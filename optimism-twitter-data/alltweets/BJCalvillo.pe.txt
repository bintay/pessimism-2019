Whether you're optimistic or pessimistic on Valentine's Day, there is one thing I think we can all agree on: Candy Hearts taste like balls

Louie is the best show on TV, and if you have a different opinion than me, that's fine because comedy is subjective (but know you're wrong)
People are going to judge you no matter what you do. Once you get the mindset of "fuck it, who cares", life becomes way more fun

It's Christmas time, so it's time to watch movies like Apocalypse Now, Scarface, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really get in the spirit

People who say that you should never be sad are either incredibly naive or complete psychopaths. Happiness cannot exist without misery.

I don't understand the point in criticizing someone's work. Art is subjective. Instead of focusing on someone else's work, create your own.
I asked my mom what she wanted for Christmas and she said "The last 20 years of my life back"

People really like sleeping, and sleeping is the closest you'll come to being dead. So, in a way, everyone is suicidal
I get high on LIFE........and copious amounts of black tar heroin

To the people asking why my Vines have gotten so dark recently, I'm simply doing what I THINK is funny. If you don't like it, tough titties.
For those who keep asking, yes; I do only have one shirt. I'm actually a 20 year old homeless person who just happens to have an iPhone
Twitter is like your mom, I'm on it too much
*Tweets about how much he loves eating junk food and watching Netflix all day, has 6 pack abs
The friend everyone hates 
Just realized that me declaring that other people don't have talent is the douchiest thing I've ever done. Who am I to declare that?
It's almost Halloween, which means a plethora of slut-shaming Vines that'll all get over 100k likes because mysogyny is funny I guess
Remember kids, murder is only acceptable if you really really really want to do it or if you never get caught #rolemodel

Be the best person you can be today......unless you don't feel like it, in which case don't worry about it, no biggie
When someone texts "be there in 10", it really means "Be there in 10 maybe, not really, fuck you, you're dead to me, jk be there in 2 hours"
If the movie adaptation of 50 Shades of Grey doesn't have full penetration I'm going to be severely disappointed and only partly aroused

The Hypocritical Father (w/@Jason23Nash) 
If you can't learn to laugh at yourself, then someone else is gonna do it for you
All these jokes about Ebola are really making me sick
McDonald's french fries are the number one worst thing you can put inside your body, the second is the Ebola Virus
When someone texts me "Bahaha", I assume what I just sent you was so hilarious you either spit out your food or you're just an idiot.
The grass is always greener on the other side.....unless the guy on the other side has a dog, then the grass is probably covered in shit
The Immature Sex Ed Teacher 
The best part about Twitter is that anyone can use it. The worst part about Twitter is that ANYONE can use it.

To me, bisexuals are the omnivores of genitalia
Saying "I love you" to someone you've never met and the only way you know of them is through a social media app on your phone is kinda weird

I once asked a girl if she wanted to play Flappy Bird, but this was back in 2011, so I was put into custody.

Got 20 mins free, so might as well do a Q&amp;A, right? I mean it's only logical. Ask me anything.
@carlyincontro cut off your leg.
I don't understand the need for mirrors on every wall at the gym. It can make even the most humble individual look like a narcissist.
Hey top Viners, please continue to make Flappy Bird Vines. I like to watch them while having a Hispanic dwarf strangle me with a belt.
If you play Flappy Bird you encourage design plagiarism. Those green pipes look awfully familiar, wouldn't ya say?

Not a bong. 
Hey guys, I'm doing a following spree! Everyone who follows me onto a busy freeway gets a trip to the hospital or morgue!
Seeing some Viners complain about the death of revine 4 revine is hilarious. It's like seeing a child get his Xbox taken away. Funny stuff.
The sexiest dog alive. 
I'm waiting for the bus at a bus stop that has no bench, basically just standing immobile on the sidewalk like a crazy person. #VineFamous

Guy who has no idea how to take a picture in his bathroom.

I'm glad the reception of Walter's return was positive. Get ready to see much more of him in the future.
Walter doesn't like David Lopez. 
I've come to the conclusion that the infomercials that are on TV today were made in 1985. In 1985 they made 4 million of them for future use

I'm gonna go ahead and assume that they stopped putting "ask your parents permission" at the end of commercials about the internet for kids.
@meRyDoon when will 'N Sync get back together? :(
So I just finished playing "Gone Home". The game was just....beautiful. Made me feel....emotions. Tears....ran down my face. Play it....NOW.

I don't like when friends of mine who I haven't seen in a while ask how I got so many followers on Vine. Sucking the devils dick, obviously.
Well then, it sounds like I failed miserably....

Paul Walker has now been confirmed as deceased. Goodbye, good sir. You will be missed by many, myself included.
So, TMZ is reporting that Paul Walker has died in a car accident. I hope this is a hoax because that is just too much irony for me to handle
For those wondering, my middle name is Javier, hence my Twitter and Instagram name being BJCalvillo. Not a reference to the act of fellatio.
People act irrationally when they are mad. Nickelback fans must be angriest people on the planet.

I wonder if kids today even know who JFK is. To them, it might as well be text slang for "Just Freaking Kidding".
@agentbizzle The benefits of being a SuperMegaUltra PowerUp Rewards Premium Plus member!
Tosh.0 is essentially "America's Funniest Home Videos" for the new generation, and that frightens me.
Since the Xbox One comes out tomorrow, I predict at least 4 racial humor vines that have a stereotypical Latino saying "Xbox Juan". Yay.

"Why did you delete that Vine you just made?" A team of highly trained ninjas broke into my house and forced me to delete, obviously.
If you've never seen the film "In Bruges", you should probably get on that, ya dingus.

Hey Tess puppy...... 
Relatable vines suck because it's mostly teens doing them. And most teens wouldn't know what comedic timing was if it fucked their sister.

So yes, if I was born a woman I would've been a huge slut. I probably would have gotten a gig hosting SNL because of it.
I don't understand why girls who have a lot of sex are to be shamed. If I had a vagina, I'd want something in there 24/7.
@imfauxreal I don't remember a time when you were "not funny", but comedy is subjective. You've always been hilarious in my opinion.
Currently watching The Shining. I feel like if they remade this film in 2013, they would have Danny say "Turn Up" instead of "Redrum".

I miss the old days when human beings didn't brutally murder other human beings. Oh wait, those days never existed. My mistake.
GTA V currently has more perfect 10's than a 50,000 dollar a night whorehouse.
@RobOnTheRun @efizzzle haha Rob I love ya man.
@RobOnTheRun @efizzzle but I don't.
I hate hypocrites folks, sorry.
@Lance210 @imfauxreal kind of hypocritical for you to say that Lance, wouldn't ya say?
That knife scene was probably my favorite scene in all of Breaking Bad thus far. So many emotions, so powerful, so masterfully executed.
Leave a hateful comment on my Vine, and your getting blocked faster than 2 jackrabbits fucking. I've had enough of this shit.
These Eyes. 
Unaired Commercials. 
Me and @Jason23Nash "Apocalypse" series is NOT sponsored by Cheez-it. It's used for comedic effect. It saddens me that this needs explaining

Jealous? 
Role model. 
I deleted my last Vine because the comments about my body from little teenage girls was making me genuinely uncomfortable. Sorry guys.
@foster_dawg @curtislepore indeed we will, Curtis, GET A PS3! Haha you could get one for like 150 now! What with the PS4 coming out and all.
@curtislepore @foster_dawg it's got multiplayer for sure. The multiplayer looks fun as hell, but I have a PS3.....fudge.
@foster_dawg I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am dude. My Vine usage is going to go down considerably for the next 3 weeks.
@foster_dawg your not going to play it as well, sir?
Turn up. 
Moms be like..... 
No shit just saw two homeless men banging in this alleyway in East LA. Precious memories!
I'm in East LA right now in an alleyway at 8 o clock at night. This is where "Vine Fame" gets ya, kids.
Vine is down again.......and so are my pants! To be honest, I don't even understand why I just typed that. This tweet is dumb.

Wow, two hate comments in a row? IM ON A ROLL TODAY! 
I wont be making a 9/11 Vine today, for those asking. My goal is to try and make you guys laugh everyday, not further bum you out.
Bruno Mars invited me to his backyard. 
Am I the only one that isn't into the idea of the Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul? Spinoffs rarely work. Remember Joey? Me neither.
I have a feeling some asshole is going to make a really offensive #september11 Vine today. The Internet, ladies and gentlemen.
Uh.....I do? That's why I put it on...you know.....MY VINE ACCOUNT. 
@rudymancuso Butt Scratcha?
Ok guys, I get it, Miley Cyrus is apparently a bad/weird person or whatever. Do we really need 70,000 more Vines explaining that?
I'm loving the comments on my last Vine right now. So many high school kids telling me to go fuck myself. My dreams have finally come true.
A teenage girl complains about the difficulties of high school. 
Let me be frank about this.... 
I think I'll pass on both the iPhone 5C and the iPhone 5S. I'll just wait till the iPhone 9J and 12Y come out in 2098 to upgrade. #Apple
Hey guys, I can't wait to get my new VinePhone 5S later this month!
Roar. 
The Worlds End is the best film I've seen in a LONG time. The first time I literally laughed out loud in a movie theater in about 2 years.
Dammit Breaking Bad, how do you expect me to function in society with a giant erection for the next 7 days? Those last 15 mins....MASTERFUL.
People are fucking goofy.
@rohmontgomery @KSmooth016 then we need to tell these sports nuts to tread lightly.
@rohmontgomery because sports bro! like testosterone bro! like fur realziez bro!

Obviously I must have copied your Vine, because I have the time to look at EVERY SINGLE VINE EVER MADE, especially ones from 2 months ago.
When someone else needs to use the bathroom. 
I haven't checked Vines Pop Page in about 3 months, and I regret absolutely NOTHING.
If literally your entire Vine is dedicated to you demeaning your race through horrible stereotypes, then just...god dammit!
No it didn't, same voice actor :) 
The last Walter Vine I just made was inspired by true events. A fan got a hold of my number and wouldn't stop texting me for weeks.
Walter won't stop texting me. 
So, I did my first TV interview ever on @AXSLive yesterday. You wanna see it? Well then click on the link, ya dingus.

@nickconfalone But honestly, I am hesitant to pick up Rayman because GTA V comes out in 2 weeks. I don't know if my wallet can take it.
@nickconfalone I know bro like WHERE ARE ALL THE GUNS AND EXPLOSIONS WHATS WITH ALL THESE COLORS AND CREATIVE CHARACTER DESIGNS?!?
But dat ass doe. 
@meRyDoon Back to the way it used to be, where if you posted a Vine in the morning and it got 5,000 likes, you were #1 on the pop page.
AWMAGAWD GUIYS, PHEED CAME OUT LIKE BEFORE VINE AND I WAS USING IT BEFORE ALL OF YOU SO THAT MEANS IM BETTER THAN YOU FOR SOME REASON.
Agree to Disagree.

My attitude when it comes to haters and hateful comments. 
#RapLikeLilWayne I will continuously rap about how much better my life is than yours and you'll pay to listen to it, because fuck logic.
Well....I've lost about 8 pounds, and I wasn't trying to. I'm no doctor, but that's probably not good, right?

Asking spammers to stop spamming in your comments is pointless, because they have the same rationale as Miley Cyrus; they can't stop.
You reading this on the toilet, just a reminder to wash your hands! Also, your sibling is probably waiting for you to finish so hurry up!

Lazy Thursday. 
To all my Vine followers, letting you know that I might Vine a bit less starting Sept. 17th. Why? Here's your answer: 
Oh bro I know right! I thought I was the only one! UNFOLLOWING FOR SURE BRO!

@VinnyMoon oh stop it you're making me blush over here.

I hate restrooms that do this.

@foster_dawg Last of Us is my GOTY so far, but GTA V comes out in less than a month, and Bioshock Infinite was incredible. 2013 games FTW.
@foster_dawg I respect your opinion, but I think nostalgia clouds our judgment without us realizing it. I love all games, new and old.

Huh...... well that's pretty cool. I'm gonna go make a sandwich now. #Vine 
AWMAGAWD GUIYZ!!! SO I TRIED TO GO ON VINE TO SEE ALL THE OFFENSIVE RACIAL HUMOR, AND IT'S LIKE NOT WORKING!!! OMGZ FML WHATAMIGONNADO!!!!!
My older Vines showed me working at Subway. I quit that place and ever since then, I became "Social Media Famous". God, that sounds so dumb.
People are under the assumption that I just sit at home all day and Vine. I have a job and when I get home, I make Vines. Mystery solved.

To clarify my last tweet, I meant any film that Adam Sandler helped write or produce, so most of them. I quite enjoyed Funny People.
#confessyourunpopularopinion I truly hate every single one of Adam Sandlers movies. Yes, even Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.
Shout. 
AWMAGAWDGUIYZ so I went on Twitter and stalked Justin Biebers feed for an hour. Like AWMAGAWD just marry me now Justin ily K bye!
For those thinking that I was holding back a laugh in my last Vine, I wasn't. I find it sad that I need to explain that.

@AllieHelms Because......um.......she makes funny faces and stuff? WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED!?!?!?!?!
@AllieHelms Shots fired. But on a serious note, is she some type of celebrity outside of Vine? That's the only rational explanation for me.
Back when I was still in high school. Look at that face, there is so much optimism, yet so much na√Øvet√©.
