@jordanclaire LOL YESS!!
@vivagazairl @rabbleca You know MM is also a white 'gal' - but it's cool when she tears down trans WOC?
OK I got myself all riled. 
We're all just secret pro-patriarchy meanies persecuting MM for funsies. #DropMM
Because of course it's all of us who are misreading her garbage. It can't be that it actually is hateful, poorly written tripe. #DropMM
I imagine the @rabbleca breakroom has super high ceilings so MM can climb up on that cross. #DropMM
It's ok, MM doesn't believe in safe spaces either. #DropMM
I guess it's only ok to throw trans people, sex workers and WOC under the bus - who cares if they feel safe at @rabbleca #DropMM
In what other context would you give a platform to someone spewing hateful shit as long as it wasn't on your site? @rabbleca #DropMM
I also think the "she didn't publish that one problematic article here" excuse is bullshit. @rabbleca #DropMM
It's really disappointing that @rabbleca would continue to give a platform to someone who is at least wilfully indifferent to transphobia
If you are a feminist who doesn't call out transphobia in your own space you are not an ally to the trans community. #DropMM
...that she doesn't mod her comments on @FeministCurrent for transphobia and really hateful shit speaks volumes. #DropMM
I don't think I've ever read anything explicitly transphobic in MM's work (although I could be wrong), but the fact...(cont)
...that targets a specific trans WOC in a moment when she is proudly and publicly being beautiful and comfortable in herself. (2/2)
People aren't attacking MM's premise that the photo shoot =/= liberation. People are attacking her sloppy attack on 'choice' feminism (1/2)
It isn't liberation, it's harm reduction - which is probably why MM doesn't understand it, because she hates harm reduction #DropMM
A trans WOC naked in Allure is just a step towards people besides thin white women being able to feel beautiful &amp; comfortable in their body
I think MM thinks we all think Laverne Cox naked in Allure is the end of patriarchy. But literally NO ONE thinks that. #DropMM
The problem is, no one ever argued that it DID. #DropMM
Listen, I get that MM is saying that a black trans woman posing naked in a fashion magazine does not equal liberation. #DropMM
Here's something transphobic she did write for you, @rabbleca - 
So @rabbleca won't #DropMM because she didn't write her most recent garbage article on their site.

These folks opposed to the new sex ed curriculum need to spend time at any abortion/sexual health clinic - you would be shocked.

I kind of have a Phoebe-from-Friends-meets-Baby-Spice-meets-Kurt-Cobain thing going on here. But fatter. It's not great.
My attempt to dress 90s style is turning out distinctly "Peggy in the 90s" which isn't really the same as "90s fashion".
In happier news, I am belatedly celebrating my birthday this weekend, starting with dancing to 90s music at Clinton's tonight. Join me!
29 minutes on hold with PC Financial so far, because I had a voicemail from them about my debit card being compromised. :(
Does anyone want my one-minute long recordings of Ed snoring? Maybe you could sample them in your new fangled music songs
Ohhh and based on my taste in movies I'm 69 years old.
FYI Buzzfeed just guessed I was 54 based on my musical tastes.
I liked this thoughtful piece on our neighbour Ron Sexsmith - who we sometimes see out on his stoop playing guitar: 
WTF is the point of HAVING Animal Services if they won't get rid of raccoons??
Someone is gonna get rabies, is all I'm sayin'.
I think it's ridiculously unsafe that the City of Toronto is basically forcing people to take care of raccoon threats themselves.
What are you supposed to do if you don't have $1000 lying around to pay for raccoon removal? Or your landlord doesn't or won't pay?
You have to get a private company to take care of them, which can cost $200 PER RACCOON
So we had a mama raccoon and 4 babies on our porch. Ed called 311 and they said the city said they animal control DOES NOT help w/ raccoons
Ok I'm going to Twitter rant about raccoons now.
Drunk and loudly indulging in Game of Thrones analysis. Ideal wife. I really strongly feel that Littlefinger is the moral center of the show
Just got a call from Ed saying "not to hurry home" bc a family of raccoons is camped out on our porch blocking the front door. Of course.
I need a haircut. I wonder what would happen if I went into Top Cuts and asked for 'the Rachel'. Is it time yet to bring that back?

APRIL FOOL!

They should make a movie about me. You know you would watch a Benjamin Button reboot starring Melissa McCarthy
I think I used to be way less of a baby about my period when I was younger. Maybe I am aging backwards.

Like I don't know about y'all but I don't go to monster movies for dramatic back stories and military politics. I'm here for monsters.
There is 15 minutes left in this movie and the monster JUST started breathing fire. Do the filmmakers not know that this is what we want??
OMG is the reveal in monster movies ever NOT that the monster is female/has already laid eggs?
I think fully 40% of the budget for Godzilla was spent on red tinted theatrical fog
The military in Godzilla are making the stupidest decisions I've ever seen in a movie. And I have watched a lot of giant monster movies
I am getting judged pretty hard by this bozo right now 
Ok you caught me I am home alone on a Saturday night watching Godzilla #sorrynotsorry
A character actually just said "I can't believe this is happening." About Godzilla v. Mothra. Seems like a given
Every character also has 1. A dramatic backstory involving dead family members, and 2. A beloved token sure to resurface significantly later
"Doctor, what did you mean when you said Godzilla is..........hunting?" Wtf do you think bro
Every actor in Godzilla graduated with honours from the Dramatic Acting School of Saying Everything Dramatically #sickburn
Ed and I have been having an intense discussion about Superbad and Mean Girls for half an hour. Wait staff are giving us looks.
My bad! That's 'Elvis's Toenail' by @TOIrishPlayers - still super great and feminist! Check it out if you're in Toronto

I like that the argument against Sean Penn's joke being racist is that he can't be racist because he helped out in Haiti. No.

Aside from beating the shit our of women, Sean Penn is a racist piece of shit.
Fuck you Sean Penn, for taking such a happy moment for this guy and reminding us all that he's foreign. Like fuck you so much.
I would refuse to collect my Oscar from Sean Penn. I would be like, no sorry, someone else needs to give this to me bc Sean Penn beats women
Sean Penn is a violent asshole

Ugh I know this is unpopular but I couldn't care less about Channing Tatum, and couldn't pick him out of a lineup
Ugh everybody just sucking Wes Anderson's dick at the Oscars so far...so basically just normal life
Oh god for a second I thought she was going to list all Wes Anderson's movies
Especially when everyone is white and looks the same
It's really hard to watch the Oscars when you're old and you don't know who anyone is
Two notes into this song, Ed said "Well, I'm bored."
We're only watching because Ed is in an Oscars pool at work. He's 1 for 1 so far!
Oh what is this movie where Mark Ruffalo doesn't have his beautiful hair...I'm upset
Like nobody loves movies this much
This song is like...I wanna look away, it's like hollywood jerking off all over itself. It feels rude to watch.
"Best and whitest" - ok everyone go home. It's not going to get better than that.

Like is there any more joyless way to consume a sitcom than through reading the script on the Internet?
I'm also remembering that bc we were behind on the episodes (in Aus), we would read the scripts of ones we hadn't seen, on the fan sites
I like how little has really changed on the Internet in twenty years
He wrote a fan fiction spin off series about Chandler and Monica, like three years before they got together on the show.
I used to frequent this website called Dan's Shrine to Friends - that guy had a whole series worth of fan fiction
If I still had my Friends fan fiction I would read it at one of those events where 30 year old hipsters read their old diaries
I wish I still had that script. They all went to Australia. There was a Phoebe song (my original composition!!) and everything.
Rewatching Friends is reminding me of the one and only time in my life that I wrote fan fiction.

"I'm just waiting for all the facts" = "women talking about their lived experiences is not fact" = "I don't believe them". Assholes.
To be fair, I've unfriended all my assholes - I'm just fighting assholes on other people's walls
Every day I think "I'll stop clogging up my FB feed with Jian Ghomeshi stuff" and every day some asshole makes that impossible
Guy just leaned out streetcar window and yelled at cops to stop hassling a black guy. "You work for me remember! Serve and protect!"
NO THANKS MONDAY TRY AGAIN NEXT WEEK
I worry about the women accusing Jian. I hope they have supportive people around them.
Fuck off Elizabeth May you are upholding rape culture, please turn in your feminist cred on the way out.

Screams of frustration punctuated by hilarious photos of lighthearted junk. That's how I roll, Twitter.
Seriously, a lot of FB friends have decided that Jian Ghomeshi is the hill they are going to die on.
Oh sorry dudes, forget to have faith that the justice system you set up &amp; still run will protect me from dangerous men. #misandry
Have felt pretty blessed by the low # of FB unfriending I've had to do in life but I guess this Jian Ghomeshi thing is the line in the sand.
I would have to say my #1 hobby is immediately regretting the milkshake I just drank
If I lived alone I could scream in frustration OUT LOUD instead of screaming in frustration into my pillow. #livingthedream
The most desperate dream of my sad little introverted heart is to live alone. To be still married, yes, and still in love, but to live alone
Oh my god if that unforgivably maudlin editorial cartoon gets shared in my FB timeline one more time...

So it's less important to us as a movement that individual feminists be elevated and widely-known. @HeatherMallick
Feminists organizing now have moved away from the individualistic, white middle class Liberal Feminism of the 2nd wave @HeatherMallick
Another reason we have no nationally-known feminists post-2nd wave is that feminism organizing is more collective now @HeatherMallick
@HeatherMallick I could name tons of current prominent Cdn feminists, and none have newspaper bylines
@HeatherMallick We do - the platform for prominence has shifted from print to internet though. Times have changed.
I have some advice, @HeatherMallick - instead of assuming we don't exist, come find us, and use your platform to raise our voices up
Someone needs to run some sort of seminar for white second wave feminists on how to use the internet
So @HeatherMallick is getting on the "where are all the young feminists?" train -

I am serious about organizing around this and happy to get the ball rolling. DM or email me if you're in. #NBProchoice
Only money and votes move govt. Anger alone will not force their hand. NB activists, I beg you, start organizing NOW!! #NBProchoice
Start thinking now about concrete action we can take - the govt is not going to act out of the goodness of their hearts. #NBProchoice
It's easy to be angry and tweet now but we need to ORGANIZE or nothing will change. #NBProChoice
I hope the Fredericton Morgentaler Clinic closing turns our anger to action. NB has been in precarious situation for too long. #NBProchoice

@cdnwomenfdn I get that orgs need corporate $ to survive - my critique is of a capitalist system that requires compliance to advertising...

"When I was talking a few weeks back with Stephen Lewis..." Oh god I just can't.
Half a standing ovation for Tom Mulcair. Awkward. #WFDF13
That last quote was the awesome @bearclannation
"We don't 'own' anything. We have a responsibility to protect and defend. That's the difference bt settler law and indigenous law" #WFDF13
If nothing else, this forum will make a lot of contrary men look up 'economic violence' #WFDF13
Starting to feel pretty crappy about flying a non-unionized airline to get here. #WFDF13
So many connections being made between land-bodies-indigenous women and how violence against one is violence against all three #WFDF13

@already_eaten @KamoWeb @julialikesbooks Re: the silence: I personally am not engaging with Par-L until the ban is lifted
This is a hilarious and pretty accurate review: 
So, in conclusion, #Orca is perfectly terrible and I highly recommend it.
You will be completely unsurprised to learn that #Orca does not pass the Bechdel Test.
Omg the special effects are SO. BAD. #Orca
The whale is now pushing an obviously styrofoam iceberg at the boat. #Orca
"I just wanted to go back to Ireland. America never suited me." Uhh...you're in Newfoundland, guy. #Orca
Icebergs! This is like Moby Dick meets Titanic. #Orca
"Polar ice can crush a boat like this." "Well ice cuts...both ways." Actual dialogue. #Orca
The whale just jumps up, roars, and eats people. I don't know why it isn't in more movies. #Orca
I feel like everyone had pointier boobs in the 70s. #Orca
Ok the whale just knocked the main character's house into the ocean. Excellent. #Orca
I thought this movie couldn't get any better, and then one of the characters starting drinking Mateus!! #Orca
"It's what the villagers want. It's what the whale wants." a great reason to do anything! #Orca
Ok the whale just blew up the dock. Awesome. #Orca
"I understand what that whale is feeling, because the same thing happened to me." Called it. #Orca
Oh now the strategy is to apologize to the whale by looking in its eyes and thinking hard about how sorry he is. #Orca
"He deliberately left you your boat because he wants to fight you on the sea!" #Orca
He just built a fake Richard Harris on the pier to lure the whale. Genius! #Orca
Oh no, he's having car crash flashbacks. I suspect it's one of those 'me and the whale are not so different' things. #Orca
Uh oh, our protagonist has run afoul of the fishermen's union! This can only mean trouble. #Orca
Oh there's religious mumbo jumbo too! This movie has everything. #Orca
Oh no, there's a wise Native fellow. All his sentences start, "I learned from my ancestors...". Yiiiiiikes. #Orca
Omg the 70s. Jumpsuits! #Orca
Whale funeral procession!! No, really. #Orca
"Climb the boom and cut the rope!" this seems like a mistake. #Orca
I like that this movie doesn't waste a lot of time with characterization or, you know, names. #Orca
Ewwww whale miscarriage!!! #Orca
Their boat is called 'Bumpo'. ??? #Orca
This film is set in Newfoundland!!! #Orca
Now it's using narration to establish information that could be revealed in dialogue. This movie thinks it's a book. #Orca
Guys. Omg. I am 9 minutes in and it's already the best/worst film I have ever seen. #Orca
This film makes maximum use of dramatic close ups and tense violin chords. #Orca
A diver is trying to hide from a shark by holding a rock over his head. I'm not even kidding. #Orca
So far, an overly long opening montage of beautiful orcas set to plinky plunky music. Cinematic gold. #Orca
I'm about to watch 'Orca', a 1977 flop about a deadly killer whale, starring Richard Harris. It can't not be amazing

@Shakestweetz Interesting point. I WAS impressed that in a movie about open water, the first death was by stabbing.

We have this feminist listserv but it's too hard to moderate when people disagree, so let's all just share news without comment

@emmamwoolley In Fredericton I recommend White Lotus. In Saint John....maybe don't get a tattoo in Saint John?
@bettylyons Absolutely! I hope it didn't seem like I was attacking you - mine was supposed to be a response to the original post. Argh PAR-L

@emmamwoolley Ok last thing - if you're at the Snooty Fox, order the Pumphouse blueberry beer
@emmamwoolley In Saint John, you should eat at Thandi. We used to drive from Fredericton just to eat there.
@emmamwoolley and if you're looking for somewhere to drink, the Snooty Fox is on the good side of average. Avoid the tannery.
@emmamwoolley If you're looking for somewhere to eat in Fton I rec Dimitri's - best &amp; cheapest Greek food you'll ever find
@emmamwoolley I got a lot of texts when that escalator was built. Like "are you coming back to Fredericton? We have an escalator now!"
@emmamwoolley OMG that bridge is way out in the country, I'm not surprised. Go to the art gallery instead! There's a Salvador Dali!

@kylembecker ..yes...and...?
@judyrebick Thank you! It means a lot.
Hey @judyrebick I see you were at CTV tonight too - they must be trying to keep the feminists separated lest we become too powerful ;)
Feat. me! MT @achangcbc Tmr on the show - the impact of one of Canada's most controversial figures, Dr. #Morgentaler on NB. That's at 7:13
@Auragasmic There probably will be SOMETHING public but we'll have to wait til the family releases a statement to know. Antis will come.
Late lunch break, on the phone with media people re: Morgentaler.
I think the idea that law=/=morality was a big one for many activists starting from a place of privilege.
Perhaps one of Morgentaler's greatest legacies was teaching many of us that there is such a thing as an unjust law.
1 thing they don't tell you about being media spokesperson: how weird it is to find out stuff from someone asking to interview you about it

I get really excited when I see 'Sharks' is trending but then I remember professional sports exist.
Oh this Toontown explosion thing is real? I thought it was viral marketing for a Roger Rabbit reboot. :-/
I got my Diet Coke, so, you know, the less said the better.
I would suck an ugly donkey's dick for a diet Coke right now. That's the kind of thing I can't say on Facebook cause my mum's there.

@eborser It was a big moment.
@eborser Living the dream! One time Ed went to TB down the street from us here, got to the front of the line, and then walked away.
@eborser That is sad times. I wonder if he got Mrs. Vanelli's.
@epileptrick Yeeeaahhhh gotta get that miso-whatever - also good stuff.
@epileptrick Good luck! Take lots of deep breaths. And whatever drugs they recommend (I took a lorazepam and it was the tits).
So I gather from various FB status updates that Justin Trudeau is kind of hanging around Fredericton today. Being a politician is a raw deal
Just FYI everyone, all is well with my IUD.

He would have special gloves to file briefs so as not to get Dorito dust on them. And no one would want to be his client because he smells.
Another idea I had yesterday was a reality show about a lawyer addicted to Doritos. 'Fart Chip Lawyer'
Someone needs to invent this: self heating, disposable wet naps you keep by the bed. Suggested name: Wet Faps.
I don't want to shock you guys, but there are some really hideous necklaces on Etsy.
