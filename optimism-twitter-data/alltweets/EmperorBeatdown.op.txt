@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's lips puckered up just in time. He returned that sweet kiss and then some.
@iKawaiiMomo "I missed you too baby~" Ryuji smiled lightly as he leaned in close for a kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's arms then laced around Momo's waist, giving her his full attention as well.
@iKawaiiMomo "A little, but it's no big deal baby..."
@iKawaiiMomo -made some pretty cool friends. It was pretty fun."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alot of things. Had to have competition with this other weird treasure hunter, got into a fight with the local mafia, and -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then plants a sweet kiss onto her forehead as she held the flowers close before taking off his jacket.
@iKawaiiMomo - the flowers.
@iKawaiiMomo "I got em not too long ago. I ran into a flower shop as I was coming back home." Ryuji said as he walked in and handed Momo -
@iKawaiiMomo - getly, his golden hues peering into hers.
@iKawaiiMomo "Sorry I took so long, that treasure was really hard to find." He then placed one of his hands upon her head and patted it -
@iKawaiiMomo - "I'm back, Momo~" Ryuji said, followed with a light chuckle.
@iKawaiiMomo And there stands Ryuji, holding a bouquet of flowers and showing that big, optimistic smile he knew Momo loved so much. -
@iKawaiiMomo -arriving back from his mission. The first place he went was at Momo's, to apologize to her for being MIA for so long.
@iKawaiiMomo A small knock on Momo's front door was heard after the doorbell rang. Outside of that door was none other than Ryuji himself, -
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown Yuuuup.
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown Gone-
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown "COOKIES!?-"
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown Awkward silence.
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown "..."
@PrinceBeatdown @ExperimentWings "Y-Yea..." Ryuji calmed down, a slight smile on his face as he kept his gaze on Kohana.
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji follows Ryan's instructions precisely. A small blush on his cheeks due to embarrassment.
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown "Gah! I told you so, Ryohei! Crap...what do I do!?"
"Huh...? I ain't that good looking...am I?" #OpenRP 
@PrinceBeatdown @ExperimentWings "Huh? Ryohei, I don't think this is such a good ide--"
@PrinceBeatdown @ExperimentWings "I don't see how that's such a bad thing. She really likes you, bro."
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown "Aww...~"
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji almost died as he stared at little Kohana. Her cuteness was deadly. "Holy shit she's adorable."
@ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown And here the two would rush in, a wide and cheerful smile on their faces. "Hey, Ry!"
@DevilishBlack A wry smile then conjured onto the hunter's face. He was happy to spend some time with his old partner.
@DevilishBlack "Hmm...why not try? I haven't sparred you in a while."
@DevilishBlack "Aww, come on. Don't be like that partner~"
@DevilishBlack "So? Some is still some."
@DevilishBlack "We aren't on some missions, and you know that Yuki."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then smiled as their lips parted. "Don't worry baby~ I won't be gone for long~"
@DevilishBlack "We aren't in conflict all the time."
@iKawaiiMomo Several kisses were then planted onto his treasure's lips as his hand was placed onto her cheek.
@DevilishBlack "Why not?"
@DevilishBlack "Oh c'mon. You know more than I do that we're good friends, Yuki."
@DevilishBlack Dodge. Tease.
@iKawaiiMomo "Aww...baby...you look really sad..."
@DevilishBlack "Oh c'mon, don't be like that to your BEST FRIEND!~"
@DevilishBlack "What the...I sent those...?" Completely oblivious. Dense as fuck right now.
@DevilishBlack "Suuuure it will~"
@DevilishBlack "I have no idea what you're talking about~"
@iKawaiiMomo "I'm sorry for not telling you baby...but the pay is really nice and I just took the job."
@DevilishBlack "Hehe, what's wrong with that partner?"
@iKawaiiMomo "I might be gone for a day or two honey...going somewhere far away..." He hugged her back just as tight.
@DevilishBlack "I was excited that my brother is working with Ryoto? What?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hehe~ I'm gonna head out now bae..."
@DevilishBlack "Huh? How'd you know that?"
@DevilishBlack -become a hunter. He doesn't know what kind of hunter to be though..."
@DevilishBlack "That sounds...dull. Welp, I've been going on missions with a whole bunch of different people...OH! And Ryohei is trying to-
@DevilishBlack "So Yuki...how's life been for ya?"
@DevilishBlack And Yukio would be the first Ryuji would want to bring with him. Wait, scratch that. Momo was first.
@iKawaiiMomo "Shhh~" Ryuji then placed his lips against hers once more.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hehe~" Ryuji smiled brightly upon witnessing her reaction.
@DevilishBlack "To the grocery store!~" Ryuji had completely ignored the hunter's statement, marching towards the grocery store cheerfully.
@iKawaiiMomo "Boo!~" Ryuji playfully whispered in her ear, hoping to startle her slightly.
@DevilishBlack "Huh? So you wanted me to go grocery shopping with you?"
@DevilishBlack "Ahhh, can't hear you!~"
@DevilishBlack "I only insisted to get flowers for her because you said we were going to a flower shop!"
@iKawaiiMomo -did. Upon finishing, he walked over towards the counter, about to pay his bill, and Momo a little visit before he left.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then enjoyed the coffee and cookies as she left. The cookies tasted really good, but not as good as his treasure's lips -
"It's hard to belive I used to look like this back then.." 
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiled as their lips parted slowly, staring into those Azure hues that always sparkled like Sapphires. "Thanks, babe~"
@iKawaiiMomo -savoring every second of their kissing.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji chuckled slightly, puckering his lips and leaning closer also. Eventually, he would feel those soft lips against his own-
@iKawaiiMomo "You forgot the most important thing, babe. Momo's lips~"
"Yukio, what kind of mission is this...!?" @DevilishBlack 
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh, Momo you're back!~" Ryuji smiled once he saw his treasure had returned once again.
@DeceivedWings - That one hurt...a lot!" The hunter then summoned his white aura once again, stronger than before. "...."
@DeceivedWings would still feel the immense pain from that elbow. Ryuji would then stumble forward slightly, holding his head. "Ow, shit..!-
@DeceivedWings Having no other options to counter this, Ryuji took the attack. Direct hit. Even if he had coated his head with Nen, he -
@DeceivedWings //Oh shit nigga
@Insanity_Wings //This nigga...
@Insanity_Wings //redo it in the right order then.
@Insanity_Wings //whatever nigga.
@Insanity_Wings -. He wanted the Angel to use everything he had against the treasure hunter so that he could completely dominate him.
@Insanity_Wings -red aura. "You're gonna have to punch faster if you wanna hit me, yaknow." Ryuji taunted the male with a smirk on his face-
@Insanity_Wings -uppercut with ease. A strong, white aura then shrouded his body, eventually growing bigger and clashing with the angel's-
@Insanity_Wings - would lose her shit if she saw the hunter with so much as a bruise. Ryuji then would jump back, evading the angel's -
@Insanity_Wings - he seemed stronger than the scrubs he took out before, but he didn't want to end up injured again. His girlfriend, Momo, -
@Insanity_Wings -was on his mind was that he had to dodge his attacks. Sure, he was interested in seeing the strength of this angel, since-
@Insanity_Wings Ryuji's hues didn't even have to look down to figure out what the angel's next move was going to be. The only thing that-
@Insanity_Wings -jaw.
@Insanity_Wings  The angel's anticipation would soon come to an end. Faster than he knew it, Ryuji's Nen- enhanced fist was now against his-
@Insanity_Wings //especially*
@Insanity_Wings -sorts of fucks to give. Expecially to an angel.
@Insanity_Wings "Get. The fuck. Out. Of. My face. Geez, I didn't know angels were rude AND retarded." Ryuji glared at the angel, not having-
@Insanity_Wings "No. Now get the fuck outta my face. If you don't, I'll make sure you won't be able to fly again."
@Insanity_Wings "You're a goddamn angel. Why don't you ask god or whatever for them?"
@Insanity_Wings -want?" Ryuji instantly greeted the angel with hostility. He IS an angel, after all. And he wasn't really too fond of angels
@Insanity_Wings 'An angel...' The hunter then would rise up from his seat, turning around to face the mysterious figure. "The hell do you -
@Insanity_Wings "It depends. Who's asking?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then relaxed at the table, waiting in anticipation for his treasure to return.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...Cookies, Coffee, And a hint of Momo's lips~"
@iKawaiiMomo "You can get me something?" Ryuji smiled and raised an eyebrow.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yuup!~ Treasure ain't gonna find itself."
@iKawaiiMomo -decided to stop by the cafe. The reason he came there, no one knows~ (Pfft. Momo, obviously.)
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh..." Ryuji smiled as he saw that beautiful smile he loved so much. He was just about to head off on a mission again and -
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey there, Momo."
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "C'mon, Ryo." Ryuji then walks back inside with Momo and Ryohei.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Alright bro, time to get some sleep."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "I guess I'll cya round then Alice." Ryuji smiled and waved goodbye.
@ExperimentWings Little Piggy is adorable.
@ExperimentWings "Hmm...fits." Ryuji smiles lightly. "He's kinda cute."
@ExperimentWings "Oh...What's his name?" Ryuji then pats the piglet gently.
@ExperimentWings "What ever happened to Killer?"
@ExperimentWings "What does he want with a pig?"
@ExperimentWings "Where the...where did you get that?"
@ExperimentWings"...."
@ExperimentWings "What the...? First Momo now you...?"
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Just go, Ryohei."
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Ryohei..."
@ResolvedHunter @PrinceBeatdown "Then I'll just work with Yukio!" Ryuji said as the hunter left the room.
@ResolvedHunter "Ugh, fine. Whatever...I'm just gonna work with Yukio or Kentaro next time..."
@ResolvedHunter "Gold. Gold necklace."
@ResolvedHunter "What the...I already paid you back!"
@ResolvedHunter "There's no way I'm giving you that much money. I have bills to pay, asshole."
@ResolvedHunter "Wh-What? Hell no!"
@ResolvedHunter "Alrighty. And by the way, about that money..."
@ResolvedHunter "Yup. He ain't all that bad, yaknow. He's pretty strong too."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Aww, I'll cya later Al "
@ResolvedHunter "Yea, well, he's also your partner for that mission you gave me. I'm gonna leave it in his hands today."
@ResolvedHunter "Oh, so you met Ryohei?"
@ResolvedHunter Ryuji relaxes on the couch, humming a tune. His eyes then open, staring at the white-haired hunter. "Yo."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown Pouts.
@ResolvedHunter "Yo." Ryuji said, the voice was heard from inside the living room.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Why do you guys say that like it's a bad thi--Alice stop glaring at me..."
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Yea. She was all like 'Oh noooooo...~ Ryoheiiii~' "
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Yupp. Sure did."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Yup..." Ryuji said softly, his hand reaching over to pat his little brother's head gently.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Heh. Nice to have ya back, bro."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Y-Yea...did he get taller too?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -secretly astonished by his brother's new look.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Ehh...I just think that Ryohei doesn't wanna hurt her, is all." Ryuji tries to keep calm,-
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo -that his brother was nearby.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji would let out a slight yawn as he was relaxing with Momo, completely unaware and oblivious -
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Ahh man...It's been a week and no sign of Ryohei.." Ryuji muttered as he relaxed on the sofa.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo -cranky when woken up." Ryuji then would hold Momo in his arms and carry her to his room.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Alrighty. Help yourself to anything you want in here. But uhh...no loud noises, please. Momo gets reeeeally-
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "What about you, Al?"
@AliceAkuma  @iKawaiiMomo "Heh..." Ryuji smiled as he watched the girl, noticing the disappearance of that frown.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiles as the tree of them smiled eand watched the movie happily.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo The movie then starts playing, Ryuji occasionally feeding Momo some popcorn.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Picks up the remote and presses the play button, smiling.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Yup." Ryuji then placed the bag on a nearby couch and laid back on the couch, near momo.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Don't worry about it, Eric." Ryuji smiled as he took the bag and waved as he walked away.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "It's Eric...!" Ryuji yelled slightly, attempting to call for Alice. "Thanks, Eric. "
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji stopped midway to the kitchen to go answer the door.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Movie's about to start, Al. You should go take a seat."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then walked over towards the kitchen after finishing up with the movie and patting Alice's head once more. -
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Alrighty." Ryuji was already setting up the perfect movie. "Snacks, anyone?"
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Momo. I think we should get a comedy movie. Laughter will cheer her right up."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Go call up this Eric guy. We'll find the perfect movie for you."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Alright!~ We got a smile!~"
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Wanna spend the night over here, Alice? We'll watch movies n chill n stuff."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Nope. We aren't. Get used to it, sis."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "Hmm..." Ryuji then stood there, trying to find a way to make her happy.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "You don't have to lie to us, Alice. Come inside..."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "A couple months is too long.."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "A couple months? Holy shit..."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "How long did he say he was gonna be gone for?" he said in a soft tone as he patted Alice's head gently.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo -didn't he just tell me...?"
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo"Oi, Oi. Don't cry, Al." Ryuji then tried to comfort the girl. "Damn...so that's what he meant...that idiot, why -
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo what's wrong, Al?" He said as he saw her depressed facial expression.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then got up, opening the door. As soon as he saw Alice, he frowned. He didn't even bother to greet her. "...-
@AliceAkuma Ryuji then looked over at Momo. "We weren't expecting anyone, were we...?"
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo -situation with Ryohei, or Alice's arrival.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji was relaxing on the couch, snuggled up close with his precious treasure. He was completely unaware of the-
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //Ehehe...y-yea.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "Yup."

//Wtf--

"Shut up. You two have no say anymore."
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //will a "It's complicated" suffice? 

"No."

//Fuck you, Ryuji.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //...
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //uhm...
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //No reason. None. At. All...
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //Ehehe...hehe...he
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ //ow, my ears...
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ //*smiles* Cute.
@iKawaiiMomo //S-Sorry Dani...
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //Ehehe...
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ //Ehehe...S-Sorry, but it's true.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //hmm...you should do it, dani. Doesn't sound like he's gonna stop anytime soon.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //holy shit, humanity? I didn't know I was that important...
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //what, really? I'm sorry..I didn't know...:3
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "Uhm..."

//I mean, sure. Only if she wants to tho.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //wtf?
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "Huh, what?"
@iKawaiiMomo And then the plate was clean. Absolutely spotless.
@iKawaiiMomo //*looks at writer-chan, about to dip*

"Oh no you don't. You're not going anywhere.
@iKawaiiMomo //*laughing nervously*

STAREEEE
@iKawaiiMomo "They're definetely hiding something..."

//Uhh...no...?
@iKawaiiMomo //Ehehe...yep. All fine.

"..."
@iKawaiiMomo "No...Problem!" Is currently stuffing his mouth with onigiri.
@iKawaiiMomo "10/10!~"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then sat down at the dinner table and did just that.
@iKawaiiMomo Drool. Drool. Listen. Drool.
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh...god." Ryuji's eyes lit up. The wonderful aroma and the sight of Momo's magnificent cooking alone made him drool slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo The hunter then got up and headed to the kitchen in a hurry.
@iKawaiiMomo After going into the bathroom to fully change, Ryuji sat on the couch, waiting in anticipation.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright babe~ I can't wait~" Ryuji sighed as he started to take off his jacket and shoes.
@iKawaiiMomo "Well, yea. But that would kinda defeat the whole purpose of you cooking for me."
@iKawaiiMomo "If you want, I could help you cook." Ryuji said as he walked in after her.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then pulled out his keys, opening the door for Momo.
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm!" Ryuji exclaimed as they were at the house.
@iKawaiiMomo "Ehehe...~ Alright~" Ryuji smiled sheepishly, day dreaming about Momo's cooking as they grew closer to the house.
@iKawaiiMomo "Onigiri...~ " Drool
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...what do you know how to make bae?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hehe, alright!"
@iKawaiiMomo //*walks off*

"..."
@iKawaiiMomo //I'll just...get going.

"Sorry writer-kun..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...why don't you try cooking tonight? I haven't tried your cooking in a while, babe."
@iKawaiiMomo //*sigh* Thanks guys. Thanks a lot...

"No pro--Oh. Sarcasm."
@iKawaiiMomo "I hope you don't mind being at my place again. I'm kinda tired from work..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Okay, Okay. We'll stop teasing the fact that you two--"
//SHUT. UPPPPPP.
@iKawaiiMomo //you guys...

"What?~"
@iKawaiiMomo /O-Oh...

" About us..." Ryuji mimics writer-chan teasingly.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey there, Mo."

//Wtf are you guys talking about?
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...so, where do you wanna go baby?"
@iKawaiiMomo //huh?

Snicker. Giggle.
@iKawaiiMomo "Why so enthusiastic? You wanna chill with me?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup." Ryuji smiled as they walked, giving her all of his attention.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea...Cya later, birdface." Ryuji said as he waved bye to the male and walking off with his bae.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then patted Momo's head before hugging her back.
@iKawaiiMomo "And that about does it." Ryuji said, dusting off his hands. He then turned around to Momo. "You alright, Mo?"
@iKawaiiMomo -punches hit the male.
@iKawaiiMomo "Sure you will, birdface." Ryuji then charged at the male, swinging with extreme precision. Almost every single one of his-
@iKawaiiMomo "..3." Ryuji then threw his fists up, ready to fight.
@iKawaiiMomo -a slightly nen-enhanced punch head on and see if he could withstand the hit.
@iKawaiiMomo Before Tsuo knew it, Ryuji's fist was already too near his face to block or dodge. The only thing left for him to do was take-
@iKawaiiMomo -go of her."
@iKawaiiMomo -don't like how close you are with my girl..." He said as he moved closer, cracking his knuckles. "You've got 3 seconds to let-
@iKawaiiMomo As the boy was talking to Momo, he felt another rock hit his face, causing him to let go of Momo. "Oi, birdface. I seriously-
@iKawaiiMomo -wait. Nevermind. I didn't miss at all.~"
@iKawaiiMomo -annoying the shit outta me, but I think I missed..." Ryuji said as he peered at the slight bruise on the boy's forejead. "Oh-
@iKawaiiMomo -I think I lost my prized rock somewhere around here...You see, I was trying to throw it at this nearby pigeon that was-
@iKawaiiMomo As Momo was sitting there, hugging herself, A very familiar voice could've been heard. "Yo. Sorry to disturb you man but..-
@iKawaiiMomo As soon as Momo had raised her voice, a rock could be seen hitting the boy right in the forehead. Bullseye.
@iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji then looked upon the floor, picking up a nearby rock from the pavement. "This should do it."
@iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji's eyes narrowed slightly as he leaned against a nearby tree. He decided he was going to watch the two a little more
@iKawaiiMomo - if he should approach her or not.
@iKawaiiMomo - "Hmm..?" He watched her at the fountain from afar, noticing that she was deep in thought. At that moment, he also pondered-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji had just got done with hunting and was heading home. On his way back to his house, he had spotted his girlfriend, Momo. -
@yourwaifubot //Lemme see who my waifu is
@iKawaiiMomo "Mwah~ &lt;3"
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, you..." Ryuji reached out to his treasure, holding her cheek as if he wanted a kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo "You...~"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...time for one last thing to make me feel all better..."
@iKawaiiMomo "N-Nothing..." Ryuji smiled weakly as she prepared a relief patch for him.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's heavy breathing then stopped, staring up at his treasure. His hand then stroked her thigh.
@iKawaiiMomo "...Well, alright..."
@iKawaiiMomo "...Yea, are you sure you aren't mad at me bae...? You still look furious..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Th-Thanks babe..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji laid on his bed, his forehead buried in his palm.
@DevilishBlack "Heh, you know I am~"
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright..."Ryuji then started to head towards his roo..
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea...didn't work..."
@iKawaiiMomo She felt his abnormally high temperature. He now had a fever. "Well, okay..."
@iKawaiiMomo "I'm sorry for leaving you hanging like that, it won't happen again.." Ryuji then slowly started to shift his hues downward.
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe...please don't lie to me ..."
@iKawaiiMomo "But, Babe..." Ryuji let go of his head and fixated his eyes upon Momo, his frown growing even more.
@iKawaiiMomo "Are you sure it's okay? You still seem ma--Ugh..!" Ryuji then clutched his head in pain.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yesterday, right...Baby I'm sorry, I didn't feel well...I still don't feel well..I feel worse, actually.."
@iKawaiiMomo -the way he spoke was miserable. He then stared at Momo aith a melancholy look. "H-Hey, Mo..."
@iKawaiiMomo As Ryuji slowly opened his door, Momo could see the huge wave of fatigue written all over his face. His facial expression and -
"Hehe, Smart Ryu~"

//You're still on that? e_e 
@DevilishBlack "You ready, partner..?" 
@iKawaiiMomo "I love you baby...~" 
@iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "Yea." Ryuji then got up and said his goodbyes to the couple.
@iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "He still looks like he's in pain, but he's a little better.."
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "Yea...Ryohei is probably up now.."
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo "Ugh...You're so dead..."
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "That's the second time now.."
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai -kick to his hand.
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai "Heh..I think she likes me--OW!" Ryuji quickly pulled his hand back after getting a fierce-
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamura"Er..sure." Ryuji then walked towards the two, kneeling down as he gently rubbed Ryan's stomach.
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai "Hmm? 'Sup, Ry?"
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai Ryuji then picked up the pillow, looking over at the two.
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "...Ow?"
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo "Agreed."
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings -stop moving. Heh"
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings "I am intelligent with my battles. My number one strategy is: Always keep punching til they-
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings "Ugh, everything is about looking fancy to you isn't it? I don't need a fighting style either!
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo "I wouldn't be so sure about that, Ken. I technically am stronger than you~"
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings -with his teasure. 

//As*
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings "Hmph. I don't need some shitty katana to kick your ass, Ken." Ryuji said ad he walked inside-
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings "W-What was that, you third-rate swordsman?" Ryuji glared at Kentaro slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "What do you mea--Ohhh..."
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "I dunno. Just seems like they'll be alright."
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai "Mhmm..." Ryuji stared at the samurai, then soon later at Momo. "Maybe we should go...?"
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo "Well, shit. Looks like you were right, Momo. They were just fine.."
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings "Oh, thank god..." Ryuji sighed in relief and smiled. "How about you, Ken-chan? You ok?"
@KasaiNoSamurai @iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings "Yea. Nice to see you too." Ryuji said with an annoyed face. "How's Ryan?
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo They would soon hear the soft knock on their door. "I sure hope they're here..."
@iKawaiiMomo @KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "You do? What makes you say that?"
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo -face.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings -there. He then held @iKawaiiMomo's hand as they walked, trying to hide the worryful expression on his -
As Ryuji left the house, he then started walking towards the Date residence, thinking that @KasaiNoSamurai and @ExperimentWings would be-
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Yea." Ryuji got up and stretched lightly, heading for the door.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Well, Alright. I'll leave the house and Ryohei to you, Alice."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "What about you though baby? You gonna stay here with Alice?"
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji's hues also wandered off to his brother, worrying about his well being.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "..heh." Ryuji smiles and lets out a sigh of relief.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -head, trying to comfort his treasure.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "I told you baby..I'll always be by your side, alright?" Ryuji smiled reassuringly and patted her -
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Babe...please don't cry..." Ryuji stared at his treasure, his frown growing even more.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma -to visit the Date residence to check up on Ryan after he had gotten some rest.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma -down. He still had that really saddened look on his face. The hunter then decided that he was -
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "Alright..." Ryuji sighed, knowing that she was going to keep insisting until he said yes and sat-
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "H-Huh...? But...I'm fine, really..."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji looked over at Momo, giving her all of his attention for a breif moment. "Y-Yea...thanks..."
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma -A huge wave of guilt then hit Ryuji as he thought about Ryan's bruise and Ryohei.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "I..I don't know...She has a bruise on her stomach, but...shit...I should've done something..." -
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown -" Ryuji stared at his brother, frowning.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "They captured Ryan, that girl with the cookies. They were gonna kill her because she was pregnant.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Y-Yea..I'm sorry babe..."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown - he looked downwards, thinking they wouldn't believe them.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Yea...he got stabbed..we uhh...we got into a huge Fight with an army of angels..." Ryuji said as-
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "...Tch..." Ryuji looked away, feeling like this was completely his fault.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown -didn't want to rest. He really wanted to be at his brother's side right now.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "R-Rest? But Ryohei...my brother..." He looked at her, then at Ryohei. As much as she was true, he-
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "...Alright." He then slowly started to let go of Ryohei, allowing her to carry him.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -of his back. "He won't move one bit, yaknow..."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Are you sure you'll be able to carry him...?" Ryuji said to Alice as she tried to take Ryohei off-
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -stained with a crimson red color, like blood....
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -probably got them even more worried as he saw the bruises and wounds. Their clothes were also -
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -at the moment. He looked at the two of them with a sorrowful and exhausted look on his face. That-
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "..." Ryuji wanted to speak, but he just couldn't. He was too emotionally and physically drained -
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -waiting for them. He then sighed and walked closer to them, preparing for the worst.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -As he reached his house, his hues shifted upwards, glancing at the two very familiar females -
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -fight with the angels. He was also carrying his unconcious  little brother, Ryohei, on his back.-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "..." Ryuji silently walked towards his house, covered in bruises and wounds from the earlier -
#KidnappedWings Ryuji then walked over towards the bunch, thinking Ryan was safe and Ayaka was there with his brother.
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji sits there awkwarly, not knowing what to do.
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh...ehehe, Sorry hun..." Ryuji says as he notices the couple.
#KidnappedWings -carving the angel's face into the pavement. He was now letting everly last ounce of his anger out on it.
#KidnappedWings - curbstomping, creating a crater. The angel was now bathing in a pool of it's own blood at this moment, but Ryuji kept-
#KidnappedWings -gettin' yer ass beat by a lowly human! A treasure hunter!" He yelled and taunted as he continued his merciless-
#KidnappedWings - over, and over, and over til his heart's content. "What's wrong? Aren't you supposed to be an all-powerful angel!? You're-
#KidnappedWings Ryuji then kicked the Angel 's face onto the floor as it leaped for the sword. He then started to stomp on it's face -
@iKawaiiMomo -his golden hues peered into her azure ones.
@iKawaiiMomo -focused on his blonde haired, beautiful treasure, Momo, to even care. He had then spoke the words "I love you..." softly as-
@iKawaiiMomo As the fireworks stopped, their lips then parted. Nearly everyone in the area was staring at the couple, but Ryuji was too -
@iKawaiiMomo -two of them kissing under the fireworks.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji and Momo's kiss only grew deeper from that point. A couple of "Aww~"s can be heard from the people who glanced at the-
@iKawaiiMomo As soon as she looked at him, their lips were already pressed upon each other.
@iKawaiiMomo "Not as beautiful as my Momo..." Ryuji said as his hand was placed on Momo's cheek, moving her face to his.
@iKawaiiMomo "Woah...beautiful..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's arm snaked around Momo's frame and pulled her closer. "Yup..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiled and sat at a nearby bench, enjoying the view of the night sky that would soon be filled with fireworks.
#TankSquad 
#KidnappedWings  -back as hard as he could.
#KidnappedWings - "Get the hell up. I know you can still fight...." he said as he taunted the angel, wanting him to at least TRY to fight -
@EmperorBeatdown #KidnappedWings -murderous glare and gradually increasing aura was starting to send chills down the scrub angels' spines.-
#KidnappedWings - gloves. His hair started to change into a jet black color, same with his hues changing into a scarlet red color. Ryuji's -
#KidnappedWings -point. His anger showed no limit. "Now I'm pissed..." He muttered as he dropped the blade and started to take off his-
#KidnappedWings - flew back, eventually hitting the floor, Ryuji walked further towards him. He was standing infront of his brother at this-
#KidnappedWings -his hand as he pulled the angel enen further to him, punching him in his side with an overwhelming force. As the angel-
#KidnappedWings Ryuji's hand reached forward and grabbed the angel's blade. He completely ignored the fact that blood was now dripping from-
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...don't fireworks come out at this time babe?"
#KidnappedWings - "RYOHEI!" he cried out as he dashed to his aid, slaughtering any angel that got in his way.
#KidnappedWings  Ryuji's eyes widened as he looked towards Ryohei's direction, seeing his brother being stabbed by one of the angels. -
@iKawaiiMomo "Of course they do, baka."
@iKawaiiMomo "Of course. Don't all treasure hunters grow attached to their most valuable treasure?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Welp. They do say that the shrine really does grant wishes, and I really want to be with you..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Wow, really?"
#KidnappedWings -overwhelm him, he held an unconcious one by their leg and swung him into the others in an attempt to push them back.
#KidnappedWings - is that all you angels got!?" He said, taunting the winged assailants. As they started to use their large numbers to-
#KidnappedWings Ryuji's rage showed literally no end as he continued to brutally beat the everloving shit out of the angels. "Come on, -
#KidnappedWings Ryuji then picked up a nearby oak tree, hurling it towards the mob of angels before charging at them.
@iKawaiiMomo As they ended the kiss, Ryuji smiled as he grew lost in her hues.
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm." As she hugged him, he pressed his lips against hers.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup. That was my wish, ehehe..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...Don't worry about it bae. Sooner or later we'll be here at this festival with a family of our own."
#KidnappedWings Ryuji headed to the park, a strong white aura shrouding his body. It seemed to grow even stronger as he grew closer.
#KidnappedWings  Ryuji ran to the park with Ryohei, putting his gloves on in a hurry. Shit was gonna go down.
#KidnappedWings "The park, huh? Lets go..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...You alright, momo?" Ryuji said as he noticed her gazing at the families.
@iKawaiiMomo He hummed as he carried his bae, looking for another place to go before it got dark.
@iKawaiiMomo "You aren't changing my mind." Ryuji said as he stared back, smiling cheerfuly.
"Tell me about it...Those shitheads are history..!" Ryuji stated, entering the house finally. #KidnappedWings
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup..." Ryuji then held her in his arms, carrying his precious treasure.
@EmperorBeatdown #KidnappedWings -as the infuriated Ryuji walked out. Whoever did this to Ryan is gonna pay, with their lives.
@EmperorBeatdown #KidnappedWings -usually gets into fights, and his favorite jacket. The next thing was heard was a loud slam of the door -
#KidnappedWings-mind was: 'Who the fuck did this..? They're so dead...' Ryuji instantly got up, grabbed the gloves he usually uses when he-
#KidnappedWings "...What the...fuck?" As Ryuji saw the text, he bacame engulfed in a strong sense of anger. The first thing that came to -
@iKawaiiMomo "...!" Ryuji quickly caught the blonde beauty in his arms, saving her fall.
@iKawaiiMomo "You'll find out sooner or later~"
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup. Something really good." Ryuji held her hand as they walked away from the shrine.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then opened his eyes shortly after, looking over at Momo and smiling.
@iKawaiiMomo -this with momo. Especially when we get married and have kids...'
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji does the same, chanting the wish in his head. 'I wish for me to be able to come back to this festival many times after-
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup hehe~"
@iKawaiiMomo As they waited for a really long time, the couple were now at the front of the line.
@iKawaiiMomo "...well then." They immediately became greeted with a waiting line. A HUGE waiting line.
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm. It's top secret."
@iKawaiiMomo "I see...I hope my wish comes true."
@iKawaiiMomo "The shrine looks even better than the festival. How the hell does that work...?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji held her hand slightly tighter as he helped her walk up the stairs to the shrine. He didn't want her tripping at all.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yep. I kinda want to make a wish about something..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...how about the shrine?"
@iKawaiiMomo After they ate the delicious Takoyaki, Ryuji questions why Momo has been staring at the shrine a lot.
@iKawaiiMomo "I had to get it for bae~"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji had noticed her gazing over at the shrine, deciding to go there after eating some takoyaki.
@iKawaiiMomo "N-No."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright, fine." He mutters as he continues to walk around the festival, eventually stopping by q takoyaki stand.
@iKawaiiMomo "Neither of those are true..."
@iKawaiiMomo "R-Ryu-chan?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm....I dunno..."
@iKawaiiMomo "No problem babe-~" He said as he smiled, rubbing the waist of his treasure.
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh~" He then turned around, handing the teddy to Momo
@iKawaiiMomo - Near his face. "Hmph. I'll take the teddy."
@iKawaiiMomo -through the cups as well as through the wall directly behind the man. He stood there in complete shock as the ball was flung -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then coated the ball with a tad bit of nen, going into a pitcher's stance in baseball. As he threw the ball, it broke -
@iKawaiiMomo -cheating of his own.
@iKawaiiMomo "...give me one more ball..." He then realized the man was cheating. Big time. Ryuji decided  he was gonna do a little -
@iKawaiiMomo And then, just like that, all three cups wasted. "What the hell!?" He didn't realize the cups were glued to the counter."
@iKawaiiMomo Afer taking the balls, all of his attention was at the target, the stack of cups.
@iKawaiiMomo -his treasure. "Alright! Three balls please!" He says cheerfuly as he slams the money on the table.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...." He notices one of the prizes is a big adorable teddy bear. This immediately drives him to win the teddy bear for
@iKawaiiMomo -play one of his games.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...so...what to do--" Ryuji stopped as he was greeted by a person behind a counter. He was obviously trying to make him-
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...games first, then?"
@iKawaiiMomo "So...what should we do first?"
@iKawaiiMomo Cue the interlocked fingers as he stared at the festival in awe. "Woah..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alrighty then." Ryuji snirked as they grew closeby.
@iKawaiiMomo "So, where is the festival hun?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji walked next to Momo after locking the door behind him, smiling as he had his hands buried into his pockets.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright Alright..." Ryuji got up and stretched, opening the door for Momo.
@iKawaiiMomo "You bet your ass I am."
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Yea. Now go away. PLEASE."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //...gonna kill him.

"Hah!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Yea, sure. Go see your girlfriend or whatever."
@iKawaiiMomo "You fucking moron..."

//Ehehe...
@iKawaiiMomo //oh. Shit...did I really just post that on the wrong RP?
@iKawaiiMomo "Wow. I would've never imagined YOU would wanna stop talking."
@iKawaiiMomo "...How did they know...?"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "I never wanted you to-- fuck it. I'm not letting you get to me..."

//He already did tho--

"SHUT UP!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Tch....I'm gonna seriously make you shut up one day..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Months ago!? That was two weeks ago you moron!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo -your ass a second time!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "You're the one who should be glad. This 'Rich White Guy' didn't call those bikers up and paid them to kick-
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Why you little...!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Not anymore!" Ditto.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "SHE ISN'T YOU IDIOT! No one's cuter than my Momo."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Yea, sure."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Hmm? She can't be that cute. Not as cute as my treasure, Momo."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Yea you are. Don't lie."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo Nonchalantly records everything.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo Casually grabs camera.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Ain't that cute. He's blushing."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Aww, don't be so serious Rin. CAN'T TAKE A JOKE HMM?~"
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Tch. Is she a pest like you?"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo Bonks Rin on the head. Extra hard.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Gonna kill him..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo Casually clenches fist and walks towards Rin.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Of course I did~"
@iKawaiiMomo "I've got...no idea."
@iKawaiiMomo - we gonna do now?" he asked, trying to think of a way to pass the time.
@iKawaiiMomo After the  kiss, Ryuji's hues wander around the room for a breif moment before fixating themselves back on Momo. "So, what are-
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright..." Ryuji smiled and held her hand tight, leaning in for a kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo "Welp. Now I can't wait to go..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhuh..." Ryuji stared at Momo, listening to her every word attentively.
@iKawaiiMomo "So...when does the festival start?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Well shit. Doesn't matter, we still make a cute couple~"
@iKawaiiMomo you."*
@iKawaiiMomo "Good. But just in case you don't wanna walk in that anymore I'll be there to carry you-
@iKawaiiMomo "It's a really long kimono, dear. You were gonna trip on it."
@iKawaiiMomo "Please do be careful in that though. You looked like you were about to fall just now." Ryuji gets up and walks over to Momo.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji sat up slightly, staring at Momo is complete awe. "*Whistle* Who's beautiful? Momo's beautiful."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alrighty." Ryuji then sat down at the couch, waiting for Momo.
@iKawaiiMomo kissu kissu.
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo in a Kimono, huh? Can't wait."
@iKawaiiMomo 
@iKawaiiMomo "Of course honey."
@iKawaiiMomo "Welp. Doesn't matter. I did promise you we'd go."
@iKawaiiMomo "Yep. Knew it. Today."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...Uhh...Momo, when was that festival you were telling me about?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh....hmm..." Ryuji tries to think of something.
@iKawaiiMomo "I dunno..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Whatever.." Kisses back.
@iKawaiiMomo "...Dammit." Frown.
@iKawaiiMomo "I love you more~"
"Hehe...I look so smart." 

//Shut up, Ryu... 
@iKawaiiMomo "I love you babe..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiled and held her chin, moving his lips to hers.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then yawned slightly. "Sorry I fell asleep last night hun. I was really tired..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji creeps up behind Momo, placing a kiss upon her cheek. "Hey babe..." He whispers in her ear.
@ExperimentWings //Mhmm. *Whistles*
@DreamInDeath_ "Hmm..." Ryuji then stops Alister, questioning if he had any fighting experience, and about the shadow.
@ExperimentWings @RoyalAsashin After Ryan and Inoichi had walked in, Ryuji would follow soon after.
@DreamInDeath_ "Yep. It's an...eccentric job."
@ExperimentWings @RoyalAsashin "It's cool Ry..." Ryuji hugged back, trying to avoid eye contact with Inoichi.
@DreamInDeath_ "Yep. I hunt treasure."
@DreamInDeath_ "What do ya mean? A guy can't take a stroll and relax at the park? Treasure hunting gets very tiring, yaknow."
@DreamInDeath_ "I always come to this park man."
@DreamInDeath_ "Er...I guess."
@ExperimentWings @RoyalAsashin As they grew closer, Ryuji smiled and greeted the two, somewhat intimidated by Inoichi's glare.
@DreamInDeath_ "You were here just yesterday."
@ExperimentWings @RoyalAsashin "Oh hey, Ry!"
@DreamInDeath_ "So, what exactly are you exploring?"
@ExperimentWings @RoyalAsashin "It's cold as hell outside man...where is Ryan.."
@DreamInDeath_ "Yup." He smiled lightly, still somewhat intrigued of the male.
@iKawaiiMomo Repeated kisses then started to be given at a very slow pace.
@DreamInDeath_ "Ehh, its cool. Alot of my friends are demons so it doesn't really bother me at all."
@iKawaiiMomo After that, Ryuji immediately got back to his sweet, passionate kiss session with Momo.
@DreamInDeath_ "So, you're a demon? What?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiles as he gazed back at her hues. "I love you so much, Momo~"
@DreamInDeath_ "Exploring?"
@RoyalAsashin @ExperimentWings "Where the hell is she...?" Ryuji is nonchalantly waiting for Ryan at the bakery. It's cookie time.
@iKawaiiMomo His hands slowly shifting to her waist.
@iKawaiiMomo "M-Mhmm~" Ryuji's arms snaked around Momo's waist.
@DreamInDeath_ Looks at chains, then shadow, then chains, then shadow. "Are you...sure?"
@DreamInDeath_ "Yea, Yea...what the hell are you doing with those things anyway?"
@iKawaiiMomo "mmm...!~" Ryuji's eyes widened but then started to close slowly, returning the kiss.
@DreamInDeath_ "I'm doing...alright." Totally isn't staring at the chains and shadow.
@iKawaiiMomo "What?~"
@DreamInDeath_ "Hmm?" Ryuji glanced at him, noticing that it was Momo's older brother, Alister--what the hell is he doing with chains.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hehe~"
@DreamInDeath_ -pressence.
@DreamInDeath_ Ryuji was taking one of those nonchalant walks through the lark he loved so much, headphones on and unaware of Alister's-
@iKawaiiMomo As he stopped, Ryuji smiled and gazed at the beautiful hicky he had placed onto his treasure's neck.
@iKawaiiMomo //Huh? What?
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //Don't mention it m9
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ //And er...I'm not good with starters, so you send one.
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ //I'm listening....:3
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //Er...sure.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //Yo.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo //wtf
@IronWallShield "Yea. They're cool people."
@IronWallShield "Alright, but this guy is kind of er...stern. I guess after that I can introduce you to Ryohei, or Momo..."
@IronWallShield "I could introduce ya to Yuki..."
@IronWallShield "Hmm...what to do first..."
@IronWallShield "Welp...just me and you, Toni. We're gonna go on so many adventures together, hehe~"
@GladiusIrae @IronWallShield "Yea, sure."
@IronWallShield @GladiusIrae "Yes you are. You're also MY shield. Hehe'
@IronWallShield @GladiusIrae - kinda heavy."
@IronWallShield @GladiusIrae Ryuji smiles sheepishly  as a small chuckle escapes his lips. "Hehe~" He then picked up the shield. "Woah...-
@GladiusIrae @IronWallShield "Ahh, so that's her name? I'll call her Toni."
@GladiusIrae After a long while filled with yelling, Ryuji finally made it back to the area where @IronWallShield resided. "Yo! Shield!"
@GladiusIrae "This is gonna be a looooong journey then." Sigh
@GladiusIrae "Ugh, don't you have a sheath or something!?"
@GladiusIrae "Ow, my ears! Shut up!"
@GladiusIrae "Heh. I know about your little sanity consumption skill."
@GladiusIrae - surge of power and bloodlust effectively. "Oh no ya dont..."
@GladiusIrae Knowing this would happen due to the shield's warning, Ryuji shrouded himself with his nen aura, blocking out the blade's-
@GladiusIrae "Uhh...did I say something funny?" Ryuji asked as he walked off with the blade.
@IronWallShield "I'll cya later, Shield." Ryuji waved as he started walking off in search for the blade. "Thanks for the heads up."
@GladiusIrae "Yea. The shield. She's looking for you."
@IronWallShield "Consumed...?"
@GladiusIrae "Oh? I hope they don't mind me borrowing you for a bit. I kinda want this shield, and to get the shield, i need the sword."
@IronWallShield "I-It's fine...I'll just go get the sword for ya."
@IronWallShield "Gah!" Ryuji quickly moved his hand away.
@GladiusIrae Ryuji then picked up the blade from the floor, observing it. "Woah, nice. I dunno why your weilder isnt weilding you right now"
@IronWallShield "I'll still look for it. Sit tight, you're gonna be mine soon." Ryuji smirked as he patted the shield.
@GladiusIrae "He isn't really doing a good job as a weilder. You're kind of in the middle of a cave."
@IronWallShield "Welp."
@GladiusIrae "Weilder? So you already have a weilder?"
@IronWallShield "Any idea where I can find the sword?"
@IronWallShield "Hmm...Yea. Definetely sounds familiar."
@IronWallShield "Uhh...you mind giving me any details about the sword? I may have heard of it somewhere..."
@IronWallShield "Sword..?"
@IronWallShield "Well, I was actually looking for you. I'm a treasure hunter."
@IronWallShield -searching for was a talking ancient shield.
@IronWallShield "...." Ryuji blinked as he stood in front of the shield. The treasure hunter had no idea that the ancient shield he was-
@IronWallShield "A talking...shield."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiled against her neck as he kept kissing and sucking, his warmth against hers.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's kisses were soon dragged down to her neck.
@iKawaiiMomo He returned her passion-filled kiss as he held her hands slightly tighter.
@iKawaiiMomo "R-Really what?" Ryuji smiles also as he takes a hold on them soft hands again.
@iKawaiiMomo Upon arriving, he gently placed her onto the bed as he was forced ontop due to her clinging.
@PurpleTatsumi //Are you serious nigga?
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then carried Momo to the bedroom, kissing her as he walked.
@PurpleTatsumi //I'm so fucking done nigga
@iKawaiiMomo "Don't worry. I won't worry."
@iKawaiiMomo "Good~" Ryuji smiles and pulls her in for a hug.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea...but don't worry about that..." Ryuji then would place his hands on Momo's hips and lean in for a kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea...my old man..."
@iKawaiiMomo "...Oh. Sounds like /him/..." Ryuji narrowed his eyes znd looks away.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Maybe we should leave em be now...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "I thought you were all alone and stuff..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea....you never told me you had a brother, by the way."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Yaknow, I really like Alice. Perfect match for Ryohei."
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh? He seems fine to me. RIN was a dweeb."
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "...Huh. Nice Momo. Ya scared away your onii-chan."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo "No no...just a little more~"
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "Well then."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Smirks. And. Nod.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "Momo...you're kinda holding too tight..."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Narrows eyes. "Yea, sure."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo Nomming on popcorn. "Want some babe?"
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "Ehehe..."
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "I love Momo too much to do that. That, and if I do you'd kick my ass."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "He's dead."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Welp. It was nice knowin ya, bro."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Totally didnt call her.
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "So that kind of explains the 'My Momo' thing, huh?"
@DreamInDeath_ @iKawaiiMomo "Oh, I see...kinda feel bad for kicking ya just now."
@PrinceBeatdown Looks at Ryohei like WTF "RYOHEI WHAT I'M YOUR BROTHER!"
"Is that...me? I look kinda hot." 
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "Hmm? Little sis?" Ryuji then let go of Momo and helped Alister up.
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ Ryuji returned the kiss, closing his eyes in the process.
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ Ryuji smirks and holds Momo's chin, pulling her in for a smooch. "/Mine./"
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "I win. Good game." Ryuji hugs Momo.
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "..." Casually kicks Alister in the shin. "Did that work?"
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "So what are the rules for this thing anyway?
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "...You're on. If I gotta prove that Momo's my precious treasure then so be it."
@iKawaiiMomo @DreamInDeath_ "Is this some kind of contest or somethin,?"
@DreamInDeath_ "A challenge?"
@DreamInDeath_ "Yea, good luck with that."
@DreamInDeath_ "...Huh. That's weird. I could've sworn Momo was /my/ treasure."
@DreamInDeath_ Ryuji's eyes then narrowed slightly. "/Your/ Momo?"
@DreamInDeath_ "What we've been up to...? A-Ain't a question like that kinda personal...?"
@DreamInDeath_ "Y-Yea. Nice to meet ya. Name's Ryuji, but you probably already knew that."
@DreamInDeath_ Ryuji turns around, facing the stranger. "Er...hey there."
@LostInMyEgo //Sounds painful man.
@iKawaiiMomo "Not anymore."
@iKawaiiMomo "Sure, why not?"
@iKawaiiMomo "I-It's fine..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe...Can't breathe..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji quickly kisses her back and smiles. "And I love you, Momo~"
@iKawaiiMomo "Well, okay I guess..."
@iKawaiiMomo "I see.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Practice?"
@iKawaiiMomo "I'm...I'm sure. I just hope that I am ready when you do wanna have kids with me."
@iKawaiiMomo "I'm fine baby."
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea..." Ryuji nods slowly as he stares at her.
@iKawaiiMomo "I...don't really know, actually."
@iKawaiiMomo "O-Oh..."
@iKawaiiMomo "So, uhh...babe. Are you really pregnant..?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh? No, I'm sorry..."
@iKawaiiMomo "I...I dunno...they say you can tell alot of what you're gonna be like from your parents..."
@iKawaiiMomo "B-Because...I was afraid that I might end up like my dad...." Ryuji's hues shifted downward as he said so.
@iKawaiiMomo "...Hm?" Ryuji looked at her in question.
@iKawaiiMomo "It's fine babe...I understand..." Ryuji returns the hug.
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo...I don't care if you keep crying. I'll always be here to comfort you and wipe those tears.."
@iKawaiiMomo "...Baby..." Ryuji then lifted her face as he shifted closer, wiping away every tear in sight.
@iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji stares at her for a breif moment before holding her cheek, looking at his treasure dead in the face.
@iKawaiiMomo "...I really am sorry hun..." Ryuji stares at her as she tends to his very minor cuts.
@iKawaiiMomo "But, Momo.--Are you even listening to me?" His words didn't get through to her at all as she dragged him inside.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "I-I'm fine...I'm also really sorry babe..."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma Ryuji then got up from the pavement, his hand over his nose. "Ow..."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma -awful lot like a certain blondie.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma "GAH!" Was what the two had heard outside of the house. It sounded like someone had fell. Someone who sounds an-
"...It's been like, a couple of days. No sign of her..."

//She's fine, Ryu.

"...Yea but I'm not."

//...
@DevilishBlack "...lets go."
@DevilishBlack "You ready?"
@DevilishBlack "Yea, well, I got nothing better to do.
@DevilishBlack "I didn't come to you about it. I came to you looking for missions."
@DevilishBlack "It's nothing serious, just some gir drama, i guess."
@DevilishBlack -was written all over the blonde's face.
@DevilishBlack Ryuji then opened the door slowly and walked in, greeting Yukio. "Sup, Yuki!" He said as he forced a smile. Sadness though, -
@DevilishBlack -being depressed and sad really wasn't Ryu's thing.
@DevilishBlack -he sighed as he then fixed his clothes. He didnt want to show the 'depressed Ryuji' to him, or anyone for that matter. -
@DevilishBlack Ryuji was depressed, bored, and broke. He decided it was time to go see an old friend. Upon knocking on his partner's door,-
Ryuji sits alone on his couch, depressed. He checks through his phone for any missions as he lets out a soft sigh.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "Guitar? Hey, i play too!"
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "Welp...wanna play cards or somethig Kentaro?"
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "Uhm...Oh shit." And then things got awkward.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings -out like his deadbeat, gambling, and drunkard father.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings -his hues. He was scared to death not only because his treasure could be pregnant, but that he could turn-
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "I...I dunno...I'm not even sure if I'll be a good father..." Ryuji looked down, his golden locks covering-
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings - that whole 'fat incident'? If so, then I'm not going over there.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings Ryuji walks over to Kentaro reluctantly, his cheek red from that pimpsmack. "Are you gonna hit me like -
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "Well gee, THANKS KENTARO!"
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "IThinkMomoIsPregnant...!" Ryuji said nervously.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "...guys please. Stop fucking for like 5 mins and hear me out. It's Ryuji time right now."
@pam_spraybot //uhh...no.
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "..." Door slams open. Ryuji stands there, breathing like a wild animal. Fear written all over his face.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "I...gotta go." Ryuji got up and started heading towards the bathroom.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Even he knew!?"
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "..." Ryuji got even more scared. This time, his fear was directed towards Alice.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown Those words didn't even help him one bit. He got even more worried. "I'm not ready man...I'm just not ready..."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -he had severe gambling problems. He kind of didn't want to be a father. Not yet, at least.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -to engulf him. He barely knew how to be a father. The only thing that comes to mind was his father, but-
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -about all those times they had sex. Unprotected sex at that. Ryu done fucked up. "Oh shit..." Worry began-
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Y-You're joking, right? Please tell me you're joking!" Ryuji's eyes widen as he looks away breifly, thinking-
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Wh-What...!?"
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Oh brother.." Ryuji fixates his eyes upon the TV, watching a movie.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji sighs and leans back into the couch, saddened that his treasure had left.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "I'll cya later babe..."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji then frowned as she said so. "Well, alright babe..."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Ehehe..." Ryuji looks away nervously and rubs the back of his head.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Yup. We cant throw two people who are madly in love out of wack~"
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Welp..." Awward stare.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma //i just noticed that huge derp
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Entertainment room?"
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Nothing much. Just work and stuff..." Ryuji sat down next to momo and coiled his arm around her.
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "...Okay then. That only makes me wanna worry more..."
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "what?"
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "...Huh?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma //SHHHHH
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Looks like you hit it off with my little brother, Alice."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Hmm..?" Ryuji caught up to Momo and immediately saw the hand holding. Instant smirk. "Oh~"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Not...really..." Ryuji gave a puzzled look as he got up and followed momo.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings Well shit.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai Is all dead. Aye.
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai Runs up on Kentaro out the cut and bops him with nen.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings Nope. He's already gone.
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "I called her pregnant!"
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai "Uh oh. It's the Samurai whistle."
@ExperimentWings "Oh shit..." Ryuji was just about ready to start hauling ass.
@ExperimentWings "N-No! I'm callin you pregnant!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Maybe he's helping her? I dunno..."
@ExperimentWings "Bloated? I guess i can see why."
@iKawaiiMomo "Sigh...yup. Still gone. He sure does love it over at Alice's place."
@iKawaiiMomo "What do you think I mean, baka. Just get in already."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey there honey. You're a little late." He narrowed his eyes slightly in a joking manner.
@iKawaiiMomo -thinking from time to time how quiet the place was without his little bro.
@iKawaiiMomo -he immediately figured it was Momo since she had said she was gonna drop by. He then would get up and goanswer the door,-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji was in his house, tv on, alone, bored. He decided to watch sone movies. Upon doing so, he heard a ring on his doorbell. -
@ExperimentWings "Sup?"
@ExperimentWings "Ryaaaaaaaaannnn"
@iKawaiiMomo "Don't worry about it. You didnt know, okay?" Ryuji's embrace grew slightly tighter.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji matched her pace perfectly and patted her head gently."i love you too, Momo."
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, you. Baka." Ryuji narrowed his eyes slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo "it's fine. She'd most likely tell me to go to you anyway. All i did was talk to her about you anyways.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Its fine Momo. I understand." Ryuji helped his treasure wipe her tears.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then tried his best to comfort her after hearing her sobs.
@iKawaiiMomo -on her shoulder.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea. You are. You're my adorable, sweet, and loving idiot." Ryuji then pulled her into a warm emvrace and buried his face -
@iKawaiiMomo - relief. He then looked at her hues. His own loojed somewhat saddened.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji quickly checked the night stand. Luckily, he had found an inhaler. He then used the inhaler on momo as he sighed in-
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo? Momo!" Ryuji quickly let go and looked around the room in search of an inhaler or something he could use.
@iKawaiiMomo -something like that to you babe...! My heart belongs to you and you only!"
@iKawaiiMomo -friend from school!" He exclaimed as he took a tight grip of the girl's collar and pulled her in closer. "I would NEVER do-
@iKawaiiMomo -something like that to you!? Do you not have any trust in me!? I told you id be by your side always, momo!  That was just a-
@iKawaiiMomo -attempt to calm her down, he started yelling back in retaliation. "The only idiot here is you! Do you honestly think id do-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji quickly held the girls chin and pulled her into a kiss, even if she liked it or not. After the kiss he had given in an -
@iKawaiiMomo -im cheating on her!? What the hell, does she not trust me or something!?' he thought to himself as she looked away.
@iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji's eyes narrowed as he. Frowned even more. Clearly he was upset from her words. 'Are you shitting me!? She thinks-
@iKawaiiMomo -had no thought or intention of cheating on Momo at all.
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo! Whats the matter? Please tell me...?" Ryuji was being dense as hell, completely oblivious of what was going on. He--
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji walked even closer, artempting to uncover her.
@iKawaiiMomo - Standing infront of her door and panting slightly, he called out to her. "Momo..."
@iKawaiiMomo Once Ryuji had reached inside the girl's house and closed the door behind him, he ventured to her room. Then, there he was. -
@iKawaiiMomo -chill slightly ran down his spine as the thought of losing her occured in his head.
@iKawaiiMomo -catch up to her. "S-Sorry, Nozomi, but i gotta go!" And then he was off. Dashing towards her as fast as he could. A cold-
@iKawaiiMomo do something. And fast. "Momo!" he cried out to her, but it was no use. "Damn!" he said as he was about to start running to-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji stumbled back, but kept his balance. He had completely no idea what she was talking about, but he did know he had to -
@iKawaiiMomo -spoke as his smile quickly changed into a frown.
@iKawaiiMomo -trickling down her face and to lower remove his hands from the back of his head. "Momo!? W-Why are you crying!?" The hunter -
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh?" The two stopped, looking at Momo. Ryuji's initial reaction was to widen his eyes slightly as he observed the tears-
@iKawaiiMomo -their old school days.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji kept walking with his hands behind his head, smiling sheepishly as they cracked jokes and talked about-
@iKawaiiMomo The only thing she saw was Ryuji and the 'mysterious' girl chatting it up and laughing. He seemed to be having alot of fun.
@iKawaiiMomo -school, when they first met. And two, he had no idea his girlfriend, Momo, was already at the park, taking a stroll herself.
@iKawaiiMomo -walking and talking with the girl. One, he was completely oblivious that Nozomi had a secret crush on him ever since middle-
@iKawaiiMomo -trait was her long, smooth, jet black hair which reached down to her back. Ryuji was completely ignorant of two things when-
@iKawaiiMomo -an old friend of his back from school, Nozomi. Nozomi wasnt a very outgoing and popular girl at school. Her most noticeable-
@iKawaiiMomo It was a nice, sunny day when Ryuji decided to take one of his usual strolls through the park. Fortunately, Ryuji had ran into-
@iKawaiiMomo A bright smile was given back as the hunter's warm embrace grew warmer.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright. It's a promise."
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh, you better." Cue the cute cuddle scene.
@iKawaiiMomo "That's a stupid question. Of course I'm gonna stay by your side hun~"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiled into the kiss as he wrapped his arms around her frame.
@iKawaiiMomo "Cmere~" Ryuji's hand then gently holds momo's chin, leaning in for an intimate kiss.
@FallenCresent "Well damn. Movies?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm? You don't like flirty?" He smiled brightly, staring into the girl's hues.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup." Ryuji leaned against the balcony, facing her and gave a thumbs up.
@FallenCresent "Hmm...ever tried going to an amusent park or something?"
@iKawaiiMomo - He was fixated on momo's alluring frame.
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm. You look perfect.~" Ryuji responded as he stared at the blonde, not paying the sky any form of attention whatsoever.-
@FallenCresent "I see...well, what do you find...not boring? Anything in particular you find interest in?"
@HolyDigimon "Hehehe...but you look really cute with them off."
@HolyDigimon "Er...no problem."
@HolyDigimon Ryuji's eyes widened in awe as he saw the Angel. "W-WOAH! CUTE!"
@HolyDigimon "Take it off. I wanna see your pretty faceeee~"
@HolyDigimon "...." Ryuji then tried taking it off.
@HolyDigimon Ryuji stares back, feeling kind of awkward because of the headpiece. "Hey, uhh...Angel. Do you always wear that headpiece?"
@HolyDigimon "Alright. No more pokemon jokes. Not unless they're needed."
@HolyDigimon "Fine, fine...geez."
@HolyDigimon "So, wanna go do some friend stuff? Yaknow, wander around the region and collect Gym Badges, try to become a champion..."
@HolyDigimon "Yep. Friends." Cue the pokeball-free handshake.
@HolyDigimon "Friends sounds good enough to me."
@HolyDigimon "Oh, cmon. I'm not that bad of a partner."
@HolyDigimon "Shhh...No need to yell so loud, my pokemon partner..."
@HolyDigimon "Instead, I'll make ya my pokemon partner!~"
@HolyDigimon "I'm sorry. I wont try to catch ya anymore..."
@HolyDigimon "I-I see."
@HolyDigimon "Why not?"
@HolyDigimon "Are to!"
@HolyDigimon "Why not!? And dont say its because you're not a pokemon, because you are!"
@HolyDigimon "Aww, cmon! Just stay caught already!"
@HolyDigimon "Pokeballs..are...Pokebals!" Ryuji then chucked a bunch of them at the angel.
@HolyDigimon -thrown shortly after.
@HolyDigimon "Oh no! You aren't gonna trick me! Just you being in the pokeball is proof that you're a pokemon!" Another pokeball gets-
@HolyDigimon "Dammit, I was so close!"
@HolyDigimon -free hand towards the angel, attempting to catch her. "Tricked ya! Now you're all mine!~"
@HolyDigimon "Heh..." He chuckled lightly as he swiftly whipped out a pokeball from his pocket. The pockeball then got chucked with his-
@HolyDigimon -nervous. He then offered a handshake to the digital monster. "The Name's Ryuji, by the way."
@HolyDigimon "N-Nothing, ahaha..." He then gently rubbed the back of his head. It was a habit of his every time he felt embarrassed or -
@HailDaKing @ExperimentWings //Tip. I mean Tip. ^^''
@HailDaKing @ExperimentWings //EHHHH, Just kiddin. I forget to pay the pizza guys all the time.
@ExperimentWings @HailDaKing //*Gasp* You didnt tip!? YOU MONSTER!
@HolyDigimon "O-Oh..."
@HolyDigimon "I see...Are those like, anime or something? You seem like a cosplayer..."
@HolyDigimon "What the hell's a pokemon? And you look like a regular human to me..."
@ExperimentWings "Well, thanks for the heads up, Ry."
@ExperimentWings "Uhh...No thanks. Overboard is uhh...bad. Very bad."
@ExperimentWings "Uhuh..." Taking notes in head.
@ExperimentWings "S-So uhh...what exactly do I need to do to be more...protective..?"
@ExperimentWings "Well, alright. I'll try to be more protective..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh..~"
@iKawaiiMomo - as soon as his hues laid eyes on her. A gulp was followed and the words: "Me, You, Bedroom, Now."
@iKawaiiMomo - he noticed that her clothes only consisted of one of his shirts. "Oh...God." A huge, visible blush then appeared on his face-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji opened the door and walked in. Upon closing the door and arriving into the living room, he saw Momo. His eyes widened as-
@iKawaiiMomo Cue the doorbell ring.
@iKawaiiMomo - But also, he was kind of excited for the 'surprise' she had for him.
@iKawaiiMomo Around 1-2 hours later, Ryuji had returned from his hunting job, smiling as he was satisfied of the huge reward he had gotten.-
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright hun. I'll be back in no time~" He then would slowly let her go and start walking off, humming a tune.
@iKawaiiMomo "A surprise? I cant wait hun.~" He then kissed her passionately, savoring every second before he had to go.
@ExperimentWings "Protective, huh...?"
@iKawaiiMomo -shifted her face to meet his again. As his hues peered into hers, a smile then appeared on his face as he inched closer.
@iKawaiiMomo "Well, alright. Work is usually boring anyways...So, what are you gonna do while I'm out babe?" He gently held her chin and -
@iKawaiiMomo "You can come with me if you want." He said before he had kissed her back once again.
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea...But this mission is really close by. I should be back in no time..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ack! Momo--!" His eyes widened by her sudden action, but he slowly wrapped his arms around her waist and returned her kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji answered the door. It seemed like he was about to head out to his hunting job. "Hmm..?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea...Cya later.." He sulks as he relaxes on the couch, watching TV.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji heads to the living room to relax as his treasure was heading out.
@iKawaiiMomo He then closed his eyes and let out a loud sigh. "Alright, babe..."
@iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji stared at her, still worrying.
@iKawaiiMomo "Are...Are you sure Momo..? It really doesnt seem like it."
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo...you alright in there...?" Ryuji stood behind the door, worrying a little.
#Persona #Persona5 #pixiv 
@ExperimentWings "Momo? Of course I do."
@OneColdBiatch Ryuji then also headed off in another direction. He wondered how his brother was doing back at the house.
@ExperimentWings "Ehh...Alright, I guess..."
@iKawaiiMomo "...Momo..?" Ryuji noticed her rush to the bathroom, deciding to investigate slightly.
@OneColdBiatch "I-I know you're tough but still...Ahh screw it." Ryuji stops insisting and just lets her go before letting out a loud sigh.
@iKawaiiMomo "...Uhuh." Ryuji walks to the living room, losing intrest completely.
@FallenCresent "Boring, huh..?" Ryuji then wondered if he was 'boring' as she said that. "I thought you'd say something like...annoying?"
@ExperimentWings "Well, shit. Ryohei seems like a much better lover than me.."
@puppy_bolt Ryuji tried his best to hold back the urge to want the pup.
@OneColdBiatch -you home?" He said as he stared into her hues.
@OneColdBiatch Ryuji gets up and brushes himself off before taking his coat, looking at her with slight concern. "Alright...Want me to take-
@OneColdBiatch "Ehehe...It's fine. I kinda fell asleep also.." He rubbed the back of his head and smiled awkwardly.
@OneColdBiatch -half awake anyway, and Ryjuji was also starting to feel uncomfortable.
@OneColdBiatch "Hey, Autumn...you awake?" He said as he saw her move against him. He didn't want to bother her too much but she was-
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh..? Check what?" Ryuji looked over at Momo in confusion.
@OneColdBiatch -waking her up then conjured in his head, not knowing what to do.
@OneColdBiatch -storm was completely gone. His golden hues then shifted downward at the girl that was laying in his arms. The thought of-
@OneColdBiatch Upon opening his eyes, he had slowly realized he had fell asleep also. "H-Huh...?" He looked up at the clear blue sky. The-
@OneColdBiatch As they sat there, the rain started settling down over a long period of time.
@OneColdBiatch -uncomfortable, dont worry about that."
@OneColdBiatch He then snakes his arms around the orange haired girl's body, pulling her into a warm embrace. "Y-You dont make me -
@OneColdBiatch - hues elsewhere.
@OneColdBiatch "Alright, Alright. So does this mean I have to uhh...Get closer or something?" Ryuji said reluctantly as  he shifted his-
@AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Cya lates, Alice. And uhh...Ryohei."
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "You're stupid, Ryohei. How could Momo be in love with you if she's head over heels for me?"
@OneColdBiatch "It's cool...I said I was fine anyway..." He also looked away as they were leaning against each other slightly.
@OneColdBiatch "Alrighty." Ryuji sat next to her with his hands in his pockets, finally getting hit with the cold breeze.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown -Alice and Momo, questioning them slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji returned from the kitchen after putting the bags away. "Hmm?" he said as he looked over at-
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown -walked back to the kitchen to put the bags away.
@iKawaiiMomo @AliceAkuma @PrinceBeatdown "Oh, uhh..Yea. Ryohei went shopping for me. Sorry I didn't tell you earlier hun." Ryuji then-
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Songs? Concerts? What?"
@KawaiiKiyoChan Ryuji smiled as he got up and handed her the books. "It's the least I could do for making you fall like that. Ehehe.."
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown - call me earlier...?"
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown After finishing, Ryuji headed back to the place where everyone else was at. "Hmm..? Did someone-
@KawaiiKiyoChan Ryuji then knelt down to pick up the books with her.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -an appropriate place to store them in after sorting them out.
@AliceAkuma @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji was completely oblivious to the situation, humming a tune as he placed the groceries in-
@KawaiiKiyoChan "Phew...good." Ryuji sighed in relief as he rubbed the back of his head. 
@puppy_bolt Ryuji then snuck his hand through the cage, petting the pup gently.
@KawaiiKiyoChan -gently helped her up from the floor. "Y-You aren't hurt anywhere, are you? Oh jeez..."
@KawaiiKiyoChan -where he was going. He just hoped she didn't lash out at him or anything. "Holy crap! I'm so sorry!" He exclaimed as he-
@KawaiiKiyoChan "Huh..?" Ryuji had just realized he had bumped into the female as a big wave of guilt had hit him. If only he was looking-
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma - he walked towards the kitchen with them.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "Don't stress yourself, Alice. Here, I got ya..." Ryuji then took the bags from her hands, letting her rest as-
@OneColdBiatch "You feeling better now, Autumn?" He fixed the jacket around her and placed his hands in his pockets shortly after.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -creating a bigger passageway into the house.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma  "Ahh, nice to meet ya Alice. I'm Ryuji. Come on in, you two." Ryuji then opened the door more for them, -
@Destroy_mets_ "O-Oh...Ehehe..." He took a sip of the drink after chuckling awkwardly.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma - 'Pretty cute.' he thought to himself as he stared at her for a while, but then looked back at Ryohei.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma "It's cool. And who's the girl? She your girlfriend or somethin'?' Ryuji's golden hues shifted towards Alice.-
@Destroy_mets_ "Yea...I guess you're right."
@puppy_bolt He then would walk towards the pup's cage, kneeling down as he looked at the pup and smiled.
@ExperimentWings "Huh? But doesn't it get a bit annoying over time?"
@OneColdBiatch "Ehehe...I'll be fine. Don't worry about me." He smiled as he insisted on giving her the jacket.
@Destroy_mets_ "Thanks, by the way. And It's not that I dont like em, it's that I always end up on some weird adventure with em."
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma -as he rubbed his head lazily, running his fingers through his blond locks.
@PrinceBeatdown @AliceAkuma Ryuji then opened the door, expecting his brother to come back with the groceries. "Yo...You're back." he said-
@Destroy_mets_ "Oh, uhh...my bad. Haha.." Ryuji then rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment.
@Destroy_mets_ //Er...Sure.
@puppy_bolt "...He's...so adorable..." Ryuji then walked into the pet shop, searching for the pup.
@OneColdBiatch -her.
@OneColdBiatch "I dunno if this'll help, but you can have my jacket if that helps." He then started to take off his jacket, handing it to-
@Destroy_mets_ //Well shit. I'm an idiot.
@ExperimentWings "Yea, but he's like that to pretty much anyone."
@puppy_bolt Ryuji walked closer, his hues still fixated on the pup.
@Destroy_mets_ "Hmm?" Ryuji looked up at the mysterious person that had approached him.
@OneColdBiatch "Hey, you alright?" The cold was hitting him too, but he wasn't that affected by it. "You cold or somethin'?"
@ExperimentWings "He hates that kind of stuff too. And not to mention he's always so damn worried and protective all the time..."
@puppy_bolt - too adorable.
@puppy_bolt Ryuji's eyes shifted towards the puppy. He knew something was staring at him. "...." Ryuji couldn't stop staring, the pup was-
#OpenRP -as he walked down his neighborhood. heading to the park. He was bored and had nothing to do.
#OpenRP "Angels...Demons...Demon hunters..Bounty hunters...Geez, why can't I ever run into a normal person for once...?" Ryuji muttered-
@OneColdBiatch As he predicted, his plan was a complete failure. "Damn..." He muttered as he hung up.
@OneColdBiatch -completely doubted this plan would work, but he decided to give it a shot.
@OneColdBiatch "A cab? You sure a cab will come out here in this storm...?" He gave a puzzled look as he started to take out his phone. He-
@OneColdBiatch -seemingly he was out of luck. He had no words to really say. He thought if he brought up her ex, she'd be sad again.
@OneColdBiatch After they shook hands, Ryuji tried to find ways to start a normal conversation with the girl. "Uhh..." He looked down,-
@OneColdBiatch "It's no problem, Autumn. The name's Ryuji." He held out his hand to her, offering a handshake.
@OneColdBiatch -his mistakes." He gave a reassuring smile as he continued to try and uplift the girl's feelings.
@OneColdBiatch - Who the hell falls out of love with such a pretty girl like you anyway? If anything, he's the one who's gonna learn from-
@OneColdBiatch "Hey, Hey..." He gently patted Autumn's shoulder. "Cheer up, man. You dont need an asshole like him in your life anyway.-
@ExperimentWings "Wow. Sounds a lot like...Ryohei."
@OneColdBiatch -any more worse, huh?" He said as his hues shifted over towards the girl.
@OneColdBiatch Ryuji then took a seat next to Autumn, looking outside and observing the weather in absolute disgust. "Things couldn't get-
@Lonely_Alex_ //Oh. Well shit. *Plays Void*
@iKawaiiMomo "Sorry. Cant help it." He continued staring at the pictures as the tissue became stained with red slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo "I...I see..." Blood oozing out again.
@FallenCresent -nothing about her, but I guess that was what intrigued him more. He wanted to know all about her.
@FallenCresent "Ouch. Why do you hate humans anyways...?" Ryuji tilted his head and stared at the woman in confusion. He knew absolutely-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji stares at the photo of him, then looks up at Momo. "..When did you even....take this?"
@ExperimentWings Ryuji kept reassuring her that he was fine everytime she asked. "Geez, Ry. I told you I'm fine like fifteen times now!"
@iKawaiiMomo "YES! YOU SHOULD! YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Er...Maybe~"
@iKawaiiMomo "NO! PLEASE!" Ryuji quickly springs back up.
@iKawaiiMomo "S-Sorry...Momo--..." Aaaaand he's gone.
@iKawaiiMomo -out of his nose. Good game.
@iKawaiiMomo Hah, She thought he was exaggerating? Ryuji then fell back, losing his conciousness from the ungodly amount of blood oozing-
@iKawaiiMomo "If I die from blood loss right now...I'll have zero regrets."
@iKawaiiMomo "Holy...shit..." Blood gushing out nose. Thumbs up.
@FallenCresent A faint smile curved upon his lips. "I'll take that as a compliment. Name's Ryuji Minakata."
@ExperimentWings "I told ya it's cool, Ry." Ryuji tried his hardest not to blush but that very weak tint of pink was still there.
@FallenCresent "You called me a human, you have this weird aura ruminating from you, and you're kinda forcing that smile there man."
@ExperimentWings "It's cool. People snap at me a lot." Ryuji whistled slightly as he looked down, clearly hiding his frown.
@FallenCresent "Well, yea. I'm human. But it seems like you aren't."
@ExperimentWings -seemed kind of off to him. He felt as though he was annoying her slightly.
@ExperimentWings "Y-Yea..." Ryuji felt slightly uncomfortable after that statement. He knew she was just upset but...That statement-
@FallenCresent "There's something about you that just...seems off in my opinion. You referred to me as 'human'. What do you mean by that?"
@ExperimentWings "O-Oh...I see. Aren't you a month pregnant now or something?"
@FallenCresent -seemed kind of like she was showing some hostility towards him. "Sorry to bother you, but do you mind talking for a bit?"
@FallenCresent "H-Hey there..." He said nervously, feeling slightly intimidated by her. She didn't seem very...friendly. in fact, she -
@ExperimentWings "Oh...Something wrong?"
@FallenCresent -was some ordinary girl at his point. 'Why'd she refer to me as human...?' He thought as He gently tapped her shoulder.
@FallenCresent "U-Uhm..."  somewhat intrigued, Ryuji decided to approach the female once  more. At this point, he wasn't even sure if she-
@ExperimentWings "Yee. That's definitely possible."
@ExperimentWings "Tired? You mean sleep tired or frustrated tired?"
@iKawaiiMomo Wink
@ExperimentWings @HailDaKing //....
@ExperimentWings "Eyyyy, Ryan! How's everyone's favorite Angel?"
#SeductiveSunday @iKawaiiMomo 
@iKawaiiMomo innocent smile.
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh,  'get it'"
@iKawaiiMomo "W-What?~"
@iKawaiiMomo Cue the seductive cat call.
@OneColdBiatch Ryuji's eyes wandered elsewhere, trying to think of a way to cheer her up.
@OneColdBiatch "Hmm...N-Not real--wait a minute...there is someone, actually..I dunno if he's around though..."
@OneColdBiatch "Fell out of love, huh? What an asshole..."
@iKawaiiMomo //ALREADY ON IT! *drags momo and Ryuji to DMs* 

"Huh!? What the--!"
@OneColdBiatch "Oh jeez. That blows...I remember last time I got dumped. Worst experience in my life." He said as he sympathized with her.
@OneColdBiatch -in the slightest.
@OneColdBiatch "Yaknow, if you're gonna lie, at least make your smile and laugh believable.." The hunter's eyes narrowed, not believing her-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji kept his onslaught of kisses and sucks upon her neck as he slowly crept his hands up her shirt.
@OneColdBiatch "You sure? Seemed like you were crying just now?" He stared at her, raising his eyebrows as he gave a puzzled look.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's kisses grew relentless as he placed his lips upon her cheek, slowly making their way to her neck.
@OneColdBiatch -wrong?" He went straight to the point with her, not wanting to talk about this horrible weather.
@OneColdBiatch - fearing getting completely ignored. He mustered up all of his courage and moved towards her a bit more. "Hey...Something-
@OneColdBiatch Noticing the deep sadness shown in her hues, Ryuji frowned. He thought for a short while if he should approach her, somewhat-
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh, cute~" he said softly as his grope intensified.
@OneColdBiatch -her as he was trying to think of a way to dry himself off.
@OneColdBiatch -anyway. He really needed the money. After a short while, he noticed the woman's presence. His golden hues shifted over at -
@OneColdBiatch -of the water from his dripping wet face. He knew from the weather report that it was going to be raining, but he went out -
@OneColdBiatch -would soon approach was even there. "Oh god..why'd I have to go hunting today...?" He muttered to himself as he wiped some-
@OneColdBiatch During the rainstorm, Ryuji quickly darted towards a shelter by a shop, not noticing the depressed, Orange-haired female he -
@OneColdBiatch //Its cool, and I was planning to reply to that 1st one anyway.
@iKawaiiMomo -crimson red blush gradually grow on her face over time.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji continued his constant groping as their tongues locked. A faint smirk formed on the hunter's lips as he saw the -
@OneColdBiatch //That would be nice. I suck with starters.
@OneColdBiatch //Well Uhh...Anything I could do to help? I could RP with ya or something.
@iKawaiiMomo - vigorously, trying to get a moan or two out of her.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's hands wandered around as their tongues danced, eventually stopping at momo's chest. He then groped her breasts -
@OneColdBiatch //XD Thanks for the heads up
@OneColdBiatch //Oh shit. You got any idea who did it?
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's tongue then ventured inside of her mouth in an attempt to meet hers.
@OneColdBiatch //You got hacked? That really sucks..
@FallenCresent -offering to help her up.
@FallenCresent -the woman and started panicking slightly. "Oh Crap! I-I'm so sorry!" He exclaimed as he held out a hand to the woman,  -
@FallenCresent Ryuji, a blond-haired treasure hunter, had bumped into the mysterious person accidentally. Upon impact, he looked down at-
@iKawaiiMomo -correlation with hers.
@iKawaiiMomo He gently forced himself onto her, pinning her down onto the couch as he slowly crawled ontop. His lips were moving in -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji slowly sat up, kissing his treasure passionately.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smirked. "I know what we could do...~"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...what to do..."
@iKawaiiMomo "I ain't that tired.."
@Lonely_Alex_  //That's NA, right?
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh? I just woke up from a nap baby .."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then would rub her thigh and move his golden hues towards her Azure ones.
@iKawaiiMomo -through his blond locks. "Mhmm. I missed you a whole lot."
@iKawaiiMomo His smile then grew brighter as she ha said that. He then would gently place a kiss upon her thigh as she ran her fingers -
@iKawaiiMomo "Hes out running an errand for me. And I dunno. This place has been really quiet and lonely lately"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji let out a loud sigh, laying back on the couch.
@iKawaiiMomo "I-I was..." He then walked over to his living room, sitting on the couch as he placed his face in his palms.
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh, uhh...nothing really. I'm just really exhausted from work..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then smiled weakly as he returned her warm embrace. "I'm glad to hear that babe..."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's house door opened slightly more as she did so. "Back from family stuff or whatever...?" He said as he rubbed his eyes.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey, baby. What's up?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey...momo..?" Can be heard, followed by a yawn as Ryuji walked outside the room.
@iKawaiiMomo As Ryuji smelled the wonderful breakfast Momo had made for him, he slowly got up and rubbed his eyes. "mmm..."
@iKawaiiMomo He kept sleeping as she walked away, burying his face in a pillow.

@iKawaiiMomo -his treasure was all that was on his mind, even in his dreams.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji laid there, sound asleep. "Mmm...Momo.." Was what had quietly escaped his mouth as he slept happily. It seemed as though-
@iKawaiiMomo His eyes then slowly fell shut after, growing tired.
@iKawaiiMomo "Y- Yea..." Ryuji chuckled lightly and moved closer, wrapping his arms around momo.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji had gotten off of the beauty and then would lay next to her. "*Yawn* I dunno what I'm gonna do tomorrow..."
@FallenCresent //It's cool, take your time.
@iKawaiiMomo believe* //wtf autocorrect
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright, I'll be live you...for now~"
@FallenCresent //You mind sending a starter then? I'm horrible with them.
@FallenCresent //Still need someone to RP with?
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhuh..." He narrowed his eyes, not believing her.
@iKawaiiMomo "So...what's up with that weird stare?"
@iKawaiiMomo "W-What...?" His smirk disappeared as he got filled with confusion. "Something on my face bae?"
@iKawaiiMomo "You tired already?~ and what's wrong with messing around baka?" He smirks as he looks down at her.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, don't. Hehe..."
@TyrantAzrael -activated his nen, alerting anyone that was nearby that he was there, and he wasn't a NORMAL human.
@TyrantAzrael -, Azrael, was lurking around the area in search of prey. "Time to start digging!" He said, smiling cheerfully and-
@TyrantAzrael -in enthusiasm to himself as he walked in. He was completely unaware and oblivious to the fact that the 'Mad Dog of Ikaruga'-
@TyrantAzrael -ungodly amount of treasure here and immediately grew interested. "Hehe~ I can see the treasure already!~" he shouted-
@TyrantAzrael Ryuji Munakata, a blond-haired treasure hunter, began walking inside an unfamiliar colosseum. He had heard they had an -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then slapped momo's tongue with his own. "Mh-hah!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Shut up! I already told you the adorable one in this relationship is you, baka!" He sticked out his tongue and teased her.
@iKawaiiMomo "Don't blush, Ryu. Don't blush, Ryu..." Aaaand cue the blush. "Dammit!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Lucky that your bae loves you less that you love him?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Dammit! Y-You win baby.." His lips then soon formed a small from as he fixated himself towards the blond beauty.
@DevilishBlack "Tch...pull some shit like that again, and I'll put you in another coma Yukio. I fucking swear."
@iKawaiiMomo "ILoveYouMore."
@iKawaiiMomo "I love you so much, momo..."
@iKawaiiMomo "You dork..." He muttered as he leaned in for another smooch.
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh? I ain't lyin baka!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Haha, don't worry about it babe. I love it when you blush like that~"
@iKawaiiMomo "What's wrong? That's a new shade of pink babe.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Sure did hun." He smiled at her wink and gave a quick peck on her lips.
@iKawaiiMomo He smiled as he started another staring session with her.
@iKawaiiMomo His tongue then coils around hers as he kissed her in between the swirls.
@iKawaiiMomo -his tongue to work.
@iKawaiiMomo Several kisses then followed after that. As his hands were pressed down on her hands, holding her hands, he decided to put-
@iKawaiiMomo "Not...yet~" Ryuji said as he moved closer and deepened the kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo -was in heaven or something.
@iKawaiiMomo A smile quickly formed on Ryu's lips as their lips gently pressed against each other. Every time they kissed, it was like he -
@iKawaiiMomo -his bae, staring into her sky blue hues.
@iKawaiiMomo "You should, if you don't want to sleep by yourself that is." He gave a smirk of his own as he shifted slightly closer towards-
@iKawaiiMomo "You liar...now you owe me a nice, long kiss."
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh shit. Looks like I have some competition..."
@RyukoLaSenketsu -//tell me you're gonna do that.
@RyukoLaSenketsu //Whats wrong? Don't wanna reply to me anymore? You gonna text him about how much you've been a baaaad girlfriend? Please-
@DevilishBlack "Because you keep getting hurt! Aren't you supposed to be my partner!?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then crawled on the bed, laying down next to her.
@RyukoLaSenketsu -//constantly ignores him. I think I'm gonna make it my buisness at this point.
@RyukoLaSenketsu //Do you have any idea how much my best friend complains to me that some bitch that's SUPPOSED to be his girlfriend,-
@RyukoLaSenketsu //And I think you need to talk to your boyfriend before he leaves your ass. Right now.
@RyukoLaSenketsu //Oh, thanks. You didn't ignore me. I thought by now you'd do the same to me of what you've been doing to him.
@RyukoLaSenketsu //So. You're the person who's dating my nigga Malique, huh?
@RyukoLaSenketsu //Hey. How's it going?
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then quickly got up as Momo dragged him. "Okay, Okay!"
@DevilishBlack "Stop overusing it, you idiot!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Er...How about we both sleep together?"
@DevilishBlack "A coma...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "N-No reason...I just thought you were gonna be stubborn about it."
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh? You're actually going along with it?"
@DevilishBlack "What do you mean, idiot!? I havent seen you in AGES. How's it been?"
@iKawaiiMomo "No way. You goto sleep first baka."
@DevilishBlack -heard from him in a long time. That...and he's about to ask him to go on a mission.
@DevilishBlack "YUKI!" Ryuji said as he called out towards the male, smiling happily. He felt a bit nostalgic because he hasn't seen or -
@ExperimentWings "Not really. Just been on alot of dates and missions is all."
@ExperimentWings "Besides those cookies you made Sawada send the other day, nothing really."
@ExperimentWings -completely bored out of his mind. He started thinking about how his brother, Ryohei, and Momo was doing.
@ExperimentWings Aaaand here comes another waiting session. Ryuji sat down, holding his head up with one of his hands as he sat there, -
@iKawaiiMomo "Ehehe...Alright babe."
@iKawaiiMomo "I uhh...I wish you luck? That is unless you want me to come.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Family, huh...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh...? Sup?"
@ExperimentWings "Ohhhh....I knew that."
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh...?"
@ExperimentWings "A nia what now?
@iKawaiiMomo "What about you...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Maybe...depends if any missions are open."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji didn't hesitate in the slightest to return that kiss .
@ExperimentWings "Uhh..." Awkward stare at the menu.
@ExperimentWings "OhThankGos."
@iKawaiiMomo "...*sigh*"
@iKawaiiMomo "Only if you're into me being like this~" He replied, chuckling softly.
@ExperimentWings "Ow...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "You see, now writer-chan is laughing at your ass now."

//...so.
@ExperimentWings -said patiently !
@ExperimentWings "I'm not..." He took a seat and waited PATIENTLY for the waiter. "...where the hell is the waiter!?" Dammit, I -
@iKawaiiMomo "Boo thang? Really dude?"

//Stfu. It works.

"...why are you my writer....?
@iKawaiiMomo As he felt her soft lips press against his, The blond then would tangle his arms around his boo thang's waist.
@ExperimentWings "Am not..." He gently pushed in the chair then went to his own.
@ExperimentWings As they reached to the table, he then pulled out the chair for her.
@iKawaiiMomo "You idiot. How am I gonna kiss ya when you're laying down." He said as he eventually puckered his back at her.
@ExperimentWings "Ugh, stop acting like such a kid.." He muttered as they walked over to a free table.
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm~" he said as he gently stroked her hair.
@iKawaiiMomo "I don't mind being a dork as long as I'm your dork, babe."
@ExperimentWings "Finally..."
@ExperimentWings "I can't live when you're tugging on my ear like this! Ow!"
@iKawaiiMomo "mmmm" (baka....)
@iKawaiiMomo "m- mm mmmmm" (I'm sorry)
@iKawaiiMomo them* Writer-kun is stupid.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's eyes shifted towards momo's, smiling as he grew lost in then.
@ExperimentWings "Hey, hey!"
@ExperimentWings "Ehehe..." Ryuji then opened the door for her.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...we could make out or something." He said with a perverted smile.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, me either."
@ExperimentWings "We were walking this whole time. You seriously didn't notice?"
@iKawaiiMomo "So, what're we gonna do, Mrs.?"
@ExperimentWings "Dude, we're here already."
@ExperimentWings "Uhh..yea."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ahh quit complaining. You know you wanna spend the night with me...again."
@ExperimentWings "Huh...?"
@ExperimentWings "Uhuh..." Is totally taking notes in his head.
@iKawaiiMomo "Well, that's where you come in, baka." He said, taking a seat next to his bae.
@ExperimentWings "It's romantic to be overprotective...?"
@ExperimentWings "Yea. REALLY careful..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Nope, I don't care. Gonna stay up."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ugh...fine. I'll stay up the whole night to prove you wrong!"
@ExperimentWings "Yea but...the chances for that is very slim.."
@ExperimentWings "It's not like angels would come out the cut and try to kill you...again."
@iKawaiiMomo He put his coat on the rack shortly after. "I can stay awake...I think."
@ExperimentWings "Something like what?"
@ExperimentWings "Hmm? Really? Kentaro didn't take you out or anything?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Wh-Wha!? No I ain't!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhuh...anyway we're here."
@ExperimentWings "Alrighty." Ryuji then began walking.
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh? What's that supposed to mean you moron?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm? Ryohei? I called him before we left."
@iKawaiiMomo He then yawned slightly. "Ugh...tired."
@iKawaiiMomo "You do that." He said as he held her hand and continued walking.
@iKawaiiMomo "I was joking, baka. You aren't Mrs.Minakata....not yet at least."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ow. The hell was that for, Mrs. Minakata?" He said as he held his nose and smiled.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji and Momo's kiss then ended as he broke the kiss slowly and smiles.
@iKawaiiMomo Upon entry, his tongue then had met hers. He then would slowly swirl his tongue around hers as he rubbed her hips.
@ExperimentWings "Let's just get going..."
@iKawaiiMomo His tongue then left his mouth and traced her lips as if asking for permission to enter.
@iKawaiiMomo The hunter then tilted his head slightly to the right, deepening the kiss further.
@iKawaiiMomo "You know you love me..." He said quietly in between the kiss as he snaked his arms around her waist.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then kissed her lips passionately as he held her close before spouting the words "Shuddap and kiss me already.."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then stopped and held momo's chin gently as he moved her face slowly to his.
@iKawaiiMomo -by her words. "That was WAY better than anything I said...I-I don't...know what to do..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ehehe...well then..." A crimson red blush then appeared onto Ryuji's face as he looked at his girlfriend, somewhat surprised -
@iKawaiiMomo "Remember when you asked me about what I thought of you? Well uhh..what did you think of me when we first met...?"
@iKawaiiMomo As they were walking home, Ryuji held her hand and interlocked their fingers. "So uhh...babe.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea...sorry." He then would chuckle nervously and look away.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, I had fun..." He said as he smiled and rubbed the back of his head.
@ExperimentWings "I-Im sorry. Let's just get going.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright babe..." He then began to skate off of the ice with momo.
@ExperimentWings "N-No! I meant that the baby is growing really fast!"
@ExperimentWings "Only..one? Huh?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Fine, fine. I do like carrying you though."
@ExperimentWings "Yea....how many months are you...?" Stareeeeeeeeee
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea. Do you want me to carry you back home also?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Ehehehe...Naicu!~" thumbs up as he nosebleeds.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hehe...all done!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hold on babe...I got you." He then starts brushing off the ice shavings off of her back.
#SeductiveSunday @iKawaiiMomo 
@ExperimentWings "Why so surprised? You knew I would come here.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ehehe...well, look on the bright side. You won."
@ExperimentWings At 6, Ryuji was at Ryan's house, ringing the doorbell as he waited.
@ExperimentWings [Alrighty.]
@ExperimentWings [Y-Yea, I'm sorry.]
@ExperimentWings [Alright Alright, geez.]
@ExperimentWings [Okay Fine, dinner then.]
@ExperimentWings [Uhh...no.]
@ExperimentWings [I dunno. Don't you need some clothes for the baby or something?]
@ExperimentWings [Shopping sounds nice.]
@ExperimentWings [No. Clue.]
@ExperimentWings [Ahh, sure. Nothing to do here either. Momo is out at work and no treasure to find.]
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe!" He exclaimed as he rushed over to her.
@ExperimentWings [Oh Hey, Ryan! Sup.]
@iKawaiiMomo "Ouch...that's gotta hurt..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Wall!" He screamed out to her as she looked back at him.
@iKawaiiMomo "Writer-kun, they have such a nice relationship huh?" 

//Shut the hell up, Ryuji.
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe! Are you alright!?" He called out to her from behind as he saw her slow down drastically and was panting.
@iKawaiiMomo Welp. There goes Ryuji's chances of winning. Momo was GONE after that.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji followed quickly after. Surprisingly, it didn't take him very long to catch up with momo.
@iKawaiiMomo -would win, but he was going to try his hardest anyway.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji also went into a position to start skating. By the look of momo's eyes, he had absolutely zero confidence that he -
@iKawaiiMomo //Well shit.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji followed soon after.
@iKawaiiMomo "I'd uhh...I'd rather us race. I don't wanna embarrass myself."
@iKawaiiMomo "A competition, huh? Sounds fun!"
@iKawaiiMomo As she said that, Ryuji only became even more worried. "...Huh...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe? What's up with that look...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "That would be pretty sweet, babe."
@iKawaiiMomo Once he started skating, it became gradually easier for him.
@iKawaiiMomo "Couldn't be any more sure honey."
@iKawaiiMomo "N-No, it's fine. Let's just try to make some fun out of the rest of this.."
@iKawaiiMomo -returned the kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo A small tint of pink appeared on his cheeks as he was surprised by her action. He did, however, close his eyes slowly and -
@iKawaiiMomo "Ugh...I should've never said skating..."
@iKawaiiMomo "This date is horrible.." He said as he looked at the ice. The hunter then would start skating again, holding momo's hand.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Fine, whatever. Then you're the only moron."
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe, are you alright!?" He held out his hand to her, trying to help her up.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "You guys are morons.
@iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji then started skating again, feeling embarrassed.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "..."
@iKawaiiMomo "...S-Sorry." He muttered as he got up.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings Ryuji didn't sense a weird vibe from the demon at all.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alri--" And then Ryuji fell ass over elbows onto the ice. Good Game.
@KasaiNoSamurai Ryuji didn't sense a weird vibe from the demon at all.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then removed his hands and started skating. "Huh...this ain't as bad as I thought."
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings -feeding the Angel.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "Hmm, wait. Maybe kentaro should be feeding you." He then looked over at the co-- "Nahhhh~" Continues -
@iKawaiiMomo "Okay..." Ryuji slowly but surely followed every instruction she had given him.
@iKawaiiMomo "A-Already on it, baby..."
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai Ryuji's chocolate was WAY better. He then started feeding Ryan the said chocolate.
@KasaiNoSamurai @ExperimentWings "Heh. #GotEm"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji was extremely hesitant to step on the ice, but did it slowly.
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai Chocolate. Chocolate everywhere.
@ExperimentWings @KasaiNoSamurai Ryuji comes out the cut. "HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Happy Valentine's Day baby! I love you too!~ &lt;3"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "I should've known. Rin..."
@iKawaiiMomo "I-I'll try not to bae..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Wh-Where the hell did you get that pic from...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "...Are you sure..?" He said as he took her hand and got up.
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh...I think so..." His worry filled hues were elsewhere.
@iKawaiiMomo //ITS A ZOMBIE! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji sat next to her, doing the same. He tried his best to brush off the constant fear of tripping and embarrassing himself.
@iKawaiiMomo "Thanks babe.." He took the skates, smiling wryly.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright bae.." He continued to stare at the ice.
@iKawaiiMomo -places...?" He grumbled as he started to feel slightly nervous.
@iKawaiiMomo Upon arrival, Ryuji had gently placed momo down and gazed over at the huge field of ice. "Why did I have to say HERE of all -
@iKawaiiMomo "O-Okay baby..." He then looked down as he walked.
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh...no." He looks away, blushing in embarrassment.
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh....if I said no, would you be mad?"
@iKawaiiMomo -before  lifting her a little higher and fixing himself to make it comfortable.
@iKawaiiMomo He wanted to kiss her lips at this moment, but he couldn't due to the positioning. He then would rub her hamstrings gently -
@iKawaiiMomo "I'm not gonna get tired baby. Trust me."
@iKawaiiMomo "What's wrong, baby? You seem like you don't want this.." He said as he started walking.
@iKawaiiMomo He then took a firm hold of her legs and stood up. "Hold on tight baby."
@iKawaiiMomo -would kneel down for her so she could get on his back with ease.
@iKawaiiMomo "You're not that heavy bae. Here...get on my back." Ryuji then had let go of her soft, smooth hands and turned around. He then-
@iKawaiiMomo "What, you think I can't carry you?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh man, Momo...this is gonna be really uncomfortable walking. How about just give you a piggyback ride?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, let's go babe." He says as he opened the door for his treasure. "After you~"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji waited at the door for her when he got ready.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then would get up and go change.
@iKawaiiMomo "Dammit, what do people do in the winter ti--...Didn't I say I was gonna take you ice skating?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm..." the rubs his chin, trying to find ways to entertain momo
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm..what do us wanna do?"
@iKawaiiMomo "What's up?" He then wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her close.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey momo." He looked over at her, smiling a little.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin Ryuji went in the living room chilling, deciding not to have any more pizza.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Ugh, whatever. Just Gimmie another slice."
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "I'm not even gonna continue arguing with him over this.."
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "So you admit that it's stealing!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo Facepalm moment in 3, 2, 1..."Ugh..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Then it's stealing."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Wait, did you even get their permission to take that pizza?"
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "He stole it..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "...what? So you stole the pizza?"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Thanks..." He took the pizza and took a bite. His tastebuds were in heaven.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo -pissed him off.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Tch..." He then came out of the bathroom a while later. As soon as he heard Rin's voice, it immediately-
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Uhh...a little." He then would get up and walk over to his treasure, seeing if she is okay.
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh...? You owe me? For what? It's what boyfriends do, right..?"
@iKawaiiMomo -gladly go there with her.  With smiling, he gently rubbed the back of his head. "Anything for my treasure."
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe, I'm dead  serious." He smiled back, showing a sincere look in his eyes. If it meant seeing his bae happy, he would -
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh...no, I'm not. You like being there, right..?"
@iKawaiiMomo -annual festival with me?" He asked her as he gently rubbed her side.
@iKawaiiMomo -, but he did it anyway. 
//Ryuji: Fuck it, Yolo.
"Hey, babe...spring is coming up really soon...do you wanna go to this -
@iKawaiiMomo "An annual festival..." He stared at the picture for a good while, until he had an idea. He wasn't sure if it was a good idea-
@iKawaiiMomo He then smiles and wraps his arm around her waist. "Hmm...is that your dad..?"
@iKawaiiMomo //Y1s
@iKawaiiMomo "You mom looks really pretty...a lot like you, actually."
@iKawaiiMomo //np m9
@iKawaiiMomo //Don't worry, I'll tell everyone.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yup...so those are your parents huh?" He looked at the picture.
@iKawaiiMomo "Sigh...Yea, I'm done."  He let out a loud sigh as be sat next to her.
@iKawaiiMomo //Dat missing n doe
@iKawaiiMomo //Gg
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "..." Ryuji tried to hold back his anger as hard as he could, and went into momo's room. "Hey..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo -was true. He then knocked on the door as he got there. "Babe, you there?"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Go ahead, sue me. Like I give a shit..." He then walked off towards momo's room, knowing that what he said-
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Fix what, you face? Because this 'Rich Brat' will be happy to!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //gg
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //But Ryuji just...
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //What?
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin The furious Ryuji then would punch Rin in the face with a semi-enhanced nen fist. "..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo After that statement, he immediately grabbed Rin by the collar, glaring at him. "What was that!?"
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin -had happened.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "He tried to save some girl from the bikers." He completely ignored Rin's statement and told her exactly what-
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "If I didn't 'help' you, then you would have died."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "and I came in and saved his ass. And don't call me blondie."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "I  DID save you."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Yea, like when those bikers kicked your ass." He said as he stopped and crossed his arms.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo And there goes another hit. "CHUMP!? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU CALLIN CHUMP!?"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo -Rin a good, hard bonk on the head. "LIKE I GIVE A SHIT, LIAR!"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo His grip then tightened tenfold over a short period of time. At that point, Ryuji used his free hand to give-
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin -his hand, offering a handshake. "Name's Ryuji."
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Oh....I see..." Ryuji then put back his coat and brushed it off, then walked over to Rin. He then held out-
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "..." Ryuji then got up and grabbed his jacket, on his way out.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "Oh. Well, that's co--WHAT!? Fifth guy!?"
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo -didn't know if she should be angry or just straight up confused.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "I should be the one asking that..." Ryuji said as he looked over at the unfamiliar yet familiar person. He-
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo - thinking 'What the absolute fuck?'
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji and Momo's smooch session ended abruptly as he heard that voice. His eyes widened as he looked at momo -
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown @StreetArtistRin //.
@iKawaiiMomo His hands then would creep down to her thighs slowly, caressing them.
@StreetArtistRin "Yea, no. You still would've got bodied."
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin //Wtf
@StreetArtistRin "Did you see the look on their faces? They would've killed you man."
@StreetArtistRin "You would've gotten your ass kicked if I didn't."
@iKawaiiMomo -rubbing them gently as their lips interlocked.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then kissed her repeatedly at a very slow pace where she could easily keep up. He then would place his hands on her hips-
@StreetArtistRin "Princess? Was I supposed to be offended? Haha... if anything, you're the princess."
@iKawaiiMomo "You moron...just because I gave two doesn't mean you have to..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Ack, momo!" Ryuji then bit on his bottom lip, hiding the subtle moan as she went to work on his neck.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright, alright..I'll stop." For now.
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh..? But I only made 2 so far.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm..?~" He said as he was in the middle of a kiss. His voice kind of muffled due to him kissing her neck.
@iKawaiiMomo He continued to kiss and suck on her neck like his life depended on it.
@iKawaiiMomo -his treasure's neck before lightly sucking on it.
@iKawaiiMomo "Caaant hear you! Marking you right now!" He said as he playfully pulled her closer. He then placed several loving kisses onto-
@iKawaiiMomo "What..? Don't be all flustered babe. You're the one who wanted to mark me--...I should totally mark you."
@iKawaiiMomo //kkz
@iKawaiiMomo //Oh, sure. Gimmie the account and I'll follow.
@iKawaiiMomo //Damn. Step 2 of stalking Writer-chan failed. Onto plan b...
@iKawaiiMomo //Y1s. Nao lemme see that oka-- I mean adowable face.
@iKawaiiMomo -thinking hard about this subject. "If that's the case, I don't mind being marked.." He muttered as he looked elsewhere.
@iKawaiiMomo "It's all your fault, baka. What if I get a hicky or something? Does that mean that you marked me as yours..?" He started-
@iKawaiiMomo //Deal.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's blush then intensified tenfold. That tint of pink on his cheeks then turned into a scarlet color. "Momo, what're you,-"
@StreetArtistRin "No prob. You hurt anywhere? Got a broken nail?" He said jokingly as he continued to tease him.
@iKawaiiMomo //*Waves from window*
@iKawaiiMomo // I bet you 20 bucks that you look purty.
@StreetArtistRin "Watch. The. Shirt.  Or you'll have to worry about me instead."
@iKawaiiMomo "Again with the staring..? I'm starting to feel weird, babe." Ryuji's eyes still stayed on momo as he started complaining.
@StreetArtistRin "I already said it was Ryuji, baka. And watch the shirt, it's one of my favorites!"
@StreetArtistRin "Whatever you say killer. Didn't catch your name, by the way."
@iKawaiiMomo tried'*
@iKawaiiMomo // What do you mean 'would've tribe's? I'm at your window rn.
@MoveWithShadows "Is that even a good enough reason to kill people..? Just because you don't like them?"
@StreetArtistRin "Looks like you were to me, Mr. Killer." Casually points at the knife.
@iKawaiiMomo //wut. I beg to differ~
@iKawaiiMomo "W-Wha..!? Stop that!" A faint blush would then appear on his face.
@iKawaiiMomo //DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THAT
@iKawaiiMomo "What is, babe..?
@iKawaiiMomo "...huh?" Ryuji was completely oblivious to what she was doing and about to do.
@iKawaiiMomo //*Stares at it*
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...I guess you need to try harder at making me blush then, haha."
@StreetArtistRin "BARELY took out half of them, you mean."
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh, damn. Uhh...sorry." He cuckled as he saw his blushing mess of a girlfriend.
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh..momo?"
@iKawaiiMomo //Don't worry about that. If you can't breathe then I'll give you CPR and--*gets hit with a brick*
@StreetArtistRin "Sup. I'm the guy who just saved your sorry ass. Ryuji Minakata."
@iKawaiiMomo "Why're you covering your face for babe? You're adorable when you blush. But then again...you're always cute."
@StreetArtistRin Ryuji proudly stepped on the pile of unconscious bikers, looking at the man. "Well, yea. I didn't know that was the case.."
@iKawaiiMomo "Sure did, honey. She's right here..~" He smiled as he looked at momo, stroking her hair gently.
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh nothing really. This guy wanted me to search for some treasure he had lost for a lot of cash."
@iKawaiiMomo // Oh dear. XD
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm, babe?" He looked over at his girlfriend, opening one eye.
@iKawaiiMomo //ouo?
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji kicked back and relaxed, waiting for his treasure to return.
@StreetArtistRin Then why'd you talk all that shit?!~" He said as he continued to fight the gang, banging two of their heads together.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji let out a sigh of relief as she walked in the kitchen.
@StreetArtistRin -though.
@StreetArtistRin -blows with the bikers. He was using a tiny bit of his nen, trying to not kill them. A few broken bones wouldn't hurt-
@StreetArtistRin "You weren't ...ready...to get you ass...kicked by some bikers!" He said jokingly. His pauses were due to him tradsng -
@iKawaiiMomo "...uhh, no.." Ryuji looked away as he sat on the couch, hoping she wouldn't find out.
@StreetArtistRin -man behind him before he charged at the bikers.
@StreetArtistRin Ryuji quickly joined in to help Rin as he was getting beaten. "You look like you need a bit of help, bro!" He said to the-
@iKawaiiMomo "Yep..." Ryuji took a good, long sniff at the smell of momo's house. He adored that smell badly.
@iKawaiiMomo "Sorry...did you order something cheesy like I thought you were an angel from heaven or something?"
@MoveWithShadows - kill me anyway?" He said, trying to figure out how to escape this really dangerous position he had put himself in.
@MoveWithShadows "Well, shit." He gently poked one of the blades as He gazed at the monster some more. "Just why the hell do you wanna -
@iKawaiiMomo -, but he thought it would be better to just be completely honest with her.
@iKawaiiMomo -be this amazing of a girlfriend.." He said as he rubbed the back of his head. It wasn't the most romantic answer ever-
@iKawaiiMomo "To be honest...the only thing I really thought was that you were really cute. I didn't think I'd fall for you, or that you'd -
@iKawaiiMomo "What do you mean, momo...?"
@iKawaiiMomo As he held her bag for her as they walked. Upon knowing about her condition, he wanted to do anything and everything for her.
@iKawaiiMomo He gets up and grabs her jacket, putting it on for her.
@MoveWithShadows Ryuji then glanced at the figure behind him.* \\sorry
@MoveWithShadows "Ryuji then slightly glanced at the figure behind him-
@iKawaiiMomo "My place or yours..?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Then all the more reason for you to get some sleep right now.."
@iKawaiiMomo "I see...and what do you usually do when that happens?"
@MoveWithShadows "And if I don't? Do you seriously think you can kill me with that gun..?" Ryuji's nen grew and grew, overpowering shadow's.
@iKawaiiMomo kissed her head*
@iKawaiiMomo "Your condition...?" He gently kisses her head-
@iKawaiiMomo "What do you mean...? He held her close and places her head against his chest as she sat on his lap.
@iKawaiiMomo He then sat down at a nearby chair and pulled her to his lap.
@iKawaiiMomo "Baby! You should get some rest right now!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Are you sure? You seem really tired bae.."
@MoveWithShadows "Uhh..."
@iKawaiiMomo He then approached momo and pulled her into a warm embrace. "I know you're tired bae...."
@MoveWithShadows "Lifes greatest music...?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm alright. By the way...are you okay baby..?" He said as he stared at her tired expression with concern.
@MoveWithShadows -his eyes directed at the man with a glare.
@MoveWithShadows "Name's Ryuji Minakata. And I'm a human, if you didn't notice." Ryuji let out his nen aura, clashing with his as he kept-
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...so I guess you're just gonna chill for the rest of the shift?"
@MoveWithShadows -"Hey there..." Ryuji said nervously as he attempted to start a conversation with the man.
@MoveWithShadows -also realized that the strange aura wasn't some kind of nen, he decided to approach the stranger out of sheer curiosity.-
@MoveWithShadows Ryuji quickly noticed the aura that was oozing off of the strange man. It   gave him a quick chill down his spine. As he-
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh? Don't you have the night shift though?" He questioned her as he looked around the spotless area in awe.
@StreetArtistRin -against a wall, shouting "Yo!" Trying to get their attention.
@StreetArtistRin  The entire gang walked towards Rin with bats and knives, glaring at him. Ryuji came to the man's aid as they pinned him-
@iKawaiiMomo //Ugh, gtg to school. I'll reply when I get back.
@iKawaiiMomo He then knocked on the door gently, signaling to momo that he was here
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji walked to momo's job in an attempt to hang out with her on her night shift.
@iKawaiiMomo //GL WITH THAT
@iKawaiiMomo //No you wouldn't. I'm a ninja.
@iKawaiiMomo //Nuh uh...
@iKawaiiMomo //XD
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji took his time enjoying his coffee, looking over at momo. Complete. Infatuation.
@iKawaiiMomo //What..? Pfft...no....maybe.
@iKawaiiMomo "Thanks, babe.~" He took the coffee, followed by a sweet kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo //QwQ Y-Yea..
@iKawaiiMomo //Oh shit. And here I was thinking you were close by
@iKawaiiMomo //In the U.S. (CT) :v
@iKawaiiMomo "Y-Yea. Take your time babe." He said smiling ass she walked away.
@iKawaiiMomo //90 min delay. I love you, ch 3 news.
@iKawaiiMomo // QwQ school is for chumps. Sadly, I have to be a chump for a little while longer..*depressed sigh*
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh, uhh...you should get back, honey. And lemme get the usual. Cream n sugar." He said as he chuckled nervously.
@iKawaiiMomo He held hers slightly tighter. As he was about to kiss her again, he heard her boss' scream, telling her to get back to work. -

@StreetArtistRin -sorry for him, he decided to go help the guy out, walking closer to the group.
@StreetArtistRin -entire biker gang. No, seriously. Every single one of those guys he managed to piss off. "Oh shit..." feeling somewhat-
@StreetArtistRin Ryuji was just walking home from "work" until he shifted his head, noticing that a strange guy was picking a fight with an-
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo -// watching jojo. Night. :3
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //You, my friend, is gonna get a nice starter in the morning. I'm tired af and ish gonna goto sleep -
@iKawaiiMomo //Black hair Ryuji, huh?
@iKawaiiMomo "What kind of question was that? Of course I do!"
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin //Black Jesus sounds cool af tho
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey momo!~" He quickly hugged her back, followed by several kisses.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //Science Jesus sounds like he'd be an asshole.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji sat at the usual table, waiting for his treasure to come to his table.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin //LOL
@iKawaiiMomo "I love you too!" He hangs up afterward, hoping that she heard as he continued his mission.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo // I have a feeling Ryuji and Rin would get along very well...
@iKawaiiMomo "I dunno but soon babe. I gotta go."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "A catchphrase, huh?"
@iKawaiiMomo "After my mission that cafe is the first place I'm headed to, okay!?"
@iKawaiiMomo "O-Oh..." It's not like Ryuji died inside after he heard that or anything.
@iKawaiiMomo "I'm fine. Everything is fine. Almost done with the mission..."
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "What was that..?" 

// Ohh shit. Ryuji don't.
@iKawaiiMomo -her.
@iKawaiiMomo "Babe! Are you okay!? Is everything alright at work!?" He began to shower her with questions, filling himself with concern for-
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo "It's one of them." 

//You don't have a catch phrase, ryuji.
@iKawaiiMomo "Dammit...I can't take it anymore..!" Ryuji takes out his phone and calls momo.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin "Never fear, Ryuji's here!~" 

//Shut the hell up Ryu.
@iKawaiiMomo On his treasure hunting mission, momo was the only treasure he could think about.
@StreetArtistRin @iKawaiiMomo //...maybe.
@iKawaiiMomo @StreetArtistRin //Oh shit. Nvm then...*puts away hentai stash*
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then reluctantly changed  to go out on a mission. "You can do this, Ryu...you can go a day without your bae.."
@iKawaiiMomo //Shhhh...
@iKawaiiMomo "Okay...maybe twice. Writer-kun why must you do this to me..?"
@iKawaiiMomo "God Dammit...that was only once.."
@iKawaiiMomo //...Oh shit...
@iKawaiiMomo "Sigh..I'm gonna miss the hell outta her when I'm on missions.."
@iKawaiiMomo -text me and I'll come kick his ass for you."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji handed momo her jacket as she was rushing out. "Have a nice day at work, baby. And if that weird guy comes back just -
@iKawaiiMomo "I'll make sure to hurry back for you, baby!~" He called out to her as he checked for missions on his phone.
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm. I guess this is where we part ways for a while, huh baby?"
@iKawaiiMomo "You know it~" cue the kiss scene for like...the 50th time.
@iKawaiiMomo -she sits up.
@iKawaiiMomo "Wake up babe. Your Prince Charming is here with your clothes."He smiles as he hands her the work clothes and her keys when -
@iKawaiiMomo -beauty she is.
@iKawaiiMomo After coming back, he found momo asleep on the couch. "Heh, cute.~" He then placed a kiss on her lips like the sleeping -
@iKawaiiMomo //Okay.
@iKawaiiMomo -barricade it after seeing the stalker, but couldn't.
@iKawaiiMomo After a long while, Ryuji walked out of Momo's home with her clothes. He made sure to lock the door. He wanted to freaking-
@iKawaiiMomo // Oh shit. The suspense is real.
@iKawaiiMomo //Is there even anything planned out for that guy anyway? XD
@iKawaiiMomo "Will do, sir. Goodbye..." He then slowly hung up before letting out a loud sigh.
@iKawaiiMomo "...yes sir.." He said as his smile quickly dropped.
@iKawaiiMomo //Ryuji is such a troll.
@iKawaiiMomo -back his laughter. "She's fine though, you don't need to worry about her."
@iKawaiiMomo "Don't worry about that. The last thing she needs is you stalking her.~" His smile grew wider as he tried his hardest to hold -
@iKawaiiMomo "This is her boyfriend, Ryuji. Sorry for tricking you earlier." He smiled mischeviously as he heard her uncle's reaction.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's face became filled with anger as he heard her uncle's voice. "I told you I'm not going back there, and that's final."
@iKawaiiMomo -"hello?~" He said as he put the phone at his ears.
@iKawaiiMomo After closing and LOCKING the door after him, he answered the phone and spoke in a voice like momo's just for the fun of it. -
@iKawaiiMomo //It's all good. :3
@iKawaiiMomo //Which phone? House phone?
@iKawaiiMomo "AndAlsoPlumButLetsLeaveThatForAnotherTime." Cue the awkward moment when he slowly backs away.
@iKawaiiMomo "Tch...the hell is wrong with him and stalking momo.." He then walked over at the door, opening it with the key.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing!" He said as he walked closer to the house.
@iKawaiiMomo "Red. Red and deep red all the way baby~"
@iKawaiiMomo //Yup. ^^
@iKawaiiMomo On his long walk to momo's house, he found that weird man from the cafe at her front door. "What the fuck..!? Not him again..."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright, baby." He sweetly kissed her lips before walking out to go get his girlfriend's clothes for her.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright babe. I'll be back faster than you can say treasure. Hand me the keys.."
@iKawaiiMomo "If you want, I can get it for you if you want, baby."
@iKawaiiMomo "Are you gonna go to your house dressed like that, babe?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, kinda. I've most likely got some missions now.." He said as he gazed over towards his jacket where his phone should be.
@iKawaiiMomo "So..what now..?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's smile grew wider as he leaned in for a loving kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo // Lol
@iKawaiiMomo //hah. See what I did there? *wink*
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea you are!~" He laughed as he saw her blush. "You're my Kawaii momo!~"
@iKawaiiMomo He didn't even realize she was hugging him. He then returned the hug after he noticed. "Not  as adorable as you bae."
@iKawaiiMomo "S-Shuddap..." He looked away as he blushed in embarrassment.
@iKawaiiMomo "Sleep well..?" He asked her as he leaned back against the kitchen counter slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm..?" Ryuji turned around, noticing his girlfriend. "Morning sleeping beauty~" he said as he teased her slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo -his friends, Sawada.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji was in the kitchen after being in the bathroom. He read a note Ryohei had left about him going to hang out with one of -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then got up and walked outside the room.
@iKawaiiMomo In the morning as they woke up, Ryuji sat up and stretched. "*Yawn* Oh man...that was a really good sleep..."
@iKawaiiMomo As she predicted, a couple minutes later and Ryuji was slumped.
@iKawaiiMomo "I wouldn't be so sure about that baby.." He looked into her eyes, his hands still around her waist.
@iKawaiiMomo -that tired baby..." He said as he could barely see her sky blue hues due to her blond locks covering them.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji would lay down beside her and hug her from behind. He placed a kiss onto momo's cheek and smiled. "But I'm not even-
@iKawaiiMomo Several kisses were exchanged after that before they eventually stopped.
@iKawaiiMomo "Shuddup. You probably wanted me to steal that kiss.."
@iKawaiiMomo A relieved smile then formed on the hunter's lips as he kissed her gently.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's frown was still apparent as he slowly wiped momo's tears.
@iKawaiiMomo -even being concerned about it. He thought that he should've been there for her even if he knew what the problem was or not.
@iKawaiiMomo "It's fine, it's fine...! I'm sorry for asking babe...!" He held her even closer, feeling like a complete asshole for-
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh..shit.." He softly bit down on his bottom lip, immediately sitting up to embrace her.
@iKawaiiMomo "It's nothing...just bugs me a little that my girlfriend is having problems and won't tell me about them...I'm fine though."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -something..?' He thought to himself as he stared at the ceiling.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -'doesn't know about' . He wondered why she didn't tell him about it by now. 'Does she not trust me or -
@iKawaiiMomo Meanwhile, Ryuji's eyes were elsewhere. He felt a slight discomfort as they they conversed about this guy who he supposedly-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown He then frowned slightly. "Is it 'him' again?" He said with a serious face on.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -stopped humming and looked at his door, anticipating her arrival.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -humming a tune until he heard his girlfriend's quiet footsteps coming closer towards his direction. Then, he-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji was relaxing on his bed as he waited for momo. Having his legs crossed and his hands behind his head. He-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Alright babe..." After kissing her sweetly, he let go of her and got up heading to his room.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Yea, sure. But what about you babe?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Yup...He isn't waking up for a while.."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "So..what now, Ryohei?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown //closer*
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Scared still? Do you need me to hold you close..?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown After the movie Ryuji stretched and yawned, feeling a little tired
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown //Alright!~
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown //shure to when?
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "What do you mean..?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown His hand then interlocked it's fingers around hers.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji returned her kiss, smiling.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Maybe~" He said jokingly as he slowly moved his face closer to hers.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji then chuckled lightly and kissed his girlfriend's cheek.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Haha, it's okay. I got ya." He said as he looked at her with a reassuring smile as he held her in his arms.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji noticed that momo was surprised at Ryohei. "Dont worry, he loves these kind of movies.."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown // Horror. Ryohei loves him some horror.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji smiled at momo as the movie started playing.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "There's no way that were alike..."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "W-What..?"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "You baka.." He muttered before kissing her forehead gently.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "What did I do..!?~"
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Yea.?" His eyes then shifted to momo's, staring at her attentively.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji then walked with momo towards the couch, taking a seat next to her.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo -immense amount of food on the table.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo Ryuji came back with his new clothes and went next to momo. "Holy shit that's a lot.." He stared at the -
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -in a hurry.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Looks like it's my turn, huh...Ryuji went in the bathroom and closed the door. He then started changing-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji then watched as his brother prepared the 'meal' for them while he waited for momo.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -a sweet kiss upon his girlfriend's lips before handing her the clothes.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Sorry, baby. Just go get changed first in the bathroom over there. I'll change after you, okay?" Ryuji placed-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -dress or somethin'. I dunno..." He said sadly.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -because I couldn't really find anything...just this really big shirt that should fit like a uhh...knee length-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji came back with the spare clothes for them, frowning a little. "I hope your underwear isn't soaked, -
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -some clothes for the two of them.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Oh...Yea..."The two then reluctantly entered the house. Upon entry, Ryuji rushed to his room in search of -
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "W-What kind of request was that, idiot!?" A small shade of pink appeared across Ryuji's face as he said that.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "No problem hun. You can borrow some of my clothes. I'll get your clothes for you in the morning.."
@iKawaiiMomo -back with his girlfriend.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown As they arrived back at the house, he rang the doorbell and knocked 3 times, signaling to Ryohei his bro was-
@iKawaiiMomo "I love you too momo." He smiled as he walked back with her, holding her hand.
@iKawaiiMomo -caressed them lovingly.
@iKawaiiMomo At that point, he tilted his head and closed his eyes, intensifying their lip locking. His hands then crept to her hips as he-
@iKawaiiMomo "Of course you can, baby. I don't mind at all.."
@iKawaiiMomo -not wanting to let go until he was 100% sure she was okay.
@iKawaiiMomo "It's okay...you don't have to say anything...I'll be here for you regardless..." He said as he tightened his grip slightly,-
@iKawaiiMomo -wrong baby?" His voice was calm and reassuring as the rain ran down both of their bodies.
@iKawaiiMomo As he caught up to her, he immediately brought her into a tight embrace. "Babe, are you okay? No, I know you aren't...what's -
@iKawaiiMomo //meant to take Ryohei out that last reply.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -towards his girlfriend but paid it no mind. The only thing he was focused on was her.
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo!" Ryuji yelled out to her at the top of his lungs as he chased after. He slightly noticed the sudden rain as he ran-
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Momo..? What's wrong?" His face filled with worry and discomfort as he got up and followed after her.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Her uncle, huh...? Damn...She must've had it rough..." Ryohei looked down, worrying for her.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Ryohei, don't!" Ryuji called out to him, but then sighed knowing he wasn't going to listen.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Told ya it was amazing."
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Yea, she's alright. She really knows how to bake, though. You should seriously try one of her cookies babe."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -He said after he ate that piece.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji then let go of momo's hand taking the cookie and biting into it. "Tastes amazing...that's Ryan for ya-
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown He held her hand back, locking their fingers. "It's cool. It's this idiot I'm more annoyed of, not you."
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji had an annoyed face as she laughed at the two. "Can it, Ryohei and pass me one of those cookies.
@iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "huh? We're nothing alike, babe."
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo -around her.
@PrinceBeatdown @iKawaiiMomo "Ugh..why isn't he acting shy like he usually does..?" Ryuji took a seat next to momo, wrapping his arm -
@PrinceBeatdown @ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo "How did you know she was an Angel, Ryohei?"
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown "Nonono! You don't have to leave!"
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown -teasing or anything. "Dammit. Why me..." He muttered to himself.
@ExperimentWings @iKawaiiMomo @PrinceBeatdown Ryuji felt like he was gonna die of embarrassment. It's not like Ryan was gonna continue-
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown living*
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown -the loving hell outta him for having a girlfriend now.
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown "Oh, shit..." He notices Ryan in the background and frowns, knowing that she is gonna tease -
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown -kinda forgot to call." He chuckled and rubbed the back of his head.
@iKawaiiMomo @ExperimentWings @PrinceBeatdown "Ahaha...sorry, Ryohei. This is my girlfriend, momo. I was at her place last night. Sorry I -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji rang the doorbell, waiting for someone to answer. "He should answer any second no--"
@iKawaiiMomo -cheerful expression as he smiled. "Oh...we're here."
@iKawaiiMomo "There ya to worrying about me again. You're starting to sound a lot like him. I'm fine babe." He looked down at her with a -
@iKawaiiMomo "He's uhh...he's weird. He can be a bit shy at times. He also is kind of uhh...protective."
@iKawaiiMomo -He said as he slightly took the lead, still walking beside her.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then started walking towards his place with his new girlfriend, momo. "Huh...it doesn't even feel that cold anymore..."-
@iKawaiiMomo //hmm...Alright.
@iKawaiiMomo //on Twitter. I do need to change the bio on twitlong also. ^^''
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji stepped outside next to momo, keeping his hands in his pockets.
@iKawaiiMomo //mfw the bio won't change.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright." He smiled and opened the door for the beauty. "After you, babe."
@iKawaiiMomo // Its all good. Btw...bio change?
@iKawaiiMomo He then grabbed a hold of his coat, putting it on.
@iKawaiiMomo He held her hand slightly tighter and gave her a loving kiss upon her lips. "You should go get ready, babe."
@iKawaiiMomo "Wanna come with? My brother would be happy to see you."
@iKawaiiMomo -her as she was engulfed in guilt.
@iKawaiiMomo "It's not your fault honey. It's the stupid weather." He said softly as he moved closer to his girlfriend, trying to comfort -
@iKawaiiMomo -absolutely zero signs of his brother anywhere.
@iKawaiiMomo -realized something. "Holy shit! I forgot to call Ryohei!" That was it. His Orange haired brother was home alone with -
@iKawaiiMomo "Ehh...don't worry about that. I'll figure something out." Ryuji paused for a minute before widening his eyes as he just-
@iKawaiiMomo "I know, but...It's a while a way before winter ends, and I was planning to take you out on many dates before then..."
@iKawaiiMomo "The beach? Ain't it in the middle of winter?" He stared at her with a dumbfounded expression on his face.
@iKawaiiMomo "Ice Skating it is then!~" He got up and stretched before starting to throw some of his warmer clothes that he had on.
@iKawaiiMomo "Aww, but I picked last time. Oh well...how about uhh...ice skating? Everyone loves ice skating."
@iKawaiiMomo "Another date? Sounds fun. Where to?"
@iKawaiiMomo -nothing to watch.." He said as he leaned back, sinking into the couch.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji sat there on the couch bored out of his mind. His hand stayed on the remote, flipping through the channels. "Ugh...-
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then got up and went in the living room, wanting to watch some TV
@iKawaiiMomo He kissed her back and watched as she left, smiling.
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh, yea..sorry about that momo." He then got off of her, making her able to get up and take a shower.
@iKawaiiMomo "What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?" He chuckled a little.
@iKawaiiMomo -intimate by the second as his tongue traces her lips slowly.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's hands then pressed onto the bed as momo's arms were freed and around his frame. Their kiss became more and more -
@iKawaiiMomo His kiss seemed almost endless as he tilted his head and closed his eyes.
@iKawaiiMomo -lips together once more.
@iKawaiiMomo "why you little..." He mumbled to himself as he grabbed her wrists, pinning her down on the bed gently as he pressed their-
@iKawaiiMomo "Hey, that was my line..." He narrowed his eyes and stared at her, trying not to laugh.
@actual_ghoul "That reminds me. What do you like doing for fun,  Sasako?"
@iKawaiiMomo He came over to the room, fully clothed, and sat next to momo after putting those dirty clothes away. "Back.."
@iKawaiiMomo "S-Sorry. Ehehe..." Cue the awkward walking back to the bathroom scene.
@iKawaiiMomo -shirtless body. "Ohh...."
@iKawaiiMomo "Thanks....Uhh..what's up?" Ryuji gave a puzzled look as he noticed that she was staring at him. He then looked down at his-
@iKawaiiMomo -hair. "Hey, momo. Where do I put my dirty clothes?"
@iKawaiiMomo A while later, Ryuji  left the bathroom in search of momo. He was yet again shirtless, having a towel on his head to dry his-
@iKawaiiMomo "Heh. I'll be back..." Ryuji then went inside the bathroom an stripped himself of his clothes, about to take a shower.
@iKawaiiMomo -it was a habit of his every time he had said or did something to make himself feel awkward.
@iKawaiiMomo "Holy crap. I was just joking but if you really want to..." He smiled sheepishly and rubbed those blond locks of his again.-
@iKawaiiMomo "You know, you can take a shower with me if you want!~" Ryuji called out to his new girlfriend in a flirtatious tone.
@iKawaiiMomo -the bathroom again?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Thanks, babe." He smiled and kissed her soft lips before taking the clothes and walking towards the bathroom. "Uhh...where's -
@iKawaiiMomo "Shirt, check. Boxers, check." Ryuji smiled as he continued to watch her.
@iKawaiiMomo "I uhh...I guess that wouldn't be a good idea either. The only good pair of clothes I have is a shirt, right?"
@iKawaiiMomo -if I just took a shower?" He had questioned her as he watched her search for clothes.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then went shirtless as he  followed the blond haired beauty, waiting for her outside of her door. "Wouldn't it be better-
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea...that was pretty bad." He chuckled and scratched the side of his face. "So, what were you saying about shirts.
@iKawaiiMomo -He had failed horribly. He then looked at momo, smiling as he rubbed the back of his head.
@iKawaiiMomo "Good. Just make sure I don't end up like that Caleb guy or whatever, please.." He tried to say that is a joking manner, but-
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh. So...Uhh...we're dating now, huh?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright, good. So, uhh...where were we?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's golden hues shifted downward towards the floor. "Maybe we should just forget that...happened?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Do you think, uhh...that I should just go?"
@iKawaiiMomo "So...what now...I don't know..."
@iKawaiiMomo "..."Ryuji let out a loud sigh before rubbing his chin. "Mood. Killed." He muttered to himself.
@iKawaiiMomo @CalebRyouka "Caleb? Who's Caleb?" Ryuji looked at her, then back at the area where this Caleb person had walked off.
@CalebRyouka @iKawaiiMomo "What the...who the hell was that guy...?" Ryuji looked over at the unfamiliar person that had walked off.
@iKawaiiMomo "Uhh...alright, but um. What about my question?" He blinked a couple times, staring at her with a puzzled look.
@iKawaiiMomo -girl's attention. He totally didn't feel awkward at all. Not one bit. "You calm now?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji leaned against the kitchen counter, watching as she did so. "You alright now, momo?" He said, trying to attract the-
@iKawaiiMomo -a good idea to approach her while she was overheating and wait for her to cool down.
@iKawaiiMomo "Uh oh..." Ryuji stood there, watching as momo's blond locks swayed slightly as she paced back and forth. He decided it wasn't-
@iKawaiiMomo "Momo? Hey, momo....oh crap, I think I broke her..." He had muttered to himself as the panicking begun.
@iKawaiiMomo -momo. Uhh...speaking of surprising, would it startle you if I said I wanted you to be mine?"
@iKawaiiMomo -effectively. As the kiss broke, Ryuji spoke in that soft and soothing tone again. "That's because I like surprising you, -
@iKawaiiMomo Usually, Ryuji would be surprised by the sudden kiss, but he was kind of anticipating this one. He returned the kiss -
@iKawaiiMomo -blond hair were brushing against each other slightly as his lips pressed against her own.
@iKawaiiMomo -He didn't really care. He had an immense craving for her lips again. He then inched his face closer to momo's until their-
@iKawaiiMomo -hands had left an uncomfortable feeling on Ryuji's back as the water trickled down his neck and slightly made his shirt wet. -
@iKawaiiMomo "Sounds like you're worrying about me a bit too much, momo.." He had moved even closer. After washing the dishes, momo's wet -
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...? I'm just fine. Why you ask?" Ryuji's smile was still present as he held the girl in his arms.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's arms then snaked around the girl as he snuck up behind her, placing a soft kiss on her cheek.
@iKawaiiMomo -away, getting up and walking into the kitchen where the blond beauty resided.
@iKawaiiMomo -recent job posts like he normally does every morning. "Damn...nothing again?" He muttered to himself as he put his phone -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji smiled as he watched her walk away into the depths of the kitchen. He then took out his phone, skimming through the-
@iKawaiiMomo "Thats good, momo. That means we can spend more time with each other, right?
@actual_ghoul -scenery the park had to offer.
@actual_ghoul "Yea...but sometimes crowds can get annoying..." He replied as his eyes wandered elsewhere, looking at the beautiful -
@actual_ghoul "It's pretty lively today..." He looked around at the park and continued walking.
@iKawaiiMomo -spotless plate then back at her in surprise.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm? You're full already? But you just started eating like two minutes ago--holy shit the plate is empty!" He looked at the-
@actual_ghoul -forgot where it was..."
@actual_ghoul "It should be near..." they finally reached the park after busting a couple corners. "Phew...I was afraid that I might've-
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright, Alright." He tries some himself and smiles before going back to feeding her.
@actual_ghoul "I don't mind. And we can go see him after after our little stroll in the park."
@iKawaiiMomo //the typos are real today
@iKawaiiMomo //with a puzzled look*
@iKawaiiMomo "How is it...?" He stared at the girl with a puzzled her look.
@actual_ghoul "He's uhh...He's kinda shy, but if you get to know him he's kinda sweet. Not to mention really protective."
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright then." He sat next to her and held the spoon containing food on it, about to feed momo. "Open wide..."
@iKawaiiMomo //it's cool lol
@actual_ghoul "Ohh, nothing much. I was just wondering if you'd wanna meet my brother."
@iKawaiiMomo "Don't worry about me. I ain't hungry. Not now at least." He smiled awkwardly and rubs the back of his head.
@actual_ghoul "Oh, Ehehe...never mind then!" He chuckled nervously
@iKawaiiMomo "Mhmm. Made something for you, gorgeous." He smiles as his gaze was upon momo and momo only, not having a care in the world.
@iKawaiiMomo -rise and shine, momo..." He called out to her as he placed the food on the table behind him and gently shook her.
@iKawaiiMomo -making breakfast for her..." He quietly said to himself as he attempted to wake the blond haired beauty from her slumber. "-
@iKawaiiMomo After a while, a wonderful aroma filled the room as Ryuji walked in with a tray of food for momo. "I hope she doesn't mind me-
@actual_ghoul "New friends, huh...? Say, Sasako, how old are ya?" Ryuji stared at the girl, trying to guess her age.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm.." he decides to not wake her up and slowly places her on the couch, headed for the kitchen.
@actual_ghoul "It's uhh...noisy, to say the least. Ehehe..especially when you're in somewhere like New York or something."
@iKawaiiMomo -as he sat up and rubbed his eyes, noticing momo sound asleep on his lap.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's eyes slowly opened as the rays of light shining through the curtain was upon his frame. "Mmm..." He groaned a little-
@iKawaiiMomo // XD
@iKawaiiMomo \\ I smell a timeskip coming soon
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji planted a kiss onto her forehead before closing his eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep. "Night, momo..."

@actual_ghoul "I'm from the U.S." he replied as they were nearing the park he was talking about.
@iKawaiiMomo "Go get some sleep, momo.." He said quietly as he leaned back slightly on the couch, arms coiled around her still.
@iKawaiiMomo He returns her kiss, holding her slightly tighter and not wanting to let go.
@actual_ghoul "Soo...where ya from, Sasako?" Ryuji matched the girl's pace, walking next to her and smiling.
@iKawaiiMomo -lost in her alluring hues.
@iKawaiiMomo "That sucks...well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be with you from now on." Ryuji smiled brightly, growing -
@actual_ghoul "Huh? I-I was being dead serious...!" He replied jokingly as he looked at her with a sad expression.
@iKawaiiMomo //lol it's cool. Take all the time you need
@iKawaiiMomo //it's saying you didn't get it.
@iKawaiiMomo //...did you get that reply?
@actual_ghoul "Heh. Your name ain't half bad either. It's cute. Just like the person with the name."
@iKawaiiMomo -my best bud Yukio." He said, sighing after he gave that long speech.
@iKawaiiMomo -Ryohei, is with me. And as for friends...Uhh...I've got a lot but if I had to pick a best bud out of all of em it would be-
@iKawaiiMomo -from a really rich family , but  my dad screwed us all over. I'm a treasure hunter trying to fix his mess. My little bro, -
@iKawaiiMomo Instead of having his hands folded  in his arms, they were around Momo, holding her close to him. "Hmm...well...I used to be-
@actual_ghoul "Hmm...?" He looked back at the girl with a puzzled look, but then smiled sheepishly. "Sorry. Name's Ryuji, haha."
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings "Then do it, baka-rai.~"
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings "...Hmph. So, you gonna propose or not?"
@iKawaiiMomo -her and smiling a little. "M-Maybe we should...snuggle for a bit to keep each other warm?~"
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright...I'll stay here...there's no way in hell I'm going back out there..." He then takes a seat close to momo, looking at-
@actual_ghoul -hands behind his head, taking the lead.
@actual_ghoul "Hmm...there's a pretty huge park south of here. I forgot the name though. Let's just go." Ryuji started walking with his -
@iKawaiiMomo "Oh man..." He rubbed his arms as he walked over to the fireplace in an attempt to warm himself up.
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings "uh oh..." ryuji threw his gloves on, preparing for the worst.
@iKawaiiMomo -them, he took off his jacket and hung it up on a nearby coat rack, sighing in relief.
@iKawaiiMomo "O-Oh god...That was horrible..." Ryuji muttered to himself as they both entered momo's house. As the door was closed behind-
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings "Huh,what? You wanna lose your Angel? You heard that Ryan?"
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings "And you'll lose your Angel if you stop thinking about it."
@iKawaiiMomo -to this late at night.
@iKawaiiMomo "A-Alright..." As they continued to walk towards momo's place, he started blushing, realizing where exactly they were headed-
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings Ryuji catches the fist effectively, smirking. "Hurry up, Ken-chan. If you don't, I'll propose to her."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji covered the girl in his jacket, protecting her from the cold as they continued walking. "Y-Yea..."
-bitches." He said as he walked in front of the two. "So I heard you were gonna marry Ryan."
@Avenged_Hunter @ExperimentWings Ryuji came out the cut, walking into the home of Kentaro and Ryan in the most casual way possible. "'Sup-
@BlazingBabe_ He returned the hug and started to walk away, waving back at Vanessa. "I'll cya round, Vanessa!"
@iKawaiiMomo -they walked outside. "Holy sh-shit..! So cold!"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...So, what now momo?" They continued walking out of the movies and into the cold breeze that immediately hits the two as-
@iKawaiiMomo "It was a bit entertaining. I enjoyed you a bit more than the movie, to be honest..."
@BlazingBabe_ -of his head slightly, sinking his fingers into his golden, bleach-blond hair.
@BlazingBabe_ -talking with you was pretty fun, Vanessa. It's kinda getting late and I best be going, ehe..." He said as he rubbed the back-
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji then placed the empty mug of coffee on the table so that he could get up and stretch, tapping his foot lightly. "Well,-
@BlazingBabe_ "Oh. Sounds like me from time to time."
@BlazingBabe_ "Oh, I see..."
@BlazingBabe_ -usually do on your free time, Vanessa?"
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji then kept staring at the woman's body yet again, noticing that she is ever so close to him. "So, uhh...what do you-
@BlazingBabe_ "U-Uhh...thanks, Vanessa..."
@actual_ghoul "I've been to so many cafes it's not even funny. Park it is."
@actual_ghoul "Hmm...but where to go...?
@iKawaiiMomo -glanced at them, talking about how adorable they look together.
@iKawaiiMomo After the movie, Ryuji and momo walked out of the theater holding hands like the couple did at the end. Everyone stared and -
@iKawaiiMomo //Alright. *^*
@iKawaiiMomo //skip to after the movie?
@iKawaiiMomo //sure.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji placed the popcorn between the two,offering her some.
@iKawaiiMomo "C'mon...Let's just enjoy the movie, okay?" Ryuji smiles and sits back down, waiting for her to follow after.
@actual_ghoul "Yea, I know what ya mean. Well, if it makes ya feel any better, you could always chill with me."
@iKawaiiMomo "Huh? Of course I was..." He slightly looks away in embarrassment.
@actual_ghoul "That sounds..a lot like me, actually."
@actual_ghoul "I'm alright, and you?"
@BlazingBabe_ "Huh..? I am..?" He looks over at Vanessa, staring at her eyes.
@iKawaiiMomo "R-Really what...?" Ryuji blushes as he stares into the girl's eyes.
@actual_ghoul "good evening!"
@iKawaiiMomo // his arms* ^^' sorry
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji snaked his hands around momo's waist, pulling their bodies even closer together.
@iKawaiiMomo -against hers slowly, proving her completely wrong'
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji placed the popcorn and soda on a adjacent seat, getting up and gently holding momo's chin. He then pressed his lips-
@iKawaiiMomo "You uhh...You didn't...?" He stares at her, even more confused as their hands parted.
@BlazingBabe_ "I uhh...I said I guess I'm not that interesting to girls or something."
@iKawaiiMomo "Mmm...!~" Ryuji was shocked by the sudden action but slowly closes his eyes and returns her passionate kiss.
@iKawaiiMomo "What's wrong...? If you want, I'll stop.." Ryuji kept his gaze at her, looking somewhat confused.
@BlazingBabe_ -Ryuji muttered as she took a seat next to him.
@BlazingBabe_ "Yea, I have. Buuut most of my relationships were horrible. I guess I'm not interesting enough for girls or somethin'."-
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...?" He responds in a soft tone, locking his fingers with hers.
@BlazingBabe_ He then looks up at her with a smile.
@BlazingBabe_ "Thanks, Vanessa." He took the cup and blew on it slightly before taking a sip.
@iKawaiiMomo -into her hues, smiling.
@iKawaiiMomo "Aww, momo...don't cover that cute face of yours." He then slowly moves her hands away, holding one of them gently as he stared
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji then took a seat on the couch, waiting for her to return.
@BlazingBabe_ "Huh...your house looks perfect for two."
@iKawaiiMomo "Hehe, it's uhh...fine. Maybe your hand was what I wanted more than the popcorn."
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji then entered after her, taking in that mysterious but wonderful smell of her house.
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji looked around the neighborhood. It looked quiet and...perfect.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then went to grab some popcorn, not noticing her hand was already there.
@BlazingBabe_ "Right now, yea."
@BlazingBabe_ "Yea...you're such a pro at it..."
@BlazingBabe_ "Th-There you go again with the teasing...I'm not..." He looked at her, smiling slightly.
@BlazingBabe_ "Alright...wait, sugar?" Here he goes again, blushing at her constant teasing.
@BlazingBabe_ "So how far is your place anyways, Vanessa?"
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then started to fixate his eyes on the movie, looking over at momo every now and then.
@BlazingBabe_ 'Holy shit. Even her regular clothes are lewd!' He thought to himself before getting up and walking away with her.
@iKawaiiMomo -arm around her shoulders.
@iKawaiiMomo "Yea, really. If I didn't wanna see you again I wouldn't be here, baka." He patted her head again gently before wrapping his -
@BlazingBabe_ "Back to your place? Uhh...sure, I don't mind..."
@BlazingBabe_ "Ehehe..." He felt like he was gonna pass out any minute.
@BlazingBabe_ "Ack!"*
@BlazingBabe_ "Ack! Ryuji's entire face got red as she embraced him and held him really close.
@iKawaiiMomo "You wanna see me more, huh? I wanna see you more also, momo. That face is just too adorable."
@BlazingBabe_ "I-I don't know what you're talking about..."
@iKawaiiMomo He then closed one of his eyes, protecting it as the popcorn hit his face. "With me? What's so special about me...?"
@BlazingBabe_ "Huh? I ain't that good looking.." He looked away, trying to hide his blush.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji followed after her and took a seat next to her.
@BlazingBabe_ -the job pretty well. Aaand now bam, here I am talking to a sweet and enchanting lady, hehe.."
@BlazingBabe_ -with his money and now we're dirt broke. I kinda made it my job to clean up their mess and I found that treasure hunting did-
@BlazingBabe_ "Well, this might sound weird, but I'm a treasure hunter. I used to come from a really rich family until my dad did something-
@iKawaiiMomo -be that bad, can it...?"
@iKawaiiMomo Upon arriving inside the movies, he looked around and found that the area was completely empty. "Oh, c'mon...the movie can't -
@iKawaiiMomo "S-Sorry, hehe..." He had let her carry the popcorn for him and started walking towards the movie.
@BlazingBabe_ "I see...that's a shame. You seem like an amazing woman to me." He looked down slightly.
@iKawaiiMomo He came back with a large bucket of popcorn and two cups of soda, managing to carry them barely.
@BlazingBabe_ -and looked up at her face.
@BlazingBabe_ -liked it when he did, anyway. "So, uhh...tell me more about yourself, Vanessa.." He said after gazing and admiring her frame-
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji then took a nearby seat and stared at the woman, not really caring anymore about looking at her body. She seemingly-
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...popcorn would be alright..." He muttered as he started walking to the food counter, ordering some popcorn.
@iKawaiiMomo "Alright. Let's go watch us a movie!" He smiled sheepishly as he walked to the door and opened it for momo.
@BlazingBabe_ "That was uhh...interesting, to say the least. Kinda looked like you were posing for me instead of that camera."
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then waited for her at the other side, looking up at the movies they had on display.
@iKawaiiMomo -one of those cheesy romantic comedies.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...there aren't that many movies to see right now. That one looks pretty.good." He points at the movie that seemed like-
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji's blush then got worse than it was before, staring as she posed for him and whistled in excitement.
@BlazingBabe_ "I can see why..." He muttered to himself as he followed her again.
@iKawaiiMomo -with a smile.
@iKawaiiMomo A tint of pink appeared on Ryuji's cheeks as she snaked her arms around his. He He then started walking with her to the movies-
@BlazingBabe_ "Woah, looks like you're pretty popular Vanessa...." He looked around, noticing everyone's stares.
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji walked in shortly after her, scanning the area.
@BlazingBabe_ "So this is the place?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm...I dunno, maybe the movies or something?"
@CecilThewildone "Oh. It's a pretty nice hobby ya got there. You should totally draw me sometime, striking an epic pose!~"
@BlazingBabe_ -of erm...sexy...?"
@BlazingBabe_ "S-Sorry for bringing the outfit up. It just looks really lewd. Not that I'm complaining or anything...You actually look kind-
@BlazingBabe_ "Oh. Guess I was right." He chuckled lightly. "So, that explains the uhh...outfit?"
@CecilThewildone "hehe, it's cool. My hair is um...somewhat fluffy. And you draw people?"
@iKawaiiMomo "That was fairly quick, momo. You ready?" He gazed back at her azure hues and smiled as he got up from his seat.
@BlazingBabe_ "So, uhh...are you some kind of model or somethin'" He questioned the woman as he tried to make small talk.
@BlazingBabe_ -eventually gave in to the temptation.
@BlazingBabe_ 'Don't stare, Ryuji. Don't stare, don't stare!' He continued to fight the urge to gaze at her large and plump rear, but-
@BlazingBabe_ "A photo shoot? Uhh, sure. Why not?" Ryuji then stared walking to the area Vanessa was going, having her take the lead.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji sat there, waiting for the girl's shift to be over so they could hang out.
@BlazingBabe_ -dammit Ryu! You couldn't think of something better!?' He thought to himself, becoming a flustered mess.
@BlazingBabe_ "S-Sorry, but I couldn't help it. Your body is just too...amazing." Ryuji's blush then darkened a little. 'Amazing? God-
@iKawaiiMomo -continue drinking that amazing coffee. Little did he know, that amazing coffee was now an amazing COLD coffee.
@iKawaiiMomo "Hmm? We can definitely meet up later. I'm cool with that." Ryuji watched as she walked away and went back to his table to-
@BlazingBabe_ -his hand to her, offering a handshake.
@BlazingBabe_ "Nice to meet ya, Vanessa. The name's Ryuji. Ryuji Minakata." He then gave a bright, friendly smile of his own and held out-
@iKawaiiMomo -anything like that, yaknow." He said as me smiled brightly.
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji then patted the girl's head lightly, reassuring her that everything is fine. "It's cool. Ya don't have to apologize or-
@BlazingBabe_ "I-Its fine...!" Ryuji said in response as he stared at her hues. A small tint of pink appeared on his cheeks as he did so.
@iKawaiiMomo "Kid? Who're you callin' kid? And leave her alone. She obviously doesn't feel comfortable around you."
@BlazingBabe_ As he was trying to not gaze at her voluptuous body, he had slightly bumped into her side.
@CecilThewildone "Something the matter?" He said quietly, noticing the man's constant glances.
@MrSweetsBaker -in need of something to eat.
@MrSweetsBaker "Angel's Sweets Bakery and Cafe, huh?" Ryuji muttered to himself as he was a bit hungry. He decided to walk in the bakery-
@BlazingBabe_ -he tried his hardest not to stare at her...uhh...assets, and continued walking.
@BlazingBabe_ Ryuji left his house on a treasure hunting mission until he ran into a unfamiliar woman with an extremely revealing outfit.-
@iKawaiiMomo -she's working diligently, sir...?"
@iKawaiiMomo -Ryuji's gaze was slightly intimidating as he calmly said: "Is there some sort of problem? Why are you bothering her while-
@iKawaiiMomo Before they knew it, Ryuji was standing right in front of the two, leaning his hand against the table as he stared at the man.-
@CecilThewildone "Not really. Was just taking a stroll, I guess."
@DevilishBlack @ExperimentWings "It means back the hell away from them!"
@ExperimentWings @DevilishBlack " 'Hmoh'? What's that supposed to mean, haha"
@DevilishBlack @ExperimentWings "Yea yea, whatever...Ugh my cheek..."
@DevilishBlack @ExperimentWings //...just had to bust the nanako
@Stylish_Hunter "Alright!" Ryuji took the lead, walking towards the abandoned mansion.
@ExperimentWings @DevilishBlack "O-Ow! The hell was that for!?"
@WildAnimosity "Alright, I'll try my best to not do that, shizuo."
@iKawaiiMomo -taking multiple sips.
@iKawaiiMomo -and see how this plays out to take action. His cup of coffee gradually became more and more empty as he gazed at the two, -
@iKawaiiMomo Ryuji's eyes narrowed a little as he saw this. He tried his best to not interfere, but watch for just a little while longer-
@CecilThewildone "Hmm...I guess you're right. I ain't that bad of a person. I am pretty annoying, from what everyone tells me though..."
@DevilishBlack @ExperimentWings "Thank you? Wait, what the hell! Those are mine!"
@ExperimentWings @DevilishBlack "Wait. Seriously? You stalking me or somethin' Yuki?"
@ExperimentWings @DevilishBlack "W-What!? Don't pin the whole thing on me!"
@Stylish_Hunter "Dont worry, I'll help out."
@DevilishBlack @ExperimentWings Ryuji jumped slightly at hearing the hunters voice then slowly turned around. "Gah! Y-Yukio! Hey there...!"
@CecilThewildone "Likewise." Ryuji shook his hand, smiling back. "So, uhh...what's up? Why'd you approach me all of a sudden?"
@WildAnimosity "Oh? That sucks. I ain't scared of ya. Actually, I was kinda wondering if we could be pals or somethin'."
@Stylish_Hunter "Dont worry, I'll help out. Somewhat."
@WildAnimosity "Infamous? How come?"
@ExperimentWings -questioning her actions. "You seem like you don't wanna see him. At all." He said softly with a puzzled look on his face.
@ExperimentWings "Yea...you might be right. Probably out collecting a bounty or something. By the way..." Ryuji stared at the woman, -
@ExperimentWings "It's 3 in the afternoon."
@ExperimentWings "Oh. So that's even better. Let's go see him now!~"
@iKawaiiMomo "...?" Ryuji kept his gaze at the two, not having a good feeling about that man.
@WildAnimosity "...Huh. so you're the famous Shizuo I've been hearing about in ikkebukoro...?"
@ExperimentWings "Y-You do...?"
@Stylish_Hunter "Were gonna charge into a mansion filled with demons and take back the treasure they stole from a friend of mine."
@WildAnimosity "Hehe, yea. The name's Ryuji, by the way. What's yours?"
@iKawaiiMomo "Er...okay then." Ryuji skimmed his phone once again, looking over at the man from time to time.
@ExperimentWings "Yukio Kazuma."
@iKawaiiMomo -figure out what was the deal with him anyway.
@iKawaiiMomo "Oi! You there! You seem a little lonely standing over there! Come over here!" Ryuji called out to the hooded man, trying to-
@ExperimentWings "I.Know.The.PERFECT.Person!"
@ExperimentWings -lit up, sparkling like he had just found a rare treasure.
@ExperimentWings "Hmm...I'm annoying, you're annoying. Hey...I just got an idea. Let's annoy the shit outta someone..." He said as his eyes-
@WildAnimosity "Haha, yea. I'm not even from Japan, actually..." He rubs the back of his neck awkwardly.
@ExperimentWings "Uhh...well...Name's Ryuji, I'm a treasure hunter, and from what most people tell me, I'm an idiot."
@WildAnimosity "So, uhh...you look kinda like me. I mean...kinda like what I used to look like anyway..." Ryuji approached the man.
@ExperimentWings "Ehehe...I don't plan to..."
@ExperimentWings "Annoying? You ain't annoying."
@ExperimentWings "That's uhh...an effective way of attracting someone."
@ExperimentWings "He didn't? What's up with that man? You're like...beautiful and stuff.." He said as he was eating a cookie.
@ExperimentWings "Dude. That guy is like...the bounty hunter among bounty hunters. I can see why ya fell for someone that badass."
@ExperimentWings "Oh, shit. THE Kentaro Date?"
@ExperimentWings "Having a lover as a demon, huh? Who's the lucky demon?"
@ExperimentWings "No prob. And what did you do to piss angels off for them to wreck your place?"
@ExperimentWings "Yup...oh well. Without that training I wouldn't be the man I am today."
@ExperimentWings "Nothing to it. A part of my training everyday was to clean a whole mansion in less than 3 hours."
@ExperimentWings By the time she came back, he was surprisingly done sweeping the entire floor.
@ExperimentWings -that was over there.
@ExperimentWings "Hmm..let's start over there..." Ryuji then went to the left hand corner in the back and started sweeping up the hot mess-
@ExperimentWings "What? You did?"
@ExperimentWings -that broom and the next I fall ass over elbows into a giant crater. Nice, Ryuji. Nice..."
@ExperimentWings Ryuji came back a while later with the broom, brushing the dirt off of his jacket. "Ugh...one minute I was walking to get-
@ExperimentWings -"So, where in the kitchen is the broo--gah!" His scream was followed by a loud 'THUD'
@ExperimentWings Ryuji immediately hopped over to the other side and went towards the kitchen, ignoring her comment towards the crater.-
@ExperimentWings "Hmm...that's a lot of cleaning...you mind if I help out?"
@ExperimentWings -of angels. He sees demons on a daily basis. Hell, he even got trained by one.
@ExperimentWings "Huh. Never knew angels hated cookies." He said that with a calm tone. He wasn't afraid or anything because she had spoken-
@Stylish_Hunter "What? I never rigged any of em!"
@Stylish_Hunter -seriously suck at gambling, Dante."
@Stylish_Hunter "I may be wrong but I recall you saving my life, us being friends, and then we started making bets with each other. You-
@ExperimentWings "I would if I knew who they were. Who the hell blows up bakeries with delicious cookies anyway?"
@Stylish_Hunter "Enough to pay off your debt for me."
@Stylish_Hunter "Yup. I'm the one hiring you this time."
@ExperimentWings -nomming like he's never nommed before.
@ExperimentWings "So, someone destroyed it, huh? Ain't that against the law or something like that?" He said as he grabbed another cookie,-
@Stylish_Hunter "Oh, darn. I thought you got the new one that just came in already."
@ExperimentWings He handed her ten bucks. No questions asked.
@ExperimentWings -before words escaped from his mouth in an awkward tone. "...h-how much are these for?"
@ExperimentWings After finishing the cookie, he starts reflecting upon life. 'Is this...what It means to live?' Was what rang in his head-
@ExperimentWings -his teeth into it, taking a bite.
@ExperimentWings "Oh nice. Chocolate chip. It's like you read my mind or somethi--...ng." He said as he took one of the cookies and sank-
@ExperimentWings -right about now...' he thought to himself as he saw the bundle of cookies and cupcakes on the floor.
@ExperimentWings -scanned the area, noticing that the place used to be a bakery. '...Huh. now I'm feeling for some chocolate chip cookies-
@ExperimentWings "What uh...what happened here..?" He replied, leaning against the hole that seemingly used to be a window. He slowly-
@Stylish_Hunter "On another mission I see..."
@ExperimentWings -to the building and call out to the woman from a hole in the building. "Hey there..."
@ExperimentWings -that was dealt to the bakery. "Holy shit. That place is wrecked..." He muttered to himself before deciding to walk closer-
@ExperimentWings -and gaze at the building for a while. Upon observing, he found a woman inside, attempting to clean up the major damages-
@ExperimentWings After taking a long tour of the new city he went to, Ryuji passed by a semi-destroyed building. He couldn't help but stop-
@Stylish_Hunter "Yo, Dante!" Ryuji called out towards the devil hunter, waving at him from afar.
@DevilishBlack "It was a demon. He went by the name of Shintaro. Shintaro Usagi."
@NoMoreShinobu As their kiss deepened, The blond haired hunter traced Shinobu's lips with his tongue.
@DevilishBlack "Oh, it's nothing special, just trying to make my nen stronger.."
@NoMoreShinobu After being a bit surprised by her actions, his golden hues slowly came to a close and kissed shinobu back.
@iKawaiiMomo "Haha, maybe there's something here that's attracting him. You, maybe?" He said jokingly, taking yet another sip of the coffee.
@NoMoreShinobu -feel uncomfortable around me or something?" He said to her with a soft tone, trying to get her to look at him attentively.
@NoMoreShinobu -again took a good, long look at those violet hues he knew and absolutely adored. "Shinobu, don't lie. Is it because you-
@NoMoreShinobu Ryuji then held the assassin's chin gently, moving her face towards him. With his other arm coiled around her waist, he once-
@iKawaiiMomo His eyes then averted back towards the girl, showing a lot of concern for her. "Are you sure it's nothing?"
@CecilThewildone -a friendly handshake."
@CecilThewildone "'Sup. Name's Ryuji." Ryuji took one of his hands out of his pockets, slightly exposing one of his tattoos and offered-
@NoMoreShinobu -everything okay, shinobu?"
@NoMoreShinobu He turned around, his eyes fixated on the assassin, pondering about why she was looking at everything BUT him. "Is uhh...is-
@NoMoreShinobu "Gah!" He flinched slightlyand quickly  turned around as he heard her voice. "S-Sorry...hey shinobu."
@NoMoreShinobu -like the new hair and tats..." He muttered to himself while walking, not looking where he was going.
@NoMoreShinobu Upon getting ready, he started heading towards the school, somewhat worried about his new appearance. "I wonder if she won't-
@NoMoreShinobu "Alright. I'll see you there, shino-chan~" After hanging up, he then went into his suitcase, looking for clothes.
@iKawaiiMomo "Something wrong, momo...?" Ryuji took another sip before looking over at the man.
@iKawaiiMomo "That was quick. Heh, thanks momo." He took the coffee happily and took a sip. "Huh..taste way better than usual."
@iKawaiiMomo -for any available missions.
@iKawaiiMomo "Haha, alright. Take your time momo." He smiled brightly at her. After she was gone, he skimmed through his phone, looking-
@iKawaiiMomo "You didn't? I always come to this cafe every now and then."
@iKawaiiMomo "Just the usual. Coffee, cream and sugar....Wait. Is that you, momo?" He turned towards the woman, staring at her.
