That was nice 
LMFAO 
Epic Collab of exchanges. Lol 
@NO_TATS_B @RealFLYTYE .....is actually gonna be a really good QB too tho. System or not
@NO_TATS_B @RealFLYTYE LMFAO, True, but I honestly think Jimmy Will play great &amp; they definitely could go 4-0. But I also think Jimmy....
@Guare456 oh ok. Just saw that tweet &amp; realized I never responded to it
@Guare456 just clarifying that I wasn't using it as a "code word". I literally meant there's all kinds, races, &amp; types of ignorant people
@Guare456 That tweet was pertaining to me saying ignorant people. I was just clarifying that I meant ALL IGNORANT PEOPLE
@Guare456 Absolutely not. But not everyone thinks like we do either, so most people will, unfortunately
@Guare456 How about "FED UP!" That's what I call them. Lol
@Guare456 but you know I didn't mean ANYTHING LIKE THAT in context tho. I dont have that mindset.
@Guare456 Partly because they do have a point. Like the word "Thug." Calling somebody ignorant these days is Code for the N word really
@Guare456 I know you knew. But somebody else reading probably woulda been like: Oh NO HE DIDN'T! lol. U know.
@Guare456 Exactly.. when I said ignorant people. I definitely wasn't talking about One group, or race. I was just talking EVERYBODY
@Guare456 EXACTLY... It's the Matrix man. Too many people plugged in, living in a perception. Not the real world. They in a fantasy
@Guare456 I wish Everybody could just be on the same page/ level
@Guare456 Facts. But people gotta take responsibility to educate themselves. Knowledge is truly power. Too many ignorant people
@Guare456 I'm with you on that. I'm all about it too. Problem is not enough of us
@Guare456 Heres the problem. People today so brainwashed there arent any DR Kings out there anymore. They Don't make them like they Used to!
Yea man, it's all super sketchy when u start hearing about the history AND the lack of Funding for a cure &amp; etc. 
@Guare456 It's a sad, sick world we live in man. It's really crazy when u get older &amp; u open ur eyes to stuff that goes on. Loss for words
@Guare456 Another Example: A young person makes a mistake &amp; has Unprotected sex 1 TIME, 4 the 1st time &amp; gets HIV. Life over, unnecessarily.
@Guare456 Because they make MUCH MORE money "treating" the illnesses than JUST CURING it. It's SICKENING
@Guare456 Cancer, Aids, HIV, Herpes, Lung disease, man theres cures..or atleast MUCH BETTER medicines out there for people &amp; they won't fund
@Guare456 Great example. Also, ANOTHER THING that the Gov. Makes me sick with, is the big Pharma scandals. There's so many cures for stuff
@Guare456 Right &amp; it's not fair. Nobody saying they deserve a pass. They should be PUNISHED... But to be shunned for the rest of life? Crazy
@Guare456 Like that's honestly the OPPOSITE of helpful.
@Guare456 what part of that makes ANY SENSE AT ALL?
@Guare456 EXAMPLE: Kids get caught selling drugs to support self/family. Then have a record that causes them to NEVER be able to get a job?
@Guare456 it is, &amp; Nobody can tell me the Gov. Wants to rehabilitate people, that is a joke.
@Guare456 Exactly. Like Not blatant evil. Just otherwise good people falling on circumstances that cause them 2 turn 2 make dumb,bad choices
@Guare456 ....to accept &amp; live with for the rest of my life. Which is punishment enough. Lol
@Guare456 ....isn't qualified or developed enough to deal with. It's just crazy man. I've learned it the hard way, &amp; things I've done I have
@Guare456 ...influence them to make the choice or mistake that was made. Some kids are dealing with real Grown up Stress that their mind...
@Guare456 Exactly &amp; that's why we are not qualified to pass judgment on ANYONE. Because No one knows the struggles that person endured to...
Younger people have no clue how CRITICAL early life choices they make are, until its 2late. Every1 deserves 2nd chances. NOT EVERY1 GETS 'EM
Its crazy &amp; sad that u can make a mistake when ur young &amp; in a wreckless frame of mind. Then it determine the outcome of ur life later on.
Ouch, they're gonna feel it 
Daaaaamn! 
He's a STEAL 
Yes! 
Can't be serious 
How does that work tho? Like did people just stay there for 11 days? 
So stupid 
@TheZenSettings Shoot Darryl Morey is rolling in his grave with Jeremy Lin. Lol
So is Yao, Clyde, &amp; Hakeem 
JJ really has become a different player.
I still can't believe Matt Barnes told Ms. Harden to suck it. Lmao hilarious
Houston.......YOU, .....YES, YOU have a problem.
Blake was about to POSTERIZE Dwight Howard
JJ Reddick is absolutely KILLING Corey Brewer
This is The Lob City they spoke of all this time, right ? 
Damn, the Clippers are SPANKING these Rockets hardcore
@cathville I'm with you. F it. Hack nothing. Play ball
1000 
I'm kinda With Shaq, they hacking Deandre Jordan to exploit a weakness, but really IT'S NOT WORKING. JUST STOP IT.
Former Knick: Kostas Popaknickalau

@cartoonnetwork BRING BACK "THE AMAZING WORLD OF GUMBALL!" WE NEED NEW EPISODES. YOU ARE DOING THE WORLD A DISSERVICE! PLEASE!
Just found out that @ADAMDEVINE from Workaholics was the voice of Pizza Steve. LMFAO too damn funny.
#DraftAcademy is a great show. I absolutely can't get enough. The draft is over &amp; I still watch when it comes on
This is an absolute fact. Used this trick every time 
Daaaaamn! That's the point of no return 
@ZD0LLAH Doris Burke is just a stiff. She's not a cool dude. Lol
@ZD0LLAH Yea no doubt. She's got money too. And then you got Flo for the side chick who also has money. So you killed the right one. Lol
This is epic 
@ZD0LLAH No hesitation, whatsoever. You sir, are a savage!
@ZD0LLAH  YIKES. I applaud your bravery
Doris Burk, Ellen Degeneres, Flo from Progressive.....  Fuck, Marry, Murder.....GO!

 
Here we go....
Does anybody remember when Vince Carter was supposed to be the next Michael Jordan?....No I'm serious, that really was a thing that happened
Take 5 &amp; crank DOWN
First team ALL TONY
Paul did you call bank, on the bank shot? :   "I called game."

*Drops Mic*
@Chris_Whelan7  Fine with me. Jennings, Dre Will, Vereen. After that man, doesn't matter to me, best man wins a spot
Stop it. He didn't do it for a TD against an NFL SECONDARY. Not the same 
@CVasiento It's SOOOOOOOO going down
@CVasiento Yessir. Bourbon, Sesame, Gen Tso, Lo Mein, Crab Rangoon, Teriyaki. That's what I get down with. Hibatchi &amp; Pepper Steak too!
Sweet! 
Hate when I can never decide what I wanna eat. But I think it's gonna end up being Chinese tonight. Bourbon Chicken w/Broccoli.... FTW!
@Yung_Messiah HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@Yung_Messiah They have the WORST secondary in their own division for sure. They dont have not even one legit secondary player
@Yung_Messiah I said it because I truly believe it to be true. Not just because I wanted to talk smack back to your team.
@Yung_Messiah  I know you're not. That's how you know I was just speaking in facts &amp; not attacking your team just to respond back.
@Yung_Messiah More like: Beckham, Cruz, and Even Dwayne Harris is gonna torch that Cowboys shitty ass secondary. All year long
@jtnyg  Maaaaan I can't do it. Cuz that means I would have to watch it first!
@alexpokerguy Or a DEFLATOR! Lmao. Hey Practice squad too
@alexpokerguy  Yea I saw. That's Awesome! He should be signed immediately. Sucks that he's a WR tho. Gonna be hard to make a spot for him
@cblockd If that doesn't work, I'll use the Kids as an excuse. A movie of that caliber, should NEVER be watched in the presence of Children.
Never! I just need a plan. I was thinking of staging the ever effective "Fake Fight."  
This is AWESOME. I hope he's got the same last name. 
I dont know how I'm getting out of this one, this time, she's got me dead to rights. But, I'm not giving up tho! I will keep Fighting!
My Girlfriend: "Ooo! Let's go rent 50 Shades of Gray! It's out on Redbox!" ...........
DAMNIT! I've been ducking this situation since day 1!
@Hey_its_Don ....him exactly what they were gonna give him anyway, before he ever got injured. Does it change their approach at all?
@Hey_its_Don I get that. But what I'm saying is: Will they push for the LOWER end of the scale Now because of his injury? Or do they give...
@Hey_its_Don I understand that, but I wonder if they use the injury as a negotiation tool against him, to give him less $$ than they woulda
@ShakesNYG Thanks for the follow back fam. We are ONE. Lets get this thumb ring!
@cblockd @ShakedownShow Besides every show needs an Italian guy. Just because. Lol. That's my opening argument.
@cblockd @ShakedownShow Im gonna follow these dudes &amp; see whats up. U know I'll be a hit, if I call. Lol They may hire me 2 help do the show
@cblockd @ShakedownShow Hmmm interesting. I'll have to check it out
@cblockd The What? Lol. I guess because I've never heard of it. Not familiar bro. What is it?
Me personally, I'm not gracing the field until that paper work is done. I need that security knowing what money is guaranteed to me #Fowler
Worst thing about the Fowler injury? He hasn't even signed a contract yet! I wonder if the Jags try to dick him around about his money.
I imagine Odell will be pretty high on the list of NFL NETWORKs top 100
This TWEET was baffling. But not annoying 
Dude.... Lmao. Dudes NICKNAME was "The Deflator" u CANNOT MAKE THIS UP.
So unfortunate.  
So is. 
Sick Bastard 
That BIG TIME SUCKS for Dante Fowler. He tore his ACL First real chance he got. Like ASAP
Damn Fowler
@GMENHQ @ProFootballTalk Maybe because one is an ACTUAL CRIME, &amp; one is a crime against integrity? Did that REALLY need to be spelled out?
@LicensePlateGuy He personally, &amp; CONSCIOUSLY, HAND PICKED The Cowgirls. Had any choice he wanted &amp; picked them. Which makes him worse.
@LicensePlateGuy Not to mention, there's no love lost. He's the enemy now. Even more so than guys who are just drafted by DallASS.
@LicensePlateGuy  Not to even mention he really hasn't been OFFICIALLY CLEARED &amp; may never be..... It's weird
@RealPittBull @HuffPostWeird Oh yea I'm sure. I just think the headline is hilarious. "Hookers for Hillary" lol
But healthcare we gotta pay for? 
This is GREAT 
I knew better than to watch TV with my Girl. Now I'm stuck with The show Botched. Which is growing on me. Unfortunately.
@x_colorrmepinkk He was looking as his homeBOYS ass &amp; didn't even know it. He was Sick about it too at the end of that video. LMFAO
@x_colorrmepinkk He saying he saw one of his HOME BOYS dressed like a woman &amp; didn't realize it until he already was checking him out! LMAO
Plax is definitely always gonna be the man. 
@TylerIAm @SullyFootball @wizzyjr Sad part is, they got credit for that! Lol. I see an A+ .....perfect 7 out of 7 on that paper
I didn't witchcraft You're Daughter....she just looks like that 
LMFAO! I'm dead. @x_colorrmepinkk  
@AGoldFan @joeovies @Shannon_Penn  Gronk's delivery was Randy Macho Man savage. It's Rick Flair. It's WWE. Deflate DEEZ.......WHOOO!
Gronk said deflate DEEZ.......lmao. 
@RobGronkowski Never Change bro. NEVER
@DAR12321 @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  Taken some big steps up, finally reason 4 optimism, imo. Oh &amp; YOUR WELCOME for Justin Tuck.
@DAR12321 @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd Now that all you Raiders fans are here, just wanna say I like what you guys are doing.
@DAR12321 @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd LMFAO!
@Jeff_LJ_Lloyd @Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz  I really dont understand how you could interpret that I thought he was a Cowboys fan. Bad Analysis
@DraftOrtiz @Coximus2 @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd @JuMosq Lmao I dont have the hair for that....lol
@Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  And yours is a DICK SHAPED Cactus.  *Drops Mic*
Damn those bums got Collins for a Steal too
@Coximus2 @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  I think that you don't have a clue what you're talking about. Which is even better
@DraftOrtiz Now that Collins is the Enemy he was thrown in there with the rest of them. Obviously I'm disappointed because I WANTED HIM
See this the mindset I had when I wrote that tweet. Wasnt directed as a shot @ Collins specifically. But @ DallASS 
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd &amp; OBVIOUSLY I'M TICKED he went to our biggest division rival. So u should understand me poking them in the ribs.
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  We need him desperately. And I woulda loved to have him. That's what made me salty enough to crack that joke
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  I would literally take La'el Collins on my team right now in a heart beat without thinking for half a second.
@PepeinVegas @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd But I will say this. That Locker room could potentially bring the worst out of ALL those guys who do
@PepeinVegas @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  I guess his name being in that LONG list of other guys who have had proven problems threw you off.
@PepeinVegas @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd Glad somebody used their common sense. It literally wasnt even that serious. It was a JOKE
@PepeinVegas @DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd THANK YOU.
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd THE POINT of my tweet, was a joke. That was it. Period.
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd Problem no, concern yes. At 1point it was enough CONCERN that 1strd guy went UNdrafted. NOT point of my tweet tho
@DraftOrtiz There was ENOUGH concern AT ONE TIME that a first round Talent went UNdrafted, no?  Oh yea that DID happened.
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd  All the others, BESIDES Collins, best of luck defending them. Have to wonder how POTENTIALLY toxic a locker room
@DraftOrtiz @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd Yea read it. You jumped to conclusions. Just relax. It was a joke. Never accused him of doing anything.
@DraftOrtiz Ignore the fact I never even insinuated he did. Just saying. The ALL OFF FIELD CONCERN team. So what's ur excuse for the others?
Cowboys really? F U La'el Collins!  Rolondo McCLain, Gregory, Hardy, Collins.. All they have to get now is Ray Rice. The ALL OFF FIELD TEAM!
@Espngreeny ...probably is gonna be the closest u can get to definitely. Even though he Publicly it's PROBABLY. We definitely know hes right
@Espngreeny Well if you don't have Legal power to force people to cooperate &amp; turn over evidence to make probably, a definitely then.....
This is EXTREMELY sad 
VIDEO: 
PLEASE COME BACK! 
I dont think Tom Brady gets a big punishment &amp; heres why:1)What he did wasn't THAT BAD. 2)The 2Guys deciding are His former teammate &amp; Roger
@Paulie_Bruz But the whole: "No comment &amp; I've never saw these two men in my entire life. Talk to my lawyer/agent." Isn't helping him
@Paulie_Bruz ....deflate them to illegal levels. My bad." If he woulda said something like that, then I really dont think it'd look as bad
@Paulie_Bruz I like it on the lighter side as little air as possible within the regulations but I never INTENTIONALLY requested them to....
@Paulie_Bruz I honestly think if he woulda just been like: Yea I like my ball a certain way, every 1 does. But I didn't realize it was under
@Paulie_Bruz Like the way he's trying to completely act like he's never seen those two equipment guys in his entire life. It's ridiculous
@Paulie_Bruz I actually think Tom Brady's handling of this whole situation is worse. It's like he's even acting like it's a big deal
@Paulie_Bruz Thank You. Spy Gate was FLAT OUT BLATANT CHEATING. This is like... Meh, slight rule bend. Kinda.
Situation over just like that. Its the whole "Ryan Braun like" denial &amp; stance hes taken on the situation. Pretending he don't know the guys
He coulda just been like: Yea I requested the ball 2B @ minimum cuz I like it that way. But I didn't intentionally have them UNDER inflated.
If Tom Woulda just held that press conference &amp; said, yea man everybody likes their ball a certain way. But I didn't realize it was under
I Completely agree w/ @markschlereth hes spot on about Brady. I don't think its a big deal. But Tom is making it that way. Handling it bad
That was soooo NOT meant to happen. Lmao #Shaq
SHAQ DOWN
OMG THO...Those texts from the Patriots 2 equipment guys. That may literally have been the most HILARIOUS exchange ever. Thought it was fake
Blake is Iso-Killing the Rockets single handedly with the back down spinning one hand jump hooks. Which is ALSO MY Go to move on the court
@PhillyGiL They piss me off! Rec Jackin' &amp; then swear they nice cuz they scored a few uncontested weed buckets. Lmao
@PhillyGiL Passes the bud &amp; is wide open, unguarded under the basket. Bastards. Lol
@PhillyGiL Or even worse dont call timeout &amp; just stays on the other side of the court. Multitasking. Cherry picking while smoke rotationing
@PhillyGiL  X.DEAD.X  Lmao.... or calls timeout to hit his homeboys shit that's being passed around on the side bench.
Who the heck is Lester Hudson?
@RealPittBull Yea but I just feel he would pay off 10 fold if he would harness it &amp; only do it when he HAD TO. Instead of All the time
@RealPittBull I comprehend his ability, but he would be TWICE the player if he just let jukes come to him, &amp; not LOOK to always break ankles
@RealPittBull He plays too much man. Always looking to "Barry Sanders somebody" instead of just being a patient decisive runner
@MontaukFishKing @TommyBeer I hate James Dolan Soooo much. I can't believe we are forced to deal with him as an owner for who knows how long
@PhilJackson11 Is there ANYWAY u can suck sooo much $$ outta James Dolan that he just GIVES YOU the Knicks, permanently? I want this guy OUT
LMFAO 
I dont understand how he can be THIS PERSON I'm watching right now. But be somebody who ALLEGEDLY assaulted a woman sexually. Its JUST WEIRD
4 Jameis Winston 2B that different of a person away from the football field....idk. It has 2B one of the worst cases of Jeckle &amp; Hyde EVER!
Like everything That's been recorded pre draft of him working out, &amp; his personality is just AWESOME.
IDK if hes just a good "show-men"or if its the REAL Jameis Winston. But from what I learned about him he really SEEMS like a great dude
LOL I'm watching path to draft w/J Winston. Haha. He told his girlfriend she was looking as good as Beyonce, but with power of Oprah Winfrey
@IMShawnAndrews It's sad they force this garbage on average people knowing MOST of them can't really afford to buy the REAL FOOD
@IMShawnAndrews Wish I had the money to eat healthy. It's a damn shame if you wanna buy REAL FOOD you gotta take out a loan to grocery shop!
@xI_Usernamex @J_Forrest_73 Missed the whole first Quarter of the season &amp; put up Impressive, ENTIRE SEASON numbers.
@xI_Usernamex @J_Forrest_73 The ridiculous catch put him on the national scene. But numbers don't lie. ESPECIALLY only playing limited games
Believe it when I see it, but coming from Dansby is encouraging 
@spiceNsports Makes people collectively just shake it off &amp; count it as another disgruntled person who is crying wolf. Which is SAD
@spiceNsports ....like Shady just did, then it takes AWAY from the people who actually have LEGITIMATE CLAIMS of discrimination.
@spiceNsports I agree. It's unnecessary. BCuz the type of thing he's talking about DOES REALLY GO ON in our world. But when guys cry wolf...
@jasonrmcintyre @CutonDime25 Ur just one of those guys who doesn't get it. On or off the field.
@jasonrmcintyre @CutonDime25 Hes getting rid of CLOWNS, not black players. This ridiculous comment is part of WHY you're not on the team now
How would they get more money from you within 6 months, if they did that? It's done ON PURPOSE 
Hey @Espn you gotta get rid of @ESPN_FirstTake its horrible. Keep @CariChampion cuz she Rocks. But give her a different show or something
Ouch #Fail 
@x_colorrmepinkk ikr
@spiceNsports You dont hear Nick Foles complaining. Lol. He got shipped out too &amp; he was the STARTING QUARTERBACK. Shady needs to just chill
@spiceNsports ..PLENTY OF ALL KINDS of players. Drafted Two with 1st rd picks &amp; signed others. Shady is just DUMB SALTY about getting traded
@spiceNsports It's kinda embarrassing, &amp; unfortunate that he would even stoop to that level &amp; try to pull that card. Chip has brought in....
@spiceNsports THANK YOU. Look if there was ANY evidence to back up his claim. I would be ALL ABOUT calling Chip out. But come on, man.
@x_colorrmepinkk wow. They went Hare crazy 
@bomani_jones Idk man I dont see it. Hope I'm not wrong. If there was a pattern I could follow or see I would understand, but I dont see it
@bomani_jones it's expected. He replaced Shady WITH DeMarco, Ryan Matthews, traded 4 Sproles, drafted Jordan Matthews&amp; Agholor. Traded Foles
@bomani_jones He's shipping out Andy Reid's players, guys who are older, too expensive, or don't fit system, not buying in, etc.
@bomani_jones Shady was a behind the line of scrimmage dancer, who was on the wrong side of 20's, playing wrong position, wanting TOO MUCH $
@bomani_jones IMO, which no one cares about. It's a ridiculous claim &amp; a shame Shady would stoop to pulling that card with really no merit
@BSO and besides that he never 100% bought in to the Chip way, &amp; always flirted with being a distraction. So I dont see it man
@BSO Shady was a behind the line of scrimmage dancer, who was on the wrong side of his 20's, playing the wrong position, wanting TOO MUCH $
@BSO IMO, they virtually shipped themselves outta town. Chip has brought in Murray, Drafted Agholor, J.Matthews. Dumped Foles. Makes 0 sense
@BSO Guys who don't fit or aren't 100% bought in to what he's doing. Which its well documented that Desean, Nor Shady were &amp; Spoke out on it
@BSO It's really disappointing he would stoop to pulling that card. Chip is shipping out the Clowns, Divas, distractions, &amp; elderly.
@BSO Nick Foles isn't black &amp; played a MUCH more important position then RB &amp; was shipped out just as quickly with no hesitation
@BSO Look I just went on a rant about that. But if there was ANY proof to it at all, then he should definitely be called out. But come on
@RealPittBull Frank Gore was the type of RB 4 that. That running style is 4 Buffalo. Not Shadys behind the LOS ballerina act. But blame Chip
@RealPittBull Shady isn't gonna put up those numbers in Buffalo in an offense that FORCES you to Hit the hole hard &amp; go consistently
@RealPittBull If anything, Shady should be thankful to Chip. He SCHEMED AROUND his flaws to make him have the best season of his career!
@RealPittBull  And it takes the seriousness out of the LEGIT claims where people are TRULY being discriminated against. Cuz it DOES happen
@RealPittBull I'm done man. Sorry 4 the rant. But I hate when guys pull that card w/ no merit. Cuz theres areas of life where IT DOES go on
@RealPittBull Hes dumping Andy Reid's players who were getting older &amp; also being a distraction with exception of T Cole (Not a distraction)
@RealPittBull Chip isn't dumping race specific players. He's dumping CLOWNS. Guys who are only half ass buying in to what he's doing
@RealPittBull Is Demarco Murray white? Ryan Matthews, Sproles, Jordan Matthews, Agohlor? Is Foles black? What am I really missing, here?
@RealPittBull ...There's no way I would even come at him like that. I would definitely do my homework. But he literally MADE NO SENSE AT ALL
@RealPittBull I mean did u see that garbage? Im open minded, if there was even REMOTELY a chance Chip was signaling out black players....
@CutonDime25 Its called UPGRADING. Face it,ur a dancer. U dont hit holes.Ur CONSTANTLY trying 2make a highlight instead of JUST DOING UR JOB
@CutonDime25 So Nick Foles is black too? He sure shipped his ass outta town just as fast as he did you. Has nothing to do with race
@RealPittBull Sorry man. The guy is a fantastic TALENT, who has a fantastic inability to comprehend things &amp; control his mouth piece
@CutonDime25 He's fine with all players, as long as they FIT HIS SYSTEM &amp; AREN'T CLOWNS. Grow up. You &amp; DeSean are IMMATURE. PERIOD
@CutonDime25 You ought 2b ashamed of yourself trying to pull the "Chip Kelly got rid of especially the good black players" Card. Ridiculous.
@CutonDime25 Don't pull that card bro, u &amp; Desean were CLOWNS PERIOD. And ur a backfield dancer. FOH with that. Demarco Murray is black too.
@art_stapleton Our OL would INSTANTLY be transformed from a bunch of older washed up guys, to the youngest biggest potential OL in the NFL
@art_stapleton It would be amazing if everything checked out with him &amp; we were able to sign him. I'm sure Odell could help the recruitment
Wow. Crazy, but is it really a crime? 
That's how we like it 
While I'll admit, James Dolan's love 4 Isaiah Thomas knows no bounds &amp; its creepy. BUT I don't get the Panic about him taking Liberty job...
Randy Gregory is gonna feel like a clown when he gets cut/traded &amp; he's stuck with that huge hideous DallASS fuckboy star on his arm. Lol
I really think the Colts are gonna compete for a championship this next year coming up. They are as primed as ever
10 Life sentences for Shit that's on this list, &amp; a bunch of shit that's not, but should be. 
@PhilJackson11 Like Really tho, screw Gasol. Get Mike Conley. &amp; maybe Tony "First team all defense" Allen. That'd help the Knicks, big time!
@PhilJackson11 Any way you can swindle Mike Conley away from Memphis? That'd be awesome, thanks.
@RicBucher True, but if GSW end up pulling it off, series is over. It'll crush Griz, knowing deep down, they can't play any better than this
Nope....lol 
IMO, if GSW end up winning this game its gonna CRUSH Grizzlies moral 4 the remainder of the series. Essentially over. Can't play any better
@UncleGusNyc @RVacchianoNYDN Too bad we weren't early enough &amp; aggressive enough to land Duron Carter. I woulda loved to bring him in.
@RVacchianoNYDN It's about darn time we explored ALL possible options looking for talent. Why Rule out Canada? It's just Due diligence!

Memphis up 6. 
@LogicalHater Geeze. You don't "Put out a fire... with a match"
@LogicalHater If anything, I'm with you on that. Dude is completely irrelevant on this team.
@LogicalHater I wasn't technically accusing you of saying I did, either. Just wanted to clarify what I meant in my previous tweet. JIC.
@LogicalHater I def. Wasnt saying I wanted him back, I was really asking if he still played for GS. Cuz if so, he's INVISIBLE
This outfit is why they don't consult you on Coaching decisions. But they do Durant. 
@CFD22 Did Bo Wallace enter the draft? Heard 0 about him. I'm not a huge fan of him, just wondering since, I thought he was coming out
Shit, if thats true, I wish the Knicks were as boring as the damn Spurs! 
@JuMosq He's got an SEC frame &amp; build. Guy looks like the freaking Terminator. You'd think one of those big time schools woulda tried
@JuMosq Wow he transferred from Penn State really? You'd think he would have gotten the opportunity to transfer somewhere other than Baylor
Is that David Lee guy even on Golden State anymore? If he is.....they sure as hell don't need his ass. Lol
Hope not, cuz u kinda need TWO of those guys

"@SNYGiants: Odighizuwa: The New York Giants’ heir apparent to J.P.P.? 
@OptimumScouting Maybe they inquire about La'el.... if everything checks out on his end. Makes sense.
Aren't you glad you didn't bet on the draw? 
Ray Lewis 
@xI_Usernamex Except that type of fan doesnt know as much about the games or the sport as they do about the bands. But talk as much about it
If everybody boycotted the Rematch that would be so hilarious.
Of course he did. Why not get more money? Especially if Pacquiao was just so darn "injured" gimme a break. 
The Pacquiao injury is BS. They gonna say oh NOW HE'S HEALTHY.....sooo REMATCH
@ESPN_Colin @TheHerd I think it'd be smart to call Chauncey Billups for a coaching job, if I was a coach needy team. Does he wanna coach?
How long before somebody calls Chauncey Billups for a coaching job? Seems like a no brainer. I think he'd be better than Fisher
@afc2nfc What's going on? I missed it all
So lil punk ass Beno Udrih is gonna be the reason Marc Gasol doesn't even consider the Knicks, huh? #Hater
@afc2nfc Gotta be some kind of contractual obligation 4 the BROWNS to sign anybody who plays football w/any variation of the name PAUL BROWN
@afc2nfc And.... HIS NAME IS PAUL BROWN-ING they HAVE TO sign that guy!
Rand University
@Chris_Whelan7 The kid came out extremely early. But looks as if he woulda stayed &amp; played more college ball, coulda been a high pick Guard
@Chris_Whelan7 Great plug 4 our OL in a few yrs, if developed properly, we might have a 1st or 2nd rd type player down the road in the 7thrd
@Chris_Whelan7 Hart is so young &amp; raw but outstanding measurables, big potential, has alotta experience for somebody so young. Could be a..
@Chris_Whelan7 The best late round pick out of them I think was Bobby Hart tho. That one could actually have great positive impact later on
@Chris_Whelan7 Geremy Davis is another Ramses Barden. Project but has nice potential. Too bad hes a cowboy fan. Loser. Lol
@Chris_Whelan7 Both high upside low risk guys. Worthy of drafting, also fills a need. Thompson is a Rangy coverage centerfielder type
@NyQuilAndVagina They won't be able to pay everybody. Iggy, Curry, Thompson, Barnes, Green. Eventually they gotta move somebody
@NyQuilAndVagina I liked him in the draft that year. You're right tho, we def. Should. Something has to give with that Warriors roster.
I see Draymon Green to be like a young Z-Bo. I can see him as that kinda player down the road. Maybe even better.
I really liked Draymond Green that yr in the draft. The Warriors were fortunate enough to be able to coach the maximum potential out of him
I'll say this. I think ARod finally figured it out, sure took long enough. But besides playing magnificent baseball but handling media well
Wow 
@CVasiento oh he's an Indiana guy huh? Had no clue. I just know him from Memphis in the NBA. He always seemed like a genuinely good person.
Mike Conley is an underrated PG 4Sure. But he really seems like a cool guy, a great teammate &amp; an all around good person. So I wish him well
How do you leave Curry of all people, wide open?
Steph Curry is already 27? Damn, I thought he was like 24
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 Yea cuz Twitter is never talking about things they know nothing of, right? Just wait &amp; see man.
Well deserved, they should give him another 3 for having to go to Cleveland &amp; play 
Just Falcons probably. Division rivals &amp; New Orleans just got basketball 
@AJASOTNY600 @Guare456 Good, he needs to be. Keep his ass sharp or he can be replaced by someone who is
@AJASOTNY600 @Guare456 Maybe. But I think we're good on the line now. Bobby Hart was a great pick &amp; we got the kid from Canada too.
@Guare456 Gonna be a great rotational piece for the DLine. Could even maybe start.
@Guare456 He's great value. He has had trouble staying healthy &amp; getting banged up but the dude is a complete DE who is a good pass rusher
@Guare456 But the defensive end we took in round 3 outta UCLA was a guy who really coulda went in the late first, def EARLY second round
@Guare456 He's got a few issues to work out with coverage &amp; stuff but he can improve on that.
@Guare456 Yea he's really not that little. He's 6 foot flat, but yea he does LOOK stout. Solid tackler &amp; can thump with the best of them
@Guare456 I think he COULD Start at Right Tackle for now. But they want him to be the Left Tackle eventually. Hes not ready for that.
We shall see, He's a really quiet laid back guy. I wish he was more nasty off the field &amp; way more on. 
@Guare456 Landon Collins is DAY 1 Antrel Rolle all over again. If he pans out Safety is locked up for 10yrs, no question in my mind
@Guare456 After RD1, Reese went on an absolute rampage. Was aggressive &amp; WENT AFTER value, instead of waiting around 2see what value is left
@Guare456 a big time WALL for Eli &amp; a monster in the run Game. He's far away from that tho right now tho. Def plugs a huge hole for us tho.
@Guare456 The First pick at 9 was a high upside guy, but largely a raw player. That's the one that makes me a little nervous. But could be..
@johnadeleon Right but Football's plays are short. There's constant stoppage. Basketball flows &amp; could go on for like 10mins b4 a whistle
@johnadeleon its like get him off the floor &amp; let him be examined &amp; let them sub somebody else in. That's crazy.
@johnadeleon Yea I understand that part of it, but the trainers didn't even tend to him until the whistle. Get that guy out of the way!
The Hawks passing might even actually be BETTER than the Spurs
@johnadeleon They dont keep playing in football. And that's FOOTBALL. Whats Basketball's excuse?
The NBA HAS GOTTA DO SOMETHING about guys who are really hurt just being left laying there while everybody else keeps playing basketball
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 Ok Mr. District Attorney. I'm glad you know so much about this case
@Guare456 yea hold on, I'll put you on
@Guare456 As far as the Giants go. Jerry Reese is in TOP GM mode again. Dude nailed it outta the park this year draft wise. He killed it.
@Guare456 Pretty damn remarkable. I think also their lack of a sure fire ELITE LEVEL STAR. Is another reason, but who cares, they're BALLING
@Guare456 Exactly. Number 1 seed. At first, Thought to be just a bottom tier borderline playoff team, MAYBE. When the year started
@Guare456 I'm talking about just giving them the credit they've earned by just making it to where they are now. They dont even get that!
@Guare456 I can buy that. Winning it all is one thing. But I'm just talking about, who thought they'd even be in the second round?!
I think it's pretty much time to give these Hawks their credit. They're a much, much, much better team then ANYBODY could have imagined
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 .....talent has to take a back seat to things that are more important than football. Character is bigger these days
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 If everything checks out, trust me, he'll get his opportunity. With everything thats gone on with these players lately
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 Nobody wants to draft or be associated with the Next Aaron Hernandez so just chill out on that until details come out
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 If everyone was 100% clear on him not being involved whatsoever he woulda definitely been drafted or signed by now
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 Don't u think Its a little weird that EVERY SINGLE TEAM passed &amp; not even ONE rolled the dice? There's something 2 it.
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 They DON'T know that. How can you say they know anything? U know what they know? Something we DON'T. EVERYBODY PASSED
@TagMyJPP @Giants_101 Even if hes a murderer? Come on man use ur brain. Obviously if details come out &amp; hes cleared then they may reconsider
There really must b something to the La'el Collins stuff that we aren't being told. Teams have inside knowledge. ALL 32 passed &amp; none signed
Facts. They watch too many Rocky movies 
This cannot be a real tweet 
The 10 of you did WHAT? 
@Geeeeemen Only did what?
Those Knocking Floyd for his issues are kinda acting like Pacquiao doesn't have any. Neither one are Role Models. F em BOTH!
This is the REALEST TWEET EVER 
Especially if its really true that he can't read, I honestly think thats pathetic. But hey, hes doing something more right than I am. #Broke
Damn, I have ONE KNOCK on Floyd. No hate whatsoever. But you have ALL THAT MONEY &amp; no desire to better yourself thru education?
Damn Evander Holyfield pretty much said MEH. Rematch for What? Lmao! Wow. That's real. Real from one of the realist
Ereck Flowers is a really, REALLY quiet &amp; laid back dude. I hope he has that nasty switch to flip on the field.
But it doesn't mean he HAS TO do all that talking. Deserving or not. That's why people don't like it, I guess.  
Rich people stay winning. Milking everyone out of 100 more dollars for 20 minutes of nothing.
Exactly

Intriguing question. Why doesn't "Gronk-Cam" exist? Seems like a No Brainer

@elo_bajo But yea Carter's kid was my biggest offseason target. I wanted him bad. Not only great pedigree, but light bulb finally came on
@elo_bajo Yea definitely glad we brought him in. He definitely looks like he could be quality depth &amp; a versatile player.
@elo_bajo Oh ok Nevermind, yea, I remember when we signed him. He's a different guy.
@elo_bajo Oh that's the kid from Alabama, no?
Wow! #CLIPPERSvSPURS
@elo_bajo what's his whole name? &amp; yea I'll definitely take him. We need that for sure

About damn time they started

 "@RVacchianoNYDN: And seriously, the Giants are owning Canada right now."
@Paulie_Bruz I honestly don't know if a better job could've possibly been done, by him or anybody else.
@Paulie_Bruz He didn't reach not once, made smart deals, didn't overpay guys &amp; got TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS value via trade &amp; in the draft.
@Paulie_Bruz Hes very quickly stockpiled quality offensive talent, while also improving defense at the same time. Dude did his damn thing
@Paulie_Bruz I will say, maybe the best move he's made wasn't even draft related. That robbery he pulled on the Rams for Zack Stacy was EPIC
@Paulie_Bruz Macagnaan seems like he's got a good grasp on things &amp; seems to have you guys in a good situation for years to come.
Jets got Stacy for a 7th rd pick! Daaaaamn! That was a steal
Hope he doesn't get tested 4 wearing that. Is he giving away money?

What is going on with this Chick on NFL Network? She is having a bad day....
@DaveCapone No Doubt!
Landon Collins said he compares himself to Earl Thomas &amp; Kam Chancellor. That's not what he is. Honestly he's Antrel Rolle. That's my comp.
@nflnetwork @Giants Unanimous #ThumbsUp
&amp; I can promise you, we'll be a better team for him doing that, too.
Jerry Reese finally did what we been wanting him to do got aggressive &amp; went after value instead of waiting around to see what value is left
@CRANSTON_NYG I wouldn't say many turned on him, he always gets the benefit of doubt. But being frustrated with him lately, is more like it
@Giants You guys made me proud today. Rock Solid 3 picks. Great Value in the 2nd &amp; 3rd! Tell Jerry Reese he hit a home run today. Thanks.

@NYGreenMachine He was the WR who got in trouble with Terrell Pryor at Ohio St. Over the tattoos. Big body. Had some moments in NFL
@NYGMEN4LIFE @bigblueview Not true. He was only making that decision to do that IF he didnt get picked in the 2nd or 3rd round.
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex HOME RUN 3rd round Pick!
@bigblueview But I am SO COOL with Taking Odigizuhwa!
@bigblueview Immense value with La'el in the 3rd round. Too good to pass up if I'm Jerry Reese.
@bigblueview Me personally. If I'm the Giants, I'm doing it. I'm picking La'el Collins. &amp; Pray he's got nothing to do with that Death.
That was a Rock Solid selection by the Bears. Grasu is a future pro bowler. Jay Cutler just Ran out of Offensive Line Excuses.
Jets Get Devier Posey from Texans in that trade. Nice Depth. @NYGreenMachine
Great back to back picks by Seattle &amp; Houston. I like Strong &amp; Lockett
Now all hes gotta do is pass the drug tests.
I have no doubt in my mind that the fact weed is legal in Denver played a part in Broncos being willing 2 trade up &amp; still take him in 1stRD
Telling u, Denver Drafting Shane Ray was low key Smart. It doesn't matter if he gets caught w/weed on him in Colorado. No negative headlines
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I'm crying laughing about Gregory combined with SAD TEARS for Ali Marpet being gone now
@NYGreenMachine But who was I kidding? Shoulda saved my breath knowing Rex was the one going to be tasked with that responsibility. #Doomed
@NYGreenMachine To be developed &amp; brought along slow &amp; needed help making the transition &amp; If it was done correctly, JETS woulda had a STEAL
@NYGreenMachine I told you from the jump. Tajh was a high upside great character, clutch performing QB in college. But needed thoroughly....
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex  I'm dying laughing
@NYGreenMachine There's coaches in this league that woulda got what we expected out of Boyd last yr. Rex wasn't one of those guys regardless
@NYGreenMachine I'll be 1st to say I expected more too. BUT I will honestly say, With Rex as a HC theres no telling if he got a fair shake
@NYGreenMachine Not much Promise left 4 Boyd right now, but can u really say theres THAT MUCH MORE 4 Geno? Can't really say that confidently
@NYGreenMachine Well. 1 thing I can say is I'm pretty sure hes still a better choice than Geno. Regardless of how they're career played out
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 Right?! How awkward &amp; uncomfortable but incredibly mature at the same time. Lol
@NYGreenMachine Yea absolutely agree... But it makes sense for the Jets fans who are flipping out for a QB. Lol. BTW Tajh Boyd signed w/Pitt
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 Looked her in the eye &amp; said Mom, I'm going to Alabama. &amp; Put his hat on. #Day1GrownMan
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 With his MOTHER sitting right there basically BEGGING HIM to go to LSU. That's wild
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 Think about what a mature &amp; bold thing that was to do for a young HS kid on NATIONAL TV
@LogicalHater @alexpokerguy @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 That was EXTREMELY HILARIOUS. But it made an important point. Hes a leader,not follower
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 ....on national TV &amp; picked Bama on National signing day? During recruiting? Lmao
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 Correct me if I'm wrong. But isn't Landon Collins the one who Snubbed his Mom &amp; LSU?
@alexpokerguy @LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 Liked Orchard too
Move over Mantai Teo.
Randy Gregory just SEEMS COMPLETELY FULL of Shit. Fuck him.
Hey Look Michael Strahan's bitch just announced Philadelphia's pick!
@JSlicklen Washington?!
@WilliamJamerson  I dont know anything. Landon Collins fell to the SECOND ROUND
Betcha Chip Kelly takes Jake Fisher OT
FUCK YOU MINNESOTA!
Secretly I'm impressed with the Redskins draft this year
We can Still get Eric Kendricks too! Dream come true!
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy ....a great, mature &amp; kind dude. Straight up leader.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Said She knew Vinny Sunseri &amp; Collins both &amp; Vinny was a douchebag. But Collins was...
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Im talking character wise, My boss knows him personally went to school at UA
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Not that this needed to be pointed out, either. But Landon is a fine young man too
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 yea im cool with what just went down. And WE STILL got a 3rd rounder to use!
Brett Hundley 3rd round for the Jets. Watch. @NYGreenMachine
But we DIDN'T GET a coverage safety..

"@xI_Usernamex: @LogicalHater @Sum1UshouldNo I like Berhe a lot man, but we needed a coverage safety"
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater That was a nice little Pick there. Can't really be mad at that
@Patricia_Traina Guess the Coaches weren't as confident in those Safeties as you thought....
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater One of the Collins'!
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater Then see how Pugh can adapt &amp; what he can give us at Guard &amp; ask him to Bulk up in training camp
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater So I dont think there's any reason to Waste time with Flowers at G. Throw him right out there at Tackle.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Because I think they EVENTUALLY wanna move Flowers to LT. So they'll groom him with experience on other side 1st
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I'm cool with picking La'el for sure. But I'm just saying. If we miss out then I see Flowers being RT
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I think Pugh was viewed as a Guard who CAN PLAY tackle. Not the other way around.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex 2be fair, I think Pugh has always been looked at as a Guard at the NFL level. Always been a knock on Arm length
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater  Then Schwartz &amp; Beatty at LT, LG.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I actually think that Ereck Flowers is going to play Right Tackle &amp; Pugh Kicks inside, plays next to Richburg
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater Well he played like one Rookie season, then hit a sophomore slump. Let's see what he does this year.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex But if it really is over Nothing, then it's a damn shame what happened to him
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I feel bad for the kid, if it's truly over nothing he did wrong. I'll reserve judgement until the truth is told
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex True but atleast it's not lost forever. He'll be just as valuable next year too, if he's cleared
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater Which is actually a really smart business move for him. Why take less? When you already know what you're worth
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater Damn somebody better take La'el TONIGHT cuz if they dont he wont sign with anyone &amp; just go to next years draft.
If only he was in Colorado before the draft took place all that week. Probably woulda never got in any trouble
Now the NFL drug tests are his responsibility to find a way to pass them, other than that Shayne Ray is all good to have weed on him now
I see you @Broncos smart move drafting Shane Ray. Weed is legal in your state, so no worrying about him getting in Legal trouble for it...
I just thought how smart it was for the Denver Broncos to draft Shane Ray. They'll never have to worry about him getting arrested for weed!
@RMaloney82 @NYGMtD @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 Either way, it has no bearing on Drafting Collins or not. If hes the BPA when we pick, take him!
@RMaloney82 @NYGMtD @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 Could be a good thing &amp; be pleasantly surprised. Or it Could be an awful realization they suck
@RMaloney82 @NYGMtD @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 Nobody knows including the coaches how these guys will perform once The Regular season starts.
@RMaloney82 @NYGMtD @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 Camp &amp; Practice performance &amp; conversation determines WHO PLAYS ON SUNDAY. NOT HOW THEY'LL PLAY!
@RMaloney82 @NYGMtD @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 I wasn't saying the guys we have weren't good either. Just making the point to Mrs. Traina that
@RMaloney82 @NYGMtD @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 But if Collins is best player available when we pick, take him regardless of the CURRENT guys
@RMaloney82 @Patricia_Traina @NYGMtD @WBG84 Absolutely agree. Im not making a case FOR OR AGAINST Collins or ANY OF THE SAFETIES WE have now
If he was the best player available when we pick? YES!  

"@NYGMtD: @Sum1UshouldNo @Patricia_Traina @WBG84 Mike you agree we need Collins?"
@Patricia_Traina @NYGMtD @WBG84 As if guys HAVE NEVER fallen short of a coaches expectations before. This Happens ROUTINELY.
@Patricia_Traina @NYGMtD @WBG84 That doesn't mean u know they'll be solid starters against other teams. Camp, practice&amp; conversation means 0
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Yea agree. No question it's tremendous value. Coulda been drafted up there with Brandon Scherff. IMO.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I'm rooting for him, hope it does check out, and I hope we are the team smart enough to take a chance on him.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I'm not sure what's up, hope he's innocent, but if so, then why not just get it over with, ASAP?
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Im not gonna pretend like I know whats going on. But he started doing right thing, but then didn't talk to cops.
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Nah bro, BEATTY is the back up. Pugh can start
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Yea if La'el Collins starts going undrafted I'll take him in the 7th just incase
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I want Eric Kendricks or Landon Collins
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Otherwise I'm really not sure why in the world he's not getting any attention. He certainly deserves it
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex I think theres an issue with his hip not checking out well enough. Pretty sure that's why he's fell off boards
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Totally agree about it, &amp; coachability being major factor. I wish him the best. Talk 2u guys later. Have a good day
@NYGreenMachine  He's not giving up until week one. Lol

"@Geeeeemen: @Sum1UshouldNo  
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Schwartz coming back too is gonna be huge for us, imo. Our line woulda been better last year if not for injury
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 That's what its all about. I hope he's everything a 9th pick should be, because we DESPERATELY NEED it. Esp. On OL
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 I have no problem changing my opinion of a player if he earns it. Evolving my frame of mind as I learn more abt him
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 I'm a really easy guy to win over if you're the real deal &amp; prove it. I have no problem admitting being wrong
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 I'll come around. Especially if he shows up on game day each week &amp; starts stone walling guys &amp; keeps Eli upright
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy ....Cuz that's what'll erase all doubt from my mind that he'll eventually reach that ceiling that seems pretty high
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy If his work ethic is off the charts (which is something I don't know much about) then I'm all the way cool with it
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Well hes our guy, I hope hes ready to work &amp; take responsibility 4 his own development as a pro. Lots of work ahead
Great point, about Coachability.

"@alexpokerguy: @RomoCop74 so feel free to have slightly less 'concern' with 4 months before Game 1 :)"
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I really feel he coulda been had much later. I think we coulda traded back got more picks &amp; STILL GOT THE SAME GUY.
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Look honestly guys, my BIGGEST issue is not that we drafted him. It's WHEN &amp; the fact it was an obvious REACH at 9
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I'm willing to not get 2 down on him &amp; give him a fair benefit of the doubt. I obviously don't wish Failure on him
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy He's really raw, he's really sloppy technique wise &amp; he's not a Pass Protection specialist. LT is just different
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Because u DON'T TAKE a Right Tackle or a Guard at 9th overall, so I assume they are hoping hes a LT eventually. IDK
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy For a LEFT TACKLE, I want a polished pass blocker. I'm assuming they view him as a LT judging by being the 9th pick
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy He plays low when he run blocks. My issue with him is PASS BLOCKING. He consistently gets beat high in Pass pro
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I'm actually cool with the versatility. It's smart because injuries are so major. But LEFT TACKLE is different
@alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut @RomoCop74  Soon as u say "reach" for a guy, you should just stop yourself right there..unless hes a game changer
@alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut @RomoCop74 I Don't get the Rowe connection everyone trying to make. I want Erick Kendricks here or the  safety
@alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut @RomoCop74 Great point. Almost gotta take him, like No Brainer style. Just makes too much sense not to do it
@TagMyJPP Noooo thanks on Gregory. Hes really not that good. Just physically talented. But on the field he's average. Underachiever BIG time
@NYSportzNut @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Ugh maybe. I really dont know if I even want him. He wasn't my favorite safety anyway. Now we're stuck
@NO_TATS_B I wanted Demarious Randal or Byron Jones to play safety for us this yr. Now we get neither &amp; are stuck with Landon as the only S
@NO_TATS_B I know, I actually wanted Randle &amp; thought somebody else would take the Collins bait &amp; leave Randle out there 4 us to steal. Smh!
Bro can't believe Randle just went BEFORE Collins. Knew he was a good pick for Giants. Hope Collins will be there for us. Doubt it tho
Laken Tomlinson. U SIR are something 2B proud of as a fellow human being. Honored 2 breathe the same air as u. Good luck changing the world!
@BC101089 I'm Skeptical but something CLEARLY has been different about their approach lately. Much more football, much less DUMB
I would really love to know who Jerry Jones secretly pays to handle the draft these days. These recent picks have been WAY too good 2 be him
@NYGreenMachine They coulda pulled that off man. Chip has final personnel say &amp; Mariota woulda gave him all the leverage with that.
@NYGreenMachine Whisenhunt sucks. Man if I was Mariota, I woulda helped Chip out&amp; said I wouldn't play 4anybody but Chip, Boom, Simple, done
@NYGreenMachine Who or.... what the hell was that "brother?" Lol
@NYGreenMachine &amp; IF there was something that he could come up with, that would interest Titans, then a trade could definitely still be done
@NYGreenMachine Your missing my point. I never said he would be successful in pulling it off. All I said is he's still trying, believe that
@NYGreenMachine what did I tell you? I told you he was still trying. Why come out &amp; say that? Cuz obviously somebody (Chip) is pushing 4 it.
@NYGreenMachine I don't think anybody foresaw Williams slipping that far. I know I didn't at all
@NYGreenMachine You think I'm joking? Trust me man. He's not giving up. He's gonna keep working  until the season starts. Believe that
@NYGreenMachine Jets shocked me with their pick. Can't argue with Leonard Williams tho. Awesome player
@NYGreenMachine Chip will absolutely be trying acquire him all the way until they kick the ball off week 1 man. He's not giving up. No way
@NYGreenMachine I wouldn't apologize yet. He didn't draft him, but that doesn't mean he's done trying to acquire him. No doubt in my mind...
@Ploof007 @GregParchment ...Roll the dice &amp; PRAY TO GOD he didn't have anything to do with that unfortunate Situation. That could be a STEAL
@Ploof007 @GregParchment I've watched him too, bro. Just really didn't make any impression on me. I hope We draft La'el Collins in the 7th..
@Ploof007 @GregParchment If you say so man. I hope like hell you're right, because we DESPERATELY NEED HIM TO BE ALL THAT, &amp; MORE!
Completely forgot about Nate Orchard from Utah. He's a guy I would like to steal later in the draft. Nice potential
@Ploof007 @GregParchment I see Will Beatty 2.0 with more versatility &amp; MAYBE A marginally better upside/higher ceiling. If we're lucky
@Ploof007 @GregParchment I dont see 50%. I see someone who may not improve it AT ALL for a while, cuz he's not a plug &amp; play right away guy
Andrus Peat AND Brandon Scherff playing tackle were both better  

"@GregParchment: @Sum1UshouldNo who was better?"
Ha! Not even CLOSE. Right tackle? Maybe.   

"@GregParchment: @Sum1UshouldNo im not a homer he was the best tackle in this draft"
@GregParchment .....but I didnt wanna take him at 9. That was way too high
@GregParchment I agree we needed An Offensive Left Tackle. That isnt what we really got tho. That's my problem. I didn't care if we took him
@GregParchment Spoken like a true Homer. He wasn't worth a 9th pick . Hes not a left tackle.
@NYGiantsRush I hate Ereck Flowers for a 9TH Pick. Shoulda traded back. If that's who they wanted
Erick Kendricks, Hironiss Grasu, Arik Armstead, Byron Jones, maybe Bud Dupree if he slips, Denzel Perryman, Demarious Randall.
@CJ28MTL Pshhhh.
@RomoCop74 nah, but I did forget Randle
Erick Kendricks, Hironiss Grasu, Arik Armstead, Byron Jones, maybe Bud Dupree if he slips, Perryman somebody who is a fringe 1st rounder!
@xI_Usernamex Hope your boy Dupree is there in the second.
I seriously hope we get a STEAL in the second round, like Erick Kendricks, Hironiss Grasu, or Arik Armstead. That will help even things out.
We just drafted a Younger, slightly higher upside Will Beatty. To replace Will Beatty. I just dont understand.
Reese CANNOT DRAFT LBs, OL, or RBs. Those are his worst 3 positions. He's awful at drafting them. In that order. LB being his WORST position
Danny Shelton sitting right there. We coulda traded back &amp; got Flowers still Ugh. Cam Earving. Andrus Peat. DAMNIT. I know we needed OL. BUT
Smh. That sucks ASS. We just drafted Will Beatty again.
HERE WE GO G-FAM LET'S DO THIS BABY!
@NYSportzNut @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Shelton is a 5 Down guy if need be, IMO. I don't buy him NOT BEING a 4 down guy. He's fine
Todd Gurley to Falcons? Interesting. He'd be Dan Quinn's Marshawn Lynch
Ok for me, My choices are: Danny Shelton, Andrus Peat, Landon Collins, Erick Kendricks, Beasley, D.Parker in NO PARTICULAR ORDER.
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut I will take any of those guys mentioned in my previous tweet &amp; be fine with it
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut On the low, I'll trade back &amp; take Eric Kendricks too, why not? Maybe Landon Collins, Peat, or Shelton
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut Love Shelton
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @NYSportzNut Rather have Peat than Flowers. I don't even know. I like Danny Shelton a lot too
Neither  

"@bab1104: @RomoCop74 @Sum1UshouldNo @alexpokerguy   Flowers or Beasley ??"
PLEASE GOD, Dont let Giants be silly &amp; draft that overrated Ereck Flowers. That'd be highly disappointing for me, Not a fan. Rather get PEAT
HELL NO! I DON'T WANT FLOWERS NO MATTER WHAT!  

"@RomoCop74: @Sum1UshouldNo @alexpokerguy where sre we going now?  Flowers?"
Wow! WHAT THE HELL DO THEY NEED HIM FOR?! Mo Wilk &amp; Sheldon?! Now Williams too! Embarrassment of Defensive Tackle riches!?! Holy Cow!
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74  Alex, how about that crazy stuff for A likelihood?! No freaking way I saw Leonard Williams fall out of the top 5!
I'm SCARED TO DEATH that ATL is gonna scoop Leonard Williams now. It's inevitable. No freaking way they pass on him. Smh
WOW first surprise to me. Well that changes a few things around a little. Leonard Williams is OUT CHEA'!
Have no Clue what these bums are gonna do, honestly
@NO_TATS_B  I'm with you all the way, don't wanna give up anymore Firsts .... BUT I'll give up 2 seconds or one 2 &amp; next year's 3
Holy Shit Leonard Williams actually made it to 4! Does Jerry Reese pull that trigger? Like the 
No doubt in my mind, Chip is STILL ON THE PHONE with Tennessee trying to offer ANYTHING to make them trade their brand New QB. It's NOT OVER
Damn Tennessee didn't trade....Smh. I dont like Whisenhunt to develop a guy like Mariota. But oh well. Maybe Chip will trade HIMSELF TO TENN
But let me be clear, I'm 100% confident MARIOTA WILL a successful NFL QB &amp; be able to run ANY SYSTEM he's asked to.
Situation will determine what kind of Career. Mariota could turn into Aaron Rodgers or end up just being Alex Smith. Thats how crucial it is
I dont believe Mariota will be a bust REGARDLESS who drafts him.....BUT, Situation will be critical for him to determine HOW GOOD will he be
Spoiler Alert: Tampa Bay Bucaneers select: FSU QB JAMEIS WINSTON. #BookIt
Im so freaking torn between channels. I KNOW @nflnetwork has better football grit. But I'm sooo used to @ESPN's coverage..&amp; they have GRUDEN
I do love Danny Shelton tho. Honestly
@RomoCop74 @bab1104 By the way, his name is CHRIS MORTENSON. If your gonna quote him atleast get it right
@Shannon_Penn @AGoldFan @joeovies Bro that was the UNDERRATED steal of the draft. Logan Zone had number 1 segment potential!
@Shannon_Penn @AGoldFan @joeovies is Dig of the day gone? We need a pick recap. Lol
@TheEsquireof212 @xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater &amp; if he did something wrong just cut him, no love lost.
@TheEsquireof212 @xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater ...And then just PRAY TO GOD, he had nothing to do with that terrible, unfortunate, incident.
@TheEsquireof212 @xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater It would be a savvy move to draft La'el Collins in the 7th round, if he starts to go undrafted
@TheEsquireof212 @xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater if he's as good as they say. Imo he has the ceiling to be, not Sure if he reaches it tho
@TheEsquireof212 @xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater Leon. Williams may actually be best player in the whole draft period. Regardless of position.
@TheEsquireof212 @xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater If Leonard Williams is a TRANSCENDENT guy the way they say, he's well worth moving for, imo
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater Also like Demarious Randle too. Safety from AZ St
@LogicalHater @xI_Usernamex Yea I do like Peat too &amp; would be cool with him. But also like Cam Earving way later, if we miss on Peat at LT
@NYSportzNut @JordanRaanan I love Melvin Gordon. But at 9? Nah.
@xI_Usernamex @LogicalHater @TheEsquireof212 Hopefully Leonard Williams or Fowler. If not them Scherff.
@RomoCop74 @bab1104 How bout u STOP listening to people &amp; jumping in with your argumentative 2¢ to every tweet &amp; just accept, U DON'T KNOW!
@bab1104 @RomoCop74  

Take your own advice Barb! Multiply X100 &amp; apply it 2 EVERYTHING that goes on today b4 draft 
@bab1104 @CJ_450 How bout u STOP listening to people &amp; jumping in with your argumentative 2¢ to every tweet &amp; just accept that U DON'T KNOW!
@CJ_450 @bab1104 It would also be different if Chip DIDN'T have final say in personnel. It would be another obstacle. But thats not the case
@CJ_450 @bab1104  If organization side wasn't 100% all in for THIS particular guy only then ya, I agree. It'd be different &amp; very difficult
@CJ_450 @bab1104 Both sides are willing &amp; Feelings are mutual. With the Giants it was different. Cuz they woulda took Ben &amp; been fine w/that
@CJ_450 @bab1104 In this case its unique. U have a top guy, who played for the coach who has ABSOLUTE POWER over personnel. They could do it
@CJ_450 @bab1104 You don't need an Archie. If the ORGANIZATION has a mutual feeling. The Giants were cool with sitting &amp; taking Big Ben.
@bab1104 Stop seriously. Just stop. If he wanted to he absolutely could BCAUSE Chip has absolute control&amp; the feeling is mutual,he wants him
@ESPN_Colin ...."I won't play for anybody but Chip Kelly." Then that would make it a whole lot easier for Chip to make this happen
@ESPN_Colin I know Mariota especially isn't the type to create &amp; shed a negative light on himself. But he should just make it easy &amp; say....
@ESPN_Colin I get Nobody wants to be "That guy" but if Mariota really wants to be with Chip &amp; it's mutual, then why doesn't he pull an Eli?
Its not in his personality 2 make a negative situation 4himself. But if Mariota wanted 2 help Chip draft him all hes gotta do is Pull an ELI
Look, If Mariota REALLY wants to play for Chip he can make this really Simple. Just take a stand &amp; say you won't play for anybody else.
@Geeeeemen You CAN'T compare it. Just like you can't compare the RG3 year to move up to 2 with this year's price. It wouldn't cost the same
@Geeeeemen Doubt that'd be the price. We would swap firsts &amp; they would get a second this year &amp; 2nd or 3rd next year
The only way a Guard or RT is worth a 9th pick. Is if the draft is just THAT THIN &amp; THERE'S NO BODY ELSE worth taking. Not the case this yr
I think Flowers could be a solid RT or Guard but that's why I dont want him at 9. If you're not a LT, you're not worth a 9th pick.
Lemme be clear tho. I don't like Ereck Flowers AS A LEFT TACKLE. I think he could be a solid NFL guard. But he's not gonna be versatile
@NYSportzNut I would love it
@RomoCop74 He's Will Beatty all over again. No thanks
If we target OL early &amp; miss out on Scherff/Peat, then take Cam Earving next round. Don't reach for Flowers
I dont want Ereck Flowers, no matter what! Keep him away from my team. He's the most overrated OT in this draft, CONSISTENTLY plays 2high
@bab1104  

 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy @975TheFanatic
So if Williams falls to 4 and we DO decide to move up &amp; draft him, I will have absolutely no problem with it. #NYG
Not gonna lie, thought of JPP, Jonathan Hankins, Moore, &amp; LEONARD WILLIAMS brings me back 2 the Giants superbowl runs! Thats our identity!
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Lol
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy  she might finally be really quiet today. Lol
@Chuck1one  I'd love to actually, watch him play, atleast a couple games to know a little. But yea I'll see the skill set
@Chuck1one Yea I'll check some out, but it's not the same as WATCHING him. Ya know? That's all highlights. Supposed to look good.
@Chuck1one I haven't Seen ANY of Muiday at ALL. So I can't compare
@Chuck1one How bout Deangelo Russell? We are gonna get youth, but I'll take Jack Too tho. We need depth
@Chuck1one He's better than Felton, Lin, Kidd, Chauncey, Shved, Calderon etc...
@Chuck1one You think Steve Francis was better than Jack?
@Chuck1one My point being, anybody in recent memory. It's been a while. He's better than any of the ones we've had lately. In the last 10yrs
@Chuck1one Yea but I'm saying the best since the last good one we had, no matter who was the last good one in anybodys opinion
@Chuck1one But yea I remember Harper, &amp; Later Childs. But I can't remember the last good one. Either way, U get my point tho...
@Chuck1one That's right. So then Jack would be the best since them, if they were the last good ones we had. If he played for the Knicks.
@Chuck1one He wasn't? Who was then, again? I always forget.
Is Jarrett Jack a free agent? The Knicks could soooo use him. He'd be the best point guard we've had since.........John Starks maybe?
A good sign for the Nets, they aren't Quitting
Korver has a serious ratchet
This game is highly entertaining, for it to be one that really isn't that close
Honestly, Jeff Teague is underrated as hell, in my opinion.....Which matters to no one, obviously. But I'm Just saying....

You all know I LOVE MARIOTA. I believe he will be the one who breaks the mold of making the transition to the NFL. But Winston is READY NOW!
If I was advising the Tampa Bay GM. My advice would be: KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. Don't talk yourself outta taking Jameis Winston. He's your QB
@x_colorrmepinkk LMFAO is that not funny? #BlueBell
I got no problem AT ALL w/ Drafting Scherff. I DO have a problem with drafting him at 9 OVERALL tho. I wish we would trade back a little 1st
It definitely has something to do with it

@RomoCop74 @bab1104 @alexpokerguy LOL
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Either way. I think he Likes Bradford. But I think he LOVES Mariota &amp; would dump Bradford in a heart beat for him
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 ..gets stuck w/him, hes STILL an upgrade over Foles, regardless. So it was a win, win. If He can deal him, better
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 I feel this was Chips thinking. I get Bradford cuz he's better than Foles, period. More trade value. BUT if he...
He wanted him BECAUSE he's better trade bait 

"@alexpokerguy: @Sum1UshouldNo @RomoCop74 Chip Kelly wanted Bradford... Hope that stays."
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Nobody wants A Gimp, even tho that gimp is better than all the QBs on the Eagles, Titans &amp; Browns roster COMBINED
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Not a chance guys! Not a chance! You heard that gas bag, Barb! Not One chance in the entire UNIVERSE! NOT A CHANCE!
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I dont underestimate Chips willingness to do WHATEVER it takes to get Mariota. But I dont think Browns help them
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I doubt the BROWNS would HELP Philly deal with Tennesse to get Philly the QB they actually want too
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I don't think that happens. But never know. I think it'll be a direct trade between Phi &amp; Tenn, if anything
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Heard all kinds of things. Heard Giants would trade up for Leonard Williams if he's there at 4.
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 @bab1104 Exactly.
@NYSportzNut  Can't be mad at that. I wouldn't be upset
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 @bab1104 EXACTLY &amp; Calling anything a pipe dream is just irresponsible thinking. Wreckless talking
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Makes sense.
@RomoCop74 @bab1104 @alexpokerguy &amp; he didnt even KNOW. He heard something, &amp; on a lucky hunch ran with it &amp; luckily he ended up being right
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Especially when it comes from Patricia Traina. She's a great REPORTER. Not a football expert... AT ALL
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy this is not my first draft. I've been watching football for 20 years. U can save your Pre Draft Advice
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Exactly. So take ur own advice &amp; dont listen to things being pipe dreams. It could happen. It may NOT tho
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy A WEDDING DRESS at that. &amp; End up on a cover of a magazine with him. So don't tell me about pipe dreams...
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Once saw a SB winning coach trade an entire draft 4 a Pot head Hippie RB, then put on a dress &amp; take Pics
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy I've seen MUCH CRAZIER things happen then that. MUCH
@bab1104 @RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Whatever you say Barb. Nothing is a sure thing. But ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. Don't kid yourself. U dont know
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Im not even ruling out Giants drafting Mariota if he fell 2them. Crazy as that sounds. McAdoo here, MM=Rodgers-like
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 So on &amp; so forth down the line, you get the idea. But ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. I'm ruling out NOTHING
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Then Raiders who were expected to take a WR, takes DT then Cooper is sitting there 4 the Jags. Who werent expecting
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 which could push Fowler down. But if Fowler goes then Williams gets pushed down. Either way.
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Which means TENNESSEE who woulda possibly took Williams 2 wont. Then hes there 4 Raiders who weren't expecting him
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74  Which then has it's own effect. Cuz then Tennessee who has SPECIFIC OTHER needs are removed from the picture.
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Don't worry about that. Bucs take Winston 1 &amp; Eagles are Definitely trading up to 2 for Mariota. Thats What I Think
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy ...fill that need later on, &amp; can't miss on BOTH guys, so they pull the trigger &amp; before u know it, Fowler is there
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy The next team needing a DT may now feel pressured to take Shelton with an earlier pick cuz they feel they can't....
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy Or risk missing out on that need altogether. If Williams &amp; Shelton are the best DTs &amp; Williams goes earlier then...
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 And a team takes one early. The next team might change their strategy thinking they are pressured to take the other
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 It's what I call the domino effect. If there's two guys that are far &amp; away better than rest at a given position...
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 But I've seen way crazier things than a guy slipping 6 spots. 2 QBs &amp; a couple OL, a WR, &amp; a DT then who knows
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Teams have needs that must be addressed. Like I said everybody has their guy in mind. I'm sure Fowler is on Radars
@alexpokerguy @RomoCop74 Bears desperately need an INTERIOR DT more than Fowler. Redskins maybe, who knows.
@NYSportzNut I really dont think we are taking a WR THAT EARLY, &amp; especially not TRADING UP for one. BUT who really knows
@NYSportzNut get two first round talents &amp; a top ten player
@NYSportzNut How about this for a scenario? Trade back, take Scherff or Collins get another late 1st out of it &amp; take Randy Gregory too.
@NYSportzNut I'm not buying Kevin White or Ereck Flowers. They're both overrated. Rather take Danny Shelton or Devante Parker
@NYSportzNut I'm gonna be pissed if that's the scenario. I would trade back &amp; take whoever is there between Collins or Scherff
@NYSportzNut This reminds me of the year we took Kenny Phillips. He was the only safety but that's the range I see Collins worth. Same spot
@NYSportzNut Collins is the best safety in this draft. Problem is this draft SUCKS at safety. But he's def. A first rounder. Not worth 9 tho
@NYSportzNut ....draft a guy like him, if Scherff is the pick then we better be trading back &amp; getting more picks before we take him
@NYSportzNut Scherff is a guy I like. He's a NASTY Guard, who could play tackle if asked, not his best position tho. But 9 is not where u...
@RomoCop74 @alexpokerguy U gotta think we pick 9, two of the picks are gonna be the QBs. So that's like picking 7th. So only 7 guys
@RomoCop74  I saw a guy, once trade his entire draft for a Pot head, hippie running back......
@RomoCop74 Me either on the surface, but watching the draft as long as I have, I've seen MUCH stranger things happen than that
@alexpokerguy Have u not seen stranger things happen in the draft than that? He would only have to slip a couple spots. We pick 9, not 19th
@alexpokerguy That may very well be the case but then again, how many teams drafting before us have bigger problems they must address first
I think the Giants like Dante Fowler more than they're letting on. Wouldn't shock me one bit if he was the pick at 9
I'm telling u Tennessee wants out of that pick &amp; Chip Kelly is getting up in that number 2 spot &amp; Mariota will be an Eagle. Bradford 2 Tenn

@Geeeeemen Either Chip, or if he goes anywhere else then the best situation would be somewhere he can go sit &amp; learn from an older Stud QB
@Geeeeemen Besides our team isn't the only great situation for him, Saints, Chargers, Giants, Eagles are all good situations for him
@Geeeeemen Besides I'm talking ATLEAST 4 yrs before he plays. He needs to sit &amp; watch Eli finish his career &amp; learn from him. Then his turn
@Geeeeemen Steve Young didn't push Montana out. The front office did. It's not the young QBs fault. It is what it is.
@Geeeeemen He wouldn't be the guy who pushes Eli out of town. Rodgers didn't push Favre out of town, GB's organization pushed Favre out.
@Geeeeemen It would be great for him &amp; for us. Eli could be our Favre &amp; he's our Rodgers. QB of the future
@Geeeeemen Agreed. I really dont think he'll be there. But I honestly wouldn't be upset AT ALL if he was &amp; we took him. Great situation 4him
Why its perfect? Mariota is exactly what Aaron Rodgers was coming outta college&amp; has that caliber of an NFL ceiling. McAdoo was part of that
Keep hearing QUIETLY that Giants are a wildcard to draft Marcus Mariota. I dont think its smokescreen either. Wit McAdoo here its so perfect
I swear to you. The Browns just love screwing up a young mans career &amp; football future if he plays QB. They always wanna get their hands on

@SeniorBowlPhil @Dan_Hatman @Giants True. But if I remember correctly Spaggs safeties are mostly over the top coverage guys. But of course..
@SeniorBowlPhil @Dan_Hatman @Giants I agree. Collins is a very solid Safety. Good instincts. But Randle seems like he fits Spaggs Defense
@SeniorBowlPhil @Giants Maybe Neither 1 of those guys is REALLY that good. So why not try &amp; take best available at 9, then see whats left
@SeniorBowlPhil @Giants True, I totally get what you're saying, but maybe the buzz is because the class is so thin at the position.
@Dan_Hatman @SeniorBowlPhil @Giants Isn't there some1 worth taking @ 9 better than Collins later? Is Landon THAT MUCH better than Randle?
@Dan_Hatman @SeniorBowlPhil @Giants Totally agree with it being maybe the biggest hole @ a position on ANY team. BUT Is that move necessary?

I don't understand.........How did Raymond Felton "earn" the starting PG job as the 3rd string &amp; JJ Barea been playing well? How?
Great! except he better plan on increasing the $. Healthy food COSTS!

"@HuffingtonPost governor wants to ban buying junk food w food stamps
@xI_Usernamex Not just losses but double it cuz they all went to division rivals. So a double negative for them
I think George Selvie &amp; Dwayne Harris are gonna be much bigger losses 4 the Cowboys then they actually realize. Not 2 mention Demarco Murray

I'm not sure but I think Josh Smith just became the PG by default of the Houston Rockets
@NYGreenMachine  @AverageBroCo ....but that's who we need. Somebody like that
@NYGreenMachine @AverageBroCo Kyrie Irving might be my favorite player in the league. Definitely my fav PG. IDK if Russell is that, but...
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine Deangelo Russell could maybe be that guy. Who knows. I don't
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine young or old, doesn't matter. Kyrie Irving woulda been the PERFECT GUY. Ideal fit. But he's not leaving now
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine It HAS 2B a guy who Melo respects his game as a decision maker &amp; player &amp; a guy who don't need Melo 2 succeed.
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine It really doesn't have to be a veteran man. It can be a young dude. But it HAS to be a mature one who can play
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine ....for them to play well tho. Cuz that's where the problem is. Give him self motivators who know how to PLAY
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine He can play just fine if he has some help&amp; talent around him. He CAN'T have OTHER guys who depend on him 2lead
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine Melo doesn't need a leader to play. He just doesn't need guys around him who look to him for leadership
@AverageBroCo @NYGreenMachine @nyknicks Oh so in other words, GIVE HIM A POINT GUARD. Yea that makes sense. Hasn't had one of those either
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks ...He dont have the time&amp; hes got LeBron in his ear. Give him 1 OFF season away from the team. He'll find trouble.
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks JR will atleast need ONE OFF season In Cleveland to get mixed up with the wrong crowd &amp; find trouble. Right now...
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks Atleast. I feel they will be able to hold his attention span for ATLEAST the rest of this run they're on.
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks Doubt it. As long as hes in that city with that team around him, he will remain focused 4 the rest of THIS season
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks was asked, &amp; WOULD NOT give endorsement&amp; say that he supported bringing him in. Said he didn't think we needed him
Sure did. A long time ago. It was when JR came back from China

"@NYGreenMachine: @nyknicks he did?!? Hmmmm interesting I can't recall."
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks We dont need to bring in troubled, immature, low character guys &amp; deal with them 2succeed. We can win WITHOUT them
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks ....Let other teams do the babysitting. We should only bring in GROWN UPS &amp; Mature guys who motivate themselves
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks ...That's my point. We shouldn't be bringing in CHILDREN who need that to play well. They shouldn't be playing 4Us
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks Wait a minute bro, I'm not saying I didn't know Melo wasn't like that. Everybody knows he's not that dude. BUT....
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks ....us to SIGN JR IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHEN ASKED. Melo knew this too. He never wanted JR
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks I understand that &amp; knew it when we got him. As a matter of fact I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER Melo saying he DIDN'T WANT
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks I'm done with guys like that. U said it best, THEY'RE CHILDREN. Got no business being paid to play ball. Pathetic!
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks That's Pathetic. Man, if you need that much "discipline" from another grown man to play your best, GET OFF MY TEAM
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks Winning &amp; playing your best with every opportunity u have should be all the motivation you need. He's a grown man!
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks ....kind of BS is that, really? Like why would we even want somebody like that on our team in the first place?
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks ...to be "held accountable" by other PROFESSIONALS to make sure they're bringing 100% on any given night? WTF....
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks We all know Melo is not LeBron on any level whatsoever. But should that really matter? Do we want guys that NEED..
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks The fact people even point to Melo not being the leader LeBron is for why there's a difference in JR is ABSURD
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks @TheRealJRSmith Its not Melo or anybody else's responsibility to hold you accountable to give it ur all. PATHETIC!
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks @TheRealJRSmith Grow the hell up &amp; be a professional. Ur getting Over paid to play &amp;couldn't do it without "Daddy"
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks @TheRealJRSmith This is why I hate you, JR. Gotta be baby sat &amp; have a Father figure on the team to get u to play
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks @TheRealJRSmith How can you let another grown man dictate the way you play. Its just a TEAMMATE. Be a professional
@NYGreenMachine @nyknicks @TheRealJRSmith BS. That's the weakest excuse ever. What are you a child who needs a father? Ur a GROWN MAN.
@EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Chris_Whelan7 @Capace17 But if I had to choose ONE it would be C because it fills the most needs &amp; its BPA

@EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Chris_Whelan7 @Capace17 ...drafting, mixed with filling needs too. Good combo of Best player &amp; need too
@EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Chris_Whelan7 @Capace17 Much Rather take C. Demarious Randall, Hardy, Tomlinson that's solid late round...
@TheRealJRSmith The fact he half ass gave us barely ANY of that his whole NYK career. But was capable of this level of play the entire time?
I hope @TheRealJRSmith understands why us Knicks fans hate him now. Look how hard he goes every night on the Cavs. Look what he gives THEM!
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 Compared to taking Kevin White, absolutely Cooper would b a no brainer. Diff level
@Chris_Whelan7 @EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 are still there
@Chris_Whelan7 @EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 I think it's time to address defense or offensive line if one of the best players
@Chris_Whelan7 @EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 ...the best WR this yr. But honestly I dont even WANT to take a WR first this year
@Chris_Whelan7 @EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 IDK bro, honestly I might even rather have Devante Parker. I think he could be....
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 No brainer I'm taking Hardy later on. That's an easy choice for me
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 If my options are Blow the 9th pick on White, or STEAL Hardy in the 3rd-4th Rd....
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 yea his speed is above average. But idk why he's rated so much better than Hardy
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 Whites intangibles are average if I'm being generous. Don't get why he's hyped
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 He's over hyped. Devante Parker is atleast 3Xs better a WR than White is.
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 cuz he's not really that special honestly. Hands are suspect, routes are average
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 I think Justin Hardy is every bit as good a WR that White is &amp; a much better value
@EveryoneHates_I @Chris_Whelan7 @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 I dont really want Kevin White, I think hes really most overrated WR in draft wise
@Chris_Whelan7 @EveryoneHates_I @FelixDavila804 @Capace17 @SCrociata A,C,D would be good. I wanna combine a few of them as usual

@NW_503 ....couldn't help it. Like I never saw it as one of those things you could either do or couldn't. I always thought it was just lack
@NW_503 But see that's exactly why I didn't get it. BCUZ to me, free throws are one of those things that isn't something that guys JUST.....
@NW_503  Please explain......
Like if you're one of these guys that opposing coaches do "Hack-a-player" on &amp; it's THAT BIG of a flaw that it's exploited like that, HOW?
You get paid to play basketball, how do you NOT spend enough time to effectively correct that problem? Especially if it's a serious flaw

@NicolasRetana @MikeSpeBioch Frank REPEATEDLY deferred 2his teammates time &amp; time again, instead of being aggressive &amp; driving/drawing fouls
@NicolasRetana @MikeSpeBioch How about blaming Kaminsky for playing timid &amp; passive all game when he clearly had the ability to take over?
@NicolasRetana @MikeSpeBioch Well, it went both ways all those phantom calls on Okafor when he CLEARLY swatted all ball. That wasn't right
@MikeSpeBioch @NicolasRetana ..ur teams poor defense blowing a 15 point lead &amp; allowing a kid like Grayson Allen to singlehandedly take over
@MikeSpeBioch @NicolasRetana ....that's a Wisconsin problem &amp; that means they should have played better. The refs weren't responsible for...
@MikeSpeBioch @NicolasRetana If your team allowed a team like Duke to keep hanging around &amp; allowed one call to be THAT BIG of a factor then
@MikeSpeBioch @NicolasRetana ONE CALL doesn't decide a game. Can't blame it on that. Blame yourselves for not playing better all around
@MikeSpeBioch @NicolasRetana That was my point. Nick was specifically pointing out that they "Screwed Wisconsin" &amp;with that point I DISAGREE
@MikeSpeBioch @NicolasRetana Now if THAT'S the point then, that's fair. It's understood the officiating was horrendous. But it wasn't BIASED
@NicolasRetana Its Part of the game, both teams go thru it, its fair 4both. That excuse is WEAK. Just take the loss &amp; accept Duke was better
Don't wanna hear that, its  weak. Refs gave Wisconsin the game VS UK, sooo

"@NicolasRetana: @Sum1UshouldNo those refs gave Duke the game."
@Dev5Dombrowski Ohhh. Ok. Well thanks for taking time to explain that. It gets a little confusing. Threw me off for a second. Lol
@Dev5Dombrowski Ahh. Ok now I kinda understand. It is, but they have separate standards for the Student Athletes? I thought every school did
@Dev5Dombrowski  It was the perception for sure. But I guess recent numbers dont lie
@Dev5Dombrowski I've always associated Duke with being a prestigious type School. I thought it earned that type of reputation thru academics
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ They'd probably STILL go to Duke &amp; Kentucky if they were a top talent. Coach K &amp; Calipari &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bo Ryan.
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ I just feel, even IF Wisc. Could recruit whoever they wanted, those guys wouldn't go there anyway.
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ Had no idea Wisc. was one of those. I thought Duke was. Like Notre Dame &amp; Stanford. Guess I had it backwards
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ Right, but I thought every school had a little bit of that. Just some more strict on it than others.
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ I just always perceived Duke as one of those schools that had top notch standards too. Must've been mistaken
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ Not saying you're wrong. I just honestly thought that Duke was especially that way too.
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ I thought Duke had some of the highest standards next to Stanford, ND &amp; schools like that. Wisconsin higher?
@Dev5Dombrowski @Isaiah________ Bro, Did you just say Wisconsin had high academic standards? Compared to.......DUKE?! Thought Duke was topps
#NCAAChampionship #Duke 
@Isaiah________ @Dev5Dombrowski He doesn't do Rent-a-player because he CAN'T. Not because he chooses not to. He's an idiot
@Isaiah________ @Dev5Dombrowski As if that's HIS decision. Those players dont wanna be coached by Bo Ryan. Or play in Wisconsin.
@NicolasRetana Their CEILING is Duke &amp; Kentucky's floor. Their STARTING POINT. That's the talent gap. Bo CAN'T GET those kinds of kids
@NicolasRetana Took Bo Ryan 4years to turn those kids into the types of players that Duke&amp; Kentuckys FRESHMAN START OUT as. Different levels
@NicolasRetana Those dudes are good talents too. Good recruiting. But there's no comparison to them &amp; players that Duke &amp; Kentucky have

@NicolasRetana lmao, as if. None of those types of talented kids are knocking down Bo Ryans door. He's LUCKY to get Kaminsky, honestly
@NicolasRetana Kaminsky is fantastic. Just saying. Bo Ryan is an idiot for trying to make it seem like it's HIS choice NOT to recruit them
"I dont rent players cuz they were all just lined up begging to go to Wisconsin&amp; I said, NO, I dont roll that way BECAUSE I'M BO RYAN" IDIOT
Bo Ryan doesn't do Rent-a-player, guys. He wants u to know that. Cuz CLEARLY it's HIS CHOICE to NOT have the best talent in the country. LOL
@Ibleedblue2122 @Isaiah________ I'm with you bro. DUMBEST argument in sports hands down
@NicolasRetana NONE of those types of guys are dying to play for Bo Ryan. That's why he doesn't do Rent-a-player. It's not by choice. Smh
@NicolasRetana You have to be a special kind of talent to be a one &amp; done player then also translate that talent to production on court
@NicolasRetana Not taking anything away from Kaminsky he's great. But he was referencing ONE &amp; DONE players. Of which Bo has none, because..
@NicolasRetana Oh so Kaminsky jumped in a time machine &amp; became a freshman again? Yea.... may wanna rethink this &amp; try your tweet over again
@Ibleedblue2122 @Isaiah________ Absolutely not &amp; they ABSOLUTELY SHOULDN'T take credit away from Calipari either. They really deserve EXTRA!
We don't do rent-a-player? Really Bo Ryan? I think what you meant to say was, NOBODY who has special one of a kind talent wants to play 4 u!

That might've been a smart foul actually. No 3s now
Aaron Harrison time?
Uh.....ohhhhh!
These guys are relentless, resilient, unwavering, ice cold #UK
I'm with these announcers. I'm not seeing these fouls their calling
@Isaiah________ But to your point I think Aaron is the better shooter. But Andrew the slasher/driver &amp; passer as a PG. Sound about right?
@Isaiah________ But then this year's tournament rolls around &amp; Andrew impresses enough to make you kinda revisit the analysis of them both
@Isaiah________ I also probably agree with what u said. But I'd also add its like the Tale of 2 season's. Last yr no question It was Aaron..
@Isaiah________ you watch much more Kentucky basketball than me so I defer to u &amp; respect your opinion.
Well, Watchu think?

"@Isaiah________: @Sum1UshouldNo I'll answer this at the half lol"
Fair enough Sir. I understand 

"@Isaiah________: @Sum1UshouldNo I'll answer this at the half lol"
@Isaiah________   

Aaron or Andrew in your opinion &amp; why? Also in your mind what's the major difference between the two?
Aaron Stepped up LAST YEAR in the tournament with his pure clutch shot making ability. But THIS YEAR it's Andrew with his slashing &amp; driving
Tough Decisions:  

Who's better? Aaron Harrison (number 2) or....
Andrew Harrison? (Number 5) it's really a puzzling one for me.

@Chris_Whelan7 ......then fail &amp; come back to college with Syracuse....who knows, that's my dream scenario. Lmao
@Chris_Whelan7 I'm hoping we can pull off like getting a Shaka Smart or somebody atleast. That'd be great. Maybe Calipari will go pro again
@Chris_Whelan7 We will be treading water for ATLEAST 5yrs. Boeiheim is gonna have to go &amp; we are gonna have to hit a home run with next hire

@Chris_Whelan7 Kansas is irrelevant now but even they pulled off a Wiggins &amp; Embiid recruitment one year. Duke pulled off Okafor. UNC???
@Chris_Whelan7 Now ur seeing what I mean about it. Duke gets everybody that Kentucky doesn't. But UNC HAS GOTTA PULL OFF SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY
@Chris_Whelan7 Thats Exactly my point. Even Kansas has been able to pull off an occasional Andrew Wiggins recruit. UNC NEEDS to do something
@Isaiah________  Completely dominant so far.
@Chris_Whelan7 I mean EVERY1 losing recruits 2 Coach Cal. But Duke plucked 1 or 2 McDonalds All American # 1-3 players in country, atleast
@Chris_Whelan7 ....ruined his draft stock completely by having a horrible 2nd year. So IDK if you can even count him as a REAL star guy
@Chris_Whelan7 I GUESS you could say Harrison Barnes...but he kinda fell off as his career went on. Had a great 1st year, came back &amp; almost
@Chris_Whelan7 It's been even longer since he even had one of those real STAR Type players to identify with. Who was the last? Hansborough?
@Chris_Whelan7 I understand that, but I mean how long is his leash? How long before those dont hold weight anymore? Been a while since...&amp;..
You would THINK Roy would atleast have to do a flawless coaching job with the recruits he does get to stay employed at UNC, but not really
Being at a prestigious university with basketball history&amp; championship expectations, I dont understand how Roy Williams keeps his job @ UNC
Its 1 thing if ur not getting top tier recruits. But if u can get decent enough ones &amp; coach them to play GREAT, that's acceptable. Roy dont
So how long until #UNC gets tired of Roy Williams &amp; his mediocrity. Doesn't get the top tier recruits. Doesn't coach up the ones he does get
@BeauxJaxson @buyleanandweed @desusnice @ArianFoster That's gotta either be a joke, or a setup. Gotta be kidding me. Lol

@TDGawd little of both, maybe?

So I keep hearing: "NO WAY" MGasol leaves Memphis. But NOBODY gives me a GOOD reason why. They act like the Spanish native is from Tennessee
@RomoCop74 @RVacchianoNYDN So there's actually a few other REAL reasons besides he just went to Oregon. Lol
@RomoCop74 @RVacchianoNYDN This one actually does make some logical sense tho. Played in the div..., hes a system player that fits. Need LBs
@RomoCop74 @RVacchianoNYDN Ur spot on. That was hypocritical of me. I fell victim to habit. Im So used 2 hearing it now, I felt it necessary
@RomoCop74 @RVacchianoNYDN Matter of fact. It's the last time Paysinger was GOOD at football was when he was playing beside Kiko Alonzo
@RomoCop74 @RVacchianoNYDN It's been so long ago I think people forgot he went there. Besides Chip still needs Linebackers &amp; he does fit...
@RomoCop74 @RVacchianoNYDN I figured I would go ahead &amp; get it out of the way because somebody was gonna do it anyway! Lol
@RVacchianoNYDN Betcha he works out for the Eagles
Darren Sharper got 9 years for ONE of those charges &amp; he has like 4 or 5 different charges in different states. Yea he's pretty much done.
@AaronNagler Give Cam SOMETHING for crying out loud
@RomoCop74 agreed but there's so many teams who actually need a QB where he could help. But then again the Jets where that too, didn't help
@DraftDiamonds not necessarily, there's always FullBack

@MrRuiz81 He should take all our positions of NEED, separate them, then take the best player available out of those positions only
@MrRuiz81 TOTALLY AGREE. Especially since this draft is also deep at WR again 4 the 2nd yr in a row. Can find quality WRs at a value, later!
@MrRuiz81 We screw this draft up, &amp; it's gonna make this offseason 10x more horrible than it already is. We cannot afford a mediocre draft

"@LeoKikiLady89: If people are getting 5, you're subtracting before you add..."
@LeoKikiLady89 .....FINAL ANSWER. haha
@LeoKikiLady89 Right. That's what I was just looking at. I put subtraction over addition at the end. So 7 it is. I'm with ya
@LeoKikiLady89 But could also be 7 depending on if you honor the "+" or the "-" at the end of the equation
@LeoKikiLady89 So going by that which is how you're supposed to (credit to you for reminding me) I got 5 now
@LeoKikiLady89 Right. Well there's no parenthesis or Exponents. So there's a start. Lol next is multiply &amp; divide.
@LeoKikiLady89 That's how I got 1. But like I said, its probably ALL wrong.
@LeoKikiLady89 I just basically did it left to right. 6-1 = 5. Times zero is zero. So essentially it comes down to 2 divided by 2 which is 1
@LeoKikiLady89 Well I'm almost CERTAINLY WRONG. First of all. Let's just make that clear from the jump. Lol

@The_DC_Unit  I woulda preferred giving somebody like him an opportunity to prove himself over drafting one or signing an older Veteran etc.
@The_DC_Unit  Me being a Giants fan tho, I just really liked idea of bringing him in cuz of how weak the free agent &amp; draft class is at S
@The_DC_Unit  What I like about him, is his potential. Just projecting what I think his capabilities could produce w/an opportunity to start
@The_DC_Unit ....saw his progress playing in the NFL in that system with that kinda talent around him. It helped him big time.

@Red_Epidermis Thanks man, that would be a dream come true. People have told me that before. I wouldn't even know where to start. Also....
@Red_Epidermis He wants 2 see if they're still injury prone in HIS system. If so then he can judge them as Injury prone. If not, its a steal
@Red_Epidermis That's why he's not worried about the injury history of all the players he's brought in. He believes in his program.
@Red_Epidermis Just calling it like I see it, bro. I analyze objectively to the best of my knowledge &amp; try to use as much sense as possible
@Red_Epidermis Its proven to be effective too. Yr in, yr out, hes had the least players on IR of any team in any league hes ever coached in
@Red_Epidermis .all the way to eating, to yoga, to special LEGAL supplements that other teams dont do. Hopefully it'll help his injury probs
@Red_Epidermis ...strength &amp; conditioning staff &amp; is on the cutting edge of injury preventive methods that seem 2B working. From stretching
@Red_Epidermis Hes fortunate enough now to be in a system that will help &amp; with an innovative, progressive coach who has a state of the art
@Red_Epidermis Sam Bradford is up there with like Matt Ryan (PHYSICAL TALENT WISE ALONE) in terms of his skill set. Just never healthy
@Red_Epidermis Bradford has more natural talent than Andy Dalton too. Plain &amp; Simple.
@Red_Epidermis And he's been healthy. Where as Bradford has been hurt year after year. But TALENT WISE alone. Bradford is better than Foles
@Red_Epidermis Now Foles has been more successful cuz he was fortune enough to have Chip Kelly &amp; loads more talent around him in his offense
@Red_Epidermis I think hes a MUCH MORE TALENTED QB than Foles ever was, regardless what happens. If he gets Mariota or NOT he UPGRADED AT QB
@Red_Epidermis But I also believe hes set himself up to the point, if it ends up costing too much, he'd be just as happy NOT making the move
@Red_Epidermis Oh yea. Mariota is the plan. IDC what Chip hinted at publicly. He never said he WASN'T going to do it. He's planning it

@Chris_Whelan7 On a positive note Tho. It DOES WORK THAT WAY with HIRING COACHES. We'll have Cream of the Crop caliber candidates to choose
@Chris_Whelan7 It's like they say in college. Don't pick a school BECAUSE OF A COACH.
@Chris_Whelan7 ....patterns of smart decision making. But it doesn't work like that with players. It's all about money &amp; Coaches. All wrong
@Chris_Whelan7 ....AND COORDINATORS for that matter. They should trust the organization's decisions for the future. Cuz they've shown good..
@Chris_Whelan7 ...behavior &amp; track record. Giants are a 1st class organization. They have a proven track record of Hiring successful coaches
@Chris_Whelan7 Thats what I'm saying. But see IMO they're looking at it wrong. Should make decisions based on pattern of ORGANIZATIONAL.....
@Chris_Whelan7 They want stability, they want security. Wanna be assured of sticking around &amp; not worrying about a new coach cleaning house
@Chris_Whelan7 The Coughlin situation. The 70 y.o. coach on essentially a 1yr deal is "supposedly" scaring the free agents away. &amp; I get it

@Isaiah________ Yea IF HE leaves. Is that cool with you? Cuz I would totally take him in RD2
@Isaiah________ Can the Knicks have him in the second round please?
@Chris_Whelan7 ....." Would be irrelevant. Cuz we wouldn't need these guys or care if they wanted to come or not.
@Chris_Whelan7 Had he drafted better we wouldn't even be CHASING OVER PRICED RECYCLED PLAYERS IN THE FIRST PLACE. The "attractive situation
@Chris_Whelan7 IMO Blame &amp; finger pointing should be at Reese for his MISERABLE QUALITY of draft substance. That's what put us IN THIS MESS
@Chris_Whelan7 IMO, there's blame to point at Reese. He DOES NOT get a pass. But in my opinion it's NOT FOR THIS
Playing for a 70 y.o. coach who is on a ONE year deal is a turn off for some guys. It's reality. BUT they should have faith in Organization!
You can Bash all you want. But if theres truth to it, &amp; Reese pursued these guys &amp; they decided to play elsewhere, is that REALLY his fault?
Not giving Reese a pass tho, his drafting is Y we have to try to lure free agents here. But at the end of the day, GUYS HAVE TO WANT to come
....The Coughlin 1yr deal situation, actually turned off a lot of potential guys landing here. We forget that it's not a ONE SIDED DECISION!
I actually heard from multiple sources that the Giants front office attempted to be aggressive in signing Free Agents to fill holes....BUT..
Kentucky is NASTY! The basketball team that is........well no actually its nasty in both aspects of life. Lol
@RomoCop74 Thats why I think its important he goes to Chip Kelly for familiarity &amp; help coping with the transition. But I really do like him
@RomoCop74  Sometimes I really worry that the stage may be a little too big for the small town kid from Hawaii. I really hope I'm wrong tho
@RomoCop74 I love the Kid for his Eli/Joe Flacco type demeanor &amp; the ice water in his veins he shows at times. But it's not consistent
@RomoCop74  He has the skills to be Aaron Rodgers &amp; has shown clutch gene. But the lights just seem a little to bright for him sometimes
John Calipari is a boss. I dont care. I hope @UKCoachCalipari is the next Syracuse coach honestly. As a fellow Italian, 1of my favorite guys

@UncleGusNyc It was around the time all his drama was going on tho. He had some shit going on in his life &amp; was probably just in a bad mood
@UncleGusNyc well then I said, if the football was a lemon loaf he would never take his hands off it. Lmao
@KristinFerrara_ LOL
@UncleGusNyc ....he would probably catch more TDs. Lol
@UncleGusNyc A while back he dropped a pass in Miami or something &amp; tweeted at him that if they put a Starbucks in the back of the endzone..
@KristinFerrara_  He did say that......BUT he never said WHAT PLAYOFFS. Like maybe 2017?
I see sarcasm doesn't translate well.  

"@KristinFerrara_: @Sum1UshouldNo he said they were making the playoffs"
Lmao funny story.  

"@UncleGusNyc: @Sum1UshouldNo Lmaoooooo!!!' Why Mike???"
@KristinFerrara_ IMAGINE IF HE WAS SERIOUS....... Wow.
@KristinFerrara_ Lol I know I was just messing with you. Anyway I was being serious. Phil intended on tanking &amp; did a marvelous job. Lol
@KristinFerrara_ Riiiiiight. Well aren't you special? Now I'm offended. I dont tweet to entertain people who think they're better than me.
@UncleGusNyc .....being searched for by amusement park security. Lmao
@UncleGusNyc But that was hilarious. I can just see him looking like a big dumb ass kid eating that Candy apple while his kids are .....???
@UncleGusNyc  Actually I'm blocked by him.....lmao.
Whaaaaaaat

The Jets already have a Project &amp; young QB they can work on molding. Get somebody to play RIGHT NOW. Dont start over with Mariota &amp; ruin him
Jets need to find the right mix. Same way The Cardinals did. Find a coach (they did) &amp;get him a guy like Carson Palmer who can already play!
I'm not saying the Jets dont need a QB, I mean, it's obvious they do. But they need a VETERAN! A low maintenance, functional QB.

@Domo_LXXXVI @velazquez46_d @incarceratedbob To be completely honest. Oregon offense is much more pro these days than people wanna admit
@velazquez46_d @Domo_LXXXVI @incarceratedbob Yea I dont get the Mariota/RG3 comparisons at all. Mariota is much more Russell Wilson
@Domo_LXXXVI @incarceratedbob They are not even close 2 the same player. I dont understand the comparison. Mariota is much more Russ Wilson
No it wasn't. Well not by me anyway. Mariota is no RG3

"@Domo_LXXXVI: @Sum1UshouldNo @incarceratedbob wasn't this said about RG3 too?"
@Ryan_McCrystal Exactly why he stayed with the Chiefs. Nobody else was paying him that. Especially not the lowballing Giants
@incarceratedbob That's exactly what his ceiling is too. In the right situation he will be Aaron Rodgers
@JordanRaanan I personally think we should give Jeron Johnson from Seattle a try. Probably the best option out there besides Delmas.
LMFAO lol. For real tho  

"@AthIeticWants: Kyrie Irving out there like... 
Forgot all these safeties were out there

"@PFF_Pete: Dawan Landry, Dwight Lowery, Kendrick Lewis, Louis Delmas all solid S options.
@Giants5john He's kind of a decent option too
@Giants5john I like Johnson. But guess what @PFF_Pete just brought to my attention? Dawan Landry is out there 2. The 1 who isnt on steroids
@PFF_Pete He was solid in spots
@PFF_Pete How about Jeron Johnson. Is that an option for the Giants? Dawan Landry is decent too. Always thought Johnson played solid in SEA
@PFF_Pete Even if they live up to those contracts, it's not like those fans would know the difference
@Giants5john Jeron Johnson. I'd still put him up there. We need both safeties

@FreddyJ_23 @BigBlueHuddle Besides he's not exactly a great tackler. It would make no sense at all. Then we would have a hole at CB instead
@FreddyJ_23 @BigBlueHuddle  I mean. Sure Prince would do ok at FS. Except he's an exceptional CB &amp; it would fix one hole by making another
@FreddyJ_23 @BigBlueHuddle Dumbest idea yet.

@KentSterling It is the Colts who are the ones who should legitimately file a grievance against Richardson to get their money back!
@KentSterling They gave up assets 4 him, completely embraced him &amp; he totally &amp; utterly let the colts down &amp; basically spit in their face
@KentSterling He had NO EXCUSE 4 his Colts tenure to turn out the way it did. Everything was set up for him to succeed. They gambled on him
@KentSterling COMPLETELY &amp; Whole HEARTEDLY agree. Can't believe the NFL even has to entertain the idea of a grievance from Trent Richardson.
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush For MY MONEY....he's done. We shall see. I bet he don't start or last
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Thought he was done. Plus we shall see about his health
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush I had no idea. In that case we shoulda gave him a chance. I didn't know.
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Get the freak outta here. Seriously? Kenny Phillips? On the saints? Wow
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush tell me he signed with the saints?
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Who does in new Orleans? Kenny Phillips? He's out of the league bro
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush His knees wouldn't last two games. Maybe 2 quarters if that
@TagMyJPP @Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush I was kinda thinking about that myself but he's ALL THE WAY DONE bro.
@Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ...way more valuable &amp; coveted. Better fit. But we need both Safeties anyway
@Giants5john @DennySpaleta @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Cooper Taylor, pretty Rangy. But I understand what u mean. Guys that can do both are..
Lol. Well played.

"@BestProAdvice: 
@DennySpaleta @Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush I mean I dont see Cooper Taylor as a Strong &amp; neither is Stevie Brown&amp; Landon is young
@RDanaFox Except he played w Giants last yr when they switched &amp; he played solid in spots at Guard. I think there were other issues in Mia
IDGAF MAN Kyrie Irving is freaking SICK
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush It's as open a competition as it can get. If anybody wants it bad enough it's there for the taking
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush We shall see
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush EVERYBODY. AND ANYBODY who wants to win the job, better get competing for it! Lol
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush you're probably right. But I personally have never heard of the guy. But yea if he's there, him too!
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Gordon?
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Let them put it all out there in camp &amp; fight for the job.
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ...we have already on the roster. Cooper Taylor, Nate Berhe, maybe slide Bennett Jackson in to FS
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ESPECIALLY the young ones. That's WHY I'm doing it that way. To get the best out of them &amp; see what
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush This way we cover on all basis &amp; then let them all go at it in camp &amp; compete 2 start. Best man win
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Well yea. Bring back Stevie, Bring in somebody like Jeron Johnson,&amp; then Draft Collins we'll be good
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush That's what I'm saying Collins is just about it. That's why I think we should bring in &amp; draft a guy
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ....the Free agent class is WEAKER. Landon Collins maybe the only decent one.
@Giants5john @JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush That's the problem. It's a terrible year for Safeties all the way around. The draft class is weak &amp;
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 I always thought Jackson was more a Safety than a CB anyway. Was drafted late at CB. But seemed better fit at FS
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Heres another thing. Maybe Bennett Jackson from ND that they drafted last year gets moved to safety. Seems to fit
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 I was actually in favor of bringing in Brandon Browner &amp; having him make the switch to safety.
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Berhe &amp; Cooper Taylor will have their opportunity to step into starting roles. Maybe Draft Landon Collins?
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 If not Jeron Johnson, Why not call New Orleans &amp; see what they want for Vaccarro? They are in fire sale mode
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush No parker for me, only available FA safety out there right now I would take a flier on is Jeron Johnson from SEA
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 as good as McCourty could be nobody in this league outside of QB is worth over paying for he's replaceable
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 McCourty woulda been nice, but Reese had his price &amp; wasn't going to come off it, he's a hard ball negotiator
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Im not settling 4 anybody. I'd just rather draft the type of guys ur talking about instead of signing them as FAs
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 That's what's most important. Free agents are icing, man. The draft picks are the damn CAKE. WE NEED MORE CAKE.
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 We wouldn't be crying about not having talent or not over paying recycled players if we did better in the draft
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 ...when u REALLY NEED to start focusing on this draft coming up &amp; pray to God Reese nails every single pick in it
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Besides you're worried about the wrong things. Sitting here complaining about not signing other teams trash...
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 ....turn it around &amp; get back on track. They've got a proven track record. If it doesn't happen they'll be gone
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 We will get it right. It may take longer than u want it to, but this regime has proven if given enough time will
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Besides every GM makes mistakes. Sometimes theres real explanations for why things dont work. Others are mistakes
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Well that yr we signed Myers was a stop gap until Donnell was ready. I think they intended on keeping Bennett too
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush NFC IS DEEP MAN. Not every team that deserves to get in will get in. Face it. If we dont win division, who knows
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 The fact it's ur opinion That's all we needed to make the playoffs is ridiculous. We could be fully loaded &amp; miss
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 THAT'S COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS BRO. That's not all they needed. We just went thru an ENTIRE REBUILD. 4yrs is nothing
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush I understand players are in &amp; out. But if the Patriots can maintain a level of consistency we should be able too
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Man WE NEED TO PLAY BETTER, PERIOD. We've ALL seen what this era team is capable of when they're focused&amp; rolling
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 No, GMen lack consistency. SOME talent is there. BUT it RARELY plays up to it's potential on a week in, week out
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush We definitely filled a LONG TIME HOLE in the return game. Needed a guy like Harris a LONG long time ago
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ...The guys on this team already DON'T PLAY BETTER. SPECIFICALLY OUR QUARTERBACK. Our Defense. Rookies. Everybody
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush My point is man. You're missing the point. Adding a bunch of expensive overrated guys isn't going to help if....
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Agree with Harris &amp; Vereen. Great additions IMO
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Our Line has to PROTECT HIM so that he can do that. Randle has 2B consistent. DaMontre Moore HAS TO make progress
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Our young guys GOTTA STEP UP &amp; PLAY BETTER. Our QB has gotta get more comfortable &amp; start playing like a 2x Champ
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 Improving on 6-10 has nothing to do with the guys we signed. Everything to do with who we have PLAYING BETTER
@NYGiantsRush @JoelEckert1 UR right it's not. Because it NEVER WAS in the first place. Improving on 6-10 depends on the players ALREADY HERE
@NYGiantsRush Detroit? They aren't even as good as Arizona. They dont belong on your little list, imo. I think we can hang with them. AZ no
@NYGiantsRush Seattle? I mean name another team in this ENTIRE LEAGUE THATS AS GOOD AS THEY ARE. There ISN'T ONE. But they lost the SB to NE
@NYGiantsRush Philly certainly made moves,&amp;I happen to believe in Chip Kelly. Always have. But C'mon man u have no idea if they stay healthy
@NYGiantsRush GB just happens to have an AMAZING QB. Take him off that team, is that roster REALLY THAT MUCH BETTER? NO
@NYGiantsRush I happen to think our Roster is as good as DallASS or GB just not in specific areas. DallASS D over achieved. No talent on it
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush RELAX
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ..will fair once the games are played. So bashing the lack of moves is a bit pre-mature. We haven't even drafted
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush It was very similar to what ur saying now. Truth of the matter is. YOU or anybody else don't know how this team..
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush ...went on an amazing run to win another championship. But if u go back &amp; look at fan reaction before that season
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush We didn't panic or overreact or buy a bunch of over priced free agents. Guys stepped up, Cruz was Discovered &amp; we
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Steve Smith, Kevin Boss, Kenny Phillips, Kareem McKenzie &amp; all were shown the door same year &amp; fans FLIPPED OUT
@NYGiantsRush And you already know were missing the playoffs? Says who?
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush I'll wait..... Matter of fact I specifically remember the last time we let players walk &amp; fans bitches we WON IT
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush In the NFL. Not other sports. When is the last time an NFL team hoisted a Lombardi Cuz they paid a bunch of FAs?
@JoelEckert1 @NYGiantsRush Lemme ask you this: When is the last time a team went on a Free agent binge &amp; won a championship as a result?
@NYGiantsRush u do realize Jennings got hurt for multiple games &amp; we were trying to learn a new offense, right? It takes time to transition
@NYGiantsRush TE is NOT a hole for one...For 2, We added OG, OT. Wether they pan out or not is TBD. WE DID fill LB holes &amp; 3rd Down RB hole
@NYGiantsRush Uh yea we did. Not starting holes. But critical depth positions &amp; Role players we certainly did.
@Patricia_Traina But Letting go of Rolle was a business decision that I completely understand. But I honestly have never been sold on Stevie
@Patricia_Traina Shoulda let Stevie Walk honestly &amp; resigned Rolle being how thin this F.A. &amp; draft class is at Safety &amp;signed Jeron Johnson
More amazing, was ALL HIS 2 HANDED DROPS!  

"@Vikings: Wallace's amazing one-handed grab

 
@NYGiantsRush I happen to think we did a nice job in free agency. Made low key, savvy, smart moves. Didnt over pay 4 anyone &amp; got good value
@NYGiantsRush supposed to be a major thing that is depended on year in &amp; year out to make a splash. That's not a successful NFL FORMULA
@NYGiantsRush Free agency is something that should compliment your team &amp; fill a hole here &amp; there that you couldn't in the draft. Not....
@NYGiantsRush ..that continuity is a good thing &amp; chemistry is an important aspect of that unit on a football team. So resigning guys = good
@NYGiantsRush So I think everybody has seen how our line was much better last season than the previous one. So any reasonable fan realizes..
@NYGiantsRush I dont think anybody's "excited" about Jerry. But I think anybody whos watched this team over the last 3 yrs KNOWS OL an issue
@NYGiantsRush NO, its a sad day when we do business same way every yr, win 2 SBs, &amp; fans still depressed when we dont go nuts in free agency
Bringing back John Jerry was probably a good thing honestly. We need all the help we can get on that OL #NYG
Mike Wallace a Viking huh?
@TrueBlue_NYC  yea he worked out for them but haven't heard of any deal being agreed on. So we should bring him in. Better than Rahim Moore
Should look at Jeron Johnson

"@TrueBlue_NYC: @MikeGarafolo  what's the story with the @Giants and the safety position? No interest at all?"
