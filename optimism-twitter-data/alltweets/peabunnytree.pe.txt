remember when we thought that falling in love was such a non-title track song
@Sl00k think*
@Sl00k how long you thinl
literally idk how i don't hate the dark &amp; wild album
@nomstax and also because the kings have won two cups in the past decade so there's that
@nomstax i just hate the one person who snuck him into practice and thought it was okay
@nomstax that's why even though i hate the kings, doesn't mean i should hate every single player like i can hate the one domestic abuser
@nomstax it's hard, but you gotta like forget about what they did off ice because right now (if you're watching the game) they're ON ice.
@nomstax sure, you can not like a player for what they did off ice but that doesn't mean that you should hate them on ice too
@nomstax that's what i learnt with hockey

@LWOSCirno friend is choosing fav member in bts, she's choosing between jimin, jungkook and rm haha and told her if jimin isnt ur no 1
@els_edwards jimin is often put at last place for best face (visuals)
@els_edwards if jimin is not your first fav, he'll be in your top 3 AT LEAST
@els_edwards i think sez said you liked jungkook
@els_edwards hehehhe if you like jimin you'll love my spams towards my friend B)
@els_edwards crazy team: V(king of insane), jungkook, jimin, jhope, sometimes: rap mon
@els_edwards swapped places
@els_edwards dancers, best to ok: Jhope, Jimin, Jungkook, V?, SUGA?, RM &amp; Jin share last place
not to sure abt jimin &amp; jungkook might be
@els_edwards vocals, best to ok: jungkook, jimin, V, jin (V &amp; jin debatable but usually this way)
@els_edwards okok: rapmon, suga, j-hope (in order of rapping qualities rm 1, jhope 3)
@els_edwards L to R: hyuk, hb(tbh he looks photoshopped x1000 in this pic), Ken, N, Ravi, Leo
@els_edwards it's OK
@els_edwards you got 1/5 right and you got ravi right
@els_edwards L TO R: V, Suga, Jin, Jimin, J-hope, RM, Jungkook
@els_edwards WAIT IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE SOMEONE FROM BTS WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE? 
@els_edwards no, it takes prac
@els_edwards naming them i gave u a list of their names
tfw u have to scroll through many photos to reach your hb reaction pics because u saved too many ooon pics

@LWOSCirno nO YOU SHOULD HAVE PHOTOSHOPPED JAMIE B*NN ONTO CHUB (REBIRTH)
YO MY FORM TEACHER IS SO NICE
@LWOSCirno but the baseline is that i don't like them very much at all, im stuck with them, can't do anything, but they're good people
@LWOSCirno sorry hheh
@LWOSCirno hahah yeah obv im still open to them and stuff and they're nice people i don't blame them but a lot of shitty things has happened

@LWOSCirno and then i look at my cg and go, u didnt show up u shits B)
@LWOSCirno they sent flowers and stuff, and obv my parent's cg really supported my mom and my sisters' cg even sent flowers
@LWOSCirno the pastors sent gifts and flowers and prayed and even the leaders(like for worship and ministry etc like below the pastors)
@LWOSCirno this singapore we're referring to. heheh. so basically my mom had to go for some kind of op and our church was really nice and
@LWOSCirno you know what a cg is right? connect group, my sisters are in one together, my mom and dad are in one together and i am in one
@LWOSCirno CIRNO IM LAUGHING SO HARD BUT CRYING BUT ALSO LAUGHING I NEED TO TELL YOU A STORY

*googling oh my girl profiles and expecting someone to be born in 2000*
did they even try with the chinese mv ?
what is up with the frame rate dropping there?
@frickin_heckie 
@frickin_heckie OH YEAH MONDAY. i forgot about monDAY LOL
@frickin_heckie when sungjoo sings they take his parts and put it again in the audio if that makes sense
@frickin_heckie yeah like after the first chorus in the kor version, sungjoo and wenhan's parts, they idk what to call it but
@frickin_heckie i did hahah
@frickin_heckie yo eoeo's chi ver really pisses me off because they reduced the audio quality or something and they didnt overlay some parts
it's not as smooth and sharp as the korean version, im very pissed
idk they might have compressed the chi audio it's weird
I GOT IT. it's that the kor version has those backup sounds things of their singing blah blah, that's why the chi version sounds so off
ITS A PARAMECIUM
and maybe there's a slight echo or something? something's wrong, i can't pinpoint it
THE BACKTRACK IS TOO SOFT. the whole chi version is just slightly off, something is wrong
UYOU KNOW WHATS WRONG WITH THE CHI VERSION?
IM SUPRISED I HAVE REMEMBERED SO MUCH OF THE TABLE
@LWOSCirno hahah enjoy 
ENGLISH*
from* i am amazing at englush HAH
