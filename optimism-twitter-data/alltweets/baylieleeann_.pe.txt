@MsBellHatesYou but knowing the context rape culture insinuates the error of continuity with this crime and how as a unified group can help
@MsBellHatesYou it's not necessarily misleading given in all cultures there is rape, the severity of the crime is seen no matter what
@MsBellHatesYou but using that key phrase everyone knows about the vulgarity and the disgustingness of the crime
@MsBellHatesYou the buzzwords are used to make these situations almost easier to reference, whether we are in a rape culture or not
@MsBellHatesYou with bringing awareness through rape culture it can help men and women victims fight this crime together
@MsBellHatesYou psych tests can be used on both to ensure what they're being told is true
@MsBellHatesYou or to "rape is a disgusting crime that shouldn't even happen"
@MsBellHatesYou dna samples, past abuse instances, or even psychological tests used on serial killers can all be used in place of polygraph
@MsBellHatesYou men have never been the sole perpetrators and unless rape is ended in all cultures men and women will continue to rape
@MsBellHatesYou ...for which at a certain level a victim cannot consent because of their incapacitation
@MsBellHatesYou it could easily be determined by lie detector tests or incapacitation levels displaying their level of intoxication...
@MsBellHatesYou women who only see men as issues do not represent the movement to pursue equal opportunities that are denied to women
@MsBellHatesYou men and women rape and also get raped in which both situations the rapist should be punished
@MsBellHatesYou coercing a woman to forced sex is not something that induces primitive 'lust' it makes you a rapist who forced an unwilling
@MsBellHatesYou if a woman refused it should be the end of it men would lie so they don't get convicted
@MsBellHatesYou because she IS a victim of a serious crime that sweeps every continent because she is seen as weaker or someone to submit
@MsBellHatesYou if a woman is incapacitated in any way or refuses sex it can used against the man in any court situation as rape
@MsBellHatesYou if men are harming women their protective instinct isn't intact; Indian men don't throw acid on girls bc they want to help

my bad.. i couldn‚Äôt hear you over all 170 pounds of me. 
@MsBellHatesYou our justice system also tends to favor men bc of the gender bias of women always "overreacting" which leads to inaccuracies
@MsBellHatesYou modern police are able to gather evidence (like semen/dna samples) thus leading to conviction of rapists but many are free
@MsBellHatesYou you do know most rapists don't even get convicted because police men and some women don't even think rape is real right?
@MsBellHatesYou and now rape is more punishable by men stating women are asking for it instead of actually punishing rapists
my sister got mad at me bc my other sisters bf is here and I'm not wearing a bra
@MsBellHatesYou rape culture is not a theory it's an actual thing women do not ask to be raped yet men still force themselves upon women
@MsBellHatesYou the women who believe in man hating don't represent the feminist movement and only tarnish any efforts of progress
@MsBellHatesYou feminism is wanting to be equal to men not hating them bc of instilled gender biases passed through generations
misandry and feminism are not the same thing at all welcome to the 21st century

always treat everyone with kindness because even if it goes against your beliefs, kindness is universal for all beliefs and religions
and if you know any transgender person always treat them lovingly because lord knows how hard it is for them to transition
if you feel like you aren't the gender assigned at birth there is nothing wrong with you and you should be able to become who you really are
