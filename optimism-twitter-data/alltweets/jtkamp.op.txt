@TIME THE NOTORIOUS RBG!!!!
@UnitedNerds you graduate? Where are you wanting to go?
@dailydot comes from other communities as well. Many which are advocators of progressive issues seem uncomfortable with this one. Very sad.
@jtkamp *empathic
I try to remember that to counter anger &amp; hate. Try to be emphatic instead of judging. Hate isn't useful. But it's hard not to feel angry.
People who start rumors, who can't understand the world isn't black &amp; white but shades of grey sadden me. Fractured, insecure &amp; broken ppl.
The lack of acceptance comes from women, many "feminists" who still expect men fit into rigid outdated expectations 
@livi_esterkamp @OliviaEsterkamp
about themselves. It's like how racists end up sleeping with a POC. The hate or fear someone has comes from a deep insecurity in themselves.
If someone reveals something about themselves and a person can't handle it, I believe it comes from things the person has not yet confronted
Miley is bi. It's okay, I totally called it a year ago. St Vincent isn't a lesbian, totally called that one too.

I've also got 3 family members with Type 2 diabetes (1 is a parent) so I guess I'm more self conscious about exercise &amp; healthy eating.
I'm a guy with a sweet tooth to rival most, yet after I eat something sugary I feel shitty &amp; depressed afterwards. I don't think it's guilt.
2) I thought the Gulf War was the Golf War and took place near the Gulf of Mexico. Basically a war were all the countries golfed eachother.

@SpotMyTots for real, like I have wayyy to many professional goals to even think of that. Plus at 23, I'm way too impatient for a kid.
I'm 23, which is the same age my dad was when I was born. That boggles my mind. Cause I ain't anywhere near ready to fux with that shit.

In fact now that I think of it, I've seen Fleetwood Mac, St Vincent, Kendrick Lamar (twice), Empire of the Sun &amp; 21 pilots ALL FOR FREE <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Didn't realize until I got free vip tickets for mon night's taping of @LateNightSeth that his band's drummer is Fred Arimsen. A must see.
And I can't believe it took me leaving Ohio for good to understand and appreciate everything about that album.
Seeing my little sister about to graduate high school &amp; start her time at OU has me playing The Suburbs non stop.
The King of Comedy might be the most underrated film ever made.
Case in point Iggy Azalea's net worth is twice that of Azealia Banks's. Now which one of these two makes the better music?
Cause whenever people call out the white female artists they say they're feminists and so they can't be wrong. Doesn't work that way
White musicians have ripped off black ones since before even jazz. Lame to think though it's happening in the exact same way as 20 years ago
Now it seems White female artists are the ones shamelessly ripping off. Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, and Iggy Azalea &lt;---- Vanilla Ice
Remember in the 90's how white male hip hop artists were constantly ripping &amp; profiting  off black ones? Aka: Vanilla Ice
Cause when it comes to race, white people fee the compulsion to MAKE IT ABOUT THEM, men &amp; women.
Meanwhile everyone gets hard over sentimental crap like The Help.
It takes a lot for a movie to put me in tears, but the end of Do The Right Thing does. Why? Cause it speaks to something true &amp; real
It's like "hey we can't make a movie about race unless there's a feisty white girl who will save the day"
Isn't it great how films like Selma &amp; Do The Right Thing get snubbed while Blind Side and The Help get a big ole circle jerk
@SpotMyTots Cut him in the eyes!!
@SpotMyTots The moment I saw this I thought of sophomore year of college and now I feel really stoned for no reason #IfreakinhateTrudy.
To all the benevolent white people who have all the "answers" or judge the protesters: STFU MOTHERFUCKER THIS AINT THE BLIND SIDE!!!
This video clip puts into words my views on Baltimore and so many other things 
Dudes who shave the sides of their heads' but still try to have a manbun are ruining the manbun. Not a cool look, just bein a wannabe.
Every T I've ever met has always been very cross
bc of some bs she reads in Cosmo about how she doesn't fit this mold or something. And I'm like "what are you talking about?you're great"
It's makes me sad when I meet a girl who is sexy, mysterious, complex and just a fantastic person who thinks less of herself
But I read diets for women and it's like "you can only eat a carrot and a piece of chicken if you want to be in shape" which seems hard af
I feel bad for women when it comes to dieting and being in shape. For guys "dieting" is eating steak, eggs, pb &amp; getting 4,500 cals a day
In NYC women can be just as sexually aggressive as men. I ain't complainin though <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>.

It's always funny in NYC when you run into the same person twice in one day. Especially when that person is Peter Dinklage.

Don awakens on his office sofa in 1960 with Roger Sterling standing over him saying "Ready to prove Lucky Strikes don't kill?" END CREDITS
Finally with no option left, the doctors are forced to perform electroshock therapy. Upon the first shock there's a ZAP!! Then....
.....Don can only respond with "I'M DICK WITMAN" while drooling and soiling himself uncontrollably. He still smokes cigarettes tho
Ok so that's the penultimate episode. The series finale is 45 mins of people visiting Don in an insane asylum.....
When he awakens he has no recollection of who Don Draper is and earnestly yells "I'M DICK WITMAN" While slobbering uncontrollably.
In the 5th inning a hard line drive foul ball hits Don in the head knocking him unconscious.
Don will get free Mets tickets (courtesy of McCann). He takes Bobby &amp; Gene to the game
Based on this information I can safely say how Mad Men will end
In the fall of 1969 what team won the world series? The New York Mets. Boom
We can deduce based on the Nixon Cambodia speech in ep 1/8 that the show is now at early summer of 1970
Paying attention to last night's Mad Men? The Mets flag that belonged to Lane was featured prominently in the episode's shot structure

Masculinity, being a real man, means being true to yourself, loving and accepting yourself and living a life based from integrity
But masculinity isn't some bro code, it isn't tying a tie a certain way, or paying the bill or doing this rule or that rule
Reclaiming one's masculinity is important. It makes men feel more at center, making them less resentful and more genuine
I love myself for who I am. My flaws are not weaknesses but signs of my humanity
I do not need the approval or acceptance of women for validation of my own self worth
When I look at myself too many of these traits come forward. Which isn't something I am necessarily happy about
In the end Nice Guys are wimps who frame themselves as victims and act from an ungenuine place. They feel they must hide who they are
Often these men lack a true emotional center and will let some external part of their life define their emotional center
They will often frame themselves as the victim of a situation because they feel helpless and in some ways lost
The problem is these men let women define their masculinity and in the end hold a deep toxic shame towards their own masculinity
These men often resort to passive aggressive, indirect behavior, in the hopes they can manipulate a situation to their will
Many times these men hold a hidden hatred toward women, in the form of a subversive, passive aggressive misogyny
These men often hide a deep rage because they do not feel they can properly express their emotions in a healthy manner
Inversely many of these men resort to PUA or MRA sites thinking this will gain the approval of women. Again, still a place of dishonesty
These men will manipulate their image and behavior to what they think women will like or approve of, thus acting from a place of dishonesty
On the surface these guys will often appear caring, nurturing and well adjusted. Often these men feel they must hide all their flaws.
Nice Guy: A man who needs the approval of others (especially women) to feel fulfilled in their needs

And you only have yourself to blame, for all of it. And you realize the only real problem you have, is that you're you.
<BILLIARDS><HAMMER><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
And all you want is to not be acting like a stupid wacko anymore, to just feel fucking normal again.
And you look at yourself and see how crazy and irrational your acting because of one stupid moment
Yet no matter what the stupid fucking moment seems to keep coming back to remind you what a failure you really are
Until one day you realize your only life pursuit has to become to so preoccupied you hope one day the thought of it all goes away
But it's like a monkey on your back with a tiny little hammer that keeps hitting you in balls and won't seem to go away
You do everything you can to forget and move past the moment, because that's all you want, is to just forget about it
Before you know it the moment keeps bugging you and bogging you down. Distracting you from everything else in life
And in that moment you suddenly realize everything that's wrong with you as a person
Do you ever have a moment in life were all you need to do is something so simple &amp; easy but for some reason you don't do it

I can tell this show was designed for clinically depressed people to enjoy.

Dudes Flirting With The Barista: A Brooklyn Story
This cafe is playing Nick Drake and The Smiths &amp; it's giving me a total flashback to sophomore year of college.
I love when a song sounds like it was meant to be in the soundtrack of a movie 
In my head: "God I love the oscars!!! I love movies, I love Hollywood. Tonight I will dream of the moment I accept the golden statue"
Not gonna watch the Oscars, gonna go to sleep instead cause I have to be up early. Besides it's just a big Hollywood circle jerk f off oscar
Quit smoking &amp; hating every living thing on the earth right now.
It's Oscar Weekend!! Curl up by the fire (In my case, a barrel near the east river) and watch the movies you love!
I am going to remember this winter for many years to come, as one of the strangest &amp; weirdest moments of my life.

I really hope the final episodes of Mad Men take place in the 70's because the 70's were a goddamn awesome decade. Favorite Era by far.
It's all just so plain goddamn stupid.
Never live life with shoulda, woulda and couldas. The world is not movie, some plotlines and stories will never resolve themselves
Regret is an infestation of maggots which will eat you from within, everyday slowly gnawing away at your psyche leaving you empty
Never be afraid of acting when the moment calls. Especially when you know you should, even in the moment.
First Love, however stupid, dumb &amp; naive it may be, is an indelible ink, which fucks with a person far longer than any 1 thing should.
Don't worry about what the others are doing, you must embrace what is special about you

If Selma had its limited release at Thanksgiving instead of Christmas it wouldn't of gotten snubbed. This is why I only care about Cannes.
I hope Birdman sweeps at the Oscars, maybe for once, the film that's actually the best of the year will win Best Picture.

But it feels too often people say "catcalling happens: men are pigs" maybe we should ask why men feel the need to catcall.

What the fuck do I know though? I'm just a white dude.
Guys are held to certain expectations too ladies. If you want to change the way you are treated you need to consider that.
I mean that video really bothered me, and I can imagine being catcalled feels very dehumanizing. But what's the line?

@RealMEsterkamp The Grammys were shit the moment Jethro Tull won metal album of the year. There's always politics involved in these awards
@RealMEsterkamp Instead it's always the bloated historical epics, like when Dances with Wolves beat Goodfellas for the best pic in 1990
@RealMEsterkamp This always happens with best picture, the gritty film with the relevant social commentary never wins,
@RealMEsterkamp No kidding, 12 Years A Slave has to be one of the weakest best pictures winners I've seen in years.
Why are kids so damn annoying?
It's time to purge
They're just waiting for the right moment to strike <CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE> 
Let it go, walk away, free the burden of the thought. It was a moment, it was a second, but that moment has passed and is gone.
In fact DBC should of won best pic. 12YAS was good, but a very safe, as per usual, choice by the academy. #weakbestpicture
American Hustle, Her, Dallas Buyers Club, 12 Years a Slave and The Act of Killing. I watched them all today. DBC was my favorite.
Of course Brad Pitt casts himself as the GGG who hates slavery #typical #12YearsASlave
Benedict Cumberbatch's southern accent sounds like a mix of Dennis Quad and Harrison Ford #12YearsASlave
Is every random white celebrity in #12YearsASlave
Man that would suck to blackout and wake up in chains #12YearsASlave
MM is brilliant in DBC. He's the one who carries this movie.
Her is a sad look into how the world will be in 5 years. Everybody's gonna be depressed and introverted.
Congrats to all the winners of tonights #oscars Now I'm going t bed. I'm gonna have a nice movie marathon tomorrow.

I'm humored by everyone's surprised reactions to the Oscars. I'm just like "Duh the Oscars are Bullshit!" 1990 anybody?
Haha all the composers sit together, are they some weird posse? #Oscars
Holdie Gone
Roger Ebert's passing still is the one that gets me the most <CRYING FACE>

God damn, I'm loving this shot composition #Oscars2014
If Gravity wins this, I will be really pissed
@lindshatchtag I know right!? Cuar√≥n is definitely a director with great visual imagination
In all fairness Alfonso Cuar√≥n DID direct the best Harry Potter
Another one for Gravity, of course I'm not surprised.
Shout out to the D.P.'S!!!

Laughter is the greatest weapon. If you can make others laugh, you bring joy into their life, and in doing so, your own life as well.

Being reminded of things from nearly a decade ago.
Music that makes you feel like your touching the face of god.
Ohio by Patty Griffin
Being told I'm afraid and realizing it's totally true.
Asking for the truth. Getting a deflection as an answer.
"I only smoke when I'm drunk and stressed"
Bumming a Lucky Strike
A pair of feline eyes
If a woman reads you like a book I find it's best to show her all the pages.
Quoting Frank Underwood
Being sung Hey Jude by a choir of angels
Being honest when I should've lied.
Sharing a mutual distaste for the same place.
Telling a friend they're a weasel, even though I am too.
Seeing a black cat run from the dance floor the moment they saw me
"I feel like we share this unspoken connection"
Losing my memory every 15 minutes
Getting in a fight/wrestling match
Smiling like there was nothing different in my appearance.
Until I killed it
Being the life of the party
Crying on a sidewalk quoting Bon Iver
You get an A+ in my book
Valentines day 2005
"Because I have trouble emotionally expressing myself ok!"
Forgetting it all for almost a month
Blacking out at the 11th stroke of midnight
Being offered the chance of a lifetime and foolishly rejecting it
Pointing a gun to a pair of terrified eyes and then to my own head.
Names aren't important.
You're just a good guy who's going through a rough time
Breaking a glass in the middle of the street.
Swing dancing to the Angry Birds theme song.

@OU_Confessions I've been there before. Just keep pushing, things can and do get better.
