You're kidding me right? That school has got some issues. 
It looks that way.

@ChaseS19 Yeah. Honestly, Governor Hutchinson and Gov. Pence of Indiana are total embarrassments.
@ChaseS19 I live in Arkansas and I'm disgusted by this bill.
Arkansas is closer to making #HB1228 into law. If Gov. Hutchinson signs that bill, Arkansas would become the 2nd state to have such a law.
@AaronBone1 so fucking true! Love this tweet! #BoycottIndiana
To the LGBT community in Indiana: I'm sorry that you have a bigoted governor. Karma will come back to bite him in the ass. #BoycottIndiana
@cleanbeef @GovPenceIN Well, I'm originally from Texas. I just loathe any hateful bills lawmakers propose or sign.
What is wrong with that school? 
I'm one pissed off guy right now. 
If the governor signs the measure into law, it’ll make Arkansas the second state to enact such a change this... 
I'll never, ever visit Indiana at all. @GovPenceIN is such an embarrassment. Implementing hateful bills has consequences. #BoycottIndiana
@GovPenceIN claims that #SB101 is not about discrimination. I call bullshit on that. That state's not getting my business. #BoycottIndiana

I'm surprised that people created a Facebook page for this prick. 
#SB101: The hateful bill that was signed into law in Indiana yesterday by Governor Pence. Last I checked, this was 2015, not the 1800's.
I don't feel sorry for Governor Pence at all. Discrimination against all people is wrong and unjust. Bigotry is... 
Indiana is so messed up because of that religious freedom bill that was signed yesterday, which…
