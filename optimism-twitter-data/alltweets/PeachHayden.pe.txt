Wi-fi isn't working &amp; can't do my assignments for class. Awesome. <PENSIVE FACE>
Nice to know I'm not appreciated by some people after all the shit I've done for them &amp; all the times I've been there for them. Fuck you.
@Sir_IanDavis @MetalcoreColts I disagree. I think Falling In Reverse should've headlined &amp; let Ronnie kick everyone out.
@MetalcoreColts And they think the softer stuff they have on Common Courtesy makes them sellouts. It's stupid.
@MetalcoreColts Exactly. What people don't seem to understand about ADTR is that they keep their softer side to attract a bigger fan base.
It makes me laugh that people think ADTR are sellouts when in reality, bands like OM&amp;M, MIW, &amp; MIW are the real sellouts.
Ready to go home &amp; lay in fucking bed already. Feeling like complete shit... <TIRED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
@ljgrisham @TGCBand Well we're never sure when we'll go on.

@ljgrisham Should've came to see @TGCBand tonight ya dumbass!
That set was absolutely insane &amp; the most memorable one yet! Thanks to all who came to see @TGCBand tonight!
Sick of these people bailing on me. If you don't wanna hang out or come to something I invited you to, just tell me. God damn...
So... This is tonight at The Hatch. Hope to see you all there! @TGCBand 

Today is the 20-yr anniversary!

@Sheeyybbee I LOVE Jesse though!
@Sheeyybbee But he's also the biggest piece of shit in the show. Lol. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Sheeyybbee I was the same exact way. I have SO much acting inspiration from that show. Mainly from Aaron Paul!
@Sheeyybbee That's what I'm saying girl! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> lol
