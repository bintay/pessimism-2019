The spaghetti squash I made tonight was way toooo good. Yum i could eat it all the time.

@TorrieMowry Yeah seriously... So dumb haha. So if you're 20, married (or not) with a child...you're a "hoe w/ a baby" right.....
The amount of vulgarity I see being used amongst this generation is really mind blowing and sad.
One of the most pathetic and ignorant things I've ever read

Two and a half weeks and I'll be across the country and also in a different country. Crazy <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Kingston got his first $5 dollar bill and I took him to the mall to spend it. So cute. I love seeing him happy :)
I LOVE eating clean and fueling my body with the proper foods...... But I seriously have a problem with craving pizza.... Every day <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@RyanSchmitz_4 you're telling me that Donald Trump is really at your school???
Being told that I influenced, encouraged or impacted someone's thoughts or life. No better feeling than that!
@sydniejade_ When you go with dates you don't like they always end up sucking hahaha
@HaleyHunter_ aweeeee we were babies <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
So glad Candra got to experience prom right before she got diagnosed. Such a fun night and memory <TWO HEARTS>

Have zero time for negative and unsupportive people in my life. I'm happy and God is doing amazing things to myself &amp; the ppl around me <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
All of my neighbors are so annoying. They either let their dogs bark for hours or blare their music at 2am. Really disrespectful <FISTED HAND SIGN>üèº
I'm a smart girl, I make good choices. I know what's best for me and my life and if you don't agree than get off my social media accounts.
Through a lot and the fact that people bash him for his life decisions. Leave the poor man alone for goodness sakes. Not easy what hes doing
Not a fan of the Kardashian's, but it makes me mad when people talk all this crap about Bruce. That family is dysfunctional &amp; he has been
@aalleexxiisss1 oh yeah I know that brand! Ah thank you :)

@rosalyngarcia yeah I've heard about doing that before!! I got diagnosed with certain health issues and those are the things I have to stay
@rosalyngarcia I'm actually not sure haha it's been too long since I was told
No gluten, dairy, caffeine and now no sugar. This is going to be hard, but I can do it and I am so determined to get better and help myself.
@allywimer sorry just saw this!! It's called Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay. It's amazing seriously recommend it!
So easy to take your parents for granted. But once you realize how much they love you &amp; what they do for you it changes everything.
I'm so blessed to have the mom that I do. I've been through a lot and still facing a lot and she is always here helping me in every way <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>üèº<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@rustimariee yes pleaseeee :)
@TorrieMowry exactly what I was thinking of haha <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><HIBISCUS>
Being a good friend is more than just hanging out. It's about being supportive, encouraging, uplifting and mentally&amp;emotionally being there.
I've swept all of the no good people out of my life &amp; only keep a small circle of amazing people around. Such a good feeling.

I'm honestly so grateful that I come from a family that's extremely health conscious &amp; into naturopathic medicine. No way I'd rather have it
This really is going to be the best summer possibly ever... So so excited for all the adventures and fun times to come.

@ItsLoMase and I love veggies and fruits. Normally all my diet consists of is meat, fruits and veggies but lately I've been slacking
@ItsLoMase ah yes I need to do that! I'm gluten free generally because gluten makes me mentally and physically sick, so I can do that easily
@ItsLoMase I've always wanted to try a cleanse! What type do you recommend?
I have 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds. Let's do this <FLEXED BICEPS>üèº<WORRIED FACE>

Why are man buns SO attractive???!!
I find it hilarious how defensive people get when their true colors get brought to light haha.
Am I the only one who loves Justin Bieber's new song w/ Skrillex &amp; Diplo? <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Really needing to watch bridesmaids
@_h0llyyy I was just thinking that when I looked at her post
Some people....I pray for them.
@Julia_Chaney alright dude. Well you have your outlook and I have mine. Have a nice day
@Julia_Chaney bashing is more along the lines of calling her a slut or an easy girl. I said I think it's sad &amp; I think many ppl would agree
@Julia_Chaney I personally find it sad that girls are PROUD of being used and feel the need to boast about it to the world.
@Julia_Chaney Julia you can think whatever you want lol I never said there was anything wrong with her having sex w/ him. I was stating that
@Julia_Chaney but to sit there and blast that all over social media and being proud of being used in my opinion is SAD.
@Julia_Chaney well people have different morals and I just think it's sad that girls sink that low and have no respect for themselves.
@Julia_Chaney it's sad that she has no self respect nor does she value herself in any way and feels the need to post that.
‚Äú@collegefession: "Used for sex by one of the hottest guys on campus and I'm not even mad, totally worth it." - Ohio State-ATI‚Äùwow thats sad

Lol when your kid wakes up randomly at 1 in the morning and starts punching you and being mean hahah ok cranky 
If there's one thing I've learned these last couple months it's that life is seriously short people. Live it to the fullest every single day
I'm such a night owl... And I totally love it until morning comes around.
You know you're fat when you drive all the way to Trader Joes at 9 at night just to get gluten free cupcakes.....
@lauuubibbins I can only imagine.... I'm not prepared for this at all. It's crazy
When someone you love so much is dying in front of your eyes... Your brain literally doesn't want to accept it. It's crazy
Its suppose to be the most wonderful time of the year, but you're leaving me&amp; not going to be able to celebrate it with me so idk what to do
Sometimes I feel literally crazy in the head and I can't keep up with my thoughts and emotions
Lol I could care les about having friends. Everyone's so immature these days. All I need is the fam
I'm hungry. I want mexican food.
Girl Scout cookie coffee creamers were the best decision I've made in a while

Little things like that are so special.. Idk how people bash on them so much. They're going around this broken town speaking positivity to
I was sitting outside of Chipotle with Kingston &amp; these Bethel guys come out and one of them is like "is he yours? You're such a good mom"
When people stand next to you in line who smell like cigs so bad.... #goaway
It trips me out seeing girls in this town that are like 19,20.. Going on their second or third kid. That's crazy <FEARFUL FACE>
@KatieWion that is always so tough. I know that feeling... But you're gorgeous and smart and the RIGHT guy will come along and cherish you:)
@KatieWion I really am <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> he's so incredible. I got so blessed. Yours will come around too and it'll probably be totally unexpected :)
When you're with someone amazing, you should be so damn proud of them and love showing them off.

I so commonly see people trying to compete with where there at in life with other people. The way I see it is everyone has their own journey

And then they end up with eating disorders and have no chance at things and get made fun of. Pisses me off
It makes me so angry to see obese children. You do not need to be feeding them Mcdonalds and all that bullshit when their two
Just ordered a "secret menu" drink from Starbucks and it tastes like poo:(

@HaleyHunter_ Of course girly. You and your little man deserve the world so never settle for less <SPARKLING HEART> Thanks so much!!
@HaleyHunter_ Don't ever feel unwanted because you're beautiful, special and a great mom. God has the right guy for you just be patient <TWO HEARTS>

If there's one thing I wish I got to do in my life it's going off to college. Can't imagine how awesome of an experience that would've been

‚Äú@RyanSchmitz_4: @___Maeve still ain't got nothing on you boo‚Äù mad love for you baby <TWO HEARTS>
1 thing Im happy about now was not having all these social media sites growing up. I actually explored and adventured&amp;appreciated my youth.
I see all these girls and think they're like 20.. And than they talk about going into their junior year in HS and I'm like whatttttttt <FLUSHED FACE>
I love seeing genuinely happy couples. Makes me smile
‚Äú@WhennBoys: FUTURE GOALS 
@kayleeputnam lol I can see her doing that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
This couple next to me at in n out is fighting and now they're fighting over salt and then snap chat and now fighting over their fries <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Not even in a stupid way, but some people really are haters. They hate watching you succeed &amp; do good things. It's sad. Be happy for others!
Ryan is literally so good with him--it melts my heart <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
My old boss has fired 10 people and 12 people have quit just in the last year.... 22 people from a small business... Lmao PSYCHO

@riguyy @RyanSchmitz_4 thanks Riley that's what I was telling him!
McDonald's is so disgusting. I truly don't get how people eat it
Messy buns and simple makeup &gt;&gt;&gt; 
@Julia_Chaney I've seen these types of tea's everywhere haha I wanna one eventually
Do you think you can buy a flat stomach off Ebay?
@tpcuzimdashyt Mom life lol. Barely have time to apply makeup or do your hair. But you're naturally beautiful and don't need it <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@MeggFaith I'm the same exact way lol. Text me I wanna talk to you about somethinnn
Haven't worn makeup for 3 days in a row and it feels so good
@BD4rd I will :)
So excited to start making these dream catchers :') 
Only a high of 84 today. Thank you Jesus!
uhrgggg
Ryan thinks it's funny to harass me when I'm on the toilet 
My whole family is SO supportive of my career choice and tells me how successful I'll be at it. Nothing feels better than hearing that
Robin Williams committed suicide. How sad I loved him :(
YOU'RE WEIRD.
Hahahahaha
When you get so excited about yogurt covered raisins you spill them everywhere&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 
@tpcuzimdashyt that's what happens when you have a perfect child <SMIRKING FACE>
Feels amazing being in love with the best guy that's so good to me and Kingston. Pays off being patient <TWO HEARTS>
Ryan just helped me clean my whole house. I really do have the best boyfriend, just throwing it out there <SMIRKING FACE>

Night time makes me think deep thoughts
So over the heat
Too many girls cling and rely on their other half for everything. Be your own person
Being in a relationship is awesome and wonderful, but you have to balance it out and still be independent and have a life of your own
Addicted to rice cakes w/ peanut butter
Justin Bieber is such a dumb punk now. Can't stand the douche anymore

Still my jam 
Things get boring to me so quick.
I can't wait to move out of Redding to a place that actually has some culture and style.........
Just came across this and i'm in love. Want to visit here some day 
‚Äú@coffee_n_mtns: #cabinvibes

Having a conversation with this adorable girl who's 29 and a virgin and I'm teaching her how guys work haha. So cute
It really confuses me seeing girls wear sweats and uggs in 100 degree weather...
When you send your mom a serious, long text and she reads it and never replies.... <GRIMACING FACE>
I'm the sweetest girlfriend <SMIRKING FACE> 
@courtcanaga yeah I totally remember that too!! Haha the good ole days listening to mtv songs in the mornings
