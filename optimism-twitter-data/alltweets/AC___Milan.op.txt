@MilanEye #madeoutofglass
@uk_acmilan Fucking morons at the helm of Milan
@uk_acmilan Free and cheap transfer of summer coming right up
@milanmania fans know that we should have used him as a bait to sign Gabigol. Morons ruining the club. Brainless move by ignorant management
#milanello #el92 @acmilan 


@milanmania it is unlikely with bidones at the club. Need reinforcement and ASAP
@milanmania reality may hurt but we can only hope and dream
@milanmania no one can take that away :). I want Milan to be a top club again and we all have waited too long for this to happen
@milanmania selling the club, I know he won't spend that's set in stone.
@milanmania no one knows what will happen in 2 months. I'd like to be realistic and want to dream for 2 months.
@milanmania may be true but not losing hope mate
@milanmania If I lose hope then all is gone. I can't do that and staying optimistic
@milanmania We will wait and see. Like I said it hurts to see the team in this state
@milanmania not giving up Bee yet. He left to gather the banks and come back.
@milanmania let be a little positive. I will stay optimistic. All BS talk right now by Berlu
@emmy4real01 @milanmania He needs to play behind the strikers.
@milanmania like I said if the rumors are true with the 70-100 million spending then I'm satisfied. Can't believe them yet though
@milanmania I'm hoping the rumors are true. I know all about the debts... Trying to be hopeful and optimistic i guess
@milanmania hope we can have a summer to get some decent players. Been too long and our hearts can't take this shit anymore
@milanmania horrible, weak mid. Monto should leave, Poli and VG are backups.
@milanmania should be an interesting summer the least to say
@milanmania he never got any minutes at Chelsea. Whatever the case is he is a decent backup
@milanmania he is on loan from Chelsea not sure if he is in Jose's plans, highly doubt it! Emery would be a nice selection
@milanmania meaning Van Ginkel is Chelsea's youth. We need a proper coach before entertaining our youth for sure
@milanmania Toxic environment that is for sure. I just want some of them to gain top flight experience instead of other team's prospects
@milanmania why can't we give our youth a chance?
Who would you rather have?
Fav- Dybala
@Planetmilan NOOO THX
@MilanEye why can't we bring Niang back? #CluelessManagement
@milanmania SMH .... Not surprised from Milan management
@AzzurroMilan No Lopez = Milan in relegation. Relax mate. Honda and Menez I don't care about.
@milanmania Trolling fans all day ....
@MilanEye 1!!!!!
@ZaccardoC @TheMilanGuys Time for you to leave already!!! Waste of space and money

He'd piss himself just seeing you running towards him. <FLEXED BICEPS> 
there's not a thing that I would change
cause you're amazing
just the way you are 
@ACMilanSydney fake injury
@TeamMessi 

@milanmania unfortunately it is correct. He is a legend and shouldn't have been dealt this way by management. Seedorf 2.0
@milanmania at least be honest about the situation, everyone knows he is unhappy even Gattuso said it.
@milanmania #ballless
@MilanEye appreciate all you do for us fellas!! #ForzaMilan
@milanmania As a player he was God. Coach and someone to tell the truth = NO
@milanmania another BS
@milanmania BS

Important game today at 8:45 vs Rome. 
@KingTufficult @theroyalhalf we can finally watch some meaningful hockey in Vegas. This should be LA's 2nd home
@MilanEye Apparently no one wants to leave Milan!



Milan are going big! 

First Pato, then Ibra, now Silva?

They all want back!

@uk_acmilan Di Milfetta, Niang, Modic
@RossoneriBlog To let their morale down? Why play them at this point if the team is going to lose. Not a nice way to introduce youth!
@ACMilanSydney We would be in relegation without him. Deserves the captain armband. #ForzaMilan

Next season.. We will make it harder for you ;-) 
@MilanEye Damn Right it is!!!

@MilanEye who are his men? Is Maldini involved?
@MilanEye Selfish and not thinking for the good of Milan.
@Planetmilan he has lost the locker room
@ACMilanNorway @iMilanRossoneri Unfucking believable. Embarrassing the least to say.
@ACMilanSydney Agreed! Now I read reports idiot Berlu doesn't want to sell. Only Berlu &amp; Milan will do something like this. Embarrassing!
@ACMilanNYC Horrible fucking management. #YouthProject
@MilanEye Went to get milk on his chopper.


@ACMilanNorway @iMilanRossoneri GOOD RIDDANCE!!!
@MilanEye Something is brewing.....
@ACMilanSydney Milan's season is over anyway. 5 games left with no Europe to qualify for. Can't wait until the season is over.
@MilanEye This is best for now. Let Brocchi take care of Primavera as they are doing well. The focus should be next year.
@footballitalia I think this is best for now. Brocchi doing well with Primavera. Only 5 games left to end the season.
-GC 
@ACMilanNorway @AdamoRitacco noooooooo
@TheMilanGuys 100000% agree!!
@MilanHouse @iMilanRossoneri plays on a shitty team


Tonig…
@TheMilanGuys NO THANKS
@MilanEye and Suso?
@uk_acmilan I had the Udinese game recorded but deleted it after reading the post game comments. No heart left!
@uk_acmilan &amp; Antonelli as both aren't included. Inzaghi a shit coach recalling Muntari after his fucked up behavior. Something isn't right
@517design @abedross well said!!
@NDJ_Official <LARGE RED CIRCLE><MEDIUM BLACK CIRCLE>️
@MilanEye No one at this point is going to tell the truth or share what has happened on the bus.

@Hootinbauer @LAKings you are trolling the Kings fans that's what. That was an unnecessary comment with ignorance.
@Hootinbauer @LAKings I was there going nuts. #witness
@Hootinbauer @LAKings Don't even go there with your team down to the Flames 1-3. Embarrassing. Waste of playoff spot!!!
3 - Italian
3 - Spanish
1 - German
1 - Ukrainian

And they say Italy is dead.
@NotDeadRyanDunn @theroyalhalf Waste of playoff spot!!!
@alecko11 it was live on 
@ACMilanSydney we can meet up if you'd like. It would be a pleasure for me to meet a Milanista in LA
@ACMilanSydney @DavidAmoyal That should be a nice long trip for you. You will definitely enjoy it. When in LA, let me know 1/2

@SalihAltan2 Shit face, go back and check your timeline and see who started badmouthing. It is very obvious who lost the argument. Too funny
@SalihAltan2 you should hide and not speak you embarrassment to society
@SalihAltan2 my family is proud of me unlike yours you ass hole, telling you lies for 100 years. Fucking disgusting piece of shit you are!
@SalihAltan2 I can't even call you a human you cunt! Go check the facts and history before you embarrass yourself you moron
@SalihAltan2 Go fuck yourself you fucking piece of shit. This proves how fucked up you are and how your family told lies to you you fuck
@SalihAltan2 @AgoGwen @MaxBlumenthal Denying facts deserves full honor? Don't talk about honor before you apologize

@DavidAmoyal Rondo is not coming. Not a max player, Love I wouldn't mind at all with another max player, high draft pick and our youngsters
@SalihAltan2 @AgoGwen @MaxBlumenthal You ignorant, look at history and facts!!!
@RossellaMarrai @iMilanRossoneri it's a shame if we do lose him
@AcmNicky @RossoneriBlog Makdini and Nesta part of Bee's plans. If true, this is great
@AcmNicky @RossoneriBlog We will see. Let's hope someone buys Milan. I want a good owner who cares about the team!
@AcmNicky @RossoneriBlog Chinese with consortium? Nah don't think so
@LisaTashjian Disgusting to watch how the @NHLJets are playing. They had the game for the 2nd game in a row and gave it away. Loserpeg!!!

И ты не знаешь, как себя развлечь?

@ACMilanSydney Bright future for Milan assuming they won't sell our young product.

@thenLeslieSaid welcome back
@ArmeniaSoccer you have a link for the game??
Ancelotti -&gt; Italia
#weareacmilan 

@uk_acmilan Only time will show
@uk_acmilan Muntari and Essien should not sniff the pitch or get close to it
@uk_acmilan Neither has Suso!
@uk_acmilan I'm not hating on any of Milan players! Wow you are completely taking this out of context
@uk_acmilan MVG is not worthy of keeping at Milan.
@uk_acmilan you have completely misunderstood my point mate
@uk_acmilan develop and grow our own players. 3/3
@uk_acmilan Some of the moves I liked but most are band-aids to our real problems. I don't like loan moves in general instead we can 2/3
@uk_acmilan Antonelli, Bochetti were moves that needed in defense because of injuries. All Milan's transactions are loans nowadays. 1/2
@uk_acmilan again we should work on our own players not rentals. Waste of time!!!
@uk_acmilan I highly doubt it
@uk_acmilan please read my previous tweets. I said Primavera players, I didn't want to individualize anyone. Cutrone, DiMolfetta included
@uk_acmilan if he was someone like Kevin De Bruyne we would know by now. He is not 20!
@uk_acmilan to waste time on. It is time to concentrate on our own players. 2/2
@uk_acmilan I like him if he produces asking price too much for Milan. He will be going back to Roma. Van Ginkel is not someone Milan 1/2
@uk_acmilan No way! That would be a stupid move. We have Mastalli who can be given a chance, Suso... Not other team's projects
@uk_acmilan again why should we keep him instead of having one of our own players develop. Remember he didn't want to come to Milan
@uk_acmilan no he is not, we should be developing our own players!!
@MilanWitness stupid decision!!!
@uk_acmilan What for? We should develop our own young players not Chelsea's. Another idiotic decision by management
@ACMilanSydney so instead of developing our Primavera players, we are taking another year of Marco van Ginkel? This is idiotic
@ACMilanNorway @iMilanRossoneri then again, priorities are not well handled at @acmilan
@MilanEye what about the captain @Mastalli8 ???
@DavidAmoyal Epic FAIL
@RossoneriBlog Milan's future? NOT..... Unreal how Suso or Mastalli couldn't play the last 3-4 minutes. Really disappointing from Pippo
@MilanEye Curva Sud learning from Roma fans after their boycott in their loss to Fiorentina
@MilanEye He only whispers into Pippo's ears. Never seen him yell out instructions to players. Time for him to leave.
Who turns 39 today. @sandronesta13 
@acmilan disgusting to watch the  game. Horrible performance. No tactics, no game plan
@RossoneriBlog Inzaghi tactics. DISGUSTED with the performance. The most boring football
@milanmania @Milan_Champions  This was classic
@milanmania @Milan_Champions As a coach he is clueless, great player/legend.
@milanmania @Milan_Champions  HAHAHAHA  I'm pretty much immune to Milan's losses. Can't express myself anymore because of my anger.
@milanmania @Milan_Champions He must be blind, deaf, or delusional. How is it that we can see the issues with Milan but he can't.
@milanmania @Milan_Champions and I thought I was dreaming when he said this comments about the Pazzo sub with Bocchetti
@milanmania @Milan_Champions Each game I have hope but disgusted and disappointed at the end
@milanmania @Milan_Champions Give Suso a chance, what do we have to lose 3rd place? UCL is not reachable, maybe he is a good surprise
@milanmania Essien, Van Ginkel, Muntari is the competition or Monto? Can't imagine Suso is worse than any of the mentioned. Delusional Pippo
@MilanEye Idiotic thinking by Galliani
@AnzeKopitar Congrats Anze!! GKG!!!
@insomniapath what a classless move. How was your beatdown by the Hawks today 2-6? You mad?
@lakingsinsider awesome!!!
@ACMilanSydney Happy Birthday!! May you see better days of Milan along with us
@LisaTashjian need 5 of 6 against Nucks!!
@MilanEye about time someone is thinking of Maldini. Will believe it when I see it

@Milanello this was the most useless pick up in the summer
@ACMilanSydney What a sad reality for all Milan fans. All the provincial teams are confident to get results playing Milan. WOW!

@ACMilanBros this team needs an experienced coach. No other option should be considered.
@Milanello COMICAL!!!
@ACMilanNorway @TheMilanGuys completely clueless!

FAVORITE if you think he deserves more time
@ACMSoCal The result just ruined my sunny California weekend
@TheMilanGuys who really gives a flying fuck!!!
@ACMilanNYC I'm starting to become immune to Milan losing. It hurts so much but I can't show any emotions. Disgraceful, ashamed as a fan
That won't change the argument..

Cuz the way @ACMilan play..
Is the same "random" <PILE OF POO>!!
@ACMilanSydney Wishful thinking. Won't happen!!
@ACMilanNYC @UmbertoGandini    This is a disgraceful performance. I'm embarrassed to watch games and gutted at results. DO SOMETHING ALREADY
@ACMilanSydney Disgrace, embarrassment, joke of a mid table team Milan is
@milanmania what a CLUELESS coach we have
@ACMilanSydney I don't think players want to play for him anymore
@ACMilanNYC I don't know how this guy is an automatic starter
@OfficialSuzyB welcome my Armenian friend!
#MilanVerona #SerieA @Mastalli8
@Milanello Milan better extend Di Molfetta's contract
@RossoneriBlog the guy never passes, egocentric maniac he is.
@lakingsinsider that would be awesome. Finally showed up in the shoot outs! #GKG
@lakingsinsider that's what I meant. By the way thanks for your interviews and reports before and after the games!!
@lakingsinsider this was reported a week ago. The strong 2 days hasn't happened yet?
GKG!!!
@OfficialSuzyB you have nice pics Suzy jan
@MilanClubPhilly  looks nice mate
@uk_acmilan The squad should have been reduced this year too. Way too many players
@milanmania I'm in the same situation you are mate
@ACMilanNorway @TheCalcioGuy Unfortunately I have to agree with you @ACMilanNorway
@MilanEye more unnecessarily playing time for Muntari and Essien. Disgusting!
@milanmania I'm really tired of venting each week. At the end of her day nothing changes. It really hurts watching them play week in and out
@TheCalcioGuy Surprised? Wow. They put this shit team together. Inzaghi is clueless without ideas, tactics. It hurts watching them play
@milanmania worse than our current shit midfield. Inconsistent, slow, and out of ideas.
@milanmania whatever he is, he isn't Milan's that's doe damn sure. We could have used our own home breed. U never know they can't be 1/2
@milanmania its more of a waste when we are giving playing time to other team's future and not ours. I believe we won't be relegated.
@milanmania we could have used a primavera player instead. SMH

Rt if you've done this <OK HAND SIGN> 
@Milanello delusional moron!
@ACMilanSydney we won't be relegated. Forget Europe but this team needs a change ASAP.
@ACMilanSydney I believe all Milan fans at this point have accepted the shite state of the team. We are just horrible.
@TheCalcioGuy no TEAM concept. Just running around for Milan
@Milanello maybe Suso can play next game
#ChievoMilan #SerieA
@TheMilanGuys 11 individuals on the field with no chemistry and TEAM concept!!
@ACMilanSydney 11 individuals playing. No team play at all
@uk_acmilan reminiscing.....
@milanmania 10000000% AGREE WITH YOU MATE!!!!!
@RossoneriBlog Clueless fucking Inzaghi. Destro is not the problem. Midfield needs to service forwards which is lacking.
@uk_acmilan Awful sub. Put in Cerci for Menez you idiot Inzaghi. #CluelessCoach
@ACMilanChicago Inzaghi Destro is not the issue, your fucking midfield is!! Pazzo swap WONT change anything!! They both need service

Alex to Bocchetti 12 passes
Bocchetti to Montolivo 8 
Montolivo to De Jong 8 
De Jong to Bonera 9 
Bonera to A…
#ChievoMilan #SerieA


Group stage? Play-offs? 
We reveal all: 
#UELdraw 
@Planetmilan you have done enough, time to retire
@MDestroOfficial @NDJ_Official #ForzaMilan 
@AcmPassion @iMilanRossoneri that'll be stupid of management to let him leave.
@AcmPassion @iMilanRossoneri It will be stupid to sell him. He should be offered an extension and loaned out to a team like Capri or Sass
@Milanello must sign and loan to Capri to get first team experience.
#GilletteFlexball 
@ACMilanBros well said mate! He could have served Destro on multiple occasions yesterday. Shame he doesn't recognize team play
@MDestroOfficial

@milanmania delusional
#travel #nature #culture #Armenia 
@ACMilanSydney Definitely an incorrect wording.Lopez card, &amp; couple of others were 2 yellow cards. This sounds like players r killing others

6. True and consistent investment in youth and scouting
4. Being open and honest with your fan-base
2. Same Ownership, but proper investment and a true and consistent plan
@Acmilanman7 @ACMilanNewsNow yes dry loan I don't mind to get experience and back. He performs well for Primavera
@Acmilanman7 @ACMilanNewsNow Milan better sign him up
#acmilan
@AzzurroMilan Keep the youth project? I don't think that's ever started at Milan let alone to keep it.
#WildOnTino 
@ACM_SWE WOW just amazed. Are you fucking kidding me #Inzaghi??? Empoli are a great team and you can't dominate a relegation bound team???

He believes an agreement could be reached this mont…

Retweet if you agree.
@MilanEye Honda played like shit and Cerci only played 10 minutes.
@Milangirls Milan keep on breaking wrong records
@AzzurroMilan this is unacceptable! He said Cerci could play 30 mins. Only played 10
@RossoneriBlog Injuries are not the only issue. Milan needs an identity and a true tactical formation!
@uk_acmilan not as coach mate. He needs a lot of carving to get to a level to coach Milan
@uk_acmilan you are not the only one mate. Really disgusted with this shut performance
@KeinoH I watched &amp; wasn't expecting a win after the 1st half performance. It was a disgrace of a showing. Didn't deserve to win
@KeinoH my Sunday is ruined
@KeinoH Only hope can help us from this misery
@TheMilanGuys I have so much to say but just don't have the energy to spend on this horrendous, embarrassing performance. Gutted!
@KeinoH highly doubt any changes. Sign Suso and don't play him. No youth project, no tactics....
@MilanWitness keep on breaking records.
@MilanWitness Milan is far from being killers
@milanmania Embarrassed and disgusted with this performance
@milanmania Fuck off Pippo. PUPPET!!!!!
@ACMilanNorway @ACMilanClubDC NO TACTICS, NO MIDFIELD!!

Coincidence? I think not.
@RossoneriBlog "try" is the absolute correct word to use because they don't play football. Nowhere near close
@RossoneriBlog Because the rest don't give a shit about Milan and the shirt.
@ACForzaMilano @ACMilanNewsNow Midfield horrendous, just plain disgusting especially 1st half. Chasing all game to EMPOLI
@FinallyMario Say hello to my Armenian fella
@PDAcquaviva @RossoneriBlog just disgusting to watch this side play, with Menez playing like he doesn't give a shit
@ACM_SWE I don't think he deserves to play for Milan. Playing with Ibra what made him good. I hope we sell him.
@ACMilanNYC Los Angeles!!!
@MilanEye Puppet Pippo!!
@JOYPAULIAN @NicholeTJoy Congrats Ian!!!

#travel #nature 
@ACMilanSydney what a joke
@MilanEye comical
@ACMilanNewsNow I doubt they sign him
@ACMilanNewsNow that would be idiotic. I thought they wanted to cut him loose in summer

@sevsarkissian I think she will be publicly humiliated <HUSHED FACE>
@sevsarkissian hahaha. Love it. Lmao
@AzzurroMilan he does but he needs to look at Milan's midfield first and the whole starting 11 before going public with his comments
@ACMilanSydney He's trying to cover another loss doesn't matter to Juve or other provincial team so fans look elsewhere not the "real" issue
@ACMilanSydney I'm not saying Juve should get away with this but Galliani should look at his own side before publicly making those comments
@ACMilanSydney I read all of that. I think Galliani should pay attention to the garbage starting 11 before complaining.

Juventus = 2 Champions Leagues in 118 years.

@ACMilanBros Muntari should not be allowed to come near the pitch. Embarrassing performance. Lost 90% of possession for Milan
@Sakriya @ACMilanNYC he is reading off a script made for him. Puppet Pippo
-GC
@uk_acmilan I didn't know we had midfield yesterday on the pitch
@_milan___ @RYOmoha not a big deal so let's give Juve a free goal? That changed the entire game, Milan was playing decent until that goal
@milanmania he knows the outcome if he says otherwise hence reading the script. Relegation bound is this continues obviously

@milanmania or ants...he is scared of Berlu. Sell the team already so we can have a competent coach
@milanmania A simple logical standpoint, how can you play great when the team loses? He has lost the locker room. Berlu needs to go ASAP
@RossoneriBlog @ACMilanNewsNow Is Inzagji blind? Each game Essien and Muntari get the same ratings.
@milanmania grow some balls
@milanmania I'm 100% sure that's what he did. He needs to drop some balls but he might end up like Seedorf 2.0.
@milanmania self belief from the shitty game your team player Pippo? What game was he watching? Maybe drugs had some effect on what he said?
@ACMilanSydney Sneaky bastards!
@ACMilanSydney oh wow, what does Seria A have to say about that???

This guy is just brilliant. ht…

Just magnificent. #ForzaLuca 
@Milangirls at this point, GO
@rossoAnto @WiseOldBHJ @MilanForever29 the only logical explanation. Just dreadful
@Milangirls vomiting!
@milanmania @milanoonz winter mercato passed by and absolute 0 attention to most critical area of the team
@milanmania @milanoonz some kind of a change in this shitty midfield would do
@milanmania @milanoonz at least Suso. How bad is he than lumberjack Muntari or Essien?

I hope we sign Conte!
@uk_acmilan white flag is out. Accepted defeat. Does not want to lose by a higher score. Inzaghi should be fired
@milanmania @milanoonz Mastalli, Suso...ok to lose but at least with dignity.
Inzaghi logic. Losing and subbing a defender. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME????????
Juve winning and running/hustling/attacking still. Milan losing and walking/disinterested/disgraceful. Unbelievable by Inzaghi and staff
@ACMilanSydney Good, idiot Muntari should have subbed.
MUNTARI LMFAO!!!
@milanoonz @milanmania 1000%. At least give youth a try. How bad can it be??
@TheMilanGuys How bad can Suso be at this point than fucking Muntari or Essien? How bad I ask?
@AdamoRitacco Muntari and turnovers are synonyms in the dictionary!!!
@acmilan Muntari and Essien still on the pitch! Mind boggling coaching from Inzaghi. Unreal
@RossoneriBlog Defense in shambles AGAIN!!
@RossoneriTV can't watch anymore. Horrendous performance
@RossoneriBlog Muntari took his armband off to come out. Inzaghi wake up!!
@MilanDiavolo Muntari was ready to come off. Hilarious
@ACMilanSydney wow
@agiamba @PetritMusliu @joepagnelli @AdamoRitacco @OwenNeilson hahaha
@joepagnelli @PetritMusliu @AdamoRitacco @OwenNeilson @agiamba I doubt he was having a conversation
@PetritMusliu @joepagnelli @AdamoRitacco @OwenNeilson @agiamba Not crying ass wipe. Look at the picture moron!!!
@PetritMusliu @joepagnelli @AdamoRitacco @OwenNeilson @agiamba FUCK YOU MERDA!!!
@HoldTheMilan @TheMilanGuys Fuck Juve. Juve Merda!! Embarrassing from referees!!
@TheCalcioGuy agreed!
@TheCalcioGuy Matteo, don't get too excited when Juve Merda scores
@TheCalcioGuy Muntari and Essien should not be playing at all and not get close to the pitch. Suso should be given a chance
Milan midfield is shit!!! Essien and Muntari should not be considered to get close to the pitch. Horrible performance for both.
@rossoAnto he does not deserve to be on the pitch yet a captain. Give Suso a chance for God sakes. Embarrassing!!
Fucking Muntari!!! What the fuck are you doing??? Clear the damn ball you ass wipe
ANTONELLI!!!!!!!!! GOALLLLL!!!!!
@joepagnelli @AdamoRitacco @OwenNeilson @agiamba EMBARRASSING!!!!!
Tevez was offside!!! Juve Merda!!

@Planetmilan Start promoting youth already!!

In Turin now... Ready for the game tomorrow vs Juv…
@RossoneriBlog midfield looks pretty bad. Muntari and Essien are going to play.

@olympichero03 @frozenroyalty need to fix the D ASAP!
@ACMilanNorway @MaryDero75 damn! Then those pictures are correct indeed. I just hope that our mid will step up.
@milanobsession LOOOOOL
@ACMilanNorway @MaryDero75 Vidal may not play. But LOL
@torontofc @StereoSerieA wow
@MilanEye Destro, Antonelli, and Suso

@DavidLSwan I hope Muntari will be long retired by then or kicked off the team
@Milangirls it would have been better if it was a little bigger close to a 60,000 seater. Looks nice and modern.

crash (Credits: @Missxoxo168)

@LisaTashjian need to hit the panic button or it will be too late
@lakingsinsider Enough talking already, do something on the ice for the love of God!
@LisaTashjian Dean better wake up soon or no playoffs this year
@frozenroyalty Tired team. It will be to the Kings advantage if the team doesn't make the playoffs. They need to recharge their batteries!

#Respect 
@ACMilanBros we need to cut Agazzi, Zaccardo, Muntari, Nocerino, Robinho if he comes back...
@ACMilanBros Essien, Mexes, Albertazzi, Pazzini, Armero should be leaving in the summer. We have loanees coming back &amp; need to get rid of
@RitaMans love this, amazing words
@MilanEye thank God
@DavidAmoyal you and @DiMarzio kick ass. Thanks for all the ACCURATE updates!!
@TheMilanGuys @calciomercatoit Stacking up on LBs now?
@ukACMilan @ACMilanNewsNow come and get him please
@TheMilanGuys this is awesome. Need young blood in defense
@ACMilanNewsNow @DavidAmoyal I certainly hope that he will sign for Milan.
@DavidAmoyal is this a loan deal or permanent?
@DavidLSwan Munoz is not a guarantee for next season. Sampdoria, West Ham are after him. Zamp hates Galliani &amp; will do anything to avoid him
@milanmania we should have paid the €2m as he is better/younger than Paletta!
@ACMilanSydney Munoz will go somewhere else. Embarrassing by Milan for not paying 2 m for a decent/younger player
@milanmania Shit! He wasn't free of course....
@ACMilanSydney panic buys! He isn't sure if he is healthy. Unbelievable
@PeresMircea @acmilan we shall see
@PeresMircea @acmilan I don't think Pazzini will start since Destro can't play. Menez and Cerci should play up front
@PeresMircea @acmilan Antonelli much better than Bochetti, as he is used to Seria A. I think he uses him against Juve
@RossoneriBlog Lodi not needed, we are better off with current shit midfield if we are not getting Baselli
@MilanEye God help us, no Lodi please.
@DiMarzio No Lodi please....
@milanmania UNREAL!
@milanmania he should be a back up to Munoz if/when Milan gets him in summer. This summer must be an offloading session with dead weight
@milanmania agree it was better but no one left, the team consists of more than 30 players! This is insane w/o Europe.
@milanmania good point as it doesn't  happen so our youth rottens and we buy shit players each transfer window
@milanmania no one in particular, I had a general point about youth growth...
@milanmania maybe not an immediate difference but they need to grow, sitting on the bench the don't make any difference at all
@milanmania he plays more than he deserves. Youth must be given a chance. Understand the team has issues with injuries but that's no excuse
@PeresMircea @acmilan thanks mate. He should be a good back up to Munoz hopefully in summer
@milanmania Inzaghi plays him each game like he is the future. Fucking play one of Primavera players you called up, give them a chance...
@acmilan how old is Paletta?
@ACMilanBros give him couple of games
Fav for <SOCCER BALL>️


Game tonight vs Parma ... Let's get 3 points at home..<SOCCER BALL>️<REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER I + REG> 

#weareacmilan 
Cerci (Done)
Suso (Done)
Bochetti (Done)
Destro (Done)
Antonelli (Done)
Munoz (Maybe)

@_justpa_ @Giovanni__Sacco @ACMilanNYC does not deserve to be Milan's captain. Not even close
@_justpa_ @ACMilanNYC @UmbertoGandini AWESOME!!
@ACMilanNYC given up on Montolivo
@_justpa_ @ACMilanNYC @UmbertoGandini even Monto
@KaseKubrick @ACMilanNYC NDJ plays with fire &amp; deserves to be our captain. He isn't getting any younger but midfield needs to be reinforced
@ACMilanNYC I know, it would have been nice to offload him now instead of paying his high wages
@ACMilanNYC Muntari, Essien maybe Poli too
@ACMilanNYC @UmbertoGandini need to reinforce the midfield. Get rid of Essien, Muntari, Monto.......
@ACMilanNYC need to shift ALL attention to midfield now. Area that hurts Milan the most

@AzzurroMilan he is on loan till summer. He is not our player

Когда бывший игрок переживает за клуб больше нынешних ht…
@LisaTashjian Crawford indeed
@Abdo__ACM @ACMilanNewsNow need midfield  reinforced ASAP. This is our weakest link.
@TheCalcioGuy let's hope he can get service from all three in the box to finish. I just hope Menez doesn't play selfishly.

@Planetmilan yay!!
[MilanNew…
@MilanEye what an idiot!
@ItalianoCalcio wrong Milan team
@rossoAnto hoping for Cerci, Honda or Bonaventura
@MilanEye he looks happy!!!
@KeinoH Management, defense, midfield must be addressed ASAP!!!
@MilanEye bull shit Galliani ....
Image courtesy @calciomercatoit 
@MilanEye FORZA MILAN!!!
@Planetmilan another year of suffering with him. SMH

@Planetmilan when does his contract expire?
@uk_acmilan Van Ginkle is going back in the summer no hopes for him. Paulinho, Baselli would do
@uk_acmilan agreed! Need a very good defensive mid and a creative mid
@uk_acmilan same here although I heard we are not renewing NDJ's contract.
@uk_acmilan adding Paulinho would be great. Monto Muntari Essien need to leave now! Monto shouldn NOT be Milan's captain
@uk_acmilan need midfielders ASAP

@jack_lebeau @theroyalhalf @paytonchang don't count out us yet.
