Big fan of City and QPR dancing for charity, great stuff 


Think sleep is a good option. 
@TikaTakaGuy @Em_MCFC Lest we foret 
@PandaGCMC Your fault, really
@PandaGCMC Pellegrini, he writes up all the team sheets
@PandaGCMC Who invited you here
Think I need to go back to sleep, watching Demichelis play basketball now.
@NaturallyKatz Won one title, I think
@NaturallyKatz Charleston Battery
Friendly reminder that QPR were essentially relegated because Adel Taarabt refused to defend a free kick from fucking Shaun Maloney.
Talk of empty seats again on my timeline; the fuck is wrong with all you people, I thought I followed good people.
Definitely didn't drive to the pub without checking Facebook and turns out Ian slept in. Nope, definitely not that kind of dumbass.
@Calciodiction Get off my lawn, kid
@TikaTakaGuy I didn't even watch
And what guy's face
#WelcomePep 
@willsch7 Ah yes, Pellegrini, the yes man. Can't imagine Russo having great character though, no offense to the dead.
@willsch7 Feel bad for whoever Russo is, Danton too.
@Laporttila Our generation is beautiful, isn't it-- I can sit at home and calm myself "Common White Girl" and make a few stacks.
@willsch7 Mike Ashley, definitely Raymond Tusk, but with a lot more shortcomings and terrible business decisions.
@willsch7 Neil Warnock is definitely that Congressman who showed Frank his cock, whatever that weirdo's name is.
@willsch7 You know, I think I might have a bad Buzzfeed-esque article in the works here.
@willsch7 Oh, then in that case, Pardew is just that smug cunt that tries to filibuster everyone's bills.
@willsch7 Make Sherwood the house whip. #ThreeLionsForAll
@willsch7 Crystal Palace doing everyone favors, aren't they?
Not even watching the game and this is a brilliant tweet. 
wffdm - will fuck for dank memes
impj - it me papa john

mrbttb - migos are bet…
No love for DBZ but then this, lmaoooo-- you see this? @ohhpe 
@robesman you're great, robesman, and I'd buy you a juice from Verve
@WaltDied @s_mt27 Your terrible sleeping habits due to watching basketball will be like mine when watching the Prem, this is gonna be great
@TikaTakaGuy @GOLDBRlCK *airhorns*
@TikaTakaGuy @GOLDBRlCK Gotta hit my fans with some hard-hitting #TRUTHS some times 
@ohhpe Fucking herd animals; I follow them for news and nothing else. Their opinions and takes on everything are shit.
@ohhpe They're like Bleacher Report for pop culture; there's a few dudes who know what's up but almost everyone else is so out of tune.
@CowlonFullerton the hottest of all hot takes
@WarAndSetPiece very #relatable
tfw you're getting coffee with your girlfriend and you pet a dog thinking it belongs to the shop but it belongs to a random customer
@Laporttila #ACTUALLY

@AllyBongoJr If we run 4-5-1, need more pace &amp; legitimate wide options instead of Silva as a makeshift winger and Navas' one-dimensionality.
@AllyBongoJr Our transfers are iffy because we have a lot of gaps to fill; if we run a 4-4-2, need a bigger central presence.
@AllyBongoJr Think that's why I'm a fan of Koke. He's a midfield renaissance man. We're gonna need more width to make a challenge in Europe.
@AllyBongoJr and I think Fernandinho will be fine as a more defensive midfielder option.
@AllyBongoJr For the money, it's a dynasty maker-or-breaker. Max 50m, I'd go in for Pogba. Like Koke cause he's more attacking orientated
@AllyBongoJr Gündogan, Koke, Pogba, Schneiderlin-- most to least important for us.
@AllyBongoJr at recycling possession. One of the best in Europe at getting up and down the pitch too.
@AllyBongoJr Koke would be huge seeing as Yaya looks set to leave; need someone to plug that deep gap with someone who is equally talented
@AllyBongoJr Laporte and Koke, our (reasonably affordable) biggest priorities since KDB looks set to stay.
@AllyBongoJr Laporte is the dream; I'd be okay with Stones though, esp. with homegrown.
@AllyBongoJr Christ, as if their defense needed to get any better.

@HarryMellor_ Some of it, to be fair, yes
@HarryMellor_ *obscure Assassin's Creed reference*
@HarryMellor_ Disgrace if they weren't in the mold of squirrels
@HarryMellor_ Can't blame a few Renaissance men for their ambition; sounds more exciting than sitting around painting, to be honest
@HarryMellor_ I can't help but respect this and be awestruck
@HarryMellor_ I'm sorry what
@grantkirkham He's American though, didn't ya know
@TheBlandShaun Their first album is good too, forgot the name. Red album cover, I think. Glad to see you like.
@theicecreams Oh right, 13. Dang, realistically, my guess would have been Diaby.
@theicecreams putting my money on RVP or Wilshere
@Dassed Starting to regret these memes I've posted
I liked John Hay before he went mainstream
It me, John Hay 
Big John Hay fan? Name 3 of their songs

@bjb0nd bet you don't know the bridge to Bach's Pretitia in E
@jackmfootball The Hillsborough incident, the creation of Gatorade at the Uni. of Florida-- all of them good, for me at least
@jackmfootball Anything related to sports; there's one on the Pablo Escobar the Colombia GK, an NBA player who died after being drafted
@jackmfootball ESPN 30 for 30's, all of them
@ernestbaker nah, gotta be No Compadre or Señorita
@HarryMellor_ Silva playing through Agüero or Griezmann; what a beautiful thought
@HarryMellor_ The hell; I like Depay, has all the potential tangibles to be great, but how dare they disrespect Griezmann DA GAWD
@HarryMellor_ Rafa Hernandez at it again?
@WaltDied @Em_MCFC fee*
@WaltDied @Em_MCFC Gayá resigned, I thought, few gonna be astronomical then-- I'm okay with Kurzawa or Rodriguez
@WaltDied @Em_MCFC Ricky Rodriguez imo

@Em_MCFC @PandaGCMC rather him than Cresswell tbf
@bjb0nd reduce to 2/5
@WarAndSetPiece This is the Met Gala
@WaltDied surprised we haven't given Milner a contract then
@WaltDied I tried
@911_DID_BUSH @Calciodiction @Em_MCFC Nah, I do that all the time-- my dog is surprisingly really athletic though
I'm currently in political science and I gotta contain myself cause this new Vince Staples got me super turnt
@Em_MCFC @Calciodiction um 
@Em_MCFC @Calciodiction Mr. steal yo tweets 
Barzagli is literally one of the most underrated defenders ever; I swear, I almost always forget he's a real person
For any Europeans annoyed by Juventus playing Chelsea Dagger: the Chicago Blackhawks do it after every goal. Every. Goal. They play hockey.
@bjb0nd The defense though, awful
Imagine Tévez playing under Jurgen Klopp.
Wait, what the hell was that 
Gonna forget these tweets ever happened, ta
Surprised they're not drinking Corona's, wearing sombreros, and talking about how much they respect Mexican culture and history
I'm in CSUN's library and this table full of white people next to us is talking about the Pacquiao fight and Key &amp; Peele at the White House
@AllyBongoJr EXCUSES
@AllyBongoJr Says the guy who can't even use proper grammar
GOAL SCORER'S NAME IN ALL CAPITALS
When will Ronaldo realize even Kolarov is better at free kicks than him
@911_DID_BUSH @TheBlandShaun @Calciodiction It's currently a trend, especially in Cali, so legislation is still being discussed
@911_DID_BUSH @TheBlandShaun @Calciodiction Essentially hookah to-go, far as I know
@911_DID_BUSH @TheBlandShaun @Calciodiction That's a hookah pen; vapes are basically e-cigs but w/ less nicotine &amp; more flavor
@Calciodiction LOOL imagine thinking you're cool vaping but you still take the school bus
Play 56 Nights at my funeral; the whole thing, blast that shit and follow it up with Look At Wrist
@jackmfootball My only problems with him are lack of fitness and consistency. Doesn't seem to have developed well.
@jackmfootball Doesn't seem like he fits at Arsenal right now, been pushed out by several players.
That final took me 20 minutes, I will continue turning up 
Finna get HYPE for finals 
@robesman @Four_Pins surprised there's no air horn
@TikaTakaGuy LOOOOOOOOOL
@OhManItsJin Was always gonna be boring tbh
@OhManItsJin If he tells us after, it's "covering for his loss"
@OhManItsJin Not sure I can say it's different either way; if he tells us before the fight, "he's making excuses"
@OhManItsJin uhhhh the fight wasn't even close tho
@AllyBongoJr @Calciodiction not sure I need to do any dissing, he does it for me 
@AllyBongoJr yeesh, what more can a man offer than some turnt ass airhorns and constant bando references

@AllyBongoJr @Calciodiction hype in France &gt; hype in England (&lt; hype in any other European country really)
@AllyBongoJr @Calciodiction Again, don't watch much but both look physically promising, good touches now and then
@AllyBongoJr @Calciodiction Dont watch a lot of Ligue UH but that Fékir kid is pacey; Tolisso looks a good box-to-box for the future
@AllyBongoJr Like Cabella under Deschamps too; shame he plays for fucking Newcastle
@AllyBongoJr If Toulalan continues to stop time, because his hair doesn't but his legs so apparently, think he deserves a spot
@Calciodiction @AllyBongoJr He's been playing for Marseille at the 10 tho, no? Remember he was a RW at Lille
@AllyBongoJr Can see a front 4-3-3 consisted of those 3. Payet or whoever the advanced central midfielder is will have a field day.
@AllyBongoJr Was awesome for France at the World Cup, won't be shocked if he takes the golden boot at Euros or if Griezmann/Lacaz does
@AllyBongoJr Suárez, Agüero, Tévez, Benzy, Lewy for me.
@AllyBongoJr He's a lot closer than people think
@MiguelDelaney Big fan of Internet catharsis, are we

@pranavarya Easy narrative to give into imo; lot of people can't even explain why it's considered the best rap album by many people
@pranavarya Eh, I think his experimental albums are overrated— so is ranking Kanye albums but LR is his most refined album for me
@pranavarya How we gon hate on Late Registration like that

@richarddeitsch @chrissyteigen My question now is why hasn't Richard Deitsch graced a cover of Sports Illustrated
@Laporttila Lakers, given though
@jossmcfc This hashtag could definitely be misconstrued
Great save by López though, probably knows a thing or two about Gonzalo's penalty taking
Horrible penalty, the stuttered run-up and poor body positioning
TikaTaka's favorite striker, Higuaín
De Sciglio, the first foul of the game, ahahaha, Milan are so shit
Waka Flocka, what a guy 
@Dassed RIP hip-hop related puns

@HarryMellor_ Sake, but violent this, ahaha
@HarryMellor_ Kane wasn't even arsed, probably because Silva is half his size, haha
@MCFCTalk Hart or Kolarov imo
Imagine United fans singing 'kicking a blue' while Chelsea clinch the title and City finish in the top 3
Still think he should go but nice to see Kolarov still has it in him
@PranavArya 6-1 but both scorelines are ancient history
Can't make this shit up 
Unreal game from Hart
@Shrxxms Highkey upset that no one even knows what these events are
Decent morning "init" 
@Phaetonv2 Don't let any Brits know tho
@bloostoo @TikaTakaGuy That's Panda's job
On this note, congratulations to any Blues supporters I may know. Everyone else can fuck off.
I'm gonna wake up and Chelsea will probably be Premier League champions. <PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL>
@SebGVEVO It was aight
@CowlonFullerton I was looking for this fucking picture all match
There it is, I have finally scored the most FIFA goal ever 
@WarAndSetPiece when you confuse a manager with an entire club
Don't care that Chelsea are winning the title, more pissed because there's gonna be no parking at the pub, goddammit
@isayyyuh got turnt just thinking about that mixtape
@isayyyuh ahhhh why the delete tho
@isayyyuh LMAO AHAHAHHAHAHAHA this shit is genius
@AllyBongoJr oh my god, no, this is an actual penalty that will happen in stoppage time
Yup, there it is-- my last Mayweather-Pacquiao tweet for the night; tune in tomorrow for my annoying stream of tweets about #SOCCER
How much does this fight really matter if Obama hasn't pardoned Migos tho
Zeets with the hard-hitting truths tho 
@PaulBelmes cryptic reply in response to your reply to my tweet
@CaseyVeggies tryna hit that Dougie tho or wha
I've seen enough Lakers and Dodgers playoff series to know this was coming, sigh
I'm disappointed in myself for being genuinely shocked at the amount of people who became boxing experts tonight
@theicecreams We've seen enough Lakers playoff series to see this coming
@Shrxxms smh I knew Filipinos were gonna react this way, some ignorant ass people from my country <SLEEPING FACE>
Sooo, free coffee on anyone who thought Pacquiao would win or what @HollywoodMCFC
Seen better fights at Cleveland tbh
@hectr_franco loooool just facts tho
Hold on, this is actually a valid argument 
On the bright side, not even City games are as shit as that fight so tomorrow morning at the pub should be great
@bjb0nd Hard hitting truths
There were a lot of good #jokes and #tweets before this fight came on, what happened to thiss
I'm not calling myself an expert but some of y'all gotta stop talking about boxing right now.
@isayyyuh (I am Filipino, please don't roast me @internet)
@isayyyuh FILIPINOS ARE STUPID
@isayyyuh BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE
Alan Gordon actually scored, I'm in tears on the inside knowing this and I missed it
@isayyyuh LMAOOOOOO nah you actually wild for this
I missed an Alan Gordon goal for this shit
I COULD HAVE SEEN A FREE SOCCER GAME BUT I WATCHED THIS SHIT
@isayyyuh DO IT FOR THE CONTENT
@isayyyuh Do it just for the #SOCIALMEDIA to be honest
@isayyyuh Really don't want another one of these shitfests
Sad but true 
This concludes my expert analysis of boxing. Gonna go watch some real boxing aka that episode of SpongeBob with the TV box.
Nice to know we have some clever humor on Twitter, sucks it had to be during he most overhyped sporting event of all-time.
Never really felt Pacquiao was up for this. Always over-aggressive, just throws more punches than the other. What a shit fight.
Can't hate on Mayweather. His only style is getting the job done; reads everyone well, knows how to counter, quick.
It's official: boxing is no longer relevant.
JUST FACTS 
Pacquiao gonna win 2-1 as karma for the Bradley decision
That fight sucked, I hate all of you
George Clooney didn't die for this
Only way Pacquiao wins is if Shane McMahon comes and steel chairs him, giving him the belt via DQ #MayPac
Pacquiao pulls off the most famous knockout in history or Mayweather runs away with the scorecard on the most overhyped sporting event ever.
This is supposed to be the most coveted fight in history. I want to see a knockout; don't care who it is.
Aight, I'll see y'all in a bit
The real fight of the night is between Run DMC impersonator Jimmy Kimmel and the Burger King
If Floyd was real, he woulda brought out President Palmer for this

Mayweather &amp; Pacquiao walking out to the ring is good, but is it Darren Fletcher back at Old Trafford-good
@ghostfacequillo Because of this, Clippers were able to read it-- Spurs ran the same play and Clippers easily defended it (2/2)
@ghostfacequillo Buzzer (1 sec left) went off early and the Spurs were already beginning to run their play off the inbounds pass (1/2)

@GoomihoLoL You wouldn't know the difference if you watched him play
@GoomihoLoL Dilly Duka is my favorite example of alliteration in American sports
Thank the lord we can change back to the stupid new MLS logo instead of looking at Montreal's every time.
State of the MLS when we rely on a team starting Dilly Duka and Jack MacInerney to win the CCL.
Ironic that the best defense of Chelsea comes from Gary Neville. Good point though.

@LegDisabled Skepta is the only grime artist I see being highlighted, so there's that
@LegDisabled before I make any judgment on grime in general
@LegDisabled Haven't taken the time to delve into the grime scene; I've heard bits of Skepta and like it, but want to dedicate serious time
Tunes for the week 
Remember getting my first taste of @towkio with World Turning. Finally .WAV Theory out so I can give this dude love <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@Calciodiction @jackmfootball @TikaTakaGuy @PandaGCMC Joe and his fucking folder of GIFs
@Calciodiction @TikaTakaGuy @PandaGCMC @jackmfootball @kickstothepitch
@Calciodiction @TikaTakaGuy @PandaGCMC @jackmfootball When Joe abruptly shifts the convo to fashion
@Phaetonv2 The inevitable appeals tho
@PandaGCMC @TikaTakaGuy @jackmfootball Fernando actually
@PandaGCMC @TikaTakaGuy @jackmfootball You're aware Lampard is 36
@TikaTakaGuy @jackmfootball @PandaGCMC Least I don't have the Panda curse
@TikaTakaGuy @jackmfootball @PandaGCMC He thinks Wilshere is good, someone has to be sincere
@jackmfootball @TikaTakaGuy @PandaGCMC For our club captain who's led us to 2 titles, overpriced prick ain't he
#nowplaying 
@PandaGCMC @jackmfootball @TikaTakaGuy Good man, don't say anything and jinx us
Great ideas from Emilio: voluntarily playing football for an hour in 90° weather
@Dassed No love for Towkio, John, have some courtesy, mate
@Calciodiction @HuwgoBoss Huddlestone imo
@Calciodiction He's a hardman/midfield destroyer though, didn't you know
@willsch7 @Calciodiction I mean, supporting Arsenal and not liking Ramsey...
@willsch7 @Calciodiction There's a division, isn't there: Wilshere and Rambo fanboys?
@Calciodiction Arsenal fans clinging onto whatever hope they have about Wilshere; needs to get fit and be eased in
@Calciodiction That's like a City fan having a Fernando @; hope he proves us all wrong, but until then, could care less about him
@WaltDied @Calciodiction beef
@Calciodiction Imagine caring about Wilshere when you have Ramsey, Coq and Santi
@Calciodiction People like this really exist
Fam, shouldn't you be putting all that money on a better college
This guy walking thru Eucalyptus Hall dead ass wearing the Nike x Supreme jersey, Versace shirts and Birkenstocks
@TikaTakaGuy da GOAT
Proving again that no one cares about The Game 
@ernestbaker love how we're (rightfully) ignoring every "beef" that involves Chris Brown

@hectr_franco Social media is beautiful #LEVELS
@hectr_franco When social injustice going off but you gotta defend yourself, lol smh
In an effort to make my timeline seem a lot less sinister, here are some pictures of our dog 
This being said, that's still out of this world... $58 billion...
Aren't we in the second quarter? 
@PaulBelmes Bet you won't throw hands though
@PaulBelmes I'm used to hearing that over my Xbox headset
@PaulBelmes #thingswhitepeoplesay
@PaulBelmes old joke
@CowlonFullerton Is this what it's really like to live in the Midwest
@Shrxxms wait noooooooo this ain't right <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>


Well, damn. That makes the US military budget an even bigger waste. Let's fund school…
@ohhpe New @ opegotjokes <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Phaetonv2 That feeling when someone tries turning you out and you put the arm of shame across their chest
Harsh truth. 
Amateur hour for Isles' defense, cut open like scissors through fabric
Lord, what a save by Halak
Not sure how to feel; have lunch, take a nap, then suddenly a whole city is burning. I don't pray but hope everyone in Baltimore is safe.
@PranavArya I rate Carrick but christ, the state of football twitter
@PranavArya Probably think Khedira is a CDM because it's his position on FIFA
@PranavArya They can't even decide if Ramsey is better than Wilshere, what more do you expect
@HarryMellor_ Yeah, I realized that and am now convinced he gets all his stuff from Arsène
@HarryMellor_ Probably grows, smart man he would be then
@HarryMellor_ Word on the street is he knows where to pick up a good eighth
@HarryMellor_ Can't fault a man's dedication to his club
@HarryMellor_ Notice how he pointed out Wilshere and not Ramsey, that's how you can tell he's daft
@HarryMellor_ He's riling us up, mate, don't fall into the trap
@HarryMellor_ You're talking about Jack, right
Love me some Stu Holden
@PandaGCMC @jackmfootball This is a sackable offense
@bjb0nd and Sinclair*
Gonna be great when we drop points against Bournemouth after leading by 2 goals and we narrowly grind out a 4-2 win at Dean Court
Paul Carr, ladies and gentlemen. 
Bournemouth play some beautiful football for a now-former Championship club, don't wanna sound rash but they play "proper" football
@FutbolChief The infamous ohwhatitsmeels, banned from all Duncan-related forums for my hard-hitting truths
Can't help but say congratulations to @afcbournemouth; also, you're welcome for the free draw or win we gift you, courtesy of @MCFC
@FutbolChief Who are you to judge good tweets when you're using football memes/templates
@FutbolChief Sake, a 12 year old take over your account
@bjb0nd Won't be shocked; they really should be consistent top half contenders but everything they do is fucked
@bloostoo Albert Rusnák did well at Cambuur, earned him a move to Groningen
@bjb0nd Nah, Southampton's model is (over-romanticized but) so so smart-- Newcastle, all down to Mike Ashley (and their shit support)
@bjb0nd Typical English club with decent amount of money and supporters but throw it all away; QPR next, then
@bjb0nd Bournemouth are running out Bolton right now, Premier League beckons
@bjb0nd Going HAM on the core, them*
Hell of a goal, that
@willsch7 @SantiCathorla EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE SET TO ERECT THE ARCH OF VICTORY
@SantiCathorla @willsch7 Riven still slipped <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #YNWA #YoullNeverWinAgain
@willsch7 @SantiCathorla League's Facebook top replies are all "still faster than your servers" and "Ashe <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️" when the post is about Riven
@willsch7 @SantiCathorla Oh my god, imagine using football twitter templates for eSports, glorious
@willsch7 @SantiCathorla Just give me $5 already
@willsch7 @SantiCathorla $5 says it's better than football twitter
@willsch7 @SantiCathorla eSports*
@SantiCathorla When you thought your joke was good but you have to explain it
@SantiCathorla gdi I really thought this was good

any way, the tournament was called "Heroes of the Dorm" and UC-Berkeley won
@SantiCathorla "The dorm belongs to California"

says Bob from North Dakota
@CowlonFullerton They were all about my size though but I'm still putting it down on my Squawka
@CowlonFullerton I bodied three people yesterday though, never been prouder
@CowlonFullerton I also cannot dribble for my life so it's either that or forward that runs a lot
@CowlonFullerton I'm terrible one-on-one defending usually tbh, I'm just good at occupying space and making clearances/blocks
@CowlonFullerton My natural position is defender/anything defensive so I often forget to use my hands
@CowlonFullerton It is indeed scary
@CowlonFullerton I was keep for a bit and made three saves with my thighs yesterday; wishing I just let those in now
@CowlonFullerton Like how LOL
@CowlonFullerton The hell, even that doesn't happen to me
@DanThomasESPN Perfect water cooler talk, I imagine-- Craig must be beaming at the idea of watching broke college kids play video games
@DanThomasESPN What about the video games, Dan, these are important questions
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE 
@OhManItsJin LEVELS 
@ohhpe Who doesn't
@OhManItsJin You're on the wrong side of the tracks then
@GoomihoLoL No one I follow at least
@GoomihoLoL It's fun because no one takes it too seriously
@OhManItsJin That was an hour ago; we've comfortably moved on to witty pop culture/MOBA jokes
@GoomihoLoL When two worlds collide
I'm gonna stop now
I'm still having fun with this if you haven't noticed
ASU never deserved the title, Berkeley play beautiful football, they don't park the bus
No SEC team in a Heroes of the Dorm final, not paying the kids enough, eh
@ESPNFC @Paul_Mariner @AleMorenoESPN @SteveNicol61 ask Stevie and Craig how they feel about video games on ESPN2
Not sure how I haven't lost any followers after tonight
I literally have never had more fun with social media and TV, fuck me
AND THE BAND IS ON THE FIELD
@PabloTorre G.
SO MUCH DAMAGE BEING DEALT
ESPNFC would have ended 19 minutes ago, wow, what a world
THIS IS A DISASTER
Somewhere in heaven, Leeroy Jenkins is watching ESPN2 screaming, "IT'S LIT"
@bjb0nd NO SHAME
Gonna be interesting to see how Berkeley deal with ASU's high press, they're not very comfortable with the ball at their feet
@desusnice Wait, don't tell me you're not watching ESPN2 right now
Oh thank god, Suppy got away #GoldenBears
@PabloTorre They're better than Americans trying to do soccer, I'll give them that much credit
Dragons are making chaos on ESPN, this is not a drill
THERE IS A FUCKING DRAGON
Eagerly awaiting the Bleacher Report notification for whoever wins this
Kind of disappointed I haven't heard one of these commentators yell "SQUAD"
@bomani_jones nah nah nah, I need to get your opinion on this virtual witchcraft going on on ESPN2
@LegDisabled Interesting life John Hay lives, what a man
@LegDisabled Just feeding off the trend I guess, can't blame them
I've got about 5 people explaining the rise of MOBAs and the implications of eSports to me, I love social media
@GoomihoLoL ahhhh didn't think of that; seems more interesting than gathering resources and building a base, eh
@SebGVEVO I see, ty ty
My entire timeline is watching eSports, this is glorious
@GoomihoLoL There was multiple player team functionality in both, wasn't there?
@LegDisabled Why are these so many successful cookie cutter MOBA games
@OhManItsJin smhhhh you not on that barb-Whirlwind/sorc-Frozen Orb hype
@GoomihoLoL But isn't this almost every game; it's the basis for Starcraft and (OG) Warcraft
@OhManItsJin D2 &gt;&gt;&gt;
Like why do we have so many of these games, the closest I've gotten to this is downloading DOTA and not finishing the tutorial
Can a MOBA expert explain to me what the difference is between each game besides having less shitty communities in every game that isn't LoL
@OhManItsJin I played Warcraft 3 and Diablo II, fuck you kids and your damn heroes, and get off my lawn while you're at it
@OhManItsJin I DONT PLAY MOBAS THIS IS LIKE THE 4TH REPLY
Do yourself a favor and turn to ESPN2
@CowlonFullerton Chris' face = America
I don't even play any online multiplayer games, this is so awesome
ESPORTS ARE THE FUTURE #LEVELS 
Got damn, eSports are not a joke 
@CowlonFullerton tbf to gamers, it's better than following import models, jacking off daily and proclaiming myself a "Meninist"
@CowlonFullerton tfw you realize your obsession with sports and music is no different from people's obsession with video games
Also, one of these teams goes to Berkeley so they've already defeated me in this sense
This is one time where I cannot ironically reply with "NERDS" in all caps because one of these teams is gonna win 3 years tuition
No really, this game really got live national coverage on ESPN2-- this is the new age, people, let's make some fucking money
I need a finances report and breakdown of the top 5 most popular MOBAs
@CowlonFullerton what kind of American are you
@SebGVEVO I only did it for the pic tbh
Additional shout out for making me realize that this is Heroes of the Storm and not League
@GoomihoLoL I played Warcraft III if that qualifies me
@GoomihoLoL I DONT PLAY ESPORTS
@GoomihoLoL I imagine @Twitch must be pissed about this
Shout out to my eSports correspondent @GoomihoLoL for opening my eyes
League on ESPN2 #welcometo2015 
@GoomihoLoL Wait, holy shit, it's really on ESPN2, I thought you were joking
Might have to trademark "Pappa tucks in"
Nice, intricate play from Seattle-- look good when Pappa tucks in and links up with Dempsey/Oba/vice versa
Not the most exciting opener I've ever seen in a Cascadia Cup
@PabloTorre Actually, this is The-Dream 
@CowlonFullerton Think the original was pretty spot on tbf
@CowlonFullerton Like what kind of millennial lives with the perspective of "I only listen to pre-Revolution strings arrangements"
@CowlonFullerton That's so exotic/foreign to me I can't even imagine
@CowlonFullerton Imagining you dating a girl blasting Migos and Young Thug
Good save from Bendik now
@jackmfootball <NAIL POLISH>🏻
@jackmfootball love you, mate
What a save from Ricketts
@jackmfootball Blackmail now, goodness
@jackmfootball Hitting the pipe again, I see
@K_Debbz Sake, this is what I get for listening to Facebook's recommendations, ahaha
@JordanKatzby also "gotta big ass point"
@JordanKatzby tfw when you realize satire might kinda be dead
@Laporttila Ray Allen's game-tying 3 in '13 Finals and D-Lillard's series-clinching 3 against Houston last year were crazy too
@Laporttila Malice at the Palace/Pacers-Pistons '04 fight, easily
@TheBlandShaun The original with just the strings and horns &gt;&gt;&gt;
@TheBlandShaun I haven't watched WWE in ages to be honest but that theme amuses the hell out of me

Reasons football twitter is <PUT LITTER IN ITS PLACE SYMBOL> 
@jackmfootball it seems like
@jackmfootball I've heard arguments from people of color I know, in school, that are for and against rules like this; matter of perspective
@jackmfootball Agree; it's like affirmative action for managers, bar extraordinary cases of discrimination, rules like this aren't necessary
@WaltDied "you finished 7th" "Gerrard still slipped" "Arsenal love 4th" "Moyes" "Mourinho"
@WaltDied So many people think they're funny, 99% of it is just awful
@jackmfootball Rooney Rule is requirement to interview person of color for managerial positions, correct
Not sure why I expect football twitter to be entertaining in any capacity after a big club plays, always full of shit
@WaltDied @Dassed And throwing Navas under the bus
@Dassed Hard to believe we've scored the most goals in the league
@NaturallyKatz Johnson has always been the best American player (imo) but he's not a flashy player and doesn't play a sexy position.
"Love me some Benny Feilhaber" - said no one ever 
Not that I was ever in shape, I'm just saying
After playing soccer for about two hours, I've come to the conclusion that I am out of shape
@ohhpe his, yet the whole article seems pretty set on borderline vilifying him-- so I'm unsure what he really thinks of Travis himself
@ohhpe Wow, pretty fascinating-- I'm just confused because the article saves face by saying Scott's rise is more the industry's fault than
@ohhpe What makes you say that; he seems like a typical Internet personality (for a rapper), seemed cool when I saw him &amp; Thug
@Laporttila @johncrossmirror
Like a Brazilian Zidane, that beautiful man
Imagine how good we'd be if Pellegrini took 10 minutes to google "high block" and "low block"
Mike Dean must be real fun at parties
State of goalkeeping in this league
Might end up redacting this tweet
Imagine not beating a team starting Kieran Richardson
And there it is, Kolarov's annual display of talent-- emphasis on annual
look at GAWD
@FutbolChief Moral victories, the only victories that matter in the Prem
Clapped when Lampard went off for Milner, not sure what I was clapping
@FutbolChief Awkward moment when United spend £150m and still finish behind Arsenal and Chelsea

The stats that really matter: how the top 4 stack up #CFC #AFC #MUFC #MCFC 
@ohhpe Born/raised in Stone Mountain but he reps the ATL, they're close, aren't they
@ohhpe Fuckin' Ope got me thinking now-- forgot CyHi, Killer Mike and 'Bino were all from the ATL, only remembered Migos and Future
@ohhpe Easy-- Chicago: Ye, Lupe, Common, Cool Kids, drill/trap scene, SAVEMONEY

@AllyBongoJr Think many people were curious as to how they would handle Walker's sudden death
@AllyBongoJr Yeah, the numbers it's racked up is insane, really can't explain
@AllyBongoJr Nah, I don't feel like that. I def. feel like it escalated interest in their films, no offense to PW, but it was already big.
@Scrizzler Assless chaps aren't for everyone, apparently
@AllyBongoJr The first two are really good, Tokyo Drift was aight; everything else is just smoke and mirrors

@Calciodiction @LegDisabled innit
@LegDisabled @Calciodiction Plot twist: the eighth is for Joe's grandma
@Calciodiction @LegDisabled That emoji = Joe's face when he realized he's been found out
@LegDisabled @Calciodiction As if Joe has time to meddle in England when he's too busy oppressing lower class families in France or Spain
@City_Watch Tuchel uses a high block; this move implies Džeko has to actually, you know, move his legs

@JamesTylerESPN Little does the media know, Dr. Müller-Wohlfahrt resigned only to be reunited with Guardiola at Milan
@JamesTylerESPN I see your point with Berlusconi though, alas we were deprived of the joke
@JamesTylerESPN Was he praising Allegri?

@Calciodiction Posting on two social networks, smh
I couldn't think of anything funny so I just made a genuine tweet, kind of disappointed myself really.
Friendly reminder for 4/20: when it's your turn to pass, don't be an asshole, pass it.
Hillary's campaign has to center on freeing Migos, Max B and Bobby Shmurda 
Unironic 4/20 tweet

@___bg__ Forest Hills Drive, If You're Reading This, Cherry Bomb, B4.DA.$$-- all decent albums that got massively overrated.
@___bg__ Rap community groupthink-esque; if it's hype, people are inclined to say it's good I feel like, lots of decent albums overrated.
@Calciodiction Not rebranding every day
@Calciodiction Here I was, thinking we made some progress
@___bg__ Every album gets overrated nowadays but been really good
Looks like I made the right decision to sleep immediately as the Milan derby starts
beIN showing commercials for the Milan derby with images of Ronaldinho and Zanetti, as if they both couldn't get into these teams

Really good game, this
@AllyBongoJr Bring Klopp and tell Dortmund to fuck off so we can snatch Gundogan, Reus, Aubameyang and Piszczek
@AllyBongoJr We're getting Klopp, m8
@WaltDied Laporte tho
@WaltDied I'd still take him, fight me
The thought of even having one of Laporte, Varane or Hummels with Mangala <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@WaltDied @Calciodiction Was it that volley that bounced under Mignolet, something like that
@Calciodiction @WaltDied Jovetić doesn't exist, he's just a figment of your imagination.
@WaltDied @Calciodiction Nah, he's been shit-- remember that we ruined him on his debut earlier this season
Mangala has been incredible today. I'm convinced for the first time this season, outside of the Chelsea game.
@Phaetonv2 One of the few enlightened
Anthony Taylor hit the pipe before this game?
City have played an entire 45 minutes and I haven't wanted to off myself. Making good progress this season, bit late though.
And breathe.
@bjb0nd I'm almost scared by how alike it is
@LegDisabled It's cool though, he has very diff. sound/content for hip-hop, then suddenly there's electronic, gets artsy, really cool
@LegDisabled I dislike 808's and Yeezus but I don't fault his progressiveness and creativity; one of the few successful to do it mainstream
@Phaetonv2 Stephen A. Smith proverb
@LegDisabled Was gonna list my favorites but listening to his discography in order sounds like a good idea
@LegDisabled early stages of a lady killer
@LegDisabled Late Registration, his best work imo
@LegDisabled I predicted the future and started wearing Nike before City did 
@LegDisabled ayyyyy
@LegDisabled THE ATHLETIC ROOSTER
"You know why I'm here" - Gucci Mane at EDC next year 
"IT'S LIT" - Twitter proverb 
@LegDisabled Might leave before final time and do a cheeky Nando's
@LegDisabled If I didn't have the City fans here at the pub, I'd be stuck here on Twitter wanting to off myself
@LegDisabled I've only been an actual fan of football for about 3 years now and Twitter has ruined everything for me
@LegDisabled tbf when Arsenal are consistent, they're a joy to watch
@LegDisabled Survey says no but who actually cares any more
This kind of got my own hopes up tbh
Remember when I asked Metro if he was gonna do a collab with Danny Brown and people actually thought an imminent song was coming
@MiguelDelaney What kind of burrito tho
Need to finish articles, want to play football, it's also hot-- hard life decisions here
@LegDisabled Don't give in to football twitter
@LegDisabled Totally forgot you had this
It needs to be done 
Why is Mourinholic on my timeline, that's like 4 people with a RT or reply
@Dassed I swear, he's just an urban myth, A figment of my imagination
@Dassed People still like that guy, what the fuck
Only thing I'm looking forward to is Leicester beating the drop and QPR un-ironically getting relegated
We Premier League fans try to justify losing and find silver linings; all cool, but y'all need to accept losses for what they are
Why are United fans trying to justify losing; love you all, but this is stupid, Chelsea were always going to win
Can we all stop fighting and just admit that every team in the Prem was shit this year minus Chelsea but even they lost to PSG
@SquadraDaMorire Or United... Or City... Or Liverpool...
@PranavArya @drenged @FutbolChief Well aware, never really understood the point of the move.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief Maybe it's just me. If Falcao were with us, I'd be furious.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief Bit disappointing for the supposed best striker in the world behind Messi though.
@Dassed Then fucking Federici, awful day for football this
@Dassed I want to be happy for our friends but I fucking dread this squad under Mourinho
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief For his money? Eh.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief No Carrick or Blind, also if Falcao wasn't shit.
Timeline is tactical complaining and Chelsea fans. Just as I expected.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief Yeah, their wide defense was sketchy. Too bad Shaw and Valencia couldn't hit water if they were at sea.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief Hard to judge when we're talking a team with 30% possession that parked the bus. Ancient history though.
@Dassed You're one of the few enlightened, my friend.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief Eh, I detest Mourinho, but they took their chance and kept the lead. No one complains when Atletí does it.
@drenged @PranavArya @FutbolChief Two clear cut chances doesn't make a good game; boring as it was, Chelsea's defense is incredible
@TikiTaktics I've wondered forever why your fans don't rate Carrick; it's like City fans who didn't rate Fernandinho
@RapDescendant Purposely stayed off Twitter for this match, must've been awful
@RapDescendant I swear we find new arguments for each top 6 club every month
@RapDescendant Is this the new argument for/versus Chelsea
PSA: @joehart @daviddegea @adamfederici CLOSE YOUR LEGS
@Dassed I Got Drunk With The Guy From Manchester Who Wears Food Hats During Sex, my article here:
@Dassed Sorry, I think you're looking for @VICE
This league is so bad that it's great, they're like another MLS but their defense is even worse
I decided to do something I've never done in FIFA and that's play in the Korean league
@NaturallyKatz King Fahd = da GOAT
@Dassed @Calciodiction you know he would, the fuck
@Calciodiction @Dassed I figured we'd have one over whacking it but those tissues say other wise *self five*
@Calciodiction I don't know what to do any more @Dassed
@Calciodiction @jessiebee394 IT TOOK YOU THREE TIMES
@jessiebee394 Can my buddy get in on this @Calciodiction
Three inevitable things in life: death, taxes, and the Canucks being dick in the playoffs
@Calciodiction Man actually replied with a Kevin Hart gif, sake
@Calciodiction Reconsidering your qualifications that I technically never received
@Calciodiction pfft, co-workers, back to work *whip crack*
Gotta hear both sides 
@Calciodiction NERD
@Laporttila Maybe FIFA deserves more credit for realism, even got the injury right lool
@Calciodiction They was really good; crowd was a bit dead, don't think very many knew their new album. But Chaz sounds as great live.
@Calciodiction Complex? Sake, I got my own business to worry about. No offense to Complex tho.
@Calciodiction I mean, how many other bands do you know that have a frontman with an afro out of the 80s and start with the word "toro"?
@Laporttila Ah, well have fun with that. Make lots of money, court all the womyns.
@Laporttila What're you doing, any way
@Laporttila Antti actually being productive-- lies, I say
@ohhpe LMAOOO nah, you just ain't right for this tweet <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@bjb0nd I swear to god you secretly work there
@JordanKatzby Alas, poor Yorick
@JordanKatzby Genre crossovers are usually a one-time thing/unique project
@JordanKatzby They don't have any songs together though unless you count the All Day remix

@Calciodiction y u mad tho
@chelpsea NERD
@chelpsea penne imo
@chelpsea I only speak the truth
@chelpsea only if you have bad manners or you like it rough tbh
@chelpsea nice pasta and garlic bread dinner simultaneously along with sex imo

Can't believe I forgot Kagawa.
We should do a throwback and take Klopp along with Felipe Santana, Kehl, and Sahin. Gonna be great when we finish 6th.
@TypicalCity Were you left naked in the wilderness for two weeks or what
To be honest, I would take Klopp, only if we told Blatter to fuck off and we bought Hummels, Piszczek, Reus, and Gundogan. That'd be great.
@TikaTakaGuy Don't think I wanna see Fernando and Fernandinho trying to press Barcelona or Bayern a la Klopp (key word: trying)
Not sure if the board would be happy with his counterpressing style. They seem pretty set on wanting to become Barcelona 2.0 at this point.
@bjb0nd need a fucking yacht at this point
Really like Klopp but don't think he can get City up and running within the next season.
You must be proud @arnettwill  
@HarryMellor_ @Em_MCFC Always knew he was better than that fraud Ronaldo
@HarryMellor_ @Em_MCFC Martínez comeback and Quaresma realizing his potential for one night too, lmao
@snakespice Varane tho
@em_mcfc Dante, Boateng, Alonso, Neuer all decided to have the worst nights in their careers all on the same night
@snakespice fuck you man, I had to google it and everything
@snakespice Szczęsny
@bjb0nd and gain 2000 followers and finally unfold my plan for WORLD DOMINATION
@scrizzler like it sounds like that would hurt your tits
@scrizzler sounds weird
@cowlonfullerton @football__tweet All the more impressive tbf
@bjb0nd Chelsea should replace Anelka with Luis Fabiano #tweetlikeits2010
@squadradamorire christ
@bjb0nd Suso, Ballon d'Or winner by 2018
@tikatakaguy This tweet now means Bayern are in
@bjb0nd Is this the time where I point out that Pedro is Barcelona's most important player
@squadradamorire If this gets numbers, might have to start questioning life
@theblandshaun @dassed You say this and yet, it would be the greatest thing on the Internet
Always knew van der Wiel had it in him #tweetlikeits2010
Upside of PSG tie: Mangala doesn't look like the *worst* transfer for a defender

C'est la vie, El Pistolero
@Laporttila Figured you were in it for the Asian Pretty Ladies
Thiago, what a man
@HuwgoBoss 2012-2013 Prem was personal hell having to watch Michu twist his fucking hand 15/20 times
@HuwgoBoss What celebration do you hate the most, Huw
@TikaTakaGuy *waits for person with Zabaleta avi to say Agüero and Džeko*
@HarryMellor_ I was jokingly blaming you for jinxing Bayern
@MenInBlazers Feel like you had this in your drafts for Steve McClaren in 2007
@HarryMellor_ Your fault
Turns out Guardiola is resigning so Klopp will become president-- no wait, that's House of Cards
WAIT WHAT LOL
@JamesTylerESPN Hugo Lloris*
@jackmfootball Don't speak ill of the Low Sock Assassin
Wait what, Porto LOL
@jackmfootball He's not even in Europe. Board probably wanted it as well, not that I can assume. Arsène finishes top 4 at least.
DOES THIS LADY NOT HAVE A FIRST NAME??? 
@desusnice Tell why Hernandez gotta be sentenced on One Boston Day tho

@Dassed What are you, Joe
@chelpsea "Ease them into me" fucking Freudians
@Dassed I'm 9 songs in and Brown Stains is the first song I really like
@Dassed People are loving it apparently, some have called him N.E.R.D 2.0
@chelpsea WHERE DO THESE EVEN COME FROM
@Dassed Yeah, this shit is super confusing
@chelpsea Now I'm a hipster, lord, this is well and truly uncalled for
@chelpsea Cool kids listened to things like Arctic Monkeys and The Strokes, come on now
@chelpsea ffs now you're just accusing me of things, this is totally unwarranted
@chelpsea You're talking to a guy who listened to oldies and rap and enjoyed American Psycho and The Godfather when I was like 6
@chelpsea I quite literally have never heard her name uttered in my life
@patriciugh i know right
@patriciugh cool
@patriciugh how unfortunate
@patriciugh that's cool
@patriciugh fuck you
@chelpsea FFS YOU'RE A #FRAUD
@chelpsea IS IT EVEN A GOOD SHOW, HONESTLY
@chelpsea Wow, what a dick, I thought it was funny
@chelpsea Alas, it was too late for me 
@chelpsea could've have been more Tory if it were Middle English
@chelpsea 90210 FFS
@chelpsea I literally had to Google
@chelpsea WE HAVE CAPITALIZATION FOR A REASON
@chelpsea YOU REALLY THINK I'VE SEEN 90210, WHO DO YOU THINK I AM
@chelpsea ffs state of this convo
@chelpsea Which doubly offends me since we're both American
@chelpsea I quite literally thought you just called me a Tory
@chelpsea ffs let's just ignore the initial issue at hand
@chelpsea This immediately piqued my interest because it's implied someone has actually done this and it's on the Internet
Can't recall a single episode of Yogi Bear, I just picture Yogi going "HEYYY BOO BOO" on a loop in my head like a Vine
Hood Politics might be my favorite song on To Pimp a Butterfly just because it reminds me of Yogi Bear.
@Dassed I try 
@Dassed Those cousins of yours? Boo boo.
@Dassed Blast Hood Politics and describe everything you dislike as boo boo
Still one of the GOAT Mean Tweets 
@Dassed Can't fault the creativity on this
@Dassed How dare you, he is an American treasure
@Dassed Only pop classics we acknowledge 
@Dassed He went from Three 6 to Katy Perry, YEESH
@Dassed Why are you acknowledging that travesty of a song
@Dassed Don't do this, John
@Calciodiction Nah, that's just fucked ahaha
@desusnice Nah, you ain't right for this, ahaha

@Calciodiction @AllyBongoJr WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY PICTURES
@Calciodiction @AllyBongoJr NONCE
Scott is legitimately shocked that I own several pairs of shorts, not sure if this is genuinely funny or our sense of humor is really dry
@AllyBongoJr @Calciodiction Depressed? I'm disturbed by Joe publicly discussing handjobs, let alone him getting one.
@Scrizzler shorts on shorts on shorts 
@Scrizzler 
@Scrizzler In case, my professor wanna fuck around and get dunked on for the sake of education
@Scrizzler You kidding me, got to have my #layers-- boxers, shorts, pants = maximum comfort
@Scrizzler For the record, I own basketball shorts but not cargos, trunks, anything like that
@Scrizzler 50/50
@Scrizzler I learned how to when I was 4 but never swam for more than a decade so I quite literally forgot
@Dassed @WaltDied Says the guy who suggested photoshopping Joe getting a handjob
Shout out to @Passionweiss for this article which (figuratively) has dying laughing; in short, Drake is a schmuck 
@Dassed I was afraid you were gonna say this
@Dassed Joe's head on some bougie person's head from the French Renaissance
@ohhpe Oh, and did you need specific pieces? Opinions, reviews, etc.
@ohhpe What expectations did you have as in how often do we need to submit pieces?

@TheBlandShaun But personnel always been the main problem
@TheBlandShaun His tactics are shit too tbf
@jackmfootball Don't want to sound bitter or elitist but CCL seems like it's for the smaller countries/leagues.
@jackmfootball The only quality leagues in CONCACAF are MLS and MX any way. CCL barely makes any money, not worth the hassle.
@jackmfootball Yeah, not sure why we're so fascinated by the idea of winning it. Credit to anyone who makes it far but not worth it for me.
@jackmfootball I recall an article or quote from Garber, the commissioner, saying he wanted to add 2/4 more teams.
@jackmfootball Unless the MLS maintains the salary cap and continues distributing revenue equally.
@jackmfootball and TV revenues won't give former NASL clubs (whatever the lower div. is) the power to fight.
@jackmfootball Only problem is no owner will voluntarily accept promotion/relegation. MLS doesn't make enough money for parachute payments
@jackmfootball Can't believe we're expanding the playoffs, just ridiculous. Draft is useless too; very few become national team caliber.
@jackmfootball Oh sure, ignore the follow up tweet that actually addresses the topic of discussion
@jackmfootball Seriously though, our league has so much potential and it's really being developed poorly
@jackmfootball Nice to know you actually speak reason sometimes
@HuwgoBoss The spin after Clichy's deflection, graceful like a swan or Kroos jumping into Khedira's arms when Germany scored against Brazil
@Shrxxms Only until then
@BrxndonT Not as much, bandwagon Chargers fan but liked them as a kid
@BrxndonT Yeah, as long as I can remember
@BrxndonT Apparently my vision is as bad as our players' is, welp
@BrxndonT I'll take this as a compliment
@Shrxxms Until someone can compress it into a headline or series of tweets, no one will care
@Shrxxms Because no one understands it and doesn't want to take time to understand it
@Mitrogol 
@Laporttila 
@Mitrogol Will do
@Mitrogol 
@TikiTaktics Eh? Carrick didn't do anything first 15. We began conceding possession after 1st goal and our marking was abysmal after that.
@Laporttila Poor guy, I'm impressed you've made it this far-- TheCescPistol lool
@Laporttila lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo this is golden
"Bucks in 6" 
@CowlonFullerton I swear we've done this before

@jossmcfc @City_Watch Sounds like they're trying to make the guy disappear, ahaha.

@Scrizzler @Calciodiction @guba1a @ghostfacequillo @snakespice I live in a low income neighborhood so

@Calciodiction @Scrizzler @snakespice Nah, think they're ugly. Neutral Old Skool's only, fam.
@Calciodiction @Scrizzler @snakespice ffs it was cold when I drove to the pub
@snakespice @Calciodiction @Scrizzler Nah, stopped that after #sophomore year
@Calciodiction @Scrizzler @snakespice #FASHION 
@AllyBongoJr after an embarrassing lost and being out of automatic qualification do we start acknowledging it. Late reality check, this.
@AllyBongoJr Anger just boiling to a high. Understandable; I'm annoyed because I always thought we've had problems, even last year but only
@snakespice @Scrizzler I own no shorts and no tank tops, I'm committed to the #FASHION
@AllyBongoJr Even Sergio. Love the man and bless him for saving our spoils today but he's been awful lately.
Don't want to seem bitter but can't see van Gaal doing much with United. I think both Manc clubs want an Guardiola/Ancelotti/Simeone.
@Scrizzler Love you Scott but don't do this
@FutbolChief Wouldn't say anyone's "like Carrick." I'd say Carrick is a poor man's (for lack of a better phrase) Busquets.
@FutbolChief Carra is the only person close to him in punditry; kind of sad, really.
@FutbolChief Wouldn't say immaculate but he's a touch of class above every other former player who thinks they're a genius.
@LeeGibbo1 @IanDarke Yaya deserves some blame though. Doesn't look arsed to play any defense. Pulled an RVP last year, won't do anything now
@LeeGibbo1 @IanDarke There is no definite answer for us, to be honest. Too many lingering problems have boiled over. Overhaul coming.
@IanDarke City fans been wanting Yaya to be dropped for few months now, to be honest.
Wait what 
Manchester isn't blue, it's a city in the United Kingdom's second most populous urban area, which has a population of 2.55 million, in the s
@MCFC fuck off
@CowlonFullerton ding ding ding ding ding
@Dassed Even they're questionable tbh, this Prem season is a disaster
@CowlonFullerton @Calciodiction LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dare I say it, the standard of this Premier League in 14/15 is even more abysmal than Ferguson's last title in 12/13.
@FutbolChief I wasn't taking anything away from him; having a great season, really Moyes' fault in retrospect.
@HarryMellor_ Prem has been awful this year to be fair, not even Chelsea are worth noting
@FutbolChief point taken
@Calciodiction pls
@HarryMellor_ Please spend money @mansour @txiki
@Calciodiction This tweet
@FutbolChief Young, yeah, that one's unexplainable
@FutbolChief Fellaini didn't really have a career turnaround tbf; he was just played in the wrong position for a whole season
@Em_MCFC Deserved win but fuck me, that guy should stay out of Manchester for a few months.
Thought I'd be more mad to be honest.
#GarryMonkIN
Two of City's worst games in half a decade, back-to-back. Not sure what Pellegrini is supposed to tell the board.
Hold me @aguerosergiokun
All these offsides no-calls are karma for last year, aren't they
PSA: Pablo Zabaleta is indeed alive.
@BrxndonT as if we were going to outrun this United team with Silva, Milner and Yaya
@DonaldPoyah He's not THAT much better. Personnel a bigger problem but after this, Manuel deserves a slap on the wrist.
@BrxndonT pessimistic cunt, that's our job
SINCLAIR DIDNT DIE FOR THIS
@Phaetonv2 So this is why he's been so good this season
This is by all means a sackable offense in my book but even then, who do we replace Pellegrini with? #MCFC
Of course, Mangala plays him on.
Wow...
By slap on the wrist, I mean hit him with a truck.
Credit for the finishes but that's two offsides calls wrong. Lino deserves a slap on the wrist.
Not even sure if I want Europe any more. Just pull a Rodgers last year/van Gaal this year: run it in domestic comps.
It was an absolute pleasure to watch this squad in its peak... But on to the next.
Come on then.
@TheHenryFrancis Always the voice of reason, Mr. Francis <CLINKING BEER MUGS>
@AllyBongoJr We went wild to be honest; someone got a cut on their cheek, bahaha. All in good fun though, no one's been a cunt (yet).
@PranavArya Can't believe Manuel went with him and not Sagna, ridiculous with the season he's having
Steep mountain to climb. 
@Calciodiction all season*
We're literally being rattled by Ashley Young, FUCK SAKE ZABALETA STOP BEING SHIT
@Calciodiction Zaba is totally out of his mind though. Every time someone faces him up or takes him on, my heart drops.
@Calciodiction Should have contested it better. He and Demi could have communicated better, switched marks.
@AllyBongoJr You're telling me 
@AllyBongoJr Fair point and his main problem nowadays but I'm just glad he's on. I'd have driven home if he were sent off.
LRT: Let's do something about this, shall we.
@AllyBongoJr Lucky call but he's had a good game otherwise.
Premier League referee'ing failing still on the biggest stage. Offsides on Fellaini's goal and Vinny should be off.
Agüero being way too selfish. Navas, well... Yup, this is Jesus Navas.
We're losing to an inverted wingback and a fucking tree, for god's sake
@jossmcfc Poor covering from Zaba, poor marking from Demi/Gaël.
Clichy and Zaba having shit games. Mangala probably should have started too. Eh.
Never been more excited/nervous for a derby. Fuck, let's do it.

@Laporttila Okay, that just dawned upon me because we played the Sharks today
@NaturallyKatz FINALLY
@Laporttila Unrelated, fairly oblivious question: is Antti Niemi your favorite keeper
@Laporttila 
@NaturallyKatz If he goes one more inning, might have to off you
@BrxndonT Pretty sure the only qualifications are edited selfies and follow-for-follow
@patriciugh @adondonis  
@bjb0nd nope, not falling into a meme trap
@bjb0nd That's the point of Twitter tho
@jrhz24 How dare you compare me to a Spurs flop; if we're using London clubs, I'd say I'm at least an Arsenal-level flop
@jrhz24 Also confusing that my name is Calderon but point taken, I get that a lot
@jrhz24 To answer your implied question: yes
@jrhz24 It's a flag actually
Who allowed these yellow emojis to exist, since when did Pac-man have kids

@GoomihoLoL Actually missing irrelevant 30 for 30's and ESPN SC Features, this is terrible
@GoomihoLoL People who pay money to attend these should be banned from all sporting events and restaurants with more than 3 stars on Yelp
@GoomihoLoL They literally did a carousel of pick n' rolls then the ball carrier proceeded to do the chicken dance behind the Generals
WHO WOULD PAY ACTUAL MONEY TO SEE THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS
This is definitely considered "entertainment" by people who think Applebee's and Sizzler's are acceptable places for dinner.
No, but really, why are they still doing this-- the Globetrotters were never a thing, were they? They can't be.
ESPN showing Harlem Globetrotters and D-League basketball is their way of telling me to do something with my life.
@Dassed The way he pushes Smalling when he runs and then the fist pump &amp; jump: iconic.
We're considering this fashion nowadays? I take it back, I'm all of Kanye making Game of Thrones couture. 
The game itself was pretty cringeworthy too, I should say.
If they were English, they'd be playing the end of Hey Jude. If they were American, it'd be All I Do Is Win. Cringeworthy stuff here.
They literally played Back in Black, We Are the Champions, and YMCA. This is hilariously bad.
PSG winning the Coupe de la Ligue: might have been the most unenthusiastic &amp; cheesiest celebration for a trophy I've ever seen.
@Laporttila Favorite movie scene is still Matt Damon and John Malkovich playing one more game at the end of Rounders
@Laporttila All the dialogue in The Godfather and some scenes in The Warriors are classic too
@Laporttila Actual speeches: Any Given Sunday, Pursuit of Happiness
@Laporttila Why do you do this to yourself 
@jackmfootball @Em_MCFC This is the farthest I can go with the joke because I blocked antmcfc months ago
@Laporttila Did people ever take him seriously? I mean, the guy tweets lineups and stats, that's already suspect enough for me.
@Em_MCFC Hard hitting truths in the name of antmcfc
Happy birthday, @Em_MCFC. Second best City fan with a name that starts with an "Em."
My man, Kevin Gameiro.
@Laporttila Nothing's better than going to a show, party, or really any social gathering, and having dinner at midnight.
@Laporttila 10:30? Please, that's a normal dinner for us.
@Wilsonn4 Think it's called Midas Touch, there's another song with Rihanna too
@FutbolChief Duncan always keeping it real
Parma channeling their inner Burnley except people like Parma and actually care about its standing as a club. #notbitter
@Calciodiction I'd say Sunderland are worse. There are glimpses of good in Burnley's shitstorm of defending. Sunderland, watching paint dry.
@Calciodiction Arnautović looks fun at parties.
@Calciodiction I think Stoke deserve a pretty big shout, bar Geoff Cameron cause he has nice hair.
@Calciodiction Ugly as in?

@DmitriDaBuffalo He's the new Llorente, really
@DmitriDaBuffalo Shame Dost is shit in the game, poachers are even more useless in 15 than they were in previous games
@DmitriDaBuffalo How the fuck, ahaha-- Dybala, Braithwaite, Batshuayi on my FIFA Mt. Rushmore though
@chelpsea Not sure how to reply to basically being called emo

@jackmfootball James having season of his life though; best no. 10 in Europe right now. Poor Silva has Nasri, Milner, Navas to deal with.
@jackmfootball Depends on the squad; Silva admittedly needs players around him, James more of a solo driving force.
@PaulBelmes Bet you won't throw hands tho
@bjb0nd Haven't seen security there forever; FYI though, it's open 3-7:30 during break. Let me know, I'll be working at CSUN any way.

@ghostfacequillo That's the music industry, my friend. Soon enough, organic/indie music movements will be dead and gone.
@isayyyuh But fuck yeah, I got all the black one's with white soles-- walking on clouds
@isayyyuh Don't give into shoe hype; if you think it's good, it's good
@NoiseyMusic @ActionBronson @TheBelascoLA @goldenvoice I wanna see BamBam get down to Uptown Funk and scream I GOT A BRAND NEW CAHHHUAHAHH
@chelpsea ffs this was unwarranted
@chelpsea Stop, I haven't had a haircut
@chelpsea 
@chelpsea mfw I've been bantered off 
@chelpsea mfw someone says they don't like salmon 
@chelpsea Salmon teriyaki puts all teriyakis to shame but point taken
@chelpsea literally me 
@chelpsea Don't knock my tacos though, I'll fight you
@chelpsea Tell me something I don't know
@chelpsea It was also supposed to have cheese stuffed inside, it's quite good actually
@chelpsea BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT, FAM
@chelpsea as in like "Wow, you are totally hip and know how to cook"
Add me on Snapchat so you don't miss out on me being cool: ohwhatitsmeels 
@Calciodiction kiss ass
@ohhpe Honesty is a virtue tho
@JoshLawlessMCFC Allegri still deserves credit, but Garcia should win MOTS for Serie A unless Max wins the scudetto.
@JoshLawlessMCFC No one predicted it, tbf. Garcia deserves more credit for the comparable quality of players, of which Juve has slight edge.
@jackmfootball He's an upgrade from Pellé in every respect but having them as 1-2 strikers would suit them well.
@DmitriDaBuffalo Nah mate, you're confusing the #meaty Belgian forehead with the #meaty French forehead
@DmitriDaBuffalo Is this a joke or does someone somewhere have a picture of him in his youth wearing a Dreamcast kit
@DmitriDaBuffalo @Calciodiction Same, character and plot development is fun yet a bit interesting.
@DmitriDaBuffalo @Calciodiction Arrested Development?
Can see him earning a move to Spurs or Liverpool, maybe even Southampton. Proven striker in the Prem.
I hope he sustains this though. Great blend of physical gift and talent but seems like the type to be held back by injury.
My only concern with Benteke is how long it's taken him to get back up to speed in both form and fitness. No knock on his form though.
@Calciodiction I'm on Arrested Development right now. I'll probably start House afterwards.
@Calciodiction I've only watched one whole episode tbf. I'll get on that and GoT when they both finish. House of Cards sooner, probably.
When you considered putting Benteke in your fantasy then he scores a hat trick. 
@Calciodiction You and your damn campaigning. Fuck off, Frank Underwood.
@Calciodiction LOL. Trying to gain the approval of a low class blogger, high point for you, eh.
@Calciodiction Soft 3. Big Frankie Valli fan, me.
@Calciodiction @Dassed @CowlonFullerton Waiting for it to finish so I can binge the whole thing.
@Calciodiction @HarryMellor_ Confirmed: Joe is the bourgeoisie.
@HarryMellor_ @Calciodiction Yeah, no one in LA is dumb enough to drive one. Rich people here know how to spend their money.
@Calciodiction @Dassed @CowlonFullerton YOU TAKE THAT BACK
@HarryMellor_ @Calciodiction Ambitions of a rapper
@Calciodiction @Dassed @CowlonFullerton He hides behind his GIFs, HIDES I SAY.
@HarryMellor_ @Calciodiction Only people who get Range Rovers are the ones who can afford their shit electronic problems and hate parking.
@Dassed @Calciodiction @CowlonFullerton I agree with the man who has a hot dog on his head.
@HarryMellor_ @Calciodiction Definitely owns more peacoats than regular jackets/hoodies, modern day bourgeoisie.
@Calciodiction @CowlonFullerton HE'S NOT ONE OF US #JoeOut
@Calciodiction @CowlonFullerton Probably fly to Milan when your coat needs alteration, don't you
@Calciodiction @CowlonFullerton Eagletonian prick
@Calciodiction Taking over @CowlonFullerton's niche on Twitter. You're overstepping your boundaries.
@Calciodiction Confirmed: Joe is what our brethren across the channel would call, a "Tory."
LOL what the fuck, @ComplexMag @ComplexMusic, you play too much 
@FutbolChief @Em_MCFC We don't notice because City Twitter has been hosting its own clusterfuck this whole calendar year
@isayyyuh lmaooooooo for real tho, Immortal Technique is like Scarface if his music bored the shit out of me
@isayyyuh Same people who haven't heard an album before the 2000's that isn't Tupac's greatest hits or Biggie's two albums, RIP Biggie tho
@isayyyuh People who say Cudi revolutionizing rap are the same who think Forest Hills Drive and MBDTF are the best rap albums of 2010's
@BillRatchet  
@isayyyuh But dudes won't admit Cole's first two albums and everything Cudi did since Man on the Moon are, what my people call, BASURA
@Calciodiction @TikaTakaGuy @Em_MCFC @Wolf_Stack @CityAcrossPond 
@K_Debbz I was considering putting a pic of him but think Niko's face is disturbing enough
Kranjcar looks like he's getting ready to steal the Declaration of Independence 
@Laporttila This comment was meant to be ironic, yes? (Also, yes.)
@KennethMjvr Rich gaaang
@Dassed "do a sperm"
@7judd Only if you let it
@TikaTakaGuy smh being all doubtful about my glorious city
@TikaTakaGuy American sports fans &lt;
@TikaTakaGuy I understand, bae
@Calciodiction One of Ron's best moments imo
@TheBlandShaun Ha, I get it
@SilvaEsque @DareToSate3 Milner, don't care, can't take another hour or more of Navas
@YourMCFC Don't blame singular people, even the board have been terrible. Everything gone wrong.
@SilvaEsque @DareToSate3 He was REALLY shit today, unexplainable almost
@SilvaEsque Navas????????
@TikaTakaGuy @PandaGCMC He actually had a not-entirely-shit game; Ferna and Nasri our only good playees
@Calciodiction hahaha yes, Joe
City this calendar year so far: 6-7-2, only two clean sheets. "Title challengers." 
@TheHenryFrancis 59*
@MCFCFansCorner Everyone! We've been so focused and trying to right *who* is holding us back, everything has stalled.
@Em_MCFC Yes, but he's equally guilty. From players to managers to the board, awful awful awful.
@Em_MCFC Also Pellegrini.
We lost to Palace and they didn't even play da Australian GAWD Jedinák
Lampard... I don't even know what I'm saying any more.
Lanyard really just tried standing a ball up for David Silva. David. Silva.
Amazing cross...
Wait, why's Ferna come off
Bae coming on
Selfish.
@NaturallyKatz he was, actually
omg Sanogo is definitely one of those people who will have one good touch and score with it against us
Okay, the replay has finished, and I've now realized that holy fuck, what a fucking goal
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME HOPE
FUCK OFF TOURE
We're definitely the only team in the Prem that would finish 4th and yet still lose the playoff.
Ferna and Kompany been excellent today
What a tackle, fuck me
@FutbolChief Fernandinho ranting to Oliver right there, surprised someone in that XI has an actual soul
@joerds6 Sterling, Ward-Prowse, Stones all decent tho
Called him a "goat herder" ahahahahahahhahahah I can't do this
I think City losses are the best compared to any of the other top 6. When they lose, shit banter, but with us, top quality comedy going on.
@FutbolChief I am genuinely dumbfounded, I literally conceded the title months ago and never wavered
@FutbolChief People really think we still had a chance???????
@FutbolChief "TWO OH OH CLOCK" ffs Dunc
@FutbolChief ffs you've bottled the joke, should have just been 2-0 clock
This tweet implies that our title challenge was serious #jokesonyou 
@FutbolChief It's afternoon here, m8
Not sure which is worse, 12/13 or this season
Not sure what's with all the commotion, PSG already won yesterday
Poor Kompany; has his first good game in awhile now and everyone else has been shit.
@Laporttila *punches through piece of wood*
Definitely something wrong with us 
Wait, what did he just
MANGALA HAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHA
Won't be shocked if Pellegrini goes tonight.
@MiguelDelaney You giving handouts?
Not sure we deserve to finish in the top 4 and risk embarrassing the rest of the Prem by exiting in the group stages of the CL.
Puncheon loves playing against us, you know
Fuck sake, they're making Murray look like Le Tissier out there
Don't know what you're all on about, I'm a PSG fan
“@TikaTakaGuy: Hearing Agüero will score next” xoxo gossip girl
I'm frightened because I'm starting to believe Pellegrini may not make it through next season...
Always good to see Demichelis' ambition going forward but always afraid he'll get caught out like Vinny.
Joel Ward and Martin Kelly are about to look like Maldini 2.0 and 3.0, aren't they?
Should have scored.
@jrhz24 I'll give it a year
@Phaetonv2 But not breakfast food, what world do we live in
@Phaetonv2 you*
@Phaetonv2 I expected better from yiu
If we don't score 3 or 4 against Palace with this lineup, there's definitely something wrong with us.
"You'll help us get rid of that Pardew man, won't you?" 
@Laporttila We have a good record against Palace and Pardew. *knock on wood*
Powerhouse looks whack as hell but randomly got Kanye and Veggies
@PaulBelmes Sounds like an Arrested Development/Escape Plan hybrid
@Jehhaut @AvgSociaIMedia We here to make our presence felt tho
@desusnice Peter keeping YRN and 1017 Thug on loop while you wait at the gates of heaven

@Dassed Versace remix &gt; original with only Migos
@Dassed John more like Jowasntveryfunntthattimebuthesadecentguyaswell
@Dassed Like a fine wine; unless you hate wine, in that case, I guess I'm a bit of a dick
@Dassed The Mortal Kombat references in the hook too, shieeeeet
@Dassed The ad-libbing in Chinatown is unequalled
@Dassed Chinatown imo
@Dassed Gonna be in a home and there's a bunch of people of color, suddenly John is bumping YG and screams, "NIGGA I'M FROM B. P. T."
@Dassed I can see you now, sat in your room eating yams and bumping TPAB
@Dassed Home's gonna be all quiet then suddenly, "I GOT A BONE TO PICK"
@FutbolChief Virtual cheers, mate, seeing as it's illegal in my country and you're literally a few thousand miles away. <CLINKING BEER MUGS>
@isayyyuh @DailyRapFacts Forgot what track he did on LongLive but that album was trash; hope he goes back to LiveLove sounding shit
LRT: OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Happy birthday to one of the few United fans I don't wish a horrible life on, @FutbolChief. Top man, definitely worth a follow.
@snakespice Literally the best player in our squad right now. He *is* a baller, but how sad are we...

@bjb0nd BOBBY BITCH OH YEAH I'M BOBBY BITCH

No but really, what am I missing
I see JR Smith on my timeline
@DaggermouthTony People should start investing all that time and effort into themselves and not rich people who don't care about them.
@DaggermouthTony Nah, everybody speakin' nonsense tho. So focused on flexing their fashion and flexing on behalf of dumb celebrities.
@DaggermouthTony Very few people even like talking nowadays. Peeps can't take time to have a nice conversation, I swear.
@SilvaEsque Noon over here, so 8PM/20:00 for you?

@Phaetonv2 It's *really* good, I'll leave it at that.
@Phaetonv2 Imagine watching Barça when LE CLASSIQUE is on
Shout to Alphonse Aréola too. Putting on for mixed Filipinos who pick their countries that aren't shit. Same with Alaba.
As shit as he is now, Florian Thauvin is still bae ever since I saw him with France when they won the youth World Cup.
@TikaTakaGuy Oh please, don't ever compare me to that biased prick-- he's the Italian Ray Hudson except people like Ray Hudson
Cavani off before the hour. A shadow of his former self, really.
@jackmfootball Literally *this* <OK HAND SIGN> close
@Dassed blocked
A tale of two halves. Real classic, Le Classique right now.
@Dassed Great men think alike, eh
Wow, this game is unreal right now
@isayyyuh ahhhhhhh, keepin it real
@isayyyuh Is it Chobani tho
@TikaTakaGuy It's full of tourist attractions and people who probably still use Facebook
@TikaTakaGuy Oh my god, please don't use that as a basis for judging us, it's literally anti-Los Angeles
@TikaTakaGuy What Snapchat story
Or a car in general
That would suffice
Really need a car with AUX capabilities
And no trap DJs on the weekends
Slowly realizing 92.3 is just Power 106 with more throwbacks and no Uptown Funk

Gonna forgot football is a thing until Monday, depending on our result, might have to forget until next season
@City_Watch WHO THE FUCK ARE THESE PEOPL
@PandaGCMC Implying we're not going to play him after January
I just used the word "esoteric" in an actual tweet, think I've actually won Twitter
@Laporttila American sports twitter shouldn't exist at all, it makes football twitter look like a esoteric Socratic dialogue
@Phaetonv2 Is that still a thing, might have to off myself if it really is
@Phaetonv2 Gain the approval of an overrated prepubescent rapper in a man's(?) body
@TikaTakaGuy You wanna scrap
If you use social media and you don't have a job but don't use it for A) bad jokes or B) cute pics of dogs, I don't know why you're here.

7:30 was a personal highlight at the @trvisXX x @youngthug show just to see Thugger in a poncho

Going over blog names with Patricia 
@ghostfacequillo what a hypocrite
@snakespice @Dassed
Joe and I have been talking about starting our own blog for a week now and we haven't thought of a name. These are first world problems.
@snakespice For me, Fast &amp; Furious is the Kevin Hart of action movies; loud, flashy, no content-- just how Americans like it
@snakespice Liked the first two movies, got tired of it
@snakespice What are you talking about, America is obsessed with it
@ItsKingCantona hahahahahahah the shade, so much bitterness
@ItsKingCantona I'm a typical millennial American, bruh/fam
@ItsKingCantona Actually, I've used it in my local pub. Other than that, never to friends or anything.
@ItsKingCantona life*
@ItsKingCantona I only use it with Brit/footie friends. Never verbally uttered it in my like, ahaha.
@ItsKingCantona Ah, wasn't sure if you lived across the channel. I can drop the "mate" then. #MURICA
@isayyyuh Made tacos for dinner, come thru
@ItsKingCantona Just out of curiosity, where do you live, mate
@ItsKingCantona It is cookie dough, tbf

@Calciodiction When Joe uses emojis to capture his reactions to my tweets
@Calciodiction jk love you
@Calciodiction who cares
@snakespice That's unfortunate LOL
@Calciodiction FIFA transfer system got even more shit this year tbh. So easy to manipulate youth and free transfers.
@Calciodiction Got him on a free on a Leipzig career, ahah. Same with Ronaldo and Cuadrado when he was still the GOAT RM.
@Calciodiction @snakespice #ThingsBougiePeopleSay
@snakespice Arleta, little bit east of the 405-- shit area tbh

Bit late for April Fool's, isn't it? 
@ohhpe lmaoooo y'all get detention for this? School actin' way too childish. <SLEEPING FACE>
@joerds6 It's almost a yearly tradition, tbh
@joerds6 Been that way for about a century now, lmao
@Laporttila Damn, that's unfortunate. Everything probably coming out of the UK, huh?
@Laporttila Not sure how the shoe market operates in Europe though.
@Laporttila They're a bit pricey though; mostly because of the Flyknit tech and most of the color ways were limited release.
@Laporttila 1st = Racers, 2nd = Tubulars. 
@Laporttila Flyknit Racers, Tubulars

@bjb0nd He's definitely got the anger of a Scot though. Not saying much, they're all cynical, bitter bastards across the channel.
@bjb0nd Joke's on you, he was raised in North London and Southwark.
@bjb0nd Glad to see he's passionate about his hate for being a shepherd though, manual labor is not lost.
@bjb0nd Afraid to even mention the Old Firm in fear of being curb stomped; he may drink his coffee with his pinky out, but he'd do it
I feel so enlightened.
"Sheep are stupid and if you pick them up, they shit all over you." - actual quote from my Scottish professor
@FutbolChief Oh, so now it's about you, offffffffffffff course.
@JamesTylerESPN Wouldn't dare take a bad step against the Hamburg Jordi Alba.
@JamesTylerESPN Ah, yes. The totally-not-ironic-but-classic forward to fullback conversion and vice versa. Truly a beautiful game.
@JamesTylerESPN Outside of Mahrez, not a very memorable team. Drinkwater, on virtue of name. Nugent on virtue of being David Nugent.
@JamesTylerESPN Don't want to seem harsh, but Leicester's center halves are pretty shit.
@JamesTylerESPN Brad Jones deserves a shout here. The goal he conceded to Rooney at Old Trafford was the greatest thing ever.
@JamesTylerESPN Wes Morgan; haven't seen him have a good game for Leicester all season. His strength is to CB's what pace is to forwards.
@JamesTylerESPN I'd argue that's more QPR's fault for signing Rio.
@FutbolChief @thphnts LOL imagined Dunc putting down his shades (def wears them indoors) and flexing in anger at this comment

@Wilsonn4 MVP is regular season only for some reason. Never quite understood why.
@Wilsonn4 Harden; Rockets would be nowhere near where they are w/o him. Westbrook got in late, still has a chance.
@Wilsonn4 Ah, I see-- it's really only between Harden, Westbrook, and Curry
@Wilsonn4 <RAISED HAND>
I should study more often, hahaha.
I then proceeded to walk out early to get breakfast from Burger King and am now celebrating with French toast sticks and an OJ carton.
For the first time in my life, I studied for a test, a midterm on astronomy, which I know nothing about, and got an A. Incredible.

I already went to the first Travis/Thug show and I'm literally cathartically reliving it with Kanye via @robesman' timeline
@robesman Kanye is present at Club Nokia and Birdman is closing the show, this is glorious
@robesman HE DID IT AGAIN FFDSGSGSG
@shanethacreator @robesman You're telling me, we *only* got Birdman the 1st show, smh so hard
@robesman HE STILL THERE LMAOOOOOOOOO
@robesman wtf we got Birdman 1st show, this some bullshit
@Dassed Not sure what this means
Power 106 just played King Kunta #WELCOMETO2015
I survived the rodeo @trvisXX @youngthug

@isayyyuh Ah shit, finna avoid Olmpic and Crenshaw hahaha
Dudes going too #HAM
@isayyyuh Travis or nah?
@ohhpe A single song I can think of when I hear creative, "Wonderbread" by Danny Brown.
@ohhpe Any song off Blue Chips 2, Bronson's sampling is ridiculously funny but he paints nicely over it.
@ohhpe Creative, how so?
@Calciodiction Imagine a Young Thug cover of Children's Story.
Juan Agudelo &amp; Charlie Davies as your two starting forwards: this is what dreams are made of.

@Dassed felt a little passive-aggressive that one
@Calciodiction Young Thug = greatest storyteller rap has been graced with since Scarface
Lowkey subtweet @Calciodiction
Travis Scott &amp; Young Thug tonight. 
@CowlonFullerton #AuriemmaOut
@CowlonFullerton His real name is Luigi and he doesn't go by it? The fucking snake, he's deprived us all.
@Dassed agkaxnkslabshaiskavwiahskjsshsksjwblxoehwhwyiroepajavzvbzndmshwowphfnrykfjwhwosncnskajsu
@Dassed life is great #GettingOverZayn
@Dassed literally imagining you getting down to Headband with a fucking hot dog on your head
Cheesecake for breakfast. This is when I realized the American Dream was real.
@chelpsea Was this begging for an @ or
@chelpsea @Dassed @Scrizzler Saving this, thanks
@HarryMellor_ @PandaGCMC Pretty much
@PandaGCMC Group of Islamic fundamentalists; gained recent fame/infamy because they've killed upwards of 5000 civilians. Crazy stuff.
@NaturallyKatz dat back line combo breaker
“@PzFeed: BREAKING NEWS: Boko Haram uses chainsaws to behead 23 people in northeast Nigeria” *watches people google Boko Haram*
@isayyyuh THE FUCK IS THIS HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
@isayyyuh Future bio
Great, great article from @PabloTorre on Jeremy Lin's untold narrative: 
Hungry Fox got me fucked up
@TikaTakaGuy @ManCityPhotos @FalseYas @Em_MCFC @Calciodiction snake
@TikaTakaGuy Isn't Acid Rap like spring/summer 2013
@bjb0nd want my wrists so cold pneumonia in my fist
@patriciugh blocked
On the bright side, just balled out at Cheesecake Factory and got two slices of cheesecake
Wish I had a pair of Air Max's so I could post a pic for Air Max Day, but I ain't got no style or shoe game
@DmitriDaBuffalo @TikaTakaGuy That's what I use for a towel
@Scrizzler Yeah, couple times. Haven't been for a game in a few years now tho.
@TikaTakaGuy 
@chelpsea @Scrizzler ffs fuck your Knicks
@Scrizzler Yeah, family are Laker fans
@Scrizzler Yeah, takes awhile to appreciate the fun and pretty aspects of LA; taken me 19 years
@Scrizzler Nice part about LA is you can get everything; loud/quiet, hip/old school, suburban/metro. Whatever you want, really.
@chelpsea So much beef on my TL, shocking allegations @Scrizzler
@DmitriDaBuffalo @Scrizzler So it's basically a two-party election?
@chelpsea I only know this much; gonna use Scott as a shield tbh
@CowlonFullerton Sometimes, people are just angry
Sometimes, people just want to make it on World Star
@DmitriDaBuffalo @Scrizzler You've got like 5 major parties, confuses the shit out of me. But better than just 2, I guess?
Don't know a damn thing about politics, don't know where this is going.
Just been called a Republican by a man I've never met who lives across the channel. Not sure how to feel.
@DmitriDaBuffalo @Scrizzler Not a big fan of the two-party system
@Scrizzler It's literally just suburbs and occasional shopping malls/lots-- wide lanes though, driving here &gt; driving in LA
@Scrizzler Don't know a thing about politics but enjoy not being called a conservative or a Tory
@Scrizzler It's nice b/c I get to enjoy all the perks of LA w/o dealing w/ annoying aspects of actually living there like traffic &amp; parking
@Scrizzler I live in SF Valley, which is like half an hour away from actual LA (i.e. downtown, et al.)
@Scrizzler We all make mistakes, Scott
@TikaTakaGuy You're telling me 
@TikaTakaGuy ayyyyyyyyyyyyy, welcome to the #NERDS
“@KylieJenner: Not releasing a song” Your turn @IggyAzalea @Tip
@Scrizzler I had a headache earlier
We are one
Twitter is currently, what they say, "LIT"
If Zayn was a real one, he'd get a life sentence then release fire mixtapes from prison a la Gucci
Zayn Malik left 1D so he could ghost write for Kylie Jenner and drop an album with T.I. and Iggy #staywoke

@Dassed Thought I was gonna use it for something but think I deleted it already.
@Dassed Only the novelty food hat pics.
"And my tiny nipples went to France"
@Catf1sh dropping knowledge on today's music industry 
Shout out to the cooks at Buffalo Wild Wings; the servers can fuck off though <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>

Here's a recap of the night: 
@WarAndSetPiece Do people still like him????
@CowlonFullerton *hits blunt*
@BasedLipps Yeah, haven't DL'd it yet
Haven't heard Freddie Gibbs, Earl, or Bronson. My studying/homework sessions finna be live AF.
@Calciodiction shietttttt fuck homework then
@Calciodiction Waiting for Mr. Wonderful to drop, haven't heard new Earl yet.
@Calciodiction @CityAcrossPond ffs you did this on purpose
@Calciodiction "tied-for-first" wha
@DmitriDaBuffalo @TikaTakaGuy Hell is this
Great game, that
Who does Suárez think he is, Neymar?
Fuck off Gary, I did it first 
Bravo, Bravo <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Neymar has been, what my native people would call, "basura"
What a man, fucking hell
@TheHenryFrancis True, he didn't have Verratti in this kind of form. Underappreciated that kid is. Would take him in a heartbeat.
@TheHenryFrancis It's debatable; think Blanc has done better, benefit of the doubt given he has more competition in league than Carlo did.
@TikaTakaGuy beef @Calciodiction 
He's talking shit about your boy
@TheHenryFrancis Nah, just taking the piss. Do think PSG are better under Blanc though.
Imagine not loving Candreva. 
@TheHenryFrancis They didn't have a decent one until Blanc <GRIMACING FACE>
@TheHenryFrancis @begiristain hasn't tweeted since 2011, the caveman. No wonder we're so far behind.
@Calciodiction @TransfersCalcio anwuakkdbwoaheiwwisnuwbdosbsojqhshwkwwjdwiwgspqjwoqkw das bae
@TheHenryFrancis @txiki's blocked me too, our board cares nothing for the fans
@TheHenryFrancis Fraud of a manager, he is 
Holy shit, what a fucking goal that should have been
Big fan of Scott tweeting in Spanish then just using the upside down exclamation point
Random memes and jokes being thrown about on my timeline and @FutbolChief is captioning old United photos. Can't knock the dedication.
@NaturallyKatz Top 5 striker in the world
Benzema again, maybe one day he'll get to levels similar to Giroud
@Calciodiction 
Holy hell, what a finish
Ronaldo about to get the hottest spray tan of 2015 after this game
@Calciodiction Second only behind Antonio Nocerino.
loooooooool Neymar
@Calciodiction Greatest keeper Arsenal's ever had. Comparable to the Yashin's and Schemichel's of the world. Kasper, of course.
@Calciodiction By the way, this is Emiliano, not Emilio. 
Did Phil really just compare Casillas to Manuel Neuer, even today's Neuer v. Gladbach &gt; Iker
@Calciodiction I'm like the unpopular vonstrenginho. Also, I'm a massive prick.
@Calciodiction EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE SET
@Calciodiction Tancredi &gt; every meme ever
@Calciodiction YOU CANNOT ALWAYS PAPER OVER THE CRACKS, AND THERE ARE STILL CRACKS THERE
Friendly reminder that Ramos was in the TOTY because he's good at everything but defending (consistently)
Not sure if Ramos or Kompany
Beautiful cross from the best player to ever live/set foot on Earth/breath/exist
Beautiful header that, tbf
Benzema, almost Giroud-esque
@NaturallyKatz Not convinced he'd do a job with our squad/improving our squad, but that's just me
@NaturallyKatz You want Carlo?
match* ffs
Definitely a red card in this maych
Fun suicide method: take a shot for every obscure metaphor Ray Hudson spews
@CowlonFullerton Watch El Clasíco so you can laugh at other people's anxiety before suffering from it yourself
@snakespice Gómez, Suarez, Deulofeu-- only U-21, fuck hahaha

@Scrizzler ffs
@RapDescendant Should be eating it insyead
@RapDescendant Mate, I'm studying Middle English right now, let alone trying to get a grasp of the language itself.
@RapDescendant Imagine thinking we used the word "nonce" in the US
@RapDescendant get it, it's a double entendre because I'm an English major and you're a nonce
@RapDescendant ffs I should be doing the reporting here
@RapDescendant bit of a harsh reply, isn't this
@RapDescendant when you miss the joke
Runnin thru 6 with my mous(e slippers) 
Most interesting thing just happened: walked by a Steve Madden and they were playing Bandz a Make Her Dance #welcometo2015
@snakespice feel like you can appreciate this 
My mom's car really needs a functioning aux cable

@City_Watch die
@Calciodiction @AllyBongoJr This tweet is peak Joe.
@AllyBongoJr LMAO beef @Calciodiction
@Calciodiction unique than others. Metro Boomin deserves credit for that too, but yeah.
@Calciodiction Don't know if I'd say his sound is commercial. He definitely tries to make bangers but I'd say his production is bit more
@Calciodiction Mainstream? Hasn't released an album yet, lmao. But point taken; his sound takes time to grow on you.
@Calciodiction Yeah, why
@Dassed selfie to cement our friendship
@Dassed ffs mate, pics
@Dassed If Chelsea lose one of their next 3 then I'll have hope
Just realized I've transferred Silva out but kept Özil in, think I'm just gonna stop
@FutbolChief In top form, he finishes as well as anyone. Movement and ball control good. Only in top form though, which he is now.
@FutbolChief Always secretly rated Giroud, just not an immediate go-to striker for me.
Imagine a front four of Benzema, Giroud, Ribèry, Griezmann
Giroud and Kane on two goals each while my captain Agüero is sat on his own hands
Sánchez really bright early on
Brilliant from Sánchez who's been shit but of course Welbz fucks it up
Welbeck lmaoooooooooooooo
@FutbolChief Baffled by the amount of English people who don't want to see him succeed; exactly what's wrong with the football culture.
@NBCSports @NBCSportsSoccer PSA: Extra Time isn't working
@DmitriDaBuffalo Welp, lol
@DmitriDaBuffalo Ah, 18 it is then-- point still stands, unbelievable Kane is even on this level
@DmitriDaBuffalo Thought they were both still on 17
Silva scores but Agüero doesn't; tbf Myhill had a great game but he's ruining my fantasy team
That goal brings Harry Kane level with Costa and Agüero on 17, unbelievable
Agüero hat trick, pls ty xoxo
@K_Debbz state of English refereeing right now, bahaha
@K_Debbz According to English referees, color doesn't matter, they're concerned if you're English or not #colorequality #ethnocentric
Love Bony but we paid how many million for the #fraud and he didn't #breakdance
@K_Debbz #NumbersNeverLie
@Dassed Was gonna say otherwise but everyone in the pub having a good time, figured it was better not to argue
@TikaTakaGuy screenshotted
@SilvaEsque @TikaTakaGuy We've scored from a corner, lol go back to sleep
@TikaTakaGuy Imagine not waking up at 5am to drive to the pub
Feel stressed because I feel obligated to during City games, strange feeling this
@Scrizzler It's nighttime, mate
@Dassed This what you do on your off days
@Dassed Good meme
@TheBlandShaun Tottenham?
@TheBlandShaun My favorite RH quote: "[Ramos] heads the ball beautifully, he rises up like a salmon in a stream"
@TheBlandShaun I got almost the entire crew to follow me then they unfollowed after a day, ffs
@Dassed Season got me into football in the first place; speaks for itself
@TheBlandShaun Used to think he as annoying when I watched La Liga, Ligue 1, Bundesliga; man is a legend-- a loud, still annoying legend
@TheBlandShaun Rap game Ray Hudson
His pass-to-assist to Milner for Balotelli's 2nd too, what a game, what a man
David Silva's volleyed through ball to Džeko for the 6th against United gives me goosebumps to this day
@TheBlandShaun It was Fletcher (good goal too tbf)
@TheBlandShaun The commentary makes me so happy: IT IS, IT IS SIX, SIX OF THE BEST FOR MANCHESTER CITY. UNITED, NOT JUST BEATEN, HUMILIATED.
@TheBlandShaun Peak Ed that game: "WHOAAA, EDIN DZEKOOO"
