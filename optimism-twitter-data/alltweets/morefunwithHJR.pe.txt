@m2c0b @BLT_4 @TheDirtySports @Things4WhitePpl so they can show him be a dick and mash in a girls face
Sleep at night 11 to 630.. Class 7 to 8... Sleep again 930 1230...  Nightmares and the best dream ever in such a short time

@boomclark20 @LibbyBarton i love your guys' ways of expressi g how you secretly miss the shit out of hayden
@boomclark20 find da tik
The only positive thing from all of this is the entire nation just witnessed that disgrace. Only happened because its "America's team"
Randy is willing to party. Gather your friends. Park in the middle school
@BLT_4 most iconic moment in the class of 2013
@PaulCostanzo I guess I take that back...
@PaulCostanzo wouldnt mind it at all.  Outside of Uofm I like to see the Ducks win anyway
@PaulCostanzo Baylor is definetly making the Big 12's case for that final playoff spot.  Tcu didnt hurt either
If only the ideas that rolled through my head at this point in my sleeplessness came true.
@BLT_4 except new windsor's eve
@BLT_4 I can see lottery tickets but see already knew they had no value lmao.
@BLT_4 might be the worst thing I have ever heard.  Lmao
- Winner of DET-GB wins NFC North
- Winner of CAR-ATL wins NFC South 
@PaulCostanzo sounds like Evans one dimensional
@m2c0b then u surprisingly stabbed me with the stuff, and I went shopping and got like pop and pie.   And one of the randoms was Od'ing
@m2c0b just had a dream where you, and others, were injecting yourself with high powered pain meds on a grocery store floor. lol
@m2c0b @BLT_4 he loves all company
Warms my heart to see Jay Slutler and the Bears look like the worst team ive seen since the 0-16 Lions.   Go Leos! Times are changin
@Gabby__Nocifora @BLT_4 shes like an aunt to me. She loves me the most
@BLT_4 maybe.   But I mean it still shows hes got a boot
@BLT_4 just was watching some postgame stuff.   Blair walsh made a 70 yarder in warm ups.   So I suppose it wasnt that rediculous
Guess what day it is!?....Lions game day!...Forward down the field, a charging team that will not yield, and when the blue and silver wave..
@CarrieGreenman. Feel reluctant to go to bed at night.... also feel reluctant to get out of bed in the morning.   Irony.   Better?
@CarrieGreenman time of day.  Sleep and bed feel incredible in the morning.   Rarely feel like goin to bed at night

#DefendTheDen

I think thanksgiving is the best holiday...  basically an all you can eat buffet and your guarenteed a lions game. Thats my legacy
@AlexGoodwin1 @TPBoysClips weird already saw this.
The pats are toying with the lions right now.   Good teams score with 1st downs inside the 5.  Unreal
@skwogler im becoming a theo riddick fan anyway
This lions game has some real turning point value... Lets go!
@Lions personally like theo out there more
@CalebFrein17 of all things to upset me in the world, that was dead last   it was a courtesy invite

Lions withdrawls.  Bye week is devastating
@nm12matthews @hannahpackan it makes me laugh what we consider a good night. Lol should have been an issue.  Was a blast
@AlexGoodwin1 @_becca_browning @boomclark20 ELE

No matter the outcome of the Tigers game today or David Price's performance. He is my Tiger, mechanical genius.   Love it
Sadface   theres gotta be a sub par kicker out there that is at least 60% success   this is unreal.
@BLT_4 hopefully price can go 27 strong over the n3xt 3
@BLT_4 ewe. Just so yuck. Call up kenny rogers

@threeamigos379  dude is no joke.    Could be better than sherman.  At least in my opinion
Lol.  Live 
@Josh13Barnes they recieve top 25 in the country talent/athletes and put out mediocre big ten performances
@Josh13Barnes they have the weakest team ive ever seen. Fuckin pillow fight and gardner cant hit a man in stride.  Ever

Ill be surprised if richmond doesn't win.   Christian finished last in our tournament earlier this year.. With that said they've been there
@PaulCostanzo it is what it is.   Its a little bit worse because i know exactly what I'm missing out on.
We handled a team and won by 4 runs to a team that is playing in the division 1 semi finals.  #ThisBites
@tyler_lozen23 now thats a serious classic 
@hannahpackan you are on a tweeting rampage.  Dangg
@DcFlowtron16 @PaulCostanzo the pistons things lasted like a year.  They were good then!
@PaulCostanzo haha i suppose.   Too bad i didnt care at all about basketball.
@PaulCostanzo c'mon now. I was 11.  I dont even play basketball haha

Toad.

@DcFlowtron16 great game out there bud.   You were making some seriously sick plays at short. #MuchRespect

@Kmazz1008 @megwes1 @eschweihofer10 i should be good then. Just need to call for an appointment

Adrian Beltre freaks when people touch his head.   So funny   Haha
@PaulCostanzo @bradrobb @coachmattd jake only batted 564 that year

@CoachMattD @paulcostanzo doin my best to keep it in sc.
@dvanbus when i turned it on i thought it was current. But the rankings weren't the same
@dvanbus yea it was but i never saw that before.  Interesting.
Anyone else see the indiana/purdue scuffle on btn?
@Josh13Barnes @mick_itnasty sounds like u have problems with too many people
@Josh13Barnes @mick_itnasty sorry barnes.  Didnt know i annoyed you that bad
“@BSheShe5: @Mick_ItNasty my cousin played on jv for northern!! Plus I figured you were having a blast with Lawrence...”  Lol. Lawrence
Cant really blame howard for this game... Completely over-matched
@Josh13Barnes ill have my mom hem my new ones tonight.  Spread the word
@Josh13Barnes wanna organize team stir-ups tomorrow?
@CoachMattD @josh13barnes keep producing them coach.  Makes a big difference!
@Mick_ItNasty goes quicker than you think.   Year flew by
@Mick_ItNasty yea but i have to go through like 3 ceremonies and bullshit.  But baseball and no school sounds fun
@Mick_ItNasty waste of time. I agree. But i only have like 8 days of school left lol
@Mick_ItNasty not even hard. Havent been to 3rd or 4th hr in over a week
We have to win wed.  Cant break the streak of league titles.
@JDisSCB no way someone said that
On right now by Ace Hood. Well its simply top notch
@BenMiller55 not too woried. We had to wait like 5 hours to play our second game. And it was 40 with 40mph winds
@BenMiller55 7 1 i think.  We only alllowed 3 hits.
@BenMiller55 no.  We swung our purses really well tho
@Mick_ItNasty lawrence
@Mick_ItNasty we would be a 100x better with our summer coach
@Mick_ItNasty lol.  Bill got mad at nolan for being pumped about his play. Annoying.
@Mick_ItNasty we had a bunt for hit and a texas leaguer
@Mick_ItNasty you know whats more embarrassing?   That entire game.  They were horrible we just played about as good as 5th graders
Im really amped for this tournament tomorrow. Gull lake/ Grand Rapids Christian/ St johns.   Lets win
So greasy. #barnes 
@eschweihofer10 where did u get a parking ticket at?
I rest my case..
Ii dont know much about hockey but this rookie line has looked pretty good on the offensive end to me
@camchach8 crowd quiets..  But meanwhile howard has been a savior
@camchach8 could look at it like there momentum was stopped by the long break...
@hannahpackan okay..  Well its been way too long!
@hannahpackan not even a simple hello<THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
@BLT_4 i would be if he was a tiger
How rude
@BLT_4 cant argue... But he is really really good. Haha

@Josh13Barnes @paulcostanzo @DcFlowtron16 i wish we had an under the lights game vs mv.
@Josh13Barnes thats the spirit
@Josh13Barnes no offence but u should go as our 5 hitter.  Worked out pretty well today haha
@Josh13Barnes we could also use our 4 hitter
@DetroitRedWings @easports #NHL14Datsyuk
We played like t ballers today.  Ball had to be down the middle for a strike and we still cant hit..  Threw it around like donkeys.   #smh
@niwdahttocs @eschweihofer10 worth a shot
@eschweihofer10 @niwdahttocs red and blue Hawaiian shirts?
That 7th inning for me was bad. I grounded out, was hit by a pitch.  Blown perfect game,  blown no hitter,  possibly first earned run #shit
@JTobey03 how were those home runs tobey?   #ohwait.   Strike and wtp
@PaulCostanzo if we resort to that u will be the first to know. Haha
@PaulCostanzo our team was discussing 100s of industrial sized sponges.  I dont even know if i will get to pitch at home. Its crazy
@PaulCostanzo yea. Our outfield is a pond.  We may be playing at warren mott tomorrow and wed
@DcFlowtron16 they fucking ppd us again
@BLT_4 those pick up line things crack me up. Lmao
@TheDovakhiin24 that is gunna feel like hell

@BLT_4 that would have been an awesome conversation to record
@Josh13Barnes @jobbynation @jtobey03 and that hit was in question
@Jobbynation @josh13barnes good news is we managed to win with no hits.. Imagine if we hit the ball!?
You know your an idiot when... You have Barnes and I agreeing
Fuck everyone we have a baseball game in 16 hours    Focus.  #BATTLECREEKBOUND
@maxxximiilian the dumb hot girls can get in?  Idk.  Maybe a +1
@BigPJ1414 excellent point retweeted sir.. Excellent point it was
@maxxximiilian academics, baseball, basketball, football, swimming.. Lol hockey...
@Mick_ItNasty @josh13barnes i wouldnt have said shit.  I woulda been pumped but wouldnt have downed state
@Josh13Barnes @mick_itnasty cause state fans cant accept that we took over the only sport they ever had on us
@Josh13Barnes @mick_itnasty why is this argument even happening...  It was michigan vs louisville.
@ScottyC7 i dont get them.  I would have been so pumped if msu won..   Except against michigan
@BryRobbins i hate you if u rooted against michigan today.  If not.. Ur nott a shitter. Lol
@Mick_ItNasty @josh13barnes mickey u make no sense.  Hes been proving points.. Ive been insulting ur opinions
@Mick_ItNasty @josh13barnes and thats why people think your an idiot..
I cant tolerate people.. Michigan was the youngest team in the tourney and made it there.   Unbelievable game.  Great season.. Go blue
@Mick_ItNasty @josh13barnes all i can think about is seth curry..
@Josh13Barnes @mick_itnasty well stated
@BryRobbins coming from a former michigan fan?
@bschweig11 he played the whole second half basically. Lol.
@eschweihofer10 me neither. Specifically mickey and drew.   And a vast majority
Mr diller is gunna give us so much hw... Michigan loss and its tuesday.  #fack
I hate msu fans.  I root for michigan state whenever they dont play michigan.  Its inner state pride.
No matter what fan you are... Cant argue that this isnt an awesome game
@Click_Clak_ i hate u
A lead with basically no trey burke involvement at the half,  ya ill take it
@maxxximiilian well stated
SPIKE DONT PLAY WITH GIRLS!
This camera dude blows

@DcFlowtron16 a free jacket would be cool.  And i could use headphones tho. That is appealing
@Mick_ItNasty @dcflowtron16 i have raffle tickets to sell for summer. I can only sell so much.  Im content with what we have. Screw it
@maxsabbagh sorry sticking my feet out the window is so crazy

@BigPJ1414 crazy fucker victor too
@BigPJ1414 THe top 5 teams in the big ten could beat eAch other on any given night.  Simple as that. I need sleep
@BigPJ1414 im not agreeing or disagreeing at this point.  Still half a season left.  And indiana has been at home in big games
I hate state fans.  Not them personally.   But their opinions
@BigPJ1414 @gunnarglodich they are good too. But they beat michigan with the 3 ball.
@gunnarglodich im not the biggest fan of there ability to score with a good offense.  Their fast break might be the best in the country tho
@gunnarglodich they have died 2 times.  Lived 20
@DcFlowtron16 state fans all suck cock.  Most michigan fans root for state when they play other teams.  At least that ik.
@Mick_ItNasty im surprised it wasnt called.  Just looked like at the end it was mostly ball and thats prolly all te refs saw. Idk.
@Mick_ItNasty he got quite a bit of ball.
@BigPJ1414 oh i thought u missed it.  #jokes
@BigPJ1414 get it
TREY FOR TREY!

@Mick_ItNasty damn.
@Mick_ItNasty did devin fight the kid that he said he was going too?
@PaulCostanzo yup. There was quite a bit of MISCA qualifying done. Im not sure of all of them but ik garrett was easily fast enough.
@PaulCostanzo st clair won 376 and Marysville was second with 310.  Im unsure about ph and mc.
@tyler_lozen23 did he crash in best trick or the freestyle runs
@hallway69 the next krispy kreme
@ScottyC7 #andmoneyeventually
@ScottyC7 yea true.  Idk. He really cant go wrong.  Lucky dude
@ScottyC7 yea i think so too.  But idk. Put yourself in his situation.  Free degree from uofm.  2 more years on a great team/ NBA idk lol
@ScottyC7 i wonder if they dont make it to the final four if he will consider it
It sucks. Im not good enough at anything to get into michigan. #lifelongfan
@PaulCostanzo @bseddon always has been    You could talk a lot if you can dominate individually. No1 does though
@PaulCostanzo very true.  It also could be that half the battle is yourself racing the clock.
@PaulCostanzo swimming is weird.  It is always friendly after a meet. No bitterness to rivalries.. Different than anything else
@PaulCostanzo swim version of the pink halo project 
@BrandonBoyte school is overrated
@BrandonBoyte maybe not friday tho.  Temps going down to a high of 26 thursday so all this flooding could get all frozen
@DcFlowtron16 idk why everyones hatin. The wings will be 3 and 3.  Lost to a solid chicago team in ot.  One bad game to start the year?
@tyler_lozen23 @dcflowtron16 at least ur done with exams. Ive been riding that no study thing for 6 dayys
Ik no1 finds much interest in swim. But we are undefeated at dual meets and beat marysville  107 to 79 tonight #ultimategrind
@tyler_lozen23 lol. My mom said the same thing to me about physics..  More like its dropped a letter grade each day off
@ksquared00 lol afraid to live on the edge?  And our meet is still on as far as i know.  Ill let you know if something changes
@ksquared00 take a cruise in the fog.  That'll get your heart pumpin a bit. Crazy
@Mick_ItNasty ok. Well outside wouldnt keep them frozen either.   Only freezers would do.   Limited search area
@Mick_ItNasty sum pump rooms are cold.    And i was thinkin the popsicles in the bags that are frozen water basically.
@Mick_ItNasty check your sum pump room.  Thats where mine was?
@Mick_ItNasty my mom hid my mtn dew    I found it.  I drank it. #BadAss

@DcFlowtron16 @click_clak_ #strangefear that josh has a child one day
@tyler_lozen23 i dont root against him either. I root for competetion and the youngster is bringing it.  Makes it more exciting
@tyler_lozen23 if i were white i wouldnt be afraid now, but that kid might take him down in the next few years.  Imagine once the kid grows
That 14 year old on x games was literally so good.  Future winner.   Just think if you were out there. Damn

@Mick_ItNasty unreal is a perfect word. Its not even pop.  Its chemicals

@Mick_ItNasty diet anything tastes like hell.  I like you mickey but diet pop tastes like acid

@TheSnack95 @m2c0b solution.. Everyone should get iphones.  They give the 4's away.  Makes life way better
@hannahpackan most people dont live with that attitude tho.  I like the way u live haha

@BryRobbins i miss the simple conferences with mire intense games and rivalries. Hard nose michigan vs ohio state and msu. Between tackles
@DcFlowtron16 RHCP #&lt;3
I love seeing michigan finally making this transformation.
@CountryKeeeiiid yea. But they were missing albaquerque.  And valverde will be replaced dotel coke and benoit are okay. Benoit sucked i gues
@CountryKeeeiiid idk. Pretty bad in both areas
@CountryKeeeiiid consistent hitting and relief pitching
@CountryKeeeiiid okay? Victor will be the DH and still need an outfielder that can hit consistently
@CountryKeeeiiid he is the worst fielding outfielder in the mlb for 162 games. Substantially better
@CountryKeeeiiid true. Not disagreeing. But its replacing delmon with someone good everyday
@CountryKeeeiiid theres a total of 5 outfielders for 3 spots. So who knows. Id rather see hunter in than berry
@CountryKeeeiiid berry is okay. Garcia could be great and dirks is good. Im pretty sure by te time the season rolls around berry will be gon
@CountryKeeeiiid cuz we dont have a second good one
@SneakyPeanuts only makes pond hockey season more exciting

@DcFlowtron16 lets be clear.. At this point denard should stay but when gardner was a freshman they ahoulda made the switcharoo
@DcFlowtron16  gardner shoulda been qb from day 1  denard would be sick slot receiver or running back. Like deanthony thomas
