@tpwroyal yep! Curry in front of the cricket.
@tpwroyal yes an accidental drop of a poppadom or two helps!
@tpwroyal can't beat them can you 
Excellent article. So why does the housing rental market need fixing Ed Miliband? - via @Telegraph 
Middlesborough TICK. Nothing else to say. #BrightonNil #bhafc
@IanCope optimistic. I'm going for 6-0. I'll just be happy to get out of here safely. A little bit rough.
Good morning Barnsley. Thanks for giving us Chris O Grady, NOT. Now off to Middlesborough. #bhafc 
@tpwroyal I am pretty sure we can!
@tpwroyal yes like yours our season is ending with a yawn.
@Blowmonkey1 total failure by Milliband on the economy, and that's all that matters.
Game set and match to David Cameron. Absolutely destroyed Milliband. #QuestionTime
It's official, the M25 is not my best friend #carpark #m25 
@tpwroyal @federici32 curse of the keeper. Worst position on pitch. No one remembers the misses at the other end.
@tpwroyal bad luck today. They should have had you in goal.
Decent looking stadium to be fair #wiganfc #bhafc 
Massive crowd arriving at the DW stadium. Not expecting any goals.  #bhafc 
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @Arsenal that's top seagull related banter!
59th ground ticked off the list, 33 to go! #wiganfc #bhafc 
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @Arsenal sunny also in Wigan, and I can guarantee the food and drink is cheaper! Seagulls!
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @Arsenal I was thinking more #Arsenal5
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @Arsenal good luck, suspect you will see more goals than I will at Wigan v Brighton today. #BrightonNil

Great to see we @LeadersLimited are sponsoring another major international sporting event. #TheMasters #notreally 
I am not sure these two places should be located together #askingfortrouble 
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC unlikely. I'll probably be watching Wigan v Brighton. But good luck. I think you may need it. Foil FA Cup made?
I scored a goal like Charlie Adams' once. Five a side pitch though. Does that count? #baller #charlieadams

The darkest day, but well worth it for @Tog4ShortLives thank you everyone that sponsored me. 
@LeadersLimited sponsoring Horsham Sparrows. Lovely blue and white kit. #almostbhafc 
Today is first away game I've not been to for a while. Seen 1 Albion goal in the last 6 away so fully expect a 5-0 win without me. #bhafc
Another very dull away trip, no goals again. Bye bye Millwall #bhafc 
Found this sign, useful. I shall be keeping this for at least the next 30 years. #notdatingbefore50

Brentford is generally not the nicest place but you have to admire this Christmas fish bush trim. 
Good luck to Dover. Please beat Palace. Are you going @tpwroyal ? I had a good view of the Seagulls win today #bhafc 
@madDogNumberOne hmm yes you have a fair point!
Keep the Christmas beard or not? It's been lucky, 3 unbeaten seagulls matches. 
New Seagulls manager Chris Hughton is just what we need. Has an excellent record at Championship level #bhafc 
That was bloody superb. Give @cocowasp the job now #bhafc 
Two and half hours to kick. Jolly Gardener in Putney full of Brighton fans #bhafc
Heading to Craven Cottage today for the first time since 1996. Very much looking forward to it. Good luck @cocowasp #bhafc
@tpwroyal @cocowasp @ReadingFC marvellous stuff! @I_CALDERON_14 saved the day. @12CMS12 never stopped running
New lucky football socks, guaranteed victory today #bhafc 
Good luck today @cocowasp Badly need to beat @tpwroyal 's Reading #bhafc
Very happy to hear David Burke has been sacked at the Albion. My dog could smell a talented footballer better than that man #bhafc #burkeout
A bit of last minute Christmas shopping in Arundel. 
@lightpatricia2 that's certainly true! 
@JonnyDunbar and you can use for Halloween too.
@JonnyDunbar there will be a copyright charge for use of my face.
Don't you just love Christmas in the office 
Massive game coming up on boxing day @tpwroyal . Will I be seeing you at the AMEX or will you be too full of turkey to make the trip?
@JonnyDunbar yep I'm going to wear them on my head. #itscoldupnorth
Heading to Wolves today, more out of blind faith than any level of hope. #bhafc #wearegoingtolose
Farewell @mrjakedwood sad to see a fellow baldy go home #StrictlyComeDancing
The tree is up 
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC let's hope you are similarly rubbish on Boxing Day!
@tpwroyal clueless set up I'm afraid, we have a director of football who has signed rubbish, and a manager out of his depth. Sad #bhafc
@tpwroyal Tense times for your local side. Fancy the seagulls in the third round?
Ready for the game #SCOENG 
Spending the afternoon with these chaps from Slovenia #ENGvSLO 
@nationalrailenq if you're stuck at Southampton Central now and  want to get back to Worthing how long is the wait?
15 years of Stephen Grigson at Leaders.  @tpwroyal second best recruitment you've ever made #talentspotter 
@Brendanp64 yep
@wilka1983 @Brendanp64 @Ebenno88 no
@warwicksmith there aren't many companies that say you can only take holiday March to May! I'm not his biggest fan but that's harsh.
@ThickBlueLine I fancy a sneaky 1-0 win. Maybe it's just November optimism.
@warwicksmith so basically April-part way through May or December? Then you'd be moaning he wasn't getting ready for the transfer window?
Only downside I ever had at Bournemouth was forgetting their car park is pay and display and getting a ticket. Costly error. #bhafc
@warwicksmith to be fair there isn't much that you can't do remotely these days and when else should he go on holiday?
Looking forward to going to Bournemouth today. Always a good away trip. Might hit the beach first #bhafc
@JonnyDunbar arrived. Pants in position! 
Dreadful journey up to Spurs. Left at 2pm and still not there yet. #bhafc
Just took the dog up Cissbury Ring 
@lightpatricia2 actually I think she's a bit cleaner now!

@Suspolfootball I have a hunch they include the mostly empty Club Wembley and any other no shows.
Wembley moon #ENGvSAN #Wembley 
Sitting at Wembley @Suspolfootball can you tell me do England attendances count the numbers sold like #bhafc or those that attend? #eng
#bhafc are very an enigma to me. Too much playing well without scoring. Unbeaten in four but only won one of them. #bhafc
@THORPEPARK this was very scary 
@tpwroyal from you that means so much more!

@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @Boro yep good win that. All to play for. Everyone will beat everyone this season I think with Forest doing a Leicester
Two weeks ago I was predicting he seagulls would finish 10th, now I fancy the top two! So many attacking options #bhafc

@tpwroyal the Royals seem to have slipped below us. Shame.
Much much better performance at the AMEX today. Took this shot @BHASnappy #bhafc 
@VickyHale77 I might as well have done, seagulls were dreadful!
pre match @VillageMoseley .Steak &amp; Stilton Pie, Mash and Veg. Very friendly staff as well. #bhafc #villagevibe 
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC we look dreadful at the moment
First away game of the season. Not particularly confident,  although Birmingham are really poor we are not much better! #bhafc
In Nandos in Cardiff, but can't see @craignoone where are you? #bhafc #ccfc
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC I would certainly take that!
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC we are about three good players short of challenging. Mid table if we don't get those I fear.
Lovely @OfficialBHAFC #bhafc

@tpwroyal what's this rumour that Reading may be going bust, time to get Waggot's massive wallet out?

Oh lord. A straight BHA v Reading fight then on Saturday. Come on Burnley. Prediction @tpwroyal #bhafc
@tpwroyal @JonnyDunbar @hallcarpet I have more confidence in Donnie doing you than Burnley.
@JonnyDunbar @hallcarpet @tpwroyal yep love them!
Praying for wins for Burnley, Doncaster and Bournemouth tomorrow #bhafc
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet @JonnyDunbar @ReadingFC Middlesborough have nothing to play for, Doncaster do #Mattfingerscrossed
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet @JonnyDunbar @ReadingFC it's not over yet. I wouldn't fancy Reading's trip to Doncaster on Saturday. Still wide open
Ridiculously tight now @hallcarpet @JonnyDunbar badly need Reading to slip up tomorrow @tpwroyal
@MattlightBHA should add @light_annabel helped me! #bakeoff
I actually made this! Amazing! Cake for Eirene's birthday tomorrow #bakeoff 
@tpwroyal just leaving Leicester, unbelievable performance. All to play for. #bhafc
Then went on Christmas present tour of Wembley today. Very impressive but not as good as the AMEX #wembley 
Had a great weekend at Barnsley on Saturday #bhafc 
@tpwroyal looks like Reading have sixth spot in the bag. Having wasted Saturday seeing us look inept can't see us catching you now #bhafc
@shells83 definitely need to realise that sometimes you just need to hit it early. Too many goal shy players at the moment.
@shells83 none of the players turned up for that one. Couldn't say that today. They tried hard enough but just didn't quite get it right.
@shells83 yep that was a real Mark McGhee no show day!
@shells83 that is certainly part of the problem. I'm just enjoying it. Every game is still brilliant compared to Withdean.
@hallcarpet @JonnyDunbar I still think we will sneak in!!
@shells83 I get that but ten times more people leave early when we are losing. That's not supporting your team.
@JonnyDunbar @hallcarpet more like cock up the Albion today! We were almost as Forest. We could both miss out.
@hallcarpet @JonnyDunbar I am hoping we fair better. Only a draw needed to go above you #bhafc
Oh dear @hallcarpet early days though. Forest come back? @JonnyDunbar
Just testing the new digital stadium app. Not in the stadium though #bhafc
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet @JonnyDunbar this is the run in. And no I didn't do this. Not quite that statto 
Saw these lovely fellas earlier. Took an unnatural interest in us and the dog. #cissburyring 
@hallcarpet @tpwroyal @JonnyDunbar Wigan are certs I think unless the cup distracts them. Can't see Reading doing it. Forest v BHA I suspect
@hallcarpet @tpwroyal @JonnyDunbar it's certainly tight. Two places available between Wigan, Brighton, Forest and Reading. In that order....
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet blimey it's close for that sixth place now. #bhafc
@tpwroyal yep fear you are right. Although one of us could still catch faltering Forest.
@tpwroyal all square for the season then. Ref changed game with a soft sending off. Adkins is still an odious little man isn't he?!
@deltarecruiters they let us go at about 5.30, 35 mins after final whistle. More due to better stewarding and manual traffic light control
@tpwroyal good response. I shall have a  cheeky coke today, don't want to overdo it! #lightweight #butnotfat
@tpwroyal don't worry I will have a pie for you. Not the five you would probably despatch though <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><HAMBURGER><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @BHAFC don't think we can both make it sadly, unless Forest fall apart. I think 0-0 or 1-0 to us.
However not looking forward to the nonsense that is the Bennett's Field car park. Locked in for 45 minutes+ . Odd decision #bhafc
Looking forward to the six pointer at the AMEX today. @tpwroyal score prediction for your Royals? #bhafc #royals
The day went rapidly downhill!! #Macmillan 
It's wear it green day for 
@Suspolfootball hopefully better on Saturday. Will we be seeing you at Millwall?
@Suspolfootball were you giving our new loan signing extra security?
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC on way back from Derby. Well done!!!!
@tpwroyal yep could see us getting to top five but top two too far away. But you never know!
Puncheon missed penalty against Tottenham. #COYS 
@tpwroyal tucked in nicely in 6th now, and rising. You'll never catch us. #bhafc
@tpwroyal yep our reserves beat your reserves! The joy of the FA Cup. We hit the woodwork three times too #bhafc #easyeasy
@tpwroyal after returning from Blackpool I see that we are now above you!! You'll never catch us now!! #bhafc
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC you're just three points better off now, and you couldn't score in your own back yard against us. I was there!
@tpwroyal hope you are not expecting to go too far in the FA Cup this season.... #bhafc
@tpwroyal perfect thank you. Shame the Royals fell apart to the Muff
@tpwroyal very good! We may need that luck today #bhafc
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @hallcarpet impressive win. Hope we follow you up the table tomorrow
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet can only see one winner now and it isn't the Royals!
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet oh yes #bhafc
@tpwroyal @hallcarpet @ReadingFC @EsUnPiens one more Forest goal and a seagulls win tomorrow puts us ahead of you both!! #bhafc
@tpwroyal @ReadingFC @EsUnPiens long way to go yet. @hallcarpet won't be happy

@tpwroyal about to head to Portman Road, we need to get a move on! #late

@tpwroyal I was quite impressed by Derby, good solid team. Could see you losing that one
@hallcarpet she says whilst tweeting at 12.15am........
@VickyHale77 very good!!
This just came up on my rack playing words with friends! @LeadersLettings 
@tpwroyal I am getting quietly confident that we will be up there. Not so sure about your lot though. #bhafc
@tpwroyal just got back. Thought we were the better team, ref rubbish for both sides. Royals looked very average.
@tpwroyal probably just have a Waggott Wheel #maggotman
@tpwroyal it's true, I am in your debt forever. I'll ask Oscar to let your lot have one shot then #bhafc #foiltheroyal
@tpwroyal I learnt everything I know from you on that score!! Not very much #dodgy
@tpwroyal Royals 1 Seagulls 3. Ulloa will destroy your slow back four. #bhafc #easyeasy
@tpwroyal I hope you get a good spot in front of the telly. Would hate you to miss seeing me jump up and down each time we score #bhafc
@LeadersLettings thank goodness I didn't venture near the dance floor! Unlike @hinchystryder spotted on this video!
@BHASnappy I can see me!

@LeadersLettings @LeadersHants Leaders in Eastleigh on Sky News #Eastleigh #leaderslettings 
Love your property........love Leaders 
@LeadersLettings Ulloa equalising goal against Arsenal made all the more special by the backdrop to his celebration! 
@ConradMontgomer sorry tickets not available anymore. Thanks anyway.
@thedagger4 sorry tickets not available now I'm afraid. Thanks anyway.
@AlisonGuyton don't worry I will be there as always. These tickets were a present I bought for someone else who is now ill and can't go.
I have 2 tickets for the West Stand Lower for BHA v Newcastle tomorrow. Face value £39 each. Will sell the pair for £40. Message me. RT pls
@david07montero @leaderslettings @bendotdavies that will detract from the brand. Get that board down. Another half empty Selhurst.
@david07montero @leaderslettings @leaderslondon that makes me sick. Leaders are BHA born.  Good to see Zaha staying on his feet for once.
@light_annabel @lightpatricia2 we have just been to see Bond, very good #007
@12CMS12 RT if you were accosted by a bald fan as you left your breakfast this morning. Forget the hat trick comment I'll take a brace. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Just for Mr Light Senior!!!! 
@ThickBlueLine @thisiscranebags @mattpott @wilko808 @mattysparrow10 misread that for a moment,thought you said something else!!! #mattpower
This ram won't be smiling later once the seagulls have swooped #BHAFC

Leaders Lettings Awards Ball 2012: 
@Doogie_Bear oh dear, what were you doing agreeing to this!! I'm asking for a refund on my Herald! 
@leaderslettings annual ball. Staff join in on thriller dance. #leadersball  
@TheFear_dance were brilliant at the @LeadersLettings ball last night. Really brilliant. Well done to @AlisonGuyton for booking them!!
And brilliant dance routine too @AlisonGuyton @LeadersLettings #LeadersBall  
Well done @AlisonGuyton for organising the best @LeadersLettings ball ever!!! Can't wait for next year #LeadersBall
Fantastic entertainment at @LeadersLettings annual ball #leadersball 
@LeadersLettings @bendotdavies @kathytleaders @hinchystryder @david07montero looking forward to it!! #LeadersBall
No coincidence that @BHAFC are now the leaders of the championship. Thanks to lucky @LeadersLettings board #BHAFC 
Brilliant win for @BHAFC eight goals in two home games since lucky @LeadersLettings advertising board moved to North Stand!! #bhafc
New @LeadersLettings cars looking very lovely although could do with a few random Seagulls dotted about. #bhafc 
Off to the England game today with @samlight48 and @Doogie_Bear
@david07montero if it was just down to me we would buy every board at the AMEX!!! #bhafc
@Doogie_Bear Hammond is great, and unlike you has great boots!! #BHAFC #Hammond
Excellent signings by #BHAFC today. Lucky Leaders Lettings board will be seeing premiership football next season.
@craignoone about to create the fifth goal for @BHAFC in front of the very lucky @LeadersLettings board #BHAFC 
Told you it would be big win for the seagulls!! FIVE lovely goals. Must have been the lucky @LeadersLettings advertising board that did it!
And hoping the @LeadersLettings advertising board will be in position in the North West corner. The lucky corner. Big win for the seagulls.
Although @BHAFC have not won for 158 days I confidently predict a complete thumping of Barnsley today. We always beat them at home
So glad I decided not to go and watch @SussexCCC at 20:20 in Cardiff. It's going to rain!!! Off to the AMEX instead.Big win for the seagulls
Blue sky at the cricket. Wow! #sussexccc 
@scott_mills I am gobsmacked to have just seen you for the first time. That is all. #notwhatiexpectedfromlisteningtoyourvoice
@DarrenMcKay I did that but the dog didn't last long next to that #iteatsdogs
It's a bloody big stag beetle I believe! So huge it took a lot of manly courage to throw it over next doors fence #badneighbour
@dr_wen @darrenmckay I hope he is checking out what creature we have in the shed?!!! #scared
@DarrenMcKay try this then. Nightmares galore 
What the hell is this found in the shed? #scary  
@ThickBlueLine Scottish? #spider
What type of spider is this? #spider 
Finally a BGT winner to be proud of. I love that dog!! #BGT #Pudsey
@ESFS_Albion @thickblueline it is the only way. Kept going with mine and now he is a proud AMEX Sth. It's more than worth it in the end!!
@BrettMendoza brilliant effort. Well done all #remf
@ThickBlueLine simple answer yes!!! All levels of indoctrination must be used to repel the evils of Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal etc #BHAFC
@BrettMendoza well done Brett and the team. Do you know how much you raised? #remf
@BrettMendoza it was Mattock, according to him.
@mattysparrow10 any chance of a retweet for my sons AMEX video he is very proud of

Happy birthday to Leaders client accounts and footballing legend @hinchystryder #probablypissedagain
A frankly pitiful banner from Ipswich fans, but the @LeadersLettinngs board looks good!!!! #bhafc #itfc 
Disgraceful banner from Ipswich fans today. I'm baffled as to what that was all about. Three points, 3-0, thanks Ipswich. #bhafc #itfc
Happy birthday @12CMS12 looking good in this picture. #bhafc 
But I'm keeping warm due to the CUP FEVER!!!!!!! #bhafc #lfc #facup
Unsurprisingly it's seriously cold in Liverpool tonight. Very cold wind coming off the Mersey. #bhafc
Players warming up #BHAFC #lufc 
@Suspolfootball hmm given your allegiances I think your report may just say "Dear Gus, they're crap, love Daz"
@Suspolfootball so are you at Old Trafford today then? Can you make sure a few of the Liverpool players get injured for next week please.
Nice sunny day here in Leeds, but suspect if I get out of bed I may find it is very cold!!!! #BHAFC #lufc
@hinchystryder flippin eck, you lot breed like rabbits!!!! #hinshfamily
So I'm making the HUGE mistake of sitting with Leeds fans with a workmate tomorrow. What was I thinking of?! #BHAFC #lufc
So Fabio has gone. Good riddance. Bring on a Harry Rednapp and Stuart Pearce combo. Worried Gus will end up at Spurs though #capello
Going in the home end at Leeds with a friend. I must be mad #BHAFC #lufc
Heading to Anfield for the first time in 21 years.  Last time we came away with a draw. I reckon we will win this time! #BHAFC
@Suspolfootball I'm guessing a home draw would make your life easier though!! Crawley away would be hard work #ticketscrum
@Suspolfootball who is your counterpart at Crawley? Might be an interesting follow after the draw today!!! #FACup #BHAFC
@BrettMendoza it was brilliant, bet you are well gutted.
@Suspolfootball @kmoorman1968 I agree with Kieren, Crawley away would be worst draw possible. don't want Stoke away either #solastyear
Two things

1) Brighton won a big cup game this week

2) Palace lost a big cup game this week

Shame

#greatweek #BHAFC #CPFC
@Suspolfootball so if getting train back to Worthing will it be best to change at Haywards Heath or go to Brighton? Are the connections gd?
I've become strangely addicted to Sherlock Holmes, Series Two, Episode One. Must have watched it ten times now! Weird! #sherlockholmes
It's over an hour later but would it churlish to still be laughing at others misfortune? No? Okay then Hahahahahahahahahahaha #gladallover
@danwalkerbbc just a shame for Palace that Zaha left hose bags of talent in the changing rooms along with his team mates bags of class #scum
@danwalkerbbc only because the Palace players had forgotten they were there. #soquiet
Cardiff, just put it in the net. Please. #CPFC
If there is justice in football Cardiff will be going to Wembley as Palace are dreadful, just dreadful. But sadly I'm fearing a breakaway.
“@shells83: Fuck off my tv Murray you prick” Quality #FFSMurray
I'm predicting a 2-0 win today for the mighty Seagulls @12CMS12 and @lewisdunk to score #bhafc
@david07montero well done, that's another 14 days of non payment to the scum earned! #leaveit
I have finally given up on my local paper. Disgraceful behaviour to name and shame potentially five innocent young men. #boycotttheargus
@BevRush eek. He was playing very well, hope he is okay.
@BevRush fair enough! Playing well so far #annoyingly
First time I have ever sat down to an evening looking forward to watching ESPN #bhafc
@BHAFerret @suspolfootball that's what a good Durrington High School education does for you!! #spellingschmelling
Big win for the Seagulls today #feelinginmybones
@AndyNaylorArgus and you got that wrong originally because?
What do the QPR owners expect from this season - top four???? #qprjokers
@PaulCamillin @brightongirl20 he only scored twice didn't he?! Or was it once?!!!! I know I had a t shirt saying "I saw Farrington score!!"
Alan Pardew just shat himself whilst @kazenga25 is doing backflips round his garden #bhavnewcastlemaybe
@Mareschappie good thought! Best get on with it then! #notlongtogo
So I'm cheering on City cos I hate United but a draw would mean less chance of WrexhamvBHA replay being on telly #conundrum
@hinchystryder oh dear, I won't bother to drive to Oxford to watch then!!
@sarah_whitey @gbarlowofficial good shout! I asked @rihanna to join us but she was worried she was going to be outclassed by you #whitelight
@sarah_whitey do we need to write a song or are we doing a cover version? #imdreamingofaWHITEchristmas

@AlisonMitchell have missed your cricket tweets. Welcome back!! Where's @Aggerscricket
Fearing a cup shock today. Wrexham are a team on a roll winning games. We are putting out a weakened team. Worried. #facup

@clairelangton baffles me why people leave so early. In @BrettMendoza case it's for the beer #alcoholic

Loving these pics of @kazenga25  Shame no one got one of Tanno's brilliant celebration though. 
@david07montero true class will always rise above cheats and scum.
@david07montero just twice. Brighton lost their ground, played at Gillingham for two years and an athletics track for 12. But no admin
@david07montero given their record of going into admin and not paying their suppliers including local charities I won't be paying it quickly
@david07montero life! Thats what the Looters should have got! #croydonscum
@david07montero we won't be paying it anyway so tell them not to waste their toilet paper
@david07montero I'd rather be in Wales than Croydon for sure, but we all know Brighton pisses all over both of them! #theplacetobe
@david07montero 849k in Wales #totalwasteofmoney
@david07montero hmm yep huge ratings for Cardiff v Palace #totalwasteofmoney
@david07montero Murray is shite as his penalty on Saturday showed #goodriddancewehaveCMS
@david07montero @official_cpfc yep well done. Keep this distraction going and league one won't be far away. #FFSMurray
@david07montero heart? More like the arsehole!
@david07montero they will finish below us, FACT. They play in a shithole which you/others have decided to associate us with #dreadful
@BrettMendoza @gullys_girls health and safety alert, you could have dropped that on my head!!! #careless
8 hours! 720 minutes, 43,200 seconds since Palace last scored. Shame. #FFSMurray
Delighted to see Judas miss a penalty today, bet lots of Palace fans were saying #FFSMurray
@Suspolfootball assume you will be arresting Peter Walton for the act of daylight robbery he perpetrated this afternoon? #ignorancenodefence
@david07montero sadly not for me. I expected Saints to run away with it. And us to be closer to the playoffs. Too many injuries though atm.
@david07montero it was the second goal and Tanno got so irate about it he got sent off! So it sealed the game. Could well of lost anyone tho
Worst refereeing decision I have ever seen today by Peter Walton of Northamptonshire at Saints v BHA #incompetent
@Suspolfootball keep your ears pricked! I have a feeling you may be a busy man tomorrow!
Gus Poyet is not racist. He is just a very honest man. Not enough of them in football @rioferdy5 and Fergie #guslegend

Excellent night at Negotiator Awards. Leaders - Employer of the Year.

Congratulations to all the deserved award winners and @david07montero for being the highlight of the comedian Adam Bloom's night! #funnyish
Fantastic Leaders Ball last night. Everyone had a great time, and some could even manage to stand by the end of the evening #miracle
Alex Ferguson saying vote labour???!!!!!! Good lord, I can hear the avalanche of people rushing to the Tories #sticktofootball
@Suspolfootball and yes I may be feeling sour grapes! That said we got out of Bennetts Field bloody quickly!!! #everycloudhasasilverlining
@Suspolfootball police were great and stepped in quickly but I think it proved that they don't deserve to be given this respect next time
@Suspolfootball it was not a lot of fun shielding my son and father from very aggressive Palace fans tonight.
@Suspolfootball would be interested to hear your view on future Palace games and whether their fans should be kept behind next time.
@sports_saturday I would take beating Palace and 15 points. Bitterly disappointed tonight. Outclassed.
@richardpbacon some kind of nightmare?
@AndyNaylorArgus "wiv???" #sunjournalist
