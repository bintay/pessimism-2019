@AnaUlrici exactly. I caught myself wondering if I should post one since it's all I post and I was like wtf why do I even care
There are many things in this world we feel ashamed about, but wanting to feel loved or interesting or appreciated should not be one of them
I posts pics of myself cause my confidence is not always where it should be and it helps to see that someone would take a sec to like my pic
It's okay to seek attention. It's okay for art to be nothing more than beautiful. It's okay to want a compliment.

@hachmeifyoucan it's crazy how young we all were back then, I literally thought I knew everything then
Five years ago I thought I loved someone who never took care of me and I'm so glad I had my heart broken when I did, funny how life changes
People really need to stop acting like liking materialistic things are bad. It isn't negative until you stop appreciating your good fortune
ok if you're naturally skinny and eat bad food on a normal occasion than you CANNOT TALK BAD ABOUT A BIGGER PERSON EATING BAD FOOD
Your baby may change genders while in the womb, so why can't your baby change genders outside of it too?
I want a world where we teach our daughters self defense because she is strong and capable not because of fear that she is weak and a target

I don't like pumpkin pie, salted Carmel, or anything tea flavored... Am I even a girl? Who knows.
@hachmeifyoucan It's like a little competition with myself cuz it kills me when people say they've only read like six books in their life!
@hachmeifyoucan I what?!
Like it will never not blow my mind that 1200 books are all made from the same 26 letters...
Tried to do the math and with me reading on average about a 100 books every year since I was seven, that puts me at around 1200 books...

As soon as the mps left one of my neighbors helped me rip all of the fire alarms off haha
@JoshCrawford7 tell her not to switch off the breaker haha otherwise it'll be dark and they will still all be going off
@JoshCrawford7 there was literally like 6 wives on my lawn saying the same thing happened to them hahaha
The entire fire department just came to my house because my alarms were going off because of a dead battery and I couldn't stop them lol

Actually I look so dumb asking about the naked juice when I'm eating a lunchable. But I havnt had one in like 12 years so it was a treat
Are naked juices one of those juices that seem healthy but are really bad for you?I have no idea how to tell how many grams is a lot
Naked juice and lunchable for dinner while watching Hannah Montana... Today's turned out pretty good
Quickest way to big the shit out of me is too make unnecessary excuses to explain why you do certain things

@HDGxHBG ooh I know what one your talking about! I've heard good stuff about that one. Shaaanxo on YouTube does swatches of them all!

If you wear mascara to accentuate your eyelashes you MAY NOT make fun of people who fill in their eyebrows to accentuate them
Which is totally sad, why can't people understand you can love the appearance of someone without being IN LOVE with them
I love belly buttons, butts and boobs, and puffy lips, and I feel like I can never explain my love for women without people assuming things

Having a dream I'm suffocating and wake up to my puppy literally laying across my face....
I can honestly tell you there is not a single thing I miss about Sacramento other than my family, camping, Starbucks, and my old bed.
I would literally give my life for a ice soy Carmel macchiato like I'm literally dying why doesn't Italy have a starbucks<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Italy's weather is kinda like a mini rainforest. Hot and humid as fuck with sporadic lightening storms aka my running is not doing well.

Honestly Italian men love their choker necklaces way to much
Made a literally two minute phone call in Germany to my mom and it cost fucking three hundred dollars. What. The. Actual. Fuck.
Left over pasta and some wine for breakfast? When in Rome.... (Or Vicenza)
The most frustrating thing about Italy so far is Taco Bell doesn't sell Baja blast. Like the workers didn't even know what Mountain Dew was
This is the worst thunder and lightening I've ever expierenced and Wayne is just snoring through it <CONFOUNDED FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> and I usually like storms!
I guess I have to jog to the store anyway because wut is this

Just watched the first episode of AHS with Wayne and that shit is so freaky<FLUSHED FACE>
That was the most insane workout
Army men love listening to miley cyrus and Ellie goulding apparently
Lunch was gyros from a street vendor <SMIRKING FACE>

@TextDeity the fear women have when walking down the street isn't only sexual. It's being taken advantage of in any sense of the word
@TextDeity Many of the fears I listed that women have, have an end result of never seeing their family's again or starting their own
@TextDeity not to mention the fear it might happen to your mother or daughter or cousins or aunts or bestfriends?
@TextDeity what might you fear more than being objectified, robbed, beaten, raped and/or tortured?
@TextDeity that even worse. Don't you see something wrong with the fact that even then men don't have to worry about abuse the way women do?
@TextDeity @Tori_ashley1732 the majority of men that fear abuse of any kind in prison far outweigh the men that don't  so #yesallwomen

@kristieemartinn her posts are so god damn annoying<LOUDLY CRYING FACE> like seriously the trashiest girl ever
Swear to god one of my "friends" on Facebook said "who even uses protection these days" then proceeds to brag about not using it in 2 years
Too fucking excited that in less than 2 weeks I can walk around MY house without pants on
This will soon be in my life<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@missbehaave 
There's this girl I went to elementary with and I'm seriously obsessed with everything her and her sister post on insta and I feel creepy<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Gunna miss all the pretty colors in my hair<PENSIVE FACE> 
Dave Franco is in Greek on netflix<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> love this show more and more everyday
Chilling outside right now would be so peaceful if I wasn't allergic to Mosquito bites
@KMCGIGGIN I mean this so sincerely, whatever makes you happy
@Brittany_Yap Iv tried to talk to Katie. That's the thing. And either nothing changed or I get told im a child. So I stopped dealing with it
@Brittany_Yap I just don't understand why I have to get attacked when she has a huge group of friends she hangs out with anyway
@Brittany_Yap I've explained to Katie a million times what hurts my feelings and it just kept happening.
@Brittany_Yap why? She subtweeted me so I should explain myself? That's not fair at all.
Tweeting about how I'm immature is obviously not going to make me want to text her anything nice?
@Brittany_Yap my grandparents were over &amp; I wanted to wait to give her my full attention but she immediately started jumping to conclusions
@KMCGIGGIN ok one my husband is a little different then a bf and I even if I have no friends I don't get why your mad at me
@Brittany_Yap I'm not treating anyone like garbage I have not said one thing that was mean to Katie I just don't understand what the prob is
It's just crazy to me that people think your happiness and well being depends on them and their friendship
Saying something nice to someone doesn't count if you expect something in return lol
I'm hella pissed that my lip tattoo is not fading because I really want the word RAD instead lol
@Brittany_Yap even my parents know to just leave me alone until after I've done my hair haha
“@Brittany_Yap: If I let my hair dry naturally around you I'm EXTREMELY comfortable with you” the most relatable statement I've ever read
Well I'm never sleeping tonight
You know you're growing up when you're smoking hookah and a blunt, while drinking a mikes with your family
Fuck youuu
I just want to drowned my sorrows in raw fish and tempura
Does it count if my favorite features are my tattoos? 
“@emyxraine: hair/face/eyebrows/makeup/body/room goals wow 
I seriously hate Mexican food but it's all my family eats like Jesus kill me
My mom told my sister that if she hadn't got in trouble then she could go to parties if I took her.... I would never
