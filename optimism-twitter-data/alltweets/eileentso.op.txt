@Cohen_Goes_HAM I just finished watching "Salmon Fishing In The Yemen" (fiction) on BBC2 #gotyoubeat #oldladybedtime
@Cohen_Goes_HAM wasn't planning on it; think that's a mistake?
@SarahRapp +1
@wonderlandblog ugh
@Amirmizroch did you see it was a fake account which has since been shut down? see @JoshBBornstein
@overdrev crazy how accurate the exit polling was
@dabeeeenster ...I do maintain Labour would not do any different on this matter (fwiw)
@dabeeeenster if I'd replied earlier I'd have said who knows if she'll even be Home Secretary (wishfully hoping not)... now tbh I dunno but
@Cohen_Goes_HAM ikr? still v surreal to me (could be lack of sleep)... historic, unprecedented and astounding no matter how one voted/hoped
.@BBCNews website now updated with the official final count... 331 to Conservatives #GE2015 
@_MarkByrne fwiw, my pov/2p here (Cameron doesn't want to leave the EU and I don't think UK voters do either): 
@justinvekinis congratulations!!
@Amirmizroch thank you, sorry on my phone I got what seemed like live blog updates (apols!)
@Amirmizroch where? sorry couldn't see in that link

@BenFletch @Ronin_Jim amazing (and yes abs re Lib Dems)

Con—325

SNP—56
LDem—12 (on 6 now)
@muradahmed :(
@TheStalwart wow re your RT of Labour press team... denial
@Nero noooooo stay up!
@covert did you see the exit poll ? predicted 58 seats to SNP
@digitalmaverick well I'm sorry b/c I know you are gutted and I am genuinely sad for you but (naively?) hope we can improve things together
@indexben it's all good ;)
@TheStalwart fyi 
@indexben depending on when you placed those bets you should be a v happy man!
@benjrooney stay up with us!
@indexben now you say... ;)
@jjluff I've tried a couple of times but riveted
@azeem thank god they have school and it's not Saturday/Sunday... !
fk it, I'm not sleeping tonight am I? #GE2015
@Josh_CityIndex @blackbullion @TheStalwart agreed
@digitalmaverick sorry Drew... I know how you feel. let's hope though we can all help improve govt generally
thank you ! :) 
@TheStalwart yes sir
@leighblue @TheStalwart correct re how I voted, but nonetheless I am blown away by what's happening
@TheStalwart sorry your RT of @Josh_CityIndex... what is happening is absolutely astounding. so far off from what was predicted by 11 polls!
fwiw even if their opinion polling calcs didn't work, @May2015NS still the best to follow tonight/everything #GE2015 
@TheStalwart omg omg omg !!!
@mstephanblome so far the swings are all going to same way... for Conservatives
@mstephanblome wow another bigger swing even more than exit poll predicted... abs amazing
@mstephanblome riveting, isn't it?!

@eddowding not really, I'm still on knife's edge!
@sohear @ravmattu I choose to manage an early stage (small) fund w/low fees... and have 4 young kids growing up here. it's not money for me
@jmaskell sorry man...
@ravmattu did you see this by @sohear? even Labour supporters were disappointed by lack of engagement by Labour 
@tobyjwalsh @ravmattu you may not believe me but no sir
@ravmattu well that is the question/concern. last 12-18 mos I proactively worked on relationships w/others. clear diff in reaction/approach
@ravmattu not kill, but not support as proactively
@Ronin_Jim @BenFletch I'm still in shock (not quite ready to believe it, still worried!)
@johndodds oh no, my run is over now that the readers panel for the election has ended
@johndodds haha no but I might be in there 2x (oops). once for readers panel/election and once re work/London startups
@BenFletch unbelievable... I am ecstatic but terrified (do we rely on it??)
@BenFletch I'd be happy with that !
and to think I thought #indyref back in September was a nail-biter...
@PowSalad hehe just teasing! def appreciate your kind words; pretty sure not all my Twitter followers thought comments to be rational ;)
@hannahprevett lol or maybe he's a NYC cabbie who was on your flight? love how committed he is to your vote getting cast!
@chesh you overachievers you
@PowSalad ah yes ok was me, but wdym you didn't know... you thought maybe 2 diff Asian/Chinese women named Eileen Burbidge in London? :)
def more credit than due (but I'll quote it anyway); was great fun + privilege to be on ES #GE2015 readers panel 
@PowSalad erm well, put that way it probably wasn't?! you mean the #GE2015 readers panel specifically?
@Ronin_Jim v nice sir!
@Highgatemums don't worry, I got your back on this one
pretty damn cool "can locate people hidden behind 20 feet of solid concrete or buried beneath 30 feet of rubble"... 
hahaha @Highgatemums gets all bad ass

@mycology ...really appreciate your saying so
thank you v much

@dabeeeenster super easy for them to say, v different when in position
@dabeeeenster call me a cynic but find it v hard to believe Greens or Lib Dems would have legislated any differently had they been in power
@dabeeeenster genuinely don't believe what Snowden exposed is party-specific at all (much broader/bigger than that)
@dabeeeenster you think Labour or other major parties wouldn't have had broadly same policies? Snowden revelations exposed pre-2010 data too

@mavenclinic hilarious!
@arctictony congrats!
@benjilanyado yep, so to each their own (
and everyone should be able to do/say/vote as they want. we can agree to agree -- or disagree :)
@benjilanyado I think highlighting any bit of it (at all) is good; ppl will always interpret as they like/wish
@benjilanyado great! and if you tell me you're going to vote a certain way for that, I'm happy for you (I don't have any issue with it)
@benjilanyado didn't say it was. just said (personally) I prefer policies and pledges of one party over another (for variety of reasons)
@davesavage_1984 sure thing; eileenburbidge at gmail
@benjilanyado there are indications they would def review. lib dems have already said they'd restrict entrepreneurs tax relief
@benjilanyado it's a tight election. I saw a lot of undecideds and more apathy. if ppl dis-/agree w/me all good as long as they vote at all
@MrHarriEvans sure, email is eileenburbidge at gmail
@davesavage_1984 hadn't heard of inspire (looks good); had heard of aspire (all good) :)
@benjilanyado if people think I'm a dickhead ok, but I'm confident my founders know that I'm just expressing my own 2p (as I v often do)
@benjilanyado well that didn't have any names/individuals (just anonymised survey results). as to why I spoke out it's b/c ppl asked me to
no idea # of respondents, but absolutely no contest in this poll (82% said better off under government led by...)

@ealexhudson argh
@johndodds damnit
@jmaskell gahhhhh :)
I'll say one more thing on the topic (less controversial I hope): I can't wait for this "tightest in a generation" election to be over
@firstconversion :) that's not actually what I said/implied (I watched and engaged w/all 3 major parties) but I respect your diff of opinion
@Abhi_Times ps hadn't thought about it b4 to track/monitor but would've been interesting to see # followers lost/gained since I "came out"
@firstconversion 2/2 can only go by what I witnessed for myself (re digital and economy overall but def believe that's how you fund NHS etc)
@firstconversion 1/2 wow. do you feel that way because of Tory heritage or? I'm first time voter and have only been studying up last 2yrs...
@Recruitabroad thank you (appreciate all the back up I can get here) ;)
@Abhi_Times ;) but I get it: tech traditionally liberal/left-wing and tbh I'm not typically "conservative type" but I believe in the economy
@Appeos @matthewcford exactly, if voters are appropriately informed they'll make the right choice and put it to bed once and for all
@matthewcford 3/3 Cameron has reiterated again and again he doesn't want to leave EU and his team feel same else wouldn't bother w/DSM etc
@matthewcford 2/3 now also see holding the referendum (threat to leave) creates much-needed leverage for renegotiating key points w/EU
@matthewcford 1/3 I used to be wary of same, but realise that means I didn't trust voters to cast the right vote (stay in EU) = unfair of me
I believe they've been key for UK digital/economy (now 10% GDP), and strong economy = best way to fund social svcs 
@firstconversion :( guess you meant that as a compliment? (if so, thanks) why hard to believe? (but sorry to disappoint/surprise)
here was @techworldnews' take from last week: UK’s leading tech entrepreneurs rally behind Tory party

@daniellenewnham I read the article and saw they were coming to end of the run but also saw they're under investigation (seemed OTT)
@arajanathan agree but why ban it or even take offence to it?
@ToniCowanBrown totally agree
@orliesaurus you see where I'm going with all this right? ;)
@Cohen_Goes_HAM @MichelleDBeadle she wasn't only one

ok maybe I'll cut back to 1 Coke a day... #yeahright #happinessisacoke 
@belindaparmar @HouseofCards what do we do/watch until next season??
@nmurchu @stevegraham hm. methinks people are weird (obvs I must be too!)
@Cohen_Goes_HAM ...and therefore deserves to be banned? odd no?
@agit8or best explanation I've heard/seen (that actually makes sense) :)
@lisafleisher exactly (size zero models etc etc)
@joshuamarch totally agree. and from what I read/saw this campaign had male and female versions
@AndyWilliams81 I don't get it. best explanation from someone else is well-orchestrated PR campaign by company itself to get more exposure
@nmurchu @stevegraham and fashion adverts or "lifestyle" adverts showing scantily clad photoshopped bodies are not?
@stevegraham I don't get it. not sure how they're more sexist than any other advert or poster w/a woman in a bikini or topless 6-pack guy ?
just asking to be flamed but if this is sexist enough to be banned how are not all fashion ads + photo-shoots/shops?

@JamesLiamCook @lisafleisher as I think you saw, we didn't ask ppl who they were voting for in the letter. explained who we were and why
@adamamyl thank you very much sir
@kirjatoukka @lisafleisher I chose to tell people why I'm voting the way I choose. you should do same
@adamamyl oh sry maybe you were being sincere? apols I thought you were teasing because of my typo (which is making me cringe)
@adamamyl ikr? saw it right after posting but figured I'd let it stand (give doubters more to play with)

@PaulLomax @christianhern followed all closely. but 1 was over 1yr ago and nothing since. manifesto def didn't incl anything re S/EIS etc
@rorybernard @PaulLomax @christianhern FYI this lays out EU matter/risks well imho 
@covert fair enough but I'm sure you have nothing to worry about ;)
@covert lulu public, encourages men to sign up via own app and channels
@rorybernard @PaulLomax @christianhern ...but reform of EU would be good. it's a game of chicken but can be sorted+put to bed once/for all
@rorybernard @PaulLomax @christianhern leaving EU wld suck. you highlight yr (and my) worry of voters to make wrong call if given choice :)
@PaulLomax @christianhern btw thank you for engaging/prompting debate and q's. I respect everyone/all diff views, just glad/want ppl engage!
@covert look at the reviews; I do. they're not trolling unless you think yelp/tripadvisor etc all trolling platforms too
@PaulLomax @christianhern my point was change would bring slow of momentum via min 6 mo reviews of budgets/programmes. I still stand by that
@covert I wondered who'd be first to try and compare ;) Lulu abs not about trolling, quite the opposite... have a look
@PaulLomax @christianhern some of the programmes were put in place by New Labour which EM takes pains to say they are definitely not
@PaulLomax @christianhern so why haven't they at highest levels come out/said so (like Tories) or anything else positive re digital economy?
@PaulLomax @christianhern oh yes it did. I expressly remember because our own ECF  mandate decision was put on hold for 6 mos after last GE
@PaulLomax @christianhern momentum, if only because of 6 month (new) govt reviews etc (no question)
@PaulLomax @christianhern ... review/cap S/EIS (Lib Dems have said they'd restrict Entrepreneurs Tax Relief). any change would def slow the

@Nero @azeem as I understand and Milo says, ppl had to click thru on website/ack and type in details to submit. dunno other deets/specifics
@hannahprevett can't wait to meet IRL, but forgive me in advance as am a bit unwell... usually more energetic and not carrying sick bags (!)
@covert @dctanner yep hence my almost bothering any of you or @BenedictEvans + @danprimack. I've imposed on @JamesLiamCook for now
@danprimack @BenedictEvans love the generous spirit ! but don't want to impose upon you (yet); might come back if I'm still stuck in 1h ;)
@BenedictEvans hah, I very nearly pinged you for this favour (@danprimack too) as you're obviously "up" :)
using twitter to find out who (locally/in London) is still awake... damn those scheduled tweets
rare but special to see both @StefanGlaenzer and @robertdighero smiling (esp when the former is giving a speech) 
...always fashionably late (fashionable somehow anyway) 
&lt;3 founder love @passioncapital 
@JamesLiamCook what prompted you to revisit?

But are the messages in Scarlett Johannson's voice? #Her 
@dominiccampbell @merici oh no, hope all better there? 5:45 is when my little man roused me out of bed too (long morning!)
@MichaelRaibin aw, hope your little man is feeling better. mine is petitioning (not unreasonably) for a day off school

@ted_hardy @JamesLiamCook @WarrenGuy @cmogle I see 1,060 now
@scale_investors thank you!
wrt to last tweet (sry to doubt UK voters) "YouTube Vids Get Exactly 301 Views" 
@WarrenGuy how long?
@WarrenGuy @JamesLiamCook so when does counter get ticking again??
@JamesLiamCook eh?? for real??? crikey where have I been (that's always youtube? for everything?) by contrast POTUS WHCD racks up views?
10 days to #GE2015 and this @David_Cameron speech (all fired up) has only 301 views?? uk voters don't engage online?

@AndyWilliams81 @danieleinlondon phew, thanks for the support! I went all-in and opted for a double cone 
I seem to be physically incapable of walking through Leicester Square without stopping at Haagen Dazs for ice cream 

But oh, the money. 


@ItsDUHnise @swml83 @lyn__sea @bekovert = 
@ItsDUHnise @swml83 @lyn__sea no, onyx black (battery life supposedly 1 day versus 2 weeks with @bekovert)
so apparently I'm not alone with my musical mid-life crisis... now if only I were still/just 42 yr old ;) 
@ItsDUHnise fyi, @swml83 @lyn__sea concur: feels way too plasticky and like a toy (thumbs down), kind of disappointing
@itsduhnise better/smaller form factor but (vested interest disclosure) looks+feels way inferior quality vs @bekovert 
@johndodds that's me... leading edge
@johndodds I don't expect any less (and am grateful for it; need to know I can always count on you)
@johndodds it's my (work) colour, reference @passioncapital
@JamesTaylor_me thanks James
thanks for having me! my slides (really) here 
@guy_levin ah sry, correcting now (thank you!)

@maxthelion ideology for ideological sake (without logic) is pretty dangerous or at least worrisome
@maxthelion side bar: why are you tweeting during extra time??

@kaigani @stevekennedyuk so his friends did try to help, ie they jumped in/were also in the water but couldn't pull him out?
@kaigani @stevekennedyuk anyone explain why not [police not go into the water]? why no bystanders when they first saw him "in difficulty"?
@benmoore82 sorry I didn't specify; was just before the 6 o'clock hour (back to bed for me!)
.@a16z new policy/reg affairs hire is genius. best proof ever they're backing true industry "disruptors" 
@ItsDUHnise I have one of those coming too (just confirmed shipping) but on spec alone this [size + battery life + features] is way ahead
@kaigani @stevekennedyuk don't know and is what I've been sadly wondering too. instead of calling 999 why not jump in (no current/tide etc)
@alexdunsdon @doug_scott @IvanMazour yes I have; quite the honour!!
@putt1ck early for me; happy catching (back to bed for me)!

office cleaner asked if I'm here late getting ready to go on vacation... little does she know this *is* my "vacation" (week of indulgence)
@benmoore82 such a good question. but it'd have to be (boringly) non-financial/work related and pertains to myself/personal life #underNDA

@andyy @sohear :D
@stevekennedyuk good point; perfect time to remind me of that /cc @joshr
@sohear @andyy omg if there has been any single recurring theme from my tweets (or based on time of day that I tweet) surely that's it!
@andyy it's not bad! (although a few too many chars surely?) ;)

@_sunilrawat @hkanji for sure, or consider Steve Jobs. I think question is whether or not they could've been even more successful... ?

@giorgeor lol, phew!
@stevekennedyuk @joshr in the last 1h?
@tzhongg oh yes, I used a couple of those with the same person for sure, eg SMS to voice :)
@DuaneJackson was thinking that... but actually not where first. instead where/how I last (most recently) communicated w/them (I think)
@johndodds oh yes those are all encoded with secret messages to different people (obviously)
no idea why I use diff channels to ping diff ppl. in last 1h I've used each of email, Twitter DM, FB messenger, Skype IM, Gchat, SMS + voice

@jyhsu I was particularly taken aback by fact that there were kids mocking me (if my kids did that to anyone...)
@putt1ck hah not an aggressive person. just surprised and then felt sorry for them all (told  kids' dad what they'd said since he missed it)
@Abhi_Times interesting re Montreal!
@drew :)
@drew if I'd had more chars I'd have tagged #thingsthatdonthappeninSF
today some kids laughed/mockingly said "konnichawa!" to me and then later some ppl asked me to seat them (thought I worked) at Dim-T #aiyah

@jasongoodman too too funny! see --&gt; 
@sohear for it being 11 years ago, it doesn't feel that long ago... :)
haha, Kaido Kärner just pointed out an old Skype album of his (2004) 
@StefanSchippers agreed; we're trending the right direction and making progress imho
@iRowan @magillett done (are you on board?!) ;)
@StefanSchippers I've been v lucky (and am old!) but predominantly male work environments have not held me back nor bothered me

@magillett @iRowan omg you have no idea. it is *the* book... there are stories you would not believe :) someone should still write it up

@rodolfor damn you, catch the hell up already!!!
@Ronin_Jim @guy_levin @adrianshort completely agree (as evidenced by all other tech hubs in the world)
@Dawid1 @davidjwbailey sorry, let me try again: ok tbh I only know b/c I expressly looked for them (was impressed when I thought memorised)
@dominiccampbell sentiments were all great (I really should NOT be such a downer), sorry!
@dominiccampbell sort of glossed over that ARPANET was first created for military use (quite opposite of "openness" to start)
@guy_levin @adrianshort sure she is/was... we also need a cure for cancer, and peace in the middle east (all over the world) would be nice
@dominiccampbell that bit made me think of N Korea tbh... slippery slope and just one person's pov imho

@stevegraham well if they did (do), their judgement is so fked up they'll fail eventually #naturalselection #darwinism
@stevegraham as you pointed out, you can't have a conversation about this key (2nd) point (reasons+solns) until/unless you establish the 1st
@stevegraham imho you're still not giving me reasons why getting co's to publish the data is a bad thing (agree it's no soln in/of itself)
@stevegraham well hopefully that's the first thing that gets established (voila, maybe there is no gap! fantastic and everybody's happy!)
@stevegraham troublemakers will always find something to pick on; we can't not try to move fwd w/transparency out of fear of their actions
@stevegraham adv effect how (don't hire women so you don't have to report or stay at 249 employees)? but I do wonder how to enforce/verify

@MultivaN83 no, being dishonest is not right, see my earlier tweet in the conversation: 
@cape love the #arsenalfc kit... my kids won't take theirs off for entire weekends !
@TheStalwart @GuyJohnsonTV 
@Ronin_Jim @DanielKorski agreed (x3)
@Ronin_Jim @DanielKorski still, it is v silly and only goes to show how very little the opposition has to grab on to and critique
@Ronin_Jim @DanielKorski call me naive but I think the issue people might have is the lying (outright denials) about it
@drew now listening to it on loop... that is some good shit and 1989 was a might fine year (aren't you too young to remember?!)

@StevanPopo or put another way, one's answer to that reflects firm DNA/ethos (which varies greatly from fund to fund, partner to partner)
@StevanPopo you are asking about level of importance of EQ for the funder or fundee? I'd guess answers are as varied as # of fund/firm types

@RossABailey brilliant; it's been too long!
@OliviaSterns @BloombergTV thanks Olivia; looking forward to seeing you!
@Doc_JP @OliviaSterns thank you!
@stevegraham would you vote for him?
@covert @MSmithsonPB nope, should I?
v handy for my current obsession w/British politics and #GE2015, seated next to @StephanShaxper CEO @yougov (poor him!) "so... wdyt of...?"
@zsims but def do say hi pls and I'll try to intro you if I can (and then if you gotta bounce, bounce)
@zsims honestly not sure how it's going to work (usually he doesn't turn up much beforehand but may stay after) tbh dunno yet
@malthe it's dark/low lighting! (you grab what you can)
@zsims yessir (although just to warn you: I've heard the panel might be lame)
no matter what one thinks of Boris he is def one of the best public speakers I've ever seen. fantastic jokes/delivery 
what happens when @mayoroflondon's speech gets dropped on the floor... ? (spoiler: he's still brilliant/on top form) 
OH (no joke, asked of me wrt group assembled of Barclays CEO, Anna Wintour and @mayoroflondon): "Is that Tim Luke?" 
more crucially than Anna Wintour, Victoria Beckham and any others who are here, @PruAshby warms up the press corps 
drinks and dinner w/@mayoroflondon @alexa_chung Anna Wintour and a few others hosted by @Derek_j_white Barclays 
absolutely blown away after meeting @kristentitus of @BilldeBlasio @nycgov team re Tech Talent Pipeline; need their playbook for UK/London

@OliviaSterns thru tomorrow and wld love to come on (didn't ping b/c I thought you'd surely already been pitched/harassed!) :)will email you
pleasure to join @MayorofLondon on another trade/business delegation; this time NYC (pictured w/@Tomc442 of Benoy)

@overdrev perfect; you always know just what to say MJ (I am now vertical). thank you
@Ronin_Jim hah if I were true/proper Chinese I'd have been out of bed hours ago (and def *not* moaning on twitter) ;)
ai-yah! too much to do to be sick

@craigdeakin @DanielKorski as w/previous events, opt-in list of nominees will be printed in the look book (ref 
@malthe obviously... (but later, after more sleep)

and now I will stop tweeting while feverish /cc @malthe
@eileentso @malthe weird @reply-fail, that was meant for you
@tandonshwetankk appreciate the interest! but event is to feature/showcase great examples of digital/tech from across the UK

wow, congrats to @pierrevalade and team! RT @TechCrunch: Microsoft acquires calendar app @Sunrise for $100 million+ 
@jermyap unrelated did you watch fresh off the boat? any good?
@jhong was it? Twitter seems to think so...
meanwhile, in other news: DayQuil is some seriously good (magical) shit. what's the UK equivalent?
.@robertdighero and @StefanGlaenzer are very amused that I've lost my voice/can't talk... surely helps our meetings wrap up more quickly!
@BreakwellNeil odd how much he was blinking for the first part of that... among other odd bits
@ElSatanico omg you know me too well... #heaven
@agit8or cool, but #1 is already ticked off, y/n?
@guy_levin @GeorgeBevis hahaha #nicetry
@guy_levin @GeorgeBevis dude, that's 3... :) you were supposed to only submit top 2
@charlottejee great to hear !
@GeorgeBevis @guy_levin lmao, come on now George... you've just shot your credibility! ;)
@charlottejee did he?
@guy_levin thanks for the RT. and what are your top 2? (same as to @georgebevis, not allowed to say all from your manifesto) ;)
@GeorgeBevis thanks for the RT, and so what would be your top 2? (not allowed to say all/everything in your document/digital manifesto) ;)
@MarkMWhelan what do you as an individual think should be a priority for ensuring the success of the country's digital economy... ?
quick survey (UK people): what would be your top 2 priorities for the UK Digital Economy in 2015 and/or 2020 (+5y)?
@farhanlalji thanks farhan; I'm sure I will... still have the DayQuil as backup ;)
when you really know you're sick/unwell = when @robertdighero tells you to go home #wedontbelieveinsickdays

@MKRocks or perhaps @msuster would be kind enough to connect us via email (please?) he and I briefly discussed last year when he was in Ldn
@MKRocks will you email (eileenburbidge at gmail) or lmk best contact for you pls? fwiw @passioncapital and recently 
@jpflintoff night
@MKRocks you should put some of that to work in the leading seed fund manager in London/Europe... !
agreed: MT @MattKamen: Fantastic comparison of #NHS &amp; private US healthcare:

@zsims ...happy now? (only b/c I'm still cracking up and you're right. lol re "future of tech" and @reply to himself)

@probablygeorge hahaha I love that last use case !
@Ronin_Jim nope. scrolled to see if it was a joke/reason for it, then looked/verified was PDF (ie intentional), then closed PDF reader :)
@sohear crikey, you don't know the half of it... ;) (almost as tough as journos'!)
@chuhnk nope
wow, just got a pitch (PDF 1 pager)... in comic sans
@Telegraph @Emmabarnett @SophyRidgeSky fwiw not uncommon 
@mikebutcher new entry @CylonLab fits that bill !
@Techmeme love the @cylonlab love (thank you!), but @techcrunch's @riptari was first to report on it... ~15h before this piece
let's compare anyway MT @May2015NS: Cameron has incomparably more FB supporters than Miliband…

@hkanji @Bloomberg don't forget yahoo and samsung too! (crazy week)

tech earnings week innit MT @katiehile: World Business Report's @mikejmedia speaks to @eileentso on @BBCWorldBiz about Facebook's results...
@bradwright unexpected! (was filmed for/aired already at 6) but I always love seeing @whitebearyard on telly
@ruskin147 thanks Rory (always means a lot coming from you) I wondered if they pinged me only b/c you were away/on holiday... !
@jamesjgill no apols needed (v much appreciate the tweet-love)
@jamesjgill hi James! was the piece filmed @whitebearyard much to the inconvenience of team @rolepoint ;)
@WilliamRea thanks v much Will; will relay the greeting for sure and hope you're doing well too!
@iaindodsworth haha, thanks but only if I could then choose my own walk-on music... like boxing
@RussShaw1 @marcduke thanks v much to both of you!
@katiehile thanks katie!
lots of fun today re AAPL @CylonLab 
ICYMI @myWickr released encrypted FB feature called "wtf" for photos/albums that last only 24h 
@DaleJMurray thanks Dale; always fun showing off @whitebearyard !
must admit I love this headline/subhead: "Invest in cybersecurity" and collaboration w/gov 
@andyy ohh @CylonLab is indeed very on-trend... ;)
@daniellenewnham that's too kind Danielle; I'm just lucky I happen to love what I get to do/work on every day !
@louisabojesen @CNBC thanks so much for having me on to talk @cylonlab !
piece will air just after 4 pm London time re @cylonlab launch and cybersecurity oppy for UK w/@CNBC's @louisabojesen 
@coletteballou thank you for a fabulous lunch (and food wasn't bad either)!
@tofdaj third time lucky...?
super excited for @CylonLab launch 
@tofdaj weird it did it again... I think twitter resolves it to .com automatically
@tofdaj obvs you're right (thank you!) total #facepalm/autocorrect esp since I was tight on # of chars
@bonq @marvin_mathew I def could not agree more. (still that's a crazy amount of money/could do so much). btw you gonna buy an iWatch?
@bonq yes but with 177 billion USD they could buy all the innovation (eg 480 of S&amp;P 500 or a gazillion startups). they can fk up for years
@bonq damn missed it (you're totally right, shoulda woulda coulda)... I'm just too fixated on them being a mountain of cash $$$
@JamesLiamCook can't quite tell if you're mocking me a la @rodolfor ;) (prob deserved) but did lead to fun convo re radio (input/output) etc
@rodolfor no but srsly afterwards he said "I didn't know you were going to be ON the radio" even tho ofc that's exactly what I told him :)
@rodolfor well obvs but one doesn't want to boast
@johndodds personally I'm just stunned at the quantum... the #s are just getting so big (like the US deficit) it becomes hard to relate to
@MarkLittlewood ;)
most fun bit of joining @BBC5Live Breakfast re AAPL was doing it in midst of school run. gave 8yo one of my earbuds so he was plugged in too
@moni_gi thanks Monika! just quick at gleaning the fountain of Twitter ;)
@PJWilkinson *when
@PJWilkinson DARN IT! I kid you not if I'd seen this b4 I went on air I'd have said it for sure (prob wwhen contrasting to Exxon) for real!
thanks for having me on; tough to effectively characterise AAPL magnitude! MT @AdamParsons1 Coming up- talking #apple w/@eileentso @bbc5live
@PJWilkinson haha, best you don't! at best I'll be sputtering, stammering and stumbling over "a ridiculously fk-load amount of cash..." ;)
will be @bbc5live Breakfast at 8:10 am... if I can pick my jaw off the floor and discuss those AAPL results w/o using expletives #speechless
@Abhi_Times I agree w/you but also am sort of giving up/conceding in trying to find holes in their strategy tbh :)
@Abhi_Times I would have thought so but amazing it's gone this far/accumulated to this degree already
@Abhi_Times I can't get over cash position
@rodolfor I must be getting too old. cannot parse. relieved I'm not doing any media  tomorrow; would not know what to say. crazy silly #s
@andrewgodwin add in a handgun maybe
just caught up with all the YHOO, BABA, AAPL news/results (too much for 1 day!) and it's staggering, esp AAPL. head explodingly staggering.
@EdGrapeNutZimm thanks v much sir; @donnafenn was most generous! and will do re visit @AngelVineVC @FirstGrowthVC
can't imagine this here MT @KateDavidson: @DunkinDonuts workers volunteered to work double shifts during blizzard 
@alex01 you going to run in the N Korea marathon?

@andrewgodwin maybe also draw a picture of your new house/flat as well?
@riptari v generous of you natasha (+ great write-up), thank you! but all credit to @alexvans  @jjluff @epsilonpartners @PoppyKWood &amp; Grace!
@dinamedland actually I just read my answer was re summer storms (hurricanes etc). but seems the weather channel "adopted" same for winter
@dinamedland @oditorium v good question and dunno tbh. I think v rare to get 26 per season so each new year "A" swaps male/female to start
.@myWickr launches encrypted Facebook feature; timed feed (named WTF) for photos that last only 24h 
@alexhern I got that last week from @adnanebrahim #painful 
@dinamedland they alternate male-female and down each letter of alphabet, ie next one will be male name starting w/letter "K"
loving the Baltics! (ASI was seed VC + now second Lithuanian acq'n): @Wahanda Acquires App Agency 
@lopo5 :D
@teller v true! however, @robertdighero was not in the office today so he's innocent (this time)
.@bisgovuk offices: rows of cubicles as far as the eye can see, literally to the horizon 
@putt1ck oh right,... er partners and collaborators?!
.@lopo5 haha, me too (US-style), but this was in reference to UK-variety/meaning of "muppets"
OH: "muppets, muppets, everywhere muppets"
@KumuthaRam @HanadiJabado @alexvans @CambridgeJBS fwiw my pov is startups *not* worried. even bear macro mkts can be good 4 them (eg hiring)
@maxwolflevy @SwiftKey completely agree! @thejonreynolds and team are a fantastic case/success story for the UK tech ecosystem
@bonq aha ok! in that case, phew ;)
@bonq sorry finished now! :)
@maxwolflevy haha, great point. I did think it was jolly good fun (didn't even have to turn on the telly!)
@daniellenewnham interesting. personally I was thinking of starting an online petition to get @edvaizey to do away with it
@inthecompanyof no discussion of "mass surveillance" but first audience Q was to Ed regarding PM's remarks (reported as re encrpytion etc)
.@Coadec @guy_levin that is a great pic! (thank you for co-hosting/moderating and v well done fitting in all twitter handles for that tweet)
@stellacreasy thanks so much Stella (def looking forward to more chats and work w/you, @chionwurah and colleagues!)
sitting b/t  2 opposing MPs (Ed and Stella) w/100 days to go #GE2015 was most fun I've had on a panel since the Wonga Q/VC panel #tcdisrupt
great panel w/@stellacreasy @edvaizey @gerardgrech @thejonreynolds @guy_levin but shame no photo of Ed sitting at my feet #bucketlistmiss
v reassuring recap of priorities for @edvaizey incl mobile, fintech, IoT, apprenticeships/edu and data/privacy (BCG mobile internet event)

@seikatsu hehe re trademark (it's a staging site!)
@alex gotcha; thank you for the recap! ps: I &lt;3 my surface pro!
@alex did he? if so and you tweeted sorry I missed it... what was the take-away re Surface sales/revs?
@stevekennedyuk haha, thanks! you like it? lmk if you want any changes... didn't take long at all (but I should pretend it took me HOURS)
@seikatsu haha I cheat and use @strikingly (which I &lt;3), see 
two websites (ok microsites (ok 1-pagers)) done... not bad for a Monday
@mbillings thanks for including @donnafenn's Q&amp;A with me in your "Daily Startup" today
@cimota haha, v good! but yes since headline is "52% of Britain's employees..." so therefore the other 48% employees...  must be ... ?
@DouglasCrets nice one
v impressed that 48% *not* unhappy w/salary ;) "52% Britain’s employees unhappy w/their salaries" (data by @adzuna) 
@jcap49 I think non-career politician good (although she has had unsuccessful political runs/campaigns in the past)
@jcap49 I think she prob is (scarily) a v good GOP candidate ;) she comes across as lacking any empathy (?!) fwiw I'm pro Hillary myself
@jcap49 wdyt of it? I was absolutely shocked, but do admire her ambition !
obvs: “The most effective way to criticize a woman is to have another woman do it.” @CarlyFiorina and @HillaryClinton 
wow. I totally missed that @CarlyFiorina is making a POTUS run MT @FortuneMPW Catch up on the news at the #Broadsheet 
@bonq oh good! when @StefanGlaenzer came back from #DLD15 he told us that was the best presentation he'd ever seen. I completely agree w/him
@chloegiard thanks chloe !
@bonq does that mean you liked it too?
@augieray I love my Surface! but didn't have wifi issues; maybe faulty/worth exchanging?

@torrauden glad you agree; I watched it twice myself (and paused a lot to take notes) ;) cc @StefanGlaenzer @profgalloway
@nerdgirl omg, seriously the whole not-revealing-his-identity thing... you're killing me! (I love this amazing adventure you are on!!)
@SarahRapp same to you! thanks again (hashtags too etc); realised y'day I didn't reply/thank you b/c think I was in bit of shock at first :)
@JudithREvans great piece! btw wrt UK companies (investing etc), thought you might find this of interest (16th Jan) 
@henrikberggren @profgalloway ah cool... I loved it (that had to be the most efficient use of 15 mins ever)
"only 3 things businesses work to appeal to and as you move down the torso margins get better" 
Apple has only tech product able to *expand* its margin over time (world's most powerful luxury brand) -@profgalloway 
FB+Google both have 2x as many "relationships" w/users vs Catholic church (quip "more than God &amp; on a mobile phone") 
@henrikberggren you should listen to/watch the vid (only 15 mins). gas station is @profgalloway's preferred option/prediction; makes sense
"best acquisition in tech: Instagram by FB; worst acq'n in tech: Tumblr by Y!" -@profgalloway 
@TufferB I completely agree. that's what I think every time I see it as a checkout option (totally befuddles me), but obvs working in France
.@profgalloway: "Amazon will make transformative bricks and mortar acq'n in bricks-n-mortar... b/c it has no choice" 
@profgalloway @StefanGlaenzer riveting and fascinating insights (sorry I'm spamming you now w/@mentions as I want to give you attribution!)
"smartphone economy is going to be outstanding for employment; terrible for wages" -@profgalloway #DLD15 
.@johndodds that's why I found the click-and-collect stat so fascinating (I don't "get" the concept and idea doesn't resonate w/me at all)
(btw I'm only 1/3 thru tweeting excerpts of @profgalloway's amazing #DLD15 talk 
in France there are 3000 drive-thru locations for click-and-collect (buy goods online; collect from physical location) up from 1000 1y ago
2/3 xmas shopping done on Amazon via free shipping (2x from 1y ago), ie not sustainable race to the bottom by Amazon 
more from @profgalloway "Amzn's achilles heel = shipping" shipping fee income $3.1bn, transport cost $6.6bn, +40% YoY 
e.g., "Warby Parker's [orig pure-play online only ecommerce] $3k sales per sq ft in retail stores second to Apple, ahead of Tiffany's in US"
fantastic (@stefanglaenzer was right): @profgalloway 900 secs 90 slides re The Four Horsemen: Amazon Apple FB Google 
"Chocolate [made] in Britain has a higher fat content [than same brand/product made in US]" 
@bonq :( MT @Yair_Rosenberg: A non-Jewish journalist dressed as a Jew and walked through Malmo. This is what happened

interesting: @Number10gov has just published its position/paper for an EU Digital Single Market (touches on a lot) 
loved talking w/@ManusCranny re my 2015 top 3 sectors: fintech, cyber/infosec, health/medtech

@mikebutcher @digitalshadows @GoCardless @Informilomedia they're in "promising" category w/Swiftkey, Nutmeg, etc (vs growth or under radar)

good luck w/that... RT @guardian: MPs urge Britain’s retailers to boycott Black Friday 
@IanMulvany @guy_levin @CityAM or more literally "to no effect", ie would not go so far as to ban/outlaw/force anything and is positioning
@LeoAnthias exactly! see now if you'd not sent that in my head I had definitely "over-interpreted" what "hey babe" meant/was referring to ;)
@LeoAnthias to be fair, it happens all the time. diff ppl would interpret "hey babe" lots of diff ways for example
.@guy_levin weighs it up for @CityAM "Cameron isn't trying to ban Snapchat, WhatsApp, iMessage &amp; encrypted messaging" 
@jjluff hilarious
@WarrenGuy I offer another paraphrase: "We want a back door/golden key" (different from banning encryption)
.@johndodds fair points, but I said "non-news" because it's literally not new. same mindset (good/bad/ick) that has been in place since 2009
@guy_levin @rodolfor @sohear totally agree/my point as well "diff b/t saying eg FB must be able to decrypt messages &amp; banning encryption"
.@rodolfor @sohear @guy_levin srsly I'm just glad (i) not banning crypto and (ii) not doing anything new until 2016... so therefore non-news
@rodolfor @sohear @guy_levin political effect could be the same, but tech/practical effect may not be b/c then there is regulation thereof..
@rodolfor @sohear @guy_levin mmmmmm; I think there are many layers but regardless "not banning crypto" &gt; "banning crypto" any day/my book
@sohear @guy_levin tbh not defending; just clarifying b/c v much relieved he did not suggest/mean to imply banning encryption (srsly right?)
@stevekennedyuk @guy_levin not as dumb as wanting to ban encryption though (all relative!)
clarification fr @Number10gov via @guy_levin: @David_Cameron's remarks != banning encryption in UK, just fwd view re DRIPA post-2016 sunset
@dinamedland omg amazing!! :)
