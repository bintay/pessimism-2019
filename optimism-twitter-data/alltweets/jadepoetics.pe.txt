@Pinky_Balboa <EYES> what are you making?
It ain't a race.  Stay in your lane.
fear debilitates. hope levitates.
you put things on layaway in hopes for being able to afford them later. things with no monetary value are actually priceless and worth it.
sometimes it is too late. we always think opportunity will return to us. the trouble is we always think we have time.
We live in our own soap operas, where we lie to ourselves daily and self-sabotage out of fear of the unknown. We cause our own anxiety.
When is it ever right to do something morally wrong?
I love our justifications for doing things we know serve us no purpose. We say things like we are only human or we only live once.
"You'll never have to sacrifice your dignity for your destiny."
If something is meant to be, it will be and you must remove all of that nonsense for it to be so.
You have to get sick of cancerous people in your life. The ones you love that are so toxic to your health &amp; happiness. And, separate.
Bury my words in your heart, I know you'll never search there.
My parents never participated in me being average or just good enough. It was not tolerated in my household.
My parents never congratulated me for second place. They made me practice harder.
You don't get rewarded for doing what you are suppose to do... You get rewarded for surpassing expectation.

"I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you."
"When we love, we always strive to become better. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too."
"People are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of."
"No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it."
"Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own."

I never wish bad on you, I just hope you learned a lesson.
Greatest revenge will always be personal success. Stop worrying about payback and just focus on growth and betterment.
Speak what you want into existence.
The greatness that's occurs when you let the past be the past and focus on the present.
Selfish people always end up lonely.
The crazy thing is people want all the forgiveness in the world, but can't forgive others when the time comes.
Don't wait until you lose everything to appreciate it.
The funniest has got to be when a man learns the error of his ways, but it's already a little to late to get back the girl he wants.
When villains play victim... 

Dude, you had a choice.
You should never get so angry you put your hands on someone, especially not a woman you claim to love.
Guilty conscience and a suspicious mind is a lethal combination.
It's so funny when someone accuses you of something they have been guilty of the whole time.

I miss @steph_smith123. She just fell asleep last night.
I'm hiding out in my car. I'm not stepping through those doors until 7:58.

@missTeee__ lmaoooo I would of never noticed. I went to Steph's page and saw you on hers. Are you coming for dinner tonight?
@missTeee__ Girl, you weren't going to tell me my stuck up self wasn't following you. <WEARY FACE>
the only way to break a bad habit is to replace it with a better one.

A flower no longer complains once it's petals have reached the glory of the sun. It dances with the wind &amp; has long forgotten it was a seed.
Don't shy away from the growth process. There are no shortcuts to teething. It is painful and inconvenient, but the reward is worth it.
Lord, I give you..me. If I could just press in your presence, hold the beauty of your face.
@Jcsw14 and every single day I mean it more. There are always more things to be grateful for than complain about.
You will run out of time before you run out of blessings. You will run out of life before you run out of love.
If you haven't told yourself this morning that you are beautiful, take the time right now to do so.

@TimeForAshley he's gone. hopefully, with a good family.
Be with someone who reminds you daily how magnificent you are.
I literally have to convince myself I'm beautiful every morning. I have long conversations with my mirror.

@steph_smith123 is an angel. I can't express this enough.

I hope you always hear my voice when I'm praying.
I hope you find some good in your morning. Some peace in your pieces. Some healing in your brokenness.
too many blessings to count.  
You will run out of time before you run out of blessings. You will run out of life before you run out of love.
Let me go collect myself. Something beautiful is happening. Peace of mind.
"Dysfunction is not love."
@QuincyWorld you're a real man.
Usually the reason is you're addicted to dysfunction.  
Invest in yourself.
Nourish seeds you want to grow. Tend to your garden, so it doesn't become a graveyard.
The things you produce are a reflection of you.
You are beautiful. You deserve beauty in your life.

@DiaryofAkuoma @NardiByNature let's make this happen!
@NardiByNature @DiaryofAkuoma you'll come too?
@DiaryofAkuoma I'm going to look up the tickets ! I have southwest cash from my canceled trip to California
@spencerthegypsy <EYES> I want to go there too!
Y'all don't want to know how many followers I've seen in real life that became amazing friends.
@spencerthegypsy Where do You live?
@iamslickrick_ negro, You said a minute!
@spencerthegypsy I need somewhere to go for Memorial Day and everyone says Vegas. I don't know anyone there. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@iamslickrick_ K...
@iamslickrick_ Mir is coming home <WEARY FACE> I'm going to text him. And I'm talking about for Memorial Day weekend.
@Alisha__Anne I have summer's off. I am planning to leave my comfort zone.
Who do I know in Vegas?
@Alisha__Anne I bought four bottles of wine yesterday and I don't even drink.
@_SydVicious_ I don't know anyone in Vegas
@iamslickrick_ let's go to Miami and visit Mir
wait, Memorial Day is coming up! I want to be ratchet in Miami. someone make this happen. I'm never ratchet. I deserve one weekend.
@Alisha__Anne because I go through it. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>  But, you knew that already!
@Alisha__Anne so I'm not really popping <PENSIVE FACE> damn.
@Bob_DeseApples I'm spending part of my summer in Atlanta <EYES><EYES><EYES>

@the_afroditee no problem, Goddess
@the_afroditee its a book by @AisforAlex
"If you were to line up a thousand men and ask them what they wanted in a woman, they would describe you."
"I am a woman every man is looking for. I have the qualities that every man wants in a wife, in the mother of his children.."
Know your worth. Too many women are filled with self-hatred, self-doubt, insecurity ..that we try to mend broken men when we are not healed.
So, my next tweets are all from our conversation.
@pgoodiezz just spoke a sermon to me. I took notes.

Listen to your parents. They speak because they know all the things not to do.
@Jcsw14 @steph_smith123 she is amazing.
God blesses those who bless others.
@steph_smith123 made me a smoothie for breakfast, packed my lunch, and made me eat last night. she is the perfect mom/best friend.
pray through it. meditate through it. read through it.
Too many amazing people in my life to not be thankful for life this morning.
I will run out of time before I ever run out of blessings. I will run out of life before I ever run out of love.
This Day One is so beautiful.
If you want to change your life, think better and you'll do better. 
When someone doesn't care about your safety, your wellbeing, your overall health... that someone doesn't deserve a place in your space.
Always have a rainy day fund. Always.
I woke up this morning bruised, but not broken deciding I will never put myself in this situation again.

Stop making excuses for his excuses when he should just be excused.
She began to utter many buts and whys...thinking your reasoning was an actual reason to stay.
You don't need to give him permission to let you go.
Baby girl, you must remember who you were before him and ask yourself who you want to be after him.
She evaporated into fragments of herself laying her peace in him as he left her in smaller pieces to vague to recognize.
He kept hurting her, so she kept giving him more and more of her love and less and less of her self-worth.
She couldn't understand how she could be so good to someone who was so cruel to her, but she thought she could love him through it.
That gut wrenching heartbreak that seems to demolish every ounce of hope and love and life from your flesh. You turn cold.
She called me. I listened. I could hear the tears flooding her eyes through the shortness of her breath. She was heartbroken.
because you needed to hear this. 
"Love isn't supposed to hurt us; it's meant to heal. You're worthy of the real thing. Find that mutual respect..adoration will follow suit."
"Everything isn't meant to be yours and everyone isn't worthy enough to hold a place in your space."
Just go buy @AisforAlex books so I can stop RTing her greatness.
"I've been hurt so bad and I still love so hard. I admire my heart for that."
Raise your children. 
"Dysfunction isn't love." -@AisforAlex 
@thaRoamingsoul <UNAMUSED FACE> nope.
this some bullshit. You Don't Have to touch fire to know that shit is HOT. 
Trust me, you will forgive him for his ain't shitness, but the moment it gets a little too hard... you'll see through the bullshit.
Let them call you whatever they want. You know your name. You don't have to answer. Where you are headed, they ain't welcomed.
Where are all our standards? Have we succumb to the ain't shitness?
Look, if you aren't his wife... there are conditions to your relationship and if he is doing this early on... it only gets worse later.
I'm sick and exhausted of women feeling stuck like they have to save some broken, selfish bastard of a man. You can't raise a man.
I mean you could be like me... You could choose to stay like I did. Repeatedly and enable it. I hope it works out for you. It didn't for me.
We are too young, too talented, and too beautiful to settle at any point in our lives for a man who thinks it is manly to have many.
..and don't you dare ever be so pitiful to beg a man to see your greatness. if he doesn't see it, something is wrong with his eyes, not you.
Are you in a relationship where you are on again off again? Look, just stay off until y'all can be adults and face your problems.
The right person is going to bring out the light in you and diminish the darkness.
If you are more focused on your insecurity than your greatness, you are with the wrong person.
It ain't worth it. The insecurity, the constant fear, the paranoia...ain't worth it for no man.
Let me just say something. LEAVE! leave any unhealthy situation. Leave it because it is detrimental to your sanity and success.
So, I got this DM and I can't tell you the amount of times a woman who knows my story has told me something like this 
It's not a burden if you know how to carry it.
God made me unbreakable.
I promise you one day it will stop hurting. You will move on from this. Laugh about this and appreciate the lesson learned.
one man's trash is another man's treasure 
You can't only love her when she is blossoming. You must love her when she wilts. For she will bloom again.

@Jcsw14 then you have to make up a thousand lies to cover that one up
@ZeeNTheCity grrrrrrr... when I go home... I'm going to twitpic
@kaymrf that's because you're a goddess. superhuman. queen. you can have all my babies for me.
I just used the word thot. I'm done with life. Hate Twitter.
@ZeeNTheCity how do I dress? is this a non-Thot summer dress affair?
@UPTMillz @ZeeNTheCity she is always out of town! I go to close places like NYC and Philly and ATL.
@ZeeNTheCity POV? I swear talking to you on Twitter, I have to decode your messages.
@UPTMillz @ZeeNTheCity oh.... zee, we met up at Founding Farmers! when we going to brunch again? stop holding out on me!
@ZeeNTheCity @UPTMillz what's a tweet up?
whether it's forever or just a moment, 
find peace in where you land.
be a healthy love exchange.
@Jcsw14 but you have a higher mental capacity &amp; understanding than most men. I think you're winning. Your Queen is just in her prep period.
@TheHH2O all the time
@Jcsw14 @lilhoneyydip they always win!
@McShann_Bitch get me back to this and I'll be your personal chef. That was a year ago. 
I can't wait to straighten my hair. I ain't ever going natural. Ever.
@steph_smith123 lmaoooo I really look like that doll 
@Jcsw14 in my head, most women are like this.
@steph_smith123 you called me a troll cause I'm tiny with a big head and my hair was crazy curly the last time you saw me. I peep it! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@Jcsw14 no, you can't have them. they're mine!
@Jcsw14 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> and they all work and cook and all that.
You are like mother teresa. You're an alien.  
Yes, but in my defense... I got really beautiful friends. It's kind of not fair. 
I worry about women who say they don't have any girlfriends at all like not even one.
When everything around is failing and you turn to see these Goddess shielding you... you just feel blessed.
I need to get all the beautiful women in my life together and celebrate their awesomeness. Jesus, I'm blessed.
@pgoodiezz @steph_smith123 @DiaryofAkuoma @Tara_Alexandra_ just some beautiful souls who are just always there when I need them.
@steph_smith123 is sincerely one of those people you have to have in your corner.
@McShann_Bitch that was a beautiful day. thanks to @steph_smith123. Beautiful souls like hers attract amazing people.
@McShann_Bitch girl... I need you to be my personal trainer and show me your body every time I want to give up and ill feed you!
@McShann_Bitch aww you make me so happy!
@Jcsw14 @Tara_Alexandra_ lmao... you don't even know what my food taste like! Tara, an expert!
@McShann_Bitch Shannon! Baby! It is a must. I'll make whatever you want this time! unless you really loved the empanadas!
@UPTMillz I don't even like typing out recipes. I'll send it to you again.
I'm not crazy.
I do so much because y'all don't do enough. I am not crazy.  
If only I wasn't so damn sick. Between this fever and this migraine and congestion. Man, feels like I'm falling apart.
I'm going to get my hair cut today. I'm very excited.
@Jcsw14 @DaddyANML y'all horrible people.
@Tara_Alexandra_ I haven't cooked for you in such a long time <WEARY FACE> I'm sorry.
@UPTMillz negro... bye. <UNAMUSED FACE> I ain't sending you anymore recipes! none. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@DaddyANML yes... I only buy dresses that fit my shape.
I just cannot. 
@UPTMillz you're* and yes... mad judgement.. you got the pancake recipe I sent you?
cooking is such a beautiful thing. I get high off of watching people eat my food. I'm a creep like that.
@UPTMillz it's not like the pudding your thinking of and you're a cook. you shouldn't knock something you never had.
Bread pudding is so bomb! my mummy's bread pudding is one of her best sellers at her restaurant.  
I wasn't the problem, but I enabled the addiction. That's why you never got clean.
Don't wait for someone to value you. You value you.
Self-Worth. A constant struggle for me.
@Jcsw14 you aren't wrong.
@Jcsw14 *kicks you... you would be the one.
I don't think our generation was crafted for things to last. We are all about upgrades. Quick, Fast, and Easy. What happened to longevity?
Your mistakes are not your defining moments unless you let them be.
You are going to make lots of mistakes in life. Sometimes develop a lot of bad habits. You just have to be able to push through it.
When people say this, but don't really mean it. Everyone talks nice until it's time to practice what you preach.

Don't ever forget where you love from. 
You too are a miracle that great bodies of water and the petals of orchids should envy.

Thank God for @steph_smith123 Every Damn Day.
Your idea of fun changes with age just like it should change when you get into a relationship.
...the rarity of this generations ability to care for the things they claim to love and value.
You can see someone's character by how they take care of things they love.

@NerdAtCoolTable <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Jcsw14 but, it doesn't matter.
And if you could say "huh"... you can hear.
but, men get mad at nagging, but give you reasons to nag like why do I have to repeat myself for you to answer?
...and why when I say dinner is ready... why aren't you immediately rushing to come eat it?
When I say dinner is ready, that means come right now.
You know what makes me mad? When I say dinner is ready and no one comes to eat... like that's the most frustrating thing.
..my excuse any time a man is made at me is "but, I made you dinner..."
like for why can't you just let me love you and occasionally nag you about things that would help benefit you?
finding a man that lets you love him is like finding a unicorn.
the generation that does things to post it on social media. rather show off than show up.

@steph_smith123 I volunteer as tribute.
@CourtneeHendrix oh. *leaves Mentions
@CourtneeHendrix -_- what ?
@moniquenashaye what's up boo?
No Matter the Circumstances, 

Greet this Morning with Love in your Heart!
my first time seeing this in person.

@FakeCare @RandPaul Maybe you should read that article I just read
Maybe we wouldn't have lack of fathers if ... let me just have have a seat.
A country founded on thievery, slavery, and corruption wants to say "Lack of Fathers" is the problem? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>

@Alisha__Anne I'm still a work in progress.
You know your patience has grown when you are calm in traffic.
Emotions tell us what we are thinking. If you want to feel better, think better.
Greet this morning with love in your heart!
We care more about what people do oppose to who they are.
Who are you when no one is watching?
I think this world is so focused on what we appear to be and not what we actually are.
uhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 
Stop sparring with complacency.
thoughts become actions. think better, live better.
If you keep the same bad habits, why would anyone give you more? That's how instant millionaires get broke so fast.
You will run out of time before you run out of blessings. You will run out of life before you run out of love.
Gratification is a key way to getting more and keeping it.
You get out of life what you put in. Instant gratification goes away in the same instant it came.

"The moment you understand the importance of loving yourself, you stop hurting others."
I forgive myself. 
I'm so happy. I want to do the Carlton.

God is working. God ....is working.
Some days... I sound like a fortune cookie.
I need to start doing yoga. I think it would be good for my body, mind, and soul.
I'm not strong enough for parasites yet... People with negative energy. One day, I'll be able to host them without them consuming me.
Surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you.
I think that's why I'm so happy. I gave them love and they amplified it back into me.
I spent the day around people with amazing hearts who just filled me with love and light. Most of all, serenity and inspiration.
<DISAPPOINTED FACE> I have to be writing for that to happen. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>  
Be a garden. Not a graveyard. Uproot anything that doesn't belong.
Just keep mind that a flower no longer complains once it reaches the glory of the sunlight and touches her warmth for itself. nurture seeds.
Growing up is a process.
Even as I go through this pruning process... I remember that I haven't reached the height of my existence.
I remember times when I didn't believe. I gave my failures easy victories.
Evil doesn't actually exist. Evil just means without God.
Like you may not believe in a God, but God is there. Your disbelief will not weaken the existence of the higher being.
I just want people to meet me and see God in me as well as the flaws of humanity.
"We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still."
Imagine if we lived in a world where fear and hope didn't combat. Love is what transcends that ongoing war.
That doesn't mean you won't have moments of great doubt and failure, but persistence.
We are always looking for a shortcut, but sometimes shortcuts aren't so short.
Sometimes...we have to re-break bones in order to have it set right.. that means going through more pain to make it better.
We have to stop using band aids on open and bleeding wounds. We have to learn to disinfect and stop the blood.
Sometimes, you have to hit rock bottom to know you can only go up from here.
If only we saw our failures as an opportunity to get it right... to be beautiful.. to go through our ugly duckling phases.
See, everything bad that has ever happened...something good and better reacts to it.
We often say why me when bad things happen to us instead of why not me...
Wish good on everyone! Every single person! Everybody!
You're the Marley to my reggae.
The answer has and always will be to love. Love is my religion.
Meditation. Prayer. Reading. Good Food. Great laughs. Build new memories in old places. That's how you truly get over a break up.
Happiest people in the world focus on the solution, not the problem..It's not that they don't have bad days, they just find the good in them
Pain has never been much of a motivator for me. When it's gone, what's going to motivate you?
We love numbing the pain. Any slight annoyance, we mute it, block it, medicate it.
I do that. Make myself so busy and exhausted to avoid the loudness of my own thoughts and pain.
Busy isn't going to solve it. It will crash when you hold still long enough.  
Too busy trying to keep memories oppose to make them.
We get so caught up in capturing the moment, we forget to enjoy it.
I think solitude is very important. You need that moment to just separate yourself from everything you identify with. Silence your thoughts.
Man, what! tea will also cure a bloodshot wound, gangrene, and help you find a husband. 
You leave my home happy and fed.
I cooked so much food today for just four people.
She is beautiful! damn it! 
hangovers that bad?

@RegalRobynn @steph_smith123 awww thanks. I tried something different with my hair. <WEARY FACE>
@steph_smith123 @RegalRobynn <UNAMUSED FACE> she made me buy a dress
@Iszabelle__ that's not love. love makes you want to live.
@deesseNoni I thought I looked ugly so I deleted it
@BriannaAmor face beautiful*
Happy Birthday to @steph_smith123 .. She is an amazing mother, a beautiful woman, a wonderful friend. Let God continue to guide her!
I've been on Twitter too long. I said, Bae.
when you want "bae" to feed you. 
<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
Why y'all don't like sharing food?
@NoWomanIsRight im good! How are you?
@NoWomanIsRight hiiiiiiiiiii
lmaoooooooo 
your boo loves you when he lets you eat off his plate even though y'all ordered similar things.
your boo loves you when he massages your scalp with argan and coconut oil.
your boo loves you when he brings you Chinese food at the hair salon while you're under the dryer.
@UPTMillz of course... but my pancakes too bomb. I make a reduction sauce with them!
@Titty_expert he the bomb. he secretly trying to tell me I'm getting fat and to check it.
what..... 
@deesseNoni pancakes are yummy
@UPTMillz oh, they are saying pancakes aren't enough food.
wait, are they saying pancakes ain't enough? have you had my pancakes? like excuse me... my blueberry pancakes are bomb.
@UPTMillz man exactly...
...anything to agree with the timeline. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> I just cannot.
why wouldn't a man be hungry after sex? I'm so confused here...
y'all do marathons every time y'all have sex?
is pancakes code for something else?
so, now eating after sex makes you childish and means the sex wasn't good?
This is why twitter and I don't agree.  
I haven't learned how to keep my peace, so until then... I have to limit my interactions with people who disrupt it.
the people you are around, should make you better.
We have to stop bringing dead things back to life. Some things, we have to learn to let go or it will go rotten.
If they don't inspire you, challenge you, motivate you, and highlight your awesomeness...chances are they ain't the one.
@tiaramvrie man, I was hoping you found the one.
I'm going to find some one day. 

i pray no man is bold enough to talk himself into your life and have the audacity to convince you t…
@UPTMillz it's so good! I love all three. if you make the sauce with honey Dijon, BBQ, and pineapple juice it's like amazing
@UPTMillz jerk garlic BBQ
greet this morning with love in your heart,
@PaulTheEsquire he was!
@cholosNcocaine he trying to tell me to get back to my best <WEARY FACE> I'm working on it. Love you boo!

@rachhBeEasy @Iszabelle__ @Jcsw14 I'm saying my dumbass would stay and I understand why she did. shit.
@Jcsw14 Of course, it is her fault too. Self-Love. Self-Worth. Self-Respect. Most learn through experience. I'm the perfect example.
I'll pancake you with my fat ass if you even try! 
@Jcsw14 I never said that. Ever.
We got all the answers on Twitter until it's time to apply it.
*exits this conversation. You are blaming the abuse for loving the abuser oppose to the abuser. 
@Iszabelle__ @rachhBeEasy @Jcsw14 I don't have enough characters for this conversation. In a perfect world, we wouldn't make mistakes.
@steph_smith123 Girl... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> I'm fat. I cried all the way home.
"When you're with someone that doesn't care about you, you stop caring too."

This why Rach the ish! 
@steph_smith123 Girl, I know you're my friend, but can we not lie here...
... 
@steph_smith123 as are you <FACE THROWING A KISS>
We just aren't going to discuss why I'm fat now.
When I'm not happy, I gain a massive amount of weight.
exactly.  
When a person is happy, genuinely happy in a relationship... Health becomes part of that relationship.
Because he destroyed her self-esteem.  
When you stop taking care of yourself, you are probably in a bad relationship.
-_- I just can't right now.  
@EricWilliamsYO fair assessment, but it holds no one accountable for their actions or part of the destruction.
@Jcsw14 lmaoooo I'm dead.
@goulding_jr <WEARY FACE> I guess
@Jcsw14 hmmmm
@Jcsw14 <UNAMUSED FACE>
Find me a crazy and insecure woman and I'm almost certain I'll find a man who had some part in that.
...any man you know ever say, "Babe, I understand" and actually mean it?
Men forever stating how crazy their girlfriends are, but skip over all the things they did that made her that way. How does that work?
@Jcsw14 lmao I don't think you try to be funny. I think you're actually occasionally funny.
I'm going to stop being petty as soon as I learn to take my own advice.
@UTxJGTheDon don't judge me
Men who try to be funny worse than a woman trying to be cute.
Arrogance is such an unattractive trait to me.
No more standing in my own way.
"Follow your bliss." -Joseph Campbell
...knowledge isn't power. it is the utilization of such knowledge that yields power.
Your current situation is made up of all your past thoughts. You want to transform your future...change your thinking now.
The trouble is we don't use our mind, it uses us. We've succumb to the negativity that we unconsciously that we perpetuate it.
Most things are all in your mind. Thinking can be toxic if you allow it to be so.
I will run out of time before I run out of blessings. I will run out of life before I run out of love.
all my limbs work. 
You are what you think you are.
Greet this morning with love in your heart.
Self-Reflection is always a real pruning process for me.
Never realized how much I utterly hate myself. Been searching for things externally and nothing is there.
"Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud."
She drowns in the insecurities you pushed her in. Eventually, she'll learn to swim.
People lack self-love most of all, so how can any expect a world of love when we treat ourselves so bad...
You want to be loved by everyone and forgot to love yourself.
"How long until we get it right? I know we can do it. All we need is love. Love is the resolution."
...the older you get, the less you want money and the more you want peace. you begin to see what matters. what resonates.
You can't allow this world to crumble your spirit. It's too physical and baby, you are all soul.
Resentment is one hell of a poison.
I just want to be better than I talk, but I got to be quick to listen and slow to speak first.
even Midas realized he no longer wanted the golden touch.
We are always looking for someone to stimulate us. We treat people like gadgets. Disposable. Easily accessible. We like to upgrade.
Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom and lose everything to realize what we really want or get everything and realize it doesn't satisfy us.
You work harder for your money than your relationships with people.
The microwave generation where everything is quick, fast, and easy.. but usually last less time and always has less substance.
Things are quicker to destroy than create.
Trust has to be one of the hardest and most difficult things to rebuild.
The boy who cried wolf is the perfect childhood story. Eventually, when you start to tell the truth....No one believes you.
if you need to appear single, you should just be single.

...a Queen is celebrated daily. Find a man who celebrates you.
...the person you love shouldn't be a secret. you shouldn't be ashamed. your love should be celebrated.
@MyFreedom21 @lovethediosa We know this.
my Afro was the bomb!
Big Up to my Chinese-Jamaican Granddad for marrying my Goddess of a grandmother and allowing them to make me! 
@lovethediosa yey... as am I.
@lovethediosa fair enough. I still think we all came from Kings and Queens though <SLEEPY FACE>
@lovethediosa me too! I love you more.
My White Jamaican Dad (Original) @lovethediosa  
Jamaica's Motto is Out of Many... One People.
@lovethediosa and if my Chinese-Jamaican cousin can get locs... then a White Jamaican should be able too.
@lovethediosa I always understand and agree with the things you say, but fake locs for any race is a weird trend.
@lovethediosa fair assessment.
@lovethediosa I was just defending the blonde girl with dreads because I didn't see anything wrong with it.
@lovethediosa in the East Coast, I think that it's a trend especially here in D.C. Everyone got them now. I love it... but
@lovethediosa I only know up to my great grandparents, but Jamaican-Blacks still slaves. Can't trace my roots to the motherland either.
@lovethediosa never thought that, but I still think it's a trend.
@lovethediosa and I think the same for some Whites. Growing up in the city, they weren't textbook. They understood to the degree they could.
@lovethediosa I don't see it that way for most Blacks that have fake locs. I get it but I don't see it.
@lovethediosa I'm Black -_-
@lovethediosa yes, I didn't agree with the first part. not the latter. My bad.
@lovethediosa I get this. but I also see Blacks do this as a trend and my Jamaican family sees it as disrespectful.
@lovethediosa I understand this.
@lovethediosa but, although every Caucasian is considered privilege, every Caucasian is not racist or doing it to mock our culture.
@lovethediosa I don't think this is true at all. But, we can agree to disagree.
@lovethediosa agree with everything you said and completely get that. I personally don't think it's wrong to admire a culture by doing that.
@ILikeTheOCup So, what is a word for Blacks who believe that all members of their race are superior to any other race
@SirSpliff_ yeah... there is an old song. "Them a bleach, Them a bleach out there skin to look like a brown'ing." 
@ILikeTheOCup I love that quote/definition  too, so I'll find a new word for it. You've persuaded me enough.
@SirSpliff_ Jamaica has a HUGE bleaching problem. Huge.
You want to teach your students, your kids that race doesn't matter and then, end up teaching them sometimes it does.
@ILikeTheOCup I love this, but by definition alone this statement is discredited. 
Maybe y'all aren't aware of Jamaica's bleaching problem.
@urkle9 I disagree as I watched my Full-Chinese Jamaican grandfather and Full-Indian Jamaican grandmother marry Full-Black Jamaicans.
side note: not that locs started in Jamaica. just made it prominent.
The oppressed can't oppress? I've seen too many exceptions to that rule to believe that statement in its entirety.
Look at the maternity ward of segregation known at your minority public school.
The aftereffects of slavery is still pregnant &amp; bearing. Swollen feet &amp; craving with new generations of Jim Crows.
Quick to call anyone who doesn't disagree a racist or prejudice or tell them not today instead of listen and inform.
But, as a teacher and student... As a race, we want to pick what to support and what to despise ourselves.
Before you slander me, please remember I write Black Empowerment pieces all the time. I understand the importance of Black Lives.
When we all know the difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality along with racism and prejudice. Then, human social construct.
@CSanders937 I'm Jamaican and Jamaicans don't understand why people wear them as a fashion statement.
Listen to one Bob Marley song and think y'all Jamaican, but don't even know there is a big population of Chinese Jamaicans.
First of all, half of all with locks know not a damn thing about Jamaican culture and wear it as a style. So, y'all need to have a seat.
If a Black woman can wear Blonde weave, why can't a White woman wear dreadlocks if she admires the culture and style?
@prayingforgems they shouldn't be mad though.
I consider myself Black and educated. I disagree that Blacks can't be racist.
Maybe y'all never met a racist Black person, but I have.
@prayingforgems @Trendy_FLACKO @FLEXIN3X I'm not saying Blacks aren't oppressed. I'm just saying that Blacks can be racist by definition.
@Trendy_FLACKO @prayingforgems @FLEXIN3X incorrect. what you are talking about is prejudice. racism is the belief of superiority.
Just because Blacks are oppressed does not mean that some don't believe they are the superior race. Therefore, they can be racist.
If ANY race believes they are better than any other race that means they are racist.
this is incorrect. let me explain why.  
Judging someone by the color of their skin is racism. No matter if you are black, white, yellow, purple, orange.
@prayingforgems @FLEXIN3X People have to understand racism goes both ways no matter how deep rooted or justifications for not liking another
@prayingforgems @FLEXIN3X not Black slander at all.
I will run out of time before I ever run out of blessings. I will run out of life before I ever run out of love.
Greet this morning with love in your heart!

Learn as much as you can.
Love unconditionally.
I eat because I'm sad and I'm sad because I eat.
@NoWomanIsRight <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> God put me on this earth to praise him and I praise through eating!
God humbles me when I start feeling myself. He curses me with fat so I can remember the struggle.
@NoWomanIsRight what? food is so good to the soul.
When they tell me how many calories something has in it... 
I'll spend money on eating well over looking well any day.
When I think about getting a weave or buying nice things, I think about my bills and bills always win except when it comes to food.
Exhibit A - I wait till the last possible minute to do my grad school work and still get an A.
I procrastinate in everything I do because I know I can get it done.
at least my fat spreads evenly throughout my body, but it's getting hot out and I need to get in the gym. I'm a procrastinator in life.
@Bob_DeseApples You should of told me only Beyoncé could be Beyoncé.
Damn you women who can eat whatever you want and not gain a pound. Damn all of you! (more power to you tho, you're blessed)
I gained 5 pounds in Atlanta. Steph birthday on Friday. I have to lose ten pounds in a week. It's about to be very unhealthy <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@Bob_DeseApples told me not to dye my hair! she said it would fall out.
I'd never dye my hair blonde. Ever. Never.
@ZeeNTheCity it's not growing. I'm convinced it's been the same length for a year.
When I tell you my hair was orange and within the next weeks just started falling out relentlessly. Man, what?
I wanted to have hair like Beyoncé so I brought a picture of a her and my hair dresser was like you know that's weave. I told her to do it.
@TanairLG @Bob_DeseApples send me a hair growing system.
@5_D Yeah... I know different types now and the many ways to get them "installed" in your head.
@Bob_DeseApples @TanairLG yes, yes I do! I'd be fly with a weave!
I spent several hours researching weave. I want one. Before I leave Atlanta tomorrow, I'm going to have one.
@TanairLG @Bob_DeseApples I want one! send it my way.

...a flower never complains once it blossoms. all that struggle to reach the sun from a seed. it was use to darkness.
We can influence thought, but we can't choose for people. We can help them up and guide them, but we can't walk for them.
The best problem solvers fix issues before they have the time to collect more dilemmas.
We often spend time backtracking instead of moving forward..Too worried about what could have been changed, instead of changing what can now
life is too short to spend a day not loving or accepting.
@RegalRobynn Pride is never worth the guilt or a heavy heart.
Some people you have to love from a distance because you are too blinded by their potential to love them up close.
You are allotted to remove friends who's decisions are too painful to bear.
You realize how much you and your friend are in a relationship when you fight.
Arguing with friends are one of the most emotionally painful things.

@DiaryofAkuoma they tried to put me on the 8:30 flight. girl... I cried. I was like but there is one at 6:45.
They checking the plane. Security measures. I don't know what's going on.  
all of this is a learning experience. preparation.
Advertisements look appealing most of the time. You got to read them product reviews.
Twitter going to convince you of a lot of things if you let it. That's why you have to be weary of who you follow.
People grow at different speeds. Life isn't a race. Too many of us burn out too quick.
@Alisha__Anne Advice is free. If I knew then, what I knew now. I would of never went to college out of state. Never got an apt that quick.

@lovethediosa we are in the same boat
too often we blame circumstances oppose to our lack of preparation.
I threw a full-out, horrible, childish ... temper tantrum. crying and cursing and all that because I missed a flight. I'm embarrassed.
Life is 10% of what happens to you and 90% of how you react. What I've learned is that I have a poor reaction to things.
I think every experience is a lesson.
I came back to twitter to just tell you I missed my flight to ATL.

You lift your heavy foot and leave prints on concrete hearts holding homeless hostage searching for a place to place each night.
"Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret: The million other straws underneath it. Mathematics."
People so concerned about my reaction, but not realizing all the actions that occurred to get me here.
By the Grace of God.
You shouldn't have to lose something to know you would appreciate it, if it were gone.
You don't miss oxygen until you can't breathe.
someone will push you there so you get out of character to prove you're just like them. the truth is you are, but you exercise self-control.
Should of kept ignoring this nonsense like I have been for weeks.
They will call. They will show up. Plan trips. Whatever. They will do whatever it takes to get you back, but the change rarely is permanent.
all common sense just left my body. all of it.
Lucky for me. I write a lot of really good poems off this crap.

Dysfunction is not love.
@_yellow_paiges_ I take that back. I want to wake up and look like Paige too.
This cop who killed #WalterScott is what a thug really looks like. 


@ImNotLatina Paige is beautiful, but you are just as well. Different kind of beauties, both Queens.
I told my students segregation no longer existed. I lied. They then told me, "Look at our school." 
When your skin color is etched with an inscription that says, "Shoot first, Ask later."
one of my friends wrote this incredible poem about if she had half-Black children. it was so beautiful.
You want to tell your children race doesn't matter, but then you have to explain sometimes..a lot of times... it does.
Before I know the gender of my future child, I know he or she will Black and for that alone, I'm scared.
@_yellow_paiges_ you are stunning.
when my devotion is two for two in one day. 
Too many women willing to be doormats to prove their love. That isn't love. Love never stomps and tramples you with bullshit.
Of course, he is going to do the same thing if you enable him. Why should he change if you're still going to be there?
@Alisha__Anne Nope... they still think they are getting her back and still going to do the same thing. They haven't learned yet.
@MissAngelaDavis has a cookbook I could buy?
I should purchase some cookbooks, but I just cook. I need to look up some new recipes and make them my own.
@reginamariahh yessss !!!
Why do men think flowers fix anything? Flowers should be for celebrations, not apologies.
@Alisha__Anne "Sorry, I lost you flowers."
some of the best things to read. books you should definitely buy. 
"If you love a flower, you shouldn't pluck it from the ground."
I'm allergic to pollen. I was sneezing so bad.
but, tell me these flowers weren't just so beautiful. my students were reading my card and all up in my business. 
I'm like Belle. I want my house to have a grand library.
If you knew me better, you'd send me books and not flowers.
the books I bought to add my library in the last 2 weeks. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ 
Steph and I about to go on countless groupon dates.
@steph_smith123 I'll be in Atlanta next weekend <TIRED FACE>
@steph_smith123 @KrownRoyaleNY I think  I'm going to Philly for a day trip to perform. You should come!
I miss my boo ambie so much. She is all the way in Texas.
@KrownRoyaleNY @steph_smith123 lmaoooo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> steph...we need to take a better picture. ones like this. 
@steph_smith123 not as beautiful as yoh
@KrownRoyaleNY Lmaoooo I can't with you
my students are stressing through this test. like stressed out. 
@CallMeAyeJizzle Alex Elle poetry books.
@_alessiamariaa devotion.
my books come today <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I've bought seven new books in the last two weeks -_-
Not today, Devil. Nope. Not today. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
You are golden.
@TionnaLashay good morning, Queen.
"take my mind, take my soul, take my heart... never let me go..."
@steph_smith123 shared the story of her sister with me and y'all can't tell me miracles don't exist and prayer doesn't work.
I hope you believe in something greater than yourself that also happens to be inside yourself.
Let everything that has breath, praise.
"If I could just press in your presence, leave all my worries behind me. You call me your own, so I give you me. Everything."
I hope you always feel my voice when I'm praying.
"If I could just press in your presence, I will be whole, I'll still believe, I'll just lay at your feet. Right here...in your presence."
My devotions are always on point. That gold hummingbird bracelet I bought yesterday symbolized so much. 
I will run out of time before I ever run out of blessings. I will run out of life before I ever run out of love.
"I want to sing like birds sing ...Not worrying about who hears or what they think." -Rumi
@skyzoo you at 5 in morning.... can't wait till your new album drops 
"I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me."
@yusufyuie <UNAMUSED FACE> you will forever use sandpaper to dry my tearz.
dear self. 
I'm against dating friends. When it doesn't last, it usually gets messy.
@UTxJGTheDon I liked it.
@yusufyuie don't make me fall in love.
@Alisha__Anne I'm going to try it.
Fast 7 was everything I expected it to be.
"You're a kite dancing in the hurricane..."
@MrPryority It's okay.
@Alisha__Anne I want extensions. I keep cutting my hair and dyed it blonde and it was over from there.
play in my hair <WEARY FACE> 
@MrPryority Life isn't about reacting to impulse. A single breath can change everything.
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> this has some truth to it. 
He turned and said, "You're amazing. You're beautiful. You just don't know it yet. You're too native.."
@KrownRoyaleNY What? everybody in the friendzone. I'm too focused on my goals to be distracted by potential. I need kinetic. a movement.
@MrPryority I like satisfaction. Not instant gratification. It usually has guilt lingering.
@KrownRoyaleNY I'll be the dopest wife. All my male friends are in agreement minus my nagging. I can be the nag, but I make it up with meals
Giving into temptation is never worth the instant gratification.
When you are over something, you are just over it. Ain't nothing going to bring you back when you've given it up.

know that
@KrownRoyaleNY <WEARY FACE> I'm a good friend.
@KrownRoyaleNY you are ridiculous. can we be friends? just friends? I'm a great friend!
@KrownRoyaleNY lmaoooooo trust me, you don't want these damaged goods
A society more focused on what we look like, then who we actually are.
When you have to come at someone's physical appearance to make yourself feel better, just know looks can be altered. Personality, well...
...a Queen is celebrated daily.
You were so beautiful and then, you opened your mouth.
Look like what? Because I don't get it. Your looks should must your ugly attitude.  
@KrownRoyaleNY lmaoo don't do it. it was a joke.
speak it into existence. 
always.  
@KrownRoyaleNY do you promise to forsake all other Twitter honeys and broads and make me your wcw? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I made a funny. laugh at it!
I just can't today <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
@VictorPopeJr @BritBratAlexis I can't breathe
I hope you always feel my voice when I'm praying.
All the places you will see...
l bought this cute hummingbird bracelet at National Harbor. hummingbirds are associated with healing. 
But, today... I explored all the little shops. It was so awesome.
I'm so simple to make happy. Today, was just so magnificent. I lived by National Harbor for months and only visited once.
@Alisha__Anne next Sunday. on the 
18th or 19th... one of those days.
I have to say twitter has introduced me to some extraordinary women. Beautiful, Talented, Hardworking.
@Alisha__Anne I swear I'm not. We should do brunch when I get back from Atlanta or maybe dinner.
@Alisha__Anne thank you, Queen. when are we going to hang out?
today was peaceful. it was too beautiful to stay inside.
@KrownRoyaleNY lmaoooo.... You husband material yet?
@KrownRoyaleNY you know it!
@KrownRoyaleNY sureeeee.... my aunt owned that. my parents own a spot in jersey city.
@KrownRoyaleNY it was on Utica! How do you not know McKenzie's? It was like a West Indian landmark.
@KrownRoyaleNY have you ever been to McKenzie's?
"I know you've been going through some things. Wanna get away. Let me be your vacation. You know I just want to make you feel better."
create new memories in old places.
seeing national harbor with a new perspective. 
I can't believe Theo is really here.
@gregNEVERchills @KrownRoyaleNY I don't want love enough to sacrifice getting burnt.
@gregNEVERchills @KrownRoyaleNY negro, no. People who cook, don't cook naked.
@gregNEVERchills @KrownRoyaleNY <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> OMG you are just too much! I promise to stop judging him &amp; be an awesome friend to him &amp; cook for him
You have to remember when you are talking to one. You are talking to a thousand. I should of learned that lesson a long time ago.
@gregNEVERchills I'm not choosing at all. I'm choosing myself. I have to work on me. That's my focus. This got out of hand.
I'll play villain if you want me too I chose someone repeatedly after he disrespected me I wasn't a victim I made that choice I live with it
@gregNEVERchills Yes, but we make our own choices. I chose bad.
@KrownRoyaleNY @gregNEVERchills I like my routines. Let me be a square.
@KrownRoyaleNY @gregNEVERchills No, I want a man who grants me peace. Calmness. Clarity. Not confusion.
@gregNEVERchills I'm not against it. I'm just cautious of people and who they pretend to be online as well as in person.
@KrownRoyaleNY @gregNEVERchills both of yall distracting me from my damn grad school paper. got me all discombobulated.
@gregNEVERchills which is? what? that I shouldn't judge people off their tweets, but here you are judging me not knowing me either.
“@KrownRoyaleNY: These niggas will convert to any religion u want if you bad enough... #StayWoke” <UNAMUSED FACE>
@gregNEVERchills @KrownRoyaleNY you're a damn instigator!
@gregNEVERchills because you didn't know our history. see... you judged me. He asked about God one day and I said, if he wanted, I'd help
“@gregNEVERchills: So then u expressed that to him? @jadepoetics” read the whole conversation then, get at me 
@gregNEVERchills Okay... then, fine.. but I know what I'm interested in. He doesn't believe in God. That is something I heavily believe in.
@gregNEVERchills because he isn't ready nor am I. I'm in a healing process. Men like the idea of me.
@KrownRoyaleNY <WEARY FACE> oh gosh... I didn't mean it the way it came out. That was not my intention.
@gregNEVERchills he was blocked for a really long time if I'm not mistaken. he was trying to be funny. I didn't find it funny. he's grown.
@gregNEVERchills label me.. I could care less. I just know MY story and make MY decisions based on MY experience.
@gregNEVERchills judging my choices and not knowing my story is dumb.
@gregNEVERchills In the street, on twitter, whatever... it's about the approach. He use to be rude to me, but you don't know the back story.
@gregNEVERchills If a man approaches me correctly, it will be fine, but I've spoken to the man before and you don't know what contact we had
“@gregNEVERchills: lmao its mad funny. cause yall really giving niggas box cause they dont tweet like shitty niggas.” Uh my is box sealed.
@KrownRoyaleNY @gregNEVERchills here we go!
@gregNEVERchills I don't think they ever tell the whole story, but they show what a person CHOOSES to present.
“@gregNEVERchills: yall thinking like girls” protective women. why would I want a man who likes to put on a show?
@gregNEVERchills no, you didn't. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> I can't believe you.
@PrettyLabels when you tell me the secrets to your flawless skin <WEARY FACE> lol
@Tara_Alexandra_ he won't go to the Yankees Game <WEARY FACE> but this is better than the first game of the season
“@KrownRoyaleNY: Niggas on twitter love tryna holla at the chicks they think i want...” @ yourself
"I'm going to spend the rest of my life surprising you."
@Tara_Alexandra_ a friend from NY just called me and told me he is down the street. I'm in utter awe.
I have a love/hate thing with surprises, but this one caught me so off guard.
@MzMendoza <WEARY FACE> What I do?
@KrownRoyaleNY lmao..What did I tell you? You're in search of something I told you only God could provide. I'd be there when you were ready
a father's love is something magical. it's strange how it seems like a fairy tale to the students I teach..the way they yearn for their dads
@KrownRoyaleNY that part is what you want Twitter to see of you. I'm not entertained. I've been there. Done that.
FaceTime with my papa and brother this morning. Miss the first men that I've ever longed.
@KrownRoyaleNY your tweets say it all.
@KrownRoyaleNY when you're ready to love.
@cholosNcocaine I didn't know she could stay still so long
@KrownRoyaleNY <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> hi.
I meditated with my three year old cousin this morning. She keeps saying breathe out, breathe in. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
I will run out of time before I ever run out of blessings. I will run out of life before I ever run out of love.
that jog this morning gave me life.
@ImSuperDope_ <WEARY FACE> and I got this new poem... Let me see what I can do.
@YoDraBeats I have no reason too.
@ImSuperDope_ #liestoldontwitter but to be wanted is nice.
"Each moment is a place you've never been."
must awake from this bed and go for a run. must do it now. must.
@YoDraBeats Lmaooo I don't curve anymore.
@ImSuperDope_ If I cancel my exam, I'll go to Philly on Sunday.
I morphed into whatever you needed me to be ....whenever you needed me to be it. Everything except for myself. Never again.
@YoDraBeats man, me in that Dress would be so unstoppable.
@steph_smith123 we can make that happen. I'm not sure the hotel would allow all those balloons <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@YoDraBeats @Khits_OT I need that dress.
The way a woman can morph for a man and become everything he needs and nothing he actually wants.
@Tara_Alexandra_ I think so. Let me go wake some people up!
@Tara_Alexandra_ love them. just had to change cause it wasn't deemed attractive by the person I was with, so now... things are different.
@Tara_Alexandra_ always the Yankees. I use to be a die hard fan. Jeter retired. Use to play fantasy football too for three years.
@Tara_Alexandra_ Nope... just have today off. I want to go see the Yankees and Nationals game. It's opening day.
@Tara_Alexandra_ you have work today?
@ImTooMuch pull up your damn pants
@ImTooMuch 25.
Your King is Coming. 
@_LesaLove thank you, Goddess
Black don't crack. That's all I gotta say.
@allovevie Thank you, Queen.
see, I'm a grown up. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
actually, I think I was twenty-three in that photo. but, you get my point.
I'm twenty-five. I swear. 
“@rachelathomson: @jadepoetics no you don't act young, you look young" I'm changing my avi. <WEARY FACE>
man, they still ask for my ID to see Rated R movies. It's cause I'm little -_-
@rachelathomson lol... really? I'm in grad school. I give out that young vibe. That's horrible. I teach 4th grade <WEARY FACE>
@rachelathomson I'm a Teacher. I know better.
this feeling I have of handing in this paper late is a feeling I never want to feel again.
when you send too much money trying to get another degree and collect more debt &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
“@RawanOG: Not ready for another week of school <PENSIVE FACE>” man, I just handed in my first paper 50 minutes late <UNAMUSED FACE>
the love/hate relationship I have with grad school -_- like who makes a project due on Easter.
@NoWomanIsRight <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@NoWomanIsRight hi! I've been getting hip!
eventually.
eventually, a time will come where you have to choose between who you are now &amp; who you want to be. action is always better than intention.
If nothing changes, nothing changes. And the truth is... I've grown and outgrown you.
so, this is happy? hmmm....
I've been healing for three months. Imagine how amazing I'll be in the next three months!
Eventually, you will get to the point where you'll laugh at your pain. Not cause it doesn't hurt, but because you realize it could be worse.
@Tara_Alexandra_ she is so perfect.
@Farylshappiness we all know you're 25. stop it.
@steph_smith123 I'll write you love poems. We slept together the first night <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> lmao well, in the same bed
I will never regret you. Always pray for you. You brought some really amazing people in my life. I'll forever be grateful.
@Farylshappiness me too <WEARY FACE>
@steph_smith123 do you want them baked, mashed, fried, sautéed, scalloped, hashed?
@Farylshappiness <EYES>
@steph_smith123 okay... potatoes, rice, or pasta?
@steph_smith123 what kind of meat you want? I'll be sure to make spinach.
“@steph_smith123: Im craving sautéed spinach <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>” that's my favorite veggie 
@Maize_N_Blue201 @DiaryofAkuoma cause I got a job. -_- my students don't have spring break until next week.
@iamslickrick_ I never forgot you, boo <FACE THROWING A KISS> lmaoooo now, share!
@iamslickrick_ share the love!
@Uchesofly 30 seconds?
@Uchesofly I'm sorry about all these questions. I'm trying to get my life together.
@Uchesofly For how long? 30 minutes a day?
@Uchesofly how much a day? And just running or... you look great btw.
@Uchesofly share your secrets
@DiaryofAkuoma just make sure next week when I'm in Atlanta, I don't want to return to DC
@DiaryofAkuoma <UNAMUSED FACE> you're horrible.
@DiaryofAkuoma wait! for me!
@GabbyMangar you'd get fat like me.
@GabbyMangar sorry, one of those pictures I cropped from my IG. Here is a better one. 
@GabbyMangar what's your favorite kind of meat? chicken, steak, pork, lamb, seafood?
@GabbyMangar I'm just a tweet away
@steph_smith123 It will be fun. I'll bring my baby cousin and play fake momma. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@AisforAlex's books are amazing. I thank @steph_smith123 for sharing them with me. I had to buy my own copies! Buy them! They are worth it!
@steph_smith123 I searched for a dress. I have to find one that fits <WEARY FACE> Let's go shopping!
@steph_smith123 <WEARY FACE> now, I'm happy. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@steph_smith123 I owe you so much. Next weekend, whatever you want. I'll make.
@steph_smith123 <EYES><EYES><EYES> why???
@Ms_KTaylor @AisforAlex Buy her book. Words from a Wanderer on Amazon. It will help.
@ZeeNTheCity I haven't been studying for it. I'm going to decide tomorrow.
@SurefireSCal yes. we are in agreement.
@ZeeNTheCity not until you take me on another date. I think I'm going to change my exam date.
“@deesseNoni: @jadepoetics can I give you books in exchange for food” yessss!!!!!! you speak my language!
“@ThisCantBeLyf: @jadepoetics do you have snapchat?” Nope... should I?
y'all don't want to buy me groceries. -_-
hire me. 
“@NinjaNik: @jadepoetics @MissAngelaDavis WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED?! Lol” Merryland.
I need a new hobby or to perfect an old one. I'm going to sign up for culinary school. I have to put this energy somewhere.
hire me. 
Cooking for people makes me happy. They don't use me for my meals. I use them for their bellies.
I cook for people. That's what I do. I got no man to cook for anymore so I'm auctioning myself off to the person who buys the best groceries
@ImNotLatina When I come to California, I'll cook for you. I'm going to Spain in July, so after that trip... Cali.
“@ImNotLatina: Can I cook?!  What kind of question is that???” I like that question!
@FundsOverFun you're a savage
my body your playground. my mind your library. my heart your love. my soul your solace. everything I am is for you.
every single time I doubt the existence of you, I remember we were created for one another.
this is all in preparation for the man I will call King, the daughter who will know she is royal, the son who will never forsake his throne.
I really want to stomp and throw a tantrum, but a Queen told me to stop losing my crown on purpose.
I catch myself often wishing for skinned knees instead of a broken heart, but then, I remember in time, both heal.
I wouldn't trade in the pain because without it, I would give back all the lessons I learned in the process of getting hurt.
a flower never complains after its blossomed. it longed to see the sun, endured the winter. nurture the seed. harvest will come.
sometimes we just want them to feel our pain.. understand what part they played in our demise but, not a thing has ended. rebirth yourself.
be graceful in struggle and grateful in success.
sometimes it's hard watching someone struggle, but they too... must learn that it isn't the load, but how you carry it.
learn to let go of dead weight. someone else's burden is not yours to carry.
stay committed to the things that are going to help you grow and the people that are going to help you get there.
"Dysfunction isn't love." @AisforAlex 
the hardest part about letting go is not going back for it.
today, I went through every emotion possible. so I read through it. prayed through it. slept through it. instead of faces it.
“@_AlfieGrey: You think love is dying because you keep people who kill it” this.
a man who takes charge.
My problem. 
@lovethediosa have the happiest birthday, Queen.
@SqueezeMePlz your avi &gt;&gt;&gt;
Send me books and groceries and some chamomile tea.
I bought six books today. <WEARY FACE>
@AisforAlex I went to Barnes and Noble in search for your books, in hopes that they would be there waiting for me today.

my books, my journey: 

book 1 | 

book 2 | 
Pray for them. Ignore them. 
this will help you when you feel like going back to a man you know you don't belong with. 

Lo…
No matter what I go through, I'll never give up on love. What's the point of life without it?
“@_cxmplexity: Relationships just never work for me. Guess not everyone is meant to find the one.” Don't believe this. Not for a second.
Thank you for my good luck charm. @steph_smith123 
Those wake up lines on the highway just saved my life for the 100th time
@ThisCantBeLyf lmaoooooo Okay
@ThisCantBeLyf the meek shall inherit the earth. people tend to associate being kind with weakness, but endurance can never be that.
I will not buy anymore books till I finish the books in my library.
"Choose being kind over being right."
What books should I pick up this week?
No place I rather get lost in. Bookstore.
"Does the spoon taste the soup? A fool may live all his life in the company of a master and still miss the way."
"holding on to anger is like grasping hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else, you are the one who gets burned."

I've decided to get lost in DC today by myself. This shall be interesting.
DC is so beautiful. I think it's home now.
@chelseabriworld it was fun. I don't go out and drink. It was definitely different, but exciting.
“@chelseabriworld: @jadepoetics good morning did you have good birthday <WHITE SMILING FACE>️” LMAOOO my friend steph lied to the DJ. my bday was in January
the key to a successful break up is to start putting your energy into new activities. find the parts of yourself buried.
all the things you wouldn't do, she did for herself.
@Sinatra7Trees The 15th I think that's my flight
@Sinatra7Trees I'm going to be in Atlanta

"Women like you don't stay single too long."
"I don't want to be with you, but I don't want anyone else to have you, so I stayed."
We will stay with a person..we know isn't for us so no one else will have them and benefit off the time we invested and continue to waste.
When you let someone else take the credit for something you did because they need it more than you.
Opening your mouth can ruin everything 
if leaving feels like an option, it's probably cause it's the best choice.
those nights where you are battling with yourself about staying or going.
We enable people. I'm an enabler by default. Stuck on stupid.
I mean why should he change if you and you're going to keep doing everything for him and stay committed.
I literally became the perfect girlfriend to cheat on because I was willing to stay through anything &amp; still cook, clean, and work.
I thought I could convince a man to be faithful and come home to me at night, boy.., was I wrong.
“@Richard_Gom: @jadepoetics if I close my eyes then it never happened.” negrooooooooo
You can cook like a chef. Screw like a porn star. Look like a model. Be a doctor. And still get played.
Not a thing you can do from stopping a man who wants to cheat. Only he can stop himself.
Him: "You were just too perfect." 

Me: "Nah, you were just too greedy."
You do something multiple times... Guess what? It ain't an accident. It's a habit.
nahhhhh... cheating isn't a mistake. that's a bad habit.
@Ivan_splash oh lord
I appreciate my mess just fine..."
It's interesting watching a man say, "You're the one" while cheating on you.
You don't miss oxygen until you can't breathe.
They want to do everything for you when you are no longer around.
But, y'all don't want girlfriends.  Y'all want doormats.
Your love may be unconditional, but your relationship shouldn't be. conditions of love, honor, and respect is mandatory.
Cheating isn't a mistake. It isn't an accident. You don't accidentally pick a spot to meet up at and undress.
She didn't quit on you. You quit on you when you cheated on her repeatedly.
It's not selfish to take care of yourself.
People RT this picture, but stay cheating &amp; lying then, questioning why someone would leave. Negro, have a seat. 
@PaulTheEsquire man, what! my family jerks everything.

@UPTMillz I have to check the slander before it comes my way. lmao. have a good day!
@thatdamnfrank thank you!
@RooseveltChaun I showered and washed my face. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
that eye boogie decided to kill my selfie game this morning. <WEARY FACE> 
This morning feels so good.
I withdrew away from my faith because I got caught up in religion.
Dear God, I hope you have an awesome day.
"I won't go back. I can't go back to the why I use to be before your loving came and changed me."
I hope you always feel my voice when I'm praying because there is not a prayer that escapes that doesn't include you. 
i tell my students all the time. justify your response. where is the evidence to support your claim?
grow up before she outgrows you.
all those things you did to get her, you better continue doing all those things to keep her.
Consistency. She is looking for something constant.
@UPTMillz now I want mangos
@UPTMillz Alright... I take it back. Your dinner was better.
@SeanTheTerrible lmaoooooo I guess I'm not dope.
@yungchipotle red peppers*
@yungchipotle I'm assuming shrimp fettuccine in alfredo sauce with peas and tomato chunks
@UPTMillz I made jerk shrimp last night. I had a lot left over. I sautéed it with spinach and tortellini. It was so yum.
@Dedicated_steve lmaoooo I haven't had one in awhile. I'm nicer and calmer now.
@UPTMillz My dinner was better though.
@Dedicated_steve Yeah... tell them not to slander me
@UPTMillz <EYES><EYES><EYES>
Protect your peace.
a friend sent me this today. she said, it reminded her of me. I can see why. 
God is strength 
God is hope
God is faith
God is peace 
God is forgiveness 
God is patience 
God is caring .
so, this made my day. 
I feel your spirit all over me. It's in my hands...down to my feet.
Greet this morning with love in your heart.
@SaintPatBeatz what's the name?
That was part of the plan. She gets good grades in school and I buy her phone and in return, she answers my facetime messages.
When my little sister doesn't answer my facetimes, it makes me want to cancel her plan.
@SaintPatBeatz it's either @jadepoetics or @wordsncurves
@SaintPatBeatz LMAOOO you don't even follow me
@iamslickrick_ <PENSIVE FACE> I'll make you some! you gotta be able to handle the spicy.
this man left me 97 notifications on IG. ain't no way in life I'm that interesting.
I just made some jerk shrimp. My mouth is on fire.
@LaurielAlesia and your body is flawless cause of it

Whatever you believe in, you give your energy too.
Today has been beautiful already. Meditation can alter your whole perspective.
You were looking, but you weren't paying attention.
I will run out of time before I run out of blessings. I will run out of life before I run out of love.

What Akuoma say?
I slightly felt groupie-ish. Like a little drool was at the corner of my mouth.
I just went through @Dade2Shelby photos. I am almost this man has endless women at his disposal.
Amaya could post selfies all day. I don't mind her selfies.
@HoneyyDip__ should have way more followers. She is so damn gorgeous and humble. Beauty inside and out.
@ImNotLatina his knee can't be that high though
@HoneyyDip__ girl, why are you so stunning?
@ImNotLatina has to be
@DiaryofAkuoma lmaooo do my assignment too <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@DiaryofAkuoma mine are all due at midnight. this can't be life. I have to stop procrastinating.
I just finished this grad school assignment and I feel like my head is about to explode like seriously... this was ridiculous.
@chelseabriworld never worth it.
“@chelseabriworld: About to start treating people how they treat me” No, be kind anyway. Never lessen yourself based on another's actions
I couldn't count the reasons this person meant so much to me, but I was terribly sad and they sent me love&amp;laughter. 
@yusufyuie @_drree I can't breathe <WEARY FACE>
This would be the perfect lockscreen for a dad.
@Maize_N_Blue201 you threw me in the trash can! I had to run from you after school daily!
@ArieeSimone #HeyBoo
@Maize_N_Blue201 @april_xD nahhhhh......
@Maize_N_Blue201 @april_xD -_-
@Maize_N_Blue201 You threw me in the trashcan in high school. I will not be BAE!
@Maize_N_Blue201 LMAO ESPN 30 for 30. Great Documentary! Like I love it!
@DiaryofAkuoma @Maize_N_Blue201 fine! I'll watch.
@DiaryofAkuoma @Maize_N_Blue201 I don't watch college basketball and I currently don't care about the Knicks. So basketball is a no go.
“@DiaryofAkuoma: @jadepoetics @Maize_N_Blue201 FootballJade &gt;&gt; EVERY OTHER JADE” -_- only if you help me with my fantasy team this year!
@DiaryofAkuoma @Maize_N_Blue201 In my defense, Kentucky players all go to the NBA. Calipari doesn't even need to recruit. They just flock.
@Maize_N_Blue201 I just can't please her. She likes me better during football season.
@Maize_N_Blue201 @DiaryofAkuoma I don't like college ball? I'll watch it when a new Fab 5 return and win a championship. Deal?
Akuoma curses me out during commercials.
I hope Akuoma's bracket is all jacked up. Massacred. Demolished.
@DiaryofAkuoma but publicly? daily? see, if I move in with you, you are going to make me watch March Madness.
@DiaryofAkuoma as friends in real life we should just block each other cause you slander me too much!
“@DiaryofAkuoma: Jade, basketball is on. Go somewhere please. Maybe, the kitchen.” LMAO I don't like college basketball <PENSIVE FACE>
You are sexy and extraordinary and fierce. Too magnificent to settle for any man who would put you in a cage to suffocate your voice.
words and curves. I'm back. 
@JosephAParker not yet.
Let the church say amen. Haven't felt this free in a long time. 
@pgoodiezz As soon as I edit it
“@JosephAParker: @jadepoetics do you perform your works anywhere?”haven't performed since January
If nothing changes, nothing changes. And the truth is, I've grown.
So search beneath every spread leg and under every glass. Search at every party and every country and every lie.
"Completeness comes, what is in part disappears."
Everything else will cease, but Love never fails. Patient. Kind. Humble. Giving. Protects. Trusts. Hopes. Preservers.
So, speak in tongues and have your prophecies, but without love, you gain nothing.
True love is in First Corinthians 13. It's not about religion. It's about a power greater than yourself.
You will travel far and wide to see that true beauty is within the eyes of the woman who bows before God.
But, soon, you will see that everything you want is already internal. It is within you. So, no pyramid or Great Wall will fix that.
What you are searching for, go ahead find it. Find it in the many women you brought into our home and our bedsheets when I was at work.
Love without God is like food without flavor. It will sustain you, but always leave you thirsty, empty, soulless.
You'll always want more. Never satisfied because you searched for a new place to lay your heart or whatever that is nightly.
You are a coward playing a joker who really is a King and I promise until you overcome your fears, you'll always be waiting.
So, don't tell me I gave up on you. No, you gave up on you. You didn't give a damn about me in that process. You quit on yourself.
I loved you when you were broken and when you were built.
I loved you on your worst days when you were wicked and cruel and I loved you on your best days when you were magnificent.
Because I loved deeply and incredibly and without apology.
I have sacrificed without regrets. I wouldn't  take a single moment of it back. Not one. Not the tears. Not the heartache. None of it.
But, I won't hate me. Not anymore. Not for anyone. I hated me for a long time. No longer.
I will pray for you always and often and more than myself like I always have.
As long as you are happy. As long as you are loved. As long as you are protected.
If hating me and making me the villain will make you happy then go ahead. I'll be that.
You were the one for me. I believed that, so I came back and stayed as you disrespected me and mistreated me.
Prayer Part 1. I hope you always feel my voice when I'm praying. 
I can't wait to edit that piece.
“Above all else, guard your heart because everything flows from it”
Prayer. Dear God, let us grow more in you and less in us that we transcend beyond this world into love. Feel my prayer.
Willing to take punches for you. I thought we were sparring and I never knew we were competing instead of complimenting one another.
The thing is you never had to kick my back in, so you could stand straight. I would have gladly bent before breaking for you.
And with it the arrival, of me. A roadmap back to myself that was buried beneath your giant feet. I can walk without you.
And I'm praying. I'm requesting. I'm asking for someone to make sense of this. I've giving you my five senses. I sensed this departure.
Cause I was so wrapped up in you. That you became my pulse and I wasn't willing to survive without you.
It wasn't natural or normal to banter like crashing cars on a daily basis. We lost our places and I had to go find me again.
I made you my life. A home out of a human being who I didn't feel safe with. No longer any laughter. We stained our walls with disaster.
Do you feel my voice when I'm praying? Begging, pleading, that this pain will soon subside and I can get back to my life.
I lost my soul cause I had too. To be with you. I sold it.
I'm stating the obvious. We were just trying to make the shoe fit. Willing to lose some toes in the process. A sole if we had too.
Habitually lying that this was from God, of him, so we mixed prayer and church and state.
We were too in the world trying to justify &amp; make sense out of our stupidity. We made mistakes on purpose. The same ones became bad habits.
Self-hatred from nights I would stare at the broken reflection of myself ricocheting back God's promises of a man who worshipped him.
I just never knew that would seclude my greatness cause I thought loving you was what I was created to do. But, that love turned to turmoil.
Darling, it always includes you.
And I hope you always feel my voice when I'm praying cause there is not a pray that escapes my lips that doesn't include you.
I did what was best because I wasn’t doing the best I could, so I had to leave, so both of us could succeed. We were co-dependent.
Selfishly, I wanted to keep you and not give you back to the creator to help heal you because I knew that would mean a life without me.
I’m not mad anymore. I understand. I wasn’t the problem, but I enabled the addiction that’s why you never got clean.
There are plenty of hers to recall because I trusted you with all of me and you poured all  of me into all of them and I was left poor.
It led to a lot of nights on bathroom floor &amp; kitchen floor &amp; me floored by waves of tears that crashed every time you placed me in her.
I submitted without fear when I should have been fearful of what temptation and instant gratification would lead too.
I raveled myself in all of you and as I disrespected my vows to the one above, I laid them in you for promises of one being your wife.
We lost sight of God cause we were sinning and boy, for a second we called it happiness.
I see you, King. I see what you could be and I was hoping us together would manifest the royalty that runs through your veins.
It didn’t.
And I know I seem awful cold and some days heartless, but I can’t love you up close anymore. I’m too blinded by your potential.
Asking God to please allow both of us to grow in his grace &amp; leave our fleshly ways behind because we couldn’t do it together.
I hope you always feel my voice.
You always needed it more than me and not a day will go by where a prayer from my lips doesn’t include you.
I’ve always been ready to suffer the consequences of giving to those who await my destruction because they always need it more than me.
I’ve always loved with arms wide open. 
Hands longing to hold whatever pain you possess and crumble it with kisses of life.

@UTxJGTheDon I was a bit of a condescending, judgmental, indulgent bitch who was too preachy several years ago. growth is a beautiful thing
@UTxJGTheDon Who would report me that many times? I have no idea.
@UTxJGTheDon I got reported -_-
@UTxJGTheDon Huh?

@jadeant8889 I'm glad they helped someone. I need to start following my own advice.
@jadeant8889 congrats love
in other news, I went to Barnes and Noble and got the book my father engrained in my head growing up 
This is what I call a win/win situation. He either grows up or you outgrow him. Either way, you win.
You have to ask yourself some vital questions before you leave. One of them being is how much longer can you do this...
Leaving is easier than not going back. I have a tendency to go back. I like to exhaust all my options before I give up.
@reginamariahh trust me, I was too familiar with bathroom floors and locking myself in the closet. Leaving was the easy part.
I've never been one to damage a man's stuff. I can see how a woman could get to that point, but the best revenge will always be success.
@reginamariahh best way to leave. I pack, I clean the house, I make sure dinner is made, I leave a note, and then, I move out in one trip.
When you leave a man, leave peacefully. It is so much better that way. You leave with acceptance and no regrets.
“@DiaryofAkuoma: Fear is a crutch. I just need everyone to be aware of that. It's limiting.” I'm not afraid.
I am totally not a gullible airhead. I might a little green and overly trusting and forgiving. Okay, I'm a gullible airhead.
@CuffsTheLegend ouch. I felt that one.
@DiaryofAkuoma my aunt said millionaires leave in this one. She is a realtor. She said, 25% of the housing unit has to be affordable.
@UPTMillz which is?
@DiaryofAkuoma I didn't even experience DC yet. I was leashed to a townhouse and didn't get to play.
@DiaryofAkuoma reread quotes from The Alchemist. Feel like my treasure is in Spain. And I have the money to book a trip like right now.
I just moved to DC last year. It hasn't even been a year yet.
@TakeaLanae <EYES>
@UPTMillz Would you leave DC?
I've always had a roommate or living with family. I'm not one of those people that dream of coming home to an empty home.
so, my aunt mentioned about this income based housing waterfront property in DC. But, I have no desire to live by myself.
@UPTMillz I heard the food out there is to die for.
@DiaryofAkuoma I am visiting you in two weeks. We are booking our flight to Spain. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@yusufyuie I bet! So when are you going to bring your wife to dinner? *waits patiently for your Queen
Everybody in Atlanta. Is this the new move?
@yusufyuie Your mom so dope!!
@LosBeOnIt Everyone is exhausted of getting hurt. Be exhausted of your decisions that get you there. Not of life.
Today is Beautiful. The key to getting more is to be happy for what you currently got.
@LosBeOnIt Never the solution. "If you took back the pain, you'd have to give back the strength you gained."
"God didn't say you should stop dancing. God just said you should find a new partner."
"sometimes when we hit rock bottom, it's because God made the rock."
"what you voluntary participated in..."
"classic mistakes that young women make..."
When love for someone else becomes self-hatred and a question of self-worth, it is no longer love.
You want to believe they will change, that this time will be different, that you could help them, heal them, grow with them.
She loves him. Yes, she would defend him.  I know I was in her position and did the same thing repeatedly.
@Maize_N_Blue201 Let me get myself together.
“@Maize_N_Blue201: Just need @jadepoetics to visit me once so I can introduce her to my classmates.” <EYES> you trying to set me up?
@UPTMillz @ZeeNTheCity Y'all tropical skin <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> I'm Black too, man!
@ZeeNTheCity @UPTMillz This is why Black people don't prosper! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> I hate yall.
@UPTMillz only farmers, fishers, and bakers twice. <WEARY FACE> I lost my list. And @ZeeNTheCity flakes and I got no friends. I'd have to go solo
@skyzoo @yusufyuie <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> Let's go to a game. Tickets probably wicked cheap.
“@yusufyuie: This season literally made me stop watching the Knicks. Smh” @skyzoo is the only fan left
@ZeeNTheCity Dragon Lady? I expected more from you.
@UPTMillz I'm a fat girl, so this is where we connect.

@ZeeNTheCity I'm going to work at Stadium. Put it to good use. We can go on vacation. What should my stripper name be?
@ZeeNTheCity lmao I can't fight. It's the only threat I got. It got bigger since we last saw each other. All of me did. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@ZeeNTheCity weirdo. that was a threat!
“@Mr_February16: @jadepoetics &lt;---- intelligent, huge heart and can cook.....<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>” and has no man <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> such is life.
@UPTMillz don't tease me. how do you know all these food places? like for real!
“@ZeeNTheCity: @jadepoetics I'm a Cancer. This weather isn't compatible with my soul miss lady.” I'm going to sit on you.
@UPTMillz Can I go? <WEARY FACE>
@ZeeNTheCity I want a divorce.
@ZeeNTheCity -_- I need to go out on a weekly. Aren't you suppose to help me come out of my shell?
@ZeeNTheCity We were suppose to go to the movies. Girl, I went out yesterday. Like left the house and went out.
“@ZeeNTheCity: @UPTMillz Can't hoe sufficiently with thermals dear.” <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@ZeeNTheCity I'm here. And all yours.
@ZeeNTheCity <EYES>

@RawanOG beautiful as always.
You spend too much time saying you're not ready instead of simply getting ready and then, you'd already be ready.

I just moved to D.C. and maybe, I haven't really given this a chance on my own without a support system.
Moving to Atlanta might be the best thing I can do for myself, but I can't help but to feel like I've been running.
the answer has always been love. love frequently. love often. love always.
Peace. It comes if you hold still long enough.
I'm going to try not to be something I'm not. Sometimes you try something on just to try it and realize it was out of your character.
Watching people without rhythm dance is too priceless
I'm not about this life. It's bedtime.

“@baeElectronica: RT @afropunk: AFRO OF THE DAY #678 
If they don't offer you respect, then they can never offer you love.
@Alisha__Anne I haven't read a series like that  in a while.
@TishaRaquel wait... you're in Atlanta? I'm going in two weeks!
@TishaRaquel you deserve it!
I need to stop falling asleep while I'm driving. Sick people shouldn't drive.
@Titty_expert I'll be right before then
“@Leortiz12: Can yall believe that im here jamming to mexican music? Lmao” yes.
@rachelathomson that's awesome advice. thank you.
@Jcsw14 <UNAMUSED FACE> okay.
@Titty_expert don't judge me!
@Jcsw14 negro, not in a good ways in the super-sized version of me.
plain jane.
@Jcsw14 tripled. but so did everything else. And breast* they are called BREAST.
It is what it is and now, it's about what you do about it.
@Jcsw14 trust me. I've gained over twenty pounds since that Avi was taken.
@Jcsw14 HELL NO. I look like you can roll me down the stairs.
@Jcsw14 fair enough. I'm fat now though.
and I'm sick. I lost my voice and my students told me I sounded like a man. <UNAMUSED FACE>
@rachelathomson <WEARY FACE> I'm going to try it. Probably, save me some money.
@Jcsw14 you're a man. I'm a 4'11" midget.
@iamslickrick_ I just started working out again this week and take my vitamins.  Give me 30 days.
@Titty_expert hey, don't Uh Oh me.
@iamslickrick_ you don't love me when I'm fat? this is horrible.
When I went to the mall and I couldn't fit a small in tops or a medium in bottoms. I nearly through myself on the floor and cried.
@iamslickrick_ I've gained weight like this before and lost it. Remember, in college I went skinny, got HUGEEEE, slimmed back down.
It was easier to eat than deal with the problem. So, I ate. Often. All the time. I wouldn't even be hungry. I would just eat.
@iamslickrick_ Negro, I'm HUGE. I look like I ate the Jade you know.
I took advantage of my depression. I was EATING EVERYTHING.
@iamslickrick_ No, I gained a lot of weight in the last several months. Eating my feelings. Now, that the feelings are gone. I'm ready.
@RegalRobynn Are you trying to send your son there? If so, do it. It's really a beautiful school.
@RegalRobynn Janney is a good school, but PARCC is a more rigorous tests. That test will soon be obsolete.
Gives me time to put my fat ass on a treadmill. I really got to get it together.
I'm so excited to go to Atlanta in two weeks. <WEARY FACE> Sad my trip to Cali and Houston got postponed until the summer.
I always tell my students that leaders know how to take direction.
I've grown accustomed to being choosey with who I follow. I'm not trying to be led in a ditch.
@iamslickrick_ have a wonderful birthday.
"If nothing changes, nothing changes."
I've learned not to dim. I've learned not to fight for things that are meant to leave your life. Let go.
Waves ricochet that light.
But, love shouldn't fluctuate based on your mood. It should be constant. Even when you get up close the dark side of the moon still shines.
Growth is a process that must not be rushed. We harvest at different times. Occasionally, there is an influx.
Sprouted my leaves. My nectar, still sweet.
Clarity is beautiful
When you realize either way you win.
I've outgrown you before you could grow up.
And although, you are changing. 
I can't help, but to stare at the fact
We have nothing in common. 
Not one single thing.
Is it worth it?
At least, tell me they were worth it. 
That you found happiness every time you went there.
How could I be so dumb? 
To break for someone who ignores my pain for his fun
We were sinking on purpose
You tried everything and anything to ruin us 
But, I still loved you as my love began to coil into self-hatred
It's hard to believe I was the writer in this relationship.
From the moment we met, you played me like a poet musically inclined with melodic verses you spun fairy tales, fantasies, and legends.
Wasn't afraid to lose my wings
Because how could loving you be so wrong?
But, it was never right...
Convinced myself I knew better than my creator No matter how many times the light was in the opposite direction I flew towards the darkness.
Realistically, I knew better than to meddle with who chosen for my prospect, but I thought it was a possibility God hadn't realized yet.
Daily, I played make-belief in hopes that these dreams God didn't have planned for me would become a reality.
I needed something to grasp, so I held on to you. I made you.. life support to hold up my bad habits and hold down a lie. I lied to myself.
Sometimes we just need that last try.
I think the best break ups are mutual agreements that this is no longer beneficial where both parties are calm and happy.
If it's for you, it's going to be for you regardless.
Clarity is a beautiful thing.
Poetry in the morning.
@SirMervCharles I explained that I was mix, but I still consider myself Black. He said, I wasn't Black him.
My teaching coach left me this letter before she left. 
This is all going on while I am being observed by my teaching coach.
Then, she explained why she thinks segregation does still exist. She was so right.
And then, a student asked, "If segregation doesn't exist, why are there only Black students in our school? "
Then, a student said, "Well, Ms. McKenzie's mom is Chinese."
Then, he asked me why I wasn't Black and I said, I was but he said I wasn't Black like him. And I asked him why he thought that.
My student raises his hand and asks me today, "Why are you caramel?" I almost fell out of my seat.
Every day is a challenge in the classroom, but every single day I learn about patience.

Morning Motivation. 
I'm out of shape. I just went for a run. Sat here for what... 30 minutes... now, my legs are in incredible pain.
@ImNotLatina LMAOOO I believe this statement. Somethings about Cancer Men that are suffocating to me.
I mean... six year old me is probably incredibly disappointed in 25 year old me.
I can't believe I'm 25 and only on my first master's. my life plan did not go as expected at all.
@UTxJGTheDon why not? I like collecting accolades for things I just do just to do it.
@BriannaAmor are you really that incredibly ideal? you are beautiful.
@UTxJGTheDon I don't know. Be a housewife in all honesty. be an awesome mother.
One day.
Of all the things I could do with my life, I think my greatest accomplishment will be being someone's wife and being someone's mother.
"Don't judge anyone's growth process. We all take different amounts of time for different reasons to figure it out."
