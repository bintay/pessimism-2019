@selena__gomzzz @intfactsofliffe how was she beaten?
@lilacstranger or even put her in her in her in her third
@lilacstranger Hepburn is a knockout but I'd put her in her in third after Judy Garland and Grace Kelly
I could watch this all day. The prettiest woman who ever lived and a dancer who played everyone off the park


@Sarah_and_dog the medium in which they fought would play a big part. But all things being equal, I think I agree
@Sarah_and_dog ha! Course not. I just remembered the clip ;) I'm not sure anything could win against a shark. Even a whale
@Sarah_and_dog oh no. Sorry to spoil the party. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Also, your tweet reminded me of this! 
@Sarah_and_dog Jaws loves fresh water. Basically, unless 'ol man River gets a bigger boat he's toast
@Sarah_and_dog ha! "He just keeps rollin..."
@Sarah_and_dog 6th June. Grab ''Ol Man River' at 10/1. The boy can run 
@Barrister79 @JJ_brum My passport's out of date. Sorry. It's a pity because I make a mean Bakewell tart
@Barrister79 @JJ_brum I'm right about some things
@Barrister79 @JJ_brum Hey, give me a break. I love Newcastle. I actually went once. It was really nice
@JJ_brum Can I hear a gravy train?! Anything good?
She has a face only a mother could love. But she can dance. Boy, can she dance 
@JJ_brum @Barrister79 You're going to Newcastle? J, you know it's cold and quite dangerous?
@CrimBarrister You can get them for £300. Treat yourself. They're lovely. You can use the damages you'll win after suing the delivery co.
@CrimBarrister @House_of_Bath Ah, soon as I sent the tweet I wondered. £500 worth of scarf being nicked wouldn't be a good start to the wknd
@CrimBarrister @House_of_Bath Hermès? Ouch
@LGCForensics Yes
@foxyjewels @_Poots_ Lol!
@EmmaJackson78 Maybe we could form some sort of group
@EmmaJackson78 Oh, God. It has a small Nicola Sturgeon growing out of it! Are those bag pipes?
@_Jardy_ Look. We can do dinner at 7pm sharp every night or we can live on the edge
@_Jardy_ huh?
@PegFluffGlenn it's a type of shit music that people pretended to like in the late '90's
@EmmaJackson78 knitted seems safer. But I suppose in the end any type of doll can be very dangerous. Maybe?
@_Jardy_ I have two balls
@_Jardy_ Hey little chaffinch, what I want I get. Whether it's a buffalo or a fly. I'll take that mother down, baby 
@_Jardy_ I can't believe you called @Justin_Gau a vicar. Be dammed. Also, I volunteered us to do some volunteering. Sounds like fun
@EmmaJackson78 Knitted dolls are okay. But the ones with eyes freak me out
@EmmaJackson78 Defo not clowns. Or porcelain. So the other once
@EmmaJackson78 Is it wrong to have a doll collection? Is that wrong?
@The_Bounder Toast
Ooh I lost my seat, darling. Can you make me toadt? And give me a . I've been told to stop
Everyone's feeling sorry for Ed Balls but he's punching well above his weight. His wife is quite fit. And he'll be like,
Nicola Sturgeon isn't good looking enough. She's on the verge. But I really don't think she'd ever be someone that 'you would'
I'm going to say what everyone else is is thinking
@awedgewood @_Jardy_ @soapstars2k I wish. It's BBQ racing pigeons and that cat on the roof at the beginning
@awedgewood @EnglishMum @_Jardy_ @soapstars2k Oh sorry. But I hope David gets custody. Well, my mum does. She feeds me snippets
@EnglishMum @awedgewood @_Jardy_ @soapstars2k Think she just called you 'boring', Wedgewood.
@_Jardy_ @awedgewood @soapstars2k @EnglishMum Are you incapable of having a conversation without it becoming sexually depraved?
@_Jardy_ @awedgewood @soapstars2k @EnglishMum No, I meant it as in, "she's a lad, banter, etc"
@awedgewood @soapstars2k @EnglishMum Adrian! They're called 'ladies' now
@soapstars2k @awedgewood @EnglishMum This is complex. Let's all meet up and untangle it

That dress is hidz. I thought the TV needed re-tuning. #TeresaMay #GE2015
If I was PM I'd be like, "Teresa, can you not dress in bright colours and silly shoes when you call for me?"
Nice dress Teresa
@EmmaJackson78 Lol! It was a guess. All girls like red wine. (And the typo's)
@EmmaJackson78 I knew it. I could tell
@EmmaJackson78 If you drink red you're just adjourning your hangover until tomorrow. The more 'see through' it is, the less it'll hurt
@EmmaJackson78 you really are. Okay. Just white wine then ;)
@EmmaJackson78 You've got to get back on it. It's Friday night. I prescribe a big white wine spritzer
@EmmaJackson78 what, you like gin but you don't like vodka? Interesting
@EmmaJackson78 hmm. I'm thinking
@EmmaJackson78 I'm quite good at this. I've so many more 'good' ideas
@EmmaJackson78 No, not gin. It'll make you more depressed. What you need is vodka
@EmmaJackson78 Just get drunk again and put your fingers in your ears. It works. Temporarily

@awedgewood Excellent. Happy Friday!

How would we import all the oil and cocaine from Aberdeen? And how do the submariners get to and from Faslane? @_Jardy_

@GRRRRRaham_King When it sounds too good to be true and all that
@legalcheek @TedTalksUK Bet he drinks Carling Black Label
You think it's one particle colliding in the #LHC. It's actually 600 million. Per second. Don't try and think about it if you get headaches
I'm buying my council house in Berkley Square. It's lovely if you've never been #torymanifesto

Ed Milliband's wife's not bad. Great figure. He's doing something right
@nearlylegal Until you wake up in the cells
@CrimeLineLaw @ObiterJ Ooh, more people in prison. Good thinking
@neillyfabi Lol!
Wish people would stop saying politicians are dishonest. Attack the party and the politics if you like. Leave the man alone
@neillyfabi Ha!
@neillyfabi sorry, flock off
@neillyfabi I'd say they klan all go flock and de

What's wrong?" 

"Arghh, it's not working again" #LHC 
@denny_robert But was it though. Maybe Hilary, Jackie etc should've been rougher with them
Although if she couldn't control the leader of the Free World how will she control the actual Free World?
Hillary Clinton? First female US president? Well drop your cocks and grab your socks. Hooorah
Chair's pissed again 
@JeSuisJardy The ship's carafe is still to come. Pass that to the left without taking out the crystal
My dad, dishing up 
@pjm1kbw Lol! Sorry ;)
@DavidAllenGreen @pjm1kbw Don't dominate my timeline with tweets about talking about tax policy
@mrchrisjohn @MrMirth @Harryb22 No helmets, shields or limb protection. They won't last five minutes against The Terrorists
@UKLabour @John_Cooper_QC Lol! Joke right?
@JeSuisJardy Kids shouldn't be watching it either. You'll look back in five years when you're 21 and regret you ever watched anything on ITV
There used to be a lovely Häagen Dazs café until those pesky Irish Republicans lifted it 100ft into the air @awedgewood
I was hoping for more of a settled long term thing. You look a bit too, well, porn-like. Sorry @GartmanNice
Don't even have a girlfriend. Christ
Love watching the replay. Like your girlfriend putting all your cash into a fruit machine and pressing start over and over again
@GRRRRRaham_King Sam Twiston-Davies
At least my bet didn't get a bucket of water thrown over him and can still walk. But he is still a silly, naughty, lazy horse
I would quite happily suit up and go into battle on Rocky Creek. Let's get this show on the road #GrandNational
Rocky and Shutthefuckup joint favourites. Kaboom. Where is my goddam slip? #GrandNational2015
@chrisdaleoxford Just hard enough so I could ring my clerks and say "you'll never guess..."
@chrisdaleoxford Maybe not. Although I did once ask a cabbie on the way to the strand whether he'd crash his car, but very gently
Oh f**k off Gok #aintree2015
@chrisdaleoxford Ha! When I need information I always ask a guy in the pub or a taxi driver #wise
@chrisdaleoxford The pub?
"Where's your broom"

"I don't think I have one"

"How do you brush the patio"

"The wind?"

Not good enough apparently

It's not called 'volunteering'

@PCDaveMcGarry @MrMirth They make comedy programmes for CH4
@yokelbear @MrMirth No, it was because the questions were getting in the way of his answers. That's why he sounded completely at sea

@msambergambler why?
@StokenchurchDR @lilacstranger  jack Russell x Norwich / Norfolk?
Even if my mother was flying
@msambergambler pretty sure most realistic safeguards were put in place after 9/11. I'd rather fly in a plane than drive in a car
@msambergambler Nothing should happen about this. It couldn't be helped. End
@msambergambler really? I know a few. Rich parents, not that clever
@msambergambler Bad plane crashes make bad rules
@msambergambler What? These people are professionals. If you can't trust your co-pilot to take controls then it needs a rethink
@msambergambler Maybe he was just a crap pilot
Or gin. Nothing wrong with gin
Maybe I could have vodka. It's see through so doesn't smell.

@DrAndrewWatt @JackofKent Sounds like it. Not sure I follow either
@TrollULike @BBCr4today @UKLabour I liked Blair. I thought he was a really good PM. Did so much for this country
"Yeah, okay, I'm a massive twat. Fight? Right now? Because one way or the other this ends here"
Anyone who insists they're tough isn't tough. If #Miliband was tough he'd just tell everyone to go screw themselves
@TrollULike @BBCr4today @UKLabour exactly. I would've voted for his brother though. Big mistake that was
@TrollULike @BBCr4today Why can't he just be himself? He sounds like such a nob when he goes all 'street'

@feakins25 He will. He's hard :)
Gay cakes? Seriously? Is nothing sacred? @SkyNews
Had a bad day? Arrow woke up at 2pm today with no balls and he has no idea why. And he's ten. And he's got a bad leg 
How did she know I'd been to Tesco?
Pity he didn't do the decent thing off the Golden Gate Bridge, assuming it was suicide and that it was not preventable @SkyNewsAmerica
Attack of the zombie pensioners in my local Tesco. Again. Maybe if they got a move on they wouldn't have such painful joints
@awedgewood Just pour out the shot, replace it with the plastic and fire. If you just want to really hurt them use uncooked rice
@CourtNewsUK  Slow news day?

@tara_snow @JJ_brum Made you both look though. Who's been on the substance now?
@tara_snow It doesn't come up that well over Twitter but if you zoom in its defo a UFO. It's a disc with a strange glow
@Ditzybootoo @ddz6006 
In the bottom right corner just under the rainbow

I've just been looking through my photos and I've inadvertently spotted a UFO! Seriously
@Ditzybootoo @ddz6006 Nice ass
I love @Ditzybootoo. That's not her real name. Clearly. But I love her. Thankyou
Ahem...
@Ditzybootoo  
@awedgewood And, there are no fossilised records
@awedgewood only if they're children or work in the public sector. Other than that they just drift about I reckon
@Justin_Gau maybe. Should be interesting
@awedgewood Ah the caelocanth. The original dinofish. I'd be a small trilobite. Scuttling about enjoying the sun
@awedgewood Wish I'd been a trilobite. Swimming about in a warm shallow sea, loads of trilobite mates, no worries, no overdraft
If I was #GrantShapps' lawyer I'd be somewhat conflicted after that performance #wato

@JeSuisJardy @cheekylisa32 F**k of
@barbara_hewson @CrimeLineLaw Reading days
@cheekylisa32 How very dare you! ;)
@cheekylisa32 I suppose you just laugh it off. Lad points. Think that's what I'd do. If I watched porn that is. My life is blemish free
@cheekylisa32 They may have been viewing it at home but using their judicial laptops and not realising. Doh!
@cheekylisa32 They book their holiday or play solitaire like the rest of us. Accept the defendant. They have to listen as punishment
@JuCollins No probs. I'll play you if you think you're up to the challenge! (I'm a bit rubbish)
@carnybull @Leisha007 ... the world isn't perfect. Some couples split up, some couples are the same sex etc
@carnybull @Leisha007 They aren't doing. They make them nice clothes. I think in a perfect world kids should have a mum and dad however...
@Leisha007 @carnybull Thanks for link. I must say I agree with the mum and dad point. Although I'm quite prepared to be told I'm wrong
@carnybull @Leisha007 Artificial insemination is synthetic so by definition... Although I suppose their comments had a deeper significance
@carnybull @Leisha007 How do you decide whose sperm to use? Toss up?
@carnybull @Leisha007 Were they saying it in the context of a gay relationship or generally?
@Defencebrief Blimmin eck. What's wrong with a creased up magazine hidden in the hedge in the local park? Times are changing...

@carnybull @Leisha007 Hugo Boss?
@carnybull @Leisha007 Quite. A bit like a multi-millionaire singer saying God is gay. Just luvvies talking s**t!
@carnybull @Leisha007 Ha! Missed that. I can kind of imagine though. "Lots of their friends are gay" etc!
@carnybull @Leisha007 I don't have a problem with what they said (I don't think I agree) but I'm not surprised by the reaction

@JardsyP No, it doesn't. That's why when I'm drunk I always carry my trusty chair leg in my coat pocket
@JardsyP Maybe the headline was pointing out the potential dangers of getting drunk in public. A sort of public service
@JardsyP Suppose having your laptop nicked isn't as bad as being raped
@JardsyP What would the public reaction be to the headline "Drunk man has laptop stolen"?

@tara_snow @JJ_brum @WGAbroad @MChawlaQC Yes but practically it makes not a jot of difference
@tara_snow @JJ_brum @WGAbroad @MChawlaQC Leave the burden of proof to the lawyers and the judge!
@tara_snow @JJ_brum @WGAbroad @MChawlaQC Or "you now have to try and convince the jury you didn't do it" What's wrong with that?
@JJ_brum @tara_snow @WGAbroad @MChawlaQC I'm not sure I would. I'd probably couch it in the terms the pamphlet does

@danbunting @carnybull I agree it's more complicated than a section 18 on a pub car park but more guidelines? Really?
Is it just CPS lawyers who don't understand consent? Are further guidelines really needed? It's not difficult. Maybe I'm missing something

He should never have apologised. It wasn't a proper apology anyway #stuartbroad

No need to worry. Unless you're on the run from the FSB that is @MissBickerstaff
Polonium 210 is 250K x more toxic than hydrogen cyanide. 1g is enough (technically) to poison 20m people, 10m lethally. Thought I'd share

Of the hundreds of thousands gassed at Chelmno there were two survivors. It's almost unimaginable

No. Guess what did win though? 'Oliver!'! Stupid depressing saccharine pile of Dickensian rubbish. Where's my Valium...
Stanley Kubrick nominated for best director for '2001'. Did he win? Nah. Idiots
Like Titanic. Seriously? It sucked
Who really gives a shit about the Oscars? The nominations are always obvious and they always choose the wrong winner
@frankiescar @pjm1kbw @Barristerblog Ha! Yep
@pjm1kbw @Barristerblog Yeah, caught me out too!
@TheRedRag @rabbitaway @Barristerblog @pjm1kbw possibly
@carnybull @BBCDomC FIGHHHHT!
@TheRedRag @rabbitaway @Barristerblog @pjm1kbw Dunno then mate. Maybe I'm wrong
@TheRedRag @Barristerblog @rabbitaway @pjm1kbw I think there were two counts on the indictment related to underage sex but he was acquitted
@TheRedRag @rabbitaway @Barristerblog @pjm1kbw Well yes. He got a custodial sentence for sex in a position of trust. But she wasn't underage
@TheRedRag @Barristerblog @rabbitaway @pjm1kbw Oh, sorry. But she was 16. Not 15
Law? Who cares about law? I just want to see Al Murray and Nigel Farage on Jeremy Kyle @BBCDomC
@TheRedRag @rabbitaway @Barristerblog @pjm1kbw Yes. That's why he got a prison sentence
@TheRedRag @Barristerblog @rabbitaway @pjm1kbw He was acquitted of sexual activity with a child. Convicted of abuse of trust
Right I'm off. If anyone needs me call my agent
.@CarryOnNigella @JardyShannon I remember Judy's vol au vents (made with Ainsley Hariott's recipe). Most unsavoury #LittleBritain
... I'm not going to court in my PE kit" then kick the headmaster in the balls and take the head girl out for a drink
Given the extreme lucidity of my dreams I can't understand why I don't think to myself, "I left school 16 yrs ago...
@WGAbroad I wouldn't. They've probably all gone paint balling or Alton Towers ;)
@_cerysjones Deep
@WGAbroad LOL! Do you think they're all having more fun in your absence?
@WGAbroad Don't worry, I will. Although I imagine they'll seize my devices. Two days off! What did you do to deserve that?
@Defencebrief He was cleared of 6/8 counts. Her mates gave evidence that she was "stalking" him. Supposed to have lied in the box too
@WGAbroad I'm off to hand myself in to my local police station
@Defencebrief Well the verdicts suggest that the jury concluded that's exactly what she did do
@WGAbroad I love stalking people's photos. Everyone does it. Don't they? Oh god...
@Kennington_Tube @carnybull Who would boil an egg in the same water you used to boil the potatoes? Poor people I suppose
@WGAbroad I know. Just going through your photos, as you do. Recognise Port Isaac. The one with the tall girl holding the fish!
@WGAbroad It's a treble clef or a shell. Am I right? Do I win??
We've all done it... “@vizcomic: 
@pjm1kbw @Barristerblog True. Justice must to be seen to be done. Particularly by readers of The Sun and The Daily Mail
@rupertajones Sounds riveting! ;)
@Barristerblog @pjm1kbw Quite. Clumsy sentencing remarks but sentence sounds fair
@pjm1kbw @Barristerblog Agreed. Although not sure it's unduly lenient in the circumstances. She was 16. But I've only read the DM report!
@pjm1kbw @Barristerblog You could see where she was coming from but the delivery was, well, unfortunate
@JardyShannon Oh fucking hell. Can't you tip the water out?
@Ditzybootoo @JJ_brum @WGAbroad Haha! Yep
@Jezhop Ha! That's pretty impressive though!
@Ditzybootoo @JJ_brum @WGAbroad "You're in a room. None of the buttons work and you're about to fall in a massive hole" Great.
@Jezhop Oh that's nice. That takes me back! ;)
@JJ_brum @Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad The ZX couldn't pull off complicated games. They were unplayable. Ever play Knightmare?
@Ditzybootoo @JJ_brum @WGAbroad Gauntlet? That was good
@JJ_brum @Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad Real?
@JJ_brum @Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad Noooooo
@JJ_brum @Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad Sounds ace!
@JJ_brum @Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad What's that?!
@Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad I love the line, "the sound's not great but it is an old game"!!
@Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad Check out this amazing review 
@Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad Horace goes skiing
@helen_trotter @WGAbroad Yeah it was great but also terrible at the same time. And the games were unplayable. Or was it cus I was 6?
@WGAbroad Got good games?
Oh my fucking god... “@SkyNews: New ZX Spectrum Goes On Sale In April 
@Ditzybootoo @ddz6006 @tara_snow Tigger was lazy too. But her tail went really big, she walked up to the bowl, flipper it out and ate it!
@Ditzybootoo @ddz6006 @tara_snow My fish died and I fed it to the cat. Seemed a waste to flush it
@ChrisClose50 @MrMirth Wasn't the bobby's fault. The lawyer didn't know what PD stood for and demanded a statement from him!!
@JardyShannon BABY! Make it do some tricks
Al Murray called me "spawn of Satan" at the Edinburgh fringe because I hadn't been christened. I was only 15. My mum went mental #election
@Fhamiltontimes Oh dear *face palm*
@awedgewood @JardyShannon Just make sure you don't water-board your niece tonight
@JardyShannon @awedgewood Fecking hell
@JardyShannon @awedgewood What have you done!!
@awedgewood @JardyShannon Good thinking. Watch the roots J
@JardyShannon @awedgewood The big one looks all flaccid
@JardyShannon @awedgewood Can you put one of those wooden BBQ kebab stick things in to train it? Now?
@JardyShannon @awedgewood Is that a third shoot??
@JardyShannon @awedgewood Er, you better be looking after my fledgling chilli plant
@RebeccaHerber44 Not exactly covered his tracks has he!
@paul_steele @cannmilliken I looked over the edge of those when I was about ten. My Mum nearly had a heart attack
Are the cows on #TheArchers real? The four legged ones? Or is it recorded?
Hmm. Won't let me tweet it. Never mind
It's Big Suze dressed up as Ayatolla Khomeini
It is NOT the Prophet Mohammed
I drew a cartoon
@JardyShannon No I'm not. Stop defaming me. I'll kill Big Suze
@JardyShannon From now on, you go through my PA
@JardyShannon Because this morning I had 37
@JardyShannon My spirit guide is the Space Coyote
Feckin' 'ell... 
@InspGadgetBlogs Different sentencing regime back then. Certainty and rule of law not rule of the mob
Although Roberts did spend 48 years in prison. It's a small footnote in an otherwise profound tweet ;) @InspGadgetBlogs
@chrisdaleoxford Ha! Touché!
If 'webinar' makes it into the OED I shall jump infront of a train
@ObiterJ Exactly. With rights come responsibilities
Ooh, Mohammed with a bomb in his turban. That's witty. It's also upset millions of nice people and a handful of people are now dead
This prophet cartoon business is getting rather childish. Can't we all grow up? It offends all muslims not just the baddies
@JardyShannon @awedgewood It's a good idea though isn't it? Just heard on the radio that old people still have sex. Is that true?
@awedgewood Ha! No, it would be an international coalition. All proceeds paid into the World Bank and distributed according to need
And give the Africans an allowance. Kick out the dictators. Everyone wins
The West should invade Africa and take all the diamonds, gold, oil and gas. Use the proceeds to stabalise the world economy
I've had an amazing idea
@VampireCounsel Listen to them, the children of the night...
@VampireCounsel What? Remind me
... can someone explain what is wrong with increased surveillance / ID cards etc?
Okay, so compared to most people on Twitter I'm really quite thick. I admit it. So...
Did the disc jockey on Radio2 just say he was going "to share his shuffle with listeners"?  Has the BBC learnt nothing from Savile? Disgrace
@helen_trotter Have you listened to Authur Lowe doing it on the radio? It's one of the funniest things I've heard
@helen_trotter It's one of those shows that I have to watch on my own because I laugh so much it annoys everyone and they think I'm weird
@helen_trotter There's a radio series?? I've not heard it. But I'm yet to try "you're hotter than a curry" as a chat up line. Do or die
"She's hotter than a curry". Why didn't I think of that 
I always think it's rather cuffy to humiliate people who are less learned than you. But that's just me. Old fashioned I suppose
Christ I've lost 17 followers. My free speech is falling on stony ground
That's free speech, done for good reason but you wouldn't condone it and you'd say I got what was coming to me
If I went up to a guy in a bar and said "excuse me mate, you wanna get rid of her, she's a dog" I'd get punched
I wasn't advocating killing people. I just thought the cartoons were stupid and likely to cause offense
@WGAbroad No but it's a predictable result. I thought the cartoons were childish and gratuitous
Free speech is like a get out of jail free card when someone says something and everyone thinks "WTF?"
If I said I thought Hitler had a few good ideas, particularly regarding the Jews, is that free speech or is that just offensive?
It smacked of provocation and my word did they get that
The problem with the cartoons was that they weren't funny. Not because they were offensive but because they just weren't funny
"You cannot kill a pear". Sounds like fighting talk @bbcgqt
I'm thinking of making hooch to sell to serving prisoners. Could the panel tell me the best variety of potato to use? @BBCGQT
@JardyShannon @awedgewood Should've been a test cricketer

I want to tweet something profound about the AQAP Paris attacks but I'm not clever enough. So instead...
@JardyShannon @awedgewood I can move pretty quick when I'm in mortal danger
@JardyShannon @awedgewood Lucky I dodged the candle holder. Or was that skill?

@awedgewood Haha! "Twat" though? Hmm, yeah, suppose
@Lodgie_ Ha! Quite
Wasn't République Française founded following the execution of 40,000 odd just for being posh?
Am I back on Twitter?
@wadwellington Haha!
@taxbod Clearly not
@danbunting @carnybull Or where you being sarcastic?
@danbunting @carnybull Stunning? Predictable more like
@wadwellington Did somebody say 'Viagra and casinos'?? Wohooooo!
So what if he denies it? He had a trial. He's hardly going to admit it
..."if you rape somebody you may go to prison for years and you'll be known as a rapist for the rest of your life"

@JardyShannon You need to be patient grasshopper. Contouring is an art
@Sarah_and_dog I'm cool like Steve McQueen + Alex McQueen divided by a sit-on lawnmower. Beat that
@Sarah_and_dog Fair enough. I tried
@Sarah_and_dog So you like Jaws, cricket and rugby? Fancy going for a drink? ;)
@seanjones11kbw He went mad and threw a teleprinter at me
@seanjones11kbw I dreamt I was part of a 1980's boiler room scam. I had to confess to my boss I knew nothing about currency trading
@Sarah_and_dog I'm surprised your ex failed to appreciate your Jaws knowledge. Rare quality in a girl
@chrisdaleoxford Either way he definitely needs pants
@Sarah_and_dog I liked Richard Dreyfuss' face during that clip. Sort of screamed "can we go home now please?"
@JJ_brum @Barrister79 Sorry. I was in a bad place. I love Judaism. Good army
@JardyShannon Piss off. Seriously. Im angry as a bastard. And this accounts getting deleted. No more Boundering. Goodbye cruel world
'Life' even. Dammit. I cant even make a valed threat without messing it up
And if its my like that takes the hit then someone is going to be spanked in public. Trousers down. The works
Right load of tell tale tits on Twitter today. Careless talk costs lives
@helen_trotter Ah, thats why I recognise him. Don't know him though. It really is the best law school though. Only the best are admitted ;)
@helen_trotter Just looked him up. I massively recognise him but I'm not sure where from. I don't know him properly though. Why?
@helen_trotter I was Nottingham. Qualified in July. It rained.
@helen_trotter We were called at the same time at the same Inn. But i didn't go to Cambridge. Look at you! Pump Court though? Tax?
@helen_trotter Haha!
@helen_trotter "Smoooooth operatorrrrrr..."
@helen_trotter Judging by your photo Id say you're younger than me
@helen_trotter Sounds ace. Wasnt it a song by Pulp too?
@helen_trotter Okay. I forgive you. Is it better than Stratford?
@JardyShannon Whatever
@helen_trotter Dont knock mile end
@JardyShannon No its fucked. I hate you and want to die
I think therefore I'm a massive nob. Discuss. And go forth and love thy neighbour
There really is a great deal of profound bollocks on my Twitter TL today.
.@mkaplanPMP I thought Judaism was all a bit religious. Marrying your relatives and stamping on light bulbs to celebrate
@Barrister79 Haha! Really? Oh christ
@BartonBank @Ditzybootoo The announcer person definitely said "ghostbusters" but its a film about talking guinea pigs. And its rubbish
@MissBickerstaff She's not happy. The two boys are sleeping and all she wants to do is wash them but they keep growling. She'll learn
@JardyShannon Shouldnt you be on a train?
@JardyShannon Christ! Chip pan fire?
Ghostbusters!
That was just a nag. Don't nag please, its Christmas
@JardyShannon More?
@JardyShannon Face mask? Will it make you more or less attractive? I mean it's your personality I like so its not necessarily a deal breaker
@JardyShannon Mummy's phone
Please don't send any tweets rating her out of ten. It could send her over the edge
The picture of my mum I posted yesterday wasn't my mum. It was my brother's mum. She's well pissed off and I'm in trouble.
@Ditzybootoo Yes
@jamescarragher @JardyShannon LOL! He's quite a catch. If you knew who he was...
Snow! 
@JardyShannon @jamescarragher She's 69. And she's still smokin'. Ask the log man
@WGAbroad @BartonBank @Ditzybootoo @ddz6006 @Barrister79 @metofficeScot Nothing like miserable rain at Christmas WGA
@Barrister79 Ha! Gotcha!
@BartonBank @WGAbroad @Ditzybootoo @ddz6006 @Barrister79 @metofficeScot Those clouds defo have snow in them 
@Barrister79 no I really am. The 70's thing was a joke. I'm a Midland Circuiteer. Birmingham
@Barrister79 yes I am a barrister.. Is thT good or bad? I'm 34 though
@Sarah_and_dog @jamescarragher Oh. May back out of this one. I'd recommend a lawyer. Are you rich?
@Sarah_and_dog You can't say that then not vent
@Sarah_and_dog Oh go on
@Barrister79 It's what comes of being in your 70's I'm afraid. But I still get about
@Barrister79 No. If I squint it could be snow. Or glaucoma. I don't think anywhere has snow does it?
@tara_snow @chrisdaleoxford Full of turkey I reckon
@Barrister79 Fog
@JJ_brum Christ. It's a long long time since I've seen it but my god. That is dark. Did you have a nice Christmas? Are you feeling better?
@chrisdaleoxford He's a lovely looking boy
@JJ_brum He's weird. A doll thing that comes to life darks me out
@jamescarragher @JardyShannon Is it a punishment though?
@chrisdaleoxford is that Eeyore on the far right?
@scrufflove Haha! No, not quite. A farm near Penkridge. It'll toughen her up anyway. She'll probably come out with prison tattoos
@BlunderWoman_ What did he want?
@Mr_Lancashire Ha! Can't afford a babysitter...
@tara_snow She's opposite the biggest Forest Cat you've ever seen. Hopefully he'll show her the ropes. Like Red off The Shawshank Redemption
@tara_snow They asked if I'd bought her any toys. I looked blank and said she just plays with hair bobbles and pens. Cat parent fail
@BlunderWoman_ But we do. Come on, reach out. It could be funny
@1jamiefoster Gotta love the Margaux
@BlunderWoman_ I wonder what he wants to ask you
It's Big Suze's third day in HMP Cattery. Is it a bit gay to ring up and ask how she is? She's only a baby
@jamescarragher @JardyShannon @JJ_brum @Ditzybootoo I pull birds with my watch. And that's just the white one. You'll learn...
@BlunderWoman_ Where's the straw though?
Feeling it but gotta press on
@BlunderWoman_ Strawberry? Lads? What sort of lads do you associate with?
Everyone's having 'a nap' so I'm about to demolish this decanter. See you on the other side #TannersPort 
Good thing about being a barrister is that you don't need a mirror to make your party hat look good. I imagine I look like Richard III
@jamescarragher @JardyShannon No, she needs me today for help. If I go on strike she's in deep trouble!
@jamescarragher @JardyShannon You have. We all have!
... Sorry 'sir', in future do your homework *gloats*

@awedgewood @newlandfarm @1jamiefoster @JardyShannon Merry Christmas you Southern fairies / Northern Monkeys. Love from the Midlands!!
I've a good mind to fecking electrocute myself. That'd learn her

What a bell end 
@grumpynorthernc Suppose you would have a face like that if you suspected God had knocked your wife up
@golfbollox Ha! No, it's just I can get some peace from all the nagging and aggressive hoovering

@BlunderWoman_ They do make excellent TV viewing
@BlunderWoman_ Quite. He's always been one. Droughts, tsunamis, no snow...
@BlunderWoman_ Gotta feeling God has rain in mind
And Saville dealt with a core incident that lasted one day

@Ditzybootoo @WGAbroad next you'll be telling me you've never seen Breaking Bad! Wait, you've never seen it have you?

@pjm1kbw Haha! Maybe...
@pjm1kbw About time they caught up :)
@pjm1kbw I think the more conservative opponents think churches will become full of men in leathers and indian head dresses
@pjm1kbw I'm completely not bothered about the issue one way or the other. Suppose if gay people want to get married then let them
Not the only load of rubbish he's listening to, some would say #desertislanddiscs @pjm1kbw
@Lodgie_ ha! If He's under my bed I'm calling the police
@WGAbroad He sounds insufferable. I bet he has an electric guitar and a tambourine
@Lodgie_ I'm perplexed by his explanation of finding God. How does that happen? Why hasn't it happened to me? How come I was left out? Argh!
Not Christian rock? FFS #desertislanddiscs
@aspinallmiles @Ditzybootoo @jbell_counsel Must make a note of that
@Ditzybootoo @jbell_counsel @aspinallmiles She likes it though. She's intrigued
@Ditzybootoo @jbell_counsel @aspinallmiles He's not. He's a cad and a bounder
@Ditzybootoo @jbell_counsel @aspinallmiles Apparently only humans and dolphins fall in love but I refuse to believe it

@jamescarragher It's okay, I've made her a nativity scene with cut out pictures of celebrities in a shoe box. Took me all last night
@aspinallmiles Ha! Sorry...
@aspinallmiles Sounds like fun. Posh jurors though I imagine
@aspinallmiles @TheCriminalBar No. Sounds far away. Dorchester has a CC? Is there crime in Dorchester? Apart from OAP's crashing cars?
@aspinallmiles @TheCriminalBar if there's a risk they'll interfere with the jury / witnesses then I can't see a judge has much choice
@aspinallmiles @TheCriminalBar only over lunch though
@aspinallmiles @TheCriminalBar The jury had nowhere to go so everyone bumps into each other in M&amp;S so he just remands them
@aspinallmiles @TheCriminalBar I know a judge who RIC's some defendants over lunch because of the lack of separate facilities

@JardyShannon Yes but believe it or not I didn't take the trouble to check your details. I've told everyone you're 19
@JardyShannon Okay. If you say so. Don't get your knickers in a twist. You sure?
@JardyShannon Really? Thought you were 19?

@JardyShannon Just had to check the sexual offences act to make sure I'm not guilty of a criminal offence by posting that. And I'm not!
@JardyShannon What's wrong with the love between a man and a chicken? If gays are legal I don't see the problem
@JardyShannon What?
@golfbollox @BlunderWoman_ Hahaha! It's loving it
Happy birthday darling 
@BlunderWoman_ @golfbollox Hahaha! LMFAO! Nooooo though
@BlunderWoman_ @golfbollox Link, link, link....
Like it when Twitter makes me laugh. Lot of funny people out there
@BlunderWoman_ @golfbollox Haha! Excellent
@golfbollox @BlunderWoman_ Hahaha. Fuck
@golfbollox @BlunderWoman_ no, I haven't. Can you post it or will it lead to you being interviewed under caution?
@BlunderWoman_ @golfbollox Jesus! What you doin for your birthday?
@golfbollox @BlunderWoman_ LOL! Rimming a chicken? Some people have all the luck...
@Bobby_T_Steele Excellent heavy guitar action!
@BlunderWoman_ @golfbollox I run a hospital for AIDS goats. You can donate. I just need full name and the last 3 digits from security strip
@BlunderWoman_ @golfbollox It's curable now though. Unless it's the bad AIDS
@golfbollox @BlunderWoman_ AIDS
Yeah! Fucking Metallica! Post watershed sweary Twitter! "EXIT LIGHT. ENTER NIGHT!"
.@RealMaaviPoet I think @David_Cameron is well qualified to talk about the loss of a child
@chrisdaleoxford LOL!
@chrisdaleoxford Parents' hound ate my Mother's glasses. I suggested they put her to sleep but she's been given another chance
"Crime has fallen by 20%" Straight faces everyone
Am I old fashioned or is our prime minister calling the leader of the opposition a "waste of space" a bit cuffy? #PMQs
@rawlimark @ddz6006 nice
Good job it wasn't The Flintstones joke
Think I got that last joke wrong
@neillyfabi @janh1 Very good!
@janh1 @neillyfabi Ha! Yes it is a naval base. Clever clogs
@neillyfabi @janh1 What's long, hard and full of seamen?
@Ditzybootoo She's back. Her tail's massive so she's either been fighting or fending off Pervy man cats
Gonna crack open a tin or sardines. Never fails. #FindBigSuze
@JardyShannon You sound weirdly alright
@JardyShannon I think the cat's dead. She might not be though. But she probably is so prepare yourself
@WGAbroad yeah I was but she's still not come back so I'm a little bit concerned now. Hope she hasn't headed for the main road. Squish
MISSING! Stafford ST16. I don't really care personally but I'll be in deep shit if she doesn't come home. Please RT 
@awedgewood I'll text my mum though. She does Countdown
@awedgewood You don't know better than me. Trust me. Ask anyone...
@awedgewood Do you ever give a view that's not personal?
Muted, none the same
Not suggesting for a minute that they condone the disgraceful violence
British Pakistanis are a bit mute over the massacre of school children in Pakistan
@KarlTurnerMP How will Labour ring-fence justice with no money?
@jyc_wragge_law @seanjones11kbw @emplawyers @paulmcf10 Ha!
I can understand acts of political terrorism but killing children at school isn't cricket. Pick on someone your own size #Pakistansiege
@seanjones11kbw Good JR face
Can I include 'Go-Cat' as 'home as office'?
"Who are you?" "I'm Batman..." 
@JackofKent @Graylingbuster @IanDunt As the Ghost of Christmas Present would say, "you're a silly little man..."
Those poor kids. Looking forward to Christmas. So bad
@JardyShannon @HighlandLawyer of what?
@JardyShannon @HighlandLawyer BTW I'm double-balled
@JardyShannon @HighlandLawyer Boing
@JardyShannon @HighlandLawyer Don't take the mick out of my lone ball
@HighlandLawyer @JardyShannon What can I say? I'll look after your case. But I'll nick it
It's about time we ditched the religious label. These people are violent criminals. Mass murderers
@JudgeJohnHack I have. Good scoop. Not sure it's a Purdey though. Looks Russian / Czech
@JudgeJohnHack @twitter what was he doing with it though@ was he just messing about? If so it's a bit harsh
@SmilePIease @RealMaaviPoet I'm perfect
All the tweets I sent about my ex were a joke. FFS. I don't want to fight him etc. in fact I made it all up
@scrufflove As long as she's not happy, that's all that matters. She was quick off the blocks though. Maybe she was having an affair
@scrufflove Good. I mean, I'm not a narcissist. I just can't believe she's living a happy life without me. Without ME!
@Jezhop @ChevyChase Welcome to Wally World...
He's 39!
Aha, apparently he's a bit "wet". Stupid consultant doctor. In your face
@aspinallmiles But it's not fair though. I split on the basis that I was the best she'd ever get. Then this happens
Sounds like a massive chicken
My ex is seeing a consultant surgeon. What the actual f***? Apparently he won't fight me though. He's "too smart" and "won't rise to it"
Anchovies and full-fat milk for the kitten's breakfast. What could possibly go wrong?
@Ochentaz @RealMaaviPoet Profound
@aspinallmiles ha! She's back. She's a good cat. Today won't be long. It's nearly Christmas anyway!
@aspinallmiles Never a dull moment with Suze
@aspinallmiles I feel your pain. As does Big Suze. She's disappeared which usually means she's found a hiding place to ambush me.
@aspinallmiles Drinking? School night? What happened?
@aspinallmiles Because I'm hard too. And the cat jumped on my face. Placated with milk but might as well get up!
@aspinallmiles because you're hard
Don't cry. Don't get emotional. Be more Russian... Waltz of the Flowers from The Nutcracker (Mariinsky Ballet)  
@cheekylisa32 I didn't really. That was a lie
@cheekylisa32 I used to be in the SAS but I got discharged for a bad back
@cheekylisa32 not as good as the SAS. Crash through the window, set yourself on fire then single them out and shoot them
"Shot him in the back of the head and pushed him out the door" #IranianEmbassy They don't mess about, these SAS chaps
@A_Londono90 @JardyShannon 
@mgreenMCFC But I think you're right. You can't gamble with people's lives I suppose. I talk from the safety of my kitchen!
@mgreenMCFC haha! Sorry. Cheap shot
.@mgreenMCFC Yeah suppose you could be right. Also it's 'gung-ho' not 'guns hoe'
@mgreenMCFC Eh? I didn't advocate shooting civilians
@mgreenMCFC As I say though, I take your point. But these people need to know that if you take hostages you're fucked
@mgreenMCFC a shotgun? Please
@mgreenMCFC These people are cowards. They haven't the balls to shoot anybody
@mgreenMCFC That's why he should be arrested
@awedgewood lol!
@awedgewood Don't knock 'Extremely Dangerous Logging HD'
@awedgewood Hahaha!
@awedgewood I like 'When Dogs Run Off'. Edge of your seat stuff
@awedgewood LOL
@mgreenMCFC if he was affiliated to ISIL he would have blown himself up by now. They should go in hard and put an end to it
@awedgewood Love 'When Sharks Attack'. Second only to documentaries about pirañas
@mgreenMCFC He's an idiot. He's not got a bomb. Someone should just go in and say "enough" and arrest him
@DrMarranci Hmm. I'd storm the place. Very quickly. He wouldn't have time to think
@DrMarranci If that guy has a bomb I'm a monkey's uncle but I take your point
@MrsNabokov Laphroaig
Why doesn't someone just go in and cuff him. He's obviously not going to kill anybody. He would've done it by now #sydneysiege
Dog Day Afternoon #sydneysiege
@Graylingbuster A fuck load of twat bastards
@PrisonUK What were you in for?
@Andrew182651 haha!
Why is the MOJ banging on about male rape? I'm surprised they've got the money to fund these initiatives given the string of High Ct losses
@MissMercy28 Very good railway station
@MissMercy28 Don't knock Crewe
@LegalCheek_Tom @MetroUK It really is
@MetroUK @LegalCheek_Tom What the actual fuck?
@awedgewood @graarchen Yes, I suppose if he'd been a more effective suicide bomber...
@graarchen Can't go wrong with a .50 cal. Hostage takers need time. Best thing is to go in quick and hard.
@graarchen Although people with Bomb form tend to spend most of their lives in prison but I speculate. Just hope it ends well
@AdamWagner1 LOL!
@AdamWagner1 @prospect_uk I thought the HRA 1998 was unnecessary but I don't understand the point of repealing it. Gotta go forward not back
@Andrew182651 They could shoot him in the balls?
@graarchen Ah, okay. I see...
Fuckin ell: four armed men have entered apartment in western city of #Ghent and police have blocked off a wide perimeter around the area”
.@graarchen He's in a shop with plate glass windows. You'd think they could get a shot. There's only one bloke
Can't they just shoot him? #sydneysiege
@jamescarragher @Justin_Gau Sorry mate, I've made myself laugh now. I'm very childish. Ignore me
@jamescarragher @Justin_Gau Your wife's looking tasty
... and not the Royal Engineers Christmas party
Just heard someone say after a lengthy applause, "to say I'm blown away is perhaps inappropriate". Please tell me it was X-Factor...
@MChawlaQC WTF? Dear me...
@Chris_Challis ha! excellent!
@Chris_Challis Was he fit? It's a fair question
@Chris_Challis Yeah, maybe I should
@tim_forte @BBCRadio4 Ha ha!
@tara_snow Listening to a programme on R4. I'm very liberal. But men who think they're women sounds more like mental illness than lifestyle
@Ditzybootoo maybe. I dunno. Nice pic BTW!
So why not say, "I'm a bloke called Sue. I know it's weird. Sorry. Quite funny though" Rather than pretending you're actually a woman
It's like if I said I wanted to be a cat. Meowing, wandering round on all fours and tearing the curtains doesn't make me more of a cat
It's no problem to most people, but you are still a man
I'm setting the record straight now. If you are a girl but want to be a man you're still a girl
@tim_forte @BBCRadio4 LOL! "What... is your favourite colour...?!"
@awedgewood @BBCRadio4 nothing. God! You're always having a go! I'm going to bed to listen to some grunge on my CD player
@tim_forte @BBCRadio4 Tim the Enchanter?
Like school children
"The Torah tells us this land belongs to us". Oh do be quiet. Were these particular Jews not taught to share? @BBCRadio4
@ShanghaiSid @BuzzYorkshire LOL! Brilliant
@BuzzYorkshire @ShanghaiSid 
Tune @BBCRadio2
"We're painting our bathroom, can you play us something off the soundtrack to Hercules?" Don't colour over the edges will you? @BBCRadio2
@PegFluffGlenn @BBCGQT A moat. Of course! I'm on it...
Dear @BBCGQT, I have a number of Triffids which keep escaping and killing the neighbours. Can the panel suggest a way of keeping them in?
@JardyShannon mmm, Strongbow
@JardyShannon No, you lack that Irish tan
@JardyShannon I told you I was a gay murderer but you said we could get through it
@JardyShannon Only if your parents pay and we can go to South Africa for the honeymoon
@JardyShannon I'm not a gypsy though. I'm an upper middle class member of the establishment featuring in Who's Who and Viz
@eccles_terry @ShanghaiSid Rabbit bumming an angel?
@tim_forte I feel sorry for Nigel. He's doing his best. He must pick up the newspaper everyday and think, "shit, not again"
@BASCnews @Lodgie_ @MailOnline Pillock
@WGAbroad it's good but she sounded a bit sadly obsessed. I bet he's banging his head against the wall now though. Fail
@WGAbroad Sarah Millican. It's a bit dark actually. She had a really bad divorce. Now playing the theme from Superman!
@tara_snow @BartonBank @CrimBarrister I bet his only regret is he didn't spent that last seven grand on a really good Margaux. Legend
Haha! Frog Chorus. I. Love. This. #desertislandsdiscs
MASSACRE! Why God, WHY! 
@tara_snow No. She doesn't get her present until her birthday. She's devious, as you can see. She feels and shakes etc
@ObiterJ I like the Queen, I like Phil the Greek and I like Harry. They're all interesting. William and Kate though. Yawn...
@Andrew182651 She does have nice legs. It's undeniable

@tara_snow Kate's irritating. She's too perfect. Someone should hack their phones
I'm a royalist but William, Kate and George are sooo dull.
@JardyShannon I can't instil discipline so she's just a wild purry beast
@JardyShannon At least you don't have big Suze trying to sleep on your face
Nobody thanked us for our crime fighting
@Ditzybootoo @McDermottQC @BartonBank @helen_trotter @merludqc Oh god, that's amazing!
@wadwellington Ten pounds
Cats boys! Get 'em 
@JardyShannon Did you just say "ONE KILO"?
@tara_snow ha! I'm talented but too tall to play any one of the seven. It's bloody discrimination if you ask me
.@tara_snow I might start a claim against my local theatre because they turned me down for the part as 'Dopey' because I'm 6'4"
@tara_snow It's PC gone mad. If you're a dwarf, life's tough. I can't get comfy in economy on a plane because I'm tall. I deal with it
@tara_snow I no
@tara_snow Haha!
@tara_snow Yes. As in, better to fight and lose than settle in a case which sets that sort of precedent
@tara_snow I do get confused by Twitter!
@tara_snow Sorry *face palm*. They should've fought it and lost not settled
@tara_snow Sorry, i thought you were responding to another tweet. They prosecute their own cases under statute?
@Mr_Lancashire @TripeUK LOL! Just spotted!
@tara_snow Re theft?
@honeygirl1307 'Yet' being the operative word. Biding his time...
@Mr_Lancashire @TripeUK Big one, front row middle
@honeygirl1307 Waiting for the moment to pounce...
@Lodgie_ I heard that the PO were offering FA as an alternative to theft but how could they ever prove theft without dishonesty?
@Lodgie_ Interesting. Thanks. Clearly many were driven to act unlawfully because otherwise they'd go bust
I think I'd have told them to stick false accounting up their bums and run a theft trial in front of the jury @Lodgie_
@Lodgie_ I feel sorry for those concerned because in law they had no defence to false accounting but to prosecute them in the circumstances?
Who, exactly, is running Post Office Legal Services? FFS
Post Office settles claim brought by a midget who couldn't reach the chip and pin
150 sub-post masters prosecuted for false accounting because the computers were faulty
@Ditzybootoo @tara_snow @WGAbroad There was no reason why that shouldn't have worked. Anyway, if you wear decent wellies you're not earthed
@Ditzybootoo @tara_snow @WGAbroad you don't need one. Harvest cable from the lamps around the house then tape them together
