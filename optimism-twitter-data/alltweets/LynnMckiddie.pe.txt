Goodnight tho.<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm so sick and tired of even waking up anymore.. Nobody truly understands it.
If you EVER make a joke or any type of rude and low comment about somebody being raped.. Then you clearly need the shit beat out of you.
This makes my heart drop.. It's so messed up that this is how bad school can truly get for people.<FACE WITH COLD SWEAT><PENSIVE FACE> 

Me: 
I ripped every last piece of you out of my smile..
I can't handle much more of this
Why am I even here anymore?
This summer is going to be horrible.. I can already tell.
I want some McDonald's.<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE>
Tomorrow is going to be so hard and I'm not sure if I'm ready to handle it.
I want so far away from Michigan.
I'm so physically and mentally exhausted its ridiculous.

With my very last choir concert being tomorrow and all of this bs.. I can't handle it.
But if I told you I loved you would It make you wanna stay?
I'd break my bones just to heal your pain.

@Mitzy_dempsee ???

if they leave, fuck 'em.
Just like that.. I'm crawling back to you just like you said I would.
Your lips taste like sangria..<SMIRKING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I could be bleeding to death and I would still be the one to ask if you were the one that was okay.. Sad.. So sad.
I don't care how long we haven't talked or what has happened in the past.. If it's an emergency.. Then I will be there for you.
I love how people that have never met me and have never been in my life love to judge me and tell me who I am. It's great.
Very thankful for the amazing people in my life.<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è

I miss your voice so much.
High school is where dreams go to die.

One day your going to realize how much you hurt me and how much damage you have caused and then regret it all.

don't lead me on and waste my time.
I don't ever wanna hear another voice calling me baby on the other side of the phone..#shotgunrider

My eyes don't shed tears but they bawl when I'm thinking about you.

I don't even know who you are anymore.
@cortster504 lmao random?!
If your over me then I guess I should just move on too
Someday when I stop loving you..
You have lost your mind but you will always be my hero.
Little do you know I'm breaking down while your sound asleep.
Can we just skip to the part where everything is okay and I'm happy again?
We all have our own demons and horrors to fight but how can I win when I'm paralyzed?
I am literally going to miss this so much..<PENSIVE FACE><BROKEN HEART> 
You must really think your cool for doing and talking about drugs. <UNAMUSED FACE><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèª
One day I'm going to wake up and this won't hurt as badly.. But for right now.. Nothing feels okay.
You will always win this tug of war because I'm no longer strong enough.
Take a breather and tell yourself is going to be okay and move on.
I just want you to be happy whether it's with me or without me.
Have you ever missed somebody so much that you start to physically hurt?
Do you even understand how hard it has been since you have been gone?
It will never be possible to be friends with somebody that your in love with.
I don't know who I am without you. Which is plain out scary.
What if I told you I still loved you.. Would it make you wanna stay?
Nothing is more painful then hearing that your best friend is suicidal or seeing scars on their body because of self harm.
I wish I could say I'm over it all and that I'm okay but then I'd be lying to you and myself.
Truth is..you will always be the first person I call when something exciting or bad happens..<PENSIVE FACE>
@Mitzy_dempsee well shit.. Why aren't we attending these things?!
She's crying now. 
But she will laugh again.
I love this 
It used to be us against the world but now we're against each other it's nothing but a constant war.
Time was supposed to make this right again.
I don't even understand raves.. They look fun as hell and amazing af but I don't understand the concept of them..<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FLUSHED FACE>

I still find it horrible that somebody can hate themselves so much to the point where the harm themselves or take their own life.
Does it ever really get better or do we just get better with coping with the pain?
I have been through so much more than whys people think or know about.
I have a war going on in my mind and I just want it to stop.
Take me to Neverland and let's forget about reality forever.
I hate Monday's.
I have never understood why people did drugs over a heartbreak of break up all together.. Until now.
If you had to be inside my head for a night.. You'd go insane.
Something has really gotta change ASAP.
I honestly just miss the way I used to be.. I miss being so independent and okay with being alone. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
