Haven't seen a team get beat 7-0 in a while, today's most probably the day
Scolari must be crying
Six nil, bye Brazil
Why is Brazil now playing good? Too little too late
There's gonna be riots in Brazil after this game, I tell you this now
@Tami_Omotilewa Haven't seen him take a penalty
I can't even deal with these tweets.
How can some people say but Neuer in strike to bang in a goal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
No sympathy from Germany.
This is most definitely gonna be a Germany vs Holland final
29th minute: 5-0 
@Tami_Omotilewa Loooooool
@Tami_Omotilewa It hurts doesn't it Tami?
Kroos is most probably gonna hat-trick in the first half
@Tami_Omotilewa Nah this match man....I'm upset, the older Brazil (Ronaldo, Rivaldo etc) would be so ashamed of this team
Neymar is gonna strangle every man after this match
Germany disrespect.
I predict 10 - 0 by the end of this
Ghana is better than Brazil.
Germany drew 2-2 with Ghana
Germany is banging Brazil
We're better <WINKING FACE>
Four goals in six minutes
End the match please.
Five nil
Thiago Silva and Neymar are literally the team. If they were there it'd still be 0-0.
I'm crying cause this is too peak
FOUR NIL NAH THIS IS SHIT
Germany is bullying, this ain't fair 3-0.
NEYMAR DID NOT DIE TO HAVE HIS TEAM RAPED LIKE THIS

Dempsey is too dangerous
@VictorMgbeike Nani is the poundland version of Ronaldo I swear down
@jumairaauddin Lool its better for us, would you rather have a whole school year or small breaks in between to get away from annoying people
@UnusualFactPage @TheFactsBook I'm pretty sure the picture says China, not Japan
@jumairaauddin That's almost every country except for us cause we get half terms and stuff, they just have a whole school year no breaks

I bet you're Ghana laugh eventually 
@_NarhTasha We will not. That is final.
@_NarhTasha I'm glad you know your place Tasha
Deadest game.
This juju is taking its time to activate man

@Yetundx_ Do yourself a favour and never say this again babe
Ghana's match will be better than this one, In Jesus Name
@Yetundx_ <SMIRKING FACE><WINKING FACE>
There Odemwingie is
@Yetundx_ please <UNAMUSED FACE><CONFUSED FACE> 
I swear I can hear the Nigerian audience playing "I have a father who will never ever fail me"
@ThatGuyAkins No. Just you.
I swear Dejagah is the Asian version of Bale
Lol Odemwingie must've fled, I ain't seen him in time
Nigeria should just do 10 strikers and score already
This half better be good
@Bridget_Ao @Yetundx_ That is a lie from the pit of hell, Ghana will not lose
Lol if your country isn't even in the world cup you shouldn't even be on Twitter right now
I beg this match don't end in a goalless draw
@Flarednostrilss @Yetundx_ I'll make sure you wont
The ball's been out more than in, the audience even have more ball possession than these players
@Yetundx_ Ikr, probably the worst first half since the start of the world cup
Let me just savour this moment of Nigerian pars because when Ghana plays I know we're gonna get gunned in the TL
@Tami_Omotilewa <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WINKING FACE>
Nigeria is playing in a 4-1-9 formation.
So effective
That was the worst goal kick ever.
I can do better
Just imagine Nigeria and Ghana in the final. That would literally be the decider forever.
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@warhead_burial @SomewhereinLDN_ My man said heaven
@Tami_Omotilewa Watch
Nigeria is gonna win 3 - 1
Ronaldo is probs gonna hadouken every man in the changing rooms
Sorry Portugal
Neuer is just too sick a goalie
I swear Ghana better not score one goal, get gassed and start azontoing and then lose, they always get content with one goal
@Tami_Omotilewa @ZellOcho_ @JayCostello9 I beg you leave <CONFUSED FACE>
@Tami_Omotilewa @ZellOcho_ @JayCostello9 Lol please shush, Nigeria will suffer
Portugal got Smacked up 

Whos next ?”

Everybody's getting injured man
@AyoSango_ Like you
@_naomielliott @Tami_Omotilewa you're doing well so far Naomi
He should've banged it in straight away
@VictorMgbeike ah that makes sense
Why is it oezil, I thought it was just özil?
@VictorMgbeike Can you shush plis
Germany's defence is too solid, but that free kick would've gone in asap if the wall didn't save it
Portugal are tryna force some type of set piece
@VictorMgbeike @Tami_Omotilewa @SomewhereinLDN_ Lol this is getting funnier
@Tami_Omotilewa @SomewhereinLDN_ Lol dark race, so funny
@Tami_Omotilewa @SomewhereinLDN_ So you admit there are blick Nigerians?
Ronaldo's about to descend into depression with his teammates playing ball like this
Lol I wanna see what Piers Morgan has to say about this match
@SomewhereinLDN_ I don't even know why I'm laughing at these blick jokes, there's always a darky Ghanaian and Nigerian somewhere
Second half - here comes the pain
@Feyi_LDN If he was Portugal would not be losing three nil <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> &amp; Looool aight then wait for  Nigeria and Ghana
@Tami_Omotilewa @VictorMgbeike Ghana's gonna beat USA I just know it, who's Naija playing?
@Feyi_LDN Loool he's sick but he ain't superman &amp; you gotta start watching it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Feyi_LDN Looool they're relying on Ronaldo and he can't do everything, especially against Germany, they've been a sick team from day 1
"@AyoSango_: Knock out stage is gonna be crazy" can't even stress how true this is
@Tami_Omotilewa @SomewhereinLDN_ are you a witch? My friend shot op
@Feyi_LDN Loooool Portugal is getting battered 3 - 0 and the first half just finished <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> when's Naija playing
@VictorMgbeike yeah you're right, but the worse thing is that the whole team relies on him but play dead ball
World Cup: The tournament where everything is unpredictable.
Ronaldo can't do shit right now
Portugal its all over, don't cry don't beg plis
@Tami_Omotilewa @_naomielliott <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> loooool omds
@VictorMgbeike Well he got ballon d'or, I guess he made the best of what he had, I guess that's why he's so good. The others should learn
Portugal is losing composure faster than they are the match
@Feyi_LDN looool you should watch the Germany match <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't know why they're arguing with the ref is not like he can unsend him off, he's gone
Naahh Pepe deserved that, why would you do that tho?
Man got a red card! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I swear Eder looks Congolese
Peak, if only they weren't confused
Sorry Portugal
That head was powerful
TWOOOOO NILLL GERMANY
Oooo that almost went in!
@khushboo_x Yeah yeah true, usually nobody plays good in the first half
@khushboo_x Loool for real? This is Bosnia's like first goal ever
@khushboo_x They'd been playing quite good the whole match so it wasn't a surprise
Bosnia actually has that solid defence
But that was too lucky though
Swear Messi didn't even look at that ball
@MelBasquiat @jaydalouise Snapchat shegged us, the video quality looks like diarrhoea
Messiiiiiiiiiiiiii
That was so close
That was quick
@VictorMgbeike @Tami_Omotilewa I think they're just gonna make it king cause he'll be seen as more important that Elizabeth or something
Finally we're underway
@damidinihio Lol gonna be mad hard for England, smooth ride for us
@damidinihio Lol come talk to me when England gets out of the group stages <WINKING FACE>
Can they just start the game?
@damidinihio I saw it coming &amp; Holland is a sick team. Whereas England...
@damidinihio Please don't lie to yourself, that will not be the score
@Tami_Omotilewa *mate &amp; 2
@Tami_Omotilewa 1. Should've been at least a little more specific matev2. I literally just wanna see him fight his own team <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> be mad funny
@Tami_Omotilewa I know he is, he was never really shit tbh, I just wanna see him fight somebody like Pirlo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
England vs Italy - I wanna see what kinda of stunts Balotelli is gonna pull, I wanna see him slump somebody today
Casillas must be in so much pain tbh
What makes it funnier is that they can't even score a second goal
@damidinihio 5 - 1 what you saying now bitch?
Five. They are gone. Robben has smashed it
Spain leave
Sweetest revenge ever tbh
World Cup 2010 had nothing on this game
Sergio Ramos is mad annoying, he's a huge threat
Holland cruficied Spain. End of.
Four! Banged them. Done.
@Tami_Omotilewa I am now, I was putting some socks on and leaf me to be happi
We can't relax tho, Spain's attack is getting better by the second, it would've been close if that wasn't offside
@Tami_Omotilewa Fam I was upstairs my dad shouted SNIJDAAAAAA like a typical aff so I assumed
YESSS OFFSIDEEEEE IN YOUR FACE
De Jong, we are banging them
This is revenge from the 2010 World Cup finals I know it, Spain is feeling the burn
Couldve been a third, jheez offside though

@Billy_Arter Ramos is still the hero, without his goal it would've been all over from the start
It's almost as if Real wanted Athletico to feel like they were winning before shitting on their glory because they banged these goals <SOCCER BALL><SOCCER BALL>
@SomewhereinLDN_ @toniyates_ FAM I would've got that certi A* if I read this before the exam <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Athletico must've been happy when Casillas couldn't save that ball.
They celebrated way too early....waaaay too early.
Meh, their own fault
Wait, did man just score AGAIN?! 
Real Madrid is actually taking the piss <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The game is over Atl might aswell leave the stadium now
And they've completed, Ramos, Bale and Marcello, Athletico is finished
Extra time, 30 more minutes
SERGIO RAMOS SAVED USSSSS

Athletico is gonna win at this rate

Complaining and correcting are very different
Complaining will only damage you.
Correcting will fix the other person.
The fact that one chapter of my life is about to end is so sad. Really don't wanna leave secondary school.

@Tami_Omotilewa @piersmorgan wait wait wait? What are you? Get out of Earth please <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Tami_Omotilewa Regardless of the fact that that's true I still dislike him
This referee tried his best to make us lose.
DIDN'T TRY HARD ENOUGH NIGGUUUHHHHHH
@Tami_Omotilewa Still don't like him
@Tami_Omotilewa I don't like him

How can Gibbs say we're gonna celebrate now, you need to reevaluate your football career
Wenger must be gassed now 
Ramsey must feel like a god now
This win feels so sweet man, I love Ramsey so much right now
Eff Gibbs &amp; Sanogo
@LukeeKular He's about to find you
The relief
WE HAVE DONE IT! 
ARSENAL HAS DONE IT!
I swear why add one minute, you want me to die?
Fabianski you're trying to kill me
@LukeeKular @ToniannAshea Sanogo is coming for you 
I wanna hit Fabianski for that
My heart is bleeding
Should not have done that, what if Hull equalized?
I really should have bet on this game
Now all we have to do is keep Hull away from the goal and we bag this game
AAAAARRRROOOOOON RAAMSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYY YES YES YES YES YES THIS GUY
RAAAAAAAAMSEEEEYYYYYYYYY
@Tami_Omotilewa I just don't want them to end up in penalties, that never ends well
@Tommy_XVII Lol the indirects
@Tami_Omotilewa I hope you're being sarcastic...
I hope somebody does something funny in the match so they can make a new Yeet vine, I need some laughter right now
I swear, Arsenal is actually having a "who can shoot the highest" competition
Don't even know why Wenger invested his money or time in Giroud, he's making me more angry than the ref
WHY IS THIS GUY SHOOTING LIKE THE BALL'S TRYNA CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST!?
GIROUUUDDDDDD WHY
If Gibbs scored we'd be celebrating by now
These guys from Hull are bare crying like they've lost already
Come you have one chance for a win
Nah this is gonna go to extra time
Come ON. SCORE!
Sanogo could have done it for us
@VictorMgbeike Oh, bout to say, don't even care about that I just wanna Bruce Lee this referee now
@VictorMgbeike Victor? You getting twitter hacked or something?
Almost Giroud, he was gonna earn my respect back just then, playing like crap tonight
I swear down I wanna shoot this referee, how can he ignore that push like man used telekinesis on himself
NOOOOOOOOOO ALMOST
If Hull City scores I fill fly kick my dad in the left ear, watch.
Nah but this referee has been shegging us from the first minute
COME ON NOW WE HAD BETTER WIN THIS GAME NOW
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS EQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL KOSCIELNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I mean can we at least equalise
Idk I can just feel a goal coming...
I don't know who's gonna score but I just feel a goal within the next 15 minutes
Always flipping ruin chances man
Second half better be goal-filled
Why ruin a great chance guys?
"@id_shoboy: Today it's Arsenal versus the whole tl, not just hull city" can't even stress how true that is man <UNAMUSED FACE>
Is Hull's defence good, or is our attacking just slacking?
