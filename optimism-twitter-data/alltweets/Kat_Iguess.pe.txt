@MarlonValencia0 did it really destroy?
@MarlonValencia0 by what means? The dog created something too not just destroy
@MarlonValencia0 what else it can't just be us, yes we are a main cause of it but what makes nature scary fam?
@MarlonValencia0 true but suppose you let your dog into the garden and it's destroyed it, a man didn't destroy it so what's the nature of it
@MarlonValencia0 that's it???
@MarlonValencia0 here's the new question, so what is nature?
@MarlonValencia0 pros and cons about it
@MarlonValencia0 what makes nature be nature?
@MarlonValencia0 do me favor, describe the nature of nature? What makes it fascinating and bad at the same time?
Then tell me how nature is.

Take me on your flight
Gently pass on by
Bird of prey flying high in the summer sky
There is nothing that can stop my intuition
I'm a wandering musician
I'm a rider on the storm
For the ship is still a float
Relax your mind and focus
*takes deep breath*
Let me take the wheel and sail my ship as smooth as I can for the storm is short and only lasts for a while
A small storm has fallen
The winds are blowing, the waves are rising high
It's going to be fine, I'm going to be fine

Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?

Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self control

John Keats everyone <RELIEVED FACE> 
This FRQ for gov man <WEARY FACE>
Have to enjoy it just like Keats
Young John Keats
The day's a re bright and filled with pain but the night just brings a light of hope
Just get everything together and start walking on this road
Nope.... Not today. The sun is almost gone but the radiance of the moon still awaits
A purpose to continue going
I dislike this but I'm trying. 
Every time I come about this everything becomes dead but then I feel a small gain, a small purpose
Wild horses
"I watched you suffer"
I read some proms during 6th period and I must say i came across some deep stuff
"Since I've been loving you"
And if one is in the end well let new begins arise
I'm not first nor second
But nor am I last,
It may seem to be but its not
Awwww that's messed up!
