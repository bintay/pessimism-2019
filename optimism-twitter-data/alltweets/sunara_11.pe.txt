I do not like to take my contacts out at night. What. A. Fucking. Inconvenience. Bitch.
OK I'm done with tonight's segment of #insomniacthoughts
because I'm claustrophobic.
Also if I won the lottery I'd have my dream home built inside of an almost exact replica of Sandy Cheek's dome. Except mine would have vents
Also if I won the lottery I'd pay for lots of neighborhoods to have a personal daily exterminator.
If I ever won the lottery I'd give some random neighborhood free cable and internet service.

that my best friend @amaris_nichole &amp; i found each other on #Tinder and became a #Tindermatch and now msg each other via #Tinder
I almost forgot to mention in my segment of #tweetsOnTinder ...
@bitch_crvft hahaha!
Also my phone is never boring now that i have #Tinder ...
So now i make cool client friends on #Tinder ... #thankstinder
I still gotta get clients though so i even changed my #Tinder preferences to both guys and girls
However my life was getting dull again so i re-downloaded my #Tinder app &amp; decided to make it more about me ...
But that got old and awkward so i deleted #Tinder once more ... #aintnobodygottimefordat
So then i re-downloaded #Tinder and made it clear in my about me section that i was looking for clients ...
... until one day i came up with the idea to market my haircutting on #Tinder to get more clients ...
So then i deleted my #Tinder app and had better battery life on my phone (:   ...
Plus i had swiped through #Tinder so much that it just wasn't poppin no more ...  #creepyuglyboys
Then #Tinder started cutting into my life and became a bit annoying ...
I got a #Tinder as a joke with my best friend, then got addicted for about a week
Annnd now for tweets about #Tinder ...
