Vodafone promised me next day delivery. Did I get next day delivery? Did I fuck. Thx @VodafoneUK <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I feel BAD
It's just not my week. But it will get better
It's just not my week but it will get better

My Friday nights have changed since year 1. Still doing uni work and I've only actually accomplished about 5 seconds on AfterEffects.

A Mars ice-cream will make me feel better. The packaging is enough to make me have a positive mood swing.

So many strawberry laces in my mouth atm
Strawberry laces are so much nicer when you realise that they're just a string of those big lush strawberry sweets from Jill's <STRAWBERRY>
Life is just trial &amp; error constantly xxx
Maybe we're both fucked, or maybe I'm just bad luck
Pretty tree 
@taimereeves hahahaha #fame
@taimereeves bare likes
Last Train by Dawn Golden is fabulous
Ellie just guessed my dead hamster was named "goblin" and then "hikey". I did not ask her to guess
The fact that we all remember "1066" because of the advert is more interesting to me than whatever the fuck happened in 1066. #marketing
Woop
Ellie says bye to me over texts and I just ignore the goodbye and start a new subject like "OMG EL BTW" #brilliant
I want to tweet loads of Dawn Golden lyrics but they're all depressing and im in a good place so it doesn't feel right
WE WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE BABY WE JUST HAPPENED
@ellieprxce kanye west // gold digger

people buy macs because theyre cool now
I asked Ellie if we could watch Children In Need and she replied "No we can't because it's all fucking lies"
In my head it's morning until it gets dark
This album is the biggest treasure chest
It's sad but I always have the coolest nights when I'm just doing work on my own all night and listening to music and stuff
I've got you back but you're changing right in front of my eyes
Nice wear headphones but it's not great eating a packet of monster munch with them in, especially when a good song is on shuffle. Fuck
Food is nice though, loveky
I'm eating to stay alive
What if everything is a metaphor for something????
Just posted a photo 
Been to uni all day today and just finished a freelance project, oh yeahh

i feel cool
Also I love uni, I love my life, I'm getting into this coursework and I'm having the coolest night ever
Graphic design makes me fucked up. I just said "yes!" about the time period an illustrator died (it benefitted my work). Twisted as fuck

im turning into a pussy, im coughing bc the chilli doritos were too spicey
@ArranDibble hahah it's been a while now dibble! almost 4 years of lesbianism. i'll never be seen in a flat peak xxx
Kanye West is a genius
Someone in my old workplace recently found out that I am a lesbian and replied with "but she wears skirts" lololol
The clothes in River Island make me feel uncomfortable. 
I'm very cold outside but I'm very warm inside. #winterproblemz

Ellie just looked in the mirror and said "alright El?"
i dry heaved at straight sex gif

Sat with all my hair down brushed thoroughly and Ellie is cutting my hair. 
"How'd you know how to cut hair El?"
"I don't"

<EARTH GLOBE AMERICAS> 
Georgia Boon just took my phone and made a joke out of me
lol the rum
Downloading Skins with subtitles accidentally has finally paid off. Fucking trains
This girl on my course looks like Effy off Skins and it trips me out.
Naomi &amp; Emily are my OTP and when I say that I mean it in the most literate way possible
It's bedtime bitches
horrifying
its making me feel weird
i am 100% growing up
"MSN" is used in my vocabulary far more than the average 20-year-old female I think.
ellie is trying to show me up by buying me a better christmas present than i buy her #nuh
I liked a @YouTube video from @ayyonline 
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist 
@willcoburn time to celebrate!!!!!!!
I hate Liam Payne so much
TWITTER IS GOING OFF 
4 NEW FOLLOWERS
Well I am so fucking excited for Christmas now.
@ellieprxce sorry babe have 2 speak to u later xx 
I, I wanna marry you. I said I, I adore youuuuu
And I'm still in my motivationless phase. I will just have to wait until it ends
I already feel like I'm going to fail this brief because I have already wasted 1 week by doing fuck all work for it.
I like that Matt Healey refers to himself as "Matty" when speaking in third person
@ArranDibble can you imagine how good that would be? arghhh
@ArranDibble For fuck sake. I didn't even know who he was back then and I was in Reading 2013. I'm so annoyed w/ myself right now. :(
I'm the number one rock star on the planet
Reading 2015 is going to be the best one yet. I need to see The 1975 again and Chance The Rapper plese.
I think I'm going to delete all of the music off my phone and just buy Spotify. I pay for Netflix and I don't even like TV so it makes sense
Ellie is such a posh cunt that she's never even been in Home Bargains.
the grinch is so camp
@BeckyCox hahaha good im glad you agree
Cheese is just hard milk. Who would think hard milk flavoured potatoe slicesvwould be a thing?
The new John Lewis advert could be an advert for Tinder if it was slightly altered
I'm half-way through the John Lewis advert and it's spinning me the fuck out. Also, I'm assuming that the penguin dies or something.
@JoeWoodland3 hahaha when i read that tweet joe i read it in your voice in my head #bryn
Im having a nice life
Every year when the seasons change I listen to the same music as I listened to 1 year ago
I have written you down now, you will live forever
Obsession, it takes control. Obsession, it eats you whooooole
im an internet person and im not a fan of anybody who doesn't understand the concept of twitter
my fav person to teach is generally one of those 14-year-old valleys boys because they're funny and remind me of my male friends in year 10
I am so hungry
i own two cool plants and they aren't dead, it's the one thing which makes me feel like my life is on track
om i fucking love trey songz so much its happening again, i just discovered his 2012 album which i haven't listened to and it's awesome helP
i love looking at my iphone screen when it's been dead and i haven't looked at it for hours, it feels all fresh and new
an emoji just made me hungry
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist 
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist 
I need The 1975 to tour the UK. <TIRED FACE>
I'm sick of basic bitches being told they look like Kylie Jenner just because they're posing the exact same at as her fuckin Twitter photo.
Good job lip syncing Cheryl, full of talent
I'm never gonna show someone a good song at the wrong time ever. I do not want to waste a good experience again.
Fucking plastic
Watching Alice &amp; Wonderland on a Saturday night and I'm having the best night.
I wish I would stop fucking forgetting every thought that I have after 10 seconds
I have hundreds of interesting things to say
Changed the saturation on my Twitter photo #cool
Ellie is really good at design technology
Not only the gayest thing that I've made, but also one of the shittest things I've ever made. I am… 
Swaggy work attire 
Gavin &amp; Stacy is set in 2010(ish), yeah? Gavin is trying to ring Stacy but she isn't answering because she's angry. Just text her, knob
@ellieprxce cunts ain't they? And we love nessa
My bad moods are better than my old good moods
It's a horrible scene
Also Gavin &amp; Stacey episode 1 ruined that song by The Kooks for everyone who's ever watched it. I actually like Gavin &amp; Stacey but nah.
Bit weird would be
Episode 1 of Gavin &amp; Stacy is shit. It wasnt thought out right. He didnt know she smoked but she has a picture of him on her bedside table??
I don't think I'm gonna go for the walk after work that I have sadly been looking forward to all week. Cwtchy night with X Factor, yes. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>

stressing thinking about having to try and learn after effects and make a fucking video before work tomorrow
Haven't been this excited for Christmas in years, so exciting, too happy, OVERWHELMED WITH HAPPINESS AND FESTIVITY.
If Adobe After Effects downloads before tomorrow then I can maybe make the deadline for this extra brief tomorrow. It's 0.3% atm. Brilliant.
Im on the laptop again and it feels good
How can I still feel this happy when I have so much work and so much uni work idk thanks world for being cool to me atm
Ahhhhhhhhh
Dubstep 3000
Chance the rapper is my idol

sat in my maesycwmmer bed with fuck loads of ulcers drinking orange juice w/ ice and lemonade feels so nostalgic for some reason
life is so awesome and i have a gf who lends me her macbook when i dont have one &lt;333333 #luv
Yesterday Ellie tricked me into asking the woman in McDonalds drive through if I could have some syrup.
Being stubborn in my situation right now means not eating a McDonalds which is right next to me until she comes back and im so hungry. Ffs
I hate Ellie
OH MY GOD BABE ANGE HAS GONE MAD THIS TIME

Ellie just asked the McDonalds woman to put Big Mac sauce on my cheese burger and I'm gonna put mozzarella dippers inside it too. EXCITED. <HAMBURGER>
Tonight is going to be the most perfect night ever anyway
Last night was an experience. It wasn't a good experience, it was just a blur. I am not doing anything next Halloween. TimeHop remind me.
@BeckyCox lord byron was a fucking prick
everybodys fucking stealing off me, i am not having a house party again lmfao scatty cunts
@willcoburn @_J_Hicks_ hahaha I think so to be honest. I enjoyed it though, nostalgic
@BeckyCox @s0phdof @SadieKwan hahaha yes
@willcoburn @_J_Hicks_ lmao this doesn't look like a real convo, it sounds like a screenshot to advertise AIM or something
Just took a dip in Pepsi town.
Oh look, I'm a fucking zombie again. 
So weird being in the McDonalds in St Mary street sober and not at 4am.
Today could be a good day.
LET'S SPEND THE REST OF SUMMER STONED, AND WE'LL WAKE UP BY THE WINTER WITHOUT THE MEMORY OF THE SUN AND THERE'LL BE NOTHING TO MOAN ABOUT
@ellieprxce i'm not gonna let you run away
@ellieprxce is this about me..
@ellieprxce is this aimed at me?:/
@ellieprxce is this aimed at me??
@ellieprxce is this aimed at me?
@ellieprxce is this aimed at me
My Halloween experience always ends up being shit so idk why I get so excited each year.
That girl from Him &amp; Her is hot and that makes me sure that im going to watch every episode on Netflix
sometimes i forget how much i love blink182
SO GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY WE NEED TO BE LIKE THEM
they hate the trends and think it's fucked to care, it's cool when they piss people off with what they wear
i like the ones who say they listen to their punk rock, i like the kids who fight cause that's how they were brought up
We're bigger than memphis, you only exist when I want you to
Chance, acid rapper
The 1975s Medicine artwork is awesome. Same branding but with wild photography instead of black on black. I will miss the spot UV though
The ultimatum's a ridiculous joke but I'm gonna pick the option that allows me to smoke, but I'm alright, yeah it's alriiiiight
Making myself a curry at 4:18am

Katy Perry, put your boobs away you scatty bitch
I only brought 3, what you looking at me for?
10. damn. days. and all i've got to show for it is shoes and shows and chauffeurs and road rage
Fuck, me &amp; Ellie are waiting 'till Saturday to listen to The 1975s song (for various reasons) and it just got released 10 mins ago. :(
... And we'd have to eat it. Horrible tiny paedophiles apples with bruises and dents. 30p.
Remember when Jamie Oliver fucked up everybodys break in primary? The caretaker (who was later found a paeodphile) bought the grossest fruit
The inside of my mouth feels swollen. I've either of got ebola or I've eaten too much monster munch
TimeHop is for nostalgia and nostalgia's original meaning is "homesick" FOR FUCK SAKE HOW HAVE I HAD A WHOLE CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF??????
I don't think #recycleyourlaughter is that good of a slogan for TimeHop actually
Maybe no one laughs but I've got TimeHop so at least i'll be laughing. In 1 year, and then 2, and then 3. #recycleyourlaughter
I only tweet about people ok because something funny happens and I just wanna share it in the virtual world. Laughing is the best medicine
@taimereeves I know I tweet about Ellie k but when people tweet about their bfs im like "lol" abit but yours makes me go "awwww yay cute!!!"
ID STILL PICK MY FRIENDS OVER YOUUUUUU were everything I wanted and I just can't finish what I started who's going to see new found glory
