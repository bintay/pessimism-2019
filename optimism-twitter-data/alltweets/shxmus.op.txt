@_zootsuit Hahahaha I was drunk too! Haven't been in that state in ages!!
@_zootsuit It was the right thing to do, at the right time.. I'd lose my voice doing it again any night of the week!
I still don't think my throat has recovered from screaming along to 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' at Eves the other weekend
I think it was a pretty bad idea getting a PS4 in the middle of study leave, lol there goes any intentions of studying #priorities
Just spoke to my mum on the phone and it just doesn't feel right<PERSEVERING FACE>

We live in the moment, not the past and certainly not the future.
All the small time actors I've met believe they're destined for a greater cause and are the next best thing. Pretentiousness at its best.

It's great that after so many years Family Guy still hasn't lost its comedy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Constantly having to find and generate things to interest you is in itself, very boring
Life is even more of a challenge when you get bored of the same things very easily
Why is it whenever I have to sleep on the couch it's always roasting? Literally having to peel myself off the couch anytime I want to move

Documentaries dominate my attention span

It doesn't even make sense, how can a house out in a village have better internet speeds than a house in a town?
I still can't understand how I had a faster download speed in Coylton than what I've got in Ayr? BT capping internet speeds?
Someone drink with me tonight <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE>

@jordangrahamx I think we've all had a stint under that thunder cloud, and I wouldn't waste my time hahaha<FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>
@jordangrahamx jackpot! I was so angry with her, seriously so off-putting

Told a certain teacher what I was planning on doing when I left school and all she could ask me was "yeah but what if you don't get in?"

@laurensc0tty ask to do a N5 Numeracy, it's an open book test but it does show that you have some competency in N5 maths
@laurensc0tty you'd do well with something in society with a modern language, foreign politics?
@laurensc0tty I decided to leave and then what I wanted to do came to me, have u met with the careers advisor???

@ginger_b0wlcut I had no idea that she could get down to the barriers from the stage :( I learned my lesson with that for next time too!
@ginger_b0wlcut yeah! I was like 2 rows of people away from the stage barrier, but I couldn't get past them :(
I wish my big brother just dropped me off at my grans house, would've rather stayed at hers than my own house <UNAMUSED FACE>

@ginger_b0wlcut you'd have to camp out for that! Front row ppl in 2013 were like a brick wall, couldn't get through them!
@ginger_b0wlcut you missed big time! Though having to stand in the same spot was pretty killing :((
@ginger_b0wlcut the grinding in the crowd was pretty brutal too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ginger_b0wlcut I was there too! God there were so many funny /weird people there too! We met byron too!
@ginger_b0wlcut holy shit we were probably beside one another hahahaha I was ready to catch hypothermia to meet her hahahaha
@ginger_b0wlcut same here! Though I waited until 3am for her to come out n meet fans but she didn't :(((
@ginger_b0wlcut aww I know! I wish she done the Endless Summer tour here too <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@ginger_b0wlcut the nostalgia from watching YT videos of her in Glasgow was emotional<WORRIED FACE>

Cola - Lana Del Rey - Paradise Tour - Glasgow SECC 16.5.13 
BTD is going on repeat
I don't actually speak to other fans now :(((
I cannot wait until she tours again in the UK
I still rank seeing Lana Del Rey live at Glasgow 2 years ago one of the best nights I've ever had
Some who don't realise how lucky they are
I'm jealous of a lot of people
"Sending failed" ... g o  a w a y
Slow internet drives me up the wall, I get far too frustrated when things don't send
Someone jump in for me lolz

Made a new pal last night<VICTORY HAND>
@danielleniclex happy birthday Danielle<WHITE SMILING FACE><PARTY POPPER><BIRTHDAY CAKE> x
Her floor is a minefield of toys and pencils
Staying at my brothers house, and I've to sleep in Kaidiahs bed. Cinderella covers. An immense amount of teddies. Awww naw.
I can't stand running late, especially when it's someone else's fault
Why is it that whenever I'm in a hurry the bus is ALWAYS late
Caramel syrup mixed through a cappuccino is my favourite thing
Trying to sleep and my TV turns itself on. Smart TV isn't smart enough to understand the fact that user (me) SLEEPS at this time!!!
Deez nutz. Hah.
Omg all I can think about is the "Deez nutz" vines and I'm trying my hardest not to burst out laughing hahahaha
I want to go out n party like right now
Need to get to the careers advisor like the now, I hate application forms <PERSEVERING FACE>
Down here trying to find people to come out is a challenge
One thing I definitely miss about Coylton was that you could walk round to the school and you were guaranteed to meet someone
Dying to get out of the house, someone come a walk plssssss
Everyone is talking about this new Star Wars film and I've yet to see all of the current ones
I'm always the odd one out
I wanted peace and quiet earlier, but no, I have to listen to constant banging/things getting dropped and Kaidiahs cartoons<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>

"Roll over and die" is probably the best thought I've had all day, such a shitty mood.
Eyes are actually stinging and burning, ouch

Talk about being 'work-shy' hahaha
Just wrote my first cover letter. 
Ew.
Want to vomit, or cry.

I've not missed getting up with my alarm at 7 i'l tell ye
I probably spend more time looking for a half-decent film than I do actually watching them
Someone suggest a good film to watch on Netflix?
I'm tempted to buy tickets to Glastonbury, but the line-up last year was better
Twitter on Mobile is so much easier, but desktop seems better
I mean, £50 for lillies seems to a tad on the expensive side
Buying my mum flowers for her birthday as part of her presents, but I have no idea how reasonable florist prices are

When I get the notification that I can't watch stuff on my own Netflix account, is when I just boot everyone off the account<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
Joppa is going to get Fibre Optic this Spring. Once I move from Coylton, half decent Internet speeds become a thing. Crying.
@kirstenlogan98x okayyyy

Paying more for less? So really, you'll pay £100 for a crumb in a few decades?
Bought an easter egg and it's smaller than it was last year
Far too bored lul
me: 
Staying in Heathfield can be boring, I need friends that stay near me<CONFUSED FACE>
Everyone's watching football and I've got hee haw to do and no one to talk to
I care way too much about what people think of me
I'm not sure if materialism is a bad thing
I love looking at houses/apartments in LA and NYC <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Having an app that shows the people that unfollow you is great, bye bye <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I love my music taste, it's so varied
I hate falling asleep on a Saturday because I know when I know when I wake up I have homework to do. The 'joys' of school.
Constantly running on a short fuse now, have to stop being so angry and stressed
It really is amazing how you keep making the same mistake, over and over again
Fleetwood Mac tickets came today - June can't come quick enough!!!
Too stressed<WEARY FACE><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Nothing worse when you're rushing and everyone else is on go-slow
I love spending time with my nieces, perfect children<SMILING FACE WITH HALO>
@braddley_mackie she's such a champ it's great <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH HALO>

@evehodgexo I knew you'd say that<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I've seen children wanting less cuddles than my dog hahahaha
Having a clingy dog can be nice sometimes
Cooking shows are good too
I love food-related TV shows
Would've been amazing to have seen Depeche Mode on the Devotional Tour
I'm not an expert but that seems like a fair deal<SMIRKING FACE>
"I'll pay for your holiday completely if you help me move the TV"
I made the mistake of hating someone without knowing them, it's stupid and shouldn't be done. Ever.
Someone I've never spoke to has blocked me, lol
Admin is going to be so boring now that we're getting split up<WORRIED FACE>
Just realised something from months ago, why did I not see it then<HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
Why can't it just be Friday today<PERSEVERING FACE>
I don't possess the will to wake up today
Need plans for the weekend pls<EYES>
@_bradleyeverett course, not got the time, or care enough to worry about folk that wouldn't give you the time of day<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
But most times I won't care because the great thing about 'effort' is that it works both ways
I sometimes feel bad for not making the effort with some people
@MeganMillerr_27 u know it gurl
I want to have my pals in this weekend ha ha ha no happening <RELIEVED FACE>
Everything is too loud<PERSEVERING FACE>
I love like all the rings that The Great Frog sells <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

@chick_ziggy I still think she's a bad person, but I like her in the house

Katie is so upfront about stuff, which is admirable
I'm conflicted between who's side I'm on: Perez or Katie?

I'm such a regular in there, they know me too well
Phoned the school office and the first thing they asked me was

"I assume you're ill again today, Shane?"
What happens if you can't do a prelim, because of medical reasons?
Feel like an idiot
Would be real good if my medicine started working <CONFUSED FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE>
I miss previous school years, I miss old friends, old memories I want to relive <WORRIED FACE><WORRIED FACE>
