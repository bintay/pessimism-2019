Idk I hate having a big heart but at the end of the day it's what makes me, me. And big hearts make the world a better place
I promised myself that I would try to be more positive and so far so good
I'm the type of person that gets super excited and happy when something good happens to someone else like yes!!!!!! So happy you're happy!!!
I really do hope everyone gets everything they want and they end up happy and nothing but great things happen to everyone
It's a blessing and a curse when you really care about a lot of things and others before yourself
Slowly realizing that being nice is getting me absolutely nowhere and that sucks bc I just wanna see everyone I care about happy but... Ya..
I really cannot get over how ungrateful some people are
