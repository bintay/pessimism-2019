Midnight is when I take the next step in making my dreams come true. This is happening.
EXID's AH YEAH is <FIRE>

Shout out to @7uic3 he a real nigga. No judgement or anything. Mad love bro:
Y'all catchin these drunk tweets again.
@Heyitsray427 I been there, my dear. I mean if you wanna keep it up then go for it. But if not then save ya self the trouble.
@Heyitsray427 It ain't worth the trouble :/
When you realize your only scene in Furious 7 was cut and paste from Tokyo Drift.  
This was awesome. Keep it up bro! 
This is chill, watch Netflix and rub some pretty feet weather.
Lord have mercy. 
I used to send and get them. I hate em now though.  
That way, its all on the table and there's no surpriseses.
If you in the whole "I really wanna settle down soon and have kids" phase, TELL YOUR PARTNER.
This is why it's also important for y'all to make y'all intentions known. If you in the "We'll see where it goes" path, TELL YOUR PARTNER.
Y'all can certainly discuss marriage and y'all's views on it but the actual process and such should happen naturally.
Also, it's unfair to put that pressure of marriage or "next step" onto someone you've been with.
You gotta be ready to give and share your all with somebody when marriage comes I to play. You can't just do that with anyone you date.
Y'all need to know/feel that you two can support each other and y'all potential fam  emotionally, financially, etc. For the rest of time.
There is so much that goes into marriage besides the title.
@LilTwann peep the next few tweets bro.
If our relationship grows into the marriage state then that's cool. Marriage should not be something that's expected of you automatically.
This whole "if you not gonna marry someone you with, don't be with em" nonsense is one of those straight paths to divorce.
You kiddin me right? 
Why did this girl who I havent spoken 2 in light years/don't really like that much, hit me up asking for weed last night?
On point. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><THUMBS UP SIGN> 
WOW BRO! 
You already know, bro. Lol 
I was also pretty much guaranteed a date with this really cool/attractive friend I haven't seen in awhile. She said all I gotta do is visit<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
And I'm ready for round 2 of drinking tonight. Let's go!
Last night was full of love, man.
I went from my desk to the floor and eventually to my bed. Damn....3 grateful dead's and a tequila sun rise. How am I alive???

Next is @_elizzzabeth_ : Even though she treat me like the side nigga, i still love her though. She know i;ll be the best she ever had.
Next off is @pizzagawddess: I love this woman. Id give my left tit for her. Best sister ever.
Next off is @AmityviIIe she gorgeous too. She need to give a dude like me a chance. #drunktweet
First off is @LawdBison: Id wife the shit out her
Who up first?
Yall gon catch these drunk tweets.


Yeah!!! 
2 dollar drinks at the bar tonight? Yeah I'm out. Peace.
Nah. That's where things start gettin weird. She should be able to be stable on her own too.  
I was not expecting tonight to turn out the way it did. But I'm glad it did. Why are people so nice to me?
Amazing. 
Lmao this still isn't old. 
Someone got my name attached to a chicken foot, dug underground somewhere. That really happened.
lmfao you're terrible, 
@amellywood Happy Bday man! Much love much peace and thank you for being such a damn great Arrow.
@moiradoesntcare ight lets do it :3
@moiradoesntcare If you cookin then hell yeah.
Never get what's so funny about comparing ppl to inanimate objects on twitter.
@moiradoesntcare Ight, im takin that up 2 CT then.
@moiradoesntcare You comin 2 Boston? Word!
Well then.................... 
It sucks when you realize that you ain't gonna see one of your best friends for a very long time.
You gettin wifed. 
DBZ never touchin Netflix. That's one of Funimation's babies.  
Shots fired. 
You wanna know what dude a woman is still attached on? See what dude's name comes out her mouth and her actions when she's drunk.
The fact that she went out the way to say that means that she still has issues with Kanye that she ain't deal with.
Amber Rose does what so many females do when they get drunk, they do and say reckless shit and wanna apologize after. Gtfo.
@simplyshyla_ np!
Beautiful. 
@sweetlolixo @yukimeru I see GazettE talk on my timeline. Hi ladies. :3
You doin things right if they block you. 
It's just the beginning. 
Lmaoooo 
And the fact that Whedon or whoever seems to be against a Solo movie for her. Ppl would go see that.
The 2 things I'll admit are messed up is the fact that Black widow isn't being promoted the way the others are with Merch.
@LawdBison I really enjoyed this second one a lot more cuz of what it help set up. The first one is still amazing too though
Is Age of ULTRON the popular thing to hate or do y'all really think it was that bad of a movie....cuz of the black widow portrayal?
Holy crap!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS

So someone got mad over someone else for having an opinion on nudes/slut shamming?
Knowledge. 
@TheOnlyAsaye @_elizzzabeth_ see bro. She think I'm jokin. Women <UNAMUSED FACE>. I gave up though.
@Mrxdgrafiti agreed. They saved the city a lot of destruction by doing that and it showed tremendous courage on him and the others part.
Imagine if Divatox was able to dig up and use the old Zeo Zords. But she ain't that smart...
The turbo rangers do get my respect though. They dead ass held off that onslaught of piranhatrons with no help.
Zordon would've never left the rangers to fend for themselves the way Demetria did. He made sure he suffered with them.
She must've died in the battle of Eltar.
Demetria was a terrible mentor. Rangers were sitting ducks and she decides to leave. What makes it worse is that we never again hear of her.
I wonder if those Zords ever got repaired.
The turbo Zords got trashed, hahaha.
@_elizzzabeth_ @Annoyed_Bassist you not deny in it though.
@Annoyed_Bassist @_elizzzabeth_ I give up,
@Annoyed_Bassist @_elizzzabeth_ OH for real?!
I wouldn't cheat on her, she'd get endless foot rubs and id do what I could to make her feel special. Smh I can't win.
@YogiVI42 I don't see why not.
Id be the best boyfriend for Liz. I'm just waitin for her to take me seriously.
The worst people on here are the ones who Stan/cape for these women on anitwitter. Sit down. They are not these superior people.
@DrellyFish I have no idea how I feel bout this bro.
@Annoyed_Bassist nah bro. I don't approve.
@_elizzzabeth_ sigh....
@_elizzzabeth_ exposed.
@_elizzzabeth_ you can answer my tweets but not my texts? This is why we can't be in a relationship.
LMFAOO Gabby don't start.  
Drop her, bro. 
Where the liquor at, nigga? 
Why is their beef on my TL? Y'all need to go watch some anime and chill the hell out.
I keep forgetting that I'm graduating too. Haha.
I really could care less about the fact that I finished the semester, I'm making actual progress with my dreams. I'm livid right now.
Stoked!
My day out with this pretty lady got pushed back to today and I'm spending all of tonight getting the groups social media accounts done.
Having our song played on the radio was awesome. This really happened. Idc if we didn't draw in many ppl but ppl listened. That's something!
Stay tuned!
The single off of our upcoming EP, which was played tonight is called "CORE." It will be made available with the launch of our FB page!
Also, if you didn't listen to the show, the name of my group's name was revealed as "Zero One Complex!"
Thank you all who tuned into the final radio show of the year. It's been a blast &lt;3
@BackTAYreality 3 episodes is enough to lemme know if it's really worth all the hype.
You know what? I'm gonna give Agents of Shield the 3 episode treatment.
Beautiful. 
Can we not? Sweet mother of Zordon, these shows don't matter lol. 

You can't be self liberating by leaking nudes to black twitter. Stop lyin to ya self, ladies lol
The women who say its self liberating to leak their own nudes on Black twitter, say that to justify the new attention in their mentions/DM's
Lol there's a big difference between self liberation and straight out leaking nudes for attention. Especially on twitter.
These debates never go anywhere. On one side its "you're looking for attention if you leak nudes" the other is "BOO HOO SELF LIBERATION!!"
JDF is at home fuming right now to what CM Punk said. Lmfaoooo its true though....
This is why this section of twitter has such a bad rep. Welcome to anitwitter.

Haha wow dude, I was asking a question. But nvm. Typical anitwitter nigga nonsense. Lmao 
@BlerdsOnline LMFAOO I guess so.
Y'all let y'all feelings about an anime drive y'all to say the most illogical shit ever.
Bro, how does one long running anime have the power to ruin all anime for one person? C'mon now, stop reaching. 
This will be the only time you'll be able to hear the song until we get our mastered version/share groups Facebook page.
I will be posting a link to the stream of the show an hour or so before the show.-
If you've been wondering about the music I've been talking about nonstop, this is your chance to check it out. Do not miss it.
The song is called "Core" and will be played on the air during my final radio show tonight at 10pm to 12am
Got the go ahead to air the single from the EP me and a close friend have been working on in the last few months.
But before then, I have a pretty special announcement.
I have a lot to do before I go out with this pretty lady later on today. Let's get workin.

I really don't need anything else at this point. Dream chasing is priority one. Anything else is secondary...
Last night was the pinnacle and I feel no real drive to satisfy that urge anymore before I leave.
I really feel like I don't need to party anymore this year.
I have the time now to devote to music more. I am happy. Tonight is gonna be productive.
Shit, I couldn't even watch arrow. I dozed off so many damn times lol
Michaela is leaving :(
Looks just as beautiful as mine. 
@DrellyFish bro, do you ever finish half of the stuff you buy? Lol
@moiradoesntcare good question.
@_elizzzabeth_ thanks <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
Hmm.
@lukejamesbgn it is. Funny how they wait until now to drop this....
Amazing what fake texts can do. 
Chillin, watchin Maria the virgin witch.
I love the Cowboy bebop dub but holy crap...the subbed version of the last episode is twice as more intense.
Hustle. 
I'm leaving my own way. My own terms.
Pretty pleased with how I'm making my exit, here.
I must say, I'm pretty proud of myself for getting all this crap done....holy crap.
Spending all day watching Anime. Cuz im bout 2 be done with my last final of the year Wooooooooooooo
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil It must be fun having a stick up your ass because ppl dont like what you like lmao. Anitwitter folk be trippin
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil I've never been happier with my mentions blowing up right now.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil I respect that though. I feel very similarly bout Rurouni Kenshin. It was a prominent part of my growth.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil Nah, its still gonna be a hard pass for me. My hype levels got messed with so bad with this show. I'm bitter.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil Naraku and nah, i haven't.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil a long running anime. I used 2 religiously watch it until it was apparent that they were never gonna beat
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil They could've handled that pacing and such so much better, regardless of the fact that its an adaptation of
@_IsntThatNeil I'd have 2 say so man. Any anime that can get me enraged to the point that Inuyasha has, deserves that label.
@FefylovesYou :&lt;
It took complex magazine this long to realize that DBZ isn't the greatest anime of all time.
@_IsntThatNeil Yeah bro. Inuyasha's pacing can be best described as "Trolling at its best." I got fed up with it.
Inuyasha: trash anime with great OP/END's.

@megantoonice I do. That and also, that corny stuff makes me sick.

I for one support the idea of a solo Black Widow movie but I don't agree with hassling JW to the point of him leaving twitter over it.
Tig is such a good guy. #SonsOfAnarchy

@richiebranson props on the track man. Once again you showed why you're one of my favs of all time.
The main key.  
But till then the love I have for myself suffices <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm not scared of Love nor am I against it. I just wanna be loved sanely and with chill. I know it exists. So ima be optimistic.
Dangerous.
Heh...we all deserve to be loved. But there's some kinds of love that are toxic.
I never wanna be loved or have any other woman attached to me to the extent I was loved and attached to recently....ever again. Ever.
@_elizzzabeth_ <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
And I shouldn't have to worry bout her getting into any unpleasant situations...again, cuz of my past.
I couldn't have picked a better time though. It's pretty much the end of the semester.
@_elizzzabeth_ you know you still got my attention <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Im in a point where I like just hangin with women. It's enjoyable and there's no strings attached. Which is perfect.
Just lookin for a nice chill time and to get to know her more as a person. Obv there prob won't be anything serious though.
It should be nice chillin and spending some time with this girl this week.
I hate how true this is... 
I still can't believe that Civil War is actually happening.

Let this be a lesson to @TMZ. What applies to America in regards to tabloids does not apply to everywhere else.
EXID's Label heads are going to get a statement/ apology from @TMZ one way or another.
At this point its not even about specifically, EXID and the K-Pop community. Its just common sense, which @TMZ clearly doesn't have.
These girls are Korean Natives who speak and sing in Korean. Of course they'd have accents. Was that really necessary? Seriously @TMZ
&lt;3 
I normally don't condone the rabidness that is the K-Pop fandom at time but this is one time I don't mind. Rip @TMZ a new one.
@TMZ What's even worse is that there was an asian woman participating in the dumbassery of that coverage.
@TMZ Is such scum for that LAX Coverage with EXID. I am baffled at how ignorant they are.
Lmaoo crying.

There is so such thing as trusting anyone 100 percent.
For another hour.
Hmm. But lemme go 2 bed.
It's funny how I always manage to find a small great group of women to hang with.
Yesterday was well needed. I'm very thankful for the girls. I was pretty low and they showed a brother mad love.
With 2 songs already completed and 1 near completion, being in a better environment helps better progress things
Yesterday interfered heavily with my music which I am ashamed of....I can't wait to leave and be back in Boston.

Wow. BIGBANG's new songs are nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lemme keep an open mind when listening to these new BIGBANG songs. A lot of their material was nothing but ass before their lil hiatus.
Should be interesting.

But I get sucked into Sons of Anarchy... 
Lemme go watch some anime. It's been days.
@ZeohBleu3 remastered,
What's worse is that the way the singles are remastered/they're vastly different than the rest of the tracks on said album. Makes no sense
LOTUS, HAGESHISA, Sustain The Untruth and RINKAKU's album versions are no where near as powerful as the single versions...
I still don't get why Tue Madsen sucks the soul out of DIR EN GREY's singles when ever its time to put it on the albums.

I feel proud that I'm creating something/doing something meaningful to me. That gives me a reason to wake up every morning.

LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BRO 
@MissElise84 I am currently streaming 
@moiradoesntcare I like you though but...nvm.
@moiradoesntcare I give up. There's no trust in this friendship.
Its cool to think that in a few years, I'll be with someone while being an established rock star.
@moiradoesntcare That you think i'm lyin.
@moiradoesntcare smh...i already know what that means.
Especially since I've made peace with all these events that inspired tracks like this.
I keep tweeting bout how I enjoy making this song but I don't like dwelling in that part of my mind too much.
This is probably one of the few "dark"  songs I'll create.
@moiradoesntcare I got hacked. That last tweet wasn't me.
@moiradoesntcare lmaoo Cold. Lemme take my exit ;__;
@moiradoesntcare 
Told you she likes me.
@moiradoesntcare RT'ing somethin i posted hours ago, creep.
I can't for vocals to be added to this when Its done.
That chorus i just wrote.
Oh man...I'm loving this song more and more.
Amazing. 
It's amazing to see how all these white racists come out the cut when something tragic happens in the black community.
What did that dude expect would happen? My goodness.  
Moira likes me.
@moiradoesntcare eyyyyy <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

@moiradoesntcare Welp.
@moiradoesntcare I like you though.
What the fuck...? Was replacing Paul's face supposed to be funny? 
@Jazputin I don't agree at all with what they're doing (looting and such). But damn, that's years of repressed anger....
TDWP's 8:18 has some of the nastiest metalcore breakdowns...
These ppl are going through many lengths to bring us some quality super hero movies.
Good luck to Evans, RDJ, SJ and the rest of the Avengers Cast...the infinity war will be filmed for 9 months
What's going on in Baltimore could easily happen back home, that's a scary thought at times.
I'm bout to buy that new TDWP song. This YT rip is so shitty
BTS's I Need U is nice.....
Straight facts. 
There is a God.

Shout out to @7uic3 he a real nigga. No judgement or anything. Mad love bro:
Y'all catchin these drunk tweets again.
@Heyitsray427 I been there, my dear. I mean if you wanna keep it up then go for it. But if not then save ya self the trouble.
@Heyitsray427 It ain't worth the trouble :/
When you realize your only scene in Furious 7 was cut and paste from Tokyo Drift.  
This was awesome. Keep it up bro! 
This is chill, watch Netflix and rub some pretty feet weather.
Lord have mercy. 
I used to send and get them. I hate em now though.  
That way, its all on the table and there's no surpriseses.
If you in the whole "I really wanna settle down soon and have kids" phase, TELL YOUR PARTNER.
This is why it's also important for y'all to make y'all intentions known. If you in the "We'll see where it goes" path, TELL YOUR PARTNER.
Y'all can certainly discuss marriage and y'all's views on it but the actual process and such should happen naturally.
Also, it's unfair to put that pressure of marriage or "next step" onto someone you've been with.
You gotta be ready to give and share your all with somebody when marriage comes I to play. You can't just do that with anyone you date.
Y'all need to know/feel that you two can support each other and y'all potential fam  emotionally, financially, etc. For the rest of time.
There is so much that goes into marriage besides the title.
@LilTwann peep the next few tweets bro.
If our relationship grows into the marriage state then that's cool. Marriage should not be something that's expected of you automatically.
This whole "if you not gonna marry someone you with, don't be with em" nonsense is one of those straight paths to divorce.
You kiddin me right? 
Why did this girl who I havent spoken 2 in light years/don't really like that much, hit me up asking for weed last night?
On point. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><THUMBS UP SIGN> 
WOW BRO! 
You already know, bro. Lol 
I was also pretty much guaranteed a date with this really cool/attractive friend I haven't seen in awhile. She said all I gotta do is visit<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
And I'm ready for round 2 of drinking tonight. Let's go!
Last night was full of love, man.
I went from my desk to the floor and eventually to my bed. Damn....3 grateful dead's and a tequila sun rise. How am I alive???

Next is @_elizzzabeth_ : Even though she treat me like the side nigga, i still love her though. She know i;ll be the best she ever had.
Next off is @pizzagawddess: I love this woman. Id give my left tit for her. Best sister ever.
Next off is @AmityviIIe she gorgeous too. She need to give a dude like me a chance. #drunktweet
First off is @LawdBison: Id wife the shit out her
Who up first?
Yall gon catch these drunk tweets.


Yeah!!! 
2 dollar drinks at the bar tonight? Yeah I'm out. Peace.
Nah. That's where things start gettin weird. She should be able to be stable on her own too.  
I was not expecting tonight to turn out the way it did. But I'm glad it did. Why are people so nice to me?
Amazing. 
Lmao this still isn't old. 
Someone got my name attached to a chicken foot, dug underground somewhere. That really happened.
lmfao you're terrible, 
@amellywood Happy Bday man! Much love much peace and thank you for being such a damn great Arrow.
@moiradoesntcare ight lets do it :3
@moiradoesntcare If you cookin then hell yeah.
Never get what's so funny about comparing ppl to inanimate objects on twitter.
@moiradoesntcare Ight, im takin that up 2 CT then.
@moiradoesntcare You comin 2 Boston? Word!
Well then.................... 
It sucks when you realize that you ain't gonna see one of your best friends for a very long time.
You gettin wifed. 
DBZ never touchin Netflix. That's one of Funimation's babies.  
Shots fired. 
You wanna know what dude a woman is still attached on? See what dude's name comes out her mouth and her actions when she's drunk.
The fact that she went out the way to say that means that she still has issues with Kanye that she ain't deal with.
Amber Rose does what so many females do when they get drunk, they do and say reckless shit and wanna apologize after. Gtfo.
@simplyshyla_ np!
Beautiful. 
@sweetlolixo @yukimeru I see GazettE talk on my timeline. Hi ladies. :3
You doin things right if they block you. 
It's just the beginning. 
Lmaoooo 
And the fact that Whedon or whoever seems to be against a Solo movie for her. Ppl would go see that.
The 2 things I'll admit are messed up is the fact that Black widow isn't being promoted the way the others are with Merch.
@LawdBison I really enjoyed this second one a lot more cuz of what it help set up. The first one is still amazing too though
Is Age of ULTRON the popular thing to hate or do y'all really think it was that bad of a movie....cuz of the black widow portrayal?
Holy crap!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS

So someone got mad over someone else for having an opinion on nudes/slut shamming?
Knowledge. 
@TheOnlyAsaye @_elizzzabeth_ see bro. She think I'm jokin. Women <UNAMUSED FACE>. I gave up though.
@Mrxdgrafiti agreed. They saved the city a lot of destruction by doing that and it showed tremendous courage on him and the others part.
Imagine if Divatox was able to dig up and use the old Zeo Zords. But she ain't that smart...
The turbo rangers do get my respect though. They dead ass held off that onslaught of piranhatrons with no help.
Zordon would've never left the rangers to fend for themselves the way Demetria did. He made sure he suffered with them.
She must've died in the battle of Eltar.
Demetria was a terrible mentor. Rangers were sitting ducks and she decides to leave. What makes it worse is that we never again hear of her.
I wonder if those Zords ever got repaired.
The turbo Zords got trashed, hahaha.
@_elizzzabeth_ @Annoyed_Bassist you not deny in it though.
@Annoyed_Bassist @_elizzzabeth_ I give up,
@Annoyed_Bassist @_elizzzabeth_ OH for real?!
I wouldn't cheat on her, she'd get endless foot rubs and id do what I could to make her feel special. Smh I can't win.
@YogiVI42 I don't see why not.
Id be the best boyfriend for Liz. I'm just waitin for her to take me seriously.
The worst people on here are the ones who Stan/cape for these women on anitwitter. Sit down. They are not these superior people.
@DrellyFish I have no idea how I feel bout this bro.
@Annoyed_Bassist nah bro. I don't approve.
@_elizzzabeth_ sigh....
@_elizzzabeth_ exposed.
@_elizzzabeth_ you can answer my tweets but not my texts? This is why we can't be in a relationship.
LMFAOO Gabby don't start.  
Drop her, bro. 
Where the liquor at, nigga? 
Why is their beef on my TL? Y'all need to go watch some anime and chill the hell out.
I keep forgetting that I'm graduating too. Haha.
I really could care less about the fact that I finished the semester, I'm making actual progress with my dreams. I'm livid right now.
Stoked!
My day out with this pretty lady got pushed back to today and I'm spending all of tonight getting the groups social media accounts done.
Having our song played on the radio was awesome. This really happened. Idc if we didn't draw in many ppl but ppl listened. That's something!
Stay tuned!
The single off of our upcoming EP, which was played tonight is called "CORE." It will be made available with the launch of our FB page!
Also, if you didn't listen to the show, the name of my group's name was revealed as "Zero One Complex!"
Thank you all who tuned into the final radio show of the year. It's been a blast &lt;3
@BackTAYreality 3 episodes is enough to lemme know if it's really worth all the hype.
You know what? I'm gonna give Agents of Shield the 3 episode treatment.
Beautiful. 
Can we not? Sweet mother of Zordon, these shows don't matter lol. 

You can't be self liberating by leaking nudes to black twitter. Stop lyin to ya self, ladies lol
The women who say its self liberating to leak their own nudes on Black twitter, say that to justify the new attention in their mentions/DM's
Lol there's a big difference between self liberation and straight out leaking nudes for attention. Especially on twitter.
These debates never go anywhere. On one side its "you're looking for attention if you leak nudes" the other is "BOO HOO SELF LIBERATION!!"
JDF is at home fuming right now to what CM Punk said. Lmfaoooo its true though....
This is why this section of twitter has such a bad rep. Welcome to anitwitter.

Haha wow dude, I was asking a question. But nvm. Typical anitwitter nigga nonsense. Lmao 
@BlerdsOnline LMFAOO I guess so.
Y'all let y'all feelings about an anime drive y'all to say the most illogical shit ever.
Bro, how does one long running anime have the power to ruin all anime for one person? C'mon now, stop reaching. 
This will be the only time you'll be able to hear the song until we get our mastered version/share groups Facebook page.
I will be posting a link to the stream of the show an hour or so before the show.-
If you've been wondering about the music I've been talking about nonstop, this is your chance to check it out. Do not miss it.
The song is called "Core" and will be played on the air during my final radio show tonight at 10pm to 12am
Got the go ahead to air the single from the EP me and a close friend have been working on in the last few months.
But before then, I have a pretty special announcement.
I have a lot to do before I go out with this pretty lady later on today. Let's get workin.

Last night was the pinnacle and I feel no real drive to satisfy that urge anymore before I leave.
I really feel like I don't need to party anymore this year.
I have the time now to devote to music more. I am happy. Tonight is gonna be productive.
Shit, I couldn't even watch arrow. I dozed off so many damn times lol
Michaela is leaving :(
Looks just as beautiful as mine. 
@DrellyFish bro, do you ever finish half of the stuff you buy? Lol
@moiradoesntcare good question.

@lukejamesbgn it is. Funny how they wait until now to drop this....
Amazing what fake texts can do. 
Chillin, watchin Maria the virgin witch.
I love the Cowboy bebop dub but holy crap...the subbed version of the last episode is twice as more intense.
Hustle. 
I'm leaving my own way. My own terms.
Pretty pleased with how I'm making my exit, here.
I must say, I'm pretty proud of myself for getting all this crap done....holy crap.
Spending all day watching Anime. Cuz im bout 2 be done with my last final of the year Wooooooooooooo
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil It must be fun having a stick up your ass because ppl dont like what you like lmao. Anitwitter folk be trippin
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil I've never been happier with my mentions blowing up right now.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil I respect that though. I feel very similarly bout Rurouni Kenshin. It was a prominent part of my growth.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil Nah, its still gonna be a hard pass for me. My hype levels got messed with so bad with this show. I'm bitter.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil Naraku and nah, i haven't.
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil a long running anime. I used 2 religiously watch it until it was apparent that they were never gonna beat
@FefylovesYou @_IsntThatNeil They could've handled that pacing and such so much better, regardless of the fact that its an adaptation of
@_IsntThatNeil I'd have 2 say so man. Any anime that can get me enraged to the point that Inuyasha has, deserves that label.
@FefylovesYou :&lt;
It took complex magazine this long to realize that DBZ isn't the greatest anime of all time.
@_IsntThatNeil Yeah bro. Inuyasha's pacing can be best described as "Trolling at its best." I got fed up with it.
Inuyasha: trash anime with great OP/END's.

@richiebranson props on the track man. Once again you showed why you're one of my favs of all time.
The main key.  
But till then the love I have for myself suffices <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm not scared of Love nor am I against it. I just wanna be loved sanely and with chill. I know it exists. So ima be optimistic.
Dangerous.
Heh...we all deserve to be loved. But there's some kinds of love that are toxic.
I never wanna be loved or have any other woman attached to me to the extent I was loved and attached to recently....ever again. Ever.
@_elizzzabeth_ <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
And I shouldn't have to worry bout her getting into any unpleasant situations...again, cuz of my past.
I couldn't have picked a better time though. It's pretty much the end of the semester.
@_elizzzabeth_ you know you still got my attention <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Im in a point where I like just hangin with women. It's enjoyable and there's no strings attached. Which is perfect.
Just lookin for a nice chill time and to get to know her more as a person. Obv there prob won't be anything serious though.
It should be nice chillin and spending some time with this girl this week.
I hate how true this is...

Let this be a lesson to @TMZ. What applies to America in regards to tabloids does not apply to everywhere else.
EXID's Label heads are going to get a statement/ apology from @TMZ one way or another.
At this point its not even about specifically, EXID and the K-Pop community. Its just common sense, which @TMZ clearly doesn't have.
These girls are Korean Natives who speak and sing in Korean. Of course they'd have accents. Was that really necessary? Seriously @TMZ
&lt;3 
I normally don't condone the rabidness that is the K-Pop fandom at time but this is one time I don't mind. Rip @TMZ a new one.
@TMZ What's even worse is that there was an asian woman participating in the dumbassery of that coverage.
@TMZ Is such scum for that LAX Coverage with EXID. I am baffled at how ignorant they are.
Lmaoo crying.

It's funny how I always manage to find a small great group of women to hang with.
Yesterday was well needed. I'm very thankful for the girls. I was pretty low and they showed a brother mad love.
With 2 songs already completed and 1 near completion, being in a better environment helps better progress things
Yesterday interfered heavily with my music which I am ashamed of....I can't wait to leave and be back in Boston.

Anitwitter famous are just as annoying as regular twitter famous ppl.
Chillin, watchin Aquarion. 
Uh oh!!!!!! 
Y u do this?? 
@DrellyFish @BlueBeastGUY damn. I'm down  to try it out.
@BlueBeastGUY @DrellyFish this on PSN?
Every fucking time. Some white ppl are amazing. 
@Nerdy_Sage @jeremSenpai y'all ain't make shieeeetttttt
I AM SO HYPE. CMON GIVE US SOME PREVIEWS!!!!!!!! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 
"Killing your mommy was an accident." When Gemma said those words and Abel heard her, I knew she was dead. #SonsOfAnarchy
@Dr_Snekindekin just random that's all bro haha
@Dr_Snekindekin lol wtf?
New Balance is on the verge of pressing charges on @kylegotjokes Serves him right, dumbass.
This ain't even funny.  
This ain't adding up. How is a dude with a spine injury and seen dragged in a can by cops able to injure himself? 
Facts. 
But I get sucked into Sons of Anarchy... 
Lemme go watch some anime. It's been days.
@ZeohBleu3 remastered,
What's worse is that the way the singles are remastered/they're vastly different than the rest of the tracks on said album. Makes no sense
LOTUS, HAGESHISA, Sustain The Untruth and RINKAKU's album versions are no where near as powerful as the single versions...
I still don't get why Tue Madsen sucks the soul out of DIR EN GREY's singles when ever its time to put it on the albums.
Fight!!!!!!!!  #Arrow
Laurel you can sit your ass down too #Arrow
HOLY SHIT. OLIVER AINT PLAYIN #Arrow

@BISHPLEASE I thought i was the only one...
No, stop being an idiot.  
#NP EXID-A SUL HAE
That idiot Kyle got what he wanted. 
Sukekiyo's Zephyr just reeks of cool...
Peeps quick to believe anything, in the midst of all this...without doing any prior fact checking. 
Hbd Brodie 
The screwed up thing here is he knows ppl who don't know any better will believe those photos. Niggas ain't shit.
@kylegotjokes dude you are such a piece of shit. Baltimore is in shambles RN and you use that to bait a company into looking bad. Fuck you.
All of this just to get a reaction from the actual new balance account. Why do black twitter fools love getting hard ons to this?
Ladies and gentlemen. This is why black twitter ain't shit. Amazing. As if new balance would advertise like this. 
Cuz FB is pretty terrible.  
Eyyyyy. 
That's all you bro.  
Hype for Avengers but I gotta wait till next week to watch. Being a good friend and waiting till one of my ppls comes back.
Man, lemme move on to real life ASAP. Cuz this semester has been one heart attack after the next <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Too many close calls this week. Lawd have mercy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gonna make today my bitch.
Gives me a sense of purpose.
I feel proud that I'm creating something/doing something meaningful to me. That gives me a reason to wake up every morning.

@MissElise84 I am currently streaming 
@moiradoesntcare I like you though but...nvm.
@moiradoesntcare I give up. There's no trust in this friendship.
Its cool to think that in a few years, I'll be with someone while being an established rock star.
@moiradoesntcare That you think i'm lyin.
@moiradoesntcare smh...i already know what that means.
Especially since I've made peace with all these events that inspired tracks like this.
I keep tweeting bout how I enjoy making this song but I don't like dwelling in that part of my mind too much.
This is probably one of the few "dark"  songs I'll create.
@moiradoesntcare I got hacked. That last tweet wasn't me.
@moiradoesntcare lmaoo Cold. Lemme take my exit ;__;
@moiradoesntcare 
Told you she likes me.
@moiradoesntcare RT'ing somethin i posted hours ago, creep.
I can't for vocals to be added to this when Its done.
That chorus i just wrote.
Oh man...I'm loving this song more and more.
Amazing. 
It's amazing to see how all these white racists come out the cut when something tragic happens in the black community.
What did that dude expect would happen? My goodness.  
Moira likes me.
@moiradoesntcare eyyyyy <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

@moiradoesntcare Welp.
@moiradoesntcare I like you though.
What the fuck...? Was replacing Paul's face supposed to be funny? 
@Jazputin I don't agree at all with what they're doing (looting and such). But damn, that's years of repressed anger....
TDWP's 8:18 has some of the nastiest metalcore breakdowns...
These ppl are going through many lengths to bring us some quality super hero movies.
Good luck to Evans, RDJ, SJ and the rest of the Avengers Cast...the infinity war will be filmed for 9 months
What's going on in Baltimore could easily happen back home, that's a scary thought at times.
I'm bout to buy that new TDWP song. This YT rip is so shitty
BTS's I Need U is nice.....
Sweet. 
@CloudMG07 @DrellyFish lmfaoooo damn.

Looks like I'll be taking another 2 week break from writing. With all I have due, I can't be creative.
And I'm not taking bout creators and such, I mean the Stan's/weeabos.
And do that, I really find it hard to delve that much in certain fandoms. There's ppl who's lively hoods are these interests.
I like to believe My view points and habits when it comes to expressing my love for things is tame.
I get that there's ppl who into that due to God knows why but to me it's like who can be the biggest dweeb.
Being an excessive fan and doing embarrassing shit in the name of an interest is something I'm 100 percent against.
Weeaboos make me sick. #Blocked. 
My pops is disappointed in me. But there's nothing I can do bout the situation now.
@snapbaeks yeah! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

Is Toriyama broke?
Kenshin is still the only anime that has caused me to cry and actually feel the struggle that the characters go through. It's beautiful.
@Nwanu the shishio arc is still my favorite. Still not find with the Jinchuu arc but from what I've seen so far......it's heavy.

I hate not writing music so screw it and besides....the more demo's the better.
Starting yet another random song cuz I can't make progress atm with the final song of the EP.
That was an interesting match though.

I don't even need to watch extreme rules to know that Orton isn't gonna win the WHC title back. Seth isn't gonna be a transitional champ.
@FireCrotchCoral @SonGokuTho that doesn't make it any better though. Smh...that sucks.
@FireCrotchCoral @SonGokuTho that's super disrespectful......
Daredevil is gonna be put on hold until I finish my Sons of Anarchy season 7 rewatch.

I wouldn't say that this is a waste of a night but i should've stayed in and watched GOTG like I originally planned.
But I'll just keep it at that.
The moment it stops feeling natural, it's time to call it quits and just go bout life as usual.
It's a lot easier to do what's natural, if you ask me.

This ain't for me. Time to eat this food and go 2 bed.

SONS OF ANARCHY SEASON 7 IS ON NETFLIX.
@snapbaeks yup! And EXODUS is awesome! One of my favorite releases this year.
@snapbaeks hey! I've been good! Just busy with a lot. Working on a project with Jami <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> wbu?
Amazing. 
@UnknownNeo very odd...
The duel between Kaiba and Ishizu just got awkward....the animation style rendered the characters emotionless.
Why the hell does the animation style of Yugioh season 2 fluctuate between amazing and terrible?!
Terrance is still deactivated? Pussy.
I love myself so much
Yup. 
Lmfaooooo 
Lmaoo ouch. 
Hi @snapbaeks
@missmaianh looks nice on you<THUMBS UP SIGN>
@moiradoesntcare sorry, been a busy week. All is well, pretty lady?
Haven't head from @moiradoesntcare in days....
What?!!!!!!! 
All clear and sunny here <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> 
I remember reading that Ledger was warmed, prior about the Joker role by Nicholson....I wonder if Leto received a similar one.
Anime fan•

There's probably some truth to this. DBZ ended on a fine note to be honest. 
THE DEVIL WHISPERS IN MY EARRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
All that talk to have her account deactivated. 
@desuicky she has no right to be mad now.
@Nwanu I see whatchu sayin.
@pizzagawddess @Beetlejujuice inappropriate
"I already know Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is gonna be trash." Person hasn't seen a single preview. Explain, how this makes sense?
And also, my LRT is right. Stop judging based on a picture and not seeing any on screen action.
@mobilesuitwaifu good looks.
I get that Nolan's batman series has high regards but that time is done.
J leto's Joker is cool. Y'all gotta let this fascination with the past go.
@mobilesuitwaifu song playing in the background?
They cool in general though, which is why I won't block em.
@PikaChulita Lmao you safe.
My TL could do without that nonsense.
Last chick I muted is a virgin who faking as a freak.
Muted one chick who wouldn't stop fetchin for attention by calling her self ugly. Muted another for not shutting up bout her bf.
My TL is hella tame and bearable.
Lmfao 
Real... 
Asking myself the same question. 
11:38 am and I'm still in the mood to get booty bumped.
You know what's up. 
@jeremSenpai that's how it be.
Rise and shine, lil bro

The magic is happening. 
But they play MK, SF, Xenoverse, Storm and a bunch of other lames.
I should challenge everyone I hate on here in Tekken, just to beat their ass and rub it in their faces.
Blocked. 
Um anywhere. It's not limited to just those two.  
PR's for American artists are either too lax or non existent nowadays. That's why day after day we see these dumb wars between celebs.
When The boys from the GazettE kept fuckih around on twitter, their PR came through and shut that shit down quick. They not bout that.
As much as I believe labels can be toxic to artists in Asia, they do one thing right. That's keeping their artists on check on social media.
Hell, for all we know, Japan or Korea could have their own version of The whole tyga, black chyna and Kylie Jenner but we won't know bout it
Still highly convinced that asian pop culture is one that's more calm and collective than Americas.
This is hillarious.
When 17 year old box isn't as great as you thought it would be:

I have decided to take on the role of President as MCLA since there is currently none. Thank you all for the support!
That's all ima say on this issue. Back 2 work.
@reinaKATTx Black twitter nonsense.
Y'all tellin me that both parties couldn't discuss this privately?
I'm not discrediting the fact that this young woman may have been raped or w/e but best believe she's enjoying her mentions blowin up.
Black people love making a fiasco in the wrong places, just so ppl can see.
Lord have mercy. 
Regardless of if this women allegedly got raped or not, both parties are wrong are bringing this to twitter.
Fake scenario's for the win. 
FURIOUS 8: 4/14/2017. I AM READY FOR THIS.
@cult0fpunk Its all good! I haven't sat down and watched it in its entirety, only the last bunch of eps and the teamup. Will do soon though!
@cult0fpunk Lost Galaxy rewatch?! NICEEEE
MY BODY ISNT READY. 
At this point, Marvel is gonna spoil the rest of Age of Ultron before the movie comes out....
Women really act like they can control other women complimenting their mans. As if a compliment is gonna make them cheat. Insecurity at best
the insecurity is real. 
I haven't watched Power Rangers in weeks....this has to change.
DC is on the right foot with these upcoming spinoff TV shows. Marvel on the other hand.........
Gonna resume working D:
@basedlexi hasn't blessed the TL in a minute.
And the TL is now blessed. 
Yes!!!!!  
@PikaChulita pretty silly. Yaoi can be just as awesome as any other. Who cares about sexual orientation? It's all good.
@PikaChulita lmao I got in trouble cuz my moms found the light novel of it in my room while packing up my stuff Lmaoo. And yeah that's
Hahahaha. Damn Ro.
@basedlexi I looked up tweets directed at certain ppl or you can use one of those sites that let you see em, via google.
Even though I was 'happy' at the time, it's still embarrassing.
I really can't believe I tweeted this shit Lmaoo
I decided to randomly look at my tweets from 2-3 years ago. I'm sick. I swear to never be that much of a simp while in a relationship again.
I hate twitter and most importantly, ppl sometimes.  
@PikaChulita that really didn't Bother me to be honest. It has a great story and is very tame.
Hella. 
Damn this brings me back to my early high school days. 
I eventually wanna Reread or watch loveless.
@PikaChulita <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

@IvonneMarrie It was trendy back a few years ago but only so few ppl partake in it.
Chris Rubey's solos on the chorus, sex. And Daniel's drumming....superb as always.
Loving the placing of Jeremy's clean vocals. And Trick shines so much in this track as well.

You need help if you feel such private matters are of such need to share with twitter.
Fap all you want, it's your dick. We don't need to know when, where, how or the struggles of your fapping. Get a journal if it's that srs.
Anitwitter is the only place where niggas dead ass update the TL/openly discuss their masturbation habits. Y'all too comfortable on here...
Mai should've forfeited the match lol.
Samurai's 
I felt so sorry for Mai when she had to face Marik. Like, you know she was gonna lose. It was just a matter of how.
Yes I'm continuing my rewatch.
Second season of Yugioh was extremely well written.
you must be stupid.... 
@YunoIsBae Thats too much.....
@SOTIEARRA I've had the experience. Not pleasant.
She's hella cute and has her shit together, intellectually and just in general.
Hung out with someone who i never really hung with for more than a certain amount of time today. It was very pleasant.
@pizzagawddess @Annoyed_Bassist lmfaoooooo
@pizzagawddess @CorbinMacklin @Annoyed_Bassist @Nita_Babe This reunion in my mentions makes me happy.
Straight facts. 
RDJ was so right to walk out of that interview. He was there to promote the Avengers, not to be asked about his past....
Miss me with that.

I quit hahaha 
Id never expect such great composition from a kids TV show...and even as a kid, i knew this was some great music.
As cheesy as some of the songs are, Yu-Gi-Oh's first two seasons has some of the greatest musical compositions, ever.
You have patience bro. Idk if I could wait that long. 
Iggy azalea is one of the most influential rappers of our time. Stop sleeping on her.

@Koreaboo @snapbaeks Dude this is cool. I am stoked!
LMFAOO yes. 
Lol what did I do to piss another weeb off? 
420 blz it. 
The average person wouldn't be able to tell I was in a relationship unless I told em anyways. I've erased every trace of it on social media.
Well if ppl have to ask then I guess I'm doing a good job at keeping that part of my life, private.
Highlight of the weekend: Being asked across the room, at a party if I'm with my ex. Amazing.
That's so foul. 
@KlaudiaCapalbo nice.
It's nice not belonging to a specific group on twitter. You can roam in peace and do as you please with no real associations.
Who tryna throw down in Smash bro's?
I love finding new K-Pop to bump.
So Kim Yeonji is a member from The Seeya and dropped a solo project called FORGOT....this song is pretty nice.
Listening to TDWP's 8:18.
I wanna see.

I have a major reason to be down in the dumps today but ima do my best to fight it.
Nothing wrong with weed or 420. Just don't be annoying bout it, that's all.
Here's to hoping I could aid in fixing that.
In the midst of everything going on, I really forgot what's important....

Females who bait ppl into feeling sorry for them on here are the worst, yet they're the ones y'all "make famous" on here.

How to desperately get attention on twitter: Calling yourself ugly and bragging about your features.
@_elizzzabeth_ you know where to find me if you wanna talk.
@_elizzzabeth_ :(
If you celebrating 420, have fun and be safe.
Oh I'm SOOO scared.  
You want a cookie?  
Aggravating much of US pop culture is still continually shoving the Kardashians and Jenners with their misappropriations in our faces...
White ppl spent all this time crackin jokes/mocking black ppl for having "big lips" but hop on the #kyliejennerchallenge bandwagon. Amazing.

Straight facts.  
Furious 7 made hella bank. I will say this now, from here on out, any Fast and Furious slander will not be tolerated. This franchise is boss
Maria The Virgin witch is a pretty damn good anime.
@BornS1nna oh goodness....
Dawg do we really need to do this?  
@BornS1nna who is that?
Lmaooo 
@majinnina you seem very mature/have your shit together.
@Dr_Snekindekin lol i don't mind, as long as it's reasonable.
@majinnina Jesus, woman. You come off as someone who's at least 23-24. Lolol
Rewind. What? You're 19? 
Welp.

I don't know what peace is in a relationship anymore. To be quite honest, I don't even think I've experienced it much.

@XOkiaa why you even entertaining these ppl?
I just got on but I'm logging out.  
Even while tipsy, the hollering going on outside is annoying.
Shaw died the same way she did...i think she's alive. Cuz he is as well. 
Oh man, I'm prob gonna pick up my guitar after watching this live. I am inspired.
SUKEKIYO is a unique band solely because of it's lineup. Nothing but talented dudes from well respected bands who love music.....
This live performance of it is so full of raw energy. Got damn........
Zephyr is my all time fav SUKEKIYO track because it oozes of RENTRER EN SOI vibes....oh man.
Kyo is one of the greatest, if not the best vocalist of our time.
@Nerdy_Sage whatever it is, it looks hella silly.
Watching the Live footage from Sukekiyo's VITIUM DVD. It's weird but refreshing to see Kyo rocking it wit another lineup/band.
I can't lie, I'm not that stoked for revival of F. I'll watch but I wish Toriyama would let the shit be. Is a Another God form necessary?
Enough internet for the day. 
Killin it bro 
@daniecal they're signed on for 2 more haha
How many times is this picture gonna do rotations on the TL? 
Got damn it.... 
Ppl who know about the situation I was In, a few months ago will know exactly where this energy is coming from when they hear this....
@Mrxdgrafiti latest one I believe!
Man, this track is coming out to be so evil......got damn.
The Kardashian's and Jenners have way too much power.
This Future Mixtape is not bad at all.
You gettin wifed. 
Ladies take notes 
How to be more trash. 
And the new ones that I made throughout the weekend. So I'm extremely thankful for that.
To be honest, I really didn't have fun with my actual friends this year at the con besides the two I barely get to see.
It was very uncomfortable being with then for the short period at Anime Boston...
I'm not saying that I'm the greatest person but when he's with them, they are never chillin/peaceful. Even worse, drunk.
I learned a few weekends ago that one of my best friends hangs with some of the shitiest people I've ever met.
Nigga what? 
It took you four OP's to realize this? 

Y’all niggas are a joke.
Yoooo lmfaooooo

@Acmw95 whats up?
One part of you enjoys how it blends in with the atmosphere but the other part kinda makes you feel a tad bit lonely.
This is good and bad,
K-Pop sounds so damn good at night.
@Acmw95 yo.
grow up. 
OR I just get the vibe that they're 'trying' but really could care less bout it and i stop trying.
I'm tired of tryna teach women Im with about the things im into. A lot of the time, they just aren't interested. Or stop wanting 2 learn.
Bro, id love to find someone who appreciates my love for J-rock/K-Pop as much as i do.
Oh man, these songs are bringing back so many memories.
You got this. 
Black Beauty. 
Listening to D'espair's Ray's COLL:SET. This such a throwback.
@HeStayChillin Word. Stay reachin.

@fuzzypickles_ I've squashed beefs here too. Lol
@fuzzypickles_ oh of course! I just think this is all one big joke.
There was never any real beef guys. It was all a joke! I get it now! Perfectly planned/done too <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
What about the other loud mouth gamer chick that promoted her self, right after ranting about what's her face? She was in on this jig too?

@jeremSenpai
Well I can't talk. There's a lot of you I didn't like either. Especially Jerem. But now I'ma end up tappin that so it's all good.
A month or two ago:"you ain't shit! Ya BF ain't shit Don't ever come at my home girl! Don't fav my tweets!" Now:"WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!"
But lemme chill. I don't wanna be a firestarter. But damn that is so screwed!!!! XDDDDDDD
So I'm the only one that notices this? Y'all are oblivious AF. Lolol
@Nwanu hilariously uncool.
I dead ass had to do a double take on the names I seen interacting with one another. I thought I was hallucinating.
Fuck it, I'm calling it. Publicity stunt.
Amazing. After all that hoohah that was caused. Y'all really ain't shit. Lmfaoooooo
You know what, if it keeps the peace. Then so be it. Y'all anitwitter/nerd twitter folk are an odd bunch....and shady.
And that's the same girl who.....
Wait hold up a second...I could've sworn a few weeks ago, these two were mortal enemies on here. Now they friends?
So....these white cheerleaders made a rap about "Lynching nigggers." I won't even trip cuz they prob gonna get off with a slap on the wrist.
Blocked. TF outta here with this simp nonsense,  
TROLOLOLOLOL  
Single twitter is fun.
Visual Kei is a scene where the looks and music are supposed to go hand in Hand. EU VK hasn't grasped this.
Make actual music.
The EU Visual Kei scene is highly looked down upon in many parts of the J-rock fandom....and it's well deserved if you ask me.
Will eat it up regardless.
When you check out their music, it's either boring or highly repetitive. There's no need to put effort in because they know their fans
Besides like one band, I'm under the impression, a lot of these guys are popular because they simply look good.
I'm really against 99.9 percent of the Visual Kei scene in Europe.
I found @pizzagawddess Doppelgänger lol

I'm still waiting on that extended Super Megaforce finale to hit Netflix, bro.
@Mrxdgrafiti I don't plan on watching the entire series besides one or two arcs so i don't mind much
This one Piece arc gives me all the back stories so I don't have to go and rewatch the beginning eps.
@MissElise84 @fuzzypickles_ nope.

Productive night. Gonna sleep well. Peace
A page from the hangover.

It was still a great night.
But at the end of the day, I can laugh about this past weekend. I still find what happened to be hella odd and suspect but...
But thank God, after these last 2 times, I was still able to leave those situations, with both relationships in tact.
Got damn it. And I can honestly say its not even my fault because no matter how much i try, it naturally happens. Shit, man.
If its one thing I learned this year is that I always manage to put my new female friends in terrible positions.
It's amazing how well Jeremy can get so many people riled up. That man is a troll and you play into his hands every single time.
That's enough One Piece for tonight.
"Sniper king, shoot down that flag." Luffy is a real nigga.
@UnknownNeo im so lost with this stuff. I just got this damn thing. But thanks
@_elizzzabeth_ <UNAMUSED FACE>
@_elizzzabeth_ you'd like that. And I'm face timing you.
@EmuTheDave thanks man!
Is the mewtwo DLC free and how do I get it for my 3DS?
@EmuTheDave yes
I see why the Enies Lobbies arc is Highly regarded within One piece fans...
@LawdBison LMFAOOO wow! How we gonna make this work?
Back to watchin One Piece. 
@LawdBison you need 2 trust me XD
@LawdBison I'm livin a low key life. Dun worry bout em <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@moiradoesntcare my service is probably why I ain't get it lol. Sorry!
@moiradoesntcare I shot you a text earlier btw lol.

@moiradoesntcare yo that avy is gorgeous
@moiradoesntcare <EYES> oh really?
Lolol damn. 
Can't wait to watch some more One Piece later/this week.
Damn, this is funny. 
One day I'm gonna take @LawdBison on a date.
C'mon man. Respect the art of music. Make it sound as clean as possible. Don't throw something in there that sounds like ass.
I get that there's things that he doesn't take seriously which is fine. That's who he is but when it comes to production, be professional.
I like Tyler. I think he's cool but from what I'm hearing about the album and his decision regarding it, bad call, bro. Bad call.

After age of ULTRON, I'm no longer watching any more than the first trailer for any marvel movies in the future.
With all the Age of ULTRON stuff flying around, we might as well have seen the movie. It's too much now.
@majinnina ppl gonna hop on the hype. If anything all of this makes me wanna see whatever this noise is about.
The future hive seems more fun and chill than the beyhive.

When there's no major sport events or TV shows on, the dumbassery on here hits an all time high...what is wrong with y'all?
Really Nigga? 
Cuz I still have never been sexual but maybe I will in my next relationship.
Next girl I'm with is gonna have 2 wait a year before we get sexual.
One piece is pretty nice
Nap tymeeeee
@LOUD_besos don't argue with me Rina <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
If that's their opinion. I don't see what's wrong with this. 
@_elizzzabeth_ dat avy.
The new MK game looks like it'll be fun for fans but to me, it's still the same stiff, try hard game. Have fun though. It's just not for me
Ppl are so stupid.... 
I can't even feel bad for Drake in this situation. He let himself continue to be the nigga in the chair cuz he thought it was cool.
This is so disgusting....the look on her face must means there's something wrong her, orally.  
Finally resuming my watch of One Piece's Enies Lobbies arc.
With a crazy weekend like this past one, Ira only right to work my ass off this week.
Sleep tyme
This dude Drake looked disgusted after that kiss.....

Damn dude, the UROKO PV is awesome cuz of how cool, yet serious the members look while playing their instruments.
Dir en grey in HD never looked better. 
Bro, you can't get mad at someone for not wanting to date an individual who used to be a dude. That's so backwards.
Lmfaoo who made this?!!

You gettin wifed. 
Go go go. 
Partaking in bitter talk about an ex never helps. That's just a hole that you're making deeper for yourself.
In black twitter, you can see that the "top tweeters" are still hurtin over their exes. They stay entertainin that hurt via their tweets.
@LostNtheForrest that's time wasted to me, Imo. But I see where you coming from.
A lot of the people who stay throwing shade at exes on here are not over em. There's truth behind those "jokes." This is fact.
It's all good.
I haven't spent more than a month and some change gettin over an ex then I'm back to just livin life as usual.
I'm hella grateful for my friends and family and music. They make getting over a failed relationship hella easy.
At the end of the day, you two just weren't right for one another. Stop dwelling on them and continue to move forward.
With hobbies, and A great support system, there's no reason Anyone should be spending so long getting over an ex. Life moves on.
6-12 months is way too much time to spend getting over a relationship. If it takes that long, you're entertaining the pain. Point blank.
Depending on how things went down, I think it's fine to move on fairly from a relationship. 1-2 months is fine to go get over someone.
Lolol bro you're a fool. 
LMFAOOO good job

Thank God there's two parties tomorrow night. Just to be on the safe side, I'll be slightly drunk at one of em vs the other.

Gonna sacrifice so much time to get this work done.
I will not let last semester repeat itself.
@7uic3 Tempting but right now I gotta put my attention on finishing this. I don't do well with handling different projects at once :(
Got my work cut out for me this weekend...
Can we not? 
I'm here for this. 
When I become a rockstar, I'm taking   @majinnina on a trip around the world. But she still prob won't accept me.
Never in a thousand years, I'd think id write the songs I wrote/am writing now.
This isn't funny. 
Hmm...this is generated. And supposedly, Big Sean wasn't even there. 
@ZeohBleu3 to do•
I also want to ensure that this EP is as flawless as possible. So I don't have a choice but yo do what's necessary to make it so.
But you can't have your way all the time as a leader. When working with others, you need to make things work so everyone's on the same page.
Growing up, I hated the idea of being a leader. But now I'm right back in a position where I need to show leadership. And already it's hard.
@wannabehxc is one of the only accounts active on my TL. Go 2 bed.

I'm so confident in my skills as a song writer.

Funny, I was really against Scorpion Rain but since I love Zeo so much, I'm willing to let that be it's closure.
It only makes sense that Zedd tried taking on the Zeo rangers one last time before deciding to call it quits.
At the end of Zeo.•
To be honest, as much as I hate to admit it, Scorpion Rain might as well be in continuity. Rita and Zedd hyped up their come back so baddd.
Judd Lynn gotta make it so the Zeo rangers come back in a future season.
I just watched two videos and didn't even laugh. 
Ppl spent all this time bitchin at Apple for black emojis and the minute it happens, both black and white ppl use it to act stupid. Amazing.
@UnknownNeo on word she is, bro.
Black beauty. 
One reason I subscribed to funimation is because using 3rd party anime sites is a got damn pain.
Funimation is getting some sweet titles this spring.
Been watching a lot more anime than usual. So spending the extra 8 dollars a month is so worth it.
I hate niggas.

@ITZelda_tails This was the first release that got them on my radar, actually. Very impressive.
@ITZelda_tails Its just a perfect song. Brave brothers killed it with the production too.
@enimsadelocin Your account got hacked, dear.
@ITZelda_tails Its the best song on Like A Cat.
@Nadie_Yenka He signed on to that movie and the next 2. That's not a legitimate excuse imo :/
@313Doe I believe he should've been. He wouldn't even be Drift King without Hahn/that was his boy. Its only right.
Sean should've been a part of that mission. NO not because Tokyo Drift is my fav movie but it makes sense.
Only complaint I have is that Sean from Tokyo Drift was in the movie for ONE SCENE.
Furious 7 was amazing. It did everything that i hoped it would do and the Paul Walker tribute was tear jerking.
OMW TO SEE FURIOUS 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_elizzzabeth_ you're killin me lol
@_elizzzabeth_ still has yet to face time me.
Alright. Back 2 work tomorrow.
Back on campus.
“@DedosLindos: “@gale1501: 
And that they really liked how I played.
I want to take smash more seriously. I was playing with friends last night, who are better than me and they said I had potential.
Bumpin Kalafina, omw to the train station. Thank you again Anime Boston for a great weekend.
GET IN GEAR! #AnimeBoston @Rangerboard 
Meanwhile, as I was in Anime Boston, the road towards the EP completion continued. Jami, you go girl. 
Kill la kill may not be a fav but I def had to take a pic with this cosplayer. 
Lemme try and squeeze in a few hours of sleep,
Those ppl are bad news. Especially drunk.
And as of yesterday, if I know my Brodie is gonna have around the same set of ppl from yesterday, we ain't chillin.
I'm very thankful that i had another group of friends to hang with at AB. If not, I prob would've left early due to frustration.
Ion know..
Plays a role too?
And you can test god with this tithing thing too, which is also what I did when I decided to try this. Still nada...but I guess patience
Almost instantly, according to their stories. Something isn't adding up.
And you'll get what you give back but more. Tried, while believing and everything, nada. But ppl who've told me bout it get theirs back
I decided to stop being hard headed and try it out cuz it's supposedly your duty as a devout Christian to give 10 percent of what you Get
I'm really here debating with myself if I should continue tithing.
What is Iggy saying in these videos bro? Got damn...rapping is not for you. Sit down.
Now the issue remains of getting back to school...
Thank you for a wonderful weekend full of memories I can hold on to. Until next time. @AnimeBoston

Worst thing about these posts is that ppl I genuinely like on here are RTing em. And I'm hella close 2 blocking em.

“@SquirtleSquad7: Buying munchkins for our people here. This sucks.” The struggle.
@_elizzzabeth_ alright.
“@_elizzzabeth_: Legit in a state of no-give-a-fuckery right now” ok.
I really wouldn't mind putting money towards impoverished neighborhoods as a rockstar.
@Morphin_K You are my fav person right now. My fav 2 episodes ever.
Jk I like being single.
I'm faithful, give bomb foot massages and am very nice. Yet, I'm single. This is straight bull.
Mood 
“@BoxUrFaceOff: Such great character designs 
I'll be done with composing by early summer at best. I for see a release date geared towards the end of he year for the EP.
It's scary cuz I can see her freaking out on stage while performing this.
It's really nice to have a partner when composing challenging songs. My vocalists ideas fit so damn well with this one.
Lemme sleep
As this song comes together with each passing night, I feel myself more and more being back at that night in September.....

@PikaChulita especially if it's consensual,respectful and mutual.
@PikaChulita private. Shit happens sometimes.
@PikaChulita I think if their under 18 then it's an issue but if not, then whatever Imo. It's just a matter of keeping what y'all do
I personally don't see an issue with teachers and students having sex. Especially if both are of age and responsible/respectful.

This is what happiness is 
@CobraMagick that's called boss ass writing.
Same ppl who hate Tokyo Drift hated power rangers after they switched the cast. In both cases, the franchise got better after.
@CobraMagick simply cuz the original cast wasn't in it.
@CobraMagick it's my all time favorite. It's the only one next to the first that focuses on cars and that story is amazing. Ppl hate it
@DrellyFish real nigga.
Everyone who bashes Tokyo drift is gonna feel hella stupid when they finally show how it's tied in to the story.
I swear if @DrellyFish trolls Fast and furious fans this weekend, I'm blockin and fading him.

Looks like I'll be taking another 2 week break from writing. With all I have due, I can't be creative.
And I'm not taking bout creators and such, I mean the Stan's/weeabos.
And do that, I really find it hard to delve that much in certain fandoms. There's ppl who's lively hoods are these interests.
