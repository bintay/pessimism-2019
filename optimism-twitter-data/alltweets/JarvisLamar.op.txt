My black ass never follows my gut instinct.
I basically got dressed up just to stand in the line at the club for 20 minutes.
I had a gut feeling about tonight.
So my night didn't go exactly as planned.
Missy Elliott &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
@PlutoSnipes no that's for everyone else nigga.


@Rare_estilo2 lol I'd have to look more into Dallas before I make the decision for the rest of us
@Rare_estilo2 I don't know about Dallas
@Rare_estilo2 we're slowly but surely coming to the light
I'm still procrastinating
Most of us hide in the shadows  
Guess I'll shower and get ready.
One part of me wants to go out and the other half wants to sit around and watch Netflix.
@TaiQuonLee alright
Being lazy and procrastinating.
I'm debating hard about going out.
@erica_villalta oh shit that's crazy
If there ain't no justice, then they're ain't no peace.
Listen to BALTIMORE by Prince3EG on #SoundCloud 
I wish I was there!!!!!!!!! 
I like the song more and more as I listen to it.
Pretty Girls | Britney Spears ft. Iggy
Work went by so fast I swear I was there for an hour and a half.

@BlacNino_ tuh
@BlacNino_ he did it for me
When you tell bae you'll give him some if he shoots the winning shot in the game 
Should I cook breakfast or get some breakfast?
That's all I watch when I have nothing else to watch.
Boondocks has became my go to show on Netflix.
Okay my job hunting is done for now. I need to get up and get ready for work.
@erica_villalta so there isn't anymore over night stockers?
I wish I knew more people I could network with.
@erica_villalta I thought it would have gotten better
@erica_villalta I'll never look back LOL. What made you quit?
I'm up so I might as well do something useful and look for jobs.
But I'll probably end up going after work later on.
I rather go one a Wednesday or Thursday.
I hate going to the mall when it's clustered and busy.
I think it's funny how I have time to go to the mall on the weekends now but I still don't end up going.
What other movie can I watch because I'm obviously not going back to sleep.
I don't have any business up anyway.
Should I finish my movie I slept on or go back to sleep?
Randomly woke up
BLOOP 
I really want to finish this movie tonight since I didn't get to yesterday but I already know as soon as I finish eating I'm gonna KO
Time to listen to #PrettyGirls again. <HEADPHONE>

Fuck it. I'm ordering wings, watch a couple of movies, and calling it a night.
Suppose to be going out for drinks but I'm getting sleepy waiting.
@koolkidtino @charlesego1 true as well
Both still cute........ 
Bout to delete my kik again.
What place in Houston has good drinks and good food?
I got plans for today!
Today has been such a good day.

Just posted a photo 
I wish I had plans tonight.
That's why I find it so hard to trust people because everyone is on some fuckboy shit.
Have some kind of fuckin' respect.
If you have a boyfriend or talk to someone heavily, DO NOT HIT ME UP.
@rayneclowdd gracias
When you're night owl af 
@Deonte__James Whhhhaaaat?
Rihanna really went back to fire engine red or is that just a edited photo?
Xavier NEVER texts back and that's why we not that cool now.
Been at my best friends house forever.
I tried my best to be upbeat and happy at work today but people stay trying it.
I'm so glad to be home and get away from my job.
I'ma just have to start speaking up and not hold anything back.
Why do the littlest things bother me?
If my tears mean nothing don't insult me with lies.
So nasty. So rude.  
@missnatalienunn we need to link up
How long are you here for @missnatalienunn?

That one person you love to hate and hate to love.
Just heard from the last person I would ever want to hear from.
@VIIXXIVXCI nah not at all
FAKE. Her head is from a candid. 
We love you. Even the ones who won't admit it love you.  
Didn't want to tell y'all told you so but........
So Kylie Jenner admitted to having lip fillers.
The Game serious as fuck tho 
I see what they were trying to do but yeah this is lame. 
There's an actual pic of me and Zayn together. <SMIRKING FACE>
@ElijahTSmith 
To everyone who thinks they have @zaynmalik but deep down they know what's up. 
@ElijahTSmith oh but he is.
But I think it's best that we come out and say it... Me and @zaynmalik are happy together.
For the longest I didn't because I didn't want to see all his groupies and what not.
I finally followed my boyfriend on Twitter.
Just posted a photo 
Round of applause to my followers that post actually photos of themselves, their art, or funny memes. Fuck everyone else who do shoutouts.

Shut that shit up real quick.
Trying to hurry up and get off so I can hear @AZEALIABANKS in the remix for Trap Queen.
@DrenchedNPink it's less stressful and what not
I'm trying to be more optimistic about things and more happy.
I actually had a good time at work today.

Every single person SLAYED. 
Anyone who has the link to @rihanna performing at #MetGala send it this way please.
Every single celeb I have seen from #MetGala2015 has kill't it. Literally every single one.
She better slay that fuckin' red carpet. 
Never add a coworker on social media especially if they're older.

Monday's.................... 
Needed this mini break.
Enjoying every moment in San Antonio.
@amazinglyZander you have to know someone that sells them and/or does the change to the skin
Stuck between these three colors. 
I'm debating if I should change the skin of my phone to all black or black and gold........
I'm sleep but I can't sleep.
Just texted my supervisor telling her I won't be able to make it to work tomorrow. Hopefully I don't get in trouble.
Fighting this sleep so I might as well just take my ass to bed.
It's been a long two days.

I hate that you're not performing for the #BBMAs.  
Bye. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Mostly down
My mood has been up and down all day today.
LOVE her 
Deleting old pics on IG.
@ZayXtraordinare you'll never know until you go out there and test the waters
@ZayXtraordinare well waiting on someone else could make you miss out on someone greater.
I think you should explore what's out there  

Yep 
<SMIRKING FACE>
Choosing a movie and figuring out what to eat are the two most difficult things for me.
@ZayXtraordinare I was clearly agreeing
P l e a s e 
<OK HAND SIGN>üèæ 
I can tell I'll be up for awhile. I got so much on my mind.
I had to drive all around my neighborhood because I swear I was being followed.

Just posted a photo 
@britneyspears so no Billboard performance?
I haven't watched this movie in awhile.
@UknowErikaJay @xkingdomi -______-
I was listening to Sam Cooke in the shower and it made me want to watch The Help.
@xkingdomi we are one
I actually want to but the entire series just to have as a memorabilia.
I'm mad they only made one movie out of the series and didn't finish it.
Those were hands down the best books to read.
OHMAN! My all time favorite book series when I was younger was A Series of Unfortunate Events.
Same!  
Luckily I collect movies and have a whole stash to look at.
THEN on top of that the internet/cable is out until Friday. <POUTING FACE>
When you can't wait to get home but there's someone there to fuck up the mood

@HakeemCurry @missnatalienunn @MrJacobPayne oh yeah I thought she was gorgeous before but now that she's happy in her skin she's even better
I'm so glad they're allowing us to use our phones at work again.
Make sure y'all pick up Life&amp;Style's issue featuring @missnatalienunn and her story about how she dropped 25lbs. 
I wish I could just call in.
Just fell asleep for like 30 seconds.
I don't think I'll get to watch a movie tonight.
Besides Kill Bill I'm not really sure.
What movie would I give a 10 to? Hmmm
My eyes can't even stay open at the moment
Might end up sleep on the floor
Debating porn first or shower first.
Ehh 
It might be a sign. I just might be better off with my own race.
Only black guys like me and it's so annoying. I want to explore other races but it's like an anti barrier around me.
I would so be down with the swirl if the swirl was down with me.
Who are you? What are you?
I don't trust private accounts.
Felt like being a dick for a moment
Xavier.............. Shut up. 
I hope changing my eating habits help me gain the weight I want.
Look at how stunning Mo'nique looks? Check her the fuck out!!!
Photoset:  
Wasn't going to workout this late but I'm tryna get my body right and @missnatalienunn got me feeling inspired.
I'ma have to delete some apps for a day so I won't be so bothered.
I can never reply fast enough because everyone wants to text at the same time.
I fuckin' hate how my hair looks right now.
@sadtacos photogrid
I wish I could blink my eyes and things could happen.
@sadtacos to put them in a collage?

@UknowErikaJay oh I'm sorry. Wrong person.
Let's take the time out to wish the most ignorant person in the world a happy birthday @UknowErikaJay 
@iamdrewww_ it was really good
This is my third time watching #RHOAReunion
<SMIRKING FACE> 
I will admit when something I've cooked isn't that good and tonight my meal wasn't all that.

Radio (UK) - 6 days
Worldwide Release - 7 days
Music Video - 13 days
Performance - 19 days 
I don't think anyone understands how happy I am to see Splice on Netflix. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
And this ain't even have of it. Y'all sleeping on @AZEALIABANKS 

Ok........... 
@prettyHANSOM I thought it was pretty useful especially since it has those.
@prettyHANSOM it comes in handy when I want to catch up on old shows like I Love New York
@DOMONlC @prettyHANSOM but what about shows that don't come on TV anymore?
@prettyHANSOM come on I think it's still pretty decent tho
Blasphemy  
Open your eyes and not your mouths. Raise your arms and not your tongue. #BlackLivesMatter
So right now, at this point in time, at this very moment, look around you... Notice this is blood of black men and women on the streets.
Don't come at us with #AllLivesMatter nonsense. When women fought for their rights to vote it was about women NOT men.
Basically if we say #BlackLivesMatter then Black lives matter.
Just read a quote on Tumblr saying, "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor."

@SumLikeA_King I'll try them next

Which country has the best movies on Netflix?
I've been wanting to watch Splice for the longest but @netflix doesn't want to cooperate.
It's like the '92 LA riots all over again.
HAAA! <NO ENTRY SIGN><PALM TREE> 
I don't have a set up for what days to work out on but it'll most likely be in the morning.
I can't have fast food during the week and have to workout.
So I'm suppose to being eating better and trying to gain weight.
Someone told me it was wired that I like whoever likes my photos. What's wrong with that? Ain't that showing love?

KD is Joc's suga mama.
A prostayute, a yunkie.
Finally they bring Joseline #LHHATL
Ever since my granny had my fried fish one time she always wants me to cook some.
I'm going to make a plan where I apply to at least 15 jobs a day.

The shadiest grey there is. 
Andy knows damn well what he's doing when he ask the other girls about someone else they don't like.
None of these ladies should be wearing white. I need them in all black or red. Nothing but negative energy on the reunion.
Come through Miss inspector gadget.
Claudia get her together
Things just got better when Porsha came out.
"Miss lady from Twitter" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That was a yes. Apollo has put his hands on her.
On every show no matter what it is the cast usually ends up on good terms and then bout time the reunion comes everyone's mad at each other.
It sucks to see the reunion and no one is getting along but the shade is so good. #RHOAReunion
Nene does do wrong when ever she gets in her feelings.
Nene and Kandi on the reunions are everything.
Kandi is the type that'll chill until it's time to release the truth. She will bite your neck off with her honesty. #RHOAReunion
The best reunion show #RHOAReunion
Anyone seen them or Altar on Netflix? Any good?
I should honestly be washing my car.

If the place had wifi I would be okay but they don't -____-
I'm suppose to have music for my granny's birthday party and I have nothing.
I thought my music downloading apps would work on my old phone but they are useless.

About to watch Hellraiser 2.

Instead of the usual fast food I get before work. I'll get a fruit smoothie and salad.
I want it 
Eating these stale ass chips
No food! <WEARY FACE>
Well... Got up only to disappoint myself.
Anything sounds good right now.
Some Ramen noodles sound good.
I actually want some oatmeal. <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
I really want to look for something to eat but I know if I look and there's nothing I'ma be pissed.
My stomach is growling for real. Why am I so hungry? <PERSEVERING FACE>
Damn a nigga hungry
It was like being in a boot camp almost.
Did cross fit today and that shit was something to not play with.
I wake up late, work throughout the day, and then come home. I don't even check in until midnight.
I don't really know what social media looks like durning the day anymore.
My phone is worthless around these hours.
I would want some ice cream when they have Blue Bell on recall -____-

What's IG looking like........
I love seeing Rih's old tweets
I'm not really sure what to watch on Netflix so I'll probably just look at Boondocks for the time being.
@SammieBlakeHim I'm not really sure. I guess over using it.
My phone is always hot.
But I'm not leaving my house for shit.
I'm craving some kind of snack.
As much as I wanna leave that job they are the nicest people I've EVER worked with.
So I texted my coworker and they only called to ask what kind of sandwich I wanted. 
What should I eat before I go in to work?
Favorite filter on Snap is black and white. That's the only good filter they have honestly.
I'm hoping she puts it on there tho. Just for me.
@Imma_Twit_On_U is be there now........ But I'm not
That's one of her best songs and it's probably not going to make it to her next album.
I don't think many people have listened to As Real As You And Me.
@sirgagalooXO yeah it was okay.
I can't get into American Oxygen for some reason.
Replace American Oxygen for As Real As You And Me from the Home soundtrack.
Honestly Rih can leave American Oxygen off.
I just know James Joint and Higher are going to be my faves. #R8
I guess I can call my job back... In about 15 minutes.
@godismikey 
@godismikey you ain't ever asked 
I hope they don't think I'm coming in early again today.
@godismikey I wish they didn't

Not watching Bates Motel nor The Skinny. I'm not getting anything accomplished tonight.

Speaking it into existence.
I'll probably never get to meet Britney or Rihanna as a big stan but maybe as business partners or some shit.
I don't like how Marina is rubbing it in my face. Britney is MY teen idol. I'M the fanboy.

Are y'all watching SB tweeting? He is going on on Nicki and Meek. Like calling Meek out and posting Nicki nudes.
Lately my WiFi has been acting a fool.

Everyone fake as shit. The last six people I've texted did not reply.
I texted you Sunday............ No reply. 
I didn't reply to any of my messages when I woke up. I'll reply later at a decent time.
*yawns in disbelief*
I don't block numbers. I just don't reply nor read.
Look at the bullshit
Had to pull the time out and everything. 
Reasons why I don't deal with Xavier:
He full of it.
He has chronic diarrhea.
He chews on his toe nails.
He a tramp...........

This leftover pizza was only good for one day after. Right now it's all dried the fuck up.
Go to bed <UNAMUSED FACE>
But the way things are setup I have to find one that offers a lot.
Wish I could find a job that would help me out career wise.
Feels good to finally eat. Lost my appetite earlier because of someone foolishness.
I don't even know what kind of job I want specifically. I just something that'll pay good until the end of the year.
@AyKerioShep right
Up looking for jobs.
Woke up still feeling blah.
My mood went from <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> to <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I'm starting to actually prefer almond milk over regular milk.
@_iStan4Rihanna the teal color is cute but have you thought about a grayish/silver color?

Who to listen to on Tidal while I shower...?
I take late showers because I don't like to get in the bed unless I've showered. I don't go to bed until super late so hats my reason.
9/10 I'll take a late shower.
Putting up some clothes then I need to shower and get in the bed.
@Imma_Twit_On_U  trying to think why didn't I take my usual nap because it surely was hot.
@Imma_Twit_On_U same here but today I didn't get a nap so I don't know why I'm up
@Imma_Twit_On_U oh and out have to be up early!? At least I sleep in until 12.

@ChristopherDH92 I've never exchange one word with this guy. I'm not sure how he found me. He just sends dick pics randomly.
I'm about to have it blank.
I can't make up my mind about what picture I actually want to use as an AVI.
Isn't it May? 
I'm watching #LHHNYReunion again and I'm noticing it's kinda boring.

This leftover pizza is making love to me.

I was obsessed with Qwanell from Day26. <PERSEVERING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@ShyRonnie_RN it was one artist I couldn't find the other day tho. Can't remember who it was.

If my job would let me I'd dye my hair silver/greyish color or a light teal.
If you don't reply back... Neither do I.
Remy you should have dipped out on this reunion. #LHHNYReunion
Y'all tryna play the fuck out of Remy and it ain't cute. #LHHNYReunion
The whole Yandy and Remy shit is beyond scripted, made up, fake, and beyond unnecessary.

Erica and that forehead vein #LHHNYReunion

Others might know their followers.
That's my personal intake on it tho.
You know who you follow on Twitter and IG but on Tumblr you're just there to reblog and express.
Tumblr followers are so different from IG and Twitter followers.

@BeyondMAJOR same when it's time
@BeyondMAJOR use it more
Time for Tumblr.
Okay, Twitter's boring me.
Most of what I listen to I have on my iTunes.
I'm glad I got Tidal but I don't feel like I use it to it's full potential.
So I just tend my business and trick myself into thinking they're not cute.

I get more mentions from spam accounts than anything else <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I always get weird spam accounts in my mentions.
I guess that's a sign I should go grocery shopping.
Lately I haven't had any good snacks around.
Anyone catch #RBDivasLA?
Putting it on paper is like speaking things into existence.
My mind is always brainstorming these ideas of what I want to do next. I mess that up by not putting it on paper.
I'm tempted to go out and get me a quick bite to eat but I'd be doing too much.
We have something in common... 
I'ma have to delete it sooner than I thought.
Earlier I was trying to figure out how am I using so much data and I think it's because of Tidal.

If change is necessary then just let it happen.
I'm not used to big changes and I get overwhelmed about it. But I think it's better to just let things happen naturally.
It's on TV and I finally got to watch it again.
Ever since one of my professors made the class watch Office Space I'm always looking for it on Netflix.
I'll be up for awhile
Just posted a photo 
Just woke up and the first thing on my mind is food.

Louie 13 and it's all on me nigga you just bought a shot.
I feel like I'm always overwhelmed.
Porn 
I like both but I can't decide which is better.
Which is better 21st Jump Street or 22nd?
Is a pig's pussy pork?
I think I hold my tongue a little bit too much.
This part nearly snatched me bald @rihanna 
I might be an ass but I do miss cuddling every so often.
Today was the most weirdest day ever

@godismikey 
Enough Tumblr for the night.
@godismikey you mutha fucka
@godismikey 
I'm mad I didn't get to pull an April Fools prank. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@godismikey my face is already fixed 
Is the #BlackOut every first Friday of the month?

Mikey is such a perv
@godismikey 
@godismikey that sounds better 
Anyone else used to fuck with Stacie Orrico?
@godismikey 
And that was like... 7 or 8 years ago.
The last Spike Lee movie I bought was School Daze.
I need another Spike Lee movie.
@godismikey well then what do you have in mind?
I know I missed R&amp;B Divas this week but I think I missed it last week also.
@godismikey I mean I thought you liked that kind of stuff. I was trying to be cute. 
Or else I won't give the other album a chance to be heard and be liked enough to listen to it again.
I have to have time to let one album sink in before I get another.
I want to just buy a whole bunch of different albums one day but it's so many I've been wanting to hear that I just couldn't.
@godismikey 
Tumblr, you're the best.
@godismikey well I was going to just make a bowl of cat shit with soy milk. Thought you'd like it more than a prepared meal.
@godismikey does it have to be a catch?
@godismikey well something like that
@godismikey I don't go in until one but I was planning on waking up early for some reason but i can't remember.
I did so well yesterday by going to bed early but here I am today wide awake at 3:22 in the morning.

It was depressing honestly because I was really hungry.

Just because your vagina stinks doesn't mean everyone else's does.
@ThisGuyReckless happens EVERYTIME literally. Sometimes I'll like one or two but not enough to upload so they just stay unused in my album.
I really like the black one tho so I'm gonna have to get it for the summer.

@KENLushh 
@KENLushh 
Naomi had an album in 1994 but only released in the UK.
Correction... One album.
I did not know Naomi Campbell had three albums. <FLUSHED FACE>
@_DaddyOnDeck you tried tho LOL
I just might post the pics on Tumblr... It's not too too bad. I don't think... <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Spazzing!!!

Soooooo Ice Princess by @AZEALIABANKS is coming out 3/31!!!
@_DaddyOnDeck 
LOL
Ever since I left my job I had for four in a half years seems like all the other ones don't last.
@ryanwhitec tried finding one that wasn't TOO much but they're all TOO much
Alright so I know I just started this job in December but I'm ready to find another one.
I took some really cute selfies earlier but they're not appropriate at all.
But then you notice you the only one dancing

I'm trollin' for a picture of Rih, Bey, and Nicki. Y'all know damn well your fans waiting for it.
What if that were Rih instead? I would have DIEEEEDDDDD 
I couldn't go to bed on time even if you paid me to.
Seriously she has no filter whatsoever.
I was on Tumblr and someone posted some of @rihanna's clapbacks and I was choking on some of the shit she said. #Clapbackgametoostrong
I can't lie tho doing some things alone is therapeutic.
Lately I've been spending all my time by myself which is no biggie but damn it does get lonely.
Everyone is always so busy now.
I take that back. I do have the time but no one to spend it with.
I hardly have time to do what I want anymore.

I did however use a filter but thats about it.
Clarification. My AVI is what it is. I walked outside and used the sky as a background. I didn't slap it behind my head with some edit.
It's not a background it's the sky. ‚Äú@sirgagalooXO: @JarvisLamar question; how'd you get the background for your avi?!‚Äù
This is the link for the #TIDALforALL: 
...music listeners $20 a month to listen to streamed music. I guess they're trying to get rid of illegal downloading.
So what I've learned from my mentions is that #TIDALforALL is going to be this new thing that Jay-Z came up with that'll charge...
@adseban !!!!!!!!!
@KENLushh 
That literally explained NOTHIG ‚Äú@tidalforalI: @JarvisLamar The future of music #TIDALforALL‚Äù
@SammieBlakeHim if you shake your iPhone hard enough the camera will take better pics.
@KENLushh if you put your iPhone in your ass you'll get better connection.
I learned a new trick with my iPhone. I feel so cool and lame at the same time.
Probably not changing it even if I know what it's about.
Not changing my AVI until then.
I need a full explanation of what #TIDALforALL is really about.
#BBHMM #iHeartRadioAwards @rihanna LIVE: 
@rihanna always making the Navy decode messages. 
I really believe this'll be the very best @rihanna we've seen. #R8

Being a troll and going through everyone's pictures looking for Rih's performance.

I felt like I was on stage with Rih.
I was watching @rihanna perform #BBHMM on #iHeartRadioAwards like 
So I seen Home earlier and it was the cutest animated movie then I come home to see Ratchetanna and she did dat.
I wasn't the only one thinking Rih was giving old school Kim. She did Kim justice. Loved it!
Sam Smith and/or Lana Del Rey would be ideal to sing at a wedding... Preferably mine.
Okay I was obviously here for Rih but Sam Smith is is just <WEARY FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Sam Smith is everything!!!
Give it to ANYONE but Iggy!

@_DRFoster I'm so nervous
What is this @IGGYAZALEA? <UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> 
Justin's speech is the longest speech I've ever watched.
No shade because they're talking about Justin but I just would LOVE to see her perform.
I wish Britney Spears was performing.
I prefer thick Kelly.
Kelly's weight always fluctuates
Speeding home trying to make sure I don't miss @rihanna #iHeartAwards
@_DRFoster THANKS!!!
@_DRFoster lemme know when she performs PLEEAAASSEEE
Has Rihanna performed yet?
You get to dream about a phenomenal person that is everything. Then you wake up realizing you'll never see that person again.
Those are the best dreams and the worst dreams at the same time.
Last night I had a dream about a guy that I had never met.
Listening to the Home soundtrack before I watch it in a few.
As Real As You And Me | Rihanna

@DruChaos @Tesa4Life @YogiDaB OOP... I'm not here for this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@DruChaos @YogiDaB getting Diddy's douche ready
I guess I'm taking myself to the movies and then grab a quick bite.
I gotta get up
Diddy a whole bottom ‚Äú@YogiDaB: So Diddy's ass is just going to be all up in French Montana's crouch? 
A little jealous  
My fingertips smell like pennies. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
I have to trick myself into thinking I can wake up on time in the morning.
I hate having nice looking followers who are straight.
So I decided to get a mini exercise in before I took a shower.
Alright lemme take this shower
My tea sipping skills are <OK HAND SIGN>

@_DRFoster go to sleep LOL
@_DRFoster -____-
I want a whole meal.
I woke up hungry and realized I have nothing to eat but cereal.
@Dancerholic93 what
I knew I wasn't going out tonight.
Was suppose to have taken a nap but too much is on my mind.
@AZEALIABANKS can work that ass? Never knew hunni! The cunt is ratchet. 
<THUMBS UP SIGN>

*sighs* I'm such a thot.
I really want to go out later tonight but I have to see what's my mood.
I doubt if I'll watch a movie tonight.
Bout to take this shower and head to bed.
I wish I would have watched what I originally wanted to watch at the theaters. Now I have to go again tomorrow.
I hate driving for a long periodicly time <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Friendswood is so fuckin' far yo.

There was also a lot of dead space in the movie. Scenes that could have been shortened or taken out.
@PlutoSnipes worth watching once it comes to DVD.
It's one of those movies that some teen in high school with a HD camera made.
It's just some random movie with no real story line.
Full warning, don't expect any explanation about what's going on through out the movie.
It wasn't scary but it is going to be a cult classic.
It Follows was such a weird movie.
I don't have any friends anymore on Snap <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
What's wrong with Snapchat? 
Happy 15th Birthday #OopsIDidItAgain @britneyspears. This video was one of my FAVORITE childhood memories.

I'm so happy it's Friday.
I'm getting more and more comfortable embarrassing myself.
There were two things I was suppose to do this week and have failed to do either.
*needs more sleep.
Oh well. She tried.
Never seen an artist that took so much bashing like Iggy has.
Man I wonder what Iggy's plans are for a second album?
Byyyyeeeee <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
Cus right now I could go for some snacks and a powerade.
I should just buy a mini fridge to put in my room.
Cruel Intentions is such a sick twisted movie but it's so good.
I wanna go to the movies and then out for drinks this weekend.
So then I thought about maybe an off white or a grayish color.
Thinking of doing a light blue but my bathroom is light blue.
I went to look for some paint today for my room and the options are endless. I don't even know what color I want anymore.
Okay enough music for the night.
The video for this one was my faaaave
