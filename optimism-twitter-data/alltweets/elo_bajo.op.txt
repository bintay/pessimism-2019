@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll Cheating is different than fixing.  The outcome is not predetermined.  Can cheat and still lose.
@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll The opposite is also true. Has been cheating, steroid use in NFL, MLB &amp; even Olympics. PPL watch

@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll not to mention that it is more heinous than cheating.  Esp a minor infraction like a deflated ball
@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll honor and integrity of the NFL damaged greater by off field violence.
@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll crimes draw outcry from PPL who don't even watch sports. It gives them a bad rep they don't want.
@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll the time.  Look at all the steroid users.  PPL never really tune out b/c of that, but viollent...
@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll But these incidents do make some PPL want to tune out more so than cheating. athletes cheat all...
@MikeCF811 @GriffinKamran @hunter_troll I agree he should've seen jail time. &amp; Even that media should focus more on legal system than NFL...
@GriffinKamran @MikeCF811 @hunter_troll Bad rule IMO, but he still broke it. Not a Pats fan or hater but shud B harsher on domestic violence
@GriffinKamran @MikeCF811 @hunter_troll And honestly, even if it was in SB... domestic violence is bigger &amp; WAY worse. No comparison. Sorry
@GriffinKamran @MikeCF811 @hunter_troll Wasn't in SB. Even Colts said it didn't affect outcome of game. Some things R bigger than football.
@MikeCF811 @hunter_troll It DOES hurt the league, b/c it has developed a bad reputation due to violence and criminal acts off the field.
I can't believe #NFL would suspend Brady for #NFLKickoff on Thurs night.
I will crack up is suspension stands &amp; #Pats go 4-0.
#NFL suspends Tom Brady 4 games &amp; #Cowboys fans R throwing a party b/c won't have to face him. How bout u beat him in big spot, like #NYG?
NFL suspends Tom Brady for 4 games 
PPL R so disrespectful.  I put garbage can out for pickup. After its done some inconsiderate jerks treat it like its a public receptacle.

@Patricia_Traina was really trying 2B silly b/c I said Id like 2hear about him. Obviously not a rook but was reported he showed up 4 rehab
@Gasface732 no thank you lol
@Patricia_Traina I know that.  I just meant  there was a Cruz sighting and some news.
@Patricia_Traina So I heard Cruz showed up to mini camp.  I may have been vindicated lol :)
Kent Graham's son is at #Giants rookie mini camp on a tryout? Sheesh.  DOn't wanna be mean, but I hope he's better than his old man was #nyg
@DGoodmantrublu I hopeful and optimistic.  Cruz &amp; OBJ will be a nightmare for DBs

@DGoodmantrublu That 1st SB... they came out "as a team" instead of introducing the "O" or "D" starting lineups.
@DGoodmantrublu Could argue that Viniateri delivered the wins to D and O lol.
@DGoodmantrublu Yeah, Bledsoe threw a TD in that game. He evolved 4 sure, but also lead them on a last min game winning drive.
@DGoodmantrublu Oh the first one... I could see that.  But even then, it was a big difference between him and Bledsoe. Pats had a great D
@DGoodmantrublu Oh yeah.  Brady was along for the ride.  Gimme a break.  You're confusing him for Dilfer.
Should let the #deflategate go already. Look. They did it.  Don't really think it helped them win that much. Bad rule IMO, but still a rule.
What do you expect Ted Bruschi to say?  He's a Patriot.  And thankful to Brady for delivering  3 rings to him. Let;s be real.
@Patricia_Traina Oh sorry. I misread that.  How about Matt LaCosse or one of the other rookie TEs?  Still think there's an opportunity there

@FFGuidance I think I would say Ronnie Lott, IMO. Also Rod Woodson off the top of my head. But that isn't exactly a knock on Ed Reed.
a) Upset rival potentially made good OL better. That's fair.
b) Saying NYG…
@DanGrazianoESPN @art_stapleton LOL!
@keithmontesano Yeah... it's a PR issue too.  No one wanted to be the team that drafted a murder suspect.  Even tho he wasn't a suspect.
@BigBlueUnited @LarrySoprano I suppose.  RB bigger issue.  McFadden never plays 16.
@LarrySoprano @BigBlueUnited The thing is... I don't get why Dallas needs him.  OL was a position of strength for them.
@keithmontesano w/the Aaron Hernandez situation &amp; even the Ray Rice/Greg Hardy scandals, teams were obviously really hesitant.
@GiantInsider I think he will start in Dallas too.
@keithmontesano At the very least they could prob have kept him off another roster by doing that. If u want to play that game.
@keithmontesano He said he would not have signed if he was drafted past the 3rd round
@Cartr1dgeBased you're right.  Shouldn't lump him in w/the other Cowboys
Cowboys signed La'el Collins? Makes sense doesnt matter if he's cleared of any wrongdoing. Plenty of convicts there. OL will be stout tho
I agree w/Beningo.  It's a bad rule, but Brady broke it. #deflategate

@jimmysimpson19 That's what I'm saying! lol
@jimmysimpson19 Yeah, but I don't think they'll enter a bidding war if they already addressed need.
If he is cleared from any involvement, would the Giants show La'el Collins interest after drafting Ereck Flowers? Not so sure. #nyg

Crazy about Lou Lamoriello.  I guess its time. Some fans have wanted #NJDevils to move on from him, but can't dispute his track record.

Mykkele Thompson is only issue. Cld be very good player but even he was surprised. I think #NYG could've gotten him in later rd #giantsdraft
Really like the 1st 3 picks.  Other picks R depth. I think it was a good draft  overall. #giantschat
I think caller is right about mid rounds. Process might be same, but JR takes more risks on projects &amp; "luxury" picks in mid rds #giantschat

@art_stapleton It's a nice story, but I doubt he beats out Nassib &amp; they won't carry 3.  Good exposure for him though.

Jameis Winston signs 4-year deal 

Coughlin was asked what he liked about Odighizuwa... "effort." #nyg
PDOT: Both Landon Collins &amp; Odighizuwa were rated as a 1st round pick at one point. #nyg #nfldraft
@DGoodmantrublu Reese just mentioned that Tuck was also a 3rd round pick as well. #nyg
Odighizuwa = a good piece for SPags'   "D"  not O lol #nyg #giantsdraft
@LGMets31 that I did lol
Reese says Odighizuwa can play DE, but can play inside as well &amp; create matchup problems as an inside pass rusher. #nyg
Odighizuwa should be a good piece in Spags' offense. #nyg #giantsdraft
DE Owamagbe Odighizuwa from UCLA #NYG 3rd round pick
Randy Gregory is a good pick by the #Cowboys.. but seriously loading up on troubled players. Rolando McClain, Greg Hardy. Gregory = boyscout
If he's still there, #NYG should take Gregory in RD 3.
@BigBlueUnited Wanted 2C him in Blue
Chargers took Denzel Perryman.  Good pick.
Landon Collins said a "Dominant Player" will B showing up 2 #NYG's rookie mini-camp next weekend. Like the confidence 
I hope the G-Men can get another player from the U in RD 3... LB Denzel Perryman.  #nyg #giantsdraft
@anthonypizzarie Me too!
Landon Collins interviewed on 
#NYG still need DL &amp; LB help in draft. Love what they've done so far. #giantsdraft
Think Berhe &amp; Collins will be #NYG's starting Safeties
Makes sense 2B aggressive. If JR is on hot seat wants to get players to make immediate impact -- and 1st 2 picks were need picks. #NYG
@TheChickenHorse Giants have a compensatory pick in RD 7 so it's like they only gave up 1 pick. #nyg
@TheChickenHorse that's why ur complaining. You wanted him in black &amp; gold. U mad bro?
LOVED that former #NYG S Shaun Williams announced the pick! #nfldraft
@TheChickenHorse nah.  I was hoping he'd be there at 9, but that would've been a longshot.  They gave up a 4th &amp; a 7th.  Worth it.
@TheChickenHorse No he wouldn't.  Projected as best safety in the draft. 1st round talent
Still wanted Stevie Brown to re-sign, but love the Landon Collins pick.  Needed a Safety in the worst way. #nyg
@TheChickenHorse needed that safety bad!
@giantswfan I wouldn't touch Collins.  Not worth the risk.
I don't what's more annoying. #youtube ads or the autoplay of some random vid when the video you WANT to see ends.

@TheChickenHorse have a rum &amp; coke &amp; settle down
@TheChickenHorse Yeah... Landon Collins is still out there.  Giants could use a Safety too
Highlights of this Agholor kid are impressive. #nfldraft
Chip Kelly does not draft a Duck?  Something's up! lol #nfldraft
So, starting OL... Flowers, Pugh, Richburg, Schwartz, Beatty? #nyg
@Eflow_74 Welcome to #BigBlueNation!!! #letsgogiants #nyg #canes
@TheChickenHorse Yeah, it's just they get banged up so much &amp; teams pass more now.  Most teams have 2 or 3 headed monster
Good pick by the Vikings #TraeWaynes
@TheChickenHorse 3rd overall in 2012.  He's a bit of a bust.  Had the one big year
So in last 3 drafts #NYG draft 3 OL in 1st 2 rounds (2 in the 1st). Pugh &amp; Flowers... and Richburg rd 2 last yr.
I wish #NFLDraft went 2 rounds tonight.
@TheChickenHorse Giants should've drafted Marinara
I would've preferred Scherff.... but he was gone.  Glad #NYG got an O-Lineman tho.  Should really help Eli &amp; our run game. #giantschat
@DGoodmantrublu lol... just noticed that :/
disappointed about Scherzo... should #NYG draft PEAT now?
@Profile_Scanner If it's him &amp; not much else b/c they traded all their picks it wouldn't be so bad.
@Gasface732 @stefiegirlNYG and Tight End lol
Chip Kelly is gonna pull a Ditka &amp; trade every pick in the #NFLDraft to get Mariota lol
@stefiegirlNYG Reese's idol is the GM who drafted RB George Rogers w/tthe 1st overall pick instead of LT. #nyg

What's the best way to get to Providence #RhodeIsland from #NorthernNJ/ #NYC? I always hit mega traffic when I head to #NewEngland?
#NYG should have some good choices at 9. Scherff, Flowers, Shelton, Peat... at least one of them should be there.
@Patricia_Traina Do you like Stephone Anthony better than Perryman? Or just think Perryman will be gone before #NYG's rd 3 pick?

@bigshow88 They need another Mark Bavaro.  Reliable as a blocker &amp; receiver. #nyg
Plax has been indicted on charges that he failed to pay income taxes. 
I STILL think #NYG needs a TE.  Donnell shined early on, but quickly faded. It's just that OL, DL &amp; S are more pressing needs. #giantschat

Tonight is the night... who are we getting #NYG? Scherff? Cooper? Shelton? Peat? #nfldraft

@ajcnj56 That's true.  in 2007 Spags' D gave up like 80 points in the 1st 2 weeks. They settled down after that'
@kierg37 I had high hopes for the show &amp; I'm pretty much a sucker for anything superhero/comic book related. Did not meet expectations tho.
@RomeRossny10 They are?  That's dumb.  I heard rumors about an X-Men tv series.  THAT would be something!
@ajcnj56 good point.  Pls divisional matches at the end of the season are exciting
I've given up on Agents of Shield. Arrow, the Flash, DareDevil, &amp; Gotham are all way better.
I don't like #NYG opening season against Dallas. Let the season develop a little bit  before having a major showdown. @anthonypizzarie
@anthonypizzarie Yeah.  Esp for a team coming off losing record. I guess, #NYG being a marquee team w/a 2 time SB MVP @ QB is enough.
@nygindc And they actually won some later games. Can't take opponents for granted, but I think shed is soft.

@DGoodmantrublu @CBMUchamp  oh yeah, that's right.  He's tougher than PPL give him credit for.
@DGoodmantrublu @CBMUchamp True... Pennington, Sehorn come to mind right away.  Tiki gave us a scare one yr but he was OK

@DGoodmantrublu top 3 offense... let's hope. OL will play a big part.
@DGoodmantrublu No doubt. Even if 70% isn't attainable, why not strive for it? His completion percentage improved to the 60s last yr
@RVacchianoNYDN @DanGrazianoESPN He would make a big difference if that's true.

@DGoodmantrublu I like Berhe.  He's not the issue. I just think we need more than that.

This can only mean trouble. Be ready at 8/7c. 
@DGoodmantrublu True. @ least they tried w/McCourty. I guess I don't like the way its shaking out &amp; not hopeful about Safeties in this draft
@DGoodmantrublu We can agree to disagree.  I think they are treating the safety position like the way they have treated LBs &amp; recently TEs.
@DGoodmantrublu If I remember correctly, Stevie Brown even caught a pic in the preseason game he got hurt in lol.
@DGoodmantrublu I would've brought Rolle back.  He's got a yr left. NFL contracts aren't guaranteed anyway. Great locker room presence, Capt
@DGoodmantrublu He had a bad yr no doubt, but some will say schemes had something to do /that too. Bigger problem is his decline in longrun
@DGoodmantrublu I like Berhe, but they have no depth.  Bennett will be an experiment.  I'm not alone in thinking the Giants are thin at S
@DGoodmantrublu Plus thin safety class in draft.  Stevie Brown had EIGHT INTs.  Boy, he has some luck.
@DGoodmantrublu Brown was coming off a surgery &amp; will prob be better b/c takes a yr to recover.  I'd rather have them, then what we got now
@DGoodmantrublu It's one thing to let Antrel walk, but who did they replace him with?  So I do think it makes the group worse.
@DGoodmantrublu Antrel had a down yr, but I think he has something left. Bowman played well.  Stevie Brown led #NYG in INTs before injury
OK.. so Antrel is gone.  Bowman is gone.  Stevie Brown next? #NYG's secondary is getting depleted.
@Patricia_Traina What's not great is that he is leaving the Giants.
Finally a legit nice day

@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg I feel like he did all that when teams weren't paying attention to him. Once they did, he couldn't get open
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg Donnell annoyed me. I was so psyched when started on a hot streak &amp; he disappeared the rest of the season
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg He thinks he's gonna find the next Carl Banks in the 6th round.
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg At least TEs have panned out until recently. Boss, Ballard, Martellus. After that its been shaky
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 When you say Collins you mean La'el or Landon? Cooper might be gone.
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg Reese has neglected the LB position for a long time. tried to find starters in late rounds.. like Sintim
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg Not a lot of safeties in this draft &amp; can't take one at 9. To me, that's a problem #nyg
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg Williams, Wynn, Kennard, OBJ. Not bad draft Enough reaching on "projects" &amp; drafting backup QBs.
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg I think Reese did a good job on the draft last yr. Wynn, Kennard, OBJ. He is on hotseat &amp; not taking risks.
@Giants5john @jtnyg I don't think he's an every down player, but they like to rotate D-Line anyways. I think he still has something left
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john I agree. Just curious what you thought. Lots of G-Men fans would love to see Cooper in blue.
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg They need LB help too... and obviously safety.
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg What if Amari Cooper is still there at 9? #nyg
Headley!!! #nyy
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg Believed to be a versatile lineman 2, that can be moved around on the line based on need. Giants love that
@jtnyg @Giants5john I wouldn't mind seeing them bring Osi back. Not just for nostalgia. Could still be a situational pass rusher &amp; mentor.
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg I think they are thinking w/Spags JPP will shine &amp; players like Moore will blossom. #nyg
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg They need to win the battle up front on both sides of the ball, so Shelton would not be bad either
@Giants5john @jtnyg @JLawrence38 I think O-Lineman is also a safe pick. &amp; They will get an affordable starter 4 many yrs. Vets R  expensive
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg Yeah, they struggled w/out him. That's why I still think they need to shore up the O-Line.
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg Seriously tho, they did better w/Schwartz in the lineup. If he stays healthy it makes a big difference.
@JLawrence38 @Giants5john @jtnyg That's cause if you even look at a WR the wrong way, they call pass interference lol
@Giants5john @jtnyg @JLawrence38 Gotta win the battle up front.
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg They won't draft a Safety at 9.  If they draft a S in rd 1, it means they have traded down.
@jtnyg @Giants5john @JLawrence38 He also says BPA.  If cooper is not there, then he may have to pick between Peat, Collins &amp; Scherff
@Giants5john @JLawrence38 @jtnyg I still say O-Line is the way to go in round 1 #nyg

@Gasface732 I know.  I'm a little torn. I do think PAT is automatic. I like the tradition tho. And takes a FG fake out.
@JaidenEverett @TorontoArgos No doubt. PAT is 32 yd line &amp; if they go for 2 it'll be placed at the 3. #CFL believes more teams will go for 2
Interesting the #CFL has moved the extra point to the 32 yd line. #NFL has considered rules about the PAT

@2016_lar @Gasface732 I was thinking Foles &amp; Bradford, but Foles is gone.
@2016_lar @Gasface732 Oh right... I forgot about him.  I stand corrected lol
Not a Tebow fan, but he's a college style QB for an offense Chip wants to run &amp; has more playoff wins than any QB on the roster.

That could be a scary defensive front in Houston 
@Gasface732 There are some players that are no brainers - and Rose would be one of them -- that shouldn't even go to a vote lol
@Gasface732 yeah, that's the other hurdle.  I forgot about the voters lol.
@Gasface732 No doubt.  He fessed up. He admitted he messed up. Now it's time to forgive &amp; forget.
Alright seriously #MLB needs to get this right &amp; lift the ban on Pete Rose.  w/all the PED use, gambling doesn't seem like such a big deal.

@2016_lar No def not the majority.  But there's always a few bad apples, unfortunately.
@Giants360 @2016_lar LMAO I will say Giants fans are classy &amp; these are in the minority. Either that or they were Eagles fans pretending lol
@2016_lar @Giants360  Check out this old article about Steve Smith's departure &amp; note 2nd tweet: 
@Giants360 Looking back at it tho. I Can't blame him. He was never the same after that injury &amp; he still was able to get paid by the Eagles
@Giants360 I didn't like Bavaro going there, but The Giants weren't gonna re-sign. He had to move on. Same w/Jessie Amsted.
@Giants360 that's def true.  But the Giants usually keep these things in house. The Steve Smith one was just different for me.
@Giants360 So to criticize Smith publicly like that made me feel like he really did us dirty.
@Giants360 I believe Reese was annoyed... and that annoyed me b/c the Giants are usually pretty quiet about stuff like that.
@Giants360 If I remember Steve Smith situation, he was "talking" to the Giants &amp; then signed w/Philly &amp; didn't give NYG chance to match.
@Giants360 really couldn't play anymore, so taking the money from Philly was the right thing for him &amp; actually helped the Giants.
@Giants360 I was annoyed. Just being honest. Not abusive, but really critical of him. In hindsight, considering he really couldn't play...
@2016_lar I remember Kim Jones telling PPL to relax that it's just a biz decision. I think I was more annoyed that he did it in a sneaky way
@2016_lar I didnt do that, but I was annoyed he signed there. Don't remember exactly what was said but he did take a lot of abuse on twitter
@Giants360 Giants fans reacted the same way when Steve Smith went to Philly. I was one of them, lol. I actually still have his Jersey tho.

@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 No doubt.  He's one of those fan favorites that's impressed in limited opportunities.
@RDanaFox @DGoodmantrublu @michaelshekar @Giants360 I like Berhe &amp; LB Kennard.  I think those are 2 young players that can develop.
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 Even DE's though I view as role players, other than JPP who can take over the game
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 AMEN to that! lol
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 Also, no pressure on QB. That's why I think D-Line is an issue. Gotta win battle upfront
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 Not saying he's the answer but I hope Stevie Brown comes bak. Had Lot of e picks that yr
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 Rd 3 would B even better. Id like 2C RD1: OL RD2: LB or DL.  RD3: S. both lines big need
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 They might have to do that
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 Thin draft class for #SAFETY from what I hear.  Think they can land a good one in Rd 2?
Henrique #NJDEVILS 
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 Still, I expect them to stay pat tho
@DGoodmantrublu @RDanaFox @michaelshekar @Giants360 They could also trade down if there's player they covet, but think is a reach at 9

@keithmontesano @CraigSantucci There's still time to do something.  Gotta make their move tho
@EJDeveau Stevie Brown!
@DGoodmantrublu Don't know much about him, so I'll take ur word for it... They need to make their move tho
@DGoodmantrublu Call Gibril WIlson!!! lol j/k
@DGoodmantrublu They need Somebody.  Ron Parker doesn't seem likely
#NYG Should just re-sign Brown &amp; Demps @ this point!
@DGoodmantrublu Still... they got Marshall for nothing, Revis, Cromartie. Even Fitzpatrick isn't great, but def an upgrade. Good offseason
I gotta admit, the Jets are on a tear
I hope the Giants don't mess up this safety position #nyg
@Gasface732 When Schwartz was in there, he was great.  But was in &amp; out of lineup. Hopefully he can stay healthy. He made a difference
Adding a legit veteran starter on OL is too costly.  Draft is the way to go. IF they land Scherff or Peat it would be ideal #giantschat
What's going on w/ Stevie Brown? #giantschat #nyg
@DGoodmantrublu Thanks for the heads up.  I thought it was the real Schefter.  They got me lol
@SpawtsMongo Yeah, was a great collaboration!
@JoeandEvan Eagles traded Foles, but what if Sanchez is the QB they trade to the Jets for pick/Mariota?

@garysanchezjr You never know w/this team lol
@garysanchezjr I think O-Line will be addressed in rd 1 of the draft.  Vets are too expensive if they are legit Studs.
@garysanchezjr I didn't say give him a  5 yr deal lol. Great stop gap player on 1 or 2 yr deal. b/c of age might not be that expensive
#NYG have already signed to former Patriots.  Should go for the trifecta &amp; bring in WIlfork.  Need D-Line help for Spags.
@LGMets31 Yo and me both!
Neithe…
@antrelrolle26 2 Bad it didn't say EWR Newark! lol.  Best of luck champ.
Maybe Chip Kelly traded 4 Bradford to start him &amp; let Mariota watch. He resigned Sanchez to send him back to Jets for the pick 2 get Mariota
@WordOfZac I heard he signed w/the Bears, but apparently he hasn't signed yet.  I think they are moving on from Antrel tho.
#NYG should've locked up Antrel &amp; Brown before Free Agency given the thin safety crop in FA &amp; the draft.
#Jaguars: $166M
#Jets: $95M
#Eagles: $63M

@FrankOfMetal thats 2 bad.  #nyg def needs a safety now
Woh! Foles traded for bradford? Crazy!
@Gasface732 Part of it is that I'm sure they want to keep him out of NE tho
@Gasface732 It worked for Pats b/c it was a 1 yr deal lol
If the Jets sign Revis to anything longer than a one year deal, he will hold out next year, gurranteed #nyj
@NY_Giantsrock @MrRuiz81 plus he's older... price has 2B right, but I'd try to bring WIlfork in.  He's a big boy.
@NY_Giantsrock @MrRuiz81 What about Wilfork?  Would not be upset if they brought him in
@MrRuiz81 @NY_Giantsrock Bring back Barden!  lol
@NY_Giantsrock @MrRuiz81 @Giants We need to sign a safety... very thin position in the draft
@NY_Giantsrock @MrRuiz81 @Giants I actually think draft is better. Vets come at high price &amp; break down. should get quality starter in rd 1
@NY_Giantsrock @MrRuiz81 @Giants I think OL will come in the draft... like rd 1!
Now!
@MrRuiz81 Need OL, DL
@NY_Giantsrock Vereen is a nice addition, but I def agree.  Much bigger needs
DE, DT, LB, OG, OT
#NYG
@Gasface732 Yeah, def need a safety
@Gasface732 Still think O-Line in rd 1 is the way to go.  Can get quality starter much cheaper than signing on the FA market.
wouldn't have targeted, but Vereen = solid HB. He's a good add. Just hope #NYG still get scat back in draft still need O-Line &amp; D-Line help

Report: #Sony Has Plans For Another ‘Ghostbusters’ Film With Dan Aykroyd And Channing Tatum 
@DGoodmantrublu Would like 2C them draft a scat back at least... in later rounds
@DGoodmantrublu At times he looked great and other times not so much. HBs too inconsistent on Pats. Prob gameplan, but affects my perception
@DGoodmantrublu You might be right.  Just think they still need the seed they lost w/David Wilson.
@DGoodmantrublu Part of it is I really like Jennings *IfHealthy -- But recognize need for scat back.  That's not Vereen. #nyg
@cprim23 Yeah, but will be behind Jennings &amp; possibly Williams. Not asking him 2 carry the load
@DGoodmantrublu And think he wants to start, but not sure how much attention he's getting. Might drive asking price down. Has the skill set
I don't like #NYG chasing after these backs Shane Vereen &amp; Roy Helu... would prefer to go after CJ Spiller if anything. More explosive.
Giants 'very serious' about signing RB Shane Vereen 
Bears want to keep Cutler, they should've kept Brandon Marshall too then

Ladanian says Darrelle Revis could return to the Jets like Lebron returned to Cleveland. Its a bit different. He's actually from Pittsburg.
@DGoodmantrublu I'm starting to worry they might draft defensive player in rd 1 instead of OL.  Their FA targets seem to sign elsewhere
@DGoodmantrublu hoping for Peat in rd 1. Would not be upset w/Scherrff
@DGoodmantrublu Would B intriguing move, but would prefer #NYG draft young stud OT that will come cheaper &amp; be their starter for a decade.
A-Rod on 1st multi-hit game: 'Nothing is real significant this time of year' #nyy  
@Gasface732 yeah, which is why the need one in FA.  I hope they bring Stevie Brown back also. #nyg

#Twitter has acquired Periscope, a live-streaming #video service still in beta 
Could use this in my neighborhood! 
@Gasface732 I totally agree! They only prob is I think Spiller will want a starting role &amp; not spell Jennings. But would be a great addition

@stefiegirlNYG @PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg Yeah, but he was good on Sunday, lol
@PGar58 @stefiegirlNYG @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg I think Jerry Jones got in the way in dallas. DOn't think the Tuna wanted T.O.
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg Always took over like a 1-15 team &amp; by the time he left they were contenders. even @ the end
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg I think Parcels' passion became more about turning losers into winners than winning the big 1
@DGoodmantrublu @PGar58 @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg Me neither. I amazes me why so many Giants fans dislike the Pats. No reason 2.
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg OK. I stand corrected, but I know Belichick has gotten the better of him in general
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg if BB didn't sweep Tuna he has winning record 4 sure, but I think Parcels never beat him.
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg Cleveland eliminated Parcells' Pats from playoffs
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg And Belichick I believe is undefeated head to head vs. Parcels including a playoff win
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg He did OK in Cleveland until the moved to Baltimore. That was a big distraction
@DGoodmantrublu @MeritNotParty @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg who was a bust now?
@DGoodmantrublu @PGar58 @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg #NYG let 3 coordinators Belichick, Lombardi &amp; Landry become legendary head coaches elsewhere
@PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG @kmcnyg I think they would've won by more than 1 point.
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG The Giants hired Handley instead of Belichick. Bad Move.
@stefiegirlNYG @PGar58 @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg I used to get psyched when he would truck defenders like this... 
@PGar58 @stefiegirlNYG @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg I will say this... Shockey got injured every year. Always missed some games.
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG I just think he was a young player at the time who was cocky &amp; rash.
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG His shouting match w/Reese. I was always a fan for what he did on the field.
@DGoodmantrublu @MeritNotParty @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG lol, that's fine I get it. But he was a baller. Can separate the 2, I didn't like...
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG I get why some Giants fans don't like him but he was a great player 4 us same as Tiki
@DGoodmantrublu @MeritNotParty @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG not being funny, but did you mean biased instead of unbiased?
@DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG Eli thru 4 over 3K yds &amp; 23 TDs. #NYG got hot b/c motivated by close loss to Pats not Shockey
@DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG Shockey was part of that. He's like Tiki. If he was in the lineup for SB fans prob feel different.
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG A lot of players (including Strahan) were frustrated when they ditched Kerry 4 a rook
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG He caught a TD in SB.  He was part of of the loaded offense &amp; had a nice game.
@DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG Shockey played 14 games in 2007.  Almost they entire season. Eli must've done OK w.him.
@MeritNotParty @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG Shockey didn't choke in Saints Super Bowl. Bavaro was great, no doubt.
@DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG If you like Bavaro better, I can't argue, but Shockey was WAY better than Boss. And I liked Boss #nyg
@DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg @stefiegirlNYG I love Eli, but he's thrown plenty of pics w/Shockey off team &amp; won lots of games w/Shockey that year
@kmcnyg @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG Shockey was a playmaker &amp; played w/passion. The way he left #NYG is what soured fans, not his play
@kmcnyg @DGoodmantrublu @stefiegirlNYG Shockey was great. Toomer has beef w/him. Said he was bad team mate, worse person. Strahan disagreed
@stefiegirlNYG @DGoodmantrublu @kmcnyg Shockey &amp; Bavaro were both awesome. Both stud TEs.  Both took defenders 4 rides #NYG Need another 1.

@DGoodmantrublu Wouldn't be opposed to that. He's younger too. Is he a FA? They def need to do something @ LB. Beason always hurt #nyg
@DGoodmantrublu He's not exactly LT... but Hawk's a professional linebacker.  #NYG needs that. gets decent amount of tackles every yr
The Packers cut AJ Hawk?  That's a FA that #NYG should SERIOUSLY consider bringing in, IMO. #giantschat

Adrian Peterson, never to play for the #Vikings again? Great.  He's destined 2B a Raider or a Cowboy now lol

@DeadlockVictim I didn't design the .jpg, so apparently someone did lol... tho I would've put Overkill instead myself.
I love Eddie Murphy, but I don't feel sorry for Cosby.  Still, the impression #SNL should've asked him to do is #Gumby.  #socialsquare
#IfThe80sNeverStopped Music would be A LOT better. 
@Still_sOUnerfan I think his prob was not that Pettitte was using, but that HE was using &amp; was vilified, but Pettitte used &amp; was adored.
Former #NYY 2B Chuck Knoblauch says baseball’s Steroids Era really wasn’t as bad as the narrative suggests.

@LarrySoprano @DGoodmantrublu Not asking for Bavaro or Shockey.  Just Boss or Ballard.
@DGoodmantrublu @LarrySoprano I was so excited about him, but then I felt teams started paying attention to him &amp; he became ineffective.
@DGoodmantrublu @LarrySoprano I think TE is a need too.  Not a top 3 round need, but not happy w/Donnel. Need competition there.
@DGoodmantrublu @LarrySoprano I know. I think part of decision was #nyg drafted Pugh yr B4 &amp; added Schwartz, Jerry &amp; Walton in FA.
@DGoodmantrublu @LarrySoprano I agree w/that. It's def a mix, but Beckham was to replace Nicks, who was drafted to replace Plax.
@LarrySoprano @DGoodmantrublu JR always says they draft BPA, but they have recently been drafting for need . #nyg
At 1st I thought #NFL should leave Marshawn alone. Thought he just wasn't comfortable in front of mic. After his antics I feel differently
Love Jim Rome's CBS Sports Minute knocking fans who hate on Seahawks &amp; Patriots. This coming from the snarkiest sports talk host of all time
@DGoodmantrublu I could see DE/LB in rd 2 though
@DGoodmantrublu If they go FA route, they will have to pay big money for a legit stud OT. Don't see them doing that. Draft much cheaper.
@DGoodmantrublu Think Coughlin needs to do what he did in Jax. Draft a Tony Bosseli type to build the O-Line around. Top priority IMO.
@DGoodmantrublu I just think thery went the FA route w/OL already (Schwartz, Walton).Didn't work.Think will draft one early. DE, LB needs 2
Seen a couple mock drafts w/ #NYG taking a DL or LB in RD 1.  I will be shocked if they don't draft stud OT in RD 1.  Most desperate need.

@IdaciosRealm @michaelshekar @RDanaFox @Giants360 But whatever, might've been awkward since he didn't get get DC pos w/us. Good hire by NYJ
@IdaciosRealm @michaelshekar @RDanaFox @Giants360 Yeah, considering our pass rush &amp; our LBs haven't exactly been stellar, he could've helped
@michaelshekar @RDanaFox @IdaciosRealm @Giants360 Right, I think Eli will get into the HOF even if he's won his last SB. 1 more = Slam Dunk.

Twitter mailbag: Salary-cap cuts, etc. 
@gmenhq @FanSided JPP's still young &amp; a lot of upside.  I'd tag him if they have to &amp; work out a cap friendly deal. W/out him D-Line = weak.
Bill Belichick is no #monalisavito lol #DeflateGate #classic #mycousinvinny 
Belichick on #ESNHD right now. #deflategate

Ax and Smash battle in the Royal Rumble: 1989 Royal Rumble 
@randyjcruz I don't even remember who won… but I remember that lol
@randyjcruz I think it was '89.  Andre was the 3rd wrestler.
@randyjcruz How about Ax vs. Smash as 1 &amp; 2?  That was cool
Crazy Drew Bledsoe really going to bat for Brady.  I thought he'd be more bitter about losing his job to him yrs ago
#Controversy every single week in the #NFL playoffs. No PI that burns Lions, Dez' no catch, now #deflategate. NFL loves the chatter.

NE is gonna end up firing a ball boy or something lol #deflategate
Tom Brady says he doesn't know how footballs became underinflated 
@TheChickenHorse That;s true lol.  I like have an extra game I can watch at 9:30.
@SiempreSosa I think they should get penalized somehow... just not a suspension during SB.
@SiempreSosa That's true too. The Rams are not happy about the SB loss to Pats.  Think it was shady due to spygate
@SiempreSosa I don't disagree, but they deserve that. Still, suspending them 4 SB will mean we won't have the best game. I don't like that
I don't think Belichick or Brady should get suspended 4 Super Bowl. Stop the madness. That will actually put an asterisk on a Seahawk win
All these PPL coming up w/theories &amp; excuses of how balls got deflated. Only excuse/explanation I wanna hear is from Brady #deflategate #nfl
3 #nfl London games in 2015 to kick off at 9:30 a.m. ET 
If Gronk gets caught w/Stickum in SB I will freak out lol #deflategate
b/c of cheating scandal NFL should just re-do the entire season to be fair.  This time, we have Spags tho #nyg

See what I mean?  I hate the fact that Odell Beckham Jr. is on Team Irvin! Only thing worse would be if Ray Lewis had a team #probowldraft
@DGoodmantrublu Maryland?  That's too bad.  South Jersey got hit, but Northern NY &amp; NYC are fine.
I thought we were getting snow today? #notcomplaining
@JoeandEvan I think #NFL considers Sean Payton infraction worse than Belichick b/c of NFL's sensitivity about concussions &amp; player safety
Why doesn't #NFL just supply the balls that will be used during the game?  It would make more sense. #deflategate
#fakebaby not in SAG! lol #americansniper
