@TamTamsWorld It will take longer than my patience allows

@TamTamsWorld I'd need more meds if I have to do all that
@TamTamsWorld Shouldn't the man in the relationship respect it first???
@glomwd It's really that simple
You have to train men now???? Do we get hazard pay for doing so???

I hate being tall :(.....
@yeswithak @Sicksteen_216 I'm 5'11", so it would feel really wired if I wore really high heels around a guy under 5'10
@glomwd lol

@daddykn0sbest I'm sure it's the other way around. He seems like a quiet guy &amp; they're the real freaks
@Petapup1 @stpete2you I'm sure he is
@Petapup1 @stpete2you No you're not
@stpete2you @Petapup1 Not looking forward to that either :(
@Petapup1 Yeah probably
@Petapup1 Good point. I know plenty of women who don't even want it anymore &amp; they seem happier
@Petapup1 if you start to not want it anymore then it's bad<PENSIVE FACE>
@Petapup1 You go numb after two yrs<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@daddykn0sbest I'm sure if I met a really good guy I can overcome that
@daddykn0sbest Nah it's not that necessarily, but I have a short attention span where men are concerned &amp; I may get bored
@daddykn0sbest A good guy wants a woman to be with him only though
@daddykn0sbest We sometimes have to suppress certain needs for the sake of the relationship. Might turn a good guy off
@daddykn0sbest The good guys always question a girl who knows how to do too much<WEARY FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
“@daddykn0sbest: U feed and fuck me...ima be faithful” Cool, then I'll have free time to do all the things I like
@daddykn0sbest I'm trying to eat healthy though<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@daddykn0sbest I have to know how he'll benefit me first
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld No you're not
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld If you're nicer to me I'll consider it
@daddykn0sbest Yeah. Lames ruin it all the time though
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld Thank you
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld I have my mood swings, &amp; I need you to understand that
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld I thought we were too, &amp; as friends if I tell you no once, then trying to convince me to do stuff becomes annoying
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld I never said yes either. I've just given up trying to get you to not ask me over &amp; over. Big difference
“@daddykn0sbest: Ladies do you draw in freaks or squares in the bedroom?” 5 minute freaks<UNAMUSED FACE>
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld Why do you even ask me???
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld WHY????
@Petapup1 I'm sure she's in shock that she's laying eggs
@WWWeaver @TamTamsWorld Her point is why are you always asking me for favors?????
@Petapup1 Mommy Tbird :)
@TamTamsWorld @WWWeaver I'm going to try not to be mean to him when I'm irritated. I'll be nice
@VinShu_ESQ You &amp; me both
@TamTamsWorld @WWWeaver I'm getting to the point where I don't even care anymore. He's not going to break me
@WWWeaver I hate being asked a lot of questions in general, but whatever
“@IkeMagnifico: 1.  If someone told you to wait 90 days before sex, would you?” Yes. I'd wait longer
@WWWeaver Nothing. You're just going to bug me all day until I say yes, even though I've told you that kind of thing is irritating
@WWWeaver SMH
@WWWeaver You're asking too much of me already<UNAMUSED FACE>
@WWWeaver What is it?
@WWWeaver Thank you
@WWWeaver SMH huh???
@WWWeaver Yeah whatever
I RT'ed the question, now leave me alone for the rest of the day unless you're actually nice to me@WWWeaver
@WWWeaver leave me alone. I'm sure someone else will RT it
@WWWeaver Stop asking me to do stuff
@WWWeaver it's an invasive question
