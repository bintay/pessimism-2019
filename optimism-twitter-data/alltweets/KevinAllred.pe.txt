I ordered <SLICE OF PIZZA><SLICE OF PIZZA><SLICE OF PIZZA> for dinner again. I think I have a problem. (or a solution???)
@spokenintellect I know. it's scary how many people find a way to ignore the facts. maybe this is the final straw it takes for folks to SEE!
@spokenintellect they mad cuz their fave #GeorgeZimmerman has been proved 7x over 2 b the WORST human while they still try to rep. ugh. SMDH
@KevinAllred I THINK IT'S MORE "MEAN" TO SHOOT AN UNARMED BLACK BOY!!
if you think jokes abt #GeorgeZimmerman getting shot (and not even being injured) are mean, SIT THE FUCK DOWN. he's alive/Trayvon is not
LOL at the followers I lose every time I tweet about race and racism.
@GeekNStereo ha! yeah, my 'pits are super cool. and when it gets hot in this bar, i just dab gin and tonic on them...
@GeekNStereo drinking gin and tonics cuz it's nice out! our strategies differ...haha
HEY GA POLICE-WHAT EXACTLY IS FOUL PLAY? CUZ U.S. HISTORY SAYS A BLACK MAN HANGING IN A TREE IS THE DEF. OF FOUL PLAY!!! #RooseveltChampion
what does it say about me as a writer that i am more productive writing at a bar than at a coffee shop??!?! :/ please send help.
a black man was lynched in GA today. &amp; not the police shooting kind of lynching. a real hanging from a tree lynching. THIS IS STILL AMERICA!
1820 is 1900 is 1952 is TODAY! U.S. police routinely execute unarmed black folks. Lynchings occur w/claim "no foul play" #RooseveltChampion
HOW?! LIKE...HOW?!??!?! 
hold on. brb. gonna get my drank and then live tweet the lyrics to you cuz they're priceless! #INeedAJanetJacksonComeback
hey everyone! remember that "whoops now, sorry i can't go" hidden track on #JanetJackson's janet. album. CUZ I'M LISTENING ON REPEAT!!!
i just wrote 6 pages, so i deserve 6 gin and tonics now right?! RIGHT?!
@jaimeshade ugh. touch√©. you right.
@jaimeshade you can be the 1st. the other 4 are golden girls now.
if the universe wants me to believe in Karma, the universe needs to have better aim when shooting #GeorgeZimmerman in the face...
how much violence does #GeorgeZimmerman have to be involved in before his defenders just say "fuck, we were wrong"??? like...i can't...
HER POWER! #PoliticizingBeyonc√©

fuck @Bravotv and fuck @andy for intentionally using @NeNeLeakes &amp; other black women's pain for ratings and sensational TV. #RHOAReunion

another powerful thing about this ep is showing the public just how ludicrous &amp; backwards following "military protocol" actually is #ScandaI
maybe I'm immature but every time they say "jag lawyer" I giggle. I know it's an acronym, but also so fitting <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #ScandaI

people showed up for class today i've never seen all semester. SPOILER ALERT: your grade won't be good.

@bardwellta i still bop to Feedback and LUV too!!! haha...
@TweetTrina4Lyfe i know right?! i looooove Janet, but i just pretend this one never happened. haha!
I used to think #JanetJackson's #Discipline was pretty crappy. I have changed my mind. It's amazing and better than most of today's music.
Damita Jo will always remain my least favorite #JanetJackson album due to the misstep of titling a song "Moist." NO MA'AM!
@jaybrannan my thoughts. always.
#JanetJackson is a better critical theorist than those dead white men i had to read in grad school: control, discipline, feedback. C'MON!
@tommytebow an MC Lyte come back would be so amazing!!
@tommytebow haha. i do my best. i'm really crossing my fingers on this one though!!!
@KevinAllred CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THIS? I NEED IT TO BE REAL!!!
WAIT WHAT?! JANELLE MON√ÅE &amp; MC LYTE ARE REPORTEDLY DATING - I AM DEAD!!!! 
@thobekileee @Beyonce they must have been living in a cave. i don't know how you can even claim that...

@EnnaSoCrowned Emeli is killer. as a singer and a writer. can't wait for new music from her! :)
@KvngSimbaaaaa true. def room for improvement. i guess she just gives me the overall feel of whitney more than anyone out there right now...
@EnnaSoCrowned what about Emeli Sand√© or VV Brown? i love both their voices too and they've got killer control...
@learnteachwin this app needs to stop. it is ruining my life. haha
@EnnaSoCrowned I mean...the quality and power of her voice is similar. haha.
@EnnaSoCrowned I'd add janelle monae to that list. she doesn't always blow but she def can.

compassion. kindness. tenderness. empathy. vulnerability. mercy.
but is anyone gonna use moco space on this ep tho? #Catfish
even 5 year old kids have phones these days. if she says she doesn't have a phone, this gotta be some ridiculous catfishing. #Catfish
@maxjoseph MAAAAAXXXX. thank god you're back. #CatfishMTV was a hot mess without you...
@YoungBossquiat as if they could by themselves. pop culture can't fix everything. &amp; who knows what other meetings they do have too
@YoungBossquiat exactly. socialism might be nice but it's not r reality. u can't ask artists to give up $ while others profit. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
labels don't own musicians-we don't own musicians-artists deserve to be compensated for work EVEN if they're already rich #TIDALforALL
@YoungBossquiat like...I can't with this backlash. shit is not free!!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

*checks for abs*

*orders pizza*
why's everyone so mad that artists wanna get paid for their work tho? #TIDALforALL
@tommytebow @CatfishMTV <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> FINALLY a #MaxIsBack
@tommytebow is max really back on Catfish tonight or is it an April fools day joke? cuz I've had enough of these rando co hosts!!
@ChrisDStedman is this Tuna's long lost uncle on his way to a business meeting or something?! ha! :) 
5 things that made me smile today: coffee, my dogs, temp. reaching 50 degrees, rolling up my jeans, &amp; smart, engaged students
just took me over 2 hours to travel 13 miles. THIS IS NEW YORK CITY!! #NYC #blessed
every time I drive through the holland tunnel water hits my windshield. which means THE HOLLAND TUNNEL IS LEAKING...
@C_GraceT don't tempt me!! :) I'm also in the mood for a road trip!
missing #Boston today...
@GeekNStereo thanks!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
new tattoo this weekend to remind me that it's not validation from institutions that matters - it's what you do!! :) 
@sliceofamberpie so happy you're interested in the book version!! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
also...my love and appreciation for paula cole IS NOT AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE!!!
no one will go with me to a paula cole concert next week. i'm both sad and embarrassed about this... :/
@tommytebow jealous!!!
I could use a brief dance party this morning to hype me up for my day...
@laifrncs LOOK AT YOU GO!!! <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
@laifrncs only heard the audio. I'll check out the video. not hating on it. just making an observation...<EYES> haha
real talk tho: i LOVE janelle mon√°e, but isn't this new song just "7/11" with less nonsensical lyrics??? &amp; the nonsense was the best part...
y'all...i still like Paula Cole. i can't help it. #sorrynotsorry and i still wanna know where all the cowboys have gone?!
@Keepin_up_wit_K they're gonna draw it out 3 more episodes before we really get so see her go in! haha
@BrandiGlanville is the only one that makes any sense on #RHOBH. she's consistent &amp; honest. that's more than can be said of the others <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
spoiler alert: Kyle Richards thinks the #RHOBHReunion is ALL ABOUT HER! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ChrisDStedman yessss! I'll be campaign manager!!
@KevinAllred also I like to pretend it was written for one of my dogs cuz her name is Honey <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
this song makes me so happy &amp; is the reason I have a tiger tattooed on my forearm: 
just gonna pretend it's spring and dress that way regardless of the weather. absolutely done with this gloomy cold.
i'm realizing it's a pretty wide range of music that defined who i am today...and #NinaSimone is at the forefront...
@chernowa g'night!
@chernowa it's a fun experiment. but i fear i'll get way too into it and forget to go to sleep - haha!
now i'm trying to see if i can make a playlist from my iTunes that tells my life story...this is getting deep...
the #AmosLee lyric "i never meant to be a burden / i just worry more than i'd like to" could probably sum up my life on my tombstone.
the harmonies between @amoslee &amp; @PattyGMusic on "Mountains of Sorrow" are the definition of perfect. they also make me tear up everytime...
i should go to bed but i'm falling into an iTunes k-hole...i could start tweeting about random music any moment now...
@ChrisDStedman @janetmock of course - it was my pleasure! i'd come see you speak ANYTIME! :)
tonight's the kinda night where I wish I could drive around listening to music with the windows down and no other cars on the road...
"I hope that everyone has some one that they'll break the law for. any law" - @emelisande
@janetmock MINE TOO!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

@chernowa yeah. don't bother. not memorable at all.
@queerfatty that moment was too funny. hahahaha.
@chernowa right? ugh...
@chernowa I believe it's called "bitch better have my money" :/ haha
@laughingat yeah. I mean it was ok. just didn't grab my attention like I wanted. I liked FourFiveSeconds more. :/

@TweetTrina4Lyfe just got off one of those. it was cut throat!!!
people's carry-on baggage was gotten way too big which creates a type of #HungerGames-esque battle for overhead compartment space. I'm done.
@tommytebow I know!! I'm bouncing all over the place the last couple weeks!! I'll get there one day!
just got bumped up to priority boarding and premium seating on this flight. don't know why. not gonna ask. VIP FOR A DAY!!!
I've been in #Atlanta for almost 3 hours and @NeNeLeakes hasn't texted me yet. so...I guess we're in a fight?? #RHOA

I just referred to 9 pm as "#ScandaI o'clock" in conversation.
thank you Shreveport and #CentenaryCollege. it was a pleasure!!!
call me crazy, but there's something kinda refreshing about an unapologetic #Catfish <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@tommytebow I was biting my tongue trying not to make an Ashanti joke! hahaha
YES! I love when the #Catfish gets belligerent and blames the person that calls the show.
@tommytebow I'm in!!!
I like how the #catfish is like "she needs to get over it cuz it is not healthy she's so obsessed with me" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I want an episode of #Catfish where it's someone's parent catfishing their kid as punishment for not cleaning their room or something!
if I were taking a shot every time they've said "ovoo" on this episode I'D BE DEAD! #Catfish
maybe the #Catfish made up ALL the profiles on mocospace cuz ain't no one know what the fuck that site is!!!
what even is this episode of #Catfish? ovoo? mocospace? they're just speaking gibberish. WHAT IS HAPPENING? am i having a stroke?
tonight was a much needed reminder for me. this is why I do what I do! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@tommytebow I got it!! I'm ready!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

what's going on with that guy Cyrus had to marry for the press tho...? #ScandaI or did he leave Cy over the bad hairpiece???

wait. they had a million guns the other episode on a public street and now no one has a gun to pull back on him in their own house? #Empire
I was like this is gonna be some "sexual healing" storyline and then it was a prayer. #Jesustakethewheel #Empire
that's kinda close just for a prayer, right? I mean I haven't been to church for a while but... #Empire
I love Jennifer Hudson but this is making me laugh. :/ #Empire
wait. did the bangs on that wig just grow longer???? raven, WHAT?!? #Empire
@ohrohin I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself. I think it's the bangs. :/
that kid is like "shut the fuck up and let me go to bed" #Empire
no shade but Olivia looking older than Cookie in these scenes. what is going on? #Empire
@_aminatah_ oh yeah - fresh prince "west Philadelphia born and raised". I buy it. I'm here for it.
THIS IS A SUZANNE VEGA SAMPLE Hakeem is rapping to. hahahaha. #Empire
BANGS!!! and a rolling suitcase. yasssss. #Empire
Cookie is TOO MUCH. every line she delivers is magic. #Empire
@_aminatah_ woah. I gotta think about that for a minute... <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
drinking game: take a shot every time Raven wears a new wig! #Empire
was that flashback the only screen time for mary j blige? cmon...that barely counts as a special guest credit #Empire
is white wife wearing white eye shadow?? I can't... #Empire
can we at least have a scene where Naomi Campbell throws a cell phone at someone too???? #Empire
@DalelaWatson me too. painful.
you know Lee Daniels wasn't about to let two black men be in a relationship together for too long tho #Empire
IS SHE HIS DAUGHTER THOUGH? where Maury and the paternity test? #Empire
overstepped? cookie's been making eyes at him for episodes now!! #Empire
@JenanMatari I love it. totally soap opera. and the writing is campy and terrible. but @TherealTaraji makes up for EVERYTHING!
@DalelaWatson it's all the people that tune in a little early for #empire and catch the last ten minutes. haha
#realtalk I still don't even remember the white wife's name either! :/ #Empire
does the white wife have a different face every week? I never recognize her. #Empire
is mary j playing herself via flashbacks? #Empire
@DalelaWatson was just thinking that same thing!!!
I'm ready for #Empire but I am not prepared for someone holding Cookie at gunpoint. y'all. #fixitjesus
yikes. no one wants to see Sarah McLachlan. and I don't blame them. $16? I paid that at a NYC parking meter :/ 
@bardwellta oh yeah. ok so she has at least 5 good songs. out of like 200? I guess it is hard to be Madonna. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ShaniceAlia it's better to pretend it's not happening.
@ShaniceAlia the rest were just so boring to me. and don't get me started on her new music. snooze. hahaa
tbh I only ever really liked "papa don't preach" and "like a prayer" - oh yeah and that song about "rain" #Madonna
American Horror Story: rich white women are oppressed
American Horror Story: Madonna
#Madonna &amp; KyleRichards should do a joint tour: "We're rich, we're white, we're women. It's all about us. But also its really hard to be us"

"I got treated better as a werewolf than I ever did as a black man!" - #UnbreakableKimmySchmidt <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@laurenduca I'll get one tomorrow in the daylight. and I'll use a cardboard cutout of carol kane on the stoop.
the exterior apartment in #UnbreakableKimmySchmidt is around the corner from mine. so just imagine me as integral character a block away!!
Julianne Moore just sent Shaquille O'Neal a happy bday tweet. I'm dead.
@KevinAllred also I haven't actually heard beck being played on the radio since the 90s. am I in a time warp???
beck is playing in this tattoo shop and it should be Beyonc√© tbh...
I get that #PieceByPiece is basically #BehindTheseHazelEyes pt 2, but it's just doing the most. sometimes subtle is more powerful. :/

@TWC_Help not good service.
@TWC_Help I can't with this right now. you all just need to make better service. and give concessions for those who your services don't work
@anilyn I'll have to rewatch another night. too much too real drama. wow. looks good though! :)
@tommytebow I'm like miss teen usa last night - I've been wronged and terrorized by my cable and nothing can ever make it right. :(
late unpopular opinion: I love parks and rec, but that finale episode was kinda trash. #sorrynotsorry
@TWC @TWC_Help your on demand service absolutely sucks. I pay over $100/month&amp;can't access shows. you should pay me $$ for this shit service
@tommytebow oh my god, my on demand will not load the show. my night is over.
#AmericanCrime is just not #HTGAWM and i couldn't make myself care. #sorrynotsorry #TGIT
@tommytebow thanks for commiserating with me. next time i'm in nashville (when will that be?!?!), let's both get tattoos... OF A CATFISH!
@ButItsMusuDoe #TBT - just in time
@tommytebow i didn't get my tattoo tonight so now i'm going in hard on CatFish. hahahaha...
@chernowa how amazing, right?! i'm already sure my life is a dream &amp; i'm not even awake ever since i've been on #SoPOPular w/ @janetmock! :)
@tommytebow ok. i'm totally working myself into it based on your high praise/surprise/whatever recommendation - haha!
@chernowa right?! it all felt doable back when i was young &amp; cute &amp; idealistic. now i'm like "can i just fail them if they are bigots?" :/
@tommytebow i'm getting ready. i'm preparing myself for the episodes i missed. whew. ok.
@chernowa hopefully we'll get there. just takes so damn long-guess that's why i wanted to be a teacher: to teach people to BE BETTER! :)
@chernowa that's great! but you're right - it's too bad society as a whole can't get it the fuck together and just be better overall. ugh.
@chernowa I bet! never spent much time in AZ but if Utah is any gauge, LA is much more welcoming and fun! :)
@tommytebow it's worth a shot. and I'm sure it won't hurt if I'm watching #catfish on demand. yasss
@chernowa that's where I was last week and it was too good. I didn't wanna leave.
@MarkTravRivera I'll check it out once I can breathe again after tonight's intensity. thanks for the rec!!!
@chernowa smart move! at this point in my life I think I'm done with winter in general. I need to relocate. haha.
@tommytebow me too. maybe if I drink some more whiskey it'll get better?!? :/
@chernowa night I wake up and I'm back there. haha
@chernowa ugh. snow. I was in Cali last week and praying every
@chernowa yeah I hear you. I'm a white kid from utah myself.
@MarkTravRivera @NBCBlacklist oh wow. been meaning to watch that one too. I'll have to give it some time soon. I need comedy now tho. :/
they should just broadcast an hour of silence after that #scandal episode. #AmericanCrime might be good but who  can emotionally deal now?:/
@chernowa I saw you being an hour different this week - it's a roller coaster ride for sure . you'll need that wine!!! wow!
@MarkTravRivera I'm so doing the same. I started it but it's just too much, especially after that Scandal ep. whew.
power of pop culture is that it can make us feel what we might not otherwise experience. hope all nonblack folks got schooled by #Scandal!!
@ButItsMusuDoe graduate and then teach it with me. rutgers doesn't pay much but we can split it!!! :)
@jmtaychi truth! and I am always here for Nina Simone anytime, anywhere. she is THE BEST.
@ButItsMusuDoe ok. next semester. let's make it happen. Nina is everything.
@ButItsMusuDoe I'm about to drop Beyonc√© for the rest semester and devote us all to the gospel of NINA. :) too good.
sometimes pop culture tries to make the most fucked up things in society better. it doesn't succeed. but it can help. thank you #Scandal !!
#NINASIMONE for the win in the final scene of #ScandaI. no one ever did it better than her. NO ONE. #Scandal
but how about an episode that shows the motherfucking racist cop convicted???? #Scandal
STOP THIS SCENE. #Scandal
wait. I am not here for this obnoxious Susan anti-vax to become a character in the show. #MellieForVP #Scandal
@KevinAllred and I never wanted to use his name again because he's not worth it but in the context of that scene it made sense.
we all know Darren Wilson has had that exact outburst in private, right? TELL THEM SHONDA. TELL THEM #SCANDAL
awww damn. thank you Quinn and Huck. #ScandaI
@ohrohin exactly. you nominate her. I'll second it. is that how these things work?
@HigherEdMike paging @shondarhimes WE HAVE A MILLION $$ IDEA HERE!!
also - like a knife 25 feet away is excuse for multiple bullets fired at a black boy. this is too much. #Scandal
#JESUSTAKETHEWHEEL #SCANDAL stop the cryptic shit and take a political stand!!!!!!
@HigherEdMike oh yeah. we were gonna do the crossover episode. nevermind. mellie's out. Selina's back in. :)
@HigherEdMike haha. spoiler alert. haven't watched house of cards. but I'm team Mellie for VP!!!!
do NOT write off Liv standing with the activists as part of her post traumatic stress. DONT DO IT SHONDA. PLEASE. #ScandaI
wait. is it legal to just made the Vice President Mellie? conflict of interest or nah? cmon... #Scandal
ok. thank you. I was not about to watch this full hour if Liv continued to validate the system. #Scandal
omg OLIVIA. he is sitting over his dead sons body and you think he wants a sandwich?!?!? I CANT... #Scandal
AND they're going in on vaccinations. #scandal is doing the damn thing tonight. holy Jesus.
@HillaryCrosley same. I'm watching between fingers covering my face. I'm scared she won't.
@HillaryCrosley like...there's a way to do this storyline and this is just not it. at least so far. :/
that white cop even looks like Mike Brown's murderer. wow. #Scandal
Marvin Gaye. saxophone solo. pan to Kerry Washington looking pensive. #Scandal
I can't wait to see what happens on #HTGAWM tonight!! oh wait...fuck...<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #TGIT
Liv walks up to all them with a smile like nothing is going on at all. I can't... #Scandal
also when I said "racist police brutality" I quickly realized that was redundant. #Scandal
did he cut bangs into that hair piece? #Cyrus #Scandal
either I forgot over the past two weeks or Cyrus's hair piece for EVEN WORSE!! #Scandal
Liv takes on racist police brutality. I bet she fixes it within the hour too. MAGIC. #Scandal
omg. the tattoo place is too busy so I get to tweet #scandal with everyone! #TGIT
@tommytebow I'm too impulsive. afterwards I'll watch the old catfish. haha
@tommytebow YESSSSS! i might just go get one tonight but then i miss scandal. so i'm debating.
@tommytebow i get new ones all too often. my bank account hates me for it. but i love it. haha
to paraphrase Shakespeare, "to live tweet #Scandal or to go get a rose tattoo on my leg? that is the question."
I think "snow day" is actually pronounced "spontaneous tattoo day"
@nick_ramsey @dorseyshaw @janetmock aaahhh! NO! make it stop. :/
@tommytebow oh damn. I got really excited for a second. haha
@tommytebow wait. when? is there a date for Rihanna yet?
why am i listening to #WhitneyHouston's cover of "You Light Up My Life" on repeat? #WhitneyTakeTheWheel
My most recommended, shared, gifted book is #ParableOfTheSower by #OctaviaButler (or anything by her really!) Read it! #WorldBookDay
For #WorldBookDay, what is the one book you recommend to friends most? Like, the one you can't live without???
It's #WorldBookDay - go out and buy a new book today (if you can afford it). take it up a notch and buy/share a book with a friend!!!
i will never stop being surprised @ how unprepared the east coast is for any/every amount of snow like it never happens. snow day shout out!
i've gotta watch #BeyondTheLights this weekend - missed it in theaters and have been waaaaiiiiittttttiiinnnngggg... :)
@TherealTaraji favorite line of the whole episode!!!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
like is Nev qualified to have stalker interventions on TV? shouldn't like actual therapists or law enforcement be involved? #Catfish
@tommytebow she's turned it up to 11. her life has been literally terrorized and ruined and not even #Catfish can save her.
are these last ten minutes gonna be all about miss teen usa? I'm done. #Catfish
omg. Nev should take him up on the massage. #Catfish
@tommytebow his baggy pants could clothe an entire nation!!!
I did not intend to watch this whole episode of #Catfish cuz I have things to do but I gotta see this guy now...
@tommytebow THAT IS STILL MT FAVE!!
this miss teen USA has GOT to dial it down a notch. I can't. #Catfish
@tommytebow I can't not laugh. I know I shouldn't. but it's too over the top.
"THIS IS REAL LIFE. THATS WHY WE'RE HERE" #Catfish
@tommytebow this all went from 0 to 60 in no time at all - and then it just drove straight over a cliff. HAHAHA
why did they just bleep out Nev saying ".org" when he said the whole rest of the website??? hahaha #Catfish
63% of ever #Catfish episode is people saying "I just think it's really weird"
@KevinAllred so you were hoping he was the opposite of an asexual foot fetishist who masturbates a lot? #Catfish I can't...
"this is exactly what we were hoping the case wouldn't be"- #Catfish <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@tommytebow OK IT JUST GOT GOOD. hahahahaha.
@tommytebow ok. I'll have to catch up over the weekend
@tommytebow ok. I guesssss I can allow it...
also am I have a stroke or do those pictures that they say are totally different actually kinda look like the same person? #Catfish
#Catfish without Max just doesn't work for me. :/
Jennifer Hudson is gonna EGOT!! she's for the Oscar and Grammy. now she's on TV and opening on Broadway in Color Purple. GET IT!! #Empire
wait. Jennifer Hudson is a musical therapist?!? Mary J Blige??? WHATTTT?!? #Empire
@learnteachwin don't ask... haha
SOMEONE SING LEAN ON ME AGAIN STAT! #Empire
this "you're so beautiful" is now the gayest straightest song EVER! #Empire
this club just turned into a cruise ship. where's the shuffleboard? #Empire
wasn't Cookie the drunkest about half an hour ago? she's got amazing recovery!! #Empire
if me and my 2 sisters were stuck on an elevator for more than like 15 minutes, we probably wouldn't all make it out. :/ #Empire
does everyone know Dre is bipolar or is it a family secret? I'm confused. #Empire
y'all are on a public street. you cannot draw 15 guns on each other. #Empire
these dummies broke the elevator and Dre is gonna full on lose his shit. #JesusTakeTheWheel #Empire
I'm dead. drunk Cookie. #Empire
@iamnickgaines loooooove her!!
I like deciding which record label to go with based on how much they can drink. yes Cookie! #Empire
I love all the cameos on #Empire - next can VV Brown please be on the show?? that would be EVERYTHING!
@tommytebow awww. I'll find him in NYC and just follow him around. haha
@iamnickgaines haha. yes you can!
@tommytebow oh I gotta catch up!!!!! I love catfish. haha
I hope Jamal puts out that weird sexy single and it tanks just so Cookie can call him "fake ass D'angelo" !!!! #Empire
@tommytebow wait. Catfish is on again? I'm way behind... :/
remember when Terrance Howard had that ALS spasm thing and couldn't speak out loud? I liked that. let's go back to that. #Empire
I do want a full album from V Bozeman in real life tho. like tomorrow? #Empire
@HillaryCrosley it's such a weird sexy mashup. haha
I want Porsha to be the breakout star of these last few episodes. PLEASE!!! #Empire
wait. Jamal. this song. no. #Empire
"PORSHA - PHONE CHECK!" hahahaha #Empire
@HillaryCrosley I'm dead already
holy shit. this opening. @TherealTaraji needs an Emmy now. give one to Porsha too. just cuz. #Empire
I love Cookie calling everyone "fake ass fill in the blank" YASSSS #Empire
‚Äú@HuffingtonPost: Former Oasis singer totally trashes Taylor Swift 
I turned on the tv too early before #Empire and American Idol is on and I'm like..."why?" and also "eww...stop screaming."
"you can dance in a hurricane - but only if you're standing in the eye..."
if you're not into Bettye LaVette you're not LIVING!!!
"4 every step I take ur right there tryin to block my next move / &amp; if ur makin me feel bad, tell me then do you feel good?" #WhitneyHouston
"tell me no / and I'll show you I can" - #WhitneyHouston
@jadetdot YES! I especially love "tell me no"!!
Just Whitney is an under appreciated #WhitneyHouston treasure! has anyone written an essay on how it is a major fuck you to Clive Davis yet?
@laurenduca I think that's about it tho. haha. <EYES>
here's the best thing I have to say about the new Kelly Clarkson album so far: I like when Kelly Clarkson uses swear words.
@janetmock @HillaryCrosley LOVE the Jezebel video! YASSS!! :)
@TherealTaraji's Cookie shouting out "GO MAL" with so much love and support and cheering her ass off was EVERYTHING. #EmpireFOX
Jamal just came out in song and now I'm crying again. good thing I locked my office door. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #EmpireFOX @JussieSmollett
these outfits at the white party tho...#Empire
@C_GraceT haha. I'm feeling good about my decision!!
i will now watch #EmpireFOX during my office hours cuz students never come to see me anyway...
oh, that thing you want me to do? i won't be doing it. you're welcome...
@Reignof_Styles thanks! it was therapeutic at least. :)
just broke down in tears to Whitney Houston songs while driving to work. so that's how my days going so far. how bout you???
@laifrncs you too!!! <DANCER><DANCER><DANCER>
the hardest lesson to learn is still that I must be so confident in what I do that it doesn't matter whether they like me or not...
I AM NOT A MORNING PERSON
hey remember how GOOD @tonibraxton's debut album was?!?!
like...i'm really bored. i'm just gonna go listen to "Since You Been Gone" instead...
ive loved some kelly clarkson songs in the past but can someone tell me the good ones from #PieceByPiece? i'm finding myself uninterested :/
@_aminatah_ nice!
north east, I really can't right now. stop. seriously.
@_aminatah_ Oscar wao is a great book too!! :)
@_aminatah_ awwwww. :)
@_aminatah_ that book is INTENSE!!
@bardwellta sooooooo good!!!!
i can't count the number of times music has saved my life. literally.
look people in the eye and smile. even a smile can keep someone's heart from breaking...
@kaylurt no class today cuz of weather - in case you didn't get the email! will be back in full force on wednesday! :)
Honored to be part of new episode of @TwoBrwnGirls w/@zblay &amp; @fariharoisin talking pop news &amp; #politicizingbeyonce: 
I joined the amazing Two Brown Girls podcast this week to discuss Empire, Zendaya, How To Get Away With Murder... 
@lexxiicoop it might be a while... :/ but I'm trying to get things moving as fast as I can!!

I'M ON AN AIRPLANE &amp; CAN'T WATCH #HTGAWMFinale THIS IS THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE #HTGAWM
New piece that's been rolling around in my head for a little bit: "Dear White People" 
is @KidRock implying that he does, in fact, have a "purple rain" cuz i can't name 1 of his songs except that weird duet with sheryl crow :/
@laurenduca <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>

Claremont McKenna College is treating me like a rockstar and I'm not worthy! (but i love it!) thanks @dayyyum_shan for bringing me here! :)
does anyone want to hire me in southern California? i don't want to leave. #PoliticizingBeyonce
@janetmock thanks! they are already giving me rock start treatment and i'm eating it up. haha! enjoy the SUN and WARMTH :)
@janetmock i know - i'm doing the claremont mckenna thing tonight so a little outside LA, but close!! we're travel twins!
@janetmock ME TOO! i'm outside in the sun in LA before my talk tonight. i don't think i wanna go back on thursday. :/
OH MY GOD I HAVE MISSED CALIFORNIA #TravelTuesday
@USAirways nice customer service. that does nothing for upset passengers.
@USAirways it's flight 660 and we're currently 2.5 hours past take off. still sitting. no offer of anything to compensate us for this waste
@USAirways you should offer something to your passengers other than no explanation if you want repeat business. poor form.
@USAirways I don't think that's true since no one had prepared the plane for takeoff and the pilot even doesn't know why we can't leave. :/
my @USAirways flight can't take off cuz the lavatory tanks are full. so I'll miss a connection because they can't get it the fuck together!
SHOUT OUT TO THE WHITE BOY LOUDLY RAPPING WHILE ON THE PHONE  &amp; USING THE URINAL AT NEWARK AIRPORT &amp; NOT WASHING HIS HANDS!! #TravelTuesday
I can't with today anymore. I just need to watch ##PumpRules &amp; make fun of the terrible people on it from the privacy of my couch
I think #JanetJackson has more interesting things to say about #control than #Foucault does TBH
@jmtaychi hopefully i'll be coming your way soon with an event too! :)
@jmtaychi thanks for sharing! :)
#PoliticizingBeyonce CHICAGO! 
I'm coming to Southern California for this event - 2/25 (this Wednesday) @ Claremont McKenna College. 
@bunnibutts true. i feel the dragging too &amp; have been participating. just trying to find something more affirming at the same time :)
what if, instead of wasting negative energy over @PattyArquette today, we all just did something good for the world to counter her fuckery?
@KiaHutch so true!! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
just seeing the REST is what Patricia Arquette said after I turned off the snooze fest #Oscars2015. gross. do better Patricia
@andreashypailo @Dianka_Manana awww, thanks!!!! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è<WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è<WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@Dianka_Manana ill be back to live tweet another day! haha. but this show is too much of a snooze :/
@chernowa yikes!!
@chernowa yeah, i hear you. there's better ways to spend my time before monday comes. this thing is gonna go for another 2 hours i bet :/
@laurenduca all you soldiering through - you're the real MVP! haha
y'all. I'm not gonna make it through. I'm gonna go read a book or something. I feel like #Oscars2015 are making me dumber. :/ good luck...
Patricia Arquette's speech and this Rita Ora performance are the best things so far. #Oscars2015
yesssss. Meryl was feeling that speech!! #Oscars2015
this category really makes me wanna go watch old episodes of Medium. #Oscars2015
DESPERATE. #Oscars2015

<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@violadavis should win an #Oscar for that Intro speech to this montage that nobody cares about!!!!! #Oscars2015
YASSSSS. they just played @violadavis out to #WhitneyHouston. YASSSSS. #Oscars2015
wait. are these two from #DowntonAbbey ??? #Oscars2015
like no one listens to the play off music. they just talk as long as they want. what's the point? #Oscars2015
EVERYTHING IS NOT AWESOME #Oscars2015
@tylercoates I already had 2 and a half...
is this the Nickelodeon awards all of a sudden? but tegan and Sara's harmonies are kinda pretty. :/ #Oscars2015
@Dianka_Manana haha. tipsy is the only way to make it through this!!! :)
HOLY SPARKLY PANTSUIT. yes shirley maclaine #Oscars2015
"movies aren't about countries" - except sometimes they are. like #SelmaMovie was definitely about race and america. hmm. #Oscars2015
I'm already so bored of #Oscars2015 which might be quicker than I got bored of #Grammys2015. hard to tell...
@Dianka_Manana if I had won I should say. not like I'm up for any awards tonight. haha
@chernowa I know. sheesh.
@Dianka_Manana if I win, I would twirl in a full circle then just walk straight back to my seat.
@chernowa like...ugh. all these rich white people. :/
@chernowa I just got real angry at that joke. grrrrrrr. :/
what are we supposed to think $160k worth of free shit? that could pay off my debt &amp; salary for 2 years at least so....fuck you. #Oscar2015
@Dianka_Manana me too. maybe my favorite original song performance from all the #Oscars I can remember
remember that year Elliot Smith sang at the Oscars? damn. that was pretty cool. #Oscars2015
it's only been 30 seconds and already too much falsetto. #Oscars2015
from law and order: SVU to the oscars! next up - I smell on Oscar for ICE T #Oscars2015
I don't get what Foxcatcher is about. does someone kill a wrestler? #Oscars2015
@SmartAssJen @janetmock you won't be the only one!!! :)
Lupita is giving JOSEPHINE BAKER in that dress. #Oscars2015
you can't just add people of color to the dance montage to make #Oscars2015 more diverse. #OscarsSoWhite
CAN BEYONCE JUST HOST THE OSCARS THO? #Oscars2015
yes. NPH went right in on #OscarsSoWhite haha #Oscars2015
is Jennifer Hudson singing tonight at #Oscars2015? BUT WHY NOT #LEDISI????? (I actually love Ledisi but you see what I did there...)
@laurenduca I love it. it deserves a whole season on bravo.
oh shit. here we go. #Oscars2015
@laurenduca is she trying challenge madonna's Grammy look? that would be a battle
everyone's trying to pry #Scandal details from @kerrywashington on the red carpet. SHE CANT TELL. duh. #Oscars2015
I'm also not here for that Gaga mess #Oscars2015
Tim McGraw singing Glen Campbell song tonight. I used to work @ a theatre where Glen played &amp; he left his teeth at the last venue. :/ oops
unpopular opinion I guess: I don't love what #JLo is wearing. #Oscars2015
@andreashypailo how do you choose???!?!?
ok. 3 way tie now for #BestDressed: Lupita, Cate, Solange #Oscars2015 #LupitaNyongo #CateBlanchett #Solange
which sucks cuz I like Nicole Kidman. :/ #Oscars2015
Nicole Kidman's purse looks like the container store. and she kinda looks like the joker from batman. :( #Oscars2015
Gwyneth - no. just no. pastel pink = bad bridesmaid. and that giant rose on your shoulder is the weirdest... #Oscars2015
@jadetdot you're better off for it!! he played Sherlock Holmes a while ago and everyone got obsessed.
@andreashypailo maybe it's like a third times the charm thing? haha
@LaraMHenry right?!
@LyraComm yesssssss. you're so right!!
@jadetdot haha. boring British actor that everyone seems to gag over. he creeps me out though...
she always looks good and does pretty great in her roles. she's just basic tho. :/ #ReeseWitherspoon #Oscars2015
didn't Julia Roberts wear the dress Reese Witherspoon has on like 10 years ago?? #Oscars2015
I know everyone is all about it but I just can't with Benedict Cumberbatch. I don't get it. #Oscars2015
@LyraComm agreed. she's just so classic and always perfect.
I need #guilianarancic to shut up because black dresses can be EVERYTHING. case in point: CATE BLANCHETT #Oscars2015
@nskbelanger oh yeah, I agree! forgot about her. she looked amazing too!
I also love her because she does not give two fucks about Hollywood and is actually a real person!!! #CateBlanchett #Oscars2015
can I just tweet about Cate Blanchett for the next 37 mins? I love her too much. she's been my #1 girl crush since high school. #Oscars2015
Lupita and Cate Blanchett tied for #BestDressed for me tonight so far!!! #Oscars2015
CATE BLANCHETT AND A STATEMENT TURQUOISE NECKLACE. I'm dead. loudest gasp of the night. #Oscars2015
did #RyanSeacrest just say "12 years OF slave"?!?!? I can't... #Oscars2015
@laifrncs just use him as your arch nemesis to fuel you toward greatness! :)
@jadetdot I've been drinking whiskey so I'm a little snark-heavy tonight. haha.
Olivia Pope just Kanye shrugged and walked the fuck away from #RyanSeacrest. yasssss!!! @kerrywashington #Oscars2015
@chernowa @cmcasarez nice!! first time I tried to see it, it was sold out which was awesome for the movie. but :( for me. haha
@jadetdot at least it's only 1. so far. but they really just need to go home.
also. why are any Kardashians at #Oscars2015. go home please.
wait. is #KhloeKardashiansSoWhite a hashtag?
@chernowa everything else seemed so boring to me. :/ I'll have to catch some of them on video I guess. or not. haha
I've actually seen exactly 0 of the big films nominated tonight but that won't stop me from tweeting the shit out of #Oscars2015
@learnteachwin yesssss
I just gasped. LUPITA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #Oscars2015
man. at this rate I'm gonna be way drunk before #Oscars2015 actually start.
@andreashypailo wow. I couldn't believe it. :/
#RyanSeacrest interviewed #DavidOyelowo as if #SelmaMovie  was fiction. I wanna punch him in the face so bad. #Oscars2015 #OscarsSoWhite
that maroon tuxedo tho is EVERYTHING. #DavidOyelowo #Oscars2015
Ryan fucking Seacrest - the "character" is MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.  it's real life you idiot. #Oscars2015
I love Laura Dern. and she looks beautiful tonight. that's all. #Oscars2015
#RyanSeacrest is the awkward uncle no one wants to talk to at family reunions. and he's the worst interviewer of all time. #Oscars2015
Ethan Hawke's face looks like it should be on Mt. Rushmore. take that to mean what you will. #Oscars2015
#noshade but Anna Kendricks dress kinda looks like Blanche from the golden girls :/ #Oscars2015
@C_GraceT I wouldn't even recognize her in a supermarket tbh... but I do like that song "would you cry just a little..." haha
did they just say there's going to be a sound of music tribute featuring lady Gaga?? please no... <DIZZY FACE>
someone in the room with me just said: "faith hill kinda looks like a fancy white supremacist!" hahaha #Oscars2015
I mean they're surprised they haven't seen faith hill on red carpet since last year. BUT WHY WOULD WE SEE FAITH HILL ON THE RED CARPET?
WHY ISNT EVERYONE MAD THAT NO ONE ASKED #LEDISI TO SING AT THE OSCARS TONIGHT? hmmm. hypocritical... #Oscars2015
@tommytebow blah :/
@alex_abads did they write it or they're just bringing some gay sass???
@EnnaSoCrowned WHAT ABOUT LEDISI??? Haha. jk. too soon?
I'm so confused. tegan and sara are on the red carpet at #Oscars2015.
@EnnaSoCrowned damn
wait. is #Beyonce singing at #Oscars2015?? I need a reason to sit through til the end!!!!
@learnteachwin me too. and then the flask to keep the party going. haha
@learnteachwin oh my god - I KNOW. i wouldn't be able to take it. it's like a full 8 hours with all the nonsense
why has the red carpet started on E!? who is even arriving to #Oscars2015 this early?! can they even drink at these awards?!
@laifrncs that's when the wine comes in handy. :)
@laifrncs i'll take one for the team and let you know everything you need to know. haha
@laifrncs i don't actually care about any of the movies this year, so i should skip...but i love any chance to snarkily live-tweet! :)
i should probably start drinking now in order to make sense of the oscars tonight. i mean...right?! #Oscars2015 #OscarsSoWhite
2/25 - Claremont McKenna College - 5:30 pm #PoliticizingBeyonce 
2/25 - Claremont McKenna College - 5:30 pm 
@lajuantonsoup awwww. love this. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@unfoRETTAble singing on #ParksandRec is like heaven on earth!!!!
OMG I JUST REALIZED I WILL BE ON A PLANE DURING THE ENTIRE #HTGAWM FINALE NEXT WEEK. I THINK IM GONNA HAVE A STROKE! :(
you are your own worst enemy. you are also exactly who you've been waiting for. (to paraphrase both #JuneJordan &amp; #AliceWalker)
wow! @DaRealAmberRose is certainly winning the clap <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> back <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> game <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>for <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> all <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> time!!!
sometimes i write stuff: 
New writing about some things that happened today and stuff and the full thing is up on my website at the link... 
@episodeguides AGREE!! haha
yessss. viola's just like Beyonce in the elevator video - she knows everyone is watching #HTGAWM
awwww, drunk Oliver. #HTGAWM
I don't know how many times I can say HOLY SHIT during this episode. Ms. Tyson BURNED THAT HOUSE DOWN!! #HTGAWM
"boo hoo. Rebecca lied to me. I never saw this coming." - dumb Wes. #HTGAWM
does Oliver get paid for any of this? #HTGAWM
holy shit! it's all coming out now! wow. this is the bravest, most vulnerable  scene on TV in a minute. #HTGAWM
SPOILER ALERT: REBECCA IS STILL THE MURDERER #HTGAWM
obviously Rebecca is dealing bad drugs. Rudy took them and she set him up. Lila took some and it killed her. #HTGAWM
why does anyone trust Rebecca? it's unfathomable. #HTGAWM
@chescaleigh the train is off its tracks for sure. at least in the courtroom. I love the home scenes with Viola and Cicely.
@Keepin_up_wit_K this whole case is all kinds of wrong. they should refocus on getting away with murder and forget this...
BONNIE YOU ARE NOT ANNALISE. put her vodka away, girl. #HTGAWM
I can't. HUMPR. hahahaha. #HTGAWM
hahahaha. sex ed from Cicely Tyson. YESSSS. #HTGAWM
can we move past these tired "no one believes we had sex because I'm so ugly look at me" storylines? ugh. are we that basic? #HTGAWM
@HigherEdMike @violadavis @RestingPlatypus ok, he can come too. :)
we can just move everyone else onto spin offs - The Bonnie Trials. The Rebecca Murders, etc. #HTGAWM
@googleme_Shawni YES. it will happen.
I can't. these scenes are too good. get rid of the rest of the show. @violadavis and Cicely Tyson are ALL WE NEED!!! #HTGAWM
HER NAME IS ANNA MAE!!!! #HTGAWM
did Bonnie intentionally look stupid to prove that she's smart? ugh. I'm not here for it. #HTGAWM
@laurenduca it is so LOFT. so Ann Taylor. hahaha
@C4mYouNot worst. decision. EVER!
trial hasn't even started and Bonnie the epic defense attorney just called her client guilty. #FireBonnie #HTGAWM
oh my god. Bonnie. you're fired. gaaawwwwwddddd! #HTGAWM
wait. do we have to watch Bonnie try a whole case? snooze. get back to the action please. #HTGAWM
mama keating just went IN and then straight for a hug. this is brilliant and I already have tears in my eyes. #HTGAWM
"you're boss came outta my v" is the best line I've ever heard on television!!!!!!! CICELY TYSON!!! #HTGAWM
I love Nate tho...can't Rebecca just go to jail instead? #HTGAWM
strip search. #HTGAWM
@googleme_Shawni <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
"you didn't save me. I'm on my own." TELL HIM LIV! #ScandaI
Fitz is being so Kyle Richards right now. ITS NOT ABOUT YOU FITZ. #Scandal #RHOBH
"What's a Gladiator?" 
"It means the same thing as bae. Shut up, Cyrus." #Scan‚Ä¶
omg. what if they all leave and she gets kidnapped again. REMIX. #Scandal
maybe I've had too much red wine since season 1, but I don't really remember this dude. #Scandal
hahaha. Cyrus doesn't even know what a gladiator is. #ScandaI
is this whole storyline a gigantic fuck you to Claire Daines for winning awards over Kerry Washington? #Homeland #ScandaI
yes. REVENGE IN HIGH HEEL BOOTS WITH GUNS! #ScandaI
if this episode ends with another teaser about who is buying Olivia, I will consider this a wasted hour. #ScandaI
oh my god. someone just call Liam Neeson and get Liv back. he returns taken people ad nauseum. #ScandaI
wait. why is Rowan living in a cabin the woods now? #ScandaI
Portia di Rossi 's face every time she looks at Huck is too good. #ScandaI
yessss. Huck is going full Dexter on the VP. EVERYTHING. #ScandaI
can Abby just get her old job back tho? that makes more sense... #ScandaI
Liv is the smartest motherfucker around til it comes to strategy to get herself free. then she fails. back &amp; forth. back &amp; forth. #ScandaI
@TopCollab true. they gotta keep red written into this storyline somehow! haha
just reread my Abby tweet. Repping corrected to rapping. I WISH ABBY WAS RAPPING FOR LIV instead. haha. #ScandaI
How is Olivia so dumb not to play reverse psychology on that? it was clear in everyone's eyes. #ScandaI
a tie?!?!? can't you give like 1 more dollar to break the tie? #ScandaI
Liv is like..."what? mama?" #ScandaI
@googleme_Shawni that's when it's the most fun!
when did Abby start rapping so hard for Liv?. she hated her like 5 episodes ago. #Scandal
@Reignof_Styles ok. I'm RSVPing for April cuz I'm coming through New Orleans then. haha :)
@laurenduca @chescaleigh complicated jake seems a lot like uncomplicated jake. :/
@chescaleigh cuz this kidnap story was cool for 1 episode. now it's just tired. ugh. where's Viola and Cicely?
can we just give Huck a freebie for this one? Quinn ruins everything... #Scandal
@chernowa kinda wish it was real though.
@Reignof_Styles I wanna come to your party next Thursday!!! haha
leave huck alone. without his beast, y'all would be screwed. #Scandal
Mellie can code switch like a muthafucka! #Scandal
Noooooooooooo!!! I need that scene to be reality. dumb Cyrus. #Scandal
Cyrus about to explode. that hair piece gonna come flying off. #Scandal
I mean...the CIA lady has a lot of points. :/ #Scandal
all america's dirty secrets are gonna come out just to save Liv. happy Valentine's Day. #Scandal
also, why did they have to turn Andrew nasty?! Mellie deserved a break. he waited like a million years for her. ugh #Scandal
no way. they gotta punish the VP somehow. fuck amnesty. #Scandal
@Reignof_Styles mine barely had time to breath before I gulp. do I have a problem?!? haha
maybe we could start a campaign: "Drinking Red Wine To Bring Olivia Home!" and by campaign, i basically mean happy hour. #TGIT #Scandal
@bunnibutts oh oh oh oh! that was good! :)
Olivia hasn't had her red wine lately since she's been all kidnapped and shit, so i'm gonna drink a lot of red wine for her. #TGIT #Scandal
#IglooAustralia quit Twitter because folks were too mean to her. she knows all she ever had to do was acknowledge her privilege tho, right?
i'm adapting #Cookie's "boo boo kitty" from #Empire. i will now refer to @taylorswift13 only as "boo boo swifty."
@laurenduca YES! drinks anytime. i'm super down with that. it was so fun talking today!!
@laurenduca @Beyonce all Critical Theory should be about Beyonc√© tbh...
@thobekileee @lexxiicoop i saw this. haha. i can't even...these fans are hardcore!!!
the #PoliticizingBeyonce dictionary could also just be considered me jumbling words together as they travel from my head to my mouth, so...
constructure: simultaneous focus on structures of power &amp; the actions that keep them in place. from the #PoliticizingBeyonce dictionary
we all slip up sometimes. we can all do better the next time.
@sexayyynikkkayy I didn't handle the whole thing in the best way. so I'm sorry too.  :)
@sexayyynikkkayy no worries!! it's all about learning. :) I know you weren't speaking from a mean or offensive place.
teacher fail today. caught off guard when a student used an offensive term. couldn't navigate a teaching moment. floundered. sorry, class!
if Kanye and boo boo swifty go through with this terrible plan to collaborate, I will lose at least 43% respect for him. I AN NOT KIDDING!
@bardwellta that's what I thought. thank you for confirming!
CHICAGO: I am coming to see you for a community classroom event on 3/18!! #PoliticizingBeyonce
I have no desire to watch #LookingHBO. what does that say about me? :/
@VanessaAviva YESSSS! congrats. that's the best feeling.
@ShLueck yes! I've listened. it's pretty good!
@Phillyhilll these are great choices. I'll put them on my list for tweeting!!! yay!! :)
@Phillyhilll I will look it up! haven't heard her before.
do y'all even know how spectacular @DawnRichard's music is tho? go listen in order now: #ArmorOn-#Goldenheart-#Blackheart. I'll wait...
@laifrncs rutgers Newark is not ready for this wig!!!
@laifrncs oh...i bet you're right. sia wig... HERE I COME!
@laifrncs also, why can't i spell? i've been having a homonym issue lately. i need to WEAR the wig. not where a wig. haha. ugh.
@robBEbailey yesssss. do it. that look is a winner.
@laifrncs good choices. i can only do the sia album if i can find a sia wig to where at the same time tho...i'll get on the case...
@robBEbailey i should do this one tomorrow for throwback thursday! i was just listening to some donna summer the other day too!
i'm taking requests for albums you want me to listen to and live tweet. this is gonna be fun. i'll probably drink alcohol whilst tweeting...
got home too late to watch and tweet #EmpireFOX #Empire :(
@ShLueck @Beyonce @Lavernecox haha! YASSS!!!
@googleme_Shawni me too. i'll see if i can find anything online - the designer appears to be a white guy but can't find much more. :/
@googleme_Shawni and also, i kinda just don't like the coat regardless of what the image is about. haha
@googleme_Shawni hmmm. me either. they do look similar but i'm curious what the designer says about the image he painted...
@googleme_Shawni aaaaahhhhhh
i don't care how long you knock on my office door. it's closed. i'm listening to music and playing trivia games. go away. please &amp; thank u.
ewww @PETA-just stop w/ yr disgusting analogies. i'm vegetarian but want to eat a hamburger now just to piss you off: 
@helenchristine thank you!! I will have to crack open a beer and tweet my way through this soon!! haha
@helenchristine no. what is that and where do i find it?! haha...
(skipping ahead) #JanetJackson's #Discipline is an important cultural moment because it is EVERYTHING. recognize.
also reserving the right to claim #Discipline is very very important #JanetJackson album even if I don't have time tonight to get into it...
instead of moving on to #DamitaJo tonight, i'm gonna get some rest. my #JanetJackson album live tweet will resume in the near future. :)
i srlsy need a massive #JanetJackson comeback that completely annihilates pop music as we know it. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS NOT A DRILL
"i used to sit and wonder would i ever be happy?" - #JanetJackson #AllForYou
#realtalk #AllForYou was kinda rough. had some great singles tho. told a cohesive story...which is more than most pop albums #JanetJackson
@Odyism POINT TAKEN. haha. there a couple decent songs on this records tho...
I WANT A NEW JANET JACKSON ALBUM LIKE I WANT WORLD PEACE
if you aren't interested in my #JanetJackson live tweets tonight, i feel sorry for you. what ARE you interested in?!?!
ha ha hoo hoo. thought you'd get the money too. greedy muthafuckas try to have their cake and eat it too. #JanetJackson #AllForYou
the #CarlySimon spot on #AllForYou is more genre defying. no one else was doing this shit! "Son Of A Gun" was EVERYTHING! #JanetJackson
@avatarmenot well if you ever need company, give me a heads up. i'll be there. at very least i'm good for screaming at the DJ to play Bey!!
@avatarmenot what club are you at? if i was in NJ and not brooklyn, i'd come try to dance the pain away with you... :/
"All For You" is pretty ahead of it's time. super futuristic. Janet was doing the damn thing! #JanetJackson #AllForYou
ooooh ooohhh - YOU AIN'T RIGHT! #JanetJackson #AllForYou
@avatarmenot straight people are the worst....ewww....
ok...moving on to #AllForYou with my #JanetJackson listening binge. i feel like this was her turning point in terms of popular appeal. yeah?
y'all know #JanetJackson had 2 albums before #Control tho right? She had Self-Titled and Dream Street. Underrated.
"Special" is the most life-affirming jam to end an album ever. &amp; then it's unfinished. just like we are. #JanetJackson #VelvetRope
@trillnatured i mean...what else am i gonna do on a tuesday night? :)
@janetmock i fear they will find that artist and sting all the same! they are ruthless! haha #TodayInBeyonce - the verdict is no, no, no....
"What About" is maybe the realest, rawest song about hard-to-discuss real-life issues ever created. #JanetJackson #VelvetRope
@janetmock @FactsofBeyonce noooooooooooo. just no. no. no. no.
@ChrisDStedman that was the biggest pop culture travesty. i can't. yep-still SingMH. I'm calling for a Janet revolution. haha!
also - Janet Jackson, Q-Tip, Joni Mitchell. like who would have ever? #JanetJackson "Got Til It's Gone" - GENIUS!
this #JoniMitchell sample in "Got Til It's Gone" tho...more defying genres. more innovation. more brilliance. #JanetJackson #VelvetRope
@lexxiicoop haha! just listening to music and tweeting about it because there's no one here to listen to my opinions. haha.
@ChrisDStedman i am on that same binge tonight!! i can't stop! i may never go to sleep. haha. :)
and now we're moving on to #TheVelvetRope. i don't even think i'm prepared for this tonight...it's beyond...
i know #JanetJackson was repping all these politics on #RhythmNation &amp; #Control. i only got it later after i had listened to janet. cuz age.
then we move straight into an interlude called "Racism" and the song "New Agenda" totally repping #blackfeminism with Chuck D. #JanetJackson
"Funky Big Band" is straight #StevieWonder fire. #JanetJackson the janet. album was so experimental and innovative!!!
#JanetJackson was my #Madonna in the 80s/90s. I thought I was in love with her til I realized I was in love with boys. :/ still love her...
the song "What'll I Do?" from janet. could be on any @JanelleMonae album today. she was ahead of her time! #JanetJackson
so i got to see her twice basically as my very first concert. and i was the dorkiest little white teenager in Utah. you don't even know...
she passed out from dehydration during the show while performing the song "Throb" and the rest had to be rescheduled for another date!
my first concert was #JanetJackson for the janet. tour also. more evidence of how important it was to me.
@ThatManMax it was meant to be!!!!
#JanetJackson never gave up the idea of Interludes either. she rocked the interludes as long as possible. like 20+ tracks per album
@ThatManMax RHYTHM NATION is perfect too. i was too young when it came out to appreciate everything it was saying though. love it now!
defying genre: the Kathleen Battle sample from #JanetJackson &amp; the #ChimamandaNgoziAdichie sample from #Beyonce. WHAT?!?!?!
also, y'all...#JanetJackson's janet. has so much in common with #Beyonc√©'s BEYONC√â record. they are both beyond brilliant &amp; so important...
@ThatManMax i'm just reminiscing right now with my iTunes and remembering the power of this record. it's too good!!
i've always been into music, but the 1st album to make me REALLY FALL IN LOVE with the power of music was #JanetJackson's janet. record
i'm about to live tweet myself listening to all these #JanetJackson albums late into the night because i'm reliving my teenage years...
but...how come no one is talking about #JanetJackson's "Pleasure Principle" alongside #AudreLorde's "Uses of the Erotic"??? #blackfeminism
the pleasure principle = the principle of pleasure. #Control #JanetJackson
"i'm not a fool. i just want some respect, so close the door if you want me to respond." - msssss. jackson!
I feel like getting deep into some Janet Jackson albums tonight...
@ButItsMusuDoe oh true true. the identity of white feminist is a pile of trash. like really gross trash.
@ButItsMusuDoe gross. white feminists are the worst. usually. there's like 5 good ones...
@ButItsMusuDoe ick. haven't seen those yet. don't even wanna look. :(
@ButItsMusuDoe ugh. what have they done now?!? :/
@SKEEerra @QuanTarantino awesome. I'm so undergrad too. I'll fit right in.
@SKEEerra @QuanTarantino wait. can i come????
@janetmock @ButItsMusuDoe @avatarmenot oh I see! y'all are tweeting Janet while you're supposed to be listening to my brilliant lectures! :)
@lexxiicoop @thobekileee oh no! poor keri hilson... (but also, hahaha!)
I have put up with a lot from azealia banks. but you DO NOT come for erykah badu. NOOOOOOOOOO!
@bardwellta bloop 
all I want for Valentine's Day is @GabbySidibe to be my valentine and to drink and make fun of people with me. and maybe dance some.
@GabbySidibe I would perform this song with you. WILL YOU BE MY VALENTINE?
@KevinAllred he tweeted while someone was tattooing his neck
neck tattoos hurt kinda bad...
@YesusWalks it's always REBECCA
i may have just performed an intense lip sync version of #WhitneyHouston's "I Look To You" for my elderly dachshund Honey. she liked it.
i missed #SoPOPular today but can't wait to catch up online on what looks like the most amazing #NYFW coverage evah!! @janetmock #MockFlock
hey america - #politicizingbeyonce is on the move - Los Angeles: see you 2/25; Chicago: see you 3/18; Philly: see you 4/7. CAN'T WAIT!
@lexxiicoop copycat!!! haha everyone knows bey started that trend now. it's cool seeing other people follow though! I'll have to listen.
@violadavis complex perfection!
@YoungBossquiat #HerImpact!!! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> everyone's just trying to catch up!!
My website has been updated to include links to clips of TV appearances and gathers together all my writing in... 
Wait, never mind. I'm screaming. 
Annalise OMG. Shonda, I wasn't ready. #HTGAWM
CICELY TYSON!!!!!! yasssss. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> #HTGAWM
but still tho... can someone murder Rebecca for season 2's murder that will need to get away with... <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN> #HTGAWM
wow. Annalise DID THAT. holy shit... I love it. #HTGAWM
wait. Bonnie's name is Bonnie Winterbottom?? hahahaha. #HTGAWM
@FrockYeah @chescaleigh seriously. just. shut. up. kids. study for a law test or something. haha
@chescaleigh cuz she's always just standing in the corner watching everyone. probably she heard the dummy students confessing every 5 mins.
I'd like to introduce everyone to Bonnie the Boss. #HBIC #HTGAWM
oh snap. sleep with one eye open prosecutor dude. #HTGAWM
but that turquoise necklace looks fab with Annalise's black dress tho... #HTGAWM @violadavis
God, quit being a baby Conner #HTGAWM @RestingPlatypus :)
@tommytebow and she's only been here for like 2 episodes. now that's talent... haha
now I feel bad for Asher. he's so left out. :( #HTGAWM
Annalise is not looking very innocent at the top of those stairs. :/ #HTGAWM
and that's what they called compromised evidence that is no longer admissible in court. BOOM. #HTGAWM
I keep forgetting Asher isn't in on any of this. haha. #HTGAWM
@CourtneyCymone me too!!! but I might like it. haha
you do not get to cross examine the lawyer, Hannah. OBJECTION. #HTGAWM
@googleme_Shawni I'm so done with her. if they need to kill someone else to get away with another murder, REBECCA GETS MY VOTE!
@CourtneyCymone they could do an Annalise/mama pope crossover episode from prison. now I would watch that!!
NOOOO REBECCA. NO ONE BELIEVES YOU. ugh #HTGAWM
@thobekileee wow. they must of known what our class was about today and made this episode just to quiz us! #politicizingBeyonce haha
@CourtneyCymone she'll be the victim of the next murder they have to get away with. haha
@lexxiicoop totally. she's got ulterior motives.
@chescaleigh I know. she's hiding something for sure...
ummm. maybe Rebecca killed Rudy. I know Rebecca killed someone. just throw her in jail already. #HTGAWM
@CourtneyCymone or maybe she knows and she's just as bad as he was. I bet she's got a bad side to show us soon...
@thobekileee YASSSS. good call. they gotta make her the angry black woman somehow!!!!! so stereotypical...
@CourtneyCymone nah, I'm glad they took him out. he was gross.
that's still not probably cause white lady? it's hearsay...and perjury...#HTGAWM
wh-wh-what? Annalise's violent past you say? #HTGAWM
ohhhhh snap! "you gonna arrest me because my grief doesn't look the way you want it to?" YASSS. #HTGAWM
in a secret twist it was Sam's sister all along that killed him and Lila. #HTGAWM
that looked like it was a woman that bought Liv in that promo <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> #Scandal
#scandal just turned into an infomercial for Uncle Sam. :/
aww damn. the gladiators have lost it. #Scandal
why would Vatican City buy Olivia gladiators? get your shit together... #Scandal
#DontNeutralizeOlivia #Scandal
I don't know about you all...but I do not like these #AmericanCrime promos. ewww. #Scandal
is huck supposed to stand for the past tense of hack? I love these puns!! #puns #Scandal
Huck hacks bodies and hacks computers. never thought of that before now. haha. #Scandal
@googleme_Shawni I know! he's in the zone now too. they could get him to throw in the VP for nothing.
MELLIE IS ABOUT TO BE HILLARY CLINTON #Scandal
I bet they could get Huck to take care of the VP if they just asked... #Scandal
"when something happens, YOU HAVE TO TELL ME MY ONLY FRIEND'S BEEN KIDNAPPED." what are the odds? #Scandal
@_aminatah_ they they turned him into a monster. :/ I just want the best for Mellie. haha
@jjohnson9109 @chescaleigh that's what the people wanna seeeeeee! haha
@TopCollab @chescaleigh that's what's gonna make it interesting. :)
HOOLLLLYYYYYYY SHITTTT. Liv spilled more red wine in that room. :/ #Scandal
the vp used to be so sweet. :/ #Scandal
poor huck. everyone's always making him kill people for the better good. #Scandal @guillermodiazyo
shut up David. you've been overruled. #Scandal
wait. put Elizabeth in prison with maya pope and then make a prison spin off a la Orange is the new black. I'm here for that. #Scandal
she wants a library!!! like prince said - "books, albums, and black lives matter!!!" #Scandal
mama pope is gonna win this auction and fuck some shit up. #Scandal
@joyfullybea thank you so much! that's so nice of you. :)
OF COURSE YOU KNOW A TERRORIST!!!! Yessssss. #Scandal
@KevinAllred NO matter. ugh. I do know how to spell. :/
@Reignof_Styles right? that $$$ is just icing on the cake!! haha
oh damn. I don't know what's red wine and what's blood anymore. #Scandal
"all I have is students loans. know matter how many times you change your identity, sallie Mae WILL find you." same. #Scandal
Olivia pope may be powerful but she is NOT "queen of America." that's @Beyonce. duh. #Scandal
I thought america didn't negotiate with terrorists? even if the terrorist is the vice prez. how much they gonna pay for Liv? #Scandal
wait. is mama pope coming back tonight? I need that to be true... #Scandal
@joyfullybea YES!! I would say so! :)
I can't believe that #TheSlap is a show. and that it premieres tonight. or that anyone will watch it. I can't...
@googleme_Shawni yup. so you'll still be caught up.
@googleme_Shawni oh no!! we will miss you!!! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@SmartAssJen <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> my body doesn't understand anything but pizza. I hear you! haha
@learnteachwin I remember that but thought they referenced that he came out later. woops.
also, can't we have a gay storyline that doesn't have to get all complicated through heterosexual activities? jeez... #Empire
raven symone - get the fuck outta here. I can't... #Empire
just had a flashback to when Cookie beat the shit outta Hakeem with the broom. and I liked it. #Empire
@learnteachwin ok. I thought he had after he told off his dad. I was rushing to catch up and missed some of the details I guess :/
@_aminatah_ every episode. haha. :/
I thought Jamal already came out. now he's back in? lee Daniels, CMON  #Empire
cookie is blowing the kisses to everyone. DONT GIVE EM AWAY SO EASY!!! #Empire
Courtney Love is not a soul singer tho...so... #Empire
also Cookie is obsessed with everyone being behind the mix. it should be her #1 request - put them in front of the mix. #Empire
oooohhh shit. cookie's gonna teach Courtney #Empire
I'm not here for boo boo kitty stealing porsha. NO. #Empire
yessss. Courtney love playing herself in the studio. EMMYs. #Empire
@HillaryCrosley I want a spin off where she opens her own PR firm!
@HillaryCrosley she is my 2nd favorite character. she's always doing the most in the background!!!
#noshade but Courtney love is kinda looking like that recent Joni Mitchell photo shoot. not sure what that means. #Empire
"thanks for cumming" - cookie #Empire
@jadetdot @youngsinick it's so bad. but it's so GOOD :)
@zblay it's called acting!!! haha. jk. it's called downers. :/
can season 2 of #empire just get renamed #Cookie. cuz seriously...
also, Courtney Love. WHAT THE FUCK?! #Empire
courtney love. xo  #Empire
if @TherealTaraji just wears this jumpsuit for the full episode tho...WORTH IT #Empire
lessons from lee daniels: gay love is hard when you're about to blow up as a superstar :/ #Empire
I'm most interested in Cookie and Jamal. let's get rid of these other scenes. #Empire @TherealTaraji @JussieSmollett
I'm so confused. do I hashtag #Empire or #EmpireFOX for this????!!
that jumpsuit tho. I'm dead. #EmpireFOX
that @TherealTaraji makes Cookie the most complicated, nuanced character is testament to her ridiculous TALENT. writing is meh. #EmpireFOX
ccccccccccooooooooookkkkkiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeee #Empire
ok #EmpireFOX. my whiskey is poured and my body is READY!!!
@beyasek thanks for posting!! I wrote that! :) #PoliticizingBeyonce
@ChrisDStedman also hi! nice to e-meet. been a fan of your work for a while &amp; i think we know some of the same folks in boston. small world!
@JSaysOnline @JohnnyGolightly true-i just think it was pretty shady that it lost, considering the impact and inventive-ness of that album
@JSaysOnline ALL of them. haha. but I especially love when she says "boo boo kitty"!!
@JSaysOnline @JohnnyGolightly the snub was specifically about the AOTY award which is seen as the most prestigious/most coveted
@ChrisDStedman yass. all the points for making Beyonce lyrics fit conversations!! :)
i'm finally caught up on #Empire so i can watch LIIIIIIVE tonight! #EmpireFOX
my car display said 0 miles until it ran out of gas. I drove it well past 0 miles however.
@CourtneyCymone thank you so much!! :) I'm glad to be connected on here now and see your great Beyonce insight too! :)
@laifrncs wait. who's the host and who's the musical guest?! haha...
#that's what I was saying because this...ALL ABOUT ME." - the ever humble Kyle Richards. #RHOBH
wait. Kyle Richards isn't in this scene. I wonder how she feels about that. hmmmm. #RHOBH
@LissaLaneous ugh I KNOW. she's so self absorbed. but I guess it is reality TV so... :/
I will keep tweeting variations of the same tweet til Kyle Richards acknowledges its not always about her. or I die. either one. #RHOBH
"how else can I make this situation about ME!" - Kyle Richards every time she speaks. #RHOBH
"WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?" - every time Kyle Richards opens her mouth. #RHOBH
just saw some cops texting while driving. cool. I've gotten an expensive ticket for checking the time on my phone behind the wheel. hmmmmm
Finally an indictment!! RT "@RantingOwl: Officer Peter Liang has been indicted for the shooting of Akai Gurley
