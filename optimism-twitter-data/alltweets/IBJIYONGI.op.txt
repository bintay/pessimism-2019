@DrDa5id my husband is hilariously the walking personification of #3
@DrDa5id have you seen that Fung brothers video? About whether Asian men like Black women?
@KevinShawnHsu ethnic studies majoring, black friend having, rap music listening Asian man!
@KevinShawnHsu this goes to show that you should never mess with a type #3's wife lol
@astrojohnjohn hey @KevinShawnHsu your complaints were heard
@ja_pascoe @drspacejunk @IamnotnotBatman yeah I think we know why. Just saying blaming guns doesn't address that.
@MichaelSchwandt have you considered using a nicer tone?
@MichaelSchwandt you're very angry sounding
@drspacejunk @IamnotnotBatman of course each settler colonial country seems to have a problem w/violence against non-whites
@drspacejunk @IamnotnotBatman and a gun isn't what killed #FreddieGray
@drspacejunk @IamnotnotBatman but none of this explains why Blacks don't survive while whites do
@drspacejunk @IamnotnotBatman I think a lot of countries have stringent rules about use of guns and we just don't
@bengreenman that guy is the worst
@AGuyNamedNam @alendrel yes yes yes yes yes
Police afraid he was going to lose consciousness. So better to take a life than have a Black boy run away? Fuck that. #TonyRobinson
What kind of weak ass police think that killing someone for punching them is a reasonable reaction? #TonyRobinson
This is a convo I now have with a mentee: if u go out into the streets, have a lawyer's # on your arm in permanent marker #TonyRobinson
One of my Black woman mentees just texted me to say that #TonyRobinson death has been ruled lawful. This is Black womanhood in physics.
@chgreer this probably explains on some level how white repro-organizing often is and why WOC often organize in other frameworks
@chgreer questions can also be tagged #protectmaunakea and #aoletmt so kanaka oiwi can see and respond if they want
@chgreer I think people are in it to win.
@chgreer so do you go into repro-rights organizing thinking about how to compromise with GOP on abortion?
In relation to my last tweet, "intersectionality" is an organizing framework with a rich history. I think a lot of ppl don't get that.
@chgreer def think a big problem in this discourse is that a lot of astronomers don't understand how social justice organizing happens
@chgreer but also social justice movements rarely succeed because they started with "what are we willing to give up?"
@chgreer I think the best thing would be to see what activists have to say for themselves. Not my place to talk compromise for them.
@chgreer I don't think that's a good starting point for conversation.
.@sacredmaunakeawordpress has compiled links to my writing about #protectmaunakea and #decolonizestem 
.@astrojohnjohn reposted my blog entry about how racism multiplies with a very interesting preface: 
This is extremely fun: Rogue antimatter found in thunderclouds 
@xayma haha, a man after my grandfather's heart. he thought baseball fans were so uncouth.
thinking a bit about @teagazer's tweets about leaving and how field never feels obligated to try to keep us
@ashpags no one ever responds to my tweets about k-pop!! lol
@MatSciMatt grad school is a scary place.
the faster we all get on board with this, the more I can just write tweets about k-pop that you'll ignore :-)
why do I think that the whole world was structured to disempower me? Because actually it was. POC are real victims of a real conspiracy.
but if your reaction is "this is not believable" I agree, it's unbelievably outrageous. yet it's real and scary as fuck.
I vocalize it bc it is a matter of survival and bc I am a scientist who believes the world is better when we share data.
that your local POC isn't vocalizing every 5 minutes that the racism has hit them again is a sign of how strong we have to be
often white ppl are like "you talk race constantly, I feel bombarded, it's over the top" but racism is constant, bombarding and over the top
@MatSciMatt if you don't pass, you will dust yourself off and try again. :-)
@The_Adrift it was the business section. very telling, in my opinion.
Would love to see the TMT fb account reflect some thoughtfulness beyond "we are right, pour concretes already!!!11!!1!"
@SCTrager @kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer prob why I had the idea for one haha
@SCTrager @kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer I think I would have fun teaching a course like that
@SCTrager @kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer my stiefvader will appreciate that as a groningen (business) alum
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer yeah that wouldn't work in Canada either
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer @RiPhysKin and this could fulfill one humanities requirement for Gen Ed
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer @RiPhysKin think in long term phys curric should include req hist of phys course
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer @RiPhysKin I would incl things like reading about Islamic contribution to physics
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer I think @RiPhysKin has this somewhat covered possibly
@drannawatts @SCTrager @kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer my computers/devices are all named after K-drama stars/characters now
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer I'll give my ideas away if/when I leave the field :-)
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer interesting questions for example about where copernicus got heliocentric model
@kevinschawinski @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer you should share the decolonizing science reading list with them
@drannawatts @SCTrager hahahahahahahaha
@SCTrager @kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer I named my NASA computer Banneker
@SCTrager @kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer I have some ideas I wanted to try on syllabi in relation but never get to.
@kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @SCTrager @teagazer not the problems I would have wanted to discuss though, incidentally
@kevinschawinski @dalcantonJD @SciBry @SCTrager @teagazer I mentioned here other day that a VIP talked to me abt problems in div grp at AAS
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @kevinschawinski @SCTrager @teagazer notably many very big names are active in astro grp but are often silent w/trolls
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @kevinschawinski @SCTrager @teagazer and I'm like yeah "now imagine if they had fewer people watching"
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @kevinschawinski @SCTrager @teagazer they're like "wow, ppl are willing to say that in a diversity group!!!"
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @kevinschawinski @SCTrager @teagazer ppl have commented to me that stuff in diversity group has helped them see
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @kevinschawinski @SCTrager @teagazer I think it gives me written evidence since ppl often don't trust oral data
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @kevinschawinski @SCTrager @teagazer I think it has helped people see some of the things I had noticed from in person
@kevinschawinski @SciBry @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @teagazer my current fave is the python for astro group. no BS.
@SciBry @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @teagazer I get zero notifications for any sci groups on fb, haha. Mental health necessity!
@dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer but yeah, it's new completely fearless people every time!
@SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer group is unique combo of people who can't hear themselves &amp; righteous justice for white men seekers
@SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer I mean I laughed til I cried and then laughed some more
@SCTrager @dalcantonJD @SciBry @teagazer gotta be honest and say things are such that I laughed my way through a TMT thread yesterday
theorists and experimentalists in symbiosis: 
.@adamlambert's "ghost town" is A+ pop music.
@teagazer @dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff part of me feels like falling in love with cosmology is one of the worst things 2 happen 2 me.
@teagazer @dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff a dear friend told me, "you can't eating the pain like this bc you resent the science"
@teagazer @dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff I grok in all its utter wtf :-|
In which I forget I'm listening to a playlist I curated and think, "wow this person has excellent taste in music" lol
And we are back to this tweet again: 
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees part of those consequences? I think my skillset is lit unimaginable for a lot of ppl with hiring power.
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees which returns me to my early point that this stuff has epistemological consequences.
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees I think the diff has to do w/ white supremacist patriarchy being less obstructive to my vision
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees I sometimes feel like I take correct use of data -- broadly -- more seriously than everyone else
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees coincidentally, to me this is all actually "just doing science the way we were taught"
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees and also better guidelines about providing citations in BI for statements about UR groups
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees I would love to see more than one URM per panel
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees reading BI right now is an exercise in "how will this proposal microaggress me?"
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees I actually think I'd be a good person to do this if only bc of self protection
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff real change is going to require people to face real risk
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff I think this is where the discourse about "accomplice" vs. "ally" becomes important.
@astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @mcnees yes, that's a good idea. deadline for proposals is a couple of weeks :-)
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff In either case, I don't think being on the job market and thinking about leaving is a coincidence.
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff for example mentioning it in their broader impacts proposals
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff and also, not contributing financially to NSBP and then relying heavily on our work
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff I would probably enjoy research more if that was physically colocated/integrated for me
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff schools are relying on unwaged work of scholars of color and then not hiring them.
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff right, I think this exemplifies exactly what I mean. structure is problematic.
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff I'm mentoring students from schools across the country. Those schools, frankly, owe me $$$.
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff are unpaid volunteers like NSBP members carrying the load for schools that won't get it together?
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff what mentors are being made available for those students?
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff ultimately says what department priorities are for undergrad and grad support too
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff and not prioritizing placement of people who will enact needed change
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff some of the things that were said to me about my race and gender by hiring people were not good
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff all the unconscious bias during faculty votes, ppl going with their guts,ppl not prioritizing difference
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff second order questions: were women or men more likely to get multiple offers, for example
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff yes, white patriarchal supremacy reproducing itself will do so regardless of numbers
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff when that wasn't such a big problem, academia was even whiter
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff for me the jobs:workers ratio is a separate issue from the abusive dynamics
@kejames @niais I have to do it manually
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @astroprofhoff for me this is not a problem point. Abuses of power and reproduction of -isms would occur regardless.
@astroprofhoff which I think often disproportionately negatively impact POC
@astroprofhoff I am hoping this will also serve to get people to interrogate their anti-religion attitudes
@astroprofhoff @mandaYoho @mcnees but also not realizing that their hell is hell-lite compared to others.
@astroprofhoff well, we are using some of the work that Mormon feminists have done to improve astro/physics, so she's having some success!
@mandaYoho @mcnees @astroprofhoff yup, that's exactly what I mean. people were abused so now they abuse.
@mcnees @astroprofhoff interesting when physicists get intellectually lazy :-)
@The_Adrift @astroprofhoff time to move to Alberta
@mcnees @astroprofhoff and q we should all be asking: what are the epistemological consequences of this network running basic science?
@mcnees @astroprofhoff one of the q's I've been asking myself is "why work so hard to join this network?"
@astroprofhoff so we get a lot of people who have been abused engaging in abuse in order to maintain their position+some stockholm syndrome
@astroprofhoff and I think it's hostile even for straight white cismen, and selects for people willing to engage in hostile behaviors
@astroprofhoff my general feeling for years is that academia is fundamentally an abusive organizing structure
@astroprofhoff being on the job market is one way to see another axis of dysfunction in our community
@astroprofhoff yup, this has been a super excellent 6 months /sarcasm
@Ms_Gravitas I think that physicists are rather regressive socially and ppl let them get away with it bc "smart ppl are weird"
I keep getting invitations to do things in the fall. But I don't know where I will be living .....
Does anyone know of any recorded readings of Audre Lorde's Sister, Outsider? #BlackGirlsAreMagic #BlackSpring
@Vasugi has ideas
If @Vasugi says I'm drunk don't believe her
@Vasugi this autocorrect policy is going swimmingly
@Vasugi because I want to be sick in the mor OMG lol
@Vasugi damnit I backspaces
@Vasugi I'm pretty sure that's how this is working
@Vasugi also am at that stage of the evening where I am willing to let autocorrect write shit for me
@Vasugi mmmm brains
Hey do any #EpikHigh #highschoolers know who the 6/12 special guest is?
@Vasugi does that mean it's time for a bbq?
@salesses @nicole_soojung @Vasugi insert joke about country of Africa and country of Asia
@salesses @nicole_soojung there can only ever be one single issue!

@rgairnelson @astrojohnjohn that's depressing/glad to be of service. Ah, racism. Such a special bag.
@astrojohnjohn @kejames I am exhausted from trying to keep up with the character assassination and science at the same time. It's obscene.
@astrojohnjohn @kejames my feeling right now is that if I could write this again, I would. Or staple it to some people's foreheads.
fascinating that this was in the business section: How a $1.4-billion scientific project ran into a cultural buzz saw 
Remarkable gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster Abell 3827 
@mandaYoho oh? I think it's easier to miss stuff on twitter. link?
@dalcantonJD it's pretty depressing. leading URM advocates turning on URMs.
@dalcantonJD I just kind of want to be like "yeah, I sounded pissed off. I was being attacked, and you joined in." That's NORMAL, FOLKS.
@dalcantonJD it ended up being one of 2 posts over the course of 4 days that were not so subtly an attack on me Sarah John and a few others
@dalcantonJD and some leaders in our real world community said some pretty messed up stuff.
@dalcantonJD me and others, per: 
@dalcantonJD yeah I had actually tried to check out of the group, but then I heard about a post attacking "hostile POC" which obv meant
@dalcantonJD so like "hey, I will engage in character assassination, but won't take responsibility for it!"
@dalcantonJD on top of everything, person couldn't take responsibility of directly calling me names, but was obvious in context who he meant
@niais @dalcantonJD "what I said isn't racist because I care about fighting racism" = not logical, just defensive
@niais @dalcantonJD people seriously hate the suggestion that they have to work for their titles to be deserved, not rest on laurels
@dalcantonJD but honestly, if he feels like the glove fits, maybe he should work that out.
@dalcantonJD so this person assumes because he's passive aggressive that I am and then gets angry at me for a label that wasn't for him
@dalcantonJD actually didn't point the finger at the person who took it personally, which is another issue: stop projecting pagro crap on me
@dalcantonJD was also labeled aggressive for noting similarities btw some of the discourse and white supremacist organizing language
@dalcantonJD I said really mean things like "come on man, you're the **** of ***** and shouldn't be supporting that stuff." Very aggressive.
@dalcantonJD one person was upset because I called them out for endorsing a blatantly racist diatribe
And if your pro society's official voice on matters of racial minorities is one of the participants: UHHHHHHHHHH, what are you doing?
If your diversity group has members spending time piling on a Black woman for being "aggressive": that is some bullsheeeeeit
But also by the way, when you call a woman aggressive, you've also seeded that she's right and you're being an asshole.
I'm not naming the powerful white guy who called me aggressive bc I'm hoping he'll come to his senses and apologize for his gendered racism.
Calling a woman aggressive: it's sexist &amp; shows you're at the edge of your ability to talk. If she's Black, you're hitting stereotypes too.
@bradajczyk @maureenjohnson thank you!
I know people think I'm a born hater, so here is something I love: 
watch this because beenzino is hot and also it's good: 
@SHINeeRTs @supp0rtShinee #shawol &lt;3 forever
If you like good dancing, you will want to watch the SHINee video I just posted.
WELL HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS: SHINEE IS RELEASING A NEW ALBUM IN A WEEK 
@SiouxperNova haha, sorry lady but you've got quals so I wouldn't trade on the hard work front :-P (I passed two sets already!) @Lei_kananz
Accomplices not allies: 
Actual next blog post: using the word "aggressive" to hurt and attack people of color.
@CLScientist @LitsaDremousis @DNLee5 @xtycon epic!!! @lejostark !
I think other people should wish that I wasn't getting material for my blogs because they're getting a lot of hits.
I wish people would stop giving me material for my blog entries.
@ashleenwilkins hahaha, that might be ok. I like that plan.
@Lei_kananz look @SiouxperNova, it opens with your very important tweet!
@Lei_kananz oh wow!
@QuantumP7 a group for equity and inclusion in physics and astro. Membership is frozen but you may be interested in joining when it opens.
@astrojohnjohn @gsnarayan @sondy @erinleeryan @astroprofhoff think I'd need several hours with my therapist for how fucked up this has been
@ltbikes I was careful not to bring "semantics" into it I guess is my point. Anyway I guess we just differ here.
@ltbikes if you read her Twitter feed she actually insisted on that meaning but said it didn't have the implications it clearly did
@ltbikes *ambiguous
@ltbikes in this case I think it was the content what she said, not her word choice. I'm being polite when I say at best it was impolite
@gsnarayan @sondy @astrojohnjohn @erinleeryan @astroprofhoff I actually think my anger is at the pt of making me physically ill today
Hey @facebook can you make it possible to download a thread for offline reading?
@ltbikes I would not at all call this a matter of semantics.
@ABlackTweeter just wanted to ensure I wasn't usurping credit! Cool :-)
@cfroning I think the lack of self awareness is a problem and you're modeling an alternative so that's good!
@cfroning it does seem to say a lot about people's families. Folks need to stop projecting though.
@ABlackTweeter I can't take credit for it: 
Not tiptoeing around white fragility doesn't make me aggressive. It makes me a Black person who knows she's five fifths.
"I don't think you're using appropriate language" sounds aggressive coming from me if you're a racist I guess.
Also for the record, this is what it looks like when I am being aggressive: "you are an asshole." "You are wrong" is not it.
For the record, I do not fucking do passive aggressive. It's cowardly.
I find that a significant percentage of my conflicts of white people involve them being passive aggressive and/or assuming I am being pagro.
If you want to laugh til you cry, watch the @aamer_rahman video
@aamer_rahman kills it on the U.S. and #OsamaBinLaden 
Realizing that I feel like being in the center for theoretical physics feels incongruent with listening to Jodeci. :-|
I forgot to put my marriage rings on this morning. My hand feels very weird.

@dgettings @astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan thanks everyone. :-)
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan only so many times these pass-aggr things can happen b4 it starts to look like a burning cross
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan but maybe good for people to let others know they are watching
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan my suspicion is that if something happens, I won't know about it.
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan *fear
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan ear the network doesn't work at the level of postdoc protection, which is why I would be a first
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan especially now that we know complaint emails are flying around
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan "let's post X on fb as a personal attack" or "let's make phone calls to hiring committees"
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan I guess if people want to behave like they're in skull and bones eh
@michael_w_busch I've been meaning to listen but I've been distracted. Thanks for the reminder!
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan like, are we talking about potential active, aggressive abuses of power?
@astrojohnjohn @astroprofhoff @erinleeryan well it's one thing if it's just junior people, and it's another thing if it's senior people
@astroprofhoff @erinleeryan @astrojohnjohn I'll be honest that it feels like attempts at intimidation bc some whites feel uncomfortable
@AstroKatie sorry to hear you've been feeling panicked :-| @erinleeryan @astroprofhoff
@erinleeryan @astroprofhoff paired with: someone senior pulled me aside @ AAS to talk abt "someone in grp" w/a tone problem @astrojohnjohn
@erinleeryan @astroprofhoff Multiple comments/posts makes me think there is a group at work.
@erinleeryan Maybe I sound paranoid but I think going after me was part of the original plan?
@docfreeride I've been accused of a lot of things, but threatening people has never been one of them. That's new!
@erinleeryan because I started my sentence with "But, if you would like"? I know, don't try to find logic. I suppose that's possible eh.
One slight problem: I'm not sure exactly what the nature of the threat was. Does anyone know?
It turns out I'm not just a snake. I am a THREATENING SNAKE.
@astrojohnjohn There is already a link to a storify that has Faber/Filippenko email but sure, Meg's tweets
@astrojohnjohn sure as long as you link to the original and maintain the integrity of the links contained in it!
@boldandworthy no reason to apologize! No worries.
@boldandworthy not a mom, but a happy aunty :-)
Mothers Day conversation with @sotrueradio: 
When someone says you engaged in racism, it's not an attack on ur entire existence. When you are racists against me, it IS an attack on mine
@cerena this must be hard to write and even so, important and I am thankful
@mcnees omg, excellent!
@BenLillie of interest
@DNLee5 @MinorityPostdoc @docfreeride @niais @astrojohnjohn @dalcantonJD @LokiVolcano @berkeleyjess
I encourage everyone to read "Oops, you did racism a favor" so that you can understand how small racist errors grow: 
@mcnees I am ready to live with this New Order.
I just published “Oops, you did racism a favor” 
What is my point? That white ppl sound fucking ridiculous when they whine abt how hurtful it is to them to have racist behavior pointed out.
I hope that for the rest of my life, the biggest thing I have to fear from police is them calling me RACIST in all caps.
@lilytsui I may have said something like "POC can go fuck themselves. Got it."
@lilytsui I actually did use some foul language which generally speaking I work to avoid
@amandajhelling My interests are pretty broad :-) History is one of my favorite subjects.
@AstroHyde does it have an iOS app too?
Real talk: how did Cromwell not see the problems with betrothing Elizabeth to a Catholic prince coming?
@johannateske agreed. It also happens to be very important for our work because we are professional problem solvers.
@GrumpyKelson more cowbell
And yes, #notallastronomers etc.
@KLambPhD @DNLee5 @Summer_Ash I wish I knew how to code for iOS, I could probably make a fortune fixing this gap
@KLambPhD @DNLee5 @Summer_Ash flipboard doesn't have an offline download option?
This week in how members of the American Astro Society handled discourse about racism, in sum: 
What is a good app/site for bookmarking articles that turns them into an iPad-friendly magazine of sorts?
just got this hilarious text message from a friend: I am on a treadmill next to a guy in suspenders
Being a good scientist means being able to accept where you are wrong and creatively commit to becoming more right.
Tired of sci being so simple about integrity. Being told you are imperfect is not an attack on your integrity. Integrity = will to grow.
I think all scientists should read this book: Objectivity | The MIT Press 
@niais @gayathrikamath would certainly ward off my asshole ex-bf who was terrified of snakes lol
@niais @gayathrikamath or via my friend Colin: "Let'sssss explore the cosmosssss"
@niais @gayathrikamath well, if the family lore is right and we are from Benin and Ghana, there is this: 
@LokiVolcano hehehehehe
@gayathrikamath @niais I want a hat-wearing snake.
@sondy @niais @gayathrikamath I guess that means yesterday there was a motherfuckin snake on some motherfuckin planes

Wherever you are in the world, find out when Sunday's #GPEspana begins in Barcelona. #F1 
.@niais look I am a snake wearing a hat! @gayathrikamath
@berkeleyjess @DNLee5 @niais @astrojohnjohn @Meg_Urry @docfreeride this is some of the best writing on dealing with a fuck up gracefully
@LokiVolcano thanks! I hope all the teaching is going well :-)
@gayathrikamath omg this is adorable
@michael_w_busch I am most distressed that one of them is supposed to be the lead advocate for people like me.
@michael_w_busch honestly, I'm crying right now. I should be sleeping, but I am too stunned by all of the things I saw today.
I think my best facebook comment of today was: "good god, I just made the mistake of reading this thread."
so, sci, what is the point in thinking that someone's niche interest in your field is stupid if it's not harmful? why not live and let live?
These scientists just lost their lives in the Arctic. They were heroes. 
Today in astronomy: call out racism, get called a snake trying to eat poor white people. OK.
@The_Adrift well, it's been established that "hordes" is off limits, so we've moved on to referring to POC as animals now.
My husband is reading a facebook thread about racism where someone referred to me as a snake. Listening to him smack his head is funny.
@Enceladosaurus @sondy @niais @QuantumP7 of course if the world was full of ppl with these symptoms, we'd have innovated for it already
@QuantumP7 have you written about your experience? @Enceladosaurus @niais
@Enceladosaurus @niais @QuantumP7 I've done okay despite it because I had the privilege of being able to push through w/o accommodation
@QuantumP7 @Summer_Ash @niais I will write a separate post about it probably because it has impacted me quite differently from other things
@QuantumP7 They impact my experience, but not as significantly as other people with other disabilities I think.
@QuantumP7 I have some physical disabilities from a car accident that happened when I was 19, and I also have PTSD.
.@niais which is more depressing: the funding situation for astronomy or today's facebook threads? I think this is a competitive situation.
@struthious of course, and I might even take someone saying that seriously if they convinced me in a way that showed power awareness
So by the way, I completely left discussion of my disabilities out of 
@teagazer @niais let's just think about Alberta
In my community, we believe concepts of objectivity are determined by power dynamics. Dom culture believes objectivity determine by them lol
So if I am direct I am angry and not being objective and if I am offended I need to accept that's how scientists are. Great spot for POC.
Ex of cultural fit issue: in my community direct but considerate is valued. Dom culture: passive aggressive expected, inconsiderate excused.
Hey dominant culture scientists: in case you were worried, and many seem to be, that we URMs don't know we aren't fitting in, we do. Thanks.
Listening to @KaeSun for strength and calm. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>🏽
Friends don't let friends be racists.
If you say something racist, and I don't call you out, it means I probably don't like you very much.
@Mad_Science_Guy it's not all Miliband's fault. Tony Blair will haunt them for a long time.
@Mad_Science_Guy I am very pleased about the SNP gains!
cue the people telling me that calling someone who is being a white supremacist an asshole is unprofessional and unwarranted namecalling
@johannateske @augustmuench I think with the NSF you can actually say "don't have this person evaluate"?
@augustmuench I guess I need to keep a list of people who should be excluded and make sure their names are on my exclusion list, lol
Since no newspaper can publish this, I will do it for them: MILIBAND'S LABOUR ROYALLY, UNBELIEVABLY FUCK THAT UP lol #ukelection2015
@augustmuench basically. but I also imagine that if certain cosmologists get a proposal from me, they are not likely to be fair.
@augustmuench the people on the panel have been great, but the choice we have to make is extremely sad.
@augustmuench but I am highly aware of how these panels are another potential site of abuse, say if someone I disagreed w/is evaluating me
@augustmuench altho right now it just means it's not being applied to writing depressing NSF panel summaries. Our funding situation is shit.
@augustmuench yeah, that should be a slogan! "don't be the safe guy for white supremacists!"
@augustmuench Imagine if I was free to apply that brilliance to sci because all white people were doing their own work on white supremacy!
Raise your hand if you are interested in feeling good at the expense of victims of white supremacy!
Who can tell the difference between the Astronomers fb group and the Diversity in Physics and Astronomy fb group right now? Not me.
You had ONE job UK voters. One job.
How to respond to people who are calling you out about racism: 
I can't fucking believe the #ukelection2015 results. what the fuck? I guess after Alberta, something horrible had to balance it out ....
argumentum ad hominem tu quoque: 
folks, I just learned that argumentum ad hominem tu quoque is a thing, and wow do privileged folks/academics like to use that one a lot!
My mom @sotrueradio Margaret Prescod speaking at the MLK Memorial in DC last weekend 2 May 2015 :-D 
@KeoluFox @hipubradio @solomonout @ProtectMaunaKea @nprnews shout out to @emilylurice!
@TRobert7 nope
@duetosymmetry or at least used to lol
@duetosymmetry in my personal exp w/her, she does an excellent job of acting for the media like she is a down to earth, nice person :-)
@philosovashka cool! I had the first, but not the second. Overall disappointed to find very little discourse about astro/physics in the lit.
@duetosymmetry coincidentally, her shoulders and hair were not covered in the photos that went with these comments, lol
@duetosymmetry rich coming from her since the ballerina who did most of that role was bullied out of credit as part of the oscar campaign
@duetosymmetry no, seriously, she said she doesn't display it because it's a false idol!!
Ridiculous: Natalie Portman called her Oscar a false idol. Wait, maybe not ridiculous since most of the role was performed by someone else!
@NinaLytton I was born &amp; raised in L.A. But my parents both grew up in British colonies, Barbados &amp; Trinidad, before moving to the US &amp; UK.
@smeets @KevinShawnHsu had one girl from California insist I was not Californian once. that was weird.
@smeets @KevinShawnHsu there are some words I don't pronounce the American way though thanks to commonwealth parents, so maybe that's it
@smeets @KevinShawnHsu I agree, but tell that to the people who kept asking me if I was Canadian even before I had been to Canada!
So, even tho my day included a trip to urgent care for a sprain, I would said it didn't go down hill until about 7:30. Keeps going down tho.
OMFG FASTLANE WHY
Today would have been my friend Richard's 28th bday, which makes it the one year anniversary of the last time I saw him alive. Tough.
How could ppl make a discussion about the racism faced by minorities about the TMT? This is kind of a riddle, but not really bc it happened.
My go-to essay for deconstructing this kind of "rationality": 
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan although in the end, I prefer someone who is douchey openly
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan I'm not even talking about changing what they want to do, but it is possible to sound less douchey
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan I mean, for better or for worse, the oil companies do a pretty good job of looking good while being big oil
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan but it never occurs to them, lol (I of course am not for sale)
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan coincidentally, people would do well to pay someone like me to help them avoid these kinds of missteps
What does it mean to do math ethically? Should we have a h…
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan some TMT people see this as TMT vs. anti-racists and don't realize what that says about them
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan it's like a go-to for "what do some white people think Natives  should want for themselves?"
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan this is the account that regularly posts things in a problematic way: 
@zanderhberg this is a HUGE problem in STEM, especially the physical sciences
@Enceladosaurus @erinleeryan just follow the TMT fb account. They're captains of being heavy handed/not sensitive at all.
@Enceladosaurus @elakdawalla Yes. if I say "white ppl need to stop participating in white supremacy" it's apparently the same as "hordes"
@erinleeryan @Enceladosaurus because you know who can say "but this will hurt us!"
@erinleeryan @Enceladosaurus yeah, I think you know why that's never going to happen, at least not without a lot of external pressure
@Enceladosaurus @elakdawalla she's a very cogent writer, so we should take her at her word.
@zanderhberg yes, it's exhausting.
@elakdawalla as one person pointed out, we should all remember this when nominations and elections come up.
@elakdawalla there have definitely been many from astro/physics people like myself who are concerned that AAS do the right thing
@astroprofhoff if I had more time, I might red pen this.
@elakdawalla and also in the middle of #BlackSpring, everyone should know there's a difference between being white and POC in this country
@elakdawalla I think unfortunately it undercuts some of the real strengths by throwing POC in path of "don't be racist toward me" arguments
Suggesting that senior white ppl in astro are potential victims of racism is inappropriate &amp; offensive to ppl actually experiencing racism.
I think one way to look at the statement from Meg Urry is as a jumping off point for seeing what our leadership does and does not understand
@niais and I could probably start a twitter account that red pens all the ways people in astro talk incorrectly about race and racism lol
I am glad to see @AAS_Office finally publish a statement of some kind, but I hope next time we do better.
Until all white ppl realize this, we will keep having problems with racism. Admitting you have a problem requires admitting how it works.
Talking about racism toward white people is nonsense. White people are not on the disempowered end of a series of racialized structures.
I hope very much that while people applaud what is good about this letter, they look at it with a critical eye to see its problems too.
It is however, deeply problematic, to compare the structural racism faced by POC w/ prejudice that may be faced by ppl in tent of whiteness.
I think the statement makes strong points about the unacceptability of racist language.
Statement from @AAS_Office President @Meg_Urry about the use of racist language in discourse about astro: 
inspired me to learn about "sankofa" 
@tomr_stargazer a lot of us in the Black comm, particularly of my generation, also hear it as a reference to the film, which is worth seeing
2 Hawaiian HS students have launched a petition about Mauna Kea and have gotten some hate mail from adults about it: 
@merrdiff @sondy @mcnees @duetosymmetry just found out i can use another code. can now take a break to take a swollen finger to the doctor!
@brianwolven @sondy @mcnees @duetosymmetry it's for a new code
@duetosymmetry @sondy @mcnees fortran is still fundamental in cosmology :-)
what's a good open source fortran 2003 compiler that is not gfortran? @sondy @mcnees @duetosymmetry ?
FYI, I have a twitter rule: if I ask you to stop tweeting at me and you keep going, I mute you.
@ErgoOne can you please respect my last message to you?
@ErgoOne so no need to continue tagging me in the tweets, thanks.
@ErgoOne ok, I see you have something you want to say, but it actually doesn't have anything to do with what I was trying to say
@ErgoOne ummm, the Holocaust? what does it have to do with my tweets?
@ErgoOne I specifically did not use anti-semitism because too often people forget that Jews aren't the only semites.
@aireadee @TheRoot 
@aireadee I really have to write about this, don't I? no response from @TheRoot :-|
it is actually not Pro-Palestinian or otherwise pro-people of color to engage in anti-Jewish racism.
I hope people of color realize that when they engage in anti-Jewish behavior, they are emboldening Zionists, which harms Palestinians.
hey tweeps, esp fellow Black ones, join me in asking @TheRoot why they would RT anti-Jewish tweet w/o qualification: 
@Vasugi @Vana1831 @TheRoot @SeekWisdomPCW this is especially painful to see for those of us who are Black and Jewish to get it on both sides
@Vasugi @Vana1831 @TheRoot @SeekWisdomPCW because ultimately it harms us and helps others feel justified in doing the same against us
@Vasugi @Vana1831 @TheRoot @SeekWisdomPCW and I think part of uplifting our community is not reproducing ethnicist and racist behavior
@Vasugi @Vana1831 @TheRoot @SeekWisdomPCW I know that as Blacks we absolutely hate it when ppl use stereotypes of Black ppl to name call
@Vana1831 you "have a reputation as the 'Jew' of the family"? @SeekWisdomPCW @TheRoot I love you guys, but this should have been called out
@allisonkilkenny ALL CAPS WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW AND SHIT. I hope this doesn't fuck things up for Kamala &amp; California.
Blog idea: "how to tell if you are being used as a prop/using people as props" #decolonizeastronomy
White scientists often use URMs as props, and it sucks. It has def happened to me. 
@octopusdespot that makes my tweet infinitely funnier
So, by the way, contrary to what my commonwealth-tinged accent might indicate, I'm still from California and not Canadian :-D
Rachel Notley is what Justin Trudeau wishes he could be.
"To the people of Alberta: the government belongs to you and you will be treated with respect." -- Rachel Notley, @albertaNDP

@albertaNDP: women winning on good progressive politics! Someone tell the #Hillary2016 fans that there is another way!!!! #albertavote
"There is no future for the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta. The value they shared was power. It's gone." -- commentator on CBC
@sammikes the crowd hates him! weak applause
@sammikes If I were Jim Prentice, I'd be crying on the microphone right now
"When you talk billion dollar mistakes, the PC hasn't saved a nickel since the 80s." ahahahaha
@sammikes I guess I'm too lazy to look up the riding he comes from haha
@sammikes any idea if Harper has an NDP MLA now?!
FB commenter writes that the #albertavote results are "like the inhabitants of the Death Star voting for Luke Skywalker."
"Albertans have been reluctantly voting PC since 2004" LOLOLOL
@datadivajf @WinterLightHome NDP wants processing to happen locally and not in Texas, so possibly
@robcruickshank my ex-wife grew up in Alberta too, and yes, I have that impression!
@tanyaofmars I'm hearing that over half the caucus will be women!??
"The power of incumbancy means nothing tonight in Alberta." -- @CBCCalgary @CBCEdmonton
Thank you for being loving, hopeful and optimistic, Alberta!!! #albertavote 
Anyone who has gotten an email from me in the last few years has seen Jack Layton's name at the bottom of it. This is his legacy. &lt;3
@tanyaofmars HIGH FIVE!!!!!!!!!!! HIGH TEN!!!!!!!!! I'm having warm memories of shaking hands with Jack and Olivia during 08 election night!
@The_Adrift it's still racist as fuck, don't worry lol
CBC HAS CALLED THE ALBERTA GOVERNMENT FOR @albertaNDP HOLY FUCKBALLS PEOPLE, THE ORANGE WAVE IS CRASHING DOWN ON CANADA'S TAR SANDS
@The_Adrift leading 54 ridings!!!!!!
@tanyaofmars I AM SO STOKED! Now when do we get Olivia Chow back at the Federal level?
I AM ALL CAPS FOR @albertaNDP TONIGHT! AMAZING!!! #albertavote
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING IS HAPPENING IN CANADA RIGHT NOW. NDP! NDP! NDP! NDP!
GO NDP IN ALBERTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LEADING 47 RIDINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!
@brandonrambles next time I'm in webcaspar I will look :-)
@brandonrambles happen to have a guesstimate about numbers in biochem? Curious about comparison.
This list is missing a few names but if you're curious about Black American women in physics-related areas,more here: 
DR. CACEY STEVENS HAS JUST BECOME THE ~81ST BLACK WOMAN TO GET A PHD IN A PHYSICS-RELATED AREA. ONE OF THE 1ST 55 IN PHYSICS! #BLACKANDSTEM
For the record, @TIDALHiFi's "Discovery" thing for new artists is working on me. @beatsmusic and @iTunes radio have not achieved this for me
my favorite fb comment of the day: "Foot meet mouth. Why can't people just take criticism and stfu"
@niais but garlic
@niais ahahahahaha
@niais are you calling me a tree?! That's not lemons either!!!
Sometimes life throws you garlic and you're like, this isn't a lemon, how am I supposed to make fucking lemonade?!? #truestory
My friend Nick Konidaris is a mensch. :-)
Feeling like they fit in was the most important factor for whether white women and minorities stayed in physics according to recent studies.
@Izz145 Bush lied, people like HRC went along with it, other people died. (it's longer, but true)
not predictable: also tweeting my other @wwpj favorite: We Were Promised Jetpacks - It's Thunder &amp; It's Lightning 
@Izz145 my feeling about HRC's vote is that she's either not very smart or a liar and an asshole, people need to take their pick
firefox reminds me I've already tweeted the thing I was going to tweet. I'm predictable: 
"Reflecting on Being Indigenous – Peoples Born of and With Our Lands! In Solidarity!" 
Who just had a brief moment of motion sickness from noticing the moon had moved? Me. The physics knowing brain is a funny place.
@ashleenwilkins I think you had the best tweet of the link!! @KieseLaymon!
5 Questions to Help You Know When to Pick Your Battles in Controversial Conversations 
@Lei_kananz maybe good to start with the UH SACNAS chapter?
@Lei_kananz I wonder if anyone @sacnas has suggestions of where funds for this can be gotten?

@Lei_kananz cool! That's important work!
@Lei_kananz nice to e-meet you. what are you studying?
So anyway, by now everyone thinks my mom is really cool, right? listen to her radio show: @sotrueradio :-D
I hope white women remember that when they get overjoyed about President Hillary Clinton. She helped her husband's anti-feminist agenda.
How do I know? Because my mom helped formulate the UN resolution that ultimately helped lead to paid parental leave policies. US opposed it.
Actually ppl complain that the US is the only country without paid parental leave. Clinton Admin delegation lead by HRC opposed UN res on it
Let's also all stop and appreciate that my low-income movement momma was lobbying the likes of HRC in the early 90s! Not like HRC listened.
@stevenstrogatz @cosmicvariance I was a much more optimistic person in 2006! I wish it had the impact this piece seems to be having.
The other side is strategizing and planning and relying on us to not be well organized.
I am not a professionalized social justice organizer but I grew up in the movement and these are basic building blocks: strategize, plan.
Malcolm X strategized with a community. MLK strategized with a community. Rosa Parks at the front of the bus? A planned strategy.
@Mad_Science_Guy I think you're a bit older than I am then haha
Injustice is infuriating but a movement cannot run on the fury of RIGHT NOW alone
Activists don't like hearing this but there is value in strategy and not just going off and making decisions w/o checking in w/ur community
HRC's people could have thought the book was a message, and it could have disrupted her lobbying strategy.
My mom was pretty unhappy with me about it. It was her fault for not telling me to leave the book behind, but I understand why.
@sondy not really something you should say publicly @docfreeride
@sondy @docfreeride I'd actually prefer if this is not discussed publicly
Once I went to the WH w/mom for a meeting with H Clinton. During the meeting, I pulled out a copy of Roots bc @ 10 that's what I was reading
@docfreeride (there is discussion which is happening by email and not on twitter)
@docfreeride my hope is that ongoing discussion about this with the AAS leadership can still be productive.
@duetosymmetry @KevinShawnHsu @vijayiyer I really loved the variation on "Hood" that they did (I think it was Hood)
@duetosymmetry @KevinShawnHsu @vijayiyer nice coincidence too bc I was thinking today that I wished I had a recording of the show we saw
@duetosymmetry yes! @KevinShawnHsu just posted to fb via @vijayiyer! I'm actually listening 2 Stephan's (the bassist) album Thwirl rite now!
@boldandworthy will look through the timeline to get caught up!!
@boldandworthy oh shit, I missed something didn't I ....
I couldn't make it to the show on Saturday night, so I'm catching up with Stephan via recording.Every1 should che... 
@FiveThirtyEight looks like there is a quick fix for Silicon Valley's problem that doesn't involve waiting for kids to grow up

@introvertology I like the idea of your service, but what if I don't have a lot of disposable income. Do you have a quick-assist package?
This evening is a Janis Joplin kind of situation
Ugh^N: non-Native ppl saying "we" when talking about historical Native Americans doing things. The word for that: APPROPRIATION. STOP IT.
@stevenstrogatz wanted to say that I appreciate that it got you thinking!
@merrdiff I saw the beginning of the 3 pt turn and decided it was too uncomfortable to watch. Feel for the driver though!
Watching a city bus make 3 pt turn in Kendall Square lulz @KevinShawnHsu
Bout to take the T home because of the most incredible traffic jam -- buses going the wrong way on a one way street 
@alexbenjm it's actually a new computer! But I actually figured it out. Thanks :-)
@girlinterruptin on perception 
@IBJIYONGI on damage to people in physics 
@ianhuston can I email you? Best email address available on website? If not my email is on mine.
I'm in a hole of coding sad and also now very late for a meeting.
@sondy @elakdawalla it's good and important that you stood up to him.
@joezuntz @ianhuston I was trying to respect that the website said not to contact him for help, but if he says it's ok, I have q's :-)
I haz pyflation sads. Does anyone have experience using pyflation? @AstroKatie?
Apparently my essay was posted to reddit, and it's mostly gotten positive comments. Hell freezing over? lol
@rafakr01 wow, really? Impressive!
If there's anything ppl want to do in the short term: start riding your TMT colleagues about the impropriety of some of TMT's fb posts
@rafakr01 heh. I think I will avoid reading the comments :-)
To the people who gave up bc of issues similar to what I wrote about: there's always time to come back.
@rafakr01 wow, it's on reddit?!?
I do hope that people younger than me don't give up because of what I wrote . . . the next generation always does better than the previous!
I did not expect it to be received the way it was. I am saddened by how many people said it spoke to their own experiences.
Many thanks to everyone who circulated, msg'd and emailed about: “Let Astro/Physics Be the Dream It Used To Be” 
@mattleifer it turned out the answer was: 
@astronomeradam drop me an email with details! contact info on website.
@bradpholden yes! thank you! not knowing was bothering the crap out of me.
@bradpholden acha! that's where it came from!
what is not homebrew but installs gcc in /usr/local/bin?
@The_Adrift like white ppl telling you you're doing it wrong, even tho they've never actually had to deal with issue under discussion lulz
@The_Adrift There are a fuckton of presumed incompetent moments for minorities who are self-advocating and mentoring
Since I've been to the NSF and elsewhere to talk about it &amp; also run a conference for and by minorities, I have some thoughts on this topic.
A lot of ppl are driven by racist and condescending ideas about URMs and how we fit in.
I think my next blog will be about what I've learned from 12 years in "the diversity racket": ppl say they care about URMs, but don't get it
@AstroKatie and of course there is much we've talked about that I didn't even get to . . . sadly.
@AstroKatie thanks for circulating it so much. I think you must be responsible for the high volume it has gotten!
@alexbenjm here is my error: 
@KYT_ThatsME no way of knowing. I have never interacted with her.
@johannateske she has a lot of good things to say in general, but we all have our faults.
@johannateske but more broadly, I don't agree with the title or angle ... Not what was pitched to me
@johannateske I had to ask for a correction about her racial identification, and she still didn't word it correctly
@alvarombedoya we should maybe discuss that more sometime -- how to protect the precious pipeline that Esperanza has started!
@alvarombedoya at the leg/$$ level we need graduate and postdoctoral fellowships for URMs in physics and astronomy (NASA has one, that's it)
@alvarombedoya Esperanza is the way. Also groups like @DIYGirls run by @LuzRivas are good to connect with!
@alvarombedoya there are minority groups that are building counterbalances to the old networks! Always happy to help with this too :-)
@alvarombedoya important to make sure your Esperanza scholars connect with mentors who can understand their experiences/support w/network
@johannateske definitely a learned lesson about how dealing with journalists is tricky sometimes
@johannateske agh, I hated that article!
“Shit White Feminists Need To Stop Doing” by @Human_Parts 
@dhjshi_shi @thenewred1 great essay! @Vasugi
@wildwonderweb @The_Adrift @Lacci yeah, ditto! I'm lucky that I don't get trolled as much as one might expect ... Knocks on wood
@thenewred1 I'm just a stickler for good sentences :-) Austen fan!
@alvarombedoya 
@wildwonderweb thanks. My husband says "yeah, it wasn't your best writing" lol
If I had known so many people were going to read my essay, I would have spent more time writing good sentences. Goddamnit lol
@sondy @Lacci @wildwonderweb @MAMelby heh. I have blocked almost no one.
@Lacci @wildwonderweb whoa you can share a block list?
@DrRubidium I made it! People I've never talked to are blocking me! Hahahaha
@wildwonderweb I guess so lol!
Just discovered I am blocked by Goldie Taylor by clicking on a tweet. I didn't even know who she was. How did she know who I am?!
@sohamist thank you!
@sohamist 
Wow, thousands of people have read my post about my experience in physics. I was not expecting that.
@boldandworthy @SoulRevision @ABC7News that's disgusting
@NGC3314 I like your formula!
The whole world should know the following: @kellecruz rocks!
@VariabilityBlog I'm not sure I have the computational skills necessary for that! But I appreciate the message and will keep it in mind :-)
@complaint_dept @arielwaldman @Nedavine read the sentence again.
@emilylurice like, tell me you've been to a professional training or did work like this as a grad student . . .
@emilylurice this one was like "yeah, nice idea, but what happens when one of them comes to you and says my family has X issue?"
Anyone can look up statistics about how minorities are doing. Knowing statistics != understanding how to help students overcome challenges.
So by the way, if you make "minorities" your broader impact target, I want to see proof you have experience working w/URM students.
Trap me in a tube traveling at 60 mph, and I will read NSF proposals.
@niais thanks :-) @ShaunKing

@upulie send me an email!
@sondy @mcnees wow, those were two very quick installs. now, ice cream.
@mcnees @sondy I suspect I will have to disentangle some things in my bash profile and install of cosmosis . . . oh well.
@JoseGarofalo_ how were your exams?
@Astrophysaxist I think @vijayiyer would get a kick out of the connex you made, and also yes, freedom to boogie and be would be more fun.
@Astrophysaxist ha! It was a Langston Hughes reference! (Let America Be the Dream It Used To Be) -- but I like the Bowie connection!
@JoseGarofalo_ someone else suggested it but my husband was like "$18?!?! and it's late and wah wah wah" sooooo

@HiCommander @sondy change is scary!!
@BaelockHolmes I definitely think #BlackandSTEM has emboldened me @BLACKandSTEM :-)
@aprilfollies of course, I had marginalized students in mind while I was writing. I want people to know it's not them. It's the system.
I don't want anyone strung up for the things that have happened to me. I just want shit like that to stop happening to me and others.
Something I didn't write about in my article today is that I carried those stories for years, feeling unsafe telling them publicly.
@dalcantonJD I thought we were friends! *Falls on banana sword*
@octopusdespot RIGHT??
@karinsandstrom if you have ideas about a banana split in manhattan, you may be forgiven
"There is a very low value placed upon Black women's psyches in this society, which is both racist and sexist." 
I may or may not be panicking about the banana split situation.
Are banana splits out of fashion? What is wrong with the world?
@AstroHyde but I speak apt :-(
@KevinShawnHsu NOPETOPUS
husband informs me: there's a chowhound thread about how hard it is to get a good banana split in manhattan. fuck this place!
@karinsandstrom new computer (a few months ago) because the old one was trying to get me to poke my eyes out
WHAT KIND OF DINER DOESN'T HAVE BANANA SPLITS ON THE MENU?
@PlanetDr I'm not seeing anything but maybe good idea to ask @kellecruz if she knows who from astropy conf to ask!
@aprilfollies hahahahaha
Does anyone know how to get pyflation to work on Yosemite? Do I need to abandon fink? Why does gcc hate me? And other questions.
@wslaton @HBO yeah, that's me on my dad's shoulders, age 4 :-)
In connection w/ @HBO airing "Tales of the Grim Sleeper" here's a clipping from a 1987 article abt my mom &amp; the case. 
In connection with my own essay, this women in astro entry is important: Sexual Harassment: Understanding the Impact 
By the way a lot of postdocs and grad students have signed the statement. Professors, you are underrepresented. :-|

@Mad_Science_Guy it's not even based on torah, and I bet most people asking don't even know that
@erinleeryan "where is your name from?" "so you're Indian?" "Which parent is Jewish?" No questions about science.
@erinleeryan this happens with some frequency
tangentially, asking someone which parent is Jewish is actually not a polite question outside of very specific contexts
@niais lulllz
And in case anyone was like "why does she feel unwelcome regularly?" BECAUSE I HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AT WORK SOMEWHAT REGULARLY
@niais someone in a different field, but I wanted to be like "whoa, do you make so many unfounded assumptions when doing science?!?!"
so my first name is not an invitation to ask me about my race, which parent is Jewish or anything else not research related during work day
Just saw someone say that the statement @niais and I wrote showed that TMT people were against racism LULZ
@BenLillie Heading over to AMNH to talk science in a bit, and the story about the meteorite was quite interesting ...


Thanks @benlillie: Mauna Kea telescope protests: Scientists need to reflect on history and culture. 
@MedinaMora @Karnythia of course they are. Now that they might actually be indicted now they want a special prosecutor. Fucking bullshit.
Murder 2, manslaughter, assault and illegal arrest. #FreddieGray
Freddie Gray's murderers are going to face charges. Will there be an indictment?

@lyndalovon saw it yesterday and was not impressed. I am told class discussion was good though.
I think it's perfectly normal to be obsessed with Beethoven's Archduke Trio.
@REasther I took lots of notes during your talk, which is a very good sign! Happy intersection!
But BIGBANG my loves, wtf is up with the white women in hanbok though?

Watching NYC MTA cops ticket a Columbia student for having the wrong bus ticket. JFC NYC tax rich people and leave bus riders alone!
@Summer_Ash thanks! I knew you had to go :-)
@erinleeryan @drannawatts @kevinschawinski wut
@drannawatts @kevinschawinski how does a thread like that even end up discussing women?!
@Summer_Ash nice talking to you!

@SonofBaldwin of course! It's how we do!
@SonofBaldwin and they adore you!!
@SonofBaldwin they were wonderful!
Looking forward to everyone using that logic to start advocating for an independent Hawai'i with reparations for stolen state funds!
Protector notes that the same logic that says King/Queen would want TMT suggests they would want Hawai'i to be independent. #TMTshutdown
So much commentary about the physics diversity community can be summed up by this tweet 
@BridgetFalck no clearly not even a tiny bit
'Structural Looting' of Black Communities Driving Protesters to Baltimore Streets - 
Another TMT fb post relies on arguments whites used to use during Jim Crow about minorities respecting democracy: 
Paper clip has some suggestions for your inner white supremacist. 
@bfwriter I'm sorry but my context for this tweet is missing?
@reneehlozek @abhirajan @DNLee5 @niais @docfreeride My problem is with what she did, not how she did it.
@docfreeride @reneehlozek @DNLee5 @niais her behavior fits in well with repeated narrative that "anti-" camp are fringe to be ignored
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @niais like "oh, so this is how people like me get treated . . . ok . . . "
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @niais yup, and I know how he feels too. I felt that way regularly in physics. Still do.
@The_Adrift man, people would rather lose people like me than lose a lot of things that are worth less than a TMT. Sad but true.
@The_Adrift thanks! a lot of people don't get that :-)
The fact that I am even thinking about this stuff is a seriously damning judgment on astro/physics. Maybe one day ppl will see that.
And if it sends "the wrong message" to my mentees, well, maybe it should.
And for the first time in a while, I have let myself consider checking out of the field because even a "survivor" like me has limits.
The discourse around TMT has really helped me see that large swath of people "concerned" about this don't actually care to understand it
And yes, a ridiculous number of the compromises involved feeling of belonging/connection wrt culture/gender/race/socioeconomic status
Supposedly in exchange for this I get "job satisfaction." hahahahahaha
Over the years, the number of times I felt like I had to compromise myself and be humiliated for physics: too many times.
I get why a student would walk out of a physics class, asking if STEM has room for them to be them. I don't feel like there's room for me.
@docfreeride @niais @DNLee5 reminds me of a place called Baltimore
@docfreeride @niais @DNLee5 at the very least don't feel responsible for combating racism while taking resources from comm subject to it
@docfreeride @niais @DNLee5 troubling that this type of messaging keeps happening from pro-TMT side, TMT has done nothing to address
"pide a Maryland tomar acción para combatir la epidemia de racismo" #freddiegray #baltimore 
@docfreeride @niais @DNLee5 also complete inability to understand that white settlers != Hawaiians
@NinaLytton the post I saw said "Professor Jelena Maricic presents a powerpoint to her Physics 272 : General Physics II"
@Mad_Science_Guy I have seen it reported as "Professor Jelena Maricic presents a powerpoint to her Physics 272 : General Physics II"
@NinaLytton No, I don't think so.
hey @18millionrising are you planning a solidarity campaign for PI folks in Hawaii? 
As @newscientist pointed out recently, there are consequences associated with "my way or the highway" attitudes in sci: losing Indig voices
This video ends with a Native Hawaiian/Kanaka Oiwi student saying "I don't want to do physics anymore"

Dear white people, if you find yourself correcting a Black person's messaging about #FreddieGray on Twitter, stop and tell yourself to STFU.

"There is power in the blood of the innocent."
Maybe they didn't mean to. But they didn't stop themselves from doing so either.
In other words, as I've been saying, the TMT benefited from a situation where colonialism has badly hindered Hawaiian community
#ProtectMaunaKea protector went up to TMT site today and spoke to security who are Hawaiian. They didn't know about the overthrow of Queen.
We must keep all eyes on #Baltimore so that there are witnesses to whatever the State comes up with next. #FreddieGray
The white supremacist tweeters using #FreddieGray hashtag are total sickos
If you come talkin at me abt #BlackLivesMatter and then have some judgments about how Hawaiians need to let you have their land, NOPE TO YOU
And I stand by everything I said this morning about #ProtectMaunaKea and #BlackLivesMatter. These issues are connected.
Are you being neutral on an issue of injustice? Why are you choosing the side of the oppressor?
Americans took US history in school &amp; got to the civil rights part &amp; judged white people who didn't do what's right.Are you one of them now?
Every1 who attended #APSApril benefited from work of the many Black staffers who worked in the hotel. Support Black Baltimore. #FreddieGray
I implore my followers who are seeing my RT's from Baltimore tonight to RT #FreddieGray protests

@niais don't worry! our mouths are like t-shirts!
@philosovashka big gap I've seen in the feminist lit too: inability to deal with how race changes everything
@philosovashka hahahaha
@philosovashka that said, I've been in the room when he was doing science. And he was doing science.
@philosovashka that was essentially constructed for him because he was a white man who was promising and family could afford resources
@philosovashka so he also makes for an unusual case because his experience is a product of a non-existent accommodations mechanism
@philosovashka anyone else wouldn't have gotten the necessary accommodation for their disability
@philosovashka I have long thought that Hawking has ended up where he is because he was economically privileged and white
@philosovashka general weird feeling about using a person who is marginalized in some way as a site for discourse -- colonial bad habit?
@philosovashka because we really can just work by ourselves. So it feels a bit like picking on him because he's got a disability.
@philosovashka I'm not sure a theorist is a good case study for dependence on academic labor of juniors like grad students
@philosovashka I guess I will have to read it, but as someone who does exactly what he does . . .
one of my favorite tracks of 2014: @wwpj - I Keep It Composed 
@The_Adrift yeah, this is totally fucking the man ......
Seriously can't believe this isn't an onion story. What the fuck is wrong with these people? Oh wait, I know. PRIVILEGED ENTITLEMENT.
@philosovashka interesting! How did disability rights advocates respond to it?
This story makes me super angry. We haven't defaced the earth enough?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! 
@Theiss9030 thanks! We actually got married in August but LOVE cherry blossoms, so we waited for spring :-)
And TMT fb account posting this article sounds a lot like "if you know what's good for you, you'll just take the money"

@Hapuna22 powerful kapu aloha
@Hapuna22 It is striking to not only hear her speak but also to hear the young man crying in the background.
Something I was thinking about a lot during the show last night: 
My question as a Black woman in astro is how can #ProtectMaunaKea protectors and #BlackLivesMatter protestors create strength 4 each other?
#BlackLivesMatter is also about this very same right, and that's another reason I stand with #ProtectMaunaKea
#ProtectMaunaKea ppl are struggling for the right of non-European origin peoples to be culturally sovereign and diverse. #BlackLivesMatter
And #BlackLivesMatter isn't just about not being killed, but also about the right to be Black, not just dark skinned whites #ProtectMaunaKea
Native Hawaiians are more likely to be incarcerated than other groups in Hawaii: 
But I do want to say I see a VERY DIRECT connection between #ProtectMaunaKea and #BlackLivesMatter
I feel like I have run out of things to say about #BlackLivesMatter and other people are doing a better job of discussing it than I could
Been trying to keep up with the TMT, racists in astro and research, so I haven't been tweeting much about #FreddieGray
It's on my mind a lot today. Richard gave me a lot of hope about the world. &lt;3

So implicitly props to the white grad students who are refusing to copy their elders by remaining silent and complicit. :-)
@astroprofhoff this one is complete with passive aggressive commentary about me but without naming names!
Dear culturally insensitive astronomer,

Stop. You're not helping. Not even your own cause. Not one bit.

Reg…
What community relies on its young people to clean up its adult messes?
Also it's almost always white grad students who speak up against the racist shit when white people do speak up. Plus @niais
Something like ~ 100 comments of people dismissing the need (racism) while also saying that the US had a problematic obsession w/racism lulz
One of my favorite "what sweet hell is this" discussions was European astros complaining abt US federal demographic data collection
Here's something an astronomer posted to their own wall about Hawaiian protectors: "they belong in the Middle Ages"
And the kind of shit that white Astros witness and say nothing about.
Someone should write a tell all about the Astronomers fb group so that people know the kind of shit white Astros say behind closed doors
Dear white people, when you witness white people being shits to POC and remain silent, the POC remember. #DecolonizeAstronomy
If white people think it's unfair that they have to clean up after other white people's racism, think about how unfair it is to exp racism.
If you're white and you're criticizing people, especially POC, for responding critically to racism, stop and ask yourself critically WTH?
Ever find yourself yelling WHY C++?!? Or is that just me? Coincidentally, that's my best language and I'm still annoyed.

@stargazer_412 @dalcantonJD @niais @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings some discussion here: 
@Enceladosaurus @dgettings @niais @docfreeride @dalcantonJD def the case that if I felt diff, I'd be offering lots of advice on effective PR
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride @dalcantonJD a horde of one
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride @dalcantonJD case in point, this public post: 
@mcnees @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais so, for the record: if racism wasn't a problem,I'd have laughed the letter off
@mcnees and using phrases like "circling the wagons" which . . . just really. @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais
@mcnees where people were discussing me without mentioning me while ignoring obvi @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais
@mcnees yes. and it was someone reposting my post, so it was a bizarre pagro @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais
@Enceladosaurus @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais didn't really back that up very well, in my opinion
@Enceladosaurus @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais fb obj was something like "twitter is not a good forum for disc"
@brianwolven @niais I nominate "Dr. Tuttle TMT Destroyer" as title for 3.5 keV
@niais because Chandra won't last forever and x-ray can't be done from the ground. For science!
@niais OK!!!!
@niais but I want an x-ray telescope D-:
@hsofia I think a lot of #agender people feel this way. (Not labeling you, just maybe something you have in common!)
@hsofia I think being cissexed has definitely affected my life, but I don't have an internal concept of being a woman beyond sex
@niais all hail the all powerful Dr. Tuttle!!!!! @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais seem far less concerned that my exp has been such that I feel compelled to speak out
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais ppl are very concerned that we are making astros look bad by speaking honestly
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais haha, now you see why I was joking about that hashtag earlier!
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais I don't expect anyone to thank us for that contribution though. :-D
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais meanwhile, just saw some protestors disc the statement and how it shows our diversity
This #BruceJennerInterview is fascinating for me as an #agender person bc I can't imagine feeling strongly identified with a gender
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais so uh, maybe I put out the statement bc I am freaking tired of it.
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings clear that besides @niais not 1 person on thread considered I had some personal exp w/racism
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings @niais &amp; ppl might also think twice about accusing a POC of having it out for 1 white person
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @dgettings but if those things were being said in public more ppl than just @niais might push back
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings ppl who thought the statement was problematic also think twitter is evil bc public
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings it is a case in point about why it is unsafe for POC like me behind closed doors.
@dalcantonJD yeah. @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings
@dalcantonJD a grp of white sci getting together in a priv space to talk abt a POC challeng racism @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings
@dalcantonJD As I said, I encouraged both here on twitter and privately ppl to have those disc @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings
@dalcantonJD I have some serious feelings about the priorities behind their assessments. @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings
@dalcantonJD this is spill over from fb- (only white) ppl are q'ing intention behind our statement @docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dgettings
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @dalcantonJD @dgettings @niais my exp is that when white ppl try to take disc abt racism private with me,I exp bullying
@cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings speaking of assuming things didn't happen because you happened to not see it happen...
@cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings people were encouraged to offer that private feedback
@cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings I don't think anyone has indicated otherwise, and here on twitter and elsewhere
@docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @dgettings treating it like an indiv incident is unfair to those who don't exp it that way
@docfreeride @cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @dgettings 1-1 private convos side step dealing with structural issues incident signaled
@cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings if we're going to get into a play by play of what has and has not been said
@cloud149 @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings actually that action was discussed here on twitter
if it's true that last night was retribution for diva-like behavior, way to take that out on the people who have made you rich #GreysAnatomy
So on to a really important issue: Shonda Rhimes is super uncreative when it comes to writing people off shows.

@josueortc when I was at Harvard talking to dining workers was also one of the rare occasions I spoke Spanish. I grok!

That said, @niais recognized my experience and experiences like mine, so she's white but totally got what needed to be said. Si se puede!
#ff @Vasugi !
And btw me and any white person in the field, as someone with 32 yrs of experience as a POC and 10+ within POC sci, I'm the expert. Sorry.
I co-authored that statement bc after 16 years, I've heard/seen/experienced so much racism in astronomy.White ppl don't get to dismiss that.
White people dismissing statement about racism that's co-authored by a POC: don't even need to explain how that looks. #DecolonizeAstronomy
if you feel threatened by a statement against racism that is broadly applicable . . . yooooooo you have work to do #DecolonizeAstronomy
@cloud149 @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings @niais I think we're all more technically proficient than that
@cloud149 @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings @niais yeah, I don't think anyone thought twitter discussion was for responding to sender
I'm a traitor. I LOVE Tidal's HiFi streaming service.
@dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride yup!
@dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride slurs are handy though because at least you know where someone stands.
@dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride and that not actively working against them means participating
@docfreeride @dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD I've had to say point blank to many scientists in the last year that they need to respect socsci
@dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride sure, I think that's a perfectly complementary piece of information.
@dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride The reality is that the status quo is racist, so essentially that's what's necessary
@dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride to me being racist is not being actively being anti-racist.
@niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings therefore "horde" is never used with racist connotation. Q E D
@niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings important for people to be able to point out that they aren't racist because [narrow parameter]
@niais @dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings have you considered coming up with a nice one sentence about what racism is?
@docfreeride @dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD but curiously some people are blaming people like us because we . . . talked about it.
@docfreeride @dgettings @niais @dalcantonJD we actually do offer that at AAS I think?!
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride @dalcantonJD my husband has also murmured a few things about astros not needing help looking bad on twitter
@niais me . . . ? I don't know? AHHHHHHHHHH
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings @niais actually one reason twitter is such a great space: POC who may not be sci can back me up
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride because it sounded a lot like "yo, POC stop speaking truth in public, it's making the white people look bad"
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride thought of that &amp; was tempted to ask if they were concerned that "the colored folk" were embarrassing whites
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings @niais I definitely think that people in positions of power/safety should be doing more of this :-)
@dalcantonJD @docfreeride @dgettings @niais a flip side to this for ppl who hold less power though: there's no accountability in private
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride I'm waiting for #notallastronomers to become a thing
@dgettings @niais @docfreeride I dunno, it sounds like some people think the astronomy community is being unfairly maligned. :-|
OK, so based on the picture in this article: the European Southern Obs is not like Las Campanas lol 
@niais champion beacher!
@niais is a champion!
@QuantumP7 can I have some funding? :-)
@QuantumP7 unfortunately very difficult to do the kind of research I think you're interested in outside of academia
@audrey_fischer @docfreeride 
@SFriedScientist I did.
@SFriedScientist I think you and I see different things when we look at those plots. Cool :-)
@SFriedScientist does that include adjunct and part time positions?
@Summer_Ash I was very aware early on that my success would be historically atypical
@Summer_Ash I don't think marginalized people typically have the same sense of guaranteed success in a straight white cisman's world
@Summer_Ash honestly the people I hear complaining about this are usually fairly privileged in some way.
@Summer_Ash well I knew I wanted to be a professor but I didn't think I was guaranteed the job, so I'm not convinced that's proxy info?
@MatSciMatt @dgettings and are completely dependent on Russia and private companies to get into space
@MatSciMatt @dgettings it's a series of trade offs but we can't design any missions with maintenance in mind right now
Who are these delusional people that start grad school thinking there are enough academic jobs for everyone? I never had that impression ...
@MatSciMatt @dgettings privatization and space ...
@MatSciMatt @dgettings I don't think that's the problem. To me it's that we haven't committed to maintaining a project the way we did Hubble
Excellent #Pilates duet with my husband on the Cadillac today at Upward Spiral Studio!
@thegemmadiaries usually the bigger companies are better and it's the small ones you have to worry about. Sigh.
[Did someone say K-Pop thread?] 
hey @SenWarren, what are you going to do about Senate cooks making poverty wages while serving you food?
"The struggle against the neocolonial exploitation of Hawai’i &amp; Kanaka Maoli is ongoing" 
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @elakdawalla finally storifyed something! 
Someone asked me to storify my tweets about racism in astro from the other night, so here they are: 
@IBJIYONGI You've been quoted in my #Storify story "Some Comments on Anti-Native&amp;POC Racism in Astronomy" 
Added names to Short statement about the use of racist language in astronomy and physics! 
Adding names to the anti-racist statement right now, and you folks who filled out the google form put some hilarious answers in thoughts box
@jegpeek @niais and SMITHSONIAN WE ARE COOOL lulz I guess?
@jegpeek @niais I thought about that and actually thought it was weird he mentioned GMT involvement
@jegpeek @niais oh I see what you mean. Yeah, good point.
@jegpeek @niais my guess is he was given a word count
@niais @docfreeride no Dr. and no explanation of what postdoc was. Then AAS women commented the hell out of how incorrect article was lol
@niais @docfreeride and some jackass wrote a rude ass post referring to me as "local postdoc Chanda Prescod-Weinstein"
@niais @docfreeride I wrote a letter to AAS women about how Caroline Herschel was portrayed in a Smithsonian exhibit
@niais @docfreeride this is actually my second round getting mentioned on their site, the last time was completely disrespectful
So uh, where is the #AAPI press/commentariat on the #ProtectMaunaKea story? I feel like I've been hearing crickets ......
@Pundit_AcadEMIC if you happen across any covering science please ping me? :-)
@niais our statement is one of the first links! And @docfreeride's storify is too! @SmithsonianNMAI's Doug Herman did a great job!

"when u see the poss of “progress” in more connected way u see that we are actually the 1s looking 2 the future." 
@dgettings @runningnekkid and not just Hawaiians but also other scientists that I didn't know as well as I do now. :-)
@dgettings @runningnekkid I get random people sending me aloha on twitter, fb, and instagram and starting meaningful conversations
@dgettings @runningnekkid as haggard as my commentary often sounds, for me personally, friendship will be a major legacy.
@BeCurieus @runningnekkid 
@BeCurieus @runningnekkid there are some helpful resources here: 
Yo @runningnekkid dropped a fantastic highly accessible twitter lesson about Hawaiian history on her twitter feed, GO READ IT!!! #MaunaKea
@runningnekkid whoops, forgot to say thank you! Mahalo!
@runningnekkid you are of course also welcome to jump into any of my threads as you feel appropriate whenever you happen on one
@runningnekkid okay, I will keep that in mind. I will try to be responsible and not send people just looking to argue/be unproductive.
@dgettings @erinleeryan the short lifespan is kind of shocking given comparisons to Hubble
@dgettings @erinleeryan yeah good point, I didn't think about that.
Bc I am a third party on some level, and I'm sure protectors can answer in ways I wouldn't think to #ProtectMaunaKea #aoleTMT #TMTshutdown
this is mostly for me to tag people when someone who is being reasonable asks a question #ProtectMaunaKea #aoleTMT #TMTshutdown
Hey #ProtectMaunaKea #aoleTMT #TMTshutdown folks, any volunteers to answer questions about what they see wrong with TMT narrative?
Chuckling to myself about people treating tweets like they are a journal article. I don't actually have to give you a bibliography!
@erinleeryan @dgettings telescopes have families and lives, right @niais ?
@erinleeryan @dgettings ever have the feeling Spitzer gets treated like the ugly step-child?
@dgettings yeah, they should stop covering up how much not having a space program hurts us!
@prenerk EPIC!
@prenerk yes, I am ALL CAPS SUPER STOKED ABOUT THE SCIENCE! Witnessing galaxy birth is going to be epic.
by the way, James Webb did a lot for NASA but was also a vicious homophobic prick, so we should probably change the name of the telescope
A super excellent Q&amp;A about the next major space telescope, James Webb Space Telescope: 
&amp; if anyone ever tells me that they've negotiated things with Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson so it's all good, I'm going to be so fucking mad
slavery is another thing that has impacted my family, &amp; it sucks that the Americas still have to redress the fall out, but it's unavoidable
For reasons totally unrelated to science, I wish colonialism had never happened. But it would also help ease conflict in astronomy too . . .
@niais @emilylurice will be transferring names from google doc in the evening
@niais instead what we've got is "you're wrong!" Which is a proxy for "I'm not sure what's going on!" 90% of the time
@niais if people learned to say, "can you help me understand how the info I know relates to what you've said? I'm confused!"
@niais it's such a huge issue, right? Puns aside, this could be a game changer for culture of the field.
I wish male physicists and astronomers would tell their colleagues "stop turning every discussion into a dick measuring contest" @niais
I am allergic to people with the attitude that I owe them a proof or explanation for anything. Are you paying me for my time? No? Well then.
Happy to direct people to more information, but for the n+1th time I'm not here to debate you and how I respond will depend on your approach
@steinly0 ok, done here. You're not interested in information.
@steinly0 "are you sure you didn't make Y up?" is just rude.
@steinly0 here is a good scientific approach: "I heard X but you say Y. Why doesn't X make sense in your view?"
@steinly0 look you can ask questions about the data or about the scientist. One yields info about the data.
@steinly0 if there is a piece of information you are unsure about you can tweet to the hashtag #ProtectMaunaKea and protestors might answer
@steinly0 you didn't ask about the information, you asked about my methods which doesn't answer your questions.
@steinly0 I am puzzled why you are questioning my confidence that I know something.
@steinly0 look up who appointed the "outsiders" who advised them
@steinly0 and also this is completely unrelated to building in a conservation district. So won't be replying to this thread anymore.
@steinly0 maybe but ... Not identical to Mauna Kea for reasons obvious to anyone who has read about why MK matters
@steinly0 a building becoming a landmark is not the same situation for obvious reasons
Sad week for k-pop fans. We are finding out that one our most beloved labels @SMentertainmnt abuses its stars. Boycotting their music :-(
@GrumpyKelson @SCTrager @dalcantonJD @Adam_Hefty I don't remember my own life. I left fall 2006. Arrived 03. So unionization in 2000?
@GrumpyKelson @SCTrager @dalcantonJD I arrived in fall of 2006. @Adam_Hefty and I helped form reform movement that's in charge now!
@SCTrager @GrumpyKelson @dalcantonJD look @Adam_Hefty it's our pre-2865 ancestors!
@GrumpyKelson @SCTrager @dalcantonJD I want to say 2003? But maybe earlier.
@GrumpyKelson @SCTrager @dalcantonJD maybe time to form an astro-uaw 2865 alumni club for ... Beer?
@SCTrager @GrumpyKelson @dalcantonJD OMG you guys are like my Union ancestors!
@GrumpyKelson @SCTrager @dalcantonJD me becoming a head steward merited a meeting about "concerns" :-)
@GrumpyKelson @SCTrager @dalcantonJD I learned quantum field theory! The astronomy department, it turns out, wasn't super happy about that.
@brianwolven @niais @dalcantonJD oddly these are aspects of space telescopes that I've been paid to think about haha
@gregorycendana @KevinShawnHsu thanks! Asian American solidarity with Pacific Islanders could make a huge difference!
@niais @dalcantonJD especially with no space program ...
Thoughts are with #Chile tonight as they experience a massive volcanic eruption.
@nhcody yup, posted that a few hours ago!
@OxyAstro yeah, that sucks. But this is more like putting it inside the Grand Canyon. (Just to be fair to how people in Hawaii feel)

@dgettings @erinleeryan WHAT? NO
I will probably stop (for the night) adding people's names to the statement soon. So patience please and email names to me: chanda@mit.edu
@UrbanAstroNYC thanks :-)
Just became very excited that I understood a fb status because I know a couple of Hawaiian words lol
@mayainamura This is actually my own personal objection: you can't really rebuild a mountain.
mentioning that white people are engaging in white supremacy is not racist, sorry.
thank heaven for the mute button (x2)
It's okay to make mistakes! But what you do when someone says you might have made one is what's important.
@The_Adrift but now they have a choice :-) which pill will they take?
@The_Adrift and I think a lot of people who participated in TMT didn't realize the system they were a part of (maybe should have)
@The_Adrift definitely a major reason I've thought about it so much. the protectors are breaking through the colonial matrix.
But also seriously, since when is building an 18 story building in a conservation district a thing? Would that happen in Yosemite?
By only negotiating with colonial entities, TMT made a decision that enabled profiting from colonial power dynamics
@jkgoya also, negotiating with colonial entities usually pisses off the people who are not down with the colonialism, lol
Governor Ige and his gov't speaks for a version of Hawaii that accepts US domination. Think outside of The Matrix if you want to understand.
and Hawaii is still-colonial, hasn't even made it to post-colonial yet
the reality is that post-colonial spaces are often messy, and that is often not helped by outsiders with their own agendas
feel a bit like the plot of The Matrix is playing out 4 real. The machine is like "which is the leader? who can I assign the most value to?"
@jkgoya hard to listen when people are talking down to you instead of discussing with you, you know?
@jkgoya I am sure others would say I am mischaracterizing, but I think negotiations had an entitled tone that people picked up on
Hopefully in the process, there will be less misinformation about the technical value of TMT floating around. (you're welcome guys)
It helps when people know you respect their autonomy, self-determination and intellect, I think.
And by that I mean I didn't come into the discussion saying "we're doing this, by the way, here's what we're doing, hope you like it."
Had a great discussion today where I explained some of the science and equipment to protestors. Seems no one bothered to do that nicely.
@alyssakeiko yeah, that stuff actually doesn't get to me. when physicists use soft racism, then I get upset
@dgettings I tried but none of the UCs wanted me!
thank heavens for the mute button
@mcnees 
I think someone just tweeted at me the equivalent of "go back to wherever you came from" -- strong work white supremacist
@DrDa5id you too? :-)
@Tontonis Dr.?
@kellecruz that's a signature, right? :-)
@DrMRFrancis @DNLee5 @niais fuck that shit, you know?
@erinleeryan @niais that's a decent excuse!
@merrdiff @niais @sondy oh, thanks!
@DrMRFrancis @DNLee5 @niais physicists are physicists!
I can't tell y'all how weird 2day has been (like actually can't) but I will say that all the anti-racist solidarity is making a nice 3rd act
@DNLee5 @niais for now we are just doing astro/phys folks, but maybe we need a longer one about stem?
@Enceladosaurus @niais I will add your name? lots of grad students already.
@Enceladosaurus @niais we're not professors! :-)
@Enceladosaurus @niais anyone in the community can sign, but I understand vulnerable as well
@MarsMaven @dgettings cool! thanks!
@erinleeryan @niais haha, I was just waiting for this tweet :-P
@ltbikes @niais thanks!!
@docfreeride @dgettings hmm, yeah. Maybe when we expand?
@5cloudsdancing yes! :-)
@docfreeride @dgettings haha fair enough
@niais well if (my friend) Meng Su can be PI on a telescope, find the Fermi bubble and also think about theory, we can too?!
@dalcantonJD all on GR and QFT/Standard model! I suddenly feel very boring.
@dalcantonJD I think almost everything I do can be traced to one course at MIT, 3 at Santa Cruz and 1 at Perimeter, ha
@niais does our statement represent the first successful collaboration of a telescope instrumentalist with a particle theorist?
@dalcantonJD (feel like I should have been forced to learn this at some point, but I also think all astronomers should take GR)
@steinly0 @dalcantonJD my understanding is SCOTUS gutted anything genuinely useful to Hawaiians
@stephtdouglas @niais done! thanks!
@dalcantonJD thank you! I will now go explain it to someone so that I don't forget it.
@dalcantonJD ahhhh, thank you :-)
@dalcantonJD ok, then I am even more confused than I thought. WHy is ground better? (SUPER SORRY)
@AgentPoiznAloha for this one thing we want to show that the astro/phys community also is pushing back, in solidarity
@dalcantonJD sorry to ask the same q twice maybe, but why are spectra better from the ground?
@AgentPoiznAloha are you a member of the astro/phys community?
@astrophysically cool! thanks dr. tan!
@astrophysically forgive my not knowing, predoc, postdoc or faculty?
@dalcantonJD although worth noting that the US formally apologized for that (Clinton), but SCOTUS ruled apology was not legally admissible
@dalcantonJD lawyer in the fam pointed out on fb that of course the US law has no mechanism for redressing colonalism/annexation concerns
@ProtectMaunaKea feel free to circulate the link, it is already public
@ProtectMaunaKea @BabesAgainstGMO We are considering this a statement from members of the astro and physics communities.Sorry for confusion!
@ProtectMaunaKea I think we are going to try to focus on getting ppl from astro/physics to sign it, to show sci stand behind this
@QuantumP7 @sondy @niais self-identified membership in astro/physics community
@sethzenz ok hehe sorry about the faux promotion :-)
@dgettings I'm just adding names in the order that they arrive :-) So far only men have signed besides the original two!
@sethzenz done! thanks!
@mayainamura hmmm @niais and I did not think through this possibility. will discuss!
@MichaelJewell78 done!
@richardselby 
Anyone interested in adding their name to the statement, just let me know.
@GrumpyKelson @augustmuench @sethzenz of interest
@ProtectMaunaKea
@docfreeride @DNLee5 @AGVwrites @KevinShawnHsu @dgettings @BenLillie @KeoluFox @SiouxperNova @JedidahIslerPhD @BlackPhysicists #blackandstem
@niais and I have just put out “A statement about the use of racist language in astro/physics.” 
@dgettings @augustmuench @jradavenport ahahahahahaha
@merrdiff @jradavenport @augustmuench @TheAstronomist @PeterYoachim and we don't have to be world view supremacists to do western science
@merrdiff @jradavenport @augustmuench @TheAstronomist @PeterYoachim dominant epistemology of science basis one but not only epistemology
@merrdiff @jradavenport @augustmuench @TheAstronomist @PeterYoachim not to mention racialized undertone of natives vs dominant epistemology
@dgettings @augustmuench @jradavenport his past remarks about indigenous cultures make me think no, I'd rather not hear it hahaha

I love learning languages, so all the Hawaiian is a wonderful gift for my nerd brain :-)
I feel especially thankful to the people who have started me on the path to understanding Pono. Mahalo!
I appreciate so much the Hawaiians who have talked to me these last few weeks, both in English and Hawaiian. I have learned a lot!
@kahiwal1 mahalo a nui for being willing to do some education :-) @docfreeride @DNLee5 @niais
@kahiwal1 do you happen to know if majority of signatures were fro. Hawaii? @docfreeride @DNLee5 @niais
@docfreeride @DNLee5 @niais 'aina is land and kupuna is family
@kahiwal1 @docfreeride @DNLee5 @niais I have been using it a lot but guess that people think it is a typo for protestor
@kahiwal1 I wonder if you would be willing to say more about what "protector" means, for people unfamiliar @docfreeride @DNLee5 @niais
at least we still have this: New species of frog found in Costa Rica looks just like Kermit 
@barrygoldman1 and yeah, scientists can be kind of religious about their science and not very self-aware about it
@barrygoldman1 
I'm with @GovernorOMalley against "Fast Track" on the #TPP. Join us. 
@barrygoldman1 you mean only stuff I am posting against? TMT fb page has lots of "for" stuff
And I am going to be proud to support her campaign to become Congresswoman @LucyFlores!
@LucyFlores gives me hope for a future where people from ghettos like my home of East LA matter as much as people from Beverly Hills.
AWWWWWWW YEAH! @LucyFlores is running for Congress!!!!!! SI SE PUEDE!
@briancribb cute!
@AmyMarshSexDr @docfreeride mahalo a nui for this overview, I haven't had time to condense and summarize what I have learned
@runningnekkid mahalo nui for including me and being encouraging
I am now atheistically imploring Secular Jesus. HALP
@AmyMarshSexDr @docfreeride oh I meant about annexation. Quibbling about Us code technicalities.
@kara_woo so actually would have been good to pay attention and say "want someone who doesn't think like this"
@kara_woo interesting actually because they are selecting the replacement for the original letter sender's last big job
@AmyMarshSexDr @docfreeride saw an astronomer quibble about the illegal aspect, and I think he was wrong and also missing the point
@kara_woo "I was in a rush and forgot to censor my colleague's racism"
@docfreeride @DNLee5 @niais here is Filippenko's apology posted  
@Koreaboo no lie, this letter made me cry and hope that fans will push companies to treat our idols with respect
@niais @PlanetDr I tried to storify this morning and got overwhelmed. I am irrationally afraid of storify.
@niais I jest, this is excellent, I want to RT more times
@niais please type faster
This does not have to be our fate. We can start making different choices right now, today. #DecolonizeAstronomy 
change is always possible. We are not married to our mistakes We can make different choices. 
They say history is written by the victors and that has been true about Hawaii too.
How many people know that most histories of Hawaii annexation used only English-language source materials which make up &lt;10% of available?
@invertenerd the dissertation has an excellent bibliography for history of annexation that uses non-English language documents
@invertenerd also if you have access to proquest there is a dissertation by joseph Salazar about colonialism and astronomy on Mauna a wakea
@invertenerd lots of good stuff at 
@dgettings @mandaYoho ding ding ding ding ding
@DNLee5 @mandaYoho @dgettings maybe the back of "Pono science is possible!" @KeoluFox

I have priorities that are NOT your Science
#DecolonizeSTEM
@Summer_Ash gotta say that @lada90 and @SiouxperNova and I agreed to be a horde of POC opposed to colonialism in science. Not offended.
Someone just told me #hordesofastronomers is a hashtag lol
@steinly0 declaring that they are not does not magically erase the problem
@steinly0 and questions about legitimacy of US presence in Hawaii are real
@steinly0 actually not obvious if the elected government is not agreed on as legitimate by everyone
@dgettings @mandaYoho a bit narcissistic eh?
@mandaYoho @dgettings "I have priorities that are not your astronomy" doesn't seem to be computing at all
@dgettings @mandaYoho how can we make them agree with us? Is a question I keep getting
#blackandstem there is a biochemistry faculty opening at University of San Diego 
@mandaYoho @dgettings I wondered if they were hoping to prove a majority? That's not going well if that's the plan
@mandaYoho @dgettings oh sorry! Should have asked :-)
@mandaYoho @dgettings some want more, like removal of others
@mandaYoho @dgettings I think that's the point for many protestors
@mandaYoho @dgettings well the one with 50k is to not build telescope
TMT negotiated with the Hawaiians they thought they had to negotiate with. Wildly different from democracy.
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @bucksci @dgettings @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy that's very respectful! "Deal with it colonial losers!"
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @bucksci @dgettings @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy in sum, Native self-determ don't matter bc colonialism made them minority
@DNLee5 @docfreeride @bucksci @dgettings @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy You know who else was a minority agitator? MLK.
Thank goodness I am trained as a particle theorist too.
@DNLee5 @dgettings @docfreeride @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy scientists keep saying "I'm pro-TMT bc I am for truth" and then I see dishonesty
@DNLee5 @dgettings @docfreeride @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy also "concerns about colonialism" I guess is too big of a phrase for him?
@DNLee5 @dgettings @docfreeride @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy also weird is the lecture about democracy. when did they vote on TMT? never.
@bucksci @docfreeride @dgettings @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy this is all wildly abusive of the undergrads, in my opinion
@bucksci @docfreeride @dgettings @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy I saw one of the emails for help that went out and it was sad
@bucksci @docfreeride @dgettings @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy yes, attacking the POC undergrads for getting help is fucking bullshit
@dgettings @docfreeride @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy I mean maybe they don't know that because they haven't bothered to get to know any
@dgettings @docfreeride @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy and on the subject of Hawaii almost certainly better educated.
@dgettings @docfreeride @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy and also that much of the protest leadership is just as well educated as them
@docfreeride @DNLee5 @dgettings @mlg3k @robminchin @sondy not as far as I know.
Not "I apologize for being inflammatory." Inflammatory is not a structural system designed to keep us as second class citizens. RACISM IS.
So when we say "racism" you say "I apologize for racism."
In fact, being born POC means that by age 10-15, you have the equiv of multiple PhDs in recognizing racism. We are better at this than you.
we actually don't need a PhD and/or a lifetime of exp'ing racism to figure out when you are being disingenuous. but many of us have both.
yes, dear white people, we can tell when you are not apologizing to us. your POC undergrads can tell when you don't care about them too.
@docfreeride @dgettings @mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy he did request the email be forwarded to anyone who might have seen the original
we people of color actually have brains! SHOCK
Dear white people, if your faux apology for racism intended to soften the blow on a fellow white person *we people of color can tell*
Dear white people, if you participated in racism here is how you apologize: "sorry I participated in racism." EASY!
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy way to let students of color who were DEEPLY upset know that they matter less than Sandy. <POUTING FACE>
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy because not referring to Sandy's words as racist was more important issue of respect than impact on POC
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy like, now I think people writing and ok'ing these emails are just being disingenuous
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy it's so easy it took me &lt;15 seconds to tweet it!
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy "sorry something racist was sent over the department email list."
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy also, the word everyone was looking for and avoided was "racism." "Sorry I said something racist."
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy and it displays a real inability/unwillingness to grasp the issues at play.
@mlg3k @DNLee5 @robminchin @sondy I read the apologies that were circulated. The lecture about democracy is condescending
@steinly0 @docfreeride I've known the problems since 2001. I was 19 and an undergrad in 2001. So ... Yeah that's a bad excuse. #theoristtoo
@5cloudsdancing my fb fanpage?
@tomr_stargazer thanks for helping!!
I think maybe it's time to ask some people "are you anti-POC unless they assimilate to some idea of whiteness?"
I also thank plants and animals that died before I eat them. Must be anti-science!
Faith practices that are mostly white people &gt;&gt;&gt; faith practices that are mostly not white people. Got it, racist scientists!
Oh wait, no one ever accuses Jews of being anti-science when we want our traditions and spaces to be respected.
I also light Shabbat candles every Friday evening. Must be anti-science!
I just smudged myself with sage. It's something I grew up doing bc of time spent in L.A. Lakota community. I must be anti-science!
@BritePauchet thanks :-)
@DNLee5 ahahahahhaha
In case you didn't get it, that's MLK giving you the side eye about poor deployment of science.
@Lr1Lr1 @elakdawalla thanks :-)
@AstroKatie members of collab have told them they will have to do better than that

In summary 
@elakdawalla I hope one day to have the mental freedom to come up with some science that will be equally popular :-)
@roseveleth thanks :-)
Thanks to all the Astros who have been supportive (and disproportionately female)! Everyone else: they are shouldering too much. Help them.
@elakdawalla thanks for being so supportive!
Proud of my mom Margaret Prescod for staying on LAPD until they caught the Grim Sleeper and agree w/ @BitchMedia she deserves a documentary
@KevinShawnHsu yeah my mom is pretty boss
“We don’t mean nothing to them. It’s Black women. I’m a Black woman. Who gives a fuck about me?” 
For @noduart: the blue lady in dusk light 
Shame.
But my grandma did not suffer greatly so that I could ally myself with people who looked down on folks like her, so shame on you astro comm.
Doesn't matter if that Bible got her through colonialism, not having enough to eat, the trauma of leaving home on her birthday bc science!
And it is beyond clear that some scientists would bulldoze my grandmother's altar and her bible if it suited their spectroscopy needs.
I have an altar to my grandmother and her bible on my mantle. I'm an atheist. But I respect my islander family's spiritual traditions.
Be a good citizen, not just for yourself and your science but for the community which includes Native scientists and non-scientists
Learn about the limits on science's internalist epistemology and if you're a scientist who doesn't know about that, look it up
Learn about colonial astronomy and its connection with slavery.
Learn the history of protests -span decades. Learn the real story about annexation. Learn about the Hawaiian Renaissance. Learn about Pono.
So please prove me wrong: don't be satisfied by an apology from Faber and Filippenko. Do uplift Native voices. Q your internalized racism.
Where is your conscience? Where? We are on their land. We owe Native students more than we can pay.
I hear stories of Native people afraid to speak out. Is this a community we want? A community of fear?
And I am ashamed to be part of a community that would make someone so precious feel pushed out. That is deeply shameful.
Who will take responsibility for that, pro-TMT astronomy community? Because I haven't seen one person take responsibility and it's sick.
when a barrier breaking Native American woman keeps tweeting that astro is making her q whether there is a place for her WE HAVE FUCKED UP.
#NATIVELIVESMATTER means acknowledging Native culture and identity matters. That is truth. Truth that science cannot undo or hide.
I hope that the USA astro/physics community redeems itself. We are on stolen land. #NATIVELIVESMATTER and that's truer than Newton's laws.
in the last week I have seen so many so called diversify advocates do exactly that. And they should be ashamed and I feel ill they aren't.
Ppl might think I said unpleasant things but I didn't use my pos of power to talk down to traditionally disempowered and disenfranchised ppl
In over a decade of working against discrimination in astro/physics, I have never been so disappointed in this community than I am now.
And more broadly people should take responsibility for helping to foster a hostile field with their condescending racism.
There should be apologies. First and foremost to all the Native and Indigenous people who have been indirect victims of astro arrogance.
Well, I think I've said enough about racism and the TMT. people will hear it or not. I haven't seen anyone apologize for things they did.

Next Monday night, if you're in LA you can meet my mom :-) 
@govertschilling @phi48 and I have serious concerns about the way TMT arranged things, given accusations of misuse of opposing research
@govertschilling @phi48 I'm a theoretical cosmologist who supports the right of Native Hawaiians to determine what happens to their homeland
@govertschilling @phi48 indefinite pause right now
@govertschilling @phi48 issue has been building momentum for decades but finally enough people to meet an attention threshold
@niais jabref
@robminchin @sondy @mlg3k "badly phrased"
Must read for #DecolonizeAstronomy #diversitySTEM #blackandstem  advocates 
@sondy @mlg3k where?
@kejames @SiouxperNova the more significant damage is going to be behind closed doors: jobs and money will be more scarce
@kejames @SiouxperNova thanks :-)
@kejames @SiouxperNova also had random people try to start in with me on Twitter, even after I said no thanks
@lada90 @SiouxperNova horde of 3!
@kejames @SiouxperNova I guess I'm an underinformed horde of 1?
@kejames @SiouxperNova baseless accusations toward me about how long I've known about these issues and whether I understand what's going on
@kejames @SiouxperNova very different kinds, but yes
@SiouxperNova I just love Hubble anyway &lt;3
@SiouxperNova that's not ok. For obvious reasons. Less obvious: the roots of dominant sci epistemology are not European. We've been lied to.
@mlg3k @sondy would be good to address this post too: 
@SiouxperNova I am grateful for the telescopes we have :-)
@SiouxperNova I suspect you and I have more experience than some other people with appreciating what you already have ...
@SiouxperNova pono astronomy is possible!
@lada90 people do seem to be forgetting that there are indigenous scientists who are being harmed by this shit
@govertschilling @phi48 en veel andere dingen
@govertschilling @phi48 sorry mijn Nederlands is niet zo goed over dit te praten ... Er zijn disputen over het proces het land te krijgen
@GrumpyKelson nobody loves you!
@BeCurieus this would be #14
@BeCurieus 
@BeCurieus sometimes it's good to be grateful for all of the plenty in one's life, I think.
@BeCurieus not at all to sound rude, but i think that question is "do you think we can somehow get ppl ok with illegal settlements?"
@BeCurieus yeah, stick to the original agreement of no more than 11 telescopes. That's already including ones built without proper permits.
someone want to call me anti-astro now? I work in the field and have two degrees in astro. That email was anti-POC.
talking openly about the email does not harm astro. Racism harms astro.
@thetrudz @BritniDWrites I guess we will see what was achieved
@BritniDWrites @thetrudz TNR was strategically awful place for that biz
@BritniDWrites @thetrudz no but we are strategic about what we do and where we do it
@BritniDWrites @thetrudz I was at Harvard when West abandoned students who came there for him so it's not like I like him lol
@BritniDWrites @thetrudz and that is how we will read it. Not how their majority white readers will necessarily see it
@thetrudz @BritniDWrites deleted tweet so you won't get retweet pings, not to hide misstep
@thetrudz @BritniDWrites respect! Sorry I missed that. I was personally affected which is why I mentioned it.
@BritniDWrites @thetrudz looks like the same getup with a new editorial staff to me
@BritniDWrites @thetrudz same brand though. New ideas might mean ... Acknowledging past problems with only attacking Black studies
@thetrudz @BritniDWrites to me interesting question is why did TNR publish it? Their history with Black studies is not pretty.
@kejames that came from one of the horrid hordes! So anti-science!! /sarcasm
@tunglere "against" is one translation. Wehewehe online dictionary is a great resource
Someone shared a picture with me of someone Hawaiian students wearing shirts that said "PONO SCIENCE IS POSSIBLE." Let's do it!!!!!
@steinly0 thanks for the references!
@steinly0 @te_pickering @SCTrager tangentially: my experience at Magellan was so different from what is described for ESO!
@steinly0 @te_pickering @SCTrager this part I knew about, is there discussion about what ppl should do in response? Apologize? Reparations?

@SCTrager @te_pickering @steinly0 @nsuntzeff trying to find more info on this!
@te_pickering @steinly0 @SCTrager although in case of Hawaiians, they have been steadily building. Just first time astro can't ignore
@te_pickering @steinly0 @SCTrager definitely why I am asking about it
@SCTrager @drannawatts and @SiouxperNova speaks German so maybe she can be recruited for a post doc in a few years with "it's close!"
@sdssurveys but how do they work?!
LAT article about Mauna Kea upset from 2001. Know your history. 
Narrative that there was no "real" obj to telescopes on Mauna Kea must be seen in light of email. Are Hawaiians ppl? Maybe not to everyone.
@steinly0 @SCTrager that's definitely true! But I think people are now at peace about it. Or no?
@SCTrager the Netherlands is the only place in the world besides Barbados where I have a lot of family in one place, so that's a plus for me
@SCTrager ooh I love Leiden. Lovely bike paths by the university and great working space. Good to know. Thank you :-)
@SCTrager if I'm on the market again in fall, maybe we can discuss who I should talk to
@SCTrager yeah I actually almost did, but NL is string theory heavy so I didn't find a place where I thought I'd fit
@SCTrager every year when we visit my husband is like "can't you get a job that would let us live in Rotterdam? PLEASE??"
@SCTrager it sounds pretty exciting :-) I would love a job in the Netherlands!
So by the way I AM SUPER STOKED ABOUT THE E-ELT AND GMT!!! And so are the people of Chile from what I know :-) why not join them?
@Lacci I learned from the Internet in 2001 and I'm a theorist so ... But then again, I was not delusional about legacy of colonialism lol
@Lacci Those of us whose ancestors were devastated by colonialism must stand with those who are protecting the next 7 generations from it.
Be sad about it. That's totally understandable. But the saddest part is what Hawaiians have been through since 1893. Not losing a telescope.
Yes, it means some people aren't going to get what they want. But we were getting what we want for the wrong reasons. Profiting from theft.
they have gathered their strength/are fighting back against colonial astronomy. Golden age of getting what we want at their expense is over.
The entire astro comm has to accept that regardless of what you've been lead to believe, ppl have been objecting to telescopes for decades
Even if Mauna Kea were a traditional garbage dump, capitalizing on colonialism through shady processes is obscene.

@sondy @mlg3k or "why don't they have better priorities?" ppl say things like this about Black ppl &amp; isn't magically better about Hawaiians.
@ErgoOne actually not the primary objection, contrary to what you may have heard. I'm sure any of my Hawaiian followers will back that up.
@ErgoOne yeah as a cosmologist I have dispute about the science capacity of E-ELT or GMT, which face no land troubles.
It should say something that I'm not actually surprised someone was thinking this about Hawaiian protectors.
@mlg3k @sondy fantastic! I know you're not the only one, have heard privately from another
@sondy @mlg3k and ppl have been sounding the alarm about racist structures in the field for decades
@sondy @mlg3k stuff like this just doesn't happen in a vacuum
@sondy @mlg3k I hope ppl also take the time to ask what this implies about thinking that went into negotiations
@ErgoOne most of the pro statements I have seen have been tinged with condescension that is a soft racism.
@dgettings @kejames @mayainamura it's not "native Hawaiians can't be astros" but "natives can't be astros unless they share my colonialism"
@dgettings @kejames @mayainamura must address fact that dearth of POC in field is not coincidence. Racist ideas are real.
@Mad_Science_Guy @BenLillie @mcnees related: the documentary about why is airing on HBO Monday night "Tales of the Grim Sleeper"
@Mad_Science_Guy @BenLillie @mcnees true story: LAPD chief once said "get prescod off my back" about my mom. Gotta catch up w/her
@Mad_Science_Guy @BenLillie @mcnees I am looking into one woman horde qualification and licensing
@sondy @mlg3k the community can come out stronger on the other end
@sondy @mlg3k I think this is a moment for comm to do some soul searching about how someone in a position of leadership can think this way
@kejames @mayainamura Faber is a barrier breaker for women in the field and one of the biggest names on the planet. This sucks.
@SiouxperNova as long as I am in astro/physics and you want a place in it, there will be room for you.
@BenLillie @mcnees yes indeed it is.
If this is how ppl involved with TMT think about Hawaiians opposed to the project, did TMT negotiate respectfully in good faith? Now a Q.
As a reminder, participating in soft racism (noblesse oblige) enables hard racism (lying native hordes). Don't be part of the problem.
@Summer_Ash @BenLillie I heard it got circulated in other departments as well
Astro S Faber apparently sent an email which A Filippenko cosigned referring to "a horde of Hawaiians who are lying" 
The email as forwarded is on imgur: 
Bought this for a bff as a "congrats on quitting medicine for the culinary world" gift. I'm pretty pleased w/myself: 
Am now going to dream of a world where I can just think about K-pop and not stupid racism.
So I'm not suggesting that it is ok to engage in violent threats or racism from either side. There should be repercussions for that.
And we will all work together to ensure that people junior to us don't suffer repercussions for expressing their conscience respectfully
If astro are serious about equity, whether they are pro- or anti-TMT they will let grad students know it is okay to speak their mind.
@dgettings of course TMT people have denied that this is how it happened.
@supermemo64 And there are many people who are concerned, so it's not just me. Your friend is not alone.
@ErgoOne @kejames Oh I'm Black, so I definitely did! And fam from Barbados, so I sub Barbados when people say Hawai'i. It's ugly.
@supermemo64 that is absolutely unacceptable.
@supermemo64 if it seems appropriate, please feel free to let your friend know s/z/he may contact me for a sounding board etc
@dgettings I've heard things like the impact report actually included stuff that was from people opposed and taken out of context
@dgettings I hadn't thought about that aspect of it. But it lines up with what I've heard from protestors.
@dgettings I think you're right. It raises VERY serious questions about whether consultation was done respectfully and in good faith.
@ErgoOne @kejames key phrase cut and pasted: "attacked by a horde
of native Hawaiians who are lying"
@kejames @ErgoOne But I'm sure someone will get a hold of it
@kejames @ErgoOne Since I wasn't an original recipient it's not my place to post it because I can't guarantee nothing is falsified
@kejames people have multiple levels of concern about how racist it is
People in my family also have spiritual beliefs that are non-Christian in origin. Does that make them less than an astronomer?
And when people make comments about "the protestors" it is not lost on me that you mean people like members of my family.
If Barbados had a mountain and no rainy season, this could be happening to the colony my family is now from.
*We have a cultural problem.* WORRY ABOUT THAT
If you q'd the protestors motives and history or said that you understood what their priorities should be better than them, you helped
if you said something abt how the protestors "just don't understand" and "need education" and "are anti-science" you helped make this happen
That condescension is also racist. And it gives energy to people who want to say something more virulent.
I am personally sick of the subtle and not so subtle condescension that I have seen in so many (mostly white) astronomers comments about TMT
And we don't deal with cultural problems by worrying more about how they make us look than about what they are doing to people in community
Bc if any of our leadership feel comfortable saying these things to large groups of people, it signals a cultural problem
Why should we talk about the email? Because it came from a community leader who felt comfortable saying it. Bc ppl endorsed it.
@jradavenport absolutely. This should be a pretty straight forward situation.
I don't speak for them and can't say how people feel, but I wonder if people have considered that possibility?
Do people care that there might be Hawaiian astronomers, young ones, who are feeling totally alienated by the community right now?
Wonder if astronomers discussing the email have considered that there are Hawaiian astronomers who aren't Paul Coleman reading these things?
@ashpags @teagazer excellent work!!
Now circular discussion about whether the embarrassment caused by racism is worse or the racism is worse. THE RACISM IS WORSE.
@teagazer although you should have seen how the smile was wiped off his face just now when he saw this exchange. I'm laughing so hard.
@teagazer STRONG WORK VICKY!!!!
@teagazer me anger shopping at sephora is going to make my husband sad when he sees how much I bought lol
@teagazer I'm mostly now concerned about the more junior person who started the thread :-(
I don't care if a Hawaiian person killed your mom. There is still no excuse for "lying Hawaiian hordes." It's racist. Racist. Racist racist.
People think I'm joking about Sephora, but I am not.
