All that I'm focused on now is pulling my head together and doing things that bring me peace and happiness.
Tennis concert in five days and Lana Del Rey concert in two weeks. So stoked to see them both live!
I never felt good enough for certain people &amp; then I realized it's not that I'm not enough, I just wasn't what they were looking for.
Can't wait to get my truck because then I'll be able to go anywhere whenever I want.
Would love to just have a nice conversation with someone right now

Laundry mat thoughts lead to rants on twitter
If you are not happy with yourself and who you are how do you expect to be happy with anything else in life?
Instead people spend more time picking themselves apart and hating themselves. The only thing that remains at the end of the day is you.
Maybe if more people embraced who they are and all that they could be it wouldn't be so hard to be happy.
@zackadieh it loves you zack
@ashmarie_brown if we lived in the same town you don't know how down id be to do that with you
Sometimes it's nice doing my laundry because I can relax at the laundry mat and just reflect a little.

Going to devote a lot more time to my sisters, I've really neglected my duties as a big sister.

Looking through pictures and treasuring the moments even if the people in them are gone
Who I've grown to be, what I do, and whatever I amount to in this life will never make my parents happy.

Hate how cold hospitals are
So frustrated. Just want my uncle to get treated already
Do not enjoy seeing my uncle have all these tubes and stuff on him even though it's not major it's still scary as fuck
I think they hold bad memories for almost everyone though
Hospitals hold the worst memories for my family and that is why I feel so numb when I'm here
5 in the morning hospital run
I love when you think someone's not going to reply and then they surprise you and actually do

"We've had the the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful. If there's one thing I know about all of that, is that it was worth it" -dad
It feels so nice being treasured and loved by my parents again. Working through all the grief and hardships has definitely paid off.
No way dads jamming to the Beatles right now
Mom and dad are taking me out and showing me some secret cool spots in San Diego pretty cool<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I think it's funny how my gym bill is $20.14 every month and its the year 2014

I couldn't be any happier that my relationship with my mom has gotten so good that she texts me sweet messages now<HEART WITH ARROW> 
“@Sarah_Finnell: late night phone calls &gt;&gt;” or late night FaceTime<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

Day 3 of 3 work days in a row and it looks like it my last day. Hoping it ends on a good note.
Well I've been afraid of changing 'cause  I've built my life around you
Don't feel good enough
Thank god for good music and a comfy bed
Finding out the your grandma, aunt, and two little cousins are all coming down for your graduation, my day has been made<HEART WITH ARROW>
The closer I get the further I have to go to places we don't know

Get to sit outside and read a good book for the rest of the period, it's a lovely day.
Things that are bad always taste nice
Yeah I'm not going back to sleep
@D_Saenz44 no we have not
"sometimes what we want isn't what we get, sometimes what we get ain't really what we want"
When someone asks you if you're okay don't lie to them and say you are if you're not
@PresidentGrimm I completely agree with you, it's nice to know I'm not the only one<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Being someone with anxiety, this really spoke to me. Wonder if it actually works, it's a good thought. 
Sitting on the balcony enjoying the night and feeling sprinkles hit my face. This world is beautiful man
“Never be afraid to fall apart because it is an opportunity to rebuild yourself the way you wish you had been all along"
With the amount of coffee I've had today I don't like I'll sleep until like 3
Nothing makes me more sad then knowing my amazing grandma who has practically been my mama doesn't have much time left.
I really need to think about things before I make a final decision.
I'm happy to have a boss that loves me like family
One last shot, so I'm going to give it all I got
You shouldn't let life get the best of you, you should get the best out of this life
I'm way to sensitive
It's never too late to change your ways, and that's what I'm going to do<SUN WITH FACE>
Surprisingly had a great day, I think it's because I drank coffee when I woke up for the first time in like 10 months<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
