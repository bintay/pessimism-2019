I prefer ugali choma to that kfc garbage they sell.
Basically tukiwa twitter and you tell someone they have a low IQ based on wordplay, your telling them you're a better rapper.
Judging a person's IQ by one's ability to play with words on twitter is weak.
Going aganist the system on the other hand is like jumping off a cliff and hoping u'll fly...
The system sometimes limits us from achieving our true potential....
I'm really starting to understand this 2030 shit.
Can't knock the struggle, i'll drink mnazi to that.
The best way to counter negative people is by ignoring them.

Men and women are equal....how?  Biologically this is incorrect.
During the day she's giving you commands and at night she gets ploughed by some nikka? Hawes niambia kitu
If she loves the D she can't be a leader.

You cant hold ambition in for long , sooner or later...
mnazi is the shiet lol
parents get mad when we ask for iphones yet expect us to answer all their questions regarding technology..
Ignorance and too much conservativeness may bite you in the a** 30 years from now
.Its always been like that though, in ancient  civillizations youths fought each other for these,today there's rap battles and cyphers.
Every young person today wants money, bitches and weed...and to be a celebrity.
...that explains why people who are high always want to jump off a balcony, they got the theory right but are too lazy to consider details
Pragmatism works better with a dose of THC in your system.
I think we need to recognize ourselves and our cultural identity in order to respect other cultures.
As much as we are all one people, we also need a sense of identity.
My worst fear is being like 'everybody else' and 'fitting in'.
NEver be afraid to be called weird..that's what pulls you away from mediocre minds/thinking.
Why rape kids? Jus go be a pornstar nshit.
At the end of the day i think we're all one people with a common origin.
