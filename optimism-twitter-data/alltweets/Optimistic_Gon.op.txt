Not New To FTRP!
Hearing @EmperorOfArkham whisker into his ear, Gon would let out a moan. "Ugh.... Ngggg." He groaned and moaned as he just laid there.
-- head as he was out like a baby sleeping. @EmperorOfArkham
Taking the blow to the head, Gon would fall to his knees and everything went black as a gash of blood streamed from his-- @EmperorOfArkham
-- As he walked in deeper he could barely see @EmperorOfArkham and only hear their footsteps. "So who's hiding? And who's seeking?"
Following @EmperorOfArkham into the back alley there wasn't a soul around. He stepped in puddles and it smelt like garbage and piss.--
-- mind that @EmperorOfArkham was going to hurt him. Or do worse like torture, mane, kill or even experiment on his body.
Hearing that @EmperorOfArkham wanted to play a game, made Gon smile. "Sure thing lead the way," he replied. The thought never crossed his--

"Hmmmm..."
@EvaPilotAsuka "Good morning! How are you?" The child asked in a polite tone and smiled warmly.
"I can't breathe." He mumbled to @HugeBouncyBoobs as it sounded like something else.
His nose and face stank into @HugeBouncyBoobs giant cleavage.
He blushed deeply and struggled about as he couldn't get free from @HugeBouncyBoobs
"Got it..." He laughed nervously . @HugeBouncyBoobs
"Still? Well it might be forever. Since I have a girlfriend now." @HugeBouncyBoobs

@Ouorigami 

"I don't know. A fluke? I'm not sure how I got here myself?" He rubbed his sides and dusted off his human clothes.
@iGrandCouturier 

-- nothing he had ever faced before. "I... I could have died. You were just toying with me.."
@iGrandCouturier 

-- back to torture me and Ryuko-san?" He asked her. Meeting this Couturier had brought fear into the boy as she was like-
@iGrandCouturier 

"Really?" He asked her as he stood up slowly, still applying pressure to his wounded sides. "What happens if you come--
@Ouorigami 

"No. I'm a human. From the world of the living."

@iGrandCouturier 

-- listening to Ryuko-san. He would hold on to his wound as he lost his balance and fell to the ground. "S-sorry...."
@iGrandCouturier 

Feeling the scissor blade stab him, he began to grit his teeth and cough up blood. She was right and he should have--
@iGrandCouturier || I think you're awesome.
@iGrandCouturier 

-- nothing about your mothers plans. Just that Ryuko told me I should have run before this battle began."

"Plans?!" He asked as he raised a brow and lifted his head up as this was the first time he had heard about it. "I know--
@iGrandCouturier 

-- all my best moves. But.... but you are like nothing I've ever faced before."

"Why you..." He said as he couldn't move his body while she moved in closer. "I wasn't underestimating you! I was using--
@iGrandCouturier 

-- He asked as he went to lift himself back up and looked around. "I thought that I was going to punch you?"
@iGrandCouturier 

Thinking he was going to connect the punch, Gon soon lost his balance and fell to the ground. "What... what happened?"--
@PeachySuperstar "Sure thing." He said and smiled warmly. "Maybe I can train with you too? But I still want to step into the ring with you."
