That you weren't coming back
And so I kept you alive in my mind,
But in the end, 
I killed myself with memories"

Um  excuse you sir, go back to your seat, you crossed the line that YOU made.
That's just dandy <UNAMUSED FACE> I don't get how you can be jealous when you let me go.
You can be jealous it just doesn't make sense but you can be jealous but don't get mad at me.
I fell in love from the moment we kissed since then we've been history.
That was extremely weird but needed talk.
Why does everyone hate me today? <UNAMUSED FACE>
