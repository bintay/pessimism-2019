Coach K's letter to MJ when he learned he wouldn't be coming to Duke

Remember when Duke almost fired Coach K after 3 seasons? That was 32 yrs ago.  Sometimes patience is the answer #leadership #DukeVsMSU
Whenever I hear the announcer say, "Coach K in his 35th yr at Duke" all I can think about is how he was almost fired after 3 yrs. Amazing

@DickieV you look ready!  Say something about these guys playing D!  Awesome game!
If you like defense, you have to love this game.  WOW!  Reminds me of Big East Games from the late 80s &amp; 90s #Elite8 #NDvsUK

Day 4 of 365 - Remember when everyone was posting Day 1 of 365?  Day 4 is just as important.  Each day = opportunity. So, start now!
I was asked, do you ever get tired of change?
Response: If I do, please put me out to pasture.
#change is what makes us better
@kbohls Yes, when they have undisciplined penalties.
@ValaAfshar wrong reply…well said on this one!  LOL!
@ValaAfshar Yes, when they have undisciplined penalties.
Very, very sad to see that Stuart Scott has passed away.  He and Rich Eisen are still my fav Sportcenter hosts ever.  RIP
How many times will you do this in January. :-) - proof that habits are hard to break. 
Day 3 of 365 - anyone still out there?  The key to change is not setting the goal.  It is making the goal a habit.
Day 2 of 365 - The goal was set yesterday.  So, how is it going today?
@ValaAfshar of course, the manager can ask the leader to learn how to develop excellence.  ;-)
The formula is actually not that complicated:
Preparation + goal setting + work ethic + perseverance + attitude = SUCCESS
