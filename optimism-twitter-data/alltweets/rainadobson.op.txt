@CyndiToy @TheHeat001 @TravisAaronWade @janieloves6 Cyndi, you have to watch #TheFix with Travis &amp; @robertpatrickT2 
@CyndiToy @TheHeat001 @TravisAaronWade @janieloves6 I just found this... So disappointing.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> 
So, @CyndiToy this is really how Californians talk, right? Travis said it. So it must be true. LOL @TheOrlandoJones @TravisAaronWade
Travis "Like a 10" Wade on #TheCalifornians @TheOrlandoJones @TravisAaronWade 
I liked a @YouTube video from @TheOrlandoJones 
@cala_gobraith @InabaKaen @indecisivelemon @janieloves6 And Aislynn was next to Mark or the other way around?
@cala_gobraith @InabaKaen @indecisivelemon @janieloves6 But I'm having trouble w Samantha and Aislynn... Samantha were you sitting by Tracy?

think about... So, show of hands, have I made a positive impact on your life? #ChattyFam #OTW
me curious... I know at least one person that I've had a positive impact on, but maybe there are others that I don't know about or don't
So the next task that I've been assigned to 'get happy' is to think about someone in my life that I've had a positive impact on... This made
Give @TravisAaronWade a Gold Star for this one! #OTW

Bravery-knowingly joining a gym where half your students go... <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> @BreeCart7 @TravisAaronWade
@janieloves6 @TravisAaronWade YES!! <GRINNING FACE>
I figure as long as I'm going 2 LA for @HomeboyInd 5K, I might as well stay for the RNR Half! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> @janieloves6 @TravisAaronWade @LaurenTom9000
@janieloves6 @TravisAaronWade LOL You better! That's why I signed up for the LA one instead of Vegas! Haha <FACE THROWING A KISS>
.@janieloves6 @travisaaronwade I just signed up for the 2015 Rock 'n' Roll Los Angeles Half Marathon! 
@BreeCart7 And I'm not talking about a couple of pieces of candy. I mean BAGS of it! And it's only been for the past month or so. <CONFUSED FACE>
@BreeCart7 It's more than poor judgement because I'm tired. It's literally uncontrollable. I CANNOT stop eating sugar! <CRYING FACE>
@BreeCart7 And I think I might know why I've had uncontrollable craving for sweets... Lack of sleep causes body to crave boost in energy.
@BreeCart7 Going now to check out the gym. #ShouldHaveBroughtExerciseClothes
Hmmm... Are you sure it was Gretchen? Because it definitely has the sound of @TravisAaronWade with #OTWChallenge <WINKING FACE> 
24 hour relaunch. @oohbarista 
As my student just pointed out..today is a palindrome 5-1-15
Makes me wonder what @TravisAaronWade was thinking about... #TheFix #GladHeWasntLookingAtMe 
@ChelseaKH13 May 28? You must go back earlier in August. I wish we did that here. It's a pain to end the semester 2 weeks after Winter Break
@ChelseaKH13 I teach in Vegas.
@BreeCart7 lol
@BreeCart7 lol
@ChelseaKH13 lol 
@ChelseaKH13 Teacher last day is June 5. Students get out on June 4.

@BreeCart7 Here, admin unlocks the teachers' rooms for Senior Prank. <POUTING FACE>
@BreeCart7 We wouldn't have been allowed to attend graduation. Same with Senior Prank. I never saw the point of either one.
@ChelseaKH13 LOL Nope! That's still coming up! <FLUSHED FACE>
@bjxmas Right?!? Sigh..

@BreeCart7 I think I'm just gonna have to start going to a gym (air conditioning) so that I can run at 3:30 rather than 6:30... <CONFUSED FACE>
@BreeCart7 LOL.. I get tired between 2:00-5:00... Too early to go to bed. I ran into that problem LAST weekend! LOL Nap at 2-awake all night
@BreeCart7 Thanks. <FACE THROWING A KISS>


@WinchesterBros <WINKING FACE> 

@BreeCart7 I can't get to sleep at a proper time, then I don't get enough sleep at night making me tired the next day and around and around
@BreeCart7 And it did and that's the problem. It's too hot to run earlier. The boost I get so close to bedtime means I can't sleep.
@BreeCart7 @TravisAaronWade LOL, right?!?! <WINKING FACE>
Thank you Imaginary @TravisAaronWade  for telling me such nice things!! LOL<FACE THROWING A KISS>
Some ppl have voices in their heads saying ugly things. I've got @TravisAaronWade in my head saying 'You're strong.' And 'You got this!' <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>üèª
@ChelseaKH13 @TravisAaronWade lol
AND to come up with an alternative to running so late that I can't get to sleep...@TravisAaronWade
I don't know how he did it (magic? mind control?), but @TravisAaronWade convinced me to run tonight.
@thePhouka @trut4h @TravisAaronWade Thank you, my dear! And you know, with Travis, money will go to a good cause. <FACE THROWING A KISS>

@BreeCart7 @TravisAaronWade @trut4h @abctrower It really did! And the pic is pretty bad. It looks much better in person!

@BreeCart7 @ddesmond02 38 more days... And yes! Teachers count down, too! Lol
@BreeCart7 Most of my students aren't going to college, but yes, I agree.

@NYsparklergirl @BreeCart7 @TravisAaronWade Hmmm.. 3 Johns, a Jane, and a Woman in White.. 11 minutes...
For the past month, I've had a pretty severe case of No Motivation. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@NYsparklergirl @BreeCart7 @TravisAaronWade Thank you, my dear. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@BreeCart7 @NYsparklergirl @TravisAaronWade My question as well.
Oh man... 400... I don't like that number... Someone please follow me to get me off 400...
@ddesmond02 @TravisAaronWade Plus it's spring-4th Quarter-zero motivation... Added to super busy... It's gonna be a while.. lol
@ddesmond02 @TravisAaronWade Ive put in maybe 20 hours on my Travis quilt.. VERY far from done. Barely even started.
@ddesmond02 @TravisAaronWade In the neighborhood of 150 hours...
@nance10706 lol
@ddesmond02 @BreeCart7 Thanks! I have to admit... I have the 4th Quarter blues... I'm usually a bit more positive in Sept. <WINKING FACE>
@ddesmond02 That is many months off. I have barely started working on my @TravisAaronWade quilt...
@ddesmond02 Smooches
@BreeCart7 They have no desire to learn.... Which, of course, is always blamed on the teacher..
@ddesmond02 Aww...<CONFUSED FACE> Mine is just dull... No real pain.
@BreeCart7 It's so epidemic that they don't even consider it wrong. Worst offenders are the honors kids...actually still care about grade<CONFUSED FACE>
That dull, drowsy, headachy feeling from too much sleep is so much better than that dull drowsy, headachy feeling from not enough...
I would much rather be watching THIS than anything that is ever shown on the news.... #freedomfromcancer 
Cheating is universal. Students don't even bother to hide it anymore. They shrug when they get caught because they know it won't affect them
As a fellow teacher, I understand the frustration-Texas A&amp;M Galveston professor fails entire class

@CarrieCline1 Good idea! Thank you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@CarrieCline1 I haven't been lucky enough to experience a Jared hug, but Travis is definitely a GOOD CUDDLER. <WINKING FACE>
Truly, is there anything more efficient than a hug which instantly imparts pure happiness to both parties? @Mandy_Musgrave
Lemonade is a great thirst quencher, but that first sip of sour that follows sweet is... <WEARY FACE>
Getting back to everyday, real life after HAPPY is a lot like drinking a glass of lemonade after eating Death By Chocolate<CRYING FACE> @TravisAaronWade
Has anyone figured out a way to avoid the emotional crash that inevitably follows incredibly wonderful moments of pure happiness?
And yes, I'm a lucky, lucky, LUCKY girl that has received enough @TravisAaronWade hugs to determine that he changes his hugs based on need
So, that's my goal. I want any hug I give to impart the same degree of feel good as a @TravisAaronWade hug. Travis, what's the secret? <FACE THROWING A KISS>
FYI, @TravisAaronWade is the BEST hugger. He delivers perfect amount of squeeze for optimal length of time all based on current need.

But when @TravisAaronWade told me that I was STRONG (strength of character), I felt beautiful on the inside...where it actually matters.
When @TravisAaronWade told me that I looked nice, it was one of the rare times that I felt beautiful on the outside.

@TravisAaronWade I love the t-shirt! Where can I get one? Do they have a website?

How's this for weird? @LouDPhillips RT me! Not bad for a math teacher from a small town half the size of my school! <WINKING FACE> 
@BreeCart7 They live in Oneida.
@BreeCart7 I have some cousins in IL.. Hmm. I'll have to ask my mom where they live.
@BreeCart7 Ahhh.. So closer to I-70 than I-80...
@BreeCart7 Yep <GRINNING FACE>
@BreeCart7 Are you in the Chicago area?
@BreeCart7 I did a 5K yesterday.. Maybe that's what got you confused.. 5K = 3.1 miles
@BadAssNamedAsh Thank you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@BreeCart7 ?? The one I'm training for?
@BreeCart7 Yep, I usually drive I-80 thru IL, but I-70 isn't that far out of the way.
@BreeCart7 @Lady_MickeyD @janieloves6 I-80 I think.. Let's see. I-15 to I-70 to I-76 to I-80 to I-94.... I think. I'd have to look at a map.
@BadAssNamedAsh based off the book... Maybe just shot the pilot??? Hmmm
@BadAssNamedAsh No, the one that Travis was in...
@BreeCart7 @Lady_MickeyD @janieloves6 So we can meet on my way home to MI this summer????? Pleeeeeease???

@Lady_MickeyD @janieloves6 Hmmm... Do you want me to ask him???
@janieloves6 @Lady_MickeyD Jane what about your work schedule. Could you make an afternoon showtime this Friday?
@Lady_MickeyD @janieloves6 LOL yes!

@Lady_MickeyD @janieloves6 No, that's on May 8

@Lady_MickeyD @janieloves6  You're right. Long drive alone... I'd be willing...

@oohbarista My bad dreams usually involve not being able to find my classroom or being late to class.
@oohbarista I'm pretty lucky. I don't generally remember my dreams and rarely have nightmares.
@oohbarista Right?!? Sigh..
@oohbarista <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@oohbarista Aww... Good dream turned bad? <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> That's the worst! Like doubly bad<DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK>Ô∏è

@janieloves6 I wake up at 3:00 so that I have enough time to exercise and make my lunch and dinner to take to work with me. <CONFUSED FACE>

@oohbarista @BreeCart7 These are the fabrics I ordered. From very dark purple (my fav) thru to blue (Travis' fav). <WINKING FACE> 
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista The first or the second?
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista @TravisAaronWade 
@ddesmond02 
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista @TravisAaronWade I want to make it a mini. Maybe 0.5" finished squares. The whole quilt 8.5"X10". Hmmm..
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista @TravisAaronWade <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista @TravisAaronWade This is the fabric I want to use. 
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista @TravisAaronWade This design with different fabric. 
@MamaPrior @fredsfam LOL
@MamaPrior @fredsfam As if Shep were looking over Tom's shoulder..
@MamaPrior @fredsfam What about tucking Shep behind Tom with their faces close together? Could you do that?
@MamaPrior @fredsfam If you can make it square, then YEEEEEEEES!!!! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@MamaPrior @fredsfam To be square?
@MamaPrior @fredsfam Remember, quilts were originally intended to go on beds... Longer up and down.
@MamaPrior @fredsfam Quilts look very strange if they are longer side to side instead up square or longer up and down.
@fredsfam @jarpad They ARE and would be perfect if the pic was a profile pic (square rather than rectangular). Have you seen the original?
@djavudu LOL Not a bad idea for my morning exercise...

@BreeCart7 @oohbarista In fact, @TravisAaronWade inspired me to design a new quilt entitled 'Painting from Dark to Light.'
@oohbarista @BreeCart7 I know. That's just one reason why I love you. You brighten my days. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ddesmond02 @BreeCart7 @oohbarista I am! Thank you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>

Thanks for all the virtual hugs this morning. I love you all! #ChattyFam #OTW @TravisAaronWade
But having a big family means there is always someone there who can fill you back up and get you started again.
@djavudu Good point. I've been there, too.

Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again.... 'The Sound of Silence'
Being an introvert is a bit like having a gas tank with a broken gas gauge. You never really know when you are going to run out of gas.
@BreeCart7 @oohbarista Need some of your sunshine this morning. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> Have any to spare? L&amp;H
@djavudu Thank you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Terene_Eruvanda And for you as well. Hugs.
@Terene_Eruvanda Hi! And thanks! What started out as an enjoyable afternoon of quilting turned into...too much time in my own head. LOL
After some recent events, I decided to make this @QuiltsForKids quilt in memory of @EuryLingerie . L&amp;H 
@inlovewith_d Thank you! I needed that! And I'm so lucky that I have all of you to help me through the dark days. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@bjxmas LOL Good idea! I'm headed up to bed now. Thank you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@inlovewith_d Thank you. I just spent the whole afternoon thinking about depression and suicide... with predictable results. Better tomorrow
Stress+depression+lonely+tired+bad news = a very sincere hope that I'll feel better tomorrow. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
As I reached for the candy (yet again), I realized I was trying to eat my way to happy. Sometimes alone morphs into lonely &amp; bad news clings
@nance10706 @jarielynn @lmc776 Good memories! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
#WhatsSupSunday give a shoutout to someone you haven't said hello to in a minute. Post pic #ChattyFam 
Wow! Just... Wow!... He amazes me. @TravisAaronWade (And I really hope he never plays a 'Kevin' ever again! So annoying! LOL)
I've been watching @TravisAaronWade episodes all afternoon &amp; his characters are all so different, from sociopath Turner to douchebag Kevin.
@mitchmarie12 @Hiyaboopers @NYsparklergirl @Bratzmama @ddesmond02 Sorry... No hair touching for me..
@Bratzmama @mitchmarie12 @ddesmond02 @NYsparklergirl You nailed it!! Agree 100%
@Bratzmama @ddesmond02 @mitchmarie12 @NYsparklergirl LOL Now THAT'S saying something! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@mitchmarie12 @NYsparklergirl Ummm..  To Bill probably not.. No guarantees with Travis... Just sayin..
@NYsparklergirl @mitchmarie12 LOL
@NYsparklergirl LOL and back atcha. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@NYsparklergirl True, but I've never had a conversation with him.. Even our phone call was short because he was on his bike.
@mitchmarie12 He was very quiet....mostly in the background. Do you think he's an introvert?
@NYsparklergirl Goodness! Now you're making ME nervous! Ugh! LOL
@mitchmarie12 Very polite. Oh! And I got his autograph on my autograph quilt!! <GRINNING FACE> 
@mitchmarie12 LOL.. It's a bit of a blur, but after the pic, he called Travis over so that I could have a pic with both... So sweet.
@NYsparklergirl @BatTeddy LOL I've never used a webcam. So I might have problems, too! Haha

@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 @TravisAaronWade I can hear it in my head, but that's not the same...
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 @TravisAaronWade Because I really need Travis' encouragement as I train and during the race.
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 @TravisAaronWade I'm going to figure out a way to make this happen!
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 @TravisAaronWade I was thinking today how much I would love to hear Travis saying these things in my ear...
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 @TravisAaronWade I have this running app that will say periodically "You can do it" or "Keep going".
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 @TravisAaronWade YAY!!! <GRINNING FACE><GRINNING FACE><GRINNING FACE><GRINNING FACE> Travis would be proud! L&amp;H Smooches!

@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 He had, just seconds before, hugged me and whispered in my ear... I was DELIRIOUSLY happy! <WINKING FACE>
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 LOL
@winchesterl0v3 @NYsparklergirl I may or may not have rubbed... Just a little.. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>

@winchesterl0v3 @NYsparklergirl 
@winchesterl0v3 @NYsparklergirl I told him once that every time he fav's one of my tweets, it feels like a hug... But a irl hug is better! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@janieloves6 @NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 Yes! Glasses are sexy! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 And yay! We'll meet in NJ! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 He even manages to do this when there is a group.
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 He looks you in the eye and listens to what you say. It's an incredible feeling.
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 He has an amazing gift for making every person he talks to feel like they are important..
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 YES!!! Brains are beautiful! <WINKING FACE>
@winchesterl0v3 @NYsparklergirl Did either of you two go to VegasCon?
@NYsparklergirl @winchesterl0v3 IDK if it is because I wear glasses, but both Travis and Jensen do it for me.

@heather_deane3 @jarielynn @janieloves6 Locked?
@jarielynn @janieloves6 Jeri, do you know why you can tag some people but not others? For example, @heather_deane3 can't be tagged in pic..?

Despite how much I want to stay up &amp; watch #TheReturned, my body is saying 'You're too old to be up past your bedtime!' <WEARY FACE> @MarkRPellegrino
@ChelseaKH13 @TravisAaronWade @JensenAckles That's when I gave it to him, during the panel.
@ChelseaKH13 @TravisAaronWade I think so... Besides, I ENJOY doing it! It relaxes me. It both mindless and mindful at the same time.
@MarkRPellegrino So..What are the chances that you're gonna live-tweet #TheReturned tonight? If yes, I'll stay up. If no, past my bedtime<SLEEPING FACE>
@ChelseaKH13 @TravisAaronWade LOL That's why it takes me months to complete. <WINKING FACE>
@ChelseaKH13 put any cells together to make a larger piece (less cutting and sewing).
@ChelseaKH13 This is actually early version of pattern. After I get this far, I have to go back thru, checking every cell, to see if I can
Special shoutout to @Lady_MickeyD and @janieloves6 for their incredibly generous donations 2 my fundraising campaign! 
@ChelseaKH13 If you zoom in on this, you can see the pattern I'm using for @TravisAaronWade quilt. 
@janieloves6 Class doesn't get over until 1:30 and I don't get out of work till 2:00... <TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE> @jasonmanns
@ChelseaKH13 Once I have the pattern (30-40 hours), I pick out fabric. Cut it up into 1" finished squares &amp; sew them together.
@ChelseaKH13 a cross-stitch pattern. Then I enter each stitch (4096) into Excel. This (with a lot more work) creates a pattern.
@ChelseaKH13 Sure! I get the pic and blank out the background. I put the pic thru 
@janieloves6 It's too early... <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@ChelseaKH13 It will take a while before I have a chance to work on @jarpad quilt...
@ChelseaKH13 Ok. Keep in mind that this whole quilt process takes months! And I'm working on @TravisAaronWade quilt right now.
@Lady_MickeyD LOL How many sick days do I have accumulated??? Hmmmm...
@ChelseaKH13 @realGpad @bodyguard4JandJ I'll make a quilt regardless. It would just be easier if pic were more appropriate for my needs. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Lady_MickeyD LOL.. Today was awful! First day back from Spring Break &amp; CCSD decides to observe me TODAY?!? Ugh! LOL
@ChelseaKH13 I haven't heard back from @realGpad or @bodyguard4JandJ I'm still waiting and hoping for a pic that is closer and lighter... <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@jasonmanns @jameson_us Just wish I could go... <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> 1:00 pm is too early. Still at school. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> Two shows?????? Pleeeeeeeeeease????
Last week I ate ton of candy, barely exercised. By Sun, felt like <PILE OF POO>. Today, good food, exercise. Feel better. Coincidence? @TravisAaronWade
@Lady_MickeyD weird because I've never been a runner, but... IDK It helps with the depression (walking doesn't for me) and diet. Win win! <GRINNING FACE>

@j2freak4ever Ok. I'll try it. Thanks!
@j2freak4ever I'm new to FB. I don't know how to contact someone thru FB. ??
@jarielynn Good! Being prepared for a test reduces stress levels which in turn improve results. You'll be fine! L&amp;H
@j2freak4ever That's a good idea. Someone suggested it yesterday and I sent him a request. Hoping to hear back. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@jarielynn Study hard! You'll do fine! You got this! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@jarielynn Good morning! <GRINNING FACE> I forgot when your test is. Soon? Smooches. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
It's a difficult thing for me to do by myself. I have trouble differentiating between "I'm stressed. It's bad." And "I need help."
Usually for me, the higher the stress levels the deeper the depression. Anyone out there willing to help me monitor my stress/depression?
The relief I felt last week on Spring Break compared with the stress at just the thought of returning to work today.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> The next 9 wks..sigh

@MamaPrior @fredsfam LOL well, I have an easier job.. I think. No merging necessary.
@MamaPrior @fredsfam I just had to get over the 'it has to be Jared' mindset. <WINKING FACE>
@MamaPrior @fredsfam Someone showed me this, and it is PERFECT.... With the background blanked out... Lol 
@MamaPrior @fredsfam In my mind, that is NOT FUN! Lol
@nina1121 I have someone hard at work doing that very thing! LOL great minds!! Haha.

@MamaPrior @fredsfam Is that something you could do? Take separate head shots and merge them? With plain white background? Easy? Difficult?
@MamaPrior @fredsfam I didn't want to ask... I know you're busy..
@Kat_2165 @fredsfam THANK YOU!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>

@MetteP0302 @fredsfam I really love that pic! I just wish it would work! <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT> It's not close enough for my software... <CONFUSED FACE>
@Kat_2165 @fredsfam I ADORE that pic.. But it won't work. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> My software won't work for full body pics.. Needs to be headshot. <CONFUSED FACE>

@TravisAaronWade This touches my heart... My grandpa passed when I was 12. Miss him.. #WWIIVeteran #USNavy 
@FireDancr2 I really had myself convinced! Lol It wasn't until I saw the vid that I realized he really did like it! Haha.
@ChelseaKH13 That's my hope! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@FireDancr2 Before the con, I had convinced myself that he wasn't gonna like it and I had a contingency plan. Lol
@FireDancr2 Right?!? Can you imagine if he had said he didn't like it?
@ChelseaKH13 I think it might work! <GRINNING FACE> 
@FireDancr2 Thank you! My friend caught his reaction on tape... I've only watched it 1 million times or so.. Lol
@ChelseaKH13 Ok, I'll send it thru my software and see what comes out. THANK YOU!!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@SPNBrotherhood @janieloves6 Right?!?! I really lucked out with my JJ&amp;Jensen pic! Haha
@Bratzmama @ChelseaKH13 is working on that right now... We're trying to make it work... Cross your fingers..
@ChelseaKH13 This is what happens when I crop it square. What do you think? 
@janieloves6 @SPNBrotherhood LOL Total fuzz ball! Which makes quilting it a NIGHTMARE!! Haha.. Ugh!
@ChelseaKH13 LOL
@JustDeanTeam Why thank you! I'm glad he liked it! <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
@Mz_Spn ICYMI.. A pic of my quilt. <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
@FireDancr2 I got the PO! <WINKING FACE> His reaction was everything I hoped for.. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
@SPNBrotherhood @janieloves6 I have someone working on this one... I'm hoping it will work. 
@ChelseaKH13 But I was teaching myself.. My @TravisAaronWade quilt will take less time because I have procedures now. 
@ChelseaKH13 Total? Pattern, piecing, and quilting? Approximately 150 hours.
@SPNBrotherhood @janieloves6 I think people would look at it and say 'What happened to his hand?'.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> Otherwise... Very cute!
@Bratzmama Unfortunately yes...  Very cute pic, but full body doesn't work with my software.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@ChelseaKH13 Thank you!!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ChelseaKH13 ok, can you zoom out a bit then? Quilt-wise, it either needs to be square or long-wise up and down rather than side to side.
@ChelseaKH13 Yes. Why oh why couldn't he be holding them symmetrically? Lol
@TravisAaronWade ?
@MarkRPellegrino ?
I look at actor/character as identical twins. Look alike at first meet, but the better you know them, the less they look the same. Yes? No?
@ChelseaKH13 The red eye looks great! Can you crop it square?
@fredsfam Thanks!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS>
@janieloves6 @SPNBrotherhood it IS very cute!
@janieloves6 @SPNBrotherhood Otherwise, yes....
@janieloves6 @SPNBrotherhood When I blank out the background, Tom loses half of his hand...
@SPNBrotherhood @fredsfam lol
@ChelseaKH13 Are you volunteering? Specifically, I need a square pic as close as you can get with a blank background.
@ChelseaKH13 Exactly! Or if it is the 3 of them, the pic won't work for other reasons... <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@fredsfam True! And that is soooo cute.. Aww..
@ChelseaKH13 @arielthenerd Yes and no... It could be cropped and would be the right size, but I really suck at photo editing/red-eye stuff.
@lmc776 LOL
@ChelseaKH13 @arielthenerd I LOVE that one.. And no, it won't work.. Lol thanks! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@fredsfam @SPNBrotherhood LOL.. Well who am I to say? I spend 150 hours making quilts.. Lol
@realGpad Would you consider sending me a pic I could use? I would really appreciate it! Thanks!
@realGpad I've looked online for a pic I could use, but no luck. It needs to be a closeup of just faces (headshot). Full body doesn't work.
@realGpad I want 2 make a quilt similar to JJ&amp;Jensen of Jared &amp; the boys, but I need a pic! Help??? 
@fredsfam @realGpad Not yet.. I tried asking Danneel and didn't get a response. Figured the same from Gen.. Can't hurt to ask, right? Ok.
@lmc776 GSOL!! LMAO! Haha... Nope.. Hahaha..
@lmc776 ??
@ChelseaKH13 @arielthenerd Yes, I need for it to be a closeup of faces (headshot). Full body doesn't work with my software.
@SPNBrotherhood @fredsfam If someone volunteers I wouldn't say no, but it's a big job and I hate to ask.. Ya know?
@ChelseaKH13 @arielthenerd THANKS!! <FACE THROWING A KISS><FACE THROWING A KISS> I want to do one for Jared, but I'm having trouble finding a good pic.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@fredsfam That would be great if I had the skill to do something like that! I don't do photo edits... <CONFUSED FACE>
@kessily Twitter?
@arielthenerd LOL, yeah, me and the million others looking for his attention... Lol
@SPNBrotherhood I might have to do that as a last resort.. Thanks for the pic. I hadn't seen this one yet! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@BigMoBook I've searched online, but I can't find anything like I need. If you know of a pic that I could use, would you send it my way? Thx
@BigMoBook The pic needs to be a closeup (headshot) of Jared and the boys. Full body pics don't work with my software.

@bodyguard4JandJ If you know of any pic that I could use of Jared and his boys (just faces), could you send it my way? THANKS! <FACE THROWING A KISS>

@NYsparklergirl Can't hurt to try, right? Ok, I'll ask.
@Moza_jf Yeah.. Don't do that either.. I just started FB a month ago.. Haha
@ddesmond02 @arielthenerd RIGHT?!? I love it! But..  <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@NYsparklergirl I haven't... I tried asking Danneel with no response. I just figured the same with Gen...??
@AnikiCrim @ddesmond02 Much better as far as distance, but I suck at the whole red-eye thing. My program wld make them all demons. LOL
@Moza_jf LOL. That's one thing I have yet to get into... I'm trying to avoid it. LOL
@arielthenerd @ddesmond02 I LOVE this one... It just isn't close enough... <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@ddesmond02 I know... <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@Moza_jf I do too! Just won't work for my quilt.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>

@Moza_jf They're both great pics, but aren't close enough for what I need. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> Thanks for looking! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ddesmond02 Same problem. If it were closer, this would be PERFECT!
@ddesmond02 I tried to make this one work, but it is not enough of a closeup.. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>

@heather_deane3 Yeah, if you can get past the busyness, the fabric is precious.
@bjxmas If you were to do one, this would be the pattern to do! It is the easiest pattern! <WINKING FACE>
@lmc776 Thanks! I needed a second opinion. I can be a harsh judge on my own work.
It's still cute.., just too busy..
Hmmm... I'm thinking solid black would have been a better choice rather than the multi-colored.. It's too busy.. Oh well. Live &amp; learn.
What do you guys think about my Mark quilt? A couple more hours and the top will be done. <GRINNING FACE>
