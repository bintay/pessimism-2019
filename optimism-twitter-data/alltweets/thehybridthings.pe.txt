Hot Phi Phi. 
Vote for Gravity by Papa Roach!!  
Their smiles. 
Chester's body is everything
I was watching the final minutes of the whole live and I was like "chester please take off your shirt" and after 20 secs he came shirtless
Bleed It Out is the classic ending song.
Wow Brad ruled in What I've Done solo at Rock In Rio USA.
Shinoda's crazy eyes. 
One question: How many tops did Brad change in Rock In Rio USA?
It kills me seeing Mike in the crowd. 
Mike kills it in Remember The Name
Remember The Name is so awesome.
"Do we have any Fort Minor fan out here tonight?"
"across this new divide"
I always remember the lyrics"I was chewing my gum you could hear me chewing.I love chewing gum"bc of Chaz in that making of New Divide video
New Divide's intro *_*
MR. HAAAAAAAAHN
I love Robot Boy. That melody!
I'm sorry but Aaron from OM&amp;M didn't do good backing vocals for Linkin Park's Iridescent. It was almost awful.
LOATR/SOTD/Iridescent. This medley ballad always get me.
"Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass. Hardly anything there for you to see."
Wastelands give me Papercut's mood.
Phoenix is so hot with his new sleeve tattoo. I just can't.
Chester's scream is heaven! I am in heaven.
Why has Chester been messing up the Wastelands chorus lately? lol.
A Line In The Sand was a difficult song to play live but Linkin Park pulled it off just awesome!
watching linkin park's live at rock in rio usa, las vegas. so awesome. i've missed them. 
@DTwistedSauce Glitter can never be enough for Magnus. He's the best :)
Loving, caring, understanding, forgiving, beautiful. Happy Mother's Day to my mom and to every mother… 
@TMIToronto - give them a chance ofc :)
@TMIToronto Yeah, I know but I still want the old cast. I'm so connected to them. I'm disappointed for some cast choices now but I will -
@TMIToronto I choose Godfrey Gao
Godfrey Gao will always be my Magnus Bane. 
Godfrey Gao is the ideal Magnus. 
Iris: What did they do to you?

their faces are just a stab in the heart 
so many heartbreaking episodes are coming
this upcoming week it's the week with season finales or 1 ep. before season finales but I'll be busy studying for my finals fml
The way Eddie looks at Iris is just killing me. What have they done to him? 
Kai is such a bastard. I hate him.
Why can't anyone get a happy ending on tvd?
Alaric and Joe deserved their happy ending but they didn't get it. All because of Kai.
Just watched tvd.
Hot mess. 
His body is seriously hot. #HappyBirthdayStephenAmell 
His smile gives me life. #HappyBirthdayStephenAmell 
Extremely talented, funny, kind, loving. Oh and dangerously hot. #HappyBirthdayStephenAmell Sweet 34 xx 
@jerryhorton Hope For The Hopeless and Fear Hate Love. Powerful songs!!
When your dad knows your favorite shows but still confuses them and make a reference out of it 
my dad is cool
Loved this episode's opening and the fact that Iris was the one speaking. 
@dxlphinecormier yeah but it's so cool using colored tissues rathen than the regular color (white) it makes you want to use them more :)
@jery_jesuitical what?
@dxlphinecormier they would be more fancy if they were turqoise. *still not over it*
Idk whether to be excited for arrow s3 finale or not. But I know that I'm gonna need twice as much tissues as usual.
Omg, this promo for s3 finale. It would be the death of me. 
@dxlphinecormier - turquoise as well so I was disappointed when I saw they were just white, lol
@dxlphinecormier haha, they're cute. but when the saleslady told me to choose color &amp; I picked this I thought the tissues were going to be-
@dxlphinecormier haha idk, they gave it to me for free with my purchases xD I was surprised as well.
These all were from Arrow 3x22. Couldn't hold my tears. 
Tissues are for issues.
R.I.P Akio Yamashiro. R.I.P Maseo Yamashiro.
I need anti-cry tissues when I'm watching series.
So Oliver and Nyssa are husband and wife now?!
They're all unconscious
What are you doing Nyssa?
I'm sure that thing thrown in there is just a hypnotic. Well, I hope so.
So many demon names. Can't keep up.
I'm sure Oliver is one step ahead. I'm sure he has a plan. He wouldn't hurt his friends. No way.
"You asked us to trust us and we trusted you."
I so pitty Oliver.
Such a tragic episode.
Roy's letter. *grabs another tissue*
Malcom is such a traitor. Always caring for himself and nothing else. He deserves to die.
John doesn't trust and respect Ollie anymore? Disappointed.
Thea and Roy are made for each other.
Colton is so hot with this little beard I just can't handle it
The world is on fire and so is Roy's bed, lol.
Maseo: Tell Akio I love him.
Tatsu: You can tell it for both of us. *stabs him*
Maseo: Thank you for releasing me.
I just can't <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Tatsu released Maseo. Their love is just so powerful.
Thank god I have klinex right next to me.
Crying my eyes out. Maseo is dead.
Tatsu's mask is kinda scary but I like it
Tatsu Yamashiro is amazing!
I ship Thea with Roy so much. My babies <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Arrow is starting to make no sense. Why would Ra's al ghul want to destroy Starling city especially now that he has Ollie on his hand?
"Time to go home." I have no idea what Eobard Thawne considers as a home.
Omg what is that gorilla thing doing?
Bring Eddie back now Barry
"Eddie, is the man I live with, the man that I love and he's still missing."
Please Iris don't cheat on Eddie
Iris is so gorgeous
Omg I love their friendship
As much as I don't ship Barry with Iris I love the strong bond they have
Barry my baby is suffering
Poor Joe omg. I would shit myself if I was trapped with a supernatural &amp; paranoid gorilla.
I want Iris with Eddie
Barry - Iris - Eddie 
I hate that love triangle
Can I have a caramel macchiato every morning please?
Watching The Flash <HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN> 
Spending my morning watching The Flash while drinking Caramel Macchiato <SPARKLES><HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN> 
#nowwatching #theflash… 
@JackSWS You're perfect! Love you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I hope Rebekah turns back to her original body. I miss Claire Holt.
If you think you have the worst family, remember The Originals family.
How could Klaus compel Gia to put out her daylight ring and burn just like that in front of Elijah? He's a monster.
Well, as it looks like Klaus is planning something genius but that doesn't undo his horrible actions
Just watched the originals and i was about to cry 100 times while watching it
Screen caps from The Strays music video <HEAVY BLACK HEART> 
Will never forget this stelena moment. 
@JacobyShaddix @kellyshaddix This is the sweetest!!
Strykuinn sounds like a nice ship name. 
I ship these two. They're amazing. 
I hope Better Off Dead or Fly will be the next music video. @SWStheband
Screen caps from The Strays music video @SWStheband 
@SWStheband @iHeartRadio Just watched it. It's really beautiful &lt;3
@SWStheband @iHeartRadio omg yes thank you!!!
@iHeartRadio  For which music video you had the best experience shooting? #iHeartSWS
@iHeartRadio Will it be nudes? Just kidding :) #iHeartSWS
@iHeartRadio How did you decide to go from very long album/songs titles to very short titles? :) #iHeartSWS @SWStheband
@iHeartRadio  Who is the most lazy in the band? #iHeartSWS
@GenesisLPF mike will be jealous
@iHeartRadio  What was one of the craziest moments you had on stage? #iHeartSWS @SWStheband
@iHeartRadio  What was the idea behind Go Go Go video? #iHeartSWS @SWStheband
@iHeartRadio  What's the best part of being on a tour? #iHeartSWS @SWStheband
@iHeartRadio Who is the most clean in the band? @SWStheband #iHeartSWS
@iHeartRadio Can you describe the mood of the new music video in 3 words? #iHeartSWS @SWStheband
So attractive. 
When you're snapchating everyone that you're going home at 12:30 but then you go home at 1:00 bc of your mum. 
@AndreasLemesios your turn :) 
@AndreasLemesios It's good but I prefer Feels Like Forever by them :)
@ohmyrossum Yeah, same but I wasn't expecting him to die the way he did. It was kinda tragic.
@AndreasLemesios I can't tell because I haven't listened to the song. But Gravity is awesome :)
Vote @paparoach 's Gravity 
@ohmyrossum so heartbreaking and such a shocking death :(
Me every day at school. 
@typicalastrid you're welcome :)
Jealous of that ice-cream. 
Stephanie Hwang is the best haha <HEAVY BLACK HEART> 
My dad is getting on my nerves
@typicalastrid Wow, that's awesome!!
this promo scares me so much 
I just kinda hate Jon Snow now
I'm so glad  Jorah is back. It's time for Daenerys to forgive him.
Still hopes that Grey Worm is still alive but i don't think so. this is game of thrones we're talking about
please tell me that they didn't die 
here we are with the GoT deaths again
I still want I'll Be Gone live
WASTELANDS


can't wait for GoT 5x05 episode
pll has one of the best and true quotes 
Well Will Smith's costume is more badass and more high quality but Michael Rowe looked so scary in his costume.
Excuse me but Michael Rowe is far better Deadshot than Will Smith. 
Aria looks like she's dressed as a vampire for Halloween. That would be a good idea for this year's halloween episode 
They look stunning. Can't wait for s6 premiere. 
Feeling the MADNESS all over again! Love this album <HEAVY BLACK HEART> 
#MADNESS #madnessmonday #sws… 
@Kellinquinn @iHeartRadio What time?
@michaelfjordbak Good :) I hope I didn't sound rediculous or creepy.
@michaelfjordbak I'm kinda constantly checking your Instagram to see if you post something about how the audition went.
Viserys was the hottest in GoT. 
Please tell me I'm not the only one who misses Viserys. 
But I'm not gonna tweet anything about it until tmr bc that would be a spoiler
Today I watched the 4th leaked episode of Game of Thrones and I don't feel that guilty about it.
@jerryhorton Do you watch Game of Thrones?
@jerryhorton Good idea
There needs to be a "bad joke" emoji. 
@michaelfjordbak How did the audition go? I hope it did great!
guys, I want Michael Fjordbak to play Alec Lightwood sooooo bad!
For which season finale do you look more forward to this month?
Love his style. 
listening to girls' generation
Just watched the promo for arrow and omg. The next episode is going to be insane!
@ChesterBe Didn't even notice
@jerryhorton Good night! Do you remember the dreams you have?
@jerryhorton Do you plan playing any song from FEAR in acoustic?
Klaus is such a selfish bastard.
Elena shouldn't have taken the cure. So predictable.
"It's time to get the hell out of this place"
Sehun is my overdose. 
this song drives me crazy 
still can't believe that iris learned that barry is the flash and that dr. wells revealed himself omg
I have this hot mess as my lock screen and I'm dying. 
btw i'm loving eddie's last name "Thawne".
So Eobard is related to Eddie. But how?
I can't believe the stuff that are going on in the flash and in arrow omg.
Just watched the flash 1x20 and I'm so mind-blown.
Wow Barry created that Gideon robot
Watching the flash. Omg that beginning
Aww, Thea learned that Roy is alive.
Nyssa will be the demon's bride? Aka Ollie's. What?
God, I hate Ras al' ghul
Thea is absolutely awesome
I like Nyssa but if she does anything to Ollie...
Watching arrow.
Sehun | Black and White 
E-X-O 
Tiffany is so adorable :3 
She's wonderful #stephaniehwang #tiffany 
@TheJesseLawson Your new icon is amazing. So colorful! Love it xx
Everytime I listen to GG I want to dance my ass off, lol
I've been listening to Girls' Generation and EXO the whole day.
Kai baby. 
Who is into k-pop? I am.
OTP. #HunFany 
"Finn Wittrock as Chap Newton.  A happily engaged man, who out of some bad luck, decides to spend a night at the hotel." doesn't sounds good
This hot mess is back for ahs season 5, fuck yeah. 
I'm so excited for season 5's cast. The only who is missing is Taissa Farmiga. 
#BestFandomCA2015 ELF 
@Kellinquinn Can you reveal to us the song title of the music video?
I love his body. [if you know what I mean] 
Angel. 
@Kellinquinn @AppMeerkat Please try to stream it. That would be awesome!!
Missed the chance. Now I can go to sleep.
@jerryhorton Have an awesome show!
Hot as fuck. 
I need to sleep but how can I when I'm waiting for jerry to answer me?
Oh my. 
@jerryhorton Which song is going to be a music video next? :)
@paparoach @AltPress Will I be greedy if I ask for a BTS part 2? 
Jerry's humor is very similar to Phoenix's. I think they would make an amazing company together.
oops, I haven't watched Got, The Originals and The Flash yet.
focusing on k-pop bands instead of focusing on my finals
@ddoza No, I'm not learning, I was just kidding. Thank you anyway :)
She's not only pretty, she's hot as well. 
Last night at my prom party <SPARKLES>I actually had a great night <VICTORY HAND> 
#selfie #promselfie #promnight #prom… 
@ChesterBe tonight was my prom and it was really great. Can you make my night even more great by replying to me? xx
@ChesterBe You look so pinky. Love you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I'm so glad and grateful that we, the seniors, don't have school tmr bc of the prom night.
My head is spinning and so am I
Now I'm just lying on my bed with my dress and make up on. Tweeting is the only thing keeping me from collapsing right now.
I loved the DJ for putting it
They put It's My Life by Bon Jovi and I acted like I was in a rock concert. Awesome moment.
I wanted to stay a little longer but my sister and a friend wanted to leave
Just came back from the prom at 3am
If it wasn't for those shots I wouldn't have danced that much.
Wow, I danced. A lot.
My feet hurt from the heels but I'm having fun. Thanks to those shots.
I'm at my prom right now and I'm slightly drunk
@thxstrays @Kellinquinn @SWStheband I had the original picture as my homepage! Love it btw <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
I suddenly want to learn Korean. 
Too cool for you. 
I can't handle his perfection <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Tate Langdon | one of my favorite characters ever 
His smile is just perfect. 
#HappyBirthdayPatrickStump 
The beautiful voice of Fall Out Boy #HappyBirthdayPatrickStump 
Happy Birthday to this uniquely awesome voice and to this adorable man. #HappyBirthdayPatrickStump 
She's sooooo cute 
Stephanie Young Hwang [Tiffany] 
Tiffany is so adorable. 
tomorrow night is my prom party, fuck
My King for all of the days. 
Yesterday I went to a book store and this cool cover caught my eye. I read the description and it… 
Sehun is perfection <HEAVY BLACK HEART><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Call Me Baby by EXO is simply awesome.
I don't wanna go to school tmr. I just want to stay home watching k-pop videos.
I'm in love. 
My hot baby <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@TalindaB @ChesterBe That's so Chester <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Owari no Seraph's ending song is absolutely AWESOME!
My morning is starting up right with some LP music videos on youtube
What's your currently favorite show on TV? — Pretty Little Liars &amp; Arrow. 
Hope you had an extremely awesome birthday! Here 2 edits I made for you @Kellinquinn Love you <HEAVY BLACK HEART> xx 
Happy 15th Birthday Infest! Last Resort &amp; Between Angels and Insects are my favorite from this album! 
Tiffany from girls' generation is awesome. 
girls' generation are awesome!
i'm currently obsessed with k-pop thanks to my sis omg
The cure is only for one person, right? I'm confused.
So will Damon take the cure with Elena? Is that possible?
Stefan helped Caroline to turn her humanity on. Aww, I love these two together but as friends only.
Stefan is perfect, I love him so much.
The way Caroline turned her humanity on was so heartbreaking.
I'm so glad Caroline turned her humanity back on and loved how she turned it on
I don't want Nina to leave, I don't want Nina to leave, I don't want Nina to leave *cries*
Just watched tvd.

@Caspar_Lee Will that make you older?
I want every issue of kerrang!
It really hurts me everytime lp announce a m&amp;g because I know I won't be able to go.
I want to see my favorite band live now.
Adorable &amp; crazy. #HappyBirthdayCaspar 
I need to get a kinda flat tummy til Tuesday night when it's my prom.
I feel like not eating anything for the following days.
Happy Birthday to this crazy one  <BIRTHDAY CAKE><PARTY POPPER> #HappyBirthdayCaspar 
You're meeting the fucking WHOLE band, not just one band member, gosh.
Especially when they're meeting the whole band but they're acting like they're meeting their favorite one.
I so hate it when some people focus on  one band member only and they claim that that band it's their favorite. Gosh.
Birthday boy <BIRTHDAY CAKE><PARTY POPPER> #HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 
Happy Birthday @Kellinquinn !Hope you like the 2 edits I made for you.Thank you for being  awesome.Have the best bday 
Perfect as hell.
#HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 
Hotness overload. #HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 
So hot. #HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 

Happy Birthday Bae @Kellinquinn <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS> 
#HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 
I just feel so much love for this man. #HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 
Happy Birthday to the man that spoke to my soul since day one. I love you @Kellinquinn &lt;3 #HappyBirthdayKellinQuinn 
The last mins of the episode literally made my stomach hurt.
"Al sah-him. A heir to the demon." Omg
Can someone tell how can Thea's hair stay completely straight after all of this?
"John, you're the best man I've ever known." Awww, bromance :')
And so did league for assassins
I think team arrow undersrimates league of assassins
I already miss colton in arrow
"I've seen a lot movies to know..." Haha omg felicity <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Wtf did Felicity do to Ollie?
Olicity sex scene should had been a deleted scene.
Olicity sex. Time to start tweeting or scrolling on instagram
Oh fuck, olicity sex is coming. Can they just skip this?
And why is Ra's al ghul opening his heart to a stranger?
To who does felicity think she's talking to? He's freaking Ra's al ghul.
She thinks that Ollie is dead and her mom is alive
Omg Thea has memory issues.
She looks possessed, poor her.
Did Thia turn into a dog?
Omg Akio died. Nooo.
Not-island flashbacks are boring.
Did Felicity cut her hair again?
I tweeted this last time but Ray is amazing and I love him.
Watching arrow.
Having such a boring day
Haven't watched arrow yet and it's almost 10pm
So this issue of Kerrang! arrived in the mail yesterday and it's literally awesome. It was so fun… 
@KerrangMagazine @paparoach @MariaBrink It's such a kick-ass video. Love how the video's mood matches the mood of the song <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@TheJesseLawson Can you reveal to us the title of the song's music video? :)
So officially Dr. Wells is not Dr. Wells
Omg Barry, Caitlin and Cisco discovered Dr. Wells' secret place.
Just watched the flash! It was awesome!
@jerryhorton the Gravity video is such a kick-ass video. Loved it <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Watching the flash
@nodirectionhome Hey :) When is the next music video coming out?
I've been waiting for this video for so long. And it's finally here!
Just woke up from my nap to see that Gravity video by Papa Roach was out. I've been waiting all day for it. It's awesome.
I hope someone will soon upload the LPU Chat with Brad on youtube
@sandpaper_tears yeah, I know but I'm sure he doesn't even care :)
I'm not sure if I like Chester's new hair color or not but I think it looks hot so I guess I like it :) 
@paparoach Can't freaking wait! I'm sure I won't stop hitting the replay button once it's out :)
Michael Fjordbak would make a perfect Alec Lightwood. 
I think none can play Clary except from the wonderful Lily Collins.
But they did a great choice choosing Dominic Sherwood for Jace and I'm so excited!
I'm so nervous about who the cast is going to be for TMI series.
@ChesterBe How did you decide to go blond again? :)
This year I have been very lucky with getting noticed by the members of LP. I just hope I'll be lucky seeing them live this year or the next
Now every single member of linkin park has answered me to at least one of my questions except Phoenix. Need to win Phoenix.
Brad was just perfect on the LPU Chat. I don't even know how many times he made me laugh with his awesome humor! 
Brad answered one of my questions on today's LPU Chat and I'm so extremely happy about that. *fangirling*
@ChesterBe What's that? Someone please fill me in.
@ChesterBe How did you decide to go blond again? :) And how's your leg?
@ChesterBe Blond hair is hot. Glad you brought it back after so many years. Everything suits you so well x
@Joe_Sugg hi Joe! How did the snowboarding go? :)
@MarcusButler Is something bothering you Marcus? x 
I want to learn rapping High Voltage by LP but it's soooo hard.
but no, i have to study... bye
i just want to watch youtube videos and some anime right now.
not ready for school
fuck, i need to study for a "back-to-school" test for tmr
What are you expecting from the new season of "Game o... — A lot of unexpected and shocking deaths as always. Th... 
Lmao this is hilarious!! 
Always head-banging when listening to Keys To The Kingdom. Even when I have a headache.
When I thought I got lucky with one black dress, I found out that it was XS. Perfect. Too bad because it was stunning.
I also tried on a pink beautiful dress but it was so ugly on me so obvs I didn't buy it.
I hope they have it on my size. Please have it on my size.
I found a black dress from topshop which was amazing but it was too big. I need to go later to the other topshop near me to search for it
Earlier I went for a prom-dress hunting and it didn't go well.
It's a concealer stick and it's perfection. It even smells good.
I just bought a new concealer and I'm lovin' it.
@bogdanova1353 @ChesterBe @mikeshinoda @linkinpark Haha omg that's amazing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Seeing @joehahnLP talking at Star Wars Celebration made my night even though I caught him for a few mins. 
Watching tvd
Poor Eddie, he cannot talk. He can't reveal nothing about the flash. But I think he will. If he talks to her, he's dead by Joe.
It looks like Iris is trying to find an excuse to break up with Eddie.
I don't want Iris to break up with Eddie. She's so stubborn.
Which movie do you think is overrated? — Titanic. Definitely Titanic. 
the flash is awesome
barry really loves iris aww
barry + felicity. i ship it
haha felicity is adorable "bee-careful"
ahhh someone is jealous &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; barry
that the flash's car scene was EXACTLY like teen wolf's car scene bee attack
having that mask on my face again
@iTunesMusic Who decided to rename the song from Horizons to Darker Than Blood and why? #AskSteveAndMike @mikeshinoda @steveaoki @linkinpark
@iTunesMusic Who is the most stylish? #AskSteveAndMike @mikeshinoda @steveaoki @linkinpark
@iTunesMusic Favorite lyric line from Darker Than Blood or A Light That Never Comes? #AskSteveAndMike @mikeshinoda @steveaoki @linkinpark
@iTunesMusic Will @mikeshinoda finally join snapchat? Please convince him @steveaoki #AskSteveAndMike @linkinpark
@iTunesMusic Who is likely to jump higher? (on stage or not) @mikeshinoda @steveaoki @linkinpark #AskSteveAndMike
@iTunesMusic I like how this sounds.
#AskSteveAndMike <CRYSTAL BALL>
@iTunesMusic Awesome!!
@iTunesMusic How did you decide to rename Horizons to Darker Than Blood? #AskSteveAndMike @mikeshinoda @steveaoki @linkinpark
@iTunesMusic @m_shinoda @steveaoki Can you both describe Darker Than Blood video in 1 word? (please give different words) #AskSteveAndMike
@folieacookie no prob! basically I LOVE your hair color :)
@folieacookie You look cute and so does your hair :)
@CandiceAccola I love you xx
@paparoach Is there teaser #3 too?
#tbt to summer 2012 in Greece. One of the best summer I have ever had. Can't wait for summer 2015… 
@paparoach @JacobyShaddix But he is <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Can @mikeshinoda please favorite one of my tweets or should I wait for the Q&amp;A later?
@mikeshinoda Do you watch Arrow?
@mikeshinoda Try at Target.
I will always remember that lip bite. 
omg, I didn't know Tyler Blackburn could sing. Why am I watching this for the first time? 
Treegan/Spoby. They're so awesome. 
@Camila21Echelon you mean his, lol. nothing affects jared's beauty
@TVDvampirelove hope she will stay long. I like her
It should be illegal to put someone that hot in jail. 
I have to catch up with The Flash and The Originals
@Camila21Echelon he still looks handsome omg
@TheJesseLawson I think we're more excited xD Have you chosen the album cover yet?
@TVDvampirelove Thought the same. I think they did a great job choosing her as mama Salvatore.
@roozaliin ikr? so heartbreaking.
@shailenybeanie I wanna know her secret!
@Camila21Echelon hahahaha, the lips. i'm crying.
If writers make elena take the cure and die or something like that it will be so low quality.
I'm sure they're (the writers) gonna kill Elena off by making her take the cure.
I think they will cancel tvd after season 7's first 10 episodes. That's what I want.
Nina Dobrev leaves tvd. Michael Trevino leaves tvd and now Colton Haynes leaves arrow. great
"and the show wouldn’t be the show it is without him." [without Colton] true. I wouldn't have watched arrow if it wasn't for colton.
Good bye Roy Harper, we will miss you.
- to clear things out
to those who haven't watched the arrow ep yet: 1) get a lot of tissues next to you 2) right after watching go see the promo for the next ep
My heart still aches and my eyes are still kinda swollen. Thanks a lot arrow.

Season 3 of arrow will be the death of me. I'm already close to it.
Hope he comes back in season 4, please bring him back.
It's going to be a great loss in arrow team with Roy gone.
I'm definitely not ready for Arrow's next 4 episodes but thanks to the latest episode for tearing my heart apart twice.
but some really serious shit are going to happen in the next episode
just watched the promo for 3x20 thank god thea didn't die
I JUST CRIED TWICE BC I THOUGH ROY DIED AND THEN THIA.
*SPOILERS FOR ARROW DON'T READ MY FOLLOWING TWEET IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED YET*
I can't breathe from crying
Ray baby you're perfect!
Oh gosh he got her again
Meta-human: Where were we?
Felicity: Waiting for you to come closer.
*phsh* *escapes from his grip*
I really miss island's flashbacks. These ones (out of the island) are pretty boring.
Ray is so adorable I love him.
It's so heartbreaking seeing Roy in jail. 
I don't want to watch the olicity sex scene (fanservice)eww. I'd like to skip it but I'm not a skipper. I'll just stay away from the screen.
I think it's time to watch arrow but I have a feeling it would be a sad episode and i'm scared
No doubts about papa roach's gravity video. I'm sure it's gonna kick ass.
That looks awesome. I no longer doubt that the video would be as badass as the song! @paparoach 
He's just too hot. I'm on fire. 
@nodirectionhome Keep on voting cause you totally deserve all the madness!
I'm sure she unfollowed me bc I was spamming her TL with #VoteTrisMTV but I'm not sorry at all for voting that much those days.
So I just saw that an account which was following me for 2 years or so, unfollowed me and it kinda breaks my heart.
The only songs that I don't like are November and Madness.
Madness is awesome and it makes my heart fly.
But I'm going to a cafeteria with my sis. That's good bc I got all dressed up and ready.
Fuck I'm not going bc if I go in 10 mins I will only go for half an hour
This will sound weird but I don't wanna miss my math class today but I'm already losing it bc I don't have someone to drive me there.
@dobrevsmagic I haven't watched last night's episode yet but maybe it is.
I am Daenerys Targaryen, mother of dragons. 
I got: Daenerys Targaryen!  
@dobrevsmagic omg hope it's not true
@dobrevsmagic wait Colton is leaving Arrow?
Kol is so badass. I miss him. 
This is hilarious. Lucy's eyebrows.

I mean it's such a badass song. It has to turn into a badass music video too.
Just learned that Gravity music video will be a low budget video and I'm worried.

@PointlessBlog I'm still in bed too but I don't have a Glasgow meet up.
#VoteTrisMTV she have had a huge strength and character development
#VoteTrisMTV She's a warrior
This just made my morning! #VoteTrisMTV 
#WeWillMissYouNina 
In season 6 we will lose Elena Gilbert meaning that Nina …
@ChesterPaws yeah but they don't do it bc they want more people to listen to them. if that was the case THP would have aoki's sound
meanwhile... 
Thomas Best hero ? Excuse you, you meant Tris Prior. #VoteTrisMTV
#VoteTrisMTV best hero, super hero, whatever you want to call it, she's THE hero
#VoteTrisMtv Beatris Prior = hero
this is kinda unfair bc not everyone has a twitter 
#VoteTrisMTV She's dauntless, selfless, intelligent, peaceful, honest.... She's DIVERGENT.
#VoteTrisMTV She's dauntless, duh? Isn't that enough?
#VoteTrisMTV she's selfless (hence she once belonged in abnegation) and always tries to do the best for the others
#VoteTrisMTV She's lost everything but she keeps going
#VoteTrisMTV talk about that girl power
#VoteTrisMTV because she's the f*cking best hero

I #VoteTrisMTV for Best Hero! Watch the @MTV #movieawards on April 12 starting at 7:30 ET to see who wins! 
best villain is ofc rosamund pike

best duo is ofc shailene &amp; ansel 
to be honest i want to vote rosamund pike in all categories nominated bc she deserves an oscar for that psycho role.
sorry but I had to vote rosamund pike from gone girl over dylan o'brien for best scared as shit performance.
@kap_awg yeah, same! it's amazing!
originals left
jeremy left
tyler is leaving
liz died
kol died
kai is leaving
elena is leaving

me: 
This makes me emotional. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@ChesterPaws it's just a collaboration
@kap_awg i had this song stuck in my mind the whole day
benzo33 
@dxlphinecormier my mom does exactly the same almost every night
so shailene can wear a wig for another movie but not for insurgent? ugh
vote for Breaking Benjamin's amazing song, Failure &lt;3 
they'd better have a super awesome plot planned in s7 because none would want to see tvd without nina
tvd is going to suck more without nina
@mikeshinoda wish you would shoot another music video from THP
So sad.... 
want to buy this but it's kinda expensive for a hat 
i'm such a slow eater when it comes to carrot
when is my skin going to be flawless? ugh
Nina was one of the first reasons I loved tvd so much.
I can take Michael's and Steven's departure since they're not that main but I cannot take Nina's
I may hate Elena sometimes but i can't imagine the series without her role.
I thought that it was just a series finale for tvd but then I learned that tvd doesn't end but Nina does leave. And that's worst.
So Nina is leaving TVD. Great *definitely not*

I Am Machine and Painkiller are pretty awesome though. They're that kind of songs that stuck in your mind from the first listening.
i'm not that disappointed though bc i wasn't expecting much
the really good tracks are very few
Listening to 3DG's new album and idk it's so plain
Hahaha I love her <HEAVY BLACK HEART><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Best line ever. 
She's so cute omg I can't <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
Learning how to pronounce "shocking truth" 
Hitsugi no chaika's 1st opening has stuck in my mind
Vote The Hunting Party by @linkinpark for Album of the Year now! 
i've been watching hitsugi no chaika almost the whole day, i'm obsessed
Can I have an asian skin type please?
Jesse RTed my tweet and I'm so happy <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@JoshGuerra13 @TheJesseLawson @kjellyy @ATXUnderground @YouTube Love watching interviews of you Jesse!
@TheJesseLawson What are your plans for the Easter holidays? :)
"shocking truth" will be my new favorite phrase
Quote: "Shocking truth!" hahaha omg. 
Fly by sws is just perfection! #madness
"I wanna fly and put back all the pieces of this broken heart tonight."
"It's just the way it goes."
now that michelle phan isn't putting any make up tutorial vids idk what make up vids i should watch bc she's the best&amp;i have high standards
Hitsugi no chaike reminds me akame ga kill so much. Especially the opening song sounds so alike.
going to watch one more episode for now and then chill on tumblr
chaika is so kawaii omg i love her
i'm currently obsessed with Hitsugi no Chaika. such an amazing anime
@ChesterBe Awesome! How's your ankle?
@TheJesseLawson It's in your blood :)
Saturdays.
#coffee #cafeteria #chillin #saturdays #weekend #itstheweekend #outwithfriends #cappuccino… 
"Could you be my heroine?"
Kellin's voice is life.
Such a nice surprise to see on snapchat news feed MTV <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
I'm so thirsty but I'm on my bed ready to sleep so I can't stand up again. Feel my struggle?
@LLblackCanary they're so delusional
@actual_eren obviously don't
@actual_eren *feeling nostalgic*
I will always miss Jesse from sws and Adam from 3dg.
Colton's facial hair = extremely attractive 
@LLblackCanary the way he looks at her kills me <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
*CRIES FOREVER* 
@MesticWesley meant to be

I met a girl ... 
@actual_eren oh gosh
@actual_eren he's just so strong and brave!
I dislike this ship almost as much as I dislike delena.
So sick of seeing Olicity posts on my TL.
I'm lying on the couch watching TV but my mom won't stop snoring. Ugh, hate this.
@Caspar_Lee so mean
I already miss Death Parade :/
Love this footer so much. 
@phoenixlp @ringostarrmusic @ConanOBrien Under the shirt. Just like superman.
@steveaoki @linkinpark Sounds creepy :)
Throwback to last summer, reading Learning Not To Drown by @annashinoda <SPARKLES> I really miss those summer… 
Shado's twin though
Akio is so cute <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
I now hate Maseo.
"This only ends one way." What?
Can we talk about how much roy looked in that promo?
Roy being in jail is so heartbreaking.
Out of the blue olicity will have sex in the next episode.
I feel like arrow's writers are obeying olicity's fans cravings aka fan service.
Sweet Felicity is going to cheat on Roy with Oliver. So nice of her.
Felicity's mom is awesome <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Roy is willing to sacrifice himself in order to save Oliver. True loyalty.
Arrow 3x18 left me speechless.
"You got the wrong guy. Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow. I am." Omg Roy.
Sara is making Nyssa a better person even now that she's dead.
Am I the only one who thinks that new band 'as it is', is way too overrated? Idk.
Me in the class. 
i really can't imagine teen wolf without derek. i mean who does?
Tyler Hoechlin leaving Teen Wolf is heartbreaking news.
i would like to see dylan as spiderman but i don't want him to leave teen wolf. there would be no teen wolf without him.
1st, he looks so damn hot. 2nd wtf is going on? why's everyone leaving teen wolf? so sad &amp; pissed at the same time.

Had a long day. Time to sleep. Good night x
My April-fool prank to one of best friends was a great succeed though
My previous tweets was just a joke in case you didn't get it. I'm such a failure in April Fools.
Hahaha omg Idk what I'm doing.I'm trying to april-fool my followers but I'm doing it completly wrong it feels like I'm lying.I'm stopping it
I have now lost my faith in friendship. The worsts are yet to come.
Great now I'm grounded for a week
One of my best friends just betrayed me bc she told my parents. I'm sure it's bc she's jealous af
My parents won't let me go out tonight and that's why I'm sneaking out.
I wish I could just disappear.
Spending April Fools' morning @ Starbucks trying to come up with some good pranks. 
#starbucks… 
Leto brothers on snapchat <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@jerryhorton or drink and drive
@BadyBennington exactly <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I don't want many things in my life. Just to marry some band members and actors.
@BadyBennington no words...
Saw this in public and tried not to pass out. His body is amazing <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@ChesterBe @MusicForRelief and who will save Joe?
We Believe In Oliver Queen because he survives everything. Even death. 
We Believe In Oliver Queen because he's fucking Oliver Queen.
@Caspar_Lee @xXKyleCruzXx @Joe_Sugg @OliWhiteTV yeah, I mean he has a girlfriend, right?
@JaredLeto So glad you're feeling better! That means we get to hear your voice on snapchat soon? ;) x
haters everywhere
Sometimes shailene get on my nerves too but I won't go on twitter being disrespectful to her and her fans.
I hate seeing disrespectful people and that's why I unfollowed one of my followers.
That Sinclair witch is back to devour more kids/teens' powers you psycho bitch.
Need to catch up with one episode of The Originals.
Sounds so Elijah. 
@danieljgillies well said <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
I don't ship Elijah with Zia at all. Like ewww.
King Kellin Quinn Bostwick of the kingdom Sirens.

Not enough sleep.
Such a nice movie. Time to sleep cause I won't be waking up tmr
Watching Face Off on TV but I need to sleep.
I don't know which scares me the most. Nicholas Cage's movies or Nicholas Cage in general.
How did Linkin Park never had a photoshoot at a park?
"I don't want to destroy life. Remember."
Omg, he finally smiled and it suits him well. 
Btw, this year was the last time I made birthday videos for Linkin Park.
Thank you for 220 subscribers and 115,300+ views! Once I'm exam-free, I'm going to make more videos. 
@MrsCelebration Was it the first time you saw him? I love it too! Oh, that Chester's hotness *_*
If you think Death Parade's ending song is awesome, full song is 124579 times more awesome.
I would die just to be in Decim's arms!
@Daanishhhhh Pretty Little Liars
Now I have 3 things that I will be unable to stop thinking. PLL, Tokyo Ghoul, Death Parade *yay*
Death Parade's full ending song was deleted from youtube but thankfully I downloaded it before it got deleted so now I have it on repeat!
I want Death Parade season 2 :'(
Welcome back @ChesterBe ! Your voice sounds amazing. Wish I was there x 

@MrsCelebration Omg, wow! I would be unable to breathe. Did his hair grow that long btw, lol?
If you could pick an eye color what would you choose? — Lily Collins' eye color. 
@MrsCelebration Lucky! Glad he's doing okay :)
@TheJesseLawson Love you Jesse <HEAVY BLACK HEART> You should upload a video on YouTube talking or something because I miss seeing you talking xx
Coffee makes me want to take selfies.
#selfie #coffee #coffeeinfluence #shoppingday #lpbeanie #beanie… 
Hope u like the little edit I made for We Like It Loud @Kellinquinn @gabebarham @JackSWS @JustinNFJK @nodirectionhome 
Listening to death parade's full ending song (last theater by noicecell) and can't help but cry
Death Parade's ending song is literally the best.

decim is awesome. i knew he had had human feelings.
omg just watched death parade's finale and my heart aches
i'm gonna cry a lot. i'm sure.
going to watch death parade's last episode
@ChesterBe Are you considering doing a LPU Video Chat anytime soon?
@ArpitMD True :)
@ChesterBe Glad you had a great time :) How are you feeling?x
In love with his smile. 
kellin's back &lt;3 
hahaaha omg ian!

this post is hillarious!

he's so adorable 
I want concert tickets to see my boyfriend, please. 
Starbuck's history. 
#starbucks #history #caramelmacchiato #maplesyrup #caramelsyrup #caramel #coffee… 
kellin is the best and the worst employee 
next episode is going to be a chaos 
maseo looked pretty hot in the arrow suit though 
too bad because i liked him. now he's acting like an ass.
maseo has crossed the line.
that episode was one of the few where we didn't get a flashback about oli
layla is awesome, i love her
i mean he had killed people, killed diggle's brother but he had grown into a better person
it was so sad when floyd lawton died.
what amazing episode was 3x17 of arrow. loved it!
I'm glad Barry knows about him rn
Dr. Wells really confuses me
Cold is such an asshole but I like him
aww, cisco's relationship with his brother was really touching
i'm team eddie on that btw
he just rushed because he was over-excited
nor did he take into consideration his friendship with eddie
he didn't even take into consideration how awkward he would make her feel
barry just because saw the future he thought that it was that easy getting the girl, aka iris. he was wrong
i liked it when eddie punched barry. he had every right to react like that!
he looked pretty angry though, you can't blame barry for thinking he was going to get a punch 
barry's face when he thought eddie was coming to punch him again is just priceless 
barry's face when he thought eddie was coming to punch him again, lmao
also, i'm glad joe and cisco stayed safe
i'm so glad that barry didn't kiss iris and iris didn't cheat on eddie (in present at least)
this series is getting more and more awesome
just watched the flash omg
Reading pll 'A' theories, aka Charles, late at night, wasn't a good idea.
@_GhostCat_x yeah...
@_GhostCat_x yeah but many people died along with him :/
Me after watching Tokyo Ghoul Root √A finale. 
@_GhostCat_x he just didn't take into consideration the situation right.
@_GhostCat_x I honestly had hope for Tatsumi bc he was getting better and better.
@_GhostCat_x I couldn't help it
I had only heard that in this anime many people die, just like game of thrones.didn't expect EVERYONE to die
@_GhostCat_x I was so glad she killed her. I hated that bitch. I can't choose the saddest death bc I cried my eyes out to everyone's death.
Need to catch up with 1 episode of Arrow, 1 ep of The Flash, 2 eps of The Originals.
@_GhostCat_x haha, I feel you. Akame and the boss were the only survivors. Everyone else died and it just broke my heart.
@_GhostCat_x no prob x She's so awesome! One of my favs<HEAVY BLACK HEART>
going to put unravel with taking a showers and try not to cry again.
@_GhostCat_x your icon is perfection!
I'm never gonna be able to listen to Unravel again.
Okay yeah. Done.
I died when the acoustic version of Unravel by TK played on season finale's episode.

i personally loved the finale
My sis is reading the manga and she said that the episode sucked compared to the manga. That's why I'm not reading "on-going's anime", manga
Tokyo Ghoul's last episode was so heartbreaking. My heart broke into a million pieces.
Hide :'( Why did he have to die?
just watched tokyo ghoul. i ofc cried my eyes out as expected
I'm already having a headache. Imagine how worse I'm going to be after watching tokyo ghoul's finale.
Ready to cry my eyes out. #tokyoghouls2finale #TokyoGhoulRootA
Omg, Dr. Wells is Eddie's brother!?
Iris cheated on Eddie. Bitch.
When they kissed i was like ewww
I don't ship Barry with Iris AT ALL!
Just watched the flash 1x16 omg
Fly by sws is so awesome. I love it!
just listened to three days grace's new song "human race". i didn't like it at all. it doesn't sound like 3dg at all.
there are already some theories out
i've been thinking pll the whole day.
This is how my hair looked like. Well, not that flawless but good enough. 
I really hoped there would be some of the cast, especially a hot one so I curled my hair to make it look flawless for nothing.
The rest of us, who were the majority, went around the area for a walk. It was a lot of fun.
Some of my classmates had certainly more fun because they shot a small scene parody of the series. Nothing professional ofc.
It was kinda cool because the place was so small but on tv they make it look like a big place.
So we just went there and did nothing but staring.
So my group went to a traditional cafeteria where they shoot a TV series but there was no cast or crew since it was not a shooting day.
We only had 4 classes because it was Association/Group Day where each bough goes to a destination related to the group's subject.
It's been a really nice day today.
With A watching them from very close.
I can't sleep just because I have a freaking math test. Imagine how the girls must be feeling in that creepy dollhouse.
Reading Chester's lpu letter before going to bed wasn't a good idea as I got all emotional.
This will sound weird but I like Chester's 'd'. 
@slippin_around Ikr? <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> The feeling you're getting from it it's just indescribable.
Basically I never really believed she died.
I wasn't that shocked that Mona was alive because I was kinda suspecting it lately.
Meteora artwork. 
'A' is so sick. Having the girls in a dollhouse, keeping them in identical bedrooms to their own bedrooms? Who would have thought of this?
everything about the dollhouse creeps me out.
I mean it's a girl thing. A mean girl's thing.... wanting to destroy a girl's life.
How can a guy be overly jealous with so many girls?
I was sure A was a jealous bitch, aka girl but no. They ruined it for me. It's a guy. Ugh.
btw i really wanted (still want) A to be Maya. I had read a great theory which makes so much sense.
now i'm looking forward to new pll theories by people
pll's season finale got me with a heart attack.
I will never stop feeling the way I do about Linkin Park.
"If I could change, I would. Take back the pain, I would. Retrace every wrong move that I made, I would."
this song is so awesome and at the same time heartbreaking. i want to cry. 
This was soooo me in pll's finale. 
Only in PLL. 
I don't want A to be a man. fuck fuck fuck
I'm so proud to call this band my favorite one. 
Meteora Photoshoot | Perfection 
Perfect lyrics,perfect music,perfect vocals/ rap. Everything's perfect about this album #Happy12thBirthdayMeteora 
That beautiful smile! I want to see his beautiful eyes too. 

my heart beat it's kinda fast rn, thanks pll.
But I really liked the episode it was amazing
Just watched pll's finale and I'm so pissed at Marlene King. She's the biggest liar. #sorrynotsorry
She's so beautiful <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@marga_santos8 it's worth the waiting :)
Going to sleep after an exhausting day. My feet hurts.
@marga_santos8 it's amazing!
But I will be studying for a math test. *sad face*
Tomorrow i don't have school yay!
steroline friendship it's gone because the writers ruined it.
i hope steroline shippers are happy that their ship just had sex with their humanity off
why are they bringing 'the cure game' back? it's so tiring.
yeah, right. why on earth would damon want to be human again?
Caroline is good even without humanity.
gosh he's so hot
Kai is so cute now that he's personality is affected by Luke's.
it better be as good as the cast claims it to be.
i'm really nervous about pll season finale.
omg tonight it's the pll season finale omg
Do you like long hair or short hair better on others? — Well, I like long hair for me so I guess that goes for o... 
@linkinpark Thank you for making it happen! It was awesome :)
And he smiled and said to me "I see where you're going with this." I'm dead!!
ROB ANSWERED TO ME OMG. HE ANSWERED MY QUESTION COMPLETELY.
i video recorded rob's video chat from the pc but i forgot to turn the microphone off so you can hear me in the back laughing and fangirling
omg breaking benjamin's new song is awesome!!
Listening to BB's new song and I'm about to cry.

@LPUsCDizzle205 omg, going to check BB's new song now!
always kinda stressed before an LPU Video Chat. that means i'm going to have a heart attack when the time comes to meet them.
hope he answers at least one of my questions
this is the first i'll be having any connection with rob!!
i have already prepared my questions for him, i can't wait
getting ready for LPU Video Chat with Rob.
Jared's drawing skills are killing me<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> 
this gives me life.

Flawless. 
Last night I watched Insurgent and I expected it to be pretty boring just like the book but it turned… 
Now Ripper Stefan is repeating all over again.
But it was touching that he was willing to sucrifice himself for Sarah.
Ugh, why tvd is repeating its previous seasons?
Guess what? Stefan shut his humanity off. Again.
Hope I'm going to dream chester<FACE THROWING A KISS>
I'm almost 20 hours awake. I guess that means I have to sleep.
Even if it's against the rules.
But I think she's going to the void because she took her own life?! But, but. Isn't there something Decim can do?
Ugh, oh. Chiyuki's judgement has come. Please don't let her get lost into the void. It will be so heartbreaking. Both for Decim and me.
They are now dummies omg
No! Why that fangirl and the star she admired went to the void?
I don't want death parade to end. It's such an amazing anime...
That death parade episode devasted me and the last one is going to devastate me even more.
i hate that creepy old man
if chiyuki had met decim in real life, things would have been so much different.
i don't like the fact that chiyuki had taken her own life. i thought she was a fighter.
"I truly am glad to have met you, Miss Chiyuki." my heart... i want them together.
ahh, i love decim
fuck, i'm hungry
omg, i just died. thank you mike.

omg, last episode's title it's "ken"
I only like Eto when she's that writer and she's not that psycho bitch.
I hate that bitch Eto even though she's Yoshimura's daughter.
if amon is dead, my heart will break!
omg noooooo. i hope amon it's not dead but that what they let us think but we don't know for sure. (please don't spoil me)
"Yo, Kaneki." I love their friendship. Just hug already.
omg, kaneki's reunion with Hide at the end... so many feels
Touka should learn not to wear shorts on a snowy day.
the second own is like a little bitch. more like huge bitch.
i secretly ship amon with kaneki, lol
shinohara shouldn't have died
time to watch tokyo ghoul xx
@Mogggl So am I &lt;3
@Mogggl Chester not only screams, but he raps too which is pretty awesome and aggressive!
@Mogggl Phew, I was kinda too stressed about how this video was going to turn out. Blackout is perfection and i love it so much because -
@Mogggl Thank you! I made it very quickly/rashly since I was super busy but I'm glad you like it :)
@Mogggl Yeah, I could but I have to save money for college too. Plus, my parent's won't let me yet.
Chester's voice is earporn and you can't deny it.
@Mogggl well, it's not okay because i have been dying to see them but i have to stay patient.
@Mogggl Omg, you're so freaking lucky you're getting to see them again!! I have never seen them live and I hate it.
@Mogggl and i'm guessing you're attending one of this shows, right? i hate you!!
@linkinpark Yes, yes, yes, yes!! Can't wait for Monday :)
Details: 
@mikeshinoda Who do you think will win the birthday challenge? Chester or Joe?
Chester's gift it's not only his anger but (mostly) his voice. 

(got it?)
Chester should feel way too pleased with himself since he has the best voice ever but instead he's one of the most down to earth people.
I feel that connection. 
#HappyBirthdayChesterBennington 
wish chester was online so i could wish him happy bday and get a chance to get noticed  x
Thank you for sharing your gift (voice) with us and thank you for being so inspiring. Wish you the best @ChesterBe xx

Happy Birthday to the one&amp; only Chester Bennington I'm so proud to call him my idol. #HappyBirthdayChesterBennington 
This angel has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard &amp; the most beautiful heart. #happybirthdaychesterbennington 
I have now edited 1 minute of the video. I'm gonna do the rest tmr cause I'm pretty tired right and I gotta sleep.
The video I'm making for Chester's birthday will be 4 minutes long. Oops, I edited too many clips.
@ChesterBe How do you feel that tomorrow is your birthday? :)
editing chester's bday video
Shannon Leto being extremely hot. 
Starbucks is love<SPARKLES> 
#caramelmacchiato #maplesyrup #starbucks #starbucksislove #coffee #macchiato…

I just couldn't resist and meme-d this. 
I can't describe how much adorable she is.

@linkinpark @KerrangMagazine I voted for In The End.I was planning on voting for Final Masquerade but I didn't know I couldn't vote again
Vote here: 
this is the third time making a bday video for chester. hope it turns out as good as the previous ones.
so many videos to cut for chester's bday
chester bennington is a hot mess.
Have I ever mentioned that I hate Tanner?
Girls getting arrested was the biggest failure of the episode.
"I remember praying…to God…and asking him to giving me the ability to make music so I could impress girls." - Kellin Quinn
i think they're just going to mess with us like they did on last season's finale
i don't think they're gonna reveal who A is. I don't trust Marlene King.
pll's season 5 finale looks crazy
I felt sorry for Alison in this episode... I almost cried when they announced that she's guilty.
The other 3 liars were arrested too. Like it wasn't heartbreaking enough seeing Hanna in prison.
wtf happened to last night's pll episode? omg...
just watched pll and wtf?
Have you guys heard Madness? What do you think? 

(Photo: grizzleemartin) 
Love them <PURPLE HEART> 
Wish I had a job like Stryker's. 
@TedStryker Sleeping With Sirens <PURPLE HEART>
Madness. 
Wish Kellin had snapchat. 
Kellin on Tal Cooperman's snapchat. (tallywood1) 
Having a terrible headache. Again.
@Frgt10_Anthem @mikeshinoda @ChesterBe I did cry, to be honest.
Today a girl in my class saw Kellin on my homepage and said "His face kinda look weird." And I though in my mind "YOUR face look weird"
I love 'Fly'
Better Off Dead is really amazing.
@Kellinquinn Which song is going to be the next music video?
Kick Me is the best track on the album.
So disappointed.
'Feel' was waaaaaay better.
There's literally only TWO heavy songs. Come on SWS...I'm disappointed ;/
Listening to the last track of Madness, "Don't Say Anything"
Hearing the track name Madness I expected something really intense but this is so boring
and it's pretty boring.
I don't like the track Madness. It's anything but madness.
they're good but soft and i thought they said this album would be heavier than feel.
kick me and we like it out are the only heavy ones so far
why are all the songs soft?
listening to madness by sleeping with sirens
@TIband Really amazing :)
school's theater performance tmr. gonna be boring.
going to sleep. I'm exhausted. good thing tmr morning that I don't have English class bc the teacher will be away.
It's also Madness' release date by SWS and I'm excited to hear it but I will be sad because of the day.
Tomorrow is going to be one month since my beloved grandfather died.
jesse's screams are perfection. miss them.
so i will leave it for tmr
was planning to watch death parade tonight but it's just too late for it now and i won't be focused while watching cause i'm sleepy
chester's laugh is life
cutting clips for chester's bday video at 11:22 am cause i can. well at least trying to cause his bday it's on friday and i have no time.
started making chester's bday video
give some credits to the rest of the band too because without any of them, there wouldn't be a band.
especially when it's a favorite band of yours.
i mean it's normal to admire a band member little more or way more than the other but it's such a shame not giving attention to the other -
i hate it when some fans ignore the other band members and they just focus their attention on the one they admire most.
remember when i didn't like gold by sws at first? now i love it!!
These two notifications make me happy. Going to watch the brand new LPTV now! :) 
That Shinoda laugh though. 
Shipname: Shinelson or Delnoda? 
I started liking Gold by sws and I'm so glad <SPARKLES>

@zwierz Thank you so much! I appreciate it :)
@zwierz This remix is awesome! Can I use it for a video I'm making for Joe's birthday? I'll definitely give credits. 
addicted to flyleaf's all around me &amp; set me on fire
it's pretty late (3:12am) so i have to go to sleep if i want to wake up early tmr.
she's so adorable 
tmr i have to wake up early so i will be able to finish joe's bday video in time
@Kellinquinn It depends, are you having dinner at Hogwarts?
i hate me for not having finished joe's bday video yet.
I would pass out if kellin quinn followed me on instagram (or anywhere)
i'm on instagram seeing band members following their fans and commenting on their posts and i'm just here dying of jealousy
@LinkinParkFOB cool makeup!
can ask.fm stop asking stupid questions?
am I the only one who thinks that the name "hopeless records" is kinda funny for a record company?
adorable. 

Happy Birthday to this cutie pie and perfect actor. #HappyBirthdayAnselElgort 
So easy for him. #HappyBirthdayDanielGillies 
why movie maker? why?
Tonight's dinner: Chilli Beef Ramen <STEAMING BOWL>

@jerryhorton Morning! I started it by listening to F.E.A.R so now I know it's going to be a good morning/day <WHITE SMILING FACE>
i want gravity music video by papa roach now
it's 2:05 am and i'm hungry
addicted. 

#LoveLustTour #MarsInRussia 
@30SECONDSTOMARS 
i have to say that i'm kinda disappointed in madness by sws so far
I really can't take Fear Hate Love off my head. I guess I'm in love with it lol
one hundred sleepless nights by pierce the veil is perfect
@JacobyShaddix Awesome!
my heart broke when i watched this. from this moment i started shipping them for real. 
curious to see ian's directing
no time to watch tvd today, i'm going to watch it tmr morning hopefully
phinoda is real! 

fear hate love has stuck in my mind. so addictive.
Kaneki Ken = perfection 
Rize reaper. 
i mean, ofc, manga comes first but they improved her character design soooo much on the anime.
rize is supposed to look creepy as hell and they succeeded in making her look creepy on the anime but not on the manga.
i would love to cosplay rize but her clothes suck, lol
i need to start reading tokyo ghoul manga but i don't like the manga character design of touka and rize
my top 3 anime are shingeki no kyojin, death note, tokyo ghoul.
tell me why tokyo ghoul is so perfect.
i just watched tokyo ghoul and it was perfection. one of the best of this season.
No words. 
@jerryhorton I really wish I was there :(
but I'm happy because Jesse noticed me twice today.
and now I'm sleepy and lazy as hell.
I was too tired to watch tokyo ghoul so I didn't.
He always know how to put a big smile on my face <HEAVY BLACK HEART> 
#tbt to when I first heard this amazing record by @thejesselawson ! I love it so much. Clear &amp; Loud… 
going to take a bath and then watch my love tokyo ghoul
@danisnotonfire Loved it! Thanks for sharing :)
flyleaf kind of reminds me of paramore and evanescence
i have heard 3 songs by them so far and i loved them
i think flyleaf is a band that makes an addictive music
wow, flyleaf are actually awesome!
@SWStheband <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
that bird again singing that characteristic melody
the very final scene on pll last night's episode made me cringe
i'm so tired of people insisting that one of the liars it's 'A'. it's not. get over of that stupid theory.
go go go by sleeping with sirens has stuck in my mind since this morning.
reading snk manga.
@mikeshinoda Happens to me but when I want to search something on YouTube and the internet is down for some reason.
Hot chocolates are the best for rainy days <TEACUP WITHOUT HANDLE><DROPLET> 
#hotchocolate #rainyday #rain #raining #cold… 
seriously sleeping with sirens went from super long song titles to super short. they're adorable.
@KerrangMagazine @SWStheband I love it! It's so Sleeping With Sirens!
fly is so sws i like it!!
i'm now listening to fly by sws. sounds better so far
but i love kellin's vocals on it, his voice is just asdfghjkl
go go go is waaaay better
idk if i like it
listening to gold by sws 
damn you stupid copyrights
ugh, i'm soooooo pissed. my last year's video for joe's bday has been muted due to a claim by a copyrighted holder. 
sometimes i'm not able to stop looking at mike shinoda
jerry is now 40 but looks a lot younger
@JacobyShaddix are you coming back?
@JacobyShaddix When is Gravity music video going to be released? :)
@JacobyShaddix Roaches
My birthday boy just favorited my tweet <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
Happy Birthday to this awesome human being \m/ @jerryhorton  Wishing the best to the best <BIRTHDAY CAKE> 
I just love this man so much. #HappyBirthdayJerryHorton 
Happy Birthday to one of my favorite badass guitarist<BIRTHDAY CAKE> He's literally awesome<HEAVY BLACK HEART> #HappyBirthdayJerryHorton 
just a look like that it's enough to make you faint. 
I love this badass face. 
@jerryhorton Gravity, duh <PURPLE HEART>
wish chester was screaming on wastelands' solo studio version and not only on live version
any song suggestions about what song should i use on the video?
just started making joe's bday video
@Eleni_Lp exoun parei diazigio apo to 2013
Congrats to Adam Gontier on his marriage with Jeanie :) I wish them the best happiness! 
sleepy but reading btooom! manga bc it's amazing
That Jared Leto smile. 
too much sass 
Why can't I draw like this not even close? 
time to watch death parade
people who say that matt has more energy than adam, they're lying to themselves.
@jerryhorton or when shaking your head became the universal motion for No.
the really good thing about new 3dg is that they still sounds like 3dg. i mean you listen to the song and you think "this is 3dg"
that means two things. first, i need to go on a perfect holiday. second, i need to see paramore live.
that dream was really awesome. i was having the best holidays.
they were playing ain't fun and then i wanted to take a picture with hayley but i didn't make it.
i dreamed that i was on holidays and saw paramore playing live, randomly
i had a perfect dream this morning
no matter how many years passes, three days grace will not be the same without adam
Back to my roots <SPARKLES>

@LPSoldier2794 haha maybe they were drunk when they titled the video :)
@LPSoldier2794 haha why? I haven't watched it yet.
when are they going to show us what page is doing? why do I think she's in trouble?
spencer and aria are the cheating types, tbh.
and the best girl is hanna since she have never cheated or blamed her boyfriend
the best ship on pll right now is caleb
@TVDvampirelove it suited Elena's body and skin color best, tbh
Also Toby is treating Spencer more than better. He doesn't have to be sweet all the time to be treating her the best.
Neither does spencer
And some people say "these guys treat her better than Toby" my ass. Ofc they're gonna be nice at first... And they know nothing about them
Spencer should appreciate that but instead she's whining and going around and kissing random guys. So tired of her.
He's just focus on his job and serious about what he's doing.
I get it that he isn't giving her much of attention but it's not intentional and he's trying his best to keep things going
Toby became a cop to help Spencer and she doesn't appreciate it.
There's no way they're gonna do something they have done before.
People who continue to believe that Toby is A or has something to do with it they underestimate pll's writers.
Sleeping With Sirens are on the cover, that's enough reason for wanting to buy it.
I want the new of issue of Kerrang now!
@JacobyShaddix I hate running but I would love to go with you :)
I wanted to read a book this weekend but no, I have to study for a test on Monday, ugh.
My teacher needs to stop putting tests on Mondays.
Tomorrow is Friday. Finally!
Hahaha omg. 
My life. 
@TonyPRoach Badass <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
give pll a little more credit
people who think that one of the girls is a need to stop thinking that and move on, gosh that would be too obvious
i really felt sorry for allison in 5x22
my heart breaks seeing hanna in jail
who will spencer kiss next? most possibly someone who's not toby.
she's been acting like a slut gosh
spencer has been getting on my nerves lately
SERIOUSLY SPENCER? KISSING ANOTHER GUY? AGAIN? Ughh... she will never change.
how many guys will spencer flirt with? she's with toby for fuck's sake
time for pll x
pawn stars is awesome i'm addicted
holland makes me miss teen wolf even more
thank god for google translate
studying for my italian test tmr
What's the last book you read? — The Iron Trial by Cassandra Clare and Holly Black. 
Maya is the creepy queen.
I'm not going to school tmr.
I've been having fever since thursday
I'm sick of being sick
this is genius. 
many sites say that today's justin hills bday but it's not today so sorry. i got confused.
@Elirahh yeah, sorry. anw i'm going to delete the tweet because i'm so embarrassed omg. plus, people RTed it.
@Elirahh it looked liked you were making fun about me but okay.. if you say so
@Elirahh i can now recall wishing him back then. idk why but i totally forgot it
@Elirahh no need to make such a big deal about it. i just made a reasonable mistake.
@Elirahh oops because all the sites say so i got confused. and trust me, i'm not the only one.
even 10 seconds of Chester are enough to melt my heart. 
You can't make any plans when you're sick.
