I missed church yesterday... Lucky I got to watch it online today <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Smh. It was my first time missing church.
I'm so buildups
Just when I thought I was fine... I broke down out of no where. It was awks how people were just staring at me. Especially on the train <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
That awkward as moment how I cried all the way home from uni. I was crying waterfalls <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I don't even know why...
Feeling depressed as. I just wanna go home and cry. <BROKEN HEART>
I never really realized how much 2000 words was aye... Until I attempted it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><PISTOL> this is the second assignment I've done last minute.
I might stop playing so I have more time to focus on uni. I'm falling behind.
Tbh. Mum thinks I'm a pretty boy. Just cause she's seen girls talking to me at the games. They just ask about our team and stuff <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I hate it when I look back on life and think "I shouldn't have done that, I should have done this instead."
