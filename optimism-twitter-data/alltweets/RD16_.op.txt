@samswinn Gutted for you man! I've had a good weekend tbf <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 
@samswinn I've got some spare winnings knocking about in my account. Might have half time draw, full time draw though
@samswinn Haha, it's my last shift before holiday so I'd better turn up I guess <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> will be keeping an eye out though!
@samswinn I know, if I wasn't at work, I'd be half tempted to make the 20 minute drive and come watch <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn I'm hoping by me not betting on you, I won't curse you to a loss <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Boro, Preston and Southend for the play offs. Hull to go down. Me ¬£800 up. Simple plan.

@BHBetts Yeah it's a piss take to get there. And no real pubs around it either, only their own away fans bar which holds about 150 max
@BHBetts Worst stadium I've been to in many a year. I reckon you could honestly hear a 10p drop from the other end of the stadium.
@swinry @HarryMurphy31 p.s. Was too busy working to save money for a camping trip I still don't know anything about yet <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@swinry @HarryMurphy31 Haha, bless you. Genuinely stuck in 1930 when it comes to technology aren't ya.
@swinry You remember how I told you I have work at 3? Yeah that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

May 2nd: Derby finish 8th in the Championship on 77 pts. 
@Swindon_Gunt Haha if rumours are true mate, he'll be going of his own accord to Newcastle
Another 2 goal comeback needed. Sound <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That's it. Game over <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
We're always 3 on 3 on the counter attack. And with team of the year Keogh in extra diving in twat mode, we're more likely to concede again
@Machinx I mean yeah, any will do tbh <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but the irony of Martin being ex-Norwich and Norwich being in the play offs too
There's something about Chris Martin getting the goal to oust Ipswich out the play offs that appeals to me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Haha ffs cause a riot outside Costa
@swinry Haha then get annoyed that you've paid too much for your tickets cus you're only doing half the jounrey
@swinry Plus it'd take me like 3 hours to get there and I've got work at 3 so I couldn't even if I wanted to <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry That's cus you're a typically angry Welshman and I'm just chilled as fuck <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> and my dad wasn't a founding member of hooliganism <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Haha, hope you out a bet on us finishing 8th. Are Forest still in the league? Haven't heard from them since mid-February <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry That was you just trying to get a bite from me, was never actually a prediction <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Happy that you're so optimistic
@swinry Haha you've still gotta hope you can somehow get at least 2 wins from somewhere, or be very good at penalties <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Hahaha don't know whether to laugh or cry
That's ridiculous defending from Obita <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry We're still in last season's mode of "no one presses us so our defenders can have 862 touches of the ball"
@swinry You actually did <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Can't wait to welcome you up north again for the play offs <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Haha can't be any worse than last season pal
@Swindon_Gunt Put a bet on it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry I was nervous about 2 hours ago mate, gone well past squeaky bum time <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Swindon_Gunt Wolves need to win 6-0, Brentford need to win 1-0 and Derby need to lose and Wolves get the play offs <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Swindon_Gunt Yeah, Wolves and Brentford still can I'm sure <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Wolves need to win by 5 goals more than Brentford do if they win
@Swindon_Gunt We've decided that if we can't win the title, we don't want to go up at all
@Swindon_Gunt Even if we make the play offs we'll go and lose 43-4 on aggregate anyway
Yep. Here we go <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Jaack1884 Fuck that, I don't even trust Derby never mind trusting 2 relegated sides to beat 2 teams in the top 8 away from home <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Jaack1884 Scenes if Reading, Wigan and Millwall all won <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> ¬£450 up and still in the play offs <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèº<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@Jaack1884 After a 3-3 draw from 3-1 down and a 4-4 after 3-1 down, don't think my heart can take another 2 goal required comeback <WEARY FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Head into Derby early, get whatever I need, get back home and enjoy Jeff Stelling screaming at me telling me Derby are/not in the playoffs <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Tempting to put about ¬£50 on Reading so you know that one way or another you're gunna have something to look forward to after today <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Is this the miracle Wigan chairman David Sharpe was referring to when commenting on their chances of survival?
Kinda like the Championship for a lot of this season. Except if Blackpool had a squad and teams like Fulham/Wigan didn't under perform.
In an unrealistic scenario, what I'd like to see is a season whereby with 1 game left, you could either be champions or relegated.
Pay day landed an hour ago. First thing done, ordered a dominos of course <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@swinry Joke completely ruined because I forgot the word burn ffs
@swinry Away. Home fans are gunna the away stand down if we win. I'm sure bradford will be looking forward to that next year again.
@swinry Probably. We'll probably lose to Millwall Saturday knowing us. Would prefer the win to relegate them though
@swinry I'd take that tbh. Least likely to defend well which is what we need to even get a win these days
@JJWalters1992 Just a little. I sign foreign players not because they're better than British players, but so I don't have to hear that story

Wish I was joking, but I'm almost convinced Darley defend better than Derby <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry You'll bite before I do Jones <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@Danny_Holmes17 We'll still make the playoffs based on the players we've got to come back. But we can't defend like that and expect a win.
In the words of Harvey Dent: You make your own luck. We can't expect that bit of luck when we gift the opponents goals with such poor play.
That run. That is why we aren't playing football like we can. We just don't trust and simply cannot trust our defence <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
See if Derby were winning 2-0, 4 minutes of added time could quite easily mean 8/9
This is heading towards an 06/07 season. Top of the league until it matters then an undeserving play off promotion <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And where the fuck do you think you're going Keogh? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> please stay back too
Cyrus Christie, please stop running forward. Stay at the back and let the forwards do the running forward
I'd be raging with my defence if it was that easy to find space to put a ball in. But I've no defence for him not catching the ball after
The only defence I have for Grant is that the ball in comes from a player who is given the freedom of the left wing from a free kick
Danny Batth too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hahahahahahaha
You've got to be joking me
They know we almost always make a mistake, they just have to sit and wait for it
Derby need to stop pretending teams aren't willing to press us when we have the ball at the back like last season.
And a deflection too. Absolute perfection <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hahahaha of course that's just happened
Referee asking Baath for that ¬£10 that he owes him for not sending him off

@benrobinson09 Oh yeah hahahaha fuck sake <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@benrobinson09 Was actually your second time but still cute haha
And because we're not sure where our next clean sheet is coming from, we don't build from the back as much either. We're in football limbo.
Ever since the Birmingham result, we now look a little reluctant to burst forward with pace like we used to. We're tentative to overcommit.
We need a win. Simple as that. A point isn't good enough.

@BenjaminWillsSJ No. I refuse. Much like Lord of the Rings. I have far too many films to watch to waste 2 hours listening to "Let It Go".
@BenjaminWillsSJ Oh no, never better than Toy Story. Or Monsters Inc. They are still to this day my favourite kids films of all time.
The first thing I'm doing on payday is treating myself to a new phone charger. This one is a nightmare these days <WEARY FACE>
@BenjaminWillsSJ In my most humble opinion
@BenjaminWillsSJ How could you not thoroughly enjoy Despicable Me? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's aimed at 4 year olds, but still decent
@BenjaminWillsSJ If I had to recommend 2 modern day films to you, Wreck-it Ralph would be one. We're The Millers would be the other.
@BenjaminWillsSJ He seems to love a film from the mid 20th century. Which is all well and good, but how it beats Wreck-it Ralph is beyond me
@BenjaminWillsSJ I'll try and narrow down my personal list and then take on the list that people like Ernest from County Durham has voted on
@BenjaminWillsSJ Well, I know what I'm dedicating my 2017 to now. Would be 2016, but the Euros are on, rather watch those to be honest.
@BenjaminWillsSJ Right, I've seen 4 in the top 100. Apparently I've wasted the first 24 years of my life.
@BenjaminWillsSJ I can safely say that having just glanced at the top 10 rated films on IMDb, I've only seen numbers 9 and 10.
@BenjaminWillsSJ Pulp Fiction and American Hustle are another 2 I haven't seen that I'll be adding to my ever-growing list in my notes
@BenjaminWillsSJ What about yourself?
@BenjaminWillsSJ The Godfather, Casino, American Gangster, Horrible Bosses, Lawless, Four Lions, Senna, Pursuit of Happyness to name a few
@BenjaminWillsSJ I do have sympathy with your cause though. I have a list bigger than my arm of films I've been wanting to watch for ages.
@BenjaminWillsSJ I mean, lent only lasts 40 days, but I admire your dedication and commitment to Noah and his ark.
@STFCJAY @BlackPplVines I can honestly say I wasn't expecting that outcome first time I saw it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@BenjaminWillsSJ Maybe you should give some consideration to giving up sleep for lent?

@samswinn @benrobinson09 25 minute walk, it's pretty steady
@NaomiTroopx I'm glad someone appreciates the struggle! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> still haven't got out of bed yet to get it, but really fancy it <WEARY FACE>
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Haha nah I was quite cool in the kitchen surprisingly. Thought I'd still be at work now sorting everyone's errors <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn @benrobinson09 All dying ffs, running the place by myself
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Yeah I was doing that for the 3 hours before I went in the kitchen cus my receptionist rang in sick too <WEARY FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn @benrobinson09 I hope so. Means I won't have to see their faces tomorrow night <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Correct <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Sigh, creme egg has just rolled off my bed and across to the other side of my room. Cba to get out of bed but really want it ffs <PENSIVE FACE>
@samswinn @benrobinson09 I don't know, maybe? Was meant to be on the floor managing tonight but was needed in the kitchen so no idea <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@coventry_hayley Yeah ignore him, he just stalks my account for fun <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> xxx
@benrobinson09 @samswinn I spent my night making starters and desserts for a bunch of cunts
@samswinn No idea mate, Serie A is such a gamble ffs
@samswinn @benrobinson09 When you double your bank account by withdrawing ¬£20, I'd consider it a good night <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn Yeah I've seen haha, ridiculously late goals <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@coventry_hayley Wooo, should be a fun night haha <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> xxx
Although having seen that Fiorentina scored 2 in the last 8 minutes to come back and beat Milan, I'll consider myself fortunate <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Josh_BAFC I've just seen! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> only saw I won the bet, then checked the scores after. Lucky day for me then <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Little pick me up after work <RELIEVED FACE> 
Remember that one time that Sky Sources told us that Nigel Pearson was sacked <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
You do hear some absolute shit on the news don't you. "I'm not sure why swans fly to this farm, but it looks like they enjoy the grass." <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@paddypower Got to be Paddy Kenny! #PPFavePaddy
Don't worry Timbers, at least there wasn't another 9 minutes of injury time on top of the original 3 so the opponents could score again xo
Wow. Scenes at Providence Park.
@AppreciateJackT Recognise him playing in Europe, didn't know he was on Leeds' books for a few games though!
@coventry_hayley Yeah I know, haven't been out in ages! <WEARY FACE> and tomorrow night! And I'm working Tuesday night too? You on either? xx
@coventry_hayley Haha, it's worth a shout! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> and I'll see, I'm meant to be out in Leeds I think but if not then yes, I'll defo come out! xx
@coventry_hayley Ahhh gutted for you <WEARY FACE> Just change the place of the birthday to Amsterdam? haha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> xx
The Portland Woodchucks take a 1-0 lead into the half time interval against the West Coast Angels
@coventry_hayley Haha, would be class I reckon! When is it? xx
@coventry_hayley You manage to get tickets yeah?!
@SamAllsop1 I did. Saw the log disk too, was actually a decent goal. Counter attacking at its best
@SamAllsop1 Really want to call them glory supporters but I know that would be unfair. The inclement weather doesn't help attendance
Just thinking back to something I saw earlier. Matty Phillips, what a fucking hit son <FLUSHED FACE> absolute filth <FIRE> 
@SamAllsop1 Just watched a video. Fair play to them, if they could pick up that kind of atmosphere if they score today, that'd be class
@SamAllsop1 I'll give it a butchers now
@benrobinson09 Ffs <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@SamAllsop1 That sounds incredible. And yet, I can imagine a massive health and safety lawsuit somewhere along the line
When you were playing stuck in the mud as a kid and your mate won't come and set you free 
‚Äú@awkwardshake: 
@SamAllsop1 Did lumberjacks stand around the pitch and wait for the ball to go out before attacking the player who comes to take a throw in?
@D12ESTAR So many ex-Derby players too, it's quite bizarre.
First entry tonight, Liam Ridgewell for Portland Timbers <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I like this game of "How many average or obscure footballers do you know who have played in England and are currently playing in the MLS?"
One day, Bane will turn up. I promise.
@D12ESTAR Oh haha, apparently they told our gaffer last week that they're unbeaten at home <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@D12ESTAR Against the bottom 3 teams though, should be taking 9 points there! We're gunna attempt to take Al-Medina's unbeaten home record
Love these MLS refs, they're quite lenient, game actually flows rather than being a foul every 30 seconds for breathing on someone
A second goal for New Yorkshire City Blue!
@D12ESTAR Would love to agree but we didn't turn up. Decent goal to win it though, down to you to win 3 now!
@D12ESTAR Feel like a bet on him to be second goalscorer could be worth it!
Jesus, defo a red card <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> <RUNNER><DASH SYMBOL><DASH SYMBOL>
Wish this advert with Messi, Suarez etc on a plane with their terrible acting would divert to Malaysia and then disappear like the other one
1-0 to the New Yorkshire City Blue at half time #RealLifeProEvo6 
Seriously, how haven't New England scored <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@D12ESTAR 10 years ago, this kind of thing would've been unimaginable! These refs are quite lenient too for the main part
@D12ESTAR Gerrard and (maybe) Lampard turning up next season too. Star names slowly turning up. Albeit a bit aged, but still a huge coip
Oh there's David Villa. Steady finish <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> #NYCFC
@D12ESTAR Watched both games on Sky last week, I was kinda impressed! Some of it was dreadful, but some was okay! Mix's goal was decent
And a massive fan of the goalkeeper going to punch the ball clear from a cross and ending up kicking it away in mid air <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Being a fan of New York City FC because they have a player called Mix.

@Official_STFC Don't understand why you've blocked me sigh. C'mon, let's be friends again. I'll come to a home game sometime xo
Someone will be making a vine of Michael Carrick completely blanking James Wilson as I tweet this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Have I just seen Valencia float a cross in instead of driving it along the ground? What a time to be alive.
@swinry @LiamShort5 Haha, black Welsh baby. What a story. Another Hal Robson-Kanu in the making
@swinry @LiamShort5 You'll need him in form for the play offs tbf
@LiamShort5 Will do lad
@swinry @LiamShort5 He would cus we still don't have a striker <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry @LiamShort5 Fucking hell haha, what a great signing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@LiamShort5 It'll either be camping or work related cus of the course I have to do in Swindon <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@LiamShort5 @swinry Fuck sake haha, got Andy Williams scoring for fun though. Where's Obika these days?
@LiamShort5 Haha miss you too mate. I'll post details your way of when I'm down next <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@swinry Huge game at the end of April for you lot. All or nothing pretty much
@LiamShort5 Thanks for the support Liam <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@swinry Haha fucking hell, what a fall from grace that would be. You just worry about Preston and we'll take care of ourselves <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Still 100% confused as to why Swindon Town have blocked me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@HBirring There is literally no difference <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I think Gary Neville just doesn't like describing United as long ball.
@samswinn Not having that. Unless they're playing 50 yard passes across the ground (which they ain't) then it's the same thing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
So for the sake of naivety, what is the difference between a long ball and a long pass? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Apparently Fellaini is worth double what United actually paid for him
@benrobinson09 Haha, or running like a girl <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@benrobinson09 If he's not having a nap then ueah
What the fuck are Spurs doing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Townsend, how do you feel lad <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> feign an injury to make it look a bit more respectable
Someone talk to me about a Fellaini/Carrick goalscoring double <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
One goal takes the game. We're still top though, time to see off our season next week with another win.
I bet Adam Johnson's sat at home convinced that shagging underage girls and getting time is a worth it compared to playing for Sunderland.
@swinry Don't even know sigh <SLEEPY FACE>
@swinry Absolutely heartbroken over here <CRYING FACE> 
It's game day! 12 hours <EYES><SOCCER BALL>Ô∏è
@swinry Never heard so much bollocks in my life Jones <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> we're still in the mix
@swinry I'll take that though. Massive point without having a striker on the pitch again. And we have a massive week ahead of us too

@WorldStarFunny @benrobinson09 Erm okay <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Michael Scott is slowly becoming one of my heroes haha
How to be an tv pundit on English sport:
1) Watch England lose.
2) Claim our grass roots development is wrong and should copy best nations.
We're on the same points as Afghanistan. We could finish bottom of the group if we lost to Afghanistan and Scotland get a win <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I imagine this is what Bradford looked like when they beat Chelsea.
Next 3 weekends should be decent. Next weekend, hopefully a league title. Weekend after that, Comicon in Birmingham, then pay day week after
@samswinn All about the money though for him haha
@samswinn Orlando City!
@samswinn Yeah, but it was hardly a great goal. Deflected free kick <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn I dunno, I think I enjoyed it. Something a bit different haha
Just spent 4 hours of my life watching MLS games.

@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny Nope, can't find it haha
@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny If I find it, I'll send it on whatsapp hahaha
@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny I had a screenshot of it somewhere but I don't know if I do anymore haha, you begged me not to say anything <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny I don't know, maybe it's that conversation we had about the swindon away kits where you were horribly wrong
@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny Lets just say I'm surprised you remembered
@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny Well done <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@benrobinson09 @WorldStarFunny Do I have to ask the question or am I just gunna wait for you to try and tell me the right answer..

@WorldStarFunny @benrobinson09 If I watch this film, will I understand more things that you say to me when you confuse me?
@SamAllsop1 Then picked up injuries left, right and centre. Went on loan to Fulham after we got relegated in some strange type of deal
@SamAllsop1 Giles Barnes leading the line in the MLS for a team managed by Owen Coyle. If you said that in 2008, you'd have been sectioned.
@toppsicle Giles Barnes currently being managed by Owen Coyle!
@SamAllsop1 Nah, never. Not when you're playing alongside Eddie Lewis and Mile Sterjovski
Kansas selling out their stadium for the 54th MLS game in a row apparently. Fair play if that's true <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@SamAllsop1 Knew we definitely signed him, was just unsure about the price.
Benny Feilhaber starts for Kansas. Didn't Derby buy him for like ¬£1m or something for the 07/08 disaster season <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@swinry Haha, in summary, no one can finish and the commentators are boring as hell. John Solako hasn't got a fucking clue what's goingon
@BenjaminWillsSJ I love that Stamford Bridge was that quiet you could hear the ball nestling in the back of the net
@swinry Bavs could've had at least two goals in this game ffs
@BenjaminWillsSJ Cech was the best keeper in the world at that point and Ronaldinho turned up and left him standing. Special goal.

@swinry Matter of time I reckon haha. And who is the next corner going to be sponsored by in this hame? I reckon Capri-Sun

@D12ESTAR Nah we won't. We need a clean sheet first, and that ain't happening anytime soon ffs


@D12ESTAR As soon as we conceded, I knew we'd concede again. Just classic Derby bottling it. Playing all top teams next 4 games!
@D12ESTAR You do! We have to avoid defeat and then beat Al Medina again. So close <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@D12ESTAR Yes and no. We only need to beat your or Al Medina for the league now. But if you win next week that's pressure on us!
@D12ESTAR They gave us a decent game last week too tbf! Lots of long ball from them though. And the weather was abysmal.

Love this

@swinry Haha, playing up until August apparently
@swinry You actually had a game? Thought you were still waiting for your first game of 2015 until today <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Was your last goal when I saw you play about 5 months ago as well?
@swinry Haha, so you back stabbed your captain sigh. But Gary's all the better for it, scoring goals for fun these days
@swinry Haha ffs, who did you bribe for that honour? Or how many times did you hit Daylett for that to happen <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Sigh, look at Jonesy going fishing now that he spends his time warming the bench cus he can't get a game <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@swinry Haha, in the words of Gary Ellison: "Nah, I'm being genuine". Hoping one of my team mates favourite that tweet as proof now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And although it's been about 6 months, the lads were all quick to remind me it's the first time they've seen someone take the ball past me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@swinry Fuck sake haha, all or nothing game then
@swinry When's this showdown happening? Please don't say like last game of the season <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry beat Preston*
@swinry MK are wank. And no Afobe scoring all their goals either so they'll be in the play offs. You've gotta be Preston I guess
@swinry Both <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> win and you're laughing into the champ, lose and you're facing a trip up north mid May for the play offs <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry If any team in the top 6 Champ/ 2-4 League 1 can put a 6 game win run together now, they're up
@swinry Not that it helps us now. Would rather be bored and 8 points clear <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Sigh, would love to say the same for us but we haven't won in 3 games now. Love that the league's aren't boring like last season
@swinry Hahaha fuck sake <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> when you're about 2 points in front of Sheff Utd and we're still somehow top
@swinry All a bit much for a pre season friendly though ain't it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Yeah fair shout. Not too far of a walk from city centre to ground
@swinry Nah not really. There's a couple, but you've seen the area, businesses and fast food all over the shop <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@Danny_Holmes17 @Sam7Smith We love bottling it

@swinry Haha, you jumping in the Swansea end with your family yeah? <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@swinry Wouldn't surprise me mate. We're struggling without a striker <WEARY FACE>
@swinry 5 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
At least we scored today <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> means we need to score 3 each game now if we're intent on conceding 2 each game
Oh. And the reality sets in of how right you can be <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
If someone would like to make a table that shows where Derby would be if we didn't throw away winning positions, that'd be nice <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Nah you won't, play offs for you followed by a shock 2 leg loss to Doncaster
@swinry Haha, gunna be joining Blackpool and Millwall in league 1 at this rate <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Haha, at least we're still in the top two though <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Would've been a near perfect day too if we'd have won.

@STFCJAY I've bet on us in our dip too so don't worry, I know it's more of a long shot than usual <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
About time this treble paid out again tbf 
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Would love to say yes. Depends if we can score. That's why I didn't suggest it
@benrobinson09 Haha, you had a really good chance at the start of the second half too
@benrobinson09 Haha, I'm done now. I'll stop winding you up <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@benrobinson09 The drug money for your players playing so poor?

@samswinn @benrobinson09 Don't do it. Rather you had Barnet and Torquay than Peterborough
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Just means Peterborough will go and lose like 3-1 or something <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> swear their owner loves to kick off each week haha
@benrobinson09 @samswinn Ben knows <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Me personally, I've never trusted Peterborough. Don't know why. Burton I'd go for yeah
@benrobinson09 Pay you half of what? I didn't get any money <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@benrobinson09 I'm sorry. Not sure why I'm apologising but yolo
@benrobinson09 @samswinn Shrewsbury and Bury. Not Plymouth
@benrobinson09 So cute when you use mardy. Actually learning things
@benrobinson09 @samswinn Sigh :( in which case, Bury and Plymouth
@samswinn @benrobinson09 Okay, maybe it was the obvious answer then. I'll leave you to it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@benrobinson09 @samswinn Ffs, can't tell if you're being sarcasticly mardy or not

Remember when Fulham spent an 8 figure sum of money of a striker in the second tier of league football relying on promotion to avoid FFP
@benrobinson09 @GabzBenony96 Haha, but you only learn from the bad and you still need to learn loads mate
@benrobinson09 @GabzBenony96 Haha, I'm turning up in the middle of April cus you told me that's when it was

@GabzBenony96 @benrobinson09 Haha he's trying to get me to come and watch ffs, he just called himself Pirlo and said I can't miss out
@KristiannG @Gilology I mean, who better than Kolo. A man with more premier league winners medals than Steven Gerrard
@KristiannG @Gilology Haha, not entirely sure that seeing the ball out warrants a belly slide celebration but each to their own
@KristiannG @Gilology It is! I was quite enjoying Kolo just being an aeroplane before he launched an attack on the twin towers.

@SdangerKennedy Haha, as much as I'd love to say we will be, if we don't start scoring let alone winning soon, we'll be in 6th by next week!

@swinry I imagine there was greasy long haired teenager who stacks shelves and listens to heavy rock metal in his spare time in goals
@swinry This ridiculous waitrose 5 a side thing, they've just qualified for in the Nationals. Real life Jimmy Grimble moment for him I think
A team with Ben Robinson has actually won something. The magic of the cup is well and truly alive.

<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
So give it a years time and Oldham Athletic will all but be ready to let Adam Johnson train with them before 60,000 fans protest against it.
When you wanna bang but realise she's doing her Duke of Edinburgh award this week.. 
SkyBet has no chill <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
When you hear her parents come back early and you have to hide under the bed 
@MichaelWilson97 @benrobinson09
@SmiggyFIFA @benrobinson09
On a non-Adam Johnson related topic. Mum just asked if I wanted peas with my pasta carbonara. She rate or what?
@jackwhitehall Is it bad that the first thing I noticed was the tax disc is out of date? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Who knew there was so much innuendo laced within tweets relating to Adam Johnson that would all come back to haunt him 3 years later <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That last RT. I'm dead <SKULL><SKULL><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
See if this was 1996 or whatever, we'd have to wait until tomorrow for the papers to report it. Folks on Twitter worked it out in 8 minutes.
I just know that somewhere on this planet, Bavs is sat there grinning to himself and muttering Johnson every 20 seconds <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Adam Johnson leaving you behind after he takes your Vergini-ty 
@DanielHibbins Haha, might make him captain for double points. But double jeopardy when he gets -1000 for going prison in the first place <PENSIVE FACE>
‚Äú@dreaminofsanity: @AJohno_11 Thank you for today, the kids had a great time x‚Äù Fucking hell hahahahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@DanielHibbins Disappointed if it is him, gunna have to remove him from my dream team.
First Bobby Beale and now this. Twitter loves a mass round of Who Dunnit. It was Adam Johnson, in the basement, with his pipe.
So let's pretend Peter Crouch is getting bored of going home to Abbey Clancy every night. Decides to change it up a bit <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@DanielHibbins Was hoping the papers would dress it up that he's on loan from Man City etc. Heskey would be jokes tbh
‚Äú@Swindon_Gunt: Got to be forster.. too ugly for a normal bird‚Äù Based on the same logic, I'm going for Jon Flanagan. Fucking mutant him
@samswinn Want it to be one of either Milner, Gerrard, Wilshere, Zaha, Sterling or Terry.
@DanielHibbins Zaha is a great shout actually. Him and Sterling on a double teaming session <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> is it Micah Richards whilst he's in Florence?
@samswinn I don't want it to be Clyne, what a waste of his talent if he goes and does that ffs
@DanielHibbins Haha, upstanding family man and model professional James Milner. All hell would break loose if it was him
@DanielHibbins It's the kind of market Paddy Power would open up definitely. I'd have a cheeky ¬£5 on Sterling. Maybe ¬£1 on Henderson too.
Unless it's John Terry having an extra special visitor over after his cup winning heroics yesterday.
I'm trying to think outside the box. Stuart Downing, Luke Shaw, Andy Carroll, James Ward-Prowse.
@DanielHibbins I don't know if about 9 appearances in what seems like 4 years classes as regular or not. Sterling is odds on surely?
However, imagine the scenes if it was Bobby Zamora <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Praying this England player is Steven Gerrard <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>


@JackGarratt95 Someone else just mentioned that too and I agree. It's only because everyone's dropping points at the top. It's ridiculous.
@callumLtfc Probably could tbf. 6 points is a bit of a gap but at the rate of which all the top teams are dropping points, it's possible
With 12 games to go last season, I'm sure Leicester had pretty much gone up already. This season, it's still one of 6 
@swinry @samswinn Hahaha, it's like the opposite of some kid asking you to go buy them fags or something ffs <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry @samswinn That's ridiculous ffs. League 1 ticket offices are a joke <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

This defending from Leeds though. Borderline heroic at moments.
Boro again just one Grant Leadbitter penalty away from equalising.
Should be a decent atmosphere at the iPro tomorrow. Sheffield Wednesday in town. Normally bring a decent crowd.
Huge money on the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight being cancelled for some reason.
However, imagine the headlines if we defended that total and won. An unlikely scenario. More chance of seeing Blackpool defend a 2 goal lead
123 all out. We are quite possibly the worst team at the World Cup so far. Even the UAE are probably laughing at us.

Serious suggestion now. Man Utd, take the financial hit and cancel Falcao's loan. Keep Rooney up top. Wasting your time keeping Falcao there
Rooney dived <WEARY FACE><SWIMMER>
@smithman28 The thing is, I bet #BBCFALCAO actually gets the most votes, but then the BBC would just ignore it and give it whoever else <WEARY FACE>
Haha, really hope he gets the award <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #BBCFALCAO 
@mlbchubbs Yeah, at first I thought the linesman might have bottled it and given it offside, but nah, defo should've been given and it was

Sam Rush slowly making his way towards the freedom of the city if we carry on making signings and progressing as a club like this.

Steve McClaren's win percentage at Forest was only 8% less than Stuart Pearce's and he was only in charge for 13 games.
@HewitsonBrendan Haha, you're gunna be paying him to be kit man anyway, if he stays for another 12 months, he'll earn what you'd pay him off
@HewitsonBrendan You've actually got money mate, you just can't spend it on buying players
@HewitsonBrendan Haha, what a career. Think Pearce should just leave altogether, him staying won't help the club at all
My only remaining question is that if Dougie Freedman is manager, what kind of role is Stuart Pearce being offered? Managing U21's again?
@TomShaw001 @Official_NFFC @swinry Dougie Freedman. If it comes back to haunt me then so be it but what have you lot done hahahaha
@TomShaw001 @Official_NFFC @swinry You come from Heanor mate, you grew up with both sets of fans! Don't even know who you could get in mow
@TomShaw001 @Official_NFFC @swinry It's just as bad the other way too mate <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> this season it's funny cus you overhyped too early on promotion
@TomShaw001 @Official_NFFC @swinry Haha, Shawdog! Forgot you were a forest fan pal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm just keeping jones in the loop. He likes Forest too
@swinry @Official_NFFC One of only 3 wins in the last 22 games. It's a good job they had a decent first 8 games or they'd be fucked by now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry @Official_NFFC It's okay though cus he got a really big cheer on his first game back so it'll be fine
‚Äú@Official_NFFC: #NFFC have released the following statement. 
I wonder if Fawaz has still got any of that Sky Bet Transfer Fund left to pay for Pearce's compensation package? #SkyBetTransferFunded
Everyone waiting on a late southampton goal, Swansea go and score <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Haha textbook manager's response to a defeat reply <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Either way, you've gotta win. If Dons win and you don't, you're gunna be atruggling
@swinry But if MK win, you have to win and then City's game in hand becomes almost irrelevant. You can peg back 3 points if need be, not 6
@swinry Dons win. With a game in hand and already clear, if City win, they'll win the league. Then it's you vs Dons for one place
@dcfc_89 Yeah, heard the Ince rumour. Don't know if he's got the explosive speed that we look for in wingers. But could be a shout heah
@dcfc_89 Tony Fernandes said Phillips wasn't going anywhere. Would love Hoilett, quick, strong, powerful. Dunno who it'd be tbh
@dcfc_89 Once the summer comes, then we could buy someone new in. But with Russell to come back, we'd have too many wingers if we buy now
@dcfc_89 We probably could do with buying someone, but with Mase getting more of a look in and Ward back, we only really need temp cover
@Ryan_27 We can't go from having Rasiak up front to having Junior and Tudgay and expect the same results.
@Ryan_27 Those 2 going killed our next 2 seasons until we miraculously got promoted. If we don't go up, I think Hughes will go in the summer
@Ryan_27 Oh yeah, Huddlestone and Raziak for peanuts to Tottenham. Never again. We've done well to keep Hughes for so long in my opinion
@dcfc_89 It'll be an early chat with Mac and he'll say "we're not expecting anything", then we'll go and get some young winger in on loan
@Ryan_27 them*
@Ryan_27 We only need to add. We're not a selling club anymore, if players go, it's because we don't need rjem
@dcfc_89 We'll have some hotshot sky sports reporter stood outside Moor Farm and some 14 year olds in the back like Stoke do every year haha
Are Derby going to do the unexpected and actually have some transfer deadline day drama?

@JoeSellars Fucking hell, imagine being a league 1 club and rejecting ¬£2m for a player. Sell for ¬£3m, buy players in. You need to
@JoeSellars Asia's best player has played on the County Ground haha, you'll get no more than 1.5m for him, you love selling on the cheap

@JoeSellars Haha, he's a genius. Goes down like a sack of shit each game but gets us goals so fuck it haha
@BenjaminWillsSJ Hahaha, missed that one. I enjoyed that too. Not a bad night for you. Just not the dizzying heights of 10k RT's though

@swinry *Harry Redknapp voice* nahhh, nuffin at all in that. I've not erd it, I only know about the Chairman's van. Once I know, you'll know
@swinry Not the supporters, it was their chairmans van. Hilarious like but not the best move no, took reg plates off and let tires down <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swinry Same old, same old. We're only a "we run you when we come Derby" and "forest are magic" away from a full Jones cliche bingo card ffs
