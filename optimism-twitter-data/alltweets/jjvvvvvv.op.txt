@SoleyAdam that's cos you're a rational person mate!
@SoleyAdam These people are ridiculous.
@SoleyAdam haha, I disagree! but my brother got told he had blood on his hands yday, cos he came 3rd as a tory candidate in a council vote
@SoleyAdam Yep! I'm not surprised though, considering I've been called stupid, scum and told I have no soul in the last week as I vote Tory
@SoleyAdam well #toriesoutnow suggests the opposite. But even austerity has a mandate.
@markdmwilliams sorry if this is me hahaha!
why do these protestors feel the need to attack people/ property? that's not within your rights.
people protesting a democratically elected government? #makessense

@MarkIanHarrop tory party early on had the name, conservatives began to be known ad the tories
@JonnyNaylor but exit polls, even if not accurate give the jist of it so I'm liking the looks of things.
@JonnyNaylor I was thinking it'd be about 280 vs 260 with a tory coalition that doesnt work and another election in 6 months.
@JonnyNaylor I've tried to be quiet on that front this election, but that exit poll got me excited!
So happy looking at that exit poll, cant help but feel its a bit optimistic though
@EKSainsbury Im guessing they picked up some lib dem seats and did well in the marginals. If even remotely true, terrible for labour
@EKSainsbury was on about tories, shoulda made that clear!

@EKSainsbury I am a bit shocked its so high, think we have differing views of bad result!  they have been wrong in the past though
@EKSainsbury it looks tragic for lib dems
@ross_pne Bought my tickets for next sunday earlier!
@llaurararara they screw everyone over though!
gwon @JVickeryUK  
when discussing politics, dont shout at someone that doesnt agree with you. you look like a tool.
1 exam down, 6 to go!
@EKSainsbury negative campaigns and a turn to social media propaganda. its been dreadful.
Darrell Clarke is a bloody legend


@Official_BRFC is only the bottom tier going to be open at Wembley for the final?

We are going to wembley! #bristolrovers

@TheGiffo I left one at dans ages ago, could see if its still there? locked to orange though
@seftellsALL yeah glad we had that...nice confidece boost to go and trounce FGR on wednesday
@seftellsALL if you cant tell, I am extremely bitter.
@seftellsALL we were crap those first few games! We've been top of the form for months..few dubious ref decisions in Harrow today anyway!
@stevier_villa we won 7-0 but didn't get promoted. No revision is getting done.
@seftellsALL @BBCLondonSport should get deducted points for that! #bristolroverschampions
at least we're destroying alfreton...
COME ONNNNNNNN! 
@M_B_1972 yeah I'm bricking it! gonna be a stressful couple of hours

@Official_BRFC 11065

some absolute nonsense from all parties here #BBCDebate
@Bristol_Pirate @iaaforg it's true..they've done the same in the discus, only 11 got  that. I see a lot of marks at small meets coming.
In 2014, 10 male hammer throwers threw 78m+, Not enough for an Olympic final. So @iaaforg , why is 78m the standard for Rio 2016?
1am on a Friday night and I'm writing notes #bignight
@ktnnmrrynlds you're surprised by thsi?!
@ktnnmrrynlds that too...coulda told you that before though

@cheeseburgerkt no worries! wanted to say hello in my way!
@cheeseburgerkt you smell!
Getting in from work when it's going light out is depressing
@jackcrosby95 do it mate! I'm looking to go for masters

@jamie_webb94 sub 1:50 though! happy birthday mate!
just seen someone say drugs cheat deserve to be competing. What a load of rubbish.
So, I went to bed at 7 last night and I'm only just getting up...
7 down, 1 to go
@M_B_1972 thats us all over! dont know where all the money goes apart from ridiculous wages
Dont see why people are moaning about rovers putting in a challenge, Wycombe cheated. again.
@M_B_1972 probably is. But I'm shocked they didnt release a few plans for next year, esp given criticism over failure to prepare for conf
@M_B_1972 oh fair enough. I think thats possibly it. Been surprising to see so few statements in regards to anything substantial recently
@M_B_1972 probably will be. I still hope we have the review though. We shouldn't be finishing so low in the league!
I'm far too happy to be planning my winter training program considering how horrific it's going to be
@sjhankinson the BBC are rather annoying and kissing ukips behind the past few weeks...
@cheeseburgerkt gooood! They'll suck at the general election in comparison to everyone else. Cos they're a crap party
@cheeseburgerkt  protest vote and midterm blues, would be expected. Plus ukip always do well in European elections
@cheeseburgerkt conservatives are class, that's all you need!
@LukeAtThis_  Yep! Ignore the idiot and we'd all be fine!
@LukeAtThis_ Oh salmond is a tool! But more publicity is more seats. Look at bnp in the past
@LukeAtThis_ ukip did get a horrible amount of coverage from the bbc
@JonnyNaylor Around 60ish I'd say. Might be lower in Wigan cos of how safe makerfield and Wigan are for Labour
@JonnyNaylor @WiganCouncil no one ever cares about local, that's a roughly similar number as in the past
@GabbyKing_ finished reading for my one this morning at 8am. Perservere!
Solid 18 pages done in that exam #sorehand
@llaurararara feel the exact same. This year is just ridiculous in comparison
@EKSainsbury I find it ironic that labour will probably gain most from ukip entering the race too!
@EKSainsbury  I think they'll go down to single/ low double figures, lose loads of donors and never recover
@EKSainsbury the lib dems are finished in politics, such a pointless party now
@EKSainsbury I woulda definitely gone tory until they announced this referendum plan, terrible policy.
@EKSainsbury yeah, cant imagine it'd look good haha. I live in a ridiculous labour stronghold, no point in me voting!
@EKSainsbury could always stand as a candidate for them!
@EKSainsbury vote for these guys! 
Why have people come to the learning centre at this time to socialise?!
There is definitely a correlation between how long exams go on and how homeless I look
@Lisa__JT haha wow. Too busy getting their PhD to learn to spell!
@Lisa__JT I'm grateful if they can speak English!
@stevier_villa you do get knobs in all parties agreed, but they get scrutinised far more than ukip did until recently
@stevier_villa it doesnt help that there are a lot of idiots in ukip. and the majority base their stance on bigotry, not the economy.
@stevier_villa there is rarely an open debate of any parties policies outside the run up to general for big 3. Politics is just bitching
seriously contemplating ordering food to the learning centre...
@Matt_Kaye_ 3rd June, got another couple left this week yet!
4 exams left #halfway
@Matt_Kaye_ it must be torture for you. How are you coping!?
@Matt_Kaye_ bastard!
13 hours in the learning centre is far too long #sweaty
@jackcrosby95 Great run mate!
slowly losing all hope for tomorrow.
Didn't even realise it was counties tomorrow until about 10 minutes ago. Ooooops
@charlg93 just hoping it's not as horrific as an undergrad degree ha ha
@charlg93 that's basically it! Looking at doing my masters now too!
@charlg93 I realised about 5 years ago, why did I torture myself?!
My laptop has broken at the perfect time #exams
@M_B_1972 I use it to get all my rovers news, buggered now!
This is definitely the worst possible time to be ill
@EKSainsbury I feel for people who have left views at the moment...lib dems are no longer viable and labours policy is disagree with tories

WC squad chat now on @bbc5live 
@EKSainsbury I think we should pitch it, it'd be a great business decision!
New chancellor founded cobra. We all be getting discounts
@SpongebobRiches you're not forgiven for Friday!
I'd like to thank man city for the £40 I just won
Come on city!
@Rahullyyy mama mia cheesy chips?
never have to do econometrics again! yay!
@maegiee some is some isn't! Got my final exam tomorrow for a module that we had a test worth 20% where the average was 45
@maegiee Haha, fair enough! Im doing other modules next year cos it's easier than doing economics!
@maegiee nice variety at least! does it get better next year for you then?
@maegiee fair, I'll give you that one, I'd given up very early on :p what do you study?
@maegiee nerd! :p not sure I could manage that, my degree is just far too boring
now just given up and hate economics as a whole.
gone from feeling screwed, to alright and back to screwed about tomorrows exam, all in the space of about 3 hours
@maegiee suppose. I do miss a lot of registered stuff though
whenever I google for stuff to try and help me for modules, I always get links to american masters programs #toohard
@maegiee sucks for you! to be fair, even when i skip registered stuff uni dont care
@maegiee went to about 3 lectures in the last 4 weeks of last term! and only in seminars, lectures they don't. register for lecture sucks
@maegiee great effort! similar to my record for all of last term
@maegiee that's a lot to go to!
@TheGiffo @Carlpalin94 fair. Euro 2008 and the like though. My point was we should be properly challenging, with quarters being worst case
@TheGiffo @Carlpalin94 didn't in 2010! Not overly confident for this year either!
@Carlpalin94 not even winning! Just making quarters etc. We invented the damn game!
@TheGiffo smashed the retweets on this giffo #bigname
@Carlpalin94 fair enough! The problem is that all the top clubs have barely any English in their academy though
Or the FA gives clubs money for every English player they have through their academies? More than it costs the club to train them
@Carlpalin94 not really. Not even saying stick limits on senior squads, just,have more through academies and more funding for them
How about we just stick limits on the amount of foreign players acadamies are allowed?
still dont know how i got so burnt at bucs
The biggest travesty of rovers getting relegated is the fact they won't be on fifa 2015
still cant believe that we're gonna be playing eastleigh next season
Suarez crying has made me very happy
@russellrace27 yep! Someone mentioned he might try and get someone from Cardiff to set me one which would help loads
@russellrace27 Yeah, suppose! Need to find a coach and get s and c programme
@russellrace27 Yeah mate
Today just wasn't my day, had nothing there. Congrats to those who got medals though!
@stevier_villa ah fair, Thought you were on about villa!
@stevier_villa I'd say going out the football league is quite a big price too!
I now support a non league team. #Badday
@cheeseburgerkt what a stallion I am
Whoever said uni is easier than college lied.
@stevier_villa yes and no. smearing is what appeals to voters...look at american politics. might not like smearing but it does the job.
@stevier_villa there are legitimate arguments, opposition just opt to slander them as that is generally what will motivate voters.
I predicted it'd be 1-1. gonna kick myself if it comes off and I didn't bet on it
@jamie_webb94 I'm something like 13th going into it this year! not had a winters training either, so can only hope for a small pb!
@jamie_webb94 I'm gonna get my arsed handed to me! same to you man
@jamie_webb94 good one! I'll be watching a fair bit, we got 4 in the 800 and my bro is doing the sprints and relay  should be good ayway!
@jamie_webb94 yep! gonna be sat in the cafe revising though..last event bucs pretty much!
@jamie_webb94 2 weeks!? you lucky bastard!
Someone just shouted out a van at me calling me Paul scholes. Not sure how to take it
its 12pm, therefore its time to procrastinate and go and buy lunch
@Adam_Cunliffe1 there are plenty of other examples..see starbucks etc

They've made hammer a straight final at bucs. 21 person national final #ridiculous
