you wanted a fuckin strawman sjw you could pretend actually existed so you could wallow in liberal cowardice
if you fall for some fucking 4chan/8chan/kia fake feminist account like lets be real you wanted to believe it
@Sappo7 yeah, probably saw the same one i did then
the charade these accounts maintain falls apart even under passing scrutiny. they bank on people taking them at face value.
it seems like channers are starting some Fake Feminist accounts of late, something they've done in the past. Just look out for that.

which makes it all the more disappointing how happy he was to use sexualized lesbians to advertise his anime
As much as I love Ikuhara stuff his work doesn't exactly make me feel good about my sexual appetite
And still directly associates villainy with overt sexuality
honestly of his works that i've seen, utena is the closest to a sex positive story he's told and it still demonizes promiscuity
In that sense, that was incredibly dishonest and if you go into Yurikuma hoping for that content to be true/accurate you'll be disappointed.
It's far from being a sex positive show even remotely and something portrayed in the OP and advertisements isn't true.
Perhaps Yurikuma's biggest failings are disappointments brought about by how it was advertised.
I don't like Yurikuma as much as Mawaru or Utena. It didn't resonate with me in the same way. But it had powerful moments and was beautiful.
the ending credits scene of the last episode also validated my thoughts on ikuhara's attitude towards romantic relationships
finished gay bears. my criticism of ikuhara's relationship with sexuality in his anime still stands but otherwise it was pleasant.
the thing that absolutely baffles me about the sword or whip thing is that ANYONE is voting for sword
1.THEY own HoneyBadgerBite's "donation" campaign
2.THEY are HBB.


@ThatWrongLove huh
just.... what the fuck is wrong with cishet dudes that tampons gross them out

fighting game inputs as representative of the stance and subtle movements behind every technique
I'm thinking of doing the PS2 X games after the Zero games
which means if i want an A rank on this level if I die once then I have to just reset the game and load up the save
Like, it'll show the kills at the end but it won't actually count the ones from before you died.
Terrible thing about how Mega Man Zero 2 scores: If you die, it doesn't count any kills from before you died toward the killcount.
just gonna kill this lil fairy so i have more health
cyberelfs are horrifying
@Furgat very surreal and strange, none of it really explained, incredibly beautiful
@Furgat somber, quiet film with minimal dialogue. character art by yoshitaka amano. about a small girl with an egg and a man in a dead world

ps my pet peeve is when people say flcl is random and makes no sense
flcl is legit one of my fav anime. up there with like diebuster n stuff
like i usually prefer subs but the dub of flcl is just so good and so much more emotionally powerful for me

apparently you only get ex skills in Zero 2 if you have a high rank? *throws computer in the garbage*
*spends morning crying about zero*
and now zero is off fighting all alone. you cant do this sort of thing zero its not good for you. ;-;
thinking about the bit in FLCL where Naota cries against Haruko's chest "Where did you go? You just left without saying anything."
@isalbaglaciere im glad i dont wanna cry over zero fighting her boyfriend
IM LEGIT SAD OVER THESE QUEER ROBOTS
I beat MMZ and got to the bit where X tells Zero about how he kept fighting after Zero "disappeared"
poor X. Zero just left without saying goodbye.

@TheLaq ditto
@TheLaq &lt;3 Hope you enjoy/enjoyed watching
@gamerfortruth @a_man_in_black yes
But when you see the way the game indulges its own grotesqueness just... wow.
The protagonist is awful for his history alone and the fact that the game expects you to have even an ounce of sympathy for him is absurd
says a lot just in terms of the fact that the creators still thought those characters could serve as meaningful commentators on their world
Oh also I've caught bits and pieces of a Bioshock Infinite LP and the extent to which the focal characters get away with awful shit
today is a fun day ;9
someone go buy me a soda
here's they're list of journalists they're attacking I guess. Go offer those journalists some love and support.
we ran out of soda at my house and we dont have any juice and we're almost out of milk. the real dark souls starts here.
If you know folks who are on the list maybe send some kind words their way and show your support? Thank you.

even slutty bunnies have a bedtime. nighty night everybody
at this point you know what group of people im talking about and if you were involved in harassing and brigading my friend unfollow me
also i found out some folks brigaded and harassed a friend of mine of twitter and just wanna say fuck you to all involved
it accomplishes nothing and is a gross disrespect of boundaries
hey if someone doesn't wanna talk to you, even if they're an asshole or a bigot, don't keep messaging them
@Veeren_Jubbal just did &lt;3
jonathon oh go blow yourself


but they wanna claim that feminism is bad and evil so shitheads like j blow say ignorant shit
and they aren't even the majority.
if whedon was driven off twitter, which is being assumed, then the "angry feminists" were only a portion of those responsible
lets be real, the only reason ANYONE WHATSOEVER is buying into the "feminists drove whedon off twitter" narrative is cuz they want to

yeah this is an accurate depiction of @TheLaq's feelings about me

this is the game 
its clear that the creators stumbled ass backwards into creating a trans dude despite having seemingly no awareness trans dudes exist
these are why i say the character is a trans dude 
.@cateatsu the game is extremely problematic and tdoesn't realize they wrote a trans dude
@cateatsu nah, the trans dude is the one being misgendered in the text and has giant tits and rock hard muscles
like i said the game handles him really problematicaly
oh yeah the buff trans dude you can sleep with in that tower defense game. this is him.

a narrative is defended 
but it sounds like the narrative that whedon was driven off twitter by SJWs is a false narrative
so like if you're into social justice and bragging about driving whedon off twitter yer a shithead

two hits

both already blocked via blockbot (both l2)

definitely musta been SJWs…
the dude was getting a LOT of flack in his twitter feed from people mad that whedon things bucky should've stayed dead
oh okay this doesn't surprise me. also i did some searching and as much as this is being attributed to "SJWs"
boundaries are important. respect boundaries. if your social justice doesn't respect boundaries its hardly justice.
dont take pride in driving someone off twitter with abuse for any reason
The villain of Moulin Rouge is a really entitled Kickstarter backer

im not saying daddy kink is bad, i just think it's interesting and perhaps important to consider these things.
with perhaps daddy kink being more normalized because its perceived as a "safe" outlet for that
I would wager the vast majority of incestuous abuse is committed by father figures and that this is the cause.
but a father owning/controlling the sexuality of his daughter is a societal norm, even brothers are involved to an extent
difference being that our culture doesn't tend to encourage a mother's ownership of her children's sexuality
interesting the normalization of het kink where partner calls other "daddy" vs queer kinks or even any kink, het/queer, involving "mommy"

as like i'd already decided his mother's chronic depression was a thing and then i was like oh right that fits how i've been writing him
Also had a moment of realization where I went "Oh yeah, this character probably inherited his mother's chronic depression"
What happens when the victim of familial abuse sees no reason to tolerate that abuse anymore?
What happens to the emotionally dependent member of the relationship when their lover breaks things off without warning or explanation?
What happens when you decide to override individual agency and "rescue" a victim with no concept of self-worth from their abusive partner.
A familial relationship where abuse is tolerated because the victims feels a social obligation to let their abuse continue.
A relationship so imbalanced in power that one member is emotionally dependent on the other.
A character who values themselves so little they'd let their partner kill them.
Thinking about the abusive relationships I want to depict in stories and relationships of agency in them.

just wrap all my friends in blankies, hand them stuffies, and put on something cute for them
@Veeren_Jubbal I did not know this!
listen there is no problem that cannot be solved by handing someone their stuffies, wrapping them snug in a blankie, and smooch their head
sometimes i wanna go full mom on some of my friends. and then i remember not all of my friends are littles.
Hey @Andrea_Ritsu is super fucking cool and you should check out her patreon and if you can afford to please support her?

I'll make a more "proper" announcement video for…
Your lip service to trans people isn't any good if you support anti-trans ideologues.
Also I'm hearing the article Anita linked links a really transphobic post in a positive way and um... um Anita...

Anyway, none of this is surprising since FemFreq's feminism has always been pretty basic 101 shit. So, whatever.
@letao_nox lewd
AKA if your argument fundamentally undermines itself so bald-facedly you done fucked up.
The comic FemFreq linked actually reifies feminism as about choice, in terms of making those decisions actually a choice and not forced.
never forget the best EO class
And yet that is exactly what "Feminism isn't about choice" is frequently used to defend.
Feminism as liberation of women as a social class, if we're going by FemFreq's def, is in no way advanced by shaming SWers or femininity.
There is no singular Feminism. Never has been. Saying that there is just allows those with the biggest platforms to define what that is.
Feminism is a variety of different and at times conflicting ideas, such conflicts and variations being the result of different philosophies.
But Feminism Isn't About Choice is a rhetoric used often by radfems to hate on sex workers and femininity
Like yeah feminism shouldn't be entirely about choice because there are choices to be critical of. Like being a bigot.
"Feminism isn't about choice. To prove this, here are examples where there is only the illusion of choice."
im hearing femfreq shared the work of a SWERF/TERF? or osmething
@meaganewaller @femfreq can i see where she defended meghan murphy?
@TheLaq i renamed it tinkerbell but now im renaming it again to that meme this is your fault you did this

@MaxwellTolvo I won't hate you.
I am very defensive of my friends. I'm a mama snow leopard when it comes to them.
If you used to be a part of that group of people, I hope you've learned better by now. If you weren't, don't become like them.
that stalked and harassed a close friend of mine for a long-ass time and that was super fucked up and they have legit trauma over it
One thing I will say personally is I'm not fond of the idea of self-identifying as anime marxist or whatever cuz a group of people who did
@MallowyGoodness yes
And you getting super defensive and shitty regardless of their tone. Because that's what almost always happens.
A big reason why many are super aggressive when calling out is because they've already resigned themselves to you not listening regardless.
I'll tell you a secret.
legit baffled why anyone would play as a Hyur in FFXIV
@laevantine strength/skill should, imo, be filled just for being able to use weapons at all.
@laevantine nah. most weapons don't gain from stats well, so dump a lotta points in health, decent amount in stamina, etc
If you can't stand to hear that marginalized folks are being made to feel unsafe in this space, then I don't particularly care about you.
I know that by voicing any of this, I'm "causing drama" and "feeding conflict" and whatever. I don't care.

It's actually a REAL thing.

Stop becoming like them.


There are non-queer folks who experience other oppression who are afraid as well. But I'm a white queer girl and I wanna stay in my lane.
it's my fault people are afraid to criticize someone else or how outspoken queer people are the real monsters.
I'll be here all day, which is good cuz I'm assuming if I don't get ignored I'll get people brigading my mentions about how
When all of this is said and done, aGG will just be another example of "allies" throwing people under the bus in defense of their own ego.
And y'all are either too scared of rocking the boat to do anything or the reason people are afraid.
I don't even have to criticize anyone in particular for it to be clear just how fucked this all is. People are genuinely afraid of you.
I literally just saw a friend get dogpiled for calling one person out.
Regardless of anything else, that folks are being made afraid to speak up is fact. That's not something to be argued with.
Same as folks being afraid to speak up about Brianna Wu or Randi Harper or anyone else.
Queer people and many others are afraid to speak up and criticize any aGG people lately. There's a climate of fear around speaking up.

Thanks.
Transmisogyny and to a lesser extent homophobia are viewed purely as minor inconveniences when they show up as games, if not enjoyed.
Whatever. Everyone will still be excited for it because lets be real nobody but like a handful of people take transmisogyny seriously
I genuinely regret watching the video.
I saw that Nanako was gonna be playable in P4D and got excited cuz Nanako is a cool kid but I genuinely regret my brief excitement.
Even if the former I'll still kind of expect transmisogyny thrown in there as well.
I can't imagine that character not being an offensive caricature of either gay men or trans women.
I'm actually really anxious now!
@laevantine Yeah. I mean, the way I see it odds are it'll be an offensive stereotype, of which group we'll have to wait and see.
I have thoughts but I wanna hold off on voicing them until I hear back.

@theschwasound they made TWO MORE after

You call yourself social justice?! Smdh. 
everything about this game is bad
just killed a robot who had committed suicided previously for being accused of being a maverick
does x6 have multiple endings
So uh I guess I can play as Zero now? This is weird I didn't actually expect this.
"We will join hands, and never let anyone sever us again." cuties
aaaaagh end me
so wait are all the robot masters robots who have been killed before and brought back somehow?
beaten three out of eight robot masters
@FreezingInferno yeh
this game is the worst
Metal Shark Player.... okay.
hahaha fuck this ice stage is the worst thing ever
should i do the ice boss first?
also like im not sure why humans even exist anymore like they havent been necessary for the story for a long time now
mods the megaman franchise to correctly gender zero
420 high max
the story creates a NEED for the maverick hunters but it also sort of implies that they aren't great
also its really hard to think of Maverick Hunters as good guys at this point cuz lots of reploids have a VERY negative opinion of them
mega man x6 starts with x getting a letter from his dead girlfriend "in my restless dreams i see that town. silent hill."
hi zero's ghost
so i guess x6 assumes Zero's ending is the one closest to canon
@iris_merril :) so i hear
like zero successfully destroyed the space colony! except the earth looks p much like he didn't??
x6 takes place after some weird amalgam of x5's endings

Report everyone in this tag. 
@laevantine i feel kinda weird about it but its not getting at me too much like... its weird but feels largely harmless personally
@the_moviebob damn that sentence made me sad

@thisisjustaride i like reading zero as a girl &lt;:
Like its just straight up canon that these two are lovers and any other reading is fucking silly
and the ending I just got in X5 X has Zero's saber and talks about him and Zero being together forever.
So like apart from all the other stuff there's a part where Sigma refers to Zero as the one most important to X
mega man got lewd 
do you ever meet a wily ghost in any of the X games?
@theschwasound zero is ok
i did it. i destroyed the colony
I can confirm this.
reminds of that shit where like when you criticize the sexualization of women in games some dude jumps in "DO YOU WANT THEM TO BE UGLY"
*eyes roll out of sockets*
1.) two queer women
2.) a pair of sisters
but yeah she's probs totes aromantic
tbh i think if lightning were romantically interested in anyone, not sexually, the only person i could see that being is serah
@laevantine yeah i heard about that, but im still at least glad that she is asexual.
FFXIII as a series is very queer. Like the only het relationships are Serah + Snow and Caius + Yeul
@wix_vixen you dont need to go that far i just think its important is all
reminder that lightning is canon asexual
and I can see hope hating himself for that
like hope having all this pent up anger toward snow but i imagine there being a part of him that liked snow, even crushed on him
@laevantine I also like the implication that he was returned to that younger age cuz that's the version of him lightning knew
i think a lot about hope being gay and the part where snow is carrying him
@laevantine I like hope a lot he's cute.
@laevantine and it creates a reason for there to be so much build up bad feelings between him and his dad
@laevantine Oh yeah like apart from Vanille and Fang I interpret Hope as gay because imo it makes his story arc more interesting
@laevantine Like that its all girl cast and femininity are what garnered it so much hate.
@laevantine NGL I feel like as much as I think there are very valid criticisms against X-2 to make, most vocal hate of it is anti-feminine
When I think of @the_moviebob's Really That Good videos it furthers my feelings that discussion of games is still often so... immature.
@laevantine That by criticizing these games and calling them awful, we're proving that we're Better than these games. It's silly
@laevantine Like, that in this current cultural moment its popular to shittalk these particular games, so we make a show of it
@laevantine *nods* I feel like a lot of FF opinion has more to do with cliques and like zeitgeist attitudes? (hope im using that word right)
twitter, which despair girl am i
@laevantine That's okay I make jerk off motions when most people on the internet try and have convos about how awful a particular FF game is
whatever i'll go with this 
i need a new soundtrack to listen to
yeah not having any luck with this, will have to come back to it later
@EFZ713 cuz im not sure when it rolls the numbers that decide pass/fail
@EFZ713 resetting the game and loading the save file
every time i load this file and fail to destroy it with the laser i fire the shuttle at it and that doesnt work either fuck this game
free me from this hell
i hate this
Are whatever numbers that decide the success/failure of this already decided thus reloading wont work or am I just super unlucky
So I have a save file after I defeat the fourth boss and get the fourth cannon part. The cutscene plays right after loading the file.
does anyone know if there's anything i can do to guarantee destroying the colony or like anything i need to know to do it?
still no luck destroying the space colony despite reloading this save a bunch am i missing something

@TheLaq @mechapoetic I just DM'd Lana and I'll just screencap the DMs I sent her and send em to you real quick.
@mechapoetic Yeah, I do. I trust you more than most anyone.
@mechapoetic IDK I won't bring it up now if you don't wanna hear it now / at all, but if you wanna chat about it we can DM or somethin
@mechapoetic There's like one other part to this but I don't wanna bring it up publicly
@mechapoetic to GG or just don't care about GG and that's why they aren't appreciating The Important Work Their Allies Are Doing
@mechapoetic It's being framed by that by folks. That somehow "anime marxists" and "altgames" are the same crew and are either sympathetic
eventually i'll get it and then i can get the Good X Ending and the Good Zero Ending
and im gonna try and shoot the cannon from the beginning and reset every time it fails. its actual save files so its not cheating
oh yeah so when you beat x5 it gives you a code to unlock the ultimate armor from the beginning. so i did that for zero
Photoset: blackmagicalgirlmisandry: guitarsandcontrabandx: SourceThis is disgusting. I hope she’s okay.... 
omg the president now owns a picture of homohomu
also this implication that someone repaired X and that someone has been rebuilding Sigma. Like... maybe Dr Cain? He's disappeared a while.
i think i'll just watch the endings for zero and x if zero didn't go maverick
i cant believe you forgot your girlfriend x ;-; sad end
yeah it's just fucking canon that zero and x are lovers

whereas there's SO MUCH that implies that zero and x are in love and in a committed relationship
i've heard a lot of people say iris was zero's girlfriend but there's nothing in x4 that really implies romantic involvement between them???
"You can just spam this if you wanna be cheap" what a coincidence i do wanna be cheap
god bless capcom for destroying the mega man franchise
capcom murdered mega man x
also also i love the idea of "this is gonna be the last game" and capcom being like "no make more, but do it on a rush schedule"
Also is x5 where all the games production was rushed as hell or did that start with x6
@isalbaglaciere I actually heard that X5 was supposed to be the last one. Maybe its an MGS sorta thing.
whatever lets go kill my girlfriend I GUESS
ALSO if you play the intro stage as Zero then Mega Man loses his armor from X4!
Oh yeah the beginning of Squid Adler's level is the worst shit, but a lot of X5 levels are ALSO the worst shit
Angry at video games
"More often than not, though, the launch will be a failure"
"If the launch happens to be a success, the colony will be destroyed and you'll be able to access the final stages right away."
that is such fucking bullshit
what the fuck
okay so its just a random chance whether or not you successfully destroy the space colony and that decides whether or not zero turns evil?
x5 is a bad game
i like how you go to all this effort in x5 to stop the space colony from crashing and it does anyway and almost everyone is dead

Not in the right mind to handle frustration well right now. I should get away from Twitter when that happens.
I think I'm right to be frustrated with recent Twitter stuff but I don't think I handled it great and for that I apologize.
@laevantine I understand. It's been a lot of things piling up. Personally, I didn't handle it well today so I'm feelin kinda apologetic
@a_man_in_black Sure, I just don't want you to think I'm angry with you. You and @davidsgallant are good people I'm just frustrated
@laevantine sorry. just a lot of bullshit that some folks i care about have gotten caught up in
@a_man_in_black &lt;3 im not upset with you. stressed in general and still frustrated about izzy and nafedude and shit. but not angry at you
Protect yourself from Bug
Yeah I'm kinda grumpy. Sorry. Friend saw folks still endorsing the people who pulled that shit and yeah I take it kinda personally.
Merely referencing this had someone jump into my mentions with, "But the trans people STARTED IT" just so you know. just fyi. yeh
@davidsgallant But hey if you wanna find that apology for me I can at least see if it actually qualifies as one
@davidsgallant a lot of harassment for it, but nah the harassment he experienced is the only harassment people I looked up to cared about.
@davidsgallant Hardly the only one who did, and I'm dubious of any apology he gave after all that shit. People who called him out got

still haven't gotten any recommendations for which mega man x5 boss to fight first. im playing as zero
duff mcwhalen miniboss is a pain in my butt i'll do a different level first thankfully this game has saves so i can just go back to last one
Photoset: babypinkacrylicnails: blackladyjeanvaljean: kittycatsandcurlyqs: vagabond-named-veli: thundvrr:... 
tell me what robot master to start with. whichever is easiest please. i cant afford many game overs
its interesting how the X games dont even bother explaining how Sigma survives. He just does. He's eternal
Okay Twitter, time for Mega Man X cuz I can't FFXIV till I have food in me. Should I play as X or Zero first?
@TheLaq :&lt;

@TheLaq nooo im hungry
i was supposed to go to bed but i drank more coffee and had good talkin and im gonna cook some crab cakes

That really means a lot to me. I've got good family. Not all my family are good. But the ones who are are really good.
I also know hes afraid of messing up and saying something that would hurt me. But he wants to know more so he can be better at supporting me
It honestly made me really happy. My grandpa has been really supportive and hasn't said anything shitty about my being trans.
The other day my grandpa sent me an email about how he watched the Jenner interview and paid a lot of attention cuz he wanted to know more.
@TheLaq @sokareemie @theschwasound for real
Photo: mxcleod: Police abuse their wives, girlfriends, and family members four times more than the national... 
@sokareemie @theschwasound "obvious she's talking about ____! how awful!"
@sokareemie @theschwasound weirdest thing was how people made it into attacks on specific people rather than criticism of general behavior
Like I've been guilty of this stuff in the past. And I've contributed to this problem. I gotta be more conscious of this stuff. We all do
@sokareemie @theschwasound the biggest disappointment for me is seeing folks i respected double down or attack folks for saying this
Stuff like that Boston Magazine thing I just RTd are important. eggavatarthreenine saying a slur aren't really. not at this point.

Shouts to @BostonMagazine for clearing things up about how this mess got started
Bringing up a major GG awfulness thing is more valuable if it isn't constantly bordered with "This rando is a transphobe"
Also like, I think when there's a constant static of GG stuff it minimizes the major stuff?
Folks should read my mentions. Lots of valuable stuff being brought up that I don't wanna just spam RT
social harm, not harm against individuals
Stream Friends also brought up that the main ones doing the most harm are the people using GamerGate toward their own ends. Like TB and such
@wix_vixen @sokareemie yeah, but it's just gone beyond critiquing. it's just showing it off and attaching the ethics meme
@sokareemie It's really really easy to just play into this stuff without a single thought
@sokareemie Yeah, same thing happened with something else recently. If it hadn't affected someone close to me I would have contributed.
.@sokareemie and when so many people are emotionally overwhelmed by this stuff emotionally it ends up hurting more than helping
.@sokareemie "What does this accomplish beyond letting me feel smug about pissing a GGer off or getting some RTs of some asshole's tweet"
.@sokareemie and going out of your way to aggravate GG which, while GGers are shitheads who deserve to be aggravated, it's very "why???"
.@sokareemie on some level Twitter encourages this sort of behavior. Sharing around examples of randos being ignorant to laught at and RT
.@sokareemie NGL I've kinda contributed to the "masturbatory" element of Gamergate critical shit and like... there's a weird habitual aspect
I agree with everything she's saying.
listening to an over month old stream friends stream where @sokareemie brings up the same stuff she said recently about gg
hey folks is there anything i should know about in regards to mega man x5 before i start playing it?
@taitaisanchez Thank you! I'm really happy to hear that
Mega Man x4 is very much zero's story, which is strange since the boss patterns are mainly designed around x
also x and zero are a cute couple &lt;3
i beat mega man x4 playing as both x and zero huzzah
@TheLaq my apologies, im failing my brand
I've reached Sigma with X. Will grab coffee, then fight him.
i am garbage and i must be destroyed
@TheLaq Sorry to keep you ~up~ all night
@TheLaq dont you mean thirsty~?
@TheLaq breaking news tron bonne spends all morning jerkin off to roll
@TheLaq wow that's a lot of stamina!
@TheLaq oh yeah ////
@TheLaq i uh
@TheLaq oh goodness~ I can only imagine the sort of messes the servbots have to clean up lately
@TheLaq all my fault
@TheLaq ///// dat's lewd
Split Mushroom defeated
which arm upgrade should i get for X
Beat the first fight with the Colonel
Beat Cyber Peacock
Beat Slash Beast
Playing X4 as X. Frost Walrus and Jet Stingray down.
x5 is the one with the "time limit" right?
Just beat Mega Man X4 as Zero.
and every time I just keep thinking "are you ready for some FOOTBALL"
Every Sigma form says "Are you ready for..." and it varies depending on what form it is
"Ever try thinking of it from the perspective of the looted?" Maybe don't try this tactic on the girl who regretted calling cops when mugged
i have no problem with the riot and i have no problem with a portion of those rioting looting some shit, regardless of what they loot
@AustinCHowe rip in peace christa
@the_moviebob seems like a pretty fair response to their economic oppression. Hell, even stealing luxury items is in that context
@the_moviebob also worth noting that black folks, as a social class, are kept financially oppressed so stealing practical necessities
@OhPoorPup omg
@OhPoorPup :O
i almsot beat sigma's final form and now im out of etanks and i cant leave to refill them quickly or i'll have to fight all eight robots

why does sigma have three forms but i only have two health tanks what is this bullshit
@Veeren_Jubbal &lt;3 u a lot i really hope i can give you a big ol' hug someday
@stillgray Can you delete this tweet? That article is a dishonest framing of her death. 
hey twitter i have a question. after i beat x4 with zero should i play through as x
@Veeren_Jubbal same. i get to be all bratty and eat tons of candy.

@TheLaq yeah i have that on my chocobo its so good
@wix_vixen @TheLaq Why would you need a bell? Say something cute at Bitsy and they'll bell for you~
there are no good cops. all cops are scum.
Please read that. Especially if you've been hearing her death was a direct result of harassment.

@the_moviebob @ScrewAttack i cant believe you're remaking big trouble in little china wait till my friends hear the news


please stop perpetuating the narrative that it was harassment that killed rachel bryk
it is disrespectful to someone's memory to use their death as a political tool against harassment when harassment isn't what killed them

@Quinnae_Moon err this series of tweets 
@Quinnae_Moon Um, can you give these tweets from Kiri a look real quick? 
Three mahatmas left. The Mahatma of the Goat apparently awakens a sense of "causation" in my bow....

I dont' wanna be powerful in death. I wanna be at peace.
if i ever die, be it natural causes, suicide, or murdered, please don't ever say Rest In Power about me.
Because that's the narrative. I don't like that.
If I ever committed suicide, it probably wouldn't actually have much to do with my transness / transphobia, yet it would be framed that way.
And that contributes to using their deaths as political tools rather than simply recognizing them as the tragedy they are.
But when we decide why a person committed suicide for them, we often end up doing so in ways that fit our personal biases.
I do have cause to bring this up. No I won't share details.
Hey, maybe don't presume you know why a particular person committed suicide? Unless told directly or they left a note, you might be wrong.


@TheLaq *hugs tight* I'm so sorry hon. I wish I knew what to say. We lost a good person.
please give me actually good advice with this game im so unfamiliar with it
okay which boss should i do first mushroom?
@TheLaq im sorry
@TheLaq yer not supposed to come on twitter your supposed to come on me
colonel is a hell of a name

yes i know playing as zero is harder.
in x4 wily says that his rivalry (with light or mega man??) is what gives him motivation in life
know in advance like secrets that you can permanently fuck up
okay so im about to start mega man x4. should i play as x or zero and is there anything i need to know in advance?

@Veeren_Jubbal but also, maybe a bit tmi, but I might be autistic I haven't been diagnosed so I'm not sure, so it feels weird to talk about

@VoltySquirrel @Andrea_Ritsu No.
@MallowyGoodness hi
@Andrea_Ritsu I wasn't talking about you.
End of discussion.
Regardless of whatever excuse you make for it, I'm not going to a stream where I can expect to be bombarded with sexism and transphobia
I am not particularly interested in hearing excuses for why its not GDQs fault the chat is unreadable
I don't wanna support a stream if that's the chat I can expect
and jsut generally when they did care about moderating chat apparently it was more "You said too many naughty words" than bigotry
and the chat was full of fucking transphobic awfulness, and it sounds like the moderators didn't really do shit about that
Basically GDQ doesn't really moderate their chat even remotely well so I guess last time they had a trans person speedrunning
please dont make my friends sit through another chrono trigger run
Like TBH I don't think I'll watch GDQ given some stuff that happened last time, but I have friends who do watch it and yeah
"Fuck MGR lets make people watch Chrono Trigger again"
what is GDQ even doing
Megaman Legends: 1:08, also rejected
His intro is landing, making a rainbow with AQUA MAN in it, and saying "I'm aqua man, but you can call me Handsome, guy~"

#StopCapitalism2015
yo i know we could be all Fuck Video Games about this but I have a better idea
@wix_vixen There's a lot of backlash right now but it might die down. Valve is doubling down and defending this.
@MammonMachine ggggggg i really want this to be a thing now. "battling" queers
.@wix_vixen Bethesda gets $200 cuz they're the dev and the publisher. Valve gets $100 for hosting it.
They already got their sixty fucking dollars so fuck em.
Why does Bethesda deserve ANY profit from the labor of modders? You can't use the mods or create them without having already bought the game
But this exploitation of labor is really just capitalism in a nutshell. It's not new. It's just showing up in a new place.
If your users paid for the tools, then they deserve the profit from the labour they did with those tools.
But this isn't really going to help with that. It's going to damage the modding community in a big way all so Bethesda can make some cash.
And the thing is that modders do put in a lot of work and they deserve to be able to make money doing that if they want.
a mere fraction of the money earned from their work, with the majority revenue going to Bethesda. It's HUGELY exploitative.
that people will actually wanna buy. So, you won't be able to compete with that if you're a solo modder, but the teams will be splitting
may very well lead to teams of modders forming and splitting the money they make off of it. Cuz that'll be the only way they can make stuff
What's more it'll make it even harder to be a successful modder if you're working by yourself. Because the necessity of the work of others
Making it so much harder to build on and expand the work of others. It undermines the working alongside each other that existed.
every modder isn't just competing for popularity / social clout but for money. And now everyone will be much more protective of their mods
I think this is a good thing. Introducing the paid mods element, IF IT STAYS AND IF IT "SUCCEEDS", undermines that a lot, because now
element has enabled people to just kind of build on the work of each other and work alongside without working with each other.
Alright. So as fucking awful as the modding community for stuff like Minecraft and Skyrim is, the fact that it's been without a money

@laevantine @isalbaglaciere I should download and play those they sound great
dunno what the ideal order for x3 is but i'll start with ice always start with ice
.@ingdamnit right but the games ALSO imply that reploids feel justified in rebelling against humans as tho humans are oppressing them?
And a more modern take on Mega Man X as a franchise would probably have being Maverick akin to the Cogito Virus in Ergo Proxy
but in x3 i think it does convey the consequences of those games being the mass oppression of reploids
oh yeah so in mega man x and x2 its not really clear why reploids want/need to rebel against humans cuz humans aren't really shown?
I want to learn how to do this.
I dunno if I'm strong enough to do this without some help or some sort of guide.
But helping them not to be consumed by it. And helping them to get through other pain caused by this stuff.
And to devote the time and energy I would have spent being angry toward supporting my friends. Letting them know their anger is valid.
But I'm realizing that perhaps the better way of handling my anger in a lot of these instances would be to silently block the shitty folks
I feel its so much easier to be angry. And that the anger of others feeds our own anger, and then our anger fuels theirs.
@micfok Like that our own anger is being stoked and worsened by the anger of our peers and this feeds into itself
@micfok I feel that anger can function as a social phenomenon where it is encouraged by others being angry
This is different from saying that the anger is unjustified or anything of that sort.
A lot of anger i feel lately seems part of a social phenomenon. I wanna change that for myself and those I care about if I can.
Hm. Does anyone have any useful resources I could look at about the social aspects of anger and how to undermine that or distance from it?
there are so many people i want to know i wanna do better for them but i dont know where to begin
if I didn't have whatever else it is I have going on in my brain
and i can't help but have part of me wonder if i'd know what to do if i was neurotypical. if i didnt have chronic anxiety/depression.
i feel so incredibly lost now. i wanna create safe spaces for friends and others. i wanna support the people i love.
i'll be honest. lately, im scared. i wanna do right by the people i care about but i dont know what to do. i dunno how.
@MammonMachine there are people who dont wanna be manhandled by a snarling butch?
and no way to see what is posted in the private group unless yer in it?
can we just get like Twitter but with the ability to create private groups?
We've made it wholly unsafe to be a teenager on the internet. Adults ruin everything.
and im not saying there aren't positives now, but more and more we see stuff that tells us we aren't ready for this. we arent' good enough
maybe the social experience of the internet has been fully ruined by late capitalism, and we can't go back to the positives of before
i dont know what the answer to this is. i dont know if there even is an answer. i feel like these problems are so massive they're beyond us
and there's not really an escape from adult abusiveness anymore it feels like, because the main social scenes are so incredibly public
and so many of them adults. and adults willing to go after and hurt each other and children and teens. adults are very abusive.
but i think it was so valuable and so important. and now you have places like tumblr and twitter where there's just SO MANY PEOPLE
i remember being part of at least one community that was entirely composed of young teens. and having those spaces wasn't without issue
i feel like to a certain extent the internet was a space where kids could get away from the overwhelming presence and control of adults?
the internet has created all these new contexts and challenges and i think we're discovering just how unprepared we are for all of them

serges is a fucker
aka they're no different than any other hetcis fuckers i've watched throw trans people under the bus
a resounding fuck you to trans people and sent the message that for all their progressive posturing they don't really give a shit about us
So lets be real, folks like Izzy, and I'll go ahead and add Peter Coffin and NAFEDUDE and SJWreptilian to the list too, just gave
But nah hetcis with thousands of followers getting attacked and bullied is The Real Problem Here
And yeah I know there are some trans people lining up to defend Izzy too. I'm disappointed in them but used to trans people attacking others
have been targeted for harassment as a result of Izzy presenting vulnerable trans people as being no different than GG, etc
What you'll notice? Hmmm, the hetcis folks defending Izzy aren't the only ones who've had to lock Twitter accounts, had to delete accounts
Okay so my big sis @rokkankitten did this storify about what's been going on. Give it a look. 
@MaxwellTolvo I'm sorry you're going through that
swear to god seen so many fucking useless cis people showing themselves as such the past few days
Cuz then you're Just Some Asshole using a form of oppression that doesn't affect you to shut down people speaking up about their oppression
Maybe don't be a white guy saying, "I'm more justified calling Izzy's critics racist than trans people are to call him transphobic"
I'm also gonna add to that list real quick
excuse refusing to apologize for this shit or acknowledging that it was fucked up, then yer shit
And lets be real, I called out a bunch of shit last night that needs accounting for. and if you're gonna use the behavior of others to
is some straight up bullshit, and it also doesn't excuse people referring to upset trans people as "whiners" and "concern trolls"
But to act like that only happens to the cishet dudes, or that it makes Izzy's behavior any more acceptable, or negates need for apology
And I guarantee you some people have gotten involved just to cause conflict and pull some awful shit.
And part of the reason that happened is the way stuff can lead to dogpiling... Stuff like Izzy screencapping the tweets of trans people
And that's not good, even with the power differential acknowledged
Like I guess I'll acknowledge that I'm sure some of the people calling Izzy and pals out probably were awful and harassy about it
all armor pieces collected, all zero parts collected, all etanks collected and filled, all health upgrades collected, no save state abuse
@Veeren_Jubbal I'm sorry that all this is going on after you've just come to Twitter. I really don't want any of this to be happening.
@Veeren_Jubbal trans folks they're mad at, and it's affecting trans people I personally know, and I can't pretend its not happening.
@Veeren_Jubbal I don't like fighting, and I'm not trying to fight, but I'm seeing a lot of folks I thought were better being shitty about
I am so fucking done with cis people swear to god.
been doing this without a guide so far. will probably pull up a guide after beating all eight robot masters
