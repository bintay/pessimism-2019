@hierodula @DruHart @joshmrowley @geoffholsclaw Maybe asking–as opposed to stating–"should we do x" is 1st step to escaping dominance
@geoffholsclaw @hierodula @DruHart @joshmrowley explain your trick question
Nothing wrong with starting out your day with a jog and a web convo' w/ @pagitt. Thanks for the chat, friend!
@hierodula @DruHart @joshmrowley @geoffholsclaw "reproduce dominance" = control the conversation/definition/expression

@kmoliver Thanks, man. Likewise. Can't believe I beat you to the "send" button for once!
@rudolph_reyes2 Thanks, m'man! Glad to have met you in Chi-town.
This was fun! @emjennielle @rudolp_reyes2 @finemwart @kmoliver @brittanyssw @Msahdev Thanks to each of you! #mySSW
@brittanyssw But it does require us to approach evangelism differently than what animated historical grievances like colonialism #mySSW
@brittanyssw Additionally, I think #millennials have grown up in a culture more accepting of diversity, which makes it easier #mySSW
@brittanyssw My experience is that #millennials tend to have less baggage around #evangelism than their older counterparts. #mySSW
@brittanyssw U earn the right by first listening. Typically, people aren’t interested in ur story until u listen 2 theirs. #mySSW #Episcopal
@brittanyssw  As it relates, to #socialmedia, my hope is always that it leads to in-person dialog ultimately. #mySSW #Episcopal
@brittanyssw Evangelism is as much about listening as it is talking. #mySSW #Episcopal
@brittanyssw Yes, it’s a tool–a tool to start conversations, which is a huge part of healthy evangelism. #mySSW #Episcopal
@kmoliver Spot on! That @tombrackett always the greatest ways of putting it! #mySSW
@finemwart Exactly!
. @brittanyssw That #evangelism requires talking to strangers. #mySSW #Episcopal
@brittanyssw That it’s intended to export a culture. That it assumes God is not already at work in a particular context. #mySSW #Episcopal
If it were to become "normal" to talk about the good news of God showing up in our lives, I wonder how anxious we'd be about it. #mySSW
Part of this has 2 do w/ how 2 define "evangelism." #mySSW
No matter the environment I think it starts w/ modelling, starting the conversation. That's the hardest part. #mySSW
It’s always been normal 4 me 2 talk about God, no matter the context. That’s a big part–learning 2 talk about God n non-weird ways #mySSW
. @dcyoungadult Secondly, I think Scripture provides a guiding narrative to finding God. Lastly, in a word: Jesus. (2 of 2)
. @dcyoungadult Great clip, Jonathan! My answer? Practices that assist us in "finding" God: relationship, service and ritual. (1 of 2)

Loving the @kcrw "Guest DJ Project" #podcast
It pays to complain sometimes. @comcast customer care called @brookemevans today and took care of us. We appreciate being heard.
How awesome. @Comcast just called. Not customer care but a sales call. Its amazing how terrible their service is.
@comcastmichael @comcastwill I have no problem sending you an email but @comcast has already proven the irony of that email address
@comcastmichael @comcast @comcastwill after hours on the phone you asked us to fax you something. #21stcenturyfail #customerservicefail
@comcastmichael charged multiple times for @comcast mistakes at rates we did not agree to. Rep's have not been able to clear up our account
@comcastwill we've spent too many hours on the phone trying to fix @comcast mistakes. I think we're better off finding a better service
I just want to say publicly how terrible a company @Comcast is. #unethical
