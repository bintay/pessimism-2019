IF SOMEBODY DID THIS FOR ME I'D LOVE THEM FOREVER. P.S I USUALLY FALL ASLEEP AT LIKE 9:30 SOOO GET TO IT 
GOALS 
I fuck up all the good things I have for myself. I really do hate myself a lot and I'm honestly done with life. Gonna go cry myself to sleep
It's times like this where I wish everything was back to normal because I need someone where I can cry into their arms forever.
@fkadaddy makeout with me duh.
that moment when you realize people really don't care as much as you thought they did...
All I want to do is lie next to you and tell you how I really feel right now, but I can't so I'll lay down and cry about it instead.
I love you . <WEARY FACE>
I feel way to embarrassed right now and my heart has been racing all day. honestly regretting everything. Depression might come back again.
jokes are fun in front of friends, but when you're serious about something it's not a joke anymore. just nope.
nope. fucking done with people. I always end up like fucking crying because of them. everyone is officially irrelevant, u less I talk to you
if I'm really quiet then usual. Chances are I'm about to burst into tears or I'm really upset. Most likely me crying though.
usually happy in school, but today I feel like crying yay.

WHY DID I JUST NOTICE THAT THE GUY WHO PLAYED BERTRUM IN JESSIE WAS IN THE ADDAMS FAMILY. HOLY SHIT IM DYING
when your friend actually believes your story
I'm still very upset that I believed I had a boyfriend even though it was a dream. Now I hate everything.
FUCK MY AMAZING IMAGINATION. ACTUALLY MAKING ME BELIEVE I HAD A HOT BOYFRIEND. YOU DONT DO THAT ON THIS DAY
I smell nuts... Mind you I'm allergic....
So if you guys out there have any crushes on me speak up now because I won't be using my phone tomorrow.
Just saying, Valentines Day is tomorrow and I'm still single.

When your that funny that you need an award to prove it. 
besides everybody in Hoboken knows who's a thot, literally its 1 mile the word gets spread.
Honestly the thots in Hoboken know who they are. If you're fucking around a lot with every guy trying to get an STD you're obviously a thot.
This is why Hoboken sucks ass, when you instagram feed is people trying to gain a follow from an exposing thot account.

I might just end up taking a nap honestly.
There's two choices. Go to the mall and not get anything or stay home and eat food. You best know I'm staying home and eating.
Rare picture of me being sexy 
I have the habit of falling in love with clothing that I don't own and then when I find out the price I get so mad that its expensive.
THE AMOUNT OF HOT GUYS IN THIS MALL RIGHT NOW JESUS I'M DYING
food is fucking life <AUBERGINE><SMIRKING FACE>
my naps are the things that make me feel so happy on the inside and outside <SMIRKING FACE>
Take me on a date to see Into the Woods and I'd do anything you want afterwards.
I'm up, yet I'm not even tired... Fuck my life
All I want for Christmas is nudes tbh.
when you take a long ass nap, but then have a dream about your crush. That's the shit that makes me love bae and life.
I honestly feel like I'm depressed and I don't know why.

1 headphone in: dont talk to me 

no headphones in: dont talk to me

me: my laptop

me: i lost a follower when i was sleeping
when you get up early, but in all honesty you wish you were sleeping.
when you had a really great day, but then everything gets fucked up and pisses you off. basically my whole life honestly.
JESUS HELP ME MY EYES ARE ITCHING LIKE CRAZY AUDAME
somebody should talk to me because I'm lonely and bored.
That feeling you get when you're just straight up depressed for no reason but you know you should be having a good time.
When all you want is him. Basically me right now <WEARY FACE>
Feeling the need to cry is just one of those things that make me feel 10x insecure then I already am.
Its just so difficult to be honest. When you think you're doing everything right, there's always that one thing that fucks you over.
When all I can do is feel like complete shit is when I think more about how insecure I really am. Then I end up fucking depressed. yay.
what you don't understand is that I'm gradually starting to just give up and when I do it will be the best feeling in the world.
when you have people in your life that pretend to like you, but then one day magically don't. #relatableasfuck
Done with these fake ass people in Hoboken High School. You can all suck my ass because you're basically peasents making way for your king.
My mouth is a saxophone. I blow hard and got a lot more action in the 90s <SMIRKING FACE>
Me when somebody hot starts talking to me 
Me when people think I care 
Me when I see a bitch from school 
Me when I see a hot guy with my friends 
Got me a 12-13-14. Not a relationship, but a friendship that'll hopefully last a lifetime <OK HAND SIGN>
Stressing over projects is the best feeling <UNAMUSED FACE>
When you sit at home waiting for somebody you cares a lot about to talk to you.

Just incase a bitch is feeling irreplaceable
Ways to ask me out
1.) Tell me you love me in front of your friends.
2.) Call me a ho ho hoe on Christmas
3.) Take me to your favorite place
Today's one of those days where I'm just like "lemme commit suicide bc of these fuckers." But then I remind myself that I'm the bomb so.
1. ur hot 
2. i agree
3. i think ur a complete idiot
4. i know u hate me &amp; i want u to know tha…
HAHA JUST KIDDING BECAUSE PORNOGRAPHY IS BAD AND I DON'T DO THAT STUFF
I want a boyfriend so that I can get some serious help right now <SMIRKING FACE>

Literally I feel like @tropicooI is hotter then half of the people in my school. Mind you he's gay which makes things perfect.
Basically me at parties. 
Porngraphy is sexual and perfect for school, but not right now.
IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS AND I STILL HAVE NO BOYFRIEND. MAYBE SOMEBODY SHOULD GET ME THAT FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT. NOW THAT'D BE AN AMAZING GIFT.
It's times like this where I wish I had a friend that completely understands me and is willing to let me stay at their house and cry.
@AlliAol143 HONESTLY SAME ALLI HE NEEDA GET HIS SHIT TOGETHER AND NOTICE US
Honestly me witnessing my first encounter with an eggplant. <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> forever and always 12/1/14

To have a friendship like @scotthoying @mitchgrassi &amp; @kirstin_taylor would be better then having a person who doesn't give a damn about you
Someone should try and talk to me because I'm bored and in need of someone.
Fuck Augustus Waters. Remember Troy Bolton went 1000 miles just to be with Gabriella Montez. I want a boyfriend like that.
How to get away with Murder needs to come faster because I don't have time to be waiting till ten. I'm tired as fuck.
