@travellagos Greed, politics, and a mix of wickedness.
@adebarikhamil @Gidi_Traffic To be honest, I am asking the same question. I haven't got fuel either.
A few things can still make you cry, laugh or angry, your emotions and  psyche are intact... Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGratefu
You're healthy, you have hopes and have appetite, expecting tomorrow to come probably better... Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Been through some crap. You can look at current challenges and compare them to past ones.
Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Working towards a goal. Even if you’re exhausted and it feels miles away, you have a dream.
Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Got interest in something, a happier life, better relationships...something intrigues you. Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Lost relationships, the fact that you had them in the first place hints possibility of another.
Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Got a space of your own, not necessarily a home, just a room, corner, desk, where you govern... Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
You can sense what isn’t right in your life, just simply being aware n communicate to yourself. Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Got a few cool clothes for different ocassions. Not just to shield but to decorate your body.
Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Got time+means to do things beyond the bare minimum. Seen a movie recently, bought a book... Your life is good! #StreetsByKel #BeGrateful
Continuing from where I left off last night about proofs that your life is going well...
