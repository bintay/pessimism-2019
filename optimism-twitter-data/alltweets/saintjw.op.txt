@scottjohnson cheers for the stream :)
@dirtgame two flat tyres and no lights = 11 minutes!
@scottjohnson yup, early rear puncture means a terrible 11 minutes plus time for me!
@redsaintuk all the pubs in Ryde are dodgy!
@scottjohnson yo, how about a couple of DiRT Rally stages on the stream later? Maybe the Daily Stage so we can compare ineptitude? :)
@Angryrobotics as for 40k @theoverlords podcast is really cool.
@Angryrobotics anything that @scottjohnson does on the Frogpants network. Pretty much everything else on Frogpants too tbh.
There is no spoon...
@dirtgame pretty much any monte carlo route, leaving the road = terminal damage. Wales I can roll down a hillside, hit a few trees and be ok
@dirtgame inconsistency between falling off a ledge in monte carlo and Wales. The first is terminal, the second not #feedbackfriday
@VoiceOfOBrien you know what they say about a smart arse in the bible? "A wise man knows himself" ;)
@scottjohnson lies!!!
#GE2015 
@dirtgame got my first green split time today! Not sure I'll ever graduate out of Open rallys! Still the most racing fun I've had in years.
Ok, twitter can fuck off today. See you tomorrow.
@instanceshow I am one of that number. Not enough to do warrant the sub and playing Heroes/Hearthstone/Dirt/Pillars instead. I'll be back.
@NotPatrick @scottjohnson @GISgamer @JustinRYoung Hey! Stick to the goddam subject!!! ;)
@dirtgame a new location please! The three we have are great but need more variety #wishlistwednesday


Loving DiRT Rally. Takes me back to the old school Colin Mcrae games but with modern graphics and physics @dirtgame #dirtrally

Kael’thas Reddit Q&amp;A on May 12th &gt; 
@scottjohnson have you totalled a car yet? Makes for some very cautious driving! It's like the automotive Dark Souls.
I can almost hear Steve Mclaren laughing from here after a call from Newcastle!
"I'm going to leave the country/Island/Region if &lt;insert party here&gt; wins!!!" #yawn #dontletthedoorhityouonthewayout
So glad I wasn't on twitter during the last election. Probably wouldn't have carried on...
@BoopShow if you like point to point rally with pace notes a la Colin Mcrae 1-4 then yes. I think it's awesome but I like pure rally stuff.
@BoopShow hey I noticed! I just don't like to hassle you as you're a busy guy. Dirt review coming your way soon too.
@emmit93 (((((((hugs)))))))
Chuffed for Stuart Bingham #worldsnooker
Stompa!!! 
@PlayHearthstone Iron Juggernaut. Still a solid minion even if the bomb doesn't go off. Millhouse too risky and there are better late bombs.
@scottjohnson Peter Molyneaux for Prime Minister!! Over promises and under delivers, the perfect politician!
@NotPatrick I think I'm just bored of origin stories as the more recent films have been much better. AoU has me hooked now.
@NotPatrick didn't like either, cap 2 on the other hand was really good.
@morningstream in my head he's doing a Kenneth Williams impression! Matron!!
Very happy with the #Raiders draft. Now ready to get stupidly optimistic for the coming season #CarrToCooper
@scottjohnson @KyleFergusson @GarrettArt great games and great banter too!
@GarrettArt @scottjohnson yay!! Show us how to not suck at Starcraft in an hour! ;)
Well played Stuart Bingham!! #worldsnooker
@redsaintuk tweet when you're winning, you only tweet with when you're winning... ;)
@scottjohnson you Americans are sooooo behind us Brits! ;) (it's awesome)
@scottjohnson oh hi there Raynor says Neo! 
@GarrettArt @scottjohnson ditto, Alien.
@Hearthhead hi, is there any way to automatically update my card library on the site from Hearthstone?
@ScrappySPJ I used to study mocks for months but it's all useless so I'll just wait and see in the morning. Fast wideout for the Raiders.
@BlizzardCSEU_EN is it safe to login to hearthhead with my 
Great to see @scottjohnson appearing on @eurogamer. He is one of the best podcasters out there and a great artist too.
Avoided pointless politics by beating @redsaintuk and @Felna at Carcassonne with a personal record score of 145.
@scottjohnson comic idea - Avengers stood around, one says, "Can't we just ask how old Ultron is?"
@scottjohnson w00t!!
@scottjohnson do we get a choice or random or both? Also ouch for your and Carter's signing hands!
@b33rdy Guardians of the Galaxy?
@TheTrekNerd you need to check out a 90s bbc show called Cyber Zone for true terrible tv. They'll be some cool @morningstream soundbites too
@GarrettArt Illinois picked Anub Arak. It's like they wanted to lose!
Illinois picked Anub Arak? No wonder they're 3 levels down! #stormthedorm @BlizzHeroes
Reading up on @PlayHearthstone arena strategies and noticed the article was written by @williedills. Hearthphone has got me back in big time
@scottjohnson @nvidia no work tomorrow so gonna stay up late to watch the action! Btw chat, Diablo, Heroes works for me :)
@instanceshow I've finished listing. Now I'm upright I might start listening ; )
"Why Star Trek Ships Always Meet Nose-to-Nose"

@ITNcast life &gt; podcasts guys. Catch you next week.
The phone version has got me playing @PlayHearthstone again! I'm just getting complaints from @tikkabootwo about the Murloc noises!
@damianwalshe @IsleOfWightFest @JohnGiddings01 @WellChild good luck guys!! Don't drown, it would be terrible for our coffee sales!
@scottjohnson how is anything other than the secret of nihm on there?!? Terrified me as a child mind you!
@scottjohnson beat em ups
@TheTrekNerd @scottjohnson sitcom as opposed to sketch comedy a la SNL etc.
@scottjohnson @nerdtacularshow one year I'll hop across the pond. Sounds and looks like a blast!
Disguise your mid life crisis/ego trip by standing as an Independent Candidate in the General Election.

Cc @TwopTwips
@scottjohnson last episode of @TheInstance has got the missus downloading the ptr! Alliance garrison is right by the sea too.

Gandalf is trying to get an achievement for taking the Ring to Mordor using on…

They are not a 'Fan of Knives'.
@scottjohnson listening to yesterday's tms, I can't imagine angry Scott at all!
@Warcraft @BlizzHeroes @Veliice @Diablo @PlayHearthstone you can keep your heroes! Apart from Sylvanas. And Rehgar. Maybe Muradin.
@instanceshow I was hoping for old old dungeons, vanilla or more tbc. These ones seem like l was running them last week!


@scottjohnson it's one of the great things about HotS, lots of different characters for lots of different players. Azmo-dunk beats all tho;)
@scottjohnson that and Sylvanas isn't a tank. A tank made of paper. A paper tank. Can you tell I'm not a fan?
@scottjohnson but she can banshee scream away and I (try) not to go in close. Once Hammer is planted she's dead v quickly in my experience.
@scottjohnson that and Sgt Hammer is slow and made of paper! Azmo-dunk and Sylvanas are waaaay better and more fun imho. I like a specialist
@emmit93 you sure you're not looking at a mirror? #zing #burn
@morningstream Fall on Me is THE best REM track and from their best album. Great cover too.
@CaptainBeverage barely works on my Galaxy S3 too.
@androidcentral now we just need a rundown of what I should upgrade to for a better experience than my S3 is giving me.
@scottjohnson @PlayHearthstone for the first time in an age I have a genuine reason to want an upgrade! My Galaxy S3 is struggling.
@scottjohnson ahhhh, context!
@scottjohnson even so, I'm pretty sure we learned such things at around 13 over here?
@scottjohnson isn't she nearly 18!?!
Off to see John Wick on a whim. Wick on a whim.
@custard1980 I think you'll find that's Ser Jorah! ;)
@scottjohnson you said no twitter on monday!! What happened to your day off?
Full English breakfast, shame about the coffee.
@scottjohnson @Jon_Jagger @nvidia you make a good team!
@davechiv1 my stepson's wedding reception. Been a long day!
@iowct bonjour fromage merci!!
@virtualranger we have one, he's awesome!
@redsaintuk nope, Matt's wedding!
@redsaintuk @BlizzHeroes I have a spare if you want?
@redsaintuk now get her playing @BlizzHeroes !
@virtualranger all my trousers have poop bags in them!
@mgbarrett enjoy this trip. And it is a trip.
@williedills @instanceshow hey, stick to the goddam subject!! ;)
@GarrettArt @ITNcast @BlizzHeroes going to a wedding tomorrow, this is going to get me through the dull bits!
I am going to spend the day tomorrow doing my bad Richie Benaud impression. RIP Richie
@morningstream hey guys, can I get a good luck as I've got an interview for a job at Games Workshop on Monday #asktms #dreamjob
@WightHot ooer!! Oh wait, someTHING... ;)
@NotPatrick one man's meat etc. I'm with you on this though, can't see the fun in it at all.
@scottjohnson this is excellent news for when I can't stay up until 0200. Obviously that's not your fault and all but it helps massively.
@scottjohnson cars? Where is the real Scott Johnson and what have you done with him?!?
@scottjohnson @GarrettArt GLORIOUS!!
@instanceshow I have 3 EU ones I can't give away as all my friends are already in or are "console gamers" *sigh*
@redsaintuk #hashtag
@BlizzHeroes more complex than she first appears. Potentially lethal but don't get drawn in!


@scottjohnson challenge accepted!!!
@scottjohnson dunno about religion but you are very close to a very long warhammer/warcraft email my good sir!!! #nerdrage
Except one. 
He's never gonna give you Up.
@scottjohnson great stream as always
No work tomorrow so staying up to watch @scottjohnson on the @nvidia Twitch channel at 2300
@redsaintuk I am an artisté don't you know!
@BoopShow going on past results, there is a better than even chance of this!
Super Off Peak Return. Sounds like it should be a SNES game!


@scottjohnson (I'll stay up mind as I've got a Sunday off for a change!)
@scottjohnson @nvidia I know it's not your call Scott but only being able to watch live seems archaic in this day and age. 0200 finish here.
@Farrantula gave me paws for thought...
Get in Pelle!!! #saintsfc
@scottjohnson me just get up for work
@CaptainBeverage I've got some spares if you want to try it
@CaptainBeverage do you have a Heroes of the Storm beta key?
@ITNcast @scottjohnson @BlizzHeroes so the Thrall show then? ;)
@danielvanc cheers :)
@gredgie like you didn't know! ;)
@mgbarrett @custard1980 dam straight we rock! :)
Birthday stuff!! 
@scottjohnson (of how we percive the us)
@scottjohnson This is a pretty accurate representation!  @ThePoke: How Brits See America 
@custard1980 and Happy Birthday to you too!
@TravelMagazine @FoxNewsTravel #airlinepilot #airtravel @latimestravel @WeAreALPA 
@BoopShow @BlizzHeroes they all sucked any fun out by having daft idiosyncratic "standards" that Blizz had redefined.
@morningstream How did you two meet and who's idea was tms? #asktms
@scottjohnson I really wany to pull the trigger on Pillars but Sylvanas has me! First day one hero purchase.
@BlizzHeroes @ITNcast so 30min game got 400k exp and 75 gold with stimpack and 50% bonus! (Shouldn't have taken so long but team relaxed)
@ScrappySPJ still as dull as the first one then?
@eurogamer when is the Pillars of Eternity review going up?
@GarrettArt just count yourself lucky you're not in the uk where it's on the bloody news constantly. I just don't care anymore!
Spider drama downstairs is disturbing my evening!
@scottjohnson as long as they don't come back with a 3D @coverville logo!
@GarrettArt @BlizzHeroes yeah, first day one hero for me!! Also couldn't resist the on sale Azmo-dunk skin.
@straightinat101 @LoveCoffeeUK they won't let me put meshuggah on!
@thediabloshow Glorious!!!
@mgbarrett *bows*
@mgbarrett they've been stamped out...
@KellyMauger @1jamesbeattie remember when we got Hoddle sacked? Such sweet schadenfreude!!
@scottjohnson @nvidia that was fun, especially as I'm a fan of both parties(gtx770). Will be back next week (and Monday for TMS)
@sparklypips @MrsHipp0 hey bro, don't be all diss my shizzle yo yo innit blud!
@sparklypips @MrsHipp0 you two know about photos and shit, right?
@scottjohnson do share!
@mgbarrett and an acrobat!
@mgbarrett a gentleman
@scottjohnson will it be available to view afterwards as that's 2300 where I am :)
@ITNcast omfg I want tassadar now even though he sucks!!!!
Roofers have started on our new roof. Lie in ruined... #prayforsaintjw
@instanceshow I've been voting every day, even though you are dirty Horde! ;)
@ITNcast @BlizzHeroes you're still my 1st place!
@scottjohnson @BlizzHeroes this is because Azmodan is teh shizzle bra!! (40 and trying to sound street)
@scottjohnson awwww, look at ikle Scott!
@goffik one evening, maybe soon, you'll be sat in front of the tv. Maybe you're tired, it's been a long day. Then... Fast comes on... #mwaha
A successful (2&amp;2) evening of playing @BlizzHeroes and listening to #Mudvayne. Rehgar and Azmodan ftw!!
@coverville that Mudvayne cover was immense! Love The Police but that version added a whole load of blood and guts!
@scottjohnson over pursuing, I can hear @GarrettArt and @KyleFergusson tutting!!
@goffik the very first one is ok but after that then yeah, shite all the way!
@morningstream how can you talk about I Fought the Law without mentioning The Clash! Also nice fodder for the next penis mashup ;)
@BlizzHeroes @ITNcast Rehgar free rotation has me on the verge of splurging some gold! Most enjoyable support I've played so far.
@damianwalshe @VDubIsland gratz guys!!
@BeachyBooks wow, you have some interesting friends on Facebook!! Oh, cat videos... ;) #badumtish
@BeachyBooks there's a setting in Facebook to turn off autoplay for videos. Can't remember where exactly.
@scottjohnson I'm no pro gamer so one of the biggest things I like about @BlizzHeroes is that it's still fun when I'm losing. Azmo-dunk ftw!
@scottjohnson @pvponline @hawkito @SteveHamaker @scottyd @AngieKinSeattle @BlizzHeroes but you still had fun, right? Great thing about HotS!
I'll take that too!! #saintsfc
I'll take that!! Come on you #saintsfc!!!
All too easy... #saintsfc
@armorel_x petals?
@gredgie ketchup always makes me laugh, it's a constant sauce of amusement! #timvine
Told guy in sainsbury that my vinegar had lumps in. "They're pickled onions sir."

#badumtish #timvine
@WightHot Nordic Humanist? Someone's been playing Skyrim too much! (Ask @virtualranger)
@redsaintuk @Fellwolf sounds fishy, wish you'd stop carping on about it. I mean carpe diem folks! #badumtish
@scottjohnson phew! Was wondering why Azmodan wasn't slam dunk dealing death and suddenly realised #doh
@BlizzHeroes @scottjohnson so am I the only one who constantly presses the wrong set of keys when switching between Diablo and HotS?
@scottjohnson @acedtect it is a good yarn, unfortunately your cover is somewhat lost on my kindle.
@KyleFergusson @ITNcast Always Look on the Bright Side of Life?
@Coverville Kick &gt; X all day long! Bought Kick on vinyl when I was 13.
@scottjohnson disregard previous tweet, needed to force my podcast app to refresh. Boop show now where it should be.
@scottjohnson still getting tms instead of the boop show when downloading the podcast. Also tmspm hasn't appeared on the feed yet.
@scottjohnson just watched your HotS game vid. Man I felt for you when you died with 7 coins! Definitely like watching you play though.
@RAIDERS @CurtisLofton50 @royhelujr29 @MalcSmitty @MrDanWilliams Welcome to the #raidernation
@scottjohnson oh, I liked the straight to camera YouTube vid on HotS btw, more of this please!
@scottjohnson re hots cast, not sure it works in current form. Almost needs a separate caster to tell us what's happening when you go quiet.

 
@Littlemisskatyb Hobgoblins are bigger and much more dangerous than Goblins #d&amp;d #wastedyouth
@scottjohnson I have TONS of issues. Not with your website though... #badumtish
@JustinRYoung @shwood not listened to Night Attack before now, how could this have been done?!?
@morningstream re tmspm Scott I've seen Rush twice, about 20 years ago and 5 years ago and they were amazing both times. Just go see em'!!
@Coverville this is priceless! Kudos for posting it.
Got insta-spam style filters for my #Warcraft selfies now. Be afraid!! 
@scottjohnson Manic Miner has stuck in my head for over 30 years but SNES era Mario World and Zelda also awesome.
@morningstream another two hours? How much do I need to patreon for fatter tms?
@damianwalshe 
The future's so bright,
I gotta wear shades...

#namethattune
@morningstream I do like a long one!!
@acedtect enjoyed Citadel 32, seems like there are more stories to tell in that setting. Nice Voldemort reference too.
Phew!! #saintsfc
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!! #SAINTSFC
I've got more chance of scoring tonight and I've been married for 14 years... #saintsfc
Even Villa have scored... #saintsfc
@scottjohnson @The_T does it involve facetime? ;)
@instanceshow wow tokens? Wow!
@CaptainBeverage I was trying to be realistic but yeah, one of each configuration would be awesome!
@CaptainBeverage the rules for it are pretty sick too. Definitely want one for my Warriors of Chaos army.
@scottjohnson or at least if they do, they go regularly...
Well the kick-ball let me down, hooray for the egg-cgasers!! #saintsfc #wales #6nations
@aprilross977 phew!! Was watching it recorded as I was still at work.
A goal before the end of the season would be nice... #saintsfc
@acedtect will catch up on current geek, busy reading Citadel 32 atm. So far I'm intrigued!
@morningstream so apparently Melody likes your croaking voice even more! (Thanks btw, made her day :) )
He lived long and prospered. RIP Spock.
So people think ukip are racist because the media reports ukip candidates making racist comments? Yeah, nice one Mr Farrage! #blamethemedia
@morningstream Scott, can you say hello to my wife Melody, she loves the sound of your voice #asktms
LOLvren!! #europaleague
LOLvren!! #europakeague
@PolarIceQueen hey, you can legally smoke weed!
@morningstream this makes me sad. Hot lemon and honey and onwards!
@Splutbunwalla @redsaintuk I'm on fire! The smell of scorched fur isn't nice though.
@WightHot I'm pandering to my fans!
Obligatory selfie from World of #Warcraft! 
@scottjohnson next Boop your gonna have to explain it to me/us that missed it first time around. Ta :)
While someone on tv fell over, I did a lvl 20 Greater Rift in #Diablo 3 Season 2 on my Witch Doctor. Frankley you lot wasted your evening...


@thediabloshow I've had this one, it's not as exciting as it sounds! Only ever got blues and yellows.
@instanceshow I have pets?!? (Sarcasm yes but this is as much attention as I give them)
@redsaintuk how about a nice game of chess?
Couldn't score in a brothel... #saintsfc
THIS!!!!!!! RT @saints247: Need to ‘kin shoot #SaintsFC
I'll be surprised if we can muster a shot on target playing like this. Might manage a shot on Targett but that's about it... #saintsfc
@thediabloshow also you must mention we're getting all this for nowt extra, no subs, gratis etc! Got a WD to 70 in two hours earlier too.
@morningstream hey, you answered my question! This makes me happy. Also, how did you know I talked like that? ;)
@morningstream hey Scott, what's with the woolly hats? Is it cold in your studio? #asktms
@scottjohnson quote from the missus - can you turn down the sound from your game(d3), I can't hear Scott!
@morningstream guys, anyone with half a brain in the uk knows what kkk stands for. TMS on the other hand stands for Test Match Special!
@BoopShow w00t!!! I mean b00p!!!
@MintyMat The cake is a lie...

She thinks Flowers, when really…
@thediabloshow started a season 2 character, didn't bother with season 1, have played nothing else all day! Back on the D3 pony.
Violets are blue
Champions League places
Bottom half of league two

@scottjohnson Wilsoooooonnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!
@CaptainBeverage *something generic about kids, mortgages and costing loads of money*
@TheInstance wow, didn't expect quite that reaction to your collectables idea!
#50ShadesOfGreyMadeSFW #SlightlyNSFW 

#50ShadesofGreyMadeSFW



@redsaintuk clever considering it's not out for a few months...
@scottjohnson @acedtect @jenniej23 @jollyroger Samsung just let me know it was a good show! ;) #bigbrother #tinfoilhat
@ITNcast *vikings ;)
For some reason I felt like slaughtering Jedi after lunch... 
@GarrettArt @ITNcast got in a couple weeks back, listening to old shows and enjoying the changing game in reverse!
@goffik of course the earth is hollow, where else would our lord Satan live? And it's Him not this gravity thing that stops us floating away
@Altharus yeah lectures &gt; games sadly. Love Azmodan, spawn loads of creeps and lob fireballs across the map for insane damage!
@Altharus have it recorded for later viewing. Too busy playing hots!
@BoopShow we miss you, you know!
@morningstream yeah don't be daft, he's in the Bermuda Triangle with Lord Lucan!
Drinking manly pink raspberry cider! #apples
If I ever voluntarily decide to listen to Katie Melua, please feel free to book me into Dignitas.
Relieved and chuffed with that win! Was beginning to wonder when we'd score again! #saintsfc
Wales didn't deserve to win that. Didn't turn up second half.
Or not then...
Well that'll be that then.
Wales need to show up and prove themselves now.
No idea how it took England that long to take the lead, Wales haven't been in it second half so far!
Get in you beauty!!! #6nations #wales
@RAIDERS he should shake them up a bit!
@scottjohnson giant bag of animal crackers again?
@GarrettArt @ITNcast @KyleFergusson I actually want to try Malfurion now! Not so sure about Li Li mind..  ;)
@emmit93 yup
@scottjohnson 'course it's good, they're awesome! One of the few bands to successfully reinvent themselves after the loss of a major member.

In America, the measles come from insane parent-like peopl…
@scottjohnson they are subliminal messages telling you to tweet about the possibility of secret illuminati messages in superbowl ads... ;)
@rhodri someone at tesco has been reading Game of Thrones!
@b33rdy it's a sin... #badumtish
Ahh, a bit of pointless wrestling. Although wrestling is generally pointless anyway #superbowl
Gutted for Seattle but why not give the ball to Lynch at the 1 yard line? #superbowl
Well that's that then #superbowl
Squeaky bum time... #superbowl
@instanceshow mount Katy Perry? Well I never! ;)
They needed the 7 points there! #superbowl
Pressure told there! #superbowl
Decent half time show, makes a change! Now how about Steel Panther next year? #superbowl ;)
@ScrappySPJ and? ;)
Wardrobe malfunction time? #superbowl
@davechiv1 it's not the 4th quarter yet!
Nice pick! #superbowl
Some needle in this already! #superbowl
Ah yes, the Washington Antiquated Racial Slurs! #c4nfl #nfl
@ScrappySPJ @MattandCat and can we have a sticker for the vending machine? ;)
@redsaintuk so racist... ;)
I think Koeman is awesome but he sounds exactly like LVG did after the match at Old Trafford... #saintsfc
I recommend a course of leeches...
Well that wasn't predictable at all... #saintsfc
@davechiv1 they're making Arsenal look quite good!
@mgbarrett buy giving them a goal and playing like someone had changed the controls for fifa without telling the players!
This Villa side would have trouble scoring in a brothel!!
Turns out Murray's fiancé was the only one who brought her A game this morning!
Odd request of the day - "Can we sing as we go down the stairs?"
@saints247 sorry to see Jack go, not sorry to not have @AlanCork sticking his nose in every 30 seconds! Good luck Swansea!
Good luck to @jackcork1 at Swansea #saintsfc
@ITNcast well I'll be tucked up asleep as it'll be about 0200 over here but could you talk about who I should buy first with my gold? Ta!


@ITNcast so I started listening off the bat and stopped due to lack of context. But now I'm in the beta and playing while listening!
@saintcamel @redsaintuk soooooo cold that night!
(via @JoineeHo…
@redsaintuk @saintcamel I'm just depressed at my lack of options...
@scottjohnson @morningstream you mean you sound more laid back than usual? Is that possible? ;)
@saintcamel @redsaintuk I must've gone on my own then! I don't have any one else... #cries


@redsaintuk @Felna la boobs?
@redsaintuk @stupidwightman must've been @saintcamel then!
@Felna @redsaintuk le boobs?
@stupidwightman I've been to Blackburn with @redsaintuk to watch #saintsfc. We were losing 3-0 and it was still like a mausoleum!
"Don't you know who Macklemore is?!?"

I'm just surprised how surprised my daughter was!

@thediabloshow I haven't played in ages, since the season stuff started. How about an update/come back to d3 show?



(from @TwopTwips) 


@Felna @specialf @realrossnoble @ShanklinTheatre so as not to snag the levers!
@Felna @specialf @realrossnoble @ShanklinTheatre are you Mike the racist bus driver?
@iowct @MintyMat I wear that every day, it's just behind my apron!
@CivGame looks potentially good. I like the links with Beyond Earth.
Off to see @realrossnoble in a mo. I must remember to correct any grammar or pronunciation mistakes he makes, he loves that!
@adembskibowden I do i do I do-ooooooo!
@scottjohnson good luck dude!
Feeling a bit sleepy? Some lunchtime @Fear_Factory blasted directly into the brain will sort you out!
@LoveCoffeeUK @damianwalshe dangerous coffee/laptop proximity warning! ;)
@instanceshow I've had a (not constant) wow account for nearly 10 years. There's no way I'm paying £30 to get in the @BlizzHeroes beta!!
@davechiv1 it was but that's what happens when one has to squeeze 800 pages into three hours. Sort of the opposite of the Hobbit!
@davechiv1 Dune is about 4 times the size of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep though. Lynch made a valiant effort to fit it all in.
@morningstream that'll be my tomorrow morning kitchen prep company then!

Or [puts on shades] do you have to

[looks at camera]

Do you have …
@Teenski1 they are! I mean you could accidentally eat one and no one wants that!
@scottjohnson the Colts will need some Luck... #badumtish
Well fuck me I didn't expect that ending! #nfl
@MintyMat not #iwatch but #iliketowatch ...
@mgbarrett hehe!
@mgbarrett don't mention that in front of Republic of Ireland fans!
When singing along to Slàinte Mhath, one must do so in a Scottish accent #marillion
Don't know what Gardos was supposed to do there. He made a decision and was unlucky #saintsfc
@cwcrawley do you expect me to talk? No Mr @virtualranger, I expect you to look suave and drink alcohol!
Winning with lucky goals and dodgy decisions? We must be a big club! Come on you #saintsfc!!!
@CaptainBeverage Hello Kitty Roller Rescue?
@gredgie it was meant affectionately! ;)
@BeachyBooks "I Predict Discrepancies" isn't as catchy as "I Predict a Riot" tbh... ;)
Well a wins a win! #saintsfc
Wanyama ouch :( #saintsfc
@BlizzardCSEU_EN @BlizzHeroes just need an invite now!
"Just the news!"
"Uh huh" 
@tikkabootwo @emmit93 @LilyWestPATD
@scottjohnson so standing or sitting for tms tomorrow? (If you're not in too much pain and shizzle)
@saintcamel was pretty nerve wracking! Van Gaal in denial was quite funny though!
Can we call them ManHoof now? #motd
@stupidwightman boom!
We are Southampton and we never* win on Sky!

*Except at Old Trafford where we hadn't won in the league for 27 years! #saintsfc
Impressed with Gardos performance, not an easy situation to be thrust into but was solid all afternoon #saintsfc
Get in you beauties!!!! #saintsfc
@wighterstones Issac Azimov - this was my high school reading list so far! Heinlen next?
@wighterstones HG Wells, what do I win? ;)
@MattandCat the things I do for publicity...
@WightHot @redsaintuk sounds like something they'd make a right pig's ear of!
@redsaintuk not if I buy them all first!
@redsaintuk Sir Porky of Scratching, g/r pig. Tap and pay gr to make target card delicious!
@scottjohnson oh yeah, feel the burn! (The fact that you're a mere 3 years older than me is irrelevant;))
@scottjohnson maybe they've seen your YouTube vids! ;)
@MattandCat But I can't see the pork scratchings!
@ScrappySPJ you know you've stolen his soul now? I'm not sure I'd want it tbh... ;)
@mgbarrett hey Bart, do you like my new chainsaw and ice hockey mask?
@redsaintuk @goffik there must be some kinda way outta here, said the joker to the thief...
Lots of support for free speech in France. Less mention of being arrested if the police don't like what you tweet in the UK.


@BeachyBooks don't lie, you were already holding the banjo!
@BeachyBooks from what I've seen on twitter/Facebook we are!
@CaptainBeverage bravo!
@mgbarrett oh, yeah I suppose. Bloody optimists!!
@mgbarrett I hold you entirely responsible for today's result! (And the players but mainly you!) ;)
@CaptainBeverage 30 hours in and I'm still just scratching the surface I think. Big things have occurred and I am suitably impressed!
@BoopShow about 30 hours into DA Inquisition. It has consumed me. I love it! Logged into wow once since I got it. Great @instanceshow  btw.
@MrJamesMay handbag holder, surprised you didn't know!
@StephenMangan say backpack, say backpack!!!
@The_T congratulations to you both!
Pearson talking a lot of sense. Makes Mourinho's conspiracies sound childish #motd
Get in you #saintsfc!!!
@mgbarrett beef jerky time, want some?
@scottjohnson I might have to dust it off and charge it up!
@scottjohnson I've not bought anything for my vita for about a year!
@scottjohnson you don't get off that easy! Looking forward to the resumption of podcasting.
@scottjohnson catching up on last tms before Christmas prompted an impromptu kitchen sing a long to Caravan of Love! Was a big hit in the UK
@scottjohnson how did you dispose of the body? Buried in the Nevada desert mafia style? ;)
@CaptainBeverage yup, just did a load of war table, crafting and upgrades and went to a new area. Think I'm hooked, only took 10 hours!
Don't care how we get them - Touchdown #raidernation!!!
@ScrappySPJ @davechiv1 it had Orks? Why wasn't I told? I thought it just had boring Orcs! (40k spelling joke ftw)
I'll take that tbh!! #saintsfc
Too easy for Hazard #saintsfc
Poised for another opportunity to break the Sky jinx. Against Chelsea.  Ho hum #saintsfc
@CaptainBeverage only one bear so far. It did give me paws for thought though...
@CaptainBeverage I keep happening across groups of uber tough baddies and get railroaded back into the centre of the map. And elfroot.
@scottjohnson Yes!!!!
@clairepack I won't let Lily watch it. It's too traumatic!
@clairepack I can't watch that!
@CaptainBeverage have you got a conversation wheel in your head? Played about 2 hours, still getting used to the controls!
@straightinat101 @LoveCoffeeUK closed Boxing Day, open Saturday.
@CH0L0K @BeachyBooks the current one is supposed to be good. Diablo 3 is the closest imho, masses of mobs and random dungeons.
DA:Inquisition on offer on Origin, do I pull the trigger?
Dr Who was pretty good but have escaped midwife/miranda/eastenders to Civ Beyond Earth and Alter Bridge.
@BeachyBooks @CH0L0K traps make walls dissappear!
Headcrab Zombies!! #drwho
@George_0Brien sounds like a normal day!
@gredgie does one have to be a naysayer if one was bored enough by the first to not bother with the next two?
@scottjohnson ummmmm...
Feeling hungry? #Tuck in to some #Buffalo QB! #raidernation
Khalil Mack and Charles Woodson are the young and old glue hold this defence together #raidernation
Charles Woodson - awesome player #raidernation
Happy Rush Day!! #2112
Many thanks to Everton for their continued generosity! Nothing like a 3-0 to take the bad midweek taste away! #saintsfc
@instanceshow I was going to do a warcraft podcast but now I don't have to! ;)
@b33rdy yup @Xbox synonymous with reliability!
@scottjohnson and look down your nose at them daft yanks! ;) (I don't really, some of you are actually quite nice ;) )
@WightHot ok #fella!
Micky Mouse Cup etc... #saintsfc
"Chromatic scenes of hostages fleeing..." I'm reasonably sure that subtitle was supposed to be "dramatic" but they were in colour too.
@MarkDuaneMorton drugs are bad, m'kay?


Good old Seabass! #raidernation
"To Mekip." - The Chuckle Brothers discuss politics.
@scottjohnson I'm sticking to Stance of the Fierce Tiger, increases all my damage by 10% so it's all good ;)
@iowct they all said I'm too old!
@MintyMat *awaits angry folk tweeting about pointless self publicists*
@iowct my daughter was 15 in August, do I win? ;)
"No, it's Christmas."
The problem with Mad Max is that the idea was always much better than the films could achieve. The films are actually pretty pants.
Well fucking fucky fuck. Give away two shit goals and waste almost every opportunity going forward #saintsfc
@straightinat101 this will be available from 0800 tomorrow morning.
Call me pessimistic but I'll take 10 minutes of being in the lead as progress!! #raidernation
@ScrappySPJ like the last Toy Story long, except for Spanish Buzz.
@straightinat101 I went to the Harry Potter Studios tour yesterday, it was amazing!
@CaptainBeverage Nobody expects the Dragon Age Inquisition!
@gredgie digital coffee delivery it the future!
@chardr27 @ScrappySPJ @redsaintuk I'd see a doctor if I had eight boils... #badumtish
Forced to drink Steam coffee, not impressed. Old fella sat next to me on the boat called me "young folk". I like old people!
Doctor: No.
Had chances again and didn't take them. City and Arsenal have been clinical when needed and Utd will be too #saintsfc
Squad starting to look very thin... #saintsfc
Need to take our chances or this will be Man City all over again!! #saintsfc
@PlayOverwatch London? Really? Nobody from London talks like that!!!
@instanceshow first heroic down, everbloom's technicolor fronds are defeated! Earliest I've done heroics since TBC too.
@sparklypips I've found counting while breathing in and out can help distract the brain enough and helps you relax too.
(via @Swissss)
@gredgie bet it wasn't the best singalong in the world...
@cwcrawley @MrsHipp0 smooth!
A. The GofuckyoursElf.
@scottjohnson @BoopShow it's only fair, you do make good stuff!
@BeachyBooks just did and @tikkabootwo didn't suspect a thing!
@AdamSchefter upgrade from Johnny Sideline?



(via @relatabledad) 
@Teenski1 sometimes I'm allowed to go home, sometimes... ;)
Was wondering, new start or flash in the pan? Flash in the pan then... #raidernation
New kick return guy, not surprised #raidernation
(via @thepoke)
I blame sky... #saintsfc
First day of week off, internet dies. WHY CRULE FATE, WHY DO YOU MOCK ME?!? *sobs uncontrollably*
@MrEdByrne alternatively 
@damianiw no Jar Jar? Denied!!!
So new film will have x-wings, lightsabres and the Millennium Falcon in it. Did we really need a teaser for that? #obviously
Somewhere there's a team about to become the focus of the #nfl and sports news for all the wrong reasons...
@scottjohnson shave and colonoscopy by the expression! ;)


I see the pre - hype hype to hype up the hype has begun...

A long time ago in a marketing office far, far away...
@iowct groady to the max!!
@iowct sure thing, bud!
@iowct yeah, "Happy Holidays!!!!"
@scottjohnson re tms 722 - Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing will always be those old guys from Star Wars to my generation.
@instanceshow hit a wall, garrison stuff all queued and no quests left. Don't always have time to q for dungeons, left twiddling thumbs.
@mgbarrett what about us drunken slobs?
@MattandCat @MatthewWinkles for future reference, it is always the right time for a pot noodle!
@Teenski1 I don't look like Hagrid? I am dissapoint!!
Still second, still best defensive record. Curse of Sky half broken #saintsfc
Well that was poor and we're lucky to get a point #saintsfc
GET THE FUCK IN CLYNE!!!! #SAINTSFC
Well this is a bit shit #saintsfc
@ridjb never let it be said we're not charitable!
Here you go Villa, have a goal on us! #saintsfc #ffs
Come on you #saintsfc!!!
Just listened to 30 seconds of political chat at the bar in the pub. We're all doomed.
@emmit93 so's ya face!
@mattdawhit do you have cheesy voice-over now?
@ScrappySPJ @UKNFL Texans backup qb looked shaky at best!
@ScrappySPJ EAT MY GOAL!!
@straightinat101 keep it up!!
Chuffed for Lewis Hamilton, hilarious result for LiverpooLOL!!
@iowct @WightHot That was an awesome year!
@instanceshow Gratz!!
@gredgie RAIDERS WIN!!!
@gredgie RAIDERS WON!!!!
RAIDERS WIN!!!!! #RAIDERNATION
@custard1980 @mattdawhit hey hey, leave me out of the domestic folks!! ;)
@custard1980 fish finger butties are awesome! The question is - 3, 4 or 5 per butty? (The correct answer is 5)
@instanceshow if I was on I'd just wax lyrical about the Spires of Arak story. Best story and quest line in a long time!
@KellyMauger I sat next to @FrannyBenali on the boat back to the IOW after a 0-0 draw against Everton at The Dell an age ago!
@scottjohnson I'll definitely play DA:I but now WoD is King! And has a castle.
@instanceshow @Warcraft folk on my server still complaining. I think 5 days is pretty fair tbh.
@instanceshow that's the Horde for ya... ;)
@BlizzardCSEU_EN Kilrogg World Server Down trying to login based at my garrison.
@instanceshow start all quests as soon as they're available. To do otherwise would require planning and memory!
@CaptainBeverage that's a shame, alternate universe you was hilarious!
@CaptainBeverage well it's all relative isn't it...
@WightHot @Felna he needed to hear the truth...
@scottjohnson cheers, I'd prefer something savoury though tbh ;)
@redsaintuk first play fumbled snap, still in it so far though.
#facepalm #raidernation
@MintyMat you're just milking it now....
@instanceshow quests, scenarios, garrisons and cut scenes making this live like no other expansion! Goosebumps watching Prophet Valen!
@MrsHipp0 "It's Isobella Rosollini, I'm just disappointed I don't got popcorn!"

(via @ben_cameron)
@straightinat101 Happy Birthday!
@Warcraft I love this game and I know you folks do too and thus I have every confidence you'll sort it out :)
@instanceshow Transfer Aborted: instance not found *cries*. Garrisons on EU servers are barely functional atm.
@instanceshow w00t!!! (My phone predicted w00t when replying to you!)


A: Nothing. FIFA stands for absolutely nothing.
@instanceshow Do not listen to the False Prophet DDOS!!
@mgbarrett #areyouthereyet
@instanceshow Transfer Aborted: instance not found. Rinse and repeat. (I know it's launch day etc)
@stupidwightman wrong Sepp Blatter and the Russian and Qatar FA say it all the time!
@BlizzardCSEU_EN can't move, dead, disconnect as soon as I try to move.
@instanceshow world server down ftw it seems! Going to try again in the morning.
@scottjohnson it is here! Oh yeah!!
@scottjohnson obviously none of this will stop me playing the hell out of it!
@scottjohnson yeah, it's like scratching a blackboard! Doesn't help that on US tv we're either cockney or royalty. Looks amazing though!
@scottjohnson @PlayOverwatch she's awesome, just not the voice acting!
@scottjohnson @PlayOverwatch as long as they can drop the Dick van Dyke Cockney lass's voice!! Blimey crikey guv'nor!
@scottjohnson Heroic Heirloom Polearm from Garrosh done. Cloak done. Why isn't it Thursday yet?!?
@straightinat101 sorry, bed to comfy now ;)
@straightinat101 most kc fans are in Kansas I expect ; )
@MintyMat @ScrappySPJ I just put a black circle in the middle of my helmet, does that count?
@gredgie 4 hours, remember!
@clairepack don't we always win? ;)
@PlayOverwatch game looks amazing although you have created the worst "cockney accent" since Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins!
@scottjohnson :)
Oh dear... #drwho
@scottjohnson is it being streamed?
I wonder if Mourinho will be asked about being 8 points clear of City today on #motd? #saintsfc
@redsaintuk WOW OMG THAT FIRST 30 SECONDS WAS AMAZING!!!!! ;)
Chuffed for Shane Long! #saintsfc
@sdenness2000 @mgbarrett sold as seen, no returns! ;)

"Certainly sir, here you are."

"Could I have a different one?"

"Why?"

"This one has Staines o…
@sdenness2000 @75wingnut @LoveCoffeeUK we do deliver, just not in the geographical sense!
@WightHot @MintyMat @Kierenisboring surely you didn't need #iwcptotw to realise my superiority ;)
@75wingnut @sdenness2000 @LoveCoffeeUK hmmmmm, coffee!! *gargle gargle*
@MintyMat @Kierenisboring oh cool, I've won twice! I had no idea how superior I am! (That's a lie, I know I'm superior) ;)
@scottjohnson @VoiceOfOBrien looks like You Were Prepared! ;)
@scottjohnson I hate you! (Not really, I'm insanely jealous though)
@gredgie I WANT TO PLAY IT CAUSE BLIZZARD!!!!!11111oneone Is that wrong of me?
#overwatch #blizzcon #squee
@George_0Brien consider that a diworce!
This is not an 0-16 team. One win will bring more but just need to get that win #raidernation
Back in this game, daring to hope... #raidernation
@imagnocean it's the same old same old.
@ScrappySPJ someone else's deck by the sounds of it!
Penalties and poor tackling #standard #raidernation
Well we're on the board! #raidernation
Watching Philly @ Houston because JJ Watt #nfl
@redsaintuk no thaiku?
@MarkDuaneMorton can recognise my little ponies on sight?
Citeh grinding out a win against plucky mid - table Utd...

@CaptainBeverage take some paracetamol and listen to some Def Lepoard - Job Done!
#Liverpool 
@Littlemisskatyb well I say!
@instanceshow listened last night, I should be more patient before hassling!
Wanyamaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! #saintsfc
@TheInstance loved the parodies at the end of the show, made me giggle. Not as good as the Sound of Silence one from a while ago mind.
@goffik I don't feel a misery at all. I don't buy into it, it's an Americanism too far.


@goffik I'm with you, I'm wearing my "bloke who doesn't give a fuck about Halloween" costume!
Watching #nfl with Neeeessaaaaaan and Maaaaaahzda. Not sure if they're the same as Nissan and Mazda but hey!
@instanceshow is there a show this week?
What's the equivalent to bah humbug for Halloween?
@saintcamel just watched highlights, stunning first goal and clinical second. Forster should've saved their first tbh. Def red card too.
@saintcamel 72 seconds between crouch's cards!
@saintcamel that was some tense injury time!
*phew* #saintsfc
@ScrappySPJ shields on double front!
@scottjohnson @BoopShow you're going to talk about Civ Beyond Earth I hope?
@toymaker1980 @CaptainBeverage fuck me, you're still alive! ;)
Now down by 10 in the 4th. No confidence our offense can get this back, 0-7 #raidernation
Moving the ball on offense, about to break a big play, fumble, Browns ball at our 30. It's almost physically painful to watch #raidernation
Well that play pretty much sums up our season #raidernation
C-Wood still got it! #raidernation
Standard pass and runs gain 1st downs. Wildcat trick plays and fakes stall the drive! #raidernation
@stupidwightman really? What the hell have you been eating!?! ; )
@scottjohnson true story, my local is The Golden Dragon Palace!
@redsaintuk yes
@CaptainBeverage bravo sir!
Vaguely interesting premise spoiled by nonsensical technobabble plot.
@redsaintuk I will punish myself later!
@redsaintuk sorry, been a busy day!
@iowct 1-0 barely seems to qualify as a win now... #spoilt
Only 1-0? I expect an apology from Koeman! #saintsfc #crisis #meltdown
@scottjohnson also my wife finds your voice relaxing.
@scottjohnson just listened to my first current geek and watched the live stream for the first time too. I was entertained, good job.
@armorel_x nope you're not. It's a complete waste of time and just gives oiks an excuse to be dicks.
@scottjohnson Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!
@cwcrawley most definitely, ditch the Horde scum!
@eurogamer Civ Beyond Earth review imminent?
Introduced a friend to Robin Hobb, had to correct them when they said,"His writing is amazing!"
@BlizzardCSEU_EN "world server down" all evening on Kilrogg. Can't even stay logged in long enough to make a ticket about lost crafting mats
@MattandCat you must've been egg-cited to shell out for that! #puns #essential
@instanceshow Sad But True...



(from @Notts_Skeptics) 
@81TimBrown last two games showed a lot of promise, just need that first win! #raidernation
@CaptainBeverage another point nearer safety... ;) #enjoyitwhileitlasts
Officials making shit up now #raidernation
@davechiv1 very dodgy late call went against them too. Although they did put themselves in a hole early.
@ScrappySPJ @redsaintuk the less they have to rely on Romo, the more consistent they'll be.
Finally Touchdown #Raiders!!! D-Mac from 3 yards #raidernation
@ScrappySPJ @redsaintuk curse working ok so far! Also Carson Palmer making former teams look a bit daft.
@gredgie one of us! One of us!
@ScrappySPJ positive energy maaaaaan!
So after #saintsfc's 8-0 win, what are the chances of a blowout win for the #Raiders vs #Cardinals later? Too much to ask for?
@imagnocean we'll let you off! Happy Anniversary!
@stupidwightman don't you 8 it when that happens? ; )
@ScrappySPJ it is both sublime and ridiculous!
@redsaintuk bet they've got to be careful which dj they show introducing that!
@redsaintuk the episode was ok
@instanceshow finally got my second Legendary Cloak on my Boomkin. Mainly due to massive, possibly unintentional nerfing, of Wrathion fight!
@redsaintuk oh yeah, feel the burn!
@Teenski1 with or without my magic wand?
@MintyMat it's a side effect of shrinking and growing, no known cure sadly.
Surely Clara's safe, she's already a two dimensional character! #drwho
Surely Clara's safe, she's already a two dimensional character! #drhwo
@Justgosailing there's too much of Clara, full stop!
@SallyBarfoot he was ok, Terry Henry is always good.
@SallyBarfoot I can't stand any of them tbh, I mute the in between parts!
Well it only took 8 goals to get on #motd first!! #saintsfc
Really 8 to bang on... 
@damianiw yeah, I just haven't got the patience for all the sneaking!
Two Sunderland own goals?  Did they get confused by our red and white stripes? 

#saintsfc
What's a Sunderland fan's favourite Hives track?

8 to Say I Told You So...

#saintsfc #comeonyoureds
To Nurgle or not to Nurgle, that is the question... #whfb
@scottjohnson inconceivable!!!
@gredgie genuine my dear boy!
Oh coffee, how I love thee
@AdamSchefter another blow out on the cards?
@gredgie @specialf this is a #truefact
@BoopShow BOOP!
@mattletiss7 @QuestionofSport I remember the first time you were on, old format and all that. Didn't you throw a ball of paper at someone?
@mgbarrett can they fix it?
@specialf this is punishment for using the word holibobs! ;)

@gredgie yeah, you gets used to it.

Get the fuck in!!! #raidernation
@gredgie remember to seek medical advice if it lasts more than four hours!
@RAIDERS @nfl AT LONG LAST!!
@CaptainBeverage @henningwehn  he cracks me up!
I'm thinking (hoping) Carr to Jones is going to be a thing! #raidernation
Derrick Carr is a good player but isn't being helped by all the drops! #raidernation
77 yard td? I'll take that to start! #raidernation
@CaptainBeverage live comedy is awesome
Toto Wolff is such a cool guy. Tell it like it is Toto!
@AddmannIW Obama doesn't need sporting events to boost his profile! Besides Texas has Cowboys and Texans to watch on Sundays too.
@AddmannIW an excerise in tedium.
Russian gp is a sellout apparently. Nothing mentioned about two thirds of the track having no spectator facilities.
@scottjohnson but seriously, what is he after?!? ;)
@CaptainBeverage but which version? Original? Director's cut? Extended? Cheesy voice over? Surreal ending? Incomplete info dude! ;)
@mgbarrett The Royal Penis is clean...
If only this episode was called Throw Clara From the Train...
@mgbarrett @mattdawhit there's actually a very sad, shameful reason for that particular Simpson's song...

It was that or shoot my chauffeurs..
See my vest, see my vest,

New badge for work! @LoveCoffeeUK 
@BeachyBooks @Coweschainferry especially if coming from East Cowes... ;)
@BeachyBooks my thoughts too. The kids and I have enjoyed the films so far as well.
First Stew of the Season! #stew
Slovakia can score on Spain in 20 mins but England can't score on San Marino in 20 mins?
@MrsHipp0 @cwcrawley Hey, hey, I'm walkin' here! Are you lookin' at me? Are you lookin' at ME?
@Teenski1 was the house guilty?
@emmit93 you have a child?!? ;)


@Teenski1 if only the same was true of @davechiv1 !
Glanced at tv, ebola report is on. It's The End of the World As We Know It starts on shop stereo. *dons tinfoil hat, stands back and waits*
@MrsHipp0 @cwcrawley I demand you heckle!! ;)
@Clert do you have a penchant for it?
@scottjohnson first record I ever bought was the Theme to Fraggle Rock on 7" vinyl!
@mgbarrett @sdenness2000 I like songs about big butts and I cannot lie...


@Teenski1 @imagnocean @LoveCoffeeUK I'm not even dressed my dear, not that that stops me from saying hello!
@Felna I couldn't stand him or Ace, I was glad when they put it out of it's misery!
@Felna but still better than McCoy though.
@cwcrawley actually I nicked it all out of blind jealousy. I'm wearing that jacket you bought, doesn't suit me tbh!
@Felna I could ignore that if not for her too tbh but yeah it's a symptom of the poor writing.
Oh ffs just get rid of Clara fucking Oswald!!!
@instanceshow a massive yes from me! (I did vote but you know, belt and braces!)
@BoopShow w00t!
@daraobriain new kid was good!
@ridjb THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS!!!
@scottjohnson @BoopShow cool, need some non review type feedback on this and I like your style dude!
Question of the Day - "Do you do Nescafe?"

#facepalm
THIS!!!!! RT @SciencePorn: Morning walk then and now. 
@Battlefield great update.  
Only taken nearly a year but hey ho.
@BoopShow cool, you can tell me what it is as I don't get it so far!
I don't think Dennis Allen is by far the sole reason for the #Raiders terrible start but it's a bit more difficult to fire half the players!
@CaptainBeverage Jar Jar Binks!!!
@ScrappySPJ vhs? Trying to fit one nfl game on a 3hr tape? #goodolddays
@ScrappySPJ that's one of the (sickly) funniest parts!! #boom
@CaptainBeverage Calamity Jane?
@CaptainBeverage it was quite a piece of individual skill I must admit!
@CaptainBeverage ah, so you can constantly slide tackle with Rooney until he gets a red? ;)
@scottjohnson or just listen to The Colour and the Shape? (I do like later stuff but they peaked early imho)
@CaptainBeverage don't know what this says about the rest of destiny!
@ScrappySPJ it was dead at the half, I'm impressed you made it so far!
Time for some Garbage Time Offense!!! #raidernation
@ScrappySPJ He contradicted himself on how he was going to make selections and dropped in form players. The player's lost but he didn't help
@ScrappySPJ Lily may have been called Tim if she'd been a boy. One of my all time favourites.
Tim Brown talking sense #raidernation
Awesome, just awesome #raidernation
@ridjb keep your perversions to yourself!
That first drive was just a trick to give me hope!! #raidernation
Sigh #raidernation
Ahhh the comedy tackling is back! #raidernation
@imagnocean he's big fat lump that treads on me at 3am! But yes he is a cutie.
The nfl has been playing at Wembley for a few years now, can we drop the assumption that all viewers don't know the game? #channel4 #nfl
Touchdown #Raiders!!! Offence looking awesome, finally clicking! #raidernation
Someone knows there's leftover chicken in his very near future... 
@mgbarrett they're waffely versatile!
This! RT @mattletiss7: Are there any other saints fans who can't stop staring at the league table this morning? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mattletiss7 yup!
@StephenMangan has she dressed as a daffodil?
@mgbarrett don't let standards slide... ;)
The crisis continues!!! Still 2nd, enjoying it while it lasts! #saintsfc
@scottjohnson but are you going to play it over Diablo?
@scottjohnson soooooo much lunch money wasted....
@scottjohnson I see they're being true to the arcade original. You couldn't have two or more of the same class until Gauntlet 2.
@Teenski1 well actually he can't burst out Alien style as they burst through ones chest, hence chest burster #pedant #geek ;)
@BoopShow Mutant League Hockey!!!
@CaptainBeverage it's certainly hard to beat... #badumtish
@instanceshow STICK TO THE GODDAM SUBJECT!! Actually don't, I find your collective ramblings entertaining.
@ScrappySPJ oh how I look forward to your commentary on anything past season 1! ;) ( Seriously, just watch season 1 and forget the rest)

@mattdawhit @Coweschainferry #ooer #fnarrr #winkwink #saynomore
Ah the crisis, this wonderful crisis, continues!! #saintsfc
@instanceshow an official nail in the coffin, not at all surprised.
I've figured it out! Kevin Keegan has had extensive plastic surgery to look like Van Gaal and is exacting his revenge!!
@mgbarrett can I get an e-bong on credit?
@Felna it's #hereallweek
@Felna I tried to shave a design once but it was such a pain to keep tidy...
@ScrappySPJ nor were the Jets or Texans but we still managed to be far more inept than we were today.
@tomofwight it went down, down, down and the flames went higher. 
And it burns, burns, burns,
Ring of fire, ring of fire!
@virtualranger @MintyMat or just continually travel the island looking at lamp posts? #nothelpfull
Although we're going to lose this, being still in the game with 0.51 left is a rather big slice of progress #raidernation
Tuck in to some juicy sacks, Justin!  #raidernation
@Surprisedzoe @ScrappySPJ @mgbarrett look, there goes a fwaggle!!
@ScrappySPJ @Surprisedzoe @mgbarrett the first single I bought was the Theme to Fraggle Rock.
@mgbarrett it's one of my Bare Necessities....
@CaptainBeverage enjoying it while it lasts!
Raiders defence holding twice in a row? Has some pride seeped into our team? #raidernation
@CaptainBeverage you must be very fond of a defence of any kind atm... ;)
Early days but the ex #saintsfc player schadenfreude is particularly exquisite at the moment!
@ScrappySPJ never underestimate the importance of comfortable slippers.
@Justgosailing show off!! I got none, my step daughter got Shrek.
@mgbarrett yup, this asset stripping fire sale has ruined us.
@mgbarrett I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!
@redsaintuk can't cope man!
Crisis #saintsfc 
(via @Bromptonite)
@instanceshow w00t!!
@scottjohnson or Lady Highgarden?
@goffik the referendum had actual consequences, the general election doesn't.
@CaptainBeverage @Mattcweekes  Have I Got News For You &gt; everything mentioned so far.
@instanceshow hearing fellow 40 year old @ChrisMetzen talking about Dragonlance and Dan Abnett stuff makes him even cooler ever.
Not only wall to wall media coverage, now meaningless platitudes.
@instanceshow @ChrisMetzen so chuffed you've done this!
@scottjohnson you look thinner...
@SalmonSilly @Teenski1 I do now but didn't click at the time!
The few times I've had a migraine, the thought of looking at computer/phone screen to tweet about it would've made me throw up #justsayin
@scottjohnson re Instance message - dude it's all cool.
@CaptainBeverage pointed sticks and harsh language.
@adembskibowden washes aren't pleasant either, hate to think how much agrax earthshade I've ingested!
Another potentially good drive blown on some basic ball handling errors #raidernation
@RAIDERS *sigh*
@davechiv1 last solid album was There is Nothing Left to Lose.
The Texans have passed on every 3rd down so far. Are none of the #Raiders coaching staff watching the same game as me?
@mattdawhit you're being far too nice!
@mattdawhit have you explained that following you is an entirely voluntary thing and they are more than welcome to change that if required?
@ScrappySPJ that's quite amusing!
Comedy tackling from the #Raiders. This is going to be a long season if we're going back to that old chestnut #raidernation
@CaptainBeverage well it's important that Utd beat the teams around them... ;)
@dankiz1 I didn't hear anything about visas so not sure on that. Him and J-Rod to come is cool.
@dankiz1 was only just back from international duty so was rested.
@scottjohnson get a grip!
Toby Alderweireld looks like an excellent signing, even if I can't pronounce his name yet! #saintsfc
@specialf @Teenski1 I'm sure @davechiv1 would hold it. The torch I mean...
Actually pretty good episode then.
Potentially good episode in danger of disappearing up it's own arse.
@mgbarrett popoye!
Sell three goal scorers, no problem.

#saintsfc 
@cwcrawley @gredgie Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!
@gredgie oh no, @cwcrawley has infected your tweets with eeeeeeecms stuff!!!! ;)
@Teenski1 @SalmonSilly did a double take!
This crisis malarkey is great!! #saintsfc
@MintyMat good work. The angle you're at now I'd say it's a good job you already have kids! ;)


@tomofwight have you met any wizards? From the moon maybe?
Oh dear, the episode of DS9 with Iggy Pop.
@Kirstie_SFC @mattletiss7 the couple of times I met him at signings I just grinned like a goon!
Based on U2`s recent output, I'd want itunes to credit my account with at least a tenner before I download their latest album!
@scottjohnson I haven't seen a watch by anyone that does anything I want. I'd rather just have a nice watch watch.
*looks at nice big phone screen I've had for the last three years*
Instead of watching footy I've been doing this - 
Excellent news! I look forward to the press hounding another hospital employee to suicide!
@ScrappySPJ that sucks. I've shelled out for the regular season online this year.
@ScrappySPJ anything on the nfluk site?
@mguiowfc defence looked massively better than last season and Carr looked promising but the ground game was poor #raidernation
@ScrappySPJ late Sunday game is on c4 but 5live seem to have dropped it.
Raiders defence playing pretty well considering they've had no help from the offence #raidernation #Raiders
Raiders need a long drive on offence to give this d-line a breather #raidernation
Jets are racking up Raider penalty numbers!
First NFL TD pass for Derek Carr #raidernation
Yes! C.Wood you beauty! #raidernation
Rookie qb Derek Carr starting for the #Raiders in about 20 mins. Getting settled in for an evening of NFL! #raidernation
Toto Wolfe tells it like it is.
Roseberg bottles it, beautiful!
Things are going to occur very soon #f1 #bbcf1
@ridjb no the World Health Organisation!
When's he going to ditch Clara?
@CaptainBeverage you remember the old pre heresy game? Well today I got the Forge World Mortarian model! Scary details on it!
@scottjohnson dang, just remembered no instance this week!
@scottjohnson well it always used to be the pub, dose this count as progress?
@paulcruse66 first listen is promising, an evolution from Heritage.
THAT'S how you do deadline day! #saintsfc
Today I tried to buy things locally but ended up buying online due to availability and extortionate cost.
Gaston has done little in the time he's been at #saintsfc. A bit disappointed to see him off as he always seemed to have promise.
New Opeth album time.
@Loubylouise @SouthamptonFC congratulations!
Just driven new car this evening, rather enjoyed it! First automatic I've driven in a long while, so relaxing.
@Teenski1 @davechiv1 quit your moaning, I've managed it for years!
@redsaintuk @WightHot @Grievy pompey are a grotty joke. There you go, job done.
Lots of Dutch players in the Prem and Dutch managers also.
@saintcamel he was more humble than usual but still had to get one whine in! Still big questions over Schniederlin too, we'll see monday!
Time for Fat Sam's excuses! #motd
@crstig if it's so good, why hoof the ball over it constantly!
@scottjohnson sweet, evenings listening sorted. After new Dr Who of course.
@Teenski1 I wouldn't buy it, he knows nothing... ;)
First chance to say GET IN YOU #SAINTSFC!!!
@Tracypolexoxo I thought it might be a bit Alien for you... ;)
@Tracypolexoxo or yutani... 
(I'll be impressed if you get this)
@RAIDERS preseason is all good but a week sunday I'll be glued to the computer, watching online in the UK! Global #raidernation
@Felna well my case should arrive Friday, I'll be on their, um, case if not!
Just realised my new KR figure case is being delivered by UPS, help me @Felna , tell me it'll be ok!
@FamblyGuy as long as you "remember" to limp occasionally...
@iowct I once bought something with Kate's bush in it but that was entirely different...
@SouthamptonFC love the subtext in this!
@CaptainBeverage there's never a good time to Don a ManU shirt... ;)
Decent result for #saintsfc but MK Dons fans must be feeling like they've taken some hallucinogenic substances!
@armorel_x have you not heard of Cava or Prosecco?
Waits for half of Facebook to change profile pictures...
Maybe Malky Mackay should talk to Ron Atkinson about how to rebuild his football career. Oh, wait...
@scottjohnson currently reading Century Rain by Alastair Reynolds, has a very similar split of future humans.
@imagnocean not all they're cracked up to be!! #badumtish #hereallweek
@Felna I concur
Reading Century Rain by @AquilaRift and the shit has really just hit the fan!
Promising and frustrating in equal measure #saintsfc
@scottjohnson @instanceshow I shall listen while playing the WoD Beta.
Gotta love Stephen Berkov chewing the scenery in #ds9
@goffik I'm persistent, if nothing else!
I must say whoever is operating the ex #saintsfc player voodoo dolls is doing a bang up job!
@goffik it took about five attempts but eventually I managed to smash my HTC One screen. Still works mind.
Also tons of free advertising and publicity for said tabloids #golfclap
The #irony of posting pictures of front pages to show one's outrage in exactly the same way as said tabloids do.
@scottjohnson @BoopShow damn you, why do you have to wait until I've just gone to bed? I don't mind really, boop tomorrow night for me.
Why do I get blank looks when I ask what Gul Dukat is up to when @emmit93 and @tikkabootwo are watching Keeping Up with the Cardassians?
@CaptainBeverage can I have the Cream of Sum Yung Guy?
@FamblyGuy had a guy on a bike stop directly opposite our house a few days ago and barf. Twice. At dinner time. Didn't even get off the bike
@AquilaRift George Lucas did and look where it led! We should've seen Jar Jar a mile off...
Innings win with Broad in hospital is even more impressive! #engvind
@mgbarrett no brainer, smallest all the way!
@TheInstance I really enjoyed Quel Danas, my wife and I had a lot of fun there.
Fireworks from window cause rain.
@scottjohnson boop show is great. I like the troll reviews btw, more on Monday pls!
Well I can hear the Red Arrows...
That feeling when keeping a player feels like a new signing... #saintsfc
@ZaltzCricket The top four India batsmen have registered 0,4,0,0. Less a scorecard, more a premium rate phone line - Via BBC text commentary
"The top four India batsmen have registered 0,4,0,0. Less a scorecard, more a premium rate phone line." Via #bbccricket text commentary.
@MintyMat are you in Ogdenville or North Haverbrooke?
@BlizzHeroes the tv remote? Not sure that's gonna help!
@scottjohnson *listens for sound of dead horse being flogged*
@75wingnut phew, memory still works!
@75wingnut did we do the same college course, hnc computing, a few years back?
@damianiw a junior, JUNIOR western bacon cheese, Junior!!
Get in Geraint Thomas!!
Go Go G!!!!!
@mgbarrett @IWBeaconMag wonderful how much they paid for that advertorial. Beacon going in the bin from now on!
@CaptainBeverage cowes week?
@CaptainBeverage an article on Russia's claim "Crimea River"
Ah Tenacious D, it's been too long!
Currently feeling like I've been violated by a giant smartie shake!
A rare mob called @Bashiok eh? Better have some decent lootz!
@scottjohnson @BoopShow first one was cool, will listen to the new one tomorrow as it's bedtime here.
@SaintAndy83 fine choice! New album soon too.
@Koeman1963 @SouthamptonFC must admit have had worries this last week but a good performance is a good performance!
@ScrappySPJ I haven't read 1and 2! Still need to finish that Tad Williams Shadow Wotsit too.
@CH0L0K life in the fast lane, baby!
Watching a seagull eating chips.
@sparklypips moving boxes? Are they remote control or do they just shuffle about randomly? #badumtish #hereallweek #trytheveal
@scottjohnson is it legal?
Getting shit from Raiders fans, who I am also one, who think I mean New Orleans Saints rather than Southampton FC! Wrong sport folks!
@winbabywinwin wrong Saints dude, Southampton Football Club, Premier League etc. What you know as Soccer.
Really can't wait for the #NFL season to start so I can be disappointed with the Raiders instead of the Saints!! #saintsfc #raidernation
But now it is time to celebrate my beautiful wife @tikkabootwo's birthday. Love you Melody xxxxx
What an utter clusterfuck of a day. Carpe diem folks.
@iowct they'll never get the travel expenses approved to use the ferries!
@iowct THEY'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!!!
Evening painting Ork Warboss. Now need to plan what I need to paint for the next Apocalypse game! #wh40k
@redsaintuk harsh and not just directed at you but that's what it seems people think the club want to do. Which is daft #saintsfc
@redsaintuk no I think they're not going to bother and just get relegated because that's in the best interest of the business... #saintsfc
Tipping Point is an actual "gameshow"? Time to take off and nuke the planet from orbit, it's the only way to be sure...
@scottjohnson catching up on Diablo Show while playing WOD beta. Did I tell you I really enjoy your stuff? If not, consider yourself told :)
@ridjb adds to the flavour!
Well I've thoroughly salted my pork and slathered it in marmite. Now to sick it in a hot oven for a good roasting!!
@dankiz1 Le Tiss and Benali have come out of retirement so we can field a full team... #saintsfc
@FamblyGuy should I expect coffee delivery requests? ;)
Warlords of Dreanor beta servers finally up. I lasted about 5 client crashes and an invisible quest guy before I left it for the night! #wow
Average friendly performance, new guys looked good, followed by selling two more players. Not especially happy about things #saintsfc atm!
@Kirstie_SFC Calling Chambers to Arsenal apparently.
@mgbarrett indeed. Dan Akroyd eating smoked salmon though a Santa beard is one of my favorite movie moments.
@mgbarrett correct films, incorrect order. Trading Places &gt; Fish.
Warlords of Dreanor beta key is mine thanks to @eurogamer!! Downloading the client now.
@Teenski1 enough for a sex doll orgy?
Lucky I'm not in early tomorrow as I'm currently sweating like a 70's dj who's just heard an early morning knock on the door.
@scottjohnson I'm torn between congratulating you on this and wanting to hurt you for getting this stuck in my head again!
@redsaintuk @AddmannIW that's because you're a massive....

ly easy going guy! ;)
@Littlemisskatyb Goldie Lookin' Chain at their heartfelt best! ;)
@Littlemisskatyb 

Wanking with a bag on yer head tied to a door,
That bloke from INXS he knew the score!
Alarm set for 2 days, 5 hours and 40 mins from now. #w00t
@AbiChiverton I told you, you didn't have to watch...
Productive evening of painting geekery with @FamblyGuy. The Deffkopters I've had for years are almost done.
Massive fork lightening looking north from Newport about 15 mins ago. My naked rain dance is paying off!
@scottjohnson ahh, Happy Birthday good sir!
I fucking hate this weather.
@sdenness2000 @mgbarrett #imhereallweek #trytheveal
@mgbarrett @sdenness2000 not Penny Royal Teas? That you can sit and drink?
@imagnocean @Teenski1 @LoveCoffeeUK I'd send you one but the ice would melt before I got it to a courier!
@scottjohnson I'm just glad /played doesn't add up all the time on all my characters!
@WightHot @imagnocean @sparklypips @iwightradio pictures of them? Yeah, I'd get bored of that quick!
@Littlemisskatyb I like the World Food Program add above shoes that could feed a village! #controversial #contrast
@imagnocean @sparklypips I have one in #saintsfc colours that a customer's daughter made for me.
@RAIDERS actually it's the transition from Football to NFL but I'll let you off as I love them both :)
#blatterout sing the crowd. Sort of.
@antineil don't sugar coat it! ;)
@CaptainBeverage yeah, has that ring to it!
Goetze looks about 12, does this mean I'm old?
@CaptainBeverage he's actually the head of an evil corporation that's bent on world domination.
Higuain was a bit of a joke really, imagine if Argentina had a decent striker!
Best team won with a belter of a goal.
You beauty!!!
@chardr27 nope
This half hasn't been the best I've seen so far tbh
Seeing that statue just makes me think of all the odd places I've built it in Civ5!
@CaptainBeverage are you giving me the Mertasack-er?
@CaptainBeverage are you Schuerrle about that?
@CaptainBeverage I was going to print it out and have it Lahm-inated.
Germany are getting Klose and Klose... #obviousjoke
@scottjohnson Dune - Frank Herbert
So, is ANYONE watching the #itvsport coverage? No? Me either.
@mgbarrett which one was that? I just remember fake cgi apes and an all too real dog!
Football tweet!!!
@mgbarrett yeah but not by much, thought it was really good.
@mgbarrett I've got something to put IN you!
@Fellwolf I'm always a little dubious of sequels but it was as good as the first one.
Gallopin is galloping to le maillot jaune!
How to Train Your Dragon 2 was rather good and I didn't well up at all. No siree. Stony faced I was. Unmoved. *sniffle*
@mgbarrett well I did have pizza last night so chances of a warm seat are good!
In cinema with Lily waiting for How to Train Your Dragon 2. 

2 what I don't know, we shall find out in the fullness of time.
@chardr27 @ScrappySPJ it's an entirely pointless exercise.
@Koeman1963 @GPelle9 very happy to have him at Saints, looking forward to our new look team!
@redsaintuk we'll still be targeted for that tbh
Koeman, Tadic, Pelle, stripes! Lots of reason to be happy to be a #saintsfc fan!
@SouthamptonFC @GPelle9 Welcome to the Saints!!
"I'm thrilled I've got a ticket for the World Cup 3rd Place Playoff!!" 

Said nobody ever.
@gembarrett maybe @redsaintuk should go first?
@ScrappySPJ magic?
@rhodri that don't mean to nag... #hereallweek
Well shit.
Could it be that subconsciously neither team wants to play Germany?
It's a good job Dirk Kuyt doesn't play cricket...
@redsaintuk @sparklypips @iowct no dodgy rubber face masks? Not interested!
@Justgosailing itv player is also an option.
@Justgosailing @MintyMat you can get itv4 on freeview?
@redsaintuk @iowct well a Reliant is also plastic and disappointing ;)
@MintyMat or mute the tv and listen to the podcast.
@MintyMat turn over, now!!! Please!!!
@iowct @redsaintuk looks like a cgi reliant borefest.
Argentine players not called Messi seem to have remembered the meaning of the word "team".
(via @bingowings1…
@Justgosailing crashed twice in the rain after hurting his wrist yesterday. There were question over whether he'd be OK.
First Cav, now Froome. And I thought cyclists were supposed to be tough...
The left back should've been left back at the hotel... #badumtish
If I was Brazil, I'd have unplugged the router at halftime...
@redsaintuk they could Bang, Bang!! a few more in...
Humming the intro to Sonne by Rammstein...

Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, aus...
I'd forgotten about The Most Pointless Match in Football! #3rdplaceplayoff #TMPMIF
Pathetic attack from Germany there, useless!
Now if only Netherlands can do the same vs Argentina tomorrow!
@AddmannIW don't know about greatest, funniest maybe!
They're not booing, they're saying BooooRazil! No really...
@EasterbrookG erm.... Not looking good for that prediction!
@ScrappySPJ Lee Dixon?
@stupidwightman *doffs cap*
@ScrappySPJ being outsmarted by Rio Ferdinand #embarrassed
Germany in Kroos control...
Didn't realize Neymar played in defense...
What the fuck?
@ridjb Germany are Klose to the final now...
Bye bye Brazil
Well that was easy!
I really couldn't give a flying rats anus what skysports news or James Beattie have got to say. Not sure why any other #saintsfc fans do.
@chardr27 I see what you did there... ;)
@sdenness2000 meme of the day! ;)
@iowct ahhhhhhhh! That explains why they're touring France on bikes!!
@SouthamptonFC Excellent news!!
@mgbarrett bring your posse, bring your crew
@scottjohnson no stairway? Denied!!
@armorel_x been to Il Duomo yet? If not make sure you go up on the roof if you still can, awesome view!
@mgbarrett hehe, although a ManU fan in Manchester is a rare find!
@danielvanc no one gets paid when on strike.
@mgbarrett #sfb
@mgbarrett #f
@Battlefield none because it just crashes or stutters.
Glad Lewis got the luck today, close championship race again!
Get in Lewis!!
@MattandCat @rydethai very sad indeed, please pass on my condolences.
Sympathy for Costa Rica going out on pens but not because the Dutch keeper was "being a dick".
You shouldn't be taking a pen in the World Cup if a keeper can "put you off", poor lambs! #manup
This going to be Krul on Costa Rica...
Krul to be kind...
@richardosman I'd hate to see them Robben you of the opportunity...
Yeah, fair enough. He did tread on his foot.
@goffik too late now!! #mwahahahahahaha
@goffik I actually do like watching the TDF, I'm just being mischievous with the Footy haters ;)
Well those bicycle peddlers really peddled those bicycles today!! #bicyclepeddling
@goffik yes, yes it does!
@ScrappySPJ Land of my Fathers
Remember that time when football had to expunge over 10 years of results due to drug cheats? No, me either.
@The_T Congratulations to you and your better half!
Brazil being dodgy at the back doesn't really count for much if you panic every time you get within sight of goal...
@CaptainBeverage unless it was British Colombia #stillwrongcolombia
Columbia look scared and disjointed.
If they're not going to pronounce it properly, why not just call him Jim-Bob and be done with it!
@sdenness2000 @sparklypips expertly sidestepped!
@CaptainBeverage whatever happened to Trip Hawkins?
@CaptainBeverage I bought the very first issue, it had a lot in it about the 3DOhhhhhh
@CaptainBeverage so it can now digitally disappear up it's own arse?
@mgbarrett so about those winnings... ;)
@mgbarrett it would be tainted!!
@mgbarrett *blocks and reports*
Scheise!!
I wonder if Klose likes Nine Inch Nails...
@stupidwightman @LoveCoffeeUK well she's obviously a very clever and astute lady!
Dimitrov doesn't look like he's turned up so far!
@JayRodriguez9 looks fantastic, a proper Saints kit!
@SouthamptonFC So glad to be back in stripes! A classic looking shirt too. Come On You #Saintsfc!!
@MintyMat I saw the guy who runs the bike shop driving a car!
It was a slow day,
And the sun was beating on the soldiers by the side of the road.

(Minus the soldiers obvs)
Cheers for retweets @MintyMat , @mgbarrett and @RossFindon :)

The 20% off hot drinks between 0800 and 0900 running for the whole of July!
(via @Bigshirtlesscol)
Anyone in Newport fancy 20% off their coffee? That's a regular latte or cappuccino for £2.00! Come see me a @LoveCoffeeUK before 0900.
Now let's all patronizingly praise the plucky Yanks!
They show spiwit, you know dewwing do!
Of course a cyclists would just jump up from that and carry on...
@mgbarrett the beard.
Missus gets a @BlizzHeroes tech alpha invite before I do! #sadface
@davechiv1 maybe, half the money plus our youth setup is still better than most clubs finances.
@davechiv1 maybe, lots of options for Koeman.
I'm sure the citizens of Algeria, Nigeria etc etc are glad that various pundits have given them permission to be proud of their countries.
I'm as bored of the bitter and downright nasty reaction to Lallanas transfer from #saintsfc fans as I was of the Plastic Scouser speculation
@rhodri I didn't until then you fool!! ;)
@sdenness2000 @LoveCoffeeUK nee probs
Nigeria and Algeria have been very good but against a couple of very well organized and very fit teams, they just didn't have enough.
@b33rdy @sparklypips @iowct trust you to get lippy!!
@CaptainBeverage you've done it now!
@sparklypips @b33rdy you could've said at half time ffs!!!
Was about to tweet "&lt;insert player name&gt; is playing a bit shit" but that's a guarantee they'll score. I have that kind of power you know.
@scottjohnson I haven't told anyone I like The Offspring, I've got no self esteem...
So, Algeria vs Germany. I mean we can hope for the biggest World Cup upset of all time but it's not going to happen.
20% off all hot drinks!!!!
@AbiChiverton who said it was for work?
@SouthamptonFC with red and white stripes, yes?
Feel for Nigeria but France were the much better team.
@redsaintuk @KellyMauger I'm guessing Graziano Pelle?
Impressed with Nigeria's start here although France look like scoring every time they attack. Good stuff so far.
@AbiChiverton yup, makes it much easier to fit the broom up my arse! ;)
Not that I'm massively paranoid and clutching at straws...

What you lookin' at?????
I'm slowly realizing the massive conspiracy between Adidas, ManU and Liverpool in making #saintsfc an all red kit to ease transition...
(via @willrolls)
@daraobriain autocorrect know ALL your secrets...
@Teenski1 hasn't @davechiv1 got Ginger Nuts?
@CaptainBeverage Bravo!
Farewell Greece, don't let the door hit you on the way out!
@WeBeHarebrained @steam_games just picked up Shadowrun Returns, so far so good! Used to play p&amp;p version in my youth.
@CaptainBeverage he bit someone, he didn't murder them and then voilate their corpse.
@sdenness2000 @davechiv1 @Teenski1 matron!!
@Teenski1 @davechiv1 #ooer #fnarr #winkwink

@dannykellywords: I don't think we're watching winne…
@iowct @mgbarrett Eric B and Fukim?
Costa Rica all the way.
This goes to show that twatting around by the corner flag while only leading by one goal isn't a good idea.
He suckered them into that one!
Great defending until then...
Boom!!
Mexicans doing a Mexican Wave while watching Mexico.
@CaptainBeverage I can't afford to play both so 40k is the thing atm.
Time for a break in Ork related gubbinz for some footy bally.
@CaptainBeverage more buffs than nerfs overall, tons more options and actually useful psyker powers. Going to have to re-jig my lists.
@redsaintuk you had fun?!? What the hell do you think you're playing at?
@CaptainBeverage I've spent most of the day trying to decipher the new Ork codex, I now have a headache.
@richardosman I thought @XanderArmstrong presented Pointless? #burn ;)
@Koeman1963 safe journey, looking forward to the new season!
@davechiv1 yeah, they'll just play Rock Me Amadeus over and over...
@sparklypips @b33rdy ahh, the free bar party!! You mean you were there too? ;)
@Battlefield tried #bf4 with my new gtx770. Still stuttering, even on low settings. Every other game is fine. Had enough now.
@b33rdy @redsaintuk M$ been trying for donkey's years to make mobile windows, still can't make it work!
@b33rdy @redsaintuk I think they smell of poo #techanalysis
Free, confidant, open football. Colombia are playing some sweet sweet stuff tonight!

Also, Andy Townsend is a prize twat.
@MintyMat that's better than I usually get!!
@custard1980 \m/
@scottjohnson generally? My mum.
@gredgie @redsaintuk I am awaiting my my Michelin Star for my cheese toastie!
@FamblyGuy @ScrappySPJ @Grievy luckily for you I'm worse!
@armorel_x discs? What are these disc things? Is that what comes over t'internet?
@ridjb I think Belgium just did!
And then Algeria score! I'm claiming credit for that goal!
So if Russia go through, Capello can watch another team of his get their arses kicked by Germany in the second round...
Half time sub Denisov, shouldn't that be Denison?
@scottjohnson don't forget the expansions are cheap too atm and all very good too.
Ouch!
@mgbarrett @ScrappySPJ wrong day, I had Sleeper, Radiohead and (the fucking awful) Cranberries.
@ScrappySPJ "This is a song about how you think you're in love but you're really just drunk" - Michael Stipe, Milton Keynes Bowl, 1995.
@scottjohnson Then I doff my cap to you, sir! Just noticed Endless Space on there, managed about 8 hours before going back to Civ 5, again.
@scottjohnson but how many have you actually played? Hmm? (I can also list a few)
@mgbarrett no probs, give me a minute...
Betty Swollocks. That is all.
@b33rdy @DannyT it's to orangy for crows...
@stupidwightman but if you do, don't get in a flap... #hereallweek #sorry
@saints247 something we can really get our teeth into...
I hope Costa Rica take Greece apart.
Oh ffs, what a load of crap! Anti-football about to win...
I really hope Ivory Coast tear Greece a new one!
@Littlemisskatyb @jamierubicin that happened in the NFL with Bill Cowher, at the time head coach of the Steelers, and Kordell Stewart!
@mgbarrett @bbc5live IT'S A DISGRACE!!
Yes Clive, I feel so sorry for those England fans who can afford a holiday in Brazil with the occasional football match... #twat #itvsport
@redsaintuk Australia played better and, so far, scored more goals.
30 mins left of England's world cup. Won't be sorry to see them go as every other team(except Greece and Honduras maybe) has been better.
@CaptainBeverage it's my like ambition to unite the two countries, I'm going to make a Korea out of it...
@FamblyGuy a not unjustified feeling.
@BlizzardCSEU_EN goodbye and good riddance auction house!
Did your weekend finish yesterday? Sucks to be you!!!

(Please feel free to point and laugh while I'm at work on Saturday)
@Littlemisskatyb @trappingawdess how does she know you have a tacky bra?!?
Do the USA have the stomach to win this? Clint Dempsey says yes!
That was a nice goal. 

(My Phil Neville impression)
@CaptainBeverage ha, you've never played with me then! I can never remember half the special rules.
@CaptainBeverage plenty of books there, not compulsory to have one. We had to keep checking stuff regardless.
@CaptainBeverage a shock for everyone but me. The Imperial forces crushed the heretics and deamons today too. Double awesome ;)
@CaptainBeverage I almost made the same mistake, turns out I'm awesome.
@AdamSchefter come on Adam, the rest of the world call it football! Still it's better than soccer I suppose ;)
South Korea vs Algeria, that'll be dull then. Or maybe not!
The Deathwing has deployed!! 
@sparklypips how very dare you suggest I would be so uncouth as to constantly wear tatty blackish jeans! Oh, bugger.
Not undeserved but methinks Bosnia will hit back. Verily.
@sparklypips verily it was thus
"He did well to make it hard for Djeko... " #ooer #fnarr #winkwink
@ScrappySPJ you're just too edgy, man!
@gredgie when David Seaman was still playing, oh the hilarity!!
"He's going to have to bring a big name off..." #ooer #fnarr #winkwink
@KermodeMovie oh dear, welcome to the cardboard crack!
And that's a Costly goal for Honduras!!
@redsaintuk nah, I'd take itv over them and I just mute the "analysis"
@redsaintuk don't watch SkySports?
Still not had any "that was a costly goal" or "that was a costly mistake" while Honduras have been playing.
@ridjb awesome signing!
Ah, a defence like Swiss cheese...
je n'ai pas dit mon ascendance française?
@mgbarrett @MintyMat there ARE those pesky Italians though.
Can Thierry Henry be England manager?
Well at least we don't have to wait until Tuesday now.
Whoever is playing these two teams is relying waaaay too much on the Y/triangle button!
It doesn't matter what Robbie Savage says, I instinctively want to disagree with him!
@saints247 going on holiday to Brazil while watching some football? Yeah my heart bleeds for them...
Let's go for the hat-trick against Costa Rica!!!
Well well well, that's interesting!
Yay, 20 mins for Lallana.
Well this is a massive crock of shit.
Time for a change, Roy.
@Teenski1 we've had a fox in our garden and he just stood there and barked at it, not very brave!
@sparklypips this is true, every cloud...
@Teenski1 he's good at barking and them wagging his tail a lot but not much else!
@sparklypips I've muted the TV but he's still pissing me off!!
Got the dog led on me. Was going to move him in case we score, don't think I'll bother... 
Piss poor tackling from midfield back.
Football and fermented apples!
@toymaker1980 @redsaintuk For the Emperor!!
@gembarrett at least it's cheap if you hate it! Just play through the intro to the first quest hub before you decide.
@gembarrett Witcher 2 currently £2.99 on steam.
@sparklypips it's a burning issue... #badumtish #hereallweek #isthisthingon
Adios
Time for at least half this Spanish team to retire!
@gredgie plenty more where that came from!
It's usually hot in Spain but now they're feeling Chile....
@redsaintuk well, in my face obviously!
Oops!!
Cahill and RVP both lucky to still be on the field. Brilliant goals, terrible tackles.
@BeachyBooks @ScrappySPJ OR an implied line between two jumpers for goalpost. Isn't it? Wasn't it? Enduring image!
Told ya, dodgy keeper!!
@O2 Newport and Cowes have no data at all, service status says the mast is being looked at but it's said that since Thursday last week.
@FamblyGuy the psychic phase, objective cards and new challenge rules were interesting.
A goal seems inevitable if these two goalies keep being tested. Neither look confidant!
@FamblyGuy been playing 750 point games to practice 7th for Sunday Apocalypse, didn't miss anything then! 
The last time @O2 fiddled with the masts in Newport for the Isle of wight festival, we didn't get data back for 6 months.
@CaptainBeverage OR he can tell them to get stuffed :)
@ScrappySPJ that was a concern too tbh, it had a whiff of rats from a sinking ship for a while.
Chuffed with Koeman announcement, glad it's sorted and we can get on with prep for next season #saintsfc
Honduras need to watch Bosnia for a lesson on how to be rugged without being thuggish.
@7puzzle I think it's the lines holding the net out at the back that's catching the ball and fooling us!
Johnathan Pearce must be easily confused...
Not a goal from Benzema, own goal from the keeper, simples.
Thierry Henry and Clarence Seedorf, eloquent and intelligent. Why in hell would you add Robbie Savage?!?
@FamblyGuy that's what the white spray is!
Definite pen, definite red.
@FamblyGuy I'm just going to think they've all been taken by the Samba Football bug!
@FamblyGuy it's awesome!
@gembarrett it's pretty cheap on steam these days.
@gembarrett never played the witcher but witcher 2 is very good, once you get to the first quest hub anyway.
20 seconds left in injury time to get the winner!! Nearly the first draw of the World Cup!
If only Shaqiri was a sub, puntastic opportunities if he came on!
@scottjohnson I wish I'd watched that rather than England losing to Italy :( Is the soundtrack as good as the first one BTW? Loved that.
Spain lost their first match before going on to win the last World Cup. So basically Uruguay aren't out of this yet! #seewhatididthere
Uruguay or bust then.
Played right into Italy's hands here.
It's going to fizzle out now.
"What do England need to do to recover this?" Um, score a goal?
Arse
@goffik another month or so?
England physio injured? #irony
GET THE FUCK IN!!!!
@chardr27 sorry, goal.
@chardr27 it's like anything, if you watch enough you know GET IN!!!!!!!!
Arse.
@chardr27 numbers by position hasn't been a thing for about 20 years.
@goffik a ship? In space? Don't be daft man!
That even had the TV fooled!!
Italian anthem wins the opening exchanges by virtue of not being a dirge!
WTF!! Costa Rica!!!
@goffik it's "years of hurt" actually!!!!!!! 111111oneone ;)
@scottjohnson but I'm too busy watching Uruguay vs Costa Rica to tweet #winhodor! Oh wait, damn!
Think I'll wait for the official team announcement before I jump on the self-righteous bandwagon.
That was probably a penalty, more so than the other two at any rate.
I'd Columbia's style and attacking play any day over Greece's anti-football.
Wot no goal line tech demo?!?
@redsaintuk needs must etc
@redsaintuk sell a small quantity of your #mtg cards?

Holland: Pass Pass Cross Goal
Like I was saying...
Time for Cassillas to be retired methinks.
Get in!
@dankiz1 they still talk bollocks but they're so much less annoying while doing it!
Goal of the tournament so far!
Don't reckon there was contact.
Does no one want to shoot?!?
Weak shot really.
@iowct route 66? 66, nearly the number of the beast?
Both teams wearing away shirts. Insightful observations all the way!
@thediabloshow depends on the act the bounties are in and also how monster dense the rift is. Could be either really.
Hulk Smash!! (The ball into row z)
@aprilross977 I feel for you! ;)
Now THAT'S going to liven things up!
@daraobriain players ftw!
@scottjohnson E3?!? The World Cup is on!!! My Diablo playing time is about to take a major hit.
@MattandCat so far, so good!
@MattandCat *gives massive thumbs up with cheesy grin* :)
I'm called bullshit on @O2's "heavy usage" excuse for no data ATM considering it's been completely dead since yesterday morning! #iow
@goffik starting tomorrow, from 1700-0100, tweet that occasionally and you're sure to get lucky. I'll copy you in all my world cup tweets ;)
@MattandCat @damianiw #fnarr #winkwink #saynomore #nudgenudge #ooer #missus
All this traffic, eh? I mean it's like totally unexpected and doesn't happen EVERY YEAR. Wait a minute....
#Smoothies #Fresh 
@scottjohnson indeed but makes for excellent opportunities for nostalgia!
@scottjohnson it's a good comic, even though a bunch of us were calling them that at the Greenbelt Festival in 1987. Yes I am also old.
@gembarrett I do expect it to be better than DA 2 though!
Another hashtag to mute #Britishvalues
Started playing Heart of the Swarm about a year after I originally bought it #sc2
I see the TV police are about with guns to heads FORCING people to watch football...
@richardosman that's what dvr's are for!
@mgbarrett is it the one with Bea with the big boobs?
@iowct I bought that album on vinyl when I was about 12, still listen to it now.
@iowct Animal!
@goffik 
Vindaloo, vindaloo, 
Vindaloo, vindaloo la la!!
@sparklypips psychological thrillers aren't my strong suit. Now if you'd said overblown sci-fi/fantasy epics...
Big congratulations to @emmit93 for passing her anatomy exam and her first year nursing degree!!
@CaptainBeverage I heard Sir Kill-a-Lot went off the rails and died from an accidental oil overdose. Very sad really.
@scottjohnson the problem with GoT spoilers is that it's on pay tv and if one doesn't have pay tv one has to wait a year for the DVDs.
@gordonsimpson I'll just upload it to my PDA...
@thediabloshow this is true but I need a break so original Mass Effect it is! I'd forgotten how annoying the Mako is though.
@mgbarrett Kick Off 2 &gt; Sensible Soccer any day of the week. Used to play that with @redsaintuk and @Felna #oldschool or maybe just #old
Mind you, I'd forgive it all if he's appointed and picks up where Poch left off #saintsfc
All this talk of Koeman reminds me of this! #saintsfc 

Nederland - Engeland 2-0, WK kwalificatie 1994: 
@chriscornell 
here is a pig,
The rooster says....
@iowct I'll drink yours, I'll step up and take the #apples!!
@LoveCoffeeUK iced coffee and tea when hot.
@smingle that's always a danger with tiny violins tbh
@redsaintuk @FamblyGuy @chardr27 (((((((((hugz))))))))))
@chardr27 @redsaintuk #sorry #mybad
@chardr27 @redsaintuk passive aggressive non-specific tweeting.
Eighth day of work in a row, afternoon off followed by day off. Feeling a tad tired. Please feel free to play your tiny violins now.
Also, NEW ORKS!!!!!
With the clusterfuck that is #saintsfc's off season so far, I'm quite looking forward to the #Raiders have a good(winning) season!
Nick Griffin is officially #pointless!!
Should I start playing Mass Effect from the start again? #burningquestions
@Littlemisskatyb funny that it's mostly folks with fuck tons of money who say that. Give it away and become a monk if it's that overrated!
@Tracypolexoxo I use one as a water pot for when painting my soldiers.
@ridjb no fair, I brought lube and everything!!
@CaptainBeverage Yay for man action!!!
Yay!!!
Yay for that man hitting that other man!!
Yay for ridiculing sports we don't like by referring to them in simplistic terms!!!
Yay for fisting!!!
@FamblyGuy will do
Well that was a clusterfuck of a day!!
Thought I'd join in blocking the Gym Motivation account, I'll #feeltheburn when I eat a curry or have an infection thanks!
@SouthamptonFC um #2lions and possibly #0lions by the time it starts?
@AquilaRift @Kalyr pretty much spot on except I'd take Hemispheres over 2112.
@FamblyGuy @redsaintuk some big tree models would make a nice birthday pres-Ent!! #badumtish
@FamblyGuy @redsaintuk and Wood Elves apparently!
@FamblyGuy it would be funny if I wasn't waaaaaay to lazy to bother ;) Also waaaaaay wanted to autocorrect to Waaaaaaagh!!
@FamblyGuy I'm going to secretly change your phone alert to the call nurse beep and text you at 2 hour intervals through the night...
@armorel_x the trick to baking people is the right amount of seasoning... ;)
@CaptainBeverage it's called Titanfall apparently.
Hey ho, onwards and upwards! Good luck dealing with Daniel Levy though, Poch me old china! #saintsfc
@AbiChiverton @Teenski1 @LoveCoffeeUK I WAS ON A BREAK!!!! #friends #veryoldreference

 @redsaintuk
How many times has Toto Wolfe been asked to say,'"Run, get to da choppa!!"
@damianiw as far as I know Fifa 14 is still Fifa 12 with updated teams so no point as yet.
@Littlemisskatyb future alien archaeologists will say,"And this is why the Human Race destroyed itself... "
@ScrappySPJ funny because my timeline seems to have been bombarded by cyclists &gt; footballers pictures that seem to forget about doping.
@ScrappySPJ just starting dance, feast had some good stuff in between the "now who the hell were they" bits.
Game of Thrones Book 5 about to start. Who needs this tv bollocks, eh?
Fuck me Lee Dixon is dull... #itvsport
@thediabloshow excellent! Should arrive at about the end of the football.
So a four shot caramel caffe freezer is a thing now, very nice I'm told too @LoveCoffeeUK
@FamblyGuy it's just moan moan fucking moan with you!
@FamblyGuy just trying to keep ahead of tv spoilers. On book four, all a bit ponderous atm.
@FamblyGuy reading Game of Thrones, there's a lot of head rolling. Need next HH books, too much seed spillage in GoT, not enough geneseed!
@FamblyGuy not like you need a good night's sleep before physio or anything!
It would appear that voting is like going to the gym, it doesn't count unless you tweet about it...
@scottjohnson by the way, which one's pink?
@redsaintuk @goffik @HeritageAction so you've got no beef with them then? I was going to draw a Venn-ison diagram...
@goffik did you want me to ham it up a bit, you poor Lamb!
@FamblyGuy @redsaintuk @Tracypolexoxo @specialf don't worry, we'll find you! #mwhahahahahahaha
@Tracypolexoxo @redsaintuk @FamblyGuy @specialf lots of subliminal wishes for dwarf porn, what does this tell us I wonder...
@adembskibowden gratz on 5 years, need to catch up on HH reading but First Heretic is one of my favorites.
Storm's a comin'
@thediabloshow clickables and kickables, totally with you on that one! Also, no white item for crafting is the bit of the patch for me.
@thediabloshow and I happen to be rifting, would be rude not to listen!
How long before Titwank mentions penalties and them being "exciting for the neutral"?
@davechiv1 I can't believe he's still ITV's go to guy!!
The plus side of missing the first half is I only have one half of Clive Titwank to listen to #itvfootball

 @emmit93
@mgbarrett I saw Ned's supporting The Wonderstuff around '89 I think, Circlesquare had just come out. Both were awesome.
@scottjohnson golf games on handhelds are awesome, from the original gameboy Mario gold to the Vita version of Everybody's Golf.
@thediabloshow yeah, it's a flat one you might wear for a night at the dog track! #badumtish
Charging for access to content that was free elsewhere and forcing the purchase of unwanted peripherals a bad idea? Well I never!! #xboxone
@SouthamptonFC as long as it has stripes, I'm sure we'll all be happy!
@scottjohnson that was nicked from an old Star Trek Original Series spoof btw.
@scottjohnson next is "I am thousands of years old but I do not understand the human emotion of love, kiss me Nephalim... "
@sdenness2000 surely they'd only serve mashed potato!!

@redsaintuk and working in a beetroot factory!
Absolutely chuffed for all three #saintsfc players going to Brazil but especially for Rickie, what a journey it's been!
Don't like Footy in your timeline? Like some cheese with your whine?
On one hand I'm hoping #saintsfc won't sell anyone, on the other I'm pretty pleased with the #Raiders draft.
@specialf have you tried Good Old Games? 
Rickyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!! #saintsfc
Martin SkrteLOL!!
I bet Toto Wolfe does a mean Arnie! #f1

#ItsNotGoneWell 
@scottjohnson tried Sigur Ros?
@redsaintuk WHO THE HELL ARE THEY TO ARBITRARILY ASSIGN A GENDER TO THOSE APPLES!!! IT'S AN OUTRAGE!!!!!!!!!!
I'm going to bed, twitter can get nauseating "right on" at times.
@thediabloshow I will wait, well actually sleep, with baited breath! It's 0030 here and I just got TWO ledgendaries from Kadala! TWO!!
@scottjohnson playing Diablo? Indeed you are correct, sir!
@scottjohnson @thediabloshow but I'm playing Diablo now dammit! ;)
@damianiw I might have to investigate!
@damianiw ooooh, the OTHER good Jaguar game?
@Teenski1 I dunno, my sing a long with Lily to Welcome to the Black Parade was pretty awesome!
@scottjohnson @instanceshow @williedills @The_T I've not listened to a bad Instance yet. You guys are always on top form!

@thediabloshow Ring of Grandure dropped from an Act I cache last night, my first upgrade in about 2 weeks!
Well done Mark Sent but can't help thinking Ronnie threw it away #bbcsnooker
@thediabloshow or "I've been killed one too many times by this Arcane Frozen Molten Jailer pack!"
John Virgo is a miserable old fart and should be consigned to the scrap heap #bbcsnooker
@redsaintuk operation yewtree on alert!
@ScrappySPJ oh how I wish they would!!
Cutting edge commentary from Willie Thorn, O'Sullivan's hair is different... #bbcsnooker
@scottjohnson @nerdtacularshow one day, when I've won the lottery, I'll be over to the US for this and Blizzcon. And some NFL.
Well I really have no idea now what's going to happen tomorrow now, neither player is playing very well #bbcsnooker

#Breakfast #NICE! 
@redsaintuk keep up, pfft!
@redsaintuk you don't come back from four frames down, in the final, against O'Sullivan.
@damianiw yeah but I've been collecting for a while so have gradually built up my forces.
This is Ronnie's unless he decides not to turn up tomorrow, literally or metaphorically #bbcsnooker
@damianiw I'm still useless, doesn't stop me painting hundreds of Orks though!
@ScrappySPJ all his opponents seem intent on giving him easy openings and not taking their own.
@ScrappySPJ you mean you don't pass them to the left hand side?
@scottjohnson that'll be the old Hellfire ring bosses you be talking about! I have one from vanilla but not tried yet in RoS. Great show btw
@redsaintuk free game, get over it?
@MintyMat @CH0L0K into the left corner pocket...
@ScrappySPJ well I'm pretty sure either of these two won't crumble like Murphy and Hawkins did, hopefully!
@ScrappySPJ I hope so, I hope whoever wins is up for giving Ronnie a game!

Well that was disappointing and over rather quickly! I know the feeling says @tikkabootwo... #worldsnooker
And that's a bad miss... #worldsnooker
@scottjohnson awesomeness :)
@scottjohnson is there an Instance this week?
@CaptainBeverage depends what limitations you're imposing...

#FunnyNameFriday 
@CaptainBeverage Google decklists?

@Diablo @thediabloshow first episode was great, now in the next one can I get some clues on how to get a good legendary?
@ridjb it's a slim hope, granted...

1. Horoscopes 

2. How many people unfollowed you

3. Every song you are listening to

4. …
@saints247 I have fond memories of Seaman coming out of the box and Seaman was all over that..
@thediabloshow I stayed a while, I listened. Good stuff overall, guest guy knew his onions!
Half the duel carriage way coned off on a Saturday lunchtime and not a person in sight doing anything #golfclap #islandroads
@CaptainBeverage congratulations &gt; gratz &gt; gz!! You just lost 10 points of geek cred... #n00b
@Diablo four ledgendaries tonight, all rubbish. It's beginning to feel like the same grind as before but with brown instead of yellow loots.
@imagnocean @LoveCoffeeUK bring Melody? I get told off for being Melody, she always wants her clothes back! @tikkabootwo
@LoveCoffeeUK @imagnocean I'll bring it myself and claim the expenses!
@CaptainBeverage gz!
@scottjohnson looking forward to it, stuck on T2 with my Crusader and need more (good) legendarys!
@Clert blizzard servers were terrible yesterday too, maybe more ddos shenanigans?
@AussieGrit is that a Wiemaraner? Mad dogs!
@Clert @eurogamer make your character more than a list of stats and have fun!
@redsaintuk @virtualranger caterpillars?
@CaptainBeverage it's the same principles really, slightly simplified.
@CaptainBeverage Did you ever play magic the gathering?
@WatcherDev I started playing again because of lfr, I missed all of WotLK and Cataclysm raids due to life &gt; raiding guilds. Lfr is awesome.
I would like to formally rule myself out of the running for the Manchester United job.
@davechiv1 @AdamSchefter if he doesn't overthrow them or get sacked trying to run every down regardless.

@CaptainBeverage Hahahahahahahahaha!!!
@CaptainBeverage Newport? Fun? Hahahahahahahahaha!!!
@ScrappySPJ @mgbarrett 69 dudes!!!
Tonight I didn't paint Orks, I started making a Deathwing Land Raider #wh40k
@gredgie @ScrappySPJ from what I saw, I'd say not...
@ScrappySPJ a guy I don't know
@MintyMat I like it when the players say "golf" in front of course, shot, club etc because I really need the context!
Bringing your girlfriend to an all day apocalypse game? Maybe not a great move...
Dakka Dakka!! 
What a beautiful day to be inside playing a massive Apocalypse game!! #wh40k #waaaaagh

@Diablo just completed the campaign on my Crusader, killed Maltheal with 2 bars left to 70! Much better system and love the Crusader, gj.
Thanks to @bbc5live for updating me on the Twitter Celebrity Competitive Grieving Stakes, useful info that.
@ElderScrolls @TESOnline looking forward to seeing Dreanor before the effects of the Dark Portal! No wait, oops!

@MarkDuaneMorton :( but you remember him
@ridjb ha, now your team is losing! Sorry, that's all I got.
@Littlemisskatyb realistic expectations.
@aprilross977 some but not enough!
We are Southampton and we never win on Sky #saintsfc
All confidence gone #saintsfc
Well that was a bit silly #saintsfc
The comedy defending reminds me far too much of the first match! #saintsfc
@mgbarrett lol at ours for that last one :(
Oh ffs!! @saintsfc
Get in J-Rod!! #saintsfc
@SouthamptonFC all the possession and chances and lose 2-0 to two crap goals. We're on telly, always happens when we're on telly.
Also anyone in Cowes watching the match in town? #saintsfc
So on tv against a "big" club, I confidently predict all the possession, tons of chances and lose 2-0 #saintsfc
@virtualranger as it should be!

@ScrappySPJ @redsaintuk can I watch? Are you selling tickets?
@davechiv1 @ScrappySPJ just accept the inevitable apre-superbowl slump, no playoffs for you next season!
@FamblyGuy ghosts was struggling before titanfall, now it's been exorcised completely I'd say.
@ScrappySPJ @davechiv1 sixth round pick, seems fair. Culpepper, Palmer, big signings bigger flops.
@ScrappySPJ @davechiv1 of course the #raiders have a history of turning cast offs into winners, Stabler, Plunkett, Gannon etc
@ScrappySPJ don't you start, I had this from @davechiv1 earlier! He's solid if nothing else and we've got some good backs.
@scottjohnson the term you're looking for for "what are the current best decks" is the metagame.

@Littlemisskatyb nope! Well I say that, give me a few million and I'll see how I feel.
@joshmosq so happy about this, I've always tried to play without the AH but was quite frustrating at times!
@BeachyBooks it's not particularly original or deep but I really enjoyed the books and love the films.
@emmit93 breakfast?!? Lazy cow!
You know all the outraged tweets about tabloid pictures of someone in a moment of grief? They all contain said pictures... #irony #dicks
@AbiChiverton @FamblyGuy well I could cause an injury with something that size, concussion probably.
@AbiChiverton @FamblyGuy was just thinking of what kind of injury I could get... ;)

@Fellwolf indeed
@Fellwolf unfortunate for the game as a contest but definite red card.
Wales win 51-3, #saintsfc 3-0 up!!
@redsaintuk more than England managed against them...
50 up for Wales!! OK so it is only against Scotland...
@ScrappySPJ now that sounds like fun!!
@scottjohnson @StephenKing only ever got as far as the third book.
#saintsfc winning, Wales winning, so far so good.
@b33rdy @redsaintuk is it the one opposite subway and pizza express?
@scottjohnson really wanted to like Dota 2, hoping Heroes will be good! I've liked everything I've heard apart from buying the characters.
@Surprisedzoe nah, not in the same league as the other two.
