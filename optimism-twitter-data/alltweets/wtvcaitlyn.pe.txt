When your mom knows about One Direction Twitter fights before you
My mom picked me up from school and was like did you see Zayn &amp; Louis &amp; NB on Twitter and I was like that was a month ago..little did I know
Can Harry come online and say something I mean he just learned how to say walkie talkie in French so he should be very useful
I'm so mad I missed all of this on Twitter
This is probably all staged crap that they just make money for tweeting but still it's highly unnecessary &amp; Zayns ruining his image
What the fuck  
my teacher just played Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC for me as we all left our class and i literally lost it
@pressplayontour @JetBlue take notes

I would pick calling and facetiming over texting any day
I hate my username with a burning passion
My mom is yelling at me from under the deck outside my room about Justin Timberlakes tequila drink &amp; commercial ok

@VANSARGUS come back I love u thank u!!
Wesley is such a bitch on Twitter these days all he tweets about his is friends

@steffanargus I'll make this easy for you I'm a hater
@steffanargus *flies to LA and slits your throat*
good thing the next 5 weekends in a row ill be with sarah
Fun fact in 3rd grade my mom made me print out lyrics to songs I wanted to buy on iTunes &amp; I cried when she said no to Right Round
@DrewsTylenol holy shit this is awesome
I'm going to lose my mind next week at the Kiss108 concert when Flo Rida sings Right Round I've waited to see that live since 3rd grade
I'm so sarcastic I hope I've never actually offended anyone before
@hsbooze there u go 
my art class got to go outside in the courtyard for class fuck yaaaa 
going on tumblr and listening to music for an hour during school just put me in the best mood ever
why is jack gilinsky so perfect
I CANT GO ON TUMBLR DURING SCHOOL WITHOUT SEEING SOME RIDICULOUSLY FUNNY VIDEO AND THEN I LOOK INSANE LAUGHING TO MYSELF AT MY COMPUTER SOS
i love really small and random bands that no one knows about but have better music than a majority of more popular bands
@lrhestop whys that
will someone please pick me up from school and either take me to get pizza or to the airport so i can get on a random flight to somewhere
i regret going to a public school for high school more than anything
@hsbooze I &lt;3 MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC SCHOOLS

wish I had never met you
I wasted too much time today
@mandytbh OKAY THAT DEFINITELY SOUNDS LIKE ME BUT I HAD THAT USERNAME BEFORE THEM XaznxnH
NO OH MY GOD BUT THEY TOOK MY USERNAME  
At other times my username in 2011 was iCaitlyn, BiebersAutumn, BieberCamp, GotBieb, BieberHorse, Biebkini, and more
@midnightmendes thank god someone can relate
One time in 2011 I tried to be a relatable quotes account and my username was OhTeenGirl but clearly that career did not work out for me
I wish i knew who saw my tweets on a regular basis
Since it's too hot to wear sweatshirts in school this means I can't take my bra off in the middle of class and put it in my backpack fuck
I don't have anything to wear to school tomorrow I'm just going to wear a napkin.
ugh
what part of its over and I'm moving on are you struggling to understand
here's more icons of mine that I'll probably get sick of in 30 seconds or less 
jackie and wilson // hozier
@silveradidas LMAO I don't even think that's a real username let's check @wthcviyling
@KyaMcIntyre I had a feeling that was you uGH SORRY I ALWAYS SKIP
good thing I just saw 85959 people I knew on Omegle
@nolansnuts @joeykidney jamie I hope you understand I was in the middle of unlocking my phone to tag you in this tweet
follow my VSCO if you know what's good for you 
Someone sell me floor seats to Taylor Swift at Gillette Stadium for either July 24 or the 25th
I can't wait to see Taylor Swift again this summer
can't wait to be w/ the squad again next month @itsallienelson @Alex_Reininga and our special guest @steffanargus
I'm overwhelmed 
All my brother has done lately is walk around showing off and taking care of a cactus he got yesterday 
@DrewsTylenol YOUR DATE HAR A MAN BUN HES A KEEPER
Wow awesome all my iPhoto pictures duplicated so I get to go through 24k pictures and delete half of them wow fantastic!
@bamblouzle @grlaImighty definitely one of my more flattering picture angles
I can't look at my WWA pictures it's too heartbreaking
Scrolling through my iPhoto and I see this and I actually jumped because it scared me oh my god 
On this weeks episode of Hoarders 
@gilletteniall don't worry I actually laughed
@gilletteniall dear god
20 days until I can have a complete Twitter photoset of times I've seen @edsheeran live 
a week ago was the last night of the cruise that makes me so sad that was such a good night
@sadsongIrh FUCK UGH GOALS
the best date in the entire world would definitely be going to an Ed Sheeran concert together
@calummaterial the white glove that comes with the game makes the blood sweat and tears all worth it
I just demolished all of my friends in the Michael Jackson Dance game for Wii

JACK MCCOLL TRYNA MAKE A COMEBACK OH MY GOD 
Clearly @Therealbeadles1 wants me dead 
Why isn't this me 
It doesn't matter where I go on vacation someone famous is there the week before/right after
Figures Bea Miller and Jacob Whitesides are at Universal 5 days after I was there
all I've done today is eat cake, online shop, watch live concert videos, and sleep
spending every day until May 23 in my bed crying over Ed until it's time to get up and see him and cry some more 
I don't even remember how to shop for summer concerts and what to wear just because I haven't been to one in forever
maybe I'll tell my mom about PPNJ soon

NEVER GO ON A CRUISE EVEN MY GUY COUSINS ARE BREAKING DOWN IN TEARS OVER THIS I DONT LIKE IT WHEN FUN THINGS END
I miss my cruise sosososo much 
One Direction has stayed at this hotel that's all that matters 
How do I adjust to buying food like a normal person does I just had free food whenever I wanted for an entire week
My family is such a riot the 19 of us all just took over a cruise ship for a week and now we're all at Universal
ya girl is at Universal now 
PCD = post cruise depression
once again so close to @JessicaRiker16 but still can't see her
The guy in the shuttle that's taking us to our hotel is concerned because I'm bawling my eyes out over leaving everyone
I'm so bad with goodbyes it's not even funny
I don't like sitting outside of the boat watching the people I've been with for an entire week leave this blows
I'm off the boat )):
can I relive the last hour
holy shit that was the craziest night ever, what a way to end a cruise
I WAS DANCING TO FIFTH HARMONY IN THE ELEVATOR FOR 10 MINUTES AND THE ELEVATOR STOPPED IN BETWEEN 2 FLOORS AND I PRESSED THE 911 BUTTON
WE JUST FUCKING BROKE THE ELEVATOR
Why do I always end up with sun poisoning
This sucks don't go on cruises if you have issues with separating from people
I can't even wrap it around my head that I have to leave all these people on this cruise in 16 hours
I hate how in 24 hours I won't be on this cruise anymore ugh
@jordan_what I miss you so so so much as soon as I come home we can try to plan something for next weekend or sometime soon I promise
today is officially the last day of the cruise good thing I'll be crying all day
what happens at 2 am in the random shafts of the cruise ship hiding from deck patrol stays at 2 am in the random shafts of the cruise ship
daaaaaaamnnnn
I walked into my room and screamed because I was face to face with this thing 
Happy 1 year since I live tweeted me chasing that kid around in Busch Gardens to get his Instagram 
@itsallienelson LITERALLY I AM
There's this 20 year old that is always walking around the boat with a guitar and everyone calls him Guitar Dude and is scared of him
Prom is tonight on the boat everyone pray for me and Hot Kid From The Cruise Named Joe to win prom king and queen
hate how you act like everything we had never happened
Hot Kid From The Cruise Named Joe is 12 o'clock from me in the blue shirt this is a code red 
Some cruise ship worker just came over to us and serenaded us with So Sick by Ne Yo and it was pretty good actually

ARE YOU KIDDING. UNNECESSARY. 
pulling away from the last island &lt;\3 
The boat is playing the WMYB music video just shoot me now 
It's so necessary for the cruise ship to play to Sail as we take off from St. Maarten
@steffanargus ok stop don't favorite that I don't know why that just happened uGh
@steffanargus
I'm sitting on my balcony of my room watching baby turtles swim around the boat
@futuresheart @anchordwn the random red splotch on my stomach takes true talent don't try this at home
@anchordwn @futuresheart getting my tan on
@steffanargus I leave for 17 hours and I come back and you're following jamie are you insisting that I should just jump off this boat or
@futuresheart how is the love of my life
Hi

Bahamas <SPARKLING HEART> 
Why is my uncle like this

I'm going to try to connect to wifi tomorrow if you need me DM/text me and I'll get to you ASAP tomorrow!'
Goodbye everyone I will tweet you all when I'm in the Bahamas tomorrow if Zayn comes back DM me
Not even surprised that I already lost my card for the boat &amp; that I was causing issues w/ security bcus I lost it &amp; have to get a new one
In 15 minutes the drill for the boat is happening and the alarms are going to scare me so bad I'm in tears thinking about it
@nolansnuts @itsTaylorBaxter @joeykidney @AlexErnst my husband is the greatest I love you hubby
Jamie is trying to steal Jimmy from me who does she think she is

@19seventyfives @anchordwn ok fuck you Corinne we have cheesecake and no where to sit and you don't
I am in love 
oh mygod 
I'm really not adjusted to the fact that I can't live tweet my cruise
Security grabbed me and had a serious talk with me about selfie sticks nice
Good thing I just got in trouble with security for using a selfie stick
OK CRUISE SHIPS ARE BIG HOLY SJIT
Good thing our shuttle to the boat has a TV and Frozen sing a long is playing 
My mom and I both just thought we saw Liam and I almost ran up to him but I realized it wasn't Liam and now I'm crying
When I go out in the sun I don't tan at all if anything I get paler so I can't wait to see what happens on a cruise for a week
@Alex_Reininga I live for your delusional and sleep deprived tweets after PressPlay omg go home and sleep for 8 weeks
@nolansnuts @jtdscape I think you have forgotten that Jimmy is mine
8 year old brothers are not fun the day before a cruise and have food poisoning and are up all night crying
My week without wifi begins soon I'm not ready
Hmm @tmhsarah

Wish I knew why I'm listening to Snoop Dogg alone in the car while I wait for my mom
Guess who was totally kidding about their last tweet and would never do that
Guess who's on her way to go get a haircut and cut their hair sufficiently short
Never a bad idea to watch Hannah Montana and Kim Possible love stories on YouTube
Can't wait to go on a cruise to Detroit for PressPlay
@steffanargus come on oovoo/skype with me and nolansnuts/Jamie
Why do people like Skype more than Oovoo
@steffanargus or you're that person who's allergic to a lot of unnecessary things
@steffanargus I feel like you're that person who does things that thinks everyone can relate to with but in reality it's just you
really wish all the selfies of girls who met harry last night weren't all over my timeline! that shits offensive!
@Kiss108 @TrevorMoran #asktrevor whats one thing you hate that everyone else loves

@hsbooze @ChristianLeave 
@ChristianLeave #christianpressplayct remember in November when you did one of these Q&amp;As and I was basically the only one w/ questions
@gilletteniall phones broken :/
so used to people just leaving and forgetting about me at this point
@ELUSlVES MY PHONE IS BROKEN GUCK
@steffanargus that was such a fantastic game of evil apples we had we didn't even make it past the 1st round that's impressive
@ELUSlVES u hoe answer my dms
WHY DID I LET THE GUY TALK ME INTO BACKING UP ALL THESE PICTURES FUKC OILH 
@burnwhitesiders how long did it take to ship
my computer has 10 gb left and these 8k pictures is going to destroy that
CALLING APPLE FOR THE 6TH TIME BECAUSE MY PHONE SAYS MY NUMBER IS UNKNOWN AND I CANT SEND/GET TEXTS WHAT THE FUCK
I literally threw a fit in the AT&amp;T store and made them call the worker I was with earlier just because me and that case are inseparable
I called ATT asking if they had my case, they said no, I went to the store, yelled at them, came home, its on my bed 
This is why you should never add your family on Facebook 
I went to AT&amp;T and they have pronounced my phone as "completely broken and a piece of shit and that I need to get a new one next week"
He thanked me for like 3 minutes for calling and in the end he sucked wow he must not get calls often for Apple help
The guy goes "ok. Uh .........‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.......... I think a store might help you. Uh .............. Is there a store near you? Uh..... Ok"
the guy on the phone with me on apple has no clue what he's saying and he keeps saying um and that he doesn't know. thanks
Guess who's on the phone with Apple for issues with her phone and MacBook like always
i just got extra bonus points on the next quiz because i finished a word search first in my class fuck yeah
why is my teacher making us address him as "my lord" today
some people just that natural "i-go-door-to-door-in-neighborhoods-asking-people-if-they-have-a-moment-to-talk-about-jesus" look to them
some girl in my class is sobbing because she wants a hairless cat
We're playing a "How well do you know Frozen?" Kahoot in Biology right now
my tweets during school are always so off im literally thinking and tweeting about everything but school
sunsets are actually the coolest thing ever
ok whatever this is bullshit
I shouldn't care but I do
nothing like being on tumblr in the middle of the night while it's raining outside
@nolansnuts shes listening to the blues now
there is nothing worse than wanting to talk to someone so bad but feeling like you're bothering them
This stuff is saving my life right now it's making me look so tan for banquet 
@steffanargus the worst thing is I actually remember you
hallelujah i just ordered my triangl bikini
@Iykke_Ii @nolansnuts
@jordan_what @tmhsarah @itsallienelson @nolansnuts love you to death

@ChristianLeave solve this issue like a normal person would
guess who's listening to the teen beach movie soundtrack in math
if my teachers asks, no i'm not watching ross lynch best &amp; cutest moments in the middle of math 
I hope my mom doesn't get mad if I order a pizza right now because I'm so hungry
@steffanargus @JacobWhitesides wow I'm really getting a kick out of this game "how many people does it take to turn on public DM's"
@steffanargus this is probably just another addition of dumb twitter updates where you have to be verified to have that option
@steffanargus well it's not under cards and shipping so that's a start
@steffanargus wait wTF ITS NOT ON MINE EITHER HOLD ON ILL FIND IT
@steffanargus YOURE ON YOUR COMPUTER CORRECT
@steffanargus you are definitely over complicating things just go to settings &gt; accounts then scroll down to messages and check the box
Remember when I was 12 and sang the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air theme song at X Factor and told the audience to sing along and no one sang along
and that's exactly why it got 30k notes nice  
does anyone remember this from tumblr from back in the day, I'm so sorry because this was me 
Y.O.L.O.! = you, only, live, once !! &lt;33333 
and i was like baby, baby, baby ooooooh---~~~~~~~!! #selfie

@steffanargus you're right

Ed Sheeran at Gillette is going to absolutely mental
i can't wait to go back to the places i love today in the future and be like ah yes those were the days man
going back to gillette for ed sheeran 13 days after one direction is going to be such an emotional and mental force
i want to kiss ur neck that is all
My dad doesn't think Ed can sell out Gillette well we'll show him
The day this happens I don't even know what I'll do  
Merch that makes no sense that makes people wearing them seem extremely confused 

EST. 2015 - @ChristianLeave

3 days until I meet my very first Internet friend who I've been waiting to meet for 5 years, going to be an incredible day @Miniclipice

If Justin went to Ariana's Mohegan show I would've been front row to him let that sink in
@hsbooze SHUT TUP

@jordan_what @tmhsarah boys LOVE the lyrics to the Macarena

@ughhjill @idekautumn @wtvalexis @idfkat I JUST WANT TO RELIVE THOSE 3 DAYS MORE THAN ANYTHING SOMETHING INTERESTING WAS ALWAYS GOING ON
@ughhjill @idekautumn @wtvalexis @idfkat they all paid for one show but got a second one for free courtesy of us
@idekautumn @wtvalexis @ughhjill @idfkat we sat there for like 45 minutes and caused a scene and made the police take pictures of us
@wtvcaitlyn @idfkat @wtvalexis @idekautumn @ughhjill
The things I would do to be at WWA dancing to the Macarena right now is insane 
I'm looking at all my pictures and videos from concerts from the summer ugh why won't summer hurry up
I'm about to start crying Jamie's train literally leaves in an hour and a half for Chicago
Nolansnuts is taking one for the Boston team and going to Chicago this weekend for PressPlay

I miss Disney 
@virtualhailey I LOVE THIS &amp; WHERE ARE YOUR SHOES FROM
Everything anyone tweets during these times gets so many retweets like I could literally tweet Canadian bacon and it would get 5k retweets
I love my dad 
Day 1 Hour 26 has been a success thank you Liam
Quick someone locate a tattoo parlor that will tattoo people who are under 18 im getting "for the time being" engraved on every inch of me
Most important phrases from the TL:
"for the time being"
"it's far from over"
"I don't think any of us understand"
"some of the worst times"
I already knew it was far from over but it's good that Liam can confirm that we all needed to hear that
and im crying again
Liams twitlonger RT to save a life 
@Real_Liam_Payne a for effort it won't work
All I ask right now is for this damn twit longer to load this isn't even funny
ITS NOT LOADING
A TWITLONGER OJH NO
‚Äú@StopRory: . @ModestMgmt bad move guys, bad move. You just lost lots of money and respect.‚Äù

And this is why I love Rory
This sums up how everyone thought in 2013 One Direction was going to break up just because Zayn got engaged 

I miss when the only Zayn related drama there was was when he got a new tattoo
@tiedyechristian <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@ChristianLeave I got sick of this the second you beat me in followers
wtffffff zayn
I AM SO IN LOVE WITH LIAM ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY
@CLINGYCHRISTIAN @Maxgschneider the m&amp;g is 10-11 PM wtf and the show isn't until midnight
Someone go see @Maxgschneider with me in Rhode Island April 11
Did he quit or did he get fired the world may never know
My mom goes "at least Justin Timberlake didn't get hit by a truck" thanks like that's going to help the situation
Listening to Just Can't Let Her Go isn't helping the situation
Does anyone else read all of Nialls tweets in his accent
@NiallOfficial love you
You are the best fans in the world and you deserve nothing less from us!
‚Äú@zaynmalik: lol and breath ...im joking wanted t see yur guys reactions LOl ;P‚Äù 

is this tweet still valid now please say yes
I'm so grateful that I'm not in school
The day I finally get "All the love" tattooed somewhere will be the greatest day of my life
@ChristianLeave 92k
‚Äú@techniallology: HE SAID "while Zayn's here" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME 
Zayn Malik left One Direction today, and honestly it's still blowing my mind.
well that's enough for one day
im dying to know what everything will be like a year from today
It kills knowing that I'll be thinking back to this day and this moment for the rest of my life
All I want to do is get out of bed so I can get ready to get back into bed but I don't have the strength to move
@BLITZEDGILINSKY wait do you still have it up on your screen can u screenshot it
@BLITZEDGILINSKY YOURE KIDDING
If you have to go to school tomorrow, don't take shit from ANYONE, you're allowed to be upset and hurt
I've never seen more people come together on the Internet over something in a long time
@eunoiamgc THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN JESUS CHRIST THIS IS GOLD
43,000 LOOPS W T F 
On the bright side at least it didn't end the same way the Beatles did with one of the members getting shot
It'll all work out in the end, that wasn't the last time they would EVER be on a stage together, there's plenty of time for reunion shows
@idekautumn that's fucking insane to even begin to think about
I was at the first show of One Directions in the US May 22, 2012, and I'll be at the last show of theirs in the US September 12, 2015
I need a really cute guy to bring tons of ice cream and chocolate and flowers to my doorstep right now
@E3MENDES @zaynmalik of course
This whole "March Madness" thing was a curse on One Direction
forever proud that I took these 
At this point I'll probably be crying until my head falls off
My mom &amp; her friends conversation 
I always dreamed of flying to wherever in the world the official last One Direction concert was, but now that'll never happen
This is so crazy
@maybem0nica it just hit 20k loops too oh my god what the hell
@bandhyped RIGHT
Read this 

@bandhyped BIZ
‚Äú@hellakiara: @wtvcaitlyn your crying video just got rted on my personal tl‚Äù WTF IS GOING ON
imagine Zayn going to watch the boys show lmao
My mentions are exploding right now because of this 

@futureslouis glad I can help inspire!
The first thing I said to my mom was "I can never thank you or repay you enough for getting me catwalk seats to my last One Direction show"
Now my mom came home and to my room to check up on me and she started crying because she's never seen me like this
It sucks because this isn't something that'll blow over in a day it's something you'll constantly have to be reminded about until you die
@xoaleahaaa beauty guru right here
I wish someone recorded my reaction when I found out in class I just went completely pale and got up crying and left the class
Can I just address the fact that my school chose TODAY of ALL DAYS for the Backstreet Boys &amp; NSYNC to be played in the hallways
Do I even look on instagram
today's makeup look inspired by Zayn Malik 
It looks like I have halloween makeup on but no 
@ChristianLeave you're killing me
He just walked in the room and saw me on my bed and immediately started ranting
My dad just came in and hugged me so hard and talked so much to me about the situation I love my dad more than anyone else in the world
I had catwalk seats for the very last One Direction show I would ever see in my life...
I HSUT cried my contacts into the back of my head and I can't find smthem
I can't stop listening to their music
One of the most difficult things about this situation is that some people from school will just never understand
I read the first sentence of the Facebook post and left the class in tears
Now what
It wasn't suppose to end like this
why couldn't they have just given them the break they needed WHY did they have to push them to the LITERAL BREAKING POINT
hes not leaving thats not even something im capable of processing
everyone in my class is staring at me becaus ei cant stop lcryin gin hte back of the roo m

@darrenandbrad true true
@darrenandbrad yeah but I just don't understand the people who have strict methods of putting mascara on just like put it on your eyelashes
Am I the only one that thinks some people out there take the way you apply makeup way too seriously
I'm so scared and excited to go on a cruise help
I might be meeting Jack and Jack in a few weeks oh my god
Can they add the Pussycat Dolls to the Kiss108 lineup that would be a pleasant surprise
Can a miracle please happen I need to somehow end up with tickets for tomorrow
Try to name one thing more entertaining than watching @StopRory on YouNow with @itsallienelson and @nolansnuts; you can't
Everyone prepare for pictures of me and @ELUSlVES in a few weeks on our cruise
@harryclouds when are they gonna be here

Also please is there anyone who is selling Fifth Harmony tickets tomorrow in Boston because I'm so dESPARate at this point
I'm very jealous of Shawn though he gets to meet Mattie so much and I still haven't
Shawn and Mattie are my favorite celebrity &amp; fan relationship in the whole wide world I bow down to them
Why is Liam such a great person
why did i chose to watch the video of harry singing i will survive during school why did no one stop me
@virtualwesley check my last tweet to joe and his reply, im so pissed it better start at 2
If the Kiss 108 concert seriously doesn't start until 5 this year we're going to have a serious issue
@joep108 does the kiss 108 concert really not start until 5 this year?
I really hope they add Village People to the Kiss 108 lineup! I would LOVE to see the YMCA LIVE !
I really hope they add Rednex to the Kiss 108 lineup! I would LOVE to see the Cotton Eyed Joe LIVE !
@the1975ed i knoww thats why i said pray its not the same day because i didnt want those 2 interfering
I'm so mad I don't have tickets for Fifth Harmony tomorrow but either way I see them at Kiss 108
And they still have 5-10 more people to announce over the next 2 months
