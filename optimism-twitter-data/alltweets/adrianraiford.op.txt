@mattyglesias too soon?
@mattyglesias @MarkHalperin @BobbyJindal no conflicts in critiquing your competition!? Just high minded objectivity!
@MarkHalperin you already tweeted this
@JBarodhede @TeamMarco Irish but whatever
@TeamMarco how is this different than Obama?
@mattyglesias @emmaspan if this is what you think is "mind blowing", then Dalton must have sheltered you too much. Real world is much worse
@CKain @JWerthsBeard this happens, even at Wrigley
@daveweigel @peterwtrue @alexburnsNYT @DylanByers not possible as they can't be from the same state under the Constitution
@chrislhayes @BillSimmons lots of $$$ on non disparagement clause
@greghoward88 @joshtpm Bill Simmons got himself fired to deflect attention from deflate gate and Brady. It's so obvious. wake up sheeple!
@williamfleitch Bill Simmons got himself fired to deflect attention from deflate gate and his BFF Brady. It's so obvious. wake up sheeple!
@NateSilver538 @bycoffe you know who else is looking for a sports media job?
@charlescwcooke do libertarians have anyone to vote for in the UK?
@ParisBurned @chrislhayes and he will give you his all
@BillSimmons @JalenRose @dmorey @DianaTaurasi how much $$$ did they offer for non-disparage agreement???
@BillSimmons this was the tweet that terminated your contract, right?
@alexburnsNYT garbage in, garbage out
@EricLiptonNYT what will we do without 
@joshtpm and they make a much bigger margin in broadband internet
@GoofyFoot70 young at heart
@dcsportsbog ITS ALL YOUR FAULT
@jesseclee44 
@jesseclee44 plus Hillary
@samsteinhp ^best young runners in America /fixed
@MenInBlazers @barneyronay  Boateng and Neuer are among the best in the world. Denied Suarez and Neymar many times. But not the master
@mattyglesias @TeamMuriel because it's a Redskins town.
@CapitalsHill @_JakeRussell  TONY TWO BAGS
@TheFix it's worth noting that Boateng is one of the best defenders in the world
@arseblog haha
@whatahowler @arseblog @Gatorade @markillustrates most definitely
@whatahowler @arseblog @Gatorade @markillustrates I'm gonna need a new keyboard
@EmilyGlazerWSJ @Chase BUT you sd correct the story. She says "Happy Friday!" every day. Not just on Friday. That's how optimistic she is!
@EmilyGlazerWSJ @Chase Ivette is a great great person. Really a spark!
@MLBNetworkRadio @dcsportsbog right. No worries then! Just a RIB OUT OF PLACE
@ColMorrisDavis @chrislhayes @markberman 1000% correct. False imprisonment is an actionable tort
@TheFix is that you behind home plate at Nats Park?
@zengerle @GlennThrush @NickGass more like his inner Adam Carolla
@FightinHydrant Roark trying to "unintentionally" walk Stanton but then striking him out was mvp IMHO
@dcsportsbog some of us never stopped talking about the Hogs
@Neil_Irwin @JohnJHarwood there is also a perspective on this that he was trying to improve information flow for regular riders
@MenInBlazers @SamBorden for some reason I bought a baseball hat at Yankee Stadium with both NY and Anaheim Angels logos for the ALCS
@TheNatidude 5-5
@Hadas_Gold I was late for school pickup. Major bummer
@gunnerblog A beautiful day!
@mattyglesias presumably Jon Snow will manifest his heritage by surviving dragon fire?
@GPollowitz @charlescwcooke 4th/5th/6th amend protections all have limits. Why not the precious Second Amendment?
@GPollowitz @charlescwcooke It is plainly obvious that all rights have limits. Child porn/slander/libel aren't protected by the first amend
@daveweigel the low mpg is a killer
@PostSports @dcsportsbog can he buy the Redskins too? Kthxbye
@mattyglesias wiz didn't play on Saturday so...
@mattyglesias yahoo bots already write great recaps of fantasy football matchups
@mattyglesias like the contract for America but with easy Stonehenge Spinal Tap jokes
@JWerthsBeard that's ballgame
@JWerthsBeard that's 2
@JWerthsBeard that's 1
@gavinpurcell get a mangrate
@MikeJonesWaPo awesome
@jmartNYT hardly a "beating"
@mattyglesias if I had a nickel every time I said this at dinner parties...
@williamfleitch @GQMagazine did you ask him if he got laid before a big fight or abstained?
@ScottSAllen @dcsportsbog  he's welcome to take over from his brother ANYTIME
@NBCdianna @_JakeRussell  the Hogs were lunch pail type of guys
@JReidESPN and we play the Jets October 18
@JReidESPN need is greater on OL
@MikeJonesWaPo #21 should be retired
@TheNatsBlog isn't that always his way?
@masnKolko the night is young
@charlescwcooke only two photos? Very disappointing
@jbouie @chrislhayes I can see the Hillary of 1992-2000 giving this speech
@jmartNYT did we all forget how much more liberal Hillary was compared to Bill?
@masnKolko Scherzer v Harvey!!!??
@DylanByers just unfollowed you for auto posting 6 posts in a row. Spam not wanted
@charlescwcooke judges - at least in the Anglo-American vein - have always made the law as well as interpreted statutes
@charlescwcooke hundreds of years of common law created by judges without statutes suggests you don't understand how judiciary works
@RealCJ10 @NatsEnquirer and your highest salary player did it for the Nats!
@BrandonfrmNJ @williamfleitch but soccer does it as a punishment for the home side fans being racists or Nazis. Does Baltimore deserve this?
@JWerthsBeard great reverse jinx!!! Nats Win!  Aahhhoooghhaaa!
@JWerthsBeard yessir
@NatsEnquirer just a starting pitcher pinch runner
@masnKolko WHO???  LOL
@JWerthsBeard sack up!
@JWerthsBeard wasn't that game 5 of the 2012 NLDS?
.@SmargJones &lt;---- this guy is a disgusting racist
@JWerthsBeard all underwear will be worn outside the uniforms
@HayesChels @Kurt_Vonnegut my point: Many think the great man is posting comments on current events
@HayesChels @Kurt_Vonnegut not my point
@charlescwcooke reasonable notice period
@drewmagary like Deadspin doesn't have an agenda to take down its rivals. Such bullshit
@chrislhayes oh please
@JWerthsBeard when is Tony two bags back?
@richeisen been to the stadium yet this year, Rich? Yankees fans love ARod. They are dying for something to celebrate.
@bpolitics ^closeted gay man John Roberts /fixed
@masnKolko the irony is that he - like Pete Rose and Barry Bonds - will be more famous than half the guys in the HOF for decades to come
@joshtpm economic liberty theory of the right wd allow SCt to return to Lochner era / invalidate laws that infringe the "right to contract"
@MenInBlazers the Arsenal fans applaud Fabregas - except the bloke on the lower left... 
@nealbrennan saw this at Museum of Arts and Design in Manhattan
@TheNatidude @ithrow88 nice jinx
@MenInBlazers sunning himself, watching the ocean waves. And smiling
@MenInBlazers 3-0 all the more amazing given Rog is actually watching
@jameshohmann @jmartNYT so did polygamy
@JohnCassidy just occurred to me: how will we cover the 2016 election without intrade?
@charlescwcooke middle class modesty
@anthonyweiner Brooklyn for the most part
@charlescwcooke but it is shockingly hard to bet on sports, unlike the UK
@charlescwcooke custom license plates that don't cost Â£1000
@DylanByers @robertguest1 @JohnPrideaux isn't Rick Perry under indictment?
@moshekasher why are you in Rome but @nealbrennan is in Madrid?
@daveweigel and if it's a high powered Russian investment bank then what?
@JackWilshere I love that this tweet about Englishness contains bad grammar and a typo.
@daveweigel do you use the word "dynast" to describe Luke Russert? Or Willie Geist?
@bpolitics @JebBush sure he is
@elizabethforma @JohnJHarwood you're scaremongering and it's shameful
@charlescwcooke @GlennThrush @tedcruz that was mocked by his opponent
@charlescwcooke @GlennThrush @tedcruz you omitted the absurd Cruz assertion that the hymen would be "visible mark" of infidelity
@motokorich @jmartNYT @jasondhorowitz Hero
@dcsportsbog you mean most people click on the huge story "above the fold"? Shocking
@TheNatsBlog @MLBGIFs the casual, almost laconic, approach was so fucking cool
@dcsportsbog wrong!!!!!!
@dcsportsbog winner winner chicken dinner!
@BeschlossDC nice "Bull Durham" advert
@masnKolko tony two bags!
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel indeed
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel fair enough description but you're just as guilty of exaggeration as Strickland's silly email, no?
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel "people" implies humanity and fullness of personhood. Corporations are a legal fiction
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel "corporations can't enforce a contract"
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel saying "corporations are not people" is not like saying "corporations have no standing in court" or
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel you can't expect spam political fundraising email to parse the finer legal details. But
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel my point is that the expansion of corporate personhood isn't 200 years old. It's much more recent
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel 73 years does not equal "200 years" as you tweeted. #fuzzymath
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel so 1942 was the 19th century?
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel but none of those 19th C cases applied the Bill of Rights to corp. Free speech and religion is absurd for corp
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel in 1888, Pembina v Penn. did state, as an assumption, "there is no doubt that a private corp" is a person
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel you could point to 1886 and Santa Clara v Southern Pacific (14th Amend) but that wasn't part of the holding
@charlescwcooke @daveweigel "personhood" for corp has not been a part of law for 200 years. Standing, yes. Dartmouth v Woodward (1819)
.@chrislhayes - I was against the war and thought the NYT trafficked in lies but that was still a deeply unfair interview with J Miller.
@ezraklein I know people in Oakland who claim credit for the after school theory
@mattyglesias but check the  battleground state polls
@ezraklein it's an exaggeration to say "everything they told you about milk is a lie"
@RobLowe @HillaryClinton @JebBush @RandPaul @ScottWalker the Clinton narrative is "you can't trust her"
@jmpayne24 @JWerthsBeard @thisisdspan @Bharper3407 not until we get Tony Two Bags back
@Kurt_Vonnegut you died in 2007, so no, you don't
@mattyglesias it already exists. Milk and Cookies on NYC's upper east side
@DeanBaker13 @mattyglesias I used to work at Hertz at Dulles, counting cars. I was replaced by a bar code scanner. Literally
@bpolitics @marcorubio RINO!
@JWerthsBeard true
@HarperAtBat .@williamfleitch
@williamfleitch @HarperAtBat you mean @Bharper3407 ?
@dcsportsbog that towing company is a MENACE. She was justified
@daveweigel context is important before we all fly off the handle with another stupid Twitter condemnation contest
@daveweigel that towing company is a MENACE and is notorious in Arlington
@DylanByers I think the towing company is terrible. Context is vital to understanding
@MarkHalperin what front other that "trust"?
@richeisen @RichEisenShow @AlbertBreer @TheJetOnTNT @Dodgers @kelly_rohrbach no pic of Lasorda?
@daveweigel the NYT article on Hillary's launch spent three paragraphs quoting Bob Shrum. Three!
@bpolitics loaded question = invalid result
@ezraklein damn you
@_cingraham @daveweigel @farhip look up "misprision of felony"
.@GioGonzalez47 lose the beard, dude. It's too thin @TheNatsBlog @NatsEnquirer
@brooksbarnesNYT @mashable thanks
@MrMichaelLee @_JakeRussell the truth
@chrislhayes @AndrewStilesUSA you're right. We should only listen to elites
@chrislhayes "I am literally flaccid right now"
@GoofyFoot70 like Kramer? 
@Hadas_Gold @brianbeutler two words: Cory Booker
@TheNatsBlog @dcsportsbog Bullets 78, Redskins 83, 87 and 91. I count a few NL East crowns as "major wind"
@ezraklein of course in a sane world the Congress and the President could just amend the law
@ezraklein sand for

@ezraklein ta dado
@ezraklein I bet you wish Twitter had an edit function!
@costareports @hardball did HE eat at Chipotle?
@RichardHaass @JohnJHarwood @nytdavidbrooks "most emailed" means "favorite among old boomers who don't understand tech"
@gunnerblog cesc should have come home
@NatsEnquirer maybe this is what got you blocked by Boz?
@arseblog @MenInBlazers check the ad - "CWR SCAFFOLD for the perfect erection" 
@NatsEnquirer was this about him not backing up home plate?
@JohnJHarwood @tedcruz as a veteran, this kind of sentiment always makes me laugh.
@FightinHydrant that's one
@Choire Jealous he didn't get on the cover? Write a better book.
@samsteinhp Cruz is the Teardrop for Liberty
@Golf54deciple @chrislhayes 
@Golf54deciple @chrislhayes seen it before.
@Golf54deciple @chrislhayes how can you be sure it was all men?
@swirsk054 @chrislhayes sacrilege!
@BeschlossDC Sinatra wasn't referring to himself as top dog
@MarkHalperin why you're almost suggesting that the press has its own agenda... Hmmmm....
@MarkHalperin you do understand the arrogance that you're displaying?
@gunnerblog @rabonamag criticism of Ãzil's style of play is like criticism of a bullfighter's technique. In the end the bull is dead.
@maggieNYT @alexburnsNYT last time I was there I saw Ethan Hawke on a vintage bicycle
@alexburnsNYT @maggieNYT and Lena Dunham too
@alexburnsNYT @maggieNYT Lenham Dunham went to school just down the block. Hip enuf?
@TheConfect @arseblog this is fantastic
@brithume @guypbenson it's called "negotiation"
@peterbakernyt @BFischerMartin @mj_lee @alexburnsNYT @jmartNYT and my baby girl Avery born today

@samsteinhp I hate him so much
@DanBarryNYT adjacent property

@thehill @brithume oh god who cares?
@abe_squad @dcsportsbog @afigman Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
@pierce_jeffrey @MadMaxMovie but does he eat dog food? That's what I want to know.
@CBSNews @WillieGeist in other words, I call bullshit
@CBSNews @WillieGeist that son must be super popular with his stepsister
@Awl will Awl commenter cocktail party notices be included? Not to brag, but I am #174
@Awl same as the old newsletter? (Infrequent, rambling and pointless?)
@NateSilver538 critical error by Hitler was blocking four-engine bomber for Luftwaffe. Long range. That would have been devastating.
@GlennThrush @nytdavidbrooks wasn't this @sullydish 's position?
@RyanJBernal @drewmagary needs a Dunkin Donuts letter
@daveweigel @DavidRutz he seems like the only person who would take the job
@gavinpurcell @nytimes poor James Milner
@BillSimmons it's pathetic that you are a WWE fan.
@PostSports @dcsportsbog that's damn misleading headline. Article predicts departures a year or two from now
@gunnerblog john terry of course
@jmartNYT one foul shot made. One missed
@mattyglesias gen AA
@normmacdonald @JohnJHarwood what? He called for the whole arena to applaud Notre Dame
@ThomasBoswellWP dantley delivered the mail before the mail man
@MenInBlazers cup of tea for her this morning and I'm taking the kids to the park
@alexburnsNYT the P-word? You from Sesame Street?
@GoofyFoot70 @lenadunham I am ambivalent. Very funny writing but shameless sensationalistic crap
@SebiSalazarCSN @dcsportsbog oh god, he's wearing his stupid logo. RGME
@ProFootballTalk is he still in the NFL?
@gunnerblog @BGoebert @arseblog 7'10" monster player with soft touch in the ball and a job as an uber driver
@moshekasher I laughed
@chrislhayes he's insufferable. #BearDownArizona
@ProFootballTalk @jmartNYT sorry JMart. You'll bounce back
@AdamKilgoreWP great story. BEARDOWN
@myohmaya7 @dcsportsbog @MenInBlazers #sportofthefuture
@reihan oh god, unfollowed #soboring
@daveweigel @tedcruz "see them driven before us and hear the lamentations of their women..."
@ezraklein isn't that stat meaningless? Costs more to pay American teacher, build a school in America, etc.?
@arseblog I agree with every one. Ospina is too small. Can't kick it past the halfway line
@GoofyFoot70 why?
@MikeJonesWaPo that's just stating the obvious
@peterlattman @helena_andrews and POTUS too, although only summer associate
@peterlattman @helena_andrews FLOTUS used to work there
@Doranimated @reihan if you believe that then I have a bridge to sell you
@JoeNBC @JayCaruso @nytimes of course
@smellsfischy @MenInBlazers Newcastle fan?
@MenInBlazers @NBCSports fuel for my nightmares. Thanks
@AnnaHolmes @chrislhayes @jsmooth995 @allinwithchris he doesn't look "black" so he probably doesn't experience the same discrimination
@DylanByers @alexnazaryan @RollingStone sadly that is true
@JoeNBC not very gracious, Joe
@arseblognews @arseblog not too shabby
@bpolitics @tedcruz ad for a Chevy?
@mcpli @jmartNYT timbuk3 and Flock of Seagulls?! AND Alex Chilton?!!
@joshtpm the video felt like an ad for a Chevy
@gunnerblog me too
@gunnerblog Southampton
@JackWilshere cesc is NOT a traitor. He went home to Barca and then wanted to come to Arsenal but Wenger said no. Chelsea is his last resort
@JackWilshere @CescF4bregas El Capitan is no traitor
@JackWilshere @CescF4bregas cesc was not a traitor. He went home to Barca and no true arsenal fan holds that against him.
@daveweigel the bible scam was perfect
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald enjoy mi amigo
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald it's a reference to the movie stripes with Bill Murray and Harold Ramis.
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald lighten up Francis
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald whoa, if true
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald no shit, Sherlock. But that is irrelevant
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald what does that have to do with infringements on civil rights?
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald you know she's dead, right?
@DealWaeIt @ggreenwald your argument is invalid
@timothypmurphy @jonathanchait @BuzzFeedAndrew @jonfavs wrong Carolina
@MonaHol @ggreenwald #firstworldproblems #worldssmallestviolin #waaaaa
@MonaHol @ggreenwald how is that a "bigger threat"? One would slaughter thousands if they could while the other does what exactly?
@ggreenwald you've said some stupid things before but that assertion is so wildly hyperbolic as to be ludicrous.
@arseblog I blame Bono
@daveweigel you need to smile on TV. And not that half-second fake smile.
@JoeNBC haha. Get into the CL first
@MesutOzil1088 bravo Mesut. You are always a champion
@arseblog proud of the boys. And we have too much on our plate as it is.
@mattyglesias semiserious #dadwitter question: how much would it cost to put up a bubble over a playground in the winter time?

@jonathanalter @VideoLinkLLC yeah, like Bradley was such a great help to Gore!

@arseblog stop talking rubbish. Next you'll say Terry stepped on Oscar's head and tackled Cahill on a corner
@Puddinstrip @pattonoswalt I'm so sorry for your loss

@MarkHalperin delete your account

@anamariecox NO. Just no.
@PureMitten @ron_fournier @JoeNBC well now, that's a novel legal concept.
@JohnWonderlich @anamariecox in a world with husbands who have already created the email and have secret service protection for it.
@ron_fournier @JoeNBC how is it a public server? She owns it. Paid for it. Put it on her property.
@politico what a dipshit
@ESPNFC @gunnerblog @_nachomonreal WELBZ
@gunnerblog @arsenalist 
@gunnerblog if Wenger had to fight another manager for the premiership title, who would be the easiest to defeat? The hardest?
@gunnerblog could have done with more laughing
@arseblog There's only one Danny Wilbeck!!
@arseblog @DanielHarris could have been 4-1 but for de gea
@arseblog I'll be THERE in sunshine or in shadow
@MenInBlazers put a smile on my face that's for sure
@gunnerblog welbz or Sanchez will score
@bpolitics @daveweigel @GovernorOMalley what about Dunbar running to the left of Clinton? Or Jackie Sharp with her war record?
@MoonbatCatnip @GlennThrush @TheRickWilson yeah, Gowdy knew all of this last summer and sat on it
@GlennThrush @TheRickWilson I like how he highlights the mainstream press role in exposing Clinton's email scandal. Wait, what?
@RealSway @MarkHalperin easy to spot the secret service agent
@gunnerblog need to play the side who won away to City
@gunnerblog nacho needs to start.

@johndickerson wtf with that picture??
@nickconfessore @daveweigel Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution
@the_intercept @ggreenwald @maassp one designed to punish malicious leaks and the other to deal with harmless foot faults?

@indiewire @adamcarolla so you hate dogs? That's weird
@MenInBlazers @arseblog awesome
@arseblog and here is the rest of the greatest hits - 
@arseblog here's the greatest hits - 
@MenInBlazers wanker
@daveweigel Washington monument. Or Lincoln
@jmartNYT my favorite season
@arseblog Ozil took the corner
@MenInBlazers @arseblog stopped swearing but didn't quiet down. A big "COME ON YOU GUNNER!" late in stoppage time
@arseblog looks to be too close to American microphones
@ezraklein my thought was annual expenditure of $500 billion, which would exceed defense budget
@arseblog here's one of the clean shouts 
@arseblog for shame... 
@arseblog @MenInBlazers  I hope you can get together on a podcast or the show to discuss the, uh, "background noise" on NBCSN today
â@mattyglesias: A very telling tweet: 
@arseblog best match commentary I've heard. Ever.
@gunnerblog oh ye of little faith
@arseblog highlight of my day
@anthonyweiner no
@OfficialAFC_US @Small_Meadow it's going to get AWKWARD if the arsenal don't beat Everton right before this airs
@anamariecox this finally explains all the anal sex
@mattyglesias arming the mujahideen in Afganistan? Boycotting Olympics? First Gulf War?
@mattyglesias WTF with the auto play videos? I got Vox video on XYY as a popup. Very annoying
@glh278 @davidfrum as laudable a project as the Whitney is, I don't think it's rigorous scholarship. Seems like performance art
@glh278 @davidfrum also the article is wrong because the slave mart goes back to 1938, not 2007
@glh278 @davidfrum have you been? It covers a lot of the history of slavery, from Atlantic trade to after imports were banned
@jwpetersNYT @samsteinhp whatajerk
@portraitinflesh @davidfrum I think black folks prefer a more heroic narrative and white folks want to forget it all
@davidfrum there is one in Charleston already so this wouldn't be the first
@gwenifill delete your account
@mattyglesias attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion
@arseblog Ospina is too small
@gunnerblog same shit different day. Just like Bayern two years ago
@MenInBlazers same score as Bayern Munich 2 years ago. Then we beat them 2-0
@anthonyweiner @Almond_NYC isn't that place owned by your brother? #fulldisclosure

@brithume @MZHemingway @FDRLST fair points but how about maternity leave?
@daveweigel @davidpodhaskie Korea was a tie. We won Vietnam but the North breached the treaty two years later
@gunnerblog too small
@gunnerblog are you suggesting that overtaking City is a possibility? #daft
@repjohnlewis @jmartNYT proud to share a birthday with you
@arseblog happy birthday to me!!!
@arseblog best Arsenal team since 2005
@arseblog never a second of doubt
@gunnerblog never doubted this team
@MenInBlazers THIRD DEGREE BURNLEY
@dcsportsbog No no no, a thousand times NO
@chrislhayes PLEASE invite Colbert on your show to talk about "Papa Bear" O'Reilly
@davidfrum also tickets for hot Broadway plays
@EricBoehlert walker reminds me of Nixon
@daveweigel Actually not even an American, if that word means "someone pledged to defend the Constitution"
@williamfleitch slow, fat, prone to injury and  still rich as fuck
@AdamKilgoreWP when I taught in Houston there were "feeder schools" at elementary level for junior high football. 9 year olds!
@arseblog I know.
@arseblog I was horrified by an entry on the liveblog - "kike" - at 90+. I checked lineups and saw Boro player is actually "kike". Sorry

@foxandfriends KKK was Christian terrorism. Abortion clinic bombers inspired by Christianity
@JonahNRO @brithume abortion clinic bombers are Christian terrorists
@JonahNRO @brithume the KKK was Christian terrorism
@MarkHalperin @SenRandPaul "wound up with" does suggest causation
@Choire I was always amazed that The Dish had no comments. Better in some ways but also worse. It spoke in one voice only
@HowardKurtz @brithume it's ok because he signed an executive order exempting himself?? Imagine if POTUS did that!  Abuse of power
@jmartNYT @Kelly_Evans what a jerk
@Timodc @jmartNYT @chipsmithdc so Nationwide does sell life insurance for children? They don't sell premises liability insurance?
@adamcarolla - Did Baldwin steal your TD celebration by pooping the ball?
@GoofyFoot70 that's a generational thing.
@dcsportsbog I GOT SINGLE MALT FOR YOU JOHN
@arseblog goal difference will be important. SH still +3
@WillieGeist @KimKardashian he's just worried about his scattered, smothered and covered order
@nealbrennan @chrisdelia #fakelookingmovie 
@JoeNBC I'm cheering for Cambridge to win the FA Cup replay next week!
@chrislhayes not to mention the home mortgage interest deduction on second homesâ¦
@TheNatsBlog no and yes. He's a great manager. Rolled the dice a few times and came up snake eyes
@bpolitics somebody needs to teach these kids how to salute properly.
@NateSilver538 I dream of a gondola or zipline from a midtown skyscraper that will take 10 minutes to LGA and 25 minutes to JFK/EWR.
@dcsportsbog N E V E R C H A N G E T H E N A M E
@costareports fun fact: Joe changed the pronunciation of his name to rhyme with Heisman Trophy. He was Joey Theesman before college
@jackshafer @carolynryan @nytimes unfollow.
@MrGeorgeWallace feb 1
@LauraChapin @JohnJHarwood @bomani_jones @rodimusprime in Virginia it is Lee-Jackson-King Day (for Stonewall)
@joshtpm @TPM let me guess his race. Wait, don't tell me!
@BillKristol @brithume @WarriorLodge that does not have the ring of authenticity IMHO
@RobLowe @felofHe "hi, I'm devastating debater Rob Lowe"
@DylanByers @brianstelter @msnbc but NBC gets two debates. So hardly a snub. ABC/CBS only have one
@markknoller @JohnJHarwood ambassador was there. That's senior enough. Potus would convey legitimacy on some dodgy characters by attending
@nytimes @ravisomaiya Gotham One
@daveweigel @craignewman @politico 3 Fox, 2 CNN, 2 NBC, 1 ABC and 1 CBS. where's the news?
@hhavrilesky CHROME
@MikeJonesWaPo @MarkMaske yes!!!
@jaketapper federalism!!
@mattyglesias NY Palace?
@jaketapper @AFieldCNN entrapment is the FBI counter terrorism handbook
@MikeJonesWaPo isn't our offensive line more mobile in order to facilitate RG3?
@ezraklein @tvoti coincidence is not causation. It's a logical leap to connect diversity of academy to one movie's "snub"
@ericrich is CPS alleging a crime was committed? Or that these children are in danger?
@bpolitics @JebBush Hispanic wife and "little brown babies" (in the words of GHWB)
@chrislhayes also, aren't you from the Bronx?? How come ur a Bulls fan?
@chrislhayes 
@BulletsForever @Wizards_Fanpage 
@Coopdizzle05 @ouij @bmcnally14 Niners DC was target but Niners refused. Now he is on the market given Tomsula is new SF HC
@TylerClippard thank you Clip!
@chrislhayes @msnbc fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. And hate leads to ... the Dark Side.
@jmartNYT he's completely deranged and detached from reality. (Gelb, that is)
@DylanByers geez, that's a huge over reaction
@drewmagary @bomani_jones sp does Obama get any credit? He called for CFP
@daveweigel Obama = ?
@samsteinhp your Jedi mind powers are amazing
@richeisen scored too early
@joshtpm @TPM this isn't what I follow you for. Click bait is beneath you
@JReidPost bourbon
@JPFinlayCSN @dcsportsbog except it needs a brewski
@PostSports @dcsportsbog yeah, when pigs fly
@Redskins @dcsportsbog @TherealTaraji @EmpireFOX what the hell does she have to do with the Redskins?
@MikeJonesWaPo why not include Griffin in that list? He's a bust
@JohnJHarwood @StephenJack4 I'm a veteran so I see the NYPD back-turning and slowdown as rank insubordination and dereliction of duty
@chrislhayes Yes, but Elsa is still the worst sister ever. Ignores Anna, even after their parents die??
@ScottSAllen @dcsportsbog like Shaun Alexander? Bc he was great...
@PostSports @dcsportsbog @ScottSAllen of course
@superwuster @ezraklein guys American grill? That's an embarrassment.
@adamcarolla fake Teresa will be missed but I'm still a subscriber and listener
@JohnJHarwood I had the same moment. For shame
@MenInBlazers Sanchez (Alexis and Mark)
@MenInBlazers most definitely watching
@AdamSchefter Redskins beat Tampa Bay with 151 yards in 2005 playoffs
@MikeJonesWaPo can't be anything but an improvement
@MikeJonesWaPo whooooo?
@mitchellreports @JoeNBC in 1991 GHWB looked invincible. So did Mario chicken out? Still hurting from losses to Ed Koch?
@jmseabrook @ravisomaiya #crimingwhilewhite
@a_mikhail @gunnerblog let's see what the transfer window brings
@a_mikhail @gunnerblog what do we think of Tottenham?!
@gunnerblog not for long. Spuds are shite
@Choire get off my lawn, ya lousy kids!
@MenInBlazers own goal to mertesacker
@jaketapper 
@richeisen this has Redskins written all over it
@samsteinhp @justin_fenton @GovernorOMalley looks like somebody is running for president
@MikeJonesWaPo fantastic!
@dcsportsbog @jakewhitacre you know who else laughed?
@dcsportsbog @jakewhitacre I know the scores. not a funny joke.
@jakewhitacre @dcsportsbog except that the Skins won in Dallas this year
@bpolitics NYC is a no-brainer. Cockblocks the inevitable Hilary Clinton Presidential Library
@joshtpm just remember to blame the coming crime wave on PAT LYNCH
@JoeNBC @nytimes hardly an "attack"!
Just 3 days left to donate to @KuponaFdn b4 the New Year! Read about #littlevictories &amp; help make 15  more victorious 

@JamesRisen @jaketapper seems like signing the Paris peace accords and passing Case-Church in 1973 to "end" Vietnam war.
@DWPscumbags @nealbrennan Direct U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973. capture of Saigon in April 1975 marked end of the war
@DWPscumbags @nealbrennan 
@DWPscumbags @nealbrennan we won the Vietnam War, signed a treaty and pulled out. A few years later the North invaded and we did nothing
@nealbrennan more like 23-1-1
@ProFootballTalk how about now?
@dcsportsbog Gruden needed to break Griffin into little pieces and rebuild
@davidfrum stoner paranoia = slow and careful
@arseblog Podolski should start both of the next two games
@ZacBoyer LIAR
@BillKristol @JoeNBC and two losing tickets too
@ChrisRyan77 what about Altman's tracking shot at the beginning of The Player?  
@mattyglesias so good. Push Jordan to his left and he falls apart
@daveweigel no
@JohnJHarwood she does not nail it like he does. Allison is fully realized but doesn't seem like she's from montauk
@richeisen @kendallaperry Redskins v Dallas!!!
@billbarnwell @dcsportsbog he thought he saw Godzilla coming?
@drewmagary I have been searching for YEARS for the name of these books! Thanks!
@adamnagourney disgusting rhetoric
@bencelestino "intangibles"
@JReidPost no jinx!
@dcsportsbog "intangibles"
@AdamSchefter Redskins?
@bigredhamilton @MenInBlazers Cubans mostly use hard dollars as currency
@MenInBlazers fuck that. Baseball is king in Cuba. And the MLB team there would be an immediate contender
@billmaher yes. The budget eliminates the federal ban on medical marijuana
@BCAppelbaum @ezraklein very funny
@adamnagourney correct. Most consequential president since LBJ or FDR
@jeffzeleny @marcorubio @ABC we don't have a right to boss Cuba just because we used to own it
@daveweigel LOL
@davidfrum don't forget the Pope brokered it...
@davidfrum love it
@MikeJonesWaPo he really needs to stop talking
@arseblognews @arseblog awesome
@JuddApatow @laughspincom who knows what is actually true? Not me. And not you.
â@ProPublica: In CA, if an adult hosts a party where minors are caught drinking, can be fined $1,000.

@mikiebarb @jaketapper @NewYorkObserver this is why you can't trust new media like blogs. Wait, what?
@daveweigel #SlatePitches
@daveweigel @NewYorkObserver what do I do with all this stock in Annacott Steel?
@mattyglesias @willwilkinson as a completely unpublished holder of an MFA from the University of Houston, I wish him luck!
@dcsportsbog RG3 wasn't injured. He always does that "long lay down" for dramatic effect.
@brianstelter @mikebarnicle did media cover Palin email hack?
@MikeJonesWaPo @JReidPost who cut Rambo? He picked off Aaron Rodgers TWICE
@MikeJonesWaPo @kentbabb ouch
@MarkHalperin price gouging is illegal
@dcsportsbog rip off Bill Simmons much?
@dcsportsbog or why they took the penalty at the end of the first half. RG3 got them to the 2; penalty put them on the 4.
@samsteinhp "13 years since 9/11 and no major attacks on the homeland" ... but torture and EIT banned for 6 years and still no attack
@arseblog when Shaquille O'Neal was unstoppable, the opposition strategy was just foul him to send him to the line to take free throws.
@arseblog are you familiar with "hack-a-Shaq" tactic from basketball?
@arseblog I would only add that the cynical fouling of Alexis has become the de facto strategy used against us. So far it is unpunished.
@JerrySeinfeld @TopFiveMovie @chrisrock saw it last night and LOVED it. 
@EricLiptonNYT @jmartNYT interest rate swaps and commodities hedging are not "risky investments"
@EricLiptonNYT @jmartNYT Listen to representative Moran from Va.
@EricLiptonNYT @jmartNYT also resonated with common sense
@chrisrock @rosariodawson we LOVED Top5!
5. Snoop Dogg
4. Biggie Smalls
3. Run DMC
2. Beastie Boys
1. Big Daddy Kane 
@MenInBlazers best strike force in the league
@chrisrock saw it last night. Fabulous!
@MeredithFrost @ravisomaiya sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar eats you
@BillSimmons my buddy was in a law firm bathroom when Snyder came in on his cellphone and fired someone while taking a crap
@pattonoswalt I have a copy if you want it
@MikeJonesWaPo love it
@MikeJonesWaPo "confidence" is not his problem...
@dcsportsbog @redskinsfacts I think that's not a review. That's the summary
@dcsportsbog I would be willing to bet that the positive reviews on this Amazon page are fakes. look into it.
@igorbobic @daveweigel federalism FTW!!
@BillSimmons @JLester31 we was once two homies wit the same mind
@chrisrock scattered smothered and covered!
@JeffreyToobin @bgedelman @Harvard I blame HBS
@dcsportsbog legit
@BostonGlobe @MarkHalperin must have been a heck of a second OT
@daveweigel Aja by Steely Dan?
@billkeller2014 fantastic. Justice Clark's finest opinion
@ProFootballTalk more time in the booth!
@jeneps @jesseclee44 @AlPunto and Sonic Highways with Dave Grohl
@JackPittBrooke @gunnerblog is this a joke?
@JohnJHarwood Trade with the Niners - RG3 for Harbaugh and Kapaernik
@MenInBlazers Redskins radio just called the score "nil-nil" #Sportofthefuture
@DarTell @brithume @FoxNewsSunday and if racist cops, prosecutors and a rigged system send all the fathers to jail, then who is to blame?
@IngrahamAngle @brithume @Jezebel that's a complete apology from Jezebel and Anna
@IngrahamAngle @brithume @Jezebel well - 
@bencelestino @dcsportsbog "my man Colt". Says it all
@WillieGeist @SIRIUSXM backspin is my JAM
@AAllenSport @arseblog yeah but the grand jury won't indict
@daveweigel @sallykohn if the victim isn't *actually* a victim then is it still "victim-blaming"?
@ThePlumLineGS @samsteinhp already joked about that
@adamnagourney I'm old enough to remember when bloggers sneered at old media jobs while hiding their ambitions
@dcsportsbog <PILE OF POO><FIRE>
@GlennThrush @wexler is this act an unconstitutional bill of attainder?
@matt_terl @dcsportsbog valid by phone only. LOL
@daveweigel that Vox valuation is literally insane
@samsteinhp thoroughbred club. Husk is a restaurant not bar
@JReidPost we are in the Zorn zone. When does the bingo caller show up for duty?
@OfficialJLD we had the dog poop in both kids bedrooms
@dylan_fahy @gunnerblog next stop Arsenal?!
@cicgcshow @JuddApatow @MirandaSings might the best CCC episode yet!
@brithume isn't it a prejudiced generalization to say that looters were honoring Michael Brown?
@nickpwing @samsteinhp wow. "People from across the region have been asking whether Rice grew up around violence". They have?
@MikeJonesWaPo just don't let him go to the Eagles. Please.
@DraperRobert @JohnJHarwood Wilson is 6'4"
@JohnJHarwood @andysnark if McCulloch thought there was no crime then he should have declined to present to GJ
@garychun @JuddApatow @marypatflaherty the idea that young white women accusing a black man of rape wouldn't be believed in 1970s is crazy
@jheil unfollow. It's JUST too much
@chrislhayes Ed Henry reported by noting only that the report concluded that initial reports were about an attack and not response to vid
@chrislhayes pic of overcrowded house with Mexican flag and broken down car
@chrislhayes UK classism sensitivities = US racism sensitivities. Both third rail. Analogy would be pic of ethnic home
@ezraklein is it INSANE?
@dcsportsbog good riddance!
@dcsportsbog reminds me of Ricky Williams giving interviews in NO with his helmet on.
@JReidPost oooops!
@tanehisicoates I have to unfollow. Too much comix to handle
@DanDetroit2013 @adamcarolla that girl is just as American as you
@jeffzeleny @NancyPelosi @RepDuckworth no one gets to proxy vote
@jheil @darylberg @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC also Androgynous
@jheil @darylberg @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC Here Comes A Regular is my fave but I love Waitress in the Sky. Just so corny
@tanehisicoates Chicago has nice architecture but so does Houston. A great city is more than buildings.
@JoeNBC @UpshotNYT misleading politicians? Gambling in Casablanca? I'm shocked!
@pattonoswalt also - "you're entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts, and the fact is [insert opinion]"
@pattonoswalt I sat right behind former SecDef Bob Gates for that song.  And for Master of Puppets. Surreal.
@peterlattman I mean, there's zero ratings for Fox network affiliate election coverage (bc it doesn't exist)
@peterlattman doesn't this show NBC+MSNBC won the demo? And were second overall?
@richeisen my fantasy team, OBVS
@Arsenal @gunnerblog this is going to be a street fight. Need Podolski
@pattonoswalt acid flashback?
@NBCSportsSoccer too many tweets! Unfollow!

@nycjim @mikebarnicle doesn't work in NYC
@NBCSports @NBCSportsSoccer @embassydavies @rogbennett @MenInBlazers @NBCSN come for the slomo replays, stay for the Ande fishing line ads
@AHBonenberger @EmilyGould wow. Jen Pink wrote a much better essay than Ms Gould
@peterlattman she just learned me some knowledge
@JReidPost @MarkMaske Colt would have failed bc the Vikings had a whole game of tape. Griffin was clearly ready. But still not pocket passer
@wjcarter @mikebarnicle almost as many as watched USMNT v Portugal
@moshekasher excellent joke
@richeisen @SI_PeterKing @miketirico @FrankGrillo @mrtritter @AntonioBrown84 @Hasselbeck ask King about Colt's "popgun arm"
@dcsportsbog I predicted they would cover a ten point spread. Does that count?
@SI_PeterKing hahahaha - moron
@SI_PeterKing how's that "popgun arm" of Colt McCoy's look like now??
@HousefromDC 
@SportsCenter reminds me of DESEAN
@JoeNBC it's gonna be so funny when Democrats keep control of the Senate
@ProFootballTalk you mean BOOBIE??
@JamilSmith @tanehisicoates because it's moronic political posturing?
@williamfleitch there was a separate squadron in my AF basic training for the band. Any musical ability and you got put there
@ProFootballTalk of course he will. What a disaster
@ThePlumLineGS @dscc its a shame she disqualified herself
@mikebarnicle youth is NOT wasted on the young!
@richeisen @adamcarolla 5 points!!!
@NewYorker isn't this hentai not otaku?
@Rzecco 1905-1945 it was Japan
@Rzecco @wrmead @brithume Truman fired MacArthur because he was going to use atomic bombs on mainland China.
@Rzecco @wrmead @brithume Korea was occupied by the Japanese in 1945. Get a better map
@Rzecco @wrmead @brithume it was two countries before the war, so remind me what was "lost"?
@Rzecco @wrmead @brithume we lost Korea?
@jaketapper @npwcnn ridiculous
@BillSimmons WELCOME BACK
@richeisen moral victory!?
@brithume @DailyCaller riiiight, because life in the working world of corporate culture is so freewheeling and consequence-free!!
@brithume @WSJ coward
@jheil @williamfleitch @alysonfooter THIS
@ggreenwald wait, did Joe Biden get caught doing drugs? Because if not, this tweet makes no sense.
@richeisen @chrisbrockman @ChrisLaw that's a bit in Curb Your Enthusiasm
@SBNation punk
@NewYorker "profoundly unmodern, unreconstructed feeling that you still find in the South". That's not very nice
@MikeJonesWaPo gold pants are weak
@Charlie_Prince that actually sounds like a terrible idea
@JuddApatow seems very Kevin Federline-esque
@dennisyedwab @JohnJHarwood coaches coach. Players play
@jheil @SFGiants bravo to the Gigantes
@MikeJonesWaPo @JReidPost coaches coach. Players play.
@AdamKilgoreWP very nice
@dcsportsbog just leave Clip out there
@AdamKilgoreWP @NatsEnquirer @ThomasBoswellWP OH GOD who is the closer??
@Milbank more Green Lanternism. If only Obama would "engage" with his opponents and show "leadership". Such crap
@gdebenedetti I like Leitch but this piece is mega-stoopid
@williamfleitch @ericfingerhut what's the thesis of this essay? Seems to contradict itself and relies FAR too much on Wolf
@rafat @jheil looks a lot like Vox
@williamfleitch @bpolitics super stupid piece, Will. Almost meaningless
@FightinHydrant Was it over when the  Germans bombed Pearl Harbor???
@JWerthsBeard Was it over when the  Germans bombed Pearl Harbor???
@AdamKilgoreWP I see what you did there.
@adamcarolla make it stop 
@kilmeade @MarkHalperin @foxandfriends as usual, a fact-free accusation of "attack" from Fox News
@MikeWiseguy @dcsportsbog 
@TheCousinSal @BillSimmons get @adamcarolla to substitute!!
@TheCousinSal @BillSimmons #FreeSimmons need to know who to bet on. (always against your picks)
@JohnJHarwood Strasburg!!!
@pearlbullets @dcsportsbog yo Adrian!
@manonwire22 @JWerthsBeard @dcsportsbog @masnKolko @recordsANDradio @NLBeastNats @thisisdspan @IanDesmond20 stop it. NWA is not amused
@drewmagary who wants a donut?
@AP_Ken_Thomas BeyoncÃ© suite?
@DeepModemMom @politico that looks like the BeyoncÃ© suite
@JoeNBC Q is really whether to call it "jihad" or murder
@MikeJonesWaPo I was at his last game. We were impotent after he left the game.
@MikeJonesWaPo I was at the TB spit game. He walked of slowly, LIKE A BOSS
@MikeJonesWaPo #21FOREVER
@BillSimmons gee, I wish I knew your thoughts on the Jeter walkoff. Shades of WWE scripting?
@JohnJHarwood of course there was. Orders from the Commish
@dcsportsbog big question is whether Niles will ever be the same
@samsteinhp this is not news. Also, the Redskins secondary is staffed by children
@upsettingshorts @tanehisicoates like, maybe, seeing if the suspect pulls out a drivers license or a firearm?
@BillSimmons I thought the pod was our safe place. #FreeSimmons
@RobertKlemko @drewmagary I will NEVER forgive Wilbon for his stupid and racist comments
@MikeJonesWaPo riiiiiiight
@kevinlove @MenInBlazers THE ARSENAL
@chrislhayes Bosnia
@ggreenwald see front page NYTimes article "US Invokes Defense of Iraq in Saying Strikes in Syria Are Legal"
@ggreenwald once Congress demurs then he has stronger legal basis bc implied consent
@JeffYoung @jesseclee44 isn't that closely correlated with % of population that is undocumented?
@JohnJHarwood @JonahNRO and that mayor in San Diego? Or Bill Clinton???
@daveweigel used to be Enchiladas y Mas over by the highway east of campus
@Arsenal @gunnerblog thought Jack was healthy??
@jaketapper the pre-cigar era
@jaketapper fair point
@DanaBashCNN @jaketapper @JoeBiden Packwood was quite progressive in his politics. Part of what made his conduct so surprising
@ProFootballTalk there's a app for that. Seriously
@jaketapper just kill yourself first!
@adamcarolla is Coke the grape jelly of the soda selection? Every meeting I go to the Diet Coke goes first
@ThomasBoswellWP we had home field two year ago over the cardinals. Didn't matter.
@daveweigel technically it is "the battle of the Beltways" but has been shortened
@ProFootballTalk what rights? It's not a criminal court it's the NFL
@JoeNBC why aren't you talking about the Yugoslavia air campaign of late 1990s? That was a successful air campaign without ground troops!
@SI_PeterKing is Kirk cousins the answer?
@robdelaney and a 120 varieties of cheddar cheese
@MikeJonesWaPo blessing in disguise
@gunnerblog I rate his response as a 10
@MarkHalperin this might be your funniest tweets ever!
@AdamKilgoreWP didn't JZim hit a Met at Citifield in the last series?
@chucktodd our goal is not to provide "stability" but just to ensure that no threat to homeland emerges. By that measure, we have succeeded
@JeffreyGoldberg @JohnJHarwood beware foreign entanglements
@JohnJHarwood that's crass and disgusting
@masnKolko very ARod-like meaningless HR from Bryce
@AdamKilgoreWP very ARod-like meaningless HR from Bryce
@callitfootball @ravisomaiya love it! Mike telling it like it is
@ABFalecbaldwin @UofA sales? Why would anyone pay $ to see you give a speech or Q&amp;A?
@williamfleitch I remember, brother Leitch. I even got the tshirt
@williamfleitch YOURE WITH ME, LEATHER
@chrislhayes there are many many cases of DV that are one incident that, with therapy, do not repeat
@chrislhayes Your paradigm of "abusers" seems overly categorical. You could be an "abuser". Anyone could. Not a separate "other"
@GobeJeets @MikeJonesWaPo the coaches don't trust him with a real playbook. Still in diapers
@ravisomaiya isn't that a little arrogant? No recovery until the media decrees it so?
@jonathanalter extreme test prep doesn't equal a good education.
@GobeJeets @MikeJonesWaPo he was 29-37, not 27-31. 78% completion and 96 QB rating ain't good enuf to win
@GobeJeets @MikeJonesWaPo fair point but avg was 7 yard pass and zero TDs. Short passes with high % is safe and conservative
@MikeJonesWaPo at least he's being coached.  Q is does he have the ability to be an accurate pocket passer with timing right??
@ThomasBoswellWP spoke too soon!
@ggreenwald his whole argument is "because of Hitler"
@peterlattman @kevinroose no, it will be real tennis fans. Very raucous crowd.
@RapSheet @drewmagary might be his and hers initials
@ProFootballTalk did that Friday night!!!
@brithume Putin isn't Hitler and Baghdadi isn't emperor Hirohito. The analogy fails and Kagan's argument is invalid
@JohnJHarwood @morningmoneyben @stras37 or Storen
@TheNatsBlog #anyonebutsoriano
@dcsportsbog that's a clown move, bro
@samsteinhp but he doesn't care about "optics"?
@jaketapper he will be on the new show - "Better Call Saul"
@TheTweetOfGod @pattonoswalt why god why??
@viaSimonRomero @ravisomaiya @nytimes who cares?
@hhavrilesky but I liked Friendster so much.
@hhavrilesky like friendster or myspace?
@FightinHydrant everything is clicking
@JohnJHarwood excellent Curb reference
@pattonoswalt Keanu is 50. Dude.
@JohnJHarwood I think this counts as a road series win against a great team
@TheNatsBlog WHEELS LAROCHE
@ThomasBoswellWP these Nats are damn hard to kill
@AdamKilgoreWP I would have intentionally walked Adrian.
@masnKolko this could be an NLCS preview
@jaketapper misquoted
@AdamKilgoreWP we've got 'em right where we want 'em!
@ggreenwald it was short term so not "declaration of war" plus it was NATO
@ggreenwald does that apply to non-state actors, pirates, ISIS, bandits, et al.?
@arseblog a classic score line!
@chrislhayes r u familiar with the rule of 2 and a half? Life is four quadrants: family, work, friends and hobbies. Can't do more than 2.5
@adamnagourney it's amazing that they didn't earthquake proof their wineries!
@arseblognews @arseblog should have picked up Balotelli
@ravisomaiya uber !
@JReidPost Can we trade Robert to St. Louis for all those draft picks?
@chrisrock and he played Pinball from ConAir!
@HarryElephante is that a man in the left or a woman?
@samsteinhp @mattyglesias is that the lower level wait room to board Acela?
@ThomasBoswellWP I'm driving from NYC to see the Nats this weekend with my Dad. Sorry if it's a jinx
@masnKolko I remember when the Nats lost in a balk off walk off.
@tanehisicoates @FletcherChristy Jesse was the first vote I ever cast - Virginia D primary 1988. And I'm white, southern and male
@samsteinhp we used to call him The Battleship Lorenzen
@masnKolko remember #letteddywin? It was a curse that resulted in Game 5 meltdown
@NatsEnquirer WILD!!
@ThomasBoswellWP YYYYYYEEEEESSSSSS!!!!!
@masnKolko YYYYYEEEEESSSZSSSZ
@DineshDSouza @daveweigel enjoy prison?
@MarkHalperin kill them all and let God sort them out
@barryap1 @drewmagary it's the golf visor
@DylanByers @speechboy71 kill them all and let god sort them out
@ezraklein actually seems like effective trolling to generate publicity
@williamfleitch I still laugh about the Rosie O'Donnell comment
@JoeCoolMiller @JReidPost Andre had to slow down to catch it and was tackled as a result. NOT "flawless"
@JReidPost he exudes leadership and confidence doesn't he? 
@nealbrennan @ApprovalMatrix @JasonBiggs @chrisrock what r u doing with your hands?
@nealbrennan @ApprovalMatrix @JasonBiggs @chrisrock I'm on it!!
@NatsEnquirer send Taylor! He is magic
@JWerthGnome @dcsportsbog @JWerthsBeard @recordsANDradio we haven't lost since Taylor debuted ...
@esoltas @ezraklein seems like an overstatement and a misleading chart. Going from 80% to 60% isn't "death" and the chart is truncated
@nickschmidle @ravisomaiya wasn't this a Mark Wahlberg movie?
@viaSimonRomero @carr2n I fantasize about a system of cable cars or tramways connecting midtown skyscrapers with each of JFK, LGA &amp; EWR
@masnKolko CLIPPARD!
@daveweigel @swin24 @ryanjreilly he needs trucknutz to complete the picture
@i8dc if it's rainy or cold, Strasburg will get shelled. Just you watch.
@deejayndn @dcsportsbog @redskinsfacts @Redskins 
@i8dc right - so would you trust Fister or Stras?
@AdamKilgoreWP maybe he should be our closer
@i8dc "other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"
@i8dc no, point is that Strasburg is not elite right now. Can't pitch 96+ and his change up won't work. He doesn't have four pitches anymore
@i8dc yeah, and thankfully luck plays no role in baseball
@i8dc @AdamKilgoreWP riiiight. And 2nd only to Kershaw in K/9. But would you rather start him or Fister or even Roark in October?
@AdamKilgoreWP perfect weather so the San Diego native was unbeatable. He is a hothouse flower.
@AdamKilgoreWP last night, I heard a LOUD "over-rated!" chant for Harper. Must have pissed him off
@Johngcole @daveweigel FEAR THE GOATEE
@DylanByers with or without the goatee? That's the key question
@peterwallsten @gdebenedetti @edatpost @PhilipRucker now she's picking out a VP???
@AdamKilgoreWP best untuck everrrr
@cdw1410 @NatsEnquirer he caught the bunt!
@NatsEnquirer worst bunt ever
Untucked!
@masnKolko why sit our best hitter?
@brithume @KirstenPowers plus 3) there are Christian kids on our border and in our country who need food and shelter
@brithume @KirstenPowers 2 probs with ur thesis 1) there was Ukraine &amp; Gaza raging during this time &amp; 2) wise leaders think before speaking
@marcmaron @arseblog @WTFpod I remember this well. I don't think I can listen to it today
@daveweigel he's gone. Sniff.
@NatsEnquirer yes but.... Harper has denied doing it. I've watched vid and can't say for sure
@NatsEnquirer love the Nats but Strasburg and Harper hype has died
@NatsEnquirer bush league
@AdamKilgoreWP it always seems weather related. He grew up in perfect weather San Diego and can't handle heat, rain, wind etc
@DeltaAssist we got on 5566, which is leaving now. So we are actually EARLY!
@DeltaAssist hello???
@DeltaAssist our confirm # is f9b6c2
@DeltaAssist customer service line says nine hour wait?
@DeltaAssist - our flight 5550 CHS-LGA was cancelled and we've been rebooked on an earlier flight? But that flight left hours ago...
@daveweigel humblebrag
@NatsEnquirer @ErvinSantana_54 that's four so far...
@jbarro @pfeiffer44 @SarahPalinUSA no. No. A thousand times no.
@samsteinhp avocado? What kind of monster are you??!
@arseblog @gunnerblog is Zelalem the REAL DEAL??
@Slate @dcsportsbog would that lacunae make it "better"?
@Slate @dcsportsbog should we erase all trace of American Indians from our life, culture?
@Slate @dcsportsbog surely INTENT should be key here?
@Slate @dcsportsbog there is nothing cartoonish or denigrating about the Redskins name or logo. It is not intended to be insulting.
@samsteinhp @ezraklein you Zionist pig! jk
@samsteinhp now that's funny!
@ravisomaiya @MittRomney what's so wrong with it?
@WSJMoneyBeat @moorehn @Dealogic isn't a surge in IPOs correlated with a drop off? Sellers are anxious to get out before the crash
@gabrielsherman he sounds like a top shelf asshole
@JohnJHarwood all good but I want to see them beat good teams on the road. Brewers series win might qualify (if Brewers were for real)
@daveweigel @hunterw wait, her name is ZEPHYR TEACHOUT? wtf?
@ThomasBoswellWP it was a two run game and the Rockies had momentum
@AdamKilgoreWP stop it
@AdamKilgoreWP WHY?????
@arseblog what about the Arsenal's trip to visit NY and T Henry?
@ScottSAllen @dcsportsbog LOL
@ThomasBoswellWP puke. The "captain" should have sacrificed for the Yankees and moved to third
@williamfleitch @BobbyBigWheel been there, got the t-shirt
@KennyAlbert @FightinHydrant @ForTheWin puke
@JohnJHarwood only if we can beat the Swiss and the Dutch
@AdamKilgoreWP @Ken_Rosenthal Not Soriano, Fister, Strasburg or Rendon? Ridiculous
@JamesWagnerWP @AdamKilgoreWP clippard?!?
@DanBarryNYT humble brag
@samsteinhp MACS SPEED SHOP. A MUST
@AdamKilgoreWP don't say no to mama
@richeisen did you get the built in sauce rack?
@EasterbrookG the IRA would tend to disagree
@chrislhayes not after the win!
@petesouza @pfeiffer44 Mr. President - you really should visit the border while you are in Texas
@moorehn they play another match for third place.
@jandersonNYT can't wait for the third place match
@AdamKilgoreWP perfect lineup
@i8dc although the "United States" was commonly plural before the civil war
@Choire I know what that is and I REFUSE
@AdamKilgoreWP dude... it's the Rockies. Means nothing
@NewYorker @TNYJohnCassidy perhaps sacrilege to compare the Alamo to soccer but we Americans love the doomed cause, the loser, the underdog
@SportsonEarth @williamfleitch dude... Love this
@SCOTUSblog had to unfollow you
@TheNatsBlog except for when Rendon didn't cover second, leading to a Rockies score
@ThomasBoswellWP harsh column. Might have mentioned Zim's great play, Rendon's mistake not covering second and Bryce sliding feet-first
@Hasselbeck @richeisen brockman and law need the blue check mark after this
@WillieGeist @williamfleitch @BigTenNetwork don't remind me. I was on vacation and misjudged Canadian time zones. Missed the whole thing
@i8dc @FightinHydrant answer: not important
@jaketapper key question: who is "they"?
@jheil @sternbergh @Tom_Shone Heat??? Which one of these is not like the others?
@jheil @sternbergh WATERWORLD OBVIOUSLY
@jaketapper and by "Hamas" he means "random civilians, including children"
@JohnJHarwood CL champions play so much together and have such talent that it wouldn't be fair fight. Coaching is better too
@i8dc Ramos won't survive BP
@moorehn epic use of the passive voice
@anthonyweiner there is already a 1% mansion tax for sales over $1mm
@i8dc and yet it's never been more popular
@i8dc Wade has made a career of flopping to draw a foul
@i8dc happy to ignore but I'm easily trolled
@i8dc and every wide receiver who draws a pass interference call
@i8dc Dwayne Wade would disagree
@i8dc yeah, unlike every other sport!
@richeisen no flop. Clear penalty under the rules. Like a good WR drawing a PI call
@Choire it's crap!
@hhavrilesky 
@hhavrilesky I'm not denying sexism (of course) but lots of male authors are heavily criticized for ego, elitism and privilege
@hhavrilesky yeah, no one ever accused Norman Mailer of arrogance
@jheil @DaveChappelle 7/10
@NewYorker @TNYJohnCassidy England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich in 2001
@SCOTUSblog doesn't that apply in New Mexico too? And the rest of the 10th Circuit?
#flipflophooray my favorite place to wear flipflops is Coopers Beach! @oldnavy #Spon0419 #m1011
@daveweigel still funny
@arseblog Mike Tyson plays for Uruguay? Wth?
@richeisen it's the beautiful game
@richeisen the ref is supposed to add that time on but it's a mystery really
@moorehn @ravisomaiya his mom was staying with him because her house burned down on Christmas Day
@i8dc no - it was bc Veep was in both executive and legislative but also neither
@GlennThrush @VanityFair you mean LGA
@ThePlumLineGS Damn that is galactically stupid
Rt 
@i8dc to be clear, I don't know how to retweet
A classic fake flop by D Wade.  
@i8dc this needs a sarcasm font
@AdamKilgoreWP where does Harper go?
@Wonkette yeah - he knows both sides of the tracks really we'll
@chucktodd nope
@i8dc @mattyglesias good one
@i8dc @washingtonpost nope
@i8dc I've been on chrome for years
@daveweigel @foxnation throw in the Dark Phoenix series and you've got a deal.
@daveweigel @foxnation now that's funny
@dcsportsbog @RyanJKelly it's possible that is a Brooklyn Cyclones hat
@JMichaelCSN @MGortat "no homo"?
@brianjameswalsh @JohnJHarwood @whignewtons damn you Hamilton!
@brianjameswalsh @JohnJHarwood @whignewtons man on third, bottom of the 14th... Rendon? Maybe?
@BFitts21 @dcsportsbog looks like Marco Rubio
@arseblog - it's worth remembering the last time I was at the Emirates (2013 first leg v Bayern) all the fans hated Ramsey
@aaronramsey pure class
@tnyCloseRead "unladylike" is your word. Is it actually impossible to critique a woman without being sexist?
@felixsalmon @daveweigel I was taught in J school to put two spaces after a period. Looks way better.
@tackettdc @JohnJHarwood Cuomo did ok from HUD
@Choire a "co-" title share was a signal to Baquet that he wasn't next in line. He refused to eat shit and Sulz backed him
@AdamKilgoreWP I remember a Nats "balk-off" not so long ago
@metmuseum Frederic Edwin Church fans would disagree.
@NatsEnquirer @KevinFrandsen nice!
@GraceRorwick you're so right. That's totally why she wrote an essay in the New Yorker about it! Not to exploit her mother's death. No!
@RGIII @WashWizards can you draw in basketball?
@NewYorker Jesus. My mother just died but I don't crap all over everybody else's day. Suffer in silence!
@gabrielsherman you know the original is in London? And they are in LA, Miami, Berlin?
@billmaher thanks, Dennis Miller!
@NewYorker so forgive me for finding Diaz to be a massive hypocrite
@NewYorker my MFA experience as a straight white male was deadening because no one wanted to publish my stories. I wasn't "diverse" enough
@NewYorker Diaz has privilege, prestige and influence in large part because he is non-white. So this whiney essay is bullshit.
@adamcarolla care to comment? 
@GlennThrush @LauraChapin @NickKristof @ezraklein Wile E. Coyote, suuuuuper genius
@carr2n attack ships on fire, off the shoulder of Orion
@dcsportsbog all the DC fans were AT the game not watching the tube
@voxdotcom @ezraklein is it "insane"?  Seems like everything is "insane" to you
@AdamKilgoreWP 105 pitches, 9 innings, 8 strike outs, 3 hits, 1 walk and ZERO runs. Awesome stuff.
@samsteinhp @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee both Supreme Court law clerks
@brithume but only one-third support full repeal
@JohnJHarwood "it is what it is"
@JohnJHarwood "at the end of the day"
@JohnJHarwood "yeah, no"
@jandersonNYT only two?
@jandersonNYT for the ladies, I would equate it with "cocktail attire"
@joshromney @maggiepolitico @SenatorReid @MittRomney what, does he want a medal?
@JohnJHarwood @DougHeye need off-menu order like "animal style" or "4x4"
@nytimesbits @carr2n like, a month ago?
@jandersonNYT no tie required.
@WillieGeist same goes for "tampering, disabling or destroying smoke detectors" can't you just stop at "tampering"?
@sullydish - LOL. "I regret it every time someone is silenced by intimidation" Unless that someone is Alec Baldwin
@FightinHydrant - you: "you don't see teams come back down 5-0 in this league" me: thanks for reminding me of NLDS Game 5... Ack!
@pattonoswalt @clarkgregg ... on fire ... off the shoulder of Orion
@primetimereds @dcsportsbog meanwhile, no seat at MSG for less than $120
@ABFalecbaldwin Alex, and I say this as an admirer, you should avoid twitter fights
@JohnJHarwood too soon?
@anylaurie16 he got TWENTY more than my mom! #oneupper
@ThomasBoswellWP is "serious" a shot at Davey and his "fun"?
@maggiepolitico I have received four since yesterday morning
@NewYorker @TNYJohnCassidy epic fail! Majority of America opposes repeal
@NewYorker @TNYJohnCassidy wrong. A majority oppose REPEAL
@samsteinhp must have been Zach and his Two Fernd
@tejucole @sfj simplistic
@tejucole @sfj oh god how dumb are you? Obama never said Crimea was "worse" than Iraq.
@Awl I'm sure the same article could be written about Spence or Miss Katherine's School
@chucktodd MacArthur and Powell too
@daveweigel @PhilipRucker @dfwairport dang, but BWI is a long-ass bus ride
@JunkScience @brithume "seriously threaten" is not "signif threat". U r epic fail
@arseblog also our best players were injured
@arseblog - you think tactics didn't matter? Why such a high line? Why not two holding midfielders? It's away at the bridge!
@JohnJHarwood @dukebasketball nope. All fires out
@JohnJHarwood @politico @RichLowry the crucial difference is that Ryan says those things to blame and not to offer solutions.
@chrislhayes just stop it. Really
@drewmagary 234.5. It's been a looooooong winter
@daveweigel doesn't work on iPhone....
@samsteinhp they still make me laugh. Just stupid
@pattonoswalt @StephenKing obviously it's because BENGHAZI
@owillis @GhostPanther @ryanjreilly Coons made the right call. Mumia is a cop killer
@chrislhayes of course this has always been true for political appointees. Mumia is a radioactive case to get involved in
@brithume @aminterest it's really sad that you politicize foreign affairs so quickly. Isn't that supposed to stop at the waters edge?
@anylaurie16 - I'm helping my mom with hospice and have laughed long and loud at your tweets. Thank you. #hospiceislatinforhereyoudoit
@JohnJHarwood that's some funny inside baseball. #greenlantern
@RichardHaass @JohnJHarwood except that interest rates will never rise and tax revenues will increase
@metmuseum @cory_arcangel @jedahan what crap
@Charlie_Prince @ComediansClubNY great!
@lis_Smith @DannyKanner @govperry those are some Al Gore "earth tones"
VFMW @sullydish 
@NewYorker Too. Many. Tweets. Stop. It.
@NewYorker @MJSchulman written by Horace Mann grad? Conflict?
@nealbrennan how did he not mention this on the podcast???
@RGIII how about welcoming Michael Sam???
@arseblog in fairness though the free spleen replacement amateurs do a halfway decent job
@richeisen @MikeSamFootball bravo
@vulture @NYMag TEAM WOODY
@chrislhayes these aren't powerful or important positions as a career FS officer is leading those embassies. No prob.
@samsteinhp trick question. That's Romneycare
@pattonoswalt I was a big Waxie Maxie's customer in No Va in the 1980s!
@TheStalwart @nycsouthpaw this is normal procedure.
@mathewi @jyarow @carr2n not his beat
@samsteinhp John fox full panic mode
@jheil @TNCposts great writing but just asserting that it's "wrong" doesn't cut it as a valid argument
@OfficialJLD @frankrichny @Jeopardy I freakin love you
@WillieGeist - 1 minute for every year
@TheStalwart it was on par with Argo, which won Best Picture...
@ezraklein context is king?
@chucktodd TOO MANY TWEETS!
@arseblog the Little Yankee?
@nealbrennan @moshekasher I LOVED the Big Daddy Kane pod. So fuckin funny!!! Ain't No Half Stepping!
@drewmagary Michael Jackson comes to mind
@pattonoswalt seriously that is the funniest tweet EVER
@friarsclub @7BOOMERESIASON Judd Apatow!!
@brithume but he is usually histrionic for the right reason
@richeisen is this game over?
@Timodc @murphymike this version of the story makes her MORE sympathetic
@Gary_Burghoff @pattonoswalt he is a little fella
@samsteinhp still crazy, after all these years
@carr2n I'm standing right behind you
@RealBarkhad baller
@JenksCSN @dcsportsbog a vague reference to FCUK fashion brand, no doubt
@conradhackett @JohnJHarwood but where are the Persians?
@mikiebarb @maggiepolitico why do phones bother you anyway? If they are silent, why is it distracting?
@sfj @jheil @nytimes @nytkeller @AdamsLisa no, that's not what the column said. Not even close
@richeisen reminds me of Rex Ryan, just a little bit...
@drewmagary @ProFootballTalk Niners and Skins have denied this story
@jheil @BillThompsonNYC @barclayscenter smiled or laughed? Get your story straight!
@adamcarolla - this awful country - 
@murphymike @lablair they tried using private emails on these msgs. Yahoo mail
@nycjim @maggiepolitico damned them with faint praise
@thesulk too soon
@GlennThrush I believe only Prez has declassification authority
@JReidPost Last yr, I attended a Skins win ovr Ravens. Yr b4, I attended win over the Giants. This year, I attended Skins win v Chargers...
@richeisen Last yr, I attended a Skins win ovr Ravens. Yr b4, I attended win over the Giants. This year, I attended Skins win v Chargers...
@richeisen go fuck yourself, Hans
@1capplegate @JuddApatow WHAMMY! WHAMMY! WHAMMY!
@chrislhayes ONE WORD - Redskins. MNF blowout followed by SNF blowout
@DanBarryNYT the President's record on pardons and clemency is very disappointing. He lacks courage.
@JeffreyToobin @howappealing and Gregg Costa for Fifth Circuit!
@richeisen @Earth_Pics aren't you from Staten Island? That's a long way from Central Park
@jpressler @NYMag Greek Orthodox, not Jewish
@chucktodd I'm +30 with Flacco and bush on the other team
@JohnJHarwood unfollow!!! #jerk #spoiler
@ABFalecbaldwin you should do "Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell" yourself.
@chrislhayes @megynkelly - we live in Midtown East and will be leaving town this weekend. My 5 year old shouldn't see this crap
@masnKolko sounds like a micromanager nitnoid who won't be flexible when the pressure is on. No instincts
@NewYorker @eosnos @SenGillibrand - is she still pro gun and anti immigrant like when she was in the House?
@richeisen I spent it watching the Spiderman musical with my son. #redskinspride
@richeisen @dpshow @RonBurgundy I bet you can't work "Odin's beard" into the conversation
@exjon @brithume but whatever
@exjon @brithume and no one is celebrating
@exjon @brithume it doesn't end sanctions
@richeisen all Welker's fault
@jheil @SamSifton @nytimes brilliant and incisive. Just like everything TNC writes...
@colinwilhelm @dcsportsbog redemption bar or Dorians Red Hand. Both on second ave
@nealbrennan very funny
@ABFalecbaldwin @UpLateWithAlec @msnbc  - I hope you return to the air
@Awl Aloo Saag is way better
@adamnagourney uh, the last presidents second term was pretty bad?
@chrislhayes I would HIGHLIGHT that the mom's company was linked in the article. The NYT not only gave publicity but free advertising
@daveweigel Jane Lynch and Amy Poehler. That is all.
@jmartNYT @maggiepolitico maybe because he is unelectable in the R primaries?
@richeisen or not
@moshekasher great news dude. Is Neal going to contribute?
@ThomasBoswellWP HAHA, I remember beating the Cards 8-0 in an elimination game. That was so much fun!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA (Gunshot, then silence)
@jheil HAHA, I remember when we were beating the Cards 8-0 in an elimination game. That was so much fun!!! HAHAHA (Gunshot, then silence)
@ThomasBoswellWP no
@ABFalecbaldwin - how about donating to support mothers and children in Tanzania? Go to 
@daveweigel - "kayak" (from a conference call yesterday, when I referred to "those plastic canoes for one?"
@mollyesque @maggiepolitico is she still pro-gun and anti-immigrant like she was when she represented an upstate district? LOL
@JohnJHarwood @katephillips @lisatozzi @ryanpbroderick - sometimes a breakdown is a breakthrough
@MikeWiseguy - for once, you were right!!
@ezraklein - you might mention the CEO's recent note about divesting non-core businesses.
@carr2n so basically the Daily Beast? Good luck with thay
@dap1510 @brithume this is laughable, simpleminded lunacy.
@dcsportsbog me
@DRUDGE_REPORT @joanwalsh they make a mockery of themselves.
@jonathanweisman he must have meant executive, judiciary, Senate and House
@richeisen @MikeSilver how about Kirk Cousins for Josh Gordon?
@Choire 5
@drewmagary - of course, it's a BMW ... 
@brithume Salon editor, not Slate columnist. But whatever. Facts don't matter inside the Republican bubble
@NatGeopix UNFOLLOW
@RealTattoos @NatGeopix - UNFOLLOW
@emilynussbaum Jeremy Piven would be even better
@TheFix @ThePlumLineGS has to be using a bleacher buddy
@abbydphillip @maggiepolitico @mnitzky @deBlasioNYC @BarackObama - oh, to be a fly on the wall!
@sullydish maybe he's just lucky? Like when he ran against Alan Keyes? Or when he got grumpy old man in 2008 and Richie Rich in 2012?
@dcsportsbog which is a point so manifestly and obviously stupid I didn't even click on it
@wconnors @mikeallen @MarkMaremont - and... BB CEO will get millions when the company is sold
@samsteinhp why is this on the FRONT PAGE??
@barrysvrluga @dcsportsbog how do you this is the last home game???
@KeithOlbermann - you tweet too much spam. Four tweets in a row? Many of them repeated?
@samsteinhp don't feed the troll
@DavidChalian @wjcarter @richeisen  would be perfect
@billburton @TheJeffBridges @TheFix - sometimes ya eat the bear. Sometimes the bear eats you
@masnKolko @JamesWagnerWP @AdamKilgoreWP - c'mon guys, try being original. 
@EricBoehlert @jonfavs @politico  - just trolling
@MikeWiseguy I started RGIII and it turned out great
@carr2n @RiotFest - children by the millions weep ...
@richeisen and how many uncalled OPI penalties?
@carr2n is that with or without Paul Westerburg???
@brettessler @carr2n @nytimes @BicyclingMag - I would pay for that!
@joanwalsh @allinwithchris voted to give Pres the authority to go in but disagreed with the eventual decision to exercise that authority.
@JamesWagnerWP @AdamKilgoreWP @masnKolko - does that explain posting the same random stats at the same time? Not play by play
@JamesWagnerWP @AdamKilgoreWP @masnKolko - why do you all post the same thing at the same time?
@KeithOlbermann @NewYorker - nice LLCoolJ reference
@masnKolko @MikeWiseguy @JamesWagnerWP @AdamKilgoreWP @ThomasBoswellWP - any of you guys know who is on the list for Nats manager? Too soon?
@chrislhayes factually wrong
@NatGeopix where? We are going next week to Naples, Rome and Florence
@JohnJHarwood - wasn't his memoir The Fat Man in the Bathtub?
@dcsportsbog @Brian_Tinsman so that translates as "The Princes of Nice". Possible new name for Redskins?
@mattyglesias @daveweigel I used to hate Skyler but now I see her logic, pride and hubris.
@masnKolko what does that mean?
@adamcarolla - worth a read - 
@AdamKilgoreWP quote from the movie Red Tails
@murphymike "maniac hot head" - sounds like a prerequisite for NYC mayor
@AdamKilgoreWP yeah riiiiight
@JamesWagnerWP yeah right
@JohnJHarwood @LukeRussert BOOM
@dcsportsbog - lifelong fan here. Family season tickets go back to Griffith Stadium. I say change the name to Redtails.
@AdamKilgoreWP if only!!!
@masnKolko cut the bum!
@chucktodd @dailyrundown Obama economic reset speeches are like stories about the Nats turning the corner
@MikeWiseguy @MarkKriegel THERE ARE NO GREAT FOOTBALL MOVIES
@JohnJHarwood @GlennThrush @jimgeraghty but Founders established the Senate with 13 states of relatively equal size...
@joanwalsh - blarney castle and the midleton very rare whiskey distillery
@adamcarolla - at coffee shop, asked for iced americano with extra shot. Guy says "triple shot?" Almost said "that's my gay porn name"
@samsteinhp I see what you did there.
@PE_Feeds - no Mormon mention? Huntsman and Bain Capital are huge Mormon family businesses
@ThomasBoswellWP - Because Davey is an idiot "tough guy"? And his team thinks their shit don't stink?
@ThomasBoswellWP - sad to say but I think it is time for Davey to go.
@adamcarolla I need points on the gross before I fund ANYTHING
@adamcarolla I want gross points  or else no cash from me!!!
@NYMag it's just calimocho or kalimoxo
@AdamKilgoreWP - safe as safe can be.
@ThePlumLineGS isn't this about votes? No citizen = no votes. GOP must depress D vote count at all costs and denying CIR does that?
@pattonoswalt SUPER SUPER SUPERMARKET!
@megangarber @maggiepolitico WHO CARES. PEOPLE ARE DEAD
@GeraldFSeib @JohnJHarwood @WSJ - Q is whether we *should* have any influence anywhere.
@masnKolko - NYC resident Nats fan here. I was at the game in full Nats gear and got no guff from the Mets fans. #beatendown
@AdamKilgoreWP - I STILL DON'T TRUST DREW!
@sullydish - oh, get off the high horse. He was pissed and threatened some guy.  Not bc he is gay but bc he trashed AB's very pregnant wife
@MikeWiseguy - and joe Montana in KC!
@DArkMEATHOOK @MikeWiseguy - my cynical guess is that Davey is conceding Friday's game. Watch to see if Ryan Z starts
@DArkMEATHOOK @MikeWiseguy - Det goes tomorrow
@JohnJHarwood - my kid still talks about the double decker carousel there.
@mindykaling - I'm on the board of US charity  @KuponaFdn which supports maternal health in @tanzania
@lexinyt @PE_Feeds @NYTmag CRONUTS
@metmuseum - 10-11am or 10-12 noon - you think strollers could be allowed? Plenty of room...
@metmuseum - we go at 10am so it's empty. Can't you have family hours? Geez it was frustrating today. I pay members fee for what??
@metmuseum - sucked to bring my kids to the Met today. No strollers allowed: Punk exhibit, rooftop, members dining and Civil War photo show
@toddzwillich @maggiepolitico and JIM Belushi
@MikeWiseguy - it does imply some level of rationality
@MikeWiseguy - you asked for reasoned argument for keeping the name. I said "they own it". Truth.
@MikeWiseguy - i'm happy if the market decides and not you or me. And as a USAF vet, I like Red Tails as the new name
@MikeWiseguy - but I didn't say it honored them. I don't know if it does or not. But the name is Snyder's property and you have no say
@MikeWiseguy - Try again. Snyder is the owner of "Redskin" so what gives you the right to tell someone else what to do with their property?
@MikeWiseguy - Harjo sued Pro-Football, Inc., not NFL
@MikeWiseguy - wrong. Snyder owns Pro-Football, Inc, which is trademark registrant on 
@MikeWiseguy - how about it is property of another person and you have no right to tell the team to throw it away? They OWN the name, right?
@JuddApatow - it's NOT wiretapping. Just metadata of call times, phone #s, location data. Not private info and not content of calls
@williamfleitch - ^dick joke
@adamcarolla - Deacon Jones, RIP. did you know he kicked an extra point in his last regular season game? Banked it off the pole as a Redskin
@MikeWiseguy @RGIII - the fact that Robert never returned McNabb's call makes me respect him more.  #onceaneaglealwaysaneagle
@jeffzeleny @jimrutenberg - Georgica Beach...
@jeffzeleny @jimrutenberg - uhhhh, where?!
@masnKolko - just like old times!
@adrian_gray - aaaand with that last misleading stat, I unfollow you. Buh bye
@PE_Feeds its a small town in many ways
@PE_Feeds - NE corner, 11am to 12:30. three adults and four kids. Tossing a football around with my 5 yo
@PE_Feeds - this was the view of Sheeps Meadow today at 11am. #earlybird 
@RGIII his name is lebron
@Peggynoonannyc - that's quite a gauzy web you weave  there.
@chrislhayes @samsteinhp - so does IRS scandal finally put to bed the fiction that "the Tea Party had R members and D members"??
@JuddApatow - I am flying over international waters, watching This is 40 and tweeting you. #laughingtooloudinbusinessclass
@richeisen - NOBODY beats the Van Wyck. (Seinfeld)
@jheil @Morning_Joe @MorningMusiQ - children by the millions weep for Alex Chilton
@BillSimmons @ESPNStatsInfo - and there are still guys arguing for Greg Odom
@RyanCareyDC @dcsportsbog @Nationals - must be a Walgreens fan...
@Interior - Arcadia NP in Maine!
@TPM - is that Abe Froman, the "Sausage King of Chicago"?
@nkulish - yes, you were right. I was wrong. Queue up a thousand anti-German jokes on the covers of London tabloids!
@ThomasBoswellWP - different ranking among that four, I assume?
@adrian_gray - who are his readers? Voters who support winning candidates?
@dcsportsbog love this
*&gt;&gt;&gt;^^[_?â¬{!=}~~.
@masnKolko aaaand a four pitch walk to lead off
@carr2n @brianstelter maritime Hotel?
@adrian_gray - this is classic Bush admin deception. Cherry pick data and dress it up as proof.
@masnKolko - why no Lombo???
@dcsportsbog - Trent Williams?
@masnKolko - THROW A STRIKE DREW! JUST ONE FREAKING STRIKE! #flashback
@JohnJHarwood needs a #sarcasm hashtag
@brithume @jeffraykovich @kirstenpowers10 - NYPost never covered the story so are they liberal MSM??
@MichaelPaulson @tabletmag @nytmag what is "trayf"?
@richeisen @umichbball - "one of"??? What else?
@samsteinhp yeah, whatever, it didn't make a diff. #zona
@JohnJHarwood @glennthrush @theplumlinegs @jpodhoretz @maggiepolitico - Brooklyn is IN Long Island, so it's a joke
@allinwithchris @stevekornacki - OBVIOUSLY a full bar
@ABFalecbaldwin - she gets it done. TCB, just like Elvis
@ABFalecbaldwin - isn't an article like this sexist? Similar behavior by a male politician is not reported like this.
@adamliptak - proud DC tradition. I once paid a guy for free tickets to a big museum show. He had a crew of linestanders working for him.
@dcsportsbog - RGIII looks good but boy has Ngata put on some weight
@masnKolko - has he spoken with John Lannan? He has no regrets
@JuddApatow @bwodders - how about a Fresca?!
@JuddApatow @bwodders - you'll get nothing and like it!
@JLin7 - now you get my Arizona Wildcats! Prepare to meet defeat!
@Choire - oh, stop whining
@chucktodd @edatpost @benpershing - I have always suggested "Goldskins" or just "Skins"
@ABFalecbaldwin - I think COMPETENCE is the first criteria for NYC mayor. She is the most competent so she is the best
@ezraklein - the image doesn't appear on safari on iPhone. Kind of clunky and awkward, the wapo website is
@AriFleischer - FUCK YOU ARI YOU LYING PIECE OF SPIT
@williamfleitch @chrismohney - I just watched a tongue tattoo
@UOJim - Don't you need to prove malicious intent by coalition to say "evil"? And isn't the result today better for the Iraqi people?
@AriFleischer - but the Prez changed from full support for equal rights in the form of civil unions 2 full support in the form of marriage
@richeisen @gregjennings - Redskins?
@fivethirtyeight - Virgin is very nice. Get the economy seats upstairs on the 747s
@nycsouthpaw - cops were plain clothes too, so self defense?
@adrian_gray - what rumors??
@chrislhayes - correct. 14th amendment says "person" not citizen...
@adamcarolla - on a European flight recently. They just said "tampering" with the smoke alarm. #babysteps
@JohnJHarwood - but at the end of the day, they raised taxes and cut spending. Yes?
@Choire - your subconscious must want this: 
@SaraLibby @vpsteezy - SAMOAS. END OF DISCUSSION
@craigsla - Adrian is a strong name
@robreich - I'm literally shedding a tear for Dworkin. Decency incarnate
@Dameshek @adamcarolla - just downloaded it and set my DVR to record the 1984 version.
@drewmagary - worse than magilla gorilla?
@adamnagourney - hed is "Millionaires Consider Leaving California..." ? I'm sorry if that's picky
@adamnagourney - your story doesn't actually report on anyone leaving the state bc of high taxes, so the headline is false
@ezraklein @dorseyshaw - Rubio doesn't exactly say anything incisive or even very thought provoking about rap music.
@moshekasher - CHAPPELLE!!!???
@samsteinhp - Sir Charles
@sullydish - doesn't it follow then that this talent will be lost in future generations that do not need to obscure or hide gayness?
@adamnagourney @jeffzeleny - "as his window BEGINS to close"? Is it already closing? #dangthatwasfast
@richeisen - on MorningJoe, @mikebarnicle just did a sweet walk and talk w Terry Francona. Have you ever done a walk and talk WITH another?
@ezraklein @dylanmatt - true or false: the peaceful transition of power from Washington was 1st in human history not related by blood?
@ColinBarnicle - they don't fund research!

@thesulk - those were his DAD's dog tags, weren't they?
@samsteinhp I like "arms control"
@brithume - Powell has earned the right to offer a little "tough love" to the GOP. If he can't critique, who can?
@brithume - no, condescension wouldn't fit in my tweet. Intolerance and condescension are different/distinct from racism, IMHO
@brithume - Saying that parts of the GOP are intolerant isn't the same as saying that they are racist. Words have meanings.
@brithume - but of course he never said that
@brithume - so what? Does Powell owe the Republican Party something because of that?
@adamcarolla - Huell Howzer is dead. I demand a long podcast parody
@dcsportsbog - somewhere, Rizzo is sadly smiling and nodding his head. "THAT is why I sat Strasburg"

@dcsportsbog - I predicted a 6-10 season with TOTAL confidence
@ezraklein - I just cancelled my Zipcar membership
@nealbrennan - 
@adamcarolla - thinking of a move to LA.  Job in Culver City. Where should I live? (with wife and two kids). Santa Monica? Manhattan Beach?
@HousefromDC - this is the funniest tweet of 2012. Love it.
@adamcarolla Scooby Doo.
@richeisen @bradheisler  - I always thought boat races went back and forth.
@richeisen - how can I find out in advance which games are on NFLN Replay? I was at FedEx yesterday and want to see my skins win again
@murphymike - isn't he gay?
@piersmorgan - I remember when T Henry was too proud to dive. He learned to dive and Arsenal touched perfection partly as a result
@chucktodd - without a doubt, Nikki Haley is trying to think of a way to appoint herself

âSo the timing is great,â Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said of the annou... ht ...

@mikebarnicle - DR NO DR NO DR NO DR NO!! All time best.
@ChelseaVPeretti - how many ADRIANS???
@AriFleischer - but not blindly, right? Is it ok to note that both sides have legit positions and both can be condemned for their excesses?
@ezraklein - but if you make $1mm...
@sportsguy33 - jinx?
@ChelseaVPeretti - my 4 year old saw that and said "that dancing is GROSS"
@brithume ABSOLUTELY
@ezraklein - remember when Bush claimed a mandate in 2004 to privatize Social Security?
@samsteinhp - is the CW now that Romney "failed to close the deal"?
@MarkHalperin - is the CW in the Gang of 500 that Romney has "failed to close the deal"?
@JohnJHarwood - is the CW that Romney has "failed to close"?
@chrislhayes - just wait until your child uses language to cut you to the core.
@carr2n - I'm in manhattan and I found out most new news from twitter first.
@michaelluo - I see the subways are down, but why are the buses going to be out?
@murphymike @jdgponca - except when he is at 49%? 
@adrian_gray - Obama 49, Romney 48 does not mean TIED. It shows a three point swing to Obama! Talk about cherry picking!
@samsteinhp - let's compare his rookie season to Eli's, shall we?
@ThomasBoswellWP - remember this? 
@jack  - remember this? 
@alexcast @murphymike - Gallaghers isn't closing. It's being sold to the guy who runs the Boathouse
@murphymike - our Navy had 245 ships in 1916 and 285 now. Low point was Bush Admin 278 ships in 207. So, Romney was wrong
@JohnJHarwood - as a Nats fan, I think the only consolation is if the Cardinals go on to win it all
@SamSifton HILARIOUS. EU AS NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS
@SarahKogod @dcsportsbog @lindsapple - NYC apartment #HTTR #Natitude Santana TD on the L and Suzuki RBI on the R! 
@SaraLibby - all these stories make him sound like a cheap guy. #mrburnswascheaptoo
@williamfleitch @cklosterman - TLDNR
@murphymike - at what point does R superpac $ stay on sideline or move toward House/Sen races? Lost cause is a bad investment
@adamcarolla - SPOTTED in NYC. Vero wine bar on Second Ave, selling Mangria! 
@michaelluo - you mean Ca$hley, don't you? #sellout #judas
@williamfleitch - CHEEZ DOODLES ARE DELICIOUS AND DELECTABLE
#MuslimRage - great hummus but nothing to dip into it except pork rinds
@murphymike - this is not news. Just annual exercise
@chrislhayes - I need a GIF of you rolling your eyes, looking skyward and furiously tapping your fingers on Bill Maher's show.
@nealbrennan - because an ambassador speaks for the USA and his death is a result of an attack on a non-combatant. Like a mob hit on a wife
@nealbrennan - I was disappointed that your Aziz pod didn't get into the racial politics of his comedy. He is a trailblazer as Asian comic
@richeisen - Luther on BBC with Idris.
@samsteinhp - and REM song "Orange Crush" too. #oldBroncosnickname
@dcsportsbog - FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IT ISN'T THE BELTWAY SERIES!! (beltway doesn't go to Baltimore)
@AriFleischer - Ryan claimed "2 hours 50 something" and NOT a 3 hour marathon. That is absurd exaggeration.
@chrislhayes - I am SO DISAPPOINTED in the tie and three-piece suit. Full stop,
@jeffzeleny - all this announcement needs is a MISSION ACCOMPLISHED banner
I just got up to 8,825 in #DoodleJump!!! Beat that!Nathan 

@dcsportsbog - last night at citifield, Nats players seemed to imitate Harper in batters box. Zim looked at his bat. Shark too. Coincidence?
@chrislhayes - oops. on early morning coffee run, I thought "can't wait to see what Chris Hayes says about Sct" #notsaturdaymorning #uppers
@louisck - what is the best joke you have never told?
@samsteinhp - your question to Ron Paul about his accepting SS benefits = BOOM!
@adamcarolla - I'm two blocks from your NYC book signing but as an homage to your lazy family won't make the trip. #neverwenttoasinglegame

@masnKolko why not more buzz around T Moore? Kid is hot tonight
@Kimsfirst @edgery so how can Dems control when Rs have a veto on EVERYTHING?
@Kimsfirst - not with filibuster abuse. Need 60 votes to go to the bathroom
@adamcarolla - Iced Tea Hall of Shame: passion fruit-hibiscus flavor is only option at Sag Harbor NY cafe. HIBISCUS?
Very nice - 

@WillieGeist1 - been there, brother. What's so wrong with a frosty and chili for dinner???
HST on the Derby 
@ezraklein @jamesfallows - Carter MADE THAT CALL! That's is what Romney got so wrong. Desert One was even higher risk than OBL raid
@JoeNBC @politico - problem with Romney dissing Carter is that Carter MADE THAT CALL. It's not like he sat on his hands!
@ThomasBoswellWP - was that first K for Harper? They should save that ball too
@ezraklein - as a native Washingtonian, I have sworn eternal vigilance against any attempt to dominate the DC skyline
@samsteinhp - UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK

@pattonoswalt - early Van Halen
@pattonoswalt - In The City by the Jam
@samsteinhp - outdoor shower is one of those rich man/poor man things, like owning a boat
@jandersonNYT - neither was mine.
@jandersonNYT @naomiwolf - most private schools are more intense and competitive than public schools, so this essay makes no sense.

@chappelledavidk - YOU HAVE BEEN MISSED DUDE!
@jheil - so the guy from Office Space prepped Sarah Palin in 2008?
@WhitneyCummings did you run track?
Matthew.s                       
@pattonoswalt I'm still waiting for my eyes to burn out in splendor and awe.


@mattyglesias - I live in manhattan and the commuters dominate on street parking. It's free and don't pay tolls to come from outer broughs
@jheil nothing like a libertarian threatening an age discrimination lawsuit.
@samsteinhp what in the world did Bob Dole mean by referring to Newt's empty ice bucket?
@mattyglesias only one solution to Iowa: DO-OVER!!  Somebody call Bachmann!
@ezraklein only one solution to Iowa: DO-OVER!!
This makes me want to run through a brick wall 
@jheil why is no one seeing the Romney-Santorum ticket? Mitt gets his conservative credentials shored up and Rick gets a job?
@richeisen @joshmcginn @theeisenpodcast the kids say Bud for Bud Light and "Bud Heavy" for Bud
@louisck - as a Dad I have to inform you that you are my hero
@richeisen mad respect for the Omar Little shout out. RIP

@adamcarolla love plantains
The fact that no sports outlet has breathlessly reported a massive Redskins free agent is actually a refreshing change!
@adamcarolla - just clicked through ur site to buy on amazon the following: TV, DVD, steamer, swingset, kids sand table and kids water table
@samsonthepug - PRESENTED WITHOUT COMMENT

Happy New Year!!!
