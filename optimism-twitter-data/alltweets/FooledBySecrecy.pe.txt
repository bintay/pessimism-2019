@hyper_chondriac i though it's something matt would totally watch. :D
@hyper_chondriac haha i can imagine! i just saw an ad for the show earlier today, seems interesting! but creepy as hell.
@hyper_chondriac i think it's a promo for the new tv series 'humans'
@GypsyJaeger i usually do it the other way round when eating cakes, try to leave the frosting last :D
@GypsyJaeger i think i would be fine with just the frosting tbh... ::D
at the risk of the feeling not being too mutual, i miss you all.&lt;3
especially after psycho tour queues and not being so afraid to communicate with people as i was before, those were the nicest queues ever!
waaahhh seeing everyones fb posts about nyc gigs and stuff makes me almost more jelly of musers just hanging out and being tourists together
@GypsyJaeger i think this might be the thing i'm gonna try to bake next...
@lastsmindy jos tykkäät starlightista ja ooot aina halunnu sille jatko-osan niin ehkä piristää :D muuten en tiiä...
@GypsyJaeger holy shit O____________O
.......people are seriously butthurt about mercy leaking??? of course someone was going to sneak a recording device in jfc.
@lastsmindy samoin.&lt;3
not even the usual sad/hopeless/anxious way but just kind of trapped and i hate it.
man do i feel like shit
i'm starting to think those were actually really golden times when i was young and lived at home and my parents restricted my internet use.
no way i've seen it twice.
futurism
i want more yes please and agitated for the summer fests.
holy shit dat execution commentary riff from nyc! when was the last time they played that?? 2008?
*balance
in 2010 my  oyster card would have been worth 2 bus journeys.
could have gone ~socialising~ today but looollll no money to travel.
now what. where could i find inspiration to do something.
sorry about the rant but this is hitting so close to home.
i'm sure wrong hair colour is upsetting but things shouldn't be taken out of proportion (I never do that of course!!!1) but srsly.
when a depressed person refers to killing themselves it's a cry of help and needs to be taken seriously,
but i'd be cautious using that sort of expression/status/emoji thing/whatever. if youre not actually suicidal.
i mean OKAY if you're depressed enough a little thing like that CAN trigger suicidal feelings, for sure.
*massive cringing and shuddering* 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac the only thing i ever liked about it was chris switching so fast from one neck to the other on the kitara.
all this muse is making my brain hurt. time for some new orphan black.
@hyper_chondriac omg we should do that :DDD and inspire a track on the next album!
@Racket indeed. i never really like photoblab tho. but yeah.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac smbh too, but i must be the only person or one of the very few who doesn't like it live. o_O
@hyper_chondriac a bit more light-hearted ::::D
@hyper_chondriac same
@Racket 
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME except feeling good :D
@Racket FAWY
i just realised there is a good muse song about feelings n shit in major key but it's never been played live.
@hyper_chondriac haha same. knights has been the only song so far to reach that sort of level of ridiculous epicness imo.
19 days until muse whyyyyy how aadjhhjf
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME aahhhhh i wanna hear a studio version already!! although it'll probably be less grand than live but hey.
i wish i had cake.
@monsieurbellamy @hyper_chondriac i'm counting on at least aftermath being another chunk of cheese.
man how i love me some good old light-hearted muse bashing. :')
@Racket oh god, wouldn't be surprised. and he'd sing about undisclosed ~drones~. =)
surely i don't listen to my music that loud???? sometimes i wish i lived by myself.
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME something heavy as fuck like space dementia and apocalypse! and the middle bit of hoodoo.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac true dat. it's like classic rock + RATM which turned out to be a very good combo!
@Racket maybe they were brainwashed by evil corporate droans, they should go back on mushrooms!!1 :/ lel.
@Racket and UD. and such things. instead of MK ultra for example. (i'll never get over the stadium tour it seems.)
@hyper_chondriac i know! buuuut i want to believe the globalist will be epic, it does sound so judging by the clips!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac that's what i'm kind of worried about. :|
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac @maja1985 @Racket guiding drones
@Racket not by muse logic tho. =)
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @Racket OUR DRONES WILL BE FOREVER!!1
@hyper_chondriac well i hope that wasn't just a load of bollocks! what we have now is continuation of starlight and madness/UD... ::D
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @Racket i'm sorry this is the only thing i'm relatively good at.
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @Racket i need your droooooooooooooonnnnnnneeeeessssssssssss
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @hyper_chondriac @Racket destroy the droneless!!!
@maja1985 @hyper_chondriac @Racket growing like a new drone!
fucking excellent :D:D:D #lastRT
@hyper_chondriac maybe the past means bhar era :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME they should listen to no more u2 at all.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME haha. i like depehce mode, u2 have a couple of good songs but not too keen on them tbh, especially as muse's influence lol.
@hyper_chondriac well as this is muse i suppose it's just best to be sceptical indeed and keep expectations as low as possible :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME haha well tbh i don't know u2 that well ::D i just negatively associate them with easy access major key music.
but hey i'm mentally very immature. =)
everyone has a child these days. as in people i went to school with. i must be the only one who doesn't????
@hyper_chondriac but yeah i assume globalist at least will be good, as well as the other one in that making of vid, can't remember the title
@hyper_chondriac i'm STILL upset about them butchering assassin&amp;exo on the album :D but at least the former still works live...&lt;3&lt;3&lt;33
FUCKS SAKE BOTS STOP FOLLOWING ME!!!!!
also damn i want a physical copy of psycho/dead inside, hope they're not limited or anything i'm gonna have to wait until payday. :(
but if it ends up being 50/50 it still kicks the asses of the 3 previous albums :::D
my expectations of this album are a little more cautious again, so far i only really like 2 of the 4 songs i've heard...
but maybe it will grow on me. maybe it'll be good live.
muse and major key just don't work together. :( if it was in minor i'd probably like it more.
i was hoping u2 influences would be gone
in ideal world they would drop starlight and just play mercy, something about the thought of them both in a setlist makes me uncomfortable
okay...
erm
..I want it that way"

#londonprotest 
wow today has been a waste of everything.
get your propaganda elsewhere fb
excuse me?! 
googlin hypoallergenic cat breeds
in other news, jesus christ i want a cat so bad. ;_____________;
man i kinda want to join the protest but can't really afford any extra bus journeys to central london. #ToriesOutNow
everytime someone asks dom what's his favourite song on the new album he says something different.
so if they're going to play like they've never played before on the actual tour i'm pretty sure it IS going to be the 360 stage.... meh.
@musclexmuseum it was on tv in finland as well! :D we actually had a lot of eastern/central european kids programmes now that i think of it.
soooo the thing tonight lasts only an hour??? i don't suppose they're gonna play the full album then... if there's q&amp;a and other stuff. ???
@musclexmuseum yeah prague def has the best souvenir stuff! :D windows full of little mole and friends.&lt;3 :D
i should drink green tea more often it's not as bad as i always assume it is. bad as in taste, i suppose in general it's good for everything
tea is almost gone already. D: whaht do i do with my life now.
@musclexmuseum i got a little plush toy mole as well! although i could have probably bought pretty much everything from that shop... :D
@musclexmuseum it's my souvenir from prague! :')
i made some tea so i'll have something to do once it's lukewarm enough to drink. 
who's walking on my roof?!
4 days ago?!?!! blimey. that was the day when i even got some sewing done. why do those days happen like once a month (if i'm lucky)???
i don't even remember when was the last time i listened to music??? other than when walking to work and back. but at home.
i really need to get my shit together regards how i'm spending my time at home, this is certainly not helpful. :/
so that was my only saturday off in ages. i got up at 8 already because the headache wouldn't let me sleep and i've done nothing since.
aah beautiful. :') #lastRT
@delilah_1982 yeah and they have to actually watch the thing with their own eyes instead through a phone/camera screen.


"I know, David, I know," replied Mr Murdoch.
will the people at the iheartradio thing be able to concentrate on the gig or whatever at all when they have to give up their smart devices.
anyway lucky bastards whoever are in. still a fucking MONTH until it actually comes out. ;__________;
so what's the deal with tonights gig then? are they performing the album live or just playing studio versions etc??
6 followers in one day i think 5 of them are bots.
(yes yes i am very late to the party with this RS interview.)
so would that be the showbiz reference, controlling my feelings and so on and so on.
"Midway through 'The Handler,' in the darkest places, the protagonist .....  feels this desire to actually feel something"
"I could take up smoking."
"You damn well better." htt…
and still they did the whole of T2L live (except that u2 song)
"As I look back at the last three albums, each one had progressively less and less songs that we could play live."
seems it doesn't matter who lives in the room next to mine, they are always gonna be listening to some sort of acid rave.
@musclexmuseum yeah exactly.
@musclexmuseum yeah so i heard :D well except for that high stick non-goal.
man that russia game would be an interesting one to watch but i'm gonna be in Q.I. that evening too bad.
@musclexmuseum hehe thanks :D i don't even know who our goalies are this year, never even heard of the guy today but fuck he was amazing.
how do these kids do things and i'm just hanging out with my laptop.
bloody hell that finland goalie is good! 0___0 and like 10yrs younger than me...
fun finland fact: in the end the only thing that matters (in sports or anything) is to do better than sweden.
wtf finland breaking some record held by sweden?! excellent.
aaaaaaannnnd another one!!! that was beautiful. :')
finally a goal! :D go finlaaaaaaannnd!
miksi tuolla pelikatkolla soi teräsbetonia :DDD
fucking hell, scoreless after 40 minutes! goaies are pretty good tho.
my stream is so crap i don't even know where the puck goes
i nearly panicked there for a second
looooll
again there's some strange sounding name that's probably something completely normal in finnish.
@musclexmuseum fingers crossed!
they pronounced it so weird.
gotta love how the canadians pronounce finnish names. :') last year i didn't even realise one of the players was called hytönen.
@musclexmuseum thanks i hope so too :D
does any hockey player ever find the crowd annoying, like shuddup i'm trying to play!!1
man that crowd is loud.
hmmmm finland vs slovakia hockey game starting now i believe should i find a stream hmmm
this useless monologue is over for a bit now i'm going. im behaving like i have an audience.
i wish i had blueberries tho. ;________________;
how about i tried to bake my own cheesecake
i wonder if i'm going to buy yet another £1 cheesecake and then feel guilty. not because of the cake but the pound i'm wasting.
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 you were in the front right? from what i heard i thought the crowd was pretty good...
but i'm hungry.
what if i just lay here for the rest of the day.
i put my shoes on and everything ready to go to supermarket and i just came here to check my bank account balance and now i want to cry.
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 ahh, the bastard
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 i had that 50th gig sign and chris saw that and threw the picks but they went on the groung lol
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 quite possible, picks and setlists and whatnot always seem to go to the person(s) next to me :D but in werchter
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 haha cool. i guess that's where we all want to be one day..
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 sweet. did you ask him :D or did he just go "hey it's you!" i *nearly* got a chris pick once too! i wish as well.
@CarolinaMillan @maja1985 yeah i know but i'm not complaining i they ditch it. :p and yeah i saw some of you with matt and dom.
oh god i want chocolate.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME indeed. i can understand it was played on TR tour but to bring it back... :'DD hopefully those days are behind us now!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME and live more like 6...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME guiding light 4:13, madness 4:39
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME jesus :'DD
i was sure GL must be like 5 minutes or over
i just realised guiding light is actually shorter than madness???? :DD how?
@LittleThing_13 @maja1985 meh, i don't like the song. i hope they won't keep it for europe. :D
@LittleThing_13 @maja1985 it's never appropriate.
@LittleThing_13 @maja1985 i'm glad the played them both, but i suppose madness is there because "no one knows the old stuff in the US", idk.
@lastsmindy no vähän joka kohasta painella vaan. mut en jotenkin osaa kun sit jännittyy aina joku toinen hartia/niska/yms.
and by trying all sorts of things i've just made it worse.
for headaches and neck tension.
could have just taken the painkiller but instead i'm sitting here in a bad position and staring at the screen googling acupressure points
oh lol didn't win anything on euromillions. could have used some of that £29m.
i want to think about the psycho tour. to try to understand that it happened. my brain just goes 'nnnnope'.
@musclexmuseum yeah true but it feels like ages haha.
@musclexmuseum i knooooooowwwww aaaaaahh h shit how can we wait 20 more days
why is the washing machine in use all the time??? how do people create so much laundry? i don't understand.
@musclexmuseum well as long as they keep playing psycho i'll be fine i think. 8) just fucking love that riff. &lt;3____________&lt;3
it's saturday, it's busy as fuck, mostly new people working i think.. what if i just switched my phone off hmmm.
i have a feeling i won't be able to enjoy my precious Saturday Off because i'm expecting a phone call from work.
@musclexmuseum i really hope so! also that the oldies won't just stay at the small clubs. anyway the new stuff is likely to be good! :D
@musclexmuseum their rotations during the last tour were so silly, they shoud have rotated the crap songs. hope they've learned something...
@musclexmuseum they should indeed! it was perfect when they used to play both, i felt terrible for being disappointed to get SS. ;_____;
@musclexmuseum haha i was always a bit disappointed when SS came on, i absolutely love it live but NB is my favourite song in the world ever
@Racket @muse tbh i wouldn't be surprised if it makes an appearance in the US now that the piano is touring too....
@musclexmuseum aaahahhh i've missed it so much, last time i heard it was in paris two years ago. ;_______;
@Racket 
@Racket i think even muse wouldn't be THAT illogical... or so i want to believe.
@musclexmuseum that's beautiful.&lt;3 hope they play it like that at least once in the summer (at a festival i'm at :D)
@Racket then we have to start a campaign, if they play if over the summer let's make sure everyone starts crying in pain, or something idk.
@lastsmindy no AIJJAA
@maja1985 madness :D
@lastsmindy mut oli siinä myös resistance.
@assielina no voi perc :(
and city of delusion and nature_1 in the encore :::D now that would be something!
i thought they would play more new songs tbh. o_O or at least one. in my dream last night they played 8..
starlight creeping back towards the end of the gig is not a good sign
@Racket *shudders* i hope this rubbish will stay across the pond.
did matt play piano intro on new born?????
lol madness though. i hope this is just some US exclusive... :/
@Racket why would you put madness ANYWHERE in the set i'm really struggling to understand.
NEW BORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
now seriously now, off i must fuck before the headache kicks in. all you lucky sods enjoy your gig goddammit.
@CarolinaMillan ikr i don't get who votes them. also new finnish government is as conservative as it gets,some racists as party leaders so..
@CarolinaMillan but i want everything! :D uk general election was a disaster, another 5 years of conservatives, welfare cuts, etc shit
oh man i forgot about possible AP. inb4 explorers.
i'm in the kind of mood i wish i was drunk or at least tired-drunk and there was someone else in here to whom i could say random sentences.
what's happening to my internet and why am i still here
@CarolinaMillan i think you have your shit together much better than me :D and i'm just a greedy twat. plus i'm already sad bc politics &lt;/3
@CarolinaMillan but i'm gonna be sad
gaahhhh so jelly of everyone at the webster hall. :(
i only learned like a month ago that gogglebox is a tv show of people watching tv.
nevermind me i'm tired and disappointed in the politics of the two countries i call/have called home. meh. good night.
because boohoo, i can't be everywhere. so i'm going to pretend everywhere doesn't even exist.
i have a feeling i'll just ignore all kinds of setlist talk tomorrow and pretend nothing is happening. :)
everything is fucked and whyyyy can¨'t i be seeing muse right now ;________; shouldn¨t complain bc only 3 weeks to go but aaashjdbfsfg
gah feeling all sorts of annoying feelings
what's up with youtube why does the image disappear after 1sec then it's just black with audio still working
and do i have a choice, 5 more years under cameron &amp; the bloodsuckers, i think i'm going to need every piece of money i can earn.
this hasn't happened since.... 2012??!?!? probably they will call me to work tomorrow though.
i'm probably speaking too soon but i actually do have a weekend...?! as in both saturday and sunday off. wow.
@assielina ootko nyt ihan varma ettet pääse tulemaan sinne QI-juttuun?
@musclexmuseum haha same. preparing to shed showbiz tears.

@lastsmindy no määki vasta tän justiinsa mun feedistä bongasin aaaaaskjdghjd
@monsieurbellamy aaahhhhhhh me too
OH FLAMING HELL *_______________* 
Olen hiukan huolissani, miten erilaisten suomalaisten tarpeet tässä asetelmassa huomioidaan. ht…
@LinaBellamy @muse @MattBellamy muse account has more followers than matt so these tweets reach more people!
@muse well finally!
@G0ld3nE4gl3 seriously i don't understand why anyone in their right mind would vote them. :/
Well at least i'm seeing muse in 3 weeks. Owen pallett in 4.
apologies for all the politics but as someone with a small income and some health issues this is upsetting the fuck out of me
why yes i love to make a statement probably no one gets but hey
gona wear black today to mourn the nhs and the poor and disabled people who may have to face death bc they cant afford homes/food/healthcare
i'm waiting for your comment on the general election @MattBellamy
gotta love @big_ben_clock

Increase in food banks
Zero hour contracts
Uni fee increases
Widening gap of the rich and poor

*slow …
cameron's no good for anything else than silly dancing 
i suppose there are muse things happening too but can't even focus on that nnow we're doomed.

Fantastic! 

As long as you're not sick, old, a student, disabled, poor, unemployed or a teacher!

#GE…

oh fucking hell
note to self: get a life dammit.
aaaaarrrgh i hate the fact that i'm going to be flipping tables when muse play showbiz in nyc or wherever and i'm not there.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME so it seems! 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME me too! i suppose if they do play there it's going to be them who are announced on the 1st of june??
@assielina höö miksiiiii ;____;
@assielina hei muuten mitä teet tiistai-iltana, kiinnostaisko QI-nauhotuxet ;););))))););))
i'm hungry.
@lastsmindy nojoo niimpä!!! en ymmärrä.
@lastsmindy no aijjaa!!! ydinvoimaa ja puolustusvoimille lisää rahaa!!!!1 (ehkä oon tyhmä mut en tajuu miksi ne suomessa tarttee mitään...)
most of my time here the country's been under tory goverment so it would be interesting to see if labour makes any difference.
and out of curiosity i want to see if things will ACTUALLY really change if labour wins. so i hope they do.
for some reason i don't have much faith in miliband but i guess he's the lesser of two evils.
gahh. finnish politics depresses me. i'm not too hopeful for uk either. :/ idk.
oon ehkä vähän punaviherkuplassa mut ei jotenkin mahdu päähän nämä tälläiset arvot 
@_silverbomber oh that's cool! actually i'm not eligible to vote as i'm not a UK citizen D: all i can do is social media propaganda haha!
that's the new prime minister of finland. _b

"Sipilä quipped that all three party chairs' surnames begin with the letter 'S' and punned that perhaps they could be referred to as the..

jes toi ulkoministerikysymys ::::DDDDDD
kokonaisharkinta kuulostaa nyt maailman ympäripyöreimmältä asialta. ???
@lastsmindy nojoo mää nyt en jotenkin kans. ja jos siitä tulee vielä joku valtiovarainministeri lol
"suomi pysyy avoimena suvaitsevana ja kansainvälisenä" niivvissiin
VITTUU NYT NE JYTKYT SAATANA :(

oikeesti
voi jumalanvittu mikä hallitus ::::DD
the leader of the swedish people's party looks like such a hipster 
kristillisdemarit hallituksessa tai ei perseelleen se tulee menemään ::::DD
miksi leikataan niinistön haastattelua että saadaan räsänen ääneen saatana
finland is doomed. hopefully uk will do better today!!!
loooollllllll
tv reporters trying to interpret faces of the party leaders
oh man today is certainly going to be interesting.
we'll know who will be in government. i'm scared.
whaat interesting political things happening in finland today
well i still didn't win the lottery but got a QI ticket for next week! :DDD
and after all charlottenburg is the twin town/borough/whatever of lewisham. :DD
besides i've been thinking about berlin quite a lot lately for some reason, i want to visit it again and hope i'll like it more this time!
if muse play lollapalooza in berlin im gonna go there instead of bestival. it'll be cheaper and line up is better.
and i could also do some overtime today but i was going to have a self care day that includes pancakes and ice cream. :/
i wish i got post like that more often.
got a letter from the company and was a bit worried as work don't usually send me anything but turns out they owe me 45 quid ::::DD
@assielina aaa okei :DD
@assielina ..öö en mää vieläkään tajua :'DD mihin videoon?? oisko sun edellisessä twiitissä pitänt olla video mukana vai enkö vaan nää? :D
but something must be wrong in the world and spacetime and all surely it's not 20 years since 1995?????????????? wut.
it's been 20 years since team finland won the ice hockey worldchampionship. (yeahyeah they won 2011 too but -95 is THE thing.)
@assielina ??? nyt meni kyllä ihan ohi. :D
Nothing like missing your train by 30secs when you've finished work over 1h late. And the next one isn't until who knows when.
just as i thought instead of starting work at 5 i'm "free" to start as soon as i can. stupid markdowns. oh well moar money.&lt;3456
@assielina aaahahah oisit voinu heittää sitä jollain hedelmällä :D
i've seen a massive ukip banner on a balcony of one of the tower blocks in canada water, i find it offensive, can i report it to the police?
@assielina mitä häh teidän asdaan just nyt vai että se shoppaa asdassa nykyään vai mit????? :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i like the who too but for some reason i imagine ac/dc put on a better live show... have seen neither so idk for 100%. :D
3 weeks and 2 days until muse tho. *_____________*
just how sad is my attempt to get rich by winning the lottery
"a jackpot, plus one lucky guaranteed millionaire on the Lotto raffle every Wednesday in May" i am waiting.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME man i'd rather have had them headlining glasto instead of the who!
so the who are headlining sunday... err... hmmm.
i keep going to bed awfully early these days.
the internets against tories and ukip restore my faith in humanity for a bit but i'm scared what if this happens D: 
should i take a nap or do something productive
i wonder if matt will vote lib dems again ::::::DD if he's even gonna vote that is.
i am sure there will be some sort of revenge against me.
sssssso another big ass spider in the bathroom (identical to the one i just killed). i give up.
i think the fumes from the insect spray gave me the brain damage i totally deserve tho.
i wish i wasn't so terrified of them so i wouldn't have to resort to brutal killing but what can you do.
summer's first big ass spider has been dealt with. i feel like such an evil cunt. :(
#ToriesOutNow seriously
40 cases of suicides linked to problems with Welfare Payments!

@lastsmindy no päässä tuntuu vähä jännältä mutta ehkä vaan joku nestehukka
@musclexmuseum oh, right. me neither. D
never had one like that before, i felt my head was about to explode from all the hyperventilation.
well i went to work, find out i was expected to start half an hour earlier and then proceeded to have a panic attack. =)
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @musclexmuseum blimey! D: well i'm not gonna make a run for it, i don't think i will even be there early enough:D
@musclexmuseum what does that say before muse incubus and the hives??? i can't read it's too small
"You have no idea who I am, do you?" #MayThe4thBeWithYou 
i've had so many bananas todau considering it's only midday i feel like i've been queuing. ;_________;
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME unless of course you queue at the festival gates since forever :D but idk how that works never done it haha.
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME after their favourite artist has performed.
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME you don't run for barriers at festivals. you just hang close to it and if you're lucky some people leave
even if labour wins i don't think things will get better for the wage slaves. why is everything so fucking fucked.
but no can do gotta go earn that £26. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
gaahhhhh really don't feel like going to work. can i call in sick if i'm PMSing like fuck???
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME it will be 8 years this autumn! haha i can imagine! it aired in finland months before i moved here and i fell in love too.

one of the volunteer applications requires a referee, someone who's known you for at least 2 years but can't be a friend or family member???
what if my true calling is to be a health and safety inspector ?!
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @muse the whole tour feels most surreal but at the same time like the most natural and normal thing ever.
this is causing some sort of hyper ventilation now need some simpsons to calm down
fucking hell i completely forgot about volunteering how do i voluteer at bestival
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 i imagine probably nov-dec and maybe january??? idk
oops my evening hasn't quite gone as i planned.
@Racket @SHOWBlZSYNDROME matt may have slipped another festival date 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME well that's how late it is :D but it's only a couple of weeks after reading and leeds so not that late in the end.
@LinaBellamy 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i think it's just part of the festival round. or at least i hope so. D:
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME .... except tickets are £195 ::::DDD no day tickets.
fucks sake muse why u play too far away or in too expensive places when in the uk dammit
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME its not IOW but a festival called bestival on the same island in september
looolllllll they are no day tickets to bestival and the standard ticket is nearly 200 quid lol
@musclexmuseum yeah i thought so too he seems so nervous :'DD
am i imagining it or is it old news or what help
shiiit
bestival
did matt say isle of wight in that snooker interview or what
i love that photo. :') #lastRT
damn i felt something small and round in my jacket pocket but it was just a button instead of a coin. :(
later today hopefully freshly baked cinnamon buns and new episode of orphan black!
crisis averted, going to the supermarket it is instead of feeling super shit! at least for now.
torn between ok and sad and was just about to have a crying fit when one of my bosses called to ask about the markdowns i did yesterday :')
i want to bake cinnamon buns.
tesco cough syrup has the awful cherry flavour i dont want to be dependent on that shit
cough can you fuck off please you've stayed too long now
and AGAIN only 2 matching lotto numbers goddammit
sudden muse feels. what do i do with them i don't know.

muse in less than 4 weeks omg
not like "ooh lets see if i can still play new born intro and maybe a couple of other things" max.twice a year...
where could i find inspiration to practise daily??? or almost daily.
my fingers still remember bits of plug in baby. hot damn.
i'm having the wildest saturday night and i'm totally live blogging it.
gahhh i wish i had proper instrument, these toys aren't very iinspiring.
i also found that bloody adapter i was looking for last time i was travelling abroad. and couldn't find it so had to buy a new one.
oh look what i found 
@LittleThing_13 aw man sorry to hear that! hope you'll get your gig soon!!
@LittleThing_13 hehe i guess! but i had to wait for 11 years to meet matt, bloody hell! you ever met them?
i don't think anything is ever going to cause me as much pain as not being musically talented.
@LittleThing_13 first time meeting matt! well i did high five him in belfast. :D but even meeting dom and chris years ago was hella awkward.
@LittleThing_13 haha i wouldn't call it amazing :D just struggled a bit with words and stuff so i guess pretty average fan behaviour. :D
i'm just gonna burn my keyboard and then hide in some dark corner forever and cry.
note to self: never ever again watch a video of someone (other than da bellz) playing any muse song on piano.
@LittleThing_13 yeah and i'm sure there are people acting proper weird, i'm surprised myself how i handled it xD but i still feel paranoid.
i have a ~day off~ tomorrow, i hope i'll have some energy, i want to finish a couple of sewing projects.
@LittleThing_13 matt actually does talk to people quite a lot! i was just convinced i come across as some sort of a creep..
@hyper_chondriac those questions every night :D now that people seem to be hanging out in there...
@hyper_chondriac at least after a gig you can talk about that! and yes there's all the album stuff now but i think they have to deal with
@hyper_chondriac same, i wouldn't even know what to say in that sort of situation (although there'd be lots of things...)
@LittleThing_13 haha nothing it actually went pretty well :D just my own expectations of how such things would go are always too high lol.
forever super embarrassed about everything i said and did when i met matt in exeter.
ooh nice #VoteCameronOut
my ex pupil (yes i taught his class for a week during work experience aaages ago) isn't in this year aw.
am i old or what i can't recognise even 10 names in the finnish hockey team :::::D prob most of them are younger than me, too.
going to visit the cat cafe next month just booked a table!!!!! ◕ ◡ ◕
@assielina kah, no se on odoteltava ens vaaleihin sitte... :'DDDD
@assielina aaa öö onko ne siis samaan aikaan?? ::::D ois kait pitäny rekkautua siihen juttuun 20 april mennessä..
that was supposed to be few not ew
holy shit ASIWYFA were amazing!!! my ears will be ringing for the next ew weeks probably.
srsly tho why all this drowsiness? :/ and i'm going to see ASIWYFA tonight and tomorrow morning i'll have to wake up at 6.30. fuuuuucckk.
@lastsmindy nii limppiskit ja sellaiset&lt;3234567
exactly 4 weeks until rockavaria!!!
whyyyy am i so tired all the time

those false colour images of mercury going round the internets over the past few days are so cool i want a t-shirt with them printed on
@MattBellamy 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah sometimes it helps to sleep on it. at least a little.
i wish i had a cat. ;__________; (and that i wasn't allergic.)
OH HEY IT'S MAY i'm going to see muse this month
how can white chocolate and orange cookies taste so good i will never understand oh god
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME no probs! and yeah i know. i wish there was an actual on/off switch, and feels didn't come and go so randomly and suddenly.
@LinaBellamy i will as soon as i have the money which is probably never lol. i'd prob be more excited about travelling outside europe tbh :D
@LinaBellamy who knows maybe they'll do small clubs in between! and at least arenas might get the same sort of setlists but longer!
also i was gonna go a couple of days without anything sweet and i nearly made it today but sainsburys in shepherds bush had cookies on offer
seeing purity ring tonight made miss crystal castles for some reason.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i don't know what's up but... 
@LinaBellamy hmm maybe... but then again south american shows are always special too! i wish i could experience it one day.
@LinaBellamy i know i am because i can't go ;_______________; but then again i'm a greedy twat haha.
#ShowbizForSummerFestivals goddammit @muse @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard
@lastsmindy no kai sen pitää olla aika tujua tekoa kans :D
@musclexmuseum indeed! :D i got a high visibility vest at glasto last year and punters even came to ask me directions, that was something!
@musclexmuseum exactly!!! plus free food. :D
want to nap. mustn't forget i'm going to a gig tonight. but whyyyyyyy shepherds bush it's so far away.
@musclexmuseum haha i know i did the same with glasto &amp; muse in 2010.
@lastsmindy no ei oo semmosta kattilaa :(((
@musclexmuseum omg :D
@ManuBiondi @hyper_chondriac yeah exactly.. haha i know i kind of want to go.. but then again.. meh. if i lived closer maybe then. :p
@ManuBiondi @hyper_chondriac i don't wanna go stalking. plus it's on the opposite side of the town for me, no time or money...
@musclexmuseum yeah i mean matt said in belfast they might play fucking _uno_ and then they actually did. so yeah i really hope so.
meh i want tickets to editors and wolf alice but can't afford such things in the end if i want to go on muse tour next year. :/
not gona get over muse in scandinavia but not in glasto boo fucking hoo
now that muse are a small band again who play club gigs they didn't have to headline pyramid, they could do other stage instead innit??? =))
hmm i don't think i have a kettle or pot that's suitable for frying......
help someone bring me food and things
it seems to be called funnel cake.
and the thing that looks like a brain
oh god all the sugary things
and then there's these things as well i don't know what they're called in english 
gaaaaaaaaahhhhh 
fucking hell i NEEED to try to bake them, just need loads of some sort of oil..... :/ i'm not sure how to feel about that.
i'm telling you there is nothing better than these things with a perfectly crispy surface aaaaaaahhhhhhhh 
it's mayday time and this is one of those times i miss finland, the home made donuts!!!!!!!! ;_________;
@musclexmuseum oh me too! i hope the download talks weren't just a load of bollocks.. although they do seem to stick to their words nowadays
gigs*
if they bring the piano for US gig what if they bring the megaphone too. D:
and i was going through all my queen albums looking for my new jam 
although they were still going to do the euro tour somehow, stiill, there was sense of THE END in the air. man that was painful.
and that was that.
oh god i had a terrible nightmare, muse were to stop touring. D: it was the 28th of june and they played their last gig somewhere in the US
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac @ManuBiondi yeah ive always wanted to go to pinkpop! :( and werchter too but it's glasto weekend.
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi i think you're right, literally.
@Racket @muse @MattBellamy @Dominic_Howard @CTWolstenholme aww. so yeah muse gigs please!!! lots to celebrate!
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi same! if it is indeed their only uk festival appearance... (big weekend doesn't count :p)
"We asked if the title will be played Showbiz Matt replied laughing "Yes, maybe for Bercy and London" " london eh???? sounds good to me.
@Racket @muse @MattBellamy @Dominic_Howard @CTWolstenholme i did indeed! that was in 2004, how old were you then? :p
@hyper_chondriac @ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME also that yes.
@ManuBiondi @hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME hot diddly damn!!!
@Racket @muse @MattBellamy @Dominic_Howard @CTWolstenholme i second that, i bought absolution on a march 4th.

#CitizenErasedForDownload
@ManuBiondi @hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME WHAAAAAAAAAAAA mmmmmm yes please!!!!!!!!!!!
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi yeah i want to believe so! just as long as they are smart enough not to play it at DL... :'DD
imagine all the gigs you could go to and all the food you could eat with that kind of money................
some lucky sod won 2 million
oh dang only 2 matching numbers
now let's check lotto numbers
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi it's the same to me as madness, tried to like it but it just get worse imo. :(
@ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac ooh i admire that! :D i think drones will be the 1st album i can't avoid spoilers with...
i wonder if me spending about 100% of my free time in a weird position staring at a screen has anything to do with this constant headache.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi @hyper_chondriac fingers crossed!
@ManuBiondi @hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME i just hope dead inside will be the most 'meh' track on the album...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac @ManuBiondi ...it bloody better be!
if i end up going to a gig in paris i'm not going to queue. this time. srsly.
although i knew things would happen then haha. but somehow it's getting more and more real.
i was finally getting excited about summer and now i have to stress about next fucking year
gaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh whhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME this sucks. :(
wellll at least feb-april shouldn't be the busiest/most expensive tourist season eh? right?????
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i know that's what makes it even worse....
february is so soon i'm not gonna have time to save money. ;______;
gona cry
aw man muse are never no.1 in those stupid lists and even if it's only a stupid nme list it still makes me feel like a proud mum :') #lastRT
@ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac ah right. anything else interesting/link??? :D
@ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac ohh. is it that guy who met matt yesterday??
@ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac oohh what when how
can't believe i discovered that one at work as it is mostly crap you have to listen to all day long. but man i am so in love. &lt;3________&lt;3
this is my jam!! &lt;3 
i just realised what if abso oldies meant eternally missed D:D:D:D::::::::
@assielina saanko mää sellaisessa äänestää?? pitäisi ottaa enempi kaikesta selevää.. :'DDD
i was handed leaflets by the green party this morning as i was on my way to work, makes me wish i could vote. :(
a month until rockavaria :')))
unexpected day off tomorrow! i don't even have therapy this week. what to do with all this time!?
"That's a typo." 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME oohhh i'd love that! doubt they're going to do anything like that soon though...
and #ShowbizForFestivals all of them
but the important thing here is now #TSPforDownload @muse
i'd love to see that one day....
what if they play endlessly !
prob citizen erased too
so usa will get piano songs  hmm
i keep forgetting about the US gigs and realised they'll probably play their abso oldies there :'DDD
hey @muse and your rehearsals #TSPforDownload @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard @Nowherethomas (assassin too pls)
@LinaBellamy haha i hope no one's calling anyone bitter over that! i'm not even too keen on music videos these days tbh.
#TSPforDownload
video: meh, #needsmorechris, song still meh. absolution rehearsals: HOT DAMN
i'm more interested in that dom tweet than the video tbh.
@Dominic_Howard #TSPforDownload
@musclexmuseum ah. i understand.
@musclexmuseum ohh that sucks! aren't there any coaches/trains etc to central brussels, you'd think there'd be more airport connections??
@musclexmuseum aw man. :( yeah there was like one bus a day or something?? i had to abandon that plan too bc of the inconvenient timings...
@musclexmuseum megabus between luxembourg city and brussels was £1 last time i checked...
or try picking them and pieces of balloons by hand at 6am in the morning.
yassssssss ban them stupid things!!! #lastRT although i thought they were already banned last year but w/e just get rid of them yay!
butbut if they play a new song it would be cooler to _be_there_. meh.
to the stream.
why am i thinking of going to norwich on that day just in case i can hear it outside the area when i could stay home save money and listen
@Musefan626 aaahhh right! well that leaves me out i wouldn't know any such songs. :::D good luck!
@Musefan626 where can you get them?? i thought it was locals only and the rest sold out...
@wearescientists pls tell me you're playing glastonbury. it's been 5 years (=too long).
toaster stopped working mid-toast. :(
matt keeps saying 'totally' a lot these days.
oh my god such darlings &lt;3__________________&lt;3 :')))))))
matt in the hood so precious though awww :')))
i go to work and muse do things in the meanwhile
srsly i'm no cook but DAMN i just made some delicious pasta. o________o
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @musclexmuseum @monsieurbellamy ooohh let's hope we'll end up in the same one! :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @musclexmuseum @monsieurbellamy yay!!! are you staying in a dorm?
@musclexmuseum yeah i was trying to look for one nearer to it but for some reason couldn't find any, and this one was only on the 2nd page
@musclexmuseum the one i booked first.
@musclexmuseum oh excellent! :D and i think this one is pretty much walking distance from everything, so in the end prob the same price as
@musclexmuseum well actually i'm cancelling my reservation (the deposit was only £2 so not that bad...) and booking the other one xD
oh my god WHY did i eat most of my chocolate last night now i can taste again and this is so good i'm going to cry.
@musclexmuseum haha man now that i checked that one it's not THAT much more expensive damn i wish i hadn't been so hasty :'DD
@musclexmuseum it's quite far away but meh.
@musclexmuseum actually i already found one for under a tenner per night and booked it quickly, they only had a few beds left.
why does it have to be the hottest time and the most expensive travel wise gahhhh
also i'm missing budapest so bad. sziget or not, i think i might try to go and spend my birthday there yet again, CAKES
and since chris departed they haven't really been the same. ;____;
editors in london in october, to buy ticket or not to buy ticket? mustn't go crazy with all this money now.
i think this is all my stuff booked now though. ;________; stupid muse why u go so far away my little moneys can't reach you
even though it's going to be infernally hot i can't wait for the summer travels!!!
booking booking things aaahhhhhhh
ahoy-hoy! people going to portugal, have you booked your accommodation yet/where are you staying??
man that was the start of bringing back the b-sides. :')))))
listening to the new mew album and this band reminds me of a certain gig in helsinki two years ago and i think it was in my dream last night
@LinaBellamy yeah! let's make this happen! :D
is it any wonder i have a mild case of ocd and just can't go to sleep before everyone else in this house when stuff like this happens...
@LinaBellamy they are waiting for me to win the lottery so i can buy a ticket too. =)
unattended lit candle next to some clothes hanging on a drying rack. rrriiiiiiiggghht i'm no fire inspector but.... jesus fucking christ. :O
(that must have been the first time i've heard her refer to matt as bellamy, she always calls muse by their first names : D) /important
"bellamy is not with that kate hudson anymore! D:" -my mum, after reading months old gossip mag.
people: WOW REVOLUTIONARY. BREAK DOWN BARRIERS
trans boy: [wears makeup]
people: um i thought yo…
could i please get my sense of taste back already??? i'm wasting precious chocolate. ;_______;
@hyper_chondriac @Nowherethomas i've been wondering the same thing
i found 2p on the floor at work yesterday, that's something i guess....
mexico isn't even sold out i gathered? where can i get heaps of money
oh boohoo picked the wrong lotto numbers again, surprisingly.
i want a kitty ;_______;
why do they have to run where i would normally walk to work now i'm gonna have to take the train
stupid marathon why do i have to work tomorrow
if i was to purchase an item with fake pockets i suppose i would be allowed to pay part of it with fake money???
fake pockets. who invented them and why?????????
@Musefan626 you should just tattoo number 1 on your hand for future gigs :D (i would actually almost seriously consider it haha, for fun)
i hope i win on lotto tonight. :):):)
i'm going to be working with my new boss today i'm scared
if only my saturdays were like that... #lastRT
@lastsmindy no sillä on aika peloittavat hampaat :DD
@lastsmindy :DDDD no ketä sitä vapulla nyt olikaan, stubbi ja vanhanen etc...
@lastsmindy aivan! :'DDD josta tulikin mieleeni pitäiskö kinkkuunt ehä poliitikoille oma osio?? ::::DD
@lastsmindy no kannattais ;))))) onhan meilläki puolue, voidaan mennä oppositioon niitten kaa.
@lastsmindy @vappeni TEE!!! :'DDDD se onkin kaivannut jo vähän spämmielämää ja muutakin.
@lastsmindy :DDD mitäs sitten ku törmäät siihen jossain turussa?! :D (eikö se sielläpäin hengaa..)
@lastsmindy @vappeni ps tommonen jep jep siitä tulee aina mieleen iltalypsyn ne poliitikkoimitaatiot ja setä sauli sanoi aina että jepjep.
@lastsmindy @vappeni :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD mää en tiedä miksi mut tää on jotenkin niin hauskaa!!!
i am pretty sure some of this stuff coming out of my nose is part of my so called brain.
@lastsmindy @vappeni ai tää ongelma :eyebro: 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i was preparing to move out actually, otherwise it would have become too weird :'DD
i don't think i'll ever have this much money again. :'DD
hellooooooo payday!
oh good god i had a dream/nightmare matt and his new gf were going to move into our house :'DDD
@lastsmindy @vappeni :DD
looking at my signed absolution and 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME that was one of the best and worst moments of my life. :')
hurry up rockavaria!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but it was painful i'm telling you. my heart and soul are still in pieces.
lol
i don't think i've ever been as sincere with expressing my emotions as in that night of brighton screaming DON'T LEAVE MEEEEEEE
one month ago around this time though........ ;____________;
woah man, 100 followers, the newest ones being gandhi and 5 seconds of something. erm.
getting more and more excited about foo fighters at glasto!
@lastsmindy noniin.. 
i mean.. good if young people are interested in politics, in one way or another... :'DD 
war secures resources and economic influence
provocateurs are at protests
gov't paid…
(hahaha that sentence doesn't even make sense it probably didn't happen lol wtf)
maaaannnnnnn is it a month since the last time i talked to someone who plays in muse? ;____________;
@hyper_chondriac promo i suppose
i'm finding it hard to recognise chris these days!
holy shit 
..in hyde park" and i was so close to buying a ticket for that too.
and i managed to grab the last ticket for exeter. and there were other events like "muse will say hello on a screen during kasabian's gig..
i had a dream there was going to be another and they were going to play exeter and cardiff, presale was like 11pm and i almost forgot it
that was my least favourite of the psycho tour but still.
one month since brighton ;____________;
@lastsmindy 1)mun suomenkielinen blogikaan ei oikeen kulje 2)oon joskus alottanu jo kaks ja toinen tyssäs jo ennenku alotinkaan 3) ei.
ok 
oh look at me i know everything better.
it's just all about promoting some corporate useless crap and casual sexism and such things.
such a shame so many people who can reach thousands and millions of others don't use their position to try to make things better
and there's lots of them.
their fans are young and probably do anything they're told to by their idols so they could have the potential to save the planet
why couldn't all them directions and biebers and whatnot talk about the importance of recycling
i guess i just want to start attention whoring big time. but for what?
or maybe i already have too many megalomaniac projects going on.
i also want to start writing a blog in english?! imagine entire posts with the quality of my tweets!!!
even the guitar has become some sort of a clothes rack. D: i am ashamed of myself.
would it help if i stopped using my keyboard as a place to store things i can't really put anywhere else at the moment.
where to find the inspiration to start playing piano again??? 11 years ago it was muse, but what now.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @LinaBellamy @maja1985 exactly. if only this was realistically possible... :'DDD
@LinaBellamy @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 well if i could get into a muse gig in japan i wouldn't care for barrier tbh, as long as i'm in.
@LinaBellamy @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 oh wow.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @LinaBellamy mind you i don't know this for sure :D that's just the impression i have..
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @LinaBellamy i'm sure those things can be translated, but i think you need an address &amp; bank details in japan etc
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @LinaBellamy yeah same. not sure about the queuing thing.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @LinaBellamy what i've heard though is that it's difficult to get tickets from outside of japan..
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @LinaBellamy next time muse are playing!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @LinaBellamy @maja1985 i want to go there too! muse or not. (it would be an excellent bonus of course!)
uno?? fury??????? agitated????? futurism??????? ??????????????? it's just one of these moments again. that's all.
how about that psycho tour? what the hell was that?????
that should probably be owe instead of own now that i think of it. me fail english and so on
do i own somebody something i can pay you back now :'DD (i hope not but just in case)
yes it's money, my favourite subject to tweet about.&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
it's like that 70 euros i lost on T2L tour in italy has suddenly come back to me. :') just in another currency.
i have suddenly got 70 quid i don't know what do with all this fortune
well i'm glad i don't even have a theoretical chance of going to the US gigs, getting tickets seems to be impossible.
@ManuBiondi haha italy is one of my favourite places on earth! :D but i guess this is just a visitor point of view.
i just remembered i also had a dream about THAT pizza place in napoli. oh jesus.
@ManuBiondi and the thing with food, i end up having pizza margherita most often ::D but it's just so good omg
@ManuBiondi haha yeah i've seen more places in italy than in the UK and i've lived here for nearly 8 years..
boo to the hoo like i havent had enough
i want more muse gigs. ;____________;
@ManuBiondi true dat! :D i started in sorrento peninsula and went all the way to bergamo and como, via rome, and a little stopover in siena!
@lastsmindy ei näytä puhtaalta...
@lastsmindy .................
@lastsmindy :'DDDDD joo-o. mut siis joo en tajuuu.
@lastsmindy no hyi saatana en mee koskemaan semmosiin!!111
srsly i have never felt as good physically as i did after that week in italy in jan, local quality food.&lt;3333&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 ;________; i miss u.
and i want to go back to italy and just EAT oh god
suddenly such massive urge to travel! everywhere! now! although i'm going to some new places in the summer but i want mooooore!!!
@lastsmindy no sanoppa muuta. D: vieläki on kalsarit pöydällä. tekis mieli kirjottaa lappu mut toisaalta taas.. ???????!?!?
@lastsmindy @assielina jee! :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME aw man of course.
or that oasis reunion would be fucking brilliant.
idk if the cure are doing anything at the moment but they should headline the sunday at glasto. or nine inch nails.
i had a dream my hair was really thick and curly, that was amazing.
meh i could have gone to work to earn some extra ££ but i'm still ill. :(
@musclexmuseum @maja1985 @fabripav in the end real fans are those who went to the second wembley night in 2010. =)
why was the heating on again? why is there a pair of someone's old boxers on the kitchen counter? help me understand.
@musclexmuseum @GypsyJaeger and it seems it's kind of turning into some sort of a competition and that's just taking all the fun out of it.
look how positive i am!
good thing i have two days off now so i'm not wasting my precious working hours lying in bed sick.
@GypsyJaeger @musclexmuseum i mean the general atmosphere. a bit uncomfortable. all this real fan shit, when it's all about the money...
@GypsyJaeger @musclexmuseum man as much fun as travelling for gigs is it's a bit scary how things seem to have got out of proportion. :/
@musclexmuseum @GypsyJaeger aw man i'm unreal then. :(
@GypsyJaeger @musclexmuseum who's real fans now? the ones who go to the US gigs from outside the US? :D
i just realised going to brighton will never feel the same again.
eating feels like such a waste.
i've said it before and i'll say it again: the worst thing about having a cold is not being able to taste food. ;___________;
@delilah_1982 @maja1985 oh alright i didn't even do much searching tbh :D
@maja1985 that one's not complete though. :(
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @musclexmuseum i think the whole album launch/celebration just means it's a promo gig and they will play ~some~ new songs.
@NicholaMoreland me too, as much as i want eu tour to happen now i still need time to save money. and yes i am! better be worth the price..
@NicholaMoreland aw man, yeah i know it's ridiculously expensive. i'm trying to win lottery too haha, can't even afford to play atm tho. :'D
@NicholaMoreland oh  no! i thought you were coming to download? :(
@NicholaMoreland me neither. :( although i know i'm going to see them in the summer but..... waaahh. ;____; /such good arguments
@NicholaMoreland me! let's form a support group.
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME exactly. really i don't think even muse would do such a thing.
well that was a nice and refreshing 3 hour nap!
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME i think it's just worded like that and the exclusive first-look will be maybe one or two new tracks etc
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME oh right. but it doesn't say exactly they're going to play the full thing???
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @musclexmuseum where is this info coming from??
stupid cold
yeahyeahyeah whinety whine
im not even jealous of people seeing muse but the fact that it is a realistic option for some people to do such things. just HOW.
wow i wish i had the money to travel to the other side of the planet to see muse with such a short notice, just like that.
@maja1985 christmas present 2015 muscle museum from exeter.
oh wait i can listen to this on my mp3 player ::::::D
OH COME ON more muse pls i have to leave in less than 10 mins ;___;
except foos and muse of course.
oh god every song is this mash up seems to be part of that crap i have to listen to at work.
it's like chopping off a piece of a painting because it's "too large for the exhibition"
why do radio edits even exist
omg there are cameras shit
#MuseOnGrimmy is there a band you would follow to as many gigs as possible?
#MuseOnGrimmy why would you not do loyalty cards for fans who go to alot of shows? every 10th gig free or something.
#MuseOnGrimmy look 
#MuseOnGrimmy above all though, thank you for bringing some oldies and b-sides back. hope they stick around. the nostalgia value is huge. &lt;3
too many stupid questions in my mind..........
#MuseOnGrimmy will you do a surprise set in glastonbury this year please?
#MuseOnGrimmy do the "pitchforks" from your OOS cover stage design from reading and leeds still exist somewhere and can i have one of them?
#MuseOnGrimmy download will be your heaviest set ever right? RIGHT?
and then they'll never play it again. ;____;
and the regular front row will be there matt will go "oh it's you guys who wanted this"
i'm sure though showbiz will be back for the US shows though.
gaaahh why do i have to go work i wasn't even supposed to start early.
#MuseOnGrimmy please bring showbiz back for the summer festivals.
@Racket i'm trying to do my bit!
@Racket well i'm glad if it was!
i'm sorry i may have spammed a bit of your timeline with useless crap. i will stop now.
(i still find that dom dom bit funny.)


i can even put something aside for future muse gigs. :')))) now come on payday!!!
if only i had that many unused holiday hours every month.... i'd earn almost as much as full time workers
omg just seen my payslip and i'm gonna be rich hot damn
hi i'm tweeting all the things that just happen to cross my mind
stupid everything
also i really do not want to go to work tomorrow but can't really not go either
no
didn't happen
i'm looking at the pics and i just
i would cry if i wasn't so tiredd and dehydrated
i still cannot believe that happened. or muscle museum. or anything. what.
waaaaaaaaahh
or talking more like blurting out words, but surprisingly in pretty much correct order
HEY it was one month ago around this time when i may have been talking to matt bellamy
just HOW do people afford to travel from one continent to another all the time and how can i get my hands on that kind of fortune
@musclexmuseum join the club
nor taken a shower and i need to be up early tomorrow and will probably have lost my voice over the night, work is going to be interesting.
how the fuck is it past 10 already i havent even had dinner
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 well as long as they keep it at that, no more musical influences pls. -_-
@lastsmindy no nii sanoppa muuta.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 well yeah true.... but i guess i was just hoping for something... less u2-esque. :p
@lastsmindy AINIIN perkele varmaan. :( ja en tiiä meneekö nyt ainakaa hirveesti mut siis kyl uskon et ne perus tyypit ainakin. joo en tiiä.
@maja1985 yeah true as long as they do that!
daaamnn amanda palmer in the uk in june but prob can't afford tickets :( hope she plays glastonbury again!
suuren yleisön huomio vaan pois sellaisista joilla on järkeviä ja mukavia ja tasa-arvoisia ajatuksia. sattumaako... #lastRT #vaalit2015
TELL ME ABOUT IT #lastRT
@maja1985 yeah but as their own, headliing. man i was hoping they'd leave all the stupid theatrics behind.. (yes i'm counting this as such)
maybe thats the thing "they've never done before" they were talking about for south america.
so there will be space
if that stupid stage sticks around for europe i'm hoping it'll be relatively easy to get barrier because everyone will go wherever matt is
well at least field day tickets have arrived. woohoo.
the cough syrup i just bought is supposed to "make your cough more productive". maybe i just don't understand english but this sounds wrong.
and i'm supposed to do something with the windows i hope it will be okay that the mannequins are covered in snot and mucus and things
be a cover manager and the new person who still doesn't know shit
and my cold is getting worse. tomorrow i'm supposed to work extra hours and i'm going to be the only one who knows what's what bc there will
i've been _out_ and what have i missed, 360 thing stage, usa shows, everyone going to seee them except me
@hyper_chondriac i know! but i've had to miss several uk gigs so i'm not THAT bothered. if it was in london that would be different...
@assielina joo..
@ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME there are loads of organisations who need people, i'm going through the glasto recycling team.
i don't even live in finland anymore but i'm scared wow. why do people vote for these dickheads i will never understand.
just listened to an interview of one of the racists who got elected last night (with double the amount of votes he got in 2011) and wow
niiiiiiiiiiiiinnn paljon facepalmausta ja hirvitystä :| #lastRT
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi indeed it is! you don't get much sleep though but at least they give you free food and a fancier camping area:D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @ManuBiondi yes i'm volunteering! litter picking in the morning, watching bands for the rest of thte day. :D
@ManuBiondi @SHOWBlZSYNDROME i'm going to see them at glastonbury! :D and for free! uk tour was a bit too expensive...
@assielina ;____; mut mut.. kakun äärellä voisi myös käsitellä politiikkaa ja sensemmoista syvällisesti!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i'd hope so, if they have any sense they'll play mostly crowd pleasers in norwich and hevier stuff for us. but it's muse...
i think i've also lost my sense of taste and i was supposed to go and have some cake today. :(((
gaaaahh nearly 20 degrees and sunny, and i need to wear something warm to try to keep this cold at bay. D:
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah but i guess it's a good opportunity to promote new albums for a wider crowd, and i think dead inside will go down well
avance tickets to norwich would actually be £9 one way shiiit :'DD oh well..
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah i'm not really expecting much from bbc1 kind of crowd... :/
@assielina @lastsmindy mut ei hitto siellä ois se buffetti! ;________; ja jätskipaikka! voi perseensuti miks on palkkapäivä vasta pe!!!
@assielina @lastsmindy no ehkä se sun entinen kämppä mutta kyllähän sää nyt jo oot siellä essexin pile-elämän keskuksessa melkein §§
but let's think about what happened one month ago instead.
excuses! =) i would still totally go if i had the chance.
crowd would probably be annoying, would have to sit through david guetta or something, meh.
tbh i'm not too fussed, it's going to be a crap setlist (inb4 showbiz...), wouldn't be able to afford to go to norwich for that just now
and then they realise "oohhh such a good song let's play this at all the _metal_ festivals!!!1"
oh god i just realised they'll probably play madness :'DDD to have something to suit the crowd.....
so how can i win tickets to that thing. do i need to listen to radio one???? D:
or maybe they'll play fury and everyone will think THAT's the new song. =)
but let's think about the setlist it'll probably be psycho, dead inside, smbh, starlight, new song, uprising, hysteria or something.
but why do they do this and not glastonbury for example??? ;___________;
and introduced morgan, and they did sunburn with both guitar and piano.
last time they premiered knights of cydonia ;_________; and starlight lol.
oh bugger me stupid big weekend
@lastsmindy @assielina hittoq ois kiva myös colchesterin reissu mutta raha ;__________;
EI SAATANA :'DDD*D*D* 
omg the bing translations on twitter are the best
@assielina @lastsmindy (ei hitto nää translationit "I guess tomorrow to get to when you hold in the library to consume the trainers" :'DDDD)
@assielina @lastsmindy no voihan bylly :(
@lastsmindy @assielina oolrait! laitan vaikka texxtaria sit.
@lastsmindy @assielina mää tällä normirutiinilla varmaan meen, 9 aikaan herään ja muutaman tunnin dataan :D mut ilmottelen sitte!
@lastsmindy @assielina tekis mieli mennä banksiden leoniin koska se on paras (plus leonin filterkahvi&lt;3333) mut sielt ei saa hyvää kakkua :(
@lastsmindy @assielina katotaan mihin aikaan kukakin pääsee ylös :D mää varmaan lienen jo puolen päivän aikaan valmis lähtemään.
koska oon niin kypsä niin on hauskaa se että ei voi kirjottaa/sanoa 'keskusta' ilman 'kusta' hihhih
i've actually been watching this election broadcast for the entire evening oh god.
@lastsmindy voi ei! mut niin siis mulla on kyllä koko päivä aikaa :D entäs @assielina onko tietoo huomisesta??
@lastsmindy no jaksan :DD paree vaan olla vielä makuaistia jäljellä että kakku maistuu! vähän vaan nenässä tuntuu siltä että tapahtuu.
@lastsmindy no aijjaa. mut nii toivottavasti ei mittään ruokamyrkytystä teillä D: paitsi mää taidan kipeytyy. :'DD
@lastsmindy tai ehkä se on vaan se jytky?? D:
(i do apologise for all them finnish retweets i have feels about politics it seems)
@lastsmindy haluut vaan nähä ville niinistön haastattelun :D:D:D:DD (anteex)
gaaahhh. well at least the green party got their best result ever (?).
helevetin persut silti vois jo lopettaa kaikki jytkyt. :(

@assielina looollllll ja ketä on top kolmosessa? kokoomus kepu ja persut???
parliamentary election day in finland today... let's hope it's not going to be as right wing-y as last time!
@ManuBiondi yeah i know! i should have just booked months ago when it was still cheap! but yeah next time. unless i win the lottery.
@maja1985 @hyper_chondriac i love that bit :'DD
@hyper_chondriac 40 daysssss!!!
@ManuBiondi haha that would be cool! :D but unfortunately i don't have the money. :(
hey @muse rather not have piss bottles thrown at you at download? play this 
but yeah maybe in another life. =)
i could do a little ancient aliens tour as well ::::DD
or can i please win the lottery or something i want to go to south america.
dammit muse pls play sziget or something i need more ;____________; only u can stop the pain
RATM would be cool as fuck. but for some reason i don't think they'd only have US headliners....
why are all the good ones not together anymore.
or white stripes
them or led zep or pink floyd or anyhing in that league.
oasis eh? 
@DaniDiveney time goes by too fast...
and i had a dream there was going to be a gig in brighton again.
one month since newport..... ;__________;
and they would play old b-sides and things. yeah. good days.
remember when psycho tour was happening and you'd always be on a train or something and seeing muse in the next coupld of days
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac i've been missing red hair for so long now i think i'm going to dye mine bright red next!
@hyper_chondriac cooooooooooool!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac pics or didn't happen!
@lastsmindy @assielina en määkään mut eipä kai muuta tartte kun just kälättää ja syödä. :D
@lastsmindy hei mul on maanantai vapaa! Etta sillon jos jottain? Entas @assielina paasetko lontoossa kaymaan?
listening to dead inside and trying to get into it. bassline reminds me too much of that of guiding light and meh. it's still a bit meh. :(

my n-key can be such a pain.
any
kids, never listen to ay band
why am i feeling all kinds of stupid feelings now
@GypsyJaeger true! although my wardrobe may disagree...
@GypsyJaeger oohh excellent! although i shouldn't spend money on clothes but band merch doesn't count!!
i kind of decided yesterday i'll go to rome as well but lol flights are suddenly £100+ one way so...
whyyyyyyyyyyy
it pains me to think my muse gigs for this year are over in less than 3 months. D:
@GypsyJaeger omg these shirts are amazing i need to get that 'your ass belongs to me now' one!!!
@maja1985 i didn't even remember the video, just that guy singing in the bushes :D (and now it's stuck in my head for the rest of the night)
@maja1985 was it not popular anywhere else than finland? ::DD and maybe sweden. some quality 90s eurodance. :D 
i wonder if there will ever be a day when i haven't got some sort of headache going on.
@maja1985 i actually had to think for a bit what song this is and i read angels and cry for a sec i thought of e-type.
fucking hell i can't get over how perfect newport and exeter were.
@maja1985 @hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME this is a good conversation. :D
wtf von hertzen brothers at DL too?? :D go finland. i always thought they were some sort of a hipster band...
this nostalgia train is out of control!!!
hmm seems like FFAF have made a lot of albums after one i used to listen to ::::D hope they still play escape artists never die haha.
OH MY GOD funeral for a friend at download and on the saturday pls let it be the main stage and the 17yo semi emo kid in me will be happy :D
@maja1985 aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
@hyper_chondriac exactly!!!!!! and yeah the sun, i have to wear high as fuck SPF otherwise i'll just burn.
stop the press massive news an actor dyed his hair!!!!!!!!! omg!!!!!!!!
@hyper_chondriac i don't mind summer evenings and the festival season but can't stand the heat!!! i like layers too.
@hyper_chondriac YOU UNDERSTAND MY SOUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :')))))
it's 11 and i'm about to go to bed?????
what a stupid day off. i was just waiting for the dinner time for the entire day. and got nothing done.
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME if they're in a relationship ask them if they're not bored shagging the same person every time. that'll teach 'em
@assielina kiiiiitttthhhaaaa
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 i've watched mine quite a few times... ::D
does anyone have persian kittens and can i come and play with them and squeeee at their fluffiness??? *_________*
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME next time ask them if they aren't bored to see their fav movie/eat their fav food etc over and over again!
or i could just say that bit was swedish.
that other tweet was supposed to include an n, in not i
and still 43 days until muse. ;__________;
hot damn new orphan black i two days!!!
help 
@Racket no problemo. :) :)
@hyper_chondriac yeah that's kind of the impression i got too. but the past few weeks have proved ANYTHING'S possible....
@hyper_chondriac which is why they'd better not do another psycho tour now, as much fun as it would be... for those who could afford it lol.
@hyper_chondriac i have a feeling health &amp; safety will find a way to stop it though.
@hyper_chondriac how am i not surprised :D
@hyper_chondriac same. and then there's the arena tour, i need to start saving up for that too.
and i'd probably just miss it because i would be elsewhere watching morrissey or something .:::D
muse should do a surprise show on the saturday tho. =)))
glen posting glasto related things is making me sad. :( when it only has something to do with his roadie academy thing.
@hyper_chondriac oh good heavens no, :::D the cheapest flight i could find would cost me more than a month's salary so...no. meh. :(
i can't believe i have a day off tomorrow.
@hyper_chondriac that's what i've heard. you going?
good things about not going to south america: the crowd would probably be so wild i would die, and it's too hot in there. :)
the illuminati followed me, cool. :)
and give me my money back for all the guiding lights i've had to endure.
stop hurting me please muse
flying to mexico would cost me the same as 2 months rent. or more. why am i not rich.
why do muse still have 16/1 odds though it's not like they're going to clone themselves and play at two places at once.
srsly tho please no.
coldplay bookies' favourite as the 3rd glasto headliner lollllllll
lol i wish i had money to travel to another continent
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac i can see that happening
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac @maja1985 man i didn't even think of that!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac maybe they'll do the european club tour next year, before the arenas...?
does anyone need hangers i've got loads
i wish  i had cupcakes.
aw man last time i saw florence and hot chip at glasto i saw muse too....

oh fucking hell i don't like tomorrow's weather forecast one bit.
and apparently he got a ride in a jubilee line train drivers cab hey tfl i want too :D:D:DDD
i don't even like children but this kid is so cute omg :')) 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i think they will be, if not now then closer to the album release for sure!
holy bollocks it's bright O____________O
is that venus in the western sky rn
and blur or radiohead or something should be the 3rd headliner
owen pallett should play tho
WHY am i still even thinking about this.
i just wish there had been some sort of mix up and kanye would play sunday and then muse saturday.... ;___________;
now if we can't have muse i want royal blood and we are scientists at least.
yaaaasssss suede, dfa1979, belle&amp;sebastian, perfume genius, wolf ailce, maccabees, franz&amp;sparks etc!

on the outside i'm the greatest pie / but i'm bread inside.
also drones release hurry the fuck up
omg need more muse nao
reapers *________________________*
i found a pound coin in my bag! :') unexpected money is the best thing in times like these.
i'm out of bananas too oh man.
last time i went out to buy a missing ingredient for the thing i was baking muse announced a tour, maybe i shoud go lol.
hmm. pizza or no pizza. pizza would mean going out to buy cheese.
@Musefan626 haha maybe. anyway i can't afford either option so i just need to dig out the old keyboard from underneath all my stuff. :D
@Musefan626 thanks! one of my local charity shops was actually selling one for £100 last year.. it was so tempting but...yeah 3rd floor lol.
@CarolinaMillan haha no shit! :P
is everyone suddenly driving a mini or am i just noticing them now for some mysterious reason?
@Musefan626 yeah and i live on 3rd floor so it'd be a pain to get one up here.. which is why i'll have to settle for the cheap electric one.
minimum wage is such a joke.
hahaha i was supposed to have tomorrow of but i'm going to work again. fuck yeah 26 quid!!11!
@Musefan626 hehe thanks! bloody hell that's amazing! anyway i wouldn't be able to have a piano in my flat. :D
@hyper_chondriac happy birthday!!!
if it's across the pond then there aren't even any theoretical possibilities of me going but if anything happens in europe...
hmm didn't even think of the possibility these gigs might be worldwide?! lol pls no i can't
@Musefan626 art&amp;music is what i wish i could do! :D i just need to find a proper piano somewhere... and some inspiration. and time. /excuses
@Musefan626 i can imagine! i tried once but gave up, i'm not that musical unfortunately. :( plus i only have crap keyboard, not enough keys!
@Musefan626 oh man you can play it? that is so cool i wish i could too. *______*
maybe i should try to see if i can fix my scooter...
oyster card balance low. gotta walk to work. pls mp3player battery don't die on me now.
they are prob going to play showbiz though. ;_______; and then never again.
oh my god owen :') #lastRT i have forgotten i'm going to see him again this summer, in the midst of all the muse.
oh club gigs in north america. oh well at least i don't have to worry about tickets and stuff. so nice to be poor. =)))))
but how amazing and refreshing it is to read an article/column/whatever without a comment section!
i just spent half an hour at the kitchen table reading a magazine?!?! 'cause i'm old school like that.
also there is all that chocolate waiting at work. unless they ate it all today.... :O
i was so looking forward to tomorrow it was supposed to be my day off but now i'm working. =))))) oh well. no can do. need that money.
@Racket @muse yes exactly.
@lastsmindy no hei sit kun oot täällä!!! jotain pitää kakkuilla! sikäli kun mul on vapaata. MUT SIIS AIJJAA TOI POKSI JA KAIKKI EN KESTÄ.
i wish i had an extra 40 quid. :(

don't think i saw it in between those?!
my first fury happened 7 years ago and the second one 4 weeks ago. /fun facts!!!
so the summer's here. gotta start preparing the heat apocalypse survival kit. tub of ice cream in the freezer, check.
how about some of this then 
what is that book in the matt and dom pic, why does it look like it says bible?
good night. 
oh hey it's RAH anniversary today.
@Racket @SHOWBlZSYNDROME how dare you
@Racket @SHOWBlZSYNDROME no way this is the best dream i've ever been in. can you do the lucid dream thing and make muse forget starlight?
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @Racket i'm in denial. regarding everything, the gig, time moving fast slow whatever, uno and fury, all that. wtf.
how is it 4 weeks since belfast ;_______;
the only valid excuse for being up so early on a sunday would be if you're at an airport and have an early flight somewhere bc of something
when you work random shifts whenever and weekends lose their meaning it still feels wrong to set your alarm at 7.30 for a sunday morning.
i'm not listening to music that much these days this kind of worries me.
i hope they're still somewhere i¨¨m hungry.
but as it went through the staff door i never saw the box again.... D: :(
we received a massive box of chocolates at work yesterday bc we'd beaten some target
at the end he looked like he got the message.
they had to get morgan and some tech guy to play the drums. matt tried to make the crowd sing, he even invited people on stage.
i dreamt muse played the little stage in my old primary school again. and then suddenly. feeling good. nobody cheered. dom left mid-song :'D
3 tallest guys in the nearby area have lined up in front of me like planets. This is no coincidence. Illuminati.
At the same time trying to process psycho tour, i'm more and more convinced each passing day that it didn't even happen.
Here i am again at SBE. Gonna see archive #soon. Crowd considerably older this time :') no idea who the support band were but DAMN I LIKED.
@hyper_chondriac ikr! it seems anything is indeed possible! but then again it includes stuff like bringing back GL with a light bulb... :::D
@hyper_chondriac OH YES TSP how could i forget that?! D:
@hyper_chondriac one can dream lol
@hyper_chondriac yes. and CE and dead star and a piano section with apocalypse, space dementia etc. assassin needs to become a staple.
@hyper_chondriac yeah! still, if the setlists stay the same i don't care where they play :D
@hyper_chondriac yeah same! although in the end i don't really care as long as i get to see them again and again! :D
i wish gigs and epic things actually cured depression. but no it's still there, making evil plans with reality.
i can't believe muscle museum
there was a new(?) bakery or something in lewisham and the prices looked quite reasonable why didn¨'t i go in and have a closer look?
man i wish i had something sweet. :( a pastry or cake or something.
(i'm not being ungrateful just greedy lol)
i know this is going to sound silly but.... i have only five muse gigs coming up this summer?!?!??! i thought there were more. ;________;
@hyper_chondriac i know! but it just looks so out of place with all the indie coffee shops :'DD
or more like future energy bill crisis
i'm having energy crisis
why use a tumble dryer when you have a massive room where you could just hang your things and they would dry just like that
THE MAINSTREAM IS COMING, HIPSTERS BEWARE!!!!!
there is a costa in new cross, erm okay.....
lol of course i started typing 'muse..' instead of 'myself'
sometimes i do wish i lived by myself or with people as neurotic as me.
and i just can't go and tell grown up people how to do things (my way/CORRECTLY/etc)
soap first and then turn on the tap and rinse, that's what my mother taught me. ._. no unnecessary waste of water.
it may be cultural or just different upbringing or something but why do people just let the tap run ALL THE TIME while doing the dishes?????
punctuation marks are overrated btw
i don't watch reality tv except this finnish show about au pairs it's just the most entertaining for some reason
actually i did feel like a tourist a bit, haven't been in central london for a looooooong time.
judging by the amount of coffee i've had today i can say ive been on holiday.
why do all kinds of weird accounts follow me? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! D:
why are they never in the other person's place anyway why always here get a room (in another house!) ffs
on a lovely day like this young couples should be out having picnics etc NOT hiding in a room giggling and kissing noisily bothering others.
OH MY GODDDDDD YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS #lastRT
stupid election, the results better be good then.
oh fuck it's going to be nearly 20 degrees and sunny tomorrow and i actually have to go out bc i'm going to the finnish embassy to vote. D:
gaaahhhhhh they must bring assassin back for more gigs #AssassinForDownload at least must happen!!! @muse
@hyper_chondriac like this 
if i could morph into anything right now i'd be the microcuts outro riff and just kick ass and destroy everything on my way but it'd be cool
hnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggghhhhhh this band
maybe with a bit better quality this time and some sort of plot ::DD or mayyybe not. meh.
that vid also made me want to edit something :D:D::D maybe i'll try to make another so called documentary of this summer's gigs.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME ikr
i mean 
THAT GOB OUTRO AAAAAAAAHHHH FUCK
also i had forgotten about that assassin or maybe i just didn't realise how bloody amazing it sounded being too busy moshing
@hyper_chondriac I KNOOOOWWWWWWWW i cannot even handle my own existence rn what the fuck is this band what are they doing why
my heart and soul hurt a lot now
i mean FUCKING HELL
i am pretty sure this didnt even happen but 
@hyper_chondriac AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! just watched it too and i just
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac let's make our own video!
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac yeah like this 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 @hyper_chondriac yeah then we have a good excuse at least! "we've rehearsed this so many times you must listen!1"
@maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac yeah next time we meet! we can take turns playing various muse members.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac we have to find them, tell them to wait there until we've all managed to say what we want to say. :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME but probably even scarier on the other hand, you wouldn't be prepred and who knows what would happen... :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah those before/after gig situations were not that good in that sence. bumping into them randomly would be the best
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME awww :D but yeah at least something! when i met chris before itunes fest i literally couldn't get words out of my mouth! :D

it's like everything is starting to sink in and i'm about to freak out
my 11th muse anniversary month was the best thing ever happened in my life.
and 4 weeks ago we had NO IDEA.
plus i can't get over my matt picture
this whole thing is making me extremely giddy now help
couldn't put the thing between the other cd's though i need to be able to see it all the time :D:D:DD
i finally put my abso booklet back in its case! 
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME well actually i've had a proper conversation with tom now that i think of it...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i've managed like max. 2 sentences... :D i always imagined i'd be having intelligent convos with them. yeah, in my dreams.
i want to take a nap but i've got dye in my hair i can't really rest my head anywhere now.
FUCKING HELL newport and exeter were perfect. belfast and brighton too but those two. jesus.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i believe it did! still i don't think it's going to happen if i had to be pushed just to TALK to matt. ::D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME the thing is i'd be too embarrassed :D:D and i don't even like hugging xD
i used to watch this as a kid and little did i know about any ww II propaganda. 
@NoOneWillRecall haha i can imagine, i would be too!
@NoOneWillRecall ahh right! but they are so damn gorgeous i'm sure they're worth it all!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i've only ever shaken hands with them haha.
@NoOneWillRecall where did you get them from/did someone paint them?
what a wonderful day it is to stay indoors! 
@NoOneWillRecall holy shit!!!
i have a huge need to hug them all in reali life though. ;___________;
i just remembered i hugged chris in my dream. :')
it was supposed to be just "have to do this once in my life" thing but i think brighton just encouraged me to queue overnight a bit more. D:
ohhh my gooodddddddddddd why can't it be summer already even if it's going to be hot as fuck i just want more muuuuuuuse *_________*
and of course i'd forgotten to take my absolution thing with me so i could finally have it signed by chris.
a picture. matt only talked to the french girls. and for some reason i'd already met dom in my old home town in finland.
and i nearly cried when i thanked him for the tour and almost screamed something like "ALL MY OLD FAVOURITES" etc and then tried to take
i had a very interesting muse dream again. it was the brighton post gig stalking, and this time i was early enough to meet chris
i miss muse so much.
HEY new orphan black season in a couple of weeks yassssssssss
that was 6 years ago though. but still. ???????????????!!!!!!!!!!
last time i had it it was 60 something??????????
monthly travelcard for zones 2-3 is 93 quid???????????????????
@musclexmuseum woahh
@musclexmuseum i just meant the weather haha.
@musclexmuseum here it's too bloody hot let's swap.
all the sweet and chocolatey easter things better be very cheap today.
but i have to go to work =) and theyll prob send me home early bc no money but can afford to get someone from another shop to cover my shift
and to japan.
i want a cat and i want to go to iceland.
waahhhhhh 
i just remembered there will be a psycho tour dvd i hope they include all the oldies and crowd reactions :D:D:D
@hyper_chondriac maybe it'll end up on the dvd :D
bloody hell my handwriting was so good 11 years ago, i can actually read it.
@maja1985 haha yeah that was the only thing i was pretty good at. but meeting matt still shocked me. :D:D
YOU JUST WAIT 10 YEARS 364 DAYS AND THE VERY THING HAPPENS. :')))))))
..just be in a shock so it'd all go wrong. =)" :DDDD YOU JUST WAIT
english is important. "otherwise i will never be able to say anything to matthew bellamy. but even though i had the chance i'd probably..
21st march 2004: stressing about school projects and things. grades don't matter as long as i pass all the courses. except english.
yes i'm probably going to cite the entirety of my youth here.
"oh no i only had time to listen to absolution ONCE today! :/" 13th march 2004. :')))
you just wait.
and i'm trying to deny my matt fangirling like omg this is such a teenager thing!!11 lol i surely wasn't a teenager at 17, so mature. =)))
i've been a muse fan for a week and i'm writing "at some point you realise some people have seen muse live and i haven't! that is so wrong."
my old diaries are the most entertaining thing i'm telling you
@hyper_chondriac i still find it so difficult to believe!!
@hyper_chondriac haha i didn't see that i was too busy screaming like an idiot :DD
well that only required 58 gigs. so maybe showbiz happens sometime in the next life???
but MM always had the potential (despite of the stupid pedal excuse...) and i've always wanted to see it live. so so bad.
although futurism in newport was the closest to make me cry but i never even in my wildest dreams thought they'd bring THAT back. or uno.
i don't think i've ever (or at least for a loooong time) been as happy as in exeter when muse played muscle museum. *__________________*
i want something. food. sweets. cakes. everything. something.
@lastsmindy en vielä sinne asti tiiä mut ilimotan sitten kun!
@hyper_chondriac what is this real world you're talking about :O
and fury and now i've seen them all.
browsing my good old finnish muse mb and found some dream setlists of mine from 2005-08, funny how they include songs like uno &amp; agitated
@hyper_chondriac haha they just need more practise!
bet you wish you could be spending your easter in finland. :) :) :) 
@hyper_chondriac yeah :D and it is!!! but i just wish they did the middle part in the middle, and with the singing as well! but whatever. :D
@hyper_chondriac such a relief, i knew they couldn't abandon the middle part forever! the original is still my favourite though. ;____;
@hyper_chondriac yeah that summer was a ~game changer~ for me, realising i don't need to like everything they do. :D assassin GOB edit was
@hyper_chondriac yeah same. i've never been too fond of starlight, it was quite nice in bhar era but i could easily live without it. :D
@hyper_chondriac but i was actually a bit disappointed with smbh. :D and very upset how exo politics and assassin studio versions turned out
@hyper_chondriac invincible was one of my faves on BHAR when it came out! now i'm a bit bored of it but take it over GL/NSC etc any day!
@hyper_chondriac or undisclosed desires
@hyper_chondriac i actually liked NSC when it came out. :D i think guiding light was the start of all things bad.
hmm it's easter and i don't have easter eggs??????! ? !
@hyper_chondriac yeah, too bad they started writing some crap songs :p
not that hanging out with my sister/muse people has been unpleasant but i just can't handle too much socialising without a break.
for the first time in ages i have no social contact with other irl human beings scheduled!!!!!!!! aaahhhhhh an entire day just for me.
i don't normally deserve nice things but i'd like to think i've deserved my day off today, 1st since forever when i have no plans at all.
@hyper_chondriac could be that some people are still going through the "muse can't do anything wrong!!11" phase, i had that too.. :DD
3 weeks since belfast...
i forgot that things like madness and resistance exist.
ohhhh god i'm going to be so screwed. the worst thing is asking my parents for a LOT of money.
but then muse feels good. &lt;3________________&lt;3
...or both, but trying to meditate just made me cry and feel even more exhausted/sad or something.
idk if pms or the fact that i'm super exhausted after the muse tour (still!) and working non stop literally as soon as my holiday was over..
@musclexmuseum ass belongs to me now
@assielina hesarista on tullu pelottavan paljon iltalehdempi.
and what do i do in this grim financial situation? buy some discount cakes of course! now only comfort food and the simpsons can save me.
hours are being cut at work. got to go home 2.5hrs earlier today. so long 15 quid didn't need you anyway.
scooter broke mid way my journey to work (in the rain as well!), rent going up, bills devided between 4 people now instead of 5.
@assielina ...... mitä helevettiä
has my R&amp;L origin t-shirt always been so small? D:
@Racket i actually meant someone buying milk in a shop but close enough!!
or probably had already happened. but anyway.
hey wasn't it two weeks ago when things happened in exeter.
i wish i had a two day weekend.



This is fun.
•A trans man is not a woman
•Trans women do not 'trick' men
•Do not justify the murder of trans…
Holy shit i've never seen such a crowd!!! And how happy it made the band. :')
If at a gig i'm not on the barrier there will ALWAYS be the tall dude in front of me. Always.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME thanks!
@musclexmuseum i saw them at glasto last year and my mind was blown! They should support muse one day that would be perfect.
@musclexmuseum yes i am indeed! And i know, it's my 3rd time seeing them! :D
Fans of wolf alice seem awfully young!
Just found a strange new cafe/pizza place. Stupid rain made me wander in and now i had to order a tea for nearly 3 quid. D:
I wish there was a bus to shepherd's bush from canada water.
Went to work 1h earlier hoping for more money but had to finish earlier too. And now i've got an hour to kill before i can travel. Fuck yes.
@muse @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard oh and if you could also bring back new born that'd be grand cheers :):):)
well at least i managed to grab download train tickets for £28! man this is stupid. i want to be rich.
yo @muse i'm spending all my money on the summer festivals the least you can do is play showbiz @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard
AND there's free food. mmmmmm airplane food.
so i'm going to have to go for that thing then. well at least i can take the tube from heathrow and don't have to pay £20 for airport travel
oh bugger why is the outbound flight so cheap when looking for a round trip but on it's own it's like double the price???? fuck this.
what would i do without twitter, id have to talk my travel plans out loud, by myself. (which i'm doing anyway.)
breakfast included though eh????
meh hostels in luxembourg are expensive as fuck though D:
hmm fuck i so want to book this now! i'd have a couple of days to be a tourist in luxembourg too! and with BA you'd get a free snack. :::D
and some ads are telling me icelandair flies to canada for like £400 return aaargggh stupid lotto numbers y u never match :(((((
but money. which i don't have at all atm.
but the flight times are so convenient omg :DD:D:D i'm very tempted now.
hmm now i found a roundtrip from _heathrow_ for 80 quid its not THAT bad but the bus would have been 40 something. :/
"Unfortunately, on the bus there are no free seats." yeah right.
oh fuck off they cancelled my london-luxembourg bus booking!
bloody hell i miss muse. ;______________; still 56 days....
he said theyll definitely try. dream over now i think.
recording of me talking to matt and dom at the exeter gig, i thanked them for the gig/tour and asked dom to keep futurism in the setlist
and he was like "oh we've been filming many things". i didn't get any more tickets anywhere. in another part of the dream there was a
some street and as the general sale started i noticed muse's camera crew was there too and i shouted to tom "why are you filming this agony"
i'm not a robot. and then i had to bake a pizza and that was that?? and for the general sale a lot of people with their laptops were out on
to grab a ticket for the swedish gig (in göteborg!) which was a bit of a pain as i had to answer all kinds of unrelated questions to prove
tickets to the finnish gig and i'd completely missed the presale. my sister had an extra ticket though which was good and somehow i managed
then i had to force myself to wake up because i panicked. but in the other dream the very thing was happening for real. and everyone had got
i had a dream within my dream that psycho eu tour was announced. and it included the nordic countries, helsinki (tavastia!!!) in september.
and then i decided sugar is a good thing i should not keep myself away from it. :)))
i bought cheesecake. all day at work i kept thinking about sweet sugary chocolatey fatty things and i cracked.
the noise coming from my flatmate's room sounds like the electrical buzz you can hear near power lines. there's no one there, i'm scared. D:
still haven't gone full 24h without anything sweet though let's see how i get through this haha.
i just went to the supermarket and didn't buy anything sweet! same thing yesterday. look at me fighting the sugar addiction.
@monsieurbellamy congrats!!!
"the front row is pretty much the same people every gig" lol
how the hell did miss the triple j dead inside premiere interview.
and loads of caffeine right now.
i want muse there too. ;____;
aw man kasabian at sziget, they played before muse in 2010.
as much fun as it's been sleeping on my sister's sofa or the weird megabus bunk beds i can't describe how good my own bed feels rn. :')))
gahh why is it still nearly two months until more muse. ;__________________;
@hyper_chondriac @muse ooh that would be the greatest thing cheers :D
@hyper_chondriac @muse bloody hell, where?! i need to get one!!!
@hyper_chondriac @muse omg want
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME belfast didn't have starlight! :D i think that was probably the only gig ever...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac yeah true. but still the best thing to do is just never to play it again. :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac i love it on the album but it's seen its best live days, origin era at least did some justice to it.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac they might squeeze feeling good in, it's only 3 minutes!(or is it? felt like forever on stadium tour. o_o)
the light is confusing me, and now the darkness too, how is it half past 8?!?!?!?
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac or they just cut other rarities and other good things and still keep starlight. :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac aaaaargggh me too! but will they really use 20mins of the set for just CE and the globalist... :::D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac any way is fine for me tbh *_____________*
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME i can't ~handle~ the fact that the handler has something to do with showbiz they HAVE TO bring it back now
i just realised i've seen the ENTIRE origin live twice. that's including the japanese bonus track. yooooo.
i want that album NOW.
reading the q article hhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggg
if they are aprill fooling me now im going to punch someone. most likely myself for believing.
thanks for letting me know so early. =)))
apparently i'm supposed to be working today???? they just called me while i was on the bus home that i was expected to start half 9???
Holy shit this is an actual night bus as in we got little hammock beds!!! :D never travelled with any of these! I'm scared.
meh i don't want holiday to be over :( after these past few weeks i don't think i can handle reality very well.
well technically i could have just gone there earlier but felt lazy and ended up watching a movie with my sister haha.
there is an observatory in dundee with free to use telescopes and of course the only night the skies are clear is tonight when i'm leaving.
@musclexmuseum hihi thank you :')
@hyper_chondriac same. ;___; i've been on holiday so haven't really thought about it that much but now that i uploaded my photos i just..
as much as i love fashion and clothes and things that farm job was still the best one i ever had. i want to have my own garden.
and it was so nostalgic i used to work in a greenhouse the summer bhar came out. :')))
i went to dundee botanic gardens and it was snowing. greenhouses were nice.

@muse #drones
@musclexmuseum in the early 00s they suddenly started playing quite well, at least they always won against finland :D
@musclexmuseum oh nice! :D i went to see a couple of games in finland in 2003, one of them was finland against slovakia and we lost 5-1 ::D
@musclexmuseum cool we can have the conversation in the next queue then! :D  hockey used to be the biggest thing in my life in the late 90s
also in another dream i was talking about ice hockey with @musclexmuseum and some people from slovakia and canada and other hockey coutries.
and i was a bit gutted.
and no one knew if it was real but there were songs like instant messenger &amp; demo stuff and some new ones. and KOC started and TAB finished.
but in the end i could have made it but i didn't know where the place was and started panicking and then just followed the gig on setlist.fm
i had a dream i was going to see muse in exeter but i was late or something and decided fuck it im just not going then.
gahh wanted to upload some psycho tour pics on fb but this connection......
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac let's hope they'll just do another setlist poll or something.
@hyper_chondriac don't even...!
@hyper_chondriac @Racket @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @maja1985 ahh that would be perfect :DD
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @Racket @maja1985 i just need to wait until the next payday! :::D
didn't even realise it's a week since brighton, a week since i met matt and dom. ;_________;
@musclexmuseum wtf i can't believe it's been a week. o___o
@Racket @maja1985 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac why all this do we have a reason to panic??? i hope it'll indeed be 4 wks at least. :D
@maja1985 i'm just flying on the muse day, lisbon is so much cheaper so might as well stay one more night there.
@maja1985 ridiculous innit! i didn't book any accommodation, just going to spend the night at the festival i guess... :D
tomorrow evening also a chance of snow and rain and all that i wonder how slippery my bus ride back to london will be... ::::D
same sort of gusts happening in scotland as well but i guess here it's a normal thing bc no weather warnings issued?? :D
wtf london?! 
i've been in dundee for nearly 3 days and only now realised this is where knights of cydonia got its world premiere.
@hyper_chondriac ahh i already forgot about that! aftermath is such a good song title imo, i hope it's not ruined by too much cheese! :D
@hyper_chondriac ikr and especially if/when they do psycho eu tour they might premiere some more stuff,and at festivals the latest for sure
@hyper_chondriac then putting it on and being excited....!! and then going wtf because it has stuff like GL or big freeze on it. ::D
@hyper_chondriac yeah true.i didn't want to listen to the T2L stream bc i just love the feeling of having the actual album in your hands and
@hyper_chondriac i know!!! i think with this album i might finally have to give in to temptation and even listen to the actual album leak..
@hyper_chondriac i think it's too difficult now that we're so depended on the interwebs and you just can't avoid people raving on about it..
@hyper_chondriac i just finished downloading! :D just in case..
@hyper_chondriac it's still on youtube.... :D
@hyper_chondriac bloody hell, to me that is a lot. D: oh well, i hope i win lotto/euromillions next week. :DD
@hyper_chondriac yeah me too i've got too many ideas! :D but first i want that absolution shadow. but no money for that sort of thing. :(
@Racket ikr spent almost all of my muse fund on this uk tour and now i need to use the rest to pay rent D: but can't not go to EUtour either
@Racket yesss #ShowbizForEveryone and they must know by now everyone wants it. they'd better have started rehearsing!!!
@Racket i'm hoping for that to happen to me with showbiz.
defector sounds very showbiz-y-old-musey *_______________*
i want a muse tattoo so bad.
i'm feeling too many silly things today anyway like i just want to hang out with them or something. @muse why are we not friends?
why still two months until some more live muse ;____________;
waaaaaaaaahhhhhh
@maja1985 haha good :D
it has that riff :'))))) and the slide thign
hoooooly shit i'm 3 and a half minutes in already 8)))))))))))) fucks sake this stupid band
@maja1985 i thought you were always coming anyway?? :D
aaaaaaaaaaaahhahahaaaaa come ooonnnnnnn internet ;_____________; why now
fuck why such bad connectio i want to watch thatt thign
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i don't even remember :D yeah def going to give it a go.
2 weeks since belfast how????? 2 months until münchen how???
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME haha i think wasn't impressed with the 1st single from that so i couldn¨t even be bothered... ::D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah i haven't really listened to anything since sleeping with ghosts properly :D i really like the newest one though!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME but you know, muse tiredness. :D i really enjoyed the gig although i didn't know half the setlist haha.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME nah i had a seat. :D although it made me almost fall asleep at one point D: not bc the gig was boring, it wasn't!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME haha yeah i did indeed! the one on 25th. and you??
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME HEY i went to see placebo in london a couple of days ago! ??!?!
@lastsmindy no voiham pylly! D: mitä sää kesäkuun alussa, kerkeetkö sinne wienin festarille ees mitenkään??
imagine if they brought showbiz and CE back =)))
hooooooooooooly shit i can't wait for that fucking album now!!!!!!!

Lyrics in The Handler hark back to Showbiz (the song)

The Globalist = film music+…
The Globalist is film-music, metal and piano. Thanks @ANDREW0675 htt…
@lastsmindy ???? ;________;
Matt's voice is a funny thing; whenever i'm listening to it i feel like i'm home and safe and all that but at the same time it hurts my soul
And may i just say HOLY SHIT FURY ETERNALLY MISSED AND SPIRAL STATIC. *_________* I want EM live please.
And the stupid megabus wifi didn't even work lol! But anyway nice passing lake district listening to origin and hullabaloo. Dreamy.
This is well annoying. Also why glasgow out of all the places muse played here just last week and i wasn't there. ;_____;
I was supposed to arrive in dundee in the next 15 minutes or so but stuck in glasgow bc of M6 and a fucking psycho on the bus earlier.
off to scotland i am then
@GypsyJaeger awwww ;___;
@glenrowe @muse it's the 4th day without a small muse show, this doesn't feel right. still waiting for a london one... ;)
got my stuff packed and was all eady to go and then realised i've still got one more hour! ::D well this is nice for a change.
i love muse so much.
i hope the bus is not completely packed tomorrow, i need to have some space for my work station.
what do you pack for a normal trip that doesn't include queuing
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME aahh right. but it is cute!!!
matt being 'quite a cat person' is making me a lot more happier than it probably should.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME flipping hell 10 pounds is a bit too much! but as i said, when i'm rich....
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME aw man when i'm rich i'm going to get myself one! :D i love plushy animals!!! and alpacas!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME I WANT
bliss &lt;3___________&lt;3
now i'm going to be sad when they announce the european thing bc i cannot go, i'll have to use the remaining muse fund to pay rent ;_______;
well something shitty was just bound to happen after all that amazing epicness that was the psycho tour.
they are such greedy bastards.
and i'm sure the rent is going to increase a lot more than what my landlady said now that she's going to talk to the agency oh fuuucckk
fffuuccking hell i've literally spent all my salary in one day. o________o paying off muse debts.
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME ..afford to stay in bilbao (even the cheapest hostels like 30 quid wtf...) so i'm arriving on the muse day
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME but of course if you're planning to go to bilbao earlier idk maybe the prices are different, i can't..
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME i booked one for £72, on july 11, arrives in bilbao before midday. found it on ebookers, try that!
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah i think i'm going to book all my stuff too now that the ticket's finally booked...
and just pull an all nighter at the bbk festival :::D
hot damn found a hostel in lisbon for under tenner per night! bilbao still expensive as fuck so that's it gonna stay in lisbon for 3 days
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac last time i checked lisbon-bilbao flights were like 70 quid and probably a lot more expensive byt now.. D:
@hyper_chondriac yay! i got mine on seetickets...
muse though! #lastRT
now i'm sure i bought it for the wrong day but aaaaaahhh what the hell muuuuuuuse!!!!!
bilbao day ticket, check!!!
@maja1985 NEVERMIND  FOUND IT AAAHH
@maja1985 help where i can't find anything anywhere
@maja1985 WHAAAATT no omg i hope theyre not all gone yet
if this is a dream which it most likely is please never wake me up.
holy shit i STILL CAN'T BELIEVE i actually saw muse at such small venues and those setlists
ooh it's going to be nice and chilly (and windy as fuck!) in dundee!
it's going to be so weird to be travelling somewhere and knowing there won't be a muse gig waiting for me. ;______;
plenty of time for both of those things tomorrow though, 10 hour bus ride to scotland!
i need to sort out my tour photos and post some on fb but i just want to sleeeeeeeeeeppp
i love that guitar *________* #lastRT
@DaniDiveney it is i know!! and general sale started only 2 weeks ago..?! feels like the past fortnight happened in another dimension...
well if someone would have told me about 4 months ago i would soon meet owen pallett and matt bellamy.. i don't even know.
seems like being ill is becoming our family holiday tradition.......
oh man my sister just messaged me she's got the flu! i'm supposed to go and visit her tomorrow.
@DaniDiveney whaaatt has it been a week already?!
@hyper_chondriac hey let me know your paypal email address so i can transfer you the money for the ticket, finally got paid!
paydaaaaayyyyyyyyyy! hello money. oh, goodbye money.
wwwwwhhhhy is that even a thing...................... #lastRT absolutely disgusting.
stefan looked jävla fin
all the nostalgia though :')))

didn't expect placebo to play that kate bush cover!! but then again i don't follow their setlists or anything so i dont know what i expected
i actually just fell asleep on my feet on the train.
And i nearly fell asleep at one point. ::D sleep deprivation is real.
And everything. Although i didn't even recognise half of the set. Sounded bloody amazing. And loud.
Shit son i should be seeing placebo more often. The bitter end. *_____*
Aww man placebo fans still look like muse fans did 10 years ago. :')
so why do i listen
marmozets will now be one of those bands i just can't listen to without feeling empty afterwards because muse aren't on next.
@musclexmuseum indeed! :O
also my desk seems to be falling apart. like my soul. &lt;/3&lt;/3&lt;/3
i dont think i'll be able to concentrate.
i'm supposed to be seeing placebo tonight for the first time ever FINALLY but what's going to happen with all these muse feels.
just wish i had chris' signature there as well then it would be perfect. (well at least i've got two of them already :D)
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL NOW ;_________; 
@musclexmuseum i knooowww &lt;333________________&lt;333 i feel so giddy this is stupid.
@musclexmuseum indeed! but whatever i don't care as long as i just get to see them again.&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;333
well that hashtag just somehow guaranteed that 'duff beer for me, duff beer for you' will be stuck in my head for the rest of the evening.
my next muse gig will be my 60th. they should totally play showbiz. =) #ShowbizForMe =)))
@musclexmuseum i think they enjoyed it so much they'll def play small venues again! now let's just hope we'll be as lucky with tickets again
@musclexmuseum i knoooooww i'm so happy they actually take the time to talk to people and take pics etc! dom stayed for a long time too.
@musclexmuseum haha he actually looked a bit more confused/surprised/usual matt. i'm surprised i managed to squeeze through all the people!
didn't really need this now.
rent increase yaaaaassssssss
i've got coconut flakes everywhere on my keyboard letters are missing when i type fast
"could you sign this one for me please" probably said it in exactly the same voice i do at work as well ::D
i just realised i asked dom to sign my abso booklet like a tru retail salesperson asking customer's signature for a refund receipt ::::::D
@musclexmuseum "thank you for the tour it was amazing" something like that. and I KNOW that feeling i had the same when i met chris in 2012.
and why did chris leave too early ;________; waaaaaahhhhh fuck this band
why did morgan disapear so quickly though where did he even go i would have loved a picture with him :D
i love those idiots
and dom's grinning face when he needed a sharpie and i gave him mine ut he'd already got one and gave me mine back and grinned.&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;33
and i said an entire sentence to both of them. without too much trouble. matt's silly face&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;333
all day today i've just been thinking about those post gig moments in brighton. and the fact i actually talked to matt and dom.
i can feel some fangirling happening in the near future.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac @maja1985 @musclexmuseum ;_____________; &lt;/3
F-U-T-U-R-I-S-M-!-!-!!!!-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *__________________________*
oh hello credit card bill not so nice to see you.
it's going to be somethig bad i can feel it. after all this muse thing there's just no other way.
my landlady wants to see me today she didn't say what about now i'm worried. :/
well i must admit dead inside is damn catchy.
hey @muse thank you so much for the psycho tour, it was a dream come true. &lt;3 love you. @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard
yeeesss sounds like a plan.
i think i'm going to make a playlist consisting of uno, fury, futurism, assassin, muscle museum and the groove and listen to that and cry.
did they really play muscle museum?????????
no but seriously how do you deal with the fact that the tour is over.
@hyper_chondriac we do indeed! yesterday the barrier at least was really into it. :')
@hyper_chondriac @Takeabow_19 i do hope they realise that. :D i'm a bit worried, i mean starlight stuck on the setlists after belfast...
listened to the live version of dead inside again and it's better. still the song's a bit uneventful. :/
@Takeabow_19 @hyper_chondriac omg :D tbh i wouldn't even be surprised...
@hyper_chondriac or madness.
feels really weird to do ordinary things when less than 24 hours ago i talked to matt and dom.
although the last one might be replaced with a massive post muse blues now. but hello again the favourite part of my day.
it's been a long time since i had an evening with the simpsons, food, cake and no muse tour stress!
#ShowbizForDownload #ShowbizForRockavaria #ShowbizForFestivals #ShowbizForEveryone
fucking hell muse only u can stop the pain &lt;/3 &lt;/3 &lt;/3 &lt;/3 &lt;/3
but whateverr &lt;333&lt;3&lt;3
muse should just lyrically stick to silly over the top politics/conspiracy stuff/aliens. :DD
need me some psycho
live version was ok otherwise this just feels like a UD/madness mash up. so neither of them better show up in setlists now that this will...
meh.
i guess i should probably listen to dead inside with proper headphones...
@hyper_chondriac one of my least favourite words in human language ever. D: besides it makes me think of that pig.
i'm supposed to see placebo tomorrow i'm sure i'll forget.
@hyper_chondriac @musclexmuseum oh well at least that saves me some money : D
I've got 7616 tracks on my mp3 player. I put it on shuffle and what comes on first but futurism. World i think u trying to rip my soul apart
@musclexmuseum 2 months is ages considering 2 weeks ago we didn't even know psycho tour would happen. ;_______;
66 days until rockavaria how do you deal with that ;_________________;
at home and having my morning coffee and then work in one hour????? reality can't you just bloody wait a bit.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac haha indeed! &lt;3 &lt;/3 ;_________; i can't do those fancy yellow emojis but yeah. FEELS!!!!!
@hyper_chondriac exactly, this is muse we're talking about so i know i'm going to be wrong :DD but what the hell. love the idea of it anyway
@musclexmuseum what lol are they still not going to release physical singles???
srsly though, 6 gigs and uno, fury, hyper music, agitated, futurism, the groove, muscle museum, assassin, dead star??? now that's the spirit
really i should get going now. my shift starts in 4 and a half hours before that i need to get back to london and take a shower and eat.
and see the reaction.
i would like to go back 11 years now and tell that 17yo person one day you'll meet matt twice and see things such as uno, MM, the groove etc
@hyper_chondriac yeah probably. but anyway i love psycho and reapers to bits and have VERY high expectations of the globalist! :D:D:D
i can't believe i met (2/3 of) muse in fucking brighton?!!??! ::::D on the streets i always hang around.
hey @muse #ShowbizForFestivals then ok @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard @Nowherethomas @CaptMorganized @glenrowe @domanderson666
man i'm glad i don't have to queue today it's a bit wet out there.
they've still got some barriers hanging about at the dome ;______; 
other than that meh... now let's see if this grows on me at all :D
what makes me cringe the most is the fact that the title of the song is sung in the beginning.
@musclexmuseum ikr.....
matt's voice sounds so weird in that ablaze and alive bit
@hyper_chondriac well i certainly did! :D oh well.....
still in brighton, i'm sure i'm not going to get back to london in time...
@musclexmuseum @MattBellamy they will bc i'm not going to be able to make it to any.
@musclexmuseum @MattBellamy unless there are promo shows in europe which there probably will be ;____;
where do i put all these feels
i have to be at work in 12 hours????????????????
@hyper_chondriac @SHOWBlZSYNDROME haha no, i don't think we're THAT close. :D
what is muse and why
and why did matt walk away when i tried to ask about showbiz
i don't think i can handle anything right now
WHHHAAATTT i totally missed that 10 minute thing ho shit #lastRT also dom just told a fan it's his favourite from drones.
it was a lot better live though. still the weakest one of the new ones so far. oh what the hell.
okay lol at dead inside lyric video and lyrics :D::DD so it's kinda like UD 2.0, i can totally see this one on the playlist at work.. .::::D
@LinaBellamy because my camera is crap :D and the most important thing for me was to just say thank you. +i've already got pics with them.
@LinaBellamy didn't take any i'm afraid!
(also how funny that @hyper_chondriac and @SHOWBlZSYNDROME happen to be staying next door :D:D:D)
EMOTIONS &lt;3_________________________&lt;3
THIS MOTHERFUCKING BAND
PLEASE DON'T GO I LOVE YOU SO ;___________________;
And asked glen about london dates and he said london's had its fair share. Got dom to sign my abso booklet too.
OH MY FUCKING GOD met matt and dom and managed to thank them for the tour
Yay the groove! And uno again! I refuse to believe it's over now. :(
I think i spotted chris and ava watching marmozets at the side of the stage.
@noonewillrecall barrier? Did your door open later or why did it seem it was just our queuers here when got in?
@noonewillrecall i'm barrier approx between dom &amp; chris, don't know about @musclexmuseum i just tweeted her as well. And you?
@musclexmuseum where did you guys end up? Looked like your door took longer. D:
@hyper_chondriac YES although  it didn't seem so sure anymore once the doors opened lol. And omg, i couldn't make out a thing matt said!!!
Hmm interesting! Can't wait to hear this live! (still hoping for #ShowbizForBrighton too though @muse )
We're going to listen to dead inside premiere here :')))
@G0ld3nE4gl3 everyone pushed and ticket scanning/wristband persons were slow as fuck! Really badly organised.
So it doesn't really make a difference if you beat the regular french in the queue, they'll still end up in their spot.
What an absolutely fucking ridiculous entry! Made barrier chris side tho!
as much as i'm going to miss the gigs i'm so glad all the waiting and queuing will soon be over.
lol a couple of hours freezing my arse off and for nothing.
Tom!
Morgan is here!
twitter y u no sending me notifications
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME idk i'm just speculating. :D gonna go back there now and see what's up.
queue looks empty from here is stage door happening already
my face is burning.
@musclexmuseum @maja1985 hmmmm! :D but idk other people might. oh well i'll see. i'm really tempted though haha.
why am i so nervous about this thing i'm actually shaking
@musclexmuseum @maja1985 i don't know! i thought there was only going to be one queue at the other door and well it's too late to move now:D
@maja1985 it wouldn't if there was only one door! :( but yeah hopefully i'm stressing over nothing... thanks!
@maja1985 i just hope the ticketmaster people magically appear and everyone'll get their tickets and be in the right order...
@maja1985 idk i just don't have such good luck :D this past week has been absurd enough... Plus i have a feeling there will be queue jumpers
@maja1985 yeah i'm not going to take a bag either. I'm just so sure my card won't work and everyone will get in front of me...
@maja1985 i'm 6 and got here at midnight but i have a feeling it will be a chaos, my card won't work, other queue will be faster etc...
.@muse better play showbiz then #ShowbizForBrighton
Fucking hell no pre scanning and both doors will open. D: The one time i'm within the first 10 people it's going to be all screwed up... :/
fucks sake this queue thing is stressing me out!!!
One security guy tells us he absolutely guarantees the 1st queuers go in 1st and the other one says both doors are opening too bad for you.
@hyper_chondriac yeah as long as the ticket stuff goes well i should be alright i guess! See you!
@hyper_chondriac thank you! I'll be stressed as fuck though even with such a low number! xD
Apparently yesterday they didn't print tickets beforehand i'm so worried now. D:
@hyper_chondriac or like my friend said, usually general people queue at one door and the other is for VIPs etc...
@hyper_chondriac there are 2 but now everyone's at one, i guess the other will be for seats??
@delilah_1982 @MattBellamy ahh yes maybe if i manage to catch them before the gig :DD
@delilah_1982 @MattBellamy sounds like a plan! although not sure how security would react to it, don't want to be removed from the venue! :D
@hyper_chondriac yeah a couple. but i'm number 6 at least (i was 4 at my door but now i think the queues have been combined into one??)
damn i should have brought my sign.
so @MattBellamy needs some convincing..... Bananas for Showbiz perhaps????? #ShowbizForBrighton
@hyper_chondriac hope i can at least manage a thank you. i've been queuing since 0:15 :D now having brekkie at my friend's&amp;then heading back
@hyper_chondriac haha cool! :D see you after the gig then, i want meet them again too! i just don't know what to say but what the hell.
what is happening in the queue now it looks like everyone's been moved to one door help i'm still having my breakfast
spying on the queue. 
matt has five cats though??????????????? ^______________________________^
yo @muse #ShowbizForBrighton @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard @Nowherethomas @CaptMorganized @glenrowe @domanderson666
but hey at least i survived the night. never again..... or maybe when it's warmer haha.
also how the hell are people able to actually  talk to them, i don't get it.
everyone who met muse last night talked about their hair??? :'DDDD
@maja1985 yay!
@hyper_chondriac ohh my goddd you finally met him!!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Ooh one tour bus is parked here...
Can't believe i've been here for about an hour?! Number 4 at my door. :')
@musclexmuseum there are 6 people now!
am i really going to do this oh god.
@musclexmuseum i think i'm going soon there are people already there
@PaulGRyan @EpicLastSong oh that's good then. :D
fucking hell i knew i couldn't beat them
they're taking pictures now
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @Racket yep.
i bet it's the french and they're securing their number 1 spots at both doors aaarggh i don't want to go now they will beat me up. D:
dammit just when i was about to take a little nap!
i think the queuing has begun D: i can see people hanging around the entrances and they are def not some regular people just walking by.
now #ShowbizForBrighton @muse @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard @Nowherethomas @CaptMorganized @glenrowe pretty please.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yes true.
@laura_markus @SHOWBlZSYNDROME and i will thank you.
@laura_markus @SHOWBlZSYNDROME showbiz #ShowbizForBrighton
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME or that!
@laura_markus @SHOWBlZSYNDROME showbiz
wouldn't mind seeing hyper music again tbh!
i should probaly try to sleep for a bit...
so all that matters now is #ShowbizForBrighton
for some reason i'm not too bothered about the setlist??? i mean wow the groove etc, and songs in different places and all but no showbiz.
so it was real then??
man i was almost hoping it would be real :::D
so that must mean #ShowbizForBrighton
i assume the one hidden under the cable is uprising
if that setlist is real wow
don't think there's anyone yet, at least there wasn't when i walked by when i arrived...
i can see the dome from my friend's living room window. :'))))) 
tbh i don't give a flying fuck if they play the groove and dead star and shit i just want showbiz tomorrow. #ShowbizForBrighton
@musclexmuseum yeah of course!
@musclexmuseum haha not really, i think i'll be there around the same time as you!
@musclexmuseum well that's a relief! :D makes me want to go earlier and earlier though...
@musclexmuseum oh cool! I just got on the bus and it's absolutely packed i'm being crushed by my camping equipment! :D any queue yet? D:
There's a guy on this train who sounds like matt i'm scared.
@musclexmuseum just got on train in east croydon! Missed the direct one so prob going to take the bus from 3 bridges. You on your way yet?
eeeek about to leave for brighton!!! gonna be ages until i'm there but what the hell.
and now i'm only going to brighton :'DDDDD oh god why.
i'm sure i've packed a lot less for my week long muse trips in europe. 
i am laughing at my rucksack
@musclexmuseum yes see you :D
@musclexmuseum oh i see! so you're probably taking a southern train then? hm i guess i'll just see what i do when i actually get off my arse
@musclexmuseum aahh hmm. are you leaving from victoria or london bridge? or blackfriars??
@musclexmuseum so yeah i don't know :'DD depends on which one i can catch.
@musclexmuseum idk yet, i have to take a bus to east croydon bc of engineering works, then i think there are direct trains only 1 in an hour
i still refuse to believe it costs £19 when on a weekday it could be a fiver????
and nearly 2 hours to brighton?!?!?!? damn you southern....
i should probably start making my way though it's going to take ages to get to croydon with the replacement bus.
i think i'm going to take my laptop with me to brighton so i'm not going to be that much out of the loop lol
@musclexmuseum aw man! yeah do it haha!
i want to listen to muscle museum but not sure what would happen
#ShowbizForEveryone i like that
@musclexmuseum london day travel card?? do they still exist? get an oyster card so you'll always pay the cheapest fare!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah i already voted! :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah you just have to keep walking straight down from the station and at some point turn left. i'm sure there are signs.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @CTWolstenholme yeah bring back showbiz as a staple!!! #ShowbizForBrighton
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME well they played fucking futurism twice in a row so maybe there's hope...! we just have to hashtag the fuck out of it.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME aahh right. yeah you can walk, it's maybe 10-15 minutes from the station. i always walkk everywhere in brighton. :D
they're so gonna play showbiz tonight i can feel it in my bones. ;______; and brighton's rarity/surprise/whatever will be dead inside.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME change trains/buses a million times and for some reason it costs twice as much as it usually does. D:
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME normally london to brighton isn't that bad but if you're travelling on sunday there are engineering works and you have to
pls????????
can i get #ShowbizForBrighton ???????
hey bots can i get free money if i mention iphone again???
the stupid wnb iphone messaging bubble thing???? /problems.
the fuck's happened with fb, i can't access messages from the side bar anymore(and everything else has disappeared too) do i now have to use
oh god i think i have to use my muse fund to pay bills next month :::D my holiday money is not appearing on my payslip yet!
self preservation probably. :DDD
when i got my first matt handshake it kinda woke up the 17-year old  fangirl in me, i wonder why it hasn't happened now???????
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @musclexmuseum exactly! she kept begging and begging though. the security gave it to a disabled guy in the end, v nice!
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME yep. but at least the security guy didn't let the french girl keep the drumstick!:D but yeah it'll be savage
@musclexmuseum @SHOWBlZSYNDROME  i'm actually a bit scared. D: one girl got bitten by one of them in newport for getting a drumstick.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @musclexmuseum wouldn't mind if they just played it fair and wouldn't be so bloody violent!
@musclexmuseum i think that's what they did with newport and exeter.
great, just as i thought, some of the french will skip manc and go to brghton straightaway. aarrggh never going to beat them in queuing!!!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac @maja1985 let's start a campaign/hashtag/something! :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME but i didn't even dare to ask him to join us when we were taking pictures with dom xD that was so weird.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME chris was there too but he kind of stepped back and looked like he didn't want to be bothered. i shook his hand though too.
hey internet it's so nice to see you again but i should be getting some queuing food ad heading to brighton.
hey @maja1985 and @hyper_chondriac good luck with meeting chris!!! :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME in 2007 after my first muse gig. ::::D then i just asked him "CAN I AT LEAST SHAKE YOUR HAND?!??!1" lol
man it feels amazing having slept 11 hours and eating properly and having coffee???
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME ..airport check in queue with them holding their passports and luggage etc but anyway i'm traumatised :DD
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME when i met dom for the 1st time my sis asked for a hug and he said "i can't do that", i think it was bc it was at a...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah i can't actually imagine dom hugs tbh :DD but matt and chris!&lt;3 anyway i'd be too embarrassed to ask for a hug.
first need to learn to behave like a human in front of them.
mustn't get greedy but fucking hell i really want to hug muse. but that would be like step 34865498545 in my muse meeting plan.
and in that dream i had during my nap yesterday chris knew my name and said it was nice to see me and we'll see you again soon and we hugged
and also i saw loads of muse gigs where they played like 6-7 songs but they always included either MM or futurism and reapers.
i had a dream we were going to get a kitten!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah possibly #ShowbizForBrighton
and why is national rail enquiries telling me east croydon-brighton is £19 one way????????
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah true, it's muse after all... well if they play showbiz i won't care about anything else #ShowbizForBrighton
aaargh bloody engineering works, i forgot travelling to brighton on a sunday will be a pain....
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME well that makes life a bit more easier now :D #ShowbizForBrighton
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME there's no way they won't play it.
and that was 4 years ago.
everything is happening too fast i don't have time to process anything. i've still not fully realised i've seen OOS in full, twice.
i'm still not over muscle museum wtffffffff
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME ikr #ShowbizForBrighton omg i just typed like the first 3 letters and twitter suggested the brighton/manchester hashtags :D
and they will get showbiz D'''''':
i'm kinda glad i'm not going to manchester because of the queue and everything but i know it's just going to be the most mental gig
im so hngry oh my god
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah but that was a one off only unfortunately.. :D
this is seriously too good to be true. not looking forward to the moment i wake up.
hey i just saw two muse gigs where they didn't play anything from the 2nd law and played futurism instead.
and cat people are moving out next week. :(
kitty wandered into my room again! ^________________^ wish i wasn't so allergic i would have her hanging aroud all the time.
@maja1985 but yeah i totally get what you mean. but this is what it's come to... bc some people just don't seem to like to play it fair.
@maja1985 or newport :D that was the best one in every way!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah exactly! i'd have done all 6 if i had the money, just maybe not queued for each of them... or who knows.
@maja1985 to beat the french? or jut for the fun of it? idk what makes people do this and i'm still prob gonna do the same in brighton. :::D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME unfortunately not. :( but on the other hand i don't know if my body could handle it...
@maja1985 heli texted me they're already in the queue.
looking at my mbellz pics and not understanding.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah and they will bite and scratch.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yes exactly! especially in a country where queue jumping is like a capital offence...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i think pretty much the same.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i guess this is the result of the queue jumping and queuing from hotels...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME idk i suppose they've made a separate queue or something??
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE FINALLY SEEN MUSCLE MUSEUM LIVE JESUS CHRIST
@musclexmuseum yeah true dat. see you!!!
apparently there are already 15 people in the queue in manchester and the french are not there...?!?!
@musclexmuseum cool :D i'm thinking maybe around midnight, depends if i get ill or not D:
@musclexmuseum yeah so i heard D: how early are you going queuing?
my absolution booklet has some weird scribbling on it what is this
food :')))))
@musclexmuseum ooohh are you there already?? i'm heading there tomorrow!
this is the only thing that makes sense in my life and i could just keep doing this until the end. fuck this fucking band.&lt;333__________&lt;333
i'm so knackered and feel jet lagged and shit and feel like i don't want to go queuing in brighton bc no energy but then on the other hand
i'm sure none of this has actually happened.
what a weird week. uno, fury, assassin, futurism x2, muscle museum, solar eclipse, matt bellamy, 3 tiny tiny muse gigs.
also i love this stupid band so much im crying
i've probably said it before but i love reapers more and more each time i hear it. *____________________________*
@BellsFury @SHOWBlZSYNDROME @GreenyBeans84 thank you :')
hey @muse how about #ShowbizForBrighton @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard @Nowherethomas @glenrowe
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME me tooooooo!!!!!!!!! now we just have to spam muse with hashtags!
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah! doubt they heard it though my screaming voice is so weak haha. i'm sure manc will get it though and not us ;___;
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i've been screaming showbiz between each song in newport &amp; exeter i'm going to be gutted if i don't get to hear it :D
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME i don't care i just want my showbiz.
@GreenyBeans84 @SHOWBlZSYNDROME yeah same!!!
i'm sure they'll play it in manc though and never again and i'll never see it live ;_________;
hey #ShowbizForBrighton too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i've got the worst headache why am i staring at this screen.
but who would've thought you'd get to see muse play some nirvana on a tiny stage in exeter in 2015.
and now i've met them all. next mission: to meet them and not act like an idiot. =))))
i just realised that it was in fucking _exeter_ where i met matt. nice.
so if they play arenas this time next year i'll have time to save some money. :')))))) thank u muse.
@maja1985 which in this case will probably be the good heavy stuff there and the long forgotten GL and FG and such rarities for us ::D:D
@maja1985 holy shit :D:::DD so they're finally doing the thing, playing regular sets in the US and then bringing the variation to europe
i had a nice little 5h nap and dreamt i met muse, or at least matt and chris, and it was awkward but still a bigger success than yesterday.
@maja1985 omg what when next year or this???
@Racket @maja1985 and #ShowbizForBrighton too!!!!
a very good question is why am i not sleeping
it's funny how you don't have to go to japan to see futurism you can just go to a couple of uk gigs and see it twice.
whhaaaat have i been tweeting
whaaaat was muscle museum trending worldwide?!?!? :DD that's my boys! :')
@assielina hehhee kiitos :D
@hyper_chondriac i don't know now that there will be two entrances! D: so my plan is not going to work.. but i'm going as early as i can
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME @hyper_chondriac i'm staying in brighton, going to catch an early train to london the next morning.
@musclexmuseum what nooooo
fucking hell so many notifications ::D:
@hyper_chondriac yeah just got home like 10 minutes ago and straight online! :D i'm coughing already...
@hyper_chondriac #ShowbizForBrighton of course!
It's a saturday that's why waterloo is so quiet at 9am!
Fucks sake why am i freezing and my throat feels weird i guess there goes my brighton plan...
Me fail english? That's unpossible!
I just realised i should have said 'for good' instead of forever. Maybe that's why i asked where i'm from.
I had like an hour of sleep and had a funny dream where i saw muse playing muscle museum and i met matt.
Good heavens why do i do things for this band i think i've also caught a cold. Makes me not want to queue in brighton. : D
@hyper_chondriac i'm there now
@hyper_chondriac oh man! :( btw do you know if the bar at the hotel is still open?
@hyper_chondriac oh okay! Did chris and dom show up?
Oh god why did i even open my mouth i've been waiting for this moment and i fucked it up oh god
Whaaaatt the fuuuuck

MUSCLE MUSEUM OG GOD
Aww chris joined moriaty on stage!
Hullabaloons spotted!

Lol they stopped our queue at the door even though the other one was much wilder, and they just let them go... Oh well second row.. Alre ...
Map being soundchecked
His mini though :D:D:D
So close to meeting matt again, i don't think it's just meant to happen :::D
Dom arrived. Gate closed.
@maja1985 are you in the queue or still at your hotel??
So bloody hot!!!
Woah this campus thing so nice it almost makes me wish i was a student.
Oh fuck they put us in 4 queues this can only end in a disaster... D:
Oh btw #ShowbizForExeter
@maja1985 25 now! Are you in exeter already?
Number 23 omg
Yesterday i saw muse play futurism and assassin in a gym hall and now i'm seeing a solar eclipse. Living the dream.
#ShowbizForExeter #ShowbizForExeter #ShowbizForExeter
#ShowbizForExeter @muse @mattbellamy @ctwolstenholme @dominic_howard
Don't know if there's a hashtag going for tonight but here's one #ShowbizForExeter
On the train to exeter!
Bruises are very real tho.
Hmm rock neck isn't that bad this morning. Conclusion: It was all a dream. I mean it must have been, surely???
AND NOW HYPER MUSIC!!! STOP I NEED TO SLEEP.
I can hear TIRO in the room next door! :')))))) stupid band i love them so much i might just explode.
This fancy hotel has walls made of paper. But i just saw muse in a fucking leisure centre and they played futurism??????
Plus ofc the old songs???? Fucking love agitated!!!
I got some hullabaloo vibes at times bc the onesies(....) have similar sort of collars as matt's jacket at that gig. :')))
BUT FUTURISM. like i would already be over uno. Yeah. And assassin goddammit :'))))) that extented riff thing is most heavenly.
It worries me a bit though that starlight has been played at two gigs in a row now lol.
What even is this life
@maja1985 excellent see you tomorrow!
@maja1985 UM YEAH?! how's new cross everything alright there? :D
And @hyper_chondriac wants to say MGJDGJPFGBGKPTKP2GBDPAAPJGNPTGKGNJPTNGAJPTMBGDPDP
AND FUCKING ASSASSIN that marmozets singer surely wasn't lying when she said we're gonna hdve the best night of our lives.
AND BLISS + BALLOONS IN SUCH A SMALL VENUE HAVE I TIME TRAVELLED
FUTU FUCKING RISM
Balloons. It's a school disco now.
Oh mygod this is going to be so weird to see muse in a leisure centre school gym hall like thing.
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME thank you! :D
Omg barrier in front of chris this was surprisingly easy.
At least THAT ordeal is now over and it's time to panic about barrier!
Why did we ever move from our original spot and give the french girls yet another chance for meeting them lol. Oh well.
Lol of course we were on the wrong side of the thing and dom and matt went to take pictures with everyone.
Fucking hell matt and dom where are you
I wonder if there's anyone left in the queue... ::D i hope my food is safe!
@monsieurbellamy @SHOWBlZSYNDROME thank youuuu!
@monsieurbellamy @SHOWBlZSYNDROME idk probably not that many, but this barrier is looong so we're all spread out.
@monsieurbellamy well this stage door thing is surrounded by a stadium sized barrier so a lot of people here, doubt they do any signing tbh
Haha somebody just drove by and played TIRO in their car! :D
@monsieurbellamy yeah and quite in a fancy car too! I don't think anyone met him, couldn't see, he parked behind the trucks.
Omg chris just DROVE here
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME thanks! :D not very likely to meet them though, the support band only just arrived. We've been told they'll arrive late...
@SHOWBlZSYNDROME innit!!!
Wow i've got such a fancy _hotel_ room!
Holy shit just saw the hall where the stage is it's TINY.
@musclexmuseum ikr??? I don't think the french are here maybe that's why haha.
Yay number 16!
STUPID SLOW AS FUCK RUSH HOUR TRAVEL!!! did i not learn anything from that time when i forgot half of my tickets in the machine bc of rush?!
Missed the first train by a minute, what a great start! :D Hope paddington ticket collection machines won't be too busy...
omg they might play uno again
hey i'm seeing muse in about 21 hours
@CarolinaMillan it's £23.60 but you can actually give that to maja because i still owe her for the muse ticket. :D
It's your turn!
You'll have to be VERY loud to beat the Scottish. My ears are still ringing! @m…
that actually happened wtf
i wonder how much sleep i'll get tonight. probably none. gonna sleep on the train then. (as if...)
@CarolinaMillan that your friend had to buy your ticket etc etc :D
@CarolinaMillan anyway if someone bothers to check the name you can always say you only had a foreign bank card that wasn't accepted and
@CarolinaMillan and as the ticket is an advance ticket (it's valid on a specific train only) they will be more concerned about that than IDs
@CarolinaMillan ..railcard, but this is just a standard ticket so it should be fine.
@CarolinaMillan maja will bring it to you! idk if it is, it has my name on it BUT no one's ever checked my id on trains, only when i had the
@hyper_chondriac yeah same, need to collect mine too! see you!!
@hyper_chondriac oohh excellent!!! thank you!
even belfast hasn't still sunk in.
thing about muse is though that they remind me of the fact that i'm seeing them tomorrow. ????????
....so did muse actually wear onesies????
@hyper_chondriac in exeter? that would be great, my train leaves after 5am though so i'll just need to stay somewhere warm for couple of hrs
hey guess what muse played uno.
i can turn my head again! which is quite useful when crossing streets for example.
@monsieurbellamy @musclexmuseum thank you!!!
@monsieurbellamy @musclexmuseum but there wasn't a gig the night before so im hoping everyone being in manchester to give us a better chance
man i need to go and buy queuing food for tomorrow why am i sitting here
@musclexmuseum bloody hell! but that'll be the last gig so there will be people wanting to go really early...
annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd i don't know why my n key is being such a pain
ad then the ending. *_____________________*
and different kind of tempos/rhythms like CE and KOC and things
i'm liking reapers more and more every time i listen to it!! what i absolutely love about it is that it's got so many different sort of bits
@musclexmuseum haha yeah i'm counting on that too :DD for once i just want to be within the first 10-15 people or so.. idk if it'll happen.
ah finally booked my train ticket from newoprt to exeter!
@musclexmuseum yes! and i'm thinking of queuing overnight for once in my life, my friend lives next to the venue so that's a plus. :D
@musclexmuseum aaah right. you're going early to brighton then? :D
well i have literally had my breakfast in bed this week, the other day i spilled my coffee and now my porridge.
@musclexmuseum are you doing any others besides brighton???
@hyper_chondriac yeah i'm def doing after gig in exeter at least as i don't have a place to stay &amp; hours to kill before my train leaves. :DD
i have no idea how i'm going to get my upper body in the headbanging/moshing condition by thursday. D:
@hyper_chondriac oh man that may be possible D: idk i'd actually prefer to meet them post gig, at least you'd have the gig to talk about :D
@DeadStarrr__ yeah that's the problem with this sort of situations... and security will want to rush them on too.
@hyper_chondriac oh did you not meet chris in glasgow?? i'm sure it'll be fine, we definitely need to catch them arriving in newport! :D
@DeadStarrr__ yeah and i'm sure they've seen worse :D but aaahhhhh there are too many things i want to say to them!! :D
@DeadStarrr__ yeah idk why i didn' t realise it's my anniversary month i should probably take my dear old 11yo abso booklet!
@hyper_chondriac ..with people, as much as i'd love to actually have a brief chat with muse i don't think i'd manage... :'DD we'll see tho!!
@hyper_chondriac i had the same thing when i met tom a couple of years back, but that was prob a one off :D i'm generally shy and awkward..
i need to take something with me to newport that they could sign.
holy shit after the belfast stage door thing i just HAVE to meet muse properly. and actually say something.
that train is a pound cheaper though :DD
fewer sleeping hours probably will though.... aaaarrghghh!!
dang should i leave newport at 5:30 already??? so i'd be in exeter after 8... will one hour make a difference really??? :D
fucking hell i don't like how quickly my muse fund is disappearing. :/
current physical state 
oh man i need to be at work in 2 hours how
@musclexmuseum @DeadStarrr__ they'd better do!
@DeadStarrr__ @musclexmuseum it would have been heaps better though without that assassin tease in the beginning :'D but anyway.&lt;3
@maja1985 can i include it in my tour album on fb?? it's such a good photo!
fun fact: on this day 11 years ago i bought showbiz, origin and hullabaloo!

@maja1985 yeah i will do that today!
i shoulld get some sleep
new stuff
i keep forgetting there's an entire album full of muse stuff coming out #soon
*MINOR key i mean
love the rage-y bits, not too sure about the ac/dc-yness :D if the song was in major key there would be no question it'd be near perfect
and those tapping parts have certainly been played before, as a little intro to stockholm syndrome or something
the outro is so very freedom
i still haven't even made my mind up about reapers. i haven't even thought of it really. idk uno and fury and other stuff.
uno?????????????????
i should probably go to sleep but now im not sleepy at all! i¨m trying to process muse and things
what if i call in sick in the morning bc i can't move my head
@muse @MattBellamy @CTWolstenholme @Dominic_Howard i'm so happy you exist
fucking hell do i really still have to wait nearly 3 days to see muse again

and now #FoodForMe
#ShowbizForExeter
but i'd still rather have showbiz. they could do assassin in newport and showbiz in exeter. yeah.
i wonder if they will have rehearsed assassin for newport
apart from the new ones obviously.
looking at the belfast setlist i get the feeling i must have done SOMETHING right when the only song i hadn't seen live before was uno. :D
what's happening to me
i'm almost seriously considering getting some cheap crap tablet or something with internet access so i wouldn't be so out of the loop D:
aww did matt really use the hashtag #fuckyeah :D:D
how do  you handle normal life, what even is it
i'm supposed to go to work tomorrow??????????????
@hyper_chondriac haha my hand is there! :D:D and omg all your glasgow pictures!!! have to go and stalk them in newport too haha!
i canot type
also why does this house smell like dead something??? D:
lol oh well then
