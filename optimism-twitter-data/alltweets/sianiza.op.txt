It seems as though local businesses make too much money to open on a Saturday afternoon <POUTING FACE>
I've had such a good positive day and now I've let you ruin it. Brilliant. Wonderful. Fantastic. #sarcasm
Hopefully things are looking up
This is not just a picture showing me half naked just for attention or anything, I'm just shocked… 
Got an interview for benefit next week! Wooo! #makeup #benefitcosmetics
and when my outer happiness starts to touch my inner happiness.. Sometimes goes wrong.
I'm a happy person, I always try to be positive and optimistic. But sometimes I think how I feel deep down,
Want a fresh start so bad. The only thing standing in my way, is myself.
If they give me something worth voting for then I will, but they haven't, for me personally.
And those who say 'don't vote, don't moan' it doesn't matter to me who wins because they'll do a crap job anyway, no matter what the outcome
I won't be shamed into not voting.
@s2000nath hmm that's a good idea actually
I wish there was a 'none of the above' check box on the polling cards.. That's what I would tick
I do not like any of them, they're a bunch of brainwashing, money whoring, power obsessed lying twots
Don't care if it's a vote wasted, I'm not voting a party that I don't like the policies of even if it's just counteract another vote
I'm not voting as none of the parties are giving me anything that I want to vote for
Wow ok.
I really, really, really, really, really, really like youu and I want you, do you want me? Do you want me too?
Think I've pulled a muscle <WEARY FACE>
If I ever get stupidly rich I'm gonna get a big house with shit loads of land and build the cows and sheep their own houses
I feel really sorry for cows and sheep in fields without barns to sleep in or keep warm and dry <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I used to.. Not so much anymore
Does anyone believe in fate?
I've put too much salt in my soup <WEARY FACE>
Spread across kissable lips
A scar that's healed
A heart still broken
And yet brims with passion
An…
She's so beautiful! 
YESSS! My cheque has arrived finallyyyyy!

Sometimes I wish I had a reset button
Let it goooo, let it gooo
Oh piss it! I always freaking do this why do I never learn gfsuiknjufdsd

I've lost a lipstick <WEARY FACE>
It was nice and bright today #selfie #motd 
I want to go homeee
I've also decided to actually use twitter. Hence the spam of tweets.
I just need a new laptop then I'll be blogging away
Without judgment of taking too many selfies of my makeup <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
This will allow me to improve upon my writing; express issues I've wanted to arise un-status form and allow me to take a selfie of makeup..
In my sleepless state, I've decided to start a blog
Can't sleep grrrr
It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live #ohwell #stillyoung #hakunamatata #stilldream
@joe_weller_ I hope you're not driving in your recent snapchat story! Naughty Weller!
@AidanTurner  #AskPoldark P.S my mum thinks you're 'lucioulicious'! Also if you need a small blonde actress for anything, I'm your gal!
@AidanTurner @BBCOne #AskPoldark out of the 4 episodes that have been aired, what has been your favourite scene to film?
So I got my hair cut short and I love it!! 
@MaddysFairy I'm thinking the exact same thing!!
@Joe_Sugg haha I thought as much!
@Joe_Sugg do you ever sleep?! Love the dedication and commitment though boyo <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@FayeMcDonald10 @zaynmalik weirdo

@Joe_Sugg <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@Joe_Sugg I only got to day 2, on one calendar out of two <FLUSHED FACE>
@LincsFM One Vision by Queen (because they're hungry for fried chicken at the end) from Sian in Horncastle
@FayeMcDonald10 well I didn't need to click on it, i just read it on my notifications
@FayeMcDonald10 how was I supposed to know you deleted it
@FayeMcDonald10 "and I you till dot have any friends<WINKING FACE>" I can't make sense of that
@FayeMcDonald10 read the end of that back.. It makes no sense
@FayeMcDonald10 you're my stalker apparently.. Going through my tweets that I posted ages ago!
You're deliberately trying to wind me up
If you're going to take the time to fill in your eyebrows, please take the time to pluck and shape them too <THUMBS UP SIGN>
It's so hard to find a good monologue! <TIRED FACE>
So much makeup so little money <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@FayeMcDonald10 it's my birthday first <WEARY FACE>
I need friends.
@Joe_Sugg VLOG
@Joe_Sugg @ZozeeBo are you sure it's not how the Rhinoceros lost or found his horn? Don't know the story.. Seems more logical than lost skin
@Joe_Sugg tonightttttttt please
@FayeMcDonald10 ew
Finally feel confident to smile thanks to @3dwhitestripsUK !!! 
Had a go at doing a halo braid in my hair today #hair #hairstyles #halobraid #blond #blonde… 
You'd never think the show was next week by the way our tech run just went. Wowza.
"People think I'm super confident because I've got big hair and perfect eyebrows"
I think it's interesting that the youtubers who initially organised vidcon have less subscribers than other youtubers who attend their event
It's so annoying that everyone is so patronising to Ashleigh in #bbuk! So what she's just 18?Don't treat her differently 'cos she's younger!
I like lipstick 
@TheGeorgeLester it is 100%!!
@TheGeorgeLester because it's so true! :)
@TheGeorgeLester aha ah that's cool! all my college friends are sharing it on Facebook!
@TheGeorgeLester ah no way, it's the '15 reasons why being a drama student is harder than law school' :)

Laptop is broken so no new videos until I can afford a new one!
Making Big Enemies!
@Sprinkleofglitr that is my room all of the time!
Put a collar on my cat, she doesn't like it at all!

Ok uploading video tomorrow! No time today!
I wear my heart on my sleeve. This trait is awful but I can't help it.
@WindowsSupport Sure I'll let you know how I get on with it. Thanks again!
@WindowsSupport ok I shall try that, thanks for your help!
@WindowsSupport oki doke I'll take a look, shall I try each one until it works? Or do you recommend a certain one. It's MP4 at the moment
@WindowsSupport I haven't but I'm not sure how to do that! #technologyfail
@WindowsSupport them they said there is something wrong with the file. Sound was playing though, there was just no video
@WindowsSupport in movie maker on the story board there are tiny red crosses where the frames of the vid should be. And when I clicked on...
@Windows well I was trying to upload and edit a video on movie maker and it wouldn't work
Arghhh windows sucks! Need a mac!
Just filmed a '10 facts about me' video which I'll upload Sunday! 1st video, hope it turns out well… 
Types of people that annoy me: hypochondriacs and hypocrites
Judy Garland and Shirley Bassey are literally all I shall be listening to for the next two months!
I hate drunk people
Had an odd dream that I spent £79 on a bra. And I bought 2 of them. And matching underwear. £248 on two sets of lingerie, crazy dream!
An 8 hour shift with no break, that's illegal right?
@SamThompsonUK ooh you are just so lovely, want all good things for you #madeinchelsea
@MaddysFairy aw glad it's improving!! Aw no really? :(((
@MaddysFairy ooooh dear! Are you ok?? Xxxx
Well I screwed that one up! <NEUTRAL FACE>
London for audition no 3!
Just a tweet to say that nobody is perfect
“@FayeMcDonald10: @sianiza happy #NationalSiblingsDay x” aww you too <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ xx
@FayeMcDonald10 ok see you then!
@FayeMcDonald10 I don't know!! I'll have to figure that out when I get to it. And it depends how much money I have haha
@FayeMcDonald10 yeah I need to live down here, I'm so close to everything that I need for acting work!
@FayeMcDonald10 hour and they told us who had recalls
@FayeMcDonald10 yeah they told us the results after everyone auditioned on the day. So after my audition, I waited round for about half an
@FayeMcDonald10 contemporary means modern. So the speech that wasn't my Shakespeare one basically
@FayeMcDonald10 speech for the recall. Should get an email through this week telling me when it is
@FayeMcDonald10 yes exactly that!! I'm so excited! They suggested that I change my contemporary speech though, so I'll need to learn a new
@FayeMcDonald10 our auditions. It was just so chilled! Well worth the money to audition for them!
@FayeMcDonald10 oh haha. Yeah I thought so! But they all seemed so so friendly! And we got to meet and work with the audition panel before
@FayeMcDonald10 sticker schools? What's a sticker school?
@FayeMcDonald10 your fringe isn't as short as I thought it would be. Ah well we shall see. I hope I do!! I really want to go there!
@FayeMcDonald10 me a recall and that they want to see more of me makes me so happy! It's such a nice school!
@FayeMcDonald10 are the layers short? Ah yeah I know haha! Even if I don't get through the others, at least they saw something in me to give
@FayeMcDonald10 and it's been good thanks! So happy about getting a recall <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@FayeMcDonald10 ok I think I know what it's about, but yeah tell me the deets when home. Oh I didn't notice any layers, why aren't you sure?
@FayeMcDonald10 typical. How's your week been so far anyway? Your hair looks nice from what I saw of it in your snaps!
@FayeMcDonald10 haha! I don't either.. Why can't she do it when you get back.. Why does she even have to do it at all?!
@FayeMcDonald10 really? Why do you have to hoover?!
@FayeMcDonald10 haha, when are you leaving?
@FayeMcDonald10 ok I won't see you until tomorrow. Have a safe journey down x
@FayeMcDonald10 I tried saving for a MacBook once. It didn't work! If you like them and want them, just get them!
@FayeMcDonald10 you can afford those!
Recall in the bag for Guildhall! #happy
Cannot be bothered to move
What is with the delays on the central line?!?! Grrrrr!
Just spent so much money on stuff I don't need. Damn it.
Biggest audition of my life so far today. #scaredashell
I hate it when girls are clearly judging you
Ever so nearly washed my hands with toothpaste
I think a pattern is starting to form here
@JohnStein_ hahaa
@JohnStein_ I'm not too sure if it is, but I know people use it to start talking to new people with the interest of getting together aha
@JohnStein_ it's like a dating thing I think. It finds single people in your area who you can start chatting with. Not 100% sure though.
It's just taken half an hour to brush my hair. #oops
Would love for someone to say this to me 
@leahpalin it was indeed :) I did thanks, you too! Hope you're well :)
Re-evaluated my speech choices, now happy with them. Though I am taking a risk!
“@XSTROLOGY: A #Virgo is neat and tidy and their life is always on schedule.” Hahaha not for me!
ill the week before my audition. #typical
You'll never be regular, because you're spectacular
Yes. 
The little things matter
I take too many selfies but oh well #selfie 
I don't know whether some of the memories I have from my childhood actually happened or if my mind creates images to fit what I've been told
Braveheart, such emotion and passion in that film!
Every man dies, but not every man lives
I'd love to just curl up under covers and watch Disney films all day
#TVD @vampirediaries Katherine is such a biatch
#IfWeDate you must make the effort
@FayeMcDonald10 ooo you've unfollowed me. Must be angry. #oopsmybad
If you don't have trust, you don't have anything
Guys that you can be completely natural with &gt;&gt;&gt;
Awww I was so cute! 
“@autocorrects: i wonder how people describe me when they’re talking about me to someone who’s never met me” - small blonde weirdo probably
Sometimes all a girl wants is to be held and told that they're beautiful
Actually done now
I find it a strange thought that one day I might be married, living in my own house, with a child. #scarythought
“@LostWords_: I'm willing to do anything for you.” Don't ever be unless they are too
Under the stars, the edge of the sea. There's no one around, no one but you and me.
You're my weakness

It's not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain
Always aim high, even if you don't reach the top, you'll be higher up than what you were.
Don't hate the player, hate the game. Ha, pffft!
Just when I think @vampirediaries is confusing enough, Katherine and Elena are sharing a body. Just to make it that little easier to follow.

Happy #steakandblowjobday. May all you men have a big juicy steak and a big juicy blowjob.
Fu.
I like having straight hair every once in a while 
In such a foul mood
and speak less than you know.
“@UberFacts: Facebook has been linked to 1 out of every 5 divorces.” I'm not surprised. Relationships would be better without social media.
Need to use twitter more I guess
Was loving the sunshine the other day 
That's it, another sleepless night for me

Two down, two to go. #theatre #play #acting #drama #stage #selfie #blonde #hair #blue #eyes 
#bbm #addme 
Dream a little dream of me <CRESCENT MOON>
Love the feeling of getting into bed after a long day. Let's the dreams begin <SPARKLES>
One show down, three to go #theatre #loveit 
@DomTheHammer some work?
@LukeFriendMusic bought this weeks heat mag just to see you and you're not in it!! :( #upset #disappointed 
Dress run tonight, nervous for this play! Hope it goes smoothly as it's our last rehearsal!
Catching up on xfactor, Miley sounds blooming awful!
Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination
My hair goes so big when I brush it. #selfie #blonde #big #hair #fluffy #blue #eyes #brush #tanglefree… 
@PhoebeLettice is it odd that I actually understand that?
So tired.
Is that Silas or Stephan? This is the problem when you miss the first 20 minutes! #TVD #tvduk @TVDiariesUK @tvdnews
You can't please some people!
Might just sit in my car with the heaters on full heat
I don't want to go outside. It's too cold! I don't even want to be in my house as it's freezing in here too!
I'm 10% NORTHERN according to the #northometer! That's somewhere around Bournemouth. 
#friendiesproudofluke voted for you so many times @LukeFriendMusic I believe in you 1000%! You're gonna go so far! &lt;3
@autocorrects you should lose your accent when you sing
It feels so much later than 6pm
So looking forward to roast dinner. Can't wait to have some lamb with the mint sauce. #loveit
@benhanlin maybe they're magicians too!
Think I'm addicted to paracetamol. Every time my pain starts up I head straight for a packet! #notgood
Ahh will this pain ever stop :(
#friendiesproudofluke
@LukeFriendMusic Don't take the negative comments to heart, I thought you rocked it! You're the one I look forward to every weekend!
I hate Penicillin
Ooo so tired! Can't wait to get home to sleep!!
Start work at 6:30 tonight, won't finish until 2:30 in the morning. Then up again at 9 to start work at my other job!
Ok not getting my mum to do my hair ever again, second time that its gone patchy! :(
@gemmlarh you look beautifullll!!
@theJamiesWorld it's easy once you've got the hang of it! Sing with it too!
@CyningDom @collegehumor awwwwww!!!!!
Sometimes I wish I could be on the stage forever 24/7 so all I need to think about is being the other characters and being care free. #deep
I hate those moments when you just stare into space and think about everything and then get yourself all worked up and upset.
Ahh life is good!
@Alice_Hare I think I know someone who would have a lot in common with you, and it would happen! Pm me!!!
@evie_ireland aw she says she's really sorry, time has ran away with us! Hope you're having a good night! Xxxx
@evie_ireland she is, her phone has run out of battery and she says she's sorry as she's tried to text you, she has keys so not to wait up x
@evie_ireland awesome thank you! :)
@evie_ireland I am indeedy, Becci said I could come over beforehand if that's ok?
@CyningDom aha no, I drifted off in the end!
@UberFacts: Cuddling releases oxytocin, known as the "feel good" hormone. It increases happiness levels and relieves stress!” I like cuddles
Should probs not go on a drunk twitter rampage! Oh wells!
Wowza! Do not fancy working tomorrow!
I can't believe how drunk I get from 3 large glasses of red wine! Thank god for predictive text!!!!!
Fairly pissed off right now.
@Jodebead yeahh man :p it was amazing!
Lunch and wine with @JeStiCaLs94 and Alex! Lush! &lt;3
Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass... It's about learning to dance in the rain &lt;3
Saying goodbye to someone who's been such a massive part of your life for long is so hard. But it's time to start a new chapter!
Looking forward to tomorrow night! Defo need it!!!
I just want to crawl into a ball and hibernate forever
@JeStiCaLs94 @tommurray93 @jodebead @chelseyph @candiecej @dionoldridge @julianmwalker oh yeah!!
@JeStiCaLs94 yay Jess! Aha :') thank you! I told you I don't go on here much! Only just seen your tweet :') xxx
Why does everyone keep saying that it's summer?! It's not, it's still spring!
:/
But now i'm thinking.. was it?
One of the biggest decisions ever made today - but I know it's for the best.
@vikipotts my bus fair is £7.20 a day, don't think it'll be more than that :')
Bloody ulcer right at the back of my throat near my tonsils. Bloomin' painful!!
#wewanttwitterofsilasweirmitchell
Watching season 1 of Grimm all over again to fill mum in on my new fave programme! Love it so much! She'll love it too! @NBCGrimm @UKGrimm
@Alice_Hare it really does haha :')
@Alice_Hare ahaa, I always seem to worry when I have work to do in the holidays. I don't know why :')
@Alice_Hare too true! I'm so glad we didn't have any work to do this holiday too! Wahoo!
@Alice_Hare haha, that's exactly what I'm like. I don't even have the tv on. Just sitting here is better than anything else atm :')
@Alice_Hare me too, I have the option of putting my washing on, or getting ready to see Sam at about 4. I'm opting sitting on the couch :')
So glad I chose to do a BTEC instead of A Levels!
Goodnight World &lt;3
I have two new lovely jumpsuits ready &amp; waiting to be worn. Just need to see the 20+c's to wear them!

Good morning babe 
Want your massage

This is the latest I've stayed up by myself in a long while!
Cannot wait to perform this! Not long now! 
I miss playing Nancy! Hopefully I'll be able to play her again on the West End in years to come! #MyDream

Ahh, it's nice to have a week off :)

Urgh.
@vikipotts yeah I bet! I'm doing a L3 performing arts BTEC. Singing dancing &amp; acting all the time! Woo!
@vikipotts oh gosh! Pretty heavy subjects! How are you finding them?
@vikipotts aw thank you! I always find auditions more nerve racking than the actual shows! Aw, what are you studying?
@vikipotts it's going real good thanks! I've got an audition tomorrow for our final production! Pretty nervous! :) how about you?
@vikipotts ok cool, I'll get onto it! :) ahh good! :) yeah same for me, a bit overloaded with college work atm, but it's all good :)
@vikipotts aha ;) aww! It would be so fun! In the summer I'll try to organise a trip down and we can hit the town! How is everything?
@vikipotts ooooh, you're an adult now!! Haha, no worries :) I was 18 back in sept and only had my 1st night out like a month ago!!
@vikipotts ah good! You've joined the 18 crowd now! Woo!
@vikipotts ahhh! Birthday money! Gotcha ;') did you have a good day?
@chelseylydiaxo I hope so! Yeah, the bus was stuck behind a gritter this morning.
Omg! I have so much to do when I get home!... IF I get home! #publictransport #trafficsucks!
@chelseylydiaxo oh god! Don't say that! Buses better be running tomorrow!!! :O
@chelseylydiaxo I queued up to get the 5 bus when we finished college and only just on the bus now! :(
@vikipotts whoa! Where'd you get all this money from? :')
Feel like such a Chav in what I have to wear for the dance assessment!
MmmMmmm... looking forward to dinner tonight!!!
As much as I love Shakespeare, I really dislike writing about him.
Mum, can you come home now please so we can watch E.T and eat pears?
When I have a baby, I want to make sure I have that first skin-to-skin bond as soon as possible, if not immediately.
Really can't wait to start rehearsing for Our House! Ahhhh! So exciteddd!!!
First driving lesson booked... Woo!
One of my biggest annoyances is a hypocrite.
I find the whole concept of reproduction absolutely fascinating! #oneborn
@Jodebead ah ok cool :)
@Jodebead ahh cool :) what places did you go to after Lola lo?
@Jodebead  what time did you lot get home last night?
@Jodebead hahaa! I'm really excited! You'll have to give me some drink recommendations! :) &lt;3
This time next year I could be touring the Country, and possibly some of Europe. #wow!
The girl on the counter forgot to give me a table number, so my food has probably gone round the whole café about 3 times now.
#MyWishIn2013 to gain more skill in my chosen career path, and to have a great year like I did in 2012.
Burnt my tongue on my hot chocolate. Ouch :(

One of my favourite Christmas presents! #VampireDiaries @vampirediaries @TVDiariesUK 
@CandieceJ Mine are crossed for you too!
@CandieceJ oh no! And you can't get hold of them to let them know either! Ah man! Well let's hope you won't be needed until next week! Aha!
@CandieceJ The end of the week?! Corr, how rubbish is that!
@CandieceJ Ahahaa, s'alright, only kidding :) my phone never works with O2 :( the only place I can get signal in my house is the bathroom!
@CandieceJ If it wasn't for the naughty word I would have retweeted this :')
It annoys me so much that no one treats college seriously! This is working towards your future and you don't seem to care...
looking forward to eating my dinner.
I have no motivation whatsoever. Help.
Gosh, you can't do or say anything right in this house!
My sister spends more money on presents for the animals than she does humans. #Faye'sLogic
Cookie Crisp cereal is the best cereal EVER!
Hot bath time.. Then dinner with my guy &lt;3
#ProudToBeAFanOf public affection. Can't be hypocritical now.
Oh my gosh, I'm so tired -.- 1hr 38mins left of work. Hurry please?!
A year today since our 1st 'date' &amp; 1st kiss. You mean absolutely everything to me Sam. I love you so so much! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 @samtheperformer

#ImSickOf some people's opinions. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all!
Remember, remember, the 5th of November. Looking forward to the bonfire &amp; firework display tonight with @SamThePerformer :)
@FayeMcDonald10 welcome to Twitter Faye :)
@TVDiariesUK yayyyy! :D
@UnionJworld you guys did great tonight!!!

@TVDiariesUK me too! I've been waiting three seasons for her to turn, now she finally has! They can't take that away!!
@Sonny_dawson aha, yeah I guess :')
@Sonny_dawson not necessarily, as there are only two options. Black, or white :')
@Sonny_dawson each to their own :)
@Sonny_dawson I think the white ones look nice!
#ThingsParentsSay why is it always me that does everything in this house!
@jadie_rhodes aha :) anytime xxx
@jadie_rhodes you're welcome :) you've always got another hand if worst comes to worst :') hehe xxx
@jadie_rhodes stick your hand in a bowl of ice! It'll throb for a bit but will soon start to numb! Hope it's okay xx
Oh, and some books. But reading is always a good interest. Especially when they include Vampires.
I have a new hobby; collecting money. I haven't spent anything on myself for ages! Except a shelf, which was a need, not a want.
My sister deliberately does things to annoy me. I just ignore and let her get on with it. She'll get bored eventually... I hope.
"gosh, have you seen the price?!" "yeah, what are these, like, famous chickens?" gotta love Friends! :)

The fear of heights is illogical. It's the fear of falling that makes us scared.
I wish time could freeze so I can do everything I need to do,then restart when I'm done,so I can enjoy the rest of the holiday without worry

Don't Kill the Originals because then there'll be no Stefan or Damon! Or Elena for that matter! So that means no show!!
I hate working Sundays. Sunday is meant to be the day of rest, and I'm not resting. -.-
Rain, rain, go away. Come again some other day when I don't have to walk home!

“@Laughbook: You're dating my ex? Cool. I'm eating a sandwich, do you want those leftovers 2?”

@TomMurray93 i didn't even know football was on. I can't stand the game!
I don't think moving around on it all the time is helping it heal tbh. But I gotta do what I gotta do. Bruised foot or no bruised foot!
Again, photo doesn't do it justice, but it looks a bit.. mouldy :/ 
Mmmm... Lush bruise on my foot. Photo doesn't do it justice though, it's actually a whopper! 
Hatred for siblings = MAXIMUM

Hello September, Hello 17th Birthday!
@AntonMielie ah ok then. Ahh cool cool. It's impressive though, I'd never be able to teach myself a language
@AntonMielie I could use it if I go to south Africa! :') and wow, did you take dutch aswell? Blimey, how will you remember it all?! :')
I'M SO SO SO EXCITED ABOUT #twtour2012 !!!!!!!!! :D
@AntonMielie to learn something else :') how many languages can you speak? Is it just English, german & Afrikaans? Or more? :)
@AntonMielie take almost any language. French is one of the easiest apparently, but I never got the hang of it. So I'd be awful at trying
@AntonMielie ahh wicked, yeah I know what you mean. Erm, well at my school we had to learn French. But in colleges and universities you can
@AntonMielie oh so I take it you can speak german? I've never been good with languages at school
@AntonMielie speaks it well, and my dads pretty much fluent in it. I've been brought up to speak English
@AntonMielie too individual now. If that makes any sense.. Aha, no I cant speak it. I'd love to be able to though. My mum speaks (cont)
