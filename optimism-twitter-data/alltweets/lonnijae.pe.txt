I WANNA SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. I BET YOU'RE NOT FUCKIN' PRETTY ON THE INSIDE.
ya 
@lonnijae idk what's up with me and whipped cream in a can?? it's probably just like my white cherry powerade phase???
made iced coffee &amp; my whipped cream on top <GROWING HEART><WAVY DASH><GROWING HEART>
the feeling I'd get when you'd call me beautiful is how I always knew, how I knew I wouldn't ever be able to stand losing you.
some days I just can't learn new songs on bass to save my life, other days i can learn like 10.

this isnt philosoph…
I spent years basically blowing my family off but now I realize how fuckin' much I love them so I just wanna hangout with them all the time.
I can't be done with my boy bc there's so much music I need to show him like
i miss you 2 
omg!!! 
@lonnijae literally made her a bomb ass cake yesterday and everything. so rude.
my mom won't hangout with me right now ????
bless bri
now i am officially a cute lil gingery elf, this is a good look.
@mychemicalbriii ilyyyyy
fixed my hair color after buying 5 boxes of dye and using 4 of them in less than a week, i'm doing shots of whipped cream to celebrate.
@lonnijae the universe hears u bye
I was like "fuck it I don't need to pray to the universe to get what I want" so I didn't then I fucked up my hair so then I did &amp; i fixed it
@lonnijae ((indirect to a mutual.))
ok but check ur gross bf's texts and look at the shit he honestly texted me until i blocked him......
someone put the blame it on bad luck//bayside bass tab up on my 8th birthday so clearly me learning it is meant to be
ok I think my hair finally fucking dyed right
@lonnijae so don't fuck with me or you'll get my fist pounding into your throat
i just learned how to properly punch and how to effectively punch someone.
@lonnijae the amount of money I've spent on hair dye in less than a week is fucking gross I was literally crying about it yesterday.
attempting to completely fix my hair color for the 5th time. if it doesn't work I'd threaten to cut my hair off but I already did that.
@bulletshalsey_ the first one!! omg it'd look so good!!
@lonnijae no actually fuckboys trying to pressure me into shit and not backing off until I block their numbers gives me panic attacks. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
having to explain myself to people that keep asking me stuff and won't just back tf off gives me the worst panic attacks ever. excuse me.
feeling way better today.
@lonnijae bye
online school is really convenient if you're a person who does risky shit, fucks up, &amp; needs a couple days to fix the mess that's been made.
@taimelizabeth jealous
@taimelizabeth wrong-o
@taimelizabeth there's no exposing? it's my real name? I was born with it?? I'm not lying to the world???
I'm checking out of life this week good bye
@taimelizabeth um check my birth certificate hoe
happy Mother's Day I'm calling my mom crying while having a mental breakdown bc she's not home
how many dumb decisions can I make in literally 24 hours
@lonnijae honestly the reason why I'm so pretty like look at her
I told my sister I'm totally legally gonna change my name and she's not down with it
happy mother's day to my rock//bff//everything. I love you with all of my heart. 
I mean I'm like the queen of repairing damaged hair and growing my hair out but this is just annoying <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@lonnijae so u have to trim it when u don't want to <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
when the ends of ur shorter side of hair are dead bc u bleached it so they look lighter than the rest of ur hair even tho u dyed it again <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
nothing has changed. 
@taimelizabeth happy Mother's Day.
happy Mother's Day.  
happy Mother's Day @taimelizabeth
<PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> 
when ur texts are full of boys trying to date u or see u naked and ur honestly just <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
I ate hella food yesterday but I don't even look hog bodied this morning?? my whole body just hurts a lot.
I fucking hate how I go through stages where I either just can't sleep at all or all I do is sleep
uh oh
ive trashed so many pairs of shoes lately and so they now all have holes under the heels like why am I like this why is this my life
it's just me &amp; my food baby.
I'm either alone or I'm with you and I honestly am 100% content with that. I don't need to be in a relationship. I just need happiness.
I can't even deal with myself lmao oh my god
im into ugly shitty guys bc I hope that me being too hot and good for them will make them worship me/not hurt me but it never works that way
@lonnijae you're like drugs. you're fucking killing me and I know it but I just can't stop bc I love it and need it.
the way you treat people is fucking disgusting and you're not even that cute but I can't fucking leave you no matter how hard I try.
tru shit 
104lbs with a bottomless pit for a stomach
@lonnijae bc I'm not good at causing people pain.
why have I not dm'd this poor girl the screenshots of her bf claiming to be single/asking to hangout/saying he'll be with me. honestly.
honestly 

HERES YOUR FUCKING SPACE 
@lonnijae yo follow me
teaching myself while wearing a lil dress. I hope I fall. 
i stalk my own tweeted pics when i'm on my laptop bc i am obsessed with myself
@lonnijae if the pain stayed consuming me i would've went and layed down in the freeway already but i didn't do that bc it's all gonna be ok
the shitty situation i'm in doesn't control my life or feelings anymore, i got past letting it consume me a while ago, that's why i'm alive?
i end friendships with people when they tell me what to do or how to feel.
i just realized that i literally taught myself all the important stuff i know. how to do makeup/dying hair/cutting hair/bass/losing weight.
i can basically play Identity Disorder so God bless
@lonnijae look at that artist you're trying so hard to be, they created their own look &amp; sound &amp; THAT is why they made it. duh????
you can't just completely rip off an artists look &amp; play the same exact music they play &amp; expect to actually get anywhere.......
I walked out of my house &amp; what do I see but a boy skating who looks exactly like the boy who has my heart &amp; shits on it. amazing. <BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL>
"where are you going? it's not your normal walk time."-my mom 
"to engage in hoe activities. bye!!!"

when you remember that, how can you feel anything bu…
revamping my hair color later bc reasons so I'm excited to actually be the Pumpkin Queen
@lonnijae me: scares this group of 12 yr old boys that live in my neighborhood to teach me
I'm teaching myself how to skate today literally in a tight lil dress and vans bc I don't need a fuckboy to teach me shit.
lowkey same  
me being done with you is just the biggest fucking lie, this'll always go on and on and on.

when I said I hate you I was lying through my teeth.
this time a broken heart didn't make me hard and cold, it made me sooo full of love that I could throw up from it.
I'm so fuckin happy and in love with life.
@mychemicalbriii OKAY ILY
@mychemicalbriii OKAY OMG I MISS YOU I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU OMFG
it's okay to accept &amp; love yourself, especially your "flaws", you don't need to be at war with yourself. it's okay to be you.
@mychemicalbriii where tf r u!!!!!!!????! <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
remember when I said I was gonna start using my snapchat but only posted one lil video then abandoned it again.
when none of ur friends reply 2 u but u can't say shit bc u go days not texting them back <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@lonnijae you see me happily eating my vegetables but I'm also daydreaming of eating a double double &amp; froyo &amp; pizza &amp; cookies. all 2gether.
I have the most disgusting appetite ever but I somehow manage to stay eating as healthy as possible 97% of the time.
@lonnijae I'm literally sitting here, eating celery, watching them make chicken wing ice cream, red velvet funnel cakes, &amp; donut burgers.
carnival eats got me fucked up right now. chicken. wing. ice. cream.
I've always had a thing for old school diners &amp; carnivals but I don't think I've ever actually been to any.
I'm not fucking crazy I've just been mistreated
I really fuck w the newest om&amp;m album thnx to iTunes Radio for always playing it.
I make lists of things I need &amp; give them to my mom every week &amp; right now it consists of more hair dye &amp; whipped cream in a can.
i'm like in a relationship with myself honestly
@lonnijae always remember
that coffee is still fucking me up oh my god i'm shaking
@SNCKPCK the way u think is so cute i like ur brain
@lonnijae seeing this album played live is literally all i ever wanted in life so thank you @RonnieRadke bless
@lonnijae i stay crying
@lonnijae this was the best night of my whole 2015 or life actually like this album//old etf are why i ever wanted to play music
@raremetria im feeling it
i drank so much coffee that me attempting to learn new songs is just a bad idea right now
my process of learning new songs on bass is me sitting on my floor yelling many cuss words &amp; playing wrong notes until it all just clicks
try to find another girl who can play MCR's entire discography on bass
gonna learn how to play Identity Disorder on bass since I've successfully finished 12 school lessons today bye
music is the only thing that makes me feel anymore so that's why I gotta make my own so I can help everyone who feels exactly like I do.
I'm really considering legally changing my name to just lonni jae and getting rid of my last name.
I'm honestly just so hot I don't even know how I did this like its honestly just the universe rewarding me for being a good loving person
I may be crazy but life's amazing.
@lonnijae she's literally using my fucking makeup brushes???
"lonni. I will give you 5 dollars of you give me a shirt to wear." taime says to me wearing clothes from 24 hrs ago covered in sex bruises??
I don't feel hella ugly without makeup on with this hair color bless
me atm 
I love myself so much so I don't need anyone else to love or even like me. (aka why I have absolutely no filter and am not ashamed of shit.)
I'm crying bc my heart is like this and so I'm also crying bc I'm crying so what's new
why am I like this lmao
okay, let's be real I'm not even sad over this boy anymore like I'm doing hella good//I look hella good. I just snapped a lil earlier. gn. <BABY ANGEL>
I look so cool with orange hair honestly
@nylondaydream same it's literally 12:15am and instead of sleeping this is what I think about.
@brittchaps love you always.
@lonnijae that's why I should just be a hoe at this point
I fucking love boys but getting genuine feelings is so rare for me &amp; that's why letting go when I find someone special is impossible.
I keep coughing so I hate myself
@mychemicalester ME TOO OMG I SAVED IT TO MY PHONE AND CRY LAUGHING EVERY TIME I SEE IT. ITS EVERYTHING TO ME.
your mom is actually me  
all I want is to be adored, find someone who wants nothing more.
all types of boys are really into my 2005 emo aesthetic.
on a walk wearing sunglasses at night adjusting my boobs on the sidewalk and burping veggie dip burps bc this is what rock bottom looks like
you know I make it hard to walk away.
I've popped off and I'm also not even home so maybe I'll get ran over.
PSA: I need a cute boy that'll teach me how to skate/not lie/break my heart/talk to other girls/try… 
@bonespanek I love Pearl &amp; Voilet this season!!!
jk I can't be done I will never be done
psa: lonni jae has finally cracked.
I'm just going to ruin your life and be done like you've done to me. I hate you so much.
I'm heartbroken and am getting beaten by a fuckboy like how can I be sane  
I'm literally just crying bc all I want is to be fucking be happy and this isn't what I ever fucking wanted.
2015: me hitting rock bottom every 2 weeks realizing I can't do this anymore &amp; instead of ending things I try to fix them &amp; it doesn't work.
I do this to myself. i hold on to words that I know have no meaning or promise.
I just hate this I'm over it
why is this even a thing like how does one person do this to another and honestly just expect them to be okay
baby, please come homeee
I finally found a dye that's the exact color of orange my hair is for when I need to redye it. God bless.
@xFrown maybe not
@xFrown maybe
@Louis_Tomlinson <GROWING HEART>
the year is 2065 &amp;&amp; I'm still listening to Dying Is Your Latest Fashion every day of my life.
a lil #tbt feat. my dirty mirror &amp; @niallofficial// 
<PENSIVE FACE>
my new look is just so me.
ok I can't do this I miss my boy so much like I try to be like "I hate him fuck him" and I do hate him but fuck this shit
missin you so much
I don't even know what my vocab on here even is like I just make new meanings for words but it all makes sense for the most part.
bring....,,... bring me my coffee IV............
bc you're fake af and abandoned all your fans and are a liar so why should we not drag you  
bc you tried to drag Louis who's supposed to be your brother and stay being a paper towel for that grease ball NB <WAVING HAND SIGN> 
elementary-middle school me would look up to and wanna be the current me so that makes me really happy.
@lonnijae its really soooo much better than their other albums.
honestly &amp; truly, the new fir album is actually good but the album cover is so ugly and trashy, it really upsets me.
seriously @nylondaydream really just gets me that's why our lil band is gonna be so successful
LET THIS TWEET BE A PSA//WARNING 
I'm honestly just addicted to getting heart broken so I guess that's why you're perfect for me.
so my hair color turning out basically the original orange I wanted on complete accident is proof the universe is on my side.
my face would finally be clear if I would stop touching it and picking at every lil flaw all day like
@nylondaydream ofc <GROWING HEART>
honestly me. 
@nylondaydream you can always text me!! <BABY ANGEL>
@zaynmalik bye bitch

in less than a month my little sister has managed to give me the stomach flu and now a cold. this is why I can't fuck with 1st graders.
this interview actually changed my life 
truly a class act 
sometimes I get really obsessed with a song and I can't stop listening to it so then I focus on the basslines and it all makes sense.
@nylondaydream exactly like zayn &amp; naught boy are just a joke &amp; all they have is their pathetic tweets while Louis is still livin the dream?
@nylondaydream lhow is he gonna try to drag LOUIS??? HOW?? I can't even. like this is such a joke lmao

tip 4 my girls: drink helllllllaaaa water when ur on ur period &amp; it'll literally shorten the amount of days it lasts. ur welcome. luv u. <HEART WITH ARROW>
this is me enthusiastically showing u all my hair in shitty lighting 
I gotta fucked up brain and a really bad attitude.
I didn't even need to open it to escape how convenient 
@lonnijae that's why u don't "date" a fuckboy without killing his soul &amp; finding out all real sides of him, duh? bless ur naive soul tho.
@lonnijae you sit there with him in your bio and hella posting pics with him but look at his dry ass profiles &amp; live ass texts. sorry babe.
if ur "bf" doesn't post about u AT ALL on social media//make it obvious that you're dating, he talks to other girls/lives like he's single.

this dip is so bomb I wanna die eating it like with it still in my mouth
on a happier note I'm eating my fav veggie dip and celery rn and so I'm okay for the moment bc it's bomb af
there goes my filter on my true feelings, out the window with my mental health !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I fucking hate myself &amp; how fucked up my head is why do I want someone who literally doesn't give a shit about me &amp; who could hurt me so bad
@lonnijae it's like hesitant alien album cover Gerard but toned down.
@lonnijae unless you're Stephanie bc she is like my sister
I hate when I do something to my appearance and ppl are like "send me a pic!" I can't just take good pics on command. u will see when u see.
my hair is a lil damaged again but I look cool af
really tho <TWO HEARTS> 
@nylondaydream your bio is me like honestly you just get me <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
sometimes I just have to smack everyone in the face with fucked up truths about me since my other tweets are me frontin.
i truly think I know my soulmate but I friendzone him bc I think I deserve the shit the boy I fuck with now puts me thru so there's that. <BABY ANGEL>
@lonnijae I'm just like "fuck it" at this point about my hair and am just going with it bc at least I don't look hella boring anymore
@lonnijae *dyes hair light brown but it just comes out a more natural orange*
me: I wanna dye my hair orange
*dyes hair orange*
me: no I wanna dye my hair light brown
@lonnijae I have to trim the dead ends off so that's not cool
I look like a cute lil anime character so that's cool
@lonnijae it's like w classy hesitant alien orange I guess.
@VioletChachki &amp; @pearliaison are EVERYTHING 2 me <TWO HEARTS>
I don't even know what color my hair is about to turn out????
i feel like shit &amp; i need to fix my hair
that was the worst sleep I've ever had
I'm about to throw up oh my god
I'll take this as I should just let my hair grow and chill then dye it half &amp; half again lol
@herrystylas no I have no makeup on lol it's not even bad it just has like weird highlights that I hate and it's not as bright as you think
@herrystylas it came out an ugly color so I'm dying it tomorrow morning
what hoe 
2day I realized I hate myself &amp; also I need to stay in my lane of neutral colored hair dye. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'll be by your side until the end.
this apple is so good like I'm tearing up over it
@xFrown eat
happy birthday to my twin sister who I was accidentally born 3 years after. even though you're 20… 
i feel like we just get it bc twin telepathy so we never really show sisterly affection.
@lonnijae get each other so the universe did something really great making us sisters.
@lonnijae especially in this last year bc we've gotten really close and don't really have boundaries on what we tell eachother and we just +
&amp; i know she stalks my tweets so i just wanna say like even tho she used to beat the shit out of me i couldn't ask for a better big sister +
i'm gonna write taime a nice post on instagram for her birthday later
how can you think any of this was easy?
@AcaciaBrinley bc all these 13 year old girls think they have a chance with and own their favorite band members.
@dakotawint me
I'm doing a thing today.
I'd be prettier if my whole entire self was mirrored, you know what I mean???
what was I supposed to do
you know I love yoooouuuuuuuuuuu
I actually wanna go to prom next year since its senior year so I have a year to find a boy to take me that goes to actual school.
@MirandaSings none bc u wood chucked it n ur a girl y do u have that so gotcha
I just want my boy to hold me like a child and pet my head but we hate each other at the moment &amp; that's just adding to my emotional despair
@lonnijae lol jk maybe like 7
I've literally been waiting 9 years to fall in mutual real love to post certain lyrics that are very near and dear to my heart.
@LedaCMuir Leda!!!! how do you care for your hair after bleaching so it's not all brittle and damaged?! <BABY ANGEL><GROWING HEART>
I'm so happy to be alive and I love myself and life but there's just something not right inside of my head and heart.
I don't hide how sad I feel &amp; if it offends u that I uncontrollably feel like this pls get over yourself bc I'm probz more positive than u.
when ur mental state atm is absolute garbage and u wanna die so ur mom takes u to chipotle. 
@lonnijae my mom is buying me chipotle so I won't kill myself
I'm so hungry and I just ate and I want to die
@sorryimalex are you cheating on me
I'm just gonna start trying to date @sorryimalex
@nylondaydream YOU LOOKED SOOOOO GOOD YES GURL <FIRE><FIRE><HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW>
@lonnijae me: <BABY>
my mom literally just cleaned my whole bathroom for me.
I don't wanna even think about your existence today like i just want to go get a burrito that's all
I just added 5sos covering mcr to the long list of reasons I want to get plowed and destroyed by a speeding bus
@lonnijae dramatic changes r happening bc I'm fuckin over everything
still into you is such a lil fuck ass bitch to learn on bass oh my god
@lonnijae it's not even just one show I'm into, I watch them all but I don't even cook and I have a diet of 6 things like ????
Since I've seen every single episode of boy meets world and dateline, I've moved on to the food network &amp; cooking channels.
tru 
my real relationship goal in life 
still never cutting my hair again tho
my hair is so cute at this length.
dating me is also basically a music education class
most times the views I see walking around are the only things that make me happy to be alive. 
@sorryimalex is that why you don't DM me back :///
@LedaCMuir how do you treat your hair after bleaching it so it doesn't get dry and weak/brittle? <BABY ANGEL><HEART WITH ARROW>
honestly me  
tired
could someone show him how to love
I just had to stop everyone around me and told them "hold on I just need to cry okay" then proceeded to have a mental break down.
<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
maybe it will all workout like in the movies, but I know romeo must die before the ending.
I'm gonna take a nap so I don't hang myself or s/t
@lonnijae bc you really fucking suck.
how about you ask yourself, is this REALLY the person you wanna be in life?
"just kill me already I have nothing left to live for."
"yes you do, you have many more obnoxious hair colors and haircuts to have."- my mom
follow me on Instagram yo @lonnijae
I always post on Instagram when it's dead af so then I wanna delete and repost lmao
@xFrown <PERSON WITH BLOND HAIR><PERSON WITH BLOND HAIR><PERSON WITH BLOND HAIR><PERSON WITH BLOND HAIR>
@xFrown buzz cut? <SMIRKING FACE>

@MCRofficially happy birthday!!!!!
@lonnijae I listened to fevers &amp; mirrors when I first met the boy who has my heart &amp; cried to it bc I knew he was gonna hurt me really bad <BABY ANGEL>
bright eyes makes me want to literally commit suicide but I still like them.
playing God is just something I've always done.
@lonnijae patterned boy crew socks r everything 2 me.
missin' winter 
@JEDlGERARD U LOOK LIKE A CUTE LIL PIXI
downloading spotify was the best thing I've done for myself all week.
slowly but surely getting my skin cleared up for the most part after trying out liquid foundation. never again.
boys know I'm fucking insane but they still fuck with me. if girls knew the real you, you'd be alone forever.
omg Ty ily <HEART WITH ARROW><BABY ANGEL> 
@lonnijae 
lmao hold tf on I have a story to tell u all
I dead ass thought I was pregnant or dying so I'm relieved lmao bye
I don't have time for my period this month I have to go kill a boy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
i just wanna know how you can live with yourself.
ugh

I'm not ashamed of anything and I'd actually prefer if people didn't even like me bc I hella like myself.
I actually fuck with the new fir album so talk hella shit about me please xolnni.
I should go to the doctor bc I think there's something wrong inside of my body. maybe I'm dying. <BABY ANGEL><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><HEART WITH ARROW>
<PENSIVE FACE>
how do I stop being so lowkey evil and mean
remember last year when I was 100% nice to everyone but then I got my heart broken so now I'm hella mean to boys :/
@lonnijae and if you don't end it with that it's probably why you're not my boyfriend right now.
the only time it's acceptable to slide into my DMs is if it ends with you saying you'll buy me Canes or In &amp; Out after you ask to be my bf.
I haven't realized how much my hair has grown bc I keep most of it tucked behind my ear.
my heart belongs to one person, that's not ever gonna change and also I'm kind of emotionally unstable at the moment so get tf out of my DMs
I thought my appearance screamed "emotionally damaged; stay away"
@lonnijae this is real life.
pls tell me this fuckboy from school really DID NOT just DM me a selfie trying to talk to me on instagram.

In that case, I can be annoy as hell and will text you 7 times in a row with …
I love Mayday Parade so much, they're my warm weather go to music.
Orange hair is coming sooooon
@lonnijae she gets that I'm a special, magical, lil human bean.
my mom is my bff like we've had a special bond since before I was born &amp; she always tells me how I've always been her lil guardian angel.
fuck this kind of "toilet paper" it's literally a fucking napkin is this a prison or a school 
I went to the bathroom and every toilet dead ass had pee in it. why are elementary school kids so gROSS.
@lonnijae she likes the Madness album.
my mom likes all the music I listen to so when new albums come out or I find new artists I like I always play them for her in the car.
I'm sweating so I really am on the verge of killing myself
@lonnijae orts and mcr shirts and stood under a tree the whole time
my mom forced me to go to my lil sisters field day w her like I did last year and I just realized both years I wore inappropriately short sh
i don't even know how I made it through the end of last year or even the past few months but it just means that I'm even stronger.
my forest green knit Pom Pom beanie is everything to me like I don't even need to do my hair half the time bc of it.
@lonnijae I just woke up excuse my punctuation
I keeeeep having dreams where I'm 7-9 months pregnant. at this age and everything, what does this mean?! it's freaking me out. <WEARY FACE>
Ale just called me and I was passed tf out but I completely woke to answer bc I thought she was like about to die, that's tru friendship ok.
seen the UGLIEST parts of u but I still love u
i never felt more alone than when i fell, so i don’t know why it took so long to get back home.
and i found some scars in places i have never shown to anyone.
if you say In &amp; Out is nasty but yet you fuck w White Castle PLS fav this so I can block you.
really tho why does @zaynmalik honestly associate himself with trash like @NaughtyBoyMusic. It's embarrassing and gross... get it together.
need orange hair asapasapasap
I have notebooks and my phones notes full of stuff I've written and one day it'll be turned into music and fuck everyone up bc real shit.
these poems that are gonna be turned into lyrics for my girl band this summer are gonna drag you more than I already have.
I jwant 2 get hit by a big ass speeding truck ty v much <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm happy but my heart is just so sad.
@lonnijae wtf my phone auto corrected this shit??? zayn*
you were easy on my eyes. you were heavy on my heart.
I need to dye my hair asap
zany changed his name so i'm just gonna go with believing that his ass saw my tweet calling him tf out
I'm okay. sometimes I find myself collapsed on the floor in a lil ball with my arms wrapped around my legs hysterically crying but I'm okay.
@gerardssunshine thank you <TWO HEARTS>
I love myself more than anything so I really don't need a fuck ass boys love to be happy, I never have and it's never been about that.
it's so hard to be together and it won't get better. days go, days go by but I must, I must try, forever.
I walk a fine line between coping and insanity.
@lonnijae I'm so cute
tru tbh 
@sorryimalex I know
the live version of Let The Flames Begin from the deluxe self titled always fucks me up
#tbt oh my god, oh my god, if i die, i'm a legend// #blessed #iconic

change happens naturally so if you have to force it to happen, it's probably not right.
actually me. 
I have bruises on my back. carpet burned knees. and I just almost broke my pinky and it has a big ass gash in it.
how many times a day do I need to get injured??? why am I so clumsy????? why me????
people in my life have just accepted that I always will just do whatever I want and so nobody tells me no anymore
is it bad that I'm actually laughing at last nights episode of catfish
idk why I'm drinking my coffee out of a crazy straw.
contouring is my religion
accurate. 
I'm going back to sleep since that's all I've done today bc last night killed me. bye.
my lifestyle revolves around me never giving up and working to reach my goals every day so it's like now I can't give up on anything ever.
@lonnijae ya right fuck this shit I'm not having a cheat day for a while omg
I'm so hot when I get food babies <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
this <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>  is <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> my <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> new <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> fav <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> emoji bc I hate it so much but it is so demanding <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
thank u thank u ily &amp; I am truly honored xolnnijbryar. <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><WEARY FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> 
soda taste sooooo gross to me now
I can't wait to be happily married and have my own cute lil 2005 emo revived family
I can't wait to be a mom some day.

FOR THOSE WHO IS CURRENTLY USING MYDOL APPS PLEASE UNINSTALL IT FOR YOUR SAKE ISTG . READ THIS 
@cliffordleave you're welcome <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@cliffordleave happy birthday!
the flavor of my gum was so strong and so my throat literally closed? and I was choking trying to breathe???
I guess it's because when I was emo last September/November I constantly tweeted my genuine feelings and shit so now I'm hella frontin.
@lonnijae just kidding I really need to stop but idk why I even do it or how to stop lmao
when will I stop making 89% of my tweets be an over exaggeration of my personality and thoughts??? probably never.
I hear boys skating lemme go strut past.
in case ur interested in how to get free rides//drugs//pizza: walk around alone in spandex booty shorts
@lonnijae I hope he saw how hot I got.
ok so apparently this boy I used to hella love was at the show last Saturday but he was there just for FIR.. thank god I dropped him lmfao.
so I'm facing the world with a naked face right now for the first time in forever and I'm owning it ok
this is now about not letting some lil fuckass boy that ain't shit victimize me as if I'm not too good for him. hop off.
"find a good guy that'll love u"
<SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
@lonnijae I should add she told me to do it instead of becoming a stripper bc she still thinks I'm serious about that.
my mom said I should become a cocktail waitress at the HOB (bc I like being half naked) while still being in a band &amp; that's a v good idea
me w this food baby 
omg bless thank you ily <TWO HEARTS> 
@lonnijae I need one of those old ppl buttons for someone to help me get up
i was like "how can I really get into ur head and fuck you up even more than you've done to me" and then it hit me. unconditional love. duh?
I took a nap and tried to get up to pee but my legs were too weak and felt funny so I fell down and got rug burn on my knee ok
everything in my life is always great &amp; amazing except for my love life &amp; I grew up with a shitty dad so I guess it's my souls lil downfall
when a boy tries to do you hella dirty it's like girl code to blow up social media with bomb selfies so he'll realize how dumb he is.
throwback. typical lonni jae. 
I miss my old room it had good lighting.
the shit I've been pulling lately on this boy due to being a stubborn heartbroken brat got me hella tired idk what I'm doing anymore
I'm garbage today
@lonnijae <COLLISION SYMBOL><COLLISION SYMBOL><COLLISION SYMBOL><COLLISION SYMBOL>
I ate so much food I'm going to pop
taime just told me that I'm being so extra right now. excuse me.
I don't need you or anybody else.
@mychemicalbriii <GROWING HEART>
I only get full when I drink water, if I didn't my stomach would actually be a bottomless pit.
I'm just gonna eat snacks and sleep I feel dead af
this shit is draining me so I really just need to get it together.
I am so over tired and hungry I wanna nap and eat snacks all day then die
I want pepperoni pizza and a burrito and a milk shake and fries and chicken fingers and red velvet cake.
I think the universe knows that I'm so stubborn and I'd probably die if I didn't get my way so that's why I always do.
so I finally got a plan for my life after school.
can @Twitter make the media tab on profiles back to a big collage of pics instead of a row of them &amp; get the old quote tweets back. thnx.
I've been in my bathroom on the verge of taking my makeup off for literally an hour but I'm distracted by how <FIRE> I am
@mychemicalbriii ur icon is <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
I will always love with all of my heart no matter how battered and bruised I may end up. The love and compassion I feel are fuel to me.
I'm not doing shit tomorrow
I'm soooo cute
my hair at this length is soooo good
ok can my period come out now I need an excuse to eat hella snacks
@lonnijae so ugly I'm gonna delete this pic
@lonnijae usually it's just loving someone unconditionally who doesn't appreciate me
my form of self destruction has always been staying in shitty situations that ruin me mentally, i can't ever just stop &amp; leave.
these guys honked and did the metal horns @ me bc my sweater but I flipped them off anyways oops :/
the strays is my happy song.
I've always been true, I waited so long just to come hold you.
so I stopped wearing foundation &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; my skin is finally clearing up <UNAMUSED FACE>
why I still wanna be with a shithole boy that I hate and doesn't deserve me is beyond me. I guess I blame daddy issues.
once I got hella skinny my walk changed and so I walk hella weird now and I really do not understand why
ppl can ask me "wyd" at any time of any day and my answer lately will always be "trying to fix my fuckin life"
look i just need my boy once and for all bc this shit is really fucking me up and I'm over it and me dating his ass is an H O N O R
Atlas//Man Overboard is actually me.
@loveallhatesyou lmfao
I didn't even make him he was like "I have a huge dick lemme txt it to you" literally on Christmas but he's blessed 
tru tbh  
@loveallhatesyou I don't even think he knew how much I liked him but man did that situation fuck me up for like a year afterwards hahaha
@loveallhatesyou no lmao I told him that I'd talk to him after a few months bc i couldn't deal w him anymore but then we never talked again<WEARY FACE>
@loveallhatesyou ok nevermind......
if it all goes wrong I'm just gonna buy a burrito and cry but it's not gonna go wrong anymore
@loveallhatesyou he's probably still hot as hell but too bad he's like 21 now lmao
@loveallhatesyou Daniel? lmao no way haha I stopped talking to him one day and it just ended forever
@lonnijae like tonight.
@loveallhatesyou omg and when we would talk about Alesana and how I was in love with a boy that's 5 years older than us omg
@lonnijae if they're hella dark and kinda shimmery I'm probably not up to any good.
you can tell what I'm doing that day by how dark and on point my eyeshadow shades are.
I hella love my lips
I have bruises on my back and I don't even know why
I've really stuck to stepping up my Instagram game lately I'm proud of myself
I'm waiting to drop the pic Alex Ramos RT'd on Instagram for the most perfect time bc I don't think all the ppl I know irl are ready for it
BABE AF <HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW> 
casually matches my bedding// 
how cute <BABY ANGEL> 
I'm freeeee 
no like I'm so pissed off bc of how hungry I am right now everyone better get the hell away from me
I get hella bloated when I'm starving :/
can I leave now 
I need food ASAP or else I'm going to actually kick someone their face.
finished my ACTs so now I just want coffee &amp; not to be bothered
I don't wanna be awake wtf
@RonnieRadke 
I don't wanna wake up early tomorrow and do things??? like required testing for college?? when I'm not even going to college????
do you know how long I've been looking for the perfect way to word that last tweet. since mid July.
I was always introverted but then you came along and all I wanted in the whole world was to just be with you always.
@lonnijae I started with fixing my shitty ass personality and attitude.
I asked myself what I needed to do to get an actual crush on myself, then I did everything, &amp; now my self love/esteem is unbreakable.
when people I love act really shitty and rude it literally disgusts me.
cycle seasons, watchin you leavin'
@Harmony_CTEPTV LMAO
but honestly I don't care to have hella money. I care about being genuinely happy.
@lonnijae she is now lecturing me but I'm just saying if shit goes wrong u gotta do what u gotta do ?????
my mom asked me my backup plan so I told her I don't have one bc I know I'm here to do important things but then I said I guess a stripper..
try texting me!! 
idk if i get further handling you with love or being a fucking bitch anymore
can I skip forward a couple years to when I'm done with school and a working musician that's in a happy relationship or what
you don't even KNOW what you've started
@sorryimalex literally me though.
it's like I honestly don't give a fuck I just am trying to repair the fucking hole in my chest where my heart gOT RIPPED OUT AND STOMPED ON.
this group of boys are THE most problematic and childish people I have ever met in my fucking life

"Andy Warhol of our time on snap chat" 

see what the hype is all about. nickasd 
@lonnijae the staff of my online school are a bunch of fucking unorganized morons &amp; their shit is going to fuck ME up.
i'm REQUIRED to test tomorrow &amp; they just now informed me i NEED to have a school ID from this year to test but i don't fucking have one???
indirect 2 the shittiest boy I've ever met in my life. xolnni. 
push me past my breaking point, I'll push you off a cliff.
I don't even feel like a person. I feel like a fucking object. what the fuck.
such a great fucking night.
@nylondaydream ME TOO <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@nylondaydream EVERYONE IS GONNA LOVE US
@nylondaydream YES WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING KICK SO MUCH ASS
@nylondaydream I luv u 2. forever hating the same things. <HEART WITH ARROW>

@nylondaydream and the tests are literally the same shit as the proficiencies like wtf <WEARY FACE>
@nylondaydream GURL SAME FUCK THE SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR STILL MAKING IT REQUIRED EVEN IF YOURE NOT GOING TO COLLEGE IM SO PISSED
@lonnijae and it's hilarious to me bc I hate every boy that talks to me and don't ever flirt back so idk what they actually think.
the amount of times i hear from guys on a weekly basis that I'm only getting talked to bc their friend only wants to fuck me is disgusting <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@lonnijae &amp; my makeup is still on point, I'm honestly just a blessed lil bean.
my hair is so gross rn that it didn't even get fucked up in the wind and it all just went back into place, I think I'm onto something here?
Idk how I convinced myself that I'm not scared of anything anymore but it's the best thing I've ever done.
<SPARKLES><WAXING GIBBOUS MOON SYMBOL><SPARKLES> 
I'm invincible in my short lil h&amp;m baby doll dresses &amp; combat boots
mama I'm going home
I cut tf outta my lil birthmark shaving today so I had to use my last Clarice/Rudolf bandaid on it :/
I found confetti in my boot
i hella look like an alien now probably bc I actually did get abducted 2 years ago and that's just the explanation I have for the glow-up???
everyone caught on to the laying down selfies//icons.
hello, I am in need of ur mothers homemade tacos @Stephaniiiiie_
since taime is turning 20 I am turning 20

  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ 
every time I go to a show it's like my goal to be a relevant, working musician is revived.
@lonnijae last night my eye shadow stayed on A+ &amp;&amp; I've walked 20 miles without it budging. it's literally heaven sent.
btw fam, i swear by MAC's paint pots. I use painterly for my eyeshadow base and that shit locks it on no matter the occasion.

you can't fight fire with fire and not expect everything to burn
my hair has never been so fucking gross and there's probably alcohol in it too but guess what I'm not even gonna wash it today
@LedaCMuir ur welcome
I'm 100% psychic about people's love lives. I've proven it time &amp; time again with so many people. I should turn it into some kind of career.

anxiety: im glad you asked
last night I got to see my favorite album to ever exist//the soundtrack to my childhood//the… 
how it hurts in the worst way now that you're gone. 
guess who 
boys be like "ur so cute &amp; cool lets hangout" while in a relationship. if I was ur gf I'd snap all ur skateboards &amp; shove a wheel up ur ass.
do I look like a side hoe???? I don't think so??? I am literally the queen of your life or you're NOTHING to me.
I'm a lil warn out since you fucking tore me down.
dead ass swear I'm gonna throw a shit fit if I just got my period I have things to do today I cannot be bothered
@lonnijae why the fuck are you in a relationship if you aren't staying faithful to that person?
um what's up with boys cheating on their girlfriends lately?? I've witnessed it sooo much in just 2 days, it's gross.
don't talk to me if you have a girlfriend?
sick n tired of bein' all alone 
UM THERES A MENCHIES HERE IN VEGAS?? I COULDVE GOTTEN UP WE DOUGH???
@lonnijae SHE MADE ME GO IN AND ORDER IN &amp; OUT LITERALLY ID RATHER DIE I CANT HANDLE THIS

TAIME LEFT ME TO GO TO THE SHOW ALONE AND SAID SHED BUY ME A BURGER NOW SHES TRYING TO DIP OUT ON THAT

sOME TRAVI ELVOWED ME IN THE RYE
@lonnijae we made eye contact. I should wave.
ok there is a bae upstairs sitting and watching the show he's kinda tanish with a soft brown comb over with one other boy. I need him.
@lonnijae I'm going to puke
imnlowy gonnq pukenthebpplv in this crowd are hella nasty like I hate being mean but so gross I need to get a shot so am protected
yo I made a friend HERE IN REAL LIFE  so fuck off I can be hella social
the couples here are soooooo ugly like why does Trevor have to be such an asshole we coulda beat them all.
ghost town doesn't even have a bassist so I'm like bye
I'm actually going to cry when they play the DIYLF songs like I'm so embarrassed and it hasn't even happened yet.
@lonnijae I'm purposely gonna go in the middle of the crowd during the guillotine so I get really hurt xolnni.
@lonnijae there's a dying is your latest fashion back drop like that's actually me every night!!!!!!!!
all alone but it's ok 
I fucking hate Trevor so much, I'm going to drag him soooooo bad, just wait, but until then I'm about to have the time of my life. bye. <HEART WITH ARROW>
I'm going to go see my favorite album ver played in its entirety all by myself and I don't give a fuck I'm so happy
I'm literally going to the show alone tonight because Trevor is a piece of shit. fantastic.
you know the world is fucked when you're walking near a guy in a wheel chair but only YOU get offered a ride by some guy.
I'm so pissed off and idk what sanity is right now so enjoy the lil shit show bc I've officially had enough.
@lonnijae actually idgaf
can you pepper spray someone for treating you like shit and breaking your heart repeatedly and never actually being sorry about it
I can &amp; will own up to everything I've ever done in life, you're the one who sits behind so many hurtful lies but I know every single truth.
@PrincessMakiboo I do it all the time it's kind of nice
you are allowed to share your stories and don't have to be quiet about how people treat you or their lies or the pain they've caused you.
@lonnijae you think you can fuck me up emotionally and then just dip out, you either make things right or I will ruin you. <BABY ANGEL>
I am sooo close to just taking a sledge hammer to your life and letting every single person know exactly who/how the fuck you are.
ew 
change your name you're not in one direction anymore bye @zaynmalik
@lonnijae my skin was like clear af before I used foundation.
ok Ive been trying foundation out but all it does is make my skin look gross and break me out so I'm sticking to high coverage matte powders
it's been 8 months but I still read the letter chapman mailed to me when I'm sad.
you know when you just see something and it actually completely kills you.
i somehow ended up sitting in the shower hysterically crying
@NickFNMiller Vegas!!!! I miss you guys!!!
@mychemicalbriii I've been texting you!
@mychemicalbriii are your texts working?? <WEARY FACE>
@mychemicalbriii aka cry 2gether over everything <HEART WITH ARROW>
I just keep sleeping in later and later
nothing makes me completely freak out more than when people yell//argue
@lonnijae I called my mom to come get me bc I'm so hungry I'm going to end up fighting someone
I straight up almost punched a guy in the face for getting close to me and looking at me and then cussed out creepy a guy driving past :/
@lonnijae idk what I'm wearing and I'm hungry af but it's nice outside
when ur whole family is annoying and dysfunctional so u literally throw random clothes on and just dip tf out when they get home
want Greek food.
@sorryimalex me
this time I'm not going to watch myself die.
isn't one of the golden rules of life to not become who hurt you
when u look hella weird lately and don't know if this is just how u've always looked? 
an angry person sees an angry world

it isn't about what you look at
it's about how you l…
I wish I had a friend in Vegas that would do  hella dumb shit and almost die with me but I don't.
I remember like 4 years ago taime and i would have huge sing alongs to the whole A Lesson In Romantics album.
ok did you all know Siri had a built in shazam and will find any song you need to know on iTunes for you BC I JUST FOUND OUT
*5 minutes later*
"and you know what else-"
a few weeks ago, pretending like not having an obnoxious hair color isn't killing me. 
the circa &amp; lights iTunes radio stations play all my favs so they're all I listen to so I lowkey somehow broke the stations..
nothing motivates me more than when people doubt me and tell me i can't/won't do something because i will do it and i'll do it obnoxiously.
I HONESTLY am a TRUE blessing. you're welcome.  
me: gains followers when I'm hella emo and want to die
me: loses followers when I'm actually happy and positive 
ok
chipotle is apparently going to start delivering and I just woke up so I'm crying about it
@yxxngfamily thanks!
always have compassion.
@lonnijae like actually pissed off at me when I'm not interested in them. I do not understand.
boys get hella fucking MAD at me when I don't wanna fuck with them. get the fuck out of my face.
me: cries
I love making people feel more confident and actually believe in themselves, it's actually my favorite thing to do.
@ me bitch 
@lonnijae lol jk I cannot fuck with them anymore
yo catch me @ slipknot &amp; MIW
I'm v proud of myself right now.
when I'm successfully making music and am relevant to the world I need someone to create a comic book character//super hero after me.
the only time people literally ever text me anymore is to check that I'm not putting myself in danger//about to die???
why am I so tired all the time
so I've been waiting to hear the most perfect lyrics//quote to get tattood down my left forearm(?) and they just hit me
@lonnijae time goes by hella fast tho so whatever
growing out this haircut is the most annoying thing ever I actually hate myself for cutting it
my last RT was like a smack in the face I fucking love her what the fuck
@lonnijae *only watches one episode ever*
donut showdown is my new fav show
@mychemicalbriii <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
Gerard is my heart and soul and my dad and my everything
THIS pic is everything 2 ME 
I'm so irritated with my existence this week
I've been looking like shit since Monday and I don't even know wHY
how tf did I even lose a makeup brush wtf
@lonnijae &amp; I got realllly fuckin tired of being unhappy.
notice the change in my mood, I had to become hella spiritual again and learned to center myself. <BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL><BABY ANGEL>
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE ALIVE
next year i swear on everything i am not letting ANYTHING mess me up enough to stop doing school work again, i'm going to fucking graduate.
@lonnijae i was going to die if i didn't leave normal school and take care of myself mentally so honestly me being alive is more important
online school sucks i really wish i didnt fuck myself up academically when i was in 9th grade oh my god
I never understood why or how my sister slept so much but then I got her old room and now it's all I do.
I don't think my imessages have been delivering to bri so wtf am I supposed to do with my life honestly
ok i don't care for a lot of people, but if I do care about you, I will lowkey stalk you &amp; so if you lie to me I already know the truth.
@lonnijae "fuck people and love!!! moneymoneymoney!!" ok but honestly what are you really left with at the end of the day
when you understand that life is about SO much MORE than just money &amp; materialistic things you'll learn what real happiness is.
as if we will literally ever be over
sometimes you just gotta sit down and keep repeating to yourself that it's okay, whatever you're worrying about will be okay.
I will NOT be a bitch on the side or be w someone who stays fucking w other girls, like cut ur hoes off or I will cut ur lil dick off???????
@lonnijae for future reference I should probably keep my mouth shut and just confront the person once we're actually hanging out.
I'm getting ignored because I didn't wanna hangout with you if you fuck with other people and bc I called you out on your lies lmao ok boy
I could have a book written about all the dumb, reckless, ballsy things I've done since September due to being emo lmao
when I get to have my half hair back the new colors i'm gonna do are gonna be sooo me like it's gonna be so good
I need my longish hair back so I can look like a bratz doll again
@lonnijae this is the first time I've actually willingly been out in the sunlight in like a month......
lovin life &amp; the world #EarthDay <EARTH GLOBE EUROPE-AFRICA><TWO HEARTS><BABY ANGEL>

@JinkxMonsoon morello!!! omg.
this year I decided to no longer be scared of anything and I'm doing a really great job at it.
cloudy days are the best.
I try to tweet about my longing for a burrito while half asleep and I forget words goodniGHT
@samanfaka I'm half asleep
............... 
y'all probz think I'm stupid and illiterate af bc the way I tweet but I'm actually constantly looking up new words and definitions lol
I refuse to let someone treat me like complete shit and just get away with it scot-free, fuck that, I don't think so.
@lonnijae bc then it'd actually be me
I wish I could change the stripper song on myidol so I could have my cartoon dancing to MCR :/
@lonnijae &amp; HE IS 15
now every time I see the boy who sexually assaulted me I can't help but to laugh bc he straight up confessed his love for me
i need new sports bras.
I can't even get over how cute I am as a lil cartoon.
me af 
@MizzoTheO myidol
ok world I figured out my future hair colors and everything but I'm waiting like 2 weeks to do anything bye
my makeup was just so off when I was doing it earlier so I had to just pound on the brown eyeshadow and contour and it ended up ok
I'm not sorry for dragging the fuck out of you just like you're not sorry for hurting me.
take me back to this night pls 
taime's making me get into brand new
@Clairvoy4nt_ ily2 <HEART WITH ARROW>
i feel like i'm suffocating today??
@Clairvoy4nt_ no! haha
im gonna delete timehop bc i literally just fucking hate who i was before 2014
ppl think we're cool but I probably have u muted unless I know u irl or if we're friends or if I like ur acc lol
my window was open when I woke up this morning but I don't even remember opening it?????
I want all of my hair to be longish again I'm so over this haircutttt
I was actually the biggest piece of shit person 2/3 years ago and my timehop confirms it. so glad I'm not the same person. oh my god.
how can u be sad when 2 of the ppl who made u wanna sing keep making songs together??????? 
fall down 5 times, stand up 6.
I've never been so tired
same 4 u <HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW> 
@mychemicalbriii I need it back
@lonnijae REMEMBER WHEN
I'm honestly and truly actually soooo happy, despite some bullshit situations in my life right now or how much I say i want to die.
@BrookeMeranto TELL ME WHO COMES BACK YOU GET TO SEE IT BEFORE ME
I dead ass thought 4/20 was a joke except for if you're like in middle school but today I realized people actually take it hella seriously..
washing my makeup brushes is so annoying I wish I had money to just buy new ones every week instead
showered and washed my face and changed my clothes just to get back in bed
@lonnijae I think I'm gonna barf why did I think this was a good idea oh my god
I'm soo good at talking shit (((actually just stating the truth with a lot of cuss words))) to asshole people so don't fuck with me.
I dragged Trevor sooooooo hard last night so now he's ignoring me like a lil bitch <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@mychemicalbriii try DMing me then bc I've been responding to every text you've sent
@mychemicalbriii I keep texting you back but I don't think you're getting them
@mychemicalbriii are you getting my texts???
I just ate sooo much ice cream I look pregnant I am literally a piece of shit today but i am celebrating being alive
wtf lmao 
@lonnijae I'm going back to sleep bye
@lonnijae my whole body doesn't even know what the fuck is going on.
let's talk about how I am somehow still fucking alive, still wearing the same outfit I was wearing last night, and just fully woke up??
I'm about to be in sooooo much trouble
this guy didn't speak English at all but needed directions so I had to basically play charades with him to help
I literally almost broke my fucking ankle WALKING in front of hella cars. they all fuckin saw it happen too.
I realized that nothing's scarier than actually wanting to end your life so anything that's making you wanna do that to yourself isn't shit.
well here goes nothing.
on a scale from Pearl to Laganja Estranja of how chill I am right now, I am thankfully at a Pearl.
@lonnijae I'm actually v calm but I wanna remain calm
this was actually @taimelizabeth when she moved out 
dude I need like 100 xanex to calm myself right now
@mychemicalbriii literally us
@lonnijae by the end of the year I'll have my old hair back so idgaf about it right now
my makeup is sooo good that my dumb ass haircut doesn't even matter.
I swear I wish I was a boy so bad but only so I could fight Trevor.
me: *checks phone* 
me: better get some friends
@lonnijae literally hate her
@gerardssunshine he deactivated lmao
dumb hoe comes to my house, drinks my last water bottle, then passes out on my bed? <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> 
darling, don't be so shy, I'll see you at midnight.
i know you're dead inside and it's what I like.
I was dying without bri
ur at 3 million  
@PrincessMakiboo yeah! I used to be v chubby but wore stuff like this and now I'm smaller than I was in this picture and i still wear it! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@PrincessMakiboo no, don't say that! it doesn't matter your size, I bet you'd look good in it too!
@PrincessMakiboo thank you <TWO HEARTS>
@lonnijae my body here was cute
i miss last summer &amp; my hair 
that's right bitch 
@lonnijae its weird when ur body is constantly changing bc looking back u just feel like ur different ppl, it's like that's not even me?
back when i was cute n happy 
I should be really concerned with my mental state at the moment but I'm just laughing it off <BABY ANGEL>
if something makes me anxious for a longgggg time my brain eventually gets fed up and blocks the feeling out so I can resolve the problem???
@lonnijae but it'd really come in handy sometimes.
I'm scared as fuck for so many reasons to drive so I'm literally waiting till I'm 18 to even make an effort
sooooooo over this
@lonnijae jk I'd rather die. just one will do.
I hope I have like 50 sons just so I can raise them to not be lil assholes.
every time I meet a shitty boy I just wanna talk to their mom and dad and ask them if they REALLY raised their kid to be like this????
I need bri
I wanna collapse in the street everything is just so wrong
watch me end up like dying like its not even funny but it is funny
such a beautiful but TERRIBLE feeling I want to rip my insides out
I'm so fucking lovesick and I actually think I'm going to die from it if I don't do something about it soon.
@lonnijae like however you prefer your body to be, own that shit, but don't shame other people's bodies <BABY ANGEL><TWO HEARTS>
@lonnijae being skinnier than someone doesn't make you better than them, having a big ass or boobs or curves doesn't either!!!!!!!!!
it's about loving &amp; being happy w yourself, so if you're comfortable in your skin, awesome! if you wanna lose weight, or gain weight, do it!
why are you body shaming tho......... 
deciding which shades of brown eyeshadow I want to wear is the hardest thing I have to do every day.
tomorrow will be really interesting.
finally have my appetite back <BABY ANGEL>
@lonnijae fuck it like I'm not dying my hair until it grows back and I can do this again bc it is just ME
this HAIR WAS E V E R Y T H I N G 
@buIletsmcr it is EVERYTHING 2 me
pearl is my newest fashion inspo
my horoscope is so accurate
well I just realized a boy I was in love with years ago is 21/almost 22 years old right now hahahahaha what the hell
my sister is seeing her favorite band ever right now and since we have twin telepathy I feel her happiness <BABY ANGEL>
only death will stop me from getting what I want.
bet ima find a dead body 
@lonnijae always be urself <BABY ANGEL>
@lonnijae that will actually make me NOT like you :/
when people talk shit to you about something they know you don't like but are all over social media talking about how they love it ???
wTF IS THAT HAZELNUT STILL DOING IN MY NAME 
I drank too much powerade......
80% of my tweets are an over exaggeration of my actual personality.
do you ever just accidentally spend an hour admiring yourself in the mirror......
when ur trntbl.me is on shuffle and Turbo Swag comes on and u actually just have to sit and question ur entire existence
boys really act like I won't pepper spray the fuck out of them when they act disrespectful lol
accurate af 
finally got powerade now can I stop being sick so I can stop drinking this shit
<BABY ANGEL> is my new fav emoji.
I hate when people fuck up then go into hiding and just won't talk to you??? I will find you and fucking make you talk.
i be knowin
why did you cut your hair like naughty boy @zaynmalik why are you doing this to yourself
ME  
2015 is just the year everyone cuts their hair and looks like shit.
bECAUSE THE WORLD WILL NEVER TAKE MY HEART
I can only listen to Welcome To The Black Parade when it's playing from my record, otherwise I hate it bc it's soooo over played.

@lonnijae me: survives off white powerade
@lonnijae me: will do anything for white powerade
me: replaces all meals with white powerade
I'm not scared anymore.
lowkey want breast implants.
@herrystylas I love you
@herrystylas I see you stealing me tweet hoe
me: please don't make me think about my life
you said you hate my suffering and you understood and you'd take care of me, you'd always be there, well where are you now?
why do I have to know when bad things are going to happen before they do. I feel like I jinkx people's lives.
@lonnijae 4 years ago to this day the same exact shit was happening and I almost fucking ended up dead but not this fucking time.
my life is LITERALLY repeating in cycles. on the same exact time period and everything and I am not gonna let it keep happening.
fuck ASS BOYS ALWAYS FUCKIN HONKING AND SHOUTING AT ME WHEN I WANT TO DIE LIKE I WILL RUN IN FRONT OF YOUR CAR BITCH.
hell is so close to heaven.
long nights and the worst days, lived it all, but I didn't break.
there's a SIDEWALK &amp; a BIKE LANE for a reason!!!!!!!!
I willingly stay in this situation &amp; I'm a big girl that knows what she's doing so I really don't need anyone's shit about it lol
keep shitting on my heart &amp; I'll just date all of your best friends since they're always telling me how beautiful I am &amp; how lucky you are??
everything tastes gross I'm about to just say fuck food and go get a white powerade on my walk.
wHY DO I HAVE TO NOT FEEL GOOD TODAY
I still can't believe I got sick like ???
food and water still taste gross to me
I've been in my shirt and underwear all day bc I can't decide what kinda bottoms I want to wear..
Me: 
I CANNOT deal with people who are CONSTANTLY freaking out and complaining. I just can't tolerate people like that what so ever.
thnx u 2

@FunGhoul13 exactly!
toast is the only thing that makes me feel better rn im gonna be so fat after this
all of my hair is finally healthy except for one lil asshole section. all of my methods have payed off. <BABY ANGEL>
boys that play guitar and skate are my fucking weakness fuCK
@FunGhoul13 it sucks bc I always stick with them no matter what or how shitty they can be an also bc I kinda just blow everyone else off lol
maybe that's my problem, my heart only latches on to/cares about certain people that come into my life and I just can't ever let them go.
can this shit totally leave my body alone already!!!!!!! ok I am a healthy lil fuckin bean I don't deserve this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@lights yessss
@lonnijae the drag race emoji app is EVERYTHING
I got out of bed and showered and washed my hair and am doing laundry so I'm not totally dead anymore but I still feel kinda shitty.
@BrookeMeranto 2nd!!!!!
@lonnijae I will usually go back to everyone eventually unless you get mad at me for it, I'll just drop you bc I feel more suffocated. lol.
if you get mad at me for ignoring you I'll let you stay mad bc I've said it so many times, I. need. my. space. it's. not. personal.
sorry but I don't owe anyone anything.
me: gets sick for just 9 hours
ok I feel my health level shooting back up
God bless!!!!!!

I made taime download the rupauls drag race emojis so basically that's our whole conversation
I'm literally going to die
I can't stop sleeping and I'm scared to eat or drink anything bc I don't wanna puke bc stomach acid puke is the worst thing in the world.
I rarely ever get sick and if I do it's literally only for 10 minutes.
@lonnijae but the feeling got unbearable so I just let it out and it was only just my dinner? and then I just stopped and feel better? lmao
@lonnijae all night I've been waking up feeling like I have to puke but I just kept getting myself to fall back asleep.
when the stomach bug REALLY tries to come for u but u barely eat anything and ur metabolism is fast af so it doesn't even happen.
I feel sick to my stomach and idk if it's bad vibes or I actually just feel sick.
fuck u 
idgaf, the new sws album is so good and just full of good vibes and just sounds like what happiness would sound like???
idk I think all the dirt that was flying at me and that tree that smacked me in the face just got me realllly thinking excuse me
life is soooo much more than money and materialistic bullshit.
the wind was literally throwing me around but I was so happy like how fucking magical is life and being alive and the world and weather
me: listens to drake

@lonnijae except for my best friend &amp; my boy &amp; I mean I feel hella bad about it but I can't control it.
I get suffocated by people sooo easily.
i hate when people look at me but I also need to have obnoxiously dyed hair and weird makeup and just need to stand out from everyone???
my hair is growing out soo fast so it's gonna start look boring af and I won't gonna stand out from everyone so I need to dye it soon.

I just finished Remember Me and like are you fucking kidding me why did it end like that whY THE FUCK DID IT END LIKE THAT
my hair is way longer than it looks bc I have to pull it all to the back for it to look decent but it's ok bc it looks good af lately.
@buIletsmcr omg what the fuck <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I miss you. 
i don't try to look pretty, I try to look really obnoxious and weird but still really nice and appealing to look at, like art or some shit.
I know where your heartache exists, it's when you are alone and when you're around me.
@lonnijae at least I have my dad watching over me, keeping me company.
I'm not getting out of bed or moving or talking to anyone for like the next 10 years. 
I need to see trevor
2 years later &amp; I did it <BABY ANGEL> 
me 

me: i bet there's hidden cameras
it's like I'm okay and happy and understand that I did a really great thing but I'm also really upset bc it's just sad.
I literally am ignoring everyone.
i can't even sleep bc I keep crying like  that precious baby didn't deserve to fucking die
I literally chose to watch Remember Me for the first time rn &amp; in the first fucking minute the lil girls mom gets shot in the chest. lovely.
I just puked so hard. what the fuck even is today.
fuckboy logic: I really like you!!! but I'm gonna disrespect you and treat you like you're not even a human with feelings!!! bc I like you!!
lemme redo that
@lonnijae I almost puked on him lol
I literally feel dead.
@lonnijae that really sucked but I wrote a lil note and put it under her. I feel like the life is sucked out of me. I wanna sleep.
excuse me while I go cry &amp; bury my child in my front yard.
@ayefuckface you're so pretty! <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
at least we got a hella cute selfie together. RIP ily baby. <BABY ANGEL><RABBIT FACE><TWO HEARTS> 
@sorryimalex me
@lonnijae I knew it was coming bc we had a special connection, I was crying before it even happened.
@FunGhoul13 thank you <TWO HEARTS>
I love you too &amp; thank you <TWO HEARTS> 
leave me alone to cry and eat my weight in soft baked chocolate chip cookies
my face looks like the dying is your latest fashion album cover.
RIP to my lil angel baby. I tried everything I could to save you and I don't know why this happened… 
@lonnijae I can't breathe
my baby died
I would actually rather kill myself in the most painful way possible than be out in the sunlight.

<WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX>
she won't drink the milk and is just laying like she's weak and I'm crying bc I'm scared.
@lonnijae so I'm just gonna take care of her and feed her milk and be her mom until I decide if I can actually stay taking care of her.
ok so I've come to the conclusion that this bunny is just so small that she can't even walk properly or eat actual food???
whatever I'm dying my hair orange like my underwear 

Me: *waits like 4 minutes to respond bc I’m ignoring them back*
where's my boo
still the same tho  
@brittchaps she's hella salty rn bc I have to lock her out of my room bc she can't be around her lmao
@brittchaps I know but my cat is gonna hate me!!
i don't know maybe <CONFOUNDED FACE> 
@lonnijae also I think he is a she
@lonnijae jk I just gotta take it with me to the pet store to buy milk to feed it.
me: brings my bunny w me everywhere
@lonnijae needs people like me in it.
I literally wanted to die but then the universe put this bunny into my life so I can save it and so I realized that I can't die bc the world
you know when a mom gives birth and cries just looking at her baby bc she's so in love with it like that's me and this baby bunny.
kinda still hate u
story of my life 
I love him so much my heart literally aches 
update: my lil bunny pooped and is a v sleepy boy.
I can't sleep bc I love this bunny too much to sleep
my son <BABY ANGEL> 
@lonnijae I'm crying bc I love him so much I'm so happy that he seems to slowly be doing better
I WAS LAYING DOWN AND I HEARD LIL ANGEL MAKING NOISES IN HIS BOX SO I TURNED THE LIGHTS ON TO CHECK ON HIM AND HE WAS WALKING!!!!!!!!!
<GROWING HEART> 
@lonnijae this was literally about my son.
if I can't save him I'm going to cry &amp; have a funeral for him so just saying.

I'm gonna learn every TDWP song on bass and then FaceTime taime and make her watch me play them all.
I love the food network.
I'm still deciding if I should just be like fuck it and go orange with my hair or just let it grow out and then go back to my half hair.
@lonnijae go like my pic
my mom &amp; I are like bffs so all we do is talk hella shit to eachother &amp; about boys.

@lonnijae literally mostly listen to music that's years old bc there hasn't been a lot of new good music lately??
like I can't stop listening to the zombie ep even tho it's 5 years old
I actually pee 3-4 times every hour and it's really inconvenient.
remember when I first cut my hair like this and I didn't give a fuck about shit so the shorter side was like an inch long.
I'm kind of unstoppable when wearing leggings &amp; a sports bra.
actually me.  
@RuPaulsDragRace you @taimelizabeth
'cause I've been hangin' on you, I've been waitin' on you.
I've always wanted pastel pink hair but I feel like it'd look weird when I wear dark red (the only actual "color" I ever wear) ?
