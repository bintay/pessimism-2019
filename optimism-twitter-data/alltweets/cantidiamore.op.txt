@bbygray All normal things.
I cry. #LastRT
@Jessmuir0407 I did not (with a couple exceptions) but I‚Äôm liking the way things are sounding now.
I think I like this whole ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try to un-fuck up all this shit that went down in S7‚Äù path we appear to be going down.
@evilapprentice These I like.
@evilapprentice .grabby hands.
@RobHanning #sass
@CarrieCornish DUDE. That ride is terrifying.
@Jessmuir0407 Renewed I think.
@bbygray I'm pretty sure an AD could just lay on the floor and you would find it sexy, haha.
@evilapprentice God, I love Helena. She's my most favorite.
@evilapprentice Hahah, yep.
@manamitru Haha, well I'm seeing a lot more talk about it so‚Ä¶seems legit? Who the hell knows anymore, haha.
You guys. I know I'm like adulting at work and whatever, but you gotta keep me updated on news so I don't come back to timeline chaos.
@manamitru Nah man, I'm going to lunch. And then continue working. Haha
@fembot_nicole I read this as how do I not even have a beard. Ignore me. I'm tired.
@manamitru No, you can do whatever you want. I'm just saying that *I* want no part in this mess, true or not. Haha
@manamitru The last 2 days have been ridiculous &amp; I frankly don't care what they do at this point, but watching this unfold is entertaining
@emmaswanstan omg I want. now.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 @o10courtney After that, it's a free for all.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 @o10courtney Rule of 3s. You find 3 sources saying the same thing. Sure, they could be lying still, but you check.
@vivalaswedes What is adulting idk
@vivalaswedes Is this like‚Ä¶not what we're supposed to be doing?
@manamitru Just listening and not asking questions is how cults get started though‚Ä¶
@castle_examiner This is why I drank multiple mimosas this morning.
Let's just everyone go outside for 20 minutes, absorb the universe vibes &amp; accept that everything you're stressing about means nothing.
I've had three mimosas this morning. I'm 100% useless and should probably just go home.
@bbygray It happens to all of us. Wait. No. What?
Long read, awkward writing, but important nonetheless. "Penn runner's depression masked on social media 
@bbygray He might be a horcrux dude.
What in the hell is going on?
Morning text to my siblings: "Did we get Mom anything for Mother's Day or are we terrible children?"
That sneak was so serious for 8am. I didn't hate it though, so that's a good sign.
@CarrieCornish Lost. My. Shit.
Last weekend I had to cut my hike short because it was so hot. Tonight, I‚Äôm curled up in boy pajamas and it‚Äôs raining. #CmonLA

@bbygray This is what I have right now. It‚Äôs not a bad life, let me tell you.
If I was going to be any character on Scandal, I would probably be Quinn and that terrifies me. But is also awesome. #ScandaI
@Jessmuir0407 I never watched it so...idk. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 YES!
@manamitru I‚Äôm excited‚Ä¶cautiously optimistic is the better description. I love S1, so if they can get that flow back, I‚Äôll be really happy.
@manamitru that was the most excited I got all day tbh

#ByeKermit 
@RJalias SOOOO EXCITED
And yay #Castle, obvs.
AGENT CARTER GOT RENEWED?!?!!
@RJalias Nooooo I love the Muppets haha
@manamitru This is exciting.
THE MUPPETS?!?
@bbygray People at work always tell me how sweet I am and I literally laugh in their faces.
These are the messages I get in the middle of the day. 
@4x07 @Jessmuir0407 She gone.
@ashtonsage Your push-ups look like mine! Haha
@jessmuir0407 It has been really quiet. Even after episodes‚Ä¶no GIFs. But that makes sense.
@jessmuir0407 The last two years it was like complete radio silence on Monday. I'll probably be on tumblr this time. Haha
@bbygray Yeah, I suck at that game. Haha. I could tell you if someone has been on Castle‚Ä¶but nothing else.
@jessmuir0407 I just remembered I don't watch finales w/ the east coast. Well, I haven't before. This one I haven't decided bc I don't care
@bbygray My coworker is basically a human IMDB. When she was the series she was like THATS SO AND SO FROM *show name* and I'm like ok sure
@pickyourpoison @thunderoni_ yes I support this you can have all my money
@pickyourpoison @thunderoni_ I'm going to need like actual proof immediately
@pickyourpoison @thunderoni_ well
@thunderoni_ I need to look this up after my meeting.
@thunderoni_ Right like anything even remotely related to Hemsworth should be sent directly to me
@thunderoni_ I'm sorry what how did I miss this?
Today's #TBT playlist is 90s grunge. I'm coincidentally wearing plaid and combat boots and I support this.
@jessmuir0407 Why?
@MarshieBCakes It‚Äôs just not the same without the  preservatives though haha
@MarshieBCakes I totally had that for dinner two nights ago, haha.
@carriecornish I will! I just got a movie gift card, haha.
Orphan Black gets a 4th season. Thank you, TV people.
Honestly, getting my @RockCampLA assignment is basically like opening presents on Christmas morning. But actually way better.
@courtkneeee Girl. All the employees at my position got promoted today‚Ä¶except me. This is also a thing that sucks.
omg @evilapprentice my #LastRt
@msxdx I want to goooooo
@alexalala At least now I can get paid more. Aw snap. (get off Twitter now Angie)
@alexalala <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèΩ
I have tested my Mexican liver. I think I won, but I really can‚Äôt be sure.
@alexalala Wait; am I a boy? I'm drunk. Ignore me.

@StacyRaeG 23
@MarshieBCakes Girl, I‚Äôm am working on it. Too many Tecates though. Gotta try tomorrow. Haha
@CarrieCornish Yes! Let‚Äôs!
If you think I'm not drinking and on tinder trying to get a pizza right now, you don't know me at all. Thanks for the tip @MarshieBCakes.
I‚Äôm on my second margarita and I haven‚Äôt left the house. I regret nothing.
An accurate depiction of my work day‚Ä¶ 
I need many shots tonight. Like all the shots. Not even for Cinco De Mayo, just because today is a hot mess.
@adrnnwllms #getit
@jessmuir0407 Sure man.
@Jessmuir0407 .thumbs up.
@Jessmuir0407 June 13th
@Jessmuir0407 Most of them. Haha
My birthday is in a little over a month. I would like these: 
@jessmuir0407 *hits head on desk*
@jessmuir0407 Oh no, not again.
@marshiebcakes Like, that's the color I wear but like‚Ä¶I'm brown so‚Ä¶
@marshiebcakes Nooooo. That's not real. Please tell me that's not real.
@lafemmeluna That was three years ago!?! Also, most adorable pictures ever.
@emmaswanstan Yep. Drink some of the capri sun, make the straw hole a little bigger, get a cake frosting tip and use that to add tequila.
@kellydirck That's because you're a good person.
You know you can drink every day right? Like, there's nothing stopping you from having tacos and a margarita on any other day of the year?
@emmaswanstan I want a way to keep the pouch intact and get the tequila in. Up your game Buzzfeed.
I think one of the main reasons that Mexicans even partake in Cinco De Mayo in the US is to make dealing with everyone else easier.
I just realized that last night's #JanetheVirgin was the first episode all season to not make me cry. I fear what this means for next week.
‚ÄúI know who the killer is!‚Äù <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Castle_Examiner The dancing killed me. I am done.
Okay, that‚Äôs enough Caskett. That is fucking enough. #Castle
Who the fuck is that lady and why does she sound like Siri? #Castle
No. It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm just like, sweating from my eyeballs. #Castle
@bbygray @evilapprentice Isn't that what you did with Boomie?
@bbygray @evilapprentice Mannnnn. The worst. Time to start making another boom box.
@bbygray @evilapprentice WHY ARE YOU STILL THERE?!
@bbygray @evilapprentice LOL. You okay over there?
Beckett and I rolled our eyes at the same time. Get it together Castle. #Castle

@Jessmuir0407 
@Jessmuir0407 Because of the character assassination of Natasha in AoU
@evilapprentice OMGGGGG. I must stay awake and watch.
@evilapprentice It‚Äôs like S3?!
@vodkalemonades GODDAMMIT
@evilapprentice It's like everyone coming in has never been to a Starbucks before
I'm at the ultimate struggle bus Starbucks. I've never seen people have so much trouble ordering a coffee before.
Life update: cup of noodle broth is fucking disgusting and I regret every life decision that I've ever made.
I just found a cup of noodle in my desk. Going for it. I don‚Äôt even care.
I'm so hungry. I'm about to order pizza to the office and call it a day.
@jessmuir0407 Yeah, the 405 doesn't fucking move. Ever. It's the world's longest parking lot.
I'm beginning to think that I've told so many people at work that I want to lay down on the 405 that they're beginning to not believe me.
@evilapprentice I've had half a Naked juice today. That's it. This is why I'm always sick. Haha
@jessmuir0407 How far did you get?
@jessmuir0407 Girl, you can do that. You're just going to have to overanalyze your point. It's do-able. You just need to step away for a sec
@jessmuir0407 What's the page limit?
@jessmuir0407 Can you think of a day where you were engaged with the discussion? Or can you argue your point to be relevant to a discussion?
@jessmuir0407 Okay. Do you have notes from the class?
@jessmuir0407 And why can't you write about what you wanted to?
@jessmuir0407 What's the paper on?
@jessmuir0407 What's wrong buddy?
@evilapprentice I'm just trying to gather contact info right now and I'm tired and overwhelmed and also want pizza.
Basically, I'm either going to start crying or punch something within in the next hour or so. /rant
The level of anxiety I feel trying to navigate through my work right now is similar to when someone stands too close to me in a market line.
I miss working on a team. I was a fan of the divide and conquer mentality, not this "here's a long list of shit to do all by yourself" thing
@jessmuir0407 Yeah, that's not how that works, haha.
‚Äú@people: #MayThe4thBeWithYou with these Cinco de Mayo cocktails 
@jessiekaiser He is SO AMAZING live. I just saw him at Coachella. He was one of my favorites.
@manamitru I've tried watching every episode at least twice except 4x08 bc I hate it with a fiery passion &amp; just added 7x20 bc all reasons
@manamitru Haha, I think I still only truly hate (like will not watch ever again) about 3. I dislike a lot more.
@manamitru I think before this season I truly only hated like‚Ä¶3 episodes, haha.
@MandyMooreVEVO I regret swiping left tbh. I could‚Äôve used the money.
Mom will not approve the ‚ÄúI want to be single forever and get lots of puppies‚Äù plan so I sent her this‚Ä¶

@roxybebop Whattttt?! Need.
I completely forgot Gracie was still alive tbh. #OrphanBlack
@evilapprentice I legit came home and burst into tears. I got very little work done because every place is packed with people.
@evilapprentice I just tried that and another coffee shop. Internet was too slow. The iTunes Store wouldn't even load.
I have unlimited data and no access to wifi. Let me live, damn you. 
@roxybebop omg wait what is this
I also just want to watch Orphan Black. I mean, I would just settle for that at this point.
I‚Äôm quitting my job &amp; moving to the mountains where I don‚Äôt have to worry about not having internet or being around people to try &amp; get it.
@fembot_nicole Aw love. I‚Äôve been struggling too. I‚Äôm here if you need anything at all &lt;3
@biermann Oh. My. God. This app is the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

Is this how this works? #idk
@ADRNNWLLMS I saw this tweet as Marshella was making it rain expense checks‚Ä¶
@evilapprentice Everyone was convinced that it was going to be in front of the movie, but no one I know has seen it yet. I got lame trailers
@evilapprentice Did they show the Star Wars trailer?
@eugoogolizer It is basically Black Friday to Starbucks employees. My poor brother hates his life whenever there's a happy hour.
In an effort to combat my internet-less, I'm renting movies. Anyone have any recommendations?
@marshiebcakes That got me right in the feels. I've always been really fond of Amelia. I relate to her in all the most terrible ways.
If anyone wants to know how I feel on the daily, please refer to the Amelia/Owen scene from last night's Grey's Anatomy.
@evilapprentice Did you get Star Wars?
@strobelights @thunderoni_ I never saw Star Trek because everyone was just so pissed.
@strobelights @thunderoni_ For real. He's the only thing making me even kind of want to see that movie.
@thunderoni_ @strobelights Everyone was groaning after the Adam Sandler one. Someone literally said "Where the fuck is Star Wars?"
@thunderoni_ @strobelights Oh we had Ant-Man too. Everyone was excited about that one.
@strobelights @thunderoni_ I had Fantastic 4, Tomorrowland and some Adam Sandler movie
@thunderoni_ @strobelights I didn't get it either and I was so sad.
@theonewearing10 A lot of yelling.
@theonewearing10 Yep. Cut out internet for himself and all the floors above him.
@zestitude I definitely had to hold my mouth so I wouldn't make a noise when that happened
@zestitude I did that for Hemsworth‚Ä¶I didn't sit forward very much.
So like‚Ä¶if the tech said my internet is going to be out for half the month, what does that mean for my bill @TWC?
@knackeredwriter Ugh, Tweetdeck. Get your life together. Haha
@evilapprentice I can't stop watching it. All the feelings.
@evilapprentice Uhm, it was the best times tbh.
I know @Jessmuir0407 knows this, but my childhood dream was to be a mariachi. It still is tbh.
@evilapprentice I just had a lot of feelings.

@manamitru What's he graduating from?
@ColleenNel47 @Jessmuir0407 I'm honestly not sure, but I'm choosing to believe it was a dog, haha.
Someone let their dog shit in the elevator. Do better May. Do better.
@Jessmuir0407 I finally watched it with sound. Her little giggle at the end. Stop it.
@Forevercaskett5 It was terribly disgusting but also hilarious.
Long hair problems: I legit just pulled what looked like a small human being out of my sink drain. It was fascinatingly disgusting.
Avengers Tweet Review: Where the fuck was Thor and his glorious arms? I couldn‚Äôt look the vision in the eye. Tight suits. Shit blows up.

@evilapprentice Like, I work in social media. Not having internet? Kinda not an option.
@evilapprentice This option &gt; being at work all the hours
@evilapprentice Sign me up.
Do you know what I get to do now? Peddle for wi-fi all around Los Angeles when it‚Äôs 90-effing degrees outside. THIS IS WHY I WANT A HOUSE.
The guy was literally like ‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt know it would mess up all the lines‚Äù I genuinely almost murdered him on the spot.
Update: The village idiot cut the cables. I‚Äôm not going to have Internet for 3 weeks. Someone put me on suicide watch.
Someone in the building disconnected my internet. 
There have been several police chases this afternoon and I've missed them all. Wtf.

Well, then it's a good thing I'm generally miserable and complaining on social media. #LastRT
@denbac OH GOD.
@denbac Is the Star Wars trailer going to be before it because if so‚Ä¶I will cry. Haha
@evilapprentice I don't like feeling feelings so this is super annoying.
@tmobilehelp No, not really. it was happening  at work, the gym and at home. Today seems to be better, but I haven't been using it much.
@denbac EEEEKKK ME TOO!
@evilapprentice Oh, it's done nothing but make me cry over absolutely nothing because I'm tired and I still can't breathe through my nose.
@evilapprentice #thanksclaritin
Silently rapping Golddigger at my desk. I'm so glad I sit alone in my pod.
@jessmuir0407 I saw someone tweet about dancing and I was like wait what no and then watched it and just melted into a little puddle.
@jessmuir0407 I haven't watched it with sound because I don't want to have a meltdown. Haha
@jessmuir0407 Yep.
@manamitru @evilapprentice It's alright! I make it work. And I get to say #hi whenever I want so‚Ä¶there's perks. Haha
@manamitru @evilapprentice This is why I'm always sick. Haha
@manamitru @evilapprentice As a single person in LA whose rent is half her income, I can only afford $20/week on groceries.
@evilapprentice @manamitru Still. Chris Hemsworth &gt; not eating
@evilapprentice @manamitru Don't be jealous. I paid $17 for a regular movie because that's what is costs here. That's a week of groceries.
@evilapprentice @manamitru Yesss. I wanted to do midnight but I'm an old person so I'm going to the 7pm showing tonight. #yolo
@manamitru YES COME WITH ME. I am SO excited. I wish I felt better but AVENGERS.
@manamitru No sleep. Work. Then going home to my internet-less cave and then going to see The Avengers.
@manamitru I'm like kind of a mess today because I'm tired and super sick and now I just want to lay down on my desk and give up. Haha
omg stopppppppp #Castle
@TMobileHelp It is. I've never had problems, but yesterday service would drop every little while for about 2min, both at work &amp; at home.
I felt no earthquake. You all need to stop drinking in the morning.
@TMobileHelp 90020. I‚Äôm using an iPhone 6.
@vehiclesshockme Ugh, I‚Äôm about to switch everything because TWC is useless.
@Grumpy_Banana .awkward hug.
@TWC_Help I‚Äôve already called and it not fixed. Thanks anyway.
Seriously, I think T-Mobile and Time Warner have conspired against me to make me snap as quickly as possible.
Hey @TMobile, my cell service has been dropping all day and I now don‚Äôt have Internet so I‚Äôm going to need it to stop doing that now.
Uhm, @TWC. Why isn‚Äôt my internet working? You raise my bill and then this? WTF.
OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE?! "I got NorCal! Are You More Northern California Or Southern California? 
@bbygray You had me at burly man with an accent tbh.
@daniellesacco @prancingelites omg that is such a fun video haha
@evilapprentice @bbygray #soulmates
@evilapprentice @bbygray It's 80 degrees outside and I just had soup because I feel like shit. I want banana pudding dammit.
@evilapprentice @bbygray Okay but then like come back and say #hi after. We have margaritas.
@bbygray Grown up decisions are stupid.
Someone send me chicken noodle soup. Yes, I'm aware it's effing hot outside, but I feel like shit.
@evilapprentice Done, done and done.
@evilapprentice I support it tbh.
The time my Mom had me convinced Castle/Beckett we're going to break up because she's horrible 
@evilapprentice It was too easy. I couldn't not do it. I now feel like I'll have to spend my whole day making up for it, haha.
@evilapprentice It's a #hi-atus. Get it? Ha. God, I hate myself.

Three hours after leaving work...#startedfromthebottomnowwerehere 
@TheOneWearing10 I took that way. It was miserable! No giveaway tonight. I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting so many people.
@thunderoni_ This is a mess. And it took 3 hours to get here.
I‚Äôve been trying to get into Dodger Stadium for an hour. I wish I was joking.
@bbygray #getit
@jessmuir0407 Ha. For now.
How is our team falling apart already when we've been playing for less than a month? #Dodgers
Finally getting to #DodgerStadium tonight and all I can think about is all the things I want to eat.
@marshiebcakes Man, they just love Cinco De Mayo. I mean, I love me a drinking holiday but when I try to go out I'm like NOPE.
@marshiebcakes FOR REAL THOUGH.
@aqualice Haha, you sound like my mother.
@jessmuir0407 Okay, perfect.
@jessmuir0407 I am. This is all hypothetical.
If I ever get married, King Taco is catering and you're all invited. And I'm getting mariachis because that's just what you do.
Bringing the hood life to the west side...#thebox #wheresmytacoemoji 
‚ÄúGood morning beautiful‚Äù It‚Äôs almost noon, bro. Noon. Like, I‚Äôve already ordered lunch.
@jessmuir0407 The only reason I did it is because I'm splitting with a coworker.
@jessmuir0407 Yep. $18 delivery fee for $15 worth of food.
.@Postmates, when you want to pay more to have someone bring you food than you paid for the actual food. Good lord.
The best thing about all this is I will have to be up and awake at work in a few hours when I can barely stand up in my own right now.
I forgot to drug myself to sleep, so here I am at 2am, laying on the bathroom floor crying.
@bbygray @evilapprentice Ugh, my sweet Alias. Did me so right, but then so, so wrong.
@Castle_Examiner I did too actually. I didn‚Äôt think I would, but I did.
Awww, Alba. #JaneTheVirgin
Anddddd I‚Äôm in tears. Again. Because I haven‚Äôt gotten through a damn episode this season without crying. #JaneTheVirgin
I think it's time we push Petra's mother down the stairs. #JaneTheVirgin
Fun Fact: I used to tell the priest long stories in confession just so I could be in there longer and freak my Grandma out. #JaneTheVirgin
I would like to think I'm a lot like Jane, but I'm basically Luisa so...that's concerning. #JaneTheVirgin
I seriously ask myself "How would Rogelio act?" in daily situations. I'm better for it. #JaneTheVirgin
#ThankGoodnessForSpaceScience #JaneTheVirgin
Let‚Äôs keep the good episodes going shall we? #JaneTheVirgin time!
@bbygray I don't think I've ever gotten so mad watching an episode. I'm usually neutral but holy moly. And I REALLY miss Beckett.
@bbygray I did enjoy the case quite a bit, but definitely missed Beckett. And I don‚Äôt think I could hate anything more than last week.
@bbygray Nope, not once.
@DaraCreasey That was a really fun episode! I loved the case. Next time, less snakes and more Beckett. <WINKING FACE>
AW MAN, I thought for sure it was Jim. #Castle
@DaraCreasey You‚Äôre so good with the plot twists dude. Props.
Every time I hear a goat, I laugh. I don‚Äôt know what my problem is.
I‚Äôm telling you guys, Jim did it. #Castle
Ahahahah. No one noticed the suspicious woman wearing sunglasses the entire flight? #Castle
@bbygray I‚Äôm in LA so it‚Äôs always time for Sangria. We had it delivered to the office once from the Mexican restaurant across the street.
@evilapprentice @bbygray Get your tent ready Shana. We're having a party.
@bbygray #worthit
@bbygray TOTES IN!
@DaraCreasey I see your Indiana Jones reference and raise you NO MORE SNAKES.
NO MORE SNAKES DAMMIT #Castle
@bbygray Uhm, I am so game.
This episode and @bbygray are making me want to watch Bridesmaids.
I miss Beckett. #Castle
@DaraCreasey #HINOPE
Does it count as a banana split if there‚Äôs no ice cream but I have everything else?
@bbygray This is the 90s.
Jim (?) the flight attendant totally killed him. #Castle
Let's talk about the killer on speakerphone. That won't draw attention. #getittogetherguys #Castle
I can barely get Facebook to load when I‚Äôm on a flight. How are they using FaceTime? #Castle
@bbygray Recently, I haven‚Äôt paid attention to any scenes she‚Äôs not in, but this one is actually keeping my attention.
@DaraCreasey His name could have been His Majesty Stephan of Canada and I still would want no business with him. No snakes. Not ever.
I miss Beckett, but I‚Äôm WAY more interested in this ep than I have been in the last few. I actually don‚Äôt remember any recent cases. #Castle
Really @DaraCreasey? You had to throw a snake in there. *shudder* #Castle
I mean, theoretically there probably was an actual cop on that plane. #Castle
I love when realtors lose their shit on House Hunters. Also, this just in: I‚Äôm going to die alone with cats eating my face.

Someone come hang out with me on Restoration Hardware's roof later. I need fresh air and a buddy.
I need a drink and to go like‚Ä¶meditate on top of a hill or something.
@katrak @manamitru Yep.
@lafemmeluna YES PLEASE
@katrak lol omg
I want Chrissy Teigen's job of just being a hype girl on Lip Sync battle. How do I get in on that?
@evilapprentice It's never affected my life, luckily.
@evilapprentice IT CHANGES EVERYTHING SHANA DONT YOU UNDERSTAND
@evilapprentice Our fucks were taken from us, cloned and put into others who have too many fucks to give. Duh.

You know that Community GIF when the guy walks in with a pizza and everything is on fire? That‚Äôs basically my timeline and I right now.

I'm convinced World War III is happening in my body right now so I'm listening to Oprah speak &amp; thinking about how much I want tacos.
@elmerspears Complaints when we don't get one. Complaints when we do get one. I'm over it.
@mandapandalovee The Zombie apocalypse is real man.
@evilapprentice Yep, 100%. If I can make it through the day without crying or throwing up, it'll be a good day.
@evilapprentice No, that was last weekend. This weekend I tried going on a hike with half functioning lungs.
It is excruciatingly painful to sit in a desk chair right now and I've taken all the medicine that I can. This is going to be a long day.
@manamitru Happy Birthday!

These stupid Apple Watch ads are making me want one and I absolutely don‚Äôt need one.
#MadMen is totally giving me anxiety.

@CarrieCornish how cute is that?!
@vodkalemonades Still waiting for science to cure death for Vin
@vodkalemonades Vin isn't calling today, sadly. I think he's only calling home and SF now.
@vodkalemonades No, it's the same. He said. Haha
@vodkalemonades I think it was maybe in the high 40s/low 50s? Haha. I was there. I was cold‚Ä¶but like‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the same.
@vodkalemonades A Dodgers announcer compared a rain delay a few years ago to Nov in Green Bay &amp; I thought you would appreciate that haha
When ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do anything I wouldn‚Äôt do‚Äù is literally the worst advice to give a friend. Little Rebel Angie has seen it ALL.

Hi, I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶Brandon is your name? #BruceJennerABC
Kris is honestly such an insufferable human being.
@FlyersAndGiants That light, that complete shift in someone when they reveal their truth; it‚Äôs honestly magical. I remember it in my bro.

@Jessmuir0407 You laugh now until they do the same thing on Castle lol

@evilapprentice I feel like I'm going backwards on one of those airport walkway things. That's what my life is right now.
@miss_tenenbaum Haha, just fandom things. I'm trying to be zen and am like‚Ä¶c'mon bros. Help me out here.
@evilapprentice I'm over it &amp; by over it, I mean I'm pretending it never happened. Like 6x23. I'm in a much more peaceful place. Also booze.

@evilapprentice I'm just like, do better. That's all. I'm over it, it's done but just‚Ä¶do better.
@evilapprentice I don't mind her (ducks) but I don't really care for this season which apparently means I should stop watching all together.
@evilapprentice I'm just tired of reading how I'm a horrible person because I don't like something or don't want to see how it plays out.
@evilapprentice I keep opening tumblr today and then scroll through a few posts and am like‚Ä¶nah, I'm good.
@laurenleialoha I will walk to the damn burger if I have to, tbh.

@flamingovision I really wanted an explanation that wasn‚Äôt going to be so far-fetched but that didn‚Äôt happen. Haha

@bbygray Only on the ones that end in Y.
Now for the big question...do I make a mug cake or should I just eat this canned whipped cream on its own?
@manamitru @evilapprentice Like after seeing that I'm like oh yeah girl, I get it. You do you.
@elmerspears @Jessmuir0407 I wish I felt differently, I really do, but the show just isn't doing it for me anymore. It's like it's confused.
@elmerspears @Jessmuir0407 And I don't. I want it done because another whole season of this would drive me absolutely nuts.
@elmerspears @Jessmuir0407 Like I said, it's like they're trying to force a puzzle piece and be like LOOK ITS DONE I DID IT.
@Forevercaskett5 @Jessmuir0407 @elmerspears I didn't like it. I think they did.
@Jessmuir0407 @elmerspears It‚Äôs left me wanting to bump the show to ‚ÄúI‚Äôll watch on the weekend when I‚Äôm bored‚Äù status.
@Jessmuir0407 It was horrible. I was mildly intrigued and once they really explained it I was literally side-eyeing the TV.
@evilapprentice and now I‚Äôm like OH THANK GOD ITS ON
@evilapprentice Oh, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love me some DWTS and our national treasure Patti. I just used to watch this to kill time‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm being grumpy as fuck but I‚Äôve slept no hours and I miss the desert where people hide contraband in their pants and things make sense.
Patti LaBelle was just dancing with one shoe and it was more enthralling than that episode. And probably the season.
@bbygray I‚Äôm so genuinely annoyed right now. Like, I‚Äôm watching DWTS and it‚Äôs a relief. We‚Äôve reached that point.
@Jessmuir0407 That was just‚Ä¶ugh. Just end it. I‚Äôm over it.
I think this episode is why this emoji was created: <UNAMUSED FACE> #Castle
My stream died and I don‚Äôt even care. #Castle
This episode feels like when you lose a piece of a puzzle and you try just jamming another one into the empty space to get it done. #Castle
Okay but like‚Ä¶if I was putting a team together to get into some crazy shit‚Ä¶I would have kidnapped Beckett, not Castle. #Castle

This episode should have happened sometime in like..October. I'm on Esposito's side. Kate looks great. Those are my thoughts. #Castle
@evilapprentice I was going to mention that...I ran out of characters.
@evilapprentice This feels like when you're on one of the spinning playground things and it's been too long and you're just like nope. Done.
@evilapprentice Yep.
The kind of assignments they‚Äôre getting in the precinct is like the kind we get when we look like we don‚Äôt have enough work to do. #Castle

@manamitru omgggg
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 What? I‚Äôm not allowed to want cake?
@ashtonsage YAY!! I had some of these on my list but I needed more daytime bands so this is perfect! Thank you! <TWO HEARTS>
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 and dammit I could totally go for cake
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 Yeah, there was nothing that I could see. I also got a green light for once so I didn‚Äôt look very hard.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 drove past. Didn‚Äôt see any kind of production at all.
@ashtonsage FRIEND! I need Coachella recommendations!
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 I borrowed my friend's dog to walk around the church that one time‚Ä¶that was fun.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 I'm not getting out of the car so, I'll be fine.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I'll look. I told Mariana I'm not leaving work for hours, but I check it out on the way home.
@bbygray Yes! Please. All the drinks.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 When they filmed the baby episode it was like oh, they're at the church. There's nothing around that I can think of
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru It's just like a neighborhood. There's really nothing around.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôll drive by since its on my way home. THATS IT. (Also that won‚Äôt be for another like 4 hours so‚Ä¶yeah)
@manamitru LOL. That's literally 4 blocks away from me. I hate my life.
@bbygray That's awesome. I'm so happy for you. Send some my way man. I need it, haha.
@bbygray I've never been more jealous of your life. Ever.
@kellydirck HAPPY BIRTHDAY! &lt;3
@jessmuir0407 The only smoothies we have at work have strawberries in them. It's a suicide mission.
About one more urgent email away from making a smoothie tbh
@adrnnwllms Girl no. You are better than that.
So, that's how my week is going.
I warned co-workers to stop me if they see me making a smoothie in the kitchen because it most likely has berries and is a suicide mission.
@evilapprentice It's okay. I forgive you.
@evilapprentice Brand new information. My world has been shaken.
@evilapprentice WAIT. You're Jewish!?
I actually feel very car sick now. That was a lot of bad decisions in a very short amount of time.
I should have least gotten two slices tbh
@thunderoni_ That was so beautiful.
Remember that time I paid $20 to have a Lyft take me to get a $3 slice of pizza because I didn‚Äôt want to park? Tax return, being put to use.
My mission got aborted so I got Two Boots. Fun times.
@evilapprentice Haha, just casually show up demanding a boombox?
I cannot believe I've been talked into this...
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 @evilapprentice Haha, I wouldn't go if I actually thought I would be killed.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 @evilapprentice Haha, I have watermelons!
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 @evilapprentice Not yet, gonna call him in a bit. I can't believe I am actually going with this.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 @evilapprentice I swear, if I go down there and nothing is going on, I'm sending you my Uber bill.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 @evilapprentice it's at like...30%
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru @evilapprentice How long are they even going to be there?
@manamitru @evilapprentice @Jessmuir0407 .....I'm waiting for my phone to charge.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @Jessmuir0407 OMG SHANA WHO ASKED YOU
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 I still have work to do but you bastards are convincing me to charge my phone and go down there.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 I seriously almost went down there after work for the very reason you mentioned but I really did have work to do
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 hahaha oh my god this is the most intense guilt trip and it's working and I hate myself
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru NO ITS NOT
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 STOP MAKING THIS SOUND LIKE A GOOD IDEA
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 The Uber sounds like a relatively good idea but no. Job applications dammit!
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 LOL. Oh my god. You guys are actually serious.
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru Dudes. I have to get dressed. Drive there. FIND PARKING. And maybe I get to see a thing. Maybe I feel creepy.
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru It feels creepy standing there &amp; watching them work. I did it once &amp; it was fun but I was so uncomfortable. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru I thought about it. I really did. I just hate feeling creepy.
@manamitru @Jessmuir0407 I am in pajamas. I am not driving downtown. I can barely convince myself to work on these job applications. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 That's really far away. Ok, it's not far at all. It's literally 10 minutes away. But no.
@Jessmuir0407 What's going on?
@RJalias Florence. She posted about it earlier. She broke it during her set!
Florence‚Äôs set went from nearly an hour to 30 minutes for weekend two. Damn that broken foot.
Vaguely tempted to go downtown, but then I remember I don't drive downtown I have work to do and I also have a trip to prepare for.
@amandaleon @flo_tweet MY FAVORITE
@jessmuir0407 I was hoping it would all go away with the next episode tbh. Haha. Oh well, we shall see.
@jessmuir0407 I just don't know man, haha.
@evilapprentice I must say, I didn‚Äôt have queso until I was an adult and there is a severe lack of it in LA
@evilapprentice wtf is moe's
@evilapprentice I should have gotten BBQ. That mediocre Chipotle is really doing something to my mood.
@evilapprentice BBQ
@evilapprentice Please. I live the hood life. I just need to keep my evil on the DL.
@evilapprentice I mean, you don't have evil in your name for no reason‚Ä¶
@evilapprentice I mean, I try to live on the positive/relatively indifferent side of things but I am basically the scoff emoji right now.
@evilapprentice <UNAMUSED FACE>

A million thank you's to the #CoachellaAngel for helping me get my hands on this little beauty.‚Ä¶ 
@evilapprentice I'll miss you. Say #hi for me when you have a chance. Tell Boomie of my adventures.

@vivalaswedes I was trying to figure out who to see this weekend and all I could find was Madonna and Drake. And then I threw up.
@Jessmuir0407 Ah, I see.

@Jessmuir0407 Why?
@Dani_andthearts Right in the feels. Ugh.

I‚Äôm pretty sure someone has eavesdropped on my family‚Äôs kitchen conversations and used it for this kitchen scene. #JaneTheVirgin
Aw yes, #JaneTheVirgin time!
Sometimes, you just dance along to DWTS in the living room.
Attn Dodgers: I‚Äôm not paying for MLB TV to watch you lose. Get it together.
@chadgcreasey I think I had a a solid 5 minute conversation with the one in my lot the other night so‚Ä¶no?
@betro I started to write a reply and was just getting so pissed off and upset that I gave up.
@mspt2000 Exactly.
@mspt2000 Oh, those women who wear shorts &amp; bikini tops in 100 degree weather deserve to deal with this guy: 
My cousin just made a "she was asking for it" comment on Facebook and I'm really about to just drag his ass. One moment please.
@marshiebcakes Awesome! Hopefully I can find the time to hit up a Sephora before Friday!
@marshiebcakes OOOO! I LOVE that one! I would wear that all the time tbh.
@marshiebcakes Oh man, that orange‚Ä¶I need. This is honestly the only time of year that I wear anything bright. Haha
@marshiebcakes Speaking of Coachella, I need fun lip color suggestions for this weekend‚Ä¶haha
@evilapprentice @bbygray I'm honestly amazed you were able to deliver Boomie and make your flight.
@evilapprentice @bbygray Arrange a custody swap.
@evilapprentice @bbygray I will liberate him if I have to.
@evilapprentice @bbygray when is his birthday?
@evilapprentice @bbygray I was totes at the Chipotle where Boomie was conceived on Thursday night.
@evilapprentice @bbygray Dammit.
@evilapprentice Can I borrow yours?
‚Ä¶And then I drive to Indio praying the rosary and hoping I don‚Äôt get stranded in the desert.
It‚Äôs time for Ed‚Äôs semi-annual Coachella tune-up, where the mechanics tell me 50 things that are wrong and I can only get 1 fixed.
Semi-radio silence this week. I need to work and I need to be away from my timeline.
Drake. Quit talking. Music. Now.
@emmaswanstan They‚Äôre AMAZING live. One of my favorites.
@RJalias His set is convincing me to see him next week. That tent is terrifying but SO fun.
@RJalias It is heaven on earth. I love it so much. I'm so excited for next week.
Hey @coachella, channel three is all kinds of fucked up. Fix please. Thanks.
I can't deal with the perfection of @flo_tweet. I just can't. She's an angel.
@bbygray @evilapprentice See? #hisoul
@bbygray I think my soul might be in your dog.
@bbygray Oh yeah, he‚Äôs totally an LA dog. Poor little dude. Rain is hard times for us all.
@bbygray He's like aw that's a bummer you're stuck and I'm sorry but yolo
@bbygray Deal. I want a big dog to pull me out of the rubble.
@bbygray Earthquakes never bothered me until I lived alone and was like oh great, I'm gonna die and no one will know.

I‚Äôm just flat out sobbing during this Florence and the Machine set and I don‚Äôt even care. #Coachella
So, we all want Peggy to hook up with that woman right? #MadMen
Ugh, Harry is gross. #MadMen

@betro I may need to come hang out with you and the puppies on a weekly basis kthx. Also, GOT TONIGHT.
@Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôm glad my Mom has loosened up since realizing she has a gay son and three fiercely feminist children. Haha
@betro I would like Bayer to sponsor my life until next November.
@Jessmuir0407 My family is fairly liberal, but my extended family‚Ä¶oh lord. I tend to just keep quiet because I don‚Äôt want to go to jail.
@evilapprentice Also, arguing over Facebook is just... .puts all people on mute until November 2016.
@evilapprentice I mean, I don't care who people vote for, that's their right but at least be a decent, educated human being.
Also ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for her because she‚Äôs an ugly old hag‚Äù and then saying ‚Äúpeople need to educate themselves‚Äù‚Ä¶I enjoy the human race.
I‚Äôve already seen at least three people on Facebook call Hillary a cunt, so‚Ä¶this is going to be a fun year a half of social media.
@betro It must have been open bar.
@betro I just. I mean. Girl. You have all the resources at your disposal, why are you stealing FedEx‚Äôs logo?
@RJalias It looks like the FedEx logo.
@Jessmuir0407 Yes, haha.
@Jessmuir0407 Hideous. But I'm willing to let it pass. For now.
@DanielleSacco I LOVE THAT STARBUCKS
@MarshieBCakes It‚Äôs like c‚Äômon boo, you‚Äôre better than this knock off FedEx logo.
Hillary, we gotta work on that logo. It‚Äôs not working for me.
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru Thank you for your support.
I considered buying digital copies of the movies because I was too lazy to take out the box set. I am what‚Äôs wrong with this generation.
I‚Äôm watching Star Wars and eating Star Wars mac n‚Äô cheese because I am the best adult that ever lived.
@Jessmuir0407 Haha, no I'm alright. I'm gonna try and suck it up and go to the store. I need a couple other things.
@Jessmuir0407 a couple bucks
@Jessmuir0407 I do, I just don't want to pay for it. It's like $8 to deliver, haha.
@Jessmuir0407 The boy is at Coachella. That was my best shot.
@Jessmuir0407 No, I'm too weak to drive so I'm just living off water. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 Ugh, seriously. The end is near.
@Jessmuir0407 I slept most of yesterday and all last night. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up.
@Jessmuir0407 I saw. I just can't be bothered to care. I feel worse today than I did yesterday.
How is there drama on a Sunday? Good lord.
@msxdx Sunday is a little less hard. The big decision there is do I want to drive back at 2am alone to go to work at 8am. Haha
@msxdx I literally am so fucked up over this conflict. I don't know what to do! I love them all! COME WITH ME. HELP ME.
@Abigail_Hope_ All the drugs probably haha
I need to have a chat with the person who put Jack White, Tycho and Deorro at the same time and that needs to not happen next weekend.
Of course I‚Äôm deathly ill the week going into Coachella. I‚Äôve slept most of the day and still feel miserable. Send pedialyte and watermelon.
@thunderoni_ He'll be alright. Best get theses weird games out of the way now than in the fall.
@thunderoni_ I know! I forgot to pick some up at the store! Coachella is gonna be rough next week. No heat stroke 2k15!
@Dani_andthearts And Mouse Rat, obviously.
@thunderoni_ I napped through most because dehydration is kicking my ass but every time I would hear the score‚Ä¶<BROKEN HEART>
.puts Duke Dumont on next week‚Äôs Coachella watch list.
@thunderoni_ :(
@Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôve been busy hustling for Coachella man. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 FINALLY watched this. Love it. Can't wait.
Indio, I will see you next weekend! Bless the #CoachellaAngel for working it out for me!
If anyone wants to donate to the ‚ÄúAngie can‚Äôt afford Coachella but needs to be outside surrounded by music‚Äù fund, that would be sweet.
@kellydirck You HAVE to. Because then people will expect you to adult and this weekend it‚Äôs like FUCK THAT IM IN MY 20‚Ä≤S!
@kellydirck all the alcohol is the only way out man
.gets dehydrated working outside. .drinks 3 margaritas to recover.
Happy #NationalSiblingDay to my little brothers. I am the luckiest girl alive to have such‚Ä¶ 
#HappyCoachella
Remember how when I‚Äôm tired I cry over weird things? Yep, that‚Äôs happening.
@CarrieCornish where/what time?
@manamitru Me too. I'm exhausted and a little grumpy so I was happy to see them.
@manamitru <PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART>
I haven‚Äôt eaten all day so‚Ä¶#hi Chipotle.
@Jessmuir0407 That sounds crazy.
@Jessmuir0407 Holy shit.
@Jessmuir0407 tornados?
RIP #LAKings
So, what did I miss today?
In honor of opening week, I present the kidling at her very first Dodger game. #raiseemright #tbt @‚Ä¶ 
@ellamatronic omg yessss
I added ‚Äúnon-Dodger fans need not apply‚Äù to my tinder bio to save myself a lot of time and trouble. It‚Äôs working.
VIVA MEXICO #Dodgers
#UltimateBae #PizzaPartay @ Little Bangladesh 
Sweet, sweet pizza liberation. #USAUSA #ThanksDominos 
@pho_fur no probs! Enjoy!
Oh. Puig. #Dodgers
@Jessmuir0407 Ugh. This is unfortunate.
@pho_fur If you can stream it on your computer, just install hola unblock and it'll let you watch the game.
@pho_fur It‚Äôs not on ESPN?!
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the mold or lack of food, but I am definitely not feeling great.
@pho_fur True. You‚Äôre excused. Also, this unblocking MLBTV was the best thing I ever did. I‚Äôve missed these stupid faces.
@pho_fur ‚Ä¶gurl
@cithrins Ugh. Gross. Never again.
@Lexification03 Yep! She is most delightful!
@Lexification03 Yep. I've done it too. Friend is having a bad day, send them pizza. ITS NOT THAT SERIOUS BROS.
@Jessmuir0407 Bc my friend was having it delivered to my house as a nice gesture and since she's not here yet, they wouldn't give it to me
@Lexification03 so now I'm ordering Dominos.
@Lexification03 and they wouldn't give it to me because I didn't order it. She even called them and told them it was okay and they wouldn't.
@Lexification03 I don't have food in the house and my friend is staying over, so she ordered a pizza to get delivered ahead of time
After three phone calls and 20 minutes, @PizzaHut will not liberate our pizza. I think my time with them is about done.
The saga continues‚Ä¶ #HostagePizza 
Lauren was nice and ordered me a pizza for dinner so I wouldn‚Äôt starve and now @PizzaHut is holding it hostage. @Dominos FTW.
@evilapprentice I'm allergic to penicillin. #RIPAngie
@RJalias @Jessmuir0407 Indeed I did.
@RJalias @Jessmuir0407 Apparently, it‚Äôs not, haha.
@Jessmuir0407 Right, but it obviously wasn‚Äôt that much or noticeable if I was still drinking out of the cup.
@Jessmuir0407 I just want to know HOW dangerous it is‚Ä¶
Today, in things Angie wishes she didn‚Äôt have to Google‚Ä¶‚ÄúIs it safe to drink out of a cup that has mold in it?‚Äù
@miss_tenenbaum Where in LA?
@biermann Run bro.
@BRCustServ It was Laura from the Westside Pavilion store in Los Angeles. Very sweet and very helpful.
I find this feeling of drowning while sitting at my desk that is not anywhere near water very unsettling. #sendhelp
@evilapprentice @manamitru <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@manamitru @evilapprentice We thought it would be funny...at the time. And then she came in and we asked her to be in it and she was haha
@evilapprentice @manamitru Random fact: I was in a Call Me Maybe video with her when I was at Disney. My life is weird.
@manamitru lol what is happening
I‚Äôm so nervous, I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out.
‚ÄúWe mustn‚Äôt dwell. No, not today. We can‚Äôt. Not on Rex Manning day!‚Äù
@evilapprentice hahahah it sounds delightful!
@evilapprentice sportsball blue
@msxdx Have so much fun! Be safe! Bring me a cookie! Hahah
@evilapprentice I just wanted to eat so I don‚Äôt pass out saying #hi tomorrow.
Okay, maybe don‚Äôt not eat all day and then scarf down an entire bowl of fried rice. #ow
@MarshieBCakes NOPE. No. No.
@DodgersReddit I‚Äôm in West LA. It‚Äôs sprinkling for the most part. We‚Äôve had a few moments of real rain.
@jessmuir0407 Thanks boo!
@jessmuir0407 Yep
My most kind and delightful humans, send me your most positive vibes over the next couple of days. Hoping for some spring magic...
@miss_tenenbaum super cute!
@sanniel Sammeeee. I was ready but was still like OH SHIT. Also, I cried at least twice.
@4x07 I watched 4x07 the other day and I'm honestly still in awe of it's perfection.
@4x07 Yessss! And seriously, if you don't want to watch after 3x13, I don't want to talk to you.
I just had the most patient and delightful @BananaRepublic worker. Thanks for helping a short person find the perfect dress pants.
These next two weeks are going to be a whirlwind. I am not prepared.
@jessmuir0407 Nooooo. Want.
@msxdx Have a safe flight my love!
@cithrins yep
Wait, no. Now I‚Äôm bawling. #JaneTheVirgin
#JaneTheVirgin is now 17-17 in making me cry during episodes.
I am so about this bromance. #JaneTheVirgin
Was the last episode really at Paley? Good lord. Let‚Äôs get to it then! #JaneTheVirgin
@Abigail_Hope_ Only because of who you‚Äôre rooting for <WINKING FACE>
@4x07 It really is. I love all of those episodes so much. 3x14 was the one where I was like oh okay I‚Äôm hooked
Who am I supposed to be rooting for here? #NCAAChampionship
@4x07 Ugh, those are so good! But 3x14 is my all-time favorite.
I actually feel dizzy right now. There has been too much excitement in the last hour. Spring, let's keep this going, yes?
@katrak WUUTTTT
@pho_fur IDK IDK IT'S ALL CONFUSING.
@pho_fur But like, couldn't he do that even before he was on the Padres?
I 100% stand by my comments. I will go nowhere near Angel Stadium. There's not enough screaming in Spanish there. #LastRT
God, that felt good. I've missed this baseball high. I need to get to Dodger stadium ASAP. #OpeningDayLA
‚Äú@Dodgers: FINAL: #Dodgers 6, Padres 3. #OpeningDayLA‚Äù YESSSSSS
@rjalias That would be so epic. But only if we won.
FUCK YESSSSSSSSS #OpeningDayLA
‚Äú@SportsCenter: Red Sox launch five homers in 8-0 win over Phillies. Hanley Ramirez hits 2 HR, with 9th inning grand slam.‚Äù Ugh.
‚Äú@alannarizzo: I miss the HR bubble machine.  #Dodgers‚Äù Co-Signed.
Okay Howie, I see you trying. I appreciate it. #OpeningDayLA
@pho_fur DUDE 
WHOA WHOA WHOA. Someone just posted a picture of an apparent Dole Whip at Dodger Stadium. I'm going to need an immediate confirmation.
Oh good, Gonzalez didn‚Äôt change his song. Viva Mexico. #OpeningDayLA
My stream is at least 2ish pitches behind what's actually happening. #OpeningDayLA
@marshiebcakes Gawd.
Current Status: In a serious relationship with Clayton Kershaw's curve ball. #OpeningDayLA #ITFDB 
YES CLAP FOR MATT. Okay, now strike him out. #OpeningDayLA
CLAYTON KERSHAW'S CURVEBALL IS ORGASMIC. GET OVER IT. #OpeningDayLA
*deep breath* Here we go people. I'm not sorry for anything I scream in caps from now to October. #OpeningDayLA #ITFDB
Whatever. I'm listening to the radio and my precious Vin because it's already bad enough that I'm not there.
@pho_fur omg co-signed
I get that the game will begin shortly @MLBTV, but you're making me nervous now. Show me my boys damn you. You have two minutes.
@marshiebcakes @mlbtv I want pre-game festivities in front on my eyes NOW
Also, why is @MLBTV not working yet? Get it the hell together man.
My sweet prince, I miss you already. #LastRT #OpeningDayLA
@jessmuir0407 Well, right‚Ä¶Haha
@jessmuir0407 Haha, why?
@jessmuir0407 I saw
@jessmuir0407 Exactly. I like it.
@jessmuir0407 Oh, I like that.
@jessmuir0407 Where?
@pho_fur *LAUGHS TURN INTO SOBS* I legit may work from the Mexican restaurant across the street so I can watch, I don't even care.
@jessmuir0407 I remember seeing the fans when we swept them in the playoffs in 04? God, they looked so sad. I just had to hug them.
I had to wear my Josh Beckett shirt because wearing my Kemp shirt hurts too much and I don't have money to buy a new one. #BaseballProblems
@pho_fur ITS BACK ITS BACK ITS BACK!
@jessmuir0407 I have a soft spot for the Cubs, you're fine. Haha
If you aren't wearing Dodger blue today, consider us mortal enemies until the fall. #OpeningDayLA
I can‚Äôt even think about how I‚Äôm not going to be at opening day because it physically hurts.
Hey @DanielleSacco, check my last RT because‚Ä¶life.
I am infinitely attracted to Stan and I don‚Äôt even care. #MadMen
A solid Photoshop ad placement during Mad Men. #knowyouraudience
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you offer to take me to Paris?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause I can‚Äôt even get you to get dressed to go to dinner‚Äù #touche
@bebravelive Same. I kept playing it for everyone so they could know the joy.
@bebravelive Also, I‚Äôm never going to get this song back out of my head again.
@bebravelive LOL IGGY. Omg. Brilliant.
@bebravelive SHOW ME
DRAG THEM JOAN. CMON. #MadMen
RACHEL! #MadMen
@CarrieCornish Jealous of her life tbh
Roger looks like Colonel Sanders. What in the actual hell? #MadMen
@jessiekaiser lololol right?! The alcohol is not helping
STOP USING THE CAROUSEL SPEECH IT HURTS ME #MadMen
#MadMen time!
@MarshieBCakes Yes! I had barely shut the door when I got home and was like NO PANTS! Pants are dumb. Haha.
@Jessmuir0407 When is it going to be done? I'll go then, haha.
@MarshieBCakes The boy wanted to go out to a nice Easter dinner and I was like no I don't want to wear pants and baseball is on so oh well
@Jessmuir0407 DUMB. If they ever made any big changes to Dodger stadium, there would be riots.
@Jessmuir0407 Are they going to put them back?
@Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôve always wanted to go there, I‚Äôve never been. I want to go to all the stadiums, but I REALLY want to see Wrigley.
@pho_fur I don‚Äôt know what shirt to wear tomorrow because my favorite one is his player shirt <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Jessmuir0407 I JUST SAW. WTF. That's fucked up. That makes me so sad.
@Jessmuir0407 That‚Äôs the plan. I‚Äôm never giving it up again.
@bebravelive I finally feel like myself again.
@evilapprentice I now corrupt the youth of the family so that they may carry on the tradition when my liver fails.
I just ate an entire canister of Pringles while drinking a beer. Lent is over and my life is in shambles.
@evilapprentice I have to have something during TV hiatus time. Plus, I am the only girl in my family. It started as a survival method.
@evilapprentice I tend to be somewhat abrasive towards everyone once baseball season starts. And when football overlaps‚Ä¶whew.
@Jessmuir0407 Tomorrow when I‚Äôm sober and we lose, I‚Äôll be back to my cynical self.
@Jessmuir0407 I've been drinking all day, let me be delirious.
@pho_fur I‚Äôm watching this in disbelief that baseball season is already here. I‚Äôm still trying to process that Matt is a Padre.
Stop letting the Cardinals score runs. Do something right, Cubs. You have a fresh start.
@evilapprentice Indeed. #frenemies
Tomorrow, @browncrayon and I become mortal enemies. #BaseballisComing

<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> #OpeningNight 
What the hell is going on with baseball?
Noon. I‚Äôve drank a pitcher of mimosas. I regret absolutely nothing.
@DanielleSacco NO WE CANT SISTER WHAT ARE YOU A HEATHEN?
@REMOVEYOURPANTS Ah yes. We meet again. *raises glass* I respectfully hope you all lose. *downs mimosa*
I've never been so happy for an Easter in my entire life. Hello mimosas...my sweet, delicious‚Ä¶ 
Me getting up at 6am for mass‚Ä¶ #CatholicProblems #HappyEaster 
8am mass tomorrow. 8am. Is this a joke?
@bloodlesscoup I wish mine was.
Abby: ‚ÄúMan‚Ä¶I hope I don‚Äôt die tomorrow.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat? Why would you say that?!‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joke. I like to make jokes whenever I drink lemonade.‚Äù
Happy Easter! #MySunshine 
#MySunshine at her gymnastics Easter egg hunt. Two seconds after this picture, she totally fell on‚Ä¶ 
My Aunt told me I can‚Äôt wear black to Easter mass. I don‚Äôt think she realizes she just eliminated all of my wardrobe options.
Don and Peggy dancing. I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm great. Don‚Äôt talk to me. #MadMen
Ugh, Megan sucks. #MadMen
Peggy is in charge. I dream of that day, you guys don‚Äôt understand. #MadMen
I finally cleaned all the expired food out of my fridge. The only remaining thing is cheese and wine. #legit
@CarrieCornish lol, I just thought the same thing.
‚ÄúSo, is this what your job is like?‚Äù ‚ÄúKind of. There‚Äôs more computers and less alcohol.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds horrible.‚Äù #MadMen
There's literally no one on my floor. I could watch Mad Men in the conference room while doing cartwheels and it wouldn't matter a bit.
@evilapprentice Oh man, that banana pudding. I need to learn to make it. I will find a way.
@evilapprentice Ugh, seriously man. If I wasn't going to be off four days in the next two weeks, I would have just left.
My boss won't leave which means I can't leave which means I can't leave and I haven't gotten an email in three hours.
I just realized I wasted my big fasting-break meal on Subway. What the hell is wrong with me? PIZZA. ALWAYS EAT PIZZA TO BREAK FAST.
@bbygray That sounds like how I prep to be around my family.
@mspt2000 This is the only reason I'm not (completely) bitchy about having to work today. I'll get home quick.
My friend just named our group conversation"Pup N Suds". This is why we're friends.
Listening to Florence's MTV Unplugged while being forever bitter that I can't just throw down all the money to go to her show.
$60 tickets going for over $200. I've said it before and I'll say it again‚Ä¶I fucking HATE ticket scalpers.
@katrak God, I loved this scene so much. Haha
I miss my old, good health insurance. One call and bam. Appointments everywhere. None of this yelp business required.
I think I'm going to have better luck finding a non-hood apartment than finding a decent therapist in Los Angeles. Jfc. This is tedious.
@Jessmuir0407 Man, I keep waiting. I‚Äôm getting impatient.
@MarshieBCakes Dude, mine are all fucked up because I‚Äôm too broke and lazy to go get them done haha
@Jessmuir0407 Crazy right?
Everyone else- all of the other numbers #Scandal
@Jessmuir0407 Not when TV gets this good it‚Äôs not.
SHIITTTTTTTTT #Scandal
@MarshieBCakes crazy jealous of your eyebrow game haha
Yes, The Avengers still doesn't come out for another month and yes, I'm still texting my friend about what showing she wants to go to.
#PeepsJousting is getting out of control this year.
@evilapprentice Very true, very very true. Emotionally scarred, but in a good way.
@evilapprentice SAME
@evilapprentice The first episode I ever saw was the S3 finale. I should have known then the finales would never leave me okay.
@evilapprentice My trust issues will never be repaired after that.
@evilapprentice And I did. And it still wasn't enough.
@evilapprentice I always watch the finales spoiler free and I remember half of my friends texting me like‚Ä¶just buy all the wine dude.
Remember last year when we were like "Oh yes, wedding category for us!" and then LOL NOPE. Ruthless man.
How is the May scorecard out already? Good lord. Slow down time.
@jessmuir0407 I hope so.
Note to self: Just because the grapes aren't mixed in with the berries on the table, doesn't mean‚Ä¶ 
@evilapprentice Well, enjoy them on my behalf. I will miss them dearly.
Ugh. Time to walk to CVS and spend my last precious dollars on allergy medicine. Can I expense this?
@pineknuts Ugh, bastard berries. Ruining my life. I was trying to be healthy.
@evilapprentice The strawberry thing came out of nowhere and it's miserable. I can't get fruit cups anywhere.
@emmaswanstan Yeah, I need to ask around work to see if anyone has any.
@evilapprentice I hope so. They probably were. I haven't had a reaction to grapes before.
@jessmuir0407 I gave up alcohol for Lent so I haven't had it in over a month.
You guys, if I become allergic to grapes and then wine by association, I'm done with life.
We had fruit at work today, berries and grapes. Being allergic to berries, I grabbed some grapes. I'm now itchy beyond belief.
A great read. I am very, very ready for this show to come back. "The Many Faces of Tatiana Maslany 
I didn't need that Amy Winehouse trailer in my life. I'm having a hard enough week as it is. Ugh. #tears
@evilapprentice @manamitru @jessmuir0407 REALLY?! Holy shit. I thought it was a new show. Throwing away my "up to date on things" card.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @jessmuir0407 How many seasons are there? I have commitment issues.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @jessmuir0407 Like, is it easy to watch? I have the worst attention span of all time.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru @evilapprentice Ohhh, that's a good time then.
@manamitru @evilapprentice @jessmuir0407 There's just a lot of screaming emojis in my dash so it was hard to miss. I don't watch either.
@evilapprentice Ask @manamitru or @Jessmuir0407. I have no clue what they're talking about besides that it's about Arrow.
@evilapprentice Apparently.
@denbac RIGHT?!
@denbac My coworkers are doing a shoot with Sam Hunt today and I know you will understand my pain of not being there.
@ncitypretty Haha, it can be fun, especially if you have friends that send really funny ones.
@ncitypretty Haha, what are you trying to figure out?
Like, if we have hundreds of dollars to throw away, we would just go to Coachella and see who we want.
‚Äú@msxdx: WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF PRESALE AND TICKETS ARE ALREADY ON STUBHUB YOU ALL ARE SICK‚Äù &lt;- what she said
I greatly dislike the @axs waiting room. I'm still here but there's tickets on StubHub already for four times the price. Great.
@msxdx eeeee. fingers crossed!
@msxdx 
@daniellesacco Your treat? Haha
I'm in a terrible mood, so I'm listening to the Spice Girls and N'Sync. I regret nothing.
‚Äú@kellydirck: If I ever text you ‚ÄùOk‚Äú instead of ‚ÄùOkay‚Äú, I‚Äôm furious about whatever I‚Äôm saying it in response to.‚Äù Truth.
@evilapprentice @bbygray #same
@bbygray @evilapprentice Hey man, if you‚Äôre gonna be stressed, this is definitely worth stressing over.
@bbygray Man, your life sucks Gray. I don't know how you deal.
@Jessmuir0407 It‚Äôs too much. I do appreciate the making my face hurt from smiling so big though.
Stop talking about babies. You‚Äôre making me want to go lay in the street. #Castle
@Jessmuir0407 KILLS ME. I‚Äôm like please stop, I‚Äôm not strong enough for this right now. Or ever.
@Jessmuir0407 Just got to it and I'm melting with feels.
This baby episodes still kills me. I‚Äôm sitting on my couch like <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #Castle
See you guys? The neighborhood is safer already. #LastRT
@CarrieCornish I wouldn‚Äôt mind moving, I just need to make more money first. That reminds me, I was going to text you.
Seriously guys, top notch neighborhood over here. #LastRT
@jessmuir0407 Ugh. Dammit.
Oh my god, you guys remember the seashells?! How did I forget about the seashells!? I need to go outside. #Castle
@jessmuir0407 *shrug*
Every April Fool's joke I've seen today has left me indifferent. The internet has made me an empty shell of a human being.
Sometimes people I know do really cool things, like this: Public Displays of Affection | Joggers: 
@castlepromos Just go back to the tweet and click the RT button. It'll un-RT it.
@jessmuir0407 Because it's not a favorite episode so I don't need to actually watch it. I find their voices soothing, lol.
Best parts about working from home? I'm a million times more productive and I get to watch Castle. As an introvert, I thrive from my couch.
@ellamatronic I was attacked when I was in college. I took a lot of defense classes etc. after. It's good, but I never feel 100% safe.
Anyway, back to work. If anyone has any job/apartment/guard dog leads, send them my way.
@bbygray Haha, no worries! Welcome back.
@_michellephi I would very much like to have two big dogs.
Also, the preventative "don't walk around alone" is pretty damn useless when you live alone. Thanks for the advice HOA.
@ellamatronic I have pepper spray but I think I need to invest in something stronger.
@jessmuir0407 I have about $200 to my name right now, so that's not happening.
@jessmuir0407 I work, haha. The only reason I'm home now is because they're coming to fix something.
@jessmuir0407 I think my outdoor runs are back to being a no-go.
@jessmuir0407 All of the above tbh. Well, I have pepper spray. I might need a smaller knife. I just saw the note and was like‚Ä¶oh.
@_michellephi KTown man. This is why I need a big dog, who is cuddly‚Ä¶but also fierce and can defend me.
I'm now taking monetary donations/letters of recommendation for a new job so I can move a couple blocks over from the hood hood.
I just came home to the delightful note that there was an attempted rape and another robbery in front of my building the other night.
@bbygray That damn song always comes on when I'm at the grocery store or something and I have to fight curling up into a ball from feels.
@carriecornish I have so many damn streaming devices connected to my TV now, I have no idea what it could be at this point, haha.
@carriecornish I kind of want it on Sling, but if that thing cuts off during GOT I might actually lose it.
@marshiebcakes I hope your day picks up dearest &lt;3
Now, do I want HBO on my Sling or Apple TV? Which will crash less?
Electrician: "I'll be at your apt at 5:30." 

"I'll be there at 3."

"I'll be there between 3-5."

I have a job. Please make up your mind.
@jessmuir0407 They're filming downtown. I don't go downtown unless I'm volunteering or being bribed with food/alcohol.
@MarshieBCakes Same girl. Same.
@jessmuir0407 If she's gone for longer, my feels are going to have major problems.
@jessmuir0407 Right?! It's nuts.
@jessmuir0407 It looks so intense. I'm not emotionally prepared for this show yet. At all.
@jessmuir0407 I am not breathing.
@jessmuir0407 NO
Tumblr: "CLICK THIS!" 

Me: Hellllll no.
I sometimes get scared that my rational mind won‚Äôt be able to control the emotional and destructive side. Today was just very scary.
And since I spent my week‚Äôs food allowance on BBQ just now, I‚Äôll be staying home for the rest of the week.
I dedicate this banana pudding to @evilapprentice. Come back soon my friend. @ Baby Blues Bar-B-Que 
@evilapprentice I will. It's on my way home...and I'll be safe in my car.
@evilapprentice Only for you. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Attention @evilapprentice: I‚Äôm on my way to Baby Blues BBQ.
Death Cab for Cutie in-store show at @amoebamusic! #LosAngeles #LiveMusic @ Amoeba Music 
@evilapprentice That was the day he was reassured that I wasn't as weird as he had initially thought.
@evilapprentice Oh, he knows of team tent. We had dinner together once and they were filming a couple blocks away.

@carriecornish I forgot where I saw it but I'm watching right now and I'm dying.
Whoever said to watch Mad Men with the idea that Pete Campbell is an alien trying to be human‚Ä¶you are my hero. #MadMen
I‚Äôve realized that my life is greatly lacking in something to look forward to.
@redbullLAX @coachella choose your wings
@carriecornish Sweet. It's not too bad. There's no DVR or anything, but I still like it.
@4x07 Of course! I still haven't heard it because I was too busy having a meltdown.
@carriecornish $20/mo cable streaming. They've added a ton of channels. It's a little glitchy, but works well enough, 
@carriecornish Mmm, I can look. My Sling is on east coast time for AMC so I never have to worry about it.
@carriecornish So good. So, so good.
Real Talk: Selena songs are the most Spanish I know. Well these and the songs mariachis play at funerals and weddings.
@4x07 
@4x07 Yep, I've seen it a lot. Let me grab the link.
Time to listen to Selenas for the rest of the day.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 I'm slowly preparing my body for all the alcohol I'm going to drink on Easter. No regrets.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru No. I did so good on my #hi run yesterday. Also, I'm having pizza tomorrow.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I just want fries right now so‚Ä¶that's where my mind is.
The high schooler in me is loving this new Death Cab for Cutie album. I want to drive to Big Sur and listen to it for hours.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I just want that button in life. Like, "I WANT CHILI CHEESE FRIES! BRING THEM AMAZON!"
@manamitru whatttttt
That episode was so precious that I managed to fight off my migraine and fever with giggling for an hour. Well done @RobHanning.
This show is so dumbbbbb why do I love it so much?! #Castle
I‚Äôm so tired that the second hand embarrassment is non-existent. I‚Äôm just laughing and wanting to sleep. #Castle
This lawyer loses all points for subtlety. #Castle
@browncrayon Maybe one of my beach days‚Ä¶
Why am I the only person who doesn‚Äôt know who Andie is? #Castle
I can‚Äôt stop giggling. I didn‚Äôt even know I giggled tbh. #Castle
@bbygray Same. I just realized I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and it went to commercial and I was like‚Ä¶wait what?
I‚Äôve missed Laine. I didn‚Äôt know I did until just now. #Castle
I‚Äôve already lol‚Äôed twice. Well played, @RobHanning. Well played. #Castle
Oh thank god, I managed to stay awake. Hurry up, DWTS. I only have so much energy left for #Castle.
@browncrayon I still need to listen to it! Or maybe I don‚Äôt..
@Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôm tempted to nap, but I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt wake up
@Jessmuir0407 it's not on this week because all my shows can't be on at once and make my life fun.
You guys. I‚Äôm falling asleep. Keep me awake for #Castle.
I legit just sitting here eating an avocado because I can‚Äôt think of any other way to distract myself for an hour and a half.
@evilapprentice HEYYYYY ARE YOU DRUNK?!
So, good episode? #Castle
@evilapprentice @DaraCreasey I did not say #hi. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to but because I forgot my water bottle and almost died.
I decided to give my favorite outdoor run one last go before I start Crossfit tomorrow and end up in‚Ä¶ 
@evilapprentice #hihihi!
TODAY WAS A HORRIBLE DAY TO FORGET WATER. #dying
Hey @evilapprentice, no tents. Just #hi. 
#hi Scandal! (PS: I forgot water. Totes gonna die.)
Tweeps, what‚Äôs filming on Van Ness?
Alright. Time to run and say #hi. But mostly run because I literally sat and watched TV all day yesterday.
Whatever is filming off Arlington‚Ä¶you‚Äôre ruining my Castle watching schedule.
The doll with the screwdriver in it's head is in one of the office bathrooms and everyone is blaming me. I wish I was that brilliant tbh.
@evilapprentice I'm majorly hyper right now, so I can probably say #hi.
@evilapprentice Isn't it your #BFF's episode tonight?
@evilapprentice But #Castle.
@evilapprentice I mean, that's like a 12 minute mile which is totally do-able but I'm just really tired today.
@jessmuir0407 Red Bull? lol
@evilapprentice I was planning on saying #hi, but I don't know if I'll have time. May have to shorten the run today.
@jessmuir0407 I was in training for five hours. I needed something to make me human again.
So. If I drink this whole coffee, will that give me enough energy to do my run and get home in time to watch #Castle?
Oh my gosh. Getting surprise presents at work is kind of the best thing ever. 10/10 would recommend. @aprilbegins, you are adorable human &lt;3
Ugh, I'm going to have to get TIDAL now aren't I?
@marshiebcakes lollllll this tweet is like‚Ä¶straight from my mind
@msxdx I saw! I tried to get tickets when they went on sale but‚Ä¶nope
@msxdx Whattttt. For what?!

@pineknuts Good lord, what are you allergic to?
@evilapprentice @loteriagrill Sunday. All the margaritas for me.
‚Äú@TommyLasorda: The only Angels in Los Angeles are in Heaven, and they're looking down on the Dodgers.‚Äù I've missed baseball shade.
My solution is to listen to oldies all day so it's not as obvious how horrible these headphones are. #silverlining
Life Update: IT found me some blackberry headphones from the early 2000's. They sound like I'm underwater but it's something.
I left my headphones at home. I would literally rather cut off my own head than be at work with no headphones.
@elmerspears Of course, of course. Lots of prayers and good thoughts coming their way.
@Jessmuir0407 We don't have a football team. This is all we have.
"Why are you late?" "Because during this Holy Week we were blessed with a morning police chase and I respect the universe enough to watch."
It takes a special kind of idiot to head towards the 405 on a Monday morning as you're running away from police.
CAR CHASE!
@Jessmuir0407 If we do, I hope it's cute. Haha
I woke up and thought it was Sunday. That hurt.
But seriously, I‚Äôm half traumatized and half trying to decide how to start a cult so I can be rich.
I made terrible television choices today. Time to look at kitten GIFs.
The one relief I have from the documentary is to know I can never accidentally become a Scientologist because I have no money. #GoingClear
I also think I know people who are secret Scientologists. #GoingClear
All I‚Äôm learning from this documentary is that if you‚Äôre mentally ill and white, you can make LOTS of money. #GoingClear
This Xenu segment...am I high right now? #GoingClear
@Jessmuir0407 Haha, maybe during summer.
@Jessmuir0407 I have too many shows to catch up on to go back and watch that, haha.
@Jessmuir0407 2
@Jessmuir0407 I spent all night watching it, haha.
Can this helicopter stop circling? I‚Äôm trying to learn about the crazy people.
@evilapprentice It‚Äôs solid money.
@evilapprentice At least you‚Äôre not a hooker? Oh wait, I‚Äôm an author now. Thanks Jane the Virgin.
@evilapprentice #RIP
@evilapprentice I would also like you to dedicate a section to Boomie.
@evilapprentice Good point. I could probably take this on. I like giving advice that no one will listen to.
@evilapprentice I would write it but I‚Äôm not good at toning down the sass.
@jessiekaiser Oh fuck, THATS what I was going to watch this weekend. Oops. That‚Äôll be my after work binge watch this week.
@evilapprentice That really is the ultimate question.
@evilapprentice .shudder. I‚Äôm good thanks.
@evilapprentice Only #hi whilst still moving buddy. No sitting to say #hi. Definitely no camping.
I hope this documentary doesn‚Äôt compel me like Married At First Sight did.
@evilapprentice It‚Äôs too late. All this fucked up sleep is going to mess up my energy to say #hi tomorrow.
@evilapprentice I‚Äôm starting that next after my 12 episodes of The X-Files. I‚Äôm gonna have some FUCKED dreams tonight.
@betro LOL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@DawnHiggi @betro @MSPT2000 Aliens know no age Dawn.
@Jessmuir0407 Just give in man. It's a great song. Haha
@melodyeliza_ I couldn't help it. It's been in my head for days. I make everyone listen to it so they can suffer as well. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 click it click it click it
@betro That episode is the sole reason why this emoji was created: <SMIRKING FACE>
#LastRT was said sausage song that‚Äôs probably going to start our next fight.
@betro I‚Äôm watching Ice and I forgot who was infected and I was legit pacing around my apartment.
‚ÄúI finally got that sausage song out f my head.‚Äù *waits an hour* *plays sausage song* ‚ÄúFuck. You.‚Äù
The boy just tried to give me shit for not watching The X-Files when it was on. I then kindly reminded him that I was in Kindergarten.
Post-birthday party perks: breakfast tacos with left over chorizo. #awyes
I have zero things planned today. X-Files? X-Files.
Relationship Status: still watching #MarriedAtFirstSight in my underwear. Winner.
@RJalias Shockingly, no.
I‚Äôm watching Married at First Sight and I‚Äôm starting to think its a good idea. Send help.
‚ÄúMaybe you should be on Married at First Sight. Oh never mind there‚Äôs a psych eval. That would knock you out.‚Äù #wow #buttrue
Awww, Notre Dame lost?
I am so tired. I could totally use a drink but alas, I cannot. One week dammit. One more week.

@Jessmuir0407 All the reasons.
Why is Cops and Robbers seriously one of the best episodes though? #Castle
An example of the blinding pain I‚Äôve been dealing with all night: I finally just realized my pajama shirt was on inside out and backwards.
@DawnHiggi @betro @MSPT2000 Squeeze messed me up so bad.
@evilapprentice <HUSHED FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
Singing Lisa Sawyer on my bathroom floor, hoping this excruciating pain will knock me out. This is the perfect periscope premiere tbh.
@evilapprentice No, don't do that. That's too much of a risk.
@evilapprentice I‚Äôve realized in my long relationship with tinder that I have no type so this could probably work.
@evilapprentice Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen.
@evilapprentice I really need to start my blog back up. This shit writes itself.
@evilapprentice Ugh, lies. This is is not the biz. Also, the fan/light when out in my bathroom so this is all happening in the dark LOL LIFE
@evilapprentice It‚Äôs been like this since I was a teenager. If I don‚Äôt drug myself up fast enough, this happens. Doctor said its normal. <UNAMUSED FACE>
Remember how we get punished monthly for NOT getting knocked up and I end up puking and sleeping on my bathroom floor? #sofun #allthefun
@evilapprentice No! No #teamtent! #teamcashmoney
@Abigail_Hope_ #Nope
@evilapprentice Also, money. And work I can actually do well and enjoy.
@evilapprentice Oh, I will be hit by a car. I‚Äôm fighting for a job at Paramount bc it‚Äôs 2 mi away and the odds of living are in my favor.
@evilapprentice I looked at my credit card and it‚Äôs all food. All of it. Except for my bike which I need for when my car dies.
@evilapprentice Oh dude, I gave up after one. You're far more advanced than me. I was gonna go for two and then remembered I like food.
@evilapprentice Perfecto. It‚Äôs a delightful feeling ain‚Äôt it?
@evilapprentice I‚Äôm looking around my apt for things I can sell since I have a degree &amp; therefore no valuable skills besides acquiring debt.
After evaluating my finances, I've decided I need to sell my car, begin sex work or freelance. Medical costs are not cheap my friends.
Seriously, I love Vin so much it brings tears to my eyes. #Dodgers
VIN SCULLY‚ÄôS VOICE. MY SWEET PRECIOUS BROADCASTING ANGEL. IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH. Let me love you @Dodgers!
@manamitru He‚Äôs trying to earn his street cred! They grow up so fast <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@slinganswers The app constantly resets itself or I get a playback error. Yesterday, I got an error on three different channels.
@evilapprentice Triple shot margaritas (that you can add beer to), A+ music selections and gay psychics 
@evilapprentice Fiesta Cantina. Gay bar in West Hollywood (WeHo). Not fancy by any means. Dirty, kinda smells like piss BUT‚Ä¶
@evilapprentice I also met a gay psychic there once and had drank enough of my margarita that was like YES TELL ME MORE.
@evilapprentice Perfection. That sounds like a great day. I am partial to Fiesta Cantina's margaritas though. Size of my head and delicious.
@evilapprentice Did you go to Hollywood or downtown? Or Santa Monica. Ugh, they're all good. Margaritas are just good.
@evilapprentice This was my test to myself. I don't need it by any means but my life is substantially more boring. Also, LOTERIA IS THE BEST
@evilapprentice I was hoping I would have some great epiphany that I didn't really enjoy drinking but nope, I do.
@evilapprentice Right, but it's not like at 12:01 on Easter Sunday I'm not going to drink any and everything. Or like, one margarita.
I haven't had a drop of alcohol in over a month. My co-workers looked at me like I had just cured some terrible disease.
BEAUTY PRODUCT PEOPLE: I'm in a need of a good/better dry shampoo. Thoughts? Suggestions?
I got a raspberry cookie from Subway. This is the day I learn if I'm‚Ä¶

2) If Subway even uses real berries
@betro So many feels. All the feels. I started re-watching the series this week and it's just too much.
@betro Oh come ON
I just realized that it's Friday and now everything I wanted to lunch on is not possible.
I'm great.
@jessmuir0407 I'll miss you buddy.
@evilapprentice I had to overdraft my account to put gas in my car so I could drive to my aunt's house so I could eat. Adulthood is TERRIBLE
@ajohns366 Even better when you find something you forgot you had and gain the satisfaction of having "new" clothes.
@evilapprentice I can't get BBQ until I get paid. Life struggles.
I just don't care this much. 

Also, I still want BBQ.
@jessmuir0407 @missy520 @daisycakes4 @manamitru Yes.
@missy520 @daisycakes4 @jessmuir0407 @manamitru *note to self* don't tweet before going into a meeting
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru To be fair, the background was 100% terrible but I usually cry, so it's not that noticeable.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Being negative gets them more attention‚Ä¶
@jessmuir0407 Since it gets them clicks and engagements to their site‚Ä¶yes.
Can we talk about how I‚Äôm in tears? I didn‚Äôt know I cared this much tbh. #Scandal
THE RING #Scandal
@RJalias I did not. I remembered I'm too poor to order BBQ and too lazy to go get it, haha.
@RJalias I want BBQ SO BADLY. It's all I can think about. Haha
I‚Äôm so tempted to get this BBQ delivered because this craving is real.
Honestly, @Sling. What the hell am I paying you for if there‚Äôs an error every time I try to watch something?
@evilapprentice @DaraCreasey Deal.
@evilapprentice @DaraCreasey I like to say #hi whilst still moving, remember? But ugh, BBQ.
@evilapprentice I wish you were in LA because I want Baby Blues SO bad and there‚Äôs NO ONE TO GO WITH
@evilapprentice Well played Alan Cumming, well played.
@katrak The little one looks completely done with the whole situation.
Beyonce was at Soul Cycle this morning because of course she was.
@evilapprentice @manamitru ahahahaha
@manamitru @evilapprentice All the emojisssss
@evilapprentice <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è I feel we probs share this face IRL <UNAMUSED FACE>
@evilapprentice @manamitru I'm so glad you discovered different eyes. The emojis really tell a story that way.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Actually, I'm not. That's a lie.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Haha, I'm sorry.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru And acknowledging them makes them louder.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I think people give these dozen or so people in the grand scheme of residents of the earth way too much credit.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I don't even bother to engage. It's a waste of time and energy.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Yeah man, don't include me in that bullshit. No thank you. Do not want.
@jessmuir0407 What?
@anne_litt YES! I saw him on Tuesday night and he was wonderful. That song has been in my head ever since.
I have never wanted a diverse, young morning radio show to listen to more than I did this morning. The universe is testing me.
Getting a power green smoothie, talking about Coachella, as us hipster people do.
@evilapprentice EW.
@evilapprentice ~*magic*~
@manamitru @evilapprentice <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@Grumpy_Banana I mostly just feel very weak and tired.
@Grumpy_Banana I felt better once I was home. I was able to muster up some energy to shower and now trying to figure out SOMETHING to eat.
@Grumpy_Banana Almost passed out in my car on the way home. Collapsed in my apartment. All good times.
@bbygray Latergramme is free up to a certain amount of posts. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve used at work.
@evilapprentice That is some damning evidence.
@evilapprentice oh shit.
@evilapprentice Well, that sounds intense.
@evilapprentice but I want to say #hi to all
@Msshr3d thanks boo xox
@agriffin7017 Thanks bb &lt;3 I was driving super slow. Half of LA probably wanted to kill me.
@Jessmuir0407 Possibly.
@evilapprentice .shudder.
@evilapprentice Probs. I think running to say #hi is out today.
@MarshieBCakes I hope so. I‚Äôve felt weird the last couple of days and today got worse. I think my iron is getting too low again.
Now I have an ice pack, iPad and X-Files until I‚Äôm forcefully taken to urgent care.
Felt weird all day. Started to get disoriented on the drive home. Collapsed the second I walked in the door.
‚Äú@Dodgers Join us for our first Yoga Day! Ticket package includes mat &amp; postgame yoga on the field" This is so LA and I don't care. I want.
@fembot_nicole Try a felt tip liner! The brush is a little easier to control.
I waited too long to go play guitar at lunch and now I don't have time. These are my struggles.
@vodkalemonades OMG YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE TOO!?
@_michellephi you do you my friend
@emmaswanstan yeah man
Dude, I went to a meeting for 10 minutes and came back to my timeline in shambles.
2nd Reaction: Article is so ignorant I can't ‚Ä¶
@jessmuir0407 
That Deadline article though‚Ä¶.#wut
There's a giant Orphan Black billboard on La Brea and I almost crashed my car when I saw it last night.
@bloodlesscoup I'm still convinced I'm going to be fired at every turn.
@bloodlesscoup It's so weird. Considering I barely made it through the first six months, it's a damn miracle.
It is my two-year anniversary at work. Who let that happen?
Leon Bridges at The Troubadour 3.24.15 @ Troubadour 
@evilapprentice My brain is running too fast for my words.
@evilapprentice Oh! No. I'm at The Troubadour for a concert and needed a wristband. I had coffee before this. Had confusion.
@evilapprentice it had to be done. I went to bed at this time yesterday.
Two iced coffees and when the guard asked me to put out my right arm for a wristband, I was confused for about 35 seconds.
@evilapprentice Ugh, lucky.
@evilapprentice Bff is on hiatus?
@evilapprentice Haha, not forever. Just for a little bit. A hiatus, if you will.
This whole ‚Äúfleeing the state‚Äù thing is becoming more viable. I like it.
@vodkalemonades wtf is that!?
I've been radio silent all morning because I really need to actually do my job today but I AM MISSING SO MANY THINGS. #XFilesIsBack
@manamitru #StopAllManipsBecauseTheyCreepMeTheFuckOut2k15
@katrak Yeah, my computer is old as hell but it does it well enough. It‚Äôs only bothersome when I love the episode and it gets glitchy.
@Jessmuir0407 I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see her in another job, so I‚Äôm not even bothering getting worked up about it.
@Jessmuir0407 You do if it‚Äôs on your way to something you don‚Äôt hate.
I want to know who installed card payment in our laundry room. I want to hug them and cry in their arms.
@Jessmuir0407 So?
@Jessmuir0407 Politics. Duh.
@katrak Sorry. I chose sleep over waiting until 10pm today.
Toast is a substantial dinner, right?
Chris the farmer doesn‚Äôt get the counting. Chris the farmer doesn‚Äôt get most things I don‚Äôt think. #DWTS
@Jessmuir0407 I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to have that problem,
That episode was fine. This season is fine. I'm fine. I have breakfast for dinner. Everything is fine.
@Jessmuir0407 .rolls eyes.
@Jessmuir0407 WE KNOW
#CalledIt #Castle
I always thought it something happened to me and they went through my purse they would probably think robbery from lack of money. #Castle
Oh, that‚Äôs actually a fairly interesting twist. #Castle
@jimadler And mine.
When the suspected murdered looks like one of your ex-boyfriends‚Ä¶ #seemslegit #Castle
@evilapprentice #hi?
@Jessmuir0407 Oh 100%
This guy doesn‚Äôt seem that sad about that woman dying tbh #Castle
But seriously, someone get me that coat.  I lust over leather accents. #Castle
@evilapprentice #Bye Beckett.
Hi Beckett. #Castle
That event space is the same place Castle and Beckett wanted to have their wedding. Well, one of the places.
@RJalias I‚Äôm trying. Haha
@manamitru I‚Äôm always a little confused about how a show about murder fairly consistently makes me smile.
@Jessmuir0407 That‚Äôs why I said ish, haha.
I was a little bored but then there was murder so, I‚Äôm on board now. Ish. #Castle
@Jessmuir0407 Screw food. That coat was perfect.
This is my weekly I NEED BECKETT‚ÄôS COAT tweet, except this time I mean it 100x more. #Castle
@RJalias Who says I have time? Haha
@Grumpy_Banana That was AMAZING.
@RJalias Haha, I finished Empire at work today. I could make Castle Tuesday happen.
@RJalias It's SO late. And I've just got my sleep schedule back on track and have to be up late tomorrow now sooo...
@evilapprentice Meh, alright. Let's hope my TV cooperates.
@Jessmuir0407 I'm 50/50.
Do I watch Castle now or later? And by later I probably mean tomorrow because sleepy times are here again.
@jacobjunior7 Oh god, that beard was so terrifying I couldn't even look at it.
I don't know how I'm going to stay up late on a work night tomorrow night, but it'll be worth it to see this guy: 
@jessmuir0407 Sounds boring tbh
I finished Empire. Other show recommendations?

Happy 5th birthday to my sweet Abigail. You are joy, laughter and love all rolled up into one little‚Ä¶ 
But like, what if Ted Cruz just got a little too into #SundayFunday and that was just a drunk tweet?
@betro Seriously! Next spring! All the moms I met were super excited about it.
@betro I bummed we didn‚Äôt make it over there! I wanted to check out the Farmer‚Äôs Market, but my knee said NOPE.
@betro @CicLAvia isn‚Äôt it the best?!
What a day with these delightful humans. #CicLAvia is a lot better when you're with friends...and‚Ä¶ 
@Jessmuir0407 Has there been a new Orphan Black trailer posted recently?
Bernadette the bike and I, out for a stroll. #CicLAvia @ Metro-Universal City 
. @CicLAvia was a blast. I didn‚Äôt crash my bike, but I‚Äôm also not going to make it to @LAOpera in time. Damn.
I can't believe Miss Abigail is tuning five tomorrow. Watch out world, this little one is comin' for ya. 
We haven't moved for hours. I would say send help, but don't. I refuse to stop. #Empire #Cookie4Eva 
Oh sure, let them all hook up and give me false hope and he‚Äôs still gonna marry a bitch. That‚Äôs fine. #Empire
I would love to rest for @CicLAvia tomorrow but I can‚Äôt turn off Empire and who needs sleep ever anyway.
@evilapprentice I was watching S3 the other day and it was so bittersweet.
@kellydirck Good. Great.
I‚Äôm never going to get this Drip Drop song out of my head, am I? #Empire
@McAllisterKXLU I love that song, I don't even care.
But why is Cookie my spirit animal? #Empire
@evilapprentice #notent #justhi
Bike picked up. Got some @RockCampLA postcards handed out. Empire binge watch has commenced. Saturday is a good day.
When you decide to leave your neighborhood and up your ice cream game... @ Carmela Ice Cream 
@evilapprentice I think you might be upgrading from tent to RV dude‚Ä¶

Only ONE (!!) is still perfect.
@Grumpy_Banana I can't
And what in the hell is going on with Lea Michele‚Äôs eyebrows?
Wait. We‚Äôre doing Pushing Daises v. Firefly? Why? Why would you make me make this decision?
@Jessmuir0407 I just put it on. I haven‚Äôt seen an episode since the special after Cory died.
These are my my life priorities, as depicted through the amount of t-shirts I possess. From left to‚Ä¶ 
I feel somewhat obligated to watch the Glee finale since I was an extra twice and did love it for like, a minute.
@evilapprentice Then you fake receive a message on your phone, say "oh, my friend is waiting for me *somewhere else* and walk away briskly.
@evilapprentice Step 1: Go places alone. Step 2: Identify generally friendly humans. Step 3: Say #hi Step 4: Free things/friendship
@evilapprentice Sympathy #hi works. I've gotten a lot of free alcohol from sympathy #hi.
@evilapprentice I enjoy saying #hi to the opera people. They enjoy saying #hi to me because I'm always by myself and they feel bad.
@evilapprentice Hopefully. I have to get from CicLAvia to my apt to the opera in two hours. A tent would make things easier tbh.
@evilapprentice No tent required. Whew.
@evilapprentice Ugh, finally got through. The guy was mildly rude, but I have my ticket so at least there's that.
@erinscafe But like‚Ä¶what are you supposed to do when you don't want to talk to other humans?
@evilapprentice You're telling me. I just want to know if I have a ticket for Sunday. That's all.
I love that @LAOpera has a call back feature, but not that I can't call back their call back. #somanymissedcalls

PUNK AS FUCK

WHO DID IT 
Suge Knight is basically doing that thing like when you tell a toddler "Okay, time to go!" &amp; then they throw themselves limply on the floor.
@vodkalemonades YESSSS GIRL
@grumpy_banana I JUST bought a floral dress to wear with my boots. I've been waiting for this my whole life.
@evilapprentice Ew. #Hi Friday.
When someone isn‚Äôt listening to you talk so you say you‚Äôre wrangling dinosaurs this weekend‚Ä¶
@evilapprentice There was cray?
@aqualice Haha, Lena Dunham from Girls. She's in this week's episode.
@aqualice I liked it. I don't like Lena so that storyline was bothersome, but for the most part, I feel like they're getting back on track.
@jessmuir0407 Yeah, I couldn't deal with her. I'm glad she was pretty scarce during the episode. This felt more like old Scandal to me.
@grande_lattte Streams stuff‚Ä¶yeah, that's about it.
@jessmuir0407 It was a solid episode. I really liked it. Lena Dunham 100% got on my nerves, so I'm glad she‚Ä¶won't be coming back. Haha
#ScandalHangover
Look neighbors‚Ä¶congrats on the sex and everything but please shut up so I can sleep.
A rough day, but so happy I was able to pull it together and celebrate my friends and all the amazing things in their lives. Now, I sleep.
@JGarza621 #RIP
@Jessmuir0407 Same tbh
COIN FLIP BRACKET UPDATE (9 PST): Busted. Womp womp.
JFC THAT WAS SCARY #MarchMadness
Are you kidding me NC? #MarchMadness
@stacyraeg WAIT REALLY!? There's two Rita's by my office and I always think of you, haha.
I don't think I want to go for my run today.
COIN FLIP BRACKET UPDATE (2:25PST): This thing is all fucked up now. #MarchMadness
Ugh. #MarchMadness
Baylor, get your shit together. #MarchMadness
@penguinoftroy I miss Trogdor.
@monicatamla ME! Well, the coin.
COIN BRACKET UPDATE (11:45PST): We are undefeated. I have no idea how. #MarchMadness
That last tweet was for work. I would appreciate if you all took 5 minutes of time you're going to waste online anyway to play our game.
I just scored 5950 points as the Red Ranger. Let's join forces and beat the evil Sledge and his Vivix. Play now!  
Whew. #NDvNE
I know I flipped a coin for my bracket, but I would like for Notre Dame to not lose right now. #MarchMadness
@castle_examiner Haha, excellent gif usage.
@monicatamla Yessssss. *filled out bracket, has no clue what is happening but picked UAB*
@joanacteixeira It's not a legitimate excuse at all. BUT, I do think that Shonda has way more pull with the network than others.
I just filled out my first bracket ever by flipping a coin because I have absolutely no fucking clue what I'm doing. #MarchMadness
Only two weeks left to enroll for #RCGLA2015! Give the gift of the best week ever. #RTforHighFives 
Hey Internet, what‚Äôs filming on Lucerne in LA?
‚Äú@msxdx: DONT LOOK AT ME DONT TOUCH ME. How dare you talk about that #SoundOfMusicABC‚Äù I DONT WANT TO HEAR JULIE SAD HDU ABC
Let‚Äôs pretend the Carrie Underwood thing didn‚Äôt happen okay? #SoundOfMusicABC
Captain Von Trapp could get it. I don‚Äôt even care. #SoundOfMusicABC
I am a puddle of feels on the floor. #SoundOfMusicABC
Where are we at for making sure Julie Andrews lives forever? #SOM50th
Is anyone else watching The Sound of Music special and sobbing?

Right, okay. Good. Me either. <NEUTRAL FACE>
@CarrieCornish <PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART>
@evilapprentice But I don't want to because they scare me
@RJalias it's about 95% PMS haha
@Jessmuir0407 ok thank you
@evilapprentice #hiawkward
@CarrieCornish me too :(
@evilapprentice It was quite delicious. Wearing pants was not.
You win @evilapprentice 
@Jessmuir0407 I was crying over the stick person, I‚Äôve had a long day leave me alone lol
@RJalias Yep. I managed to kind of keep it together for the handshake and lost it at the stick person story because <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Jessmuir0407 I legit don't know what to do right now. Haha
@evilapprentice Yeah, but I would have to put pants back on.
@Jessmuir0407 5x03. I have no other reason besides hormones tbh.
@evilapprentice That‚Äôs a lot of effort tbh.
@Jessmuir0407 No, thank god. I would be much worse. Haha
@evilapprentice Thank goodness I‚Äôm too lazy to prepare an actual meal. I do want to go across the street and get a large ice cream cone tho
@evilapprentice #bye emotional stability
@RJalias 5x03. It doesn‚Äôt even make any sense.
I just started bawling uncontrollably over a Castle episode I've seen at least a dozen times. PMS is stupid.
That thing when your finally order a new bike only to realize said bike cannot fit in your car and you have no bike rack. Dammit.
@mandapandalovee Because it keeps people away from me, lol
@evilapprentice @daracreasey #RIP
@jessmuir0407 I didn't put the screwdriver in it's head, if that makes anything better.
@evilapprentice @daracreasey Good. Got it. I would like to say #hi to the boombox.
@evilapprentice @daracreasey I thought I wasn't supposed to say hi? The doll, though vaguely terrifying is a great companion for boomboxes.
@evilapprentice The screwdriver is a new addition. This doll, in addition to my Annabelle doll guarantees I'll be left alone @ work.
@kellydirck A dude at work once had the nerve to complain about a $40 haircut and the girls dragged his ass. It was incredible.
I was not kidding about the doll. #professionalism 
Today, my boss told me that I am very professional during my yearly review.

I have a doll with a screwdriver in it's head at my desk.
I've been reminded multiple times to do my job today. I was annoyed until I remembered that I'm not eating lunch because I'm over it. #fair
@carriecornish That almost just made me cry.
This morning, I literally woke up on the wrong side of the bed. And I have the migraine to beat all migraines. Oh life.
@CarrieCornish Oh my gosh, I just love her so much.
@CarrieCornish It was horrible. I took Melrose because it‚Äôs usually fast. Incorrect.
Sir, you ran the red light. Yelling at me to watch where I‚Äôm going and wait my turn seems a little out of your understanding.
I‚Äôm stuck behind a Starline bus on Melrose. Send help.
@analgesicsleep That's so cool though! We haven't been able to trace our maternal side that far back. My Grandma took it all to the grave.
@analgesicsleep My maternal great grandma was Mexican Irish too!!
@alwayscastle47 You've got three more days.
@jessmuir0407 I thought you hated Dancing With The Stars?
Another St. Patrick's Day PSA: Don't drink and drive. If you have enough money to go out and get plastered, you have enough money for a ride
I've been waiting more than two months for my W2 to be fixed. I'm almost positive this is illegal and I'm contemplating a strike.
@browncrayon Also, the fact that we haven't had some kind of fundraiser where we do lip sync battles is kind of baffling to me.
@browncrayon Yo, Anna Kendrick alert 
‚Äú@Starbucks: It's worth a little discomfort. Here's the what and the why of #RaceTogether. 
@kellydirck God, that song was my JAM. Still is tbh.
‚Äú@LAist: Map: The Worst Intersections For Pedestrians 
I'm glad brands are making poor marketing choices today because now I can legitimately say I'm working through research.
@betro I feel like that's the general reaction to anything Americans do, haha.
A friendly St. Patrick's Day reminder to NOT TOUCH PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. "They aren't wearing green" is an idiotic excuse.
I would like to thank my years of beer pong tournaments for the ability to throw trash in the wastepaper basket on the other side of the pod
@evilapprentice @daracreasey The key to coping with both is no eye contact and keep running tbh
@evilapprentice @daracreasey There are people with guns man. People in tents &gt; people with guns.
@evilapprentice @daracreasey But‚Ä¶I have to run and say #hi because if I run the other direction there's too many gangs. Also mean and nasty.
@evilapprentice #hihi must say #hi this week‚Ä¶when LA decides it's actually spring and not summer.
@cithrins Hmm, probably the Dunkin. I liked the texture better.
@cithrins It's good! Very sugary. Haha.
@evilapprentice :|
@cithrins girl where have you been? It opened in like‚Ä¶September. People were waiting two hours for donuts. It was insane.
@carriecornish It was good. I'm about to have a major sugar rush.
@cithrins The Santa Monica one is pretty close to our office. The donut is pretty good!
@evilapprentice I get REALLY weird when I drink coffee. I've been banned from drinking it at work unless it's an emergency.
@pineknuts I don't even know if that was an option. I got distracted by the shamrock sprinkles.
@evilapprentice They brought the coffee to the office too, but I can't have it if I want to be a normal human the rest of the day.
@evilapprentice That's nothing. When it first opened (there is one in all of LA) people were waiting 2+ hours. I did not care enough.
@evilapprentice It's quite delicious. Would I wait the 30 minutes to get another? No, but it's good. Haha
It finally happened. I‚Äôve been given my very first Dunkin Donut‚Ä¶to go along with my green smoothie. Oops. 
@carriecornish Me too! I was putting mascara on at the time and it got all fucked up because I ran. Haha
@daracreasey I take the same drive every morning. I must say, watching the sun come up in the mirror? Not a bad way to wake up.
@WholeFoods Indeed it was. I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs really a morning person. Can‚Äôt blame him.
.annalisemm and I act out when jgarza621 leaves us for too long.  #thebox 
Look @WholeFoods guy, I get that the sun is barely up, but you could at least try to act like you don‚Äôt hate everything in the world.
Exactly 1 year ago today! SHAMROCK SHAKE! via @timehop 
Not gonna make it to #Castle tonight. I‚Äôve been fighting sleep since 830.
@Jessmuir0407 God, it makes me laugh every time haha
@meannejeanne Each time I heard it this weekend, it was from a yt and it just made me cringe.
I get so much second-hand embarrassment when people say ‚Äúyasssss‚Äù in places that aren‚Äôt the Internet.
Chris is dancing to Footloose and all I can think of is‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúOf course they give the girl with the biggest boobs the most ill fitting top and make her dance the jive.‚Äù-J Watches #DWTS
@cithrins <CONFUSED FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
@cithrins That‚Äôs been the disclaimer even before the season started though. Their contracts are up so if they decide no more, no more.
@cithrins I will melt into a little puddle and cry.
I honestly lost track of which person we thought killed Henry about 20 minutes ago. #Castle
@bbygray oh fuck, is that how it works? Guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm allergic to strawberries now.
@Jessmuir0407 She also won‚Äôt give me quarters for laundry. She kinda sucks tbh.
Mimi reminds me of the lady that runs the liquor store across the street &amp; shoots mean looks when I buy multiple bottles of wine. #Castle
Finally Beckett. JFC. #Castle
@kellydirck Yep. Solid advice.
@manamitru I‚Äôm checking Snapchat.
How did I miss the puppies?
@TerriEdda I mean, why wouldn‚Äôt you ask that?
I‚Äôm highly confused by my feelings right now.
@evilapprentice Same.
@evilapprentice I was very confused by that comment.
@CarrieCornish It makes me stupidly happy.
@Grumpy_Banana I lol‚Äôed‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs true.
Well damn girl. Get it. #Castle
Bless Ryan for continually greeting Castle and Beckett as ‚ÄúCastles‚Äù #Castle
@Castle_Examiner Good point. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a show end when I wasn‚Äôt already over it. This could hurt. Haha.
@RJalias I just like that my after work activities are either good workout or eating cheese in my dark apartment. Haha
@Castle_Examiner I've been in the mindset that I'll take any outcome well, but this tweet still made me a little sad.
Too hot to run. I have chosen to instead eat some of the $20 worth of cheese and kale I just bought at Trader Joe‚Äôs.
@castle41319 One of my friends (who doesn't watch the show) was like "Who the hell is she comparing herself to? She's gorgeous." lol
@daniellesacco I'm still emotionally unstable from all the tears yesterday. These sweet humans‚Ä¶I just can't deal. That panel was perfect.
@daniellesacco Stopppppp.
@ciclavia @laopera Yes, that is a solid plan. in the meantime, can everyone just sing on their bikes?
I don't know how I'm going to do both @CicLAvia and @LAOpera in one day‚Ä¶but it's gonna happen. #pleasedontbehotoutside
@mangosplz Basically everything she said at the Paley panel had me in tears. And I was there by myself which made it even more odd.
"7 Times Gina Rodriguez Made Us Want To Take On The World 
@jessmuir0407 I keep forgetting there's a new episode tonight. It's a nice surprise when I remember, haha.
@_ninnymuggins_ So sexy, haha.
Monday morning meetings really messing up my Kendrick listening party‚Ä¶
@daniellesacco Hahaha, I clearly should have just opened Spotify since that's all anyone is listening to in my feed.
@daniellesacco WUT. Listening immediately.
@daniellesacco Guhhh. Do you have it already!? This is what I get for going to bed at a normal time, haha.
Clearly, I should have caught up on The Jinx this weekend. Oops.
@jessmuir0407 That would make more sense. Probably.
@jessmuir0407 Beckett is kidnapped again. We're going to a record.
@msxdx Oh I know it, I know it way too well. Haha.
I heard both "The Safety Dance" and "Wake Me Up Before You Go Go" on the radio this morning, so Monday is pretty okay so far.
@msxdx You're telling me‚Ä¶

@evilapprentice This bunch &gt; Scandal bunch for sure haha
Audience Q&amp;A‚Ä¶lord give me strength
I‚Äôve already cried multiple times during this panel. This cast is full of beautiful souls. #JaneTheVirgin #PaleyFest
The moderator has now learned how to pronounce Rogelio. We‚Äôre getting back on track. #PaleyFest
I can't deal with how adorable and eloquent @hereisgina is. #PaleyFest @ Dolby Theatre 
The moderator can‚Äôt say Rogelio‚Äôs name. This is going to be a long panel you guys. #PaleyFest
@DanielleSacco omggggg
The diversity in this audience honestly makes me a little teary eyed. Making lots of a new friends. #holamigente #PaleyFest
My entire row is empty and dude decides to sit right next to me. <UNAMUSED FACE> #canilive
Popcorn at the Dolby is $7. And they don‚Äôt validate parking. This isn‚Äôt the Oscars anymore buddies, we‚Äôre broke. #PaleyFest
Okay, but why is @HereIsGina one of the most precious human beings of all time? #PaleyFest
Sunday at #PaleyFest parte dos for cwjanethevirgin! @ Dolby Theatre 
Totally creeping on @DanielleSacco at #PaleyFest <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
I‚Äôm so excited for the @CWJaneTheVirgin panel at #PaleyFest tonight! I am NOT excited about having to go outside. #weatherwhyyyy
I‚Äôm trying to navigate @msxdx around the LA Marathon. The universe is working against us. #humanGPS
@evilapprentice Do not say #hi. Do not make eye contact. Do not collect $200.
Also, that is the fastest any human has ever gotten from Dodger Stadium to Santa Monica. #LAMarathon
And now they‚Äôre running with their flags. Aren‚Äôt you tired?!? #LAMarathon
God, these women don‚Äôt even look tired. I look more winded taking my laundry up and down the stairs. #LAMarathon
The only time I‚Äôve ever run down Ocean Ave is when I leave my car abandoned on the side of the road because eff West LA traffic #LAMarathon
@hellofoggy Yeah, probably a nude or light pink would go well. Don‚Äôt want to detract from the red shoes <WINKING FACE>

@grande_lattte the fuck?
I can tell my Uber driver wants me to stop singing along to Blank Space and that‚Äôs just making me sing louder.
@Jessmuir0407 I hope to one day marry someone I can swap that look with. Just both be low key evil. That‚Äôs the soulmate dream.
@Jessmuir0407 I try not to let on the level of which I aspire to be them because I feel it reveals too much about how I‚Äôm a horrible person
Thank you @kcrw for playing Transatlanticism as we drove through the hills with the windows down. Perfection.

Oh sure, today I don‚Äôt go hiking. Also, it‚Äôs just too damn hot to be outside. Like WAY too hot.
A great night with @girlsrocksela, fundraising for summer camp. Check their page out and get‚Ä¶ 
@kellydirck I almost answered the door for the pizza man with no pants. It‚Äôs a solid day.
@Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôve been to the class they‚Äôre spoofing and it‚Äôs basically exactly like this and I‚Äôm cracking up.
Oh my god, I got to the Spirit Cycle episode of Kimmy Schmidt and I almost choked on my pizza. Also, hai Jon Hamm.
@msxdx That song totally reminds me of you, haha.
I am so excited to spend tomorrow with my little sunshine, even if it does mean being outside in 90-degree heat.
@provvidenzarage Yes. I second this.
@jessmuir0407 You could try a hot towel? Just not too hot so you don't burn yourself but that helps to clear the sinuses a bit.
@jessmuir0407 I'm telling you dude, a heating pad. It helps a ton.
Remember when my whole family was in Arizona for @Dodgers spring training and I'm stuck in process training? #sendhelp
@manamitru Huh. I hope the kid doesn't know that. I have a  feeling that's where I'll be tomorrow night if she does.
@manamitru Cinderella is out already?
@msxdx seriouslyyyyyyy
@msxdx Seriously. Or like‚Ä¶buy some new clothes from Target.
@msxdx People have too. much. fucking. money.
@thatbianca I usually just start kicking.
@pho_fur Hahahaha omg I thought that was a fake account
@jessmuir0407 Work.

@jessmuir0407 It's so crazy. It basically gets crazier.
@jessmuir0407 Yep. That was a thing that happened.
@denbac I have that on mine.

@evilapprentice Perfecto. Let the fundraising begin.
@evilapprentice I already have binoculars (for decoration, #nocreepy), I just need to place to slumber.
@evilapprentice Can I borrow your tent?
@evilapprentice I will now recruit a host for a fundraising dinner to pay off my student loans.
Obama, 0. Angie, 1. Got to work just as the cops were starting to shut down the street. Whew.
Coming up in the 7am hour, Angie v. #ObamaJam. The great battle of go-kart and motorcade. Patience and car reliability. Singing and crying.
@Jessmuir0407 Yeah, hard pass on that one.
Also, I cannot express how NOT excited I am for Lena Dunham.

Good poker face at Paley from the #Scandal cast. Someone asked if we would see Huck‚Äôs family again and welp, there they are.
Oh hi #Castle commercial. I‚Äôve missed you.
Oh Olivia is just straight drinking from the bottle now. Welcome to my world boo. #Scandal
There‚Äôs apparently a fire down the street but #Scandal is about to come on so‚Ä¶we‚Äôre staying.

@DaraCreasey Tease, but also educational. Well played.

@jessmuir0407 My first question would be to ask for a ride, my second question would start "So‚Ä¶about these student loans‚Ä¶"
@jessmuir0407 I would like to make this happen.
@carriecornish I don't know man, but I take Pico to work, so he kind of just ruined my whole plan. Haha.
I think Obama should give me a ride to work tomorrow, since he's basically going to make my commute impossible. #LosAngeles
@jessmuir0407 Yeah, basically. Haha
Yesterday, 70 degrees and cloudy as hell. Today, 89 degrees and my sinuses are PISSED.
If you all haven't checked out @oncenina, I highly suggest you do because you're missing out.‚Ä¶ 
The @youngstory Big Show tonight was amazing. It's a beautiful thing when children's imaginations are‚Ä¶ 
@manamitru @katrak @evilapprentice IRL things happen and I'm like yeah, okay whatever. I cry fairly frequently over this damn show.
@manamitru @katrak @evilapprentice The show is the only thing that proves I'm not completely dead inside tbh
@katrak @evilapprentice @manamitru I like your jokes Kate. They're funny.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @katrak But then I can go on my runs without fear‚Ä¶
@manamitru @evilapprentice @katrak My team is genuinely concerned.
@manamitru @evilapprentice @katrak There was a very lengthy discussion among co-workers about my mental well being when this show ends.
@manamitru @katrak @evilapprentice I would rather be spoiler catching than invoicing right now. BELIEVE ME.
@manamitru @katrak @evilapprentice I'll take my try at spoiler catching someday.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @katrak I wouldn't even get to say #hi because I would DIE immediately. Probably.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @katrak Depends who I get to say #hi to.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @katrak That is a 5 mile run total. If I stop to say #hi, I die. Not worth it.
@evilapprentice @manamitru @katrak Haha, yeah. There's stalkers kind of a lot? I see them when I drive home too.
@manamitru @katrak @evilapprentice I wonder what I'm capable of getting‚Ä¶nothing probably
@katrak @manamitru @evilapprentice What Kate said‚Ä¶
@jessmuir0407 Yep. Claire is the BEST.
@jessmuir0407 It takes a little bit
I‚Äôm legit waiting for Rains of Castamere to start playing at work today.
@jessmuir0407 You'll probably find Frank Underwood attractive in ways that you can't explain, but just go with it.
@jessmuir0407 Does this happen every season or is it this season in particular?
@Jessmuir0407 Oh lord, what happened now?
@denbac Right? I can only handle a couple episodes at a time. It‚Äôs too short to skip. Haha
@ADRNNWLLMS I will be there. Bringing a friend. Go kid.
@evilapprentice I'm only 5 episodes in. Maybe it'll grow on me. But right now it's driving me nuts, haha.
Am I the only one that can't stand the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt theme song?
@denbac I WANT
@Abigail_Hope_ I got some delicious cheddar they were giving samples of. That was my dinner, haha.
Tomorrow, I get to go to my first Big Show for @youngstory &amp; then see all my friends at @OnceNina‚Äôs album release! I know some rad people.
Fun fact: I did so many squats today that I now look like I‚Äôm walking around drunk despite the fact that I‚Äôve had not a drop of alcohol.
Dinner is tough when your intestines hate all food. I can only eat so many crackers.
@Jessmuir0407 @manamitru I agree with that.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Step away from the drugs bro. Or share. Whatever.
@manamitru Aw man‚Ä¶well, I‚Äôm glad to hear nothing is broken!
@jessmuir0407 oh my godddd why don't I have cable?!
@jessmuir0407 Tell me more.
Don't go on a run one evening and then wear ballet flats to work the next day. #NoSupport #ouchcentral
I'm taking a call in a hallway because the dude is still under the desk and that's the way that things are going here today.
@jessmuir0407 Jess. He's sitting UNDER THE DESK.
@thatbianca Oh, I get it. I was smiling so big when I got mine. It's a big accomplishment!
There's a guy sitting under the desk next to me. I know he's adjusting it, but it's still very weird and I would like him to leave.
@thatbianca YAYYYYY! Congrats my friend!
@rjalias Nope. Do not want. I'm good. Thanks.
@carriecornish I will. It's not so much the tests but the getting time off and figuring out how to pay for it.
@carriecornish I've been having digestion/diet issues &amp; I thought it was stress, but finally went to the doctor and they want more tests. :/
Doctor results, not great. I have a lot of appointments to make. Cue the stress.
@sarahmazing Oh, I still followed it. Saving it for later, haha.
@sarahmazing The first song is Nirvana? Yes. This is what I'm looking for. I thought playing "I Hate My Job" would be excessive. Haha
Seriously Spotify, I don't want a "let's make your day better" playlist. I want loud, pissed off music.
I need a Spotify playlist of "do not disturb" music. Not in a fun way. In a "if you talk to me I might punch you" way.
Oh my sunshine, I just love you more than I could ever say. You can stop growing up now. I won't‚Ä¶ 
Dying laughing. #JaneTheVirgin
But seriously, hearing my name in this episode is equal parts weird and awesome. And @HereIsGina and @AnthonyVO say it great. #JaneTheVirgin
This whole scene with Xo and Rogelio is basically perfect. #JaneTheVirgin
Rogelio is my fave. #JaneTheVirgin
This show always makes me miss my Grandma but makes me super happy at the same time. #JaneTheVirgin
Well, that was adorable‚Ä¶and then awkward. But still adorable. #JaneTheVirgin
Fangirl Jane=me basically 90% of the time. #JaneTheVirgin
Hey @JaneWriters, on behalf of all Angelique‚Äôs everywhere, thanks for using our name. This is making me super happy.
Okay, #TheBachelor. We're done. It's #JaneTheVirgin time!
@MonicaTamLA You are seriously the 5th person to tell me that in the last week. That alone is stressing me out, haha.
@MonicaTamLA This is the first time I've  related to any of these girls...well, that's not alcohol related. #CommitmentPhobia
If someone tried to make me move to a cornfield, I would cry. Mostly because I don‚Äôt like corn. Except elotes, obviously. #TheBachelor
@MistyMichelle Bring him to me. I need him.
It worries me that I‚Äôm still not tired. Like at all. I ran five miles. What has this Red Bull done?
@CarrieCornish @people Right?! Such a dick move.
My first outdoor run of the season, since it's apparently Spring and the sun likes to party longer. I‚Ä¶ 
@evilapprentice I thought it would better for me to just keep running. Say #hi while continuing to move.
@evilapprentice No, they were just sitting on the sidewalk by the parking structure, haha.
Were there #Castle fans hanging out outside Raleigh today? I was going to stop and ask but I was afraid if I stopped running I would die.
I CAN GO ON OUTSIDE JOGS AGAIN! This is really the only positive of the time change. Studio run is totally happening today as celebration.
@evilapprentice How long are you raising money for? Remind me on Friday when I get paid!
@RJalias $69! I‚Äôm just waiting for them to go down on Amazon so I can use my gift card <SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
@rjalias I'll double check when I get home. Haha
@rjalias Ah! That makes sense. Haha. No, I don't think so. I want to say I would have remembered seeing those but I'm kind of a spaz so idk
@rjalias Haha! I'm like uhmm, yes? No? Haha. I got a base set I think, since they didn't come in a box? I don't know what autos are. Haha
@rjalias Yeah! They're from S3 &amp; S4 so I love them all.
@rjalias I think that's the one I have. Roku HD? It works pretty well, I just want something faster. And yes, I did!
@nelcolleen I have a ton of episodes on here, I just forgot. Haha
@manamitru I need something to entertain me when I have to work late, haha.
@manamitru The bastards. I have a bunch of season 5/6 on here too but am in meetings all afternoon.
@banniss5 I like it, I just have that and a Chromecast and want to settle it down a bit. Convince someone to buy it from me, haha.
@manamitru I have Cuffed on here too. What have I been doing with my life?
I just realized I could've watched Always with you all because I have it on my work laptop. Dammit.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru @banniss5 Yes, she's evil.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 @banniss5 I like cats, but my brothers cat is not nice or cuddly and I'm not about that life.
Real Talk: Does anyone need/want a Roku? I'm switching to Apple TV and want it to find a nice home. I would also like a little grocery money
Happy Birthday Grandpa. Missing you. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
@youwouldgirl Ooo girl, that was my life last week. Asking for references is terrifying to me. Haha
@thatbianca Me too! I just listened to it and I really love it. It still sounds like them, but different enough to keep it interesting.
@thatbianca Have you heard the new Mumford and Sons song yet? I need your thoughts.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru Ohhhh, yes. Those are my favorite. Haha
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru That's my identifier at work. I get introduced to people like "Oh, this is Angie. She really likes Castle."
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru Yep, that's the one. Thank you. Haha. I only have this one on my work laptop: 
@katrak Aw man. Yeah girl, you need cinnamon in there, otherwise is just ends up tasting like a banana scrambled egg.
@ktofalvey9 Haha! Yep. Every time I'm waiting at the station, I get irrationally paranoid that someone is going to push me onto the tracks.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 *insert pouty Beckett picture that I don't have saved on this computer*
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru IT COUNTS. I'm holding Mariana responsible for buying me a new laptop. :P
If anyone is planning on buying the gold Apple Watch, please buy me a gold MacBook bc you clearly have too much fucking money. #AppleEvent
@miss_tenenbaum OH MY GOSH your avatar is SO precious
@manamitru WHY IS IT ONLY GOOD FOR A YEAR? DOES IT BLOW UP?
@manamitru Wait, WHAT?
@castlefreak811 I cry about this fairly regularly
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru #ATP buddy: pepper spray and walking really fast
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru In order of life priorities: get a raise/new job, new macbook, pay off student loan, get a car, get a dog. Haha
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru The only way I'm getting a bigger apartment is if I live with the boy and that's a scarier commitment than the dog.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru Dog. I have a dog that my Mom has taken so I want to get another dog. And then another dog so he has a buddy. Haha
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I have a rescue that lives with my Mom and she wants to keep him now so I'm going to rescue another when I can.
@jessiekaiser Killing in the Name is always my go-to.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Yay! Okay. And I want a dog SO bad. My apartment is too small and I work 7am-7pm. Not fun for a dog :(
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru Find me an #ATP buddy.
@jj_newberry *looks at $25 in bank account*
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 Haha, I won't. It's actually not that bad since I've grown up here. I'm just always alone which is the bad part.
Hey, @Apple‚Ä¶can I sell you my college MacBook and get the new sexy one? I'm an adult now, which is why I can't afford to buy it on my own.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I live the hood life which is why I go on my jogs to the studios because my chances of getting stabbed decrease lol
@manamitru I just saw that. I'm having a meltdown.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru It's pretty easy here since I have pepper spray and general self-defense training. Yayyy Los Angeles.
@marshiebcakes Maybe 9 hours when I'm stuck in the damn forest or something with no free Wi-Fi
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru Oh I'm all about the #ATP life now. #RIPEdTheCar
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 I like that I don't have a functioning car but I'm like yesss new laptop.
@marshiebcakes Like, do you know how much time I spend on the internet? All day. Except when I'm showering and sometimes not even then.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru *prays for good tax return*
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru EXPLAIN YOURSELF
‚Äú@ABC7: New MacBook  has all-day battery life 
@manamitru It's so much, but it's so right.
@carriecornish Yeah, I'm over it. I think I'm just going to give it to my brother or the kid or someone.
I just got an iPad mini, but I'm gonna need that gold MacBook because it's equal parts tacky and fabulous‚Ä¶ &amp; my notebook is OLD #AppleEvent
@jessmuir0407 She and Guillermo are stealing each others phones
@carriecornish I have a Roku, but it's been loading Sling SO slowly so I had been looking into an Apple TV. I'm glad I waited. Also HBO!
Red Bull update: I'm already shaking uncontrollably.
@jessmuir0407 I refuse to purchase cable and couldn't justify spending $100 for AppleTV but now I can cover most with a gift card.
The price of an AppleTV dropped? Excellent. Now I can finally get one.
I listen really well to the whole "don't drink caffeine" thing. Hey, it was free and I've had no‚Ä¶ 
My timeline is basically a #Castle love fest and it‚Äôs just brightening up my whole morning.

Happy 6th Anniversary!!‚Äù Who knew?! And 7 Seasons later‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve gotten so little sleep this weekend that it honestly feels like it‚Äôs been one long day. I am gonna rest delightfully tonight.
@evilapprentice The love is real for that banana pudding.
Okay, last one because it's fantastic and you can feel the general emotional meltdowns happening.‚Ä¶ 
@evilapprentice Yes, good deal. Baby Blues will have to happen.
@evilapprentice Oh seriously?! Sooo weird! I don‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt speak to anyone. I just stayed in the corner terrified with my friend.
@evilapprentice Ooo, very sneaky. I was in the last row so I didn't even try, haha.
@evilapprentice I did not get to say #hi, but there really wasn‚Äôt a chance. Small panel, much more aggressive people. Too sick, haha.
.waits for everyone to lose their shit over that tweet in 3‚Ä¶2‚Ä¶.1*
@evilapprentice I mean, I selfishly want one because I‚Äôm not a stalker and I was sick last time and want another shot.
@paladoga I want to go next Sunday for Jane the Virgin. Don‚Äôt know if you watch it, but I haven‚Äôt got my tix yet.
Also, I need another Castle panel like‚Ä¶kind of soon.
Tonight, solidified my love for the cast of Scandal and general disdain for un-moderated fan Q&amp;A‚Äôs. See you next Sunday #PaleyFest!
@evilapprentice Bam.
@evilapprentice If I could up-vote the boom box question, I would.
@tonygoldwyn I wouldn‚Äôt encourage it bro‚Ä¶
@denbac I thought I was ready, I was wrong.
@Jessmuir0407 I just hate un-moderated fan Q&amp;As. They‚Äôre super cringey and some people just don‚Äôt know when to shut. it. down.
Queen Kerry. But seriously, this woman handled some real awkward moments tonight with serious class.‚Ä¶ 
#TeamAttractiveMales #PaleyFest #Scandal @ Dolby Theatre 
Oh, hello Mr. President. #PaleyFest #Scandal @ Dolby Theatre 
This panel is getting supppeerrrr weird. #PaleyFest
. @kerrywashington is class personified. Get it girl. #PaleyFest #ScandaI
Super awkward when Jimmy Kimmel read all @alexalala‚Äôs tweets about @tonygoldwyn. #PaleyFest
#Paleyfest #Scandal @ Dolby Theatre 
HERE WE GO! #PaleyFest #Scandal
A low-power power nap and a hell of a lot of concealer later, I'm ready to get my fangirl on at my‚Ä¶ 
Hello friends, come to our yard sale. 
@Jessmuir0407 That one was mildly terrifying. This one will be terrifying because it‚Äôs at the theater where the Oscars are so lots of people
@Jessmuir0407 I‚Äôm so excited. It‚Äôs going to be terrifying. Haha
@Jessmuir0407 Yep! It's tonight!
Happy #InternationalWomensDay to all the beautiful, amazing women in my timeline. You all kick ass, all day, every day.
I'm pretending these lights are the sun because I've had 5 hours of sleep in 48 hours and I'm praying‚Ä¶ 
Alright @Dominos, @Postmates and @TenderGreens lose. You‚Äôre up. Hell, anyone is up at this point. Send food immediately.
So, our @Postmates order never showed up and we can‚Äôt get a hold of our driver. This is fantastic. I didn‚Äôt want to eat tonight anyway.
Randall Cobb is re-signed <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
.@chrishemsworth is on Twitter. My timeline just got immeasurably better. No offense. I still love you all.
As we were cleaning out my Grandparent's house, I started collecting little things. Some had meaning,‚Ä¶ 
@alexalala hey yo, what‚Äôs the plan for tomorrow?
@miss_tenenbaum FUCK DOUG MAN
#yardsale 
Note to self: if you‚Äôve become allergic to something, but some damn Benedryl. Fuck you secret strawberries. #rashcityUSA
@evilapprentice We‚Äôre clearing out my Grandparent‚Äôs house and have to be there at 6am. My family hates sleep, apparently.
I have to be up at 5am the rest of the weekend. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><PISTOL>
.@iamjmsn at #FirstFridays. Rad dude, rad music. @ Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County 
@StacyRaeG Haha, no sorry! Everything place I know is on the west side.
Roar. #FirstFridays @ Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County 
@pineknuts Shake Shack for those that cannot my friend i.e.: me
I'm super excited to see @iamjmsn tonight. I'm also hoping the shady tuna sandwich I ate for lunch won't kill me first.
@carriecornish She's funny. I hope she is.
@alwayscastle47 Comedy is cheaper to produce.
@yogurtgarol The only time I've ever heard my full name used is on Maury. Delightful. Haha
@cithrins Shhh. Don't blow my cover.
@evilapprentice That's a good point. #RIPShana
FINALLY! Thank you @CWJaneTheVirgin for using my name for a character that is not a stripper. Or is she? I don't know. We shall see.
@msxdx YES LETS GOOOO
@jessmuir0407 Haha, two names. Both great.
Someone come see Little Dragon and Hot Chip with me at the @GreekTheatreLA this summer. Alright thanks.
One day, I will learn that the chest pain that I get from drinking coffee outweighs the need to feel awake. Today is not that day.
When your first bus arrives at the stop just as the transfer is pulling up. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> #smallvictories #buslife
I‚Äôm going to start wearing shirts with spikes on the shoulders on the bus so strangers can‚Äôt fall asleep on me.
@Jessmuir0407 Dogs are serious. The only difference between a dog and a baby is they pee outside and you can leave them alone longer. Lol
@Jessmuir0407 Dog.
@bbygray I really need to watch X-Files. I keep switching off of it and forgetting to go back so then I just start over.
@bbygray What are you binge watching?
Morning walk. #LosAngeles #Normandie @ Hotel Normandie Los Angeles 
@CarrieCornish I can‚Äôt wait for Sundayyyyyy
@CarrieCornish I cried. Like a lot.
That took it out of me.
Go hold each other close tonight.
Let's love the hate right out of this world.
See you ‚Ä¶
And I‚Äôm bawling. I plan to take this up personally with the entire cast on Sunday. #PaleyFest #ScandaI
It‚Äôs too bad there can‚Äôt be justice served like this in real life, huh? #Scandal
Holy. Effing. Hell. This. Episode. #ScandaI
‚ÄúTalk faster or say less‚Äù #NewLifeMotto #ScandaI
. @kerrywashington is KIL-LING IT this episode. This is the #ScandaI I love.
Yessss Oliva, yes. #Scandal
@msxdx Aw hell no. Well, if you need anything or a couch to crash, I'm super close so just let me know. :)
@Jessmuir0407 motherfucker haha
@msxdx Girl. Want me to drop off food?
@Jessmuir0407 Yep. Why?
Harrison Ford is okay, which means I'm okay. Back to business people.
@lafemmeluna I've literally seen four different trauma levels on my timeline. I'm gonna go with moderate if he was talking and alert.
@carriecornish Yay me too!
Nervously picks arm while in a meeting. Arm starts to bleed. Spends rest of the meeting worrying about how much arm is going to bleed #idiot
@pho_fur I can't stop staring at it.
@flamingovision I know I need to go. It usually happens after I eat which is why last night was so confusing because I ate very little.
@jessmuir0407 That's why I added the -ish.
My mom just posted a TBT. And used a hashtag. What the hell world am I living in?
‚Äú@Dodgers: FINAL: Dodgers 6, White Sox 1 #WeLoveLA‚Äù Oh good, we can still win things-ish.
@pho_fur GOOD GOD ITS LIKE PORN WATCHING THIS DUDE PITCH 
In case anyone is into that #TBT Music life, I highly recommend hanging out in the mid-90's here: 
#TBT to tortilla making with Grandma. Living the Mexibaby life. 
@msxdx yayayayay!
@grande_lattte Dude, this is brutal. I honestly have no idea what‚Äôs causing it so I just blame wine. Haha
I basically had no dinner, drank only water and am in such tremendous intestinal pain it that might be an ER night. I blame lack of wine.
Engagements, work anniversaries, plaid and these pals. #thebox #winesday #nowineformethisisdumb @‚Ä¶ 
@bbygray Oh no! Sending you all good vibes. Poor little guy :(
@banniss5 @jessmuir0407 @manamitru Oh lordy. People give me a headache.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 But like..what are people mad? That's what I don't get. It's not like you all kept the leftover money.
@jessmuir0407 @manamitru I have missed 100% of this. My timeline is this weird little quiet corner.
@manamitru @jessmuir0407 At the end of the day, you made a lot of people happy‚Ä¶that's what counts. Screw the haters. ;)
@jessmuir0407 Seriously. That just brightened up my whole day. I get so happy when people come together for something cool like that.
