@AdidiPonders Scorpio?
@sparklebutch also, two mins before it started. Very confusing
@AdidiPonders idk what that is :o
@sparklebutch lol I'd stay in it so long in class. Something weird: I sleep on my tummy but last big earthquake I woke up in child's pose
@AdidiPonders how do you feel about Pisces?
@littlelull superwoman! :D
@orlikeawhale I'm so sorry D:
@sparklebutch 
@sparklebutch do you know how to do the bridge? Lay on a mat on ur back + slowly lift your pelvis til ur at a diagonal. Hold it.
@ThaxtonRobin hugs if wanted :( I'm so sorry he did this to you. You are wonderful &amp; loved &amp; cared about
It's been weeks, but 1st thing my favorite bartender asked me when I walked in was "How's the paper?" I told him I got an A &amp; he goes "GOOD"
@boldandworthy @sim91simma that is disgusting
@galactwee I've only seen the printout ones there, weird. Japantown is harder to get to
@sparklebutch I will post picks of the ones I use; physical therapist gave me a printout years ago. Gotta find em :O
@galactwee yes!!! They have a booth :3
@boldandworthy @sim91simma oh my god, my dad did that to me all the time growing up. You are NOT silly, that is abuse. That therapist SUCKS
A man at work actually ASKED me if he could take my picture; ppl rarely ask, I was so happy I said yes :) 
LRT :( 
@Makofury and it's all painfully, PAINFULLY unfair. And I'm so sorry.
@Makofury that's a good question :( the answer is that we live in a culture that punishes victims &amp; doesn't hold abusers accountable.
@gamefulscholar badass, hell yeah!!
@sparklebutch sorry :( do you do yoga? I have lower back stretches that help me
@galactwee we should go get those cute picture stickers done! I wanna stick em on EVERYTHING
@onthevraydar I'M SO STOKED! :D
all I'm really looking for in a romance is someone to duet "all I have" by jennifer lopez &amp; LL cool j with me
@onthevraydar Oh my gosh I am blushing so hard right now! thank you so much, you're awesome :) &lt;3
now there's glitter everywhere in my room &amp; I'm just pleased as punch
I untied a fancy bow yesterday &amp; a bunch of glitter fell out &amp; I SQUEALED WITH DELIGHT

glitter bombs would not work on me
@xyfemme yup!
@xyfemme we could go thrifting! I have some sheets you can have. I'll look through &amp; send pics of stuff
LRT: FUCK THIS VICTIM-BLAMING BULLSHIT
@onthevraydar I've never been exactly sure what that means. I just block people, haha
@Makofury I'm so sorry :(
Uhhh what &gt;:( 
@Aleks_S this is your space. this is what you're going through right now. you can share anything you want to share :)
@etiene_d 
@etiene_d noooooo D:

you'll get through this!!
@JamsEtYams chins are cute and yours is the cutest &lt;3
@dtwps I was worried you were talking about yourself for the first half of this tweet &amp; then I got REAL CONFUSED :O
I gotta catch up on elementary &amp; orphan black but all I'm doing with my time is watching more x-files 
this twitter is gonna turn into bad puns &amp; cat pictures 24/7, just watch
You don't need a res-

@boldandworthy you deserve so much better.
@boldandworthy I believe you.
@boldandworthy this makes me so goddamn angry, ugh, what complete fuckers &gt;:(

You are deceiving yourself.
@littlelull HUGS and cat &lt;3 you totally deserve a break! 
air bnb email: pack your bags, YOU'RE GOING TO LONDON!

nothing gives me anxiety faster than trying to plan my graduation trip

JUST ACCEPT MY AIRBNB OFFER. JUST DO IT &gt;:(
@onthevraydar your experiences and opinions are valid, thank you so much for sharing this with us :)
someone plz take me grocery shopping. there are no breakfast foods in my house, &amp; this is a TRAVESTY

@Makofury @Izz145 it's her space. She can express herself about someone who hurt her. Becca does this too.

@XOMeDeadly I'm really sorry you're going through this. funny how someone whose actions show clear bullying &amp; manipulation is accusing YOU
@XOMeDeadly I think the best recourse for everyone is to just stay the fuck away from her. She obviously has some weird agenda.
woke up to this armpit friend 
@MCSerf I think its connected to Harley Quinn, but I always liked having them as a pet in WoW
@dtwps those people suck, and I'm sorry :(
@dtwps that is some bullshit &gt;:( I'd start getting mean. Like calling in favors and yelling at ppl
@dtwps you said you reached out to your friends &amp; nobody can help you get groceries or do laundry?

You either support the person who has been victimized or you suppor…

@boldandworthy @LittleGee10 oh no, that is HORRIFYING. I am so sorry :(
@boldandworthy ty so much &lt;3 I care about you too :)
Emotional support &amp; encouragement really helps so much, on every level. It could've been a terrible day, but my coworkers made it good <THUMBS UP SIGN>
At work I ended up doing a bunch of stuff I wasn't scheduled for, &amp; doing it WELL. It was stressful but I got hi-fives &amp; lots of support :)
Such an exhausting day at work, I meant to do stuff but all I did was take a nap with my cat instead. She's snoring. It's ADORABLE <TWO HEARTS><CAT FACE>
why is my roommate's dirtbag husband in my house

WELP, guess it's time to go for a walk!
@xyfemme YAY!!
Cat: I threw up in your shoe
@orlikeawhale @GlitteryAnimal I'm sorry y'all :( I'm like this on fathers day
@BathysphereHat thank you so much. I'll probably take you up on that :)
It's unfortunate. Sometimes all people need to see is "you're gonna get through this" but I guess that can be hard to say.
How hard you're working to feel positive, sure! Cat pictures &amp; cooking? A+. 

But not the journey to feeling "ok." Not the pain &amp; isolation.
I rarely share my feelings on here cause nobody wants to hear about how much you're hurting.
it'd be nice to live in safety from harassment &amp; abuse, but for now, I can pretend everyone who yells @ me on the street just likes my hair
I know this makes it a distraction instead of making a real change, but it's helped me feel a bit safer. So.
...also, there's a general shift in street-harassment. Shitty dudes always comment on my hair instead of my body/etc. I feel...protected.
I love having bright pink &amp; purple hair. It makes people happy. It amazes children. It inspires strangers to hi-five me. I love it.
today another little girl whispered to her mom that I reminded her of the little mermaid, &amp; her mom told me. &amp; I almost cried a lil bit. wow
five goddamn years old &amp; married to gender binary ideals; it broke my fucking heart tbh. she said they weren't "girly" :'(
moment of the day: teaming up with a cool mom wearing a dinosaur sweater to convince her 5-yr-old that girls can like dinosaurs
I know that the abuse I've gone through is why I don't like to date/don't plan to in the future, but I still want love &amp; romance. So much.
I think my expectations of being single forever are connected to this; I want my partner to remind me of home. Hasn't happened. Might never.
"Home," to me, is a mixture of sensations, smells, &amp; memories that make up a place that doesn't actually exist.
I want real fall again. I want real seasons. I don't know how much longer I can stay in the bay area.
The only nostalgia I get for home is for how beautiful the fall is in the Ozarks. Crisp air, multicolored leaves, roaring fires, apple cider
@GlitteryAnimal boooo :(
Update: I ate the thing <DOUGHNUT><THUMBS UP SIGN>
...a coconut donut has been sitting all alone in the box for an hour. I might fall on that delicious sword...<DOUGHNUT><TWO HEARTS>
@brassiest thank you &lt;3
@dtwps writing is my JAM. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@dtwps I completely understand. I hope it helps you heal :)
I'm so tired I was dreading work, but someone brought donuts, I'm at my favorite position, &amp; we're all singing Sugar Ray songs so <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@BathysphereHat I'm sorry, that's awful :(
@ArchetypeBlue comixology works pretty well for me. Tried it?
@MCSerf gross &gt;:(
@xyfemme good morning! I don't remember my dreams, but sleeping helped my back hurt less so I'm ready for the workday :D
@xyfemme 
@brassiest thank you so much. it's been months &amp; we literally made our own support group cause nobody gave a shit...this means so much &lt;3
@AdidiPonders to yours too, thank you :)
Believe abused women.
Believe black women.
Believe abused women.
Believe black women.
Believe abuse…
@conlan_webster IT IS. bbq is the best :D
rt for eternal void
@AdidiPonders thank you so much, I'm gonna cry. feels so weird to have people care about us instead of coddle our abuser. it's been months
@galactwee well duh yeah 24/7 all day every day c'mon
@galactwee I tried to remove blackheads with honey and cinnamon and NOTHING HAPPENED

...it smelled nice, tho
@dtwps is there any way you can tell me who that is? the victim-blaming partner of my abusive ex is in there too :(
Tw:murder

horrifying. 
@AdidiPonders I'm really glad. Its a goddamn difficult process, dealing with trauma. I just started therapy for this Jetta crap :/
@AdidiPonders I am so sorry :(

That is horrifying.
@ThaxtonRobin @onthevraydar you're both awesome &lt;3
@7pee5 *sends love &amp; support* :(

@7pee5 well shit if she just wants us to properly advocate for ourselves, she should be pretty darn happy with our efforts right now.

"But I'm not an abuser — I don't identify as one" 

Why, you ask?

She doesn…
@galactwee gross. I'm sorry :(

@littlelull THIS IS TRULY A SHOCK AND WILL BE EVERY TIME I NOTICE A NEW HARMLESS IMPERFECTION
@cypheroftyr bonus round: "I heard vomiting noises BUT I DON'T SEE ANY VOMIT!"
YES, IT IS TRUE, YOU HAVE CREATED A HUMAN THAT SOMETIMES GETS CALLUSES ON ITS FEET. ALSO, HAS BODY HAIR.

@GlitteryAnimal grats!!! :)
@KivaBay maybe make everything private and disengage for a little bit? This could get super overwhelming :(
Doing mother's day early cause we both work. Its also really good therapy, considering how much bullshit happened yesterday
My favorite part of this mother daughter pedicure is being professionally bossed by our awesome technicians. Assertive women <THUMBS UP SIGN> <NAIL POLISH><REVOLVING HEARTS>
@sophiaphotos I'm so sorry :(

me: it's a surprise
@FemHype aww, I'm feminist &amp; covered in pink! It looks great though :)
Pretty simple, y'all. Don't wanna be labelled an abuser? DON'T ABUSE PEOPLE. 
@tauriqmoosa @INeedDivGms wow, even the style of it is making me anxious. Gonna add it to my list of "games that are cool but too real," ha


@ArchetypeBlue I wanna live in that world. Please just remember: not everyone gets the opportunity to avoid conflict. To remain "neutral."
@satanandsolomon when I have to tolerate abuse for financial reasons I make an appearance, say I'm sick &amp; avoid ppl/lock doors/hide.
@satanandsolomon fuck this is complex. I know how this is...the financial dependency is such a primary issue. can you go, then be "sick?"
@boldandworthy @7pee5 you are wonderful and brave, thank you :)
@boldandworthy @7pee5 thank you so much yukio &lt;3
@kadybat hugs accepted &amp; returned! :) safe wishes to you 
@kadybat I dyed my hair pink originally because I felt eyes on me &amp; I wanted to give them a goddamn reason. Staring jerks &gt;:(

with your abuse culture gaslighted as radical politics
@Fluxfoxphoto do itttt
Spent the day at work singing "Over the Garden Wall" songs to myself; gonna end it singing this: 
@Makofury ...which is why this community is such prime real estate for abusers.
@Makofury yeah silence and victim blaming is always easier. even when the victims are also queer and/or trans.
EVERYONE SHOULD BE CALLED OUT ON AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. EVERYONE.
Good god the PHRASING. "Yeah I'm abusive but c'mon, cis women get away with abuse why can't I?!!" what the fuck. 
@7pee5 *hugs* :(
Ugh it's just all so disappointing. I dated her cause she had a good reputation in the community; &amp; doesn't she still? Ppl protect abusers.


@orlikeawhale she talks real pretty when she's trying to escape any and all consequences for her actions.
She set up a situation, her own redemption narrative, &amp; when we didn't all play along she pitched a fit &amp; threw it all out the window. No.
How the fuck am I supposed to feel safe going to bay area gaming/queer events when she LITERALLY FUCKIN SAID "sorry not sorry"?!
How the fuck am I supposed to magically believe that she'll stick to her own terms when she says this?! 
Jetta's public statements originally sounded fine to me. My issue? She recanted them. 
@rivenhomewood it's just a fancy way of excusing yourself. you "hurt people," which is way less serious let's just be chill everyone!!!
@ThaxtonRobin @GlitteryAnimal @deckycoss "..so anyways, sorry or whatever to xandir, kyra, and...*looks at smudged writing on hand* kate?"
@ThaxtonRobin @GlitteryAnimal @deckycoss yeah she name-dropped me but got my name wrong? She called me Kate. Amazing.
because that is TOTALLY HOW THAT WORKS please enjoy this new loophole
ATTENTION ALL ABUSERS! If u admit to abusing but say u don't "identify as an abuser," if ur victims don't shut up, u are now the victim!
@deckycoss @GlitteryAnimal she put my fucking name in there and I hadn't publicly called her out. i was still in shock
do whatever the fuck you want to people; as long as you make a big show of apologizing &amp; saying you'll try to do better, you'll get cookies!
all you gotta know is how to manipulate/appropriate social justice lingo, befriend some social justice "celebs," &amp; you're home-free!
Most important thing I've learned after dating an abuser who is in/supported by SJ twitter: this is an A+ place for abusers to hide
transformative justice coulda been something so good, but abuser-enablers &amp; victim-blamers had to go and fuckin ruin it &gt;:(
"Exile culture" &amp; "transformative justice" are BS phrases used to silence &amp; further marginalize victims. Fuck that. #transfauxmativejustice
Exile Culture: because won't somebody think about the abusers/rapists?!!! :( #exileculture #abuserdynamics
Exile Culture: victim-blame &amp; perpetuate mainstream rape culture while maintaining a facade of social justice! #abuserdynamics #exileculture
@ThaxtonRobin "won't someone think of the abusers/rapists?!!!"
@ThaxtonRobin I am so sorry :(

@GlitteryAnimal what? Even with you being an adult? Are you ok?


I don't forgive abusers.
my therapist told me I am very brave &amp; amazing for facing abuse in my life. that's such a wonderful thing to hear..we should all say it more
Frustrating: when you block shitty popular ppl but others, instead of RTing them, REPOST THEIR SHIT. Do I have to block EVERYONE?!
Women do this too. All my abusers are like this, &amp; they're women (I know she's focusing on men, but this resonated) 
@sparklebutch I'm sorry :( hot water bottle?
@boldandworthy I'm so sorry yukio. I know that feeling :(
@ThaxtonRobin I'm so glad!! It's super tough to start therapy, I'm proud of you :)
glad I'm talking about abuse/SA stuff on this, the day of therapy. I'll have so much to share! now excuse me I need to archive something
@ThaxtonRobin you wanna talk about it?
When I don't have school or work to worry about, I cook breakfast food <COOKING> 
@MCSerf it can literally mean anything. My experience of "human nature" will always be different from yours.
@MCSerf "human nature" is such a nebulous concept...its a fallacy, not an explanation. I'd caution against using it.

@sparklebutch it was a pretty benign moment, but it upset me that she thought I was honestly negative. She barely listened to me, haha
@sparklebutch she was laughing at me when I was being sarcastic, &amp; said she'd never met anyone more negative than her before. I was bothered
@mo_ranyart 
Isn't that what fighting for social justice &amp; equality is all about? Human rights, &amp; empathy?
Believing that things can get better, that we can all be kinder &amp; more empathetic, is the only thing that keeps me going.
It cracks me up that my shitty ex called me negative; I'm reminded every day that I'm the most hopeful, optimistic person I know.
@MCSerf I'm a historian who's 100% fucking tired of the horrors humanity is capable of, but I'm still optimistic. We do good, too.
I felt super restless all day, so I ate a banana &amp; started watching more x-files. I think I made the right choice <THUMBS UP SIGN><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN>
@MCSerf may I suggest the mute button? Lol I lean HEAVILY on it
@galactwee an excuse for PRETTY PRETTY DRESSES
@MCSerf yeeeeeah I've had him muted for a long time now. Yikes.
@ellaguro I am so sorry :(
@sparklebutch I do that sometimes too :) it's nice

are you donating it?
@sparklebutch is it a clothes swap or something?
This is the first time I've eaten today, but as you can see, I am not fuckin around 
@GlitteryAnimal I'm sorry sugar :(
@mo_ranyart is there anything I can do to help you?
@mo_ranyart did you eat?
I'm in bed with tea, cat, &amp; comic books. Self-care is STRONG today <FLEXED BICEPS> 
@mo_ranyart hugs if wanted :(
@deckycoss we don't know each other, but I know this feeling, &amp; if you ever wanna talk I'll be here for you.
@XOMeDeadly you did the right thing. Thank you for trying to protect us all :)
@mo_ranyart you deserve to eat lunch!! Do you wanna talk about it? :(
@onthevraydar @XOMeDeadly yeah just keep your blocking at the ready :(

it's not your fault for not knowing
it is very difficult to find someone willing to talk about trauma at the same time when you are
@xyfemme I'm so sorry sugar

Just let me know if you wanna come stay with me, ok? You're always welcome. We could cook together!!

@KivaBay Aw I can't play that game...too real. This comic already sounds awesome, though :)
@conlan_webster yessss bunnies &lt;3

@whatthezach I'll look into it, thanks! Gritty stuff can be distracting too...when I'm upset I lean towards sweet, simple games :)
I really need a distraction. If anyone knows of any cute indie games, I'd really appreciate a rec
I only got one day of elation after my thesis was finished before the traumatic realities of the world dragged me back down to the shit.
She's not wrong. I tried so hard to make this a safer space for me, but I can't fully protect myself from the abusive people here.
My best friend came to stay with me this weekend, &amp; made a rule that I couldn't use twitter while she was here. She thinks it's toxic.
@BathysphereHat apparently now they are! I'm stoked to read it :D
Picked these for #FreeComicBookDay cause of course I did, haha

me everyday: oh this person seems cool, maybe we can be twitter friends!
them: *retweets my abuser*
Me: 
@galactwee FUCK YEAH
@nymgamer aw anytime! thank you for listening :)
Shoutout to @galactwee for letting me play games at their house! I've been itching to play animal crossing again
Being an active gamer is so frigging expensive though. Yikes.

GOTTA pay/support devs, but games need to stay affordable/accessible
I put my two cents in on the cost of gaming for @nymgamer here! 

I'm super lucky to be able to play at ALL tbh

@xyfemme I'm really glad hon!! I'm sorry about the room...you'll find something, I just wish it could be easier on you :(

thanks for coming through for me this time, buddy
@TheQuinnspiracy yup that's how it works.
The dad said "Wow good answer" &amp; the son looked baffled as hell, haha
That's not what he wanted to hear, ha, so I said "Go here, go to a public school. Higher chance of experiencing diversity &amp; empathy"
I said "Is that on the east coast?" They said yeah. I said "Go here, west coast is better"

@boldandworthy He's a terrible person and his actions are unforgivable, I am so sorry. Hugs if wanted :( 
@XOMeDeadly you're a badass, and I support you! You got this :)
@XOMeDeadly omg isn't she?! I freaking love my grumpy old grandma cat &lt;3
I keep taking cat breaks for my sanity while  writing my thesis. Natasha is very cuddly &amp; supportive <LEOPARD><REVOLVING HEARTS><SPARKLING HEART> 
@Izz145 well, that's pretty fucked up. I'm learning so much tonight. Really happy that I stay out of a lot of the "famous" SJW circles.
@onthevraydar @Izz145 it's a pretty effective silencing technique, since as soon as they say it nobody wants to touch the conversation.
@boldandworthy I believe you, and I'm so sorry :(

#IStandWithYukio
@boldandworthy abusers are attracted to positions that give them close access/power over ppl, then they use it to gaslight :(
@boldandworthy horrifying, and not surprising at all. My ex was a "consent activist" who routinely crossed ppl's boundaries &amp; manipulated.
@Izz145 @conlan_webster That escalated quickly. I don't keep up with her tbh, was she being buddy-buddy with that transphobic person?
@conlan_webster @Izz145 the more followers you get, the more stressful everything gets. More negative attention/more pedestal BS. Ugh.
@Izz145 yeah...I'm the same way. I routinely unfollow ppl I don't become mutuals with, &amp; I self-censor to avoid big attention.
@Izz145 Fame, &amp; control. Easier to lower ppl's guard when they think you're fighting for Great Justice, that you're empathetic &amp; caring.
@xyfemme say you were sick! say you were on the moon, with steve!
@boldandworthy It really does. The social justice community is filled with abusive people who learn the lingo &amp; use it to hurt.
@boldandworthy One; admitted to doing abusive things while saying they weren't abuse, cause she doesn't "identify as an abuser."

@MCSerf god damn it I am so hungry, haha

I feel like our entire society needs a mandatory "respect personal space" class.
Luckily the coworker harasser is gone, but I still get to tolerate creepy dads &amp; sexually aggressive young men. &amp; women who just GRAB ME
It's so fucked up that even other women immediately question my story when I mention being sexually harassed at work.
There are peaceful protests all over #Baltimore right now. #FreddieGray 
Butterfly! 
The bus got in the way of me getting to school on time, so I grabbed some food &amp; went for a walk instead 

Usually folks just let you fuck up &amp; figure it out yourself, ha

SF is feeling friendly today
Ppl are so helpful today! Lady came over to tell me the train isn't working, then a guy got off the bus to tell me the 2nd door doesn't open
@littlelull I went through that. I took a long break from them &amp; I'm slowly getting involved again. If you wanna talk about it, I'm here.
ME: Is it possible to crash into a rainbow?
PILOT: Yes it's how most of you w…
@XOMeDeadly I'm so sorry.

these fuckin pedestals wreck everything.
@ireneista @infinite_ammo @NightInTheWoods oh dang does that count as a spoiler? I intentionally picked the most random moment, haha
oh shit I was having such a good day

then...an email from the federal loan office 
I would learn guitar just to play "Giant Woman"

maybe on a tiny tiny guitar

let's be as twee as possible with this
these cheesy garlic bread potato chips are not fuckin around
screenshots from Lost Constellation make the best wallpapers for real

I'm using this one! @NightInTheWoods 
I just remembered a little girl at work yesterday ran up to ask if I'd been on American Idol. She was SO EXCITED

I was like "what"
I went for a walk!

...to my local corner store, for a king cone &amp; a six pack

I AM A PARAGON OF HEALTH
They didn't even want the sunbeam until I wanted the sunbeam 
the Last Sunbeam is in the hallway right now, so I went &amp; sat in it.

a few seconds later both cats appeared &amp; demanded to share it. CATPILE
I don't use hashtags on twitter very often, but I make up for it with instagram over-tagging, haha

LOOK HOW CUTE THE NOODLE EMOJI IS

@orlikeawhale gillian is carrying the damn thing just through the strength of her eyerolls
@orlikeawhale lol I'm still halfway through season one

I'm just dramatic
@BathysphereHat oh god me too.

I'm a gesturer. I GESTURE
@orlikeawhale I'VE COME TOO FAR TO STOP NOW
@MCSerf I'm waiting for trades; bought/read the first one and LOVE IT, lent it out to several friends, haha
I've overestimated my binge-watching abilities

THERE ARE SO MANY X-FILES EPISODES

* Gets called out *

" We need to stop call-out culture"
I'm upset &amp; angry about the hypocrisy in social justice, but mostly I'm just tired &amp; worried. Ya'll. Protect each other, please.
This passage could be a bio for my ex, but Katherine is still friends with her. It's like she ALMOST gets it but not quite.
"...weapons and armor alike to win a social game only they fully understand."

I'm just looking at this &amp; I kinda want to cry.
"..we like to pretend we don’t have, and who cannily manipulate our honor-system-based rules, parleying them into.."
"..those who get a rush from being abusive, from clawing their way to the top of the invisible activist hierarchies..."
Just read this piece, &amp; there's one particular passage that I've been staring at for the past 20 minutes or so. 
@galactwee this is horrifying

"bio-hacking" is a phrase that I hadn't heard before &amp; now despise
@sparklebutch I'm sorry, Miles. I went through that a few weeks ago, it is the worse. I hope yours clears up fast!!
@Be_loved_Freak cute! :D


Slavery was "legal"
Colonialism was "legal"

Legality is a construct of the powerful

I forgot netflix had the x-files, I've never watched the whole show. I am gonna watch the whole show RIGHT NOW.

Or at least not side with the abusers???
cooking something was the right choice

bacon &amp; eggs makes everything better &lt;3
I was going to talk about my issues with my body &amp; gender but then I thought "why would I do that"

so I'm gonna go cook something

2) It "trickles down" to offshore banks
3) Government close…

A small child coughed on me &amp; it took all my training in customer service not to recoil. I get a gold star for the day
@cleammajor I like "The Movement" :)
@galactwee feels like its been talked about for so long...I'm so late with games, I thought it was out, ha
anyways obviously ppl are only here for tiny animal pictures so

WILD MICE!! 
&amp; there's nothing wrong with poly. but don't say my "fairytale romance" stuff is the NORM when I can't find 1 other person who shares it
this type of conversation is frustrating when my experience of "the norm" is ppl who want multiple partners, &amp; who prioritize sex
someone introduce me to this overwhelming amount of monogamous lesbians that would be great. every queer person I know is poly.
please, SOMEONE TELL ME.

All I want is a long-term monogamous relationship with a woman. If that's the norm, WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND?!
People talk a lot about fighting against "the norm," aka monogamy.

Uh where are these monogamous ppl?
@Aleks_S like ya do! :D
Yay I beat it! It was great! I screenshotted the hell out of it! SO MANY AWESOME GIRLS @NightInTheWoods
@Aleks_S I'm so jealous, I want diner food.

can you share any memories?
The Huncher's music is my jam. @NightInTheWoods


BUY THIS GAME.

PLAY THIS GAME.

LOVE THIS GAME.

@NightInTheWoods
@galactwee I bought it, it's downloading. I trust your judgement :3
@conlan_webster nooo! is it closed on weekends?

I hide money in different places so I always have a lil bit, it makes me less anxious...
TW: murder, suicide, rape, abuse 
@nymgamer So much of the culture is based on being able to afford the NEXT BIG THING! I just look at my student loan &amp; think "maybe later"
@nymgamer it's true! and they're cheaper :P
@sparklebutch awww! :D
KITTENS!

@BathysphereHat it doesn't make any damn sense. It's inexcusable.
@BathysphereHat yeah I can understand that. I have no idea why she's messing up if ya'll have such a history! I'm mad at her.
@BathysphereHat yeah, new therapist :(

this is really awful
@misosusanowa yeah I've always played pve or rp servers in games; I can't be bothered worrying about randos attacking me
@misosusanowa aw...if the music and the graphics are immersive and pretty, it's definitely going on the list. I love beautiful scenery
@orlikeawhale I knew Turkey denied it but I didn't know that our government wouldn't officially call it a genocide. ughhhhh
@misosusanowa @rivenhomewood this is very important: is it PRETTY?
@misosusanowa @rivenhomewood yeah I'm not a big fan of that concept either. I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic overall
What the fuck is this? What. We can't even get the president to call it genocide?!


@misosusanowa @rivenhomewood hey thank you! that's really awesome :D

my friend is hyping up star citizen to me, heard of it? space mmo!
@misosusanowa @rivenhomewood nice! is that a fun game? I'm always looking for more to add to my leisurely list, haha
@_harperbole booooo.

so glad I'm not going to that one.
..I'm just now playing Animal Crossing for the first time (and I love it!), for example, haha. Still haven't beaten Sword&amp;Sworcery #yesIplay
#yesIplay and I'd play a lot more if I could, but I don't mind being behind on the latest stuff. I take my time with gaming :)
Exploration mode is where it's AT. All my best memories of WoW were just me wandering around seeing what I could interact with :)
I've been reading older articles; really loved this one by @beckysaysrawr 
@GidgetNomates I don't either. Greg is a great dad
@GidgetNomates whaaat who said that
I thought it would be ok if I just didn't let myself connect with the baby, but I can't cut myself off from somebody who did nothing wrong
I'm thinking about kids lately cause I've finally allowed myself to look at all the pictures &amp; videos of my nephew. Tried not to cry. Failed
...so I've relented on keeping a few of them, for my improbable imaginary future children. Sigh.
She insists on keeping some for "my future kids," despite me saying for years that having kids is highly unlikely in my future. HIGHLY.
No matter how many times we have this conversation, I can't convince my mom to give my nephew all our old baby books.
Came home early, so I made a spinach scramble with bacon then sat in a sunbeam with my cat. Friday done right <REVOLVING HEARTS>
Happy sunbeam baby <SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><HEART WITH ARROW> 
Never spoke to her before. That was odd, but nice? Haha
A woman sitting behind me on the bus got my attention &amp; said "have a good rest of the day!"
I said "Oh! You too!" &amp; now I'm a lil flustered
@BathysphereHat @nancykric its fucking disgusting and unacceptable.
@MCSerf I won't move til midsummer but I keep going through all my stuff over &amp; over &amp; downsizing. It's a constant process :/
@BathysphereHat @crimefish block anyone who says stuff like this &lt;3
@BathysphereHat ugh. That is unacceptable.
@littlelull we owe forgiveness to no one. Forgiveness is highly valued by abusers, cause it essentially lets them off the hook. NOPE.
Two giant jock bros yelled "CCSF? FUCK YEAH!!" at me cause I'm wearing a hoodie from there <FLEXED BICEPS><THUMBS UP SIGN>
The biggest thing I have in common with my two best friends is that we've all been abused &amp; we're REALLY FUCKING ANGRY ABOUT IT
All the power is out on campus. All the phone flashlights are also out. The bathroom was an EXPERIENCE.
Well my school is broken today
@BathysphereHat you need a new therapist


@galactwee you don't owe anybody anything. Do what you're comfortable with

now the brochure will more accurately reflect the tech industry!
@littlelull 
@sparklebutch aw dang. Do you have juice &amp; tea &amp; someone to help you? :(
yeah fuck it I'm out 
my cat woke me up at 3am &amp; in my sleepy state I thought it was cause she wanted me to test her new tabletop RPG

turns out she was hungry

Will you join me?

shoutout to my cat for keeping my bed warm for me

she is the true hero
oh my god I just realized there's a new steven universe

my crappy day just got SO MUCH BETTER &lt;3
Forever mistaking mannequins in stores for people. &amp; then apologizing to them. then remembering they aren't people again.
@BathysphereHat she really fucked up. I'm so sorry :(
@MCSerf its not a competition, and there's no limit on what we can discuss. We can call out everything and everyone that hurts people.
@BathysphereHat ...I always speak up when people start talking about "delicate situations" between social justice people.
@BathysphereHat tbh I am using my experience as an example, but I have pretty strong feelings about ppl who "don't wanna get involved" so
@BathysphereHat rofl talking like this makes it seem like she's voldemort.
seeing a typo after the fact 
so many layers of transphobia, of transmisogyny, racism, hatred of femininity, &amp; complete BULLSHIT idk where to start
what the fuck are other white women thinking when they try to come for laevern cox &amp; other amazing trans WoC for loving themselves?!
Ya'll think that "internet fame" gives people more legitimacy? Nah. Any sociopath can bullshit her way into powerful circles.
Ya'll make me so fucking tired. All this talk about listening to &amp; respecting victims goes out the window when the abuser has 1k+ followers.
I'm just here trying to have a nice day off &amp; now all I can think about is the shit I have to tolerate within this hypocritical community.
She is an abuser. And if you claim to fight for social justice without calling-out/denouncing abusers within our space, you're a hypocrite.
Anyone who has anything to do with @jetta_rae needs to stay the fuck away from me.
@7pee5 mic drop.

&lt;3
@BathysphereHat and I believe it's incredibly important to know whether or not the person you follow/amplify is an abuser.
@BathysphereHat pretty goddamn cut and dry and SHOCKINGLY social justice ppl STILL don't give a fuck about victims.
@BathysphereHat in my case she's an "internet famous" social justice person who fuckin ADMITTED TO IT &amp; ppl still took her side
@GlitteryAnimal it's so sweet and flopsy &lt;3
@GlitteryAnimal do you like bunnies? 
Hey thanks for doing what you're doing yall; you're making the world safer for all of us :) @ashleyjudd @femfreq @KamalaHarris @emilybazelon
Oh my gosh I am blocking 11k people, haha

I &lt;3 @blocktogether 
...&amp; being queer doesn't mean you can use every queer slur. If a gay man called me a d*ke I'd FLIP OUT on him
ya'll if you're talking about slurs, just say what kinda slurs they are, WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT

if it doesn't apply to you DON'T SAY IT.
watching the anti-troll livestream for #WITW  &amp; Anita starts listing insults..
Me: don't do it
Anita: fa****
Me: oh my god

c'mon WHY
I am so not jazzed about Age of Ultron now.

Definitely not doing the midnight thing...ugh, they're ruining Natasha's awesomeness ugh
@BathysphereHat there's nothing wrong with feeling this way at all. I know words don't always help, but I'm here for you. Hugs if wanted
@BathysphereHat I've spent a huge chunk of my life feeling guilty for not wanting sex. My only sexual experiences have been assault. :\
It's so much easier for me to think "it wasn't your fault" about other people than it is when I'm thinki…
@BathysphereHat may I RT this? all of it's really hitting home for me, but this tweet in particular..
@MCSerf you aren't subhuman, you're awesome. He's garbage &gt;:(

Yeah. This is what happens, when you have numerous white male …
@MCSerf that made me so upset too, I'm really sorry. He's a fucking gross ableist jackass &gt;:(

@SputnikStory I'm so sorry :(

are you getting the proper care you need now?
@SputnikStory thank you! so did I...this hashtag is super important and I hope it helps folks. we gotta know we aren't alone &lt;3
@Aleks_S "cured" isn't really a thing...we take it day by day. you're really awesome, I'm so glad you're making progress :)
When a huge part of your despair involves people not believing you having someone who cares &amp; believes you matters #DepressionAwarenessWeek
...also, big shoutout to my therapist for being the reason I can deal with this shit now.
I just wanna say it took a fucking lot for me to publicly post that I've been suicidal. A fucking LOT. S/O to my friends for supporting me.
Shoutout to my ex for being both the inspiration for my first suicidal feelings, AND the final straw that led to me finally seeking therapy.
Then as I got older it was paused to make room for horrific constant panic attacks &amp; anxiety. These days it's BACK &amp; worse than ever!
Oh hey it is #DepressionAwarenessWeek! I've had depression since I was a child; back then it was sleeping 16 hours a day &amp; skipping school
@Aleks_S do ittttt

it can help
KATIE, DON'T PUT ANYTHING IN THE "TO" SECTION UNTIL YOU'VE FINISHED TYPING, YOU LEAN TOO HARD ON THE KEYBOARD &amp; PRESS BUTTONS
accidentally sending an email before it's completed, to your professor 
my cat opened my door and ran up to me RIGHT as the oven beeped

she is very concerned about my late-night cooking
@littlelull that is so goddamn cowardly, "not getting involved." Ugh I've been there too. Ppl just wanna pretend shit isn't happening...
I will do everything I can to achieve that goal.
I never ever EVER want anyone in this world to experience what I have. I want everyone to feel safe &amp; loved &amp; happy.
I know that right now I have to prioritize my own mental health in order to feel strong enough to fight, but my life's goal is to PROTECT.
I want to make it perfectly clear that my ultimate goal in life is to protect people from abusers, predators, and generally awful people.
@littlelull I know how you feel. I've signed it, I'll do whatever I can to help.
@littlelull this is horrific. do you want me to RT this? D:

also, hugs if wanted. I'm a SA survivor too, anytime you wanna talk, I'm here
@Tsaiberia allowances should be made for asses AND pockets.

this I have decreed. may it be so.
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR ME TO FIND CLOTHES THAT FIT ME

She just walked up &amp; complimented my shoes &amp; we were friends for like 5 minutes until she hailed a cab, shook my hand, &amp; disappeared
When I bought my badass floral docs a random woman walked up to me @ the bus stop &amp; we commiserated over plus-size clothes being BS
Me: I wonder if she has heterochromia, like me
Bff: Only thing hetero about you!
Me: AHH
Bff: Hiyo!!
@cypheroftyr tired as hell &amp; procrastinating all my work, ha
@MCSerf sometimes sleep is the only thing that helps. I hope you feel better
@MCSerf Thank you :)

I hope you get all the things you want to. Are you feeling any better?
@MCSerf ..or maybe a hedge witch, I haven't decided.
@MCSerf my super secret dream is getting a small castle in Ireland with a bit of land &amp; retiring to be a disney princess, haha
@MCSerf aw I love both. I love taking care of them, chilling with them, riding them. I've had scary moments with them but I still love them
@MCSerf I want chickens so bad. I want chickens and goats and a horse. That's a big dream of mine.
@MCSerf you grew up on a farm. I am so jealous. Sometimes in Ireland I would get to let my cousin's chickens out of their coop, haha
@MCSerf do you live on a farm

this sounds magical
@mo_ranyart we are the best cuties :D
@MCSerf foxes seem to be doing ok too!
@MCSerf YOU HAVE A BABY GOAT?!!!!!

oh my god
@GlitteryAnimal @xyfemme 
@MCSerf yeah. sometimes I see coyotes! and raccoons. raccoons are crafty vicious little trash-eating jerks, I love them.
@MCSerf aw lil baby &lt;3

I miss being able to see wildlife on a regular basis :(
@MCSerf I had to google that, it's a dinosaur pangolin!! &lt;3

why you gotta one-up me with dinosaurs, nothing wins over dinosaurs, haha
look at this friggin cutie

I AM THIS CUTIE 
@MCSerf IT'S MY DREAM COME TRUE!


I'm a pangolin! 

:O
:D!!!!!!
@MCSerf maybe taking a break for yourself would help. I have to do that a lot :(
@sparklebutch nooo! Emergen-c and water? And...praying to something?
@galactwee adulthood :(
@MCSerf oh no I'm so sorry! :(

@xoxogossipgita we literally have a support group of ppl who were hurt by her.
@xoxogossipgita Jetta Rae. She is an emotionally manipulative sociopath who uses social justice to gain power over others. Bad times.
LRT: massive trigger warnings for rape, abuse, sexual assault. Yikes.
@xoxogossipgita I find you frustrating cause you're RTed into my feed saying stuff I agree with, yet you follow my serial-abuser ex. <CONFUSED FACE>
Making my morning commute so much better. I hid this last night to give myself a smile today. Oh, past Katie <THUMBS UP SIGN><REVOLVING HEARTS> 
I found the donut that I hid &amp; forgot about yesterday so today is going super well so far!!! Surprise donuts are the best donuts <DOUGHNUT>
@Aleks_S yeah that's how I deal too :)

soooo many cartoons, haha
@rivenhomewood haha, the best advice, thanks :)
@TheQuinnspiracy ..&amp; it's ok to take a break &amp; step back for yourself, cause people will help &amp; continue fighting always. :)
God I am so tired. I feel like I barely do anything but live, and I'm so tired. It's so hard to be positive, how do people do it?
@TheQuinnspiracy ..&amp; realize that there's always going to be a legion of assholes in this world, but there will also always be ppl who fight
@TheQuinnspiracy But I'd suggest, to your friend, that they think about all they've overcome, &amp; look @ the ppl who care &amp; support them daily
@TheQuinnspiracy I'm not sure if it's possible to stop giving a shit, especially when you're a thoughtful &amp; empathetic human being.
LRT: oh my god
@XOMeDeadly anyone who did that shit with me better be ready for me to set them on fire

seriously I will just turn the fuck into a dragon
@BathysphereHat wait until the daylight &amp; right under the window works well for me &lt;3

@ArchivistGeek hi so @CrashOverrideNW got back to me &amp; said they're willing to talk to you about this, but you have to message them directly
Talking to my friend about my ex &amp; she goes "wow it's ironic that someone involved in social justice is abusive"
Me: "Yeah. Go figure."

@ArchivistGeek @CrashOverrideNW the work you're doing is important and everyone should value it. Let's make noise NOW
@The_TimelessOne @ArchivistGeek @CrashOverrideNW yes, they do. so we gotta make some noise. make them give a shit.
@ArchivistGeek @CrashOverrideNW you matter. contact them again, take screenshots, show them this awfulness. They're supposed to help.
@ArchivistGeek @CrashOverrideNW yikes. they said that?
@ArchivistGeek have you contacted @CrashOverrideNW about this?
@ArchivistGeek you gotta get in with the "elite" social justice people. believe me, it isn't all about bright hair :\
just gonna leave this here...

@BathysphereHat aw I liked Muiri. this playthrough I killed the entire dark brotherhood immediately, though. yikes
ideal skyrim family: illia as my steward, rayya as housecarl, sonir as bard, 2 daughters (1 being Lucia), &amp; Aranea Ienith as my wife :(
if the bard for the lakehouse in skyrim was a woman, I'd have a big house full of ladies &amp; that's all I ever wanted. alas :(
@BathysphereHat my houses are rad as hell, I LOVE the greenhouse. it fills my house with bees &lt;3
@BathysphereHat yesssssss I saved two little girls from the street &amp; my wife is ysolda, but she's all bugged &amp; creepy now D:
@BathysphereHat I don't have a whole lot of patience for alchemy, but I use poisons constantly &amp; my sneaking is maxxed, haha &lt;3
@BathysphereHat WHAAAT that armor is amazing!! I can't add shit cause I play on xbox :(
oh gosh imagine an elder scrolls game where 95% of the npcs are redguards &amp; there are journey-esque sand sequences oh gosh
seriously can we have a hammerfell-centered game now, @Bethblog? I want to play a game that isn't white as hel
@BathysphereHat OH GOSH. I'm playing an awesome Redguard right now, she's huge &amp; heavily armored &amp; hates being touched so I use bows :P
@BathysphereHat wait you like skyrim? oh my gosh, do you wanna talk about skyrim?!
being a naturally sarcastic person, I've gotten into the habit of trying to indicate that I'm joking. but now I do it even when I shouldn't.
god damn it I need to stop overusing "haha," I know I do that to soften literally EVERYTHING I SAY. It's hard to stop.
haha I told my bff about the yummy brunch I made today &amp; she goes "are you trying to entice me?" YES. Love me, &amp; I will cook for you &lt;3
not surprising at all. buncha fuckers &gt;:( 
@mo_ranyart "ambient airborne batter" sounds like a band name
@littlelull orphan black is back tonight!!
@xyfemme yes, even that. You can do this
@xyfemme you're awesome &amp; you can do anything!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><REVOLVING HEARTS>
@BathysphereHat so cute! <REVOLVING HEARTS>
It's Saturday morning &amp; I don't work, which means I'm lying in bed thinking about a Hammerfell-centered Elder Scrolls game <REVOLVING HEARTS>
@Aleks_S yeah same. it's crap, I'm sorry. if I can get to sleep I can usually get up when I wake up... 
pro tip: if you're having a crappy day &amp; you're all sad, a video chat with @xyfemme helps A LOT cause she's a sweetie who inspires smiles &lt;3
@onthevraydar I'm glad your puppy is ok!
pysch I'm gonna stay home &amp; be really panicked for some reason

FRIDAY NIGHT YEAH
going to a bar tonight. I'll be the sleepy girl in the corner who smells like icy-hot patches. ladiessssss... 
On fridays I make fancy sandwiches
Rosemary chicken, bacon, sauteed spinach, heirloom tomatoes, &amp; garlic aioli, all on toasted peasant bread aw yiss 
me making a sandwich right now 


@Aleks_S happy birth-month!
stop calling black women sassy
stop calling black women sassy
stop calling black women sas…
Pedestals hurt. Hyping up the most visible members of the social justice community also puts them in more danger. Be respectful, not creepy.
Idk if this is because I'm a medievalist or what but I hear all this "saint" crap &amp; see ppl put HALOES on pics of her &amp; I just. Y'all. Chill
I was just like "uh ok so?" GGers think social justice is all about a cult of personality &amp; we are KINDA REINFORCING THAT MISCONCEPTION
It reminds me of my GGer brother &amp; how he would drag every goddamn rant @ me back to Anita &amp; Zoe &amp; tell me that they "don't care about" me
Almost read Anita's Cosmo article, then I saw they called her a "patron saint" &amp; now I'm just mad about these GODDAMN PEDESTALS
@mo_ranyart LOVE IT <REVOLVING HEARTS>
My printing professor mentioned that ppl picket outside of the bohemian club. I said "awesome" &amp; he said "yes I thought of you," ha HE KNOWS
I maintained a polite level of shutting her the fuck down. Seriously, where's my medal.

She's defending rich white male exclusive clubs wtf
"That moneys got to go somewhere! And they shouldn't HAVE to donate..."

Oh my god you awful little shit go tell someone who cares
I deserve a medal for not going off on the rich girl in my printing class

She just made a passionate defense of the super wealthy hoarding
@GlitteryAnimal you can do it! You got this
Wait there's only two weeks of school left? Shit, I should probably finish my thesis. And write my other paper. &amp; study for my final. FUCK

@Finickii that's fucking terrible, I hate this country's for-profit healthcare bullshit &gt;:(
@cypheroftyr journey and flower are two of my favorite games ever, but I don't have a PlayStation :(
@cypheroftyr ...were you talking to me too, here? Haha
Been chatting w/ a lot of strangers lately. Yesterday it was a lady at the bus stop commiserating over clothes, now it's on Bart re: hair
Woke up to ppl I like making friends on twitter, hell yeah

I should do follow Friday more often :)

@conlan_webster you too! :D
...now I'm home &amp; I'm getting to bed at a good time so I can get up early &amp; be responsible for another week, but I'm proud of my day off &lt;3
my nails look cute as hell, I maintained a nice buzz &amp; was super chill today, had fun at the game, a nice walk along the bay, &amp; good chats!
Credit: J. Fletcher 
@conlan_webster for tumblr, I follow almost 400 people, lol. so for starters, I'd suggest clandesteen, takingbackourculture, &amp; seananmcguire
@conlan_webster I'd recommend following @XOMeDeadly, @Aleks_S, @cypheroftyr, @BlkGirlManifest, @beckysaysrawr, &amp; @the_author_ for starters
@littlelull pffffft

they're overrated! :D
@littlelull step 1: put on the crop top
Step 2: wonder woman pose
Step 3: congrats you look rad!!
@galactwee I think you're right, I just worry :/
A guy was passed out on the grass outside the stadium. He moved, &amp; shook his head when I asked if he needed help, but I wish he'd spoken :(
@conlan_webster oh gosh I'll have to compile a list when I get home, haha
@conlan_webster tumblr is work, ha. Took me years to follow the right combo of ppl to balance horrific news with cute pics &amp; interior design
@conlan_webster aw ditto! Twitter can be terrifying, but also super educational. Between here &amp; tumblr I've learned so much
@conlan_webster wow that is super intense. Did you find them?
@conlan_webster HUGS!
@conlan_webster oh no :( it was part of the shame spiral that drove me to research &amp; teach myself about social justice
@littlelull oh gosh ty <FLUSHED FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><REVOLVING HEARTS>
@conlan_webster yeah I was an awful little shit as a teenager, making personal comments. I think I made a teacher cry once :(
@conlan_webster it really does. People suck. They just project their own insecurities
If I've learned anything about baseball tonight, it's that San Francisco loves Buster Posey
My continuing attendance at this game relies heavily on how slowly I can drink this beer.

I'm using a straw, cause I'm a classy lady.
@Aleks_S I'm good! Getting tipsy at a baseball game, got over some earlier anxiety through self-care. Feeling relieved, haha
The fog's sneaking in to ruin the party. Classic San Francisco, amirite? Haha oh 
@Aleks_S you doing ok?
@conlan_webster I just don't get WHY. I hope your wife is doing ok with it...this stuff can hurt :(
Now I don't give a single fuck about my eyebrows or dark circles. Y'all, stop making comments about people's bodies, it sticks with us.
And now it cracks me up how strong, thick brows are "in" &amp; folks are drawing them on their faces. I could've used that as a teen.
...yeah, cue 6 years of waxing &amp; self-conscious about my eyebrows.

They're thick. I have hair on my body. Fuckin deal with it
Also, I had never given my eyebrows a second thought until a girl in my first WoW guild told me I'd be pretty if I "fixed them"
My whole family, especially my mother, has always brought attention to the permanent dark circles under my eyes.
I feel like sharing something about my selfies. I don't take a lot of them. I like how I look, but various ppl have given me complexes
As soon as the sun goes down in SF, the free hat comes out. I like it! 
@BlkGirlManifest you're very brave. Thank you for sharing this story, and your picture. You're a cutie!! :)
@GlitteryAnimal you're a fuckin winner!
@conlan_webster women's curling? That's fucking rad!
@Tsaiberia I'll bet! I've never had that experience. I'm always just managing people &amp; trying to keep it all moving
@Tsaiberia haha, yeeeeah

No comment, ha
@Tsaiberia I hope it's going well!!
the lighting on that hot dog is FUCKING PHENOMENAL

I have never taken a better picture.
It's not a baseball game without a hot dog y'all

..and yes, I am in the nosebleed section, haha 
I'm drinking bourbon &amp; the stadium smells like meat, &amp; they're playing country

...I feel like I'm back in Arkansas. But in a nice way, haha
I feel fake cause I don't follow sports, but I really do enjoy live games, haha

LET'S ALL GET EXCITED YAAAY seriously it's fun
AMERICA!

Fuck yeah, band geeks! I wasn't one of you, but I hung out with y'all cause you were cool
We were on the bus with the person whose grandkid is performing the star spangled banner

Fun fact
I have bourbon. Let's fuckin do this
Oh god I'm live-tweeting a baseball game. This is happening
...aaand out come the bagpipes.
AWWW they have wee Irish dancers!!! It's Irish heritage night, which is why we were given these tickets, haha
@MCSerf oh god. Can you email them?
It's creepy how crowded &amp;...mall-like At&amp;t stadium is, but the view is pretty fucking great
I'M HERE. MY TICKETS WERE FREE. AND I AM READY TO tolerate this sports game, hell yeah! 
@galactwee me too!! I found them in crossroads...you and I should go thrifting! :D
@mo_ranyart oh my gosh that sounds amazing. will you post pics?
I have treated myself today. And it was good. 
@mo_ranyart thank youuu! I love it! it's gel :3

what color are you using?
My nails are purple &amp; glittery &amp; my nail tech massaged my hands &amp; I found these docs for half off so FUCK YEAH <NAIL POLISH><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><REVOLVING HEARTS> 
@Aleks_S I like the way you think <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I promised myself if I did my thesis draft, and did well on it, I'd buy myself a manicure. I'm getting it today I AM SO STOKED
*cackles* 
@MCSerf I don't like jj abrams so I was like "oh great it's getting the star trek treatment..."

BUT NOW I'M TRYING NOT TO CRY &amp; FAILING

Today: aaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
@MCSerf I just

I just wouldn't let myself have any hope, I was all bitter about it

&amp; now my inner fangirl CANNOT BE CONTAINED
@MCSerf GEEK OUT WITH ME HOLY SHIT I'M DYING

I BOUGHT MY BROTHERS &amp; ME MATCHING "NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS" SHIRTS
*cries* *falls on the ground*

*cries some more*

OH GOD IT'S BEAUTIFUL 
@galactwee 
@galactwee anytime you want! Haha
Taking advantage of my day off by making an awesome vegetarian breakfast: eggs, zucchini, spinach, peppers aw yiss &lt;3 


The purple in my hair really brings out the dark circles under my eyes

This is a good look <PURPLE HEART><THUMBS UP SIGN>
*Diverse cast, massive profits from divers audience*
"NOT THAT MARKET! OMG!"

"SJW …
yes good this was the right choice 
I was gonna go to bed but then I got really upset at how terrible the world is, so I'm watching Over the Garden Wall instead.
it's the only source of frustration in my life where I can do that; feel like it gives me back a little bit of power &lt;3
something I like about video games is that if I'm getting frustrated with it, I can just TURN THE DAMN THING OFF &amp; go do something better.
@Tsaiberia self care should be a priority, it's super important. you deserve a break :)
@BathysphereHat I drink stuff in bottles in the shower...less diluted that way, ha
@rupazero I had this issue in Skyrim. Couldn't kill them, I'd just run away. Then they started acting like rude lil shits &amp; I was like FINE
@cypheroftyr it took me forever to get used to the controls, I usually hate first person games. I'm only now getting good a year later haha
@cypheroftyr I'm thinking some cider &amp; Skyrim. A bath would be so nice, wish my bathroom was clean, ha
@7pee5 I've walked out of classes because I fuckin refuse to do that anymore.
@BathysphereHat it always made me mad how hard they all leaned on history of magic being "boring." I'd go full Hermione in that class

Also, remember to eat + drink water + take your meds (if you have any)!
&lt;3
@orlikeawhale yeah I didn't used to immediately check the author first. Cause it's also abuser-enablers that I can't fuckin stand
@GidgetNomates YES.
I CANT SUPPORT A MOVEMENT ENOUGH 
Ugh I spend so much time on campus just wistfully staring into space 

What I want is to wistfully stare into space AT HOME
@BathysphereHat yay you! Also omg I have those glasses in blue
Yikes even when I'm participating in a friendly critique of a classmate I like, as soon as feminist issues pop up I go into FIGHT MODE
@galactwee KILL IT KILL IT
LRT: this article is SUPER IMPORTANT!!
@galactwee dang it

ok so wear less makeup, tf does that have to do with me
@galactwee that's what would get me to play it, since I don't like turn based :/
the saddest thing: my cat meowing at me cause I'm all wrapped up in a blanket &amp; she wants in on that action, but I gotta get dressed :(


wow I just threw up in my mouth a lil bit
「Kawaiiお菓子ギフト 1/12」※画像2枚 
speaking of dirty laundry I really gotta go do mine, I have legit run out of underwear. this is a problem.
I miss being able to retweet shit, without having to do all this fuckin research every step of the goddamn way. I miss feeling comfortable
Ya'll are talking about calling ppl out &amp; trying to make this community a safe space WHILE YOU'RE FOLLOWING A KNOWN ABUSER lol ok
I am not dirty laundry. My experiences are not dirty laundry. MY FEELINGS ARE FUCKING VALID. NOT FUCKING DIRTY LAUNDRY.
I've blocked so many ppl for publicly supporting her &amp; saying my call-out of her is "drama" or "dirty laundry"
but the block feature is garbage &amp; the last thing I need in my life is someone RTing her into my feed

ughhh
the worst thing in the world is having to check to make sure ppl I start following aren't also following my shitty ex. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.
@XOMeDeadly aw I'm sorry :(

sometimes the only thing that helps me is stepping back from twitter &amp; watching a bunch of baby animal videos
@littlelull thats really scary, I'm sorry! I really hope they figure out the issue so you can get back to your life :(
@XOMeDeadly I should ask her to help me with my student loan...maybe that wouldn't be a valuable learning experience for me, tho

"@emitans: oh my god 

when I was in kindergarten I got an entire class of peers to pretend …
@onthevraydar @XOMeDeadly it is. This is something we all need to talk about or these activist/social justice spaces will NEVER be safe

Distancing and belittling women because you think your gender is inferior. 
@BathysphereHat youtube instructional videos? haha, idk I'd get all sweaty and ask a friend to take responsibility for it
@BathysphereHat wow that shit is hard! I complain about cutting my own BANGS, ha

I have an awesome friend who dyes it for me tho
@BathysphereHat gonna add that to the list! every time I get something new I spend forever trying to make sure it's my hair's shade, ha
@BathysphereHat aw ty! yeah it's got a lot more purple in it now

I really love your color/cut, it's brilliant
@BathysphereHat I'm very slowly getting into makeup, I haven't found a lipstick that I really love yet, but this lip tint is brilliant &lt;3
@BathysphereHat I use Atomic Pink by Special Effects :D

My lipstick is 
@BlkGirlManifest wow. just wow. &gt;:(
@onthevraydar @XOMeDeadly oh fuck that. nuh uh. doing one good thing doesn't mean you can't be challenged and corrected when you fuck up.
@onthevraydar @XOMeDeadly ugh that's terrible, I'm so sorry :(
@XOMeDeadly yes absolutely, sorry about the wait, haha

and thank you for asking :)
@XOMeDeadly &amp; any criticism of feminists with more than 1000 followers means we're hurting the movement? Lol come on
@XOMeDeadly its horrifying. Seeing people who accurately identify &amp; fight against abuse when cis white dudes do it, but protect sjw abusers
@dreamachineries I'm sorry :(
@XOMeDeadly be very very quiet, apparently. <UNAMUSED FACE>

The best victims are the quiet victims! We wouldn't want to upset our abusers now...
@gabesmed I'm interested! :)
@littlelull you can do it!!! 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE I HAVE A DAY OFF TOMORROW

so I'm gonna drink this whiskey &amp; listen to the new @JanelleMonae &amp; love my life
I love this exploration of sexuality &amp; shit

turns out I'm an ace of diamonds hell yeah 
ok you fuckers can you fucking STOP CALLING A FUCKING DRINK AN "IRISH CAR BOMB" SERIOUSLY STOP IT

what the fuck is WRONG WITH YA'LL ughhh
@GlitteryAnimal 
@XOMeDeadly it's truuuue

gotta hang onto that internet fame at the expense of other marginalized people, right?
"Don't subtweet me"
"U know what? Don't criticize me at all, just fall in line"

- Our feminist role models ap…
oh my gosh there are ppl who make twitters just to respond to ppl having a tough time with empathy &amp; support aww 
as time passes my priorities are getting weirder &amp; weirder.

a couple months ago: STOP BEING DEPRESSED
now: GET A MANICURE

Idk I like it.
Ok but I just wanna get my nails done. I've been doing my nails &amp; wrecking them up &amp; they look like trash. I blame work &amp; school UGH.
@littlelull you're a champion! 
@littlelull it happens! and it's ok. you got through it! :)
@littlelull I'm sorry, wanna talk about it? :( 

HAVE ANOTHER 
@7pee5 wait what
so fucking sick of it
@MCSerf had to do that with my brothers too.
@whydoisay my friend sent me something months ago &amp; no one knows what happened to it. Ugh
@EmilyRFB @gutterglitters @FemHype aw ty! I'm glad we're not alone with those experiences. My next stuff will focus on the positives, lol
@littlelull LET'S DO THIS 
In case y'all missed it, I wrote my 1st article for @FemHype about my experience as a gamer/survivor! <SPARKLING HEART>
@EmilyRFB nice! I love those soundtracks, I'll add them to my list :D

Laverne Cox is one of the rare people in this world who I look at &amp; feel like, just for a second, everything's gonna be ok.
Who the fuck would fuck with Laverne Cox though. She's like...the real life Rose Quartz, we are all in love with her cause she's wonderful.
@Aleks_S it is. I wish you didn't have to experience it.
NO I haven't fucking heard of x, I've been too busy avoiding gamer spaces cause they aren't fucking safe for me. Guess I'm a fake geek girl!
@GlitteryAnimal your hair looks great, did you re-dye?
Worst part of getting back into games is how many freaking games there ARE

it's overwhelming &amp; ppl are like "wait you haven't heard of x?!"
I would pick Bernie Sanders over Hillary in a heartbeat. I am so not jazzed about the coming election season. Ughh

Rando with guy: HEY we're having a fight; is your hair pink?
Me: pink &amp; purple
Rando: haha YES. He thinks its red cause he's drunk. Bye!

hey I got compliments on my technique from the ladies though so WORTH IT

gonna need a permit for these guns *flex*
My entire body aches from hulking out on the printing press Friday...

This is what I get for showing those bros how tough I am, haha
dang I am so behind on Elementary
And it almost convinced me that I'm not one, …
@xyfemme do you want to talk about it and/or hang out, or do you need space? cause if you don't think it's annoying I'd love to text more
@MCSerf A+ ty for the compliment, haha
@MCSerf yeah well. I've been fucked over by "internet-famous" social justice ppl before &amp; let me tell you, keep your expectations low.
@MCSerf people being jerks basically.

this is why I don't follow many "big-name" ppl, lol
@GlitteryAnimal tbh I don't even know how ya'll haven't blocked anyone who rts or communicates with her.
Don't believe them when they say they aren't.
If twitter had the same "who has viewed your page" option that okcupid has, I'd have deleted this shit years ago
@GlitteryAnimal exhibit B is that people I don't want to see me can still see me &amp; I CAN SEE THEM CHECKING MY PAGE ughhh
@GlitteryAnimal exhibit A for why I deleted my okcupid account D:
@GlitteryAnimal haha, gross.
@XOMeDeadly I just wanted to let you know I support you. Your words &amp; expressions are yours to control &amp; her response to that was terrible.
When we lift these people up into positions of power, we are also responsible for letting that power go unchecked. CALL OUT YOUR HEROES.
"oh, x does wonderful things for x group" or "x was so nice to me!!" doesn't mean that person isn't doing terrible things to other people.
My issues with people start when their actions become patterned and abusive. Unfortunately that's easily hidden within the SJW community.
Respect people for the work they do to fight for equality, but don't automatically assume that they're flawless individuals. We all fuck up.
GET THESE FUCKING E-CELEB SOCIAL JUSTICE PEOPLE OFF THESE PEDESTALS, THEY WILL ONLY DISAPPOINT
It's as if we're all human, &amp; doing one good thing doesn't make us good people. Just like doing one bad thing doesn't make us bad people.
Yikes.

Every time a popular sjw "celeb" does something fucked up, I just mutter "yup" into my glass as I sip bitterly.
Not ever.
@GlitteryAnimal also I think it's amazing how in touch you are with your emotions &amp; how honest you are with how you express them
@GlitteryAnimal something I didn't tell you when we met: I love your voice. It's really beautiful..talking to you was extra nice cause of it
#explainyourusername there's no glitter in the gutter, there's no twilight galaxy 
@GlitteryAnimal I'm sorry :( is there anything I can do to help?
A coworker asked me what I'm going to do after college...

Me: idk, probably cry a lot?
Them: *nods sagely*
@Aleks_S all valid choices
...but then I GREW THE FUCK UP &amp; stopped trying to silence other people in order to reassure myself that my shitty behavior was ok.
@FemHype absolutely. it just exists to silence.
The worst part is I know that teenage me would've said the same thing, only meaner.
Yikes that person was so quick to be like "well I had a good mmo experience! &gt;:(" &amp; I wanna be like CONGRATS YAY FOR YOU I didn't? Haha
lol at no point did I say my experience was UNIVERSAL. This is literally a piece about my personal experiences within gaming communities.
My mom posted my article (w/out saying I'm her kid). One of her friends responded with "well that's just her opinion" &amp; I'm like "Uh, yeah?"
@jennyslate @gabeliedman that's the ideal, wow
I almost clicked on an article link in my feed cause they said it was a "good read" before I realized it's MY article &amp; now I'm blushing <FLUSHED FACE><KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>

@femfreq YES. In every way. 

I've had fights with people over this, haha

@littlelull I'm so sorry :(

For something positive, here's my cat yawning &amp; showing her lil buck-fang! 
Showed the bartender my thesis research &amp; now he's telling me food history from Spain! :D
oh my god my scholarly resource on troubadours just used the word "misandry" unironically. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
..but it's nice to see ppl fighting for "yes means yes" instead of some "the opposite of consent isn't necesarrily non-consent" bullshit
Gonna excuse myself from this SA conversation for my own mental health...
ugh this shit never ends. it never will. people put their selfish desires before other peoples' comfort &amp; rights ALL THE TIME.
LRT: yeah cishet dudes may be the most powerful perps, but they aren't the only ones pushing back against consent
@galactwee ah that was my issue. there is a weird flu going around, it might be that. Try a hot shower, that helped me a lot.
@galactwee is it the same respiratory crap?
@MCSerf she does! she's super smart. but she's not as sweet and kind as him. she looks at him funny a lot, he's so naive, haha.
@galactwee ugh, is it that fucking house? there is something in that house. SPORES &gt;:(
@MCSerf alternately, it may be why he's still so sweet &amp; full of imagination; lord knows school tried to beat that out of ME
@MCSerf yeah they probably argued that they were more equipped to educate him. unfortunately, they didn't bother with any human education
@MCSerf yeah there's an episode where they address him not going to school. They don't say how he gets a pass though, haha
@littlelull that sounds terrifying, I really hope you get better! :(

@harikondabolu just make the cd, tell them it's ironic. young people love irony.
I told my best friend I hadn't gotten enough work done today, and she just said "oh katie :("

THE SHAME WORKS, I AM WRITING WITH GUSTO
oh my gosh I just roasted the most AMAZING asparagus with garlic &amp; rosemary &amp; salt

...instead of writing my thesis, but still
@FerretParty I think Natasha...THINKS she's going into attack mode, haha. It's not very effective
@FerretParty my cat loves when pigeons land on our windowsill; she goes all still, presses her nose to the glass, and CHIRPS at them
I overuse quotation marks and semicolons

#editorialobservationoftheday
#IOnceDatedSomeoneWho I didn't actually know I was dating. This has happened multiple times. I thought we were just hanging out!
@sparklebutch oh goshhhh. there are a lot of these jerks out there! D:
#IOnceDatedSomeoneWho didn't tell me until the date was almost done that he was about 15 yrs older than me. I was a teenager, ick
#IOnceDatedSomeoneWho thinks gay couples shouldn't hold hands cause it's "bad for kids" to see that. HE'S GAY. I'M GAY. Yikes.
@MCSerf that's why it's so important for ya'll to speak up. because patriarchy, ppl actually listen to you instead of shouting you down.
I don't wanna hear your bullshit hurtful "opinions" on my existence. I'm not gonna hold your hand while you try to decide if I'm a person.
The "silencing" of bigotry &amp; hatefulness IS NOT A BAD THING. Making "safe spaces" for bigots means taking those spaces from the marginalized
"we wanna make sure everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts, even on such controversial topics as gay marriage!" NOPE.
Reminds me of the "social justice" class I dropped at my school, where they said in order to make a safe space for ALL, bigotry was allowed.
Most importantly, equating exposing racists &amp; other bigots, with the doxxing of marginalized ppl by THOSE SAME BIGOTS is fucked up.
Fighting back against abuse doesn't make you "as bad as your abuser," whether it's a personal relationship or internet harassment.
I believe 100% in naming your abusers. Even in my own personal experience, however, I've never EVER considered posting their addresses tho.
Lotta people talking about this "doxxing for sj" article. This is one hell of a conversation that needs to be had. I'm pretty conflicted.
@NotAllBhas this is horrifying, I am so sorry
@galactwee there is a very clear divide between rich and poor queer folk in there. there's like...hugely upper class castro ppl :\
BATMAN: ...
ROBIN: Just kidding, let's go…
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your fee…
I left a piece of chocolate in my hoodie pocket &amp; it melted &amp; now I'm covered in chocolate

This is the opposite of a problem!
Sounds like my mother &amp; brother are estranged now.

I feel so sorry for my nephew...his rage is gonna fuck that baby up.
nah dude you're grown. we were helpless as kids but we are responsible for our own choices now. you are CHOOSING to be a dickhead
yikes it took him 8 minutes to turn that shit on her &amp; blame her for him being so angry &amp; misogynistic &amp;...generally shitty
aw jeez my brother just called my mom to yell at her over her feminist facebook posts haha

that guy is too much, ya'll
Monument Valley makes me smile <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> 
I'm doing research while I'm writing my thesis &amp; I'm slowly realizing that this argument is NOT gonna go where I want. Whoopsies! <BABY ANGEL>
My school has enough of my money, thanks.

I'm just gonna stop answering unknown calls. Ugh.
Hey college donation solicitors! Please let me politely leave the convo, don't drag it out &amp; repeat yourself &amp; make things awkward
I should be writing a 30 page argument on lesbians in the middle ages

instead I'm watching chocolate bunnies melt 
hey ya'll if you haven't gone to see "Home" GO SEE IT! IT IS FULL OF LOVE &amp; DIVERSITY &amp; SENTIMENTALITY &amp; SWEETNESS &amp; ANTI-IMPERIALISM
oh my gosh an asexual succubus &lt;3 
@GidgetNomates they were probably required to add something meaningful in order to in some sorta way fit into the SU narrative, haha
@GidgetNomates rofl oh jeez
@GidgetNomates pfffffft lol. too defensive. people shouldn't be expected to like ANY "crossover" episode.
@GidgetNomates I have to be pretty bored to watch regular show. I love adventure time still, though it can be hit or miss.
@GidgetNomates nah I think it's sweet but not particularly deep to be like "be yourself kids" literally every cartoon says that shit
@GidgetNomates oh well yeah, I don't fucking watch uncle grandpa, haha. i don't like most CN shows. just AT, SU, &amp; occasionally regular show
@GidgetNomates I liked it cause they started it out saying it wasn't canon, so I could just laugh at it
I just about lost my shit at "THAT'S NOT MY BABY" holy fuck

ok steven universe I like your crossover :D
@saladinahmed we need more EVERYTHING based on medieval manuscript illustrations
@conlan_webster aww cute!
ahhh I love it when he does that, haha

he asked me how I was when I walked in &amp; I paused for too long before I said "fine" so...he's nice
I've been craving gin &amp; tonic so I stopped at my local store for some &amp; the owner hid a piece of candy in my bag 
I really love to laugh. It's my favorite hobby.
It would be nice to be able to laugh &amp; enjoy some fucking jokes without "edgy" sexism/racism/transphobia just dropped right in there
haha, he's an anglophile &amp; tried to take the piss over me being northern irish catholic

Me: "you are on the THINNEST OF ICE"
he was very quiet. said he liked kristen &amp; hadnt heard of hari. I hope he looks him up &amp; stops laughing when I rant about racism/imperialism
I mean, I told him I liked @harikondabolu &amp; @kristenschaaled &amp; that I do fucking love comedy, but so much of it is just so heartless/cruel
and this is a guy who was flabbergasted when I explained that I don't listen to a lot of comedy because so much of it is abusive garbage
Bill Maher is fucking terrible.

I actually got a straight white british man to cringe &amp; say "yeah he sucks" today when I brought him up
@xyfemme it's ok to do that too.

I do that a lot, haha.

it feels weirdly like an indulgence. &amp; maybe it is. and that's ok.
@xyfemme my mom does that!

it's so frustrating. I'm so sorry :((
@xyfemme do it. this is your space :D
earlier: GONNA GO HOME &amp; WRITE MY THESIS
now: THERE IS A PArTY FULL OF WHITE PPL BLASTING AKON'S "FUCK YOU" &amp; SCREAM-LAUGHING NEXT DOOR
@littlelull omg &lt;3
Now I guess I can get back out there, fully prepared! OH THE WASTED YEARS.
@Tsaiberia ugh! I'm really glad y'all are OK though
The bar last night had this handy infographic on the wall on how to find true love. So mad it took me so long to see! 
@Tsaiberia are you OK? :(
Me: "Beef stew"
Russian computer: "Password not stroganoff"
@xyfemme I hope it goes OK!!
@Aleks_S it's tough when intellectually you know how you're feeling doesn't make sense...but it doesn't stop you feeling that way. Sorry :(
.@MCSerf instead of years of pain &amp; trauma, you just hang out eating leaves, then chill in a cocoon, then BAM! You're a terrifying butterfly
@MCSerf I would prefer this honestly
@MCSerf saaame haha
LRT: CACKLING
@galactwee well I just did
@dreamachineries N is for NO SURVIVORS...
@conlan_webster college has beaten my love of writing out of me. Now I procrastinate so bad that I give myself terrible anxiety. Ugh
@conlan_webster smart! I am not super tech-savvy, but I take good care of my electronics. They seem to be built to break though.
@conlan_webster aww. I shouldn't have time, I have a thesis to write, haha. But I have to relax &amp; these days that means phone games
A MYSTERY INDEED
Students at my school leave their expensive laptops unattended an awful lot. Are they naïve, trusting infants? Or too rich to care?
But everything is fine cause I got a B on my midterm. And B's get degrees!
My poor laptop can't even handle Gone Home for more than an hour anymore. It deteriorated so rapidly...
Sad sad lil nerd. Can't play video games. Just watches YouTube videos &amp; sighs wistfully.
There are so many games that I want to play...I even OWN some of them &amp; I can't play cause my tech is old/can't handle it :(
@whydoisay Austin &amp; Polk in SF. Please, take pictures of the puking! OH puke in a wine glass!
Book facts!!!
...which isn't actually priceless, it is about $500,000
Fridays mean it's time to get my grubby lil hands all over some priceless books.

Today's priceless book was the 1st ed. of Ulysses!
Just because you KNOW you're terrible DOESN'T MAKE IT OK TO BE TERRIBLE

you're still terrible &amp; now you don't even feel guilty about it
Seriously tired of "self-aware rich people" irony
Me facts: I will dutifully laugh at That Thing you're showing me on Facebook
Mom facts: all moms want to show you that funny thing they saw on Facebook

ALL MOMS

Like, my roommate is not my mom. But she is A mom
@littlelull nooo! I hope your immune system bucks up :(
Wait there's a wine bar in sf called "the pour house?!" 

...

what the fuck is WRONG WITH Y'ALL
@littlelull sickness never wants to let go, ugh
Tea in my wonder woman mug, fuck yeah I'm ready for this day! 
@dreamachineries renegades can be helpful!
@freebsdgirl that's horrific, I really hope you're alright :(

…
@rivenhomewood that's good advice, thanks :)
dreams for the future: being able to afford living alone

what a beautiful fantasy
@Aleks_S yup.but validation and affirmations are the best! &lt;3
@Aleks_S I've been gaslit constantly my whole life so I always doubt myself no matter what. It really fucks with you
@Aleks_S so many ppl have bad therapy experiences, we really did get lucky, haha. I'm glad you feel validated too :)
@Aleks_S I told her that &amp; she immediately just started stating "your feelings are valid &amp; your experiences matter" &amp; I felt so much better
@Aleks_S I'm getting better! Haha, I am awkwardly, slowly getting better. She validates my experiences really well, which I need.
@Aleks_S ah jeez lying to family, haha. I never used to lie to my mom. Now its all I do. You don't want them to know you're hurting
@Aleks_S I'm a terrible liar, so it doesn't even work that well. Ppl just think I'm being weird, or they don't care enough to investigate.
@littlelull aw ty. I don't know, talking about it helps. Thank you for the affirmation, I needed it &lt;3
@Aleks_S its awful. We make ourselves worse. The worse I am, I guarantee it, the less I'll talk about it. I just don't wanna bother anyone
.@Aleks_S &amp; I know that's wrong but I just get trapped in a cycle of guilt &amp; honestly I need all the support I can get. So I lie a lot.
.@Aleks_S that's why I get more quiet the more I'm depressed...I don't want ppl to be annoyed with me over this shit I can't change
I feel like a buzzkill just for fucking existing.

I spend way too much time apologizing to my therapist for SHARING MY FUCKING FEELINGS.
I already feel like everything I say is too negative. That I'm bumming out my friends by giving honest answers to "how are you"
Being followed by depression-centered accounts is fucking...upsetting
@MCSerf she's British
Lady next to me on the bus was BAD sick &amp; I was trying so hard not to just give up then &amp; there. You win, plague. Take me back
Guess who's back

Back again

Katie's back

Back in bed
Seriously today I was "moved" by a security guard because business people "DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME"
Rich people are too much.
I just got in trouble for sitting on the fucking ground. They called a security guard on me.
@Finickii you should play it, it's free. It's one of this reasons I finally called a therapist.
Letting tourists take pictures with me at work cause they like my hair is weirdly stressful. But most ppl don't ask me first so eh.
@MCSerf its also the fault of the long history of male developers that use stereotypical bullshit to denote a "female character"
This is a tragic story with an uplifting ending

CATS
I was gonna go to bed but I lost my balance &amp; fell on my back on the couch &amp; was too sad to get up &amp; then my cat took a nap on my tummy.
@mo_ranyart I'm so sorry you lost your work :( creativity is connected to mental health, I've been having trouble writing too..
I wish that I could say that there's no better place than home

But home is a place that I have never known
I don't care about what all the others say. Well I guess there are some things that will just never go away..
When I feel terrible, I watch Steven Universe.

It makes the world seem a little bit better &lt;3
I'm actually having trouble not crying right now. I wanted to say just how exhausted I am in every way but I couldn't. I am so tired.
After I made up my exam, my prof asked me if I'm feeling better, &amp; how I am in the rest of my life. I was so taken aback by someone caring.
Something I've noticed: when younger professors ask me how I'm doing, they ACTUALLY MEAN IT. They actually care. Such a nice change.
@mo_ranyart as AN EXPERIENCE
Feel sorry for the guy coughing up a lung near me while waiting for the bus. Also, 2 weeks of sick was enough, STAY AWAY FROM ME PLEASE.
@Tsaiberia OK I am very jealous
Shout out to my favorite bar for recognizing me as a regular &amp; treating me like a queen &lt;3
@marysyringart I am a professional friend-promoter, haha
@conlan_webster yeah...in their defense, it has a restaurant "section", but...its a bar. Haha
@conlan_webster like a toddler. They have removed it, lol.
This bar doesn't KNOW that I just came back from therapy, but maybe a "crisis hotline" episode focusing on suicide ISN'T THE BEST CHOICE.
Somebody brought a baby to the bar &amp; now that baby is crying.

This is the opposite of what I wanted.
@Tsaiberia at my place, boots, pants and some variety of sweater. My therapist tends to have more unique outfits :)
I think there's a certain fashion for therapy visits...since everyone in here is wearing a variation of the same thing.
Telling sad stories from my life 10 minutes before therapy starts.

Its like a warmup, haha
And now I don't trust anybody! Yaaaay
My ex thought it was hilarious. So did my now-bff. My schools administration, who hated me, apologized to me &amp; forgave my absence.
My brother's gf drove us to my house &amp; woke my brother up, who grumpily said it was a hoax &amp; went back to bed. We were thunderstruck.
Various friends &amp; teachers tried to console me. My brother's then-gf dragged me through the whole school &amp; everyone saw what a mess I was.
I was at school when this news hit me, &amp; I completely lost it. We called a friend who tearfully confirmed it, &amp; I broke down.
Story time! When I was in highschool my brother &amp; his friends "pranked" me by saying that my ex boyfriend had been murdered.
the hardest part about writing this little story about my relationship with gaming

is ending it on a positive note

that shit is HARD
since moving to the bay area &amp; befriending a bunch of vegans I've gotten a lot better with this sorta stuff though. I no longer hiss at tofu
@dreamachineries saaaaaame
when ppl offer me tofu &amp; soymilk &amp; fake burgers &amp; stuff like that I just flash right back to when that's all I was allowed to eat &gt;:(
my family has a lot of issues with "health food" due to my father using food to abuse us for a decade or so. we weren't allowed to eat much
she was so nervous I think she thought I'd throw it on the ground &amp; scream "HOW COULD YOU" haha
my mom &amp; her vegan roommate just made smoothies

mom handed me one with trepidation &amp; I tried it &amp; all apologetic she goes "it has soymilk"
@GlitteryAnimal that is very...2010-nerd-culture :\

@GlitteryAnimal aww reminds me of 
haha wow this video is really going through the whole game isn't it

I should probably...not watch this...until I've beaten the game...
LRT: I'm still only at 20% with Sword &amp; Sworcery. It kept bugging out and frustrating me. My phone does NOT like it. :\
Things that make me feel proud: 

My all-mushroom garden in Skyrim

How much my children like me in Skyrim

...SKYRIM
Now let's see what happens when I go to bed with no sleep aid whatsoever

I hope it's something MAGICAL

Oh gosh I'm so excited to not sleep
@rupazero different people have tried to sell this to me as something other than an abusive relationship but nope. even as a kid I hated it.
*eats some arugula &amp; listens to ambient music*

well there's my healthy stuff for the week done!

Breathe in thru the  nose as the belly fills up with air. Breathe out thru the mouth and miss me w…
@Aleks_S I'm sorry :(
@GlitteryAnimal I'm glad you got out of there! Hope you feel better
Home was so adorable! I loved it <THUMBS UP SIGN><REVOLVING HEARTS>

Sweet &amp; cute &amp; funny &amp; cheesy &amp; it made me cry. What more could I ask for in a movie :)
@ThtFlightyBroad its just really gross gatekeeping
@ThtFlightyBroad I've met several queer women who police like this. Think they're Queen of the Queers or something. It's really shitty &gt;:(
I'm the only person in this movie theater. And that's how I like it. &lt;3
...right after that I saw a cute cat walking on a leash &amp; felt a little better
"Yeah there's a girl in it so its probably pretty easy"

Random guy walking past me said this to his bro, it made me so fucking mad &gt;:(
Just noticed this on campus. I really like it, Cal, good job. A+ 
Me all morning: everything is terrible.

Me right now, drinking a peanut butter smoothie: things are becoming marginally less terrible.
LRT: YES. YES THIS IS FANTASTIC
*gestures towards massive student loan debt and a shitty car*
@xyfemme you have friends; that means you will never be homeless :)
@kendrawcandraw ....hey. You're gonna be ok. You don't have to prove yourself to anybody.
@FemHype it's one hell of a fight. we have a long way to go :(
I would really REALLY like a donut.

Just plain glazed.

It's the closest thing I have to a life goal atm.
There can't be true unity in a community that protects abusers. It's just a movement that prioritizes abusers and marginalizes victims.
To all victims of abuse: SPEAK YOUR TRUTH. I support you. Staying silent isn't "protecting the movement," it just protects abusers.
@riotheatherrr @boldandworthy @AdidiPonders A+ way to use social justice rhetoric to silence victims. Disgusting.
@Aleks_S haha YUP

if I were left to my own devices, this is my dream 
@xyfemme yeah me too.
Gosh my last tweets were very Debbie Downer, so here's a picture of a cute confused vole I found 
Now I see "inclusive" cons &amp; communities patting themselves on the back for creating "safe spaces" &amp; I just feel numb. Enjoy your fantasy.
Whether on a large or a small scale, we are, none of us, safe. AT ALL. These communities are filled with predators &amp; abusers.
Then I had an experience with a "big-name" in the SJW community that made me realize it's the same for all of us: there ARE no safe spaces.
At the time this stunned &amp; infuriated me; how the fuck could these people sleep at night, knowing that they'd taken away her safety.
It always reminds me of @GeekGirlCon, where at a panel @femfreq stated that there WERE no safe spaces for her. Only "safer" spaces.
Every once and awhile I'll see a post on my TL warning folks to be careful within ___ community, cause abusers lurk there.
there's a big problem with this article, &amp; it's number 3 on their list: they call gaslighting "crazy-making," which is BEYOND fucked up
kinda sad that the "thought of you" messages I get these days are so...dark.
My friend from work &amp; I talk a lot about our emotionally abusive exes; she sent me this article yesterday 
true friendship is editing someone's shit for free
Going over and over my piece on my experience growing up with games; my best friend &amp; I are arguing over sentence structure, haha
@galactwee ok good :)
@galactwee you alright? wanna talk about it?
@galactwee I'm usually like that too, that's what makes this so weird, haha

[takes off shoes]

Look out now I'm outta control

[gets in bed]

Woooooo

[tur…
@galactwee good luck!
@galactwee that movie did literally nothing for me. I could not form an emotional connection at ALL. I have no idea why...
I'm on a roll &amp; I am PUMPED!

GONNA GO CLEAN OUT THE FRIDGE

FUCK YEAH
cleaning my room feels like the final stage in this illness

OUT WITH THE GROSS, IN WITH THE CLEAN
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ동영상도 있네욬ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

finding so many stickers while I'm cleaning my room

THIS IS A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION! yaaay stickers!
CAT. #cat #CatsOfTwitter 
Looking at my photos from my last family trip to Ireland &amp; wishing this semester was over already. I wanna talk to sheep &amp; nap in fields
@lurkeriatipsos sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who didn't like frozen
@_AlexHirsch you're delightful.
@sparklebutch I like to have a drink + a one-person dance party all over the house :D
Me: I see movement what is that WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT 
*2 seconds later*
That is a curtain.

This is why I don't play horror games
#Skyrim
@GlitteryAnimal because ppl think their idle curiosity &gt; your feelings &amp; that's fucking gross
@GlitteryAnimal because NO you don't fucking "gotta ask" IT'S NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS c'mon what is wrong with people?!
