I'm done.
I'm so sick of giving people my ALL, then all of the sudden it never happened.
I'm so sick of guys and their fucking stupid ass games. They make you think they actually give a damn, but sweetie, THEY DO NOT.
I'm so tired of humans
THE SECRET TO THE DRESS IS THAT IF YOU SEE BLUE AND BLACK, YOU MAY HAVE ASTIGMATISM
I'm so sick and tired of people not caring.
I hate life. I hate everything. I feel so sick. I feel so alone. I'm so done with everything.
@JackLovesPandas @KlTTYNJH ...
@PhandomStats YES
@ryannwow hi
@tattedhands 
I get so jealous when I see people being happy with their friends and always having someone to talk to. I want that. I miss that.
Some one please talk to me. I'm so alone.
I'm gonna sleep to mask the pain
I miss Jackson so so much
I need mutuals... I need love.
My eyes are red and glossed over from not sleeping.
The thoughts of you deprive me of my sleep. They keep me drunk and irresponsible. When will I stop trying so hard for people who don't care?
@SooFunnyPost @ExcuseThePuns_ I love Tropic Thunder <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
3:55 am... Goodnight. 
*has to be awake to get ready for school in 20 mins*
Tbh, I kinda miss the blond Ryan <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> But he's still hot af either way 
Yep. 
I'm only going to sleep for 30 minutes tonight and I have school tomorrow. I'm doing this because the thoughts of you deprive me of sleep.
@modeloakley when you bath, does the water change colors? That used to happen to me when I died the tips of my hair rainbow
@altemislune @harryasgubler that's the point. I'm saying no because they're too hot for me to handle.
Still would 100% go straight for @modeloakley. Not even sorry.
@modeloakley nagajhaajnswjwnwjwhenwkdjemwjoeeb I LOVE YOUR HAIR SO MUCH HAN
@harryasgubler @altemislune NO
@bluetofulniall @MrsMelody2 @MatthewLush #supporters lol yay XD
@altemislune your icon hurts my heart...
@AmazingPhil's not relevant, he's just an elephant.
It's 10:49 pm... Should I go eat a Popsicle. I want one. But it's late... Help.

*tries to be mean... Fails*
@XIATinwhite trust me, I have no reason to follow you. You're not a fan account of my favorite youtubers so.

#BestFandomCA2015 Directioners 

@XIATinwhite well I'm sorry, that was a complete mistake
@XIATinwhite kk, then why'd you follow me?
@XIATinwhite I can call you boo if I want.
@XIATinwhite explain this, boo. I even entered it. 
@XIATinwhite @MrsMelody2 @MatthewLush Really? Because he does. Take the time to watch his videos and YouNows. You'd know.
@JaimeGagne but I don't want to burden people with my problems
@XIATinwhite @MrsMelody2 @MatthewLush he literally just did it today... Apparently you didn't see. Sorry. He does them every Sunday.
I'm the friend that people got to for help when they need to vent, but when I need to vent, I turn to a cold metal slither for help...
@XIATinwhite @MrsMelody2 @MatthewLush no? The picture isn't? It's a newer picture of his and this is his first Hushed since the breakup.
@MatthewLush I kinda need advice, but it's a little personal. If I dm you, would you answer?
I want... I need... Love.
Now that the sun is up, I'm gonna actually sleep for once. Night.
@tyleroakley OMFG IS MY BBY OKAY?!
@RickyPDillon YOU OKAY BBY?!
Someone talk to me. Please... Please.
I'm so upset, and I'm sick to my stomach. I'd just like to be okay for once.

Reason #29262827382728278228 why I wish I was a girl 
Murder house shows how much happier life is when you're dead. &gt; The Harmons 
But it also shows how awful it is. &gt; Tate, Beauregard, etc.
But since my friend just watched Murder House for the first time, I decided to rewatch it with her over Oovoo and I love it.
@danny_whatever_ it might not exactly be intentionally. You may perceive it that way, but I don't think it's suppose to be like that.
@danny_whatever_ + to deal with what he's feeling.
@danny_whatever_ + crumbling with it. So give Matt a little time. He's sore. I'm sure Nick is too, but maybe Matt doesn't know how else +
@danny_whatever_ + let slip for a while. When you love someone and that love all the sudden crumbles, it feels like the world is +
@danny_whatever_ + know exactly what happened, but something painful did. Matt's in pain, and there are so things you're going to have to +
@danny_whatever_ @MatthewLush @Nickalaws but like I said, pain does a lot to you. Matt and Nick both went through some shit... We don't +
@danny_whatever_ @MatthewLush @Nickalaws so people tend to deal with things differently. It's a fact of life. Pain does a lot to you.
@lwthoe @MatthewLush if you care so much, then why are you following him and reading his tweets? I mean, seriously. No one's making you.
I turned off my notes for Mail bc I hate this more than I hate my life 
@RyannMinajj omfg XD
Lunar landing = real or a hoax?
@ryansgaybies this sounds demented but I'm demented so
Tate and Violet are goals af. They're so cute. I find Violet's death adorable. She died in his arms. I'm glad they're dead. #sorrynotsorry

One day, you will wake up and realize how perfect he was. When that day comes, he will be waking up beside the man who already knew.
HIS LEGS ARE SO PERFECT! WHY?! 
@CriminaIMQuotes I love Spencer <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

I'm sick and lonely, anyone want to Oovoo?

@MarderosianM thank you
@ryannwow bby, yes you are. You're lovely.
@ryannwow But you're the person that cares about everyone and loves everything. You're perfect. Of course you wouldn't ignore it.
I want to die.
Half of you are too caught up in your own lives to care. You'll ignore this when you see it. I knew it. No one gives a damn.
If I died tonight, would it really affect you as a person? I didn't think so.
@ayysivan no, you don't
@ryannwow @RyannMinajj he's mentioned it in a few videos and in his YouNow's.
Hottest gay porn ever 
Everyone needs to remember this. Drugs are the worst thing I've ever encountered.  
@ConnorFranta SOUR PATCH KIDS HEAVEN
I have never puked so much in one day
@2gays2day gave me Ebola just from watching their YouNow .-. But now I get to skip school to yay!
Can we talk about how Scamy is relationship goals af? <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> I need this please. 
Okay so used to watch Scamy YouNow's and they made me so happy, but I got a new phone and forgot about YouNow. I'm so happy I remember them.
I'm hearing voices and I don't like it
me: 
Bye, Matt! I lush you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Go watch the last few minutes of @MatthewLush's YouNow &gt; 
@JaimeGagne IM SORRY
I'm eating shellfish for the first time and god damn these crab legs are hard to crack
Eating out makes me feeing genuinely uncomfortable and I just don't like being around people.
@lucasdell I can't wait until Hotel premieres <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@fanacconts_af + move on from Nick.
@fanacconts_af You see the way Matt is on camera. You don't know as much about him as you think. He may be looking for someone to help him +
@fanacconts_af so maybe he will find someone. Maybe it will be Lucas. Maybe it won't. But you don't know what he's going to do.
@fanacconts_af Yeah, but Matt is a grown man and as he said on his YouNow, he's the relationship type and he wants to find someone to love.
@idkstephminajj I did the same with mine <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@fanacconts_af you really don't know what Matt would do and wouldn't do.
@fanacconts_af Matt and Nick also might not have been right for each other. Maybe he will date Lucas and they'll be a perfect match.
@fanacconts_af and after all, Matt did go on a Twitter ramp about some illegal things Nick may have done
@fanacconts_af There could be a lot more happening behind those closed doors.
@fanacconts_af plus, you don't really know the truth as to why Nick and Matt broke up. We only see what happens on the screen.
I'm not that cute, but I sometimes tell myself I am just so I don't feel like Jackson's lying to me when he says I am.
.-. 
@troyesivan it actually sounds like a form of acid reflex

niall: well yes this is you and i after turdy seven years 
Yeah.

K. I hate you guys. But not you guys. Yeah, right there. Those 3.
TRXYE before school because I can.
Keith, Mitchell, and Cobin are all straight, but they still manage to flirt with me. What is this. .-.
"Sixx, you look real adorable though, man" - the end of my oovoo call with Keith, Mitchell, and Cobin
I've got this guy trying to convince me that I'm "not fat," I "just have a girl's body w/o the boobs" .-. Wtf is this. YOU'RE NOT HELPING
I'm oovooing a bunch of guys. I asked them what they'd rate me if they were gay (1-10), they all agreed on 58. I feel special now.
Fuck you. Oh my god.
@ryannwow I am on. I date them. I'm currently dating one. I'm currently talking to one. Girls are better than guys.
I hate all humans including myself, and drowning sounds great right now <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@ryansgaybies bitch, I will fucking slay you and make you wish you would have just kept your fucking mouth closed
OKAY, I'M SORRY BUT IF YOU REALLY WANNA ARGUE WITH ME ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY AND WHAT RIGHTS I HAVE AND DON'T HAVE, I'M UP FOR. COME ON.
@WTFSIVAN Okay :)

Arguing with ignorant bitches fuels my sass.

This is turning me on - ‽
@LOHANTHONY This is so me right now, it's not even funny
Favorite this if you're a guy, and you're not a total jerk. Let me know that there is some hope in this world.
@Forevmusic @RyannMinajj BUT NOOOOO! I LOVE BAILEY AND KIKI! OH MY GOD!
Ugh. Guys are such jerks. The only guy I'm not mad at right now is @RyannMinajj. Can I please just be a girl? They're so much nicer.

Remember when Dan orgasmed over Dil's house symmetry? 
I'm rewatching all the Sims 4 videos because why not.
Sometimes, I worry that my love for Dil is greater than my love for Dan and Phil... Nah. Not possible.

@troyesivan @curlytroye THAT SMILE AT THE END DID HURT MY HURT THOUGH
Can I just sleep until the apocalypse where we all die in vain?
This is a goodnight. I wish it could be a goodbye, but too many people would be mad. One day it will be a goodbye, though. <WAVING HAND SIGN><SLEEPING FACE>
I hate the phrase I'm sorry, and I'm sick of using it when I really shouldn't have to.
It's amazing how you can cry without realizing you're crying.

I think all straight people should die.. They're awful humans. We're not here to like the opposing. Just my opinion. 
I woke up in the middle of the night, and the first thing I did was check @RyannMinajj's Twitter. Am I cursed or am I blessed?

#tbt (it's almost Thursday) slay me again @troyesivan 
STOP TWEeting YOUR HeiGhtS it's mAking me feel so sO shORT
@ETERNALSIVAN wtf this is so unfair.
All the tweeting about Troye and Tyde's heights are making me feel short. No. Stop.
girls in my tl that are posting the 4 pictures that make you feel beautiful, you're so gorgeous <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><TWO HEARTS> All pics should make you feel beautiful.
Can I please have an older brother like @troyesivan? Thanks.
@ETERNALSIVAN come on <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> just tell. There's a fairly good chance I'm shorter.
@ETERNALSIVAN lmao, how tall are you?
@fakeasstyler is pissing me off.
There's so much fetus @ETERNALSIVAN on my tl.

Person: What do you look for in a guy?
Me: An eidetic memory.
Person: ... 
@ryansgaybies It does not mean that I have feelings for you. It just means you're an amazing friend, and I care about you.
If you're a girl, there's a good chance I will call you baby, sweetie, gorgeous, beautiful, etc. but do keep in mind, I am gay. G-A-Y.
@CGBPosts I don't know how I feel about this bc Brit shaved her head after struggling with drug use and fighting for her children.
My parents constantly ask what it is that I want from them. I tell them nothing, but I actually just /want/ them to /want./ Want me.

Two dads are better than none <MAN>‍<MAN>‍<BOY>
You left me with 5 hours with nothing to do. So I wrote this song, and I guess it's for you.
@sleepypeterick you're gorgeous Molls<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

There's this guy. He's named Jackson. He's amazing. He's handsome. He's mine.
@RyannMinajj THESE ARE PErfect THANK YOU
Life is no Nintendo game.
But you lied again.
Now you get to watch her leave out the window,
Guess that's why they call it window pane.
@troyentyler I say the same thing every year... I fuck up each time.
Being sad sucks.
Sometimes when I listen to a song, I'll do everything to the beat of it without realizing.
I can't anymore

Your voice resembles a sound that's not yours, like a song that's written with only two chords.
@BeFitFacts @diaryforteens two different people. One's taller. @jayefkay112
Your eyes look dim through this pixelated screen, but I guess that's always been enough for me.
JANDON IS LIFE. THEY ARE THE CUTEST THING IN THE HISTORY OF HISTORY.

I'm scared now.
He's 1,685 miles away. He's 4 years older than me. He's 6'1". But I love him. Not in spite of these things, but because of these things. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I sometimes worry Jackson could be losing his feelings for me.

Today: tired 

Tomorrow: tired 

Next week: tired 

Next month: tired 

Next year: tired 

Next life…
This is so me, it's not even funny. 
@horoscopepics @ohteenquotes I'm a Leo. Where the fuck am I??

@troyesivan Really .-. Really.
@troyesivan YOU WILL HAVE AN AWFUL BRUISE AND YOU WILL REGRET IT SO MUCH OMFG TROYE. WHY
@troyesivan TROYE NO WE SAID DONT
@RyannMinajj I love you, dad.
@RyanMinajllove it's okay. I turn into a jerk when I'm sad, so it's cool.
Right now, I'm not sure if I want to die out of anger or out of sadness.
@fIirting @BaeFeeling I'm the 3rd.
"It doesn't take much to make me sad, but it really doesn't take all too much to make me happy either." — Sixxence 4/20/15
... How do you feel about this, @RyannMinajj 
@happynickalaws I understand the feeling
Okay, yeah. I did fuck up. I always do. I always have. Everything I touch turns into a fucked up mess. I'm a fuck up. Don't you know?
love your hair
love your butt
love your legs
love your body
Love yourself
I fell asleep for like 3 minutes and had a dream that I was cuddling with Jackson, watching Disney movies. I cried when I woke up.
I seem to get more upset when you're not around.
I'm needy, tired, and as always, sad af.
"You ask how I'm feeling. Here's a playlist. Take the time to actually listen for once, and you might find your answer." — Sixx 4/20/15
@RyannMinajj Oh alright, I can't comment <WAVING HAND SIGN>
Maybe Jackson's just getting irritated with me. Maybe he's tired of being in a relationship with someone like me.
I mess up a lot of things and I kinda think Jackson hates me
@RyannMinajj you said plant. Weed is a plant. <HERB> Omg Ryan, you druggy.
@RyannMinajj hey, iggs! <WAVING HAND SIGN>
@RyannMinajj Follow and/or dm? Possibly? Maybe? No? Okay.

God dammit. Why was I even given this life?
I hate being sad. My sadness ruins things for not only me, but others, too. Wouldn't life be easier without me?
@Danisnoto0nfire so true omfg
4/16/15 
@aweconler I only type ily or ily2 if they type it first
@lightfranta this is so true omfg
I hate to say this, but sex ed at my school is hilarious and amazing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Brendon Urie is my weakness
I showed my stepdad these pictures and he said Dan was a pretty little boy... K, papa. 
@JaimeGagne Correct.
I actually just hate human beings.
If you don't love me, just tell me. That's all I ask.
My weaknesses are sexual. I will literally fall so hard for you and obey your every command if you just show that you care about me.
I'm so done. I don't know if I really care too much for anyone anymore. (Excluding Jackson)
PEOPLE WONDER WHY I HATE ALL THINGS IN EXISTENCE AND THEN THEY MAKE ME FEEL AWFUL
Really. I needed you. Where the fuck where you.
Louis is literally the love of my life. I don't show it much, but I love all the boys to death.

@curlytroye you should give it away omg
@troyesivan I love how I'm able to relate to Gasoline without actually relating. I can relate to the opposing side.
@troyesivan oh my god, don't Troye. My lips are still bruised from it.
@troyesivan I wonder how many celebrities just sit there "I'm bored, man. I wanna leak a song."
@MOONLlGHTFRANTA Are you in the UK or something? It's 6:20 am here.
Go ahead, rip my heart out
That's what love's all about
I want you to want me this way
And I need you to need me to stay
I'm not saying Cameron's song is bad, but it's just not my style.
These fandoms are not what they used to be, and they never will be. But you know, I refuse to leave my idols behind. They mean too much.
Just because Troye made a mistake, doesn't mean you have the right to completely leave the fandom. I'm so done with you guys rn.
So yeah, he had a bad day. He made a few mistakes. But everyone does. TROYE FUCKING APOLOGIZED. When we were the ones who needed to.
Troye is just a human, he's not some superhero. You can't expect him to be perfect every step of the way.
It makes me mad that people unfollowed Troye. You know that if you made a joke and ppl went off at you about it, you'd be snarky, too.
School makes me emo.
It's too early to be awake and I don't want to go to school.
I'm gonna sleep before I do something really stupid. Goodnight.
DAN AND PHIL GOT LIKE 8 MILLION TIMES CUTER WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN JAPAN (if that's possible) 
I traced the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone
Arrogant boy,
Cause a scene like you're supposed to.
They'll fall asleep without you.
You're lucky if your memory remains.
Arrogant boy,
Love yourself so no one has to.
They're better off without you.
Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy,
You were never a friend to me
And you can keep all your misery
I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
I feel this emptiness in my chest
It feels surreal, but I’m feeling stressed
I need to do something
I fucked up for nothing
I can't breathe. My chest feels so tight. I can't stop sobbing. I feel so alone. I'm panicking over nothing.
@ryannwow I made one and it's the same as my twit @
I shouldn't be crying. Why the fuck am I crying.
I'm sorry for this and everything else, but I need you more than ever right now. Please.
This is to everyone.
I'm so sorry for tweeting my feelings. I'm so sorry I'm not happy. I want to be, but I can't be. And I'm sorry.
@ryannwow no, but I can make one, I suppose.
I'm so fucked up. When I push people away, I get sad that they don't even try to stay. What's wrong with me?
@ryannwow I'll try a little longer and be strong. That doesn't change what I'm feeling right now. I can't kill myself anyways, I'd hurt ppl
It's sad that the reason I'm still alive is that I don't want to hurt anyone, but the reason I want to die is that people keep hurting me.
@ryannwow I'm so used to being sad that happiness seems so fake. I feel even more lost than I already am when I'm happy. Idk what to do.
- "Your grades dropping."
- "Mommy, I'm going insane, but that's okay because my grades are more important than my mental health anyways."
@ryannwow I've been told that for 15 god damn years and nothing has gotten better. Everything has gotten so much fucking worse.
Why is everything I do... Wrong?
I hate having my mood swings. They scare me. In a matter of seconds, I can go from being so so happy to so so depressed.
@ryannwow it is. That's what you don't realize. I need to die. I want to die. It is the inevitable truth.
@dickalaws ily2

I have more scars and cuts on my wrist than I will ever have friends.
@ryannwow but why? There's not point in me being alive. People would be better off without me. I know they would.
"You must have a reason to be sad?"
- "Not really, I'm always sad for no reason. I guess I'm just never able to find a reason to be happy."
Procrescophobia - the fear of gaining weight

And now I'm just not surprised when people hurt me. I'm actually more surprised when they care.
And in the end, we're just a generation of fucked up kids with broken hearts and scars on our wrists.
- They think I'm going to kill myself.
- Well... Are you?
- Maybe.
@dickalaws ily2
@dickalaws plz don't right now. Any other time but not right now. I get it if you're joking, but I can't take jokes atm.
@dickalaws Molly. I will start an argument about this with you bc I'm not in the mood. The littlest shit can make me mad when I'm upset.
@idkstephminajj I am not arguing this matter.
@idkstephminajj hush. No.
I KNEW IT @AmazingPhil IS A TOP 
Sorry for my next tweet, but I thought it was funny. Phil is still forever a bottom.
"If I were a stranger who just met you, I would think you were a lesbian girl, not a gay boy." — Cameron, 9:37 pm, 4/19/15
If I had a penny for every time I've wanted to die, I'd not only be a billionaire, I'd drown in the money. Which wouldn't be all too bad.

@ryanismydad okay
@ilytronnor @addictingsivan I don't even care if it was a drag or slay, at least I got a reply from Troye and that made me day 10x better.
@ilytronnor @addictingsivan I feel like this is my fault. But I think he should. I don't mind his reply. He stood up for himself. It's ok.
Okay, if anyone's up for it; who wants to do a huge group oovoo today?

@liliyida123 @MatthewLush Thanks? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> Why am I cute?
@PeacefulKordei @MatthewLush ??
@RyannMinajj @ArianaGrande Lol, best mom
@PeacefulKordei @MatthewLush Thanks? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@ryannwow No, it's fine. Just another bad day. Not a big deal.
@MatthewLush Och, dlaczego dziękuję.
@ConnorFranta Four days to go! #4DaysUntilConnorsBook Can't way! Preorder how, guys. 
I had a bad day. I didn't get to talk to Jackson, my parents are ignoring me, I feel horrible, I'm questioning my sexuality. And. Sigh.
So I told my brother I've been self harming a lot lately, and he now feels like he did something wrong.
My brother is wearing a shirt with the sleeves cut off and jeans. It's pissing me offfffff.
MY BROTHER LOVES ME MORE THAN YOU
@MatthewLush You can always marry me. I mean I'm gay. Sure I'm a little underage, (15) but you know. Not a big deal, right?<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I'm so sick of constantly messing up
I'm fat and I have dog hair. Nice.
Remind me to never let anyone cut my hair again.
I literally look like a dog.
@MatthewLush I take Latin, so it's easier to learn other languages.
@MatthewLush French is awesome though
I GOT A HAIRCUT AND NOW I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING DOG. MY STEPDAD SAID HE WANTED ME TO LOOK MORE MASCULINE AND NOW I JUST LOOK LIKE A FREAK.
@RyannMinajj We need to plan first.
@RyannMinajj Wait. Where do you want to go?
@RyannMinajj Sure. On my way!
@MatthewLush yay, tell him your fans say congrats <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Hm. Not sure how I feel about this. But it kinda looks good on Zayn. 
Trust is like a piece of paper. Once it has been ripped and crumbled, it can't ever be the same again.
I still feel like shit. Like I'm not good enough.
Bye bye, hair! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Why do the kids at my school hate me so much?
I'm just a young, little, gay boy that will never be good enough for anyone.
I drink a lot of coffee when stressed and in public
I still think the "bands and stuff" playlist on 8tracks is the best thing in the world.
@tumblrphanz that's so paining and weird
I'm so tired omg
Goodnight <SPARKLING HEART>
Dominant me please.
@Harry_Styles @Louis_Tomlinson thanks for this harry
@MatthewLush it's okay boo
My initials make me a snake. SSS...
I'm literally so gay that my favorite food is bananas.

@RyannMinajj XD calm
@RyannMinajj HOW SCARY?!
I used to not be attracted to humans. Just anime. Now I'm attracted to humans with penises. But anime characters with penises are cool, too.
It hurts so bad, but it feels so good.
#Tweet4PicturesWithoutLooking They're all of Ryan<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm laughing 
@RyannMinajj sorry I won't be watching your YouNow. I'm not in a very good mood, but I still love you to bits and pieces <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
People expect me not to be insecure. People want me to stop having low self esteem. They want me to love myself. Yet they do this shit. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Lol. What do I have to do to be good enough? XD
@TheLarryVines @hecoxhoran And since he is MALE, he would be the DAD. So stop. I get what you mean, but it's a joke. Chill.
@RyannMinajj I understand
@RyannMinajj same.
I'm going to sleep.
I thought I was having a good day
I don't want to cry. I have absolutely no reason to cry. I feel just dandy. I'm okay. I just feel like I'm going to cry.
I just fucking cracked my phone. Why am I having such a bad day. Why is everything so fucked up for me?
I need some Tylenol
I feel kind of sick still .-.
This was my favorite Joesph haircut. 
I'm sleeping off this hangover bc it's still pretty bad. Night <VICTORY HAND>️
Check out this @8tracks playlist: "Bands and stuff" This is literally the world's best playlist.  
@RyannMinajj Do you love me?
Ugh, my head hurts so fucking much
I have a fucking exam today and I have an awful hangover .-.
STUdies Show TYLENOL CAN NOT ONLY DULL PHYSICAL pAin BUT EMPTIONAL PAIN TOO OMSG
I have a massive headache.
I really don't like pickles.
You say you're done with me, but I'm the one who's done with life.
@ryannwow XD yep
"I just realized that if you put your foot on the brake and try to drive a car, it doesn't move." - Parker
@amazingphilz Same.
Do you ever just get tempted to complete run away and disappear?
I have an awful stomach ache
Happy Jackie Robinson Day <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>🏾<BASEBALL>️
I worry about Parker sometimes :( he always looks so sad but he never talks to me
@ryannwow it's cool bc the store is called fantasyland
@ryannwow Thanks cx
Do what you will when I say this but... Marilyn Monroe is my queen.
I'm in a vintage record store. It's like heaven. Oh my fucking God.
@MatthewLush Yay!
@RyannMinajj Omfg Ryan XD why
@MatthewLush have fun <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Fhsnsndlemedbsonenekgsjd my best friend is cuter than yours!! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I love Matt. I love Nick. I love them both. And it's okay if they don't love each other.
@ryannwow Glad I'm not the only one <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>🏻
Every time I get out of the shower, I just want to run to my room, climb in bed, and sleep. Who needs clothes.
@lushgaybies fuck. I'm crying now.
@lushgaybies and that's why I hate long distance because you can't lay with the person while they sleep so...
@lushgaybies but then if you go to bed, I can feel my heartbreak. That's why I hate the night.
If you talk to me after midnight, I get excited bc I'm probably sad and need a sweet little distraction.
I get most lonely and sad at night. Especially after 12:00.
If you pick me up when hugging me or kissing me, I swear to god I will fall for you harder than that bus hit Regina George.
@WhiteGirIs my nephew had those pjs <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ConnorFranta Gosh! Connor, I'm so proud of you! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
These 3 accounts need to be reported. Everyone help please. 
Help.
This is awesome
@MatthewLush omfg can't wait to see the video

@ConnorFranta did you ever get frustrated and just want to quit?
Parker (bestie) and I have awkwardly amazing conversations. 
@ConnorFranta Yes! Please!
@lushgaybies yes I did just go and save the last 4 pictures he tweeted
Jackson (my one and only) appreciation post <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ It makes me so happy and proud to call him mine, and only mine. 
@ConnorFranta appreciation post <TWO HEARTS> 
@lookatbio_3 Guess what, asshole. You can't do shit. Because of all the people who support and love her, you're attempts are just worthless.

@FangirlLife_x #StayStrongEmma
Can everyone please report @lookatbio_3 and @bbbarcs. They're both participating in a horrible act. 
@bbbarcs @lookatbio_3 you two need mental help. What on earth is wrong with you?!
@lookatbio_3 you're a sick person. Why the hell are you doing this?
@FangirlLife_x @lookatbio_3 @stereoftbibby dear god, don't please I love you.
To all those who think Phil tops: 
@Hai_Oakley @modeloakley @glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly 
@modeloakley @Hai_Oakley @glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly Phil just couldn't dominate someone.
@Hai_Oakley @modeloakley @glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly Yes. Phil bottoms. He's a complete and utter bottom. Okay.
PART OF MY OPINION THAT DAN TOPS PROBS COMES FROM ME WANTING HIM TO FUCK ME AGAINST A WALL OOPS
@Hai_Oakley @modeloakley @glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly Phil. Is. A. Bottom.

April fucking Fools I am a bomb ass looking wonderful person <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
person: take off your jacket
me: this is my outfit
@Hai_Oakley @modeloakley @glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly oh my god. I feel so lied to right now. Dan tops. My opinion will not change.
@modeloakley I can't see Phil topping.
@modeloakley Phil is needy, tbh and that's why I see him as a bottom. He's always so loving and it's like he just wants to be held.
Omfg guys. Dan tops.
@modeloakley @glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly @hai_oakley Phil is an innocent little twink bottom. Dan tops. That's all.
@glitchingoakley @awkwardtilly omfg no. Phil is such a twink bottom.
@modeloakley Dan.
My teacher got so pissed when she found out I'm missing exams tomorrow XD there was such an awkward silence 
But fetus Ryan is so cute <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
I constantly say "okay" when talking with my parents just to get them to shut up.
Before showering: no... I don't want to get in.
While showering: no... I don't want to get out.
Sorry if I double, triple, or quadruple text you. I just can't gather my thoughts in one single message.
I told her I'm moving and she started crying. I feel so so bad.
I worry about my best friend bc I'm moving and she literally only has one friend. Me.
I've just been in a bad mood since like 2010.
Both my best friends are near the same height as me. We're short. Maybe we're friends so we don't feel undermined by the height difference.
I feel like Ryan may have went through a stage in his life where all he really wore were stripes and patterns... 
Evan Peters is a silly, random little goofball. I love that booboodaddy. XD
Goodnight Jackson <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ I love you. 
I love Joseph 
I suppose I've found a photo of baby @Joe_Sugg holding a koala. 
Can we all just stop and take a moment to appreciate and remember blonde, baby @Joe_Sugg 
Evan Peters is so random and cute and I love that booboodaddy XD
@RyannMinajj Do ya like my home screen ??

Your eyes get heavy.
You choke on words.
Your heart breaks.
You bite your lip.
Your eyes water.
You start to sob.
Crying sucks.
@KlTTYNJH I would get on Omegle vid but I have an ugly face XD

@KlTTYNJH I once cried because this cute guy on Omegle disconnected
@KlTTYNJH how cute? I need proof.
@lushgaybies She's sweet and I think she knows I like being called that. So it makes me smile.
There's this girl in my religion and bible studies class. Everyday, she gives me a high five and says "hey, my favorite pretty boy"
@RyannMinajj when is it again?
@bottomvstop he's a top, only with some people, though.
My emotions haven been off the charts lately.
My hand feels like it's being chopped off .-.

This is actually really smart.

@Internet_child_ @ryanismydad Nick is getting Weebo, and Nick isn't playing any part in the milestones anymore. And it seems Nick is moving.
I'm starting to think that because no one cares, why should I care?

First love = irreplaceable. 
First heartbreak = unforgettable.
*bangs head against a wall* I. Want. To. Die.
I like blood.

When others are upset, I automatically assume that I don't have the right to be upset because they've already claimed that emotion... Idk.
I'm such a bad person. When I'm upset, I want someone to hold me and tell me it's okay. That's so selfish of me.
Hm. I'm irrelevant. So goodnight. <TWO HEARTS>

2015: *worries people won’t know I’m gay*

Yeah I'm not gay I'm just homosexual
Okay. This pisses me off to a great extent.

F…
@loveyzayn @KlTTYNJH it's obviously me strutting the streets and twerking to Stockholm Syndrome. Duh.
Omg can someone please dm me. I'm so bored.

Can't wait till Wednesday <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
But honestly. Do pinecones have low self esteem?
God I love Evan Peters. 
I love this 
Guys. Why is @troyesivan so adorable. I smile so much watching his videos.
Oh how things have changed.
Since everyone is so upset right now, I'm gonna stay happy <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> dm me if you need to talk.
@dickalaws yep
I thought fasting was supposed to help <UNAMUSED FACE>
*bangs head against the wall* I GAINED 4 POUNDS
I'm gonna go weigh myself <CONFOUNDED FACE>

@ryanismydad .-.
@FunnyVines @MatthewLush XD
@ryanismydad <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ryanismydad That might be what caused it
@ryanismydad you're welcome bae
@ryanismydad it's probably from too much pressure on the back of the phone
@ryanismydad :/ I'm sorry
@chocoxharry I actually like it
@ryanismydad it'll probably cost more to get internal crack fixed because you have to take it apart.
@ryanismydad the first layer of the screen is cracked, but not the second
@ryanismydad it's internally cracked
I took some sore throat numbing agent, but that only numbed the top of my throat and the pain is coming from the middle section .-.
But now it feels like there's knives in my neck when I talk
I woke up and my voice is back.

It's 4:03 am so... I should probably sleep. It comforts me to do this even when you're asleep. Goodnight, Jackson <SPARKLING HEART> I love you #Jaxxsonce
Goodnight <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@KlTTYNJH sweetie, you probably should. You might have a stomach virus. It's spring so it wouldn't be too surprising if so.
@KlTTYNJH and if you do, you need to start some antibiotics before it worsens.
@KlTTYNJH have you seen a doctor?
@KlTTYNJH are you sick?
@KlTTYNJH you can
@sleepingoakley e.d its a new thing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@sleepingoakley why're you online? e.d
Idk if I'm even going to school tomorrow. I feel so sick and so so awful.
@pinkIaceIouis same <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Fldushrjdj I'm watching some of Troye's fetus videos. He's so adorable.
*stays up on YouTube all night*
I want to stop crying.
I just want to hear someone's voice honestly.
@KlTTYNJH okay. Thank you so much.
@KlTTYNJH I don't like him knowing when I'm upset. It hurts him, so I just don't tell him. I keep it inside.
@KlTTYNJH He's asleep.
@KlTTYNJH thank you
@KlTTYNJH I'll end up sleeping. Even if it means crying myself to sleep. You don't have to worry.
@KlTTYNJH It's fine. I go through this every night. It's nothing new.
My body wants to sleep. But my mind doesn't agree. My mind wants to stay up and think up every stupid little possibility.
I want to sleep. I've been trying to sleep for the past 4 hours. But my mind just keeps going "be depressed about this," "and that," "cry."
What do you do if you don't know what you're feeling, but you know it's everything but happiness, and it makes you want to cry so much.

Me: 
it really hurts when you think you actually mean something to someone and they just turn around and prove you wrong.
@modeloakley ILYSM TOO <SPARKLING HEART><TWO HEARTS>
@ryanismydad aw well thank you, I love you too <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
