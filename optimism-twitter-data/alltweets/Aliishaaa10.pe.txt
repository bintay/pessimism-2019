I don't understand how I can have toner and facial wash in my bag but not face/body cream <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
My arms are dry and ashy and I don't have any cream and it's too hot to wear my jacket and I'm wearing a vest top...fml <PENSIVE FACE>
At this rate I'm not gonna get this visa. It's so annoying that the visa section at the embassy is only open between 10-12 on a weekday <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
짜파게티 is vile. At least I know now to stay away from that 짜장면!!

Topp Dogg are coming to London in September...so tempted.
I'd be so pissed if my language school is in Gangnam...I booked all my hotels in Mapo <FLUSHED FACE>
I think this is it for me...not gonna 'glo up' any time soon <FLUSHED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
