@Os2632 Donno seeing my boy @OBJ_3 on üá®üá¶thanksgiving in Philly pretty sweet too!

@GoogleFacts but are they the same price?
it's budget day nationally in Canada but more importantly the NFL schedule comes out at 6 PM MST #YEEEHAAAW
Not ONLY is it Monday, but it's the day the Eagles sign Tebow. @Eagles @Eagles_fans10 @Fightin4Philly @PHIEagleFans #WHY?

@Fightin4Philly I'm at the point I'm just closing my eyes tight &amp; will open them when the dust settles. What a roller coaster this offseason
So Philly has Butt Fumble and a grown man who has been outta the NFL since 2012 who 'Tebows' now at the helm. #GodHelpUsPhillyFans
