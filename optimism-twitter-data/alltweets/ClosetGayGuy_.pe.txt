@doobee23sf I'm sorry that I'm missing that! lol
@ScottyBoyNick You're welcome! <WINKING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@ScottyBoyNick Oh, wow, you're so sexy! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ClosetGayGuy_ I wish she'd mentioned that when Dad wasn't home and in a bad mood, I may have used that as a coming out, ice breaker. HaHa
My mom is sitting here talking about how my Sis' used to lock me in the closet all the time when we were kids. #ironic HaHa
Night time is always the worst for me, thinking about life and feeling depressed and hopeless.
I need one of these to help come out to my parents.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> HaHa 
@JermShelton @thehypebabies This sounds like me, especially the "I'm so nervous" part, I'd probably be so nervous, I'd be shaking. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>HaHaHa
@ClosetGayGuy_ Anyone wanna plan on letting my parents catch us making out or something? HaHa
@mdmpsyd I don't know if they'd recognize me, but they'd recognize their bathroom floor, doorway, furnace vent, etc, in it. HaHa
If they did, that would be hilarious. Just start tweeting @ them, excessively. HaHa  
@mdmpsyd If they did, just @ their name, is that what you're saying? That would be funny! lol
@mdmpsyd No. lol
Trying to figure the best way to break the news to my super homophobic parents, that I'm actually SUPER gay! HaHa
@ConnorFranta This tweet pretty much sums up my life. HaHa
@RedRedRectangle Hadn't even thought of that. HaHa
@ClosetGayGuy_ Unfortunately, coming out is only about half my problem, I've also gotta dig myself outta this rut that I'm in. lol
I'm starting to feel less afraid of coming out.
@mdmpsyd Yes, I was just thinking that. HaHa
Picslip is down. Thanks for the confidence boost, guys. lol
Grindr shows that the cute neighbor guy was 16 feet away, 10 mins ago, did I miss him sitting on our porch or something? Hope not! lol
@NWOhioBiGuy Aww, thanks.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@mdmpsyd Yeah, I'm kinda at the point now where I can't decide what scares me more, coming out of the closet, or staying in it.
I'm considering posting an actual picslip, face and all.
@KurtDansby24 I have a lot of those days.
@DCHomos @asherhuey One of the back roads here is called "Gay Rd" they say it meant happy, still think I'm supposed to live there. HaHa
I really did come out to the neighbor guy this time, then I found out he's moving.<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I never even spoke to this guy, but what a mean thing to say. 
@ClosetBromo @xuberflote There are always guys like that who just can't take a hint. lol
@ClosetGayGuy_ The neighbor guy couldn't see my exact distance, just knew I was close. After all this, I'm considering telling him who I am.
@mdmpsyd I'm not one of those guys who tans, I don't even try, with red head skin, the more sunscreen, the better. lol
Clearly, I need to start working out more soon, I'll post a better avi if/when I see some results. lol
@NWOhioBiGuy Thanks! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
You guys, my avi is now me. I didn't think I'd ever do that. I don't know if it's good or bad, but it's me. HaHa
@sethsutton3 The one I accidentally outed myself to. I should go wake him up, if I can't sleep, neither should he. HaHa
I'm guessing I probably won't get much sleep tonight. A shame, wonder if the neighbor guy would wanna cuddle? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> HaHa
@ClosetGayGuy_ OK, I think I have a plan, I'm gonna get really fat, really quick, then he'll never suspect that shirtless pic is of me. HaHa
@ColfersAngel I don't know, I'm shaking, feel sick at my stomach right now, so scared.
@ClosetGayGuy_ I'm not replying, I'm going to bed and pretending this never happened.
No, no, ,no, no, no, no, no! Think I've just been outed by grindr (to the neighbor guy) thought location was off. 
Life generally has me feeling very confused.
Trying to stop over thinking and get some sleep, 
goodnight, twitter.
@cllewis988 I REALLY wish I could. I can't get past the fear that he might hate me or something.
@integreatness_ My poor mom? She was the one who went outside and left the door standing wide open. HaHa
Neighbor guy changed his pic on grindr.<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Why must he be so cute, it's torture.<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@cllewis988 I don't go to either of those, but my family has been talking about going to the beach this Summer, I'm seriously terrified.
@ClosetGayGuy_ All the hot guys showing off more skin, the warmer it gets, constantly tell myself, control yourself, don't look!<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>lol
I feel like it's so much easier to stay in the closet in the Fall/Winter months than Spring/Summer, it's almost impossible.
@doobee23sf Smooches back to you.<FACE THROWING A KISS> HeHe
Goodnight, twitter, thanks to so many of you for always being there for me, it really means a lot. *hugs*
@ColfersAngel Thanks.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Actually woke up in a good mood today, before my parents started in yelling at me, what a horrible person I am.<CRYING FACE>
@mdmpsyd Yes, I've found him on grindr, I don't have a pic up or anything.
@mdmpsyd Nah, no hookups, just browsing. lol
@doobee23sf You're welcome.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@doobee23sf Can't help but notice, you are extremely attractive.<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> lol
@docbuckley Thanks.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> I've kinda been planning it for a while, think it will happen soon, can't stand the stress for much longer.
@docbuckley Yes, my parents send me really mixed signals, I think that maybe they know but don't want to hear it.
@ChiBromoNerd I've definitely met more nice guys through twitter, the only problem is that they're so far away, guess that's why we use it.
@doobee23sf Yes, a lot of them do seem to only say "hey" and "wassup" to me too. HaHa
@doobee23sf I'd probably delete it, if it weren't for the fact that I'm hoping to get the nerve to tell the cute neighbor guy who I am. lol
@doobee23sf Some guys just act mean after a few replies, I can't figure out why they're so angry. lol
@ClosetGayGuy_ Although, I've met a few good friends on there, so I can't say they're all nasty, but some guys are so unnecessarily mean.
Don't know why everyone on grindr is so mean, I realized that I'm just a random person to them, but still don't have to be so nasty.
As I walked from the bathroom to my room in my underwear, I realized the front door was wide open, sorry, neighbors! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> HaHa
Goodnight, twitter.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@ClosetGayGuy_ As I get braver, I'll eventually post a picslip of my face too, I'm getting there. lol
@awesomealex2195 I'm sorry. *hugs*
@awesomealex2195 Thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Bored tonight, so here's another partial picslip. lol 
Talking to people who have their lives together and all figured out, always make me feel so ashamed of myself.
@buckeyebromo If he turned you down, he must be crazy. #JustSaying
@AnonGayTech Nah, if my Sis knew, the whole world would know before I finished speaking the sentence. lol
I was actually so close to coming out to my Mom when my Sis randomly showed up with her kids.
@14TeamMocker Aww, thanks for saying that.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Think I've been having an anxiety attack for a solid week now, no exaggeration, wish I were brave enough to come out and get this over with.
@mdmpsyd I guess I'm really just too shy and awkward, I'm bad at talking to people, making conversation, starting conversations, etc.
@frantasjumper Hey, thanks for the follow back.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mdmpsyd I'd like to, he's not outside much and seems to run to and from the car. Probably wouldn't be into me anyway. But he's so cute. lol
Just spotted, cute, gay neighbor running around in shorts.<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I'll admit, I think I have a bit of a crush on him. lol
@ClosetGayGuy_ Well, I suppose that's one way I could come out... lol
Why the heck would I wanna log in to a gay dating app through FB??? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> HaHa
@Dre_4Christ You're welcome. Yes, there are definitely lots of other guys out there like you, you're definitely not alone.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@AnonGayTech The issue hasn't really dropped or anything, but today was a little better than yesterday.
Mom keeps telling me that my problem is that I just need to get a girlfriend. I have many problems, but that's not one of them! HaHa
@ColfersAngel Aww, thanks so much. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Thanks to so many of my followers for being there for me, it really means a lot, especially now, you guys are the best. *hugs* <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@mdmpsyd Aww, thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@AnonGayTech Thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@cllewis988 Aww, thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
The more I hint at it, the more hateful they become. Could really use a hug, guess I'll just go to sleep now.
This whole day has been so messed up, discouraging and depressing, I just don't know if my parents will ever accept me, and I almost told.
@cllewis988 Thanks. In my experience, it kinda feels like getting punched in the stomach, u feel sick &amp; angry and have to act like ur fine.
My favorite fairytale that my parents ever told me, is the one where you somehow, magically choose your sexuality, like it's a choice! HaHa
@cllewis988 Not really, they just do that sometimes (a lot of the time) it's why I lived in denial (and hated myself) so long.
@cllewis988 Thanks, they've definitely been on a roll today.
My parents should seriously get some other hobbies, aside from gay bashing, it's getting old. <CONFUSED FACE>
@life_of_ty1 Goodnight. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@life_of_ty1 You're welcome. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@life_of_ty1 Thanks, you do the same. I don't know how much help I am, but I'm always here if you need to talk. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@life_of_ty1 Of course I understand. Been reading your tweets, I deal with depression a lot too, some days are a real struggle.
@life_of_ty1 Aww, I'm sorry, I know it's hard sometimes. *hugs*
@1stGayPresident You're welcome. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@1stGayPresident Wow, you're really cute! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@cllewis988 Sometimes, finding something really dumb and random to watch helps, it always seems to be dumb stuff that cheers me up. lol
@cllewis988 TV definitely helps, &amp; music helps sometimes, but sometimes it's so bad, you just gotta sleep it off and hope tomorrow's better.
@integreatness_ Thanks, glad you like it, just saying what's on my mind. lol
@integreatness_ Hey, thanks, that means a lot. And thanks for following.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I hate feeling depressed, makes everything seem so much worse than it is. I try to remind myself, it's like your mind playing tricks on you.
@cllewis988 Oh, cool, thanks, might check that one out soon. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@BrettJSimpson I've always loved Reba, but never heard where she stood on the issue of gay rights, made me happy to read this.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>

@buckeyebromo No, that makes sense, that's how I feel sometimes too.
@morgan__v They reran the original so much, I still feel like I have it memorized. lol Will be cool to see how they remake it.
@ArchieComics @parentdaniel They're all fun, but Kevin Keller is my favorite, need more stories about him.
@xuberflote That sucks, one of the worst feelings, I'm sorry.
@NWOhioBiGuy Wish a few had said something nice, they kinda acted like nothing happened, after I poured my heart out, awkward. lol
@NWOhioBiGuy Funny thing is, I came out as gay on my main account, no one said anything, except one asked me if I was just confused.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>HaHa
@NWOhioBiGuy Yes, it definitely takes time. I just am getting to a point where I'm tired of hiding it, the fear rules your life.
@NWOhioBiGuy Aww, thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I am starting to be ok with people knowing I'm gay, just not quite ready to tell the family yet. lol
@mdmpsyd Thanks, probably because I'm in the closet, just finally starting to get brave enough to talk to a few guys around here.
I feel like I'm finally getting braver about all of this. May leave this partial picslip up for a while, it's nice not being totally anon.
@josh_hancjod Thanks! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@cllewis988 Aww, thanks so much. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I've never done a picslip &amp; I'm scared to show my face, but here's a partial picslip, 1st time I've done this. lol 
@life_of_ty1 I'm sorry you're feeling alone, I feel that way sometimes, it's not fun. *hugs*
Anybody read any good books that helped you accept being gay? I could really use something like that, would love some recommendations.
@JermShelton You DM'd me, I can't reply because you don't follow me.
@JermShelton Just saw your profile on grindr, 10 miles away, small world. lol
My abs are FINALLY starting to show again,
first time since before thanksgiving. HaHa
@mdmpsyd It's been pretty good, thanks.
Sorry I haven't been on here much, hope you all are having a good week. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@nobfhere Yeah, today hasn't been fun, so much anxiety, I'm just glad it's over, need time to emotionally recover. lol
I've had enough of my homophobic family asking me why I don't have a girlfriend today, all day long, this is why I don't like holidays.
Same here! HaHa 
Whoops auto correct I meant pillow"
@RIWWEFan No, it says in my bio that it's not me, I'm afraid to post a pic of me until after I come out.
@RIWWEFan Aww, thanks so much for the encouraging message, it means a lot. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@jrado95 Sounds like fun.
They're normal..#cutecouple #muchlove #samelove h…
@morgan__v Great pic, so sexy.
I'm actually straight. #AprilFools HaHa
Warm weather is difficult, girls are dressing slutty and I'm supposed to act like I care, but I can't when there's gorgeous guys around. lol
Awkward, Dad telling me to notice girls out today as I'm trying to avoid staring at some hot guys in muscle shirts and shorts. *drools* HaHa
I do want abs, just not quite as much as I seem to want food. #TheStruggle HaHa
@RomanticTwink Me too!
I'm not usually a cryer, but tonight I have been, wish I had a cute boyfriend to hug me, cuddle with me and tell me it will be alright.
Of course gay guys cry a lot more than straight guys, it's hard accepting yourself, worrying about coming out &amp; who will still stand by you.
Hate it when I can't sleep, over think everything and end up feeling super depressed.
@zuberflote Yes, and cuddle, that would be so nice.
@Tommybozzz @leewhowrites You're welcome, of course. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Tommybozzz @leewhowrites You guys are such a cute couple. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> #RelationshipGoals
@music_when Aww, thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I also know that my parents are onto me, it's just a matter of time, I can't wait to be able to have a boyfriend.



Thank you x 

I promise I'm just watching you to get new workout ideas…

Sincerely,
Thirsty and Closeted Gay G…
@RomanticTwink You can open up to me, you're not getting rid of me any time soon. HaHa
I honestly can't wait to have a boyfriend, I'm starting to feel like I want that more than I'm afraid of coming out.
@MirkoNtl94 Well, you can be both, cute and sweet, if a guy who looked like you lived near me, I'd definitely wanna know him. lol
@MirkoNtl94 Well, I'm definitely not 50, I'm 24, and I think you're very attractive. But we all feel unattractive sometimes.
@MirkoNtl94 Don't feel horrible, you're very attractive.
Feels good to get back into working out, my body is sore, but my mind feels so clear. lol
@RomanticTwink Pretty good. lol
@carteroooo It definitely keeps getting better, it's such a funny show, love it, wish there were more eps.
@RomanticTwink Aww, thanks, I miss talking to you too.
@carteroooo I've already finished watching it, but you made me feel like starting over. lol Can't wait to see the next season.
This has happened to me, recently, awesome! HaHa
@ClosetBromo Yeah, that guy messaged me the other day, he's just like 30 miles away. lol
@josh_hancjod I don't have a clue what to do, I wasn't really planning on coming out yet, but now I feel like it's happening, ready or not.
@ClosetBromo That is someone who lives near me, you must not be too far away.
Overheard my parents talking earlier &amp; realized that they're onto me (still sound as hateful towards gays as ever) I'm honestly so scared!
@JermShelton That's me, every single night. lol
@BlackLightGay Yeah, it's very disappointing, thought I could just make friends with some guys around here, but nobody wants to be friends.
Think I'll delete grindr now, I was so much better off not knowing the gays in this area. lol
@awesomealex2195 You're welcome. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@godschild777201 You're welcome, thanks for following. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@MattFinn20 Aww, thanks so much for the shout out. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@IHateHomophobia Thanks so much for the follow back. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Sometimes twitter is like therapy. Especially when it comes to topics I can't discuss with anyone who knows me in person. lol
@BlackLightGay Yeah, I feel like I've made a lot of progress accepting myself these past few months, just not that much progress. lol
@BlackLightGay Yes, and I feel like you have to be really be ready to come out before you can meet anyone, then it really becomes real.
@BlackLightGay On the other hand, I don't feel like I'm ready for anything like that just yet, getting there, but not just yet.
@BlackLightGay I have absolutely no experience either, and I'm afraid of being caught and outed. (gotta come out eventually, anyway)
I feel bad because this guy is really nice &amp; really wants to meet me, says we could just hang out, but I'm scared to do anything like that.
@leewhowrites Thanks, I sure hope so.
@leewhowrites You guys are adorable, I want a cute relationship like yours. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I hug my pillow and pretend it's a cute guy, that's obviously the closest I'm getting for quite a while. lol
Can't sleep at all tonight, still wide awake.
@GayAlabama @gaycyclone Thanks, yeah, I'm looking for more than that too.
@gaycyclone I don't know, all these guys are just looking for sex and hooking up, it's sad.
@ClosetGayGuy_ Never mind, evidently my life is a joke or something. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Can't believe I'm actually talking to a cute, sweet guy from the same town as me, really wish I were out.
This girl I went to school with has started liking all my pics on FB lately. Nice try, honey, barking up the wrong, gay tree. HaHa
@mymindwritten Sounds familiar, it sucks when they just stop talking just when you were feeling like there was a real connection.
@JermShelton You're welcome, hope it's a good one.
@JermShelton Happy Birthday!!! <BIRTHDAY CAKE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><BALLOON>
@Dustin_Fincher Yes, and as you start to accept yourself, it starts to hurt less and less. Thanks. *hugs back* <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Dustin_Fincher Hopefully, but it really doesn't bother me too much when they say stuff like that anymore, it used to really hurt.
I love it when my parents are gay bashing while I'm casually sitting across the room, tweeting about it on my secret gay account. HaHa
@RomanticTwink Story of my life right there, then I always wonder if they know about me, and then I panic a little. HaHa
@MattFinn20 Hey, thanks for the follow back. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>

twitter: being honest with complete strangers
@RomanticTwink I have the same problem. HaHa
@kyriakoutsakos I wish, that would be amazing.
Had the most amazing dream, that he called me up in the middle of the night &amp; told me that he missed me too. I want that to be true, so bad.
@Dustin_Fincher Yes, it was pretty good, thanks.
@DanteLaw21 Yes, I wore green today too. HaHa
@kyriakoutsakos Thanks, it was pretty good.
Hope y'all had a good St Patrick's Day. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@xellam05 Yes, I totally understand that, I always have to psyche myself up to be in any social situation, can be exhausting.
@RomanticTwink I have had like REALLY extreme anxiety lately too, people who don't have it really don't understand what a struggle it is.
People make me so mad gossiping about other's sexuality, it's NEVER ok to out anyone who isn't ready, no exceptions.
@NWOhioBiGuy That's how I always feel, those guys are so hot. lol
@kyriakoutsakos I had never used it before, finally downloaded it the other day, just out of curiosity. lol
Not that I'd really hook up with anyone like that, I'd be way too afraid of getting caught, but it's sad there are none around here.
Checked out Grindr to see if there were any gays around here, all I found was an older, "straight" (married to a woman) neighbor. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>HaHa
Living with loneliness is a heck of a lot less painful than getting your hopes up and being disappointed.
@kyriakoutsakos Yes, other than being a little annoyed at twitter at the moment, I'm good. lol
@kyriakoutsakos Yeah, the twitter app signed me out when it updated, didn't think I'd ever get back in, but I FINALLY did. lol
Just spent hours trying to get signed back into this account, evidently, I didn't remember the password or email I used. lol
Loneliness always hits me so hard at night.
@kyleo1992 Thanks, and thanks for following. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I'm only out to my friends on here so far. lol
@RealASamuel Thanks for following. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@kyriakoutsakos Aww, thanks so much. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@kyriakoutsakos Because I'm in the closet, I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a boyfriend or anything, pretty lonely feeling.
@kyriakoutsakos I'm getting used to it too.
@kyriakoutsakos Yeah, being lonely is the worst.
When I see happy gay couples, I think to myself 
"yeah, I'm gonna die alone!" HaHa
@RomanticTwink If you promise! lol
You've definitely got your work cut out for you now! HaHa
@RomanticTwink No, you never mentioned that before.
With my luck, I'd end up going dateless again! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> HaHa
@RomanticTwink I can tell, It will be huge, will become an annual event for all the gays who didn't get to enjoy their prom.
@RomanticTwink I think that's an awesome idea! 
(kinda reminds me of that ep of The Big Bang Theory where they re-created prom lol)
@RomanticTwink I never went to those, I went once, dateless, that was enough for me, felt so awkward and embarrassed. HaHa
@RomanticTwink Thanks, I'm glad I do. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@RomanticTwink Aww, thanks! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Y'all should go follow my friend's new account @RomanticTwink <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
It's sad realizing that I will always miss this guy who is probably long over me, that's the worst feeling.
@ClosetBromo I know what you mean, I've been feeling that way a lot lately too.
@ben_roark_ben Stripper, there's a career I had not considered, I need to start working out like crazy! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> HaHa
@DanteLaw21 Hey, thanks, and thanks for following! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Dustin_Fincher I guess so, it just kinda sucks feeling like you have no friends and you annoy people, that's where I'm at right now. lol
@Dustin_Fincher I hate it too, it's the worst.
@GayAlabama Hey, thanks for following! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Dustin_Fincher Hey, nothing much. lol
Feeling super lonely right now.
@MirkoNtl94 You're welcome, thanks for following! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Let me give you a hug.
No? Lay your head on my shoulder.
Guys don't do that?
It's sad the closeness guys l…

...me

...a heterosexual <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@thatgaytnteen Yeah, that's at least a little better, at least the sun is shining today, I'm SO READY for Spring! lol
@thatgaytnteen How warm is it there? The high is only 16 here today. HaHa
@bradguyw1995 Agreed! Unfortunately, loneliness is a way of life when you're in the closet. (which I'm hoping I won't be for much longer)
I hate feeling lonely.
@derek_kominars Story of my life! lol
@Dustin_Fincher Exactly, I feel the same, I miss being outside, sunshine makes you feel better about everything.
@Dustin_Fincher I know, it's so cold, I can't wait for Spring!
@mymindwritten I do that sometimes too, wake up, check twitter, go back to sleep. HaHa
@thatgaytnteen Definitely! lol
@thatgaytnteen Not really, kind of pushed my friends away, afraid they'd find out about me. lol
@thatgaytnteen Sorry, I missed seeing this. I've only told people I talk to on here, nobody who I really know personally.
@DanielAcostaMx Thanks, I hope you're right.
@ChiBromoNerd @DanielAcostaMx Kinda afraid of how they'll react, always had a fear that they'll hate me for being gay.
@DanielAcostaMx Thanks. I have definitely considered it, been trying to get the courage to for a while, scary with my homophobic family.
@_Relatable_Gay Aww, thanks so much! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Nobody should feel like they have to hide who they are. I feel like I'm getting so close to telling.
Really starting to feel like the walls are closing in, feeling suffocated &amp; staying in the closet isn't an option, getting tired of hiding.
I really wanna come out soon, so I can get on with my life, and hopefully find a nice boyfriend too. lol
I remember when I was in school, teachers would get pissed and separate the boys and girls, yeah, gotta admit, didn't mind that at all! HaHa
It's way too cold to be single, really wish I had someone to cuddle with right now! lol
@davidianthomas No problem, thanks for following.
Not ashamed to admit that I've been on a pretty serious @britneyspears kick lately! HaHa
Seems fitting to me that Friday the 13th is the day before Valentine's Day this year. HaHa
@archiecomics When is the next @KKellerOfficial comic? I'm hooked, love them!
I'm so cold and tired, I just want someone to cuddle with, until Spring! lol
And a few adults too, immature ones like me. HaHa
.@archiecomics  is my hero for adding a gay character @KKellerOfficial, surprisingly well done, could definitely help some kids struggling.
@aTraviisty There is definitely nothing wrong with the way you look, you're gorgeous!
February, speaking as both, a single guy and a closeted gay, I hate this month! lol
@ben_roark_ben Hey, thanks for the follow back. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@radekandjustin Thanks for the follow back!
The way these girls act around me, makes it really hard to stay in the closet, leave me alone, please!
There is always that one guy who was so wrong for you, yet you can never quite get over him.
@Jpmufti Hey, thanks for following! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I was starting to feel really good about myself after working out, then I had a large order of chilli cheese fries. #TheStruggle HaHa
@BigD_Belch Happy Birthday!
One of my friends really needs to stop suggesting that I simply "pray the gay away" as if that never occurred to me.
The girl at the McDonald's drive through almost came through the window at me, sorry, babe, not interested! HaHa
@homotology Thanks for following!
@sassy_scholar Hey, thanks for the follow back!
@StephenWaltrip Hey, thanks for following back!
@Ash8805 Me too, can't believe I just caught that! HaHa
Yeah, that tweet was obviously supposed to say American Eagle. HaHa
Shout out to America Eagle for sending out junk mail with super hot guys on it! HaHa
Trying to get serious about working out again, so sore right now! lol
@derek_kominars You in that uniform, it's just way too much sexy for me to handle! <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@cois412 Hey, you're welcome! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Pretty good, how is your day?
@MusicMonkey93 Lots of people act like we can just pray the gay away, I tried for a long time, it does not work.
Hugging my pillow extra tight and pretending that it's him.
@FutureDaddy2 Aww, thanks! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
And thanks for the follow back.
@FutureDaddy2 This brought tears to my eyes, I just hope that my sis would respond in a similar way as your bro did, that was beautiful!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I consider music a justifiable expense, it's like therapy, sometimes it's all that gets me through all the pain and sadness.
But she made it through it all and came back better than ever, maybe there's hope for me too! lol
I just realized that Britney Spears was around my age when she started freaking out, I judged her too harshly, I totally get it now!!!
Some of these guys on here are so gorgeous, it just blows my mind, I need a boyfriend like that! lol
@NoNmediocrity Hey, thanks for following and the shout out! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@trav_long You're so gorgeous!!!
Can't believe I'm already at 70 followers, that's so awesome, thanks, everyone!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@jordansammy Thanks for following! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Thanks to everyone who's been there for me, it means so much to me! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Making gay friends definitely helps me feel more confident about all of this.
@itsnickkarcher Hey, thanks for the follow back!
@ClosetBromo I know what you mean, buddy, that's a lot of what I worry about too.
I feel like the words are right on the tip of my tongue, but I fight them back, just two words "I'm gay" amazing how hard it is to say!
I will NOT follow female porn accounts back, they are offensive to my sensitive gay eyes, not interested! lol
Is there anyone I haven't followed back? 
Let me know if I missed you.
Goodnight, guys, thanks for being so awesome.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@bradguyw1995 Hey, thanks for following!
@BrettJSimpson Hey, thanks so much for following back! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I actually think I'm about ready to come out, if my parents would just say something to me, I'm afraid to start the conversation.
@oiCodeRed Hey, thanks for following!

me: "i'm gay"

her: "my parents aren't home"

me : "i'm literally a homosexual"
@brittonclarke That sounds good! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> lol
Currently listening to '1989' for what I assume is at least the 500th time. #MyLife #NoShame HaHa
@life_of_ty1 Definitely!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@life_of_ty1 Thanks for the follow back!
Who can suggest some good, upbeat, fun music?
@BlackLightGay I think nights are the worst, I get so lonely! lol
I swear, I would come out right now if I just had a cute guy to cuddle with. lol
@brittonclarke Keep it up, I enjoy seeing them, cutie! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@brittonclarke Looks to me like your selfie game is always strong! lol
@brittonclarke Oh, wow, yes it is! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I should've replied "You're asking me to come out? OK, if you insist, I like guys!!!" HaHa
Dad just called and asked me to come out... and unload groceries, not the kind of coming out that I'm thinking about, awkward. HaHa
@TyHerndoncom @BillyGilman You guys are amazing, it gave me so much hope when u came out,wanted to congratulate u, now I can, God bless u.<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@Officiallycal Thanks! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> I don't think it will be a whole lot longer, I'm definitely getting there.
@Officiallycal Aww, thanks that would be nice! 
I can't wait to be out so I can finally be free to cuddle and all that good stuff. lol
@TheGayNewYorker Exactly! I've had two of those today, and I'm obviously not interested, I don't wanna see that stuff! HaHa
Why do I keep having to block female porn accounts, what part of GAY do they not understand??? Not interested, AT ALL! HaHa
@ClosetBromo I really am sorry, buddy, I know how hard and scary it can be sometimes. *hugs*
@ClosetBromo Don't hate your life, the fact that you were ready to is a huge step and takes a lot of courage, be patient with yourself.
@BlackLightGay Aww, thanks so much, same to you! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Twitter is amazing, not feeling alone is wonderful, y'all are my whole support team right now, thanks so much for being there for me! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@BlackLightGay I completely understand, I'm in a similar situation, a lot of guys are, it sucks, we should all be free to be who we are!
@BlackLightGay twitter definitely helps, it gives you a voice and helps you reach out to other people and not feel so alone.
@BlackLightGay I feel the same, it's getting harder to stay in the closet, it's getting very stressful lately.
The closet is a very lonely place.
@curiousguyky You're welcome! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@zacharywhittak2 Sorry, it won't let me reply to your DM, because you don't follow me. Will gladly reply if you do.
@zacharywhittak2 Well, if she's any kind of friend, she won't stay mad at you for talking to people. You seem like a really nice guy.
@zacharywhittak2 Oh, that sucks, I'm sorry!
@zacharywhittak2 What's wrong, buddy?
Adults: awww so cute
15 yr old boy: I like a guy in my class
Adults: you'r…
@TheGayNewYorker Hey, thanks for following!
I feel like I've become so much gayer since I made this account, every day, a little more than the day before. It's been fun!!! HaHa
@curiousguyky Don't worry, I'll bet you look super cute with glasses, I love cute guys who wear glasses, it's definitely a plus for me. lol

One day, I will have a cute guy to cuddle with, I promise myself this every night. lol
I look forward to coming out, not having to pretend to not notice when girls throw themselves at me in front of my family, so awkward! HaHa
When I said "bros before hoes" I just REALLY meant it! HaHa
Stupid straight guys, being super cute, but all straight and stuff! #GayGuyProblems lol

@ClosetBromo I definitely know how you're feeling, best luck to you, hope it goes well.
@ClosetBromo Good for you! I also feel like I'm getting to that point, can't wait to finally be able to tell the truth.
Wish I had a pic of myself kissing a cute guy, would be so awesome to come out while these people are so busy gay bashing! HaHa
FB is full of homophobic rants right now. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@nobfhere Aww, thanks! And you're welcome. lol
I feel loved now! HaHa RT"@chrisvan899: @ClosetGayGuy_ did you see that he just gave us away lol"

Right now, I'd just like a cute guy to cuddle with me.
Why don't I have a girlfriend? Um, probably because I'm into dudes! HaHa #ClosetGayGuyProblems
