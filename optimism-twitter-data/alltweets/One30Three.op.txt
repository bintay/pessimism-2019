@GreenLanternJet yup fiyafightah
@GreenLanternJet @fiyafightah one of my favorite fights ever was Zab Judah vs Kostya tszyu -Judah got hit so hard he did the james brown lol
@fiyafightah boxing is a fraternity - at the boxing gym I train at everyone has a story - nothing like it
@GreenLanternJet the shit he put on his gloves???  I remember that like it was yesterday @fiyafightah
@fiyafightah yes sir - Ray *Boom Boom* Mancini vs Duk Koo Kim
@NickSpano What does bill drink on a hot Humid summer day RT 4 a scolding small hot coffee from DD-FAV for iced coffee like a normal person

Damn - you need to take out a second mortgage just to buy Mother's Day cards - didn't these things used to be a $1?
@damienwoody got walking pneumonia - home chilling with my pit and chihuahua - mom dukes came by and sends her love
@CLoprestiWFAN truth - that was a Rex pick all the way so I can bet the farm he will look better
@uSTADIUM did they ever find the small fridge that #BTCSBPOSDHCINDWU ???

One of the worst days of my life - my heart bleeds for you

@Ryan_Alfieri no they will tell you before every blop of it
@LilMissNYJet @DrewfromJersey still high from it but trying to stay realistic - we need a perfect game at Bernabéu

@NYJ1979 I just want Chiellini to bite Suarez then I'm good
My greatest futbol moment ever occurred in Berlin, Germany 2006 when #ITA won the World Cup, love for #Juve to see Berlin for the #UCL final
#ITA vs Portugal 6/16/15 in Geneva - "friendly" @DrewfromJersey @LilMissNYJet

Back to the gym - round 2 - hope everyone is enjoying their Sunday #Jets #nyj #Isles #Yankees
Welcome to my city  
@GreenLanternJet can't really judge until Ridley is healthy - but I agree squeeze the ball
@MMehtaNYDN great line about Tanny not even giving the player a chance to sit before cutting him, I believe it was the backup QB from NE

Back home from vacation = two-a-days at the gym, AM cardio in, back day later on

Bowles a die hard #Yankees fan - nice #Jets #nyj

@applesiderr <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
#TheStruggle “@applesiderr: Also, it's the day I realize how pale I am.”
@SJD10304 @SeanLDurham @jetswhispers but again it is just my opinion
“@SJD10304: @SeanLDurham @jetswhispers nope. Some #Jets fans call it like it is - both he and Geno are below average QB's.” Have 2 agree
@L7Panda exactly
@L7Panda I can bring the horse to water, you have to make it drink
@peace_n_addy exactly the way it should be, put in that work
@L7Panda decent
@L7Panda indeed
@L7Panda it's three things in one package, hence gifts

Day 1 notes- 
@Peaches275 ohh you really are there, nice - I'm in Mexico
#Snacks “@domcosentino: Jets NT Damon Harrison said he signed his RFA tender ($2.356M) earlier this week.”
@Peaches275 interesting
@Peaches275 before 1 pm??
@SeanLDurham lmao
It's cause I'm olive skinned right? “@SeanLDurham: Except no one likes you 
I believe I own Brooklyn - comparable statement “@SethWalderNYDN: Geno Smith: "I believe this is my team."” #nyj #Jets
@DrewfromJersey @yankey4eva I only noted Justin Houston as a comparison due to weed and potential-Grefory needs to add to that frame in #NFL
@DrewfromJersey agreed @yankey4eva
@BigRedDiva greetings from Mexico 
@yankey4eva @DrewfromJersey I would be, I think Drew would be as well - Drew screamed for Justin Houston back in the day but "weed" smh
@DrewfromJersey Fowler gone it is Scherff or Gregory IMO- question is it Gregory at 6 or lower due to "off field issues" see Justin Houston
Please do “@SeanLDurham: Go to sleep 
@fiyafightah word? You feeling ok?
@BigRedDiva word

@Trishie_11 @DrewfromJersey this can be done
The #Jets should make the tampering check of 100k 2 the estate of Leon Hess as a credit against the 1 million Bellichick stole from him #nyj
@Judetruth so did Sanchez - point?
@GoGetMyCoffee @DrewfromJersey Back in the day only 2 Oriundi per team hence all Italian players-stressed the youth leagues and development
@GoGetMyCoffee I hope it's on the come up with the new stadium projects and Juve in UCL semis and Fior and Nap in Euro semis
“@_EricJon: I may be  crashing opening day this year  @DrewfromJersey @One30Three” cool I need someone to watch the grill while I socialize
@GoGetMyCoffee always be remembered for World Cup, 06 despite recovering from injury &amp; like Del Piero being a 1 team guy (ADP pushed out)

@rattnjets I hope so plus the cat they signed from Seattle - I love fowler, Scherff at 6 - only think Fowler is gone by then - trade back?
@AlanLern @Chris_Imbemba Alan it will be a quad celebration 1) u 2) Chris's test 3) @Tespo16 bout to have a baby and 4) my 1 yr anniversary
@Chris_Imbemba @AlanLern he has to he brings the wings
@rattnjets he would be plug and go between brick and mangold and with these shit qb's we need a brick wall
@rattnjets prospects yes, look at the grades people like Kiper &amp; McShay are giving Scherff (Just as a reference - their opinions 2) 1 of 2
@NicoleBattaglia @SeanLDurham my wife is Sicilian - "In Sicily the women are more deadly than a shotgun" ~ The Godfather
@AlanLern @Chris_Imbemba my man
I told you I'm not white I'm Italian “@SeanLDurham: Just remember that I hate all of you”
Where has @AngelaPerfetto9 been?
@rattnjets IMO it is - opinions r a beautiful thing you don't have to justify them - only other guy I take IF he's there is Fowler
“@NYJ_NDN: @One30Three Oh...CALI?” Respect for that one bro
Yo @Chris_Imbemba take down this information, flight 504, leaving Kennedy, going to LAX #GetThisPaper

The #Isles power-play is dog sh*t, plain and simple
“@SeanLDurham: Jets draft Mariota @ 6 how confident r you that Mariota beats Geno out in a fair QB comp?” Does it include popping n locking?
@HansTalksNFL @DrewfromJersey @_keator Drew made my point lol
@Espo4710 @DrewfromJersey I'm on board with OL/OLB, believe with the the QB's we have now OL is paramount
Remember when Gholston's nuts dropped when he fought Rob Turner ?? #Jets
@peace_n_addy @fiyafightah glad that game is over for me
@DrewfromJersey agreed
@sarahbuchhofer what shit
@DrewfromJersey It all comes down to the mental acuity - he is a better athlete than Sanchez but valid points
@Espo4710 well said

@TeamThirstTrap I remember the day my dad came home from work and told me he had HIV - had his poster right above my bed
1 of ur boys gets jumped &amp; it's time to put in work, u call a few of ur boys to handle ur business.  Willie Colon is 1 that is called #nyj

@NYJ1979 I bounced at a few spots in college - China club, Boulevard, etc. - been sucker-punched many a time lol
@NYJ1979 never got knocked out cold though - won many more than I lost but it's part of the game
@NYJ1979 lol
@NYJ1979 my dad witnessed mine - was fighting a dude who had at least 4 " and 40 lbs on me, was 15, caught me,I started walking in a circle
#Random - if you have never been punched in the face, don't talk to me about who is tough or who is weak - save that shit for the trolls

Today in 2010 I banged dirty Diana “@TheLaunchMag: Today in 1988, Michael Jackson drops "Dirty Diana" the 5th single from the "Bad" album."
@DWAZ73 @yankey4eva you hit all 3 I was thinking of lol
“@DWAZ73: Breaking: Everyone with a car is apparently on the Gowanus Expressway at the moment. Brutal.” Top 3 worst roadways anywhere
#TheStruggle  “@Pr_Playman: I'm communist.”
@NYJ_Henry @Ryan_Alfieri I'm renaming myself hashtag or dash

@StephLauren actually I let the games play and worry about my next opponent when that moment arrives, call me the odd man out
The way I look at it is we let a road W get away, no positives about any part of tonight to me - let's see if we can hold a lead in Nassau
“@StephLauren: Good, Isles and Caps. Tire the hell out of each other in a long, long series. Gooooooood.” Karma is such a bitch
Any chance @GreenLanternJet can back to the WFAN bathroom?? #Isles

My man @Revis24 - telling it like it is - welcome home fam #nyj #Jets

@L7_Tailgate @jesssica_brooke Jess you coming to the home opener??
Agreed “@DrewfromJersey: @TurnOnTheJets Overall the 2008 team could have and should have been the best team most fans have seen here #Jets”
@AlyseZwick @GameOfThrones here is one for ya that I thought was creative lol 
@TurnOnTheJets the 82 &amp; 86 Jets were talent laden and could have won it all - injuries took their toll in 86 and Shula’s no tarp in 1/1983

@L7_Tailgate I don’t care who it is, just give me good weather, my L7 fam and a good product on the field
