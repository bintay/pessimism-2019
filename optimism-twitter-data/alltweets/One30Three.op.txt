@L7Panda interesting - I hope you both survive lol @JoeCarlson36
@fiyafightah my dad was on the flow laughing that night - he got knocked down,popped up, did the James Brown and went down @GreenLanternJet
@fiyafightah stick with it my man - you wouldn't believe how nice you can get with your hands - and it is the best overall workout imo
@GreenLanternJet yup fiyafightah
@GreenLanternJet @fiyafightah one of my favorite fights ever was Zab Judah vs Kostya tszyu -Judah got hit so hard he did the james brown lol
@fiyafightah boxing is a fraternity - at the boxing gym I train at everyone has a story - nothing like it
@GreenLanternJet the shit he put on his gloves???  I remember that like it was yesterday @fiyafightah
@fiyafightah yes sir - Ray *Boom Boom* Mancini vs Duk Koo Kim
@NickSpano What does bill drink on a hot Humid summer day RT 4 a scolding small hot coffee from DD-FAV for iced coffee like a normal person
@fiyafightah I am starting to learn about the old timers now - Joe Louis, Marciano, Willie Pep, Sugar Ray Robinson, etc.  learned a lot
@JoeCarlson36 Hi Joe, Hi Joe  @L7Panda
@fiyafightah so many great fighters bro- be a true student of the game, Hagler, Hearns, Holmes, Foreman, Norton &amp; on &amp; on - I love the sport
@damienwoody there is a need for honest former athletes to guide some of these kids - this documentary blew my mind
Bart Scott cashed his first #NFL check at a check cashing joint lol... damn #ESPN #nyj #30For30
@damienwoody you ever see the 30 for 30 documentary "Broke" ??  I wonder who the good voices in these rookies ears are now a days?

@RealMetman I miss the old days - pizza, cards, etc all one dollar lol
Damn - you need to take out a second mortgage just to buy Mother's Day cards - didn't these things used to be a $1?
@damienwoody got walking pneumonia - home chilling with my pit and chihuahua - mom dukes came by and sends her love
@CLoprestiWFAN truth - that was a Rex pick all the way so I can bet the farm he will look better
@uSTADIUM did they ever find the small fridge that #BTCSBPOSDHCINDWU ???
@CLoprestiWFAN bet you the first drink at local FP spot Petty looks better than Boyd out of the gate - honor system here lol
One of the worst days of my life - my heart bleeds for you 
@Pr_Playman I appreciate that one bro

Fine them and move on - Brady is still a top 5 all time QB, he tried to get an edge - own up to it and that's that #NFL #DeflateGate
@Ryan_Alfieri no they will tell you before every blop of it
@LilMissNYJet @DrewfromJersey still high from it but trying to stay realistic - we need a perfect game at BernabÃ©u
@LilMissNYJet @DrewfromJersey good luck today Deb
@NYJ1979 I just want Chiellini to bite Suarez then I'm good
My greatest futbol moment ever occurred in Berlin, Germany 2006 when #ITA won the World Cup, love for #Juve to see Berlin for the #UCL final
#ITA vs Portugal 6/16/15 in Geneva - "friendly" @DrewfromJersey @LilMissNYJet
The strong will survive. The others will fall off. And we'll keep going.

Back to the gym - round 2 - hope everyone is enjoying their Sunday #Jets #nyj #Isles #Yankees
Welcome to my city  
@GreenLanternJet can't really judge until Ridley is healthy - but I agree squeeze the ball
@MMehtaNYDN great line about Tanny not even giving the player a chance to sit before cutting him, I believe it was the backup QB from NE
@DJSWHiT Ma$e
Back home from vacation = two-a-days at the gym, AM cardio in, back day later on
C'mon Pac!!

@DrewfromJersey @yankey4eva I only noted Justin Houston as a comparison due to weed and potential-Grefory needs to add to that frame in #NFL
@DrewfromJersey agreed @yankey4eva
@BigRedDiva greetings from Mexico 
@yankey4eva @DrewfromJersey I would be, I think Drew would be as well - Drew screamed for Justin Houston back in the day but "weed" smh
@DrewfromJersey Fowler gone it is Scherff or Gregory IMO- question is it Gregory at 6 or lower due to "off field issues" see Justin Houston
Please do â@SeanLDurham: Go to sleep
