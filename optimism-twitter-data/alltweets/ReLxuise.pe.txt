This Jeremih, @chancetherapper &amp; @Lidogotsongs collab. yeah.
&amp; I feel like some one else deserves to experience me in that capacity, because I love from my soul. point blank period.
#Truthfully The only reason I deal with the whole "relationship" thing is because I've placed a value on my companionship
we were too careful to be real with each other like we needed to be for us to have a healthy relationship
We were honest, but not on some #bewithyouforever honesty. We had the #walkingOnEggShells honesty.
but if you're making a mortgage investment and he's just trying to rent a room for the night, Chile welcome to the Heartbreak HOE-tel
if both man and woman are honest about their intentions no one gets hurt on purpose.
See these days the best way to avoid broken hearts and emotional turmoil is HONESTY
that mortgage investment.. 
until they find something worth "renting to own" and even then they wont fully give in to that investment because they like "Options"
men "rent".
women invest in men with hope of future positive repercussions. its like real estate.
but If the body and the mind don't align, then I ain't got time.
Visually, he was everything that I wanted.
Well, on one hand I'm kind of glad things went down the way they did.

@ImAveryWilson Congrats on everthing at @RCARecords
but seriously...
I have a fear of finding companionship in someone who's just as emotionally in touch with themselves/the world as I am
but if it works out, that could be terrifying too
Nothing better than artistic revenge on a love lost
That could either end up being a beautiful reality or an artistic ( bloodbath ) nightmare.
I wonder what it would be like to love another creative soul...
I need to release all of these creative energies
I just wanna lock myself in the studio for 72 hours.

I'm coming with the heat next week for #SoulSundays
I've been buying music a whole lot lately
I respect people who do the same for me.

And then on your end you just don't know how unwrap what you're being given.
I'm trying to show you my feelings are growing without having to say that, because it's not that strong yet.
I'm not one to jump out &amp; just be like " I love you "
I've sent songs, poems, ect... And you still don't get that all of it is either about you and how you make me feel or its for you.
But I romance normal MF's with art &amp; they don't get it.

People don't understand that if you have a gift &amp; know God no matter what genre you sing it can be a spiritual experience
Luke James Changed My Outlook on Life after seeing him in concert.
I have such a deep appreciation for performance art. It changes lives.
There's just something about seeing/feeling a person leave their heart on stage.

#ShutUpAndLove
And I say 'do' because love is not just an indescribable feeling, it's a verb hoe!
That's all that love is... If you understood you wouldn't have to ask IF, anything! . You would know because I already do.
If you understood you wouldn't have to ask.
4 Days Till NYC
Because we give up so much personal information in our music, the world knows just as much if not more then you do as a significant other
And when you date an artist... You're kinda sharing with the world.
We don't get to devote as much time to significant others because we are so dedicated to handling and nurturing our art with care
We can be in love with someone and open up wounds from past relationships through our art.
That's why relationships sometimes aren't the best with us.
'Being an artist is complicated.'

I'm a Business, (wo)Man!
That talk was pointless
Im not asking for much
Nothing wrong with wanting/needing to be loved on every once in awhile.
Love is the answer and key.
I just wanna be spoiled with love
Being selfless is one of the things I pride myself on, but every one deserves to spoil them selves. Mentally &amp; spiritually
I'm not going to stop caring. Simply just care for myself  in the same capacity as I do others
@olazacc4 and + you can only give out so many pieces of your mind until you have no peace of mind within yourself.
@olazacc4 I don't think about me often at all. Sometimes caring for others can be Scrrrresfull
I care too much about others and their well being
Haha we'll see how this goes.
Imma leave that alone until I go back to ATL
Fxvking Young
But it's not gonna happen anyway lol

I've learned that age is really not a factor in relationships

You Got To Be Dead Red || Amazing Night 
The truth about me 
Praise the Lord for new beginnings
TF are you?
Who
If God before me.
and I'm off
No one can work as hard as you because everybody has a different work ethic, but now that it's an even field it's all about accomplishments
Get over yourself and walk in your destiny stop being afraid to be great
Either You don't think you're going to succeed, don't want to see somebody else succeed, or you think the person who is succeeding cheated
Because success is becoming such a negative thing
But I don't feel like anybody has ever not been afraid of success.
I've never been afraid to learn from a mistake
I don't believe people fail they learn from what they do wrong.
There are some people who are not afraid to fail.
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who's not afraid of succeeding.
I just know. Ya know.
I somehow always end up speaking up or thinking up things that are going to happen because I feel it in my soul.
I have a gift of intuition. I've had it ever since I was child.
I don't think about things logically I'll  admit that, because there's nothing logical about the things that I've seen God do in my life.
Sometimes you have to go insane to out sane the "sane"
But have you ever felt so crazy that it was almost like you were the only sane one in the room.
I've never felt so crazy in my life.
I'm in a strange place in my life dealing with some things I've never had to deal with. With people, with school, with music.
The only reason I'm taking it is because I know God is going to catch me.
Is it just so hard to want to take a leap of faith?
I have an unsolicited amount of confidence, but not in myself, in the work that I know that God is doing in me
Message! That was confirmation.
Stop being Afraid to Succeed and walk in your destiny.
You make dumb decisions listening to folk vs. God. Ha!
I will not allow impossibilities to dictate my final destination.
I'm going because I'm bold enough to know where I'm going to be. I'm just walking in it.
I need to go to that event.
Even though it doesn't look like I can get it, I'm the one who's gonna have it.
It's not about the "if" it's about the "how"
Trust in God
Deal with God because God is limitless.
When dealing with human beings you are subject to fail because humans have limits
I'm really not difficult. I'm just very particular about what I want for my music.
easy to see through, hard to break down.
I'm the most transparent brick ever.
my face and my body language can be saying what i really mean
To work WITH you
You just need the right people.
Anything is possible.
My emotions rule my soul.
I'm Just gonna trust God with it.
bad timing maybe?
But you can't force a star into a square hole
And I know it seems like my patience runs a little thin.
Sometimes I feel like the world thinks I'm crazy

Thank God for warning signs!
That was confirmation
Man what?
My heart just fell into my stomach
Second opinion brought confirmation
Don't let anybody tell you that your dream isn't possible
People tell you you can't do it, do you should just stay in the background, keep writing songs
It took me to a whole other place of emotion because I'm living it
It's one thing to talk about it but when you're living in it .....
When he gave his testimony... That just broke me
Just keep moving forward. Even if you're scared.
@aafmericaan thanks for the love<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è I appreciate that
Perfect Peace
Pray God keeps you.
Certain things can trigger you down a bad path
there are some people in my life who know how to bring out the worst in me and they don't even know it. even they've seen it.
everyone has baggage. you pick and choose,and just hope you don't end up triggering the worst of it.
whats the point in talking to a brick wall at the end of the day if you try to knock it down you're going to need heavy equipment.
And that wall can mess people up when they dont know what type of hard S**t built it
I admit I sometimes catch my self putting up a defensive wall when I feel I'm being done wrong
never let your past dictate your future
I just need a break!
Might as well get a early start on the weekend I don't have Friday classes and I was just going to be doing homework until Sunday anyway.

That's crazy yo
I needed that <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I've been having these themed dreams about the same person for like 2 months now
I don't know about my dreams anymore. All that I know is I'm falling
Now. Back to the music
I just call them Happy Accidents
it is at that point when it is no longer a failure it's just a lesson because you're not being judged to learn  from your "Mistakes"
You stop failing when you stop trying to please others
I stopped depending on "next time" people and started doing it myself now!
Taking matters into my own hands sort of
I'm not completely oblivious to whats going on but we're treating this as a reemergence
I understand the incubating process but there are somethings you need to take into consideration
Its a labor of love
Building a fan base
Hmm.
Taking time to watch the sunrise.
I haven't been feeling like myself lately.
Let me get back to packing
But what do I know I'm just another young na√Øve person with an opinion Right? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I truly believe that I can have all of the desires of my heart: 1. A Career 2. A Degree 3. A Family &amp; 4. Comfort
Or should I say do not let anybody convince
No matter how blessed you are at what you do don't let anybody tell you you should drop out of school
So my degree is my way of being twice as good
But you have to be twice as good to get half of that in respect
There was a point in my life where I didn't think it was possible for me to do both...
I'm getting this degree to prove a point
Although I appreciate their generous comments...
Or that I'm going to be one of those people who ends up not finish soon because I'm "talented"
I've met a lot of people who have told me that I don't have to go to college

ATL this weekend
That's a blessing &amp; a curse
I'm just so in touch with my feelings.
Oh the wonders of being a young woman
Because I'm afraid of the effects it will have on me in the end
I guess that's because I'm one of those people who talks about skydiving but I'm not doing it unless somebody pushes me out of the plane.
Why did I let someone talk me into calling you
So if I do decide to finally take that chance I'll be prepared for the worst
But I kinda mentally already gave myself a "No"
It has to be obvious
Maybe you're just one of those people that just don't get the hint
When people know you exist, but they don't notice you
Whoever Is producing these songs for Mike Jay...... Man Thank You
I've been having trouble piecing things together lately
Love Everybody! Befriend Few.
The really scary thing with me is, I'm not who I was last month, I know who I am now, but not who I'm going to be in another month.
I'm evolving rather quickly in mindset
And now I am really trying to fix it to make it look like what I see as myself now versus who I was
And every mistake I made on my portrait is fixable
I feel like I'm a real freaky looking self portrait.
I'm at this point in life

But I'm OKAY Because it's not like pain stops you from smiling. #MatterOfFact Isn't than one of the reasons to smile .......to hide pain?
I've Gotten used to hiding behind a persona that I can't take away, I have been hurt so much that it's my way of masking the pain
#Truth I'm the Fake-ist Person you will ever meet and will tell you that up front.
I think about everything I do. Stuff I Say,Type,Sing,even the things I don't do. Whatever  you act on there is always a reason and a motive.
