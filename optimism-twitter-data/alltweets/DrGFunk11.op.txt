@yhufnagel you have no clue how happy I am to be a Cal alum! Always have been but really optimistic for the upcoming season
Save of the Playoffs? #StanleyCup 
@Espngreeny can we get some hockey commentary???
@Dave_Stubbs not Brad Watson, eh?
@emanperez14 now I have to keep refreshing the search feed for "Caleb Swanigan"
@ADCalBears Congrats on the promotion! Good luck with everything! #GOBEARS
@RGBearTerritory @AGuyNamedNam @CuonzoMartin @CalMensBBall Yes! Let me know when so I can fly back to @Cal!
@CuonzoMartin You have no idea how excited I am about the upcoming season! Always loved my time @ Cal and proud to be an alum! #donor4life
@yhufnagel @FCHWPO solid work to the staff! I'm so happy he values academics @Cal...a true Golden Bear!
@Real_ESPNLeBrun combined with the anemic Montreal PP
@CanadiensMTL subban! #1sthabsgoal
@GottliebShow Mayweather will get a few more unanimous decisions...with juries
@MichelleDBeadle Juries have also given Mayweather a unanimous decision!
@J4hvidbest Juries have also given Mayweather a unanimous decision
@Real_ESPNLeBrun bring on Habs-Bolts later today! More action
Look how @optimum reacts when I tell them my Mayweather fight pixelates! 
#MayPac
@stephenasmith @FloydMayweather he should pretend he's fighting one of his girlfriends
@Deadspin Reggie miller was def the drunkest
@OptimumHelp I want a credit. I can't watch the HD version
@OptimumHelp I did all of that. I spoke to 2 reps. Still pixelated on HD version. This is really poor for 90 dollar cowt
@darrenrovell no audio on @optimum
@darrenrovell @CollegeHoopNews thanks @optimum for having a pixelated signal with no resolution after 2 calls
@GottliebShow figuring out how to see fight without paying for floyds lifestyle
@stephenasmith spell his name right bro. He's not the domestic violence convict
@Kelsey_Butler44 grade inflation. Easy reason why. UNC type of classes
@AGuyNamedNam and it's a PS3 for life? So now that ps4 is out, is that apocalypse for him?
@1bigukcat @eamonnbrennan yeah. Ok.
@CuonzoMartin thank you.
@eamonnbrennan time to re-revise your way to early top-25. Cal has to be in the top 10 now! #GoBears
@Kelsey_Butler44 and the UK "students" do?
@AGuyNamedNam @Parcelman18 2 things that Cal students can brag about that UK students can't...Nobel laureate profs and a full set of teeth
@GoodmanESPN @GoldenBlogs speaks highly of the job Cuonzo is doing. Top to re-revise the way too early top-25 rankings
NUMBER ONE SCHOOL

IT WAS DESTINY
I am DEFINITELY getting tickets to see the @CalMensBBall play at Haas this year! #GoBears
@GoldenBlogs Congrats to Coach @CuonzoMartin and Coach @yhufnagel ! You guys should be proud to have the BEST recruiting class in the USA!
@FCHWPO you have chosen a university with the BEST academics that will challenge you and allow you to pursue all dreams including the NBA
Holy shit!!! Jaylen Brown going to Cal!
@Real_ESPNLeBrun no goal Pierre. Cmon man
@GoldenBlogs close sources to Jaylen Brown say he has made a decision between bottled, tap, and sparkling water...he picks sparkling! #h2o
@glove who can I contact about hiring your professional guitaring and vocal abilities for our wedding? That would be so awesome #I-76
@glove We haven't picked anyone to play the ceremony yet. That would be the best ever!!!!
@glove how about our wedding in Spring Lake, NJ this coming September?
@theScore price has got to win
@SportsCenter @MichaelRapaport incorrect spelling of pacquiao
@Tysonjolly because that hard challenge will lead to success and the experience you have at @cal will prepare you for anything in the future

@ErinAndrews how hard are your PR people working now on separating you from Jarret using coke and E? #badrolemodel
@jarretstoll blowing lines of coke should not be on the #SCtop10
The @PKSubban1 slapshot last night should be on the #SCtop10
@espn you guys should be ashamed having someone like her working for you #firebrittmchenry
@BrittMcHenry very shameful! You'll need some plastic surgery soon so start saving those pennies! #firebrittmchenry
@IamAaronGordon too bad you didn't go to Cal and too bad you didn't stay an extra year in college
@bennyreid hell yeah bro

@YoungIvee @Tysonjolly @DDillard24 My fiancée and I decided we are flying out from NJ to watch you guys play this year! #GoBears
@Tysonjolly Hey bro...lookin forward to you being a Golden Bear, but it's spelled Berkeley (you got it wrong on you profile) #justlookinout
@YoungIvee it's snowing pac-12 and ncaa championships? Yes it is! After you committed to @cal last night.
@_austinchang @GoldenBlogs agreed. Maybe they should get degree from university of Phoenix instead #educationnotvocation
@Lilmac_43 @DDillard24 @YoungIvee @FCHWPO and keep @T_Wa1l too!
@T_Wa1l you gotta stay bro! We need you for another championship. 1959 is too long! #gobears
@emanperez14 roll on you Bears!
@CuonzoMartin Now Jaylen Brown!!! #gobears
@CuonzoMartin you're the best Coach! Go celebrate!
Best Day Ever! @YoungIvee welcome bro! #gobears
@GoldenBlogs this is sooooo much more interesting than politicians announcing they're running for president #RabbidCalFans
@GoldenBlogs Is the #RabbWatch televised, or do I have to keep swiping down to refresh my Twitter feed? #sorethumbs
@Tysonjolly @CalRivals Congrats!! Well deserved!
@YoungIvee Literally, I can't stop searching your name hoping you'll choose @Cal! Would make me so proud to call you a fellow Golden Bear!
@CuonzoMartin @CalMensBBall Hope you're getting the locker room expanded for Rabb, Swanigan, and Brown! #gobears
@Biggs_Swanigan @GoldenBlogs Hoping CALeb Swanigan chooses Cal! He has CAL in his name! #gobears #bigthree
@MikeAndMike Sam Dekker is Keith Van Horn!
@espngolic Sam Dekker is Keith Van Horn!
@Espngreeny Sam Dekker is Keith Van Horn!
Hope tonight inspires @YoungIvee to bring @CalMensBBall home a championship next year! #GoBears
@RealJayWilliams a different type of racism that's also unacceptable
@RealJayWilliams except Andrew Harrison. Very poor form and class. He should think about how to conduct himself and respect others
I used to have respect for @DrewRoc5 before, but now I have none #dirtbag #racist
@GoldenBlogs I don't know how many times I can keep checking... 
@GoldenBlogs game is hard to watch but even harder when it's not on mute #silenceWalton

@GoldenBearVlad @GoldenBlogs maybe they can rely on Shantay as coach. Ran into him while he was at Cal. Not a nice dude at all! Glad he left
@lindzcatharine @GoldenBlogs I actually made 4 free throws at MSG once in a 15 second contest
@GottliebShow Reggie bush? #10peoplewhodidntvoteforMariota

@GoldenBlogs @DickieV hangin out with Mr. Vitale himself! 
@CalMensBBall they can do this! I've lost my voice but I'm still going nuts!

@GoldenBlogs we got an education not a vocation! #GoBears

Great article about @ryananderson33 After going through tragedy, he shares what he learned #standupguy #calbears  
They shouldn't allow those idiots at @NESN to broadcast anymore. I've heard them say "get up" to an injured player in the past
The announcers on @NESN are the most biased jerks! I hope the @CanadiensMTL destroy the Bruins and those fools can eat their words #GoHabsGo
@GoldenBlogs Remember when Cal beat SC and Tyler Fredrickson hit the 53-yard field goal to send it into OT? #calpride #GoBears

@jimchap we had a blast. Can't wait to catch up again soon! How was your b'way show?
@Real_ESPNLeBrun As much as I'm a @CanadiensMTL fan, the bruins are playing pretty well against the leafs. I'd hate to face them next

@kodoyle awesome man. I've driven past it. Looks amazing! I do come up on some weekends. We should figure out some time to hit up G Hill
@espn Stuartscottandthetwofirstnames #DerbyHorseName
@kodoyle why aren't you following me Doyle? I'm moving back to the area in August. We will have to golf it up!

@CSNPhilly Worst broadcasters ever in Philly! #flyerstalk
@CSNPhilly You guys truly are the WORST broadcasters. The @AGally94 boarding was just like how @BGALLY17 got hit earlier. #worstbroadcasters
@CSNPhilly See? The flyers play dirty. Another deserved penalty
@CSNPhilly Maybe they can broadcast the flyers playing golf when they don't make the playoffs!
@CSNPhilly Are the broadcasters moving up from high school hockey? #worstbroadcasters
@CSNPhilly Your broadcast team is the worst in the NHL! You shouldn't be partial and take sides! @BGALLY17 got boarded and that's the truth!
@SpikeLee agree...u should do 30 for 30 about @OptimusCope ... He is the man and from NJ! #bleedsorangeandblue 
@Espngreeny It depends on where the fracture is. Also the type of fracture as well. He'll probably be out a few months including his rehab.
@Espngreeny Greinke will prob need surgery with a plate and screws. It allows for faster recovery. I'm an ortho surgeon.
@BrandonPrust8 Can I get a follow for cheering for you in Philly, where 3 fans told me to shut up? Goin to see you again in 2 weeks vs NJ!
@diaz_raphael_61 Can I get a follow from one of your fav fans?
