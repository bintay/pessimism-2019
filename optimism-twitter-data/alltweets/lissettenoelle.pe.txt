fall in love with yourself because one day you're going to be the only one you've got
everyone should realize that girls also take nudes when they feel good about themselves not just to send them to people
a "beach body" is anyone wearing a bathing suit, that is all
there's no such thing as a "beach body"
pointing out that someone is skinny repeatedly is rude because you don't know if they're content with their body, ya feel?

sephora is actually my home

too lazy to enroll for my college class
@audreyelizaa that contour <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
tell all your pets hi from me
can i be 5'8 please
@lissettenoelle if you've ever been on the receiving end of a comment like that, please block that person out of your life, they are no good
@lissettenoelle and if you've ever said this to anyone then please slap urself w a brick, thanks
"good thing you don't eat, then i won't have to spend money on taking you out to eat" is the most cruel thing you can say to anyone w an ed
confident and cocky are two different things
i'm actually obsessed w @MannyMua733 <SPARKLING HEART><SPARKLES>
we never change, do we? we never learn, do we?
i wanna live life, never be cruel, i wanna live life, be good to you.
i hate my hair, i'm going to shave my head bye

do you ever just forget how to walk when an attractive person is walking behind you?
i just noticed you can spell tounge and tongue to different ways apparently ???
@scvmbxg really? i just don't want to get it just because i've only heard bad experiences about tongue piercings
wanting to get my tounge pierced but fuck thattttt
i am seriously so fuckin bored someone entertain me

it took so much effort to get up and get my laptop charger, i am actually out of breath
babeeeeeee 
why did you run away or was it home that ran away from you? you said that you would stay.
my cousin once wanted me to push her in front of a coca-cola truck so she can sue
in this heart space i feel perpetual grace and through time we will both survive
i'm such a hopeless romantic, i fucking hate it
if you get me upset, be prepared to get your emojis taken off your contact
i don't care if you live in a different state/country, if i like you &amp; you like me i will make an effort to come see you &amp; i hope you do too
i hate not watching a band at a show bc i don't know them, then becoming obsessed w them months later???
@lovelylyssa happy birthday angel <BABY ANGEL>üèª<TWO HEARTS>
it irritates me so much that people call kim's photo album a "book"

i don't know why people don't take me seriously when i say i want to raise 20 dogs, like i'm being dead serious wtf

i just gave myself a paper cut and now i want 2 cry
@Cattdoodle YASSSS

alpacas and llamas scare the living crap out of me
@trevorthemighty <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>üèª

tumblr is actually an obsession and i need help
in need of a cute boy to love me
plants r cool!!
so i put on my pj's backwards
you shouldn't try to weigh as much as you did when you were in 12
when you see someone trying to act drunk when they barely took a sip of their beer
pls don't hate yourselves, you're all lovely little babes
i had dinner by myself at a restaurant, it was awesome yet pretty sad
i followed a cat yesterday for 20 minutes into a random field just bc i wanted to pet it, i call that dedication
SAM e 
i just spilled tea on my chest, and my only question is why do bad things happen to bad people?
GIRLS ARE SO PRETTY, IT FRUSTRATES M E
i hate when u see a cute guy at work but your busy taking care of a customer and he walks out before you can even ask if he needs help
people who reply a month later bo ther m E
don't be a dick <RELIEVED FACE>
@lissettenoelle and that makes me truly sad
i've never had a "best friend"
@le_karenn just overthinking again and thinking about all the negative things
life is enjoyed in the simplicity, the natural beauty of nature and emotion
@le_karenn i'm trying! i was good this whole past week
i'm getting bad again
this is ridiculous, hahahahahaha
watching clueless <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

@Cattdoodle i do <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
i envy people who can sleep anywhere
i let so many people take advantage of me because i‚Äôd rather have their company fuck me up mentally than not have it at all
i hate that anxious feeling of waiting for a package
wendy pisses me off 
you incredibly illiterate dumb fuck
you say "love isn't jealous" yet that's all you were. JEALOUS
@lissettenoelle we are a package deal
if i ever date you, you're going to have to accept my child caleb
caleb is my hamster and i love him to death
my hamster caleb, gets shy and stops exercising when people stare at him and i think he gets that trait from me :~)
it's 10pm and i want starbucks
i think a race car just sped through my neighborhood
@taylorndean you guys are the cutest couple!!
my body feels not so heavy?? wtf

@ramsesortega_ yes!

this is so important 
take me to see defeater as a first date

ok so wear less makeup, tf does that have to do with me
lol u have no potential
that amazing feeling of hopping into bed after a nice warm shower is the best
don't fucking talk about people behind their backs, have some fucking manners
literally, i don't get why people are hating on kylie jenner, she's lookin hella fine doing her thing and making bank at the same time <NAIL POLISH>üèª
i said an outfit on a display looked cute and my friend said, "that's very coachella of u"
me at a pet store: hi... um..yes i'd like to buy 20 of your finest puppies
my friend and i call nudes, "tumblr pics"
honestly, 90% of the reason why i don't take selfies is bc i'm so fucking lazy to get up
girls are hot and i'm not ashamed to admit that
i'm so thankful to have the people i have in my life <SPARKLING HEART><DOG FACE><SPARKLING HEART>
getting no message is also a message
<CHERRY BLOSSOM> i want to drink only smoothies for the rest of my life <CHERRY BLOSSOM>

actually glad i'm not in a relationship with you, haha
dying my hair at the end of this week!
i want to feel body positive, but i seriously can't do that when i'm surrounded by people who criticize my body all the fucking time
some people think they can just say whatever they want, think again bitch
if you're in a relationship with a person who is messing with your mind and making you question your sanity, that is emotional abuse.
@ramsesortega_ thank you so much!
it's friday night and all i'm doing is being sick
@MiaGiovanna happy birthday angel <HEART WITH ARROW>
@ramsesortega_ that's well appreciated, tysm
@ramsesortega_ thanks, i hope so too
@elliexknight you are the cutest
@ramsesortega_ it's fine, i've just been getting it A LOT and it's hella annoyingg and actually makes me feel horrible
i know i'm skinny but don't ever tell me i am "too skinny" only i know my body. so if you have nothing nice to say do not say it at all
skinny shaming is a thing, and i get it way too fucking much. it's really fucking annoying

stop bragging about how many girls are "all over you" it's quite egotistic and obnoxious

Bitch I'm a fucking goddess.
i don't want to go to work tomorrow
and i hope you think of me each time you listen to my favorite songs
if you have nothing nice to say, don't say it at all
hey...hey... stop talking to my secret crush, how rude of u
DO NOT CRITICIZE PEOPLE FOR THE COLOR OF THEIR CLOTHES OR THEIR CLOTHES PERIOD.
maybe no one respects you because you cheat on every one of your 2 week long relationships
for your information, respect is given when you equally give it
i'm so dizzy :(
@ramsesortega_ thank you!
@ramsesortega_ yeah i mean just trying to find a hot girl to have as arm candy and show her off to make guys jealous is horrible!
if you want a girl just to "show her off" then you have no respect
girls are not arm candy
got hella turnt, now i'm hella tired
today i walked in downtown sb and heard a group of dudes singing the front bottoms at the top of their lungs and it made me really happy

have you ever wanted to get to know someone so bad that it frustrates you because you know they'd never ever give you the time of day?
cheers to me for trying to be happy

stop being so dramatic, fucking shit
if you're not ready to be able to put effort into a relationship do not be in one, simple as that.
relationships take a lot of work and effort
do you see couples have and extreme fight and feel relieved that you're single?
i miss being able to call someone babe and give them tons of kisses
depression eats you alive and it fucking sucks
most people are awful and don't deserve to be happy in my opinion
not everyone deserves happiness
i wish everything would get better

if you're in a relationship with someone and have interest in someone else, break up with them immediately, they're not the one you want.

i am attracted to the idea of your lips exploring my body as if it were a map and you kept getting lost on purpose
that wasn't necessary
text someone after 12am and you'll know the real them
bitch
#wcw is @lvurenmvrie  <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

don't pretend like you have anxiety, if you want it fucking take mine away.
i'm beyond pissed
fucking idiot <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
haha wow, how professional of you
makeup and coffee is the key to my heart <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<KEY>
making stupid/deep twitter posts is all i do
@lissettenoelle that's just my opinion, idk
somethings are easy to move on from but i believe if your hurt to the point were you are numb there's no going back nor getting better
i can't sleep for shit anymore
murder all your memory
you're ignorant as fuck, holy shit
i was a fucking idiot last year around this time so i'm going to be majorly upset for a pretty long time
mostly everyone around me have been little shit heads lately
don't fake mental diseases and do the exact opposite of what the actual mental disease does to a person, you look fucking dumb bye
most people say that everyone deserves a second chance. but hell to the fuck no, if you fuck me over once then strike 1, you're out.
some people just can't learn shit <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
if you're going to be a bitch about things then watch, i can play that game too <RELIEVED FACE>
when i want something i'm determined as fuck to fucking get it
i'm a mess, therefore i am
@lissettenoelle i am also aware i spelt dinosaur wrong, lmao. i was taking a lot of pictures and misspelled everything <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@lissettenoelle as a*
i remember for my first halloween my mom dressed me up as an dwarf
i'm feeling like a mess
i'm a lemon

boring night, listening to 2pac and title fight till' i fall asleep

don't take good people for granted
@luciferises one time i stepped in with my socks... oops
if you joke around about killing yourself over small little everyday problems than you're a piece of shit
i understand if your sad on valentines for not having someone but being angry and bitter is not cool man
how could you do that to me?
fuck you, kiss me
and all the sadness inside me melted away like i was free
8 hour shift today <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
i have so many bruises on my butt/ thighs, not even from doing stuff with someone, just by being a clumsy little fuck

@coolplantmom babie <TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS><TWO HEARTS>
jfc
@valeriebunnie ya! i don't really care if people do the same things i do but like everything gets so mainstream so like no one is unique
@lissettenoelle idk if any of you catch my drift but like yea rant over
@lissettenoelle &amp; as soon as something new is in trend it gets so old so easily and quickly because everyone goes and hops on the band wagon
@lissettenoelle and also with guys, all guys act and dress the same too, and idk it upsets me how everyone acts and looks the same ugh
@lissettenoelle nobody is unique anymore, like more girls should get interested in other things rather than hopping on the band wagon <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@lissettenoelle there's nothing wrong with that but like i'm getting bored, everyone looks and acts the same
everything is so mainstream now, like mostly all girls loving makeup is so mainstream, mostly every girl has a nose piercing idk like
the rest of my night consists of me bumpin' this album 
be mine again please
knowing that your not going to get better for a really long time sucks so fucking much
i want to drink away the pain
i loved a boy who didn't appreciate me and it fucked me up
i'm selling my stuff on depop if you want to check it out my username is: sadsouul
@MiaGiovanna i've heard it's super good, and never heard any bad comments about it! i need to make time to watch it <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
most of the time people never change
i know it's bad to blame people for your problems but sometimes it's acceptable because people do cause other peoples problems..
my anxiety is coming back <PENSIVE FACE>
instagram added commas to the likes thing and it bothers me so much idk

learn to love yourself because that's all you have in the end. yourself.
life isn't fair and it fucking hurts
you're gone
i think i've said this before but NOBODY is desperate for wanting love.
you'll be the end of me
if you don't listen to adtr i'm judging you so fucking hard right now
break ups are fucking hard to get over, sad that you're already over it. shows how much you didn't give a shit <RELIEVED FACE>
i don't love you, like i did yesterday
you taught my heart, a sense i never knew i had
if i date you i would spoil you so much, oh my gosh

i was very tired so i went for coffee and now i feel better
cause of death: caffeine overdose
i want to stay in winter <PENSIVE FACE>
it's starting to feel like summer and that makes me hella upset
it's amusing seeing girls get mad at other girls for getting interested in makeup, they're all "i loved makeup first!!" like shut up
they're so many creeps at this coffee shop, holy shit
i'm always going to be unhappy and i've come to accept it
oh
@lissettenoelle *laughs to cover up the disappointment*
please continue reblogging naked girls, it's a huge trigger but you don't seem to give a shit. havahagahah
you didn't give a shit about anything i said and it hurt so much knowing you kept doing what hurts me
2 dogs came into work today and at the same time which made me 10x more happier!!!
i don't want to do anything for a month

i'm having a bad anxiety attack again
do not EVER lash out on someone if they only like you as a friend and nothing more, you just look ignorant as hell
i'm really bad with words and i repeat like and that 100x a day
do you ever just look something up, then something else comes up then you look at that then something pops up then you look at that? idk
what the heck
@lissettenoelle this is a huge thing that upsets me a lot. if you body shame i'm already dumping your lifeless body in a river
@lissettenoelle  and also with calling people fat or over making stupid commentaries, because holy fuck it messes people up real bad
people need to get it in their heads that calling someone too skinny can have a horrible long term effect
everyones been really upset at me lately, and i really don't know why
make art, be art
i'm full of love and nobody wants it
holy fuck it hurts to see you reblog girls that i can never ever look like.

@lissettenoelle i'm not pale, i'm white but i can tan easily. some girls need to fucking stop saying "pale is prettier"
so tired of all these pale girls who shame tan girls, all colors are gorgeous in my opinion.
yellowcard will always be one of my faves
if you drink enough vodka it tastes like love
i always wondered when you stopped loving me
i still listen to your favorite songs, wishing you were in my arms

i'm utterly just tired to take selfies
my hands are freezing and i can't feel them
having the worst stomach pains ever
buy me strawberries, i ran out this afternoon
yum, strawberries are the fkn best
in the mood for some strawberries and water
someone give me motivation to eat healthy and work out
i've gotten so lazy to work on my art lately ):
someone let me borrow their makeup skills...
@animedadirl tru, but at least i'll have an actual living thing to keep me company!! lmao
just want to buy a little kitten to snuggle with and tell my problems to..

i hate crying but when i do i feel really good after for letting it all out
i have nobody to text

i'm not worthy, but i'll try
friendly reminder: crying doesn't make you weak
loving my cartilage piercing <SPARKLING HEART>
i shouldn't, i just need to quit thinking about "possibilities"
should i even have hope in this?
why are you not next to me?
i can't sleep
if you have clear skin, please appreciate it
you're all i want
can i just stay home and drink tea for the rest of my life?
nothing good ever happens to me and i'm not sure why
open up your eyes, love.
can you see me?
time is slowing down, love
it's okay to be sad sometimes
everyone around me is fighting and it is making me very upset
you're obviously blind if you think i still don't love you
just burned some random things i found while cleaning and now it smells gross
people who can't sleep one night and automatically label themselves as an "insomniac" piss me off
there are ghosts in the walls and they crawl in your head through your ears
nothing really feels the same
i want to eat a bunch of cereal and just listen to music to drown out my problems
good morning, i hope you all have a great day
‚Äú@valeriebunnie: I'm doing really good I want someone to be proud of me‚Äù i'm proud of you val!
going to sleep while listening to seahaven
in love with the idea of love
upset

My intention is to fade and I will
have mercy is my fav
retweet if you think there should be a zoo of just all breeds of dogs
yesterday i blew a lot of money on brandy melville, i'm happy
want to go hiking through the forest and not think for a while
if i want a hair cut, i will cut it myself. i rather i mess up on myself then a total stranger fuck it up 100x worse
i do not trust anyone with my hair
feminists do not despise men.
every person who i tell i'm moving to australia, laughs at me. like, i'm serious. what's so fucking funny about that?
i spend so much time on twitter and tumblr, oh my gosh
i only accept apologies in cash
i just want to be happy and at peace and not fight with anyone, i hate fighting <PENSIVE FACE>
i'm done arguing <PENSIVE FACE>
this is bumming me out
if you hook up with someone in a relationship you are a horrible person
love is harsh
someone out there could be dying to talk to you and you wouldn't even know
i look for you in everyone
binge watching youtube videos before i go in for work
yesterday there was this guy that walked into my work and looked exactly like jeremy mckinnon, i seriously was in shock
people that complain about their skin "breaking out horribly" and only having one or two blemishes will go to hell
all i want is flawless skin
can winter last forever? orrrr
sad how some people say they want to make friends yet when someone messages them they don't even appreciate that persons interest in them
don't even want to try at all
i can hear my neighbor snoring
i miss christmas time
the feeling is never mutual
wanting to just spend all my money on clothes
i say like 500 times a day
i hate people who think they're famous and are incredibly stuck up and ignorant
and even if you're not here to stay, i'm happy the universe allowed your soul to stop by
you call the shots babe, i just wanna be yours
and if they want to leave, hold the door open for them
tired of hearing "you should try wearing more colors other than black", i'm going to wear what i god damn please.
seriously just PISS OFF
there's no chance
i'm not easy
just got my cartilage pierced and in pain but ayyy new piercing
i try not to judge cause i'm pretty fucked up myself
i'm exhausted
made a huge mistake by eating a ton of pizza )~:
one day i'll meet you
in the sky we'll hide and seek
seek for me,
love.
drink up one more time and i'll make you mine
you can still have a huge sense of humor, and still be mature
trying to decide wether to move to australia or not
not taking any chances
there's something there
don't go too far, stay who you are
you're so unattainable, and it brings me down
things will get better
things will get better
things will get better
@taylorndean they're obviously blind, lmao. you're gorgeous as heck!
i am surrounded by ignorant people
you are the best thing i never had
@lissettenoelle like literally just shut up, it's pathetic of you to go and tell my ex my business on tumblr like what's wrong with you?
this is to the people who complain about me "complaining on twitter" then go and talk shit about me to my ex about my twitter.. shut up lmao
jesus fucking christ
going to the doctor later today so i can get referred to a dermatologist!
Dine me 
Sixty-nine me
honestly, if i had a nintendo 3ds i wouldn't even use my phone
my hands are freezing i can't type
@kimberlygaunt HAPPY BIRTHDAY <REVOLVING HEARTS>
pet peeve: when people defend celebrities, who are rapists/pedophiles. like get your head out of your ass and look at the facts
"love love love, what is it good for? absolutely nothing"
pet peeve: guys with huge egos
i really don't understand your way of thinking
nothing will ever happen if you don't put yourself out there
why why why why
i am terrified of being rejected in general
@lissettenoelle like i'm terrified of spiders, and the spiders over in australia are horrific
contemplating on moving to la, uk or australia
if your having a bad night like i am i hope everything works out for you
i feel like everyone is having a bad night :(
@lissettenoelle *clap clap*
if you're super emotionally crippled and self conscious clap your hands.
defeater is fucking rad
i want to stay in my bed all day tomorrow
tomorrow i'm going to try to make some calls to some dermatologist offices, because i have had enough with battling such horrible acne.
really wanting to go on accutane, but my doctor is so fucking ignorant and not wanting to recommend me to a dermatologist.
i'm having a mental breakdown
seriously cannot wait to see the unfriended movie!
just because some people get the stuff you want does not give you the right to be a cranky jealous little troll
when i get home i am going to organize everything, i meed to start fresh with everything
i wouldn't give anyone the satisfaction of me killing myself, i'll stay alive just to spite them
someday you will ache like i ache
i'm craving peanut butter for some strange reason
don't you hate it when your trying to focus on something and someone just keeps continuing to talk and talk and talk
someone take me to europe
i always get messages on tumblr saying i complain to much on twitter, but in reality who doesn't complain on twitter? i mean really? <UNAMUSED FACE>
my friend recently convinced me to use spotify and i love it so much. shoutout to him <THUMBS UP SIGN>
i just want perfect eyebrows and a hot bod
some people are just so invested in other peoples lives because they're bored with their own stupid lives.
some people stalk my twitter and assume everything is about certain things, those of you need to get a life.

15 seconds later no reply. 

"Oh God what have I done!"
i cannot handle when people yell at me
