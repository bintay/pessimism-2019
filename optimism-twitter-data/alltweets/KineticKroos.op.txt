Might commit. This is just too much for one to digest.
@realmohamed1 Crucial part of the season, unjustified criticism is normal.
@realmohamed1 Wasn't his fault. Could've done better tho, especially for the first one.
@Mourinholic You seem obsessed with us. That insecure about Hazard joining next season?
@FCBJULIAN3 Benzema lmao, the real best 9 in the world.
@FCBJULIAN3 We have the best striker in the world tho. Got him for half of Suarez' prices.
@HoIyCris Omg...
@NotAManCantona Our best player in the first half. Hit the woodwork twice &amp; created chances.
Imagine believing anything this fat fuck says.
Said that Luka &amp; Benz are OK before the both were sidelined for weeks 
Losing my temper. Better sign out before I say something stupid again.
If this doesn't make you realize that Ancelotti is clueless in football nothing will. 
If Kroos doesn't make it back on time for Juve the CL is officially lost too.
@OsamaRahhal9 Cant you read? "From this league"
@KineticKroos Full focus on CL now. Doubt will go through if Kroos isn't ready for Juve.
League is gone. Only thing we can hope for from this league is for that rentboy Ronaldo to finish Pichichi.
Hope Gaya breaks his leg.
RIP Burnley.
Valencia actually have a bad record away from home this season. Watch them pull off performance of the decade tonight.
@FCBMariam_ Fuck do you want?
Greatest of all time.
I would've given up our front three just to see him take over for one season.  
If Barca drop points today I'll do a full face reveal &amp; buy an iPhone for one of my followers.
State of Bayern...
Why are you nervous for valencia I think it will be e... — Then you clearly haven't watched our last 6 games or ... 
That Ed fucker is starting to piss me off.
Trying so hard to be like Perez lmao.  
@OsamaRahhal9 Ikr unreal times when he made our front 3 look like your average Sunday league player.
@OsamaRahhal9 He's just a shit Jese tho.
The Depay hype is real
People actually think that Isco might leave.
More chances of Messi joining us this summer.
@RashadEra Kroos is 25 and has already achieved more than Lampard. Kroos is the best mediocentro organizador of all time.
@RashadEra Kroos is better than any player who ever represented your shit club tho
@FCBJULIAN3 You maybe won't win, but you'll obviously qualify.
@IlIarramendi @SocialRMadrid Deffo, best Uruguayan striker
@realmohamed1 It must be Vecchi the lad then, our keepers have been underperforming ever since he joined anyway.
@realmohamed1 I'm *
@realmohamed1 Whatever the drill was in pretty sure it wasn't meant to be with that pace. Even Osama can do what Iker is doing.
@realmohamed1 Lmao looks similar to me
AHAHAHAHAHHAA GOOD TIMES 
@ahmedgazarin Manager too
@Merengue_TK8 Doubt Pogba will happen. Was just talks, don't think there's strong interest.
@realmohamed1 He better be. Will throw him off the top of his penthouse if he doesn't get Verratti and the other lads signed.
Other clubs have already approached their targets and Perez is still chillin like a villain.  
@SkySportsNewsHQ RIP gone but never forgotten
@realmohamed1 Must've been because of Spartans pep talk during warmups.
@VamosJese Agreed. We're stuck with players like Illara &amp; Arbeloa now.
@realmohamed1 I'd agree except that I don't know what the Fuk is going on.

@realmohamed1 True, Sundeep Rajesh.
@realmohamed1 First letter of my real name lol
@realmohamed1 I'm a cunt
Benzema, Aguero, Suarez, Sanchez, Costa. 
@KineticKroos Vidal you bald cunt &lt;3
Sevilla!
@Pinkslayer07 @BayernHome You can die with him too
AHAHAHAHAHA JUST DIE @BayernHome
@IlIarramendi @YouTube Wasn't trying to get involved in the first place to keep the tie alive and entertaining for the return leg what a lad
@IlIarramendi @YouTube FU
@ahmedgazarin Ye, made Kroos his bitch. Only time I saw Kroos struggle.
@ahmedgazarin 
AHAHAHHAHAHAHAH 
If Cancer was a picture. 
@realmohamed1 @VamosJese Mate, Arbeloa would've been chillin at their corner flag when Tevez broke thro.
@atamaster123 But Carlo is thick. He used to play Kroos deeper than Illara &amp; Silva when they played alongside each other.
@atamaster123 Thats what I wanted since Luka's injury. Ramos covering for Kroos so that the latter can have more freedom going upfront.
@atamaster123 We have available since Modric is injured &amp; Kroos having to worry about his defensive responsibilities.
@atamaster123 I'd start him. Isco will run his lungs out, no doubt, but we need him upfront to create. One of the few creative players
@atamaster123 Tevez' pace is frightening &amp; Morata is a good holder of the ball. If Ramos can replicate his performance vs Atleti
@atamaster123 Its alright mate. Pogba's physicality could be worrying tho, we will be under constant threat to concede from counter
@realmohamed1 I honestly won't mind that. Never delivered a bad performance when played there.
@realmohamed1 Bale is our best crosser tho.
@atamaster123 Should be asking you. We're screwed aren't we?
@realmohamed1 Bale as LB &amp; agreed.
@SerdarRexhepos Watch some @Brazzers 
You'll get some tips on how to screw teachers during detention.
@SerdarRexhepos Tell her that I need some help with Biology and shit.
@SerdarRexhepos It says Mr wtf.
She fit?
@SerdarRexhepos 'Fatbardha'
would test his chin.
What kind of Hookah has Benatia been smoking lately? 
@AlcantaraFlair Yes of course. Although if they sign all their targets I see them being a threat to the top teams in the CL next season.
United will actually have the best squad in Europe next season. Can't wait to floor them in next year Semis.
@KineticKroos RvN**
Nadal sex me pal
@Mourinholic Hazard can forget about that PFA award next season.
Depay officially to United.
We should go all out for Reus now.
@DezilDez James &gt;
@WhoScored Suarez...
@FCBJULIAN3 @RahatRMadrid How exactly did he own him there lol?
@FCBJULIAN3 @RahatRMadrid Varane? Never.
@FCBJULIAN3 Agreed, Boateng closed him down in the World Cup final tho.
@FCBJULIAN3 Stop obsessing over her you depressed cunt.
@kriskisso Said that we were playing with 10 men.
@realmohamed1 Alright then, another season without silverware. Won't be long before a civil war breaks in this fanbase because of him.
@realmohamed1 You obviously do. You just don't want to be proven wrong after you backed him &amp; said he's the man for the job. Crystal-clear.
@realmohamed1 You want him gone just as much as I do, stop trolling.
@realmohamed1 You rate Ancelotti tho...
@Merengue_TK8 @ahmedgazarin Hire some guy from the street for all I care. Just want him to leave.
Dead to me. 
@ahmedgazarin Unreal stuff
@ahmedgazarin Sue me
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ His luck in life &gt; actually. Was lucky not to get sacked after 4-0 Atleti.
@realmohamed1 You seem hurt.
@TheNewBlackGuy Few days before the final.
@KineticKroos Provided Modric is match-fit for the final of course.
@KineticKroos With the history of luck Carlo has in this competition I genuinely see us winning the champions league this season.
CL final against Barca should be one of our easiest matches this season. Expect a thrashing, Modric bossing their midfield as per.
@realmohamed1 Won't waste my time trying to argue with someone who has some kind of agenda against Bale. Rest my case.
@realmohamed1 Khedira is more of a fighter than Bale is, so what's your point? Bale ran his lungs out against Bayern last year.
@RahatRMadrid It started with Ancelotti lmao
@Rikabi3li Bit fat but agreed. Most loyal fan I know after me.
@realmohamed1 Scoring in a CL final &gt; all the silverware that thug won.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 @UltraSuristic Spurs fans are the best in the world.
@Rikabi3li Roncero communicating with the dead again to pull off a comeback?
@IlIarramendi Like really fat
@realmohamed1 Irish, Welsh, Scottish, what difference does it make?
Bale accomplished more in his 7 year career than that cunt.
@IlIarramendi Ancelotti is ridiculously fat
@IlIarramendi hi
@realmohamed1 He's obviously jealous of his fellow British lad. Doesn't take two to figure it out.
@KineticKroos On a baller like Bale, who at 25 has already accomplished more than that mug managed in his lifetime.
Roy Keane confirmed nonce after his comments about Bale yesterday. Even if it's true, he shouldn't make comments like that...
@RahatRMadrid Thanks for having me imagine that dude.
@Iscoeh FFS. Was about to sleep.
@realmohamed1 Only good thing about Barca winning the treble is Florentino's rage. Lad will assemble together the greatest squad of all time
@Jese20licious @Rikabi3li Of course they were the better side, best team ever. If Perez signs the right ballers in summer we will do great.
@Jese20licious @Rikabi3li Dunno if you've noticed but for the past three years we've  been more successful than Barca.
@Rikabi3li I lost the plot with Ramos &amp; Bale. One looks like he's playing in a training session &amp; the other thinks he's peak Beckenbauer.
@Rikabi3li @Jese20licious Of course we can. Best club in the world.
@realmohamed1 
@Rikabi3li @Jese20licious Of course. He's dead to me if he looks disinterested again like yesterday.
@Rikabi3li @Jese20licious Ramos has a big mouth. Unless he does something to turn it around in the 2nd leg his promises mean nothing.
@realmohamed1 AHAHAHAHAHAHA COMING FROM YOU
@Rikabi3li @Jese20licious I'm tired 3
My romantic skills are criminally underrated.
Any girl (or guy) on here would be more than lucky to have me.
@EatenApplee Lmao, it's true tho.
@TouchOfKroos Only person I'm in love with is Kroos.
How do you know that you're in love? — It's when you can't stop thinking about that person no matter how hard yo... 
Remember when everyone mocked me for calling Pep a fraud?
Good times.
@realmohamed1 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ I'm not. I always told you how I feel about Khedira &amp; a little motivation could bring the best out of him.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ @realmohamed1 Yes, the best German in our team.
@realmohamed1 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Maybe true, but he's our key to achieving something this season.
@realmohamed1 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Don't hate on the tank. He might be the reason we make it to Berlin.
@FCBarcelona Midget.
@LFCHadouken Di Marzio the bellend says that we're after Pogba, Ancelotti wants Verratti tho. Casemiro is an alternative option.
@LFCHadouken Seems like the most likely destination but Di Marzio says PSG are also interested.
PSG are after Khedira. 
Napoli want Illara &amp; Silva.
Big fan of Ancelotti using Pepe, Varane &amp; Ramos as our CM's next season.
.@IsmailPatel_ Your mum.
The next two matches will define our season. I hope two certain mugs step it up in the coming days.
@OsamaRahhal9 @IlIarramendi In terms of performance? Almost every game.
@IlIarramendi Had an average game....
@realmohamed1 Will.
Clasico final it is then.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ If Bale was playing...
That shocking pace of Muller &amp; Lewa tho...
0-3 if Robben &amp; Ribery were fit.
@IlIarramendi @Mubaaaarak Oh, if that's the case they would've handed us the D.
Ramos CM against them would be biblical.
@realmohamed1 At least it works.
@IlIarramendi @Mubaaaarak Modric &amp; Benzema injured, Bale just back from his injury.
@IlIarramendi @Mubaaaarak We have a proper attack &amp; midfield.
Lewandowski &amp; Suarez bottled two clear cut chances. Benzema best striker in the world confirmed.
This will end 4-1
Look at this beg... 
Pretty sure football is Kroos' 3rd favorite sport.
@EatenApplee Banter
BayernBarca combined XI.
Neuer
Lahm
Boateng
Pique
Alaba
Busquets
Alonso
Thiago
Robben
Messi
Suarez
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Why would he?
This new Twitter update...
@MadridVoice Fair enough.
@MadridVoice He wasn't even our worst player lmao. Ramos &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
@MadridVoice Grow up.
@IlIarramendi Deffo not me, that hair is aids af
@IlIarramendi Always knew you were good looking, no homo.
@realmohamed1 Actually, yes it is. Imagine not losing your brain when you see that fat Italian's face everyday.
@realmohamed1 Was it Mourinho's fault that mugs like Cahill &amp; Terry man mark each other in a corner? Funny how you dodged the Istanbul final
@realmohamed1 Stop bringing that match up. Was similar to Pep's bottle job against Chelsea in 2012. Need i remind you of the Istanbul final?
@Madridate SMH, seems like no one can handle my hard hitting truth.
@realmohamed1 He made them look good. Just like he's making Matic, Fabregas &amp; the other frauds at Chelsea look good.
@realmohamed1 That's beside the point. Give him this squad and he'll do wonders.
@realmohamed1 Alright, now close your eyes &amp; compare that squad to the current one. You'd know why Mou 'failed' in his time at Madrid.
When Osama's uses his incredible punditry skills &gt;&gt;&gt; 
@realmohamed1 We were better as a unit. Compare this season to 2011/2012 before you mention me again.
@OsamaRahhal9 Might take a while. I'll stop when Ancelotti leaves.
@realmohamed1 LMAO, the rage is real. 
Like it or not we're irrelevant as a team now. Relying on individual brilliance is all we do nowadays
@realmohamed1 No, but for bringing back legitimacy to this team.
@realmohamed1 Instead of hating on me, join the 'Bring Back Mou' movement.
Need you to send Perez my message love. 
DM for details. @Jeinnylizarazo
@SemperIiber Our best player tonight but that was shocking.
@realmohamed1 Ready to forgive him if he comes back. I was bantering all along with the Carlo hate but after tonight genuinely want him gone
And don't you dare tell me that Carlo accomplished what Mou couldn't. You expect Mou to reach a CL final with Álvaro &amp; Sami as starters?
@realmohamed1 All I said is that I'd test his chin.
@SemperIiber Mou IS the best in the world. All he needs is a good squad under his disposal to win the sextuple.
Comeback home BAE 
@iStanForDamon Might forgive later.
.@OhDernSure @RM_Insider Yes, because that's exactly how it works.
@kriskisso He'll do a better job than Ramos &amp; Illaramendi.
Muted 26 of the 83 that I follow.
Unreal how cringe this place gets after we suffer a loss.
Our only hope in the second leg. 
.@klauserlfc He has a buy-back option which is similar to a loan you fucking inbred SOB.
@mediocentroEN Yes.
Hope we bring Morata back from his loan, give him a lifetime contract &amp; throw him with the reserves for the rest of his career.
@realmohamed1 Don't be optimistic, be happy. This could've been a lot worse.
Carvajal, Varane &amp; James &gt;
@GuillemBalague Fucking your mum
Whatever happens, #HalaMadrid.
@OsamaRahhal9 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Truly shocking.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Your analysis is worse than Julian's.
@PossessionStats Ye, probably. Bale gives me hope tho.
@BlueTweets10 He wouldn't even make your starting 11
Juve's bench is actually worse than ours.
Will be disappointed if we don't end the tie tonight.
Need you to break Morata's leg pal. 
@officialpepe
@Chase_Ryan He actually found nothing mate. If you look at the bench you'd see that there are no other options.
@realmohamed1 Agreed, you two are about the same age so you shouldn't have a problem getting along.
@TheRamosHeader @BlueTweets10 Didn't even see it you moron.
Fuck is a Sturaro? 
@BlueTweets10 Poor mans Bale.
@realmohamed1 Had me in tears, shame that he's fat tho. 
@Pherson24 History has nothing to do with this, form does.
Roncero what a guy.
It's like his life is on the line. 
@LFCHadouken @realmohamed1 It would've been him or Isco &amp; everyone knows who's the better option.
Hate being the favorites in a big game. Being the underdogs is unreal lmao no pressure
@Illarra24 @ChampionsLeague You make Arbeloa look good.
What a retarded question. 
@LFCHadouken So did Sevilla against us. We may lose the midfield battle but without Benzema we are more direct &amp; dynamic.
@LFCHadouken Then you clearly haven't seen our match against Atleti.
@IlIarramendi Gotze &gt; James?
Lmao.
@RM_Insider Little pessimism doesn't make me sad lmao
@RM_Insider The only Italian ass getting kicked tonight is Ancelotti's.
Ibra needs 5 more goals to become PSG's all time top scorer. Lmao tinpot club indeed.
@FCBJULIAN3 @SerdarRexhepos Bale is better looking than you &amp; your entire family you frog.
@IlIarramendi @ElMadridismo93 That's bad news. He would've flopped if he started.
@ahmedgazarin @realmohamed1 @Rikabi3li True, but he didn't. BBC's worst performance of all time.
@realmohamed1 @Rikabi3li Think that was one of the first matches he played after injury. 6 months later he'd win us the 10th. Unreal.
@realmohamed1 @Rikabi3li But didn't. Remember the shot being 100+ KM/HR
@Rikabi3li Very likely tbh. Almost ended Buffon's career with that strike the last time they met.
@Rikabi3li Get run over by a bulldozer.
@Rikabi3li Optimistic?
.@Rasad316 Yeah, he's most probably scoring a header tomorrow.
Impressive. If he win the FA cup he'll prove what I said about him earlier this season, one of the top 3 signings. 
@realmohamed1 LMAO, look at him in 0:50
Tank, Spartan &amp; Batman all started that game, no wonder they bossed us lmao.
@KineticKroos Shocking pace tho. Therefore he's irrelevant.
Huge miss tomorrow. 
@realmohamed1 @MadridVoice Harsh lmao
@MadridVoice Why do you keep on dying?
Arsenal wankfest on my timeline...
.@Mourinholic Try Bale you cunt. Yeah that's what I thought.
@realmohamed1 That was before he bottled 2 leagues &amp; made us look like the second best team in Madrid.
My boy Ramsey 2-0
@realmohamed1 Just look at that face &amp; tell me how is it possible not to commit knowing that this mug is in charge. 
@realmohamed1 @MrAncelotti Because it takes a genius to get it done...
@SemperIiber Shit duo
@realmohamed1 @SerdarRexhepos Tank of course. He at least plays soccer.
@realmohamed1 @SerdarRexhepos I actually don't mind him being useless anymore, just don't want the bloke to cost us titles.
@SerdarRexhepos @RMadridHome Already got it when I saw Illara subbed on against Sevilla.
@IlIarramendi @Arsenal Ozil &amp; Ramsey &gt;
Don't bottle it. @Arsenal
@RMadridHome Hi, this is a new Kroos stats account. Can I have a shoutout?
@RM_Insider &amp; how exactly I'm i disrespecting him? I'd give up my left kidney to see him return to his best. Take off your fanboy glasses.
@RM_Insider Imagine thinking that I was serious, SMH. You make it sound like Iker is related to you tho.
@RM_Insider Hope Iker concedes tomorrow.
@RM_Insider That's legt the only good tweet I've seen from you.
@UltraSuristic Delete mate.
The last time Carlo faced Allegri I was at the game. It ended with Fat fuck losing as per, see it happening again tomorrow.
@IlIarramendi @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Definitely. Isco &gt;
@realmohamed1 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Their best player is Tevez lmao imagine that life. He wouldn't even make Castilla's bench. Easy win.
@haagenhaanz Yes, Carlo wanted Di Maria &amp; Xabi to stay tho. Doesn't have complete freedom.
@DareToJese By everyone you mean the blind 'football' fans who know nothing about the game. Dortmund &amp; Bayern played spectacular football.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ We won't tho. Juve are a nothing club I see us winning with a 4+ goal difference.
@DareToJese Dortmund &amp; Bayern? We weren't the favorites mate.
@IlIarramendi Fat fuck Deffo will
@haagenhaanz He definitely can if Perez gives him the freedom to sign the players he wants.
@realmohamed1 Alright. Still winning all 6 titles next season tho.
.@haagenhaanz Sextuple
@RMadridEmilio Want him.
@haagenhaanz We won't need a CB if Pepe stays. Verratti + our current midfield would e prefect.
Arbeloa, Iker &amp; Illaramendi.
Danilo, De Gea &amp; Verratti.  
Ancelotti: "Balance is important IMHO"
@kupid91 Worth a try.
@PossessionStats @BarcaChief Lmao I was trying to get Chief to rage &amp; you bring my master into this, not cool.
@RM_Insider Our 3rd best CB &amp; 2nd best goalkeeper.
@PossessionStats @BarcaChief More like, he shat his pants imo.
@BarcaChief 'Injured'

@SerdarRexhepos Why is Perez giving you a lecture?
@realmohamed1 RIP road to Berlin.
Your pundits &lt;
@beINSPORTS
@realmohamed1 @realmadriden Thought you worshiped Raul? I'd be mad if someone broke Bale's record of most goals for a certain club.
@realmohamed1 @realmadriden Next season is probably his last anyway. Committing when he breaks Raul's record?
@Rikabi3li New owner new start, hopefully.
Lopez athleticism &gt;
@NotAManCantona Would you swap him for Reus?
Milan are depressing.
@realmohamed1 @realmadriden Ikr that would be unreal, Bale Benz Reus.
@realmadriden Reus needed lads
3-0
Hamsik &gt;

I understand if you can't comprehend. 
@SocialRMadrid 1-2
@realmohamed1 Agree, AIDS ridden season. But this is one of many were he acted as a cone in goal. 
@realmohamed1 Even with us he had his moments, but inconsistent af. Lost count of how many times he was beaten at his near post.
@realmohamed1 Lopez &lt;
LOPEZ!
Red card!
@realmohamed1 That match will cost us the league. Thanks to your boy, the fat cunt.
@Rikabi3li Just kidding, I see us winning the game anyway.
No Gaya next week. Imagine thinking that's relevant tho after we've dropped points at home against Villarreal's B team.
@mediocentroEN Alonso has been bang average.
@realmohamed1 Because all that hate was unjustified &amp; you were the first Madridista that I met on here who wanted him dead.
@Alikhair7 
@realmohamed1 I actually bullied you because I thought you were a cule in disguise. Had like 50 followers &amp; said shit like Iniesta &gt; Zizou.
That GCSE exam hall selfie was legendary.
@realmohamed1 Lmao wasn't about Ronaldo but K.
@realmohamed1 Mou? He has been dead to me ever since he fired shots at our players just a few months after he left, the cunt.
@realmohamed1 Dunno if this is a joke or a fact but I'd do it regardless of his age.
@Pherson24 They'll struggle against a team like Juve without Benz.
Would love to test Mourinho's son chin.
Bale &amp; Ronaldo upfront vs Juve.
Don't like the look of this but Benzema doesn't seem to be 100% fit. I'd start Chicha.
I'd congratulate Chelsea but they're all fucking rentboys mate, everyone of them Chelsea bastards are fucking rentboys.
Hazard lmao terrible penalty
Hazard you beast.
Penalty!
@VamosJese He'd prefer a slice of Pizza but k.
@VamosJese Scenes if we manage to win all.
@Rikabi3li Arbeloa would deffo beat him in a race.
@SemperIiber Terrible finish.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 @iMiaSanMia Lmao.
@realmohamed1 Need you to keep bullying Chief.
@realmohamed1 Need Osama to do the Stinger Splash on that cunt.
@realmohamed1 @GarethBale11 Nah, Isco is my master &gt;
@GarethBale11 Keep up the good work lad. Score against Juve &amp; I'll forever be your slave.
@ahmedgazarin Yeah that was terrible. His assist today tho COULD be huge if the Atleti thugs do something against Barca.
Bale might win us the league after having an average season. Unreal.
Hala Madrid!
@ahmedgazarin Sex me
Bale assists from his first touch of the game.
BALE IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THIS TEAM.
BAAAAAAAALEEER
Carvajal is terrible.
@Pherson24 He's a retard, that's why.
@TheAncelottiWay @CasillasWorld Yes, get mad.
You too, @CasillasWorld 
Learn how to fucking dive.
I HOPE U FUCKING DIE YOU BASTARD.
LEAVE MY CLUB NOW.
@SergioRamos
AGAAAAAAIIIIN
Isco unreal assist!
Ronaldo. Goat.
@RM_Insider You know that we have to defeat their 2 direct rivals for that spot, right?
Unreal deflection
@EatenApplee Just the truth lol.
@OsamaRahhal9 You didn't have to smile tho. You were definitely happy.
@OsamaRahhal9 Ignoring whatever you say after this 
@OsamaRahhal9 Lmao but make no mistake, Bale is still our best player.
@IlIarramendi He isn't even 100% fit ffs, Chicharito beg af but needed.
@IlIarramendi Need to see the bigger picture lad, can't drop points. Bale still GOAT tho.
Bale benched, great. Chicha is in great form &amp; I wouldn't start Bale instead of him.
Looks like Llorente will start instead of Morata this Tuesday. Pirlo crossing to Llorente, RIP us.
If Lahm gets injured tonight I'll hunt down that fraud Pep.
RIO!
@iMiaSanMia Trust me, with or without Robben you're not the underdogs in this tie.
@ElMadridismo93 You have the nerve to watch some shit called 'Castilla' when we could lose the league tonight?
@Mourinholic No it wasn't you cunt lmao. Mou unreal bottler.
@RMadridEmilio Me
@IlIarramendi @ahmedgazarin @SemperIiber @IRaheemGo @EIPistoIero Deactivate bae
@IlIarramendi @OsamaRahhal9 @H41DER_H_ Lmao, look at how happy he looks. Exposed.
@IlIarramendi :')
@OsamaRahhal9 With Heda?
@OsamaRahhal9 FFS, what uni do you go to?
AHAHAHAHHAAHAH. Even when Ramos is played in midfield, Kroos is the deepest man.  
@OsamaRahhal9 @PossessionStats No you cunt.
@realmohamed1 Lmao probably not, need to give it a try tho.
@realmohamed1 Yes, they see him as a father for some reason. Jokes aside, would sex Carlo.
@gjcxafc @SemperIiber Well, it used to be his best attribute. It's either your players can finish or he just lost his magic.
@realmohamed1 Poor lad lmao no one likes/rates him. Starting to feel sorry for the fat fuck, he's the Illaramendi of managers.
Lmao, RIP Ancelotti.  
@IlIarramendi 
@SemperIiber Hames IS the best 10 in the world.
@IlIarramendi Lmao do me a favor &amp; don't put Ozil &amp; Bale in the same sentence.
@SemperIiber That's still a sad stat. James the lad was out for 2 months &amp; has 11 league assists.
Ozil has 5 assists only in the PL this season?!
Frög is supposed to be the best playmaker in Europe FFS.
@OsamaRahhal9 @realmohamed1 Can I come too?
Moyes fucking shit up atm.
@realmohamed1 Unreal, one Italian beg is already too much for us to handle tho.
@ElMadridismo93 My reaction is a bit different TBH.
@realmohamed1 Yeah, always flirting with our club. Deffo dying to join back.
So obvious that Capello is trying to jinx our team. Would love to test his chin, just like his fellow fat Italian manager.
@realmohamed1 Of course, preparing the younger generation to develop the slum mentality.
If I ever become a manager... 
Can't believe we're losing the league tomorrow. Carlo &amp; the players must be ashamed of themselves for letting this slip.
@realmohamed1 Doubt useless mugs like him get free transport to games. Lad probably takes a cab.
@TouchOfKroos Kroos &gt;
@KineticKroos Kroos chillin like a villain in the back, GOAT. 
Spot the GOAT 
@PossessionStats Biggest cunt on here.
@realmohamed1 @SemperIiber @PossessionStats You never said it but you're deffo a fanboy. You think that Messi is better than Bale, in tears.
@realmohamed1 @SemperIiber @PossessionStats Lmao, you wanted him to win it.
Oliver has become a certified badass. 
Great work lads @CW_Arrow
@RahatRMadrid @OsamaRahhal9 See it happening tbh. Ronaldo &amp; Benzema will flop against a decent defensive side as per &amp; Bale will save us.
@realmohamed1 Fucksake.
@KineticKroos Signing*
@OsamaRahhal9 Just do me a favor &amp; don't celebrate his hattrick vs Juventus.
United just won't give up their pursuit of Bale. LvG needs to realize that the chances of him singing Bale are next to impossible.
@Mourinholic Translator.
@realmohamed1 Kinda, it's all good tho. He'll be proving doubters wrong soon, storm is coming<HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN>️
@realmohamed1 Scenes when he scores in each of the four next games.
@Rikabi3li Fuk
@Rikabi3li Gaya changing his mind about renewing if they don't get the CL spot &gt;
@Mourinholic Lmao, Bale &gt;&gt;
@realmohamed1 Watch them pull off performance of the century against us.
@OsamaRahhal9 I know, wanted to change the carrier tho.
@OsamaRahhal9 Changed it once actually. Phone got stolen by some wench.
@OsamaRahhal9 @Rikabi3li Lmao how can you call me if you don't have my number?
@OsamaRahhal9 @Rikabi3li Lmao fuck off, I'm not going to argue with you in this anymore. I proved you wrong.
@Rikabi3li @OsamaRahhal9 He didn't expose shit this cunt.
@Rikabi3li He's the only person who I hate more than Parejo &amp; Osama.
@Rikabi3li Hope Parejo does his ACL, the cunt.
@mediocentroEN Isco needs to battle James for that starting spot. We've seen him play alongside Kroos this season because of Luka's injury.
The awkward moment when we sign the wrong mediocentro from PSG.  
@mediocentroEN Lack of rotation might be the reason we finish trophyless this season. Verratti will rotate with Modric/Kroos.
@mediocentroEN Where would you play him if he joins us?
@SerdarRexhepos Gained respect.
@realmohamed1 Thank, need him to commit now.
Bale back in training<SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>
WTF 
@DezilDez Benzema &gt;
@leylahamed Holy...
@realmohamed1 Yup, never heard his name before in my life.
@realmohamed1 Same
@Jese20licious LOL, the rage is definitely real.
@YourMomBot Blocked.
Looks like Lewa will be ready for Barca. Ribery rumoured to be available for the first leg too.
@SemperIiber LMAO, what a sad virgin. Need some big account to retweet this &amp; expose him.
Looks bad for Asenjo. 
Need someone to do a simple photo edit. Please DM.
@SemperIiber You can tell that he gets bullied IRL. 
@SemperIiber Big headed white cunt.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ @realmohamed1 2015 has been tough on you tho. First you get your CL final ticket application rejected &amp; know this. Animo.
@SemperIiber That'll be biblical. Bloke says he has been watching football for 20+ years. TV's didn't even exist in Brazil until the 2000's.
@EatenApplee @Rikabi3li Ahahahaahahah.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Gws bae, we're all with you.
@Rikabi3li I'd create more accounts to make his life miserable but I ran out of E-mail accounts.
@Jese20licious He has 100+k tweets &amp; has literally blocked every Madridista on here. Would love to dropkick his nan.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ Remember you reaching a thousand not so long ago. Is there something that you know &amp; we don't?
I actually made 3 new accounts just to tell @lucasammr that he's one fat SOB, got blocked on all three. Starting to think I'm obsessed.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ Hmmmm, you DID gain a thousand followers in a month or so. Something is fishy.
@leylahamed @sehmanzer1 You must feel lucky.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ HAAHAHHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH.
It's funny because he actually deserved it.  
I hope you die in front of your parents &amp; family. @Illarra24
Would let Kroos rape me.
KROOOOOOS GOAT
@BarcaChief James &gt; Suarez
@EvokedUnited 2nd best midfielder in the world.
@EvokedUnited Funny coming from a Di Maria fan lmao
@KineticKroos Best signing after Kroos of course.
Signing of the summer scores our 100th league goal of the season.
HAMESSSSSSSSS
@CR7KlNG And never will, unfortunately.
@VamosJese Slight exaggeration from me but he seriously needs to leave the club. Players like him &amp; the cunt Arbeloa don't belong here.
The amount of hate Illara gets is unreal. I'd feel bad for the lad but he's useless &amp; needs to retire ASAP.
@Rikabi3li I'd park the bus against Sevilla &amp; hope for the best if I was Ancelotti. No need to risk our CL chances with injuries &amp; fatigue.
@Rikabi3li Isco resting tonight means that Fat fuck is expecting him to run his socks off vs Juve. Looks like he'll play Luka's role.
@SocialRMadrid Do you think Chris Benoit was framed?
If Odegaard scores in his 10 minute debut tonight I swear I'll deactivate forever.
@realmohamed1 Yup, does what is required &amp; expected from a player like him. The fat fuck tho...
@realmohamed1 He's being rested for Pre-season.
@FCBJULIAN3 Pussy.
@AtharvaGautam Schweinsteiger...
@KineticKroos Pizarro is a nothing player tho. No way a donkey like him is capable of scoring in the Camp Nou.
@Rikabi3li @mohilparekh That's the spirit.
@rmArdit I'm not.
@SemperIiber @Rikabi3li There is no coming back from that. Let's just hope we avoid them in the final.
@Rikabi3li Anyway, by the looks of it Barca have one leg in the final if Lewa doesn't play the first leg IMO. Bold statement, I know.
@Rikabi3li Confirmed?
@DopeSmolder "IF" Bayern reach the final.
@kriskisso FCB are not definitely in the final, it's still 50/50. I'd rather face FCB but Bayern's recent injuries make them the weaker side
@modricfan7 Bayern are a bigger threat to us than Barca, so yes.
We're actually winning the UCL lads. If Bayern reach the final they'll have to face us without Robben &amp; Alaba.
@realmadriden Reus
@PossessionStats The club is denying a crime which we might or might not be punished for. They're confident that there's nothing to it.
@PossessionStats @TheAncelottiWay He meant that we wouldn't have even published a statement in the first place.
@SemperIiber Killer.
Lewa missing the first leg too?
AHAHAHAHAHH 
@realmohamed1 Rather have problems on the pitch than in the locker room, cba with another 12-13-esque season.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ He's shit. Actually, Shit &gt; him.
@realmohamed1 
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Morata was actually worse than Illara last season. So there's hope for Illaramendi if he leaves after all.
@SemperIiber Its actually a stat, Bale 3rd most dribbles in league after Messi &amp; Neymar. Alexis is poverty btw, terrible decision making.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Typical, Perez had an orgy after seeing a Spaniard perform against some u-21 side.
@SemperIiber Lmao the irony is real. Bale has completed more dribbles than any other player from our squad.
@Jese20licious Of course he'll be back to his best. Needs to work hard in summer &amp; recover mentally.
When your mum comes back from shopping groceries 
@realmohamed1 You thought he'd be  Ronaldo's replacement lmao.
@Jese20licious Steroids abuse.
@Jese20licious Yes, of course. Disappointing season.
@realmohamed1 Who are you trying to fool? You were probably the 2nd happiest person on earth at that moment.
@Jese20licious 3rd best player in the world after Messi &amp; Modric.
Best day of my life. Not even kidding.  
@SemperIiber @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Just a shit Reus but agree.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Had to be done. Arbeloa has been unreal in 2015, deffo up there with Lahm &amp; Cafu.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Spartan &amp; Pirate in one team &gt; MSN
@realmohamed1 I'd feel guilty but I doubt he understands English, or anything for that matter. The bloke is brainless
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ cute 
@realmohamed1 Anyone but that fraud Illara. I actually feel bad for him, lad thinks he's a footballer LMAO.
@leylahamed Same, Pirata's spirit needed.
@KineticKroos Moyes is apparently open to the idea of Illara returning. This deal would benefit all 3 parties.
We need to sign back Granero. I swear he'd do a better job than Illaramendi.
Better Call Saul LAD @Perez
@realmohamed1 @OsamaRahhal9 Committing soon anyway. Thanks to your boy, the bald headed fucktard.
@OsamaRahhal9 @realmohamed1 Yes, that's what I meant. If they reject our appeal then there is a clear conspiracy.
@realmohamed1 If they postponed Barca's they should definitely postpone ours too?
Hope we get the ban. Will force Flo to move his fatass &amp; sign Reus, De Gea &amp; Messi.
@RahatRMadrid Bayern's defense is not bad at all wtf? It's always the individual mistakes that lead to them conceding.
@RahatRMadrid SMH. Barca's defense isn't great btw.
@RahatRMadrid You serious? Bayern still favorites believe it or not.
@IsmailPatel_ @samuelJayC Thanks!
@PossessionStats Pep is a fraud. Tata &gt;
Ahahahhahaa need the vine of Klopp's reaction after Neuer's miss.
If Pep fails against Barca he's deffo getting the sack.
Neuer HAHAHAHAHAH wtf
Neuer!
Gotze you fraud
AHAHHAHAHA ALONSO YOU THUG
Fat Serdar scores!
LAHM! FFS
Mia San Mia IMO
@realmohamed1 Dortmund will literally be kicking at a wall. Neuer &gt;
@NeuerFC stfu you catfish
Penalties, Neuer has got this.
AHAHAHAH Pep has gone full retard.
@BarcaChief Not every CB is Luiz lmao.
@EvokedUnited idk
Need Dortmund to lose this &amp; for Reus to go through a deep depression that'll cause him to leave.
Fuck this shit. Barca have been injury free all season &amp; their direct rivals have the best players injured.
Robben injured?!
@realmohamed1 That's good IMO. Even tho he destroyed Barca in 2013, he's not the player he used to be.
Messi hasn't rested since the defeat to Moyes in Jan. RIP Barca.
@IlIarramendi Ye, need replacement for Coentrao tho. Alaba in a few.
@MesmerISCO @IlIarramendi If he renews? Next to impossible.
@IlIarramendi Unreal but Gaya won't be joining.
@OsamaRahhal9 Shocking, wishing injury on your own player.
@OsamaRahhal9 Just commit.
@IlIarramendi /:
Seen his Isco tweet?
@realmohamed1 Lmao, harsh. Could regain some of his confidence if Wenger gives him this opportunity.
@realmohamed1 True, but it'll logical if they go for him.
@IlIarramendi Will miss the goat, Dave tho &gt;
@SemperIiber Imaging deciding to chip 'Peak Buffon' in a World Cup final.
️Casillas to Arsenal apparently.
Would be weird seeing us knock him out of the champions league, should we draw them.
@GetFootballNews Bale
@Rikabi3li Same. You might wanna change yours tho, we missed out on him.
@Rikabi3li Nuevo Bernabeu &amp; logic.
@FutBale47 Could be.
Odegaard first team debut in a few lads.
@SemperIiber @IlIarramendi Won't mind that happening. He'll be Modric' replacement anyway because why not.
@SemperIiber @IlIarramendi Lmao I don't watch Arsenal week in week out. Whenever I do watch, Ramsey impresses me more.
@SemperIiber @IlIarramendi Isco &gt; Ramsey &gt; Wilshere.
@IlIarramendi Agreed, Isco might reach Zidane's level next year at the age of just 24. Unreal stuff.
@IlIarramendi Isco best u-25 player in the world?
@realmohamed1 Proving a point &gt; winning the competition which we pretty much own.
@IlIarramendi One of his worst performances of the season &amp; still manages to pull three unreal skill moves. Definition of goat.
@realmohamed1 Can't wait too. Need him to knock us out of the CL next season.
@realmohamed1 Anyway, it's a matter of time until you open Twitter to find the 'COMUNICADO OFICIAL' tweet chillin in your timeline.
@NotAManCantona Yup, I see you dominating domestically if you sign the right ballers.
@NotAManCantona Agreed. Bale will take your team to another level under LVG, provided you fix the mess in the back of course.
@IlIarramendi MOTM performance in the final. Proved his worth in the grandest stage.
@NotAManCantona Would you rather have him back or sign Bale?
We're almost in May....like I swear the World Cup was last week.
@realmohamed1 Lmao. What I meant is, it's sad that our chances of winning the treble came to an end because of some fat fuck from Schalke.
@realmohamed1 Still think if Jese was fit &amp; on his Jan-Feb form we would've won the league.
@realmohamed1 Maybe, but he's deffo better than Carlo in that aspect. The way we bottled the league last year was embarrassing.
@realmohamed1 Meant the way he handles such tight schedules. Like when we beat Barca with our B team before we knock out United.
@realmohamed1 A certain Portuguese mastermind is needed for these kind of situations.
@EatenApplee Haha, I know. Meant a harder one about our history and shit.
@realmohamed1 Agree, one German in the lineup is already too much for opponents to handle.
@realmohamed1 Unfortunately true. That was the lineup that I'd pick.
@realmohamed1 Navas Arbeloa Nacho Pepe Coentrao Silva Khedira Isco Jese Ronaldo Hernandez.
Someone needs to do one for Real Madrid. Will ace this shit.  
@NotAManCantona GB is untouchable &amp; Perez has made it clear that he's the future of the club. As for Isco, fans will riot if he leaves.
@NotAManCantona 150 each leg + your best player.
@IlIarramendi Isco &amp; some bald head.
@Chase_Ryan No, he's shit.
@mediocentroEN @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Pinto covered more ground in the return leg vs Atleti last year lmfao.
@mediocentroEN @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ OK. Who was more vital ?
@IlIarramendi Scoring a freekick on ️Casillas &gt;&gt;
The mole will definitely consider committing.
@KineticKroos And yes, I'm willing to see that happen just to prove a point.
@KineticKroos Still want him to leave tho. Would be unreal when he knocks us out from the CL next year &amp; makes all the doubters look stupid.
Bale love on my timeline &gt;&gt;&gt;
@Noncerano @lucasammr He's just ridiculously fat &amp; stupid.
Some cules are actually opinionated.
@realmohamed1 Bale tracked back a lot.
Great goal tbh.  
@KineticKroos The cunt mentions me &amp; then instantly blocks. Nice technique to run away from a fight IMO.
@KineticKroos The rage IS real lads. 
@NotAManCantona Even Barca's fan base do.
AHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH 
@RMadridEmilio Fans &lt;3
@HoIyCris Messi was literally offered a blank cheque by Man City.
@realmohamed1 Nah, but he scores a lot &amp; has cool hair so I don't see how that can be bad.
@KineticKroos Oh, well. Ricardo Rodriguez was my preferred choice before they linked Gaya with us.
@YasenMadridista Not official yet.
We missed out on Gaya...
@rioferdy5 Thoughts on Chicharito?
@mediocentroEN Maybe not Deulofeu but Jese definitely has the potential to be one. Would've said Nolito but that lad is 28.
@mediocentroEN Jese &amp; Deulofeu.
Fucksake. 
@UltraSuristic Delete LMAO.
@realmohamed1 @Rikabi3li He'll pull a Solskjær.
@Rikabi3li Chicharito scoring in the CL final &gt;
@IlIarramendi @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ ffs
@IlIarramendi @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Bale won us 2 titles in his debut season. Ozil is a assist merchant ,forever in the shadow of Silva.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ @IlIarramendi Maybe, Silva is tho.
@IlIarramendi @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Mata &gt; Ozil
@IlIarramendi @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Nice try. Bale prime tops all 3.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ I really don't.
@IlIarramendi @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Hazard is better than Isco...
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Yes lmao
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Hazard.
Hazard.
Well deserved, KaneLAD.
@TouchOfKroos Don't have a problem with the lad being racist, it's just that he keeps on mentioning some Basketball team.
@ToniKroos @realmadrid @dallasmavs Fuck is wrong with you?
@Illarra24 Just do us a favor &amp; fucking commit.
@realmohamed1 Spartan LAD is decent defensively on his day. He's a better crosser than Carvajal too. Embarrassing.
Nolito completely dominated Carvajal today. 
One could argue that fatigue was the problem, didn't look like it tho. Worrying.
@mohilparekh Atleti.
@realmohamed1 @Jeinnylizarazo Yeah, that was sad. Didn't he remarry tho?
@realmohamed1 @Jeinnylizarazo Perez is one horny old prick, he'll listen to her.
@IlIarramendi I know he won't. Wants to seal the Pichichi race.
@Jeinnylizarazo @realmohamed1 Translate LAD.
@ViveLosDeportes @sopitas 
Messi will be rested against Getafe midweek.
We play Almeria at home, hope Ronaldo sits this one out FFS.
Carvajal has been terrible. Worst player on the pitch...
Chicharitoooooo
@EvokedUnited He has been the better signing...
@realmohamed1 James or Messi?
HAMES IS the best player in the world.
MY SEX MASTER JUST SCORED
KROOOOOOOOOOS
Illaramendi you fucking piece of shit
Isco set to make his 100th appearance in a Real Madrid shirt. Bargain of the decade IMO.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 We might not even win...
Hope Mourinho gets stabbed.
@VamosJese @bernabeudigital Lmao, we beat Barca with Essien playing as RB.
@VamosJese @bernabeudigital Well, we did sign Essien at one point.
Ramsey unreal
Sanchez decision making is terrible.
Ivanovic is ridiculously good.
@IlIarramendi Ozil best 10 in the world
@IlIarramendi You turned against Bale...
Wenger trying to rustle Mou LMAO
What a ball from Cesc.
Henry dropping them hard hitting truths.
@KayLMurray Comeback to Real Madrid TV bae.
Torino score the 2nd lmfao
@mohilparekh He's fantastic on his day. Can't dictate play but he's physical presence is needed against us.
@DareToJese Average. Been watching for 15 minutes &amp; they're struggling to create chances.
@Rikabi3li Yes lad &lt;3
@Rikabi3li Doubt that'll matter if we get a positive result in Torino. Them leaving spaces behind in the Bernabeu is suicidal.
@Rikabi3li Heard its not likely.
Watching Juve play, lmao they're irrelevant without Pogba. 
We're definitely in the final.
Di Maria benched again. State of bae since he left...
@TouchOfKroos @iStanForDamon @SocialRMadrid Yeah lmao that too.
@iStanForDamon Thinks Kaiser Franz is better than Pele.
Kroos just confirmed that he's a racist.
@realmohamed1 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Lmao I think he learned his lesson.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ 6817 left to reach your old followers count.
@realmohamed1 @HAMEZRODRlGUEZ @VaraneRelated @Mubaaaarak @OsamaRahhal9 @EatenApplee Lmao he basically said that we're nothing without Luka.
@realmohamed1 Bar the dive that was a decent performance. Look at how active he was, he kept on causing us trouble down the right.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ @VaraneRelated @Mubaaaarak @OsamaRahhal9 @realmohamed1 @EatenApplee AHHAHAHA GOOAAAAAAAT. Analysis on point.
Unbelievable how Bale managed to bully us at the age of 20. 
@IlIarramendi Ye, always said so.
United should go for Jese instead of Depay. 
The latter is a fraud &amp; Jese is easily twice the player.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Touch wood FFS. Need that fat businessman alive or else we're screwed.
@realmohamed1 Yeah that's the problem. Japan &amp; Australia deffo already have 2 seats reserved.
@NotAManCantona Will be playing in the World Cup.
@realmohamed1 Nah, won't be watching because I'll be playing in it.
World Cup ffs unreal times. Can't believe that I won't be around to watch the next one.
League is lost bro :( — It ain't over until the fat lady signs, mate. 
@3liRikabi Called up for trials at Castilla soon. Need to revise the other offers tho.
@3liRikabi Just kidding SMH, Iturbe unreal since his Porto days. Quaresma had twice the potential &amp; ability tho.
@3liRikabi Quaresma was said to be the heir to Figo when he played with Sporting. Iturbe is a wanker. Big difference imo.
@3liRikabi Remember when he was heavily linked to us?
@3liRikabi Was counting on them to end Juve's domestic dominance. Shame they turned out to be frauds.
@3liRikabi Also, they're just dog shit in general.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Lmao DM link goat, need to hear the hard hitting analysis.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Lol did you find your interview with them?
@IlIarramendi Lmao did you abuse Iniesta?
@realmohamed1 OK
@realmohamed1 EPL broadcasts keep on getting interrupted.
Bein Sports....
City bottling cunts.
@realmohamed1 True, would let Modric sex me no questions asked.
@realmohamed1 If it wasn't for Twitter neither would I. Varane is his teammate tho.
@IlIarramendi Bale &gt; James &gt; Griezmann.
Get mad.
@IlIarramendi James &gt;&gt;&gt;
@IlIarramendi GOAT performance.
Modric wishing his little daughter a happy birthday but forgot Varane. Lost bit of respect.
@IlIarramendi Don't remember but I'm pretty sure it was shit.
@IlIarramendi Agree dominated the midfield.
Javi Martinez back from injury. MOTM in the 7-0 thrashing.
@IlIarramendi @OsamaRahhal9 @Mubaaaarak @RealMadridLeb You don't even know him lmao
Can't wait for Bayern to liquidate Barca.
@JessieWhiteD10S Wasn't a penalty lmao. Handball on Neymar I think.
@HAMEZRODRlGUEZ Will get rejected. Perez needed.
Ødegaard benched? Hmmmm.
@Iscoeh SMH.
@BlancoStats Ye obviously. Barca 5-0.
If Espanyol manage to pull this off tho....
Heda got suspended on his main lmaoooo
@Giroudesque Best in PES too
@realmohamed1 @MadridVoice Disrespecting a club legend like that...
@MadridVoice Not funny.
@realmohamed1 Most of the experts are sad virgins, my knowledge &gt;&gt;&gt; Alex Sandro is great but I heard Arsenal are after him.
@realmohamed1 Thought we're talking about Alaba and not Roberto Carlos FFS.
@realmohamed1 He's my preferred choice, deal deffo not happening tho.
Haven't heard any Gaya rumours for the past week or so. Need to sign the lad before he renews, cba missing on another bright prospect.
Walker FFS.
@FergieTimeMUFC Bale isn't joining mate...
@realmohamed1 Well, yes. Just don't see us bottling this opportunity.
@RahatRMadrid That's just creepy af
@IlIarramendi Illara is our 7th choice midfielder, actually in tears.
@IlIarramendi Illara goat but needs to retire ASAP.
Happy Birthday to the future GOAT. 
@realmohamed1 
@KineticKroos Fatso used Ramos as a RB in the 2nd leg too. Match in Turin was a disaster for Varane, the worst performance I've seen of him.
Just remembered why we struggled against Juventus in the group stages last season. Ancelotti started Illara &amp; Khedira FFS.
@realmohamed1 What a lad he was. One fat mug down, 2 to go.
@realmohamed1 DEAD.
@sranjum @realmohamed1 He doesn't like Indians.
@BlancoStats Thanks in advance mate!
@realmohamed1 Lmao wtf. I'm trying to hook you up and you still try to abuse me? Fair enough.
@Datcapitan @FutbolSergi @3liRikabi @BlancoStats @LeahVdc @realmohamed1 He's single too.
@OsamaRahhal9 No.
@realmohamed1 Won't be surprised if fatso plays Ramos in midfield from time to time after his performance against Atleti.
@realmohamed1 @Illarra24 Tank &amp; Batman leaving in the same transfer window. RIP squad depth.
@UltraSuristic Could he by any chance make it back for the CL final should we reach it?
Gundogan to United apparently. 
Perez should try his best to get the Verratti deal done now.
@realmohamed1 @Illarra24 Yes lmao I've always wanted Batman to retire but you're a huge fan.
@realmohamed1 @Illarra24 Ouch.
@Giroudesque Hazard living off his dribbling abilities, lmao would gets his ankles snapped on his debut in Spain.
@Giroudesque Scored the CL winner in his first season &amp; scored the greatest goal of all time in El Clasico's history lmao
@atamaster123 If we play with the same mentality we played with against Atleti, I see us progressing regardless of what Juve have to offer.
@SemperIiber @lucasammr Never seen. Many abuse him for being fat tho.
@SemperIiber @lucasammr Lmao blocked me for calling him fat. Lad just can't handle the hard hitting truths.
The day @lucasammr dies would be biblical.
@SemperIiber Douche move from him.
@H41DER_H_ Happy Birthday idolo
The thought of Bale scoring the CL winner for the second consecutive year is just inconceivable.
Thoughts on the draw goat? @GarethBale11
@AbziNemo Pique has been better in 2015.
Neuer, Carvajal, Pepe, Pique, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, Isco, Ronaldo, Messi, Robben.  
@realmohamed1 No Pogba = No problem.
We're winning the CL lads.
@RahatRMadrid Robben will be back.
P

YASSSSSS SECOND LEG AT HOME
YASSSSSSS
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Bayern Madrid
Juve Barca.
@SocialRMadrid Barca, Bayern, Juve
In that order.
@NotAManCantona @PossessionStats That best striker in the world. @CH14_
@3liRikabi ok
Gameiro!
Spectacular from Hulk.
FFS, Zenit are back in this.
@OffsideLiam Definitely bitter.
@PossessionStats @NotAManCantona Didn't say that.Things could've been different if we didn't get a positive result at home. Confidence boost
@PossessionStats @NotAManCantona His pass to Coentrao prior to Benzema's goal was what decided the tie.
@realmohamed1 Fair enough. If anyone deserves a chance it's Navas after all.
@realmohamed1 Need to see Dave in action every week. Paki can play in CDR.
@realmohamed1 ....
@EatenApplee @Maryy_RM @Rikabi3li @VamosJese LMAOOO how did you even find that?
@RahatRMadrid FFS, need him to follow me first so we can make the arrangements.
@realmohamed1 Doubt it, he's playing at home.
@ThierryHenry @Cristiano Lmao just commit you cunt.
Henry the cunt bitter as per.
@DareToJese @iStanForDamon He won't. Isco will play in Luka's position. James will play behind the BBC.
@DareToJese @iStanForDamon Against Barca? No way. Was a disaster when he played there against them.
@DareToJese @iStanForDamon Not really. Ramos as a midfielder was only for this match.
@Pherson24 Lmaoooo won't mind doing that if he does manage to win the double.
@iStanForDamon Hard. That'll be unreal if it happens tho.
Changed my mind, screw the league. A second consecutive CL success would be historical.
@realmohamed1 Remember when you doubted James lmao?
@KineticKroos Deal is a deal lads.
@Routinho_ Chicharito IS the best striker in the world.
So happy for Chicharito. The lad must've been dreaming about this moment all his life.
CHICHARITO IS BETTER THAN SUAREZ.
CHICHARITOOOOOOO
Whatever happens, Hala Madrid.
@3liRikabi Bunked Uni?
@EatenApplee It's written in the stars.
@OsamaRahhal9 Lmao makes sense, I guess.
@EatenApplee Don't exactly remember but I think it was in the first 30 minutes.
@OsamaRahhal9 He's better with the ball than Pepe but I don't trust him in Defence, let alone in midfield.
FFS, please don't attempt any reckless 80 yard diagonals. @SergioRamos
@realmohamed1 Meant that he scored in the league deciding game. Anyway, why isn't Gabi starting?
@OsamaRahhal9 Because he has a good reputation playing there. But Atleti &amp; Barca are quite different so will have to wait and see.
@OsamaRahhal9 @SocialRMadrid Wanted Pepe there.
@TheNewBlackGuy Same lad.
FFS  
@KineticKroos I still don't forgive the Frög for bottling that chance. Early goals are huge in matches like this.
I'd genuinely stab myself if one of the lads miss an early clear-cut chance like Ozil did against Dortmund in 2013.
@realmohamed1 Harsh, the tank won us the league in 2012. Batman needs to go back to fighting crime.
@realmohamed1 That'll crush them mentally tho. They might consider retiring ffs.
@Iscoeh @RahatRMadrid Your brother.
@realmohamed1 Even with Modric &amp; Kroos missing you wouldn't want one of Silva/Illara/Khedira to start? Lmao the trust is real.
@leylahamed Not optimistic tbh. Think tonight will be a disappointment.
@FCBJULIAN3 He cancelled out Messi in the CDR final &amp; CL first leg when he played there.
Really worried about Kroos getting booked and missing the semis. No Modric &amp; Kroos against Bayern/Barca will be ugly.
@H41DER_H_ Seconds.
@DezilDez True, but Pepe is terrible with the ball and can be a liability if he plays in midfield. Huge risk.
@Pherson24 Lmao I don't hate him. I just don't trust him in a match of this magnitude.
@mediocentroEN How many of the 7 Madrid derbies have you watched this season?
Seeing Chicharito in the lineup makes me pessimistic. The scenes when he's the one to score the winner...
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Only if Kroos is given freedom to move to the final third IMO.
YAAAAAAASSSS 
@H41DER_H_ Hope you lose your tickets.
@UltraSuristic @BarcaKnight @FutbolSergi That's what he said.
@UltraSuristic @BarcaKnight @FutbolSergi He didn't lmao. Just made a new account with the same old handle.
@DezilDez Thanks Sherlock.
Bale, Quaresma, Isco, Modric &amp; Kroos.  
@SemperIiber True. Hating on him has become a new trend within our fan-base.
@3liRikabi @realmohamed1 Agree, Soccer unreal sports. It's funny that we were expecting a sextuple. Barca on the right path for Treble now.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Same. De Gea Danilo, Gaya &amp; hopefully Reus will take us to a whole new level.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi LMAO, looks like the most realistic scenario.
@3liRikabi Not worried about Celta for some reason. The Sevilla game will be the most intense/vital game we played against them in years.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Exactly, it's a strategical risk.
@realmohamed1 Well, it'll be understandable if we did after what Atleti made us go through this season. Wouldn't want my team to party tho.
@3liRikabi True but we have to be realistic. It'll be hard to compete for 2 titles with these circumstances. We CANT finish trophyless.
Why are Bayern even celebrating reaching the semis anyway? That shit must be normal for them by now.
@3liRikabi If I know for sure that we will recover mentally &amp; physically for the remaining league fixtures, I won't mind getting knocked out
What a cunt Muller is. Can't believe I've always wanted him to join. 
@3liRikabi Let's just hope we don't concede at all. Wouldn't mind if this goes to penalties tbh.
@3liRikabi No one can question their mentality. It's just that whatever they do up front won't matter if we concede.
@Mourinholic These vines won't change the fact that they've embarrassed you in your own home.
I miss the time when it didn't matter who got injured as long as Ronaldo didn't. It's ridiculous how reliant on him we were in the Mou era.
@3liRikabi Hames.
Bit of Suits
@3liRikabi No worries, BatmanLAD will fill the void.
@3liRikabi Griezmann the biggest threat. Need Pepe to bully him.
Who would you start for tomorrow? — Iker Carvajal Ramos Varane Coentrao Pepe Kroos Isco James Ronaldo Hernandez. 
@Giroudesque CR, Raul, R9, Henry, Drogba.
Bayern Barca semi final should be interesting. For me the match is decided before it's even played.
BAYERN!
@realmohamed1 @BrazilStats Thinks he's Brazilian when he doesn't even know the language. Another fat Lebanese btw.
@realmohamed1 @BrazilStats Don't even remember. Think I mocked him after Germany ended Brazil.
Still dreaming about the day @BrazilStats unblocks me.
@realmohamed1 FFS, alright. Nacho is decent anyway.
@realmohamed1 Hummels is overrated, I find Dante underrated. AfroLAD wouldn't mind the bench &amp; wouldn't cost as much as Hummels.
@realmohamed1 He's dominant aerially &amp; I like his style.
@realmohamed1 Unreal accurate 80-yard long balls. Just remembered tho, the EU passport rule wouldn't allow the deal to happen.
@realmohamed1 We should go for him if Pepe leaves.
@SemperIiber @mediocentroEN He would've been Pep's 1st choice CB if he didn't get injured.
@mediocentroEN @SemperIiber 
6 actually. Schweinstiger, Robben, Ribery, Benatia, Alaba &amp; Javi Martinez.
@SemperIiber @mediocentroEN They have 6-8 starters injured...
Need Bayern to go through tonight. Call me childish but I can't have this terrible Barca reach the finals.
@realmohamed1 @aarbeloa17 This shit is getting serious. Perez needs to terminate his contract ASAP.
Cerezo taking the piss as per. Will this cunt ever grow up?
FFS @aarbeloa17 , leave Kroos alone you SOB. 
@RahatRMadrid @MrAncelotti Convincing as in dominant. I want to see them suffer after what they've done to us this season.
@RahatRMadrid @MrAncelotti Lmao yes. I also said we need to do it with a convincing performance.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Should've given me a shoutout.
@deni_rivera Bae
@MrAncelotti LETS GO! YOU FAT SON OF A BITCH
@RM_Insider Shave that thing which you call a beard.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_  "What's a Paki like you doing here?"
@3liRikabi At least we had a decent bench back then who turned around the match when they came in. We literally have no one now.
@3liRikabi Lmao seriously tho. Our situation back then wasn't actually bad. Alonso the thug was the only absentee.
New motivational upload needed @LuisCalles9
@3liRikabi @DipeshKaphle111 @RM_Insider You think so?
@3liRikabi @RmadridInfo He actually won't. Strict 'No Nig-Nog' policy at the club.
Watch Ancelotti play Kroos behind Illara tomorrow FFS.
@3liRikabi @RmadridInfo Still wouldn't make our current XI.
@3liRikabi @RmadridInfo <NEUTRAL FACE>
@realmohamed1 @RmadridInfo Never see him play. Ain't 65 like you.
@realmohamed1 @RmadridInfo By the looks of it he's just a shit Lassana Diarra.
@RmadridInfo Fuck is he?
what is your prediction for the games tonight — BarcaPSG. 3-1
BayernPorto. 4-1 
@3liRikabi True, I just have trust issues with Ramos. He gives possession away so easily, Simeone will use this to their advantage.
@realmohamed1 Pepe the LAD at his best. Fouling players left and right.
@realmohamed1 2-1 league win. Remember his outside of the foot pass to Morata?
@3liRikabi Thought about that too. Pepe has been tested there before. Ramos looked clueless when he played there against Barca last season.
@Raki_Taki @SocialRMadrid That's exactly why I want this formation.
FFS can't find a compilation video of Pepe's Beckenbauer-esque performance against Barca in 2013.
What I've been asking for.  
@realmohamed1 He has 3 chins...
@realmohamed1 
@realmohamed1 Meant long hair.
@3liRikabi @RahatRMadrid You sound optimistic about us reaching the semis.
Ancelotti might consider Pepe in midfield after all. He definitely reads my tweets.
Happy Birthday to one of my favorite footballers of all time. @isco_alarcon
@DareToJese Thank
@DareToJese Hope so.
Shit just got real with Ancelotti.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 @UltraSuristic I like the idea. Could be risky but it's a risk worth taking IMO.
Pretty much.  
@Iscwoah That pic is old.
@Iscwoah Nah
@Pherson24 @RahatRMadrid @MadridVoice If we draw Juventus in the semis.
@Giroudesque Neymar
@RMadridEmilio @Raki_Taki Bale before CR &amp; Modric before Robben.

Defence: Varane, Pepe, Ramos

Midfield: Coentrao, Isco, Kroos, James, Carvajal

…
But yeah, we are going to make this happen. We need the 12-13vsB…
Imagine thinking that Atleti are the favorites against us. Will still batter them with half of our starters missing.
@UltraSuristic No
RIP @IlIarramendi
@KarimB92 Klopp isn't even half the manager Mourinho is. We went for Mou after he won the treble, Klopp's team is chillin at mid table.
Didn't Yokozuna say that Benzema will be ready for the 2nd leg? 
I'm so done with this fat lying mug.
@RahatRMadrid @MadridVoice Don't forget Bayern. They're definitely pulling the comeback off IMO.
@RahatRMadrid @MadridVoice Yeah I gave up on the CL. League is still very possible.
@RahatRMadrid @MadridVoice We're not definitely ending trophyless.
We're screwed.
Ancelotti suffers from Gynecomastia.
Disappointment of a fixture.
Unreal ball from Shaqiri
Lopez MOTM
Goal is disallowed.
Mexes ffs
@8ball_ Do you think Arbeloa deserves the death penalty?
@realmohamed1 List** FFS.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Lmao you think he'll stay?
@realmohamed1 Lmao ikr why is Pastore chillin in that lost? Verratti/Hazard would be unreal but won't mind Reus.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Good, I hear the places in Manchester are nice.
Perez will probably go for the most expensive &amp; unnecessary player. Pogba.  
@3liRikabi Lmao he should just build a home movie theatre like Messi.
@3liRikabi Think Carlo is watching this?
@Mourinholic Your dad.
@BarcaChief @coffingould Are you trying to be funny?
Callejon unreal
#BienvenidoReus
@ToniKroos Sex me
@ElMadridismo93 ....
@RahatRMadrid If you seriously think that then you might as well stop supporting this club when Modric leaves.
People making it sound like we're nothing without Modric, FFS.
@RM_Insider Why are you talking to yourself lmao you dumb?
@3liRikabi @RM_Insider Remember when you had him in your avi? SMH.
@3liRikabi @RM_Insider That's the thing, he never will. Someone needs to show him a compilation video of midfield Pepe against Barca.
@3liRikabi @RM_Insider That's my preferred XI too. Given Pepe in midfield a thought?
@Giroudesque 11/12
@Merengue_Bites What will our ideal lineup be against Atleti?
@realmohamed1 @tjcope FFS.
Modric <BROKEN HEART>
@RahatRMadrid @RMConor Exactly.
@RMConor Top 3? SMH.
@realmohamed1 He looked rusty whenever he played. Getting 10 minutes every month killed him.
@realmohamed1 You can criticize him as much as you like but you can't take away from him the fact that he's a fighter.
@realmohamed1 I'm serious. Rather have him play instead of Illara &amp; Lucas doesn't seem ready.
@realmohamed1 Wasn't talking about him.
@realmohamed1 Time for a certain German to step it up.
@EatenApplee Jese to save our season.
Modric needs to make it back on time for the CL final. Cba winning it with him watching from the stands.
@EatenApplee Lmaooo
Not trying to be a dick but why can't Messi pick up an injury? Small one. Just sit out one game FFS.
Now imagine if we hadn't sold that cunt Alonso. We would be chillin at the top of the table &amp; have him replace Modric against Atleti.
@Madriddiction @SocialRMadrid Fat fuck giving false hope as per, hope he gets released.
@sranjum I don't trust Silva/Illara for that role in a match of this magnitude.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Yes
@LFCHadouken Last season.
Modric &amp; Bale out for the derby.
@zMaestroMo Not about the first one.
@zMaestroMo Yes. Chicharito IS better than Ibra btw.
@realmohamed1 Fuck. So he's definitely out for Atleti.
@EatenApplee No one did.
@realmohamed1 Extent of his injury?
@NotAManCantona Neymar is having a dream season, he wouldn't have scored half of his goals if it wasn't for Messi tho.
@PossessionStats Unbiased truth.
@NotAManCantona Have you seen him in 2015? Immense workrate &amp; unreal playmaking skills.
James IS better than Neymar. The day you fags stop rating a player based on his dribbling abilities it will become obvious.
James MOTM. Ronaldo superb performance and Chicharito was unreal.
@FCBJULIAN3 Are you fucking retarded? He attempted a back-heel pass which failed.
@FCBJULIAN3 Messi never did that tho?
@PossessionStats It's actually sad because he shits on Neymar.
Isco never performs against Malaga FFS.
That offside trap tho.
RONALDO YOU LEGEND
Bale's season over.
@HoIyCris This isn't funny. Hope you realise that this is serious.
Bale injured!
Fat Ronaldo is in the Bernabeu.
@VaraneRelated Reus isn't better than Hazard you mug, stop trolling.
@realmohamed1 If he stayed there for one more season he would've had the best season in the Premier Leagues history.
@VaraneRelated Thanks Sherlock.
Miss seeing Bale tear up the Premier league. We need to loan him there for a season so he can remind the doubters what he's capable of.
Fuck just happened?
.@EatenApplee Hazard.
Reading LMAO!
@Mourinholic 10 men PSG knocked you out.
@EatenApplee Isco, Bale, Neymar etc will never dream of winning a Ballon D'or if he keeps playing like that.
Perez needs to do whatever it takes to sign Hazard. We're missing out on the future GOAT.
Hazard's penetration &gt;&gt;&gt;
Would let him penetrate me.
@realmohamed1 Was talking about the midfield &amp; attack smh. Looking forward to how this plays out.
@WisssamHaidar Lets just hope he breaks a leg.
@RMadridEmilio Our best player didn't play.
@realmohamed1 Illara started instead of Modric.
@realmohamed1 Iker staying anyway, cba with more goalie drama.
Don't think we've started with this formation before. We tried it for 20 minutes against Depor earlier this season &amp; I liked it.
Dea Gea turned into a fraud.
Hazard!
Arbeloa starting tho. Just when I thought this day couldn't get any worse.
Valencia is everywhere.
If this formation works well Benzema will join Chicharito on the bench for the remainder of the season.
@realmohamed1 Rehearsal for Atelti
@JeseRodriguez10 Loan soon.
Alexis!
De Gea the stupid mug thought it went in.
@VaraneRelated Fuck off before I block you for good.
@Mourinholic Going for 6-9 your mum.
@Iscwoah Ancelotti's fault.
Griezmann having a better season than Bale. Enough is enough, the cunt needs to step up his game &amp; do something against Atelti, or else...
Griezmann the cunt.
@3liRikabi I honestly don't care anymore. Atleti will spread their legs for Barca.
@Illarra24 Just fucking die you useless piece of shit. Not the time for your aids.
Watch Valencia beat us now.
@fantastlsco @DaniParejo Hope you get it too.
I FUCKING HOPE YOU GET CANCER @DaniParejo

What about Parejo today? ht…
@3liRikabi Yes.
@3liRikabi Gaya game changer in second half.
Valencia fucking bottles
@VanGaald Shaw is unreal. I rate Cahill for some reason.
FFS Gaya isn't starting. This match is fixed, Valencia WILL throw the game away.
@VanGaald De Gea Shaw Terry Cahill Ivanovic Matic Herrera Di Maria Hazard Rooney Costa.
@LFCHadouken They will win. Poverty league.
Bayern playing with their C team.
@EatenApplee Messi hattrick. Definitely not trying to jinx.
@EatenApplee Same, Barca 4-0.
Los Murciélagos.
@FCBJULIAN3 Tough one, right now Suarez is miles ahead of Bale but Bale is younger and will only get better next season.
@SemperIiber Wasn't serious SMH.
@SemperIiber Nostalgia? I do miss his presence as a person but not as a player. Ozil is great but the bald lad is on another level.
@SemperIiber @addidas Ozil is 1/16 of the player Zidane was.
@3liRikabi @realmohamed1 Probably goes there just for the Nachos &amp; Popcorn.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi If we lose the league that'll be on Ancelotti. Heard he likes to spend more time in the Cinemas than at work.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi FatLad is busy securing signings for next season. Ain't complaining.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Yeah, Valencia as well. This tough phase requires fatso's experience &amp; wisdom which I doubt he uses.
@3liRikabi The sooner they drop points the more chances of us winning the league. Don't see us dropping points against Sevilla if we're 1st.
@3liRikabi Barca will suffer.
@DareToJese Yeah I heard that. Let's wait and see.
Enzo Perez &amp; Piatti don't make the Valencia list for tomorrow's trip to Barca after all.
@realmohamed1 Got blocked for calling him fat earlier today. Hard hitting truth.
Oh FFS. 
@FCBJULIAN3 He can. Has more hattricks than Bale &amp; Benzema combined this season unreal.
@FCBJULIAN3 Pedro is your best forward. Hattrick tomorrow.
time riding a bike, with my father behind me
grabbing my hips
Which movie do you think is overrated? — 50 shades of Grey, Star Wars sequel, Super Man returns &amp; The Hunger Gam... 
Suarez might miss tomorrow's game? 
Don't know how to feel about this he usually bottles in league matches.
Rooney as DM tomorrow? Hmmmmmmmmm.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi That's what I'm best at.
@3liRikabi Agreed, Lika is unreal.
@fantastlsco @elchiringuitotv Trust them on this one.
@Aarozga @fantastlsco Your mum.
@fantastlsco 
@fantastlsco Heard the latest news?
@fantastlsco Goodbye Dave.
@SocialRMadrid @SocialRMadridEs @UltraSuristic @RM_Insider @RonaIdoStats @BaIeStats @ModricEdition @CR7Designs Thanks mate.
Unreal nap
@lucasammr Do you also blame the board for being obese?
Nadal unreal bottler
Ferrer unreal
@ElMadridismo93 So he can't trust him to play 90 minutes without picking an injury? He's not made out of glass.
@ElMadridismo93 Wouldn't it have been more sensible to give him some minutes before he starts him against Atleti?
@LucasNavarreteM Opinion or fact?
Our seasons depends on you lads. @valenciacf
@realmohamed1 Definitely, looks impossible tho.
DEAD. 
@BlancoStats Yes, my bad.
@BlancoStats Yup. Greatest assist of all time.
PirateLAD. 
Ancelotti thinks he's funny. Want to see him laugh once we terminate his contract this summer.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Will fav this tweet just incase.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Fucksake Heda.
@realmohamed1 Yeah, you're Mr nice guy when it comes to players safety. Heda will probably throw a party if it were to happen.
@realmohamed1 Wouldn't be too worried about him on the field as much as I'd be off the field. He's definitely getting stabbed if he flops.
@realmohamed1 Especially the bald one. Needs to stop being too generous.
@realmohamed1 Great, because it worked well in the last 7 games.
@realmohamed1 Shouldn't he be planning a master plan to knock the thugs out?
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 What does that have to do with anything? Atleti had a perfect campaign &amp; Barca had their moments.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 We fucking play against MESSI &amp; Simeone. If you can't see the difference then I cba arguing.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 You seriously crediting him for winning the Bundesliga? I'm out if that's the case.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 Why do you keep mentioning Porto? I'm talking about his 2 years in Germany.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 Why would I be bitter you mug? Have nothing against him.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 And don't forget that Bayern have the best bench in the world.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 Carlo is to be blamed for his lack of rotation but he's sometimes forced to play the same players.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 We play in arguably the toughest league in the world. Pep plays in a 1team league. He's to blame for the injuries
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 If he's half as great as you think he is the least he can do is reach the final this year.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 Mind explaining?
Tie over!
Hamsik with the 3rd.
@realmohamed1 Not talking about his attitude but about the fact that he'll fail for the second consecutive year in the CL with that squad.
Can't wait for the main man Franz to test Pep's chin. Shame he's too old now.
@realmohamed1 Told you that the bald head is a fraud &amp; will fail with Bayern.
Calleti's hair always on point.
@realmohamed1 It dropped since then but was still acceptable up until 2012.
Higuain's finishing was never the same after 2012.
Bayern want Griezmann? Don't seem them getting both of De Bruyne and Griezmann.
@UnaiEmery_ Please don't be a pain in the ass when we play you.
@NotAManCantona Heist of the century.
@OsamaRahhal9 What kind of smile is that?
Pipitaaaaaaaaaaaa 1-0!
@AtharvaGautam WTF? No .
@AtharvaGautam No, just in general.
Fav for Gotze 
If you're a male &amp; shave your legs/arms tell me so I can block you.
@OsamaRahhal9 So you're British?
@fantastlsco Gifted knowledge &gt;
@OsamaRahhal9 @rmpundit @H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 That rmpundit is definitely your second account.
Imagine ready a book. 
Your life must suck.
@OsamaRahhal9 Lol fu. I have connections with sheiks here ngl can deport your ass back to Japan so you can resume your sumo wrestling career
@realmohamed1 @OsamaRahhal9 @H41DER_H_ Yeh.
@OsamaRahhal9 @H41DER_H_ how can I lie about my name and nationality if I never even mentioned it. Seriously can't wait until I deport you.
@OsamaRahhal9 @H41DER_H_ The only thing you can beat me in is a food contest &amp; you might even lose that because you just suck in life cunt
@OsamaRahhal9 @H41DER_H_ Fuck off cunt. Will spoil your face If I ever see you.
@OsamaRahhal9 @H41DER_H_  HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF #SPOILERALERT FFS?
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 FFS are we still discussing Arbeloa in 2015? I thought the debate on his relevancy ended a while back.
@realmohamed1 Lol. What a creep that man is tho. I'd be worried if we lived in the same city.
Kroos would definitely ditch us if Dallas Mavericks offered him a contract.
@fantastlsco I said that we will win. Didn't know that 7 of our starters will miss that game.
@fantastlsco If Valencia keep pushing for 3rd Barca will suffer and drop points against Atleti. Can assure you that.
@fantastlsco My team is second and two points behind Barca who have a harder schedule left. Why shouldn't I be confident?
@fantastlsco Keep telling yourself that. Didn't you laugh off the possibility of us winning the CL last year?
@SocialRMadrid Navas Coentrao Pepe Ramos Arbeloa Modric Kroos Isco BBC
@fantastlsco Does the league count as "nothing"?
I used to disagree with all the criticism and hate Luiz gets for being 'overrated', not after yesterday tho. The dude is shocking.
@BeIIerinho @OxToBox Lmao mate I doubt you ever left your house let alone watch the greatest team ever perform.
@mediocentroEN Do you want them to dominate football FFS?
@BeIIerinho @OxToBox Lmao no you haven't.
@mediocentroEN True, unreal fraud. Isco twice the player.
@OxToBox "Plastic glory hunting" 
Lmaooooooooooooooo just fuck out my mentions
@OxToBox @MessiMinutes How much more of a dumbfuck can you be? It's not hard to see that he regrets leaving us.
@BarcaChief If you had Maldini &amp; Puyol in their prime playing you would've still lost. Bale too good.
@MessiMinutes He defo misses life in Madrid.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Any defender in the world other than Arbeloa would.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Still wasn't 1/8 of the player he is today. Imagine Arbeloa marking Pedro now, let alone Messi.
Varane IS worth 130 million according to some journalist high on weed. If Varane leaves, anything less than 180 million is unacceptable IMO.
@kriskisso Same. It's obviously not happening tho, just stupid rumors.
Gifted left foot. 
Isco is joining Barca lads.
@FCBarceIena @RahatRMadrid Must be Rakitic then. Either way, I couldn't care less.
@Divijfx @FCBarceIena Defending your internet crush? She won't send you nudes pal.
@FCBarceIena @RahatRMadrid Your mum is overrated. You probably watch Barca because you think Pique is hot lmao drink bleach.
@H41DER_H_ Nah, No CDR = No CL. Bale saved our season.
@H41DER_H_ without him we would've finished trophyless last season.Carlo would be sacked &amp; we will be chillin at bottom table with Zizou atm
@H41DER_H_ stfu don't take that away from him ffs. The bias is real.
@SocialRMadrid @DiarioBernabeu Will support Chelsea.
@BlancoStats @EatenApplee It's true. I'm probably Benzema's biggest fan but he's the one who usually flops the most against them.
@EatenApplee Benzema*
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 
@Pherson24 Nah. It'll be more magical when he does it in the Bernabeu.
@RahatRMadrid .....
@H41DER_H_ That's not a problem. Expecting a brace from him.
@mediocentroEN Nah. He's racist just like Ancelotti
Bit of Flash.
Need this celebration on Wednesday. 
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Lmao after all you've done he should file a lawsuit against you.
Did I unfollow anyone else by accident? Tell me if I did FFS.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Lmao I did? Mistake.
@3liRikabi We're winning the CL btw.
@3liRikabi Oh ffs, you made your point. That early penalty changed the scenario of this match tho.
@KineticKroos Same goes for us too btw.
Bayern WILL go through.
Quaresmmmmaaaaaa sex me
@3liRikabi Haha, at least wait for the final whistle.
QUARESMAAAAAAA
@DareToJese Find out for yourself tonight.
@DareToJese He's shit.
@DareToJese I wouldn't if Verratti was playing. Huge blow for them.
@3liRikabi The only thing he can finish off are his meals.
@3liRikabi Fight me
@3liRikabi We couldn't beat Villarreal's B team. I know that the circumstances will be different but wouldn't say that a win is guaranteed.
@3liRikabi Didn't say win, but compete. Wouldn't imagine a walk in the park if we play them in this state.
@DareToJese 0-3 Barca
@3liRikabi Which can still compete for the title.
Lmao Bayern's XI doesn't look bad at all. People made it sound like they'll have to play with their B team tonight.
@PossessionStats Thank god. You over exaggerate sometimes with your unjustified hate towards him.
@PossessionStats Rakitic or Rafinha?
Average bald headed cunt 
Fuck is a Rabiot?
@H41DER_H_ Just been told that Arbeloa died in a car crash. An incident which is perfect for humanity in every way.
Need you to sumo wrestle Burgos next week @MrAncelotti
@SemperIiber He obviously won't. He might not even stay.
@OsamaRahhal9 Like dancing with Indians and beating them in Ferrari world?
@OsamaRahhal9 Lmao what plans? You deffo sitting at home wanking.
So Gaya is a pretty much done deal. Hope he lives up to the hype.
@OsamaRahhal9 <PENSIVE FACE>
@OsamaRahhal9 @realmohamed1 Next Wednesday.
@OsamaRahhal9 No.
@FCBJULIAN3 Waiting for Messi to get Neymar's haircut.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Agree. The Bale I know would've probably dribbled the keeper and scored. Anyway, he'll redeem himself next week.
@FCBJULIAN3 Lmao never knew. Doesn't look that bad.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @OsamaRahhal9 If Moya started yesterday we all would be kissing Bale's ass right now.
@FCBJULIAN3 WTF. When did he get that tattoo?
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @OsamaRahhal9 Nah, read it backwards. You and the mug who keeps faving should go for it.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @OsamaRahhal9 Do you know the term etavitcaed ?
Mastour in a few
@3liRikabi @realmohamed1 @OsamaRahhal9 Yup, that's what I meant. He'll be more of a wingback. Hope Carlo goes for it.
Torres trying to fire shots at the Bernabeu. Looking forward to his reception there.
@realmohamed1 @OsamaRahhal9 Yeah, that's why I asked. Think Isco will start in the return leg.
@realmohamed1 @OsamaRahhal9 Thought you meant what you wanted to see?
@realmohamed1 @OsamaRahhal9 Where is this Isco hate coming from?
James is definitely bisexual.
@UltraSuristic <NEUTRAL FACE>
@OsamaRahhal9 Deffo should. Can be a risk but I do trust Klopp.
@UltraSuristic Nah, need him here.
@Alikhair7 You don't have to. I don't see Reus sticking around if Klopp goes. Same goes for Hummels &amp; Gundogan.
@KineticKroos While we are it we can sign Klopp when Carlo goes to City.
We're actually signing Reus lmao
@RahatRMadrid "With great power comes great responsibility"
I love Mandzukic again.
@RahatRMadrid MidgetLAD. Need you to pee tonight during Barca's game.
I'm a fucking moron.
@TheNumber10Role @PossessionStats For Messi that wasn't hard at all. On any other day he would've buried that in.
@Pherson24 Maybe.
@TheNumber10Role Lmao still bottled the final.
@Goalnaldo @fantastlsco Coming from "Goalnaldo"
@SocialRMadrid No chance of Nacho playing. If Coentrao isn't fit Arbeloa will start.
@fantastlsco You're embarrassing. Yet you call Julian obsessed...
@TheCRonaldoFan Lmao you didn't have to.
@TheCRonaldoFan @RahatRMadrid @MrAncelotti Loooooooooool mate just stop, you're embarrassing yourself.
Was worried about Kroos getting booked and missing the 2 leg.
@TheCRonaldoFan @MrAncelotti What does Ancelotti have to do with us not being able to finish our chances? Are you retarded?
@TheNumber10Role Ok stop bragging.
@H41DER_H_ Stop the fucking aids
Marcelo missing the second leg. So done.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Fuck you Oblak 
Varane.
#HalaMadrid
Haven't been this nervous since the CL final last year.
All I ask for from Carlo is to keep the tie alive until next week. If he can't at least do that then he's definitely not fit for this job.
@Pherson24 Just being realistic.
We're screwed.
Lineup in 10 minutes. Shitting bricks.
Drafts ready for tonight lads. 
@realmohamed1 Exactly, in the 'home' derby. They're twice the team when playing at the Calderon. Many of our starters can't handle pressure.
@realmohamed1 We both know the most likely scenario of tonight tho.
@realmohamed1 If we get a negative result tonight the only person to blame is Carlo &amp; you know it.
@realmohamed1 Seriously tho, I can already see it. Will lose tonight with half of our players performing bad &amp; you'll still blame GB for it.
WTF ever happened to quoting retweets? This new update gave me aids.
@realmohamed1 He might not perform tonight. Lad saving his goals for next week in the remontada match.
@realmohamed1 Find out for yourself tonight.
@realmohamed1 It's fine tho. Now we have Bale for that.
@realmohamed1 Ye remember the pressure before that game, especially after Falcao's equalizer. Thankfully we had CR in his prime.
@KineticKroos Unreal how Diego Simeone managed to transform them within 2 years.
Back when Atleti weren't such a pain in the ass. 
@fantastlsco Lmao. You'd give up one of your kidneys to see them both play in one team.
@RM_Insider At least get your facts straight...
@garith_bale11 Fat and stubborn.
@mediocentroEN Delete.
Pretty much 
@SemperIiber He'll get isolated on the far left. Has always been the case against them away this season.
Looks like fat fuck will stick with the usual 433. Does he ever learn?
@victorSmoses @SemperIiber How I'm i being deluded? Coentrao was our main LB last season and still performs better than Marcelo defensively.
@victorSmoses @SemperIiber Are you retarded? The only reason Conetrao doesn't compete with Marcelo is because he's injury prone.
@SemperIiber @DaniCarvajal92 If Chelsea don't snatch him that is.
@victorSmoses @SemperIiber No definite starter. They'll battle it out for that starting spot just like Benzema &amp; Higuain used to do.
@SemperIiber @DaniCarvajal92 Lmao our best RB of all time &amp; future captain.
@H41DER_H_ @rmpundit @ShraddhaKapoor FFS. That mug keeps on begging.
@IlIarramendi @H41DER_H_ Agreed.
@IlIarramendi @H41DER_H_ Agree. Lmao Arbeloa walking the guy around Cone thinks he runs the place.
@IlIarramendi @H41DER_H_ Guy kept begging for Bale to come out. Lad was probably in there wanking.
@TheRamosHeader Saved by Ramos &amp; Bale.
@IlIarramendi Unreal knowledge lmao
@realmohamed1 He apparently used to block any Madridista that popped up on his timeline. Anyone who disagreed with him was blocked too.
@realmohamed1 Agreed. Got all emotional and shit today 
@lucasammr Missed your tweets on my timeline you fat bastard! Thanks for unblocking m8.
The LAD has finally unblocked! 
Bit of Game of Thrones &amp; Suits.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Don't see us winning both. I fancy our chances in the league if we beat Sevilla &amp; Valencia which are scheduled in CL weeks.
@Loconte1990 @valenciacf_en @MustafiOfficial Oh, will have to wait and see. Thanks anyway.
24 hours from now the rage will be real.
@Loconte1990 Are you retarded? He's missing the next game.
@KineticKroos League should've been the priority since the start of the season. Winning it once in the last 6 years is embarrassing.
I won't mind getting knocked out of the Champions League if it meant that we can put our full effort &amp; concentration on the league.
Mustafi will miss the Barca game. Luck is just not on our side this season.
FFS, Hierro couldn't stop flirting with that fit chick.  
@fantastlsco Sky sports pundit in a few.
@KineticKroos Dumb fuck Carlo thinks it's Fifa. He once tried to dominate Barca in the 3-4 Clasico Lmao what a stupid cunt.
@KineticKroos Maintain possession and in return would set up the team in a well disciplined manner to defend, especially in the away games.
@KineticKroos Attack &amp; keep possession which we struggle at doing without exposing the back. Mou used to give the opposition the freedom to
Imagine thinking we will win the league under Ancelotti. My main problem with him is that he never respects the opposition. Always wants to
Big fan of the doubters going back to kissing Bale's ass after tomorrow's game.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ At peak he was unplayable in the box. All he needs is good service and he'll win you games.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ Falcao*
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Nah wants Bale. He's a huge fan.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Agree. Benzema deffo needed on the bench tomorrow.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 DS will probably eliminate Modric from the game by putting 2-3 thugs on him. It's up to Isco/Kroos to step it up.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 As a unit they're not. It's always the individual errors which cost against them. I'll be more than happy with 0-0.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Lmao my point is that we should keep the tie alive until second leg. There's no chance of us not conceding tomorrow
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ He always pulls an 'Illara' against them, they dribble past him like he's not even there. I'll start him in 2 leg.
@TheRamosHeader James/Benzema.
@rnadridreal Yes, get mad.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ This season deffo top 3 crucial against anyone but Atleti.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Well that didn't work in the 4 matches he played there this season. He'll have defensive duties assigned by Fatso.
@Madriddiction Exactly. His explosive bursts on the left &gt;&gt;&gt;
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ Anyone other than Marcelo. Would've started Coentrao but he's probably dead as per. Arbeloa LB won't be bad either.
@rnadridreal Marcelo is great offensively  (which will be useless tomorrow btw) but is shocking when it comes to defending.
@IsmailPatel_ He defends better than Marcelo.
@H41DER_H_ Lmao just zoom ffs
Not trying to troll. This is my preferred XI tomorrow. We won't be able to score so we might as well play on counters 
@H41DER_H_ @SocialRMadrid No Isco RIP.
@realmohamed1 Is fat &amp; Lebanese a trend here? Hasan deffo chubby.
@H41DER_H_ @SocialRMadrid Haven't done it in 3 games there this season. No hope.
@realmohamed1 @BarcaChief Chief is Fat FFS, Alex is just fatter. You also accused him of being fat stop trolling.
@H41DER_H_ @SocialRMadrid Imagine thinking we will score against them at the Calderon.
@SocialRMadrid 2-0 Atleti.
@realmohamed1 @BarcaChief Lmao ain't fat/Indian.
Hope Gaya &amp; Piatti make it back on time to face Barca. Our season could depend on these two.
@HoIyCris Subway.
@BarcaChief Fat Indian.
@realmohamed1 @revistadelaliga Yeah you always seem to try this. Ever got lucky?
Oblak starting tomorrow? It's not like we will even reach their goal or anything but Oblak can be a huge liability for them.
@revistadelaliga @TerryGibson88 @BumperGraham Why is Ancelotti such a clown?
@realmohamed1 @revistadelaliga No.
@16LucasSilva Our best DM.
@BlancosCF Bale can play in a 4-4-2 formation.
Getting blocked by your idol &lt;
Unblock FFS @RM_Insider
@KarimB92 They will obviously, but so will we.
@3liRikabi @UltraSuristic Trust me, you don't.
Kun!
@rnadridreal I'm talking about a possible scenario which might happen this Tuesday.
Derby, home team dominating, manager probably getting sacked in the morning. This could be us on Tuesday too FFS.
Bring Di Maria on FFS
Young second assist of the game.
Okay this is getting embarrassing.
Clear offside.
Mata!
Hart unreal!
What a baller Herrera is.
@Alikhair7 Obviously what I meant.
Young &gt; Di Maria.
#HardHittingTruths
Young is unreal ffs
FELLAINI!
Unreal unintentional pass form De Gea!
YOUNGGGGGG
OLD TRAFFORD...Stand up and shut up.
Kunnnnnnnnnn
@EvokedUnited Not staff.
@H41DER_H_ Been to OT more than the Bernabeu?
Class act.  
Hamsik 2-0.
@NotAManCantona Scored the winner after being in Barton's pocket for 87 minutes.
@VanGaald Lmao true. Unreal business from the Russian mug.
@VanGaald They've pretty much wrapped it up after today.
@3liRikabi Kane close second.
CESC!
Fellani 87th minute winner. You heard it here first.
@IlIarramendi @fantastlsco FFS, point is.
Breaking Bad would've probably failed without Jesse.
@fantastlsco @IlIarramendi That's true for most of the shows. GOT however is different. Remove 50% of the cast &amp; it'll still succeed.
@IlIarramendi @fantastlsco Arguable. Without Jesse Breaking Bad wouldn't be half of the series it is today.
@fantastlsco You should. Will make Breaking Bad look bad.
@UltraSuristic Oh, damn. Haven't thought about that.
@UltraSuristic Well, ain't complaining.
@jaackmatthews9 
@fantastlsco Fuck that. Game of Thrones is back.
@UltraSuristic Were HBO supposed to release all 4 today?
First 4 episodes of Game of Thrones leaked? 
FFS I have an exam tomorrow.
2 hours of sleep FML
Mina subbed off. Could've scored his 5th.
@3liRikabi Nolito or De Bruyne?
@Madridate @H41DER_H_ @sranjum Agreed. Will be remembered as a legend.
Paco Jemez is so naive and stupid. What good is beautiful football when you can't get results? Man is always on all-out-attack mode.
@3liRikabi He can do it. If the rhythm doesn't drop he might get his 6th.
If Mina scores his 5th....
@H41DER_H_ @sranjum @Madridate Solid game from him today. Once in a lifetime experience this is.
@3liRikabi 
@3liRikabi Yeah I remember. Think Ronaldo gave him his hattrick match ball after that save in 2011/2012.
@3liRikabi That Iker needed this Tuesday. Unreal if he wins us the league/CL in his last season.
@Madridate WTF. Cavani is my man but Bale is the 3rd best in the world.
CAVANI.
@3liRikabi Alright good talk
@3liRikabi Do you always have to break in the bad news?
This guy.... 
I'm happy.
@minute9248 League.
@KineticKroos WER'E WINNING THE LEAGUE LADS!
Danilo scores again!
@dermotmcorrigan A draw will do tonight.
Cba with this shit league anymore.
Weligton gets his 5th Ellie and missed the match against us.
Griezmann the wanker
@realmohamed1 Will batter them IMO. They don't have Cazorla anymore to score a 90th minute freekick equalizer.
@realmohamed1 We play them next FFS.
@RahatRMadrid @IlIarramendi And caused famine in Spain.
Nothing personal but the day when Shanta's heart stops pumping blood to his vital organs &gt;&gt;&gt;
@realmohamed1 @JLSanchez78 @aarbeloa17 Isn't he like Arbeloa's boyfriend who gets all the leaked info?
@realmohamed1 @JLSanchez78 @aarbeloa17 Spanish wannabe.
JESEEEEE
Pepe killed Navas
@OsamaRahhal9 Ikr
@H41DER_H_ It's true
@IlIarramendi Truth
FFS ILLARA. Never seen him intercept a ball. Opponents pass through him like he's not even there.
@H41DER_H_ Delete this.
Lewa again!
Isco you fucking magician.
@yousef738 @FutbolSergi What deflection?
@H41DER_H_ It's true, maybe after Kroos.
Arbeloa unreal assist. Our best crosser.
CHICHARITO
I missed this ngl
FINALLLY
Fuck just happened lmao?
FUCKKKKK
Is it just me or is Arbeloa a more consistent crosser than Carvajal?
Chicharito cute af
@OsamaRahhal9  So hilarious<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@OsamaRahhal9 He IS your twin, so you can't be any different.
Thiago's technique &gt;&gt;&gt;
Lewaaaaaaaaa
I've come to the conclusion that James is better than Gotze.
Dortmund already concede FFS.
@fantastlsco Probably, hence the 'IF'.
If Barca drop points tonight we will win the league. Just a theory.
Need Jese to grab a goal today.
@mediocentroEN If you're talking about peak then obviously. We would survive without Ronaldo but can't really say the same about Modric.
@mediocentroEN Couldn't agree more. Hope that you mean he's second to Modric tho.
Chicharito IS about to fuck shit up.
@mediocentroEN Do you rank Bale in our top 3 players?
@mediocentroEN You a closet Real Madrid or nah?
@fantastlsco He wouldn't have if Bale didn't have discomfort. We wouldn't even have appealed.
We should play with this XI against Atleti.
CHICHARITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IS ACTUALLY STARTING
Are you right handed or left handed? — Right. 
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @Oficial_RC3 *Less
@3liRikabi @Oficial_RC3 It's because I'm black.
@3liRikabi @Oficial_RC3 Agreed, deserves to bang.
Happy birthday to the man who defied the laws of Physics &amp; exposed that fraud Einstein. @Oficial_RC3
@3liRikabi Scores a couple of tap-ins and thinks he's peak Van Persie now.
Chicharito's girlfriend is wife material.
What a wanker  
@Wrighty_8 That wouldn't work. With Modric &amp; Kroos sitting deep you'd need Isco/James to create play. Bale/Cuadrado are poor without service
@fantastlsco He probably will unless fatso talks some sense into him, which I doubt he will.
@fantastlsco He's not 26 anymore. Even he understands that he'll need to rest every once in a while.
@fantastlsco Lmao if you think he has a say in this.
@fantastlsco He may not even play you mug.
@3liRikabi @IlIarramendi He lost some weight in summer, you serve bad food in Canada?
@3liRikabi @IlIarramendi You should've stabbed him when he came to Canada last summer.
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi Greatest of all time, forever making the middle eastern's rage quit unreal.
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi Actually...
@H41DER_H_ Any news on the release date?
Ask me a question | 
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 SMH, how would you win a race if you don't know where you're running to?
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi Deffo serious question. Both have non existent pace.
@IlIarramendi Lmao. Arbeloa or James? Who would win in a race?
@IlIarramendi The Flash needed
Rage is real from Mustafi.
@3liRikabi I'm Douglas Costa mate.
@3liRikabi Never rated anyway, proper thug.
@3liRikabi Same
Aduriz needed. Shame he's 34.
@rmpundit Are you begging for a block or nah?
@NotAManCantona 8.
The morons who have BOTH Chelsea &amp; Real Madrid in their bios disgust me.
@NotAManCantona If we keep singing a Galactico every season then obviously no. He's probably leaving this summer on loan.
@draxlar Messi probably winning it this year.
@NotAManCantona I was obviously bantering. You should sign Jese.
@draxlar Bale is winning us the CL pal.
@KineticKroos Lmfao Haddadi, what was I thinking? Halilovic/Odegaard instead.
@KineticKroos 1 correct, 9 to go.
@realmohamed1 If Casemiro returns then Silva is getting loaned out. With Illara possible departure I think we will go for that vine player.
@Behzinga You're fat tho
@HoIyCris That's were he'll end up if Barca reject him. Hasn't signed the deal yet.
@realmohamed1 Both scenarios sound equally terrible. But if him leaving means that we will be signing a midfielder, I want him gone.
Khedira to Barcelona. That'll give me more reasons to want him dead.
DDG Shaw Kompany Jones Zabaleta Toure Herrera Di Maria Silva Rooney Aguero.
Dirty 
@VanGaald DDG Shaw Kompany Jones Zabaleta Toure Di Maria Silva Rooney Mata Aguero.
@TheAncelottiWay He doesn't have 100+ assists.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Already did
@realmohamed1 Nah, would take him over Yokozuna tho.
@OziIFC Too bad you're losing him to Atleti this summer.
@realmohamed1 Hence the 'LMAO'.
Despite their problems he should've included Pepe/Ramos. Cunt of a man.
Odegaard's attitude is worrying. I blame the media for creating all this hype &amp; making him look like the next GOAT. Zizou needs to fix this.
Lmao at Mou's best coached XI.
@IlIarramendi @H41DER_ You're dead to me.
@YourMomBot idk man
@NotAManCantona Regardless, I'd rather have him miss our next match and not risk getting his 5th card before we play Valencia/Sevilla.
Why on earth would we appeal CR's yellow?
@RahatRMadrid Coentrao for Marcelo.
@H41DER_H_ Game of Thrones...
James WILL score in the CL final.
@realmohamed1 Huge liability when he's in the last man situation. Lacks confidence.
@RahatRMadrid @IlIarramendi Thug Life. I'd take him in 2-3 years, don't think he's ready yet.
@IlIarramendi He's wank but will give him his more or less 'deserved' chance.
@IlIarramendi Zidane is bald tho, not a fan of bald/fat people. Rodgers needed.
@IlIarramendi Agreed, been saying since day one. #FatsoOut
@Madridate Yours too IMO.
@IlIarramendi What did he do/say?
When Modric chills on one of the posts while defending a corner  &gt;&gt;&gt;
Need to bed Carvajal someday. Had a bad first half but one moment of brilliance from him won us the game.
Iker MOTM.
BALE'S PACE IS UNREAL
JAMES &gt; MESSI
JAMEZZZZZZ
CARVAJAL
Deffo appealing.
@EvokedUnited 3rd best in the world.
@EatenApplee Why not? Luka has been our worst player in the first half. If he keeps playing the way he did its only logical to take him out.
@EatenApplee No one for now. James/Modric/Bale if the score doesn't change in the next 10-15 minutes.
@EatenApplee Funny how you always mention Bale when 4-5 players are under performing.
Marcelo, Carvajal, Modric &amp; Bale...
@H41DER_H_ Clearly has pressured him.
Carvajal has been average in 2015.
@realmohamed1 Choke* FFS
@realmohamed1 Granada match was perfect for this experiment.
@realmohamed1 Surprised that Carlo hadn't considered using Jese as a 9 instead of Benz.
@realmohamed1 Will. Need a goal fiesta tho.
Rayo will open their legs for us tonight as usual by leaving spaces behind. BBC needed.
@Wrighty_8 Isco or James in your ideal Madrid XI?
@OsamaRahhal9 Nah, arguably the most knowledgable guy on here. No bias whatsoever. Sending him nudes soon.
WRIGHTYLAD, people just can't handle his hard hitting truths.
@Wrighty_8 BALE YES LAD
@ElMadridismo93 I'm sure Kroos has 8.
@dermotmcorrigan RIP
@PossessionStats Yeah that's my point. Hence why I said its a disgrace if he forces his discomfort in an easy game like this.
@PossessionStats Isn't he still suffering from discomfort in his toe or something? Could be huge if he forces it.
@PossessionStats Lmao won't be surprised if he pulls a Ronaldo and gets a lengthy injury when in pursuit for goals and records.
@PossessionStats Disgrace if he isn't rested.
@Giroudesque Arbeloa.
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi Proof needed IMO.
@IlIarramendi @H41DER_H_ DEAD. Imagine fanboying over a player you didn't even know before World Cup.
@realmohamed1 Messi always makes the difference against them. Minor injury needed.
@realmohamed1 Valencia, with or without Gaya, are a bigger threat IMO.
@fantastlsco Not really. He IS your best defensive midfielder when he puts his shit together.
@fantastlsco Midfield in shambles without Carrick.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 His calmness in front of goal &gt;&gt;&gt;
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ His** FFS.
@TheOscarRole Isco.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Needs to change club IMO. Will get him back in 2-3 years when one of the 2 begs upfront leave.
@IlIarramendi @H41DER_H_ @VaraneRelated Same lmao.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Because none of them get less than 10 minutes of playing time each week.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 Maybe true, but so is Sterling, Pogba, Ramsey, and 92% of the other young prospects in Europe.
@H41DER_H_ @realmohamed1 L-M-F-A-O K-Y-S.
@realmohamed1 @H41DER_H_ Never understood how Granero made it into our club.
@H41DER_H_ Silva has the potential to become one of the best in his position. Granero is just some pirate wannabe. #difference
@H41DER_H_ Aids.
@VanGaald Don't see him leaving before the summer of 2018. When he joins you he'll play as a proper poacher and net 30-40 goals.
@VanGaald 2018. He'll win you the league before he goes to MLS.
@VanGaald @Cristiano He IS returning after he fulfills his contract.
@FootballFact101 @soddsb Top Banter!
@HoIyCris FFS.
@realmohamed1 Hope they leave him stranded on some island.
@realmohamed1 He fled to Thailand, what a pussy.
@realmohamed1 Death needed.
@realmohamed1 Miss that formation tbh, Bale is a must tho.
Bale doubtful for the trip to Rayo, what is life.
@ahmedgazarin @ClassOfMessi @RMadridEmilio Ahahahahahahahha, still hurt because I made fun of how deformed you look?
@ClassOfMessi @RMadridEmilio @ahmedgazarin Not really. He's just some expert-wannabe who tries to look cool by hating on all our players.
@ClassOfMessi @RMadridEmilio @ahmedgazarin Lmao why are you bringing that cancer patient into this? Couldn't care less what he thinks
Unbelievable how inefficient Navas is. Nasri in five minutes has contributed more.
@ClassOfMessi @RMadridEmilio @Jayzinho11 Lmao, Bale IS the 3rd best player in the world.
@realmohamed1 smh 
YAYA!
Danilo just scored. Jizzing.
Yaya has regressed.
Palace!!!!
@realmohamed1 Credit to Gerrard for slipping.
@realmohamed1 The mediocre red-eyed bloke.
@OsamaRahhal9 Ideal? And what will that be lmao.
@OsamaRahhal9 Good, cba with finding you a new nickname.
@OsamaRahhal9 Hope you get eaten by sharks there. Btw, when did you lose so much weight?
@OsamaRahhal9 Lmao when did you go  Thailand?
@OsamaRahhal9 When was that?
@NoLaughingMata LMAO, no way. When was that?
@SocialRMadrid Bale in his debut season, 21 goals 16 assists. Unreal.
@realmohamed1 Yeah that was pretty weird. Think he regained his confidence now and 'should' be able to constantly score.
@realmohamed1 He needs 5? Then he's definitely achieving that. Needs to score some crucial-title-deciding goals tho.
@realmohamed1 Bale should score a couple before the seasons ends. Cba with him scoring less than he did manage in his debut season.
@realmohamed1 @SocialRMadrid Not impossible, highly unlikely tho. Should try to score 2-3 goals in the Getafe, Eibar &amp; Malaga home games.
@SocialRMadrid This season was his chance to break Messi's record of 50 goals, he bottled it with that shit form at the beginning of 2015.
@Wrighty_8 Fancy our fat lad?
@RahatRMadrid This is better imo 
@realmohamed1 SMH. Should convince him to join.
@rmpundit @realmohamed1 Stop begging.
@realmohamed1 That's what I keep asking myself, they're the only two German-speaking people in the city of Madrid probably.
@RahatRMadrid Deffo, man weighs 900+ pounds.
@RahatRMadrid Hope he trips and Ancelotti falls over him.
@realmohamed1 Same. I'm afraid that Kroos will decide to commit before the season ends if this continues tho.
Again and again ffs. 
@IlIarramendi @Arbaeloa LITERALLY DEAD
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi He actually can't. Aids pace and dribbling abilities.
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi Without Isco we will probably be in the relegation zone.
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi Ronaldo &gt; Isco?
AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi DEAD. Agree tho, Game of Thrones probably best series of all time, BB is nothing show without Pinkman.
@H41DER_H_ @IlIarramendi YESSSS bae
@IlIarramendi BB easily overrated series of all time.
@realmohamed1 Screw that. League needed this year, if he fails to achieve that I'm expecting the double next year.
@realmohamed1 Perez? Deffo. He may have ruined our season but I trust him to make it up for us next season.
@3liRikabi Remember when you had a crush on 97% of the girls on Twitter? Good times.
@3liRikabi Remember when Federer dominated everything? Good times.
@realmohamed1 He's second to this LAD. 
@realmohamed1 You have a man crush on him, just admit it. You always talk about his looks too.
@realmohamed1 I'm actually surprised by the fact that you have James in your AVI.
@realmohamed1 Your avatar lmao
@btsportfootball Do one for United.
Why is 'Breaking Bad &gt; Game of thrones' still a thing ffs.
Suits in a few
YAAAAAS LAD, thought I was the only one. “@ElMadridismo93: @KineticKroos Tempting but no. Done it several times watching Modric tho”
@Wrighty_8 He'll most probably retire here. Future captain &amp; legend.
@ElMadridismo93 Did you ever try to wank while watching a comp video of Isco's skills?
@HoIyCris You'll get suspended.
@RahatRMadrid @RMadridHome You like Bale? Will buy you dinner no homo.
@RahatRMadrid @RMadridHome Imagine not thinking that I'm not the best Twitter account, let alone best Madrid account IMO.
@kriskisso Lmao ikr?
@BarcaKnight @PossessionStats @IlIarramendi @Wrighty_8 Benzema &gt; Your squad excluding Messi
@fantastlsco Neymar has been bad for MONTHS. Messi fed him 75% of his goals.
@IlIarramendi Ye but cba with his rat face on my screen every time Barca play.
@BarcaKnight @PossessionStats @IlIarramendi @Wrighty_8 Are you actually doubting Benzema's right to be in that list you mug?
@IlIarramendi Yeah he's so useless, can't wait until they sell him in summer.
@IlIarramendi Especially Suarez lmfao so shit and overrated for scoring against us
When I said Bale &gt; Neymar Suarez  no one believed me.
@PossessionStats @DareToJese @ahmedgazarin @SM_0141 His shoulder is offside.
@realmohamed1 Close.
@realmohamed1 Happening IMO.
Celta will upset Barca tonight.
Fav this.
@Madridate Salad? Lmfao you think I'm Ali?
Deffo Biryani.
@Madridate #PerksOfBeingAnIndian
@Madridate LMAO. Funny thing is that I didn't even know Nepal existed before last year.
AHAHAHHA YAAS GET IN LAD 
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @RM_Insider By Madridistas? That's new. Usually gets bullied by Cules on here.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @RM_Insider I'm blocked by him, so I have no idea on what's he ranting about.
@3liRikabi @realmohamed1 @RM_Insider Tell him to grow up &amp; unblock.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi @RM_Insider Unblock. Huge fan of your work &amp; legendary tweets.
@3liRikabi James needed, too good.
@3liRikabi Stfu
@RahatRMadrid Please do me a favor and stab him. Will pay you in advance.
@realmohamed1 You wut m8? 
@RahatRMadrid He's 14, fanboys over Suarez and is fat himself.
When I drop my hard hitting destructive truths. 
@EIPistoIero @H41DER_H_ @Wrighty_8 Even when he scored the crucial goals against us and City he was shit. Benzema &amp; Aguero outperformed him
@EIPistoIero @H41DER_H_ @Wrighty_8 Suarez has had like 2-3 'decent' performances since joining Barca. He's worse than Hernandez.
@EIPistoIero @H41DER_H_ @Wrighty_8 Benzema IS better than Suarez lmao you're so deluded.
We should play in the afternoon more often.
@EIPistoIero @H41DER_H_ @Wrighty_8 In tears lmfao Isco twice the player Suarez/Neymar will ever be.
agree 
@realmohamed1 Anyone but Bale IMO.
@realmohamed1 Get stabbed.
@realmohamed1 Who would you drop for Isco?
@realmohamed1 SMH, nvm.
@realmohamed1 Arbeloa last year since Bayern.
@FCBJulian We've been on top of the league for months and we weren't bragging about it 24/7 as we've won the league.
@fantastlsco Lmao.
Brace yourselves tho, the greatest meltdown ever is about to take place. @FCBJulian
Fivenaldo ammirite lads
FIVEEEEEEE
Comeback on LADS.
We conceded lmao
Marcelo IS the best fullback of all time.
@realmohamed1 Couldn't have missed this for the world. Wanking to this atm.
@realmohamed1 Him too. Modric scoring or Ronaldo getting his first 5th will be nice.
@realmohamed1 Bale needs to score again.
James assists twice on his return.
JAMES CHANTS YES BAE
JAMES MOTM
@realmohamed1 Best player today?
@IsmailPatel_ Nah. Rhythm will drop.
Benzemaaaaaaaa
Bale fuck me you're too good it's not even funny anymore
RONALDOOOOOO
JAMES ASSIST AGAIN!
Benzemaaaaaa!
Best striker in the world.
Would send James my nudes.
Prefect half. Benzema &amp; James scoring would be unreal.
Ronaldo fuck off Bale unreal assist
GOAAAAAT
@Rasad316 Isco.
This is what we've been missing, our left flank. Ronaldo James Marcelo deadly trio.
RONALDOOOO
@realmohamed1 James too good.
RONALDOOOOOOO.
JAMES UNREAL ASSIST
Arbeloa get the fuck off my TV you cancerous cunt.
Kroos you sexy bastard what an assist
BAAAAALEEEEEEEEEEEE AHHAHAHAHAHAHA 3 BEST IN THE WORLD
ACL needed @aarbeloa17
Arbeloa didn't score yaaassssssssss
James &amp; Marcelo <OK HAND SIGN>
@MartinGarrix Come Dubai you beg.
Bale needs to score a couple tomorrow to shut critics for a while &amp; regain some of his confidence before the Atleti game.
@realmohamed1 Fair enough. I'm not myself during our games.
@realmohamed1 Most probably sleeping at that time. No alarm in the world can wake me up.
@realmohamed1 2 in the afternoon.
Will commit if I miss tomorrow's game.
@EatenApplee Yeah if you're talking about how Bale has been this season he won't/can't bench Ronaldo. Talking about next season, new start.
@EatenApplee He had many great games where he didn't score/assist that went unnoticed. Ronaldo performed well in like 2-3  games in 2015.
@EatenApplee No he isn't lmao. He had his ups and downs but lacked consistency. Overall he has been better than Ronaldo since December.
@EatenApplee Nah, &amp; he isn't having a terrible season like our aids fanbase say. In many games he outperformed B &amp; C but isn't consistent.
@EatenApplee Talking about next season. Next season Bale will outperform every player in Europe.
@EatenApplee Ronaldo out &amp; Bale in.
@fantastlsco No lmao, Falcao &gt;
Turkish football fans are lunatic.
No offence to any of my Turkish followers.
<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@RMadridEmilio In general.
@RMadridEmilio @GildedReus Bale/Benz/James will all rotate with Reus. It's all up to him if he wants join. He's more than welcome.
@MecroReus Thought you'd put Reus first.
@RMadridEmilio @GildedReus Mate, he's 18 and not joining our first team next season. If Reus is signed then Jese will be loaned out.
@EatenApplee Talking in general but agreed with your list for this season.
@Giroudesque Bale instead of Hazard and agreed
@realmohamed1 Go away.
Rank: Bale Reus Neymar Hazard Robben
@RMadridEmilio @GildedReus You do know that Asensio will be loaned out for years before he joins the first team, right?
@RMadridEmilio @GildedReus SMH, that has nothing to do with Reus.
@Wrighty_8 Bale Ballon D'or soon or nah?
Charlie Adam.
Why does Hummels think he can can dribble?
#HardHittingTruth “@realmohamed1: Hummels not even the best CB at BVB.”
Lewa. Had to be him.
@realmohamed1 Used to be, he's dead to me now.
Why does this thug always slip when taking freekicks?
Bayern are a nothing team without Robben. Can't wait for us to batter them in the semis.
If we miss out on Alaba &amp; Gaya renews we should go for Ricardo Rodriguez. Haven't seen him much but IDGAF he looks solid.
I missed a lot didn't I?
Herrera!!!!
@EIPistoIero @FIaminisHair @TheOscarRole Except that I'm not lol. Denis Suarez &amp; Samper wouldn't make Real Madrid C's reserve bench,in tears
@EIPistoIero @FIaminisHair @TheOscarRole You're fat, #lmaodead
@TheOscarRole Are you fucked in the head?
@H41DER_H_ Delete
@fantastlsco So you want him to start regardless of his form?
Giroud!
Not that much of a donkey after all.
Fuck is Emre Can doing?
Standing ovation for Oz.
@PossessionStats Ramsey is better but you're exaggerating.
@TheCRonaldoFan Just don't tweet them at all.
DAT SLUM GUY
Sanchez!!!
OZZZZZZZZ BEST PLAYER IN BPL
COYG <SNAKE>
Thoughts?
@IlIarramendi I said maybe second to Kroos. He's definitely top 2.
@fantastlsco 
Cba with a draw today.
Don't want to see United get top 4.
@TreeAtTheBack Regardless, Bale IS the 2nd best player in the world.
This celebration '<HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY>' needed from Bale tomorrow.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 OK. Happy birthday.
If Sterling flops today he's dead to me.
Ancelotti wants to 'rest' Khedira LMFAO.
@realmohamed1 What does it say?
@SocialRMadrid When you realize that you've lost the league ^
That shit was scary “@FourFourTweet: Barcelona's treble winning team in 2009. 100% class. 
@3liRikabi Lol will toss him off the tallest tower here.
@3liRikabi Look who's back.
@realmohamed1 Yeah, think Ancelotti will give Varane's knee a rest after the run of games he played. Coentrao probably starting too.
@realmohamed1 Can see it happening. Easy opponent in the Bernabeu.
Arbeloa starting our next match 
@RMadridEmilio @Syed_Wajii @TheRamosHeader @Rahmatastic @thecrfazi @BlancosCF @Isco_AIaarcon @RMadridQueen @TypicalVijay  Thanks mate.
@Madridate @OsamaRahhal9 What a time to be alive
@OsamaRahhal9 And if you don't believe after all of that you can just ask @futbolsergi
@Madridate @OsamaRahhal9 Luka
@OsamaRahhal9 Training resumes on the 18th. Your ass is welcome to join.
@OsamaRahhal9 There is no one with that name, you're either Bullshitting or just retarded. It's easter break and there is no TS or matches.
@OsamaRahhal9 Lol who did you exactly ask?
@OsamaRahhal9 Are you retarded or retarded? I do have it on my jersey but I still have a real name wtf
@OsamaRahhal9 My teammates you cunt, that's it.
@ElMadridismo93 De Gea, Gaya &amp; Dzeko.
@OsamaRahhal9 Why do you always assume that I ask for your life story?
@OsamaRahhal9 My name is not Dcosta you cunt.
@OsamaRahhal9 Lmao you a defender? You must do a great job with that pace of yours.
@OsamaRahhal9 OK, mate.
@OsamaRahhal9 Were you the goalie or nah?
@OsamaRahhal9 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> WTF is that?
NAAAAAAAAAAAAH <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Will stab “@Harry_Styles: Looking forward to our show in Dubai. 
See you soon. H”
@fantastlsco @brbascript @realmohamed1 Excuses. Fraud.
@fantastlsco @brbascript How many lists do you have? 
@English_AS Woah.
@fantastlsco @brbascript I most definitely do lmao
@fantastlsco @brbascript Harsh.
@fantastlsco @brbascript Bugger off.
@fantastlsco @brbascript Imagine wasting your time on tweeting the entire script of a series.
@brbascript So sad
@elchiringuitotv @TopFGallardo AHAHAHAHAHAHA he has gone full retard.
@TheCRonaldoFan Ronaldo or Messi?
@Faisal_RedDevil @IlIarramendi Can't handle the truth?
@carrick_fan 163K tweets...
@EatenApplee 
@RahatRMadrid Wtf he's goat
@Madridate Lmao yeah. Ask him
@Madridate Lol he always hated him
@Madridate He doesn't rate Bale. He's dead to me.
@Madridate It hurts just thinking about it
Lester IS the best GTA character of all time.
@Madridate Will do. Cba with him sitting on me.
@Madridate Waiting for a certain Lebanese to argue about that.
FFS “@WORIDSTARHlPHOP: Bruh needs new ankles <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@Madridate FFS
@Madridate Would sex him if he wasn't that fat.
@Madridate Same
@Madridate Smoke what?
@BruMarquezine Reply you bitch.
@realmohamed1 I'm neither tho.
@realmohamed1 It wasn't short lmao, was just spiked up. Similar to Bale's now.
My hair finally looks like Bale's. 
Only took 7 months.
FFS. Didn't even know EA released an in-form card of Bale yesterday. Justice has been served.
@PossessionStats Was it when he denied Messi after Alves played a fantastic through ball? Yeah that was a great match from him.
@realmohamed1 Being serious. That's the kind of goalie who wins you trophies.
One of the best individual performances I've seen for a keeper. 
@realmohamed1 Going. Cba to wait for the downloaded version.
@KineticKroos Can you be my date to the movies? Will buy you popcorn. @BruMarquezine
@YasenMadridista Haven't seen yet. Don't spoil.
In a few. 
@fantastlsco 
@fantastlsco Thanks mate, unfortunately can't say the same about you.
@VanGaald Jupp Heynckes
Need to get myself on of those new selfie shoes.
@fantastlsco @realmohamed1 Why would you favourite your own tweet SMH?
@realmohamed1 Definitely is ngl
@realmohamed1 The flop will win us the Champions League again. Too easy for him.
@fantastlsco @OsamaRahhal9 @yasminebal This would've been bio worthy if it wasn't for the 'in red' part.
@realmohamed1 Had my doubts about Isco being able to perform for the entire season. Wasn't a fan of the winger version of Di Maria either.
@FootballFact101 Bayern will still dominate and batter Dortmund. No sweat.
@realmohamed1 
We're being linked with 13 left backs and 28 goalkeepers but with no forwards.
@realmohamed1 There won't be any heart breaking departures either. Well, Iker. But that won't be sad from a footballing perspective.
@realmohamed1 He is, but looks like this transfer window will be different.
@WelshBaller Ye, that doesn't mean that he's ready for first team football yet. He won't be given many minutes under fatso if gets promoted.
@RMadridHome Casemiro is officially my favourite human being.
@WelshBaller Not sure about Medran.
@realmohamed1 Wouldn't mind him too. Mandzukic would've been the ideal signing IMO.
@realmohamed1 True, but I don't think Perez is considering to sign a striker. Jese could be used as our back up striker.
@WelshBaller We're not getting Verratti.
@TheRamosHeader If we don't sign a midfielder he's deffo getting promoted.
@KineticKroos Vietto would've been unreal but that's definitely not happening after we signed Danilo. Wouldn't mind Dzeko/Aduriz.
Will finally have a strong bench next season. Need to sign a striker/winger tho. 
@MadridVoice @Goalnaldo @SocialRMadrid Exactly, I'd rather have Verratti/Gundogan.
@Goalnaldo @SocialRMadrid Thanks, Sherlock.
@SocialRMadrid #WelcomeVerratti.
@FCBJulian @OsamaRahhal9 Your mum will see what happens. When will you die?
@FCBJulian @OsamaRahhal9 You cancer patient. Why would we end the season trophyless?
@realmohamed1 We signed Navas before DLO left. If Iker is leaving for sure we should move for De Gea ASAP before he renews.
@IlIarramendi @TheOneAndOnly_5 Agree smh, Isco Modric Kroos our only hope.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 @IlIarramendi If the BBC put their shit together I see us progressing. They're the favourites imo tho.
@realmohamed1 De Gea next?
@TheOneAndOnly_5 @IlIarramendi Ramos always fucks up against them tho. Not confident without Pepe.
@TheOneAndOnly_5 Yo
Weather on point here<OK HAND SIGN>
@RMadridNation Yup, I'm definitely having nightmares tonight.
Arbeloa thinks he's relevant and that's what kills me. Can't believe that he'll go down in history as a World Cup winner.
@BarceIuna With boys at 3:37 am?
Haram stuff.
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Yeah, tough life.
@BarceIuna Who's here?
@realmohamed1 @3liRikabi Well, someone has to guard the house while they're asleep.
@Iscwoah What's his Insta?
