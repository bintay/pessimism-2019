But whatever. I'm happy, and I know miserable people hate seeing someone happy. So I guess keep talking shit, but really it's unnecessary ..
But until then, it's still nobody else's business. I'll never understand why girls are so concerned with my life. Like my life is boring lol
That's something personal in my life that I'll need to grieve and cope with and eventually let go of.
And just because I still love Jake doesn't mean I love Marc any less .. Jake was a huge part of my life, and he's gone now. Forever.
I'm so over people talking shit about me .. Just because I'm with Marc doesn't mean I don't still love Jake.
