when people say you're pretty but you know you're just hella good at doing makeup 
one last time
tattoos, piercings, &amp; she just learned how to twerk
possibilities and wants.
so easy to be optimistic and hopeful till you're thrown rejection and then it starts getting to you.
&amp; no matter how hard you wanna ignore it..it lingers.
always sucks when the things you want most don't happen.. and you're sorta stuck like do i continue the struggle for you or give up
do ya dance
dont stop, get it get it.

@Gee_phonk yee yee. knick knack paddy wack
@Gee_phonk now you do
@Gee_phonk yeah G, this shit happens
you eventually forget the smell of home since you're used to it and thats what people do to me
its my personality type to wanna LOVe and love and drown you in it too but then it turns into a smell that you get used too.
that goes in for all my friendships &amp; relationships. it's real exhausting but so is everything
the ones you love most will always do the least because they know what you'll do for them and its an endless cycle
dude its fucking fine. i realize so much now.
<EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN> indeeeeed

i've been looking forward and not back
the hood still fuck with me though.
asians will always have a place in my heart
just support me, motivate me.
dont make me feel crappy for having dreams.
i realize reality and the future is awakening and rude but its something i anticipate.. why do you have to try to ruin that strive
it makes me real sad when people knock and be little the things i want to do with MY life. i'll make it, i always do.
@DivineVillain awe luckyyyyy
