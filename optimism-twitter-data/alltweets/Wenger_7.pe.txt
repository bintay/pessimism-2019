I don't know why I do this to myself
Everything is just a business and everyone is just trying to get their cut
The day I realized that money actually did make the world go around it really depressed me
Who the fuck made up credit scores anyway. Cause that's exactly what it is made up bullshit
Thank god for my brother cause I know he would do anything for me and I'd do the same for him
I hate myself for the fact that I could have done more for myself in my life yet didn't
think what I'm more pissed about is I'd rather be told they don't want to help and not that they can't help
Is it normal for family to refuse to help or act like they can't when they really can
I feel like going on a rant but I want to be brutally honest
I think I need to go to a therapist
I think I already know
Maybe I try too hard sometimes
Great save but the way United is playing is just awful
Just have a sinking feeling
Well back to square one
Just even more for me to stay awake thinking about
I hate getting random headaches
The day the music died
Too much to think about to sleep
Just so many things on my mind
I don't know why I even try sometimes
a good old royale with cheese
#TeamMayweather just cause Money Team
@That_dude_GWEBB softer than 10 ply toilet paper
Where can I see the Mayweather Pacquiao without paying $100
