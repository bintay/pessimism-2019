@Kare84 Welcome :)
@MZAK_CLE Ha ha.
Weds....tomorrow 
@MZAK_CLE I still love looking at the Birthday pic from you and @joeymcintyre  :)
@HiDLine That part I didn't see.I still think if the NFL has this rule, all the people involved should be punished-publicly like #TB12
Exactly why we never really put away our winter clothes.... 
This makes no sense to me, either.  No sense whatsoever. 
#TWUG for D-Dub on #TWUGTUESDAY !!!  Oh, and a smooch to go with it :-* MWAH! 
@ChristopherSean I think I like your clean-shaven look better :) ;)  Either way, you're still a handsome guy :)

@MZAK_CLE that's my fear
@MZAK_CLE exactly! I also wanna know how much Vegas would cost!
@MZAK_CLE that is....if you guys are gonna go to Vegas!
@MZAK_CLE Vegas,  Boston,  Kelley's. I think we're leaving OH for BOS on the 12th. But if I can get a good deal,  I'll fly to BOS from Vegas
@MZAK_CLE I know right?  Lol I can make it work!
@MZAK_CLE no..the other way around. Boston is the weekend before Kelley's
@MZAK_CLE I know!  I'm gonna have to see about flights to Vegas! Oh,  and see if anyone else is going!
Damn you @NKOTB! I'm wracking my brain to figure out how to go to Vegas AND Boston that same week. @blockheadliv

@joeymcintyre HAPPY BIRTHDAY,  Blue Eyes!
@blockheadliv yeah it's really dumb-I talked to them personally&amp; they said everything has to be green, even with explanations
@blockheadliv it kinda sucks-they won't approve you even if you write explanations. You basically have to lie to fit in the green. How r u?
@Simply_MagPie @wickedcanadagal Happy Boxing Day!  I hope you had a very Merry Christmas!
@bigceee Don't get me wrong, I'll ALWAYS cheer for them! I'm a CLE fan all the way :-)

@blockheadliv absolutely! Those are the best kind!

@JoesTwstdDrm I walked away 20 min ago!
@JoesTwstdDrm Yep! Never fails!
@JoesTwstdDrm I watched the last Indians game-we lost. I didn't watch the Browns-we won. I partially watched OSU-hopefully they'll win!

@AllanFee Ditto
Where it all began-my first concert ever was @nkotb at Blossom. Here's the tix from Ticketron-remember Ticketron?! 
It's amazing 2 C all the @nkotb stuff I've saved: concert countdowns, trading cards, TV shows taped-on Beta, self-recorded Open House Party
Reorganizing ALL my @nkotb stuff....this is still one of my fav pics of @joeymcintyre 
Thank you @SaraBareilles for calming me down on my drive home! #December #Manhattan Can't wait to see you 10/12!
@HiDLine IDK what happened...stupid computers and techie things LOL
@HiDLine I've never had to do that before.  iTunes always just did it.  I think it's working now.I even got them to go on my phone.
@HiDLine Great....it's the original NK CD
@HiDLine I imported it into iTunes....
I'm going on Sunday! @ChrisVanVliet How is this Tribe game not sold out? All season long "fans" have been saying they want a winner.
I have an old CD I want to put into my iTunes....how do I convert a "CD Audio Track (.cda)" file into iTunes? And by old I mean 1994.
@blockheadliv @JordansFairCHER @sheluvsboston5 I agree!They would, too.That's Y I like having RD, LD-it can't get confused w/anything else!
@blockheadliv @JordansFairCHER @sheluvsboston5 Nope, and I won't. I have fought for too long to NOT be called a nutritionist!
PLEASE!!!!!!!   "@melissafranko: @joeymcintyre so proud of you, Joesie! Congrats! Next up - east coast...yes?! ;)"
Catching up on my DVR'd shows. Ariel Castro's sentencing is on-live at the time. Still mad he took his own life.
@HiDLine it's very nice :-)
@HiDLine lookn good Heidi! Who did it?
@joeymcintyre Damn you McIntyre! I'd be there if flights weren't $500 from CLE!  I hope you know we're all there with you in spirit.
@blockheadliv SO SORRY I'M JUST SEEING THIS!! How's it going? Can't really explain School Lunch in &lt;140 characters LOL
@joeymcintyre still have @BrunoMars DVR'd from Oct! Such talent! He's pretty sexy too!  Not as sexy as you tho ;-)
@HiDLine so wish i could see @joeymcintyre as #TheKid!  You look so happy!
Haven't been up this early on a Sunday since the last time I tailgated....off to the Muni Lot we go!
@joeymcintyre Have a great time out there! Miss you like cRaZy....pleeeeeeeeease come to the East Coast :-)
@JoeMacRules I can't believe it's only been a month. Feels like a lifetime ago. I'm Anxiously awaiting news of their next adventure!
@JoeMacRules I so wish I could've seen him...I miss all of them so much.  Crazy I know....I'm just glad I'm not alone with those feelings!

Just had someone knock on my door, asking me to sign a petition....its 9:00 at night! WTF? Sorry-I'm not in the petition-signing mood at 9.
I still find it amazing that Ariel Castro made national news. Never thought it would go beyond CLE. Watching more about it on @drdrew
@blockheadliv @JordansFairCHER @sheluvsboston5 @snaojj Me either...We'll have to see if we can get them yet!
@JoeMacRules just curious...when you got pics with him did you get to ask if he was coming to the East Coast?
@HiDLine I think we're all hoping that's TRUE!
@HiDLine wow! That's awesome! I would def make NYC a weekend....I also know more of us could go. I hope he takes it to NYC-or even BOS :-)
@HiDLine yeah...can't jusify $400+ for one night.....
@HiDLine I'd have to fly out Sat AM and then come back Sunday. I'll look up flights when I get home!
@HiDLine what time are you flying out?
@HiDLine what's the last weekend dates? ????
@NKOTBLove_JM @HiDLine and...there's lots to do in NYC so I'd go there
@HiDLine @NKOTBLove_JM I'll go to NYC....the timing of Denver was bad...and it'd be $500 that's NOT going toward Joe.
@JordansFairCHER @blockheadliv @sheluvsboston5 Ohhhhh!  Makes perfect sense!
@JordansFairCHER @blockheadliv @sheluvsboston5 Dumb question. ..what are "wiccies"???
@buckeyeamyjkgrl Gotta for the Pumpkin Spice Latte!!!

@KoryOnTheRadio That's not a lot :)  Have fun at CP!!!!
@KoryOnTheRadio How's the weather over there?  Just hoping it doesn't rain today for the CLE Oktoberfest!!
@TwitJustBecause I have no idea.  I didn't look into that much to see if he was having MnG type things.
Found out today our sales tax went up to 8% when I placed an order online. My county now has the highest tax in the State of Ohio. Nice.
@TwitJustBecause @joeymcintyre I hope so too...CLE really has great theaters he can come to!!  Even Akron!
@TwitJustBecause @joeymcintyre They are loving it! And saying tissues should be part of the tix price!!! LOL I really wish I could go.
Why do I do this to myself? I read my TL, &amp; see all these stories about The Kid @joeymcintyre,@NKOTB...then I get depressed! #missthemmore
@DollG1974 That would be amazing if @joeymcintyre came here. We have plenty of theaters he could perform in :)
@NKOTBLove_JM The girl who Donnie kissed in CBus has gone 5 times &amp; got pics with Joe every time. Tissues should be sold with tix they said!
I'm dying looking at everyone's pics and reading stories. I so badly wanted to go. MAYBE he'll come to CLE :) @NKOTBLove_JM @joeymcintyre
@JoeMacRules tho :-( I would <BLACK HEART SUIT> to be there!
"@JoeMacRules: Thank u rain for holding off until we got here! Night 3 #JoeMacTheKid" I should be there! Can't justify $500 for flight/hotel
