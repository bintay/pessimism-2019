@Optimistic_Gon "Beautiful! HAHAHA! Amazing!"
@Optimistic_Gon He nodded to himself as he watched.
@Optimistic_Gon He tossed you a brush.
@Optimistic_Gon He giggled insanely, painting his skin white. "Yoiu do the lips and hair.
@Optimistic_Gon "Paint his face beautiful if you please. Make him look like us. My present."
@Optimistic_Gon He pointed to the thug.
@Optimistic_Gon "This guy's."
@Optimistic_Gon "Come on, help me paint his face." Joker dropped down a box of paints.
@Optimistic_Gon "I know, right?!"
@Optimistic_Gon "A nicknac you could say!"
@Optimistic_Gon "And I also go it you this. Ha ha!" He dropped a criminal with carved smile on the floor.
@Optimistic_Gon "MY PLEASURE! HAHAHA!"
@Optimistic_Gon A large white pie splashed in your favce and Joker was already on the floor laughing.
@Optimistic_Gon "Open it!"
@Optimistic_Gon "Oh, you're most welcome!'
@Optimistic_Gon "Well, happy birthday, ma boy!" Joker tossed you a present.

@KellyUpton1 Joker, on the hand, who was watching nearby, broke out laughing. "HAHAHA! GET OVER IT KID! HAHAH!"
@DemonFox98 <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@DemonFox98 True, true. But at least it's more "intelligent" you could say.
@MusicalMagics that's a different story. "Oh, it'll be a hot time, in the summer, today! HAHAH!"
@MusicalMagics He was skipping around, humming a toon very loudly, giggling like a maniac every few seconds. Of course he is a maniac, but-
@Killersforfun "Because. You'll get a bullet in your head if you don't. HAHA!"
@DemonFox98 //But they're better than sex rp.
@AnimeLovaha He sped around the street.
@AnimeLovaha "A man with a gun..with two if it's behind him."
@AnimeLovaha "For right now, just look for some /weird/ people. Ha."
@AnimeLovaha "Well, if ya want."
@AnimeLovaha TOWN! HAHAHAHA! I CRACK..I CRACK MYSELF UP! HAHAHAHA!"
@AnimeLovaha "Because /I'm/ gonna protect this trash town of a city!" Joker stops for a moment. "HAHAHAHA!HA!HEE HA! HAHAHAHA!WHOO! TRASH-
@AnimeLovaha "You don't need to come, actually! HAHAH!" He gallops around a street.
@AnimeLovaha Joker immediately jumps up and leaps out the door, pulling out a gun and giggling incoherently.
@AnimeLovaha A few alerts of a break in appeared on the TV.
@AnimeLovaha "You have /great/ patience.." He switched to the news.
@AnimeLovaha "I guess not, no. Heh heh." Joker slouched on a couch and turned on the TV.
@AnimeLovaha "Oh, we won't need that. We just need to get some info."
@AnimeLovaha "Eh, just some stranger's house. HAHAH!"
@AnimeLovaha Joker kicked down the door. "Ah, home sweet home!"
@AnimeLovaha Joker sighed, having nothing to do as he skipped over to a nearby house.
@AnimeLovaha laugh!"
@AnimeLovaha "Oh, Harley, I can't believe you've never heard of the healing power of laughter! Yes, I am a bit /different/, but I still-
@AnimeLovaha "Of course I am! Better than ever! HAHAHAHAHAH!"
@AnimeLovaha "HEE HEE! HA HA HA! HA HO! HA! HA!" Joker rolled on the floor, laughing hysterically.
@AnimeLovaha "There's no other explanation!"
@AnimeLovaha "Oh, just life.." Joker skips around.
@AnimeLovaha His grin tuns into a full laugh.
@AnimeLovaha Joker smirked coldly.
#RPStarters #OpenRP "Aren't I pretty?" Joker held up a picture. 
@AnimeLovaha "A bit of both. HAHA!'
@AnimeLovaha "I don't know. But hey, why should I care?!"
@AnimeLovaha "Yep. And Batsy the Barbarian made me who I am today. And I rejoice to that! HAHA!  See, there's this chemical of some sort..."
@AnimeLovaha "So, I made a few /great/ decisions and went to some chemical plant. Ace, I think it was called."
@AnimeLovaha not."
@AnimeLovaha "Just wait, Harley, just wait. So I'm broke, right? I didn't have nothin'. And my jokes were horrible back then, believe it or-
@AnimeLovaha "Nope! But anyway, I think she was pregnant or somethin'."
@AnimeLovaha "I know, right? And get this! I think I had a wife! HAHAH!"
@AnimeLovaha just a plain lad back in my day.."
@AnimeLovaha "YES, EXACTLY! HAHAHHAHA!" Joker incoherently fixed his tie on his purple suit, and inhaled and exhaled deeply. "Now, I was-
@AnimeLovaha "I do have a theory on why I am /beautiful/! Ha!"
@AnimeLovaha "If you want to put it like that, yes. Ha! So, like I was saying.."
@AnimeLovaha "But before I start, I do hope you recognize me."
@AnimeLovaha "Oh, long story."
@AnimeLovaha "Yes, indeed!" Joker let out another hardy laugh.
@AnimeLovaha Joker recognized this immediately. "You're quite like me!"
@AnimeLovaha "Indeed!'
@AnimeLovaha "So, what's a girl like you doing down here?"
@AnimeLovaha "PERFECT! HAHAHAHAHAH!"
@AnimeLovaha A dark grin formed on his face. "How are you?"
@LostToTheCold Joker then simply looked forward. "Latte please."
@LostToTheCold "BAHAHAH!" Joker laughed hysterically and incoherently skipped around, speeding around.
@LostToTheCold Joker glanced over at you, a dark grin on his face. "Oh, don't mind little ol' me!"
@LostToTheCold Joker raced into the door, laughing hysterically.
@AnimeLovaha "Well, hello there!" The Joker let out a guffaw.
