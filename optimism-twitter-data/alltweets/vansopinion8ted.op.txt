#cdnpoli Will #Harper take part in consortium debates IF they supply him with a closet? #DoItMyWay #ItIsAllAboutMe #HideMeSteve
@gnomeoffender @Norlaine 4 chairs and a closet #CanadianPoliticalSitcom
#cdnpoli Oh how I wish the CPC would send Skippy/Roxie/Paulie to represent #Harper at consortium debates. #mincemeat
@Norlaine Ummm he can suck it up AND find a new job? #cdnpoli
@ugottabekiddin @PnPCBC Agreed and the BS SPIN by CPC has to be called out. Not supporting JT just hate 2 see obvious CPC BS Spin promoted
#cdnpoli #pnpcbc @evansolomoncbc At least @nathancullen has kept the high ground stating JT comment was a gaff lets talk policy. #Class
@dave1oakns @WagleyJWagley @MrDash109 @NGoidie @lpc Well then when the orange wave crushes #CPC &amp; #LPC please don't blame the #NDP #TM4PM
@dave1oakns @WagleyJWagley @MrDash109 @NGoidie @lpc So removing those ads was worth losing thousands of long time members? Is math hard?
#cdnpoli #Harper wants to make #Boycotting #Israel illegal in #Canada YET supports #Israelis calling for #genocide of #Palestinians #BDS
@dave1oakns @WagleyJWagley @MrDash109 @NGoidie @lpc Well does the negativity generated by Trudeau &amp; LPC voting for #C51 help defeat Harper?

#cdnpoli #pnpcbc Stockwell Day All canadians DO know there is danger involved that is why WE question sending CDN troops to fight USA war
@groggyal ?????????????????????????????????????? Did hundreds of millions of Canadians complain of not being able to watch? ????????????????
#cdnpoli IMO it would be smart of party leaders to take part in ALL #debates. Those that don't show up PROVE their fear of facing #Canadians

#cdnpoli #pnpcbc Oh the irony hearing self serving Kory Teneycke saying the consortium is self serving. UMMM Kory SUN NEWS?
#cdnpoli #pnpcbc Is that an ORANGE tie I see Kory wearing. Is he planning on switching sides? crossing the floor?
#cdnpoli #pnpcbc @evansolomoncbc the CPC are DICTATING to Canadians what they will do. Let Harper miss the consortium &amp; show his fear
#cdnpoli #pnpcbc Torty is PO'ed because he lost his Sun News job. I guess this is why Harper hired him. Fear is their leader
@poli_nerd @PierrePoilievre Yes it also says U of Calgary experts (not pro CPC?) and "some economists" like Harper is SOME economist!
@SenateSeat_4Liz cpac.ca
#cdnpoli LMAO as @PierrePoilievre laugh at LPC budget forgetting CPC started with a $13B surplus they turned into a $160B DEBT. #MathIsHard
#cdnpoli WOO HOO a column that speaks respectfully of @PierrePoilievre for a change. OH wait written by John Ivison no bias there eh? #FAIL

#cdnpoli So sickening to see @MPRandyHoback purposely FORGET to finish statement. HELPING THE POOR IS WHATS FAIR. Say goodbye @ #elxn42.
#cdnpoli SAD to see people like @MPRandyHoback repeat only half a sentence as facts! LYING to Canadians will not get the CPC re elected. BYE
#cdnpoli Well then @KellieLeitch I really hope you WARNED them about any building anywhere near Lake HURON where YOU lobby for NUCLEAR WASTE
#cdnpoli Really? @EdHolder_MP Why? So that if they R not doing OIL supported research your CPC party can muzzle them? More CPC double speak?
@HopeAldridge @Urban_Su @ThomasMulcair @pmharper The more debates the merrier. Real leaders should do all debates. Let SH miss consortium 1s
@canadianglen Another one upset that Sun News failed so miserably. I wonder if Stevie wants his buddy Ezra as moderator as well?

@gmbutts @MuskokaMoneybag Is he upset that SUN NEWS is not around to have a skewed debate?
@WeLikeTom @montrealsimon Ok I can live with that. Good points

@WeLikeTom Just remember you are carrying the NDP tag with you. Sanity &amp; civility stays paramount! Carry on! lol
@WeLikeTom ok well have fun. I spent hours trying &amp; eventually blocked. In occupy movement I used to bat them around like a cat does a mouse
@WeLikeTom  calgary kia guy is a troll. do not waste your time on Ed Tanas. Not worth the investment in time.
#cdnpoli Jim Prentice had 1 phrase I believe all CPCLITE/LPC supporters should hear. Lost #elxn41 LOOK IN THE MIRROR! Stop blaming others!
@Love_maplesyrup @answerallman @trapdinawrpool TY it was kinda thrown together after being told how wrong I was for supporting NDP &amp; GPC
@Love_maplesyrup 1 of the things I saw often @ the #Occupy camps. Strangers talking to each other about politics. Talking not ponrtificating
@janfromthebruce @P_Wog And that my friends is the difference between NDP and CPCLITE run by Justin Trudeau. One will repeal the other amend
#cdnpoli 211 remember the number 211 that is the number of seats the #NDP took second or first place in #elxn41 We'll improve that 4 #elxn42
@Love_maplesyrup On brighter note I was on public transit a week ago &amp; heard four people talking politics. That wouldn't of happened in 2004
@Love_maplesyrup Yes I am more then willing to debate issues with most anyone but start getting frustrated when I get tired same old stories
Yuuup
Absolutely correct

@trapdinawrpool @Love_maplesyrup
@answerallman @trapdinawrpool @Love_maplesyrup Fed Up of being told who will win #elxn42? 
@Love_maplesyrup @trapdinawrpool Twitter, Fascebook you should hear some of the stories I get &amp; names I'm called for pointing out the idiocy
@trapdinawrpool @Love_maplesyrup They are so stuck blaming NDP for their loss in 2011. NO comprehension that it was LPC voters that switched
damage control mode.  Trudeau's betrayal of Canada is the 
real issue! Dema…
@Love_maplesyrup @trapdinawrpool yet still we hear the ABC2015 crowd cooing for the CPCLITE LPC claiming only LPC can defeat CPC.
@JKennethY @kevinrns @gilmcgowan @Urban_Su @RobertFife No wondering we all know Mr Fife is an LPC supporter as for Alberta,  any 1 but NDP.
