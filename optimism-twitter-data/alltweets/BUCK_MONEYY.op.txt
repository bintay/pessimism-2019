Graphic tees?? How are those professional? Jeans? Those are hardly ever seen in the professional world
Shoulders? You see those all the time

I WAS TRYING TO GO TO BED BEFORE 8:30 NOW IT IS ALMOST 11 AND IM STILL PLAYING CANDY CRUSH
~~~~~ good night 
@whoaaitsciera good!! I dont think anyone should give up idk its just my opinion that the RIP sounds like there's no hope of him being found
@pheobe_ploof it's just sad to see people not being hopeful or optimistic that he's still out there even if there is a slight chance of it
@pheobe_ploof feeding in as in going along with rumors, clearly everyone (even if they didnt know him) wants to pay their respect but //
@whoaaitsciera yesssssss i would 1000000% but if this was you missing wouldnt you feel awful hearing people give up on you idk
@alayahshea and when people are saying all the RIP stuff it's like saying they're giving up hope....
@alayahshea i don't but i've been checking the news every 15 minutes and they're still looking for him he's not considered dead //
@The1mariam i love u
@pheobe_ploof i get that but wishing someone to rest in peace when there's a possibility they're still alive is awful
@pheobe_ploof excuse me lol
I hope u all know this is a joke and i try very hard in school
Got 3 tests tomorrow boutto flip a desk and walk out of all my classes #JustWaitOnIt
@jawaun_johnson7 @briana_reyrey yeee trust no one
@briana_reyrey THANK U
@maddyxrose it was to prepare for it i guess 
Tbh he probably is but nothing is certain
@CELusk05 theyre still looking as of 2 hours ago idk
@jawaun_johnson7 no hes not people are just making up rumors and assuming things but theyre still looking for him hes not confirmed dead
I've never spoken a word to this kid ever but if people were going around saying i was dead if i was actually just missing i'd be livid
EVERY single picture or post i've seen about Karl telling him to rest in piece i've commented on telling people to stop
EVERY SINGLE ONE
@EmilyWinakor98 15* and you said you were okay with that!! We had a deal!!!!!
@EmilyWinakor98 wtf you cant just say you're gonna let me buy your ticket and then give it away to someone else you knew i wanted it
Stop saying Karl is dead people are still looking for him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing is confirmed!!!!!!!!!!!!! He could still be out there!!!!!!
1) We have 8 minutes till practice starts
2) It'll take almost an hour to get there
3) We are just pulling out of the driveway now
@EmilyWinakor98 ME
@EmilyWinakor98 aren't they still looking for him though?

In my defense that picture of the bikini came after a rant about how unnecessary and overpriced they are
Like a range rover or pure bread puppy or maison des fleurs or bath bombs or a triangl bikini or a $600 worth of designer makeup
STOP
All i ever see on twitter anymore are obnoxious white girl accounts w the caption "want <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>" or "need this <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>" with pics of unrealistic things
