My anxiety is through the roof right now. Omg. #NYXFACEAWARDS
@xSimplyyMarilyn Congratulationss!! I loveeddd your video! Definitely one of the coolest entries. :)
@KarmaCassie Congratulations!!! :)
@Mojo_Mely Haha you're fine!! It's been a VERY intense weekend on that hashtag. No one knows what's going on!!
@Mojo_Mely There's just a very excited/nervous group on here, currently! It happens! :P
Just got way too excited seeing "Nyx Cosmetics" show up in my e-mail....but it was just their newsletter. Anyone else?? #NYXFACEAWARDS
Me, currently. 
I've been looking for these brushes for two weeks....in the exact drawer I've been looking for them. 
@satans_hellpopx Yeeeessssssss. And dress shopping! And just life things in generallll!
@DeBaKai No, I don't know it.
I see the people at NYX sitting around a table giggling over everyone tweeting...enjoying some coffee and doughnuts. #NYXFACEAWARDS
@satans_hellpopx Sttoooopppp. You're going to make me cry because I miss you so much &lt;/3
I'm 23 and I feel like I've done absolutely nothing with my life. I pretty much hate it.
@AddictToMakeup I haven't seen anything yet! D:
This has been my life all weekend. 8 ball, don't let me down. #NYXFACEAWARDS 
I mean....I guess she got her use out of it since she got 4 years out of it....but this doesn't help when only she can afford a new phone :|
Annnnddddd of course my mom's phone would die now. <NEUTRAL FACE>
Just need some sort of proof that things are going to change.
@_classylikethat Same here!!
I mean...in all fairness the NYX offices are closed on the weekends. We'll probably hear tomorrow #NYXFACEAWARDS
@satans_hellpopx #muyspanglish #yohablounpoquito #isthatright #idfk
@satans_hellpopx Roflmaooo and that's exactly how "Saladvariety" was born hahaha. #notspanish #badatit
@satans_hellpopx ROFLMAO you can also call me "Caitlyn Saladvariety." That is also highly appropriate since that's also another go-to
@satans_hellpopx cuz i will be "caitlyn salalala"
@satans_hellpopx He's why I changed my Twitter handle lol
@satans_hellpopx BLAME CHRIS! lol
@satans_hellpopx LMFAOOO
@satans_hellpopx WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
@AddictToMakeup fooor reall. could they factor in the people who are super anxious about the competition orrr-? lol
@AddictToMakeup No you're not!! That's totally something I would do if I had some soap. I usually tear up paper when I'm nervous or anxious!
@AddictToMakeup That's actually pretty awesome haha. Any specific shape you're carving out?
This wait for the #NYXFACEAWARDS is beyonddd the worst thing ever. I hate not knowing!
Forever asking Lori the real questions in life.
@MercadezCecilia worst. Wait. Ever!!
@AddictToMakeup I feel like that could be it too. Which stinks. Lol someone slip up!! :P
@AddictToMakeup Hoping today! This wait is nerve wracking and I hate not seeing anything on here saying they were called for it.
I can mostly see my floor. And it's scary.
Like....I don't even know what I'm doing with myself today. #confused #haveplans #butalsodont #what
Oh, cool. I love when my keyboard decides to stop working on my MacBook. It's what dreams are made of.
@DeBaKai like whyyy
@DeBaKai Well, that's annoying.
@DeBaKai did the guy show up yet?
I haven't been this anxious over something in such a long time. I know I'm not going to make it in this competition....but still.
I just want to go back to bed. :(
Me cooking will always be dangerous. :X
Today's the last day. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Only a matter of time before you wind up like that junkie you thought was better than me. #calledit <OK HAND SIGN>üèª<OK HAND SIGN>üèª<OK HAND SIGN>üèª
Nothing like putting two things together and having it all make sense. Can't even feel sorry because it was always your fault anyway

Gained 7 new followers in the past week. I‚Äôm growing my account the right way, are you? Do it with 
I'm late. But yet somehow I'm still here first. #holleratme
Lady in the white ford. That's not how that works but ok.
The amount of traffic there is is unreal.
Already looking forward to 1 so I can go back to bed. :(
I'm baffled by this....if you're getting your normal coffee but with ice in it instead...it's literally no more calories than normal.....
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts Yes, absolutely! Super excited! :) #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts Awhh! Time went so fast! #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts As soon as I get to try the products, absolutely! :) #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts What can we do?? :) #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts I would love to! I'll look tonight when I'm out! :) #ChooseFriendly
@helloproducts I've actually been trying to bring up the coupon, but it doesn't load for me! This is what I get. :( 
Twitter parties are difficult. Omg they move so fast.
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts Agreed!! #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts Absolutely love this fact! Too many things are over processed with junk anymore! #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts Totally jealous of everyone enjoying their products! Sounds like the products are amazing!! #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts I didn't get to try any, but I would love to try Mint Mojito and the Peach Mango! #ChooseFriendly
@InfluensterVox No, I didn't receive any @helloproducts :( Was really hoping for that box, too! Products look awesome! #ChooseFriendly
I swear, if they actually take Wishes out of the Magic Kingdom before I get to go again....I'm going to be one very sad girl.
@Wawa Pennsylavania
@InfluensterVox @helloproducts Doing great today! How about you? :)#ChooseFriendly
Oh, you can use our music for any of your videos! BUT ALLOW ME TO CLAIM YOUR VIDEO AS MY OWN FOR USING IT. #wtf #neveragain
And even better - then doesn't even give the information I needed/wanted. #ok
I love love LOVE vendors that get back to you....almost two months later.
They were published already....so why are the dates weird?
Interesting fact - even though my videos have been uploaded for the past few days, it shows the publish date as today. That's wrong.
Caitlyn Storm just ordered a free sample box from PINCHme! 
@DeBaKai I'll message you it. #subtweeting
Just read the most #firstworldproblem status on Facebook ever...and I don't think I've ever been more annoyed.
It's waaaay too early, but this is too cute. #help 
my entry into the nyx face awards!

@DeBaKai :(
@DeBaKai blaaaahhhhhh
@DeBaKai #sigh :/
Sometimes I feel like people have this picture painted of me that I can't live up to or it's completely wrong. I never know what to think.
Had a dream that I was at a @WeTheKings show and I got all the guys to sign the back of my phone and it was all so beautiful. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
May the 4th be with you! :)
I will forever want my nose pierced. Why does everyone tell me not to do it?
Mistakes by Breathe Carolina just makes my night sometimes. I don't know what it is about that song.
TRUTH. 
@buckhollywood omg this struggle is veryyyy real!! #youtubelife
Really not enjoying the ever so slow trickling of my increasing anxiety....
I would love to know how in the hell I managed to lose makeup brushes...in a case no less. #wtf #whereareyou


Have you checked out my entry for the @NyxCosmetics Face Awards, yet?
Sometimes my dog makes me really not want kids. At all.
Soooo glad my dog just decided to throw up on me. I didn't just take a shower or wash these clothes or anything.
That was the fastest $90 to ever go. This being an adult thing really isn't all it's cracked up to be. At all.
I'm just trying to be an adult and pay bills but nothing seems to want to work. Ok.
Is there any particular reason the Internet is basically broken today-?
I hate how I always told myself I would never let myself become "that girl" but yet I became her twice.
This is one memory lane I would like to get off now, thanks.
Wow. This perfume from Ipsy would be great....if it didn't smell exactly like the cologne my one ex used to wear. That's fun.
maybe i should genuinely go through and actually start throwing things out....eventually.
Omfg. Firefox refuses to close out any tabs. Why.
Congrats on 6 years of vlogs @CharlesTrippy !! Been watching since day 154! Super excited to see how year 7 goes. :)
"Oh yeah, we'll post your payment the same day if you do it before 5." But yet you never do.... #liars
lol wtf is sleep
i just dont know anymore.....
i'm never going to be good enough.
Have you checked out my new video? It's my first makeup tutorial! Make sure you give it a thumbs up!!‚Ä¶ 
I wanna be a mermaid ~
How am I still awake??
@EdgarAllanBr0 that is seriously the best part of driving...having your own dance parties and karaoke sessions. #truth
The sky's awake so I'm awake 
Finally ready for bed....hours later.
#life #why
I'm just over it.
Am I not allowed to be a person orrrr-?
I just really don't care anymore.
@DeBaKai lmfao you might have given me the desire to hustle...BUT need to focus in terms of the future first and work from there.
@DeBaKai We knew it was coming lol. :P And cool, cool. Hopefully we can actually get some things knocked out!
@DeBaKai Skype tonight? Possibly? If we don't pass out?
@DeBaKai I think we might need a calendar to be involved, as well, sir. We've got a ton of important events to get planned.
My YouTube manager and I need to discuss upcoming events and get that stuff planned. #veryimportant
So don't love the depression that comes with the weekend being over and not being with Chris...is it time to move out yet-?
Absolutely adore the amount of ridiculously heavy breathing I have to do in order to try and breathe. Not feeling it at all.
It has a lot of turtles!
Can't wait for Christopher to get back! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
worst. internet. ever.
Well, hi there strange dude who just decided to pull up onto the curb at Target. How you doing?
There's like....not enough time to do anything today. I don't like it.
I know my weekend starts after 5:30 today, but honestly I can't wait for tomorrow.
I'm hungry. :(
Uhm.

I mean.... wallets are great, too.

I'm absolutely ok with dropping $300 on a bag. #noshame #futurereference


I really would just like a kate spade bag.
And this is why I genuinely want her as my wedding photographer. She is the sweetest person ever. 
Like literally I'm just par for the course of my past coming back to haunt me. This time we went back to my sophomore year of hs.
I feel like everything in my life currently is designed to work against me.
Ha. Hahahaha. Hahahahaha so over everything.
Enjoyed my mom pointing out my ever increasing dark circles. #whatissleep #foreverstressed #idontknow #igiveup
Clearly not sleeping anytime soon...
I give up.
@mrscook lol I used to sell the bracelets legit. XD
Well. Wasn't expecting the sudden feels.
I'm very intrigued by the Great Adventure safari bus at the Freehold Mall.
@spikedudej it was something about how certain "fruits" were calling to you more than others. But you didn't know which fruit to pick.
Normally it takes me forever to finish using a product, but I already finished up my eyebrow pencil. T.T
I never knew that speaking about fruits could be so deep. #whoa @spikedudej  
Only I could pull off going to work earlier than I need to without realizing. #weirdhours #oops
What's up headache from hell
I'm 99.9% sure the only friend I have is Chris at this point.
Can I just sleep oorrrrr do you have to insist on still talking to me?
Having one of those nights where I can't sleep.
Not a fan of not waking up next to Christopher.... :(
Freeeeeeeeedom
why am i so exhausted still
April 19th - the day/night things got really interesting. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Soooo beyond exhausted. I need tomorrow.
One of these days I‚Äôll be more active on here! Something besides just the automatic posting of my videos. #letstalk
Snuggle time? Snuggle time. #please
I really just want to watch the Digimon movie. But no one has it. #why
Honestly I just really want to be curled up next to Chris watching a movie.
I was great....until my knee decided to have a moment.
@DeBaKai How should I get myself dinner when I get out tonight?
Sometimes coming to work isn't too bad... Just need to remember to pay it forward next time. 
One step forward two steps back. Seems like that's how it'll always be for me.
I just don't want to care.
Ooowwwwwww. :(
Omg. I can't use the 3d on my 3ds because it makes my eye twitch. #nomegusta
Thought our dentist appointments were at 1 and 2....apparently it's 12 and 1? #how #when #why
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. :(
Omg. The pain I'm in right now.... :(
Cuz I suck and get caught up - 
but i want to go to philly to see a movie with @Jessewelle and @PhillyChic5 tomorrow :( (or later today, rather...)
And my night still isn't over. T.T
Maybe one of these days I'll be normal....
I mean....maybe one of these days I won't have weird dreams...
I'm bothered by the girls I went to school with who refuse to branch out from Mac makeup. You're missing out on a whole world of cosmetics!!
@MsKailynMarie - I've been watching your videos for a long time! Don't let people bother you so much. They have nothing better to do.
I just really want to sleep in until 7 and snuggle. #dontfeelgood
Nothing like stumbling upon video from my first @WeTheKings concert. Met some absolutely amazing people that day. &lt;3
Aaaaandddd I want them both.  
Oh. The contractor my ex used to "work" for. And by work I mean he complained the whole time. #witness #ohok #thisisweird
I get no greater joy than when random people come over and block my car in. #whoareyou
I'm not a fan of these weird dreams I've been having. :(
:(
I would like it if my husband didn't stop talking to me in the middle of a conversation after informing me he was tired and was driving.
@DeBaKai &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@DeBaKai thank youu &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I hope they have some in store. :( It's not terrible for shipping if I have to buy online, so idk.
@debakai - favor tonight??? #please 
@DeBaKai Well, shit. Wasn't expecting the feels so early in the morning. #damnit #iloveyou
@DeBaKai what are the other things? lol #videogames #food #sleep ;P
Like that's all I want to do. Just snuggle with Christopher. That's the only thing that makes me happy.
If I could just snuggle with my husband that would be wonderful.
hi, my name is caitlyn and i'm addicted to videogames and makeup.
The smell of these cookies is amazingggg
Teenage girls are weird.... I'm so glad I was more into staying home and playing video games.
Oowwwwww. :(
Can I maybe not be sick? Thanks?
Also cold and kinda sick. But current game of choice is Fantasy Life 
I forgot how long it takes when you legitimately edit things. An hour and a half for my highlights video, half an hour for my vlog. #omg
75 clips worth of video from yesterday....why.
I have no desire to ever join a YouTube network...unless it's a really good one. And doesn't suck.
How many times does the same drink need to be remade? And STILL not be right? Disappointed by @Starbucks again. :(
Almost died on a bench. Ok.
Just tried using my house key to get into my car....
@DeBaKai #yes
@DeBaKai #cantwait
@DeBaKai #goodthingsahead
@DeBaKai I know you said it wasn't good. I wish we had a Wii U because Tropical Freeze is on the list. :(
Mario Party or Yoshi's New Island for my elite gift for Club Nintendo? #decisions #help #alreadyhaveothergames
I've told my mom the same thing like...5 times. Omg.
@DeBaKai Ooh....true.
@DeBaKai i'm sooorrryyyy lol
@DeBaKai Otaaayyyy
@DeBaKai call nintendo and ask if they can remove the transfer block!
Only plus side to constantly dropping my Macbook (twice in three days) is the amount of crap that gets dislodged from under the keyboard
Just saw @ijustine in a Nintendo New 3DS XL commercial...Should've just been all her in it!
No Chili's. I don't need you to send me coupons.
Yes, mom. I'm well aware I need to get rid of stuff. #waiting
#forevertired #backtobed
I just really want to wake up next to Chris every day. :(
Christopher and I just learned how to waltz. What did you do tonight? :P
When you look at it, the MMN3DS is just black with faceplates. 
@DeBaKai ....holy shit.
@DeBaKai how many?
@DeBaKai :( :( :( :(
@DeBaKai :(
@DeBaKai :/
Tired af.
Just realized how much people have commented on the lovely bags under my eyes this past week. :| #tired #stressed #overit
@DeBaKai Just woke up completely over everything.
Having another day where I'm just more than ready to peace out of Jersey. <VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è<VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è<VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
omfg i'm laughing so hard.
Giggling while watching the vlog where I fell into a ton of bushes.... That was a bad day.
@DeBaKai :) 
@DeBaKai UGH
@DeBaKai nothing special!
@DeBaKai whaaatttttt
@DeBaKai I WAS JUST ON YOUTUBE lol
@DeBaKai I don‚Äôt know!!
I didn't think it was possible to get blocked from using Google....buuuuttttt apparently you can?
I forgot to do surveys on club nintendo <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>


VIDEOOO
I like how my mom all of a sudden mentions she wants to move to Bradenton, Fl #random
Omg editing this is taking forevveeerrrrrr. T.T
@DeBaKai Oh shitt. They're going to be at the PNC. D: Guess we're going lol
edit edit edit edit edit.
Today is the day!!!
I would appreciate it if my neighbors dog wasn't essentially screaming at this time.
Facebook....if you could just....maybe stop changing every other week that would be great.
@DeBaKai Did I not just tweet that? Lol
In the Starbucks line from hell. #why #stopit
Excuse me. There's 900 other open spots and you picked the one next to me why?
I think I'm officially past that breaking point...
I really have no desire to go to work. I just want to sleep....
I've just given up completely.
K....
I wonder how long it would take to upload a decent chunk of these old photos to Facebook. There's some good ones.
Ok...officially over this maracuja oil. I can't deal with the smell anymore. #needstogoback
I want to use my Pumpkin Spice candle....but I also want to use my Clean Cotton reed diffuser.... #help
I currently have more deodorant swipes by @WhishBeauty than I know what to do with! I love it!
Filming haul videos is weird.
Oh god. Only I would manage to spray sea salt spray into my mouth. Omfg. It tastes terrible. #notsmart
@DeBaKai mehh
@DeBaKai #sigh
@DeBaKai nope
@DeBaKai noppeeee
@DeBaKai wwoooowwww lol
@DeBaKai but stillll
@DeBaKai omfg.
@DeBaKai why the hell were you up so late? Omg.
I legitimately don't understand how people younger than me can have kids. Like...you don't even have your shit together. Stop it.
I haven't had a dream like that in a long time. :(
I'm also amazed at how many people don't understand what shampoo/conditioner is....but use it. This review I'm watching is painful.
I can't stand girls who fill in their eyebrows....but then keep continuing on so they're almost at unibrow status. It looks stupid. #stopit
I'm tired and exhausted and I should still be sleeping, but my asshole phone woke me up...to inform me I'm broke. #thanks
How the hell do companies expect someone to live off of $200 for two weeks? Really? And next pay check will be even less? #great
Why am I all of a sudden approachable to people. Go away.
Can't figure out which eye shadow palette is my favorite....and I WANT MORE. #help #addiction
Maracuja oil smells absolutely terrible...but it does magical things to my skin.
I hate going outside and not seeing my cat...
I'm not functioning correctly today. At all.
@DeBaKai of course not. :P
@DeBaKai Halp lol
@DeBaKai which means I need to be worried later on. ;P
@DeBaKai that's dangerous lmfao
@DeBaKai This....this is true. Because I definitely would've been annoying. Or creepy about it. Or both! lol #uptooearly #waytooawake
Downside to waking up early when I'm not with Chris - not being able to wake him up when I'm bored. ;P
omg it's funny to see kids younger than me wearing the exact same band shirts I used to wear when I was between 13-16. #imold
The more I think about it, the more I realize I've completely outgrown this state.
@Wawa Turkey and cheese!! #wawaclassicsweeps
I had a loooottttt of purple going on. Omg.  
I wish I could accurately describe what I ate as other than air. Like. What
I just really want a burger right now. Or wings. Haven't had wings in a long time.
@PhillyD I've had you on my friends list for forever. Can we make it happen? 
I think it's a little special that our neighbors have no problems coming into our backyard to trap our pets.
@DeBaKai Oh god. Mickey hugs <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è (and obviously)
@DeBaKai any other state would be good, to. Florida's just nice for the proximity of my happy place.
Pretty sure that I could break something with how hard these bu√±uelos are. :( Like...I could throw one at someone's head and knock them out.
I just want to live my life the way that I've wanted and stop having to live for other people and work dead end jobs. And I want my cat....
I just really, really, really, really want out of this state. I want out of this town. I want to do what I want to for once.
I honestly hate my neighbors more than anything....I fucking swear if they kill my cat........
Excuse me, but why are my stuffed animals all in a bag? How about no?
Chris - "know what we should do?" Then just doesn't say what we should do....ok.
Day drinking with the husband <TROPICAL DRINK><CLINKING BEER MUGS><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
I think now is the time for me to try and pursue a career on YouTube more than ever.
I want the rest of my cheesecake now. :(
I'm liking that today is sooooo much more relaxed than yesterday. #finally
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
Helpppp.
And then some random dude asked me out? No? Like excuse me?
First I run into a kid I went to high school and graduated with who I haven't seen in 5 years....
Omg. I'm dieing. I can't with today.
@DeBaKai I've been hopping to it since 8! &gt;:(
I have just over an hour to finish getting ready. T.T and there's soooo much to do.
@DeBaKai <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
When I want time to go fast, it goes slow....but then I want it to go slow and it's going fast. #no
@DeBaKai I am....but not old enough for that. ;P
@DeBaKai How many times have I told you noootttt to call me ma'am? :( I'M NOT THAT OLD.
@DeBaKai lol THEN HOP TO IT!!
@DeBaKai it's my job to be a pain in the ass ;P shhhhh
@DeBaKai Guarantee I get to be like....15 minutes away from your house and you won't be! lol
@DeBaKai oh....omg. You're so not going to be ready by 1:30 lol
@DeBaKai what do you still need to do?
@DeBaKai ;) Love youu
@DeBaKai #knewyouwould #itwassleepytime
Well that was rough. But ok.
It's killing me that I STILL can't put stuff on my face cuz of the reaction I had to my makeup. T.T Clear up, damn it!
@spikedudej @KaiserCoaster Like in all actuality nothing can be said because I still have the other account. And I use it.
@spikedudej @KaiserCoaster Still have the other one, so I don't want to hear it!
Giggling at the conversation Chris and I were having a year ago today. Oooh wow.
@mrscook Hahaha surpriseee! It was a long time coming, though. I needed the change...anything besides that purple.
@mrscook Thank you!! I keep trying to get a decent photo with it but I can't get one I like so no one even knows I changed it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@spikedudej @caitography it's cool. Love you too
@spikedudej correction - the other one still exists. @caitography HOW U LIKE ME NOW
@KaiserCoaster my name lol
It's soooo nice out....and all I'm doing is laundry. #sad
@DeBaKai that's even worse.....lol
@DeBaKai you're in a mood....lol why
@DeBaKai no you!!
@DeBaKai no! You're wronnngggggggg lol
@DeBaKai could we maybe stop syncing up, thank you? Lol
@DeBaKai you and me both lolololol
My name is Caitlyn and sometimes waiting last minute to think of things is the best idea EVER.
I knew purchasing all of that wrapping paper at Christmas would prove useful at one point. Moderately obsessed with the paper I just used.
I hate writing something so much that it looks weird....I'm at the point where I feel like I'm spelling Christopher's name wrong. x.x
"I made an origami bat. But I needed two pieces of paper because it didn't overlap right."
Dude, you know you had that place researched well in advance. You don't think that's the name - you know it's the name.
"I think there's a horror themed restaurant in New York. I don't know if I would go in it though. I think it's called Jekyll and Hyde."
"there's a dinosaur themed restaurant called dinosaur or something....like rainforest cafe."
"We should go through a travel agent so we can go to downtown Disney together."
"I just want to go to downtown Disney"
"I have a tshirt made of a dollar."
Why did I not live tweet this conversation?
First impressions of my Dessange VoxBox - absolutely adore the smell of the shampoo and conditioner! Smells delicious! :) #JadoreDessange
The best things in life are free from @Influenster! #JadoreDessange
Every time I see photos from the #DefrancoWedding, I absolutely adore how excited @PhillyD and @LinzDeFranco look. You two are perfect.
Met a customer yesterday who was planning basically my dream DIY wedding. #jealous #want
I've been waaaayyy behind on Apple news. Finally more information on the Apple watch! #needinmylife
but why are plantain chips so damn good?
MOTHER SHUT THE DOOR WHEN YOU LEAVE MY ROOM OMG.
It's interesting watching my poodle rub her face on the floor. #weirdo
Welp....guess I'm up for today. #wanttosleepmore
Honestly Christopher is the most incredible person I know.
Christopher's giggles make me happy. :3
Bored and reading random complaints people have...someone wants a full refund on a product over a year old. Uhm-? #nothowthatworks
19 Reasons Brunch Weddings Are Pretty Much Perfect 
@DeBaKai No. You don't need to walk.
It's too eaaarrrlyyyyyy. Way too tired rn. #needcoffee #help
Just got home and I have to wake up early for work. <WEARY FACE> #ldrproblems
@Bones00 I'm still maintaining hope there's some somewhere.
@Bones00 Yesterday. GameStop released a new bundle yesterday.
@DeBaKai are we still doing tonight?
Pretty sure my anxiety just spiked through the roof just now..... :(
Oh. Ok. Only have 10 minutes to get to work. :|
Thanks for....the....$5 mom? lol
I just want to snuggle all day.
Really need to take some long exposure photos in New Brunswick this spring/summer. Love photos of all the cars going by.
Like subscription boxes and wear makeup? Check out Ipsy! :) 
Rocking the white nails because why not.
Can I use the Force to get my phone from across the room? Not like it matters because no one wants to talk to me anyway.
Just got excited thinking I finally had a reply back.....not even remotely close to being right.
My homes? #howdoitype #5hourslater
Welp, my homes for that MMN3DS console were dashed in a span of 5 seconds.
@LinzDeFranco omg you two are cute as anything. &lt;3 Looks almost like a before prom/homecoming photo, too. ;P &lt;3 &lt;3
Can I watch markipliers fnaf videos orrrrr-?
Hi.
Be jealous. I just entered to #WinAWedding! 
The struggle is real.
My room is basically clean. And now I'm bored because I don't know what to do with myself.
Just noticed my one friend is friends with the twin brother of the twin I'm friends with. Does that even make sense? #smallworld
I'm always more productive when it snows. #why
Twitter, you get my face today. Deal with it. 
The fact I can *kinda* see my closet is scary. Working from the top down.
Just said I was deleting things instead of throwing them out. #oh
I mean....I guess I can clean.
PSA - Your website is too big if it scrolls sideways.
I mean, I'm glad it waited until now to start...but after 10 minutes and my car is covered? Yeah, no.
It's snowing sideways. Excuse me, but stores shouldn't be open today....but apparently they are. #logic #nobodycares
Uhm-? 
My name is Caitlyn and I talk to myself too much.
Some kid is pretending to be a dolphin? I mean....I don't even know.
My functionality as a human is forever at 0
I mean it's ok. I didn't need space to get out of my car or anything.
Well that only took a whole 10 minutes longer. #lame
Why do companies have to be fragrance in things that go on your face? I'll deal with the nasty smell so my face doesn't break out. :(
#DearMe 
I've deleted the same set of emails 5 times....but they aren't going away. #why
Maybe I should finally remove all of the photos on my phone...since I have photos from the beginning of the year taking up space. :X
Didn't think that an ugly town by me could look so nice. Proud of them for going into LBI for getting a few of those shots. #dancemoms
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ALDC WAS IN THE TOWN 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM ME? Not to mention the name was said wrong... #ow #jerseyreppin
I thought I would hate the new walkways, but they look really nice. Can't wait for whenever I get there!! - 
Wtf did they do to Instagram?
If I could just own one of everything by @NyxCosmetics I would be an extremely happy person. #please
Just spent way too much time reading Five Nights at Freddy's theories. This fanbase is insane.
I'm scared. I'm being productive.
I've been up since 5. Help.
Why do people have to turn things into a competition that don't even need to be?
@melissy2107 I think I might! I want to make the move out there
@melissy2107 omg I just saw this. I had to miss out on my phone interview because they couldn't reschedule it. So technically it WAS yes lol
I don't want to go to work. :(
Panda Express just seems really good right now....except the closest one to me is 40 or so miles away. #ok
Watch my viddeeeeyaaaaa - 
For the first time in the years that I've owned my MacBook....it's finally decided to read my memory card. I'm scared. The world is ending.
#1 reason I hate opening - waking up early since I get this ridiculous coughing fit every morning. #funtimes
I'm so over this dress thing. Omfg.
Black and blue. Problem solved. #thedress 
I totally like this new name better hahaha
@DeBaKai Hahahahahahahaha. I can't.
@YouTuberShouts ULTA BEAUTY MAKEUP HAUL! 
@DeBaKai #fouryearlongjoke #holycrap
@DeBaKai So...now this just means we have to look even more. D: #fml
@debakai Holy shit. Look. MORE. ARE. COMING. #mm3dswatch 
It's snowing, I feel like hell, and I'm not amused by life today.
@DeBaKai I still need to get pokemon bank.... &lt;_&lt;
I filmed a haul video!


If I could just sit and binge watch The @MindyProjectFOX I would be ok. Can someone get me the dvd's orrrr-?
I'm cold and hot all at once, I'm tired, I don't feel good and I want to snuggle. :( #sad
Why am I listening to the spanish version of "wasn't me""?" Im confused. Especially by the Mario sound effects
Tiny humans can be cute sometimes.
I want to try on wedding dresses <DRESS><RING><BRIDE WITH VEIL>
I love having Christopher as my wallpaper on my computer so I can look at his handsome face the whole time <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Mother. Can you stop going through my stuff? Thanks.
I just really want to meet Baymax, ok.
Omg why is Baymax the cutest thing ever.
Alright well that wasn't as bad as I remember. On to step three. <OK HAND SIGN>
Wait. There's a fourth section now????
Since when is there a third section?!?! Maybe I don't remember it?! Omg
I forgot how long and tedious this process is. Omg.
I seriously can't believe I'm putting myself through this process all over again. #crazy
I'm so glad that people at Starbucks are really shitty and judge people playing games. #yourethelosers
Oh today is just turning out to be the best day ever. #sarcasm
I'm just completely done. I've never wanted to just run away more than now.
Clearly I'm just the best at not doing anything right anymore.
@WDW_Crane magical doesn't begin to describe you!!
@DeBaKai sooo I would kinda like to see you today still? Let me know? I guess message me but I won't see it until 3.
for like....5 minutes i would just like to not be sad. that would be great.
<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Can't sleep. :/
I mean, I wouldn't be opposed to knowing what's going on tomorrow or anything.
Pretty sure I'm done cleaning for the night. At least I *mostly* have a floor.
answer - in a stupid spot as usual.
Currently having a moment of "where the hell did I put that?"
.@tacobell seems wonderful right now.
I've had the damn batteries in this mouse since I think November...this is uncalled for. 
#favoritepasttime - talking to air. Loveee the nights no one talks to me.
no really. i'm bored.
But @tyleroakley ...wat. R u ok? 
Still genuinely annoyed that the nail polish I wanted got taken completely out of the system and had to be thrown out. #suchawaste #wantedit
Played the sims for literally 5 minutes. Now what.
The fact there's a twitter for the @WDW_Crane just made my day. I miss seeing that magical creature every day. #fantasylandpet #love
K, well, I added another 12X12 square of floor that can now be seen. That's progress, right?
Seriously, at some point in my life I will own a vanity. It will be pretty. And it will be perfect. And I'll be organized af.
I guess now would be a good time to actually finish cleaning. #1monthlater
I need more flowers in my life.
Going to bed because honestly wtf is the point.
@DeBaKai BTW literally anything can be better than what I was dealing with sssooooooo
@DeBaKai Uhm?
Baymax makes a really good pillow 
I would absolutely adore not feeling like absolute hell right now.
Well, that was a pathetic paycheck.
Honestly, in this day and age I don't understand full 40-hour week unpaid internships. Like...you can't survive on that at all, but ok.
Had a dream last night that I was literally best friends with @shaycarl . Like....I hung out at his house and everything. #prettycool
Might as well go back to bed now that my dreams were shot down. Damn it, Nintendo. I hate your limited edition stuff anymore.
3 hours until the sims finishes downloading. Ugh.
bored bored bored bored bored bored bored.
I just want to go out and do something.
Lol I enjoy making credit card payments so when the next billing cycle comes in it looks like I might as well have not paid
My amusement level is nonexistent.
Hi, neighbor. I totally enjoy all the extra snow you decided to dump on the side and in front of my car. You're the best. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I mean....chocolate for breakfast is cool, right? Right.
Excuse me as I eat chocolate and proceed to still ugly cry over a card. #whatismylife
That moment when someone unfriends you with no explanation.  #lol #ok
There's normal people wearing pants and then there's me wearing a dress in freezing weather. Cuz why not?
I have soooo much to do. :(
Pretty sure I need to keep a constant supply of makeup wipes EVERYWHERE. #needit
Correction - contouring looks great if you can see what you're doing and aren't absolutely surprised when you look in your car mirror. #wtf
After trying it myself, I will now forever say contouring is the coolest thing ever.
@DeBaKai LMFAO. Next year!!!!
Holy shit. 
Works out since I'm STILL trying to figure out the name of a song almost 5 months later.
Oh, wonderful. I would somehow discover the company that provides the music for my job and find the playlist for the past 10 songs.
Just over everything. What else is new.
Why would I go in the Disney store while on a Disney kick? #badidea
Should've just decided to go to Disney next month.... #regret #needtogo #sad
2 new tweeps followed me in the last week. I find relevant people to follow with the #CopyFollowers feature of 
Yaaassssss I got picked to receive the coupon for the free Benefit Rollerlash sample.
@DeBaKai I will! :3
WEEEEEEEEEE
Literally can't believe I'm getting my hair done in 15 minutes. :3
Aaaandddd appointment made. Gaaaah.
Really hoping I can get my hair done todayyyy.
Is it 5 yet?
Should've found the last of my bag of ginger snaps from forever ago. Probably would be handy.
Accurate. ‚Äú@DeBaKai: Ugh...
#tired #pain‚Äù
Not a fan of this whole being sick thing right now.
I really just want to sleep.
Ugh.
Love last minute dates. :)
No. I promise you don't know me. #sadlyyoudo #no
Join me for the World's Largest #StarbucksDate @debakai 
@DeBaKai ugh. lol
@DeBaKai why would you condone that sort of behavior? ;P
@DeBaKai that requires even moooorrreeee effort because then I have to find one I even want to plaaayyyy
@DeBaKai but I don't feel like getting up. :(
@DeBaKai I'M SO BORED.
omg I'm so bored that I'm watching Twilight. #why
I‚Äôm ready to engage with my 5 new followers in the past week. I know them via 
Correction, every email that isn't a shared one had attempts. That's wonderful. Please tell me were playing a game rn.
Omg I totally love waking up to see someone tried to log in to ALL of my emails and they're not me. Fml.
What is your #2015Ambition? Have you taken any steps towards achieving it? #2015Ambition #crowdtappers 
I joined the #SaveTheUndies movement with @UbyKotex and became an underwarrior! 
I'm just done.
everything hurts..........
I just give up.
Sometimes my life is just a complete joke.
@DeBaKai always
@DeBaKai whaaat
@DeBaKai No, no. Now's good too.
@DeBaKai Sssoooo.....can we do it now orrrr-?
23 Incredibly Beautiful Elopements You Have To See 
The only time I ever drink anything is if I force myself to stick it in a cute cup. #itry
Pretty much going cross eyed from trying to do this fixture at work. Supposed to have both done today? LOLOLOL
literally everything hurts.
I'm just over everything right now.
I give up.
Days like today just really mess me up. :(
My mom has consistently told me I look like a slob for the past three weeks. #canileavehereyet #neverlookingback
Omg. On top of being sick and in pain from just about everything...my only decent fitting bra broke too. #overtoday #sad
I feel like I've been sick non-stop since November...and it just comes back harder in bursts. Like right now. #fml
Ughhh. I'm so tired. :(
I keep getting things for let's yo all the time...but basically none of them exist anymore, sooooo..........
Not to mention this headache.... #ow #needtonight
I wish that my shoulders and whatnot weren't tense as all hell. It hurts. :(
I just did the thing. I'm scared.
Wondering how to grow on twitter? I gained 4 followers in the past week. This is the app: 
@DeBaKai I love you toooo
@DeBaKai #sigh ok byeeeee. :(
@DeBaKai it doesn't have to be a snowman!
@DeBaKai hey....do you wanna build a snowman? Come on let's go and play! #waitedallyear #finallyrelevant
This shark is smiling. I'm not. #timingtimingtiming 
"White people get in free." Lmfao what?
I loveeee you!! ‚Äú@DeBaKai: Adventure time in NYC with @caitography ! #daywithwife #bestthingever #newyorknewyork‚Äù
Wet socks are no bueno.
Pretty sure it snowed literally everywhere but here.
Why is there a show about someone marrying into polygamy on? Better yet, why am I watching it?
Doing adult things like getting my car inspected. Soooo not fun.
Stores shouldn't open until like 11 or 12. I just want to sleeeeeeeep.
@DeBaKai omg. I hope it's around then. Or I'll cry! Or I'll feel bad cuz I get there later then you lol
@DeBaKai but I'm leaving for workkkkk
@DeBaKai I love how you're just like "ok." Lmfao &lt;3 I get out at 6 tonight. Do you think you'll be done by then?
@DeBaKai I'll explain later!!
@DeBaKai Christopherrrrr Panda Express date tonight? Since I think we might be screwed on Saturday cuz snow?
@DeBaKai not that much longer, like a week, but STILL. we've had the date wrong forever!!! :(
@DeBaKai SURPRISE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT.
This is what happens when I decide to REALLY clean out my emails.
OMG. MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE. CHRIS AND I STARTED TALKING EARLIER THAN I THOUGHT. NOT BY MUCH BUT STILL.
I'm having too much fun with this. #truestory
Omg I was so not into the idea of having a registry at BB&amp;B, but now I'm kinda glad that it's a thing. ALLLLL the things I want. &lt;3
Just got waaaayyy too excited over the fact that I don't have to do a Macy's registry because Bed, Bath, and Beyond has Kate Spade stuff! &lt;3
@misscaitieboo @melissy2107 omg this just made me so sad and so happy at the same time. Best thing to get out of work to see.
I'm reaaaallllyyyy over this same vendor trying to get ahold of me after I've told them no. How do you have such good reviews??
Ow.
Omg they're playing Friday is Forever at Outback. Soooo happy. Best music to eat dinner to ever @WeTheKings
Number crunching for the past week - 3 new unfollowers. Stats via 
Egg mountain! 
Well that was counterproductive
I'm officially feeling so many different things at once. #notfun
Nothing like my minimum payment jumping up for my Discover card. <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>

One of these nights I'll actually be able to sleep....
‚Äú@Wawa: Make room in your fridge for Wawa Half Gallon Teas &amp; Fruit Drinks! 3 for $5, any variety. 
@CharlesTrippy #ChallieQnA Where do you both see yourselves in 5 years? Do you think you'll both still be on YouTube?
@CharlesTrippy #challieqna What is your favorite vlog/memory together so far? and what are you two looking forward to in the future?
All of these Disney ads are killing me. I need to goooo.
I get such anxiety when I'm holding my phone and it vibrates instead of making a sound. I always think it's a phone call.
Why is it still so early?
I'm laughing so hard at @markiplier 's most recent video for sally.exe. The reactions are just beautiful
Having three days off in a row means insane wedding planning. I ain't even mad.
Officially just decided this will be a thing at my wedding... at least to a degree. 
True story, Christopher is the absolute best. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
60 days until I can say I've been together with my best friend for a year. &lt;3 Then 622 days until we say "I do!" So many daysssss~
Glad that 10 months later Christopher and I decided we were going to celebrate our anniversary on the wrong day...because it would've been
Love when I get to have dinner with my super indecisive future husband. ;P <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è

It's way too early to be up right now. #notafan
So many different places have gifts for registering with them! #thestruggleisreal #registereverywhere
Had a dream that I got a cuteeeee chocolate brown colored poodle. Now I really want it.
Why are you being so annoying?! Omfg.
"...it's not a wedding venue; it's a cultural institution that holds private events." Aka, when there's a wedding it's a wedding venue.
I think my favorite comment so far has been me breaking a washer that's been broken for months. Last I checked you broke it, but ok.
But no, me collecting Starbucks cards that take up NO SPACE is a problem. #makessense
I don't fucking comment on the fact you have a full room of shit that you never use and you constantly have to use a different room for shit
Apparently me having a ton of nail polish is a problem. As well as the fact I collect things. Not your shit, not your problem.
No really. I don't want to be in this house.
Omfg done.
Netflix, your payment always comes at like the worst possible times. #truestory #wellshit
Guess I'm up now that I've had yet another leg cramp. #ow #painful
I...I can actually see my floor? #whatisthis
I don't like that fake trees shed as much as real trees. And I desperately need to organize my closet...even though I wasn't planning to. :/
@DeBaKai ssooooo is tonight still a thing or-?
Definitely wasn't expecting to feel like I do right now....
Maybe one of these days I'll stop blaming myself for everything...today just isn't that day.
I hate that my mind always goes to the worst possible things ever.
Once upon a time, Caitlyn decided to lay on the floor. Turns out doing so was a terrible idea since she can barely breathe. #marathonrunner
I want froyo and chinese. #stresscravings #nowheresopen
woof.
Lol jk I'm probably not sleeping tonight.
Guess I'm going to bed because what's the use in staying up.
Best moment obviously being when she decided to snap her fingers at me like a dog to follow her. That totally didn't make me feel like shit
Can't figure out what incident made it to the top of my list...earlier today? Or the customer who literally made me find her everything.
Apparently that's just a fucking trend with everyone today. Literally everyone.
Really just fucking tired of people treating me like I'm 5. Yes, I'm fucking sick but don't talk to me like I can't do things.
Why do I even bother. Honestly.
Milk from two weeks ago doesn't get thrown out but a new thing of cookie dough does? #logic

As if my chest didn't hurt enough from the fact I can't breathe...the fact this venue charges $200 a head just killed me. Omfg.
Whyyyy am I still sick? Omfg.
Totally forgot that I kept my kinetic sand sandbox next to my bed....just stepped in it. That felt gross.
Why am I still sick af.
If my internet would stop cutting out every half hour that would be greaaaat
Can someone bring me Wawa orrrr-?
I just want Chris right now. :(
I literally hate calling out more than anything but literally everything hurts. Talking hurts. Breathing hurts. My head hurts. :(
I'm very disturbed to find out one of the songs I like is by Nick Jonas....since he sounds like a woman. #oops
I think like 80% of my friends list on Facebook is engaged now.
That was the most confusing movie ever. #wtf
Growing and engaging with the right tweeps - gained 1 new follower in the past week, courtesy 
Can't believe I can officially say that I'm marrying my best friend next year. :) #futuremrs
Oh yes. Because I absolutely wanted to start today off with a nose bleed. :|
I swear. Color correcting primer is magic.
Note to self - give mother old Naked 2 palette once new one is purchased. I now know why I hit the pan on my favorite color. :(
Ugh.
Buying my own shampoo and soap makes me feel like an adult. #dontknowwhy #goodstuff
Is it tomorrow yet?
I only *slightly* live off of dry shampoo.
I'm so tired. :(
Feeling so completely worn down right now... :(
Well that dream I had was extremely uncomfortable. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Omg I'm waaaaayyyyyy too tired right now. Zzzzzzz
#MerryChristmas 
That was weird to see a maker studio thing on the disney channel.
I've been cleaning for like...a week straight. How am I still not done?
3 tweeps followed (thank you!) and 5 unfollowed (goodbye!) me in the past week. Thank you 
Merry Christmas to me with my paycheck. And the first one of the new year is going to be even better? Guess all the hours are ok for now.
Is it 5, yet?
Gordon Ramsey is staring into my soul. 
I feel like my current goal in life is for makeup companies to send me things to review. I would be soooo happy.
I have no desire to even get out of my bed. #help
Maybe one of these days I'll be able to sleep normally....
Ugh.
I need a vacation....
Join me on @Influenster, the perfect shopping companion! 
I just want to sleep.... :(
Color correcting primer is literally the most amazing thing ever. Loveeee that it covers the red spots like magic!
So glad I have until Thursday to try and get my room clean because this isn't working out at all.
@DeBaKai #sigh alright. :(
@DeBaKai What time are you thinking now?
@DeBaKai &lt;3
almost 14 hours of work the next two days separate me from having a day off. my back is killing me.
I can't figure out if it's the foundation or the bottle it's in that smell like paint. #awkward
Haven't done this in a while - 645 days!
@DeBaKai I mean at some point the wawa gods will give in. #WawaGiftCard
I have work in two hours. Not looking forward to it at all today. #inpain #ow
My back is killllling me. :(
@EdgarAllanBr0 never too early to eat left over Chinese food.
@MarziaPie That's really pretty wrapping paper!
Beyond miserable right now.
The next few days are going to be soooo long. :(
Is it Tuesday yet?
@DeBaKai I loovvveeeeee youuu &lt;3
@DeBaKai ;) ;) ;) ;) &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Sssoooooo...if someone I know could make me something like this for my nail polish. ;) 
I feel like I'm going to be sick for the next 900 years.
Number crunching for the past week - 4 new followers and 4 unfollowers. Stats via 
Going back to bed so maybe I stop feeling sick again.... Just not amused by today already.
I mean....leaving a message so I know why I was being called this early in the morning would've been great. Especially since my head hurts.
I want to take a shower....but the effort required to get up and do it is real.
I get slightly terrified when my room is somewhat clean.
:) 
@DeBaKai omg. I don't even remember what I'm supposed to say after....lol
@DeBaKai #loveyoumore <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@DeBaKai #foreverthesweetest
I was looking forward to my mom working so I could get things done...but apparently she's off and wants to do things. #help
New York City at night is seriously one of my absolute favorite things ever.
Why the hell am I not recording this right now?
Baaasssten maaahket where you get you authentic New England cuisine.
I will never be able to get over how absolutely handsome my future husband is. He is one damn good looking man. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I will also never understand how $1 off is considered a sale. It might as well be regular price.
Sometimes I hate being in this area because I really see people I don't want to see.
The only thing that kills me about this movie right now is it's almost 3 hours long. #help
I'm just on a tweeting spree right now. I don't even care.
Just had a wedding vendor email me from her phone. You, my dear, are dedicated.
I'm not complaining about being asked to work in the least, I'm complaining about the fact that I always feel obligated and hate saying no.
Officially turning my phone off for the next few hours. Can't remember the last time I did this, but I can't deal with this right now.
I've literally been asked to work every day since Saturday by someone.......
Finding a random Facebook you forgot you had can be interesting...learn quite a bit. Nice to see I predicted a few things. #amused
I have way too much stuff to wrap now. -__-
I loveee mornings where I wake up and have problems breathing correctly. I feel like I just ran a marathon.
Thought Chris was going to whisper something sweet to me in my ear while we were snuggling...instead it was something about pizza. #ohok
I'm sooooo hungry. But I'm too lazy to go out right now.
@Wawa @DeBaKai Attempting this again because it would be nice to have a random Wawa dinner. Plus I wanted that milkshake. #WawaGiftCard
I've been up for like...ever...and I'm being so unproductive it isn't even funny. #ohwell
I seriously can't stand when websites decide they need to change. Don't do that. You worked fine before.
It's almost 6 in the morning and for the past hour I've been trying to make a shopping list. This is dangerous.
It's moments like right now where I wish I had people close by to do things with at stupid hours in the night. :(
The temptation to go out and get a milkshake from Wawa is real right now.....
@BatmanRobinC 
The naked on the run palettes lip gloss is literally the same shade as my natural lip color. #ohok
@DeBaKai that and it's huge fluffy pieces. :X
@DeBaKai it just started here

@DeBaKai Basically.
Not a fan of the fact my whole head feels fluffy.
Noooo. More of my nail polish has dried out. I need to replenish my supply! #sadtweet
I would turn The Little Mermaid on right at the start of Poor Unfortunate Souls.
I absolutely can't stand when my iMac just randomly turns itself on and I have no idea why. It's done it since I bought it.
KNP IS ON DAY 3 OF HER 12 DAYS OF GIVEAWAYS, ENTER FOR FREE HERE AT A CHANCE TO WIN!! 
@spikedudej Do you know who I'm talking about?
How come a ton of people aren't concerned over the fact a 16 year old and a 21 year old are together? Like...does no one see the problem?
I'm sorry, but if I continually deny your friend request...it probably means I don't want to be your friend or I don't know you.
Besides being asked how my ex and I were doing...today wasn't too terrible at  work.
@DeBaKai So. We get married now, yes?
@DeBaKai I can tell lol
KNP is on Day 2 of her 12 Days of Giveaways, enter for FREE here! 
@DeBaKai But then we might as well wait for Friday at that point...since I work late and the whatnot. :/
@DeBaKai I wish that could be a thing. :(
@DeBaKai I just want to be with you. :(
@DeBaKai Well, if it gets to be 2 and I'm still not out, then I will. I'm just. Ugh.
@DeBaKai I would rather have the hours while they're there because I know that they're going to be non-existent in like...a month. Or week.
@DeBaKai I wanted to go in today so I'm going. But I'm trying to like....not be late and I feel like that's not going to happen.
Have a severe love/hate relationship with the fact I'm working today.
I'm just getting so annoyed with everything.
Very pleasantly surprised by the difference Tarte's Best in Faux mascara actually makes. Yay for fibers!
@DeBaKai #fuckyeah
@DeBaKai @SerebiiNet ...I want one.
@DeBaKai We're getting married now, too, right? #letsdothis #evenmoreimpatient
@DeBaKai #absolutelyperfect
@DeBaKai Seriously that would just be absolutely wonderful. I would love to just snuggle up with you again. Maybe breakfast in bed, too?
@DeBaKai Seriouslyy. I'm absolutely miserable because I'm tired as all hell and I just want to be with you. #hatethis #allthemoney

I've had this account for two years now, according to Twitter. Niceeee. Happy #Twitterversary to me.
Holy traffic on 287.
Are scene kids a thing, still?
Camp Takota is on Netflix now? #YesPlease
@DeBaKai :(
@DeBaKai it doesn't stay down though. :(
I don't like that drinking water scares me. :(
This commercial for engagement rings is hysterical. Love it.
@DeBaKai Ok :(

@DeBaKai or start back up rather
@DeBaKai well I mean it actually made it worse
@DeBaKai didn't do anything.
Hoping a shower makes me feel a little better. :( #miserable #sick
I should probably clean, take a shower, and pack....but instead I'll just keep playing Pokemon. #procrastinator #lastminuteeverything
I'm super hungry. #help #sof #sendoutfood

@satans_hellpopx Plus you love me anyway so you'd have to keep it. Like...in a frame in the backroom, too.
@satans_hellpopx Well, TECHNICALLY legally you have to accept applications. What you do with them is whatever, but you have to take them. :*
How come everywhere I live is like...an hour away for everything.
@satans_hellpopx Lol give me a few months and then we'll talk officially about it. :P It would make my life soo much easier...except far lol
@satans_hellpopx SEASONAL OR LEGIT? Plus I need to wait a few months. Should be heading up north, finally. <SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
662 days away. T.T #sofaraway
@satans_hellpopx Also, of course my congratulations tweet is the one that gets sent to draft so I look like an asshole...but CONGRATULATIONS
@satans_hellpopx I feel like I should just be a part of your store. I feel like I would love life. :P Lemme know when y'all are hirrriiing
This is like, the worst shark week ever. #isitdoneyet #fml
This suckkksssssass.
I think cat kisses are better than dog kisses because kitty kisses don't show up as frequently. #love
I literally haven't worked at Kohls in years. Explain to me why I had to teach a cashier how to use the register and how to use the coupon.
K. Well that was easily the strangest dream I've had in a while.
We've gone from a corner to like....my whole room it feels like. #somuchchristmas 
@DeBaKai #iwish #missyoutoomuch
@DeBaKai #toomuchtimeonyourhands
There's still 664 days to go. #why
To wrap the rest of these presents or not #thatisthequestion
@satans_hellpopx Girllll I could've gone for that from this past week
My room is going to be just....completely Christmas. #omg
@DeBaKai Fiiinnnneeeeeeeeeeeee #resigned
@DeBaKai But noooo! lol
@DeBaKai I showed you the website to show you how to do it hahaha. #totallydifferent
@DeBaKai lol what have I taught you? You've taught me more. #fixedthemac #thanks
@DeBaKai This is true lol. I'm just a terrible teacher though.
@DeBaKai If I didn't have to do a bajillion things first I would cuz you know I would love to have breakfast with you. Cuz I love that
@DeBaKai omg and then I'm going to have to do it for you when you convert. omg. #helpme #nooooooo
I hate being the only one in my family who knows how to use Apple products. Leave me alone. I don't want to do the thing.
@DeBaKai Because...you're going to see me? LIKE I TOLD YOU.
I'm hungry and there's nothing in the house. #ugh
@satans_hellpopx omg this is so true. we're the masters of doing this. &lt;3
Here I thought I was going to hit platinum status at my store...only to see I still need to spend another $134 to get it. :| #no
Glad I apparently don't know how to put my phone on the charger. <NEUTRAL FACE>
@DeBaKai k so I'm at work. I love you. Remember that.
@DeBaKai you suck at describing yourself today. #justsaying
@DeBaKai **teddybear FTFY
@DeBaKai oh you mean the fate where we have like 900 kids? #ok #soundsgood
@DeBaKai *why do I not look at my Facebook messages FTFY.
The next 4 1/2 hours are going to be the longest 4 1/2 hours ever....
@DeBaKai Will you read your damn messages
@DeBaKai if you go, i go. just saying.
@DeBaKai could you like...not
This is why I don't fucking bother getting excited about anything
Cool. The tree is broken. I'm done.
I'm just done with everything.
Putting anything electronic together with someone who has no clue how to do it is beyond frustrating. I would've been done 20 minutes ago.
Setting up this tree is both annoying and therapeutic.
Now what.
Literally cut my friend's list by more than half. That was nice.
Note to self - don't almost delete the brother of the lead singer of the band you love. He writes nice statuses.
Guess I can be productive and cut a lot of people off my friends list on Facebook. I mean, what's the point of having them there anymore.
Guess it's a glasses kind of day since my left eye currently doesn't want to be normal. #no
Seriously don't feel good right now.
every part of me is just extremely exhausted.....
Wow. Thanks guys.
Time it took me to shop right now - literally 1 minute.
There's only so many times certain things can be done or said before you start questioning everything about yourself.
So much for sleeping...
Maybe everything really has always been my fault.....
@DeBaKai CHRISTOPHER.
i'm literally going to throw up.
Didn't want to go out tonight, but definitely worth it. Basically done shopping AND bought a tree. Can't wait to decorate it!
Three more things and then I'm DONEEEEEE
Totally getting more than I had intended. Like...a lot more.
Christopher is going to be hella spoiled.
All I wanted was to buy a tree......
I swear I'm going to wind up on the news for punching someone in the face. #sorryinadvance
Just going to tweet my shopping experience today. Because. Why not.
Buying a crock pot. Because why not.
Why the actual fuck are people buying pillows at full price?
Lmfao I've literally never hated people more than right now.
Omg my face hurts now. Aunt kisses are almost killer. X.x
Oh god. Shopping with my aunt is dangerous. And I was squeezed to death. Holy hell.
@DeBaKai But it's not.
@DeBaKai but it's not the same thing to me.
@DeBaKai that's different than outright saying you didn't have to go
@DeBaKai when did you even tell me that? Cuz you didn't.
@DeBaKai you never said that. Sooooooo
@DeBaKai The only way I would've been ok with today is if I was just with you. That's it.
Today only made me realize how much I absolutely hate the holidays no matter what.
I'm just literally over everything right now.
I got a notification, but my phone's on my bed and I'm sitting at my desk. #lazy
Yay for friends who have almost all of the expansion packs for The Sims 3 and shares their information so you can get everything again.
@EdgarAllanBr0 I thought you were following me too. o__O;
"what kind of broccoli do you want?" I mean....is there other kinds of broccoli?
I literally feel beyond lazy today.
Pretty sure I just stained my eyebrows black. That's awkward. Commence insane makeup removing tactics
Omg. Just decided to use a trick to find the super light hairs when I pluck my eyebrows and I would look absolutely terrible with dark brows
Not sure if tired...or awake. Although, I'm extremely, extremely, extremely damn bored.
If @WeTheKings could rewrite every one of their songs as acoustic, life would be good. #relaxing
Actually...the keyboard is basically impossible to use. Wonderful.
I would've laughed so hard just now if I killed my MacBook by restarting it. That would've been the icing on the cake today.
@EdgarAllanBr0 I'll look and see if I have any of my old books! I might have a few hanging around somewhere.
Aaaannnndddd I also need more ornaments since apparently the ones I had were thrown out because they were on the tree. :| #fail
Guess I need to buy a new tree. #sigh
I really want to go out right now....
i give up.
My car runs like its brand new. This is weird.
Anyone want to do anything tonight? No. Ok.
So. Bored. Someone talk to me. Sos.
My moms going to be out of work before my car is done. Omg.
Omg I just really want a hug. Like a long snugly one....
Omg. The old couple on the couch across from me are cuddling and reading a book together. I want to do that....
Well, that's something I haven't wanted to do in a long time... #feelingweird
@DeBaKai the coffee crack card for life is kinda ugly. I like the gold....but the craters are weird. 
I mean, being completely clueless is cool, right?
I wish I had 5 Nights at Freddy's on my iPad and I refuse to buy anything for, iTunes unless it's with a gift card.
Omg. This panini is delicious.
I mean...I know that my car is going to cost a ton, but having lunch bought for me was a nice gesture. Sometimes people don't suck.
Totally love the days where no one talks to me. <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
Well today is special. Always something....
These couches are terrible.
He has a Mickey shirt on and I have my Finding Nemo shirt on.
He's currently my spirit animal. We have a bond over Disney right now without speaking.
It's nice to know that everyone in this waiting room is bored as all hell. The lucky middle aged man in the wheely chair is spinning around
iPad, stop doing every single update. Thanks.
Honestly I'm just getting annoyed with everything.
I have to be up at 9 so I can get my car fixed. Butttttt too awake. #strugglecity
Wrapping Christopher's Christmas presents to make myself feel better right now. Don't know why that would help, but oh well.
Beyond annoyed right now.
I always mess up my own Starbucks order anymore. #imsosorry #tootired
Omg I absolutely adore the acoustic version of Queen of Hearts.
Yyyaaaassssssssssssssssssss
Yyyeeeessssssssss.
Wait, is The Little Mermaid actually on right now?
Now I'm sad because I have no idea where my Christmas tree is. #wanttodecorate
Basically fought with my pillows last night, I guess. All of them were on the floor when I woke up. #ok
I love how my mom has to make it a point to make the statement "nobody moves up north" at least once a day
@DeBaKai Lmfao cuz you're crazy lol <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Just because I tweet 900 times in a day doesn't mean my fianc√© should too. :P <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è #iloveyou
If 4 could come super fast that would be great. That and if I could have patience. That's helpful today.
Well my hopes of getting Starbucks were completely dashed by this lovely amount of traffic. #sadtweet
Apparently if you get several emails at once your phone just goes off non-stop. #thatfeltweird
I wasn't intending on cleaning any part of my room before I left for work and I wound up doing it anyway. Crap.
The noise my back just made from it popping was disgusting, but felt amazing.
I mean....I could probably clean my room instead of just throwing everything on my bed....but the effort that requires is too real.
Reminder - double check who's name/number I have any rewards/shopping cards under. That was awkward.
@DeBaKai :(
It would be great if I could breathe normally right now
@DeBaKai that's why I never need to drink. :P
@DeBaKai I don't know lol
@DeBaKai I don't know.
I can never make up my mind...On one hand I get annoyed with working and then on the other I get annoyed when I have to work. #logic
Omg. I want this. It's not like I don't have enough already... fml. - 
@DeBaKai I really just don't want to go out though and I don't feel like calling them. #thestruggleisreal
I guess maybe I could be moderately productive and get my schedule for work....
The more wedding photos I look at, the more I absolutely need the photographer I want. I don't want the "typical" airbrushed photos, thanks.
Do people complaining about Obama saying he's doing things for more voters reallllyyyyy not know that he can't run again?
@PandaExpress Enjoying a nice night out with my fianc√© is how I #ShareJoy nothing better than quality time together!
So....top priorities for my wedding - photographer and videographer. Damn it. Soooo expensive.
So, if the next 675 days could go by fasterrrr, that would be greaaaaatttt
Excuse me? "Boy Shocked By Electricity Says He Has Superpowers Like Magneto" 
@DeBaKai NO.
I'm way too awake right now but too lazy to actually do anything. The struggle is real.
I really just want to go to Playlist Live this weekend....
My heart just broke over the chick wearing the WRONG color foundation. Get on those winter colors!! Your face is too dark!
Only useful thing that came out of the worst years ever...apparently my BJ's membership is good until 2045. Nice.
@DeBaKai I'll message you. And omfg, if you bring me cookies &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
I just can't understand how someone can literally go on vacation literally every two months. Like....how.
I mean, honestly, I would love to be the person whose parents literally pay for just about everything sometimes.
@DeBaKai &lt;______&lt;
I just really want chocolate chip cookies right now. &lt;/3
‚Äú@ultimatedeath91: We have to win! Pizza it the perfect programming food. #OCVTSCompSci #ocvts‚Äù @OCVTS
‚Äú@ultimatedeath91: #OCVTSCompSci is awesome! #OCVTS‚Äù @OCVTS
‚Äú@Alex_Pitera: #ocvtsCompSci you are officially bae‚Äù @OCVTS
‚Äú@RyanWolff97: I like #ocvtscompsci‚Äù @OCVTS
@DeBaKai so then it was probably yours. Well, shit. Lmfao. Works out for me because I only had half of mine. What did you get?
@DeBaKai oh fuck. You got it too?!
@DeBaKai never mind. Finally saw that it went through. At least it only went through once
@DeBaKai the card wasn't scanning lol. Either I wasn't charged or I was charged 900 times
@DeBaKai NO
Did...did I just get my drink for free?!
Stores that have limited availability whenever I need to get something, I hate you because you make life difficult for me. #annoyinghunt
@DeBaKai like even the change is fine for the number you gave me...just off by $20 lmfao
@DeBaKai if I knew where I put it.....lmfao
@DeBaKai I went based off my paycheck and did the math from that lol
@DeBaKai could you message me the breakdown? I might've missed something but like I said idk what
@DeBaKai Nope
@DeBaKai the only cash I took out was that $80
@DeBaKai I'm off by $20 then. Idk where though
@DeBaKai and I used cash so the only thing there would be is McDonald's from yesterday
@DeBaKai does that include the 18.52 from your part of Ulta?
@DeBaKai nah. I'll save it
Literally leaving for work early today JUST to get Starbucks. I need it.
Just did something I haven't done in months and purely out of an extremely old habit. Don't know why.
@DeBaKai I want you here againnn :( :(
My head hurts so bad today. :(
Wtf We The Kings. Yay for new album but boo for waiting so long when I spent so much money today.
It's not like I didn't know, but it's funny to see who's suddenly absent in my life.
Well, that was special. Is it 2, yet???
@satans_hellpopx Did you try sterling? I'm surprised gold didn't work for you because it's hypoallergenic because it's pretty pure
@satans_hellpopx Wait...how the hell did I not notice this. REALLY? WAT. GET ON THAT SHIT, DAMN IT.
@satans_hellpopx So, there you go. You could get hoops and if you hate it you can use them for your ears! lmfao.
@satans_hellpopx Depending on what gauge you decided to go for, you could probably get hoops and have them double if you dont like it
@satans_hellpopx Lmfao I was trying to come up with a joke for that, but I can't lol. Idk mine are sensitive as is and thats why I won't lol
@satans_hellpopx My nipples hurt thinking about you getting your nipples pierced...but I've considered it myself lol
Can't upload on YouTube right now. x.X Faaaiiilll. Why won't it work?!
Finally cracked open the Burts Bees Chris bought me for my birthday last month. #neededit
Chris supports my Starbucks addiction wwaaaaayyyyy too much.


I'm going to need this in my life like...at some point.
Why can't it come in mint like this $400 one I just saw?
Why does the camera I want ONLY come in purple in stores?
@YouTuberShouts Shout this video! :) 

PROPOSAL IN CENTRAL PARK (11.11.14 - Day 4) 
I really hate admitting the fact I actually enjoy Taylor Swift's song Blank Space. #no #stop
If you have a moment, please fill out this survey for me! 
I'm getting way too invested in Five Nights at Freddy's. This is a problem.
682 daysssss.
@DeBaKai lol, ooh alright.
@DeBaKai Now that's a phrase I can't recall you using in a while. Unless I haven't paid attention haha. ;P
@DeBaKai Don't judge me!!!
Tyler Oakley is going to be in New Brunswick on the 9th of next month? Omg I better have off from work.
I earned the Gold Badge at My Starbucks Rewards. Start earning your Badges! @StarbucksGold 
Just need to remember I only have to get through 4 hours today. Just 4 and I'm good.
Have the starts of the biggest and most disgusting blister on my one foot. Yaaaayyyyy.
"You're delicate like Venus fly trap." -@DeBaKai #thanks
@satans_hellpopx oh lmfao xD
@satans_hellpopx What do you mean the day is wrong? Lol
@satans_hellpopx You're exceptionally bubbly today &lt;3
And what makes my last status even more lame is the difference in service with another customer when I was being nice. Ok. Makes sense.
While I understand @Starbucks in @Target isn't a full store, I'm less than thrilled by my service today. #lame #wow
@DeBaKai stttooopppp <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I'm never going to be able to leave at this rate. #omg #movefaster
@DeBaKai you're seriously the best. #iloveyousomuch
@DeBaKai yes, please
@DeBaKai well if someone wasn't so overly excited to get rid of it, would've been fine. #fixmeplz
Aaannnndddddd almost broke my hand trying to take our old tv off its stand. #ow #pain #help
Omg it's actually gorgeous out. #sowarm
As excited as I am for today, it's way too early to be up.
@gadvonline on my hard drive currently. I'll share them at some point
Omfg. This child....is adorable. #help #iwantone #uhm 
omg I want to have a kid just so I can take it cool places and do cool things and be like, "I'm awesome cuz I showed you this."
@DeBaKai oh my dear lord lol
Can't waaaiiittt to be with Christopher tomorrowww &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
omg I think I'm way too excited over what lori and I are talking about. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@satans_hellpopx I knowww! We need to do that soon!
@satans_hellpopx WHO IS THIS ABOUT?! OMG. WHAT. TEXT. NEED 2 NO WATS GOING ON.
@satans_hellpopx omfg we should have a disney movie marathon together.
@DeBaKai omg yes
Other downside - the questions I'm sure I'll have when I get out of work in a few hours. #fun #neededtobedone
Downside - I'm annoyed, but the plus side is I'm beyond overjoyed at saying shit I've wanted to say for years.
There is literally so much that can be said about the conversation I beyondddd shut down. I might even mention it in the vlog.
Lolololol I wish I knew who was the rat on my Facebook page. Oh, well.
So, apparently the songs Love the Way you Lie and the Forever by Papa Roach are reasons for still caring-? I mean....really.
Like....can we not?
Is it Tuesday yet?
Good morning to me, I guess...
Why, yes...let's just have almost ALL of my ex's contact me in one day. This is weird as hell.
Literally need to get to Walt Disney World JUST so I can meet Baymax. He's too cute.
Almost walked directly into a spider that decided to suspend itself in the hallway. Going to throw up that's how scared I got. #hatespiders
That moment when your phone has way too many notifications than it should ever need. X.x #no
@DeBaKai I don't know. I'm confused. And scared. And confused.
@DeBaKai The fact he was somehow in the hallway is scary enough...just found him. I think you got me the Chucky equivalent of a bear....
@DeBaKai Note to self - don't let you do that again. I'm scared lol.
@DeBaKai I think Flynn's alive....lol
@DeBaKai He like...ran away. I shit you not.
I literally have no idea where my bear went....O__o
Basically 3 hours worth of writing to come out to 6,019 words. Might actually finish this years NaNoWriMo. #maybe
This kid literally just ran into a chair, fell down, and then got back up as if nothing ever happened. #wtfdude
@DeBaKai Yesss!! Hold on, I'll message you lol. Too long for Twitter.
@DeBaKai Well...true. AND HEY, GUESS WHAT? I'm *hopefully* finally getting music for our vlogs from someone lol.
@DeBaKai It was such a surreal moment, though. Like....what?
688 days. I feel like it's going to get to the year mark really fast.
@DeBaKai Oh, I forgot to tell you yesterday, but at work yesterday, I had a moment where it REALLY hit me that you're going to be my husband
@DeBaKai &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@DeBaKai You'd beeettteeerrrr loveeee ittttt. :(
@DeBaKai ouch. :(
@DeBaKai Its called love. #dealwithit
@DeBaKai I mean....let's be real....we're turning into the same person sssoooooooo.....
@DeBaKai gave what stuff to you? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???
@DeBaKai hey! Sounds like me!
@satans_hellpopx omfg that's too cute
I need work to go super fast today.
@Jessewelle Love the new camera! What are you using now?
Just took 4 minutes to export the first vlog back for tomorrow. I might cry. Now if only YouTube uploads were just as fast.
Excuse me, Twitter....but why the hell did you change your interface on the physical website?
@ADDisn3y sucks 4 u
WISHFUL THINKING.
Please tell me I woke up early for no reason. That would be great.
Uhm.
Feel like absolute hell right now. <DISAPPOINTED FACE> Literally no one should be up this early. #Ijustwanttosnuggle #fml
Just found out I did go to @gadvonline 's Online Day last year. There's pictures and everything. #oh #couldntremember
@_tsmithh Haha it was probably him, then. :) If I didn't have a crazy customer at the register I would've helped him more! lol
Welp, Walt Disney World crushed my dreams of my gorgeous garland covered Main Street USA picture for Christmas... :( #dontlikechange #stopit
I mean, I knew there was going to be a ton of updates, but still. Oh, well. Can't wait for it to be completely up and running!
I just really want to edit the four days worth of video vlog and get everything all set up again.
@_tsmithh I'm like 99.9% sure your dad came into my store to buy something for your mom. He seemed very overwhelmed by the store lol.
Loooovvveeeee this DIY wedding! 
692 days.
Watching these wedding fail videos on America's Funniest Videos makes me worried. How about we not have any of these happen?
I have too many flowers on my desk and I can't look at them all at the same time because there's no room left. #firstworldproblems
I don't like the fact I have to wait 5 more minutes to find out if I did this right...
@DeBaKai :(
Omg. My legs hurt so bad.
Had I known we could've done special makeup for work that isn't "normal" (by our standards) I totally would've done an OITNB look.
@DeBaKai don't try!! Do it!
No. Seriously. Last tweet. Chris. Get on that.
No, seriously. Pretty sure Chris should just come down tonight and snuggle with me. And maybe fix my computer. And watch a movie. #please
Lolol apparently my trick for Halloween is having to go to work early. #WhyDidIAgreeToThis Maybeeee I'll have a nice treat though-?
or not since i see now it says online only. #fml
omg. my store is carrying the epic eyeshadow/blush set that i want. guess i'll be getting it anyway.
Holy hell my latte is extremely hot today.
@spikedudej k. Just thought I would double check and see if anyone was going tomorrow.
@spikedudej Are you going to the park tomorrow?
@spikedudej I should be. Can't go Saturday because I close, though. Determined to go on Sunday, but wouldn't be there until late I think
@spikedudej I know.... -______-
Curling my hair is the worst thing ever sometimes.
I'm extremely bored right now...
@satans_hellpopx yeah it is!
Do you ever hear songs and then just go, "Well, shit" all because that song is just completely ruined for you? #yup
Fries are sad when they're reheated.
@satans_hellpopx omg I couldn't do it. Worst. Thing. Ever.
@satans_hellpopx Omg. I was genuinely concerned you were like one of those people who have to get naked to poop...but for teeth brushing
@satans_hellpopx I think the more important question is whyyyy are you brushing your teeth naked? Like, did you strip just for that?? o__O
So, there's a hair removal tool called "Yes" now. It looks exactly like the "Nono." I hate everyone.
Anddd one more like until I hit 100 likes on my Caitography facebook page. Weird.
@spikedudej I'm totally down for pizza bagels.
I love how it's impossible to hear back from some venues, but yet I've had one email me EVERY DAY. #stopit
Also, I'm genuinely frustrated by this nurse who refuses to do her quarantine. Yeah, she's probably fine, but that's NOT the point.
Totally enjoy waking up feeling sick. Awesome.
Aaaannnnddddd my computer decided to just randomly die. Not like it really even mattered...
Well.........
If I could stop sneezing that would be wonderfullll
@DeBaKai Ssshhhh. You'll know next year.
Like this is a genuine problem for me right now. #truestory
I have 4 1/2 months to work on what I'm working on currently, but I feel like that's not enough time at all. Fml.
Oh crap....Nanowrimo starts at the end of the week and I still don't have any idea what to write about.
Oh my dear lord I've been looking into wedding venues for going on 5 days now and it's already stressful. #budgetproblems
Is it tomorrow yet?
Super interesting study that actually makes sense when you think about it - 
Well...shit...things could get really interesting.
Today has been the biggest source of aggravation ever. Not even going to bother acting like I've been fine today anymore.
@DeBaKai I thought about that. Maybe.
@DeBaKai oneeee of these dayssss
@DeBaKai exactly.
Keep thinking I get responses back from venues. Nope. Just Twitter telling me I have a notification.
.@DeBaKai Bacon is everyone's best friend. Unless you're a vegetarian. Or weird.
@DeBaKai Ssssooooo....maybe we should work on that at some point and get it out of the way.
@DeBaKai she's weird. I think she has an eating disorder. Bacon on the other hand....completely different.
@DeBaKai Hey, I just realized we can finally start our registry...and not have it be weird.
@DeBaKai I don't think she is
@DeBaKai not even then... -_-
I like this. Makes me feel a lot better. ‚Äú@BestProAdvice: 
Normal dogs just eat. Not mine. I have to force feed her. So aggravated right now.

@_tsmithh @uhhhhlexis_ I've had the same Twitter for months, shit head!
@_tsmithh @uhhhhlexis_ ok, I'll give you that lol. I was thinking about Dick the other day too. #funtimes
@_tsmithh @uhhhhlexis_ it's cool. Don't mention me, brat
For ONCE it wouldn't have been my fault if my charger for my MacBook was broken. Omg.
I'm literally going to do a countdown for the next 699 days. #sorrynotsorry
Absolutely loved waking up and seeing my ring this morning. :)
Had I known my hair and makeup was going to basically stay completely intact from yesterday, I wouldn't have gotten up so early.
701.
Laughing so hard at these three guys trying to pick chicks up. LOLOLOL they're walking fast because they know you're stalking them idiots.
I hate that drag queens are always prettier than me. Teach me your ways. Please.
The mall is literally the best place to sit and judge people's fashion choices.
Stress headache. Wweeeeeeeee
Who in their right minds would spend $200 for food per person? With a 125 person minimum? Buy a house.
@DeBaKai Oh, well that's where I'm from! It's perfect!
@DeBaKai Purple is normal.
@DeBaKai Then....what color? lol
I think I need a purple lipstick now.... 
@DeBaKai Message me
Basically depressed right now. Nice.
Ugh. :(
I need my feet rubbed. x.x
Chris and I just reaaalllyyyy need to have our own place.
Reaallyyyy just need to live in a place that has two bathrooms for once in my life. I would like to have more than 5 minutes to get ready
Totally forgot that I have off tomorrow.
Soooo I can snuggle tonight yet orrrrr-?
I like how I literally ordered something last night and forgot about it. Woooow.
165 people? Really? That's such a random ass number.
I'm scared. My room is actually clean, my laundry is done, and I took a shower. All before 3. I think I'm sick.
@ADDisn3y well, then....
@ADDisn3y I don't know. I would hope you would vaguely remember your adventure in the woods.
704. :X
@ADDisn3y that...was a very strange night. Is that the night you went into the woods for whatever reason?
@ADDisn3y Are you drunk already? Lol
And oh wow @harto is on The Chew right now. Wish I could've gone to that show.
That was the creepiest 5 minutes of my life.
My dogs a jerk.
Between 10 and 2 doesn't mean get to the house at 2...but I mean....that's cool, too I guess.
This dude has an hour to get here. Ugh.
@spikedudej @KaiserCoaster Basically.
@spikedudej @KaiserCoaster I'm so confused.
@KaiserCoaster @spikedudej How is Wednesday the new Tuesday?
So, if this dude that's supposed to fix the heater could get here soon and just....fix it so I can do the shit I need to do...yeaaah.
I feel like one of these days I'll be doing a haul. Just missing two eyeliners and my mascara in this photo. :X 
And by having a floor I mean I picked everything up off of it and put it somewhere else...thus eliminating a different space.
Omg. I have a floor again. For now.
Also - Christopher is super handsome.
I don't think I have enough. 
Clearly I've never been a fan of socks because I still have 2 out of 3 pairs in good condition from 12 years ago. That's scary.
Would pretty much love to just be snuggled up and watching a movie with Christopher today. :(
So, uh....I really want meatballs right now........

@DeBaKai ssshhhhhhhhh
Thinking of literally the perfect day. It's a problem. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@DeBaKai They're only cute when they're not going in 5 different directions lol
@DeBaKai K, well. Lol
@DeBaKai Thank youu. &lt;3 CUZ MY EYEBROWS ARE MEAN.
@DeBaKai except for you that's like....$5 hahaha
@DeBaKai Alright. That's logical. Lmfao
@DeBaKai Pllleeeeaaaassseeeeee remind me to buy my clear gel the next time I'm with you!
@DeBaKai I still need supervision hahaha.
Need to set a reminder for myself to FINALLY buy my eyebrow setting gel...after I get them done, I guess....
NOOOO. JUST REALIZED I FORGOT THE SAMEEEE THING I NEEDED TO GET. AGAIN.
@DeBaKai You might have to come supervise.... lol. I need an adult. :P
@DeBaKai Maybe shopping with Cassandra will be a terrible idea.... lmfao.
@DeBaKai I got talked into the one thing!! Which actually saved me $20 to begin with lol. Finally asked one of the girls for help lol
Ooops. Went to only get my makeup remover...walked out with more. #thestruggleisreal #oops 
And just cuz, 705.
Places I want to get to before the years over: NYC, Philly, Bushkill Falls, SHEETZ, and Cape May. There's probably more, but can't think.
If we could just not with the weird dreams that would be greaaaaaaat.
Yyeeeesssssssss. And I still need to get my birthday drink. 
Did I tweet this already? I don't think I tweeted this yet. I'm excited. 
@DeBaKai :)
@DeBaKai Make meee!!!
I will literally never trust any correspondence with someone named Daisy..... #weirdestemailever
@DeBaKai It's your fault!!!!
I just really want to do a countdown....
It's amazing to hear what Charles has to say outside of the vlogs and it just completely hits home in ways. Omg.
Sitting and watching a video someone took of the Vlogumentary screening at Buffer Fest and I'm literally crying. Omfg.
Anything from Calima will forever be my downfall. #damnit #addictedsincedayone
I'm just going to tweet random nonsense until I have to go to work. Cuz like...yeah.
@DeBaKai Christopherrr!!! I love you so much! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
I love that I have my window open right now...and that it still feels like it's 100+ in my room. #inhomesauna #omg #no
I hate having really weird dreams. :(
Waze ups the creep factor up by like a bajillion points
Oh wait. They did her eyebrow and then added three ear piercings. Alrighty then.
Why would someone think it's ok to pierce someone else's eyebrow in the middle of the mall?
Omg. The white chocolate mocha tastes weird as hell when I've been getting pumpkin spice lattes for weeks
Just put jeans on for the first time in three weeks. This is strange. I've been living out of my work clothes for almost a month.
@DeBaKai I have to stop home when I get out of work apparently. X.x So 5 would be betterererer
Never at any point did I press "restart now." Especially while not in the room. 
Omfg. Today is going to be one of those days, isn't it?
Yes, because playing with the hot water heater is ALWAYS a smart idea while I'm in the shower.
Just need to try and get through the next few hours....
@DeBaKai @satans_hellpopx #yayfornotificationsoff #twohourslater #700newnotifications #thisshowiscray #yayrealitytv #dreamcometrue
FINALLY cleaning my room. It's only been the whole month since I've been meaning to.
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai #weregoingtokillchrissphone #cantapostraphe #fuck
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai #wellshit
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai I KNOW. IT'S AMAZING. #yayfornotbeinglosers #makingmyownhashtags #maybe #aretheyreal
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai YAY FRIENDS!
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai Lol I can do that! xD
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai ONLY IF I'M OFF THOUGH! D:
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai Alright wellllll if we go I'll send him a text so he's not by himself! Unless he was going with people already?
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai oh well that would defeat the purpose of visiting if you're there that late lol
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai Really? What time was he thinking of going?
@DeBaKai @satans_hellpopx Definitely no promises with tomorrow. :X
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai UGH. Maybe if I'm off I'll come visit and then head to the park later for that day. So I can see you.
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai The only day I know for sure is closing day. I'm a slave to work now. x.x
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai So, now that we've all established that we're cool with this...I don't know where to take the conversation now. xD
@DeBaKai @satans_hellpopx See, Lori? I tolddd you.
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai Here's the problem - he very rarely gets annoyed...unless I'm stupid. THEN he'll get annoyed. #dingding
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai I KNOW. D: FML. #chrisforevertagged #lol #learnmylifestory #allthehashtags #yolo #swagswagswagonyou
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai I know it was Discovery. Cuz we sucked and didn't have the papers we needed and you were like, OHEY. ISUCKTOO.
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai I THINK IT'S FEBRUARY 24TH. OR SOMETHING. UGH.
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai I know we partly stopped because we wanted the day we met in it somewhere, BUT COULDNT REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS.
@DeBaKai @satans_hellpopx Shush. We wanted them forever ago and talked about it in....December of last year, I think? #butnomoney
@DeBaKai seriously is an understatement.
Now that I have money, @satans_hellpopx and I need to think about our sister tattoos we were talking about forever ago. &lt;3
@DeBaKai Is it tomorrow yet?
Not a fan of the fact my weekend is all messed up. :(
@DeBaKai Excuse me, but I don't like this tweet.
I never realized how impatient I am for things to move along until right now. #notsopatientlywaiting #ugh
@spikedudej -___-
@spikedudej NO. NOT OLAF.
This headache is beyondddd real right now.
@DeBaKai Ssshhhhhh lol
@DeBaKai It's cheaper than the place I used to buy it from. :X
Might or might not get an extremely extensive nail polish collection from work...
Sharing a bank account with someone is literally the most complicated thing ever. #marriedlife #almost #900000daystogo
@CharlesTrippy @Alliewess Omg you two are the absolute sweetest to each other. &lt;3 Take care of yourself Char and have fun Allie! &lt;3 &lt;3
A new Don't Hug Me I'm Scared is supposed to come out this month?! OMFG.
Even though my shifts are *kinda* short, I still dread the fact I work 6 days in a row starting tomorrow
@mrscook Agreeeed
@mrscook I'm not sure how I feel about this at all. :X
For some reason I just really want to go spend a weekend at a cabin with my favorite people and just not worry about anything. #soundsgood
@satans_hellpopx All of the feels!!
@satans_hellpopx I hear yaaaa. My excitement over my first paycheck is beyonddd real lol
@satans_hellpopx I know :(
My head hurts so bad right now. :( #needsnuggles #andanap
@satans_hellpopx I would just take 10,000 a month, if I could. I think I would be pretty content with that.
I'm way too awake for my own good.
@spikedudej Taco Bell.
@satans_hellpopx @RingPorns OMFG. I WANT IT
I'm making out like a bandit for my birthday. This is scary. <PARTY POPPER><CONFETTI BALL><BALLOON><PARTY POPPER>
@EdgarAllanBr0 Hope your night goes alright. I know people are extra stupid tonight. Looovvvveeeee you my scary child &lt;3 &lt;3
Nice to see Dead Man's Party with all of the special effects working. #happybirthdaytome
@satans_hellpopx @DeBaKai I just showed him that tweet and you should've seen his face lol
@satans_hellpopx LOL. @DeBaKai got super upset he wasn't included. He doesn't understand our love. :P <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<FACE THROWING A KISS><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE THROWING A KISS><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
i entered to win an IPHONE 6 prize pack from @shopzerogravity &amp; @grav3yardgirl :D 
That being said, I find the whole situation absolutely hysterical, love the huuugggeeee downgrade, and will now forever be happy with life:)
I cut those ties months ago. Trust me, I have no desire to go back to the abuse and his stalking is getting a little old.
I would love to know what my ex tells people that makes them think I talk to him? HE'S the one contacting ME. Not the other way around.
Laying on my bed literally half dressed. Oh. #birthdayweekend2014
@DeBaKai lol for once, I'm not.
@DeBaKai oh, good because I'll be at like, 12:45ish for an eta by the time I'm ready lol
@DeBaKai soooooo what time *should* I be up there? Lol
Soooo....I should take a shower now, right?
@DeBaKai Oh, good. You had a late start too. :P
Maybe I should get up now and take a shower....since I sure as hell didn't clean my room. #allovertheplace #oops #latestart
Anytime I'm up before 10 is way too early for me. X.x
I just want to stay home and watch Say Yes to the Dress all day.
Also should maaayyyybbbeeee clean my room at some point....maaaybee.
Omg. This cable. Like....slow your roll, damn it. Making me miss phone calls and the whatnot. UGH. HATE CALLING PLACES BACK.
I'm way too happy to not have the Oprah chai sleeve on my coffees from starbucks. Your advice wasn't needed, damn it.
If tonight is a thing, I might just like...omg. I don't even know.
@DeBaKai They haven't been releasing any of their college show dates, which is stupid as hell.
First I was just annoyed about tonight and now I'm just pissed off over people not listening to me.
@DeBaKai My frustration level over this is real....especially since them being here for my birthday was my birthday wish last year. #nolie
@DeBaKai I know. Doesn't mean I'm still not going to troll every possible avenue to try and go tonight...for $10 a ticket? Uhm. $worthit
@DeBaKai it's already sold out, but it's at tcnj at 7.
Me: currently. 
Literally, it's my birthday on Monday and all I want to do is see @WeTheKings tonight and they're an HOUR AWAY. Like...for real.
@mrscook and now it pisses me off because I can afford going to things now. Ugh.
@mrscook omfg. I basically hate them right now. Fuuucccckkkkkk this not knowing the college dates shit.
@mrscook OMFG. That's so effing close to me too
The irrational anger I just got over @WeTheKings being in the state is unreal. POST YOUR COLLEGE DATES DAMN IT.
@mrscook WTF. Where are they at tonight?!
@EdgarAllanBr0 in a community college, whether it's OCC or not. When you finish your two years you can transfer and get more scholarships!
@EdgarAllanBr0 Seriously though, start looking into scholarships now. They help sooo much. Plus if your grades are good enough, start off -c
@EdgarAllanBr0 Financial aid. AND SCHOLARSHIPS. GET GOOD GRADES!
I thought having a ribbon/flat charger for my phone meant maybe it wouldn't break as fast...
Haven't been this confused in months....
Well...so much for my good mood lasting...
The fact Ulta is literally carrying all of the products I love now is like....the best/worst thing ever. #byebyepaycheck
There's just way too much going on on my Twitter feed right now.
Christopher's tweets to me when I'm at work are a surefire way to make me happy/ugly cry when I'm done with my shift. #perfection
The irony over having super cold feet isn't lost on me in the least....
Having one of those laying on the floor wondering about life moments...
I have a love/hate relationship with the fact I can now say "I hate Monday."
@DeBaKai well that's always a huge plus lol
Happy happy happy. #cupcakesarelove 
The more I try to be cute, the more I fail at it today. Omg.
@DeBaKai lol congrats. :33
@DeBaKai lmfao well that's a good thing. If you didn't like it there would be a problem
@DeBaKai good to knooowwwww
@DeBaKai What's the weather like by you? Is it cold?
@DeBaKai I'll probably tell you later
@DeBaKai Just an observation that I made today. It's all good.
For someone who says they don't like me, you certainly do a lot of things to be like me....
Neeeeeeed more nail polish remover. The downsides to literally repainting my nails every other day.
My life is surrounded by people who talk to themselves. #itsconfusing #pleasestop
@DeBaKai Nothingg.
@DeBaKai Omg.
@DeBaKai To me it is.
@DeBaKai Because it is.
@DeBaKai But see....that's stupid.
@DeBaKai why would you even want me to do something like that,
@DeBaKai you can, maybe. But I can't.
@DeBaKai That's terrible....I couldn't do that.
@DeBaKai As all the photos/videos show up? Ha. Hahaha. Haaaaaaa.....
@DeBaKai As if I want to deal with you tomorrow if I do? Uhm. No thank you.
@DeBaKai UGH.
@DeBaKai Soooo......is a bajillion hour trip into Pennsylvania to see We The Kings better? :P
@DeBaKai :(
@DeBaKai But the park doesn't open until 5:30.... :( And I'm energetic today.
@DeBaKai Yuuusshhh.
@DeBaKai But whyyy? I wanted to redo my video from where I had showed you the better spot...while hoping it wouldn't be TOO busy.
@DeBaKai What would be stupid? Going by myself? Orrrrr going in general? lol
@DeBaKai Anythingggg is better than 6. But, ya know.
Debating on traveling out to the park tonight....but don't want to go alone. x.X
Well...guess sleeping in was until 9:30. Hardly think that counts.
Currently my only saving grace to keep me awake. #starbucks 
Slightly excited for Taco Bell as a snack right now. It's been too long #livemas
Ready for foooood. :X
It's ok...I didn't want to sleep until 8 or anything. Or, ya know....maybe sleep in general? <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
The irony of starting now is double points on anything I buy this month...cuz birthday.
Need to get used to the idea of waking up early for work...and today's only orientation. #tooearly #help #needmoresleep
My excitement level over the fact I'm finally going to have money again is slightly overshadowed by how much I need to pay on my credit card
It would be greaaaat if I didn't feel sick. :(
Not sure whether I want to laugh or cry over this weekend and the fact that FINALLY and hopefully after today things are going to be fine.
At what point does the shit end? Please. I would love to know. M
Officially the most aggravating and awkward weekend ever.
It's funny how everyone seems to forget who was actually there for them. Especially for the people who just showed up out of nowhere.
Officially done with the people I even bothered considering friends. There's only so much that someone can take with no apologies. Ever.
The sky's awake so I'm awake
By far the best razor I've ever used! Really good for super sensitive skin!! @GilletteVenus #ItsNotMe #contest
I mean....let's be real....this is highly accurate.... #colormatchyourbutthole
And my original tweet didn't go through so tweet number two makes no sense.
Holy shit. That's all you had to do the first fucking time.
Way way way way waaayyyyyy too early to be up on a Saturday. Hate when stupid events go on in town. <ANGRY FACE>
I like how I'm already trying to pick out my phone case for a phone that I'm not getting any time soon. x.X
My room is suuucchhhh a mess
Omg this is too damn funny. ‚Äú@BestProAdvice: Cool idea 

*sigh* :/
I really just want this right now. :( 
A few hours later and it still bothers me. Awesome.
I just want to go to bed, honestly.
You know those moments where you try reaaaaallllyyyy hard to act like something doesn't bother you? Yeah.
The Sims = 99% of the time building the perfect house &amp; 1% actually playing the game
It's very obvious I created a Wawa monster....
I hate finding cute ideas that I genuinely like but wouldn't make sense. X.x
@DeBaKai yes....yes it does
@DeBaKai we'll see is rightttt
Pretty sure the very idea of having pizza...again...makes me want to throw up. Sick of it.
@DeBaKai I'll be the one going hehe when I know what I'm talking about
@DeBaKai we've had this conversation before. It won't happen!
There is never going to be a time in my life where I consider soup to be "dinner."
15 hours to upload The Awakening and DMP from the other day. Omfg.
@EdgarAllanBr0 I hope you're feeling better today! &lt;3
It's going to take me like...900 years to edit this video...at least I kept photos to a minimum...I think.
@EdgarAllanBr0 Am I allowed a photo with you tomorrow? O___o I swear I won't take your shaker
I was ok with not getting the new iPhone right away...until the box envy hit me. I want to just open a new phone box something terrible
If I could just have a steady stream of coffee today, that would be wonderful... #tooearly
I am way too excited for this weekend to even think about sleeping. It's a problem.
@spikedudej likewise, Jason...likewise
After three years of knowing each other, it's apparent the only time @spikedudej and I like each other is during Fright Fest.
It's really not even 7, yet?
I enjoy when nothing works right. ._.
It's Fright Fest tweet time. ;) #alldressedup #with #nowheretogo
I really need to clean my room.... #eventually
You are super hot #SexyMan @debakai
Hello @debakai
Hey Siri is awesome
For the 4th day in a row a #Moto360 is up for grabs from @droid_life! Details - 
This...this is all entirely too overwhelming. :/
@KaiserCoaster it's really confusing to me lol
SwiftKey is the coolest thing ever but this swiping thing is weird
@DeBaKai didn't we go over the fact I apparently like it? Lol
I kinda want it....lol 
Already over today. Omfg.
I don't even look remotely cute. At all.
A third #Moto360 is up for grabs from @droid_life! Details - 
I would've assumed that because today's the official rollout of ios8 all of the apps would be doing their updates...but no.
Got to do another unboxing video! Check it out! 
Pretty sure I would be pretty content with shaving if I had a lifetime supply of @GilletteVenus s embrace sensitive! It's amazing! #itsnotme
The best things in life are free from @Influenster &amp; @GilletteVenus! #ItsNotMe
Timelapse videos are fun.
Currently trying to question why my villagers in #acnl are telling me I don't have enough plants...it's covered in flowers, damn it.
Trying to win another #Moto360 from @droid_life! Details - 
So much for this headache going away... :(
I'm going to win a #Moto360 from @droid_life! Details - 
iOS 8 actually kinda confuses me. Not sure how I feel about it.
I guess two days earlier is still better.
Taking the next hour to download the GM for ios8. Forgot that was a thing and could've had it a week ago.
One of those mornings where I really just would've liked to wake up next to Chris and make him wake up to snuggle with me. :(
All I did was joke about the power outage at Great Adventure when Chris and I got to the park
Chris bought me literally the coolest charging cable ever.
My philosophy is if you're buying a venti of anything at Starbucks, your day has been terrible.
I literally just need to get a Pumpkin Spice Latte at @Starbucks and just mellow out because this morning isn't working out right at all.
Knew I should've taken my shower last night....
Oh, no. It's ok. I wasn't planning on leaving in a half hour or anything when I know it'll take me that much time to take to get ready...
Laying on my floor, mid-packing, realizing that today will be a step towards a huge decision I made months ago. This is a little crazy.
Omg. My need/desire for coffee is intense.
Lori is forever and always going to be the best sister that isn't blood related.
Literally all of this shit could've waited for another weekend. Yay for another weekend ruined before it even started.
Seriously beyond sick of literally everyone right now.
Today is honestly beyond boring. The one time I want to talk to people and it's impossible to hold a conversation.
@spikedudej I hate you.
K.
Today's going to be one of those days...
I'm over today. Just had a spider crawl down my arm. How about no.
Lol preorder wouldn't come in for a month anyway. Whateverrrr.
At the rate I keep dropping my phone on the floor today I might have to crack and preorder the iPhone. -__-
I would like to maybe not be in so much pain right now. That would be wonderful.
I'm extremely confused by this going from nothing to all of a sudden having everything all at once. How does this work?
What...is going on?
I hate knowing I'm bothered by something, but not knowing how to explain it.
I need a vlog stick in my life.
Literally my favorite. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> ‚Äú@HowHeAsked: such a good proposal story - worth the read. 
@DeBaKai Lol, hold on, messaging youuuu.
@DeBaKai Saves a ton of money, too... almost thought it was something that wouldn't need to be purchased, buttt...not the case lol.
Reddit is quite literally my beyond favorite site. Someone's epiphany just saved me a ton of future stress. Perfect.
Everyone complaining about the iPhone 6 design doesn't realize it looks almost exactly like the original phone, but thinner.
This is really accurate. 
Ok...this is actually pretty funny. 
Since Apple and Disney work closely together, I almost guarantee the watch will work like the magic bands at some point. Calling it now.
I kinda like the heartbeat thing for the watch.... .____. That's awesome for long distance relationships.
At least the watch looks gorgeous.
@PhillyD But Phil, that's what the health app is to help prevent!
How long before Apple pay gets hacked into? I doubt the security of this in the long run. I don't see it being any more secure, but worse.
For the first time ever, I don't have the desire to immediately preorder the iPhone 6. I actually need to think about it...
Well, at least the price point of the phone is on track with any of the other releases the past few years.
Take a photo right nowwwww if you have such amazing noise reduction.
How are we only at an 8mp camera, Apple? I'm honestly becoming more disappointed.... :/
I just can't stand hearing "iPhone 6 Plus."
But....I don't think the battery life is that impressive still.
@KaiserCoaster Here's the thing, though....the rounded edges are a throwback to the original iPhone... Just noticed that. :(
@KaiserCoaster I know, but now it sucks because it's actually the real thing now lol
Now I'm slightly upset that the leak on Reddit is the actual iPhone.... The rounded edges need to go.
"Hey, guys...I just got the iPhone Plus. LOOK AT ME.
Well, at least the iPhone 6 isn't the iPhone air...but there IS the iPhone Plus...which sounds stupid.
I got Stuffed Crust Pizza! What Kind Of Pizza Should You Actually Be Eating Right Now? 
My budget is 15,000, but it's cool. Tell me the pricing starts at 24,000 anyway. -_-
Taking a nap was a terrible idea....I'm now even more tired than I was before (and in even more pain)
The amount of pain I'm in right now is unreal. Owwww.
This Pumpkin Spice Latte is absolute heaven right now.
I blame every stupid college kid who needed to "stock up" and buy the 20 boxes they won't need
Apparently every woman in Piscataway is on their period because there are quite literally no regular tampons. #whoneedssuper #ihateyouall
@DeBaKai What?
I'm not even going to bother fixing that typo
My car smells like it's sad all week and hasn't been run. -_-
It is way too early to be this damn hot. Ugh.
I just....I don't want to be up yet. T.T But here I am. Awake. Doing things. Fml.
I just totally feel like I shouldn't be up right now.
@mrscook Trust me, I'm just as bad. I talk about it A LOT in person.
@mrscook They need to do another show at Great Adventure like they did forever ago. Like...forever forever ago. x.x
@mrscook Oh holy shit. I need a WTK fix myself but that's a hell of a hike
@mrscook That's the stupidest shit ever. Screw them. Is there going to be another college show around there?
@mrscook They should be damn glad that people even want to travel there for the show. MAYBE THEY TURNED AWAY POTENTIAL STUDENTS #nobutstill
@mrscook Do I know said "people" or are they completely random? And that's the stupidest shit ever. WHY DOES ST JOES CARE SO MUCH?
@mrscook And they were like LOLNO U CANT GO, right?
@mrscook Should I assume your St Joes hate is because WTK had a show there tonight? lol
I enjoy watching all the lights in the backyard light up. :)
That's cuz it was peach. #knewit
I have never had pumpkin ice cream with chunks in it.... Pretty sure that wasn't even pumpkin. #nothappy
Got a blue Powerade and all I can taste is coconut even though there's none actually in it. -_-
Awkward moment when a lady buying a new bible gives a dirty look after looking at the penis book. #butits3d
Awkwardly looking at a book of penises in the book store with my mom. Literally...a book of penises. With 3d glasses.
Just realized that tomorrow is going to basically be the start of real life. Like this is a thing?
@mrscook One of these days. I've said it forever! Lmfao
I legitimately love reading @mrscook 's tweets at any given time. I still wish I could fave all of them without being a creep.
@EdgarAllanBr0 I'LL SIGN!
Am I the only one who actually thinks wedding vows that say the wife has to submit and obey her husband are complete and utter bs?
I literally hope that this is the answer to everything finally. It's been a long time coming.
@spikedudej @gadvonline Who's paying for me, then? Cuz I can't.
Since I'm not doing anything that isn't free, why would I pay? For real. ‚Äú@spikedudej: @gadvonline @caitography does‚Äù
Oh...alright, then lol. 
My face is so oily right now. I hate it.
Why does the job I applied to the other day have another job listing up? What?
I just entered to host a #BeautyBash! Find out how to get a #FREE @BenefitBeauty &amp; @Birchbox party in a box 
So, this is a thing. :P


Facebook has seriously been slacking with the amount of outages they've been having this year. Time for something new.
I love when Facebook dies
Regular butterflies...daily, but the super overly excited butterflies? That's a little intense.
What is this? Overly excited butterflies? Haven't had them in a while.
Dreams while the shark are present are bizarre as all hell.
Of course the vlog would only be half uploaded. That's wonderful.
Only plus side to the dentist today - a travel brush and travel toothpaste. I think I win the dentist prize game for being good today. :P

@DeBaKai I have a severe love/hate relationship with this right now.
@DeBaKai That would be correct. The irony, once again, isn't lost. At all.
I hope a shark emoji is in the emoji update...it's very much needed today.
@CharlesTrippy Happy birthday, Char! Have an awesome day and eat some pizza!! :D
@DeBaKai True
@DeBaKai possibly
@DeBaKai What else is new in my life anymore?
@DeBaKai It sounded like someone was throwing rocks at my window...but there was no one there. I don't know.
@DeBaKai Apparently I created a huge inconvenience for not buying a can of cat food so now she has to go grocery shopping... Wow.
It isn't even noon yet and I'm already getting yelled at. Yyaaaaayyyyy me. #getmeoutofhere
@DeBaKai So did I. Until I woke up at like whatever o'clock because I was hearing weird things. X.x
@DeBaKai &lt;_______________&lt;
@DeBaKai Ouch. D:
If you're really super awesome, you would follow @travisrclark and read his rad tweets. :)
@DeBaKai It's otay. It's been a loooong time since we've done that
I'm so aggravated with life right now.
Screw it. Editing it later. I think sitting at Starbucks for a little bit is in order again tonight.
Correction - get to cut out a chunk of the video and I guarantee Chris will complain about it. #dealwithit #illexplainlater #lololol
Currently sobbing over the fact that the vlog is going to take 900 years to export today. T.T First 15+ minute vlog in foreverrr.
As an FYI to myself and already on here. WHEN I HAVE JOB (in this order) - replace brake pads, get iMac fixed, buy new MacBook
Can I just maybe always wake up to things like this? Like literally just made my whole day. #love #perfect 
@train Really nice seeing you tonight in AC! Fourth show I've seen over the years and always phenomenal. :)
Ew. I don't think I ever want to go to a concert unless it's @WeTheKings because at least the fans are nice. Omfg.

I'm going to be that age that no one likes you at, according to Blink182, in a month and a half. Holy shit.

@DeBaKai You seem...surprised lol ;P
@DeBaKai Maaaayyyyybbeeeeeeee? Lol
This show I'm watching...wtf. Dating Naked? That's a thing? Hollyyy hell. The things people do for a chance at love. x.X
I'm going to create a new thing. It's no longer SOS - It's SOC: Send Out Chris. :(
Anddd I have a headache.
Andddd slowly starting to realize I'm getting depressed again. Cool.
Either 564 or 687. Weird.
Excuse me, but I want this. ‚Äú@pizzahut: Bacon and Cheese Stuffed Crust. Behold. 
My stress level right now is unreal. Holy hell.
Officially don't think today could be any worse....just stepped on a creepy ass bug that decided to crawl around on my toes. Why why why #ew
I find it extremely funny that after bringing my car to get serviced it starts to have a ton of problems
I'm the master of waiting last minute. Holy hell.
Actually feel like an adult paying bills myself...aaannnddddddd I'm broke again. #ohwell
Now officially want to do the Wishes Dessert Party.... Can I go like...now? Maybe? Please? #doallthethings
I enjoy Wednesdays so I can watch some more @seeyareelsoon ! Best start of my day ever.
This is an interesting article if you were an avid Neopets user - 
I've never mentioned I've wanted to do tie-dye to my mom and she just came home from work with two kits. How is that a thing?
The first dream I had last night sucked, but the second one was pretty good.
Is Swarm the new Foursquare?
China Telecom leaks the iPhone 6 on Weibo 
Nothing better than waking up and feeling like absolute shit. #paineverywhere
It's obvious that Chris is definitely my future husband since we both stopped to look at a lottery ticket on the ground to see it it won
My ability to remember just about anything is non-existant right now. Uhhmmm.
Who sleeps with square pillows? What?
Parking lot take 2. Omg
Roadway parking lots - the parkway edition.
Also clearly today is one of those days where I'll be getting a late start. -_-
I feel bad for people who think Florida is hot year-round. Most definitely not true....
I love editing the vlog to find out new things...excuse me, sir, but what sort of surprise are we talking about?
So, uh.....this little guy most definitely wasn't there last night..... 
Friday is forever. &lt;3
That moment when you see a store is hiring for a place you wanted to move to #lol #ofcourse
I want all the things right now.
And now this KFC commercial. Fml. I think I'm hungry
Aaandddd I smell garlic bread andddd I want it. #damnit
@TheRealPSL   
Are any of my followers on the Line app? Or play Disney TsumTsum?
iPhone 6 production disrupted as Apple abandons thinner backlight approach, reports Reuters 
This will absolutely be me in the future. 
@DeBaKai You don't. If you did believe me I would've pointed it out already.
A lot of truth in this - 
Also...apparently someone liked me enough to nominate me for that challenge thing... Why.
That was miserable....honestly.
Let's be honest....this job application I just filled out was the stupidest one ever.....and just got worse. -_-
I would loveee to know why my anxiety keeps kicking in...only went a few days without it. #yay
Starbucks Offers Pumpkin Spice Lattes Early, But There's a Twist - NBC News -

I seriously can't wait until I get to go to Disney with Chris. &lt;3 Currently watching Disney videos and imagining our future trip. :)
So, uhm...it's hot out.
Cleaning out e-mails is absolutely beautiful.
Is it the weekend yet?
Well....that was awkward and depressing to witness.
Aaannnddddd I'm already over this week. I will gladly take a one way ticket out of here.
Ooooowwwwwww....
@KaiserCoaster Oh, look. I'm everywhere and nowhere all at once.
"I'm not blowin no balloon animal." LMFAO
Actually any food while drunk &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Mac and cheese while drunk &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
oh my dear lord...it's already becoming difficult to type. Only two drinks in and it's hitting. #lightweight
Drinking, making dinner, and getting ready to watch a movie with my future husband. #lifeisgood
Is this kid asks me one more time if I need help.......so help me.
@travisrclark take Jenny to your favorite place that she's never been to! :)
I touched the butt. :)
@DeBaKai Lmfao &lt;3
"I'll only be 10-15 minutes!" *twelve hours later* &lt;3
I need to remember Chris's definition of time needs to be tripled. :)
I basically want to eat all the things. #truestory
For the life of me I honestly can't remember why I came into walmart....
I wasn't aware my hair cut was so drastic my regular service guy for my car didn't recognize me :X
@DeBaKai DAMN IT
@DeBaKai You make me insane sometimes lol
@DeBaKai Omg, Christopheeerrrrrr &gt;___&lt;
@DeBaKai Stooppppppp
@DeBaKai *sigh* so you bombard me on here. It's also how I know you're in a good mood. ;P
@DeBaKai I hate your logic sometimes lmfao
@DeBaKai lol why do you bother me on here and not on Facebook? Go away lol
@DeBaKai Holy shit. O___o lmfao
@DeBaKai shush.
@DeBaKai WHY
@DeBaKai UGH. I imagine I will at some point this weekend. Today is not that day lol
@DeBaKai yeah, yeah
@DeBaKai it will be when I win. :)
@DeBaKai Mehhh. It's k.
@DeBaKai HEY. Guess what? You're playing Jenga with me cuz I haven't played it in forever and I'm bringing it with me. Ok? Ok.
@DeBaKai omg leave me alone
@DeBaKai I don't want to stick it directly to my windshield though. X.x
Sometimes I'm not a smart person...just decided to repaint my nails when I still need to pack and do my makeup. -.- Hopefully it dries fast
@KaiserCoaster WHY WOULD I GO THERE?
@KaiserCoaster it's north to me
@KaiserCoaster Piscataway again
Today's gonna be a long day. -.- Haircut, oil change, have to stop at a few places, then the bajillion hour drive up north. T.T
Just realized I met @CharlesTrippy for the first time a year ago on the 18th. A lot's changed in a year for all of us. Crazy.



Annnddddd I get to leave the house ridiculously early tomorrow. Oh the joy.
My annoyance level right now is through the roof. I don't want to be home. At all.
Well that took .3 seconds for my somewhat ok mood to go completely to shit
That moment when you realize you made something for someone that you really like and don't want to give it to them... #artistproblems
I need The Sims 4 in my life... #sorrynotsorry
Finally editing the vlog and all I want to do is pet Chris's beard because it looks super soft. #ilikeit

Whoever is on the marketing team for @Starbucks is an absolute genius. Best way to find out the #pumpkinspicelatte will be out super soon :)
@TheRealPSL You're officially my favorite account. #iloveyou
Playing Jenga by yourself isn't fun. :(
Maybe not. I don't know.
Meh. Cheaper to buy a new MacBook instead of doing a full rebuild like I would want to do. #ohwell
Let's just add my MacBook to the list of things that need to be fixed...since it's not in warranty might as well upgrade parts, right?
I can't figure out if she's pawning me off or she just really likes Chris. I think it's both reasons, but which is the bigger reason? #QOTD
It's official. My mother is trying to pawn me off since she just asked why Chris didn't ask to marry me when he was here... #sheknows
Starting to feel like maybe I've always been the crazy one.
I literally have no idea what to do with life when I'm not with Chris. :(
All...I can smell...is coconut. Why.
"Where this moon be?" "In the sky." -receive evil glare-
True story - I regret not taking Spanish in high school and college now.
Chris goes and gets a bag of pretzels...starts eating them. Gets to the last pretzel - "Oh...did you want any?" Thanks, babe. Thanks.
Starbucks. Desperately. Needed. #tired
Andddd this is back. Perfect 
Also my car hates me after sitting for a week and a half. O___o
I'm scared. I finally figured out how to pack for weekends....only 3 1/2 months later.
I'm having way too much fun watching old vlogs right now.
Why would you ask me my opinion if you're just going to tell me I'm basically wrong? #wellthen
I feel like I should have like a dinner with everyone going to Panic tonight since y'all are like a half hour away from my house.
MacBook, can we maybe noootttt keep joining the wrong wifi network? That would be greaaat.
Well...with that  (not-so) lovely piece of information it's time to move along with my day...
That awkward moment you find out you're very indirectly related to someone you wouldn't want to be related to even if it's through marriage
Really? Again with the nightmares? :(
Is Your Girlfriend Crazy?: 
This is a joke, right? 
Wooowww I feel so sick today. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Uhhh...yeah...so...totally messed up the one thing I was making... It will never see the light of day lmfao.
I mean I'm all for the philosophy when you know then you know, but for only knowing each other for maybe a week before you got together? #no
I thought people getting engaged after knowing each other for two months was crazy...someone on my friends list got engaged after 3 weeks
Sinus headache....how wonderful.
@nerdrockjosh Definitely not worth getting worked up over stupid shit. The people who've met you know you're chill as hell. Trueeee story.
Everything is moving sooooo slow today. It's going to take beyond forever to get this video uploaded...I can tell.
Getting dizzy from how much Chris walks around while he's vlogging. x.X
Whoaaaa headache.
Is it seriously only Tuesday? I want the weekend now. :(
@ADDisn3y Damn straight.
@ADDisn3y I'm sorry. I can make fake drama for you?
Why is Facebook so drama filled today? Wooow.
@Starbucks Mysterious person(s?) who run this account, you're fantastic. Thank you for the update! :)
Despite all the stupid shit....I really am the lucky one.
I'm extremely fortunate in not having to learn that the grass isn't always greener on the other side...I just wish I knew how to help.
@mrscook I'm jealous of your life
Now begins the debate on whether I  feel like re-piercing my ear tonight. Forgot how much I actually liked having multiple ear piercings.
Quiet...that's how today is going to go.
Debating over these texts...I still don't know who the hell is the wrong/right one.
Currently wondering how today's going to go...
@spikedudej @fuzzy00001 @KaiserCoaster Honestly, I don't even know...but I have video of it.
I have video of @spikedudej @fuzzy00001 and @KaiserCoaster doing "I'm a Little Teapot." I don't remember this being a thing...
Not sure what was worse...my eyeliner or my eyeshadow....
Remember those times I thought I could do a smokey eye and do it the right way?
Officially give up on this sleep thing if it's just going to be one nightmare after another....
Again with the nightmares? Really?
Nothing like waking up crying from a nightmare....
The absolute last thing I ever needed was to feel like that again...not a fan of this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.
Just a little excited for the snuggles that are sure to happen later on. :)
@DeBaKai shush damn it lol
@DeBaKai unless you're referring to every other beta I've done? Lol
@DeBaKai I tried it once!!!
@DeBaKai I MADE ONE DUMB MISTAKE! I did all of the ios7 beta!!
@DeBaKai It's iOS 8 that will be the deciding factor...duh. Which I could try now......but I won't. :x or will I? I don't know.
@DeBaKai it comes out the day after my birthday lol. It's a sign~
Uhhhh....birthday present, please? That would be wonderful. Thank you, come again. 
Or not.
Going to bed....
The struggle is beyond real.....
Currently giggling at the original thumbnail for the latest video that YouTube picked. By far the derpiest face ever. :P
This....worst thing ever. True story - the one time this happened to me I cried because I didn't know what to do. #no 
Clearly today is just going to be one of those ridiculously sucky days. :/
Laundrylaundrylaundry. #notfun
Apparently I also have a collection....@DeBaKai 
It's only taken me forever, but I finally found the Amazon gift card @spikedudej sent for #bestesttweetsawards
Omg...all of these photos. Absolutely precious - 
@Starbucks No problem! :) I'll just keep a look out, then!
@Starbucks Thank you! &lt;3
The smell of rain is delicious. &lt;3
@DeAnnKelly12 The addiction is beyond real. :P
@Starbucks Slight problem with trying to redeem - it directs me to the online Starbucks store. Help? I've been dieing to try the tea! :(
@Starbucks I...I love you. Thank you! &lt;3 Will definitely be trying later on! :) #inlove
Kindaaaa want to try the blackberry mojito tea from Starbucks at some point.
Award for most obnoxious ring I own goes to this guy. Literally have never worn it before and didn't know I had it. 
Facebook....what in the ever living hell is wrong with you today?
Holy hell...another two hours until the video is finally uploaded. T.T
I shouuulldddd finish up the last bit of cleaning I need to do, but eeehhhhh. My room's only going to get messy again from laundry.
chase, I love you and all, but when I sign up for paperless that seriously means don't send shit to my house. Thanks.
Andddd now my constant tweeting is done now that Facebook has finally returned. #magic
Oh...well, this is new. My mom is now laying on the floor pondering life. I guess that's who I get that particular habit from.
Oh my dear lord. YouTube, can you not keep resetting which channel is my main channel? Almost uploaded to the wrong channel. #no #damnit
Thought I would be productive with Facebook being down, but turns out I spend more time refreshing the page than doing anything else. #oops
@DeBaKai Trueee storyyy.
@DeBaKai Wellllll...considering off they're both run off the same servers since Facebook owns Instagram now........ lol
@DeBaKai Yeah, Facebook decided to die. Some of the tweets people are writing are great lol
Currently giggling over the #facebookdown tweets
Facebook, can you maybe not while I'm trying to have a conversation? Thanks.
Why in the hell is there another rattling piece in my phone? I had my last one replaced for the same reason. #notamused #getyourshittogether
@DeBaKai Alright, alright. I'll give you that
@DeBaKai Excuse me, but that doesn't sound reassuring when you get to play with my iMac, the HP, AND the interwebz on Sunday. #allthethings
Literally just took out a minute worth of video just from Chris saying, "uhm." What.
Why do I still feel like absolute shit?
Groups of teenage girls bother me.
I can't not walk into an Ulta. No shame.
Well....wasn't a fan of that dream in the least... Yay for the massive headache I currently have, now. :(
Nothing makes me happier than getting to see Chris in the middle of the week. I'm super excited &lt;3
@mrscook Like...1 in the afternoon, duh. #noshame
Omg my closet is so clean. I'm scared. Is this even my room?
It's sad that based off of an actual wage calculator, between two people at min. wage at 40 hours a week doesn't even hit 30k a year. #wtf
Based off of calculations, living on your own in NJ is literally impossible with minimum wage. Holy shit.
I think it's kinda bad that something Build a Bear related just made me happy. #imfive #getoverit
It's getting reaaalllyyy difficult to not completely lose it.
Oooor not. Still doing the same thing. /sigh
Day 3 of iMac troubleshooting. Getting highly depressed. I want to do thinggsssss.
Dance Moms &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
Nice to know my freshman and sophomore year of high school exist in blog form...holy shit.
Lol at the time I got yelled at by my "friend's" mom and was banned from ever going back to her house ever again. Good times.
Once upon a time, I was weird and bought a diary...where the only thing written was login information for a livejournal. What is this shit?
Omg. I just really don't want to put any of this stuff back in my closet now....but my bed is covered so I can't take a nap. :(
I just took literally everything out of my closet....and now I don't want to reorganize any of it and put it back in my closet.
I should point out that this isn't even everything from my closet that's pulled out yet.... 
My closet is a treasure trove of LIES.
Waaaaaahhhh. :( 
So...I didn't change much between 8th grade and my senior year....or to now. That's cool, I guess. 
In need of strong liquor. #sendoutalcohol
I need to reorganize my room again.
Uhhh...yeah...apparently cleaning my closet was highly needed.
Well...guess I'm cleaning all day today even though I don't have to until the weekend....
Is there any particular reason all of this is happening all at the same time? Ooorrrrrr-?
Is this real life? Now my HP doesn't work again. Why.
Is this real life? Lol 
I should just always use my mouse for my MacBook...makes everything go a lot faster.
Well...nice to know I have a really expensive paperweight.
Sitting and trying to troubleshoot my Mac was not what I wanted to do. At all
Annnddddd now my Mac won't even boot up. Really?
Seriously not understanding why my Mac isn't even remotely doing anything it's supposed to.
I get way too many wedding related emails/things in the mail. #stopit
Beyond over today. Beeeyyyooonnnddd.
This is the first time I've ever been genuinely afraid with the weather. Not a fan of this thunder at all with how loud it is.
@DeBaKai can you like...not? Maybe? :)
I also love that no pairs of pants I own fit me right except for yoga pants right now. #damnit
Excuse me as I just find things to kinda just lie on...yeaaaaah. #cramps
My functionality level is officially at 0. This is going to be a wonderful weekend. #stayawake #pain #fml
This...this is not fun. Not fun at all.
That would currently be me...Nice to know that just cleaning my room made me hella dizzy SINCE I CAN'T BREATHE. #fml #torture #notacold
You know how like...you think you really need something? and then once you get it you realize you really don't want it for reasons?
The squirrel moments I'm currently having are pretty real. Damn it. I'm not productive in any form this morning.
Of course I would wake up a half hour before I need to leave with absolutely nothing done. Ugh.
I really want wine.
These cramps....are...terrible.
@KaiserCoaster Nopee. Not in Freehold right now.
@KaiserCoaster Noopppeeeeeeee.
I didn't look at my phone for an hour and had 23 notifications.... Why.
Puppy bellies are seriously the absolute best.
Spending the next who knows how long on 
I hate when I try to tell my mom something and she keeps like...disappearing.
I have a slight problem with being able to focus on one thing today. It's just not going to happen no matter how hard I try.
Now courtesy of my dream it's WDW videos all day. The Kiss Goodnight is probably one of the best things at the end of the night at MK.
@ChrisTheParty I may or may not be slightly obsessed with that song as well...BUT ONLY THE ORIGINAL VERSION.
Hmm...today's going to be fun, isn't it?
Had a dream that I was going to Disney again. Woke up upset that I wasn't actually there. T.T
26 Things Only Former Emo Kids Will Understand 
I feel like I'm one of the only few people who can forget to eat. I'm so hungry right now. &gt;_&lt;
Firefox hasn't been working correctly on my Mac for like...two weeks. It finally decided to work right again... #wtf
Omg. Chris has Instagram now. Help.
Nice to know my friends and I can currently go down memory lane with tonight. #familybonding
@satans_hellpopx But we have fun, so who cares? Lol
Our only concerns..... 
It gets worse..... 
I need moss at my future wedding. Already know how to fit it in to the decor. Damn it.

Oh my dear lord. I'm giggling so much. 
Got  @satans_hellpopx started on The Sims again. :3 #awesome
@satans_hellpopx YES. YAYYYYYY!! SUCH EXCITE
@satans_hellpopx Very truueeee
@satans_hellpopx to say i'm excited is an understatement. &lt;3
This always worries me....never know if she's serious or if she's being sarcastic. 
Omfg. Please tell me @satans_hellpopx is returning to Twitter.
Omggggg Dance Moms comes back on on Tuesday. Life made. &lt;3
Soooo glad my mom's decided that she's going to get my cat all her shots and spayed for me. So glad she's officially mine finally. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
