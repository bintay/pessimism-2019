@Louis_Tomlinson Thanks for YOUR support. Sorry things are shit right now. Know we'll always have your back. BIG LOVE sent your way.
Part of me hopes Harry gets that we're a lil sad still from yesterday and wanted to bring up a happy memory for us. #chocolatecoinproblems
@zaynmalik there are surely people who say they will stand by you for a long time, but PLEASE reflect on everyone's possible intentions.
@zaynmalik hey. You're a nice guy, we know. Just. Please make smarter decisions about where your loyalties lie. You're better than this.
I honestly feel so bad for all the boys of One Direction. Breakups are never fun or easy. I'm sorry people were hurt. Sending lots of love<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I don't think his tweet was aimed at Z, it was aimed at NB. Louis is fiercely loyal and protective of those he loves 
@Louis_Tomlinson Hey hope you're ok. For the record, your voice is lovely and unique. You're talented. Don't take those comments to heart <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Liz is like the snest(snail best), just so everyone knows.
Niall is out here tweeting about lifetime movies and memes. What have we done to deserve this?
@Louis_Tomlinson Do you get to see the new Avengers flick this weekend?!
Seems like an accurate reaction, @Harry_Styles  #oldfart

About Liz. Honestly.  
Listen. @fizfizfiz is a badass chick. It would be brill to have her as a sister. @Louis_Tomlinson you're a lucky one. #feminists
Just seeing a lot of smack talk about my friend's story because she doesn't value writing smut and focuses on her plot instead. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Like, 90% of published novels aren't smutty and we still read and value those. I'm just. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Like, a good story is a good story regardless.
I will never understand people who refuse to read fic because of a lack of smut.
@MrsAnneTwist you did so well with him, Anne. H is such a gift. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è

I love our boys and I enjoy their music, but goddamn, I am I sick of being purposefully mislead and lied to.
@6thalliancemgmt I just think the people donating (investors) deserve a formal written business plan before expecting them to give any money
@6thalliancemgmt I think your idea is pure-hearted and lovely, but I think you may be very much in over your heads here.
@6thalliancemgmt So will you host a forum on your website for fan input? Who will monitor social media for fan interaction?
@6thalliancemgmt If this crowdfunding is a success, what is your formal business plan for the following year? Will all investors see it?
@Real_Liam_Payne You look like a you're about to take a ride on daddy's yacht. ITS SO PREPPY WHAT IS THIS.
@Harry_Styles this felt like a much needed hug. Thanks, hazzabear.
@zaynmalik You had such a good run, buddy. Thanks for sacrificing as much as you did. Be well, and wishing you the absolute best. Xx
