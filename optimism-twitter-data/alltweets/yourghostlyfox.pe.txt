@raymondporter but what if they give up on you?
@sampepper legit feel sorry for the girl you raped. You can't just go around raping people. #oops
@BriBryOnTour why does Sam still make videos? And why are people still supporting him? I haven't stopped being upset about this.
I think it's a nice thing. Unless Sam Pepper wrote …
@kickthepj I do! One of my favorites!
It's not gay if you're best friends
2015 and still emo
@johnnyhanel it's okay, their opinion doesn't matter because their eyebrows are terrible
I remember 1 time my friend and I were chillin and this dude kept flirting with me and she str8 up kissed me and he walked away it was great
The day that I eat sushi in the bathtub is the day I'll truly be happy

I feel so bad for Matt, he doesn't deserve any of this shit. People need to learn how to take a joke.
@MattG124 We're all dicks. The people who don't know they're dicks? They're not dicks. They're chodes. That's worse.
@dearghostlyfox look up "emo haircuts" and you'll know what a fringe is.
"If you don't think you're a dick, it's 'cause you're a dick. And you don't know that." - @MattG124
