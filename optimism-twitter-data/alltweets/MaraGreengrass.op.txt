@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne I did mention this is my ONE AND ONLY OTP, right? ;) Like I can't be totally rational and stuff.
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne He comes back. He *does*. Whether Ichijo hugs him or punches him is up for debate, but he comes back.
@Revieloutionne @kitaokaapologst Exactly! But he will come back eventually because that's what he does.
@Revieloutionne @kitaokaapologst I think I see Godai as a cat. He brings back Grongi bits to please his husband. Grongi bits and food.
Ugh. You can tell it's humid around here because my hair still hasn't dried. I know I showered late in the morning, but really now.
@kitaokaapologst My reaction during that ep was more or less "OMG HE STOLE HIS BOYFRIEND A MOTORCYCLE!!!ELEVENTY!!"
@kitaokaapologst Because they are the most married pair ever. ::flails:: I am literally unable to imagine them not married.
@kitaokaapologst ::happy sigh:: They so are. It's weird after so many years in fandom to have an actual OTP :D
@kitaokaapologst much time thinking about them and food. But I just can't resist Godai feeding Ichijo (or Gorou feeding Kitaoka).
@kitaokaapologst of himself that Ichijo eats his half without complaining, even though it's really too sweet for him. I may have spent too-
@kitaokaapologst In my case, Godai bought the ice cream from an out-of-the-way stall and brought it half-melted to Ichijo. He's so proud-
@mizzelle @tsb_says Ha!
@mizzelle @tsb_says ::snerk:: :D
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says ::sporfle:: He so would. He's got a 3-D diagram that he used to figure out how to do it. Nobody asks to see it.
@tsb_says Pretty much the only person who gets the joke is him and usually River. But that's enough for him.
@tsb_says He totally does, you know. He puts obscene typos into articles by people doesn't like. I mean, obscene in obscure languages.
@tsb_says It sounds like something the Doctor does when he wants to play a prank, goes back in time to create a vol. 0 :D
Listening to Rachel Maddow talk about Oregon GOP killing the successful IUD program and I'm so mad I'm actually crying. KILLMAIMDESTROY.
@Revieloutionne -be just about anything ;) Not really inspired to do anything other than drool over George yet. But there's plenty of time.
@Revieloutionne ::snerk:: The coffee. Yes. I'm only a few eps in, so I have no serious ship opinions. But it's me, so if I write, it could-
@ultrasandriders They're all just so cute and dorky :) I haven't watched enough to have any serious ships.
Watching Mebius and as usual I ship everyone/everyone. What an adorable bunch of excitable dorks. Just got to "George learns how to team".
@kitaokaapologst I think I'll watch Agito next, but it's going to be a bit because I have to finish Hibiki and Gaoranger.
Alas, OT will not be subbing the Hero Next movies :( I was sort of hoping they would. Ah well. ::philosophical shrug::
@Revieloutionne I nearly always get complimented on the parts of a story that just...happened, rather than the ones I slaved over.
This is the dictionary definition of "irony", yes? Also, the Platonic ideal of schadenfreude. 
That poor woman who had to go back to work and leave her preemie in the hospital. I feel her pain. :( 
@trollprincess I'm going with "Bwahahahahahahahahaha! Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow :D" Because I'm a bad person :)
@arrowned Ugh. One of my coworkers hadn't made it out of Virginia after a few hours, so he turned around and went home to have lunch :(
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Is *that* what the kids are calling it these days? Now I know.
@UPPastryPlate Some people read the bible. I prefer to check in with Big Bird and Grover. I think I get superior advice on how to behave.
@UPPastryPlate Sesame Street remains the best source for parody outside of the Onion and the best source for ethical guidance period.
@Revieloutionne @LowVisibility Right. I want to be able to have the Watsonian AND the Doylist discussions. Or else why bother?
@RiderJetfire The dolphin was SO AWESOME. Loved that :)
@LowVisibility @Revieloutionne ::nods:: Sure, and if I'd loved any character in Gaim, I might have stuck with it. But they all bored me.
@Revieloutionne We can fix bad plot with fic but not theme/characters. (Well, we can fix them too, but it's more difficult, maybe?)
@Revieloutionne But I don't care how good the plot is if I find the theme &amp; characters irksome. I wonder if this is a fic writer thing?
@Revieloutionne I'm tolerant of mediocre/bad plot if I love the characters. Which is why I suffered through Kiva but abandoned Gaim.
@RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel That's still one of the most insane parenting choices I've seen in toku. And that's saying a lot, yo.
@WatcherMark It's why I'm less interested in cons with actor guests. I have a strong embarrassment squick that's set off by awful questions!
@WatcherMark I was at the first con a Stargate Atlantis actress attended. At autograph signing time, I apologized for my fellow fans. Sigh.
@tptigger42 I never assume everyone has one, but in certain positions? Especially when I know a show would give a *man* a PhD? Yeah.
@justshai I'm sorry :( That's a sucky feeling.
@aaronecarroll Darn it, I can't stand coffee. Can we go back to the chocolate is good for you thing? Because I like my daily hot cocoa.
@kitaokaapologst It's such adorable facial hair :)
@kitaokaapologst I like facial hair on men. I'm just sayin'. I like it a lot.
@tptigger42 I knew I'd never be PI for an excavation and wouldn't run a museum department unless I moved someplace very rural. My choice.
@tptigger42 not having a PhD. I have an MA and would rather die than go for a PhD :D But I knew I was losing certain opportunities.
@tptigger42 That's true, yes. But in our society, to get to the position she's in and do the things she's doing you *do*. Nothing wrong with
@RiderJetfire Okay, I was apparently in my early 20s? But honestly, I was immature enough at 20 that it's not that much different :D
@tptigger42 Apparently I can't do math after 10 pm, but I swear, I thought I was younger when it was on :D Yeah, I must've been 20ish!
@plutoHimself I absolutely buy this explanation. I wish I found it implausible, but...
@Revieloutionne I can't even. Why am I trying to get Yael interested in comics/toku/etc. when it's just going to lead to heartache?
Screw it, I refuse to waste time in this fic explaining why Angela Fairweather is Dr. instead of Ms. Because she IS, THAT'S WHY. Hmmph.
@RiderJetfire But for the 12-13 year old I was when it was on, it was absolutely perfect (until it went grimdark). My love was pure.
@RiderJetfire I loved that show SO MUCH. Holy moley. Those early optimistic seasons were like everything I loved about Star Trek.
@TerrierLee_ Oh no :( Ugh, it really sucks to be somewhere where they treat you badly :(
@TerrierLee_ What??? What happened?
@kitaokaapologst Yeah, pretty sure I've read that fic. And I never ever finished watching the show :D
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 This long story, however, is funny, unlike the 2nd baby shower one, which makes me homicidal even 6 years later.
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 We had booze, BBQ chicken, and folks hanging out. My bridesmaids were elsewhere, amusingly. Another long story.
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 I would have had one if I'd been living on the right coast at the time. We had a BBQ the night b4 the wedding tho
@Rivulet027 I had no wedding shower. First baby shower I said minimal stupid games. Second baby shower I refused to attend. (Long story.)
@tptigger42 I didn't :D I have to figure out when this story takes place and I'm completely mixed up on timelines. Whoops?
Aha! Picked my prompt for PR awesome women challenge and wrote a big chunk. It's mostly dialogue right now, but still...yay!
@Rivulet027 Oh gods, the superstitions around wedding and baby showers are seriously weird.
@pockysquirrel @RiderJetfire I second this. Therapy saved my life several times and is about 80% of the reason I'm halfway functional.
@Rivulet027 Ugh, I'm sorry :( ::hugs from afar::
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 Sorry, just irked that at some point my darling boy who's happy to wear pink shoes is going to be brainwashed.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 Well, that explains it. The penis only falls off if *little boys* wear a shirt with Black Widow. ::snort::
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 Wait, is that...Black Widow??? How did that sneak through? I thought someone was making sure that didn't happen ;)
@tsb_says Yup. In high school it was a meh song. Then I fell in love and HOLY MOLEY WHAT A GREAT SONG!!!
@tsb_says Do not send the man a shirt! His shirtless selfies are the only thing keeping me sane :D
@WatcherMark I'm sorry, have you *met* the Internet? ::facepalm::
@ShelbyWhite @Revieloutionne Oh. My. Unspecified Deity. That's simultaneously beautiful and horrifying.
@Rivulet027 @MorbySa @The2ndBatgirl @RiderJetfire We could test it? All stand in place and yell "Did you know that in Japan...?"
@MorbySa @Rivulet027 @The2ndBatgirl I wanna be Goushi! Although I'm the shortest, but I *am* the mommy. Hmm.
@aaronecarroll I used to work at a corner like that. Once we witnessed 2 in 1 day. Had to call 911 for the woman not wearing a seatbelt
@kausikdatta22 Ayup. Lots of 'em. Do I need to block them or anything or are they basically harmless and looking for attention?
@madgeofhonor @trollprincess Ugh, it's one of those articles written by a kid who thinks their generation invented genderqueer, isn't it?
@tsb_says That's my motto. Right after "Ain't nobody got time for that."
Wait...do you mean the Abandoned Warehouse Districts in Kamen Rider and Super Sentai are REAL? How dreadful. 
@tsb_says @MorbySa I've seen the Ben Vereen DVD a lot. Oddly, I don't own it.
@tsb_says @MorbySa So jealous! I haven't seen a live performance since high school!
@pockysquirrel @tsb_says @MorbySa Wait, haven't I written that? ::checks:: Huh, I guess not ;)
@MorbySa @tsb_says characters, but I never really got engaged with the story much. I like it better than Wild Force, though :D
@MorbySa @tsb_says Oh absolutely! Which is why I found her not being Red so irritating. I don't *dislike* the season but...eh. I like the-
@tsb_says @MorbySa For the record, at our wedding, Avi and I did our first dance to "Love Song" from Pippin. Seriously. ::happy sigh::
@tsb_says There is no help for ending there. Wah!!!
@tsb_says @MorbySa I love Jen a whole lot, but I have to admit that I didn't love Time Force. If Jen was Red and Wes &amp; Eric had kissed...
@MorbySa @tsb_says :D Congratulations on your excellent taste!
@tsb_says OMG, are you a Pippin fan too??? If @MorbySa wasn't already marrying you, I might have proposed ;)
@CarolinePruett @jason1749 @TheOtherJeff I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this. "Who the hell lets artifacts lie around like that???"
@The2ndBatgirl That would be very helpful. I might even be smart enough to listen to warnings now :)
@kitaokaapologst ::big hugs:: Hi, I've got panic disorder, social anxiety, and postpartum PTSD. So yeah, I'm kind of a regular mess too.
@WatcherMark Alas, I've been there, done that, and painted the spare bedroom. Why do Americans vote for the GOP? Ugh.
@WatcherMark I'm sorry to hear that :( It's a horrible feeling to see one's country make bad decisions.
@plutoHimself @Revieloutionne What is Kamen Rider if not a whole series about insane conspiracies and war profiteering? :D
@plutoHimself @Revieloutionne I'll bet there are special interests that don't *want* it cleaned up. Where would villains hide?
@kitaokaapologst Inorite? I'd really like to know the context there :)
I've just wasted an hour trying to fix e-mail on my phone and I missed a meeting b/c I didn't hear Avi say he was going out. I'ma cry now.
@Revieloutionne Well. My days of not taking Jeb seriously have certainly come to a middle. o_O
@pockysquirrel I...would hope so? o_O
@Revieloutionne Well, you never know what might be lying around in the Abandoned Warehouse District.
@Revieloutionne ::snickers madly:: Oh, I needed that pun right now. I was just getting really cranky, but now I'm laughing :)
Dear person who created this "recordkeeping log": 

Learn how to use tables. Or tabs. Or anything. 

No love, 
the mommy recreating your log
Oh, this too. I'm pretty demanding, come to think of it. 
Oooh, can I have this for Mother's Day too? It sounds like an ideal present to me. 
Good listening: Dr. Susan Blackmore on memes and consciousness and skepticism. She's so awesome :) 
Hooray! That's awesome! 
@RiderJetfire Ugh. People are stupid. That's all I've got, alas.
@arensb @dannyrios72 Yeah, I have that problem too. I always try to say "Washington, DC" for that reason :)
Oh man, the #AtheistsHaveNoMorals hashtag is TOO MUCH FUN, people. Make me stop! I could do this all day :) No, really. All day.
@dannyrios72 Oh my unspecified deity! I do that too. (I'm from the Washington DC suburbs, really.) We're horrible. #AtheistsHaveNoMorals
I help people no matter their race/ethnicity/religion. And I don't try to convert them to atheism while I'm doing it #AtheistsHaveNoMorals
Sometimes I don't help the PTA because I'm too busy with work, volunteering for the local civic association, my family #AtheistsHaveNoMorals
Sometimes when my kids are talking, I'm only pretending to listen. #AtheistsHaveNoMorals
Daddy and Barak are making macaroni and cheese. Which is srs bsns around these parts. (No school for kindergarten today.)
@mizzelle Well screw 'em. Clearly they should have just been born with proper hearing or to wealthy parents, right?
@Revieloutionne I could definitely go with that, from what I've read. They sound like the kind of folks the Tea Party would love.
@mizzelle This is why "I can't even" was invented. I can't even with the kind of person who'd say "eh, why would kids need to hear?"
@jamiekilstein Me too! And my parents were certain I would never do injectable drugs because I scream at the sight of needles.
Kids' hearing aids called cosmetic. How to describe this... Cruel? Stupid? Short-sighted? Evil? All of the above? 
@aaronecarroll Kids' hearing aids as cosmetic? I'm not sure English contains words strong enough to properly show my anger at that.
@mizzelle Yeah. My misreading wasn't *entirely* inaccurate. Possibly a Freudian slip in my brain.
Today's misreading of a headline...I saw "Britain's election could trigger political scum." (Oh, "a political scrum", yes, I see.)
@kitaokaapologst Good luck!
@tptigger42 @arrowned Yes to both.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who feels that way about those disgusting things. 
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says The ENTIRE CAST is trying to kill us. But kill us with looooove.
@kitaokaapologst I could buy an interpretation that his adoration isn't sexual but "friend" is much too mild a term.
@kitaokaapologst Bwahahahahahaha! That's so adorable :) sex aside, he worships the man!
Current theory: The search engine is trying to drive me insane. It fits the available evidence, I tell you.
@tsb_says I can believe that. Wow. Just wow.
@tsb_says Holy fuck, that's pretty much #1 on the "YOU ASSHOLE, DON'T DO THIS" list. Wow.
@tsb_says Oh good. ::facepalm:: I'm sure that's helpful to everyone :(
@tsb_says @MorbySa I love Abaranger so much for the awesome parenting. Also Not!Kira is a techie. (At least when they remember...)
@MorbySa OMG, that episode never stops being funny. I can't remember, have you seen Abaranger yet? 'Cause then it's even funnier!
@The2ndBatgirl @MorbySa If only the show hadn't squandered so many opportunities to have him be an awesome mentor!
@MorbySa Why are unmorphed fights so awesome? They're utterly stupid if you think about it, but I scream with glee Every. Single. Time.
@The2ndBatgirl I forget what I offered. I won't be super upset if I don't get matched with a PR person, though. For remix, it's okay.
@tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl @BrennanMejia @Yoshistunts Thirded! #yoshiforshang #brennanforaladdin
@The2ndBatgirl I've already forgotten what I included. Kamen Rider Series. Gokaiger maybe? PR Samurai? Plus some big fandoms like DC comics.
@tptigger42 ::laughs:: It absolutely was and I can't wait to write one for you :)
@The2ndBatgirl Yeah, I just signed up for remix. I'm consoling myself with the fact those usually go very fast for me.
@The2ndBatgirl There are a lot that aren't my story, but definitely one or two look like fun. Maybe when I'm done with some other stuff?
@tsb_says I'm flattered :) When I finish, somebody poke me to look at the other prompts and see if I can write a treat. It could happen.
Although I'm amused that this is the second time a PR challenge organizer has assigned me as their writer ::snerk::
::stares:: Holy moley, I could write any of my Awesome Women of PR requests. Ack! How to decide? A dartboard may be involved ;)
@macpuffins I got the sleep. Mostly. What I need is a little more sanity.
@justshai Mostly naked Yoshi is most of what's keeping me sane right now :D
@justshai I don't have time in my schedule for a nervous breakdown right now. Maybe next Thursday? And I lived w/my parents. And my in-laws.
I mean, I *could* decide to have my nervous breakdown now. Or I could go to sleep. I suppose the latter choice would be more sensible.
Holy moley, it's even crazier than I thought...Star Ninjer is a mix of Antonio and Genta o_O Wow. (And Grandpa's still an ass.) #ninninger
Half a Klonopin and a swig of Coke...the afternoon snack of champions, amirite?
@arrowned At this point I'll hold on to any hope offered.
@tsb_says ::snicker snort:: Pocky WISHES she got to do selfies with Yoshi.

Um, as do we all. ::coughs::
@arrowned I've got the O-T release, but I haven't had time with the kids to watch it. Maybe tonight. I hope Kiriko gets to be awesome.
@The2ndBatgirl And Awesome Dad should get to be one of the Last Ninjas along with the kids! He's so adorable :) He deserves a better dad.
@ashleycstj Too bad there aren't a million more interesting KR characters to make movies about...oh wait.
@kitaokaapologst Basically, I agree that "KR's not for kids" is dumb but I do think Kuuga was scarier in some ways than other seasons.
@kitaokaapologst Well, if I thought my 10-year-old would enjoy it, I'd let her watch Kuuga b/c AWESOME WOMEN. Generally, it's a kid's show.
@kitaokaapologst Haven't seen Agito, but so far (at ep 32), I'd be willing to show my kids Hibiki but not Kuuga. They love Drive/W/Wizard.
@Revieloutionne Ugh, that's up there with love triangles for boooooring and stupid storylines. Ugh.
@kitaokaapologst Ooooh, Kitaoka would *so* be into that. Gorou would do whatever K wanted. (K on the phone w/Shinji? K'd find that funny.)
@kitaokaapologst Well, I'm not terribly picky about which couple, but that would be a perfectly acceptable option :)
@kitaokaapologst YES. WE NEEDS PORNS. WE NEEDS MORE PORNS.
Er, considering RH Plus is about four vampires, let's consider "exorcised" an unintentional pun. My brain thinks it's hilarious. ::eyeroll::
Okay, so maybe it'll only be 3,500 words of RH Plus xover w/Hibiki that nobody will read. At least I've almost exorcised it from my brain.
@kitaokaapologst Hahahaha! I'm not sure one can even put Ren and people skills in the same sentence w/o the world exploding in irony.
Signed up for Remix challenge because...Remix! That and awesome PR women is enough challenges for now. Should finish other fics...
@kitaokaapologst I love him even though he's an idiot. Which was pretty much how I felt about all the Ryuki characters, come to think of it.
@chrislhayes I feel your pain. That's pretty much the worst feeling ever. Much worse than the "new baby at home and no sleep" thing.
@WatcherMark As long as it's moderately clear from the summary or tags or whatever, don't feel bad :)
@WatcherMark It's possible, but not advisable. I've written non-con b/c I wanted to know if I could make it work. It worked and it was cruel
@tsb_says I want a chocolate milkshake. Damn it, we don't have any ice cream in the house :(
I love these cards! I see at least 4 I want to buy for people I know... 
::stares:: Can I get a shirt that does that for my boobs? 'Cause it'd be super awesome to have anti-grav for them. 
@kitaokaapologst @pockysquirrel Yes, there was some acknowledgement of the reality of life there :) That's rare, I think.
@kitaokaapologst @pockysquirrel Yes, I wondered how JKP stayed open. Also, the restaurant in Kabuto where random people show up and cook.

1. Don't be in one
2. Seriously don't
3. Do literally anything else
But I'm not showing her the laundry monster. I'm awful, not CRUEL ;)
Planning to show Yael the Kabuto Dark Knife arc. Because it's never too early to break your child's brain, right? ::cackles madly::
Whew. Accidental baby acquisition fic is done. Or as done as it's going to be. Now maybe I should shower? Or work? Or have breakfast?
@kitaokaapologst Excavation kinda used to be my field (even if I did people, not dinosaurs). Also, I scream when shows get medicine wrong.
@kitaokaapologst I understand. I get irritated when shows do weird things in fields I know. Dino Charge and excavation, for example.
Oh gods, I'm going to end up with 5,000 words of Hibiki/RH Plus that nobody will read. If I can just finish accidental baby acquis. too...
@pockysquirrel @tsb_says I'll try to finish accidental baby acquisition?
@tsb_says Sounds like an excellent plan! I approve :) I recommend a suitable application of chocolate and/or wine as well.
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says ::points:: Yes. You love her. She loves you. You'll get through this. Remember...I haven't killed Avi yet ;)
Pardon me, I'm just having a "hating on our stupid heteronormative homophobic goddamned asshole of a culture" moment. :(
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel ::more hugs:: That was a reasonable thought. They are not being reasonable :(
@tsb_says She's being understandably ridiculous? I've had that fear that my crazy parents would drive people away :( ::hugs to both of you::
Watching Hibiki and RH Plus. Want to write Asumu and Ageha (same actor) meeting each other. It would be a storm of adorableness. Cousins?
@Rivulet027 I love those conversations. :)
Big horse race this afternoon
Important boxing match to follow

It's 1894 on Twitter
@kitaokaapologst It really really is. ::happy sigh::
I'm taking the claim APA supported torture very personally. (I've worked for them for 12 of the last 15 years.) 
@TokuLadies_Pod Yes, I'll get to finish listening at some point here. I left for a few hours to have pizza with friends :)
@TokuLadies_Pod Okay, all joking aside, I'd love to be a guest and that way instead of talking about me you can talk to me :D
@pockysquirrel @TokuLadies_Pod Oh good, I'm terrible at taking notes, because I start getting distracted and writing fic in the margins...
Eeee! I'm the official scribe of the @TokuLadies_Pod! Go me! Do I have to take notes? ;)
Congrats on your first year! Y'all are the best :) 
@kitaokaapologst Mmmm, that's a very nice look indeed. He should def. be encouraged to dress like that often :)
Zyuranger fic. 
Looking at my Geki/Goushi fic, I'm reminded that Zyuranger 32 is titled "Geki! Slash Your Team!" (Rewriting that fic this weekend, I think.)
@PunkPinkPower ::laughs:: Learn to procrastinate with fic and you too can finish fic early :D It helps to have kids you want to hide from.
@PunkPinkPower ::whistles innocently and looks at posted fic:: 

And this is why nobody likes me ;)
@kitaokaapologst Ha, this one's adorable :)
@kitaokaapologst Yes, you need to screen grab this. For me, er, for science. (Pics or it didn't happen!)
Finished/posted @kitaokaapologst's fic. I *think* accidental baby acquisition will be ready to post tonight or tomorrow for @The2ndBatgirl!
@ultrasandriders Seriously. Can you imagine a more awful set of parents?? Neglectful *and* abusive.
These examples never stop being amusing. And yes, I'll fight for the Oxford comma with my last breath ;) 
@PunkPinkPower @pockysquirrel probably isn't." Then I had to wait a couple of weeks to see the specialist to tell me it wasn't a tumor :(
@PunkPinkPower @pockysquirrel ::facepalm:: That's a great one. I once got (on the way out the door) "Well, it could be a tumor, but it--
@PunkPinkPower @pockysquirrel In my case, it was usually something, but I'm special like that :D I'm sure for *other* people it was nothing.
@PunkPinkPower @pockysquirrel Oh, doctors. My fave was always "I'm sure it's nothing, but how fast can you get to the hospital?" "Uh, FAST?"
@tsb_says I still haven't recovered from spoiler accusation when I said Lois Lane would be in next Smallville season. It was on billboards!
@kitaokaapologst He's an idiot. Surprise! No wait, no surprise. And every time he winces, it's gonna hurt Gorou too. Stupid Kitaoka.
@kitaokaapologst Nope, I'd say that's EXACTLY the right reaction to have. Spoiled greedy jerk :(
@kitaokaapologst I told you it sometimes works to prompt me. Now I MUST finish accidental baby acquisition, which I've owed for a while now.
@The2ndBatgirl SO GLAD I hadn't gotten up to get a soda yet. It wouldn't have been a pretty sight.
@kitaokaapologst Does this help? 
@The2ndBatgirl Keep in mind that to me, "munchkin" reads as "child". Now reread your tweet and see why I'm glad I wasn't drinking anything.
@Revieloutionne @kitaokaapologst Yes. Yes, indeed. Clearly I just made them angry by calling, right? ::facepalm::
@kitaokaapologst Why, it's because phones are evil. Who knows what awful thing the person on the other end might be plotting???
@lazycocos I really do. It comes of leading an odd life, I suppose.
@lazycocos 
@lazycocos By an amusing coincidence, that term was invented by an acquaintance of mine ;) Which reminds me we should invite them to dinner.
Survived Science Night. Kids now know proper trowel technique and how to tell a pot from a bone. Got invited to talk to another class.
@PunkPinkPower Ultrasound shouldn't be affected by piercings. MRI would be. Good luck and I hope everything is clear :(
@TerrierLee_ ::facepalm:: Oy vey. Nice to know that old canard is alive and well. No wait, not "nice". The other thing. Aggravating!
@kitaokaapologst Ha! I forgot about that. Okay, moaning. G is absolutely not aroused by that, not when he's looking at bruises. Nope. Nope.
@PunkPinkPower That's pretty much one of my mottoes. ::shrug:: Fake it long enough and people think you have a clue.
@kitaokaapologst It is indeed :D Not sure where this fic is going. I'm in G's head and he's not making a move. Not sure what K will do.
@kitaokaapologst Okay, I think I'm sticking with the couch. Off to writing now! (And staring at those pictures a few more times...)
@kitaokaapologst Ah yes, thanks. Hmm, it might work? If G put down a towel to keep the oil off the leather? It's low to the ground...
@kitaokaapologst do you recall what it looked like? G doesn't want K to stand up but I don't think the couch works for the massage at ALL.
@kitaokaapologst I'm going to go try and write for a bit now. Wait, important thing! Do you have a pic of the couch in their living room? Or
@kitaokaapologst Don't ignore Takatora in the shower. That's pretty much the only part of Gaim I'd be interested in except Bando. Anyway--
@kitaokaapologst My biggest KR ship is Godai/Ichijo, which is pretty much my only OTP ever in any fandom. I don't OTP usually. I multiship!
@PunkPinkPower Good call. That's a given, after all.
@kitaokaapologst Bwahahahahaha! That's awesome.
@PunkPinkPower It worked. They thought I knew what I was talking about ::snerk:: And I've been asked to come talk to more classes.
@kitaokaapologst ::is listening:: Oh myyyyy. Um, yes, that song is definitely a thing that happened. A thing that is very OTP.
@PunkPinkPower I just got back from Science Night about 10 minutes ago. I'm exhausted from talking to children for 2 1/2 hours :)
@kitaokaapologst And pictures are good. Veeeery good :)
@kitaokaapologst I have not but OMG I want to hear it! Is it on youtube or anywhere like that?
@TerrierLee_ So do I! I wonder if that was scripted or impromptu on the set.
@PunkPinkPower I mean, granted, I can't believe Tommy is a paleontologist *either*, but that's a separate problem.
@PunkPinkPower My friends have decided it's an honorary PhD conferred by the elementary school. But I'm still not a paleontologist.
@PunkPinkPower There are lots of archaeology PhDs but I have an MA. And I've never excavated a fossil. Bottles/plates/chicken bones, yes.
@trollprincess Mmmm, yes. I love furry guys :)
@trollprincess Mark Ruffalo's chest. ::happy sigh:: 

::looks around:: What? Were you talking about something?
@Revieloutionne Not 100% sure. I've only written 150 words so you never know what might happen later in the fic. ::looks innocent::
@WatcherMark @The2ndBatgirl I'm not sure I've ever believed it was getting made. Just...compare to any other movie w/ a ready fan base.
Thank you, Bartlett's Quotations search, but I'm not naming this fic any combination of "Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." ::snerk::
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says ::points:: Yes, that. I also like your wording about "equating vaginas with womanhood."
@tsb_says No, not at all. A notpology would be "We're sorry people were offended by what we said." You're properly saying "We done wrong."
@tsb_says I think that sounds good. Pretty much anything else would sound like making excuses and that's not what you intend.
Science night at Y's school. I'm doing archaeology demonstration. Note to organizer: I'm not a PhD. And I don't dig up fossils. ::facepalm::
@The2ndBatgirl Can *anyone* explain the Summers family tree? I thought it required a working knowledge of quantum dynamics or something.
@Rivulet027 Oh no :( Good luck with both nephew and puppy.
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Bwahahahahaha! Ryuki's not my fave show, but I do love these guys a lot :D
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 Is there life outside of toku? I find that difficult to believe.
@pockysquirrel It's only 13 eps. I'll be done with it soon, so I'll let you know if they manage to screw up later.
@kitaokaapologst I'm happy to read it :)
@pockysquirrel Not claiming this show is "good" per se, but it's kind of awesome so far in a cracky way. (Seriously: They fight crime.)
@pockysquirrel Team Mom spends half his time worrying about his "boys" (actual word used in canon) and the other half cooking for them.
@pockysquirrel This show pretty much defines ridiculous. Everyone's in love with the Team Mom, even the straight guy. (There's just one.)
@pockysquirrel I'm watching RH Plus, about four vampires living together. It has a Team Mom who puts Goushi to shame. They fight crime!
@tsb_says I understand. It probably is my laptop's fault. ::smacks laptop:: Bad Windows, no biscuit.
@kitaokaapologst Yay! I like talking out fic ideas :)
@tptigger42 Nagging does work on me. Unless you're my mother, father, or children :D
::points:: What she said! 
@tptigger42 @AngelNegra13 Okay, done! They're all kind of generic prompts, so I hope my recipient doesn't hate me :D
@donnajherren @Rivulet027 Ha! That's awesome. I would totally do that to my 10-year-old :D
@justshai ::facepalm:: Ugh, that's the worst. It's like "Who can I trust now?"
@AngelNegra13 @tptigger42 ::laughs:: I'll manage. You just have to keep nagging, b/c work, Science Night at the elem school, kids...
@kitaokaapologst Holy shit, that side glance. o_O Yeah, um, that's definitely inspiring.
@kitaokaapologst BECAUSE THEY LOVE US VERY MUCH.
@kitaokaapologst Okay, I need to sleep, but this is on my list of fics. Posting those pics of them will help b/c I'm a sucker :D
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel "People can't change" is a stupid argument for any adult to make. Kids' show but adult characters, damn it.
@kitaokaapologst Or both. He's a multitasker, I would think. Also got a twisty brain, so killing two birds w/one stone would appeal.
@kitaokaapologst And I love making people happy by writing their OTPs, so that works out nicely.
@kitaokaapologst poke at that idea too, if the massage one doesn't work out. Not sure G would be willing to teach. K would have to ask. Huh.
@kitaokaapologst I can see that too. I doubt he thought cooking was worth his time. Not sure what would happen with G teaching K. I might-
@kitaokaapologst But I didn't say that. *Gorou* and *Shinji* said Kitaoka is straight. And Shinji's an idiot and Gorou is...well, Gorou.
@kitaokaapologst ::coughs:: Yeah, the Gorou teaching Shinji to cook one. Apparently now everyone thinks I think Kitaoka is straight :D
@kitaokaapologst Yes! More fic is better! Other people should write. I feel like I've done half the KR meme fics at this point :D
@kitaokaapologst Hmm. So yeah, something like chemo/radiation does sound likely. I like this idea. No promises, as I said, but I'll try.
@kitaokaapologst So I could make it more or less whatever I wanted, if the plot needed that. But people will sorta expect brain cancer. Hmm.
@tptigger42 Possibly. I hate coming up with prompts, because my brain goes blank!
@kitaokaapologst Ooooh, now that's more my kind of story. I'm sure he's an expert masseuse! Was Kitaoka's disease ever spelled out?
@kitaokaapologst I want to *read* it! It's just not my story to tell. I know my writing limits :D
@kitaokaapologst Well, I ship it. No promises, because I have a ton of unfinished fic too, but when I get inspired...fic appears!
@kitaokaapologst -each other up, but that's not my fic to write.) Poke me with ideas and one might stick. (Just ask the Toku Ladies :D)
@kitaokaapologst Hmm. If you've got a prompt, that's often the best way to get me to write something. (I want the meme fic about them tying-
@tptigger42 Right. Yes. Must sign up. Tomorrow? Maybe?
@kitaokaapologst ::drools:: Y'know, at some point I'll have to write them properly, rather than just Gorou thinking Kitaoka's straight. Hmm.
@pockysquirrel Oh heck yeah. Yael and I decided we hate him a LOT more than we hate Gou. Gou has a redeeming value buried deep inside.
@Revieloutionne Oh, and Not!Asumu is SO looking for a daddy. Too early to be certain which kind, but it's adorable.
@Revieloutionne Todoroki is so head over heels for Zanki, it's not even funny. Well, actually, it's hilarious, but you know what I mean.
@Revieloutionne Also, Not!Asumu is almost as adorable as Asumu! Much less straight than Asumu (whose crush on Hibiki is platonic, I think).
@Rivulet027 Whatever it is, I probably want to talk you into it. Because couchcon bunnies are...crap, I haven't sent out the list yet!
@Revieloutionne I can't really call the show slashy b/c it doesn't bother to hide the m/m. Book guy might be totally straight? He's it.
@Revieloutionne Oh, so you're no help to me :D I'm on ep. 4. I'm used to you having seen everything first!
@Revieloutionne Watching RH Plus. Is Kiyoi actually oblivious to the way everyone is love with him or is he using it? B/c...wow.
Awesome!  
@arrowned Yeah. I'm still a bit boggled that anyone could miss how ridiculous it was to say those things. o_O
A paper on biased treatment toward women gets...biased treatment toward women. Irony, people, it's a thing. 
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne Holy moley, you're right: marshmallows. ::boggles:: I think that calls for something stronger than weed.
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne Kitaoka asked if he could have some yogurt, so Gorou, er, Bando was almost out of yogurt. It happens.
@tsb_says ::facepalm:: Well, I suppose it depends on what sexual knowledge they're investigating but really now...
@trollprincess Awesome!
@Revieloutionne @kitaokaapologst Aaaand, now I'm imagining his angsty teen poetry and my head hurts. It's prob even worse than mine was! Ugh
So far on RH Plus: Ageha and Makoto love each other, Konoe and Masakuzu love themselves, and *everyone* loves Kiyoi. More Mebius later...
@tsb_says I think apologizing and promising to do better is all you can do :(
@arrowned But it's so much fun to see stars and pretty lights.
@lazycocos I kept screaming "Of course they don't understand because YOU'RE NOT TELLING ANYONE" at the screen. No sympathy for Gou here.
@tsb_says ::tilts head:: Er, what? I guess you could argue it's anticapitalist (although I wouldn't), but I'm not seeing Marxism.
@tsb_says Bwahahahaha :)
@kitaokaapologst Kabuto has many wonderfully bad wrong ship possibilities that fandom has missed :D
@kitaokaapologst Or you could write me Yaguruma/Tendou hatesex, b/c I can't believe nobody has done that? ;)
@lazycocos o_O I can't really buy them not using birth control. I suppose a "birth control failed, oh crap" fic might be interesting?
@tsb_says @MorbySa I'm my own boss and I couldn't even convince myself :)
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne His voice. Oh my. He's in the "I could listen to him read the phonebook" category.
@Revieloutionne @kitaokaapologst I learned quickly to look at reviews of BL movies before watching so as to avoid that kind of ending. Ugh.
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne I watched them pretty close together too, so I definitely had some brain mixup going on!
@kitaokaapologst Do not question the gorgeousness that is Mishima. Just enjoy.
@Revieloutionne Glad to waste other people's time too :D
@Revieloutionne Yup, I figured. Not a subtle show, but that's okay with me. I don't always need subtle. Adorable dweebs works too.
@Revieloutionne I did notice that :D And I noticed football dork was pretty much the only one not snuggling.
Ultraman Mebius 2. Painting the jet is made of adorable. Okay, I'm sold on these dorks. (Preschool teachers are already superheroes, BTW.)
@trollprincess And that's not even *touching* the issue of living in a world where birth control never fails.
@trollprincess Yup, It'd be awesome to live in a world where nobody lost their job, nobody had a spouse die, nobody got sick, etc.
@Revieloutionne Awesome, I know crunchyroll. It's got Mibu from Fuuma no Kojiro too, I see. At this rate, I'll never watch American TV again
@Revieloutionne ::googles:: OMG, please tell me where I can find this. I need this in my life.
@UPPastryPlate Well, to be technical, I *am* a writer-searchadmin-editor-ninja-jackofalltrades, but I like being paid. And I can't code.
@UPPastryPlate Even if they *are* real jobs, so what? There may be thousands of programming jobs available, but I'm still not a programmer.
No spoilers, but kids and I just watched Drive 27. I liked the twist, Yael didn't like it as much, would have preferred slightly diff twist.
@ultrasandriders @Revieloutionne See, even though I started out for a shallow reason, it'll all be okay :D
::sporfle:: 
@Revieloutionne @ultrasandriders I'm finding myself surprisingly attached to this bunch, considering I put the ep on to gawk at Watanabe.
@Revieloutionne @ultrasandriders Yeah, they pretty much had me at that line.
@ultrasandriders @Revieloutionne He needs a hug, poor thing. And everyone saving bunnies was just adorable.
@ultrasandriders @Revieloutionne Nearing the end of the ep, I already love the dude hollering at Mebius for letting buildings get destroyed!
@Revieloutionne Yes. Yes, he does. And who can blame him. Watanabe is really very beautiful. No idea if I'll like the character...
But really people, have you *seen* the man? ::stares::
I'm not saying that I'm shallow, but it's entirely possible I watched the first ep of Ultraman Mebius just b/c Watanabe Daisuke is in it.
@arrowned I'm shorter than you and I have a taller car and yet *I* manage to smack my head on my car now and then. It's a talent.
@WatcherMark Yeah, I have a feeling his English is going to be something between hilarious and painful for us.
@tsb_says [dry like the Sahara] I can't imagine why. [/dry]
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne The advantage to dubs for me is that I don't have to read aloud when I watch with Barak ;) I prefer subs.
@deb_bailey I love your cheesy clip art. Super excited to be a member of The Incredibles this time :D
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I'm intrigued by these ideas and encourage both of you to write fic. ::chin on hands, waiting patiently::
@pockysquirrel This is me coveting. Covet covet covet.
@justshai Ha! I've had that happen too, where the completely obvious solution eludes me b/c I forget I'm a grownup.
Toured retirement community here in Rockville with my parents this AM. Very nice. I'm ready to move in immediately.
@Rivulet027 I can't wait for you to watch more so we can squee together :)
And I'm reminded again of why Soledad O'Brien was too good for CNN... 
@tptigger42 I'm sad and unsure what I'm supposed to do :(
@kitaokaapologst There's a lot to be upset and passionate about. I'm just sad and burnt out :(
@MorbySa Heh. Yes so much to the "Time without children? What is this crazy talk?" :D
BTW, yes, I'm aware of what's going on in B'more. I grew up not far from there. (My parents are still nearby.) I just can't deal right now.
I don't dislike Cloud Cloud as much as some, but this was an unsatisfying ep overall. Mom is...a snob? An absentee mom? Who knows?
Y'know, I didn't want a Yakkun focus ep, but if you're going to do one, could you, I dunno, actually give us characterization? #ninninger
It's been a Monday, but listening to/watching Barak write his homework is pure hilarity. "Tert" turns out to be "took". Who knew?
Okay, at this point I'm pretty sure C and I are talking to a bot rather than a person, b/c the e-mail responses are getting less coherent.
@TheQuinnspiracy @trollprincess I'm lucky, privileged offline, but w/o my Internet friends, I'd be dead. Going offline is not an option.
@pockysquirrel ::facepalm:: Twitter (esp the bots) is so WEIRD. I just got followed by Aristotle Quotes. ...the fuck?
@tsb_says Eh. Once we get going on testing, I'll be okay. Now it's "But what if I screw up and they learn I have no idea what I'm doing?"
It's very Monday. Very very Monday. Having a major Imposter Syndrome kind of day, in fact. I'll just be over here whimpering if you need me.
@Rivulet027 ::facepalm:: Gender doesn't convey nail painting ability. I have none. Avi does it nicely b/c hand/eye coordination.
@wamu885news @kojoshow Good! This problem is ridiculous. I've seen people be towed for going to a diff store in the same shopping center.
@The2ndBatgirl @RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel Holy cow, Steve would be such a Red, wouldn't he? Bruce is blue?
@CSarracenian @lazycocos I do hate the American casting of much older people to play teenagers! "Dude, you haven't seen HS in 10-15 years."
@tsb_says ::blink:: Uh...um...I'd be honored? I'd babble a lot? ::blushes a bunch:: Seriously? Me?
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says ::scrolls down Twitter feed:: HOLY SHIT WTF?

There's no question the man is trying to break our brains.
@kitaokaapologst When we lived in LA &amp; ate kosher Chinese food made by Mexicans, I said "This is what my anthro profs called 'postcolony.'"
@Revieloutionne But fandom is nothing but sweet, lovable, happy... ::falls off couch laughing:: Yeah, couldn't manage a straight face.
@kausikdatta22 Surprise! No, wait, the other thing...not surprising at all!
@Animefangirl89 @lazycocos @TokuLadies_Pod We saw Souji at the school, w/classmates, but did we ever even see Amy with a book?
@GailSimone @trollprincess The good news is that your hopes will almost certainly become reality. The bad news is...yeah. It'll happen.
@tsb_says Or whether or not your MIL will show up. You should be arguing about music for the first dance. Sorry our world sucks?
@tsb_says Understandably neurotic. Your biggest problem should be the food options, not whether your GODDAMNED STATE will let you marry.
@lazycocos @TokuLadies_Pod But I'm sure if they thought they could get away with it, Kiriko would be played by a 16yo. ::snort::
@TokuLadies_Pod Also...I'm NOT writing the fic where Taka yells KITAAAAA! or whatever in bed. Deal. You can't give me *every* stray bunny ;)
@TokuLadies_Pod I completely agree about the awesomeness of Dad and awfulness of Grandpa in Ninninger. Dad=win; Grandpa=dick.
@tptigger42 Atheist, so yes, we use electronics :) I'm going to try and sign up now, but the kids are being obnoxious.
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel I need to sign up too! Will probably need more reminders, since I'm still getting organized.
Yay! Something to listen to while I work this morning :) 
@Rivulet027 Heh. I think both my kids spelled "zoo" first. Or maybe their names?
@Rivulet027 Alas, I had Barak with me, because his class starts 45 minutes after Yael's, so I had to deal with hyper boy :(
Forgot only Barak had Hebrew school today, so I dragged us here an hour early. FML. Yael is calmer than me:  She has a notebook to draw in.
@MorbySa Mom yells at kid working with Dora monster :) 
This message brought to you by Hibiki 23, which features a great deal of Hibiki drumming in a sleeveless shirt. I approve of this. Aaaarms.
Dear makers of toku: You have many flaws, but I must applaud your addiction to a) closeups of asses and b) hot men in sleeveless shirts.
Finally back to watching Hibiki. Asumu in the marching band with his little whistle! ::iz ded of kewt for millionth time::
@arrowned @pockysquirrel @kitaokaapologst It was really good, though! Just...feels! I cried for the laundry monster, damn it! And the Earth!
@kitaokaapologst I just...those episodes are the crackiest crack ever. I love them so much that I had to break everyone's brains with them.
@kitaokaapologst Oh, Kabuto. ::is amused:: We showed the dark knife arc at Couchcon to the appropriate reactions of "WTF?" and o_O.
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel Yes, you should, because I would read the *hell* out of it, I'm sure :)
@Revieloutionne Best. Scene. Ever. I melt into a puddle of happy goo just thinking about it.
@kitaokaapologst Ha! I got that one :) (I actually was spoiled for that particular plot twist.)
@TerrierLee_ "Toku means never having to say you're kidding." ::shakes head::
@The2ndBatgirl ::sporfle:: Gods, I'm so glad you introduced me to toku.
@lazycocos I was SO happy to see little boys buying Peppa's Ballet Lesson. I only had to elbow three adults who were trying to dissuade boys
@lazycocos At the fall book fair, the Peppa Pig book was the most popular with both boys and girls. \o/
@Revieloutionne Molly! I miss her so much :( I wish she was here to help us deal with the horrible things happening in the world now.
@kitaokaapologst I'm sorry, is it possible to make it with another bread? And if so, WHY WOULD YOU? That's insanity, people. Goyim, I swear.
@lazycocos I'm trying to remember back when Avi and I dated and he and M shared an apartment. I think I did contribute? I know I bought food
@kitaokaapologst Our friends joke about doing things with Jews and we joke about hanging out with goyim. As long as it's friends saying it.
@UPPastryPlate He said WHAT? Are these people even listening to what they're saying anymore? How can you say that with a straight face???
@TerrierLee_ Then there was the time I was online ordering pizzas for Yael's bday party at midnight and Avi thought card # was stolen...
@TerrierLee_ Well, I'm usually up around that time and I need to get things done while the kids are asleep, so I've placed orders then :D
@justshai ::hugs:: Therapy and drugs are good things. Self-injury isn't something to mess around with.
@SilurianRanger @arrowned ::sporfle:: That's a good one :)
@Revieloutionne Can do!
@TerrierLee_ She's the adult version of certain kids: "This book costs $12 and you have $3." ::look of confusion::
@tsb_says I know where to find you. I *think* I have everyone else's e-mails?
@TerrierLee_ Man, shutting down the book fair basically involved us walking around and saying "Go away! Get out!" Ugh, people..
#couchcon2015 attendees: Now that the book fair is over, I can finish typing up all the plot bunnies. E-mail/DM me if you want the list.
Final book fair sales total: $10,300! It's pretty close to last fair's record-breaking total, so I'm pleased :)
@deb_bailey YES!
Book fair sales at $9,000 with a few hours to go. Not quite my goal, but a respectable amount.
After all this time, I figured the kidnappers would kill him. Or his mediocre health would. I never imagined friendly fire as the cause :(
I hadn't seen him in years (he traveled so much) but his wife drops by my house when my mother is visiting, so they can get coffee.
It's super weird to read news stories about Warren Weinstein today on the WaPo front page and remember New Year's Eve parties at his house.
@kitaokaapologst @pockysquirrel Woman is something in other places and they like pink things?
Someone gave the book fair $125 to buy books for the pre-K kids! Someone clearly remembered to be awesome today.
My mother says the family isn't sitting shiva, so there isn't much I can do right now for them :( 
Nothing says "Have a nice day!" like finding out a family friend held hostage in Pakistan was killed in January in a US counterterrorism op.
@lazycocos @Revieloutionne @CSarracenian Oh gods, this storyline is going to make Yael and I scream EVEN LOUDER, isn't it? ::facepalm::
@pockysquirrel @TerrierLee_ Guess I should hold off on writing pt. 2 of my "parents in toku" essay, then :)
@jamiekilstein Let's make that a thing! I now have ::counts:: hundreds of new friends!
@MartinPribble @SallyStrange Thank you. Now I can go back to chewing my fingernails and pacing the floors knowing my place in the struggle.
::points:: Yes. This. This is totally what I am. 
@MartinPribble @SallyStrange Yes! I've been looking for the right title for myself and THAT'S IT! I mean, it's that or Team Mom.
@kausikdatta22 That's horrible. As a parent I couldn't live with myself if that happened to my kid.
@lazycocos Yeah, Sakura is definitely the best example to prove them wrong. She was absolutely written as the smart/sensible one.
@Rivulet027 SERIOUSLY? The idiots really managed to do that despite having it spelled right on all the paperwork? That's talent, yo.
SO TRUE. He's the perfect husband. 
@kitaokaapologst He's hot. He's an amazing cook. He's loyal. He'd beat up anyone who was mean to me. Sounds perfect to me!
@TerrierLee_ Yup. I always say I'm really sorry but I just don't have the time to write other people's fic along with my own.
@kitaokaapologst Too bad, really. Especially when they create these awesome characters and then...don't give them anything to do.
@kitaokaapologst Oh sure, there are good seasons. See: Kuuga. But you have to admit that it's not a show noted for well-written women.
@kitaokaapologst What? A Kamen Rider series that doesn't handle women as interesting people in their own right? Say it ain't so! ;)
@tsb_says B/c how can they possibly exist? I totally understand not believing it!
@kitaokaapologst He totally shouldn't have been that hot, but absolutely was. He's even hot when he scowls and threatens.
@kitaokaapologst Oh gods, Yuge. I adored him as Gorou (surprise) and Mishima (oh the sexy suit). Not enough for me to watch Gaim, though.
@The2ndBatgirl ...the fuck?
@tsb_says I'm pretty sure that's the kind of opinion for which o_O was invented. Because....o_O
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel Not trying, but succeeding.
@tbq_ @trollprincess Shocked. I'm shocked to find gambling in this establishment.
@Revieloutionne You jinxed it by speaking too soon, didn't you? There are always feels.
@pockysquirrel @tsb_says I dunno, but I might be getting it too!
@sentai_ebooks Well, it's Yoshi, so I can see how it might happen.
@pockysquirrel Ugh. I know those feels. I hope they get you home soon :(
@pockysquirrel You can do that? I had no idea.
@scalzi So glad I'm not the only one who started singing that song!
@kitaokaapologst I was bored by all the Gaim characters.
@tsb_says This is me covering up my ears and going lalalala, b/c I cannot deal.
@pockysquirrel ::epic facepalm:: Why???
@RiderJetfire I never saw that one. Didn't hear good things.
@RiderJetfire Hee. Let's not discuss my "Walker, Texas Ranger" phase, okay?
@RiderJetfire Loved that show so very much. Characters, plots, dialogue, everything.
@Rivulet027 Yay for Koda! (autocorrect made that kids, BTW)
Small book fair crises solved. It's going to be an awesome fair! Pre-K kids looking at books now. Made of cute!
@RangerCommandPH ::bows:: Glad to be of assistance
@RangerCommandPH Maybe the human *was* a stevedore? Was he anywhere near docks or the Abandoned Warehouse District?
Since apparently my phone helpfully deleted @The2ndBatgirl's phone number, consider this my notice I'm safely down in DC.
@pockysquirrel One more step in my clever plan to revive LJ/DW fandom! Bwahahahaha!
@Yoshistunts I just watched season 1, which was hilarious. Every Sentai trope EVER!
Although considering storm timing, my earlier flight might get diverted anyway! Currently no planes landing at DCA...
Seriously, I was 10 feet away from the correct gate! WTF? How do I do these things?
Sitting right next to gate. No loudspeaker announcement for flight. Which left without me. Me so talented. #epicfacepalm Home an hour later.
Sitting in Atlanta airport already missing #couchcon2015 :( But it was the best vacation ever, so thank you @The2ndBatgirl, @MorbySa, et al.
Geki and Goushi are the most adorable and perfect 90s gay couple. #thecutest #couchcon2015 
Now worried I've completely traumatized @pockysquirrel with pregnancy stories. Ack!
#couchcon2015 has been broken again, this time by Brennan's yogurt video. That...it was...I...OMG, how is he a thing?
@arrowned arrives home and area has possible hail and tornadoes. Hmm, very suspicious ;) (Seriously, WTF, weather?)
@WatcherMark I don't object as much to baby pics, though there's a limit, but wedding? Only right after event, then 10-year anniversary.
@Popehat Evidence of healthy 8lb babies aborted? I'll read indictment when I get to a computer, but I'm dubious.
@Popehat He's a piece of shit. But wiki article doesn't say why women needed late-term or how late they were. 21 weeks? 30 weeks? Big diff.
@Popehat Wow, would love to see the evidence for that. Because why would she wait that long if she didn't want baby? That's a 40-week baby!
@Popehat Not comparable. People don't have late-term abortions for fun, but because their baby is already dead. It's a necessary procedure.
@arrowned Oh no, 14 hours? We're sorry to hear that.
Oh gods, I probably just summoned some poor PR person, didn't I? Don't, okay? Just don't
Sigh. Delta website crashes when I check in on phone or computer. Guess I'll be checking in at the airport. Eyeroll.
@WatcherMark We were screaming with our need to give Dragon Caesar hugs.
And now we're having feels for the sentient robot who misses Burai. Wah!!!!!! #couchcon2015
Zyuranger 42 just broke #couchcon2015. Burai died and we're crying. Wah! So many feels!
@settiai This is what we call the "oh but didn't we tell you?" syndrome.
Shaolin Granny. She's a stranger to love and fashion. o_O This movie. THIS MOVIE.
@TerrierLee_ You mean one more hour until you go to urgent care, right?
@SallyStrange Even if it's true, and I'm dubious, who eats that much dried basil? Milk is def overhyped, but many veggie claims are odd.
@TerrierLee_ #couchcon2015 consensus is to go to the damn doctor. @rivulet says you don't want it to go septic.
@SallyStrange Are you certain about that? I know broccoli has a lot but it's not the same as milk. I don't say milk is necessary, but...
@Revieloutionne: So the place gets a lot o…
Motto number three of #couchcon2015: Finishing fic earnestly!
OHSHIT Zyuranger just broke #couchcon2015! Geki and Goushi and OMG this is too much. ::is dead::
Great Satan was defeated after @arrowned left. Hmmmm... #couchcon2015
@arrowned Wah, don't go! Oh wait, you live near me. Never mind :)
LRT: Go buy her book! If it's half as hilarious as her last book (which you should also buy!), it'll be totally awesome.
Two Zyuranger fics started, both Goushi POV. Surprise! I totally love the team mom. #couchcon2015
@Frito_KAL I'm so very very sorry :(
@TerrierLee_ Sleep! Sleep is super important
Geki. He's very good at what he does. And what he does is Goushi. #couchcon2015
@DigiRanger1994 Understandable :)
Me: We watched a lot of Zyuranger. Avi: Is that J E W Ranger? Me: Uh...no.
I'm sorry, WHAT is this episode called???? 
@pockysquirrel I must write some kind of fic for them. Because holy cow...
Sending up the @RiderJetfire signal! We're back to VR Troopers to recover from the Zyuranger episode that doesn't exist.
For the record, Zyuranger 23 does not exist. It was inexplicably skipped during production
No no no, Zyuranger, don't pull the "oh, if you like a girl then you're mean to her" shtick! And now he's stalking her :( #couchcon2015
Second official motto of #couchcon2015: Shut up, Dan! (Because Dan is the worst one in Zyuranger.)
So far this morning we have seen the crack that is Dark Knife and gotten feels from a laundry monster. #couchcon2015
@UPPastryPlate I *know* he doesn't know what Common Core is! Same goes for a lot of its critics. And its supporters. ::sigh::
Posting the link to the Sentai prompt meme again for #couchcon2015 attendees. Please prompt/write! 
Listening to everyone else play Power Rangers Dash on their phones is kind of hilarious. #couchcon2015
@RiderJetfire Love to  if you can wait a couple of weeks. I'm booked solid next week.
@Rivulet027 And soon there will be celebratory drinks :)
Shamus, we love you! "@RiderJetfire: No vest, but still. @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl 
Things we learned at #couchcon2015: If you see a portal, go through it. Clearly that never goes badly.
@RiderJetfire I figured that was our best shot at summoning you! Pocky thinks you'll do a Kool-Aid man through the wall.
@arrowned @RiderJetfire  Did you know in Japan the yellow ranger was a boy named Boi? ::runs away quickly::
The American morpher had to go hide in embarrassment afterward. 
@Yoshistunts @BrennanMejia Only in the manga version. Y'know, *that* kind of manga.
Sleep. I hear it's a thing people do. Maybe we'll try it now. I'll let you know if it turns out to be a cool new trend.
I suspect a Zyuranger ep starting with "Minnesota Fatso" is probably only going to get worse. o_O
Official motto of Couchcon 2015 :) 
For the record...couchcon still hasn't finished the first Zyuranger. Two drinks have been consumed by most, however.
On the way to couchcon! We're half an hour out, I'm told.
@The2ndBatgirl Just landed. Heading to baggage claim but I'm pretty much in the last row of the plane so...
Didn't miss flight! Did rip pants walking to Metro in the dark but whatever! On my way to Atlanta in an hour!
Kids are asleep. Bags are packed. I think this qualifies as being on vacation. ::collapses in a puddle::
@MorbySa Yup! Think of meat and dairy as having cooties. I can't get meat cooties on dairy and vice versa ;) Veggies aren't meat or dairy.
@MorbySa Alas, yes.
@MorbySa long as it has no dairy, I'm game. I've got maybe half a pound? (It's at home and i'm not.)
@MorbySa depends on what you plan to do with it, I guess.
@MorbySa Ha! I just bought some kosher salami to bring with me :)
@tsb_says @MorbySa SOON. SOON I WILL DESCEND AND ALL WILL DESPAIR. Or give me hugs. Whatever. Need hugs. Lots of hugs.
@Rivulet027 @tsb_says Alas, I still have to deal with getting Yael to Hebrew school and what to do with Barak for the 2 hours. And bedtime.
I'm checked in for tomorrow's flight :) Now I need to figure out if it's easier to walk to the Metro or drag everyone out of bed so early.
Typo of the day (Not in Fic category): tasters instead of tasers. That...gives me some amusing images.
KR Hibiki is so adorable, I'm tempted to give it to my parents. I think they would love these characters too! ::ded of adorable::
@TerrierLee_ Yup. "Your lack of planning does not constitute my emergency."
@justshai You absolutely positively 100% do not. Nope. Trust me.
I might have read your fic if you hadn't titled the series "Dairies of Dino Heroes." B/c after that milk fic the other day...
@pockysquirrel Ugh!
@pockysquirrel Ugh. I couldn't do all-nighters then and I still can't now!
@Revieloutionne The definition of acting whiplash: switching between Takumi and Agri o_O Now Renji and Gosei Blue? Pretty much the same.
@Revieloutionne Seriously! This is kind of hilarious. Were the Takumi-kun movies before or after their toku appearances? I'm hazy on timing.
Oh look, Gosei Blue just showed up. At this point I wouldn't be surprised by anyone.
@arrowned @Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 I think those two eps of insanity stand okay on their own. Because WTF.
@arrowned @Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 Hooray! Did we decide to force the others to watch the Dark Knife arc?
To recap, Bouken Black aka Byakko from Fuuma no Kojiro is currently playing tennis against Kirikaze who is being cheered on by Gosei Black.
Aaaaand, the dude playing Fuji in this Tenimyu video is Kirikaze in Fuuma no Kojiro. I know Japan's a small country, but really now.
Ha! Just remembered that if I don't bring my CPAP to couchcon, everyone will murder me in my sleep to stop the snoring ;)
@TerrierLee_ I'm kinda short on space on my laptop and I hate transferring stuff to the desktop, so I like youtube sometimes.
@TerrierLee_ Wait, I saw that movie on Youtube. I mean, I couldn't download it, but I did watch it. I didn't recognize Abareblue! I liked it
@TerrierLee_ Abareblue??? If you do get the movie, pretty please may I have it b/c ABAREBLUE??? ::whimpers quietly::
@TerrierLee_ Yeah, at some point my head started to explode. It's like watching Tenimyu videos, where half the cast are toku actors.
@TerrierLee_ I started trying to count as I was watching and lost track somewhere around the time I went "Is that the Blue Buster?"
@Revieloutionne Mmm, I don't recommend it. I spent the whole movie interpreting everything Gii did in light of Nago's personality!
@TerrierLee_ Those movies were A+ examples of the "holy shit, if y'all would just talk to each other..." genre.
@TerrierLee_ I enjoyed them all but I wouldn't claim they were *good*. They just hit some particular kinks for me. You know how it is.
@arrowned Woot! See ya soon :)
@TerrierLee_ ::nods:: Good point. He really was, wasn't he? I liked the movies despite his awfulness.
@Revieloutionne I mean, not that Shinnosuke looks ANYTHING like Gii, but who cares.
@Revieloutionne ::dies laughing:: I now want all the fic where Gii and Akaike left their wealthy backgrounds to become cops.
@TerrierLee_ It so does. Does this make Shinnosuke Gii? I think Chase is Takumi, though, so now I have to ship them.
@Revieloutionne YES. Which does make it more hilarious, because I can totally see Akaike smacking Gii, er, Shinnosuke in the head :D
@Revieloutionne I just watched them like two months ago :D
In case anyone wondered *just* how bad I am at recognizing faces, I've just noticed that Hayase in Drive is Akaike from the Takumi-kum films
@tptigger42 Mine too! Woot!
@The2ndBatgirl @TerrierLee_ Hahahaha! I love that someone strung all those clips together. Too hilarious :)
@tsb_says This could have been me, for various complicated reasons. I'm very glad it wasn't. I would have punched someone.
@tsb_says Seriously, this might as well have had a "MARA, DO NOT READ THIS, YOU MORON" notice and I read it anyway. Me dumb as rock.
won't set off your PTSD at all, right? Too bad you're not ENTIRELY aware of your triggers so you can avoid them. ::facepalm::
Brilliant, Mara. Go ahead and read the story of the woman who miscarried and couldn't get the "abortion" drug she needed. I'm sure that--
@pockysquirrel I'm definitely in the clothes category. It'd be nice if I knew what Barak did with my Ranger keys, though. Grrr.
@The2ndBatgirl Yay! Happy birthday and see you soon :)
@trollprincess If I take out both earbuds, I like you. If I take out the earbuds *and* close the laptop, you're probably my kid or hubby
@UPPastryPlate Real life? Is that the thing where I have to talk to actual human beings? I don't approve of it at ALL.
@StarImaginNinja But yeah, they're a bit young for Ian :D
@lazycocos I can tell I'm not awake yet, because that took me 2 reads to get. Yes, it's a great name :)
@TerrierLee_ It's the weirdest assortment of fic! The second part of a two-parter. One for an obscure book series. And so on. Aggravating.
@travelingheidi Yes, exactly. Add up all the time fandom has spent on this and how much good fiction have we not written or read :(
Ugh, they've got 15 of my stories. I sent a legal notice to them and Google, but ain't nobody got time for this shit 
@mizzelle Well, I only managed to submit a few to Google b/c their interface is very clunky and I don't have time or energy :(
@mizzelle I just sent them a message as isfanficlegal suggested. Doubt they'll listen, but what the hell. Also sending to Google.
@seananmcguire Damn it, I searched again and this time I found like 10 or 15 of my fics. UGH. So irritating.
@Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel Wait...yes, there are a bunch of mine. I didn't see them on the author list, but when I searched they were there
@Rivulet027 I didn't see any of mine, thank goodness. But UGH UGH UGH.
@seananmcguire How awful on both counts. Kinda missing the point of both fic and your free stories. I checked and none of my fic was there.
@RiderJetfire I have the same problem when I say "I don't drink." People always take it as a personal criticism of their drinking habits.
@RiderJetfire I don't actually drink more than one or two drinks a year :) But this will be my once a year.
@RiderJetfire I'm going to watch it first at couchcon. I figure copious alcohol and good company should improve it immensely.
Ha! I escaped getting a parking ticket and dental cleaning is done. Debating whether to give them a second chance with filling replacement.
@tsb_says Waiting half an hour with time running out on the parking meter isn't helping.
Waiting to see first new dentist in 15 years. Hi, panic attack, I haven't missed you AT ALL. FML.
@Revieloutionne @arrowned Really? I've been in toku fandom for less than a year and I already go in expecting cute and amusing. Huh.
@StarImaginNinja There you're past my ability to predict her behavior.
@arrowned Basically, it was a typical xover: Adorable and amusing, but no substance. But who watches these expecting substance?
@Revieloutionne @arrowned ::imagines Decade in a corset:: ::drools:: I'm sorry, you were saying something?
@StarImaginNinja I ship pretty much everyone with everyone. Mio and Tokatti are cute.
@StarImaginNinja She's not human so she doesn't have a concept of shame. I meant it literally.
@Revieloutionne Ibuki is adorable too :) And Akira. And Kasumi. And Zanki. And...yeah, everyone.
@StarImaginNinja Squealing less loudly, but still squealing.
@StarImaginNinja Oh, I think she's the loudest. She has no shame whatsoever.
Is there anything more adorable than everyone in early KR Hibiki? Asumu &amp; Hitomi! Hinaka &amp; Todoroki! Hibiki finding the puppy! Asumu's mom!
@StarImaginNinja Oh gods yes. She's squeal louder than anyone else!
@StarImaginNinja I think anyone who doesn't squeal when they see is a heartless no-good person.
@StarImaginNinja That was definitely the part that made me squeal :)
@arrowned That sounds like a valid use of a Sunday night :D Of course, I spent it watching ToQger vs. Kyoryuger, so...yeah.
@StarImaginNinja I squealed. There was actual squealing with glee. I had to put a hand over my mouth 'cause my kids were sleeping!
@StarImaginNinja Oh yes, in-suit kids was adorable!
@StarImaginNinja Akira with a baby :) Of course, I'm a sucker for a guy with a baby, so...
Having watced ToQger vs. Kyoryuger, I ship Akira/Utchy now and Hikari/Souji in about 6 years when Hikari's legal(ish) ;)
Exactly what I needed right now! Two adorable teams in a wacky xover :) 
@TerrierLee_ I guess, but still...feet. ::worries::
@TerrierLee_ I'm a mommy. I've seen MUCH worse. ::looks:: I don't like it. They're not minor and burns on the feet should be seen by doctor.
@Revieloutionne ::googles:: 1988? Hmm. Yeah, I think that's entirely possible.
@TerrierLee_ Okay, I'm seriously still worried about this foot. I'm not sure it should still be this painful days later. :(
@RiderJetfire @karenkirkland I had to google this but WOOT! Go, Shamus! So excited for you!
@PunkPinkPower Also, I spent several afternoons at my in-law's with a pad of paper. It was write or deal with screaming children. ::coughs::
@PunkPinkPower Well, it was either procrastinate on the fic or procrastinate on paying work. So...fic!
@trollprincess It happens often enough that it goes like this: B: "Who's that?" Me: "And what do I say?" B: "Wait and see." Me: "RIGHT."
@trollprincess OMG, this is the worst part of watching TV with Barak. "Who's that?" "Maybe if you SHUT UP AND WATCH you'll find out."
17 handwritten pages later, the first draft of worldbuilding fic is done. I hope it will amuse my recipient as much as it has me.
@tsb_says If you're still there, how much are they? I could bring one back as a present for Barak.
@justshai I know somebody who does. I know how to call someone an idiot and say thank you and say I'm transforming in Japanese :)
@pockysquirrel I second the motion.
Wow, worldbuilding fic is zooming along. Not enough Adam, though. Sorry, @The2ndBatgirl. Maybe at the end?
@PunkPinkPower My exact words were "Glad to know I vote for the right party." Sorry, dude, but those are positives in my book.
@PunkPinkPower On FB a fundie told me voting for Dems is endorsement of abortion, gay marriage, and promiscuity. I said "great!" Heh.
@PunkPinkPower Well, you know that atheists prefer babies above all other foods, so obviously that was a valid reading as well.
Er, baby *fic* is near done. There will be no more babies around these parts, thankyewverymuch.
Also, yesterday I made progress on both accidental baby acquisition and PR worldbuilding fics. So yay! Baby is near done, even.
iTunes is playing Time Judged All because it loves me. So there. And I'm alone, so I can blast it. Woot!
Wait, this one isn't already a category? I'm so confused. 
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I am intrigued by your ideas and wish to subscribe to your newsletter. Yael says "YEAH!" to K kicking Gou.
@arrowned ::facepalm:: Oh, parents. That's something mine would do also. I break down in tears when that happens.
@Popehat Huh? I think it's awesome to be called a SJW. My only regret is that my singing is too awful to be a Social Justice Bard.
@trollprincess Ugh :( I've had a few teeth pulled in my time. It sucks.
@trollprincess His tooth wasn't hurting now, so it was a hard sell for him. Hard to say "you'll feel better" when he feels fine!
@trollprincess My poor little guy :( Poor you, too. I hate dental stuff.
Hundreds of dollars and some tears later, Barak is now missing one very infected tooth. At least his adult tooth should be safe. :(
Oh joy. Barak has a huge abscess on his gums. Off to the dentist to make sure it's nothing serious. ::fingers crossed::
@Revieloutionne @PunkPinkPower ::nods:: Yes, that. But even knowing that, all I see is how I fall short as a friend, mother, employee...
@PunkPinkPower Gee, that sounds familiar. Almost as if...I do that all the damn time.
@PunkPinkPower @Revieloutionne THAT WOULD BE SO AWESOME.
@PunkPinkPower @Revieloutionne I would probably give a limb to have dinner w/Greta Christina and Rebecca Watson ;)
@PunkPinkPower @Revieloutionne I love pretty much everyone at Women in Secularism, for example :) A friend got me autographs 2 yrs ago!
@PunkPinkPower @Revieloutionne Oh yes, absolutely. There are amazingly wonderful women and great male allies. I just...can't deal w/people.
Ouch. Spot on and painful. 
@PunkPinkPower @Revieloutionne UGH. This is why I hate organized anything most of the time :( I can't handle that behavior.
@tptigger42 @PunkPinkPower Yeees, getting me started on this is also dangerous. It leads to ranting and waving hands and such.
@PunkPinkPower @Revieloutionne Wow. I love Rebecca Watson and I would love to go hear her talk. I watch all her videos.
@Revieloutionne @PunkPinkPower -uncomfortable" not "OMG MEN ARE EVIL". Get a grip. You don't have an absolute right to women's attention.
@Revieloutionne @PunkPinkPower Elevatorgate was really a tipping point for me in realizing the awfulness. She said "Guys, this made me-"
@The2ndBatgirl Henshin is more like "change" in the sense of change into a costume while henge is more "magical change", which makes sense.
@The2ndBatgirl Inorite? If you have a question you've always wanted answered, I bet he'd be willing to answer 'cause he's sweet like that.
@PunkPinkPower Yes. My feminism and secularism are nothing if they're not for social justice for all. And stuff.
We had fun discussing why toku uses so much English and how manga is used for everything and what henshin and henge mean.
Had dinner the other night with a native Japanese speaker who is *also* a linguist. I hope he's ready for ALL THE QUESTIONS from me :)
@PunkPinkPower I did have a really amazing time at the Reason Rally, though, for whatever that's worth.
@PunkPinkPower Yeah. I've been really disillusioned since the whole Shermer thing at TAM and the rise of the Slymepit, etc. :(
@tsb_says EEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
@The2ndBatgirl @arrowned @Revieloutionne I would favorite this, but that's not strong enough. Where's the OMGOMGICAN'TWAIT button?
@arrowned That sounds like a useful service. I could probably use some help with that. We need a workable definition first, though.
@pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl IS IT TIME NOW? HOW ABOUT NOW? NOW?
@TerrierLee_ ::nods:: I can totally agree with that. And considering how much I love the Professor, that's saying a lot.
@tptigger42 I'm glad I'm not the only one who has the "Bloody hell, our people should be BETTER THAN THIS" reaction to these things.
@tptigger42 Oh ugh. I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I sure am disappointed :(
@The2ndBatgirl Offscreen about halfway through, I think. At least I'm about 90% sure they did. Because really now...
@mizzelle Oh ouch. It's one thing in fic, but in a book...yikes.
Ugh, I heard about this last night :( 
@mizzelle There are typos and then there are typos that just make me stop in my tracks and go o_O.
Yet another way to throw me out of your fic: Use "wonton" when you meant "wanton." Now I'm hungry. But not in the way you intended.
@MorbySa @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @PunkPinkPower @TerrierLee_ Because in the end aren't we all Fran?
Listening to @TalkinToku and the crying baby is my fave part already. So adorable when it's not *my kid* crying :)
@Revieloutionne @ItsRibbit This is the greatest thread in the entire universe. You both win the Internet for the day.
Totally agreed! 
@tptigger42 @TerrierLee_ That makes me so giant squid of rage, I can't even say. ARGL.
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel ::snerk:: Seriously, I NEVER wrote porn before toku! Well, twice in however many years. Look what you've done to me
@tptigger42 @TerrierLee_ I know, right? Better we should leave people uninsured until they go on disability than let them get early care.
@tsb_says Maybe it will meet with an "accident"?
@tsb_says Pardon me while I go somewhere to be extremely nauseated. Blech.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @PunkPinkPower @TerrierLee_ Bwahahaha! Y'all crack me up :) Can I be Fran? I'm nerdy and awkward!
@TerrierLee_ LOST A TOE and part of his foot last year. But he's diabetic so that's a whole horrible thing. But you should still see a doc.
@TerrierLee_ Can I revoke her mommy license long-distance? 'Cause infected feet trump money. Maybe I'm just on edge because a good friend-
@TerrierLee_ Also, why is your mother not throwing you in the car and dragging you there herself? I'm a bit far away to do that.
@TerrierLee_ Seriously, this is my worried mommy face over here. Is there an urgent care type place you can go?
@TerrierLee_ Well, they can tell you if it's INFECTED AND ABOUT TO KILL YOU, for one thing. Swollen is not a good sign.
@TerrierLee_ Yes! Mama Mara says you should go *right now*. I'm going to worry until you say you've seen a doctor, you know.
@Revieloutionne I don't hate him but my mommy instincts make want to holler "Child, sit down and LISTEN for once!"
@TerrierLee_ I know! I hadn't seen ToQger yet when I wrote it, which has SO MUCH parent/child stuff in it.
@TerrierLee_ My fave (as you can tell from my blog post) is Ryoga from Abaranger :)
@TerrierLee_ I hope we get a focus ep for *him*. Otherwise I might have to write fic, 'cause parents need more love.
@TerrierLee_ 
@TerrierLee_ I wrote a blog post about that :D Because I'm *fascinated* by how parents are portrayed, when they appear.
@TerrierLee_ Yeah, I was much more emotional over than scene than pretty much anything else. Granddad's a major asshole and I felt for Dad.
@TerrierLee_ ::nods:: Yeah. And every time he shows up I wonder if it's time to go water the plants or do the dishes.
@TerrierLee_ Yeah, I'm not feeling the rivalry. It's pretty yawny so far. Maybe I'll care later?
@RiderJetfire ::hugs and good thoughts::
@mizzelle @The2ndBatgirl That's it. Must be allergies since it's spring.
@The2ndBatgirl ::sniffles:: Is someone slicing onions in here again? Or maybe it's just very dusty.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel Yay! I really really want to read that fic, so I'm happy :)
@lazycocos Ahim and Kagura were certainly girly, but anybody who didn't think they were tough was watching a different show than I was :D
@lazycocos Oh gods yes, that would be SO CUTE.
@The2ndBatgirl @MorbySa Is there anything better than Tsubasa or Souta's ass? I'm not certain. We may have to do some comparisons.
TFW you reach behind you during a meeting to get lip gloss, forgetting your lunch plate covered with turkey gravy is there...
@pockysquirrel Oh no :(
@TerrierLee_ Oooh, that looks good! ::bookmarks:: Wait, they have the Fuuma no Kojiro manga there? ::bounces happily::
@TokuLadies_Pod Also, I'd like to note that without fandom, I wouldn't be *alive*. Fandom friends have kept me going in my darkest times.
@TokuLadies_Pod ::sniffles:: I would totally friend marry you folks too :) Can we make that a thing?
@TerrierLee_ Preferably ones with happy endings. A lot of bl movies I've found seem to have "rocks fall, everybody dies" endings.
@TerrierLee_ I'm totally down with any bl manga turned into movies. Any suggestions?
Just lost 45 minutes of work time due to Office 2013 crashing my machine AGAIN. I don't know what I'm going to do :(
@justshai Well, I don't like peanut butter, so that I don't miss :) But rice is one of my favorite things ever.
@justshai I hate you I hate you I hate you ;) I want my beans and rice!
Cooking for Passover=panicked phone call to Avi in supermarket: "I forgot margarine! And eggs! And sugar! And orange juice! And..."
@TokuLadies_Pod Oh boy, I can't wait to listen! It might have to wait until tomorrow, due to the seder :(
@Revieloutionne Probably someone has, but I'm sure he couldn't hear it over the sound of what an asshole he is.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel Hmm. I've got two very strong possibilities to decide between when I'm more awake :D
@JacobPoshka I love Boukenger! Such fun characters and dialogue.
@lazycocos I would be fascinated (and probably squicked) to know what Inoue would even *consider* a healthy relationship.
@pockysquirrel I don't understand getting mad at someone's headcanon. Disagree with it, wonder where it comes from, but...
@trollprincess When Avi and I eloped and got married by the JP, we ate at a four-star restaurant :D Def better than homophobic pizza.
@drjaneypeterson ::grin:: I changed the name on a day when my kids were being particularly...challenging, shall we say. Now I'm attached :)
@drjaneypeterson @Rivulet027 Great shirt! Might have to get for my kiddos.
Downloading Office 2013 seems to have reset my Word defaults...even in Office 2010. Must. Resist. Fist of Death.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel And now I want the fic with Hibiki and Ibuki complaining about their clothes budget. Hmm...
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel The characters in TheBee are...not my first choice. Or tenth choice. However, Yaguruma's *actor*? Yeah.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I'm sure we'll like it anyway. More fic is better.
@UPPastryPlate @PipsBadIdeas Well, I suppose it's a clue in that I'm not you. Which eliminates one person in the US, right?
Eeek! I got retweeted and favorited! #noticemesempai ::giggles madly:: And now I need to make the kids clean up for Pesach. Blech.
Contrary to popular opinion, I'm *not* @UPPastryPlate. Although whoever they are, their opinions match mine to an astonishing degree. ;)
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne So do I. Someone needs to write it for us ;)
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I think he would if it made Godai feel better about being Kuuga, made him feel like less of a monster.
@pockysquirrel Well, clearly they couldn't let the other two guys take their RPF title away, right? Something had to be done. And I approve.
Watching Asumu recover from his appendicitis surgery is making my c-section scar ache. I know how he feels (bet my scar's bigger, though!).
@pockysquirrel Yeah, that was pretty much what I thought while watching. Alas, I was watching with the kids, so I had to keep it clean ;)
LT: I wish I could help. I've *had* dental surgery with no sedation and it was one of the most horrible experiences of my life.
Needed: $250 to pay for 12-year-old kid's sedation during surgery. TN pays 4 surgery but not sedation. DM @SallyStrange for PayPal info.
@SallyStrange I wish I could :( I ran into that same stupid dental surgery thing years ago and it pisses me off. Surgery is surgery!
@mizzelle @tsb_says Why would someone think a citation only including the author's last name and three words of the title was okay?
@mizzelle @tsb_says I'm very sorry to hear that. Bibliographies are made of evil.
Yup, nothing like hearing that the police caught a guy for indecent exposure A BLOCK FROM MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL to brighten my day. UGH.
@tsb_says I'm still pretty traumatized. Like the one where every reference was missing one or more pieces of info. And all diff. styles.
@tsb_says I used to edit dissertations for a living. Which means editing bibliographies. You can probably guess at my pain.
@seananmcguire I cried. You totally made me cry over a mouse :( (I mean, that's intended as a compliment, but still.)
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Oh UGH. ::facepalm:: Yeah, I'll be hiding. Let me know if it's ever safe to come out again.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Is *that* why blue? o_O I mean, I'm kind of hiding under a rock until it all goes away, but...huh?
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says Bwahahahaha! Yeah, that's unexpected :D
@tsb_says @Revieloutionne o_O Do tell!
@pzmyers Exactly! Left or right, anti-gay people are assholes and people who make death threats are assholes. I repudiate all death threats.
@joshuamneff Yup. I mean, I would never in a million years want to support the place financially but...death threats? Not helpful.
Dear whoever made death threats to the anti-gay pizza place,

Get off my side. You're making my side look bad. 

No love, 
Me
@pockysquirrel They really really really are, though. ::throws hands in the air:: I dunno.
OFFICE 2013 IS EVIL. I THINK IT WAS MADE BY SHOCKER. IT'S PROBABLY AN EVIL PLOT TO DRIVE US MAD.
@pockysquirrel Don't be sorry. Gaim isn't worth your time when you could be watching something GOOD.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I'm glad I'm not the only one agonizing. I went with the Sentai folder, but I may make a movie/xover folder.
@Revieloutionne @RiderJetfire Yeah, there's definitely a lot of "Ooookay, just go with it" there :)
@Revieloutionne @RiderJetfire That's the big xover movie guy? I was just explaining to the kids that one deals with xovers by handwaving
@arrowned And it gets worse. ::facepalm:: I still really enjoyed the show, but...well, you'll know when you get there.
@arrowned Yup, that's why my gender rating went where it did. I was loving her and then...o_O
@RiderJetfire And I don't know if it was the writers who decided they wanted the romance or if it was a message from on high.
@RiderJetfire ::nods:: Fair. There's an Enterprise scene I rewrote b/c someone decided to shoehorn in a romance where it didn't belong.
@RiderJetfire That's a good point. I do try to keep those restrictions in mind, but y'know, sometimes we're just given bad writing from pros
@tsb_says Please to be keeping me far far away from this woman when I'm there? I'm feeling homicidal...
@tsb_says I don't know that much about PCOS but...pregnant more than once? That takes a fair amount of work with PCOS!
@tsb_says If you got pregnant in 2 tries, I highly doubt you have PCOS, lady. And...fuck, it took us 5 years, 6 rounds of IUI, and 1 of IVF.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel I third the sentiment. And now back to combing through a mind-numbing spreadsheet.
@tsb_says On behalf of all infertility sufferers, she can go to hell. ::starts counting years and dollars and drugs:: ::loses track::
@tsb_says ::snickers madly:: It would be hilarious! B/c you know they were all "how dare they?"
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel Oh myyyyyyy.
For your amusement: Internet Searches Create Illusion of Personal Knowledge, Research Finds 
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel Oh gods, do I want to know? I still haven't finished accidental baby acquisition yet!
@The2ndBatgirl I figured!
@The2ndBatgirl Yes, that's why I left the official Twitter in there for my comment :D I would buy the HELL out of official ones.
@The2ndBatgirl @PowerRangers We *are* going to get Energems necklaces for real, though, right? Lie to me if you have to. I want an Energem!
Just out of curiosity, how many stupid responses *can* I make to this work e-mail? At some point I have to run out of dumb, right?
@tsb_says Yup, me too. So many good fic writers I know are writing original stuff and...ugh.
@tsb_says Why can't some of the GOOD fic writers get this kind of thing? I don't understand :(
@lazycocos ::facepalm:: But if you vaccinate the majority of people as kids, then they *can't* get shingles as adults. Long-term good. Sigh.
@lazycocos Wow, that's awful! There's been a vaccine in the US since 1995. I was thrilled to realize my kids would be vaccinated against it.
@seananmcguire No no, texting isn't the worst. Phone calls are the worst!
@lazycocos A child has chickenpox in this day and age? Er...how? We have this lovely vaccine for it.
@plutoHimself @ultrasandriders Remove me if you think it'll ruin anything. I'm only 6 eps in but not spoiler averse.
@ultrasandriders Well, I might stop watching at 30 too. After all, I stopped watching Blade early so I could live in my 'verse instead!
@ultrasandriders @plutoHimself I already love the characters and the music. Could Asumu be any more adorable? I wanna make him cookies.
@ultrasandriders Ah, that's right, I knew that. Oh well, I'll be prepared at least.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel The funny thing is before toku, I'd written smut maybe twice? Romance, yeah, but a lot of gen too.
@pockysquirrel I want to be a professional shipper too! Please, let me study with you and perhaps one day I can attain this status?
Started watching KR Hibiki. The music is amazing. Asumu is an adorable boy. Lots of great female characters. I hope it continues like this!
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel ::snickers madly:: I'd say I'm secretly 12 years old emotionally, except it isn't all that secret :D
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel Maybe he's just worried his...abs aren't as big as theirs.
@pockysquirrel Oh myyyyyyyy. Um. Well, then. They're rather more exhibitionist than we thought, hmm? ;)
@Rivulet027 Yes, definitely a case of "Did you *think* about how it sounded? Maybe run it by someone else? Try that next time."
LRT: The sad thing is that my first thought was "And how will they justify having white actors in this movie?" Because racism.

#yoshiforlishang
@Rivulet027 ::spit take:: Bwuh? I don't know what that is, but it certainly sounds...bad. o_O
Fourth attempt to get Lync downloaded to my machine. IT guy is still calm. Must be on good drugs. Why do things never go smooth?
@trollprincess I would have had "after 10 minutes" in the pool, but someone beat me to it. I think I got stuck with "after 25 minutes"?
@Revieloutionne When we die, can our loved ones sue them for KILLING US WITH ADORABLE?
@Rivulet027 @tptigger42 I was SO MAD. I was also pregnant and needed to go back to that hospital to have Barak. Don't mess w/pregnant women.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 Then I sent a certified letter to the debt collector. THEN I reported them to the state attorney's office. Hmmph.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 I called them. Twice. Then I faxed copies of my card. Then I sent them a letter. Then I sent a certified letter.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 Yeah. Reminds me of the time the hospital claimed they weren't given the right insurance health info for me.
@Rivulet027 Heck, when my card was stolen, I couldn't have proven it wasn't me! The charges were all local but I didn't pay any of them.
@Rivulet027 UGH. Definitely be irate. That's utterly ridiculous. Considering *they* caught it, they can't claim you made it up or whatever.
@lazycocos @Revieloutionne I've def read fic that was better than the show. And I will read Kiva or Gaim stuff if it looks better :D
@RiderJetfire We all have tv/movies like that :)
@RiderJetfire Oh gods, I vaguely recall my high school boyfriend showing that movie to me.
@MrChangeDragon @pockysquirrel Yes! I loved that he was being "helpful" and mansplainy and she was getting on with defeating the bad guy.
@arrowned ::hugs:: I don't think anyone ever is ready for losing a loved one.
@pockysquirrel @MorbySa @tsb_says ::nods:: Yeah. For me, there has to be some kind of happy(ish) ending. Some feeling that things get better
@MorbySa @pockysquirrel @tsb_says Yeah, that's why I don't write it much. But reading it...hmm. Words are failing me here!
@MorbySa @tsb_says There's also a bit of enjoying seeing how characters react to the hurt? I dunno. When it's in-character, it can be great.
@MorbySa @tsb_says For me. Well, mostly. Can't say for others. I don't write it much b/c my skills lie more in comedy but I do read it.
@MorbySa @tsb_says Mmm. Sort of? I think we're in it for the comfort part? Or at least I am. The hurt is what gets you to the comfort.
@tsb_says @MorbySa -kill you" kind of stuff. The image of someone taking care of someone who's been hurt is powerful to me. I own my kinks!
@tsb_says @MorbySa I dunno if I can explain it, but I do love h/c. For me it's my giant kink for protectiveness. Like, "touch her and I'll-
@tptigger42 I'm not thrilled with Israel's behavior, either, but I hate that it's become "Jews are evil, let's kill them all!" time again.
@tptigger42 I think we got so scared when things got even crazier than before. Somehow it's gotten to be okay to hate people again.
Wow, green, pink, *and* purple are already sold out. Those are the ones I might have bought for me, so... 
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl Seriously, I think I'm going to wait on the necklaces and the hubby being employed, esp if no pink
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl But how can that be? PR fans are all guys so who's buying them? Must be for those girlfriends. :D
@Revieloutionne @lazycocos I can absolutely see that. I think the only reason I might finish Gaim at this point would be glimpses of Bandou.
@lazycocos the Justice of the Peace, and Avi's aunt and uncle. Too bad we had to go to Maryland do the big Jewish wedding thing 6 mos later.
@lazycocos I can't imagine wanting that. I much preferred my *first* wedding, which was in Las Vegas and had 5 people in the room: me, Avi-
@pockysquirrel -and I'm always curious what other people thought. (Whether or not you love them as much as I do, I should add.)
@pockysquirrel I can't wait to read them! I'm looking forward to a long-form explanation of what you thought of both. They're 2 of my faves-
@lazycocos o_O Oooookay. I wanted to skip the wedding *entirely* and I certainly wouldn't have wanted three photoshoots. Ugh.
@lazycocos @Revieloutionne The biggest advantage to never having finished watching Gaim is that I don't feel compelled to read the fic :D
@ashleycstj ::nods:: Yeah, I find I do better if I watch an ep here and an ep there, rather than trying to do a proper rewatch. I cry!
@ashleycstj I love that show SO MUCH. Just...everything about it.
@TerrierLee_ Yeah, color me vastly amused :)
@Revieloutionne ::eyeroll:: Really now? It's a kink meme! This is fandom! Make a prompt like that, you get what you deserve :D
@Revieloutionne And what in the world was the prompter expecting, anyway? This is pretty much what I saw coming (pun intended).
@Revieloutionne There's a Prince of Tennis fic that's fairly close to this, er, odd fill. I wonder if it's the same author?
@Revieloutionne You'd think that people would realize by now that no matter how insane the prompt...someone might just write it.
@pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl Aha, thank you! Now I must consider the budget and how much the hubby will kill me if I preorder...
@The2ndBatgirl But where do I find them?
@MorbySa I've occasionally half-heartedly followed baseball. I understand how others can be sports fans, but it's just not for me, I guess.
@MorbySa ::checks the Google machine:: Oh, it's football? For some reason, I thought they were a basketball team. Huh.
@MorbySa Just for the record, I was REALLY worried about this for a moment, until I realized it was sports related ;)
@tsb_says Yay! My old car didn't pass last time and it was a PITA.
@SarahNEmerson @jamiekilstein It's almost as if they've never seen the Internet before. ::dies laughing::
@RiderJetfire But it was so KIND of him to help you when you didn't understand your OWN sexuality, right? ::wipes sarcasm off keyboard::
@pockysquirrel Oh yeah, the hubby and I discuss how hot we find various actresses.
@pockysquirrel I just went for my annual mental health exam :) I probably need one or two more visits to get myself back up to speed.
@tsb_says Eh...hard to say. I think a blogpost on "um, yeah, we're here" isn't a bad idea in general. You can say it was "inspired" by RB?
@The2ndBatgirl @MorbySa Abaranger is super good fun, I highly recommend it! Abare Yellow is the smartest one. Canonically, even :)
@Revieloutionne @lazycocos If we complained every time there was an incredible coincidence, we'd never do anything else.
@lazycocos Don't tell me anything bad someone said about Akiko! Lalalalalala! I'm covering up my ears!
@lazycocos I mean, most KR series have actual plot holes, I'm sure. This just isn't one!
@RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel Yeah, I guess you have to look at it as "How helpful of you to show that I can ignore you!" Ugh.
@lazycocos A...plot hole? o_O How in the world is that a plot hole? I think it's what we call a "plot development" in the real world.
@tsb_says I twitch every time I see a headline. Do you know anything about mental illness, folks? Maybe you could call my employers and ask?
@RiderJetfire I...guess? But I'm kinda thinking it might be best to avoid anyone who says that because...WTF?
First of all, NO. Having depression does not explain crashing a plane. Also, do we want to discourage people from getting treatment? ARGL.
Can I just say how tired I am of the plane crash coverage with its "oh, he was treated for depression and that explains it!" focus?
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Possibly too on the nose, but it almost made me spit-take my breakfast, so...yeah.
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel Oh man, I'll so get these for Barak!
@RiderJetfire I'm struggling to think of a legit reason to say that. The only ones I've got involve not knowing what "bisexual" means. :(
@GretaChristina ::facepalm:: Strawberries are almost the only fruit my son will eat. I'll have to find an alternative source. Wah!
@Rivulet027 That looks remarkably like my son's "don't work on your laptop" face, actually.
@arrowned I was worried if I tried to put the actual number I might run out of tweet characters. I mean, dark knife ALONE is 542/10.
@tptigger42 @TerrierLee_ What? But we all know there's absolutely no sexism or mistreatment of women. Especially on the Internet :D
Plot: 6/10
Characters: 9/10
Gender: 5/10
Hot Characters: 10/10
General Enjoyment: 8/10
Hilarious Ridiculousness: 542/10
Finished Kabuto. Not a bad ending as KR goes. Enjoyable season as long as you're expecting a lot of WTFery :) I liked it.
@kitaokaapologst @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl Anxiety is why I mostly haven't done cons in YEARS. My hubby has never been to one, AFAIK.
@kitaokaapologst @The2ndBatgirl I dragged my *father* to my first convention when I was about 11 years old. I still have the DW t-shirt :)
@Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel You have excellent instincts, young padawan. Trust them.
@SallyStrange Do you have any idea how hard it is to find Mulan figures? As the mommy of a Mulan fan, I can say it sucks.
@arrowned @tsb_says @pockysquirrel I decided my blood pressure would benefit from me *not* looking. And my family appreciates it too.
@docfreeride @SallyStrange I love donorschoose! I used to run a fundraiser for my b-day asking people to donate to a project in my name.
@RiderJetfire I get the urge to distinguish ourselves from the Muggles or Mundanes or..but really now. Can't we all just enjoy our thing?
@RiderJetfire Bwahahahahahahaha!

...wait, someone said that non-ironically? ::facepalm to infinity::
@The2ndBatgirl @kitaokaapologst Well, as a female SF fan, I haven't existed my entire life, so I'm okay with this.
@kitaokaapologst @The2ndBatgirl This is me in my happy corner of fandom that doesn't include the whiny children of RB :) Lalalala!
@TerrierLee_ I'll have to try and find that.
@TerrierLee_ Ooooh, no, I haven't heard that. I liked his song from Ai no Kotodama, though.
@mizzelle @The2ndBatgirl Once I was buying comics for me and classic SF for my father and me. "Are these for your son?" o_O Noooo.
@TerrierLee_ The Wings were so the best part of Go-onger. Especially b/c I would listen to Tokuyama Hidenori read the phone book.
@The2ndBatgirl "Uh, guys? The person buying comics is over there." Finally all the employees started to recognize me. ::eyeroll::
@The2ndBatgirl This reminds me of the times I would drag Avi into a comic book store and the employees would talk to him and he was like--
@ThePlasticGeek Yay! Maybe one for me and one for my son and one for my daughter and... ;)
@The2ndBatgirl Lemme know when they're available so I can maybe piggyback on your order? I have to think about it.
@The2ndBatgirl Are they going to be necklaces? Or necklaceable? If so, I might need one. Or one for me, one for Barak, and purple for Yael.
@The2ndBatgirl I get it! It's circular logic: The people I want in fandom are in fandom because they're the ones I count as being in fandom.
@Revieloutionne I...but...what? o_O I mean, I'm used to slash fic being called "not fandom" (WHATEVER) but con attendees? WTF?
Yael and the girls from across the street are having a serious conversation about why they deserve laptops. Ha! And I say again, ha!
@Revieloutionne Ya think? Nah, that's just crazy talk! ;)
@The2ndBatgirl @Revieloutionne @RiderJetfire Bwahahahahahahaha! ::falls off couch:: What darling precious little snowflakes :)
@RiderJetfire @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel Go, Shamus! (Not reading the thread, but I trust you.) And me losing my shit there wouldn't help
@The2ndBatgirl @RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel TSB, you've seen me lose my temper on LJ so...yeah, that's why I shouldn't comment.
@arrowned But...we women LOVE being mansplained to! And being condescended to! It's the greatest joy in our lives! ::eyeroll::
@The2ndBatgirl @RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel Please make sure I do not respond b/c I will regret it. As will anyone w/in the blast radius.
@tsb_says Uh...yay? ::facepalm::
@Revieloutionne I don't exist! Go me, I've always wanted to be invisible! Also, my daughter the KR Drive addict would be irritated.
@SpideyWing @The2ndBatgirl I don't know. I don't see straight white guys in my corner of PR/SS fandom, so maybe they don't exist? ;)
@The2ndBatgirl And the girl Rangers are pink b/c EVO PSYCH BULLSHIT ABOUT FLOWERS, right?
@The2ndBatgirl I can't even fucking deal with some people, who've apparently read too much evo psych for our own good.
I'm not quite at the end of Kamen Rider Kabuto yet, but I'm currently thinking the moral is "JFC, people, USE YOUR WORDS!"
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl I don't buy morphers. I'm thinking about buying this one. Because hamburger.
@ultrasandriders @pockysquirrel See, you just need to come live in my reality and it will all be better. Also, Ankh didn't die in my world!
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel INDEED.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne ::giggles madly:: 50 was so wonderful. I love the way the actors are cracking themselves up.
@ultrasandriders @pockysquirrel Ugh, no comment there.
@ultrasandriders @pockysquirrel Yes, that's exactly right! How did you guess?
@ultrasandriders @pockysquirrel But...but...in Ryuki everyone lived and nobody forgot each other and it was sunshine and puppy dogs :D
::coughs:: Yaguruma put himself in chains. I'll...be in my bunk. (Okay, Tokuyama Hidenori is hot in *anything* but this is, uh...)
@ultrasandriders @pockysquirrel Neither ending happened in my world. Everyone lived happily ever after. So there.
@ultrasandriders @pockysquirrel Ugh, I hated both of those endings. In fact, I stopped Blade 3 eps before the end and stuck with headcanon.
@pockysquirrel ::nods:: Yeah, I thought that was going to be the case, but I didn't want to say anything and spoil the ending.
@pockysquirrel 
@tsb_says Babies tend to like sleeping all day and staying awake all night, so you'd probably be fine up to around 12ish weeks. Probably.
@tsb_says Well, I can't help you with A, but that's not a *terrible* time to share an office with a baby as long as said baby isn't colicky.
@tsb_says Well, newborns mostly sleep, so no biggie. But after a few months, they start having a lot of awake time. Different matter.
@tptigger42 What? Jews Vs. Aliens? Sounds awesome to me. Have you read the classic collection of Jewish SF "Wandering Stars"? Good stuff.
@trollprincess Yup, it's one of my fave subjects! Pox had some good stuff about how it affected our *foreign* policy. Highly recommended.
@trollprincess Polio: An American Story looks good. ::adds to wish list:: I thought you meant Pox: An American History, which was GREAT.
@DelilahSDawson @Rivulet027 ::snort:: Seriously. I'm not sure where they learned civics but their reading comprehension SUCKS.
@mollycrabapple @UPPastryPlate @Shakespeare_Co A beautiful drawing of an amazing store. Good memories there.
[BIG Kabuto spoiler] Is anyone on this show *not* secretly a Worm/Native? o_O (Wait, don't answer that, I've only got a few episodes left.)
@pockysquirrel I think the big bad made more sense after the ending. Although it took me a few processing days to totally get it.
@ami_angelwings @SallyStrange I remember that episode! ::giggles madly:: Loved it.
@Yoshistunts They usually do good subs, so I'm going to trust there's a good reason :D Can't wait to see the Kyoryuger/ToQger xover.
@pockysquirrel The jogging is my second favorite scene :) They've clearly spent the night together, with "well, I guess I need to go now".
@lazycocos I like Power Rangers and historical romances and comic books and paranormal romances and military SF and light fantasy and...
@lazycocos Yeah, pretty much. I hate the "these are girl shows and these are boy shows" thing. We should be able to like what we like.
@The2ndBatgirl @MimiHyde @claireidactyl Yes! They were great and the episode was great and girls doing science and saving the day! :D
@secretrangerfan It's not a small number of exceptions, it's millions of people who can't earn enough to support themselves/families.
@lazycocos Exactly. This is an example of one of my fave tropes: The hero who saves the villain b/c they can't just let someone die.
@secretrangerfan Sure...if you make more than the amount needed to cover food/rent/etc. But what if you get laid off or make min. wage?
@lazycocos Someone (other than Gou) is saying she shouldn't try to save him? o_O The kids and I shrieked with joy when she found him.
@tsb_says No no, that's okay. I totally agree with you. I hate the "well, if people just saved money" bull.
@tsb_says Oh dear. Classism. Sigh.
@TerrierLee_ Mine does that about every 10 minutes. All day. Every day. Because I moved a hard drive from my old/dead laptop to the new one.
@arrowned Er, strike that second "I suppose". ::tilts head:: I hate when I forget to proofread before hitting "Tweet".
@arrowned I suppose it wasn't *worse* than the average toku gender-wise, I suppose, but it could have been better. I still had fun, though.
Kamen Rider Kabuto 34: Because everything's better with time travel, right? (I get the feeling the WTF levels are about to exceed maximum.)
@TerrierLee_ ::hugs:: Oh, that's the worst :(
@TerrierLee_ Same goes for the boys in the neighborhood I know. Luke/Eric/Ian/etc. had better also behave or run very very fast.
@TerrierLee_ If my boy grows up and does that to women, he'd better hope I never find out or else he'd better be a damn fast runner.
@arrowned I'm glad you mentioned it, I really enjoyed it!
@TerrierLee_ ::facepalm:: Even if they could, it's still no justification for it. I'm sorry that happened :(
#TedCruzCampaignSlogans Smarter than Louis Gohmert and better looking than Harry Reid!
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel It really is. Why can't I just go back to bed and read fic all day?
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 I know it's a bot, but I have this image of Voldemort hovering over a computer cackling evilly.
@pockysquirrel Does Twitter ever remind you of a horror movie where if you mention the monster's name, it appears in your mirror? o_O
@pockysquirrel No experience with Walmart. Got good glasses from Costco, though.
@pockysquirrel I don't approve of the adult thing. I need to make a dentist appt. And one for the boy. And work. And deal with sick girl.
@lazycocos Yael keeps developing more and more elaborate theories of what happened to their parents. Can't wait to meet Shin's dad, though.
@plutoHimself @pockysquirrel I haven't seen the new ep yet, but I'm so very much #teamkasumi :)
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Yes. Go find your true love. And the thumbs up. I died.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne I've watched that scene half a dozen times and honest to Darwin, I can't find a non-slashy explanation.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne That scene..."do you have dreams?" "Godai and I are perfect for each other." I'm sorry, WHAT? ::loves::
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne YES YOU FINALLY GOT THERE! I've been waiting. I'm pretty sure I said OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG!!! when I saw it.
@pockysquirrel She's kinda badass :)
@The2ndBatgirl Er, I meant 23. Slip of the finger. Or brain. Or whatever.
@tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl That's the one. I don't mind him, *except* for the way he and Taka assume they're the only last ninja candidates.
@tsb_says The gender stuff is no worse than the average sentai. But the women are fully dressed and the men are eye candy so...
@The2ndBatgirl Yael says "Agreed." Although I almost kinda sorta felt bad for him after watching 21 just now.
@The2ndBatgirl It would be difficult? Not impossible, mind you, but difficult. That was a particularly bad xover, probably b/c Gaim is dumb.
@The2ndBatgirl Ka-su-mi! Ka-su-mi! Ka-su-mi! #kasumiforlastninja ;)
@pockysquirrel Hmm. I don't remember. Maybe? I looked, but the wiki didn't help me.
@tsb_says I got it from TVN. The subs aren't bad. In fact, I think they even translated "tachi" ;) I think you'll enjoy it.
Final Fuuma no Kojirou score
Overall Enjoyment: 8/10
Plot: 7/10
Dialogue: 9/10
Gender: 4/10
Ridiculousness:10/10
Hot Shirtless Men: 25/10
@GIGABEETLE @DansTokuRants o_O Ooooookay.
@TerrierLee_ INORITE? I already buy Tyler/Shelby a thousand times more than I bought Daigo/Amy, which was so out of the blue.
@plutoHimself YES! That was exactly what we wanted to see as a result of their first interactions. Absolutely perfect.
About halfway through the ep, Barak jumped off the couch and started screaming "Shelby and Kendall are AWESOME!" over and over. I agree.
HAVE SEEN NEW #POWERRANGERS #DINOCHARGE EPISODE. CAN ONLY TYPE ALL-CAPS DUE TO AWESOME OVERLOAD.
@tptigger42 Argl, his party was last week!
It's not toku without at least three gender-related scenes that make you facepalm. Badass chick writing guy's name over and over? Seriously?
We weren't home today, so Barak and I haven't seen the new #dinocharge ep yet. Alas, we probably won't get to see it until late tomorrow :(
@Revieloutionne ::snerk::
@BurgundyRanger @MimiHyde @claireidactyl Yay for Marylanders! Howdy from Montgomery County :)
Well, that got serious rather quickly o_O Still enjoying it, though. And the Fuuma no Kijriou viewing will continue...but not tonight.
Kouu ties Koujirou to a tree and tickles him w/an arrow. "He's so cute he just can't resist." Tell me why there isn't fic for this show?
@pockysquirrel It's like you know me or something. It would be so adorable and romantic...
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne I have one friend whose pregnancy was worse. But I managed an assortment of horrible things b/c I'm talented.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne I hated pregnancy for various reasons, so you won't get any argument from me. It was AWFUL both times, even.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel It's surprising how early you can feel your adorable little parasite :D But I showed early due to an illness
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel His hairstyles are certainly...unique. But I do love the long hair of later in the series.
@Revieloutionne I mean, to each their own and all that. For all I know it's incredibly well-written. But I have no interest.
TFW you see a new KR fic posted at AO3 and then you realize it's a new chapter in the Faiz/Kim Possible xover. ::facepalm::
@Revieloutionne @arrowned Well, okay, maybe taking itself a little bit seriously but in the way that usually bodes well for a show.
@Revieloutionne @arrowned Dunno if it's got as many but it's delightfully ridiculous so far. It's not even *trying* to take itself seriously
If, like me, you can't resist the "only sane man" trope, you're gonna LOVE Yagyuu Ranko, though. She's already my hero. ::hearts::
Watched the first ep of Fuuma no Kojirou over lunch today. A bit more adult than SS and KR. Fairly hilarious. The usual gender caveats.
@arrowned Eeee! I love Masumi's actor! I've watched Ai no Kotodama like three times already. I can't wait to watch that ep tonight.
@arrowned sucker for the "only sane man" trope and she's obviously aware that she's the only sane person around :D
@arrowned Ha! Halfway through the first ep. I strongly approve of his need to leave his shirt unbuttoned. Also I approve of Ranko. I'm a-
How often did the actors crack up while filming these? Tadokoro's brother, Tendou begging to be taught the meaning of cooking, OMGSOFUNNY.
"Those are the graves of ones who risked their lives but were unable to master cooking." ::iz ded:: Dark knife arc officially most hilarious
@arrowned I remember when they opened, replacing a crappy computer place. We quickly decided we preferred the new store :D
@pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl @RiderJetfire Pls to retype, as I want headcanon today :)
@arrowned Yay, Micro Center! Man, we've given them a lot of money. Love that they're so close to us :) (Like, 2 miles? Maybe 3?)
@arrowned @The2ndBatgirl Yup, they got my money too.
@arrowned I approve completely. I'm ::coughs:: acquiring it now.
@tsb_says Also good. Doc would do it, unlike Joe. And everyone would roll their eyes.
@tsb_says Ha! That's possible. Stomping around and glaring, then finally grabbing Joe.
@arrowned Yes, that was what got my attention. He was probably my fave part of Decade.
@tsb_says Quick work break. Okay, Marv is cranky he's not the center of attention. What does he do when he realizes sulking isn't working?
@arrowned I can live with that. I've seen worse than TVN :D
@arrowned Ooooh, I'd be interested in that. Where would I find it?
I made so much progress on Gokaiger baby fic while talking about it here the other day, I may do that again later. I want to finish.
@Revieloutionne @RiderJetfire Headcanon accepted. ::firm nod::
Oh right. I don't get paid to sit on the couch in pajamas surfing AO3. I knew that. Right. Onward and upward. Or something.
@RiderJetfire @Revieloutionne I look forward to it :)
@Revieloutionne @RiderJetfire It was a weird line, I thought, in a very well-written show. Am I the only one who found it awkwardly phrased?
@RiderJetfire Not just you. What assumptions were people making about him being a farmer? It's a sorta weird line if it's not what we think.
@lazycocos Awww, yeah, he is like her, isn't he?
Scheduled Arrival: 6.45 pm Today
Estimated Arrival: DELAYED
@lazycocos Kasumi rocks like a rocking thing and Nagi is so adorable I want to pinch his cheeks. People are so strange. ::eyeroll::
@arrowned @Revieloutionne Fortunately, I went into Kabuto expecting insanity and I haven't been disappointed. Color me amused.
@pockysquirrel I love how *proud* he is. But not in the "I'm so awesome" way but in the "isn't it NEAT?" way. Which is why we love him.
@Revieloutionne @arrowned Yeah, not sure this one needs context other than "er, it's fish-flavored crack?"
@Revieloutionne I'm tempted to say we should show this at couchcon just on principle that we shouldn't be the only ones w/broken brains.
@Revieloutionne Aaaaand, I just got to the Iron Chef bit. This is the crackiest crack that ever cracked in crackdom.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel loud enough, I'm afraid I'll wake the kids. This is even more insane than I expected. ::falls off couch::
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel No, I think it's entirely appropriate. BTW, I had to stop watching the "dark knife" ep, b/c I'm laughing-
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne I'm rather fond of Kitaoka, even if he is an asshole. He developed a redeeming trait. Just the one, though.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne ::snerk:: Oh yes, Gou is definitely a member of the Kamen Rider Assholes Club with those guys. Although-
@Revieloutionne ::nods:: Exactly. If the movie makes me go "Eeeee!" then I consider it worth my time. Plot? Eh. Whatever.
@Revieloutionne I can see the value. It explains a lot about the giant crossover movies, methinks :D I never expect too much out of 'em
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Yes, that. If it was Tendou or Tsukasa or Kitaoka, we'd want to strangle him. But on Godai, it's cute.
@Revieloutionne Since I was expecting insanity, this is fine with me. I just got to the dark knife. I'm prepared to be amused.
@Revieloutionne I think ridiculous would be a good way to describe it. I'm amused at the insanity of Kabuto.
@macpuffins Hee. Kamen Rider Kabuto. One of the Riders is a makeup artist. Nothing beats Ultimate Makeup, y'know.
Even funnier than the cooking competition is the dueling makeup artists. "Toku means never having to say you're kidding." #kabuto
@Rivulet027 @tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl The not wearing gloves thing is often what I notice. Avi will point out other stuff I didn't see.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 @The2ndBatgirl OMG, that drives even *me* nuts! How about when they touch their face w/a gloved hand? ::facepalm::
Why did I bother to pay for a haircut when it would look just as bad if I let Avi hack off a few inches at the bottom? Hmmph.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl Oooh, there she is: 
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl ::laughs:: Okay, I buy that argument.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl Although if I drink at Couchcon, I might tell you about the first woman I had a crush on...
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl Not...exactly. I had some cute colleagues, but none of them looked like Harrison Ford.
@pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl We WISH. Alas, we tend to run more toward nerd than Harrison Ford.
@Rivulet027 @The2ndBatgirl ::laughs:: Probably, but I can't resist the urge to nitpick when it's (almost but not quite) my field.
@TerrierLee_ Ah well. I guess I can wait semi-patiently then.
@The2ndBatgirl Y'know, I was an archaeologist for about 15 years and I never met a dig with a uniform. Maybe it's a paleontology thing?
@SadieDing All I ever find is empty food wrappers. I clearly ride the wrong trains.
@TerrierLee_ wait, it's subbed? Tell me where to find it???? I need this SO MUCH.
@The2ndBatgirl Oh darn it, you just meant the second one you sent out. I'm slow today :D
@The2ndBatgirl BOTH?? Holy friggin moley. How have you not achieved spontaneous combustion yet?
@tsb_says EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! So awesome :)
@tsb_says Yeeeeees?
@The2ndBatgirl @lazycocos @gingayellow I adore Shiba Takeru and Akashi Satoru. I also love Marvelous, Alata, Hiromu...no one type is better.
@tsb_says IT'S A GREAT IDEA :D So many interesting things you could ask him. And you could tell him how much we love him #oneofus
@arrowned ::hugs:: I'm sorry to hear that :(
@Revieloutionne I ran out of space, I was going to say Kuuga and curry :D
Ryuki/Den-O: Tea/coffee-flavored crack
Kabuto: Miso-flavored crack
Wizard: Doughnut-flavored crack
Drive: Candy-flavored crack
Gaim: Fruity
@tptigger42 ::hugs:: As I said to Punk, it's easy to be misunderstood when trying to communicate in this short form.
@The2ndBatgirl @PunkPinkPower I would be more than happy for someone to write that fic :D
@PunkPinkPower ::hugs:: It's easy for misunderstandings to sometimes occur in this short form.
@pockysquirrel Oh gods yes. I can't tell you how much I need a break if I'm going to avoid killing any family members.
Aaaand, I've picked up one sick boy from school. ::sigh:: I suspect I'll have to keep him home tomorrow too :(

1. A woman who kinda looks pregnant is 
or
2. That you know the ethnic background/history…
@trollprincess They called Jay Smooth white. o_O Wow, that's awkward and stupid on a whole new and exciting level.
@tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl Awesome! Yes, all the crossovers :)
@FanToku Working, actually :D And I totally ship Mio/Hikari. And Hikari/Right. And Tokatti/Hikari. And...
@FanToku Er, I don't know, because I've never seen Frozen!
@FanToku @TerrierLee_ I tend to ship everyone with everyone in most shows. Except for Kuuga, where I only ship Godai/Ichijo.
@The2ndBatgirl Waitaminute, I didn't hear this. Who???
@FanToku @TerrierLee_ I am massively multiship and can happily ship both pairings with no cognitive dissonance :D
@TerrierLee_ My MIL, who's never had an office job in her life, is always lecturing my hubby on how to deal with work problems. ::snort::
@TerrierLee_ Awww, they're so adorable together :)
@Rivulet027 Oh, children. I'm surprised Barak never did that. No, he was more prone to painting the walls with toothpaste. ::snort::
I'm not sure what's going to happen when Tendou and Tsurugi meet, but I suspect their egos might cause some kind of explosion. o_O #kabuto
Jeez, is there anyone who *doesn't* get to use TheBee at some point in the series? Oh wait, I know...THE AWESOME WOMEN, right? #kabuto
@RiderJetfire Good for you.
@Rivulet027 Oh dear. I hate drama :(
I HAVE COUCHCON TICKETS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. I REPEAT: I HAVE COUCHCON TICKETS. I might just survive the next month. Maybe.
Sure, take Tendou, Asshole Extraordinaire (tm), on a group date. What could *possibly* go wrong? I can't imagine. ::facepalm::
So Yaguruma cooks Tendou dinner while baring his soul and there's NO FIC FOR THEM? Fandom, are you feeling okay? o_O
@chrislhayes Well, actual real, living assholes, to be technical. (Says the mother of two IVF babies.)
@LinearRanger @Yoshistunts Well, maybe half. @BrennanMejia can be the other half. Because sometimes you need two people on screen, right?
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel WOOT! Awesome :)
@pzmyers You're anti-nutmeg! You probably hate apple pie too! You horrible un-American person! ;)
@Revieloutionne Hahahaha! Okay, I officially don't care about the plot AT ALL b/c FOOD. Also "as for containers...mine is bigger."
@Revieloutionne (And yes, I *own* my kinks, thankyewverymuch.)
@Revieloutionne Woohoo! Okay, I don't care about anything else if I'm gonna get more of that :D Plot be damned, hot guys cooking!
I don't care what else happens in Kabuto...we'll always have the cooking contest. Two hot guys cooking tofu? Yes pls.
@PunkPinkPower @pockysquirrel You should have seen the three of us during the latest ep. I'm surprised nobody fell off the couch.
@PunkPinkPower @pockysquirrel Everyone feel sorry for my hubby, who's faced with his wife and both kids shrieking and flailing together.
@Revieloutionne No idea why you'd be nervous. ::whistles innocently:: I mean, it's not like anyone would notice...well, maybe they would ;)
@Revieloutionne Yeah, I'd pretty much already decided to try and make myself give Faiz a pass. I can survive a fever dream.
@Revieloutionne I've been kind of putting off this last bunch. Not sure how much of a completist I want to be.
@Revieloutionne @deepFlaw Yeah, I'm not going into this expecting genius, so I should be okay.
@Revieloutionne Ah yes, that strange empty year. ::coughs:: The only ones I haven't seen yet are Agito, Faiz, Hibiki, and Kabuto.
@deepFlaw &lt;wry&gt;Oh boy, I can't wait&lt;/wry&gt;
@Revieloutionne Oh wait, Ryuki is before Kabuto? This is what I get for watching out of order :D Yeah, some def asshole members there.
Other notable members include, of course, Decade's Tsukasa and basically everyone in Kiva.
Just started KR Kabuto. Soooo, Tendou is the founding member of the Kamen Rider Assholes Club, then?
@Revieloutionne Ha, that cracked me up :D
@macpuffins I'm glad I don't own anything of theirs, because...yeah.
@macpuffins I know you get it :D
@PunkPinkPower Yes. Yes, indeed. Fuck them, the horse they rode in on, the man who made the saddle, and the little girl who fed it apples.
Oh, and as the mother of two kids who only exist due to IVF, let me just say that Dolce &amp; Gabbana can kiss my ass. ::gives them the finger::
Barak's birthday party is over. I have talked to many many people today. I am done with people now. ::hides under bed::
@nightmere10 @plutoHimself @pockysquirrel Then whose dad, I wonder? Huh.
@plutoHimself @nightmere10 @pockysquirrel Tyler's dad, one assumes? We're not expecting any others, right? He looks...young for the role.
@tptigger42 Alas, you're destined to have this problem pretty much every season, I'm afraid. Fandom being fandom and all.
@pockysquirrel E-mail me anything you can remember! I'm desperately curious :D
@tptigger42 I was inclined toward Riley/Chase due to Souji/Ian, but I also like Tyler/Shelby. Also everyone/everyone. 'Cause I'm me.
@pockysquirrel If we don't get detailed notes from you out of this panel, I will cry. It will be pathetic and terrible.
@SonyaCraig15 @pockysquirrel Nope, guess it wasn't me, but I really did say that. :)
@SonyaCraig15 @pockysquirrel Wait, you were at the library with my son and me? Because I said that very recently :)
@PutItOnMyTabe @RangerCrew @James_JDavies Loved the delivery of that line! It cracked me up :)
@Rivulet027 I'm on DW as mara and LJ as marag :)
@BlackNerd @DansTokuRants It's absolutely srs bsnss. No question. What with the giant robot dinosaurs. And, well, Poisandra. :D
@flightrisker @jamiekilstein But I thought @wilw was the burrito tweet guy. I'm so confused by this newfangled social media!
I need to write #dinocharge fic. Taking prompts if anyone has 'em. Stories prob won't be done for a while unless I'm REALLY inspired, but...
@Yoshistunts Loved it! The ending was pretty much the best thing ever and the whole episode was a great lesson for kids (and grownups too!).
BEST EPISODE ENDING EVER. I want to watch that a million times. They're playing and training and being too cute! #powerrangers #dinocharge
And what assumptions did people make about you, Riley? ::looks innocent:: #powerrangers #dinocharge
"Ain't that the tooth." OHNOTHEYDIDN'T I still like "Monster. Extinct." though. #powerrangers #dinocharge
Unmorphed fighting! Riley's protecting Chase! Teamwork! "Don't force it, hot shot." #powerrangers #dinocharge
Note to self: Call dentist again and reschedule that appt that got snowed out. See, good lessons from #powerrangers #dinocharge
@tptigger42 Yeah, I'm now reminded that I'm due for a cleaning.
@TerrierLee_ Inorite? We have trouble recognizing it, since it's been so long since we saw an actual mentor mentoring...
@DansTokuRants A great lesson for the kids. I hope they're listening.
And Keeper's being a mentor again!!! OMGHOWAWESOME!!! #powerrangers #dinocharge
"You can't skate in here." Love that Riley shows his age there. Nice reading of the line. #powerrangers #dinocharge
@TerrierLee_ You mean like GOOD WRITING? How can that be? (I'm so happy, yo. This is exactly what I wanted from this season.)
Oh! I love the way they're using the sentai footage here. And I love the character interactions SO MUCH. #powerrangers #dinocharge
Awww, that was an adorable spat between Riley and Chase. The kind of tension you might see in a new team. #powerrangers #dinocharge
"Needs more vinegar." Bwahahahahahahaha! She just pranked Fury. #powerrangers #dinocharge
She wants a disgusting cake for her wedding. Oooookay. Just a bit odd, sweetie. #powerrangers #dinocharge
Ready to livetweet #powerrangers #dinocharge! I liked this Kyoryuger ep, so I look forward to seeing what they do with it here :)
@Rivulet027 She's just the tiniest bit afraid right now, since she's the reason the baby threw up on Marvelous. Gai may blurt something out
@Rivulet027 I'm doing the whole thing from Marv's POV, so I can't show that. But I could hint at it from their behavior when Marv emerges.
@Rivulet027 Bwahahahahaha! Oh, that might even be better than having Joe try to talk him out of his sulk! I'll ponder this :)
@Rivulet027 Hmm, I wonder if Joe lets him sulk or comes after him. I think he might just need that sulk...
Yes, as my previous tweets prove, over half my fics aren't plotted in advance. I just stick characters in a room and see what happens.
@Rivulet027 Alas, I need to clean for Barak's bday party, so I'll have to see what happens later. Marv can sulk in his room 'til then :D
@Rivulet027 That's pretty much what Marvelous sees. It's not actually happening that way, but hey, it's Marvelous.
Hmm. Or it might work. I won't know until Joe gets there. He's not great at words but he does know his captain, so...maybe?
The baby spit up on Marvelous' shirt. The crew is sending Joe to calm him down. Proving they're not always as smart as they think ::wince::
@Revieloutionne ::snerk:: Yes, exactly. I think Ahim and Luka are about to school him. No idea where this is going to go. Oy vey.
@Rivulet027 Yeah, it def feels right. It just kind of derails where I was going with the fic. Who knows what'll happen next.
My daughter and her friends are dealing with a bully by...writing a letter to the school counselor. I'm the proudest mommy in the universe.
Gokaiger have a baby (temporarily!). Joe adoringly thinks she's wonderful. Marv is jealous. I didn't see that coming until I got there o_O
I managed to write a few grafs of the accidental baby acquisition fic! Too bad we need to leave for shul in 15 min. Ugh. KILLMENOWPLS.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel They're particularly well-suited to it. They're just so...adorable. You can *see* them picking out curtains.
@pockysquirrel I just really need some happy people who love each other (platonically or romantically) being together. That would be amazing
@pockysquirrel Random ideas for any: housework, eating dinner together, going shopping. (Huh. Apparently I'm in the mood for curtainfic)
@pockysquirrel Oh man, anything happy would be great for me. Silly Dino Charge gen or fluff for Ichijou/Godai or Antonio/Jayden?
@pockysquirrel I *almost* managed a PWP. Sorta? 
Trying to write a Godai/Ichijou PWP. It's developing feels but I think I may manage to avoid plot for once. Maybe? Sneaky plots.
@tptigger42 Alas, the printables there are still Megaforce :(
My google-fu is failing me. I've found tons of PR coloring pages for B's bday party this Sunday but not Dino Charge. Anyone?
@pockysquirrel o_O I just don't understand people sometimes. I really don't.
@pockysquirrel It's amazing how aliens/robots/whatever are "male" or "female" when it's convenient but not when we want to slash them, hmm?
@TerrierLee_ ::happy sigh:: Yes. Those two make me gleeful :)
@pockysquirrel Alas, I think we need to write it ourselves. But every time I try, I end up with adorableness. Which is nice, but...ACK.
@pockysquirrel OMG IF ONLY I KNEW.
@pockysquirrel Heh. We broke you, didn't we? Whoops? Sorry! (Not sorry.)
@pockysquirrel Feeeeels! (I need to rewatch that, it's been too long.)
@justshai o_O Wow. That's impressive.
@justshai Can you be alive with a number like that??
@Revieloutionne Screenshots? I need to take some screenshots of Shu in this movie...
@Revieloutionne Huh, I can kind of see that in this pic. Not as much in the rest of the movie, though.
@RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel I get it. And fuck yes. I love him as Eiji in OOO but in this movie there's just something...whew.
@RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel I don't, but I can guess :D He could do just about anything to me. ::brain dribbles out of ears::
@pockysquirrel @RiderJetfire Oh it's def. coming along :) But when I say the fansub is bad...
@RiderJetfire @pockysquirrel Why? I mean, look at who you're talking to. You can't possibly think we'd be bothered or embarrassed, do you?
@RiderJetfire Mm-hmm. Despite the dreadful translation I'm enjoying the movie a lot. I would buy this if it was legally available.
@Yoshistunts Absolutely ridiculous attitude. I want to see casts that are inclusive and look like the real world, not white bread.
FYI: There's probably something hotter out there than Watanabe Shu in the Hero Next movie "Piece," but...I doubt it. 
@The2ndBatgirl Guh. I just...guh. Mrfl sporfle guh.

Someone has wised up over at Saban, huh?
@The2ndBatgirl asdfjhlajwerhul$*kasrghj

::stares::
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Oh gods, his book about the stupidity of war. And the one about how money is all in our heads. Wow.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Oh believe me, I know! But do your best. Which is pretty much what PTerry would say too. Just do your best.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I found his books somewhat late myself, but his eye for how people think/believe/act was unparalleled.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Start now. He would have absolutely understood :) But oh gods, so good. So optimistic *and* realistic.
@tsb_says "No, thank you, I already have a penguin" is the only possible answer to that question.
@pockysquirrel I...oh gods, no. No no no. Damn it, now I'm crying again. He wrote the way I always wished I could write :(
Oh yeah, if I'm tired I should sleep, shouldn't I? Also, if I was hungry, I should probably have eaten something. ::sigh:: Bed now.
Wah. Gokaiger baby fic will have to wait for better mental health on my part :( Can apparently only write angsty stuff right now.
@pockysquirrel @secretrangerfan I have absolutely no idea who you're talking about. Speaking of which...::goes back to Gokaiger fic::
@Revieloutionne Very, now that you point it out. I had wondered about that particular word.
@pockysquirrel You're prob safe with jeans (preferably tight) and some kind of funky top OR a plaid shirt. That covers most Riders, I think.
@tsb_says Woot! Alas, mine (correctly) insists I go see the psychologist a couple of times :( Don't wanna spend money and time, but...yeah.
@TerrierLee_ @pockysquirrel As long as you guys enjoy it :)
@pockysquirrel @TerrierLee_ 
@TerrierLee_ I don't know, but that always happens to me too. I guess it probably is some kind of reaction to our skin?
Barak got a Dino Charge megazord for his birthday and he says it's "AWESOME!" And he loves the pink zord as much as blue or red. Crazy, huh?
@pockysquirrel @TerrierLee_ Oh myyyyyyyyy. ::considers:: I'll see what I can do.
@TerrierLee_ I'm not bothered by a few things (baka, henshin) but for whatever reason, people leaving in "arigato" drives me NUTS.
@TerrierLee_ Holy moley, some people on the Pit of Voles put in whole sentences! (I know, if I'm reading fic there, I get what I deserve.)
@SallyStrange It's also possible that it's an abortion effect, though. I am not a doctor and all that :)
@SallyStrange Mmm, yeah, it's some of the same hormones, but not all of them. I think that an actual pregnancy has a bigger physical effect.
@SallyStrange ::snort:: That would be kinda funny! I can't vouch for post-abortion, but pregnancy hormones can change things, so...maybe?
@tsb_says I was thinking that I've clearly been watching too much Drive :D Or maybe Barak was watching RPM the other day?
@tsb_says Seriously, no guarantees, of course, but this is def w/in my writing skill set if I can get my brain in gear.
@tsb_says He's really good at napping with the baby, but not much else. Gai's best at feeding. Doc builds gadgets.
@tsb_says Also, Doc probably builds the baby an elaborate swing with a crazy mobile. It sings. And who knows what else.
@tsb_says There will probably be milk spit up on Marvelous' coat. I hope everyone can handle that ;)
@tsb_says Bwahahaha! Okay, I'll see what I can do :) I knew being a parent would come in handy for fic someday...
Seriously, people, put prompts on the Sentai meme. You've got a 50/50 chance of me filling it if I know the season! 
@Revieloutionne @RiderJetfire They *totally* did have a casting agent. B/c wow...I recognize a lot of people. You should resist, though.
@RiderJetfire Y'know how reading TVTropes leads you down a rabbit hole? Fanfic does the same to me sometimes. Thus...Prince of Tennis.
@RiderJetfire Mine is "Do Your Best" from the Prince of Tennis musical, so hey, we're all about the "no shame" thing here.
@justshai ::hugs:: I'm sorry, I know that really sucks :(
@TerrierLee_ Do you want prompts? Or to brainstorm? 'Cause I'd love to read something for them :)
@TerrierLee_ Yeah, I also have some weird feels about which words can be untranslated. (For me, it's in fic, not manga.)
The Gaorangers in pajamas: Cutest thing ever? y/y/awwwwww? (Also, I ship Black/Blue even *more* here than in PRWF.)
@Revieloutionne @TokuLadies_Pod By coincidence, I crashed and slept through it too, but I agree :)
@pockysquirrel I love them all. I don't think I could possibly choose a favorite at this point. Except maybe Grandpa.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel See, since I don't care that much about the appearance of the suits, I was happy with the ep :)
@TokuLadies_Pod I miss LJ fandom, though, for long-form discussion. I wish people would come back to LJ/DW and rant with me.
@TokuLadies_Pod I know you're shocked but: fic. Sharing fic and headcanons and playing with the canon to make it what we want. Community.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I think I was halfway or more before I really got attached? But yeah, no show is for everyone.
@Rivulet027 Now, I think iTunes is more evil than Amazon. It eats my password EVERY SINGLE TIME.
@tsb_says Done. I need cookies now. ::goes off to find Girl Scout cookies in the kitchen::
@tsb_says Hell, he managed to add the megazord three times and getting him to the page to change the quantity took us like 10 minutes.
OMG, stuck on the phone listening to my parents try to figure out how to buy something off Amazon. Pls to be killing me now?
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl Well, it worked on me. And you were right about Kuuga too, so no worries :)
@trollprincess YES. Avi is unemployed but darn it, I can go to the doctor and get my Zoloft. And the kids can get their physicals.
@tsb_says I am so unspooned today it's not even funny :(
plots and contrived romances and men who talk about their feelings, but JFC, get your medicine right! Drives me up the wall.
Typical that the thing that would annoy me in a fic is the character with the flu being given antibiotics. I can handle the most improbable-
That feeling when iTunes plays the Boukenger theme followed by the Operation Overdrive theme and then your head explodes.
o_O I mean, there's lots of differences, but my Jayden is so Tim Drake with his perfectionism and denying he has any personal needs.
Just realized: When I write Antonio/Jayden, I'm writing Dick/Tim. Happy outgoing returning guy trying to charm emotionally constipated guy.
@justshai Too late! I always go down that avenue, as it happens.
@RiderJetfire ::laughs:: I yearn to be someone's private editor. I did enjoy the review, though :)
@Revieloutionne That line...Barak and I both burst out in hysterical laughter. Both the line and the delivery were perfect.
@MorbySa @tsb_says I haven't watched it yet. I look forward to hearing your opinion, since I already know hers :D
@tptigger42 Oh good grief. Why am I even surprised at this crap by now? I need to start assuming the worst so I can be pleasantly surprised.
@Rivulet027 Excellent taste!
@Marvey_Chan --has a thing for Kaoru. (Because he's in my brain.) He idolizes her and I think he might be willing to be more honest with her
@Marvey_Chan Oh, I ship him with the entire team. And every other sentai ever. But who would he trust with a deep secret? Joe. And my Marv--
I think it happened pre-Red Pirates. Tempting to make it something Basco did but I don't think Basco would have done it before betrayal
want to write it happening, but someone making him talk about it. Also, I've had a nebulous reason in my head and I need to clarify it.
Might finally write the fic explaining why Marv is freaked out by handcuffs. But who would he tell the story to? Joe? Kaoru? I kinda don't--
@pockysquirrel Awesome! I can't let Barak see this or I'll never hear the end of it. He's already cranky he only got TWO bday presents today
@RiderJetfire Oh gods, I can't help it...in the first sentence it should be "penchant" not "pentitent" :) ::goes back to enjoying review::
@pockysquirrel ::nods:: Exactly. The six-year-old loved this episode and did lots of bouncing and cheering, so that's a win :)
Did they just say "Let's barbecue this chicken?" Well, Barak thought it was hilarious. #powerrangers #dinocharge
I love Koda's "So easy for him. I froze in a glacier for thousands of years." Bwahahahaha! I'd be pissed too. #powerrangers #dinocharge
Wait, is that Keeper actually being a *mentor*? And providing useful information?? How exciting! #powerrangers #dinocharge
Love me some skateboard stunts. And that's a pretty good jump to the sentai footage. #powerrangers #dinocharge
"Chase, you must stay alert at all times." No, that's not foreshadowing at *all* .#powerrangers #dinocharge
@Revieloutionne I worry about this myself. This is why I use so many ellipses...
@settiai Am I a bad person if "scaring the Jehovah's Witnesses" is one of my favorite games? :D (Don't answer that.)
@mizzelle Inorite? I can hardly believe it myself :)
Happy birthday to my little guy, Barak, who turns 6 today :) It's been quite a ride so far and I look forward to the rest.
@justshai Really? The hospital my kids were born at did. There were exceptions, of course.
Evite sent out the wrong date for B's birthday party and directed Saba to the wrong wish list. I need to get him a refund. Hell.
@BurgundyRanger I've got my fingers crossed for PMC5 but it seems unlikely I'll make it without a miracle. And a really good babysitter.
@BurgundyRanger Hey neighbor! I'm also in the MD suburbs. I'm not much of a con-goer, but I have local friends who work for Katsucon.
@Marvey_Chan And further, may I add my total amusement at how the series is basically an "everybody is gay" fanfic? Love it.
@lazycocos o_O I don't know why I'm even surprised by this. Also, I agree with what you said below about Magiranger!
@Marvey_Chan Oh gods, yes. I'm *reading fic on the Pit of Voles* is how bad I've got it for that series. ::facepalm::
No, Mara, you *can't* watch Ai No Kotodama again instead of working, even if Tokuyama Hidenori and Saito Yasuka are super adorable.
@tsb_says Er, I worked a *lot* more than that and I'm a part-timer.
@BurgundyRanger Or as @tptigger42 suggested, it could be one of the new Rangers. We do have a bunch left to introduce.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I can handle that. Kiva...will live on in my memory as the definition of WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS FUCKERY?
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel That's what I was afraid of ;) I'll probably watch it anyway, unless you tell me it's Kiva bad or Gaim bad.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I have low standards. If it can avoid women in refrigerators, I'm probably okay. ;)
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel I haven't seen Agito, so I have no opinion there :)
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Which boggles my mind, b/c I wouldn't let 6yo Barak watch it for at least a year or two.
@pockysquirrel Oh gods yes.
@Rivulet027 Aww :( Get some rest, then!
@Revieloutionne @lazycocos Ah, if it's the same writer as Den-O then I have to agree. I enjoyed Den-O but there was a lot of "huh?"
@lazycocos I understand hating them for that reason! I agree that the show has more respect for Shelby. ::fingers crossed::
@lazycocos I know! I expected to hate it b/c of the stupidity of Daigo/Amy. If it can say subtle and grow naturally, it'll be okay.
@pockysquirrel ::nods:: That would be interesting. But I would want it separate from regular PR, b/c Kuuga isn't for kids, y'know?
@tptigger42 that's possible too!
@TerrierLee_ I'm assuming they meant Riley.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel That's a really good point! He's so self-effacing, he assumes nobody would want to call him.
@pockysquirrel Oh that poor boy. He has a terrible case of foot in mouth disease, although he means well.
@TerrierLee_ @pockysquirrel And the best part is how that's not even CLOSE to the slashiest scene :D
@pockysquirrel I don't recall how many times it happens, but I *think* there's at least one more? It's a strange error.
@pockysquirrel I think he makes that same mistake multiple times. Presumably he's worried he might miss a call from Godai.
@arrowned @darkesword Ugh, good luck! The roads look kinda gross but since the snow has stopped the major roads should all be plowed soon.
@pockysquirrel Yes. I thoroughly approve of puppy piles. Lots of puppy piles. Puppy piles forever!
@tptigger42 Yeah, I have that problem with caffeine too. Sometimes sugar will wake me up without making me hyper?
@pockysquirrel Huh. I've lived on the East Coast most of my life. I don't recall if I bought the cookies when we lived in LA.
@pockysquirrel A Caramel *what*? Samoas all the way. Best cookie ever.
@tsb_says Thank Darwin! Now I just have to survive the snow and Passover :D
@tsb_says Also, it's still snowing heavily here. I expect at least another inch or two before we're done.
@tsb_says Gaosilver getting his motorcycle is a special effect worthy of kids discovering mimes on elevators :D This is a special ep, indeed
Shoveled 6-8 inches of snow. Watching Gaoranger w/a cup of cocoa in hand. Karaoke Org? Meow access? o_O Are there drugs in my cocoa?
@Marvey_Chan I'm too old to have watched it first-run as a kid, but I watched repeats with my kids and I LOVE the Kratt brothers :)
@trollprincess I highly recommend it. If you were local, I'd drag you to the Purim shpiel. Also, everyone should love hamantaschen.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel I absolutely support all of these. Pink *might* be Hufflepuff too?
@trollprincess Purim is totally the best holiday EVER. One year our cantor sang every chapter to a different rock/folk song tune.
@Rivulet027 YAY! GOOD FOR YOU!
Oh look. A snow day for the kids. Yay.
@Revieloutionne ::giggles:: You can tell how sleepy I am by how likely I am to make jokes about the word "coming". I'm going to sleep now.
There I was, writing a sweet gen ficlet for the Sentai prompt meme and suddenly...sex happened. o_O I did not see that coming (so to speak).
@Revieloutionne I think you did, but I'd forgotten. I had to squint to see it, but I suck at recognizing actors in other shows.
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel ::nods:: OMG yes, I loved all the police. I want ALL THE FIC about them.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel In the sense that secretly means screaming from the rooftops while waving a rainbow flag. I'm just sayin' ;)
@pockysquirrel It gets much much much higher. I wouldn't show this one to Barak for a couple of years at the very earliest.
@pockysquirrel Heh. You're beginning to glimpse why they're my OTP of OTPs. It gets SO MUCH BETTER. The hospital...the jogging...:D
Gaoranger/Wild Force are not my favorite seasons, but you have to admit GaoMadillo/the Armadillo Zord are the cutest things ever.
@The2ndBatgirl Well, I make no guarantees (which is why I didn't sign up) but if you e-mail your prompts/characters, I can try!
@Chrislee12 @TokuLadies_Pod Exactly. Which is why I'm not shaking an admonishing finger at you for liking it :) You acknowledge the flaws.
@Chrislee12 @TokuLadies_Pod ::nods:: They're the reason I kept watching. I really did like them and I wanted good things for them.
@Chrislee12 @TokuLadies_Pod Well, we all love what we love, y'know? I love problematic things too.
@ashleycstj @arrowned Right! He figures his cousins won't know where Scotland is, so he simplifies. Like Americans are all "Oh, Asia."
@ashleycstj @arrowned Well, y'know people outside the UK can never remember there's a difference, so maybe Yakumo was just being lazy ;)
@arrowned @TokuLadies_Pod Yeah, Kiva was what a friend of mine calls the "special kind of special." I feel better having ranted, though.
@tptigger42 I can't IMAGINE trying to date. I sucked at it in college and I can't think I've gotten better at it.
@RiderJetfire @The2ndBatgirl ::pats head:: There there, child. It's going to be okay. I'll bake you cookies :)
@tptigger42 It sounds weird to me too and it's my life. SMH.
@arrowned @pockysquirrel Seriously. Even my *kids* are getting tired of snow! Yael is pissed she'll miss art class tomorrow.
@tptigger42 Married to my college boyfriend! Started dating in 1990, married in 1996, years of infertility, Yael was born in 2005 :)
@tptigger42 @RiderJetfire @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel I have a 10-year-old daughter, Shamus :) I was born in *1971*! I remember the 80s!
@pockysquirrel @arrowned I'm hiding under the bed and pretending the Thursday snow doesn't exist. Because reasons.
@RiderJetfire @tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel Hahaha! You're so adorable. I'm 43 :) And yes, I vote for a directory to keep track
@lazycocos And me! I only need a few, I swear.
@pockysquirrel @RiderJetfire And I'm still older nyah ;)
@jameshaning @Rivulet027 Oh look, just when I was developing some faith in humanity, boom, there it goes.
@Rivulet027 @TerrierLee_ Yes. There's nothing like the ability to clean any clothing or sheets or towels whenever you want with no quarters.
@justshai Purim. Trust me, it's Purim ;) If it's not the hamantaschen, it's the shpiel.
@TerrierLee_ Washer/dryer outweighs almost EVERYTHING. Having lived in two dorms and four apartments, and bought a house...trust me, I know.
@PunkPinkPower That's so sweet :)
@Revieloutionne The brain you tried to reach has MELTED INTO GOO. Please try again later, when thoughts of mostly naked DC actors are gone.
@pockysquirrel ::stares:: :drool:: ::stares:: ::drools more:: We're gonna die, but what a way to go.
@tsb_says eventually Nate would take him aside and they'd talk about...stuff. Parker would probably punch Conner at least once, though.
@tsb_says I don't know why, but it seems like Eliot would take Trent under his wing. Conner would irritate everyone mostly, but-
@tsb_says Kira and Parker is possibly the most wonderfully terrifying idea ever. Nate would hate Tommy. He would want to throttle him.
@tsb_says -WTF are you doing there? And Ethan's like "But he's just the hot gamer, what's going on???"
@tsb_says OMG PLS PLS PLS. You would brighten my day 10,000%! Can they each try to hack the other person? And Hayley calls Ethan and is all-
@MarronMarvel I understand!
@MarronMarvel Heh. Sorry to hear that :D
@tsb_says ::sigh:: Yeah. And fortunately this wasn't an emergency appt or anything, just a checkup. I'm just mentally swamped.
@tsb_says I don't blame him for charging me. Doctors should totally do that to idiots like me! I just hate being an idiot :(
Aaaaand, I just missed my psychiatrist appt b/c I thought it was Thursday and I'm an idiot. Bye bye money! I hate being a grownup :(
@tsb_says I wanna. I don't wanna be a grownup anymore. I don't like it.
@tsb_says We're getting more snow and ice. And then some more snow and ice. Ugh.
@seananmcguire Pre-ordered months ago! Now if you could just tell my boss I can't work today, I could *read* it :)
@pockysquirrel Oh yeah. ::writes their names and draws hearts and flowers around them::
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Y'all should know I don't OTP and I'll write any damn bizarre pairing I feel like. Godai/Ichijou is my OTP.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel ::points:: Yes, that. Seriously, I'll die of shock if you're not capslocking at us by midway at the latest.
@justshai ::facepalm:: Anyway, I've got a gigantic book of Jewish names and if you have a specific word or idea, I can ask my MIL for help.
@pockysquirrel Trying? I think SUCCEEDING is more apropos. He's the adorablest.
@pockysquirrel Oh it gets so wonderfully gay. ::cackles:: Give it some time. It's got a very different style than what you've seen so far.
Barak rewatching "Lost &amp; Found in Translation". Is it sad I'm still annoyed they cut out Bucky kissing Yukito? Yokky as Irish still rocks.
I'm getting SO MUCH work done while Yael is having a temper tantrum and Barak is waiting "patiently" for me to read him a book. ::sigh::
@MorbySa @Revieloutionne I'm very glad I don't collect toys. Bad enough having to buy them for my kids :D
@MorbySa @Revieloutionne Er, I think you may be missing the point of "not needing" :D
@pockysquirrel Well, I enjoyed it a lot but it's not my first priority as a recommendation :)
@trollprincess Yeeeah. I wouldn't be proud of voting for confused and ignorant people. Nor would I be proud to be one.
@trollprincess I just explained this to my 10-year-old and she understood it. Is Congress dumber than my daughter? (Answer: Yes!)
@tsb_says Mama Mara says rest and watch ToQger. ::nods firmly:: If you feel better later, you can unpack.
Survived Yael's b-day party despite ice storm. One emotional crisis but it was neither caused by my children nor done to them, so...yay?
@tsb_says @Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Oh, my love for Shinkenger is very very strong. ::happy sigh::
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel  True true, these are excellent things :D
@pockysquirrel @tsb_says Ah, didn't know you've seen Goseiger :) But I love everything on your poll but Garo (which I don't know)
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel I dunno, I'd probably suggest Dekaranger before Magiranger. Or Goseiger? I mean, I love Magiranger, but I dunno.
@pockysquirrel Oh look, two votes for Kuuga. So I and @Revieloutionne have voted, then. ::coughs::
@trollprincess I...but...that...o_O All I can manage is "Pot? Meet kettle."
It's okay. Feel free to stand RIGHT IN FRONT of the library and talk business loudly. I don't mind AT ALL. ::turns up music in headphones::
@Rivulet027 It was that t-shirt site that had a discount: 
@tptigger42 But why do the marketers believe that just *including* Pink will be a disaster? Do they REALLY believe it makes little boys gay?
@tptigger42 Well, I can't think of any other reason why Pink gets left off so much other merch (including my shirt, damn it).
@pockysquirrel @plutoHimself ::giggles madly:: C'mon, can you really blame us? Wouldn't you have done the same thing?
@Revieloutionne I can imagine. I liked that they acted like jealous *college students* rather than *jealous 13YO girls*. That was nice.
@Revieloutionne And it even had a love triangle that didn't make me want to claw my eyes out! That's a miracle right there.
@pockysquirrel I'm pretty sure both dad and grandpa are going to brighten my life enormously :) Annoying dorks, gotta love 'em!
@Revieloutionne Okay, thank you, that was totally the adorableness and sexiness I needed this afternoon :) I'll gladly take similar recs!
@plutoHimself I'm watching it on youtube: 
@Revieloutionne I can just edit that out in my brain. For those two...I'll manage ;)
@plutoHimself Maybe people think having a Pink on his shirt will make his penis fall off? I'll let you know, but I'm betting not.
@Revieloutionne OMG, WHERE DO I FIND THIS???
Barak's new Dino Charge shirt arrived. It includes the Pink Ranger. I'll let you know if that turns him into a girl or something.
@BurgundyRanger @Odot92 @nightmere10 I watched Kyoryuger first (and *loved* it) but it's not spoiling Dino Charge for me. Yay, Dino Charge!
@tptigger42 Children's Guide to Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals. Also 1992, lots of drawings and info. He'd def have this one!
@tptigger42 Dinosaur Valley by Mitsuhiro Kurokawa, from 1992. Story of a day in the life of dinos PLUS bonus info about excavation.
@tptigger42 My copy has a date of 2005, so I'd fudge it. BEST BOOK. It's all about how science is self-correcting.
@tptigger42 If you tell me the latest pub date you're thinking, I'll get some names off Barak's shelf.
@tptigger42 There's a lot of Time/Life type "Encyclopedia of Dinosaur" things. If you google, I'm sure you can find one that's the right age
@tptigger42 My dino-obsessed son will pick out absolutely *anything* that says dinosaur on it or has an appropriate picture.
@tptigger42 Huh, I thought it was older, it's actually from 2008. It's *such* a good book for a kid like him, though.
@tptigger42 Hmm, I can name you lots of *current* dino books. There's an older one called something like "Boy were we wrong about dinosaurs"
How does #powerrangers #dinocharge keep getting better? Loved this ep :)
@tptigger42 Sorry, if there was a Watsonian explanation, I missed it. Anyone else know?
@pockysquirrel Awwww, I like that. Headcanon accepted.
And the kid teaching Koda how to ride a bike is adorable beyond belief. Barak thinks that's funny. #powerrangers #dinocharge
@tptigger42 Because reasons? Because footage?
"How can he stay in the air that long?" Barak asks. "Maybe these are stuntmen. Oh yeah, these are stuntmen."
@pockysquirrel I yelled "Go, Koda!" at that :)
@BurgundyRanger @PowerRangers Yes. There is much squeeing and bouncing and loving. And that's not even counting my 5-year-old son :D
@The2ndBatgirl I think 95% of this show might be pulled directly from your id. Or mine, it's difficult to tell. #powerrangers #dinocharge
Awww, the kid is teaching Koda how to use the phone! And Koda misses his little brother. Wah. #powerrangers #dinocharge
@plutoHimself Well sure, but Barak is only five, so he's not quite there yet :)
Yay, Koda gets to learn that he *is* smart and awesome! #powerrangers #dinocharge
@pockysquirrel ::looks totally innocent:: I'm absolutely not imagining Chase teaching him other things.
"Why doesn't he morph?" Barak asks. "But I like that the monsters wait for them to morph." #powerrangers #dinocharge
@pockysquirrel I'll admit I squeed quietly when I saw Luckiero :)
"At least he knows the word 'and'" Barak says. "He's angry because the monster caught his friend!" #powerrangers #dinocharge
@The2ndBatgirl Favorite indeed. ::so adorable::
I'm so glad Riley called Chase on "riding kangaroos" b/c I whimpered. #powerrangers #dinocharge
And once again, they give us shirtless Koda because they love us. But they don't love Shelby's phone #powerrangers #DinoCharge
Awww, Koda has a nightmare. Poor baby :( #powerrangers #dinocharge
Ready to livetweet today's ep of #powerrangers #dinocharge! Anyone with me? I've got Barak here this week :)
@Revieloutionne @lazycocos Okay, that's good to know. So I'm prepared for it to make zero sense :D I can handle that better than Kiva.
@Revieloutionne @lazycocos Is it a ride like Kiva where I'll rant and cry or a ride like Decade where I'll shrug at the end?
@BurgundyRanger Lots, I'm sure. That always makes me giggle. (Also, is that the only time a *male* character who should be Dr. was Mr.?)
@lazycocos @Revieloutionne ::drools:: Go-on Gold. ::drools more:: ::makes mental note to watch Kabuto::
@lazycocos No, not so much with a polite way to say that ;)
Rocky's been attacked by the Pollinator. I'm just going to leave that statement there and back away slowly. #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel ::iz ded:: Oh gods, how many kids have ever seen one of those? Mine haven't!
Hasn't everyone accidentally created a metal-eating plant while creating hybrids in high school? #powerrangers
"Oh the humanity of it all! Will this torment never end?" I don't *always* love Bulk and Skull, but sometimes... #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel Of course, don't they *always* morph in the middle of town? B/c people in #powerrangers towns are apparently blind. And deaf.
@tptigger42 @purplestripe66 Excellent point :)
I just noticed...they have entire greenhouse for their junior botanical society? Most school would be lucky to have a closet. #powerrangers
I mean yes, I know, I'm complaining about bad science in a #powerrangers episode so...yeah, I'll stop complaining now :D
This is me completely ignoring the insane science of this episode :) #powerrangers
A little more livetweeting, this time a wacky plants episode of #powerrangers Zeo. More random livetweeting...
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 @purplestripe66 I'm ready.
@tptigger42 @purplestripe66 @pockysquirrel Possibly a little :) But I'll watch whatever y'all choose.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Don't we all, dearie? Don't we all?
@tptigger42 @purplestripe66 @Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel I"m in for another one!
How much do I love #powerrangers Jungle Fury? Sooooo much. Definitely one of my favorite season! Pizza, fun, great characters...
I love watching RJ fight almost as much as I love watching RJ say confusing things to Dai Shi :D #powerrangers
It's possible I tear up a bit every time I see RJ come to save his dad. "You mess w/my dad, you mess w/ me." #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 ::coughs:: I don't know *any* parents like that. ::looks innocent::
@tptigger42 Well, meddling yes, but definitely trying to make things right because he's a good person :) #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 Yep, but in a believable way, y'know? Like, he really meant well even while screwing RJ up  #powerrangers
And now Casey shows how much he's growing up by coming to try and patch things up between RJ and his dad! #PowerRangers
@tptigger42 Oh, it hasn't shown up yet. I think that belongs to the sixth ranger.
@tptigger42 The sunglasses are pretty much the best morpher except the upcoming Ninninger burger morpher :D
The "is my dad gone?" bit is still the funniest bit ever. And then it goes to Casey hurting RJ's feelings accidentally again #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel I totally believed their relationship from the very first moment
@Rivulet027 Yes, it's a reminder that Casey is still young, y'know? He's so excited and happy that he's not seeing RJ. #PowerRangers
Oh gods, this father/son scene always makes me both laugh and cringe with how perfectly true and real it is. #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel Good point! I never thought about that. Does that happen in any other season? ::ponders::
@pockysquirrel That's three of us who just posted that quote :D
@tptigger42 And I love that we both said pretty much exactly the same thing :)
"Six horses, a toilet plunger, and a wireless mouse." Seriously, RJ is the BEST. #powerrangers
@pockysquirrel The loft is so adorable and perfect and I love the pizza parlor :) Just...this whole season makes me happy.
RJ: best mentor or absolute best mentor? #powerrangers
Woot! Starting #PowerRangers Jungle Fury now. I love these adorable dorks SO MUCH.
@tptigger42 @purplestripe66 @Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel Yep
@tptigger42 ::sigh:: I think that's a battle that's already lost. Everyone else considers it PR so...we're stuck.
@justshai Just not what we love Power Rangers for :)
@tptigger42 @purplestripe66 @Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel Too late!
The ladies and I are getting ready to livetweet an ep of #powerrangers Jungle Fury b/c we want to take back the hashtag from dark and gritty
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel @purplestripe66 ::squints:: I've got Skype for IM that I use for work? How do the cool kids IM today?
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel @purplestripe66 I'm gonna make myself a cup of cocoa...
@Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel @purplestripe66 @tptigger42 Would it help if we waited half an hour? I could be sure the kids were *asleep*.
@pockysquirrel I need to go force the children into bed. Here's hoping they stay there. For once.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 @MorbySa @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @purplestripe66 That's a great ep! I may or may not be on depending on kids.
@txvoodoo @trollprincess @skywaterblue @gabydunn I'll bring rugelach and rainbow cookies. The good ones, because he deserves that.
@tptigger42 @The2ndBatgirl Yes, he really was awesome. I was moved by his talk. I really did laugh and cry and all those good things.
@RangerCommandPH @trekkieb47 It was my first fandom too. My father and I watched Star Trek together and it shaped me in profound ways.
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel I have to survive Pesach first and that...is a tricky proposition. The guilt and PITA is strong w/family.
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel Yes. I'd like to think March is going to be better, but history doesn't bear me out on that.
@pockysquirrel So. Fucking. Done. I'm just gonna go off and cry for a bit. Glad I got to hear him speak about Judaism and Star Trek...
@The2ndBatgirl I just saw too. Wah :( I'm glad I got to hear him speak at a nearby shul a few years ago. He was wonderful and warm and funny
@WatcherMark @The2ndBatgirl Haruto/doughnuts 4eva! Totally my OTP ;)
@tsb_says Yep, Kaito is the hot thief and that was definitely the only good part. But I wasn't expecting the movie to be good, so it's okay.
@tsb_says Yes, both would be good. Someone should do that for us.
@justshai Aaaaand, we'd like that too. ::hugs::
@Revieloutionne I'm sure makeup sex was involved. Also, did Kaito seriously create the Big Machine b/c his boyfriend was MEAN to him?
@plutoHimself @pockysquirrel I looked it up quickly b/c I didn't remember it either! It's worth watching for completionist purposes.
@pockysquirrel @plutoHimself I don't remember it being awful. Dumb in the way Xmas specials so often are, but not painfully bad.
After watching Super Hero Taisen, I either need ALL the Marvelous/Joe makeup fic or ALL the Kaito/Joe fic. Why isn't there more???
@plutoHimself @pockysquirrel Definitely not the only one. Remain unspoiled if you can, Pocky. I think it's worth it.
@pockysquirrel @plutoHimself Um...yeah. Yeah, there is. And I'm not going to spoil it either, even with the super obvious joke. ::coughs::
--to Kaito, "Come home, idiot." Anyway, the movie was as pointless and pretty as I expected, so that's fine.
Good thing I didn't expect Super Hero Taisen to make sense. But this movie made Kaito/Joe canon, right? Also, I wanted Tsukasa to say--
Got spoiled. I've got the OT sub of Fourze but for some reason my Super Hero Taisen dl is T-N and...well, yeah. "Space kitaaaaaa"? Really?
@Morphin_K @secretrangerfan @trekkieb47 Sorry! I don't actually think him being Asian is racist, but he's not necessarily a Neanderthal
@Morphin_K @secretrangerfan @trekkieb47 master's in anthropology is almost as ancient as Koda...where'd I put my textbooks anyway?
@Morphin_K @secretrangerfan @trekkieb47 Sure Neanderthals started in Eurasia but by 100T ya, I'm pretty sure they were spread out. Eh, my--
@Morphin_K @secretrangerfan @trekkieb47 Frozen 100T years ago, he could be Neanderthal or homo sapiens and he doesn't look Neanderthal ;)
@Revieloutionne Isn't the answer to those questions always "Because toku"?
@TerrierLee_ I'm so uncoordinated, I could probably practice it for a month without getting it right :D
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @RyanCox20 ::squints at that article:: I...am going to be over here ignoring all of this nonsense.
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl Pardon me, I missed you playing along with me :D But yes, those two things are all that exists for me!
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Me, interestingly enough. You'd think I would name devices, but oddly I never have.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 @MorbySa @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @purplestripe66 Maybe? Keep me in the loop.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 @MorbySa @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel @purplestripe66 Ain't no party like a Ranger party, 'cause we got robots!
@lazycocos Everyone should be able to have that book in their own language. Because it encapsulates parenthood in a profound way.
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl If you haven't seen the ep...then don't. It's not worth it, even for Akira kissing a guy. Believe me.
@tptigger42 Yeah, I'm kinda over this discussion. ::hides under covers::
Schools are closed. I have a 10:50 doc appt. And there's an accident on the best road to get me there. Today's gonna be awesome.
@pockysquirrel So much love for that episode. The adorableness! Eiji's epiphany! Akashi is the best mommy! Sakura...heh.
@The2ndBatgirl Oh, you mean that episode they FORGOT TO MAKE? THE ONE THAT DOESN'T EXIST? Terrible that they skipped an episode, right?
@The2ndBatgirl Oooh, that's not good. I'm not sure you should attempt it without wine.
@The2ndBatgirl ::hides under bed to avoid the screams of agony:: Just remember, you can always join us in pretending it doesn't exist.
@trollprincess My Amazon wishlist is usually 1/2 SF/F and 1/2 history of medicine or history of science, so...yeah.
@pockysquirrel Momotaro! So much love :)
I mean, I posted one non-anon, so that's obvious. But I think the rest are pretty obviously me as well, even without my name.
I feel like I should start a challenge to see if people can guess which prompts on the sentai anon meme are mine. I bet you can :D
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne Heck yeah. I was trading pics of guys with someone on FB and I gave her Yoshi and the guy who plays Date.
@tptigger42 It's got all the hallmarks of great Super Sentai, so I'm happy :)
@tptigger42 I loved Ninninger! Dorky Dad! PITA Granddad! Sibling rivalry! Cousins who clearly grew up together! I'm in heaven :)
@Revieloutionne Shocked. Shocked, I say.
Of *course* it's going to snow when I've finally gotten around to making a psychiatrist appt. B/c driving in snow is great for my anxiety.
#powerrangers is my son asking to take karate so he can fight bad guys.
Relevant to many of my friends' interests: 
@pockysquirrel @TerrierLee_ Nope, it's because the little clasps aren't covered by a fabric panel unless I use the second row. Bad design!
@TerrierLee_ I want to know why the gorgeous bra with perfectly sized cups *has* to dig into my back. Why?
@TerrierLee_ Because creating decent bras is ROCKET SCIENCE. Or maybe brain surgery. I hate bra shopping.
@scalzi My hubby bought these. They were really good. "Were" being the operative term: My family wiped out the package in 2 days.
@arrowned I didn't mind snow when I was a kid (when dinosaurs roamed the earth) and it got me out of school. Now it means my kids stay home
@arrowned Yeees. I'm tired of staring out my window at white stuff. I hate snow.
QotD: The only time you should use an exclamation point is if you're saying "Help, I'm on fire!"

Sometimes I love my office :)
Nice thing of the day: Person says nasty things about PR on FB. I politely call him on it. He apologizes beautifully. All is forgiven!
@tptigger42 If I'm going to use fake curses, I've always preferred "frell" and "dren" anyway :) Farscape FTW!
Given how susceptible I am to prompts...if you want fic from me, go put a prompt here: 
@trekkieb47 @The2ndBatgirl Seriously, though, the mixture of drama and comedy is what makes the best PR/SS so good! (In my opinion :D)
@trekkieb47 @The2ndBatgirl But things are only good if they're grimdark and depressing! Humor has no place in good things. :P
@The2ndBatgirl Good luck! I hope it goes well!
@ultrasandriders @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel Kiva's song is...okay? I don't love it. I do love some earlier ones like Ryuki, Blade, Kuuga.
@The2ndBatgirl Rough life, yeah? (I mean, I *should* be doing laundry, but oh well.)
Bwahahaha! I totally forgot the bit where everyone agrees Hoji will cry at his sister's wedding and Doggie looks at Swan: "Cry" and she nods
I need to rewatch Dekaranger 43 (the meteorite about to hit the Earth) for fic purposes. My life is so hard ;)
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel That one's...still growing on me.
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel It's true. I always dislike them at first and then they grow on me. Except the Kuuga close, which I still hate
It took most of the day for the P/R "movie" to make it to my FB feed. People are slowing down in their old age, I guess ;)
@pockysquirrel I looked at Yael and said "OMG, he's more childish than we thought!"
@tptigger42 @TerrierLee_ Don't! It's going to be fine. I doubt very much Saban would go after fic! A "movie" is v. different to them.
@TerrierLee_ @tptigger42 Yes. I need fic. Without fic I will go stark raving bonkers and roam the streets with a stuffed penguin on my head.
@tptigger42 There I'm with you...if Saban decides to come down on fic, I'll be a giant squid of rage.
@tptigger42 ::nods:: I get that. I've decided to pretty much not bother with it :D
@tptigger42 I'm coming down on the side of transformative works. I'll never watch the thing, but I support his right to make (not sell) it.
@MrChangeDragon @RangerCrew No, they shouldn't. It's an interesting test case on transformative works but they'd be better off ignoring it.
Well, I *was* in a pretty good mood, but I just learned my beloved aunt (I've only got one) had a mild heart attack. She's okay, but...blurg
@tptigger42 Ugh ugh ugh. I hate that :(
@chrislhayes Thank you so much for asking Glenn Greenwald about his tux :D So awesome.
@Rivulet027 Errr, never? ::shudders::
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel Woot! I mean, oh shit, now I'm never going to get any work done ;)
@plutoHimself Eh, I think I've got enough to watch without adding this to my queue. I could watch Ninninger 1 again instead :)
@tsb_says I'm so glad everybody has said that it's grim and gritty so I don't waste my time watching it. Thank you!
@pockysquirrel ::grin:: I didn't make any predictions, so I'm safe. I thought someone had seen footage already, though? I don't remember.
It's cold out there. Really cold. Really goddamned cold. Wait...I don't have to leave the house until it's time to get the kids! Woot!
@pockysquirrel Not me, so much, although I have to admit the fact that whatsername is in it did seem more like pilot than fan film.
@plutoHimself Thank you for saving me the time I would have wasted actually watching it. I appreciate that.
@pockysquirrel But this confirms that it's a fan film, not some kind of failed pilot.
@Yoshistunts My son and I loved it. The zords are awesome and the family is so adorable and funny together. Yay ninjas!
But how much do I love the idea that the baddies are beaten by 40 people with strong feelings for Gentarou? A whole lot!
I mean Kengo, Yuki, Ryuusei, Tomoka, sure, but...JK? Gentarou? Shun? Miu? Love them but...no. Someone should be suspicious!
Watching Fourze movie. Love how even *Kengo* doesn't question that only a blithering idiot would let this bunch *near* a spaceship :D
@Rivulet027 This is one of the reasons EVERYONE is happier with me working at home. I suck at keeping my mouth shut.
@TerrierLee_ B and I thought it was a lot of fun! I look forward to hearing everyone else's opinion.
@pockysquirrel I like the black Dino Charge one, so I got it even without Pink. Because I just give up.
It's possible I bought B a Dino Charge t-shirt for his bday using the Pop Funk discount code. Also possible I bought one for me. Maybe.
Honestly, how bad can it be when my hubby is grilling chicken for dinner? ::looks at screaming children:: Er, don't answer that.
@pockysquirrel @tptigger42 And Barak and I loved it :)
Aaaaand, I broke down and B and I watched the HD version already :D We officially love the show already!
@RangerCommandPH I apologize if that was a rude comment. It's just...when people say "it's a kids' show," I wonder what they mean :D
Overtime's got the HD sub of Ninninnin...oh, however you spell it :D Do I download the HD or wait for SD? Hmm...
@RangerCommandPH And we can disagree and I'll still be a faithful listener because I enjoy your podcast :)
@tptigger42 I quite literally could not resist :)
@Rivulet027 In fact, as a general rule, people shouldn't talk down to other people. It's just rude! (I hate being talked down to A LOT.)
@RiderJetfire ::sigh:: In general, people are weird. Sometimes that's a good thing and sometimes it's not.
@RiderJetfire Straight acting? Er, ogling women? Asking women out over and over and over? No, wait, that's Jake-acting. I was confused.
@tsb_says @Revieloutionne Y'all will be the only people to witness a drunk Mara since 1992. Consider yourselves unfortunate.
@tsb_says @Revieloutionne As long as everyone is prepared for the fact I'll be drunk after 1/2 a bottle. 3/4 if I eat with it.
@tsb_says @Revieloutionne I second the "ignore Twitter" and I might have to request some Mike's Hard Lemonade (my only alcoholic drink).
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says Yeah, given my mental health issues, I can assure you that I don't do this looking for validation :(
@MorbySa Oh thank Darwin! I've encountered some unexpected raw milk advocates and I get nervous. Me? I like to avoid unnecessary germs...
@MorbySa ::wince:: Raw milk? Please tell me you were on the pro-pasteurization side? Pretty please?
@tsb_says ::whimpers quietly in the corner while sucking thumb::
@Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel Mia and...hmm. 11 would be adorable. Also someone like 4 or 5.
@Revieloutionne @MorbySa @TokuLadies_Pod ::facepalm:: Oh gods, you're right. I WAS JOKING. IT WAS A JOKE.
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 Moved and seconded! All in favor?
@MorbySa @TokuLadies_Pod Clearly TLP talk about this to piss people off and get more downloads of show talking about this stuff. Waitaminute
@pockysquirrel And now I remember why I hate everyone and everything and want to hide under my bed for the rest of my life.
@The2ndBatgirl I think I've also been unfollowed. ::sigh::
@tsb_says I'll need more Klonopin, so I'm going to go back to work now.
@The2ndBatgirl Will I get a notice when people unfollow me, like when they follow? I like to know who's mad at me so I can stress about it
@tsb_says TELL ME I'M NOT ALLOWED TO RESPOND TO THAT. Because WTF? Sorry, but your kid does. They may not do anything wrong, but they see it
@pockysquirrel Yes! I don't think it's racist now, but I think it's an interesting question to consider. And watch how it develops.
@MrChangeDragon @RangerCommandPH True. I'm vastly amused that everyone is offended by "Huh, this might be problematic, let's discuss it!"
@The2ndBatgirl I'm around most of the day to edit said blogpost :)
@RiderJetfire @tptigger42 It was totally the funniest joke in that show. I laughed SO HARD.
@tsb_says Yeah. I'll be over here with my bottle of Klonopin if you need me...
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel No point in engaging with the current discussion. Shamus and I have sufficiently pissed him off ;)
@pockysquirrel I haven't had enough Klonopin. I'll be over here having a minor panic attack and remembering why I shouldn't engage.
Most importantly, someone remind me that arguing on the Internet gives me panic attacks and I shouldn't do it. Where's my Klonopin? Ugh.
I have a terrible case of Someone Is Wrong on the Internet. Please stop me. It's just going to raise my blood pressure.
@chrisevans17 @rankal @RangerCommandPH ::shrug:: I'm glad to know I'm NOT  the only parent in the discussion. But whatev.
@chrisevans17 @rankal @RangerCommandPH Umm, they do look racist. If it's a one-time thing, then no prob. But too much like that builds up...
@chrisevans17 @rankal @RangerCommandPH I apologize for wanting my CHILDREN to watch the best possible shows. Am I the only parent here?
@pockysquirrel Veeeery carefully, of course :)
@chrisevans17 @rankal @RangerCommandPH We're saying "this is potentially problematic" not "OMG IT'S AWFUL!" We aren't the ones overreacting.
@PunkPinkPower Join the club. It's like..."Do they have ANY idea what it means to say he's been alive 100,000 years???"
@rankal @chrisevans17 @RangerCommandPH And it IS awesome! I'm loving DC so amazingly much. I'm just worried that small missteps may grow.
@rankal @chrisevans17 @RangerCommandPH Not a measuring stick, but my two kids are watching w/me. I want it to be as awesome as possible.
@pockysquirrel &lt;sing song&gt; Told ya so!&lt;/sing song&gt; I even had Sakura tell Masumi that in a fic once...because she's smart enough to notice.
@pockysquirrel After having kids, I realized 99% of fairy tales are goddamned creepy. Don't get me started on The Little Mermaid's moral.
@pockysquirrel I never noticed that!
For the record: Saying "X may be problematic if it's not dealt with" is not being overly mean and critical of a show.
@pockysquirrel Y'know, I was gonna go to bed, but maybe I'll stay up and watch your all-caps reactions to this episode. They'll soothe me :)
@pockysquirrel ::considers:: Er...yes? I cried less at the end of that ep than I did at the end of Flowers for Algernon, though.
In non-toku news, I'm making a new pair of fingerless mittens. At least a pair if I have enough yarn. Whoops? I may visit AC Moore tomorrow.
@rankal @chrisevans17 @RangerCommandPH If you mean they're not critiques of modern society, okay. But that doesn't give 'em a free pass.
@chrisevans17 @rankal @RangerCommandPH ::sigh:: Not a double standard. It's about *power* and sexualization. The @TokuLadies_Pod can explain
@rankal @RangerCommandPH @chrisevans17 Wait...kids shows aren't reflections of modern society? Are they somehow outside our universe? ;)
@Revieloutionne ::sigh:: That's what I was afraid of. Well, I'm not zooming through this series, so I have some time...
Like...it's not "holy shit, what were they smoking?" sexist like Kiva. It's just got so much "women want men!" and "how can a girl fight?"
I've watched a few eps of Gaoranger and I'm sure it *could* be more irritatingly and yet politely sexist, but I'm not sure how.
@tptigger42 And if the prof wanted them to write a paper about the fics, then fine, but it's like the prof's never read a comments section.
@tptigger42 ::looks at list:: Wow. This is a TERRIBLE selection of fic to throw at newbies. o_O What are they teaching?
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel There ya go, that's clearly evidence :)
Fascinating that I'm really enjoying Fourze but have zero desire to fic. SMH. I'll never understand my brain. Prompts, anyone?
@pockysquirrel @Marvey_Chan You *so* need it in your life :)
@TerrierLee_ I like the Regency ones with fancy balls and ladies carrying fans. Also romance/mystery combos (like Nora Roberts).
@TerrierLee_ Not that there's anything wrong with the "girl" comics, of course :D Just not my thing. But I love me some historical romances.
@TerrierLee_ My comics are stereotypically boy and my books are all over. Fantasy, romance, military SF, mysteries, science, archaeology...
@TerrierLee_ Obviously Torin is secretly a girl. Or something.
@TerrierLee_ I don't know why I'm even surprised that's an explanation. Because we all know men only do MANLY MANLY things, right?
@TerrierLee_ JFC, entire sentai teams go in disguise as women. That doesn't make them female!
@TerrierLee_ I def didn't see it as pigtails. And now I'm going to have to check the subs because I *swear* OT used "he" and him.
@pockysquirrel Headcanon accepted. This fixes the "no speaka the English" problem, so yay.
@TerrierLee_ I thought Luckiero was referred to as "he" in the OT subs? I'd pretty much assumed he was a he, at least.
Went to children's theater with B this PM. Distractingly, Dog was played by apparent love child of Brennan &amp; Yoshi. Led to impure thoughts.
I'm pretty sure Koda's actually his favorite and he only said Shelby because he heard me say she's mine :D
Just watched "A Fool's Hour" with Barak. As expected, he loved it. He says Koda is the funniest, but Shelby is his favorite.
@pockysquirrel Well, yeah. I'm pretty sure that's the reason for all intra-team Boukenger fights, in fact.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne @PunkPinkPower I can't wait for ninjas! ::bounces:: I'm super excited :)
::sigh:: Time to go shovel the snow and ice :( We haven't been plowed yet, so no hubby here to help me. Ugh. I hate snow SO MUCH.
@pockysquirrel They really are something special, aren't they? They're like the ancestor of Chase's pants :)
@tptigger42 @pockysquirrel Electric stoves...ugh. When we were house-hunting, gas stove was just below AC and separate dining room.
@pockysquirrel Oh man, I love that episode. "Here, I'll give this powerful weapon to the demon! Because I trust him and I'm a Red!"
@pockysquirrel Do you KNOW what happened when Akashi let them sleep in a different tent? THE TROUBLE THEY GOT IN? They can't be trusted!
@MorbySa @pockysquirrel Why do I still love him? Prob the pants. I get so distracted by the pants I don't notice the womanizing.
@RiderJetfire On the bright side, I'm a sucker for lost and found parents and touching reunions, so I bet we'll have that!
@RiderJetfire I bet a centuries-old white guy will speak perfect American English, while after 100,000 years Koda talks caveman. IJS.
@RiderJetfire ::nods:: I can see that. I think that would a great storyline.
@RiderJetfire Even leaving out the VRT connection, that would be cool! But then would Gold be his dad? Not sure they'll do that.
@justshai It should have enough bulk to keep the meds from irritating your stomach, so yeah, I'd go for it.
@pockysquirrel Oh, 13? ::wince:: Er, yeah, that's not a stellar moment for him. Best I can say is it's not *quite* as bad as you think?
@pockysquirrel HOORAY! There's more good stuff to come :)
@pockysquirrel Yeah, he's... problematic. Sometimes he's written made of pure awesome and sometimes I want to THROTTLE him.
@pockysquirrel I tell you...the man finds people he loves and puts them on the team so he can protect them. He's an adorable idiot.
@tptigger42 Lookit that! I can't even type 100,000 correctly today! Good grief. I probably should just go back to bed and stop typing.
-painful for me to witness. Can't count the times I've had to say "Uh no, that's not him being in love, that's him being icky and scary"...
-that adults do, but they're taking in the racism/sexism/classism they see/read. The things my kids identify as "he's in love with her" are-
I think people without experience with kids often underestimate how much kids take in from media they see. They may not get all the nuances-
Er, "Avi went" not "Avi's went". I seem to be having difficulty with my English. Maybe I'm a caveman who's lived 100,00 years? ::eyeroll:
Oh goody. It's snowing A LOT and Avi's went to shul with the kids and no cell phone. Will he come home? Go to his parents? Who knows?
@RangerCommandPH You'd be surprised how much kids understand. But I'm LOVING DC and I hope that these things *will* be explained well.
@RangerCommandPH For the record, my 5-year-old told me that Jake chased after Gia and then she decided she liked him. No prompting from Mom.
@RangerCommandPH We'll have to agree to disagree on the Shelby &amp; Kendall interaction in ep. 2. But I hope you're right Shelby's our POV char
@RangerCommandPH @PowerRangers @BrennanMejia @Yoshistunts @MimiHyde @PutItOnMyTabe @James_JDavies LOVED IT! So much fun :)
@The2ndBatgirl @pockysquirrel I am NOT writing that fic. Nope. Definitely not. Someone else had better write it, though.
Barak is going to LOVE that final scene. That's perfect five-year-old humor :) #powerrangers #DinoCharge
@mamafriesmeal @The2ndBatgirl Yes :) I love "Rexy" ::giggles madly:: It's exactly how my kids name their toys!
,&lt;chants&gt;Shel-by! Shel-by! Shel-by!

#PowerRangers #DinoCharge
"It's about to get wild!" YAY! #dinocharge
Yay for Chase not being an asshole when he realizes he's wrong! #DinoCharge
Man, I'm not used to having to wait through commercials! When did I last watch something live? Long ago. #DinoCharge
@The2ndBatgirl HA! That would be way more awesome.
@pockysquirrel Ah well, it's in the grand tradition of "secret identities" while transforming in the middle of town, right?
Yay, Tyler! Love him already. Not loving the ridiculousness of Koda having been alive/awake 100,000 years. #dinocharge
@The2ndBatgirl ::happy sigh:: I love those Reds SO MUCH. Can't wait :) #DinoCharge
@pockysquirrel Yeah, it bugged me too. I don't know exactly why. Something about Shelby's reaction? Or the implication that young is better?
Shirtless Yoshi is a happy thing. They love us so much. Love Kendall and Shelby's shared amusement over Chase. #DinoCharge
I love the setup of Sledge using the monsters he caught to try and retrieve the Energems. Clever. #dinocharge
Ready for #dinocharge! Hooray for the mute button to avoid commercials!
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 Yeah. I log in to my Verizon acct and when I try to access the eps it says I need "something or other Plus". Ugh.
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 It claims we don't have the "right" FiOS with extra special givethemmoremoney. Or whatever.
@Rivulet027 @pockysquirrel I DVR the eps and after that I'll wait for them to show up on Amazon Prime. Nyah.
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 Yep, it won't let me in. I have Verizon FiOS and get Nick on the TV but it's apparently insufficient. Stupid.
@RangerCommandPH I just laughed SO HARD at "Eric, your courage to stand up for a show that sucked for four years..." ::dies::
The kids are at shul with Daddy, so I get to, er, have to watch the new Dino Charge ep all by myself :D I'll watch with the kids later.
@secretrangerfan I can think of several other women who'll do the same, so you might be safe. I'd either walk out or scream. Maybe cry?
@Yoshistunts Not gonna lie...I totally cried at the end with Grita and their families and WAH!
@MorbySa ::nods:: Yeah. But Voice's "good luck" to Sakura was hilarious.
@MorbySa I was a bit disappointed too. I felt somewhat better after watching the xover with Gekiranger movie.
@tsb_says I remember a friend's phone weather app saying there was a light drizzle while we were hiding under an awning b/c of downpour.
::facepalm:: Oh yeah, we were supposed to help Barak do a book report in Hebrew school. Right. How late are we, exactly? UGH. HATE.
@The2ndBatgirl And Yael wants to watch after I was telling her how awesome Shelby is! And that a Purple Ranger was coming! Hooray!
@MorbySa Yay! I'm glad you're enjoying it, because I love that bunch of dorks SO MUCH. Dorky dork dorks. ::bounces::
@MorbySa I love that! I know that we can't exactly learn everything about a society from its kids shows, but I love what we do get.
@MorbySa MOMOTARO!!! I love that one, esp b/c I saw a stage version of that fairy tale with Yael a few years ago.
@Revieloutionne @MorbySa I didn't know that! Awesome :)
There's really no reason why the kids having a 2-hour delay should throw my schedule *so* off, but it does. I need to get moving!
@pockysquirrel SUCH a Red. I want to pinch his cheeks, feed him cookies, and point out he's an idiot. I liked that two-parter a lot.
@RiderJetfire Note to self: Watch Flash instead of Arrow. I'm all about talking gorillas instead of manpain.
With @MorbySa and @pockysquirrel watching Boukenger for the first time, I'm getting the urge to do rewatch :) Maybe this weekend?
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Souta's pants are pretty astounding. ::happy sigh:: I love Souta and his pants :)
@Revieloutionne @tsb_says Alas, you are correct. ::facepalm::
@tsb_says though Nightwing is canonically Roma rather than white! Ugh, I hate America sometimes.
@tsb_says The pathetic thing is that you know Hollywood would never pick either of them because they're not all-American white enough, even-
@tsb_says I just did a little jump and squee when I saw his response
@MorbySa I love Sakura so much :) It was surprisingly subversive for sentai, I thought.
@MrChangeDragon @TerrierLee_ ::executes spit-take all over keyboard:: As with Magiranger, I will not ship siblings. Cousins...maybe?
@justshai That's a difficult decision. I know I struggled with it for a long time :(
@justshai I don't remember how much we paid, but it was probably in that realm somewhere. Ugh.
@The2ndBatgirl @BrennanMejia @Yoshistunts You know I'd sign that petition any day of the week! And twice on Sundays, even.
Someone in a FB group just asked where to find health insurance that doesn't cover birth control. Trolling or super trolling? ::snort::
@Revieloutionne Exactly. He's hot and if there were other people to take the brunt of his being a jerk, I could see it.
@Revieloutionne Yeah, I think any of us would turn into assholes if we'd had to deal with him for long enough.
@tsb_says ::eyeroll:: I hope they give us his reason ass soon. I didn't hate Date Akira this much and he was mean to my beloved Gotou!
Yuuto, we know pretty quickly he's the past Yuuto, so sadness. Nitoh's always adorable. Everyone in Kiva's an ass, so...
I think the reason I hate Gou more than the typical 2nd Rider is that (unlike others) we don't know why he's an ass. Usually we get a reason
Terui's family, Hajime's an Undead, Ryusei's buddy, everyone's reasons in Ryuki. I guess it took some time with Date too?
@Rivulet027 @tptigger42 Children sense when you're trying to concentrate. I have worked while a child was *literally* bouncing on my head.
@tptigger42 @Rivulet027 Yep, that's pretty much why the bunnies bite while my kids are shrieking and being a pain...
@pockysquirrel Well, you may not end up loving it as much as we do. ::shrug:: To each their own and all that :)
@pockysquirrel I ship all of them. Not quite an OT6 like Gokaiger, but...Red/everyone, Black/Blue, Pink/Yellow, Blue/Pink...etc.
@pockysquirrel ::sporfle:: What's TSB's line? Toku means never having to say you're kidding? Yeah, that.
Today in Out-of-Context Theater:

Barak: Tigers can NOT play chess!
@BurgundyRanger I did my part. I was talking the show up in my son's kindergarten class at the Valentine's party, I swear!
What percentage of KR Kink Meme fills are by me at this point? Pls someone else fill one! I want to read fic I didn't write :D
@pockysquirrel It has lots of adorable characters and is often funny. There's a great female villain and a female wizard (for a short time).
@pockysquirrel I adore Wizard. It's not perfect by any means but there's a lot to love. For the record, Yael and I ship Haruto/donuts.
Out of context theater...
@RiderJetfire @The2ndBatgirl Ha, I knew that saying that would lure you here! You've fallen into my trap ;)
@tsb_says Right, you've never been in my house. You have no idea how much stuff we have :D
@trollprincess There's a *reason* I don't use a laptop bag. If I'm going to look unprofessional, it should be on my terms. ::snort::
@tsb_says You're ridiculous. That's what they get paid to do. You'll have plenty of moving and carrying to do soon!
@The2ndBatgirl Wow, it's a good thing you have them around to keep you up-to-date, right?
@The2ndBatgirl Did you know that in Japan, the yellow Ranger was A BOY??? (Sorry, had to be done :D)
@wamu885news As a rule, any question that includes the words "be allowed to carry a loaded shotgun" should probably have the answer "No."
@TerrierLee_ Has someone written Right traumatized the first he's served chicken afterward? But then eating it anyway?
@DigiRanger1994 @BurgundyRanger So they mean an hour of fools? I could see that. We'll find out eventually :)
@tptigger42 Oh no, I meant like messing with us because it's fun and it amuses everyone. I don't see any intent to deceive.
@tptigger42 I'm pretty sure he knows and is baiting us :D
@BurgundyRanger Either a craft store (Michael's, AC Moore) or someplace like the Container Store will have something appropriate.
@Revieloutionne Well, that right there is a sign to run in the other direction while shrieking at the top of our lungs.
@kitaokaapologst @Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel @tsb_says Oh good point. I think I can stop worrying, then.
@Revieloutionne Do I want to know? (I accept that the answer might be HELL NO.)
@lazycocos ::grin:: I'm glad. Those two crack me up. I don't necessarily ship them, per se, but...hilarious.
@pockysquirrel @tsb_says Yeah, that's what makes me nervous. But if he's not a moron, he's got to at least get some of the connotations!
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel In all seriousness, I agree he's doing it on purpose. Presumably Brennan is in on the joke? I hope?
@tsb_says Y'know, I'm beginning to agree with D that he might be a result of your id at work...but that's a good thing ;)
@secretrangerfan Me too! I love how different characters interact and little in-jokes about the separate series and just...love :)
@secretrangerfan I really hope they do it, but I agree they probably won't. I love that movie and I love good xovers!
@tsb_says Exactly. Remember that for one trip you can always cram things on the floor and in the trunk and in the passenger seat...
@tsb_says We hired movers once. Long stupid story. Ugh. We kept out blankets/pillows/shampoo/etc. and put them in our car for the move.
@tsb_says Go you!
@tsb_says The last bit of packing is the worst b/c it's an example of Zeno's Paradox. You'll always be halfway through whatever's left.
Aaaaany moment now I'm gonna get my ass off the couch and shovel the sidewalk/clean off the cars. Really. Honest. I swear.
@BurgundyRanger There should definitely be an apostrophe involved. It could be "A Fools' Hour" if there were multiple fools, I suppose.
@TerrierLee_ Nothing wrong with crying. I know I did.
@BrennanMejia My son and I are loving it, especially the humor! He says that Tyler is cool but that he should be careful around the volcano.
@Revieloutionne ::snerk:: You can see why I might have sporfled, though :D
@Revieloutionne My first thought was "I'm pretty sure I'd remember THAT episode". However, you are correct that the boxers made zero sense.
@Revieloutionne Please tell me you broke the tweet at that point on purpose. Because if I'd been drinking, you'd owe me a new laptop.
@pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl @tptigger42 That would be nice! Maybe Yael will watch DC with B &amp; me? She wants to try Nininger, so...maybe?
@TerrierLee_ Does this mean you're going to watch the crack-addled, er, I mean the great Kyoryuger Hero Next movie instead? :D
We can hurt the tobacco companies! We can lower worldwide smoking rates! Down with Big Tobacco! #JeffWeCan
@The2ndBatgirl @tptigger42 I agree. I generally have a zero Barbies in the house policy, but for a Shelby, I might rethink it.
@MorbySa I took some time to warm up to him, for some reason. I dunno. But eventually I adored him :)
@lazycocos f/f is misogynist? I...that...huh? Oh, fandom, never change, you're so...adorable. ::coughs::
@Revieloutionne Oh well, of *course*. And I can spell Chhannukkahhh in Hebrew too, but that doesn't help me in English :D
A big thank you to @overtimesubs for getting us the final ToQger ep early this week. I really really really appreciated it!
@pockysquirrel It's set up for him to learn that lesson. As long as they follow through. Yael still wants Kiriko to punch him &amp; I agree.
Also, kids and I are super excited about Ninninger. Nininger? Nnininininger? Bloody hell, it's almost as bad as Hanukkah.
We watched Drive. Maybe Gou is going to finally learn a lesson about hubris? Yael and I live in hope.
@Revieloutionne Arms. Those arms. Bless whoever thought it was a good idea to have him sleeveless so often.
@pockysquirrel @overtimesubs Besides, sleep is highly overrated, especially as compared to adorable children on trains.
@pockysquirrel @overtimesubs That's almost exactly what happened to me, except my exact reaction was "Oh fuck."
@pockysquirrel It's entirely possible I've got the tissue box on my lap. Just possible. ::sniffles:: Gonna miss this show. ::more sniffles::
@pockysquirrel @TokuLadies_Pod ::bows:: Your wish is my command :D (Or: I'm a sucker for a good fic prompt.)
@TokuLadies_Pod Tyler and Eiji meet in front of a museum: 
@pockysquirrel I'm a sucker for the Goseiger opening and closing songs. I also love the opening songs for Kuuga, Blade, and Ryuki.
@TerrierLee_ I'm reminded of my wedding night, where I walked around the hotel lobby saying "I love you. Now go away." to family members.
@pockysquirrel Sounds totally rational to me :) Personally, I'm thinking about watching it again without a small shrieking boy next to me.
@TerrierLee_ I get my husband. Then my father calls. Then my MIL calls. Then Barak wakes up. Then my husband again. Etc and so on.
@TerrierLee_ Welcome to my world of having two children. Even after they're supposed to be asleep, I'm interrupted.
Work and/or writing the Eiji&amp;Tyler fic would go better if I'd gotten &gt;5 hours of sleep last night. Hubby: Hurry home from NY!
@RiderJetfire Souta's pants are a thing of beauty and a joy forever. Also, Sakura kicks ass and I have a thing for Masumi. I LOVE BOUKENGER.
@RiderJetfire You can't go wrong with Boukenger. Besides the reddest Red to ever Red in Reddom, there's also Souta's pants. ::happy sigh::
Just had to cancel Yael's birthday party due to icy roads. I hope I made the right decision. Don't wanna do this again in 2 weeks :(
@arrowned @The2ndBatgirl I don't know why I'm surprised people would say that. ::sigh:: She was so not overreacting. Good grief.
@TerrierLee_ Basically, if Disney is involved, assume the worst. The assholes.
@TerrierLee_ Probably covered under transformative works, although Disney is known for not giving a flying rat's patootie about the law.
@arrowned Hmm, yeah, sorry? Not sorry?
@arrowned It's glorious crack. It's made of psychedelic drugs and love and puppies. Oh, and cameos.
@BurgundyRanger That was just weird. I mean, my son can't read the MUSEUM sign, but Tyler can, one assumes :D
@BurgundyRanger My son's too young to read :D But was it Tyler who asked if it was the museum? Wasn't he there in the last episode?
::coughs:: So, @TokuLadies_Pod, if I happen to have written a 1,300-word rant about Kiva, who do I send it to?
@Revieloutionne ::googles shota:: Ah. Ah yes. Yes, I can see why you wouldn't reblog.
@Revieloutionne @Rivulet027 Yes, the sad thing is that my mind was like "was it race? was it gender? was it apparent religion?" :(
ARGL. DVR ate the last few mins of ep. Can someone tell me what happened after Chase asked Keeper what's wrong? Barak and I want to know!
@Revieloutionne Yeah, I guess that statement is rather hypocritical given my own apparent inability to heed warnings, huh? :D
1,300 words on what bugged me about Kiva. I think I'm done now? I'm feeling better now, I think. Too bad nobody will heed my warning ;)
@Revieloutionne Whew. I'm glad my Nitoh worked! I wanted to make him gay for this fic but it just didn't happen. Characters are stubborn.
@Revieloutionne I know. It was supposed to be a PWP? Stupid Haruto with his stupid feelings and stupid Nitoh with his stupid heterosexuality
@seananmcguire OMG. That's awful :(
@seananmcguire YES. I don't know how the complainers think people are supposed to live without toilet paper/toothpaste. Let them try it.
Posted PWP and wrote 865 words on why I disliked Kiva. Now I need to get dressed and start cleaning for Yael's b-day party.
And now I should be either sleeping or cleaning for Yael's b-day party, which explains why I'm finishing a Haruto/Nitoh PWP. ::facepalm::
@justshai Oh! How could I forget Dekaranger, where the boys specifically comment on how Pink and Yellow act like girlfriends? :)
@justshai Alas, not in this movie or the series these actors came from. You want, e.g., Gokaiger, Goseiger, Shinkenger for that :)
@TerrierLee_ Fair enough :) I'm a contrary type and I get that reaction too. For whatever reason, Green/Black worked for me. YMMV.
@tsb_says Yes we need to or yes I need to shut up now already? ;)
@TerrierLee_ Nothing wrong with not liking certain pairings, even popular ones. I'm sometimes stubborn like that too :)
@TerrierLee_ I agree. He's really adorable and funny too. Ucchi's actor got to have SO MUCH FUN, though, which is great.
@TerrierLee_ Well, there isn't *that* much. I'm just kind of...focused :D Nobu's actor didn't get enough focus, though.
@TerrierLee_ I mean, it's total crack, I'm not gonna lie. But worth watching nonetheless.
Did I mention that we need to watch the crack-addled Kyoryuger actor movie at Couchcon? ::stares at photos:: 
@TerrierLee_ I almost never buy toys but I might just have to buy a Shelby. Because Shelby.
@tsb_says Yeeeeeees. I approve heartily as well.
@pockysquirrel @The2ndBatgirl THE CHICKEN WIGS DESERVE ALL-CAPS. ALWAYS. BECAUSE CHICKEN WIGS.
@SherwoodRN @chrislhayes @DrBobSears But reactions are rare! The diseases are much more dangerous and the longer you wait, the riskier it is
@pockysquirrel "No fear, no pain! Chou henshin, Kamen Rider Kuuga!"

::coughs:: I have no idea what you're talking about.
@pockysquirrel Is there a word for that? Because I'm sure Yael and I sound HILARIOUS trying to "sing" along to the Drive theme.
Poss titles for Kiva essay: The bad, the worse, and the sexist; The show that proves the Toku Ladies right; Oh gods, why did I watch this?
@chrislhayes Thank you thank you for pushing back on that point!
@pockysquirrel I've been getting my notifications delayed, out of order, or not at all for weeks. ::throws hands in the air::
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne I seriously can't wait. I really hope you love it as much as I do :) Maybe I'll do some rewatching.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne Kiva is basically a perfect representation of everything that created TLP, so...yeah.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne As long as you're prepared, is all I'm saying :) But I think you'd have more fun watching W or Kuuga.
@nekollx @pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne Other than Nagano the abusive boyfriend, Jirou the abusive boyfriend, Otoya the cheater etc....sure.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne Don't blame us when you end up making an entire TLP that is just you ranting about how terrible Kiva is. IJS.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel That's an accurate description, I think. Do not be dumb like me and watch it.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne NO NO NO OH GODS NO. This show will make you cry in a bad way and there's not enough of the belt to save it.
@Revieloutionne @pockysquirrel Oh heck yes, he really did. I love the bat in the bathtub! Well, and Wataru in the bathtub...
I don't wanna work. I just wanna look at screenshots of two guys kissing from the Hero Next film. Canonical slash! Pretty boys!
@arrowned @pockysquirrel Yeah, as soon as I wrote that tweet, I started to second-guess myself. I might get flashbacks ;)
@pockysquirrel Yep. I might feel the need to rant about the love triangles and how horribly every single woman is treated.
@pockysquirrel YES. Longer form discussion of these series would be awesome. Wait, can I offer to write one about Kiva's gender problems?
@lazycocos I've never understood the need to have everyone love exactly the same things in exactly the same way. I'm all about YMMV.
@Popehat Nobody's asking them that because the Democratic party hasn't turned into an anti-medicine party promoting pseudoscience.
@lazycocos them just because I do :) Maybe I'll write PTSD fic for them someday. Maybe I won't. Depends on if I find a story worth telling.
@lazycocos Huh. I like all three of those characters but not because they have mental health issues. I don't think anyone else has to like--
@TerrierLee_ I know. They're just so adorable and precious and I'm NOT READY FOR THE END.
Brennan posted a shirtless with a backpack pic and all I can do now is stare at his arms and drool. Boy's got serious arm muscles. Whoa.
@tsb_says Oh gods, don't give me MORE plot bunnies. This one's even in my bailiwick, since I've attended and worked archaeology conferences!
@pockysquirrel Damn, I hadn't thought of that. But on the bright side, at least Koda appears to be as allergic to sleeves as Yoshi.
@tsb_says @Revieloutionne I don't remember it setting me off and I have similar issues, so it should be okay.
@tsb_says Yes. My therapist used to always point out that it's not crazy to be upset when upsetting things are happening.
I have a ton of work, a million WsIP, a messy house, and in-laws coming for dinner. Why am I writing fic about Hyde feeling lonely?
LRT: It's comforting to know that even one of the great scientific minds felt that way sometimes, isn't it?
@LindsJHoffman o_O No. No, it doesn't.
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl Maybe he's really a she? Or possibly a transgender monster and I shouldn't notice it?
@Revieloutionne I love Goseiger, so that's a recommendation for Gingaman :)
@The2ndBatgirl OMG, that would be so awesome. Nozomu for the practical stuff and RJ for the theory. Together they fight crime! And monsters!
Watching a Goseiger ep while eating lunch. Reminded that Nozomu is the best mentor ever ;)
@tsb_says @pockysquirrel @MorbySa Wah :(
@pockysquirrel I need to make sure our DVR is set. Fortunately, Barak is too young to realize when the show is actually *on*.
@pockysquirrel My husband has carefully arranged to leave for New York so that we need to be dropping him off at the bus when DC is on. Grr.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne Good for you. If it gets us more "doing handstands on each other" pictures, I'm all for it.
@pockysquirrel @Revieloutionne I'm betting she's referring to you encouraging Brennan and Yoshi. But I'm all for encouraging them :D
I should be sleeping. Why am I dling Timeranger and pondering my "Gou has amnesia" story instead? Ugh. Must go sleep now.


@pockysquirrel I'm sorry, the brain you are trying to reach has melted. Please try again later.
Yael and I did much plotting of the amnesia fic in the car, but we have questions that either don't have answers or we don't remember.
For fic purposes: Was Kiriko just surprised Gou *was* a KR or that he *knew* about KRs? Did she know he was w/Prof Harley? Did Belt know?
@Revieloutionne ::giggles madly:: Blame me! Everyone's doing it! It's America's favorite pastime ;) But really...how could you explain?
@Revieloutionne Never. Nobody can be prepared for it.
Is it possible to listen to "Te Wo Tsunagou" too many times in a day? I'm asking for a friend. ::coughs::
@Revieloutionne It felt like a reset button to me and I'm not a fan of those. ::shrug::
@Revieloutionne I can see that interpretation, but the last bits looked like "everyone is back to the beginning" to me.
@Revieloutionne Er, Ren is a *loner* jerk is what I meant to say ;) Whether he's longer or not is difficult to say, even given toku costumes
@Revieloutionne okay, Shinji was still an idiot, Ren is back to being a longer jerk...although at least Tezuka's alive, I guess.
@Revieloutionne But now everything the characters have learned over the season is wiped out! Kitaoka's scum again, Asakura's free, Shinji...
@Revieloutionne But are there any that don't suck? Because I've decided to headcanon endings to both series and be done with it.
I'm impressed that Ryuki has four alternate endings and they all suck. That's gotta be a record. Blade only has two crappy possible endings.
@The2ndBatgirl Well then, they won't be getting any of *my* money. ::eyeroll: Nothing much I want there.
@trollprincess ::pats IMDB:: Oh, that's so adorable :)
Many problematic things in this Hero Next film. And I'm choosing to ignore every single one of them. Because I need the laughs.
@tsb_says Yes, they should not take that as a suggestion. Ugh.
@tsb_says Despite my dental phobia, that ep didn't bother me. If there'd been a "humorous" dentist shot w/giant needle I'd have freaked.
@pockysquirrel @Rivulet027 Well, I don't drink, so while y'all drink, I'll write ;)
@Revieloutionne I had a rotary phone growing up. In fact, I had quite a few conversations with the guy I married on that phone :D
@Rivulet027  I figure that's probably the other thing to accomplish at Couchcon. We'll make each other finish fic!
@Rivulet027 Well, OF COURSE :D Do you have any idea how much fic I've written just since TSB got me to watch Gokaiger???
@Rivulet027 Oh we'll give you plenty of new shows to be in love with :D ::cackles evilly:: So much fun to be had!
THE CAMEOS. Shinken Gold. Gokai Blue. Go-on Black and Silver. Deka Green. I'm thirsty, but I can't drink for fear of spit-takes.
Holy shit, we are SO watching this at Couchcon, if only to play "Isn't that...?" every five minutes.
@Revieloutionne @The2ndBatgirl That's a trend that we all devoutly wish will continue.
@The2ndBatgirl I'm pretty sure Yael and I did at least once. I forget when, though.
@tsb_says You don't need to have seen it to see the Hero Next movie. That one is unrelated to the show. (Although OOO is fun!)
@tsb_says It could be fun to watch the OOO one and try and figure out what they meant to say :D Also Watanabe Shu is hot.
@tsb_says The others are not parodies. I watched a few minutes of the OOO one and it looks good. The sub is barely English, though.
@tsb_says I haven't found a sub of the Gokaiger one yet. There's also KR:OOO (I've got a horrid sub),  Fourze, and this Kyoryuger one.
@tsb_says It's a Kyoryuger parody where the actors are playing the exact opposite roles. Also Green and Black just kissed. So yeah.
