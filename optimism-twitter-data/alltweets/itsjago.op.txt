@ZoomJer @apocalypsekow Your love?
If @apocalypsekow wrote a Fringe show with what we were comfortable with, it would be an hour of game show and infomercial parodies.
@tanis_eh So it's a tent?
@Kevin_Church But I've got Very Important Things to Say!
@VariantEDmonton I am one of those people who is so focused on the task at hand, and then another task occurs to me and goodbye first task.
@VariantEDmonton So 70s Cyclops?
@VariantEDmonton I'm not the only one who has an eight-track mind?
What did I have yesterday that's playing havoc with my colon? The mediocre brunch buffet? The gummi coke bottles? Six cake donuts?
@AdamTwoNames and those itty bitty calves! Wuzza buzza baby calves!
@AdamTwoNames I won't discount her due to her lower center of gravity.
@davidlsims Not available in my area. Should I be grateful?
@Leask Time for me to start having kids!
@AdamTwoNames Can I borrow your kid for planking workouts?
Stupid bird hits our window ten times in a row. Stupid bird! #stupidbird
@worstninjaever @leah_literally Bravo.
@leah_literally @worstninjaever "The puppies taste like puppies!"
@DavidUzumeri The anti-cab equation?
@leah_literally @worstninjaever A puppy-sized puppy. And a candy-shaped puppy.
@leah_literally @worstninjaever It's a puppy!
@beatonna Together they fight crime!
@TheMattDWilson I updated my passport  last month for trips down south, so now I'm one of the cool UV kids. 
Getting back on the Breaking Bad train! Hello, season five, what sadness will you produce.
@TheMattDWilson Members of the Illuminati now?
@Leask "Stop trying to make Alberta into a reserve?" "STOP TRYING TO MAKE ALBERTA INTO A RESERVE???"
@laura_hudson I laughed so hard at the video.
@Xeryfyn Dammit, Chris, I can't be crying before I drive to work like this!
@worstninjaever @lauraniwa Are the cats considered Niwas for ranking purposes?
@cameronMstewart @zdarsky Zdarsky is Murray?!? MURRAY IS ZDARSKY?!?
@GOODNESSaidan Your secret identity is a libertarian?
Dreamed that @ChelseaVPeretti and I were maliciously pranking each other backstage at a 60s-themed musical. It was Prestige-level shit.
@VariantEDmonton That crossover with The Flash was INSANE!
@jeffparker Yeah, there's a $2 price for an international shipper. And then it's $17 for shipping.
@jeffparker DOESN'T SHIP TO CANADA??? This is a rollercoaster, Parker!
@jeffparker Oh, crap, it IS the trade. I thought it was just one issue. That's a helluva deal.
@jeffparker 
@soupytoasterson @RNSrobot You know, Ryan, none of those words make sense.
@jeffparker Found it through one of your other replies. And now I see I can buy it for a poenny on Amazon. And then four bucks for shipping.
@jeffparker Dammit, Jeff, I just googled "Jeff Parker squirrel sex!" DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF WATCHLISTS I'M NOW ON???
@nickkroll Are you that yellow bird? The big one?
@RNSrobot @worstninjaever @scottybomb What were you thinking? I'm always doing something on Whyte at 9. Even if it's napping on the couch.

It's snowing in May, the NDP won an election, and McDonalds has replaced the Hamburglar??? #whatisgoingon?
For the first time in my Alberta voting history, I'm optimistic and hopeful about the government I helped choose. #abvote
The last time I've seen a province get rid of a PC government for the NDP with this kind of ferocity, I was living in Saskatchewan.
Watch this speech by Brian Jean where he also announces he's gone from politics. #abvote
@Leask Yuuuuuup.
@SUNBreakenridge Well, all up to the "Screw this, I'm out." ending.
Costliest mic drop ever? #abvote
Wow. Apparently I voted for a premier. Great campaign, @RachelNotley! Looking forward to the next few years.
@davecournoyer Hooooooly shit. Granted, I'll keep an open mind for the next few hours.
Too Full For Beans: The Kyle Jago Story. #CincoDeMayo
@ryzshrn I've been ready since Klein.
@ryzshrn The optimist in me hopes so, but the realist hates half the population after an election.
Celebrating #CincoDeMayo with my first-ever tequila drink! @Rostizado_yeg 
I did my civic duty to satisfy the legislative booty.
@Doctor_Teeth Were the length of the tantrums negotiated?
@Doctor_Teeth At least your brother will understand when you yell at him the entire time.
@unfoRETTAble They had the actor who plays Mark and the clones on an interview show last week. He looks so normal.
@MichaelSweetser I'll always be sad it's not Edgar Wright's version, though.
@MichaelSweetser There were some problems I had with the movie, but I'd much rather watch this than Sad Supes.
@MichaelSweetser The thing I LOVED about it was that The Avengers were a unit focused on saving people.
@laura_hudson Does that giraffe have its tongue stuck to the pole?
@Doctor_Teeth Even in my dreams, my arrogance and incompetence comes out.
@Doctor_Teeth And yet I was adamant of doing the part because it was funny.
@Doctor_Teeth I don't remember any of it now, and my performance was constantly shouting "Line!" over and over.
Dreamed that @Doctor_Teeth and I wrote a sketch about a bigoted spaceman that was being performed on CBC. I had way too many lines.
@worstninjaever @RoundTableLaw "Don't forget, Jago's the blue one." "No, I'm the pink one. THE PINK ONE!!"
@RoundTableLaw It took me a few rounds to figure it out. I though the goal was to eat the most pellets, not kill everyone else.
@Ninjastolz Saaaaaaaayyyyyyyy....

Visited both @HHComics and @VariantEDmonton for Free Comic Book Day, and an evening viewing of Avengers tonight! #Nerdlife
@pau1wa11ace @NelsonNiwa @worstninjaever Napping is a young man's game, OLD MAN!
@pau1wa11ace @NelsonNiwa @worstninjaever 
@pau1wa11ace @NelsonNiwa @worstninjaever Please. I could out nap you all.
@worstninjaever Dammit, Stan, learn from @pau1wa11ace's mistakes!
It's been a long afternoon for little @worstninjaever. 
@worstninjaever @pau1wa11ace Paul, first rule of Nap Club is that we DON'T talk about Nap Club!
@scottybomb @worstninjaever Still on for Earl's at 6ish?
@scottybomb @worstninjaever But I'm down for dinner.
@scottybomb @Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Dev's helping out for FCBD until 6+, so will meet us in line.
@DiegoatYEG @worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth I never read her Avengers appearances. I do like Storm, Queen of Wakanda.
@worstninjaever @DiegoatYEG @Doctor_Teeth YOU know my ambivalence towards the NFL and affiliated comic book tie-ins.
@worstninjaever @DiegoatYEG @Doctor_Teeth YOU DO NOT GET TO TALK ABOUT US1 THAT WAY!
@worstninjaever @DiegoatYEG @Doctor_Teeth Now now, let's not go about saying things that we can't come back from.
@worstninjaever @DiegoatYEG @Doctor_Teeth Triathlon was a big part of Busiek's run in the early 2000s.
@VariantEDmonton How's the parking around there today?
Let's hope the hour in the meter is good enough. #FCBD2015 @HHComics 
I will be heading out for #FreeComicBookDay shortly, but first I have to celebrate #ExpensiveGlassesDay.
@scottybomb  
@cameronMstewart Wait, that's the kid from Attack the Block?
@topatoco @wigu Bah! I was twelve hours too early!
@benito_cereno There's a monster lifestyle?
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: The only movie where you'll see an ape with a machine gun riding a horse facing off against a tank.
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever We'll have at least an hour in line.
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever I'd say Herc's a better Avenger than Teenaged Iron Man as well.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth They were wrong from the very first ranking. Herc deserves more, but probably not based on his Avenger role.
@RNSrobot @worstninjaever I could be down with that.
@nataliemorales Pig in the City and Mad Max can be compared.
@SUNBreakenridge There IS no counterpart to you, Dave. They all pale in comparison. #suckingup (I don't need tickets, I'm just being a jerk)
@DanicaHere I'm sure you guys can watch it tomorrow afternoOoohhahahahahaaaaa.
@DanicaHere But I won't tell you the point where I started screaming at the TV in nerd excitement.
@DanicaHere Nothing that really would catch you off guard if you go into AoU with some knowledge of the Phase 2 movies.
@DanicaHere did you guys watch Agents of SHIELD this week?
@DanicaHere SPOILER LASERS!
@GOODNESSaidan &lt;points at Aidan&gt; SPOILERS!
@NelsonNiwa @worstninjaever You're right, Nelson, I AM pretty great!
@worstninjaever @NelsonNiwa 100% of mine endnup with me thinking "God, I'm the wittiest motherfucker on planet Earth." #includingthisone
@Doctor_Teeth Hooray!
I just earned the 'Pale as the Moon (Level 5)' badge on @untappd!

@thefirstjoel Wait, you think you're invited? They're expecting a quartet! =)
@nitabing @TheJordanWard Ehhhh, do whatever you want.
@Much @ScottAukerman @ComedyBangBang Hooray! Season 4!
@AdamTwoNames I believe the "joint" part.
@AdamTwoNames Who was spooning?
@AdamTwoNames Did she face plant into pudding? What the hell, Adam?
@RoundTableLaw Bell's upgrading me to an S4. It's been longer than they estimated.
@Leask Seven.
@nitabing @scottybomb @worstninjaever Voting's for chumps. #horriblecitizen
@scottybomb @nitabing @worstninjaever Kow's on Wed, either night will work for me.
Flock of Segways is the name of my New New Wave band. #calledit
While driving through the valley today, I saw a flock of Segways.
Based on the lawn signs, I think I'll be going for "For Sale" this election.
@SashaBanksWWE Blech. Mushrooms.
@RNSrobot yeah, I have to research that part.
@DavidUzumeri Yeah, the future is now.
@britl YOU'RE a fever dream!
@britl Yes! I saw you and talked to you at @VariantEDmonton!
@britl are you back in Calgary again?
@bclevinger @Scott_Wegna I just finished Vol 8 of Robo.  Goddammit, you guys. I laughed so hard.
@worstninjaever @mspixieriot Guys. The rules are one lady, one black person, one asian person.
Dubnyk nominated for the Vezina, huh? Goddammit, Oilers.
@Draft6isblue @apocalypsekow Dammit, Rick, just because we had a successful show despite me losing my voice doesn't mean we want it.
@Wheeler More dancing bear posts, please.
@soupytoasterson This office has a lot of my bloodstains on office equipment. Things are sharp.
@KurtBusiek You're the cinnamon bun @MarkWaid.
@MattBesser What was/is your favourite dinosaur?

@worstninjaever @underexperiment I kind of lost the plot of the whole right hand, but whatever.
@Doctor_Teeth @Ninjastolz Also, I found a Scotland Parks website that gives access to castles.
@worstninjaever @underexperiment "L is for loser, which only I can see. Backwards L is for Waluigi, who I really want to be."
@Ninjastolz @Doctor_Teeth Never. What's Roundwood?
@underexperiment @worstninjaever Okay Jago, you can do this. Do NOT make an easy  Chinese L/R pronunciation joke. WILLPOWER!
@RowanKaiser It's a little long, but there's not one wasted line in that movie. EVERYTHING is paid off.
@clarebelford What?
I just earned the 'The Great White North  (Level 21)' badge on @untappd! 
I just earned the 'New Brew Thursday (Level 3)' badge on @untappd! 
Happy birthday to @mcmillan_music!
@Doctor_Teeth I hear that! We need a CLEANSING! HELLfire and BRIMstone!
@AndyRichter How often would you need to replace them?
@GOODNESSaidan Well, there goes my restful sleep tonight.
@lauraniwa Maybe. Or maybe it's been designated as your task to judge the eyeballs. Middle management, most likely.
@lauraniwa It seems right to me that Atlanta has made huge strides in the dystopian future video market.
@underexperiment I just blame me not remembering that on my left-handedness.
@kalebd heh.
@kalebd and then it jumps to one I've already heard.
@kalebd Yeah, in Apple Podcasts, the order is always newest to oldest. But if I have a few to go through, I choose the oldest unlistened...
@kalebd Sure, but don't you just choose thee newest ep from the list anyway?
@hermanos Alison is my favourite clone.
@nitabing Pizza cats?
Seriously, Apple, who the hell listens to podcasts from newest to oldest? Why do I have to manually change that per podcast?
@LeConstable Time for you guys to buy a dog trampoline.
@1ofakind_Ivy I've had about fifteen years of "treat yourself."
@starkersinyeg I've seen some issues at @NextActPub.
@Doctor_Teeth Champion, the Drinker!
This is the most House Hunters International synopsis I've ever seen. I'm going for a long walk. 
@britl Yaaaaaaaayyyyy!
@Wheeler Stop drooling on your phone. Water damage is no joke.
@DanicaHere @Leask And now that I've shouted "Lick" a bunch, let me start to lick things!
@DanicaHere @Leask Lick! Llllick! Lllllllllllllick!
@DanicaHere @Leask Did somebody say Jago?
@worstninjaever @thefirstjoel Everything's funnier when associated with my butt.
@jayrunham @britl Worst Dick Tracy name ever.
@britl @jayrunham Pimples never gets a fair shake online. Not like his sister Dimples.
@jayrunham @britl Hey, Pimples Jago is my cousin, and it's a name from the old country!
@britl Sorry to hear that. I hope it clears up at some point.
@sarahjanet 4 feet or so. Enough to wrap around my head about three or four times.
@britl It's live living just off Whyte in '06.
@Dalby Yes, I'm sure people find them cute, but it's nothing to build a persona on.
An hour ago watching #daredevil: "I was not expecting THAT!"
Just now: " I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT!"
@RaeBeta I've been saying that for years.
Daredevil: the story of how a law firm became alcoholics.
I just earned the 'Fruits of Your Labor' badge on @untappd! 
@chrissyteigen How does one sync their nips?
@worstninjaever @sarahjanet I dunno, I could watch Anna Kendrick in a "I love Emily Blunt" TShirt lip syncing for a half hour.
@craddo Daredevil would totally be a Rangers fan.
@mspixieriot @worstninjaever Every time you hear us going "Ohhhhhh!", look away.
@mspixieriot @worstninjaever should record us watching it, and then run the audio about five seconds early.
@thetrentwilkie 
Dreamed I was on a trip to New York where I ran into @MattBesser and @mrmattwalsh baby birding each other for street improv.
Happy birthday to one of my best elementary school friends, @PaulLandryCA!
@kirbykrackle It's cool. Just come back to Edmonton.
My glasses salesperson was Asian Kate Micucci.
@Matlhias What a world, when you decide to record yourself for some reason when you're innocently attending a con panel.
@Matlhias Cool, I'll be sure to tell your impression to my friends on the panel.
@ryzshrn AAAAAHHHHHHH! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!
@Matlhias That 30 second clip did, yes. Have you heard the full hour?
@Matlhias Fact is, I wasn't there. Neither were you. Was it just that one incident? No clue.
@Matlhias I've been to panels where someone tries to derail the conversation to their own deal. It's disruptive and awkward as hell.
@Matlhias In a panel that's supposed to be Women Into Comics? It's off-topic.
@GOODNESSaidan Aaaaah, there we go.
@beatonna Yeah, that's about right.
@GOODNESSaidan @prograpslady sorry, what does that shirt say? "Can I cake? Yes you can"?
@starkersinyeg @lou_reid It was a funnier word than peeing.
@methos_77 @ApplesMorris @kmorris3000 Shhhhhh that confusion has worked in Keith's favour for 14 years.
@britl I'm so sorry. Those OUAT fanatics are a rabid bunch.
@lou_reid @starkersinyeg More accuracy when talking about drunk pooping, please.
@lesmcclaine Three days. He keeps on breaking the eggs accidentally.
@cameronMstewart Who WOULDN'T want to be in a Star Wars movie with Chewbacca?
@Matlhias 3. That clip doesn't show the part where a question asked to a Girls Into Comics panel tried to make it all about men.
@Matlhias 1. I never called anyone a fake gamer girl. 2. One of my friends was a panel guest, and I trust her account.
@DavidUzumeri Her boyfriend?
@Kevin_Church And that's why he died like a chump.
@GOODNESSaidan "She's a Bread! ... Hoowwwse!"
Never thought I'd be thinking "Edmonton spring weather is bullshit."
@JarrettMelendez Will do. You're on my timeline now, so I'll know what's happening con-wise, I assume.
Where the hell are the STORMS we got in Moose Jaw? The ones that made every intersection a lake for four hours?
Every time I see there's a rainstorm coming, I hope for a big one to get all the dust and dirt out. And I end up thinking "That's it?"
@JarrettMelendez Thanks for the convo, it was nice talking to you.
@JarrettMelendez Yep, I've definitely got to come out east at some point. See the people who can't come Western Canada-way.
@JarrettMelendez Yeah, that would be neat. My friend @Doctor_Teeth has gone to NYCC, and I was pretty envious.
@JarrettMelendez How's Boston CC for size?
@JarrettMelendez I want to do a US con at some point. C2E2, Seattle, HeroesCon would all be fun times, I'm sure.
@JarrettMelendez Yeah, I was kicking myself when I saw that Gerhard and Ennis were there.
@JarrettMelendez @Calgaryexpo @JimZub Yep, Jim's always a treat to visit when I'm booth walking.
@JarrettMelendez Yeah, you definitely seem to be very busy in the Northeast con scene. =)
@JarrettMelendez If it wasn't for @Calgaryexpo, I wouldn't have found Atomic Robo or Skullkickers. I'm grateful for the times I've been.
@JarrettMelendez But on that list, I see maybe five people I go OOOH about. And like three of them I haven't met before.
@JarrettMelendez I mean, the line-up's not bad for comics creators. 
@JarrettMelendez And Calgary's got a decent enough local rep for comics, but when I'm looking for sketches, I want some people I read.
@JarrettMelendez Yeah, I've got friends in the con organizing business. Wouldn't want that job for a minute.
@JarrettMelendez But it's almost TOO big these days.
@JarrettMelendez It's great that Calgary's a success. It's made it so there's successful cons in other Prairie Canada cities.
@JarrettMelendez ...it's sad to see two or maybe three names you're excited to see.
@JarrettMelendez But when you've met Perez, Beaton, Sakai, O'Malley, etc. at previous years...
@JarrettMelendez I understand. Bottom line is bringing in TV stars get more tickets sold than comics people.
@JarrettMelendez But being a lightning rod by GGers because they kicked a group out for misrepresentation? Not cool. Makes my blood boil,
@JarrettMelendez My reasons for not attending these days is mainly because the media guest have overshadowed the artist, IMO.
@JarrettMelendez It angers me a bit because it's the biggest con close to me, even if I haven't been in a few years.
@JarrettMelendez I'm all for them applying for a booth under their own name. I'm also all for Calgary Expo saying "No thanks,"
@JarrettMelendez This might inform you: 
@JimZub Niiiiice.
@sarahjanet Can I say ladies in an MRA group makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever?
@sarahjanet Sorry, were you guided to the Reddit site because of the Calgary Expo stuff?
@sarahjanet Was it about the Calgary brouhaha?
@sarahjanet You know, I've been complaining since October online with nothing to show from it. Guess it's because I'm a guy.
@JimZub How far away from the Stampede grounds did they put you?
@tvoti The 80s series is the only one I'm familiar with. #zitremedyforever
@coconewt @apocalypsekow @Doctor_Teeth Curse my Twittiquette when it comes to group accounts!

@morgoid Stop the baseballs to your face!
Sure, like @AnnaKendrick47 couldn't get any cooler. 
@laura_hudson Pizza?
@hermanos Oooof, nice. The focus that always kills me is my core.
@thepwaoriginal &lt;starts to cry while eating an entire loaf of garlic bread&gt;
@hermanos But last month, there was a period of two weeks where it was travelling/sick/too busy/vacation. It hurt when I came back.
@hermanos Getting back on the horse! My workplace offers a boot camp for employees, and I try to make it every session.
@iCanuck @davecournoyer @kylafisher People in love are the WORST, Dave!
@joelcarroll Niiiice.
@kylafisher @davecournoyer What a hunk!
@JenKirkman I'm totally a lot more reactionary on social media than I am in person.
@JenKirkman Men are just too emotional to run for office.
@joelmchale I'd be down for an Edmonton show. I'm just confused why you're doing Canada in such a weird pattern.
@worstninjaever Why the hell would I sully milk and chocolate milk that way?
Okay, McDonald's is just half-assing it with the Daredevil cross-promotion. 
Netflix, I've got a great new superhero show focusing on the horrors of drug abuse. Can you give me 10 mil to produce D.A.R.E.Devil?
@lou_reid @starkersinyeg Binge watching brings out the worst in all of us.
@Bbbbbrandy I've got magpies and rabbits in my backyard, but I'm not sure of their style choices. They dressed me in Ed Hardy.
@Kevin_Church Wow, those bold lines make everything just pop.
@artistflop It's 2015. Everything's a thing.
@scottybomb @RNSrobot @Doctor_Teeth True. I'm willing to let something go since it's DD Year One.

@injunmutt Well, I'd come for a show, but the commute to that theatre is a bit long.
@injunmutt Ontario?
@scottybomb @nitabing @Doctor_Teeth And of course, I love you, Rosario Dawson.
@scottybomb @nitabing @Doctor_Teeth I'm only an ep ahead of you. But am loving the fight choreo. Not so sure about the torture of that guy.
Watched the first three episodes of #Daredevil last night. Solid show so far, and a great intro to Marvel's street heroes.
@scottybomb @nitabing Yep. It's a bit weird for the first few episodes.
@lou_reid @starkersinyeg I could see that, considering you called me a coward for not being able to watch more than four Hannibals in a row.
@tvoti It IS the home of Deadwood.
@LiamCreswick I find you plenty funny. Unless it's the other aspects of the job...
@tanis_eh @bingofuel Yeah, teens are the worst.
@ejaynie Yeah, playoff hockey positioning is exciting, I guess. &lt;dries tears with Oilers jersey&gt;
@MichaelSweetser @StillHadThese 
@MichaelSweetser @StillHadThese I will never watch the show, even to hate watch, but at least Fat Neil and The Beek are getting paychecks.
@MichaelSweetser @StillHadThese Just think of the average viewer of CSI. Now think of what kind of tech speak they can handle.
@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser But guys! One of the computer techs can't track a signal because the bad guy is "using an algorithm!"
.@Leask Wrestling John Cena in the streets, Bedtime John Cena between the sheets.

@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @nitabing On The Bachelor! Things get streamy! They also get dreamy and steamy! #creamy
@RenaissanceDork @scottybomb @nitabing I can do it. It might be streamy.
@LanceStorm Oh man, Molson Ice...
@Leask You have it. Is it still the not-full selection that Rogers tried doing last year? Or do you have the American version?
@Leask I got Stan in by showing him January's super show. I should drop the money for the Network now that it's on Bell.
@Leask Yeah, their banter is A+.
@Leask That semester you spent in Italy doesn't count, Rosa!
@Leask "We're European, so no?" What the hell's a frankfurter, Rosa?
@laura_hudson I loved Jon looking over his knife throne in the montage.
@joelcarroll It's not available in Canada yet. Dammit, Yahoo!

@tanis_eh What's your riding?
@tanis_eh Go Marxist.

@nitabing @lauraniwa It's all that sex with your husbands you guys have. Plus, your offices have replaced your birth control with tic-tacs.
@worstninjaever @soupytoasterson @Leask &lt;uncomfortably undresses, looking around nervously&gt; So you guys like, uh, comics, right?
@worstninjaever @lauraniwa What requires even more focus: swimming to the clinic.

Well, #pdx, it was fun while it lasted. Too many other eateries to try and things to see. I'll try to come back. 
@AdamTwoNames Have a fun time! I sure did! Check out Pine State Biscuits if you have the chance.

@Leask Luke is very much a dealer name.
Update from last night: Mom was tipsy, yes, but the in-laws were drrrrunk. Mom couldn't keep up.
Wait, my mom was too drunk to drive me BEFORE I LEFT EDMONTON???
.@ejaynie Don't you be asking for high fives!
My sister just informed me that my mom's too tipsy to pick me up from #pdx. This is grade 4 soccer practice all over again.
SeaTac, why do you not have water fountains? Are you in the pockets of Big Bottlers?
@ejaynie BOOOOOO! You're a bad influence and a bad daughter!
Eurgh. Never fly when you're congested,  kids. That flight into SeaTac nearly killed me. #scanners #headasplode

@ejaynie Do you guys have all the days planned for food? Because I want to check out the Imperial at some point.
@ejaynie Eurgh, Seattle almost killed me, portion-size-wise.
@soupytoasterson Good thing you've got a comic store to fall back on.
@ejaynie See you either tomorrow eve or Thursday!
@worstninjaever If only I had Animal Crackers on DVD.
@worstninjaever I've got two of those on DVD.
@worstninjaever @artistflop Sure, whatever hippie.

@Leask What did they have to say?
@Janina Schroedinger's Flight?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Oh no.

@matthewbaldwin Eh, I'll have to come in for a proper vacation sometime. We can meet up the next time I'm here.
The nice thing about an early morning #sea flight: seeing downtown lit up just before dawn.

@matthewbaldwin I'd see myself free on Tues around 8:30-9, after dinner at the Melrose Grill. Which might be too late for gaming. =)

@matthewbaldwin Just a reminder, I'll be in Tukwila on Monday and Tuesday nights, if board gaming is happening.
If you find my body dead in an alley, it was probably from that beer.
. @Doctor_Teeth thinks it's THE WORST, and I'm ambivalent but would prefer it to some brand name beers.
Oh it's on. @Doctor_Teeth and I are almost at FISTICUFFS over how bad/mediocre this beer is. #BeerScouts

@tomfowlerbug I heard Fox might rerun it on Saturday.
@Kevin_Church Who is it?

@canoeninja Oh, it's this one for sure: 
@morgoid She just favorited this now, which means she doesn't check Twitter! It's Morgan!
I think I just found my favourite Bob's Burgers song.

.@laura_hudson @Leask We spent a bunch of time playing a Winter Games-themed video game.
@bingofuel I'm sorry to hear you  can't sleep. I'm only up because of a bathroom break.
@JAndronyk But that one's now on eBay/Amazon for at least $4k.
@JAndronyk it's a lot more elaborate than the one they released two years ago.
@JAndronyk They came out with a Falcon about seven years back that I wish I had grabbed. 
Dreamed that I met @laura_hudson when she came up for the weekend to hang out with @Leask. But we lived in a seaside college city.
@JAndronyk My X-Wing and Slave 1 are sitting on top of the living room bookshelf.
@JAndronyk It doesn't hurt that this model is a real beauty. Next on the list, the new TIE coming out.
Aaaaand complete! Three days, eight hours! 
Boba Fett in the cockpit and hidden weapons compartments! 
Gotta love this model, @LEGO_Group!

@MikeonaMonday Tuesday.

@SUNBreakenridge It's also the place I forgot my keys in the trunk lock and eight hours later came back to a note saying "Look in trunk."
@SUNBreakenridge Yeah, that's usually what I saw when I worked there.
@joelcarroll My roommates LOVE NCIS and other dull procedurals. Drives me crazy, since my roommates aren't sixty years old.
@theisb Worse than Paul Wight?
@Lisaraniray But he's had treatments since Sept, and while he's no longer the handyman he used to be, he seems to be managing fine.
@Lisaraniray but he's constantly on dialysis. But the MM diagnosis hit me hard. My dad, with cancer?
@Lisaraniray How long was the worst of it? My dad's lived without kidneys for 12 years, so he seems like an iron man...
@Lisaraniray Well, it's awesome that you're able to live your life, then. I enjoy your Top Chef hosting duties.
@Lisaraniray My dad was diagnosed with MM last year. He's doing well with treatments. Is the cancer gone with you? How long did it take?
A few more hours, another portion of the Slave 1 built. Calling it a night, final stretch tomorrow evening!

Ooohhhhhh SNAP! @LEGO_Group delivery tonight! 
@NelsonNiwa @Doctor_Teeth @lauraniwa Guys, I'm getting a monster cramp in this arm I'm holding up for a high five.
@sarahjanet I think my biggest tears were for the tribute to Harris at the end.
@sarahjanet YUUUP!
@kirbykrackle Green.
@NelsonNiwa @Doctor_Teeth @lauraniwa Hiiiiiggggghhhh fiiiiiive!
@NelsonNiwa @Doctor_Teeth @lauraniwa  &lt;hand still raised, tears welling in my eyes.&gt;
@kalebd Yeah, I tried making my passport photo as well as I could, but with no glasses or smile, it was tough going.

@Doctor_Teeth @lauraniwa @NelsonNiwa Awww Stan and I missed you?
@Liann_Cameron Good lord, is that all for him?
@AdamTwoNames I'm going to report it so. Hard.
@davecournoyer Man, Dave, get better seats.
I was in a Sherwood Park industrial lot with 25 people watching @kirbykrackle. This might be the most cool I've ever been, musically.
@JenKirkman The spray kind, or the beaty clubby kind?
@kirbykrackle @mspixieriot We got it under control, Kyle! See you tonight!
@Leask @GOODNESSaidan TOTALLY hit your manager with a chair and cut a promo!
@RoundTableLaw @worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Is "ninja" okay to say when you're not a ninja?
@Dalby assault, even.
@Dalby I wouldn't result the guy, but I would tear a strip off of him for pulling his son's jersey and tossing it.
@sarahjanet Cut to a bare room, and Sarah rolling in fives.

One of my favourite Harris Wittels episodes of #ComedyBangBang - Farts and Procreation: 
So the first reaction I had to all these retweets was "Awww no, Harris." RIP.
I was just listening to the podcasts where Wittels was open and very candid about his addictions and rehab stints.
I just heard about the death of Harris Wittels. Too sad, he was one funny guy.
Happiest of birthdays to @morgoid!
@Leask @DavidUzumeri I am looking forward to trying them out regardless.

@JAndronyk It is! Thanks!
@cameronMstewart PD James wasn't a sexpot?
I said "Nope," closed the door in their faces, and called the police. I went out an hour later after they were arrested.
There was a ring at the door, I went to answer it, and it was these two lady wrestlers and a guy wanting to come in to humiliate the others.
Dreamed that I as harbouring some wrestlers at my parents' house that were hiding from a shitty abusive TNA angle.

@matthewbaldwin I WILL however be in Seattle for a Monday and Tuesday work retreat (Mar 9-10). Any board gaming happening those nights?
@matthewbaldwin I mean, unless you want Western Canadian news and obsessive bear tweets.
@matthewbaldwin I've been reading your dy and Morning News stuff since pre-Squirrely, but that doesn't mean you need to follow back.

@elimination1976 @nitabing I'm down, but they do have food to order there as well. Either way, my afternoon's free.

@DanicaHere Yep! It might not make a huge difference, but it should help.
@DanicaHere No, but I could help you upgrade that one relatively cheaply.
@DanicaHere Go to Acer.ca\support and type in your serial number to download the newer BiOS if need be.
@DanicaHere Ugh, your computer's old.
@DanicaHere that was Nov 2012 it was last updated, so you might not be horribly out of date.
@DanicaHere The splash screen should say was version of the Acer BIOS is running.
@DanicaHere So the latest BIOS update for your computer is 1.30. When you boot your comp, you should see an Acer splash screen.
@DanicaHere What model of Acer do you have?
@DanicaHere The BIOS is what boots up your computer, and out-of-date versions can grind your comp.
@DanicaHere Try updating the BIOS as well, that might help.

@contessabessa @Doctor_Teeth Devin has problems CONTROLLING THE VOLUME OF his voice.
@NWComedyFest Maybe next year!
@NWComedyFest Oh very cool! Sad I decided to not fly out this year.
@NWComedyFest Did Burress drop out?
@AdamTwoNames &lt;Backs a dump truck to your door.&gt; Here's the new shipment of podcasts!
@RNSrobot @thefirstjoel Joel smell like beer? That's what Jordan and Abby always tell me.
What day is today? It's @thefirstjoel's birthday. What a day for a birthday, now let's have some beers.
@Dalby Dawwwww who's a cute changeling?
@nitabing Cool. I'll get you a ticket, then. Is @scottybomb coming, or just you?
@benito_cereno Dammit, now I'm thinking about Cuban sandwiches.
@benito_cereno Not to keep on arguing over this, but I would be interested to see what someone on Mexican descent would say on the subject.
@chefcowan Until I'm able to come in.
@benito_cereno @theisb I've done hot dogs in a slice of bread before, but that's when I'm desperate.
@EricaFails DO IT!
@THEKarlaPacheco @benito_cereno @theisb Karla, voice of reason dot dot dot question mark
@nitabing Did you want to come? It's me and @elimination1976 so far.
Man, I done stepped into a taco/sandwich Twitter argument now. #thingsIonlysay
@benito_cereno @Spectre_X @theisb @McKelvie KOALAS AREN'T TACOS, BENITO!
@Spectre_X @theisb @McKelvie @benito_cereno Well, that's right there in the name, isn't it?
@Spectre_X @theisb @McKelvie @benito_cereno That is hardly a Nutella bread taco.
@EricaFails @theisb @Spectre_X @benito_cereno Yeah, a calzone is just a closed pizza.
@benito_cereno @theisb 
@theisb @benito_cereno Oh damn, a Boston court ruled that a taco is not a sandwich. You might have to go to a higher court on this.
@benito_cereno @theisb I dunno, Benito, I think Chris is on the right side of the taco sandwich debate. Taco shell is not bread.
@GOODNESSaidan Or is it just fantasy?
@scottybomb @worstninjaever @lauraniwa @yegfishboy @NelsonNiwa Kow. But we'd be free post 9.
Is this some sort of come-on? Or a plot to harvest my organs? RT @NikkiGlaser: @itsjago yes! They must be! Or come alone!
@NikkiGlaser I'll be coming regardless. But might as well put the word out there in case my friends are interested.
@nitabing Sunday, Comic Strip WEM 7:00PM.
Any of my friends interested in seeing @NikkiGlaser this Sunday eve?
@scottybomb @lauraniwa @worstninjaever @yegfishboy @NelsonNiwa Audible for Thursday Melvin?
@scottybomb @lauraniwa @worstninjaever @yegfishboy @NelsonNiwa That's RIFTS: AWOL.
@lauraniwa @worstninjaever @scottybomb @yegfishboy @NelsonNiwa If it's tonight, I just got food. I was just alerting for the near future.
@VariantEDmonton "Mail... cheemp?"
“@montanasribs: They're back! All You Can Eat Ribs. ALL DAY. EVERY DAY." @worstninjaever @scottybomb
@MrBrandonStroud @InspireProWres The XX Division? Niiiice.
My cell phone policy director is straight trolling me by sending out every single reply to an email, even if it's an out of office.
@worstninjaever My guess is complain?
@DavidUzumeri I enjoy her in Nashville a bunch.
@DiegoatYEG @scottybomb @Draft6isblue @morgoid DRAGO: Hey guys, what's happening?
I just earned the 'Brew Bowl XLIX' badge on @untappd! 
When I die, please smother me in @Canteenyeg's sausage gravy and chow down! #yummybrunch
(presses play on…
@jaimieatkins I usually one space. Two spaces seems unnecessary. Especially when limited to 140 characters.
@theisb It totally works if you mumble a whole bunch of words!
@Dalby How will she feel about the Puppy Bowl?
@THEKarlaPacheco Chocolate cruller???
@Leask Are you at the house show?
@scottybomb @NelsonNiwa @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever @lauraniwa &lt;drinks heavily before driving&gt;
@Doctor_Teeth @erinefraser @matt_bowes That is the third time this week I've seen a pic of that game.
@scottybomb @Doctor_Teeth @leah_literally @NelsonNiwa @lauraniwa March 6-7? I could make one of those days work.
@AdamTwoNames "Should same-sex couples have pictures of kissing?" SERIOUSLY???
@scottybomb @lauraniwa @NelsonNiwa @leah_literally @Doctor_Teeth I am down.
@scottybomb @worstninjaever @RenaissanceDork I'm free.
@DanicaHere I don't make the rules! Who am I, the patriarchy?
@DanicaHere Nope, just eating.
@DanicaHere Nope, just corn fritters.
@bingofuel Is there any food at the party tonight?
@worstninjaever &lt;pushes button&gt;
@Leask @DavidUzumeri Sean O'Neal, your snark tastes delicious, unlike one of that guy's steaks.
If I was to make "The Adult Adventures of @apocalypsekow," and had it about us doing mundane chore, would people get the wrong idea?
Stupid arms. Stupid shoulders. Stupid workout yesterday.
@worstninjaever @AdamTwoNames SIRENS!
@johnsemley3000 Aw JP Manoux nooooo.
@sarahjanet @worstninjaever He does love his Brooklyn Nine-Nine, though, so he isn't immune to Mike Schur's charms.
@sarahjanet @worstninjaever No, Stan was watching the odd episode around season three. He doesn't understand my love.
1-1 and the Oilers are finally hitting another gear in the third period.
Hockey timez with @RNSrobot! 
@DerekSheen Up here in Edmonton, it was about 45 degrees.
@RNSrobot Don't get me wrong, that finish made Roman look super-weak.
@artistflop Yeah, I realized google and other pages were still loading, as well as Tweetdeck.
@artistflop Looks like. I haven't seen that happen in forever.
@RNSrobot Well, he needed help after the Authority was eliminated. But he only won because dissention.
@RoundTableLaw @worstninjaever But the cross-section of the house is very Andersony.
@RoundTableLaw @worstninjaever I mean, Wes Anderson doing a kid's movie is The Fantastic Mr. Fox.
@RoundTableLaw @worstninjaever Yeah, I could definitely see the influence of the Might Boosh, which is what the director did earlier.
@RoundTableLaw @worstninjaever Have you seen it yet, Jason? I really enjoyed it.
@worstninjaever @britl Not enough unicorn fiction.
@worstninjaever @britl Beatrix Potter.
@worstninjaever @britl Berkeley Mel Blanc.
@britl @worstninjaever Brittney's last name is French for "The Beyonce."
@britl @worstninjaever Unicorns ARE wrong! NO NARWHAL HORSE SEXING!
@britl @worstninjaever How do you pronounce your name?
@worstninjaever @sarahjanet I have three hands?
@sarahjanet @worstninjaever The marmalade is also cursed.
@worstninjaever Bad news: Paddington contains potassium benzoate.
@sarahjanet I'd tell you but it's hard to talk with one hand in my mouth. Also hard to type.
@scottybomb @RNSrobot And of course, The Rock on deck to give him a rub.
@scottybomb Good for Ascension, now hopefully they can do stuff.
@scottybomb I thought the title match was amazing and only helped by Rollins. Divas match: Nikki's a boss, no story behind it...
@thechrishaley At the same time, it was a very enjoyable show until the Rumble.
You know it's a badly booked #RoyalRumble match when I'm yelling st the TV for Rusev to save this show.
BUBBA RAY???? #RoyalRumble
Not a bad match on this Pay-Per-View so far. Kudos, @WWE! And what a performance by Seth Rollins!
Now THAT was a title match! #RoyalRumble
@mastermaq Only SSD? Or just for your OS?
@NikkiGlaser At least with a selfie, you don't need to worry about someone stealing your phone.
@JimZub Every now and then, I think critical mass is going to set in, and then it doesn't.
@GOODNESSaidan Yummy.
@britl This just reminds me I should go back to @Canteenyeg for brunch some day soon.
@tomfowlerbug End of July, I'm pretty sure.
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever @NelsonNiwa Since three of us are here, why not at Casa Brago?
Godmotherfuckingdammit, Hannibal, what the hell have you done? #hannibalS2
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever What is this devilry?
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever Sure. I'm down. First box only, lest there be spoilers for the AP in the expansions.
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever Do I need to buy a deck for this? Or is it like dominion?
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever And then there's a bunch of new board games here as well.
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever If you want to come over after Brent's meeting, go ahead. I can take a look at gameplay.
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @worstninjaever  Brent has a bunch of decks as well.
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever ACG? Is that the card game?
@RowanKaiser "How DARE you not give an American hero five stars!"
And @worstninjaever gets his rib cravings deal with. #dealwithit #catinsunglasses 
@LeConstable Well, I'll join you, if you can wait eight hours.
@LeConstable You're not a dime out by yourself person? It's the best when you take a book and eat a good meal.
@LeConstable Or you could hit the Keg.
@LeConstable Ribeye, mashed potatoes, gravy. Asparagus with hollandaise.
@GOODNESSaidan That is an unusually high score for a hockey game.
@nitabing @Ninjastolz @Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever @scottybomb Go to hell, Anita! #badatcompliments
@Ninjastolz @worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Enh, it's a livin'. &lt;goes back to playing records with his pterosaur beak&gt;
Did I just drop a couple grand on company-offered shares? Yes I did, because I'm an adult. #cuethePursuitofHappiness
@theisb Yeah, but it WASN'T! HIS! FAULT!
@injunmutt @worstninjaever @lauraniwa @nitabing Hai!
I just earned the 'The Great White North  (Level 18)' badge on @untappd! 
@worstninjaever @injunmutt @nitabing Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
@KurtBusiek As a seven-year-old Tintin nut, I knew about opium smuggling pretty damn early.
@KurtBusiek Yep, way before diving in the the American comics scene, I was all over European comics. Tintin, Asterix, Lucky Luke.
@AdamTwoNames Man, if she gets more badges on UnTappd than me, I will be very unhappy.
@britl My hair mission: Make it more, not less.
@dreedge I'm a fat ghost.
@dreedge TWO FOR THREE!
@GOODNESSaidan Depends. Are you getting a dinosaur robot or a stupid race car?
@GOODNESSaidan I read that as "wanna be the pink ranger."
“@voxdotcom: 9 facts only Mathnet fans will care about 
@prograpslady @RamonVillalobos Calgarians.
@Leask Nah, my teacher never told me to pay attention in class.
@Leask And I appreciate that.
@Leask True. I'd have to search a bit to findy favourite self-contained one.
@Leask It's a good one, but I do love the Great Outdoor Fight.
@Leask If I was taking Achewood, I'd capitalize, even though he doesn't.
@Leask Tomorrow's cafeteria feature is roast with yorkshires. I felt the need to celebrate.
Today I learned not to do a roast beef dance in front of a meeting room made entirely of plexiglass.
2017 Pawnee is bizarro crazyballs. And pretty amazing.
So @Citytv's tablet app has a broken safety commercial that's not synched to the audio. So of course it runs four times a break.
@kmorris3000 No, but  it DOES start with an S.
I'm giggling every time I type in this user's last name into user creation. It COULD be because his last name is Butts. #Iam12
@soupytoasterson My two month unemployment certainly didn't seem like days after a while.
HATE RT @TumblrTXT: So uh…problem….since going to the gym i lost 4 inches…and iv lost 7 pounds. This is not cool. I want my fat back.
@pilotbacon It's 6 magpies in a Michael Keaton suit.
@zhandlen I enjoyed it, but man, was that one huge shaggy dog of a story.
@soupytoasterson You're at the point where the days all meld together?
@pilotbacon Ha, I watched it last night and was immediately confused by the mumbly first scene. It's a huge shaggy dog tale.
@ApplesMorris Yeah, I remember watching it as a kid. It'll be too scary for my nieces for now.
I just earned the 'Beer Connoisseur (Level 3)' badge on @untappd! 
@ApplesMorris Was it a sled?
Watched Birdman and Inherent Vice today. A lot of thoughts about those two movies. Enjoyed them both.
@GOODNESSaidan True that. My dad's going through chemo.
I think it might have not been a comfort to @nitabing when I exclaimed "OBEDIENCE SCHOOL! THAT'S what I was trying to stay!"
@leah_literally My life would be a series of arson cases.
@leah_literally Man, if all I needed to break off friendships was witty replies, you think I'd be friends with anyone we know?
@leah_literally Let's hear one right now, a sampling if you will.
@worstninjaever Ew.
@leah_literally I think it's a phrase that can be taken a bunch of different ways, which is why I chose it. I want to hear your jokes!
@Doctor_Teeth @contessabessa With a visual guide to ASL on the back.
@laura_hudson There are definitely areas I don't frequent.
#nameyourjunkafteravideogame The Incredible Machine 2.
@laura_hudson It's a series of pipes? Man, I've got to read this biology book more thoroughly.
@sarahjanet "She's great when it comes to picking up blocks, but hasn't mastered the potty yet."
@contessabessa Also, "Sorry I was passive aggressive when we first met" should be my Twitter profile.
@contessabessa Is it bad that I'm happier that I'm notorious?
@contessabessa @frndsWObnfts @bingofuel @thetrentwilkie Sorry my first encounter was p/a. I'm friends with Adam, Trent, Devin and others.
@frndsWObnfts @bingofuel @contessabessa @thetrentwilkie Oh, So Andrea has TWO Twitter accounts to argue with Adam. Gotcha.
@kurtbraunohler That flush is sublime timing.
@bingofuel @frndsWObnfts @contessabessa @thetrentwilkie How often is this account going to be conversation with yourself, Adam?
@theisb Thanks for giving us a warning.
@THEKarlaPacheco Is a martini just an olive delivery device for you?
@Leask @jayrunham I call my newborn third niece "The Squeakquel".
@jayrunham what about "squeakquel"?
@soupytoasterson Which one? KYLE or JAGO? Both are losses, in my opinion.
@GOODNESSaidan Is it true? Do feminists have colder hands than non-feminists?
Got my gas at 69.4 cents/l tonight, before the prices go back up. When's the last time I was able to fill up for just over $25?
@GOPTeens It got a Razzie nomination, does that count?
@sarahjanet Just think of it as having a side of penicillin with your sandwich.
@kmorris3000 NOT ENOUGH LIKE SHOWERING! Although I could always use "What A Feeling" more often.
@drdancergirl Good question. Since I tend to zone out during my daily routine, maybe I should call myself a master of shower zen.
I wish I could be well off doing what I love. Anybody know if "showering consultant" is a thing?
@drdancergirl True. Two days in Grand  Cayman is not enough.
@drdancergirl Ah, gotcha. I'm still enjoying your updates regardless.
@drdancergirl Is this year just a straight vacation for you?
@MikeonaMonday Where are we going? #higher
@worstninjaever @injunmutt Hey Sheldon, what's the ratio of bear fights in your play?
@worstninjaever Yeah, @leah_literally twigged me to it. And @injunmutt's involved as well.
@Draft6isblue I'm a sociopath.
HOLY SHIT the Roxy burned down this morning? #yeg
Got about halfway through Hannibal S2 last night. Only one visual made me look away. But then, needle to eye visuals are my biggest issue.
@lou_reid @Doctor_Teeth It took me a while to realize Dad had an aid because he's also one to ignore my mom anyway.
@Doctor_Teeth It was weird when I realized Dad was wearing hearing aids about a day into Christmas week.
@GOODNESSaidan While I like S1, the only chefs that ended up making any sort of splash were Tiffany and Harrold.
@Gentec_Michael When does dinner start?
@jaimieatkins Safety first, Baby Jesus!
@worstninjaever @scottybomb @lauraniwa @NelsonNiwa Birthday party for a friend.
@thegibble @elimination1976 On my way.
@jaimieatkins Baby Jesus on a motorbike is what Christmas is all about.
@daveshumka Your daughter will be this generation's Lisa Bonet.
@elimination1976 @thegibble we still on for tomorrow?
@Leask @GOODNESSaidan @theisb Yeah, four eps in a row on Monday for me was nightmare fuel. Couldn't sleep properly.
@lauraniwa @nitabing @TheJordanWard @scottybomb @worstninjaever Hey Jordan! Want my.shiny masterwork silver dagger? Or this dirty old +1?
@nitabing @TheJordanWard Piiiiiillllllgooooorrrr! @scottybomb @worstninjaever @atlblog
@SUNBreakenridge SHUT UP DAVE! Ohhhh you make me SO ANGRY! #unhappy
@soupytoasterson Is that box being shipped to Abu Dhabi?
@Leask What did you think? I enjoyed the time I had there. But is it aboriginal food for white people?
@Leask Have you tried Homefire Grill, James?
Literally looked at some instructions for creating PowerPoint video, saw 4:3 formatting and thought "What am I, a CAVEMAN?"
@nitabing @scottybomb Alert! This week's Agent Carter is a two-hour two-parter. Plan accordingly.
@mig14 If only I had James Spader's tones.
Why is my inner soundtrack today "I've Got No Strings?"
@toteschizzle Why do you only live in airports these days?
@Leask The only dumb thing is that no flights within that week are on sale. Wed-Wed is the saliest.
@Leask AC has a seat sale right now. TO May 13 departure May 20th return for $484 with fees and taxes.
@pau1wa11ace You used to have more hair, too.
@NikkiGlaser Looking forward to your weekend in Edmonton!
@sarahjanet She's also on @worstninjaever's "would switch teams" list.
@GOODNESSaidan Kingsman? I'm really looking forward to it now.
@LiamCreswick Shrimp on a hot dog? Crazy.
@Kevin_Church For some reason, that song twigs my memory.
@thegibble @elimination1976 Sure.
@thegibble I'm free tomorrow eve. And Sat aft.
@thegibble Because I wouldn't mind watching it at some point in the next while.
@Dalby Also, fifteen minutes. It takes longer to board.
@thegibble Are you planning on keeping the show for a bit?
@Dalby stop smuggling stuff in her diapers.
@Leask Because Westjet just announced some sales.
@Leask When?
@sarahjanet Bury her in toys tomorrow.
@MikeonaMonday Time for a garage.
@chrissyteigen It's got dual citizenship.
@KennyVLimaC Ha! I assume someone forgot to switch accounts before hitting send.
@howenmas I feel old when I see what Chandler looked like in S1.
@toteschizzle At least you had "but I'm doing school!" as an excuse. I couldn't get to Seattle to train some call center techs.
@toteschizzle They thought I was taking jerbs away from Murica.
@toteschizzle The lounge might have made my day better. The two hours being grilled by border security pissed me off for a month.
@toteschizzle The worst I've ever done was seven. And that drove me crazy. Granted, they didn't let me cross thge border then...
@toteschizzle Fifteen hours? What the hell?
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Hug Chantal for me.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth It's been like four years since I've seen it, so I'll take your word for it.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Suure you are.
@DavidUzumeri Hooked on Sonics?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Hm. Rhymes with both "phlegm" and "cough." This is a brain teaser.
@sarahjanet Is Friends another name for True Detective?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Cells comma Stem?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth REM?
@JAndronyk Have a great time!
@elimination1976 I was pooping.
@nitabing go to bed!
@worstninjaever go to bed!
@anyGould Well, there are only two time zones that matter after the end of the day hits us.
I just earned the 'Happy Brew Year (2015)' badge on @untappd! 
And by "loved ones," I mean my True Detective DVDs.
Should I stay in tonight to avoid driving? Seems lame, but I've got my loved ones around me.
@jeffparker That will be very handy during The Great EMP Wipe of May 2015. The man with backed up data is king.
@pilotbacon Wouldn't that get itchy?
@chefcowan Oh my.
@yegmotto @britl Man, I can't wait until Brit gets to the point where there's nothing redeemable about Walter.
@scottybomb Are you back now?
@bingofuel Evolutions. Got
it.
@Xeryfyn @worstninjaever Stan's the confused one, not us. I hope.
*falcon bursts in*
*pecks out eyes*
*back at lair*
*displays next to …
@worstninjaever Four years. We've all been talking about it behind your back.
Uncle Kyle and his nieces. 
@Leask I know it's different, but what were your thoughts on Scalped?
@joelcarroll That Shanghai night scene is amazing.
Hey, it's my first pic with my newest niece Bekah! 
@DustinMartian Three days and then out is what you're saying?
@justenbennett Yep.
@ReneeYoungWWE @RonKillings Never be sorry for work dance parties.
@StreetCircusDan I'm going to a WHL game tonight.
@thechrishaley Yep, I did and enjoyed it.
@NelsonNiwa @pleiades42 Huzzah!
@NelsonNiwa @pleiades42 You might try Pinterest, where you "pin" things you like.
@AdamTwoNames I'm wondering if that mean both girls go for naps, or if you nap twice SIMULTANEOUSLY.
@sarahjanet It would only be cuter if there was a puppy poking out of the backpack.
@AdamTwoNames If you don't know why she's in trouble, YOU'RE the problem.
I just earned the 'Merry Brew-mas (2014)' badge on @untappd! 
@worstninjaever What's the name? Larry? Lrrrrrr?
@Kevin_Church well, he IS from St. Louis.
@Draft6isblue Actually, it's about ethics in Santa's sack.
@Draft6isblue I know! What's the deal with Santa ONLY bringing me a True Detective and a bunch of board games? Is he part of gammergat?
@Doctor_Teeth Yum! Fruit based or custard based.
Mom has labeled her Robo Rally pawn with left and right labels. Is that cheating, gamer friends? 
@scottybomb You got our group gift, I assume?
@HappyElishas What's the ratio of marshmallows to chocolate there?
@tomfowlerbug Niiiiice!
<MUSICAL NOTE>I'll have a fluuuuuu Christmas in Moose Jaw... <MUSICAL NOTE>
@sarahjanet Well, yeah. You don't want Santa to get LCD burn.
@thepwaoriginal Have a Bojack Horseman Winter Spectacular, buddy!
@AdamTwoNames @worstninjaever He might have been brought by my hashtag.
@BeeRich33 @AdamTwoNames @worstninjaever Yep. My deadpan humour doesn't translate online to people who don't know me.
Seasons Greetings and Merry Christmas from my friend Matt the Bear and me! 
@kalebd @worstninjaever I'm sure you could get a decent-priced variation in Detroit.
@AdamTwoNames @worstninjaever Oh I see, Stan gets tagged because he's Chinese? #racist
@Dalby Well, WEM Lower wasn't eight years. That was only three or so.
@Dalby Eiiiiight yeaaaaars.
@MikeonaMonday You hitting Edmonton this Christmas?
@JAndronyk Once you're done that one, you would check out the 3DS sequel.
@anyGould Whaaaaaat???
Guys, @jeffparker gets me. #batman66 
@Leask Wow, my thoughts are with you for the next few days. Hope she has a good recovery.
@theisb #perfectpanels .
Hello, Moose Jaw! 
@kalebd I'll be there tomorrow.
@thegibble @RNSrobot @scottybomb @elimination1976 Mayyybe.
@thegibble @RNSrobot @scottybomb @elimination1976 Next Sunday the 28? Out of province.
@soupytoasterson Ah, gotcha. I dropped by the store yesterday to pick up some vacation reading.
I topped up my tank before leaving for Saskatchewan today, and almost freaked out the cashier with my $6.66 gas purchase.
@soupytoasterson You're done done?
@pilotbacon I hear good things about King of New York.
@Kevin_Church It encourages me to drink beer I haven't drunk before just to get different achievements. Sometimes I want my usual.
@Kevin_Church I usually just shrung and think "Hey, if that's how you want to use the app, go for it."
@Kevin_Church Every now and then I come across a profile that's pretty much only Molson Canadian check-ins with full stars.
@elimination1976 Poor impulse control from both parties, methinks. I was very thirsty.
Drinking a Big Gulp at 1 in the morning might not have been the BEST idea for past Kyle.
How sad is it that these kids are outlasting me at a Christmas party?
@NelsonNiwa @pau1wa11ace It's because that story didn't involve Moose Jaw at all.
@ApplesMorris You married the man. You knew exactly what you were getting into.
@ApplesMorris Which disc?
I just earned the 'The Great White North  (Level 17)' badge on @untappd! 
@davidlsims Same. They're a blatant toy grab, but as a six-year-old, they were my jam.
@davidlsims The big question is how do YOU feel about Ewoks?
Beer for Christmas! Thanks for the gift of @alley_kat_beer Amber, coworker!
@VanIsleBrewery Are there any stores in Edmonton that carries your brand? I'd love to share some Storm Watcher for the holidays.
@hbjbs @apocalypsekow I'd have loved to, but I made plans before the date was announced. Have a great show!
"My uncle's name's ALSO Gary!" #WorstDateIn5Words
.@NelsonNiwa Impersonating me would make for a worst date. They'd be expecting the genuine article.
Have you heard about #Kony2012 ? #WorstDateIn5Words
@thetrentwilkie @scottybomb Does the smiley count as a fifth word?
#WorstDateIn5Words "It's about ethics in gaming..."
I left my pants... Elsewhere. #WorstDateIn5Words
Oh @MeatForDinner, that pork chop I had a few days ago was amazing.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth @jmwforth @thefirstjoel Just work on those dance steps, Stan.
@worstninjaever @mspixieriot Yeah, hugs from me as well.
A new arrangement, @Doctor_Teeth @jmwforth @thefirstjoel @worstninjaever? 
@JimZub Man, that brings me back to smoked meat deliciousness. Love that place.
@theisb A variation on this: 
@katemicucci I thought that was your voice I was hearing!
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth For the last time, that's not a mace, it's a salad mixxxer.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth I'm uncomfortable with your packing style. You can't visit London in just boxers.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth &lt;is about to protest Stan's turnaround, shrugs, starts packing.&gt;
@worstninjaever But it closes on January 4!
@worstninjaever Let's go to London right now!
@AdamTwoNames @worstninjaever Well, yeah.
@worstninjaever @pleiades42 Sorry, I don't have four hours to watch security cameras. =)
@worstninjaever @pleiades42 I would LOVE to see you try to pull off a heist.
@davecournoyer Eurgh, a two-party system is something I would not be looking forward to.
@Doctor_Teeth Aww maaan.
@soupytoasterson Man, I just thought up a kitten and cross joke poster that would get me fired from everything.
@erinneo Have you tried Carl's Jr on Stony Plain Rd yet?
@RNSrobot No Vince interference? PPV bloat on the E side?
It's weird seeing pre-teen David Krumholz and Mercedes McNabb in this movie. #addamsfamilyvalues

@DanicaHere I don't. &lt;tear&gt;
"I knew she was trouble when I found out she was a walking part of scissors." - @DanicaHere talking about legs that go all the way up.
I got here a bit late, but I made up the beer time like a champ. #beerandtv
@RNSrobot @thegibble @scottybomb Tuesday eve I'm free.
@RNSrobot @thegibble @scottybomb I know Ro's seen it, but what about Monday around 8-8:30? Or is that way too late for Scott?
@artistflop Yes, but how was the food?
Hello, three hours of sleep. You were missed this morning.
@Doctor_Teeth yuuuup.
@NextActPub I might have been sad we saw the last of the brisket donair, but this kind of makes up for it.
@DanicaHere I'm just fighting falling asleep on my keyboard.
@DerekSheen Ah man, I missed it.
@erinneo It's like a warehouse rave!
@MichaelSweetser Just do Rumble, Wrestlemania, Summerslam, Survivor Series and maybe two others.
@MichaelSweetser Man, if only they didn't have monthly PPVs to book around again.
Yep, that was me on @BTEdmonton asking "Wait, are we still going?" live.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Because heroin's a hell of a drug.
@Doctor_Teeth We make sacrifices for Bridget.
I've been awake for a half hour getting ready for my @BTEdmonton performance. Can't say I like this early rising.
@joelcarroll Awesome. I look forward to watching it with friends later on in the week.
@Doctor_Teeth Awww the helmet looks like marzipan.
@joelcarroll Good show?
@Doctor_Teeth @leah_literally @apocalypsekow Make it a drinking game. Every time someone yells at Jago, drink.
I just earned the 'Land of the Free (Level 3)' badge on @untappd! 
Overheard at Shoppers Drug Mart from  a kid throwing a tantrum: "MOMMY, I'M CRYING AGAIN!"
@RNSrobot @thegibble @scottybomb There might not be Kow on Monday. Let me check.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth @jmwforth @thefirstjoel I'll love you all tomorrow at 5 AM!
@JimZub +6 highs over here in Edmonton. Granted, that just makes for water on top of ice.
@Kevin_Church @MBTA Perhaps "Moon of Endor Breeze?"
@RNSrobot @scottybomb @thegibble Dev's Saturday Beer and TV starts around 2:30, 3 so I could make an early Sat NXT viewing. 11ish?
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever @jmwforth @thefirstjoel It happens. At least we had a successful show, even with a bumpy setup.
@iamstephbeatz @jennyslate Handsome firemen? You ladies are weird.
@itsjago: Although conflicting shows for @hannibalburess and @CraigyFerg is super cruel. @NWComedyFest
Wow, that's a pretty impressive early lineup, @NWComedyFest! Maybe I'll visit BC in February. 
@kmorris3000 @sarahjanet The raisin bran room is amazing!
@Kevin_Church Also, it's weird to hear her speak in a higher register.
@kirbykrackle Anyone claimed yet?
@worstninjaever @lauraniwa Those were literal death-eyes! How are you still here?!?
@worstninjaever @lauraniwa You just say that because Head 8 was a pretty girl.
@benito_cereno @theisb Tangent, but I was destroyed when I realized I was President Business in The LEGO Movie. #orderlover
@benito_cereno @theisb Because I want some sctructure to my games, and constantly getting killed by zombie skeletons was the worst
@benito_cereno @theisb Yeah, the game is whatever you want it to be for crafting and activities. I got bored and frustrated after a while...
@worstninjaever @lauraniwa And that baby was a total dick, so you're welcome.
@worstninjaever @lauraniwa Stop exaggerating, Stan. Future Jago was a robot made of only one baby.
@lauraniwa @worstninjaever Future Jago made a lot of good points, guys.
What was I doing driving the highway at 2:30 am? Hanging out with my buddy @KaiEnterprise after his fun concert.
Was freaked the hell out by the car following me from Camrose to Gateway Blvd. I was wondering who would follow me an hour for kicks.
@worstninjaever Well, Pole Position was an Atari game, and those aren't licenses that are currently being grabbed.
@RNSrobot @scottybomb @thegibble Saturday's an edition of Beer and TV, but i can see about earlier.
@scottybomb @thegibble @RNSrobot Yhere's Kow on Monday. Tuesday?
Made it to Camrose for #ASongForSawyer. Don't screw up, @kaienterprise! #Illbejudgingyouinalltheoldfamiliarplaces
@RNSrobot Currently, I could do late night Friday. @scottybomb @thegibble
@RNSrobot @scottybomb @thegibble Any plans for the next NXT Takeover on Thursday?
.@Doctor_Teeth: "Go fuck yourselves!" Me: "Okay. Give me... (Looks at watch) three minutes." #killedtheroom
@CenturyHG @ChefPaulShufelt The Parlour.
@MikeonaMonday Racists have feelings too, Mike. Usually hate, fear and superiority.
@Janina London-subway-transit-sexual.
@kirbykrackle Oh Kyle no.
@LeConstable It happened after hours, right?
@LeConstable Ohhh right. The lockdown. What actually happened?
@LeConstable ?
@gregpak "Oh yeah, Facebook? Then why do I have three degrees on my wall?"

TWITTER SAYS IF WE GET 1,000 RETWEETS, WE WILL BE VERIFIED WE ARE CATS WE CANNO…
@laura_hudson Did you just have a Sierra-caused stroke?
@soupytoasterson Hi fiiiive! #tipsyworkpartyjago
@Kevin_Church Why is Kevin Spacey so sad?
@Leask @theisb It was absolutely insane live. I was not expecting the pretty boy and a broken semi-retired man to do that match.
@Leask @DavidUzumeri "There was no such thing as political correctness" = "Nobody called us on racist bullshit back then."
My new work wife! 
@DanicaHere @Leask While I do enjoy subdued Ritter, like Breaking Bad, I really want Jessica Jones to be an extension of Don't Trust the B.
@TraciReardon I've been watching my hairline recede over the past decade. How do I come to terms with baldness?
@MrBrandonStroud Oh hey, the kid from The Goldberg's getting voice work.
Watching John Morrison Starship Pain  a puppy is the funniest visual I've seen all week. @MrBrandonStroud 
@ReneeYoungWWE Are those PJ bottoms, or just patterned pants?
@ryanfhughes When the hell was your hair that long? #canadiantirexmas
Mothafuckin' @ryanfhughes in this Canadian Tire ad!
One week away! Get your tickets from any Kow! 
Anyone want to join me on a road trip to Camrose this Saturday? Going to watch @KaiEnterprise sing for his son. 
@JAndronyk What are your thoughts on eyeguards? Or do you prefer red-tinted sunglasses?
@JAndronyk So what exactly will you be using your laser eyes for?
@JenKirkman I want to hear your full duet with yourself now.
@Leask Any luck?
@KaiEnterprise You still doing the Camrose concert on Sat?
@RowanKaiser It was really weird to go to Montreal to see this Mac's with a weird name.
@RowanKaiser The Québécois version is called Couche-Tard, which means Sleep Late.
@RowanKaiser The Circle K brand is owned by the company who runs the Mac's Convenience store in Canada.

@sarahjanet Adorable in a very tall woman doctor role. But compared to David Walton, she's short.
@sarahjanet Yep. She's pretty adorable on last season of About A Boy as well.
@JAndronyk Still in Edmonton?
@DerekSheen Just tell people it's beard cream and ass dye.
I wore pants for a grand total of five hours today. Sunday achievement unlocked.
@tvoti Wait, have you been to Moose Jaw? Is Sask travelling a thing to South Dakotans?
@sarahjanet Hero by Childish Gambino.
@worstninjaever Oh no.
@elimination1976 @Draft6isblue Christmas Shoes &lt;mic drop&gt;
@worstninjaever @AdamTwoNames Even better, let #Newbabytwoelectricboogaloo drink!
@bingofuel it is the best. 
@bingofuel Have you seen the Puddles version?
@scottybomb @RenaissanceDork @NelsonNiwa @lauraniwa Mmmm whipped cream bathroom.
@NelsonNiwa Yeah, I hate when that happens.
I just earned the 'Beer-giving (2014)' badge on @untappd! 
@worstninjaever @NelsonNiwa @nitabing @scottybomb We can walk though. If you don't like the roads, stay safe.
My drive home this aft: "What are you DOING? You're the WORST!" "No, I was wrong, YOU'RE the worst!" "You, sir, are also the worst!"
My noon workout turned out to be just me and the trainer. For some reason, I thought of it as a solo bolo. I blame @rejectedjokes
@wealthybigpenis At least we can leave our houses.
@britl that doesn't sound like Edmonton.
@DavidUzumeri Do they usually refer to you as "part-Turkey?"
Black lives matter. You're in my thoughts, #Ferguson. Stay safe out there.
Sting confronted Triple H at Survivor  Series, but before the show ended, he whispered "Happy birthday" into @elimination1976's ear.
@sarahjanet Obviously, trauma. Maybe something in the removed memory would incriminate the character or someone they know?
This giant water beetle has a mouthful of Wang. #unfortunatenaming #pathfinder
@GOODNESSaidan There's always hope. Don't stop believing.
@GOODNESSaidan God, if only. His head's not on the chopping block, only the rest of his team.
@Leask Man, is Chris Pratt in ALL the blockbusters?
@Janina I envy you and your core. I can't balance that well.
@kmorris3000 @worstninjaever Also, stop wearing onions on your belt. It was never the style at the time.
I just earned the 'The Great White North  (Level 16)' badge on @untappd! 
I just earned the 'Master' badge on @untappd! 
@worstninjaever don't worry. My next feat at level three will make you immune to my bursts.
@worstninjaever Without ghost touch bullets, what could you do?
@GOODNESSaidan Well, they've got coffee. They're reaching out.
@laura_hudson Shut it down, Hudson!

There's ASTEROID M in this game?? #LEGOMarvel
Oh man, my life would be ruined if Pley ever set up shop in Canada. 
@bingofuel @NerdNiteYeg I... Do not.
@bingofuel I am now very intrigued.
Give a bear a fish, he's fed for a meal. Teach a bear to fish, how the hell was he surviving beforehand?
@hbjbs aw, not the 22nd!
@RNSrobot @worstninjaever Tomorrow
I asked an elemental to open a door. How did I know it would be the door to hell? #pathfinder #somuchdying
@AdamTwoNames Sounds.like great advice from a man who abandons his children in the forest.
We are crying laughing at these dumb roffs like the Pictish Cow and throwing away the Grail. Also, casual discrimination against @lauraniwa.
If not for Excalibur, we could have had five knights die in one turn. Hey guys, let's get more than one HP each. #gamesnight
Camelot's not sure what to do with all these cows on the battlefield. And where did all the siege engines go? #gamesnight
@redneckmommy How did you trick him, exactly? "There's gold in that there diaper?"
@seanoneal I laughed hardest at the tag joke names.
@MrSeanCullen (chooses A, but keeps his finger on the page just in case this turns out bad.)
@DerekSheen Depends. Are you collecting Crankshaft and Funky Winkerbean?
@Doctor_Teeth @scottybomb @lauraniwa @Ninjastolz Board games are cool.
@scottybomb @lauraniwa @Ninjastolz @Doctor_Teeth Roller coaster tour it is!
@scottybomb @Ninjastolz @Doctor_Teeth @lauraniwa I'm freeish.
@worstninjaever @AdamTwoNames Yeah, what are you, some sort of displacer beast?
@tvoti Based on your longer reviews of TV shows you like, I'm sure 50k words in two weeks on talking cats is a no-brainer.
@Much Are you planning on releasing the longer online episodes that @midnight has on the Comedy Central site?
@AdamTwoNames Adam, stop misplacing your kids in the forest.
I am Kyle's acid reflux three hours free eating a Mozza Burger. #tums
@AdamTwoNames @DiegoatYEG Good thing I decided to detour after Diego's tweet. But I seem to have missed it anyway.
@DiegoatYEG Honestly, I just got home, so maybe? There's a fire dept vehicle outside Scona Library right now. That's all I see.
@DiegoatYEG I finally flipped out at cars blocking my left turn onto 84th Ave.
@scottybomb @RNSrobot @Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Works for me.
I'm at the airport picking up a friend. Yep, still a bit hurt from the whole "no border crossing" deal.
@underexperiment 27 is TOO COLD?
@RNSrobot @Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever @scottybomb Sounds good. I'm home after 5:30.
I just earned the 'Happy Hour Hound' badge on @untappd! 
@MrBrandonStroud @CMPunk I wouldn't put it past Walt Simonson. You don't screw with that guy.
@DavidUzumeri I just picked up LEGO Marvel, LEGO Batman and Batman 2 for $5.50 each in yesterday's Steam sale. Now I'm hyped.
@RNSrobot @Doctor_Teeth good thing it's not pantsless Jago on Dev's shoulders. Dev wouldn't like that too much.
@DavidUzumeri They did get thanks in the credits, but it wasn't spelled out that they were creators.
@thefirstjoel Who are these people you mention?
@Leask This is the end credit scene: 
Lego Marvel Superheroes and Lego Batman 1 and 2 for $5.50 each on Steam? SOLD!
@mattfraction I fell in love to him jacking it to a Monster Mash parody, but I'm not sure if that's something everyone identifies with.
@JenKirkman No, I'm pretty sure that's the "best before" date.
@tvoti NOW can we say that the gamer archetype is dead?
@scottybomb @Doctor_Teeth &lt;looks shocked, rubs eyes, still looks shocked&gt;
@scottybomb @Doctor_Teeth Keener.
@DiegoatYEG Also, I was wrong, that was apparently 1999. Still when I was living in residence.
@DiegoatYEG They never promised that the S Club party don't stop.
@DiegoatYEG Are you saying there ARE parties like S Club parties?
@DiegoatYEG SInce I watched MuchMusic occasionally in 1997? Yes. The ladies were pretty cute.
@DiegoatYEG Ah, S Club 7. Young adult singing group from Britain with their own TV show in the late 90s...
@pau1wa11ace did you check under the couch?
@GOODNESSaidan From a little Google Fu, I think it's when the WH shut down tours during the government shutdown.
@GOODNESSaidan NOT WHITE HOUSE TOURS!
@Doctor_Teeth For some reasons, I've got "Aaaapples, they're my favourite fruit, aaapples, they're my favourite snack" in my head.
@HHComics @MikeMcDevitt47 Mike, are you being the Yellow Peril again?
@HHComics @MikeMcDevitt47 Oh nice. I'm sure Mike gives you a bunch of book retail experience.
Vancouver, please reconsider the name of your art gallery. The Vancouver Art Gallery leads to a pretty unfortunate initialization.
@nitabing Have a great birthday off!
@jaimieatkins Nice! Where are you going?
@worstninjaever @thetrentwilkie "Of thank you good sir! Is there anything I can give you for helping me?" "...What about a cream puff?"
Oh wow, Williams Street. "Too Many Cooks" is quite something. Kudos to outweirding your other stuff.
Why yes, @MeatForDinner, I WILL have some vegetarian bears. 
@worstninjaever @MeatForDinner @scottybomb @nitabing @lauraniwa @NelsonNiwa I'd be down.
@RenaissanceDork @scottybomb @nitabing It just means there's more B99 time.
Watching old @CraigyFerg interviews. Brie Larson humming into a harmonica was the funniest thing I've seen all day.
@soupytoasterson Oh, are you watching 30 Rock?
@MrBrandonStroud What's the sitcom equivalent of being buried? Co starring on Mulaney or something?
@sarahjanet Now I'm just more confused.
@sarahjanet GPOY?
@krystopher @thetrentwilkie @SUNBreakenridge @edmontonfringe Teenage Mutant Fringe-a Turtles.
@thetrentwilkie @SUNBreakenridge @edmontonfringe Sir Fringe-A-Lot.
@jaimieatkins @thefirstjoel You're in Moose Jaw. Where is there to parkour, other than Crescent Park?
@laura_hudson I wonder exactly what "your political group" is. Women?
@DanicaHere @soupytoasterson How does that even work? Can Clark Kent cosplay Superman?
@DanicaHere Is Archie Andrews cosplaying as his own superhero identity?
@worstninjaever @DanicaHere No, no, no, iffy.
@worstninjaever @DanicaHere Max and I do both go through bear stages.
@DanicaHere I was also Max. It's kind of appropriate.
@franzferdinand2 @Kevin_Church Yeah, not downloading podcasts defeats the purpose of a podcast app. My troubles are minor comparatively.
@franzferdinand2 @Kevin_Church Is downcast worth the three bucks? I mean, I'm sure it's better than Podcasts...
@LeightonEngen Did you take your tablet on vacation with you? I'm setting up your Pro3, but don't know what you need.
@Thesixler Nice job on #BrooklynNineNine this week!
@sarahjanet I used to, yes.
@DanicaHere 
@DavidUzumeri Well, I know what I'm doing this afternoon.
@DavidUzumeri I was an early adopter of 1080p TVs.
@DavidUzumeri Calibration apps are a thing on smart TVs? Damn, that's something I should upgrade to eventually.
@DavidUzumeri Ha! My parents got a new TV two Christmases ago and last Christmas was when I turned off smoothing for them.
My new alarm clock recognizes daylight savings changes? Nice.
@theisb Kick, punch. Chris, it's all in the mind.
@JimZub That was playing in between movies at the theatre I was at yesterday. Man, Iwerks was great.
@Leask @starkersinyeg @lou_reid James, your Louise expression here makes me think you'd be a better Linda.
@worstninjaever @theinfiniteyums @AxlerTuesday Where was that at?
@LeightonEngen What's in Houston? Don't tell border security you know me.
Here's my Halloween night plans! @worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth 
@soupytoasterson Time for a new point of sale.
@MillerGabrielle Are you doing the hair buns as well?
BRISKET BEEF DIP! Damn, @NextActPub, you're ruining me on other beef dips.
@Dalby Not sports.
@Doctor_Teeth Is your Halloween name "I AM A PIRATE GHOST (inside)"?
One of my mom's FB friends thinks the CBC is just pulling Jian victims out of the woodwork to spite him. Yeaaaahhhh.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth I miss our days of having SO MUCH FREE TIME!
@chefcowan @ZoomJer @Macgyyver @lindork @DeluxBB @ChefPaulShufelt @ChefMPhillips @ChefTonyLe If you did, I'd try to show up.
@TVsAndyDaly I watched the Review season end as the third last episode somehow. I was shocked when Forrest quit with two episodes left.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Also, then you watch Lynch,  you KNOW it's going to go batshit nuts.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Also,sorry. I'm sure that would be surreal and freaky.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth So I shouldn't watch Twin Peaks with you?
@Gregair13 Fair enough. I'll keep on leaning on the horn in an impotent rage and continue hating humanity.
Hey, #yegtraffic! 104 St SB and 84 Ave is an intersection! Stop blocking the freaking intersection every day!
@theisb Man, if Panther turns out to be based on the Priest series, my mind would be blown.
Hey @leask, when does this World Series game go into multiball mode?
@worstninjaever @underexperiment Ah man. SHE gets let into America and shut blows up? I was just wanting to train people.
@britl Yeah, I think it'll take a week or so for me to stop being angry and butthurt. Just hope this doesn't kill my Portland plans.
@britl My director apologized for putting me in the situation.
Seriously, Seattle? Frost? Oh wait, that's right, I'm not IN Seattle this week. Thanks, Homeland Security. 
@GOODNESSaidan In this world, is monster trucking the same as now, or is it being run like wrestling?
@worstninjaever The fun thing is I'm certainly on a watch list now, so I'm not sure how receptive they'd be to me saying "just meetings."
@worstninjaever Bosses and coworkers.
@sarahjanet Not that I remember. And I didn't want to lie.
@sarahjanet I was going to train the call centre in some new procedures. Now, who knows?
Well, guess who just got rejected from entering the States? "You don't need a visa," my coworkers said. "we do this all the time."
@johnsemley3000 Other long term CBC programs have switched to new hosts with no name change. Granted, Jian was definitely the brand of Q.
@Leask At least I was able to change my flight for a minimal charge.
@Leask &lt;three hours later&gt; BREAKING NEWS! I had a sandwich.
@Leask Miss an international check-in by five minutes, stay for six hours.
@Leask BREAKING NEWS! I've been at the airport since 5:30, and will be here until 1:30.
I missed checking in by five minutes? You gotta be kidding me. Six hours in the departure area before my new flight.
@FlyEIA Do you happen to know how early the Alaskan ticket booth opens before a flight?
@radiomaru Casablanca.
Oh, this ALMOST works, guys. @MrBrandonStroud @tvoti 
@Dom_Kazma @davidwain Which part is the hairpiece? Is it the stubble? Did you shave or something?
@thetrentwilkie Chad Kroeger was set to replace Jian, but well, you know.
The live blogging of my #ExtraLife2014 day: 
@benito_cereno When writing that, I was wondering if I was doing the exast same thing with "verbing."
@StillHadThese Yaaaaaayyyyy!
@benito_cereno "Look, restaurant, I know amore is Italian for love, but you can't go about verbing a noun like that."
@MikeonaMonday But I don't have a kid, Mike.
@Doctor_Teeth Sorry to hear that, buddy.
@thetrentwilkie @JAndronyk Yeah, I could see starting a new char, but even then, I can't go more than 12 hours in an MMO without a break.
@JAndronyk I don't think I have it in me to play one game for 24 hours, unless it was Civ.
@JAndronyk A variety. Whatever you want to play. FB games, board games, roleplaying, computer, console.
@JAndronyk Thanks for the support, Jeannie! What are you still doing up?

@diorinix @Doctor_Teeth Is it possible to stream from Xbox?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth It went a lot better than "We should all convert to Jagism!" did.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Yeah, I was able to strongarm the UN into making me the leader last game.
@Doctor_Teeth @scottybomb I say game on!

@ApplesMorris What is that, raisins?
@sarahjanet Thoughts on Ello? I mean, I'm not going to be signing up for it, but what were your experiences?
@RowanKaiser Nice. I downloaded it tonight, and am waiting for Saturday's Extra Life to just go to town on that game.

tonight.
@Erica_Sigurdson Was the crowd entirely hormone-free?
@DerekSheen I'm hitting Seattle next week for a work trip. Any good comedy I should check out from the 27-30th?
@Leask @laura_hudson You really want to hear what Laura thinks of us, James?
@zhandlen I've got Wonderful Tonight running around my head for some reason.
@kurtbraunohler I laughed so hard at your @midnight Princess Party punching dance.
@wealthybigpenis Yep. A lot better than my Thnksgiving weekend in Calgary. 119.9? Really, Calgary?
@theisb Hunter shut Randy down with his old nickname, "Hunt Hurr Hell."
I'm raising money for @TheStollery by playing video games for 24 hours this Saturday! Please donate! 
@sarahjanet 35? A coffin.
"A Season of Charity" was just posted to 
@penny_miles Most of them could, if they knew what to do.
@worstninjaever you can. I'll be in Seattle.
I'm entering hour 12 of installing updates on users' machines. Please let me die.
Ten minutes to tell a user not to use the google toolbar to type in an address. Whee.
@bingofuel It was quite the rush.
@bingofuel I'm running around with no pants on.
@AdamTwoNames Stop wearing Axe Body Spray, people will stop puking.
@nitabing Are you sure it's Saturday? Because I'm got a shitload of ticket here for working people.
Okay, after going through a deluge of on call tickets, I see I've been on the phone constantly for... THREE HOURS? I need a shower.
@nitabing My day so far: 
6 am, how about an on call ticket?
8 am, go back to bed
10 am, screw it, here's ten tickets.
@DiegoatYEG This tweet is under construction. &lt;construction worker digging&gt;
@DiegoatYEG But 3D text is all the rage! &lt;this tweet sent from 1995.&gt;
@AdamTwoNames Dude, it took six and a half days to come up with the majesty that is man.
@DiegoatYEG @MeatForDinner MMmmmmmmmmmeat!
@Erica_Sigurdson Honestly, her set's going to stick with me for a while. But for the wrong reasons.
@Erica_Sigurdson Yeaaaah. That was... Interesting. I'm glad they had a pro to pick up the pace after that set.
@ryanfhughes Yes. As long as you're cool without living 50 more years.
@SUNBreakenridge @camtait @Editwithmouse Strong SUN Media representation tonight.
@Erica_Sigurdson Really enjoyed your set tonight! I laughed a lot.
@thetrentwilkie Ten more fart songs!
@dublinsomeday Because you'd be using it constantly?
@thetrentwilkie dang, the fart songs are out?
At The Ranch for the ATB Edmonton Comedy Festival. Looking forward to the laughs! (especially you, @thetrentwilkie!)
@johnsemley3000 Oh jeez. That's just not cool.
@RNSrobot @worstninjaever Kow rehearsal.
Booking a business trip to the States is THE WORST if you have no credit card.
@worstninjaever @scottybomb @bingofuel @Doctor_Teeth You tag me in a pun thread, you'd best believe I try to destroy it.
@scottybomb @worstninjaever @bingofuel @Doctor_Teeth I call it Assault on Precinct 13.
@scottybomb @worstninjaever @bingofuel @Doctor_Teeth Want to see the new screenplay I wrote about a street gang attacking a police station?
@thetrentwilkie lol. Legit. I think I'll be getting tickets for Thursday.
@thetrentwilkie But your comedy festival night was saying these media people have never done standup before! MEDIA IS LYING TO ME!
@RNSrobot 300km is more like 3/4 in city. About half on highway.
What's up, car? 300 km from a fueling in  #yyc and I'm still "almost full" for gas? 
"@JoshoMandel: @_AlexHirsch Hand-made balloon costume in GF's honor! 
@DavidUzumeri The nebbishy socially-awkward scientist is a 15. Not that I'm complaining about Simmons.
@Kevin_Church Where did you start?
@worstninjaever The curry smell was remaining from Christmas.
@worstninjaever Is the vacuum now curry- AND mustard-smelling?
The menu for my sister @ejaynie's Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks, @kylejchow! 
@Leask Which song?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Do Bud and Elvin ever get together to talk about women?
@Doctor_Teeth I was acting it out for Stan using the DVR pause button with sound effects.
Oooohhhhh snap, @Doctor_Teeth! The first Harry Potter's on, and it's the Wizard's Chess scene! Where the movie died four times in theatre!
@Doctor_Teeth Oh man, that episode. Back before Elvin realized he was marrying into a family full of sisters and Claire.
The ladies of my family are casting lots for my cousin Mel's casting scarves. It's getting competitive.
@RNSrobot @worstninjaever Jago and Stan are home now.
@ReneeYoungWWE The scariest movie I've seen this past month is A Talking Cat?!? Scary this film got made.
@Kevin_Church Yep. I almost started watching The Carrie Diaries because Ellen Wong was involved.
@RNSrobot @worstninjaever Not yet.
Oooh. Internal boss fight in my character's mind. I hope we're winning, as I can only do so much in here. #pathfinder
Well, I just searched a corpse, failed a will save, and @scottybomb asked me to go upstairs. Well, fuck. #Pathfinder #possessed?

Remember, #gamergate isn't about attacking women. 
@soupytoasterson @RNSrobot That guy has issues that aren't Gwen Stacy comics.
Every day on the commute home on 80th and Gateway, I think to myself, "You go get 'em, Sad Stay-Puft!" #yeg
On my way home from work, there's a costume shop worker dressed in the saddest Stay-Puft costume I've ever seen.
@worstninjaever @RNSrobot Back in my day, we didn't HAVE autocorrect! We had to retype notes on the automatic typewright machine!
@worstninjaever @RNSrobot Yeah, Maetian Manhunter is a pale imitation of Martian Manhunter, alright.
@Doctor_Teeth @Ninjastolz @RNSrobot I'll bring the donuts!
@pau1wa11ace @NelsonNiwa @lauraniwa @worstninjaever @izzagud @scottybomb @nitabing Fine, Paul. You're not invited.
@NelsonNiwa @lauraniwa @worstninjaever @pau1wa11ace @izzagud @scottybomb @nitabing I work in IT. All my shirts are nerd shirts.
@ejaynie Check my earlier tweets. The contractors in my building made a spectacular waterfall feature in my lobby.
My first thought was "Why are they power washing the front glass? Oooooh. Oh nooooo." #worklife
A sprinkler head broke in the reception area of my office just now. It was quite the sight seeing a waterfall against the glass walls.
@Doctor_Teeth @RNSrobot It's not as egregious as slamming Martian Manhunter, but Dev does love him some Plas.
@RNSrobot Don't wake the bear, Ryan.
@worstninjaever @sarahjanet &lt;Sarah takes a bath&gt; Huh, why am I so wet?
Just finished The Zero Theorem on it's last night at @themetrocinema. Glad I was able to catch it.
@sarahjanet Michigan, Massachusetts, Missouri, Minnesota, Maine, Mississippi. Montana is MT.
@DanicaHere @Leask @JoshYEG Also, Prozzak was during high school for you? I'm too damn old.
@DanicaHere @Leask @JoshYEG I just kept on losing my CDs. One CD booklet on the bus, one CD booklet left when my car was stolen...
@PaulLandryCA The Bow?
@izzagud @worstninjaever Come tonight!
@worstninjaever @themetrocinema @lauraniwa @scottybomb Yes, I was looking at the @themetrocinema site today as well.
@theisb @HighMindedMW Ah nice.
@theisb Two hours? No theatres showing it closer?
@bingofuel Purty.
@worstninjaever My mom and dad both have cells. Obviously, they are the worst.
@ejaynie "Kyle, an Erika Jago was just arrested for killing contractors down in Calgary. Any relation?" "Nope. We're everywhere."
@ejaynie Contractors are a whole different story.
Of course I bought this. No harm in trying a new body soap. 
@TheBanalStory @worstninjaever @nitabing These were all pre-game, Scott.
@scottybomb @nitabing @worstninjaever There is! But I wasn't thinking of takeout from @MeatForDinner.
@scottybomb @nitabing @worstninjaever We could pick up some SteakOut on 34th, or you could join us to get takeout. 
@scottybomb @nitabing @worstninjaever Burgers? Chicken? Smoked meat?
@sarahjanet All of them.
@nitabing @worstninjaever @scottybomb Maybe? What were you thinking, Scott?
@DiegoatYEG "Aladdin? Isn't that the retro Disney movie? From before cartoons looked more realistic?"
@Erica_Sigurdson Are you headlining any of the Edmonton Comedy fest shows?
@Doctor_Teeth @scottybomb HANGOVER GAMING TOMORROW, BITCHES!
@leah_literally Tell me about it. Good thing it's more of a reservation deal than "Hey, you know what you're doing next year, right?"
@davecournoyer I love living in my left-wing Strathcona bubble. But it's definitely weird seeing what demos show up in different areas.
@jayrunham @Aaaron_Taylor Maybe it's because as a kid, I was determined to suck out all the caramel flavour of each Pop before chewing.
@alexredekop 
@alexredekop It's a cliche for girlfriend-less guys in TV/movies to swear they're dating someone far away in the north.
@tvoti @midwestspitfire Clueless optimist with a rarely-seen vicious streak?
@Aaaron_Taylor @jayrunham I used to love Corn Pops as a kid, but it kept on scraping the roof of my mouth.
@alexredekop And now you know why "I've got a girlfriend in Canada" is used so much on US TV.
@MrBrandonStroud Battlewars is one inspired name.
@worstninjaever @theatrejunkiehm All I hear is your call for food, human.
@worstninjaever @theatrejunkiehm I just haven't found the right neighbourhood cat yet.
@theatrejunkiehm @worstninjaever I provide all the shedding and aloofness that a cat could ever provide for Stan.
@tvoti No, it's actually a rank in gymnastics. McKayla's similar to a black belt third level.
@1ofakind_Ivy Thanks for the heads up on that gig!
Well, the Oilers lost but I had a fun time with @jmwforth, @thefirstjoel and @ninoroy anyway.
What is this, "take your teammate to the penalty box" night? There's three Others in the bin when only one fought.
Why is Vancouver being a hot bowl of dicks tonight? One guy tried to punch our goalie in the head. #oilers
@PFTompkins @Varietopia Completely understandable. Don't work yourself to death!
Here we go! Two @EdmontonOilers games in two nights!
@MichaelSweetser Me: HOLY FUCK! THOSE CATS ARE TALKING!!!
Wish @scottybomb a Happy Birthday today! And don't mention his pocket full of birthday cash to potential robbers!
@cameronMstewart Oh, when he gets so disappointed in his scent that he just drops his stance cracks me up so hard.
6:24: At WEM buying new shoes. 
6:25: @RNSrobot: Wanna catch an Oilers game?
Me: At 7???
7:20: At the game enjoying ourselves.
@RNSrobot Are they pre-drunk? Not that that excuses them.
@GOODNESSaidan Extending towards BROMLEY? WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT ID THIS?
@Leask Whaaaaat.
@worstninjaever When you get back, TV?
@Kevin_Church @GothamPodcast Since that episode was entirely written by FG writers, as far as I know, I don't think it was a criticism.
@NextActPub Oooh. Is it possible to get it without mushrooms? I'm not allergic, I just really hate mushrooms.
@worstninjaever Yeah, I've seen them scooting by once or twice.
@worstninjaever Oh, Segway Commuter.
@matthewbaldwin When you're right, you're right.
@worstninjaever Heh, yeah, I remember some people at the store pitching that to me.
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Kaiju fight?
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Racetrack?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth You know I have a crush on every boy.
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Awww, but my shoes are all the way over there! &lt;points eight feet away&gt;
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Have you started yet?
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth WHY AM I NOT DOWNSTAIRS?
@daveshumka Is that football player going the distance? Is he going for speed?
@worstninjaever @bingofuel I'm in your bathroom as I type this!
@bingofuel  Where are you beering?
@britl @zdarsky Did you ask for the horn or was that Chip's embellishment?
@britl I'm not sure if I've ever had a gender swap dream.
@britl Depends. Was it a nightmare?
@britl Today, I'm cosplaying as lady  Jago.
@davecournoyer scary part is he doesn't even know this weekend is Expo.
@TVsAndyDaly I bet you they aren't eating thirty pancakes.
@whataboutivan Is Stu Hart shitting into a bucket?
@mspixieriot @kirbykrackle You hadn't met him at Calgary at all?
@apocalypsekow Oooooh guys! We can get the 
@scottybomb @jayrunham Dammit, R2, why are you trying to bleed your fans?
@scottybomb I made it to the next level with Carl SCORES! My next task: 100 more hits.
@kirbykrackle That must be the music section.
@zdarsky Be prepared to hate me. Would you draw bears fighting for my sketchbook? Willing to pay more if necessary.
@soupytoasterson @britl @jayrunham @scottybomb Looks like I should head to the Expo on Sunday, then.
@erinneo "Okay, class, let's just fast forward through the first ten minutes. NOTHING TO SEE HERE!"
@zdarsky Are you doing sketches this weekend? I wouldn't mind getting something from you.
@Leask I am also funky, spicy and umami as hell. #Ladies?
@britl @JayIsNotHisJob Unicorns are similar to rats, right?
@cameronMstewart My only issue with iOS8 is that my podcasts occasionally stop playing. That might have been the Hey Siri option, though.
Oh, hello Crusher Creel. #EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
@soupytoasterson Oooh, I might have to come by for vol 6.
@worstninjaever @RNSrobot @scottybomb @elimination1976 @thegibble Stop lying, liar. #liar
@RNSrobot @scottybomb @elimination1976 @thegibble I've been aware of it for months.
@redneckmommy Oh, is this at the hospital? It's making more sense now.
@redneckmommy and it was four yesterday as well? Why are you watching this kid again?
@redneckmommy What's the Frozen count today?
@LeConstable I am not. I'm fine not watching a Batman series the network promises features no Batman.
@morgoid You haven't seen those before? My grandpa's condo pool had that in the eighties.
@StillHadThese Get on board the JOOOOOOOOoooob Train!
@soupytoasterson @DanicaHere IKEA is for wieners.
@ejaynie 1. The acoustic guitars in certain rooms. 2. The turntables with vintage vinyl in certain rooms, 3. The shared floor bathroom.
@KaiEnterprise @SaskExpo Is this the year you finally get a Punisher skull on your chest?
@Doctor_Teeth @pau1wa11ace Miniaturized and shoved in a whiffle ball?
@pau1wa11ace Underneath someone in a crazy bodysuit?
They have acoustic guitars in certain suites. And retro vinyl with record players. #sisisahipster
I'm looking at the hotel that @ejaynie is booking for her wedding. You've gotta be kidding me, Ace Hotel.
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Aw man. We're going to have to put a bell on that guy.
@Doctor_Teeth Yeah, I'm a sucker for a WWII-era tribute.
@Doctor_Teeth Best dancing: Season four. And second-best music.
@Doctor_Teeth Favourite song: Season six.
@Cat_Lance @worstninjaever Wait, I'm not getting any money from this deal! What kind of pimp are you?
@Doctor_Teeth Sent.
@Doctor_Teeth Too big for Twitter. Is your Skype messaging up?
@Doctor_Teeth Man, there's a line in my latest promo that just makes me smile.
@Doctor_Teeth Maybe. I haven't decided if I hit Calgary for EJ's Thanksgiving Sunday.
@laura_hudson I laughed so hard at the reveal of the bandaged cat.
@soupytoasterson @DanicaHere Why do you never ask me if I want to go to Ikea, Brandon?
Hey @Doctor_Teeth! The Cosby Show turns 30 today!


@laura_hudson 1:02 pm. Panel ends.
@worstninjaever Still up for brunch? Or have you already gone?
@DanicaHere However, Netflix does have the spiritual sequel, A Magic Puppy, where Eric Roberts turns into a dog. Movie night?
@DanicaHere The highlight, though, was the reveal of the bandage job the vet gave the cat to save its life. So half-assed. So funny.
@DanicaHere Eric Roberts, the voice of the cat, sounds like he recorded his lines locked in the trunk of a car. While on downers.
@DanicaHere It is horrible. I'm not sure why I chose to watch it last night other than "I've got to see this train wreck."
@DanicaHere The cat can only talk once to any human, and the special effects were worse than Conan's Talking To Celebrities bit.
@DanicaHere I laughed so hard when it happened. This cat has talked to almost all the cast and so then they were determined to save him.
Cut to the cat recuperating after an emergency vet visit, with one strip of gauze around its neck. #atalkingcat!?!
Okay, this stupid talking cat movie made me crack up so hard. The plot complication was when the cat got hit by a car.
.@laura_hudson Oh jeez. I just found out A Talking Cat!?! is on Canadian Netflix. Dare I watch?
@kumailn How about the Reebok Pump?
@Kulap Congrats on hitting the goal! I'm glad to be a small part of it!
@itsjago "We are the A-Team...of getting subs." #Heterodox
@Doctor_Teeth @Ninjastolz It was forged in cold unfunny (for.you) fire.
@Doctor_Teeth @Ninjastolz I choose to believe it tempered our friendship into something better.
@NelsonNiwa @Doctor_Teeth @scottybomb Nobody has to take me anywhere. I CHOOSE to come with you.
@Ninjastolz You'd be in some esteemed company.
@Ninjastolz Kyle Jago: Judging His Friends One Podcast At a Time.
@Ninjastolz I'm on the non-supes comic characters. You're back on my good list.

@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser AND it's right beside a Bullwinkle's? Man, I'm going to get arrested, aren't I? #nokids #justloveshotdogs
@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser Ballpark: $150-200 a night.
@Dalby Little do they know they signed up for free Creed downloads.
@JAndronyk @scottybomb It's pretty nerrrrdy, wait I forgot who I was talking to, go ahead.
@Ninjastolz I'm catching up on The Listmakers. And I hate you re: your comments on 24.
Dreamed that my office was closing down and that all of IT was let go. I wasn't sure of my job status until the very end.
@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser I'd be there for five days. Not sure about the car situation yet.
@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser The office I'd be visiting is just off of Interurban Ave and Interstate 5.
@thefirstjoel @worstninjaever Sleepbeeing.
@worstninjaever I hate me too. How am I supposed to sleep prope-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
@worstninjaever I just had a nap!
@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser Also, Tukwila's about 15 min from most Seattle stuff?
@StillHadThese @MichaelSweetser Not huge? I mean, work's covering it, but I don't want them to hate me.
@MichaelSweetser @StillHadThese Hey, I'm hitting Seattle the last week of October. Any hotel recs with close access to Tukwila?
Dammit, @DinosThirdTwitt is going to be at @SaskExpo this weekend? Curse you, paying gig!
.@silly_dan @worstninjaever Oh jeez, Bruce Wayne is the plucky sidekick? PASS!
@worstninjaever ...is the Waynes getting gunned down outside the theatre.
@worstninjaever We're talking about a show where the runner said, "This is not a show about Batman" where the FIRST scene...
@LuciusFury @HHComics True. Good thing they've released a fix for that.
@LuciusFury @HHComics ...but just like a podcast, it's there to be downloaded. It's analogy is someone put a CD in your mailbox.
@LuciusFury @HHComics I thought my copy of the album I needed to download first. Yes, it's on iCloud...
No thanks. "@CTV_Television: Watch the #Gotham trailer”
I missed creating trouble ticket 400000 by ONE FREAKING CALL??? &lt;flips desk&gt; #itlife
Brick's playing at @themetrocinema tonight? Anyone wanna go see a film?
@worstninjaever @_youhadonejob I'm pretty sure you're not Sinosexual.
@HighMindedMW Cena's RAW goes for four hours. He's a masochist.
@DavidUzumeri Also, when's the last time there was no monster in a Doctor Who ep?
@joelcarroll Awww, that's an adorable Snarl.
@worstninjaever Sure. But not from up here.
@worstninjaever "For sale: Baby shoes. Never Worn." Now sleep.
@worstninjaever Once upon a time. The end.
@worstninjaever Go the fuck to sleep.
@iCanuck Mmmm, London Fog ice cream...
@sarahjanet I think you'll enjoy it.
Back home after a three-show day at @kaleidofestival. It's cool if I just nap in my car, right?

*whispers*
Karen. Karen! Don't make any sudden moves...he's back again. 
@thefirstjoel How do you think I became VP of my company?
@Doctor_Teeth @apocalypsekow @yegfishboy @worstninjaever Maybe Stan should just grow a few inches. #blamethevictim
@NelsonNiwa Nobody wants to see my movie.
@sarahjanet Give it two eps.
@Leask @jayrunham I would love to see Boyhood.
Had a great time performing at #kaleidofestival today. And more to come tomorrow!
@Ninjastolz So everyone was just eating garbage-tossed ribs, then?
@Ninjastolz I don't understand. Is this some sort of hobo dinner festival?
@Ninjastolz Where did those come from? What sort of waste-deep place did you get those from?
@Ninjastolz Wait, are you eating ribs from the garbage? Is this "Kim's Ribfest?"
Me, performing with @apocalypsekow today: "Hey robot, look out for that car! Safety first, robot!" #kaleidofestival
@GeekyLyndsay @britl For a second, I thought that was fried chicken
@nyeshajoyce I hear ya! Peppers are the worst!
@eugewarrock But I can see Tyler Mane in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan next week!
Dammit Roots, why is your shitload so expensive? You get something cool like the NFB logo hoodie and then charge $100 for it?
@worstninjaever @RNSrobot @thegibble @elimination1976 The Pizza73 Chambers Special was pretty good. Almost like a Hawaiian!
@worstninjaever @RNSrobot @thegibble @elimination1976 Allan was unable to come.
Had a fun time with @RNSrobot and @thegibble watching #NXTTakedown. A quality night of wrestling.
@soupytoasterson So you're ready for another vacation?
I guess I should let you all know if I get arrested in Portland for punching out people who annoy me. Please send bail.
I know, I wear walking caps and drink fancier beer, enjoy Wes Anderson and Arcade Fire, but I'm still a few steps away from hipster.
For one thing, it's in Portland. For another, the hotel they're staying in has shared bathrooms.
Is my sister's wedding going to be the hipsteriest one I've been to? Unless Zoey Deschanel invites me to her next one, I'm going to say yes.
"Hey guys, one day after the iPhone 6 is released, I happened to drop my phone and break the screen. New one?" Too convenient.
Leaving the house for work this morning, I drooped my work iPhone, cracking screen. Bad timing.
Forgot how much I enjoyed collaborating on a roleplay. Haven't had fun like that for a few years. @Doctor_Teeth @NewAlbertaPro
@theisb Roman Reigns, married to the ring.

@Leask Gotta get your boom money from somewhere. Why not social services?
@Leask No swinging in the apartment!

Two wishes... add in everyone fed and healthy. 

Three wishes... now we get to mustaches …
@scottybomb @nitabing How is there not a Hyrule pavilion at Epcot?
@laura_hudson Awwwwww yeaaaaaah.
My legs are alerting me they exist every time I stand up today. Thanks, workout!
@CRAFTbeeryeg @ToolShedBeer Maybe. How busy are your cask nights? Would there be some left after 6?
@laura_hudson So when would the day start? Wouldn't that make noon the new morning?
@laura_hudson Don't date magpies. They're jerks.
@ToolShedBeer @CRAFTbeeryeg Wait, a key lime pie beer?
@Leask Non-serious answer: England renames Manchester to Edinburgh.
@GOODNESSaidan My sister moved into my room hours after I left for university.
@Leask ARE YOU CHOKING ON BREADSTICKS, JAMES? COUGH ONCE FOR YES, TWO FOR NO!
@Leask Here lies James Leask. He died as he lived, choking on unlimited breadsticks.
Snow in September / What kind of bullshit is this? / Moving to BC #haiku
@howenmas Yes, it's been comfort food since I was a child. Pillsbury sells the dough in the refrigerated section.
@Ninjastolz @soupytoasterson STEAMPUNK JAGO!
@RyanParkers Just the occasional cough offscreen.
@RyanParkers Needs two more seconds of awkward silence at the end.
@topchefkevin You tell him "So do I!" and then high-five.
@soupytoasterson "The Kaiser Chiefs released the song "Child of the Jago" on their 2012 album The Future Is Medieval."
@soupytoasterson What do you know? I ALSO am set in the London Slums in the 1890s!
@ryanfhughes I loved my week in Halifax this past May.
@howenmas Wait, so a cheezy blaster is a weiner wrap with cheese? I was ahead of the curve, it looks like.
Hey douchebag leaving Lacombe at 10:30: The 2A is NOT a place where you should be going 60.
And for the second time this dance, the power went out. It's almost like a field doesn't have proper power generation. #weddingtweets
And now you can tell it's a 30-year-old's wedding dance, with the sheer amount of 1998 being represented. #backstreetsback #wannabe
Yeah, you can tell this is a Red Deer-based DJ alright. #weddingtweets
@leah_literally Yep, along with a certain meter. I was promised limericks!
LIMERICKS ARE NOT AABBCC! #weddingtweets #poemtweets
Hey wedding MC, if you say you're going to do a speech in limerick form, don't use running couplets.
Drove to the outskirts of Red Deer for a family wedding. That was a lot of side roads driving, Google Maps.
Power grid down at 109th St and 87 St. Businesses closed west of 109th, and the intersections are four-ways south of High Level. #yegtraffic
@Ninjastolz Which one? I really enjoyed my trip to the one on Broadway.
@edgarwright I also agree with @DougBenson that I would have rated Scott Pilgrim a lot higher.
@worstninjaever @nitabing @scottybomb @NelsonNiwa @lauraniwa Staked out the long table. How many tonight?
@leah_literally @RNSrobot @worstninjaever "My bed! I need that to sleep on!"
@leah_literally @RNSrobot How would Rule One work in #minimalismgame? Would @worstninjaever keep dumping DVDs on my shelves?
@leah_literally @RNSrobot I think even doing paperless would make me break into hives.
@leah_literally @RNSrobot But... but my stuff!

@kirbykrackle @joeyjojrshabado @kbiittner @EdmontonExpo If you were looking for an a cappella group to back you up...
@kirbykrackle Edmonton Expo, huh?
@RNSrobot @Doctor_Teeth You don't have to do it TOO early. 10 minutes to 6?
@RNSrobot @Doctor_Teeth Not super packed, but busy. Last time, Dev and I sat at the bar.
@RNSrobot @thegibble 3 am. Actually, I'm free after 5:30.
@RNSrobot @thegibble That's next week? Sure. For some reason, I thought it might have been tonight.
@RNSrobot Scona Gold Kolsch? Sure, let's do this. @Doctor_Teeth?
@RNSrobot What's the brew?
@Kevin_Church Shitty teenagers have a lot of disposable money via their parents.
@jayrunham @britl Eat enough bacon, and you'll have plenty of breathless moments.
It was pretty fun to have a nation of gun nuts destroy other civilizations with gunpowder. And then democracy was born. #innovation
Was so hopeful for Pandemic to not explode into flames (it did), played a new game (Keyflower) and then rules the world in Innovation.
Had a fun games afternoon at @nitabing and @scottybomb's. Many games played, and Rule One reared its head once.
@THEKarlaPacheco @theisb I think you just enjoy watching society burn.
@thetrentwilkie Well, they are all pretty tasteful nudes.
@THEKarlaPacheco Please tell me this is all about Anime Destro. At least have a reason for this.
@hopelarson I'm so sorry.
@pau1wa11ace Yay!
@underexperiment Triathlon traffic?
@scottybomb @worstninjaever @nitabing Yes, Scott. My desk is full of dildos.
@nitabing @worstninjaever @scottybomb Well, I found a lot of pens. #brightside
@trishstratuscom Is he one third your height when you're out of heels?
@worstninjaever @scottybomb Yeah, looking for the receipt book. And it was under the coffee table the whole time.
@GOODNESSaidan @theisb You played right into his hands!
@ZoomJer Who's who?
@dublinsomeday Bojack Horseman.
@mattbraga I started hysterically laughing out loud at ep 4.
@1ofakind_Ivy You didn't know? When he went off to do country music, I was all "Huh, the guy from the smalls? Okay."
@scottybomb Yes, I guess that would be the best course of OH GOD WHAT AM I SAYING?
@RNSrobot A Thursday evening? That may work.
Cleaned up my desk and found a bunch of characters I created for different games. Scion, L5R, Fate, Exalted... @scottybomb
And how much do I love @PFTompkins as Mr. Peanutbutter? SO much. Paul's voice works for a happy dog. #peanutbutterisoneword #BojackHorseman
@scottybomb @Ninjastolz Don't get me wrong, it gets pretty dark, but it's not black. Just "wow, these people are messed up."
@Ninjastolz @scottybomb I started to really appreciate it. And was laughing a lot once Ep 4 came about.
@Ninjastolz @scottybomb It takes a few episodes to establish the concept. But once I got to the serialized part (the blackmailers)...
I binge-watched Bojack Horseman on Netflix last night. Give it a few episodes, it becomes hilarious, and then really moving.
@DavidUzumeri And the only one that gets me excited is @zdarsky.
@DavidUzumeri Take a look at the 
@DavidUzumeri Azarello, Pak and Slott would all be people I would love to meet at a western Canadian con.
@DavidUzumeri I dunno. While it's by no means optimal, you've got some guests I could only dream came to Calgary.
@Dalby Oof. There's plenty of other reasons to be mad at a station, but that's not one of them. #whohatescharity
@kalebd Now that's retail I can get behind.
@Dalby what were they mad about?
@DavidUzumeri @BearsActHuman @Zbg333 Thank you for alerting me to this feed.
@WeAreBrewsters Oh wait, 355ml bottles? I'll change my answer to six.
@WeAreBrewsters 5 beers.
@Ninjastolz My dice rolls sucked.

@MichaelSweetser @RNSrobot It's a lot of "THIS NEW GAME IS A SLAP IN MY FACE AND I HATE YOU GUYS!" during development.
@MichaelSweetser @RNSrobot You've never spent time on a game board before the game is released, I assume.
@MichaelSweetser Video gamers.
Dreamed that @apocalypsekow was on the same card as Arcade Fire, Wide Mouth Mason, and a Magnetic Zeroes clone. Was freaking out a lot.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Oh, don't get me wrong, it's very rough. But it's a good start.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Yeah, I saw this last week. Decent voice work. Looking forward to the feature-length version.
@nitabing Oh, you got to the red light a few seconds before me, jerkbag? Good for you.
@sonic1029 Hungry Jack's off Whyte on 104th had the best shawarmas. I miss that place. How about some Small Sins?

@Doctor_Teeth @JenRollinsYEG @ChrissyMcGale And now for a rest.
@Luzzara Thanks, Sarah!
@thefirstjoel @worstninjaever @apocalypsekow If we make it Apocalypse "Bang!" Kow, it could be a tribute to @justicegray.

Looking for a Friday afternoon #yegfringe show? Go see #LigatureMarks! @morgoid is pretty amazing in it!
@apocalypsekow @k_szabsYEG @worstninjaever @izzagud Feh, I was thinking of bringing it up during the Sunday show anyway.
@k_szabsYEG @worstninjaever @izzagud I first learned of our counting error when a friend announced their tenth wedding anniversary.
@apocalypsekow @k_szabsYEG @worstninjaever @izzagud Technically, this is our 13th Fringe. 12th stage show (indoor/outdoor). We busked once.
So @leah_literally and @Randwulven have laced a birthday cake with ebola? Good thing I don't like mocha! #yegprov
@ChefPaulShufelt Next week, I'll get you some Spanish punctuation. We'll talk payment then.
@ChefPaulShufelt Here. Use these. ?.?...
@Leask Fair enough. I've given enough snark for three people.
@Leask Are you saying I'm terminal?
@morgoid I was planning on seeing it tomorrow anyway. Is the 50% at the daily discount booth?

@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Where's the bread maker? And what's a buttfor?
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever Also, not in the money baby or the makermaker.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth Depends on if the answer leads to letting us punch you.
@worstninjaever @Doctor_Teeth We care about your career opportunities. Blows below the neckline only.
@Doctor_Teeth @worstninjaever I WILL PUNCH YOU OUT TO GET YOU TO SLEEP!
