One thing I don't do, is allow others to walk all over me .
I'm the type of person that once I found out that you have/is talking shit about me.. Any real ass friendship I thought we had, is now dead.
But that just comes with maturity ..
Relationships are dumb unless you trying to grow with that person &amp; could potentially see yourself with them in the future .
It's only bc they like the comfort of having someone around . Not because you're the only one they want .
&amp; if someone tells you that they don't want a relationship with you, but always doing relationship things with ....
Isn't **
If you feel like you're the one putting in all the effort, and trying to make shit work.... Then maybe that relationship is t for you . <PERSON WITH POUTING FACE>üèº
I wish all females knew their worth... No matter who you're dating, you deserve to be treated like a Queen <CROWN>

I sometimes reflect on my past &amp; literally can't even believe the shit I use to let fly .

I need someone to let me practice one of these looks on them, before my sisters prom . <TIRED FACE><CHERRY BLOSSOM> 
20 mins late to class <NEUTRAL FACE>
Don't forgot the ones who were there &amp; had your back .
Some people don't realize the things they do are fake as hell .
Oh well, guess it's good I came ..<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Only reason I came to class was because I thought we had a quiz . We ain't got shit . I could've been peacefully sleeping right now <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
Feel like ass . Barely could do my makeup today <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I have when ppls have such unexpected attitudes . <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Good thing her lab got cancelled <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Last night man....<SMIRKING FACE>
Like I said . No one owes ya shit .
I had to learn to set my pride aside, and admit to my wrongs . I know it's hard, but sometimes, you gotta let that shit go .
Yall see how I just turned from hype as fuck and joking, to Sap ? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #crazy
But that's why I love that girl, with everything in me . Bc not only does she accept my at my best, but my worse too . <SLEEPY FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I really don't know how my girlfriend handle my insane, mixed emotional ass . Bc if I was her, I would've been left my crazy ass <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> .
When you're emotional &amp; a psycho wrapped in one &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <SLEEPY FACE>
One minute I'm pushing you telling you I hate you . Next minute I'm apologizing, asking for a kiss . <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
&amp; us females are crazy as fuck in general . We be havin mood swings out the ass ... <TIRED FACE>
If you're super cute, but you talk to like 1million people (even if you not fucking them), that's such a turn off <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Like people think being gay is less problematic than dating a nigga . No bitch, I promise you females are 10x's worse .
Honestly ... A lot of you bitches are ho's <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Smh ... Just sad. I pray you get justice #EricHarris.

Taking the longest shower when I get back to my dorm <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
When my gf goes home she wanna start actin up <FISTED HAND SIGN>üèº<UNAMUSED FACE>
Grades must be on fleek <TIRED FACE>
I feel like I should delete all my social apps and just focus on these last few weeks of school .
Finally on my way back to Gordon . These two days have been crazy as fuck , <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
If you still creepin, bitch you gaf <EYES>
People love to put on a fa√ßade &amp; act like they don't give a fuck about shit . You know you care ... <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
People need to understand .. no one owes you SHIT .
I've been praying a lot lately . Thanking God for all my blessings ....
Why I am yo <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Sometimes I just gotta look at the brighter side of things <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Oh god .... 
I can't wait till this summerrrrrrrrr . Ughhhhhhh , fucking grind time <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I just know at the end of the day whatever i do, it's because of my own happiness . Not anyone else's .
But sometimes I start doubting my capabilities . &amp; that's the fucking worse <CONFOUNDED FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE> .
But I've always been fascinated / interested in the medical field .
If I had guaranteed success , I'd probably be some type of makeup artist <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> .
If you want something, you gotta work for it . Nobody bout to give you shit , believe that .
&amp; That's a no go <RAISED HAND>
If you start relying other ppl, that causes you to be dependent on others .
My parents taught me to rely on yourself, not others .
At the end of the day you should always depend on yourself before anyone else .
Every time I think about that shit my eyes begin to water <CONFOUNDED FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE>
Literally so upset right now <CONFOUNDED FACE>
I should've known today was about to be bad when it took me an hour &amp; a half to do my eyebrows <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Literally about to cry <SLEEPY FACE>

Been up all night helping my girlfriend with her paper <NEUTRAL FACE>.

If you don't get it by now ... Maybe it was never for you to get .
It's the worse when you're trying, but they don't see .... <PENSIVE FACE>
I accept that everyone's not meant to be in your life .
Not everyone's for you .
Many people just don't understand me .
You can't handle me .

I hate to see friends down <PENSIVE FACE>
Been there . Done that . It's shitty, but in the end it'll be sooo relieving and you'll become a new person .
Once you've realize that you deserve better, and there's better out there, you won't worry about that person or care anymore .
Honestly, what helps you get over someone whose done you wrong, &amp; you're still in love with them.. Is to dig into your inner self love .
( for you nosey fuckers these tweets aren't directly about me, just general ) .
It's so hard to let go of something . Especially when at one point of your life it seemed like that person meant everything to you .
Love yourself . Because no one will go as hard for you, as you will .
Happiness comes from within . You can't try to seek happiness from other people when you're not truly happy with yourself .
You got to do what's best FOR you . It'll be hard , but when you overcome whatever is holding you back, you'll feel amazing in the end <FACE THROWING A KISS> .
Anyone want to go to the cafe with me ?
Woke up listening to Sam smith, already in my feelings . <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>

We talk every now &amp; then, but you really don't know the person I am now or what's been going on in my life .
Those friendships were you keep in touch are cool, but honestly you lose the real friendship you have with them .
Time changes everything <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>

When you find yourself loving someone bc of how it USED to be, but hate how it is now... Time to go mf .

We all get warned of the shitty ass people out there . But it doesn't really hit us until someone shitty enters your life <PERSON WITH POUTING FACE>.
But . Sometimes it takes yourself being in a shitty situation to learn from it .
When someone genuinely care, they'll show it . People aren't perfect , they fuck up . But it's a problem when it's a reoccurring thing .
They * my b .
Sometimes you think " oh, they're sorry. they won't do it again " but if it's a continuous thing... They're not sorry. They're just dgaf .
I'm not saying you should never trust anyone . Because then you could miss out on so much . But,  be cautious with who you trust <THOUGHT BALLOON>

Let me bool out .
The law is fr fr bullshit.
But homosexuals can't get married privately &amp; legally in some states???
We're supposedly are allowed to have "rights to privacy", which we don't even have bc the gov spies on us......
What fucking sense does that make?
YET, marriage... Which is technically a service given to us, can't be allowed when it's used in a homosexual relationship .
Supposedly the law says that everyone has equal protection laws meaning that laws or carried out equally &amp; everyone gets the same services.
