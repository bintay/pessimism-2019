Oh...and what are you cooking with your funky orange root?!
@CBarronie 

Ha!

Separate question...the photo says Ardingly...is that where you're from?
@CBarronie 

Turmeric?

Needless to say, I had the last laugh...

You've got to chill out, yeah, trust me, this is what I do, alright? You will never work in a place like this again. 

Fact
@Vitu_E On a more positive note, the good news is, I've been promoted. So, every cloud…you're still thinking about the bad news, aren't you?

@IHPower @Puncroaker 

Well that just sounds sour grapes to me...
@Midgetgems26 @Jo_Forty 

Not bluffing exactly...but knowing other people don't have a clear idea either helps me feel more confident!
@BertSwattermain @Midgetgems26 

He's fantastic; and he's got a variety of different colours of gloves and coats; marvellous!
@Midgetgems26 

The higher you go up in business, the more you realise everyone is actually just winging it!

Funnily enough, this is the only place I talk politics! And only recently.

I've spent the weekend being serious on here! Talking to irate people on why I feel UKIP views demean us all...

I wasn't trying to do that !

Just a puerile sense of humour... You say Dick ; I hear Van Dyke!

Yep. I then gave myself a very hard time for never having joined before!

@ScottHoad 

Well dash my wig, young fustilugs!
@Midgetgems26 

I just don't get it.

But I'd never unfollow someone who expressed the opposing view?

Although if they criticised Porridge…
@ScottHoad 

Feels like a Hopkins-esque kind of insult...

The election was actually respectfully scheduled for May 14th to allow proper space for VE Day celebrations.

Wasn't it...?
@Midgetgems26 

yet I don't get him in the context of House of Fools?!

I think it's too absurd.

Same for some of Young Ones (heresy...)
@Midgetgems26 

I've never really got Vic &amp; Bob. 

But I love Toast...
@Midgetgems26 

Not for you then?!

Not pant-wettingly funny I grant you...but tickles me more than House of Fools for example!?
@Midgetgems26 @ItsAndyRyan 

I think it's benefited from a very low key launch...
@Midgetgems26 

Well don't you start getting all judgemental!

I actually quite like some of Miranda; mainly the falls.
@Midgetgems26 

Yes!

He brought a bit of Inside No 9 physicality and shock into it which was a great twist!

Well I find this offensive.

Not sure where this leaves us...
@AndyGilder @georgegalloway 

Fairly safe ground legally I'd have thought; this information is already widely available in the public domain
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

And? He was wrong on many issues!

My point isn't that EU is perfect; more that UKIP alternative isn't credible
@TreacleToo @Puncroaker 

I think King Alfred thought up the "in Dorset" joke when he was burning his cakes...

But it may well be older!
@TreacleToo @Puncroaker 

Outstanding.  The "in Dorset" gag deserves national treasure status...

My wife's gone to Monkey World.

Yes, she said it was really good.

@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

But proposals should have a firm base...not massively tenuous assumptions on free trade deals with superpowers?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Have you read the assessment?

Major caveat that financial impact of leaving EU couldn't be estimated...
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Really? You'd abandon the EU and jump in with Russia?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_

The BBC have done Nigel far more favours with coverage and airtime than he merits in reality!
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_

We're unlikely to agree I think !

My point is that UKIP manifesto and proposals aren't practical in any area
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_

If you're asking the more reliable source of the BBC vs UKIP then I'd go for the former...
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Will look in detail...but one key point is securing free trade with China and Russia. 

Is that likely?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ @BBCNews 

Yep; it's out in the public domain.

What's your point?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

If they're genuine, reliable sources, then I'd be happy to read them?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 





Evidence is there if you want it...
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

stopping EU migration would cost public services more in lost tax revenue than it would save in reduced demand
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Immigration helps build the economy; not drag it back?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Why not change and improve the infrastructure rather than shut the doors?
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Immigrants are not stealing British people's jobs…there's no evidence that this happens to any significant level
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

But beyond immigration, UKIP proposals are unworkable and confused.

Pensions, everything EU, Human Rights...
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

Great - research shows migration has a far bigger upside than down economically and socially
@IHPower 

But more importantly, you've let yourself down.

For shame .
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

It's an example of a very small correction in The Sun following a major headline lie.

And people believe lies
@IHPower 

chickens don't cross roads.

And even if they did, why would they need a reason?

And horses can't fit into bars.
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

That's not only incorrect but also shows you've been fed the lines about immigration being the answer. It's not
@sam_bambs 

Then your neck, then your neck, then your neeeeck...
@sam_bambs 

Then your kidneys will be next...
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

The problems are real; the solutions &amp; proposals are unworkable, based on myths to make people feel better
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_ 

The ideas are outdated and irrelevant, feeding simplistic and deceitful answers to people who deserve better
@realdealdanny @Jonnywol_

Labour will be around long after UKIP have been consigned to an interesting phenomenon in history...

Not Mark Almond either.

I was discussing the Human Rights Act with a few Ukippers yesterday on here

Magna Carta &amp; common sense was the proposal...
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

They've been utterly duped by simple answers...very sad in many ways.
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

I spent a little while talking to Ukippers on here yesterday. 

It was actually very enlightening
@Midgetgems26 

Paddington has to be the pick...
@AndyGilder @ItsAndyRyan 

Absolutely! 

And in doing this, I think he helped!

No way of proving either way though.
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

I might be overthinking it!

But an end to Nigel and a figurehead for UKIP is hugely beneficial for the country?
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

It was a straight fight between Tory &amp; UKIP; lesser of 2 evils was enduring Nigel didn't get further legitimised?
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

No, no...I don't think he's pro Tory necessarily!

The idea was to parody UKIP views so Nigel didn't get in?
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

His aim wasn't ever to garner votes for himself though?
@ItsAndyRyan @AndyGilder 

I think his aim was to show how ridiculous Nigel and his policies were...pushing potential voters to the Tories?
@AndyGilder 

I think Al Murray deserves a bit of credit for helping to block him

Nigel at Westminster would have been hugely galvanising

So do you buy leather trousers, a red sports car and hang around strip clubs ?

Or do women do these things differently ?

No need to shout!

@vivienmiss @Thegent77_ @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

They're genuine questions.

My point is: UKIP has no workable plans
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

How do you know this? Because someone has given you easy answers...
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt

Whose common sense?

"Right thinking people"?
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Magna Carta covered a fraction of the population...wasn't universal
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 
My point is that scrapping the HRA won't achieve what you think it does
@vivienmiss @Thegent77_ @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

Me too. Before the HRA we had The European Convention on Human Rights
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Really…you'd be happy with the human rights granted by Magna Carta?
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Does that mean it doesn't happen?
@vivienmiss @Thegent77_ @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 
True: The European Convention on Human Rights which we ratified in 1953
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Right to a fair trial. Right to free assembly.

What should we drop?
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

The right not to be tortured or enslaved. Freedom of expression?
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

So what replaces the Human Rights Act?

What's the alternative?
@PaulAddick @vivienmiss @Thegent77_ @raf633 @almurray 

Come on children, I thought we were having a civilized exchange of views?
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Far more to lose than gain by repealing the Human Rights Act
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

I'm fairly sure you've neither read nor analysed the manifesto.
@Thegent77_ @PaulAddick @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray 

Happy to keep to to analysis of ideas; UKIP on shaky ground there.
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius 

#numbnutsknows would be a great hashtag for  @jongaunt if he's still reading?
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Have you read it?

Pensions proposals? Pulling out of EU Human Rights?
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 


@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

The majority of the manifesto is unworkable and contradictory.
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

Discrimination would be, yes...but not under UKIP proposals.
@vivienmiss @Thegent77_ @PaulAddick @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

to be clear; I'm calling the ideas ludicrous: not people.
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Sorry!

Which questions?

Happy to analyse the UKIP manifesto &amp; ideas?
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

and your point on restrictive sanctions is entirely false…
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 
UKIP manifesto wants to keep the good bits but not be part of EU: silly
@Thegent77_ @lovejoy92 @vivienmiss @NotForThe_Weak @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

We're talking about Nigel vs Al though
@vivienmiss @Thegent77_ @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

Ukip's figurehead will not be in in Parliament…all else is irrelevant
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Leaving the EU but retaining trade &amp; healthcare and intelligence
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Fair enough

I choose to disagree and believe Al did the UK a favour.
@Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

But Al's main aim was to stop UKIP leader becoming an MP

And he did.
@Thegent77_ @lovejoy92 @vivienmiss @NotForThe_Weak @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

Any idea can be satirized…some make it easy
@vivienmiss @NotForThe_Weak @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

The act had an impact on how people voted...
@PaulAddick @Thegent77_ @vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @jongaunt 

No comment on the people.

But the ideas are racist.
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

He showed people UKIP ideas are ludicrous: so they voted Tory instead
@vivienmiss @NotForThe_Weak @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 
And the act stopped the UKIP leader getting in: success
@vivienmiss @raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

His aim was to block Nigel becoming MP, not win himself?!

job done!
@Cain_Unable

Great achievement
@raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 
For me, his act opened eyes to how ridiculous UKIP ideas are: success=Nigel not MP
@Cain_Unable 

The fox stuff was just  very clear and early show of strength...lazy flexing.

Worrying...
@AchillesTatius @raf633 @almurray @Thegent77_ @jongaunt

But what was he trying to achieve by standing?

Be careful...seems a little rash to me...
@raf633 @almurray @AchillesTatius @Thegent77_ @jongaunt 

Help me out...what was the mistake he made in standing?

What were his aims?
@Thegent77_ @jongaunt @almurray 

Which part backfired?

When Nigel was elected?
@dysondoc @AndyGilder @mafnorton @darceygrowsup @craiguito @Puncroaker

What could possibly go wrong...
@obsoletetruth 

and BBC left wing bias is massively overstated (by right wing media mainly).

People hear what fits their viewpoint.
@obsoletetruth 

License fee is £12 a month...if that doesn't represent good value for money then I can't think of anything that does!
@obsoletetruth 

And the BBC is funded by a hugely broad base...and so creates content accordingly.

Some of which you'll hate. Rightly so.
@obsoletetruth

But I don't like those shows.

Does that mean HBO have a poor strategy ?

@poisonousdarce @alexshawsport 
I can see how it happened if that was the planned theme…just a bit baffled as to why that theme was chosen?
@alexshawsport 

US-style team branding seems to have led to basketball-style scoring....points one end...then the other!
@alexshawsport @poisonousdarce 

I'm also not sure it's inevitable. Wasps have nothing to do with Cowboys…it's a shoddy bit of marketing.

I'm actually not even watching it! Just assumed that was the reference…

@bails64 @alexshawsport 

Sky and BT hype the games...that's their job?

But home sides rarely lose QFs...esp Clermont?
@bails64 Saints blown away by a pumped Clermont. And Bath in disciplined, but not poor?

Home advantage massively important in Europe.

Watched latest ep for first time last night...then again, 3 times in a row...beautiful, innovative and inspiring!

Stunning.

I watched the latest episode for the 1st time last night; then 3 times again in a row...

I was actually quite disappointed I missed our local UKIP candidate...I had visions of haranguing him down the street..,

Absolutely. Normal reaction would have been to dump her in a trolley and push her down the hill.

Admirable restraint shown.

Thought I must have missed a column. Would love to see Saints do it, but Clermont at home are very tough...

I've probably missed your predictions; 

Leinster, Saracens, Clermont, Toulon?

I did think yellow before. But watching again, it's reckless: if a ban helps prevent a repeat then maybe it's justified?
@Puncroaker 

when does middle age start....

No ban at all for you? Red card more than ample?

@AndyGoode10 

Press release says Martyn Wood was on panel? Ex Bath &amp; Wasps scrum half or different person maybe?
@GD10 @simonrug 
It was still reckless, regardless of intent or outcome. 
For what it's worth, I'd also sanction dangerous near misses.
@nick__moore 

It's an interesting one, definitely. Clearly no intent...but rugby needs to do more to prevent a repeat. Ban might help?
@dandavies77 @simonrug 

How do you judge who plays and who watches from Twitter?

And lack of intent doesn't mean no wrongdoing?
@KCrowley99 @GTRees1992 @simonrug 

Players need to avoid putting themselves in these positions. Bar has to be set higher to prevent injury.
@GD10 @simonrug 
Really? That's where we should set the bar? Loss of consciousness?
Rugby is not a better game for this kind of recklessness
@nick__moore

Fair enough. Your comment sounded like Saints had something to gain by a long ban.
@GD10 @simonrug 

Not 3 matches necessarily.

But the game overall would benefit from stronger punishment for dangerous play
@simonrug 
"Accidental" or "not that kind if player" are utterly irrelevant.
If the ban discourages similar head injuries, it's justified.
@nick__moore @AndyGoode10 @matt9dawson 

How would Saints benefit from a ban?
@alexshawsport 

Too lenient by half eh?

A travesty....
@JemRoberts 

There were 40 episodes of Brush Strokes.

I will never stop finding this amazing...

Don't remember the Brazil 1970 team needing a donkey in the middle to kick into the stands....
@AndyGilder 

Same with most sports....cricket, rugby...

We prefer hardworking "honest" solid grafters who won't let you down...
@FoyChris @WaspsRugby 

As will North at Clermont for @SaintsRugby.

If the ban makes other players more careful, 3 weeks seems fair.
@AndyGilder 

Brown people.

The answer is always brown people.
