@DaAnsahonSports @BrittMcHenry brainz
@DaAnsahonSports and @BrittMcHenry is still employed. Justice.
@pattonoswalt nailed it
@ESPNNBA @LAClippers @HoustonRockets clippers please!
@BrittMcHenry wow, insightful analysis. I guess there's only so much college learnings can do for you...
@mashable @KimKardashian get off her dick
@jacksfilms I said yes but only if they don't interfere.
@hankgreen your snaps are cracking me up.
@jeffgoldesq @thegoldpatrol too bad there weren't screw driver wielding skateboarders running around that day.

@hollybdc I think the "why" is being answered by them by outlining who Tamerlan was and the hold he has on DT. IMO.
@ChrisPV66 @extrainnings77 @cnni @PamelaGeller I'm just saying it is an opinion piece. Not straight news. You should expect a slant
@zefalafez @AC360 ok...what?
@zefalafez @AC360 I'm not taking a stand here or defending island. You misspelled Muslim. And it was funny.
@extrainnings77 @ChrisPV66 @cnni @PamelaGeller it's an op-ed. It's an opinion piece.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit lol...they're coming for your guns too, you know.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit awww <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit peace.
@FredHorne5 @Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit when you can't handle adverse opinions. Mature.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit well, what can you do about it? Night.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit not everyone can handle the freedoms given without limiting them.You're a nice idealist but not realistic.
@FredHorne5 @Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit bye!!!
@FredHorne5 @Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit ALL religion is stupid.
@FredHorne5 @Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit mistake me.
@FredHorne5 @Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit of course it is!!!! Certain members of Islam are no better. I'm not defending Islam, do not
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit lmao. What planet do you live on?
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit about.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit keep posting it, it doesn't change the meaning. Free speech without purpose is what I'm talking
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit there is.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit next guy to express my opinion.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit I won't disagree with this. Case in point. And I have just as much free speech rights as the
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit handles their freedom with responsibility.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit lol. A right doesn't. What's done with it does. It's why we have laws. Because not everyone
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit dude I have been thinking the same thing about you. My god, how can anyone be this slow?
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit a simile but.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit you don't understand its place in the sentence. It has no PURPOSE. It's not a stifling but, but
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit you seriously think everything everyone says has a purpose and a point???
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I think it does.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit I was saying one thing is free speech and one thing is stupid free speech.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit sometimes it's just a word in a sentence. I wasn't saying free speech BUT limited
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit because it was. It always was and you know it. You're attaching the BUT to something I wasn't.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit we could go on forever. I see the problem. You see it as Black and white and I see the gray areas.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes I did. Two camps. No mistaking it.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit no it's not. It's a label that doesn't silence but is accurate none the less.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit I have BEEN clarifying it!
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit no I am not. I have been sayin the samething the whole time u are just seriously not getting it
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit but it was an opinion. How are you missing that? Is it a demonstrable fact? No, then it is an opinion
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes there is though.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit hate speech is real.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit lol stop repeating it if you aren't going to understand it.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit yeah it did. You just missed it.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit surely you don't think all ideas are good ones or deserve defending.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit I didn't say free speech BUT. I was talking about two different kinds of motivations.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I didn't say BUT.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit now we are cooking with gas.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit no I didn't. Your first sentence is what I did. I called it antagonistic. No buts about it.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit i didn't though.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit because I am.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit sure I can.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit but responded to in the manner it deserves.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit of course. I'm not saying if it has no purpose it should be stifled.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I know it doesn't. But most people DO and respond to it.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit there's good and bad to everything.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit never said there was.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit you can hear my fingers snapping?
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit yes it is!!!!
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit it doesn't though. Just another opinion of many.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit um, no you aren't. Just healthy debate. Al sharpton is still around isn't he?
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit because there is good and bad. Can you say it? Yes. How are you missing this.
@zefalafez @AC360 those evil MUSIMS
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes and I stand by it. I am still saying the same thing.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit deaf? We are on the Internet.
@Gluesponge @FredHorne5 @cnnbrk @instapundit anything that it isn't rooted in fact is an opinion. Did you need that spelled out? No.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit is still free speech. I am not saying it should be stopped or limited. I'm calling it what it is.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit that isn't what I said though. That's where you're getting lost. Free speech without a cause or point is
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit all speech is free. That is still not the point. My point stands, thanks!
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit it was!!!! That is my point!!!!
@FredHorne5 @Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes. But I am talking deliberate.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit and if you need someone to blatantly specify when they are expressing an opinion, then that explains a lot
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit it? DUH. Does that make it right? No.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I am saying they were to incite anger in people and drum up the exact response she got. Was she free to do
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I am saying that her motives behind the event are not pure nor were they about an exercise of rights.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit drop the free speech thing for a second because I think we can all agree that it's a thing.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit dude you can't even follow a simple point. *snap snap* I'm over here.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit my point was invalid? Are you attaching value to my free speech? You can't do that!
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit no I didn't. Pay attention.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit is full of it.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes free speech allows her to say and do these things. And I am using my free speech to tell her I think
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit and you went off on a whole thing about free speech.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit no I am not. That is your misguided straw man. My main point was the event was antagonistic
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit  but to be more discerning.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I am not limiting it. My god damn. I am saying we have a responsibility. Not to not offend
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I never said it wasn't my opinion though.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit sure you can. It's all relevant. We can defend someone's right to free speech and still call them wrong
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes for the purpose of criticism. Not for the purpose of silence. Free speech comes with responsibility
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit and I can call you on it.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes. Checked. The beautiful thing about free speech is that it is free to everyone. You can spout your hate
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit OY. I'm not saying it shouldn't be said. But I am questioning the motives behind it.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit now the bitch is on CNN spouting her anti-Islam spiel. Worked like a charm.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit yes. This is my opinion. My opinion is that the event was antagonistic and accomplished what they wanted
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I didn't say that you are still totally missing my point.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit it's the same idea behind criticizing the KKK. Sure they can say it, but should it go unchecked? NO
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit no I'm not. I'm saying maybe exercise better judgment and criticize those who come from a place of hate
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit one is valuable one is pointless. This was quite pointless.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit two separate things.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit I am not questioning their right to say what they say or do what they do. I am questioning their motives
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit and I am saying it does matter.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit satire and ridicule are not the same thing
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit satire is one thing and I'm a fan. There was no point to this exhibit though other than pure ridicule.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit Still missing my point.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit huh?
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit it's ok to support their right to free speech while acknowledging the misguided ness of the event
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit you are missing MY point.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit this was not satire. It was ridicule. It was a dare. Hosted by a hateful organization.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit your message across.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit to exercise freedom it was to whip people up and then cry about the zealots. There are other ways of gettin
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit what I am saying is there was no purpose other than to piss people off. Their purpose was not
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit sure they do and I'm not defending the zealots. But there's two sides here. They can do what they want but
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit it doesn't matter. Free speech is free speech. Doesn't NOT make it boneheaded and antagonistic and hateful.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit they wanted it because it helps them drive forward  their narrative. Mission accomplished I guess.
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit free speech is one thing but free speech without purpose is another. Their only reason for it was to incite
@Gluesponge @cnnbrk @instapundit it speaks more to the antagonistic nature of the exhibit. They not only expected it they wanted it.
@HeyUSA @Jenna_Marbles k found it lol
@HeyUSA @crystalhsueh @Jenna_Marbles is this one out yet, I can't find it?

WATCH: 
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat when discrimination affects your way of life and happiness, it's everyone's problem, not just yours.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat here's the thing:
Some people actually ARE singled out because of color.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat unwarranted cried of racism happen. But it doesn't mean racism is totally dead.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat yeah World War II is over. American racism is not over. It's not black and white so to speak. Heh.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat because you're not experiencing oppression from them. It's not the same.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat hopefully in June the SC ends the fight and makes it federal law.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat in a select few states. In the others they are still fighting.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat ause of it.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat slavery argument you hate so much? My ancestors were holocaust survivors too but I'd never claim to know racism bec
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat oh wow..."we?" you know racism because your ancestors survived the Holocaust? How is that any different than the
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat another example of "this is a fake problem" when it isn't.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat we are not even close. LGBT can't even marry in this country and can be denied service in some states.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat all of them?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat yes. White people who can't see blacks and minorities as equals and can't move past the racism of their ancestors
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat teaching it to each other.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat wow right again. Old racists pass down their hatred to their kids and grandkids. It won't die because they keep
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat realize he wasn't welcome in a white area.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat it happened to a Christian recording artist when he went to Tennessee. The only thing he'd done wrong was not
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat what question?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat existence of race baiting and race card drawing.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat it doesn't have to be either or. One can acknowledge the existence of racism without dismissing the
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat racism is absolutely a mindset, based on fears, stereotypes, unfounded generalizations...
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat think that shit only happens in the 50s?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat to be treated fairly. Have you ever walked into a restaurant and told to leave because you're white?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat and I wonder about a country where it's worse to call someone a racist than it actually is to be racist.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat racism exists though. It's not always a scapegoat. It's a real thing.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat again, they are not freely given. They are still earned.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat you money.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat again, being minority is not the only requirement. You have to work hard and make good grades. They don't just hand
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat scholarships are freebies?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat work just as hard.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat great work ethic. What's amazing is you don't think any of the black people getting jobs and scholarships
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ exactly.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ police brutality happens to all races.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat that's great. And if you made good grades maybe you'd have gotten a scholarship. From one you could get, of course
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat that is not even something that's based in fact.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat not true AT ALL
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ and again, whites can get every other scholarship.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ not what I'm saying. It's to encourage minorities to get an education and increase numbers.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ baiting*
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ not saying race bating doesn't happen. Oh, it does. But not always And the Old negro scholarship arguments is flimsy
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat it's not. It's a scholarship geared toward minorities to encourage them. You didn't get it and you made it by.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat they don't just hand out money to black people either. They have to make good grades and do all the work too.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ 
@Jillian_Sara_ lol so you hate minority's and stay at home mothers? Incredible! What a multi trick pony you are.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ argument you've been peddling for years to prove reverse racism? Cause it's flimsy.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ right. But does it really bother you that much that ONE scholarship is not for you? Or is this just the bullshit
@Jillian_Sara_ you think just because I feel the way I do I must be some low income social mooch?
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ but there's one you can't get your hands on and it's a social travesty?
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ how does this oppress you? There's thousands of other scholarships you could qualify for?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat why would you apply for a negro fund?
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ go ahead. He works in the oil and has industry.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat well, guess what, I pay taxes too! And pay for my own health insistence and everything. Are you shocked?
@Jillian_Sara_ my husband also makes six figures so you aren't supporting me, thanks.
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ oh my God, call the justice department, they've got their own channel!
@Jillian_Sara_ and yet most can figure out how to write coherently. You can't even spell. It's descent, not "decent."
@Jillian_Sara_ yes, trivial indeed.
@Jillian_Sara_  maybe that's why you're not getting the jobs, buddy. Your schooling has failed you.
@Jillian_Sara_ and let me tell you, all that college and book learnin' and you can barely formulate a coherent sentence.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat you're the entitled one it seems.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat and if they did their time and their internships and whatnot you should still get the job anyway?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat yeah I didn't say that. Learn to read man.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat all because he's black.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat lol then that proves it. He's also dealt with claims of being a Muslim and a foreigner and a socialist
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat talk about expecting things. I'm a smart white girl give me the job!
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat no of course not, because they're black and dumb. So they must have got the Job because of AA
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat did it ever occur to you that the Black person, if this is even happening, is more qualified than you?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat which blacks? Are the Blacks calling you on the phone to tell you they got the job and gloat?
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat honey I'm looking at it. And no, it's not because I think you owned slaves.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat lol racism doesn't exist?????
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat not because they think you owned fucking slaves. Get real.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat people have chips on their shoulders bcuz they feel the oppression that comes with being a minority every damn day
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat don't stand a chance.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat I have lived in white neighborhoods and I have lived in black neighborhoods. The low income black neighborhoods
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat everyone has some sad sack story, even you. But your tales of white woe are bull shit.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat here's the thing. You can acknowledge that racism exists without moving so far in the other direction.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat I'm sure the person of colored "decent" made more than you. Sure...
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat you basically have to be making nothing.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat guess what? That happens to everyone not just the poor oppressed whites. It's hard to get financial aid for everyone
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat it is what it is what is is it?
@doxucat @Jillian_Sara_ lol god you're right. White people are so oppressed.
@ShannonSanford9 @Murph7071 @lingling23  oh Fox News. Then it must be true.
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat low income shit housing. Yeah <OK HAND SIGN>
@Jillian_Sara_ @doxucat food stamps and welfare is available to everyone who qualifies. Mostly whites and blacks on it.
@reasonable_ish @robvfour @FOP3 that's what I said. I meant due process has nothing to do with GFM's perfectly sound rule.
@jwvansteenwyk @TheTGM @fearwig @FOP3 anything else should be paid back to state and family if they're found guilty.
@jwvansteenwyk @TheTGM @fearwig @FOP3 um, no. They will get an attorney for free if they're broke.
@robvfour @reasonable_ish @FOP3 that has nothing to do with GFM's rules. You can't raise money for those charged with crimes.
@DNchef @MobileCoffeeApp @Foxmcloud555 felony? He wasn't even breaking the law. They had no reason to arrest him.
@RandyDParas @AC360 @donlemon hopefully
@RandyDParas @AC360 @donlemon he says that's what he though but didn't know. He couldn't even see him.
@RandyDParas @AC360 @donlemon saying u think it sounds like someones hurting self is hardly the evid. the anti-Gray people are touting it as
@RandyDParas @AC360 @donlemon I was surprised too because it's obvious the WP flat out misquoted him and pushed a narrative that wasn't true
@RandyDParas @AC360 @donlemon He had no idea and denies ever saying #FreddieGray was trying to hurt self
@RandyDParas @AC360 @donlemon listen 2whole interview He said that's what he THOUGHT

@Teri423 @FOP3 @KelseyAnneHagen good. ItsGFM policy u cant raise money if youve been charged w/crime n want to use the money to pay legal
@foxandfriends lol really? THIS is what you get all angry and indignant about?
<LARGE RED CIRCLE> LIVE @jacksfilms on #YouNow - 
@washingtonpost retract your blatantly false story on #FreddieGray
@washingtonpost you should include your article on the prisoner that said gray injured himself. He said himself that he never said that.
@Teri423 @KFaulders I'm reading both. I read there wouldn't be but on CNN they said there would be. IDK!
@Teri423 @KFaulders I read there wouldn't be one?
The prisoner who everyone has been saying heard #FreddieGray trying to hurt himself just told @CNN that is "absolutely untrue."
#FreddieGray #BaltimoreRiots 

The pretzel hold the placed him sounded unlawful too. He was sitting and already cuffed. There was no reason to do that. #FreddieGray
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper they should be.
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper absolutely I am. This is a very tragic thing and if there are people who should be held accountable
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper that is also a rush to judgment.
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper you also said I can believe the crap Moby is saying but you won't. You have no evidence she is lying
@kenneybaden I'm happy with charges but not optimistic.
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper stop?
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper largely on what the officers told her happened. And if they were in the right why lie about the other
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper there's more evidence the charges are appropriate to bring than not. Seems Mosby's case was made...
@twizzy7 @itsericayo @andersoncooper you certainly have made a rush to judgment. Wrongful charges to quiet protests?
@SunnyHostin what do you think the second degree charge means? That they intentionally shackled him and rough rided him? Thank you!
@twizzy7 @MudPuppetRyan @andersoncooper yes he could be wrong. But it's still appropriate to bring charges based on his findings.
@twizzy7 @MudPuppetRyan @andersoncooper she's not going In blind.The ME called it homicide So charges are justified Officers are responsible
@twizzy7 @MudPuppetRyan @andersoncooper no I'm saying based on what the DA said it was appropriate to bring charges.
@twizzy7 @MudPuppetRyan @andersoncooper That implies you feel the charges are being wrongfully made before you've heard all evid. Assumption
@MudPuppetRyan @twizzy7 @andersoncooper right!Charges seem appropriate based on DA's revelations. Doesn't mean guilty but charges were right
@twizzy7 @MudPuppetRyan @andersoncooper but you've already decided the officers are innocent and being railroaded by criminals. #hypocrisy
The second degree charge implies they think it was a rough ride. Threw him in back and slammed him around. #FreddieGray #Baltimore
@twizzy7 @andersoncooper no but Mosby is and she said he was wrongfully detained. Again, you have to listen. They had no reason to arrest
@twizzy7 @andersoncooper it's obvious. If you listened to her she laid out a very good case against them. The didn't help him.
@twizzy7 @andersoncooper after wrongfully detaining him, of course.
@twizzy7 @andersoncooper and negligence. Sounds like #FreddieGray was the 1 was railroaded after told them he need help and they ignored him
@twizzy7 @andersoncooper it was made bcuz it was the right thing 2 do after invest. and medical examination revealed it was a homicide.
@DaeguDave @andersoncooper yes I've read this. He did not resist and they arrested him without any cause.
@twizzy7 @andersoncooper railroaded how?
@MarilynMosbyEsq that was beautiful and hoping justice is served. Thanks for your hard work.
Manner of death: HOMICIDE charges: second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, assault and other negligence charges. #FreddieGray
@jacksfilms @thefinebros that's where I first saw you. It was all downhill from there.

@Livin_dreamlife who are they? Thanks.
@dallasnews and this is who is running Texas...
@Kalikrome possibly. I need to hear what the doctors have to say first.
@Kalikrome yes he deserves punishment. But that punishment should not be the death penalty. He is sick even if he knew what he was doing.
@BeckyBadger1 @BostonBorn66 @alexson0518 exactly NE 1 stop to think he chose violence bcuz hes seen it all his life from his abusive mother?
@Kalikrome simply put, yes. His mind doesn't work right and I think that's fairly obvious. He needs help not death.
@TrialDiariesJ so it was probably the pregnant woman holding things up. They get an alternate in and BOOM.

@HappyLeeanne @katiecoolady @azcentral Tanisha said they were threatened for that day.
@ImTanyaWilliams @kenneybaden whether or not the defense did an aggressive enough job, the evidence against him was strong enough.
@ImTanyaWilliams @kenneybaden that's obviously not what convicted him though. They didn't even speculate what was in the black bag.
@kenneybaden @ImTanyaWilliams differently how? I thought the defense did a great job. But the mountains of circ evidence was too high
@TrialDiariesJ I don't see why they couldn't reveal what went on in the jury room.
@BrandonSpikes51 I know it's weird. If you kill people you go away for life. How terrible...
@SportsCenter good job throwing your life away hope it was worth it.
@PMONEY1488 @Patrick29625736 @SportsCenter you think he shot himself multiple times in the chest and back?

VIDEO: 
#AaronHernandez
@troyhaydenfox10 I've come to the realization while following this trial there are few true journalists left. You're one of them tho. Thanks
@CourtPencil @KillersLie is it really an "exclusive" when he and Willmott talk all the time?

@TrialDiariesJ *bangs head*
@15ArsonKrazy @troyhaydenfox10 I believe you owe someone some money <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@TrialDiariesJ @juanstie2 @GarrisonBlue @wing_laurie ok I thought you weren't married lol
@Patynando it was a baby of a friend of the Alexanders and they were in the victim room.
@justdatruth2012 God. Miserably.
@TrialDiariesJ shocking
#jodiarias
@ZoeyWatson2014 she really did.
@TrialDiariesJ hung jury
@jacksfilms you did it again Jack. 2 pm PT, 5 pm ET.
@rhettandlink #willithotpocket pork rinds!
@BigD6foot6 @SunnyHostin right. But it just highlights the cold, calculated nature of it. He knew exactly and what to do and say to dispatch
@BigD6foot6 @SunnyHostin especially because of how slow he was running. To calmly shoot someone like and plant evid that is cold blooded.
@SunnyHostin @BigD6foot6 that video sickens me. And even then skeptical that he will get the punishment he deserves.
@jeffgoldesq it was very circumstantial and the defense did a good job but yes I think they did.
@TrialDiariesJ you too Jen!
@TrialDiariesJ omg Happy Days flashback.
@bobloblaw1717 @NolteNC IRS scandal also found to be non scandal. No wrong doing.
@bobloblaw1717 @NolteNC there was nothing to uncover, again, after covering it as nauseum. 
@bobloblaw1717 @NolteNC no. I meant covered. As in the media has covered these things.
@NolteNC @bobloblaw1717 they've covered all these ad nauseum save the Irs thing because it was a non existent scandal.
@JulienSolomita I did you never opened it.
@JodiAriasNeedle @Rparisee only thing evidence shows was she lived in the house and her DNA was there. Naturally.
@Rparisee @JodiAriasNeedle I've gone over evidence many times There is no solid evidence she or sollecito took any part. Right man in jail.
@TroyPittman1 @my_shnanigans @eatsyoursoul it's terrible. MK's family should be more outraged at that than anything else.
@davidamelej @nytimes also just read he'd been recently dumped by girlfriend.
@davidamelej @nytimes in the article they also said he sought treatment for psychological problems.
@HeaIthDaily scam. Google p90x results and you'll see this picture and see it for other programs. Who even knows what she really did.
@HeaIthDaily @FitGirINow this is bull u see this pic everywhere used for before n afters I've been seeing this pic for months now not for GC
@LEX18News @TrialDiariesJ thank god
@jeffgoldesq too far! It's weird!
@jeffgoldesq @thegoldpatrol hell no. She gonna lie.
@jeffgoldesq makes no sense. The baby was 7 months. Could have survive outside womb.
@jacksfilms strike that. Reverse it.
@PapiDimmi @jacksfilms how dare you.
@jacksfilms gamergod
@bychristinebswk what did he do?
@POLSPhoenix @azcentral monitoring jurors' FBs too and that they had also been logging in. She's a hypocrite. This is just manufactured
@POLSPhoenix @azcentral not only did JW not seem to have a problem when juan revealed he'd been digging on FB she revealed they'd been cont
@azcentral her husband outed her on Facebook when he started asking for $ after HJ. Other 11 had all info posted on JAII and still there.
Check it out please she really needs it.  
@RodneyGodstick @TransAmnesia ok whew. Haha. It was quite poor sentence structure on my part. Small world lol.
@TransAmnesia @RodneyGodstick maybe he thought I was saying my husband was a psychopath and he does it a lot? I meant Durst though.
@TransAmnesia @RodneyGodstick so weird. I literally just posted this last night. I assure you my safety is nothing to be feared.
@TransAmnesia @RodneyGodstick lol what the hell?
@NBA_AU yep.
@MarkAWebster1 bizzle.
@MarkAWebster1 no use in alienating them.
@MarkAWebster1 the younger Iranians are trending more liberal minded and open to new ways. They may change the future of Iran.
@MarkAWebster1 so I don't get the argument against at least trying.
@MarkAWebster1 the deal may not work. But it might. They would be forced to submit to inspections.
@MarkAWebster1 that wasn't a sarcastic right.
@MarkAWebster1 the deal would prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Or it's attempt to. It's not jodi Obama that wants it either.
@MarkAWebster1 RIGHT
@MarkAWebster1 it's ok to ignore human rights violations and women being treated as "second class citizens" when it's about oil.
@MarkAWebster1 oh...so it's ok if we need oil but god forbid if we reach out to a country for  the sake of diplomacy.
@MarkAWebster1 sure buddy.
@MarkAWebster1 bush and republican admin was extremely close to Saudi.
@MarkAWebster1 you realize the U.S. Is close with Saudi and have been for decades? Oh...you don't.
@MarkAWebster1 potus is the only one brave enough to call israel on their bullshit. This does not make him an anti Semite.
@MarkAWebster1 but they won't have the capability of dropping a nuclear bomb on their enemies. THATS THE POINT
@MarkAWebster1 typical. Don't want war must love terrorists.
@MarkAWebster1 yeah I get that and I has nothing to do with this. It's not about loving Iran. It's about preventing war. Straw man.
@MarkAWebster1 we will want to and you know it. Republicans want war. Pay attention. Read up.
@MarkAWebster1 you think they can handle a nuclear Iran?
@MarkAWebster1 yeah. I do.
@MarkAWebster1 we are in a circular argument. Again, wake up.
@MarkAWebster1 they are Volatile toward each other. Again a peaceful resolution is ideal. There's no point in not trying.
@MarkAWebster1 and an alternative is peaceful negotiations. Which we are currently working on which the republicans almost fucked up.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith that doesn't even make sense.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith so why not at least try? They're going to have their nuclear program either way.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith you think we won't get involved? Wake up
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith do some research man.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith are you high? They've been promoting an Israeli-Iran war as opposed to peaceful diplomacy.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith Even fellow republicans and conservative papers thought it was tremendously stupid.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith whether or not it was illegal, it very much jeopardized the negotiations that were taking place.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith republicans want Israel to go into Iran and begin a conflict with our support. That's the end game.
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith riiiiight
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith and making Iran wary of negotiating with us now or in future?
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith and not an effort to undermine negotiations in favor of war with Iran?
@MarkAWebster1 @stephenasmith so you think it was just a good faith effort to inform Iran on how treaties work, even tho it's not a treaty?
@MarkAWebster1 @ih8gops @stephenasmith it isn't. Because it's not a treaty. Congress doesn't get a say in negotiations.
Trillion Dollar Fraudsters 

Rich get richer.
@jacksfilms God damn you people.
@juanstie @MartiniWife @sazmosey @bychristinebswk she actually said that?
@CourtPencil @patticakes211 @juanstie absolutely. It's a sociopathic hallmark. She probably finds their naïveté pathetic and hilarious.
@shelster07 @juanstie looks like it's gone again.
@bychristinebswk @juanstie "#WINNING" ? Really?
@EatchelJacque @juanstie @faithwillsave4 or intelligence.
@juanstie @faithwillsave4 so that she could post " WE WON!" knowing the stunt would set off a storm of hate and backlash? She thrives on it
@juanstie @faithwillsave4 curious...if she was so afraid of harassment, why did she March into belly of beast (travis supporter fb page)
@HeaIthDaily just a poorly executed garcinia Cambodia ad. False advertising.
@HeaIthDaily @FitGirINow impossible. I've seen this before and after for at least a year now maybe more. Cannot be from Nov.
@dallasmavs btw that was not a goal tend on aminu. still got win though #MavsWINNNNNN #ORLvDAL
@MIMIBVAVAL @bychristinebswk @TwiceIrish @LovePinkGurl54 @Teri423 she still has money in commis she just can't by food ws my understanding.
@pryneyes @juanstie reactivated on accident, I mean
@pryneyes @juanstie you're right! Maybe she did on accident? <EYES>
@Felicia250 @juanstie @Daladydee @bychristinebswk @emperorsartori1 appears so.
@word_34 @TransAmnesia ok
@word_34 @TransAmnesia we didn't get too in depth. I don't care for drama but I get the feeling now.
@word_34 @TransAmnesia yes I don't follow closely and we were discussing on another site
@TransAmnesia @word_34 I'm starting to get your feelings on this poster...
@jeffgoldesq fair enough Jeff. You're a good man.
@jeffgoldesq @bychristinebswk @juanstie IF this is true Jeff, what is 'MDLR looking at here? Thanks?
@bychristinebswk @jeffgoldesq @juanstie @ericksonvision do u thnk thts y she deletdand that the info is still avail through Twitter records?
@troyhaydenfox10 the old "threats" excuse. Her Twitter was blocked and you had to be approved to follow her...
@juanstie @DerrickSlone nope still there.
@jeffgoldesq I'm intrigued.
@JoeDanaReports @TrialDiariesJ BS.
@teach2s lol ok there you are. Hi!
@TransAmnesia thanks for all your level headedness too.
@TransAmnesia I know sometimes I wonder why I try. Lol. We will get there!
@TransAmnesia hello! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@brahmresnik watching the voir dire of 17 now said her husband was sent 2 prsn after they divorced lie Was married 2 and spoke at sentencing
@juanstie @Banyarola @KarlaMNL @capemayniac thank you!!!
@juanstie @Banyarola @KarlaMNL @capemayniac this isn't the big jodi news that was teased was it? Thanks.
@mlmkareem consent was not needed.
@TrialDiariesJ I thought it was interesting reading your article how the evidence became clear to them even in their jury bubble.
@TrialDiariesJ has anyone asked the jurors specifically what they thought about the pedophilia claims?
@jeffgoldesq @thegoldpatrol I do not understand why these are allowed but "nfl you saw who I was with" is too prejudicial.
@Pgarza47 thanks*
@Pgarza47 thank luv ya too!
@bamacub78 @CindyFinan @TrialDiariesJ @tarakelley320 he was sentenced a day after their wedding. It doesn't make sense.
@bamacub78 @CindyFinan @TrialDiariesJ @tarakelley320 they may not be able to prove it but I seriously doubt she'd forget JM
@tarakelley320 @TrialDiariesJ @bamacub78 I think she knew too. No way she didn't. But agree it will be hard to prove.
@TrialDiariesJ @tarakelley320 @bamacub78 also someone may come forward and say hey, she did know, she talked about it
@TrialDiariesJ do you know where I can watch juan and Bill Montgomery's press statements? Thanks!

Jury coming in #jodiarias #3tvarias
@TrialDiariesJ Jen did the Alexanders look teary? If it was still hung I'd think they'd be crying. Could this be a verdict reached?
@TrialDiariesJ @juanstie @stellabella310 @JuryCockpot he's gotta be trolling right???
@TrialDiariesJ I will be shocked if they don't win this one too. Apparently all evidence against him is prejudicial.
@TrialDiariesJ I love that. Maybe they want to work through lunch.
@TrialDiariesJ thank u. I was thinking huh? I can't see any juror doing that.
@TrialDiariesJ sum1 on BK's site posted that a juror was heard crying loud after Nurmi was done. I did not see this anywhere else. Any info?
@TrialDiariesJ oh my god....
@jeffgoldesq I feel like when judge says stuff like this it prejudices the jury more than not. Which she is trying to avoid.
@jeffgoldesq maybe Boston laws are just different.
@jeffgoldesq -_- makes no sense to me.
@TrialDiariesJ smh...
@TrialDiariesJ @JarrettSeltzer lol!!!
@jeffgoldesq I think he did it or was at least involved.
@jeffgoldesq do you think the state if building a solid circumstantial case?
@jeffgoldesq depends on if he was texting or on the phone at the time.
@jeffgoldesq I can't understand why the judge won't let  that in.
@LoriPilarcik page 26 is missing.
@TrialDiariesJ oy. Lol.
@twizzy7 @TrialDiariesJ exactly. Nothing more.
@TrialDiariesJ that's the biggest bs i ever heard.
@jeffgoldesq @tjsmith59 @TraciMorrison3 wow!
@courtchatter I hope part of his complaint Cathy is that Marc mcgee's name has been known for while and everyone already knew who it was.
@TrialDiariesJ Jen, mikal says they were about to eat Mexican and were singing about the restaurant. It had nothing to do with MDLR
@TrialDiariesJ @mitchiepoo46 this is getting stupid. The judge is not a kindergarten teacher you tattle to when someone owies your feelings.
@JustBeatrice1 how do you know this? Are you just guessing?
@TrialDiariesJ gah maybe juan finally dug out the copyright law that says there's an exception for use in a court of law.
@TrialDiariesJ thank GOD. I'm sorry but what a buffoon.
@da_horton crazy. I JUST finished watching Fruitvale Station. Credits rolling. Too sad.
@TrialDiariesJ so she's a Jekyll and Hyde too, ok then.
@cshughes hi Chris. Sum1 told me travis family are not ok with the book and I don't believe it. Is that true and do how they feel? Thanks
@TrialDiariesJ be on look out for new users following you...
@The13thJurorMD waiting for the recap, can't wait!
@TrialDiariesJ this is letter to Travis' family
@FodieJ royal blue I mean
@FodieJ they always manage to get royal on either Jodi or themselves to take focus off the Alexander's. So immature.
@TrialDiariesJ copyright!
@TrialDiariesJ yeah let's say.
@TrialDiariesJ jake probably confessed.
@TrialDiariesJ let me back it up a little bit...oh lord.
@TrialDiariesJ twist ending!
@jeffgoldesq is he charged with second?
@D204Dale @TrialDiariesJ lets see evidence first.
@BobMcGovernJr @karmicaaron not really fair since the state can't talk about the other murders Odin allegedly knew about
@TrialDiariesJ I keep expecting this judge to say "how 'bout them apples?"
@TrialDiariesJ what the heck??? What is happening lol.
@jeffgoldesq what other jurors would there be??
@jeffgoldesq @thegoldpatrol he prolly won't then.
Nurmi is up ....ya know cause it's porn talk #jodiari…
@TrialDiariesJ passing tweets.
@youmustchange @esneet4113 I rememebr the mags from court very well. Just wanted deets about juan being the one to make discovery.
@cherylw358 @esneet4113 @youmustchange  ain't got time fo dat. Thanks anyway.
@cherylw358 @esneet4113 @youmustchange  thank you I never heard that! Any details on it, what he saw her doing, etc??
@TrialDiariesJ lol of course
@monicalindstrom not really though. They spent the entire mit case trashing the victim now they're presenting cross evidence in a motion.
@monicalindstrom and?
@WildAboutTrial lol!
@esneet4113 @youmustchange lol where did you read this? Do you have a link tia. That's awesome.
@TrialDiariesJ @The13thJurorMD juror 1 male or female? Jc. Thanks.
@DKaechler @TrialDiariesJ me too. But that's ok. That's what deliberations are for.
@TrialDiariesJ what about you? Some people who are reading them on BK says they are not good for state. What do you think?
@TrialDiariesJ overall, awesome. A couple worried me, but overall I loved them. Someone sounds down right pissed lol.
@twizzy7 @TrialDiariesJ yes if i'm reading them right. Whoever is asking isn't buying it.
@TrialDiariesJ I like where this is going lol.
@TrialDiariesJ oh my gosh I like these so far.
@TrialDiariesJ they are her handwriting.
@TrialDiariesJ copyright thing Is dumb. Use of tests in trial is protected by fair use. Judge making it harder than it needs to be.
@TrialDiariesJ oh hey thanks Geff! Bring em on then!
@TrialDiariesJ jury in now?
@jeffgoldesq Abdelhadi!
@Barbara37391440 @TrialDiariesJ the jury is in
@TrialDiariesJ hope Juan hits on that the Internet thing couldn't have been mistake because it's in two separate sets of notes.
@TrialDiariesJ good morning Jen.
@azcentral @william_pitts they're a little early...
@TrialDiariesJ thank you so much. This is heartbreaking news.
@TrialDiariesJ did you confirm it with a reliable source? Thanks.
@TrialDiariesJ did it resonate with the jury, you think?
@TrialDiariesJ wow. What a way to end the day.
@TrialDiariesJ yes!!!!
@maryellenabc15 she changed it. On the stand he was lying in bed. Because no one masturbates on their knees lol.
@TrialDiariesJ it's only about what Travis was doing. Jodi good. Travis bad. Always.
@TrialDiariesJ lol oh ok. It doesn't matter that Jodi changed the position he was in in her story.
@TrialDiariesJ did Juan point out it was never sent or is this an observation? Thanks
@TrialDiariesJ so how is Juan doing? Is it landing with jury?
@TrialDiariesJ alright here we go.
@maryellenabc15 if both know its a breakup then yes! Jodi testified they were officially broken up but he was "courting her." Doesn't matter
@maryellenabc15 'cept they were broken up so she wasn't the other woman!
@maryellenabc15 no he's saying Marc McGee was married and he did not live with the bishop when he claims this happened.
@TrialDiariesJ oopsie
@maryellenabc15 Marc McGee.
@TrialDiariesJ God bless America!
@jeffgoldesq 6 days on direct. 6. Days.
@TrialDiariesJ lol!
@maryellenabc15 lol that's a spin. Some might call that laziness.
@TrialDiariesJ god I hope so.
@TrialDiariesJ lol!!!!
@TrialDiariesJ they are irrelevant affidavits. They should have gotten actual statements from@them.
@TrialDiariesJ no the content is improper. They don't get to talk about their opinions of the first trial or of the Alexander's.
@jeffgoldesq excellent excellent gold patrol. I love listening to you talk law because you make everything so easy to understand. Thanks!

Motion To Dismiss Death - DENIED

#JodiArias
@TrialDiariesJ motion to dismiss denied.
@william_pitts lol no. Trust me, it isn't.
@TrialDiariesJ duuuuuuude
@TrialDiariesJ a list of clients who use EnCase, including Homeland security. Hardly grade school  
@TrialDiariesJ oh my god...
@TrialDiariesJ BOOM!
@TrialDiariesJ yes smith, one plus one is two.
@TrialDiariesJ not for forensics numnuts.
@TrialDiariesJ clearly a virus.
@TrialDiariesJ lol what a perv!!!!
@jeffgoldesq omg yes!
@jeffgoldesq I was just thinking this. This is the real reason she didn't want the public to see.
@TrialDiariesJ Is there anything the state CAN use?
@monicalindstrom there was also apparently a hearing a while back where Nurmi asked for this image along with all electronic data.
@monicalindstrom they knew it existed though. They made their own in 2009 which still had porn urls in the registry despite the mods.
@monicalindstrom uh no. There's a difference. The urls in the registry are NOT visits. The state has not said there were visits save one
@monicalindstrom has the jury been out this whole time?!?!
@monicalindstrom GP even said he would have gotten a court order if they stopped him.
@TrialDiariesJ like the dismissed juror said, he's consistent lol.
@TrialDiariesJ he did though.
@TrialDiariesJ mountains out of mole hills.
@TrialDiariesJ exactly!
@TrialDiariesJ only one lawyer heard that. Gary Parzych never reported that.
@TrialDiariesJ it was already on.
@monicalindstrom @slawler2 she clearly denied the motion.
@TrialDiariesJ give them pseudonyms
@TrialDiariesJ uh there wasn't.
@monicalindstrom yeah gonna go with the latter......
@TrialDiariesJ and only one site in history does not a porn habit make.
@TrialDiariesJ yay!
@TrialDiariesJ yeah those are called pop ups Amish John.
@WildAboutTrial @TrialDiariesJ so misleading. We already know the modifications are due to the defense asking to have the computer turned on
@TrialDiariesJ that's f*cken shady.
@maryellenabc15 loo oh my god...
@TrialDiariesJ psssst...your witness said it too.
@TrialDiariesJ ah cougarlouscious...the gift that keeps on giving.
@DaniSierralynn @TrialDiariesJ @Fairweathertwit you're not!
@TrialDiariesJ pseudonym?
@PattyLangston2 @juanstie @TrialDiariesJ what added BS?
@TrialDiariesJ from what?!?
@juanstie @TrialDiariesJ can you fill me in? What journal BS? Thanks.
@charlesadler he was holding his face mask. You can clearly see it in the other angle. How can you call PI on that?
My heart's too big. I feel bad for Suh right now.
@StevenDavidMoor @wingoz that defense was BEAST though. That was our toughest game of the season.
@StevenDavidMoor @RealSkipBayless
@StevenDavidMoor @wingoz I was agreeing witchu!
@StevenDavidMoor @wingoz he was holding on to him refs made the right call.
@RealSkipBayless that's how you respond. He could have given up but he fought. Beautiful.
@MeeBee23: I'm glad I didn't miss @andersoncooper 's grunge phase. @kathygriffin is cracking me up #CNNNYE #TonyRomoforMVP
@Lana lol shut the fuck up
@jodiarias_gb @william_pitts even if they do, the defense cannot present evidence that asks them to reconsider. They are legally not allowed
@jodiarias_gb @william_pitts they are not allowed to reconsider her guilt or premeditation.
@MRAS77 @Jurygal08 @WildAboutTrial lol!!
@william_pitts @ChrissyMac4 they probably won't take it.
@TrialDiariesJ Eric Williams got the death penalty.
@FrankCaliendo guess we'll never know. #CowboysWin #CowboysHour #BelieveInDemBoys
I want to win eleventhgorgeous' HUGE Holiday Giveaway!! #EGsHolidayGiveaway @11thGorgeous <SNOWFLAKE> 
@radleybalko definitely gonna jump in and agree with McCullough. Who presents defense evidence to a grand jury instead of your own?
@radleybalko John Guy's re-prosecution of Michael Dunn was great. Nominating for best of 2014.
@TrialDiariesJ huh?
@michaelbkiefer he didn't turn it on, he tapped the space key and woke it up. That's not against protocol.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady responding to your incorrect information.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady not me. The expert on the stand now. Just follow it. BN fucked up.
@Momma_to_6 @monicalindstrom I've looked. He does tech extractions and verifications. He is not a forensics expert.
@monicalindstrom it shows he didn't do a proper eval. Things from BN's computer, including incinerator, shouldn't be on expert's copy
@Momma_to_6 @monicalindstrom doing tech extractions. Not computer forensics. Following testimony now?  He Has no idea what he was doing.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom by a man whose expertise is not in computer forensics. Write blockers only need used BEFORE copy
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom but image was made. It didn't matter at that point.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom at defense request. Any time you turn computer on overwrites and changes happen.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom the image they'd had.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom BEFORE the image is made...this was well after. Flores noted any changed made could be compared to
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom hard drive needed in evidence. Alterations to drive at that point not a big deal.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom other att said she needed to view files sizes to bill their expert. Seems like standard practice.
@Momma_to_6 @StaplerLady @monicalindstrom defense attorney already said if they'd tried to stop him he'd have gotten court order
@monicalindstrom he said many times they had to evidence-the mirror image of hard drive. It wasn't a bit deal.
@TrialDiariesJ @tammylynne67 @CollinsCasandra @JVM @DarrenKavinoky lol she took hard...ya think? O.o
@TrialDiariesJ if I sub now can I hear it?
@TrialDiariesJ if I subscribe now can I hear it?
@michaelbkiefer it is a program. Incinerator 2.3. Google it.
@azmatthews @WildAboutTrial lol Spybot is fine.
@StevenDavidMoor @monicalindstrom and if PD is so at fault for letting the DT turn the comp on, what is BN for using an incinerator on it!!!
@StevenDavidMoor @monicalindstrom I think Spybot and BN's incinerator is the culprit behind the deletions. No one to blame, not even PD.
@monicalindstrom Spybot is an antivirus program. It targets viruses.
@jeffgoldesq they obviously didn't. They couldn't have.
@monicalindstrom yeah, I pretty much got it...gonna need more than 140 characters though: main point: it wasn't Juan. Couldn't have been.
@monicalindstrom when defense makes a request, what are they to do? If they'd refused, they'd have been accused of summin else. Can't win.
@monicalindstrom they had a copy!!!!
@monicalindstrom exactly!!!
@monicalindstrom he probably does.
@mrk21000 you'd think wrong. These things get turned over on appeal all the time whether subpoenas issued or not. Ineffective assistance.
@mrk21000 @EmsterD70 he's subpoenaing them himself to eliminate the appeal issue they've created. He's making them testify.
@TrialDiariesJ yay!!!
@TrialDiariesJ does dr f come across as bad in the courtroom as she does in the tweets when she plays those games with Juan????
@monicalindstrom @Momma_to_6 but it wasn't even 6 (Greenwich time) hours and it was a two way conversation that dropped out and picked up.
@ericksonvision obviously, the constitution is hurting ja's ability to defend her life. The forefathers should have thought of that.
@occupyhln @maryellenabc15 are you denying what's plainly written in the COA decision papers?
@ericksonvision you totally did break that news, good reporting!
@ericksonvision thank you!!!!! It was a good one!
@TrialDiariesJ that's rich seeing as the entire defense case is sex...
@TrialDiariesJ ridiculous. When Demarte was asked about objectivity last year she had no idea it was referring to anyone specific
@WildAboutTrial can you bring back the other guy to tweet...?
@KillersLie @cshughes I didn't name call either. I said you were ignorant meaning ignorant of the facts and of what ch has said before.
@KillersLie @Justice4TravisA @cshughes you're free to yours too. It's just a little ignorant.
@KillersLie @Justice4TravisA @cshughes so I already knew everything he was talking about.
@KillersLie @Justice4TravisA @cshughes no it's not. Chris has talked about this so many times. Gave a similar interview last year.
@KillersLie @Justice4TravisA @cshughes can you clarify what you are saying here?
@monicalindstrom that's an interesting way to spin "poorly researched" I'd think context would be important.
@TrialDiariesJ she clearly said it was indicator of his pedophilia...can't go back now.
@The13thJurorMD @hardtruth4real @bunnykittenpupp @NancyGraceHLN I figured you guys had mercy on the kids. Understandable.
@TrialDiariesJ Lmao what a child!
@TrialDiariesJ sounds like it's going pretty well...what about you???
@monicalindstrom again, not his job. She's a big girl capable of her own due diligence. She just didn't want to find anything else.
@TrialDiariesJ it's like republicans pretending george w bush didn't happen.
@TrialDiariesJ lol it's not really. But ok.
@monicalindstrom isn't that all she talked about for like 4 days?!?!?!
@monicalindstrom that isn't his job.
@monicalindstrom the gall...
@monicalindstrom @sneakyjuror don't you want to hear the state's side first?
@monicalindstrom @Cali_Girl090 but her own defense saw image from 2008 post deletions and didn't see this stuff.
@monicalindstrom her own experts didn't find the porn either. There's a reason. And it's not to set her up.
@monicalindstrom she said there was CHILD porn
@sneakyjuror this hearing is about deletions made in 2009. Not about accusations that a mirror wasn't made...because it was. You're confused
@sneakyjuror to discuss Travis' hard drive. Not the point. Please direct me to where BN said no mirror of this hard drive was made in 2008.
@sneakyjuror @monicalindstrom yes a copy was made in 2008. This expert has not said otherwise. You're just making things up.
@monicalindstrom none of the above! This is so stupid!
@sneakyjuror @monicalindstrom I think you are confusing two separate issues....
@sneakyjuror @monicalindstrom defense expert Dworkin did an analysis back in 2012 and says he used a copy of hard drive made in 2008.
@sneakyjuror @monicalindstrom neumeister never said a copy was never made, what are you taking about? Are you confused?
@sneakyjuror @monicalindstrom but there was. So that is incorrect.
@sneakyjuror @monicalindstrom um, there was. Both experts testified to using a mirror image to do analysis.
@monicalindstrom they were complying with a request. They already had a mirror image so didn't seem like big deal
@WildAboutTrial yes! The more details the better!
@Banyarola @TrialDiariesJ huh?
@realtiydiva @TrialDiariesJ ???? lol....
@TrialDiariesJ how'd our Juan so? Was he too confusing?
@ericksonvision omniscient, as in all-knowing. That's what Juan was trying to say.
@TrialDiariesJ omniscient.
@monicalindstrom agree. His brain works too fast. He just needs to sloooooow down.
@monicalindstrom yes. And the defense didn't give it to her. Set her up.
@monicalindstrom lacking context.
@monicalindstrom at the bench though?
Please #BringBackEleventhGorgeous @YouTube @YTCreators @11thGorgeous 
@TrialDiariesJ think Juan will get a shot tomorrow?
@jeffgoldesq what an embarrassment...
@TrialDiariesJ Jen new motion filed by Juan, do you have it?
@_DelReyCNN there's no court tomorrow anyway so you're off the hook!
@ericksonvision state vs Jodi arias FB page?
@monicalindstrom depends on who asked for it and why doesn't it? And since the majority of trial is held in secret, we don't know which.
@g_rossi @michaelbkiefer he's like their Fox News.
@michaelbkiefer that is NOT what the motion says! Why don't you post it and show everyone, it's all over twitter!
@_DelReyCNN oh, absolutely. He's giving her that rope.
@_DelReyCNN wow, clever way of negating all the wonderful things Travis' exes said about him.
@_DelReyCNN are you saying he's fast paced and exciting?
@TrialDiariesJ @BarbAtlinburg prolly not they stil have the texts to dissect and pedophile accusations to make. Gonna be a long day Jen.
@ESPNSteinLine @ESPNSteinLine despite the alleged tip, which is hard to see, they didn't start the clock when it hit lee's hands. Robbed.
@TrialDiariesJ lol at grab my coffee. Hoping Juan is up today.
@TrialDiariesJ @Wildfire_Jones @jeffgoldesq @WildAboutTrial SOMEONE ELSE is taking her tweets and placing Jeff and wat's name on them
@LiseLasalle @TrialDiariesJ Jen is freelance and this is her blog. She's not bound by the obligation of neutrality. At least she's thorough
@TrialDiariesJ @ThatGrieta @chdeerob I think I know who's doing this and I think I know why they're changing you name.
@TrialDiariesJ holy crap, you did write this, I remember the mic drop! They are actually deleting your name and writing in another name. Wow
@TrialDiariesJ wow...same people who run state vs Jodi arias page?
#BringBackEleventhGorgeous please!!!
@monicalindstrom no. Opinion unchanged.
@ericksonvision she was let back in so she probably wasn't doing that. Her phone probably just went off...
@michaelbkiefer @azcentral what does it matter? Deletions clearly no one's fault. The motion was erroneous. We move on.
@TrialDiariesJ oh yes.
@monicalindstrom he was a serial dater. And?
@monicalindstrom that I believe.
@monicalindstrom I'm sure they get the point by now!
@jeffgoldesq but he didn't love her? To quote Samantha "hogwash"

@TrialDiariesJ what do they look like right now?
@monicalindstrom the Hughes claimed they were manipulated by Jodi.
@TrialDiariesJ yah that's not lying. Ugh!
@TrialDiariesJ other way around...thirsty for Travis and got into religion.
@monicalindstrom @audrey_m @commonsense258 but if it was a virus, and sure seems like it, not exculpatory, right? Wouldn have helped anyway?
@monicalindstrom @commonsense258 except it should never have been turned on. That's someone's fault.
@monicalindstrom @commonsense258 no one's fault.
@monicalindstrom @commonsense258 personally, I think defense wanted it booted up and an antivirus began running and started deleting files.
@TrialDiariesJ oh geez...
@TrialDiariesJ I'm so nervous...
@RedTailspin @jeffgoldesq @courtchatter I read it. 5/28 and onward, right around the time Jodi began planning slaughter. Obvious.
@jeffgoldesq if the sites are shown to be viruses, would that negate its possibly exculpatory status? Or is it an appeal win either way?
@jeffgoldesq @thegoldpatrol @courtchatter based on the dates listed Jodi planted the virus.
@ericksonvision meh already seen it. I has a sad.
@ericksonvision *facepalm* so what expert needs dismantling this time?
@courtchatter @hotair25159 they had an expert examine it!
@jeffgoldesq I'm saying...DT experts have been bought and paid for before...what's changed now?
@jeffgoldesq don't drink the koolaid Jeff, come on...
@jeffgoldesq doubtful.
@jeffgoldesq Why would they destroy the porn evidence before Jodi was even arrested and had made up the abuse/pedophile lies?
@jeffgoldesq seems like you can pay an expert to say anything these days...right Alyce.
@michaelbkiefer @azcentral ah, destroyed evidence 1 month before Jodi was arrstd makes no sense Porn wasn't evidence of anything at that pnt
@michaelbkiefer if this is true then open up the case to the media Nurmi! Shout it from the rooftops!
@jeffgoldesq @michaelbkiefer lol...consider the source. I'll wait for more on this one. If this is true then let the media see it Nurmi!

How many retweets deserves this hero? 
@monicalindstrom but she wasn't off the bench???
@Teri423 @monicalindstrom oy vey...
@jeffgoldesq bwahaha!
@TrialDiariesJ the ole bait them into "threatening" us. Don't fall for it people.
@coalBUCKETLIST @ericksonvision oh my goodness you're right! No refraction!
@jeffgoldesq now Nurmi pitches a fit and declares no more witnesses will be called.
@monicalindstrom @Sunshine3324 he's opposed to a stay, but is he in favor of closed court?
@monicalindstrom not a chance.
@monicalindstrom witnesses shouldn't get to blackmail the courts IMO. Never seen this in my life
@monicalindstrom it's all a game, really. Who cares anymore?
@monicalindstrom weirdest trial evaaaaaar...
@monicalindstrom isn't that a little over the top monica Can't they just instruct the camera men not film them and media not to tweet names?
@ericksonvision I knew it!!!!!!!
@TrialDiariesJ heard through the grapevine that they are.
@ESPN_FirstTake YES!!!
@TrialDiariesJ good morning Jen! I hope you have your blood pressure medicine with you! ;)
@monicalindstrom naturally, since he's just copying Juan Martinez.
@ericksonvision @monicalindstrom @jeffgoldesq @TrialDiariesJ @WildAboutTrial and to you Dave!
@TrialDiariesJ honest opinion? Was it a bad day for the state??
@TrialDiariesJ did Nurmi question Flores about a book he was (wasn't writing? Think he confused him for Chris Hughes?
@TrialDiariesJ @_LOVEINVAIN he's just a huge interrupter. I don't like it!
@TrialDiariesJ @_LOVEINVAIN he does that, lol.
@TrialDiariesJ I hope the jury is thoroughly disgusted.
@monicalindstrom dunno know if they'll hate it but I can't imagine they'll like it.
@ericksonvision comorboities of PDs usually exist. She has BPD and ASPD. That's where the lack of remorse and empathy come in.
@monicalindstrom this lying is neither BPD nor PTSD, it's antisocial personality disorder: sociopathy. And I'm sure they see that.
@monicalindstrom NO!
@monicalindstrom number of victims makes no diff to me.
@ericksonvision lol. My thoughts exactly.
@monicalindstrom what's the diff between video and transcripts?
@ericksonvision making pancakes with my little girl!
@monicalindstrom @bospetbowtique I believe Demarte will clarify the difference between a mental illness and a personality disorder.
@kissara22 @monicalindstrom also, part of mitigation was she was attacked...Juan showing premeditation.
@monicalindstrom plausible but it would be highly coincidental.
@ericksonvision lol!!!
@ericksonvision don't worry other tweeters say he's there today so you're probably right.
@ericksonvision @BethKaras @NancyGraceHLN or dr. Horn
@StevenDavidMoor they just showed one of your tweets on Dr. Drew!
@TrialDiariesJ how do you think jury is responding to respective attorneys? Thanks.
@monicalindstrom the jury must be so confused right now!
@RedTailspin @monicalindstrom @TrialDiariesJ I don't care what anyone does with their sex life. But Jodi has misrepresented hers. That diff
@freelancewoman I know this...I'm just saying no one is slut shaming here. That's not what it is about. I get what you're saying though
@freelancewoman it's not about that. She's lying. It's pointing out her innocent victim act. You're missing the point.
@freelancewoman @monicalindstrom @TrialDiariesJ don't you this DT has done a fair amount of slut shaming of Travis?
@freelancewoman this isn't about slut shaming. It's her life. She's claiming to be an innocent little virtuous Mormon too and she wasn't.
@NancyGraceHLN doesn't make sense. Nv, ut, SoCal were alibis. Never used card in AZ even though she'd gone through. Premeditation.
@monicalindstrom @troyhaydenfox10 agree she's looking a little rough these days.
@monicalindstrom @TrialDiariesJ but goes slightly against the virginal Mormon girl act. Only slightly
@ericksonvision you're quite right she's the most fame seeking defendant ever. I've never seen anything like it.
@monicalindstrom no. She could have stabbed him while holding the knife blade up and stabbing upwards. If that makes sense.
@ericksonvision right???
@monicalindstrom @AKChica9 mmmmm, Travis' deep defensive wounds vs, Jodi's lack of defensive wounds...doesn't help her, IMO.
@ericksonvision @HLNNowTV I'm there!!!!

He's played 38 games for them. 
@DKaechler @monicalindstrom besides they're allowed to have prior knowledge of case, just not allowed to have formed opinion on sentence.
@monicalindstrom why not? He's playing the defense's shock game.
@monicalindstrom that's odd I thought defense goes first here.
@monicalindstrom I'm confused...these are opening ARGUMENTS right?
@TrialDiariesJ just say you are sorry!!!! Not horrified, not mortified! Apologize! That's remorse!
@monicalindstrom do you think the DT will pull back a bit on the all out Villianization of TA this time around? Nurmi doesn't sound as harsh
@monicalindstrom that's new...

@TrialDiariesJ oh lawdy...fight the good fight, Wilma...
@jeffgoldesq @thegoldpatrol oh the lap top holds these letters! So why are they just now digging for them? They're bunk. GMAB
@monicalindstrom @strong4895 but they did finish didn't they?
@TrialDiariesJ and you're very thorough!
@TrialDiariesJ btw you're the best trial tweeter out there right now. You are remarkably more unbiased than actual professionals.
@Henri_DelRey those letters will not be let it in. It's a dangerous thing to allow something like that in to defend yourself.
@AutumnNAlston apparently....
@AutumnNAlston her own diary? They're just convenient lies to make people think Travis deserved to die. And hey any moron will buy that crap
@AutumnNAlston her DIARY said she though it was hot, not that she went along with it, that it was hot. Who is she trying to go along with in
@AutumnNAlston saying what he said does not equate to "I like 12 year old girls." It was just a throw away comment during phone sex.
@AutumnNAlston not even a little bit is it the same. I would defend any guy who was called a pedophile over such an innocuous comment.
@AutumnNAlston really? How many pedos you know with zero porn in their possession? None, not one.
@AutumnNAlston he was commenting on how young she sounded and she did sound young because she was trying to.
@AutumnNAlston uh no he didn't. He said you sound like a 12 year old girl having her first orgasm. That's not the same at all.
@AutumnNAlston yeah he did not say that at all abt 12 yr old girl. Jodi thought tootsie pops were hot too, read her diary.
@AutumnNAlston sexually creepy? The man didn't even have any porn on his computers. Jodi, however, many pics of her boobs on hers.
@42fenchurch @starknightz @TrialDiariesJ ironically, found nothing sexual on TA's lap top or computer.
@42fenchurch @starknightz @TrialDiariesJ her hard drive was destroyed but they had her lap top and found many pics if boobs on it.
@TrialDiariesJ doesn't really seem fair that the accusations get to be public but jm's defense against them are sealed.
@ericksonvision thats not the point really Ppl were just pointing out you got it wrong and that JSS did not agree the pros was being snarky
@monicalindstrom really? The pinwheel and motion is one thing, but if she threatened trial participants I feel the jury should know that...
@jeffgoldesq yeah that didn't work out like she thought it would did it?  Not smiling now, I bet.
@TrialDiariesJ it's frustrating the jury won't hear any of this.
@ericksonvision wait jeff gold said she disagreed the JM was snarky. Which is it?
@monicalindstrom ugh...
@monicalindstrom maybe. Don't mean he'll win though. The judge will probably just tell him to fit the interview in before 21st.
@AlexCrawfordSky good question. That's exactly the thought I had.
@renaes24 @jodiarias_gb it doesn't even make sense. He absolutely bought the premeditated part because he voted for it. Just didn't think DP
@jodiarias_gb uh, then why did he vote for premeditated murder?
@ericksonvision truth!!!
@11thGorgeous highlight of my Mondays.
Oh yeah Stephen A! #BelieveDemBoys
@jeffgoldesq statistically they do, right? Isn't state usually successful in securing DP in pen phase retrials? I'll wait 4 show lol
I just entered to #win &amp; you can too: "IPHONE 6 PRIZE PACK!". Enter the #giveaway here: 
I just entered to #win &amp; you can too: "IPHONE 6 PRIZE PACK!". Enter the #giveaway here: 
@FOX2News @TrialDiariesJ so that's it I guess. He's free to go.
@Kelphotography @TrialDiariesJ just read it.
@FOX2Erika @TrialDiariesJ @FOX2News question answered
@TrialDiariesJ Allen charge now or it's over?
@wpbf_terri @TrialDiariesJ @WPBF25News that's hardcore...
@TrialDiariesJ @JarrettSeltzer demanding respect for the great SW, of course
@TrialDiariesJ wow!!!
@monicalindstrom he's simply concerned about stealth jurors. I would be too. Anyone who wants life for Jodi is less likely to speak up.
@ericksonvision he can probably feel their dishonesty.
@monicalindstrom don't understand what he means.
@monicalindstrom if I was Nurmi, older men. They seem to love her.
@monicalindstrom more women for sure.
@TrialDiariesJ he's not making sense. If ur opposed ur opposed.
@monicalindstrom I would. Lds members would know when she's being untruthful about something
@rbaumannjr @GOPBlackChick exactly.
@rbaumannjr @GOPBlackChick I think it's sad he felt that was his only chance. Would we have brought him in the way we did those patients? No
@GOPBlackChick @Tayllorred this is sad. All he wanted was a chance. And he died anyway.
@MerellaCTV I'm heart broke.
@ClubLove13 @TrialDiariesJ stop making sense clublove!
@TrialDiariesJ thanks Jen. You've been awesome.
@TrialDiariesJ shouldn't those with experience with DV be stricken? It's hard for some DV victims to be impartial.
@TrialDiariesJ @sacgrl09 lol!
@lax32mom @monicalindstrom there's not a new judge! Only a diff judge will be handling ja's handwritten motion. That's it.
@jeffgoldesq @FreeJodi_Arias @soniareiter @Jodi_AnnArias wow! Over 10 people!? That's like a soccer team of supporters right there.
@jeffgoldesq exactly!!!!! She has regrets NOW that there's a real possibility she'll get the death penalty.
@jeffgoldesq @Jodi_AnnArias she never wanted to go near trial because she'd be found guilty.
@soniareiter @TrialDiariesJ actually jeff gold says she's gone. She's the DV woman.
@soniareiter @TrialDiariesJ Juan will definitely strike her.
@TrialDiariesJ SAMe young male who thought she deserved death?
@CasandraPicanco @monicalindstrom thought she shld die If this was just about fndng ppl who will kill her those people would still b here.
@CasandraPicanco @monicalindstrom his mind was made up. It's not about bias. It's the law. They've already stricken dozens of people who
@CasandraPicanco @monicalindstrom and it's perfectly fine to feel they way. But the fact is this man was a not going to be on this jury.
@talking_2_crazy I know that. I'm just responding to it. That's all.
@CasandraPicanco @monicalindstrom what? He already had his mind made up that she didn't qualify for DP. No one who's made up mind can serve.
@talking_2_crazy there is no way this man knows Travis and the DT knows this, which is why they ate trying to block the PT interview of him.
@talking_2_crazy @monicalindstrom very strange. I'm betting it's a j supporter with false stories. JM will get to the bottom of it.
@talking_2_crazy @monicalindstrom couldn't he be lying about having gone to school with Travis? That sounds very fishy.
@talking_2_crazy @SphynxCatsRule @monicalindstrom who is it???
@Kristyannasmom @monicalindstrom Jeff gold says he was stricken.
@starshine9160 @jeffgoldesq he's outta here!
@monicalindstrom then they can't serve because Jodi is not a Dahmer or a repeat offender. This person would not give it to her.
@TrialDiariesJ she wants to save her.
@monicalindstrom I thought anyone who knew someone involved in the case couldn't be on jury?
@kirawylok @monicalindstrom for sure.
@TrialDiariesJ hmmmmmmmm
@nancygill @JVM exactly. Not one has been selected yet because there's another round to go. This tweet is trying to create drama.
@starshine9160 @JVM it'll be done on the 16th.
@JVM don't be silly, it's moving along as scheduled, we're not supposed to have a jury yet. Trial starts Oct. 20. We will be ready then
@TrialDiariesJ what was Nurmi saying about it.
@TrialDiariesJ @bobloblaw1717 @wycam1 said Kirk Nurmi.
@wycam1 and to you!
@Kristyannasmom @TrialDiariesJ it's used too seldom, yes. Same gal.
@TrialDiariesJ only that she did a head stand in interrogation room.
@TrialDiariesJ I don't think so. She doesn't seem to know too much about her.
@TrialDiariesJ are they on final jury or they still being vetted?
@TrialDiariesJ wearing them drives the value up.
@DrCaseyJordan yes I do.
@TrialDiariesJ that's just how he talks, no?
@geribouwman @SDavld @hardtruth4real @StabbysPencil @TrialDiariesJ send it to the state too please so he can expose the hypocrisy.
@jeffgoldesq what ya think of latest #jodiarias defense motion?
@WJXTvic @teezmepeas Jess saying she offered to Let guy talk at podium and he declined and let her answer a question for him. Not her fault
@WJXTvic thanks!!
@WJXTvic where can I watch the interview online?
@teezmepeas @WJXTvic 2 b fair, she kept trying to let other people talk but they kept deflecting to her, telling her to answer the q 4 them
@luvsmytwoboys agree 100% Kimberly. So much. They didn't try. They did In this retrial and it paid off.
@jonswaine @bassem_masri @GuardianUS they are lying? Video proves it!
@luvsmytwoboys and definitely felt Guy's heart in this the second time around.
@luvsmytwoboys I 2 think GZ got away with mrdr. But there wasn't the plethora of ev. that this case had. Too much rm for reasonable doubt.
@AnneWyattanne7 @TrialDiariesJ lol...anyone remember the psychopathic deviance score and how high it was?
@AnneWyattanne7 @TrialDiariesJ with more hours with Jodi.
@AnneWyattanne7 @TrialDiariesJ she most certainly did, it simply seems she didn't have quite enough evidence at that point but might have
@_karen1958 @TrialDiariesJ because the evidence was turned over...
@_karen1958 @TrialDiariesJ my take as well Karen. The inability to turn over evidence confuses me too.
@TrialDiariesJ oh I bet Juan's all over that. They fought the diagnosis then embraced it when it suited. Pff
@InconvenientTr1 @maryellenabc15 bcuz only reason donated was  4 self serving reasons they know. it She doesn't give a about hungry people.
@lucymcbath I'm so happy right now. God bless you.
@Justice4TravisA I'm so happy. Justice is finally complete.
#MichaelDunn guilty of first degree murder. The re-trial was worth it. Justice is finally complete.
@TrialDiariesJ verdict in Dunn trial!
@LeslieANjax YAY!!!!!!!!! No hung jury!
@WJXTHailey dernit!
@WildAboutTrial wow! Jodi should not be feeling too good right now! If not for WZ in the first trial she'd be on DR right now!
@TrialDiariesJ *not guilty.
@TrialDiariesJ if you think she's guilty, shouldn't be juror.
@TrialDiariesJ perfect candidate!
@RumpoleRT uh, not assuming anything. There's no evidence they committed a crime so why should I assume they did?
@RumpoleRT no kidding. Christ in a muffin.
@RumpoleRT what else would they do? Just sit there and get shot at?
@RumpoleRT lol! They didn't think they committed a crime!!!!! What are you saying???? All they knew was the drove away and came back
@RumpoleRT that's how people work.
@RumpoleRT they're operating with the  knowledge of how people behave. If they had anything to hide they would not have stayed.
@RumpoleRT they're operating In small window. They drove away to avoid gun fire them drove back when coast was clear.
@RumpoleRT they didn't think they needed to! What? The shooting happened at the gas station!
@RumpoleRT that cops should always assume young black kids are involved in drug deals and treat them as shady from the beginning.
@RumpoleRT they didn't assume. They went based on what witnesses told them. Talked to witnesses that night. What you're suggesting is that
@RumpoleRT not have found dunn. You're operating from a weird place where you think there was more to find.
@RumpoleRT yes they did. They just didn't have the info that day. Stop saying they didn't investigate. If they didn't investigate they would
@RumpoleRT all they knew was they needed to find the shooter and move from there. You're just finding excuses. You're not making sense.
@RumpoleRT again that's not how they operate. They don't investigate drug deal gone wrong unless they have info that's what it was.
@RumpoleRT arguing then dunn said what he said then went for his gun. That's what they knew.
@RumpoleRT nothing would ever get done. Too high a chance they're wasting time. No one saw a drug deal happening. They saw and heard them
@RumpoleRT that's not true. That's how they get solved. They dig around witnesses and statements. They can't just fabricate scenarios.
@RumpoleRT that's not what cops do. You're just making thingsup.
@RumpoleRT they had no reason to. It makes no sense. Drug dealers don't stick around to speak to cops. They don't investigate hypotheticals
@RumpoleRT they did though! They searched the car. Had no reason to search outside of car. None. Again, they can only invest. What they know
@RumpoleRT they proved their case that this was a murder. It all came together. You just don't want to see it.
@RumpoleRT state proved their case. That's what you don't get.
@RumpoleRT so why the hell would they be looking for a gun? It doesn't make sense.
@RumpoleRT cops can only invest. What they know. All they knew was the kids were shot at. No witnesses said they who back or anything.
@RumpoleRT so are you.
@RumpoleRT why?
@RumpoleRT not stick around to talk to police. They just don't.
@RumpoleRT but they didn't know theses kids needed investigating until Dunn's story. The perp was the one who fired and took off. Perps do
@RumpoleRT they didn't. We talked about this cops aren't psychic.
@RumpoleRT they didn't though.
@RumpoleRT lol...that's just stupid. Dunn's lies were proven. Everyone else just minor inconsistencies. You're reaching man.
@RumpoleRT why lie if you're innocent? No need to. Why run from cops if you're innocent? No need to.
@RumpoleRT LOL...oh ok. So it's not dunn lying it's Rhonda mistaken. That's too much assumption there, rump. Neigh also test. To Dunn lies
@RumpoleRT lol yes it is. Proof is a subjective thing. And you can use your own common sense. All signs point to Dunn lying. All of them.
@RumpoleRT but he is lying! He never told Rhonda he saw a gun but he's saying he did! Never told neigh. Something important to talk about!
@RumpoleRT juries are allowed to use their own common sense. Dunn's lies are the proof all I need.
@RumpoleRT they have.
@RumpoleRT yes but you seem to think the state has to definitely prove JD didn't have a gun...that's impossible, so they're using what they
@RumpoleRT that seems to be your fall back argument when nothing else works. Jury can use common sense to link parts.
@RumpoleRT and you have pretty high standards got proving something. State has proved a lot, including Dunn's lies.
@RumpoleRT you'd have to assume Dunn is telling the truth. He has reason to lie and he does lie. He chances his stories when it doesn't work
@RumpoleRT Dunn lies. A lot. And he says he couldn't open his own door. So that doesn't support Jordan being able to open it.
@RumpoleRT how can it shut if it's backing out? How could the bullets hit Jordan the way they did? More assumptions.
@RumpoleRT THE CARS WERE PARKED TO CLOSE. it's possible. But Jordan politely opening door in a murderous rage? Um no.
@RumpoleRT of course it does. Both rouer and Dunn say cars were parked too close. He couldn't open it far enough to get out w/o touching car
@RumpoleRT if door was open and they were backing out, it'd have damaged the car.
@RumpoleRT Dunn couldn't but Jordan could? No. Bullet traj shows it was closed because of the way the bullets hit Jordan. And
@RumpoleRT incorrect. It HAD to be.
@RumpoleRT also says cars parked too close couldn't even open door...but Jordan could?
@RumpoleRT no I'm not. It's the truth. All bullets hit Jordan while sitting and leaning away. For this to happen door has to be closed.
@RumpoleRT state proved Dunn lied. No reason to lie if you're innocent. He lied A LOT.
@RumpoleRT he clearly parked a bit farther back than the Durango. If door was open, the bullets could not have hit Jordan the way they did
@RumpoleRT lol, that's rich. You're assuming there was a gun even though one was never found. Now that is an assumption.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter bullet trajctories shows Dunn's version is impossible. This is forensic evidence. And now I'm done sorry Cathy. Lol
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter so they found the call. Point still stands. Cops aren't psychic.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter cops did investigate what are you talking about. Not looking for am imaginary gun they didn't know was there
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter again, not logical. If they had a gun they'd have fired it. It's common sense.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter leblancs came forward.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter how can cops know there are more witnesses if no one comes forward You're expecting them to be psychic. Leblancs
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter Guy never said that either. Besides the point. Witnesses never saw them hide anything.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter cops DID investigate. Spoke to witnesses, spoke to every1 they could. That's investigating.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter there were two witnesses who testified To what teens did at plaza and what they saw. The leblancs.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter never saw them leave car to bury a shot gun. Never saw them toss anything. Only saw two pass get out to check JD
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter the cops did not know this. Witnesses watched teens in plaza never saw them leave vicinity of car to hide anything
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter and if boys had gun why not shoot dunn first? Why not return fire? It's a ridiculous notion.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter would have known if Dunn had called cops/stayed on scene.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter how is it silly? All they knew was the boys were fired at. Searched boys car but had no rsn to search vicinity
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter but he didn't. Shows consciousness of guilt.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter cops did fine, can't look for something they didn't know they should be looking for. If Dunn had stayed diffrnt
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter innocence actions (staying,calling cops, giving story) vs. Guilt actions ( fleeing, never calling cops, chang story
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter "you're not gonna talk to me that way"
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter I def think SD disproved JD leaning away, no one else saw him get out of car, never saw him with weapon MD lied...
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter I'd vote M2 if it weren't for him getting out to continue shooting.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter but this mock jury voted M1. Sounds promising.
@RumpoleRT @courtchatter I know rumpole...but exactly, they do.
@courtchatter oh original vote and then came to M1. Promising. I think the pros got it right this time. Hoping  for m1 verdict as well.
@courtchatter @RumpoleRT this Is interesting hopefully will be same for real jurors and compromise of M2
@Tayllorred ok just wasn't sure if you saw it if you blocked her.
@Tayllorred you're welcome, just thought you should know so you aren't upset for no reason :)
@Tayllorred just so you know, that Julie woman wasn't talking to you, she was talking to Sandra.
@DaleCarsonLaw Michael Dunn verdict predictions?
@MissLove2Blog @TrialDiariesJ Jordan Davis told Tevin Thompson to turn it back up.
@DavidRHosking @LeslieANjax yes. She did in last trial too. He never mentioned it.
@LeslieANjax no, he said he opened door and was getting out of car. Still don't understand what the window would prove
@LeslieANjax thanks makes sense...but what will that prove? Dunn story is Jordan got out of car...
@LeslieANjax how does he know this?
@TrialDiariesJ lol! Such is the ruling...have fun in there
@Tayllorred lol of course it is, thank you for the follow too!
@TrialDiariesJ oh ok, cool but it wasn't closed a lot of reporters tweeted all the goings on if you're interested.
@TrialDiariesJ did you make it to the hearing today?
@TrialDiariesJ plus, it doesn't make sense. Why would the defense be calling Travis' old bishop?
@TrialDiariesJ I'm also certain he can't so that right? And if he did the DT would pitch a fit.
@TrialDiariesJ I'm fairly certain you're right Jen. The idea that's a DT witness only comes from conjecture. You were there.
@TrialDiariesJ Jen! There are some people saying he's a defense witness! I believe what you're saying so why are they saying this??? Which?
@WildAboutTrial *swerved
@WildAboutTrial Hmmm,  not surprised, but can't agree he did nothing wrong. He swerves into him.
7 white men, 3 white women, 1 African-American woman, 1 African-American man
#DunnTrial
@LeslieANjax what was hanania thinking?
@LeslieANjax bye juror #113
@TrialDiariesJ woohoo! Thanks!
@TrialDiariesJ hey Jen, will you be at the hearing today?
@TrialDiariesJ dunno! But what a twist!
@TrialDiariesJ Jeff Gold just tweeted he confirmed Jodi is out.
@jeffgoldesq @courtchatter that is Jodi's account it's the one she was tweeting on before she calculatingly turned it over
@RR_Wins @JodiAnnArias @cintyvoo a new attorney, I mean.
@RR_Wins @JodiAnnArias @cintyvoo the judge won't allow that.
@TrialDiariesJ @RR_Wins keep us posted! Probs Disappointed her little power plays to prevent state interviewing her witnesses didn't work
@Lindzo90 totes awky mo mo for sure
@TrialDiariesJ @DKaechler Same.
@juanlozano70 @TrialDiariesJ I expected this. Not enough evidence and even if he did...it's understandable....
@TrialDiariesJ I don't understand are they done for today or not?
@TrialDiariesJ would that be today?
@TrialDiariesJ this is kind of sad.
@TrialDiariesJ so...what is happening right now?
@TrialDiariesJ oh come on....they are in the home stretch! Come on!!!
@TrialDiariesJ also heard there was no gun residue on his hands. There's a pretty strong case for him.
@TrialDiariesJ @StabbysPencil like the syphilis.
@ismynightlife @StabbysPencil @TrialDiariesJ lol did the judge really tell nurmi that?
@TrialDiariesJ @KarenW1968 that's is surprising, wow. Let's hope that's true.
@TrialDiariesJ I figured as much. Better this way though...I thought the email was harmless but now the jury is left thinking it want.
@TrialDiariesJ took her long enough to figure out she needs to chop it off to sell the locks of love BS.
@TrialDiariesJ @karmicaaron it'll be death penalty. Not worried.
@TrialDiariesJ @karmicaaron the others will bring her back, I'm sure of it and remind her it's nonsense. He killed a young cop.
@TrialDiariesJ @ClubLove13 @audrey_m he's just a shill, claiming cop killers have a hard time in jail knowing that's untrue.
@TrialDiariesJ @CJMcCoy19 probably a pro-defense person.
@TrialDiariesJ I don't think it'll take the jury long to give this guy the death penalty. I honestly don't even think it's a possibility
@TrialDiariesJ he and the defense are trying to say life in prison will be punishment enough.
I'm entering eleventhgorgeous' Sephora Giveaway! #EGSephora @11thGorgeous 
@CharlduPlessc lol...finding this hard to believe...
@Justice4TravisA old news. Willmott has already come out denying Jodi is behind this. Seems to be a crazy Jodi lover is the one who filed it
@Shenson44 @TrialDivasJ I know! That's what they get! I don't know why they thought they could get away with it!
@TrialDivasJ @AskJuanMartinez this has been going on for a long time and I'm glad Juan has been onto them all along. Hopefully this ends

@JodiAriasNeedle @PuddyTat29 Abras on her body suggested damage from a blunt object or projectiles that lost the force to penetrate the skin
@JodiAriasNeedle @PuddyTat29 well look at this! You may be right needle! 
@RieMcAz @PuddyTat29 @karmicaaron state was forced to agree with defense
@RieMcAz @PuddyTat29 @karmicaaron state ballistics experts say he was on stumps. This is what oscar says but it doesn't discount murder.
@PuddyTat29 @RieMcAz @karmicaaron state says trajectory shows he was on stumps
@karmicaaron no info about trajectory pointing down. Look at bullet paths in door. Low and straight on.
@karmicaaron depends on where bullet entered she also could have fallen after first bullets, I think guilty but we need facts not spec.
@karmicaaron @craig_runner so does prosecution
@karmicaaron prosecution is now claiming he was on his stumps as well due to their own ballistics expert...
@JodiAriasNeedle @Mikkatiger the path said the bullets shattered her hip elbow skull Nothing about blunt injuries You can't just add details
@JodiAriasNeedle @Mikkatiger all wounds are consistent with bullet wounds. Y'all need to stop reporting non factual evidence.
@JodiAriasNeedle uh, no the bullet caused the shattered skull. Not a bat.
@JodiAriasNeedle @AlexCrawfordSky no, bullet. The bullet shattered the skull...the path. talked about that.
@JodiAriasNeedle she was not beat with a cricket bat. This was determined to be unfounded rumor.
@claireDoyleXX @AlexCrawfordSky he never mentioned anything about food, or snacks, and certainly not a bedtime movie they went to bed period
@AlexCrawfordSky it certainly is!
@kenneybaden sounds about right.
@nytimes that's crazy I thought he was already dead...
@CNN god 20 years? Time flies. I was 9 when it happened. But remember well
@MichaelSkolnik @tarakelley320 Duh!
@WJXTPulliam @Tpa_ismyhome what was their reaction to a. The ME and b. Ron Davis? Thankssomuch!
@WJXTPulliam I boys talking about a door locking func. on the car The doors cannot be unlocked from the back, only the driver can unlock
@NewsAndNom oh I see. Thanks so much.
@NewsAndNom can you tell us who made the final 12??? Thanks so much!
@WJXTPulliam @wjxt4 this is all very good for the state. Obv, it was dun who wanted to hightail it out of there...
@WJXTPulliam @wjxt4 omg, I can't wait to hear that!
@NewsAndNom Budge?
@WildAboutTrial will anyone be in the Michael Dunn courtroom?
@DrDrewHLN please never have obdeillah on. again what an idiot.
@Kelphotography @HagenAllison @TrialDivasS @FakeMarkOmara @TrialDivasJ they act like juan didn't freakin get her conv of 1 deg murder...
@Kelphotography @HagenAllison @TrialDivasS @FakeMarkOmara @TrialDivasJ i know they gloated on the hung jury on twitter. what they say?
@TrialDivasS @Kelphotography @FakeMarkOmara @TrialDivasJ LOL!!!!!!!!!!!
@TrialDivasS @davidwent12 you're welcome!
@TrialDivasS are you sure? It's still live on abc15.
@TrialDivasS @davidwent12 monica lindstrom said he may have done it private or the jury said it wouldn't have helped. it's call Allen charge
@TrialDivasS @Tthugz77 @TrialDivasJ @PicklesBottom @WildAboutTrial so jelly. the have the best french fries ever.
@TrialDivasJ thanks that's what i was asking
@KDLarson1125 @DerrickSlone @TrialDivasS just hope the don't shoot to kill....
@hansburnett @TrialDivasS "victim?" he is the victim. he was murdered.
@TrialDivasJ so confused i thought there was a hearing re: mistrials motions and who juan was going to call and such.
@TrialDivasJ is the hearing still going on?
@TrialDivasJ bet the judge will grant motion to continue. sigh
@TrialDivasJ aw man
@TrialDivasJ @DerrickSlone definitely very hard to get a convic against a cop. not many pros could have got what juan got i think
@TrialDivasS whoohoo!
@monicalindstrom what does this mean?
@monicalindstrom @scottpasmoretv maybe they though he esc situation but dog and dan were threat and he didnt mean to kill
@martinezliss @12News This is much better than what i thought would happen!
@monicalindstrom i cant imagine how it must feel knowing the man who killed your son will probably walk out of court today...
@kenneybaden it's terrible :(
@monicalindstrom thank you!
@TrialDivasJ hmmmm maybe
@monicalindstrom @KTAR923 why didn't the judge give the Allen Charge?
@monicalindstrom @TrialDivasJ yes
@croakerqueen I think it's hung on murder and assault and guilty of animal cruelty. How could he be guilty of one of the first two counts ?
@TrialDivasJ your intitial tweet was confusing it made it sound like verdict on count 1 hung on count 2
@TrialDivasJ sounds like hung jury on assault and murder. better than acquittal but still disappointing
@TrialDivasS hung jury. better than acquittal though
@IamBill46 What does this mean?
@TrialDivasJ @Catlvr27 I hear he's different than his courtroom persona. Very sweet and nice.
@WildAboutTrial Eh, I don't really know...I think Equusearch does for theirs though.
@TrialDivasS what's going on over there? Is there jury in yet or what???
Reply to @courtjesterias Just dont read OHLN anymore the guy is an idiot who has no idea what hes talking about. hes just in love with JA
@monicalindstrom but juan will fix it...
@BilWwalter1221 @blkhwx10 @JodiDemise Jodi's supporters have threatened Travis's family as well. They had to be escorted out of court.
@JodisDiary @AlyceLaViolette Well, that's what happens when you lie for a murderer and slander a dead man. People tend to hate you...
@anthxeria Yes, 5 years house arrest for premeditated murder. Nailed it...
@WildAboutTrial Well, that's just what you get, isn't it?
@WildAboutTrial ..........
@KatieWickUSA Keep us posted!
I felt as embarrased for @MileyCyrus as I do for that drunk at the party trying a little too hard to be the hottest one in the room...
@rstansbu Hemy hasn't said anything.
@rstansbu You mean like Elizabeth, who initally said she was told Andrea found out at the hospital, then changed her story and said the dc?
@rstansbu And what about the text?
@rstansbu would you really forget a call like that if it were your child??? I wouldn't.
@rstansbu Anyone can put on a front, It means nothing. We already know Andrea is quite the actress.
@CarlTOUGHJames Came across your story online. You're an inspiration! If you can do it I know I can!
@WildAboutTrial what about the defense motion? did she rule on that???
@WildAboutTrial thanks for being there wild!!! you rock!
@WildAboutTrial @Justice_Caylee so you're good.
@WildAboutTrial Its typical to wear them on the opposite hand that you write with so it doesnt get in the way but pretty sure JM's  arighty
@WildAboutTrial take pictures!
@stark3923 they've already said they're moving forward with a new dp trial and no signs thety've changed their minds. they're going for it
@WildAboutTrial verdict reached
@GittleBos @choley they will be shut down.
@GittleBos @choley @EWErickson You think this bill isn't going to kill and harm women and babies more than helps? the ignorant walk among us
@EWErickson I'm sure God is so proud of you Erick...you're a disgrace
@becca_martie no one likes you
@tarakelley320 @T_S_Jackson @LollyTosh @WildAboutTrial I don't think she did either. Something hinky about office for sure...
@tarakelley320 @sandrareat @Kath_n_NY every single picture. it was creepy
@tarakelley320 coulnd't break it off with Jodi i mean? and he couldn't live wiht himself if he did break up with her and she did kill hersel
@tarakelley320 did you hear sky hughes' story of how travis told her he coudn't break it off with her because she threatened to kill herself
@tarakelley320 HEY! I was wondering if you have learned yet about forged letters jodi tried to admit where t.a. "admits" to being a pedo???
I wonder if #WilliamZervakos knows that #JodiArias forged letters in her cell that she claimed were written by Travis saying he was a pedo?
@WildAboutTrial wild, how will the ever find a new set of 18 people who have not already made up their mind about Jodi? this is awful
@WildAboutTrial :'(
@WildAboutTrial @Demilaf chris williams also reported this
@WildAboutTrial do they look upset?
@WildAboutTrial Screw you...p
@katiecoolady it just doesn't make sense that this jury would decide after such a short delib. that they were hung!
@katiecoolady kathy I also after seeing the question think the jury just wanted an instruction clarified and the judge misinterpreted it
@WildAboutTrial I hear it's officially a hung jury? True?
@CamilleKimball why is willmott allowed to say jodi can't be paroled when she can if she gets lwp??? That's blatantly false info
@WildAboutTrial was Juan able to clarify she could possible get life with parole possibility? Willmott is giving untrue facts
@Jodiannarias did you wanna shoot him in the face and slash his throat because he doesn't believe your BS?
@PawelNYC @AshleyMCulbreth yeah care to enlighten us exactly what they have misrepresenting? arias courts media. the circus is her doing
@monicalindstrom @tbrandy100 @NOlabelsmom I do agree Willmott is a better speaker and argues the law better...but it won't be enough.
@ABC your interview with #JodiArias was inspired your Ryan Owens kicks ass.
@WildAboutTrial Well that is quite the 180. From arguing with demarte to using the diagnosis as a mitigating factor. Makes little sense.
@CamilleKimball good grief...poor little Jodi getting grounded...poor little DV victim...*eyeroll*
@CamilleKimball Last paragraph awesome. She truly cannot understand how human beings work.
@CamilleKimball can you tell us a little more about the motion the DT filed this morn with the state? thanks!!!
@katiecoolady @PattiJ653 eyeroll...
@WildAboutTrial The DT filed a stay with the state court. It was DENIED. We should start today.
@troyhaydenfox10 Is it possible the state court was able to rule quicly?
@WildAboutTrial @AnneElizabeth65 My husband is from Montreal.
@WildAboutTrial Knoot's good people.
@InconvenientTr1 @michaelbkiefer You have no idea what you are talking about and the lies Keifer has spread.
@InconvenientTr1 @michaelbkiefer I think anyone who supports Jodi after the murder she planned and executed must have thought process probs
@MarkEiglarsh what are the odds of it working, like, decades down the road? Thanks mark.
@michaelbkiefer Sounds like a ploy. Patti has herself quite a rap sheet. Probably has more to do with that than "death threats"... GMADB
@Miss_Sara_10 @luckenbooth5 I have been abused. No way Jodi was. She lived in CA for Christ's sake. Overwhelming premed evidence negates it
@Jodiannarias You mean the ones you traced from Dior and Guess ads? Great!
@katiecoolady @Skabootch shine on even when faced with his own family member's murder? I don't understand...
@katiecoolady @Skabootch Has this reporter no sympathy at all? How would he feel if it were his family? Would his self righteousness cont
@michaelbkiefer If you think your bias toward her is not apparent then youre fooling yourself Someone like you does not belong in journalism
@michaelbkiefer @dikell3 Is Juan not allowed to object to things???
@michaelbkiefer Why are you obsessed with Jodi? Seriously, what is so attractive about a cold blooded murderer?
@InconvenientTr1 @J_B_Miller @michaelbkiefer I'd provide examples but twitter is not the proper forum.
@InconvenientTr1 @J_B_Miller @michaelbkiefer I can tell you this is decidedly not true. He writes his own "facts" as facts.
@PitchforksPosts @J_B_Miller @michaelbkiefer That is remarkably innaccurate.
@michaelbkiefer @chrisbr40 No. The judge ruled that regardless of the order the MURDER was still extremely cruel.
@copilot_53 @MarkEiglarsh Especially since she said it on the day we hear just the extent of the pain T suffered as he was dying the nerve.
@WildAboutTrial They did. They will be back.
@ariastrialwatch @Carli379 I think that all 12 found premeditation means they believe she brought the gun and planned to kill him. Damning.
@Carli379 @markgeragos Not necessarily Juan also said the second she started stabbing him she was unwelcome and that also made it a felony.
@markgeragos Clerk said, "5 jurors found premeditated murder, 0 found felony murder, and 7 found both premeditated and felony murder."
@markgeragos Yes it is. You might want to listen to the clerk read it again buddy. I'm not even an attorney and I figured it out.
@markgeragos Just so you know it was not a 7-5 split. It was unanimous premeditated with 7 finding both premeditation and felony murder.
@Lilli42161 @MarkEiglarsh @sakotheAmerican Au contraire, he thought she was guilty as hell IIRC!!!
@MarkEiglarsh @DrDrewHLN @drdrew You were right though Mark. 100% This is Jodi's last hurrah.
@WildAboutTrial Uh duh! Because that would show she already had the gun with her! She needs the gun to be Travis' and not readily available!
@KatieWickUSA how did the jury react Katie? Was the gunshot pic where you can see his whole face? Thanks
@WildaboutTrial2 @mandy_hearts @TamaraTattles ok juror 8 is not cup toucher then. 8 is older with a beard or goattee.
@WildaboutTrial2 @Lalaej agree on in and out fries. Five Guys has he best fries ever.
@WildAboutTrial it's a good question. Means jodi would know the rules. Wasn't led astray by Travis.
@WildAboutTrial @azmatthews @tani010668 @TorontoBlonde is hWhill hWheaton there today?
@ediesteen @heydollkelly @michaelbkiefer @katiecoolady but how would they know whether it was Travis ' or GF's?
@johnhorn71 @CandiBates81 @WildAboutTrial but the state never said she was holding a knife when she took this photo.
@WildAboutTrial that's rich. Juan should ask the same question of the whole thing.
@WildAboutTrial @courtjesterias can you also follow @travisalexander for solidarity?
Everyone please follow @travisalexander on twitter.
@WildAboutTrial Yes Bianca and Matt. Bianca was his new girlfriend that Jodi drove to confront.
@WildAboutTrial Funny...
@WildAboutTrial I disagree completely. There's a reason for this. He's already made some excellent points today. So I don't care.
@KatieWickUSA @mmonroe2nd If you don't mind, what was the reaction to the dwarves comment? She got very testy VERY early!
@KatieWickUSA I wish Dr Drew's weird sit-in would have asked you about the jury and your observations. Even Eiglarsh was like, that's it? ha
@KatieWickUSA Oh my God Katie...they asked you about Jodi's hair and...that's it. #Floored.
@WildAboutTrial Please, sweet Lord!
@WildAboutTrial Is this juror a young man who sits in the front row? TIA
@KatieWickUSA How did the jurors react to the testimony of ALV about the emails toward the end of the day?
@answerback1 @jvelezmitchell Except Travis never abused her. She's a sociopath.
@ann1lee @jvelezmitchell She was not in danger. He never abused her or attacked her.
@WildAboutTrial Sounds an awful lot like Travis
@KatieWickUSA @DrDrewHLN Can't wait! I assume this was re: the cover up vs. alternate reality question?
@WildAboutTrial A court observer said LaVi is there today she should be up today.
@WildAboutTrial How's the jury look? Is Juan being effective or is he losing them?
@WildAboutTrial I know I should feel bad for that lady...but come on!
@WildAboutTrial Sounds like they are just altogether done with this clown then...
@WildAboutTrial So does the jury seem bored with Juan today? Or was it just toward the end? Do they seem more attentive to Wilmott #worried
@waynebrady @colinmochrie I think I am going to cry...all my dreams are coming true.
@MeeBee23 @JoeyJacksonEsq NM! I just realized this was still the defense's case!
@HLNTV Apparently not. The jury doesn't seem to mind.
@MeeBee23 @jvelezmitchell allow Hall to explain it.
@jvelezmitchell I hope Dave Hall doesn't come to regret making this video public. Sly of  the defense to want the video to come in but not
@MeeBee23 @JoeyJacksonEsq I have another question: does the defense get a subrebuttal? I hear talk about how they can call witnesses again.
@JoeyJacksonEsq Can the prosecution use the forged letters as evidence that the pedophilia thing is most likey bs? Thanks! Big fan!
