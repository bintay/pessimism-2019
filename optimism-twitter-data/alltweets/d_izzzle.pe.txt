@buffalewis or paying for their junk food and useless shit groceries while texting on their iPhone
@marcotwentysix great fans that's for sure, they were fun to watch. I wish you guys luck in the future. I like to watch Canada teams do well
@marcotwentysix that tweet would actually sting if your jets weren't a waste of a playoff berth this year
So am I supposed to post a picture of my mom or something? Like everyone else?
@BostonHateParty there's only one stand up that I actually laughed at, other than that I can agree with you and fuck piers morgan
@BostonHateParty so much hate.. Do you have another twitter that talks about stuff you like?
@ataway23 well I'm completely honored to be your first tweet <OK HAND SIGN>
@ChristianAllen1 why must they torture fans like that? #Rude
Planning a possible trip to see the Bills play in KC in Nov along with a home game in Sept. Hoping everything goes as planned <THUMBS UP SIGN> #Excited
Hahah love this.. I'm cracking up over here 
@ryanjosephv sending this number to my stalkers...

@M_Stark11 lolllll you're silly
@Thegetawayplan9 I'm sorry, I'll be sure to include you now. You need to snap me more as well <THUMBS UP SIGN>
If you ever want to feel loved, snap a pic of you in the ER waiting room. #Working #ThanksGuys #Bored
@JWRaidersLakers my wine that I CAN'T even drink yet because I got called BACK into work. Currently in the ER with a patient <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Sometimes I wonder why I still snap people I don't even like. What am I doing? <FLUSHED FACE>
When you grab a bottle of wine after coming in to work for a few hours to help out, only to realize they need you back again.. FML
Wow, I'm such a team player. Woke up from my nap to head back into work today because understaffed at the moment. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@LAKingsIceCrew @BeckySattero is the best! #Becky #FaceoffFriday
@HockeyGods this is so good I can't even hate
Still awake and have work at 7am.. Well that sucks
Wow, don't remember the last time I heard a downpour like that outside. Keep it up with the rain, Cali! <UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>️
@halobruin lol <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@NHL nobody cares.GO TO BED
I'm literally searching my entire room for this texting noise and I realize it's my iPad connected to my iPhone. JEEZ, I NEED SLEEP <SKULL>

@TiFighter12 
@sammmie_wammmie @Drunk_Kane88 lol
@M_Stark11 yeah, I'm all for the flames winning, you know this
@M_Stark11 I WAS JUST TWEETING THAT BECAUSE OF A TWEET I SAW about a kings fan rooting for ducks. Sorry, cranky at work. But yeah
@77DoubleJ don't get all sensitive on me now. Still holding out hope for the flames. I was just saying that because a previous tweet
@RonWaxman I agree. It was more so about a tweet I previously replied to that a kings fan would root ducks over hawks. But thanks
@RonWaxman no need for the sarcasm!
@TTTinSD I agree, but to choose one... Ducks is NEVER I MEAN NEVER.
@DravenIM wasn't talking about you :)  promise
@DHBucsFan I mean, by the looks of it... But by all means, I hope Calgary wins it
Wait, Kings fans are actually choosing Ducks over Hawks to root for in the WCF? What is wrong with you??
@ChristianAllen1 @dightkwing yep, fuck that shit. No way in hell
Say no to being "friends" with Blackhawks fans.. #ANNOYINGAF 
@dmcintyre1991 I guess all Blackhawks fans think it's always about them, eh
Sighhhh too tired to deal with Blackhawks fans. Yawwnnnnn #OverIt
Hahah my coworker just fell asleep on me. She's snoring.. How funny. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@_talkhockeytome I'll be looking forward to that one! Hopefully I can catch some of it at work
So... What the hell happened to Tampa tonight? That 4th win is always the hardest, that's for sure.
Current obsession with this song 


@jctheshow haha yeah I'm going right now. I can't take it!!!!
@jctheshow I have a manufacture warranty but not insurance to cover stuff like this. Either way 70 is doable for my STUPIDITY
@jctheshow I found a place for $70 which seems about right. At least the LCD part isn't broken so it's just the glass?
Cool. Shattered my iPhone screen for the first time. This sucks <ANGRY FACE> that's 100 bucks right there..
Hahaha this cat is such a trouble maker... 
YES! Loving this 3-1 series lead the Caps have against the Rags. <THUMBS UP SIGN> #StanleyCupPlayoffs

I always find awesome books at thrift stores. Simple things like this just make your day! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> 
@bloom1123 @ChristianAllen1 can I have your autograph
#netflix parascope shouted me out with this when I said I was currently watching #ItsAlwaysSunny (got my @ wrong <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>) 
@mzvelo74 high emotions this time of year.. I get defensive about Blackhawks "fans," you feel me
@mzvelo74 oh don't try and turn this around, bud
@mzvelo74 pretty sure you're just too busy watching your amazing hawks
Granted the score is only 1-0, but this is an amazing game. Go Caps #StanleyCupPlayoffs
@gardeniasnjazz yes! Makes it so much easier and not so much like you're working
In exception of one person, I fricken love my coworkers at my new job. I swear it makes it or breaks it when working. I missed having them
@77DoubleJ crazy to think ducks are 6-0 right now. Hoping Flames finally break the losing streak against them
@77DoubleJ have a safe flight home. Sorry you weren't able to catch a road win on your trip. Difficult series <FIRE>'s are facing, unfortunately
@marcotwentysix lol definitely not. Before my time, unfortunately

@M_Stark11 yeah, I decided to give in at work tonight and it was a great one. Try it
I had Nutella for the first time tonight. I now know what all the hype is about... It is so good
@mzvelo74 well then, this just got a little weird! I don't remember this happening. Hmm, 2013? Nope
@mzvelo74 woah, things are getting personal over here, Manny
@dmcintyre1991 k well have fun with that
@dmcintyre1991 oh now you want to talk? Interesting
@mzvelo74 can't do this right now, Manuel. I just can't
How I feel about Hawks fans 
@pucktacular @zachzold_rk trying way too hard to repeat 2012 playoffs 
@mzvelo74 I think you should just move to Chicago and maybe stay there. Forever. Don't come back.
@mzvelo74 not sure what to believe anymore...
@mzvelo74 well thank you, I'm not sure what to say right now. Hard to believe a hawks fan though..
@mzvelo74 to rub it in my face that the evil of them all has won their game? OKAY THEN
@mzvelo74 #FunFact - NOBODY CARES
You're kind of an asshole if you scare people who have their headphones in. <UNAMUSED FACE>
I keep telling foreign people on periscope I want to sit on their face and they get so confused. I'm having a blast, clearly
One of those nights where you want to go out but don't feel like getting ready <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@Dodgers @yungjoc650 what a stud. Go Dodgers!!
@Kingsmariee stubbornness at it's finest. I'm very classy, thank you very much <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@Kingsmariee You should probably go back to Baileys twitter page and check out your ducks "friend" who was talking shit for "no reason"
@Kingsmariee you have nothing to do with this convo so maybe go about whatever you were doing and keep it that way? Good idea.
@Kingsmariee @salaisesOFpizza @CassieJeanne_ HAHAH hypocrites much? Jeez.
@salaisesOFpizza @CassieJeanne_ oh wow you guys sound like the nerd table in the cafeteria. Where people throw food because nobody likes you
@salaisesOFpizza just one section of fans at staples center is more passionate than whatever OC trash washes up at a game at the Pond
@salaisesOFpizza who the heck tells you this stuff? Lol go to a game and see for yourself. NEVER happens.
@Ducksxfan93 at least us "bandwagon fans" can fill up out our own stadium without begging people to go.Should prob worry about your own fans
@BaileyLAKings GO FLAMES!
@77DoubleJ you sure you weren't just seeing double vision when you were blasted last night? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@TotalRamsMove @NFLonFOX YES WINNING SO HARD WITH THAT GIF
^^^ This is so perfect for this second round of #StanleyCupPlayoffs #ANAvsCGY
@ArreolaSport no way! That is quite funny.. Tickets were as low as 27 dollars last night
Lol! Even the news station called out the empty Pond last night! 
@thatgoalie13 no!! Okay, I need to get on that ASAP.
@thatgoalie13 heheheh. Used for beer bongs only.
@thatgoalie13 well you need about a pack to even feel something anyways. So in reality that's enough for a small gathering
@thatgoalie13 Lmaoo you're still going on about this. No; this was not my party, I'm not 16. I would invite you though.
@TimCielinski alright, whose the guy to suggest that. Let's get him

I can’t believe the Flames fans left so early.
THE FLAMES COMEBACK HAS COMMENCED ... Haha who am I kidding.
@77DoubleJ I will see if I will be going down to ANA sometime tom. That's the only time I'm available so I will let you know if possible
@77DoubleJ unfortunately working a swing shift that day as well. Would have really loved to meet you and your crew though <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@77DoubleJ if I wasn't at work tonight I would be at the game, seriously. Might as well fill in some of the many empty seats
@77DoubleJ hopefully they turn it around, us kings fans are rooting with you!!
You know you're bored when you're texting your coworker in the same room for fun. Seriously.. So... Dead...
@77DoubleJ good looking crew, good luck! Go flames
OH HELL YEAH!!!!!! Good guys won #StanleyCupPlayoffs
@Lhultin @bloom1123 from what I hear they did last round when puck was dropped.. Not sure how accurate that is but believable
@bloom1123 embarrassing @77DoubleJ
Pull up to the party like "where is @thatgoalie13 ??" 
Really not looking forward to my 12:30-11:30 shift today. Laaaaame. I'm such a great employee for coming in early though <INFORMATION DESK PERSON> #TakeNotes
@Cmamom76Erin I know, right? What a psycho

@77DoubleJ yeah, I have no doubt you've been around here before. Quite the traveler <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@77DoubleJ wow, crazy. That's how warm it's expected to be here as well. You'll be right at home then, even with the run down arena  ;)
@77DoubleJ cool! I hope that works out for you guys. Be sure to leave the parka jackets at home <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@BaileyLAKings @tonykidm @AnaheimDucks Must be a ducks fan trolling the kings. Please be...
@77DoubleJ I've been rooting for the flames all along. You going to ANA to see a game/flight that's cheaper than a seat in Calgary?
I wonder if second round playoff tickets at the Honda Center will be more than 25 dollars.. Go Flames!
@77DoubleJ looks like it was.. I'm at work and wasn't able to watch, unfortunately. Beat the Ducks!
But then Vancouver lost an…
@77DoubleJ congrats #WeAreAllFlames <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>

Wow, I just woke up.. and the scary thing is I could keep sleeping if I wanted to. But I have to get ready for work :/
@NHL BLOCKING YOU
Let's get drunk and make friends
This whole convo is amazing. Best one yet..  
@EngellandsEye penguins put up a great fight against the best team in the league. Very proud
@YesItsColin I feel so ashamed that I never watched it while it was on television.. Thank you #Netflix
@penguins WE DONT CARE AT THIS POINT... Let it go, plz <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@YesItsColin YES YES YES just watched this like yesterday. I'm addicted to Sunny at the moment
@BostonHateParty I wish I made money off shitty vines too
@BDeegs @BostonHateParty you guys better be careful, you might get twitter blocked!
@mzvelo74 I think I'll be okay not knowing what awful vines she posts.
@BostonHateParty I probably said something along the lines of that a longgggg time ago.
YOUR VINES ARENT EVEN FUNNY
HAHAHA what did I do?! Sensitive people, maaaannnn <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #blocked 
@77DoubleJ I feel like it would make more sense for me to be a.. Flyers fan.. Considering the Kings roster history. But.. *shivers*
@77DoubleJ oh yeah.. Those two teams shouldn't even be in the same sentence together it's just wrong
wait, there's people out there who actually like the Rangers AND the Penguins... WHAT IN THE. Are you dumb
@J_HUFFman24 it was a very close series.Ppl bragging about how they knew it would be over in 5 are dumb. They were sweating the whole series
Please, tell us more how you predicted one playoff series the correct number of games. I HAVENT SEEN ENOUGH OF THEM YET
@DirtyHarry0 oh yeah that's right. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@DirtyHarry0 I was hoping I could find something to use on my iPad.. I forget what site I used to stream games last season
@TimCielinski NOT A GOOD TIME TO PICK A FIGHT TIMMY
Alright, moving on.. Where can I stream the Dodgers game online? #INeedMyDodgers

@nfl @AZCardinals hahaha I can dig it

This year, Heath Evans picked EVERY Bills game: 
@k20Hudson I love you and every other Jets fan at the game tonight. Great fan base. You had most of Cali rooting with you tonight<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@77DoubleJ yes that's how it works
@77DoubleJ I take that back now
@77DoubleJ what would I do without you.. Just made life so much easier. Now I'll never be without Sunny in Philadelphia
@77DoubleJ wow, just downloaded it. That's sweet. The scrolling feature will take a little time to get used to but I'll be using it for sure
@77DoubleJ that is brilliant - thanks
@mzvelo74 mine was hiding in my pillow sheet.. I have Velcro to stick it on my bedpost but of course I forget
Why does the Apple TV remote have to be so damn small.. It's capable of hiding anywhere
@mzvelo74 too much cuteness in one photo.. Too much to handle <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@RedskinFanInCal @HeathEvans44 @NFLTotalAccess because #BillsMafia hasn't been around since 2015? Riiiiight <UNAMUSED FACE>

@thatgoalie13 I'm offended, thanks <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@thatgoalie13 I drive a mini van to take my clients places and I hate it more than anything. Look like a soccer mom, oh and it's bright red
It doesn't matter how many kids I plan on having, but I'll never resort to getting a mini van <SLEEPY FACE>
@darrenrovell I wouldn't even feed that to my dog
@MJFrizzle I started work at 7 this morning so I know now they're feeling!
@dmcintyre1991 GO TO BED 
@77DoubleJ there's some things we can admit we're not proud of.. I know. They're great reasons though if that helps.
@77DoubleJ I'll always have a soft spot for that team for a few reasons, but my western team to root for is the Flames #HappyMedium
@77DoubleJ I like any team that's able to beat the Blackhawks, the evil of them all..
@77DoubleJ it really is, man I can't stand Chicago. Really would have loved to see NSH take the win there after that epic game.
@77DoubleJ well that sucks. Good luck to Nashville for getting out of this.. Now I guess it's time to go to bed sad.
@77DoubleJ I can do free hockey - I'm a fan. But right now I want to <SLEEPING FACE> but I won't. How are you doing over there, old man? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@77DoubleJ did you beat up any Canucks fans? Seems to be happening a lot this series
@77DoubleJ seriously! I don't think I've accumulated as much adrenaline in my lifetime compared to tonight's game. Impressive
I'm getting really tired and I'm not even in Chicago/Nashville watching this game #BecauseItsTheCup
@77DoubleJ yeah, so much hate between the two! Very intense.. Calgary is definitely the stronger team. And yeah, can't go 3-1 back to NSH
@77DoubleJ yeah, I watched the first two periods of tonight's game.. This Nashville/Chicago is my favorite series though
Me right now: 
I mean, I can get why someone can think I'm not 22 when ordering booze, but 15??! Okay...
@BillsExpert my friend and I wanted to go to BUF to see the cowboys but since it's in December we're like NO WAY, TOO COLD.
@ZaneBancroft4 yep!! We decided on week 2 <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@TCaddy6 loser/winner pays for my flight to buffalo. Sounds fair. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@ZaneBancroft4 I wish! Would love to go to home opener but my friend and I really want to see the Pats play there #Decisions
@TCaddy6 NFL schedule just got released and you're already throwing money down.. Calm down little boy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@TCaddy6 that will be very embarrassing if he's the starter and he  kicks ass! I'll save this tweet to shove it in your face after the game
Debating Week 1 against the Colts or Week 2 against the Pats at the Ralph.. Either one should be good. I'm SO EXCITED <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><AMERICAN FOOTBALL> #BillsMafia
@pucktacular what an interesting game that should be <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@TCaddy6 haha what a game that will be! The Ralph will be CRAZY! Hope your boys are ready <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>

LET'S. GO. BUFFALO.

Ohhhh my that was so damn intense... #Penguins <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
GO PENGUINS! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #StanleyCupPlayoffs
@HockeyInHeelsTV  totally reminds me of this 
To my Buffalonian followers: what's the best way to get to Toronto since rental cars aren't allowed over the border? #BillsMafia
@Steph_Sampson someone has some time on their hands, eh
@Steph_Sampson but where's the coachella Ferris wheel?
NFL schedule is going to finally be released tomorrow. This makes me very excited considering I'll be going to Buffalo to see a game. Woo <PARTY POPPER>
@M_Stark11 FROZEN FURY!!!
@M_Stark11 haha yeah my sister is going to stagecoach and I'm hearing about it allllll the time. Wish I could go to that one though
Oh my God I'm so sick of seeing all these Coachella pictures...
Lol nice typo... Go blues #StanleyCupPlayoffs 
@44Chavito Hahha I work in a drug rehab/eating disorder facility. Some of the clients get really bored
@himynameisaldo 40 degrees? Wow, I don't remember the last time I felt that here in Cali... What??
@himynameisaldo I do not approve but that's pretty cool
Wasn't even joking 
The clients are turning my coworker into Kim Jung Un for a SOME reason. Makeup, hair and anything North Korean. What the heck #RandomDay
Locked out of work at the moment, bummmerrrrrr.
@DravenIM kings fan? Not anymore! They didn't make the playoffs, I'm onto a new team duhhhh
Dear Chicago fans: goals don't count after the whistle has been blown. Quit booing, thanks
@ChirpTheDusters no wonder he gets paid the big bucks for his amazing hockey analysis
@77DoubleJ yeah, doesn't get much more stressful than that.
@ChirpTheDusters who would have thought that's how overtime hockey works
I like playoff overtime hockey.. When it's not my team.

@Steph_Sampson lol I posted this last night. Dead. 
There's so many hilarious pictures about Jarret Stoll and cocaine... Wow
@weather7022 I like the penguins, and plus, I would root for anyone playing the rangers anyways
Penguins - KEEP IT UP... I like it #StanleyCupPlayoffs
@TimCielinski hahah I don't even care. I can enjoy these playoffs without having extreme panic attacks which is nice
@TimCielinski yep, but we're not in the playoffs this season to apparently the bandwagon is falling off? So I hear...
@TimCielinski hahah did you see my tweet last night? that's the response I got after snapchatting this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
New #LAKings jersey.. Jeff Carter <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> 
@dmcintyre1991 figures Blackhawks fans don't know anything about other teams in the NHL, because they're too busy sucking off their own team
@dmcintyre1991 I would be offended right now if it weren't for the fact you named your dog after our mascot <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@dmcintyre1991 sending me garbage? I thought we were friends?
@dmcintyre1991 I'll have a virtual drink with you just because I'll be stuck hearing about Blackhawks all off season <SLEEPY FACE>
@dmcintyre1991 okay, you know I'll be your shoulder to cry on though. Just going to put that out there
@dmcintyre1991 yeah.. Would be quite the shame to be knocked out first round though <SMIRKING FACE>
@dmcintyre1991 hahah!!! You remembered! Yeah, I feed off of Chicago fans disappointment when they lose..
@dmcintyre1991 that's funny.. Get your shit together, Crawford!
@TheHockeyChat @dmcintyre1991 heheheh


@ChristianAllen1 could be worse, could be Taylor swift

The struggle when you really want to eat your lunch but you have to find something on tv to watch first. #firstworldproblems
@himynameisaldo nope. Thousand Oaks. Wildwood hiking trail
@ChristianAllen1 ahhhh the good life <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@ChristianAllen1 I will let you know sometime tomorrow afternoon..

@mzvelo74 you would love my birthday gift darn it!!
@mzvelo74 lmaooo I wonder if he's still doing that! Thanks for the funny flashback :)
@ChristianAllen1 yep... Fuzzy <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@ChristianAllen1 believe it or not, that night was a little fuzzy. Kings elimination day too #SadTimes
@ChristianAllen1 in my wonderful city of a Thousand Oaks <WINKING FACE> check out my snapchat
Went on a hike after work and it was so amazing!!! Perfect Cali weather <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️ 
@Duke27_ that is siiiick.. Come pick me up
Working a 7am-11am shift is so damn pointless, seriously
OMG a client at work keeps playing reruns of the Wendy show and I'm about to snap... <POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE><POUTING FACE> something else must be on TV
If there was a way where I could listen to Spotify Radio without a Kanye West song playing, that would be great
@Steph_Sampson yeah, me too.. I woke up randomly. I'm heading back to sleep though
@Steph_Sampson lay off the weed, Stephanie!
When the favorite person you've been talking to goes to bed &lt;&lt;&lt; <POUTING FACE>
I'm so flippin obsessed with this song #kendricklamar #nowplaying 
@WerewolfAndros @EHClothing kissing the Stanley Cup was probably one of my favorite moments in life #NotExaggerating
@Steph_Sampson yes this is a subtweet meant for you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
The Penguins are in the playoffs!!! Best of luck to them playing the Rangers, yikes. <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #StanleyCupPlayoffs
I don't remember having someone to talk to who can make me feel all warm inside and always smiling. I missed it. It's such a good feeling.
@steelpengos42 Detroit has no effect on the penguins
@steelpengos42 
@teamlastore seriously? I just spent 200 bucks on stuff and you don't offer free shipping? Kind of a disappointment.
@teamlastore the perks of not being in the playoffs I guess...
@ChristianAllen1 woooo hoo! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@ChristianAllen1 okay, you'll ride with me right? How long does it take?
@ChristianAllen1 okay, well I want to take the train too but I'll just ride home after and try not to get lost
@ChristianAllen1 @M_Stark11 okay I'm able to make the Friday game on the 24th as of right now !! Can we do that??
@M_Stark11 yeah I must have missed that when looking at the schedule. Whoops, I thought I was later in the season
@M_Stark11 why would it jeopardize FF?
@ChristianAllen1 really?? well I'm wrong lol I still want to do it though
@M_Stark11 I believe it's not till September
@M_Stark11 yeah definitely, I'd probably be down for that, Christian and I talked about taking the train to SD for a game you should join
@M_Stark11 that drive does NOT appeal to me right now though lol
@AlexMorgan_33 lol!! Good one, I now know who I'm rooting for this post season - anyone who plays Tampa
@AlexMorgan_33 you're right, I probably should.. Let me go rummage through the trash to find some #lol
@AlexMorgan_33 grow a pair, Alex!!! You have your "lucky lightening socks" to wear too..
@AlexMorgan_33 sigh.. I thought what we had last night was special. You are a cruel human being.
@AlexMorgan_33 I'd rather root for a team that won't get swept the first round <WINKING FACE>
Penguins.. Please win. You're all I have left..
This giraffe birth is SO COOL!!
@M_Stark11 oh I know this! :)
Can't even eat lunch at work without being reminded.... #LAKings 
@ChristianAllen1 ummm yes.. If you can splurge on 35 bucks we should totally sit in RF. They're giving away a Yoda shirt!
@ChristianAllen1 ITS STAR WARS NIGHT TOO! I'm so excited
@ChristianAllen1 you want to go Tuesday with me? Im off. I want to get one of my baseballs signed at the bullpen
@ChristianAllen1 okay, I said I was off next Friday so if it's for sure I'll get us tickets for your birthday
@ChristianAllen1 I texted you about friday! Is it not working??
@ChristianAllen1 @M_Stark11
I want to go to the @Dodgers game Tuesday..
Going to stay off Facebook today, only because I know there will be posts about the Kings and we all know everyone wanted them out.. Ugh
So my post game drinking worked - I'm pretty hungover. Let's get the day over with now... Sigh
@44Chavito thanks bud <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@77DoubleJ the only team to beat the hawks are the kings, and them being not as strong as last season we shall see how it goes
@77DoubleJ as long as the ducks or Chicago don't win I'm a happy camper :)
@77DoubleJ my best friend honestly. Known him for years and it grew on to me, also a Crosby fan. Fleury scares me post season though
@77DoubleJ I'll be rooting for the Penguins, but if not them, Flames or Blues. So again, good luck <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
But really though, lots of talent going into this post season. This should be an awesome playoffs!!! #StayingPositive
My best friend whose a sharks fan isn't giving me love tonight because he says it's "tough love." Fuck the Sharks!! <FLUSHED FACE>
@jctheshow yeah, at least no heart attacks in the post season. Those were the worst
@ellebee96 I have more booze <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> let's do it!
@77DoubleJ I don't have a problem with the Flames. I'd love the cup to stay in the West. Good luck, honestly. I'll be watching you guys!
I wasn't kidding. Shots time - let's go 
@jctheshow I really did! And I'm about to finally be healthy after that horrible week of allergies...
@jctheshow allergies? Huh?
@s2hduncan fuck off too soon.
If only we saved all those goals against the Oilers last week hahaha just kidding but really though.
Not gonna lie though, taking a few shots of vodka just because
@77DoubleJ it's all good, I was ready for this. I followed the flames season this year and beyond impressed with what they did. Good luck!!
@mzvelo74 backs up against the wall for so long, that's what you get. OH WELL! Next season
@mzvelo74 I was prepared for this moment last game. Not very shocked, this will be a long and quiet ride home for the boys that's for sure.
No words... No words... Oh well. Have a nice post season rest, LA Kings. We'll be coming for the cup next season. That is all. #LAKings
@LA_hockey_chick my thoughts exactly
@LA_hockey_chick it's a Canadian thing to do the wave at hockey games.. Don't ask why. They're Canadian
@77DoubleJ alrighty. There's a place called "total wine" where I live that has just about every booze around. Pretty cool. I'll check it out
@77DoubleJ you're so fancy! What's your favorite beer I should give a try? No IPA, I do not have an acquired taste for that
2-1 baby!!!!!
This cheered me up 
@thatgoalie13 I'll get some tomorrow. Really. I'll let you know how my experience goes
@thatgoalie13 haha just messing with you. I love cold blue moon it's so smooth and tastes amazing. Why change something I love?
@BillsExpert I don't know, I think pity sex is in order.. Probably.. Or booze
@thatgoalie13 sorry, what? I'm taking advise from someone who lives off keystone?
@thatgoalie13 I'm on my 4th blue moon, saving the other 2 for 3rd period now. They're frosty cold too, loser!
@thatgoalie13 rookie of the year, I like him. But keep that shit to yourself bud. I'm not sharing my beer with you now
Just saw that Kings/Flames couple on TV... Tonight should be interesting for the two of them. Wow..
@77DoubleJ that's your prerogative, bud
I feel better. I prayed and got a nice cold beer that was sitting in the freezer for a bit. GO KINGS GO!!!
@BrauckObama really?! Chirping me on snapchat??? How are your flyers doing?
Okay, definitely starting to feel sick now #LAKings
Nerves are setting in. All or nothing tonight... Please don't make me crazier than I already am during this game, @LAKings
@77DoubleJ those look delicious. I'm just staying with my usual @BlueMoonBrewCo 
@johnlcox6 ohhhh I see what you did there, good thing I got beer
@77DoubleJ what kind of beer are you drinking?
Debating wine or beer tonight. Either way to game goes I'm drinkin'. #GKG
@MJFrizzle @kingsfanone fo shizzle!! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
That moment you spend a good 10 minutes getting all the nasty inside of the peel off your orange, only to find it tastes horrible!
Okay, no idea the last time I purposely stayed up this late.. Yikes. Time flies when you're watching the Simpsons
@Dodgers this is beautiful
@Broncogrl25 @SoCalFanGirl @fearthefin lol good one. So true
@ChristianAllen1 @M_Stark11 DAMMIT WHY WAS I AWAY FROM MY PHONE DURING WHAT HAPPENED. DAMN DUCKS FANS
Chill out Rue 
Getting off work two hours early is definitely a nice surprise <OK HAND SIGN>
@77DoubleJ haha of course you do. Lookin' good cowboy <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Jaromir_Jagr <CROWN> - kings 

<PILE OF POO> - flyers
Can the NFL schedule come out already? I'm getting impatient waiting to plan my first trip to Buffalo for a game. #BillsMafia
@77DoubleJ are you going to go this year??
Pick meeee!!! I want to be there <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> @dirtysouth #Coachella2015 
@77DoubleJ yeah, been waiting a longgg time for them to come close to LA. I have heard of it, my best friend was there last year.Seems cool!
Yes! It's official, finally seeing one of favorite bands in August. #ThisIsHowWeRoll @FLAGALine <THUMBS UP SIGN> 

- Losers
@77DoubleJ doesn't get any more random than that. Might have been his expression after reading it too..
@77DoubleJ I don't know why, but I lost it at this one.. These are so hilariously bad 
I noticed there's not a heart emoji next to your name on snapchat... Someone's got some explaining to do <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@BDeegs alright bud, now you're askin for it
I would appreciate it if nobody mentioned the Kings to me today, that would be really cool #thanks
@krisp8693 yeah, I am. I have a clearer head about everything this morning, but it's going to be a sucky day that's for sure.
This cheered me up for sure 
@77DoubleJ I can, since they're in our way! I'm done here <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@77DoubleJ sounds awful! Lol. And to think I was actually rooting for what the flames were doing this year. Still impressed though, but ugh
@77DoubleJ Ughhh I don't want to talk hockey anymore. <WEARY FACE>
@77DoubleJ hah yeah, I must sound totally spoiled right now. It just sucks when you KNOW your team is better than that!!  Grrrrr
@77DoubleJ what? You're not rooting for the flames to lose? MindBlown. But yeah, I'm just blah right now. See you Thursday..
@mzvelo74 TOO SOO FOR THAT SHIT. I can't even right now
@77DoubleJ we've been hoping the flames and jets would lose these last couple months but they won't. I know they're not out, but really...
@77DoubleJ yep, very sad evening over here. Oh well, can't be champs every season. We'll see what the next few games bring for everyone <CONFUSED FACE>
@77DoubleJ quick needed a rest,but no time for quick to sit. I knew playing the oilers wasn't going to be easy, but it was a team loss 4sure
@Mastersloan you can be positive and a frustrated fan at the same time.
@Mastersloan yes... I get this...
@Mastersloan well I'm still going to support, it's just really embarrassing to not make the playoffs being current stanley cup champs <CONFUSED FACE>
@Mastersloan I'm sick of that believe crap. Hasn't worked for us. Depending on the flames or jets to lose isn't happening either. JS
If you want to look on the bright side, at least we won't have to go through another brutally painful game 7 to watch. <CRYING FACE>
If Kings don't win the cup NOBODY GETS TO WIN THE CUP. I won't allow it, nope
@87ASandhu stop talkin shit behind my back come at me bro
@87ASandhu unfollowing you
There's two type of people on my twitter feed: People who are rooting for the Kings and then Kings HATERSSSS #GOKINGSGO
@87ASandhu unfollow
God bless Drew Doughty.. Now let's tie it up
@K_DUBB_80 dodgers don't care about their fans!!!! It's not right! Greedy bastards
I would really love to watch the Dodgers during Kings intermission... BUT I CANT
@melnyk16 still no excuse why kings can't keep up with them.
@melnyk16 oilers can play like they're not one of the worst teams in the league sometimes. Tonight is that night.
@87ASandhu go away.
Fuckin' awful.. Come on, Kings
Damn, Penguins lost <CONFUSED FACE> now it's time for the Kings to win!
@k20Hudson oh I will <WINKING FACE> feel better my love
Drinking a nice cold @BlueMoonBrewCo beer for #NationalBeerDay <CLINKING BEER MUGS> #TheBest
Don't mind me, just walking my cat 
@AlexMorgan_33 #ABitchThatWonUs2StanleyCups #Champion #LumbusHasWhat
@AlexMorgan_33 hahah! I kind of had a feeling you would see this. #BetterInLAThanLumbus
I just voted Jeff Carter for @McDonalds_SoCal Player of the Year. Go here to cast your vote: 
@Rich_Hammond he's all we got at this point, unfortunately. Unless the boys want to work hard in front of him, that would be great
@Indykidd33 who the hell blamed quick?
Stupid Vancouver
@VanCanucks no they do not!
Please tell me that Kings will finish these last few games playing a lot better than this game. #believe
@seanfeely80 k
Man, that was a really cool but I hate it. Stupid Sedin twins.. Go kings!! <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
Go Kings Go!!! A huge must-win game tonight. Should be a good one.. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@ShawnNandal haha!! Yeah, I'm sure I'll find a way to watch a lot of the games..
@ShawnNandal yep, but my last day there is Friday so I'm on my own after that
@krisp8693 yeah, hope so too! Jets need to LOSE!!
@ShawnNandal yep! One of my jobs has TWC which is only playing the games so I was able to watch it. A lot of last season too!
JIMMY ROLLINS OH BABY!!!! #Dodgers 6-3

You look good in Bills gear. 
@ChristianAllen1 sorry, I'm sure you can understand with a new job.
@ChristianAllen1 I don't think I'll be able to make the game on the 18th, but I'm pretty sure the day before I can make it for your bday
@M_Stark11 haha okay, I'll move into Katie's room
@iwantmydodgers yeah! Well I hope you can do it too. Always fun to represent in enemy territory
@iwantmydodgers I'm looking forward to going to SD to see them play the Padres in September. Hear it's pretty cool there
@iwantmydodgers haha trust me! I want to be able to go to as many games as I can this season..
@iwantmydodgers guess I'll have to be streaming them online AGAIN this season. <PENSIVE FACE>
@krisp8693 tarantula hill, I drive by it all the time to get to work 
All I want is a baseball season where I can watch #Dodgers baseball on tv
@krisp8693 haha who would have thought theres a Canadian who doesn't like hockey
@Project_305 never!!!! Always regretted it
Never too old for Pokemon 
@krisp8693 oh look at you dating a 21 yr old. Get her into hockey!!!
@krisp8693 kid in 93 or born in 93? Kinda thought you were old, but that's what happens when you're so mysterious online haha!
@EngellandsEye I'm so sorry! I just lost one of my cats to oral cancer. RIP Bandit!!! Go penguins
@EngellandsEye poor baby! What kind of cancer does he have???
Family coming over for brunch, not sure if I want to put on a bra and pants. I'm sure Jesus would be okay with that.
@krisp8693 1993..woah. Against the Kings too.. Well i know Canadians teams are the most passionate. Except VAN. Jk. But I respect that.
@krisp8693 I know right, so glad I didn't have to wait till I was old to experience it :)
@M_Stark11 wow! That's pretty cool, congrats. Lucky you got to watch the game, I was working. But now I'm off! In 3 mins...
@M_Stark11 oh yeahhhh duh. <CRYING FACE>
@M_Stark11 so were you at the game tonight? Wow! Lucky Martinez jersey!!!
@krisp8693 I grew up going to kings game with my dad and sister, but my best friend is Canadian so he definitely helped
@M_Stark11 hahaha I miss you too!!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Welp, looks like it's just going to be all Kings tonight. No help from other teams, like usual. Boooo #GKG #PlayoffPush
What I'm doing at work.... #Hockey 
@thatgoalie13 wow, did you buy keystone for all the frats in college?

Blocked by an assistant coach? 
@krisp8693 wow! That's literally right in my town, how cool! I hike that hill all the time... I'm sure it's been found though <PENSIVE FACE>
When you really didn't feel like making your plans tonight but your friend calls instead and asks if we can do it tomorrow instead. YES
Spur of the moment drive to the beach sounds really good right now... <WATER WAVE><PALM TREE>
@TimCielinski isn't that the first purchase every new Blackhawks fan purchases? Ha! Or Kaner..
Sabres would... They would...
Hahah!!! I have my funny moments... #SharksSuck 
Netflix in bed with a cat on my lap is really amazing 
@BradArscott @NHL thank you. Any hockey fan is a friend of mine :) unless you're a ducks, hawks or sharks fan...
@hitmenhockey14 wow, I remember saying that too... 5 years ago. Time goes by fast - happy birthday
@BradArscott @NHL but I'm a bigger hockey fan, end of story
@BradArscott @NHL that is so not true and you know that, NHL. You love kings fans more than leafs fans, so follow meeee
@BradArscott @NHL don't try and steal my follow!!! Please follow me :)
@NHL can you guys follow me? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
You got a cat? Cause I feel something lickin' me
@himynameisaldo free yearly tickets and can get up to 4 people in with a parent since one of them is an engineer for the Disney company
My Dad is watching his Apple TV in the living room and I keep playing my music through spotify on it and he's getting so mad hahaha
@NHLWinnipeg oilers or not, it's still very impressive
@Skewlgal that's what I thought too!
Holy shit... 3-0 already. CANT STOP WONT STOP, I LOVE IT #LAKings
@77DoubleJ oh I'll get to them when they play next! That will please us both at least
FLAMES LOST!!!! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><PARTY POPPER> now it's time for the Kings to WIN!!! #PlayoffPush
@jlock4820 I've never seen so many idiots pose so closely to a burning vehicle before.
#embarrassing  
Whenever I feel sad I just watch the Vancouver riots from the 2011 SCF.
April fools Simpsons style! 


The fact that my tv remote has a Netflix button, that's all I need in the world #truestory
Holy shit I've never seen so many Brady attire in my life. #PatriotsSuck #Cheaters
@THEsak9599 hah!! It is the silliest invention ever
@THEsak9599 haha that's a negative!
@jctheshow hell ya, I've seen so many different teams represented today, so glad I could.
Having a great time <CLINKING BEER MUGS> 
@ChristianAllen1 okay, I have to see what my work schedule will be like.
@ChristianAllen1 sounds good to me! When's your bday?
@ChristianAllen1 next time I'll take you!! Maybe after the stupid summer Disney crowd
@ChirpTheDusters don't judge me. I go to Disneyland like 5x a year, I can do what I want!
@Baseball_Life31 I only respect a go pro on those things..
@Baseball_Life31 bringing them at a concert is stupid. A thousand dollar iPhone on a 10 dollar stick
@ChirpTheDusters yeah.. I mean, I was just watching from the outside. Not like I was in line for that ride or anything <FLUSHED FACE>
DONT BE THIS GUY!!! #SelfieStick 
@77DoubleJ guess we won't know for a couple more weeks... <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
Tempted to crack open the vodka bottle I was saving for tomorrow #KingsMakeMeSad
@77DoubleJ I don't blame you. Flames deserve every bit of it
@77DoubleJ lies
@77DoubleJ they're not welcome!!!!
Don't let anyone tell you your team sucks, especially a Canucks fan. Like don't even get me started...
And to think I could have been watching Better Call Saul instead of this "game." Darn
Wait, there are Kings players in front of Quick? Could have fooled me
@TCaddy6 ew, basketball
@TCaddy6 funny how that works out... #shitcago
My God these Blackhawks announcers are annoying
I was lucky enough to start getting bad allergy symptoms. That's really cool considering I have never had them before. That blows.
Why do the nurses insist on bringing you into the doctors office to wait 30 fucking minutes? I was fine in the waiting room
@blckbsct no problem at all?
Planning for Disneyland tomorrow. This is what we worry about #alcoholic #notreally 
I changed my time on my phone to military time since I use it to often at my job, and I gotta say it's throwing me off. I don't like it
@erikthatdude uhhh who are you???
Wifi is weak outside. This break sucks
30 minute break at work. What do I do?? Work is just a long break for me anyways

Rex + Terry = 2GETHR 4EVR: 
You know you're exhausted when you put your pajamas on backwards.. Twice..
I don't know what's more pathetic, someone having a snapchat story over 3 minute long or the fact I just watched all of it.
@Steph_Sampson not fair <UNAMUSED FACE>
Reading my timeline about the Kings game yet I can't watch it. It's killing meeee
@LAKings UGH we'll make a comeback on the game where we need to make a comeback to make the playoffs, yaaaa something like that
That moment when you find the password for the wifi at your job <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Working 3-11 does nottttt sound very appealing right now. <CONFUSED FACE>
@SpamAvocado nah only at cranes underground right now
@SpamAvocado I'm in LA though ;)
@SpamAvocado I wish!!!! I'm working
Who is in LA and wants to hang?! Might as well since I'm out here.
Holy shit @amyschumer was so hot tonight. Seriously, I'd go lesbian for this chick. Amazing
Almost off work! Will be on my way to Los Angeles to see the lovely @amyschumer <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

I'm without the dogs at my work today, this is the worst day ever! I'm going to be so bored nowww <NEUTRAL FACE>
@NHL @AlexMorgan_33 okay NOW I'm officially done
@Ginohard_ <UNAMUSED FACE>
@purodoyer <VICTORY HAND>️
@87ASandhu next they're going to say it's the refs
@blckbsct I see the glass is all frosty! So jealous
I just realized I could play Spotify off my phone on Apple TV. Now that's life changing. #EndlessSkips #PandoraSucks
@blckbsct that looks soooo good right about now
Wow, Ducks would tie it up with 30 seconds left. Barf
@jlock4820 she's happy the Kings won
2 POINTS!!! 3rd PLACE!!! GO KINGS GO! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>

@Lhultin YEAHHH!!' Kopistar!!!
SHORTY BABY!! Tavares, what's good?!
@Lhultin @LAKings yep, same here!!! It was pretty bad..
@LAKings jk I don't want to be one of those fans, but really, I'm saying KOPITAR
@LAKings the refs if they make the right calls
@LAKings lmao what trash. <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
This is going to be a scary 3rd. Oh boy <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #GKG
What the hell, Drew???? Seriously?
@BOYABOVE kings looked better 1st, must have missed that. But NYI definitely stepped it up this period, impressive
Thank god, I was about to go fuckin crazy right there. <UNAMUSED FACE> 1-1
It may be scoreless after the 1st, but Kings killed it that period! Keep doing what you're doing <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #LAKings
@AlexMorgan_33 do what you want, I already know you're not the brightest with your choice in teams! I'll just rub it in when I was right <WINKING FACE>
@AlexMorgan_33 you know what to do....
@BillShaikin so does this mean they'll be on tv???? Since we have such awesome fans?
@AlexMorgan_33 screw Getzlafff it's all Kopi, he's been racking up points lately. Kings are on a roll
#FunFact it's impossible for girls with tongue piercings to take a picture without their tongue out.

@thatgoalie13 "do you want a quote? Of course you do" hahhh
@thatgoalie13 I'm going to fill this bad boy out 
@thatgoalie13 haha!! So true
@DavidKehrli be thankful it's only been 20 years. Meanwhile our fans had to wait 45..
@DavidKehrli Ughhh blaming the refs is the lowest of the low sometimes. Especially during the SCF. Meanwhile they had more PP's than us...
@DavidKehrli they're just so whiney, like they think the nhl revolves around them. I think they're great this year, but don't be annoying
Ink Master marathon on Netflix right now.. It's too addictive to just keep playing the next episode. I want a tattoo now <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@J_Wall32 uh oh! I remember last time you drunk tweeted me...
@77DoubleJ yeah, clearly with him being gone it hasn't really phased you guys one bit.. Ughh <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> this last few weeks will be stressful
@77DoubleJ I know, what's up with that. I thought jets would be falling off a few weeks ago, meanwhile MIN sneaks up. Scary!
@mzvelo74 yeah, agreed. Scraping for a spot the last week isn't my ideal way of ending the regular season
@77DoubleJ I love the way kings play when their backs are up against the wall. Comin' in hot!! <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
@77DoubleJ nahhhh one point ahead you silly Canadian. Ya'll only managed 1 point tonight <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@DallasStars woahhh woah woahhh, Just shut up and win the games on the 28th and 30th, thanks
@mzvelo74 this playoff push has got me all pumped. Bring it!!
Tomorrow... Kings take sole possession of 3rd place. So people can shut up about the "well kings aren't even in the playoffs" bullshit. Thx
@77DoubleJ Flames and their comebacks, I can't even be mad at this point just impressed.Engelland was awesome tonight,who would have thought
@87ASandhu I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know I didn't really mean that... But really, screw the flames
@87ASandhu so are the #CANUCKS
DAMN YOU DALLAS, GOOD FOR NOTHING..
@77DoubleJ oh gosh <SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE>
@77DoubleJ nooooo bueno noooo
@TuroThinksBlue yep! I'm watching the game  <EYES>
Go Dallassss beat the Flames!! <FIRE>
I hate the Flyers and Hawks, but I'm all for rooting for them when they fight trash Carcillo
Watching Kindergarten Cop at work.. Awww yeaaahhh one of my favorite movies
@krisp8693 haha ahhhhh that one
@JunkoDisparte @Steph_Sampson yesss that means I don't have to sell my body anymore to pay my bills. God bless
@Steph_Sampson pretty sure he was the first person to raise the cup when they won the Stanley cup. Obviously
@M_Stark11 I don't think so. I'm already broke &amp; now I have a ticket to pay for. Not a good time for me right now <PENSIVE FACE> maybe last min!
@M_Stark11 sooo many people bashing him, and then either gets an assist or goal after making a stupid play....
@Steph_Sampson this guy acts like Kings fans didn't wait 45 FUCKIN YEARS for a cup and they won in 94-laughed so hard 
@M_Stark11 9 goals is not often! Although he is the leading defensive scorer.Always nice to see him score since he can be an idiot sometimes
@Steph_Sampson actually, they've been solid since '94. I would know since this moron sent me facts...
@M_Stark11 and Muzzin scored his 9th goal!
@krisp8693 my dodgers shirt? With the kings logo on it?
@DavidKehrli if you watched the kings game tonight against the Rags, and they keep playing like that, we will without a doubt
This is what my mom sends me. Hahahh my cat <GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
Any guy that doesn't like boobs showing is low key gay
@M_Stark11 hahah like they would show any support for the Kings after tonight. What a game to be at though!!!
@M_Stark11 sexy jersey you got there!
All I've done at work so far is watch hockey and study for a test that's Thursday. Easiest day in a while..
@krisp8693 I like to talk smack on the NHL FB page and sometimes the internet warriors like to send me a friendly message :)
CARTERRRRR 3-1 babyyyyy
@jctheshow hahaha right, like they knew what was going on with us in the 90's.
"Wahhh I'm a salty Rangers fan" is all I'm reading in this message. Poor guy, wonder how he's handling tonights game<WINKING FACE> 
Go Kings Go!!!! Love this 2-1 lead against the Rags. Let's keep it up in the 3rd.
@mzvelo74 yes daddy :(
@mzvelo74 first citation is 150 after court fees, booooo
@thatgoalie13 lived dangerously - got traffic ticket. Yeah, never again
@thatgoalie13 blue tooth is already hooked up in my new car. Would have saved me a ticket but I'm dumb
@jctheshow yeah, my fault totally.It sucks. It didn't put me too bad of a mood though, just the fact this work shift I'm at now is pointless
Only someone stupid enough to talk on their phone when they have Bluetooth would get a ticket.. Oh yeah, ME. Fuck
I've seen about 5 cars who still have their Rudolph nose on the front of it since Christmas. How embarrassing
@LAKings this is the greatest ever. Seinfeld and Kings hockey are my favorite things
@MJFrizzle ohhh better yet, I hear the Ebola scare is coming back. Measles seems more logical for Dland though
@MJFrizzle haha yessss now I get it. My bad, just planning my evil scheme is all
@MJFrizzle I would still go.. Now to mass message tv stations that "my child has symptoms of measles after going to Disneyland last month"
So I'm going to Disneyland next week and I wish I could start a rumor that the measles outbreak is back so it's not busy..... Smart, I know
Watching Sex Tape and my city gets mentioned. Totally wasn't expecting that.. Funny movie #TO 
@waynestell thanks bud :)
@M_Stark11 why couldn't we have been close when you made these planss wahhhhh... Bring luck to NJ!! GKG
@M_Stark11 not fair! I should be there right now
Please Hockey Gods let the #LAKings score more than just one goal this game and win..
@MJFrizzle a simple humanities class about art. I'm glad it's just that and not Physiology or Anatomy or something, ya know? But still...
@MJFrizzle exactly. This professor is so unorganized though, always late and mixing around the syllabus. It was doomed from the start
@MJFrizzle lol I'm just annoying him by sending him a few emails. Don't want to hear the "oh I don't think I got it" excuse tomorrow <UNAMUSED FACE>
Nothing worse than having a professor that doesn't even email back. So damn frustrating

Alright, Netflix with my cat sounds a lot better than going out right now... As sad as that sounds
Yes off work! Now I'm debating if I want to go out or not tonight <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>

@OGPimpbot I know, trust me I'm so bummed I can't be out drinking green beer tonight
Working 4-12am tonight.  Blahhhh at least my job is cool
@NOT_Milan_Lucic I hate the guy but I'll never know the emotions of going through the toughest playoffs.everything all on the line and gone!
@NOT_Milan_Lucic lololol I just watched game 7 SCF last night too. Vancouver... Losers
Quickest way to get friendzoned is to have the same name as his mom. Makes sense..
It took the oilers all of 1 minute to score the first goal...
@kanyewest but why is she covering up? Not like there isn't anything we haven't all seen before
Yay I'm freeeeee!! Now to get home and sleep because I have my other job at 7am. Ha
@himynameisaldo I'm working at an eating disorder treatment house. Its an awesome job but it can get boring at night
Really exhausted and am working till 11.. Someone keep me company!
@OmarKelly @devinericarcher no, he just blocks them cause he can't handle criticism
It's alright, @LAKings I was planning on drinking tonight anyways... #L
OH MY GOD ITS 3-0 now...
LEAFS.. YOU FUCKING TURDS
Meanwhile it's almost 90 degrees and I'm wearing a sundress at 5pm. Summer is hereeee
2012 Stanley cup final, where Steve Bernier ruined if for the NJ Devils to try to make it to Game 7. Lol
Literally just grabbed popcorn and drunkenly watching game 6 of 2012 of the SCF... GO KINGS GOOOOO
@DravenIM the first couple days you gave me the info I was sooooo into it. Love you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@DravenIM I know, you can go to each team and watch like their last 30 games of the season and it goes for back to '11 I think
@himynameisaldo oh wait, you're the patriots fan.. Uhhh I think I'm busy tomorrow ;)
@himynameisaldo my only free day after tonight is tomorrow since I'm so damn busy with my new job
@77DoubleJ it's getting down to the wire, I can't be nice anymore
Hahah this commercial is hilarious. 


Debating to get ready and go out or stay inside and catch up on some MUCH needed sleep. Vodka is ready to pour on ice..
@77DoubleJ you better enjoy these last few weeks of hockey left for your flames cause there won't be a postseason for y'all!
@derek_ens okay, so I'd imagine it somethingg like that with CBC. Go kings!
@derek_ens all playoff games after the 1st round are on NBCSN! Or whatever the Canadian version that is <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@derek_ens have to get it in October when it's the cheapest <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@TrueBlueLowry21 I'll be sure to buy it beginning of next season though. Its the best.
@TrueBlueLowry21 a nice twitter friend of mine gave me his Info for it so I've been taking advantage of it the past few months.
Re-watching so many games from last seasons playoffs on NHL center ice. I'll never go a season without it now that I've been using it
@EricCooney well look at all the stuff they've been going through.Was worth a shot to maybe hope they could pull off a W tonight but oh well
@EricCooney sometimes they can play really well. Ppl always say that yet we barely beat them 1-0 last game and they beat us gm before that
Of course it's 4-1 Calgary... FML
I'm so tired I almost left my house with no bra on. That would have been interesting
@himynameisaldo uhhhh yeah, sure.... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@beantowndleelee I didn't read the details, my bad. But still.. Patriots.. Ugh
I'm definitely not a coffee person, but it's much needed today considering I've had maybe a total of 10 hours of sleep the past 3 nights. <HOT BEVERAGE>️
@_Matt22 but what game?
@AdamSchefter I really liked him as a Bill, but to join a team we hate is fucked up. <VICTORY HAND>️
@himynameisaldo ugh patriots fans aren't allowed to talk to me <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@_Matt22 agreed. Until then... Go kings go!
@_Matt22 or maybe they realized you were an angels fan instead of dodgers.. Ohhhhh
@ajwilliams23 touchdown celebration for next season? Let's go buffaloooo <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

@ShawnNandal graciassss. I'm a nurses assistant at a drug/alcohol/eating disorder facility
Reading the tweets on my timeline about the Kings/Nucks game and it sucks to not being able to watch it <PENSIVE FACE>
Just drove by Hooters and I saw everyone having fun at the watch party <WEARY FACE> but on the plus side my work is awesome so far
@himynameisaldo I would since I live in Thousand Oaks, but I start my new job in an hour so I'm going to miss it <CRYING FACE>
@STLouisRams good to see it's no longer Bradford
@thxbud all my friends think I'm crazy for thinking that but I don't see why they wouldn't. Ducks are dicks
@WerewolfAndros I mean, I'll wear sunglass inside in some places, but not in class. I once saw someone wear them at the gym!
You kind of look like a douchebag when you walk into class with your sunglasses on
@TrueBlueLowry21 @M_Stark11 lol this girl is a stank ass hoe.
@M_Stark11 wait, this is it?? Is that her Instagram account? Sounds like it! Lol block that bitch

@thatgoalie13 lmao flyers season is a joke.. Better hockey being played in LA sweetie
I'm actually getting into the Buffalo/Toronto game.. Tied up at 3 now <HUSHED FACE>
@ChristianAllen1 okay, I was going to say.. I would have been extra sad for missing it then
@ChristianAllen1 what? You're not coming to Thousand Oaks
@pucktacular I'm a nurses assistant at a treatment facility that specializes in drugs/alcohol rehab and eating disorders.
@pucktacular thank you! Very excited <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Very torn that I'll miss the official watch party at the T.O. Hooters tomorrow as I'm starting my first day at the new job. #OhWell #GKG

@Thegetawayplan9 @Broncogrl25 everyone says that but he's not as bad as a lot of people say. Like you. Doubt you even watch penguins hockey
@Broncogrl25 and there's a lot of people who like to hate on him for no reason? I don't get it
@Broncogrl25 @ChristianAllen1 thanks for caring Christian. But my shift is safe if you were wondering <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> don't fuckin care haters
@Broncogrl25 maybe because he's an amazing player?

@WerewolfAndros what did I do??!!
@mzvelo74 next he's going to tell me he hates cats <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@jctheshow haha yeah, doubt he likes baseball then, but if he did I'm sure he would like few best team ever! An NO that's not the giants <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@77DoubleJ why so serioussss
@jctheshow he said he doesn't watch it because it's too slow, but damn
@77DoubleJ I'm a nurse, so me seeing people getting injured just makes me cringe. Blah.. Anyways..
@JonJahant I loved Kiko, we already had a tight D so I'm not too sad. Good LB's like him are rare but we just got stronger with Shady
@mzvelo74 he loves MMA and basketball! WTF!!!!
@77DoubleJ yeah, i wouldn't watch fighting matches. I hate people hurting other people, but I despise basketball
@Broncogrl25 I know, never thought I'd have the power like that. Kinda cool
@himynameisaldo I loved Kiko, we already had a tight D so I'm not too sad. Good LB's like him are rare but we just got stronger with Shady
@77DoubleJ he likes mma and basketball. I flippin hate basketball.
@KingsMenPodcast @AlexMorgan_33 FOREVER.... FOREVER #77
@SoCalSledHockey lol it's going to be a slow and long process getting through hockey and football season with him <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@77DoubleJ he isn't a hockey fan! But he said he always wanted to learn about it, so I will have to teach him..
@Broncogrl25 he's not a hockey fan, but he wants to learn which I like
So I'm talking to this new guy who doesn't like football. I should probably just break it off already since he's obviously gay
I missed barely one minute of the 3rd period and Kopi scores? Damn #GKG
@Rich_Hammond MindBlown!!
@ChirpTheDusters two teams who should both lose.. Nice seats though <WINKING FACE>
@ChirpTheDusters there was an oilers fan who stood up and waved during the game and I thought of you.
ERMAHGERD KINGS SHORTY 3-0
ERMAHGERD ROBYN REGEEEEHRRR 
@pucktacular okay, you'll be the exception
So glad I'm not an Eagles fan at the moment. Don't worry, I'll have a drink for you. #Eagles #Bills #ChipKelly
@pucktacular I totally did not see that coming.. Wow

Very excited that I got a new job as a nurses assistant with a drug/alcohol and eating disorder facility. Interesting stuff!!
@ChirpTheDusters haha such a damn hypocrite. Guess we both have a busy day tomorrow..
@ChirpTheDusters whenever I feel lonely I like to look at my gmail and pretend those are letters from my friends. What's it to ya
Holy shit, I was just thinking to myself how I didn't want to do the homework for class tomorrow.I could cry so happy 
@ChirpTheDusters yep, it does suck

Trying to fit in 3 interviews after school and before the Kings game tomorrow is DIFFICULT Ughhh
Watching dodgers squeeze play just to pass the time while I'm missing baseball 
Babe @dewyy8 
@M_Stark11 kings don't lose on legends night! Which means we should be good for March 7th :D
#LAKings have <DIGIT EIGHT + COMBINING ENCLOSING KEYCAP> in a row <CROWN>!!!! See you Thursday, boys! Can't wait #GKG Quick with the SHUTOUT!
#LAKings throwing it back by wearing the Forum gold this game.. Let's hope it's the same outcome like last time <WINKING FACE>
Lmao.. Does a guy really think a girl likes it when he sends a dick pic and then a video of it? What the fuck, sounds desperate
@TheHockeyChat I'm actually going to buffalo for the beginning of football season for a game. Heading to Toronto to see HHOF <WINKING FACE> let's go lol
@TheHockeyChat oh always kings before anyone. But I like the penguins, even though a lot of people believe you can't have more than 1 team<FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@TheHockeyChat not judging at all, glad you still support them! How many times have you been to the hockey hall of fame?
@TheHockeyChat who's your team??
Stupid cat always hops in the fridge when it opens #Butters 
@A_Banner32 ya but he like spent 20 mins in the truck.. Wasn't sure what happened after that
@A_Banner32 well I mean, did they shoot him? Dead? Attack by K9?
Wait, what happened after that car chase earlier?! I fell asleep and really want to know lol
@vapper1971 he has already hit a few pedestrians! What a wacko
Why do people go on high-speed pursuits?? Aren't they aware of how high the gas prices are?
@lakingsinsider @M_Stark11 wonder whose going to be in net for Anaheim. Prob Quick, so if Jones in net thurs, I got you covered #Gongala
@thatgoalie13 they should be thanking us for filling up their TL with such entertainment <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@thatgoalie13 lol definitely not, was just kind of funny
@thatgoalie13 lmaooo you're something else
@thatgoalie13 haha sorry bud. Monday mornings sometimes bring out the worst in people
@thatgoalie13 don't talk about my kings! I mean, I have a hard time trusting anyone who believe keystone is quality beer <SMIRKING FACE>
@thatgoalie13 oh I completely disagree, I was just too repulsed to finish my sentence
@thatgoalie13 "favorite flyers fan" oh man! It's too early for that nonsense <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@thatgoalie13 it's kind of sad if you think about it, but I don't know any better
@thatgoalie13 it was 46 degrees when I got in my car this morning, It was bad!
@M_Stark11 working at 7am though is a little more difficult than working at 11 though haha
I don't want to work in the morning <PENSIVE FACE>
A few of my favorite things #Cats #Beer #Seinfeld 
Hockey in California shapchat story was worth the watch
Getting my booze on at my sisters baby shower.. Because I'm not ready to be an aunt <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
Nothing like a hyper kitten keeping you up all night...
@ChristianAllen1 yayyyy!!! Invasion! See you there :)
@ChristianAllen1 awwwww I miss you guys :(
@ChristianAllen1 if I could go back in time, I would have gone with you guys tonight
@DavidKehrli @DownGoesBrown lmao!!!! That's a good one
Lmao, ruthless... Especially to an FSU fan 
@77DoubleJ yeah, I haven't really looked around though. I'm sure it could find some if I really wanted to
@77DoubleJ oh, no. I've looked at Canadian brews before at places that sell booze from around the world. Didn't have much there for it
@77DoubleJ I did google it after haha. Ummm I've bought labatt blue here before, that's about it.
@77DoubleJ yeah, it is. Look at you
@77DoubleJ I have no idea <NEUTRAL FACE> I wish I were a beer snob
KINGS WON!!!! #StadiumSeries
@77DoubleJ it's delicious, I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like this beer
LMAO.. Best drinking game for this #StadiumSeries game is take a shot for every fuckin car commercial they show
@77DoubleJ I live in the 805.. They brew this on the central Cali coast I believe.

@M_Stark11 she must be really confused though, she's probably like "wait, I thought he was just there to fight, didn't know he scored goals"
@M_Stark11 I know right, Brittany must be so excited <UNAMUSED FACE>
YEAH BABY THATS HOW ITS GONNA BE, SCREW YOU SHARKS FANS YOURE GOING HOME AS LOSERS TONIGHT SHSLDKBDHDMD
Pia is better than you, CHRIS ALLEN
Why the eff would they use this song to start off the game? #StadiumSeries
Ewwww all that teal in the stands #barf #StadiumSeries
Representing my signed Doughty jersey tonight! Go KINGS <FISTED HAND SIGN> #StadiumSeries
Go kings go! Currently boozing it up #StadiumSeries 
Max1980 FTW 
@ChristianAllen1 me too, trust me <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> but it sucks to be a broke college student
Pretty hungover from last night, but that just means day drinking until #StadiumSeries game. #GKG!
@mzvelo74 meanwhile I'm as single as could be and don't have anywhere close to that kind of baggage <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@mzvelo74 I think she actually has a boyfriend  <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Whenever I feel bad, I just remember there's a girl in my graduating class with two kids with two different dad's and has been divorced <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
Sometimes it's hard to choose between Seinfeld and the Simpsons when they're both on tv at the same time
@nihlus hahah I have seen this entire show years ago, it was my favorite.
@nihlus best uncle around
Grounded For Life on #Netflix!!! Yesss never going to bed now
@ragland03 when I was little my mom used to always tell me they were painting inside so it wasn't open
@NHL that's not a crappy view or anything..
@VanCanucks ole' circle around the puck.. Hah! Good stuff
Crosby in a scrap!! #Penguins
That's really weird, I have someone on twitter as my snapchat friend but we don't even follow each other on here <FLUSHED FACE>
This is the funniest thing I've seen all day, the music completes it haha 


#LAKings #SixInARow <PARTY POPPER>
Hahah that Rex Ryan Pizza Hut commercial.. How come this is the first time I've seen it?! I miss football
@Rich_Hammond wait, Voynov and Mitchell are out?!
So hard to bring myself to do homework between intermissions <NEUTRAL FACE>
Quick is starting... Kind of surprising
<UNAMUSED FACE><ANGRY FACE><ANGRY FACE><ANGRY FACE><ANGRY FACE><ANGRY FACE> ONE JOB!!!!
Yes! Good job Detroit!
@StubHub that would be really cool and I hate basketball
.@77DoubleJ hehe 
Lol Sharks. 
I asked my sister why she wears this Angels hat and she said she just likes it because of the color. What a joke
@J_Wall32 haha no worries, it was entertaining
@J_Wall32 sounds difficult, I didn't learn about that in marine biology school
@J_Wall32 .... I remember my first beer <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@J_Wall32 The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
@J_Wall32 well I have watched finding Nemo about a million times since it is my favorite movie. Sooooooob
@J_Wall32 you'd think being a hero would be cooler though..
@J_Wall32 HAHA!! It's okay, drunk tweeting. Been there done that
Sooooo my 8am class sounds like I won't be there in the morning.. #Goodnight
@himynameisaldo I had so much fun with them last game! So happy I saw these guys
I made Toronto friends <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> 
Drew to Carter oh baby no chance #LAKings
@LAKings true story. I hit it on the way to the game
#Kings1
McBain and McNabb are the McDouble!!!!
GO KINGS GO @M_Stark11 
Drank too much whiskey last night <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C> but I'm so excited to be at the Kings game tonight!
@k20Hudson funny considering they have won 4 games straight and are playing a lot better than they were. You'll see <WAVING HAND SIGN><WAVING HAND SIGN>
@k20Hudson "settled" for the penguins lol.Alright, well jets won't even make the playoffs, they're going to struggle when its most important
@k20Hudson already rooting for the hawks because you realize your jets aren't going to make postseason?
I like when games are on NBC so I don't have to get out of bed to watch hockey #LetsGoPens

@77DoubleJ for sure.. Well have a nice night <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@77DoubleJ oh don't be so sad.. Flames have won 3 of the 4 games so far this season between the two??
@77DoubleJ wow, seems comfortable. Time to break out the tank tops and sandals <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@77DoubleJ I wonder how bad that trip home was for them. They were too busy enjoying California weather on their fathers trip
@77DoubleJ just a joke, eh. Canadians...
@77DoubleJ I like Johnny Hockey, but this clearly looks fake. It's not fair for the Flames to give their fans a false hope for postseason
@77DoubleJ 
And the winning steak continues for the #LAKings. Way to go, boys!!!! Go Kings Go! <PARTY POPPER>
@waynestell @LAKings Kings and I are going out for drinks after the game  <WINKING FACE>
Who needs a Valentine when you can lay in bed with your cat and watch the Kings game #amazing

@77DoubleJ @NHLFlames well we know that won't last very long.. Hehe
It's safe to say I should probably shave before tonight #ValentinesDay
@Based_Sniper91 @MattyBRaps this makes me uncomfortable !
Who am I to judge, but I think it's about time to take the Rudolph nose off the front of your car
@LAKings @BlueJacketsNHL so technically since our teams are lovers we're just obligated to be together @AlexMorgan_33
Really nice day at the beach <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> #californiawinter #daydrinking 
*Insert cliche picture of me and my Valentine*
I love how it's supposed to be 80 degrees at the beach tomorrow. Cant wait <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@TDGawd agree 100% hate movie dates especially when you're first getting to know someone
Seeing 50 Shades of Grey for Valentines Day seems like the worst date ever
#BlazeNGlory festival is official! Got my 2-day passes and campsite reservations. Looking forward to it! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
Screw chocolate, this is what I want for #ValentinesDay 
@marcotwentysix #h8er
@iSteven23 well I went out tonight, but I'm awake no later than 6:30 during the week for work/school. So my mental alarm goes off <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@iSteven23 I always put my phone on do not disturb at night, and since it's Friday everyone will be out of the house by 8am. Yes!!! #Sleep
You have no idea how excited I am to sleep in tomorrow. Hoping I can sleep past 8am this time. Fingers crossed <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
HAHA, only I would start falling for a guy whose an Angels AND Patriots fan. Wow!!! Two of my three worst enemies in sports. Yikes
@M_Stark11 Carlos!!!! Yesssss.. Let's hope Monday has the same outcome for us
LA KINGS IN PLAYOFF MODE LETS GO BABY... Don't count us out just yet! #GoKingsGo
@Lhultin should be like... 10-3 hah
@77DoubleJ baby I can go all night!!!!!
@77DoubleJ wow, check out the SOG... Flames aren't lookin too hot right now
@77DoubleJ that was so flippin sweet... <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
TOFFOLI WITH THE HATTY THATS SO AMAZING!!!!!
@shawn_bhatia I swear, penalties will be the death of us. It's bad
Yeah, that fuckin blows... Really? <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@77DoubleJ oh wow, throwback jerseys.. That's awesome. Go Kings!!!
Meow!!!! I wonder how my cat is going to take this #catfight 
It's sad how downloading Microsoft Word for my laptop makes me really excited.. #CollegeLife
@WerewolfAndros seriously, especially when I already regretted taking this early class for my school days
@gangakris what the heck, I want one
Thank goodness my professor is always late.. Always..
@77DoubleJ haha it's on tomorrow <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS> and this time we can't just get one point, we're going to get the two points this time.
@77DoubleJ <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT> <ANGRY FACE> <UNAMUSED FACE>
@derek_ens tied 4-4 going to OT <UNAMUSED FACE>
@weather7022 seriously! This blows
This Sharks vs Capitals game... WHAT IS HAPPENING
That was flipping awesome. Beat the Sharks, Caps!!!
@AustDbishop was hoping they would keep that lead but damn, had to give Hawks that point. Glad they won in OT though
@VanCanucks Canucks choking? What else is new... Nice lead while you had It...
@VanCanucks that was awesome <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
Penguins domination!! I love this 4-0 <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@RQUINN619 meanwhile it's supposed to be mid 80's here in SoCal
Help make Valentine's Day special for patients @ChildrensLA by sending them a note 
When you look up pics of one of the cast members from your show because they're so damn hot and it gives spoilers away... FUCBSOSNDJDKF!! <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Derek_777 I agree.. But I regret it so much in the morning <PENSIVE FACE>
When you want to start the next season of your show on Netflix but you know you should get to sleep. <PENSIVE FACE>
@seanfeely80 I really like it, but frustrating how I can't keep just watching it like Netflix. Oh well
@mzvelo74 you get me..
Saved by the Bell on Netflix... <FLUSHED FACE>
Just finished both recordings of #BetterCallSaul <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> makes me want to re-watch Breaking Bad

@Mooymoney that's why it's unfortunate <WINKING FACE>
@BeardedBruin oh I will. Hopefully your Bruins pull through because I'm actually rooting for them <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@BeardedBruin people who bash Kings fans for no reason is so 2012.. Get new material, buddy.
@BeardedBruin that's all you got? 
@BeardedBruin well, definitely fooled me....
@BeardedBruin damn, you Bostonians are definitely on top of it. Congrats.
@BeardedBruin wait, so you're telling me I'm the only person to update an app a few weeks late? #MindBlown
@BeardedBruin <POUTING FACE>
@HockeyCentraI oh man <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> hopefully you reported that stupidity
Newest snapchat update removed best friends list? That's unfortunate
I know it's not 5 o'clock here yet, but there's hockey on so it's completely acceptable to be drinking wine. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><WINE GLASS>
@TheMouthLAKings @ABC7 @ABC7Rob someone is falling asleep on the job... Sad
@77DoubleJ alright, I will talk to you in 3 years about this..
@77DoubleJ oh I see, yeah i expect it to go the same way. I hope so at least!
@77DoubleJ you give him 3 years? I don't know about that.. Believe Sharks are just doing this out of respect for his retirement.
@77DoubleJ I liked Iginla as a flame and think he needs to retire as one. I'm sure you wouldn't disagree
@77DoubleJ hard to hate St. Louis though, especially when he was in Tampa. But we got him back for you against the Rags, soooo <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@77DoubleJ wow, you're kind of cool I guess. So glad to see him raise the cup for the first time. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@77DoubleJ wow, look at you. I bet you were all over Vancouver too back in 2010 right? Feel free to wear that doughty shirt anytime though <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@77DoubleJ from 2010 Olympics or with the Kings logo? Both I would approve of <WINKING FACE>
@77DoubleJ that's what I think. Such a funny way to word it, lol, but I'm at least pulling for 8th seed! We've done it before #SCChamps2012
@JeffDWarden well, at least I see some lettuce in there?
@77DoubleJ also, I think Jets will burn out soon. Kings have great prospects so no need for a huge trade like that right now.Not too worried
@77DoubleJ well that's what I meant, need one to keep losing so Kings can take their place. Kings look to be in playoff mode right now, so <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@77DoubleJ wonder when the flames will burn out.Only time will tell.At this point, I just want someone to lose so Kings can take their place
@Duke27_ just come pick me up when it's ready then <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Hahah my mom was watching part of Better Call Saul with me and she says I'm not normal for liking such violent shows.
@ajwilliams23 just finished watching my hockey team play and we won... I miss football though!
@Lhultin it really is! And it doesn't help when I'm such a competitive person
@NickMacK9 Hahha damn you!!! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
Play me on trivia crack. Username same as twitter.
@TheMouthLAKings pretty sure you would have ordered one anyways
@SaaaaveByQuick agreed. Don't want my tax paying money going to feeding that trash. <ANGRY FACE>
Alright, back to hockey now that the police chase is finished <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>. Very entertaining to say the least. Have fun in prison, don't drop the soap
@EricCooney had it coming.. Oh well
@DMJeske I was thinking the same thing! If only she was just heading to the gas station...
@EricCooney what a fucking thug. Feel bad for those people who won't get jack for their ruined cars.
@EricCooney going on a GTA chase during rush our in LA is pretty dumb haha
@LAKings it's only fair for Carter to score a goal in Lumbus
@LAKings @AlexMorgan_33 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@AlexMorgan_33 @PfefferFeff #GetOverIt
Too bad I had to miss the first Intermission because of work, I wanted to hear the Columbus fans boo after those goals <SMIRKING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> #LAKings #Lumbus
@T_Mielke11 yeah, I think I've finally got the technique for that down lol.
@BleedingBlue132 haha exactly. Would rather have too many of those then a burnt bag and smelly house from it  <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@hulk2354 blind to you?? Yeah I love that song haha, think I'm more excited for Saturday though. Pepper is one of my favorite bands
I'm so paranoid when I cook popcorn.. A few seconds too long and it's all ruined <ANGRY FACE>
Blaze n glory festival! This is so awesome, I'm going and I'll be getting a campground across from it. Can't wait <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
@nihlus @trevorlewis22 lies... I know there's a screenshot out there if if was a good hack though
@trevorlewis22 dang it!!! What was it? Curious now
I just voted for @AugieRunGood in the LA KINGS Superfan Contest! Good luck! #lakingssuperfan 
@Baseball_Life31 hahah yeppp one of the best shows <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@GiveMeInternet or how about staying inside the bike lane.. Don't get why those fuckers have to ride side by side
When he says to text him when you get home so he knows you're safe.. Then when you do, no reply #PassedOut #ThoughtThatCounts #IGuess
Can I just say this was the WEIRDEST night of hockey.. I'm sure most people can agree with me on that
Just won a beer at pool... Wooooo
@penguins WTF....
Lol... #throwback #LAKings 
@AlexMorgan_33 you should probably burn those "lucky" socks while you're at it too <WINKING FACE>
@gatorbait856 I have no more lives at the moment
#LAKings game got me like 
@JeffDWarden lol obviously
Wait, you can trash talk people you play on trivia crack?! I'm downloading it right now

@TBLightning .....but what's the score? Maybe try scoring some goals instead of trying to injure the Kings
@shawn_bhatia that was so amazing. BEST period the kings have played in a while.
That was amazing. Kings, do that two more periods. #GKG!!!!
@TheKings_Den yeah it was, I had to rewind it :(
I had to double check to make sure I was actually watching the Kings game right now.. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@TheKings_Den that was wide open!!! Grrrrr <IMP> flippin King
Go Kings Go!!! Let's bring some life back into these fans and players, we can do it. #LAKings
@k20Hudson you're my fav. Game is in an hour.. I would love to drink wine all day but I have plans later and don't want to pass out <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
It's really gloomy and crappy weather outside today, so technically I can stay inside and watch my Netflix show until hockey is on, right???
@_simplicityxo melting pot? That's the best <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD><FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD><FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@penguins 
@LAKings did someone say playoffs?! Don't tease us now
Wow, which asshole threw the #Jets jersey on the ice? They played a good game.. Fans like that shouldn't even go to games.
@77DoubleJ guess you'll never know, I am American after all... I'm clueless
@77DoubleJ the tension is high. Let the better team win <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@dmcintyre1991 I know what you're thinking about
@77DoubleJ are people in Edmonton as sensitive as you Albertans?? I'll take that as a yes #JustAJoke #GoWithIt
Go Penguins! Beat the Flames #Pens #Flames 
@penguins Perron has been so clutch
@77DoubleJ can't be friends tonight. Go Pens!!
@BauerHockey this is a little ridiculous, eh 
@Dodgers #ClaytonKershaw #FaceofMLB
Always nice to see the @Dodgers all over the baseball magazines!!! #Kershaw #Dodgers 
@jlock4820 #LAKings
Oh yeah, that's why I don't drink during the week.. Stupid work
@ChristianAllen1 I hate you
Kings loss means bottle of wine and the jacuzzi... <WINE GLASS><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Got my popcorn ready to read all these tweets about the #LAKings game....
@bloom1123 I know :( I completely forgot about that.
@JeffDWarden @LAKings my phone was hacked though... Whoops <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LAKings wow, I feel so ashamed I didn't know that. I love the Simpsons. Pretend I never tweeted that
@himynameisaldo yeah, seriously. I got blocked a few weeks ago on an NHL trash talking page for making fun of one of the admins' team..
Lmao I got blocked by NFL news and updates on FB because I called them out for stealing a meme.Fucking losers. Getting blocked a lot lately<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@lewballs22 yikesssssss
@77DoubleJ I don't know, might need to sign a salary contract if flames need me that badly
I don't want to brag or anything, but I can predict hockey scores #Flames #Sharks 
My life #hockey #cats 
@87ASandhu and he still sucks
@Lhultin yeah, being third from last in the west doesn't sound too good. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@Zellyanks lol where's the real screech? Isn't he still in jail?
@Lhultin kings not winning any games lately is probably more important than sharks winning to be honest.
@Lhultin @Thegetawayplan9 @NHL @NHLFlames @SanJoseSharks oh I know it is.. I just have a soft spot for flames lately, they're doing good
@NHL @NHLFlames @SanJoseSharks <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
@77DoubleJ lol awesome. Sorry oilers fan <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>.My Canadian sharks fan and I have a bet, I have the flames winning 3-1 tonight and so far so good
@77DoubleJ what's up with that? And not even a single tim hortons commercial. How's your oilers friend doing?
@77DoubleJ yeah, very sad. And extremely unfortunate. On a happier note, I was enjoying your Canadian commercials during intermission
@77DoubleJ yeah, I've seen a lot about this lately.. It's too bad, not just for his family but because he was a huge player for us too.
@k20Hudson I think I'll be really sad if I don't get a bobble head. So I am getting tickets
Penguins win! Fleury with the shutout.. Woooo <PENGUIN>
@77DoubleJ flames and sharks will be up there by the post season, I think they're both playing some good hockey.
Penguins just started their third period and sharks/flames game is close to puck drop. The struggle
@77DoubleJ I believe the sharks are ahead of you in the standings, but for kings sake, lose. But I'd like to see the flames win tonight
@77DoubleJ if both teams could lose tonight, that would be great. But I'd much rather see the Flames win than Sharks
So tempted to buy dodgers tickets for Clayton Kershaw bobble head night
@Chrishowrad to rt your original tweet or their rt of your rt... Hmmm
@i_Aguinaga @TheKings_Den he's so annoying, I've had him muted so he doesn't show up on my timeline <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@M_Stark11 yayyyyy me too! We get to see Stamkos <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@M_Stark11 he never posted stories so it's kind of strange he's doing them all of a sudden. Nope, not gonna fall for it lol
@shawnb_2 it's okay, you secretly love kings fans. It's kind of obvious
When you're in a fight with someone at the moment but you really want to watch their snapchat story... <UNAMUSED FACE>
@shawnb_2 @NHL you again.. Don't you have anything better to do? Like talk about Beiber?
@BeardedBruin 
@_Matt22 @NHL haha the dude must have been too many beers deep to know what was happening. Idiot
@dmcintyre1991 can't tell if this tweet was directed toward your hawks or my Kings..
@NHL the question I have, is why was their a Kings fan giving high fives after that goal.. ?
@WorldStarFunny da billllssss
Sometimes I hate you, 4pm Kings games. #GoKingsGo
@77DoubleJ hah yep, like I get the ducks feed here as well. I don't care to watch those games usually unless nobody else is playing.
@77DoubleJ nope, I don't follow oilers hockey very well. I'll be lucky if I can watch a few games beside my Kings games during the week
@77DoubleJ funny how the sharks work though. They'll beat Kings, Ducks and Chicago but struggle against the Oilers
@77DoubleJ haha so negative. Oilers can play like they're not the worst team in the league when they want to.
@Thegetawayplan9 Hahahh good one <OK HAND SIGN>
@Thegetawayplan9 yeah, kings couldn't have lasted till round 12 that's for sure
@Thegetawayplan9 I'm not even mad anymore, that shootout was very entertaining
@77DoubleJ damn you, lol gamecenter lags a minute so I wasn't surprised when they scored <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@77DoubleJ I don't know, this is a pretty intense and fun shootout.
@77DoubleJ that's true, just would have been nice if they could do something right for once. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@TedGanas yep! Watching it at the moment <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Damn it, Oilers, you had one job.. Couldn't just hold that lead against the Sharks could you? <UNAMUSED FACE>
I look forward to my @TheHockeyNews magazines <WINKING FACE> 
Going home from work and writing a paper is definitely not how I wanted to spend tonight <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Jonas_Hoglund that's a tad creepy
#sixmoreweeksofwinter sounds nice and all, but there is no winter in California #trueStory
@JDStylz_ our day will come soon, Jeff!
Good, because I fuxking hate you anyways @TomBradysEgo 
@Thegetawayplan9 lol yeah, whenever some dumbass does that they don't win!
Ready for September because Bills will be 2016 Super Bowl champs...


@IMoochy both teams are classless, who fuckin cares.
@AlexMorgan_33 pretty sure he swings the other way
@IMoochy I hate both teams. And you don't know what was said between players, I bet gronk said something out of line
@NFLonFOX sorry we cheated and shouldn't have even been in the Super Bowl, good game though
Let's just say that if a patriots fan walked by me right now I would attack him. #cheaters #bandwagon
@OhThatGuy87 Disneyland here in California
@IMoochy I hated both teams with a passion, but since it's against the rules to root for the pats since I'm a bills fan, it was all hawks
@OhThatGuy87 disneyWORLD.. In Florida. , come on buddy
Patriots bandwagon is completely at capacity, let's just put it like that...
"IM GOING TO DISNEYWORLD!!!!" Do they still say that??
Wow. Everyone is super pissed right now expect for like two patriots fans but they shouldn't have been invited in the first place
Go Seahawks!!! I hate you Patriots
Lots of jerseys at this Super Bowl party.. But my mom and I are representing the Bills Mafia <PARTY POPPER><RELIEVED FACE> #SB49
My really awesome beer koozie #SB49 
Robin is a nucks fan #HowIMetYourMother 
@derek_ens not a fan of either team
@Prevail2012 lots and lots of beer
Drinking water while boozing it up is probably the best thing you can do. I feel good today! Now time to get wasted because of stupid #SB49
@ChristianAllen1 @AJEllis17 they played that song today??
@edna94 @TaylorAnhaeuser exactly !!!
@TaylorAnhaeuser I really laughed at this lol
Fuxking A stupid rat
@GoalKingsGoal thank you.. I see you too
@ChristianAllen1 I knew you would like that <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@ChristianAllen1 I'm actually going to the watch party today since I live right by it.. So I couldn't have gone anyways :P #FuckMattingly
@Aesth3tik @JeffDWarden lol good point
@Jer4Kings wow! So worth it though, very cool
@TheKings_Den a lot of Fans of Canadian teams go to away games since it's so much cheaper. And Seattle being closest to the border Who knows
@TheKings_Den @derek_ens do you know how many Vancouver fans would come down there for games.. No doubt they'd make a profit
@derek_ens @TheKings_Den there needs to be one more to make it even, not sure where they'll put that second one but Seattle for sure
@TheKings_Den but Vegas would be a lot of fun to visit for games. I think once during summer would be enough for me though
@TheKings_Den I think it would ruin the whole fun of frozen fury for us though
@JeffDWarden my body is glued to the bed now that I laid now. Don't think thats gonna happen
I really want to go out tonight but I'm also really tired from my workout.. I don't know what to doooo
@toffolicannoli this is so frustrating.. What the hell
@toffolicannoli shut the fuck up
@Thegetawayplan9 no, no, I understand. Thank you soooo much for putting me in my place
@Thegetawayplan9 ohhh, now we're bringing facts into this. Okay
@Thegetawayplan9 well as long as YOU think so I'm sure it must be funnier
@Thegetawayplan9 I'll have to check out the original one, you'll have to excuse my horrible taste in movies
@Thegetawayplan9 why so negative huh
I get to watch Death at a Funeral at work and I'm so happy. Such a funny movie. Also, #TGIF <PARTY POPPER>
Yeah, no. 
I don't remember the last time I went to bed this early.. Much needed rest <SLEEPING FACE>
@nflnetwork @katyperry #NoneOfTheAbove
@shawnb_2 @camtheman113 @LAKings @dj_hockey18 you guys are fighting about Beiber..
@shawnb_2 @camtheman113 @LAKings @dj_hockey18 yeah, looks photoshopped. At least he's smart enough not to degrade himself by wearing that <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
Proud nerd 
Really tempted to get a Star Wars backpack or not.
@LAKings @dj_hockey18 HAHAHAH Kings twitter is killing it tonight. Keep it going
@LAKings @Tropicalmango25 mango, quit being a fucking sore loser.
God bless you All-Star break. #LAKings with a well deserved win that's for sure.
OH MY QUICK
Welcome back Toffoli!!!
This is such a good game!! Huge 3rd period coming up. Let's go Kings!
@DanielDossey don't be one of those people!
I would love to see this tonight #LAKings 
So I expect a few goals from Doughty tonight since he enjoys spending his time in the sin bin. Make it happen <IMP>
THANK YOU CARTER <PURPLE HEART>

“@LAKings: #LAKvsCHI 
@mzvelo74 kings vs hawks right now.. How are you surviving?!
@mzvelo74 good observation there, bud lol
@Lhultin @EricCooney eww, that's a definite jersey foul alright
@ragland03 no, there were actually a lot of Bills fans in Oakland!
Someone tell them there's more than just Kane and Toews on their team
Ewww, hawks fans taking over LA. This should not be happening <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> #GoKingsGo 
I hate both teams playing in #SB49, so I think I'm just going to bet $$ if Katy Perry will have a wardrobe malfunction or not.
@AlexMorgan_33 yep <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> well I refuse to give them my views dammit!
@AlexMorgan_33 no lol. Haven't checked twitter TL this morning, I saw like 5 on Facebook though. What the heck!
Why are so many Super Bowl commercials being released before the game? Kind of ruins the surprise of them
“@imseanavery: Why didn't they ask #Marty's wife to be on #HockeyWives”

<SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>

Vegas in the summer or a roach trip to see the kings vs sharks stadium series. I'm stuck here <PENSIVE FACE>
@simplemanbrook whiskey <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> and I'm no whiskey drinker
Who knew snapchat could get you into so much trouble <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@AlexMorgan_33 wherever he ends up, Carter will be there soon enough <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RaNels59 awww thank you! It was just the small bottles that we could sneak in which would be easier. Last min idea
Screw you @Crackle for your stupid adds.. You're so lucky you have Seinfeld or you wouldn't have my business <ANGRY FACE>
@77DoubleJ haha we had fun Singing especially when you're drunk
@77DoubleJ haha it helps when you're with 4 girlfriends signing it haha
@ChristianAllen1 something ZBB or red solo cup by Toby Keith which we will be singing for sure, just too nervous to sign up yet
Really nervous to sing some karaoke.. Need more booze
I don't normally go out on a Sunday night since work early the next morning, but this is kind of a big deal
@dmcintyre1991 I've heard WWE has gone downhill the past few years from people, so I believe you
@pucktacular stick tap to that, way to go Ovi

That was a fun All Stars weekend, I got to catch up on my sleep during that game. I miss my LA Kings hockey though
The home all-star jerseys are starting to grow on me.. I actually like them #TeamFoligno
@Lhultin exactly what I was thinking. I don't like when people put their own twist on the national anthem <UNAMUSED FACE>
I'm just going to pretend I didn't see the opening of the all star game. Go team Foligno
Yikes. This is cheesy.. Let's just get to scoring #NHLAllStar2015
Hi, my names Danica and I hate Patriots fans.
Sneaking booze &amp; snacks in the movie theatre <WINKING FACE> 
Only 6:30?? I feel like I should finally get out of bed and do something..
Went outside and almost got blown away it's so windy.. I do not appreciate that, Mother Nature
#NHLBreakawayJohansen #TeamFoligno
@HMLband I have no idea! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
All star skills competition yeaaaahhhhhh <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
When you have a party and this is on your bed in the morning.. Lol what? 
Finally paying one of my favorite bouncers for a bet I did on the raiders/bills game.. THANKS BUFFALO <ANGRY FACE>
@TheMouthLAKings you're so famous

#NHLAllStarDraft
@77DoubleJ it's on buddy
@77DoubleJ I agree to disagree. Home jersey baby #TeamFoligno
My three favorite things in one picture, sadly. #Hockey #alcohol #Cats 
One of the funniest moments on the #NHLFantasyDraft 
So glad team Foligno is the black/green.. So much easier on the eyes than the white/green ones. #NHLFantasyDraft
Who wants to get Ovi-wasted with me tonight? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
I'm so excited to try this stuff out #TGIF #Shocktop 
@44Chavito lol could you tell
@Hollyhoodaims it's just stupid to cheat, especially in a game like that. They still would have won by a lot if the balls were normal
@Hollyhoodaims sarcasm lol. Yeah, I must be late in the game because I finally just heard it today
@Hollyhoodaims what are you talking about, I'm the first one to say this joke...
The best thing about dating a Patriots fan is that they don't care if you cheat #DeflateGate
#MakeSexAwkwardIn5Words 
My cat always watches though..
Ohhh this is sick 


@LAKings @Eliza_Eaton @Rilgon @LocksTheFox jeez chill out over a flipping joke. You started it so quit complaining
@LAKings wait, are you guys in Columbus?! Woooahhhh
@M_Stark11hah yep, whenever I hang with my best friend after work it's like 11. It sucks
FRIDAY!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

10pm.. You know what that means!!! #Seinfeld
@DMJeske 
@DMJeske slap it! Seriously
@M_Stark11 LMAO what did this person do now?! I know exactly who you're talking about <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@jlock4820 that is so true <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Toy story 3 in bed <WINKING FACE> #Relaxing 
@NOT_Milan_Lucic goodnight <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I have no morning classes tomorrow so I'm just drinking and watching Pulp Fiction. I'm so cool, I know
@DrGirlfriend311 exactly!!! Lol
@TrueBlueLowry21 exactly. But at least give me a warning if you have a problem with me. Goes to show how weak sharks fans are
@TrueBlueLowry21 such a flippin joke, it's literally a "Trash talking" page &amp; some Sharts fan admin got all sensitive with what I was sayin
LMAO you know you won when you get blocked from the FB NHL trash talkers page.. Sensitive Sharks fans!!!!
Some of my favorite things <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> and <BEER MUG><BEER MUG> 
@OGPimpbot I love you so much for that
@ChirpTheDusters lol way to go, Paul! I'm guessing he'll be a no-show at that end of the season pizza party
@ChirpTheDusters I honestly just spat out my beer when I watched this
@TrueBlueLowry21 haha yeah, such a comedian I know <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Btw guys, today I became kind of famous so yeah #TopComment 
@Mooymoney sarcasm, much definitely
LOL yeah, let me stick around and listen to Mike Milbury after this stupid loss. Will make my night much better <UNAMUSED FACE>
LA with the "rare" power play. Sharks announcers even said it like that. Jeez, this game is a joke
Burns, go back to roaming through the forests or something you flipping Sasquatch
@Lhultin when they brought up the Stanley cup moments, I couldn't hate any longer
@Lhultin I have to agree with you on that
@BleedingBlue132 yeah, he's been great tonight. It's too bad :(
@SpamAvocado So I'll be bugging you Saturday then??
I've noticed they've been playing a LOT of Foo Fighters music at SAP center. Props to that
@SpamAvocado still waiting to see if they're playing stadium series....
@dmcintyre1991 go to bed, Dan!!!
@SpamAvocado "some members" <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
@nihlus @LA_hockey_chick haha I just became a superstar a few months ago. I feel so cool! Take notes, @StubHub
@LA_hockey_chick lmaooo I wish.. I know it's just 10 bucks but that can add up <MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG>
@LA_hockey_chick <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> yeah, omg. If you spend a certain amount you always get like 10 bucks back. It's frequent too on how much $$ you spend
@CujoKnows I'm a big Metallica fan, I can't hang
@jjpix13 right herrrreeeeee 
@M_Stark11 @LA_hockey_chick that, and if you spend a certain amount you get money back. And they give you BDAY perks <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Breaks my heart to see some members of Metallica supporting the Sharks <BROKEN HEART> whyyyy
@derek_ens that was a great game Edmonton though huh
@M_Stark11 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@LA_hockey_chick let's just say @StubHub has reimbursed me a lot from what I spent <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Most of my money goes toward Kings games and I'm not even mad #LAKings @M_Stark11 
@JayTeeW311 Lavine??
Check out the Flames/Ducks game between intermission. It's getting better..
@JayTeeW311 lol alright. Take care and go Kings <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@LAKings NO!?!?! When did someone say that?! I'm baffled
@JayTeeW311 @BleedingBlue132 lol is it because we have warm temps all year round and don't have much snow? Don't be one of those people <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I honestly think the only chant the Sharks fans know is "Beat LA"
@dmcintyre1991 can't trust you anymore. I see how it is
@dmcintyre1991 I hate you 
@77DoubleJ good luck! (not really, Kings need the points more than you so it's okay to lose tonight)
@77DoubleJ Ducks are a great team, but starting Ortio was a great decision despite what the scoreboard says right now.
@77DoubleJ I started to watch the flames game and they scored. You're welcome. I'll watch this game between the Kings intermissions
@77DoubleJ haha holyyyyyy... 4-0. If only Hiller would have started, jeez. Good luck with that one <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@LAKings: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Cliffy, always first to drop the gloves... #LAKings
@PeteyBeats hate the ducks, but I approve of that sign
@dmcintyre1991 I know, hoping for something cool to happen.. Doubt it though
@LAKings I'm seeing way too many mullets in this picture though..
Shit, we have 60 minutes of listening to these bozo announcers... Go Kings Go
@dmcintyre1991 liessssss..
@dmcintyre1991 I already know what your snapchat is going to be and I ain't lookin at it
@mzvelo74 congrats, I just saw that. Let me go throw up now
SHOOTOUTTTTT!!!! Go Penguins. (Meanwhile, listening to Kings radio...)
@LAKings preferably the a penguins
@yamanboo I like to live dangerously
FUTURE GOALS:

“@penguins: Congratulations to C.J. and Megan! They got engaged in front of Iceburgh earlier tonight 
Dammit penguins, get your clock together
@dmcintyre1991 false
@penguins that looked like a hawks PP.. Jeez penguins, get it together
Dustin knew I would drink all the alcohol at the party during this game, I don't blame him <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C> #BYOB #Lame 
So excited that this will be my first year at @WonderCon! Now I just have to figure out costumes <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #Nerd @M_Stark11
@WerewolfAndros @DarylEvans15 @JDStylz_ @JimFox19 @FreddyO22 #GoKingsGo !!!
@pucktacular even if that is a joke, who says that???
@ChristianAllen1 yes you did, and so did penguins.
@ChristianAllen1 this just in: flyers still suck
@thatgoalie13 you'll love it here those two months :P stupid, disgusting flyers..
@NicoleMae11 agreed.. Lots of muting people tonight <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
My mom walks in on me watching hockey and says: "oh, are they having playoffs now?" SMH, where did she even get that from
@NHL where's Carcillo though?? Oh...
@thatgoalie13 why are you coming to Cali? And yeah, this is probably friendliest I've been to a flyers fan during a game in a while <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@EngellandsEye bahaha your tweets are on point tonight. Can't get enough of them
@thatgoalie13 alright, I guess I should respect that <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@thatgoalie13 it's okay, just switch teams and you won't be one <OK HAND SIGN>
@thatgoalie13 hahah definitely don't. And I especially didn't do it enough to know that terminology either!!
@thatgoalie13 hahah "had my fair share" as in mainly drinking that before turning 21. Pfft
@thatgoalie13 lmaoooo I've had my fair share of being classy like that
@thatgoalie13 nasty light and pee stone are so similar lol and I'm so ashamed I know that
Shortyyyyyyy #Penguins
@thatgoalie13 the only time I'll drink one is if I'm shotgunning it..
@thatgoalie13 man, I'm in the mood for a nice cold Keystone light #SaidNoOneEver
@thatgoalie13 low blow lol it's okay, I don't really expect anything else from a flyers fan.. (Okay, I'm done<SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>)
@NHL but where's the cup?
@thatgoalie13 woah, gotta bring Quick into this now? At least he will be waving to your flyers when we're in the playoffs
@thatgoalie13 I don't really get why you have a shitty beer in it though, what's the reason behind it?
@TheMouthLAKings @CarBombBoom13 @RinaldoZac I had to RT and favorite

FV for Rinaldo
@BrauckObama flyers are a bunch of useless goons <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@thatgoalie13 I don't know about that, your choice of RT's are questionable as well
@thatgoalie13 thinking tweets have to be high quality...
@thatgoalie13 lmao, you must be new to twitter
I hate when games are in Philly, that's such an awful orange color. With that being said, go Penguins
@77DoubleJ yeah, deserved that's for sure. Wonder if they'll make a perfect Cali trip or not.. We shall see <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Steph_Sampson color is my favourite way to spell it
@Steph_Sampson well you Canadians need more time learning, so that doesn't surprise me
Is the school semester almost over?? Ugh
@77DoubleJ ah that's true, that's what I meant. Too tired, my bad #Excuses
@77DoubleJ haha thank you <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> prepare to be chirped tomorrow if it's a complete spanking from the ducks though
@77DoubleJ yeah, like I said, playing some good hockey right now. Good luck you guys
@77DoubleJ won't be surprised about an Ortio start, but it deff would be a slap in the face if Hiller won there. I would approve of that
