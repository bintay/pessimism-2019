@Ladylake2004 when did I say that? UKIP wants doctors from India rather than unskilled from EU You're making it up
@Ladylake2004 UKIP believes in *age appropriate* sex education, UKIP sacks homophobes and racists..broaden your reading.

@Independent The clue is in the word 'discreet'...breasts aren't just for babies!
@Independent It hasn't...wishful thinking by the establishment!

Ten Reasons Why Evan Davis's BBC Interview With Nigel Farage Was The Worst Thing Ever - Breitbart 
@daily_politics @NickyMorgan01 @afneil UKIP Jonathan Arnott...maths guru and chess champion, made them all look like educational pigmies.
@Independent is this Great Britain or the depths of ISIS territory?
@afneil Well done Andrew, no airy fairy ideology from LibLabGreenCon, trust the maths expert -only Policy that's costed!
@afneil be even handed as 'nearly' always, don't take ideology, look at facts!
@maturefinancier @MargotLJParker @Battsby @barlowmullers

@JonathanArnott @labourpress dirty tricks...but look at them...
 Vote UKIP Scotland it is as simple as that
@NigelFarageNews well they're part of the Commonwealth like India, shared history, fought together, what Britain wouldn't!
@DailyMirror could be worse! 

@NigelFarageNews nice try - more babies born to foreign mothers than British ones in London, South East 4th densely populated in the world
@Independent @y_alibhai dump the MP!
@SkyNews UKIP support strengthening...Polls politically skewed!
#dailypolitics Robert Peston showing his true Lefty colours, keep BBC EU grants at any costs pointless hyperbole!
@RobbieGibb @daily_politics only smears from LibLabConSnipes...what's new.  UKIP's policies verified!
#dailypolitics here we go again, the 'LibLabConSnipes' can only try to smear UKIP - Big corps/cheap labour/no corp tax!
#VictoriaLIVE Farage didn't say it was 'easy' and didn't talk about 'benefits'!
#VictoriaLIVE I paid ALL my fees through the OU. Students now on £35,000 a year, they only pay back £75 a month!
#VictoriaLIVE give it a rest, your Lefty bias is showing!
#VictoriaLIVE Farage said send out the Royal Navy to save them..EU useless.  Send most back...or expect millions more!
#VictoriaLIVE Farage is right, it's what Australia did, and now very few attempt to get there illegally - EU/UK to blame
#LorraineKelly listen Lorraine! UKIP wants an even open playing field with the rest of the world, not EU rule!
Exclusive: Huge surge in support for Ukip after £1.7bn EU funding row 
@SunNation @TheSunNewspaper 'Single European sky crucial for EU prosperity'. EU Parliamentary magazine...this is getting ridiculous hahaha!
#dailypolitics UKIP want no tax or NI on minimum wage...bias again!
@Jen_Conway @prwhittle @BBCLondonNews Has the electoral commission sorted out the gerrymandering in Tower Hamlets yet?
@UKIP @oflynnmep Good luck both of you, you're putting the others to shame...Housing, Pensions, Health, Environment, Defence....
@UKIP @daily_politics @RogerHelmerMEP yet again, UKIP tells the truth, Miliband stuffed up and the EU exacerbated the problem.
@MartinDaubney Sturgeon only represents 45% of Scotland (2 million)and is NOT a UK MP, why is she given so much airtime?
@UKIP @Nigel_Farage @absoluteradio Funny, honest, sincere...no script, no SPADS, brilliant!
#sundaypolitics here we go again, twisting the issue of immigration It's 'uncontrolled immigration straining our services, undermining wages
Shame on LibLabCon 
Stuart Rose tells Lord Levy that Labour is scare mongering about the consequences of EU exit!  Who care about Tesco!
@KayBurley why is the BBC giving her air time, she's not standing for Westminster!
@NigelFarageNews written by an ignorant LibDem supporter as a spoiler!
@skystephen Ed Davy (leafy Surbiton - MP) approved over a hundred ugly wind turbines off our Sussex coast...yuk!
@skystephen How can we train 'enough' doctors if we've no idea what the demand will be from year to year?
@UKIP @Nigel_Farage fantastic job, Housing Policy and Pensions approved by leaders in their professions...LibLabCon...&gt; nothing!
#skygillian £8,000+ per pupil in London, £4,000 in Merseyside.  White boys from poor families do worst.
@BBCPolitics @BBCNews Labour Policy on Immigration, 'more pay, more homes, more doctors,more school places for free', that should deter them
#bbcnews London gets twice the amount per pupil than Merseyside.  Additional help, ethnic minority weekend schools, EFL etc!
#skygillian it's NOT a output benefits, Kent prison is overflowing with Polish criminals we can't send back.
#sky Stephen ask Cooper how many EU migrants are being exploited?
#skygillian Cooper is not answering the question...reduce by HOW MUCH?
#sky stephen ask Cooper how many migrants have been found to be exploited from the EU?
#skygillian Yasmin needs to study psychology, would she choose a partner wearing a balaclava!
#skygillian improving working conditions for immigrants from the EU is hardly going to deter them, most are here legally and not exploited.
#skygillian NHS workers need a 'good' standard of English, not merely a 'basic' one!
#skygillian Seeing a difference between marriage and 'Civil Partnerships' is not homophobic; gay discrimination is both illegal &amp; immoral.
Signature surge, Bias BBC &amp; update 
@AngrySalmond Regional accents (except Yorkshire, Lancashire, Brum, West Country, Cockney, Essex...) are beginning to grate!
RCS - UKIP - "this raft of policies is the first real programme of this campaign that seeks to solve Britain’s long-term supply-side crisis"
#skygillian actual BBC online Poll Farage 43%, Sturgeon 29, Miliband 21, Bennett 4, Wood 3... Says it all really, Farage is right!
@Nigel_Farage actual BBC online results:-
Nigel 43%, Sturgeon 29%, Miliband 21%, Bennett 4%, Wood 3%,these aren't in headlines!
#BBCdebate
#BBCDebate vote UKIP...Believe in Britain!
#BBCDebate Nigel's won the day with the viewers...facts vs fairy tales!
@BBCPolitics I see the BBC sides with far Left .. No surprise there then!
#BBCdebate
@thei100 @Independent yeh, he's right!
@Telegraph nigel Farage by far the strongest on the panel..States the truth despite wonky audience!
@afneil Sturgeon is dangerous, we love the Scots, but make an exception where she's concerned!
#…
#BBCdebate
@SkyNews yes, stop lying Miliband!
@bbclaurak like 2010 Labour manifesto promoting an Australian style immigration system 'not rising unemployment'
@Independent Bennett most positive hahahaha...5% in the polls.
#BBCdebate
@thei100 @Independent Gary stop eating the crisps, you're not listening!
@Channel4News Nigel is in favour of 'Controlled' immigration ... Chosen by British, not NO immigration.
@SkyNews so Bennett wants one rule for those outside the EU, and no rules for EU...IRONIC
@SkyNews Leanne Wood needs to open her lug holes and stop twisting UKIP Policy...is she thick?
@SkyNews what's being an immigrant got to do with the price of bread.  UKIP loves immigrants, but the right ones and the right quantity!
@SkyNews airy fairy, fairy tales from Green, Plaid and Nats ...audience boo those most representing UK ... Funny that!
@SkyNews Nigel Farage hits the nose on the head with viewers!
I think #NigelFarage is winning tonight's #GE2015 debate #SkyNewsPoll What do you think? 
@UKIP @Nigel_Farage he's right and the only one who knows the EU and those in it!
@Jo_Coburn @daily_politics yes Jo, shows how balanced the so-called balanced audience.
@SkyNews no, and he let too many in, too quickly!
@bbclaurak yeh they would Laura, they're all from the 5% in the polls...and Sturgeon doesn't represent the majority of the UK.
@Independent hilarious, 5% in polls!
@Channel4News why not when lowest on Polls gets loudest cheer!
@bbclaurak haha...even handed socialist remark!
@KayBurley well it's no surprise, the speaker bottom of the polls gets the loudest cheer!!
@afneil and he's right!
#BBCDebate only Nigel Farage talks sense, the demand is outstripping any possible plan for building.
#BBCDebate  Nige, you're the ONLY one that's answered the question...don't want my grandchildren paying today's debt or de old of democracy.
Go Nige, you're the only one with a credible plan.
Flippin' 'eck, spend, spend, spend...but other people's taxes!
Natalie Bonkers Bennett, say no more!
Sturgeon, what's she doing on our screens, she's not even standing as an MP...LET HER RAISE Scottish taxes, no more Barnett formula.
Miliband...promises promises...but his nose is stuffed up, like his manifesto, no mention of EU or immigration!
Nigel Farage...brilliant, someone who knows how to balance the books and stick up for Britain...go Nige!
Leanne Wood...nice person, but hopeless at house-keeping!
@thetimes @montie well, vote UKIP then ... Believe in Britain!
#BBCDebate go Nigel, Manifesto was brilliant, and properly costed!<GRINNING FACE><THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Michael_Heaver hahaha...pull the other one Mick!
Fantastic poster...we want one on the pier in Eastbourne!
Natalie Bennett...naive, historically/economically ignorant and worse of all, her voice is beginning to grate!
Sickening deference to Sturgeon...yuk!
Tonight's Agenda showed sickening deference to Sturgeon...yuk!
Miliband's 2010 Manifesto - 'We need an Australian style immigration policy not rising unemployment'..BUT only for all those outside the EU
#BBCAskThis Ummuna: will your costings for the NHS cover the current black hole in their finances, and the increase in population over 5 yrs
Jack Dromey (Harriet's ol' man)...yawn!!!


Believe in Britain!
@UKIP @DianeJamesMEP @LBC LibLabCon still trying to slur UKIP...the public know better!
Well done Andrew Neil, you exposed the SNP for the hypocrites they are - Sturgeon doesn't want Trident but is happy to join NATO!
