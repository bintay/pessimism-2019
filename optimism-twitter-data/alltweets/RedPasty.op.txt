I sold 34 games to gamestop and for the first time in my life they didn't screw me over
@AlecisBr00tal by not bringing in the controller the value somehow drops to $10
$10...GameStop offered me $10 for my ps3
Time to see how much gamestop will lowball me for all of this 
There's no point in constantly being an asshole and acting childish for no reason
If there's one thing that Trailer Park Boys has taught me, it's that I don't need my grade 12.
