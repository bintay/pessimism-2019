Minor caveat. It is my opinion.. I have a few people who tend to get offended at my opinion. To thee I say " scroll over quietly "
So if you say " United spent £150 million to get to top 4 " 

Empirical evidence suggests otherwise
Shit. I forgot Carrick. He and De Gear probably have the most impact in our league position
"@MySolskjaer: @kennagq Rojo was pretty good start of season too, shame about the injuries"

Yeah. I'm measuring appearances + form
People instrumental in top 4 IMHO 

Young, De Gea, Felliani, Rooney, Mata , ( Herrera ) and Smalling and  Valencia
Herrera - didn't start much in the first part
Blind - Probably the only consistent signing
Di Maria - injured and off form
Shaw - injured for 70% of campaign
Rojo - Mostly injured
Falcao - Are u having  a laugh?
Top 4 attained with Improved players from Moyes era. 
You can't say it is because of new signings. 

Because it isn't

Nope. I still follow u
@mufc4thefans you need players who can invoke another gear and win you games with sheer individual brilliance . like RVP in 2013
@mufc4thefans not enough leaders. Not enough people ( if any at all) who can switch to another gear . look at messi vs Bayern
"@mufc4thefans: @kennagq but for 3 games? That is what you call a bad team if that's the case"

Unbalanced more like
@mufc4thefans we seem to perform when stakes are high.
@mufc4thefans I think our players felt too assured about qualification after winning 5 on the bounce. They switched off literally
If we don't beat palace , we deserve whatever our fate it at the end of the season
But I bet Everton see how it feels to play all the football and lose terribly. They thought it was ' strategy '
We really are shit. Everton losing 2-0 at home

Depay is already a fan favorite. Wonder why people like him so much
Good to see Liverpool bouncing back from the depay fiasco by trying to sign the Yorkshire Figo.

@brighante you know nani has more medals than the entire arsenal team right?
"@brighante: “@kennagq: He's not the new hazard or ronaldo .”

New Nani?"

Nani has 2-3 EPLs and champions league. 

More than le goon.
He's not the new hazard or ronaldo .He's just a talented dutch kid we hope will do well.
Like a Brendan Rodgers quote , They have a way of coming back to bite you in the ass
Just gonna accept Mr Memphis and wish him the best. No need dragging him into any " RT for Depay Fav for Xyz " Bullcrap

Liverpool quality
Liverpool were in champions league and signed Lallana and Lambert. 

Without it they may have to settle for charlie Adam and lee cattermole

Correlation factor = 0%
Wonder how many players Liverpool has picked up their transportation tab and yet failed to sign. Their body count may be in double digits
Well depay is actually close to Liverpool. 

Geographically. With Manchester united

Today, LFC fans: Massively overrated…
Ronaldo was also thought overrated. If it means anything in context

This might sound crazy but I think he's worth slightly less" £40m …


Our YouTube consultant on depay
"@Nigerianscamsss: @kennagq they've already started"

Will they ever NOT be predictable?
We sign players. They help us rate them. 

Fair enough
@Chopsy__ @KvG___ Messi scored 1 goal each game vs united. Scored 4 in a match vs arsenal. I don't see how both  scenarios  are comparable
" Depay is overrated " in 4,3,2,1
@Carzado lol Pardew is sipping expired orijin. Nobody will pay over 15 million for bolasie. Talk less of 40
We might not have to wait for young then. Doesn't get more official than that

@Chopsy__ @KvG___ there's no point. We are highlighting games where messi delivered a near perfect performance. That's definitely one

Lewandowski
Get players in early. Get them a good pre season. That was what we missed with Di Maria.
"@mufc4thefans: @kennagq credit to young though in fairness he done a job this year when others flopped on it"

Earned his contract
Now we gotta hawk our average  players like ukwa and aki
Add clyne and a CF and sell a few players. Net spend could be about £65 million. 

I reiterate. Wouldnt be bad
Gundogan Depay and hummels could be signed for about £70 mil.  Wouldn't be bad business ( would be fantastic).
Woodward on fleek. And steroids.
Depay or not Depay. 

Depay, it seems. 

Till young confirms otherwise
I'll wait for young to confirm this depay transfer before it is official. 

As I always do
Always good to snatch a transfer from the clutches of Liverpool.
Seems we have ' sallahed' Liverpool with the depay transfer. 

They thought it was his dream to play under Rodgers , in Europa, at anfield
@VickieOfficiel Harry Kane ( Recent  youth player) , Costa ( la liga export). Messi head and shoulders better than both. Not even debatable
@VickieOfficiel if Harry Kane and Costa can be EPL top scorers, messi will definitely Rule EPL scoring charts. No doubt

LMFAO…
Creepy females on FB always asking " How are you" 

Where do they pop up from?
"@__gershom: @kennagq LOL. 5 players per playing position. Minus Messi and Ronaldo"

I'd need a few days. I know too many good footballers.
@VickieOfficiel They say he will struggle vs stoke. It seems stoke city is tougher than Bayern. Assuming you believe twitter
@__gershom Ronaldo de Lima. Messi.ronaldinho Maldini. Nesta. Buffon. Cafu. Scholes. Figo. Giggs. 

Honorable mention to Cronaldo Schmeichel
The way evra pocketed bale. Is that guy really worth £100 mil? I mean he's good but can he deliver week in/ out
@yommyhero The difference is average - decent players play 90 mins at an even tempo. World class players turn it up at critical moments
@IamRashman Halilovic is good but I'm not sure he will hit the messi heights. I can almost rule it out

Nope.

Let's see who we've produced so far. In recent time. 

Cleverley , welbeck, Evans, Januzaj, Wilson

Not quite world class. Not nearly
I'm just looking at our academy products. 

Na, no messi in there. You can safely rule that out.
"@jackdre02: @kennagq but Messi was already established in that team before pep. He was just not scoring enough"

Pep gave him center stage
"@effalixumab: Bayern Munich failed to have a shot on target for the first time since 2009"
.they were out tiki taka'ed
I'll always respect Pep for nurturing messi. We would never have seen him assuming he had no faith in youth
Need to give youth a chance. Somewhere out there is a messi that never got the chance to play . And burnt out
Messi took arsenal to church.  To church fam. Collected their offering money. Prayed for them and sent them packing
"@Em_Mozay: @kennagq @Ahman__ And Whole of Arsenal &amp; City"

4 goals vs arsenal. Yet they say he will struggle in the EPL
Probably the match that settled the debate once and for all. The magical hobbit destroys the best coach and Keeper like it is child's play
"@Em_Mozay: @kennagq @Ahman__ This is normal for him, we've seen what he did to R. Carlos"

And marcelo. And nani
Messi is other players best players. You can argue about whose better all you want. But no player makes other players gasp like him
Zaha would have done 20 legovers in the time it took messi to do one simple fake
Best dribbler on the planet in my estimation. I said this long before he destroyed boateng
Messi dribbles. So stainless. No need for 500 legovers .. One fake and a swift move. That's all

No he doesn't
Life without a TV isn't that bad tbh
Finally might have to buy a TV
@Nattie_Best I'm ok with not producing English talent. I'm not English, why would it bother me

highlights with Martin tyler and gary Neville. Doesnt get better
@shanemufc20 I'm hopeful and optimistic , we will get there.
In a normal world , after 4 years at united Jones should be a properly seasoned CB. But we are still saying ' potential' and ' maybe '
@shanemufc20 yeah. I'm just hoping on stability not really a blaze of glory from LVG. Just a proper foundation
Not players like obertan and Valencia . Category C players that wouldn't start in a mid level la liga team.
We were set back by at least 5 years with that. But the future looks bright. We are linked with the right calibre of players now
Hopefully LVG sets the foundation for PROPER succession .Not that shambolic change of guard from fergie to Moyes
We just filled our squad with average players and hoped Moyes would be some sort of fergie clone. 

Worked a treat innit?
That's why you need to buy QUALITY players so when in transition they can bridge the gap without a total collapse
Barcelona is well oiled machine. 3 managers later - barely any difference. We swapped fergie for Moyes and collapsed
Let me watch the match .  Now I have free time.  Let me see some messi magic

Took pogba one season to run things at juve . Jones still dey cross make U21 striker score. 

I just tire
Jones won't stay fit. And when he's fit he will be injuring our players in training. I just tire. Four years. Zero progress.
"@Mark_Kunta: @kennagq Jones a year older"

Exactly. But Varane is ahead in development + fitness. By a country mile

0 shots
0 chances created
0 successful crosses
100% shite 
Jones is still young. Lol. Isn't he older than Varane?
"@YouMataToMe: @kennagq ended up? He's only 23.."

He's had FOUR seasons at united. You can draw some conclusions
We thought jones would be a tough tackling battle ready no nonsense defender.  We just signed vermaelens cousin tbh.  Biscuit boned
Chellini is what we thought jones would be. 

Vermaelen is what he ended up being

Mobaxterm has all that
@ToluBablo do an ls -ltrh and find out the account that created the file, permissions and log in as root, su as the account and delete it

If root cannot delete files bcz of insufficient permissions, I've been learning this Linux bus…
@ToluBablo well some not all.
@ToluBablo at my job you just can't log in as root anyhow , you'll be questioned . That's sysadmin realm. My user account has root priv
@ToluBablo also , in case you're looking for a good client to use , download mobaxterm - fantastic ssh client . free as well
@ToluBablo lol I can count on my fingers the no of times I've logged in as root. It absolutely terrifies me.
@ToluBablo someone got fired cos he logged in as root and shutdown a live production server. There was no begging on that one
@ToluBablo yeah. But you wanna have a seperate account with root privilege. Not as powerful as root.
@ToluBablo like a sysadmin account with root privileges. Create an account , vi /etc/sudoers file and add the account
@ToluBablo also , be careful logging in as root to delete files. Very dangerous . You should have an account dedicated for that
@ToluBablo some files can actually only be deleted by the account that created them. Some setting in the file creation

@NadeemSayeed nobody can convince me LVG is clueless. I made my mind up he knows football long before he came to united
@NadeemSayeed if LVG was winning with 3-5-2 , not a soul would complain. Now everyone feels they can dissect tactics because of results

I don't believe for one second he will stay the duration of his contract . Not even a microsecond
De Gea to sign the extension. Fantastic . more money when he gets sold. More bargaining power for united
Feel free to be offended by personal opinion. Don't bother me with your objections. Quite frankly - shove it

Valencia .Evans. Jones . Rafael. Falcao. RVP ( Due to age + wages)
@SalmanRooney look at Bayern. They had Martinez, Ribery,Robben, Gotze, Thiago out for long spells .Yet they won the BuLi
@SalmanRooney we just need depth more than anything .A squad of players of near equal abilities so one injury doesnt derail us
@SalmanRooney hopefully gundogan or someone else of that ilk. We need that balance
@SalmanRooney he comes back we win 5. Gets injured we struggle. Comes back we win 6. Gets injured we lose 3 on the bounce. Amazing
@SalmanRooney I have always noticed carrick makes us tick. Remember our shit start to the season? He was out
@ABIOKAY lol the falcao virus don dey spread
A resourceful display, issues with balance, no goals and an inspirational instagram post
Falcao came on. I didn't even have the energy to have hope. Like death  and Taxes , we know the outcome .
@SalmanRooney We need him back there . pronto
@mufc4thefans I think the team believe they have UCL wrapped up. I don't see the urgency we had prior to spurs
@EbiIsQuiet we just have to crawl to 4th place somehow
@Chimaimo we are trying to equalize , Dede is crossing to corner flag. 

I just tire
"@Chimaimo: @kennagq  the guy useless. Totally useless"

Lol I wanted to faint yesterday
@mufc4thefans Rooney has been poor lately. Can't deny that. RVP looked ok to me
Can't remember the last good game Rooney had. Been a while
RVP actually played well. Rooney sucked.
Di maria just disappointed me. A goal down with minutes to go  the man can't get the ball into the 18. Tragic
When we had Beckham we had hope. Even in the 89th minute you can bank on 3-4 accurate crosses.
You either know how to cross, or know how to dribble and cut in. Pick one . Valencia fails at both
Our wing play is dead. If we cant wingers who can cross, can we at least get goal scoring inverted wingers? Like Robben/ ribery?
Get rid of deadwood. Too many players don't know what to do with the ball
A few clutch signings signed early and integrated quickly . A proper pre season. A good start to the PL

Lemme prepare for church. Need to pray for myself, friends , family and Micheal carrick
Fact is, With Mourinho in charge. You need to be on your A game to win the title
Success comes in cycles. Could be theirs now. Who knows
Congrats to Chelsea. Most consistent team this season. Definitely deserve to win the EPL. Enjoy the title
@Nigerianscamsss Wouldn't have minded an underdog story. But stats reveal Floyd was the better fighter.

Yeah sure . Condemn loss, support team
Being positive irritates some people. They need to look at themselves. Not everyone wants to wallow in negativity
Self implosion never helped any situation.
Stand by your team. You take bragging rights when they win. You support when they lose. It is the balance of support
"@de_boy_Burberry: @kennagq please say a prayer for him."

Carrick should not train. He should go anywhere near jones. Just put him in a glass cell like magneto. Give him red wine till next match

I don't think you can win a boxing match by being humble and Down to earth. 

I really think you can be cocky and still win
Then I remembered it is twitter.
Manny was winning on twitter at some point. Got me confused.
Selling a rematch may be a bit tricky. I definitely wouldnt care to watch. Twatching is so much better

Shots off target then .
Lmao floyd is the real winner here. Parked the bus. No real injuries ( according to twitter).drives off with $180 mil. Jose would be proud
Reading through my TL folks are disappointed.  Imagine if you flew to Vegas with your savings to watch it. 

Could be worse
I didn't even leave my house. Watched the match on twitter and thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thanks folks. Y'all are better than cable
RIP to the wallets that had to die for this dire showing
Looks like Manny went the recent Manchester united way .All possession no bite
I take it based in feedback from the TL , paying $100 to watch this match woulda been a total ripoff
I wonder what could be preventing her. Could it be a certain boxing match?

Sometimes you have to study people before you tell them the truth about themselves. You need to be able to predict reactions
Not everyone can handle the truth. What you intended as constructive criticism will be seen as ' hating' .
