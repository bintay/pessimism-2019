@mamapsu lolllll! I've had them outside of pregnancy, too.
The Internet is infuriating me today.
@mamapsu here's the first one that comes up 
@mamapsu what about a bucket AC? Have you seen those diy videos?
@mamapsu nooo! So complicated :(
The amount of people on my fb timelines freaking out about the military in Texas is exhausting.
@MyReality nope.
@mamapsu we got a window unit from Walmart for less than $200. If you lived nearby, we have another you could borrow =\
@kfcrains hooray!!!
And don't tell me I can just use milk. It's not the same! (Although that's probably what I'll do.)
We are out of coffee creamer. Send help.
@mamapsu get lots of fans.

I'm awake and apparently so is baby girl. I've never felt her so active.
This is what is calculated. I know it's just an estimate. 
Looking at the Chevy Sonic hatchback.
I'm really hopeful and optimistic about it. Mainly because he does know how badly it's needed.
Likely I'll try to buy a car no later than September. Keith is this -&gt;o&lt;- close to being fully on board.
If the microwave dings again tonight, I'll be extra convinced it's a ghost in the house.
@kaitlinshafer lol, accurate.
@ritadoesntcare hm. Most of the Amazon reviews are good. Hoping to hear more before we fully decide, but def leaning towards it.
@rabbitandbee @endomom14 she made a good point, we eat steamed veggies anyways, so I could also use unseasoned leftovers for baby food.
@kaitlinshafer @Southernmamajkd I'm going to discuss it at my next appointment.
@kaitlinshafer @Southernmamajkd it's not something I thought to ask about until now.
@kaitlinshafer @Southernmamajkd it makes me worry my doc would be the same.
@kaitlinshafer yeah, she is.
@megishem it just makes me very very awake.
@kaitlinshafer 36w3d.
@kaitlinshafer I think that's terrible that they would do that.
@kaitlinshafer they don't want to because baby is breech, and plan a c section at 39w if he doesn't turn.
@megishem no. I'm just getting a cold lol. I had the sore throat before. It was just too much caffeine for so late in the day.
@kaitlinshafer I don't want it at all either. My sister had it twice and those were her hardest births, she says.
@kaitlinshafer I remember, but my friend's doc won't let her go longer than her due date =\
I'm getting sick. Sore throat coming on.
@kaitlinshafer are you with an OB or midwife? I assume they'll let you go over it some?
@kaitlinshafer you know, I haven't asked my doc if they generally let people go past their due date.
I had 2 cups of coffee earlier and it was a huge mistake.
Jalapeño mustard is so good.
@endomom14 that's good. She gave me the bullet system and speed steamer system, so that may help.
@CnLMama @BDubDIVF that's the only reason I'd do cloth. My sister's kids are allergic to some brands of disposable.
@CnLMama @BDubDIVF we talked about it, and Keith seemed open to try it, but we both know me too well. Lol.
@CnLMama @BDubDIVF good point.
@BDubDIVF @CnLMama with water and electricity to wash/dry them, I'm not sure I'd save as much $ as people in other places anyways.
@BDubDIVF @CnLMama I think that'll be me probably lol. It's why cloth diapers are unrealistic for me.
@CnLMama @BDubDIVF she sent me the freezer storage things too, so I'm sure that'll help some.
@BDubDIVF if not, I'll pass it on. I have 2 friends here that will have babies about the same age as my girl.
@BDubDIVF it's pretty much brand new, and free, so I figure I'll at least try it out lol.
If I decide it's too much effort (I plan on going back to work after a few months) I'll pass it on to someone else.
My laziness level tells me I probably won't use the baby bullet much, but I'll def try it.
It's my restaurant boss's daughter. Her baby is like 2.5 now.
The same person who gave me the baby bullet system is giving me a ton more baby stuff this week.
@endomom14 we both drive trucks. I'm planning on trying to get something else though. Maybe a hatchback.
@endomom14 have you thought about getting a shade extender? I think that's what I'll do.
@endomom14 that doesn't sound so bad at all! Hopefully Keith will finally agree to the brand and let me buy it.
@endomom14 how do you like it? Pros and cons.
And then I said "wait no. Not fire. Wake up. Alarm."
And I slept so hard, that when I shook Keith awake to hit snooze on his alarm, instead of saying "alarm" like normal, I said "fire."
After I turned the tv on last night, I passed out pretty quick. After I thought there was a ghost in the house, I mean.
That's what we're looking at. Haven't exactly decided, but it's the one I like best so far. Lots of colors, not too bad price wise.
Anybody have a Baby Trend Expedition jogger system?
@probimposs cotton is a very water intensive crop.
@probimposs this is true. The articles main focus is on the cost of actually growing/shipping/manufacturing cotton cloth
@probimposs insurance is going ok. I'll basically just have to pay my deductible, which is $3000.
@probimposs cloth is not a realistic choice for me because I don't keep up with laundry well as it is.
@probimposs this popped up in my news feed and it does make really good points.
@probimposs they both have big downsides, but I've been thinking about how cloth isn't really greener a lot lately.

Got mostly to sleep, then I SWEAR I heard the microwave ding. Went and checked. Nobody is out there.
Maybe if I turn the tv on I'll be able to drift off.
Used my alertness to finish a book I started earlier this evening.
Stupid brain. Said I was ready to sleep and it kicked into high gear.
Had such a nice day today. But now I'm exhausted and need sleep.
@tntux it's a good idea.
@tntux it very well could be, but it's true that cotton is an expensive crop in more ways than one.
Cloth: not really a greener alternative.

@mamapsu I'm on snapchat.

@mamapsu same. But we have someone renting the room =\
Took the plunge. Bought some maternity clothes.
My girl has mostly gray and turquoise clothes so far. I think we're super worried about being overwhelmed by pink lol.
@MyReality but probably a big part of that is my hormones at work, so idk.
@MyReality I love him other than that comment, so I'm sticking with him. It did make me feel bad though.
@AggieAnne04 oh good lord no!
@AggieAnne04 they never told me how much to gain, but I'm assuming standard 20-25.
@AggieAnne04 I didn't think so either, but now I'm all worried about it.
@AggieAnne04 from 11w to 18w I've gained 9.
@AggieAnne04 no, by my last visit at 11w, I'd already gained back a couple. I've gained 9lb since then. 18w now.
I guess I'll try to be even more careful about what I eat. I'm already walking and on my feet a lot. Maybe I should add a bit more though.
@AggieAnne04 I lost 10-12 in the first tri. I'm just now back at what I weighed when I found out I'm pregnant.
Doc said I need to be more aware of my weight. Um, I am. I didn't think I was doing too bad, getting to pre preg weight at 18w.
@AggieAnne04 mine has always been on the lower end of things anyways, so maybe that has something to do with it too :)
@AggieAnne04 it might be just fine. Everybody is different.
@AggieAnne04 you have more blood flowing during pregnancy, basically.
@AggieAnne04 everything I've read says it's normal for it to be lower. Even my dr says it's fine.
@JJs_journey it's pretty freakin cool!
@TheresaPolyakov funny thing is i just walked all over the hospital, so it may even be a tad higher than normal lol
@CaffeinatedMama my blood pressure is always low. It's normal to be low in pregnancy because you have more blood flowing.
Blood pressure is 92/50.
Just a little over a pound a week since my last appointment.
Gained 9lbs. Not terrible, I guess. Back at pre pregnancy weight.
I don't think I'd have been seen on time anyways. It's a madhouse in here.
I figured it out. But I'm late for my appointment now.
Ok. Had to park in the parking garage and got all turned around on the hospital campus.
@mamapsu thank you.
I'll be weighed today anyways. It won't be exactly accurate because dr scales never are. But should be within 5lbs of true weight.
I'm probably worried for nothing. I lost like 10-12lbs in first tri. So maybe it's fine.
Anyways, here's my 18w1d pic. I forgot to take one yesterday. 
Plus I wasn't exactly thin to begin with.
I'm a little worried I'm too big already, but it really hasn't gotten much bigger over the last couple of weeks.

Ew. Someone is boiling crawfish and it stinks.
@trevyknows like, January itself is 1, feb is 2, etc. if you count it that way, what I'm saying makes sense.
@trevyknows January counts as a full month. Technically I guess October doesn't since I'm due right at the beginning. Still more like 9
Oh. That reminds me. I need to call my insurance company today.
But I'm still going to be paying off medical bills for forever.
Got a bill from hospital for estimated cost of L&amp;D, before any complications, of course. It's actually not too bad.

Running errands sucks. Still have to go to the bank and then get gas.
Ah. Post office said it was a sub driver yesterday. Makes sense.
Not sure why they didn't leave it.
Picking up a package at post office. It could've fit in the mailbox, plus someone was home when the mail lady came by.
@megishem my last period was end of December, I'm counting the full month of January since they start from date of last period.
@audra_spiven but the adding two weeks thing still holds up pretty decent, considering.
@audra_spiven it shouldn't now since they can measure the fetus and tell how far along.
@audra_spiven they count from the date of your last period. It used to be the only reliable method they had to tell how far along you were
Idk. It just makes more sense to call it ten to me.
They add
With the 2 weeks that add because of last menstrual period, I mean.
My date of conception is January 11. My due date is October 4. That's exactly 1 week shy of ten full months.
@audra_spiven the date of conception is already considered 2 weeks along. My date of conception and due date are exactly 1 week shy of 10m
Maybe we call it 9 instead of 10 bc by the time you find out you're pregnant you're already technically a monthish along and have 9 left
I got pregnant in January. My due date is in October. That's 10 months.
@CnLMama being pregnant from January to October is 10 months, anyways.
@CnLMama people call it 9mo because of calendar months, apparently. I think it's easier to forget that and just say 10m.
@CnLMama I googled, it says 39w is ft now.
@megishem I think we should forget calendar months and just call it 10 months.
@Silenthopes80 why *not* lol
@Silenthopes80 I'd be 9 months at 36 weeks. Pregnancy is 40w, why it just call it 10?
Pregnancy is 40w. I'd call it 10 months, not 9. Full term is what, 36, 37 weeks?
Why is it not this way? It makes more sense.
I count the months by every 4w. So at 16w, i would say I'm 4 full months, going into 5th. By 20 I'd say 5 full months.
Ok. Every chart I've seen says 5 months starts at 18w. Which I think is weird.

I already feel self conscious a bit and worried that I'm getting too big too fast. So that was nice.
And I got my first "but you're so big!" comment regarding how many weeks along I am.

@rabbitandbee but encouraging running and screaming by actively playing is not cool.
@rabbitandbee besides maybe taking the kid outside or something for a minute. Or whatever works to calm them.
@rabbitandbee tantrums are an exception because sometimes they just happen and there's not much you can do
@rabbitandbee yeah, as a server, I would have to ask the parents to please have the child sit down.
@megishem the parents were playing with him, making him run and scream. Not ok.
Sometimes it can't be helped, but if you're actively playing with the kid and encouraging running and yelling in a restaurant, that's not ok
Not everyone finds the ear piercing, shrill screams of your kid as delightful as you do.
Yes, I realize he's having fun, but it's unsafe to run through here and disruptive to others for him to be screaming like that.
Yes, I realize your kid is a toddler. No, it is not ok for him to be literally running around and shrieking.
I hate when parents don't encourage appropriate restaurant behavior from their kids.
@OurExpandingZoo @only_everything which is crazy to me. At 11-12 I watched 4 other kids. 1yo, 2yo with CP, 7yo, 8yo. For HOURS at a time.
@only_everything @OurExpandingZoo I started babysitting a one year old when I was 10.
Maybe if they weren't so high, I could afford a better vehicle. Which I really need.

14 hours. It wasn't really all that bad, but it wasn't great either lol
We have electricity! Soooo glad it didn't take another day.
@FJavaid78 it's chicken and veggies in foil packages and baked potatoes.
Food is in the fire. 
I'm listening to "Summer Hits of the 90s Radio" on #Pandora 
I'm listening to "Best I Ever Had" by @VerticalHorizon on #Pandora 
Read a fashion article that said boot cut jeans are out of style. That writer is clearly not from Texas.
We definitely started the fire using nail polish remover because we didn't have enough starter fluid.
@FJavaid78 gotta do something besides just stare at each other lol. Gonna cook over it, too.
Electricity is out and will probably be out a good while. This is our entertainment for the evening.… 
Me and buddy the dog are watching. Lots of Mosquitos out right now.
Keith is working on getting a fire going. No dry kindling lol.

Went and picked up firewood from FIL. That shall be our entertainment and method of cooking for tonight.
Supposed to be another storm coming tonight. Supposedly worse than this morning.
Walmart has power now. I'm one of the first her now that it's back on. Gonna buy some batteries and such.
@LiberalGranola it was bad here, maybe worse by the time it hit @mamatiggsinNOLA   Hope it's not as bad for you!
@only_everything it was so bad here this morning. Lots of trees down on power lines and such. Ugh.
Omg, now the word is our city may not have power back until Wednesday. This is what happens when you live out in the country!
Have questions about insirance and max out of pocket type stuff. Can anyone help me?
All we got was limbs in the yard.
My house. Some downed trees going down the road, though.
I know the tornado sirens went off here, but I didn't see a tornado. Trees were def swirling around in the wind, but no big damage at
Still predicting no power at least until late tonight/early tomorrow at best.
The wind was terrible this morning. Both towns outside of here have power. We must've got the worst of it.
One restaurant in town ran on generator power for lunch. I expect they will for dinner, too.
@endomom14 I wish I had any hand me downs to send you lol. My sister only had 1 boy and he's 6 now.
@endomom14 but they're also excited, so may still get carried away with outfits lol.
@endomom14 most of my friends and family are extremely laid back, so I think they'd understand that.
@audra_spiven that's awesome! Thanks for the advice.
@couch_dad I may put in that request, then. Obv would still accept clothing as a gift, but hoping for more useful things lol
@audra_spiven I did, but it's different to seem like you're being very specific about gifts.
@mamatiggsinNOLA definitely do understand that!
@couch_dad I've noticed especially for girls, people tend to skip the registry items more often and buy clothes.
@couch_dad right, but is it acceptable to also request no (or very few) clothing items?
@Southernmamajkd it's a legit worry for me bc I have literally nothing for a baby, and clothing isn't so essential in my situation
I know I'll still get some clothes as gifts, and that's fine. I just worry that I'll be so overloaded with them...
&gt; would it be rude to include registry info on shower invite, and ask for no clothes? I don't really know the etiquette here.
It seems I'm getting hand me down baby clothes from every direction (which is great!) my question: &gt;
Have lots of phone calls to make today.
@mamatiggsinNOLA lines are down all over. A tree fell on the lines near my house. Crazy weather in the south today.
@mamatiggsinNOLA that's what I'm gonna have to do. Power went out around 5:30am.
@mamatiggsinNOLA do you guys have power?
Going ahead and eating the sliced fruit out of the fridge. No point letting it go bad.
Rumor is the city won't have power until tonight or possibly even tomorrow morning.
Really wish I could have coffee. Can't even go anywhere for any!
We don't have power today. Whole city is out after the big storm this morning. Even Walmart and schools are closed.
@mamatiggsinNOLA looks like you're getting worse winds though :(

@CaffeinatedMama it is! Thank you for saying that and not blaming it on hormones.
Sure, there's a small chance the tech got it wrong, and I'm anxious about that small chance. Stop making it worse.
GTFO my face, please.
Also cannot STAND people insisting baby is a boy. We had an ultrasound. Baby is a girl. "No they were wrong, it's a boy, I'm never wrong."
I had it with food over the course of about an hour.
@PoisonousBain I read all of these and really liked them!
I also don't want to hear shit about me having an 8oz glass of half wine, half sprite. It's not going to hurt anything.

@megishem we have a boy name picked
It would be hard to adjust my thoughts, maybe.
What if they told me my baby is a girl, but turns out to be a boy? It wouldn't be terrible, but idk how I'd feel if they got it wrong.
@endomom14 that's why I can't drink ginger ale. Drank it during chemo.

So many A names. This is the list I gave to Keith.

Y'all got any good girl names that start with A?
@whatwouldjendo I think we're going to order a memory foam one online.
I'll let y'all know what we decide on :)
First name I'm being stubborn on, though. I'd love to keep it, so hopefully that works out for us.
Keith isn't exactly keen on Ann as a middle name, so we may be making a list of new possible middle names.

I'm gonna call tomorrow and try to figure this out.
I got a bill and a refund check in the mail on the same day. I don't get it.
And if it is, why are they still saying I still owe them like twice what my refund is?

@some1elsesbaby my thoughts exactly.
I was extremely worried and anxious at first for several reasons, but that's pretty much gone away, mostly.
I know there are people who aren't happy about having a baby, but you'd think that anybody who knows me would realize that's not my case.
Um, yeah?
People ask me a lot if I'm happy about being pregnant.
@MrsPanad whoa, what is this??
@ashleighlynne lol, yes! Moms figured out how to raise kids long before there were books or classes. I think I'll be ok.
@Silenthopes80 exactly!
@ashleighlynne I mean, if you've NEVER been around kids before, it might be a good idea
@ashleighlynne I just don't feel like it's absolutely necessary, truthfully.
@whatwouldjendo I want Keith and my sister in the room. That's about it, really.
@MyReality right? Great plan, imo.
@whatwouldjendo I don't have any demands lol.
@HippieIncognito I think I will :)
My plan is to go in, so whatever it takes to safely get baby out, then go home when it's time. The end.
I'm also not writing out a lengthy birth plan because I don't think it's necessary.
And with the Internet in all of it's knowledge bearing glory, I don't feel like I need to pay for that same knowledge in a group setting
Truthfully, I still have to meet my $3000 deductible, so I'm not doing anything that isn't absolutely necessary.
@HippieIncognito you can also call or schedule with LCs directly after you go home if you need or want extra help.
@HippieIncognito so unless there's a class for after baby is born, I'll skip that
@HippieIncognito my nurse said the class is like how breastfeeding works and hormones and stuff. I know the science behind it, &gt;
@HippieIncognito they have LCs at the hospital that come in after birth to show you what you need to know. &gt;
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna take any prenatal classes. I mean, probably just cpr for infants, but prob nothing else.
@Midnight_Liley it's still a bit big now, but hopefully in a couple weeks it'll be snug enough to not look silly lol

I haven't had a ton of cravings, but around 6-7 this morning I wanted some red koolaid so bad.
I can do a lot of stuff, and I'm confident in that knowledge, but that's not really a safe or comfortable option.
Like, I know I'm a tough bitch, but do you really expect me to haul boxes and work 15 hour days until I give birth?
I hate when people give me this disappointed look when I tell them I left my job with Little Debbie.
Should've worn a belt today. All of my pants are either too small or too big.
Just 8 more days! I hope baby cooperates and we can find out instead of waiting until mid May for OB anatomy scan.
Wouldn't be surprised if my subconscious is completely wrong though.
So that's 5/5 girl dreams.
Fifth baby dream this morning. Dreamed I delivered a bit early, but that it went quickly and (mostly) smoothly. And it was a girl.
@broedkipje I usually just try to imagine myself falling asleep and that works pretty well, too.

@broedkipje @apluseffort right? Lol
@apluseffort I especially love the website.
All I really want right now is sliced cucumber with bits of deli sliced turkey, dipped in ranch dressing.
@bumlaser "come aboard, shipmates!" 4yo sister starts cracking up yelling "COME ABOARD, SHITFACE!"
@bumlaser speaking of being on board. My 6yo nephew was pretending the toy box was a ship, telling younger sisters to &gt;
@bumlaser ooh, ooh! Go with Captain. That'll sound right.
Working tomorrow. Gotta makes me some money so I don't have to give birth with this guy ;) 
@bumlaser first of all, why have you not been using guvnah all along? You should do that for sure. Second, is coach bad somehow?
@mamapsu yes, this.
Or Ativan. But I can't have either. And I'm out of Ativan anyways.
Hate that anytime I feel less than decent emotionally, I feel like I need a drink.
Emotional today.
I just want all of the food <TIRED FACE> except meat. No meat. <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>🏼<POULTRY LEG>
@mamapsu I want to sleep, eat, and punch people.
@mamapsu it sucks. I just want to sleep and nothing else.
I can't wake up today. I feel so tired and sluggish and it's kind of awful.
@audra_spiven yeah, it was a bit of a worry, but we're going to see if we can stick together and be happy. Hopefully it all works out.
@audra_spiven yeah, we are :)
Got home and it's off again. I was really hoping for coffee =\
When I got up at 8:25 the electricity was off. Came back on as I was heading to the window place.
In other news, I slept terribly because of horrifically loud thunder and then disturbing dreams
Got Keith's window fixed. Now we can roll both sides down when we're on the road.
Trying to get Keith's window fixed. It's been an ordeal.

@cocktailsnkids on my stomach anyways.
@cocktailsnkids no lol. I'm only 15w, so idk if it would make any difference right now. I really can't feel anything unless I'm lying
@cocktailsnkids felt like something bumping me very very lightly. But from inside lol
@cocktailsnkids then I felt it again today. Was laying kind of on my stomach both times.
@cocktailsnkids I think I was feeling it last night and it felt weird so I changed positions. Then I was like "wait..."
@some1elsesbaby i don't feel it all the time, but I was laying on my stomach, kind of
@13thgravegypt I know, just funny :)
@13thgravegypt that's like the saddest thing anyone has ever said to me lol. But yeah, I don't ever use snapchat anymore.
@13thgravegypt I don't see them.......?
It's not a ton, and pretty light. But I don't think it's gas bubbles or anything.
I think I might be feeling baby movements...

Ok. He's ptfo in bed now. So glad I didn't let him have more.
Yeah, he got sick :(
Gotta say, that's one thing I don't miss.
Poor Keith had maybe too good of a time tonight lol. He can't lay down without feeling bad.
@LiberalGranola there are other brands. The firefly looks nice too.
@LiberalGranola check this out 
@rabbitandbee it does lol.
And I just got hungry at an inopportune time.
@tntux I'm sure I'll find something to do :)
This mfkr I'm sitting by is talking to us and has been showering me with spit and I'm getting irritated.
@megishem right? And I've been taking care of babies since I was 10. I'm not unfamiliar with the concept.

I guess I'll get out of pajamas and into some clothes that are appropriate for leaving the house.
I love this response lol 
Um, no? You get to have a baby, right?
Question on the WTE Oct 2015 board: is October a bad month for a baby to be born?
@jenrutner there have been PPPLLLLEEENNTTTYYYY of times I've skipped shaving because fuck it
@jenrutner it's not really for them, more for me lol. I enjoy smooth legs :)
Sent Keith this recipe for onion bombs, that you cook in the coals of a bonfire. His response: 
One more ep of 3rd rock and then I'll do it. Probably. Maybe.
Supposed to go to our friends house for food and darts in a couple hours. I should really shave my legs so I can wear capris.
@tntux lol!!!!!
This is what I get from the darkest setting on my toaster. 
@AwesomelyIced I was totally gonna get one just like that!
You really get to a point where you get fed up with people being offended over life in general. #vaguetweet #dontask
I need to eat something. I've been awake a while, but have been lazing around in bed.
Also I feel like I look way too big for being 15w tomorrow. And another asshole touched my stomach yesterday <POUTING FACE>
Keith suggested I scrub out the bathtub and take a relaxing bath today, but idk if I'm up for the scrubbing honestly lol.

@godmama_ash I think it could. I mean, I don't see why not. Especially if it's with other dinosaur themed stuff.
@apluseffort DEAL!
I want a personal assistant who does nothing but fill out forms and paperwork for me.
Basically it's been 5 years nonstop of doctors.
I don't find it particularly exciting to register for stuff, mostly because I've filled out enough medical type forms to last a lifetime.
So basically I need to register everywhere ASAP.
AND when I go back to my OB next, I have to register with the anesthesiologist in case I decide on birthday to have an epidural.
Idk how much those will cost. If it's $$$, I'll be skipping those.
And I need to register with the hospital in the next two weeks and register for all my baby classes, too.
@rabbitandbee I haven't met my deductible yet, so I have to pay that much in. If I meet it or get closer to it, they'll refund me.
That's just for my OB's office to deliver.
It's about $490/month starting this month through August. That'll meet my deductible for the year, at least.
I'm $72 short for my half of april's "baby payment" lol.
So over the last 2 days I worked 14 hours and made about 12.36 an hour. Not too bad.
May also work for her tomorrow from 2-10. Just don't know yet.
I'm so tired, and I know I'll be even more tired later tonight.
Worked 9-2. Will work again from 5-10. Filling in for friend/coworker whose mom passed away this morning.

Keith and I both took a nap today. Now we'll be up all night.
Gas* bubble. Not has. Getting real fuckin tired of autocorrect.
It's not heartburn or reflux.
Things I eat now give me that painful, feels like imminent death has bubble in my chest.
@CaffeinatedMama nope, they're all different brands. I have a couple.
@CaffeinatedMama it's boutique stuff, that's why it's so expensive. Some of it is great quality, some of it not. Just depends.
Keith's idiot dog is dumb but lovable. 
(I don't go in until 11, so it's not THAT long, I just get hungry before 2 lol.)
I'm gonna have to start having a bigger breakfast and/or bringing snacks to work. Waiting until 2 for lunch is killer.
@audra_spiven exactly.
They did the same thing when I had cancer lol.
Funny how many have deleted me on fb but are now adding me back since I'm pregnant.
@apluseffort oh, thanks. I just meant to show that my pants weren't giving me a muffin top now, though :)

I'm calmed down a bit now, but do not fuck with a pregnant hormonal lady who needs this thing to be able to wear pants in public.
Also made a sign for the door directing delivery folks where to leave packages from now on.
And I will be calling the UPS service center tomorrow to complain about lack of common sense service.
I know it says in care instructions not to use bleach, but it's white and the dog got dirt ALL OVER it.
Cold wash cycle with detergent and bleach got the bellaband cleaned up.
@PrepperNaturale although if you don't want them anymore, i'd be glad to take one off your hands.
@PrepperNaturale it's a 2. Luckily bleach got the dirt out of it pretty easily. Still so unhappy with ups. Will be calling tomorrow.
My bad, it was UPS. Still, what a fucking idiot. Why not leave it on top of the car or somewhere the dog won't get it? Jesus.
Calling the post office to complain about the mail carrier's lack of common sense and leaving her a note in the mailbox.

@KAmama2013 you think maybe using liners is keeping things too moist down there?
@ritadoesntcare I was gonna say hot dogs lol. But I really have no idea what constitutes normal.
@KAmama2013 stay away from scented feminine products and anything like that. I know it can help mask odor, but it's counterproductive.
@KAmama2013 hmm. Are you douching? That can def cause it. Or if you're getting soap in there during washing, even.

Guess I'm working tonight. Bar waitress. I was the last resort lol.
Can't stand the smell of southern pecan coffee. It makes me feel so icky.
Keith recently described my hair as "horrifically curly." Finding it hard to disagree. 
@mamapsu jibe would work.
Things might be ok now. I got some chicken strips and tortillas. I can make it work.
I'm an unhappy camper.
Wtf, Dairy Queen no longer has chicken wraps. And McDonald's fucked theirs up with shitty chicken long ago.
It's not as warm out as I thought. Should've worn a shirt with some form of actual sleeves.
Seriously need my new job to start, though.
Did a scary thing and checked my bank acct. Not broke yet. Relieved.

Is it just me or does my nose look huge? =\
@mamapsu I do this. I can't help it! My hips hurt from old running injuries, so I have to.

@endomom14 I would imagine so. I hope that whatever happens, you feel better and everything gets to the right level.
@mamapsu but I guess it's acceptable bc baby.

@endomom14 it was awesome. $18, but SO worth it
@endomom14 funny how that happens. I can't eat ANY tacos, which I usually love. It's so sad.
@endomom14 true. The thought of Taco Bell just makes me feel gross. I just ate half a large pizza <FLUSHED FACE>
YUM 
@endomom14 I can't stand Taco Bell lately. I went with Pizza Hut :)
@JJs_journey might just go with a belly band for a while. The words "maternity pants" scare me lol.
It has come to this. 
Also. My pants are starting to not fit. The two things are (mostly) unrelated.
I love ordering food online.
@CnLMama the stuff seems more expensive than what I'd normally pay for clothes, though.
@CnLMama you tell it what you like. They send you a box of clothes. You buy what you like, send the rest back.
Had a short list of things to do today. I'll get to that too.
As soon as my nails are dry, it's gonna be good time.
You want to take time off to play today but you might have too... More for Leo 
@LiberalGranola aww
@LiberalGranola poor guy :(
@LiberalGranola I hope it heals up soon though.
@LiberalGranola last year I took care of a dog that got TORN UP by other dogs. I understand the grossness.
@LiberalGranola :( can you do anything for it?
@megishem it's terrible. It's hard to stand up without passing out.
@megishem they said its fine, but it has me feeling dizzy and short of breath a lot.
@megishem I don't like it.
When I went yesterday to the doc, it was like 95/55.
This dang low blood pressure thing is killing me.
Finally getting around to watching Parks &amp; Rec season 7.

@probimposs yeah, I'm going through another insomnia phase. Had it around 7-8 weeks, too.
@probimposs I think it's because they have so much extra in them that makes me sick.
@fromwinetovino shitbag ex who was possible father. But it's Keith's, so that's good
@fromwinetovino @Southernmamajkd @IVFmiraclebaby 
@Southernmamajkd @fromwinetovino @IVFmiraclebaby just called me a fucking cunt whore and tried to make some kind of dig at me about cancer
@probimposs that's what I switched from. Those make me nauseated.
@fromwinetovino @IVFmiraclebaby no, but he responded lol
@IVFmiraclebaby shitbag ex who was a potential father. It was between him and Keith. Thankfully it's Keith's.
@mamapsu I wish there were words that could help you. Or. Maybe there are some. I just don't know them.
@hardlygracie oh man, I'm in for something that's just once daily. I can't commit to 3x a day lolllll
@hardlygracie I haven't.
Supposed to be napping. Failing.
@mamapsu I haven't felt anything yet.
@mamapsu I hear you can feel them sooner if you've been pregnant before, since you know what it feels like already.
Hoooolllleeeee shit. My favorite  RX prenatals are $100, even with insurance.
Chats with grandma. 
@KAmama2013 yeah :)
Famous last words 
@MellowMWMama dang, go you!

@mamapsu maybe just ute stretching?
Oh, also I don't have an iron. So that may be a bit of an issue.
@LeLeIsMe easter shirt.
Plus idk what program to use.
Need to make an iron on transfer thing, but feeling too lazy to do it. Plus idk if I can get the transfer paper here.
Finally, it's an acceptable bed time.
Wtf is up with fb guys? This is not a free for all. I don't want to date yall.
@MyReality anytime lol
@Crys24 prenate mini worked well for me. Might go back to those.
@megishem congrats :) I keep thinking mine's a girl, but still got a few weeks to find out.
Wait. I know two having girls. Hmm. I won't know for another few weeks, myself.
Except for a friend who is having twin girls.
Another of my friends is having a baby boy. Everybody's having boys.
@ashleighlynne conceived in 88 here :)
@happytubbs oh man lol
@megishem my younger sis was born May of 92.
@happytubbs yes! That scene was on a few minutes ago.
Went a whole week with no nausea or puking, until yesterday when I felt all queasy. Same thing today.
Once I took the test and got a positive, it pretty much went away. Then I had a week or two of exhaustion. Then morning sickness started.
That feeling was the first thing that clued me in to being pregnant. I'm talking, like pre 14dpo.
@megishem July.
Kinda like heartburn, but not quite? Idk, it's the carbonation that does it, I think.
Think I'm getting back to not being able to drink soda again bc it makes me feel weird.
@megishem not by too much lol. What month?
(I was born in 89.)
Watching Teen Witch on Netflix. I love the 80s. And obviously everything to come out of '89 is THE ABSOLUTE BEST.
Foods I want: shrimp cocktail or shrimp Alfredo. Miracle whip. (Not together.)
I should've saved the last bit of lasagna from last night, because now I want some.
(Just kidding, kind of. I'll have to eat again before I go to sleep.)
It's just been an emotional few days. Is it too early to go to bed?
@MrsPanad it's horrible. HORRIBLE.
@MrsPanad me too. It's going to cost me $487/month for the next five months just for my OB to deliver the kid.
Hopefully it's not an expensive prescription. Will call my OB about it tomorrow.
I really liked the Prenate Mini vitamins. Felt good in every way on them.
The only upside is that they kinda smell like marshmallows.
Don't like the sample vitamins I'm trying out. They do nothing for me. And I've felt nauseated while on them.
Didn't even get to eat as much as I wanted. Got full too soon.
Can't binge drink, so I'll just binge eat. Not really a great trade off, but I need to do something with these feelings.
I miss booze. And prozac. I haven't been on prozac in months, but I miss it today.
Totally forgot I rented a redbox movie last night.

@LeLeIsMe lived, not loved. Stupid autocorrect.
@LeLeIsMe I like 30 rock, haven't seen much of the office, haven't tried kimmy Schmidt yet.
@LeLeIsMe not a FNL fan. Tried it. I'm already in tx. Loved it lol.

@LeLeIsMe @OurExpandingZoo ...... Dowutnow?
@OurExpandingZoo oh right. I forgot you're sick. And it might be weird to ask for help lol
@OurExpandingZoo wouldn't it smell different?
The only gunmetal I need <WINKING FACE><NAIL POLISH> 
Nails and cuticles groomed, clear base coat applied and drying.
Doing my nails and watching Practical Magic. Starting to feel better.
I just want to watch Ponyo and I can't because it's not on any streaming services :(
It would be SO GREAT if I could have a beer right now. #stress #anxiety #badatcoping
@CnLMama dm
@tntux I've pretty much had fruit, bread, and dairy.
Doing a terrible job with food groups today.
Binge eating.
Today has really gone to shit.
@TheresaPolyakov easter is April 5.
EW. There was a caterpillar on me :( I despise bugs.
@whatwouldjendo shocked is an understatement lol.
@CnLMama rumors and gossip are fine. I just don't want to be hounded when I'm out and about.
@OurExpandingZoo pretty sure there are rumors already.
@OurExpandingZoo I actually am on amoxicillin for a UTI, but I doubt it will make a difference.
I got invited to hang out later today. I'm not sure if I'll have the courage.
@FJavaid78 it's not. I miss my friends.
And they will ask. This is a small Texas town. They WILL ask.
And I want to, but I don't want a bunch of nosy questions that I'm not really sure I'm ready to answer.
I've hardly seen/socialized with anybody outside of work in WEEKS.
And I've never been one to turn down a drink. Like, ever.
It's difficult because I can't really hang out with friends without them being suspicious. There's always alcohol around
@whatwouldjendo thanks!!
@TheresaPolyakov gonna do some deep breathing and dog petting. It helps.
That's more caffeine than I'm used to at once.
Showering did not help the anxiety. A big contributing factor is that I had a cup and a half of coffee, instead of just a cup.
@audra_spiven I do. I haven't read all of it, and don't plan to. It was my dad's. I keep it out of sentiment, since I am not religious.
@MeaganHHoule not that I've said anything bad about Canada. Just that I'm sorry you see that stuff online.
@MeaganHHoule sorry =\ I do hate that idiot though. So ashamed he reps texas.
@audra_spiven all of those things, I guess.
I keep thinking I'm ready and how freeing it would be, but then I feel panicky about it.
I'm not really ready. Just the thought makes me extremely EXTREMELY anxious.
It's getting to the point where im about to have to tell pretty much everybody what's up.
@ritadoesntcare hahaha! #oops
@ritadoesntcare that's what the lazy person in me would do. Unless I was super excited, then I'd go even if I lost my leg en route, probably

@mamapsu we aren't. I've been offline.

@probimposs target and Amazon for now. Just basic stuff. Gender neutral.
@AwesomelyIced I need that. I have five cats, 2 dogs, and a turtle.

@MyDaysWithJay but we do have a local fb group and I may get a few things there.
@MyDaysWithJay probably not gonna go with craigslist. Crazy stories from there lately.
@tntux pretty much the same thing :)
Watching 3rd rock from the sun on Netflix. I've always loved this show.
I'm having ramen as a meal again today. My throat hurts too much for anything delicious. Like pizza. Which is what I wanted for dinner.
@Southernmamajkd @MyReality that's exactly what I mean. I'd do it out of necessity for sure.
@mamapsu we can be thankful and miss stuff we have to give up, too. I for one won't let anyone make me feel guilty for that. It's normal.
@mamapsu shit, I miss booze. Idk if you recall my drinking habits before, but DAMN I want a beer so bad. Or crown Apple. Fireball.
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd if it turns out this way for this one, I'll go with cloth at that point.
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd my sister's kids were VERY sensitive to store bought disposables. VERY.
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd we still wash them with fresh water and wash/dry in machines that use electricity, for the most part
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd but they still have to be manufactured and shipped
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd some argue it's better for the environment.
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd I feel like many do it because it's trendy, which is fine.
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd yes, I've seen prices on some of them.
@MyReality @Southernmamajkd I may try it for a while, but in the grand scheme of things, I don't feel like it's as important to me
@broedkipje that would be great :)
@mamatiggsinNOLA ok, thanks :)
@mamatiggsinNOLA not due until October. Should know if boy/girl in the next few weeks. Gonna try to see on April 22. If not, then 4w later.
*for me, not firms.
I think with my income, big ticket items will be more difficult for me to buy. It's better firms to have an idea of what I might spend now
I started doing basics and big stuff now. I think it would be more overwhelming to try to do it all at once.
Thanks for the input!
@samgaray and saving up for it probably won't work for me.
@samgaray with my income, I don't think I have the luxury to wait on big stuff. I'll have to budget and space it out.
@radmamajas that's what I'm thinking.
@fromwinetovino thanks :)
@MyReality that way I can focus on more specific things later. Clothes and whatnot.
@MyReality obviously I can't do much more than basic type stuff at this point, but I figure I might as well get those things done
@apluseffort I haven't watched all of them, but I know Netflix has some.
@couch_dad I'm pretty happy about it, though :) 
@apluseffort I like them too lol. Most recent one I've watched was secret of the wings :)
@apluseffort :) I've bought myself a couple onesies, but nothing else. It's still so early.
@MyReality I'm doing them online, I think.
@samgaray I'm putting big ticket type items on Amazon, so I could do those myself with my prime account.
@samgaray I'm doing one of basics right now. Mostly just getting ideas.
@couch_dad pretty much
@couch_dad thanks!
@couch_dad yeah.
When did you create baby registry?
@apluseffort I didn't used to, but ever since chemo I've been more sensitive to stuff. Idk why.
@MyReality you're really underestimating my laziness.
I like the idea of cloth diapering, but I feel like I'm very likely too lazy to go that route.
@ritadoesntcare the rainbow light brand does that to me. This one hasn't so far, though.
Been trying out the samples of prenatals my dr office gave me. On day 2 of 3 day trial of prenate mini. It doesn't make me puke, so yay.
Working on fluid intake today. And calcium. Idk. Too much to remember that I'm supposed/not supposed to have.
@PrepperNaturale wow! Do it!!!
@PrepperNaturale sounds like a pretty good deal.
No. I don't want that. I want the trial. Then if I like it, it's a guarantee that I'll sign up. Don't force it on me.
I hate when you go to sign up for a free one time trial and the fine print says you'll be auto enrolled in a monthly subscription.
@CnLMama @NikiCatsMum I haven't been mean, but I can feel when I get like I could be.
@NikiCatsMum I'm resting for now, but have some stuff that I have to get done later.
Sore throat is definitely not getting any better. Now sneezing and have a gunky nose.

Watched Annabelle. Now I need someone to go out to my truck with me because it's dark and scary outside.
@OurExpandingZoo I didn't forget the sore throat. Just the Popsicle.
@OurExpandingZoo OH! I just remembered I have a Popsicle and also a sore throat.
@probimposs thank you! Did you see them all? Even the 3D is pretty cool at this stage :)
@Southernmamajkd sounds awesome!
@mamapsu right. I knew those things. Thanks for the links!
@mamapsu I guess my main question is do I need to switch my regular yoga app for a pregnancy app? I use Yoga Stretch
@rabbitandbee :)
@mamapsu good point. Just don't want to gain more than I should!
@mamapsu I did some light yoga before, mostly for stretching my muscles after cardio and weights.
@mamapsu thanks!
@rabbitandbee I did.
Will also be going to the park to walk. Or maybe I'll buy a bike.
Now that I'm not working/walking all day, I need to get in some type of exercise.
Any big difference between standard yoga positions and pregnancy yoga positions?
I found peanut butter!!
@Le_Barren thank you! :)
I have lots of fluids to catch up on today =\
@apluseffort @AwesomelyIced @OurExpandingZoo anytime :)

@pervicacity it's more suspenseful and dramatic than anything, unless you're super scared of zombies/gore.

Trying to watch The Walking Dead from the xfinity app. Hopefully it works or I may stab someone.
@AGarland37 thank you!
@Silenthopes80 thanks :)
@ndpsu thank you!
Consensus is to stick with original date.
So.....what do I go by? 11w2d or 11w6d?
@HippieIncognito thanks :)
@mamapsu :) got about 20 photos on a disc. So cool to see!
Thanks for being patient and understanding.
I promise not to post any more for a few weeks. I may post again between 16-20w when I know if it's a boy or girl.
Here is my baby. 
Here it comes. Don't yell at me for this.
I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings.
I understand it can be tough to see.
If you do not wish to see an ultrasound, please skip over or mute me for a little bit.
It will happen in the next few tweets.
Ok Twitter. Here is the warning: I am getting ready to post an ultrasound photo.
@apluseffort @OurExpandingZoo @broedkipje I want to share, but not alienate too many people. Fine line to walk.
@Crys24 that's my plan.
@apluseffort @OurExpandingZoo @broedkipje I'm def going to post several warning tweets.
I do like this song.  @FifthHarmony #pandora 
@AGarland37 I guess I'm just prone to them. Last time I had urinalysis I had one with no symptoms, not pregnant.
@KeAnne I guess we'll see that start to change in the next few years. Fun to see fluidity of language and such in action!
@KeAnne I've always thought of Blake as a masculine name, too.
@KeAnne I think it's kind of interesting, really.
@hoping2bamom thank you!
@KeAnne I saw that. Blake lively and Ryan Reynolds's kid, right?
@broedkipje thank you, I appreciate that!
Just realized my friend Ted's last name is West. Might need to start calling him Teddy West Side. #HIMYM
@broedkipje I've tried to be, though I'm sure I don't come off that way all the time.
@Minxy_Chick I generally try to be.
@Allisonjd my Twitter app shows image previews regardless. I'll just warn in advance, I think.
@OurExpandingZoo @broedkipje although I *am* trying to be as considerate as possible
@OurExpandingZoo @broedkipje "sad for me and fuck you" is rude, and I think those people can go away.
@OurExpandingZoo @broedkipje like I said on my private acct "happy for you sad for me" is fine...
@Minxy_Chick I may just warn in advance.
@OurExpandingZoo @broedkipje I'm not posting to fb. Not telling fb until next week. It would just be here on Twitter.
@only_everything thanks!
@broedkipje which I think sucks because we shouldn't have to feel bad/wrong for being happy. Idk.
@broedkipje I want to, but I know here it's walking a thin line between celebrating and being deemed offensive.
I feel like every time I have a urinalysis, I have one. I don't get it.
OB's office called to tell me I need abx for a UTI. No symptoms though.
@broedkipje here on Twitter. I haven't come out to fb yet. Won't until next week.
I know I've talked about pregnancy, and know it makes some people sad. So what's the best way to do u/s pic, in your opinion?
@audra_spiven hope your pup is better soon. Give him pedialyte to help with hydration.
Advise me, twitterers. What's the way to go: post ultrasound pic and warn in advance, or DM/text/email to those who want to see?
@Crys24 thank you :)
@audra_spiven my dogs ALWAYS manage to puke on the couch. Every single time.
@AwesomelyIced very much so.
@AwesomelyIced it really is! Tap dancing and jazz hands lol.
@dmb07 likely.
@dmb07 hugs.
It's just really hard to believe.
It's still totally weird to me that I'm pregnant. Like....what? How did this even happen? (Except I know how lol)
Wondering if my October baby will end up being a September baby.
@MrsPanad thank you!
No printout pic, but I have a disc of all of the pictures to take home.
Baby measures 4 days ahead (11w6d instead of 11w2d) and is already kicking and punching LIKE CRAZY.
That was fast.
I think I may be a bit hormonal today.
Not sure why that peeves me so much. I've always hated it.
And they all pronounce Casa Ole, like you'd pronounce "cat." Not the right A sound, people.
No wonder it took forever, they brought their whole fuckin family.
I work hard. I play hard. I'm not like the 600 women that just came out of the ultrasound room.
@samgaray nope. About to go back, hopefully.
Like a place where bored housewives/SAHMs with money to burn would go. I am not really that person.
It feels out of my social class level.
Sigh. This place does not feel like my kind of place.
No medical stuff really takes place. It's just to look. There shouldn't be any reason to go over your time slot.
Maybe I should be less irritated, but this is a for fun ultrasound place. You pay for a basic package with a set session time.
I'm irritated by this delay and lack of service. I may not come back here to find out if it's boy or girl. Idk yet.
Came out, went the the bathroom, just went back in. Nobody is in the front to check for arriving customers/patients.
At the ultrasound place. Appt is for 11:15. The lady before me is taking forever.
@tntux or if it won't stay down =\
@tntux I might. Depends on how my stomach feels lol.
@tntux I'm on my way to the city, so lots of lunch options!
I would not be surprised in the least by any amount that I may get.
Being as so many still guess my age between 17-19ish, I wonder how many teen pregnancy comments I'll get in the coming months.
It's foggy and humid today. The air is like a light soup.
Sometimes you get in a mood and it feels necessary to listen to Mötley Crüe.

If you are @place then you are just saying yo…
@audra_spiven it's "I'm going to a party at @audra_spiven's house." Not "I'm going to a party @audra_spiven's house."
@audra_spiven YES.
@cj__junebug that's the best you can do. Hug.
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced we shoveled sooo much lol. The driveway, a good portion of the sidewalks, some of the street lol.
@cj__junebug unless there's any way to apologize or do something nice, which may not make it right, but may ease your conscience.
@cj__junebug I'm sorry. Been there. I wish that I could say more than just time will heal, but I can't.
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced our relatives were happy we enjoyed doing their chores.
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced we went to Michigan in March when I was a teen. LOVED playing and shoveling lol.
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced never lived with snow, never want to lol. I don't mind going to visit snow, though.
@PoisonousBain just to see the baby, specifically :)
@AwesomelyIced @KAmama2013 I believe it stuck in Dallas and north of there, though.
@AwesomelyIced @KAmama2013 oh wow. I'm forever thankful that we got very little snow this year. Didn't stick in this part of tx
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced everyone here is celebrating the cold weather going away. We hate cold here ;)
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced sorry, I forget about temp differences. It's supposed to get up to 80° here today.
@tntux I found frozen pancakes. That'll do!
Ok. No more time to waste. Need to eat so I can go to my appointment.
@tntux that's part of the plan, but I need food also :)
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced scroll down for kid/baby stuff! 
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced they have different stuff every year. I googled mud pie Easter 2015
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced yep, you can get it online. Cute stuff.
@KAmama2013 @AwesomelyIced have you tried the mud pie brand?
What shall I have for breakfast today?
And in relation to that, I'm ready to hear about my duties for next job, and approximate start date.
In other news, it's amazing to not be at work right now. Hallelujah.
Today is ultrasound day!
Considering getting out of bed to buy a pair of yoga pants and comfy shirt to wear around all day.

Forgot to mention that I dreamed I had a baby girl.
Having hot tea to help this awful sore throat I've had for about 3 days now.
I also have a meeting today with the guy in going to work for next.
@DaBlackapino yup. Switching jobs.
Suppose I'll just put this into the night deposit at the bank and then go try to catch a bit more sleep before my ultrasound today.
Made $1000 for my last week. Not too shabby.
Got up and got my last paycheck and returned my equipment.
Reduced to tears over not being able to play this show on ANY of my devices. @AMC_TV website blows.
I can't get this fucking piece of shit AMC TV website to work. I just want to watch this show.

@ritadoesntcare right? And at this point, that's the amount I'll pay no matter what. I'll get a refund of whatever they don't use.
@bumlaser *dusts hands, walks away with a spring in step and a jubilant whistle*
@mamapsu not sure if you check DMs often, but I sent you one.
@mamapsu I've had so so so much anxiety over this pregnancy.
@mamapsu haha, it's been the same for me the whole time, honestly. I'm working on being in a better frame of mind about it.
@mamapsu very close indeed! According to my last dating scan, I'm 11w today.
@mamapsu (I hope congrats is the appropriate sentiment.)
@mamapsu also, congrats! How many weeks?
@mamapsu is it weird that I suspected this?
@ritadoesntcare as I meet more of my deductible this year, it will be less.
Dr fees for giving birth (as of now) = $2436.48 over the next 5 months. Can't imagine hospital fees <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
I got gift certificates! I'm totally gonna use these. 
I think the problem is that I ate too much too fast, then got in the car.
I thought I avoided it today :(
Ate at chili's after my appointment. Made it maybe 30 min down the road, then had to throw up.
@broedkipje thanks :)
@endomom14 I don't blame you! I'd go if it's as affordable as the one here. $75 is a great price, in my opinion.
@broedkipje we're doing good so far. My due date changed by 2 days, but that's fine with me.
Got a TON of samples at the OB's office. Vitamins, breast feeding supplies, and a newborn diaper. So little! 
@megishem nuchal translucency scan. To check for chromosomal abnormalities/possibility of Down syndrome.
Anatomy scan isn't until 20 weeks, but I can go to the sneak a peek place and get one a little sooner to know gender. That's only $75.
Bummer. But I have a just because ultrasound scheduled for Friday. Just so I can see the baby.
They said I could do the NT scan if I wanted. Can't schedule bc all the places in Houston are booked until after the window is closed.
Gonna get this OB appointment done, then go to the mall, then probably to chili's. Yum!
@IVFmiraclebaby I did just finish chemo in August, though.
@IVFmiraclebaby I'm not sure. I know one OB in the practice wouldn't take me.
@TheresaPolyakov not that I know of. Supposed to be just a consultation.
Having Dunkin Donuts while I wait for my OB appointment. Luckily I'm just right across the street from their office.
And a huge bottle of water.
@MotherOneDay sounds amazing!
I'm starving. STARVING. And so thirsty. After blood draw I'm going to grab a coffee and a pastry for sure
I think I'll ask about the NT scan, and if they won't do it, I'm almost certain my oncologist will order it for me.
@MyLazyOvaries @the2weekwait I was kind of thinking this too.
@BDubDIVF no meds for cancer.
@TheWombWarrior yay!
I have blood work today and can't eat/drink until it's done. It's at 11 or 11:30, I can't remember which.
@TheresaPolyakov I've had a dating scan done already lol. I want them to do the NT scan though. I think I'll ask why they don't.
I can go to the 3rd party "just for fun" u/s place and have one for $50, but no medical advice takes place there.
That's a long time to wait.
They said I won't have an ultrasound until my next appointment after the 31. I'm assuming at 16 or 20w.
They won't even use the Doppler on me until the 31 of this month. I'll be around 13w then.
I'm 11w today. My OB's office doesn't do the 11-12w NT scan... Should I mention this? It seems important.
OB appointment today. Pretty much just a consultation, nothing fancy going on.

@CnLMama @saraams10 the route is too physical. A friend is starting up a biz. I'd be doing office type work.
They don't have non alcoholic beer here. I'm sad now :(
@saraams10 yeah. Tired, some morning sickness.
@saraams10 the route? Thursday is my last day with that job.
@saraams10 also, I think you missed my news the other day... 11w pregnant tomorrow :)
@saraams10 it wasn't. My helper is riding along with me this week. I finished hours earlier than normal.
@mamapsu Thursday is my last day with this job, though. Too physical.
@mamapsu thanks. It's usually only on days that I have to wake up super early, for some reason. (Aka work days)

@HippieIncognito I'd want more than one lol. So odouls it shall be.
@HippieIncognito lol! I think it would be ok to have a regular one now and then, but I feel it might be too tempting for me.
@HippieIncognito I read it takes several to even equal one regular beer, and I want to hang out for st patty's day so bad.

Remember, please. Try to keep it quiet on fb and in real life for just a tad longer.
@SarahJeanQ @MyReality today just about killed me though.
@SarahJeanQ @MyReality normally after getting sick 1, maybe 2 times, I'm fine and I go have a second breakfast.
@SarahJeanQ @MyReality I go with yogurt because it's not totally awful coming back up.
@SarahJeanQ @MyReality I usually eat 2 cups of yogurt first thing when I wake up. Then 1-2 hours later is when it usually hits me
@SarahJeanQ @MyReality might try mints. Green apple def did not help the other day. Also, was chunky coming back up =\

Figured she had alcohol poisoning pretty bad. Better to be in some trouble with the law than dead.
Tried waking her, but couldn't. She was def breathing, so at least I know she was alive.
She hit a stop sign. Tried to get out, but pretty much just slung mud everywhere, with the ground so wet.
