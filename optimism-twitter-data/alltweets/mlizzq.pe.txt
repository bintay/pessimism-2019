17 Orcas at #SeaWorld Who Can't Celebrate #MothersDay: 

Tell them orcas DESERVE a happy #MothersDay too! 
I hate humans who believe in harming animals and wildlife, I don't hate anything else more than that and I wish they did not exist!

@_Prince_Louis I wont waste my time with peta!
@_Prince_Louis sure I'll go give you some then. Although I did mention te movie Blackfish, start there!
@_Prince_Louis Animals, everywhere!
@_Prince_Louis i've given you loads.no matter what you read an what facts you have or show. Sea world will never acknowledge it!
@_Prince_Louis yea I'm a bad person bc I treasure wilf life and hate when any harm is done to them! Horrible person I am!
@_Prince_Louis I don't say Seaworld are  all bad, never did. Just stating the obvious fact that Orcas in their care live a life in hell!
@_Prince_Louis you're delusional! I hope you'll see what is actually happening one day!
@_Prince_Louis go see what is said about orcas in the wild and you'll realised how out on deep fucking water you are.
@_Prince_Louis Go do some actual research read what trainers that have worked at seaworld has to say. Not only what seaworld has to say
@_Prince_Louis you have no idea whatsoever whats going on and I pity the fuck out of people like you.
@_Prince_Louis they live up to their 80's and even older!
@_Prince_Louis just to keep the cash comming in!
@_Prince_Louis my notes, my own words bc of doing research, do yours, go watch blackfish and you'll see what a bunch of lies they tell you
@_Prince_Louis 
@_Prince_Louis Go study an orca in the wild and then tell me seaworld treats them well
@_Prince_Louis i dont give a shit about peta. The fact is that they are being mistreated and live poor lives!
@_Prince_Louis go educate yourself!
Sorry but I can't handle saying 4/4 I can't do it.... <PENSIVE FACE>

@niallsontop children!
@shaihes <GROWING HEART>
@xomaaarenxo @WildBludger I know what you mean!
@IloveNiall173 you didn't :)
@PatOu_1995 thank you :) and I respect that!
@fckmemarcel if you don't agree with me you can say so without trying to shade me! Or say nothing!
@IloveNiall173 we couldn't force zayn to stay and it would have been unfair of us to even try!
I'm done with this now, I've said my part and thats it for me! Not taking sides!
@IloveNiall173 doesn't make them look any less immature to me tbh. But your allowed to have your opinion, no hate! :)
@WildBludger Since them two boys act like the majority of this fandom, I guess not!
You boys are about as immature as your teenaged part of the fandom rn. Looking like a couple of 14yo to me.. @zaynmalik @Louis_Tomlinson <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>üèª
@WildBludger tbh, the fans started, naughtyboy followed. This time around nb started. But it doesnt even matter who did anymore.
@PatOu_1995 @duchessnjh i dont give a crap about nb they all are as bad as the other.
@WildBludger zayn was just as immature!

depends on ur maturity level
Not siding with anyone #done #moredonethanliamsdone

@ilymharry just keep me out of this shit!
@LeanzaKaren  I believe in doing to others as you would want to have done to youself!
@LeanzaKaren that I don't stand for actions like that. I think it's wrong!
@LeanzaKaren no problem. I'm not insulting anyone, I'm just letting the part of the fandom that attack others in vile/mean ways, +
@ilymharry NB and the way fans are acting. I guess lol :)

@anngiebadilla Still hits hard tho whit all the drama and cheating rumours.
@anngiebadilla yea well i dont blame him, like i have bf too so its not like im heartbroken, lol.
@Nialls_Bra thanks love!
@_lovecurlyhair_ thanks, i just couldnt handle any hate onto this.
@anngiebadilla well, liam was my first tbh. And i know that sounds dirty lol. This niall drama is too much for me rn.
would it be alright if i just turned down my niallgirl side for a while until i come to terms with this, or does that label me as a fake fan
Wtf this shit is getting worse
@Michael5SOS I'll make sure never to get into one with you then shall I <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@lichiannn sure looks like it!
Woke, saw the niall and melissa video, yea its cute but i cant handle it so im out for today, bye

- gets interrupted 
- gets talked over 
- no one pays attention‚Ä¶
<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> doing my head in! Apparantly the lack of explanation on something makes it "not linguistically correct", sorry but what planet are you on?
@PlantaeKin +, he just put a high grade on it..
@PlantaeKin well i thought so at first, but then i learned that instead of pointing out what i did wrong so that i could learn
@PlantaeKin matbe you should stick to english bc youre not making much sense :)
So im a bit upset, my geography teacher should not be a teacher, he tries his best but he's just not cut out to be one.

@voldemole wasnt talking 'bout the movie...

@XeniaTommo1D its on a joined acc, im not the only one on it. So no! Respect that!
@XeniaTommo1D its on a joined acc an that acc isnt the one with his follow, so i cant do that.
@hesbambi sadly it is <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@hesbambi plus i dont feel like i earned it bc i didnt get his follow, i dont have his "permission"
@hesbambi yea its not that, its tht everyone spam them so mch even more since these group things.
@TheMaudness right!
@hesbambi i guess, doesnt feel right tho so idk if ill ever use it.
@hesbambi i have a joined acc and somehow my friend managed to get ito a group dm
Apparantly i have access to dm harry, but i dont feel like i should use it bc it doesnt feel like i earned it.. Am i weird or just dumb, idk
<HORSE FACE><SNOWFLAKE>Ô∏è 
@Fuckiess it happens :)
@Fuckiess my familys, mainly my mums :)

#Happy21stBirthdayHarry 
Today is not a normal day, today is harrehs birthday<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> Happy Birthday cupcake @Harry_Styles , have a good one!!<BALLOON><PARTY POPPER><BALLOON>#HappBirthdayHarryStyles
@MissPBSH yes bc this is just pathetic!
@MissPBSH right, ever! I wouldnt spam them either. Just the occasional dm or tweet just like now. Damn!
@BenPhillipsUK will you get me the milk?
@MissPBSH ugh, people are so immature. Like where do you get these ideas to get into a groupchat to send hate. Wtf
@MissPBSH are people sending them hate?
@MissPBSH they probably was before, but im certain its worse now.
@AwkwardlyWeird4 awh :/ well good!
@MissPBSH Plus imagine how many of them that use it to ask for follows....
@MissPBSH yes i do too tbh, i dont want them to get even more spammed there too.
Even though i know ive never been in one with them, not even a single one...
I mean normal tweets fine, but dms doesnt feel right.... we all know he asked not to get spammed... I feel bad about these group things tbh
Since group dms are a thing now, i have a feeling a lot of fans are going to spam harry tomorrow and i dont really like the thought of it...
@Greghoran87 so cute daddie and son <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
