@nooraamomoali aw thank you, and you too i'A xx
@sameeaalam thank youu, you too i'A&lt;3
@reshmaaaab &lt;333
sleep pls
enough of psycho revision on twitter lool im done with this, maybe some more with Unit 2 i'A
i have an appointment early tomorrow i should sleep
@sameeaalam i guess so lol x
@TuRehndex @sameeaalam loool&lt;3 if it makes sense in ur head, its not hard, so im okay with it lool x
there are some strengths and weakness which i can honestly not remember so need to work on that
Effects of separation- affectionless psychopathology, depression and deprivation dwarfism x
@wasimahakhtar I've finished memory rev lool sorry!x
@sameeaalam lool ily ty! xxx
@wasimahakhtar lool its okayyy, youll get throughh! xx
Robertson and Robertson provided evidence for the PDD model bc of the young kids and how they reacted upon separation
@wasimahakhtar loool, i work best after 1am, idek why but i feel more energetic! And, that sounds really cool x
my sister just called me a retard for tweeting my psycho revision:(
during separation- protest, despair and detachment
Attachment can be disrupted by separation or deprivation (bsclly taken away or not formed at all)
@wasimahakhtar LOL whyy
if 12 marker comes up on Genie, then ily aqa examiner ppls x
However sometimes more variation can occur in different parts of a country compared to being in a different country
Cultural Differences make things difficult bc different cultures have different values and behaviours hence not generalisable
@xNailaBx LOL no problem! and thank you omds!&lt;3
pls dont be tweeting love shit on my tl, so moist man ffs
@nooraamomoali revision cards help! I have a friend who does Law and she uses revision cards all day errday lool, good luck i'A&lt;3
Oh i love the names Van ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg lool but yeah, meta analysis of 32 countries- evidence for S.Situation x
@Kiiirannnn lool sorryyy, feel for you! good luck i'A xxx
@nooraamomoali loool just dm a freshie and just talk to urself and it'll help lool x
Ainsworths Strange situation results: type A/B/C - 15%, 70% and 15%, respectively x
@nooraamomoali i know most of it but its rehearsal so yeah its helping lol :)
Types of attachment- secure, insecure avoidant, insecure resistant
why do i see this girl flirting and not revising pls. double astagfirullah man
Infants use mother as a safe base to explore environment- strong, secure attachment
@KIYXNI haha, revise innit!!
@KIYXNI I didnt know that piece of research, thanks for that haha :)
i need sleep
this is requiring too much energy which i dont have atm omds
if attachment not formed during CP, child may be damaged physically, emotionally, intellectually and socially
Critical Period of about 7months to 3 years roughly i guess
Monotropy- having one special attachment usually with biological mother as said by Bowlby x
Lorenz- Geese- imprinting during critical period of a few hours
Same with Schaffer and emerson with their infants who were attached to whoever was the most sensitive and loving
However Harlows monkeys contradict this bc of monkeys attachment to cloth mother, not wire feeding mother
Learning theory for attachment; Classical conditioning and Operant where desire to be close to caregiver bc of pleasure linked to food given
Attachment is a strong emotional bond between infant and caregiver. Desire to be close/distress when separated/pleasure when reunited cx
Oh bloody hell, my hands hurt from typing and my eyes r ded
OK FIRST PART COMPLETE X MOVING ONTO ATTACHMENT X
Strategies for memory: chunking, organising, context, mnemonics and imagery eg method of loci, etc x
C.Interview - basically recreate the situation and in different order and perspective to gain full view and provide accurate testimony x
Thennn a cognitive interview was developed for accuracy by Geiselman et al which was very effective- especially RWA x
EWT= RWA bc of police questioning EW's for when a crime occurs
Loftus again- weapon focus effect- pen with grease/ knife with blood- EW's mostly looking at knife not face so unreliable
Accuracy was performed by Yarmey( i think?) and Valentine and Coxon with age me thinks?
Loftus and Zanni was the 'a' and 'the' for the broken glass observed
Loftus and Palmer- Eyewitness Testimony aka the car crash ting with the hit/smash/collided/bumped/contacted n broken glass
Ok all i know is how to criticise it: the central executive is too vague and simplistic but KF is evidence for its existence
i fucking hate the working memory model it makes no sense to me. If a 12 marker comes up on it, im done with life bye ta
Fam yall best be using these notes. its helping me but ok lols carry on me x
MSM evidence- primacy and recency effect and ppl with korsakoffs syndrome. Limits= oversimplified and cant be really related to RL
I meant MSM fml
MMS is sensory, STM, then LTM upon rehearsal at every point otherwise it will be easily forgotten if not processed on a deeper level x
Jacobs and Miller studied capacity of STM to find 7+ or - 2 was how much it can hold (9-5 slots bsclly)
@KIYXNI omg thank you so much! :)
Bahrick investigated VLTM's by asking ppl to remember names of classmates and accuracy increased therefore LTM duration=unlimited x
Peterson and Peterson investigated the duration of the STM with the trigrams and interference task. 3sec-80% 18secs-10% so limited capacity
Milner conducted the case study of HM who had brain surgery. his STM was good but LTM was affected- evidence for separate stores x
haha x 
@wasimahakhtar thank you, you too xx
@PrickAbzi :( im revising stahp
natural experiments do, however, have high ecological validity but confounding variables can affect results hence unreliable
Natural experiments are used in naturally occurring situations where obs are made however little control and not very reliable
@wasimahakhtar i'A make sure you do lool x
Field experiments take place in natural settings therefore have more ecological validity however there is less control of other variables
@wasimahakhtar loool omg reviseeee :D
Lab experiments are reliable as they are replicable because high levels of control however there have low ecological validity so peak times
no, actually page 6 looool im so shit at this
ok wait its page 8 first ty x
@wasimahakhtar memory and attachment x
ok turn to page 9 of ur cgp aqa revision guides guys and girls
