straight men who go to an ed sheeran concert and aren't afraid to shout "i love you ed" give me life you are gr8
at itunes 2014 ed sheeran said 'i dont want you to sing' and you couldnt hear a pin drop, how he can command a crowd like that is beyond me
the best experience of my life is when i was off my face watching ed sheeran and he played bloodstream it was like a spiritual journey
i played @edsheeran for my cat - she meowed, then sat down, and gave me a massive kiss on my arm. i think she likes him. :')
can @edsheeran release a live album/dvd or something holy shit that man is the bane of my life i love him so much

@JuztYvonne the more we talk about it the more it's becoming noticed and abolished. that's what we wanted. and it's working. :)
@JuztYvonne our generation have had to learn for ourselves. about racism, sexism, homophobia.. we're trying to punch those away from society
my own coming out was easy, but for many it can be extremely difficult and i'm glad youtube (and people like @ConnorFranta) are a resource.
@JuztYvonne "on"? well, forwards. you get what i mean though, right? haha.
@JuztYvonne it's amazing! we as a society are finally moving on and connor is an amazing role model

@danisnotonfire looks like something from outlast what the fuck
@sam_deville if you're told the colour blue is green for long enough you're going to think it's green.
@sam_deville rape isn't a joke, though. and by making jokes like that it makes it (or at least makes people think) that it is acceptable.
hozier is amazing
@itsjonnywilson rude. i was just having a civilized discussion but it seems like you can't handle it. aw boo hoo.
@sam_deville of course it's become normalized - the fact people LAUGHED when he said it already proves my point.
@itsjonnywilson people need to talk about what he did and why it was wrong. it needed to happen.
@itsjonnywilson maybe not but the conversation about the culture surrounding what he said has to start somewhere..
@sam_deville nothing to do with feminism - normalizing something that's already way too normalized in britain by 'lad culture' isn't funny.
@itsjonnywilson testing boundaries &amp; normalizing something that's already too normalized in britain by 'lad culture'? two different things.
honestly getting as bad as @danisnotonfire with maltesers now. my dad'll bring me a bag home after work without me even asking he's a bae

absolutely fucking crying!!! i've changed my language to 'lolzcat' or something and i'm PISSING MYSELF
@erin_m01 he is homophobic because he's got a massive problem with people even IMPLYING he's gay. 100% a homophobe.
@erin_m01 OH MY GOD. i didn't "call you names" you've got to be joking. this is why i hate directioners. leave me alone, yeah? #annoying
@erin_m01 i'm not hating on him. hating and stating facts are two different things. i stated a FACT. he IS homophobic.
@erin_m01 he is not homophobic? it's not the first time he's said something implying he is and it won't be the last.
@erin_m01 if you're 18 and sending me tweets like this you obviously have a learning difficulty or a mental illness or something.
@erin_m01 oh my god what are you, 10? him being a homophobe is disgusting. "hes done nothing to u" he offended me, actually.
@Glowpinkstah if you're in the UK, try newlook! they have a range called "inspire" which is plus sized and go up to a size 32(UK).
@Louis_Tomlinson seems like such a homophobe <UNAMUSED FACE>. i read the article and it said he 'supported gay rights' not that he was actually gay.

#philisnotonfire6 re-enact your fave scene from high school musical hahaha
@AmazingPhil I AM NOT OKAY I'M SO EXITED I DON'T THINK U UNDERSTAND
best moment of my life was when @edsheeran played 'bloodstream' and i was standing there watching him high as a kite. what an experience.
i love this song because it's educational (and catchy), it's about breaking gender roles 
if u search "tall lesbian" into google images the first few things that come up are of @danisnotonfire i don't know weather to laugh or cry
don't forget autumn internationals start next week (v important if you're welsh) #rugby #wales
#thanksforeverythingdanandphil we love ya.
is it only me who thinks eminem is really attractive? like everyone seems to think he's ugly as fuck but i think he's hot tbh
i don't smoke crack motherfucker i sell it, i'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of elvis
recognized @BarclayBeales face a mile off. first thought when i saw him in the group is of the yodeling, tho. it's ingrained in my memory.
@D3_585crPK_650 it's one village!
this is literally the best thing i have ever seen haha 
why does @TPAIN even use auto tune? he doesn't fucking need it at all!! 
can someone explain to me why everyone hates nickelback, i know "rockstar" was a monstrosity but you know the lyrics even now so it worked
I LOVE BLACK @BlkStoneCherry AND I WANT TO SEE THEM AGAIN OKAY (ALSO WHEN I SAW THEM LAST CHRIS LOOKED LIKE CHRIS GRIFFIN THAT WAS COOL)
@Dynamomagician trick tbh
@danisnotonfire my biggest fear is other human beings tbh
@AmazingPlnil (i totally agree btw)
@AmazingPlnil haha you're a genius
i have a driving lesson and need to get my shit together but all i wanna do is stay in bed and watch @danisnotonfire &amp; @AmazingPhil videos
it's weird how i know how to dance to the ketchup song but don't know the lyrics they're so confusing i'm just like "aserejehihihasotkthkr"
i don't know weather or not to be worried about @danisnotonfire
@AmazingPhil needs to keep his stubble. that's all.

why the fuck is someone going around giving @danisnotonfire &amp; @AmazingPhil's address out. that's not okay. this is why i hate people.
can we talk about how good @danisnotonfire looks in the new sims video though holy fucking shit
my cat was trying to climb over me and literally stood on my forehead way to fucking go cat
because one day, i'll leave you, a phantom, to lead you in the summer, to join the black parade
it's cool that the sap is back like whatever i'm over it but the fact they used @danisnotonfire's ending is not fucking ok like ew
"play" by moby is my fave album by him though like wow so good
it's so weird how my dad can go from pink floyd to moby to supertramp wow calm down dad (although i'm glad he introduced me to good music)
i might watch @danisnotonfire's liveshow but then again i might listen to more moby cos i've missed this music u feel
oh how i've missed listening to moby
give it to me baby like boom boom boom
@danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil that's literally the most domestic thing i've ever seen
please tell me you did not just say "insert it into him" @danisnotonfire
the first YT video i ever watched was fred loses his meds by @FredFigglehorn/@LucasCruikshank! i was 13 years old. bless. #nostalgia
sorry but there's absolutely no reason not to be informed about trans* issues.(fyi i find @Alex_Bertie's videos really helpful!)
sorry but i'm disgusted at @ArielleIsHammin asking tara if she was pre or post op. it's nobody's fucking business.
aw i miss the film bandslam, i need to watch it more often. it was one of my fave films as a teenager
literally all my friends i've met on nights out. if i didn't go out i wonder how many friends i'd have left? 0. that's sad. i'm lonely.
a few weeks ago i gave a massive hickey to some random boy on a night out. we ended up becoming friends. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
let me be your 'leccy meter and i'll never run out, and let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

@LOHANTHONY's videos are like my major guilty pleasure tbh <MOVIE CAMERA><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@AmazingPhil your new video was so cute and creative

i love amy winehouse, i wish she was still with us! 27 club, baby. some of the greatest artists of all time are in the 27 club..
i wanna be friends with @FrankieCocozza tbh, he's so fucking funny
@robbiejayy sweet soul is so smooth fucking hell.. it reminds me of chocolate or good sex or red wine or something DAYYYMMM
my life basically revolves around music, it makes me happy
@robbiejayy's originals always make me feel nostalgic, i've been listening to them all for such a long time! :-) they're always the best
i'd sell my soul to see bo burnham live tbh
#MyLoveLifeIn3Words Non. Fucking. Existent.

damien rice is bringing out a new album? well fuck
can @edsheeran &amp; @samsmithworld collab? after seeing them both live that would be a fucking powerhouse of a song tbh! i need it in my life
if a band covers a pink floyd song they should be obligated to do the talking bits inbetween!! makes the songs come alive more:-) #pinkfloyd

does anyone remember katy perry doing this bc i can't 
happy 5 years of video making, dan! @danisnotonfire :-)
five nights at freddys and slenderman are both brilliant... but terrifying. idk if i want to play them or not.
some bands first albums are the best and they peak too early which sucks :/ (starsailor, counting crows to name but a few)
wanna see starsailor live again tbh, it was nice cos as they were playing my dad was telling me stories about when he saw them years ago..
@w4hband you guys fucking owe me cos @SabsW4H2345 just rung me at 5AM to talk about your gig..i shouldn't be up at this ungodly hour!!! :')
so @SabsW4H2345 just fucking rung me at 5am to talk about @DazW4H.. you both owe me for making me get up at this ungodly hour!!! x
lmao 
as if she isnt cute 
i wonder if @danisnotonfire or @AmazingPhil are awake (it's almost 2AM).. they're always saying how they're night owls <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
the 27 club is important..don't forget. if you don't know about it/ what it is we can't be friends <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>..

gutted i didn't see them in 2005..nah pink floyd nah <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
my love for pink floyd will never die.. as much as i hate waters as a person his era of the band is my fave? <UNAMUSED FACE>
the final cut by waters? nah. good singles but kinda shitty album as a whole (sorry) <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
if you haven't seen the film of the wall by pink floyd you should watch it, tells the story of the album! you understand it so much more
wish you were here's cover art where the man is shaking hands with the man with the flame suit on is incredible?
comfortably numb!! YEEES
why didn't waters &amp; gilmour fucking help syd though? they just left him <CONFUSED FACE> as much as i love them they're massive twats? waters especially..
as much as i love pink floyd.. waters was an absolute twat <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
"drugs are bad" yeah but 99% of the greatest artists of all time took them - hendrix, floyd, the beatles, ian dury, need i say more?
watching "discovering: pink floyd", i fucking love pink floyd<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
i love @PaulAkister, @AndreaFaustini1, @JakeQuickenden, @Bhaenow &amp; @JayJames! love the lads this year <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> amazing!!
jake's gotta be the one who goes through or i'm gonna go nuts @JakeQuickenden #xfactor
the thinking out loud video by @edsheeran is the one of the  most beautiful things i've seen in a long time.. wow!
“@danisnotonfire: my creativity seems to come in short intense bursts at all once i think i will call them 'writingasms'” same tbh
idk why but i think @PaulAkister is so sexy, that hair and face and voice <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

i'm so poorly today, boo fml <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
important q when it comes to your OTP: which one gives the other a drunk lap dance?<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> (i have my own ideas when it comes to #troyler/#phan <WINKING FACE>)

fucking hell @PattyxWalters is amazing. i. just. can't. even. NO. speechless.
hi <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
gonna watch high school musical wow i'm such a dork/loser/child i s2g
i've decided i've had enough of youtube, i'm going to take a step back while all this is happening. it's really frightening and horrifying.
"let’s play a game called guess which youtuber is going to fuck up next"
"@thetomska: 5 down, 2 to go." this honestly scares the shit out of me but i'm glad it's not being swept under the carpet, tbqh
i'd sell my soul to see @coldplay live to be quite honest. (and so would my parents, we've agreed)
if you diss pink floyd i immediately hate you. uuuuuuugh. get out.
your new video stressed me out through the screen so i can't imagine what it must have been like IRL <FLUSHED FACE><FLUSHED FACE> @danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil
@bookofeli_sha @danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil their fans can't handle all the phan basically, their poor hearts hahaha
@bookofeli_sha @danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil nah basically they're doing the whole "phan" shit like you can feel the gay
@XoxoErinElena he's sexually harassed, assaulted, and RAPED multiple girls, not one, but MULTIPLE. it's not even about the video anymore.
so can @rickygervais make an idiot abroad reunion pls? it would be spectacular, it always had me in stitches <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
i miss an idiot abroad tbh
heavy metal broke my...

HEART
goes to party with many youtubers, hangs with own flatmate hahaha @danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil bless ur souls
@danisnotonfire bless ur souls
@RossJenkins1 tbh he should be arrested, not only is it disgusting but also illegal
@RossJenkins1 he tried to pass it off as a social experiment to highlight the fact it happens to men too... U WOT
@RossJenkins1 what made it worse was that he tried to cover his own ass and say it was a "social experiment"
@RossJenkins1 it's disgusting so the whole youtube community has basically boycotted him
@RossJenkins1 it's everything from asking for nudes, touching w/o consent to rape
@RossJenkins1 people have claimed that sam has sexually harassed/assaulted and raped them
@RossJenkins1 and now there have been hundreds of allegations towards sam by girls
@RossJenkins1 so the youtube community (massive names like tyler oakley, etc) stood up and were like "we won't take this shit"
@RossJenkins1 basically sam put up a video touching girls bums without consent (sexually harassing them) and everyone was disgusted
@ShaanLouiese she made a video - everyone should always believe a rape victims claims until proven otherwise..so i believe her.
i watched the video where the young woman was anally raped by sam pepper and i'm absolutely disgusted beyond words. put him in jail. NOW.
i literally cannot cope with this what the fuck is wrong with your fans??? hahahaha  @danisnotonfire 
@12YrOldDan i literally cannot cOPE WITH THIS TWITTER ACC WHAT THE FUCK
@boburnham REPEAT STUFF IS ICONIC CONGRATULATIONS
if anyone in future asks me what 'sarcasm' is i'll just send them @boburnham's new video hahahaha
both @PointlessBlog &amp; @JimsTweetings have done #HeForShe and this is why we love them! yaaaaaas go on boys &lt;3
@YoutubersBattle @gogreen18 i somehow really doubt youtube would be shut down..
seriously what the fuck is wrong with sam pepper? if he truly thought what he did was wrong he wouldn't have threatened @gogreen18 ..

just :) to :) make :) it :) clear :) i :) do :) NOT :) support :) sam :) pepper :) he :) is :) a :) cunt :)
@sampepper no they're not someone who used to be your PA told everyone it is you and your email address. BUSTED. shut the fuck up.
@tyleroakley @danisnotonfire oh my fucking god tyler hahhahaha slay
@danisnotonfire you are the queen <CROWN> (does that make phil the king tho or not?)
stuff i used to say ironically but now can't stop saying: yaaas, m8, u go girl, literally, no but yeah
tumblr is so addictive, once you get into the hole you can't escape
i fucking called it!!! the guy from 'kitten &amp; the hip' was ashley from freak power i even told my parents and they laughed but i was right <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
REMEMBER I SAID THAT THE BLOKE IN 'KITTEN &amp; THE HIP' FROM X FACTOR REMINDED ME OF THE GUY FROM FREAK POWER TURNS OUT IT IS ACTUALLY HIM WTF<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
by "again" i mean i've always hated him, tweeted him saying it was good he brought an issue to the light and now hate him again
nah i actually hate sam pepper again now that i've seen people come forward about their experiences with him
in the lonely hour by sam smith is on i feel so chilled out his voice hnnnnnnnnnng
@danisnotonfire @howellcliche the sass though hahahaha oh my god daniel
@danisnotonfire is literally becoming the queen of sass, he'll never be tyler oakley but he's pretty close ngl
@ShorelineDimins @booguerrero19 @sampepper how did you even come to that conclusion?
@ShorelineDimins @booguerrero19 @sampepper no of course not? when did i say that?
@booguerrero19 @cantsurfwithus i never said it WAS okay
@booguerrero19 @11thGorgeous nope, what?

@tyleroakley #asktyleranything have you seen the blurry troyler edits bECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FUCKING OKAY MY FEELS (-:
#burrbearsasktanya @TanyaBurr if you could invent a new flavor for ice cream what would it be &amp; why? :)))
@tyleroakley #asktyleranything if you could invent a new flavor for ice cream what would it be &amp; why bae? :)))
@UCanTouchMyHalo no youtube took it down because 99% of people asked them too, including other youtubers
things i wish that wouldn't happen but are: @danisnotonfire &amp; @AmazingPhil making a brand out of their "ship". long sigh. loud sigh. sigh.
@TippyProfile yeah he trended in the UK and US i believe, and then worldwide (like 99% of tweets were negative which i'm glad of) (-:
@TippyProfile he's been trending worldwide over the last few days on and off..
i like @JackHoward &amp; @DeanDobbs cos 1) they're actually funny and 2) they're respectful and 3) they're both pretty cute their faces wow (-:
@ornacunningham i think the worst part (at least for me) is the fact that his young male viewers are going to think this is okay..
@ornacunningham me either, did he not at any stage think 'wow, what i'm doing is wrong', it must have crossed his mind surely <ANGRY FACE>??
@MyNamesChai @sampepper YAAAS CHAI DRAG HIM. <OK HAND SIGN> SO MANY SHOTS FIRED
@ornacunningham they probably did but he edits his own videos remember, he wants to make it look like what he did was "okay"
@charlieskies OMFG
@shanedawson sigh, stuff like that can permanently damage a woman's mental health and well-being, but that's ok it's a "prank" right smh
@tyleroakley @troyesivan haVE YOU SEEN THE BLURRY TROYLER EDITS BECAUSE OH MY FUCKING GOD THEY'RE LEGIT AMAZING (-:
BASICALLY I FUCKING LOVE @MrRepzion LIKE YESSSS PREACH IT <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@AlbertShilling he's a grown fucking man. an adult. he knows right from wrong. he's not impaired or disabled in any way. he clearly knew.
@oakley_fanpage yeah many many youtubers have spoken up about it. i'm so proud /thankful of the community as a whole! :)
@AlbertShilling it's an issue that needs to be addressed. it's a good thing people are discussing it.
if ya want "funny" go &amp; watch @JackHoward &amp; @DeanDobbs not @sampepper. jack &amp; dean do comedy in the right way &amp; they're super respectful (-:
@troyesivan yESSSSS TROYE <OK HAND SIGN>
@gogreen18 @JackHoward YESSSSS JACK BAE <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> so many youtubers have signed it holy shit. laci you go gurl!!!
@Lewis_YNWA it wasn't a prank! pranks are funny or a joke. making women feel uncomfortable isn't a joke for the participant or viewer
@Lewis_YNWA we feel violated and disgusting about ourselves even tho men think it's a "compliment"
@Lewis_YNWA it happens so often. people touching, cat calling, creeps on the street, it's kinda.. well.. not nice. at all. it hurts.
@Lewis_YNWA but then making it legal would also put strain on the nhs so tax it all they want but like i don't know it's complicated
@Lewis_YNWA but on the other hand prices would go up because they'd have to keep profit the same bc greedy
@Lewis_YNWA say the timber ind. pay £100 per tree + make £500 from paper sales, that's £400 profit. say weed (cont) 
@Lewis_YNWA but the industries that are open are greedy. they don't want to compete.
@Lewis_YNWA everything would go up in price because cannabis would be so cheap to make those things out of
@Lewis_YNWA yeah but cannabis is a cheaper alternative, so they'd make money but not enough
@Lewis_YNWA natural energy that could be turned into oil to power cars, it can make plastic, bricks..all those industries would fail
@Lewis_YNWA not as much because weed can make everything from paper, rope, net, flags, blankets..
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove tampering with evidence and charged with perverting the course of justice
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove the evidence is right there in front of you. if they were to give opinions in court instead of fact they'd be
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove yeah but in evidence there is no opinions. only fact. what sam pepper did was sexual assault, that's fact.
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove weed is illegal because industries would fail! loosing millions of pounds
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove weed can make everything from natural energy to paper.
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove weed is illegal because the timber industry would fail if it were legal, millions of pounds would be lost
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove if alcohol and cigs were invented now they'd be banned. it's only because they've been around for thousands of years
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove because "innocent until proven guilty", they show facts and if they're proven guilty they get charged straight away
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove no one should sexually assault, regardless of gender. if a woman did it to a man that wouldn't be okay either.
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove there's no "deeming" involved, it states in the law. there's no "opinion" only "fact".
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove yes but there's this thing called "reporting it". you don't tend to report your friends to the police..
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove in my eyes you're a misogynistic sexist lowlife so the answer would be "no".
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove under the law, yes, BUT THEY WEREN'T HIS FRIENDS THEY WERE STRANGERS.
@Danny_Dove @Lewis_YNWA don't be so fucking blind.
@Danny_Dove @Lewis_YNWA a nervous "can i kiss you?" will actually win you more points. girls like it.
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove actually, yes you do. girls actually respect/like you more if you ask.
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove and then they just fucking carry on and rape you. the girl even said "i don't like that" but he CARRIED ON ANYWAY
@Lewis_YNWA @Danny_Dove ask anyone who's been raped including me and that's how rape starts. they do things without consent (like pinching)
@Lewis_YNWA READ IT. IT'S ABOUT SEXUAL TOUCHING. HE BROKE THE FUCKING LAW.
@Lewis_YNWA they weren't 'pinched', it was a violation of their rights and their body! it was without consent.  
@Lewis_YNWA and? AND? really? potential rapist alert! seriously, if someone told you "no" you'd be the type to carry on anyway, right?
@Lewis_YNWA you've got to be fucking KIDDING ME.
@Lewis_YNWA 1 in 6 women get sexually assaulted, it happens every two minutes. survey in 2012 found that out of 1609 women, 10% been raped.
@Lewis_YNWA it happens all too often. women are told they have to like all "attention" from men regardless. they start to believe it.
@Lewis_YNWA they were uncomfortable. women are scared that if they react they'll get verbally abused, physically abused, raped.
@Lewis_YNWA it was sexual harassment and it's illegal in both britain and the US. the girls were visibly uncomfortable. it's not funny.
@pointlesszjm 
@chuckshurleys he touched girl's bums without their consent. that's sexual harrassment. some of the girls even said 'i don't like that'.
@cryztallize don't forget he edits his own videos, some of the girls probs did but he wanted to make it look like what he was doing is okay
sam pepper needs to delete that video and make a formal apology. he has influence and needs to remember that. what he did was WRONG.
@Radcliffefever_ a 'prank video' apparently (although i don't see the prank/what's funny about it)
@Love2_Love1D yeah he's disgusting and i'm glad people are finally seeing it tbh
@hoodwhitesides_ yeah he's disgusting and i'm glad people are finally seeing it tbh
@ode_to_dream_ it's still sexual harassment regardless of gender, it still would have been disgusting and wrong
@O2LBaabes and also, it's ILLEGAL. sexual harassment isn't funny.
@O2LBaabes what he did wasn't a prank - it was sexual harassment. imagine if it triggered one of those girls who'd had a bad past.
@Love2_Love1D he touched girl's bums without their consent. that's sexual harrassment. some of the girls even said 'i don't like that'.
@Radcliffefever_ he touched girl's bums without their consent. that's sexual harrassment. some of the girls even said 'i don't like that'.
@hoodwhitesides_ he touched girls bums without consent. sexual harassment. some of the girls even said 'i don't like that' but he didnt stop
@sgtbarness he touched girl's bums without their consent. that's sexual harrassment. some of the girls even said 'i don't like that'.
sam pepper is absolutely fucking disgusting. he has influence over young minds and they're going to think that it's okay and IT'S NOT.
@JackHoward FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT!! he's such a shitty person to stoop that low for a prank/views tho! why did he think that would be ok?
this is pretty much what we all think of you @danisnotonfire 
@danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil what i'm wondering is who sold their soul for all this content? like DAMN :)))
haven't eaten in 2 days oops i keep forgetting
"To believe in one's dreams is a manifestation of insanity. And the sooner you accept this, the sooner you'll get well."
@danisnotonfire @AmazingPhil i don't think the phandom can handle the amount of phan. they're at each others throats with anti-proof/proof..
read about @lizziCunningham &amp; @fuckubecky, the first thing i did was smile &amp; say "you go girls!" very loudly, had so many weird looks oops<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@danisnotonfire if you upload today it'll be 9 days in a row of shit from you and phil (vids &amp; liveshows) mayaswell start daily vlogging tbh
catching up on @Joe_Sugg's vlogs watching bestival one and sOMEONE TAKE ME BACK TO V FEST HOLY FUCK. cant wait for next years fest season:))

@danisnotonfire did you even realize what you said with the pigs spit roasting because you need to learn to fucking control yourself daniel
casually waiting for the day when dan and phil realise that they're perf for each other, it's so frustrating
@tyleroakley i sometimes have to remind myself how short you are it's so cute wtf i'm literally dying i can't even
@troyesivan @tyleroakley watch this its so cute 
yestarday me n my dad were in the car blasting out creep by radiohead and singing w/ the windows down and we had so many funny looks i s2g

relapsed
@shankney we would joke around TOGETHER. it wasn't a one sided thing.
@shankney fine if i did though it was because i was in on the joke? we were talking? not indirectly..
@shankney not when i'm being funny/joke-y/nice to you i haven't
@shankney that wasn't a joke? that's a personal attack on me.
@shankney "learn to take a joke" what exactly were you "joking" about then? because frankly i don't see.
@shankney calling someone disgusting names and telling them to "die" isn't a joke.
@shankney i still don't understand why you're being so nasty? you used to be tidy/nice to me before. i didn't do anything to deserve it
@shankney don't even care. why are you being nasty? you used to be tidy to me? idgi
@shankney clearly are delusional if you think i'm crying? sheep shagger? ye my girlfriend's a sheep n wot?
@shankney and how would you know? if you think i'd cry over you YOUR the delusional one
@shankney do you think i actually care if you and your friends think i'm ugly? you've got a massive head if you actually think i give a shit
@shankney so what if i am? i think i look nice, and a few other people in the world are bound to and even if they don't? i'm happy
@shankney because it's not an objective view. if they're your friends they're not going to give an unbiased opinion on me
@shankney i said someone who isn't your friend are you thick?
@rossjenkins @shankney sorry pal!
@shankney @RossJenkins1 you're not confident you're cocky and egotistical there's a difference
@shankney @RossJenkins1 people with big ego's are generally lacking something.. i'm guessing with you it's a small dick or something.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 nah, i love myself! no one - especially not you - can change that! you've got such a big ego.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 how am i "disgusting?" and nah i won't :) i LOOOOVE myself!
@shankney @RossJenkins1 i'd rather be "delusional" than hate myself. been there, done that. i'm over it.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 unlike you who clearly have issues to be as nasty as you are, i love myself and how i look..
@shankney @RossJenkins1 have actually. sometimes i stand in my mirror and look at myself and think "wow, i look good today". confidence see.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 why would i cry? i don't cry over ugly people i cry over pretty ones lol xoxo
@shankney @RossJenkins1 i'm not crying i'm laughing at how much of a nasty person you are? i'm laughing bc i'm better than you?
@shankney @RossJenkins1 i can't really express sarcasm on twitter - doesn't quite work as well.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 what i mean is i'm quite 'dull' on twitter? in real life i'm sarcy, funny, and the class clown.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 i don't even care. just don't talk about me indirectly. that's not fair. at least let me fight my own corner.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 "so you act to make people like you" no? but in real life i'm different.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 2013? i've changed. unlike you. you're still a complete and utter cunt. you're horrible.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 twitter is not an accurate representation of someone's personality lmao. are you thick?
@shankney @RossJenkins1 you know OF me. you don't know what my personality is like. you can't know someone through twitter.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 how am i annoying? you don't even know me.
@shankney @RossJenkins1 that's actually not nice, though? i'm not annoying. i'm actually a tidy person? i don't deserve that at all..
@shankney @RossJenkins1 i'm welsh and a lesbian? those are accurate words to describe me.
"@shankney: @RossJenkins1 loool the annoying bitch? Check my fb friends she should be on there somewhere" thanks hun. #cunt
@shankney @DubbleJord @RossJenkins1 you're still all knobs i see <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> haven't changed at all
@RossJenkins1 @shankney stop talking about me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
get out of bed and come on skype you knob @DazW4H.. i have something funny to show you
@Joe_Sugg literally same
me&amp; @SabsW4H2345 are doing a short story and i literally described sex as "doing the do/frickle frackle" i'M crying<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
kissies <KISSING FACE> 
on a day that me&amp; @SabsW4H2345 have time to skype and look fairly attractive @DazW4H isn't online. swear someone up there has it in for me..
currently singing to @SabsW4H2345 in welsh.. oops
put oasis on for @SabsW4H2345 and she thought it was snow patrol HAHAHA
i love @coldplay BUT ghost stories is the best stuff they've done since a rush of blood.. fantastic album!! (pls dont hate on me omg)
pissing myself at all the responses @danisnotonfire got for 'riding the euphoria' tweet..all your viewers have the same mind! a dirty one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
fun fact: i have a thing for collarbones. (it's not a fetish. ok it is)
I was 5 or 6 when it happened, can't believe it was 13 years ago now. RIP to all the victims! #911anniversary #911attack
@Red4Life77 me either! you can't point a gun at someone and expect it not to kill them!!
@umarsheikh95 i'm one of those people! i just don't think manslaughter is good enough
@umarsheikh95 he could go to jail too but that's unlikely c'mon. those other options aren't good enough. he could walk free..
@umarsheikh95 still don't think that's a good thing though. could get a suspended sen, correctional supervision or financial penalty..
@peteosmont correctional supervision and even a financial penalty. he could techincally walk free.
@peteosmont because it has no min sentence it allows the judge to look at options including jail sentence but unlikely, a suspended sentence
@peteosmont even if he's charged that doesn't mean he'll automatically go to jail. in south africa there's no minimum sentence for it..
manslaughter IS NOT good enough! especially considering there's not a minimum sentence for it in south africa #PistoriusTrial
@Red4Life77 he probably won't go to jail but'll have one of the three other options, or a combination. he might go to jail but unlikely
@Red4Life77 a jail sentence (but i doubt it), a suspended jail sentence, correctional supervision or a financial penalty, or a combination
@Red4Life77 nah culpable homicide is known as manslaughter? in south african law there's no minimum sentence so the judge could look at..
@Red4Life77 (it should still be murder in my opinion, though. you've gotta be kidding)
@Red4Life77 the illegal killing of a person either with or without an intention to kill
@danisnotonfire congrats on 4m! that's like the whole of NZ subscribed to you. massive.
cba to do anything today cuz i feel shit but getting out of the house'll probs make us feel better but effort :(
@DazW4H apparently youre doing a Q &amp; A vid. i have nothing original or cool to ask so my question is: will this be in your video or nah bae?
like dorky/nerdy boys are so cute like lets play xbox and sing shitty pop songs together
dorky boys are so hot
ps. nile rodgers is a fucking god on stage like fuck. me. SO GOOD.
wanna go see sam smith, ed sheeran, starsailor and chic live again. BOO.
in love with seth macfarlane what a handsome motherfucker
(@robbiejayy or anything by sam smith)
@robbiejayy last tweet t'you now, done reminiscing. cringe. BUT you should consider doing an acoustic arrangement of 'touch' by troye sivan!
@robbiejayy but in all seriousness bless my little heart, you were my first 'wow cool a musician' crush! HAHA
@robbiejayy crazy it's almost been 5 years now, when i told you i'd support you 'forever', i kinda meant it! <SMIRKING FACE>
'witch' wow nice spelling there ka
i don't think you understand. i was 14 years old. i can't deal with this. @robbiejayy  
@robbiejayy no but literally i had you on your personal facebook and used to tell you how cute your girlfriend was like c'mon really
@robbiejayy i'm re reading my old fan account tweets i'm literally cringing so much i don't think you understand like what the FUCK
i want to be my 15 year old self again where i'd watch @robbiejayy do the singity song and we'd tweet each other. such cool memories.
kill bill vol 2 <OK HAND SIGN>
hey sky movies, kill bill should NOT be in the 'indie' genre, that's all! the indie genre should be independent non-hollywood-y type films.
@HollyGShore people are stupid! being comfortable in your body/self/sexuality has nothing to do with rape. rape is ALWAYS the rapists fault.
i don't understand the film "as cool as i am".. i just watched it and i get it's a coming-of-age thing but i just don't get it? hahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
want to go on a cool adventure with a musician so we can jam, drive on open roads and eat from restaurants, and drink. that is what i want.
it's world suicide prevention day! please stay alive, babes. stay safe. i love youuuu x
bob marley tho
still in love with @JamesArthur23, casually reminiscing on when i saw him live (twice) :) he's incredible! honestly, go and see him live!
feel like @monicamichaeluk is gonna bring back the "both singing and rapping in songs" thing, like the whole n dubz era coming back round
if you remember this song ur a hero 
i used to listen to @bmthofficial when i was suicidal and depressed (in my good old "emo" days) and i'm getting back into them, FUCK.
i'm obsessed with "touch" by @troyesivan but i'm totally okay with this
mrs. banks song about political equality in the begining of #marypoppins is actually really important..
@danisnotonfire u like centuries or nah?
wanna see ed sheeran again in his own concert tho, as much as i enjoyed V fest i need to see him on his own
rememeber when sleeping selfies were a thing.. we need to bring those back they were so funny

my eyes start to roll to the curl of your lips and the centre of eclipse, in total darkness, i.. i reach out and touch <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #TRXYE
being addicted to dr pepper, ciggarettes and the internet can't be good for me. is 'internet addiction' even a thing?
i need nicotine omg pls send help i'm dying wtf
i've run out of ciggies and i'm skint. WORST. i'm gaspingggg!!!
if you ask me to watch your video i'm probably not going to just a warning
basically however you type on twitter is how you talk in real life (i'm the epitome of this i can prove it)
s t e r e o p h o n i c s <OK HAND SIGN>
@tonywedral YOUR WELSH ACCENT IS THE WORST ONE WHAT
@tonywedral i've just watched your videos, u cute <SMIRKING FACE> (although your accents are shit, i'm howling)
there's only minutes before i drop you off, all we seem to do is talk about sex, she's got a boyfriend anyway <SMIRKING FACE>
wanna start making youtube videos but i'm not cool or interesting enough
is it only me who doesn't give a fuck about the royal baby? like it's not exiting. maybe its coz im welsh but like 'meh'
you know when you get such a bad headache it literally feels like a blood vessel has burst in your brain or something.. that's happening :(
#AskSawyer I have nothing cool or original to ask so here's my question: will this question be in your video or nah?
@JackHoward #JackAndDean If you were handcuffed to a celebrity for a whole 24 hours, who would it be?
all i want is to see my fave bands live but nah karen never gets nice things :( i hate being poor
'film maker' wow nice wording there ka
I respect @JackHoward both as a film maker and as a human being. he's funny but knows when to be serious and those are stunning qualities. <PURPLE HEART>
things that fascinate me: egypt, pharaohs, mummies. people like H. H. Holmes and other serial killings before 1900. cool history stuff.
"moonbeam woman" is so catchy but then i have to remind myself it's about fisting...why the fuck even? #freakpower

don't grow up, it's a trap
best feeling is getting into bed with shaved legs and you can feel how soft the covers of your duvet are

i hope fifa sorts him out! he clearly hasn't learned his lesson yet #BanSuarez
it's shocking what suarez did, it's not the first time he's bitten someone, he needs to learn his lesson cause he clearly hasn't #bansuarez
i wish hayfever tablets would work, perhaps i should go to the doctors to get stronger ones
'cause i'll know my weakness, know my voice, and i'll believe in grace and choice,  and i know perhaps my heart is farce

i really like V. C. Andrews and wanna get all her series but expensive to buy 20 series of books :-( life sucks

i actually think @boburnham is really attractive in a really weird, awkward kinda way. like congrats to his girlfriend, u did good my friend
@Holy_Speed22 it's actually got a deeper message if you listen to it properly.
if you want a laugh: 
someone who's blocked me is tweeting me, can you not? you blocked me for a reason you idiot
saving private ryan always gets me emotional tbh
#inspiration #quote  
hang on so is there a @GotTalent 2014 tour or not? cause they usually do a tour of all the finalists. i wanna see them all! :-(

it's 1.11am and i'm watching bo burnham's ''what'' for what feels like the millionth time, never gets old. i'm in hysterics.
@boburnham ahhh please tour the UK again!!
still can't get over the fact that the knife game song was a thing. sometimes i hate the internet. hahaha
i hate PC or whatever you want to call it. i'm gonna say and do whatever i want, i don't care if i 'appropriate' stuff or offend you.
@pburke1987 @TomRichards89 @westbrookdanni it doesn't matter about looks. love is love no matter age, gender or sexuality. love is special.
@sammrochelle you're so cute and seem so lovely! i hope you and jeydon are happy together for a long time to come. :)

@kelliejxde need to talk to you :( so pissed off!!!
wonder if @TheGigiGorgeous realizes about 'male privilege' considering she was once physically male? i wonder how it affects/affected her?
I AM LITERALLY SO PISSED OFF. HOW SOMEONE CAN DO WHAT THEY DID TO MY A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY IS DISGUSTING.
@JoeyGraceffa #ASKJOEY you were handcuffed to a celebrity for 24 hours.. who would it be &amp; why?
• Horny 
• In there feelings 
• High 
• Drunk 
• Sleeping 
• Hungry 
• On A Social Network 
• Watc…
#happybirthdaydanweloveyou :-) @danisnotonfire
don't understand what the big deal is? it's obvious @westbrookdanni &amp; @TomRichards89 are happy together, leave them be! people are so cruel.
mamgu sounds so much better than nain ugh, it makes me laugh and cringe slightly every time i hear it #welsh
can stevie nicks and florence &amp; the machine sing together on a song already?! that would be INCREDIBLE! @StevieNicks @flo_tweet
hahaha so i put @NEEDTOBREATHE on at an after party, my friends heard their album for the first time &amp; loved them. i'm proud of myself <RELIEVED FACE>
all the saw films scare me but are amazing, such a clever idea, jigsaw has a scary but brilliant mind #saw
scruffy bun for bed, gonna try and sleep ffs :-( 4am and im still WIDE AWAKE!!! 
people i currently hate: jenny mccarthy, tania marshall, and any other knob who's written a book on/about autism who isn't on the spectrum.
forgot how much i loved NCIS season 7 (towards the end), and the start of season 8 with pedro's murder and gibbs dad being a bad-ass #NCIS
watching "austenland" earlier (bit of a weird film tbh?) and could of sworn i knew mrs. wattlesbrook from somewhere then it hit me, DR QUINN
watching old ncis episodes all cuddled up in bed, i'm in my own little world it's actually quite nice ngl <RELIEVED FACE>
i love @jamessmithvocal! what a fantastic voice, i hope he makes it big! i love the whole olden retro thing going on tbh <WHITE SMILING FACE>
so this morning i was hungover and watched #BGTfinal from yestarday, i'm so happy @CollabroGlobal won, even my dad likes them! hahaha
i fucking hate danielle from big brother. doesn't believe in gay marriage and believes in 'traditional gender roles' lmao fuck off would you
:) 
"rihanna's changed" no she hasn't, she's always been 'ghetto' and a fashion icon, its just more pronounced because you're looking for it.

welsh slang meaning disgusting: angin' (hanging), 'umpin, muntin', buzzin', gompin'. just for future reference i use them a lot..
actually think @Miles_Teller is gorgeous not gonna lie. been having a marathon of all the films he's in, the spectacular now is basically me
only went and cut my toe by smashing a plate on it didn't i? i was cutting chicken and it slipped off the counter

people i miss: @megannrichardsx, @kelliejxde, &amp; @alexevanbrown. my life sucks.
#ASKJIM if you had to be handcuffed to a celebrity for 24 hours (dead or alive) who would it be and why?
if you mute "adore you" by miley cyrus it kinda looks like a porno hahahahahah
and basically HERE is a huge "fuck you" to anyone who says i cant/shouldn't wear a bikini cause i'm fat 
@WhiteCollarSuit :-/
@WhiteCollarSuit my dad was a wreck, too! :-/
@WhiteCollarSuit hahahaha i think it's where i take my stubbornness from :') after my mum passed i DEFFO put my dad in his place! poor him
@WhiteCollarSuit exactly, my mother was a stubborn woman, put him in his place i think haha
@WhiteCollarSuit "you're really hot" like c'mon thats the best bit, like c'mon dude really
@WhiteCollarSuit haha, my dad said it to me once and i was like "oh wow dad that's deep"
the 'karma haircut' thing (don't wanna call him a boy/man?) gets better though LMFAO @whitecollarsuit 
@WhiteCollarSuit women are always right, and even when they're wrong.. they're right ;-) hahahha #lifemotto
@WhiteCollarSuit HAHAHAHA! after that my girlfriend got involved and he basically said "what the fuck are you doing with that whale"
@WhiteCollarSuit hahahaha!! what can i say, i'm bossy and feisty and not scared of no one!
this is an old but gold one. absolute gem. one of the more extreme ones but yeah hahahaha @whitecollarsuit  
@WhiteCollarSuit i mean probably but what can i do? it's over social networking, i basically told him where to stick it anyway though haha
@WhiteCollarSuit HAHAHA! but yeah, i get a lot worse, i actually liked that. i thought it was sweet. :-)
@WhiteCollarSuit (a personal favourite of mine "i don't care about your girlfriend, i'll bend you over and you'll love it", charming, lmao!)
@WhiteCollarSuit hahaha my point is don't worry 'bout it! :) good i'm glad.
@WhiteCollarSuit haha i've had worse than "a pretty girl like you", trust me. the good old "i can turn you straight" seems to be popular
@WhiteCollarSuit i don't accept your apology but i forgive you. have a nice day/night and i just hope you learn from this.
@WhiteCollarSuit that word has massive ties to bullying and so many lesbians have committed suicide over slurs like that..
@WhiteCollarSuit just don't use that word in future, yeah? it doesn't make you look cool or edgy it makes people like me cut or commit.
@WhiteCollarSuit you never need to say those words but you do need to say the word dyke, right? i don't think you need to say either.
@WhiteCollarSuit like i said, there should be no "blood disposal"? put a towel down and it's fine. the flow lightens or STOPS. no blood?
@WhiteCollarSuit it's the same as you'd be transphobic if you called a trans* person a "tr***y"?
@WhiteCollarSuit i was actually being sarcastic cause you're still homophobic by calling me a SLUR?
@WhiteCollarSuit what "risk" is there? it'll make her feel better and if you wear a condom there's no chance of anything nasty..
@WhiteCollarSuit you're SUCH a good dude pal friend that you don't even say "no homo", right? am i right?
@WhiteCollarSuit oh wow so big of you to not be offended when a guy hits on you, you're suuuuuuch a good pal, right? such a good dude..
@WhiteCollarSuit it's actually pretty cool. plus it eases cramps, pains, and mood swings
@WhiteCollarSuit and do you want me to explain? if you have period sex right the vagina knows, the flow gets lighter or STOPS COMPLETELY
@WhiteCollarSuit "i take compliments well from them" what does that even mean
@WhiteCollarSuit clearly not doing it right then
@WhiteCollarSuit i've seen it all before, it just confirms that you are infact, homophobic
@WhiteCollarSuit you're doing the TYPICAL homophobic excuse "i have gay friends", you can have gay friends and STILL BE A HOMOPHOBE
@WhiteCollarSuit river, even
@WhiteCollarSuit nah, ahem, when the "riiver runs red" is actually the best time to, "do.. it?"..
@WhiteCollarSuit seriously though, you're homophobic, not cute. sort that shit out. "dyke" isn't slang, it's a SLUR. there's a difference.
@WhiteCollarSuit still not seeing any proof
@whitecollarsuit and FYI, i've had and will continue to get more cat than you'll ever have. "dyke" or not.
@WhiteCollarSuit it would actually be funny if i was straight, but fuck you you homophobic scum
@WhiteCollarSuit you said "more crimes happen to men" vague or not they're still classed as "crimes"
@WhiteCollarSuit "dumb teen" says the 16 year old "aspiring musician" with 0 fans/followers of said "music career"
@WhiteCollarSuit literally talking out of your ass. and "dumb dyke", really? do you even know what a "dyke" is? you ignorant piece of shit
@WhiteCollarSuit i've listed about 10 you retard. and no they don't? abortion doesn't fucking COUNT.
@whitecollarsuit violence against trans women, female genital mutilation, crimes against sex workers
@whitecollarsuit honor killings, domestic violence during pregnancy
@WhiteCollarSuit i think you're talking out of your ass. more crimes happen to women.. like rape, prison rape, domestic violence, robbery
@WhiteCollarSuit so more men are murdered, prison raped, robbed, etc etc? nah i don't fucking THINK SO. PROVE IT.
@WhiteCollarSuit "more crimes happen to men" YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME? like WHAT, then?
@WhiteCollarSuit you're an absolute cunt. "women also need to stop raping men." 1 man out of every 71 gets raped, it's 1 women of every 20.
#filmrecommendation #movierecommendation V for Vendetta. (If you've seen it - good for you, go watch it again! if you haven't WATCH IT NOW)

apparently I'M the mess? hahahha don't make me laugh. @HarryPoland14 
@HarryPoland14 can you read? it says HOT mess. you're so idiotic. picking on someones appearance is a low blow. think of a better comeback.
@HarryPoland14 LMAO, go and choke yourself until you suffocate you waste of space.
@HarryPoland14 why the fuck do you hate on everything/everyone? it doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look like a knob. fuck off.

@Kieran_Doyle i really like your cover! been a while, eh? :)
don't forget you can still text BEAT to 70099 to donate £3, it's the cost of 1 pint. #perspective #cancerawareness #nomakeupselfie
@CR_UK how much have you made by now? the last we heard it was £15,000? that was yestarday, though. hope you update us :)
@EmilyJBest haha sorry :) i should click on things in future!
@EmilyJBest that's entirely on me. sorry, i misunderstood!
@EmilyJBest oh, i didn't actually click on the insta to see the full tag line! 'it serves a good purpose'
@jonshr93 maybe. but maybe try being unbiased and objective in future. especially on a subject like this one..
@jonshr93 social media is MASSIVE and i think it's good people are exploring these avenues to make more money
@jonshr93 i don't think anyone is creating a false image. following a trend is how things work in todays world
@jonshr93 what count as 'right reasons', exactly?
@jonshr93 but regardless of the counter argument, i still think it's a good thing and has raised money for a good cause
@jonshr93 i get where ya coming from but even if they do the selfie &amp; don't donate themselves, someone else will see it and end up donating
i've already donated, if you haven't already.. text BEAT to 70099 to donate to cancer research! #nomakeupselfie 
@jonshr93 any and all money will do good. most people who have done the selfie HAVE DONATED. THAT BY DEFAULT IS DOING GOOD.
@jonshr93 they are doing good. they're sending the link/text number and people are donating, it's 15 grand they didn't have last week..
@jonshr93 £15,000 has been raised because of the trend &amp; the number is growing...not making a difference, eh? nah course not.
@ClodaghMacL £15,000 has been donated so far because of the #nomakeupselfie trend and it's growing... so yeah get your facts straight :)
@chloerobinson_x £15,000 and growing, to be exact! ha ha :-))
TO ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING THE #NOMAKEUPSELFIE IS STUPID, CANCER RESEARCH HAVE RAISED £15,000 AND GROWING! SO PISS OFF #CANCERAWARENESS
