A) it was a terrorist attack 
B) they're just not funny regardless of the surrounding circumstances
I think I'm the only one that doesn't find 9/11 jokes funny.
@claireeeebear18 when are you coming home?
@itsrose1001 darn right I am. I'm gonna get you boi..
@tiaatortilla I had to then <PILE OF POO>
Your hairline is unconstitutional
@tiaatortilla <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SURFER>üèº
@tiaatortilla boy your hairlines a joke
@samisosaaa we are seniors then we are gone. Then=one very long stressful school year full of college applications
Done with five government packets, time to do work on this anthology before bed. I hate my life.
@samisosaaa that's a mighty long "then"
@MLS @dwaynederosario loved watching you throughout your career and especially rooting for you at DC. Best of luck!
The caps lost and I still have hella homework to do. Bad night. <CRYING CAT FACE><POUTING CAT FACE>
That game was so frustrating <CONFUSED FACE>
@BenGHensel @@@
Let's go caps! I was just trying to urge them on.
@Ryan_TheBishop smh not a fan
If this goes to game 7, I can't see the capitals winning.
Why take that penalty? It's so pointless.
The caps don't deserve to win cause they do the stupidest things.
@samisosaaa hbd. Ride on. 
@khigginsss wait who are you?
Good start capitals!!!!
@khigginsss @marywashington
This is a little frustrating.
I have literally hit every light on my way to work.
My elderly dog just fatally wounded a wasp in my house and I couldn't be more proud.
@introvertedHue happy birthday buddy! Hope it was awesome! <SURFER>üèº<SURFER>üèº
@_HEC__ you look great buddy
Everton have some very fickle fans.
I hate New York sports fans so much.

We are having an English party and I've already eaten 6 cookies. It's a good thing I'm not going to UVA or I would contract diabetes.
I'm so excited my brother is coming home tomorrow! #doublethetrouble #doublethefun #pleasedontthinktheseareserioushashtags
@HoTCPR it's honestly like we are the same person

No junior Flores on the u-20 World Cup roster <WEARY CAT FACE> he really didn't impress too well in CONCACAF qualifying.
You're not a hipster
@twelfthyank have they said what time they are announcing the roster?
Let's go Rockets!!!! #Houston #H-town #houstonordie #texan #dontmesswithtexas #countryboy
@nikJ_ fantastic show, he's just my least favorite character
Burakovsky again <WEARY CAT FACE><WEARY CAT FACE><WEARY CAT FACE>
Mark Brendanawicz from Parks and Recreation is literally the worst sitcom character known to man.
Burakovskyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
@milestoocold  
#SeniorYearIn5Words you will all become failures
Messi gave Boateng a stroke
I'm officially in the "Messi&gt;Ronaldo" camp
Only thing that could have made that goal better was if Neymar wasn't on the field
Messi is unreal. Good Lord.
<CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>cause it was AP LITerature and composition!!!
That ap exam was LIT!!!!!
@vickkyjayy me too!!!!!
already looking forward to my after school nap
@cyrus7oh3 congrats man! Do work!
And I have my English exam tomorrow <CRYING CAT FACE>
Geez I'm annoyed
I forgot Bale was even on the field.
I hate when a defender puts his hand up for offsides when they are the one keeping them on.
@_HEC__ yeah I know but I saw something that said people don't like him cause he doesn't bow down to white people and it pissed me off
@_HEC__ I feel you for sure
And cause he beat his wife. That's a pretty big part of it too.
People don't not like Mayweather cause he's black. They don't like him cause he's cocky and flaunts his money whereas Pacqiao is humble.
@Carli_Lynnnn ummmm nooooo
That calculus exam done fried by brain.
@Laxitives_ so proud of the fine young gentleman you've grown in to!!!
Capssss
People sleep on Arsenal too much. They are so much fun to watch and could win the premier league title with a little consistency.
@HoTCPR haha I saw the first one but not the second. That's a good one.
#C3PO
@HoTCPR which one?
These NBC Sports Network announcers are so biased to the Rangers and they barely try and hide it
@itsrose1001 look it up. It's basically like having a beer gut but not too big a beer gut. It stands for dad body.
Just read the stupidest article about the double standards the dad-bod produces...I was hoping it was a joke but it wasn't.
@melendezzzz_ this √Æs awesome. You guys look so good!!!
Teachers are starting to hand out so much work that i don't even know what's due anymore.
@_SpencerLobik peep my tweets. I'll still buy you some Legos or something cool like that.
@QAPhantom exactly. I hate Sunderland with a passion.
Seattle is so much fun to watch, I would love to see them play Sunderland.
Blue is the color, congrats Chelsea!
What is a hokie? I am.
@_SpencerLobik I feel bad then. Like I'm not a man of my word. (And I'm not going to UVA but I'll still tweet that)
@_SpencerLobik hi spencer
@HoTCPR I know <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I wonder but then I'm always excited to watch them play<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Why does Seattle always get to play on Sunday?
9 hour shift starting at 6 am is the anti move.
John Terry? Class act???????? 
@tiaatortilla hbd 
Mayweather's demeanor just pisses me off. Flexing while you're still fighting means you're one cocky mf.
Boxing shouldn't have rounds, the match should only end with a KO.
I really want to visit Edinburgh now.
@C_Vidoli "Catherine why didn't you stand up with all the other safety patrols?"
@C_Vidoli do you want this? 
Do I be responsible and go to bed at a good hour for work tomorrow or stay up and watch The Fight?
That should've been Rooney. And McNair should've scored that.
Why is rvp taking the pk?
I hate announcers, it doesn't have to be intentional, his hand is an unnatural position.
@Lewis_TripleLIV <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>thanks lew
Why is coutinho in the team of the year??? <EYES><EYES><EYES>
@blackkkest what's oc?
Both the caps and Manchester United play at 12:30 <WEARY CAT FACE><WEARY CAT FACE><WEARY CAT FACE>
I need to find somewhere to go for this fight tomorrow
Finally got my drink, things are better now.
Ordered a drink 10 minutes ago and still nothing. I am extremely thirsty. I might be dying.
I'm thirsty as a mf and this waitress is taking 20 minutes on the computer to put my order in
I hate losing. Gotta take positive things from the loss though. More intensity needed.
Extending Bill Hamid's contract is a great foundation for plenty of success in the coming years! #DCU
@samisosaaa except it only cost 6$ to get in and I got you a job so.....you owe me.
@HoTCPR no
I'm so excited for this game tonight.
If anyone beats the buses and can give me a ride home plz hmu..
@juliaaaa_ann you must really like early 2000 alternative rock!!

And I get back inside from investigating and the Rangers scored smh
I was just trying to enjoy this caps game but I guess that's not happening anymore.
Excuse my French but this guy is a real JERK
S/O to whoever hit my car, basically totaled it and didn't leave a note or anything
If anyone knows a very simple way to tie a bow tie, please let me know.
Not sure why Rangers fans are chanting "Ovi sucks" when he's in the running for MVP and has the game's only goal.
@QAPhantom Eagles. That's all they need to be a super bowl caliber team
@QAPhantom they're gonna draft a kicker
I listen to George Ezra so yeah, I'm kind of a hipster <SURFER>üèº
@koch_99 you're supposed to retweet it not just favorite it guy
Big home game tomorrow vs Riverbend tomorrow night at 7! First conference game of the season! Come out and support!!!

This game is turning so CONCACAF right now. They're getting into scuffles every foul <CAT FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@samisosaaa idk if you could afford it because of all the shifts I've been taking for you
Piatti and Romero just told the whole Club America back line to hang up their boots.
Nobody cares about your stupid chicks, STOP SNAPCHATTING YOUR STUPID CHICKS
All Filipinos love boxing because they finally have someone good at a sport.
@McMurrerRyan 
@Lewis_TripleLIV happy birthday you beautiful person
Can't believe I took a shift at work when I have no homework. I could be doing big work in FIFA smh
@nikJ_ DC United <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
@NSWIZZZZ thanks Nicole!
@brittbratty2you I hope we play though cause we've had so many cancelled games
@brittbratty2you yeppers it's supposed to rain Thursday and Friday but hopefully it holds off. Our field is nice though so it might absorb.
@brittbratty2you if we play, it might get cancelled...
@brittbratty2you well they aren't a pain there but I guess close enough..
That'd be so sweet to get to your seats at the caps game and realize you get to sit next to John Wall and the Wizards.
Excited to have finally made my decision to attend the United States Coast Guard Academy!!
I can't put emojis in my Twitter name smh

@annagrauel thanks pal
So happy I finally made my college decision <CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE>
@jnastyyyyyyyyyy if only Sam still went to FP, we could use that projector
Although nobody really cares about DC United.
DC sports are on one right now. Wizards sweep the Raptors, Caps beat the Islanders, and DC United is second place in the conference.
On to the next one!
Kuznetzov <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
And that's on both sides too.
I hate when terrible arguments get retweeted onto my timeline. I don't have the energy to do anything but geez.
If the caps don't win this game, I'm gonna be so pissed. Beagle should have scored and Holtby really should have saved their goal.
@jnastyyyyyyyyyy 90$ for sd and 100$ for hd. I was hoping for $9.99 or something nice like that.
Come on Holtby...
@jnastyyyyyyyyyy I don't know if I care enough to make that sacrifice
@jnastyyyyyyyyyy the steakhouse isn't carrying it which is disappointing and yeah bdubs is gonna be MAD crowded
@introvertedHue interesting. I hope we  won't have to find out <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I need to find a restaurant that's showing the fight this Saturday!
JOEL WARD!!!!!!!
@introvertedHue really? Why do you think that?
@introvertedHue I'm not sure about that. It would have to take place in DC or Richmond and I think it would need a catalyst.
@bubba_trump me too. It was a fun year and the school work was pretty easy for how much everyone sices it.
@madiiib yep!!!!!! You're almost there madi!
Junior year is the biggest sice of high school, it's really not that bad.
@QAPhantom I don't think I ever have...
I told my mom I would make my college decision by today but I still have no idea what to do <HATCHING CHICK>
Hockey is so awesome, you just get to skate around hitting people and stuff
@samisosaaa blessed.
@tiaatortilla I appreciate that, Tia.
Today sucked cause I was tired all day cause my coworker thought calling me at 7:30 am to take his shift was a good idea.
@TheSilentKNOAH but are you really a fan?
@WhyAlways_T thanks buddy <GREEN HEART>
When your prom date puts up yet another prom picture and it's still not of you!!! #ireallyscreweduponsomething #smh
@KristoferJaams okay see you at b dubs tonight
@KristoferJaams uhhhh okay. I thought it was a cool little factoid.
Former Arsenal player/manager, Terry Neil, watching the game at the same bar as me in DC. <WEARY CAT FACE>
@TaylorTwellman did you see him trying to point towards the bench right after he got hit? He couldn't, he was totally incoherent.
@GoGetMyCoffee he's has a sub par season for his standards but he's still a good goalkeeper. RE: 2014 World Cup
This game is just miserable.
When you don't impress your prom date enough to make her Instagram picture cut #smh #ungrateful
@SiobhanShib but none with me ard
@Ryan_TheBishop bro, great tweet!!!
@introvertedHue who did you guys play?
@introvertedHue what's wrong buddy?
I feel like Troy Polamalu with these suit shoulder pads.
DC traffic ughhhh lol #NOVAprobz
@HoTCPR Yes
I might skip prom and just play FIFA, my manager mode is going real well and I would love to win the league for a second time tonight.
@claireeeebear18 alien baby"
I love when the Caps win outright rather than keeping it close!
@claireeeebear18 just a suit, no tux
@QAPhantom we aren't actually going to the dance, we just go take pictures and go to dinner and call it prom
Just tried on my stuff for prom and everything fits which is a huge stress reliever <CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE>
This week has sucked.
I can't do much right of late.
@annagrauel THE NEXT MISTY-MAY TRAINOR
@DB_killindem boi that's why Google says you're a giant squid cause you got tentacles growing out of your head
@HoTCPR I know that (whose mans is this)
@introvertedHue when Wayne Enterprises requires a high school diploma to be CEO
Thanks Google. I got probably the worst "animal" (not a real animal) you could get. 
@likeitsmcwomg when you're super popular"
I was super stoked to watch this game but then I slept through the whole first half.
@TheSilentKNOAH name five players or you're a bandwagon
School just becomes a joke after ap exams.
@TheSilentKNOAH Justin Bieber, Backstreet Boys, Tupac, N'Sync, New Kids on the Block
Jon Bellion has such a cool sound
I think it says a lot about our school that the word "control" is a word of the week.
That win was soooooo crucial.
Backstrom!!!!
@taylor_melia hbd.
@bret_campbell @ESPNFC (sarcasm)
@ESPNFC he has been very good this season, I can see why this would be such a tough decision.
Caps are giving up way too many power plays.
Tom Wilson is a truck.
@T_D_Brewski should've gotten an A all four quarters!
Hazard&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Neymar
@Jooorrrdan people love to.
@Jooorrrdan I am. Until he does something worthy of being compared to Messi and Ronaldo, I will hate him.
Terrible defending from David Luiz, Neymar being overhyped lives on.
That goal was all Iniesta
@dashawndunaway is that where you're going?
@dashawndunaway congrats man!
This school's AC must be broken cause it is so hot.
@Michael_brooks6 me neither bud <CRYING CAT FACE>
@khigginsss does it LITERALLY?!
People stress way too easily
I have never tasted a burger better than Five Guys.
That goal was so wack.
Okay never mind, 15 seconds in and it's over.
Overtime games in the playoffs are so intense
@A_B_Roc but we are going to cook bruh
@A_B_Roc see you tomorrow <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@_SpencerLobik quit favoriting my tweets guy
Just remembered I have to wake up at 5:30 for work tomorrow morning <CRYING CAT FACE> #golfboyz
@HoTCPR <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C> rock on brother
I wish MLS got more TV coverage. I would love to watch Seattle right now.
@QAPhantom hardly. I could do what he does with the squad he has. To
@QAPhantom I've seen plenty of comparisons.
No matter what, Mourinho is now where close to SAF's league. SAF was much more tactically adept and Mourinho relies on schoolboy tactics.
That goal was so stupid to give up, it just gave Chelsea even more incentive to sit back.
Drogba flails around like he's 100 pounds.
Down a goal, need to win to even have a chance at the title, and Tyler Blackett is the solution.
Falcao <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>üèº
Luke Shaw and Paddy McNair have been the most dangerous players for Manchester United.
There's just no creativity.
Oy vey Herrera
Terry goes through the back of Falcao to win the ball back before the goal <CONFUSED FACE>
Valencia has Hazard on straps
Positive start so far. Hope they can keep this going. #GGMU
Now that battlefield lost it will take away some of the satisfaction of when we beat them <CONFUSED FACE>
Too siced for this game tomorrow <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
This game is insane!
Yes Caps<GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Finally, let's go!
Come on caps <NEUTRAL FACE>

@HoTCPR truuuuuuu <CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE><POUTING CAT FACE>
@HoTCPR what was that tweet?
@HoTCPR screenshot or it didn't happen
@HoTCPR that's who it was? <WEARY CAT FACE>
I should have stayed home and watched House of Cards. The steakhouse is wack.
House of Cards is so confusing sometimes.
Jordan Morris is good because he wears all black cleats. He's not worried about the flash. #Class
DOS A CERO AGAIN
That ball from Perry Kitchen <WEARY FACE>
Dos a cero <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
JUAN AGUDELO!!!!!!!!!!
Yedlin has done well in his individual defensive battles tonight which is great to see.
I would take Perry Kitchen as a replacement for Kyle Beckerman in 2018.
This guy is learning quantum physics by day and scoring on Mexico by night.
@GHorgdal okay I'm sorry.
I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID. JORDAN MORRIS!!!!!!!!!
@GHorgdal to do well again in MLS and get called up once again to USMNT. I understand the bias.
@GHorgdal I feel you haha. I hope the best for him obviously. CJ Sapong (Philly Union) was my neighbor growing up so I would love for him
@GHorgdal He's only a college sophomore so he still has plenty of time to develop and I feel like someone else could've had the opportunity.
@GHorgdal I know but still, he's had a few chances now and hasn't done enough for me. He obviously has potential.
I'm still not sure what Jordan Morris has done to prove his spot on the roster other than run.
I wish Kyle Beckerman was younger so he could play in 2018 for us.
I would do some sick, sick things to have Deandre Yedlin's speed.
Jordan Morris, the first team all-PAC player, with the start!!!
USA USA USA
Don't advertise that the game starts at 8:30 if that's just coverage.
We're letting this scrub Yarborough on the bench but not Hamid.
@blackkkest @Mensah_98 that was Jordan Edwards, I knew not to trust him with my phone. Way to go Mensah, proud of you bud.
@Mensah_98 @blackkkest is she crazy
Mascherano is so solid in the back.
@PPR_8 his"
Neymar gets another easy goal to fuel is overratedness.
Quaresma scored two already??? Ronaldo 2.0!!!!
People who clap when they laugh are the most obnoxious people, you're just trying to shove your laughter in everyone's faces.
I hate when people ask me to retweet their tweets, I'll retweet it if it's a good tweet.
@itsrose1001 word
@itsrose1001 what's your homeroom
@itsrose1001 do you want me to bring mine?
We played some beautiful football tonight.
With 10 attempted shots  
The worst part of rain is the wet dog smell that accompanies it.
Why is Isco not playing?
It would be sweet if people would walk on the right side of the stairwell.
@claireeeebear18 @brittbratty2you I might be off to college by the end of June so you better make them quick!
@QAPhantom @HoTCPR <CRYING CAT FACE>
My room is at such a great temperature and I'm very content with my life right now. Good night friends.
@brittbratty2you when? I work almost every Saturday so no games for me <KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
I really gotta start eating healthier again. There's too much good junk out there.
@claireeeebear18 yeah well Brat certainly isn't going to the gym so she should have plenty of time or homework
I could be in my last two months of ever taking a math class, that's crazy to think about.
GOT EEM!!
This online calculus quiz is interrupting my sleep. These jonts are ridiculous.
@DB_killindem good luck man!
@_allhail_ <KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
Well if Justin Anderson isn't going to UVA next year then neither am I.
@AustynDingus yeah me too <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@_SpencerLobik hahaha arsenal and Manchester United might have something to say about that my friend
Almost got pelted in the head by a golf ball today so that was jah chill. But it's all for the love of the paper <MONEY WITH WINGS><MONEY BAG><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
@AustynDingus their shot and it came over my head and hit the part of the cart I was fixing.
@AustynDingus I was at work (golf course) and I was at the driving range, got out to fix the cart, off toward the side, and someone sliced
@AustynDingus I came about 2 inches away from losing my life. (Or at least getting a concussion)
And maybe forge cause apparently they're still undefeated.
I just wanna fast forward through the season and play Battlefield, Riverbend and Hylton already.
I'm sorry for my snapchat story. It's pretty unnecessary.
My hands are so dry that they could probably be classified as low grade sand paper.
Less than 12 hours after I left, I'm back at work.
Please nobody text me about the Manchester United game because I'll be at work and I won't be able to watch. Thank you so much all. <KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES><GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
That DC game was super disappointing. <CONFUSED FACE> Go up 2-0 and mental lapses lets them tie it at 2-2.
@lioness_hair what's your intended major?
GMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMG
This is perfect weather for soccer. How did our game get canceled?
So unreal.

@clutzy_cole unfortunately
Odd days are the absolute worst.
@sophie_wortmaan what's the score now?
@likeitsmcwomg well there's a champions league game on tonight at 10 on fox sports 2. Should be a great game. Herediano vs. Club America.
@likeitsmcwomg well I feel like an idiot. I thought you were talking about soccer.
@likeitsmcwomg champions league? Who is playing?
@likeitsmcwomg which one? UEFA or CONCACAF?
@madiiib you're so racist
@T_D_Brewski if chris played 20 minutes of pickup, both of his shoulders would have dislocated twice...
@_allhail_ but I think I can assume <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@_allhail_ (I couldn't see the second emoji) but orange and blue are coast guard colors too so I have no idea what you're saying
UVA was so awesome today, I have no idea how I'm going to make this college decision <WEARY CAT FACE><WEARY CAT FACE><WEARY CAT FACE>
The Costa Rican fans tonight were awful as well
Some awful refereeing but Montreal pulls it off!
@HoTCPR try it guy
JACK MACCCCCCC!!!!!!!!!
How does Alajulense not get a red card there?
And now Montreal is gonna take this heavy dub against Alajulense! #AllezMontreal
@rachel_wolak have fun with that quest <KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@vickkyjayy don't you dare insult my honor.
@vickkyjayy she is not adorable. She is super rude to me.
Back to UVA tomorrow means I'm missing an odd day <CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE><WEARY CAT FACE><SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><KISSING CAT FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
Siced about the 6-2 win and the clinic we put on in the second half #takenotes
#IMFC  #marquonslhistoire 

@likeitsmcwomg very responsible, much matureness
@DB_killindem regular season: uva tournament: notre dame
@DB_killindem they lost to Miami by 26 at home.
Duke shouldn't have even been a number one seed. They didn't win the acc regular season or acc tournament and they lost to scrub teams.
They couldn't even win the acc regular season though.
Duke fans are the absolute worst. <CRYING CAT FACE>
That easily hit his middle finger on the way out though?
Duke is getting some very favorable calls here.
@DB_killindem good luck!
This mans just missed a layup.
Notre Dame vs. UConn tomorrow will be hypeeee!!!!!!!!

@koch_99 you need her you sophomore. Say no @taylorcross98. He can't get in without you.
@mattchme <WEARY CAT FACE> check Charlie Adam's or Jermaine Defoe's goals. They should be 1 and 2.
@QAPhantom thanks Quanathan Dos Santos!
@ESPNFC never in a million years. He is the most overrated player.
Tomorrow starts Sportscenter's top plays being dominated by average baseball catches!
@Eric_Kumah11 line up outside and catch the fade route?
Over 40 days later and Neymar is still overrated.
Two cool things that happened during my social media absence: I turned 18 and got into UVA.
@_X_marksthespot thanks xavia!
@BrookRahe love you too <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@BrookRahe thanks sister!!!!!
I'm back on social media to bless your timelines. #yourewelcome
I'm outchea. Good night, and God bless.
Okay those were my 4 dogs






I'm going to post some cool pictures of my dogs to leave everybody with good memories.
No that's too exhausting.
Maybe I should tweet for things in advance...
9 minutes to bingo
Okay I'm back.
Okay I'm starting early, good bye.
Dear Twitter,
In my absence please fix these things.
With love,
Patrick
I won't miss, "this is so me" or girls retweeting/sicing their friends pictures, or ignorant/try hard "Twitter activists."
I'm sure my tweets about random soccer games that you could all care less about will be missed.
My last 20 minutes of social media before a 40 day break is upon us.
2 day week this week, 3 day week next week. #skippingschool
Crosby almost had an open goal if it wasn't for Beagle right there, hustle plays that go unnoticed but win games.
Backstrom is unreal
@BColcombe26 @claireeeebear18 fine I'll delete it
@juliaaaa_ann me too. There's so much good, unhealthy food out there <WEARY FACE>
@dashawndunaway yeah it's both
@claireeeebear18 @BColcombe26 I'll delete vine but might keep snapchat
@claireeeebear18 @BColcombe26 ughhhhh
@dashawndunaway it starts tomorrow (Ash Wednesday) and ends on Easter
@juliaaaa_ann that's tough <WEARY CAT FACE> I'm still trying to eat healthy though in addition to social media
Ovechkin is the man.
@likeitsmcwomg well then you're just a jerk for that
@dashawndunaway haha what do you mean?
This game is heating up <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
@BColcombe26 I don't care that much.
@likeitsmcwomg I'm glad to know where I stand with you.
@juliaaaa_ann ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! (Sorry I'm freaking out that The Julia Wortman tweeted at me) yes indeed. What are you giving up?
@BColcombe26 snapchat? <WEARY FACE>
@likeitsmcwomg and I guess I don't fit in that limited time smh
@likeitsmcwomg 703-489-7481 don't you forget it
@BColcombe26 but what if people unfollow me cause I'm not tweeting <PERSEVERING FACE>
@likeitsmcwomg I'll text you instead, like you did when you were up here this weekend! Oh wait.........
@BColcombe26 I'm deleting mine so I won't have any to open <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
At 11:59 PM I'm deleting Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and maybe Snapchat and Vine.
Are snapchat and vine considered social media?
@D_Morrissey25 he's such a pussy. Holtby didn't even budge
@D_Morrissey25 did you see him shove holtby in the back after that little scrum?
‚Äú@BColcombe26: Have to say goodbye to social media tonight until Easter. Such a bittersweet day‚Äù dude me too
Chelsea fans are such twats.

First caps game I'll be able to watch in its entirety for a looooooong time
#LRT I'm weak <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I hope Howison is cleared off by tomorrow.
@TheSilentKNOAH I rarely tweet, I just like to twatch :).
I'm torn between eating healthy or giving up social media.
I don't know what to give up for lent and it's tomorrow.
The bus will always come out with chelsea. Always.
Matic is such a good player. So calm and collected on the ball.
@HoTCPR @T_D_Brewski can you scoop?

Texting and driving is so selfish.
@Starbucks @HoTCPR
@UVa_Events @HoTCPR
@_jkBest I bled my heart out on the field today. I think my one goal and assist primarily as a defender says something for me...
Can't believe we lost :-(
@HoTCPR thx
@_jkBest you're commitment (or lack thereof) is appalling
@claireeeebear18 okay history is the coolest subject
Plumlee's face is so tall
It's weird that all those great players have identical twins that are all State Farm agents
@Michael_brooks6 easy W on April 9th
It's too cold for lax right now. To the car I go.
Received an offer of appointment to the United States Coast Guard Academy!
Last period of the day on a Friday and we have a sub. God is with us today.
@HoTCPR not a joke
Next time I see my brother I'm dropping him cold #disrespectful
@ATT @HoTCPR
Finally beat level 108!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't stay up for two more periods <SLEEPING FACE>
Why must this Caps game be so late?
Mike Tobey turning clutch???
Fifa 15 is whack
Falcao and RVP were both miserable against West Ham and start today. Why?
@C_Vidoli I'll do both
Chipotle line taking a BRICK
Finally got Chris Kyle's autobiography from the library to read #knowledge #education
Hahahahahaha Balotelli finally scored
Yedlin isn't even in the 18, he can't come on.

¬°Ol√©! 
This mans has at least one howler a game.
Danny Rose stop please.
How is that a good finish?

Now my field trip is canceled :(
This is the one day I don't want a delay because I'm really trying to go on this field trip tomorrow.
So obnoxious
Have they announced any big awards yet?
@vanskiverr did you have her?
I actually really liked her though so it's jah chill.
@vanskiverr ms. Hopkins she taught civics
One of my eighth grade teachers is now my next door neighbor. Weird.
@BrookRahe how so?
@BrookRahe is that your school name? Cause if so that's a joke.
I'm so happy Ghana lost, pretty much any other team could win it as long as it's not Ghana and I'll be happy.
COTE D'IVOIRE
@JimmyConrad Bein sports
Can't believe I'm missing this AFCON shootout :-/
This PK shootout is outrageous.
Please win Ivory Coast. I can't stand Ghana.

@HoTCPR good thing I have a birthday coming up <SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@HoTCPR just saw them they are so fresh
@AmberLynnHodges she only gets hype cause she's fast and somewhat attractive. I think Leroux is a better version than her.
@AmberLynnHodges thank you so much
I could coach our women's team, I tweeted about Ali and now she's coming on. #wizkid
Smh Ali wouldn't have gotten beat that bad
@HoTCPR thanks.
That was bad.
@HoTCPR two&gt;one
DALEY BLIND IS MY BOYYY
And Costa kind of ruins my hypothesis but he is an outlier.
@PPR_8 "successful La Liga players
Di Maria and Falcao make me wonder how many La Liga players would actually have success in the Premier League.
@BColcombe26 so you're telling me when I see other people doing that on TV, that they are actually d1 athletes?
@HoTCPR not entirely sure what half of the players out there are doing
Falcao tried to pull a Macheda.
Di Maria has been pretty absent today as well.
How much does falcao get paid to do that?
@HoTCPR you're so biased towards your hoos
Set piece defending has been atrocious today.
@HoTCPR BAHAHAHAHA no.
That was dirty from Alex Morgan but she is so overrated.
Megan Rapinoe is the best player our women's national team has
Ashlyn Harris is way hotter than Hope Solo
I cannot see Falcao getting a permanent deal.
Touchbase tomorrow, GEMS field trip on Tuesday, good start to the week <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Geoff Cameron with the assist! #yanks
I have to watch 6 Walking Dead episodes by tomorrow night in order to be caught up in time. Can I do it?
Hogwarts looks magical.
@rachel_wolak @_MelloYellow yes you will get kidnapped in Lake Terrapin..
How is Gonzaga number two team in the nation when they play scrub teams the whole season?
This Sons of Liberty show is banging
@karleenuh if they knew your personality then they wouldn't
@BColcombe26 no I'm good. Still have about three months. Thanks for the concern though!

@QAPhantom oh I thought you meant very bad

@QAPhantom I don't think the winner of the division falls into that category but okay
#LRT smh no respect for New England Revolution

Michael and Sons is throwing shade.
@vickkyjayy and the one after was in support of my brother.
@vickkyjayy why? If you stand for a cause, explain why it's so important. Stand for your beliefs.
@vickkyjayy the original tweet or the one after?
@vickkyjayy but of course you just a objectify him by his looks instead of judging him by who he actually is
@vickkyjayy his personality is <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
‚Äú@vickkyjayy: that always commercial was so important‚Äù when you're trying to be a feminist but don't know what to say.
My first half stats:
5 buffalo wings
4 Oreo brownies
2 plates of carrots
3 8 oz water bottles 
2 pieces of Stromboli
Boston accents are the absolute worst and that's another reason to root for the Seahawks.

@_jkBest are you going to the game tonight?
Seahawks: 34 
Patriots: 24
I hate both team's fans but I really hate the Patriots as a team. Therefore my applause will be saved only for the Seahawks.
@2KLeeT yessir. You better catch a game when you're home

That dude was rocking Ovechkin and the refs were holding him so he couldn't swing back.
4-0!!!
@WhyAlways_T ..........
Yessssss Ovechkin!!!!!!
Maybe the caps can cheer me up with a dub.
@HoTCPR what? It's true.
Yedlin shows how ill prepared he is for life in the Premier League.
Well watching that game was pretty upsetting.
@juliaaaa_ann @Mattjawnsuhn @sophie_wortmaan do not take fag. It's really hard. Functions trig is doable.
@claireeeebear18 it was very jerky
In other good news I think my car is broken.
A full day of school, on an odd day. Things couldn't be worse.
@tiaatortilla wat?
@tiaatortilla but what did I do to deserve this shout out?

Idk why kids think teachers are compelled to raise an 89 to a 90 or 79 to 80, they're not. Do better.
@annagrauel oh wow
@annagrauel did you have to do an interview for that?
How Diego Costa doesn't get a red card every game I'm not sure.
This Zouma guy is some trash.
Just saw a post about Schevchenko. Throw back to the time I met him and didn't even know <CONFUSED FACE>
Just square the ball to Gerrard....
Diego Costa is such a punk.
Jose Mourinho is so overrated.
ALL PWCS EVENING ACTIVITIES CANCELLED BOYYY

@khigginsss are you bringing me breakfast in bed orrrrrr.....? (Cause school won't be in at 7:30)
(But no one gets hurt and we get a two hour delay)
Praying these roads are icy.
This anticipation is killing me <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

How did the Seahawks even come back?
Love seeing City lose..
It's a Sunday blessing to be able to watch Cazorla and Sanchez.
Giroud!!!!!!!
@HoTCPR yeah I was confused by that as well. He had so much space. Then be took a half second too fast to play it to Ramsey.
Kompany should have a red card. Completely clattered into Sanchez.
Sanchez just murdered Zaba's ankles
Ox cut up Kompany. <FLUSHED FACE>
@HoTCPR took you long enough to tweet it
@morgan_drank you're back?
What a pass..
Come on caps geez
Toronto signing Giovinco might be the most impressive signing in league history.
See if this place lives up to the hype
First time getting Cookout,,
Just watched a jump rope performance at the halftime of a basketball game and it was the greatest thing ever.
Fellaini the hero
@AdeWorldPeace back 3"
@AdeWorldPeace yeah Ben Antwi would run all over the back 4
Why is Di Maria playing up top?
@AdeWorldPeace who's on your squad?
No but they play sunderland, I hope they smash sunderland.
I hope Tottenham loses again. Put Yedlin in the 18.
Watch American Sniper and see what our soldiers and their families go through home and abroad to really gain a sense of appreciation.
@Michael_brooks6 fam I think you're supposed to g to jail now..

@HoTCPR no traffic is too bad.

@madiiib yes and yes
@T_D_Brewski Ikr...it bothers ne
@madiiib it's about you.
And when girls constantly tweet about it it just comes across as needy.
I don't get why people get so stressed out and worried about high school relationships. It really doesn't even matter.
Emerson Hyndman and Tommy Thompson are the truth.

I feel like we will at least have a two hour delay so they can see what this storm whips up. Maybe a cancellation of it's bad enough.
@DB_killindem congrats fam!
@CGJoe85 @HoTCPR it ruined it.
@Milestoocold @NiceeLikeNigel yeah I'm saying logics more boring than j cole
@NiceeLikeNigel @Milestoocold miles you say j cole puts you to sleep though...?
@HoTCPR idk he follows like 27 thousand people so it's not that impressive. I still want him to unfollow me.

For the second successive year, @Cristiano Ronaldo has won the FIFA Ballon d‚ÄôOr. 

They make me play with Tyler Blackett and Phil Jones 
Why did Brad Davis follow me? I still directly blame him for Landon Donovan's World Cup absence.
If your team gets trashed 7-1 in the World Cup. You, as a defender, should be nowhere near the team of the year.
If Ronaldo doesn't win the ballon d'or then I'm boycotting FIFA

@Tgrant2013 good for you kid
@dashawndunaway Fairfax boyyy!
@madiiib for Fairfax!!!
2 hour delay lets gooooooooooo!!!
@Tgrant2013 no I just don't believe that there are any MK Dons supporters in America
Watching our U-20s is almost painful at times.
Kellyn Acosta has to be neater going forward.
Finland has the number one education system in the world. Think they have snow days? #openPWCS
Refs ruin the game. Some bs.
Even when they go to the booth they manage to screw up the call.
Football is stupid.
He has possession and then his knee touches down? I don't understand how he isn't down.
How was he not down???
Dez Bryant is a beast.
That national anthem was shaky at best...
@Tgrant2013 perfect advice. Who's your team?
Bring Wilfried Zaha back
Love bringing Blackett off the bench to contribute nothing.
@Tgrant2013 they still had way better chances? Mata had two perfect chances and missed them both.
@ESPNFC deserved? Hardly...
Almost no attacking creativity whatsoever.
This defense is honestly a joke.
Valencia can't put a ball in to save his life.
I still don't understand how Blackett didn't get there on their goal.
Mata...
Alexis Sanchez is miles better than Neymar.
Cam as in Chancellor. Not that Newton guy.
Yes we Cam!!!
Deandre Yedlin smiles with glee watching Kyle Walker get torn up on that goal.
Wilfried Zaha... <FLUSHED FACE>
@AdeWorldPeace nah it's not that bad out there.

Perez and Cabella are eating this chelsea defense up.
Diego Costa looks like Oscar's drunk father
That Guatemala U-20 goal <FLUSHED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
This Tommy Thompson kid can ball.
@jbs319 he's injured. He was a late scratch
@udontknowellis I've never been to a basketball game before haha I'm used to everything starting at 7
@udontknowellis it's at 730 not 7?
@madiiib oh that sucks
@madiiib where's the meet
@_allhail_ thank you so much Hailey! <CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
Realizing I could find out about a college next week is daunting.
@khigginsss @Shaun_Mckenna04 well we are getting them in class so this is awkward..
@khigginsss @Shaun_Mckenna04 he's giving us the answers tomorrow so......
People are so ungrateful it pisses me off.
We keep getting two hour delays because the busses can't start of it's too cold...
@dashawndunaway haha I'm deleting it cause I feel bad
We always do what Fairfax does and now they're hopping off that train?
@jas_mine12 I love that show!
@BenGHensel we missed you in class buddy <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
I had a dream that Di Maria got injured again. #badomen
@introvertedHue what happened?
"And he's off like a prom dress!" - Ray Hudson on Griezmann
I want Torres to score the game winner against Real Madrid in the 90th minute.
@C_Vidoli @vickkyjayy  @ Catherine
@C_Vidoli @vickkyjayy quit tweeting in class
I hate the red bulls so much. Even more after firing Mike Petke.
@laurenedwardss_ please come <PENSIVE FACE>
@laurenedwardss_ are you going to school tomorrow???
@WhyAlways_T piss off
@WhyAlways_T impossible"
@WhyAlways_T I doubt it but 9 points certainly isn't possible
@WhyAlways_T <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@WhyAlways_T yeah I know Manchester United has done it twenty times
I want these snow days to start after the second quarter is over. I got a few grades to raise before it ends.
@WhyAlways_T being in first at the beginning of the new year doesn't earn you a trophy <FLUSHED FACE>
@WhyAlways_T again choose your words careful my friend...
@WhyAlways_T real is one of the last words I would use to define chelsea
@WhyAlways_T ...okay...
Hahahah messi is not going to chelsea
@_jkBest have fun at work! Sucker!
@khigginsss "just do it"-Nike
@khigginsss you're not even in school.....!?!!!????!!
I could've watched so much Walking Dead today :-/
My first period teacher isn't here yet soooooo.......
PWCS is so stingy.
We should've at least had a delay.
@likeitsmcwomg ok you probably deserve it
Waking up early is depressing.
@laurenedwardss_ (no it was like in the commercials when you say someone's name and then they look up and share a moment, ja feel?)
@laurenedwardss_ ...aera?
@QAPhantom Cowboys get to enjoy the playoffs and the good feeling of not needing the refs.
At least tomorrow is an even day #blessed
What a game!
@QAPhantom where did most of the Eagles go on vacation? Just wondering...
YESSSSSSSSSSS
Demarco Lawrence. Just fall.
#despicable
Fam I hit a 40 yard field goal after cross country practice in my bare feet and you miss a 41 yard field goal as a professional?
How do you miss that tackle on a QB?
Can't afford those type of mental mistakes #smh
Let's go cowboys!!!
@khigginsss @samisosaaa yaaaay! Can't wait to hang out!!!! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Up 2-0, put Gedion in.
@B_Engly don't get your hopes up fam.
@T_D_Brewski wow, astute analysis TV guy!!!
@udontknowellis @DB_killindem sheetz is the most underrated gas station in the game. That place is amazing.
Can't believe UVA pulled that one out!

Steven Gerrard is probably going to end up at LA Galaxy. #mlsposterboys
Refs tried handing the Blackhawks the game.
@Hicksmat @guardian_sport pretty much every American is pissed about it. Really pissed.
For all the tough times Man Utd has had lately, this warms my little heart.
@_HEC__ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
This Courtois guy sucks.
Hazard would not score if Yedlin was playing...
It would be awesome if Man Utd could win and thus make up big points when chelsea drops them.
Danny Rose scored?????!!!!! #worstleftbackintheleague
We want Jozy!!!!
Such a lack of creativity in the attacking 3rd.
Happy birthday to the realist @_allhail_
Another away game, another non-win.
Such a waste of time...
That was such a fifa play. You get on the break and your player pulls up with an injury.
My room is the tundra.
@HoTCPR no one cares. Go to bed son

@introvertedHue you should do the tweet or not tweet one fam
@madiiib <DISAPPOINTED FACE>that's my favorite place
@madiiib where is it
@adrianabreziana @bpaultorres @Elmaestro2TM yeah he grew up in Maryland. One of the main reasons he chose us is because he felt american...

I could never imagine losing my dog <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Good win for the Wizards on the start of the road trip.
'Zards bench screwing up this game.
@itsrose1001 okay not as bad as the time I went there and they ran out of tortillas....
@annagrauel don't rush it! I'm sure it will be awesome!
@HoTCPR idk how you can say that witcha abominable hairline
@T_D_Brewski yeah, imagine that feeling of accomplishment
@TannerWild_ how do you not like him
Hiking the seven summits would be the sweetest thing ever.
@BColcombe26 just random people are fans,  and when your franchise player is a rapist, it's hard to like them, ya feel?
@CGJoe85 I deleted it cause I felt bad

Too many steelers fans for this area.

@claireeeebear18 I will go downstairs and play Xbox if you guys annoy me.
I hate when people talk when I'm trying to listen to the TV.
Manchester United could have made up points today with Chelsea and City tying. #smh
What a service from Adam Johnson...sunderland quality
Love seeing Chelsea drop points <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Someone tell me when Jozy gets on..
RVP and Falcao were bad.
I don't understand how you drop points there.
This second half sucks.
Getting real nervous about this game. Anything less than a win would be disappointing. Finishing has been miserable.
He's weak.
One good save, Lloris is still overrated.
@claireeeebear18 not funny
@annagrauel it was the celtics!!!
@HoTCPR @T_D_Brewski @_SpencerLobik @_jkBest I am doing real good on tips today <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è must be my infectious charm!

@yellowcardSCB apologies, it's the Yank in me I guess
I hope Altidore gets traded in January, can't stand these Sunderland muppets.
This is just beautiful football.
Anybody trying to go to Howison after these games?
Chris sucks.
@HoTCPR boi bye
@XboxSupport I can't sign in and it's screwing me over. I'm out here trying to save the world in Assassins Creed. What do I do?
@JulesAGawd yes! son I built a pendulum in 5th grade
If I can't sign in on Xbox, is this cause of the hackers?
@juddparkercar the one time we played I cooked you <SLEEPING FACE>

Most stressed out I've been in a while.

Love coming home to possibly the most disgusting dog like ever.
@2KLeeT lemme know and I might come too
@2KLeeT are you coming to practice?
@Milestoocold win the league
@Milestoocold haha you guys will get cooked. Messi and Suarez are gonna run rampant
I don't really follow basketball but if you have four more seasons than someone, I don't find it impressive that you passed them in scoring.
@rachel_wolak @vickkyjayy you're not going anymore...did you see what's happening in Sydney? I couldn't live if my rachy got hurt.
Dez Bryantttt

And hotels are gross,
I don't mind waking up early to drive to North Carolina tomorrow because it just means one extra night in my bed.
Mr. Nance cut his hair off...<FLUSHED FACE>
@vickkyjayy before you make your cookoes

GoogleDocs has changed the game of group projects.
@AKHLD_ oh right right right I just looked at my notes my bad
That wizards game was wild
@AKHLD_ and did you do any analysis?
@AKHLD_ can you put your summary on the Google doc?
@AKHLD_ alright shweg!
@AKHLD_  I found the movie online so I'll check our times. We have the easiest scene cause it's so short. We will stop it in  a few places.
90's music was probably the best thing, besides me, coming from that decade.
@AKHLD_ did you get the Google doc
Checked 95 to make sure I could use it to get to practice, didn't know 234 would be my downfall.
Traffic is sitting on 234.
I'm staying off Twitter for the rest of this game cause I'm about to start kirkin.
Ashley Young had a good game last week but now his right back to his old ways of sucking.
@HoTCPR wait until HT...
Another first half substitution....
Paddy McNair is having a dreadful game.
All started from a terrible square ball by Fellaini.
Imagine an in form RVP and Falcao...
RVP!!!!
@HoTCPR just being nice...? <RAISED HAND>
Except Chris, can't stand that kid, hope he fails.
Good luck to all the college kids on their finals!!!
@HoTCPR I said this to dad too when I found out you weren't coming home until Friday!!!
Can't wait for CASL next weekend!
Dogs are the best animals in the world. Man's best friend for sure.
Took LA long enough to get the most titles in league history with all the money/players they have.
@HoTCPR debatable
Not much I hate more than Taylor Twellman's voice.
He just sang the anthem wrong...
Just saw a comment that said he couldn't make the Women's national team................................
Landon Donovan's last game so now all the stupid arguments that "he's not the best US player of all time, Mia Hamm of Abby Wambach is." <NEUTRAL FACE><WEARY FACE><RAISED HAND>
@annagrauel PUERTO RICO
@DB_killindem suuuupppeeerrrr bright
The future is bright!
And Klinsmann needs to get Gedion Zelalem to play for us.
Bill Hamid needs to go to Europe. As much as DC would miss him, he has to continue to improve as the future goalkeeper of the national team.
Jozy needs to leave Sunderland. It's a toxic situation, whether he stays in England or not, he needs a new club, a fresh start.
And now I can't stop thinking about our national team and the 2018 World Cup!
Just went back and looked at all of my tweets the day of the US-Belgium game. <CRYING FACE>
@HoTCPR I cook all of you. 
#shhh
FIFA 15 frustrates me no end.
That was the saddest movie ever...
Just now getting around to watching "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"
@itsrose1001 ...
Goldfish are the number one snack food in the game!
City wins off of a soft pk. Thank the ref.
@BColcombe26 probably not. Most of the newer ones are in the back and they didn't have enough wreaths for those.
Another possible red card...and a soft pk given... #conspiracy
Now our women's national team is in the group of death too! #conspiracy
That's the softest PK ever.
Lucky to not get a red there...
Mangala is so bad <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@BColcombe26 not on any stones that I laid wreaths on. When did he pass away?
This changes things... Bye bye aguero.
Come on you Toffees!
Laying wreaths at the Quantico Cemetery  was one of the coolest/most humbling things I have ever done! 
Come on Newcastle!!!

@jas_mine12 this is descriptive
@HoTCPR can I go too???
@BColcombe26 <FLUSHED FACE>
Same with The Imitation Game.
Selma looks like a very good movie.
@2KLeeT good luck dude! Try and be better than me! (That won't happen but still...)
I feel so on top of my game. (Game as in school cause I finished my research paper two days before it is due) #mvp

@vickkyjayy rt :'-)
@vickkyjayy I'm not so sure about that one partner.
@vickkyjayy if you ever wonder, "I wonder if patrick and I are friends?" The answer is no.
Aguero is too good.
I kinda like this Tim Howard Brad Friedel feud...
Again, Lloris is some trash...
@tony_mosqueira aguero"
Lloris is overrated
Sunderland is winning. And it's wickham...wow
Why does anybody think he's that good?
Lloris is some beans!!!!
Kane is tearing it up
Kane <WEARY FACE>
@tomsiff it's frustrating. I know jozy has pretty much done nothing but when he gets a 30 minute cameo and does well you expect some reward.
Can this NHS meeting hurry up? The city game starts in 25 minutes!!
You start Connor Wickham who literally got in the way of Altidore when he was in the box and had the chance to score. #smh
That pisses me off. Altidore has a good game against Chelsea and then doesn't get the start the next game. #discrimination
@T_D_Brewski #freshmenadvice amirite???
@juliaaaa_ann @vickkyjayy 
6 people at practice! #committed
Gee whilikers my blood started to pump.
De Gea is unreal.
David de gea!!!!!
I would leave on Wilson and take off RVP...
This is Ashley young's best game in a while.
I'm not even sure how that went in.
Young is tearing it up on that side.
This dude is so biased. Stoke has done nothing.
What is this announcer talking about? Stoke has done nothing this game. Their passing has been dreadful and not "confident" at all.
Mignolet is such trash.
@vickkyjayy still a little behind
@vickkyjayy you're behind
Fellaini!!!!!
Herrera....
Shouts out to this guy!!!!!! Parking in my spot and such!!!! #GetThisCarTowed2k14 
@HoTCPR this really wasn't worthy of 3 favs
@HoTCPR is that what i said?

This research paper is beyond frustrating
@itsrose1001 we don't...remember we were supposed to take the test but now that's thursday
The Red Bulls are going to suck next year.
Everyone is annoying today.
I hate the way stoppage time is handled. That keeper wasted at least a minute in goal kicks alone and the whistle is blown right at 94 min.
Robbie Rogers just played the most telegraphed pass in the history of the game and it could've cost Donovan his career.
@HoTCPR he'd put yedlin up top with martins #LB+Y
Yedlin is that guy to just kinda run into someone with the ball and still somehow end up with it.
Seattle looked like they had it in the bag and now an LA goal (mostly) against the run of play opens everything up.
This game is insane..............<FLUSHED FACE>
Wow Thierry Henry played on turf...what a warrior...(shut up Taylor twellman)
In a perfect world, the Galaxy lose tonight. Donovan retires. Then come March he comes out of retirement and signs for DC.
Obafemi Martins is my MVP for sure. That dude is a beast.
Seattle again!
@HoTCPR everybody just froze for no reason
@C_Vidoli you can do a lot with it <WINKING FACE>
@vickkyjayy this sounds like a justification of you hitting a person with your car...
@HaleySeefeldt but you saw me so how bad could it be???
@itsrose1001 (thank you in german)
@itsrose1001 danke

@_jkBest IM JUST AN IMPARTIAL FOOTBALL FAN
This florida QB is kinda some cut.
The red bulls are out!!!! Let's goooooooooo
Two defensive errors led to two NYRB goals. #stupid
If jozy doesn't get the start after this performance then poyet is discriminating against him.
JOZY ALTIDORE IS STEPPING ON THE PITCH #BEWARE #GOALSCORER #WORLDCLASS
@_SpencerLobik Jozy is coming on. <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><FLEXED BICEPS><POLICE CARS REVOLVING LIGHT><SMILING FACE WITH HORNS> #youvebeenwarned
Costa could've been sent off at this point. The yellow on brown and then his little scuffle with o'shea should've been a yellow.
This is a game for JOZY!!!!!!!
What a strike...
That's the goal he needs!!!!!
#BringBackCleverley
Can diego costa, fabregas, courtois, and a few other chelsea players catch this injury bug?
And now rooney. Are you kidding me?
Who needs Di maria when you have goal scorers like smalling?
Do they not stretch or something?
Are you kidding me?
Di maria <UNAMUSED FACE>
That was the worst goal ever. Foster should've just caught it..
@HoTCPR we all hate you
@khigginsss smh sitting next to him in class smh
I just wanna fast forward like 6 months so I know where I'm going.
Reaching that point of being really stressed and just sick of everything.
Biggest pet peeve is when people waste my time.
Hokies should definitely thank the refs there.
These refs are HEAVILY pro-tech.
This game is taking a brick and a half to finish.
@_jkBest YOU DONT EVEN GO TO TECH
These refs are terrible. That was a clear first down.
How was that not a pass interference...?
@rachel_wolak cheer up butter finger <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@rachel_wolak yeah that turkey was pretty good!!!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@HoTCPR sorry autocorrect
@_jkBest yeah I know but I see them on my TL
Tech kids are so annoying...
Go hoos
@tiaatortilla hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@khigginsss thank you muchly friend. Right back at you <BLUE HEART>
@marinbomarr wow clearly his head isn't in the game
If your friends don't want the absolute best for you and if they slander your success, then they aren't you're real friend.
@2KLeeT so then he is still going to be tried?
How is Ray Rice not in jail?
Falcao should be fit for this weekend. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@petkemike so it was the AR that he was enraged at?
UVA will beat tech today by the score line of 3-2.
@petkemike describe the exchange between you and Espindola in leg 2. #fireaway
I definitely need to go on a juice cleanse after today.
The players are so unintelligent it's frustrating. EA sports expects you to be able to control everybody, and you just can't.
Played two games of FIFA 15. I hate it,
@QAPhantom thanks for the tip tj
@QAPhantom I got the Xbox one instead.
Yup I'm done with this game now.
This Dallas game is extremely disappointing.
Tony Romo literally just fell right over. <NEUTRAL FACE>
@tiaatortilla but you gon cut that turkey?
@itsrose1001 violence is ALWAYS the answer ROSE
Off to get the Xbox one at target. I will trample someone for the ability to play FIFA tonight.
That's another pro of soccer. 90 minutes of action lasts about 105 minutes. 60 minutes of football lasts like 210 minutes.
So many commercials in football. <NEUTRAL FACE>
It's okay. The Giants scored 3 touchdowns on their first 3 drives last week. I'm not worried.
How is that not a pass interference?!
@L_Kizzzzle @sobefaith @wadduuupp @koch_99 what
@BrookRahe you won't tweet the response coe
#TheDogShow on nbc! Love this show!
I am thankful for God, everything He gives me, my family, my friends, and my country.
That tweet was a joke, I love you all.
@annagrauel ...
@_keelybee yeah but that's not what everyone is tuned into. It's kind of like streakers in sports, live broadcasts don't show it.
#stoptheparade is so pointless. Even if the protesters do interrupt it, (fat chance), they're not going to broadcast it.
@dashawndunaway how does the authors racism affect the book. Or would it be effective without racism? Something like that
@dashawndunaway it's called heart of darkness. The book itself is relatively boring but the topic is somewhat interesting
@dashawndunaway yeah it is nothing interesting at all haha. Well it's kind of interesting if you read the book but idk it might be cool idk
@dashawndunaway on some book.
I will write two pages for my research paper tomorrow morning. #goals
@tiaatortilla thanks t
@khigginsss does this mean you won't be in first anymore??? <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@khigginsss nothing to brag about. No graduation for you!!! <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE><GRADUATION CAP><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@khigginsss tru but who skipped first today?
@laurenedwardss_ @TheMattEspinosa I'm almost as famous as you matt. <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è I'm your biggest fan and I look up to you so much!!! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@eliserasmas hahahahah congrats. His confidence needs to be knocked down a few pegs anyways.

This calculus test on Tuesday is a super buzz kill.
@QAPhantom oh quan, you are mistaken my friend. It is I who will relish in your tears come thanksgiving.
The worst we can finish is 8-8!!!
I'm so happy right now.
@MariyanPeev yeah that was always the worst when there was a few that I couldn't find
Game over. Good night.
That's a mighty nice spot.
Punt it
This guy is ruthless.
@MariyanPeev you know yahoo answers has everything right?
Dez came for Odell's celebration twice now.

Odell Beckhar Jr. is such a flopper.
These refs are some foogazie
It can't snow Wednesday though cause we won't get off school and my brother needs to fly in.
That mans was MOVING.
WHITE BOY GOT WHEELS!!!!
One man team.
How can you call him a "world class soccer player" if he only played as a kid? Haha
This could be a long game <CONFUSED FACE>
This guy is too good. That catch was amazing.
How many third down conversions did they have on that drive?
Too bad it didn't work. Still cool though.
Dolphin's kicker hit a Rabona on the onside kick!!!!!!

Natural grass is infinitely times better than turf. Especially when it's old, rough,  unkept turf.
@moiramoocow I'm coming by soon to see henry.

Transfer Talk: 
I want to write a book when I retire.
I just want Tuesday to roll around so 67% of my siblings can come home and then Thursday to come about so the final 33% will be home!
I need to start taking games more serious and do better.
Geez di maria

@dashawndunaway did you read the rolling stone article?
Isn't this like the third college day this year? I don't know where I am going. If I did, life would be a lot less stressful.
Numerous horrible rape statistics are brought up and all you're worried about is the reputation of your school? People are stupid.

@AmberLynnHodges what if he says no??? That would be really awk.
@AmberLynnHodges at 6:30/do you think coach addy would let me hop in?
@AmberLynnHodges do you guys have practice tonight?

Although I have a bunch of laundry and I didn't do any of it but if that's the worst part about my day it was probably a good day.
Getting 8 hours of sleep on a school night is a blessing.
Today was great because we had no school so I slept in, did a bunch of college work that I hadn't had time to do, and now I'm going to bed.

@T_MUMM eh, fair enough. At least dc won't have to worry about him next year.
@T_MUMM hahaha I was kidding about that, there's not much to say in a loss. I just don't think henry did amazing today.
@T_MUMM okay and BWP is an overrated muppet who only scored that many goals because of Henry
@T_MUMM I was mad at that game but then "U mad bro?" got me more pissed...
@T_MUMM amazing? He did nothing except for his assist.
I'm heated right now.
@claireeeebear18 @2KLeeT aye step outta her mentions b
Some of the worst refereeing I've seen in a while. Favored the Red Bulls the whole game.
The first good thing Henry did all game
If the away goals rule plays a part in this match I'm gonna freak out.
@tony_mosqueira happy birthday buddy! Glad to see city did well for you!!
This DC game is hype.
This is sick 
My mans is ready for his call up to the starting XI 
It's weird to think that I could be seeing Thierry Henry play the last game of his career today when the red bulls lose to dc.
Can't wait for this DC United game later!
Of course chelsea gets away without giving up that pk. #cheats
And maybe baseball if they're still nice at that
That's the one sport hylton will beat us in all year...

Forge was really good though. I just hate their fans. It's cool to start chants but once you start walking on the court I hate you.
@annagrauel @BenGHensel I know you guys do. 16 is really good.
@BenGHensel yes
At least we beat them in soccer.
Forge kids are a bunch of tools doe
Can't believe we lost to forge in volleyball :(

RIP

@dashawndunaway you just made the best decision of your life...
Idk why the National Archives guards got mad at me for having my phone out when they let Nicolas Cage steal the Declaration of Independence.
Actually I chose to leave but I still hate him. #imnotthatmuchofalosertogetleft
I hate my field trip group.

Wtf how did I get a b in calculus? God bless my life.
@annagrauel what
I'm really scared my dad will get really pissed when he starts watching the Arsenal game. <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@HoTCPR I just thought it was necessary to put it out there because it was THAT good.
I don't watch champions league, if the best team in the world isn't in it, it's not worth it.
Just took the most amazing nap ever.
NEYMAR IS NO WHERE NEAR TOP 4 IN THE WORLD STFU
@introvertedHue alright thanks!
@introvertedHue shweet. Could I possibly bring a disc that you could burn the video to? <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@introvertedHue are you coming to practice tomorrow?
@annagrauel aw is that your newborn?
Does anyone have the election page packet and can send me it???
Paging the election tomorrow, hoping to be the sticker boy.
@2KLeeT ight I'm gonna break that thursday
@2KLeeT what was your 5k or again?
@BColcombe26 take a few deep breaths tough guy. I don't want your heart rate to be up so high before you sleep, it's bad for you.
@2KLeeT I better be on that list.
@BColcombe26 good night <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@BColcombe26 calm down dude!!!!!!!!! I was just kidding!!!!!!!!
This mans is SOOOOO riled up and bitter that his team is full of criminals.
@BColcombe26 people frequently badmouth them and I just let it go. I guess I'm just a more passive person.
#hungryforlearning
And I still have to finish this homework. #nosleeptilbrooklyn #letsgetit
2 day week for me. But tomorrow is going to suck.
@BColcombe26 really? Cause it kind of seems like you picked up the debate indirectly, I was just asking rhetorical questions.
@BColcombe26 but was I looking for a debate? Was I?
@BColcombe26 did I want a debate?
@BColcombe26 k..........
@BColcombe26 oh....so he's definitely innocent.......
I'm not even a Ravens fan, I just hate the Steelers.
@BColcombe26 they sound like terrible people
Isn't James Harrison the one who gets all the penalties and fines? And isn't Ben Rothlisberger a rapist?
I might as well watch the rest of this game and accept the fact that I'll be up late doing homework.

@Hey_RaeRae wowzers
Who is Alex from target?
I've been in such a soccer funk lately, just not playing well and being disinterested.
