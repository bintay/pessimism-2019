@superbunnyhop Any opinions on Yooka Laylee? I loved Rares 3D platformer/collectathons! Personally optimistic.
@superbunnyhop is this real life?

@MetalGearOnline infected in cod games for example was a private match mode, then they made it a game type in a bonus playlist
@MetalGearOnline one I don't think would not become a mode was called swat, mgo2 players camped building while enemies assaulted, was fun
@MetalGearOnline is it possible for made up private match games to become actual modes if they are popular enough?

@HyperBitHero So you see the new Feb PS+ free games line up?
@SEGA I appreciate Yakuza4 on PS+, but its a series I want to play in order, release HD collection with subtitles! I will buy series (not 4)
@superbunnyhop Got a Wii U, you should of just started it offline, games them selves have updates on them.
@PlayStation When are these taken off? I am going to renew plus soon
@MetalGearOnline Feedback would be easier to give with a BETA to play with, owners of GZ only perhaps? Maybe free for PS+ to spread hype.

@CHSommers This video might give you some insight on gamers love for video games, I feel its worth protecting 
@mundanematt 
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina They bring up "women in video games" to make it appear as though thats what people are angry about
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina  Women in video games? People who write about video games?
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina There has been so much hate. So many angry words, so many accusations, over...what? Video games?
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina When kotaku writes...
@jennytablina 
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina other indie devs heavily network, they will know who to avoid. Gaming journalists will ignore them as well
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina Have you seen people speak out against it? A small game dev will ruin his career if he does so
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina We can't control the more toxic people, but this is making a small difference.
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina I'm just gonna say this, it IS slowly working, something this unorganized is changing sites policies.
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina No one big wants to cover it directly because it affects them, it keeps the status quo in check
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina against it, and that is not right. Men get in trouble for much less, while women are ignored
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina we aren't though, we want free speech, but when feminism is infested in these sites you get banned for speaking
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina Mundane Matt also made a video on this, it was taken down as well
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina Gamesnosh was mentioned in one of them, they were taken down for writing something more neutral presenting facts
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina Jaffe talked directly to kotaku, hes a large fish, small devs will get absolutely wrecked for speaking out
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina Which is being targeted as well.
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina It runs on the censorship we faced against gaming journos, and forum mods, preventing discussion nearly everywhere
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina No one important can speak out, or they face the feminist mob to bully them into submission
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina Not saying they're bad, but when you speak out even a little, you get labeled as sexist
@AshleyKJude @er0tikka "Blocked" wow you sound like a feminist gaming journalist.
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina That needs to be changed as well, but #gamergate focuses more on transparency. That is another major issue.
@TheAuracl3 @jennytablina When you write against feminists, you get backlash, people are afraid of them. They are deeply rooted in the media

@Newegg 140 chars is not enough to express what I feel about Kotaku, as such, I will refuse to buy from newegg since you support them
@Jimdandy26 @nickwcoleman The kony part slipped past me as I focused on the more seemingly important question of which # to use.
@nickwcoleman This isn't about Zoe anymore, drop it, or they will try to turn it into a gender issue, #GamerGate is about Gaming Journalism

Read: 
@UllCon @JimSterling People have the right to discuss shady things in the industry, many speculate that her info leak on tumblr was fake.
@curtisfglenn Look, proof is out there, some of it damning/reaching. All you gotta do is search.ZoeQuinn is very deceitful, just ask her ex.
@UllCon @munsosl @JimSterling Okay lets say thats true, lets why delete EVERYONES posts? There is a valid discussion going on with Zoe
@munsosl @JimSterling They are supposed to ban the discussion of Zoe Quinn? Her getting dox seems very staged, she knows how to play victim
@munsosl @JimSterling No one seriously thought that,but there is proof of the moderator contacting quinn himself, afterwards mass bans start
@JonTronShow Jon, the final decision is yours, but I really think some of us are really depending on you to put it things in perspective...

@DavidVonderhaar Will weapons be more varied? BLOPS1 had 750/973 rof weapons only, will we see variation in this one?
@DavidVonderhaar Not sure if your the right person to ask but, will BLOPS2 guns be more varied than BLOPS1?
No 750/973 rof only guns right?
@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN Any possibility we can see a new snatcher? :)
Or anything along those lines, I loved the story from it.
