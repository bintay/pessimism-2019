@JeremiahJPierce exactly we need a strong winger and reus is versatile to play anywhere
@JeremiahJPierce we might keep him and then he will pull a lewandowski but I would try to get reus as a replacement too justin case
@JeremiahJPierce idk but depends how well he does in the World Cup will determine if anyone wants him he never does well in cups for england
@JRSmith89 either way will work haha
@JeremiahJPierce exactly but his flaw is tracking back unlike Rooney where he is everywhere that's why we need a box to box like Vidal
