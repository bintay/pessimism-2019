@scottlabrie @DoritosCanada sarcasm bud, sarcasm
@Graydio1 @CBCEyeopener surprised, impressed, optimistic and definitely happy. The state of AB now speaks volumes of PC mismanagement.
@ABDanielleSmith thanks for everything you did anyways!!
Alright @dave_khan we are finally voting the PC's out of Alberta tonight! Let's do this thing... #abvote2015
@DoritosCanada just quit while you're ahead and people are still tolerating your orange crap, ok? Thx
@Genesis_Land SNES is better.
@SamMaggs yeah that still happens to me all the time. They should set you up with a 24hr monitor and EKG. No idea what causes it for me...
@MPLaurieHawn @LBLCA wow, can't believe you would tweet this. Can believe you actually feel this way, but still... Zero shame sir #classy
@jaaxed @Crackmacs 
@mikesbloggity you pretty important hipster dude you!
@CBCNews yeah great, just what we need here. Why don't they just send them back #ffs
@_kittylouise Mine too. Everything they do is just so good and pure and raw.
@wearewhitehorse saw you last night... Phenominal performance! Have a great tour and thanks for the music <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@kaitkucy @TheBeltliner Yeppers, it's a nice walk over :)
@TheBeltliner @kaitkucy oh it's deliciousss. Went for brunch on Friday... The hash browns were my fave!
Man oh man... @Chairlifted needs to release some more Japanese music videos. Please.
@CalgarySenate Pumpkin JESUS?
@FFWDWeekly oh man, that truly sucks! <CONFOUNDED FACE>
@anneosullivan @kaitkucy I wasn't home. I swear it wasn't me burning the toast again...
@anneosullivan @AirCanada yesss, always #late Air Canada. 
@Crockatteer @EnrightCBC @CBCSunday Jesus Joan, step away from the Twitter machine, please.
@curlybecs Nice! do you like Warpaint as well? 90% of my tunes are female vocalists... I really adore Beach House and Warpaint. My two faves
@curlybecs &lt;3 Beach House.
@_warpaint adore your music. Just picked up Exquisite Corpse and the self titled LP on vinyl. Thanks for being so magical.
@BasiaBulat @calgaryfolkfest you were amazing tonight! Thanks for the great show... Love your voice!!!
@BasiaBulat @calgaryfolkfest so excited to hear you again very sooooon <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@KarenManer your writing is special. Really enjoyed Hugo, thanks!
Stare into your dates eyes for four minutes and... fall in #love? Via @nytimes 
@Poletical and this one as well.
@Poletical and this one.
@Poletical I'm glad you're paying for this tweet of mine.
Well, the toilet no longer flushes itself every ten minutes. My work here is done *teleports back to the Starship Enterprise bar*
@breaking aka twitter
@EasyCarLoansYYC uhh this link doesn't go to a 1 minute car loan application...
@lindsayhamel @somers_bob lol yeah she brought that up for sure, but she also said he was very, very nice... Not as cranky as House MD lol
@lindsayhamel hey congratulations! I was visiting nana yesterday and she gave me the news... Too cool!
@EnergyEast page doesn't exist.
@CBC180 @Ward4Ward1 easier to try and blame the people trying to cross the street, who incidentally aren't at fault the majority of the time
@Ward4Ward1 @CBC180 It sure is... The vast majority of ped collisions here are caused by drivers. Why not focus on that?
@CBC180 @Ward4Ward1 This mentality reminds me of people who blame climate change on the sun. Go back to driver's ed and drive responsibly.
@Crackmacs niiice
@peopleofYYC lol yes, the internet does tend to attract the crazies.
@Crackmacs nice nice... 100mbps down?
@peopleofYYC haha little faith in the general population?
@peopleofYYC probably because there are plenty of other far more legitimate criticisms for the taking...
@CBCMeg @johangreg sad.
@CarriePotter_ Lol wut
@peopleofYYC @ENMAX pics or it didn't happen <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@SennheiserCAN @DavidSpodek so is the contest open to us Kanadians? Also have you considered @SennheiserKAN <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@CBCAlerts 
@Teradata_Apps I'll be happy when you tell us we really need to know... what color underwear is the old man wearing?
@CBCNews 
Alright, have some @CATPOWER on the table... Should be a nice morning start. #tunage #analog 
@Crackmacs which network?
@BadLibrarian perfect example of their lack of respect for democracy. It's frustrating people vote for them despite this bs.
@purpledcake I also put some crystals on my shelf... People probably think I'm some crazy person <GHOST>
@purpledcake hmm there was that crazy lady with all the feathers at firebag... Maybe start with a little #terrarium? 
@DavidSpodek @SennheiserCAN also, "Kanada"... Really? Lol
@TransitVenture oh man the only thing better than winning a bus pass would be winning this buss pass!
@EvanMcFatridge @KathyAlexiou @CBCNews ok cool, I agree. Just wanted to clarify the reach of Cargill for people who shop elsewhere
@EvanMcFatridge @KathyAlexiou @CBCNews of course, Wal-Mart is selling beef their supplier is recalling. Perfect.
@SamMaggs 90s Gwen ftw.
@EvanMcFatridge @KathyAlexiou @CBCNews Cargill is the largest meat supplier in Canada. They supply grocery stores, mcd's, wendys, Costco etc
@headfonia and it plays dsd!
@CBCTheSignal Ohh it's the unmistakable voice of Lykke Li. Very nice, thank you. #serene

@pizzavenkman no worries, just swing by your local Blockbuster and I'm sure they'll have it on vhs <VIDEOCASSETTE>
.@PizzaPops is your display pic seriously a subliminal woman with pizza pops as a bra? Pretty sad dudes...
Lmao and now the cup is broken...
Watching this cfl grey cup presentation reminds me of watching those old wwf wrestling interviews, with the crazy managers #awkward
There's something off-putting about seeing PC food in Shoppers Drug Mart, and Sobey's food in Safeway... #worldscolliding
Few things are more disappointing than getting to the gym, turning on the iPod, and hearing "battery low" #doh
@ShawFireLog are you available in hi-def with surround smoke?
@tipsy_writer <OPEN HANDS SIGN><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><WAVING HAND SIGN><HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>

@peopleofYYC Very interesting tweets all week long... Good job Izzy!
Sat night advice.. Turn off ur alarm clock app before passing out tonight. Kinda sucks waking up at 6am to Bon Iver on repeat from ur pocket
@VeganCalgary niice. We were at Wurst tonight but missed the carolers. I think this should be a thing right up until like Christmas.
@tipsy_writer nice I'm jealous
Genius idea to replace manual push/pull doors w/ automatic doors that freeze shut in the winter. #greatjob! #talisman 
@gennyloves crazy girl! Good job.
@gennyloves running?
@tcdixon3 @CIAwesome Nice! Also, to avoid unleashing the gates of hell, keep your tree hydrated... 
@fuckyeahcbc thx you too <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@CBCNews 
@kahht all I can think of 
When did sleeping in until noon become so seemingly impossible?
@voyagevixen for sure! I keep an old pair of coveralls in mine too... Easy to throw on, so nice clothes don't get all dirty changing tires.
@PCFinancial the link doesn't seem to work... Did you have another?
@librariangraff @anneosullivan I want one of those hats they had on. Very festive.
TIL that people shave Brussels sprouts. Also, that they aren't called Brussel sprouts.
@BanffCentreLit are crocks ok?
@Canada or "Banana"?
@PCFinancial your link is broken
@calgarytransit thx
@calgarytransit I lost a Mr potato head figure on one of the buses today. Any chance it turned up? He has a mustache and cigar.
@AIRMILES Tis the season to shop shop shop and spend spend spend! Consumerism consumerism consumerism! Yay for money! Yay for debt!
@GlobalCalgary From my adventurous frame of reference, best to watch for obstreperous, lecherous drivers on these treacherous roads.
@CBCCanada clean shaven Jian somehow looks infinitely more creepier...
@PMCSpeakers so my twenty.21's seem to be broken in... Nice, airy and beautiful tonality. Thanks for the amazing speakers.
@ElementFleet cool how do I follow
Can we get drizzle squall trending? @TrendsCalgary: 'squall' is now trending in #Calgary 
@GiantBlueRing it's a freezing drizzle squall.
@Crackmacs @660News @CBCCalgary hey now, who wouldn't want to live in a city with exploding manhole drizzle squalls?
@Crackmacs @660News @CBCCalgary ahh yes, the classic drizzle squall... Perfectly fine, perfectly healthy #evacuatestosecretundergroundbunker
@JennBlairCBC @SBTCalgary @CBCHomestretch you're a crook capt hook, judge won't you throw the book at the pirate!
@660News @Crackmacs @CBCCalgary wait so is it drizzle or squall? I'm confused now...
@CBCCalgary oh god... Not freezing drizzle! For shizzle?
@CATPOWER take it away... Give it away!!<MUSICAL NOTE><MUSICAL NOTE><MUSICAL NOTE>
@LCDClassAction huh
@SHO_Masters I love your show and all, but just watched the end of season two and now I feel depressed...
All I want to do is stay home and listen to Miles Davis on sacd. #&lt;3music
@peopleofYYC it's definitely more accepted in more progressive provinces/states. It also depends on the doctor... Much like traditional phds
@peopleofYYC naturopathic medicine could help him out... My naturopath took regular blood tests and was very thorough.
@Ruth_Goodwin @globeandmail loved it. Would enjoy reading more of your writing for sure!
@CBCCanada can we get the gif version of the dancing banana next time there is a hacked website story? Please
@CanadianTire I look forward to collecting, tracking and redeeming 'Canadian' 'Tire' 'Money'
@Bayer4Crops it also tastes delicious microwaved on med for 7 mins, smothered in anchovy paste with 20 Bayer<REGISTERED SIGN> Aspirin<REGISTERED SIGN> tabs &amp; 1 box of wine.
@vornietom probably Theo.
@CBC180 every time in BC is high time.
@stephenlautens @pmoharper lol that jacket is comedy gold. Love the posed "war room" shots from the Calgary flood with him and Redford.

me: ok but what were u wearing
him: why does it mat…
@zacharypace I share your adoration for @CATPOWER and also listen to her daily... Haven't heard her live yet, but it's on my bucket list
Yay for trees falling on power lines #offworkearly #yaynature
@joe_dante @BarbiturateCat @netflix yesss, so many one liners. "It came with the frame..."
@StoriesFrom17th @WestJet flying Westjet this morning for work after a bunch of AC trips and everyone is so much happier. Even at 5am...
@thisbrogan @RdioCA have you caught Creep on Creepin' on? It's also excellent.
@danielasings laser surgery also works well, if you're tired of contacts...
@JonBallard72 @CBCNews it does, that's the sad part.
@scotiabank how much do the account alerts cost?
@voyagevixen yes, I'm glad they went for it. It's harsh how so many people stay silent. Nuts that he may have treated ppl that way as well.
@CBCHomestretch my favourite night of the year! #extrazzzzz
@lenadunham should visit Transylvania in the off season, far less spirits and such. Kind of nice and peaceful, really.
@Eggbeck Unless your dog is... Frankenweenie <GHOST>
@undeadmolly right up there with "enjoy the show" at the movie theatre.
@CBC @CanadasSmartest spikey hair, black shoes, devil horns, blue dot, shirt buttons, dress colour, Mic, under shirt colour, lack of heels
@HealthyCdns can you specifically explain how? This seems like some sort of scientific hogwash... Not what I expect from my government.
@getbetterapp go away please.

I'm also in fort mcmurray right now. At the airport.
Watching hockey and wondering when a cannon became the logo for Columbus. Also, when Columbus became a team. #sports
@CalgarySenate This "ThanksGiving", I'm thankful for your investigative reporting L..ry (cue cymbal smash) #yyconspiracies
Ahoy sexy!
People who write "should of" ...
@CBCEyeopener yup... I fell for this one... Really wanted it to be real. 
@cbcbooks @lenadunham heck yes!! Really looking forward to it. She is an amazingly talented individual!
@gennyloves Ohh excellent. A mini guest of honour.
@gennyloves was the mini pumpkin somehow involved in the dinner as well?
@andreasimmskarp @CBCTheSignal do it!

@danielasings just discovered your cover of Crazy... Chilling! When are you playing Calgary and where can I buy your stuff in CD quality?
@EugeneMirman was he wearing a black turtleneck?
@ericwareheim <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@WestJet great news, thanks!
Mr. Tea just steeping out... love it. 
@SamPlasencia super sad to see you go... You were my fave. Very stylish and also really enjoyed your personality. #:(
@CanadaGoneKiwi totally. I got suckered into this whole "let's quit coffee" thing and now my mornings are no longer ftw.
Day #3 sans #coffee... The world is a bleak, desolated wasteland.
@CrystalMully hey, yes the new job is going well thanks... Howrudoin?
Trying to decide which is #creepier... Couples who look alike or dogs and owners who look alike...
@mykeatkinson hey yeah for sure... I will need to get everything going again and come by. Life is decent, hope you're well too!
@scotiabank Y are there maximum returns if the GICs are invested in shares? If the shares perform better than the max ur capping the profit?
@bearflagwine @XFestCalgary tried the red blend and surprisingly delicious... Impressive.
@ESET where can we buy the hat your back to school model is wearing? Asking for a friend.
@althiaraj Whenever I see the new terminal, I'm hungry for some nice fluffy pancakes...
The great debate whether to smoke a joint before or after watching the new Woody Allen movie.
My biggest concern while shopping for clothing is its legitimacy. #notanymore 
@FacesPics happy coffee cup. <GRINNING FACE> 
@SamPlasencia your ice cream shirt #ftw
The tour of 17th Ave this weekend included musical-garbage-can-people being strip searched by Calgary police in #cowboy hats. #yyc


@CBCArts @EmilyHampshire_ awesome, loved that movie. So interesting and clever. Looking forward to the show
Tell me more about everything in your life, and the lives of your family and friends, random plane buddy.
I thought it would be more cathartic to actually finally quit, but anxiety about changing jobs is overwhelming. #Hrmm.
@purpledcake sucks. maybe it will get better miraculously before 2015?
@LandRoverCanada does it come with adult diapers so that your drivers can shit themselves as well without making a mess?
@JadeaKelly hey Jadea, really enjoyed hearing you at #cfmf2014. I was trying to buy Clover on vinyl, did you have a link?
@Snowblinksays rocking #cfmf2014 - Nicely done. Always happy to hear you live!

Beautiful music today under the sun with @tinyruins #cfmf2014 #yyc

#derp MT [sic] @seanchucalgary: Now I knew why some ppl complain abt innerrcity b/c innerrcity has lowest density. 
@daybreakalberta @reuben_thedark sounded great! Where can we pick up the CD in Calgary?
@CBCNews also for personal classification, I'm upset as well, but have a grip on my anger. Let the evidence present itself, please ffs.
@CBCNews comments like these are exactly why the lawyers complained. Morons who are angry and assume since someone is arrested, they did it.
To be read in his voice...Rick MacInnes-Rae says goodbye 
@kenthehr and I'll be voting for you again Kent, thanks!!
@WSunexpected I can't believe that you'd be condoning this abhorrent behavior on Twitter. #reported #notfunny
@ABTransComm Also: if you don't feel like you're ready to die, perhaps you should not ride a motorcycle. #vrmmvrmm
@oakenwork or pretty much whenever we can find jobs near there.
@oakenwork sweet. I have a thing for Victoria Legrand's vocals... So enchanting. Also, we're probably moving to Toronto in the next 2 yrs...
But, Beach House is coming to #yyc in Sept, so I guess there this that.
So Lena Dunham is being interviewed by other cool ppl like Miranda July &amp; Carrie Brownstein.. damn. Totally want to be there instead of here
@CBCNews Everyone knows the smartest people in the country are also the die hard patriots. See the American south for example #intellectuals
@Miranda_July oh man, I so want to fly down to California to see two of my very favorite people in this world...
@tmasterfsarcasm what is this bullshit you're posting?
@pitchforkmedia @BeaccchHoussse Calgary!? Yesssssssss
Silly @westjet... Random passenger boarding is quicker than your fancy new formalized boarding-by-row. 
@AmexCanada I think it's sketchy carrying a gold card around. #attractstheft I'll stick with plastic thanks.
I'm sorry ma'am, but you can't sit here. This seat is reserved for holding my coffee while I text about the other people waiting to board.
I dunno about you, but I take my Calgary souvenir shirts splattered with oil and blood. 
People at the airport leaving Calgary... There is no reason for you to dress up like a cowboy. You can wear regular people clothes.
This x 1,000,000. 
@pizzavenkman Yesss, Calgaryisms. Seriously I just can't get over the fishnets, makeup, and high heels. So many bad decisions...
@pizzavenkman oh god, "sexy Stampede cow" returns. #shudder

Amazing... Such a talent!! RT @indigogreenroom: Calgary customers that arrived early for our David Sedaris event... 
@triplespot now this one is definitely #photoshopped. I can spot the pixels.
@triplespot Amazing, I could have sworn those kids were photoshopped into that canoe.
@oakenwork nice yeah I read that last year, love Hemingway. The best part about reading David Sedaris is that everything is in his voice.
@oakenwork all of them, except holidays on ice. When You're Engulfed in Flames is my fave.
@oakenwork yeah man he's the man.
@oakenwork ha ha that's the funny thing. Just in some random Indigo in Calgary. But still. It's David SEDARIS.
@PolysporinCA what game is this because it looks awesome.

Tonight- DAVID SEDARIS. so excited.
@CalgaryParking @Calgarytransit nice. I'll have a sweet spot to park my plane.
@StoriesFrom17th ;) inbreeding = interesting.
@FalkenTire do you follow back because I only follow tire Twitter accounts that follow back.
@CalgaryParking Street parking as well?
@DoritosCanada I think it's despicable to promote gambling with your taco chips. #shame
@660News @Crackmacs ok and if you'll just say "ahh" for me. Perfect! 

In all seriousness though, hope they find him.
@StubHub what is Calgary's most anticipated event?
@triplespot #photoshopped lake. I can tell by the pixels.
@CBCWeather @CBCAlerts this would make much more sense if it was in both official languages...
@Jack_Astors what do you mean when you say hang out?
@StoriesFrom17th conduction = construction?

@Equip_Soft yes
@Equip_Soft sorry, which ad?
@TD_Canada @askrbc hijacking another banks sponsored tweet is just soooo sleazy guys. #amirite
@cityofcalgary Thanks you're too kind. I plan on flying though.
@Equip_Soft I don't understand how to click on your follow link. Can you elaborate please, thanks!
@cityofcalgary unless it isn't free cos then I'll just like ride the bus cos then it's like totally worth more! So what's the deal?
@cityofcalgary yes, is transit free because if I have to pay like omg,  I might as well just walk. Which I'll probably do even if it's free.
@CalgaryFast and bbq.
@CalgaryFast ohhh ok so "that" Friday. Excellent. Sorry, I can't come as I'm deathly allergic to pancakes.
@StoriesFrom17th hmmm conduction sounds inbreeding.
@CalgaryFast This Friday like in four days, or the Friday after next? Or which Friday? Sorry, so confusing when you use "this" that way...
@mansionimporter how 'bout no? Mmmkay thx, bai.
@CBCCalgary @nadia_stewart @tfcbccgy Gut wrenching feeling watching these cuts. Big thanks to all the talented folks for sure.
.@CBCJeffDouglas @CBC @cbcradio Love so much about listening to CBC on the radio. So informative, entertaining and truly Canadian.
Any movie with Beach House in the trailer has to be excellent... Blue is the Warmest Color tonight.
@hpliszka The weird thing is they often reject social programs that have solid statistics indicating better economics.It's crazy living here
@hpliszka That is an interesting question actually... Why are the majority of Albertans conservative?
@richardeinarson @MSN_Quebec 
@MadeForMen we tweet about ridiculous gender related stereotypes because we're a soap company ran by morons.
@CBCCalgary well now you've gone and ruined the surprise!

@Windows @autoTRADER_ca The only way I see this working out is if you somehow infiltrate my dreams.

@intelcanada ohhhh! I've always wanted to downsize my bag! Thanks Intel.
@cibc where's the rainbow flag CIBC? Not going to say who I'm disappointed at, but I am looking in your general area...

@laundra1 @CBCNews what would you prefer to see? I'm curious as to how a picture of the two refugees isn't fitting enough for you, lol.
Awesome job @caroloffcbc! RT @CBCNews: Syrian refugee applications quietly sped up by Ottawa 
@laundra1 @CBCNews if you had read the caption, they're refugees coming to Canada.

@CommonSenseYYC Labeling your opinion as common sense doesn't necessarily make it so.
@cbchh @CBCNews I think this mindset and these comments are shared by the people who vote for his party. No big surprise from McKay...
@WestJet it's all good anyway, I just thought your site would always be the best spot to book. No big deal, I'll just be aware <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><AIRPLANE>
@WestJet it unfortunately is the case... I called customer service and they said flight centre must have bought the seats cheap. RUEXPY con#
@WestJet sad, I booked last night from

@CrystalMully Dude... I am so clueless when it comes to these cuisinieries.
@schuzam ha ha. Ok i totally approve m&amp;ms deep fried on popcorn, just to clarify. And deep fried pickles in separate instances.
@schuzam lol no! Not on popcorn silly. In general. Deep fried pickles, ftw.
@CrystalMully oh, Anne clued me in... Hot dogs, ok.
@CrystalMully what is this? Pretzel machine or?
@schuzam oh god i would experiment with everything... Pickles especially.
@Nathan_Pensky with like his male pattern baldness, and such?
@hannahmusic still listening to your self titled album daily... Such a great release! Every track is catchy and gushing with your talent.
@CBCNews the school was right to enforce their dress code, as they weren't dressed professionally. Blaming them as a distraction is terrible
@CBCNews Glad you reported this. The newsworthy part is the schools "these girls are a distraction" response. Blaming girls is not right.
@CrystalMully @anneosullivan but this one is just so quiet and peaceful!
@Crazy4cars2 @voyagevixen nice plate too!

@voyagevixen Decent promotions at Hotel Palomar, and a nice pool. I'm happy here, we also checked out Valley Ho but way too many dude bros.

@CanadaGoneKiwi good old Calgary... Lots of people doing the tire swap. Everyone is booked up until Dec 1, so Costco has the 5am line. :P

@CBCAlerts this all from an appointment to the senate by @pmharper, who also defended her expenses... What a scam. 
@evansolomoncbc please for the love of god, confiscate and destroy any cowboy hats that may be accompanying you on that flight #cpc13
@FFWDWeekly @WePunchCows but when paired with a sexy black cowboy vest, how could you not vote for this man? 
@CBCHomestretch Is Frank covering for @cbcDougDirks because of a mustache injury?
@FFWDWeekly I wish Alberta valued government transparency, accountability and the parliamentary process. AB &amp; Harper value power and money.
@Domofix Big congrats Dom! You're so creative and talented, way to go!
And suddenly Toronto appears to be having a very happy Halloween...
@yuppielove green grass! Jealous. I was planning a trip to Comox to visit the folks soon... the Calgary snow motivates. Still jet lagged tho
Back in Canada... Hitting the treadmill hard this week.
Leaving Sydney and landing in Vancouver before we took off... Then flying to Calgary and landing when we left Sydney #timetravel
Watching the sunrise over the Sydney Opera House #gorgeous #aus 
@CanadaGoneKiwi yeah totally wanted to do NZ... We'll have to do a trip there next
Met Captain Sindre aboard @RoyalCaribbean Radiance of the Seas this morning! #awesomevacation #aus 
So, #yyc will I be coming home to my mayor next week, or a bumbling, redneck bbq king? 
Alright, slept in until 9:30am this morning! Finally over the jet lag. Now to figure out what day it is...
A slow, rocking sleep on the ship last night... In Newcastle today, relaxing over some strong Aussie coffee
Crazy bird at the Botanical Gardens. 
Oh look, @anneosullivan made a friend in Sydney! #snail

Breakfast from our hotel in Manly... went for a beautiful run along the beach this morning as the sun came up. #aus 
Survived the 16 hour flight! here is a shot from yesterday of @SydOperaHouse from the ferry to Manly #gorgeous #aus 
Probably drooling on my neighbour at 50,000 feet... Or something like that. Four hours into the flight to Aussie land. #ativan
Oh, to be an Air Canada Elite Gold Star member, and board the plane two minutes before everyone else... #someday #yvr to #syd

Hey @TalismanCentre just wondering what the workers hanging from the ropes near the pool are working on? Roof repairs or Cirque Du Talisman?
So Sydney is a day ahead, but also 8 hours behind... Basically, I just need to stay up super late tonight and try to sleep in. #deal
@anneosullivan where is the koala emoji for twitter? #Australia
@silverfoot99 gorgeous shot! I will just have to figure out where yxe is now ;) Saskatchewan, right?
@AllyRohland nice! You ever listen to @CBCTheSignal with Laurie Brown? She plays Lord Huron and other such great artists.
@CBCCalgary Wondering what ward you are? Perhaps you should reconsider the 6 hours of tv you're watching daily and read some news/books...
@CBCJeffDouglas yes, then we got into the whole Curried Soul debate, it made for a great ride from the Strip to Fremont.
@peopleofYYC hey Mark, what's your account if we want to #ff you?
@CBCJeffDouglas I was in Vegas and a cabbie asked about the flood when he heard I was from #yyc... Said he listens to AIH every night. Cool.
@CBCHomestretch Those "mini tornadoes" are sketchy. You can easily understand just how powerful nature can be after experiencing them...
@VegaTeam Really enjoying the Recovery Accelerator post runs. Really pushing myself knowing it's waiting for me afterwards #healthy
So beautiful today #yyc, but chilly enough to know you're itching for some snow. The countdown to swap on the winter tires begins... #brr

@CBCCalgary [there was an error processing this directive]
@anneosullivan better than Sparrow Nights?
@taxpayerDOTcom Or, in other words... Would your preference be for the city to consult on environmental issues with a pro oil sands org? #ha
@taxpayerDOTcom how about the govt of AB/BC? Stat Oil? BP? Environment Canada? Conoco, Shell, Suncor? Would u prefer to not hear both sides?
@Jokes_Ahoy @CBCNews I care, and fuck people who joke about raping an underage girl. It will not be tolerated. Give your head a shake dude.

@CanadaGoneKiwi hope everything is going well for her!
@cbcDougDirks @CBCHomestretch Fancy that. Was she wearing a hat? I'm guessing her name was Pat, from down at the laundromat.
"Nobody sees anybody truly but all through the flaws of their own egos. That is the way we all see each other in life."
@anneosullivan @TalismanCentre excellent! Me and 19 of my closest friends will be very happy
@ruebyretro we had German camping neighbours last weekend in Banff!
Great conversations often begin with, "Do you even know how to hang pants!?" Thanks to an angry old man working at Tip Top Tailors, TIL how.
@kenthehr Hope you're having a good summer Kent. Thanks for being our MLA! Keep up the excellent work.
@CanadaGoneKiwi @getbeef my idea: they ride your delivery to your house! But then I guess they also need to pack a tiny bicycle to get back.
Just cooking up a big pot of lentils.. May have to invite @bodybreak over to help eat all these lentils! Hungry for lentils @bodybreak? #yum
I camped and hiked a lot this weekend. For now I plan on walking like a broken robot. #stifffff

.@alanacbaker so you're telling me those pepper spray and cowboy hat ads in Calgary Police News Magazine were a bad investment? #seemedlegit
@CBCCalgary Sad. This will stop someday very soon, when people learn to accept we're all human and in life together.
@ruebyretro ha ha awesome. I tried that but they wouldn't change the delivery address... It's literally 300 steps from our building.
@ruebyretro UPS does that too. Doesn't even leave a delivery notice note, then you have to call &amp; pick it up at the airport... #greatservice
@benrankel Mmmmm, sidewalk gum!

@cityofcalgary best of luck and thank you for the updates.
So happy to hear about everyone so exited to have their power back.Like little kids at Christmas waiting for Santa @Enmax #yycflood #mission
@heatherangeline it's all good, I'm sure Enmax turned on our circuit, we'd just need the breaker/switch flipped on by anyone with a key
@Crackmacs lawl bring amber lamps!
@heatherangeline hmm normally it should be locked, but the switch/breaker should be left on. #hoping @anneosullivan @yuppielove
@heatherangeline lol Im an electrician, I'll turn it on :P @Enmax do you ask for condo main breakers to be left on? 317 19ave sw is our bldg
@benrankel @JulietBurgess when we leave out the sidedoor of our bldg, we see directly into our neighbours shower. It is amazingly creepy...
@benrankel @JulietBurgess @LGYYC @richardllam @VickiStroich @samdles @ryanwriter @fionastaples cheer up peeps! Cold beers soon #mission&lt;3
@heatherangeline It's so amazing how much people want to help out. I really hope everyone just becomes addicted to that spirit of community
Mission support &amp; a great event! please RT and join us!! 
@yuppielove hey Kait I'm having trouble viewing it with that link on fb.. any chance there is a way to search for it on fb? #missionpossible
@anneosullivan hrmmmm, perhaps. I am also concerned about the state of the restorative effects of my gut.
@heatherangeline I'll bring some in Thursday night/Friday morning! Anything else? #missionpossible
@Crackmacs @redcrosscanada there are other communities than just us ;)
@Angie_D_Rhyme @benrankel @heatherangeline @yuppielove @kaimcn @Brunnhofer is it on now at 19th ave?
@benrankel @heatherangeline @yuppielove @kaimcn @Brunnhofer enmax estimates power by 10pm tonight!!
@fuckyeahcbc @teganandsara on vinyl no less. Nicely done!
@lbourgon @anneosullivan good to hear. Watch #missionpossible for community support in the next couple days and pass it along!
@lbourgon @anneosullivan hmm not sure (probably it was). We used to live there. Do you have a place to stay temporarily? Hope every1 is ok!
@heatherangeline Aww! Hope power comes back soon! Do you need candles or flashlights or anything at all? Let us know!
@heatherangeline @Brunnhofer @FoldableHuman @benrankel u staying at 19th w/o power? we found a temp place in the nw for friday onwards...
@heatherangeline I fly in Thursday and I'm planning on helping too! Excited to put on my big green Dunlop boots #yycfloods
@heatherangeline great idea! do u have a website with details on the card Heather? If we're eligible would u mind emailing with details?
@TalismanCentre @cityofcalgary thanks for the update! Let me know if you need any volunteers, I'd love to help out.
.@cityofcalgary and @TalismanCentre ? Any idea how they're making out with the mechanical rooms/basement?
@Brunnhofer power for Taco Tuesday may be what some would consider an early Festivus miracle... #yycfloods @cjsw
@Brunnhofer @heatherangeline @FoldableHuman @benrankel nice, so gas I take it? Are you moved back or waiting on power?
@heatherangeline you still planning a trip in tomorrow? I called emerald &amp; they don't have keys yet but we were hoping to grab one in the am
*facepalm* RT @kaimcn: Have to prove residency to get govt assistance. Every letter I've ever gotten thrown out due to water damage.
@heatherangeline I totally feel that. So, so mental this last week. I flew out to work Thursday morning and have been checking relentlessly
.@aldjohnmar You are like the energizer rabbit. Thank you so much for your awesome updates and extreme dedication to our city! #yycfloods
@heatherangeline @Brunnhofer @FoldableHuman @benrankel hmm substation must be near the river... Perhaps it's the one near stampede grounds?
Looks like all of Mission... MT @cityofcalgary: map of areas of downtown that remain closed to the public: 
@Brunnhofer @heatherangeline MT @FoldableHuman: @benrankel Substatn 1 is still taking on water; likely won't be ready 4 evaluation til Wed.
Also, the semi had three full size chrome ram heads on it, and Nickelback music played throughout the entire thing.
I had this crazy nightmare last night that I had to drive Chad Kroeger around in this crazy semi-truck looking for women for him to pick up.
@anneosullivan Elvis and Trent should be happy. Don't know about that produce though... ;) #yycfloods #mission #safeway
.@anneosullivan you missed the free pizza... Also, the nuns are ok! "@wopizza: The nuns were happy to see us 
@heatherangeline @anneosullivan @yuppielove we can keep in touch with ppl and tweet on any info. I'm away as well up north at work...
@ryanwriter @yuppielove @benrankel smart move. Our alley is super safe I think anyway. Old men on balconies in their skivvies #alleyangels
@kaimcn almost looks like a little private beach vista...
@yuppielove sweet! Glad to hear you made the trek alright. @anneosullivan is staying down south probably til we get power back
@yuppielove how'd it go getting to 19th? I'm so hoping things are sorted by Thursday...
@yuppielove @ryanwriter @benrankel Did you leave your car there Ryan or drive it out Thurs?
@ryanwriter @yuppielove @benrankel is Madison the one beside us towards 4th? Outdoor parking was looking nice &amp; dry in the alley behind 19th
@heatherangeline hello! Thanks for your updates. Any idea about power? #yycfloods (@anneosullivan is excited to see our fridge) :P
@FFWDWeekly RT  @lubeyisms: Macleod trail,
crazy. Stolen from phuck3m's photo 
@benrankel (not at home yet obviously sorry, but waiting to hear about power)
@benrankel let me know if you hear... I'll do the same. We're in Taymar on 19th
@CBCScott Do you know if the substation is still powered up/providing power, or are they using a different system temporarily?
.@Brunnhofer we're still without power on 19th ave and 3rd/4th... Hope Cliff Bungalow has better luck, our email said 2 or 3 days #yycfloods
Darn. MT @Grandmotherwolf: 25th ave bridge closed indefinitely ... @CalgaryPolice watching out for us #yycflood 
@anneosullivan 
@anneosullivan yeah I was looking at the aerial shots and @Talismancentre looked ok... Lindsey Park not so much... #yycflood
@BraydonBeaulieu @benrankel I hear ya. Our street wasn't shown as an evac yet the police evacd and we still don't have power. It's ok though
Damnnnnnnn RT @lubeyisms: Macleod trail,
crazy. Stolen from phuck3m's photo 
@CrystalMully ha i was totally thinking that. #90s
@benrankel aha Ben you're awesome my friend. Followed.
@giarcharas yipes just heard about the power troubles now in Banff... Hope everyone is safe and sound!
@anneosullivan how's the hotdog party going?
@CBCEyeopener @CBCHomestretch thank you for the amazing efforts keeping everyone informed! Listening from work up north via am740 simulcasts
@CubReporterK @yuppielove @benrankel @ryanwriter seems cruel to expect people back that early...hard to even get across/around downtown
@yuppielove ahh there is some other stuff in the email about the building. I can fwd it if you like. (Stuff you'll need to get in)
Alley looks good too. Taymar parking garage is dry... Hopefully neighboring buildings too @anneosullivan @yuppielove 
@Marjalea haven't seen any pics yet of 22ave and 2st sw but maybe @kylegarrett might have some... Fingers crossed for ya! #mission #yycflood
Amazing!!! Rt @yuppielove: 19th Ave &amp; 2nd Street! #mission #yycflood “@Angie_D_Rhyme: @yuppielove our street is ok ! 
@CrystalMully lol by the looks of that picture, the second floor might not be... Guess we'll see when we get home. I'm at work until Thurs.
Omg... @KYLEGARRETT: Mission is fully submerged. (Taken from Holy Cross Hospital rooftop).#YYCFlood #ABFlood #YYC

@AKindOfAlexness Sorry we weren't able to have a civilized chat. If you ever change your mind I'd be happy to discuss #cdnpoli later
@AKindOfAlexness meh, your dismissive remarks to other comments don't mean this is politics as usual. I prefer debating facts with others.
@AKindOfAlexness yes I'm quite new to seeing the PMO sending out dirty news leaks to the media... You cool with it? 
Yeah, me either.
U know when ur shirt feels all awkward in the sleeve/shoulder all day long so finally at like 3pm u dig around &amp; pull out a pair of panties?
@giarcharas @CanadaGoneKiwi excellent. May I suggest making up lyrics about other drivers? Probably best done windows up, though.
@CanadaGoneKiwi car singing can be so cathartic #punintended. I usually roll up the windows at red lights though. Stage fright and all that.
@CanadaGoneKiwi where's the cabin? Cabin camping is pretty sophisticated... I'm still just a tenter.
Ahh so close guys. He's in Toronto, not Montreal! #harhar
I was thinking it might be time to trash my 7 year old DCs &amp; pick out some more age appropriate shoes/or become a pro skater. Yes, that one.
My singing sounds, like, a billion times better in the shower. I swear...
@yuppielove yep, definitely heard that one.
@AKindOfAlexness I think Harper is struggling for dirt on Trudeau and this is the best he can find. Merely a distraction from the real dirt.
@AKindOfAlexness @CBCNews I don't think it's classless for a speaker to expect a fee. Do you think everyone in politics should work pro bono
Oh to be the person killing the fly on the wall that's you...
I assure you that pushing the walk button in an obsessive rhythmic pattern multiple times until the light changes is entirely necessary.

Snapped my shoelace today at work, then tripped on my shoelace on the treadmill. Shoelace karma. #notcool

Dude, when did Alex Trebek's hair go completely white? #doublejeopardy
Ack, chemical imbalance. #blah
@nenshi there's nothing wrong with asking, you might just find some of the people you talk with are utter dolts.
@CanadaGoneKiwi Oh noes!! I fully support night owl-ness and encourage you to keep it aliiive. #wootwoot
So question I've been wondering. At Safeway, at the self check-outs, when you go to pay, why is the dollar bill icon blurred out? #seriously

@oakenwork snakes are just freaky in general... their bodies/slithering/hiding in the grass/eating eggs. I've yet to meet a friendly one...
@AlbertaatNoon All drugs? No. Marijuana- sure. Legal pharmaceuticals and alcohol are by far more widely abused/harmful to society than pot.
Also hissing geese are terrifying.
Why are rats so repulsive yet squirrels cute?
Now this scenic drive through rush hour in Calgary is much more tolerable, thank you @HousesMusic

Have you tried the new water, H2OMG? So good, you'll forget it's good for you. #thankstoalloursponsors
@CrystalMully technicalities! That was motivation for the others.I am merely a vessel of the motivational messages... Like Jesus, or whoever
I'd like to go back in time to when my greatest challenge was learning to tell the time on a clock, or tie my own shoelaces. #nostalgia
Onwards and upwards... or whatever. Just go somewhere that appears to be in a forward direction. #motivationaltweeting
A discussion we need to be having re: Canada's Oil Sands Industry via G&amp;M 
New bathroom art. Darwin and his finches! 
True fact: Calgary is charming in the rain. Also, 60% less douchy types hanging around the patios of 17th ave.
I can't be the only one who wants to stay up and party! No wait, I am. God dammit. Ok it's 1:45am, fair enough.
So many previews for movies about the end of the world. That and monsters, and pirate cowboys. So magical!
@oakenwork Right, right. We don't have a basketball team here for obvious reasons... but you're always welcome to come watch some horses die
What do the magnets on our fridges say about us? and does anyone have any serious fridge magnets? #moo 
@oakenwork lol five star tweet sir. How's TO these days? Planning your trip here for Stampede? Yeeeeeeehaw
Tomorrow's forecast: Cloudy with a chance of spaghetti. Probably no meatballs, though. #meteorfoodology
Really crowded at the movies tonight... Crazy! We'll see if the Great Gatsby is as great as it's great title greatly greats, in movie form.
Almost had my first ever successful Ikea trip... Only brought home the wrong table top. #doh
@metromorning Calling anything printed in the Sun 'smart' is a bold statement. A great discussion nonetheless.
Saturday morning coffee with some strawberries, a croissant, and some Cat Power. Add some sunshine and a depressing Yates novel. #perfection
Glass soya sauce containers are not a great idea. Inevitably, they will smash creating a sticky/shardy mess. Bad soya sauce, bad.
Heading home soon! #daysofffffff
How about some great cdn music?
@Crockatteer would you stand up against c-60 threatening the CBC? 
I am trying to sleep, but questions remain unanswered... Why is my bacon mauve? Also, is it FDA approved as a 'Safe to eat keyboard treat'?
Blue is my favourite colour. No, wait, green is my favourite. No, I was wrong, it was blue all along. Blue or mauve... #MauveBaconTyping
It's kind of cool putting a scale in your bathroom, then when you have guests over, they can picture you naked, weighing yourself.

I'm coming to bang on your doors and windows tonight at 11pm to say "good night" ;)
All of the people who insist on saying "good morning" before 6am... I know you do this to torture me. It's not good, it's f-ing early.
Brb, gotta go watch the rest of #AD season four.
@CanadaGoneKiwi Armstrong Moving? Love the name. Yet would also love if the movers had scrawny little arms, and they were all "look- irony!"
Did anyone ever stop to wonder why we all became so dependent on being so in touch with each other? Was this always a thing?
It's a song about icebergs... and it's amazing.

@oakenwork haha sounds good. Lots of long days lately starting up a new plant. Lots of stray electrons and such.
How shocking! @CBCNews: Duffy campaign invoice contradicts expense claim

Not the construction site that closed off 4th three or four times this year, I'm talking the crane at the site that's been up for two years
Yes, the vertical blinds do go well with the deck, and the telephone pole in our alleyway. Also, that crane at the construction site on 4th.
I was hoping that a story beginning with, "so yeah me and my girl had some problems last night..." would somehow be some sort of #yyc romcom
I guess buying drinks from the liquor store on 11 ave is an open invitation for street ppl to tell a story that ends with u giving them $

New keyboard idea: keys are replaced with cats which compose long-winded emails to acquaintances on your behalf, so long as you pet them.
Tripping on your own shoe laces because you're too cool to bend over and re-tie them when they come undone. #notcoolman
@604jimmy nice Jim
Take me down, 6 underground... the ground beneath your feet...  #90sradiotaperecordingsnostalgia
I like the vibe of this. 
@604jimmy wow excellent! Try not to stain your clothes... 
@604jimmy when are you heading? Have a fun trip!
A house without a wi-fi signal is like a Tim Hortons that closes at 11pm. Or something equally inconvenient.
The 'tap and pay' thing leaves me with regret, because I robotically slide my card into the chip reader, and forfeit my opportunity to tap.
I think someone should invent a new colour of traffic light... #justbecause
ack. I am so tired of moving furniture/putting up plastic sheets/sanding/painting/moving furniture/sanding/painting/etc. #renos
@CBCTheSignal - Now if you'll excuse me, I'll just be to riding my 10 speed into outer space... 
Also, this entire thing. 
Great album art, great music. 
@albertaballet great show tonight! #celebratingmozart was excellent. bravo
I really do enjoy riding the C-Train home on a Friday night and watching a domestic dispute on public transit. #yeehaw
Yes #yyc, I am the guy who regretfully wore jeans and a plaid t-shirt to the ballet this evening. #underdressed
@CBCNews why all the lists? I feel like I'm reading buzzfeed or cracked instead of high quality news articles...
@bazookatuka That pile-up was something else dude, completely yardy.  In comes the meat wagon- new guy's in the corner puking his guts out. 
Roads report: #suckage. See you tonight Calgary, much later tonight.
Call one eight-hundred, two six seven, two-thousand and one! #getthefuckouttamyheadplz
Inner city children of promise, but without the necessary means for a necessary means for a higher education. #donttouchthat
@604jimmy #phobichnga?
#yeesh we are a province of morons. 
@gennyloves nice post! It makes me happy when people stand their ground and we inch further away from idiocracy.
Just kidding, it's not really that important. It's actually not important... at all... #bridgewaterwaterbridge
Bridge, bridge, water water, bridge. Water, then bridge, then bridge again... Followed by water and lastly bridge. #important
A tireless car is a driverless car. Unless it's 2050, then it's probably just a car. But then cars with wheels will be redneck... #hmm

Books with multiple grammar fuck-ups make me wonder if i I'm somehow the first person reading the book... (missed words/double words/etc)
&amp; if I had your gift with words, I'd shut this silence down for good...
Me today in -20 weather :P 
Really getting the #Koyaanisqatsi vibe from Rhye - Woman. Cool in a Philip Glass way? Track 10 - 
May may may may may may may as we-e-ell-ell just be me.

I sometimes wonder about wonderful things, while pondering ponds in a waking dream. Also, I drink too.
@gennyloves ahh yes, a girl with green water. Aussi, une garcon avec le grande chapeau d'Abraham Lincoln et trois champaignes boites. #bieno
Enjoying an 'early' Monday morning with Songbirds on @CJSW #yeppers
Brasstronaut is rocking @theCommunitea in Canmore... trumpet in one hand and xylophone in the other #happyears 
@CanadaGoneKiwi ya huh! The thing I probably regret most about life is growing up.
In other news, it's wtf o'clock and you're late for everything today because the sun is a piece of crap. #happydst
Sunday something something. Oh, excuse me... just working on the lyrics for a new song. Sunday something Sunday- yes even better.
Any bums reading twitter tonight, I left a 6-pack of empty beer bottles in my back alley on 19th ave... a short stroll from 17th #urwelcome
I fed a fat squirrel some almonds too. He was giving me the puppy dog eyes from the balcony. I support his lifestyle choices.
I also overheard today that Home Depot will replace your jeans if the ass gets ripped during your shift. It's in their CYA policy, I imagine
Blinds are atrociously expensive. Also, six hours is probably not enough time to spend shopping for them on your Saturday. #wwMSd
Michael Moss on the Current this week, talking about Salt, Sugar, Fat... 
@CJSW Brasstronaut tonight @hificlub and Sunday @Communitea =)
@oakenwork yes sir #Portlandia indeed. Also, "Shave those sideburns, Mattingly!" 
@oakenwork yeah should be some fun times. I look forward to watching them play the Portland Thinkers. We should do a #skydome trip
Remembered my towel, but forget my ipod... Going to be a long run. Long in a terrible, musicless fashion. #gymfail
Can't wait for the whole album! @pitchforkmedia: Listen to another new @jamesblake track, "Digital Lion" 
Data Romance - Cargo 
The real symbol of Calgary? A jean cowboy hat, studded in rhinestones, made from the Wranglers that used to be on Ralph Kleins ass. #yyc
Pencil sharpening nearing diamond like precision point... just one more tiny tu-- *SNAP* #someonepleasefixthis
Floppy floppy floppy ears... you're my floppy ears floppy drive floppy flip floppin flopper. FLOPPPPP! #wordsilove
@oakenwork that + Siri = awesomely creepy
And one day, you wake up to find that the cool Beetlejuice looking lamps you picked out have murdered your family. 
Saturday's time change would be much easier if I had an iwatch #saidnobodyever
then in April, you can go back to walking.
Someone should march anytime they need to get somewhere. Then if someone is like wtf is wrong with you? You just keep marching away #March
Microsoft Sam says, "The next train will arrive in 3 minutes." And then you feel better about life because he sounds more depressed than you
@CJSW Sweet! gonna have to go with @respektor... who else could pull this off 
immune system on strike this week... anyone available to legislate it back to work @cpc_hq?

Just woke up from a nightmare where I murdered my gf's sister. #wheeeeew Alright, off to work I go.
@CanadaGoneKiwi it was just a couple of Jagerbombs... and he had ID #satnightfun
@oakenwork Not sure. Pink eye perhaps, altho it doesn't seem like pink eye... I'll let you know if I do end up blind and we can sue someone.
I spy with my little eye... Nothing because it's all swollen and hurts to open #awesome
Yes!! RT @pitchforkmedia: Listen to Untogether, the new album from Blue Hawaii (@trubluhawaii), via Pitchfork Advance 
The science of junk food... 
Yummy, yummy dinner at Cafe Koi tonight... #tastytreats
Mwahahaha. (installing Snow Leopard onto my crappy old laptop) #genius 
New Junip!

Dazed and confused after a wonderful two hour nap. #hibernation
Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down - We The Common... #great
@thegarypowers agreed... How do you feel about the r3 30? They seem to explore a better variety. (still don't touch what CJSW covers tho)
Hidden YouTube gems: Chim-chim-cher-ee fail edition. Dick slips in soot and falls down the on-set 1960s chiminey, injuring his left pelvis.
Why count to ten when you can stop at a nice, even 9? #funwithnumbers
You'd also think it would be respectable to give up certain letters of the alphabet for the sake of brevity, only it just trns u in2 a hick
Also, are reversable socks a thing? I feel the years of my life wasting away trying to unroll socks and then reverse them...
I still prefer good, old-fashioned soap in bar form, despite the terrible break in period when it is hard and awkward to handle.
@CanadaGoneKiwi how does the Deerfoot look?
Craziness! RT @CBCAlerts: Falling meteor in Russia injures over 400 people . Most injuries caused by shattered glass #russia #meteor
haha yesss! #valentines 
Happy Valentines Day! 
Also, I take great pleasure in finding the heaviest $4.99 cheese. #Safeway #ocd
"Where are the raisins?"    Craisins?    "No, raisins"    Oh, raisins... beside the Craisins. #Safeway
#fundies 
I saw one of these on McLeod Trail on the weekend... 
New James Blake in April... sweeeeet! 
WHATTTT Pancake Tuesday was TODAY?!?!?! #missedthedamnedthing

Does this still work? #BellLetsTalk 5 cents?
Also, awesome music coming to #Communitea 
So, so good #yolatengo 
@604jimmy would had been?
@oakenwork yeah I'm working on some stuff... Interesting, fun stuff. What are you listening to these days?
@thegarypowers nice Stuart McLean sir. My fave Vinyl Cafe was the one with the story where nothing interesting happens. Aka every episode.
Beautiful Monday morning in #yyc! love it.
A hungover day at the gym is better than a sober day on the couch... Maybe...
A special mention to my #gf for taking out the garbage when I was too drunk to do so at 12:37am
@604jimmy jim *clap clap* lets go!
#drunk Joys of being a light-weight!
@gennyloves mm wetfood cake! Save me a piece?
Hey #yyc where is the party at tonight? Drinks at the #KensingtonPub sounds like a good start for me. #buzz
Wth just happened!? RT @yuppielove: The sun was shining literally 5 minutes ago. Blizzard in #yyc. 
@canadagonekiwi excellent! I find it's much more enjoyable than fb. Also, @oakenwork is here. #thankstoallofoursponers
@oakenwork yes @HULKMAYOR is one of TOs treasures. Harper just enjoys the tight Wranglers, leather western vests and big old cowboy hats...
@oakenwork thank you sir, I played the Michael Jackson cover especial para usted
@oakenwork ha ha Bon Jovi and Nickelback is world music in Africa
@oakenwork yet you still elected Mr. Ford #huthuthut-splat
@oakenwork yeah man 
Happy to be hosting Speaking In Tongues on CJSW in just about an hour! Going to be lots of great world music today... super excited!
Totally the day of Mike today... I arrived at the U of C parking lot just in time for the #bestspotevar! #donthavetowalk644346794steps
Yummy! "@lindsayhamel: Vegan pumpkin coconut cinnamon muffin for breakfast, courtesy of @thatgriffingirl 
Picked up RATM cd this morning for $5... My 90s self feels happy again. #MOTHAFUCKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
New Blue Hawaii comes out soon... Love this track! Can't wait. 
Does YOUR town have billboards advertising farm equipment? It would if you lived in #Airdrie...
Kids eat free at Big Diddles Burgers in Didsbury every second Monday from 6pm-7pm! #jk there hasn't really been much charm to report lately
My favourite part of Red Deer? This wonderful, charming neighborhood known as Gasoline Alley. (Giant red neon windmill ftw!) #thedonutcafe
Oh, the white-winged dove... I always thought it was the one-winged dove. This makes much more sense. #smrt
St.Albert... The patron saint of Future Shop, Home Depot, Tim Hortons, Shoppers Drug Mart, Liquor Barn, and Walmart! #abcharm
@gennyloves Yes, a choo-choo of stupidity indeed. Calgary Public Transit needs some cat buses. 
Alberta is known for charming, rural towns... Towns where the main street has a Pizza Hut that's now a busy liquor store. #Athabasca
Well well well Mr. Fog... This is going to be a looooooong drive back to #yyc. Looks like you've won this round #crudgratulations
Also, it seems like hold music has somehow lost its charm... That terrible cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha, ch-ch-cha ch-ch-ch-cha? #crap
I'll get out of the fking jello tree when I'm good and ready, despite your persistent taunts.
"Am I really a morning person, or is it just the Cheerios working their magic?"
Yes, I can throw them over my shoulder like a continental soldier. Thanks for asking.
@KarlaA ...
The NYer takes a decent look at the phenomenon that is Dr. Oz... Interesting comments on health as entertainment 
This has #ikeamonkey written all over it... 
Saturday morning coffee!!!1 #letsdothisthing
Kinda pissed I missed her at Communitea, maybe next time. 
Waiting for the new Young Galaxy album, this one's nicely chilled. (Who wouldn't enjoy singing about their pretty boy?) 
I will gladly walk through the forest with you to a wacky looking cave. 
Gahhhh, so depressed. Where's that #xanax prescription when you really need it? Loud music will need to do.
Whatever happened to walking? Sweet four part series from last year... 
I'm liking this chilled/lo-fi vibe, glad it sounds nothing like Bedouin Soundclash =P 
Killer cats! 
Tired, tired. #zzzzz #awardwinningtweet
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. #penis
Seven minutes of Monday night bliss. 
Unsubscribing from useless email alerts #cathartic
That terrible Sunday morning moment you realise it was 1 tsp of baking soda, not 1 tbsp. #fkedpancakes
Chicken steak, chicken steak, who knows what she's gonna make... #Odessa
Yes, yes... you are much too angry for a Saturday night (puts on @theweepies and slowly adjusts the volume up).  #ahhh
Tried to wait until the end of season 2 to catch up on Girls but couldn't hold out... @lenadunham is amazing. Pure genius.
"Bowies new song sounds like it belongs in a porn montage" Agreed.
"you have a much angrier inner monologue than I do..." #shitmygfsays
Smacked the back of my f-ing head on the f-ing breakfast bar that we never f-ing use to eat f-ing breakfast at. #f-ing
Alright I put in a good half hour of constructive work today #naptime
@acnewman Shut Down The Streets is great! Can't get past the first 6 tracks... #strings on repeat forever &amp; ever...
@jianghomeshi how about the silf? 
@lindsayhamel I've been eating berries and hemp hearts for breakfast for the last three years... They are amazing for heart health/cardio!

@oakenwork hey did you hear Hayden has a new release Feb 5 on Arts and Crafts? He's also touring Toronto in Feb. #fyi
"the dishwasher is broken..." No, no, you just loaded 468954335681 cookie sheets into it, along with two weeks worth of dishes #technology
Idc if the movie is getting less than stellar reviews... Surely some theatre in #yyc will carry #ontheroad? 
#twitter...all kinds of #failwhale today =/  is someone still recovering from the weekend? Catch a cold? #getwellsoon
So, survived #bluemonday feeling relatively happy... Can I get a rain check and save my day of depression for sometime later this year?
@gennyloves great show this am... Would be sweet to check out Paige Leigh Tyson live. #yyctalent
@oakenwork but look on the bright side, he still has a successful career as a future politician... #doprah
@gennyloves Excellent! Yummy pasta is yummy. #Wine too?
@CBCTheSignal Ahh definitely Beach House's Bloom... Her voice and the guitar are magical. 
So tired...Gah it's only 6:30pm? #chronicfatigue
Chris Ware's Building Stories... A beautiful, amazingly depressing graphic novel installation! 
Blow ye winds, like the trumpet blows, but without that noise. #deepthoughts
I hate to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies... #90s
#creepyclown 
@gennyloves Girls is amazing. And so is wine. The coasters look pretty badass too... but are they Portuguese?
@broniewyn @CBC_Music and "You Let Me Down" by Mr. Joel Plaskett is wicked.
@broniewyn @CBC_Music Luke Doucet "It's Not the Liquor I Miss" is a good "broken up/what to do now" tune...
Laying in bed reading On the Road... thinking of skipping the gym and anything else that requires leaving my bed today #productivity
@lindsayhamel nice! I will have to stream radio 1 central tomorrow when I wake up. #505050 in February?
Yay! So nice to hear @CBCTheSignal Laurie Brown early today =) Working Christmas day isn't so bad after all... #ChristmasMiracle

Enjoying my flight home in our tiny plane #barrenwasteland #tgifd #yeg-yyc 
@ifcportlandia love the show, it's hilarious. We visited after watching this summer and it's spot on with the city vibe.
Now I just have to figure out why all of these naked women are following me... #awkward
Ha alright ok @oakenwork, I think I finally understand twitter. #imback
Tweet tweet... #iamstillalive
Mom that pidgeon on top of the apartment building across the road is staring at me again!
sunny summer sunday- syrup saturated silverware/saucers sitting sink side, sunlight slowly showing shiny sanitized surfaces...
If that goose comes any closer, I will shoot it in the neck. With my handgun. From my balcony. On 26th ave SW.
I am a fat person living in a skinny mans body.
