$6 to print your bank statements?  Wtf Chase Bank!
Its easier said than done and can fall into it if not careful.
I try not to judge because that always misleads you.
Its the fear of someone taking away or the envy of what other people have that makes us fight instead of helping each other
I love that my presence alone makes other men angry and intimidated. Scared little boys that never grew up, that's all I see
Slow ass day, nothing out there but I still got to make money
Oh well just being real
She has an juicy ass but I didn't noticed that until she walked away. Was too focused on her ears lol
Things like that I notice on people
This other girl I know has the most beautifully shaped ears
Dirty talk is always the best when she's also in tune with you
As long as the energy is right on
I don't try and fuck things up either
I always have a connection with someone in those age groups
Young, old or the same age as me
I do have a thing for older women
I need to release some stress at some point soon. Its been a while
Just my way of showing how grateful I am to ever met her ;)
Even if nothing ever happens sexually with her, I am still going to help her out. She offered to help me out when I was at my darkest
I'm just trying to help out along the way
I always meet the ones that are fascinated with me
I love this connection
I was scared to death to say anything when I first met her.
I don't seek them out, they all find me
My bad for listening to her when she talks and caring
She always was so comfortable around me and always shared her thoughts. Something her husband didn't like!
A charge is felt when 2 people's spirits are sync
God her eyes could stop me
Eat her out until she gushes
Dirty thoughts throughout my mind lol
The one from my old place, she was so sexy and was more than happy to see me.
I just want to eat my neighbor out.
Engulfing into some fantasies
Its hard to stay on your feet while going through obstacles
So damn hungry right now
I really hate having slow reception.
