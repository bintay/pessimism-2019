Could @DavidLammy become the UK's first BME party leader? And PM? Discussion on BBC News looks like he's thinking of standing...
Feeling withdrawal symptoms from #GE2015 - Don't know what to watch on TV, don't know what to start conversations (and arguments) about!
@PressTV @TehranMunicipal Looks amazing - wish I could be there! :)

@TehranMunicipal replaces 1500 ad billboards with artworks for ten days. 
So it's an outright Conservative majority?! Better than the Tories had hoped for and worse than Labour's worst fears. #GE2015
Sorry to see Vince Cable &amp; Charles Kennedy loose their seats. Both seemed like decent blokes &amp;sensible coalition partners #GE2015

Phew! My namesake Ben Walker, UKIP candidate in my home constituency in Bristol didn't win. So I don't need to change my name after all! :)
Warm welcome to new MP @NazShahBfd: a wealth of life experience &amp;community engagement which is desperately needed in Westminster #GE02015
Very sad tht @georgegalloway lost his seat. One of the mst principled politicians in my lifetime and true anti-war champion @ukrespectparty
@Tom_Sharman I was always optimistic. If votes were correlated to how happy candidates looked in their Twitter photo tho, you'd have won!
Sad that my old university mucker @Tom_Sharman didn't get elected for @TheGreenParty in #Ealing Central :( Labour take seat from Tories
Better best forgotten!

@DaraDeBrun @Salma1084 He turned a much-needed debate abt a serious issue into a platform for Islamophobic fantasy. :( #bbcqt
@gazaboatconvoy Though remember not all Muslims are "visible" ;)

@LBC It's the first time in as long as I can remember that I've agreed with Blair. For once he speaks the truth.

Big #FF @SayeedaWarsi &amp; @thecitycircle for such a good-humoured discussion last night #CCWarsi 
@ayeshamian Fair enough - it's just different styles of interviewing ;)
@ayeshamian True!! But I did think that Rashid extracted a lot out of her - maybe more than if she'd answered everything at her own pace
@ayeshamian But isn't that the point of an interviewer - to challenge the interviewee and prevent a monologue?
@rumanhasanx Ha ha ha!
The hottest political discussion this evening isn't #BBCQT – it's with @theCityCircle &amp; @SayeedaWarsi 
An Evening wth @SayeedaWarsi - This Thurs - venue now confirmed

@LPHR_Lawyers Thanks for organising and demonstrating the impt role lawyers &amp;activists can play fighting for justice #GazaJustice
@AhlulbaytTV This Eid overshadowed by horrific violence and suffering in Syria :( Remember Syria in Eid duas
The ICC can't investigate war crimes unless/until Israel or Palestine join ICC
Israel does not have a system in place to conduct effective &amp;professional investigations of itself. @d_machover #GazaJustice
Palestinians wishing to pursue legal claims agst Israel have to pay court fees of £5-6000. No access to justice! #GazaJustice
This eve's @LPHR_Lawyers talk on the rule of law in #Gaza abt to start. Speakers inc @d_machover #GazaJustice 
Looking forward to tonight's @LPHR_Lawyers talk "The rule of law, accountability and #Gaza" #Palestine
#EidMubarak to everybody celebrating today - May you have a joyful and peaceful Eid :) &lt;3
The mindless murder of aid worker Alan Hemming in Syria leaves no doubt about the depravity of ISIS.
Thank you @ChambersGuides for informative presentation abt this year's submission process. Now the hard work begins! 
@LBC A Tory-UKIP alliance might help Labour win, as Tory voters who don't like UKIP's racist undertones vote for anybody else.
BREAKING: Police using tear gas &amp; pepper spray against pro-democracy protesters in #HongKong
@MFrancoisCerrah Very worrying indeed. Of course, could never happen here. #FamousLastWords
@RefugeeAction Agree wth yr resettlement worker &amp; @Welcome2Newy: nice 2B reminded tht UK communities DO have a history of welcoming migrants
For the 3rd time in my life my govt is abt to bomb Iraq. Aim to defeat IS may be laudable but track record of outcomes has been disastrous
@SqueakinglyJen Ha ha ha!
Heartened to see UK &amp; #Iran leaders sitting down in direct dialogue for first time since I was born

78% of voters think criminal trials should not be televised #bbcsml
@SheldonB14 Ratings :)
@SheldonB14 But Sky already does have the contract to broadcast proceedings from the UK Supreme Court (free to view of course)
Televising trials may deter witnesses from giving evidence. Or might motivate witnesses seeking a media career. #bbcsml
Should UK criminal trials be televised? Debate now on BBC1 #bbcsml
"Difficult to imagine that any religion would sanction the beheading of a humanitarian worker" Watching #bbcsml on BBC1
@wainwright_tom There's only 1 solution: Our Snr Clerk is a football coach - I'll ask him to arrange a hardcore training session :)
With headset mics and audience screaming &amp;cheering the Scotland Decides debate is like the pop concert of the referendum #indyref

Looking fwd to tonight's discussion "#Gaza: A legal analysis &amp; response" @thecitycircle

@Selig8888 @LBC @CST_UK As soon as I saw the pic on Twitter it said "Nazi" to me - before I'd read the Tweet or heard the story.
@LBC I'm shocked and speechless. How on Earth did somebody think it was a good idea. Completely unacceptable. @CST_UK
LIVE: @AhlulbaytTV (a channel largely watched by Asians) is asking difficult q'n: Do Asian men prey on white girls? Brave topic to tackle
"The weak people of #Gaza have achieved victory from Israel" 
@LBC Whatever the dangers for children in England, they're nothing compared with the dangers for children in #Gaza
@Farah_Gazan I can't really comprehend the sense of relief and joy you must be feeling. Overjoyed for #Gaza
Overjoyed at news tonight that peace has come to #Gaza! &lt;3 But could weep for the 2138 pple (inc 490 children) there who were killed :(
Interesting art on how webforum is connecting #humanrights lawyers @altlawforum in India 
@LBC But it could be slippery slope to withdrawing free treatment. Best to treat first, ask q'ns/issue invoice later
@LBC Yes in principle - not the tax payer's responsibility to pay for other people's irresponsible behaviour  1/2
"Thanks For Your Job Offer, but No Thanks" Why candidates turn down offers. By @MarathonBrian 
@Zee_Gaza Hopefully not - even if BBC &amp; CNN have moved on, your Twitter followers are still anxious abt what's going on there!

"Liberal" would imply some respect for, eg, the right to life and supporting non-violent direct action 
How Hadley Freeman can call herself "liberal" while spewing 919 words implying we're all antisemites for boycotting Israel baffles me 1/2
Honoured &amp;flattered that my tweets frm #GazA9 demo worthy of trolling. OK, @rjfree1998 is a nobody from Alaska but gotta start somewhere!
The main #GazA9 demonstration may be over but there's only one word outside M&amp;S Oxfor St: BOYCOTT! #Gaza

@brisofa Yes-this sort of wanton violence and enjoyment of inflicting suffering are always the antecedents of genocide. #Gaza #No2ISIS
@brisofa Absolutely repulsive woman. The zionist PR machine are apologists for human suffering - she actaully seems to be enjoying it :((
@SayeedaWarsi History will remember you as somebody who sacrificed their career for their principles. Not enough like you in politics.
SOS call: National Demonstration for #Gaza TOMORROW London. No excuses. Be there 
@LBC We don't ban the Nazi flag (per se) or the flags of genocidal states like Sudan &amp;Israel. Would be a strange place to start.
I know it's not Friday but #FF &amp; massive respect @SayeedaWarsi for resigning over UK gov's lamentable policy on #Gaza
@Zee_Gaza I would say "sleep well". If only that were possible :( Thanks for your insightful Tweets - keeping the world informed abt #Gaza
@LBC @DuncanBarkes Careful wth yr phrasing @onewhosees1: tht cud be taken as anti-semitic. NEway,govt imposes asset freezes/banking santions
@LBC @DuncanBarkes Post cease-fire: collect evidence of alleged crimes, and if there is enough evidence to prosecute send Israeli PM to ICC
@LBC @DuncanBarkes Immediate response: suspend all arms exports, freeze bank a/c's &amp; impose travel bans on Israeli government personnel 1/2
@Zee_Gaza This is 1 of the mst sickening things 2come out of the whole conflict. Only thing worse thn agression is enjoying inflicting pain
@paulakahumbu No matter how idiotic that sounds, it just goes to show that good sex education can't be left to chance

No wonder our PM isn't condemning #Gaza attacks: he's cosy wth "Conservative Friends of #Israel"

No excuses. Be there #Gaza9

Sainsburys High St Ken shut off. Still trading but no customers allowed in/out. Boycott Israeli goods! 
Anti-war demo retains a family friendly atmosphere - even after some of the younger protestors' bedtimes :) 
Do you have anybody on High St Ken @PressTV? Anti-war demo for #Gaza going strong.
I've just been shoved into the crowd by the police. Shame. Up until now they've been as peaceful as we have. #Gaza

@Saira1Ummah @MFrancoisCerrah I know - says what everyone else was already thinking.
@AJHeadtoHead I wud say no as Zionism is premised on colonialism &amp; advancing one ethno-religious grp over anothr. But I'll watch B4 judging
Who really speaks for British Muslims @MFrancoisCerrah's article is bold, brilliant &amp; brave 
"Third of Britons are cancelling nights out to catch up on sleep" @TravelodgeUK survey. Literally LOL'ing HT @magicFM
Sad to hear that Lister-Petter where I did my Year in Industry &amp; got my first taste for business is in administration 
@IsabelHardman His position in the community would be untenable, especially in a constituency with a large Muslim population.
I've said it before and I'll say it again: the UK's under-commitment to assisting refugees is a disgrace @UNHCRUK


@HassanRouhani Hoping that 1393 brings prosperity and security for Iran and Iranians - Inshallah!
@JohnWJenkins @R_McCormack @MFrancoisCerrah Ha ha ha! Or "Who represents LGBT pple" with someone who was "cured" of being gay as a panellist
@MFrancoisCerrah Oh it could have been worse - at least we didn't get Anjem Choudary being held up as a "Muslim leader"...
@MoAnsar @MFrancoisCerrah Well said Mo :)
Well done @mehdirhasan for exposing live on @BBCNewnight that they had dropped the only female panellist from their "Muslims" debate
Well said @MFrancoisCerrah That was a disgusting slur and @Faysal_FreeGaza should be ashamed. @mehdirhasan @MaajidNawaz
@MFrancoisCerrah So an all-male panel? While I respect @MoAnsar @MaajidNawaz &amp; @mehdirhasan wud have liked female perspective :S
@yvonneridley Where are you flying to?
Very sorry to read statement from @MAS "We have to assume that #MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean" 
@NegarMortazavi @Farnaz_92 Ahh ziba! :) Nowruz mobarak!
@mehdirhasan @TariqRamadan Sounds great! Will be sure to watch it!
"When retirement has ended": Ed Balls's very British euphemism for death. H/T @BBCquestiontime
#NowruzMobarak! سال نو همگی مبارک! A very happy new year to all my Persian and Iranian friends. Best wishes for 1393! :)
Damn! I missed @RefugeeAction's online Q&amp;A 2day abt the #Immigration Bill. Time 2grab a cuppa &amp;catch up 
@Nadia193 Oooo! Congratulations - Mashallah :)
@Nadia193 What's the excitement about?!
Just watched Martin McGuinness speaking to @mehdirhasan on terrorists, freedom fighters &amp;path to peace. 
Missing @MAS plane 'deliberately diverted' 
@paullewismoney How the hell are single people, lone parents, widows etc supposed to afford that?! :O

Countries who have pledged to offer resettlement to #Syria'n #refugees 
@UNHCRUK It's pretty disappointing that the UK government won't do more.
Very sad to hear of passing of #TonyBenn. A principled politician and fighter against his own party's war in Iraq. #TonyBennRIP

@LaurenBoothUK That site's creater is a former adviser to Netanyahu!

@mehdirhasan Congratulations - no need to be humbled - well deserved!

After a hard day's work @gardencourtlaw I'm heading home to watch #Silk. Wonder if they've introduced a #Marketing manager this series...

@deliavenables Lawyers who are very clued up on their particular area of law will have several things to say each day! :)
@deliavenables Nothing wrong wth several Tweets/day. Esp if reporting/commenting on a live event/developing news story.
2/2 Find out why @RefugeeAction are taking them to court 
1/2 Could you live on just £5/day? I couldn't. Yet that's all the UK govt is giving #refugees to survive on. #asylumsupport
@bbcbigquestions Yes (well, morally: certainly.) Yes. No. But I'll still tune in to hear others' views :)
The dilemma we all have at 22:40 on a Thurs evening: watch #bbcqt or Sky+ it and get an early night
@EstherPilger Telling a barrister what a deadline means is no mean feat - best of luck with that! @_lesliethomas @mwillers1
Very pleased and proud of colleagues @_lesliethomas and my #marketing convenor @mwillers1 on being appointed as silks. Many congrats!
@fatimamanji @MFrancoisCerrah I wish it *had* been photoshoped. For me it only feels marginally better than "blacking-up"
@yvonneridley Can't work out if "Birder" was a typo or impression of a Scottish accent :)
I didn't know Central African Republic has a female president. Watch Catherine Samba-Panza interview @AJEnglish  
@yvonneridley Did you report it to anybody? You must!
@brisofa @thecitycircle It was a fascinating talk and offered a lot of insight. Thank you for organising!
Should assisted dying be legal?

@adamdeen @bbcbigquestions Secularists are those who want to seperate religious and state institutions. Pple who bully are just haters
There is a difference between saying something funny and going out to be gratuitously offensive. #BBCTBQ Couldn't say it better myself :)
Khola Hasan "If hunters care so much about conservation, why don't they just give the cash" rthr than buy licences to hunt? #BBCTBQ
Completely aghast at a hunter advocating in favour of trophy hunting in Africa on the grounds of the "elation" he feels :O #BBQTBC
Time for The Big Questions: it time for Vatican 2 confess? Is trophy hunting good 4conservation? Are some topics too sacred 4humour? #BBCTBQ
Do you know a doctor/healthcare professional? Could they train 2 help ppl in immigration detention?  
As #tubestrike causes rush hour chaos, Bob Crow's popularity soars to marginally below that of a foot and mouth outbreak
@BBCLondon949 Yes. I support employees' rights to go on strike. I wud also welcome employers' rights to dismiss those who strike.
Londoners unite in wartime-like sense of defiance &amp; camaraderie in the face of the #tubestrike
@RefugeeAction It still beggars belief that some think we shld prioritise asylum cases on religious affinity rather than humanitarian need
@RefugeeAction Thx - watched last night :)
"The sol'n 2 religious discrimination in Syria is not to discriminate religiously in UK" Watching #BBCTBQ on prioritising refugees frm Syria
@WasHasNaz Any particular reason why?
Trying to avoid laughing at HFW's mispronunciation of Swedish words: "systembolaget" pronounced short "a" is just wrong Ha ha! #Scandimania
Sad side of Swedish society is immigrants &amp;those of non-Nordic descent feel they don't belong &amp;experience racism :( #Scandimania
Watching #Scandimania on @Channel4 - it's making me miss Sweden!
Really disappointed I missed pt1 of #BBCTBQ on UK prioritising Syrian Christians for asylum, wth Dave Garratt @RefugeeAction.One for iPlayer
Thank you @vickybeeching for revealing the shocking truth that women choose to keep #hijab as an expression of #feminism. :)
Next up on #BBCTBQ, should women dress modesty? But shouldn't us men folk too?
Fascinating discussion on #BBCTBQ about whole-life tariffs. Wonder if Pete Weatherby @gcnchambers &amp; @MayaSikand are watching

@GershomG Excellently written: important to remember many Israelis were ashamed of what Sharon did in their name. Thx 4 sharing @SalmaYaqoob

@LukeAFarley That's a shame. #BBCTBQ covered difficult topics wth tremendous dignity &amp; respect. Pity you needed to deviate :(
@LukeAFarley No I'm upholding Art 9 ECHR to the letter: freedm 2practise only 2B restricted in interest of safety etc 
@LukeAFarley BTW the judge found a compromise which cost nobody anything &amp;maintained everyone's dignity Worth reading:
@LukeAFarley Well it sounds an unnecessarily pejorative and disrespectful term. Please clarify that's not what you intended?
@LukeAFarley Again, if those are yr profoundly held beliefs then I'd support yr right to do so. But you're being facetious so its irrelevant
@LukeAFarley Not sure who "the religionists" are but if you refer to bishops in HoL then mst pple I know would abolish, whatever their faith
@LukeAFarley If you can demonstrate these are sincerely held beliefs, and that there's no risk to public then I'd fully support you :)
@LukeAFarley True it's qualified if it wud conflict wth H&amp;S/public order etc. Nobody's suggesting religion should enjoy privilage over othrs

Thanks @bbcbigquestions for a fascinating debate on #HumanRights and #Belief - that hour went VERY quickly! #BBCTBQ

"Banning the face veil will marginalise me as a British citizen &amp;confine me to the home" @SaharAlFaifi #BBCTBQ
@LukeAFarley Not exactly: Article 9 ECHR guarantees freedom of belief, including right to practice and manifest that belief :)
2/2 Art 10 (freedom of expression) &amp; 14 (prohibition of discrimination) #BBCTBQ #HumanRights #Belief
1/2 My predictions for the discussion are how do we reconcile Art 9 Rights (freedom of belief) with Art 8 (right to private/family life)
Making breakfast ready to see @bbcbigquestions Special: "Should #humanrights always outweigh religious rights?" #BBCTBQ at 10:00

Packing up my walking gear for today's London #LegalWalk to raise money for law centres - will the rain hold off?! #LLST
@AhlulbaytTV The only reason it might be offensive would be because it's being hijacked by the #EDL &amp;far right groups
@nadiabaksh It means that they thought "Minister for fags and booze" didn't sound quite right.
@wainwright_tom Here here!!
1 wk left to apply for #Marketing Assistant role @gardencourtlaw 
@justinmoorhouse I thought "because they both have red hair". Then realised you meant the other Fergie.
Sending arms to #Syria has got to be the worst possible course of action: if West arms 1grp Russia will arm another 
Put it this way, I'm glad I'm not the marketing/PR manager @hardwickelaw - that's quite some reputational issue to deal with tomorrow!
What on earth is @BarbaraHewson thinking when she calls for age of consent to be reduced to 13?! 
If you're keen to build a career in #marketing then why not apply at leading #humanrights chambers @gardencourtlaw 
@LPHR_Lawyers Was an excellent session - thank you for organising :)

@LeighDay_Law No worries - will catch up on it when beside a computer ;)
@hrwfilmfestival Watched this at the London film fest: inspiring &amp;eye opening. Leap at the chance to see it Chicago!
Def wouldn't recommend anyone outsourcing writing their value statements though-they have to come from within - in every sense
Interesting (if a bit bland) article on #marketing the Bar frm @barmktg 
@LeighDay_Law Would love to read this but yr cookies disclaimer fills the screen &amp;can't be closed on a Blackberry :(
@dreistreifenz @georgegalloway I'll forgive Labour when they co-operate fully with the ICC and hand Blair over for trial
@UK_HumanRights You're right that there are faultlines in Iranian society, but they're not along gender lines (or no more than in the West)
@UK_HumanRights Come to Iran - I'll show you plenty of women who love the IRI &amp;plenty of men who don't!

Interns aren't the only ones being exploited: some jnr barristers working for less than nothing 
2/2 It's tough enough for young pple starting out in #marketing or other fields as it is without having to work for nothing. #internships
1/2 Glad to see HMRC investigating firms exploiting unpaid #interns. 
My favourite/most unreal #Thatcher quote: "In recent weeks, Marxist agitators &amp;militants have organised mob violence" 
#Page3 has always been an aberrance in what we like to think of as civilised society – glad to see @Girlguiding saying #NoMorePage3
Sad to learn that possibly the greatest peacetime leader ever of the UK has passed away. RIP Margaret #Thatcher
@AhlulbaytTV If we stopped subsidised arms exports masquerading as "aid" we could increase aid AND cut taxes!
Members of the @gardencourtlaw #legalwalk team will be pleased to hear they have me marshalling them on the day. Up 2, 3, 4… @londonlegal

Thx @hrwfilmfestival for screening The Patience Stone. Very thought provoking - underlines why many frm #Afghanistan seek #asylum #HRWLondon
@JenniferAllsopp Having just seen it I'd highly recommend it - search Amazon or suggest to yr local indpt cinema :)
@AhlulbaytTV I can't watch the prog this eve but it would be interesting if you touched on Huzn :)
Off to see the next #humanrights #film from @hrwfilmfestival: The Patience Stone 
@gardencourtlaw I'm certainly hoping to catch a few screenings - looking forward to it!
I don't live in #NewYork or know anything abt #videoediting but for those who do this has got to be a #dreamjob @hrw

For those who couldn't attend, here's the video Alone on child #prisoners in #Palestine from @DCI_Palestine 
Have finally got the last of our @ChambersGuides submissions sent off. Now a lot of hard work for the researchers at their end! #marketing
Thank you Sahar Francis @Addameer_PS &amp; @LPHR_Lawyers for a very informative evening on imprisonment of children in #Palestine
@ArticleOne1979 Good! Until the UK apologises for the crimes of colonialism, it can never come to terms with its dark past. #Amritsar
@WillardFoxton Having to specify basics like "looking towards the camera" and "preferably smiling" says it all...
@WillardFoxton I've just been chasing certain barristers for new and improved photos for their profiles
It may be 93 yrs late but glad to see #Cameron apologising for #Amritsar massacre

Having a cold at the wknd is no fun :( But @Kleenex_UK menthol balm tissues are making it more bearable #CandyForYourNose :)
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv It's 1small step to bringing parity between public &amp; prvt sector T&amp;Cs. Unions resist pension reform so salaries suffer
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv Your willingness to deal with this is highly commendable and the reason we the public have faith in the police ;)
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv Yes I do. Public money can't be used to pay pple danger money in case they are prosecuted and find it "stressful"
@iofiv @LDNThieftaker Of course, that's what they're there for!! :)
@iofiv @LDNThieftaker Commendable, but still need to drive safely!!
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv Very happy that in an open democracy,where criminal allegations arise, we resolve these by jury trial
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv Nobody (inc the police) wud want a "don't prosecute" rule for the police-would diminish public confidence in them
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv Frustrating as it may be, officers' professional duty is to public safety, even if that means ending a chase
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv For reasons of public protection dangerous drivers have to be locked up, warrant card or no warrant card :)
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv   
Suggest you look up legal def of dangerous driving.Clue: it's not an inadvertent transgression 
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv To get sent to prison you hav to hav shown intent/reckless disregard. That's a million miles from smthng "going wrong"
@LDNThieftaker @iofiv For the record nobody goes to prison unless after a full criminal trial they are convicted of an imprisonable offence
Good morning all, sorry I'm late, there was a #helicopter #crash on the way into work. 
@iofiv And in this day and age, "long" is a good thing when it comes to jobs. Though if you can afford to retire at 55, that's short!
@iofiv "moderately desirable"?! Police pensions are worth at least 20times their private sector equivalents at the same salary level
@iofiv   
But salient point is nobody wth self-funded pension (what u can save +/- stckmkt variation) could retire on 1/3of final salary
@iofiv Under UK tax law alone, nobody with a stakeholder pension could do that....
@iofiv Consider it alongside pension "entitlement". To retire in mid-50s wth a final salary pension the rest of us would need to be on £50k+

@DCI_Palestine Colonisers always use violence against indigenous peoples – that's how they manage to set up colonies.
@DCI_Palestine That would imply that violence from illegal settlers was ever under control in the first place.
Tragic killing in #Syria: a @PressTV reporter has been shot dead by a sniper 
2/2 Rmbr: a £1m house in Z1-2 London looks just like a £40k terrace in the Welsh Valleys. If it's a 5-way houseshare, hardly a "tax on rich"
