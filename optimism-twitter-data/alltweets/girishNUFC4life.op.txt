Matchdaaayy @RCBTweets #rcb #MIvRCB #PepsiIPL
Im a horrible person.
@NUFC_KW @NufcAnonymous @nufcfans I don't think Sunderland will be there. They might beat Chelsea IMO.. We ll end with 17th!
What the actual fuck! Ryan Taylor got 3 bonus pts yesterday in FPL?? Are u fuckin kidding me!!!!!!  #NUFC
@bastie35 OMG!!!! REALLY???
Where the hell is Obertan???   #NUFC
@_DomWilson don't think Aarons will start
@mohanstatsman could you tell me when did Kohli miss that match?
Min 50 mts
0 S Raina (125)
1 V Kohli (117)
1 S Warne (55)
3 MSD (122)

That is why British were called Tommi…
Will Newcastle United get relegated after this weekend's results? I voted NO in  @EveningChron poll! Have your say:  
@RnRFootball Moyes!!
I was like what's this #NUFC won Wembley fuzz all about whole day long. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@GeordieLadPaul Cant trust Spurs. They lost to Stoke today 3-0.Unpredictable team. That's why I'm scared. I think mackems might best Chelsea
@Erestyn @NUFC_Stats I think I should agree with you here. Once Aarons and Siem are fit he has to be benched. But sissoko has to start.
I loved Sammy overhead kick. He was good. But he's nothing more than an impact sub. He should not be given new contract. #nufc
@GeordieLadPaul Didn't you watch match, Paul?
@GeordieLadPaul tough but I am optimistic. Its scary. Hull lost to Burnley. Other than this all the fixtures went against us.
@Erestyn @NUFC_Stats True. Sammy shouldn't be given new contract! Sissoko muscles thru that mid and helps Cabella and Ayoze to run forward!
@GeordieLadPaul Ayoze Cisse have to start. Janmaat gives a great boost. Jonas and Ryan were pathetic. Ryan was shite totally. :(
@GeordieLadPaul We were good really. Riviere played well. Ayoze and Cabella wer good n made good runs. Dummett has to be CB. Sliding tackle
@NUFC_Stats don't u understd. Sammy is only an impact sub.Pathetic if he starts. He gets to mak a great impression but he starts he's awful!
@NUFC_Stats what!!!!!! Sissoko shot on target twice earlier. He was an impact player!!!!!
Can't believe I could ever say this. Ryan was pathetic today. Unbelievable performance !!!!!  #NUFC
Cabella has to start. Dummett has to play in CB. Wish Aarons start next game. Cisse and Ayoze have to start. Rivere was good today. #NUFC
A BIG THANK YOU from all the Geordie's to @BurnleyOfficial for beating #HCFC .. We miss you next season!  #NUFC
Still a lot depressed. But still happy for a point. Awful display by Ryan and Jonas though.   #NUFC
@RCBTweets What Nogs Saar. U reply wonly garls ha? Navella weasta ?? angriness is coming from the very very insidu..  #RCBInsider

We are true fans of you Burnley only for today #BFC #NUFC #HCFCvBFC
@Toon_Times We have 50+ supporters on Indian WhatsApp group now.. #nufc
@Toon_Times sure mate. Its tough to say the reasons but its the team I always wanted to support frm childhood but became actual fan recently
@Toon_Times I started supporting because of team spirit, fan base, proper team but no titles from long time. But it just gave me goosebumps
@Toon_Times I knew nufc were prime team but I didn't follow that time because I didn't have cable at home to watch on TV.
@Toon_Times school time I used to watch Adverts on TV with Shearer running with trademark style.
@Toon_Times I need sometime to answer that question. I'm from India n fan from 2012 Mostly due to Shearer even though he wasn't in team1/2
@EveningChron My predictions..  #nufc 
@EveningChron this was awesome!

Everton lads please beat the fuck out of Sunderland #EFC #NUFC

I wish @R_Aarons16 plays for Newcastle this weekend. I do believe he can save us from relegation and Carver like he did for Pardew #nufc
@BenDinnery Hi Ben. Do you think Cisse might feature this weekend? Thoughts on him? #nufc
@lee_ryder as you told you yesterday he might save Carver too if he's featured. Even in big games..

@RCBTweets Why only against #csk!!! I hate this! #rcb
@dcfcoffcial fuck off
@lee_ryder Is lack of options the reason for Carver not getting sacked? #nufclive
@lee_ryder Will Cisse feature in next game? And will there be any change in the formation? #nufclive
@lee_ryder  Any evidence of Krul-Colo burst up? How is the situation like? Will there be change in captaincy in next 3 matches? #nufclive
@lee_ryder  Coloccini still a captain, Carver still head coach, same old back 4. Is anything going to change in next 3 games #nufclive
@lee_ryder Hi Lee. Why isn't Carver getting sacked? What is Ashley's propaganda with him? #nufclive

@lee_ryder Aarons got us 2-3 wins under Pardew. Do you think Aarons will play any part in next 3 matches? Is he still injured?  #nufclive
@MsiDouglas What will happen in case next match is lost with Carver? No changes whatsoever? #nufclive
Is there any evidence in Krul - Collo burst out? Will Coloccini's captaincy be stripped? who will be the new #nufc captain then?   #nufclive
@MsiDouglas @lee_ryder yes yes. Many questions to go
True this!  
@HD_07 Carver. because I don't know what Charnley is blamed for.

@Andy_Swizz66 oh fancy that! I didnt know. But how can he almost get Derby relegated?
@MCFC haha useless club!
@MariacatHarris @lee_ryder @NUFC_Stats I agree on Carver part. But I feel no way in hell a non English manager is coming to us..
@Andy_Swizz66 do u only mean in Championship right? Lol
@Andy_Swizz66 currently I'd love to see any such changes. But it's not or later that we ll get relegated. McClaren is worse than Pardew.

@lee_ryder @MsiDouglas I'm from India and I can assure u I'm as much as frustrated as any #nufc fan. Do you reckon Ashley knows it?#nufclive
@lee_ryder If prime players like Janmaat, Cisse, Sissoko leave can it because of John Carver's method? Any thoughts?  #nufclive
@MsiDouglas Is there any non-English manager who is not in any job who can fit into Ashley's bill and game plan? #nufclive
@lee_ryder Is not Mike Ashley going to talk to the media after all these tiffs? Why aren't the press getting to talk to him? #nufclive
@MsiDouglas How is Lee Charnley being criticized for poor season? Wasn't he responsible for 9 incoming players? #nufc
@MsiDouglas Are there any non English managers who would love to take up head-coach-job at Newcastle knowing the business model? #nufclive
Is Ashley under any pressure from the current crisis? Do u think Ashley will quit considering the fan's interests getting dipped? #nufclive

We #RCB needs an Anil Kumble-type captain. @RCBTweets #ipl #eit20
I repeat... @RCBTweets lacks an inspiring captain. Its clearly seen after I watched my team play live against @ChennaiIPL at Stadium
How is Dinesh Karthik and Harshal Patel playing in 11 and not Mandeep Singh, Badrinath and @maddo53 ? @RCBTweets #RCB #IPL #eit20
@RCBTweets We do need an inspiring captain. Probably @ABdeVilliers17 ... We love @imVkohli but his captaincy is at fault for #RCB
Last 2 seasons has been abysmal for @RCBTweets. I rem when @KP24 was givn captaincy n then changed to @anilkumble1074. We finished 2nd! #rcb
Gayle benched for one poor performance. Poor Mandeep Singh benched for 2 bad performance @RCBTweets. Captains decisions!  #rcb #ipl #eit20
2/2 Startin 11- Replacing Bisla for Mandeep not Dinesh K. Is this because of price tag on @DineshKarthik? @RCBTweets #rcb #ipl #eit20
I seriously feel my team @RCBTweets's faults are at hands of captain. Virat. Has gone wrong in everything this year. Batting order #rcb 1/1
I just went up a level in Soccer Stars! @miniclip

@HD_07 Oh and I really thought Ashley has spoken out on this issue.
@HD_07 Each one Bring one? What's that mean?
Hi Sanjay. Do you think team like RCB has really lost the plot on transfer? They seem to be very bad in all-rounder department. #matchpoint
@NUFC_Stats I wouldn't. Can't see us going down again!
@MsiDouglas No. 6 pts ahead of Mackems is only good thing.. We will end up in 15th-16th position.
Newcastle (33) have scored less than Leicester (34) and QPR (38) this season #nufc #LCFC #qpr #ASHLEYOUT

@dpkjnair @StarSportsIndia We had in SS2 and HD2. They removed from BOTH! Hideous people of Star Sports!
Wish @StarSportsIndia never ever get #BPL rights. OUT OF 8 BLOODY CHANNELS, THEY TAKE OFF NEWCASTLE'S MATCH AND PUT IN BADMINTON!
Wish @StarSportsIndia never ever get #BPL rights. Never get to watch #nufc matches!
@StarSportsIndia is a channel where they promise one and give us something.! Rubbish people running the channel.. Grow up guys!

@llkhan8 Liked it.. But what's with the diamond formation ! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Back up midfielders .. Obertan, Sammy, Aarons, Gouffran. Who knew we will have such good options under Ashley era  #nufc
Cabella, Sissoko, Siem de Jong. That mid field !!!!!!  #nufc

@NeilKnighton thank u. I wanted to know if I can retain him on Fantasy PL ..
Why was Chadli not started last game? #THFC fans anyone? And will he start next match? #thfc
@NUFCinnocent Whatever anyone says . No ones coming mate. Probably a good head coach. But we cant expect for European places anytime soon!!
@NUFCinnocent Also we will never have a "manager"  for at least 3 yrs I guess..
@NUFCinnocent Sorry but who's that top manager?
Newcastle is the most busiest club on Jan transfer 2015. 9 'outgoings' . #celebrations #nufc
@NUFCinnocent "top"??  "manager" ????? Mate this is Newcastle not Arsenal .. A club with no passion ..
Oh!! Just forgot.. 9 outgoings.. Including Pardew. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> lol .. Joke club!! #TransferDeadline  #nufc
So in total, on this Jan transfer window we had 8 total outgoings..  Bigi, Ferguson, Mbabu, Streete, Vuckic, Santon, MYM and HBA. #nufc
5 players loaned out to Rangers. Santon loaned to Inter.. 6 outgoings none signings. #nufc 
@NewcastlePro That's one thing I hate to write article on. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Coming from Santon's official fb page. Goodbye to another loved player  #nufc #deadlineday 
@NenaCOYG U still want more than 11m to be spent? LOL #Heights

@flanders603 Thanks !!  Howay the lads!!
@flanders603 I hate to consider myself as a pessimist. All I want is a good end than only aiming for the future..
@flanders603 If he can show some ambition and buy a player or 2 we can get to 8-10 pos which is more better than 11-17 ..
@flanders603 I believe if v can buy players now or later doesn't matter.. The length of the contract never change.. 6yr it is..
@flanders603 I get what u said but if we aren't trading players in transfers  or wont end below 10th place then our reputation is bashed..
@John_Martinn Happy ONLY if they sign..
@Deepak_Toon Yeah and the man will be waiting for promotion of highest order. LOL

Step 1 : Look up Pardew's record
Step 2 : Keep expectations low &amp; realise this is honeymoon period
Step 3…
@dpkjnair oops. FA Cup crash? Sucks isnt it bro?
Excellent article by @PavelSrnicekGK  #nufc 

Oh just forgot - "We just couldn't get a manager over the line." #nufc
So so sooooo badly waiting for @siemdejong and @R_Aarons16 to return! My eyes will be filled with happiness when they make a comeback #nufc
Most sought out player and my future favorite @R_Aarons16 never looks to comeback to Newcastle !! C'mon. #nufc
Just cant believe how @NUFC are convincing us that we are a 25-men squad. How stupid it is to consider Hatem, Darlow, Lascellas, Jonas #nufc
What in the world is wrong with @R_Aarons16 ? Return date went from December end to unknown-date. Some mystery at Newcastle as always #nufc

@bluechamprocks @NUFC We did pretty well that you're thinking. Great saves by Cech.. U know we shook u in the first half. lol #nufc
@AwakeStephen Working great for us. We are getting a better one !! Get stuck with him fr next few years . he's slow poison.. Lol #nufc
Funniest part is when you realize @SackPardew page was created instead of Sack Ashley!! #nufc

#nufc 
@ms_sissoko to go, Ameobi to come, no manager to sign and no incomings. Worst days ever!! #ProAshley #Madafakka #nufc

@silentfoot @lee_ryder That's another dream for us fans. But under MA if u think we're gonna get some glory times u just gonna whine! #nufc

@HD_07 Sr. Woodman gonna take his son away. Lol
@HD_07 Dunno but he surely will have Jr. Woodman
@NUFCrumours I fucking agree!!
@PARKY_92 Bruce sucks as well. Never a fair choice. He isn't proven by any chance..
@singh_jp Klopp will fuck off hearing upon Ashley's demands. Lol.
@gavinquinlan I'm not saying he is great or fantastic manager. But he hasn't got a great bit of support. He had done good under Ashley!
@gavinquinlan take example of King Kev. He walked off from NUFC and told its never Pardew's fault for downgrading of the club. #nufc
@gavinquinlan Why to slag off in such a barbaric way? Yes he has been bad in derby but do u think under Ashley our fortunes change? NO
Don't know who writes this but such sad shit! Not tht I'm a huge fan of AP but that's not how u send people off #nufc 
If Bruce comes he ll try to win only derby matches.. We ll be in a bad position under him. Don't get started on Collocini or Kinnear.
But sad to see people slagging him off. So disrespectful! Under Ashley its always going to be a bad time for us. People are blind!! #nufc
1/2 Just hoping that next manager who comes is a technically sound and adept manager. That's the thing itching us. #nufc
Watching these news on Pardew since yesterday. Very excited for the reason his existence in nufc had been frustrating. #nufc 1/1
My choice for next Newcastle manager - Pulis, Sherwood, De Beor, Martinez, Brendon Rodgers #nufc
@CorkingToon De Boer, Tim Sherwood, Tony Pulis. These 3 would be great.! Koeman definitely not possible considering his arrival.
@LukeEdwardsTele No ways. Bruce isn't great at all. We need someone with pure class like Tim Sherwood. Pulis would be good. #nufc
Woke up to the news of Pardew leaving! I'll be happy only if Pardew is replaced with a proper manager like Sherwood and not Warnock #nufc

@zhorze Oh sorry! Misread the word.. Yeah tough to believe he was better than Falcao there. But I think Riviere needs a bit of inspiration!
After loss, Sunderland fans spelled Jack's name as C0-1back!! #FuckOffMackems #nufc
@BenDinnery De Jong still ONE MONTH away! WTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@zhorze Sorry who outsourced Falcao? Man U did that if I'm not wrong?

@HD_07 lel
HOWAY @elgalgojonas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CMOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #NUFC
Its always this. We beat bigger team than smaller ones. We won against Chelsea, #LFC, Spurs and Citeh. Lost to Stoke and Sunderland #nufc
No worries Toons. @TaylorR1984 , @siemdejong , Gabby, @R_Aarons16 , @TimKrul and Santon comin in few weeks! We'l rip every team apart! #nufc
Van Gaal is no Moyesah. But we can crack their defense. With Tiote suspended,  Abeid is best option who I think is better than Tiote #nufc
Moving on then... Man Utd next at Old Trafford.. #nufc
Had to change the subject line. Mackems were better team yesterday. We fkd it up royally.. #nufc
If we could have scored 2, they could have scored 3.. Ameobi and Gouffran shudn't have featured at all.. #nufc
League Cup lost, Derby lost. Can't ask worse thing than this! #nufc
We had the most attacking formation. 4-2-4 and yet couldn't score on a derby. Disgrace !! Gouffran shouldn't even be near bench #nufc
U got no fans Sunderland!! #nufc 

#nufc
@NUFC_Stats Colback last kick of the game winner. Apply salt to your wounds! #nufc
Colback WILL celebrate if he scores today vs Sunderland. “Of course..
I’d probably be in the Gallowgate End with my shirt off" #haha #nufc
@typicaldixon Hope so mate..
Biggest derby match!! Newcastle vs. Sunderland. I can feel the excitement even from thousand miles away #nufc #safc

Unbelievable Newcastle fans!! Fucking best!!! 35,000 attendance at White Hart Lane and Newcastle fans made Spurs fan look like a joke #nufc
@goifcentral_BNE Dammit. Feel sorry for u mate!
Aarons rejects new Newcastle United contract. #nufc
Jurgen Klopp for Newcastle!! #nufc
Newcastle could turn to an experienced campaigner like Mark Schwarzer, third choice at Chelsea after Alnwick is injured. #nufc
@NUFCinnocent I agree.. Our bench sucked.. I have no clue why the heavens treat us so bad time n time again!
Injuries at Newcastle is a joke. Big joke. #nufc
How can Newcastle not learn anything from close pasts? Losing by a huge margin in league cup which matters a lot is utter nonsense #nufc
Not to blame Pardew. But the Manager of the Month award is just a bad luck to us. Irreversible logic!! #nufc
Devastated!! Completely broken from the inside. Newcastle losing 4-0 at League cup. ANOTHER CUP GOES OFF #nufc
Alnwick's got a shoulder injury.. To me its a fake news. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #nufc
This is my line up against Spurs tomorrow! #nufc 
Tough new rules on Malaysian tourism 
@Claire_Allen13 Northern rock &lt;3
@Lord_Sugar says it was lucky for #nufc to win by luck? What is a luck as per your dictionary? Tottenham is lucky to in @premierleague! lol
I saw tweets from @Lord_Sugar regarding Pardew. He's Former @SpursOfficial chairman? Haha. Says a lot about him. Stinky team stinky chairman
Newcastle lost to Arsenal. Indian cricket team lost to Aus. Indian hockey team lost to Pak..
Bad day indeed!! #nufc #afc
@0o0AMY0o0 howay! ;)
woah! Danny Ings' facebook account is hacked. lol #nufc #bfc #BurnleyFC
So Ramsey out too. Best chance for us to win this game!! Please lads. Lets win this against them. Been long time! #Nufc
MATCH DAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!!! #ARSNEW #AFCvNUFC  #afc #nufc
So Newcastle will have so many new signings in Jan transfer market. Santon, Siem de Jong, Obertan, Krul, Elliot and RTaylor.!! #banter #nufc
Aarons out for Arsenal game! Dammit!  #nufc
Take it.. On your face @juniorbachchan . Newcastle 2 - 0 Chelsea. #banter #nufc 
Major blows for #nufc : Collocini, Aarons, Sissoko, STaylor 
For #afc : Koscielny, Wilshere, Walcott, Arteta. #AFCvsNUFC
Arsenal will be without Wilshere, Walcott and probably without Ramsey too. Seems like Debuchy might play as CB. Time to exploit them!! #nufc
Having good time reading @mohanstatsman 's tweets! Absolutely brilliant stats man!!
I really started to like @StarSportsIndia's online stream.
@StarSportsIndia @doshmeisterr Office connection??

@mohanstatsman If this is true, could you provide links?
Ayoze Perez from Newcastle has won the November Goal of the Month for this cheeky little back heel #FutureStar #nufc 
@Futbol_Agent_ Just bullshit, unless they sell anyone!
@azizaldakheel48 ??
Horrible to see such a great player in tears!! Get well soon #Aguero !  #mcfc 
@azizaldakheel48 Source?
@DanishAtheist hahaaaaaa
Star debutant @alnwick42 got a winner for us yesterday! Wish all the best for his future.! #nufc
Jose Mou said he didn't expect time wasting like Newcastle. No one knows y 6' was added. Last yr they did the same against Liverpool! #nufc
Look at Costa!! Right in Alnwick's pocket. Errrrm pocket??  <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD> #nufc 
Haha..  #nufc 
@wes296k @nufcfans expected in 1st week of Jan
@dpkjnair No offense, obviously. The pub environment was electric. But hated those many Chelsea fans. Booing and calling us for no reason!
@dpkjnair @NUFC Dammit. I shat in my pants bro!! I swear I cant express d happiness. But d pub I was in, I swear Chelsea fans were deluded!
@bluechamprocks yes.. Results please :D
TOON TOON BLACK AND WHITE ARMY!!
All the top teams - thank us for beating a team which you couldn't.. 
Newcastle and Proud!! &lt;3 #NUFC
7. Hazard, Costa, Oscar, Terry and many fans were in our pockets!!
8. Best part - Me and my friend wore Cisse's shirt!! Haha!
5. Beat the so-called-top team
6. We were in a place filled with 30-40 Chelsea fans booing our team every time for no reason (Unethical)
2. Met my first Newcastle fan friend here in a pub here today. 3. We wr down with 10 men
4. Alnwick,a reserve GK came for 12th injured playr
BIGGEST DAY OF MY LIFE. Newcastle 2 - 1 Chelsea.
Here's why -
1. I’m an adopted Geordie fan from Bangalore, India
1/many
@Naan_aniket We will end ur run. ;)
@BenDinnery is an amazing source for injury lists in Premier League!!
Very sad to see Ben Arfa ruining his career. One of my fav players #nufc
I've no problems with Loic Remy. He was excellent for us, the reason we wr far from relegation spot last season. He deserves Chelsea. #nufc
MATCH DAY.  #nufc vs #cfc at St. James' Park. Buzzing!!
Bruce is furious with Ben Arfa for his attitude during the clash vs ManUtd and wants to cut short his loan spell at the KC Stadium. #nufc
#NUFC vs #CFC - Last 10 matches: Won 5 Draw 2 Lost 3
@EPLIndex LOL. That was Cisse 20 years back probably haha :D
@dpkjnair haha it is mate. Fingers crossed .. Wish Mou never wins at SJP :P
Where the fuck is Facundo Ferreyra !! #nufc
1 more day for Match day!! #CFC #nufc
@LaurenceTaylor6 Collo and Aarons aren't playing.. Abeid/Colback has got to play!!
My team lineup against #cfc-
Elliot, Janmaat, Saylor, Dummett, Haidara, Abeid, Colback, Cabella Sissoko Perez Cisse #nufc
@jackfowles13 Haha nice stats mate. What if it was considered second half then? Newcastle be on top 3 I am sure. Lol. #nufc
Cabella was a gem! I always always wanted him on pitch from 1st minute. He can break Chelsea's defense! C'mon Pardew. Get him started! #nufc
Cisse's goal was good but it seems that he lost his form back. WHY! #nufc
#nufc vs #burnley Gouffran has been really bad and invisible yet again. No one has a clue why Pardew starts him ahead of Cabella.
Biggest questions need asked about training why there so many injuries for @NUFC ?? #nufc
Newcastle's squad strength is 30. 15 players out of them are injured. Hilarious or disastrous? #nufc
History on #nufc against #burnleyfc : 40 wins , 17 draws, 41 lost. We lost more? Woah!!
@R_Aarons16 Ah look at this!! Amazing words from a very young lad! Howay lad!
@NUFCinnocent From his pt of view, a baby, of course. I did not complaint his absence ..
Rob Elliot might miss Newcastle game too.!! Cant say anything.. He is expecting a baby anytime.. #nufc
Watching @therealrussellp's show (Notorious - 2013). I swear to God no one has ever made me laugh so much !!!!!
@thejamieherd Lol ok. I thot the squad
@thejamieherd 22
Meme creation is an art.. Come one lads get us a win!!  #nufc 
Newcastle are 5th least goal scorers by Mid Fielders in Premier League so far #nufc
Probably for the first time ever I am not excited on Match Day! #nufc


Williamson and Haidara are out with a knock! WTF!!!! #nufc 
No Janmaat, Sissoko, Colback, Collo. Abeid #nufc
@BenDinnery Haha okay. I missed the update..
@BenDinnery Thank you. I hope no one had forgotten him.. Someone must come up and give updates from management..

#NUFC 
Newcastle injury list increased to 13 players!! Who's left btw except Pardew? #nufc
@BenDinnery Ben, any news on Santon? His return was supposedly on December 1st week right.
Janmaat out for mid week fixture against @BurnleyOfficial !! Oh Gawwwwwwwdddddddddddddddd! Pls help us! a #nufc
@BenDinnery Ah nawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Reports in France suggest the Magpies have already made contact regarding a possible deal in January for Andrew Ayew. #nufc
Arsenal will definitely buy Tiote. They are planning for Cabaye and Sissoko as well !! Are they poor man's Liverpool? #afc #nufc
This is why you lose respect on players. He can just fuck off #nufc 
I wont be gutted if Tiote leaves. But Arsenal are planning for @ms_sissoko  for 15m pounds. I wish he wont go! #nufc
I so feel @AyozePG can be a huge revelation !!! #nufc
Well Sammy did save a goal yesterday but also gave ball away in crucial places. He really did. He could have been a stand out player #nufc
@AyozePG continues to impress everyone. One of the best surprise package of Premier League so far!! #nufc
La Liga should be named as "2 and a half Liga" #fcb #RMFC #AtleticoDeMadrid
Newcastle play Burnley on 2nd Dec with no Sissoko and Colback due to suspension. Hopefully Collo and Abeid are back! #nufc
2/2 Tiote shud be sent Arsenal too. He's no more zeal! We played to draw. Pardew trying to be a prick again. Haidara n Colback impressed me!
#whufc 1 - 0 #nufc. Talking pts- Gouffran in starting a bad choice. Ameobi could have passed on an occasion when Cisse was available.! 1/1
#whufc 1 - 2 #nufc is my predictions.
MATCHDAAAAAAAYYYY #nufc
I wish Cabaye will replaced by Cabaye .. #nufc
The tribute given on TV by @MClarke23 was such a hard thing to watch! Remembrance with cricket Oz, friend's and family! #PhilHughes
@mycousin1975 Oopsie!! Sorry ! But anyways this is happening.
Today there will be round of applause as tribute to Phil Hughes at St. James' Park, I read! AMAZING!!!!!!! #nufc
Hate this!! Krul out for a month!! #nufc
Pardew- "I think he’s been a big success at West Ham. Actually, if you speak to any West Ham fans, they’ll tell you that." Anyone? #whufc
Alan Pardew has claimed many players as his favorites in the past but have bought none except Cabella! #Carroll #nufc
Newcastle after 12 matches in the last 5 yrs - Average Position: 7th, Average Points: 19, Average Wins: 5, Average GD: +7 #nufc
Newcastle after 12 matches in the last 5yrs are found at 5th position and above- thrice, with an average of 19 points! 5 average wins! #nufc
@BenDinnery Hi there. Is Costa injured? I can see he had a 'Knock' in the site,
Tim Krul joins the injured list of Newcastle players! He's the 12th man to get a 'knock'. Wat's happening! R they training for army? #nufc

@BenDinnery thanks
RIP Phil Hughes!! May your soul rest in peace!!
A big YES! #nufc 
I think we dont need any striker for this season @AyozePG , @CissePapiss , @ManuRiv and @AdamArma9 suffice! We need Tiote replacement #nufc
Newcastle United are reportedly lining up a £9m January bid for Borussia Monchengladbachstriker Max Kruse  #nufc
@PremierInjuries I can't see any news that he will feature .
@henrygayle @YaSh_DeE_15 Dortmund will win. Arsenal just has potential nothing else. 0 performances.
@BenDinnery Hi Ben. Whats the status on Downing? I know potential return is 29. But will he feature against Newcastle?
Potential threat of Premier League - Newcastle United  #nufc 
Potential threat of Premier League - Newcastle United 
Chelsea. We are coming for ya to stop your run!! #cfc #nufc
Newcastle have won 3 consecutive Home games in 1-0 victory. #nufc
@dpkjnair Its on 6th Dec ;) Game on. Time to stop ur run! :D
@BenDinnery Dammit!! :'( 6 more weeks! He is cursed I think. I hate it!!
Did you know - "Jose Mourinho has NEVER won at St James Park" #nufc
Newcastle United is the 1st team to win 5 PL matches in a row this season. #nufc
What is up with Tottenham. lol. Hull are beating them easy!
Last 3 matches between Palace and Liverpool are fancy and funny. 3-1 win for Liverpool, then 3-3. Now 3-1 win for Palace #CPFC #LFC
The last time Newcastle conceded a goal and 'lost' was on 30th September. #nufc
I wish to meet @therealrussellp. I mean he's such a huge talent and performer. I wish I'd the luck to meet him! Come to Bangalore again pls!
I started watching @therealrussellp's shows only 3 years ago. Have seen few shows. Hilarious!! The best stand-up comedian.
@therealrussellp I had seen NDTV's interview with Russell. Saw it again. I'd to share it because every word he says is TRUE SHIT and FUNNY!
@therealrussellp The best thing about Russell's jokes arent just that he is saying it but it is true! They are so real!!  Reflects identity
@therealrussellp Dammit. This guy makes me laugh so much.! Keep up Russel!!
@MassadioHaidara  is the joint Man of the match for me!
I think @MassadioHaidara not getting much praise. We have 50% of the attack on the left and its because of him majorly. #nufc
@SimonJudson Take a break mate. Krul is absolutely brilliant!!
I wish @TaylorR1984's injury is nothing serious!! I really wish and pray God he is okay and back into action soon! #nufc
Very happy for the win!! But my heart breaks the second I see or think about @TaylorR1984's departure today. #nufc
@AyozePG was just amazing today. Created many chances. Should have converted those chances. But this guy is a future star!! #nufc
@PaulDummett is such a brilliant and versatile player. Made a mistake today bt was invisible compared to his performance. Absolute gem #nufc
What a performance by @MassadioHaidara !! He proved that he is the ideal LB!! Get in lad! #nufc
@ms_sissoko the absolute beast! Perfect captain. The man with utmost commitment.. #nufc
Cmon Newcaaaastleeeeeeeeeeeeee #nufc
C'moooonn Newcastle see we were we were #nufc
I just cannot take this gush of happiness!!!! 5th PL win plus 4th position!! Woooooooooooooo .. Fk yeah!! #nufc
Wilshere headbutted Fellaini.!! If THAT goes without any bans then FA is run by bunch of uneducated people! #nufc #afc #FA #mufc
@TaylorR1984 crying and leaving the ground.. HEART BREAKING STUFF. I'm depressed! <SLEEPY FACE> #nufc
MATCH DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #Nufc #qpr
@HD_07 He  features in top 11 and is a miss.. Some news it is :D
Taarabt still not fit. Isla and Vargas are yet to pass to the fitness test and are doubtful against Newcastle this Saturday. #qpr #nufc
Provided @NUFC sell Tiote (evidently) it is realistic to buy Cabaye or any CB #nufc
If @NUFC spend cash in Jan transfer on Cabaye/ Mitrovic/ Virgil Van Djik, they benefit themselves because we might end up 5th or less #nufc
@CissePapiss appeared and scored 2nd of the 3 goals scored by Senegal against Botswana in Africa Nations Cup #nufc 
@alexander_shea Really? But he is a goal machine!!
@BenDinnery Yep. He indeed is.. Anyways. Thanks for the news though..
AC Milan is interested in Newcastle target Aleksandar Mitrovic of #Anderlecht. Come on! Jus fuck off. Let us have one proper striker #nufc

#NUFC #SAFC #FTM 
@BenDinnery But sad to know Collocini is out until Chelsea game..
@BenDinnery Ryan had minor injuries after the Stoke game I read somewhere. Not major but out for a week along with Collo..
@BenDinnery I read somewhere Ryan is injured. Also, Cisse was subbed during Liverpool match off because off knee injury and is back by Dec?
@Claiiree96 @reelM_abeid  Abeid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@PremierInjuries Good website there. But I already found couple of player's name missing in Newcastle injury list. Cisse and Ryan Taylor.
@BenDinnery Good website there. But I already found couple of player's name missing in Newcastle injury list. Cisse and Ryan Taylor.
@EveningChron Well I can see now it is 52% +
I'm hoping that @R_Aarons16 will sign a new big contract with Newcastle. I just wish he does.! He is going to be my fav player soon. #nufc
Demba Ba has confirmed he has no intention moving out of Istanbul. #Besiktas #nufc

Dammit!! Another Newcastle player injured.. Wtf! Get well soon Abeid.. #nufc
Abeid injured during Intl break :( #nufc 
@Nathaniel_Clyne Very impressed with Clyne!!
Newcastle on top of the table!! #nufcU21
@Nathaniel_Clyne is an amazing RB. He is looking absolutely great today. Runs swift, great crosses, good tackles, aggressive. #ENGvSA #Eng
Dismal first half. Welbeck at his best #Sarcasm #ENGvSA
How the hell is Roy Hodgson an England manager? And how the fk does Welbeck starts? #ENG #nufc
Watching England vs Slovenia #ENGvsSA
If Tiote goes off who looks likely to move out from Newcastle we need to get Grenier !! #nufc
@YCabayeofficiel Don't sell Cabaye, Yohan Cabaye,I just do't think u understand, Coz if u sell Cabaye, Ur going to have a riot on your hands
International break. WTF!! Fuck off!! #nufc
Colback and Janmaat. #Wow #nufc 
Andy Carroll somehow comes to SJP and suddenly people loose their mind.. He ain't be back guys. Forget him.  #nufc



#NUFC
Rohith Sharma scored 264 !!!!! And I missed watching it. DAYUUUUMMMMM!!!!!!!! Very surprised!!
Aye!! #nufc 
Short movie created by me on Newcastle @NUFC 2014 - 
Please watch.. #nufc
Hahahahaaa!! 
 
Newcastle aiming for Anderlecht's Mitrovic? Sure it is exciting but how true is this? #nufc


Most funniest comment read - Southampton scored 8 vs Sunderland.. Imagine what they will do to Man Utd.
@Modou Barrow - the man to watch out for this season! #nufc #swfc #BPL
Defender problems in #FPL
@AdamArma9 - the next biggest England striker. Watch out for this space #nufc
I feel Welbeck deserves many more chances to shine, yet I feel he is as overrated as Moyes by Sir Alex Ferguson. #afc
Good to see David Moyes getting back to what he is good at.. #RealSociedad
If #saintsfc gets through this tough fixture, which I wish they will, then it will be a fabulous Premier League #SFC #nufc
Excited about #saintsfc next 10 fixtures. Man City (H), Arsenal (A),Man Utd (H),Everton (H), Chelsea (H), Arsenal (H), Man Utd (A) @SFC
What Bellamy said doesn't make me anger. C'mon! We aren't as big as Liverpool definitely. They got many FA, League and CL Cups.! #nufc

@NatashaNUFC True that. But we will get this today.
@NatashaNUFC Convinced?? Seriously?
My line-up for today: @TimKrul , Janmaat, STaylor, Collo, Dummett
CDM: Abeid, @TaylorR1984 ADM: Cabella , Sissoko , Aarons, F: Cisse #nufc
Toon Toon black and white army!! #nufc
@dpkjnair Hope so. Waiting for their second string of contest. :)
@Kylejoness_ Well, in India it was. haha.
All the 3 newly promoted clubs are in the bottom of the Premier League table. #lcfc #bfc #QPRFC
@MakaylaMoses And I just noticed u copy pasted the status!! <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>
@MakaylaMoses same thought. Probably Tiote is a great possession to us but loolomg the current squad size Ashley will sell him.
MATCH DAAAAAAY!!!!! Cmon Toons!! Get this win!!  #wba #nufc
Charlie Austin scored a hattrick today. Actually! #CPFC
@DealsForGeeks  When is the next contest?
@dpkjnair Is this for true?
Obertan out for almost 5 months until March 2015!! #GetWellSoon #SadNews #nufc.

In London, they can't handle Perez! #NUFC
#nufc 
Di Maria before. :P 
Wow #nufc 
I like this result. Brendon Rodgers is a nice and brilliant manager in my opinion. He deserves lot of chances at #lfc 
I’m voting in @TheFBAs for @TSBible as the Best #Social Football Account
"@lee_ryder: Aarons can be a 'great', says ex-Newcastle United hero Keith Gillespie 
@Sio_Chamberlain Haha. The match has been a joke in the end..
What a joke Arsenal. Not the 1st time this isn't it? Newcastle came back from dramatic 4-0 to 4-4 Typical Arsenal everywhere #4thPlace #nufc
@rscanderlecht Anderlecht drew with Arsenal's 3 first goals!! Bwahahahhahahahahha #rsca #nufc
I just hope @YCabayeofficiel won't join his love bird @MatDebuchy . <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD> #nufc
I will, no doubt, have Cabaye back at any stage. He was one of the best Toon player around then and got the squad improved. #nufc
@YCabayeofficiel will be made available in Jan. PLEEEEEAAASE come to Newcastle ! #nufc
2/2 "They are halfway up the table, and they are not that far off the top six now strangely enough." #nufc
King Kev-"I think the board there have got the rewards for sticking by him: and now they've got to keep it going." 1/2 #nufc
Welcome home champ @elgalgojonas . #Warrior #FuckCancer #nufc
Newcastle for Champions League!! #nufc
If Marco Reus got to City, its a definite misery for @BVB !! #BVB
Manchester City might strike a deal for @woodyinho . I think they might seal it looking at their current misfiring condition #mcfc #nufc
And now it is #RodgersOut banners are designed for their next game. Pathetic!! Grow up kids #lfc #nufc
Napoli might bid for Tiote for 12m pounds this Jan. #nufc
@Goal_India I'm happy that #nufc won. Manchester derby? I think City 2 - 1 Utd
@dpkjnair yeah! massive comeback. I want Pardew to be consistent. Too early to say he is the best.
@dpkjnair Its on 6th Dec.. 5 days before my birthday ! lol
Mourinho must come to Newcastle. The fans will defeat Chelsea before the ball is kicked. Chelsea crowd is a joke n its told by him #nufc
Mourinho- "At this moment it’s difficult for Chelsea to play at home, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium." Hahaa #nufc
Liverpool fans want Brendon Rodgers to get sacked. Fickle fans I must say. Absolutely clueless fans #nufc
Last 5 matches - 4 wins, 1 draw, 3 clean sheets, 3 goal conceded, 8 goal scores, 6 different goal scorers!!

Newcastle have scored only 5 goals less than Arsenal so far this season and only 3 goals from 6th placed Swansea City. #nufc

Just imagine the injured players back. Santon, Cisse, Aarons, Tiote and Siem De Jong. We gonna beat big teams in December. #nufc
Sissoko is the real beast! Perez showed what he can do. I always said he needed to start. I clearly knew Cabella can be a revelation #nufc
Absolutely played like champions - NEWCASTLE! With such an inexperienced starting lineup n an injury prone squad, I'm THE happiest fan #nufc
Newcastle are 4 pts behind from being 5th.  Sunderland are 4pts ahead from 20th!  #nufc
Whatever was the past, Alan Pardew deserves this. He really did great with this injury prone side  #nufc 
Newcastle in 14th position. Sunderland in relegation spot at 18th. #HWTL #nufc
Without a shadow of doubt, @ms_sissoko is the MOM ! A true fighter! He was the only one to muscle out each n every Spurs player  #nufc
FT Spurs 1 - 2 Newcastle #THFCvNUFC
Whatta fkn comeback!! I am gone mentalllllllllllllllllllll  #Entertainers #nufc

Happy birthday Jack Colback #nufc
@LuchoGarcia14 So awesome to see Luis Garcia play. Go on lad. Win it for us @atletidekolkata
@irSuhas @RemyCabella Ya mate.. I was shocked that Pardew kept him completely out in prev 2 matches. He is too good yo be benched..
"#NUFC boss Alan Pardew says they have not cast @RemyCabella into the cold 
@TommyKg10 wut!! U mad?
Sadio Berahinho is linked to a move to Liverpool !! This is why I hate so called big clubs. They all steal talents for money. #WBA  #nufc
Paul Gascoigne has been sectioned under the mental health act. #nufc
Guess the team with most conceded Goal Difference in history of Premier League. It is none other than Sunderland with −216. #nufc
@mohanstatsman Just a general question. How do you maintain a database on the stats? How do you get ideas to make different stats?
Today in 1863 11 London football clubs met to form the world's first …
If Chelsea beat Manchester United today they will be clear off by 6 points. Looks like another 2004/05 and 2005/06 season. #mufc #cfc
Projected Goal Against at the current rate for Newcastle will be 67. #horrendous #nufc
A win or a draw today gets the mackems in the relegation spot #HWTL #nufc
A win today against @SpursOfficial gets us to at 13th position in the table #BPL #THFC #HWTL #nufc
I had been thinking where the hell did Davide Santon gone? @lee_ryder tweets that he is another month away from getting fit. #nufc
A minute silence to all of them who made Aguero captain in their #FPL team. Including me *sigh*
I think the wisest manager is @RonaldKoeman #SaintsFC
Welbeck is ruining my Fantasy points #FPL
Is @R_Aarons16 in the team today? I'm waiting for his appearance. #nufc

But Obertan and Colback is better.
@NUFCinnocent That was icing on the cake. :D
@NUFCinnocent hahahaaaaaaaa!! Laughing my ass out!
@NUFCinnocent Hahaa!!! Stealing this mate.

Sunderland. Hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!! #nufc
@barker613 He is giving him so many chances to Gouffran instead of giving it to Cabella, Riviere and @AyozePG
So loved that @DelhiDynamos beat @ChennaiyinFC . Yay!! Take that on ur face Abhishek. #DelhiDynamos
The #SaintsSFC departed now Liverpool players deserve the position they currently are. #SFC #Selfish #nufc
My lineup against #THFC -

MATCH DAY!! #THFCvsNUFC #nufc
Abhishek Bachchan's last year prediction for Top 4 #PL position was a joke. Haha
@juniorbachchan You know your club wasn't even existing until Roman came in right? Your arguments are invalid.Chelsea=Money #trueclub #nufc
@juniorbachchan's reaction hasn't yet sparked among #mufc fans. Mr. Bachchan, as a celeb you were just too immature in your reaction. #shame
Happened to see @juniorbachchan 's interview on @StarSportsIndia. Wen asked where does #mufc might end this season. His ans- "Middle finger"
@irSuhas Ya buddy. I thought of getting Lamela but Eriksen is the actually threat.. Want Tadic as well.

@TaylorR1984 yesterday!! Howay!! Wish to see him in stating 11 soon #nufc 
I can imagine the scoreline if Newcastle is without Papiss, Tiote and Manu against Spurs. #nufc
Papiss might not start too. Injury United?? What the hell. #nufc
Players to watch out this GW. Lamela, Eriksen, Abel Hernandez, Pelle, Obertan, Jags, Aguero, Berahino, Wisdom, Vargas, Cisse, Zaha #FPL #BPL
Soldado need some polishing from manager. He is a good player turning out to be a failure this season. #THFC
Watching previous week's Premier League matches #addicted #PL #nufc
Twitter down!!Twitter down!! Twitter down!! Twitter down!! Twitter down!! 

Oh nein!!
I'm damn scared this weekend when #THFC plays against #nufc
#Lamela's Rabona-finish was just WOW
Harsh words.. Newcastle are in safe hands under Pardew, Ashley feels. Right where he think we belong.. Mid table #irony #nufc
Get well soon, @siemdejong . Fans await you. #nufc
@Lascelles16 isn't coming to Newcastle in Jan. We now have to manage with Saylor, Williamson and Collocini for the next 5-6 months #nufc
Its gonna be another classic weekend #ElClasico and Manchester Utd vs Chelsea #ManUtd #cfc
@twosixeight Even though the transfer window is shut??
I would say @realmadrid is gonna beat @FCBarcelona even though it is a comeback of Suarez.
How did Sunderland get a new player Reveillere at this time? #nufc

@Goal_India @FCGoaOfficial @atletidekolkata  Atletico have the slight edge. In #Fikru we trust!!

We need to FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENCE #nufc
@NUFC's Min of fan forum meeting is a mere joke. To sum up, Ashley is glued, no Jan transfer, Pardew stays forever, MYM will be sold #nufc
“The club's minimum target this season is to finish in the top ten of the Premier League.” #MOM  #Joke  #TheGreatMikeAshley #nufc
“The club are continuing to look at potential targets but stressed no guarantee could be made in reference to January" #MOM  #Joke #nufc
#Souness was so confident before the #LFCVSRM match that he is hiding behind the bushes by now #nufc #lfc #RM
So #AIBA punishes Sarita Devi for reacting during the game by SUSPENDING her!! This is what u experience from a bunch of politicians #Shame
Sarita Devi suspended by #AIBA. A shameful act by people who run the sport. Taking away the career of a genuine player is a sin. #Shame
"@FootyLaughs: The remix to ignition... 

@FootyLaughs wtf. There's no Newcastle!
Was it Champion League or fight between Cat and Mouse? #horrible #FCB #CFC #BMFC #shaktardonetsk
No wonder players like Pardew. He supports them, gets them back. Gav chances to Willo, provided support to Obuurtaan. #PlayersMan! #nufc
Alan Pardew: “When he came back pre-season, and I had assembled a new squad, I knew he could be a part of it, and I told him that.”  #nufc

Biggest Irony of Newcastle United fans. Second longest serving manager. Alan Pardew. Achieved titles- Zero. #nufc
Who is Mike Ashley? A person even animal hates him. #nufc
Never underestimate Newcastle just now. You never when the hells break loose. #ToughAsEver #nufc
I won't be surprised if Leicester beat us this Saturday. @OfficialFOXES are a promising side!! #nufc #LCFC
Swansea are loosing the PL places and Newcastle are gaining constantly. #SCFC #nufc
On the other hand if Newcastle don't end up Top half by this year end, its a horrible most season till date. #nufc
Man U dont have CL to compete nor League Cup. No complaints of player tiring. Its more than disaster if they don't end up top 2 spots. #mufc
If Manchester United don't compete for title or end up as runners up it's a horrible season to them. #mufc
Breaking News: Pardew is sacked .. in a parallel universe!! #nufc
@CooperShalevski Will be a good contest surely mate.
@NUFCinnocent LOL mate. Looking at the present situation, 10 pts I said looks like an exaggeration.
Possible 10 pts. Leicester City - 1
#WBA, #QPR, Burnley - 9 #nufc 
Sir John Hall's words are enthralling!! #nufc

@guardian_sport One of the fav #9 !!
@lee_ryder Please let us know if there are any transfer rumors for Newcastle.
@daryljanmaat89 is a top lad! Gives everything in a match. Well done. Keep up.
December fixture for @NUFC- Burnley (A), Che (H), Ars (A), 5under1and (H), Man Utd (A) and Eve (H) We gonna start winning RIGHT HERE! #NUFC
I think we will end up in Top 8 this season.
Definitely hurts to see where we stand at the moment. #18th #nufc
Cabella already benched when Pardew knows its difficult n need time to settle! Gouffran has been running clueless n no one bats an eye #nufc
Have a lot of faith in him. @RemyCabella  #nufc 
Looking at Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton performing so bad to their potentials, I've got a bit of hope and optimism. #NUFC #MiseryNot4Long
Only 2 teams haven't got their win yet #NUFC #burnleyfc
@roykaviani I liked the team even though the its unrealistic from Pardew's pt of view. He neither make 2 strikers play nor Sissoko in center
@CluelessPardew Secret poison. But he's going good.
@juventusfcen's last 30 home records: Win - 28, Draw - 2, Loss - 0. At least one team with Black and White is doing great #Juventus #NUFC
#nufc stats: Despite being in 18th position at the moment, @NUFC have lost only thrice in the last 8 matches. #nufc
#nufc are  are only 7 points of a CL spot.
@CissePapiss is just 1 goal away from joint 2nd position in PL goal score list #nufc
#nufc stats:Two weeks ago we were 20th, last week 19th, this week 18th - moving on up!
My Stat Attack: Last year at this time Newcastle United were 16th. By the end of November, we were on 5th position. #nufc

@Zmiler7 Get off Charnley from this pic. U no nothing of what he did this year..
With Colback, Aarons, Cabella and Riviere to start because of no choice, we need to rename our team as Newcastle under 22 United.. #nufc
Took time to decide on SDJ's injury Mr. Pardew? Set everyone free for once #nufc
@BonjourMonAmiNE  we will .. We will.. Lose lose..
2/2 .. Because its horrible to wish my team to lose for that one person. Its against the spirit of sports. #nufc
If the news is true Pardew given 2 games before he could be sacked, I would wish Newcastle would draw the matches. #nufc 1/2
Frankly, to be a Newcastle fan is such a tragic and hopeless the moment. But then... there's always that tingling hope. #nufc
I will be joining any kind of #PardewOut brigade here on.  #nufc
@darennarcis haha.. true that..
@irSuhas Lil late I think. But ya.. there was 2 .. Both outgoings. No surprises. lol.

1. #MCFC  2. #AFC  3. #CFC  4. #MUFC  5.#NUFC  6. #LFC 7. #EFC  8. #THFC  9. @stokecity  10. #SFC
Why don't #Liverpool buy the club instead ? #LFC #SFC
#Remy has one choice now. Join us at #nufc. You can dream of big here this season!! #QPR #nufc
The Saints are collapsing with the kind and no of players sold!! #SFC #nufc
The transfer news are completely dead. Really bad. Cmon guys get that thing on again!!  #nufc
@Ngaruthi How can you think that way!! He was on a LOAN.. And its his wish to pursue a CL team. He deserves it.
@ConnorLinsdell9 Faking news
@Geordie_news its going to be 3-0 to #nufc
@mycousin1975 @NUFC_Stats And for him, #nufc is the last choice!! Hell no..
@mycousin1975 @NUFC_Stats You wouldn't have someone who missed the last games because "it doesn't matter". All those clubs backstabber Remy
@clark_nicky Why is Willo benched??
Still believe crap fake news on Hernandez?  You need to calm down!? #nufc
One reason why we can have faith on @ManuRiv. Shots on target increased year-by-year.Good sign for us. #Riviere #nufc 
@lee_ryder Carrol news pls? Carroll news.. Carroll news!!! I am hungryyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!
@Ifollowallnufc 2 RBs? I'd replace Kompany with Sagna
#Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette has agreed a move to #nufc but the French club are demanding £15.8m. Source: #bbcsport
Carroll for £15m? I'd love to see him in black &amp; white but in a cut-out price. #remy went for 8.5m with so many goals. 15m is a joke. #nufc
@daisywhitee Defo beautiful !!
Lyon slapped a £20m price tag on #Lacazette. Ashley will never break the transfer record for us. So its a goodbye to him. #nufc
@mark_wardle Transfers u talking about ?
@RBanerjee23 I highly doubt on the rumor! Y wud someone who has such high wage in top class club to plan to come to a club who're no where?
@david8elly @AndyTCarroll @NUFC true that!!
Master of stats in Cricket - @mohanstatsman #hatsoff #cricket
Are Newcastle still looking for more buyings? Should fans expect any sigming here on? #nufc #bpl #transfers
Borini has rejected offer from Sunderland. #safc #nufc #lol
@Christie3B completely agree!!
@MarcoConradie10 any source ?
@MatDebuchy All the best Toon!! Always gonna wear ur black n white jersey on me..
Welcome to @NUFC, @ManuRiv . #nufc #6thSigning
Welcome to @NUFC, #Janmaat!! Welcome to the TOON!!! #nufc
@RemyCabella10  at St. James' Park. #nufc 
Welcome to @NUFC on a 6 year deal , @RemyCabella10. It's time to have shirt with your name. #nufc #transfers 
And he is ours!!!! I' m buzzing!! #aaaawwwwyeaaah #nufc 
Alright. Joe Kinnear was the actual culprit til now. Well done Lee Charnley! Absolute buzzing with the transfers u made til now! #nufc
@Ratchel9 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE!!  <VICTORY HAND>
@ConnorDonza He is at a gun point !!
Really hot signing.. 10m for Remy Cabella !! #nufc #transfer
@RemyCabella10 signs a 6-yr deal with #nufc. Unbelievable. Absolute steal!! #nufc #transfer #growingpassion
@raoadithya7 Mine would be 2-1 like to #nufc. #mcfc #nufc
There are lots of posts on Clement Grenier coming to the Toon for 15m!! Is Ashley in a gun point or something??  #nufc #transfer
Soon to be Toon player, @daryljanmaat89 gave a beautiful assist!! #beware  #nufc
@Foxy_005 Yes u are the only one.. U gave an assist today.. He looks good..
@BPLtransfersUK .. U had one job!!
Full story: 
@NewcastleWAG Stupid link. Doesn't give any info.
Assuming Cabella coming in for 10m, signing up Loic Remy and 1 good RB. Tadaaaaa... Champions League dreams!! #nufc #CL  #BPL
If #Cabella is bought for 10m, I cant see more than 2 signings from #Ashley. This'd be my line up in this case. #nufc 
Newcastle is actually showing interest for Cabella for "12 mil". I must be dreaming or Ashley is high on something .. #nufc
U don't mess with Newcastle player aye! @TimKrul would have won it if you'd have saved a sub!! ;)  #nufc

with PSV

#NUFC
@MatDebuchy.. howay the lad!!
#ThankYouDebuchy for the awesome days. U will be missed at #nufc <DISAPPOINTED FACE> <WEARY FACE> @MatDebuchy . All the best at Arsenal. #nufc #afc
Dear @MatDebuchy, you were one of the versatile footballer of the new gen #Nufc. I'm still gonna wear your shirt whenever I play the game!
@Markpotts11 No!
Full story: 
@2606xoxlaurenje I have seen this status somewhere.. lol..
#nufc My most-wanted Newcastle United line up in a possible 4-4-1-1 formation. @NUFC_Stats @nufcfans 
@TGrayUK @NUFC_Stats @nufcfans Haha.. Benny upfront.. I love that.. But thats not gonna happen.!!
@OskarEriksson True but after WorldCup


@Tutfoster Taylor at RB? Oopsie.
@Skirgey 15m from Ashley's pocket? I highly doubt so.. I think Lacazette would be a good deal. And Zaha on a year long deal would be perfect
@Tutfoster @asabart14 Nah! HBA is perfect there !
@asabart14 U wanna make Grenier play as defensive MF??
Daryl Janmmat to #nufc soon after #WorldCup2014. That means, one more week to wait. #Sigh #nufc
Wish there is some signing this week !! #nufc
After listening to news of @MatDebuchy and rumors of @ms_sissoko =&gt; Sit down calmly. Try not to cry. Cry!! @nufc
#Liverpool is trying for shock move for @ms_sissoko from #nufc
@Arsenal have completed the purchase of Mathieu #Debuchy from #Newcastle for €14M.  #AFC #NUFC #ThankYouDebuchy

I certainly hope so!!

#nufc 
I am <FLEXED BICEPS> because I'm an NUFC supporter!!  <CLINKING BEER MUGS>
#mufc battling with #nufc for the right back Janmaat from The Netherlands. Cmon Toons sign him up!!

Debuchy - Bought for £5m, sold for £12m

£21.7m profit - sign of the times!!

#nu…
Moussa Sissoko is now targeted by @AS_Monaco and @LFC. Source - Le Equipe. #nufc
What a joke!! Arturo Vidal = 45m + Nani. #Digusting #mufc #lol
Pardew always asks for English players. #Zaha for 7 million. Go get him. Do not whine now. #nufc
Whatta wonderful day for @TimKrul !! Congo lad! #nufc
Lassoga to @HSV. Zaha available for £7million. #nufc
All the idiots who r whinning when Sharapova doesn't know Tendulkar, can you tell me who is the captain of Indian women football team? #STFU
How come all of a sudden people changing opinions on @MatDebuchy after transfer nsws that he is not that great and can't defend well? #nufc
@meades97 @TrueGeordieNUFC It wouldn't make much difference. Anything more than 2m is a waste signing ..
#Debuchy joins #Afc for £12m from #nufc. Via #metronews
In 2009, on this day, #MichaelOwen joined #mufc on free transfer from #nufc.
Luuk de jong .. Nah.. Nothing more than 2-3m. Would be poor gamble anyways . #nufc
#NUFC wanting to replace #Debuchy with #MicahRichards. Not bad if this happens. But sad to see our fav player go..
#CFC #MUFC #LFC #AFC 
#Debuchy #nufc #HeartBreakForCabaye 
How about NOT SELLING @MatDebuchy !! #Effoff #NUFC
@realdavidpenny What do u think? He is one of the best RB in Europe. Can go front and attack as well.
@beaverburn lol no why!!
#nufc are BUYING players. What's going on? #lol #thrilled
Welcome @siemdejong to @NUFC !! THRILLED!! #nufc
#lalalalaaaaaaaa Portugal are out most definitely.!!

@tfeditor1892 Who?
#premierleaguefixtures for #nufc are out. @MCFC it is.. Why do they like us so much? #nufc
If I had my own team,I'd surely pick @sterling31 over #Neymar any day! He's a prodigy. #lfc #ENG #WorldCup2014
Never heard of Guillermo Ochoa - Mexican Goal keeper before.. But must say , this was one of the best performances in #WorldCup2014 so far!
@brynll @NUFC__Fans Me wants.. Price pls?
I think its time to say goodbye to Hatem Ben Arfa!! :'( One of my favorite players.. Thanks for the good times ..  #nufc
Young prospect is @joeroot05 .. @RCBTweets Get him for us in next IPL #rcb

I'm 100% Geordie according to the #Geordieometer! I’m as Geordie as Shearer drinking Broon on the Tyne Bridge 
@AdamArma9 Hull? Are you playin for NUFC? I am already freaggin excited!! #nufc
It was a great treat to watch our Toon striker @LuukdeJong9 having good chemistry with #LoicRemy . Wish you guys will more for us #nufc

Hatem Ben Arfa and Davide Santon miss Hull City v Newcastle United at KC Stadium - Hartlepool Mail  #nufc
@ScottwilsonechoThe only worse feeling I ever had on Alan Pardew was the depressing performances of HBA. He did not perform under AP. #nufc
@Scottwilsonecho Very slow. If he gets in 1-2 youngster to this bad looking bench, that'd have been great!! #nufc
I'd give #DavideSanton chance from next game. He did miss @_LoicRemy. @LuukdeJong9 has just started playing good games #nufc
My starting line up against #hullfc .

@StarSportsIndia You have never tweeted on #EPL at all. Are you guys even interested in telecasting #EPL to us? #SellTheRights
@StarSportsIndia Today there is only ONE #premierleague highlights been shown. ONLY ONE!! #WakeupStarSports

@ItsNotFootball Scumderland they are!! #nufc
@StarSportsIndia How many times do you guys telecast EPL highlights in all of YOUR 4 channels? Once maybe? Worse thing for EPL fan  #NUFC
@tomkelk @nufcfans @Sammy_Ameobi Wooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww!! Why don't you show the same guts on field buddy? Ur awesome, did u realize that?
@StarSportsIndia WHAT!! Cricket matches are given for free in 
@PaulDummett Keep up the hard work lad. You will get a definite chance #nufc #nufcindiafans
@NUFCOfficial Cmon lads.. We can do it.. A place in the Europe!! #nufc #EuropaLeague #highhopes

@StarSportsIndia It was promised that @NUFCOfficial match will be telecast-ed previous week but you guys did not live up to your promise!!
@StarSportsIndia Dear SS, We football fans are sick of not able to view @premierleague matches live/highlights often.#NUFC #WakeupStarSports
For God's sake do one good thing Mr. Ashley, by signing @OfficialLRemy14 as permanent!! #nufc #AshleyOut
