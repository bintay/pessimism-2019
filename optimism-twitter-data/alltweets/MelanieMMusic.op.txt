Looking forward to another year of continuous growth, opportunity, fun, health and hustle. =)

hmm 
Time. Is. Flying.
@theMedicis I be waiting. =)
Everyone is mad...why you mad though? lol this ISN'T ABOUT YOU. There is a bigger problem at hand here.
Understand and grow together. It's something that's been needed for ages.
In order for us to come together efficiently as a whole human race, we need to love and accept within our own first. Understand, and grow.
Nobody hates you, nobody is against you...we're just for ourselves more than anything, more than ever.
Once people understand the system, and that racism still strongly exists we can start coming together PROPERLY not always play victim.
lol people still don't get it...
@AyyyRob try to make it! I'm going before work! It's from 6-730 according to the event pages so TRY so we can meet up and march together &lt;3
@theMedicis what's up brother

I can't see how you can bring yourself up to humiliating someone you love via social media. Just because it's there, 
doesn't mean use it.
Tomato on top of eggs on top of eggplants with feta, chick peas, carrots and cauliflower so good. #HealthisWealth

Byeee Bell! No patience for you.
@theMedicis just waiting for this news! Lol so ready
@theMedicis life real good no complaints just real busy ...like, real REAL busy lol what's good with you brother?
@theMedicis SIR!
My thought of the day is complete
Ppl learn from experience and surroundings. If you didn't have relationship trouble (ms/mr know it all) they wouldn't feel the need to help
to me, if you get easily bothered/offended by that...you've got some underlying issues to deal with
Sometimes a single person (who, mind you...may not have ALWAYS been single) could shed some light to something you may have overlooked
...as I'm sure the person offering advice doesn't know all but the point is they're trying to help whether you believe you're right or wrong
I don't see the big deal in single people giving others relationship advice. Just because you're CURRENTLY in one doesn't mean you know all.
=)
So uplifted
So excited
When opportunity knocks...
Last night. 
TORONTO, Looking for something to do this halloween friday? Contact me for tickets:

You can't win with more sin.
The way to respond to racist commentary is not with more racism, but perhaps educational facts.

We need to spread and applaud positivity. Doesn't matter who/what past it comes from. #SpreadLove #GiveLove
Why can't we as humans be happy for another's positive turnaround? Why does it have to be like "oh, she was a crackhead before" OK AND?...
Who am I to judge?
You have turned your shit around and therefore your past is almost completely irrelevant (unless you're on some serial killing shit).
If I meet you today, you're positive, and you're not the person you were 10 years ago (say you had a negative past). I commend you.
It's on YOU to turn yourself around.
It helps build you, the person u have chosen to be now. The changed u-- the new u. Whether prisoner, bully, asshole, etc...
Unless you're doing the same ol' shit all the time...your past doesn't reflect on the person you are today. (continued...)
one of those nights you just wanna sannggg...
@theMedicis MEDI! What's good my brotha?
When people tryna send their "trap music" for myself and the world to listen to...I'm cool, you can keep that! Keep hustling tho...
Think it's a game! They watchin'...they have BEEN watching.
Lol everybody out there worried about FB msgr apps lack of privacy...but check those other apps/games on ya phone! Same ish! lol smh
“If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter,” George Washington wrote in 1783.

Lol those who doubted words of wisdom before are learning now...and posting all about it.

Concerts and countries.
A playlist with @edsheeran , @Ryan_Acoustic, @_MAXWELL_, @ebenet , @JamesMorrisonOK, @samsmithworld, @MiguelUnlimited is all one could need.

Can I just explain the way I'm in musical love and been in it for some time now... 
I feel like every time Miguel does a duet with a female he always (unintentionally) outshines them. #RandomThought
This summer is BANANAS so far... I can BARELY keep up with myself! Phew! (wipes sweat off brow)
Why do these smartphones think they're so smart? Incorrectly finishing your sentences and shit... smh lol
So much to do...oye
Lauryn. Hill. 
Wonder how much these football players actually get compensated? Hmmm...

What looks good on the outside may actually be bad on the inside. (&amp;vice versa)
people like to forget what they've done to hurt or disrespect you...
That shit don't fly by me.
@comicjaymartin Very inspiring, thanks for the link! Is this monthly, quarterly, annually?
That is physical social progress.
Go out and talk to people, REAL people. People you can personally get to know, not just what they want to show...
Try socializing OUTSIDE out of social media networks...
Next up: peanut porridge.
That home made peanut punch! I do it... Zero added sugar and tastes better than store brands. I love peanuts.
@StefaniaSizzle great pics and quotes go perfectly, well done
@CeeJay868 sometimes I feel like I have to preach!! Lol =/
if they feel the need to defend themselves with posts that are supposed to be "funny". It makes me sad.
Mind you, if your weight makes you comfortable - good for you. These people obviously aren't comfortable if they feel the need to ...
I can't sympathize. I can't encourage that...
Some people, can't help it...I understand. Everyone has their story, but if you're sitting there with THAT as your excuse with no story ...
but love yourself enough to want to be healthy, to live a long happy, beautiful, and love-filled life.
I'm sick of seeing posts about being comfortable in your own "overweight" skin. It's great to love yourself, with great self-confidence....
Chick peas, cucumber, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives and feta cheese with olive oil, herbs and lemon juice. #YASSS #health #Delish
Definitely not used to interacting with people so often. =/ whoa
So much to do!!! So Imma just do it

If only I could clone myself. Multi taking at it's best. On a thousand...
So much that I want to do, all at once.
More than usual lately my mind has been keeping me up... Too much excitement in this noggin of mine.
Too complex in the mind.
Lamb burger and a side--hold the fries... Deluxe burger, homemade. #Foodie 
ENDLESS opportunity...
I just wanna do it all....

It's so easy, To think about Love, To Talk about Love, To wish for Love, But it's not always easy, To recognize Love...

@Xhyiworld more than people would like to think. If you don't work out and eat well, you'll have a flatter stomach with no defined abs...
@Xhyiworld right...however I never said that's the only way. They go hand in hand. I'm just saying nutrition is a big part of it...
@Xhyiworld it has a lot to do with how it builds up and whether it's abs on top of fat or overall lean, body mass.
@CeeJay868 are you down???
You could WIN suite tickets to Game 7 between Toronto Raptors vs. Brooklyn Nets on May 4th -Buytopia

Word of the day: Awareness
(Awareness requires a neural dialogue rather than any one key area.)
Tuneeee 
#Reggae #Kiprich
Then she'll wonder where she went wrong and why he won't communicate with her properly. "Whoops"  Such a damn shame.
Now, that kid's gonna grow up with better tech, do the same thing to her while she's tryna talk to him and he'll be there like "yeah, ok"
smh so hard if people learned to utilize technology better, communication would be so much greater
Saw this kid the other day tryna to talk to his mother, get her attention &amp; she's there glued to her phone like "yeah, ok" not even looking
People are too glued to their screens (TV, computer, CELL PHONES). It's crazy.
Present day technology is killing our society slowly but surely. It's meant to advance but instead holds back.
Chef Mellie in the building! Baked shrimp scampi and quinoa w/veggies on the menu tonight. #GoodFood
Just a few staple items... #Health and fitness. 
@theMedicis in actuality..quality, pure peanut butter (that I would actually eat is near 5-7$ (No Kraft BS here lol). Almond butter = 1$+
Oh, the possibilities in life are endless. #SuperMotivated
@theMedicis lol almond butter =) but the emphasis was on the celery sticks
Word of the day: Knowledge
(Knowledge is power.)
Celery sticks...
Almond butter and grape jelly &lt;3
#PacquiaoBradley2 (Photo via Reuters) 
Woohoo!!!
The China trap... I must start making my own clothing among many other things. -_-
Word of the day: Communication
(Communication is key.)
We are all equal beings. We all have a purpose.
Who's to say who's time is more precious than the others?
All I can do is try with a person, have patience with someone...till the day I just say screw it; not worth it. Their loss, not mine.
They come and go. They come and go...
#coachella ...NEXT YEAR. It's a must.
Happy Friday all! Can't wait for the weekend. =) #LoveLife #BeHappy

Idk what's going on with the ingredients farmers are using nowadays lol...but this is pretty cute #BunnyBerry 
Something you realize throughout life with those you feel are closest such as good friends (who you see as fam) and sadly, your blood fam.
At some point of being giving and very kind/caring to others you cross that line that separates hoping to be appreciated and just being used
La la la la la la feeling good

There's a difference between expressing your "interest" in someone and their life events and "interrogating" them on their life events.
this fucking misguided creature.... 
thinking about a world in which people use the internet and social media for education and not other nonsensical activities #WishfulThinking

The levels that social media can take you to .... smfh I've seen MORE than enough that makes me want to lock myself off from everyone...
The amount of things I've read and watched tonight have me so confused, worried and irritated for the world in it's current state.
Pondering life, sipping wine. #MyNightOff

...#WhoAreYou?? Then what happens if you're proud ass doesn't graduate or get the job you "so much" deserve huh? #KarmaIsABitch
...just because you can afford to be in school or that's you're personal choice that doesn't mean you should down anyone cuz they're not..
I'm sick of certain people thinking because they go to school/uni that they're the shit and much better than the whole damn world...

why is that...the more you fall for someone, everyone decides to fall for you? LOL -_-
we need to RESPECT and VALUE the lives we have been given
A first love, is a first love...you're gonna have love for them, that doesn't mean you can't love again. #mythoughts #random
I do NOT believe you only have ONE love/one SHOT at love. I believe you may have ONE that you will ALWAYS love, but that's about it.
@Seven_Chakras lol yeah i was up all night, it's what i do :$
A broken heart is just another battle scar....it doesn't stop your heart from beating. At least-- it shouldn't.
I believe that if something is broken, it can be fixed. Just super glue that shit back together or get someone else to help with you.
Need a NICE workout asap! #physicallyfit
When you realize someone's true mentality sometimes...makes you just wanna... push them to the side. Please, grow the heck up. -_-
OKAY! Time for bed =/

FUCK these movies...makin' love look all easy and shit lol #bereal
@DiverseThought be it absolutely nothing or something (y)
@DiverseThought LOL shame on you! *tsk tsk* shit happens though we can always just hope the receiver can handle what they're given.
@DiverseThought if you're unsure of your intentions, let the woman know don't keep it stringing and don't make it look fancier than it is
@DiverseThought if you say nothing she thinks nothing of you and is a) either emotionally torn...or b) a solider and keeps it moving
@DiverseThought ...if you choose to respond be wise, don't give false hope but dear truth. (as best as you can)
confident without cockiness...but enough to know that you're good with yourself in ANY given situation...don't depend on ANYONE
the problem with people nowadays...is there either too COCKY or too damn self conscious...the goal is to find a balance in between
lol if a chick msgs, you read and say nothing...her thoughts are that u think nothing (of her or her words)....so she keeps it moving #ijs
my ears are having an eargasm - #np The Weeknd - The Party &amp; the After Party ... #wow
@StefaniaSizzle HIIII, FUCK YOU. =)
#YouGetPointsIf your name is CASSIDY and you just lyrically murdered Meek hahaha (y) WOO!

@Seven_Chakras not a problem! :p
@Seven_Chakras lol my bad! I got u next time haha
@DiverseThought fattayyy :p
@DiverseThought of course it is. Still a skinny man with a fat appetite I see. Well done :) lol!
@DiverseThought hmmm touché my friend, the "as they are" felt incomplete to me lol. As you were then... With yo chinese food + walking dead
@DiverseThought incorrect. They shouldn't accept it if they are able to change what they're complaining about..which in MOST cases, they are

It affects your habits, decisions, reactions to certain things and situations. #realtalk!
I would never judge you from your past but just understand that your past makes you who you are today.
