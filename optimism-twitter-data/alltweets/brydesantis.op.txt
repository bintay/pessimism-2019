@Sean_Malcolm @JohnGotty @SportsNation ha funny but one was start of legend other was bullshit prayer bank shot
I mean let's call a spade a spade LBJ got hammered and missed a tough layup then Rose throws up a prayer he's the hero bron the goat? Plz
People calling that rose shot clutch? Ok that was a prayer accident bank shot
That's some bullshit man
@stach34 shocked that didn't happen to Browns pick ha
The fact that the NFL even has rules about regulation inflation on a football tells you they have wayyyy too many rules as it is
And that's coming from an unabashed hater of all things Boston never seen a non story get so much run again I blame Goodell
Media trying to make this out like its baseball steroid era some balls were under inflated who the hell cares
Seriously wasn't this story beat to death before super bowl? I still don't see what it matters whether Brady knew or not he's still got 4
Is there less than zero f$&amp;@s to give? Because if there is that's what I give about deflategate get over it who f'n cares!!!!!
@BHOOLZ no wr in first two rounds, Chris Berman
Dat downtown lyfe with @jrjanko should be fun catching game 4 down there #beatdabulls #drosekeepchucking
@walkswillhaunt @clevenatigirl haha yep it's on then
@walkswillhaunt desperate times
@JackKraszewski1 he can hit major league pitching he started slow been getting better he's probably frustrated
Just flip flop them let Ramirez get some confidence back at AAA
And memo to Indians time for Lindor seriously stop messing around Ramirez has been awful and he's looking over his shoulder
@walkswillhaunt still holding out hope starters too good for this slump and team starting to hit need a long homestand and w/ good Weather
Bruce Chen to start for Indians this weekend now I'm officially "concerned" ...and we lost yet another series
@Clio_the_Leo man I hope so I still can't figure out what the hell Bruno was thinking? Dumbest game move I've seen in years
@bradbgsu yeah like I said not a huge foos fan but they have some good stuff and no doubting their popularity and longetivity
@bradbgsu I'd say grohl pearl jam been off the boil for awhile
@bradbgsu she is a piece of shit not a good human being
@bradbgsu grohl was smart to lay off that China white unlike Kurt and Courtney
@bradbgsu did you see that montage of heck documentary about nirvana yet? It was pretty awesome
@StandOutFT Fitless is one of my fav tracks ever! Was that just a 12" single or part of an lp? Looking for it on wax
@bradbgsu I can't argue that he's part of two of the biggest bands of the era and on a personal level he seems like a genuine good dude
@bradbgsu I'm not a huge foos fan but he's talented and stepped out of Kurt shadow why?
@Clio_the_Leo did they do the HOH comp yet?

Austin Rivers
Glen Davis
Hedo Turkoglu
Lester Hudson
Dahnt…
@Kern829 original although borders was probably cooked about 10 years ago to be fair so D Rose has that going for him
@Kern829 yep shit was all good five years ago
I loved goading Chicago dude in front of me he actually wanted d rose to shoot jumpers that dude is borders books
I just saw a guy leave in d wade heat jersey I would have loved to ask what the logic is on that at a Cavs Bulls playoff game
And d rose can keep shooting all he wants
Noah is just a shit Tristan Thompson
TT boy that is all
That half didn't suck
Lebron headband 50 tonight?
Shump face killa
Yep this is d rose I saw all year jumper looks more broke thank hammer
Dat Shump card yall
This first quarter is brought to you by makers mark #imready
@realroygbiff @Kern829 I have no doubt if "beach biff" was in attendance game 1 we would be up right now so biff is selfish #truth
@Kern829 @realroygbiff you should hang your head in shame! Shame!
@bradbgsu @Kern829 I'm not worried Rose and some Others shot out of their ass that is their A game and we still almost won
@realroygbiff @Kern829 dude I'm not bashing crowd trust me tickets are expensive just sounded really quiet in first half for playoff game
@Kern829 that's not just my opinion either numerous talking heads commented on that
@Kern829 it sounded dead on tv until the second half probably because they do that hype crowd routine at commercial breaks
@ejtoth @Mveezy79 I beez in the trap
@Mveezy79 @ejtoth pregame fireball and makers tho so I should be well in "the mood" come tipoff thanks to uber for my ride ha
@Mveezy79 @ejtoth from where I am sitting I would need my own bose sound system for you to hear it lol
Game 2 do or die crowd was flat game 1 I'm gonna do my best to bring it from the start
Wow that was a big time shot from butler what can you say
Need game 2 that's all
I know Shump got fouled but why is LBJ passing up an open 10 footer?
Ok LBJ getting dirty now let's go
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 haha easy Not over yet I think we are fine with split in first two
@JusAire for sure mostly on LBJ he looks really passive tonight
Kyrie wants this bad love what I'm seeing out of him and ps this is as good as Rose can play Kyrie still better
@ejtoth @bradbgsu yep attack mode time with him and Kyrie lets go!
@bradbgsu need Lbj to step up he's been way too passive we need his A game to win
We've been poor most of this game but the Bulls shooting unbelievably from field and end of shot clock heaves going down this can't keep up
@Chuck_Strangers chuckie got beats but his bars could be better #everyrapcritic #dope
@Kern829 he's made himself a lot of cheddar these last few weeks
Thompson has been awesome totally changed the game with his energy
Kyrie insane and TT is bodying fools
This lineup on floor right now is goig to have to play 40+ for us to win first two (Kyrie, LBJ, Moz, Shump, TT)
If James Jones can't make these open threes he is virtually worthless
Rose has been shooting well but last 3 minute Kyrie explosion looks like what Rose used to do pre knee issues
@TheReal_BRoss he's warming good call
Bruh Derrick Rose is shooting out of his ass this won't last him hitting these shots early May help us late
@ejtoth yep agreed on all points don't know what's up with crowd sound flat again! Players need that boost for home court
Miller to the glue factory please I don't want to see anymore of him made Dunleavy look like Steph Curry
@LydTheKidd nice is that West Creek?
@waltsmog37 can't believe they did it good for Cavs though I didn't want any part of spurs
@spursycob rather have Bentley in the squad than soldado
Outcome of that fight was so predictable fact remains Floyd is always a huge draw becuz he is great and he's an asshole we want to see lose
Onus was on Manny we all know Floyds game plan he is a master of defensive counter punching manny didn't do nearly enough to shake him
Browns get a Trojan nice Telfer can play too probably better than Dray and Barnidge haha
@peebs3 either Farmer/Pettine are football dinosaurs or they will start a rennaisance Andre deemed geniuses I know which said I'm on lol
@peebs3 I would say we would play double tights but we don't have any tight ends either
So the Browns still didn't draft a receiver at this point I think Farmer is just trolling us we haven't pickedreceiver since Benjamin 2012
@PudPhil i like when he said "I am always marlin hunting, i always have lines in the water" right after he banged hot dog # legend
@PudPhil PDS was awesome last night. hey babygirl come here
@PudPhil @ejtoth @bradbgsu no concidence that was our best year since 99?! We need guys who can get in the damn endzone right now we have 0
@TheReal_BRoss @ejtoth Yeah we need a TE badly and a pass rusher and pretty much anything else but linemen now haha
@ejtoth McCown, West, Crowell, Dray, Hartline, Bowe, Hawkins, Gabriel as is could be worst offense we have seen since 99 at least #gethelp
So I know Rome wasn't built in day but we have to get some offensive playmakers Just have a look at our depth chart on O we need help badly.
Had chance to sleep on draft, I think Browns did Ok last night. For one I am happy they didn't move picks, they identified guys drafted them
@mikeinparma not elite upside like others imo but certainly would help us
There goes Dorsett so after Strong that is it for top end WR
@peebs3 true but I was just thinking will we have a guy score more than 5tds? Mccown, Crowell, Dray, Hartline, Hawkins, Gabriel that's our o
@CoryMizer wasn't awful no but eventually we need some impact playmakers we can't get them all once we finally find a QB
@peebs3 @realroygbiff Brady Hoke
@Coachbp24 @realroygbiff he kind of digressed but has first round tools worth a gamble IMO
My farmer tweet didn't mean to be negative I just meant guys who are desperate to keep job usually gamble more with picks
@realroygbiff if we got a true 1 then hartline, Hawkins is not bad as 2-3 but without that we will struggle even aside from QB issues ha
@Kern829 big drop off after top 5 hoping we somehow get strong or guy from da u
@realroygbiff still that's why I thought good tkme to get wr then QB next year well hopefully they have one targeted in 2nd rd
@realroygbiff biff we have to score and we lost our best two previous weapons from a team that struggles to score last season
I get how important interior lines are but fact remains we have zero impact playmakers on offense...none eventually we have to find some
Judging from those picks clearly Farmer got a vote of confidence that he had another year right?
@ejtoth @Kern829 @realroygbiff it's cool we will have a sweet line to protect our shitty QB who has nobody to throw to #kiddingbutsortofnot
We have 3 pro bowl ol where has that gotten us?
I don't get it sorry
@Kern829 @PudPhil @realroygbiff @walkswillhaunt my concern with Gilbert is he's a dumbass but then again pac man jones stuck at cb so...
@tribebrowns @Kern829 @walkswillhaunt I'm not optimistic with him but would be happy to be proved wrong
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @walkswillhaunt his attitude stinks that Williams was pretty good and he was rookie street free agent!
@realroygbiff @Kern829 @walkswillhaunt based on what?
@PudPhil he is a looney toon I like when've punched himself in the helmet after every incompletion
@walkswillhaunt he was terrible last year we started two street free agents over him
@peebs3 @PudPhil @realroygbiff I'm just relieved we didn't trade down again and then I would have to have annual argument with peebs lol
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @peebs3 yeah easy biffer and we also traded down to take Wimbley instead #oops
I like Parker, Agholor and Strong, Perriman kind of scares me more unknown and heard his hands are dicey we've been down that road before
@realroygbiff I'm fine with it just saying defensive picks always considered safe we have missed on them too ha
@tribebrowns god I hope so he was a mess this year
Not gonna blast pick but remember when people said Gilbert was smart safe pick last year ahead of all those receivers? #justsaying
@Coachbp24 I'm ok but WR is our biggest need we need one at 19 we fd up last year passing on all the good ones
Don't hate Shelton pick as long as we get WR at 19 still some good ones there
@TheReal_BRoss our whole line was banged up though I think we will be fine when healthy
@mkomo42 this coming from guy who pronounced Kaepernick (cuh-purr-nick) at fantasy draft ha
Don't be cute just take Parker please for once Browns do the smart thing
If we trade down again my heads going to explode
@realroygbiff I'm cool with that as long as we get a wr at 19 we got burned last year passing on wrs can't do it again
@Kern829 who's not liking this trend of teams on there way out taking cheap shots
@Kern829 what happened? He had a locked arm situation with Greek last game almost got ugly then
@tribebrowns yep or we have to get Agholor, Strong or Perriman at 19
Can't we just give the Jets some washed up special team guys and our 19 for this pick? Worked for them on us
@ejtoth yep he was banged up most of year still was awesome and had to play every down with scholarship issues
Never saw a player with the motor as good as Williams he takes no downs off
Seriously Browns should offer both 1s for Williams see if it is enough he's best player in this draft
No Williams? What a mistake by last two teams
@mkomo42 being called out by you for grammar on Twitter on all time low
Shame on Chicago as well the boos weren't nearly loud enough for that a-hole
How does Goodell mispronounce Mariotta I hate that guy what a worthless muppet
@JackKraszewski1 ha yep heard the trop is sold out tonight
They had to search long and hard for those 3 Buccaneers fans in the crowd
@mkomo42 just live it up as long as you're good enough someone will take you haha
@ebendersays more important what dip did you use with them? That buffalo dip is the shit with them
Ugh I need this Donadio family to lose on the feud already this one jackass on this family drives me nuts
@mkomo42 then you probably would t get drafted no visits or workouts? #fail
@realroygbiff @ReignofTroy oh yea also just saw that The U hasn't had first rounder since 2005 that's shocking, wish we could get L Williams
@MLBastian same here I think we are around the same age 90s hip hop was the golden era! Keep up the good work btw
@MLBastian wow nice didnt know you were a true hip hop head that album is classic!
@theHurt_Locker @peebs3 seriously if i had to rank positions of need for Browns RB would be the absolute last need and by some distance
@peebs3 they need to do away with the cl dropouts entering in that is bullshit
@peebs3 I would like that
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @peebs3 @bradbgsu I like that idea as well but please take wr in first that's all I ask
@bradbgsu @realroygbiff @Kern829 @peebs3 I like strong from ASU a lot he's a beast
@Kern829 @bradbgsu @peebs3 we need an f-ing receiver if we don't take one in 1st I riot
@RNewrones ha that rocked they need a damn kit Kat blizzard dq sort it out!
@bradbgsu @Kern829 @peebs3 is something wrong with West and Crowell ignoring that we have two decent backs taking rb in 1st is idiotic
If Allen blows this again.....
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @peebs3 every time I see holla now I say it in creepy vl voice
@peebs3 @PudPhil @realroygbiff like dat tavern
@realroygbiff @peebs3 @PudPhil yeah agreed but not in first round we have glaring needs
@peebs3 @realroygbiff @PudPhil Mariotta then Kessler than Barrett it was written
@peebs3 @PudPhil I'm not wrong we just take the wrong QBs and the wrong other players as well lol
@peebs3 @PudPhil I think peebo is just trolling me although we have this same argument every year ha
@peebs3 @PudPhil Hundley sucks balls #fucla
@peebs3 @PudPhil our lines are the least of our problems and linemen don't score touchdowns
@PudPhil @peebs3 I know it's gonna cost more than 12 &amp; 19 tho but if we are truly thinking ol and DL with those picks I'm gonna barf
@PudPhil and we have thrown an unbelievable amount of shit at the wall over the last 15 years hahaha
@PudPhil exactly throw enough feces at the wall....
I know our run defense was bad but I think DT is one of our best positions. That was  down to injuries last year not talent, be a wasted pic
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu word is Jimmy is consulting with Charles Ramsey
@bradbgsu @peebs3 can't say I feel sorry for him he basically forced his move to LA #youmadeyourbed
I'm not completely sold on Mariotta but it beats Mccown or Manziel at this point why the hell not
If Browns rumors are true I'm all for it we can't win until we get a QB so go for it
@peebs3 @bradbgsu i saw you wearing your Chris Paul jersey yesterday Peebs
It's why zune failed too, who wants to start over their music library after they decide they don't want to pay for service anymore?
Sorry Jay but I don't see any pay music streaming site working. First off you are still borrowing the music
@bradbgsu Spurs just toying with them
#LobCity
@realroygbiff special was pretty good go to abc cleveland for extended Ramsey interview!
Haha too late, it really is way too easy to say something stupid on Twitter but I guess that's what makes it great in a way
Rockets Twitter account that is
You think person running Houston Rockets is still employed?
Set your DVR Charles Ramsey interview on abc after Amanda berry 20/20 special #deadgiveaway
@JamesCatullo @marissadesantis oh no! Yeah can't turn of the tv at the park bummer
@RyanKatzSports just have to drink more beer ha
So I haven't even gotten to any of my season ticket games for Tribe and we are out of the division race what a great decision lol
@RyanKatzSports I can't take much more of this we suck
Ugh Indians are killing me
@iamcormega I need to get Realness &amp; True Meaning on vinyl but the copies on second hand market crazy expensive, any chance either reissued?
@realroygbiff @ejtoth not gonna be easy but don't understand people jumping off bridge after Love injury east is still pretty terrible
Rose doesn't scare me he still can't shoot and he doesn't have same burst to beat people to rim he will have his days but not elite now
@Kern829 in all seriousness Henson isn't huge now but he's probably 30 lbs stronger than he was at unc he was a stick there
@Kern829 ha very true where is @bradbgsu to defend his boy Woy
@Kern829 never thought I'd see him and John f-ing Henson making big plays in an nba playoff game
Noah on the take? Dude can't make a layup tonight
@AvrgSportsPlays @Kern829 thanks now my new favorite Twitter follow haha
@Kern829 even better Bucks battling with Bulls again I think we still beat them without Love they can't score
@Kern829 true this is good though even with loss reinforces Atlanta doesn't scare me
@Kern829 he is abysmal never seen a guy lose it so quickly
@realroygbiff at this point I'm actually excited for his return never thought I'd say that either!
Ok I'm the biggest Tribe honk there is but this team is unwatchable at the moment something has to change and quickly
@bradbgsu yep we are fine
All that good will Jose Ramirez built up last season has disappeared should be Lindor time, team needs a spark badly
@ejtoth thanks blame that on the wife lol
The prize will get him in a Levin ad, and will win a grill. Since I have a nice grill I will auction off and donate proceeds to APL if I win
Hey ya'll vote for my dog to win Levin furniture contest ! &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="
@waltsmog37 ha didn't see that coming #spursin7
According to my wife JR Smith is totally int he right no suspension granted I think she is in love with him
@Kern829 @ejtoth i see what he was trying to do still annoying seen that movie before #lstephenson #deshawnstephenson
@Kern829 @ejtoth I didn't think Jae Crowder was a twat until this series new people prove to me they are assholes on a daily basis
@Kern829 @ejtoth pretty sure every criminal has to commit a first crime, not like there is huge track record on Olynyk
Need a vine of Blatt calling out Boston writers in his presser about how they had 2nd best record since AS break classic stuff
Don't worry Boston fans will never concede defeat but they will win next Super Bowl, Stanley Cup and World Series #noshortageofconfidence
@Kern829 that was awesome when he threw the Boston record after AS break back at Boston writers and...crickets and called them out on it
I feel same about Olynyk than with JR tbh was there intent to badly hurt? No, but it was cynical and "mischievous"
Brad Stevens is a good coach but how about David Blatt? Totally owned him in that series great adjustments of course he gets no credit
@Kern829 do you think that was ordered by Blatt? If so genius, I also love LBJ face during that he was loving it
Just watched Perkins incident again so awesome not only did he flatten him he gave him stinky finger and was asking Crowder to step hahaha
In other news Indians gave up another HR to Cabrera starting to question Tito logic only HR I would give up to him is Grand Slam #walkhim
@ebendersays what's fucking new, today Carrasco v Libstein we still lose what a disgrace
IMO one game suspension is about right for JR Smith he was baited it was reckless but to catch him in face don't think prove intentional
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 fwiw just heard Pretty Ricky Fox say it will be one game suspension he knows his way around suspensions
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 agreed Perkins move was favorite thing maybe ever Smith got goaded and bad officiating they always catch the 2nd guy
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 also way he reacted looked like wasn't first time seen some guys pop the shoulder back and get right back in game
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 no DR but looked like a straight dislocation on non shooting arm he should be fine barring ligament damage
Perkins gave the ref the Norman Dale (throw me out of this game please) still didn't get tossed, he even had the refs shook
@Kern829 guess 1 game the officiating was terrible they let Boston instigate all series this is what you get! Proud we took a stand tho
Does anybody think the clippers will win this game? Anyone? Bueller?
@Kern829 I am more worried about stopping Chicago inside and on glass and TT is better matchup against them imo
@Kern829 bring back Donyell Marshall! Seriously though gonna need more Kyrie,LBj think we will be fine
Stop with this curse bullshit we have two of the best players in the NBA we have every chance of winning this chip regardless of Love status
Shump Killah
@ejtoth he's Andre 3000 today
That play was scary foreshadowing with James Jones guarding any big on Chicago
Shumpert been everywhere today it's like there is 3 of him on the court ps thanks #knickstape
@Billy_Seuss @Kern829 is Andy close? I'm not happy about Love injury but not cutting up my title parade ticket if he's done for year
Will there be a Mike Miller sighting?
I get the logic of game 5 gets JR. Back (maybe) but I am more worried about keeping LBJ and Kyrie healthy and fresh #finishthem
@Kern829 yep awesome tonight out best player today by some distance
Two dirty plays on Thomas not reviewed that's garbage just because he's small he can't get a flagrant? Could have really hurt TT
This game has been awesome to watch it may hurt our long term title hopes but this is captivating 90s style bawse mode, Oakley is smiling!
Shump has been awesome today which is even more key as we may be without Love and JR for awhile
Ok this game needs to end this series is over as a competitive contest only bad things can happen from here out
@mdalakas Knicks vs Heat 90s style! Haha <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Watching on delay but what Perkins did was awesome! Exactly what we have him for
That lbj shot is incredible and the "gimme my money" comment to JR in mid flight is priceless
This Jenner special is captivating to me I give credit to BJ many unknown people probably feel the same #toeachhisown
@kelseywont ha that was good!
Indians logic Spring training/minor league options for shitty players&gt; big league production
Remember when I said it made no sense for House, Floyd or Mccalister to have spot in rotation over Salazar? Yeah for once I was very right
Brandon Moss doh.::: more of that please
Yo @realroygbiff this is when we go! Offensive explosion go Tribe!!!!
@ATTCares funny how I hear crickets from Verizon?? they can have  last month overpayment last penny I ever give them and reported to BBB
@VZWSupport my plan options I went to you guys 3 separate times and it was terrible prices 10 years of service and nothing to show thx
@VZWSupport followed I want my money back 10 years of service and I et charged $170 for 8 days of service
@ATTCares much appreciated can't express how satisfied I am already with service Uverse and mobile satisfied customer
Only the Indians can hit a pitcher in the back with a soft liner and still get doubled up
@VerizonWireless was thinking of coming back but you won't get another penny from me or my family hope you nothing but bankruptcy
@VerizonWireless you guys got 10k plus from me in last 10 years but needed that last $170 for month s vice charge of 8 days of use #joke
@JackKraszewski1 it's fine no problems certainly no difference from Verizon
@VerizonWireless worst company I've ever dealt with I am very happy to have switched to att gave you 10k but needed $170 for last bill
Never ever have heard of any business charging for a full month of service that wasn't used ridiculous especially forcompany of their size
Glad I switched from Verizon to att Verizon charging me for a full month service when I used 4 days FOH never get another dollar from me
@peebs3 agreed on that! I still want to see the fight but I REALLY wanted to see that fight about 3 years ago
I love how the Lean Cuisine I am eating for lunch says "freshly made pasta" on the box haha yep so fresh!! #stillgoodtho
Some of these TV shows wait too long for follow up movies. I loved Entourage but last few seasons were meh and I am kind of over it..
How good has Tristan Thompson been in this Celtics series? Making himself a lot of money!
Really starting to get concerned about Kipnis. Looking more and more like his 2013 was an anomaly. He doesn't drive the ball at all!
Good article regarding Indians leadership. Gomes seems to be the biggest leader doesn't help he is hurt  
My favorite part about that Cavs win was things got chippy and teammates had each other's backs
@realroygbiff true is about time! Also had a hard foul I like that even more
@MenInBlazers @NBCSportsSoccer HARRY KANE
Not surprised in the slightest San Antonio won in LA, I still think they are the team to beat in the West. Not their first rodeo
@EvelDick when will the new DAN episode be up? I am excited last night was crazy #JPthedumbass
@theHurt_Locker He should go back there he isn't good enough to play at a major!
@realroygbiff didn't announce yet where but dumb decision on his part he's an undersized big not going to play at major program
Now CSU losing Anton Grady as a fifth year senior. NCAA really needs to change this rule. It is killing mid major programs
@tribebrowns @TheReal_BRoss ha I feel the same with current ownership/management I feel we have no hope doesn't matter who we pick
Can't believe NFL draft is next week haven't had less interest in one in years and the league ruined the draft moving it off of Saturdays
@realroygbiff @Mveezy79 don't forget Zack Walters #instantoffense
@realroygbiff @Mveezy79 we have scored 5 runs in 4 starts for Kluber that is pathetic
@realroygbiff @Mveezy79 agree this is bad look how many quality starts we have wasted already every team seems to score but us!
@Beeskal Nagy threw puss and won games with a 5 ERA because we had a softball team ha
@petemally I would agree though that length of time Omar was with us carries weight I love Omar too btw just don't rate him near top 4 at
@Beeskal Belle had 5 straight years of over 35 HR and 110 RBI!
@petemally Belle had 5 straight years of over 35 HR and over 110 RBI!
Sabathia won 107 games for Tribe with 3.5 era that's pretty remarkable especially in Steroid era
@bradbgsu thome is only one who should be on all time even that a stretch sorry doby not averill is the 4th and that is valid
@bradbgsu thome is on the 4 now currently thome, feller, averill and Vizquel I agree with your rankings and would have lofton over Omar too
@petemally still would take belle and Ramirez they finished high in mvp votes multiple years defense was spectacular but .284 is average
I love Omar Vizquel but he doesn't sniff top 4 Indians of all time that's a joke even in recent era I would rate CC, Belle and Ramirez higer
@Mveezy79 @realroygbiff samardzja is overrated 24-40 overall as a starter we can't hit off Jeremy sowers right now
Indians lineup today: Hitters above .250 = 0 Hitters below .200 = 5 #nowords #onlywayisup
@theHurt_Locker no that is face value through Cavs
@PudPhil I also forgot about the uber guy picking me up in a Lexus and making him stop at Taco Bell while @Mveezy79 slept in the car hahaha
@PudPhil nope everyone goes to that English Pube place was HOT and poppin!
@cavs @NBA  these playoff ticket prices are ridiculous, pricing out 95% of our fanbase
@PudPhil we never had that luck in Florida just got some foreigners who couldn't speak English or even knew where the hell they were going!
Was just looking lower level seats behind basket way up are $200 a piece that is insane! those seats aren't even that good
@PudPhil maybe you will get lucky and a marlin will pick you up!
Just went on Cavs site you can get tickets for game 3 right now if you like promo code: 6SVQB   I am sitting this out too expensive!!!
@PudPhil ha no I am just looking to scoop some free rides. If I wasn't leasing I would totally drive people around blaring WU TANG
Seriously though cab companies are going to die out uber or lyft is so much more dependable and cheaper what a great concept
If you haven't used Uber you should! If you do use this promo code "bryand675" and both you and I will get a free ride. #holla
@PudPhil that's a tentative plan pending wife Job situation will holla when I get more details
Brantley and cavs and Tottenham in Colorado  it's all good @PudPhil coming to you in July marlin slayer
We are clearly just coasting but part of me likes us toying with Boston hearts a number of them think they have a legit chance #blessthem
That alley oop doh damn
So I guess I will call out Kevin love every playoff and from here ou at halftime it's working lol
#together size 11 section 205 row 13 seat 8 #ALLforCLE
Well love had been terrible again tis half unfortunately we go as he goes and we need a regroup like last game
@PudPhil did you see daddy wearing shirt this week on pds that said marlin slayer? You need that asap
In uber just saw lbj going to park in a sick black Bentley ha
Pre game Cavs vinyl selection important thinking some old school Mobb 
Freddie Gibbs is rapidly climbing up my list of favorite MC's
Can't wait to #turnup at Cavs playoff game tonight!!!! Look for me on TV i will be the one in the rafters lol
@realroygbiff @Coachbp24 I tweeted that after first half he was awful second half he was great need more like that please
Kyrie absurd  so good!
Who would have thought James Jones signing would have been more important than Mike Miller signing?
Crowd is really flat today cmon cleveland step yo game up!
Alright that's better two tough finishes inside from Love! That's what we need that toughness
@spursycob @pokeefe1 @BenPearceSpurs get rid ASAP he's a terrible fit for our league and doesn't look up to it mentally either
From what I've seen Kyrie amazing, TT very good and underrated Love terrible so par for the course really ha go Cavs!!!
Josh Smith is a terrible basketball player
@JackKraszewski1 he only has one pitch and it doesn't move either not fooling major leaguers
This is most bizarre inning I've ever seen and still only 1 out! Only one hard hit ball 6 base runners
This inning had been a calamity of defensive errors I thought we fixed this?
Money has never been an issue with Cubs that decision was baffling. They just spent 200m on pitching but worried about his arbitration clock
The fact that Kris Bryant was called up and put right into cleanup spot shows how ridiculous of a decision to not start season in Chicago
@realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 @mkomo42 @ejtoth @ebendersays agreed, never heard anyone say Madonna sucked but that bassist was killer
@JackKraszewski1 @mkomo42 @realroygbiff @ejtoth @ebendersays great twitter debate ha imo performers always sound better w/band backup singer
@JackKraszewski1 @realroygbiff @ejtoth @ebendersays @common slightly Overserved.
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @Mveezy79 @peebs3 he's amazing ha gonna put that ass in a pretzel baby girl
@realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 @ejtoth @ebendersays oops misread under then we will see exactly three terrible quarterbacks next year
@JackKraszewski1 @realroygbiff @ejtoth @ebendersays push but guarantee we see 3 we have for like 10 years now which is comical/sad/pathetic
@JackKraszewski1 @common ha true having wifi issues

@common show at wolstein awesome! best $5 concert I've ever seen even went back in the catalog for some classics!

Wow as if Tribe needed another injury Carrasco hit in the face with line shot won't see him for awhile luckily he looked ok walking at leas
@mkomo42 I will resume this year smartass ha
@realroygbiff @ejtoth it's stupid tradition is what I like in uniforms don't see packers, Cowboys or steelers changing unis
Shits I give about new Browns uniforms <DIGIT ZERO + COMBINING ENCLOSING KEYCAP>
This is hilarious best Price is Right contestant ever 
Are all dogs born with a hate for mailmen? My dog won't bark at anyone coming to our door but the mailman he goes ballistic ha
@walkswillhaunt looks like Boston, can't be nervous for that right?
@CoryMizer yeah i feel ya, i wanted to get to at least 1 playoff game and the prices go up each round so i just pulled the trigger
Granted my seats are really crappy, still for playoffs i am cool with it ha
scored Cavs playoff tickets for home game 2 just now holla!!!
@realroygbiff it's awesome seriously they did an amazing job
Can't wait for all who haven't the new bar/corner area in right field it is awesome truly no need to buy other tix 
@realroygbiff so is their 5,6 jd Martinez and cespedes ouch you have to now down 7 to 2 hitters to have a chance
This tiger team is built like Indians teams of 90's they won't win in playoffs but should cruise through regular season offense is nuts
Bourn stealing bases this is good must be that new j cole at bat music
@realroygbiff Anello via @jrjanko amazing seats

Great seats unfortunately things have escalated quickly lol
@mikeinparma I like the extra matches and sick of this 4th place or nothing attitude it's very unlikely in current epl landscape
@mikeinparma never understand some people that want us knocked out of cup comps for what? This shit? Ha
This is going to be long end of season for us Spurs fans we look dire and uninterested...again good thing we are out of Europe <UNAMUSED FACE>
Kluber vs Price tomorrow 4:05 on to the next one roll tribe!
Murphy has to catch that cmon we wear caps and sleeves on this level son
Knee jerk reaction but our defense today has been horrendous this can't continue if we are serious
Is this going to be another year where everyone talks about how terrible tigers bullpen is and we can't touch them?
Opening day is here! Heading downtown in about an hour and a half #turnup
Haha I love Indians Twitter trolling Sto Twitter for jinxing the no no
I blame Tito don't give a shit about save situation have to go to Allen in 9th
@tribebrowns fuck him
@CoryMizer same as Moss for us ha
@peebs3 do you not cherish tradition of GlC
@CoryMizer @Indians it's terrible sort it out?!!
Sportstime Ohio trying to troll this no hitter? No need for the graphic on the screen we know #holyjinx
@realroygbiff yep may want to find Lindor a new position
Tribe starters as advertised so far if we can get some consistent offense team can be scary good
Another sad day to be a Browns game no GLC this preseason smh
Trevor Bauer turning this into a little league game walk or strikeout #nodefensenecesarry
@JackKraszewski1 @mkomo42 it does suck but reality is CSU relies heavily on transfers in from other schools and Trey better shot at NBA ther
@JackKraszewski1 @realroygbiff @mkomo42 I can't really blame him he graduated free transfer is the rule gonna be a rough year for Vikes
Thank you Carlos Santana! 13 scoreless innings against the Astros was certainly not necessary
@bradbgsu yep although I have much more faith in kipnis returning to form than swisher although swish is better than Raburn
Kipnis interview in mlb network was awesome he is a great character now let's get him back to raking
Ryan Rayburn days better be numbered here he's terrible
Man it's fun watching Kluber pitch dude is filthy
@realroygbiff I called mlb last year I said so you are telling me I can literally not stream audio for an Indians game in Cleveland #fail
@realroygbiff yes and they blackout Indians games even if you payI looked into it last year it's ridiculous I can't get reception at work
@realroygbiff some copyright bullshit mlb doesn't allow get an old school radio
Tribe time boom! Haven't been this excited for baseball season in a long time. Season of glory #RollTribe
@mkomo42 I think Sunday at 7 but may move it to get more time
@walkswillhaunt thanks I have Sparty to beat cards too which I think has a good chance at happening
8 out of 8 in my bracket for elite 8 never done that before #OneShiningMoment
Verne oh gosh oh gosh
@PudPhil @realroygbiff yeah they "compare" to Gillette fusion but a week old fusion is better than brand new shave club knockoff
I liked the idea of dollar shave club unfortunately their razors suck
@PudPhil @Mveezy79 @realroygbiff @peebs3 20 shots a day keeps the grim reaper away
@Mveezy79 @PudPhil @realroygbiff @peebs3 eating a nice salad for lunch jut had to let you know Phyl haha
Talking about Xavier that is can they go to another elite 8?
Most underrated program in America many so called powers would kill to have their tournament resume over last 15 years
Holy backdoor cover batman that's a brutal loss if you're on heels
Way to wait an extra possession to call a timeout Woy
@bradbgsu @Kern829 no chance
Heels shooting out of their skin only up 1 this will get ugly me thinks
Nice defense by Roys boys this is a layup line for Wisconsin
My puppy got his first taste of steak he is going nuts now licking the ground trying to find more haha #justlikehisdaddy
Man Wichita state missing a ton of layups
@peebs3 @realroygbiff @PudPhil @Mveezy79 that looks awesome actually can't wait to see Daddy slat Marlins on party down south tonight
The jersey on backwards is a nice touch
That Mozgov commercial maybe the best thing I have ever seen, I can't stop watching it hahahahaha
Cavs look scary good right now, everything is gelling. We will be a tough team to beat 4 times out of 7 is THIS the year? maybe my friends..
Pretty cool how England squad is all Tottenham now, 5 players soon to be 6 with Dier shortly #futureislilywhite
@peebs3 @PudPhil @realroygbiff @Mveezy79 Phyl how many tinder "HIKING DATES" have you set up this week?
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @peebs3 @Mveezy79 anywhere that sells beer won't keep costs down for us lol
Just further proof of how NCAA screwed over USC 
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @peebs3 @Mveezy79 @Slivo23 would love spring training I've always waned to go!
@danbender45 @MGoods7 ha no I gave up on that show a few seasons ago but I am curious who it is
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @peebs3 @Mveezy79 how is the tinder game in Denver?
@realroygbiff @PudPhil @peebs3 @Mveezy79 funniest  biff looked like he wanted to kill waitress when she asked if wanted salad w/everything
@marissadesantis wow that is awesome! i hope so
Florida was a blast and I will miss this weather but also looking forward to getting back home I miss that 20 degree weather!
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @Mveezy79 @peebs3 I have your bathing suit will mail to you
Bearcats!!!!!!
Just blaze!!!
@MicrosoftHelps I had to refresh my pc I hope this works if I lose all my files I'm going to cry
@realroygbiff @theHurt_Locker i think @JackKraszewski1 is out because i am not doing an innings pitched max
Thanks windows for a pointless update that has now f'd up my laptop.
@theHurt_Locker i figured it out ha
@BasilTeen yeah we can go to 12 teams and a few said they may drop out
Can the Cavs just concede this game and save the effort #fatigue
Thursday locks butler, smu, Georgia state and vcu
@peebs3 where it at fool
@realroygbiff yep and if that stomp happened today he would have gotten ejected &amp;retroactive ban for sure. "That" shot never happens
Just watched Laettner 30 for 30.could you imagine if he stomped on dude chest and didn't get ejected then hit game winner in Twitter age?!
Pretty cool Indians opening up stadium tomorrow I've said before they get least support but are the most fan friendly in town by far
Also with all things being equal on a lot of resumes how does Temple beating Kansas by 25 get dismissed? I really don't get the logic
If the NCAA used "the eye test" to put UCLA in the field over Murray State they need new eyes
Seeding a joke as usual how is Dayton an 11 play in? Texas was ranked higher than them by committee? Um ok
This dude Purvis from Uconn has the best facial expressions ever
Who designs Adidas uniforms? It's a debacle what they throw athletes in now
Raftery da god doing big 10 games is crap not the same should be doing seton hall v providence with random shouts to interest me
How's Ben Stiller gonna make 5 sequels to Night at Museum and not 1 to Heartbreak Kid? sort that out bruh
@BigMill38 @realroygbiff thing that sucks is it cost us Clay as well, Jim Dray day time lol #2-14
Actively avoiding Browns news and this I guess is why...heard he re-signed with Browns yesterday now I see on twitter he is a Dolphin lmao
that kyrie fella had a decent game last night
@Kern829 just saw your text Kyrie Vega haha
@Clevelanderboat @NathanZegura @Browns we are a joke, laughing stock of the league
I can't stop watching that lady get cracked in face by basketball. Nothing is more annoying than people in great seats not watching game
@PudPhil yeah and then losing the players after 3 years to FA, that's if they are any good what a great plan haha
@walkswillhaunt yeah like that was ever going to happen ha and it is one position where we aren't in desperate need either
Jabaal Sheard gone tell me why Browns were looking forward to free agency? We are just losing good players and not signing anyone new
Too many other conferences the top teams just go through the motions don't care, if we lose oh well. ACC for instance always been a dud
The old Big East tournament was special different from all the others it was like a mini NCAA tourney EVERYONE wanted to win that
Got that new iphone 6 last night, don't see many differences from the 5 to be honest and not sure if I like how much bigger it is
@JackKraszewski1 yes name too long sorry ha
@bankruptspurs @SpursOfficial I suppose Soldado's "clever" flicks don't do too well in keep-ball
Ha just read Browns trying to sway Locker out of retirement, this will probably end up like Grossman. #gonefishin
Likely opening day lineup

Bourn CF
Kipnis 2b
Brantley LF
Santana 1B
Moss RF
Gomes C
Chisenhall 3B
Murphy DH
Ramirez SS

#playoffs
So w/ Floyd done we are right back where we ended last season  rotation. (and thats a good thing) Kluber, Carrasco, Bauer, Salazar, House
@Kern829 he hasn't had concussion problems just some random various other injuries. Nothing major though, really weird

@walkswillhaunt bizarre yes but par for the course for Browns
Jake Locker just was like nah I'm good. what a weird day in NFL.
Do Browns know that building a team around running game and defense is a recipe for mediocrity (at best) this isn't 1984
@Kern829 for real? oh my
@bradbgsu @ejtoth @danbender45 @mkomo42 @Kern829 @peebs3 this Friday 3 at Parma Tavern? #conftourneyakshun
Pulled the trigger on 20 game Tribe season tickets, gonna be a fun year! #RollTribe @Indians
Leggooo 
NFL is going crazy right now never seen this many big trades before! farmer probably busy texting Haslam #stooges
@jjoeb17 ha conversate with him or whatever you call it he's left thankfully
Part of me wants to shout out correct answers I know to jeopardy but I'm scared to engage this dude
@ejtoth jimmy graham to Seahawks I bet @Mattvonlehmden can't wait to take him first overall again hahaha
Waiting for oil change some creepy guy is shouting out incorrect answers to jeopardy and burping intermittently #wtf
Taco Bell would introduce a sriacha quesarito when I gave up fast food for lent #ineedit
Ohio well represented in NCAA tourney as usual: Ohio St., Dayton, Cincinnati, Xavier and probably a MAC school
Gavin Floyd done then? That didn't take long, but not too bothered. I was baffled they just handed him a spot in rotation #balldontlie
@tribebrowns speaking of Gregory how did he even get that job? His teams underachieved every year at Dayton he's a hack
@tribebrowns Jim Christian makes it a wash! but I also failed to do homework GT missing their only good player
@ejtoth Travis Benjamin got next
Why would Frank Gore go to Indy? I mean they have Trent Richardson?
Watching BC v Ga Tech these are two awful basketball teams but nonetheless the madness is under way! #GaTEch+3
Yo apple is it necessary to have an Itunes updated version every week? sort it out wtf
@bradbgsu yes they were silly, just checked they scored over 100 points 14 times that year! In a 40 minute college basketball game! unreal
@bradbgsu UNLV was best I ever saw they beat everyone by 30 Augmon, LJ, Hunt, Anthony woowee
Hey Liam, I have a fresh new script for you..You are an assassin avenging your child being kidnapped you want in? #showmethemoney
@bradbgsu @peebs3 @realroygbiff can't fault him but I am surprised Taken has turned into Final Destination, Fast &amp; Furious type levels
@peebs3 @realroygbiff @bradbgsu from the trailer it appears it is the same movie as Taken but this time he lost his son, as Brad says CTC
@realroygbiff @bradbgsu I wonder if Maggie Grace is running like a tard in this movie? how can someone so hot look so ridiculous?
@peebs3 @bradbgsu Valpo is legit, GB is a one man team
@bradbgsu I just saw trailer for a new movie it looks exactly like all takens he's on the run and will hunt you down!!
Liam Neeson is just taking the piss now with these movies
I know the "experts" claim Murray State will miss out on tourney but I cannot see a team who won 25 of last 26 left out no way if so tragedy
@Kern829 dagger what a shame they had a good squad
@Kern829 damn gate not happening today
One week from today selection Sunday holla
Tim donaghy was child's play compared to what you see from refs in horizon and Mac level conf young lads who give a f do a case study
@brydesantis @tribebrowns @ejtoth @TheReal_BRoss @LittleOhio @markross330 doctor prescribed of course #sorethroat #codeineinmycup #jamarcus
@tribebrowns @ejtoth @TheReal_BRoss @LittleOhio @markross330 be Josh Gordon with a fifth of lean and sprite
@tribebrowns @ejtoth @TheReal_BRoss @LittleOhio @markross330 word on street is b Ross picking up johnny from vista rehab otherwise it will..
@tribebrowns ha bad loss for Archie today but it's a joke they are considered bubble easily should be 5 seed or higher the rankings joke
@tribebrowns you forgot Josh Pastner worst coach I've ever seen always with a top 10 class
@tribebrowns oh Christ Barnes is worst than crean than woy
@JackKraszewski1 only have ourselves to blame some terrible losses and not host but that's why so hard to get road wins in horizon
@JackKraszewski1 that was worst call I've ever seen
@mkomo42 they on espnu
@mkomo42 poor service deserves poor tip poor food choice not server fault
Roy Williams doing his best Roy Williams look #befuddled #garbagecoach
@ejtoth authorities have been notified tread lightly
@ejtoth I reported you for not tipping t bell for stealing their hot sauce haha
@ejtoth no unless exceptional extras given you did the hard work
@peebs3 yes I just overheard this at cup final last week and it's legit take the bottom line scroll with you #familyandfriendsonly
That being said we overtip bartenders in USA why should I pay someone an extra 20% to take a beer cap of a bottle?
Hear people say this Place was so expensive I didn't want to tip after paying X amount for food? Then go to Friday's muppet
Nothing bothers me more than poor tippers, u don't like food not servers fault u picked your restaurant and entree bruh
@peebs3 I like this new espnw channel A) I don't get it on my cable B) get that shit off my guide and keep it to the 10 people who care
@mkomo42 new year new day
This is such a travesty conference tourney should be at wolstein in
Cleveland instead at gym size of midpark in Bumf£€% Indiana
Just heard Tennessee women's hoops player dedicate win to "the haters" is there really anyone who cares enough to hate a women's hoop team?
@peebs3 @mkomo42 @realroygbiff dat TV doh
@mkomo42 @realroygbiff @peebs3 so vikes have no chance right? Head says no heart says 2 losses by combined 5 points #statslie
@clevenatigirl @walkswillhaunt what an asshat #amateurhour #boldflavors
@mkomo42 how does ud lose to Lasalle dagger bruh
@peebs3 haven't looked today Tuesday the locks should start flowing conf tourneys baby
@mkomo42 you know it harry Kane is legend! Now to hoops
@mkomo42 yeah round 2 is a b though at valpo probably night night for vikes
So LBJ is our enforcer now too?
@ejtoth soft bruh
Again we need Perkins or somebody to come I now and lay out Teague or Schroeder LBJ taking way too many hard fouls lately becoming a trend
Game blouses.
Re: Kevin Love mama said if you have nothing nice to say....
@BillyBobBall @Clevelanderboat he is hilarious so yeah there you go
@Clevelanderboat he's the best clinger on in NBA history went from bff with Shaq to wade to LBJ
@CSUSID great thanks go vikes!
@CSUSID any TV for this game or live stream?
Seriously is Damon Jones on cavs payroll? Or just LBJ entourage member with on bench privileges? Serious question
That was awesome JR Smith gets hammered regroups fadeaway trey love that boi refs doing us no favora
@Kern829 so money I need to see the throwback nets "cloud" jerseys from d Coleman era
Seriously this Schroeder is awesome to watch gonna be a star
That Schroeder is nice and the skunk tip fade is an added bonus
Seriously LBJ is going Knoblauch on his free throws is it that phantom elbow injury recurring? #yips
Love seeing Luda next to Hawks bench #ohnafightsout
@peebs3 @realroygbiff @PudPhil @Mveezy79 not scared hoping to see some gators and snakes holla
@mkomo42 just wait til football season
@Kern829 @DavidZavac had to be his thinking but still not sure it's a long term answer we aren't gonna hit threes like this every game
@cilvaringz1 when's your album drop?
Well it's worked because we are draining some incredibly tough 3's
I can't begin to try to understand Blatts rotation end of this game but it has worked so there's that
Da U
NBA officials are horrendous they have no consistency whatsoever
De f$&amp;@ is Mozgov?
@CoryMizer he's terrible we sorely need a real backup pg
That was the worst foul call I've ever seen 3 shots for a bump on the floor ok
@david_king_AU yep put him in
@CoryMizer yep put him in now
@TheReal_BRoss couldn't agree more f a win sending message more important
Love LBJ response there though a younger Lebron would have laughed it off now not having it
Where's oakley when you need him
Somebody has to send a message to the raptors Mozgov? They really trying to bully us
Ok Love I feel ya tonight
@MikeAndMike @TheReal_BRoss @Espngreeny HAHAHA good luck with that bruh
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu think I like the 6 start tough to make after work BUT i was down for some April gms last year &amp; its freezing late
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu i would say it's pretty close under (slightly)
@JackKraszewski1 oh yeah oops apr 14
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu love that game,would have to say Royals, he caused me many a frustrating night whiffing 6 guys with 82 mph heater
I did get a pair of lower reserves for Tuesday April 7 and comes with a free beer not bad for $20 a piece #RollTribe
@bradbgsu @walkswillhaunt we just signed Bruce Chen he is the Elvis Presley of puss throwing lefties
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu yep if they were smart they would make you buy 2 to other April game in order to buy OD would weed out a lot
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu i was just looking for SRO no luck there either oh well
@walkswillhaunt ok let me know if you are in for sure and i will grab 4
@bradbgsu got shut out, will have to wait and see what the secondary market holds but not paying $60 a piece to sit in the damn bleachers
@walkswillhaunt which game would you be looking for i can grab some seats
@JackKraszewski1 @CoryMizer crap i couldn't get any only got offered field box seats for $150 a piece forget that
@JackKraszewski1 @CoryMizer @Indians how are you getting them offered? i thoguht it was sold out
Well that sucks haven't missed a home opener since 2002 but looks like that streak will be broken
@Indians I don't believe how I could get shut out of opening day tickets getting in at 10:01 what the hell?
What the bloody hell, I had to be one of the first ones in to buy and still got shut out of opening day tickets?!
Musberger has been doing that for years I am surprised he hasn't gotten in trouble for it #helovesabet
@CoryMizer I work in Brookpark but still have to go home wait for wife to drive together 6 is pushing it esp. parking at that time
@CoryMizer @Indians possibly good point, I guess it would be warmer in April &amp; May too but hard to get down in time after work
@monishka2011 yep
@Indians What is the deal with these 6pm start times? is this correct?
Indians ticket password is KLUBER go buy tickets at 10 AM support a winner! #RollTribe
@CoryMizer yeah it is very sad that I am excited it may hit 40 tomorrow
This weather is physically draining, I can't wait for the day I walk outside and am not hit with an uppercut of frigid cold air maybe in May
@walkswillhaunt yeah that would work, i don't understand why he plays at all he brings absolutely nothing positive to the table
@CoryMizer thanks you going to opening day? I am trying to erase yesterday ever happened
My puppy has strict instructions to kill on site next time
Yesterday sucked, somehow a bird was in my basement flying around taking dumps on my brand new carpet that was fun trying to catch him
@Indians registered for the online onsale but what time tomorrow do tickets go on sale?
@walkswillhaunt forgot to mention another stellar performance by Jermaine Sanders Saturday 0-4 with 2 "recliner" bricks from three
@bradbgsu @walkswillhaunt lost season? they will still be dancing and that's a decent feat considering a transition year
@Kern829 @terrypluto haha they know first comment respect
@KenCarman @Draino3112 he's a better rebounding version of donyell marshall stretch fours cost a ton these days
@KenCarman swisher thinks love is overpaid #lethimwalk
@ChrisFedor probably cause he's soft as f and needed a break #lethimwalk
Gutted just gutted
@Kern829 @bradbgsu bk that's blasphemy
@walkswillhaunt @bradbgsu cincy has to get back in there the American is garbage
@bradbgsu always it's still the best conference don't try and tell me otherwise
Fx is usually on point with its shows but that Man Seeking Woman show is the dumbest thing I've ever seen
This win should put Johnies in the field gotta love that 6 big east teams
@mkomo42 too much smut
Oh sweet Matthew Perry has a new sitcom I'm sure THIS will be the one that's a hit #nevergiveup
@peebs3 I would be quiet because Liam will find you and he will kill you #thingsivelearned
@peebs3 @Kern829 Mitch McGary had 20 and 9 for thunder last night where did that come from
@peebs3 @Kern829 cj McCollum he gets burn for Blazers
@Forch_21 he was a legend would body the hell out of these softies in NBA right now rip big mase!
@Kern829 Lehigh Colgate on CBS sports network gate up 2!
@mkomo42 no missed it tonight but kind of glad I did at this point
Smart coaching by valpo too basically sagging off everyone except Lee and lewis daring them to shoot no room to drive to hole
This isn't going to end well hate to say it but valpo looks like better team csu way too reliant on Lewis and Grady
Well that was an ugly half of basketball both sides don't know to be encouraged down 5 or discouraged because valpo shot poorly as well
Man valpo plays some serious defense gotta find a way to get better looks
@bradbgsu nervy start both sides
Why is Ohio fouling down 12 with 25 seconds to go? Just give up ffs
@bradbgsu a new twist indeed
@Kern829 yeah decent effort I think pacers will end up in playoffs and shump was really good tonight
@Kern829 when james jones and Delly are getting major burn it's bad news bears ha
As usual we will have two shitty qbs battling it out for the job and fan base will be divided it's a broken record so tired of it
Browns signing McCown just making me dread this season even more the qb  comp breakdowns every practice and preseason game ugh no thanks
Man Delly is just not a very good basketball player
Love these pacers throwback jerseys expecting to see the davis boys throwing elbows
Bummed can't make it to vikes game tonight cmon boys bring home the title!!! Go vikes!
@walkswillhaunt @Kern829 seriously that's love hitting some big 3s which is great but again he is Damon jones plus 10 inches that is all
@Kern829 @walkswillhaunt dose finals do easy
@Kern829 @walkswillhaunt love is an expensive donyell marshall
@Kern829 @walkswillhaunt I just saw live get bodied by Harrison fucking Barnes no words
Seven games vs warriors would be Awesome me wants this bad LBJ needs 50
Sorry hard for me to like Love dude is soft as charmin Oakley winces at the sight of him
Love has a dozen rejoice #maxplayer #trafficcone
I am in q and LBJ has 38 after 3 am I the magic charm for 50 pts?
Yo @bradbgsu golden state is really good but your boy Barnes is awful he gets wide open Js all day still sucks
Every time I see a cavs jersey with #2 on it I'm slightly disappointed when it doesn't say Wagner #juanyforever
@Kern829 ha true I am amazed how awesome he looks in person huge difference
Steph curry is like really damn good first time I have seen him live since Davidson elite 8 same dominance
@TheReal_BRoss sho nuff
@spursycob but he's such a nice bloke, intelligent link up play #hesshit
@spursycob Chadli's fault mate run was too close to him hahaha
@pitbullthfc yeah short of options for sure I would even try Chadli there ahead of bobby
@pitbullthfc how many times has that been said ha this needs to stop we cannot play him anymore
@Chadwicks22 Pav was a great finisher can't deny that
@bankruptspurs such a nice bloke, puts in a shift
That was appalling I can't believe the support he still gets he is terrible at his job
@Chadwicks22 it didn't appear on live action but clear pen on further look didn't touch the ball
@mkomo42 they posted on web site the design photos but not finished product
@CoachWaters_Way good luck coach can't wait for the game tomorrow go vikes!
@realroygbiff same here, Phillies trade with Lee same thing thankfully looks like Carrasco may end up being a gem
Saw Matt LaPorta is in the Mexican league now, we dodged a bullet in that CC trade with a player to be named later = Michael f-ing Brantley
@peebs3 came close last week in CLE 
Single game tickets go on sale Tuesday for Tribe I will tweet the code for those that don't have it let's support a legit contender ay?
@tribebrowns they are trying new things which is good, really don't understand why more people don't go to games but done analyzing it
Good news is it is 10:15 and I haven't seen any fresh calamity Browns stories so got that going for me
@tribebrowns $13 and a free beer is a good deal but if you actually want to sit and watch the game not sure how many would jump on that
@tribebrowns it says they are offering lower reserves with the beer voucher it does seem strange the better box seats wouldn't come with it?
That new bar district in right field at the Jake looks awesome! I don't like buying a SRO ticket but may do the right field lowers w/that
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @Mveezy79 @peebs3 straight Hawaii look got my reef board shorts ready you Phillip?
@JackKraszewski1 @realroygbiff holy shit game on Detroit won!!!
@realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 up 2? Can't see them holding on
Shame about the arsenal

@ejtoth HAHA yes forgot that step
@ejtoth Come to think of it the DENNIS theory sounds like my relationship with the @Browns
@ejtoth Demonstrate Value, Engage Physically, Nurturing Dependence, Neglect Emotionally, Inspire Hope, Separate Entirely
@ejtoth oh yeah amazing Charlie Work hahaha this season has been great loving the demise of Dennis I need a D.E.N.N.I.S. system part 2!
Was the latest Greg Oden injury bad luck as well? #itiswhatitis
Why do people keep calling this Rose injury bad luck? Yes it sucks for him, but his knees are crocked not bad luck it's bad genetics
@ejtoth nothing can top that Johnny Karate episode so awesome #BertMacklinFBI
@JackKraszewski1 @peebs3 @realroygbiff @theHurt_Locker max innings is also so arbitrary get penalized for having better pitchers
@JackKraszewski1 @peebs3 @realroygbiff @theHurt_Locker it's more ridiculous to have to track your innings throughout whole season imo
@JackKraszewski1 @peebs3 @realroygbiff @theHurt_Locker we already limited pickups roster size can be changed
Only thing is how was Orin not involved in finale or Tammy 1 or 2 #smallgripes
Really sucks I have no more Parks &amp; Rec in my life, one of the few comedies ever that never hit a lull and only seemed to get better
@peebs3 @realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 @theHurt_Locker pus..
@realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 @theHurt_Locker @peebs3 I am not capping an innings max that is dumb too hard to manage
@realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 @theHurt_Locker @peebs3 i would love to go again what format tweaks?  max pitchers on roster?
@JackKraszewski1 don't get me wrong i like the signing could be very good I just would have liked to see what he does in the spring
@JackKraszewski1 that's what Kluber is for and there is no guarantee he still has the stuff hasn't pitched full year since 2012
Tribe rotation is going to be very good but I am surprised that they have handed 3rd starter spot to Gavin Floyd. should have to earn it
@Mveezy79 @PudPhil @realroygbiff its the price you pay when you "bout dat lyfe"
@casualmex @CoryMizer forever and ever Amen even, if we lose Sunday we sing Spurs are on their way to Wembley in 2016!
@Mveezy79 @realroygbiff @PudPhil father time is undefeated #dontfightit
@Mveezy79 @realroygbiff @PudPhil haha strangely enough she digs the beard
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @Mveezy79 clean cut and dapper for FLA no doubt bruh
@realroygbiff @Mveezy79 @PudPhil dat Giambi look beard is gone once we hit 40 degrees (so like June)
@Mveezy79 @PudPhil @realroygbiff he is a bluetick hound beagle mix from what I gather, hasn't barked much yet but who knows in future
@Mveezy79 @PudPhil @realroygbiff 
@PudPhil @Kern829 @realroygbiff ha yeah first baby Fire Ball DeSantis gender is a moot point
@PudPhil @realroygbiff the new chick's name is hot dog and she is pretty hot this is can't miss tv
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @PudPhil 9 months
@PudPhil @realroygbiff yeah dreading next month or so but he did drop a duke outside this morning so it's a good start
@PudPhil @realroygbiff haha yeah i think Biff's closet is missing the stench of some fresh dog poop. he has been pretty well behaved so far
@realroygbiff @PudPhil traveler aka travy d
@realroygbiff @PudPhil well he's not housebroken just dropped a huge deuce but he's cute ha 
@realroygbiff yep I'm not going unless valpo loses Wednesday
@realroygbiff yeah we lost at Detroit there's a chance but not counting on it
@realroygbiff basically unless valpo loses Wednesday at detroit
So csu down 2 under 4 to go at Milwaukee this is a very cleveland esque choke job
@CSUSID another twisted ankle? Seen a lot of those this year? Ugh
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 LBJ is a big X factor but nothing is store bought in Cle getting these muppets here never easy
@TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 ignore confident in tribe sausage than cavs we will be really really good but I take this store bought as well
Perkins okay not what he once was but another big body which we needed looking better and better!
@peebs3 @JackKraszewski1 win these last two and host with double bye control their own destiny next Friday's game is 10pm tip!
Huge win for Csu now need to take care of business Sunday to make sure this huge win not negated also guarantees double bye
The bank is open late! Go vikes
@czaj11 it is crazy although every NBA team basically just runs a high pick and roll
Lovely morning to run out of windshield wiper fluid, refilling it in -15 weather #awesome #needavacay
@chris_coys @spurs_fanatical @bankruptspurs never a doubt haha Soldado finally bankrupt knew
@bankruptspurs not holding my breathe mate, Kane to come on and rescue it
No Kane are they mad?
@hkane28 3 goals today? scores when he wants COYS!!!
February is the worst month ever it never ends #Ohiolife
@PudPhil @bradbgsu I think that just saves them embarrassment because no decent FA would ever come play here
@bradbgsu i really don't I am looking for Cavs news/rumors and Indians news and keep seeing more Browns shitshow articles
I honestly wish there was a button to push that can avoid me hearing any news about the Browns until draft #outofsightoutofmind #dontcare
@DavidZavac any word on Norris Cole possibly coming? Doubt Miami want to do us any favors but they appear to want to dump his contract
Now Justin Gilbert is also dealing with deep personal issues?! Do we not do any homework before drafting these guys? #clowns #newdaynewdrama
@mkomo42 @realroygbiff @ejtoth it's all the same phone has Internet /Facebook    Chat apps all the things that get them in trouble
@realroygbiff @ejtoth the Internet is a terrible place for teenage girls I'm terrified and I don't even have one
Not least bit surprised by Chelsea racism video in Paris, vile terrible club
@bradbgsu oh good God haha
@realroygbiff yeah they usually replay them night of like 1am
@realroygbiff yeah awesome a lot of stuff caught on actual surveillance cameras from the crime
See No Evil on investigation discovery so good!!
@bomani_jones @peebs3 he's such a troll
I think everyone has finally realized there is no magic elixir in draft when you have a bunch of inept stooges running the team
Speaking of, you ever remember this much apathy about a Browns draft in Cleveland? We have 2 picks in 1st and least buzz since we came back
Everyone time I see any tweet from or about the Browns I cringe that is where I am at right now. I truly don't care. #RollTribe
@Browns stop embarassing our city and loyal fans #kthxbye
@_MJTheDJ that's nice! I like your work at CSU games, requesting some old school hip hop for next game #gangstarr #tribe #mobbdeep
@mkomo42 is it false?
@RecklessRecords Do you guys know if/when your online store will reopen? You were the best place to get vinyl online!
@ejtoth @realroygbiff @Coachbp24 Michigan is up there too
@realroygbiff @ejtoth @Coachbp24 here is trailer for new series looks awesome! 
@realroygbiff @ejtoth @Coachbp24 that was in Marietta very creepy and the killer was from Akron so he had to scout out the rural area nuts!
@Coachbp24 @realroygbiff @ejtoth it is also scary how many of these take place in Ohio WTF
@realroygbiff @Coachbp24 @ejtoth yeah it is scary but awesome. new series tomorrow called See No Evil looks good!
And that happened walk off wow terrible loss 
Offensively challenged 
Bearcat what! 
Courtside at uc holla at me go uc!
@juddyfox yeah very true but at least it's easy to drive around it columbus is like a trap come in on 4 lanes shrinks to 1 on 71
Columbus Ohio has the dumbest traffic patterns and freeway setup of ANY city in USA #stuckintraffic
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @Beeskal some guy said Vega must have dropped 25 on me because I called him garbage
@realroygbiff @Kern829 @Beeskal yeah he was good went to south Florida for hoops
@Kern829 @Beeskal Bremer was awesome as a senior he had to sit behind stringer and Harris no shame in that
@Kern829 @Beeskal my only gripes are vega obviously and sonny I would replace with Dixon and Bremer
@bradbgsu @Kern829 doc Taylor as well
@Kern829 yeah check my comment on bottom of page, I think Sonny Johnson too high as well although he was Mr. Basketball
@Kern829 Vega made the list, i called out Branson on it 
F a Tony Snell
@BigMill38 @Kern829 @kernjoh @Beeskal @bradbgsu will be out of town but i would like to check one out before season ends
@Kern829 @kernjoh @Beeskal @bradbgsu I just want to hear Hoadus say Adam Auvil name again it was classic my dad still announces that randoml
@Kern829 @kernjoh @Beeskal @bradbgsu My dad said Lloyd did that a lot if guy was hot in JV game he would suit up and play for Varsity
@kernjoh @chrisbeis84 @Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal ha can't believe it took this long #redhotrickydicky
@kernjoh @Beeskal @bradbgsu @Kern829 who is chameleon? we only have 9 on 90's by my count maybe Onder does make it? who else was good on 91?
Just saw Michigan lost by 12 in OT were catching 8 that's a bitter loss ats for those who had them
@chrisbeis84 @Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal yeah he was not very good as a soph but very good after that
@Beeskal @Kern829 @bradbgsu yes I will ask him tomorrow ha
@bradbgsu @Beeskal @Kern829 yeah agreed he should have just played you guys heavy from start but didn't for some reason
@Kern829 @Beeskal @bradbgsu yeah if I remember though brad played sparingly and scullin was not quite at it yet
@Beeskal @Kern829 @bradbgsu are we in agreement then that 95 or 94 was worst ever?
@Beeskal @Kern829 @bradbgsu graduated 99 but not quite good enough to knock anyone off your 10
@Beeskal @Kern829 @bradbgsu forgot kg yeah that's spot on Skal
Blatt just put Mozgov back in this game will be over by 6 min if not
@Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal wow that team was horrid no offense
@Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal 95 team gave minutes to Wesley, Auvil and Reasoner correct? and which year was showtime Shultz divitto backcourt
@Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal was Wessell 80's or 90's? He was a beast yeah pick sauce then 91 and 97 teams that's a wrap
@Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal 90s had some very lean years from Tartara to 97 not a whole lot going on besides wit chugging Mountain Dew
@Kern829 @bradbgsu @Beeskal Rittman, Wessel, Skal who else?
@Kern829 @Beeskal @bradbgsu so did your boys Vega and Argento #garbageconferences
If Mozgov gets his 5th this is over quickly
@Kern829 @bradbgsu Mikey Mixon
@bradbgsu @Kern829 hahahaha wasn't hodge in pen too?
@TheReal_BRoss emo teens bruh
@bradbgsu @Kern829 that's who I was thinking of how about Geoff Wood and Jason Boresh?
@Kern829 @bradbgsu can't believe that kid was starting pg at iggys he was awful who was midpark big who was good 97-98? #notthegreek
@Kern829 @Beeskal @bradbgsu Wypasek brothers and Micky Mottl? Haha
@Beeskal @Kern829 @bradbgsu my dad was very critical of 80's list some of those guys only averaged 17ppg Roth got robbed surely
@Kern829 @bradbgsu Tony Decesare?
@peebs3 @bradbgsu @Mveezy79 @realroygbiff BARF
@bradbgsu @smithkp100 latest bracketology has Boilers out with 7 B1G teams in?! How is Illinois in over Boilers?
@terrypluto 90's team? Boykins, Levett, Bremer, Higgins, Stringer, Clancy, Logan, Patterson
@bradbgsu @Kern829 good call on Patterson, Greg Simpson? lol he was a McDonalds AA I believe
@bradbgsu @Kern829 Boykins, Levett, Bremer, Higgins, Stringer, Clancy, Logan
@bradbgsu @Kern829 Interesting wonder if any Bees will make the 90's team haha 
Mokeski broken nose ha 
Players now allow themselves to get held back watch Oak take care of that quickly here haha 
@realroygbiff still isn't anybody messing with him can you imagine him at John Hay? I would be terrified to step on the court with him
More Oak discussion haha 
Washington will be home soon, and if they have a problem with what I've said, I'm easy to find." Oak #legend #clevelandsfinest
Charles Oakley is the baddest dude ever to play in NBA he called out a whole team at age 45...and they did nothing
@Kern829 @Mveezy79 @realroygbiff here is his infamous call out of the Wizards legend! 
@Kern829 @Mveezy79 @realroygbiff Oak on Garnett and Barkley, hilarious 
@Kern829 @Mveezy79 @realroygbiff Oak is the hardest "He got a problem with me I am not a hard man to find, tell him come see me"
Just saw Anthony Mason had a massive heart attack and is fighting for his life that's sad one of my favs growing up he was a baaad man!
Josh McRoberts went from signing that would keep Lebron in Miami to the missing piece in Heat road back to glory all while averaging 4 ppg
@ejtoth @Billy_Seuss billy Seuss is catchy but not as good as Ron Mexico
Love that was weak sauce if you're gonna foul then FOUL him!
@realroygbiff yeah wtf? The two guys they are missing are averaging like 5 points per game (combined)
Hubie Brown reaching now says heat struggling because they are missing not only Wade but Josh McRoberts and James Ennis lol
Maybe it's petty but I am actually enjoying the shit out of embarrassing the heat #sorrynotsorry
Kyrie should never ever ever pass up an open three to give it to Delly #pullit
@bradbgsu awesome where is Dershack and Paradise
@bradbgsu there can't be more than a dozen actual heat fans left right?
Shumpert balling LBJ looking unguardable this team be scary what do all you Heat fans think of this? Hahaha
@mkomo42 fluke
I have little to no faith Johnny is answer either but Hoyer certainly isn't either there was a reason he was benched he stunk
People who seriously want us to bring back Hoyer go back and watch Jacksonville, Buffalo, Indy and Houston games. Bringing him back mistake
Bentaleb what was he doing there? Just left his man for no reason
Should we bring on Soldado for battle of the worst striker buys ever?
@mikeinparma and immediately skirts out of a tackle he is useless
Kane is unreal he just doesn't stop scoring!
@_flossyROSSY not today, have to work until 4 as well so on the same delay as you
#jokes
@_flossyROSSY I have a good feeling as well, which usually spells doom haha COYS!
@mkomo42 there is already a lot of character crossover which is awesome Tuco Salamanca is back!!
Better Call Saul is even better than I expected I am hooked
@pokeefe1 agreed that is the only change I would make we owe these lot a beating
@mkomo42 maybe but they won't lose!
@realroygbiff @Mveezy79 @peebs3 @bradbgsu american cheese sucks live a little Swiss, muenster, brick, Colby jack bruh
@TheReal_BRoss @Katie_Witham say it ain't so?!
@bradbgsu with American cheese?
@RazakelSKR that web of lies is so gripping couldn't imagine how you felt and dealt with it
His knees have gone all trembley
Come on you Spurs!
Come on you Spurs!
@peebs3 never again he will lead the line with Rooney behind
Tottenham I love you more than life! #northlondonisours
@puroinstinct yes finally!
Does love forget how to shoot after first quarter of games?
What is up with snow removal in cleveland it hasn't snowed in 2 days and main streets still covered in snow where is the damn salt?
@realroygbiff @ejtoth it's called web of
Lies they are all good they are usually on Wednesdays but reair throughout week
@ejtoth @realroygbiff ha do it but don't cheat and look at what happened online it was so unreal and disturbing
@ejtoth @Kern829 @realroygbiff only thing I remember about Disney was lots of people who didn't use deodorant
@brydesantis @ejtoth @realroygbiff check out web of lies "FarmVille horror"most messed up one I've seen on Id and that's saying something
@ejtoth @realroygbiff I get it like I said I don't even have kids yet but the Internet and kids is just bad news all around too many creeps
@realroygbiff @ejtoth these people basically have no idea who they are talking to I am terrified to have kids and them be online
@realroygbiff @ejtoth yep that's on Id web of lies, dates from hell and stalked are my favorites/ Internet dating is insanely scary
@ejtoth it's darker now I'll admit Mandy and I watched some horrific ones yesterday was double checking locks at night hA
@Kern829 @realroygbiff ha indeed thank Barkley and Robards shot put style jumper
@ejtoth just don't let your kids listen to icp and you're good
Half tempted to drive down to horseshoe casino right now because Barkley basically just implied he's heading there after game
@ejtoth web of lies show on investigation discovery it's can't miss
@ejtoth web of lies last night had a juggalo killer from Ohio I wasn't missing that
@ejtoth not yet it's on my to watch list good?
@realroygbiff only worst looking jump shot ever seen was Kurt Robards and don't think he played past 8th grade
@peebs3 it was year we got kyrie and everyone said at time that draft sucked rivers was better but new rule for no hs guys #thankgod
@realroygbiff how old is Julia Dreyfus she looks pretty damn good still
@Kern829 which chuck? #imaheat
@TheEsquireof212 ha good call he would probably start an argument too
Remember when the Cavs were supposed to tank to get Austin Rivers? #nothanks
Dream dinner with 4 other people: Bill Walton, Charles Barkley, Charles Ramsey, Bill Raftery
@TheReal_BRoss @danbender45 @Kern829 tribe time now
@realroygbiff just picked her because she is overly made up but amazed how Lopez looks for 46 blows my mind not as much as Vanna white tho
@danbender45 @TheReal_BRoss @Kern829 db on closed caption who would have thunk it haha
If you put Kim Kardashian and Jen Lopez side by side who would you guess is 12 years older than other?
Is j-lo really 46? She looks damn good for 46 charles is right age not a factor ha
@realroygbiff it's 100% true too
Surprised RadioShack lasted that long they sold same products (most times inferior) as target, Walmart, Amazon for 100% minimum higher price
@mkomo42 RadioShack out of business I told u! That place was the biggest ripoff you were their last customer
"Nobody cares how old a woman is when she pretty only when she's ugly" Barkley is a legend
@Kern829 @realroygbiff these guys are awesome though vast knowledge I like mccloud but he's screaming over ac too much ac is useless
Yo @cavsdan luxury tax isn't an issue for you so why don't you write a blank check to get charles, Marv and reggie for all cavs games #kthx
@realroygbiff could listen to charles and reggie all day this is heaven beats two guys screaming over one another
Barnes is a fu&amp;@boi watch him on way down totally just bodied LBJ for no reason he was looking for trouble
@Kern829 awesome even tossed in some analysis on signing day
@danbender45 haha I knew you heard that and cringed
I bet @danbender45 is pissed at that doc Rivers outburst
Maybe will be proved wrong but Chicago and Washington only teams I fear in east Atlanta and Toronto #foh
@mkomo42 you with Rene?
Cavs look REALLY good right now like Atlanta who? Good
Kyrie on other hand who went there is about as much unduke as it gets ha
Kevin love looks like a prototypical Duke player right now and I don't like that
I said at time best thing for the Browns would have been if NFL ousted Haslam and took control of franchise
@realroygbiff @ejtoth don't blame you, I think they will lose a ton of ST holders with this price increase on top of annual shittiness
@ejtoth he gets outcoached in EVERY big game
Is Bob Stoops immune to being on the hot seat? Not a school in the country who perennially underachieves more than Oklahoma 5 losses this yr
@ejtoth everyone could except Lane lol
@ejtoth ha still giving Sark benefit of doubt but with talent this year more than 2 losses he may be gone #Peteycomeback?
Hey @Browns can you go a single day without embarrassing yourselves and our city? Thought not! #rolltribe
How does USC always get stuck with Holly Rowe as ESPN beat reporter it is so unfitting
@realroygbiff @ejtoth bless you Biff I feel bad you give that joke of a franchise a single dollar for tickets deserve better!
@ejtoth I just feel bad for the fanbase as a whole deserve better but the circus will never end starts at top Haslam is a fuckboi
@ejtoth I am there, never in my heart can I not care but honestly, I don't even get mad or angry with them anymore I just laugh
@ejtoth it is unreal it never ends...never
Now we may lose draft picks because our GM is an idiot never ends! BUT BUT BUT THIS REGIME IS DIFFERENT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING #getf*ct
Snoop Dogg said he's gonna be pissed if his son doesn't go to USC hahaha
@ejtoth @realroygbiff true it's just one thing we can control and just ditch the circus let him be somebody else problem
@realroygbiff @ejtoth that is my point every time he does or says anything it is an eye sore for the organization let some other team bother
@ejtoth not financially but he can and has been a major distraction
@ejtoth I still see no upside of keeping him like this year he had 10 weeks to study get right and come back hungry..and fail
I see no good only bad that can come of Gordon hanging around the team unable to play for the next 1 and a half years #getrid
I am of the opinion we should just cut Josh Gordon not like anybody is going to trade us assets for him and he is a team cancer
Seriously Oklahoma City is going to have to play lights out to even get in playoffs at this point, San Antonio is currently 7 seed!!
The Western Conference is crazy right now Oklahoma City and New Orleans would miss the playoffs! Those are two REALLY good teams
I love that the Heat are 21-27 I know there are probably only 3 people in Miami that actually care but it still feels good #paybacksabitch
@PudPhil @bradbgsu 
@PudPhil @bradbgsu 
@CoryMizer yeah the seats there aren't that great but it is free food and drinks, smart by Cavs really with you cmon de Tribe!
@CoryMizer one of the club section does (ones behind basket) but the regular ones do not you just have servers around taking orders
@bradbgsu it's where titles start!
@CoryMizer ha hater! they will next season i am going on record
WOW Gustin will be a Trojan coach Sark done messed around and got the best class in the country! #FightOn
now the mic is broke haha this is awesome
HAHA this is great gotta love HS bands playing the national anthem for a kid announcing his college choice
Porter Gustin 5 star recruit choosing between Ohio State and USC in a few minutes not betting against Urb for this one
Cavs are totally sleepwalking through this game luckily it's the sixers but I think they know that day off without an actual day off ha
@realroygbiff yeah he's too small to play center and not skilled enough to be a Pf his best case scenario is to be like TT
Carter-williams isn't good either that's the thing about philly they are in year 4 of rebuild and have zero definite  "pieces" yet
Nerlens Noel is just not very good I hope the Sixers aren't keying part of their rebuild around him #10yearplan
Not going to speculate on Manziel but this is so Cleveland! Draft a franchise QB ends up in rehab less than a year later can't make this up!
@Clevelanderboat ha didn't expect this! maybe this is a good step for him but becoming more clear he is not going to be with us next season
Was an awful play call on 1 but lest not forget it took miracle to even get there #balldontlie
@mdalakas haha he may get lucky
Watching that play again that receiver stopped his route or tan it half ass terrible work by him
Brady GOAT the end
Was that karma for the bush push? Lol
No lynch there that will be questioned forever
@PF_Geo or maybe not wow what a finish!
Tyree again Brady gutted
Pats let them score? Haha you know Brady would just do it again
@Beeskal @TonyGrossi he clearly is a hater how was that dink and dunk that drive tony?
@TonyGrossi how isn't it Brady cmon t
@ejtoth hahahahaha too true
Brady unreal he just made THAT defense look rubbish the guy is filthy stones like coconuts
How do you not throw three times here? Silly call billy
@ejtoth haha of course hope Johnathan Manziel is watching this sober(ish)
Watching a living legend right now love him or hate him you have to be impressed
@realroygbiff system QB haha
@mikeinparma yep just like last year
No helmet to helmet there?
@PudPhil haha touché
Brady has not been great today it's understated how important he is to Pats he is their team period he needs to be awesome for them to win
@PudPhil he's awesome I miss him at sc
Petey staking his claim 2 in college 2 in pros? Impressive
How was there no hold on seattle there? Saw two New England guys thrown to ground with pushes in back
@petemally ha I will settle forOasis reunion!
@bradbgsu oasis reunion
Last three halftimes have been good Bruno Mars was my fave glad they stopped with the Senior Circuit tour the who was the worst
@bradbgsu Lenny sucks rest was cool just enough weird to be good
For real that was an awesome half time show and I'm a hipster music snob
@bradbgsu @KatieCork13 busta rhymes and hammer next? Missy should have done the whole halftime tho! Money
@KatieCork13 bizarre but I want that shark costume for Halloween next year checking ebay tomorrow ha
@JamesCatullo they are awesome checking ebay tomorrow
Did I eat shrooms an hour ago?
@KatieCork13 @bradbgsu I will settle for one teat
@PudPhil we need some happy pizza commercials at this point damn
@KatieCork13 @bradbgsu and thereit is! Wow this is year of sadness!
@ERTarr @bradbgsu where is the dominos Noyd when you need him!
@CZambataro1 thanks god I need a hug at this point ha
Belichek just scratched his ear and smelled it gross!
@ERTarr @bradbgsu make it stop please why all the doom and gloom

Nationwide: Your mom is dead.
What happened to talking animals and boobs? #whensbcommercialswerefun
Microsoft now jeez make it stop this is depressing
@PudPhil @realroygbiff hahaha and then go back in and bitch that it has "stuff" on it #meatandcheeseonly
Nationwide f u thanks for that dickheads
@Clevelanderboat under ha
Finally a commercial that made me laugh and that's why Doritos are awesome
Odds that Manziel is drunk now OFF will get in a fight tonight EVEN
What is over/under on hours until tmz breaking story of how Manziel was drunk in a club?
That was a dart from Brady
@realroygbiff @PudPhil @bradbgsu Marino got f'd lot of bad teams and bad defenses
@PudPhil @bradbgsu it's not the end all be all but not pointless either still most important measure of greatness fair or not
@bradbgsu @PudPhil just picturing thanksgiving at mannings 2030 Eli asking for More gravy holding up that hand with 2 rings ha
@PudPhil I know that's why I was saying it's strange in a flukey type way Peyton is 100x better
Eli manning ending up with more super bowl rings than Peyton is one of weirdest sports stories of all time
Very un Brady like rewound that and still I clue who he was throwing to
@bradbgsu oh yeah Sirius lithium is still best station ever
Took all of one series for refs to screw up a call this league bruh
@bradbgsu 90s grunge bryan likes this
. @clevelanddotcom Livingston article is wrong Carroll and USC didn't vacate any national titles, Bush forfeited heisman check your facts
@Kern829 hahaha Rubio is most overhyped player ever can't shoot and always hurt
Remember when 76ers beat us and were acting like they won a playoff series? Yeah monday shouldn't be fun for them
@DavidZavac working out better for them ha
Z Ilgauskas, L Hughes, E Snow, I Newble, B Gibson, D Gooden, S Pavlovic, D Marshall, D Jones #finals
Gm LBJ is pissed and feelin it
LBJ tho <FIRE><FIRE>
@mkomo42 for real! What did he ask for what did you give him?
@Kern829 thought biels was a bowling champ
@Kern829 holla my dad said baseball was his best sport
Thanks for sitting Wiggins flip I mean really thanks
@Kern829 Marion and Miller are glue factory
@Kern829 rather play Jones at least he's money from three
LBJ tho
@mkomo42 missed vikes today first place holla
Even Austin Carr just said Delly hit that three out of nowhere
Sorry but Delly should be in Canton saw a few players in Csu game today that are more NBA ready
@TheReal_BRoss agree but that face was more like he knew he fd up trading wiggins for love
@Kern829 did you see Blatt presser last night? He seems pissed that everyone thinks/knows that LBJ does whatever he wants
Gm Lebron looks pissed he traded away wiggins lol
People thought Dion took bad shots? Shumpert looking to trump that
@ejtoth pretty sure Curtis Martin didn't get in first ballot and he was 10x back bettis was he was a bust in St Lou/La
@Kern829 @markross330 hate to agree with Simmons but never seen a guy fall off a cliff this much in one year like love has
@ejtoth cool nickname and played for the scum that's all it takes these days
@markross330 @Kern829 also why is Minnesota booing Love do they want to run back that trade? I'm game
@Clevelanderboat ha he has to be on LBJ payroll now he is attached at the hip
@Kern829 @markross330 I believed they may have rigged for us but probably didn't anticipate we piss away a talent like wiggins
@Clevelanderboat gm LBJ hit the panic button too early
If you knew nothing of Love and Wiggins Prior  and watched this game you would probably say the cavs are insane for making that trade
@Kern829 painful wiggins is a monster
Imagine if we hadn't traded Wiggins? Let's ask GM @KingJames what he thinks ha
@TheReal_BRoss @ejtoth I was lead member of johnny bandwagon but he seems all talk I'm in show me mode
I loved Drakes draft day song hook featured Wiggins and Manziel good chance both are done in Cleveland in under a year lol
Wonder of nuggets fans will boo Mozgov? #timofee
@ejtoth @TheReal_BRoss just as long as they win and stop wearing pink for breast cancer I'm good
@TheReal_BRoss @ejtoth we should strive to be Oregon we don't win shit like them might as well change up our unis
@bradbgsu Green Bay is shit csu in a laugher
@Treylew3 good luck bringing a crew down to support you guys go vikes!
@mkomo42 just getting ready for football season!
@realroygbiff @ejtoth yep new regime will come and say we are different we know what we are doing then they fail rinse repeat etc
@ejtoth @realroygbiff @Browns just wait until Mark Sanchez and this Raiders OC lead us to the Super Bowl next year bwhahahaha
@realroygbiff oh yeah that's right well that is good news because judging from ticket price increase @Browns gonna lose a lot of ST holders
@Clevelanderboat you are stronger than me did it 6 years ago ha
@TheBobbyUllman that is crazy like they are making up for 6 years in one price raise!
@Clevelanderboat wow that is quite a hike you keeping them?
Probably means we will see more blackouts for games #thanksJimmyH
Curious to see how much season tickets went up for Browns judging from some of these retweets I am seeing they went up significantly #bold
@Beeskal @Kern829 you guys read Gordon essay? he is so unlucky poor guy
I still don't understand what Gordon says his actual problem is if it's not drugs or alcohol? Stupidity? Bad Luck?
@ejtoth hahahaha hey @JOSH_GORDONXII what's the number for your doctor? my throat is sore #datlean
Hey @JOSH_GORDONXII I am sure that ASAP Rocky had a bad cold and was doctor prescribed dat lean to cope LOL 
and took the codeine syrup without consulting anyone? if you believe that I have no words
I mean guys like Jamarcus Russell were kicked out of league it is widely glorified and abused in young black culture but Gordon got a cold..
The codeine sizzurp and the second hand smoke arguments are hard to swallow. You have to be really naive to believe that
@ejtoth as you say majority of guys in NFL beat the odds with poor upbringings he can pat himself on the back for that right out of league
@ejtoth agreed, in that letter he says he is not a victim but still proceeds to list all the reasons he is a victim
Apparently Josh Gordon is the most unlucky person in the world or he's full of shit you can decide for yourself
Sorry Josh for not believing your story take it to another franchise we have seen enough in CLE
@Beeskal @Kern829 jealous that's another level, although I hated him at time @Kern829 was his #1 fanboy #postersontheceiling
@Kern829 he was absurd last night some of those step back 3's he hit wow. special
@Kern829 nope they still lost! the degree of difficulty on his 50 was insane i still watch this video occasionally 
Equally amazed that neither was LBJ but to be fair to him he could probably get 50 every night if he really wanted to
Amazing that I saw the only two 50 point performances at the Q 18 years apart! I don't know which one was more incredible #Iverson #Kyrie
@casualmex haha this is madness last 10 minutes just summed up supporting spurs
It's never easy is it
@Clevelanderboat @ChrisFedor ha yep box score all star
“@ChrisFedor: Andre Drummond will finish with a double-double, but he wasn't good tonight. Hollow achievement”have a feeling happens a lot
This is nuts detroit literally tried fouling kyrie and they wouldn't call it!
@peebs3 that was another level shenanigans count the bucket and get two free throws for off ball foul #waitwhat?
Just checked Cle -8.5 this last two minutes reek of shenanigans especially after seeing the line #Donaghey
What's the line on this game? Some curious phantom calls here at end to keep Det somewhat close
Take that max money you were gonna give to Love and give it to Mozgov (or am I just in teenage love phase with him)
Kyrie kill em boi
@bradbgsu @Kern829 who started that Whitney? #macdaddyopposite
@bradbgsu @kern829 Caldwell pope could have used a "pirate" call there
The fact we have shot terrible from 3 and basically everywhere winning by 10 on road against a hot team speaks volumes #cavsgettingscarynow
LBJ should never shoot threes
I know Drummond is better than expected still not impressed with him looks like he is in la la land half the time
@peebs3 I know that's why I'm surprised he didn't go to iu as a legacy
@peebs3 surprised he's not a Hoosier
Mozgov is a beast for real unreal the difference he has made for us
26 days until spring training go Tribe!!

@Indians when can we buy single game tickets?
@PudPhil @realroygbiff No worries we have Jim "Dray Day"
@PudPhil I like Cameron but on the flip side he couldn't stay healthy all season and tailed off end of 2013 not sure he is worth that much
@PudPhil not surprised his QB may be Connor Shaw lol
I am not a Brady fan boy I hate the Patriots and all Boston teams for that matter but no denying his resume
Brady: 6 Super Bowl Apps., 2 SB MVP's, 3 SB wins, 2 time NFL MVP, Most Playoff wins, yards &amp; TD's can only get better after Sunday
@bradbgsu ha just the facts no argument can top his maybe even before Sunday but definitely not if he wins
@PudPhil everyone cheats if the Browns aren't trying to steal other teams signals and stuff then I am pissed
Also I know some people don't want to hear this but if Pats win it closes all discussion on who is goat 6 bowls 4 chips #gameover
It's Tuesday before super bowl and I've heard very little about the matchup and the game it's bizarre just talk about deflated footballs
We are still hearing about this deflategate? seriously? people need to get lives
Csu got absolutely jobbed today by officials total home cooking total fouls 22 csu  11 oak also lewis got hammered on go ahead bucket no cal
@Treylew3 @grady_15 you guys got screwed tonight worst officiating I've ever seen so one sided deserved to win go vikes
@CSUSID I know you can't but that was terrible all game lewis getting hammered on last play just summed it up
@CSUSID these refs have been awful letting oakland mug us every possession
@bunburyfestival when is the lineup for this year released?
@forecastle what time is the lineup released tomorrow? and what is the first way to see it?
@clevenatigirl @walkswillhaunt hAhahaha wanna be Brit from ny
@bradbgsu huge bummer considering chelsea and city knocked out but fighting on other fronts so not a tragedy
@SpursOfficial hey sort out the website can't login to listen!
@CSUSID Are Hales and Yates out tonight? looking forward to heading down to watch the Vikes tonight!
@realroygbiff spygate didn't have close to this attention it's all over like regular news I can't get away from it make this stop already
@ejtoth it's unreal everywhere I turn it's new breaking news on footballgate Andrew luck doesn't even care
@realroygbiff it's a joke they lost by 40 points I'm pretty sure they were still playing with a football not a tennis ball
I've heard several players and ex players say every team tampers with the footballs it's still a damn ball does it really alter outcome? No
Maybe it's just me but I find this patriots football gate uninteresting irrelevant and boring #whocares
@Kern829 dat gate looks legit this year turned a corner now that ur boy emmitt legacy is gone?
Of course that's why the trade looks good just saying #lovemesomedionswag
Don't get me wrong I love how the trade is looking but miss me some Dion he was entertainment an not knowing what u get every game intrigue
Loving this cavs squad but if griffin is really a bawse he would trade Delly and miller to get dion back
@Kern829 ha great minds
@Kern829 he can take dellys minutes I'm sorry but not seeing any useful qualities in him at the moment
@Kern829 dare I say this but not interested in shumpert coming back jr is balling and much better scorer
@Kern829 LBJ wanted this drama? Haha
Yo this Mozgov is a beast
When LBJ came back this is what I pictured me likey
I was wrong jr smith is a bawse haha
@casualmex @CoryMizer isn't it all poorly done!
@CoryMizer oh duh of course haha
@CoryMizer what the hell is your avatar I have spent 5 minutes trying to figure it out ha
@CoryMizer and yeah it only works day of game for that cheap because people would rather get something rather than eat their tickets
@CoryMizer C107, and no they don't charge your card until someone accepts your bid as far as I know
@CoryMizer yes Kane can't do it himself and Bobby looks like a lost cause
@CoryMizer yeah they have that bidsafe so I just bid on like 12 different good sets of tickets bound to get one of them to bite
flash seats is awesome just got two club seats for tonight's cavs game for $25 a piece haha
@CoryMizer don't get all negativity towards Ade if the club allowed him to leave to attend personal matters? plus hes better than Soldado ha
@realroygbiff 
@danbender45 we didn't start the fire appearance on parks and rec hilarious
Listening to Lupe's new album first song 9 minutes no hook he just goes and goes #awesome
@peebs3 i have it ready why you hiding? (traveling i assume)
@walkswillhaunt @clevenatigirl hahaha
@clevenatigirl I love the song as well just a weird version and ad placement for it ha
As this day can get weirder Acura commercial using orchestra version of the pixies where is my mind in very confusing ad
To show how pointless college hoops rankings are St. John's went from 15 in country to last place in conference and on bubble in a week lol
Don't put much stock in college hoop rankings but how is Dayton not ranked at 15-2? Returning most of elite 8 team and destroying teams
@bradbgsu Id like a gauge at how gutted packer fan is after that unreal how they lost that game
Wow that is the most cleveland like heart wrenching loss I've ever seen from a team not from cleveland
I'm starting to realize how much a genius @walkswillhaunt is don't have a return man or return team only bad things happen
@realroygbiff @ejtoth cousin Mose is his special assistant
Seattle and Green Bay probably never see onside kicks idiots as Browns fans we see minimum of two every week
@ejtoth yes lol thought tnt ad market cornered on that
So Dwight Schrute star of new crime procedural on fox that should work for about 15 viewers nationwide ha
Russell Wilson got dem money Manziel numbers today lol
@Kern829 haha forgot about that bizarre how they all wore Asics low tops for hooping
@TheReal_BRoss I was never a huge fan but it's actually pretty good catchy pop tunes no country shit
@SpiritsOfLeo is there a vinyl release of Anastasia? love the album
Old school Cleveland hip hop remember grabbing this at Downtown records on Prospect now shop closed sad still a jam 
@bradbgsu @Kern829 @ejtoth haha that is every Dad's only goal isn't it? #stayoffdatpole
@ejtoth @bradbgsu @Kern829 bbhhs class of 2033 shaping up nicely
@pokeefe1 surely we can't go the rest of the season with just Kane?
@theHurt_Locker yeah it is hilarious the gang try and break Wade Boggs beer drinking record on cross country flight it's awesome
@ejtoth haven't laughed that much watching a sitcom in ages instant classic
This always sunny episode is the funniest I've seen in ages chasing Boggs beer record hilarious!!!!!
@realroygbiff @walkswillhaunt @Kern829 we should have never made that trade and just waited it out
@walkswillhaunt @realroygbiff @Kern829 sadly looks that way, worrying part is we went from a ton of flexibility before LBJ came to none
@realroygbiff @walkswillhaunt @Kern829 worst part is I don't like LBJ's body language at all he seems just as frustrated as the rest of us
@realroygbiff @walkswillhaunt @Kern829 this season is getting more depressing by the day this was supposed to be fun!
@ryant635 ha awesome!
Congrats Buckeye fans! and a big thank you for keeping Oregon as the college football elite wannabes
Ballgame another season we get to hear about Oregons Nike money when they come up short in big games #stillnochips
@Kern829 bucks coordinator is trolling with these pass plays no need for them
Elliot and Cardale no need for anyone else to touch the ball clearly
That's like the 4th time today Cardale has just "Bosworthed" a linebacker
Mansgame
In NFL that may not have even been a catch
Man that's a killer switch of mo
Much different players but way Cardale shrugs off tacklers reminds me of big  Ben even when they are squared up on him can't bring him down
@Kern829 if I go to sleep now I won't wake up until 6:30 #oldmanprobs
@realroygbiff @BigMill38 @Kern829 hard to say how huge 1st round picks are with our history lol #mingo #trich #weeden #johnny #gilbert
Worst part about college football now what to do for next 40 minutes? Ha
Oregon even tried to dress like Buckeyes today! #fraudulent
@BigMill38 @Kern829 his stock will certainly never be higher why not? Especially with this shitty qb class
@BigMill38 or even better Michigan ha
@PudPhil true! This dude is a freak strong arm and can't bring him down scary combo but have a feeling his brain will hurt his career ha
Cardale first three games Wisconsin, Alabama Oregon and shredding them all never seen anything like this kid is special
@PudPhil I thought you loved midgets? Haha
Jones been really impressive again unreal how good he has been with absolutely no game experience
@PudPhil @realroygbiff haha true I would
@ebendersays what time is tip tomorrow 5?
@ejtoth I'm in
@Clevelanderboat best tweet ever
“@darrenrovell: Peyton Manning’s playoff record will go to 11-13. He has been “one &amp; done” NINE TIMES in the postseason” that's damning
@mdalakas @ebendersays ha Eric won't be the same not seeing you cruise in that Buick!
Father Time is undefeated #Peyton
@bradbgsu @PudPhil @realroygbiff haha yeah but isn't swish like 8 years younger the fucking bum
@ejtoth @realroygbiff I love your hatred of him pure venom haha
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @bradbgsu yeah it's sad Father Time catches everyone last month he's ages noticibly
@realroygbiff @ejtoth he's like Harbaugh if you aren't on his team you will hate him
@ejtoth @realroygbiff lay off my boy Fisher #usclegend
@ejtoth @realroygbiff that was an awful day 10-6 and nuttin so cleveland lol
Brady, Montana, Elway then huge gap to Peyton and others that's how I see it
@ejtoth good point I don't think that helps at all
@realroygbiff @bradbgsu I say it's Brady, Montana, Elway then a big gap to Peyton and others
@realroygbiff @bradbgsu I said he can't be considered GOAT not that he isn't great same for Marino
@bradbgsu well I agree but when you have Tom Brady right next to him those rings speak volumes
@bradbgsu last month he's looked like he's aged 10 years
Not hearing any arguments about Peyton being goat, 1 ring that's it lots of playoff eggs laid
The fact that Mike Carey is always wrong or opposite of call on field shows how dumb NFL rules are he's supposed to be an expert haha
This looking like a pass the torch game from Manning to Luck one year too early for NFL liking #fixisin
@mkomo42 @JackKraszewski1 @walkswillhaunt @Kern829 I am getting there #grumpyoldman #collegeovernflallday
@JackKraszewski1 @walkswillhaunt @Kern829 basically all you have to do is underthrow your WR and they make play on ball it's flag everytime
@JackKraszewski1 @walkswillhaunt @Kern829 agree I watch less and less each year used to live for NFL playoffs now I can take it or leave it
@jrjanko hahahahaha
@jrjanko did you play patty cake?
@Kern829 @Beeskal yep it's fixed they want 4 great qbs watch Denver get all calls now
@Beeskal yep it makes zero sense common sense can take out half these NFL rules
NFL has way too many rules and plenty that are open to interpretation it's ridiculous these games hinge on whatever refs feel like calling
Want gb to win but NFL rules are awful how was that not catch by Bryant? If it's a run play ground cant cause fumble but after catch it can?
@mkomo42 football is king
@czaj11 @Kern829 starting to question again why we went all in before season we should have waited team wasn't complete anyway
@czaj11 @Kern829 well having a true 5 should help otherwise we are screwed because we have up a ton for him
@czaj11 @Kern829 I'm hoping it "clicks" or LBJ gets him to buy in but I don't think he gets the level he needs to bring it to win
@Kern829 @realroygbiff oh it's effort on a lot of occasions he doesn't even attempt to stop lay ups some times
@Kern829 @realroygbiff he still needs to man the f up LBJ will hopefully get in his ear his effort is not nearly good enough
Really starting to worry about all people who said Love is a box score hero 17 and 16 boards but watching the game wow he was bad
Kevin Love is getting abused tonight Mozgov can't come quick enough
Marshall Commmandos pride for those hoop dream fans, Beverley hardly had any D1 offers and not drafted tough kid showed in movie
If you can check out "Hoop Reality" it's sequel to hoop dreams by Arthur Agee and follows Patrick Beverley so cool to see he made it!
@bradbgsu Mozgov can't come soon enough
@mkomo42 every school already cancelled dude
Who would have thought in October we would start a 4th quarter with: JR Smith, Delly, Marion, Joe Harris and TT haha
I will give JR Smith credit for playing defense in at least 1 game more than can be said for Kevin love <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I am happy with JR's effort but yall need the pump the brakes it's one game tigers don't change their stripes
@TheReal_BRoss just wait bruh
I've literally never seen JR Smith play this much defense his whole career ha #honeymoon
Kyrie for 50?
@markross330 yeah no kidding he's gotten a free pass all year after this LBJ vacation he better fucking d up
@TheReal_BRoss I would think/hope so he should be used only in specific games/situations not in regular rotation he can't f'n shoot for 1
@TheReal_BRoss he's fine for like 5-10 min in tight game when we need stops but he's playing WAY too much right now
@Kern829 that beard is not a good look
Exhibit A Chris Pratt/Anna Farris baby:Jack Exhibit B Kanye/Kim Kardashian baby: North #yaheard
I'm convinced if you want to know if actors/actresses are cool or dbags just look at their children's names
Yes there is thousands of tweets of people saying whoever this Paul McCartney is Kanye just made his career #prayforouryouth #sad
Well I feel a whole lot better about Waiters trade now that we got Mozgov exactly what we needed #rimprotection
@realroygbiff @bradbgsu 2015 fantasy mock draft now? It is total fantasy land, many players not even sure what team they will be on
@bradbgsu touche
@bradbgsu you are now in timeout
Just heard an ad on the radio for a 2015 fantasy football preview and mock draft, please tell me there aren't that many losers in the world
@Kern829 @matthewdelly @joeharrisuva @kernjoh sequence is best game ever
@LittleOhio yes! I literally had to rewind the DVR because I couldn't believe it was actually her
I think I would watch literally anything that Gus Johnson and Bill Raftery announced a WNBA game included
Johnnies vs Nova on fox sports 1 with Gus Johnson and legend Raftery this is heaven
@ERTarr I'm honored ha
Celebs should holla at Vanna White if they want work done she looks amazing at like 60? She's had to have something done but don't notice
I mean she looks real bad almost unrecognizable
Just saw a commercial for cougar town (which I can't believe is still on TV) courtney cox looks awful same plastic surgeon as lil kim?
Coachella lineup is very MEH. Not one headliner that I would be overly excited to see and rest of lineup is mostly festival type regulars
That article didn't even comment on my favorite thing that in #3 in his senior hs yearbook photo his quote was "Get chicks or die trying"
@petemally oh yeah! that was out of nowhere and amazing!!!
This is what the Cavs are getting? good lord an A-1 fuc*boi   
Year end best of lists on the net are so important now I think artists don't want to be left off so better to release in middle of the year
I think digital releases killed the holiday album releases. Used to be a race to get things out for Christmas now artists wait until Februar
Next few weeks albums to check for: Game, Lupe Fiasco, Joey Bada$$, California X, Ty Segall, Amen Dunes, Sleater-Kinney, Belle &amp; Sebastien
Next Tuesday finally some albums looking forward to hearing. December to mid January is like the dead zone for new music releases
Embarrassment to lose to that team don't care who is out defining moment for this franchise today will end up in tears this year me thinks
@realroygbiff we have to be getting a big guy out of this
Cavs better be getting a big from someone or I don't get this trade
I like shumpert but coming off injury my only thinking is Dion forced the move I really hope we just cut JR. Smith he's just trouble
Wait we just traded Dion for Jr Smith if you are worried about chemistry I don't see how the hell that helps and he's not nearly as good
@SpursOfficial of course he looks bright he's a fucking GOD
“@jaybothfc: What kinute minute is Kane going to score in? #kanesweepstake” 51 I like this game
@mikeinparma I am amazed my new hero
Manziel in yet another nightclub incident he's all talk gonna be the same old shit with him clearly
@SpursOfficial at least I'm not missing Kane in action this is embarrassing coverage all the way around of an all pl cup tie!
@spursdenn it's not broadcast anywhere mate no streams checked all day
@Kern829 that thing is what legends are made of
Should say minimum 6 national titles USC has 10 but who's counting lol
Bama, USC, Notre dame, OSU all have 6 national titles Oregon has zero fraudulent bellends
Not a buckeye fan not claiming to be but that was an awesome game and well deserved win by bucks please beat Oregon biggest wannabe program
I'm just so glad that assclown Lane Kiffin no longer is poisoning my program
@Kern829 that was let my foot hang in air for a minute and dive for a flag lucky to get any flag
That's not a 15 yard personal foul cmon Urb
Don't worry Lane will probably get fired and get the 49ers job #failingupwardsalways
Lane Kiffin yall say no more he can go f himself
And been saying all year sec is not what it usually is showing in bowl season including today not an invincible  Bama by any stretch
Been impressed with Jones he has made some bad throws but physically he's a monster and that's your third string guy? Really impressive

That ball boy with skunk looking high top fade <OK HAND SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Stupid Baylor blew up my bowl challenge title quest
Dumb call by Baylor just pooch it inside the 10 one minute no timeouts left idiotic
Admittedly I didn't watch him a ton in regular season in Miami did he have games where he just looked like he didn't care?
Lbj had phantom injuries before he left and now since he's back serious question did he come back home so he could just coast??
World class Kane there I said it
I am amazed how damn good harry Kane is seriously top top class striker he has it all
Kane da based GOD
This cavs team is soft Lebron is main one to blame he's the leader efforts like this cannot happen embarrassing
Leonard Williams is so damn good
@mkomo42 that reminds me of trading places Lionel Joseph front eh Cameroon!!!!
@mkomo42 just dealing with the facts yo and remember that home and home about 4 years ago? #trojansweep
@bradbgsu he should stick to the story he is Amanda's cousin
@mkomo42 still would beat osu on neutral field right now
@bradbgsu removed what happened?
Usc secondary been awful dropped about 4 easy picks and blown big plays no excuses too everyone healthy
@anthonydeangelo ha yea not saying it's believable but neither is most of the movie
@anthonydeangelo phone lines knocked out from wind storm #sadiknowthis
I could get used to not working and watching family feud all day
@SpursOfficial @hkane28 Kane is GOD
@realroygbiff some asshole at target parked so close to me I had to get in on passenger side fucking nightmare
If you have a choice DO NOT go shopping today I just got back and it is a complete nightmare people are morons and everything sold out
Must be December I have zero interest in watching the last Browns game
@realroygbiff yeah he faded badly especially after Gipson got hurt
@Kern829 @DonteWhitner was thinking the same thing he can't possibly think he deserves pro bowl?
@ejtoth id say it's not our biggest roster need haha
@realroygbiff I agree thought he was our best lineman really moved people in run game and hardly any mistakes
@ejtoth just remember more mistakes than usual but like I said I'm not breaking down tape on tackles either lol
@realroygbiff yeah it's hard to gauge I guess seems like once you get in the club you're in until you retire
To be fair not like I'm watching everybody's left tackles very closely just an observation
Not hating but did Joe Thomas really have a pro bowl year? Seem to remember a lot of mistakes
@Mveezy79 haha holla
Early Christmas presents from the wife #love 
@mkomo42 hAhahaha legend
@NChadli lasagna
@Pacewon can you give any spoilers who you did collabs with? Young zee?
@hayleyorrantia ha when do new episodes come back?
Seriously once U go to a bar and order a drink and they pull out those measuring thimbles ask for your check and run
Bar rescue sounds like a death wish why would you go somewhere that pours weak drinks and gives no freebies #realtalk
All I want for Christmas is never to see or hear another "Flo" progressive commercial
@bradbgsu I wouldn't congratulate yet still early self usually like izzo gets them peaking in march
How bout dem temple owls! @bradbgsu rock chalk who?
@PudPhil @Clevelanderboat @bradbgsu no not just blaming farmer but everyone was quick to anoint him including myself lets pump the brakes
@Clevelanderboat @bradbgsu @PudPhil guess farmer isn't a genius after all lol
@JackKraszewski1 @Kern829 @TheReal_BRoss guess we will find out but I doubt Manziel said I can't go if he did than I will eat crow
@JackKraszewski1 @Kern829 @TheReal_BRoss he got injured no we have no clue if he's good but what sense to put him back in if he has injury
@JackKraszewski1 @Kern829 @TheReal_BRoss because our season is over if he has an injury why the hell would we play him? Not rocket science
@Kern829 @JackKraszewski1 @TheReal_BRoss they aren't going to throw him out there with any sign of injury now for what?
Unwatchable can't block can't catch can't throw can't run offense is a total shambles and has been for months
@realroygbiff I swear he is just making up rules half the time
Mike Carey is a moron how is Winn down by contact nobody touched him?
Don't know why Cam Newton not wearing a mouthpiece bothers me so
much maybe because of that shit eating grin every 5 seconds
Did Shanahan call that qb sweep on 1st down intentionally to get Johnny hurt and out of there? Haha #conspiracytweet
Hoyer still sucks I wish I something else to do today when does the cavs game start?
Again Johnny has been terrible no excuses but did any analysts/out coaches watch him at a&amp;m he wasn't running option why run it ok nfl dumb
Just dumb asinine play calling our best play of half was straight drop back pass
Manziel has been bad no question but what the hell is Shannahan doing? I guarantee if he just called the same damn plays he did with Hoyer
What a terrible play call result inevitable
@walkswillhaunt @realroygbiff he has a better home now lucky dog haha
@Kern829 haha nice
@peebs3 starting to get nervous admittedly
So @danbender45 didn't @peebs3 and I tell you months ago it would be mount union vs whitewater for title? #streaksnochance
@mdalakas best Italian in the city!
Nice back door cover from the vikes haha someone in Vegas is really pissed by that 5-0 run in last 20 seconds ha
@JamesCatullo one direction
Looking for new music check out @CayetanaPhilly new album Nervous Like Me all girl band with a great retro rock sound!!
@CayetanaPhilly you guys are awesome just got nervous like me on vinyl can't stop listening!! Touring? Come to cleveland please!
@mkomo42 @Mveezy79 @realroygbiff I can actually do next Monday I have really no work Tuesday
@bradbgsu scared to play at wolstein
Cleveland state on
Espnu at 7 against undefeated Virginia shock the world! Go vikes!!!
@realroygbiff @mkomo42 @Mveezy79 vl when can we go there?
@realroygbiff @mkomo42 that's awesome I can be a personal tour guide
@realroygbiff @PudPhil @Slivo23 dat wife tho
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @Slivo23 I can't believe Clausen is still in the league that was the most shocking part of the story!
@mkomo42 it's not an album it's a song ha
Not a "hat guy" but since when do fitted hats cost 30 to 40 dollars? what a racket
@drock87 that is the taj mahal of cat towers!
@Clevelanderboat @PudPhil I wish we had the sheriff or domas brady
@PudPhil @Clevelanderboat I'm not punting on him after one week the gameplan was retarded this past week as well
@Clevelanderboat same on you Marvin ha
@walkswillhaunt that can be argued but same people were annointing him as savior last week let things play out
If Johnny is that bad next two games we MAY need to look at a new QB but it's not going to be Hoyer (nor should it be) so just stop it
These Hoyer (told ya so) tweets are ridiculous a) he sucked too b) he won't be here next year so you are spiting yourself as Browns fans
Understandable the national media is having their kicks at Johnny's expense but as Cleveland fans we have to get behind him!
Kneejerk reaction in this city is hilarious. People chill out it was one game!
I've seen enough grocery shopping time
Why are we running zone reads? Just horrific
Is shurmur our coach again wtf
Thank you about time!
Did anyone watch Johnny in college he did not run the fucking option?!
@PudPhil this is a total joke of a gameplan
Fox making this game even more unwatchable
@inn_keeper terrible
Gotta catch that cmon
@Kern829 yeah way too predictable
Where is all the bootlegs we expected to see with Johnny? Weird gameplan although we have barely been on offense to be fair
@Kern829 waiting for the proverbial Benjamin worthless tweet ha
So predictable that the whole team looks unprepared this week
@ejtoth unreal last week everything went right except the qb today everything is going wrong except the qb
That was a statement drive by bengals maybe that penalty by Mingo wasn't worth taking!
I will take that penalty early set the tone
Home just in time for Johnny c'mon d get a stop lets see the magic
@TheReal_BRoss Johnny's lil so appropriate to the unleashing of Johnny time baby
@GLBC_Cleveland ooh tempting
Can we get Piers Morgan deported? What a dbag he is
@GLBC_Cleveland open bar?
Red Sox big fail this offseason lose Ceapedes and get Masterson and Porcello not moving any trees haha
@GLBC_Cleveland is there a Great Lakes party?
@bradbgsu I think they enjoy springing out of their seats the moment u land to grab their carry on like it's gonna walk off or something
@bradbgsu yes why don't people gate check how the fuck can you lose it when it's on the same plane as you
@bradbgsu it's absurd people bringing full size suitcase as carry on
@WindyCOYS Dembele is a complete liability should get rid in January
@bradbgsu they're fine sent the b team today
This match has just reminded me I never want to see Dembele Paulinho or Capoue play for us again
Soldado my god he is just so worthless in front of goal
Cespedes good get for tigers especially if they get Latos to replace Porcello yikes! But still think tribe will be in the mix
Just saw an interview on 
Modern family apparently promoting drunk driving lol
@hayleyorrantia what's your favorite current band?
@Kern829 @ejtoth he torched the buckeyes too holla but I hate wisky hoops now
@peebs3 @mkomo42 where? Saskatchewan?
@mkomo42 they live in Windsor though so I'm going to casino Saturday
@mkomo42 party for Mandy's best friend I guess
@mkomo42 not so far fetched
@mkomo42 I wish I'm in Canada until mid afternoon Sunday watching on slight delay
@Mveezy79 @peebs3 hilarious probably why he has been slacking even more than usual on big 5 duties
What the hell is so important to Ray Farmer that he can't try out a few kickers? This is one year ain't worried about draft in December
@mkomo42 oh big letdown dammit I would pay lots of cash to see you interact with Johnny
@Kern829 sounds like he might be if so he should just get his ass back on sidelines
@ebendersays @realroygbiff Belichek coaches defense muppet
I don't get these coaches bolting Wisconsin? Are they underpaid there? I mean for Oregon State? Bizarre
@mkomo42 wait what? You actually
Saw Johnny?
@ebendersays @realroygbiff you are irrational regarding Brady
Lil John Rinaldi asking @Bengals Coach Marvin Lewis about Johnny 'Midget' Manziel 
@ShaqCoulthirst Cole World!! album of year
@Pacewon nice can't wait! Is it with one producer like Green or different producers?
@Pacewon any new album cooking?
These Hoyers ain't loyal whoa these Hoyers ain't loyal
Don't know why but I have a recent urge to play beer pong. I think i need to organize a tournament for old times sake!
@JColeNC You just dropped a classic vinyl release please!!!
Early days but David Blatt looks like a REALLY good coach. Been so impressed with his in game adjustments and the use of rotation.
@ejtoth nobody has had that and been dominant after
That new J. Cole album is wheeeeew! #getthat
@peebs3 @bradbgsu keep sark out of this but that's my point been there and I would argue sc is a bigger pull (slightly)
@peebs3 @bradbgsu kiffin
@mikeinparma yes best song ever period no discussion
The knock on Jonas V is he gets tired looking very true today invisible in 2nd half
@MackenzieSmith @bradbgsu he loves all white athletes who are "tryers" #maxeffort
@Kern829 @bradbgsu must have been all those weights and homocentric selfies with lbj
@bradbgsu lol sucker for them and soft tossing lefties
This is fun #cavsbaby
Delly is awesome how do you not love that guy?
@mkomo42 she sucks
@DavidZavac and Love he has been awful today might as well put a cone on the block instead on defense
Great work by dellt but again terrible effort by Love he has been horrendous tonight
@peebs3 @bradbgsu those all look like pipe dreams <SMIRKING FACE>
Kyrie seems to have fully bought in in defense now it's time to get Love on board @KingJames handle that please
My name is Jonas is killing us #weezerstyle
K Love back in no defense mode LBJ not liking that
Cavs have looked so much better recently but finally hitting open 3's had made a huge difference
Damn Dion kill em bruh
@TheReal_BRoss so ridiculous
That comment was also unprovoked he offered it up bengals players even have to be saying wtf
That Marvin Lewis apology is priceless I can just picture him scouring little people of America site haha what an assclown
@GVartwork @IsaiahCrowell34 Feed the crow shirt on the way?
It's officially JOHNNY TIME! Rejoice #MakeMarvinPay
One thing which hurt LBJ in Miami didn't have a bench guy who could score consistently hoping Waiters embraces this role now for us
If Johnny scores Sunday he should run over to Marvin Lewis and bust out the Lollipop guild dance
If Marcus Semien is all it takes to get Samardzija then the tribe better raise them a Jason kipnis
@Kern829 finally seemed to be having fun he needs to keep this up
@Kern829 was talking trash to jay z sitting courtside after a few dunks
@Kern829 was epic even included calling out Hov I will now call him out before every game
@bradbgsu LBJ should be averaging about 32 mpg have to save those legs
Nice job Blatt get LBJ out of there and now Andy limit dem minutes
Kill em Dion kill em boi
Damn cavs look real good tonight this is what I'm talking about now finish them!
@bradbgsu he misses them
Every time and Kyrie is almost at 85%!
@ERTarr was awesome he just repeated the questions hahaha
LBJ should never shoot our tech free throws ever why is he doing that?
New pregame ritual: call out Dion lol
@ejtoth @realroygbiff @SC_Cleveland haha Dalton is hot garbage he's probably jealous
@bradbgsu the way he's played tonight is perfect bench energy and attack the rim
@bradbgsu his jumper is worrying he is getting open looks his shot looks terrible fading badly
@bradbgsu right on cue a nice step back and sweet dime he heard me hating don't go Dion!
Y'all know I'm a huge fan of Dion Waiters but he is terrible right now think his days with us our numbered
@bradbgsu @realroygbiff think is best for all parties at this point kill this supposed locker room divide
@realroygbiff he also has done nothing to help jff I thought that's part of reason we kept him here in first place
@realroygbiff some reports saying we may actually release him because he has been stead fast he doesn't want to be a backup
Barring an injury to a starter I doubt he will ever start 13 consecutive games the rest of his career
Honestly it was going to always end badly for @bhoyer6 &amp; browns but he got shot of a lifetime he should be thanking them
@scott2824 @LaneAdkins @jsnider33 comes with the job and honestly I think 90% browns fans were behind him until this last month
@scott2824 @LaneAdkins @jsnider33 maybe so but I get more a sense he's scared to play a rookie qb not just Johnny
@LaneAdkins @scott2824 @jsnider33 Hoyer is average at best the only reason he had such a long leash was because he's from here
So basically Pettine alluding that he is going to Johnny but needs to talk to both qbs why not get that done before presser? Very odd
Funny how Johnny is labeled as the arrogant QB yet he has said nothing to ever throw a teammate or coach under the bus
@DavidZavac seeing this Hoyer downward spiral is sad to watch went from team first to me first
This is quite sad re: Hoyer the qualities that made him so likable to begin with are evaporating before our very eyes
@RuiterWrongFAN wow full on delusional no accountability only thing he cares about now is keeping Johnny off the field sad really
My favorite "Browns hot take" is start Connor Shaw because Johnny is immature and Hoyer blows hahaha only in Cleveland
Indians reportedly getting Brandon Moss from Oakland he slumped second half last year but big time bat we sorely need
@tehTrunk @bankruptspurs @premleagueowl for sake of Tottenham we need Lamela to come good but needs to earn his place
@tehTrunk @bankruptspurs @premleagueowl Chadli also has 6 goals in the PL and just back from injury but anything to make excuse for Lamela
@SirFranksnBacon @egoldie80 Hoyer got there at 7 how that work? Johnny wasn't expected to play why get there early? this is a non story imo
@bankruptspurs @premleagueowl there are other issues but I want our best 11 out there and imo he isn't near our best 11 at the moment
@premleagueowl @bankruptspurs i agree to some extent but how long can we persist with Erik when he is costing us results?
@ejtoth tweeted yesterday become more of ego thing with Hoyer to keep JFF off field more than anything else passing blame as his play worsen
Hoyer post game presser was a joke too no accountability, Oline played well he had all day, we ran the ball pretty well HOYER YOU SUCKED!
@ejtoth Sure did if he persists with this "Non QB-centric" take we are doomed whether it is JFF or someone else uneed a QBwin in this league
@ejtoth all this unwritten rule BS I guarantee if Pettine told JFF he wanted him there at 9 am he would have been there then it's petty BS
@ejtoth it's shitty I think Pettine is old school and doesn't like JFF approach but ultimately it hurts the fans because better QB on bench
Fan &amp;media reaction was split last week re: QB decision not this week. If Pettine doesn't go to JFF it's going to be an ugly scene Sunday
Funny thing is Jff has more long term interest in browns than Hoyer this is his audition for a payday but hey don't slate our hometown hero!
@mdalakas nope 10-6 bro all he does is win hometown hero that gets it! <SLEEPING FACE>
“@MarkMaske: Browns might go to Johnny Manziel now. It's a week too late... 
@ejtoth spot on as usual and I'm tired of hearing from joe Thomas about his thoughts on Qb do your job and shut up you aren't a GM bruh
@ejtoth @realroygbiff when will it be ready I'm still stewing!
@realroygbiff yep I like Pettine but think he buckled to someveteran players opinions he has to make these decisions that's what he's paid
Also if the coaching staff had no trust in JFF why the hell they go to him on road in a crucial game? I don't buy any of this nonsense
@realroygbiff it's a joke it's like Hoyer stinks so there has to be a reason Johnny isn't playing, Pettine made this bed...
Hoyer got there at 7 how dat work tho
Players have to be at stadium by 11 jff got there at 10:50 I really don't see why some are saying this is an issue?
it's not like Johnny looked out of his depth in extensive pt in preseason so we are supposed to believe he will be worse 14 weeks later?
@KatieCork13 @JackKraszewski1 yep they were Petey advised him to stay in school
I like how Hoyer being awful has turned into Johnnycomes late to games, clearly jff not prepared to start in nfl, pettine doesn't like jff
@KatieCork13 @JackKraszewski1 I doubt that had anything to do with it heard he comes in that time all year he wasn't starting either
@rockincft ha thanks
@Clevelanderboat should be about winning egos out the door I can't honestly believe Hoyer gives us a better chance to win
Can't wait to read more articles from old curmudgeon journos who dislike Johnny saying how browns should stick with Hoyer
These cliches kill me too can't pull a qb when you're winning during game...can't pull a qb with winning record how's that working out now?
Pettine included in that today hand over heart would have had more faith in Weeden in there 2nd half than Hoyer he is shot of all confidence
Some cleveland fans baffle me they will ignore all rational logic and game footage and just rely on blind hope it's time to wake the f up!
How long we gonna trot out he's 10-6 hometown kid? One more week it looks like until he officially ruins all playoff hopes
Listening to Hoyer after game it's gotten sad he clearly is more concerned with keeping starter job than actually winning games anymore
@mkomo42 yep Pettine has to own this
Makes me sick pettine has to own this terrible clock management and terrible decision to stick with Hoyer
How not go for that? Is rather have 3 or 7 points then pinning them back it comes down to trust clearly pettine doesn't trust Hoyer anymore
@ejtoth 10-5 dude
@CoryMizer haha
I've seen a better half of quarterback play from Doug Pederson
So all Hoyer does is win lol
@ejtoth hahahahahahaha
So this isn't going well one more drive of that mess and we have to pull the plug
How was that not a fumble? Idiotic from Hoyer
@bradbgsu @Mveezy79 @ejtoth holiday vs sc?
@ejtoth simple man just looking for some low-def living that's all I ask
@TheReal_BRoss @LittleOhio hahaha tweet of year going through same struggle need more TVs yo
@ejtoth Dillard's bout dat life #polohilfigerboi
@ejtoth crab legs
@ejtoth bruh they earned the right more than anyone
Pretty sure I just saw Derrick Coleman on a catch phrase commercial #cuseisindahouse
@realroygbiff @jrjanko James you need to give him some hairstyle advice #dontfightit
Dion falling into bad habits shooting the ball he was shooting so well in preseason too
Wondering why James jones doesn't get 10 minutes a game or so dude is automatic
@bradbgsu negative
@Kern829 @bradbgsu finally getting it and playing defense LBJ must have had a word
@Kern829 cut her off while you can ha
What is the female obsession with target I'm convinced it's impossible for a woman to go to target and spend less than 50 bucks
I hate the Timberwolves how can they ruin Philadelphia's perfect season? sad sad day
@mkomo42 @Kern829 Big 10 is a basketball conference now should give up football haha
@mkomo42 Redskins with Doug Williams? that was 30 years ago different era
@ejtoth exactly think he felt pressure much easier to go back to Johnny if Hoyer stinks than vice versa
@ejtoth yep he's basically saying he's happier with Hoyer playing as a robot game manager not going to work in this league
How many teams have won a Super Bowl in the last 20 years which haven't been "Qb-centric" The Ravens w/Dilfer? um yeah thats it
Pettine said our offense is not QB centric? um yeah that's because we have one playing which is not capable of making plays
Pettine  "with Brian we have been effective chewing up clock and getting wins" lol that is what our offensive aim is with him? says it all
Put record aside if you have watched Hoyer play the last 4 weeks how can you say he's earned the right to start Sunday he hasn't earned shit
@ejtoth haha I am with you it reeks of the safe cop out decision
I sincerely hope Hoyer plays well Sunday because if he doesn't it's going to look bad when he gets booed
I really think Pettine cracked under pressure from this decision, think he felt he owed it to Hoyer but emptions should have stayed out this
@clefan_11 agreed think it was the wrong move
Still Hoyer at starter not convinced but I hope he proves me wrong and we get the win! He will be on a very short leash I imagine
This is going to be awesome! 
Also not saying Browns will go to sbowl and jff will light it up. I don't know how he will play but worth roll of dice
My last argument for JFF do 49ers go to sb with Alex Smith? No but they did with Kapernick not saying he is elite but more than game manager
@bradbgsu agreed I just got in a heated argument with my pops he wants Hoyer I see little good to come out of that at this point
@bradbgsu Johnny or Hoyer?
@bradbgsu he looks to be the odd man out needs ball to be effective still think he can play a role on this team tho
@bradbgsu different horses for different courses ha
@cilvaringz1 when does your album drop?
Sixers 0-17! Big hurdle to get over on Wednesday playing the terrible twolves the dream season is still alive!
@markross330 yep we will have a good idea after these next 4 games
To hear his record as a starter every time we lose a game he is a good backup but we need to see if we have a franchise qb in Johnny or not
I hope people are fair analyzing Manziel it's the toughest part of schedule and injuries mounting Hoyer was good servant but don't want ...
@ebendersays agreed although I think they should have made the move after atl game but understood why they didn't
@ebendersays whys that?
I give Pettine credit too that took stones to make that switch but it had to happen as I said better to be proactive than reactive
Keep seeing qb controversy tweets really? There really isn't Hoyer has been bad for over a month now it's no gamble to go to Johnny
@mkomo42 are you watching on delay haha
@Kern829 hahaha would've hilarious would start a riot
Johnny!!!!!!
Man the difference in arm strength is crazy
That's enough seriously he sucks
@Kern829 no more excuses for Hoyer he needs to make plays
@ejtoth ha I will we really need to pull the plug on him after this week we aren't sniffing playoffs with him
Hoyer looks so much sharper today that's a good sign
@ejtoth all good doth the fuck on
@CoryMizer this shit is too easy lol
28-0 is that correct bahahaha #returntoglory
That escalated quickly fight on it's way too easy hahahahahahahahaha
Dat parade tho...
@PudPhil @realroygbiff so the old cast is done then? I knew lil bit was gone but thought the rest were coming back
@realroygbiff @PudPhil damn it started I missed it
Protestors before you make your sign check your spelling and grammar seen some gems #stopthevialence
@ejtoth my heart says Hoyer will be rebound and play better but my head and 30 years of watching football tells me otherwise
@ejtoth same here i don't think they will i just hate to see us go down on a sinking ship without trying something else
**Grammar correction Hoyer has regressed not digressed #anywayidigresscarryon
@mikeinparma correct oops haha
The more worrisome part is aside from Cincy last 5 opponnets he has struggled against have been really bad teams
In last 6 games Hoyer has been good in 2 (cincy, oakland) by good i mean no mistakes, good game managing he has been awful in the other 4
I want the Browns to keep winning but I can't ignore how Hoyer has digressed
My thoughts re: Hoyer. He should start this week but JFF should get plenty of practice time and if Hoyer digresses again.. roll the dice
@Kern829 yep we should
Yes!!!!!!
Well Hoyer your job and career is on the line here go win it
Does pettine think they are just gonna run out of time? Idiotic use the damn tos
Take a to WTf?
@ejtoth he has been all day that's at least 5 I have counted not even in the vicinity of Gordon would have been huge plays the gig is up!
wtf!! Is Hoyer doing and why are we throwing?
Do not throw the ball again ever falcons have really gift wrapped this one for us Hoyer horrendous today winning in spite of him
@bhalishak my patience is wearing thin he is missing wide open receivers by several yards
@bhalishak yeah I'm fine with that too but he's got to play better clearly jff not gonna play Hoyer has to step up his accuracy
@bhalishak you mean Hoyer is a must start?
Hoyer has to play better I've given up on them putting Johnny in but Hoyer accuracy is getting worse by the minute killing us
@jaybothfc who gets sent off first Vlad or fazio? What a shambles we are
@jaybothfc absolutely he is worthless shit going forward and terrible defensively
Dembele absolutely pointless player and sorry Lamela has been shit (again) wants way too many touches
@peebs3 yeah bags and bags of fun and Home Depot was seriously in the cards today ha #oldballs
@peebs3 you earned it! Ha funny part is I was literally writing a thank you note like half hour ago
Everett Golson for heisman anyone? Haha looks like he has a case of the Knoblauchs fight on!
@peebs3 surprised you aren't at senior day to give Gardner a special send out
@peebs3 champions league unreal pardew legend haha
@CoryMizer yeah but saysmultiple times how he was up for the fight. he was the worst culprit imo he was just swinging on guys randomly
@CoryMizer finally read that piece about the brawl in Detroit really well done. I would still like to hear Ron's perspective crazy stuff
@CoryMizer going to cavs game tonight so pumped don't know what made me think of that brawl but was really intriguing moment
@CoryMizer awesome thanks!
@Kern829 yeah without a beer soaked floor that guy was in serious trouble
@CoryMizer no do you have a link?
@Kern829 ha guarantee that is the reason good point
That also ruined Jermaine O'Neal career who was a budding mega star at the time
When else have you ever seen professional players (multiple) trading fists in the stands with fans
How has there not been a 30 for 30 about that brawl in the palace? Most surreal thing I've ever seen in sports
@realroygbiff @JackKraszewski1 @TheReal_BRoss yeah I'm saying watch Pitt sigh Tate to
Replace him
@JackKraszewski1 @TheReal_BRoss steelers just cut Blounte it all adds up
@realroygbiff they should be pretty good most previews have them picked to win or second in horizon
Have mixed feelings seeing Bryn Forbes ball for sparty wish he was still at csu but wish him well
Gonzaga v Smu kicks off 24 straight hours of college hoops #allnighter?
@Clevelanderboat it's early days but looking that way
@Kern829 does Dion have his own shoes? Those kicks he's wearing tonight are money
@ChrisFedor just tonight? He seriously needs to have a look in the mirror two sides to basketball he only plays one
Cavs just getting out hustled tonight going to have to expect everyone's best shot big adjustment for everyone except LBJ
Kyries defense has to improve he's like a traffic cone on defense
What's up with Mike Miller? He has been horrendous
@bradbgsu 73 more for perfection
@ejtoth thing which worries me is his accuracy we have gotten very lucky this year he has floated many passes which should have been picked
@ejtoth think we have seen what he is. when he is on can manage a game when running game is good but when forced to make plays very bad
I don't watch Houston a lot but JJ Watt is unbelievable.
@ejtoth that's two awful games by Hoyer (Hou &amp; Jax) where clearly he didn't have it why not sit him a series and see what happens
@ejtoth the loss isn't totally on Hoyer but he was horrendous. I don't understand why they couldn't just give JFF a look in 2nd half
@danbender45 sorry about your watch #purplekitties
@mkomo42 erroneous maybe 6-2 6-2 my serve would get me a few games conditioning is shambles
@Kern829 don't steal my thunder
Watching the cavs but sixers intrigue me more
Kelly Olynyk is good I told all of you bellends we should have drafted him
Mavs 123 sixers 70 they are the nba version of the Washington Generals
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @bradbgsu #slivo
@walkswillhaunt @realroygbiff that's my thoughts as unimpressive as fsu been they still unbeaten and da u has been terrible for years
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @bradbgsu hey guys give me $40 a man and we drink for free all night (who said this)
@realroygbiff @PudPhil @bradbgsu how bad can red bull be we must have drank 10 cans a night with shots
@PudPhil @realroygbiff @bradbgsu how is our tab $400 well you had 78 cherry bombs hahaha
@PudPhil @realroygbiff every time I see Orton I think @bradbgsu at skeepers proclaiming him heisman front runner cue fumble, loss snowball
Leonard Williams is Clowney but he actually tries every play with same or more talent #1 overall in April book it
@JackKraszewski1 @ejtoth that's why I thought that grounding call was warranted he just chucked that right after snap no clue where route wa
So bummed the cavs didn't draft Nerlens Noel dammit
@realroygbiff noles have been so so but I don't understand how they have become so underrated still team to beat IMO
@ShannonReiffen3 @insidetroy never seen a team talk so much shit down 26 it's high comedy
Fsu isn't clicking but that line is beyond shady the u is bad I like noles by 20
Cal is jokes never seen a team talk so much shit down 26
@Kern829 ball don't lie I guess ha
That's grounding for me clearly he chucked that because of pressure
@PudPhil @realroygbiff you guys listen to me easy money with sc
Dallas 84 Philly 45 seriously how can the nba allow this? Total joke
Haha where is 94 now bet he got held just wasn't called lol fight on
@ReignofTroy have u ever seen a DL celebrate getting held like a td? Ha only cal down 21-2
@insidetroy have u ever seen a DL celebrate getting held like a td? Ha only cal down 21-2
Never seen a DL celebrate a holding call like a touchdown what a loser especially down 21-2 hahaha
Espn how about a new story "insert school players" have a chip on their shoulder because they weren't recruited by USC
14-0 early this cal secondary looks very Swiss
I wish I could watch every Philadelphia sixers game last check they are down 30 in the 2nd quarter #0-82
@ejtoth hahahahhahaha
That didn't take long!!! Fight on Cody Kessler is really good those close losses killing his heisman chances 26 tds 2 ints!
@ejtoth love him true frosh both ways @peebs3 still waiting for those hoke recruits to blossom lol
@ejtoth shit is smooooooth Sua and Leanord W gonna get looooose
@realroygbiff oh no I will cut someone if that happens during USC game
@realroygbiff @PudPhil they are decent but sc has taken care of mediocre teams pretty handily this year
@realroygbiff @PudPhil stone cold lock where the f is peebs? Is there a Harry potter convention somewhere?
@mkomo42 don't hate appreciate
@carolinekras @JackKraszewski1 best tweet ever jack grammar fail hahaha
@mkomo42 @PudPhil @realroygbiff @Mattvonlehmden MVL sounds more like mike Irvin now than Irvin himself #dau
@mkomo42 they will batter your buckeyes muppet
@realroygbiff @PudPhil we will batter paydon playoff choker ha
@kelseywont it does I'm not gonna lie haha
Why does family feud always have one all white family and one all black family?    #stopgameshowsegregation
@PudPhil @realroygbiff probably be smoking a blunt in your reef board shorts hippy lol
@PudPhil @realroygbiff Phyl you dirty traitor you are stuck with this browns shitstorm you aren't welcome at Super Bowl parade in February
@PudPhil @realroygbiff bills are going to crumble like cheap toilet paper their gig is up
@realroygbiff for the record I have them in big 5 peebo hasn't responded must be watching golden girls again
It's usc Trojan Thursday holla beat cal! Fight on!!
Do you think Kluber cracked a smile after he got the news he won the Cy Young? I doubt it but congrats anyway Brantley for MVP??
Good news for sixers fans is I'm sure there is another 7 footer coming out with No offensive skills and bad knees
Funny thing is there is no LBJ type out there sixers don't even know who they are tanking for just want that ping pong ball real bad
Ted Stepien is pissed at Joshua Harris and the sixers trying to take his throne as best tank job ever
Forget the cavs and LBJ though the most intriguing story in NBA is can the sixers have a perfect season 0-82? That is one horrendous team
@JusAire really? Cool had no idea and the shorts they have are separate I assume?
Speaking of 30 for 30 they need a new name they already have about 100 of them
This clown on espn doesn't have fsu in 4 team playoff what a joke this
Network gets worse every day thank
God for 30 for 30
@Kern829 how is Dion? Injured I see and already coming off bench didn't take long
@Kern829 I did see how LBJ got his faux triple double was Ahmad keeping official score?
Figures cavs don't play until Friday I haven't gotten to watch a full game yet I'm jonesing to see the king and boys do work
@JackKraszewski1 @jrjanko American Airlines don't fly much so don't know what's bad and what's good anymore
@jrjanko I'm back I'm still a bit irked over plane and airport etiquette I'm convinced if you want to see the worst in people go to airport
@mkomo42 @JackKraszewski1 greatest tweet ever
Why do people stand the moment a plane lands all the way in the back rows? You know you aren't going anywhere for 10 minutes
Last tweet before I'm in Mexico thanks to everybody that took part and came to my wedding love y'all! Esp. @Kern829 best speech ever late!
Man looks like we really blew it in this draft Evans and Watkins are stars and we got a corner who looks terrible
@Mveezy79 agreed think we will blow this
We better not be trying to kill the clock here!
Credit to Hoyer he has been pretty poor today but that was a great pass to Gabriel now let's hang on!
Well we got our old browns back this game is painful to watch fighting to stay awake
That is shurmur esque clock management? What the hell was that?
Glennon is terrible wow only thing keeping us in this game
@realroygbiff we have played 3 of the worst teams in the league and can't score touchdowns
@realroygbiff it's time
Sorry to be that guy but I'm ready for Johnny time he can't be any worse than Hoyer and will bring another dimension offense been terrible
@Kern829 awesome reading over your speech now again amazing!
@Kern829 oh good point oh well getting my spare set now
@Kern829 yeah they gone! I don't know what I did with them
@Clevelanderboat thanks much! And still no keys! Haha
Thanks for everybody coming to wedding! But if someone can tell me where my car keys are would be helpful haha #brideandgroomstranded
boom ha 
Friday holla no work til 11/11 bo
@mkomo42 just a random ad ha
@ejtoth @realroygbiff @Mveezy79 @Kern829 yeah we dodged a bullet not getting him!
@Kern829 funny that first night I get to watch colt McCoy slanging te pill around haha
@Mveezy79 @ejtoth word next party getting extra loose haha
My new baby might never leave couch again 
@ejtoth @Kern829 Mormon fail
@ejtoth getting cut up by polygamy so there's that
These 10 pm tips killing me yo @ejtoth this is pedo state handle it lol
@TheReal_BRoss he was an awesome hoops player too
@mkomo42 he's only 21 years old!
Been saying for weeks Kane should be starting every match he's our best striker
@markross330 I think his noodle arm will be exposed
@ejtoth also you said great article and Mary Kay Cabot in same sentence that's an oxymoron lol
@PudPhil @bradbgsu hope he crushes that rapist
@PudPhil @bradbgsu agreed said weeks ago we aren't good enough to take any team for granted surely Oakland smells blood and gonna play hard
@bradbgsu so is his noodle arm
@bradbgsu haha best tweet I was thinking that last week needs to bic it or get a bigger headband even the king can lose out to baldness
@bradbgsu me too not ready to pull plug on Hoyer but I think his performance yesterday was a dose of reality not long term answer
@ejtoth Sua is a beast! Emailed you but college football watching this Saturday holla
@bradbgsu if Hoyer lays an egg this week will we see Johnny?
To be clear I am not calling for Johnny yet BUT I think this week showed why Hoyer isn't a long term solution
I hope he bounces back but I wasn't getting carried away before this week he's benefited from good run game and good play calling
The real test for Hoyer starts now teams will stack the box and the wide open receivers off play action not gonna be there anymore
#FightOn  
@ejtoth Toth's takes my Monday highlight as usual but you should have included this gif! haha 
Death, taxes and USC song girls being hot #Hughhefnerrecruits

@ejtoth when is toths takes ready? I like this strange feeling of victory feels so good once it hits your lips
Steelers complaining about a cheap hit the ultimate irony we have arrived scoreboard bitches
This is unreal can't happen again
@CS41MLB what's your favorite restaurant in Cleveland?
@ReignofTroy usually don't complain about officials but this has been a joke today
@ReignofTroy was it a hold? Never showed replay and the way we are getting screwed today want to see it's legit
Never seen that ever a play reviewed and then on review a new penalty discovered and flagged terrible terrible precedent
For those not watching zona got called for illegal forward pass play reviewed was reversed and on review usc gets tagged with personal foul!
As Rasheed Wallace says ball don't lie! Officials in the pocket of zona but don't let them decide the game well done Troy!
@JackKraszewski1 Poland first EVER victory over Germany in Euro qualifier holla Polska bet some serious partying going on in Krakow tonight

Wow I can see how this game is gonna go terrible terrible call
@peebs3 I like toddy more bet?
Johnny Manziel still a system quarterback?
@peebs3 very bold young peebs but yes egg bowl will be epic!
Hotty toddy is legit who would have thought title would go through not Alabama but Mississippi!?
Penn state vs Michigan used to be a big game in mich defense they didn't harbor a pedo so there's that

“@sheridanhoops: Looking at projected win totals for all 30 #NBA teams: 
Amazing comeback what more can you say hang on Super Bowl lol
@RebeccaKZiegler I can't blame him I was laughing at this team as well
@PudPhil ha yep at least this so bad You just have to laugh I was laughing same time as Johnny!
I'm sure Johnny laughing will be the only story heard about this game tomorrow
Now this is just getting hilarious f it bring out Johnny lets build for next year
Wow we are an awful football team
4-12
Terrible you could tell they looked at schedule and assumed they had wins coming
I hate to say told you so but I don't get why this browns team has overconfidence they have earned nothing
@mdalakas haha mind the seating chart
Oh well off to bed browns will cheer me up tomorrow hahahaha couldn't even tweet that with a straight face #prayforbrownswin
@ejtoth Wilcox came with sark from uw #notimpressed
That last tweet says it all
Terrible coaching in last 5 minutes was clear sark was just playing not to lose
That loss officially puts sarkisian on hot seat sorry but that is two losses that are on him #kneejerkbuttrue
@ejtoth @realroygbiff like why in the fuck did he have qb pooch punt instead of regular punter pin them back?
@ejtoth @realroygbiff deserved to lose to be honest terrible coaching job by sark in 4th quarter that game should have been put to bed
@ejtoth @realroygbiff yeah he's a great lb but why the fuck was he back there where the fuck was the safeties
Wow brutal loss just terrible that can't happen game was put to bed like 4 different times
Oh ffs knock it down!
Wow terrible call by officials there clearly a catch and first down for asu not challenged will take it haha
@realroygbiff @bradbgsu @PudPhil ha they  mentioned it on game so I'm sure traffic was horrendous #bababennyandthejets
Dodger playoff game usc home game ucla home game Elton John at staples would love to get a Los Angeles traffic update lol #justwalk
Su'a Cravens next great Trojan guy is everywhere reminds me of That guy who plays for steelers
Fight on boi! That bc game is the ninth wonder of the world bizarre game and outcome
Shatter *their world
Also a fan that notre dame kept there season of false dreams alive can't wait to shatter there world November 29
Ok we owe asu like 5 ass beatings no excuses take care of business #FightOn
@CoryMizer I was thinking that pretty embarrassing lol
Bob stoops is the modern version of John Cooper never seen a coach do so little with so much talent
@TheReal_BRoss exactly they will be fine they got smoked at arrowhead which a lot of teams do tough venue to win at always was/is
On page 25 of Charles Ramsey book and find out after he rescued the girls he walked an hour to Diamonds Mens Club in the flats haha #legend
Brandon Moss has been awful for last 3 months cue 2 bombs today haha any given ballgame
That Cespedes for Lester trade looks worse every day
@kelseywont yes that's awesome! Bring your drinking and dancing shoes!
On first listen new Weezer album is a pleasant surprise, they stripped things down some real catchy tunes on there!
Fight de f;($) on! Beat dem beavers
@ejtoth hahahahhahaha
Hailol to the victors
Coming from the guy who had lane kiffin as head coach just rip off the band aid yo
Don't want to pile on but damn getting smoked by Minnesota no words hoke should be fired immediately
@realroygbiff @peebs3 @bradbgsu that hoke is a good coach wish he was at USC lol
I'm also reluctant to buy or download anything from itunes because once you do it is forever stuck on your cloud!
Anyone heard the new u2 album yet? it's free and I haven't gave it a listen yet which tells you my expectations of it
@bradbgsu awesome!!! Can't wait to read the essay haha
@BenPearceSpurs I bet Dembele even takes a pee slow and methodically
@JackKraszewski1 @realroygbiff first off there just aren't many great hitters available secondly we have to overpay like swish for instance
@JackKraszewski1 @realroygbiff I agree they need to do something but trade is more realistic we are not getting a power bat here in fa
@TheReal_BRoss problem is of course there are so few available
@TheReal_BRoss I like that actually I agree one big bat is all we need
Wow JB shuck is the worst baseball player I've ever seen not only have I not seen him get a hot he never makes slid contact ever
@JackKraszewski1 very true
@realroygbiff absolutely he's done a better job this year than last!
Tyler Holt, JB Shuck, Chris Jimenez these are guys we are trotting out in our everyday lineup we can't expect to win with these clowns
@JackKraszewski1 it's so frustrating if we even could get 3-4 runs a game we win almost every time
@ejtoth it's unreal every team in the league has an upswing except us it's a culture of losing that survives through multiple regimes
@ejtoth @Kern829 didn't Benjamin muff a punt as well that he recovered?
@ejtoth maybe one day when we are all in assisted living
@ejtoth probably your best one yet I don't think you could have said it any better sums up all browns fans feelings exactly
This crucial tribe game is microcosm for why we will miss playoffs great starting effort ruined with no offense
@mdalakas do you have the 6? if so how is it?
Ok job done! now let's get the nightcap! roll tribe!
@PudPhil it's always warm in dat casino haha
Stoked to see so many out of towners making it in for the wedding especially @PudPhil @KatieCork13 and @Roldiddy !
@theHurt_Locker @RebeccaKZiegler I wish not gonna make it, bring home a winner!
Corey Kluber with legitimate chance to win Cy Young 1st in K's 3rd in ERA 2nd in Wins if he can win Thursday think he will get it
I guess I am getting old but I don't understand people who go down at 7 am to tailgate for Browns and have no intention of going to game
@bradbgsu yessir he will outduel Duffy I have faith!
Doubtful Tribe will get in playoffs but if we do Kluber, Carrasco is a serious 1-2 punch would be a tough out in playoffs
Truly amazing the Tribe even has a look at the playoffs with the lineup we have been trotting out there, starting pitching has been so good
@realroygbiff @mkomo42 I don't like commish Komo the power has gone to his head
Well Indians playoff hopes come down to today win two and we are 1.5 back of Royals and sh*t gets real!
@mkomo42 @realroygbiff where was that comment last week? #Davis
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @ejtoth @bradbgsu about us we need to break that stigma
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @ejtoth @bradbgsu and when we see jax in schedule and say we should win that for example everyone we play says that..
@Kern829 @realroygbiff @ejtoth @bradbgsu not what I'm saying we are better I'm just saying we aren't good enough to take anyone for granted
@realroygbiff @ejtoth @Kern829 @bradbgsu i am positive everyone we play looks at us on their schedule &amp; thinks that is a game they will win
@realroygbiff @ejtoth @Kern829 @bradbgsu doesn't mean shit we still have to find a way to win games
@realroygbiff @ejtoth @Kern829 @bradbgsu yeah it hurt so many chances to put the game away and we failed on both sides of ball and sp teams
@ejtoth @bradbgsu like wek 1 many were happy we came back and tied it, bullshit so we didn't look like a CYO team in  2nd half we still lost
@ejtoth @bradbgsu I am so tired of validation and moral victories with our fans in losses it needs to stop
@bradbgsu tale as old as time every year around midseason we start hearing well we should be 6-5 and in playoff hunt bullshit is what it is
We could just as easily be 0-3 so remember that we made key plays in Saints game that is all it boils down to
Please don't say Browns coulda woulda should been 3-0 every NFl game comes down to a few key plays and we simply don't make winning plays
@TnoBambino yep fun to watch and all business!
Love watching Kluber pitch his facial expression is permanently fixed like a guy whose wife dragged him to a coworkers retirement party
Mingo again was terrible he is worthless they just pinch him in very play and run to his side and he never touches a qb
@mkomo42 so when we pick up taliaferro from Baltimore this week better not hear any bulkshit he is rice backup @realroygbiff
@Clevelanderboat I'm convinced even with him we would find a way to lose it's in the franchise DNA don't know how we change it
Not blaming loss at all on Hoyer my point is so many guys/coaches contributed to losing that game it's sickening the losing mentality
@Clevelanderboat I said he played well just saying that could have been 6
Even Hoyer who played well today if he hits Gabriel in stride that's 6 and game second straight week he underrhrew a guy to win it
NFL of all leagues is such a fine line between winning and losing and you know which side we are on keep finding new (and old) ways to lose
gut wrenching loss but I said this in week 1 when some were happy we came back a loss is a loss and we have had losers mentality for 15 yrs
If you look up textbook browns loss in the dictionary today's game is prefect example
I gotta feeling Cleveland's going to the.... #GoBrowns
@peebs3 I don't get how you are still a Hoke guy but I applaud you for loyalty
@peebs3 lol just saying your program deserves better than this clown
Brady Hoke might as well just go home at halftime and try to sell his house terrible football coach @peebs3
@BenPearceSpurs people forget that game was pretty even before that penalty decision we could have easily been level or ahead before that
Hurry up conference play what a terrible slate of college football games today
@markross330 yeah brutal but we are rallying here in 9th!
@markross330 so frustrating what do we expect with a dude named JB Shuck in the lineup
@realroygbiff no kidding dumbest fucking rule I've ever heard of
@realroygbiff we need like 30+ from all receivers to have a chance
@Kern829 @danbender45 @realroygbiff @ejtoth last time I was there waitress dropped a steak and knife on @jrjanko back lol
@danbender45 @Kern829 @realroygbiff @ejtoth jealous I missed it today but for $3 it actually isn't bad I've had worse steakthat cost 3X that
@Kern829 @danbender45 @realroygbiff @ejtoth they are actually not bad but small need to order 2
@ejtoth he is terrible except for the one week @Mattvonlehmden faces us in playoffs last year and he threw for like 500 yards
Why does Tito keep playing JB Shuck this clown hasn't reached base for us since the angels left that turd on our doorstep
Great another credit card breach at Home Depot this is ridiculous gonna have to start using cash it ain't safe no mo!
Not that i trust those ratings anyway but it's a good quick poll rating to see if worth checking out
Hate how they allow people to review albums on iTunes before it's released can never get on honest read because of stupid fanboys
@mkomo42 ha that whole thing gave me a headache our team is cooked anyway we lost 4 starters to injury last week
@markross330 yeah easier said than done but at least we are done with the tigers haha
Not only losing Cespedes obviously hurt them but had a trickle down effect on whole lineup Moss has been awful since he left
Was one of few who didn't like the trades the A's made when they happened ruined the team chemistry and should have never traded Cespedes
@WindyCOYS another worthless performance at least Townsend tries to make things happen
@bradbgsu you love those puss throwing lefties #traber #tallet #sowers #huff
@walkswillhaunt time will tell has to show over full season but always had good stuff now finally seems to have clicked
@bradbgsu yeah time will tell but he always had the stuff finally seems to have clicked
@walkswillhaunt that Detroit game he was actually better than the line suggests he worked out of jams with some nasty pitches
@walkswillhaunt in his last 8 starts he has given up 7 ER 59 K's
@bradbgsu in his last eight starts he has given up more than 1 ER only once (4 vs Det) that is ace numbers
@walkswillhaunt true but he has been filthy all season just waited too long to put him in rotation
@ejtoth i wish my life stayed on that low defintion at all times lol
If we can get some offense this offseason look out we have two legitimate #1 starters now in Carrasco and Kluber
@realroygbiff @bradbgsu he is on couples therapy right now on vh1 it's awesome!
@bradbgsu if any of these fools were smart they would take her to the end she has no chance of winning
@bradbgsu bye bye Frankie!
i usually wait to get the new iOS update until my apps won't work without it #fearchange
