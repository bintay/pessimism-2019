I'm so comfortable around my mum I flash her my boobs and twerk in front of her. She calls me "a freak of nature" lmaoooooooo
@savage_tackz shh..... Don't talk.
@CourtsChorus thanks baby <WEARY FACE><TWO HEARTS>
I'm that chick that prefers to hang with boys instead of girls. I don't know I just get really frustrated. I'm such a girly tomboy
@savage_tackz shh baby. I remember everything.
I'm just a passionate woman.
Apparently I'm a drama queen..... Well I've always wanted to be an actress <SMIRKING FACE>
My mother raised me well i must admit.
I do thank my mother for taking me to art exhibitions and museums since I was a little child. you've made me so creative and open minded.
My mother has left apart of her soul in me. I'm like a miniature of her! I'm such a spiritual, artsy, hippie.
Who wants to accompany me and go to art galleries and coffee shops and shit. My mothers been taking me all my life. I'm just so used to it.
Who gives a fuck anyway. Crazy chicks are the best.
Maybe I am a little over possessive <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I remember when my little sister was starting primary school
And all my little school friends got excited and went up to her to talk to her, and I got very angry and told them to go away and leave her.
I've been the possessive type since I was a little kid.
Don't get it fucked up though, I'm never jealous towards girls and shit. Only towards loved ones
Yes I am the jealous type.
BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND WERE CRAZY.
Like even with my soul sister, we only fuck with each other... If one of us does something without each other we get jealous <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I can be so possessive and jealous
I'm such a crazy chick.
I don't anwser to unknown. SO FUCK OFF AND TRY AGAIN
Lmao why doesn't @DaRealAmberRose notice me? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm trying everything dawg.
@DaRealAmberRose I wanna touch yo booty then slap your cute head <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Sweet pussy saday. 
@Jmzofficial your a prick
I feel so blessed sometimes when I reminisce about my past and notice how far I've come.
I think I like who I'm becoming... I'm more in touch with my spiritual side. I'm so optimistic and genuinely happy.
I've been so misunderstood
I've come such a long way.
I can be such a cold bitter person. Just angry with the world. Various things really. But time heals and I've become better over the years.
FUCK A NIGGA. IM SELF MADE
Sometimes I hate it
@MyNiggaPolo wow

That's so sad.
She said she got bullied in school for having autism
I did indeed cry for her
This woman that works in a charity shop I go to has autism, who is 23 years old and has never had a boyfriend. I cried
It's like, once you've got or done that certain thing, your like "oh" and then straight away your onto the next thing
I have to be strong and do things in my own time otherwise I'm just going to be in a rush. Why are we all rushing ? What's the rush?
Sometimes I get an urge to do certain things just to feel satisfied and say "I've done that" but that's just delaying gratification.
It's kinda annoying sometimes because I'll meet someone and once I find out their star sign I already know what they're like.
I'm into star signs and I expect you to be interested in them too.
SHE SAID I'LL BE GOOD AT THAT
I said to my mum I occasionally fantasise about flipping bricks, being a stripper or having a sugar daddy
I occasionally strip in front of my mum
Their captions be deep but they shallow as a puddle ....
I sometimes get annoyed when I see these Insta famous girls who are clearly basic yet no one seems to acknowledge this. Everyone is deluded
I'm shy af yet confident af 
It's complicated 
I'm complicated
Maybe I come across as intimidating.
Maybe they simple cannot handle me.
A lot of people look away when I look at them but I honestly don't know why.
I love eye contact.... I wanna see through your soul. Don't look away. Let me study you
I've been procrastinating so much today and I haven't got any fucking work done and I feel awful but still here I am tweeting away.

I'm such a glamour puss who demands the world and everything in it.
But fashion will never stay the same. Fashion changes, re invents itself, modernises, expands.
How awesome would it be if everyone was to dress impeccable on a normal day to day basis? Like we were in the 50's again???
I wish sometimes I were born in the 50's and fell in love and looked glamorous all the time and attended spectacular ballroom party's.
Im that type of woman that walks around naked in the house, surrounded by cats, with Incense burning, and jazz music playing.
Treat them mean to keep them keen.
Maybe In my past life I was an Egyptian goddess who was quite demanding and insensitive to men's needs and desires
Im a diva. I expect to be waited on. My soulmate will have to treat me like an Egyptian goddesses <CROWN>
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>

@CourtsChorus I like that ear stretcher, and your septum, and your lip colour, and your jacket. Just the whole picture really <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Everyone in my class considers the guy weird, crazy, and annoying. But he just try's to express himself to people, in every way possible.
And this is why I say.... 
To be understood is to feel accepted.
But the most important thing is, he said he feels accepted by me.
Maybe I was a gift to him.
He says I remind him of his mum which he no longer sees.
He speaks of things to me he has never ever told anyone before.
He tells me his secrets. He lets me in, into his life, and his past, and his future.
He feels accepted by me because I understand him.
Everyone in my class considers our fellow class mate absolutely insane. But I get him. I feel his frequency and his vibes that he lets off.
We're not accepted. Not really
But are we accepted? That's the question.
I understand people. 
I understand you, and I understand I. 
To be understood is to feel accepted.
I need someone just as insane as me.
She is always on planet Neptune. 
I am a god. And so are you
He took my presence for granted... So I took it away. 
@Jmzofficial trying to. Lol

Eye contact is deadly... A lot of people can't look me dead in the eye, or say I'm intimidating by the way I look at them lmaoooo
I do this shit where I just pierce my eyes into people's soul, and not look away until I feel like it
I love it when I act awkward with people purposely just to see their reaction.... Amazing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@90sGoldBaby_ I've been feeling like this too recently..

I'm just a little obsessed with the Egyptians and extraterrestrials..... How can you not be? All this knowledge they have left us with.
If I was to tell someone theirs extraterrestrials they would consider me absurd and think I'm popping Molly.
The government just wants us all to be brainwashed dummies with no conscious.
Everything links. Theirs a meaning for this all
Extraterrestrials ... Egypt. 
The Egyptians believed the pyramids was a gateway to the after life and to other dimensions.... Let's Praise the extraterrestrials <EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN>
We are not alone. <EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN>
Of course their are extraterrestrials. I believe they helped the Egyptians to build the pyramids.

I hate when my dealer is late to give me my weed.
I hate when I smile at girls and they turn their heads
I hate when males think you wanna suck their dick when really your just being nice.
I hate when boys wanna be more than friends and I just wanna chill and kick it with them.

@KingOfTheLights still waiting for my black knight to come sweep me of my feet.
Damn pussies

Kiy for Jon Riosa at day 4 of @FashionArtTO 
They've literally turned their heads when I give them eye contact.... 
Why?
I've observed a lot of white men watch me when I go out but are too scared to start a conversation with me.
Some males are intimidated by me. Maybe it's the way I talk, or the way I walk, or the way I think. 
@KiallAlexander same. I think it's called having a weird sense of humor
I've been through the wars
I also have a scar under my eyebrow from when I fell and banged my face on the edge of a table.... Yeah I remember everything. Clumsy me
I actually have a bump on my lip that looks like I've got punched up... Lol I've had it since I was a little kid <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> clumsy me.

He lives in California too 
And drives a Chevy Malibu
Decisions decisions.......
Torn between going to uni, getting the right links &amp; contacts for fashion, maybe going into debt or just risking it and doing things my way
I feel so honoured that I'm guaranteed a place at London college of fashion. 
Funny thing is, I'm not quite sure if I even want to go uni
Tailoring is actually quite complex!
This man charges over £850 just for one of his suits.
It's great to see a black man doing what he loves the most. Teaching at one of the most popular fashion universities in London...
I felt so proud of him. 
I barely knew the man.
The most ironic thing is, he went to the very same college I study at, and he was studying plumbing and realised one day it wasn't for him
I went on a workshop at London college of fashion and met a humours black man that taught tailoring at the university for 10 years
Surrounded by people that don't even take that much interest in fashion... Why the fuck you on a fashion course?
Studying fashion isn't as fun as it sounds. 
Such a demanding intense course.
Not everyone will understand me. 
But to understand someone is quite an amazing quality to have...
I like being misunderstood, but at the same time hate it.
I like people who are interested in different things in life.
I love passionate soulful people who are free spirited and don't give a fuck.
@LanaLondon_ it truly is amazing !!!!
Thank you my sexy mamiiiiiii <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>

That's what comes with us crazy quiet shy chicks... The unexpected <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>

Write your girl random love letters.
Explore her mind.
Is it just me or is Ciara just looking more and more like a white lady these days?

@BigGkSg and vice versa.
I'm that chick that you go to, to ask for girl advice lol ha
@BigGkSg it's sad really, females just need to learn to understand males and their ways of thinking lol
I think males are just misunderstood. Black males especially.
I like guys because they tell it how it is. They will argue then make up 10 minutes later. They're softies really.
My mother thought I was getting bullied <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Girls aren't down when it comes to play fighting.... I used to come home from school with bruises on my arms ha
I was that one girl that chilled with the squad of guys, it has its up's and downs... Not very nice getting punched in the vagina.
In school everyone considered me weird but still hung out with me, why? Because weird girls are the best <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
I'm just in my own world.
My personality is too much to handle for some people, I know now....
@ItsRichCj she's amazing! Always loved her photo shoots <FIRE>
I remember when I used to ask my guy friends if I seem approachable... They all said I look mean. Honestly, you guys need to grow a pair <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
A lot of people say I'm intimidating by the way I look at em... sorry. It's just that your eyes are the window to your soul.
@KiallAlexander this your cat?<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Easy to get caught up in your thoughts
Everyone's in their own world
I observe people all the time. On the train, on the bus, at college etc. It's pretty cool observing people's behaviour
I'm literally so chill about everything. It's a good thing and a bad thing I guess... I don't let things overcome me.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Why don't people just delay gratification?
Everyone's in a rush in life... Why?
Maybe I am a diva but my mother needs to chill. I need to rest for atleast an hour before I clean.
So bored right now. Too weak to move <WEARY FACE>
I always say I'm ready for summer and get over excited, but when summer actually comes I'm like..... Winter where art thou?

I've always been the type to just do crazy shit and never look back. It's awesome
Live like your about to die tomorrow
Do some fucking soul searching. Find out who you are. Go to art galleries. Go to different areas / country's. Do spontaneous shit.
People are born into a world with pathetic rules and start to follow them, and get brainwashed by it all. Follow your heart.
While your still living, do whatever you want! Fucking live with no regrets, go out and make moves. But of course live with courtesy.

I do admire Kanye west style in fashion, and a few of his songs. But I have to slander him for his arrogance and mindset at times.
But then again, it's debatable really.
I cannot comprehend how a black man can approve of such monstrosity <CONFUSED FACE>
Who's heard about Kanye west approving a white french fashion designer name his latest collection "last niggas in Paris"
