can we just talk about Silver forever please
I love how when I type Silver's name on my phone the next suggested word is automatically 'cute'
@EduConnectionz NOOOOO WHAT IS THIS LOOK HOW CUTE HE IS I'M SMILING SO MUCH THANK U
now I'm imagining Silver and Free marrying while she wears the tuxedo and he wears the dress. perfect
@Electro_Husky SURE also silver will be the bride so maybe ask him
I just had to RT that I'm really sorry but it's just so hilarious to me even tho I don't even fully get it
being as beautiful as Silver should be illegal honestly
@silverfuckr i like this tbh
my icon is killing me it's too good
@fehck i watched that movie for the first time when I was like 9 or 10 lol rip
I should try to get my mind out of the gutter
idk where this idea just came from but I wanna draw a pic of Silver pole-dancing
pissbaby is one of my favourite words of all time
@fehck jet is a fuckin douchebag and also a pissbaby. I love him
man your icon omg I love that movie I'm getting all nostalgic here @fehck
I have to mention Silver in every conversation no matter the topic, like
"hey did you see that movie" "Yes did you see how cute Silver is"
@fehck all I'm doing is lying the fuck down and thinkin of how cute silver is 8')
*kisses screen when I see Silver* that's my boyfriend just fyi
@K7G4P11 THIS IS TOO BEAUTIFUL I MIGHT DIE WOWIE you just made my day
alright enough complaining, fuck it all
who even cares anymore that I'm dead emotionally AND physically lol
did I turn 80 lately without me noticing or what happened
really good to know that 99% of the pain I feel comes from my back
oh yeah i visited a doctor today and he said my hearing being so bad has to do with my back too 8) NICE
also I'm still at my dad's place, I'm coming home tomorrow but I just needed a rest idk
My back always hurts but this burning sensation is new and it's killing me :') this is worse than everything else honestly
Idk if I can sleep with this pain but I have to try so good night orz
I can't even lie down without my back hurting what is this
*casually follows everyone who has a Silver icon*
@Electro_Husky @RakugakiSquid THE BAE
@mizkepler i feel u
so how are you guys doing I HOPE YOUR EXAMS ARE GOING WELL
I'm sick of having to be here so often I just wanna stay in my room at home honestly
I wish I was home rn so I could draw ugh
I'm so fuckin bored rn I'm at my dad's place and he just keeps sitting around doing nothing like jfc I'm dying of boredom here
if yOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN alright bye
my icon together with my @ looks like "heh you fuckin know it"
@TheBlueComet1 thank u I'm glad
now I'm too pumped to go to bed gdi but I have to so GOOD NIGHT
I feel like this icon perfectly represents me and how I feel thank u
HOW COULD I RESIST MAKING THIS MY ICON IT'S PERFECTION
that site honestly killed me rn I waited for so long I NEED TO MAKE THAT ONE PANEL MY ICON I JUST HAVE TO
what's not to love about this 
@EduConnectionz P L E ASE
@EduConnectionz imagine him "rapping" like she does omfghfghg that'd be toO MUCH WOULDNT IT
@EduConnectionz CAKERZ I'M CRYING SO HARD I'M SO GLAD I SAW THIS BEFORE I LEFT GGHDHGHJH FUCKF
like every time I cant even touch my tablet pen without dying
*draws* I'm exhausted lol
OTHERWISE IT REALLY DOESNT
DO YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DRAW SONIC CHARACTERS POSING TOGETHER LIKE YES SILVERS ARM IS WAY TOO LONG BUT IDGAF OK IT DOESNT WORK
OTP is always strong no matter the gender 
I'm suddenly tired af???? cool thanks
I think I have like 200 accounts blocked on here my god
wow great! two spam bots following me in a span of seconds!!! i'm so happy!!!!!
I need to remember to not reblog people's old art like I know the suffering
SEES MY OLD ART ON MY DASH
CASUALLY PUKES ALL OVER KEYBOARD
*sees cute drawing of Silver* someone hold me
why do I love Silver so much like how did this happen to me
let's just see how long those thoughts last cause mostly they only last like 2 days maybe 8'')
I think I've actually gotten better at drawing lately like wowie I'm surprised
this pain in my back feels like period pain tbh it's so bad I'M DYING.... it feels really hot and burns but also feels numb at the same time
how do you even draw clean lines bc I totally forgot
also it's his birthday tomorrow but he doesnt really celebrate it idk TBH I JUST WANNA STAY HOME AND SLEEP UNTIL NEXT YEAR
i just need an escape from here tho and also have some appointments together with him etc so I have to go
i also love having to go to my dad's place all the time and not being able to draw when i'm there I love it so much
mhhhh I love how I'm always so tense that I can't breathe properly!!! nice!!!!!!
@galaxysonics VERY TRUE I used to always have to do that before I figured out how this works orz
@galaxysonics YAS THANK U I hate this so much omg
@mizkepler YES THAT WAS IT thank u I just forgot cause I couldnt find the german word for it anymore im dumb
this shit really gets my blood boiling like my god I wanted to draw but now I'm jUST FUCKING PISSED OFF
theres something you have to enter in the searchbar on the start menu to get to the drivers and stuff but I forgot how it works rip
it's like some asshole just doesnt want me to draw
my pen pressure stopped working for the first time in 500 years and I totally forgot how to fix it :,)
I made that joke before but it's still accurate af
@EduConnectionz THIS LOOKS GOOD FOR THREE YEARS OLD THO WTF I WISH I COULD SEE YOUR NEWER STUFF TOO
@sanjitoofancy TRU but that's not the case here fortunately
@EduConnectionz GOOD I CANT WAIT
rejecting people is really difficult I feel like a fucking dickbag
@13aymax I'M GLAD SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS
I really love Scourge, he's the biggest piece of trash I have ever seen
I saw some really cute art of vanilla and cream and i wanna reblog it but I cant
I would draw a cute pic in honor of today if I didnt hate today so much if you know what I mean
@silverfuckr nice typo that I just noticed btw
@fleetwaysonikku MAYBE but I'm not that big of a fan tbh
@SarcasmBKD I WILL AND THEN WE CAN MEME ABOUT IT ALL DAY
@EduConnectionz CAN YOU PLEASE DR AW THISH
Sonic is the prime example of course but also Sly Cooper and Starfox and MANY MORE
@SarcasmBKD I DONT UNDERSTAND THESE REFERENCES BUT IM STILL LAUGHINGg
how to make me play a game: put cure furries in it
@JinriTwinTailed I didnt say I would lol they can go suck it
@tfwlelouch I FUCKING LOVE TSUNDERES MY GOD THEY ARE GAY
falco is definitely gonna be my fave I love him already honestly
@tfwlelouch thats what I thought too and I LOVE IT
everyone seems to hate starfox adventures but I thought it looked kinda cool??? idk i wanna play it tbh
talk fox/falco to me pls
@tfwlelouch I love douchebag characters tho so I dont mind LMAO. also idk maybe they had more interaction in another game? hmm
@JinriTwinTailed ABSOLUTELY
mhhh yes I love getting yelled at while I'm trying to distract myself and improve my mood somehow
and Krystal is REALLY BEAUTIFUL she reminds me of Carmelita from Sly Cooper ahhhhh my god i'm such a fucking furry
like fox and falco are sO GODDAMN CUTETOGETHER WOWIE I LOVE THEM????? I HAVENT EVEN PLAYED THE GAME AND STILL
tbh I wanna play star fox just because of the cute furries everywhere and gay ship potential like damn they are adorable
@silverfuckr @EduConnectionz DO YOU RMEMEBRB
***CAKERZ
I just remembered riggy azalea and I'm fuckingng crinyyngn CAKERT DO YOU REMEMBER OH MY GOOGS
@EduConnectionz ME TOO TBH THANK YOU FOR OPENING MY EYES
I dont even do the lineart anymore most of the time, I just correct the sketch lol rip
@EduConnectionz LITERALLY SAME
@spicygaysammi fhdghagh thank you ;O; YOU TOO
@JinriTwinTailed ah thank you ;; same goes for you heh
@silverfuckr look at this yo
I dont know how it's possible to care so much and so little at the same time
@fleetwaysonikku what else is new tbh
same with silver. silver the hedgeHOE. not like it's not tru or anything
I keep accidentally typing "sonic the hedgeho"
will I ever be happy again, I really wonder
@EduConnectionz THANK U &lt;3
yes please turn up the volume on the tv even more I love it so much
I'm gonna go eat something orz
I hate my life atm and I know things will just get shittier from here on because I have to be a "responsible adult" but I just can't
then you get older and you both start to alienate yourself from them and you drift apart and it's just really sad
I keep thinking of one friend I used to have when I was like 12 like WE HAD THE BEST TIMES TOGETHER BUT
I'm in a really bad mood today I just get sad over everything lately
@EduConnectionz SAME I just cant stand all the drama anymore
I have absolutely no idea how sites like gaiaonline and so on work like I'M SO CONFUSED
I mostly just use it to upload my art, reblog other people's art or reblog funny stuff to make ppl laugh that's all really
tumblr pisses me off so much atm why do I still go on there
when I post a dumb meme I drew in 5 minutes everyone and their neighbour reblogs it but when I actually put effort into something? NAH SON
I hate twitter, I waste so much time on here and mostly just with complaining
me @ myself: please never put that much time into useless shit like that ever again
some redesigns of Silver and Blaze, finally done 8') original file size and description here 
I need to learn how to shut the fuck up honestly
i'm not a big fan of birthdays either tbh I don't really care about mine idk I'm probably sounding like a cynical asshole here
why do we need certain days to celebrate certain people, like if someone's a good person you celebrate them every day without a reason
@fehck no it was more like "hey I got some ice cream for you just close your eyes" OH NICE" goodbye
@fehck I dont even want to explain it
yes I have very grown-up humor I kno
if anyone wants to know, that line continues with "turns out that I actually had just blown that dude" lol BYE FRIENDS
I just threw an anger fit thanks to my shitty as fuck internet not working like EVER and hurt my foot really badly my god take me to hell
@fehck we all know, dont we
I dont need to draw anything else for this anymore cause this one wins honestly 
I'M SUCH A SINNER GOODBYE MY FRIENDS
*sees drawing of Silver being hurt and bruised and bleeding* yes. g o o d
I'm embarassing yes but idgaf anymore
@ LRT YES............
ソニクラ様フォロー20～？人くらいしかいないのでこれを気に知って頂けると！
別ジャンル描いてましたがソニックやっぱりサイコー 
@punkhog HAVE FUN
me five minutes ago: hey, my back actually feels fine right now!
me now: send help
the earlier I wake up the more sad I am honestly
@KawaiiBee THANK U
@NotAFangirrl I KNOW IT'S PERFECT and Silver is the best
@JinriTwinTailed but im gay af too
and I'm talking about the version with Arnold Schwarzenegger of course aka the guy who looks like my dad LMAO
I kind of want to watch Total Recall again it's one of my fave movies ever
@Hinkinsan happy birthday!!! &lt;3
@NotAFangirrl thank you ;O;
@posilutelysoa also I ship her so goddamn hard with Tails it hurts like i made that super embarassing AMV of them back then bye
@posilutelysoa she used to be my fave female character and one of my favourite characters in general SHE'S PERFECT
I still rly like that drawing tbh I was proud of it back then lol
do you guys remember this drawing bc I STILL need to finish it 
have I ever mentioned how much I love Cosmo
I wanna watch seinfeld bc it's hilarious from what I've seen but it has 180 episodes and the episodes are like 100 gb big bye
me: I'm gonna draw today!
my back: no
my head: no
my hands: no
literally everything and everyone: no
I feel so dizzy like I'm gonna faint what is this
@spicygaysammi RIP US
@spicygaysammi tbh I just have a huge headache too rip
I'm gonna fall asleep any second someone give me the strength to keep drawing
also i'm tired af all of a sudden lol k
I get these weird phases where I feel so dead inside I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore and it's worse than anything else
guys please shoot me plEASE I'M DYING
hmhmhmhmmm I cant wait till i'm tired of Splatoon before the game even came out thanks to all the hype thanks
everything bores me lately, like you could come and shoot me in the face and I'd be like alright can we do something else this is boring
I have so many things to do but I just feel bored no matter what I'm doing I feel like I'm slowly dying on the inside
I'M SO FUCKING BORED OUT OF MY MIND SEND HELP
are people actually not online bc they're seriously studying because I'm impressed then since I never really studied a day in my life rip
my drawing process is 10 % drawing and 90 % complaining
I can already feel a writers cramp coming I'm dyin
there's 9 silvers on this page and im still not done help me
people often tell me my drawing style is unique but I don't really see it honestly I APPRECIATE IT A LOT THO IT MAKES ME HAPPY
@NotAFangirrl thanks 8)
@HunterTSF THANK
i thought since Silver's quills are long when he's a guy it'd be nice to give her short quills when she's a girl idk I think it's cute
also Silver is still hella gay when being a girl obviously
you can also see them as being trans I don't mind either way it's all good
I dont do that at all I just draw them how they would look in an AU or whatever if they had the opposite gender that's all
ppl: drawing genderswapped versions of characters is just there to give them cliché traits depending on their gender and-
me: no
female Silver bc yes 
S U C C E S S
an artist I really like watched me after I was just thinking "I hope they watch me" the other day LMAO NICE
my computer and especially my screen are so loud they give off this weird buzzing sound IT'S SO ANNOYING
I can't start with the whole "I'm gonna try to gain weight"-thing anyways until I left this place
I'm just gonna eat some cereal or something who even cares
everything the dumb whore cooks tastes so shitty to me I really dont wanna eat it but I'm not allowed to make anything else either
@Ashiteshi ARE YOU A GOD OR SOMETHING WOW YOU ARE GORGEOUS WTF
it's never hurt this bad before please kill me
oh my god my back i'm not kidding I'm gonna die at this rate what is this
@HunterTSF IDIOT........
@HunterTSF SHOULDNT YOU KNOW IT'S ENGLISH
if she asks for something this year all she's gettin is a fist to the face
best thing is I'm def gonna get yelled at and guilt-tripped again tomorrow like every year like nothing is ever good enough anyways
like sorry for being a pissbaby but it just makes me mad I'm done
@HunterTSF x') YES
also watch out dont look at m gross selfies unless you want to see em LOL SOBS
@GideonDrake fhgdgsag t-thank you ;o;...... cries
@HunterTSF SHUT UP FUCKO
sees mothers day shit all over the internet lol ok I'm just going to leave now
I'm gross &amp; I'm lame trash like don't even bother please
why would anyone even be interested in me at all like especially romantically or whatever I'm so
I still dont know what to reply to that person on tumblr who said they have a crush on me like idfk I'm so?????? CONFUSED
@posilutelysoa I dont like any of it tbh THE OLD EPISODES ARE THE BEST but I like how the current ones look too (Im at like 140)
@posilutelysoa I'm honestly scared too i dont like how the new eps look either like the newer they get the uglier they are kinda
@posilutelysoa I BET I WILL
MY GOD @ MY BACK PLEASE STOP I'M BEGGING YOU
I REALLY LOVE THAT IT'S SO FUN IDK
that probably sounds like i'm being full of myself but solving puzzles &amp; shit like in professor layton is actually something I'm rly good at
@posilutelysoa I LOVE THAT TOO but I like trying to find out who's the murderer and shit too that makes it rly fun to me it's like a puzzle
especially with conan I always try to remember every little detail that happened cause it always turns out to be important
also that's just the way movies and shows go like nothing happens without a reason and you have to be suspicious of everyone and everything
@posilutelysoa THAT MAKES IT MORE FUN I GUESS SO THAT'S ACTUALLY COOL
@posilutelysoa tru tbfh
@xLuminii I like the last one most, the blue shoes make it pop more and are a nice addition :o
I KNEW IT FROM THE START IT WAS SO OBVIOUS HE WAS //WAY// TOO NICE AND ACTED ALL INNOCENT LIKE NAH FUCKO
like i was watching frozen for the first time &amp; the first scene where hans appeared I was already like oh he's the villain he just acts nice
I honestly figure stuff out in movies and shows etc pretty often before it even happens it makes it kinda boring sometimes
that happened with other cases too before and I'm always like SCREAMS AT OWN ASS
I know they do it to make it more exciting and add suspense but it drives me nuts sometimes
meanwhile i sit here like guys please pL EA SE E IT'S SO OBVIOSUSL
I really hate that like sometimes I sit in front of the tv watching cone and they act so dense like conan acts like a fucking idiotsometimes
MY GOD GUYS IT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE CAMERA GUYS YOU FUCKOS PLEASE IT'S SO OBVIOUS
they had to find out who it was and kept looking in the audience and I WANTED TO SCREAM AT THE TV CAUSE I WAS LIKE
I was watching a Conan episode where there was a guy in a football stadium who wanted to randomly shoot someone in the audience and
ps2 games are the best honestly
tho lying down hurts too so I have no clue what to do
like I wanted to draw all day today and finally finish that ref sheet but sitting here hurts so much I'm literally dead
I can barely stand upright and my back feels like hell but aside from that I'm fine really all is good
I have to go eat something but idfk what ugh send help
how to NOT draw shoes, a book by me
since sonic character's bodies are too small and stuff it would look weird idk
on the original pic they wear two sweaters, one tied around their necks and one around their hips but that'd be too much
I'll color it too DONT WORRY I'M JUST SO LAZY
how about THIS 
@posilutelysoa same honestly
@ people who can actually afford merchandise: how
I dont allow many ppl to touch me like not even family or close friends most of the time but with Soa it'd be perfectly fine thank u bae
@posilutelysoa I WOULD HAVE TO MARRY YOU THEN SORRY
please stab my back so it stops hurting maybe please I cant take this
@xLuminii I HOPE I DIDNT SOUND RUDE OR SOMETHING THO this design looks v cool
@posilutelysoa we are old fucks
@sanjitoofancy DEFINITELY NOT FRIENDO
the original version is so much nicer than the techno remix tbh 
@xLuminii or add a bit more colors maybe if you can, like with Silver, his fur is grey so he has some bright colors like turqoise, gold,blue
@xLuminii I would consider making the orange more bright maybe to make the rest pop out more since it looks to dull otherwise :o
I act like a teen and I look like one too so knowing that I'm over 20 makes me feel weird and I hate it
in one month and a day I'm 23 what even is this I'm still a child
like a song from the 80s comes on and I'm like HELL YEAH HELL FUCKIN YEAH!!!!!!!! and everyone else my age is like ?????? wtf
so when people who are like 30-50 get all nostalgic about songs I always join in cause I understand and it makes me feel like a geezer
the 70s - 90s even tho I wasn't even born then or still a baby lmao
my dad used to have so many old music videos on vhs tapes and we always watched them so I get all sentimental when I hear songs from like
ive never heard the word wuthering before it sounds weird af but I learned something new again so YAY
it's not even the content of the video like thew story is really cliché I know but THE WAY IT'S MADE IS SO UNIQUE AND SO OLD-FASHIONED
@posilutelysoa AGREED I used to ride on them when i was younger and once I fell down a hill bc of one thanks
I always had that picture in my head of those palm trees at night with the neon lights and the comic book graphics and aaaaa it's so cool
THIS IS IT IF YOU WANNA KNOW I LOVE IT 
and NOW I FOUND IT AGAIN AFTER LIKE???? ALMOST 20 YEARS?????? FUCK I'M OLD GOODBYE
it's always been in the back of my head I was always looking for it and had pictures of it in my head but that was all I knew
I rediscovered an old music video I used to always watch with my dad when I was a kid and it made me so goddamn happy you have NO IDEA
you have no idea how much my nickname means to me
like I remember I used to dislike her for no reason but nah I was dumb SHE'S ADORABLE AND REALLY NICE AND HER SONGS ARE GREAT OK
Taylor Swift is so cute wtf
@sonknux I KNOW RIGHT
@miguelisasir well THAT'S different, those are generally nice from my experience
galahad........... my bae...............
am I the only one who thinks horses are creepy
AND THEN I HAVE TO USE MY TABLET BUT I CANT REACH MY KEYBOARD WELL WHEN I DO AND I JUSTZHGHHGGD KILL ME
I GET SO FUCKING MAD WHEN MY MOUSE DOESNT WORK LIKE IT NEVER WORKS PROPERLY AT ALL I'M GOING TO KILL SOMEONE
there's like a burning sensation just IN THE MIDDLE of my shoulderblades it's so bad kill me
ok my back is being extra shitty on me today like it hurts SO MUCH????? I JUST GOT UP WHAT IS THIS

@silverfuckr **how wtf
@silverfuckr I love his accurate this actually turned out to be I'm sitting here doin nothing and eating candy
please just stop it makes me feel so horrible and ugly it's not my fault that I'm underweight it's just the stress and everything
but when someone's chubby or fat you dont say WOW YOURE SO FAT YOU SHOULD LOSE SOME WEIGHT
when youre skinny ppl always so oh youve lost weight you look so sick please gain some weight
I feel like I look really sick and everyone always says OH YOU'RE SO THIN ETC ETC like please stop please
oh right i took some selfies but idk if I wanna show them I feel gross fghgdgh
also my internet connection sucks ass so bad lately like it barely works properly
the internet is literally dead lately how long will this last I'm dying
@japhetgrindr I'M OK HBU
@miguelisasir either way IT'S BEAUTIFUL
I wish deviantart would notify you if you get mentioned on someone's da page too
to be on that list with only five other people and one of them being my fave artist makes me cry honestly goodbye
GUYS I CRY LOOK AT THIS 
@EduConnectionz I'M GLAD it's actually based on some post on tumblr but it fits better with Silver honestly
@miguelisasir no it'd be シルバーファッカ since it's a name
I'm finally on my computer I'm crying but I'm also tired af gdi
I just got home, I can't wait till I get on the computer to draw. and by draw I mean sit around lazily and eat candy
@galaxysonics OHHHH BEAUTIFUL BBY happy visibility day to you too &lt;3
I just got 500 mb data yesterday and it's already over 80% gone wtf the fuck I didn't even do much
@EduConnectionz LITERALLY MY LIFE THO LMAO
Sunday will be hell, I can't wait till my "mom" guilt-trips me again for not getting her anything. you don't deserve it tho bitch fuck u
Silver: *exists*
me: holy shit do that again
I just fell asleep while lying on my phone and with the lights still on and everything lmao good night
I'm honestly the worst at making decisions
OR I could try the middle way and move in here for a while till I get my own flat cause getting one is more difficult and takes longer
also I have another appointment on Monday and I still have to decide if it's better if I move in with my dad or try to get my own flat
I took some gross selfies too I'll show u guys tomorrow
We also had some ice cream and pizza and talked a lot yesss it was nice
today was very long and exhausting day but also fun bc my stepmom and I bought some new clothes (well she bought them for me lmao)

@SilverHeckr I'm glad you dont follow my nsfw account tho thatd make it 5000 times worse
@SilverHeckr I TAKE ALL THE BLAME I REALLY AM A BAD INFLUENCE

@JinriTwinTailed I WILL OMG GOOD IDEA I just still need to get a plushy of him and I'm poor lmao
@JinriTwinTailed yeah or maybe they're so smart and have giant brains or something
one day I will be pretty and post a selfie every day just you wait and see
@JinriTwinTailed oh ok, I thought there was like a reason they have huge foreheads LOL
@JinriTwinTailed how does it make sense :o
I'm trying to find Sonic contests on dA but all of them already ended like wtf show me the new ones then fucko
@JinriTwinTailed they're like twice as big as the rest of their head omfg

@miguelisasir AAAAAA THANK U THAT'S SO CUTE you know what I like omfg
I know that won't undo it but I still wanna say it and I wanna better myself and try to not be so salty all the time lmao
@JinriTwinTailed yeah I didn't make it very clear sorry :'o
btw I'm sorry if I accidentally said anything insulting lately I'm just super salty at the moment  and can't word my thoughts well
@JinriTwinTailed sorry for the confusion haha I CERTAINLY DONT HATE EVERY BOY ON THIS PLANET
when did I get so gay I'd really like to know
@JinriTwinTailed no just like when a boy in real life is hitting on me I HATE THAT
for real though it's like when a boy tells me he thinks I'm pretty I'm just like "ok" but when a girl does it I'm like "!!!!! HOLY SHIT!!!!"
also the fact that it's a girl and not a boy lmao I hate rl boys fuck u
MY EGO HAS BEEN BOOSTED THANK U CUTE PERSON
I'll have to think of a reply but that kinda cheered me up rn wtf that's so nice
I CANT EVEN COMPREHEND THIS RN THAT'S SO ADORABLE I JUST
oh jeez someone on tumblr sent me an ask saying she wants me to be her girlfriend and I think she's being serious omfg THAT'S SO CUTE WTF???
I just wanna feel like I'm productive by posting wips of the same pic over and over again IM SORRY I HAVENT FINISHED ANYTHING IN DAYS
this is my fave Silver face ive ever drawn I think lmao 
@13aymax I'M LAUGHIGNGGHh I'm sorry but also Silver is my only tru boyfriend don't worry he's still #1
F E N R I S  my boyfriend
I'd rather fucking kill myself than be like her goodfuckinbye
oh also I forgot to mention this but the stupid whore also said I should be less like my father and MORE LIKE HER AND I'M???? LAUGHING????
also sorry for cursing so much I'm a really bad role model
goddamn her I hope she gets struck by lightning tomorrow or something idfk
mghnhghhgh I'm still mad about the shit that stupid whore said earlier I just can't get it out of my head I just
@RakugakiSquid I have never met anyone who does maybe like really rich people but otherwise nope we have to suffer
I hope you guys all know that I love you very much ok
@13aymax YEAH I'M STUNNED HONESTLY
I'll do my best even though I probably won't win but one can try I GUESS
I have no clue how anyone can afford doing a contest like that but ok
@13aymax actually it's almost 2000 omfg
I definitely wanna try that I mean wtf event he third place is A LOT OF MONEY WHAT THE HELL AND I NEED IT RN
YOOOO GUYS if you need some money you should really look at this (future) contest omg 
@posilutelysoa if you cant be on the computer we can also talk another time tho omg I should go to bed soon anyways
@posilutelysoa YEAH I mentioned that too omg I loved that
@posilutelysoa YEAH ME TOO. and I'm glad I just didnt accidentally skip an episode or something tho
@posilutelysoa YES we should talk on skype if u want are u online
@HybridAllowance thanks again ;o;! I hope so too aaaaa
but yeah in general I just think conan is rly good when it comes to gender stuff
there was something else I wanted to mention but I forgot gdi
OH AND HEIJI IS GAY that too
also in another episode there was a trans guy it was so nice
I mean just the anime in general seems rly nice to me when it comes to that kinda stuff and idk how to explain it
on that one photograph" and no one said anything like "wow that's weird" or "ew gay" or something lmao it was really nice
I watched a lot of cone today and it made me rly happy because there was like one guy who just casually mentioned "I dressed up as a woman
@posilutelysoa watch those episodes or something
@posilutelysoa I just watched the episodes where Ai appears for the first time today and I was so confused???? lol I thought I forgot to
@HybridAllowance THANKS I appreciate it &lt;3
I hope I'm not getting too hopeful and optimistic here I really hope this won't be too difficult. the whole movin out thing I mean
@HybridAllowance I WILL THANK U
@posilutelysoa I WAS WATCHING THAT EPISODE TODAY AND????? I THOUGHT I MISSED SOMETHING????? did that just not happen or did I forget
@posilutelysoa I KNOW RIGHT. I did get it 100 % right like two or three times tho that was so noice
I mean no one tells me anything but the whore did say without my mobile phone I wont be able to access it and idk if she meant now or what
also I'm not sure but my internet might stop working at 10pm again like it used to I really dont know
idk if that was the word they used I cant remember but it was hilarious
or I could do it like they did on south park, just call the police and tell them they "molestered" me or something
and then I'll act like my stepdad killed her so he gets into jail yes perfect plan this is how I can get rid of them both
@13aymax EXCELLENT IDEA
or I even knew what happened before it happened
I'm honestly kinda proud tbh cause there's like ten cases in conan that I solved all on my own while watching it hehe
no one would find out bc no one in rl is as smart as conan or can figure that shit out
ive been watching so much detective conan lately maybe I should try using one of those weird methods to kill my mom lmao
pats myself on the back well done
I wanted to finish a drawing but I got ABSOLUTELY NOTHING done today
@RakugakiSquid THANKS BAE I HOPE SO TOO GHGGHHGG
i dont care that I basically have to steal her
my cat loves me more than anything and I also love her more than anything it's perfect and i'm not gonna leave her here no sir
also I mean idgaf what my mom does not what my cat does lol that sounded wrong
I know where her documents are and if I have them I can act like i was the one who bought her and "owns" her
also I decided I'm just gonna take my cat Suki with me bc I ain#t leavin her here idgaf what she does
it's a miracle I didn't get a heartattack yet or something I swear this woman is killin me
ok no I need to calm down ghghhfjhff
whICH IS MAINLY YOUR FAULT BY THE WAY LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yeah excuse me that I look ill because of my non-existant mental health lmao
but the worst was when she said "I don't want to look like SHIT like you do"
she called me a coward, she said I'm "just like my dad", she said I'm a loser and that I'm crazy and so much more shit
not like she hasnt done it before but today it was really extreme
I wont let her insult me again I just cant get over this I'm so mad
it took so long to finally make this decision but I feel really relieved now
@shadowedlamp thank you &lt;3
@JinriTwinTailed unhappy and uncomfortable is an understatement haha... OTL but yeah I will, thanks ;;
that means no internet for a while and no privacy but idgaf anymore I just want to get away from here
and I might pack my things tomorrow and go to my dad's place for a month or two. I'm not sure yet, I'll have to see how the appointment goes
I was just hoping I could still save this somehow, whatever it is. but nope
well it's my fault I guess. i should have left sooner. but I'm just a naive idiot
I shouldve done this way sooner but I was a fucking idiot and thought that whore might calm down or see reason but nah I'm dumb
I'm going to an appointment tomorrow where Im gonna file an application for a flat I can move in and if I'm lucky I'm gone in a month or two
but she doesn't and this was the last straw and I'm done with her
I'm way too nice and forgiving and I've been a naive idiot to think that she would still have some decency left in her
and I decided I've really had enough now. after what happened earlier. that was the last chance I gave her and she fucking blew it again
also sorry for talking about all of this on here again, I just want you guys to know ok
I'm listening to chandelier for the 5000th time rn I really need this
@shadowedlamp yesyeseeseeYSESY THEY ARE GAY
like really I'm so thankful to Silver, he always cheers me up when I need it the most and I love him so much
I live to see Silver using his powers it makes me so fucking happy he's so amazing and cute and perfect and AAAAAAAAAAAAA
that really cheered me up right now ah good he's so cute,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this just made my day thank you Silver for being the cutest bae of all time 
everytime I think I cant get even more stressed out I do
I dont care about anything anymore I'm so goddamn dead inside
@ThatWriterKino YEAH ACTUALLY..........
one day when she finally dies I'm gonna be dancing on her grave
it just makes me wanna die I can't take it anymore
I wish *I* had never been born I dont wanna exist knowing that I only live thanks to her
idk how often I have to say this but you dont bring a child into this world just to treat it like garbage you know
I wish she had never been born honestly
I'm honestly grossed out to even be part of her family I mean the fact that she's my "mother" at least biologically grosses me out so much
she thinks I owe her for the rest of my life but no you never cared for me and you're a piece of shit
oh and "if it weren't for me you wouldn't even be here" thanks? cause my life is so great or what? I'd rather be dead
she also said i'm a "thorn in her flesh" and that she can't stand my presence anymore and shit like that I just
she wouldnt tell me what she was talking about and I really don't know what she's planning now she's like some kind of supervillain tbh
idk I have so much more to say but idk where to start and my hands wont stop shaking I cant even
she just loves terrorizing me so much like thanks now I'm panicking again what the fuck
I guess I should start keepin it in my room but ughghgh I hate doing that
and either switched the SIM cards to access it or like somehow found out how to unlock the screen
I'm kinda scared cause maybe she like..... took my phone without me knowing or something............
she also said something like "I found out something else this morning" and I just???? what's that supposed to mean wtf
it's gross as shit anyways
"dinner's ready" you know what I'd rather fuckin starve
@fehck yeah thats what she doesnt understand lmao but then again what does she understand
@espectalll123 is this really necessary
@punkhog yeah true but she'd just take pride in that tbh she loves scaring everyone
and I hate myself so much for all of this cause I wish I would have just left a few years ago when i still could
I'm so furious you have no clue how much self-control it takes to even be able to talk to her
also she said i should just leave if I werent such a coward and still "had some pride left" lmao ok tell me where I should go then
she really is so insane that she's try to hurt me and everyone else my god I cant stop shakingghhghw at is thsihs
and I cant tell anyone either cause if my dad somehow finds out HE's gonna do it probably and I'd like to not let this end in blood orz
like if I let everything out I might end up killing her for real
the thing is that I'm scared cause I know that as soon as I lose my self-control it ain't gonna end pretty
it's hilarious how she says I should "stop being a coward" and start "yelling" at her etc etc like nah I'm not a whore like you are
idk what to do anymore I just dont
my hands are shaking so much idk how I can still type this my whole body is shaking I'm going to die
I'm shaking from anger so hard right now I've lost the bit of apettite I still had I'm not even gonna eat anything today I dont care
and I'm seething with rage on the inside and you have no idea how much self control it takes to not punch her in the face
she really doesnt get it cause she thinks I'm a "coward" or something but????? no I'm just not a bad person like you are
I just feel like crying right now I wanna fuckin kill her so bad but nah I don't stoop as low as her that's what she doesnt understand
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT TO THIS????? ANY OF THIS??????????
I'M FUCKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAD??????????????????????
SHE FUCKING SAID. "IF THIS KEEPS UP THEN I'M GONNA LOOK AS UGLY AS YOU SOON!". HAHA. HAHAHHAHAHhgHAHGHGHGA
and then I was gonna say "well look at me, i'm the one who's underweight and not you" and she replies with (get ready this is real funny)
also. get this. she just said "it's your fault that i'm losing more and more weight each day, because you stress me out so much"
I try real often to make her see reason but I try it without her aggressiveness but all she knows is how to yell
I mean it doesn't matter what I say anyways? I'm just wasting my breath???? so why even bother
she says I'm a "coward" just because I'm not as aggressive as her yeah ok
also she just came into my room rn while I was writing that and insulted me really badly again what is this
what's that supposed to mean
oh and she added "and then when I took the phone from you we'll see how you're gonna access the internet without it" wtf
it's not that great anyways you can shove it up your ass for all I care
she practically forced me to take it I didnt even rly want it honestly and now she wants to take it from me alright
it was hers at first but I DIDNT EVEN WANT IT???? SO????????????
also she said if I continue with.. whatever the hell I'm doing that she doesn't like idk then she'll take away my mobile phone she gave me
I can't even reply cause she gets SUPER aggressive about it like you need to see it to be able to believe it
YOU will never forgive ME. HA. HAHAHAHAHA. ALRIGHT. NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!!!!!!!!! OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
then she suddenly yells at me for things that arent my fault saying she'll never forgive me and I just..... are you for real
and her fat husband piece of shit does fucking nothing but watch and doesnt even say hello to me or whatever he can go fuck himself
like you really dont know how loud she always gets for no fucking reason, is that really necessary
which wasnt even my fault to begin with. so
I was just standing there mindin my own business and suddenly she starts yelling at me for the shit that happened weeks ago
everything I said being an understatement
I mean I cant even say how bad it is she really hasnt talked to me normally in weeks and idfk how to explain it to anyone without
is yelling really all she can do cause that's what it feels like to me
this literally came out of nowhere what's going on what did I do now
My mom is yelling at me again for no reason what is this what the hell
idk if they made dinner yet but I'm tired of waiting so if they didn't I will
and now I have a headache too yeah this is fine real fine
can I please just gain 20 pounds like right now @ god
I wonder if dinner's ready I mean not like anyone ever tells me something
cause I've been losing more and more weight each day lately and I just wanna cry please I hate this
and the more weight I lose the worse it gets so that's just fuckin super really A++++
even when I'm just at home doin nothing I often feel like almost throwing up ughg I know this is gross I'm gomen
my stomach is REALLY sensitive I hate it so much you can't fuckin take me anywhere by car and not even by train if it's a long ride
like that feeling really is no fun at all I get supernaseous and I just wanna cry honestly I can always feel it build up and ewewewewwww
IT TAKES SO MUCH SELF-CONTROL FOR ME TO NOT THROW UP WHENEVER I DRIVE IN A CAR I HATE IT SO MUCH
the worst thing is when it's somewhere you have to go by car cause I can't even sit in a car for five minutes without almost throwing up
bc I either don't have the money for it or because i'm sick or whatever
idk so I just want to try to make her feel better and she really likes me and always wants me to come along but most of the time I can't
idk why I said them first and then she LMAO YEAH IT'S A GIRL
they have like a really shitty life like mine is fucking amazing compared to theirs haha orz so I just wanna make her happy but it's so hard
now you're probably thinkin "ok just say no then what's the big deal" but I hate saying no to them 'cause... ugh it's difficult to explain
a friend asked if I wanna go to a convention with them this weekend but holy fuck I'm really not in the mood lmao
@posilutelysoa I FAILED but yes them too holy fuck
idk it made me feel gross SO YEAH
someone blocked you or something like that but nah it was just me
also this is unrelated but I just wanted to say that I deleted my vent acc yesterday so if you followed it that's why you probably thought
I just had to pin that tweet to my page
I'm cold, hungry, and tired this is hell
the most canon sonic ships: espilver. roupaz. and then sonadow i'm sorry but it's true forgive me
I'm proud of the sonic franchise because everyone is gay as hell thank u @ god
I'm sorry but it's true it's so canon it hurts. alSO THE SECOND MOST CANON ONE IS ROUPAZ I AIN'T EVEN KIDDING
what's the most canon ship in the sonic universe you ask? sonamy? sonally? knuxouge? silvaze? tailsmo? nah I'll tell you. it's EspioxSilver
Silver is the prettiest hedgehog ever and no one can convince me otherwise
@reallygaysonic AAAAAAA I JUST SAW THIS HOLY FUCK CHILLI HOLY FUCK!!!!!!!!!! MY OT3 im done
but that really only lasted for like 10 minutes maybe
also my eyes are really burning for some reason even though when I got up today I thought I felt good or at least BETTER for once
but I'm not allowed to make something else and I just hhhhhhhhhh
make it worse probably :,,,)
my mom is makin the absolute grossest dinner today I'm dying I'm so hungry I'm gonna throw up any second but her gross "cooking" will just
HOW THE FUCK DO PEOPLE HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY GODDAMN I'M SO JEALOUS FUCK YOU

何じゃあこりゃ！<FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
夢の部屋じゃん！！！<SPARKLES><SPARKLES><SPARKLES> 
do you ever get up and think "hey today might be a good day" but then like five minutes later you already think ok nope fuck everything
@ LRT OH MY GOD CUTE AF
I'mm so fuckin pissed off rn and also feel like throwin up. cool
I get SO POSESSIVE over my fave characters I'm insane probably
MAYBE I SHOULD CHILL AND GO TO BED FOR REAL
I'M SORRY I'M SO FUCKED UP
ok but that rtyourcrush thing should really say who submitted it cause I want everyone to know Silver is mine
@JinriTwinTailed THAT'S SO NICE THANK U he is indeed mine 8)
BIG PROBLEM I KNOW BUT HE'S THE BAE AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW I'D LIKE TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO RT IT
now and I dont want it to happen when I'm not online
ok this is dumb but I wanna submit Silver to that rt your crush thing cause I dont want anyone else doin it but also I have to go to bed
@Hooru01 same LMAO
@Hooru01 I NOTICED TOO AND I AM VERY PLEASED BY THIS
alright after another failure of trying to draw something I'm gonna go to bed and watch conan and try to chill
@transtrendering IKR. its barely even a proper website if you ask me
looking at this is making me feel really nice it gives off a very special feeling 
those sponsored posts on tumblr are really pissin me off like that site gets less and less appealing to me every day
and now my internet is acting up lmao this keeps getting better and better
"I HAD A HARD DAY NOW I'M ALLOWED TO YELL AT EVERYBODY!!!!!!" please go die
like she really thinks that just bc she works she can treat everyone like shit
can act like a fucking piece of garbage human
it's hilarious how my mom thinks that just bc she works like three days a week she can act like she's oh so hard-working and automatically
ughghgh I'm so tired and also hungry again but I don't wanna leave my room since I don't wanna get yelled at again I'm so sick of this
@AsparaApparatus yES
that was fucking beautiful but also made me feel like a sinner
"oh my god, what's even happening. I'm afraid I'm gonna get YIFFED on any second" I FUCKING LOST IT
I was playing Saints Row 4 earlier and there was a part where you had to fight people in fursuits and the character you play as was like
I cry at the fact that I will never be able to afford the F4F Sonic figures
why can I only draw kinda well when I'm tired af
idk that's just kinda how I feel about them lmao I might write it on that ref sheet I'm doing since it fits
I'm pretty sure that Silver is almost always the one who starts the fights but Blaze is the one who ends them
@dlaryofjane I LIKE THIS SONG GFHUGFGHG WHY
*listens to Gangnam Style in 2015* who am I
sometimes I take ages to draw one little sketch and it looks awful but then I scribble something in one minute and it looks ok??? alright
I'm almost done with Silver's side of the drawing but I haven't drawn anything for Blaze yet and I'm crying for real
@posilutelysoa ILY BAE
@spicygaysammi THATS WHAT HE IS but also a nerd
also yes the freckles are still missing on that picture but shhhhhh
I can never decide on an expression I hate this
in 500 years I might actually be done with that ref sheet of the Silver and Blaze redesign..... MAYBE
@JMoneyMC wHATAT IT SHIIS

@420milesprower I WILL AND I WILL ALSO RUB-- no I can't do this I need to stop
@transtrendering uuuhhhh way too long and IT LOOKS LIKE ASS. the new one looks better but I did that in like 30 minutes or less rip
I love how on twitter I can just talk to someone about me tattooing pictures of Silver all over me and then doin the do with him
@420milesprower AAAAAA STOP THAT'S TOO ADORABLE I'M CRYING
tfw you're too tired to eat
@420milesprower he's a fuckin idiot he'd probably like "WOW AM I REALLY THAT COOL" (no you're not)
@420milesprower IF ONLY.................... sighs
@MothTolias thanks ;; I really dont like the old one tho haha
@420milesprower also I thought you were gonna say "imagine it's your first time with Silver" that's how low I've sunk
@420milesprower if that didnt make them even more excited then whats even the point
@420milesprower yes or even better: tattooing them all over me
that might not be the best example to compare though
almost one year difference lmao the old one is so bad 
@KawaiiBee thanks 8) I love drawing hair hehe
@BomberInBlue that's what it is honestly haha orz
@andythecookies it made my day too omfg
@KawaiiBee thank you &lt;3
some doodle of Maria hmmm 
how do I stop being pissed off all the time
like you compare their old drawings to the new ones and think "I didn't think it was possible but YOU DID GET EVEN BETTER WTF THE FUCK"
do you know that feeling when you look at an artist and think "wow they can't get any better can they" but then they do and you cry
@miguelisasir STOP
I think I listened to that "you mean the chaos emeralds?" post too much and that's why I had a dream about Obama
I also dream about Silver pretty much every night but most of the time I forget what it was about
I DON'T UNDERSTAND MY DREAMS AT ALL
I really have no fuckin idea how anyone can dream shit like that I mean it was so fucked up I just??????
and Obama ended up dancing with some dude while wearing high-heels and I laughed my ass off it was fuckin wild
I forgot to mention, I had a dream about Barack and Michelle Obama inviting me to their house for dinner what the fuck
why do I even try 
@angry_dolphins I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA GET BETTER SOON OMG....
@angry_dolphins AAAAA ARE YOU ALRIGHT.......
everyone: busy with school, jobs, etc
me: talkin about Silver 24/7 and drawing useless shit
@420milesprower IT IS. in german it's like pretty much the same thing hmm
@420milesprower but IT IS INDEED CONFUSING WTF
@420milesprower tbh I just never thought about it before or even tried to understand omg
@JinriTwinTailed YEAH I'm the boss in town 8) but thank you for following me lmao I'm always glad to meet new Silver fans
why this 
@cynnaccino YEAH I'm cool with people laughing about it ofc heh. I just thought there was a joke I didn't get or anything :'o
i've been using it wrong the whole time
also I finally understood the difference between "lie down" and "lay down" after googling it I AM A FOOL
I wanna draw but also I kinda just wanna l lie down and watch conan lmao
I really feel like I'm slowly becoming a bitter pissbaby tho I don't like this at all
I don't understand how the "hi welcome to chili's" vine is funny I'm really sorry have I lost all my humor or what
damn i'm tired af but I wanna stay up all day and draw but hghghnggh I'm weak
I really wonder if anyone loves Silver more than I do because I don't think that's actually possible
OK I'M DONE......
おいでよシルバー♀たんの沼とかないの？沼すらない？ 
THIS @ IS NOT JUST FOR SHOW AFTER ALL
@mitsuki830 "Free-san" that's so cute omg..... and yes, how can you not love Silver ;;
to say that I'm obsessed with Silver is honestly an understatement
キャラじゃなくてCPですけども
大体1年前にかいたのをリメイク 
きっとご両親に怒られるどころの話じゃ無いですね…
(無断でかいてすいません) 
@mitsuki830 IS THIS ABOUT ME LMAO
good tho. very good.
I can't believe 449 people follow me on here 'cause all I do is talk about Silver
@ everyone who draws fanart of Silver: thank you and I love you
ughgfhgghhg Silver is way too pretty for me I'm gonna have to slay somebody
@mitsuki830 thank you!! &lt;3
SILVAMY SILVAMY SILVAMY SILVAMY SILVAMY..................
sorry for RT spam but holy fuck I'm dying
@420milesprower I'M LITERALLY DYING OVER HERE FUCK U
@mitsuki830 oh sorry, "btw" means "by the way" heh
@mitsuki830 also I LOVE YOUR ART YES
S-SILVER IN THAT SUIT IS MY KRYPTONITE SOMEONE SAVE ME
@mitsuki830 oh your english is very good btw hehe x)
NO MATTER WHAT GENDER SILVER IS I ALWAYS HAVE THE HOTS FOR HIM
*ships literally everyone with Silver* this is fine
@mitsuki830 I'm online all the time pretty much cause I have no life LMAO. it's about 1 pm here tho 8)
hhhhhhhhhh that first Sonilver pic I'm gonna faint
I don't care about anything but Silver anymore rip me
@posilutelysoa I UNDERSTAND I'm just the same lmao *looks at pile of unfinished games and cries*
where do I even start with all the shit I have to do
@posilutelysoa maybe you can like convince him to get steam and gift some games to him omg
@posilutelysoa TRUE and that's adorable omg I can't even figure out how it works anymore
@posilutelysoa I think I used to play it or a similar game at least, I really loved it back then omfg but now it's just.... ew
I COULDN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO I FEEL LIKE A FOOL BUT IDGAF I dont have the patience for this
IT'S FROM 1993 IT LOOKS SO FUCKIN BAD I'M CRYING
I got SimCity2000 the other day cause i bought a humble bundle and omfg this game........ I just tried it out and I'm dying
I'm gonna DM that "rtyourcrush" account when they followed me back and have them make a tweet for Silver
I LAUGHED MY ASS OFF WHEN I FOUND THAT GIF........
breakdancing eggman. really important 
I'm so fuckin bored even though I have like 3000 drawings to do
@Electro_Husky OH NO IBLIS GOT ME
HE IS INDEED PRECIOUS
well they are not wrong 
but it's not obvious on that drawing so it's alright
I really hate drawings of fictional characters smoking I really do
the only thing I don't like about that is that he#s smoking but I'm just gonna try to ignore that
HIPSTER SILVER
I'm very pleased by this drawing 
I love Amy
*drawings gdi I cant even type
I honestly have dozens of new ideas for drawing of Silver every day
i know I mentioned it like 50 times before but idgaf it's VERY IMPORTANT
for real tho he's so gay I can't take it like I just can't get over the fact that his heels are 5cm big I JUST CANT ALRIGHT
I mean he already wears heels kinda but not really since they're pretty flat and IDK HOW TO DESCRIBE IT OK
I wanna draw Silver in heels
I JUST HAD TO RT THOSE
not like I need to breathe or anything. or wanna draw
it honestly feels like there's a knife stuck in my back lol alright
that was another comment I got my god smh @ deviantart
"I only like the art but not the couple" do I care
also i'm laughing at "lier"
THAT DOESNT EVEN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DRAWING
why do people always feel the need to RP on my art 
I can't even bend down one time without my back being like "well I guess I'll go fuck myself then" for the rest of the day
Silver is all I need in my life to be happy
SO MUCH SILVER I MIGHT HAVE A HEARTATTACK
I'm so fuckin stressed out, good night orz
sometimes I honestly can't stand neurotypical people I'm sorry ughghgh
probably makes me sound like a fuckin pissbaby but that's what I am I guess
I'm so jealous of people who get to live a normal life without constantly being in pain and having mental illnesses etc etc etc
@Bassinite THANK U HEH
*suddenly has five billion ideas for drawings but my back hurts way too much to draw rn* this is fine
my icon makes it look like Silver said that and I am more than happy with this
BLAZE IS MY FUCKIN WIFE SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT AND STRONG AND OH MY GOD WHAT A QUEEN
OOOOO NOOOOO I JUST DIED OF CUTENESS WHY 
ah yes I love this back pain I love it so much also I wanna kill a man rn
I could also draw Maria again I haven't done that in a while and I LOVE HER SO MUCH
@SA2OAP ah thank you very much!!! &lt;3
so GIJINKAS IT'LL BE I GUESS
I really wanna draw more humans again but I'm not interested in drawing anything that's not Sonic-related atm lmao orz
@acierrtw THANK YOU A LOT TOO OMG I FEEL HONOURD HEHE
@acierrtw YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE I GUESS 8)) I love your Sonic style art so much too though... really I ADORE UR ART &lt;3
@acierrtw YOUR ART IS SO GOOD WTF????? I didn't know you could draw humans so well too I'M REALLY IMPRESSED and your colouring omfg
MY MOM IS GONE ALL DAY TODAY AND TOMORROW I'M SO GLAD AND RELIEVED
@posilutelysoa INDEED
@maddzee I LIKE RIGHT MORE
I was sad but seeing this MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD 
I wanna keep drawing but I can barely breathe because my chest is so tight so I'm gonna go lay down SEE YOU LATER
I need to draw more Roupaz hhhhhhhhhhhhh it's basically canon
@ LRT me too
I really need to go lay down tho drawing hurts me so much physically I hate this ;;;;;;
I just typed "spmoc" instead of sonic I need to lay down
@Electro_Husky TRU
and by that I mean it hurt my soul
also Silver without chest fur is literally killing me DRAWING THAT WAS SO HARD
I have like absolutely no patience whatsoever im sorry for posting so many wips but I'm just so hghsgghghh idk
I wanna draw but I dont wanna be on the computer since sitting here hurts BUT I HAVE TO SIT HERE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW AND I JUST
I just wanna lay down forever lol ok
*draws Silver without chest fur* I don't know who I am anymore
I ship Silver with my fc Cherry please slay me
"Silver the Bellydancer" I'm hooked already
knowing how to draw Sonic character's heads from different angles is like an art all in itself honestly
@HaloMillennium I know that feeling lol it's the same for me with Photoshop :///
it turned into this 
@craciaci thank you aaa ;o;
but I can't do lineart and sketches very well with that program it's kinda difficult idk BUT COLOURING WITH IT IS PERFECT
that's one of the reasons why I love manga studio so much, you can make the brushes really huge heh
I hate how in SAI the brushes aren't big enough sometimes if you're canvas is too big guhghhgu
OH I just noticed I forgot to redraw that other circle on Silver's foot
I hate how Silver is such a bae
@tfwlelouch *CRIES IN THE CORNER*
I'm so sad that new Silent Hil game (probably) got cancelled :///// KILL ME
tfw you erase on a layer with preserved opacity and notice too late :,)
@EduConnectionz TRU LMAO I mean not everyone on there is a douche, I like a lot of people on that site :o
time to sin-- I mean draw
@sonknux his talent is YAOI HANDS TO THE MAX

I'M GLAD YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH I LOVE FRECKLES
@mashumaroboi we agreed on something now but I'm still kinda salty about it lmao orz
I'd just say fuck u and pick a new winner but I don't wanna start shit or cause drama lmao
I dont think they even know how rude they are being and how lucky they should be that I'm still being nice to them
people on dA are such pissbabies why this
I'm slowly gettin real irritated here what is this
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
nOW THE PERSON IS ASKING ME TO DRAW SOMETHING FOR HERSELF *AND* HER GIRLFRIEND??????? UMM
oh my fucking god
THAT'D BE SO FUCKING HELLA I'M CRYING JUST IMAGINING IT
but to talk about that concert pic again...... THE ONLY THING I CAN READ IS NIGHTS INTO DREAMS SO??? I'M GUESSING IT'S SEGA MUSIC IN GENERAL
@miguelisasir I HAVENT SEEN IT YET BUT I SHOULD
@miguelisasir I'M ON BOARD WITH THIS
@HunterTSF I SHOULD PROBABLY BUT I WANNA TRY TO BE NICE ABOUT THIS UGH
I could draw something for her or whatever. idk I'M STILL BEING REALLY NICE HERE
ok I sent them a note and said "yo that's not very nice to ask" basically, but also said that if they wanna get smth for their girlfriend
@miguelisasir AAAAAAA IT'S SO COOL ISN'T IT I WISH I COULD GO
@420milesprower oh same
@HunterTSF OH YEAH on its own this tweet looks like I considered giving them the points lol, sorry it was continuing from the last tweet
@HunterTSF I didn't want to give them any points anyways ugh :/// and I think they wanna like get a premium membership with them but yeah no
I would kill a man to be able to go to this concert also loOK HOW CUTE SONIC IS 
@sonknux LMAO YEAH I'm definitely not gonna be nice about it...... some people I swear //smh
@mashumaroboi YEAH FOR REAL
@13aymax ugh THAT SUCKS I'M SORRY x(
@espectalll123 idk what kinda word that is but YEAH HELLO
@mashumaroboi they said "I don't know if I want art of my character or points, since I kind of want to get something for me and my gf" wtf
so asking for points is extremely rude to be honest wtf the fuck
like what the fuck the giveaway clearly said you could win some of my art as a thanks for supportng me aka watching me since I reached 1k
I could just send them points instead of drawing something for them :,,,)
I'm kinda pissed rn tbh 'cause I was just on dA and the person who wn the first place in my art giveaway asked me if
hello friendos
@13aymax oh no :o what's wrong with them?
@420milesprower I can definitely confirm that YES
@420milesprower I know I MEAN HE'S MY BOYFRIEND AFTER ALL
@420milesprower he looks like boyfriend material
so... GOOD NIGHT EVERYONE
I've been up since like 18 hours and I wanted to stay up till tonight but you know what I can't fuckin do this
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL LIKE WHEN I FIRST SAW IT I COULDN'T EVEN COMPREHEND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IT WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL
I will never be able to get over this panel LOOK AT HIS FACE IT'S PERFECT 
@Electro_Husky NO IT'S ALRIGHT IF YOU DO I just mean I don't omg. I've never drawn that before and it'd look horrible probably lol
@Electro_Husky I DONT HAVE A PAW FETISH SORRY LOL

@SilverHeckr I'M SO SORRY BAE I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON...........
WHY DOES THAT PAUL BLART MEME MAKE ME LAUGH SO MUCH THIS ONE IS THE FUCKING BEST
Life goes on with or without you
I swim in the sea of the unconscious, 
@Zeromaru2 YEAH I actually changed it so it looks like a burn or something now
LRT rip me just fucking rip me
@HaloMillennium AGREED
Silver is my problematic fave tbh
@mizkepler WELL NOT ON THIS PIC BUT ASIDE FROM THAT I AGREE YES
a bruised and bloody Silver in a dress would indeed be heaven :,)
@miguelisasir THAT DRAWING IS SO CUTE WHERE IS IT FROM
@mizkepler I KNOW don't worry 8))))
@fleetwaysonikku thank you &lt;3
the fact that Silver has a bruise on his quill makes no sense whatsoever but I like how it looks ok
I hope that drawing will turn out alright cause rn it looks like ass
@CometShrine &gt;&gt;&gt;B))))))))
well at least I get to draw Silver bleeding and bruised &gt;8)))
I hate drawing detailed pictures so much I suck at it so bad
I have like this constant frown on my face but as soon as I see Silver it's always gone
@sonicova thank you bae ;;
I wish my sketches weren't so messy and gross wtf
@Shibiron thank u aaaaaaaaaaa
I'm in so much pain right now :)
@HaloMillennium THAT'S HILARIOUS OMG I could see Silver doing this too
@oldmanshadow thanks ;o;!!!
@SpeedHighway THANK U &lt;3
you can still RT it tho I appreciate it thank u
that's not done yet btw lmao
I FUCKING SUCK AT THIS PLEASE BURY ME
the Silver redesign I'm drawing now is basically just "he can't afford clothes bc he's a hobo and also bc I'm a useless pervert"
it's difficult to redesign male Sonic character's clothes since they barely wear any
I dont wanna draw this anymore fuck it I'm so fuckin done
I feel really numb and shitty again lol ok why
I want to think of a new quill style for Silver or at least change it a bit or add something but the one he has is already perfection?? damn
now it's time to draw the bae

@HaloMillennium I KNOW THAT SHIRT AND I NEED IT SO BAD
@Electro_Husky SORRY it's only for people on dA btw

@japhetgrindr no it's two heads haha, it's supposed to be like a ref sheet for redesigns of Silver and Blaze I'm trying to do
@KawaiiBee I know right? I've been so productive today, i'm proud of myself.....
have I ever mentioned that Silver is my boyfriend? I might have implied it once

@spicygaysammi MY PLEASURE
@spicygaysammi YO 
@veecopter I KNOW RIGHT this takes the mono-eye to a whole new level
like the concept for the page and the effects and everything are great but silver's face looks so weird omg I can't take it seriously
I've honestly always wanted to try redrawing this page but that'd be A LOT of work omg 
@TheBlueComet1 I have no clue either lol orz
@budjeto I'M LAUGHIGNGHH he looks dead inside
@HaloMillennium same honestly but with furry porn probably
new art meme: take any page from the old Archie Sonic comics and redraw it, change as much as you like JUST MAKE IT GOOD
@budjeto ME TOO OMFG BUT HIS EYES ARE THE WORST
ah yes..... such emotion, I might start crying 
he's trash but he's also my boyfriend y'know, he's honestly a jerk but then again not???? idk how to describe it
I'm a Silver apologist
please look at my pinned tweet it's really important
well I can confirm that at least one of these things is true 
since it's locked and stuff y'know lmao oh well FUCK IT
maybe I should stop eating candy and drinking coke after I can't go to the bathroom anymore to brush my teeth before going to bed OOPS

@HunterTSF I'M PROUD OF MYSELF
@HunterTSF I'M TOO HOT, HOT DAMN
my kind of collection 
I'm finally on the computer and I just 
taking a good selfie is like playing The Impossible Game. it's difficult as hell, no fun, and you end up with fifty thousand failed attempts
trying to look nice is already difficult but taking a good selfie is damn near impossible
I tried to take a selfie cause I thought I looked nice in the mirror but omfg I hate cameras THANKS FOR RUINING EVERYTHING
I would take a selfie but nah lmao
or because I look gross who knows tbh
maybe that dude was starin at me cause my hair looks nice I dyed it red today hell ye
don't you just love it when people on the train stare at you :')
pretty much no joke is funny if you have to explain it first
I hate posts on tumblr where someone explains why something is funny like, that always ruins the joke for me???
@transtrendering I wanna try drawing a pic of it but YEAH.... TRY
@Electro_Husky **is lmao
@Electro_Husky yEAH my name on there freedomfightersonic
I LOVE MY DREAMS SO FUCKIN MUCH I just woke up like five minutes ago but I just had to share this
oh and he had his quills in a ponytail it was too cute to be true I'm so done rn
ALSO when you finished that level in a certain time or something you unlocked him to be playable aaaaaa
it was like his cameo in a Sonic Generations level that looked like Venice which is hilarious considering that used to be Silver's name omfg
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT SILVER BEING A GONDOLIER I'M GOING TO FUCKING SCREAM THAT WAS SO CUTE????? BYE
alright good night friends, I hope I dream about Silver being gay again aka regular Silver
@angry_dolphins HE CANNOT ESCAPE
@spicygaysammi oh right I almost forgot. damn me
actually nevermind that question. Silver isn't single 'cause he's my boyfriend, whether he likes it or not
I wish I knew why Silver is so goddamn beautiful ugh I hate him
is Silver single? I'm asking for a friend
@takoyakiboi I'M PROUD OF YOU SON
I ship some really fucked up shit I should be ashamed of myself but YOLO
@takoyakiboi me too
WHY ALWAYS WHEN I'M TIRED OR NOT EVEN AT HOME. OR BOTH
I just had a really good idea for a drawing gdi

I wanna reply to stuff but my eyes are burning so much rn I'm so tired
sorry for replying so slow or not at all rn but I'm on mobile and my internet is slow af OTL also I should sleep
@posilutelysoa she got so mad in the first place and blamed everything on me orz so I cant even tell him, it would make things worse sadly
@posilutelysoa actually, me telling my dad about her locking the kitchen a while ago made my dad freak out and insult her and that's why
I always feel so spoiled when I'm at my dad's place haha it's a nice change from home
guess who's gonna take a nap now lmao
MY GAY LEVELS HAVE RISEN QUITE A LOT RECENTLY
I keep checking out every second girl I see like wtf I remember being gay but not THIS gay
@ LRT I'M CRYING I CAN'T STOP LAUGHIN AND I'M IN PUBLIC BYE
@13aymax fuCKIN FAVE WHERE CAN I HIRE HIM
I need to learn how to fuckin chill
I'm trying really hard not to laugh out loud, these people must think I'm a fuckin idiot but oh well
I'm on the train and I can't stop smiling cause I keep thinking about "you mean the chaos emeralds?" SOMEONE SAVE ME
I seriously weep over how much I love Silver and Blaze I love them so so so so so so so sO SO GODDAMN MUCH!!!!!!!!!!! HELP ME
most of the time I really can't stand leaving the house, I'm always in my own little world so when I go out I feel like I'm dying
alright I have to leave now but I will be on mobile
I honestly can't get over how much I love Silver like it just astounds me every day
I'm in so much pain I don't wanna leave the house hhhhhhhhh
@Electro_Husky nah it's alright that's like a daily thing and normally much worse //laughs
THANK U THO
I'm too tired to do anything rn send help
@Electro_Husky yeah I'm fine omg why are you asking
me too 
idk I just felt like telling you guys about that rip
I GOT OTHER SHIT TO DEAL WITH I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS TALK OR RELATIONSHIPS IN GENERAL GTFO
like how about you don't worry about that kinda stuff since I don't give one single fuck about it anyways
I said "well I never had a girlfriend either did I" lmao
SHE'S SO FUCKIN STUPID and then she said "well it's unusual that you never had a boyfriend!!!" and I just
***not normal gdi
"it's not the norm that's what I mean!!!" and I was just standing there laughing and shaking my head bye
and then she said "well I just want to know but you don't have to be embarassed about it, even if it's nor... normal or.... well"
sHE ASKED ME IF I LIKE GIRLS OR WHATEVER AND WAS DOING LIKE SOME DUMB SPEECH SHE PREPARED I'M YELLING
and I knew everyone can see it but I didn't really give a fuck but then earlier my mom confronted me about it ofmgfgf
I'm laughing cause my status on whatsapp is "gay" since a. it's true and I'm hella gay and b. I love that word
I don't really know why I made that tweet but it had to be said
@RakugakiSquid OH YEAH I DID I ALREADY THANKED HUNTER OMFG
maybe I can take a nap at my dad's place when I get back from the appointment lmao rip
@RakugakiSquid THAN YOU BAE I WILL TRY
I say "this is fine" way too often ESPECIALLY SINCE I DREW THAT PIC OF SILVER TBH
I'm half asleep and I have an appointment in two hours this is fuckin fine
*hasn't slept in 12+ hours and is getting delusional*
suddenly I am motivated to draw
@HunterTSF depending on the time yes but depending on the food no
@HunterTSF it is a mystery
also yes it's 8 am and I just ate dinner it was noice
I ALWAYS GET SO SLEEPY AFTER EATING DINNER UGH HELP ME
I have an appointment and then I'm going to my dad's place and holy fuck I am so ready to fall asleep rn
I have to be awake for another?? idk over 12 hours definitely and I've already been awake since like 12
I hope you guys read that in the "what the FUCK is a Sonic"-voice
*draws* what the FUCK is a lightsource
@veecopter it's difficult to write ideas for designs down ;o; like what I want their clothes to look like and stuff aaaaa
not just fanart though, also music videos and voice acting and music in general and fanfiction etc etc etc
it's kinda sad how sometimes the fans put more effort and thought and love into creating fanart than the creators put into the franchise
i love redesigns so much like often they're better than the original lmao especially if it's of Sonic Boom or just unpopular characters
basically I wanna draw redesigns of Silver and Blaze really fuckin bad and I have some nice ideas and aaaaaaa I DONT WANNA FORGET THEM
I also have some other shit to do besides getting ready before I leave so I can't use that time to draw either ghhgfgh
*has really good idea for a drawing like one hour before I have to get ready and leave* THIS IS FINE
shit I laughed myself awake again
"you mean the chaos emeralds?" WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS CRACK ME UP SO MUCH
ok but before I go please listen to this 
time to lay down or I will truly die GOODBYE
what the fuck is this pain is there a knife stuck in my back or what
@japhetgrindr I'M JUST INSANE AND A MASOCHIST HONESTLY
I actually have some money from commissions now wtf is this feeling???? it feels so????? unfamiliar????? lmao
BUT I ALREADY DREW SOMETHING LIKE THAT ONCE even tho I never finished it but yeah
ALSO THAT SHOULD HONESTLY BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND LIKE BLAZE SHOULD BE HOLDING A WOUNDED SILVER LMAOO
I really need to stop doing everything on one layer it fuckin kills me
I cant even draw shit to relieve my stress it just looks like ass THIS IS FINE
my art is so fuckin messy when I draw when I'm mad lmao
I wanna draw something violent to feel better but idk what
I didnt know you can have GIFs as icons on here wtf the fuck
jesus I'm too hungry to concentrate on anything but I wanna draw
@mizkepler **lean lol. also it hurts my back and YEAH IDK I'M BEING A PISSBABY
@mizkepler I would do that too but my desk is pretty small and I have to learn over my tablet everytime if I wanna use my keyboard lmao orz
@mizkepler also I checked and it's i, but then it's stuck on the color picker tool again and ghfuhfhhg WHY THIS
@Electro_Husky NOOOOOOOOO
@mizkepler thanks for telling me, I just really hate having to use my keyboard when I'm drawing ugh orz
I really wish I was mentally stable enough to draw on a regular basis lmao I'm pushing myself SO MUCH to even draw as much as I do now
like really I DONT THINK IT REQUIRES A LOT OF EFFORT TO PROGRAM THAT IN IF EVEN SAI HAS THAT OPTION
photoshop: I'm the best and most expensive art program on the entire planet! also you can't use right-click to pick colors sorry
right-clicking does absolutely nothing and using the color picker tool everytime takes 500 years and my god I hate PS
ok but is there a quick way to pick a color in Photoshop? like in SAI or Manga Studio where you just right-click? 'cause apparently not
@Electro_Husky JESUS
I'm actually stuck on the third one because of some minigame that pisses me off LMAO GODDAMNIT
like ok some minigames are a bit annoying, especially in the third one, but it's still fuckin good af
my fave is Sly Cooper 2 it's so fuckin good I can't think of anything I dislike about that game
especially after the first one, I didnt like the first one THAT much but the others are perfect
the music the characters the levels the gameplay FUCKIN EVERYTHING IT'S SO GOOD!!!!!!!! DAMN
Sly Cooper is so good slay me
@13aymax ari²
@love_nekos AH NICE yeah I memed too hard that day
glorious
bad things
whenever I post art to my nsfw account I feel like "IF I'M GOING TO HELL THEN I'M GONNA DRAG YOU ALL DOWN WITH ME"
@Electro_Husky YOU FUCKIN KNOW IT MAN
@13aymax THANK U I'm glad hehe
@love_nekos ;o; that's so cute omg &lt;3 which one is it??
@maddzee always keep on fusing them together YKNOW
@maddzee THANK YOU OMG it's not bad to do that tho &lt;3 and I do use multiply or overlay layers over the colouring layer but like
@Shibiron //ADDS IT TO THE LIST
Nash more like TRASH amirite?? JK OMG I love him &lt;3 for @13aymax !! 
WHYYY DO I HAAATE EVERYTHING I DRAW
ALL I CAN DO IS DRAW MEMES
I should draw this with Silver and Blaze honestly 
@xRagnell fghdasgg THANK YOU WTF ;v;
@japhetgrindr YEAH I'm kinda trying to do that mhhh
**laziest omfg
it'd be so much more useful to make several layers but I just really hate doing that I HATE IT
I'm honestly the alziest artist on this planet I put no effort into anything and colour everything on one layer cause I'm trash
I think he's from a game or something isnt he??? IDK MAN OK
I havent seen the new Sonic Boom episode yet but that computer guy looks really cute wtf
yes hello I hate putting down the base colors
@MothTolias LMAO NO I WISh he's too perfect for me
I don't even care anymore if my lineart is clean or not, fuck it
it's been like half a year since you drew that for me and I'm still crying over it
*thinks about that supercute pic of Silver and Free that Chilli did for me* JUST FUCK ME UP WOW
for real like the best thing you could ever draw for me is Silver and my sonicsona together like I know I'm trash but GODDGGDH
*casually ships myself with Silver too* oops
especially everything with Silver in it cause goddamn I ship Silver with fuckin EVERYONE
I'M SO HORRIBLE LIKE I REALLY LOVE OFFICIAL/FC PAIRINGS WHEN THEY'RE DONE WELL MY GOD I'M TRASH
@EduConnectionz THANK YOU BAE I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING A NICE DAY TOO OMG ILY
@maddzee ;A; THANK YOU
@SarcasmBKD I'M GLAD thank u omg
@RakugakiSquid @Electro_Husky THANK U THAT'D BE NEATO
everytime I draw something wrong and dont know how to fix it I just wanna cry I hate this I'm such a fuckin baby
I FUCKING HATE DRAWING ARMS
and Silver of course but that's a given
THE END
the only noticeable things about my art that I can tell I have are: weird little dots on some places, CHEST FLUFF, soft, bright colours
BUT I LOVE DOING THAT
like all that I notice myself is that I make these little dots everywhere on the lineart and colouring too sometimes idk how to describe it
I honestly have no clue if I have anything noticeable about my art style at all??? wtf
@xLuminii yeah maybe, I should check :o thank you
oh well fuck it I guess lmao
my settings are in English though like WHAT IS THIS
like instead of "tagged" it says "getaggt" and instead of "notes" it says "anmerkungen" and stuff like that what the hell
wait why the heck is my art blog in German I didn't even notice omfggfg
I hope they dont confront me about it too I hate that orz
now I feel like a prick but gghnghghh
it was kind of an accident that I watched them aaaaaaa I didn't mean to orz
I unwatched that person too everyone is talkin about I'm v sorry but they seem like a lot of trouble haha,,,,,,,,
HUNTER PLEDGED 50 DOLLAR TO ME ON PATREON WHAT THE FUCK DUDE THANK YOU SO MUCH...........
my mouse only works whenever the fuck it wants like???? jesus christ I have to use my tablet all the time
@Electro_Husky HE'S GAY TRASH
@Electro_Husky he'S A FUCKIN LOSER
@KawaiiBee IT'S ALRIGHT THANKS, I WISH YOU SWEATY DREAMS TOO
alright I need to lay down GOOD NIGHT
I hate Silver so much
but I don't want it to be a comic about shipping lmao idk. I would have 500 ideas otherwise
maybe I should ask someone to write the story for me or something orz like when I read fanfiction I always imagine it as a comic in my head
@oldmanshadow to discover how gay he is
@ LRT just fuck me up
or well he has to be the main character of it HE DESERVES IT
tbh I really wanna start drawing a comic but I have absolutely no clue what the story should be?? OTL all I know is Silver needs to be in it
it's so difficult to come up with different angles and poses and whatever rip me
I need to stop drawing characters facing the left from a 3/4 view omfg bye
I should make a fan group for Silver on dA tbh I mean he's the bae
@13aymax THANKS DEAR I'M GLAD x)
I honestly like it when people pair their fcs with official characters as long as it's done well
that does look gay af though I'm hooked
WHAT IS IT WITH THE PERFECT SONGS ALWAYS PLAYING AT THE RIGHT MOMENTS
I just saw a comic where Silver is taking a shower and i'M FUCKIN HOOKED ALREADY HOLY FUCK
honestly all that a drawing needs to make me interested is have Silver on it
@SilverHeckr THANK U
whenever I try drawing a character looking cool or whatever they just end up grinning like a predator or pervert or something lmao
S&amp;M by Rihanna started playing while I was drawing this and it really didnt help the fact that this looks kinda weird 
I hate cluttered dA profiles so much I just like it simple
how does drawing even work
@RakugakiSquid you're doing fine bae I have commissions to do that have been due since several months LOL RIP
*is happy with something I drew* nice
*looks at it five minutes later* wait nevermind
@TheBlueComet1 
@SarcasmBKD THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT HAPPENED THO tbh it happens a lot orz
@EduConnectionz @fleetwaysonikku thank you cuties ;o;
@dlaryofjane I AGREE and yes she's a terrible person
I love manga studio so much, since I'm using it to color my art looks so much better imo??? it looks more painter-y idk
@Electro_Husky me too man ME TOO
@maddzee SAME.........
@SarcasmBKD it's okay to laugh honestly I LAUGHED AT MYSELF
@TheBlueComet1 YE
*tries to draw with the blur tool* WHY IS NOTHING HAPPENING
whenever I sneeze my mom says "bless you" in a really annoyed and irritated voice and I just?? sorry that I sneezed???? lmao
can someone please kill me 'cause I honestly can't take Silver's cuteness anymore
I'm like half asleep rn but I have to finish this drawing rip
OOOOO NIMROD U TOO THANK U.........
I'm tired af but I have to draw and aaaaaaaaaaaa
@SilverHeckr TBH I SHOULD LIKE REDRAW IT FOR YOU AND COLOUR IT OR SOMETHING IF YOU WANT OMG it's so old
looking at my old art hurts my soul deeply
@sonknux NO IT'S VERY APPRECIATED THANK YOU
@pendrakeon I'm adding this to the list of things I never knew I needed to see to complete my life experience
A THANK YOU TO KELLY FOR BEING MY FIRST PATRON ILY @sonknux 
OOOOOOOOO KELLY THANK YOU SO MUCH OMFG ILY........... @sonknux
I still dont know how the payment thing on patreon works lol this is fine
I decided to keep it up like I thought about it and idk if people would even be interested but I really need the moneys lmao
I FINALLY SET UP A PATREON BTW 
@CometShrine I WAS UHH.... busy
@WindRiderx67 so you drew it?
@WindRiderx67 well a source would be nice tho lol
@CometShrine MOMENT RUINED
@takoyakiboi ILY TOO
@WindRiderx67 idk what that has to do with it but me too yes
it's not even really a great computer like it's outdated and shit but that doesn't matter
I have so many consoles and games and expensive art stuff etc but my computer is like my most important and valuable posession tbh
if only they knew omfg you could bribe me into doing literally anything if you were in posession of my external drive (or my pc in general)
as always lmao I mean WHEN DOES SHE EVER
it's really unsafe to let it just stand around in my room but?? my mom thinks I don't have anything to hide anyways. she doesnt have a clue
also my nsfw drawings, that too lmao rip
my diary (I write it in word) and all the gay fanart I save and also *whispers* porn
I'm so paranoid but that would honestly be the end of the world to me since not only all my drawings are on there but also
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT MY MOM OR MY STEPDAD HAD LIKE TOOK IT WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE TO COPY MY FILES FROM IT LMAO
I restarted the computer and then it worked again jesus i'm so relieved
I got a mini-heartattack earlier 'cause my external drive wasn't working properly and when I clicked on it it said it was empty???
KISSES MY COMPUTER I MISSED YOU SO MUCH BAE those two days sure were long
also hello i'm finally back home and on the computer and I'm dying
41 notifications jfc
home is where the wi-fi is
I'm finally home and I can't wait to get on the computer but I have to shower first hhhhhh
@fucktionkin THANK YOU you too &lt;3

@SilverHeckr I TRY MY BEST
@takoyakiboi ^^^^^^^^^^^^ FUCKIN EXACTLY OMG TY
@HS_squire_absol thank you &lt;3 I hope you have a good day too! my day is going well so far x)
@Electro_Husky no it's alright omg I dont think anyone saw lol. Also if you wanna find the drawing, try using reverse image search on Google
@Electro_Husky DUDE I CLICKED ON THIS WHILE OTHER PEOPLE WERE IN THE ROOM AND COULD SEE I'M GOING TO FUCKIN CRY LMAO BYE
ME?? OBSESSED????? WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN ABOUT HAHA sweats
I also gave Silver a good morning kiss too this is absolutely necessary
I just got up btw it's about half past 8 AM and I'm dying I hate getting up early
person: hey I wanna show you this pic-
me: is Silver on it
person: no but--
me: I DON'T CARE THEN
or how low I've sunk. I can't tell
that really just happened. this is how far I've come
*looks at beautiful drawing of Silver on my phone* *actually kisses screen* good night bae
I'm at my dad's place now by the way I'm staying the night too
that was embarrassing af to be honest
But two people warned me fortunately lmao Idk I just can't think clearly anymore
I just almost got hit by a train cause I wasn't paying attention lol this is fine
I'm so gay and embarassing
@RakugakiSquid TAILS
tumblr is such a well-functioning and flawless website, I must say
APOTOSSSSSS
oh jesus this headache I'm having rn is really just????? fuckin me up
@transtrendering same
@SilverHeckr me too though I'm pretty sure I never even had one to begin wtih
@transtrendering yeah I feel you omg orz
@SilverHeckr UUUUUUUH..... PRACTICE AND ALSO SELLING UR SOUL IDK
@SilverHeckr DON'T LOOK AT ME HOW WOULD I KNOW
nothing makes me happier than good fanart of Silver tbh
@SilverHeckr IKR
@Electro_Husky YO I'm here if you wanna talk hehe
I will never get over Maria's death I just can't
@Prowertastic oh no red pandas..... my weakness.............
@KawaiiBee I CANT EVEN DO ONE BUT OKAY I WILL TRY
SOMEONE MOTIVATE ME PLS I'M DYING
@Hooru01 DON'T BE SO CUTE WITH ME I already can't handle Silver's cuteness ok
@Hooru01 SLAMS FISTS ON TABLE NOW THAT'S THE KINDA SHIT I LIKE TO SEE
@RakugakiSquid HE THE BAE good luck with it omg
@RakugakiSquid YOU KNOW WHO
@Prowertastic OH YEAH. true heh
@fehck you should be careful, it's possible you could have diabetes or a different disease.... you should get it checked if you can ;;
@MothTolias my journal does say they're closed, but people never read it haha &lt;/3
@pendrakeon is that a titty
@Prowertastic I'm not sure what you mean but if you mean Silver by "boy toy" then it's perfectly accurate yes
at least I'm getting a lot faster with this like I used to take 5 hours for one and now maybe 2
done with another commission hell yeah I'm ready to die
@pendrakeon look at her eyelashes clipping thru her hair
@KawaiiBee THANK UUUUUU
it says I raised enough to provide 10 people with clear water for a year that's so cool I'M SO GLAD
AAAAA THANKS TWO PEOPLE ALREADY DID IT........... when you install it by using that link it gives me hearts that I can donate so thank u
I've been using that app since a few months and I'm already at level 42 IT'S SO NICE TO KNOW YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH JUST OPENING TABS
guysss if you have Chrome, can you please install tabforacause?? it's really helpful to people in need! THANK U 
I WANNA LEARN IT SO BAD BUT I JUST HATE THE INTERFACE OF IT
but maybe that's just me idk I just hate photoshop I'M SORRY
and it's really quick to pick a new color, unlike in fucking photoshop where it takes five billion years and looks like ass
I also really love the color selection boxes and stuff, they're way better than the ones in SAI or Photoshop
all I need is the basic manga studio brushes I wanna marry them they're so good
I forget to breathe really often I'm just so tense all the time
that was such a tumblr person idea tbh even if that sounds like a shitty thing to say but eeh I hope you guys know what I mean
LESS WORK FOR ME
I once had an idea to like draw sonic characters representing certain sexualities but I really don't like that idea anymore so fuck it lmao
and by that I mean draw
time to sin
but I could use the money but hhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wanna make adopts but also no since I get way too attached to my characters
I love giving away free art cause I love making people happy but also I take ages to finish it and I'm sorry
I have like 50 new drawing ideas every day but I can't concentrate on them since I have so much gift art and commissions to finish??? rip
and then I wanna draw Silver falling on his ass like I did the other day
I wanna draw Silver and Blaze inline skating
@MothTolias I KNEW SOMEONE WOULD SAY IT
also same goes for spambots pls leave me alone
account doesnt cater to their interests AT ALL
and by hipster I mean people who only follow me so I follow them back and who have weird ass profiles where I can just tell that my
I swear if one more hipster follows me on here I'm going to nuke this site
@pendrakeon I didnt even see that till you pointed it out omfg bless u
so now I'm like yes I made the mistake of misunderstanding him too now I'm here to atone for my sins LMAO
the thing is actually I used to be one of those people who didn't get him right at all like looking at my old art of Silver makes me cringe
I WILL NEVER GIVE HIM UP I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT MY BAE HE NEEDS TO BE APPRECIATED FOREVER
I feel like my life mission is not only to make everyone love Silver but also to make people understand him better
SIGHS LOUDLY I WISH EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THAT
and not in the "oh no I never know what to do!!!! I'm such a helpless little baby!!!" sense
he's naive in that sense that he thinks a fight will solve everything
and I know I said it a million times already but he isn't even naive n the traditional sense lol
I think the most important character traits he has are how quick he is to jump to conclusions and also how aggressive he can be
I really don't think "naive" is Silver's main character trait, or even one of the most important ones tbh
@oldmanshadow lineart fuckin sucks honestly I think every artist hates it
WHEN I FIRST SAW IT I LITERALLY DIED
also can we talk about how fuckin cute Silver is in that scene like it hurts my soul
me 
doing the switcharoundmeme is fun but putting it together is hell
I hate Photoshop I fucking hate it so goddamn much
@sonknux @RakugakiSquid thank you so much &lt;3
@posilutelysoa SAME
@oldmanshadow I WISH I KNEW
never let this die 
I'm still laughing at this pic 
@sonknux THAT SUCKS......... I wish you good luck with it tho omg &lt;/3
@silverfuckr I actually liked how this turned out wtf
I wouldnt know cause I already finished school and it can go fuck itself. also it's different depending on where you live
could it be that everyone is busy with school lately or something?? barely anyone is ever online
I've only been on the computer for five minutes and I'm already bored af
it has Trevor aka my husband on the back I'M SO HAPPY
I'm wearing my GTA V jacket rn this is the life
alright I need to lay down I'm literally dead so goodbye
I CAN'T SOTP LAUGHIGNGH 
@RakugakiSquid @sonknux THANK YOU and yeah I bet omg
@japhetgrindr my secret is that I cry a lot and hate everything I draw
@japhetgrindr also thank you omg
@japhetgrindr ABSOLUTELY
@Electro_Husky SORRY but I'm so busy with like 500 drawings orz
@maddzee R I P  US
it's done... she looked kinda like she had been caught doing smth forbidden so I just?? YEAH @RakugakiSquid @sonknux 
finishing the drawing itself doesn't even take me that long, it just takes ages to even be motivated to work on it :,,,)
I finished that whole pic in about two hours I'm kinda proud omg also HELLA GLAD THAT I FINALLY FINISHED IT JESUS CHRIST
I'm almost done with this drawing I'm so happy I could cry
@Electro_Husky MAYBE ONE DAY
@Electro_Husky I SUCK AT DRAWING PAWS SORRY
@Electro_Husky same
@Electro_Husky that's what he is indeed 8)
I wanna play video games but I'm also ready to die
@Hooru01 AAAAAA THERE IT IS I MISSED IT.......... it looks so cute omfg  I love
the best drawing I did this whole year 
@MothTolias yeah I should lol. I think it has to do with my bones actually, they're like a bit.. dislocated? idk how else to describe it omg
@MothTolias JUST AS PLANNED. Sonic and Shadow are also on the pic lol
@RakugakiSquid OK I'M GLAD AND ALSO EXCITED TO SEE
@13aymax YES WE CAN I'm here friendo
@Hooru01 oooo which drawing
@13aymax cries with you
@Hooru01 TALK TO ME
@13aymax WHY IS IT ALWAYS EMPTY WHEN I'M THERE
also yes he has braces
LAUGHS AT SELF I JUST........... KNUCKLES YOU HAVE CHANGED
I found this in my old art folder too and I wish i finished it back then 
time to suffer uh I mean draw
@silverfuckr @RakugakiSquid important
Raku this is you  くコ:彡
@imsuffering it's so charming isn't it omg &lt;3
@imsuffering your art is so nice aaaaaaaaaaa
I like that style so much, people say it looks weird but I love love love it
is that KH in FF7 style because I cry................
I love how Nimrod faved that 'cause the hot furries I was talking about were from a post he reblogged
*sees hot guys on my dash* wow nice
*sees hot furries on my dash* REALLY NICE!!!!!!!!!!
the song "fuck you" by lilly allen is like my theme song
@MothTolias I used to have several thousand tabs open on firefox (I think 3k or something) but I finally deicded to close them all some day
@Hooru01 ME TOO and then it keeps on adding to more
@sonknux tbh I think yours and Huski's style is pretty similar in certain parts hehe I love that
@galaxysonics yeah i think so too!!! I love that omg I get inspired by my friend's art A LOT
like a certain group of people who are all friends and who all draw have certain things about their art styles that are similar hmmm
do you ever notice that artists who are friends with other artists often have similar styles as them, at least kind of?
@KawaiiBee it's alright heh &lt;3 thank you though. i'll figure it out somehow!
do you ever get these sudden bursts of affection for someone because I do
either way I just wanna say I LOVE YOU ALL
@KawaiiBee hmmm no it deletes only 3,200 ;v; there's other sites but they all have their disdvantages aaaaaa
@KawaiiBee I already used all kinds of sites to delete my tweets but it only works till a certain amount of them &lt;/3
@SilvurFangirl THAT'S ALRIGHT thank you though hehe
I aint even mad when other people repost my art on instagramm or something it just makes me laugh and also kinda embarassed
@SilvurFangirl oh jesus THAT'S EMBARASSING
@SilvurFangirl thanks for the suggestion though &gt;&lt;
@SilvurFangirl and YT is in general pretty shitty when it comes to paying others idk it's complicated but I don't like it lol
@SilvurFangirl I could do that on my speedpaint account but you really don't get a lot of money unless you get like several 100k views orz
@JJEmily_8 that's a good idea, thank you!!
@sonicova absolutely cause people love nothing more than free art lol
@silverfuckr ay look at this thing
@andythecookies I'M NOT CUTE..... i'm manly as hell
@andythecookies thanks!! &lt;3
@MothTolias sounds good!! thank u
I mean hey I started playing Sonic when I was 3 too and I WANT IT TO BE.... PASSED DOWN FOR GENERATIONS LMAO
I'm thinking about giving my sister my sega mega drive and my Sonic 1 game since I'm not using it atm cause I want my niece to play it
for real i'm a little kid myself SO.............
tho i'm not the motherly type or anything i'm more like that type who plays with the kids a lot since I'm like on their level LMAO
but I'm spending more time with my niece lately and she's so cute and it's just fun hanging out with her and my sister idk
I would still never ever in my life wanna be a mom jesus even just saying that freaks me the fuck out
kids are great tbh or maybe I'm just getting old that I'm thinking like that now
LAUGHS SADLY AT SELF LMAO
also I have to say that I used to be one of those people who's always like "ugh I hate kids!!!!" just cause I was tryin to be edgy and cool
I'm gonna like fill a whole page with drawings of this omg I'm so pumped
I love my dreams so much holy shit I dream of Sonic (aka Silver) almost every day and it always gives me new ideas for drawings ;;;;;;;;
BUT IT GAVE ME A LOT OF IDEAS FOR NEW DRAWINGS OMFG I'M SO MOTIVATED TO DRAW THIS NOW IT WAS CUTE AS FUCK
IT WAS SO FUCKING CUTE!!!!!!!! AND THEN MY FUCKIN ALARM RANG I'M SO MAD?????!?!???? SHIT
was like "OH NO YOU ARE SO CUTE......." and hugged him omfg rip
and then Rouge (I think? or Amy) came and looked at him and he was all like "hey look what I drew!!" and smiled at her and she
and Silver was doodling something and he was so cute oh lord save me
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT SILVER AND SONIC AND OTHER CHARACTERS AS LITTLE KIDS AND THE FEMALE CHARACTERS WERE LOOKIN OUT FOR THEM BYE
my god I had the cutest dream of all time oh jesus guys help me
HELLO FRIENDS
oh well I'm going to bed good night
this is what I hate so much about tumblr, even if you delete the original post the reblogs are still there ugh why
I found an old nsfw pic of mine via google image search on tumblr oh my god I'm going to die no
I'm still not sure about doing this
can someone help me think of rewards for people who support me on patreon???? aaaaaaaaaa
NEVERMIND I FIXED IT
ah yes I love it when the browser you're using makes you add stuff that you don't even want like really thanks this is stressing me out
for real tho that kills the man
my sexual orientation: Silver in that one skintight suit
@ LRT oh my GOD OH MY FUKICNNG GOGOD!!!!!!!!!!! OH MY GFS
@oldmanshadow I know what you mean omg........ though with some stuff I'm really just glad when it's gone lol
@IcyCM24 VERY TRUE though he's always gay, with or without chest fur
I just added like 15 drawings to scraps omg if this keeps up I will never reach 100 deviations lmao
@sanjitoofancy NO IT'S OK FRIENDO
@maddzee that looks so cool I LOVE HER MORE BY THE SECOND
@sanjitoofancy damn headcanon destroyed............. well either way YOU LOOK NICE
@IcyCM24 tru I didnt even notice
MY NAME AIN'T SILVERFUCKR FOR NOTHIN'
well either way it's correct
this is gonna sound real weird but Silver looks so cute from behind omfg 
I JUST READ TOXIC'S BACKSTORY IT SOUNDS RLY COOL good job friendo @maddzee
@sanjitoofancy tbh whenever I talk to you I feel like I'm talking to jontron like the icon does so much for me
@maddzee HMMMMMM KIND OF I THINK??? DEPENDING ON WHICH CANON???? OH WELL TRU THO
@maddzee THAT'S COOL THOUGH why did you scrap that idea
I say "lol" and "hehe" and all that shit rly often and use dumb cheesy smileys a lot I feel like a 50 year old or something
@sanjitoofancy I am amazed
@KawaiiBee YEAH EXACTLY but I love em anyways lol
@maddzee @craciaci how did I not think of this............ or maybe she fell in some toxic waste
@craciaci @maddzee it's like she started doing drugs lol JK I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
I just remembered how much I love Silvamy
well sometimes it does mean I'm mad but not when I talk to others, just when I complain about shit lol
btw when I type in capslock that just means I'm excited or something it never means I wanna yell at you or that I'm mad JUST FYI
@sanjitoofancy sorry for yellin I get excited a lot
@KawaiiBee thank you &lt;3 I kinda have a love-hate relationship with drawing those things lol
@sanjitoofancy YEAH TRU BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME
@13aymax HMMMM I LIKE B MORE

someone on da honestly wanted me to redraw that big enough so I could put it on my redbubble account cause they want it on a jacket omfg
ah I forgot the circle on his left hand I'M GLAD I NOTICED
doing redraws is really motivating tbh
please look how fucking bad that looked omfg it looks so much better now BYE
did a redraw of this really lame pic lol it's less than two months old 
drawing doesnt make me very happy lately it just stresses me out haha,,,,,,,
@SilverHeckr @Hooru01 CRIES STOP THIS
@SilverHeckr @Hooru01 I WISH but thank you omg don't be so cute to me
@13aymax you should take a photo when you get them omg
@13aymax NICE omg I would buy them too if I could
I wish I was as cool and interesting and creative as other people laughs @ self
@silverfuckr I'm glad people are RTing this
@maddzee go to your profile, then on the poll click "edit this widget" and then choose a poll and delete it :o hope that helps
also its not coloured so you can't see how much my colouring improved hhhhhh
oh well that was just for fun I'm probably never gonna finish that i'm too lazy
still looks weird af lol 
@Hooru01 AH OK that'd be nice 8)
@MothTolias thank you haha :'o I don't always put that much effort into it though lol
@MothTolias YEAH maybe I should. and thanks ;v;
@Hooru01 hmm they're just glowing because of Silver's telekinesis but either way would be cool!!

I never really wanted drawing to become a "job" for me, well maybe in like 10 or 20 years lol but not now.... BUT
aaaaaaa,,,,,, I want to open up a Patreon tbh but I bet no one would want to spend money on my lame art anyways lol
@posilutelysoa LAUGHS it's from some christmas comic I did. it was a sonilver comic and amy was jealous idk it was bad

Ken Penders
I look forward so much to living alone I just wanna live in peace and quiet without having to worry about every little tiny detail
@Prowertastic tru but the comics are bullshit mostly anyways lol
@sonicova well it was written by Ken penders I dont think I have to say anything else 
@sonicova thank u &lt;3
@sonicova I wish I made that up but I didn't
@Hooru01 BUT I'M PUMPED TO SEE YOUR DRAWING
@Hooru01 I just thought that'd be cool since chao often have these gradients on their.... fur or whatever
@Hooru01 you mean a Silver chao in general? or just the fact that his arms and legs are turqouise :o?
@takoyakiboi DLEETE THISIHT
@Hooru01 they're just turquoise lol IDK but they're also kinda glowing a bit because of his telekinesis
just read the description omg also that's turquoise not blue :,)
of course someone had to ask why his eyes are "blue"
@espectalll123 THANKS LOL
I had a dream about this so I just had to draw it... I wish Silver Chao were a thing 
@love_nekos I wish I made this up
@takoyakiboi OF COURSE....... and omfg stop I'm crying just imagining it
@takoyakiboi IT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS GHHGFGHF CAN I SUE PENDERS PLEASE
like try to make it more creative and have more to do with the supernatural and fantasy elements in the Sonic world and not real life drama
@posilutelysoa I'M CRYING SO HARD AT THIS SOA WHAT EVEN
I'm sorry but that's so ridiculous?????? also the whole relationship bullshit goes wayyyy too far
Silver lives in a dystopian future? yes! Sally gets roboticized? yes! Tails has no parents? yes! Charmy's friend dies of drug overdose? no!
also LSD = LEMON SUNDROP DANDELION
I AM NOT JOKING
I'm not joking I didn't make that up it's true 
thing I learned today: in the Archie Comics, Charmy has a friend called Mello who died from a drug overdose, more specifically LSD. rip
@EduConnectionz @mizkepler I'M CRYING BYE
@mizkepler he is omfg
@mizkepler WHAT KINDA DRUGS WERE THEY ON
@mizkepler wtf even is this
wtf is wrong with my internet connection did someone deploy an emp or what
it's even funnier 'cause we're German otherwise it'd only be half as funny
SHE GOT REALLY MAD AND STARTED YELLING EVEN MORE BUT IT WAS WORTH IT TBH I'M STILL LAUGHING OVER IT
my mom yelled at me for stupid shit again earlier and bossed me around and I just replied to her with "Ja, mein Führer" lmao
@japhetgrindr same
also. it says "mustard madness act one" SO WILL THERE BE MORE????? CAUSE I WILL CRY THEN
ok but I just realized. that off-panel I freaked out about today... my question is: ARE THEY ON A DATE????
@takoyakiboi NO YOU DID I like hearing people's opinions, it helps me more than just "looks good" or something lol (tho that's nice too ofc)
I kinda wanna watch brokeback mountain again but also I would rather stab myself in the heart since that's the same feeling
@takoyakiboi that might be too much on the eyes maybe hmm. I actually think I'm happy with how it looks rn though x) thanks for the help!!
@takoyakiboi yeah like right at the beginning ;v; i thought it looked too soft or something hmmmm. there's so many possibilities lol orz
@takoyakiboi make Silver and the Chao stand out lol. I just hope it's not too hard on the eyes
@takoyakiboi I tried that at first, a light background I mean, and I think that would look too dull I think?? I want the background to like
@Yentruocton no that's what Silver is
@takoyakiboi THAT LOOKS TRIPPY...... tbh I wanted to keep it mostly simple, so just a limited color palette hmmm
*acts like I'm some kind of professional artist discussing color theory when I'm really just drawing stupid Sonic fanart*
@takoyakiboi it's not even halfway done anyways heh x) and I do most of the editing at the end in Photoshop. so we will see!
@Yentruocton thank you, but I don't do it for the money. it's just a noble deed that has to be done
@takoyakiboi I'LL LOOK AGAIN TOMORROW I wanna call it a day for now anyways lol. thank you though &lt;3
@sorainmypants thank you ;v;
@Yentruocton ABSOLUTELY all day every day
@takoyakiboi THANKS I did and I think the more green I make it the worse it looks lol, I think I actually need to make it a bit more blue
@ThatWriterKino thanks 8) and YEAH SAME if I get my hands on one you'll get one lmao
@KawaiiBee thank you hehe
@chefmiddleton thanks!
@JJEmily_8 thank you!! 'o'
@Yentruocton IT'S OK IT HAPPENS TO THE BEST PEOPLE
@IBLiSSTRiGGER YEAH i think so too
@silverfuckr @takoyakiboi I dont like the more turqoise background, what do you think :o
if I had one wish I'd wish to actually be good at Jet Set Radio
@sonicova THEY'RE ALL V CUTE YES I like that channel
"you dense motherfucker" is one of my fave insults tbh
@sonicova I KNOW THAT FIRST ONE ACTUALLY YOU POSTED IT ONCE AND I LOVE IT

THIS IS SO COOL AAAAAAAAAA YES LET'S EXPLORE SILVER'S POWERS MORE PLEASE AND THANK YOU 
Sonic just wants some luvin

Sonic what are you doing CLOSE YOUR LEGS SMH 
I'M CRYING AT THIS PIC.......... HE'S LIKE "WHEEEEEEEEE" 
its like oh you have tattoos well too bad you fuck we're not gonna hire you bye
and I really hate that cause tbh I want tattoos like all over my arms but everyone would see then and AAAAAAAAAA
I really wanna get SO MANY TATTOOS but considering how shitty this world and everyone is employers often don't like ppl with tattoos
@RakugakiSquid that must be like an AU me then cause I never leave the house in rl
I couldn't use them for a while then BUT.......... IT'D BE SO COOL
but i'm probably too much of a wimp to actually do it lol also I need my hands for pretty much everything but especially drawing so
I once had the idea to get tattoos on my hands that look like the symbols on Silver's hands like would that be hella rad or what
@japhetgrindr snar
@RakugakiSquid WOW RUDE
also yes I am a dirty furry live with it
I love this artist so much 
@RakugakiSquid HAVE YOU BEEN CLONING ME WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE
now that I found the perfect icon on dA I don't think I'm ever gonna change it again, or well at least not in the near future lmao
@RakugakiSquid that's why I don't read comments most of the time lmao
my appreciation for Silver will never end sorry everyone
@SpeedHighway I'M SORRY???? LOL
