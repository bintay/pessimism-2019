@ultra_stew @UltraBoyRuns I'm not advocating the change, just found the stats, graphs &amp; outcomes interesting.
C'mon, Phil, just passing Farmoor Reservoir. Keep moving, keep your head and you'll be fine. #rootingForYou
@windsorAndy Ya-a-a-y!! Well done, bud!!
@UltraRunnerDan Mate, an epic day. Happy that you got there. Here's to Winchester and after that b*stard, to Eastbourne!!
@UltraDHC @TheGingerKenyan @ultrabritton Maybe Rick can be the new bloke on the Bodyform adverts? Do they still do Bodyform? #BodyformForYou
@BigPhil137 trawling up alongside Port Meadow on #T60. Go, Phil!!!
@UltraDHC You mean @TheGingerKenyan could be as famous as @ultrabritton?  <FLUSHED FACE>
@funkysimmm @BigPhil137 Best of luck, guys. I'll be checking in on the app.
@mia79gbr #mtfu
@TheGingerKenyan Um, kudos?
@BenjiiMcKnight Like a whore?
@UltraAvon @Susie__Chan @SpontaneousPlan Saved for later. I expect gratuitous awesomeness!!
@ultrareluctant @ogeerunner @D0lly0blong When there was no speaking...
@ultra_stew No wonder it takes you four years between ultras....
@ultra_stew Go running on the Thames?
@TobiasMews Best of luck!!
@imoutrunning It used to be the Cardiff Ultra until it disappeared. You should look up the route for the Brecon Beacons Ultra Cc @Likeys
@imoutrunning Taff Trail's a 50 mile jaunt down to Cardiff.
@mia79gbr "I'm sorry, you just look awful. Isn't it about time you called it 'quits' and hop into the car so we can all go home?"
@d10barker Still worth a retweet.
@ogeerunner Just tell them the veggie bacon boat is on the invisible boat on the other side of the river.
@ogeerunner That. Is. Brilliant.
@BigPhil137 You'll be fine, mate. Just take it easy and I'll see you in Winchester in June.
@TheGingerKenyan Mate, hope it holds out for you. #getThePodiumOrDontComeHome
@mia79gbr And at the most inappropriate moments, screamimg, "MAN THE F**K UP!!" #mtfu
@SpontaneousPlan @Susie__Chan Daily pants? #livingTheDream
@TheGingerKenyan And how is the knee..?
@BigPhil137 @funkysimmm @GrahamCarterGC Seconded. @davegromitcox is on kit check &amp; at CP2 in Radcot, he'll look after you. #topRunner
@UltraBoyRuns Well done for winning your own personal war!!
@ogeerunner Obama is actually Farage's boss, isn't he?
More from the #TP100... what it's like to crew c/o @RaversRTW 
Hope I'm as happy as this guy in the morning. 
@imoutrunning @d10barker Ideally, yes. But only just started putting together ideas for SDW yesterday so nothing's in place yet.
@imoutrunning @ogeerunner @ultra_stew @d10barker Think someone pacing stops your head going to bad places. Body just carries on regardless.
@imoutrunning @d10barker Which I won't take credit for without mentioning the crew or the pacer.  <WINKING FACE>
@imoutrunning @d10barker I wasn't fit enough for last weekend so opted to use everything available to me - crew, pacer, etc.
@UltraDHC @d10barker @ogeerunner @ultra_stew @imoutrunning #beautySleep
@ogeerunner @ultra_stew @imoutrunning @d10barker I mentally falter in the closing half. If I've got someone, I move or move with purpose...
@imoutrunning @d10barker I can vouch for pacers. Mine from mile 80 helped me claw back 30-40 places.
@stupid_runner @ogeerunner @TrailDragon @UltraDHC Like so... 
@abradypus I was indeed. Had a miserable time but remember it fondly. Not that I've spent any time today trying to track my running stats. <WINKING FACE>
Bored of the #TP100? Surely you've read @d10barker's account of how he podiums &amp; is then unable to descend stairs <WINKING FACE> 
@abradypus Random observation... You were at Rutland Water Marathon in 2012!!
@ultra_stew ...and good luck for the next one. Love the race "begins at 80 miles". 
@ultra_stew Nice to meet you before the start, mate, congratulations on the finish. Great (and detailed) write up...
@stupid_runner @ogeerunner Ghostbusters!!!
@Running_Bucky I refer you to 
@richwalkslondon @abradypus Nice write up, Rich, congratulations on the finish, thanks for the stats and best of luck with GUCR.  <GRINNING FACE>
@thompson_sj @fromboris Apologies, I'm clueless. Running abroad comes next year...
@girlyrunner1 Pyramids?
'I will RUN through a camping site'?
Or 
'I will RAN through a camping site'?
(Cos it's past tents)
@ootboxford Why are you playing a Wednesday this year and not a Friday? I can't start my weekend that early...  <CRYING FACE>
@UltraDHC @TheGingerKenyan Utterly f**king grim... Cc @ultra_stew @imoutrunning @UltraBoyRuns
@girlyrunner1 Happy days indeed...
@imoutrunning @ultra_stew God, my bowels on the TP after Dorney... Almost tweeted a pic...  <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> <PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO><PILE OF POO>
@ultra_stew @ogeerunner Have you noticed how @MaxWillcocks won TP100 &amp; finished his blog first? Is there any correlation?
"Can you stab boar?"

          "Maybe, I think.          I mean, YES!!!"

"Then you can run ultra."

#sponsoredByKittens
@TheGingerKenyan If I can invoke dark magic for you, I will. Rest up, mate.

@UltraDHC Yeh, I thought that...  <CONFOUNDED FACE>
@abradypus See you in Winchester!!  <GRINNING FACE>
@abradypus Loved the write up. It was like reliving the whole thing over again. And the pic with @LondonNici72 at registration is quality.
@ultrareluctant @ogeerunner Why ever not? Rant away. The world needs more opinionated runners!!
@ogeerunner @ultrareluctant Probably should be less cheeky... planning to #runToTheBaconBoatForFreeBacon a week on Saturday.
@ogeerunner @ultrareluctant 
@ogeerunner @ultrareluctant C'mon, guys, you're missing the obvious after last weekend... #willKitCheckForFreeStuff  <WINKING FACE>
@ogeerunner @ultrareluctant I was tempted to ask... "Who needs free stuff most? RT for @ogeerunner and Favourite for @ultrareluctant"
Ran, nay, sprinted for the bus this morning. May need to road test these legs further at lunch.
@Judie_Judie Have a gander at @MemesUltra
@seesteverun Cheers, I'll take a look
@Ashton378 Good luck, mate. I look forward to watching your progress.  <GRINNING FACE>
@TheGingerKenyan Something for you, in case you missed it... 
@seesteverun What's the app?
Good for offline reading?
Ok, finished the #TP100 and decision made. My assault on the @centurionrunner Grand Slam continues. Up next? #SDW100
@JediRider @UltraBevo If Matt's as quick as he normally is, you'll be done when I get to Washington. #damnLongLegs
@JediRider @UltraBevo Pace me, pace me!! I'll be slower but full of more cheer &amp; have plenty of snazzy (flat) one liners. #poachThatPacer
@FromSofaToUltra I struggled with the "why am I doing this" for a long spell. Hope you find some enjoyment again soon. #ultraFun
@UltraBevo ...just not at a pace I could muster &amp; sustain for another 5 hrs. Hoping the familiarity of the last 50 on SDW will help.
@UltraBevo My head went to a dark place from miles 70-77 on TP, when it started working &amp; I realised sub 24 hrs was still possible...
@UltraBevo Feeling quite happy, optimistic, not too achy, that stairs aren't evil ... well, basically SDW100 isn't out of the question.  <GRINNING FACE>
@UltraBevo Looks like a warm up for a 100 mile race, minimum!!
Up AND down stairs this morning, from the 2nd floor no less, without need of a handrail. #TP100 #feelingSuperhuman
@stupid_runner Mate, gutted for you but your exploits, for better or worse, remain colourful. See you in Winchester.
@seesteverun @UltraBoyRuns Hahaha... you think I'll be running by the time I get to Kent. #utterMadness
@UltraBoyRuns Cheers, man. Possibly heading to Kent in August on the NDW...  <WINKING FACE>
@UltraBoyRuns What was wrong with the last 49 miles for you?
@UltraBoyRuns 
"I'm bored"
"I've had enough"
"I'm just gonna DNF and go home"
@UltraBoyRuns Just struggled to get a rhythm going from mile 70 to 77. Massive sulky crash disguised as a hissy fit.
@UltraBoyRuns I checked in when it was quiet then waited outside. Just as busy outside. Far too many ultra runners &amp; entourages.  <WINKING FACE>
@UltraBoyRuns Man, I was wearing exactly what I'm wearing in my Twitter pic... I know though, there were loads of people I didn't see.  <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@UltraBoyRuns I'm starting to think that you're avoiding me. Yeh, I'm happy. Hoped for more but couldn't sustain it in the middle. And you?
@Ashton378 Strong? Jesus, I fell to pieces after you passed me just after Moulsford. Good to meet you in person. See you in Winchester.
@jamie_woods Mate, no worries. Shame not to see you but thanks for leaving a finish line for me to get to. <WINKING FACE>
@1ElevenNorth @UltraRunnerDan Personally, I'd say that SDW is tougher &amp; then NDW more so. Although Dan would be an authority with 3 finishes
What's next? #SDW100 
Finished this year's #TP100 in 26:28:46, a PB of over 3 hrs. Much credit to Jemima, Jonathan (crew) &amp; Dave (pacer). 
@JonFielden @natasha_fielden @funkysimmm Joviality aside, congratulations!!
@imoutrunning Who on earth would ever be that foolish?
@imoutrunning Trying not to think to far ahead but a finish at the A100 would turn the tide in my favour.
@JonFielden @funkysimmm @natasha_fielden Isn't it only worrying if your first cousins? Who's keeping tabs on the 'cousins' legislation?  <WINKING FACE>
@JonFielden @funkysimmm @natasha_fielden I thought you guys were cousins!!
I now have two finishes from six starts for 100 milers. #TP100 #turningTheTide
@seesteverun Rest. Nothing more than that until tomorrow. #SDW100
God, must be a sign that I'm ok to put my feet up if the wife's insisting on cutting the lawn.
That said, I will be resting up, trying to get fat and watching rubbish on TV  #TP100recovery
So walked the dog this morning, ambled about a garden centre this afternoon... slow &amp; a bit achy but feel I could manage a 5K.  <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@runaulait @jamie_woods I thought that was only applicable to Whitchurch...
@UltraDHC Surely easier than 2013?
@UltraRunnerDan I promised myself that I'm not gonna think about any ultras until ... tomorrow. Content to be happily achy today.
@UltraRunnerDan Wheels fell off between Whitchurch &amp; Wallingford. Managed to get around in 26.5 hrs. Too soon to be thinking about SDW100?
@UltraDHC @JonFielden @ultrareluctant @natasha_fielden Thanks, all. Like seeing people I know along the course. Bit dazed at the end though.
@JonFielden No worries, man, and thanks.
@seesteverun Less achy than yesterday... But wish we hadn't bought a house with a loft conversion.  <WEARY FACE>
@seesteverun I'd been tempted to enter, just for the sheer lunacy. It would have made for the longest back to back runs I'd ever mustered.
@sw_mackenzie @naominf ...I could be tempted to do it all again in six weeks.  <ATHLETIC SHOE><ATHLETIC SHOE>
@sw_mackenzie @naominf Allegedly... Any ruminations on the Grand Slam are on hold until tomorrow. Less achy today, less tired...
@fromboris I was happy into Henley, eased off up to Whitchurch, struggled along to Wallingford and then beasted the last 20 from Benson.  <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
Favourite meme from TP100 CP7... c/o @Susie__Chan @SpontaneousPlan @UltraAvon @windsorAndy #thanksGuys 
@naominf ...yesterday, I would have traded my buckle for a zimmer frame.  <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@naominf Feeling ok. I hate the bit when you finally stop &amp; everything seizes, almost instantly. Been propping myself up like an old fart...
Ok, v. achy. Time for a bad night's kip...
@UltraDHC Either way, glad it didn't stop... TP100 finisher aka #DHC.
@abradypus ...didn't enjoy the TP100 as much as I thought I was going to. Unsure whether my heart's in all this wonderful nonsense.  <CONFOUNDED FACE>
@abradypus I'm achy today, guessing I'll be achy tomorrow. Opting to take time before pushing ahead. Loved the PB today but...
@DaveReynier Congratulations!!
@UltraDHC Despite the blackout, bloody strong finish though!!
@abradypus No further comment until Tuesday. Dear lord, the notion that we'll be doing this all again in under six weeks isn't welcome...
@Judie_Judie Last 30 felt like hell, but v. glad to have stuck with it for the finish.  <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@UltraDHC 30.5 miles. You came in just as I was leaving, then I had to go &amp; use a buff in the bushes.
@ultra_stew Last third was where my pacer @davegromitcox beasted me and we made up 32 places. Ground was v. awkward in places though.
@abradypus Well done!! Nice to see you again.
@naominf Another notch on the roster of awesome. Well done, Naomi. <GRINNING FACE>
@runaulait Good to meet you this weekend &amp; thanks for the Whitchurch to Streatley section.
@GrahamCarterGC Cracking effort.  <GRINNING FACE>
@GrahamCarterGC Thanks, GC
@RewRunner Well done, Rew!!
@UltraRunnerDan Well done, Dan. Happy to see you finish!!
@UltraDHC @seesteverun Cheers, guys, had a very wobbly stretch between Whitchurch and Wallingford.
@stupid_runner Sorry to hear that, mate.
@toks Sorry to hear that. Still a bloody long way though.
@UltraDHC Well done, bud. You looked comfortable when you passed me just after Dorney.
@MichLR_ Thanks <GRINNING FACE>
@funkysimmm Upsetting the chicken is bad karma!!! #TP100
@Judie_Judie Thanks. All pinned up as #10 <GRINNING FACE>
Bloody seamless registration this morning c/o @ogeerunner @ultrareluctant #TP100
@JediRider Cheers, mate
@jamie_woods Literally...  <GRINNING FACE>  Grew up 2 miles from the finish.  <HOUSE BUILDING>
@JediRider Just checked... Just made double digits, I'm #10
@JediRider No idea, to be honest. <WINKING FACE>  Waiting to see what bib I get in the morning.
@MarkPatton82 Ah, yes. I'll see if I can't get Jon to broadcast updates. Laters, enjoy the wedding.  <BEER MUG><BEER MUG>
@MarkPatton82 On the mail?
T-minus 12 hrs until game time. Where in Richmond can you get an almighty fry up? Laters #TP100
@MarkPatton82 See you at the Queen's College Recreation Ground?
En route to Richmond, drove past Benson, Shillingford, Maple Durham, Reading &amp; Windsor. #goingBackwards #TP100
Is it time yet? #TP100
@GrahamCarterGC True but SDW100 only exists if I beast the Thames... River first, hills later.
@ninjarunr @stupid_runner Not that we're siblings or share a Master of Magnetism for a father.
@ninjarunr @stupid_runner Sam's like Quicksilver ... I'm more like the Scarlet Witch.
@GrahamCarterGC And to you. I'll try not to remember how sensible you are on miles 53 to 100.
@stupid_runner I was hoping that the adamantium would give my own efforts a fighting chance. How about CGI claws à la Hugh Jackman?
@UltraRunnerDan @conwild @1ElevenNorth @UltraDHC @UltraBoyRuns @naominf Ditto and totally seconded.
@toks I like the red garment on the left. Red Riding Hood runs the Thames!! #fancyDress
Pup's in kennels for the weekend.  <CRYING FACE>  I'm feeling emotional. It must be the #TP100...  <FLUSHED FACE> 
@SpontaneousPlan @UltimateUpdates @Susie__Chan So is this the honeymoon?
@jamesradams @ogeerunner But when a duck says quack, don't they just mean quack?
@stupid_runner Good news, bud. Only draw back is that you now need to run with a set of claws on each hand.
@rodviggers Cheers, bud
@jamesradams No. #naturesLaw
@rodviggers @centurionrunner Thanks, we'll find out by 2pm on Sunday...
Under 36 hrs to #TP100... Time to sleep and get the final prep together in the morning. Loving the new buckle @centurionrunner
@Coxwolds 4 yrs ago, I told my wife I could cook. 4 yrs later, that's still exactly what I churn out. #gourmet
@UltraDHC In Oxford, the ducks say it's wet.
@flingrace @centurionrunner @adidasUK @flipbelt @xbionicuk @mulebar @suu…
@TheGingerKenyan @centurionrunner You shouldn't be on a Shetland pony, you should be honing your finest vulture / Mr Burns impression
@TheGingerKenyan @centurionrunner Literally? Do you have any toes left?
@stupid_runner Blend some OJ, some chicken soup &amp; a 370g (approx.) block of cheese. #worksEveryTime
@UltraBoyRuns That's probably for the best though, isn't it? It's like some natural order stepping in... #keepThePeanutButter
@SpontaneousPlan Pop Tarts: the new Twinkie!!
@DaveReynier @SpontaneousPlan And you, see you in Richmond.
@UltraBoyRuns Good job that you don't run on your hands.
@natasha_fielden @abradypus The G&amp;Ds on St. Aldate's has a bike. You could always ask them to pop down to the finish...  <SOFT ICE CREAM>
@SpontaneousPlan Nice cold but wondered whether I could warm myself up with a toastie pop tart. Good to know they're desert friendly though.
@SpontaneousPlan Got a toaster in Reading?
@seesteverun @jamesradams has written a book?
1st food shop done for #TP100. Still feel like I need more sustenance. Pop tarts?
@UltraRunnerDan @1ElevenNorth @conwild How on earth did you survive all that #Bryansgoneforapoo nonsense?
@UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC No, it's Sandford, about 2 miles from the end.
@naominf I'm either in denial or going to war. Hate playing the weather lottery.  <CRYING FACE>  <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️  <SUN BEHIND CLOUD>️  <CLOUD>️  <HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN>️  <UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>️
@imoutrunning <OX><OX><OX><OX><OX><OX><OX>
@imoutrunning I don't remember any cows on the SDW. NDW on the other hand... Lordy, those b*stards were the size of caravans!! #fearTheCow
@imoutrunning Cows on the TP or SDW? I know a cr*ppy section after Shillingford, en route to Clifton Hampden, with uneven ground + COWS!!!!!
@imoutrunning Love the Thames (esp. Whitchurch to Streatley) but SDW's much nicer, rolling hills with views in every direction.
@imoutrunning ...both ways on several occasions. Now, just watch me get lost this weekend.  <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@imoutrunning Managed a 29 hrs 37 mins 10 sec finish on SDW in 2013 - my first. Comfortable with the Thames though, run Oxford to Henley...
@imoutrunning @LavaredoUT Ultra sightseeing on tour.  #loveIt  And I mean why ever not? Best way to see places
@imoutrunning Feeling ok about SDW100 but need to recce last 25 of NDW100 &amp; Ridgeway sections of A100.
@imoutrunning I'm sure I meant ankle...  <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>  @LavaredoUT sounds like fun.
@imoutrunning What's next for you? How's your Achilles?
@imoutrunning Surprisingly well... Unfit but now have crew until 9am Sunday morning &amp; a pacer from 80 miles. Labelling it my #fightingChance
@imoutrunning Just drop them a message telling them that it's their fault that they couldn't be there a day earlier... #todayIsWednesday
@imoutrunning So? Why's that your fault? Just start your weekend a day early!! #todayIsWednesday
@seesteverun Well, lined up crew &amp; all of the creature comforts that I can muster until 9am on Sunday morning. #onlyNeedToRun
@seesteverun Are you kidding? I'll be moving on stubbornness alone...  <WEARY FACE>
@seesteverun Yes... You should be... That was supposed to be #nextYear!
@seesteverun #nextTweet
@suttonelc Bl**dy impressive!!
@seesteverun @UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan @naominf Um, @runaulait, @abradypus and @d10barker.
@UltraBoyRuns @seesteverun @UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan @naominf @stupid_runner's on board &amp; I believe @CaptWonderPants...
@JonLavis See? It was fun.  <WINKING FACE>
@mikew30 How many runners in tutus were there?  <FLUSHED FACE>
@1ElevenNorth Wowsers!! That's impressive for the running as well as the speedy travelling between the two!! Good luck, mate.
@MarkPatton82 @abradypus I like to think that I'm still faster even with an 80-90 mile handicap. #delusionsOfGrandeur
@abradypus @MarkPatton82 Can't believe the lengths that some people will go to fabricate excuses to avoid a little bit of pacing...  <CRYING FACE>
@abradypus @MarkPatton82 That's fair play. Guessing that's the same guy that you had along for the W100?
@abradypus @MarkPatton82 What's more important than crewing an ultra runner through the night, while they're slowly falling to pieces?
@abradypus @MarkPatton82 We've occasionally run from Oxford to Abingdon PR, which is a grand start to any weekend.
@abradypus I've told @MarkPatton82 that the river is flat but he doesn't believe me.
@abradypus @MarkPatton82 If only I could rope someone into pacing... How about you? Did you recce down to Abingdon or Benson today?
@abradypus @MarkPatton82 Ha, no. Need to buy some munch. My crew is all signed up though but too enthusiastic, which I'm hoping won't hurt.
@1ElevenNorth Blackouts aside, sounded like fun... Recommended?
@mikew30 @flingrace Well done, Mike. Is it a PB as standard these days then? #luckyTutu #whoDidYouChaseThisTime?
#visitScotland 
@1ElevenNorth Well done, chief.
@abradypus Ah, that would be @MarkPatton82, who didn't think the SDW was hilly because he's from up north where they have "real" hills...
Productive evening labouring under the notion that I'll actually get far enough on #TP100 to use the crew that I've lined up #thankYouMyers
#dreamRace 
@JonLavis Fun?
@cooker44 @mikew30 No matter how fast you run, there's always a man in tutu trying to chase you down...
@1ElevenNorth Nah, not yet but ordered some Bodyglide &amp; hoping to get my shit together this weekend while you're out running on my behalf...
@1ElevenNorth Good luck this weekend, chief.

@Rhalou @flingrace @ultrabritton Best of luck this weekend. Nice to see the advice is essentially, "stay calm and enjoy yourself."
@ultraperk Trying to follow in your footsteps, just struggling to get my head around the stats...  <WINKING FACE>
@ultraperk Allegedly in for the Grand Slam but I'm 100% in denial about it.
Going back to square one around old haunts has been the most fun running done in months, almost a year. #TP100 
@imoutrunning @TheGingerKenyan @Transvulcania Or it was the only pic in focus...
Leisurely 5K warm up with @richmondparkrun or @OldDeerparkrun before #TP100? Anyone?
Couple of laps of Christchurch Meadow. Beautiful day on the river. #TP100 

@d10barker @UltraBoyRuns Seen that track three times now, twice from Worthing &amp; once from Eastbourne. Seem to get faster every time.
@d10barker @UltraBoyRuns I point you in the direction of 
@UltraBoyRuns I'm stealing your space blanket. Let's see you pass kit check without that bad boy.
@UltraBoyRuns Not if I win it first!!
@UltraBoyRuns Figure I'd try &amp; not kid myself for a change...
@Running_Bucky Plan A's definitely to win the thing with a course PB...... Plan B is a singer.  <UNAMUSED FACE>

Crafted a meticulous plan for TP100. Sadly, it's 40 mins over the dream target of 24 hrs and is probably also too optimistic. #bugger

This is why.

So excited to be doing this race in 2016 with @Susie__Chan 
@TeamB_O_B @_THE_WIFE_ Happy anniversary!!
#unstoppable  
@SamanthaBowden3 It does claim to be a 100 miler. Whether or not I clock that distance is another matter...
@SamanthaBowden3 Ach! It's a week on Saturday, running from Richmond back to Oxford along the Thames...  <FLUSHED FACE>
@1ElevenNorth Not me...  <CRYING FACE>

At least not yet... #daysNotOver
@SamanthaBowden3 Kudos, bunny. Get your niggles sorted &amp; race stronger next time.  <GRINNING FACE>
@mikew30 @cooker44 Yay!! Good show. I hope to hit that mark one day before I croak.
@PaulAskew_ YouTube? Accompanied by die hard fan made videos? #liveTheDream
@mikew30 @Marathon_Mcr Good luck, Mike!!
@RugbyUppers While you're running? #admirable
Parkrun #23 completed this morning, so I technically earned three of those cupcakes.
For every mile I didn't run today, I ate a cupcake.
@imoutrunning I do love how many races you stack up. Hope you make the next one.  <GRINNING FACE>
@imoutrunning Ballache, buggery &amp; damnation. #swiftRecovery
@SamanthaBowden3 @plymouthhalf Good luck, bunny!! #shameItsNotOnAMayBankHolidayAnymore
Have you seen this man? #sinister 
@jamie_woods @loobylins Balancing a tart on your knee? How long for? Are you allowed to eat it when it gets dark?
@ultraperk Best of the best, mate. #stormTheCastle
15 miles clocked in total today. Plenty of odd jobs about the house done &amp; dusted. Saw some friends &amp; even managed a couple of pints. #sleep
@toks Petrified &amp; excited in equal measure sounds about right.
Alarm at 5am this morning. Actually got out of bed. Left the house at 6am and chalked up 9½ miles. Very happy. #timeForBreakfast
@BenjiiMcKnight Highlights from Unipart #davidsPenis 
@toks Hey Tinu, had a long break from Twitter. Sorry to hear about marathon #47. All set for TP100?
@Susie__Chan @SpontaneousPlan Massive congratulations, guys, on the MdS and the engagement. How do you plan an ultra wedding?
@Susie__Chan @SpontaneousPlan As I haven't caught the One Show yet, I feel like I've been told the ending of The Sixth Sense.
@UltraDHC @Judie_Judie @UltraRunnerDan Silver dude is Ultron. Spangly red woman is Captain Marvel.
@ogeerunner @craig_secure @gems_carter @SalomonRunning Is it because we said "bad boys"?
@imoutrunning Good luck this weekend.  <WINKING FACE>
@imoutrunning Kudos (from the Ancient Greek: κῦδος) is acclaim or praise for exceptional achievement. #thanksWiki
@imoutrunning Haha, kudos.
@UltraAvon Similar exp. w/ sleep &amp; lack of sustenance on SDW50 recently. Result rescued by @MarkPatton82 &amp; lots of food. #miseryLovesCompany
@UltraBevo @MarkPatton82 Well, he did spend two nights in Worthing and all the excitement that could muster.  <BEER MUG><BEER MUG>  Running was just a bonus.
@UltraBevo Having run SDW50 with @MarkPatton82 recently, I'll soon be trying to convince him that he wants to do it again in June...
@thompson_sj I get a buckle for running 10K, don't I? At least if I finish in under 24 hrs.
@seesteverun Did I not mention that? I ran 5K!!  <WINKING FACE>
@seesteverun Bit early to be carb loading for TP100, methinks.  <SLICE OF PIZZA><SLICE OF PIZZA><FRENCH FRIES><POULTRY LEG><BREAD><CHOCOLATE BAR><CHOCOLATE BAR><SHORTCAKE>
Ok, 5K this morning. 1/2 bag of oven chips, 1 baguette, 2 kievs, 2 large bars of chocolate &amp; a Domino's this evening. #gluttony #grandFail
@imoutrunning @TheGingerKenyan Haven't you heard? It's sand now, not snow. That's where the hipsters are running. #flashInThePan

*pl…
@TheGingerKenyan Still yet to get onto the @Strava bandwagon...
@TheGingerKenyan I thought podium finishers did both... #disappointed
@UltraDHC @stupid_runner A day well spent... #nothingStolenFromGoogle 
Ok, it wasn't 5am &amp; it wasn't spectacular but dragged myself around 5K this morning. 1st shuffle since SDW50. Damn well feeling victorious!!
@TheGingerKenyan No shout out to @UltraDHC for the motivational speech this morning?
Setting alarm for 5am. And the likelihood of actually going for a run first thing?
@UltraDHC Sky Atlantic or Now TV for legal avenues.
@kendall_danny Fantastic result!!
@UltraDHC For the kids?
@ogeerunner @craig_secure @gems_carter @ultrareluctant @SalomonRunning Are we allowed to call them #badBoys now?
@gems_carter @craig_secure @ultrareluctant @SalomonRunning Thank god, I'm not alone. No shoes &amp; now #runningBarefoot
@naominf Congratulations on all three!
@RaversRTW Apparently it's a "sign" that you're a real runner when you start losing toe nails... So not true... #nothingButGum  <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
@RaversRTW How big must the tooth have been for the tooth fairy to give you that?


@mia79gbr Damn fine effort.  <GRINNING FACE>
@ultrabritton Fantastic result!! Sheer bloody phenomenal!! Much kudos!!


@toks Congratulations!
@Ashton378 Awesome show again. Any secret to the swift recovery from one run to another?
@RaversRTW @d10barker Massive congratulations!! Ultra next?
@martinbamford Mate, sorry to hear that. Sounds far too sensible. Hope the recovery speeds up.
@UltraAvon Well done!
@martinbamford What's happened with you? What's the outlook for June?
@jamie_woods Well done, mate. Looks very scenic.
@Susie__Chan @SpontaneousPlan Mahoosive congratulations, guys!!
@GrahamCarterGC Jesus, #SDW100's in 9 wks?! I was just shitting a brick over the #TP100 in 3 wks!! #FFS  <WEARY FACE>
@D0lly0blong 
@BenjiiMcKnight Kudos, Benji.
@d10barker @RaversRTW Best of luck!!
@UltraAvon Good luck!! Hope that you enjoy the loop of Portland.
"Let me show you how to be sexual with your nuts", the wife didn't say.
@ultrabritton Best of luck, Robbie!!



In case anyone missed it the first time. Share, re tweet and add in @NikeUK
@abradypus Good luck for Paris.  <WINKING FACE>  At least for TP100, I have a few weeks to find Richmond on a map.
Dreamt twice recently about running TP100. Both times, been late for the start, run in the wrong direction &amp; haven't had a clue. #bodesWell
@Ashton378 Well done again, chief. Appreciate the insights into your nutrition strategy!
@naominf I've read so many SDW50 blogs now, I feel like I should write one myself. I usually take pointers from your write ups so my thanks.
@marathonandmore Swift recovery!!
@ultrareluctant @ogeerunner @SalomonSports Heard that @TheGingerKenyan's podium finishes weren't even enough to get some. So I need to blog?
@ogeerunner @SalomonSports Ditto...
@UltraBevo Ha! Best of luck with that. Crackin' race to follow last year.
Probably time to start moving again tomorrow as I'm winning the war against the stairs. Recovery so far has been cheesecake &amp; coffee cake.
@UltraBevo Sorry to hear that, bud.
@GrahamCarterGC Thanks, chief, enjoy the trails. Looks awesome!!
@GrahamCarterGC Nice postcard. Where from?
@abradypus What about the ones just after the climb out of Whitchurch?  <WEARY FACE>
One step at a time. That's pretty much how the rest of my year is looking. Still battling stairs after #SDW50 on Saturday.
@bfp2030 Nuts? My body seems to be saying that. Think of the mental boost you'll get shortly after Washington on #SDW100... #knowThyCourse
@UltraBevo Better off by foot...
@funkysimmm That's the gran plan that I speak about sparingly in hushed tones...
@GrahamCarterGC After that, we'll see. I need to be better trained &amp; for my body to hold up better than it wasn't doing yesterday. #hopeful
@GrahamCarterGC Cheers, GC. Um, is it supposed to be going somewhere? After yesterday, I need to get my lungs working again.
@ogeerunner Laps of the fire pit? Sip of wine on every loop?
@funkysimmm Which 200?  <WINKING FACE>  Trying not to dwell on 100 miles of Thames Path in a month's time, completely forgetting the SDW in June...  <WEARY FACE>
@BigPhil137 Very happy for you, mate. Must put you in a good mindset for June's 100.
@funkysimmm Early breakfast in Worthing and the drive home. V. happy to be horizontal now. How's Sunday treating you?
@BigPhil137 Bumbled along to finish in about 11 hrs 15 mins. How about you? Did your back hold out?
@naominf And you, Naomi, good luck with the training for TP and GUCR.
@funkysimmm Came in at just under 11 hrs 15 mins.  <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@Judie_Judie Quite dazed post run but v. glad that I'm home now and able to be overly lazy. Yay for Easter!!
@naominf Cracking time. You looked very comfortable going into CP3. Thanks for the salt tablet.  <ATHLETIC SHOE><ATHLETIC SHOE>
@centurionrunner ps Lemon drizzle cake in Jevington was the #beesKnees, #daddysKnackers, #dogsBollocks... I could go on.
Huge thanks to @centurionrunner for today's #SDW50, amazing team of volunteers, singling out @jameselsons @LondonNici72 @UltraDHC @abradypus
@GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 Hey GC, how'd Phil get on? Phil, how's your back?
@craig_secure @MarkPatton82 No worries, bud. Congratulations on your finish, must have been good to finally put the blighter to sleep.
@funkysimmm Congratulations!! Managed to shave at least 1hr 45 mins off my shambolic and mostly blind 2013 effort.
@UltraBevo Sorry to hear that. Suffering from cramp mile 12 and now coughing my lungs up. Feeling awesome... May see you on the NDW50.
@funkysimmm Well done!!
@bfp2030 Much kudos!!
@UltraBevo Chief, did you not run today?
@Ashton378 Well done, mate, grand result.
@JonFielden Well run, bud.
So tired, I can't even take a decent selfie.  #SDW50 finished in about 11 hrs 10 mins.  Huge thanks to @MarkPatton82. 
@Susie__Chan Good luck, Susie. Be at one with the sand.  <VOLCANO>
@jamesradams @ogeerunner @TheGingerKenyan Is this much famed book not written by hand?
@J0ERUNS @UltraBevo Cheers, bud. Grand Slam's still a go. One race at a time though. Happy for TP100 to be the first one.
@J0ERUNS @UltraBevo Married in August. Puppy in November. Rome Marathon 2 weeks ago. And along the way, now expecting first bambino in July.
@UltraBevo @J0ERUNS That's right. I saw that on that other social media thingy. Stroke of genius!!
@UltraBevo If buying a paper proves to be too difficult, I'll see you in the autumn.
@J0ERUNS @UltraBevo And you, guys, been up to much in the last 8 months?
@J0ERUNS @UltraBevo I still plod occasionally. Convinced @MarkPatton82 to run his first 50 this weekend on the SDW.
@J0ERUNS @UltraBevo I am tweeting. That is all.
Ok but @J0ERUNS looks like you've finished a run and gone, "Wow!" and @UltraBevo looks like you haven't stopped since last May.
@UltraBevo @J0ERUNS I fear nothing...  <ATHLETIC SHOE>
@J0ERUNS @UltraBevo And you've all got spangly new running profile pics, it's as if lots of time has passed.
@UltraBevo Can you prove that?
@UltraDHC Nope, been fat. Isn't that the same thing?

@GrahamCarterGC Sadly, I'm gonna leave you hanging. Instead of entering the race, me &amp; the wife opted to get a puppy 
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC I'll be sure to ask the volunteers if #bryansgoneforapoo at every CP
@Susie__Chan It's @centurionrunner's seasonally rebranded W100
@imoutrunning It's @centurionrunner's seasonally rebranded W100
Last Friday morning, stood in the rain waiting for the dog to poop, then cycled, then ran ... does this count as a tri?
@UltraBevo Almost.
Delusions of grandeur conclude... #TP100, #SDW100, #NDW100 AND #A100. Looking forward to seeing you in 2015, @centurionrunner. #grandSlam

@PaulAskew_ Pish posh.
@naominf I've been out tonight. Pretty much £4 per drink minimum. Come back 1999, all is forgiven... £1.80 per pint.
@UltraRunnerDan Happy birthday, bud, good luck!!
@JediRider Sorry to hear that. Good luck with the cheese factory!!
“@ultrareluctant: 

Right, who's in?” @MarkPatton82
@martinbamford Hope it goes well, mate. I managed 2 miles by foot &amp; 19 miles by bike. Rewarded my efforts with pizza... #fail
@RaversRTW I'm good, ta. Clocked up 2 miles myself yesterday, hoping to feel mighty again myself soon. What's next for you?
@RaversRTW Missed that but much kudos. #getThisLadyAnIceBath
@UltraDHC Well done, bud. Where's me postcard?
@JediRider @Likeys Well done, bud, sounds like you enjoyed yourself.
@Susie__Chan @Rhalou Good luck, both. Have a grand time.
“@mia79gbr: @Gazz_Long I got an email from Brighton marathon offering entry for £72 earlier! £72?!” @BrightonMarathn £3 per mile? #getToFook
@martinbamford Currently rattling through seasons 5-7 of The West Wing on Amazon Instant Video. I'll return to SoA next. Thanks
@martinbamford Any good? Only up to speed up to the end of season 4 so far...


Are we taking on too much too soon? Seb seems to think so, as do I. How about you?
@naominf Best of luck!!
Why I didn't wear a helmet on BBC Breakfast 
@DDFPRYCE Kudos for finishing &amp; thanks for the write up, as there's only so much you can glean from Twitter as it's happening.
Dearest Twitter, thanks for your sympathy &amp; medical insight in equal measure.
@JediRider Remember that run I left for yesterday afternoon? 2.62 miles, twisted my ankle &amp; wasn't anywhere near able to catch it.
@ultrareluctant Thanks, appreciate the insight. Assumed if I could still walk, it wasn't broken &amp; everything would then just sort itself out
@ultrareluctant Ok... that was something that hadn't occurred to me.
@ultrareluctant I'll take that. So... foot's swollen and bruised. It's been submerged in ice water for an hour or so now. What next?
@UltraDHC It's stage one of going transgender. Tell Twitter you've twisted your ankle but you're one step of your way to becoming a woman...
@ogeerunner My last GP often uses Google when making a diagnosis. I thought I'd try Twitter... I'll up &amp; mobile again soon.
@ultrareluctant I thought you were a doctor?
@martinbamford I think the bruising's part of the healing. Stairs are easier than yesterday. I'm sure it'll be fine by next weekend.
@martinbamford Nah, bruising came up this afternoon. About 24 hrs after the highly traumatic incident.
@RaversRTW I can move it, put weight on it, etc. Guessing it's just a bad sprain.
@RaversRTW Heard something "snap" when I twisted it yesterday on a canal towpath. Painful but still works, guessing nothing's broken........
The saga continues... #malformedFoot #footgate 
@martinbamford Dunk it in the coldest water you can find. And quick.
@MarkPatton82 Well done, mate.
@UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC Tjanks, guys. I'm actually quite proud of the fact I can grate cheese with my feet. Yes, using a cheese grater...
Only about two and a half times the size that it normally is. 
@stupid_runner Gutted for you, mate. Hope you're niggle free soon.
@LeJOG_2016 Commiserations, mate. #liveToCluckAnotherDay
@MarkPatton82 Hobbling like a proper codger. Ankle looks like it's swallowed a ginormous golf ball.
@MarkPatton82 Bailed at Thrupp. We took a road trip to Banbury anyway. Almost sent you a pic of the hallowed ground that is Morrisons.
So much professional procrastination carried out in the services of not running recently... and this... Ach!! #pants
Ok, aborted the canal run after hearing my ankle snap when I twisted it. 2.62 miles in. #frustrating
Oxford to Banbury by canal? Tall ambition for an untrained lardy f**ker... #letsSeeHowThisGoes

.@sainsburys Worst breakfast ever. The beans at the top was just a solid lump. Recycling yesterday's leftovers? 
@GrahamCarterGC @martinbamford @centurionrunner And I thought Martin was being edgy...
Almost time to watch @centurionrunner's #PoS 2014 unfold. I should've offered to man that CP in Belgium...
@DDFPRYCE Good luck. Not planning to get yourself fitted with a GPS tracker for delivery to wherever in Europe you end up?
@stupid_runner Good luck, Sam. Hope you do well. I'm looking forward to finding out how long a piece of strong actually is...
@ultraperk @UltraBevo Bloke in my office ran Tooting this year. It's not exclusive and apparently very well organised 
@UltraBevo @hope24run in May, @run24uk in June, #TR24 in July, @SpitScramble24 in August, @equinox24run in September amongst others.
@naominf He does not look happy...
@jamesradams The typos gave the book an air of authenticity. You were so haggard after running for so long, you couldn't spell MacDonald's.
@jamesradams You mean I bought the iBooks copy for nothing? I could've remained stubborn &amp; held out for print... #pah!
@KolKurtz Do you no longer feel the burning need to moisturise?
1) Run with, but don't compare yourself to, others
2) Stay focu…
@imoutrunning Ditto.
@Judie_Judie Thanks. Small steps this morning, hoping to stretch my legs again tomorrow.  :-)
@naominf @seesteverun You wouldn't get injured during training if you forgot the training &amp; just ran events... #liveTheDream
@Judie_Judie Maybe I was too stubborn to know it.  :-p
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC @ogeerunner
1) Hahahahaha.
2) Brilliant.
3) When?
@imoutrunning Tell people you're training for ultra snorkelling...
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC @ogeerunner Ok, I give in... #HPUTBH?
@imoutrunning You could try breathing through a straw while you're out running..?
@imoutrunning You're supposed to breathe in &amp; out of a straw, which apparently (science forgotten) helps to prepare your lungs for altitude.
@imoutrunning Cheap? Never.........
@PaulJRadford Mentally prepare for a sadistic race &amp; hope your legs stay the course.  :-)
@Judie_Judie That's brilliant. So by being stubborn &amp; lazy, I'm just practising an ultra mindset for when the miles get tough.
@PaulJRadford Good luck to you. I'll be following the anarchy with great interest.
@Judie_Judie People are trying... Apparently I'm stubborn even when I'm in the middle of a slump.
@imoutrunning It could be gubbins. Just googled 'altitude training' again &amp; couldn't find it anywhere.
@naominf Dead jealous re. GUCR. If I threw that into the mix &amp; failed the slam, I'd be distraught. It's gonna have to wait another year.
@imoutrunning I tried breathing through a straw for a while, which was supposed to simulate altitude. Felt like a right spaz in the office.
@PaulJRadford Cheers, Paul. Recovered from W100 yet? All set for PoS?
@naominf Thanks, Naomi. Loved your #24in12 madness. Guess you've got a variety of distances lined up?
“@d10barker: I ran #sub3 at @dublinmarathon @RaversRTW” Massive kudos, chief. #enjoyTheGuinness
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC Nope, would love to run GUCR but actually want to finish something that I set out to. Next year's Grand Slam only.
@Judie_Judie @MattversusMatt @mikew30 Lining up for the Centurion Grand Slam next year. Big dreams. Unfocused present.
“@imoutrunning: @theMonkeySmokes according to a programme last night in the olden days they used to use cocaine and caffeine.” #motivation
@Judie_Judie @MattversusMatt Tried #runstreak a couple of times &amp; didn't find it motivating. Always bowled over by others though Cc @mikew30
#groundZero Almost cacked my pants today when logs in a field turned out to be increasingly curious cows... #headTorchOff #stealthRunning
#groundZero Hadn't run in 9 days but managed a princely 2.8 miles this morning. Any cures for motivational lethargy?
@d10barker Good luck, chief!!
@seesteverun Well done for the finish, mate. Some days rock, some don't but a finish is still a finish.
@seesteverun How'd you get on, Steve?
@LondonNici72 Have a good run!! #happyTrails
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning Nothing to add? #bryansgoneforapoo
@UltraRunnerDan Well done, bud.
@seesteverun Thanks, Steve. Ambition's one thing... Hoping my legs/mind will carry the rest of the way when needed.
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning True, I'm only entering the slam. Do you think I'll actually turn up at the start line ? #beaconsUltra #wifeSays
@UltraBevo Are you not along for the ride next year? Buckle no. 4?
Delusions of grandeur continue... #TP100, #SDW100 AND #NDW100. Looking forward to seeing you in 2015, @centurionrunner. #grandSlam
@UltraRunnerDan @BigPhil137 Seconded. Go forth &amp; spank the mileage. Enjoy yourself!!
@imoutrunning Also sounds like the more fun option. Tempo run, spin &amp; weights... Pah!!
@imoutrunning Longish run.
@UltraBevo Much kudos again, chief.
@jamie_woods @marathoneryri Good luck, mate.
@JOERUNSULTRAS @UltraDHC @imoutrunning Let's be fair about this, Gilbert could speak something that passed for English.
@UltraDHC @JOERUNSULTRAS @imoutrunning We almost had a repeat incident on the W100 ... twice!!
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC @JOERUNSULTRAS #dontEatTheJellyBabies
@UltraDHC @JOERUNSULTRAS @imoutrunning And you came back to help the other runners on the CP afterwards... #poo #legend
“@UltraDHC: @theMonkeySmokes @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS biggest regret of my life was not photo documenting that turd” #bryansgoneforapoo
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS Because you're not fun?
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS But you're my hero, Bryan. James Elson called you "fun Brian" last weekend, which made me chuckle.
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS ...they might've believed me.
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS Now if somebody else was performing CPR on the runner while you told them to stop being a 'fanny'...
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS Thank goodness there weren't any pictures.
@socks_up_to ...should be lots of fun, regardless of the weather.
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @JOERUNSULTRAS I'm not standing around at 3am &amp; keeping all of those details to myself. #soGraphic
@UltraDHC Well @imoutrunning and @JOERUNSULTRAS came blundering into the CP, "Where's Bryan?" What could I say?
@socks_up_to Thanks for those. The route does look a bit 'meh' in places but not as bad as I originally thought. Very open occasionally...
@LondonNici72 @UltraRunnerDan @Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraDHC All eyes are now firmly fixed on the unknown PoS line up... #UTMB!!
@UltraDHC @jamesradams @Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan Not even a book plug?
@jamesradams @Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC I expected THE James Adams (runner), got THE James Adams (author).  :-(
@ogeerunner @ultrareluctant @Susie__Chan @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC Is Traviss doing PoS?
@Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC @centurionrunner People have finished PoS both years. Yes, there have been finishers.
@Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC ...so is fair game for inclusion @centurionrunner's MEGA SLAM 2 x 50s, 4 x 100s + PoS
@Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC PoS should've been the exception. BUT it's no longer the same weekend as W100...
@Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC Didn't Traviss Wilcox run all six this year? Or are you including PoS?
@Susie__Chan @ultrareluctant @UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC You get to meet @jamesradams.
@socks_up_to @PurbeckMara262 Ran a stretch of the Jurassic Coast clockwise around that area back in March. Absolutely loved it.
@JOERUNSULTRAS @UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan @ultrareluctant Well, @UltraIan managed GUCR and LLC130 as well as the Grand Slam this year...
@socks_up_to And @PurbeckMara262 does sound like a lot of fun. Date wasn't good for me this year but 2015's hopeful.
@socks_up_to So plenty of flat, boring Tarmac? Well, you haven't unsold me but what I had imagined is now riddled full of holes.  :-(
@socks_up_to Ach! I'd imagined a nice &amp; winding coastal trail...
@GrahamCarterGC Obligatory unco-ordinated high five?
@GrahamCarterGC I think I'm going to. I need something to focus on before the year is out &amp; was sorry to have missed out on it last year.
@GrahamCarterGC @funkysimmm Thanks, guys
“@krispeterrun: Woke up this morning to find Strava on my phone was in the middle of a 74 hour run.” There's always a bigger fish!!
@LeJOG_2014 Sorry, mate, the only pic I have of you as your alter ego is with the leading lady.
@UltraDHC @UltraIan Bryan, have you got to Parkrun yet?
@UltraIan @UltraDHC @UltraIan @UltraDHC Ach! Had an absence of Twitter during August, how was LLC130?
@rodviggers @LeJOG_2014 I'm sure that next year @centurionrunner will delay the race 24 hrs for a spectacular bonfire display.
@UltraIan @UltraDHC You finished the GUCR, didn't you? Was there anything between SDW100 and NDW100?
Was @LikeTheWindMag inspired by Patrick Swayze?
@UltraDHC @stewartliesnham I can't do the Brecon weekend anymore &amp; I want something else before the year is out.
@UltraIan No worries, congratulations on finishing the slam!!
Portsmouth Coastal Marathon - any good? Road, trail, etc...

I AM SPARTA!!! LET'S DO THIS!!!
@JBLultra Centurion Running...

I like @centurionrunner weekends, whether I'm running, volunteering or spectating. My Twitter feed's always much more fun to read.

@Running_Bucky Yayyyy!!!!!
@JonFielden Well done, bud, much deserved kudos!!
@Susie__Chan Seriously @SpontaneousPlan was doing cartwheels of joy on his second time through Bury Downs... ;-)
@UltraBevo No worries, bud. Rest up &amp; savour the (sub 24 hr) buckle!!
@SpontaneousPlan @Susie__Chan Much kudos, mate. Awesome result. Good to say 'hello' &amp; glad to see you enjoying it both ways last night.
@DDFPRYCE @centurionrunner It's my goal for next year, although I suspect I won't be chasing any CRs...
@UltraBevo Well done, mate. Absolutely cracking job, I didn't doubt you for a second.
“@UltraBevo: Fuck. Yes. 
@Running_Bucky Good luck, mate.
That said, I'm still waiting to see @UltraBevo &amp; @SpontaneousPlan on the finishers' board. C'mon, guys!!!
#W100 Stopped by the finish line this year &amp; feel a small sense of closure of my own for the race.
#W100 Bury Downs all closed up for this year. Kudos to those who have finished &amp; good luck to those still out there.
@ogeerunner "You're a little cold, Mr Runner, why don't you take a space blanket and this heated girl and then be on your way..."
@ogeerunner That's what the runners said. I just figured that they were fatigued and delirious... #W100
Keep hearing stories of the holy Mecca that is Goring. Apparently they have heated toilets &amp; dancing girls... #W100

Good luck to @UltraBevo @SpontaneousPlan @UltraIan @Ashton378 @runaulait @PaulJRadford #W100
@runaulait They're designed to keep you entertained when you're fatigued and delirious.
@UltraBevo Good luck, bud, see you in Bury Downs!!
@rodviggers See you in Bury Downs.
#groundZero 6 miles this morning followed by porridge with apples &amp; manuka honey. #killTheFryUps
@Judie_Judie Thanks. Not been terribly mobile of late, hoping that turning that around should be enough to start a gradual shift.

#groundZero Weighed in at 13st 9lb this morning. About 1.5st heavier than I was at the beginning of August.

@UltraBevo Fresh? Yeh, right...

I'll bring the deodorant. #W100
@UltraBevo See you at Bury Downs!!
I ran today. I want points. I cycled too. Is that more points? I didn't swim. I'm not a triathlete. Does that count against me?
@stupid_runner "it's kind of like feeling impressed that I overtook my Dad" Genius. Well done again, mate.

@GrahamCarterGC I had that once... Woke up screaming for my life. Wife thought the house was being raided by a SWAT team.
@krispeterrun Serious tapering = serious running.
@funkysimmm 100 miles with a broom? Nah.........
@imoutrunning @LondonNici72 True, I do have a good constitution. Cc @UltraDHC
@UltraDHC Do you remember how you missed the post TP100 entry e-mail? Perhaps @LondonNici72's e-mails of love are in your junk folder...
@LondonNici72 @funkysimmm If only Twitter allowed you to ramble on at length like FB does... #dontForgetYourToothbrush
@imoutrunning @LondonNici72 Only volunteering this time. Winter 100.
An, an e-mail from @LondonNici72 last night. That's made my morning!!
 
@pyllon I thought there was a regional ballot. Very prestigious. Unlike these ultras where they'll take any old bugger.
@LondonNici72 I used to only notice the taste of an ash tray in the morning.... That's when you know she's not a keeper.  :-(
@littlerunnergal Congratulations!!
@LondonNici72 Have your way with her and then simply cast her aside...  :-)
@conwild Because you're all on your own... 
@pyllon It took you that long..? Ultras must be slowing you down. Have you thought about Parkrun? It may help with some tempo work...
I've finally got some competition then... 
Ok, watching a friend skate in a roller derby. Pure carnage, more fun than Wrestlemania.
@Susie__Chan @CastleTriathlon Good luck!!
@windsorAndy Um, bonus miles?
@Susie__Chan @Bluesman61_49 Why the time machine? You're allowed a wife now... If you went back to the 50s, you'd only have to wait 60 yrs.
@Susie__Chan @Bluesman61_49 You need to get yourself a wife, Susie, all the ironing gets done for you.
@stupid_runner @UltraRunnerDan Seconded. Congratulations, Sam, much kudos!!
@Bluesman61_49 @Susie__Chan She does the dishes? Good lass. Now, get onto that pile of crumpled shirts, will ya?
@UltraBevo Grand Slam attempt #2 next year. Feeling better about the idea of it. But yep, see you in Winchester.
Well, 2015 now has two races lined up.
#TP100 and #SDW100. Obviously suffering delusions of grandeur again!!
@ultraperk Well, I wouldn't have been completely surprised seeing how much the CR fell by this year on SDW100.  :-)
“@ultraperk: 153 miles in 22hrs 30mins. Not bad I suppose.” Holy f**k!! Well done, mate!! And yes, I did double take when I saw your tweet.
@stupid_runner Good luck, bud. Give my regards to Leonidas.
@ultraperk Well done, bud. This just means you can't be sh*t now. Happy trails!!
@UltraDHC Still signed up. That's about the size of it at the minute.
@LondonNici72 I'm tempted to be impressed. Now by the light of head torch, are you juggling on a unicycle in bed?
@LondonNici72 Is the head torch actually on or are you laying in bed wearing it?
@ninjarunr On Monday, I managed a 5K and a reheated roast. Good times indeed.
@cooker44 There was plenty of time. I took all the time in the world. It was probably less than an hour.
I ran over 5K at lunch today. I even built up a sweat. I am now waiting for plaudits &amp; accolades to start rolling in.
@run24uk Can't be helped. Massively enjoyed 2014, hope to be back in 2016.
@seesteverun Happy anniversary! Any special plans?
Still running inadequately.
Nothing more to report at this time.
As you were.
Oh @run24uk, I've now been sent a priority link for next year. Because you've brought the event forward, I'm sadly already booked up #SDW100
@LondonNici72 Good luck, Nici, keep going!!
@jamie_woods @blurofficial Letting the PC play through the whole library. Heard Leisure, Modern Life and Parklife today. 13's up next.
Listening to #Blur's #ModernLifeIsRubbish. Almost sorry I never gave it greater time if day when I was younger. Brilliant album.
@suttonelc Butlin's?
@PaulJRadford Checked the results for the Ridgeway Ultra to see how a mate from work got on... You had a good day at the office, didn't you?
Bowled over by @davegromitcox's effort on @T184Race this weekend. Formidable! Relentless machine! Finished 6th &amp; 7th with James Allan.
Popped down to the Thames in Abingdon, as you do on a Saturday night, to cheer on @davegromitcox &amp; James Allan. Chirpy buggers.  :-)  #T184
@martinbamford Well done, sir.
@jamie_woods Commiserations, bud. Still a bloody long way. Hope you're feet are less battered soon.
@UltraAvon Mate, bloody good effort - no need to apologise. You were top 5 for, like, forever. Rest up and recover soon.
@T184Race Osney Island?
Three day weekend? Thinking about running. Also thinking about breakfast.
In essence, what is there?
Cat fighting in Toronto. #worldsOnlyHope 
.@nikosl3 I'VE FOUND IT!!! The #StickyWicket is on #VancouverIsland!!! 
#loveTofino
I've almost missed you but I've still another week of not running, drinking &amp; indulging my every whim to stumble through. #VancouverIsland
Saw this out in Qualicum Falls, reminded me of Box Hill. Good luck to those running @centurionrunner's #NDW100. 
@a1exh Thanks, Alex
@Team_Kenzi Hey, hope you're ok and sorry for the late reply. Thank you SO MUCH for the card &amp; the tweet. En route to the church now...  :-)
Yup. Day's been good. All set to tie the knot in 40 hrs.

Um, didn't manage to run today... #pants
@Running_Bucky I found that and then cursed out loud when the sequel was nowhere to be found!!
@UltraAvon Proper ballache.
@FromSofaToUltra Good luck, mate. Go forth &amp; smash it. #neverStop
9 miles to start the day. Happy days indeed. Every day should start with a run and then no work.
@jameselsons Fascinating read, 1st attempt also. It's like you're Captain Ahab &amp; the #BGR is now Moby Dick.
@UltraBevo Mate, just enjoy what you do
@seesteverun @UltraDHC @centurionrunner Volunteering on #TP100 was the most fun I've had without running.  :-)
@UltraDHC @centurionrunner Yep, all signed up. Sent you the e-mail.
@UltraDHC @centurionrunner E-mail went out 2-3 weeks back.
@BenjiiMcKnight ...home, I'm hibernating until Oxford becomes a sensible place to live &amp; work again.
@BenjiiMcKnight Sounds horrific. Drove around the contraflow last night, which was busy for a Sunday evening. If I have trouble getting...
@BenjiiMcKnight Abandon Oxford?
@TeamB_O_B If the water's ice cold, you won't feel the chafing....... #lies
@TeamB_O_B I like that feeling. Every wince if pain is a reminder of how awesome the weekend was.
@UltraRunnerDan Congratulations, mate!! Looking good.
@MarkPatton82 After the wedding? You seriously think I'm that patient...?
@MarkPatton82 Now that you have a car, which 24 hr race are we entering next?
@MarkPatton82 Blacow's on here but he doesn't follow me. Not seen anyone else. Good luck with the interview.
@UltraDHC Well done, mate.
@MarkPatton82 What did you get? There I was, telling my old man earlier this very evening, that you could drive but had yet to buy a car...
@ogeerunner Congratulations!!
@TeamB_O_B You're in your 20s? Clearly this man has run too far &amp; is now delusional. Quick, sign him up for the next one.
@TeamB_O_B Well done, bud. Awesome effort.
Little bit sad that they're gone but I won't miss seeing them for mile &amp; mile upon end running along the Thames. 
@TeamB_O_B C'mon!!
"Just one more round, ya bum"
#RockyMotivationalQuotes
@TeamB_O_B Are his balls sore? #TR24
This morning's plus point, discovered two new bridleways with countless footpaths spurring off of the second one. #timeToExplore
Called it a day to either run later or tomorrow but seriously ankle, why wait until 10K to say enough's enough? #frustrating
Planned leisurely 12-15 miles this morning. Twisted my ankle after 1 &amp; had to walk it off. Fine until 6 miles &amp; lots more pain. What gives?
@JonLavis @jamie_woods Seconded. Good luck, mate.
Good luck peeps running #TR24, solo or team, this year inc. @windsorAndy @mia79gbr @littlerunnergal + #teamCrazy @mikew30 @Spin_Queen1
Good luck to @TeamB_O_B, who's obviously read Roald Dahl's biography and will be #goingSolo at this year's #TR24 #100orBust #commandoRoll
@ogeerunner @imoutrunning @runningtowork @UltraDHC @TheLakeland100 Guessing you 100 mile runners are already underway. #lateTweet
Good luck to @ogeerunner @imoutrunning @runningtowork @UltraDHC running 100 &amp; 50 milers at @TheLakeland100 this weekend.
No running today. Ate everything that was going out of date + a whole coffee cake &amp; helped to make NINE dough larvae 
@bfp2030 @funkysimmm My boss that. Apparently it can take 6 months to take hold &amp; 6 months to loosen up. Sounds unpleasant.
@jamie_woods @jamie_woods Just got home from the JR myself. Brother's wife had their 1st child yesterday.  :-)  Hope your father-in-law's ok
@jamie_woods What are you there for?
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 Mrs always lances any trouble spots. Up &amp; running again minutes with no discomfort.  :-)
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 Time for a long needle &amp; thread.......
@runningtowork Good luck, sir!!
“@findarace: Event: Brecon to Cardiff #Ultra. A one-way 42 mile run along the picturesque Taff Trail 
@UltraRunnerDan @UltraBevo @UltraDHC Hair and make up? A childhood raises on the stage?
@UltraDHC @UltraBevo Ultra winning beard? There's gotta be enough beard for that?
@UltraBevo @UltraDHC Surely, oh my f**king Christ!!
@UltraBevo @UltraDHC I only have stubble which is why I'm limited to 5Ks.

:'-(
@Gooseteeth Well... 
Cooked breakfasts are what make Tuesday special.
@naominf Thanks. I think I'd meant to be 1.5 st lighter for my wedding in12 days. Figured a few extra miles couldn't hurts.  :-)
So 2 miles before work, another 4 at lunch &amp; finishing with 7 this evening across overgrown non-existent footpaths. Legs are cut to shreds.
@carl_ara @NightUltra12 Yep, you're properly boned, seeing as it's tomorrow... Wait, it's not until August &amp; you still have time?! #winnng


@JonLavis Kudos, mate!
@SpontaneousPlan Where were you running today? You've had a year of strong results so far - one too many?
@UltraBevo Procrastinate, do not. Go outside &amp; chase away the fuzziness. #runYouFool
@Coxwolds Read that as 'cackles &amp; mild anxiety'. Imagined someone cackling to themselves sporadically in the corner of a corner shop.
@becktacular We did in Yarnton. Less than the night before but still plenty of flashes illuminating the night sky.
@stupid_runner Sounds like a South Park episode.  :-)
@Team_Kenzi That's a bugger. How long are you back for? Anything exciting lined up for while you're here?
@Team_Kenzi With husband in tow?
@RugbyUppers In the heat, opted for a cheap vest. #blamingTheGear
@Team_Kenzi Many happy returns. May you return for many more happy years. That's how returns work, they come back again &amp; again &amp; again.
@imoutrunning @JediRider @carl_ara Prepubescent hobbit.
@UltraBevo The latter. Watch Ferngully instead, which is the same film but doesn't make your own eyes burn themselves from the inside out.
Sore and chafed nipples.

That is all.
And another 8 miles in the bank ... thank you, Friday. Sweating expected to cease at 2am local time.
@JOERUNSULTRAS Where's Jack Bauer when you need him?
@imoutrunning @JediRider @carl_ara Sounds about right, do you have hairy feet?
Ran a 10K three hours ago. Only just stopped sweating. Even tried a 30 min cold shower. English heat wave = poor man's Badwater training.
@imoutrunning @JediRider @carl_ara Is that because you're a Hobbit?
@MarkPatton82 Maybe. Jemima's late in London tomorrow. Could happen.
@MarkPatton82 Go for a run. #runningTweet
@Jenny_Hitch We had 8 down to 6 at Endure24 and three of us did 75% of the 28 laps. Had such a good time though. Good luck!!
@martinbamford @InformedChoice Ah, ok, that makes a little more sense. Happy birthday for both anniversaries.
@martinbamford You're 20?! Wow!!
@suttonelc Hope you get a considered diagnosis soon.
@LapChallenge Well done, mate!! Sounded like fun.
“@iRunFar: @kilianj Kilian Jornet "It feels good to sit down." #HR100 
@carl_ara @imoutrunning Acquiesce?
Ok, now I'm awake, the #Hardrock100 updates aren't coming quick enough. Where's the live video feed?
.@runnersworlduk Plenty of slimming &amp; weight loss. Can't wait.
@TeamB_O_B @iRunFar It doesn't pay to bet against him.
@mia79gbr Yes, it's called a Manhattan.
Had Mp3s on shuffle all day. Cue Joy Division. No more shuffling. Thank you, please.
@JOERUNSULTRAS @JediRider @hardrock100 Just perusing this... 
@JOERUNSULTRAS @JediRider @hardrock100 Bowled over @timmyolson_run's #WS100 CR in 2012. I'd wager on him or @kilianj.

@NightUltra12 @imoutrunning @starterfour10 @carl_ara Tempted to sign up before I saw the flyers at Endure but I'm on my honeymoon.
@imoutrunning @starterfour10 @carl_ara @NightUltra12 Think he is or he's taken a backhander for promo duties...
@carl_ara @starterfour10 @imoutrunning Apologies, you almost appeared to be sane.
@starterfour10 @imoutrunning Why has @carl_ara not followed you into madness yet?
@craig_secure @imoutrunning @starterfour10 Fruit was a godsend in the heat on this year's NDW50. Food which also quenched the thirst.
@JediRider @imoutrunning @starterfour10 If I'm starting to flag, coke's good for a pick-me-up. Easier to drink on the fly than hot coffee.
@imoutrunning @starterfour10 That's what I started with, but after 50 miles, sugar gave me stomach cramps. Switched to savoury &amp; on I "ran".
@starterfour10 Learned less sugar on my 1st 100 miler. Slowly learning that savoury, little &amp; often, keeps the engine fuelled &amp; mind awake.
What not to expect: vitamin advice
What to expect: naughty carbs

@LapChallenge I've been tested. Apparently, I'm only partially insane. So I'll pass on the double.
Ok, now I really want to run Badwater...
@TeamB_O_B Damn good shout.  :-)
@GrahamCarterGC Damn you, Lance Armstrong.
@TeamB_O_B Ta, I'll take a look
@TeamB_O_B What else have you got, other than Unbreakable?
“@seesteverun: Is it just me, or is less and less of @runnersworlduk actually about running?” Buy @TrailRunningMag
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC Farley's Rusks and lemon squash. Supposed to be for the older, slower peeps. Their teeth are only good for Rusks.
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC The Parkrun in Abingdon has an aid station at the 2K sign.
@imoutrunning What's on for next year?
@imoutrunning You're starting to sound like it's tomorrow... Of course, you're ready, aren't you? Isn't Lakeland like Parkrun to you?  ;-)
@imoutrunning Well, you do keep running the bucket list ultras...
@imoutrunning That's ages away, you'll have time to enter loads more races before that.
@AliJYoung Hokas with fairy lights? That works in Ibiza, doesn't it?

@RunKeeper Ok, how much cr*p do I have to skip since last iOS update? Maybe it's time to sign up with @Strava...
@imoutrunning Ultra tourism?
Isn't that what #TdG is?
Saw someone post this the other day... Something to work through.

Sat down with the @bbcstoryville Lance Armstrong documentary this afternoon. Most upset about how he's ruined #Dodgeball for me.
“@TeamB_O_B: Found a local Chinese, it's called Mings.

This makes me smile.

Mrs is in London for the evening &amp; I'm listening to the take away menus...
@GrahamCarterGC Did you ask for thoughts? Did that tweet disappear?
@GrahamCarterGC @run24uk Well done, mate. I miss last weekend and that's after an adventuresome day out in London today. Loved #Endure24.
Finished some book by @jamesradams. I'm as sad that it's over as I am at the end of an ultra. May have to run again before sequel's written.
@ThreeUKSupport No signal in Yarnton, Oxon again. Well, that's handy that I' paying you for coverage, isn't it?! #pants

@socks_up_to @RaversRTW @runnersworlduk Perhaps Slimmer's World is a magazine about running? #topsyTurvy
Time for the #Endure24 lemon drizzle muffin to go the way of the dodo. @run24uk 

Write up of last weekends Endure 24 event. Warning, may contain moaning
@girlyrunner1 Yes, it is. Now go home and enjoy your complimentary five day weekend...
@girlyrunner1 Surely that's "How is it only just Wednesday? This week really needs to hurry up. Stat." All happens faster when you say stat.
@jamesradams Does Abraham Lincoln count? I heard he hunted vampires, which is why we are all free from enslavement today.

@TheRamblingDuck @run24uk @GrahamCarterGC There was a six day track event at Radley College in Oxon last year... Maybe one day?
@UltraDHC Perhaps you should ask the wife?
@run24uk @TheRamblingDuck @GrahamCarterGC If you won't stage a 48hr event, what choice do I have? Stopped short of putting mud on the carpet
@TheRamblingDuck @run24uk @GrahamCarterGC I've been making excuses to go up &amp; down the stairs, legs feel enjoyably achy.  :-)
@BigPhil137 @GrahamCarterGC @run24uk It's on the cards but I'm also thinking about breaking old habits &amp; trying anything new.
@BigPhil137 @GrahamCarterGC @run24uk Phil, what've you got to fret about? You've finished 50 &amp; 80 milers with 11 months to go until #SDW100!
@GrahamCarterGC @run24uk I'm having withdrawal symptoms. Pangs to just out be running anywhere, anytime. When can I give up the day job?
@MattversusMatt Good luck with those. Run the Trot twice, it's good fun so long as the Thames hasn't broken its banks.
@MattversusMatt What do you have lined up in October? And 2015?
@GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 @run24uk Just remember that you've chalked up 80 miles &amp; to keep going forward, regardless of the pace.
@GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 @run24uk You'll crush that time next year. 80 miles in mud? 100 across the Downs'll be fine.
@GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 @run24uk Maybe. Took me long enough (29 hrs 37 mins) to get that last time!!!  ;-)
@MattversusMatt Well played, chief. I was taking it easy on a team of six, we clocked 28 laps. 1st ultra done, when's the 2nd?
@MattversusMatt No probs, mate. Sorry for the copyright abuse. How did you get on in the mudfest that was?
Ok, I need another 24hr fix... @hope24run's May, @run24uk's Jun, #TR24's Jul, @SpitScramble24's Aug, @equinox24run's Sep. What am I missing?
Apologies to @MattversusMatt.
Pic on the tweet below is his.
Not stolen intentionally or with malice. 
@GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 Very happy for you both, sounds like a good strategy (...which I may very well plagiarise when I go solo).
#teamPhnar @MarkPatton82 @JoelyMay83 triumphant at @run24uk's #Endure24!! Clocked 28 laps in 24 hrs 27 mins 39 secs. 
@SpontaneousPlan @starterfour10 ...run some new/interesting stuff @ManVHorse. Once I've done the Slam, I won't feel the need to do it again.
@SpontaneousPlan @starterfour10 Got my eyes on the Grand Slam next year... annoyingly, it's either chalk that off my list or...
@starterfour10 @SpontaneousPlan Sorry, guys, saw @centurionrunner correct it on Twitter &amp; @LondonNici72 on FB, SDW100 is on 13th/14th June.
@SpitScramble24 I sent your event to @MarkPatton82 on my team before #Endure24. Apparently I'm supposed to wait until #Endure24 was over...
@GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 How did you guys get on? Did everything, weather aside, go according to plan - pace, breaks, etc?
@JediRider @wser100 What's the worst that could happen? #youGetIn
@UltraDHC I lay claim to two thirds of the bad odours &amp; mess in the toilets on site.
@UltraDHC Do you actually want the sob story? My guts were wreaking havoc, I wasn't retaining any fluids &amp; I ended up doing 10 laps.
#Endure24 sprint finish.
Obviously, there wasn't enough mud out there... Cc @run24uk 
@LondonNici72 Isn't ultra marathon code for 50 mile ramble with picnic/cake stops?
@LondonNici72 @jamie_woods 65 slowwwww miles?! Cursing the mud as you went.....  ;-)  Well done, hope you're not too achy today.
@Judie_Judie As a protective layer, it must be. Only just managed to scrub the last of it off!!
@carl_ara @run24uk It was pretty spectacular, especially freewheelin' some of the descents!!
@Judie_Judie @TeamB_O_B @MarkPatton82 @MattversusMatt #Endure24 2014 was loops of a 5 mile bog, which was rather chaotically fun.
@windsorAndy @TeamB_O_B was also using this as prep for #TR24. Sadly, the dates for TR24 aren't good for me this year.
@LondonNici72 @jamie_woods Honestly, no offence taken. Well done for the solo effort, how did you get on in the end?
@d10barker @TeamB_O_B @MarkPatton82 We chalked up 28 laps in the end, which was our loose target for a dry course. Very happy indeed.

@UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC @ogeerunner @run24uk I thought the idea was to do as much or as little as you wanted in 24 hrs?

4 laps done today. Heading out shortly for another 4 stint. If anyone omnipotent's listening on Twitter, tell the rain to do one. @run24uk
@TheRamblingDuck Hope you're having fun out there. I'm the person who keeps on randomly going "Rambling Duck?"
@Claire_Hobson @run24uk Good luck!! I'll vouch for the English breakfast on site. #Endure24
@Running_Bucky Like @run24uk? #Endure24
@carl_ara Yeh, I'd heard that too. Utter madness. Why would anyone chose a nice, comfy bed over a sleeping bag &amp; a ground mat?
#Endure24 @run24uk I will soon be passing into slumber. Whatever you throw at us tomorrow, we won't stop &amp; my troops'll see out the finish!
@carl_ara The calm before the storm. I was expecting more noise from tents tonight but no, people seem civilised. 13 hrs &amp; counting...
@carl_ara Kick off is midday. I'm on for a double to start. #goodTimes #whoDrewTheShortStraw?

@KevRunTheHill Running + camping? What could be better?  :-)
@KevRunTheHill Different levels of experience, mate, some doing more than others but it should all be good fun.
@carl_ara Couple of tricky points but the rest should remain quite runnable. It's very nice, like Parkrun with added adventure.
@carl_ara Really nice. Good trail. Decent underfoot. Occasional puddle but very promising.  :-)
#Endure24 Drive done. Camp set up. Work taken care of. Course recce done. #shattered #wheresTheFood?
@UltraRunnerDan Thanks, Dan
@KevRunTheHill Just the six of us. It was supposed to be eight but we had a couple of drop outs.
@seesteverun Hopefully, saved for later.
@TeamB_O_B @carl_ara @MattDunnRun @MarkPatton82 @Running_Bucky @UltraAvon My team are just wearing last year's #TR24 shirts.
@MarkPatton82 @TeamB_O_B was kicking around #TR24 last year &amp; starts each lap with a commando roll!! #Endure24
@MarkPatton82 Also team runners... @carl_ara @Running_Bucky @UltraAvon @MattDunnRun @TeamB_O_B #Endure24
@MarkPatton82 I would recommend following @UltraRunnerDan @GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 @KevRunTheHill All going solo this weekend. #Endure24
@LondonNici72 @UltraAvon Sombrero?
@UltraRunnerDan @run24uk I did. @PaulAlisHat is gonna be there.
@UltraAvon @LondonNici72 Isn't your hat already there?
Is it @run24uk #Endure24, @wser100 #WS100 and @TheLakeland100 #UTLD this weekend?
#teamPhnar is alive on Twitter. @MarkPatton82 has succumbed to the dark side.
@starterfour10 @stewartliesnham Nope, June.  :-)  :-)
I'm sorry, is work still going on? Is it not time to set up camp  for #Endure24 yet?
@UltraDHC Haven't they stopped? Thought they'd gone quiet since May last year.
@stewartliesnham @centurionrunner Almost asked the same thing, just assumed they want to up the ante on those attempting the Grand Slam.
@TheGingerKenyan #runtilyoupuke?
Sat on the toilet this morning, taking my daily constitutional, just wondering how @jamesradams managed to do that AND run! #runningAndStuff
@MattDunnRun Do it, mate. I'm running in a team. We're pitching up on Friday morning. But yeah, give me a shout when you're on site.
Working week almost over. #Endure24 prep underway. Troops are being rallied. Time to... #ZzzZzzZzz
@seesteverun Yeh, don't worry about it. Staying in your head won't help things. Just run to feel and enjoy what you're doing.
“@UltraDHC: Got called an ‘arsehole’ by a van driver. So now I am a proper cyclist.” #properWanker
@JediRider @UltraRunnerDan @KevRunTheHill @GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 See, Dan? Tim hasn't forgotten us...

(thanks, btw)
@GrahamCarterGC @KevRunTheHill @BigPhil137 @UltraRunnerDan We're old news, Dan...
Do you want to further mankind? What would you do for THE FLYING CAR?

@GrahamCarterGC @TeamB_O_B'a easy to spot. He'll be the one starting each lap with a commando roll!!
@UltraBevo Learning to deal with the fallout is as much of an exercise as dealing with the second 50 miles in a 100 miler. All in the mind.
@UltraBevo Good luck finding your rhythm again. Ultras can provide exhilarating highs &amp; crushing lows.
@UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC @readinghalf @oxfordhalf @bathhalf

£45!!!

* cough * splutter * cough *
@ninjarunr @giaac I wouldn't mind the half and the ultra's definitely on my 'to do' list... Where's me calendar?
Does stretching ever help? 
@readinghalf @oxfordhalf @bathhalf @giaac @ninjarunr #LessMoneyPerMile
@ninjarunr @readinghalf @oxfordhalf @bathhalf @giaac Ta, bit further afield but it's good to know that not everybody's out to rip you off.
Time to unfollow @readinghalf @oxfordhalf @bathhalf. This "Vitality" branding reeks &amp; all of the half marathons are over-priced.
Kudos to @readinghalf - they're pimping next year's event with a new site. The course remains the same but they're still waiting for a map?
@run24uk Re. last e-mail that was sent, are we able to arrive before Fri 10am? Sorry, wasn't sure if you meant registration on Sat.
@toks Still got moving this morning, which is more than I did.  :-)
@ultra_ewan Sorry, mate, I'm knackered. That's purely favourited for me to forget to read later.....
@UltraBevo @TheGingerKenyan still pines for @ultrabritton, his (former?) coach. I think there's merit but haven't stumped up the cash yet.
@starterfour10 @ManVHorse @wholeearthfoods Sounds more of a level playing field than I was expecting.
@UltraRunnerDan Good luck, mate, see you at the weekend.
Is is time for @run24uk yet? In an office and very bored...
@jamesradams It is better than Lord of the Rings. That quickly became campfire fodder and I don't want to burn my iPad.
@jamesradams Still haven't finished it. It's the first ebook I've started &amp; I can't get the hang of turning the pages.
@Manonthefence Was this a race this morning? Whereabouts?
@MattDunnRun Well done, Matt. Sounds like you had a good time.
@LapChallenge It's on my bucket list!!
@LapChallenge Last tweet 09/05/2013. Haven't heard anyone mention them for eons, so unless they're operating without social media...?
@LapChallenge Whatever happened to Endurance Life?
@Team_Kenzi But I was a little underwhelmed. Price you pay for weekly viewing instead of a box set all at once.  ;-)  What did you think?
@Team_Kenzi I think we're only a day behind the US on the big series so last Monday. I was mostly happy with the finale.
@carl_ara Likewise. We have a loose target but we'll be happy to be running for 24hr. Camping AND running? Well, why wouldn't you.....
@GrahamCarterGC Every lap?  ;-)
@carl_ara @GrahamCarterGC @UltraDHC Team or solo?
@UltraDHC @GrahamCarterGC Endure24's a leisurely weekend away for me, with some running thrown in for good measure. Solo? Nah, not this year
@GrahamCarterGC @UltraDHC @run24uk Team of 6-7, hoping for 29 laps or more.
@pyllon Wowsers!!!
@GrahamCarterGC @run24uk 18.5 miles this morning &amp; feeling good. Can. Not. Wait. For next weekend!!!
“@ukrunrambles: Robbie Britton (@ultrabritton) 2nd @WHWRace in 14:47. 20mins inside old CR too. #WHWRace” Well done, Robbie!!
“@ogeerunner: 14hrs 20mins for @pyllon in this years #WHWrace. That is just insanely fast. What an athlete.” Seconded &amp; congratulations!!!
@jamie_woods @T184Race I would've gone with shoes but each to their own...
@ultra_paulo @TrailWales Kudos.
@ootboxford Awesome show last night. 3rd year in a row, definitely coming back for a 4th.
“@Coxwolds: At #whwrace @ultrabritton trailing lead by 15 mins. He's a lethal tactician and a machine. He ain't out.” #passTheFruitPastilles
@ultraperk I see what you're doing, waiting for @ultrabritton to break a course record before you have a pop next year &amp; smash it some more.
@conwild Drink more often.  :-)
@UltraDHC @GrahamCarterGC @UltraRunnerDan @BigPhil137 So... Peppa Pig this weekend, Endure24 next weekend?
@UltraRunnerDan @GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 All set for @run24uk? Are we expecting anyone else along? When are you guys arriving?
@UltraDHC @stupid_runner @ultraperk @TheGingerKenyan 33 and not much hope.
Obligatory tweet. No running today. Not fussed about the World Cup. Mowed a lawn. Enjoyed an amazing risotto. That's all. Are you bored yet?
@centurionrunner Were you quick enough to take any pictures of @ultraperk? #SDW100
@Stu_Hurd Hey boy, is Shells having any issues with Three at the minute? No signal out here in the styx....
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I would call &amp; escalate the issue but guess what? NO SIGNAL!!!
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport What's going on with signal around Oxfordshire?? Nothing or very patchy for two days now!!!
@chad_valley Oxford?
@BikeRunSwimUK @Brutaleventsuk Onesie for the ONER?
@FromSofaToUltra @ultraperk Cracking read &amp; he's such a polite &amp; humble winner. 14 hrs? Un-be-liev-a-ble!!!
.@FromSofaToUltra: An interview with @ultraperk after his 14:03 demolition of the South Downs Way 100 at the weekend: 

My thoughts on the dreaded? DNF
@ultrareluctant He sniffs the snow. It's a qualification that he needs to attain in order to become a referee. #worldCupProblems
@ultrareluctant 4, one for every side of the pitch. Unless the grass is green, in which case, bonus points are awarded if it's snowing.
@jamie_woods “@BBCBreaking: F1 legend Michael Schumacher has left hospital &amp; is no longer in a coma, his family says 
@ultraperk Seriously, gobsmacked. Well done, mate.
@TheGingerKenyan Just saw you at @Transvulcania, how did you manage not to chloroform @KillianJornet? #ultraLove
@ultraperk Mate, it just occurred to me today that you ran faster than my best marathon time, four times over - you impressive b*stard!!!
Still running the #SDW100? Keep going!!
@UltraAvon Machine. Those are pretty impressive finishes this year... #TP100 #GUCR #SDW100 Well done, bud.
@Ashton378 Well done, chief. Not your fastest, no, but still a cracking result.
@d10barker @beksrand @Marvellousmimi @RaversRTW Well done, mate. That's a result &amp; a half!!
“@centurionrunner: Winner of the 2014 Petzl South Downs Way 100 is Mark Perkins @ultraperk in 14 hrs 3 mins and 54 secs” #awesome
@UltraBevo It happens, bud. Started the NDW100 in 2012, my legs felt like they'd already done 50 miles. Look after yourself &amp; recover strong
“@centurionrunner: Mark Perkins @ultraperk through mile 83.6 at 17:33pm .... 11hrs and 33mins!!! #SDW100”
@UltraBevo Mate, I'm sorry to hear that.
“@LondonNici72: Mark Perkins @ultraperk through mile 69.8 in 9 hours and 28 mins!!!!  I have no words! #SDW100”
“@centurionrunner: Mark Perkins @ultraperk 7:08 to Washington mile 54. Looking good and under @ultrabritton splits by 44 mins!!!!”
@RaversRTW Maybe both.  :-)
@RaversRTW Happy crewing!! And good luck with the pacing!!
Got a mate's wedding in Cornwall tomorrow. Little gutted to not be running #SDW100 again this year, already dreaming of 2015.
@ultra_ewan @UltraDHC Let me guess, it's because @TheGingerKenyan withdrew &amp; there was no trophy to smash. #SDW100
@UltraDHC @ultra_ewan Well, his name was on the list.  :-?
Good luck to all runners, crews, volunteers, organisers, spectators &amp; anyone I've missed at this year's @centurionrunner #SDW100
Good luck to those running this year's #SDW100 @suziealbiston @cow_phobic @Norsemouse
Good luck to those running this year's #SDW100 @stewartliesnham @sw_mackenzie @gems_carter @Ashton378 @UltraIan @philly_80
Good luck to those running this year's #SDW100 @mjgreenfield1 @ultraperk @ultra_ewan @d10barker @UltraAvon @JediRider @UltraBevo
@ogeerunner Keep the beard. All the legendary ultra runners run with beards!! Wha'd'ya mean it might not be true?! Keep the beard!!!
@BigPhil137 I'm looking forward to enjoying a leisurely weekend of running. Course looks good, eh?
@GrahamCarterGC @funkysimmm I'm more concerned about the fact you're holding a book about a cyclist. I mean, call yourself a runner...  ;-)
Running #Endure24 @run24uk? Like a course preview? 
@windsorAndy Hahaha, My Mrs drew them as well. "Are they any good?" She said. Well, if you need to ask...
@ITVSport “@UltraDHC: There should be a button in the remote you press and it pixelates out Adrian Chiles’ stupid face.”
@ITVSport “@BigPhil137: And Mute. Halftime with Adrian Chiles :)” Seriously, he isn't good enough to advertise washing powder.
@d10barker Remember this little exercise from NDW100 a couple of years ago. Still as impressive.
@GrahamCarterGC That's apparently supposed to help running form. There's some guy in the US who only runs backwards.  :-)
@Coxwolds LOL from both me &amp; the Mrs
@GrahamCarterGC Whoa there, fella! You could be opening Pandora's Box?!
@GrahamCarterGC This morning, it was still left foot, right foot and repeat.
@BenjiiMcKnight Be grateful, my Mrs got Honduras.


@JediRider I normally get my hair cut before a race, because it means I'll have less to carry.
Tried a spin class today. First time on anything resembling a bike in a couple of months. Yeh, that hurt. Going back next week for more.
@UltraBevo Good luck, mate. When it gets sark, just remember you've done it before and keep moving forward.
@mish106 “@Home_Halfway: Guys, I'm here to answer all of your questions. 

@UltraDHC Totally. Heard it on the radio driving home. Sad news. RIP.

We've created a one day 'intro' ultra distance... 
31st January-1st February 2015, Farnham, Surrey
66 miles, 2 days.... 
@UltraIan Dear me, chief. Feeling like GUCR was only yesterday &amp; didn't even run it, almost tempted to label you as certifiable. Good luck!!
@stupid_runner Too hilly after 145 miles of canal? All recovered after GUCR?
@mish106 You could try calling them?! They're probably worth keeping if they pick up.
@mish106 Spend way more time on here than FB. Only fair to RT.  :-)  Other people need to laugh. Very easy for the feed to become too large.
@mish106 So how are you finding your reintegration back into Twitter?
@GeorgeKnights I'm sure you'll be fine, mate. I was tempted to throw my lot in for #LLC30 but I'll save my first canal affair for #GUCR.
@GeorgeKnights Oh dear... here we go... Cue 'Here I Go Again' by Whitesnake.
@TheGingerKenyan ...and your tales of self-destruction &amp; mutilated feet &amp; pain remind me that I can still push harder &amp; ask more of myself.
@TheGingerKenyan Rich, I wanna say you're my hero but you're way too ginger. But seriously, I'm inspired. I need to keep pushing myself...
"That man makes me amorous. Let's get our cancelled balloon sex on the go."
@naominf Wow!
@mish106 Good luck, mate......
@J0ERUNS Enjoyed SDW50 last year. Ran NDW50 this year. NDW felt like I'd actually been tested. Both wonderful trails though.
@J0ERUNS SDW100 for a nice rollin' 100 miler, NDW100 if you wanted a beasting.
@TheGingerKenyan Do Kenyans swim?
@naominf Good luck this morning.
@girlyrunner1 Have you woken up in 1998?
@seesteverun This sounds like a very strange euphemism...
@UltraBevo Day off. Planned to run. Embraced the fairweather runner within and settled for cake &amp; Alpha Papa instead.
@UltraBevo Cheers, mate. Happy birthday to you. Remember, cake counts as carb loading for a 100 miler too.

Blogs are so noughties, part of my 'what a feckin eejit series'
@J0ERUNS I try to eat local honey, which is supposed to help you acclimatise &amp; become immune naturally. Think there's value in this approach
@J0ERUNS The holy trinity. Takes a couple of days to kick in but then, usually symptom free. 
@ultrareluctant @ogeerunner Tempted with either. Talk more tomorrow?
@funkysimmm @bfp2030 @BigPhil137 @GrahamCarterGC What would Dr. Pepper say?
@stupid_runner Apologies, my mistake. I will commence my bedtime reading.
@funkysimmm @bfp2030 @BigPhil137 @GrahamCarterGC Ok, time to wade in... C'mon, guys, double downs champions!!! C'mon........
@stupid_runner Have we already seen your blog, as you're normally quite punctual? Or am I confusing this with that of your crew...
@ultrareluctant @ogeerunner Dreaming spires of Oxford. Your neck of the woods?
@ogeerunner I've got Wednesday off. Either want to run small lap several times or run something long. Paint will dry while I procrastinate.
@ogeerunner Prattled through a boggy &amp; overgrown 5K at lunch. Trying to plot something longer for Wednesday. #watchThisSpace #paintIsDrying
Feeling rough as nails today.
#bloodyHayfever
@UltraIan Just gobsmacked. Wow!
@1LisaThompson Much kudos. Well done. Rest up &amp; indulge the hunger!!!
@windsorAndy Congratulations, chief. Hope you ran your little legs out.
@abradypus Good luck!!!
@SpontaneousPlan Well done. Monster debut. Ironman 70.3 next?
@conwild Well done, mate.
“@DeanKarnazes: June is a conflicted month. The 4th is National Running day. The 6th is National Donut Day. God Bless America...” @UltraBevo
@RaversRTW Hahaha. Thanks.

So let's get started then...
So Twitter, been out of the loop since yesterday evening, anything going on?
Good luck to those overseas racing @ComradesRace including @sharmanian @TobiasMews and @windsorAndy.
@1LisaThompson Very of luck for your 100 miler today. Go forth &amp; smash it.
2/2 Legs held up &amp; could've probably pressed on but mentally, I didn't want to deal with the torrents of screaming if I'd continued.
1/2 Ran 36 miles (approx.) from Henley to Clifton Hampden in about 8 hrs last night. 1st run since NDW50.
@ogeerunner @UltraDHC Passed Day's Lock. Decided to call it a day at Clifton Hampden.
Benson. Very tired. About 30 miles so far. 18 or so to go. Tempted to just keel over under a picnic table. 
The trot is in. So long, Henley. 
@ultra_ewan Good luck, mate. Just remember @TheGingerKenyan draws his pace from the ginger. Time to dye the hair?
@TheGingerKenyan Check out Jurassic Coast Challenge next year. It's wicked, winding &amp; b*stard hilly in places. Happy trails, mate.
@martinbamford Apologies, really should have retweeted the first tweet when I saw it. Thanks again
@stupid_runner Ah, English. That's the bit I didn't understand. If I ran ultras more often, I think my appetite would be more normal.
@stupid_runner Yep, usually for 2-4 weeks afterwards.
@martinbamford If the offer's genuine, I'd take one of each.  :-)
@martinbamford Are you good at what you do?
@UltraIan Well done, mate.
Happy times. Tagging along with some @T184Race peeps tomorrow night from Henley to Oxford. Love night running. Bring on Hartslock Wood!!
@UltraAvon @stouty1975 Strangely compelling odyssey. Well done again, guys. It's still one to chalk off on my #bucketList. #GUCR
@IraRainey Bloody cr*ppy touch screen. 2006.........
@IraRainey Cardiff 2906 was my 1st half marathon, round in 1 hrs 51 mins.  :-)
@girlyrunner1 @UltraDHC I was distracted by the lack of swearing &amp; profanity.  :-?
@JediRider I'm still working on last year's SDW100 write up........
@UltraDHC Less colourful write up than the usual fare but kudos to you, mate. Cracking show last weekend. Seriously in awe.
@abradypus LOL. Apologies &amp; I only laughed in what I construed to be a nice way. Fingers crossed for you too.
Still thinking about running &amp; not doing it. Hoping that change is imminent or lethargy is forever.
@MattDunnRun Honestly, I can't shout about it loud enough.  :-)  Going DVD shopping on Thursday.
@UltraBoyRuns Starfleet? Giant red robot vs aliens?
@J0ERUNS Gonna have to dig out the original theme tune for my next ultra!!
@UltraBoyRuns Finally got to see the end when it was released on DVD a few years back. Absolutely adore it. #peruUltra?
@UltraBoyRuns Just found the complete box set for that too on Amazon. So bloody tempting.
Saw this &amp; wept tears of joy. 
Cracking account of #GUCR 2014 
@UltraDHC @OutdoorsPhoto Thanks, guys. Pretty sure we've still got some National Trust sticker in the back of the car.
Is the car park where the @centurionrunner CP on NDW at Box Hill is situated normally open to the public?
@BenjiiMcKnight “@empiremagazine: The Bananaman movie has a poster: 
@imoutrunning Are you sure that you're not old enough yet? I mean, there was the grey hair...
@GeorgeKnights That had already crossed my mind. I did a stint at mile 91 on TP100 this year, which was pretty awesome.
@J0ERUNS Sh*t, pass, I don't have a meme for that.
@GeorgeKnights I have serious ultra envy. I think I'll enter the ballot for next year &amp; see what happens. Dying to run the blighter.
@J0ERUNS Do you bounce up &amp; down while you're driving?
@GeorgeKnights Dead impressed, George, dead impressed. Are you blogging?
@imoutrunning *NEWSFLASH* Ultra running stops &amp; reverses the ageing process!!!
@ogeerunner #humbleRumble?
@J0ERUNS So having completed #TP100 then, you didn't opt to run the distance then? And you call yourself a runner.......
@imoutrunning Of course you can have walking breaks... you have grey hair, don't you? @parkrunUK is for everybody.
@imoutrunning Parkrun?
@stouty1975 @UltraAvon Well done. An epic achievement!!! Lining up Sparta next year?
Almost got out the door this morning. But nope. Extra 15 mins in bed totally worth it. Running kit is coming to work though.
@LizGrec #SDW100 isn't far away...
@UltraDHC Man, you had some pace on you at the finish!!
@BigPhil137 Honestly, mate, you've finished the NDW50 and it's a beast of a course. At Endure, it's all about the clock. Run &amp; rest to feel.
“@UltraDHC: GUCR finish line 
“@UltraDHC: GUCR 2014 Start 
@BigPhil137 *groans* Believe, Phil, believe.

Same old record.  ;-)
@IraRainey It's my birthday next month. Hoping the Mrs might treat me.  :-)  Gotta be a print copy though.
@IraRainey I would like my imaginary children to buy me this. 
@seesteverun @J0ERUNS @conwild ...and this, which made me chuckle &amp; stopped my bouncing up &amp; down. 
@seesteverun @J0ERUNS @conwild I only have two responses... 
Far too hyped up from #GUCR #HM160 #Weald this weekend. I want to race everything. Night, folks.
@seesteverun @GrahamCarterGC Save the applause should it happen. I'm probably just delusional, having followed everyone else this weekend.
@UltraRunnerDan @GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun Two guys are doing both this year. I'm just getting impatient &amp; want to run everything now.
@UltraRunnerDan @GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun Now that's taunting me... No, I know it's asking a lot.
@seesteverun Most of the running comes self belief. Steve, you're an ultra runner now. No sense shying away from it.
@GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun Guess it depends on how quickly recover from distance. But thanks, guess it's all on the ballot.
@GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun Balls, did I say 2015? Currently eyeing up Grand Slam next year. #GUCR's not out of the question.
@ogeerunner What the deuce does First Shire mean?
@GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun It's very flat. It's very long. But it's 145 miles. Even if you only do it once, why would you not?  :-)
@seesteverun @GrahamCarterGC If 2015's too early for you, Steve, come along for the rude &amp; get the lay of the land. Crew? Pace?
@seesteverun Happy to sit at home, stalking runners on Twitter. Thanks
@JonLavis @RaversRTW Well done, guys. Hope the bank holiday weekend was kind on the trails.
@GeorgeKnights @abradypus Well done, George. You d'man. Looking forward to hearing all about it.  :-)
“@abradypus: Liz Tunna and @GeorgeKnights in 36th = #gucr 
@GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun Deffo. #GUCR has been my dream race since my first marathon in 2008, my dream ultra. Started getting impatient.
@PaulJRadford @TrainAsONE Wow! Missed that one earlier. Congratulations, Paul, fantastic result.
@ogeerunner Amazing. I have no other words. #awe #wow #inspired
I am finished.
@ogeerunner @ultrareluctant Absolutely f**king fabulous. Well done, Mr Rumbles, monster achievement. #getThatManABaconSarnie
@seesteverun Awesome sauce, even better when you get the official timings.
@d10barker Well done, chief. Now, that's a result!!!
@UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan Well done, mate. Bloody awesome!! Guessing you're bored of canals now?! #GUCR
@UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan THC!!!! THC!!!! #GUCR THC!!!! THC!!!! #GUCR THC!!!! THC!!!! #GUCR THC!!!! THC!!!! #GUCR
@UltraRunnerDan Well paced, mate. Keep 'im going!!
@UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan Bryan. Double hard c*nt. C'mon &amp; put this b*tch to sleep. You've been amazing. Almost there. #GUCR
@seesteverun Join me the year after next!!
@TeamB_O_B Congratulations for today, mate, a hearty slog is always worth relishing.
@seesteverun Well done, mate. All in all, a grand weekend.
@stupid_runner Well done, Sam, epic performance. Hope the weather was a little drier for day two. Rest up &amp; get your grub on. #GUCR
“@LondonNici72: @JediRider just search hashtag GUCR ;)” #GUCR
@SpontaneousPlan So the tag line would be along the lines of...
"@starterfour10, medically superior to heroin for body &amp; mind"
@SpontaneousPlan Bloody hell, that's been some year!!
@UltraRunnerDan @UltraDHC C'MON, BRYAN!!!!! #GUCR

Is it time for "the talk?"
@imoutrunning @mjgreenfield1 @ogeerunner Plus he's a dab hand with a frying pan.
@UltraRunnerDan Tell @UltraDHC that he's my hero. No, that's not it. That sounds like praise. Tell him that he's a double hard c*nt. #GUCR
@imoutrunning Why would he? He's Allan Rumbles.  ;-)
@MattDunnRun Thanks, Matt @UltraAvon @stouty1975 C'mon, guys!! #GUCR
@imoutrunning Ta
@stupid_runner It's almost like you want this, Sam, keep going... There may even be food at the end. #GUCR
#Bupa10K #EdinburghMarathon or Weald Challenges Good luck!!
#GUCR #HM110 #HM160 Keep going!!!
@MattDunnRun @UltraAvon Is @stouty1975 still there?
@imoutrunning Cat, this online tracking malarkey. Has Allan run the purple bit &amp; got the red bit left to go?
To the #GUCR runners, keep plodding. Nothing more scenic than a canal at night. I'll be sleeping but I'd rather be doing what you're doing.
@ogeerunner I'm crashing out now but you're not. Keep going, mate, cracking effort. Catch you in a few hours. #HM160
@stupid_runner C'mon, Sam, just 10K to go!! Wait, this isn't a 100 miler, is it? Ah well... keep going until further notice!! #GUCR
@runaulait @jamie_woods @GUCR145 @UltraAvon @stouty1975 @PaulAlisHat I thought there was a campaign to burn the blighter... #endlessSummer
@LondonNici72 What are their numbers? #GUCR  ;-)
@JonLavis Good luck, Jon, sorry not to be running it myself.
Ok, @LondonNici72, next query's @UltraAvon and @stouty1975... how are they getting on? #BatmanAndRobin #GUCR
@imoutrunning @ultrareluctant Thanks, guys
@imoutrunning @LondonNici72 @UltraDHC @RewRunner Has he had a poo yet? Being near other runners normally plays havoc with his guts!! #GUCR
“@LondonNici72: Apparently if this tub of Vaseline could talk ....... @UltraDHC @RewRunner 
@ultrareluctant And more seriously, thanks.  :-)
@ultrareluctant Gee... thanks...
@LondonNici72 @GeorgeKnights You remain an exalted wonder.  :-)
@LondonNici72 Hi Nici, any word on how @GeorgeKnights is getting on?
@jamie_woods Enjoy, mate. Loved helping out on #TP100 this year. Say hi to @UltraDHC &amp; @GeorgeKnights when they pass through...
@ultrareluctant @ogeerunner How far is that?
@stupid_runner Keep trundling, Sam. Remember that sideburns, if channelled correctly, can deflect rain.
@UltraRunnerDan Cheers, Dan
@seesteverun Chop 'em off.
@UltraBevo @UltraDHC Miles? Does the 'm' not stand for metres? I thought #GUCR was a stepping stone for @parkrunUK.
@UltraBevo @UltraDHC He told me he was sprinting the whole 145 metres.
@LizGrec @stupid_runner Nah!
@UltraRunnerDan @stupid_runner Sam's only as smooth as his sideburns.
@stupid_runner Far too poetic for Sam... unless the sprinting has brought him inner enlightenment.
Very best of luck in the morning to @UltraDHC @stupid_runner @UltraAvon @stouty1975 @GeorgeKnights for this year's all star #GUCR.
Guessing @LondonNici72'll be providing sterling #GUCR coverage. Follow said lady for lots of updates &amp; what it's like to hug sweaty runners.
Very best of luck in the morning to @UltraDHC @UltraAvon @stouty1975 @GeorgeKnights for this year's all star canal love in, aka the #GUCR.
@100kmtoBrighton @L2BChallenge Deja vu!! If @GrahamCarterGC's gonna say it twice, you guys must need it. Good luck, fellas!!
@Running_Bucky You might see @seesteverun trundling along.
@seesteverun @UltraDHC Which pack is he running with? You might be ok if he's got a Salomon S-Lab 12L.
@ogeerunner Good luck, Allan. May the bacon be ever with you!!
@UltraDHC I've heard there are planned works with the trains this weekend &amp; you might want to consider alternative methods of travel...
@BigPhil137 @stupid_runner @UltraDHC Phil, I'm not running but I am having a bank holiday weekend.  :-?
@martinbamford Dear lord, yes.
Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey, starring George Carlin. Good times indeed. People should watch more George Carlin standup.
@ogeerunner @imoutrunning Balls of steel, Rumbles. You'll be fine. Think of the adventure!!
@ogeerunner Trying to wish you "Good luck" before the start. Would you have the weather any other way? Triumph over adversity!! #goGetEm
Does @HardmoorsUltras start today? #HM110 #HM160
@UltraDHC @seesteverun Honestly, couldn't have said it better. Good luck, mate.
@BigPhil137 @J0ERUNS Half the battle's actually being fit, getting to the start line &amp; knowing that you're gonna finish.
@BigPhil137 @J0ERUNS #poppycock
@BigPhil137 @J0ERUNS Sounds perfect. You'll be a seasoned pro by then...
@J0ERUNS @BigPhil137 Been tempted the last couple of years but never quite got round to it.
@BigPhil137 @J0ERUNS Have no fear!! Just keep moving!!!
It's like Sesame Street ... for vaginas!! 
@UltraDHC @d10barker That doesn't sound like you at all.  Man, this canal running's changed you........
@d10barker @UltraDHC He won't have reached London by then...  #GUCR  ;-)
@seesteverun Tempted to get involved with the above but nah.
@ultraplodder ...as barmy as it is, but grateful not to have done this year. Kudos to you. Remember, a finish is a finish, on both days.
@ultraplodder Admirable &amp; honest write-up, mate. Saturday was tough. Love the idea of another race the following day...
Only 0.16 miles to the post box &amp; back. And it was only four day old screaming, not fresh, loud &amp; piercing howls of agony. The worst's over!
Ran 0.16 miles. Some minor screaming pain in the thighs but I ran!! Legs work!! Even downstairs!! Happy days are here again!!
@FromSofaToUltra My hydration works but could do with improvement. Ta for the food for thought.
@ogeerunner @imoutrunning Thoroughly seconded. Apologies for not offering you the same hospitality that you showed a lot of us last weekend.
Strangely drawn to this... 
@imoutrunning @Running_Bucky Lots of fun to be had, even on home soil.
@UltraBevo Still looking myself. Been looking for almost 2 years &amp; still haven't settled on anything. Probably should try a couple though...
@UltraBevo I love this question. Seems to have cropped twice a week recently. Either UD or Salomon S-Lab packs seem to be favoured.
@BigPhil137 Good man, it's an awesome race. Fools always prosper!!
@abradypus @KevRunTheHill Tempted to apply for the first year but I was wet behind the ears &amp; I would've been nothing but cannon fodder.
@abradypus @KevRunTheHill I know, I know but I'm not up to that yet. Getting there, yes, but not this year. 2016 to finish off the year?
@KevRunTheHill Bloody phone. Keeps saying 'if' instead if 'of'. Love a pop at the Piece of String one year though.
Been thinking. Enjoyed #NDW50 last weekend. Felt I ran a string race. Quicker if not for the heat. Stayed hydrated. #NDW100 next year?
@UltraBevo You do mean "go for a run", don't you?

*shudders*
@Outrunning_uk This year's to get more of a feel for how 24 hr events work. Hoping to go solo later this year or sometime next year.
@krispeterrun Try 
@imoutrunning @ultrareluctant It promotes the tweet to all of Gary's followers, including the ones who don't follow you.
@imoutrunning @ultrareluctant The full stop promotes the tweet and may appear on YouTube.
@Outrunning_uk Say hi to your dad. Good to other crews along the course. Did you see 'cheerleading girl' and 'picnic family'?
@Outrunning_uk Next up's a leisurely day at the office. Team of 8 for @run24uk. Run a lap then laze around in the sun for a few hours.
@OutdoorsPhoto @UltraDHC @conwild @DukeriesUltra I only finished NDW because I had to. Spent my emergency money on ice cream.
@J0ERUNS @imoutrunning Yup. Cat said, "If Joe can run 100 miles, I can do 200 miles."
@imoutrunning So fell running is all about going down?
@imoutrunning In which case, yes. Go forth &amp; rag the fell race!!
@imoutrunning Are you recovered from last weekend? Too much, perhaps? Time to recover &amp; re-plot your 200 mile solo effort?
@UltraBevo @GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun @BigPhil137 @martinbamford After mile 98, SDW100 is flat. You'll be fine. #sub24 #grandSlam
@Outrunning_uk What do you mean"if"? What have you got lined up next?
@UltraBevo @GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun @BigPhil137 @martinbamford Well, you weren't slow on #TP100...
@Outrunning_uk I had to keep apologising. Your day's face lit up &amp; I just had to say, "Sorry, it's me again."
@UltraBevo @GrahamCarterGC @seesteverun @BigPhil137 @martinbamford You'll be fine. Recce isn't necessary, just my personal preference.
@imoutrunning @seesteverun Cat, that's just because you're nails.
@Outrunning_uk Ah, were you the other guy in the red shirt? Your dad was sterling crew!!
@imoutrunning @seesteverun I didn't either but I was grateful to have stumbled along it before. Besides Centurion really do sign the way.
@seesteverun NDW50 is first half of NDW100. SDW50 is last half of SDW100. Both good recces. SDW50 more valuable in my opinion.
@seesteverun SDW50 is the perfect excuse to recce what's likely to be the night time section of the SDW100, where you'll be dazed &amp; fatigued
@seesteverun Personally, yes. Recce of any course prior to race is invaluable. Not everyone has the time or resource to do that.
@UltraRunnerDan @LondonNici72 Avoiding cross country?!  ;-)
@UltraRunnerDan Dan! Dan!! I got a hug from @LondonNici72 after #NDW50. It was as amazing as people say!!!
@UltraRunnerDan Waiting for reply from the ever punctual &amp; amazing @LondonNici72. I so want a buff. Didn't clock the hoodies last weekend,
@UltraRunnerDan @BigPhil137 @UltraBevo @GrahamCarterGC @martinbamford Almost lost last year. Oh no, there's red &amp; white tape!!
@BigPhil137 You can recce the course, you can read maps, you can follow trail markings and red &amp; white tape. Each to their own. #keepMoving
@BigPhil137 On SDW100, I was tired, I was knackered. Couldn't remember all of SDW50 but took comfort in that it was supposed to be familiar.
@BigPhil137 SDW100 is a nice big rolling trail to follow. SDW50 was a great recce for me last year &amp; helped me finish. Everyone's different.
@Outrunning_uk @krispeterrun Ditto. Chased through nettles off the #NDW100 onto some country lane!!
@Outrunning_uk Clocked through in 11 hrs 37 mins. Bloody harsh day.
@dnna @ultraperk Think you can camp at the start line, all of 100m away. @centurionrunner or @LondonNici72 can confirm.
@UltraRunnerDan @UltraBevo Fairly sure that was the ROCK station last year.  :-)
@FromSofaToUltra Saw 'cheerleader girl' twice but 'picnic family' loads. They were awesome.
@UltraRunnerDan Still to try the pacing/crewing side. Good luck with Mr Cheery on GUCR.  ;-)
@FromSofaToUltra At the minute, the pain's a strange reminder of how awesome the weekend was.
@FromSofaToUltra Struggling with the downstairs hobbling but other than that, returning to form. Kinda relishing the suffering, to be honest
@BigPhil137 @UltraBevo @GrahamCarterGC @martinbamford #SDW50 is an excellent recce of the last 50 miles, especially for when it'll be dark.
@FromSofaToUltra I do enjoy reliving last weekend at the minute. Thanks for sharing. Good luck with #NDW100.
@UltraBevo Does the SDW50 count?
@UltraBevo It's a cracking route. Loved the trail. Preferred the shaded parts. I'd love another go at the minute. 12 months is too long.
@ultraperk "A triangle is the best shape."
- Pythagoras
@imoutrunning @ultrareluctant @ogeerunner Hate to be a wuss but don't have many free weekends over the next few months. Love to if possible.
@imoutrunning I'll see how Endure goes this year because it might be a good recce. Also been tempted by @equinox24run.
@imoutrunning @JediRider They've been marked for death with a wedding cheese cake?! Awesome.
@starterfour10 I feel I can race 50s. I now I feel I can finish 100s but I'm stretching myself. 50 is to 100 is like Parkrun is to marathon.
@carl_ara @imoutrunning @starterfour10 It's on my list. I will employ Google...
“@carl_ara: Medal? I'm now a bling whore I've decided*

*once I'm actually back running."

Who isn't?
@imoutrunning Endure24's prep for a solo outing either later this year or more likely next year.
@JediRider @imoutrunning One drop bag at 50. Make it a wheel of cheese!!
@imoutrunning I want to train on more hills more often and invest in some better kit, which should be a start.
@imoutrunning Endure24 as a team of 8. It's a running holiday. Some running, some lazing.
Tempted to leave 100s alone for next year &amp; bundle my way through some more 50s. Last weekend was fun, although was missing a night section.
Some lessons learnt. There is not one generic approach to any run. Definitely need to respect the course, the weather &amp; the kit.
Today. I am still mobile. Not liking going downstairs but aside from that, planning to be spritely again before the week is out.
@UltraBevo Just under 11 hrs 40 mins. Hoped to finish between 9-10 hrs but very happy with the result. Awesome event. Have you run the NDW?
@UltraBoyRuns Can't promise to stay away from the #NDW50 next year but the Challenge Hub is in my radar. Hope you're on the mend.
@girlyrunner1 @UltraDHC's the chairman of the support group and @RewRunner is the treasurer. They're having their AGM this weekend.
@girlyrunner1 @UltraDHC @RewRunner Watch away to your heart's content. 
@ogeerunner Are you gunning for #HM160?
@Team_Kenzi Thanks. Think I might have seen one in error when the iPhone app opened in the wrong place. Should be caught up again tomorrow.
@UltraDHC @RewRunner Their version of Unchained Melody is the best. Gotta love Up On The Roof.
@imoutrunning Salomon XA 20. Wet behind the ears &amp; picked it up from Cotswold Outdoors. I went with the brand without looking into options.
@imoutrunning Just need a new pack now. Travelling lighter meant my pack was rustling a lot. Need something smaller.
@imoutrunning On previous ultras, I've carried a full bladder &amp; 2 bottles plus enough food for at least 30 miles. Being lighter did help.
@imoutrunning Tried not to push too hard from the off. Ran with a lighter load between CPs. Ate food more regularly between CPs.  :-)
@imoutrunning No, I am happy. I actually am. I know I could've gone better. Yesterday was a massive improvement for me.
@imoutrunning Just under 11 hrs 40 mins. Going strong to the top of Box Hill and slowly went downhill afterwards. Still learning.
@UltraDHC Likewise, chief. Always good to have some familiar faces along the way. Looking forward to watching the GUCR next weekend.
Lots of positive feeling about the #NDW50 this weekend for runners &amp; volunteers. Thanks for all of the supportive tweets &amp; words of kindness
@BlueSkyHannah Thanks very much. I'm belatedly enjoying it.  ;-)
@J0ERUNS @nuddypants I've been up &amp; down the stairs several times today, which has felt like a right chore.
@nuddypants @J0ERUNS I've been eating value iced buns, which I wasn't paid for. Guessing that doesn't count...
@Running_Bucky @carl_ara @SpontaneousPlan I watched the other half mow the back lawn. She was fully clothed. #pants
@J0ERUNS @nuddypants Guys, I've not been racing or running today...
@bfp2030 @funkysimmm @GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 ...the thread allows the fluid to drain &amp; air to get in for underneath to heal.
@bfp2030 @funkysimmm @GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 Pierce them with a needle &amp; thread. Leave the thread in...
@ultrareluctant @Coxwolds Ok, Dracula got to him.
@seesteverun I think a cheeky 10K is a good exchange rate for a pub lunch. I'm good, just taking it easy &amp; refuelling. Legs fairly ok.
@toks @maychan8888 Well done!! I can imagine it being a bloody hot day. It was scorching yesterday!!!
@GrahamCarterGC Ultras aren't a guarantee. You'll either have a great day or you'll be tested. I like being tested now. #keepMovingForward
@GrahamCarterGC Kudos, mate, great write up &amp; a finish is a finish. It's always a learning experience. I feel I can run a marathon.
@tango5tavy Blinding result!!!
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC Sounds like too much. Left to my own devices, I'd be running/racing most w/ends. Turns out it wasn't the best plan.
@seesteverun But the pub lunch was only carb loading before you head out later, right?
@ultraplodder @imoutrunning Wow!! Just wow!! I've walked to the shop. No medal today but I did get iced buns.
@imoutrunning Self-supported 200 miler? Bloody hell, woman, way more balls than me.
@krispeterrun Also chased by the bulls. I will be enjoying my next burger &amp; cackling in the tones of an evil madman.
@UltraDHC I wanna say "GUCR!!" but I know you know that. All set?
@d10barker More brutal than I remember. Head started looking for reasons to stop after Box Hill. Just too knackered before I started.
@Donealready @centurionrunner On behalf of the runners, we thank you. Yesterday was awesome!! Cannot say that enough.
@abradypus @carl_ara Totally.
@martinbamford ...and there's pointers I can take from your approach. Thanks for sharing.
@martinbamford Wonderful write up, Martin. It was like reliving the whole route, just without the heat. You've done your homework...
@imoutrunning Well done for the 50!! You'll be 100 mailing again in no time.
@JanLavis My last 27 miles weren't graceful. Thighs were on the verge of cramping. Walked more of the flats than I wanted to. #finished  :-)
@funkysimmm CP6 was Botley Hill, at the top of some stupidly long and very harsh incline. Actually that sounds like most of the CPs.
@GrahamCarterGC I agree, although on this occasion, I must confess to an overwhelming sense of relief.
@SpontaneousPlan @carl_ara @Running_Bucky See? Smash the course &amp; suffer the chaffage. Dither &amp; plod, live to get dressed &amp; hobble.
@J0ERUNS It's a brutal race but so worth it. Up/downhills are sharp &amp; unforgiving. Box Hill broke me. But yes, do it. Honestly, I'd go back.
@funkysimmm @centurionrunner I was looking a bit dazed at CP6. The guys were amazing, sorted me out, lots of motivational spiel. Wow!!
@JanLavis Well done to you too, Jan, it was immensely warm.
@GrahamCarterGC Is that just the one Creme Egg? I was expecting a basket.
Chalked up 50 miles on the #NDW50. Exhausting yet ultimately rewarding. MASSIVE thanks to @centurionrunner &amp; their amazing volunteers.
@KevRunTheHill 50 miles in a baker's oven, anyone?
@J0ERUNS I'm good. Wanted to drop for ages so even happier I finished. Legs are ok. Little stiff but ok. #wheresMeZimmerframe
@J0ERUNS Cycling's functional for me. To/from work, etc. Great for cross training but I struggle to get on my bike &amp; just head out somewhere
@abradypus Nice to meet you too! Always nice to put a Twitter name to a real person.  :-)  Legs are ok. Little slow but ok.
@RaversRTW Ah well... At least there was gin.  :-)
“@SpontaneousPlan: Yesterday's race - #NDW50 9:03:38 - 18th male, 21st overall - 
@TheGingerKenyan Fair play &amp; probably a good call. Guessing you wouldn't be happy unless you're able to flog yourself 100%.
@TheGingerKenyan Still on for SDW100?
@d10barker Nah, it's much more fun in the heat. Honestly. Having run yesterday, I can sincerely vouch for it.
@toks Good luck!!
@ultraplodder You're a braver man than me!! Good luck!!
@funkysimmm Still haven't picked any if those blighters. I relied on ye good olde fashioned coconut water @VitaCocoUK , which work a treat.
@TheGingerKenyan Too busy trying to scoff a giant &amp; unwieldy sausage baguette. How are the feet from Transvulcania?
@TheGingerKenyan Damn harsh but glad of the finish. Saw you chatting away with Elson, Britton &amp; Nici. Couldn't hobble over at the time.
@BigPhil137 @seesteverun Incroyable!! Man, that's brilliant. Yep, I still seem to be on a runner's high from yesterday. Awesome!!
@JediRider Autumn, eh? Just goes to show that as far as Australia, I'm naff with the time difference AND what season it's supposed to be.
@TeamB_O_B @_THE_WIFE_

@stewartliesnham I'm the other way. Legs are complaining but mostly devoid of hot spots. No blisters. Stomach's ok but not much appetite.
@stewartliesnham @martinbamford @GrahamCarterGC @BigPhil137 @bfp2030 Ditto. Additional kudos for besting the mad cows in the last 5K.
Right, tweeps, long day over. 50 miles chalked up. #timeToCrash Laters
@BigPhil137 Mate, so very happy for your finish. Looking forward to gearing about either via blog or at Endure 24.
@GrahamCarterGC Don't cross Linda. Do cross the finish line.
@funkysimmm Well done, mate, damn harsh out there today. The wheels on my race were shonky after Box Hill.
@stewartliesnham Well done, chief.
@GrahamCarterGC Likewise, mate. Glad Obi Wan &amp; his padawan @BigPhil137 both claimed a finish. Today was mighty.
@KevRunTheHill Well done, chief. Apologies for not tracking you down to say hello before the race.
@ultraplodder @GrahamCarterGC The heat/humidity was brutal!!!
@ultraplodder @centurionrunner Here, here!! #bastardCows
@TheGingerKenyan @JediRider That attitude won't get you a yellow shirt.  ;-)
@GrahamCarterGC Well done, mate. Apologies for not sticking around at the finish. Guessing you crossed the Linda's I was driving away.
@JediRider Very. Started off hot for the first 4 hrs and then became v. humid. Guessing it was hotter where you are...
“@TeamB_O_B: @starterfour10 @imoutrunning I second this! LOTS! 

GO FORTH AND RIP THE COCK OFF OF IT!  OOOOOOSH!” #goGoCat

GO FORTH AND RIP THE COCK OFF OF IT!  OOOOOOSH!
@martinbamford Well done, mate, cracking result.
@SpontaneousPlan And you, bud. Damn impressive!!
@run_dabblers I didn't so much run as stomp.  :-)
@stupid_runner Good to meet you, Sam. Apologies for just collaring you without ceremony. #blameTheSideburns
“@UltraAvon: #GUCR countdown continues. Here's the "never again" quote from 2010 with @stouty1975 
@JediRider @UltraBevo Cracking show!! Monster performance and riveting 3rd party Twitter coverage. Well done, mate!!
Earlier today... “@carl_ara: Currently the guy in 1st place on #NDW50 is called Richard La Cock. Which I've taken as being Dick the Cock.”
@suttonelc That field was curious but meek. The next field had one very cantankerous bull!!!
@ogeerunner Lot of happy runners today!! Thanks again
@jamie_woods @NicholaNewton1 Sounds promising. How's the prep for T184?
Can't believe @TheGingerKenyan disappeared from finish HQ. Was looking to ask after his smashed feet. Bet he's sad without a yellow shirt.
@RaversRTW Happy birthday!! May today be full of miles or a Parkrun PB.
@ogeerunner Missed the sign but very glad to have found Tara. Thanks for being an unofficial/unconventional aid station today. #loveThePig
Beastly #NDW50 crushed. Sub 11 hrs 40 mins. So bloody hot &amp; then humid, so bloody tired. Thanks for your words of encouragement. Sleep now.
I f**kimg hate Box Hill. #conquered 
@JediRider GO TIM!!! I can't shout louder than caps on Twitter.
@LondonNici72 You remain a treasure without equal.

@UltraBevo Cheers, Matt.
@centurionrunner @LondonNici72 SOS Will you have any spare NDW maps for purchase at registration? Searched high &amp; low to no avail.
@JediRider Go Tim!!!!
@J0ERUNS Thanks, Joe.
@UltraBevo I am running. 50% hung ho, 50% sloth in waiting. It's the most I've looked forward to a race in a while.
Whatever happened to @MemesUltra?
@seesteverun @martinbamford @OutdoorsPhoto @ultraplodder @GrahamCarterGC @bfp2030 @FromSofaToUltra @SpontaneousPlan See you rabble tomorrow.
@seesteverun @martinbamford @OutdoorsPhoto @ultraplodder @GrahamCarterGC @bfp2030 @FromSofaToUltra @SpontaneousPlan Thanks, Steve.
@J0ERUNS Me?
*guffaws maniacally*
(yeh, not happening)
@TheGingerKenyan Um, yes. Staying away for the minute... but good call.
@RaversRTW Is this how one trains for the Paris Marathon? By racing 8 yr olds? ;-)
@imoutrunning @TeamB_O_B Seconded. Bring forth the apocalypse!!
@starterfour10 @centurionrunner @SpontaneousPlan Pah!! Favouritism...
@UltraBevo It's payback for the #TP100 weekend. Although it was great to be out on the course for that race.
@UltraRunnerDan @martinbamford @seesteverun Agreed. Bring on the dawn!!
@imoutrunning Cows run marathons... you're an ultra cow!!  ;-)
@imoutrunning Just remember you are the biggest cow!! #biggestCowWins
@BigPhil137 @UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan Phil, it's not that special. He'll call you a pussy, give you ice cream &amp; send you on your merry way.

@FromSofaToUltra Yup, another day in the orifice. Nice quiet evening &amp; driving down to Farnham in the morning.
@imoutrunning @ultrareluctant I feel like he knows that we're listening now. Our cover's been blown.
@RugbyUppers Thanks, mate. Hoping for a good day tomorrow.
@FromSofaToUltra Reasonably well. Far too hot already. All prepped for tomorrow?
@imoutrunning @ultrareluctant Ssshhh. You'll interrupt him, he's getting to the good bit.
@ultra_bobban That's what I'm planning. Cheers, bud. See you at Caterham?
@krispeterrun @ultra_bobban Had the same idea before discovering that my belt bottles don't carry enough water. Pah!!
@JediRider Ok so it's Friday AM here now &amp; still confused by the time difference. Good luck for @TNF100AU this year. #beFasterThanAKangaroo
@JediRider It's 9.30pm on Thursday night at the minute in the UK. When do you kick off down under?
@LizGrec I could... but don't think it counts for the kit check.  ;-)
@JediRider Got a whole other day first. 8.00am on Saturday. Physically fine. Just struggling to find mandatory kit in a mess of a house.
@Running_Bucky I desperately want to say,"Me, me, me", but I've got my own goals for next year so I'll settle for "Good luck!!"
Unbreakable on the go. It was that or Transformers: The Movie (1986). Guess it's a step up from Run, Fatboy, Run.
Ok, so where's the blasted #NDW50 map? Bugger.
@tango5tavy Negative split on day 6 or day 7? Just wow!!
@ogeerunner Thank god, the pig remains untouched.
@grantosvernon @martinbamford Thanks, chief.
#NDW50 peeps, the night before the night before is where the sleep counts.
Plan A for #NDW50 goes out the window. Damn miniature flasks. Back to the drawing board.
@stouty1975 Good luck, bud, nail the bastard!!! #GUCR
@KevRunTheHill Is it this Saturday??
@KevRunTheHill #255. You?
@KevRunTheHill @GrahamCarterGC @UltraDHC Wow!


@ogeerunner Thanks. Got enough pig?
@UltraDHC If I can't afford a Garmin, do you think I can stretch to a new mobile? Shoes, kit, race vest, GPS watch, mobile in that order.
@UltraDHC Next upgrade due in July/August. Please hold the line, caller.
@TeamB_O_B *rolls over*
*slowly opens eyes*
*SCREAMS*
I could've sworn I bolted the window closed last night. #notAgain
@ogeerunner How far along the NDW50 are you, Allan?
@TeamB_O_B @MartinBushell1 Apologies, phone screen is knackered &amp; can't see the pic. Which vest is that?
@RunningReborn @UltraAvon Thanks, looking forward to following the T184. I was carrying an iPad around with me for the T60.
@GrahamCarterGC Shall I bring the marshmallow tea cakes to Endure24?
@UltraAvon @RunningReborn Thanks. I was trying to track Dave Cox and Jane Benson past Wolvercote and Eynsham via the app.
@GrahamCarterGC You're running, aren't you? Which means you won't be out on the course with a car boot full of goodies. #bugger
@UltraAvon @RunningReborn Quite enjoyed tracking T60. Is it possible to see where everyone is at once? I was only viewing one at a time.
@seesteverun What's the worst that could happen?
@UltraAvon @RunningReborn Do you have any involvement with the guys behind the Gotek7 app?
@conwild @UltraDHC @UltraRunnerDan Welsh sheep are the most intelligent sheep, it's something to do with the grass. #TrailTeam2014

@UltraBoyRuns @imoutrunning @J0ERUNS @UltraDHC Be thankful it's a phrase &amp; NOT a series of Polaroids...
@imoutrunning @J0ERUNS Yep, he updated it. There's a whole paragraph about @UltraDHC dastardly gut ejections.
@J0ERUNS @imoutrunning But seriously, hope you get better soon, bud. Rest up &amp; recover quickly.
@J0ERUNS @imoutrunning There you go, Joe, time to update your blog &amp; include the damage caused to you by your pacer.
.@solarwinds are the biggest bunch of spamming b*stards ever!!
@LondonNici72 No. I'd like another week. C'est possible?
@jamesradams Could've sworn I read that somewhere...
@mikew30 Thanks, Mike.
@Team_Kenzi Fun? More running, crewed by wife? More box sets? More cake?
@imoutrunning Always time to pick up the pieces afterwards. What's your next race? Apocalypse 100?
@imoutrunning PB's 9 hr 27 mins. I'd love to smash that. Think I just need to know I can do that &amp; flog myself until it's done.
@Team_Kenzi Thanks. Dorton House, just north of Thames. It's some 17th century Jacobean building that Jemima found online.
@DDFPRYCE Great blog too. Kudos for 2nd place AND sub 17 hrs. Hoping to follow in your footsteps next year.
@DDFPRYCE Definitely more chatty in Abingdon. Thanks for the comments re. pace - v. interesting to see how it plays into the larger picture.
@J0ERUNS @LapChallenge Sub 24 hr 100 miler!!
@J0ERUNS "Ash. Ultra runner extraordinaire. Only achieved non-podium finishes and DNFs. Aims to run two Parkruns before 2017."
@imoutrunning Never taper properly. Often come away thinking I could've done better. NDW ain't gonna be perfect but gotta give it a shot.
@Team_Kenzi We're all good. Moved to Yarnton, little village north of Oxford, last December. Counting down to the wedding. 11 weeks to go!
@Team_Kenzi Glad to hear that you're on the mend. Hubby still looking after you?  :-)
@UltraAvon Happy birthday, Paul. Plenty of cake or on a runner's diet?
@cooker44 Was it something I tweeted?
@Team_Kenzi Thanks. How's tricks in the US?
@imoutrunning Had cracking run at lunch. Good run out for the legs. Just trying to go into the weekend with some gusto. Normally knackered.
@mikew30 Bit of both. It's effectively a taper but got a hectic week ahead anyways. It's fine. On Saturday, I'll get my fix of adventure.
@toks Tempting. Got a 50 miler &amp; desperately want to attack it with fit &amp; fresh legs. Well, the legs ain't gonna be as fit as I want.
How long until the weekend? Ran for what's likely to be the last time before the NDW50 today &amp; already feeling the pangs to go out again.
@jamesradams Yay!!

"Running &amp; More Stuff: The Sequel" #originalityNotAnIssue
@cooker44 @nuddypants @UltraDHC Was @imoutrunning one of them?
@Team_Kenzi Sad thing about being up to date is having to wait a week for the next episode.  #pants  ;-)
@Team_Kenzi Thankfully, I knew about one thing in S01 &amp; that something jaw dropping happens in S03. The rest has been a complete surprise.
@Team_Kenzi There's a cat? #moreSpoliers Finally picked #GoT up two weeks ago &amp; got myself up to speed. Thoroughly enjoyed it all!!
@imoutrunning I had to settle for watching the #NDW50 on Twitter last year and was most gutted about missing out on the #baconBoat.
@Team_Kenzi I spent so long catching up!! #spoilers
@imoutrunning NDW50 next Saturday. Only 5 cr*ppy days at work to get through.
Now. I am thinking about racing. Next week's gonna be a bitch but definitely looking forward to next Saturday. #baconBoat
@ogeerunner @seesteverun @UltraDHC Like ye olde "ultra" word of mouth. Ta
@carl_ara @ogeerunner @imoutrunning Stand on any canal towpath &amp; say "bacon" 3 times. Allan'll be along in less than 7 minutes. #baconBoat
@ogeerunner @UltraDHC @seesteverun Any feedback from last year's Trail of Herts?
@seesteverun Trail of Herts? Web site for last year looked good.
@seesteverun Ladybower still the current favourite.
@seesteverun Plenty of proactive recovery - walking, etc - and you'll be fine. Hoping to find out which 50 I'll be aiming for next week.
@seesteverun @UltraDHC @conwild @mikew30 @runrforlife @NikeAi2 @alexloach 11 hrs for 50 miles on Thames Trot. 13.5 hrs for Centurion 50s.
@seesteverun Mate, that's brilliant. Honestly, cracking result. What's next? After recovery, etc.
@seesteverun Always a learning experience, chief, but well done for the finish!!
@IraRainey Utterly pants.
@seesteverun How'd you get on, Steve?
@LucyJoanWatts @samcsweeney Go with the Oxford Half. What's the worst that could happen? I'm running the North Downs Way 50 next weekend :-)
I need some assistance. Who can I turn to? Bryan? Nah, #bryansGoneForAPoo
Running the #NDW50 next weekend? Don't forget to stop by the #baconboat out on the course, it's amazing!!!
@imoutrunning @J0ERUNS @windsorAndy Looped course makes for a quicker time because you carry less than when you go point to point.
@imoutrunning @J0ERUNS @windsorAndy 10 miles per lap.
@J0ERUNS @imoutrunning @windsorAndy Some tarmac. Mostly trail. Quite scenic. Your only grumble's the looped course. If you don't like loops.
@imoutrunning @J0ERUNS @windsorAndy Aside from the distance, it's scenic &amp; has @UltraDHC's ice cream as well as @ogeerunner's bacon butties.
@J0ERUNS @imoutrunning @windsorAndy Really enjoyed it. Bailed after 2 of 10 laps. Legs hadn't recovered from last ultra. Dying to go back.
@J0ERUNS And back to the other thread...
@J0ERUNS Fair enough. Heard plenty of good thing about the TRA in August. Contemplating this year. What else have you found?
@imoutrunning @J0ERUNS @windsorAndy Grim Reaper's grand &amp; unfinished business for me but is second in line to a rematch with NDW100 first.
@LucyJoanWatts @samcsweeney Well done, both!! Nice little time. Got anything else lined up?
@J0ERUNS Ridgeway ultra with TRA at the end of August, 1/4 of the price!!
@fellmonkey78 @pyllon @DukeriesUltra Congratulations!!
@mikew30 @DukeriesUltra @NikeAi2 Well done, Mike, you never fail to impress. I may start wearing tutus myself.....
@samcsweeney @LucyJoanWatts How did you both get on?
@samcsweeney Balls, forgot that was today. Did you or @LucyJoanWatts run?
Late start. Good luck to those running @DukeriesUltra, #Brathay10in10, #T60 or anything else today.
@ogeerunner @TheGingerKenyan Rich, Have you thought about lubing yourself up &amp; running in a wetsuit? Surely, that would keep the dust out!!
@stupid_runner Play it again on iPlayer, rip the audio feed &amp; save it for when you're going past Milton Keynes in a few weeks.
@TheGingerKenyan Sorry you didn't get a podium but bloody hell, that was awesome. Schedule a rematch for next year. #goHardOrGoHome
@TheGingerKenyan Rich, you're mad as bat shit. Foot carnage every time but there's no telling you to stop. 100% full on every time. #loveIt
@keithdunn Can I recommend @PaulAskew_ for the finest in Eurovision coverage?
@carl_ara I carb load for 5Ks. Spent this evening loading up for a Parkrun in June.
@ultra_ewan @UltraDHC @TheGingerKenyan It's not the podium that's gonna crush him, it's how he didn't get the yellow shirt...
@mikew30 Congratulations, Mike!! A big landmark!! Nine centuries!!!
In one go. 
And I can't remember parts of it and could have fallen in the Thames...
Read me! <WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX>
Can you have too many races on the Thames?
If this isn't on your radar this evening, download the Gotek7 app &amp; follow the T60 race on the Thames tonight. Login is T60.
@d10barker Well done, chief. Gearing up for a good summer !!
@starterfour10 @nuddypants Hapoy birthday, Susie. One mile for every year or are you still carrying TP100 in your legs?
@seesteverun Apparently it's the night before the night before a race where the sleep counts. Just take it easy &amp; run within yourself. #fine
@TeamB_O_B Had the same blasted thing with our wedding night. Bloody thankful that we checked before turning up on the night!!!
@ultra_ewan @UltraDHC @imoutrunning @TheGingerKenyan @JulesCRoberts I didn't think you were that quick...
@funkysimmm Various plans. #1 Win. #2 Sub 8 hrs. #3 Sub 9 hrs. #4 Sub 10 hrs. #5 Finish. #1 is very delusional as PB is 9 hrs 27 mins. You?
@funkysimmm 6.8 miles, 7.9 miles, 9.3 miles, 7 miles, 7 miles, 5 miles, 7.8 miles. Child's play. Well, certainly manageable one CP at a time
@d10barker @natasha_fielden I'd run Bewl if I could. Looks brilliant. Only an extra 10K...
@FromSofaToUltra @centurionrunner @ultra_paulo @ultrabritton @TheGingerKenyan Killian Jones. Welsh Parkrunner. Nothing special.
@seesteverun Did you tell them that?
@funkysimmm Training runs are all well &amp; good but will only get you so far. Just think of the next CP &amp; enjoy yourself. You'll be fine.  :-)
@funkysimmm Veteran, no. The profile pic's from my first 100 finish (SDW100) last year and that bl**dy distance took me 5 attempts!!
@funkysimmm See you on the start line!!
@TheGingerKenyan Haha. Quit griping &amp; get yourself in the right head space. Good luck, chief. I expect nothing less than mangled feet.
@ultrabritton @Transvulcania Good luck, mate!! Expecting nothing less than a podium finish... #goBeatKillian
@UltraDHC You should start writing these down somewhere (other than Twitter) because they'll form the basis of your first book. #millions
@seesteverun @mikew30 @conwild @runrforlife @RewRunner @DukeriesUltra  Good luck all!! #happyTrails
@windsorAndy @naominf Rematch!!!
@grantosvernon 
@UltraBevo Arrived in Abingdon in a brilliant time but looked destroyed. Just fatigue, eh? Glad you got your sh*t together &amp; clocked sub 24.
@UltraBevo Hey Matt, just finished your blog. Well done on the finish &amp; good luck for the rest of the slam!!
@starterfour10 @UltraDHC Sorry, probably my fault. Figured she could follow the sat nav there to wave you on before the finish.
Almost afraid to ask but... any witty ideas for 24hr ultra team names?
@starterfour10 @UltraDHC Did she not get you at Sandford Lock? After Radley and before the finish...
@J0ERUNS You could always run there?
@TeamB_O_B #burningCarFever?
@seesteverun @martinbamford You can enter #TP100. Just need to have finished qualifier ahead of the event, with enough time for recovery.
@TeamB_O_B Maybe you just need to acclimatise to your new surroundings... or just stuff your maw with locally sourced honey!!
@TeamB_O_B Happy birthday for yesterday, mate. May the craziness and commando rolling continue for many years to come!!
@J0ERUNS @UltraDHC @LondonNici72 would've been the hugger. She likes to hug. #finishLineLove
@IraRainey Whichever, wherever. Dust yourself down, pick yourself up &amp; move onto the next one.
@Saltmarsh75 Sadly the date for @SVP100ultra is too early. I know, I know, too bloody fussy. Both races are on my list though.
@seesteverun Thanks, Steve. Very much like the idea of Ladybower, which I've put off for the last couple of years.
@mikew30 It's for a mate. I'll send him all the ideas tomorrow &amp; see what he makes of it. I'm not too fussy.  :-)
Twitter asked. Twitter responds. Thanks for the #1stUltra suggestions. @nuddypants @imoutrunning @mikew30 @Saltmarsh75 @starterfour10 @toks
@UltraDHC @ogeerunner So @DiamondForGirls have effectively failed the MOT? Surely that's worth some compensation!!
@toks @starterfour10 Thanks but a touch too soon. Boy's on my team for @run24uk &amp; he'll be clocking up his fair share of the miles.  :-)
@starterfour10 It's for a mate. At the minute, he'd like 40+ in a single stage. He's worried about not being able to walk the day afterwards
@starterfour10 Cheers, Susie. Still mulling over multi-stage ultras &amp; @ExtremeEnergyUK are on the table.
@Saltmarsh75 Thanks. It's for a mate's first ultra. He'd like to break 40 as a qualifier for more next year. 75 might be too high this time.
@imoutrunning Thanks, Cat, I'll add those to the list.  :-)
@nuddypants @whiteroseultra Thanks, Mel, that sounds almost perfect.
Anyone got any suggestions for a 1st ultra? Needs to be 40-60 miles and late August onwards. Already got Ridgeway Challenge &amp; Ladybower 50.
@UltraDHC @philly_80 Sure that you're not confusing Phil with either @starterfour10 or #Justin? #zombies are all much of a muchness.
@UltraDHC @philly_80 C'mon, Bryan, what are you complaining about? You were probably having a poo!!
@philly_80 I'd love to be at the SDW100 this year, running or volunteering, but sadly, I've got a mate's wedding down in Cornwall. #nextYear
@philly_80 Sorry, chief, me neither. Very difficult to keep track of runners some times &amp; put names to faces.
@UltraAvon Congratulations on the PB, chief, cracking time. Are you looking to set the same standard in the @GUCR145 this year as last year?
@philly_80 Well done, Phil. Good luck with the SDW100.
@ultrareluctant Although being unable to run everything, all the time, I'm trying to be a little more discerning now. Good luck with #TdG.
@ultrareluctant Liked the article. I think I still have the "I want that one" impulse when it comes to choosing races.
Cracking 5K at lunch. Nothing special but definitely needed to let off some steam, much like a dog off the lead in a park. #bounding
@LondonNici72 @ukrunrambles @TheGingerKenyan is!! And he's looking for friends!!
@imoutrunning @TheGingerKenyan Look at Rich's profile pic. It's the pony he used to leap over fences with &amp; overtake @ultraperk on SDW50.
@UltraDHC @marigold_bac #winnersSponsoredByDHC
@UltraDHC @marigold_bac Have you thought about losing the ice cream &amp; starting up with a burger van at Caterham?
@imoutrunning @TheGingerKenyan @Transvulcania Good luck, mate. And the pilot will be joining you on the party flight. #dontForgetThePony
My first in a series of articles about why I run and how I choose races. Please RT #trailteam2014
@UltraDHC @marigold_bac Been having celebratory burger afterwards. Should I be eating burgers before my run? Is that where I'm going wrong?
@naominf Nice write up. Can't believe you failed to mention the troupe of clowns at our aid station... Good luck with the next one!!
@ultrabambam Clocked 9:50 (flat), 9:27 (hilly) &amp; 13:00 (hilly) for 50 milers so far. NDW very up &amp; down but would dearly loved a PB. #sub9?!
@ultrabambam Been looking over the same myself this morning. Also, trying to give myself some sort of times to shoot for.
@JediRider Hey bud, enjoy the flight down under &amp; good luck for the @TNF100AU.
Ho ho ho. 
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning Keep the noise down, I can't decide which @TORQfitness gels I want.
@J0ERUNS @UltraDHC There were reports alleging that it was the the b*stard offspring of a wayward toddler &amp; a GIANT chicken.
@J0ERUNS You forgot, "I arrived in Abingdon, looking to be inspired by @UltraDHC but he was having a massive poo ... his 2nd of the night."
@RewRunner @UltraDHC Coffee, pizza, fridge cake and chicken.
@TheGingerKenyan @stupid_runner @JulesCRoberts Or ride your pony...
@J0ERUNS @MartinBushell1 @jonah1975 Wowsers!! Utter madness!!
@J0ERUNS @MartinBushell1 @jonah1975 WTF?! Where was that?!
@stupid_runner @imoutrunning That's a bit harsh, Cat.
@stupid_runner @imoutrunning C'mon, Sam, you can't leave it all to the last minute.
#JUSTINLIVES ...100s of people lining the towpath, motivational banner draped on the bridge also. I swear some of them had waited since 3am.
#JUSTINLIVES Justin runs 100 miles. Blog c/o @AbingdonBlog Never seen such a crowd for an ultra runner... 
@ultrareluctant I won the #UTMB last year.
@ultrareluctant Too harsh? Too blunt?
@ultrareluctant No.
@UltraDHC I'll buy a blasted Garmin!!
@Peter948 Glad you enjoyed the hospitality &amp; again, kudos for the finish. It's as much a blur for us at times as I guess it is for you.
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @Peter948 And that was before he jumped in to the car in search of a palatial loo.
@J0ERUNS @UltraDHC @imoutrunning #logBlog
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning You should blog about it.
@imoutrunning If ultra runners aren't having a poo, they're talking about it. Possibly blackened toe nails and chaffage also.
@imoutrunning Well, it's more concise than I'm used to but it's pretty much the same so far as content goes.
@imoutrunning I'm still waiting for your pacer's blog.
@samcsweeney We were away in a cottage in North Wales last week. Someone had left Home Alone 3 in the DVD player. #wheresTheCulkin?
@samcsweeney Aren't you about 8 months too early?
@MattDunnRun @UltraAvon @UltraDHC We would've probably made something up. Still laughing over "You're not ready for this jelly."
@jamesradams @imoutrunning Don't you need to have run Spartathlon another 2-3 times so that you have enough material for your next book?
@UltraBevo When you hit the dark times, now just know that you can finish the b*stard. That first one is the clincher.
@naominf Don't ask yourself, "Why?" Ask yourself, "Why not?"
@naominf Do you miss it? Well, here's the Internet, which is full of lots more online race entries.
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 That's what I said!! "You're going by GPS?!", before I fell into the river guffawing.
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 ...if his grumbling didn't slow him down &amp; he actually got there.  :-)
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 I thought ultra runners, getting lost aside, appreciated the bonus miles.  :-)  Just referred him to the RD...
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 He'd run 94 miles by Abingdon &amp; wanted us to move the finish 3 miles nearer to him along the Thames.
@UltraBevo @starterfour10 All queries regarding GPS inaccuracies should be referred to runner #109, who quibbled it at our CP.
@UltraDHC @UltraBevo I thought all those people were there for #Justin?! There were enough for 3 runners &amp; all of the volunteers.
@starterfour10 You are leading the charge, aren't you? It wouldn't be very "Susie Chan" if you weren't...  ;-)  #machine
“@sharmanian: After a few days of low motivation, today's run reminded me we're all only one good run away from feeling great again.” Agreed
@RewRunner Don't fear the cows... They get very territorial over the stiles following CP1.
@JediRider Cheers, mate. Not really sure why I started but then I couldn't stop. Probably just following @LondonNici72's fine example.
@LondonNici72 Thanks for co-ordinating the volunteering. Had an awesome time &amp; am looking forward to more of the same at #W100. #youRock
Twitter. This weekend, you have rocked.
@yellowkipper @toks Honestly, probably not the best to give advice. Learn what works for you... kit-wise, nutritionally &amp; physically.
@imoutrunning Likewise. Well done for today, you are a master of your craft.  :-)
@naominf No worries. You beasted #TP100. Very much in awe of how "with it" you looked when passing through our aid station.
@loobylins Thanks. Apologies for the lack of cake. Sadly, the Mrs tried to bake it &amp; eat it while I was helping poor souls along the course.
@grantosvernon I think I learnt that this weekend. It's great wanting to run ultras, it's way more fun not being certain of the result.
@RaversRTW Don't fear the Paris Marathon, it's A-G-E-S away!!
@RaversRTW You've changed..........
@UltraDHC @imoutrunning @ultra_ewan Time to miss the Caterham aid station and chase that elusive DQ!!
@imoutrunning @UltraDHC Coffee. Pizza. Coke. Chocolate. Everything was spiked. #noEscapeFromThePooChicken
@littlerunnergal Only volunteering at #TP100 this year but running's running. Always treasure it. #love10Ks
Has spent this evening muttering, "You're not ready for this jelly" and laughing about it. Thanks @Coxwolds
@UltraDHC Cheers for the aid station also. Surprised myself by enjoying it far more when standing idly in the cold than I thought I would.
@UltraDHC Likewise. Enjoyed yesterday's Thames jaunt. Plenty more trails around Abingdon to explore if you're about. Ta for GPX data.
@naominf @UltraDHC I was having the time of my life. The runners were awesome. I only regret not driving to the finish once we'd packed up.
Still catching up with Twitter today. #TP100 has been immense!! It's everywhere &amp; so happy to have been part of it.
@naominf Bloody strong &amp; focused through CP12. Looked like a seasoned pro.
@ogeerunner @starterfour10 @UltraDHC @imoutrunning @J0ERUNS Justin is the world's finest long distance running postman! #iBelieveInRoyalMail
@starterfour10 @UltraDHC @ogeerunner @imoutrunning @J0ERUNS #JUSTINLIVES
@ultrareluctant @UltraDHC Crashed out. Feel better now. #TorqGelsToTheRescue #myGarminSays103miles
@windsorAndy @UltraDHC Good effort for the first effort, mate. Next time, just keep moving, even if it's only plodding. #beRelentless
@jamie_woods @Peter948 @cow_phobic Apologies for not clocking you before, during or afterwards, Pete. Kudos for the finish AND awesome time!
@ultraperk #snotMonster Cc @UltraDHC * grunt grunt grunt *
@abradypus @GrahamCarterGC Time to plan the #ThamesPathGrudgeMatch
@abradypus @GrahamCarterGC Sorry that we didn't see you today but glad that you're still feel feeling the ultra marathon love.
@grantosvernon Sorry to hear that, mate. 67 miles is still a damn good shout though. Plan the rematch &amp; come back stronger.
@ultra_bobban Well done, bud. Little gutted to have missed out on that one but there's always next year.
@yellowkipper @toks There's a double entry for next year then...
@littlerunnergal Well done!! Yay for Sunday PBs!!
@stupid_runner Haha. Well done, mate, initially read that you got lost in the last 100 yards.
@DDFPRYCE Looked strong at mile 91 &amp; fairly with it as well. Kudos on the result.
@cooker44 26 drinks? One per lap of the park? #gettingDizzy #timeToSpew
@Xsurgeon It was brilliant. The longer we were there, the more impressed I was by those guys still moving. Good luck for next year.
@toks @jamie_woods finished #likeABoss. Details on the Centurion Running web site.
