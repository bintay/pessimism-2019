It's difficult to articulate how stupid this statement is... 
Spot on... 
Gentlemen! Treat your lady... 
Parody. 
Arguing that Scottish Labour is 'destroyed' is as misguided as characterising the SNP as the Taliban. Neither view is remotely accurate.
'You'd think Tony Blair had lost us three elections...' Alan Johnson really good on #labour, learning and rebuilding. @BBCr4today
@mstewart_23 @chrisdeerin @cstreetpartners  Thanks for coming. Grabbed a shot of you on the way out. 
Oor Gandhi, @AndrewWilsonAJW, wrote about his beloved @theSNP and its stunning triumph for @cstreetpartners: 
@euanmccolm A special moment.
@Richmond6 
@jamesmatesitv @iainmartin1 Here we go... 
@FuarachBlas Please go and enjoy yourself...
Hearing @NicolaSturgeon was applauded through @EDI_Airport. Rock star stuff. A man shouts 'gaun yersel hen'. Heady days. Well done to them.
There are some right charmers on twitter this morning. I'd be out celebrating, not roaming around shouting at strangers. Wheecht.
@Dabeach Aye, why not?
@gordy_smithy @johnmcternan Calm down and enjoy your success.
@FuarachBlas @johnmcternan Whatever you say.
Really good speech from Jim Murphy. Simple, honest stuff. #Labour
#SNP faster off the PR blocks than the others. Again. That is a machine that works bloody well. Labour: copy it.
Balls out.
Spare a small thought for the families of MPs old and new. Many lives changed tonight. Politics and public service is hard going.
Sitting out the back of @AndrewWilsonAJW's house, trying to take it all in... 
Can't wait to see what happy clappy, optimistic, cheerful gloss my mate @AndrewWilsonAJW puts on this...
So, where the f**k was MI5 today then?
. @AnneMcGuire97 teaching Ian Davidson a lesson in grace there. Class act. Anne, that is...
That f*****g rubbish panda joke lives to fight another day.
The election in Scotland: it's a bit like watching Floyd Mayweather fighting @Chris_Sibbald.
Congratulations to the SNP on a quite remarkable success. Enjoy the good times.
BREAKING: pretty much everything.
Always hated politics. Boring nonsense. Looking forward to Celtic's championship presentation. Four in a row.
Who gets to choose Paddy Ashdown's hat?
Is it too late or early for the 'Today, I was going to vote [insert one party] and then I changed my mind and voted [insert another] tweets?
@KennyFarq Brilliant Kenny. All the best.
#GE2015 has been a triumph of ambiguity and obfuscation over calm, reasoned debate and good ideas. Vote whatever way you like. Just vote.
@jp_murphy Yes, but you know what I'm saying...
@OldTownSpeed @JohannLamont What's your point?
The crusades. Billy Graham, Ally MacLeod.....Brilliant piece by Kenneth Roy of @ScottishReview: 
@John_5_1 Go for it. I think you're wrong.
@John_5_1 Not sure I follow. How can you agree 'each to their own' and describe my comments as naive?
@PheeMcPhee @RuthDavidsonMSP That's nice and clear. Thanks.
Can we all agree on one thing tomorrow? There is no single vote that can be fairly described as for or against Scotland. Each to their own.
@ruth_wishart Fair enough. Messi not quite at that level.
Messi's second goal. Right up there with Archie Gemmill.
@DA_Anderson Thanks Donald. An old favourite.
I suppose when all is said and done, #Scotland will still look utterly magnificent. 
Few people understand and care about @thesnp more than my big pal @AndrewWilsonAJW. Here he is in the @guardian: 
Some bold #GE2015 predictions here. Let the disorder begin... 
Brace yourselves... 
Down to my last Mach 3 razor. I now plan to run a beauty parade of investment banks to organise the financing of the next lot.
We tend to be right... 
Oh look, the election's taken a bit of an ugly turn in Scotland. The only unusual thing about that is that some people think it's unusual.
At three minutes and 29 seconds in this ridiculous film, Sean Clerkin says to Jose Mourinho: "Come and get me." 
The shouters' obsession with Jim Murphy is fascinating. Is there a powerful feeling of attraction at the heart of it, I wonder?
@Chris_Sibbald @chrisdeerin Man gets lost. In his pocket, he has a map of the world and Twitter. He asks Twitter for help. We're all mad.
Scotland, 2015. I am tired of people on all sides throwing insults and abuse at each other. We have an amazing history. Let's live up to it.
@AndrewWilsonAJW Good point. Must also apply to any Government elected on less than half the vote.
Enjoy with invented outrage, lazy tribalism, a Caramac and a can of Vimto. It's @AndrewWilsonAJW with some words: 
Not sure what the problem is with tactical voting. People can vote for who they want and for whatever outcome they want. Pure democracy.
Follow our man @chrisdeerin for the latest on #RoyalBabyWatchWatch. Like us all, he's on the edge of his seat.

He might be right. It has to happen eventually... 
@chrisdeerin @belindaofficial @SusannaHoffs Please stop.
I'm in the mood. 
"Remember Keir Hardie? That was the right Labour mob." Brilliant video from the @guardian 
Oh yes. 
So, 59-0 the final score then? Let's hope there's no injury time. 
More brilliance from @chrisdeerin, loved by all sides for his treachery and big words: 
If we can shift power from the corridors of Westminster to communities, presumably we can do the same from Edinburgh? #ge2015 #ELECTION2015
I wrote about the #snp and its clever balancing act: 
@JimMurgatroyd Very good!
@iaindocherty @andywightman Good grief. Full strength bampottery.
@brianspanner1 Oh. That's dead.
@chrisdeerin @rickyaross @AndrewWilsonAJW's always unhappy. Never has an uplifting, spiritual, flowery, wise, happy thing to say to anyone.
If @chrisdeerin sent a CD to everbody he upsets on Twitter, he'd need the resources of HMV at his disposal. (thanks due to @rickyross)
I liked life more when Fran and Anna would mind their Ps and Qs. 
One wonders if Los Angeles is far enough away for @BBCJamesCook. Many of his correspondents provide a masterclass in tosspottery.
In a job interview, many years from now....."Ah, yes, um, well....." 
The timeline of @JamieRoss7 is a work of art today. It is an utterly brilliant snapshot of Scottish bampottery. 
@AndrewWilsonAJW That figures.
I bought a slinky. It got tangled. I bought another. It got tangled. This short video helped. 
@MrsCupcake79 How long do you think it would keep? Always concerned these things go off.
@MrsCupcake79 Ouch. Take care.
@JamieRoss7 They'll be free by 93...
Scottish political party suspends a candidate days before a general election. Quite right too. Bold, decisive stuff. 
No contest... 
@ruth_wishart I think you know me well enough Ruth. The whole thing is tiresome. A competition of insults when it should be about ideas.
@ruth_wishart Of course. Not sure why you have to ask that question.
Well, this is depressing. What's happening in Scotland? 
@AndrewWilsonAJW Not at all. The SNP has long been an establishment party. Eight years of centralising government?
@AndrewWilsonAJW Yours is a big party.
There comes a time when an example should be made of these keyboard warriors. Not good enough to look the other way. 
I honestly didn't know of this phenomenon... 
Parole after 250 years perhaps? 
@LJ_Skipper You got a wee obsession Luke?
Amazeballs, as the kids say... 
@SkynyrdScotland Thanks Iain.
Shades (of Gigha, Kintyre and Arran) by me:

@jp_murphy An undervalued word.
Blimey, there are still people who are using twitter as a measure of sentiment around the #BBCDebate.
I'm very proud of @chrisdeerin tonight. Whether you agree with him or not (I do, always), his is a ridiculous talent. Columnist of the year.
@euanmccolm Poor Andrew.
@AndrewWilsonAJW @chrisdeerin @cstreetpartners You ran out of space before you could type "...writing about flowers and birds and things."
@Bruichladdich And from the other side... 
I've just been for a run. The absurdity of that statement is nearly matched by what I could see. 
@mjbecher Just a little...
Machir Bay on #Islay today. 
This '75% of Labour candidates oppose Trident' line - is it true that only 12% of candidates responded to the survey? New politics? Mmm.
Read @chrisdeerin on British politics. It's always a good use of time: 
Roy Keane, speaking on ITV: "In my view, that's a minor stamp." Players must try harder.

@MhairiHunter @CairneyPaul Ok. Can you elaborate?
@arthurmacmillan Challenge the prevailing view and get told 'you don't get it'. Tiresome.
Not sure I believe all this new politics stuff now. Heard it all before. Politics is the same as ever. Just some new, loud participants.

@jp_murphy @chrisdeerin Hahahaha.
The call to ignore online smearing and defamatory abuse is tiresome. Expose and challenge every time. Every disease requires treatment.
@chrisdeerin @Ramsay59 @ColinBEdgar So I was just thinking...dreaming actually...where now for the Scottish Tories?
'I loved Tony Hart so much, yet completely failed to notice him die in 2009'. Some of the Twitterati are excelling themselves this morning.

The wiser parts of Scotland's new establishment know that there is now a real competition in Scottish politics. Policy before process.

Love this old @pressassoc picture of old-fashioned football men. Jock Stein and Sean Fallon. 
A picture emerges of the Hampden pitch preparations. 
People who say that Andy Murray is Scottish when he loses and British when he wins are as imaginative as the people who shout 'Come on Tim'.
@jasperkitten Maybe so. But Djokovic should be forced to explain himself.
I hope somebody has the courage to interrogate Djokovic on the limping and hobbling when he was second best. There's nothing wrong with him.
Artist's impression of Djokovic after his next bad game... 
Jose Mourinho's been coaching Djokovic. #diver
Kim Sears' t-shirt should keep the chattering classes busy...after they've been on Google to find out who she is. 
@LillyLyle Laughed at that. Thanks.
The animosity towards Jim Murphy is largely because he's forcing an uncomfortable debate about policy; putting process where it belongs.

@BraidenHT @Summito Yes, of course. But council tax freeze is a political choice that reduces money available to provide public services.

The council tax freeze costs Scotland £2.5bn. Meanwhile, class sizes grow and teacher numbers fall. Nothing. To. Do. With. Westminster.

@TerryMurden1 Ok, Terry. Nothing's changed. Jeezo.
@TerryMurden1 "Not changing anything" Seriously? We have a political class, now completely consumed by process, failing the poorest.
@TerryMurden1 There is power to make real change now, and more to come. It's all about motivation. Some people don't want to use powers.
@TerryMurden1 A "sham" that five parties agreed to?
In marketing terms, there is a huge gap in the Scottish politics market for a party that puts policy before process. Time to be serious.
Scotland moving on from constitutional obsessing? Fat chance. Too many careers depend on the navel gazing.
As young Hamish reads his book, I am reminded of the People's Vow. 
When you see the words 'new inclusive style of politics', bear in mind that means 'exactly the same tiresome style of politics'.

@euanmccolm Vow that's what I call constitutional navel gazing. Volume 376.
To be fair, if you're in politics for the process and not the policy, today was never going to be enough. Maybe one day...
The Scottish people are smart enough to make their own judgements on the Smith Commission. The political games are patronising now.

@Chris_Sibbald What?
Scotland have the same number of points as the World Cup holders after four games. We have a dream.
Broonie. Assist of the century. What a finish...
The treatment of Aiden McGeady tonight is depressing. Maybe we should hold a summit.

I'm pretty confident Scotland won't vote for independence in my lifetime.

Another day, another brilliant Matt cartoon in the @telegraph 
Heartbreaking, but inspiring. That was @GordonAikman at @MNDScotland Downing St reception with Samantha Cameron. 
All this nonsense about whether Scottish Labour leader should be MP or MSP. How about just selecting somebody who *might* win an election?
@alexmassie Yes, of course.
@alexmassie Interesting piece Alex. Process chatter has to give way to policy soon...
The sky didn't look like this when I left Scotland. Might we have further devolution of meteorological power?

London you're a lady, said the magnificent Shane MacGowan. A beautiful one too. Good morning to you. 
Remember, remember. Matt. 
If you can access it, @alexmassie has written a compelling piece on Scotland's education in @thetimes 
He's one of the best young writers I have the good fortune to know. @chrisdeerin on a new Scottish enlightenment: 
Read this by @DaniGaravelli1 on the daft (my word) politics of food banks 
Winter's coming... 
@LapGongLeong Yes, they need to decentralise. It's fair to say that.
@LapGongLeong In the Scottish Government's referendum, 55% of Scots voted to remain in the UK. I assume you refer to one opinion poll.
Just imagine the synthetic outrage if Miliband had *not* included Scottish stuff in his food bank donation... 
If we ever agree on new powers for Scotland, the poor constitutional navel gazing industry will surely be decimated.
Another whole interview on Scotland with little or no time for policy. Process rules. #marr
I used to think Alan Rough was the greatest goalie in the world. Those were the days. 
@Cat_Headley @Channel4News Bless him and his embarrassing, incoherent view.

That faint cheer that could be heard in Scotland late last night? It's been traced to a small residential flat in Downing Street, London.

@AndrewWilsonAJW I could send one in a taxi, but the cost of that would be similar to Mel Gibson hand delivering one tonight.

The quality of leadership and debate has slipped. Please read @AndrewWilsonAJW's letter to the losers. 
Breaking: Cup Finals will now be replayed the following day, and each day thereafter, if the runner up came within ten goals of the winner.
@Bob_Orr @GerryBraiden @Leasky My view is no further referendum for at least ten years. A significant majority voted against.
@FragrantRouge Chin up mate. You fought a tremendous fight.
@FragrantRouge I hope so. We need strong, unifying leadership soon. It's not here today.
"Only the over 55s support No", says a random. Not true. People of all ages and backgrounds voted No. The majority of Scots did, in fact.

It says a lot about Twitter and #indyref when tweets with broken links are retweeted many times. 
Beautiful war memorial on Whitehall this morning. Farewell London. See you on the other side. #indyref 
After a short visit to the heart of the Empire, it will be good to be back in Scotland. 
@HelenMilburn @chrisdeerin @AndrewWilsonAJW They did not. Hoovers.
@chrisdeerin @HelenMilburn @AndrewWilsonAJW I looked into his eyes once. Bond yields compressed and the price of everything went up.
Few places reinforce the bond between Scotland and England more than Corby. Here's the local paper. #indyref 
Beckham. Unprecedented. Matt. 
@AndrewWilsonAJW @murrayf00te @alextomo The Bills are I alive with the sound of losing. #VoteNo
@GNev2 Beckham. Wimbledon. Half way line. Scottish goalie.

@RuthDavidsonMSP @colinmccredie @chrisdeerin @GaryLineker @IamWillieThorne I met him in the casino in Monte Carlo. Head to toe in white.
@AndrewWilsonAJW Is it white and made of paper?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, no, no. 
You know it's knitwear season when @AndrewWilsonAJW puts on his best suit. 
@AndrewWilsonAJW Ah, found it. It was under your spelling book.
@AndrewWilsonAJW I need to borrow your airbrush.
It's difficult not to feel sadness as I read this of a beloved place. Divided Scotland. #islay #indyref @nytimes 
A fairer, kinder, more positive Scotland there...

@AndrewWilsonAJW You used the words 'hip hop combo' in a public place? FFS. Never mind all that indie nonsense, this is *devastating*.
This referendum thing? We've already been through that. We nearly tore our country apart. Twice.

@lawrencedonegan Heard it all before Lawrence.
This 'hope over fear' line would be a better one if it wasn't complete bollocks. #indyref
The best possible reaction to the #bbcbias protest would be to put those half wits at the top of every news bulletin for a week. #indyref
First time in a while that I've felt comfortable in my own divided country. Emotional times. #indyref 
Reflecting. It's shameful how little Holyrood has done for poor and disadvantaged people in recent years. Who's in running the bloody place?
Marvellous effort by MI5 with yon #bbcbias #indyref thing. Mon the spooks.
Grange Cricket Club down for swift nationalisation. Putting North Edinburgh sports administration closer the people. 
Have a look at this for a live example of an invigorating, enlightening #indyref debate: 
@jp_murphy I don't have a strong enough signal.
@andrewpicken1 @Sunday_Post It's optimistic to think your critics will actually have taken the time to read the opinion!

@alexmassie @Freedland Not silent Alex. Quiet?
That biased London establishment is at it again. Oh, hang on.... 
Word of the (#indyref) day so far: patronise.
Still a good measure of gratuitous personal abuse flying around. I was always taught that people in glass houses should not throw stones.
Heard an amazing and worrying story about #indyref voting today.
Scotland: the only polls that count. 

@jp_murphy ...and proud.
@jp_murphy I can't disagree, but I really want to for the purposes of completing this exchange satisfactorily.
@jp_murphy Showing a healthy self-awareness there JP.
@jp_murphy Thanks for the reminder. Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no....

I look at 100s of comments on an #indyref article. The most constructive is an offer to work from home with Google, and earn $7,778 a month.
@benrileysmith Shouldn't be too surprised. Yes went negative weeks ago, and will continue to be so. Depressing though.
People in suburban Edinburgh shouting treason. Temperatures in the 20s, in September. And Efe Ambrose scores with his foot. Strange days.
@C_KAndrews Great piece.
Some of our most senior leaders should read this, by @C_KAndrews 
@jp_murphy Don't be daft JP. My wife was called a traitor six times this morning. I'm sick of the whole thing.
In South Edinburgh? Beware of an angry lady who seems to have a problem with treason and England. Approach with care. May argue badly.
If you're near Glasgow on Monday, I can't recommend the @georgegalloway and Brian Wilson show enough. Details here....
The irony of Jim Sillars' day of reckoning nonsense is that there will be one, but it won't be for BP or the banks. #indyref
Great political rally at Usher Hall. Well played @georgegalloway Brian Wilson, Ronald Macdonald, @ProfTomkins and @dannyalexander #indyref
Gordon Brown,Usher Hall: there is not a battlefield in Europe on which the Scots, English, Welsh and Irish did not fight together. #indyref
A former miner stand up at the Usher Hall. Close to tears, he talks of the solidarity across the UK in his old industry. Powerful. #indyref
Sharp, intelligent, sobering, stirring speech for the UK, from @ProfTomkins in the Usher Hall. #indyref
Leaking. Sensitive. Information. Glass. Houses. Throw. Stones. Don't...
Powerful, passionate speech for the union, by Brian Wilson at the Usher Hall. Class act. #indyref
There seems to be a marked increase in instances of treason in Scotland. Should we hold a summit and maybe introduce a bill? #indyref
Beautiful #edinburgh skyline. 
@iainmartin1 @AlanRoden Morningside pensioner to boycott John Lewis. Sensational.

Can it really be true that some hard politics are being played in #indyref? That seems frightfully unfair.
Looks healthy enough to me MT @ScottishSun: DEAD LION found in a UK restaurant's freezer... 
Hey, @cstreetdugs, why does @AndrewWilsonAJW have the only iphone in the world that doesn't focus?

London. A magnificent city at the heart of a great country. 
In London, there's real, touching concern that Scotland may be about to leave the UK. My emotions running riot. #indyref
Remember, the only #indyref poll that matters is the one that says what you want it to say.
Dropped @AndrewWilsonAJW off in Trafalgar Square this morning. 
@AndrewWilsonAJW @chrisdeerin Order English breakfast tea (to use as currency) and let the dogs 'relax' on the yoga mat please.
@chrisdeerin Did you manage to fit that ejector seat beneath @AndrewWilsonAJW's chair?
Beautiful but quiet morning in London. Where *is* everyone? #scotland 
Who thought it a good idea to have the World Platitude Recital Championships in Scotland at the same time as the closing week of #indyref?
Aim for the stars, says the royal astronomer in Viz. 
@chrisdeerin @AndrewWilsonAJW collage.
Soon, an opinion poll will show that some people like a thing and others don't. Please proceed carefully through the looking glass. #indyref
A currency union will always be the preferred option of those who wish to forever blame London for the bad things that happen. #indyref
@AndrewWilsonAJW @benrileysmith @murdo_fraser Very good.
@AndrewWilsonAJW @benrileysmith @murdo_fraser There are some centralists in Edinburgh too, no?
@LeckieBill I wrote thrashed first. Then walloped. Nothing works.
@LeckieBill Magic. I'll try that before I beat the weans tonight.
@LeckieBill What, you get cheat codes on Fifa? Where?
Oh no. 50:50 in #indyref. How do we settle it if it's a bloody draw? I'm going for a one-off game of #FIFA15. Neither team can have Messi.
The Royal Baby announcement did not go exactly to plan, as three Scottish conspiracy theorists turned up.... 
@HelenMilburn Hunners of them. Optimism is overrated.
Ladies and gentlemen: if you want to make up a third party opinion on #indyref, that is exactly the same as yours, use a taxi driver.
@schofieldkevin You might also need this... 
Ach, I can't believe Westminster allowed Muller that chance. #SCOvGER
Of all the depressing aspects of #indyref, the airbrushing of the existing Scottish Parliament and how it came about must rank high.
@Robbill123 @AnneMcGuireMP You underline my point. Thanks.
Whatever the outcome of the vote, the dividing line in Scotland will be deep and it's been a bruising two years for some. Time for maturity.
In the next 11 days, Scotland's political leadership can set the tone for a difficult period post #indyref? Are they willing or capable?
Happy afternoon at Celtic Park raising money for good causes in the company of McStay, Scholes, Zola and...McAvennie. 
@ruth_wishart So you'd sit out a second constitutional convention in the event of a No?
At #Celtic Park, in the company of Louis from @onedirection. I've not heard screaming like that here since John Barnes was the manager.
Magnificent RT @oldpicsarchive: Man With Big Mustache 
@Leasky @holyroodmandy He's like the Sally Jockstrap of politics...
@FragrantRouge That's pretty much what I said out loud. My boys looked puzzled.
@FragrantRouge I drove past a Skoda Roomster today, and thought of you and Gerry.
@Squirreltower @AndrewWilsonAJW I agree politics is changing, but I also see old-fashioned campaigning tactics at work.
@FragrantRouge F**k, I agree with that.
@Squirreltower Non.
Let the celebrations begin (as they will). Fascinating poll. Going negative late seems to be working. #indyref
Twitter will nearly break tonight on #indyref, and the other 90% of the electorate is also expected to give it all some thought.
Quiet night in Fairmilehead. Doesn't hurt at all. 
Not so many retweets of @rupertmurdoch line about disillusion leaving opportunities for the far left. See and hear what we want to, I guess.
If Murdoch poll puts Yes ahead, watch the celebrations begin. #indyref
One flight a day. What is the point? 
.@jk_rowling tries to have a measured conversation about #Indyref. Accused of using her money to keep children in poverty. #invigorating
I suspect @murrayf00te's timeline will be a good deal spicier today than it was yesterday. Such a brief, intense love affair it was...
@Freedland @chrisdeerin @AndrewWilsonAJW I repent, of course. It is time for us to vote, before we start killing each other.

#indyref

@chrisdeerin @AndrewWilsonAJW @Freedland And he didn't leave George Street? Let's go off the beaten path, for the real debate?

Mon then.

One of the most depressing features of #indyref is the wilful misrepresentation of the Scottish Parliament as impotent. It is not true.
@chrisdeerin @claireehowell Haha - @crazih0rse can...
Another night, another debate in which some people would have us believe the Scottish Parliament has little or no power. Depressing stuff.

Great day @archerfieldgolf raising money for @BarnardosScot. Congratulations to @realdavekerr for best golf and best trousers.

Still undecided I'm afraid. 
Elaine C Smith says "the people" delivered the Scottish Parliament. Not *all* the people though, eh? #ScotDecides #indyref
@AndrewWilsonAJW @claireehowell The debate on twitter bears little resemblance to the telly one, but it's often funnier.
@Squirreltower Health and education. Would they be great powers?
An outsider looking in at these #indyref debates could be forgiven for thinking the Scottish Parliament has no powers at all. #ScotDecides

If there's one thing that beats #indyref for the amount of mince written about it on here, it is surely #transferdeadlineday.
@jp_murphy Gandhi's influence is getting to me. I had more than one optimistic thought today.
@ChrisMaguire78 Of course. An outbreak of common sense is surely required.
I can barely look at the Ashya King story. How on earth can he be parted from his mum and dad now? Come on Spain. Behave yourselves.
Only two YES hours before the MOMENTUM transfer window NO slams shut on the dramatic UNDECIDEDS. Stay on Twitter for more clichés.
Remember the only poll that counts is the one being rigged by Bodie and Doyle, the geography master at Eton and Helen Mirren. #indyref

@murrayf00te Double percentage points for red trousers, and treble for men called Tarquin.
I think it's around this time that the head of MI5 meets David Icke and Prince Philip to decide the exact percentages in #indyref.
@jp_murphy @russellwardrop I once lamented the lack of satire in this campaign. It's there now, for sure.
A person writes: "if you're undecided on #indyref, look at the Pentlands", where there is a big white Yes on the side of a hill. Sake, man.
@murrayf00te @AndrewWilsonAJW You should have seen him dictating it to his personal copy-taker. Like Liberace, with more of a flourish.
