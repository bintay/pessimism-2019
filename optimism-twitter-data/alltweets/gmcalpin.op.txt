iOS always wants to change "people" to "peyote." My life isn't THAT interesting, Apple.
@Mchuman fair enough. I want to murder people when I see them trot out the same dumb arguments with every Kickstarter project ever.
@Mchuman from what I have heard about Archie, there is zero chance they could hire Adam Hughes on their usual rates. Zero.
@Mchuman Don't like it, don't pledge. It's a pretty simple proposition.
@Mchuman I've seen a little of it. I've heard the "these people shouldn't need Kickstarter" argument before from people who are morons.
@Mchuman i love Archie
@jessiesarah "Relax. I've got this."
@jessiesarah yeah, I saw Brad Bird tweet about those the other day. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
@joeandmonkey eh
@jessiesarah I guess you're right. I just thought it was a given that they would never do a second one without him.
(Meaning I never read the later ones, not that I don't think they were good)
All the old He-Man minicomics are being collected. So much better than the cartoon (at least the early ones were)! 
I didn't realize him working on Incredibles 2 was news, but how great would a Brad Bird Star Wars be?

@johnkiggins strange! Just checked and didn't have any issue this time, so I dunno.
@EvilLiberalPig I'm not sure if that was what affected me. Whatever it was, I'm back. Thanks, though!
Ah, Facebook didn't disable me. It was just some network weirdness from being on the road.

@pipedreamcomics I've only read the first trade of that but could follow along fine, except for a few moments of
@pipedreamcomics that's fair, because you basically did. Hickman's New Avengers sets most of it up.
@zayasman just peppering their language with a couple of stock phrases from Russian (Colossus) or whatever.
@zayasman Que chévere might be easy to work in. I worry about coming off like the Chris Claremont school of writing a multi-cultural cast:
@pipedreamcomics if you want boring and inaccessible, look at Convergence! I thought Secret Wars #1 was fun. The FF stuff was great.
@pipedreamcomics i disagree, though i am semi-familiar w/ some recent events it builds from. but these crossovers are never casual friendly.
@mikedoeslife like Kurt and Jason's t-shirts and (rarely) winter coats and such.
@mikedoeslife seriously, though, they all have basically two outfits: on- &amp; off-duty. This is her off-duty. Some of the main cast have more.

Actually, maybe it's tied with Kaijumax #1. What is in the water over at Big Time Attic?
I keep forgetting to say this: The Cartoon Introduction to Philosphy is the best comic book I've read all year. 
@southworth They could call it Black SHEep. thank you I'll take my Oscar now
@southworth No, I don't think so either. Though comedy movies are generally more crass and aggressive now than when Farley was around, too
@southworth — I just think you might have a slightly sanitized memory of Farley's career. :)
@southworth I like her in what I've seen (which isn't much; the trailers for Spy and The Heat make/made me cringe for other reasons) —
@southworth Her schtick is often much more aggressive than his though. I don't think you can totally dismiss any qualitative difference.
@southworth I don't mean to argue that there isn't some misogyny in how much fanboys hate her. Of course there is.
@southworth Acting?
@southworth Farley died before he could make too many more Beverly Hills Ninjas. McCarthy has starred in a couple of those already.
@southworth In Bridesmaids and in St. Vincent (which was her getting out of her usual schtick in a Bill Murray indie no one watched).
@southworth He's dead?
@southworth Chris Farley was pretty well maligned for most of his roles, too, the way I remember it.

@Rosscott Their shitty Illustrator skills clearly do not do the same.
@trevoramueller Even if it weren't a single take, the choreography was smooth &amp; tight. None of their other action has been nearly that good.
@trevoramueller But yeah, Daredevil is so much better it's insulting to DD to even compare them. I still thought that sequence as well done.
@trevoramueller They couldn't possibly have gotten the idea from Daredevil. They aired too close. Besides, Daredevil got it from Oldboy.

@Iron_Spike How is it that you are constantly finding examples of THE worst humanity has to offer? I hope it's all research for something.
I'm a very optimistic, hopeful person. If I come across as a curmudgeonly prick it's because you lot are such a constant disappointment.
@trevoramueller How good was that action sequence with Skye in the previous episode?! Fifteen seconds of greatness in the last… how long?
Ugh…Agents of Making It Up As We Go continues to flirt with the idea of being good and then fail miserably. why do I keep watching this shit
@tropicalsteve Ah, got it. Sorry! Yeah, it was a bad client (I have an iPhone now) but they effectively crippled all third party apps, so…

@tropicalsteve Then try 
@CodeCloak I do, a bit. :) more movie news than comics but still. I've heard retailers say 100% wrong stuff more times than i can count.
@tropicalsteve TweetDeck, or at least the browser version.
@CodeCloak (retailers read the same news sites we do, is all I mean.)
@CodeCloak I wouldn't know any better than him. But... That's my point. yeah, they don't know any better than us about this stuff.
@CodeCloak And very few people who write and draw their titles work in their offices. The move barely affects creators.
@CodeCloak That doesn't make sense. Organizing Convergence has to be more work editorially than just continuing regular titles, not less.
@AgainstClint I absolutely think so, but if you aren't vaguely familiar with some of Hickman's Avengers run, you may get a little lost.
@deantrippe issue 1 was amazing. Hickman is firing on all cylinders. I hope you sell a boatload.
Almost every Convergence book I've read has looked hastily slapped together. (Doc Shaner's Captain Marvel issue being a notable exception.)
Secret Wars #1 is everything DC's Convergence isn't: exciting, heroic, and beautifully illustrated. R.I.P. Marvel Universe.

@TheOnlyTrout That and the whole "real SHIELD" arc don't really make sense. I just want them to move past all that drivel.

@me3dia Related note, my thesis project includes images (and links to archives) with my sources in context. But I include a transcript, too.

@andthankyou I want to! With the four basic shots set up from that, I should be able to crank another one out relatively quickly.
Alternately, if you replace "solve crimes" with "talk forever about movies," you get Multiplex.

@WebcomicsAreBad haha, yeah. He had some great lines.
@WebcomicsAreBad I would've liked something closer to Evil Spock than Beep Borp but "it's not how I would have done it" isn't a complaint.
@WebcomicsAreBad yeah? I dunno. I think it stands up to scrutiny as will as most superhero comics, but i still enjoyed it.

@jessiesarah please do! Or hit me on IM sometimes. sometimes I find just trying to explain what I'm stuck on helps me figure it out.
@jessiesarah Comic strips are different, of course. If Multiplex were a serialized graphic novel, I would do things completely differently.
@jessiesarah what I'd say is, figure out what your point is then chuck anything and everything that does not push the story forward to that.
@jessiesarah i would gladly read anything you have roughed out so far, if my opinion is worth anything to you. :) but essentially...

@southworth Right? Peter Weir realized the story was done the second he left and decided to end it there instead. And it was brilliant.

This looks like a step up from the earlier HTTYD animated show. 
@larsbalker Miller?
@southworth I think it will be (slightly) lighter in tone, and I'm fine with that. Foggy was funny as hell when he wasn't super sad.
@southworth He left for Sinister Six (which is DOA), but is (rumored to be) in the running for taking over the re-reboot of Spider-Man.
@southworth I think as the show progressed, you got less of Goddard's fingerprints and more of DeKnight's.
@southworth Steven DeKnight (the showrunner and director of that episode) did Spartacus, after all.
@southworth But … enh. We got a mostly very solid 13 hour origin story. No other superhero has had that.
@southworth Yeah, if they had ramped up his acrobatics &amp; intro'd the costume a little earlier, it would have seemed less abrupt.
@southworth It kind of does. That was definitely one of the weaker episodes. The fact that it was by the showrunner is… worrying.
@southworth The whole last half of the season was a step down from the first half, sure. But it was still the best superhero TV show yet.
Let's complain that there isn't enough levity in second and third acts of a show about a vigilante facing off against a brutal mob lord.
Yes, let's complain about the costume that appears for like ten minutes and is EXPLICITLY described as unfinished.

@MikeCohodes orphan black's pilot was pretty brilliant, though. That was way more of a headfuck, hard to compare.
@MikeCohodes Never seen The Shield. Thought it was better than Lost's but that show didn't hook me.
Great dialogue, tight pacing, terrific teases for what's to come, and awesome fight choreography. I wish I didn't have to go to class today.
The first episode of Daredevil is the best superhero pilot ever — and one of the best first episodes of any TV show I've seen in any genre
@joeandmonkey I'm only fifteen minutes in and I completely agree. Really hating the fact that I have class this morning.

Multiplex #1009: Let the Joyous News Be Spread! 
Felt like putting up tomorrow's strip early so… 
I love how Maya will select something that you clicked a full inch away from rather than the !@#$ !@#$@#$! thing you actually clicked on.
@larsbalker Haha. Not that that's saying much.
@larsbalker In any case, it looks a lot better there than the leaked banner image. That was a strange angle of an already strange face.
@larsbalker Yeah, it's not perfect, but it can change if there's a sequel. Let's just hope the movie is good enough to warrant one.
You know you want to look at Jamie Bell’s Thing 
@briantruitt I thought it was just planned as a one-time series?
I feel so much better about being 40 now. 

Interesting. — Lionsgate Launches Subscription On Demand Service With Comic-Con International 
@hkeller812 as a longtime Apple taxpayer i think $30 sounds more their usual markup but the exact lineup of channels would make a difference
@jessiesarah I think it looks fun :(
@Rosscott trademark attribution statements
@hkeller812 (I already have Hulu Plus.) It makes more sense to buy the Better Call Saul season pass for me.
@hkeller812 I've already got an Apple TV (and both iDevices), though. And the only one in Sling's package I'd watch is AMC —
@Mchuman yyyyuuuup
@Mchuman If only it WERE actually à la carte! But most of the networks wouldn't go for that, I'm sure.
Apple's TV plan sounds too big. I don't want 25 channels for $30–40 a month. I'd rather take the five I'll watch for $10 a month.

Multiplex #1008: End of an Era, Part Five 
@AppleScrander obviously. but what I said was that they are ONLY references, NOT jokes (as well as references).
.@jacksonferrell see, it's funny because most webcomics about video games are just references and not actual jokes.
.@jacksonferrell okay here is an idea for a webcomic joke about video games: Mario
@jacksonferrell I use better grammar than that, DUMMY
@larsbalker NO! I played the shit out of Dynasty Warriors on my brother's N64 like 15 years ago or whatever. i used to be cool
Hey guys, I got a video game joke!
@rosalarian I love my family better from afar, too.

@angelamelick they back it just to support the strip, not to get the exclusive stuff
@angelamelick i post very little new stuff to Patreon because of grad school. Very few people cancel
@angelamelick set it per strip then!
@me3dia Probably a squatter, too. :1
@FSugino thanks!

Multiplex #1007: End of an Era, Part Four 
@joedunn721 They really need to use John Stewart. It would totally sidestep any issues with the first movie. Also, Hal Jordan sucks.

How to get a cartoonist to ignore you in one easy step: Critique the grammar of one of their fictional characters.
@KevSaund as goofy as that is, that would be the least fucked up way to explain it. But they definitely never suggested that's what it is.
Also, how do they get food and water? How do they bathe? Where do they take a shit? Who does their laundry?
The Flash imprisoning people in tiny cells with no due process is Fucked Up if you think about it. Why don't shows' writers do that more?
@MatubSDMF Hopefully there's nothing in USB-C that will make it stupid expensive. Thunderbolt has all kinds of circuitry in its cables.
@MatubSDMF My TB cable is 1 foot long and probably still cost $30. haha. But yeah, Monoprice is the fucken shit for that stuff.
@southworth trigger warning
@MatubSDMF You're not gonna use a Thunderbolt mouse or anything like that, you know? It was born to be used for hubs.
@MatubSDMF —and a TB dock with a mess of shit plugged into it (including two USB hubs). It's a mess, but it's so convenient. :)
@MatubSDMF Understandable. I do think people who hate Apple (&amp; don't realize it's Intel's) tend to overstate the costs. I have one TB cable—
@MatubSDMF Of course, USB-C would eliminate that power cable, too. But my late 2015 MBP isn't getting replaced any time soon.
@MatubSDMF It's pricey, sure, but I can hook my laptop up to EVERYTHING with one cable (plus power) when I get home. I love that so much.
@MatubSDMF I'm pro-Thunderbolt, but USB-C will probably eat its lunch for all but really high-end stuff. Which is fine by me.
@MatubSDMF But that's probably more important for the 13" ones that are supposed to be portable(-ish).
@MatubSDMF Also, I think USB-C or Thunderbolt would really improve them. Their connector is clunnnkkkkyyyyy.
@MatubSDMF For sure, it is a thing of beauty.
@MatubSDMF I really think, though, that if you're drawing on the screen, it should be a real, high-res (215+ ppi) screen.
@MatubSDMF That one is respectable (2560 x 1440, 97% Adobe RGB) but way out of my budget. Not that I can even afford the 22".
@brandonjcarr If that is accurate and you did it from memory, I am VERY impressed.
One of the main reasons I hesitate to get a Cintiq is the screens: 1920x1080 res &amp; a pathetic 72% Adobe RGB gamut on a 22" screen? Really?!
@brandonjcarr If Perfect Strangers comes back, we will do the dance of joy!
@roopjm I haven't! Should be fixed now. Thank you!
@kelli217 I'm aware, but they've also drifted to having black dudes as Klingons -- the angry, warmongers -- since TNG, almost as a default.
@zayasman Oh, totally. Orci is a hack.
@zayasman Yeah, that gives me some hope, though a straight (mostly dramatic) movie is a bit of a change of pace for him, so…?
@CodeCloak …yeahhhh. the rest looks fine! but the face.
@zayasman That's obviously an oversimplification for how they're depicted, but you know what I mean.
@zayasman I just don't like that black dudes seem to have turned into the go-to for the "vaguely evil war-obsessed race." Y'know?
Not bad, but… enh — The Thing Revealed in International Banner for Fantastic Four

@brandonjcarr oh, poor white people, having to deal with the demographic of the country changing.
@rosalarian do you have an ios device? The Yahoo Screen app works alright.
@brandonjcarr "too much of a good thing"? what?
@rosamundlannin I'm just saying, I have a huge boner for Mr. Darcy is all.
@rosamundlannin because that's where the Mr. Darcy fixation really comes from, not the book. also, it's terrific, so watch it.
@rosamundlannin you're watching the BBC version with Colin Firth?
@jellybeansoup If you were a good editor, you could do it in one.

@rosalarian Would you be interested in writing something for me to draw when Fresh Romance starts taking pitches?
@gimpnelly I don't think you need that "if/". :)
@gimpnelly i love the Fresh Romance concept and just backed it. Is there any info about where and how to pitch a story for future issues?
I just backed Fresh Romance - An Ongoing Romance Comics Anthology Magazine on @Kickstarter 

@ObscureGent That is hardly bullying, man. He called you out on an arguably misleading, irresponsible strip. Disagree &amp; move on or listen.
@RobStenzinger Try it! I think it works pretty nicely; you can just copy the blue channel &amp; paste into a new file, no futzing w/sliders.
@RobStenzinger (The Green linework shows up in the Blue channel in Photoshop; the Blue linework shows up in the Green channel.)
@RobStenzinger Green is relatively light, so I do roughs with it, then Blue over it for tighter pencils like you did there.
@RobStenzinger Did you know if you use Green and Blue Col-erase, you can scan it and separate the two colors in Photoshop?
@OZthecheesehead Just looked it up on Urban Dictionary. Oh, for god's sake.
@OZthecheesehead Snag? That's a new one on me.
@OZthecheesehead But I mean, I'm all for social justice. I'm a half-breed. I couldn't exist if it weren't for some degree of social justice.
@OZthecheesehead In my experience, the term is only ever used as a pejorative, like the person is overzealously sanctimonious.

&lt;/flips over table&gt;

That's it. I'm done.
@OZthecheesehead @MatubSDMF I will get a migraine if I explain either. Google it if you dare.
@MatubSDMF Okay, well, maybe that's fair. I am blissfully not a Tumblr user but was/am unaware of anyone ever actually calling themself one.
@MatubSDMF Make fun of the stupid shit someone says, by all means. But it's basically namecalling.
@MatubSDMF It's dismissive, which makes you look like a dismissive ass, like using "feminazi" or "republicunt" or whatever.
@MatubSDMF you should reconsider using the word SJWs, man. it… does not reflect well on people who use it. to be tactful.
@damnyouwillis Some people are such delicate motherfucking snowflakes. sorry: trigger warning for incest and winter?

@brandonjcarr Illustrator is tha fucken shit yo
@brandonjcarr @joeandmonkey And, definitely, I have no idea why Adobe didn't just replace the old "auto" kerning with optical.
@brandonjcarr @joeandmonkey Oh does it? Nice. I know before 5 it didn't have any real kerning controls at all.
@joeandmonkey Oh, then if you use 5, there are manual kerning controls. Not sure if it has auto kerning settings though. Probably not.
@joeandmonkey it would be in the Character palette. (optical kerning is usually good. you can also manually adjust it, but that's annoying.)
@joeandmonkey But try turning on optical kerning in Illustrator or InDesign (whatever program you letter in — please don't say Photoshop)
@joeandmonkey In the actual font, not without an expensive program. (I don't have any, either.)
@joeandmonkey the kerning is a bit goofy. did you use optical kerning? can you adjust the hinting?

@tropicalsteve I hope so! I've been looking forward to doing something — anything — else for some time now.
@tropicalsteve Yeah, though whether they sell well there is another story. Multiplex bombed in shops &amp; bookstores. Granted, it's Multiplex.
@tropicalsteve Many of them still are, of course, but digital comics are a way around that barrier.
@tropicalsteve Don't forget the impact of digital comics! Direct sales &amp; comics shops had become a barrier for entry into comics fandom.

@ryanestrada oh for the love of
why do I read the comments
@Mchuman Doesn't matter. If they're brush up, maybe you'll need to shake it to get the ink to flow again, but they won't leak or anything.
God forbit 173 people CHOOSE to give a game artist money to make shit for them. That's not a "real" job. Only corporations can pay people!
Practically every time a website posts something about a Patreon or Kickstarter, some idiot has to rant about "begging." Still. SERIOUSLY?!

@ThunderNixon Are you launching something?
@RDW0409 ...but with no obligation to be "realistic" like in the regular comic.
@RDW0409 what I mean by an alternate universe story is like the zombie movie (the hand drawn story): Jason, Kurt, Becky, etc. in vests...
@choochoobear i really dug that too
@RaeBeta ahh, thank you. I've definitely seen that.
@RDW0409 this is to hard to explain on twitter
@RDW0409 no, i know. I'm talking like Multiplex goes sci fi, but i still use that era's cast
@RaeBeta Could you expand on that one? I don't follow
@RDW0409 it probably would be. my hand drawn stuff is always that era.

@RDW0409 NOPE. My dad was a computer science professor. For the most part, he figures shit out himself.
@RDW0409 I did! I dig it, though I think I only saw about half of the episodes. Need to get around to finishing that.
@RDW0409 When I call to get internet hooked up, I'm like, "No, I don't want cable even if it costs the same" and they are confused &amp; scared
@RDW0409 I've read more Adventure Time comics than I've seen episodes, too, because they have like one season on Netflix.

@RDW0409 some of this stuff, too: 
@RDW0409 Those felt based on the CG art to me. But the 2D sequence in front of Kung Fu Panda… all the 2D art on Frozen and Pixar merch…
Those last two RTs were a lettering pro tip for you. I see that mistake in SO MANY web and indie comics.
@joedunn721 yyyeaaahhhhh.
@joedunn721 How does it feel to be starring in a CURRENT TV show based on a movie series, have them make a new movie &amp; not ask you to do it

@TheBlackNerd Star Citizen? Basically a sci-fi MMO where you can also fly spaceships around and pew pew
@TheBlackNerd It's maybe half a game. Maybe in a year or so it'll be good but it isn't yet. Star Citizen is 0.1% of a game right now.
@TheBlackNerd Do you play Elite: Dangerous?
@TheBlackNerd I have it installed but haven't bothered playing it because it's not really a game yet, y'know?
@mikedoeslife :D
@sohmer I'm so glad I'm not the only person who thought that. But I also stopped reading CA years ago because of all the self-righteous BS.
@justinpie @choochoobear That's kind of why I think CA's comment on it was kind of tone deaf.
@choochoobear This detail gets left this out of a lot of accounts: that "apology" was in response to her husband contacting Sims first.
Re: that last re-tweet, just had an idea for the greatest superhero comic book ever.
@ApproBAT what kept me watching was Jesse Pinkman. He's the one character I immediately found compelling.
@ApproBAT i think a lot of it was Tuco. He's just this total cliché psychopath. Gus was original and interesting! Saul was interesting!
Or maybe three. I forget, now. As soon as Saul and Gus showed up, anyway.
I love Better Call Saul so much more than I did Breaking Bad by this point in its run. (It wasn't until season 2 that I got fully on board.)
Some days I feel like I should have quit making comics after this one. 
@JournoBuedel HA! HE RESIGNED! Did they ask my question?!
@JournoBuedel ask him to resign

@brandonjcarr And the acting in my head was better. :)
@brandonjcarr I think that's what a lot of fans want. I don't get that. Why do you want to see something you've already read, but worse?
@brandonjcarr …the ones I've seen have been mostly so, so dull.
@brandonjcarr Totally. Some of them could have been good with twice the animation budget and 20 more minutes of running time, but…
@WebcomicsAreBad (Yes, I'm aware of that part of Peter David's run.)
@WebcomicsAreBad HULK NOT HAVE DADDY ISSUES
@brandonjcarr Coming off of Crouching Tiger and being both a huge Ang Lee fan and a Hulk fan, I had such high hopes.
@brandonjcarr That crazy scale of the biggest superhero stories is still way out of reach for live action.
@brandonjcarr I am continually disappointed that DC didn't try to do big-budget animated superhero movies for its characters.
@brandonjcarr BH6 is very good. Some really cool moments… some super cliché plot points… but, you know, it's still fun.
@brandonjcarr I have a fondness for the Hulk (I have anger issues), so I'm biased. Not enough that I liked the Ang Lee shitfest, though.
@brandonjcarr Agreed, though I think it got superheroey after the HYDRA reveal. (I also loved Incredible Hulk, though not many do.)
@brandonjcarr Still the best superhero movie ever. :) I loved Winter Soldier, too. That's probably as realistic as cape movies should get.
"Why is it so hard to make something that is completely impossible look 100% realistic in live action super hero movies?" — comic book fans
@brandonjcarr The best thing is, that totally sounds like something I would say.

@choochoobear are you dead yet

@MovieWeb @joedunn721 Funny how that article says it's not yet known if Olivia Wilde &amp;co. will be back but then that they will star in it.
@MichaelMoreci True. Also not on the web, though. Hit and run trolls don't spend money.
@MichaelMoreci Dude, all the hell I get for having characters who talk about movies — I can't imagine the shitstorm of trolls that would get
@roopjm er, assuming you mean a webcomic.
@roopjm Nice. Send me a link when you've got twenty or thirty in the can.
Wow, some annoying fuckface created a bot to tweet grammar policing to people.
@roopjm Those are a ways off, and I'll want to work on something else first, but thank you!
@WebcomicsAreBad me, too. there's a connotation of legitimately horrifying social ineptitude with "geek" for me. probably because I'm 40.
@WebcomicsAreBad or just never showed up, yeah. Like a dozen of them last time.
@infinite1der yeah, I was quoting that.
@joeandmonkey you have the Sunday Pages "catalogue" too, right?
@angelamelick sometimes when I feel like that, I find rereading my old comics helps remind me how far I've come.
@choochoobear never clicking that link
someone is wrong on the internet
@brandonjcarr Awesome. I want to try my hand at TV scripts, too, though I'd be more interested in an hourlong drama/adventure show.
@brandonjcarr Spec scripts? Can I see? :)
@WebcomicsAreBad (Which is, admittedly, about 18 years too old for that shit.)
@WebcomicsAreBad I used to get grossed out by it, too, but then I realized hey I'm a fucking idiot. and so I stopped. I was also, like, 18.
@andthankyou force touch and usb-c in an ipad will be awesome <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><GRINNING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><GRINNING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><GRINNING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH><GRINNING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@philiplord some of us watch @LastManFOX on Hulu. you're killing some of the surprise with some of these retweets, man! :(
@Dan_Levitan_ That sounds interesting…
@Andrew_Garda Maybe I'll give it a few more episodes then, to see if it hooks me.
@Andrew_Garda Can (or should) I skip a season or something? That sounds more my speed.
I just watched the pilot. I liked it, but not quite to the point that I want to watch 100 hours of TV to see the rest of the story.
Is there more to Supernatural than the whole monster of the week thing? Do the "where's dad" and "what killed mommy" plots get resolved?
@tonybreed so it's like fate that you platonically crush on him forever, huh?
Million dollar idea. Tinder for baby play dates.
@PaulFerence Actually, that would be pretty easy with Automator, but yeah… still not gonna. :)
Now my file naming structure is ruined. 
@tonybreed I'm pretty sure i talked about how terrible it was a lot.
@craig_montuori OH, YOU! &lt;winking nod to camera&gt;
I have an idea for a TV show—it's about a cranky asshole who's also a genius! So everyone secretly admires him and fap fap fap fap fap fap
@mindykaling Apropos of nothing, I love your cover photo (on the Twitter site). The Sense &amp; Sensibility movie is perfection.
@andthankyou is it? Huh. But yeah, that's kind of Wizard's M.O. Super shitty.
@andthankyou More of an "oh well, we already booked the space" con. I would bet on it never happening again.
@andthankyou @me3dia I heard it was a Bruce Campbell horror con but he had to pull out for the Evil Dead series. So they did this, instead.
@me3dia sounds right. If you don't want to murder everyone in the universe, it's not as busy as it should be.
@me3dia is that con busy? I almost went, but it's not a great time in the semester for me
@southworth @Tanukitsune they're probably just the toy maker thinking people might accidentally buy them instead of Minecraft toys
@thefakedana <WHITE SMILING FACE> i promise, it'll stay 25!
@thefakedana life begins at 25. You're still a zygote.
Most comic book conventions look like that too, let's not be unfair to the gamerbros.
From Twitter, it looks like PAX is where gamers go to get photos of themselves next to an attractive woman for the first time in their life.
@WebcomicsAreBad @mkinyon @joedunn721 ohhh, that joke went full Chappie
@joedunn721 @WebcomicsAreBad and I think it looks bad so i will just spend my money on something else. :)
@jellybeansoup aw, i just saw the Quinjet. It was retroactively not that impressive after all.
@jellybeansoup just got my nerd cred validated for another year from that, I think. have fun putting that beast together.
@jellybeansoup helicarrier?
@joedunn721 never go full Chappie
@__tmj -- but he's a 73 dude with bloody head wounds, you know?
@__tmj Yeah. The story changed a lot in the first few hours. There were gashes on his head, but he was completely lucid --
I just want to be Batman. The stories in those games have always been the least fun or interesting parts.
Aw, man. I thought for a while that Arkham Knight would finally give us an open world Gotham (with actual normal citizens) for a change.
Kitty 
@schafecast Sorry, not yet — wait, I mean —
.@notoserfdom He's alive, and in perfect hibernation.
@MatubSDMF Yeah, that exactly. (Or was or did or something.) — also, no, she didn't; I'm just saying that's what the crazies will assume
It just occurred to me that tomorrow's comic will probably make the crazy people jump to all sorts of insanely gross conclusions. ugh
@mouseydew It's a small-scale story, but I think that's part of why I love it.

@TheBlackNerd ohh. meh.
@TheBlackNerd Bird of paradise?
Sometimes I see the latest drama in comics and I want to shake the Internet and scream shut up shut up shut shut shut shut shut shut shut up
It looks like the "critical condition" may have been inaccurate — BBC News - Harrison Ford 'hurt in plane crash' 
@T_Stimac Duly noted.
@T_Stimac @BadAstronomer Sorry :) I meant that as a dryly sarcastic joke, mostly.
Harrison Ford reportedly in critical condition after plane crash | CBS Los Angeles 
@BadAstronomer @T_Stimac We elect the people we aspire to be.
@joeandmonkey hmm. Maybe so. Though i could probably stand to just scan my shit in for another year too.
@THEWesMolebash Gotta build up from somewhere. My friend's musician dad always said, "You don't start at 11."
@jilly_adams Out of context retweet readings in 3… 2… 1…
How in the hell have I never drawn Kurt as a Robert De Niro character?
@Rosscott Those things are an abomination. The coffee is whatever; if people like it, who cares. But they are so, so wasteful.
@damnyouwillis does this mean you don't really like me very much, but kinda a little
@alex_segura @pellertweeto I. Love. Archie. Samples: 
@drewBlom This is basically how I draw when I'm not making ANY effort to draw realistically. I should really indulge in it more. It's fun.
Drewng 
@rosalarian Is that really a witchsona, though? It just seems kind of like how you are in real life.
@ReflectorApp (And again, rotating the phone isn't an viable solution for what I need to do.)
@ReflectorApp If I force landscape, for instance, it could sometimes be upside down. I want to rotate the video so that I can project it.
@ReflectorApp No, what I'm asking (or requesting, I suppose) is for Reflector to let you rotate the video as it's displayed on the Mac.
@gmcalpin oh i meant just like pencil on paper on top of the tablet. I should try what i think you're thinking of too.
@bernardobri Hey, you! I told you on Patreon that you won that sketch but never heard back. E-mail me your shipping address!
It's kind of funny how much drawing I do on my graphics tablet is actually on pieces of paper on top of my graphics tablet.
I'm not sure. 
@jellybeansoup Found something that does the trick with a nice bonus: Hyperlapse has a very minimal interface.
@jellybeansoup Yes. I want to project up-close footage of what I'm drawing onto the projector in my classroom (using a mini-tripod).
@jellybeansoup Yes. That is how an intelligent, articulate person might describe it, apparently.
@jellybeansoup The point is, I want to stream what my iPhone is shooting, not the iPhone's SCREEN. I know how to stream the SCREEN.
@jellybeansoup Not necessarily, but I certainly wouldn't be upset if I could do that.
The Camera app has too much interface blocking what I'm trying to see on the screen. Obviously I tried that first.
Is there an iPhone app I can use to simply show me my camera's video footage WITH as close to zero interface blocking the image?
@ReflectorApp Is there a way to rotate the video with Reflector? Physically rotating the camera isn't ideal for what I'm trying to shoot.
@clayyount @joeandmonkey But really, even just a baked-in pressure API could be enough of an improvement. Apple wouldn't HAVE to make them.
@clayyount @joeandmonkey I think the rumors that it's an add-on makes sense. Most people won't need them at all, keeps starting price down.
@clayyount @joeandmonkey I wouldn't hold my breath for a Manga Studio iOS port. Manga Studio is just a localized Japanese app.
@clayyount @joeandmonkey The technology already exists. The only real issue is whether Apple can get the profit margin it wants.
@clayyount @joeandmonkey I think with the big enough screen, RAM and native pressure stylus support, the iOS apps will get there eventually.
@clayyount @joeandmonkey An iPad Pro plus 
@joeandmonkey Yeah. If an iPad Pro (whatever) isn't announced before summer, I may get one.
And the non-Touch 13HD's are $800 now.
@JaeClassic I'm only a couple of hundred pages in. It's interesting so far, though.
Every so often I learn of artists whose work is so good I think "Aww shit, I'm gonna steal so much from this person." 
@JaeClassic I had a Galaxy S2 before my iPhone 6! It served me well until iPhones got bigger screens, third-party keyboards &amp; TouchID
@JaeClassic Of course. I just meant to roll my eyes at the name: they didn't call it Samsung Wallet or something else, you know?
@pcweenies Yeah, I'm a big fan of non-fiction comics. I think in many ways they're better for biographies than film.
Leonard Nimoy (1931–2015) 
@pcweenies We call those just "bio." :) Anyway, Bluewater has a reputation for not paying its (largely non-professional) creators. Fuck ’em.
@pcweenies "auto"-bio?
"Samsung Pay." I mean, are they even trying to pretend they're not playing catch-up with Apple here?
@russpitts I pre-ordered that a month ago and totally forgot it was out this weekend. wooo
Sad day. 
@brandonjcarr Thank you. I was really happy how that one turned out, though it took forever. I need to slow down more often.
I drew a picture. One Patreon backer will win it on March 1st. Find out how: 
A New DC Comics Team-Up Series is Spinning Off Arrow and The Flash! - 
@Pandaboy355 holy shit, that strip has fantastic art.
@themikenorton I have no idea what anything is about
Hey Maya animator types? Where can I find good, fun character rigs to practice on (for non-commercial student work)?
I have never been more than mildly entertained by a Noah Baumbach film.
There are some enlightening parallels with comics to be drawn from the discussion of film and film criticism in that Kubrick piece.
@jessiesarah Forgive me if I end up using that conversation in a strip.
@jessiesarah Yeah! When does he turn into Roger from Mad Men?
@jessiesarah so he could be in his early 20s during the sixties, MAYBE.
@jessiesarah Me, too. But Samuel L is 66. They could pretend he's a little older than that, I guess.
@jessiesarah oh, wait, 1960's is probably way too early for the MCU Fury unless they pretend they've slowed his aging somehow.
@jessiesarah Hopefully they figure something out. I'd love to see Peggy in the 1950s or even '60s SHIELD adventures with a young Fury.
@WebcomicsAreBad A true fan.
Whenever someone starts a sentence with "I'm sorry but," a puppy dies.
@tonybreed He makes me sad. His track record was super liberal, but… yeah.
@joedunn721 @brandonjcarr @madmup the inside of your boxers are dark and gritty, joe.
@JGrayWebcomic It sure looks less ridiculous than sliding on an invisible platform à la Iceman.
@southworth @brandonjcarr True! If they built up to it, I wouldn't know.
@southworth @brandonjcarr I mean over the top more in terms of HOW they did it (acting/direction) than what they did.
@southworth @brandonjcarr I just read it as just shitty cliché. I think it needed to be a little MORE over the top to work as parody.
@brandonjcarr Yeah. I hope they lighten up a bit down the road. Superman not being "alone" anymore gives them a perfect avenue to do it.
@brandonjcarr I saw about half of it before I got bored. It's technically well made for a fan film, I guess.
@brandonjcarr The really weird thing with this one is that it's almost a parody already. They were THISCLOSE to being in the clear, but no.

Aw. Well, hopefully it'll still be good and whatever Lord &amp; Miller do next will be even better.
@brandonjcarr Exactly. Yet KS fan films get funded a lot. The fact that some companies don't care (i.e. Star Trek) doesn't make it legal.
@brandonjcarr It horrifies me how badly people understand intellectual property rights.
@brandonjcarr He's not even claiming it's parody, though! He just think non-commercial fan films are fair use. And… no.
@TheBlackNerd but it's fuuun
@TheBlackNerd "Dark rage"? don't be racist
@brandonjcarr Yeah… If it were parody, it would be fair use (like the director has tried to argue), but it's not.
@TheBlackNerd I'll miss you after the Internet murders you for this tweet
@Mchuman curses
@Mchuman Since, like, 1993. Yep.
@Mchuman Apple already announced the cheapest version will be $349. IDIOT. :) &lt;3
@JGrayWebcomic …but she (eventually) flies in the comics, using her force fields?
@pcweenies Janson is one of the greats, of course, and I have both, but if I were to recommend just one book, it'd be the Gary Martin book
@pcweenies 
@pcweenies I also dig the Art of Comic Book Inking book/s (used to be 2 volumes, but there's a combined edition now)
@pcweenies Framed Ink by Marcos Mateu isn't strictly about drawing for comics, but is amazing, particularly re: composition
@pcweenies How to Draw Noir Comics by @smartinbrough is excellent. I don't draw noir but it's a master lesson in the use of blacks/shadows
@emilyterrible Perhaps if all of your characters had this expression in every panel? 
@RDW0409 Dunno! I think "comic" (or comic book) works fine regardless of length. Longform comic if I need to be specific. If it ain't broke…
@RDW0409 Well, I do get particular when people call non-fiction comics "graphic novels" (i.e. Joe Sacco). Novels are fiction.
@RDW0409 Sure. I don't take offense to it; it's just not a term *I* use. But I'll call it whatever the creator calls it.
@RDW0409 (Neither here nor there, but I don't like the term graphic novel, myself. I think of Multiplex as a story-driven comic strip.)
@RDW0409 He was actually talking about the early, gag strippy stuff, though! That was in, like, year one of the strip.
@MacRumors Is that necessarily a "confirmation"'? Dalrymple just calls it a "response."
@jonrosenberg p.s. I'm going to kill myself for using the term "SJWs" now.
@jonrosenberg It's impressive how you've managed to piss off GamerGate AND SJWs in the same comic. Bringing the Internet TOGETHER in hate.
Why do so many LEGO sets have those smooth pieces that hide all the pegs? Be proud of being LEGO toys! Embrace that shiz!
@smartinbrough I was already a fan of yours since Shadow Cabinet but your Detective run made you my favorite Batman artist instantly.
@jonrosenberg I've had that done with my Patreon, too: pledge to get access but then depledge before they're ever charged.
@finalbroadcast Or about ANY subject, really! It was so dumb. But pop culture THAT dude was familiar with probably didn't count in his book.
@Revieloutionne Right?
@finalbroadcast He wasn't even talking about the story stuff, but jokes about a movie that somebody somewhere may not have seen.
Every now and then I remember someone telling me that all comic strips should be able to be understood without any other outside knowledge.
@comicsreporter Two: Denver Comic Con and the inaugural Artist and Comics Expo in Peoria (because it's my hometown).
@camilatorrano @FicticiaOrg That is beautiful in so many ways. (@WebcomicsAreBad)
@jonrosenberg 
It seems like some peoples' default reaction to comic strips they don't fully understand the context to is foaming-at-the-mouth rage.
@joedunn721 at least for jump street. after that, where could it possibly go without being a step backward?
@angelamelick I may have to check a recent one out just out of morbid curiosity now.
@angelamelick that... sounds strange.
@snas_dk the thought of @choochoobear following me into a dark alley terrifies me, and I love Randy.
@angelamelick What's it up to lately? I want convinced the writers knew where it was headed by the first three episodes.
@frostyplum i used to use Boomerang to schedule emails for, like, 9:20 or whatever.
@jessiesarah hating them is stupid. Simply not caring about them is the only sensible alternative to caring.
@choochoobear cue the <RED APPLE> haters...
@joeandmonkey @brandonjcarr @southworth oh shut up, you Cintiq Companion 2 whore
@joeandmonkey @brandonjcarr @southworth I did! I know! I own it! It fits in my coat pocket and cost $100 less! Exclamation points!
@joeandmonkey @brandonjcarr @southworth actually that's a lie, because i want to replace it with the iPad Pro if that comes out this summer.
@joeandmonkey @brandonjcarr @southworth size matters not.
@brandonjcarr @southworth 
@brandonjcarr @southworth i should clarify, the lag Ive had was mainly when I used it as a touch screen to draw, not solely as a monitor.
@brandonjcarr @southworth i use Duet also. it works pretty well, but there is noticeable lag with my first gen iPad mini.
@themikenorton why don't the old white dudes who vote on these things have the same taste in movies as me?!
@Taxicr I haven't watched the Oscars in years.
@joedunn721 I'm tempted to make a movie version of each season. There are whole plot lines I think they could cut completely. Mostly Don's.
@andthankyou it's mostly technical but it affects the experience of the narrative significantly
@andthankyou I think it does make it better, though. It has a different emotional impact than if you had to fake it somehow.
You know, Internet, sometimes you DON'T need add your cynical, sarcastic two cents to every single conversation.
@T_Campbell_ Multiplex currently has zero. The roundest number of all. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
@andthankyou ahem ahem bio
@esselgee The difference is that "Apple has said to be aiming for..." would not make any sense.
It's gotta piss off Canadian and British film production companies to get lumped in with "Hollywood"…
@southworth the new version is highly disappointing. the city size limit is so small.

Diversity isn’t important. Diversity is reality.” - @malindalo 
@themikenorton it takes a special kind of presumptuous asshole to connect your joke with that nonsense, man.
@MatubSDMF although it wasn't the line that was improvised but the ludicrously over the top delivery.
@MatubSDMF duhhh
@MatubSDMF i think so.
@MatubSDMF though *I* think it's funny, of course.
@MatubSDMF it's Jason's joke, remember. I have a hunch most people won't get it (or like it even if they do), but that's also the point.
@MatubSDMF no, though there was a little bit of an association with the creative process and vomiting out dumb ideas in the back of my head
@MatubSDMF nope! you'll have you wait and see.
@MatubSDMF thanks. I've been very happy with the strips this week, truthfully. But they're still totally dumb jokes. :)
I say this a lot but if you use Illustrator regularly, Phantasm is an essential plug-in. Check out the trial &amp; take advantage of that sale!
Create Halftone shading with Phantasm 
My comic strip is so dumb.
@choochoobear mine, too! though i was a like more freaked out about turning 40, myself, than him turning 80.
@choochoobear That never occurred to me before but I guess it's another reason I'm glad i stopped accepting friend requests from readers.
@annapulley by text, during sex
@themikenorton Sorry if you're long past trying to fix it and I'm not helping but it may be recoverable still: 
@themikenorton It wouldn't be that bad if there were just a little more dick bulge.
@jacksonferrell And the sound effects are just sloppy. Standard fonts, unimaginatively laid out with weird outlines…and… ugh
@jacksonferrell It's just aesthetics. It has to fit with the art. One I'm reading now is way too bold and has poor letterspacing.
@jacksonferrell I needed the characters to hit 140. :)
@jacksonferrell Crap lettering detracts from the art. It's all visual, you know? Hire a pro, don't just let the intern do it, for f—'s sake.
@jacksonferrell They're not "mistakes" so much as a complete lack of aesthetics. Shit fonts, poorly laid out (esp. for "sound effects")…
Brother from Another Mother 
@andthankyou what have they done i don't think i have anything by them.
(Dark Horse's stuff notwithstanding)
I think the biggest reason i don't read more manga is that their English editions are badly lettered and designed ever more poorly.
@caseyjohnston Uuuuuugh. Actually caring what other people have to say?
@jessiesarah yes! It makes me sad any time a character i love gets a toy with a bad sculpt or paint job. Because i want to buy them!
@poppity Thanks!
@tylerpage all three times, actually! :) but yeah, i always do shit like that too
@tylerpage I'm guessing spelling it "nuero-" instead of "neuro-" isn't part of some joke I'm not in on. Sorry, love you, still looks great.
@jonrosenberg @WebcomicsAreBad They're only saying that to sell more fortune cookies.
@SpinyN0rman Yeah, smartphones like to override the font sizes like that. I need to get an actually-responsive site eventually.
@tonybreed That lack of passion is largely appropriate to the stories he tells, don't you think?
I just chuckled at my own comic for like the twentieth time, in case anybody were wondering whether I was brain damaged or not.
@WebcomicsAreBad Positivity is nice. I like positivity (sometimes).
Of all the legitimate complaints to make about Comics These Days, lack of good art is not one of them.
@Kayezilla I'll look into those. I do love Thompson's art, but never picked up Habibi.
...But don't get all bent out of shape about it. Why give a shit what some random guy with a soapbox likes or doesn't? Like what you like.
The @guardian blog post on comics illustrates how being capable of sharing an opinion and having one worth sharing are not the same thing.
It seems strange to use a tag with 40% browser support to fall back a tag with 94% browser support.
Cranked out tomorrow's strip in two hours… after three hours of staring at blank panels (figuratively) beating my head against the keyboard.
@amyguth I've seen the first three episodes. Loathed the first two with every fiber of my being. Stupid, cynical drivel. The third was okay.
@ANMPH what do you mean? this is what I look like
@JaeClassic I ordered the first volume of that the other night!
@ANMPH I would love to see Mahnke + Alamy on a standalone GN. Something that could stand the test of time, you know?
@ANMPH A buddy of mine said it best: "A lantern corps for every color of the rainbow would've sounded like an awesome idea… when I was 12"
@ANMPH For sure. I just wish they weren't so far up their ass with that stupid rainbow lantern corp b.s.
@ANMPH Doug Mahnke and Christian Alamy are a BRILLIANT team. It pained me to drop GL because I hated Johns's writing so much.
@andthankyou Is the bottom right Kanto Wanderer? That's by far my favorite of his that I've seen. He gets… self-indulgently weird later on.
@ANMPH Yeah, me, too. Good art can make a bad (or mediocre) story fun. Obviously the ideal is both but that's… sadly kind of rare.
@rowdysplace720 I've read the first few issues but didn't get hooked. I'll try it again with a tpb, though, because I like Hickman's stuff.
Writer's block. 
I love Apple Pay
@ANMPH I found the single issues unsatisfying, but I plan to check it out in collected form eventually.
@berzo12 Oh that looks interesting. I'll check it out when its first tpb is released.
@joedunn721 The suckiest thing about comics is how long they take to make. "I loved _____ by ____. Now to wait 3 years for their next book."
@joedunn721 Sure. I'm just having trouble finding more great stuff, in part b/c I've probably read most of it. At least the American stuff.
@drewBlom It depresses me how much GREAT art goes into telling the same, tired stories over and over again.
@jellybeansoup I'm actually more excited about all the great TV (+ web) than film lately, truth be told, but I lump them together.
@jellybeansoup Sure, and I probably have at some point. But right now, I'm bored with comics, not film. :)
I mean, we're in a Golden Age for comics. Wonderful variety in art and genres… but so much of it is just derivative fluff.
What comics have you read lately that are truly great — not just enjoyable, ephemeral fluff, but actually GREAT? (From any decade.)
I'm bored with action comics, bored with the endless stream of pretty but shallow nonsense that too many people pass off as literature…
I don't want to sound too negative (me? negative?) about comics, but I've been struggling to stay interested in the medium lately.
@chrisarrant I'm kind of going through a similar phase, trying to find some work that gets me excited about comics again.
Oh hell yes. The full season odd Bosch is up on Amazon. One of the best pilots from last year's pilot season.
@drewBlom say hello to its other user for me
Do any of you develop your own Wordpress themes? If so, what (if any) blank templates/frameworks do you use?

@joeandmonkey nice! I want to see it when it arrives!
@joeandmonkey I don't know when exactly, but it was very very recently. They were only announced in January!
@joeandmonkey im scared
@joeandmonkey i.e.: 
@joeandmonkey No, the NEW Cintiq Companions. They're in stock, because they were just released (though not in a store anywhere).
@joeandmonkey Windows? Kidding, they look good. You might look at the newer Cintiq Companions, too, though. Probably has a better pen.
@CoolerMaster i'd happily take the fan to replace the one that came with my EVO that vibrates loudly every now and then
Apparently this is the shit you get when movie news sites depend on ad revenue. 
@dschmudde I've seen some bad ink!
@messmastermike People are commenting on the Facebook page these days, if you can stomach that site. 
@messmastermike Yeah, I took them out ages ago. Too many headaches.
@bernardobri you were the first, thank you
The Atom is a woman now in the comics? I didn't even know. Cool.
@joeandmonkey @tombrazelton hmmm, not so sure I want to see it anymore :D
@tombrazelton I think I tried to start from the beginning and didn't get hooked. Safe to try just a random S2/3 episode?
@tombrazelton I've seen like five episodes of it ever.
@JGrayWebcomic (Point being, that's where the whole dangerous stalker thing comes from.)
@JGrayWebcomic Before the "make sure I don't get sued" rewrite, it was written as Twilight fan fiction. You know that, right?
@rosalarian you wept uncontrollably as you wiped yourself off? or is that just me
@DisjointedImgs I'd be on Windoze though.
Did they ever fix all the major issues with Assassin's Creed: Unity? I've kinda wanted to play it…
@pierski @brandonjcarr There is no such thing as Highlander II. There can be only one.
@joeandmonkey I'm not a Pollock fan, either, but it's interesting technology, esp. if it can be used to identify other artists' work.
Computer algorithm can accurately identify Jackson Pollock paintings 
On the plus side, they're not misogynist shitbags. So that's something.
Cursory scan of their other posts show absolutely zero credits for any of the art they use with their posts. Okay.
They claim they couldn't find a credit… just like diplo did. Also ironic.
Comics website writes a post about the diplo/rebeccamock thing accompanied by an uncredited (albeit public domain) image. Ironic.
Armie Hammer and Henry Cavill actually come off like their characters have personalities in that trailer. Huh!
@southworth intill isn't a word so the request is null and void
@beardhero they're DANCING, obvz
@rosalarian It is one of the hardest things to teach, because nobody believes you.
@rosalarian Gonna slip that into the slides for my class today
@archcomix My middle button is also the scroll wheel. That doesn't get annoying at all ever. :1
@StoicStudio two hand axes &gt; one battle axe BUT one battle axe &gt; one hand axe (with or without shield) #BannerSaga
@MatubSDMF Not that I don't criticize other people in my comics (obviously I do), but I think best, most deserving target for scorn is me.
@MatubSDMF Fair point.
@MatubSDMF and Jason and Kurt and Lydia and the Blogger and
@MatubSDMF Hah. Well, I don't go on Tumblr. That place is horrifying.
@MatubSDMF Honestly, I've said nearly every word out of Barry's mouth from that :) Just minus being a dick about it, I hope. (Probably not.)
@MatubSDMF I like the word, myself. Subtlety is a lost art.
@archcomix I'm messing around with Maya for a class, too. What a clusterfuck of an interface.
Tim Cook is clearly destroying Apple. :1
@tonybreed I prefer "civil discussion of thoughts"! :)
@tonybreed I talked about that with Lucasfilm indirectly. It depends on how prominently it's featured. JUST in the background, no.
@tonybreed Only a judge gets to say definitively if something is fair use or not. So neither of us is right or wrong. :)
@tonybreed I mean, the posters in Multiplex "promote my brand," y'know? I don't mean to argue; I just think this is a slippery area with IP.
@tonybreed I dunno. "Promoting a brand" is exceedingly vague, and it looks like fair use to me. Assholes have a right to fair use, too.
@tonybreed That asshole did credit her, or edited it in after the fact maybe. I don't really use Instagram; I don't know if that possible.
@tonybreed I mean… 
@tonybreed The misogynistic insult notwithstanding, I'm not sure how using an animated gif on Instagram constitutes theft?
Wait wait, everyone's excited about this Spider-Man business? Well let me be the first to piss all over it.-- the other half of the internet
@southworth too late.
I loved Brats of the Lost Nebula as a kid, and it has never been available on DVD! Thanks, Hulu. 
@dodgr007 Midnight Cowboy was rated X
@southworth @WebcomicsAreBad @brandonjcarr memes should be wiped from the face of the web like the vermin they are
@joe_hill I like to read more than 1 non-fiction book at a time b/c if I got bored I could switch books but never more than 1 novel at once
@WebcomicsAreBad @southworth @brandonjcarr I hate these stupid meme things. 
@joedunn721 i already did! well, technically it was a mass demonic possession.
@joedunn721 multiplex is stupid
@joedunn721 don't watch the show so I'll just trust you on that
@CarlyRM i think Sony also loses the rights to Spider-Man if they stop making new movies (unless that clause had changed recently)
@joedunn721 holy shit that's kind of sad
@joedunn721 that was like a century ago!
@joeandmonkey bah. The Fantastic Four will be back in comics by the time the movie is out, I'm betting.
@joedunn721 they won't do another origin, I think that's a safe bet. Maybe do it in a montage or a flashback but not a whole film.
It's Official: Spider-Man Enters the Marvel Cinematic Universe! - 
@pcweenies think of it as paying for insurance, not a modem.
@pcweenies nah, those things aren't worth owning. and if you have your own, your ISP will blame it for any issues you have no matter what
@gmcalpin btw, your book and sketch are shipping out today!
@PaulFerence Yup, got it! Thank you!
Buy shit from the Multiplex Store today — randomly selected winners will get free cat hair with their order! 
@rosalarian 
@rosalarian I've been watching clips from it for the last two hours. I love them so much. I wanna get high with Jordan Peele so bad now
@rosalarian affluent young white people who are scared of dark-skinned cabbies but not random unlicensed, unbonded men with no credentials.
The thing I love most about Key &amp; Peele is how spot-on their genre parodies are 
@tonybreed It's okay, now you can rejoin the rest of the world in thinking it's a meaningless popularity contest.
@southworth dude?
@southworth I had no idea that had started! Shit, I gotta get my season pass.
@TheBlackNerd or, at the very least, it's gotta be third degree assault
@TheBlackNerd Yeah, that's not a prank. It's attempted murder.
@ZachWeiner I would e-mail my dad, because he has a PhD in Math
This isn't as unusual as that tweet makes it out to be, but… still.
I have no idea what any of you people are talking about tonight.
@andthankyou they are the worst
@JGrayWebcomic if you're lucky, eh -- wink wink nudge nudge
What's with you kids buttoning your shirts all the way to the top button? That is for if you're wearing a tie. You look stupid. #shakesfist
That's UK-only, by the way. Don't get too excited, nerds.
@southworth More than usual for Spongebob? I never got into that show because it was just too nutty for me. #OldMan
@keithbrochill just saw it. Certainly better than the other two. I noticed that episode wasn't written by Charlie Brooker, though.
(Mostly.)
John Wick was pretty great. I mean, the script was shit, but it mostly didn't get in the way of the brilliant, brutal gunplay.
@infinite1der it is the same format and genre. the similarities end there.
@frostyplum ahhh, i loved getting maps with video games back in the day
@keithbrochill i might watch one more but if I still feel like it's shouting condescending nonsense at me, probably not more than that
@keithbrochill that makes me feel better. Most of what I've seen has been glowing praise.
@TopOfMyHead @Logitech That's what I wanted it for, too! But nope. A receiver can work with multiple devices but not the other way around.
I've seen the first two episodes of Black Mirror now and find it shallow, stupid, cynical, vile and contemptuous of its audience. what the f
The fact that you can't pair a mouse with more than one Unifying receiver is utterly stupid, @Logitech -- why limit that?
@MatubSDMF I don't, but yeah, a little bit. pointier head, though.
"why are the movie titles in the background of the strip from 2010" — OBVIOUSLY I FORGOT YOU Foh yeah, I can just hide that shit
One thing I like about Facebook's comments is the "hide" button so you can just ignore annoying comments and no one is the wiser
@brandonjcarr sometimes I look forward to when Multiplex is over and I can enjoy drawing comics again
@damnyouwillis damn you willis
@damnyouwillis And watching the Space Seed episode (where Khan was introduced) is both very good and provides a bit more depth to the movie.
@damnyouwillis You should sit down someday and watch them. I'm not a big Trek fan by any means, but Khan is a GREAT movie.
@damnyouwillis ... you have, at the very least, seen "Space Seed" (from the original series) and Wrath of Khan, I hope?
@themikenorton yeah, I don't think anything she's ever been in has been good BECAUSE of her so much as in spite of her.
@TheBlackNerd I thought it looked ugly as sin
@TheBlackNerd I hated Majora's Mask so much. Ocarina of Time ftw biatch
@rosalarian upgrade complete
@MatubSDMF hahaha, you're barely out of puberty, little man
@MatubSDMF I thought you were like 25. I'm 40, man.
@jessiesarah Hey, what the heck is the difference between DisneyToon Studios and Walt Disney Television Animation?
@MatubSDMF THAT I knew, but I'm also like 15 years older than you probably.
@MatubSDMF what?! WIKIPEDIA WAS WRONG?! 
@MatubSDMF UUUUGH. don't you know anything? that was by Walt Disney Television Animation.
@pfangirl The deaths felt a bit… excessive for me, too. But good God, what a great game that was.
@MatubSDMF well, actually, Planes is by DisneyToon Studios, not Pixar. &lt;pushes up glasses&gt;
I don't for a second think anybody's ego was wounded by that, but I still feel a little bad. :)
Merchandising sales. Say, when's Cars 3 coming out? RT @DisneyPixar: What drives your creativity? #InsidePixar 
@TheBlackNerd I mean, if he's actually 40 pounds that's still a big fuckin' cat!
@TheBlackNerd Her hands are gargantuan, too. There must be something in the water there. Excessive Photoshopium, I think.
@tonybreed my Google Fu is unstoppable
@tonybreed 
@tombrazelton @brandonjcarr @joedunn721 i just literally started tapping my toe because of that. i am ashamed.
@brandonjcarr @joedunn721 Condor was the best. HOCUS POCUS, BITCHES
@joedunn721 Say whaaaat! I loved MASK! Except for that fucker T-Bob. I had no idea they'd been merged with GI Joe.
@TheOnlyTrout Yeah, I want a few Disney Infinity figures, because I dig the sculpts.
@TheOnlyTrout They're a very VERY short-term "investment," much like Beanie Babies back in the 90s.
@andthankyou I thought it was set after A New Hope? Apparently not. #causehesdead
@meowzz6287 that sounded way more gross than it did in my bread
@meowzz6287 in my mouth
@KahlGardner Facebook is the devil. :)
@KahlGardner ain't no thang. it was never awful or anything, just a few bad apples. I might bring them back eventually.
@KahlGardner ...anything a female character says or thinks or does no matter how innocuous, and so on.
@KahlGardner specifically of people incessantly leaving comments about typos, being shitbags to each other or me, being shitbags about...
@KahlGardner If you're on Facebook, people have been commenting on the Multiplex page there. But I removed them because I got tired of them.

@southworth i love you man
Anna and Elsa are Back in First Frozen Fever Stills! - 
@jonrog1 QUESTION. Do I get to be male, rich and white in the 1700s?
@joe_hill The Tomorrowland spot 
The Furious 7 Super Bowl spot was ridiculous — ly awesome. I'll pretend I'm next to you when I see it, @joedunn721 
I realize now that not watching the Super Bowl was a terrible mistake. 
@joedunn721 Christ. Even for a teaser trailer, that doesn't say anything.
@PaulFerence But it's basically a dead genre right now. Star Citizen can't come soon enough.
@PaulFerence Unfortunately, I'm a graphics snob, too, even though I know gameplay is king. Games older than, like, 5 years make me sad.
@PaulFerence Probably my all-time favorite game is Wing Commander, though. I just want to fly spaceships. Sadly, Elite: Dangerous is boring.
@PaulFerence hm--some recentish favorites are Civ V, X-Com: Enemy Within, Tomb Raider, Mass Effect 3, Deus Ex: HR, Splinter Cell: Blacklist?
@rosamundlannin there was a time I would have created a new Twitter account called Rose's Couch just to reply to that but I'm super lazy now
Oh I'm sorry, I'm supposed to only talk about movies: replace that with "watch The Iron Giant" #Superman
If the machine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind existed I'd use it just to play X-Com: Enemy Unknown for the first time again.
Jonesing for a new video game to play, I fired up Arkham Origins, which I'd never played b/c of bad reviews. The bad reviews were right.
@tonybreed you used to be a cat?!
@joedunn721 well, recognized the actor and he looked super grumpy like his character from Ikiru. :)
@joedunn721 I don't remember that part, I'm afraid, just recognized the actor. It's been a good decade since I've seen it. I should fix that
@joedunn721 Ikiru?
@ryanestrada It's free because they put an ad on the cover page. I like to think of that as a "fuck you" to people who make me fax shit.
@ryanestrada there is always 
@mouseydew She'd never ever do it &amp; I'd never really want a live action Multiplex but if I could have any actress play Norma, it'd be Tilda

John Wick Directors Targeted for Cowboy Ninja Viking - 
@MatubSDMF Yeah, I want more games with that kind of Arkham City/Shadows of Mordor style melee.
@MatubSDMF Did you ever play Sleeping Dogs? Loved that game. It was super stupid, but great fighting, fun driving.
@MatubSDMF As long as the cars in V don't slide around like the road is coated in Crisco, I'll probably dig it.
@MatubSDMF Honestly the main reason I want to play Watchdogs is that I miss Chicago. :)
@MatubSDMF I've been waiting for a sale, yeah. I don't play GTA, though — I really disliked what I played of 3 anyway. Might try V on a sale
@MatubSDMF Aha. Yeah, I did hear that. I don't know anything about what they promised and didn't deliver though.
@MatubSDMF I like stealth games. HMMM
@MatubSDMF One thing that really appeals to me is that The Division is supposedly going to be more of a role-playing game than a shooter
@MatubSDMF Never played Ghost Recon or Watchdogs. Are they worth getting? My brother liked Watchdogs but its reviews were mostly poor right?

@russpitts you mother fucker

GUYS. ALL BIG-BUDGET MOVIES ARE PANDERING. THAT'S WHAT POP MOVIES DO. IT'S THEIR…
@tonybreed no but now they're pandering to WOMEN/BLACK PEOPLE/GAY PEOPLE, not ME
@jessiesarah aha. I'll get around to it all sooner or later; it's fun. It's just not quite a "watch it immediately" show for me.
@jessiesarah orly? I've only seen the first couple of episodes. Did it shift into second gear?
@andthankyou i had a feeling!
@andthankyou ooh. hm. too bad. what I'm really looking for right now is exposure.
@tonybreed I'm pretty sure i didn't get it as a kid either, honestly.
@tonybreed the peeing metaphor is really gonna get lost in the reboot isn't it?
@andthankyou you hiring?
My #firstpayinggigincomics was Multiplex. Make your own opportunities. There are no gatekeepers in comics anymore.
@jacksonferrell you have ads. you've already paid yourself.
Somewhere, somebody is clutching their Samsung phone, crying and screaming "sheeple" over and over again 
@choochoobear @Iron_Spike I second the motion
@Mchuman It's the one thing that makes me sad about @simple -- the one, single solitary thing. Hey @simple are you listening. :)
that was terrible and I am sorry
A lot of people say the reboot is Ghostbusters In Name Only but it could be Very Awesome--worthy of being Ghostbusters In Name Also #VAGINA
@Mchuman My Amazon credit card supports Apple Pay, but I don't see myself using it much until my @simple card does, too.
@dcorsetto yeah, me either. the only thing I could think of that I've actually seen was "republicunts." but... yeah, no.
@dcorsetto do you have "repukelicons" and "libtards" on there?
yes but Apple didn't "invent" anything except for you know a system that isn't fucking terrible so people actually use it
Although in a perfect would they would just, y'know, not make any more b/c if it ain't Harrison Ford or River Phoenix it ain't Indy
I would be okay with this RT @Comixace: Report: Disney have their hearts set on Chris Pratt as the next Indiana Jones

@6sync well, your Client Login button sends me there :) i just want to be able toget from my acct details to my server management via a link
@6sync most definitely NOT biscuit.
@6sync the client "portal" rather, then? The one you get to from your homepage, which then lets you log into a "Client Area" which is
@6sync no, i meant i thought you used to be able to get to biscuit from the client area.

I gotta stop reading the comments.
.@hijinksensue That's part of why I got rid of my comments.
I love that Punk wants to sleep next to me while I work but the little brat needs to keep his goddamn paws off the keyboard OR ELSE.
@hijinksensue Truth.
@tonybreed As a super lazy person, I like to think that a sedentary lifestyle is much less harmful than it is made out to be. :)
@tonybreed I think so, too, to an extent but stomach fat =&gt; type 2 diabetes &amp; heart disease. Maybe a bit less ice cream and beer, you know?
@tonybreed And, like, is accepting 40+% stomach fat the right attitude when it is literally killing you?
@tonybreed I wonder about this a lot. Is acknowledging things we want to change (more muscle, less body fat, etc) the same as nonacceptance?
@GeneHa really! Cool. I keep wanting to take up archery but dont know anything about it, really.
@GeneHa Like I said, I took it with a grain of salt. But isn't it possible that there's a baby in that bathwater you're throwing out?
@GeneHa anyway, i'd love to see someone use a similar technique with a better bow and a bit less emphasis on the speed/trick shot gimmickry
@GeneHa and it seemed obvious that his bow didn't have a lot of power (barely penetrating foam) but he usually drew the bow back pretty far
@GeneHa i was skeptical of some of that, but the other video does at the least show that quivers were not necessarily universal

@choochoobear A few people have cancelled of course, but that could be for any number of reasons.
@choochoobear Although I mean to, I'm too busy with school to do anything for Patreon, and no one has ever complained.
@choochoobear Don't worry about it. They give because they want to support the strip, not for bullshit rewards.
Sandman was probably a little violent and dark for an 8th or 9th grader but the guys at my comics shop knew I was weird enough to handle it
These #fourcomics kind of sum up the evolution in my taste in comics in grade school. 
@justinpie terrible. it looks way too dimensional. should be way flatter.
i love spoon ♫ Inside Out – Spoon 
@ishneak I've never been excited by Doug Liman's action, though. (Bourne Identity is good, but Greengrass's sequels are WAY better.)
@ishneak Yeah, the story was mostly fine, and Emily Blunt was (as always) great, but the action never excited me at all.
It's weird seeing actors several years younger than me who look older than I do.
@tombrazelton @Rosscott @TheThirdRLM @joedunn721 well obviously, because of the webcam -- gotta do something for my patreon backers
@tombrazelton @Rosscott @TheThirdRLM @joedunn721 I don't. I listen to old episodes and touch myself nightly.
@ishneak I didn't enjoy that one very much! But Kurt would have loved it, I'm sure.

@MatubSDMF Grad school's good. I start again tomorrow — in the home stretch: one last class (animation!) this semester + work on my thesis
@MatubSDMF I love Vikings. It's a pretty fun TV show, like Game of Thrones Light. oh wait you mean football. no.

@jilly_adams well, on the up side, you get to read it for the first time, which i can't do. :) the Kindly Ones (near the end) is so perfect.
@jilly_adams i hope you're RE-reading that Sandman.
The key to great dramatic television acting seems to be looking as bored as possible at all times.
@rosalarian It shows that you know how to handle your dairy products. Obviously.
@MatubSDMF i don't know. It's gotta be on Netflix or hulu, though
@MatubSDMF That said, I'm a little doubtful whether Chris Carter can bring the magic back.
@MatubSDMF Some of the episodes were phenomenal. Anderson and Duchovny were perfect together.
@MatubSDMF It was very good. Part monster of the week, part ongoing conspiracy that never got resolved (plus two mediocre movies)

Gosh. It's almost like you can't quantify how good a movie is and different people have different opinions and shit.
Probably best not to reply "noooooo shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit" to anyone. And yet I feel so compelled to so often.
@hijinksensue Unless Jim Demonakos makes Reed's other conventions better, buuuut... yeah.
@hijinksensue Ohh no.
@catfish0182 nothing concrete, but with comics, I'll probably try something straight-to-eBook (i.e. Comixology) next.
@johnkiggins i haven't! It does look good though.
I'd probably get more done on this paper if I didn't climb in bed every time I needed to refer to one of my sources.

@andthankyou heh. annoying? but uhhh the new ones are better and cheaper, right? upgrade!
@joeandmonkey I'm tempted, but I don't know about an i3… I'd have to play with one in person.

@WebcomicsAreBad may I be of service, fuckface?
@ANMPH I think I like the fighting mechanics (which are basically Assassin's Creed: Arkham City) more than the story is part of it.
@ANMPH No, I rented it on iTunes. It's a $1 rental there (or was part of a $1 documentary rental promo when I rented it).
I'm playing Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor. I'm 11 hours in, and I haven't bothered with the main story yet. Is that good or bad?
(And definitely never, ever run a show of my own.)
(Also, now I want to be on the writing staff of a TV show.)
Showrunners is a really well made, entertaining documentary. If you're the sort who's into all behind-the-scenes type of stuff, watch it!
@themikenorton whoa! I didn't know Bill Sienkiewicz inked you! That looks great.
@catfish0182 Grammar corrections might get annoying b/c dialogue isn't always gonna be correct. Someone corrected Whitey's dialogue once—ha!

@tropicalsteve @dcorsetto @damnyouwillis Ah, who am I kidding. The relationship drama in Multiplex right now is between a guy and a movie.
@tropicalsteve @dcorsetto @damnyouwillis ahem ahem


@jonrosenberg they're making way less than they would with the wide release. The movie can't even be close to profitable for the studio yet.
@dcorsetto I'm excited to see what you come up with next!
@tombrazelton hahaha! I'm not quite THAT bad. Buuuut I do tend to listen to no more than, like, three albums at a time, on repeat.
@jessiesarah This was a good year for them, that's for sure. Easily two of their best movies!

@comicchameleon Clearing cookies did it.
@comicchameleon Oh, god. Duh. Yeah, of course that worked.
@jessiesarah Hahah. His movies are… not for me.
@jessiesarah But yeah, I'm not a musical fan, of course, but I think Broadway/theater can get away with WAY broader than film.

@TheBlackNerd I'm so sorry for your loss.
@TheBlackNerd You gonna have a foodbortion?
@sean80 MY point is you can't pretend seeing a movie with virgin eyes is important to you if you don't watch it reasonably soon.
@sean80 SIX MONTHS is not "right away"! I am METICULOUS about posting actual spoiler warnings for things that are ACTUALLY spoilers.
@sean80 Well, (1) How To Train Your Dragon 3 is in production, so… make of that what you will re: the "spoiler."
@sean80 That's as fair game as the first movie, by this point. And they're OBVIOUSLY watching the movie! Why would you keep reading?
@sean80 I feel bad if the vague shit in those strips actually spoiled anything, but six months. It's been out on video for a month.
@sean80 Then stop reading the strip where the characters are sitting down to watch the movie you haven't seen?
Punk is very insistent about helping me with tomorrow's strip. 
@andthankyou Sounds good to me! I will make fun of you behind your back with Rose if I hate it.
@andthankyou It looked interesting! (Partly just b/c I like Michael Shannon.) But I thought it was poorly reviewed, so I haven't yet.
It's really impressive how the movie musical genre has become a showcase for both the worst movies and the worst music.
@WebcomicsAreBad do it. people can fuck off on Twitter just as easily.
@emilyterrible Close enough! They call her Ronnie all the time.
@caballotecojo if you have to assume, is it really a spoiler? Without confirming or denying who it is, there are other possibilities.
@caballotecojo who do you think dies in the movie?
Roberto Orci Will No Longer Write Star Trek 3 - 
@Dan_Levitan_ About "him" dying? Honestly, it's still pretty vague! Who's "him"?
@onemileradius oh for fuck's sake
@damnyouwillis OHHHHH
@damnyouwillis I don't understand what you're talking about but you seem like you're on my side so okay!
So tired of crybabies who think the last two strips spoil anything about the movie they haven't given enough of a shit to watch yet.
@comicchameleon Hey, guys. I'm not able to log into the dashboard right now. Are you aware of any server-side reason that would be?
@jamiegambell I like that!
@jamiegambell I absolutely love the idea of a person being taken apart and put back together, reassembled… there's something great in there.
@jamiegambell Maybe, if the title explained what "remantling" means. I don't think I'd "get" it without more context.
@jamiegambell I don't think it makes quite enough sense on its own strong enough without the explanation. I like the general idea, though!
@boxbrown Been there: light roasts give me heartburn. Most dark roast coffees are low acid.
@zayasman Yeah, it came from, like, "I psyched you out" (or "psych-out"). But people who don't understand that popularized "sike."
@MunchSizedRants Strange, but less wrong! :)
I expect a bloody war between the "e" and "no e" contingents.
Okay, important question: how do you spell "sike"? Because "sike" just seems wrong in all of the ways.
@themikenorton is the new one good? It looked beautiful. All I've seen about it is just how it was plagued with bugs on release.
@themikenorton I've only played 2. Loved the fighting and interface, but got frustrated with the "puzzles" and never finished.
So is Shadows of a Mordor good even if you don't usually dig fantasy?
@themikenorton oh god. OH GOD
Such a heart warming Merry Christmas from a true fan.

@JCorduroy thank you!
@rosalarian you are my hero
$9.99 (Amazon) 
@brandonjcarr @theblacknerd thank you, I try.
@southworth good or bad? I've only heard vague things about that show.
@hijinksensue That was a thing of beauty.
@infinite_math but... all of his songs are about his cock.
Hey @SirenGene -- you have to cover this song because it is the best 
@southworth I'm so tired of masturbating to pictures of him, too.
@RDW0409 pointing down just would've looked goofier than 3
@RDW0409 youre misunderstanding the 7th panel. Neil just means for Kurt to lower his "demand" from 5 to 3 b/c its way higher than she'll go.
@tombrazelton neither did Chris Pratt four years ago
@southworth crazy! I just switched to an iPhone 6 (also on T-mob) and haven't had that.
@southworth That's Android for you, man. I had so much shit from Samsung and T-Mobile I couldn't tell whose bloatware was whose.
@CodeCloak I'd have thought the twist was cool in Doctor Who, I think. But I was expecting hard sci-fi.
@CodeCloak The "message"? Yes. Yes, it does.
I saw Interstellar last night. So it was basically Sunshine, except dumber — but also SUPER SERIOUS, so it seemed smarter?

Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Theatrical Teaser Trailer [HD]: 
Punk's favorite spot. 
The trailer for 2015's The Little Prince is so pretty I teared up a little: 
@southworth anything Phil Miller and Chris Lord do is a good idea. anything.
@andthankyou yeah, she's gonna get my iPhone 6 in a year or two that way, as well.
@andthankyou Yeah, that's what I have, too. Was thinking of bequeathing my mini to Karyn and upgrading to the Air 2.
@andthankyou It would be nice to have real pressure sensitivity and a more accurate pen, though.
@andthankyou Probably not. But even the existing stylii with larger screen would be better for roughs/sketches than a regular size iPad.
True. RT @jellybeansoup: @gmcalpin if you buy an air 2, apple will immediately launch an ipad pro.
I have a big ol' Apple Gift Card. I really want an iPad Pro, but that may never exist. Get an iPad Air 2 or wait for iPad Pro? DECISIONS
@joeandmonkey @takisoma Can I visit Zach on the Powers set?
@TheBlackNerd ohhhhh I hadn't heard that yet.
@TheBlackNerd It's a timed exclusive for we don't know how long. But not a permanent exclusive.
@jonrog1 "buy a guy a drink first" cracked me up.
@GuildedAge h8 u
@GuildedAge What about @philkaaaaaaaaaaaaahn? (would've been funnier if I didn't mispell it twice now)
I love working at home. Just me and the people doing landscaping work in December with their deafening wood chippers and snow blowers…
Hey, the Black Keys' new album grew on me.
@joedunn721 Does Sarah Palin count?
Gonna have update Multiplex only once this week (Friday) to meet a couple of my end-of-the-semester deadlines. I'll make up for it soon!
@jessiesarah Toph!
@jessiesarah I liked it, but sometimes people SUPER DUPER LOVE it get really pissy about the fact that I don't. Because... I'M a snob.
@meowzz6287 you're welcome
@joeandmonkey Duly noted.
@TZath (They're not trying to persuade. They're just stirring the pot of shit. And throwing more shit in.)
@TZath Agreed, but such sites have an unfortunate tendency to preach to the choir, for whom those things don't seem to matter as much.
Curmudging is now a real verb. I have made it so. Usage: Curmudgeons gotta curmudge. See: My timeline.
Some activist websites need to dial back the outrage. It's unethical to distort what ppl say to make your point. Let THEIR words damn them.
@tonybreed I'm not sure he has much proven pull, but they definitely know he can play an asshole genius pretty well. It was a safe choice.
@joeandmonkey Hey do you guys drink wine or anyhting (for tomorrow)?
@joedunn721 I love you, man.
@choochoobear If YOU do it, there is a market for it.
@MunchSizedRants (Like the zombie arc, but for different genres.)
@MunchSizedRants I doubt I'll leave the characters alone forever, though. I definitely want to do a few non-continuity stories.
@MunchSizedRants Hopefully by the time it gets there, you'll feel like it needed to end that way!
I get very upset when animated GIFs in memes obviously don't include all of the mouth shapes the text shows them saying.
@bernardobri thank you!
Cleanliness is next to godliness:

@jessiesarah More animation jobs there, too. :)
@ralphehanson I've actually never read (or seen) Polar Express! But I'm sure I stole the general idea from somewhere.
@ralphehanson Thanks! I was worried people didn't "get" it. One of the down sides to not having comments anymore.
@designcutsdeals Thank you!
@designcutsdeals Keep offering good deals on nice looking fonts, and I'll keep buying them! :)
@pcweenies Did you just throw a bunch of money at 
@joedunn721 Q.Q …the feathered iguana is neat
@joedunn721 Maybe 2 and 3 with the sound off.
@joedunn721 no <THUMBS DOWN SIGN> &gt;.&lt;
Cyber Monday is stupid, but the books are on sale, anyway! 
@jessiesarah I mean, aside from all the other obvious reasons why she's wrong.

@jessiesarah People totally complained about black Nick Fury! for fuck's sake
@nerdibird It has a multi-column layout, which makes lists much more convenient/useful, but that's the only thing I care about.
@rosalarian Can you tell what flag is over Spain?
@JHickman This made me curious… Have you watched Peaky Blinders?
@SarahJoSmiley oh man, he's totally gonna go backpacking down the rabbit hole
I fell into the GamerGate rabbit hole of stupidity again. Send me cute animal photos, please.
@andthankyou ok
@andthankyou NO
@nerdibird hmmm. that'd solve 2/3 of issue. I'd still need an OSX solution that wasn't significantly worse than Tweetdeck.
@deantrippe Vaders gonna vade.
@joedunn721 I'm not sure anything that can't talk in English can be as bad as Jar Jar.
@damnyouwillis How did you know that was inspired by #DeskToyNativity ? :)
I wish you could block hashtags.
@jellybeansoup A+ customer service would download again for free
@jellybeansoup dear gifwrapped where ur pornz at
@rosamundlannin so is mine
@angelamelick Scene where main character screams "fuck" 2,142 times. Done.
@DudeExclamation @GuildedAge I was thinking defecting.
Good night, Internet. I'll wish I could quit you again tomorrow.
Actually, it's not even all that dumb, but it takes itself awfully seriously for how corny its scripts are sometimes.
Vikings is on Hulu Plus now. It's one of those shows I watch religiously when it's on and completely forget about between seasons. Dumb fun.
@GuildedAge prediction: people will shut up about that "being pointless" after the movie comes out.
@russpitts hey, at least there's no "meesa people gonna what?" moment in this one
@rosamundlannin @tonybreed TEAAAMMMM OTTERRRRRRRRRR 
@joedunn721 it would be a lightstar. … wait
@andthankyou @rosamundlannin @tonybreed team otter, bro
@rosamundlannin @andthankyou don't break up you guys Q.Q @tonybreed
@tombrazelton I'm not sure it was always there with him...
@tombrazelton I had no idea who she was before that, but the whole field of "look how ignorant I'm pretending to be" humor eludes me.
People are asking if this photo is real. Like I said earlier... RT @trash_sleeper: amazing picture tbh 
@choochoobear i unfriended my mother because she wouldn't give it a rest about how much i swear. Is that better or worse?
Maybe "zero" is a little extreme...
I always forget that most people have zero sense of aesthetics. You'd think the Transformers movies' success would be enough to remind me.
@symatt I think someone took it, slapped real logos in front of it and  people have been posting it around like it's real b/c they are blind
How in the fuck does anybody think this is the real trailer for Episode VII? 
@MatubSDMF I quit if I'm doing too poorly. I did that a lot while I was getting a feel for the game. :)
@aaronshekey @Rosscott Nice touch with the "cammed bootleg" look, whoever did that.
It's probably kind of weird to say a game I've played for 30 hours is disappointing. But I played Civ V for over 650... it's all relative.
Civilization: Beyond Earth being $35 on Steam A MONTH AFTER RELEASE burns me up a bit b/c the game disappointed me. It's probably worth $35.
If the sales on Origin today are any indication, I'll be able to get Dragon Age: Inquisition for 50% off in a month.
@abbylark I played a bit of the second one but got bored.
@abbylark granted, I didn't get very far into it.
@abbylark what I didn't like with Skyrim was all the pointless, grindy "go here, kill that" quests.
@abbylark I love the idea of open world games, really, but few writers seem to have figured out how to do them very well.
@TheBlackNerd <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> what other games do you like?
@TheBlackNerd that was possibly potentially helpful, maybe
Inquisition, I mean. Obvz
Uh so is Dragon Age gonna be fun for me if I love all the Mass Effects but found Skyrim interminably boring?
@joedunn721 it was that gutter mouth Meryl Streep.
cat photo 
@__tmj interesting! (storytelling isn't the only kind of creativity, remember.)
@brandonjcarr and Die Hard is, "a bunch of dudes try to steal some money but run into the wrong cop."
@southworth Richard Attenborough is dead, you heartless bastard. #rip
@Kapit Of course they benefit from one, but they don't NEED a great plot. Characters and action will do just fine.
After genetically engineered dinosaurs run amok in a theme park, the fact that someone opens the park is what you find implausible? Really?
There are people complaining about the plot of Jurassic World as if it matters at all. A great action movie does not need a great plot.
@themikenorton ...why are you drawing Amy Acker?
Why does my naive ass expect professional writers to have basic reading comprehension skills? How do I still have any faith in humanity?
@AmazonKindle Would you please add a scroll reading mode to the iOS app? "Pages" on digital devices are silly.
@roddybarros ah, yeah. But no, the stupidity is mostly about the rioting, because the actual injustice doesn't even register to them
@tonybreed I feel so stupid for not knowing Pride was the anniversary of the Stonewall riots until now.
@roddybarros (is that even on your radar in Brazil? it's probably not news that the U.S. is racist, huh?)
@roddybarros people saying duuuuuuumb shit about Ferguson.
Unfollowing/unfriending so many people today on the social medias. So many people.
@TheBlackNerd VIOLENCE.
@radiomaru I always loved how the heart pommel on the sword hilt looks like balls there. It is the best.
@tikitikitin Thank you. :)

It's Official: Michelle MacLaren to Direct Wonder Woman! - 
@themikenorton The show gets better, I swear. It's actually fun once you get to the Winter Soldier tie-in episode.
Lovely illustration w/this article, too. RT @dschmudde: "Americans Say They Want Privacy, but Act as if They Don’t" - 
@tylerpage I think the big thing that bugged me was not being able to zoom into the page fluidly. Has that changed?
@tylerpage Most of the KF8's klunkiness is with the panel viewing mode, to be fair. And I generally never use that in any format.
@tylerpage Yeah, that's why Amazon could justify buying Comixology. :)
@jephjacques @choochoobear I get those all the time. I don't even run ads on my goddamn site!
@tylerpage good luck! I guess it's possible the book I read was poorly formatted, but it had none of the fluidity of, say, Comixology.
@tylerpage have you read a KF8 formatted comic? I think it's an awful format for reading comics.
@damnyouwillis taco bell
@pfangirl Totally. Zimmer scored most of Rango. When I heard "Finale" I thought he'd made something really I loved. Turned out to be Elfman!
@pfangirl :) I'm a huge Elfman fan. He gets pigeonholed with "spooky stuff" a lot, but when he gets to branch out, he is often amazing.
@pfangirl His score for The Kingdom is alright, but this track is great: 
@pfangirl His scores for Milk and Sommersby are very atypical for him, too (also great).
Peaky Blinders is so goddamned good.
@themikenorton go to beedddddd
@jeffzugale @MichaelMoreci That you might be interested in each other's work, if nothing else! But Jeff's sci-fi concept art is amazing.
@TheBlackNerd There are a few black actors in it. In supporting roles, of course. I'd bet money they're evil.
@jeffzugale No problem! Your stuff is great!
@jeffzugale p.s. Steve did 
@MichaelMoreci @tropicalsteve FYI 
@jeffzugale You ever find the time to do a sci-fi strip instead of or in addition to Not Invented Here, I'm sure both would be curious.
@jeffzugale I know some good writers! @MichaelMoreci and @tropicalsteve have both done a bit of sci-fi!
@jeffzugale I was gonna say I'm a little surprised you don't do a sci-fi comic.
.@twitter You would think that if you blocked an account, you also wouldn't see retweets of posts by that account. But no.
@rosalarian are they of you in lingerie? Because then it's not creepy, just suuuuuuuper weird.
@MichaelMoreci his name is Stellar, Dick. Haha

“Steeping” by Gordon McAlpin 
Still, I enjoyed seeing Ted Kord again, especially drawn by Frank Quitely, if only for a few pages. (Dan Garrett with a Bug, though? weird.)
It felt kind of how I would imagine reading those Watchmen prequel comics would have been like if I hadn't avoided those on principle.
I felt kind of uncomfortably dirty reading it, what with Alan Moore's… general dislike… of Grant Morrison.
Did anyone else think Multiversity: Pax Americana leaned a little too heavily on Watchmen?
@andthankyou *I* didn't do anything! It's Wacom's fault, man! :)
@andthankyou I had a driver issue. Downgrading to version 6.3.8-2 of the Wacom driver seems to have fixed it.

@dcorsetto People ask me why I dumped the comments from my website sometimes. … ………
@comicchameleon they'll retry them a few times, too. good luck! I lost a few hundred that way on my last project.
@GuildedAge I see that attitude a lot. "it's ok to be black or gay, etc., as long you don't point out my obvious hatred of you… or exist"

@MichaelMoreci Probably from me. :) If you're not watching The Flash, it's fun. Not brilliant, but good, corny upbeat fun.
@MichaelMoreci If it got better after episode 3 or 4, I've never heard anyone say so.

Chris Pratt to Play the Lead in Cowboy Ninja Viking - 
Hey, #ComfyCon panelists. I'm looking for an appropriate panel or two or three to sit in on.
@joedunn721 I think it could be, but that script was a piece of shit.
@jilly_adams She's a real DC character? I didn't know that (or remember her, at least), so I kind of groaned.
@rosalarian So we're friends, then.
@joedunn721 I'm gonna take a hunch saying Sony didn't want it without a big star, but they're having trouble getting one.
@jessiesarah Yeah, they could've saved some of the visual surprises, even no one was going to be surprised by the story.

@southworth no, she just used up one of her nine lives.
@dcorsetto @southworth My chest hurts. THANKS PAUL
@MichaelMoreci Dammit!
@jonrosenberg They found formaldehyde in the coma (last month). I'd be surprised if the comet's compounds are much more complex.
@jonrosenberg Sorry, didn't know that. Anyway, the point was: no.
@jonrosenberg They still need to analyze them further to know beyond that. "Organic compound" just means there's carbon in it.
@BilboStabbins Dammit. DAMMIT.
The Multiplex Store is now powered by Stripe!

@skottieyoung felt by far.
I didn't like the teaser, but that trailer sold the look for me.
@southworth I kind of wish the Tintin movie had done something along these lines now.
@southworth I like those images more than the teaser trailer. I am becoming cautiously optimistic.
@andthankyou You're not far off…
Fun fact: My dad did his doctoral thesis on "Infinite Dimensional Manifolds and Morse Theory" so I was destined to be stupid by comparison.
@jonrosenberg (or eleven, or whatever)
@jonrosenberg String theory suggests that the multiverse has at least ten dimensions, so it'd be the ten-dimensional equivalent of that.
@choochoobear But if you DID want to do posters, you should look at this printing company I used for… &lt;chokes to death&gt;

@Kisai Thanks for the help! It works for tags within the same parent, but outside of that, it doesn't quite work right. But it's a start.
@TheBlackNerd I dunno. Not everybody is a Christian, you know? I love seeing movies on Christmas.
@ishneak seriously, though, i just got tired of moderating it.
@ishneak i took it down several months ago and your just now noticed. Does that answer your question? :)
@dschmudde good point.
The preceding tweet may be slightly influenced by the fact that I discovered the manga and weed at roughly the same point in my life.
If you're a Miyazaki fan and a comics fan but haven't read the Nausicaa manga, you're missing out. It is a true masterpiece of the medium.
@southworth definitely -- but if the action was good, i couldve overlooked any of that! I'm very forgiving of dumb if there's good action...
@dschmudde if nothing else, any rich person who can't figure out how to become happy is either an idiot or has serious mental issues.
@southworth I agree. For me, the biggest problem was that the action was just dull and uninteresting.
@Kisai thanks! Will try it with real copy later today.
@Kisai rather, if any of the &lt;small&gt;s overlap
@Kisai Yeah, my instructor suggested that. Gotta figure out how to detect if two divs overlap and compensate.
@Kisai Whether it's absolute positioning and collision detection and blah blah, or relative positioning with a 0 size but… something.
@Kisai I know. But there's gotta be a way to do this with Javascript, one way or another.
@Kisai Yeah, that was another way I tried to do it. No way to have it fill that space in?
@Kisai but then they dont line up with the citation, which defeats the purpose of having them.
Coders: I need help figuring out how to make sidenotes using CSS only that will not overlap if they are too close… 
@takisoma so offensive, Taki
@nerdibird you vaguely resemble Jennifer Lawrence in that photo. Weird.

@beaubaldwin same! it was a pleasure
@beaubaldwin totally, I understood you. it *could* be easily abuse if the enforcement systems aren't designed with privacy in mind.
@beaubaldwin yeah that might work
@beaubaldwin it's so much bigger than that though. If neutrality dies, it's just a huge handout to big business.
@beaubaldwin a slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy, you realize? <WHITE SMILING FACE> I just don't see "free markets" as the solution here.
@beaubaldwin if they can only access non-anonymized data for an investigation, what's the problem?
@beaubaldwin you can easily measure your performance. The ISPs have records of your performance.
@beaubaldwin @daringfireball ...only after that citizen asks them to investigate.
@beaubaldwin comparing two customers' bills would be enough evidence of non-neutrality, for that matter.
@beaubaldwin @daringfireball the ISPs already have that data. I'm saying the govt would only get it if needed for an investigation.
@beaubaldwin @daringfireball besides, if neutrality is the law, companies wouldn't even need the ability to discriminate--
@beaubaldwin @daringfireball Govt could get access to ISP's logs without personally identifying info.
@beaubaldwin @daringfireball innumerable ways? how is this even remotely hard to imagine?
@beaubaldwin @daringfireball why would the government need to track it? consumers will report it themselves when they get screwed. I would.
@Morbuzaan thanks, will fix soon

@brandonjcarr @southworth There is no such thing as overthinking a movie. There is only underthinking them.
@southworth yeah. it was more than a little bit derivative from a lot of movies--and I didn't think it added enough to balance all that out.
@jemyoshioka It has worked out pretty well and pretty terribly for my productivity.
@jemyoshioka That's half the reason I got a separate Windows machine for gaming. The other half was there are way more games for Windows.
That last tweet was 140 characters on the button. Perfection. Thank you and good night!
Most of the time you see a butt shot in a movie, all I can think is "man, they are clenching their cheeks so tight." (Because of buttholes.)
Did I listen to the Cure because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to the Cure?
@tonybreed @brotherflounder So… basically heaven for you?
@tonybreed I noticed at Meta Con how a lot of dudes use cosplay as an excuse to go shirtless. At least this guy is in shape.
@tonybreed Oh, I think I see a tiny bit looping up just below his junk. Nice!
@tonybreed No tail, or can you just not see it?
Goals for today: 1) be less dumb. 2) be slightly smarter.
@deviousjen Oh, I was looking at 35–54. Because we're olllldddd.
@deviousjen p.s. we have an Instant Pot ("for her" — ha) and it is awesome.
@deviousjen There's a couple of non-grilling things "for him", too! Waffle makers! Nutribullets! Dutch ovens! :D
@deviousjen (People who cook, I mean. Clearly, I am not a woman.)
@deviousjen I love cooking. Some of us get excited to get cookware.
@BilboStabbins except myself and good taste :)
Gonna listen to the Cure. Because I'm 40.
@rosalarian lol ikr
@TianRee that didn't bother me half as much as the action not being exciting at all in the previous hour and a half.
@gaffe_tape Mostly the way it was shot and the nature of the aliens not being conducive to visually interesting fighting.
@gaffe_tape The story was good enough, and Emily Blunt was great as always; I just never felt the slightest bit excited during the action.
I just watched Edge of Tomorrow. I definitely just watched that movie. I've watched a lot of movies; that was definitely a watchable movie.
@Rosscott @guildedage Solid B from me, but I'm a tough grader. Definitely worth seeing.
@southworth Rent HTTYD now. NOW.
