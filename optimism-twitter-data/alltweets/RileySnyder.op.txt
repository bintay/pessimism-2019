@RalstonReports what time do your bills play again?
Munford’s made noise about switching parties. 
@AMdoughman thanks Andrew! That really does mean a lot coming from you.
@SandraChereb @RindelsAP thanks Sandy!
@tracicarl @RindelsAP thanks! Excited to begin!
Some exciting personal news: I'm joining the very talented @RindelsAP this #nvleg session as an AP relief reporter. Can't wait to start!
Things you learn on @WTFpod : Paul Thomas Anderson briefly lived in Reno in his early 20s
@blasky his NPR tiny desk concert is sublime 
Watching #nvleg lobbyist training, learned that camaign contributions from foreign nationals aren’t allowed. Happened once in last 12 years
@reneekad Michael Hastings was a journalist in the same vein, but I don't think journalism industry now would ever allow another HST
My Reno Magazine cover story on @HillaryForReno is out! Check the story at

Every holiday season, I'm drawn to Wham's "Last Christmas" like a moth to flame
@rossjmiller I'd recommend The Good Wife, which is half the seasons and twice as good
@rossjmiller that's 8 seasons of 24 episodes.... It's essentially committing to a part time job
My dogs are getting in the holiday spirit 
Per a Facebook friend, a NV state route is closed near Hawthorne due to "herds of cattle and wild burros fleeing dust storms” #sierrastorm

.@HillaryForReno just became first NV mayor to join @freedomtomarry’s “Mayors for Marriage” campaign. 
I had no idea that people take grilled cheese so seriously 
Key fact in @KyleRoerink1 story on  NV’s patient busing lawsuit- between 07-11, #nvleg cut $80 mil from mental health 
Fantastic article via @WorksThatWork on process behind creating South Sudan’s state symbols amid internal conflict 
I'm drinking cheap red wine, hanging out with cats and watching cooking shows. When did I become my mom?
@blasky congrats!
There’s a 'turf war’ of sorts happening between shelters &amp; nonprofits that deal with Reno homelessness

@BobzienNevada now that you’ve changed your twitter bio/username, it must be official. Congrats!

@James_Barragan @statesman nah man, you got a good head on your shoulders
@James_Barragan @statesman looks like Austin is going through a brain drain

Watching my brother's D2 basketball game. Love the fact that students are the announcers, can't really see Kentucky doing that
Lots of fascinating stuff in @byamberphillips’s obit of #nv03 race &amp; @erinbilbray campaign 
Last word from @RalstonReports : zero chance @tsegerblom bill to abolish term limits makes it through #nvleg "political suicide"
Ralston : @AdamLaxalt ,@VoteBarbara wins are hugely dependent on outside money. Says campaign finance reporting reform is needed
Even though margin tax was flawed, NV still needs another steady funding stream outside gaming/sales tax.
. @RalstonReports says only governor in his decades in state that took a serious look at education funding was Guinn in 2003 #nvgov
On #nv03, Ralston says @CresentHardy was a terrible candidate, says he thinks Horsford will run again in 2016
. @RalstonReports says Bill Raggio is the most talented politician he's covered in NV, says it's a tragedy he never got to national stage
Ralston : Sandoval will be mentioned as serious VP candidate, but could be difficult due to his pro choice &amp; other moderate views
Ralston: Heck and Sandoval top potential candidates against Reid, but even a 2nd or 3rd tier candidate could beat @SenatorReid
. @RalstonReports : Sandoval is the anti-Reid in terms of personality differences, general outlook. Still doesn't think Sandoval runs
. @RalstonReports : Convinced Reid is going to run because "he's not a normal person." Says he isn't wired for lobbying, retirement
@RalstonReports : Higher education has constantly been given "short shift" on #nvleg, especially compared to K-12
@fordm Google+
Reminder: @RalstonReports, will be doing a student Q&amp;A tonight at UNR. Also free coffee! 
I’d think @nvdems want legal pot to fail #nvleg and go to voters in 16. Nothing excites millennials like legal weed 
@AlexBybeeNV @VOX_UNR with all the new progressive, understanding people in leadership, it's a shoe in /sarcasm
@AlexBybeeNV @VOX_UNR at least you didn’t go to high school in Lyon County… 
Just saw @EddieLorton fist bump @renocitizen and my day is made
Vegas/NV is losing a great journalist in @blasky as he leaves the RJ today.

"If you want to know why politicians pay only lip service to the outrageous cost of college...here’s your answer” 
Marilyn Newton, a @rgj photog for last 50 years and overall fantastic person, retired last Friday. End of an era in NV journalism.
Hot Friday night drama right here 
.@TheFix ranks NV’s senate race between Reid and maybe Sandoval as 2nd most vulnerable seat for the 2016 election. 
It’s been more than 24 hours and no Reno police will say why they shot and killed a man a block from UNR. Pathetic. 
My most recent professional headshot is when I was rocking the moustache. I may need a new one.
. @Ben_Kieckhefer as chair of senate finance a huge win for N. Nevada. Half of #nvleg senate committees are chaired by non Vegas senators
@NVSecSenate awful news. Best of luck in the future David.
Will Democrats Rebel Against Reid? Many Hints, but No Action Plan 
.@runofplay uses some of the best descriptions I’ve ever read on this fantastic story about Japanese Sumo wrestling

Both Cafferata family members on ballot (Elisa for city council, Caren for DC judge) currently losing. So much for Vucanovich connection
@AnjeanetteDamon there’s a handful of assembly races like A-10 and A-30 that were competitive but yeah, picking at straws
Well now that @CresentHardy has been elected, the lede of the @SteveSebelius column is slightly off 
Amazing that @erinbilbray has same vote % in ‘competitive’ #nv03 as Annette Teijeiro in D-heavy #nv01. One of many ways to measure GOP wave
Jim Wheeler, he who said he’d vote for slavery, is handily willing re-election. #nvvotes 
Any other year, @rossjmiller runs away with a win and @LucyFlores puts up more of a fight. Just an ugly, ugly year for NV Dems
Closeness in NV AG race will probably bring up questions over logic of "none of the above" option. Currently less than 1 point difference
@rfrnk how about "this is what it sounds like when Dems cry"
numbers looking good for @HillaryForReno #Renomayor 
. @eddielorton is, somewhat surprisingly, at @HillaryForReno's election night watch party #nvvotes #Renomayor

Props to my Facebook friend who invited me to a bar opening in Antwerp next week.

@NYTFridge usually i’d be flattered but it’s a spam account 
@Emerson_Marcus @RGJRayHagar well technically it started as a bring crossing for Virginia City miners, right?
I got added to someone’s list of “My Fav Gays” so how’s everyone else’s day on twitter going
@brianduggan also props on adding made. took me wayyyyy to long to make the nevada connection
@brianduggan Are you taking suggestions? Trampled by Turtles has a song “Wait so Long” that references winnemucca

Considering most of the #RenoMayor issues are either budgetary or public employee-related, interested to see what students ask candidates
Schieve and Pez are in the double digits for debates. Both hugged before starting #Renomayor debate 
.@HillaryForReno &amp; @PezForMayor about to debate for what I think is the 9th or 10th time at @NevadaASUN. Follow along at #Renomayor

@tsegerblom @HillaryForReno @NVNewsmakers @PezForMayor Sam Shad, obviously
Also, wouldn’t it be something if Reid is behind all the Sandoval for VP talk? If he’s running that race, means he can’t run for senate
Brian Sandoval is the “Hispanic Mitt Romney”, according to Buzzfeed  


@sngyn92 drunk?

This is the time that all the LA Times people who followed me over the summer start regretting it.
I get that they have deadlines but the positions are legally the same, with just some ceremonial differences. Yet coverage is unequal
Shoutout to the broadcast stations at #RenoMayor debate that left before city council debates. #publicservice #watchdogjournalism
People on Twitter are complaining about #RenoMayor debate length but I doubt there’s an audience for an entire hour
#RenoMayor debate almost over. @PezForMayor closes with talk about being engineer, understanding Tesla.
@PezForMayor is talking about special responsibilities of #RenoMayor. But Supreme Court said city council member = mayor
.@PezForMayor on @WCSDTrustees - “positive things could have been handled a lot differently” Says elections coming up complicates recall
Dodge on recall question for @WCSDTrustees from @HillaryForReno #RenoMayor
Tough question on @WCSDSupt removal/open meeting law violation. @HillaryForReno calls the situation “alarming,” “incredibly difficult"
So far in #Renomayor debate, not a lot of argument - both pro-Tesla, pro transparency for state medical marijuana
Almost ready to start #renomayor 
There’s a UNRPD officer in the back of the debate room to escort off anyone too “unruly” #RenoMayor

And yes the city might be broke and the looming pension crisis is scary but hey, we got Tesla!
So in next 3-5 years, Reno will have #Tesla, Uber, an Apple data center and potentially high speed fiber Internet. #renorevival is right.
Of course that's chump change to the more than $1 billion in tax breaks proposed for the gigafactory
Appears #Tesla will donate $37.5 million to K-12 education in 2018, per @RalstonReports. #nved
Haven’t see this before, but @Uber is hiring drivers in the Reno/Sparks area 
So #Tesla’s gigafactory will be located in an industrial park run by the Mustang Ranch brothel owner
