@KidKraft My daughter says mommy daddy and her dogs .. her placemat at school! #KidKraftThanks 
@Sears she said it was the only way to get the issue fixed and Id have to wait up to 12 days. I called from Sears in Beaumont
@Sears 2 orders, 2 diff stores. I have to wait up to 12 days to reorder due to using points.   20 and 35 miles away not that easy.
@Sears anyway I can email since I cannot get the rep to understand me or what went wrong. *sigh*
@Sears extreamly disappointed with customer service on the phone tonight. Kudos to the Beaumont TX store, but no issue resolved..
@ShopYourWay great thank you. Hope its there for cyber monday! (:
@PTPA a mani and a pedi! Too much to ask for?? Lol
@ShopYourWay how long should it take for my points to be available
@Kohls good luck all!fingers crossed for a DM
@Sears cant go wrong on long trips! Have you ever listened to wheels on the bus for 4 hours? LOL
@Sears bought the black pair for $20 got that back in points and used them to buy my daughters, got $10 in pts back
