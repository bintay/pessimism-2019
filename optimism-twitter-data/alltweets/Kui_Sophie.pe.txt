"You don't see the Chris i see when we're alone"-Karrueche 
Lol cuuuz baby these fuckboys smooth as hell
So Christina Milan is Karrueches bestfriend...... Who watched this monkey disrespect her like that. 
I survived their master lol"@RobinsonGitonga: @Kui_Sophie haha smart , you'll find the deal breaker , I'll be ready for stories on the TL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>"
Ah it's 4* years...
Looooooool @ettenany  let's be besties !
@RobinsonGitonga uhm not really.just almost enough times.I run before i can consider staying... But ik if i didn't i can see myself in such.
What!!! <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL><HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>"@ettenany: @REYKAI_ @tateanda this guy speaks such relatable truths yes??"
Pressure ya nini? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RobinsonGitonga haha i can't even judge any girl though. I know the spell some guys have on us
need to sit their asses down a…
@ettenany   you know ! Smh advicing on relationships like some real experts at life.
@RobinsonGitonga lol it takes a while to know better than to fall back. She met him at 21 I'm guessing by then she didn't know better
Anyway this is just karrueches case that I'm identifying with...
I don't think there's anyone as content in being alone as i am... But i need my Wendys ofcourse.
And I'm more less likely to stand Bullshit... Which is a pro despite some thinking being alone means you're lonely
Also I'm not saying all boys are fuckboys NO. There are good guys too. I just happen to have met my fair share of fuckboys.
"@RobinsonGitonga: @Kui_Sophie what does that say about her tho.." But wallai you can't judge unless you're a girl.niggas are smooth!!!
I don't advocate that you leave over everything. No. But have your limits. Maryjane has hers <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> though fucked up
And Lol don't start that "she's never been in a relationship" fufu lame shit lol <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>. This may or may not be out of experience
And they are smooooth! If i didn't know any better I'd be trippin head of a heels ready to forgive if i saw this 
Something about fuckboys... They'll always try get you back. You need to think from a third person point of view... 
And karrueche dated him 5 fucking years... With all that disrespect from him and she stayed.
Chris Brown the leader of fuckboys though lol. Both Rih and Karrueche do an interview after their break up to tell us of him
