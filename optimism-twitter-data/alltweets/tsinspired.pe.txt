Really caring for someone= putting their needs/wants first. Not just say it- actually do it! Big difference! Some people can't/won't do it
Can't shake this feeling this morning... Normally I can act normal but today it's too much effort
Really not used to having an empty house on a Saturday......

“Sometimes things become possible if we want them bad enough.” 
Um

“But wishes are only granted in fairy tales.”

@princess7bunny @PerthScriptette the parade was fantastic! Apart from some peanut wanting my flag as I walked through the crowd....
@princess7bunny @PerthScriptette he was amazing, though I only heard two songs- as I had to go down to the dressing room.
@princess7bunny @PerthScriptette wish I could have gotten a photo with them <SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE> even the group photo I ended up way at the back
@princess7bunny @PerthScriptette some of my fellow flaggies probably thought I was nuts... But meh. I was so so hyper all night!!!!

Wow! Girls go back to school Monday! May actually manage to have a tidy house for a short time <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@princess7bunny it took me almost 3 yrs. Felt good. just wish it meant that it stopped the drama from the ex n got him out of my life
@princess7bunny whoop! Its such an awesome feeling when its finalised!
Why is it, that the 1 thing my 9 yr old wants, is the 1 thing that I could never give her? Why oh why does she ask the impossible??? <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>

@RAlejandro3 safe travels
The million $$ question. What to have for dinner... Soup or salad....
@princess7bunny oh dear. At one stage I couldn't work out how to turn off driving mode- no matter what, I did it spoke the name of caller <SMIRKING FACE>
@princess7bunny I hate when that happens. I no sooner learn where everything is and it changes again <SMIRKING FACE>
Just a tad bit bored.....
@samanthas555  thats no good <HUSHED FACE>
@samanthas555 hope you feel better soon. Get some rest and drink plenty of water
Good morning/afternoon/evening. Hope you have a good day/afternoon/evening.
Its nearly the weekend! Just over a week til i see @thescript

@BlackHiTop it was.. Amazing? Fantastic? Awesome? Hope you have a fantastic time <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
*sigh* wish I had someone to bring me breakfast in bed.... But no, I've gotta get out of my warm, comfy bed to get my own <SMIRKING FACE>
Wahhhhhh it's morning already!!!!!!! Whose stupid idea to be awake at stupid o'clock? Oh yeah, that's right. Mine. Have a good day/night!

Seriously lacking the motivation to go to tonight's fun fit sesh. Think I need someone to motivate me....
Tis way to quiet everywhere. Hope everyone has a great day/night.
@samanthas555 thanks :) I'm good. Hope you have a good day
@samanthas555 morning :)
The joys of waiting in a phone call, that I can not miss. They were meant to ring at 9:30, 17 mins and counting... I hope they hurry up
@thescript @BlackHiTop @TheScript_Danny  hope you have a fantastic day and an amazing night!!!! Hope the jet lag isn't too bad<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
Going to get me some sleep. Night all
@princess7bunny @thescript hehe wish I could say I'm listening to music right now, but I have something else I have to do <SMIRKING FACE>
Oh joy. Time to do some work, and listen to an online training....I can think of other things I would rather be doing...

#TGIM Rain Hail or Sunshine tomorrow's #Funfit #Butler will be on!!!! Drop me a message on 0449 762… 
Bugger bugger bugger! Was caller 7 n needed to be caller 10 to win tickets to a meet n greet with @thescript when they are in Perth!!!Bugger
@samanthas555 @GlenPowerfanpag @BlackHiTop I know that feeling. Think there is a rule that we mums don't get rest when unwell <SMIRKING FACE>
@GlenPowerfanpag @samanthas555 @BlackHiTop rest, n plenty of water. Hope you feel better soon. Not easy being sick and being a mum
@samanthas555  @BlackHiTop that's not fair. Anyone can get one here for $25, but if you have certain conditions you get it free.
@BlackHiTop good to hear
@BlackHiTop Good morning :) Hope you had a good night :)
Loving hearing #ManOnAWire on radio @thescript though I wish the radio station would learn the name - they are calling it Man On Wire lol

Not even winter and we've had nothing but wet days. Not fun for the munchkins spending their holidays stuck indoors.....
@BlackHiTop <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> thanks for brightening up my morning!!!!
There is something I want 2 say, but not sure how 2 go about it, so instead I'll sit here and go over n over in my head, making my head hurt

@GirlOnAWireNSWS a herbal aloe gel- it's awesome for everything- sunburn etc
@GirlOnAWireNSWS that's what I used 1st time. This time I used something different :)
@GirlOnAWireNSWS it's soo much fun. My 1st itched like crazy, the last 3 not really and were completely healed within 2 weeks
@GirlOnAWireNSWS hehehe I got my first um, 10 yrs ago I think. Then it took me forever to decide. Now to sort out money and what I want now
