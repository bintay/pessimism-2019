@DoodleChronicle I'm so glad you have a fab GP now. X
Tory ministers want to bring back capital punishment<CONFUSED FACE> The idea makes me feel sick. It's chilling how far to the right we seem to be heading.

The news about Tory planned cuts are creating the sort of fear and dread not seen in society since in Voldemort infiltrated the ministry.
Depressing that Cameron's cabinet has someone who voted against equal marriage in charge of equality. #godhelpus
Doesn't feel like there is anything to be hopeful or optimistic about at the moment.
@EmmaKennedy Thank you for sticking up for all the vulnerable people worried about the future. Wish you were PM.
The Independent told people to vote Tory and then complain that Tories cut disabled person work scheme. Hypocritical much?

@Alpha_Annelisa I am partial to a sun ray picture too but think the second pic is my favourite because the trees stand out with sun behind.
@Alpha_Annelisa I like the framing of the second and the trees stand out more too.
I'm seeing so many people on here worrying about the future now. Many of them have a disability/mental illness/are single parents etc.
The majority of my timeline seem shocked/gutted/angry about the election result. Me too, I can't believe so many people voted Tory. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Doubt Cameron would be in favour of proportional representation though <SMIRKING FACE>
We need electoral reform to make it fairer. All areas of UK should be represented equally. Proportional representation please!
@queenmaz6 It's alright, I understand, forget it. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@queenmaz6 Yes of course, I'm just feeling a bit sensitive at the moment and probably overreacted.
@queenmaz6 Ok
@queenmaz6 You misunderstood that my criticism is aimed entirely at D Cameron. It's not rubbish, it is my opinion which I am entitled to.
@queenmaz6 I'm not blaming Scotland! You've completely misunderstood the point I was making.
It's not quite the Pro-Tory message that Cameron would have you believe.
The reason the Tories did so much better than Labour is because Scotland voted almost unanimously for an ANTI-TORY party.
Cameron claiming that this election proves people want them to finish what they started is kind of misleading.
@ben_cameron Interesting analogy. Is the camera the Tories? Achieving their goal(votes) through fear while the vulnerable suffer.
I don't know whether to scream or cry. The vulnerable in our society are the ones who lost today. The injustice of it makes me sick.
Genuinely worried about the next 5 years and beyond. I fear for the vulnerable in our society and will we even recognise the NHS in 2020?
DC also said 'those who can't, we always help'. So how come the poor are poorer than ever under his govt whereas the rich are getting richer
Did David Cameron really just say they fought a 'positive' campaign?! Er.. No! It was a very negative campaign based on fear.
There's still hope, right?
Labour + SNP ?
#election2015
I'm lost for words right now.
@depressednotsad Ditto!
@greg_jenner I'm staying up too and I'm relieved to know I'm not the only one who's excited.
@gandy Thanks
@gandy I love this idea. Where did you get the map from?
@greg_jenner Brilliant! Also loved Newzoids' election song #putthevotersoff
A 2 wk wait while they form gov't would be harder to bear than the seemingly endless pause before announcing winner of Strictly or X Factor.
Cameron would also have up to 2 weeks to form a gov't which means we could have a long wait to find out who is the next PM. <WEARY FACE>
I think the party with the most seats should get 1st chance to form a gov't but it's the previous PM, i.e. David Cameron who gets first go.
Can anyone clarify: In the event of a hung parliament, is it the party with the most seats that gets the first chance to form a government?
@mentalbattle Wow, happy for you. They are lucky to have you, I'm sure you'll be fab x
@mentalbattle That sounds exciting! On TV or radio? Or via twitter?
Who is planning an all-nighter to watch the results come in?
@mentalbattle Good for you! X
If you are still undecided, try @voteforpolicies to see whose policies you really support without the distraction of lies and propaganda.
@TraceyJPallett Great! I expect it's busiest after 5pm when people finish work. I'm voting at 3pm because my daughter wants to come too.
Today's the day. Let's kick em out!
@TraceyJPallett There's not once been a queue when I've voted! You could do with one of those small folding chairs that you can carry.
@TraceyJPallett Can you not get a lift?
@DoodleChronicle I wish I could magic it all better for you. You can DM me if you need to talk or if I can do anything. X
I can't bear the thought of there being a Tory gov on May 8th. I might actually cry. Seriously <CONFUSED FACE>
The Torles still embody that cynicism, appealing to greed &amp; fear in us. Do…

ED Miliband led a rent strike


Yet another UKIP candidate suspended (good riddance). Do they even have anyone other than Nige left to run in the election? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@greg_jenner I think Ed was foolish to rule out a Labour+SNP deal. It could come back to haunt him a la Clegg re tuition fees.
@DoodleChronicle Big hugs xx
@DoodleChronicle When you get your records, please don't read them alone. Have someone you trust with you in case it's upsetting.
@DoodleChronicle There is some evidence that intelligent people are more susceptible to mental illness. Can't remember where I read it tho.
@DoodleChronicle ... that some mental health workers also share this perspective.
@DoodleChronicle I hate it when I encounter this perspective on mental illness. It's all the more upsetting and concerning to hear ...
@DoodleChronicle You need to put it in writing and there may be a fee to see them. X
@DoodleChronicle Have a look here honey 
@DoodleChronicle Did they actually say that? You have an illness; it is not your fault. Xx
Happy Star Wars Day everyone! #MayThe4th
@DoodleChronicle Good <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ I've not felt like chatting on here as much as normal recently but I've still been thinking of you. X

#GetCameronOut 
@matthaig1 Is that Boris on the front row?
Right, it's tea and toast for brekkie, bit of Sunday Brunch on TV, and then I must go out to do food shop or we'll starve. Goodbye for now.
Ed's going to have to reconsider if he gets the chance to form a government next wk. As much as I hate it, a deal seems the only way to go.
You could say its admirable, but Labour's refusal to consider deals just let's Cameron into power. I'm sure he won't have any such scruples.
Labour are wrong to rule out any deals with other parties. Surely that is the only way they could get a majority.
@Jinthelife It's not at all productive yet. Need to get out of bed first.

I really hope that May 7th sees a record turnout at the polling stations, like we saw for the referendum in Scotland.
@mrdouglaswood Great! I always find it motivating when there is a visible light at the end of the tunnel.
@mrdouglaswood I'm alright thanks. Sorry you've been in need of hugs, I hope things improve. You can tweet/DM me if you ever need to talk.

@DoodleChronicle Is it possible to ask someone you trust to make the call on your behalf? Xx
@DoodleChronicle Please try again after 4. Can I do anything to help? Need to talk?
@greg_jenner I hope your day gets better.
@DoodleChronicle Yay! So happy for you. I hope this is a turning point.
@DoodleChronicle The GP was understanding - if you don't get heard by HTT go see GP again and tell her. I think she'd fight for you.
@DoodleChronicle ..hospital admission. I know you don't want that but at least you'd get care sooner. <CONFUSED FACE>
@DoodleChronicle I don't know why she said it would be a year when clearly you need it earlier. The point of crisis teams are to prevent ...
@toastersrock She's with her Dad but I've been chilling out, child-free <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@DoodleChronicle I wish I could do something to get you the care you deserve. I hope HTT are nice and take time to listen. Xx
@DoodleChronicle Just caught up on how things went at your appointment. I'm really angry for you now. That's terrible care. Xx

@Kitten_Fish You could try @StandardIssueUK. It's an online magazine by some lovely and funny women including @SarahMillican75.
@DoodleChronicle Not bad thanks. Have done some housework and been out for a walk. X
@DoodleChronicle Great, thanks. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@DoodleChronicle I've heard of it. It's on my growing list of books to read.
If you like musicals and you've never seen Hairspray, it's on E4 now or E4+1 in 15 mins. Uplifting w/ great soundtrack. Highly recommend.
David Cameron is delusional if he doesn't realise his party policies favour the rich and hurt the poor.
@DoodleChronicle Okay, I'll be around later if you need anything. X
@DoodleChronicle Anything I can do? Do you need to talk even if it's just for distraction? X
@VirtualAstro Gutted I missed the dragon. Sounds like it was amazing. How long until we get the chance again?
@TraceyJPallett I've never tried taking a picture though. Don't have a garden. It would look odd setting a tripod up in the carpark outside.
@TraceyJPallett I nearly always try but it's usually too cloudy. I've seen most of them this month though thanks to the good weather.
@TraceyJPallett No not a thing <WEARY FACE> I must've been too late.
@TraceyJPallett Did you spot dragon? <ROCKET><DRAGON>
@VirtualAstro I must be the only one that didn't see it despite clear skies <WORRIED FACE> I'd like to see photos if anyone got some?
A ginormous spider just ran across my living room! Nearly jumped out my skin because I've not seen any in ages. I wonder when he moved in?
@DoodleChronicle You're welcome xx
@DoodleChronicle You're still here, still fighting and managing to cook, study and go to scary appointments. Small victories matter. X
@DoodleChronicle I might go for a walk soon. I'm child-free this evening so not restricted time wise.
@DoodleChronicle I've been quite lethargic last couple of days. I need to increase my motivation and energy levels somehow.
Making an uplifting playlist and I'd forgotten how much I love Lose Control by The Saturdays. Vanessa's voice is incredible. Full on diva. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I can't believe anyone would consider voting Tory in this election. It makes me feel sad <PENSIVE FACE>
@TraceyJPallett Yes we've been to the park, played games etc. It was lovely.
@TraceyJPallett She's been at home for Easter so I guess I'd got used to her being at home.
@TraceyJPallett Yes but I am used to being alone and it doesn't normally bother me. When it's just a couple of days, I like the space.
@TraceyJPallett I'm ok thanks although kind of a 'down' day. Not sure why. My daughter's at her aunt's for a few days so it might be that.

@bexxc I understand this anxiety completely. I eased my fear by saving in 2 or even 3 different locations and also print regularly.
@wonkyalison They should just link to the result and not put it in headlines. Hey @BBCSport and @bbcnews, we want spoiler-free headlines!!
Got to say for anyone not at the game or near a sky TV set, the bbc live sport feed by @TJRostance is always a good read. Funny too. <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>

@wonkyalison I know now it was foolish but wasn't even thinking about the Grand Prix at the time. I could've cried.
@wonkyalison Just opened the bbcsports app to check the football times n was greeted with F1 result on the homepage<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>. Made me think of you.

@DoodleChronicle Council cutbacks must include heating. Wear layers! Well done on such a good start to the day <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@BBCNews @suttonnick Hmm they haven't done that over the last 5 years.
@Earth_Pics haha is this the same one in your tweet @TraceyJPallett?
@DoodleChronicle I can easily lose a couple of hours on there. Good for when you need a distraction. The illustrations are so lovely too. X
@LaversCarolyne @AnxietyUnited I get that too. I think I'm so used to feeling that way that having nothing to worry about is unnerving.
@DoodleChronicle I love them. Do you like @pottermore too? Lots of interesting stuff written by JK Rowling. I'm a Hufflepuff.
@DoodleChronicle I'll see if they're in my library. It's great when you find a series that you just get lost in. It's Harry Potter for me!
@DoodleChronicle I'll make a mental note of the recommendation. Not read the book. Was an interesting choice given how you were feeling! X
@DoodleChronicle It was good to be honest. People just aren't used to others being so open about feeling bad. Shows she empathetic though.
It really winds me up when I hear someone say they 'had a panic attack' over something they found mildly irritating. If only they knew <UNAMUSED FACE>
@DoodleChronicle I use it too. I say it's time saving and energy saving therefore you're being very efficient with the resources at hand! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@TraceyJPallett Aww such an adorable face.

@Channel4 Question from my 9 yo: Why does your continuity announcer sound soooooo tired? Or is he bored? Hope he gets to watch the Simpsons.

@DoodleChronicle @beanie_buns @Justdreamingof That's awful. I'm sorry you were dismissed like that. It is NOT your fault.
@DoodleChronicle @beanie_buns @Justdreamingof That's terrible. I think you should have been offered a referral to a mental health team.
@DoodleChronicle Oh that's good. At least you won't worry about forgetting something. X
@DoodleChronicle I mean writing down what you want from GP, what you want to say, anxieties re doctors etc.
@DoodleChronicle I know it's been said before but I think writing some of this down will help it all become clearer in your own mind.
@DoodleChronicle I don't think it's ridiculous. It's bound to be scary speaking to GP about this for the first time.
@DoodleChronicle There are other professions that can help you too! It doesn't have to be just one at a time. X
@DoodleChronicle Feeling this way is understandable. You might need a psych to review your meds which could help with your thoughts.

@bexxc Same <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> I'd also feel ripped off if a bra lasted less than a year let alone 3 months. Apparently the elastane deteriorates.
@bexxc I don't even remember my last fitting. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@bexxc I know! That was my reaction. They've done a twitter chat tonight. They also recommend being measured every 6 weeks.
See the International Space Station fly over our heads tonight. Really easy to spot on a clear night. Go to @VirtualAstro for times etc.
According to @nextofficial, the lifespan of a bra is 3 months! <FLUSHED FACE>
@DoodleChronicle You're welcome x
@DoodleChronicle This might be useful x 
@DoodleChronicle A MH team will include a range of professionals who offer different services. You're more likely to get what you need.
@DoodleChronicle I'm sorry they reacted like that<ANGRY FACE> The GPs &amp;receptionists at my surgery are lovely so I know there are good ones out there!X
@DoodleChronicle You can list all your symptoms etc and if you struggle to say it all in the appointment you could just hand over the list.
@DoodleChronicle :-( Can you take someone with you? I also think it's a good idea to write it all down.
@DoodleChronicle Lots of them are very helpful. Although it's a hassle, you could change GP if the first one isn't understanding.
@learningtofloat Depends how bad it is but lots of fluids and rest are essential. At least you have a holiday to look forward to! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@learningtofloat It's awful having to do housework when you're ill. Back to bed as soon as you can. Get well soon xx
@DoodleChronicle your care and involve the professionals you need. I'm an OT student if you have any questions. X
@DoodleChronicle It should include psychiatrists, psychologists, a psych nurse and OTs. You might not need all of them but they'll discuss
@DoodleChronicle Well that's helpful! <CONFUSED FACE> I expect you'll be referred to a multi disciplinary team - if not, ask if it's possible.
@DoodleChronicle Have you ever been referred to a multi disciplinary mental health team? I think this is what you need. X
@DoodleChronicle You can have some of mine xx ((hugs))
@wonkyalison @DoodleChronicle Great idea. It probably saves time for them and you. Plus of course some things are easier to say in writing.

@DoodleChronicle I hope you're talking to someone. I don't want you to feel alone. Lots of love and hugs Xx
@DoodleChronicle What are you scared of? Do you need to talk?
One thing I need to keep reminding myself: I don't need to do it all today. Just a little bit today, there's time for the rest another day.
@99thRedBalloon That's a good strategy. Perhaps break up every hour with 45 mins study, 15 mins break.
I get more and more stressed&amp;anxious as the deadline approaches (therefore reduced productivity) so I need to get off to a good start.
I'd welcome any ideas/tips on how to do this. I have 'well done' stickers for my daughter which I might reward myself with on gd study days<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@Jinthelife Its eased off actually. Was hoping I could get some studying done in the sunshine but the cold is putting me off.
I also can't sit on the grass because it so muddy and full of puddles. <CONFUSED FACE>
Was feeling anxious at home so decided to go to the park in the sun. Now I'm here it's cold and breezy.
@DanAnxietyBlog @AnxietyUnited ((hugs)) x
@DoodleChronicle Hugs appreciated x
Feeling dizzy and more tired than normal this morning. Can I just crawl back in to bed?
@DoodleChronicle I'll DM you.
@DoodleChronicle <CRYING FACE>
Thinking through my assignment. Starting to get over this mental block which is good, but I'm berating myself that it didn't happen sooner.
@DoodleChronicle They are so lovely <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I can understand why they are a comfort to you. X
@JennieGow But savvy career move by Vettel. Great to see Mercedes have some real competition this year.
Think Alonso may be regretting leaving Ferrari right now. #F1 #MalaysiaGP
Without a doubt, @Lotus_F1Team are the best (and funniest) F1 tweeters. Always a pleasure. #MalaysiaGP
Got up very early for a Sunday to watch the Malaysian Grand Prix. Need. More. Coffee.
@DoodleChronicle You have a fussy eater then. I have one of those too. I've given up on serving mushrooms, peas or peppers.
I've totally lost interest &amp;enthusiasm for things that used to inspire me. Mental illness truly sucks but I know that it won't last forever.
Why does my head work so mercilessly against me? Shouldn't we be on the same side?
Thoughts with Jules Bianchi, still in a coma 5 months after his accident. #ForzaJules
@DoodleChronicle Good night, I hope you sleep well.
@TraceyJPallett @jamesgummer What has the world come to, when you can't trust your own sofa :-(
@TraceyJPallett @jamesgummer Ah yes, mine does that too!
@TraceyJPallett @jamesgummer What did the sofa do?
@DoodleChronicle a Depression and anxiety really sucks <PENSIVE FACE>
@DoodleChronicle It's alright. I love that you care. The main thing is to hand it in. Gutted that I won't get the mark I'm capable of tho.
@DoodleChronicle I've asked in the past and it's been a no.
@DoodleChronicle Great self care. Enjoy your yummy takeaway leftovers (always better the next day!) and snuggle up with book/film/piggies. X
#mentalhealth #mhsm #mhchat #quotes 
@DoodleChronicle I think I'm going to miss the deadline and get a penalty for late submission. :-(
I've realised why I'm struggling to get on w my assignment. I've completely lost my confidence. It's like I've forgotten how to write.
@99thRedBalloon Thank you xx Hugs to you to <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
Who regulates the newspapers? The tabloids should have to answer for their use of terrible stigmatising headlines.
Guilt and anxiety are winning today
@learningtofloat I think they were far too quick to announce what little info they had. Terrible reaction in the press.
We don't hear about the pilots who've had depression but not crashed a plane.
Following on from my rant about the mirror and the daily mail last night, THE SUN &lt; just as bad.
@DoodleChronicle I'm sure there are lots of people who are also glad you're here. <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
Perhaps the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail also refuse to employ people with a history of depression. They might burn the building down.
We don't have all the facts yet but certain papers have still demonised the co-pilot because he's had depression in the past.
The pilot may have been unconscious or there may be other factors we don't know about.
The Daily Fail are just as bad. Not surprised just very disappointed. Having depression does not make you want to kill hundreds of people.
Tomorrow's Daily Mirror front page <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> Why just state the facts when you can speculate and demonise ppl with mental illness. *shakes head*
#NeverHadItSoGood
#Batt…
Apparently Kay Burley is on the Cameron v Miliband programme. Another reason not to watch.
Not watching Paxman grill Cameron&amp;Miliband. I know how I'm voting &amp; doubt they could change my mind now. It'd just p me off n stress me out.
@queenmaz6 Thank you xx
@DanAnxietyBlog I'll set a timer. The assignment is split into sections so I'll try to do a bit on each section tonight.
@DanAnxietyBlog I'm thinking that I might just spend 15 mins on each section at first because I'm struggling to concentrate for very long.
@DanAnxietyBlog Thanks, I will. I struggle to focus on just one bit though because I worry that I won't have time for the other bits.
@DanAnxietyBlog I just want to stay in bed and hide from it. I don't think that's a good plan though.
@DanAnxietyBlog I'm glad you're doing ok. Keep going. How's the baby? Home from hospital now?
@DanAnxietyBlog V anxious tbh. I have an assignment to do &amp;the deadline is close but I can barely even think about it, let alone write it <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@DoodleChronicle Enjoy!
@DoodleChronicle Oooh yummy! I love Indian food. I haven't had a takeaway in ages.
@DoodleChronicle What did you order?
@Jinthelife I hope you got back to sleep easily. If I wake in the night, I'm like a zombie the next day. Hate it.
Don't know how to express what's going on in my head. I've drafted and deleted about 3 tweets already.
@DanAnxietyBlog Hey, how are you doing today? Sending hugs your way, if needed.
@DoodleChronicle You ARE worth saving. You're illness just likes to lie to you. I'm always here if you need to talk. Xx
@DoodleChronicle Hi honey, I wasn't online last night so just caught up on your recent tweets. Please know, you've helped me so so much.

@TinchyStryder Hehe <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @RachelRileyRR
@beth_1day Sorry you had such a bad day. Is there anything you can do this evening to make yourself feel a little bit better?
Why waste your time running a fake account impersonating a celebrity? Try reading a book instead or going outside and talking to people.
@A1MyLove4ever I think that is a fake account. Zayn is actually @zaynmalik &lt;This account is verified
@DanAnxietyBlog @AnxietyUnited Well done for continuing with therapy. You'll thank yourself for it one day.
@Jinthelife Looks delicious! X
@teatotally Oh I think it's in Bilbao actually.
@teatotally I'll make note. Is the Guggenheim in Madrid? I've been to the one in New York. It'd be nice to compare.
@teatotally I'd love to. I think it's in Madrid and I've always wanted to go. I've only been to Barcelona (I'm a Antoni Gaudí fan!).
@teatotally Sadly I haven't. I think it conveys the horror of war so well. The cliche 'a picture tells a thousand words' rings true.
@teatotally I remember having to write an essay on La Guernica. It was fascinating (the painting, not my essay!).
She just told me she's practicing for next Christmas <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Love my baby so much.
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> And all the angels sang for him... <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> I'm enjoying her lovely singing but I'm going to have to tell her to stop and go to sleep. <SLEEPING SYMBOL>
She's just finished Nat king Coles' Christmas Song <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> chestnuts roasting on an open fire... Then a bit of Silent Night.
I can hear my little one in her room. Instead of sleeping, she's singing christmas carols <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Winter wonderland and Away in a Manger so far.
@DoodleChronicle You are strong (like this piggie <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>). You have got through this before and you will again. Hugs Xx 
@DanAnxietyBlog @AnxietyUnited You can get through this! Deep breaths, take things one moment at a time. Big hugs xx
@MisElizaJane It was #Neighbours30thAnniversary last week. Are you still in touch with many of your former cast mates?
Lots and lots of writing to do... no idea where to start! <PERSEVERING FACE>
@mentalbattle Happy birthday lovely lady <PARTY POPPER><SHORTCAKE><BALLOON>
@DoodleChronicle I know <WORRIED FACE> He's really not going about this well. I think it's a good idea to request someone else. Xx
@DoodleChronicle I'm really angry on your behalf. You obviously know you are ill or you wouldn't have been referred to him. Xx
@DoodleChronicle His job is to help you to study despite your illness, not to go on about how ill you are. Grr! What was he expecting?!
@DoodleChronicle I hope he hasn't upset you. Hugs x
@DoodleChronicle Jeez, is that what he calls support?
@mentalbattle Ok :-)
@mentalbattle I hope you're ok now. X
@mentalbattle Ok, good. Dance as much as you want if you enjoy it. Xx
@mentalbattle Who's said this? Sending love and hugs xx
@99thRedBalloon I've got a kitchen timer out and ready :-)
@99thRedBalloon I have a deadline so baby steps might not be enough :-(
@99thRedBalloon Thank you x
@TraceyJPallett BBC2
Flight of the Navigator is on TV! One of my favourite films as a kid.
Feeling a bit hopeless. Wish I could just do the stuff I need to do instead of stressing n worrying about it and then getting nothing done.
@mentalbattle Well done, I hope you enjoy it too x
@susannareid100 That link explains those 'one weird tip' ads.
@susannareid100 
@DoodleChronicle Thank you, that's so nice of you. Xx
@DoodleChronicle Wow that'd be amazing! We're in Manchester. Xx
I now have an urge to watch Jurassic Park. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I love learning about dinosaurs and ancient history!
She 9 and <YELLOW HEART>s history documentaries and repeats of Time Team. I'd have loved to be an archaeologist too. Or a palaeontologist. #dinosauremoji
I seem to have passed on my <YELLOW HEART> of history. My daughter says she wishes she was an archaeologist because they have a really interesting job. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@DoodleChronicle Functional AND decorative, it's bound to bring you smiles :-) Well done.
@DoodleChronicle This is brilliant! What a great idea.
@Kara_Davies Its on BBC1 or online @VirtualAstro
@tommcfly Are you watching Buzz Aldrin live on BBC2?
@mentalbattle <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@mentalbattle No, you're amazing!
Given up on the idea of making a pinhole projector. I know it's going to be cloudy. I'll watch the #SolarEclipse live online @VirtualAstro.
@VirtualAstro What if it's cloudy in the Faroe Islands?
@depressednotsad I'm glad you had such a good day despite the anxiety and low mood. X
@DoodleChronicle Any guinea pig bridges in your new flat?
@DoodleChronicle It put a smile on my face and made me think of you too.
@Jinthelife Sounds like me in the mornings.
@DoodleChronicle A bit of guinea pig silliness for you. :-) 
@DoodleChronicle Yes, at least he's listening to you &amp; taking it into consideration. It might be helpful despite not being what u expected.
@DoodleChronicle It might just be the first session that's like that. He probably needed to discuss all that stuff in order to support you.
@DoodleChronicle <PENSIVE FACE> Sorry it wasn't what you'd hoped for. Xx
Watching @BBCStargazing Live. I've been really looking forward to this! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@DoodleChronicle Oh ok, I can understand that. Perhaps ring him tomorrow, if you can face it. Then at least you'd know. Xx
@DoodleChronicle Why don't you email and tell him you'd like more details. I'm sure you must have the right to know who has info about you.
@DoodleChronicle ... that it'll just lead to extra support being offered.
@DoodleChronicle I don't think you need to worry about action taken against you although I can understand your worry. I would expect ...
@DoodleChronicle I can understand that. I expect though that he has no choice to tell someone. It'll be in his professional code of ethics.
@DoodleChronicle Do you not agree that there's a risk? or did you not want people to know? Sending love and hugs xx
@DoodleChronicle Can smiling a lot be a bad thing?
@Herring1967 Well I hope your audience appreciate it so your embarrassment is not in vain.
Current solar storm means it could be possible to see Aurora Borealis in skies all over the UK tonight! Fingers crossed the clouds clear.
I had a wander round Manchester Central Library today for the first time. It's massive! I could spend hours in there and not get bored.
@99thRedBalloon Very true. I always say 'Everything will be ok in the end, if it's not ok, it's not the end'.
When things get tough, remember that everything will be ok in the end <RAINBOW>
@DoodleChronicle Your new place looks lovely. I love that there is so much colour and OWLS <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Had a lovely Mother's Day. Felt completely loved. <REVOLVING HEARTS>
Happy Mother's Day to all the Mums <REVOLVING HEARTS> I hope you have a wonderful day.
@Jinthelife The only magician I remember seeing as a kid was Paul Daniels. I even got his magic set for Christmas one year.
Should've gone to sleep a long time ago. I was hoping to be up at 5am for the Grand Prix. Oh well.
@Jinthelife I've not seen that. I don't know David Copperfield very well either.
@Jinthelife I just tried to google this but didn't find it.
@DoodleChronicle I can understand you wanting to protect her, but us Mums want to be able to look after our babies too. Xx
@DoodleChronicle If this happened with my daughter, I'd just be happy that she talked to me and that I have the chance to be there for her.
@B_Hartshorne Very stressful! Completely overwhelming at times.
@Jinthelife He was always good. This new programme called You're Back in the Room is not as good.
@Jinthelife Me too, I must've been about 10 and loved it. I remember my Mum always thinking it was a cruel making people do those things. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@B_Hartshorne I share your pain completely. Deadlines are a major stressor.
@greg_jenner @SarahMillican75 I love it too.
@mentalbattle ... in hypnotism anyway so viewers are never going to believe this programme's real even it actually is.
@mentalbattle I know it looks fake. I expected everyone to think that when I heard about it. I bet the majority of people don't believe ...
Who remembers the 90s TV show where Paul McKenna hypnotised some of the audience? #BackInTheRoom is basically the same programme no?
@wonkyalison I'll still be watching highlights later with family.
@wonkyalison I'm not keen listening on the radio either but I don't find it as exciting on the highlights because half is cut out.
@wonkyalison Thank you!
Anyone know where and when I can listen to the Aus GP live in the UK? Don't have Sky.
@DoodleChronicle Not too bad but I've felt guilty about not getting anything done. Really need a productive day tomorrow.
@DoodleChronicle Your Mum sounds nice. It's good that you'll have someone there to help unpack tomorrow.
@DoodleChronicle Slumber party! Wine and a film? Xx
#ComicRelief - Who got the Bishop job in Vicar of Dibley? Good candidate in Emma Watson, a UN ambassador for women. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
I'm on hold with the council. I really hate being on hold. They don't even play good music.
@DoodleChronicle Just think how good it will be tonight to be in your new home. Exciting times ahead!

@queenmaz6 Have a lovely time <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@DoodleChronicle It's not your fault, you've done nothing wrong at all.
@DoodleChronicle I'd just send her a text saying you're moving tomorrow and you're sorry you haven't seen her to tell her in person.
@BipolarBlogger Mine keeps saying 'tweets not loading right now'.
So sad about Terry Pratchett's death. He was a great man.
I'm shattered as I didn't sleep well last night and have stomach cramps too. Feeling sorry for myself so I've retreated back to bed.
@DoodleChronicle Well done! Keep going xx
@antonycotton Noooo the blackcurrant ones are the best. Last week I had a Rolo with no caramel inside, just chocolate all the way through!
@ManchesterMind I missed your twitter chat yesterday. Will you be doing one next week?
Some low level anxiety but going to push through it. Will get daughter from school in an hour, tidy flat, clean kitchen and make a curry! <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
This morning my mood was grey and dreary like the weather. Now I've had 2 nice phone calls to my mum and sister. Laughed lots. Mood lifted.
Picked my daughter up from school and gone to the park. It's getting cloudy and cold sadly but going to stay to do some reading.
@mentalbattle <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> This has made my day Claire. That's what I'm studying. It's so good to hear that a patient really gets what it's about.
Grr it's clouded over <SUN BEHIND CLOUD>️
It's so sunny today, I'm wondering if I should go and sit in the park to do my work. <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️
@DoodleChronicle Ok, and don't worry about it x
Good morning all. Here's hoping today is better than yesterday. The sun's out which usually puts me in a good mood. <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️
Looking forward to the new Formula 1 season. Hoping that Mercedes have more competition from the other teams this year. #F1 #AusGP
I'm going to pick up my angel from school soon. I am so ready for some cuddles.
How did it get to midday already! I've only just made a plan for the day. Better get going.
@Jinthelife Good night <SLEEPING SYMBOL>
@Jinthelife I know. Logical, rational thinking makes no difference to my emotions. Could it be because they are separate parts of the brain?
@DoodleChronicle @Jinthelife Probably other people don't notice or even give it a 2nd thought, meanwhile we wish the ground would open up.
@DoodleChronicle @Jinthelife I've been there. I reckon we're always a bit awkward when we're anxious. Think it's down to self esteem.
@Jinthelife <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@Jinthelife Thanks for the encouragement. I appreciate it x
@DoodleChronicle Thanks Molly, I might send you a DM later. Good luck with the search.
@DoodleChronicle Thank you, I need hugs. Did you see a flat you liked yesterday?
@Jinthelife It's hard to even make myself start. Just want to hide away and ignore everything.
@Jinthelife Thank you. I know this week is going to be difficult because I've got to do stuff I find stressful and anxiety provoking.
This week has got off to a terrible start. Not sure I have the strength to turn things round either. How do I become strong?
After seeing it on twitter for ages I've only just worked out what ICYMI stands for...
Feeling overwhelmed this morning. <PERSEVERING FACE>
@Gold_26 @Herring1967 Jeez that went quick!
@Herring1967 How long are you going to keep going? It's International Women's Day in the US for another 7 and a half hours...
@Herring1967 Do you always keep 8th March free for an all day tweetathon? Well done for educating people.
The 6 hour #danceathon on red button must be the best and most fun workout ever. I'm recording it for when I'm over this cold.
Great to see people of all ages at the #danceathon for @comicrelief. Go danceathoners!
Loving the music and dancing on the @comicrelief #danceathon. Took my mind off feeling poorly for a while. Watch on red button.
@Jinthelife @beth_1day Very addictive but fun.
@Jinthelife @beth_1day My daughter loves Tapped Out and now I've got sucked in too. It's my job to go on it when she's at her Dads.
Looking forward to watching the #ComicRelief danceathon on the red button from 12. Nice accompaniment to doing the ironing.
For all you amazing women. Have a good day ladies. #InternationalWomensDay 
@Jinthelife Thank you. Going to take it easy today.
Sending love to all international women <PURPLE HEART> #InternationalWomensDay  #girlpower
Morning everyone, hope you are all well. Im still feeling sorry for myself. Head banging and aching all over.
Need to think #selfcare - medication, will look for lemsip, brush teeth, then bed and a funny DVD for smiles.
I think I'm coming down with something. Head hurts, muscles ache and nose won't stop. Feeling sorry for myself. #moanytweet
@99thRedBalloon Thank you x
Feeling guilty that I've done none of the stuff I should have done today <PERSEVERING FACE><CRYING FACE> Early night and try again tomorrow?
Sister Sledge's performance was all over the place. Embarrassed for them.
@VirtualAstro Hello <WAVING HAND SIGN>
@DoodleChronicle Maybe you could Skype or FaceTime during the viewings so it's like she's seeing them with you. Just an idea. Good luck. X
@DoodleChronicle It wasn't very nice of her to keep you waiting so long. I can understand the anxiety. Can Mum help you look for somewhere?
@DoodleChronicle Aww you got them already, yay! I'm happy for you. They are so cute. Hope you are calmer now you are home.
@DoodleChronicle Good plan. I hope you have a relaxing weekend with Mum.
Why would any parent think it's ok for their child to dress up as Christian Grey for world book day?!
Great news that warm weather is on its way this weekend<BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️ Gutted that I'd planned on spending all weekend in the university library.<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@DoodleChronicle Our minds can be so cruel to us in how much they distort reality. I'm always here to talk if you need to. X
@DoodleChronicle You've said how nice your landlady is before. Perhaps things aren't as bad as you think they are? I hope it works out.
@jamiejaysheehan You put 'haha'.
“@jamiejaysheehan: I think I could be Bipolar. HaHa #BeingBipolar” You really think having bipolar disorder is funny?
@DoodleChronicle I know being on here helps you cope so keep it up. X
@DoodleChronicle I love how much you care about others. I don't think it's fair of ppl to criticise you for being honest on here though.
@greg_jenner Such a good idea.
Glad to see occupational therapy mentioned on the Great British Bake Off. #OT #GBBOComicRelief #GBBO
@heatherr_x To the police? We weren't bitten so I don't think it'd be taken that seriously. I'm not sure where they live either.
@heatherr_x She's not been around dogs much so having a cute puppy to play with is perfect.
@heatherr_x Me too, my parents have just got a puppy.
@heatherr_x I know! We're a bit bruised and grazed but otherwise ok.
My daughter clung to me and cried all the way home.
It had managed to escape from its collar and lead. The owner just shook his head in disbelief that it had happened. He didn't apologise.
She was screaming clearly terrified and it knocked her to the ground too. Only then did it's owner get to us and ask what happened.
Then it tried to get in my daughters lunchbox. My daughter wasn't right next to me but the dog heard her nearby, ran full speed towards her.
Just had a terrifying experience with a dog on the way back from school. Big dog ran really fast towards me, jumped up and knocked me over.
@MumsnetTowers @PoopingDinosaur Aaaah @tommcfly @DougiePoynter Look what kids are dressing up as for World Book Day!
This should include taxdodgers lik…
What can parents do to help their kids develop a realistic body image and healthy relationship with food? #askNL
If education on body image isn't gd enough it places a greater responsibility on parents who may not know how to address the issue. #askNL
Remember the pictures of size zero shop mannequins? Also models who are size zero or photoshopped to look that way. #askNL
Remember to use #askNL in replies
I think a major problem is that any education in school is contradicted by what fashion and media people promote as desireable. #askNL
“@LondonNightline: @naomi_1 Education, and changing the images that promote unhealthy sizes that surround everyone! Thoughts?” #askNL
How important is education on healthy body image in reducing number of ppl with eating disorders? Is current education sufficient? #askNL
@TheAppGarden I'm sure they would if it was helpful and user friendly. #askNL
@LondonNightline @DoodleChronicle Great! Thanks
@DoodleChronicle @LondonNightline Is this just for people in London?
Lovely and sunny in Manchester today. If it wasn't so cold, I'd spend all day sat in the park, listening to music and studying.
@Justdreamingof Staying in with a fire on sounds like a good idea. <SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW>️
@Justdreamingof Wow, is this where you are now?

@learningtofloat @roiben @Kitten_Fish Good luck with it. It probably won't be as bad as you're expecting. X
@learningtofloat @roiben @Kitten_Fish I can understand why that is so upsetting. *hugs* Have you tried speaking to your employer?
@learningtofloat Nothing wrong with that if it's what you need. Mums never stop caring, no matter how old you get.
@BuzzFeedUK Leave him there
@DoodleChronicle I know, but you are not responsible for them. You can put warnings in and if that's not sufficient they should unfollow. X
@DoodleChronicle I don't think anyone should have criticised you for it. You used trigger warnings so you did all you could. Xx
@DoodleChronicle I know others have said it but u should write whatever u want here especially if it helps you. It's your twitter account.
@DoodleChronicle You're not annoying. Fingers crossed for a better tomorrow. Sending lots of love and positivity your way X
@DoodleChronicle I can tell you pretty confidently that that is not the case. I've seen many people on here telling you the total opposite.
@DoodleChronicle Try not to beat yourself up over it. It's not a case of not trying hard enough. It's your mind working against you.
It's officially spring! Hopefully the sun will come out more often now and we'll be a bit warmer. Brrrrr
I open up and write honestly about struggling with mental health whilst at University.

#OffendEveryoneIn4Words Just pull yourself together
I am child free tonight! Whoop! Going to relax in front of the TV.
@BBCNews @bbcnickrobinson Best wishes to him for a speedy recovery.
@queenmaz6 @wonkyalison @P5BenWyvisPS Manchester, UK
@99thRedBalloon Totally agree!
@99thRedBalloon I want my daughter to know she can be any sexuality and it doesn't matter. I'd just want her to be treated equally.
@99thRedBalloon I think good education could stamp out so much hate, violence etc towards the lgbt community.
@99thRedBalloon I am just frustrated even though I'm straight because I see it as something majorly wrong with society.
@99thRedBalloon I hope our politicians, other than UKIP can see this is dark age thinking. Our kids have a right to be who they want to be.
@99thRedBalloon What we can teach however is that some people will be gay/bi and not to judge or discriminate them for it.
@99thRedBalloon There's a difference between promoting &amp;educating isn't there? I don't think you can teach someone to be gay/bi anyway.
@99thRedBalloon I was born in the 80s so don't remember it. What did it say?
We're all human and deserve to be treated equally. I want my daughter to know this and think it should be part of sex education. #lgbt
Surely it is about time that children were taught to be tolerant and non judgemental of people whatever their  sexuality.
Educating children about LGBT issues is the only way to build a society which is non-discriminatory towards people of all sexualities.
@99thRedBalloon She loves Jacqueline Wilson! I don't know what the characters look like though so I'll check with my expert.
The UKIP propaganda claiming that educating children in LGBT  issues as 'sexual grooming' to 'recruit fresh blood' makes me so mad.
I'm after costume suggestions for this years world book day. Need to be suitable for a 9 year old girl. Ideally free.
@wonkyalison @DoodleChronicle Guilt is a completely pointless emotion yet it always seems to be there.
@DoodleChronicle @wonkyalison Thank you xx
@DoodleChronicle @wonkyalison Instead I put things off and make it a whole lot worse. Then I feel more stressed and anxious.
@DoodleChronicle @wonkyalison Thank you both. I feel really silly though. I wish I had the courage just to face things and get things done.
@DoodleChronicle Anxious. I've been avoiding dealing with things, even simple things feel too hard. Just want to hide away from the world.
@DoodleChronicle Get well soon. Xx
@DoodleChronicle My favourite museum. I love learning about dinosaurs and ancient history. Enjoy it as much as possible and safe trip home.
#TheDress 
@heatherr_x I thought that too! How ironic. I really felt for her and the dancer must've felt awful.
@Netmums Oh #@#@! I'd forgotten about this. <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@DanAnxietyBlog That will be a relief for you I'm sure. Hope it all goes well.
@DanAnxietyBlog Thanks Dan! One small step at a time. How's the baby?
@AldiUK I don't speak baby. I wonder what it says.
I was forced to act and had to face things head on. I have a sense of relief about it but anxiety still high at the moment.
Been without Internet for a few days. How is everyone? I was full of panic earlier but I started to resolve some issues today.
@DanAnxietyBlog @GreenFlagUK Good for you for posting this.
It's #The100 S2 Ep 8 on e4 tonight. I know what happens. It's gonna be emotional. Will need tissues! <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Despite having a moan, on the whole I've really enjoyed #Broadchurch S2. The finale was good but grim.
Obviously they want to keep us guessing but that's just a cop out. When you invest time in a show you want some pay off. #Broadchurch
So are we to assume Joe did kill Danny or not? Disappointed that it wasn't made clear. #broadchurch
I wonder how many people are going to be saying "yeah that's what I thought happened" #broadchurch
@heatherr_x Yes, no cliff hangers tonight please!
@heatherr_x I can't take this! What is going to going to happen?!
WTF!! Who then?! #Broadchurch
Fully caught up with #Broadchurch so I can watch the finale tonight. Will Joe be found guilty? (Hopefully yes!) &amp; who killed Pippa?

Clearly didn't have my head together last night. Instead of bringing my mobile to bed, I brought the TV remote from the lounge.
Was restless last night. Couldn't switch my mind off to sleep so was reading a book until at least 3am. Long lie in today. Feel groggy now.
@greg_jenner What has the Telegraph done now? I think ive missed something.
Woman on #gogglebox at start of Basic Instinct "Is it a Disney film?" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@VirtualAstro Alas, yet again there is too much cloud to see anything. <WORRIED FACE>

@dreams_violet I made it to bed, yay! I usually put a DVD on my laptop in my room. Often struggle to fall asleep.
@dreams_violet I watch late night re-runs of comedy shows because I can't be bothered taking myself to bed! Like now for example ha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@dreams_violet I end up watching random stuff just because it's on. It's a huge time waster.
I knew there was a reason I never watch Eastenders. Terrible.
@ironic2014 @DoodleChronicle It seems lots of other people can too. It's good to know.
@Kitten_Fish That's amazing! Well done x
A cuddle makes everything better “@Earth_Pics: A baby baboon snuggled with a teddy bear 
@mrdouglaswood Yes I agree. It makes me feel better to know I may have helped someone else. Therapeutic in a way.
@ManchesterMind I enjoyed it. I hope you do this often.
@mrdouglaswood I always feel like a burden on people. Its not so bad on twitter because I can offer support in return.
@mrdouglaswood it's only fairly recently that I started opening up twitter and I've found it takes time. I still struggle with being honest.
@TraceyJPallett @ManchesterMind #talktwitter ...I've found the support more genuine and personal than other other online sources of support.
@TraceyJPallett @ManchesterMind #TalkTwitter Yes I do but I find it hard face to face. Since I started reaching out on Twitter I have ...
@TraceyJPallett @ManchesterMind I'm never sure if I want to admit publicly how I feel, knowing that anyone could see it. #TalkTwitter
@TraceyJPallett @ManchesterMind I sometimes struggle with how public it is. Probably because I feel shame and guilt. #TalkTwitter
I'm more honest about how I feel with twitter friends than I am in 'real' life. I think it helps to be behind a screen #TalkTwitter
Join twitter chat about using twitter for mental health support #TalkTwitter @ManchesterMind
@ManchesterMind forgot hashtag #TalkTwitter
@ManchesterMind Not necessarily. The main thing for me is that I worry less about judgement, shame n pity than I do when face to face.
@DoodleChronicle you're welcome. Hope you've been ok today.
@ManchesterMind Yes, because it's enabled me to connect with people who understand in a way that family n friends can't.
You can help save a man from a needless and unjustified execution and you can do it with just a couple of clicks.

I love you all twitter friends <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
Finally got up to get milk from shop. So it is pancakes for tea! Need to find a good recipe. Not sure which one I used last year.
@Herring1967 You seem to go to the post office a lot. Unless you've  actually just been in the same queue all this time.
@Ladybird_Donna Take it easy today. I hope you feel better soon <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Just remembered its Tuesday which means #The100 is on tonight! I'm loving this show. My day just got better.
I want to make pancakes but that means I have to go to the shop for milk... Nooo I don't want to move!
I didn't achieve what I needed to yesterday so I'm disappointed with myself but I did get other stuff done. So not a total waste of a day <CONFUSED FACE>
@DoodleChronicle Hope you have a better day today. *hugs* 
@NorthernMunky thanks
@DoodleChronicle You don't need to apologise. You help lots of people too Molly, it's ok to need support in return. Xx
I lost interest in Broadchurch and didn't watch the last 4 episodes. I recorded them though. Is it worth catching up? #Broadchurch
@DoodleChronicle Good I'm glad. X
@DoodleChronicle Thank you Molly. Have you had something for tea? Look after yourself x
It was good to distract myself with something productive. Keeping my mind busy and giving myself a sense of accomplishment.
I'm proud of myself. Planning ahead so that I still have something nutritious to eat on days when I have zero motivation to cook. Go me!
Despite feeling the way I do, I managed to make a bolognese. Added lentils to make it go further so I can freeze extra portions.
@DoodleChronicle Can't help it. You care about all of us too.
@learningtofloat @CharleysKitchen Its bad 'cause I miss important things as well as every day stuff. Get myself into all sorts of trouble.
@learningtofloat @CharleysKitchen I get bad anxiety around calls, texts, email, letters &amp;people at door. Ignoring all of them at the moment.
@wonkyalison With popcorn too! Perfect.
Going to snuggle up with my little one and watch Tangled to shut the world out and avoid reality for a couple of hours. <PRINCESS>
@DoodleChronicle Sending hugs <YELLOW HEART> I hope things get better for you soon.
How do you find the courage to do something you've been putting off because it causes you fear and panic? <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
@bdogrunner thank you x
Feeling very anxious today. Need to sort my life out but don't have the strength. Sorry for the negative tweets, just feeling low atm.
@BipolarBlogger Thanks for reminding me it was on! Recording now.
She also made me a cup of tea for the first time ever (with supervision). She's all grown up.
My amazing 9yo has been helping w housework today. She did a load of laundry and put it out to dry. Cleaned microwave and tidied lounge. <PURPLE HEART>
@greg_jenner Completely agree. What a stupid idea. I hope people don't see it as an endorsement.
@DoodleChronicle I hope you don't feel like that when we tell you how wonderful you are, because it's all true. Even if you can't see it. <GLOWING STAR>
@heatherr_x <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> They'll never be able to put their music career behind them will they. I love Ant n Dec. So glad Takeaway is back.
@Justdreamingof Nurses are amazing! Respect <HEART DECORATION>
Made cup of tea. Discovered there's no milk. Fml.
Yeah I'm sure this is legit “@4t88sxk5il9: You are  todays *Prize*Patrol Manchester selection @naomi_1 Claim at this page @_U_K_Claim”
@heatherr_x It's very funny so far!
@heatherr_x Well I'm glad you enjoyed the gig and Manchester. You back home now then? I'm watching ant n dec on Jonathan Ross.
@heatherr_x I know what you mean. The city centre can get so busy especially on Sat. I have fun for the 1st hour or so then want to home.
@heatherr_x No worries, let's meet up next time. What did you get up to while you were here?
@heatherr_x I do! Were you here long?
@heatherr_x Yehhh Manchester! How was the concert?
Today I asked my 9yo what she's giving up for Lent. 

She said 'school'.
@heatherr_x I agree with her to be honest. It's everywhere!
My 9yo daughter said 'There is just too much romance stuff around today' in disgust.

@mentalbattle It's good you have someone to help. Good luck getting it sorted.
@mentalbattle Is there a library near you? Most have computers u can use for free.
@mentalbattle I save stuff to Dropbox too so I can access it from anywhere. You should try something like that if you can access it later.
@mentalbattle Ah no <WORRIED FACE> Is it all saved on the laptop or do you have it on a memory stick?
@mentalbattle If it doesn't work, switch off, leave on charge and try again in a few hours.
@mentalbattle Don't worry, it happens to mine sometimes. Try pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del at the same time.
@mentalbattle Is it fully charged?
Struggling at the moment. Panic keeps washing over me in waves.
@Ginge94 Thank you so much x
@DoodleChronicle I think it depends on the GP. One of my GPs got me to do questionnaire every visit. Others never mentioned it.
@dreams_violet Look after yourself tonight. I hope tomorrow is better. X

@DoodleChronicle and I find assignments do tend to make me very stressed and anxious.
@DoodleChronicle It helps me to get away from the house/library. A neutral setting is less anxiety provoking when it comes to assignments.
@DoodleChronicle Do you go to coffee shops to study? I like to do that.
@learningtofloat It's good. Also got stronger steroid and noticed an improvement in just a couple of hours. Feels such a relief.

@DoodleChronicle Good I think. I asked to be referred for counselling which is something I've been considering for years. Bit jittery now.
So cold today. I need a hot water bottle and a coffee! <SNOWFLAKE>️<HOT BEVERAGE>️
@learningtofloat I've seen GP and was given Hydromol, similar to Epaderm. Love it already.
@DoodleChronicle Do you see this as a good thing? Appointments can help to keep you mind focused. Hope u r ok. I've just got back from GP.
@DrLawyercop @cwbello You're not making any friends here Aaron...
@Kitten_Fish thank you x
Feeling anxious about GP appointment tomorrow morning. Going to try to sleep now. Don't want to sleep in.
@DoodleChronicle @roiben A card would be ok. You could always post it to her.
It's sad isn't it, that I just got excited at th thought of a brand new episode of Midsomer Murders on tonight. Only good thing about today.

@devbostick How to do a Scottish accent 
@learningtofloat Yeah it could be lots of things. It's always hard to pinpoint because it takes so long for me to get it back under control.
@learningtofloat I need new steroid. I was on something mild but eczema has gotten much worse recently. Poss stress or side effects of meds.
@learningtofloat Oh good! I've been using aqueous cream but think something thicker and waxier like Epaderm will be better.
@learningtofloat My brother uses Epaderm and said its good. I'm going to ask GP about it on Thurs. Not heard of that steroid though.
@learningtofloat What do you use?
@learningtofloat I can't get any relief from it at the moment and feel self conscious about it in public. Finally going to GP on Thursday.
@learningtofloat I have eczema too. Do you find it gets you down when it's sore? It does for me.
Dementia patients able to live as normally as poss in this purpose built facility. Much better than our care homes. 
@BenHatch Hopefully someone will keep note of where they all are. Would be a very nasty surprise to find one months down the line.

@2000Adi They just get remembered in the discipline they are best known for, which I think would be tv for both of them.
@2000Adi Mayall and Smith were TV actors and would be remembered at TV baftas not the film awards. Hoskins prob should have been mentioned.

@DoodleChronicle That is so lovely. You are lucky to have such amazing support. <GLOWING STAR>
@DoodleChronicle Then say 'I think I need that, can you help me?' Be honest and say you are struggling and it hard to put into words atm.
@DoodleChronicle Could you approach it differently and call them to ask what they do, as a conversation starter (even if you already know)

@learningtofloat @LibraryofBham Oh that's good. I hardly ever read magazines because it gets quite expensive buying them every week.
@learningtofloat Yeah me too. When I'm feeling low, reading is too much effort and when I'm anxious it's hard to focus.
@learningtofloat @LibraryofBham We have Twilight, which I'm not interested in and The Notebook which I've heard is good.
@learningtofloat @LibraryofBham What about their Ebooks?
@learningtofloat @LibraryofBham Just checked, we have 45 audiobooks which is less than I thought.
@learningtofloat Quite a lot but many of them are books I wouldn't want to read anyway. I'm the same with returning books.
@learningtofloat @LibraryofBham Was it a download? I've done that from my library before. It's good if you don't want to go out to library.
@learningtofloat She should be empathetic then.
@learningtofloat that's enough to cope with when you are feeling low! Don't beat yourself up. X
@learningtofloat Is she a good friend? If so I don't think she'd mind. Maybe text her to explain how you feel if she doesn't already know.
@learningtofloat You achieved lots yesterday so tell yourself, I deserved a break today. X
@learningtofloat It doesn't sound like today was wasted. Meeting up with friends is good for you too. It's like a different type of therapy.
@learningtofloat Yes you will. Don't be too hard on yourself. Forget about today and plan how you could make tomorrow a better day.

About time she was taken down a peg or two. "Tweets posted by Katie Hopkins about the Glasgow #Ebola case are being examined by police"
@heatherr_x Yeah I know, I don't begrudge them having holidays but don't want to hear about it all the time.
@heatherr_x By posting about it it's like they're saying 'look how well I'm doing, look how successful my career is'.
@heatherr_x Yh I noticed Rochelle's post. Perfectly timed.
@heatherr_x Aimed at anyone in particular?
Glad to be saying goodbye to 2014. Here's hoping 2015 is a happier one.
@raiderfra @mrchrisaddison You can choose a male or female voice in settings.
So happy that the lovely @Sheridansmith1 has been given an OBE in the New Year honours list.
#deathlyhallows ending is awful in the film. So anticlimactic. Should have stuck more faithfully to the book.
I really wanted Draco to change to the good side after he was saved by Harry, Ron and Hermione again. Think he saw error of his ways but...
I love reading the bit in the train station after Voldy kills Harry 'cause we get answers. Answers we waited so long for #deathlyhallows
Of course the books are better than the films but isn't that always the case. #deathlyhallows
I'm in my thirties now and I still love the Harry Potter books as much as when I first read them. They are classics #deathlyhallows
@heatherr_x @Mattdavelewis DH is where Neville finally sticks 2 fingers up at all the bullies and becomes a hero. A really positive message.
@themichaelowen Think you're in the dog house Michael!
@themichaelowen Haha I can't believe you wrote that! Are you drunk?
Awful news from Indonesia. I feel so sad for the families. At least they will get closure. Families of MH370 passengers are still waiting <CRYING FACE>
@daraobriain I'm sure it will be great, I love the show. March seems ages away though!
Thinking of Jules Bianchi and Michael Schumacher at the end of a difficult year for both of them. #ForzaJules #KeepFightingMichael
@heatherr_x I need to do this too. I started before Xmas but didn't finish the job and now have bags full of stuff lying around in my way.
Presents all over my lounge since Xmas n need to find them homes. Can't be bothered but the mess is stressing me out. <CONFOUNDED FACE>
I get stressed out by mess. It brings down my mood &amp; makes me anxious but I find housework hard when I'm not mentally strong. Vicious cycle.
@StandUp4Suicide @DoodleChronicle What a lovely idea!
@Justdreamingof They already know but haven't spoken to them in a while and need to do this in new year. I'm sure I'll feel better for it.
@Justdreamingof @DoodleChronicle And then feel guilty for not using!
@Justdreamingof @DoodleChronicle Feel like a burden asking for help too many times. Expect tutors to roll their eyes and think bad of me.
@Justdreamingof @DoodleChronicle I can relate to having nice things &amp;not using them. My mind tells me I'll spoil them or don't deserve them.
@Justdreamingof @DoodleChronicle Hi, I noticed in your bio that you are a nurse. I'm an OT student. MH issues making it hard work though.
@DoodleChronicle @Justdreamingof Thank you <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Justdreamingof @DoodleChronicle I like the look of that.
When you have depression, just doing everyday things are a challenge and massive achievement. Getting dressed can take all day sometimes.

@scd_support 11/10/2014 ?
@scd_support Simon and Kristina's Argentine Tango?
@scd_support Is it Scott and Joanne's crab dance?
@scd_support Frankie and Kevin show dance?
@heatherr_x Thank you <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> x
I've had bouts of depression &amp; anxiety for years. It comes &amp; goes but I've been quite low recently. Can any of my followers relate?
@DoodleChronicle Sending you lots of love Molly <KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES> I'm going through it too. It's hard enough w/o horrible people being deliberately mean. Xx
@DoodleChronicle Facebook always makes me feel sad so I've stopped using it. Twitter is better x
Watching Harry Potter on itv is giving me the urge to read book 7 again. #DeathlyHallows
Doesn't feel like a Saturday today. Strictly isn't on TV for a start.
@BoybandsMyLove Not personal, people just have different interests. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@BoybandsMyLove Exactly, ppl can unfollow 'cause they only want to see tweets about stuff they're interested in.
@BoybandsMyLove Have you never unfollowed anyone? I have, but it doesn't mean they did anything to offend me.
@BoybandsMyLove Everyone loses followers sometimes. Try not to take it personally.
Aww Mr Carson <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #Downton
@sitdowncomedian He was in the #TextSanta special.

#TheWrongMans is so good, I'm hoping it gets a new series. @realmatbaynton and @JKCorden are brilliant.
My heart goes out to the victims &amp; their loved ones. Also for the witnesses who will be traumatised. Don't know how u get over seeing that.
Can't imagine how hard It must be for families of those who've died, especially the victims' children. Worst ever Xmas ahead. So sad.
Can't take in what has happened Glasgow. Feel sick thinking about it. So awful for victims' families, friends and ppl who witnessed it. RIP
@keviclifton Voted for you every week! Hope you n Karen have a magical Xmas in NYC and I wish you all the best for 2015 xx
@FrankieTheSats Wishing you and your family a magical Christmas <SNOWMAN WITHOUT SNOW>️<SNOWFLAKE>️ Hope you have a chance to rest, you deserve it. Xx

@scd_support Yay!
@fatherbananas He's still waiting for his first 40 too.
Meh <SMIRKING FACE>
Caroline must feel she has it in the bag #scd
Easy to forget how many other couples have been on the series and not made it. This series flew by. #scd

@scd_support Seriously? Over marked yet again and Frankie undermarked.
@heatherr_x wow a 40, how did you predict that? <SMIRKING FACE>
Caroline will get 40 for her show dance. Predictable
That was AMAZING! 40! #scd
@the_karenhardy You have nice things to say about everyone but who do you think has best technique? I know who my favourite is.
Could hav guessed these scores based purely on the judges choice of dance. Their pick for Caroline was a 'wow' dance 1st time round. #scd
Meh
@DoodleChronicle Well done!
Would LOVE Frankie to get 40 for one of her dances tonight, she deserves it. For Kevin too cause he's never had a 40 on strictly. #scd
@The_OlaJordan Hope your leg gets better soon
@DoodleChronicle @CharitySANE This is great! Thank you. I'm going to give it a go <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> x
@DoodleChronicle @CharitySANE That's very kind, thank you x
@DoodleChronicle @CharitySANE I like the idea of a ditch the dog box! Any ideas what I should put in it?
Please share. 
Fleur's going to be the star because she's the runner up. Ben will be a nobody 18 months from now. Sad but seems to be how X Factor goes.
Not been watching live X the factor shows properly but whenever I've heard Ben he sounded awful.

#depression #anxiety #mentalhealth  #TimetoTalk 
@The100writers Aaaah so excited! Thank you!
@The100writers Too many spoilers on here! I'm muting you until it's back on in the UK. Which hopefully won't be long.
@heatherr_x ok x
@TeamFrankieee Saved me some pennies on my phone bill. Result
@TeamFrankieee It just let me do it on my phone too. I don't think we're supposed to be able to do that <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@TeamFrankieee Hmm that's not what it says on the website. Will try it now.
@MarkWright_ You deserve to be there next week! I voted for you. X
@TeamFrankieee No, only 3 votes per BBC ID login. Votes on other devices all count towards your 3 unless you use a different login.
Jake should go this week but he has such strong support he might even avoid dance off. I worry for Mark and Simon. #scd #strictly
Darcey has said publicly that she wants Jake to win. She should be impartial. Unfair. #favouritism #scd #strictly
I wish Tess would stop talking over the judges, always wanting to stick her opinion in. #scd #strictly
@collymac Naughty Bruno <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Are you allowed to say 'cock-up' on the BBC?! <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #scd
What is that on Craig's face? <NEUTRAL FACE> #scd
They really should ditch the judges dancing entrance. #scd #strictly
@markydeedrop Clearly underprepared however bad it is. Metro boss said it was unusual &amp; extreme conditions but come on, we're in Manchester!
I don't understand how #Metrolink can be so badly affected by winter weather. Why was nothing done to prepare for this?
@EamonnHolmes @RuthieeL Maybe it's not what you said but the way you said it? <SMIRKING FACE>
@heatherr_x What is it you're worried about?
@RobbieSavage8 Hope it tasted better than it looks
@DoodleChronicle I know what you mean, I have good and bad days with my mood and anxiety. Take things slowly, one step at a time. X
@heatherr_x He is funny but I watch him through my fingers at times! I wonder if they think all British ppl are like Joey.
@DoodleChronicle How was your appt? I hope you can see some light at the end of the tunnel.
Watching Educating Joey Essex. I watch this mainly for @Schofe's voice over. Brilliant.
@DoodleChronicle Think of something you enjoy doing that you could do after the appt. Treat yourself, you deserve it. X
@DoodleChronicle Sorry to hear that. What could you do to make yourself feel better? Can you plan something to look forward to?
@ThisisDavina I have PCOS so need to cut down on sugars. I'm really interested to read your book.
@Lancs_FireDCFO Brilliant acting by @Jason__Watkins
@SCDTeamFrankie @scd_support @Clifton_Bridge I think their music for both dances are great. AT could be as good as her paso or tango.
@SCDTeamFrankie @scd_support @Clifton_Bridge I don't believe in conspiracies. M&amp;K also doing rumba and everyone else has done 1 so it's fair

#KeepFightingMichael
#ForzaJules 
@scd_support Yes you're right, deep breaths, it'll be fine <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<THUMBS UP SIGN> Love their music and glad she gets to do an AT! Back to top of leaderboard!
@scd_support @Clifton_Bridge Noooo tis what I feared. Frankie and Kevin are doing the dance of doom, the Rumba! Dum dum duuummm!
#mindfulness
@DoodleChronicle Thinking of you. I know things are hard right now but they won't always be that way. X
Noooo I forgot to put DVDs by @SarahMillican75 and @mermhart on my Xmas list! <WEARY FACE>
@bbcstrictly It wasn't the illegal lifts that caused their exit, it was her technique on that dance. She's good but Simon was better in DO.
@VirtualAstro Very true, just wish we had better weather here. Always seems to be cloudy.
Darcey Bussell says that she would like Jake to win Strictly. Are the judges allowed to show such favouritism? #scd 
@msnhatesclaire I never wear white either. It looks like an off-white though. If you already have red, I'd go for something different.
@msnhatesclaire White


@keviclifton @bbcstrictly @FrankieTheSats It was quite a reaction from you when you got through. Well done! What dances do you have?
“@scd_support: So we're shocked and a tad emosh. Do you think the right couple went home?” Based on this week, yes. #scd
The judges shouldn't make the final decision imo. It gives them the chance to bump off their own acts' biggest competition. #xfactor
Just seen the strictly spoiler result <WEARY CAT FACE>
Oh dear @MarianKeyes will not be happy
Jake and Janette's charleston gets a 9 from me and only a 7 from my little one. She's a harsh critic!
Tess talks too much. #scd
Jake's kids are so sweet #scd
What? No ten? Mark was really good this week and deserved a higher score #scd
@scd_support 10 from us
Pixie and Trent's cha cha - very pink! She's so good but we still prefer Frankie here #scd
Kiera doesn't like the Argentine Tango. Not happy w scores - apparently Bruno just copies Len's! Ooh controversial.
@scd_support haha! my daughter didn't like the clothes either. She said 'I'm not being rude but the colours just don't go together' v fussy
Kiera (my 9 yr old) doesnt like this dance between Simon and kristina. Too much jumping and she said he shouldn't stick out his elbows.
Time for @bbcstrictly! Come on @FrankieTheSats and @keviclifton! Salsa baby!
@bbcstrictly She'd love @ZoeTheBall to see her designs in the hope that she'll show them to Vicky Gill.
My daughter (Kiera, 9yrs) loves @bbcstrictly and designed some dresses for the show. 
@THERussellGrant Condolences to you and your family x
@DoodleChronicle Good luck, be strong x
Why are itv2 so against Mel? This discussion on #ImACeleb is very one sided. All comments I've seen on twitter were in support of Mel.
I thought Michael would have been a worthy King of the Jungle. Shame he's out so early #ImACeleb
@imacelebrity Edwina gets on my nerves too and I'm not having to live with her so I don't blame Mel.
@scd_support Aww that's so sweet! What a cool Dad he is.
@scd_support Didn't know his daughter was born on Xmas day. That must be so difficult.

@DoodleChronicle Has this recognition all happened since you were retweeted by Mind the other day? If so, that is really quick!
@DoodleChronicle Well done on being featured by the Guardian. You must be so thrilled. X
@VirtualAstro You buy your followers eh? I think you owe me money then <WINKING FACE>
@heatherr_x @imacelebrity Aw <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> I think some of the others are funny too. I hope we'll see more of them now.
I wonder how many of the ppl complaining actually voted for Jimmy? #ImACeleb
@heatherr_x @imacelebrity I used to think so too but have gone off him completely. I'm fickle <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Michael to win! <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@heatherr_x @imacelebrity He wasn't very nice over the last few days and he was irritating. Glad he's out. Soz <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
YES!! Jimmy is out! #ImACeleb
@FrankieTheSats I bet it's the American Smooth!
@schofe Is there somewhere we can check what you will be doing and when? I'll tune in as much as possible. Good luck <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@MrsGiFletcher My top tip - frozen bananas to chew/bite on. He won't choke cos they defrost slowly and go mushy so also a tasty snack. Xx
@MrsGiFletcher Get the teethers in the fridge pronto! Good luck xx
@VirtualAstro Thanks! I really hope the sky is clear over Manchester on 24th December.
@VirtualAstro haha me too
@TracyC007 that's true!
@VirtualAstro I think you like the drama!
@TracyC007 I hope when he gets out that he watches it back and sees people's comments. Might make him see it differently.
@VirtualAstro Whhaaat? Heard nothing here in Manchester. What is going on?
@TracyC007 Banter or not, I didn't like it.
Have really gone off Jimmy after tonight's show. Showed an ugly side to him even though he says it's just banter. #ImACeleb
@scd_support We're seeing a lot of Trent's wife this series. If Trent returns in 2015, I'd bet anything Gordana will be 1 of the pros too.
@RachelRileyRR You're completely unbiased of course <WINKING FACE> Thought they were fab.
@scd_support The theme would have been fine if they'd not been given stupid combinations of dance and music. #scd
@TrentWhiddon @GordanaGW @bbcstrictly Nice knees <THUMBS UP SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JManrara You didn't deserve such harsh comments and scores.
@scd_support I didn't think you'd actually do it! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> well done, muy bien <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
@scd_support Are you also going to write that in Greek, Dutch, Austrian...?
@scd_support  It's not an Argentine tango if it has a Greek theme. I know it's not their fault. It's those darn producers again.
I think Frankie was under-marked this week #scd
Len's the only judge worth listening to #scd
After they finish dancing I mute cos I can't listen to Tess, Craig or Darcey. I unmute for Len and sometimes Bruno. #scd #Strictly
Can't believe we have to wait until December 2015!!!! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> #StarWars
@Herring1967 I don't think I've seen you tweet this much since the last international women's day.
@Reallisariley Apart from the fact that you can also stay warm and dry while doing it. It's a win.
@heatherr_x I love them!
@heatherr_x Just seen that was ant and dec's hashtag. (I'm about 10 mins behind). They're on fire tonight <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@heatherr_x Let me know if that hashtag takes off <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@imacelebrity It's so cringey.
@keviclifton @joanneclifton @bbcstrictly She's not going to drop this. Only thing you can do is win strictly so you have a good comeback.

Edwina to Michael: "You're fascinated by her. Like an animal in a zoo?" said with smirk on face. Horrible woman #ImACeleb
Not a fan of Kendra but Edwina Currie is an awful woman. She epitomises everything I hate about the Tories and politics in general #ImACeleb
I bet @Schofe will enjoy tonight's live trial #ImACeleb #crittercube
@scd_support Good job that first item is already on its way or she'd be having to wait 9 months!
@scd_support Also two female dancers I think. I think it's aliona and anya but might be wrong.
@VirtualAstro Well Santa Claus does have to visit the astronauts on the ISS too so he might be there when we're looking.


@ClaudiaWinkle I'm glad she's on the mend. Lots of love to you and your family. X

Toxic for Lab but apparently par for the course for Tories..

Go figure eh!

@imacelebrity <WEARY FACE> Noooo I cannot stand Edwina Currie and don't watch X Factor so really disappointed. Was hoping for better. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>

@scd_support Top of the class - Jake and Simon looking particularly good in training.
@scd_support Tim won't go, he's so endearing. It'll be Judy I think.
@scd_support Oh ok <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> Thanks

@ToriBMakeUp @keviclifton @FrankieTheSats @RealNatalieLowe Natalie's looking a bit different in this pic...
@scott_mills @keviclifton Sorry for what? What did I miss?
@scd_support 3 Disney songs! The kids are going to be happy... And maybe one or two grown ups too.

Then RT it. 
@CliftonKeith @keviclifton @FrankieTheSats Yes they're on tonight. I think their paso is going to be great.
@bbcstrictly OMG @MarkWright_ dressed as Superman!
@jk_rowling Did you get much work done in the end? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> Thank you, this was fun!
@jk_rowling @percafect @Austinterlude 'Depart' can't be in it as there's no 'p' in the anagram...
@scd_support Something from My Fair Lady or Breakfast at Tiffany's for @FrankieTheSats &amp; @keviclifton cos she looks like Audrey Hepburn #scd
@scd_support My 8yo suggested Peter Pan - @FrankieTheSats or @PixieLott would make a good tinkerbell <DIZZY SYMBOL>
@scd_support My daughter has suggested loads but most have been done last couple of years (toy story, chitty chitty bang bang, Shrek)
@scd_support Are you going to do a twitter chat on which films should be done in Hollywood week?
@karen_hauer @keviclifton The two of you are so cute together!
@JessieTurner09 Definitely 5 votes last year! Perhaps they lost money from phone votes so reduced it to 3.

@Robinwindsor @judmoo You're so lovely Bobby. Wish you could've been on this series.
@TeamFrankev @keviclifton Friday. Zoe tweeted Kevin last night.
@RobbieSavage8 Hope she's better and out of hospital soon. Sending love x
@scott_mills You must be waiting for same train as @karen_hauer. It's so annoying especially when you're tired and just wanna get home.
@scd_support Tough! Having a guess at Natalie.

@scd_support Can you imagine the rivalry for this years pro challenge between Joanne and Kevin?
@scd_support Ah it was Kevin Clifton and it was Guinness world record for drunken sailors I think.
@scd_support Pasha? Salsa?
I've got to stop reading the comments below online articles and videos. Some people are just so rude and nasty.
@CliftonKeith A nicely written column. Looking forward to more.

@scott_mills No way should you be at the bottom. That's just a joke. Good luck with training this week. X
@FrankieTheSats Well done! You smashed it like I knew you would. @keviclifton and the girls must be so proud. Bring on the Latin!
I love Claudia! So funny and the show is much smoother now Tess and Claudia are presenting together. #scd

@MarkWright_ @bbcstrictly Good luck to you and @karen_hauer for your dance. Know you'll be fab.
@MCRMetrolink The barriers at Navigation Road station are broken. They are down and people just climbing over to get across the track.

@scd_support Frankie and Kevin mainly but I'd also like Caroline, Alison, mark and Steve to do well. Like lots of them this year.
@scd_support Lisa Riley?

I don't get a vote but I'd be really sad if Scotland left the Union. I think Salmond is being really reckless.
Salmond has an inferiority complex. He's putting Scotland's future on the line to boost his ego. Self–important idiot.
The future's bright, the future is red #MUFClive
Manchester United back on form. This is more like it!!
The commentator on radio 5 live cannot say Rojo's name. Keeps calling him Rocco.
Twitter &gt; Facebook !!!


I mean how many teens actually care about the economy? They likely to vote for some idealised view of ind Scotland sold to them by Salmond.
That Salmond's a sly bugger. Give 16/17 yr olds a vote because most will be too young to understand possible consequences of a yes.
Are 16 n 17 yr olds really allowed to vote in Indy ref? Not old enough to vote in Gen election but old enough to decide Scotland's future?
Bloody Katie Hopkins is on Celeb Juice this week :( Might be the first ever episode that I don't watch.

@heatherr_x I know, it is worrying. Especially now its over 24 hrs.
@heatherr_x Hmm it is strange, but kids are trusting. If someone said 'Mummy says you have to come with me' 3 yr olds would believe that.
@1994JBuckton Don't want to point the finger, she's probably going thro hell. Just don't get why police think he couldve left on his own...
Did his mum not lock the door? How could he have got out? Strange. Hoping he's found safe.
Worried about Mikaeel Kular. Surely he must've been taken by someone he knows. No signs of break-in n 3 yr olds can't leave on their own.

I don't like Loose Women, but I like Carol McGiffin.

Dexter and Gina are trending but the winner isn't. Says it all. #BBUK
Sorry Sam, @GlynWise remains the best ever Welsh housemate.
@thebeanboy23 I quite like Rylan but he needs someone more experienced and professional with him to do the serious stuff.
#BBUK imo an ENTERTAINING housemate should win. Otherwise why bother watching all summer?
@matthewpparker I bet he can't see what's real &amp; what's just bb hype and nonsense atm but he will eventually. Take care of yourself. xx
#BBUK Judging by the crowd it seems that Sam is going to win. He's been anonymous all summer, what has he done to deserve to win £100,000??
@matthewpparker So sorry Matt. You supported him so much while he was in there, I always thought it was really sweet. Hope you're ok. x
@VirtualAstro Much too wet and cloudy to see anything here tonight. :(
#ILoveMyCountry So bad it's good? ... or just 'so bad'? #cringe
#BBUK Sophie deserved to go. I don't think the show will be any different without her. She didn't contribute anything.
#BBUK So what if Ch is still 'finding' herself? She lost much of her adult life to an eating disorder. Well done to her for overcoming it.
#BBUK I really can't believe I used to like Gina. She's is horrible. Why can't others see that?
#BBUK Gina needs to have her eyes opened. Her life is sorted because she's never had to work for anything. Not everyone has it so easy.
#BBUK I have really gone off Gina recently. She is not very tolerant of others and thinks that her opinion is the only one that matters.
Sorry for tweeting so much about big brother recently. Getting a bit obsessed with it!
#BBUK Oh I wonder who will go on Friday?? Hmm let me think... #Hazel
#BBUK Sam talks a lot of sense imo.
#BBUK I like the twins' diary room chats, it's when they're funniest. :-)
#BBUK Hazel's face when Charlie spoke to her! So cold and hateful. What a truly awful woman.
#BBUK Hazel's in her own little world if she thinks she's done nothing wrong. Charlie's friend said what many people outside are thinking.
#BBUK Hazel is lucky that her career doesn't rely on people liking her personality.
@StatsAndHeartBB Maybe, I don't think Charlie's done anything wrong and G &amp; H getting at her for what her friend said will not look good.
Gina has dented her popularity tonight I reckon. Hazel also sealed her fate for Friday. #BBUK
@StatsAndHeartBB Yh Hazel not coming across well tonight. Gina also. #BBUK
#TeamGareth #Garethftw #BBUK
Why is H angry about what C said? She said it to her face on last nights show so it can't be a surprise and it's not two faced. #BBUK
I feel sorry for Charlie. She's getting it in the neck because of what her friend said. Not Charlies fault. #BBUK
To do this justice it will have to take up a good portion of the show tomorrow. #BBUK
@LadyVenomWay Haha Gareth will have a busy night/tomorrow.
@StatsAndHeartBB Yeah! I can't cope lol
@S_harron That's what I thought too. They're all going to need to speak to him now!
Gareth is in demand tonight. #WhoisGareth #BBUK
This argument is gonna be a nightmare for the editors. I can't keep up. #BBUK
I'd like to speak to Gareth too. This live feed is stressful #BBUK
I bet @bbuk are still kicking themselves for the twist which led to @DanNealOfficial being evicted. The show just isn't as good now :( #bbuk
@AJOdudu Is that for doing so much voting on @bbuk?
@bbuk She looks lovely, but I can't see any difference.
@WythenshaweHall No problem. We'll be visiting this week during the @wythygames.
@danneal2winbb13 A waste of a great housemate! At least you get to see him now. You did a great job on here. x
I hope @danneal2winbb13 stays in BB tonight. He's more fun than Sophie and Sam. It'd be a huge loss to the show if he was evicted. #savedan
