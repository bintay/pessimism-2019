The truth will set you free
So why do they get mad
When I just say what I see
Why don't we speak our minds 
We live in a time 
Where the truth is controversial 
And we'd rather be blind
Who are you 
You don't even know 
Soul searching is like
Trying to find 
A cotton ball 
In the snow
Living a lie
Hiding behind a facade 
Substituting who you really are 
For who you'd rather be 
But all you care about 
Is what they see.
I could expose so many people yo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
