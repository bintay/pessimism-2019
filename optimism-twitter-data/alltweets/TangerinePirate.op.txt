@AkkiAkkiNoMi Nami finally broke free from the girl's grasp, crossing her arms and trying to cover up her chest. "W-What was all that for?!"
@ScarredMugiwara I can promise things wouldn't be going so easy for you! Now, let's get going before I change my mind!"
@ScarredMugiwara Nami let out another sigh before adding, "Don't make me regret this! You're just lucky that it's your birthday, otherwise -
@ScarredMugiwara our treasure! You're on your own for everything else!"
@ScarredMugiwara "Woah, woah. I never said I was here to be your babysitter. I'm just coming along to make sure that nothing happens to -
@ScarredMugiwara "Do I really have a choice? If I just let you go and do whatever you want, who knows what sort of trouble you'll cause!"
@Optimistic_Gon "Trust me, people /always/ owe me for something. But like I said, I'll let that slide for now, so try and enjoy it!"
@Optimistic_Gon "Happy birthday! Since it's your birthday I'll wait to discuss your outstanding balance another time." She said with a wink.
@ScarredMugiwara that answer! Something tells me I should probably go with you."
@ScarredMugiwara "Wait just a second!" Nami exclaimed, reaching forward and grabbing Luffy by the back of his vest. "I don't think I like -
@AkkiAkkiNoMi "E-Eh?!" Nami exclaimed, completely taken aback by the girl's actions.
@KuroAshiPurinsu "Great~! ... Wait, it's Luffy's birthday?" Nami said, pausing for a moment and blinking. "Ah! R-Right! I knew that!"
@ScarredMugiwara Nami instantly shot him a suspicious gaze. "... What do you mean 'drastic'?"
@KuroAshiPurinsu "Well, of course! You see, I'm just so hungry.." Nami said, putting on a sweet smile and folding her hands behind her back.
@AshuraKenshi obnoxious."
@AshuraKenshi "That's...!" Nami paused for a moment, wanting to choose her next words carefully. "At least those arguments are much less -
@RubberyHero // Ah, I do not believe we have before then. At least, I don't recognize your name. It's nice to meet you! I'm Cassie.
@KuroAshiPurinsu "Oh, hello Sanji-kun." She paused for a moment, a slight smile finding its way onto her lips. "I was just looking for you!"
@ScarredMugiwara "Fine, fine... You're still not getting any money, though."
@AshuraKenshi much more enjoyable for the rest of us."
@AshuraKenshi "You know, I'm sure that you could make it through the day without fighting with Sanji for once. And it would make things -
@ScarredMugiwara have to start holding you responsible for the other's debts as well, including the massive one held by your swordsman."
@ScarredMugiwara Nami was once again quick to respond with, "No, Luffy! Besides, if you want to go by that logic, /Captain/, I'll just -
@AshuraKenshi "Good afternoon to you too, Zoro." She responded in a sarcastic tone.
"... Well, it looks like those two are arguing /again/. Not much of a surprise there."
@ScarredMugiwara food budget for a reason. If you want more meat, maybe you should work on getting some money of your own."

@ScarredMugiwara Nami lowered her eyes. "Why do you want to know that, Luffy?"
// What are some good, active One Piece RP accounts to follow? :O
@GomuGomuPirate "Eh?" Nami blinked and let out a small sigh before looking up and spotting the rubber man. "What is it this time, Luffy?"
@KenshiNoZoro dry land. With your sense of direction, you'd be out there forever!"
@KenshiNoZoro attempting to snatch the sake away from it. "At least if I went overboard, I would know which way to swim to get back to -
@KenshiNoZoro "Ha, ha. Very funny, Zoro. Like I haven't heard that one from you before." Nami responded in a sarcastic tone before -
@RubberyHero // Not that I know of, at least? xD Who is your Writer?

@KenshiNoZoro Nami simply rolled her eyes at the swordsman's response before placing a hand on her hip. "I won't hold my breath then."
@KenshiNoZoro "You know, you could at least pretend to be nice for once."

for this! You can't just mess with my stuff!" @KaisokuGariZoro @ChivalrousCook @GomuGomuPirate
Nami snatched @KaisokuGariZoro as well, attempting to hold both of them back. "Someone is going to pay - @ChivalrousCook @GomuGomuPirate
"Hey, if I didn't look after our money, can you imagine what would happen to it? Especially if Luffy was in charge of it..." @UsoppsFables
of money if we play our cards right...!" And with that, Nami let go and spun around. "Gon! Come here!" @GomuGomuPirate @Optimistic_Gon
toward her and whispering to him, "Look, just listen to what this guy has to say, okay? We could get a lot - @GomuGomuPirate @Optimistic_Gon
Nami didn't even flinch. She was used to @GomuGomuPirate's actions by now. She grabbed Luffy's ear, pulling it down - @Optimistic_Gon
"Oh, hey Luffy!" @MonkeyDluffyg
Nami ignored his mumbling, glancing around for the deck for her Captain. "Hey! @GomuGomuPirate! Where are you?!" @Optimistic_Gon
ask again... Zoro, do you know what happened here?" @ChivalrousCook @GomuGomuPirate @KaisokuGariZoro
Before he has a chance to escape, Nami grabbed @ChivalrousCook by the collar and pulled him back. "I'll - @GomuGomuPirate @KaisokuGariZoro
"Awe, come on! I'm not /that/ scary, right?!" Nami said, letting go of @UsoppsFables and frowning.
"Just remember, anywhere or anything that I am even slightly mentioned in, I better get my money... I am always watching." @UsoppsFables
Nami stuck her tongue out at him. "Don't get into any trouble and we won't have any problems." @Optimistic_Gon
before speaking once more, "Okay... who was it really?" @GomuGomuPirate @ChivalrousCook @KaisokuGariZoro
Nami lowered her gaze, turning back to @ChivalrousCook and @KaisokuGariZoro. She snatched her panties away from Zoro - @GomuGomuPirate
"You know I'm going to expect royalties from that, /right/?" Nami said, putting her arm around @UsoppsFables's shoulder.
"I don't know just... don't get into any trouble, okay? Or I'll charge you 300% over!" @Optimistic_Gon
Nami's anger flared as she turned to her innocent-faced Captain. "Was this YOUR idea?!" @ChivalrousCook @GomuGomuPirate @KaisokuGariZoro
"Yeah, yeah. That works. He should be around here somewhere..." Nami said, tapping her chin as she walked off. @Optimistic_Gon
"Come on, Usopp... You aren't actually afraid of Brook, are you? What would he even do?" @UsoppsFables
"You're wearing my bra, how could you POSSIBLY explain that?!" KaisokuGariZoro @ChivalrousCook @GomuGomuPirate

Once the item was in view, her eyes instantly lit up. She threw her arms around the giant ruby, rubbing her face against - @GomuGomuPirate
and forth, squinting all the while. She finally caught sight of something shiny, instantly rushing over toward the item. - @GomuGomuPirate
Nami decided to ignore @GomuGomuPirate's weird actions for now in order to run back down the dark path from before. Her eyes darted back -

"Quit screwing around and help me get this chest open!" Nami huffed, looking to the chest and then back to @GomuGomuPirate.

// Guys. I am dying right now. Also I will reply ASAP; training the new girl so I can't be on Twitter much. @DesertLaSpada @BlackSwordYoru
"Are you an idiot?" Nami pauses. "Whatever. As long as we agree on that, you can eat whatever weird food you find, Luffy."

@GomuGomuPirate
"Let's just find Sanji and Robin! We wouldn't want someone else to swoop in and steal MY treasure, after all!" @GomuGomuPirate
Nami looked at Luffy, opening her mouth to speak but quickly closing it. She finally replied with, "Don't worry about it. - @GomuGomuPirate
Nami watched him for a moment before finally shaking her head. "...... I-It's nothing. Let's just find Sanji and Robin." @GomuGomuPirate

with some intelligence around too." @GomuGomuPirate
"More hands, more treasure?" Nami doesn't hesitate and quickly replies with, "Yes. It will be nice to have someone else - @GomuGomuPirate
"Sanji-kun?" Nami shrugs. "I guess that works... Where is he anyways?" 

@GomuGomuPirate
from here, right? Should we bring anyone else along?" Nami asked, tilting her head as she looked to @GomuGomuPirate for his answer.
"Well, I couldn't just let you go alone... who knows what might be left behind! You said it was in a cave not too far -

@GomuGomuPirate
to be worth a lot!" Nami's eyes sparkle at the thought. @GomuGomuPirate
"Gem stones?! Are we talking rubies? Emeralds? D-Diamonds? You know what, it doesn't matter. Anything like that is bound - @GomuGomuPirate
"There might be treasure or there is treasure?! That's very important, you know!"

@GomuGomuPirate
Nami listens carefully to @GomuGomuPirate however she does not hear the one word she was waiting for. "And treasure... /right/?"
Nami sighs. "That's not the point! But, whatever... Did you need me for something?" @GomuGomuPirate
"You didn't even look, did you?! What if I had really been in trouble or something?" @GomuGomuPirate
"What are you talking about, Luffy? I've been here the whole time! Are you sure that you were /really/ searching?" @GomuGomuPirate
"Hm... I wonder where everyone is..."
(OOC: I will start actually roleplaying with all of you tomorrow. Because for now I need to get some sleep, haha. Night!)
"I only like money and tangerines!"
