Seriously so many young people have died these past couple of years. What the fuck is going on?
Omg dude I say this all the fucking time &amp; no one takes me seriously  
That's seriously so fucking sad, it puts all your problems into perspective. If you're healthy &amp; have your family you have everything.
Honestly I didn't know the guy that passed away but I'm praying for his family, that's so sad. Cancer is truly Satans creation.

I'm really curious to see what Bruce's new name will be!
The suicides, the murder, the discrimination, its all so wrong. They're just trying to live their lives in a way that makes them happy.
This interview is making me cry! OMG

@Jake_Gnarly we'll he says he has had a "women's" soul all his life, so he's getting surgery to take him from a man to a woman
@Jake_Gnarly Bruce Jenner??? Lol
Actually not weird... Different. But go Bruce for opening up &amp; telling his story
Just bc I think changing from one gender to another is "weird" doesn't mean they don't deserve to be treated like human beings.
