<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>I'm a little let down, but I'm not dead<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
No way can't believe I didn't know about something so big
To think that Dan made the website for Serena and for 5-6 years he continued it. It was essentially a love letter for her.

A Nebraska woman is suing every gay person on Earth and asking a federal judge to rule on whether homosexuality is a sin.
Can't believe how stupid people can be
Omg @joseyunderscore season 6 is crazy

I hate when people lie
I should listen to @Ile_del97 that way I'm not in a complete bitch mood tomorrow
@Ile_del97 make me :-P
O well hopefully Amy will like them :-P
They bought the most random birthday balloons
Omg my mom and her boyfriend have no taste

Reading the last book of the PLL series :-D
If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story -Orson Welles
@_ha_lee_a_nee_ I know :-(
@_ha_lee_a_nee_ very minimal amount of sadness I felt sad for the mom, maid, and neighbor lady
@_ha_lee_a_nee_ I laughed at the outcome of their relationship Tate deserved it
@_ha_lee_a_nee_ @Natalie14551292 to get out of this conversation
@_ha_lee_a_nee_ @Natalie14551292 the day when summer ended and we stopped seeing each other everyday

He really blows me away
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and
I'm goin' crazy
About him lately
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing
Think I'm really falling for his smile
Get butterflies when he says my name
Smooth-talking
So rockin'
He's got everything that I'm wantin'
She sent Rumple away
Omg Belle
If not... Buy them as a gift and get someâ¦
Omg Higgins is the best and I hate putting pressure on her and she's so sweet
Took me two pages just for cloning
