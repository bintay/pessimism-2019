Yes people being racist hinders some opportunities. Same with sexist people. There are still ways to shit on them nonetheless.
Remember when you used to talk shit about that fat person? 5 years later he a fitness training and you look stupid.

See, why nobody got their hands up? See, that's the issue."
Same with women being discriminated against. You show that you can earn get a better education and get further &amp; men won't say a word.
But after getting your asswhooped, you really can't say anything. Can you?
When I played against white people and I'd talk. Of course they'd be like "oh nigger this nigger that"
I've noticed, and I'll use my time playing video games as an example.
@Partynextdoorr yea but I was always better than those niggas so they either usually get quiet or leave the games
In my opinion, the best way to even thwart discrimination is to just shit on the opposition's existence entirely. Become the master.
Racism is never gonna end. Just as discrimination against sex, and religion will not.
If I had a dollar for every time I've been called a "nigger" on XboxLive I would seriously be on the Forbe's List.

And I realized how meaningless it is to dabble with such small affairs.
I also realized that this is what separates the peasants from a king.
And they'll never confront the people about anything but will complain endlessly about them.
And they'll openly hate that person you're cool with and you just don't know why.
You can laugh and joke with somebody and then listen to someone else talk shit and complain about that same person.
It's weird though, being cool with everybody on a moderate level is so stressful.
And I usually never have a problem with anybody unless they have a problem with me or something im doing.
You notice that people just complain/talk shit about each other behind each other's backs.
Maaaan, working with different people, I've learned one thing that makes them all the same.

But yall gon keep cock swallowing the media...
Then Yall wonder why People like Kylie Jenner are famous when yall dick ride everything she does.
It's a big unnecessary shit storm.
But you say that and then automatically black women on Twitter will bash you and say you hate the race and blah blah blah and all of this.
I personally do not give a fuck about make-up, lip sizes, hairstyles and clothing.
And a lot of it is the women, it's sad to say but it's true. <CONFUSED FACE>
So fucking annoying man.
I'm all for black empowerment and I'm all for pushing the appreciation for our culture but my god, Yall bite every time Yall get a stare.
People will put shit on the Internet and OMG Yall gotta throw Yall opinion into the mix.
A lot of Yall spend so much time being inside of the lives of these people who don't even know who you are.
"Omg she got dreads, she wants to be black."

Really?
"Omg she got implants, she wants to be black"

Nigga
You niggas hold "bronzed make-up and bigger lips" to the same level as police brutality. My god is it that deep?
I swear everyday YAll feel like somebody is doing something to "mock" black people.
Kylie Jenner didn't make big lips a trend. No one is making fun of black people. You motherfuckers need to get off of the internet.
Everything always has to be about race to you people.
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em.
