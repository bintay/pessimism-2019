@AmericasBelleXO sorry I didn't clarify, my bad. And I'm trying to speak for that 1%
@AmericasBelleXO yeah she is too young I agree there 100% but things happen.. There's crazy situations where abortion is right..
Cats &gt; Humans 
I need to get off Twitter for today before I make myself even more mad. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@Queen_of_prep what I'm saying is that rape is wrong and to force a woman/girl to have the child that was a product of rape is wrong too.
@g_dedes @AmericasBelleXO exactly!!!
If you make fun of people who wear Lilly from target I'll make fun of you for being such a rich snob. You need to get over yourself. <RAISED HAND>üèΩ<UNAMUSED FACE>
@Queen_of_prep how is it irrelevant?
One of the biggest attractions is our two story outhouse <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>  
@g_dedes @AmericasBelleXO I agree 100% they should be showing what teen mothers go through instead of how to put a condom on.
@Queen_of_prep my choice isn't just chosen because of rape but it's a factor and who says I don't?
@Queen_of_prep um what?
Don't get me wrong, I think abortion is wrong and immoral but there's instances where it's a better choice than having the baby.
@AmericasBelleXO have the worst luck sometimes. You're being very closed minded about this topic.
@AmericasBelleXO so you're saying sex is only for making babies? Look at what age you live in.. Mistakes happen. The most cautious people
@AmericasBelleXO I'm talking about being raped hon. There's a difference
I actually love cardio but this is so funny <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@AmericasBelleXO has the baby, in some cases it's the best choice.. In not saying it's moral bc it's not but you have to think..
@AmericasBelleXO could have saved both? Or what if he woman can't support her and a child and will ruin both hers and the babies life if she
@AmericasBelleXO and what if those girls are too young to carry and have that baby and they'd be risking their lives, so ruin two when you
@AmericasBelleXO how about the women and teenagers who get raped by men twice their age? Are they supposed to still have that child?
Some girls will go crazy just to get a guy. Jesus.. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><GRIMACING FACE><FLUSHED FACE>

@His_Foreverrr @xo_sarcasm well you said you hate alcohol so.. Once you're mature and realize alcohol isn't for getting shit faced its okay.

I would never be able to live with one of those small hippy dogs that bark and where when you pick them up you can feel all their bones <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@Minnestoner420 I HATE those people. Like if you didn't listen to him when songs like Lost in Translation and Marilyn came out then shut up.
