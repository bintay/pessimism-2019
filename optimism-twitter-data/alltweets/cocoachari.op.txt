Trying not to think about the family I lost again.
My lover is the reason why I giggle when reading a text.
Spending time with the in laws before they become in laws.
Lord give me strength just lost another relative.
First happy to annoyed to happy and optimistic now sadden.
What a roller coaster of an emotional day.
Place your bets.
Bake sale, beach, fight...Easy day
Today was a good day.
My body is saying that I need a vacation. However, my calendar says I don't have time.
Last night was definitely one for the books...Outspoken.
I will be preforming. 
He said "just because" 
Wish we could always be close to one another.
Missing my loves already.
Back to work in 30 minutes
Barbecuing with the family. . Great food. Good times.
The annoyance is real.
Some women just don't know how to behave as women.

Issues on overload.
Or is it that or that they truly reveal who they really are?
Death always seem to bring out the worst in some family members.
Another limb of our family tree has broken off...R.I.P. Grandma #heartbroken
It's my Birthday.
Step one of the transformation. ..34 and loving it.
I'm not feeling 100%
I always try to see the positive side of things, but some things I just can't.
I am annoyed by disrespectful people.
Whatever!
The Judas that kissed my cheek. Smh
Why bother help you when you refused to help me?
Why should I help you after you betrayed me?
I love who I have become.
Every year, February through March is the most challenging for me..#Lent
My spirit guide said "you have something for the world. Do not be confined to the least because there is something greater for you."
I give thanks to God for revealing His glory.
I shall resurrect from this and they will know then that I am blessed beyond measure.
Like Judas to Jesus. They denied even knowing me.
Ne with my baby, see my grandma, and now spending time with my bestie and God-child.
Out with the girls early
Leftovers are better. #Applebees
Now if only I had breakfast in bed and lunch on call....hhhmmmmm
My first day off in months. Gotta do this more often.
@AJ_Ventura No one is better at doing you, than you. #Godbless#yourgift


On my mini vacation
The devil is busy trying to destroy families.
All that energy could have gone into something positive for yourself.
It's sad to see the limits people would go through just to see you fall.
The experience was worthwhile. This is the beginning of a beautiful family.
When we lose one blessing, another one is often most unexpectedly given in its place.
Let the countdown to see my loves begin...6 days.
We sow the seed _ God produces the harvest.
I am a little pencil in the hand of writing God who is sending a love letter to the world. Mother Teresa
This trip was worth it.
Today is truly a beautiful day.
Travel this a.m. took and nap and now ready to shop.
God is good.
The blessing must be huge.
Just when I thought I was having a moody day my baby call to let me know his day is even worse than mines.

Overwhelmed
You have to have patience and passion to deal with the children of this generation.
God is looking for ordinary people empowered by him to do extraordinary things.
Today has proven my potential to do great things.
I love the random "I love you" texts.
Today is a new day to do something different.
You ever woke up and just started writing whatever that is in your mind? It's happening to me right now.
The journey is as important as the destination.
Happy Sunday everyone.
Wooooo! Almost lost it...
I realized that I really don't like him...I can't stand the sight of his toad ass, ungrateful dirty m*Ã—% s.
Wedding planning full time
I have vented enough. Shall we proceed to grow
This chick will let me pop off in 2...let me keep my cool

The sacrifices we make just to have a better future
It's too early. .No! I need more sleep.

Pulled an all nigher. Then got up early to be back at it again..I need to catch some zzz
I don't know how to feel about last night. ...
The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord.
Good morning!
Still feeling horrible. .popping pills and drinking plenty liquids
Sick in bed since yesterday.

Witnessing the union of two lovers makes me feel a kind of way...

It's true when they say, mother nature responds to us.
I have a feeling I should be somewhere else right now.
Another day to give thanks.
Grading papers...
Enjoying "This Christmas" #bet
I am a success story.
The children are too much to handle...
I am tired.
Some people have real nerve.
Some people never appreciate the little you do for them. But the minute you stop, you become their worst enemy.
He's making plans for our future.
Sometimes I think screaming is the only solution.
Today my best friend, counselor, and partner in love is setting out to lay the foundation for our bright future.
Love is seeing more in me than I see in myself.
Working the night shift has its ups and downs...oh well back to work
One hour sleep is never enough.
Last time I checked Jesus was the miracle worker not me...
I am so annoyed right now...
Date night with my love.
I'm hungry and tired.....but I have to work.
What's for dinner?

Weekends are not weekends anymore.
I'm so sleepy............
It's going go be a wonderful weekend. ..because today has started off good.
I can't wait to see "No Good Deed"!!!
When we don't challenge our youth to do greater things then we have failed our children.
Preparing for tomorrow
This morning started off rough but I put my energy into what was positive and my day turned to be great.
I think I will go visit one of my loves...
I love that I inspire....
But he never changed his status for you though...# flips hair &amp; wakes away
So you edit the comment on your picture of your baby daddy after my love posts one of me....# immature
My time is valuable. ..
I hate pointless meetings
You got to be spontaneous to be with me
Trying to find something to do. ..
Every time I wonder how I'm going to get through. ...somehow I do.
Time for a break...
Raising awareness in my class. This is where I belong.
Why are making such a fuss when we are killing each other everyday and no one seems moved by that?
I love teaching in and out of the classroom
What's my name? You can call me Royalty.
Let the benefits roll in
People ask for too much and don't give you enough
I'm not accepting failure
All this good I'm doing better come with a bonus...
Looking past someone's looks and appreciating the way they treat you makes the chance worthwhile.
Now I'm faced with a dilemma. ..follow my heart and follow my mind?
I woke up feeling so much better
This is a test...good morning!
I'm about becoming the best!
On another note. .lunch from Centino-Cruzano was on point.
Location hunting..
This chick is so fake!
This chick said "I'm like an intestine, I make shit happen." Really!
I am not the kind to sit at home all day doing nothing for myself.
I swear I think I ate about 5 ice cream cones...it is hot!
Ouch....
Is it me or Dating Naked makes you feel uncomfortable?
Back in STX
Congratulations Josette! You did it! Love you! #kaplanu
Tortola here I come!
In St. Thomas for the second time this week
Out doing business
Trusting in what is to come takes discipline.
He said "be still and know that I am God."
One door closed now 3 windows on the top floor opens...I will not complain.
Now to discuss the fact that I would be out of reach for at least 5 days a week until settled in. There's a lot to think about.
The perks and crew is promising. ..it's great to be a part of something special.
So I got the job, now I have to figure out if I would move or work can I work remotely.
In St. Thomas and the difference between the two islands is so obvious. .

Staying humble while I see the storm coming
I'm wishing they would play more local artist music on the radio

About to do something productive. ...those 3 hours was hard.
How do people sit at home all day doing nothing?
I'm bored out of mind
At work watching @DavidTutera on Netflix...I aspire to create beautiful memories like him.
Playing Uno with a 4 and 5 year old is amusing
Thanking God for the rain...so that can appreciate the sunshine
Don't feel sorry for yourself

Toothaches are the worst. ...uuuggghhh

Precious times, valuable moments of my life
@ a board meeting
Time for some shut eye.
Mission accomplished!  2 jobs completed.

I'm busy doing me and that's building something you thought can't be done.
I could never understand people who work hard and not smart.
No baby! I just told you the facts about you..thought I didn't know huh?!
That moment when you feed someone's intuition.
Good morning world! Everyday is a blessing.  Thank you God!
It's going to be a good day.
So he could talk to me like I'm the help...dude done fall on his head.
I respect who respect me. Point blank period.
Did this guy just tell me respect my superior?!!! I'm sorry but he's a coworker with a lighter shade skin and bigger check.
Good morning! Change of atmosphere is good for the soul.
Thank for coming. I have been waiting patiently. #love
It is taking everything in me to not blow up with all this tension.
I truly dislike being around fake 2 faced people.
Missing what you took for granted. Live with it.
Oh my ex is here and his face says it all..lmao
All the ladies were beautiful. .and had a great energy.
What is this queen with a crown on seriously threatening to kick somebody ass..Classy with a K
