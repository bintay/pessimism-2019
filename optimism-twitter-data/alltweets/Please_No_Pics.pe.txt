Did she lose a bet? She out here tryna catch someone's eye? She just tryna make a statement? Find out on the next episode of Dragonball Z..
I'm infuriated I'm really just upset at life right now that she just thought that was okay..
My question is, who are her "friends"? Somebody told her she was cute and she took that lie and rode a marathon with it, out here like Lance
Like I'm really upset scratch that, I'm APPALLED that she is a part of the African American race doing the only fuckery disgracing her fam
You gotta be a bond/stupid mf to do some shit like that. She better have like 8 layers of Vaseline on, how doesn't she have frostbite?
