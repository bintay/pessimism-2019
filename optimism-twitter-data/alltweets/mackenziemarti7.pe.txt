Couldn't ask for a better feeling when you finally get to sleep in your own bed after a vacation. #Heaven
I'm the type of person who cares about my friends happiness more than my own.

I love packing, because that means I'm getting the hell out of utah! #ThankGod <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@katie_bodily yeah definitely! That's why I was trying to bring it over before I leave tomorrow..
@katie_bodily I've  tried a couple times, but it makes it hard when you don't have a car and plus when you went to New York, but it's fine!
I have no luck trying to get @katie_bodily her birthday present. I can't have it in my room anymore because I want to have it. #TheStruggle
You may never be good enough for some people, but you will always be the best for those who deserve you.
Never forget who was there for you, when no one else was.
I wish you would want to come visit me anytime your having a bad day.
Not sure if I should get my tattoo next week or not..? #Decisions
Love trying to scroll through my contacts seeing who would want to hang out. #drawingablank
