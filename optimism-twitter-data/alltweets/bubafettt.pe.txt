Finally rid of the migraine...only to learn the freezer in the basement broke sometime between a few days ago and this morning. #FML
Tonight, it's going to be a bottle of wine, me, @kevinpollak...&amp; 60 other comedians #MiseryLovesComedy #HappyMothersDayToMe
I'm sorry, I simply cannot take another delivery of bullshit. You see, I already have a metric ton. You deal with your bullshit, thanks.
Looked at myself in the mirror today&amp; didn't recognize, or like, what I saw. Time for a change. I can't do this anymore.
May the fifth be with you...the fifth of Jose Cuervo...
much like March 18th is the day everyone has the Jameson-flu, tomorrow with be Cuervo's Revenge.
No more phone, no news, no acknowledgement of the world outside these walls. #done
I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to see the bullshit anymore. I want to bury my head &amp; not acknowledge its existence.
From what I have experienced, that is terribly difficult. #GoodnightMoon #ForAWhileIHope #CantTakeAnymore
Here's to dreams much sweeter than reality &amp; sleep as restful as possible. May have to turn my phone off tomorrow. Be nice to one another.
So, off to bed. Where I can wake from even my worst dreams. No such luck here. I can only hope for relief form this horrible bullshit
If you have a flying fuck about me, you would care what I had to say. I need support with my kiddos...but no. Never as important. Ever.
They don't care how hard I have cried tonight. They did not have to feel it. I still hurt. They don't care. I quit. I can't take any more.
So, do I get to decide my "fate", ha. No such luck. I am an emotional dumping ground, and shall not bitch.
So my pity party is to differ by both sides, whom I both love &amp; whom refuse to speak. I. Am. Fucked. No matter what. Wholly, totally fucked.
Now I need to be there for my family, when I was asking for support. I do not know what to do, so I say yes. Because I'm suppsed to?
I literally cannot speak to anyone in my family &amp; Chris just doesn't get it. So I'm left with wine. Not the best answer, but all I have.
Not sure what is worse than this, but I'm afraid if I express it, it will become my reality. Not ready for that.
Unfortunately, I know life gets worse than this. I just have yet to experience it, but I can see it coming. So now I wait...
Ho. Ly. Shit. I was right. It got worse. Much worse.  Goodnight.
If I do not close my eyes and go to bed now, my day will only get much, much worse. I am so fucking tired of crying today.
Exactly 2 years ago today! via @timehop  
I almost wish I would have never gone to CA. I'm not entirely sure the aftermath is worth it.
I truly, deeply hate feeling this fucking hopeless.
All I wanted was an hour to myself...just an hour where I wasn't being asked anything of anyone. Just something for myself. But no...
@_troyjohnson hello there. @jettila suggested I ask for dinner recommendation in San Diego. Our last night here, would love your input. TYIA
@aishatyler thanks for joining me on my vacation 
@Bourdain @PartsUnknownCNN the videography on S. Korea is just sublime. Living every minute of the story. So, so cool.
@aishatyler @Bourdain I didn't enjoy the podcast, I FUCKING LOVED IT. Listen to it all the time.
1st vacation since having both kiddos. Excited to sit on the beach with 2 of my fav authors @Bourdain @aishatyler 
Sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine &amp; some popcorn watching the Zumba DVDs I purchased. #LifStrong
@GuyFieri @RioVegas @williebosshog @DucksMusical Fuck @DucksMusical &amp; all their hate filled &amp; bigoted bullshit.
that feeling when you really want to call someone &amp; tell them how much they mean to you...squashing that because it is never well received.
Trying my hand at gardening with wine bottles. #WinoGardening #Recycle 
@danharmon I could &amp; would watch the telepresence robot fight on an endless loop. Need that laugh. Hysterical. #CommunityLivesOn
Perhaps the mentors on #AllStarAcademy should teach their mentees to not taste with a spoon, then put it right back into food you're serving
ZOMG! @eddieizzard &amp; @thomaslennon on #Alabama. Incredible. So much joy. How was this not made? It's my happy place.
Everything I needed to know about sucking shrimp heads I learned from @Bourdain

Thank goodness for @fivehundy posting that YouTube clip with the MASSIVE DILDO.
To quote Pete Campbell: "Shit". #MadMen
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE MOUSTACHE! I JUST CAN'T. I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT. #MadMen
I envy Joan...so very, very much...
Ho. Ly. 1970s Batman... #moustache
Is that all there is? #MadMen
Excited for this to start tonight!!! #MadMen #Pandora 
My happly place right now is watching @pennjillette on @PartsUnknownCNN with @Bourdain . I'd kill to be in Vegas right now...
All I can say is thank goodness @danharmon is back at the helm of @community_tv . Brilliant.
So very thrilled for our best friend &amp; his new baby girl, but holding that lil peanut affirmed I am done having babies.
Today is March 32nd &amp; I have a taser...up to you to decide I'm I'm joking. #DoYouFeelLucky
WE ARE CANCELING 
Indiana Summer of 69 tour 5/16.
I WILL PLAY @IndianaUniv this Weds and donate my…
Watch a roast of Justin Bieber or have multiple root canals simultaneously without anesthetic...I'll take the 2nd option.
@dslifton I can still do math I have tips, so clearly I'm fine...ON TO THE NEXT BAR!
@dslifton I can only imagine you're the only person I can ask what this hangover is gonna look like.
In hindsight, mixing whiskey &amp; tequila is probably a very bad choice...as well as the reggae...
I JUST HEARD CHURROS WITH A CARAMEL BACON SAUCE!!!!! SOLD!!!!
@HuffingtonPost i am ashamed to be from Colorado right now...
@HuffPostTaste @HuffPostFood I DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO TWERK, I JUST WANT A GODDAMN DRINK!!!
#IndianaFail
One of the most powerful things I have heard is "always look for a way to turn your liability into an asset". Thank you, @altonbrown .
#TBT both times I got to see &amp; meet @nerdist . Awesome guy who has been an awesome source of positivity in my life 
@jettila @SimonMajumdar depends on which one of you two started the house fire... <GRINNING FACE>
literally about to curl up in a ball and cry. I seriously cannot take anymore.
How to determine your stripper name; just use the awful memory &amp; handwriting of the tow truck driver. #MelodyMonterey
One small victory? One? Please? No? Fine.
Now our peers from HS are contacting me for advice on how to prepare foods...should I lose my effing mind and go for it?
We were voted most likely to be "on Food Channel", despite it being called @FoodNetwork ... 
My goodness, this version is gorgeous #Pandora #StPatrick'sDay 
I feel like hell. So I'm going to sit in bed with some hot tea &amp; FINALLY watch @KevinSpacey in "Beyond the Sea". #SpaceyIsTheBestMedicine
Still haven't seen this movie. Given how much I worship Kevin Spacey, I seriously need to remedy that. #Pandora 
Also, @ChopTedAllen is my spirit animal. <GRINNING FACE> #AdoreThisMan
I just love that #AllStarAcademy is working with home cooks. Makes me feel like maybe, just maybe, I could stand a chance.
If give my left arm to be part of @chefsymon , @garnaschelli , @curtis_stone or @bflay 's team. First, I need the courage.
@chefsymon even on my worst day, hearing my kiddos laugh &amp;/or your laugh automatically makes it 100% better.
Sausage Eater, You've Lost That Lovin' Sausage, I Can't Go For Sausage, Did It In A Sausage #ReplaceASongTitleWithSausage #SausageAndOates
I adore watching @BadAstronomer on @pennjillette &amp; @MrTeller #Bullshit. He is beyond brilliant. #AmazingAstronomer
@TheTuscanGun got rave reviews! 
@RelUnrelated easiest $100K he probably ever made. That is awesome.
@TheTuscanGun @debimazar getting a little applewood smoke on our Porchetta before finishing it in the oven. 
@altonbrown everyone has a drawer just for kombu, Katsuobushi &amp; dried Shiitake mushrooms, right? They should. 
@altonbrown why do people say "marscapone" when it's spelled "mascarpone"? Drives me nuts.
Has been a rough frew months here. A huge TY to @Bourdain , @KevinSpacey , @thomaslennon &amp; @MatthewPerry for getting me thru it. #grateful
Been a rough evening. My efforts not always appreciated by the kiddos. Perhap someday. Otherwise, good night.
*Chris &amp; I listening to "Lately by Tyrese"* Chris: Lately, have I asked if you want a butterscotch dilly bar? BACK OFF BITCHES, HE'S MINE!
@KevinSpacey please tell me Frank Underwood will take a call from a bananphone...Raffi said he would... #DesperateMom
I'd like to thank @Bourdain , @pennjillette &amp; @MrTeller for the comfort they have brought me lately. #SickAndSickOfIt
About to hit my breaking point...I swear, I am going to explode in either tears, expletives, pain meds or all of there above.
While I am happy you have found meaning in a pyramid scheme, I do not want to incessantly hear about said pyramid scheme... #DamnitFacebook
Thursday cannot get here soon enough.
@SimonMajumdar and you just made my evening, sir! Thank you so very, very much. <GRINNING FACE>
I seriously cannot get enough @SimonMajumdar . Absolutely adore this man &amp; insanely jealous of his trip thru Japan.
No I don't want cookies/popcorn/discount cards/raffle tickets. I just want to buy my freaking bread &amp; not be asked to buy more. #kthxbye
Oooooookayyyyyy...S3E3 guys a little close to home given today's events...
NO NETFLIX! I WON'T WAIT 30 SECONDS FOR THE NEXT EPISODE! I WANT MORE HOUSE OF CARDS NOW!!! #TWITCHING
@KevinSpacey I really missed your face. Love seeing you in @HouseofCards again. #AllNighter
Yep...well, looks like it is going to be a House of Cards bender... #ZOMG
@ZamirGotta @Bourdain @PartsUnknownCNN I am so very sorry Zamir. Terribly unfortunate. I remember him very fondly with you &amp; @Bourdain
Any direct contact regarding House of Cards season 3 spoliers will be delt with swiftly &amp; painfully. #NotKidding #WillMakeFrankLookTame
@Bourdain didn't you &amp; @ZamirGotta have dinner with this gentleman on @PartsUnknownCNN ? #RIP 
@fivehundy @dslifton also, I know exactly what "we'll see" means...say it every damn day
@fivehundy @dslifton LOL. I would rather watch this than Mayweather vs Pacquiao. I know...I'm not helping.
@dslifton @fivehundy oh, this HAS to happen now.
@fivehundy is there any way the "reggae event" could maybe, possibly be live on Ustream? :) :)
Thank goodness Frank Underwood is back tomorrow...he'll tell that damn dress what color it is.
Has anyone asked the llamas what color the dress is?
T-minus 18 hours until there is a country song about #DressGate &amp; the great llama stampede...
wait, I'm confused...someone put a black &amp; blue dress on a white &amp; gold llama? Everyone knows dresses are for alpacas. Llamas prefer jumpers
@guarnaschelli @gzchef @ChopTedAllen my 3 yr old told me "the asparagus was great, but the salmon had too much lemon." I am probably Chopped
The kiddos are cleaning up tinkertoys...together...without me asking. I like this parallel universe.
@NerdistMom adopted both these guys. Murphy &amp; Seamus. 
It just HAS to be some conspiracy with appliance manufacturers that their products take a dive right around tax refund season...
@fivehundy and my mom said it too...not enough silkwood showers...ever
was gonna use @fivehundy Amazon page to order some dong quai (because I want to win on the podcast), but my mom told me she had some...ewww
Well, that was not the news I wanted to hear. Starting to become a theme with the Dr office.
But Damnit, I love me some Rick Ashley. #RickRolledMyself
Dear sweet zeus, Chris is playing every song we ever heard on every Jock Jamz album ever made...send something at least 90 proof...
Ugh...damnit. Now the "ironic live-tweeting of the Oscars" is just as irritating as the Oscars. #YayForNetflix
This hurts. A lot. I just want it to stop. Please.
Let me be. I've tried it all. It has failed. I'm failing to, but I'm not curled up in pain. I give. I'm wrong. I'm doing my best. It sucks.
One day, I'll be able to happily change a diaper without pain. And I'll remember that for the rest of my life. Just let me be. For fuck sake
It isn't right. It isn't healthy. Neither am I. But Damnit, I'm trying. I'm fucking trying. This sucks. So. Fucking. Hard.
Yes, it might affect me or make me loopy. So fucking what. I'm not in pain for once. Let. It. Fucking. Be. Please.
I'm far from perfect, so yes...sometimes I have a glass of wine to feel fucking normal. What I feel is not normal. I want normal, Damnit.
@thomaslennon I miss Figgs Housecat... (sp)?
@MarylandMudflap are you available to babysit?
Every time I turn on Food Network, Guy Fieri is yelling. Apparently peroxide bleach &amp; donkey sauce cause hearing loss. #TheMoreYouKnow ~*
"Damnit, Seamus! Stop eating the guacamole &amp; get off the damn table!" Not the first time I've said that, either...
Seamus has been worried about me...so much so, he has no problem violating personal space 
Holy cats! @NerdistMom followed me! That just made my day. Thank you! @nerdist your mom is awesome! Explains where you get it.
sometimes, life sucks. Hard. And when it does't suck for us, we need to be there for the people who were there for us when it sucked.
I don't believe in higher powers, but I do believe that I was kept awake for a reason. I hope it was a fraction of the decency given to me
Seems to be one of those nights that I will not sleep, despite the pain meds... #CruelCruelWorld
I can't help but feel that saying something nice to a celebrity/stranger on social media is not the worst thing you could do. Desperate, yes
@YNB I absolutely love seeing your face on my TV again! I adore you!
I know it's silly to get excited about any celebrity RT or Fav, but sometimes it is a bright spot in your otherwise frustrating day #thatsok
@thomaslennon adored the premier! Made for a wonderful end to a frustrating day. You bring me more joy than you know. Thank you!
I quit. I give. White flag. No more. I'm done.
@thomaslennon what do we need to do to make sure #Figgs is a permanent @latelateshow fixture?
I just want to fucking cry right now. Suppose I should get to celebrate National Drink Wine day.
Pull up to Dr office, Dr is leaving to deliver baby. No one can see me or wrote Rx for pain till Monday. #FML
FOR LENT I'M GIVING UP GOING TO BABY SHOWERS! #ProblemSolved
so help me Zeus, if there are games...I'm out.
another baby shower...and I'm supposed to bring a book...and diapers...AND A GIFT?!? Jeezers...maybe I do want more surgery. #unbelievable
Damnit...I can't take anymore...
Had to show the hubby @thomaslennon from last night's @latelateshow ...especially after the damn Canadian beagle won. #AdoreThisMan
@eddieizzard just got my tickets. Look forward to seeing you in Denver in May!!! #Thrilled
@thomaslennon you, sir, did an excellent job last night! Would love to see you do more of this!
I am so fucking sick of crying myself to sleep because I'm in pain. Seriously...Chris pays good money for insurance so we can be well...WTF
That feeling when you learn surgery didn't solve the problem...
It is one of those nights where it is just easier to feed the kids dinner while they're naked for more reason than I can possibly list
@dslifton @goglazed *drool*
I'm sore from cooking for 11 hours. Not sure if I should cry, go to bed or have some wine...or just cry in bed with wine. #NightyNight
@gzchef not perfect, but damn proud for my first ever time making any kind of souffle. Awesome recipe! Thank you! 
Thank you @GordonRamsay &amp; @jettila . Dinner was a hit! 
@jettila @GordonRamsay @gzchef I have a very happy family tonight!!! Thanks everyone!!!
Making @GordonRamsay 's salmon nicoise with @jettila 's duck fat potatoes for dinner, @gzchef 's chocolate souffle for dessert #WishMeLuck
I'm listening to Summer Wind by Frank Sinatra on #Pandora 
Congrats to the family member who inspired me to leave Facebook for a while...
There is a local guy by the name of Sevan Stryker selling Kias. I'm sorry to hear about your (assumed) failed porn career.
Decided I will be making @GordonRamsay 's salmon salad niçoise for dinner for Valentine's Day...because it is incredible.
@Nick_Offerman bummed no CO dates. Good excuse to ask the hubby to go to Vegas, though. Adore you guys.

Oh, Shit! 23 cities x 3 genitals=

@hm_custserv I won't give H&amp;M gift cards until the company is more in line with how other retailers honor their gift cards.
@hm_custserv I was told all items I was interested in are online only. With only 1 location, my shopping is limited with only gift cards
@hm_custserv which do not carry or even make available the products I actually want to purchase. It is very odd &amp; massively frustrating.
It is one of those days where I wake up to see all my work undone &amp; wonder why I even try some days.
@hm I am baffled at how hard it is to spend gift cards with you.  Won't be asking for them ever again.
Am I the only person who thinks chocolate covered strawberries are over-rated?
The hubby is using Bruce Hornsby to explain to the boy why he may not have a lollipop right now. #ThatsJustTheWayItIs
@jettila just discovered Jet Fuel on YouTube. LOVE. IT!!!!
I find myself, one again, being comforted by @Bourdain after illness &amp; surgery. He never, ever fails me.
That feeling when you're crying becuse it hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse, so you try to stop &amp; wait for the pain meds to kick in...
@JosephTeti you also just made a little boy happy when I told him you liked the picture. Thank you so much!
@JosephTeti my hubby &amp; boy love watching you. Made this out of our very old Christmas tree. @DualSurvival 
Feel like I'm drowning. Would kill for some time to actually recover. Not in the cards for me, I suppose. Gotta pick up the slack #exhausted
Would ya look at the time. It's "pudding &amp; Percocet o'clock" #NightyNight
Here goes nothin'
4 of the 5 reasons I'm done have kids are next door screeching while on a trampoline, 1 of them in nothing but a diaper...in 50° weather.
Attn CSPD; I am not driving under the influence of anything, I am just trying to avoid the potholes.
@TMobile 2 things I won't do: Fund terrorists &amp; fund Kardashians. #NotPayingForIt
Kayne must have gotten McCartney the tickets.
@dslifton how goes pork-a-palooza?
Of course the ONE time I want to write "duck fat", my phone autocorrects it to "fuck fat".
@nerdist Happy 5 Year Podcast Anniversary! It has been so much fun to get to know you, @jonahray &amp; @MattMira!
Ladies &amp; gentlemen, I do believe I have received a wrong number text!! Let the games begin. #LoveThese
Puppy Bowl referee, huh? Well, whatever gets you your SAG card...
entirely too much death in my life this week...
Holy cats. @altonbrown 's Turbo Hummus is no joke.
I know it sounds like lunacy, but I might actually prefer this version. Absolutely wonderful. #Pandora 
Maybe, some days, this world isn't such a mean, nasty, cruel &amp; selfish place after all. Nice to get to bed with faith in humanity restored.
I feel that my time spent in post-op recovery will be best spent re-reading(listening) to @nerdist way. Want to get back on track.
@altonbrown approximately how much bourbon was consumed during last night's #CutthroatKitchen? Because it was amazing! #Crewdiddy
In other news, the gray &amp; neon Pro Bowl is boring the daylights out of me...
On the spectrum of "things I give a fuck about", anything to do with 'Belichick' and 'balls' can't even motivate a single fuck given
@altonbrown Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra?
@altonbrown I live at "high altitude" &amp; would love to know of any equation to help adjust leavening for successful baking way up here. Thx!
Holy cats, @Bravotv Best New Restaurant is awesome. Exactly like @GordonRamsay's on BBC, and with @tomcolicchio!!! Perfection!
Before you invest in a bird that repeats everything it hears, come talk to my 3 year old. Might change your mind.
Hey @Bourdain ...If there was any thorazine left, I think @chefludo needed it for the finale.
Congrats to all the chefs on tonight's @TheTasteABC finale! Especially Gabe &amp; @MarcusCooks !!!!! Amazing. Boulder will be proud!
Gah....Damnit. Wanted @Bourdain to go to Grand Finale soooo bad. #NextTime #TheTaste
@MarcusCooks absolutely LOVING your coat and bowtie on tonight's @TheTasteABC !
I would probably honestly, literally, truly pass out if I had to cook for Jonathan Waxman...
Chris: the turkey is beeping. What should I do?
Me: did you try asking it nicely to stop?
all I want is for the kids to feel better...I also want to get hopped up on cold meds &amp; watch @bourdain win @TheTasteABC...&amp; feel better
This cold sucks. Benjamin finally feeling better, but now Madi and I have it. Feel Like my head is in a fishbowl.
@CSSD11 had a lot of stuck cars &amp; very close calls near Rudy today. Should have delayed. Was VERY dangerous this morning.
Curious where the hell the snow plows are this morning...
Chris pays Comcast WAYYYYYY to much money to let anyone make me feel guilty about not watching SOTU.
My poor kiddos aren't feeling well &amp; I am running on little more than desperation &amp; coffee. Think a family post-lunch nap is in order
@altonbrown you should be sainted. Sourdough, coastal cheddar &amp; 2% American. Absolutely divine. #NobelPrizeForAlton 
@RelUnrelated still have no clue how to explain it without hurting innocence.
@RelUnrelated given where we live, I'm not that surprised. Just hate when kids are the collateral damage.
@RelUnrelated apparently my atheist chicken mac &amp; cheese &amp; my atheist swing set were ok when it benefitted them. Such is life
I swear the only reason I am barely, marginally interested in football is because of @ChrisWarcraft
For the record, my being a Red Sox fan in no way requires I care about the Pats...or football. Seriously...no fucks are given.
@RelUnrelated *made them food...damn phone
@RelUnrelated I mean, I made them good, watched their kids while they moved in, etc...but NOW it's a problem. Feel bad for my poor boy.
@RelUnrelated Glad to hear it! Our new neighbors are very religious &amp; won't let their kids play with ours because I'm atheist...
@RelUnrelated despicable...and not entirely surprising. I'm so sorry.
Listening to Phil Simms in Spanish is my own personal hell
I can safely say I'd rather listen to Phil Simms that the warbling happening during the National Anthem...oh look, I get what I asked for...
Decided to call it a day...was accidentally backed into while walking to my car. Luckily, I was just a bump. But I'm done...so...done...
What do I do when I feel like a rotting sack of hell? Apparently I watch @altonbrown &amp; feel better...&amp; hungry for the 1st time in a week.
Try to relax on the sofa &amp; now being forced to watch Red Dawn...cruel &amp; unusual.
Really bummed I can't see @nerdist next weekend. Glad I saved the $ to help pay for the damn surgery, though. #PityParty #SilverLining
Hack My Life is hilarious.
HALP! This movie is abysmal. Save me from this subpar "acting" and please just load me with enough tequila to forget I ever saw this...
If I ever check-in from "Flavortown", I have been kidnapped by Guy Fieri &amp; am being held against my will. #SayNoToDonkeySauce
My father is driving 1/3 cross-country. I call to see if he arrived safely...get yelled at for interrupting the meet &amp; greet. #IQuit
No...really...I LOOOOOVE cleaning the kitchen 7 damned times today...it's my favorite thing. #ForFuckSake
Lots Of Trouble, Usually Serious #Lotus
I absolutely love that @pattonoswalt narrates for Adam Goldberg. Just makes a great show absolutely perfect.
@nerdist interrupts his own show to point out a double standard of censorship (via @Upworthy) @midnight 
LOL! A comedian interrupts his own show to point out a double standard of censorship (via @Upworthy) @midnight 
If I tried to put a Roomba in my family room right now, with every single toy the kids have everywhere, I'm fairly certain it would explode.
So, finally seeing @nerdist 's stand on nipples. You sir, are a saint. Thank you for your support &amp; logic. #MuchLove #YouRock
What have we learned this morning? Think before you "help". Sometimes you might be making it harder.
Now that the snow has mmelted I get a little more warning before I hit a Buick-sized pothole. #PotholeSeason
Someone writes "I just seen" on my Facebook profile...trying...to...not...let...head...explode.
I can safely say the concept of being under general anesthesia scares the living hell out of me.
Medical reasons requiring I use this pain medication aside, watching Fantasia while on Percocet is either incredible or terrifying.
I'm listening to Here's To The Losers by Frank Sinatra on #Pandora 
Pain killers are *supposed* to make pain go away so you can rest...instead, they make me hallucinate.
Not sure what I expected to hear, but it sure as hell wasn't what I was told. #Vaguebook #BrutalWeek
Definitely did not anticipate hearing "you'll need surgery" today.
"America's Team" didn't win. Fine, was a Bullshit call. Oh well. Cheesepeople, or heads or whatever, win. Moving on.
Given the choice to watch NFL or any of The Bachelor(ette) shows...I would rather do laundry, my taxes &amp; have a cavity filled all at once.
I'm a scale of 1-absolute lunacy...how easy do you think it is to teach a 1 year old to yodel? #SheAlreadyScreamsALot
I have no clue why I get so damn irritated when they play the shortened version of the FitBit commercial. #MaybeLessTvMoreFitbit
@anitamartini happy 10 year podcast-a-versary! Thank you for more than you know.
@fivehundy Just saw this. Happy 10 years &amp; have a blast <GRINNING FACE>
Thoroughly enjoying a red blend called 'Troublemaker'. Seems the wine was made for me by both blend &amp; name.
Uh oh...@bourdain is not a happy camper &amp; I'm afraid Vanessa's head may explode. #TonyVsTonyTasteOff
It is official, @SteveMartinToGo is my spirit animal.
@TheTuscanGun my family LOVED the porchetta!!! Got some awesome b'day gifts. Imagine they'll be better next year if I make it again. Thanks!
Just me, a snowy day, a glass of sauvignon blanc, a porchetta &amp; lots of @altonbrown Good Eats. Happy b'day to me. 
Spending my birthday with a nice snowfall, @TheTuscanGun &amp; @debimazar 's porchetta recipe &amp; new #ExtraVirgin later. 
I think I was just sexually assaulted by a Liquid Plumber TV commercial.
I cannot help but feel like every judge on Chopped said at least 7 "What? The? Actual? Fuck?"s tonight. #InterestingButTerrifying
@MikeDobranski $20 it's leftover Claussen pickle juice too (which works AWESOME for pork, BTW)
@MikeDobranski I will brine pork overnight &amp; corned beef the obligatory 7 days, but poultry longer than a few hours is ludicrous.
@MikeDobranski yikes. Unless you need 600% more sodium that day, total overkill.
@Misnomer yeah...I got nothin.
@Misnomer Maybe if you go out front &amp; sing "Let It Go"...
@Misnomer That is the first American flag I've seen with Christmas decorations...
I've said it before, I'll say it again; Fuck. Cake. Pops. All of them. Always and forever.
So, given the food trends of 2014, I imagine we'll see "free-range bacon wrapped deconstructed cake pops with a sriracha dipping sauce.
This "neighbor" stuff is still relatively new &amp; I just hope to have a decent relationship so the kids can play, if nothing more
Trying to not have preconceived notions, but my experiences with in situations are making me feel certain things...would love to be wrong
Our neighbors have 5 kids &amp; are admittedly very religious...I have 2 kids, am done having kids, &amp; got Cards Against Humanity for my b'day...
Perhaps this will be the year I will find myself, learn to accept myself and be comfortable with myself.
Not sure how I got roped into making my own b'day meal after cooking for the last 6 weeks, but I want it done perfectly.
Whaddya know...@TheTuscanGun &amp; @debimazar #ExtraVirgin is back on my b'day! Porchetta it is! #HappyBirthdayToMe
Guess who just learned that her son is terrified of the Troy Tulowitzki bobble head he was given for Christmas...
I Feel like hell. I would rather be hungover than whatever This is. I'll take solace watching @Bourdain's ep of Archer. #LittleThings
I'm so damn sick...and the nap I took is fucking me over. I. Feel. Like. Hell.
Okay...so I can't be the only person who thinks Vanessa is creeping @Bourdain right the hell out. @TheTasteABC
I have never, ever watched The Bachelor(ette), and seeing promos of a bunch of crying women is only reinforcing my desire to never watch it.
My happiness is watching both @Bourdain &amp; @chefsymon on @TheTasteABC tonight.
The nice thing about a box of wine is no one can bitch about how many "bottles" you've had.
Yes, I have been day drinking. Yes, it is because of my night last night &amp; people who think it is the Earth's 2015th b-day. #WereFucked
I know better than to engage idiots on Twitter, but I'll be damned if it wasn't funny as hell.
@Iameangel Ok. Tell yourself whatever makes you feel better. Oh honey, I am a great person. I am told so very frequently. Good luck.
@Iameangel I hope you find peace or decency or this year. Yikes. Makes me sad for the future. Would never confuse you for a good person.
@Iameangel you poor thing. I have. Many things. I don't spend my time defending someone else's "sarcasm".
@Iameangel And using the word "retarded" makes you a pretty horrible person.
@Iameangel Actually, I am not in college. Quite past it, actually. I feel sorry for you.
@Iameangel Oh dear, you poor thing. Congrats on picking a fight you clearly cannot win &amp; instead use hypocrisy
@Iameangel I'm sorry, I was told this is not an essay by someone far less educated than I.
@Iameangel whom also knows it is not the 2015th birthday of the earth.
@Iameangel given what I see here, I find that highly improbable. No need to kill myself. I'm capable of being a decent human being.
@Iameangel LMFAO...*you...also try the space bar between the comma &amp; following word.
@Iameangel learn to use commas, moron
If you are bitching about your need to remember to write 2015 on your checks, please rsvp to the happy 2015th birthday earth party
@BadAstronomer penny for your thoughts on those wishing the Earth a happy birthday today... #ItHurts
@blyth33s If you have any documentation that you have been educated, you should get your money back.
Let's throw a "birthday" party for the clueless idiots who think today is the Earth/America's birthday to attend &amp; make them disappear
@fivehundy jeezus...
My 1st day of 2015 will be an attempt to re-do my NYE. I'm thinking a nap, some day drinking &amp; go to bed at 8pm. #MyWay #Sinatra
I do feel a little better about myself reading the unmitigated jackassery of people thinking today is the Earth's birthday. Help @neiltyson

I almost wish I had a hangover, then I could just hate myself instead of the people who were horrible humans last night.
Crushed. Wholly destroyed. I hope you entitled assholes who threatened me enjoy your hangovers. You earned em. Where's the Zoloft?
I have never hated humanity more than when they have an assuming need to threaten me for a flashy-baton thing. Never. Again.
Well...this has been a disaster. I should have just paid attention to all the warning signs. Just get here 2015. I'm so fucking tired.
Baby has diaper rash, kiddo has growing pains, daddy has a stomach bug &amp; mommy has to let go of her NYE plans.

I definitely do not get THAT dressed up to shop at Big Lots. Clean yoga pants? Most of the time. Done hair? Ha...never. Ever.
Seems like the perfect time to enjoy some Pfeffernüsse. #Gesundheit
@CraigyFerg gonna miss you. You were always there to keep me company when I was up late with my babies. Can't wait to see what's next!
Craig Ferguson's last show made me cry. I'm gonna miss him. He kept me company many a late night with the kiddos.
Any recommendations of a wine that goes well with thorazine? Also, I would like some thorazine. #Holidays #ItsAJoke
Seems to me a special parking spot is what EVERYONE wants for Christmas...they sure as hell are yelling at each other about them tonight
@jefito kinda gives "do the dew" a whole new meaning
@jefito sponsored by Mountain Dew, apparently
@jefito and whomever is/was about to be the receiving end should be thanking me, given the size of the energy drinks he was buying.
@jefito I'm sure my lovely outfit of sweatpants, Uggs and a dirty sweatshirt took him right out of the mood, anyway
@jefito my hungry toddler trumps his sexy time
In line at Target &amp; guy w/ condoms &amp; energy drinks asks if me can go before me...typical male.
"Is it always this loud in your house?" Me: "Not usually. It got worse when someone showed up &amp; started complaining about how loud it is."
Today seems like a great day to stay home &amp; fight the systematic &amp; tyrannical oppression of pants.
@CraigyFerg @StephenAtHome I could always count on you guys to keep me company when I was up with fussy babies. Gonna miss ya. #NoMoreBabies
Curious that @StephenAtHome &amp; my boy share a birthday...&amp; his last show was on my daughter's 1st birthday. What do I win? #GonnaMissYa

Plumber found something wrong with toilet. Said he could have had it fixed in 5 minutes...which is exactly what I said 5 minutes before him
Plumber found nothing going to sewer. I ask Chris why he didn't start with toilet. Chris says he told him not to... #ShitShow
I did ask the holiday gods to not ask for an appliance as a sacrifice...I had no clue this was the alternative. #ShitShow

@altonbrown making your smoked salmon instead of turkey. Used Jack Daniel's barrel chips. It's amazing.

Awwww, @bflay @guarnaschelli and @chefsymon made me cry during Thanksgiving At Bobby's.
Having a very tough Saturday. Then I watched @Nick_Offerman on @midnight &amp; am feeling better. #AdoreThisMan
I should go to bed now. It goes downhill from here.
I'm not afraid of being missed. I am terrified of what I could.miss.
I don't think @Nick_Offerman realizes just how much I worship him. #AllHailTheOfferman
@altonbrown @altonbrown What is an acceptable time to start drinking on Thanksgiving? #Stressed #Family #ABThxgSOS
It is astounding how a split second can change everything. Then it takes 2 weeks to find out just how much things can/will change.
It is one o those times where I don't know if crying will make me feel better or worse. #IShouldProbablyJustGoToBed
I should probably not be on any form of social media tonight. I don't want to make an ass of myself.
That's the time you must keep on trying

Got this fire pit so I can enjoy my patio with some wine, cheese, &amp; Dino even in chilly weather. And it is so totally worth it. #HappyPlace
Needed this tonight 
Seems like the closest thing I get to a spa day lately is vacuuming while I have a mud mask on my face.
Looks like Fox's Utopia was the steaming pile I shit I knew it was without even having to see it.
I didn't vote, but everyone who did made my husband's employer's stock go up 5%, so yay for job security!
@oupiglet happy birthday! We love you and your awesome sombrero. Wearing that alone would exhaust me. Enjoy your rest!
Feel like hell, for more than a handful of reasons. Have a good evening, all.
Thinking it will be a "breakfast for dinner" kind of night. Except for me. I just want cheese, crackers &amp; a glass of wine.
Same bullshit, different election year.
It's perfectly fine to not feel inspired to vote. It's a broken system.

Not sure what's for dinner, because I'm about to take a nap in front of this fire.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, can replace the sound or smell of a  crackling of a fire. #LittleThings
Why is there not a box on the ballot for each politician that says "put on a sinking ship &amp; send out to sea?"
Re-evaluating my Spiced Cider  White Sangria recipe. There very well may be such a thing as "too much whiskey".
Baby sis decided to make me feel like a fool for thinking I'd gotten her adjusted to the time change...at 5am.
Temps dropping fast...might try to convince the husband we need to get the fireplace going
@fivehundy how can they bag while writing the check? #infuriating
@nerdist this would go perfectly with your notebook #ChewbaccaChristmas 
No "extra hour" of sleep in this house, but the kiddos woke up at their "normal time", so I'll take that as a win. #ToHellWithDST

They are seriously going to ask every Giants player about Bumgarner...wow. #FoxSportsFail
Bumgarner wins baseball &amp; Joe Buck needs new pants. Congrats, Giants. So glad I don't watch football. #FUBuck
YES!!!! Give Joe Buck KC Royals blue balls!!!! #GoRoyals
Welcome back to game 7 of the Bumgarner Boner Fest!
What the hell!? Buck doesn't give Holland credit for the K's, but gets his raging boner back now that he gets to see Bumgarner. #Jackassery
For the record, I have a better World Series ERA than Bumgarner.
Bucks "Bumgarner boner" (say that 3 times) seems to be contagious
Teenage girls at One Direction concerts are more subtle than Joe Buck is about Bumgarner.
I can hear your boner thru the tv, Buck. Go clean yourself up.
@fivehundy this was a piece of shit in the key of what the actual fuck
Whoops...that was not god bless America...
I have seen the gates of hell...&amp; it looks &amp; sounds an awful lot like an overtired 3 year old with a slide whistle.
Benjamin has been narrating our dinner. It was cute for exactly 5 seconds.
Game 7 it is then.
No one says "Live Mas" with less 'give a shit' than Joe Buck.
So, the last time the Royals won a World Series I was 1. Interesting.
Almost needed to be blasted out of bed this morning. Love those flannel sheets.

'Putz' is such an under used word
posting a photo of my cat with a beer koozie on a Las Vegas Facebook group can't possibly be rock bottom, right? Right?
The children have now joined forces &amp; are trying to destroy me. Send help! Or wine. Or both. Probably wine.
"Toddler" must be Latin for 'one who knows all your weaknesses &amp; exactly when &amp; how to exploit them'
Not sure what it is, but it feels like the past 2 weeks just caught up with me. I am wiped.
@fivehundy have an idea: FHBM Mangria koozie! Can freeze to keep Mangria cold &amp; help with hangover the next day!
Put some star anise &amp; orange peel in the coffee maker brew basket. Pretty tasty.
Well, hell...I hope this is the last of the nonsense, if only for a little bit. I just can't take much more.

Damnit...there's his food. And his dish. But no meowing to get me out of bed &amp; feed him. It's the things like this that are crushing.
Goodnight, Harley. Wherever you are, I hope it is infinitely better than here. You deserve it.

Go Air Force. Sink Navy. #AirForceBrat
Days like today I am grateful for my social media friends. They've lifted me up without ever having to ask.
Kinda fucked up my own parents haven't bothered to ask how I'm doing. They found the time to ask me to do shit for them.
I keep going upstairs &amp; expect to see him on his pillow. This. Fucking. Sucks.
Goodbye, Harley.
I know booze isn't the answer, but I'm fucking devastated. I'm going to miss this kitty so damn much. Wine is only helping me, not him.
Sucks being an Air Force brat...I know what missing man formation looks like and I know what it means.
Missing man formation...breaks my heart
@altonbrown are you no longer with @nerdist for your podcast?
Glad today has been a long day.
Kinda digging the "new" eps of @bourdain No Reservations called "Asia Files". Combines all my favs into one show.
To quote @bourdain "Good luck &amp; god bless 'em. In the meantime, get off my lawn."
@ATTDeals HA! Tried that nonsense...couldn't get/make calls, brought our stuff back 4 days later then got charged $700...never again
It has been infuriating that my phone is dropping calls left &amp; right, that's when I can actually make them. Just about done with Verizon...
I wish I was stronger...wine has been my courage today. As much as I hate to say it, I needed it to not feel for a minute.
@offalchris watched your speech at MAD 4. Incredible. So very sorry for your suffering &amp; thank you for saying what others won't &amp; haven't.
I hope Harley isn't staying around for us. If he's hurting &amp; tired, he can go. He's done more for me than I deserved.
I hope that I will eventually be able to believe we are doing the right thing for Harley. It's making me sick to my stomach rich now.
Can't sleep. Just laying here with Harley...taking in every moment I can.
And please don't wait for me, kitty. If it is your time, find peace. Do not let me stop you. I owe you at least that much.
Thank you, kitty. For more than I deserved. I'm going to miss you so much, it already hurts. 
He helped Chris thru his mom's death. He was there for our engagement/wedding/both kids...
Why? Because he has saved me from myself more times than I can count. &amp; he's earned it. I'm going go miss him &amp; I can't fucking stop crying
And we will celebrate. He will eat salmon. He will sleep wherever &amp; swing out back. He will ride on heated minivan seats...
It isn't fucking fair. I love this little guy &amp; am going to miss him so damn much.
He isn't just a cat...he has given us more than we could ever give him. He has been there for our entire life together...
There are days I wish I was not aware of mortality...my own or anyone else's. I am fucking crushed right now.
I don't sleep much, but when I have, my cat has been right there on my head. I don't know how I'm going to sleep again. #Crushed
Part of my world has shattered. Part of my heart is broken. I don't know how I'm going to do this.
I'm not ready to say goodbye
This is turning into the worst Monday I have had in a very long time. My poor kitty...
Was loving this rainstorm...until we lost power...
Damnit, Sunday...why you gotta hit me with this.
This Is Life on CNN is fascinating.
When will CNN start airing @Bourdain "International Wedding Crasher"?
I have just come to the realization most of my "mommy time" features wine &amp; @Bourdain...&amp; I am perfectly fine with this. #happiness

For as much as I love autumn, I passionately hate cinnamon scented pinecones. #AssaultOnMyOlfactoryNerve
Benjamin was playing with the Nest &amp; suddenly I sounded like my father. #DontTouchTheThermostat
If you go to bed at 9, waking up at 630 is almost like sleeping in...almost.
I need to get the entire soundtrack to the first season of The Goldbergs
Pretty good haul from JBF. And now that all the tags have been removed I have a pile of laundry. #WhyDoesNewClothingAlwaysTurnIntoLaundry
Checked in at Cheyenne Mountain Resort Colorado Springs 
Oh good...the boy has expanded his list of items he is boycotting to include clothing. Saves me laundry, I suppose. #threenager
one way to tell that your 9 month old is  done playing with you: she hits you across the face with a cable remote
Madilynne like to climb...on everything. The stairs, sofa, fireplace, her brother...might just get her a cat tower.
Love this show #TheGoldbergs #tvtag 
Just got today's #TheGoldbergs sticker. Get yours in the next 2h:29m. #tvtag 
I should've known better. Feel like an ass. Onward, hopefully with minimal further damage.
Perhaps a break is in order. Have a good night, all.
just finished a Runtastic walking of 1.27 mi in 27m 39s with #Runtastic Windows Phone app: 
This JBF sale is no joke. Glad I got here early &amp; had my stuff organized. Can't imagine what people who brought Uhauls are selling.

Date night  (Checked in at Cool River Cafe Denver) 
My dear, sweet, darling children...you win. I give.  Now, can we all get some rest?
What?! Why would a cleaning robot have an option to make a mess?! That's asking for drama! DAMNIT, TEAM UMIZOOMI! #INeedANap
Only thing I don't like about autumn...allergies. Currently knocking all of us on our asses.
I believe the ladybug is having a growth spurt, given she is eating more food than kiddo &amp; napping like a log under a ton of bricks.
If the Art of War was written today, there would have be a chapter on "distracting you enemies with sausage samples"... and it would work
I fear for humanity after seeing what a cheese sample does to people at Costco.
I just made it rain...diced carrots all over baby sis' highchair tray. She will make them rain all over the hardwood floor.
I know only a few will understand this: the boy just took all my consignment tags &amp; mixed them up...
ATTN Macaroni Grill: you are an "unlimited (something)" away from being Olive Garden...so enough with the Baby Got Back/pizza commercial.
Kiddo up at 530 &amp; baby sis gets some shots today...maybe I can line up nap time for everyone, myself included.
Yessssssss... #Cutthroat kitchen time is #MommyTime  Thank you @altonbrown!!!!

No touch flush toilet, huh Kohler? Tell me how the hell that works with a toddler. As if potty training wasn't hard enough.
@ChrisWarcraft also called "I doesn't want to wash any more damn dishes"
I suppose it will be leftovers for dinner...or fish tacos...or both...where's the wine? #MommyIsExhausted
@ChrisWarcraft but why is all the rum gone?
If I was secretly fed Olive Garden &amp; liked it, I would probably have to end it all right there. #FuckUrBreadsticks
After serious consideration, I decided to not throw out all the dirty clothing &amp; dishes...although it would probably have been easier.
Blade Runner is on....so, I guess my plans have been made for me.

@TheJohnDiMaggio I can't get over I Know That Voice. Had my childhood rush back to me &amp; got to share some amazing characters with my boy. TY
Tried a GF lasagna with home-made marinara AND ricotta (couldn't make the polenta...so sue me). Pretty tasty.
@TheJohnDiMaggio I Know That Voice is wonderful &amp; amazing! Thank you!  #EdAsnerWithASwitchblade
Today is definitely Monday in disguise. #GiveItARest #FullMoonJackassery
I have no clue how to feel about what Janay Rice said regarding Ray's punishment. No words.
Another rainy day here. Looking forward to laying low &amp; maybe showing kiddo a new movie. And laundry...because there's always laundry.
Anyone else planning to see #IKnowThatVoice? Join me on #tvtag 
That was the first time kids asked me to buy them booze...at a Dairy Queen. #KidsTheseDays #Amateurs
Hey, Rice &amp; Goodell; my 3yo says you shouldn't hurt people. And if you hurt someone, you tell them you're sorry. Also, don't lie.
Last time I watched the Broncos with the husband, it was not going so well. On that note, I'm going to watch some @bourdain &amp; paint my nails
The fact there is an audience for #Utopia means there can never be an actual utopia. @ThanksFox #Fox Fail
Who the hell wears a bustier to a football game?!?!? #SNF
I do not need to watch the show to know that Utopia is going to be absolutely vile. Judgmental? You betcha. Fox's programming begs for it.
@eve_orona aww. Fox exploits all the evils of humanity for a tv show &amp; you're better than me. Awesome. Enjoy that. Was clearly made for you.
@eve_orona no. Never. Could not be paid to watch that horseshit. I preer this thing called "good tv"
#Utopia looks like an awful, abysmal, exploitative, obnoxious, contrived, &amp; pathetic excuse for a television show. #FoxFail
Damnit... #JoeBuck #RuiningMyLife #ShutUpShutUpShutUp

Did I seriously just see a commercial with a farting blueberry?
Madilynne lets me know she is awake not by crying, but by head-butting her crib.
This being a grownup nonsense is hard sometimes.
@fivehundy unless everyone gets a hand-drawn nude portrait &amp; the bride is floating on a door (that would have fit the groom too), I call bs
@fivehundy LMAO, really?! So, 2/3 of the wedding guests die after the reception is crashed by a massive ice sculpture?
@fivehundy don't take too much time. You're going to need to be ready for the next trend...like decorating with flatware from the Titanic
Got an email that milk bottles are the new mason jars. 1) No. 2) Stop it. 3) A hoarder somewhere is about to be a zillionaire.

Fairly underwhelmed with Barilla gluten free pasta in a macaroni &amp; cheese application.
History channel has a show titled "Hillbilly: The Real Story", hosted by Billy Ray Cyrus. Just soak that in for a moment...
@ChrisWarcraft but it's totally off the chain with donkey sauce, dawg
Curious what makes people I never hung out with in high school think I would want to hang out now, on the grounds we both have kids. #nope
Who has 2 thumbs &amp; got a chardonnay grape vine for $3? #
I hear Guinness is good for you, gives you strength &amp; that you should drink it when you're tired. Sounds like a good cold medicine for me.
Feels like I swallowed barbed wire. #OfCourseImSickOnAMonday
I quit. I give. I will not try any longer. I don't have it in me. Taken enough beatings. No more. I'm done. It's over.
I figure if I drink enough coffee, I will be able to travel forward thru time, past the part where I get sick.
Too tired to sleep.
Closing in on being awake (for truth's sake, let's call it conscious) for 40 hours. Nighty night, folks.

@fivehundy lovely.

There seems to be a direct relationship with the time of the morning I get up &amp; the amount of nonsense that comes at me.
Breakfast for dinner. Actually, pancakes with pecans &amp; pumpkin butter. Have I mentioned I'm ready for fall?
Been watching the clock &amp; my phone for 4.5 hours. Can't help but feel like more time passing with no word is not good.
I have nothing nice to say, so as the rule goes...nothing more will be said. Have a lovely day, folks.

Had a hot air balloon come right over the top of our house &amp; swore it was going to land in our neighbor's backyard.
I declare that September will be "You Don't Need To Be Aware of Everything" awareness month.
Already planning my Thanksgiving menu...and it does not revolve around turkey.
It's one of those days where every time I finish something on my to-do list, I wind up adding 5 more things. Still need to scale Mt. Laundry
I will be honest with people I trust. I would not dare attempt honesty with a person exhibiting this behavior. Makes me very nervous.

Once you have kids, just stop looking for money in the sofa cushions. You won't find any because you don't have any.
You wanna come at my party with this nonsense, weather? I have a patio cover &amp; portable fire pit. %rain <FOGGY><UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS><FIRE><CLINKING BEER MUGS><DANCER>
My backyard smells like I filled the Jack Daniel's distillery with pork, then set the place on fire. I LOVE IT! <FIRE><PIG FACE><FORK AND KNIFE>
The husband asked me to find a tie to match his outfit, since he is meeting the CEO today. I picked a tie &amp; made him change his outfit.
I suppose this pork shoulder isn't going to smoke itself. And if it does, I might need to see about some medication.

Blown away to hear "more than words" by Extreme in the grocery store. Thought there was some law stating it is only allowed on mix-tapes.
Ah, yes...the "I learned how to sit up on my own so I simply cannot sleep anymore because this is too much fun" stage...I remember you well
anthropomorphic dogs with dentures is still unnerving. Lederhosen strudel boy with the dead eyes &amp; creepy smile is a close second.

I dunno...I've learned to enjoy &amp; even look forward to time on my own. Strange to feel like I need to defend it.
Sometimes I just need "me" time. Me, my tree lit up by lanterns, crickets, &amp; a glass of wine. And that should be ok

Attn jackass; I like listening to you weed-eat your ENTIRE GODDAMN LAWN about as much as I enjoyed your shitty music earlier. #STFU
I just used #Shazam to discover Sunrise by Simply Red. 
I just used #Shazam to discover La Charreada (The Charreada) by Linda Ronstadt. 
I just used #Shazam to discover For The Love Of You (Part 1 &amp; 2) by The Isley Brothers. 
I just used #Shazam to discover Good Times (Acoustic Version) by Tommy Lee. 

I just used #Shazam to discover Miss You by The Rolling Stones. 
I just used #Shazam to discover Zou Bisou Bisou (Scotch + Sofa Remix by IAMX) by Jessica Paré. 
Well...this shrimp boil ain't gonna make itself. #Murica
Happy 4th everyone.
Thoroughly enjoying all the @bourdain on Travel Channel today.
First taste of sangria &amp; it isn't bad. Fruity, but not getting the herbs &amp; spices just yet. Excited to see what a night in the fridge does.
The 3 year old just told me he wants to go to Vegas...perhaps I've been saying that out loud a lot...frequently. #parenting
Ohmygee... @davidchang is a genius #MisoCorn 
@anitamartini @fivehundy I cannot wait for this! Fav part of the VT review had to be "culinary question mark".
Checked in at First &amp; Main Farmer's Market 
Going to bed now, as it appears we're in for another long night.
Great...looks like I'm not making Belgian waffles for dinner after all.
Checked in at Aquarius Tanning Salon &amp; High Tech Spa 
Guess it's back to chopping wood...
To those boycotting Belgian chocolate, beer, &amp; waffles today, send all of that my way &amp; I'll gladly take care of them for you.
Curious how many new religions were created overnight.
We may soon need to see our physicians to get recommendations on which companies beliefs will support our healthcare needs.
I fear we are on the cusp of corporations filing lawsuits to support legal discrimination based on every fathomable belief.
Long night full of pain &amp; a restless 3 year old. Gonna keep off the book of faces, especially after yesterday. Play nice, folks.
Much needed chiro visit today. The rest of my evening shall be spent with an ice pack.
"People need to take responsibility for their actions" is an actual argument used in opposition to birth control. #HeadDesk
Boy, it sure is a good thing that female employees of Hobby Lobby will have Planned Parenthood to go to for affordable contraceptives.
Already planning my Victory Rolls and Bettie Page dress for next weekend.

Headed back to our high school alma mater to watch my uncle play softball. Been 12 years...wow...
Shout out to @altonbrown for going to Woolworth's in La Junta!!
Hello, ice pack. I'd like you to meet my lower back. #ouch #IFeelOld #GetOffMyLawn
Trying to get outside chores done early since it is supposed to be a scoarching as the Vegas strip today...I'd much rather be in Vegas...
Words cannot express how happy I am to be in bed at 7:30 #LameAndDontCare
I am exhausted from supervising arboreal removal...time for the misters.
Love this cartoon. #RabbidsInvasion #tvtag 
Murphy's Law #638,553,983 - the chainsaw will stop working when you have one. Damn. Tree. Left.
Sitting in the back yard while baby sis bounces &amp; kiddo rides his tricycle around in his underpants. #SaturdayMorning
A fitness studio next to a BBQ joint and liquor store...that's just mean.
Checked in at Aquarius Tanning Salon &amp; High Tech Spa 
Always nice to see a passive-aggressive act of self-pity disguised as decency.
The most heartbreaking sound I've heard to date is the cry of a teething infant. #BreakingMyHeart
*grumble grumble grumble* up since 1 *grumble grumble* coffee *grumble grumble*
6 month growth spurt = less sleep &amp; much, much more coffee
On a scale from "0 to CSP", where does "taping your child to his bed so he stays there" fall?
Was today "International 3 year olds making questionable decisions" day? Pretty sure kiddo broke or set records. Always falls on a Monday...
And the child just blew his train whistle while on the potty to signal he is done and needs help...
Great to know I have so many people in my life who enjoy poking me with a stick...both literally &amp; metaphorically.
Not sure who told Chris I enjoy (or even do) yard work, because they are both sorely mistaken.
I really should've had the Lumberjack Song playing on a loop for today's events.
Fairly certain Chris is on the verge of teaching kiddo how to "Bet Max" on MyVegas for our tablet so kiddo can rack up points for him.
Excited I get to see my dad today for father's day. Grateful he's ok spending it helping us chop down trees/build trellis/etc.
GAHHHHHH! Who wants to babysit?  RT @vimfp Four months till your vimfp afterglow.
@dwalsh76 totally get it. Tour is fantastic &amp; my aunt does a great job. Hope you enjoy your time in CO!
@dwalsh76 gotcha. If you want a tour of Coors Field, let me know. Perhaps next time. Have a blast...and some pepcid
@dwalsh76 and my bro is a graduate of CU
@dwalsh76 may god have mercy on your indigestion. My aunt works for Coors Field. I'm in Colorado Springs, but have lots of family I Denver
@dwalsh76 you're in CO?! Enjoy Boulder! Let me know if you find yourself any further south.
@dslifton just grateful Benjamin doesn't introduce himself that way...yet
@dslifton and how bad is it I have a matching onesie for baby sis?
@dslifton 
I have an immediate investment opportunity for anyone who might be interested...
How is it I've never made a diaper bag friendly drink mixing/serving set? I could be a billionaire...I'll send a few bucks @dslifton's way.
@dslifton can't hate on corkscrewed weaponry, seeing as I'm someone who has a wine opener in her diaper bag. Both are just so damn practical

Me: kiddo, you want some more oranges?
Kiddo: no...I don't like the orange ones. I like the white ones. 

One or both of us is overtired.
Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but it is also kinda pretty damn creepy.
Boy, that went off the rails pretty quickly. Go home Tuesday, you're drunk.
So...guy pulls a hamstring &amp; gets carted off on a stretcher? Ummmm, wha? #SoccerDrama
There is substantial cruelty to waking up and realizing the world had to keep spinning when someone else world came to a stop.
Death sucks. Hard.
Why does perspective always show up at the 11th hour?
Tough weekend ends on a brutal, devastating note for people I care about. Hug the people you can &amp; tell those you can't that you love them.
Welcome to my world 
I'm as free as a breeze &amp; I'll do as I please...just bummin' around 
Also, I find it hilarious when I'm called a "bitch". Speaks volumes about the one saying it &amp; yes, yes I am.
If there is a silver lining to the jackassery of the past 24 hours it will have to be much less negativity in my life, if only for a bit
Given how my day started (and how the last 24 hours have gone), I'd like to think I can only go up...but I've seen that train wreck before
Experienced the unbelievable &amp; disappointing side of humanity today, many times over. Discouraged doesn't even begin to describe it.
If I were to describe what it is like being a homeowner in 3 words: Broken. Sprinkler. System.
Checked in at Wimberger's Old World Bakery &amp; Deli 
It may be easier to ask forgiveness over permission, but the thing is you'll only be given the opportunity to ask for it once.
@fivehundy that has to taste like Cinnabon vodka and Nyquil...
Only downside to folding laundry on the patio is it makes no sense to turn on the misters since everything just came out of the dryer.
Ok...maybe one more episode...
Frank Underwood, you magnificent &amp; despicable bastard
Wow...this episode is...intense...
Time for 1 (ok, maybe 2...or 3) episodes of House of Cards.
@fivehundy look what I found to make French toast to go with our brunchy punch! #LetsJustHaveVodkaAndToast 
The weather decided to match how I feel today. #yucky
How have I never seen Chef Bayless on Iron Chef?!?!?!?
Trying to do a workout at home with a 6 month old &amp; 3 year old is like trying to stop a tornado using applesauce...
Made some pretty spiffy crafty type thingies today...curious how they'll look tonight.
Brutal day. I'd "throw in the towel", but that would require I do that load of laundry.
Oh look, here comes the Monday truck to deliver pallets of cases of the "Mondays"...I swear, I did not order this nonsense.
Nothing screams 'Monday' quite like both kiddos screaming at 5am. #IRefuseToTakeDeliveryOfThisCaseOfMondays

If the toddler meltdowns continue in this fashion, I will need something much more whiskey-ish in my coffee.
Today's to-do list has been cancelled because the weather is just not conducive to my being anything resembling productive.
I summon the powers of the dirty chai!!! #caffeine  (Checked in at Starbucks) 
Looking at my monster of a to-do list today and it is evident I will need so. Much. Coffee. #AllTheCoffee

Couldn't find my trusty Olive Garden-isssued wine opener, so I had to use my backup...that I keep in the diaper bag, incase of emergency.
Almost every car in the liquor store parking lot has at least 1 parent &amp; 1 child waiting in the car. #parenting #wine
@CJMonta livin la Vida loca...while choosing a lasagna. #olé
Fairly certain King Sooper's Mexican Fiesta theme is about as racist as you can get while grocery shopping. #olé
Chief among the many reasons I don't go to the movies anymore; outbreak of "dystopian" theme, can't afford it &amp; literally have no time.
How can I turn my hatred of &amp; lazy approach to cake pops into the next craze "cake balls"? #SouthParkDidIt
The good news is this tub of cake balls (that will NEVER be cake pops) go great with coffee.
Frank Underwood is a diabolical, conniving, brilliant asshole
@fivehundy has Steve from parabounce been invited to VIMFP? He was kinda the first casualty, wasn't he?
Some days the best "mommy time" is just cruising the van &amp; listening to @altonbrown
If hell exists, it is would be having to make Disney movie themed cake pops for a childs birthday every day.
Whenever someone makes cake pops, the terrorists win. #Regoddamndiculous
Cleanup on aisle floor #BreakfastWithToddlers
Damn dishwasher fairy didn't show up last night.
I know better. I have kids, for crying out loud. I should know better. Any time I enjoy has its polarity. Which is why now is happening.
Parts Unknown in Thailand was absolutely brilliant.
Ok, so not quite 7:00 for me. I think I'll go upstairs, ignore some laundry &amp; watch some Tony Bourdain.
Oh look...it's "beer &amp; misters on the patio" o'clock
@fivehundy you're a terrible parent for not posting pics of your tumor baby all over social media
Boy, @fivehundy talking about surgery takes me back to my C-section. #SoGladHesDoingWell
@fivehundy you gave me this awesome podcast to make my already awesome night stellar. Least I can do.
@fivehundy I promised, though. I swear, I will make it happen. I feel awful.
Damnit...I am so happy right now.
Also, I am a HUGE SCHMUCK for not having sent @fivehundy his cookies yet. #ImSoSorry #KidsISwear

Even Benjamin knows he's on thin ice. When I told him it's nap time, he said it was a good idea.
Battle lines have already been drawn...and I didn't even engage. Sucks to feel defeated by 8 am.
Watching @RiverMonstersUK is like watching me with my 3 year old every. Damn. Day. Sometimes there's even water &amp; fishing line...
The words "don't throw a DVD at the cat" actually passed my lips tonight...
Benjamin...my sweet boy...I know you can make better choices...but it seems you have no problem spending the next 15 years in time out.
Congrats to the USAFA graduating class of 2014
Benjamin has made some unfortunate decisions lately. What really sucks is I have to enforce the consequences &amp; it almost always affects me.
I know I'm not feeling well when coffee doesn't sound good.
Well....looks like I'm gonna be up till 3 am... #HouseOfCards
House of Cards it is!
The Sopranos...or House of Cards
...Sopranos or House of Cards...which show shall I become addicted to &amp; have no time to actually watch...
My life is an episode of "As The Toddler Turns...&amp; Turns &amp; Turns &amp; Then Falls Down &amp; Cries Because He Fell, But It's Funny 5 minutes Later"
Sunrise by Simply Red. 
Paging @fivehundy  RT @Bourdain Brunch is not a “trend”.  It’s a profit center.
Everyone (but me) took their mandated nap &amp; seem to be feeling better. Now some fresh air &amp; sunshine seems to be doing wonders.
Ok...I was on board with the mid-season finale of Mad Men...until the end. Not sure where the hell that came from...
I am about to initiate mandatory naptime.
The house reeks of Cepacol &amp; coffee. #SickDay

Found my high school yearbooks...I look like the kind of teenager that drives me crazy these days.
It's a funny place in life when you get stoked about new appliances. I mean, 29 cubic feet with a freezer drawer!!!
Murphy' Law #749,673: items being delivered/installed will arrive at the EXACT MINUTE the baby goes down for a nap.
If for no other reason, you should buy @TheTuscanGun &amp; @debimazar 's #ExtraVirgin cookbook for this #porchetta 
Back from Lowe's where @cjmonta dropped some coin on paint &amp; a new fridge #yolo
@TheTuscanGun @debimazar update on #Porchetta: keeps getting better. Roasted bone next to it to help flavor basting 
Workshopping a "ginger &amp; grilled lemon sangria" idea...
Everyone should be jealous of how amazing my house smells right now. Nothing Yankee makes can hold a candle (haha) to this. #Porchetta
@TheTuscanGun @debimazar who needs candles when you have Porchetta! #SmellsIncredible  #ExtraVirgin 
What is it about holidays and appliances taking a dump? Luckily, holiday weekends seem to mean sales on appliances.
Hey, mother nature...you unrelenting bitch. I JUST got the baby to sleep &amp; ya gotta hit me with dime sized hail?
Tickle squeals 
My attempt at being a neo-Luddite lasted less than half a day. Amazing what I'll abandon to find things to make the kiddos feel better
Guess there is nowhere to go today but up. #NeoLudditeForADay
The bad news; both kiddos are restless &amp; crying. The "good news"; we have a lot of DVR to keep us company tonight.
I love it when I wake up &amp; watch something so funny it makes me laugh hard enough to spit out my coffee.
I'll drink to that #HowBeerSavedTheWorld #tvtag 
OF COURSE we have hail moving in...I just planted things in the garden. #Damnit

@CJMonta can we fix it?
@Mluna197476Luna @TheTuscanGun @debimazar it is stunning. Worth every penny. Easy to cook from, too.
All it took was @debimazar &amp; @TheTuscanGun's Carbonara to turn this Monday around. #ExtraVirgin

Got me there.

A huge thank you to those who celebrated kiddo's birthday with us today. Hard to believe he'll be 3 very soon. In other news, I'M EXHAUSTED
My #ExtraVirgin cookbook by @debimazar &amp; @TheTuscanGun may have inspired me to make my own Mother's Day meal. #porchetta

On today's ep if Facebook Faceplam, humor &amp; sarcasm is met with nonlinear one-upsmanship.
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS SWIPE THE DEBIT/CREDIT CARD ON THE WRONG SIDE IN COMMERCIALS?!?!? IT DRIVES ME INSANE!
All I needed was cat food, but the person in front of me apparently needed to do a corporate merger in the express lane...with a check
I believe I see a few MAFFS flying around today...almost that season, isn't it?
Ho. Ly. Shit. A 254 pound FISH?!?!?!?
It's" mommy time", which means it's @RiverMonstersUK time. #ObsessedWithThisShow
High of 81 today? Good thing I tested the misters &amp; they're working beautifully.
@CJMonta call me back, damnit!
Kiddo quote of the day: "You're not a princess anymore. You turned into a mommy." #dethroned
She did it. She slept &amp; put herself back to sleep. And I knew she could. I thought I wouldn't make it. One more step in the right direction.
I will take whatever minor victories I can get right now because they usually translate into sleep...and we could all use it.
Just as the dryer finished the laundry, the prunes I fed baby sis kicked in. #CruelAndUnusual
Baby sis is sleeping on her own. As hard as this has been, it seems we will all be getting the sleep we need in the near future.
Sleep training still sucks...
Got to see exactly 13 minutes of Frozen today.
Feels like I'm watching a car fall apart in slow motion on a direct route to a devastating accident...&amp; I've tried to fix &amp; stop it.

There's a store close by called 'GUNS'. Tempted to go in &amp; ask how much tickets are for the show. #INeedToBeSocialized
Any day I feel like I've been less than stellar mom, I tell myself "at least I'm not like Betty Draper/Francis"

I don't know much about soccer, but I do know enough to know you don't want to score goals for the other team.
Well, I suppose now that Chris is getting Lasik, I should probably start waking up &amp; doing my hair &amp; makeup.
It's pretty alarming how polarized children's toys are.
Went with cool bubble wand thingys to make huge bubbles. Toddler tested &amp; approved.
Shopping for a little girl's 3rd birthday gift...I'm screwed.
10 *game* suspension for Pineda? That's it? So, he misses 2 starts. That'll teach him... *facepalm*
@fivehundy yay!!!
Uehara, you magnificent beast. Red Sox win. Pineta is a dumbass. Goodnight.
It's almost like the liquor store owner saw the bags under my eyes &amp; the magnum bottle of red wine in my hand &amp; instantly knew I have kids.
@anitamartini right there with ya. Cheers!
Trying to watch the Yankees @ Red Sox while a totally naked almost 3 year old runs amok...also, Michael Pineda...seriously, jackass?

@fivehundy maybe get rid of all your clean underwear?
@fivehundy damn...
@fivehundy it's all about proximity...leave the house &amp; go far enough away where you can't get back in time.
@fivehundy this shitshow is turning into a shitshow.
@fivehundy You should have gotten these: 
@fivehundy I haven't been this interested in a #shitshow since that Amy's Baking Co episode of Kitchen Nightmares #shitfest2014
@fivehundy too bad you can't eat to get #shitfest2014 started...Olive Garden always seems to do the trick

Dr appt for baby girl today. She's healthy &amp; strong. In other news, the husband got the rotavirus vaccine diaper change. #victory #EpicMess
Why does my dumb ass always wind up wearing a red shirt to Target...and why do people ask for help from a woman with 2 kids in a red shirt?
These are the feelings I will remember so I never make a "new mom" feel this way.
They're also the first ones to say "enjoy the time! It flies by." Again...no shit. You too were new to this once.
It would be lovely if "experienced" moms would quit chastising "new" moms with "when they get older, you'll understand." No shit.
Dr appt for baby girl today...usually not much fun for anyone.
Seeing things in a better light after making pancakes for dinner. Pancakes always seem to make things better.

Suppose I'll backup the photos and take a break.
I suppose it is easier to just remove the forum where all this happens. Then perhaps conversations won't have to include "I saw on FB"
I have had horrible things said to me, about me on Facebook &amp; misunderstandings that would be avoided by speaking in person
It's my fault for posting an opinion. It was begging to be argued with.
I really need to re-evaluate how, or if I ever again, use Facebook. Relationships seem to be entirely too fragile there.
Fuck it. I'm done...need a break

@anitamartini I lose my mind a little every time I see your name misspelled, as I too know the pain.
Damnit people... RT @TheBraiser  Uh, "uni is the new bacon?" Our breakfast-loving hearts can't handle that. 
Starting off my Sunday by crushing the hopes &amp; dreams of the folks in line behind me at Panera. #AllTheSoufflés
Kiddo is not on board with the idea of wearing his jammies today...Completely bottomless seems to be his preference. Never a dull moment.

Thank goodness for gorgeous spring days, little victories, &amp; red wine...&amp; cannolis.
Here's what's ruining my lovely spring day...trucks number 27, 28 &amp; 29 so far. 
Another one of those "octopus falling from the sky" kind of nights...
Just me, a glass of Chardonnay &amp; the birds  
This is not only what it is like in my home, but is a pretty darn accurate representation of what it's like... 
Ok...so maybe we aren't done swaddling. Maybe we just need to duct tape her in it... #TrialAndErrorAndErrorAndError
You know your toddler has you trained when you log onto Amazon Instant Video &amp; automatically choose Bob the Builder.
Well...at least I've got a backlog of DVR to keep me company tonight #AllNighter
Dreading what you know is going to be a long night/week is not a fun way to spend the day.
Ok then... 
May have to keep the coffee pot on for most of the day. Last night was brutal.
Hey, UASF...don't suppose we could do these sorties when it isn't nap time? Or send someone to watch the baby after you wake her up.
Razzberries 
What diabolical forces make it so I'm up with the kiddos all night when we have places to be the next day...
One of those mornings where my blankets feel like they weigh a ton &amp; someone will need dynamite to blast me out of bed.
Damned if i do. Damned if i don't. Damned if i tried. Damned if i even considered it.
Curious who decided "ya know what? I'm not nearly ashamed enough when I eat a Cinnabon...so lets make it a vodka flavor!"
I just love that 5 minutes of downtime in between putting one kiddo down for a nap &amp; the other kiddo waking up from a nap...
Funny how it was fun to do the shopping for half price clothing for the kids....but when I get it home it all magically turns into laundry.

@7BOOMERESIASON congrats on joining the "rich white male commenting on taking away women's personal liberties" club! #LearnYourPlace
@7BOOMERESIASON since you feel qualified to have opinions on women's reproductive health, which IUD would you suggest?
@7BOOMERESIASON then again, my husband's job isn't anything as important as baseball....say, national security.
@7BOOMERESIASON I'm just lucky my husband is poor enough to be able to stay home &amp; help me after my c-section. no nurse for me.
@7BOOMERESIASON and your 2009 "Father of the Year Award" should be revoked.
@7BOOMERESIASON glad the health of the mother &amp; child pales in comparison to baseball season. Fantastic message to future fathers, jackass
@7BOOMERESIASON I can only assume the uterus you have been hiding qualifies you to suggest a woman be needlessly sliced open for convenience

My Red Sox may have lost today, but at least it wasn't the worst loss of the day. #OuchRockies

Damaging winds AND a dust storm warning? Well that sounds like a fresh bucket of suck today.
Perhaps one day I could pick @RidingShotgunLA's brain about starting a food truck. His book is the next best thing.

@fivehundy before you commit too much time to farming, you cannot grow money, bacon or whiskey.
@fivehundy I'll look for it in my grocery store when I'm up an hour earlier.
@fivehundy well, that's fair &amp; logical. What are you farming again?

Chris woke-up and decided he's making a cherry clafouti for breakfast.
Busy day. Now it's time for everyone's favorite game: what time will the baby wake up?! Answer: when I lay down to fall asleep.
Excited kiddo starts gymnastics today. He could definitely use the exercise &amp; I probably need to be re-socialized.
As much as I want to be a good neighbor, I'm not really interested in helping our neighbor move her mother...again...

The good news is, I may be more than happy to oblige your assertion of being a "bitch". I am quite accomplished, actually.
And inventing words in your drunken stupor is just plain silly...or so says this "pathetic complainey white girl bitch".
If being drunk is the only time you can "speak the truth", that says more about your lack of emotional constitution than your opinion of me.
@oupiglet ***HUGS!!!***
The hatred directed at us this morning made us stronger. We know who loves us. Gonna pull them closer to block the view of hate.
Been a long few days. Gonna follow Frank's advice to pick myself up, dust myself off &amp; start all over again....starting with some sleep.
And I do care what people think of me. Even of you don't like me, I hope I've shown respect &amp; can at least have that in return.
Fear is powerful &amp; scary. What you fear is no excuse to spread hurt. Hopefully I mitigated the online damage...the rest will take a while
Tonight was the 1st time I witnessed someone destroy their "glass house" &amp; use the shards to hurt others. They've done considerable damage.
Was not a good night, at all. Memories we never, ever wanted to make. Damage done &amp; sleep lost. Learned who I never want to be.
I've tried to approach FB with some humor, especially when commenting on my views/experiences. Some people just want to hurt you. Badly.
Might be time for a Facebook break. Play nice &amp; try to spread a little happiness, friends.
Awake for 24 hours? Sure, why the hell not. Isn't like I need sleep or anything. #SofaKingExhausted

Dear sweet jeebus, enough with with "Mile High" recreational marijuana sales jokes. It's lazy.
@dslifton just another reason on the list of why I'm jealous of you.
@dslifton that is such a stunning view.
Here's what I'm work-shopping for next year; 1st Annual Tournament of Roses Parade, Drag Race &amp; Demolition Derby.
What kind of lazy ass parade float planner (is that a thing?) defaults to "Who let the dogs out" for a dog themed float?
The way the E-Harmony guy described the participants of his float just isn't sitting right with me...
Uhhhh...won't be watching that 'Resurrection' show...nope. Why is there SO MUCH CREEPINESS TODAY?!?
My personal hell would have to be one of those people who has to dance next to a parade float.
HOLY HELL, the babies on the Kiaser Permanente float are the single creepiest thing I've ever seen.  #RoseParadeOfHorrors
Apparently I was at the Tournament of Roses parade 29ish years ago.

Hey, @rockabyebaby...how bout "Lullaby Renditions of Hall &amp; Oates"? Pretty please.

@dwalsh76 pretty much. Not going to eliminate the possibility just yet.

Shortest day of the year, ha
I was up at 5am with the kids. Not that short of a day.
I learned that that Madilynne shares a birthday with Keith Richards, Ty Cobb, @KariByron , Ray Liotta, Betty Grable &amp; Jacques Pepin.
Now that we have cable, Chris can try to get kiddo to watch soccer. Apparently we are rooting for Liverpool.
Chris decided to give another part of our soul to Comcast &amp; setup cable TV. Now kiddo has been exposed to commercials &amp; he is NOT a fan.
I forgot the coffee I made pre-third trimester is likened more to rocket fuel. #NoMoreHeartburn
Was so nice to "sleep" in my own bed. But I'm more excited about the amazing cup of strong coffee I am about to enjoy.
Apparently bringing a new baby home to a house with a toddler "only gets funner". I really hope the grammar gets more better too.
I cannot thank everyone enough for their support &amp; love on this exciting, scary, painful &amp; joyous day.
@oupiglet got a little rest, but pain is getting more intense.
So...what's everyone else up to at this hour?
@oupiglet not much happening yet. Ger some rest for me...gonna be a long night
@oupiglet lol! Me too!!!
I know everyone wants to know...Chris is doing ok. I think he'll make it.
Time to watch the clock and lose my mind.
How can people not understand that just because I've been in labor before, it doesn't negate the fear. Now I know how much it hurts!!
I know better...the double-standards have existed for longer than I can remember. Why fight it now...even imminent labor changes nothing.
I should not be this unhappy today. I should be excited instead of meeting the needs of the rest of the world. Tempted to turn off my phone.

@ThirdboneEats LOVE the idea of rice krispie treats replacing cupcakes...or those goddamned cake pops. Looks amazing!
I just saw a streak of pale butt-cheeks &amp; heard "I'm naked in the kitchen." Chris is sober, so I think it was kiddo.
I have been very specific telling my family if they get me season 4 of Community for Christmas, they will be disowned.
