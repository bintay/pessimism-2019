@chrisgildert83 @PhilBirdBFC ohhhh, 3 wins EVER. Now I get it <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@PhilBirdBFC where have you found that extra away win from Phil! 3 would have been great! Thinking about the point at the Bridge?
@NoNayNeverNet ok cool ta. Think I'll write something about turning points/what happens next. Just email it when I'm done?
@gankshire well of course, that's an ambitious back 4, but we'll see

Now it looked a poor decision to send Duffo off in real time. Seeing it again, it's so much worse. THREE covering defenders. Sickener
Ward needs a place in the team and the width we so badly need could come more easily with wingbacks.Taylor-Jones-Arfield CMs #twitterclarets
Could we try a Leicester-style 5-3-2? Keane-Shacks-Mee CBs, Ward LWB, Tripps RWB? Nothing to lose, might as well try #twitterclarets
Completely speechless at people calling for Dyche to leave. Unbelievable. #twitterclarets
If paying ¬£43 to see ANOTHER sub-par ref reduce the game to nothing after 15 minutes is the premier league, it can piss off #twitterclarets
Shackell showed once again that he's capable at this level today. Be shocked if we keep hold of him in the summer #twitterclarets
Yet again, @jimmy9 the only one from Burnley to have any luck today
No lack of effort today, game was over after the red. Hull's a relegation party next weekend. It's the hope that kills ya! #twitterclarets
@Joe_Wignall honestly it looked horrendous. Such a shame, it's killed the game
Duff got done by a drop of the shoulder, can't argue with the pen. Red is so harsh. Hope it's not his last act as a claret #twitterclarets
Devastating decision. Completely killed the game, hard from our angle to see but there HAD to be covering defenders?! #twitterclarets
@Aaron97BFC I hope to god that's not what happens. Pretty sure it won't
Ashley Barnes has a lot to make up for after Everton. Will be very helpful for his game to finally see him back up top #twitterclarets
@ben_hogan91 did I say I was interested?! I think it's all very OTT, I just expect to see lots of union jacks later
It certainly is only a game. But by heck it's a big one today. Win or bust, would love to at least celebrate a goal.. #twitterclarets

@peejfitz in terms of actually answering the questions they were asked,Cameron might as well have not been there. Enjoyed the stumble though

@PaulMulderrig @Clivesworld I'm informed by a reliable source that his appearance at BRGS was "laughable" and "he doesn't have a clue"...
What an effort that is by Bournemouth. Nice little club, best of luck to them. Howe must be pleased he moved back now!
The only problem with #CarShare is having to wait for everyone else to see it and share the hilarity. So funny, and so clever

@jsalter9 yeah coz they have a few players who can provide a spark. Really don't see it happening at all
Well at least someone's done Burnley proud again today. G'lad @jimmy9
@jsalter9 we realistically have to win 3 of 4 and we've won 5 in 34 so far. You're right though, next week is a must win
Always said if we could go into the last game at Villa with a chance it would be an achievement. Now, it'd be a miracle #twitterclarets

@NoNayNeverNet their goal had everything we lack: incisive, quick passing, top delivery, huge slice of luck. That's that...

@SussexClaretBFC hmm find that a tough one to agree with, Jones has run marathons recently, he just needs a calming partner in there
@SussexClaretBFC aye could get Arfield back out wide too. Only risk is loss of energy/all left foot in CM
Back west for a rather huge #twitterclarets game tomorrow. Taylor from the start? He's shown enough for me. Really do need all 3 in this one

This decision by UEFA to restart the U19 game from the 96th minute penalty sets a massive precedent! No pressure on the taker....!!!

Very different article to my earlier tweet today. @piersmorgan is unfortunately very much correct here :/

Looks like an evening in front of the TV on Saturday for me then, wasn't on the ball with Arsenal tickets... ffs


Quite literally the saddest journalism ever. Suspend your disbelief, it's a bloody film ffs #BondIsInvincible

@ClaretsStore Are Arsenal online sales closed? It looks as though zero availability. Even single seats?

‚Äú@GBury_17: I wonder how many people think their dad would enjoy a pint with Nigel Farage. I certainly know mine would <CONFUSED FACE>‚Äù

Depressingly true
The less said about Farage the better. Disgusting "politics". HIV comments a complete disgrace. "Outward facing" my arse #leadersdebate
Ed would have done ok but for his strange camera stares. His PR team need to earn their money in the next month! #leadersdebate
Sturgeon good at debating, no doubt. Can't accept it as a viable way forward though. Bennett &amp; Wood fairly irrelevant... #leadersdebate
Glad Cameron, despite best efforts, finally had to face up to proper debate. Intriguing "gloves off" feel with him &amp; Clegg #leadersdebate
Where to start on #leadersdebate reflection? Overall, a snapshot of just how diverse a government we can expect after May 7th #AllToPlayFor
Also realising how much the change to electoral registration will affect turnout in #Election2015 
So many don't realise, expect low turnout
No pressure @julieetchitv but just don't be as much of a tosser as Burley or Paxman last week. Moderator, not inquisitor... #leadersdebate
Personally I'll be out during the #leadersdebate but straight on it when I get in. Fully expect a free-for-all with Farage as jester
#leadersdebate day. Sure I won't be the first, or the last, to comment on the irony that Cameron will stand on the far right of the stage...
In the words of Steffen Freund, ARBEIT!

A triumphant 12 hours of fooling this morning, beginning with @Tiff_Robin in the early hours and then teaming up with @rachlaaar today ;)
Omg @gregjames has seriously started something with these TV theme tunes. BBC news theme full blast in the car was an experience @BBCR1
Evan Davis has all the credibility that Paxman lacks. Hard questioning without the patronising twattishness which Paxo exudes. Enjoyable


Admittedly that wasn't the most marvellous effort. Bit of a random rewording. Largely legit though.

Was out so will watch #BatleForNumber10 tomorrow. From reading Twitter, though, I can already tell Paxo &amp; (especially) Burley will rile me..
Those eight minutes must have been completely horrific for the other crew members. Small mercy in knowing that the 140+ others were unaware
Terrifying news coming out of France. One man's whim led to 150 deaths. Horrendous

@jsalter9 he looks good from the 10 mins I've seen. You need to go up to have a chance of signing him surely?
@jsalter9 looks like he's got a big future. Sign him up Dyche lad

Neville just said "I don't think anyone's amused". No Gary, I really, really am. PSG were awesome with 10 men. Chelsea are a disgrace

@ben_hogan91 yeah but we could be adrift by then. 4 wins from 28, not likely to win 4 in 10 now :p oh well, it's been fun
@ben_hogan91 look at our fixtures. We might need to win 4 of our last 5. Will be tough. Thank god for Heaton...

@TheChelseaBlog absolutely, and you're entitled to. It changes absolutely nothing, history will always have 1-1 in its books :)
@TheChelseaBlog judgement calls! It's a matter of opinion! IMO both teams should have had 1 pen, both handballs. Just an OPINION
@TheChelseaBlog better ways of acting though,he's losing so much respect. Saturday was a fair score, you're conveniently forgetting a lot!
@TheChelseaBlog similar incidents, very different reactions from Jos√©! Funny that, lots of positive reaction to his calm, dignified response
@TheChelseaBlog an explanation rather than a defence. He passes the ball, that's quite clear. Review Jos√© on Mikel's tackle in 2013 <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@TheChelseaBlog you must have been busy to have surveyed 60 million+ people since Saturday! SD has more class in his little toe than Jos√© <SMIRKING FACE>
Solid, if not spectacular follow-up series from #Broadchurch 

Intrigued enough to be impatient for series 3 :D
Interesting that the chief writer for The Guardian comments on the "new stuff" at the end of SD's video. Such narrow viewfinders!
Had to be not guilty, wouldn't have been realistic if not after that case. Brilliant that Hardy arrested her in court #BroadchurchFinale
"Oversight" used in place of "disrespectful disgrace" is now my favourite new lexical switch #twitterclarets #Dycheisms
And a very good point that when all this dies down, we'll only remember that we got a point at the best team in the country #twitterclarets
Good that SD also shed a little light on the incidents late in the game which the media seem to have conveniently "missed" #twitterclarets
Very good reaction from Dyche in his @ClaretsPlayer interview. Honest, concise and NOT defamatory, unlike some... #twitterclarets
Back in Yaaarkshire just in time for #BroadchurchFinale please let it be satisfying... I'm thinking #NotGuilty
I love it when sense prevails. Hilarious that it's even got this far. Unlucky Jos√©, now sit down #twitterclarets #AyeAyeAshleyBarnes
By trying to get Barnes suspended, Chelsea are trying to remove him from games against their title rivals. Clever.. #twitterclarets
I hope I'm not naive in thinking the FA will have the balls to quickly reject Chelsea's ridiculous appeal...
Double standards to the extreme by Jos√© isn't it. Imagine if another manager called his player criminal. For a pass... #twitterclarets

Goals on Sunday this week- A spoilt child ma‚Ä¶
Good on Stelling yesterday and Ben Sheperd today on actually having the balls to not tow the party line and suck up to Mourinho...
Feel like Jos√©'s biggest problem is his false definition of an 'opinion' as a 'fact'... #GoS
Sure Jos√© will discuss the game in a completely fair way on Goals on Sunday.... Hmmmmm <SMIRKING FACE>
Sometimes I wish I could retweet and favourite my own tweets. We are the longside, Burnley....
Barnes was overzealous rather than malicious. Question is, WHO CARES. Smashed Chelsea's back line and Leicester Sq casino and WE'RE SUPERIOR

@yamreid how dare they! I'm the same tbf, I quietened down for a while but am back in Twaddiction mode now...
Broadchurch has been outdone by #EELive on the cliffhanger front this week! Absolute TV event going down right here
@yamreid I think I could do most foods, but Twitter... Now that's big
@yamreid how do you even go bigger than chocolate?! I feel like you're then getting into alcohol territory and ain't nobody got time... Etc

Last empty weekend for a while over with, and what a pleasure it was. Lazy Sunday = films. Non Stop &amp; The Grand Budapest Hotel <MOVIE CAMERA>
@Robynf_ BUT HE DRIVES A PORSCHE INTO A PLANE ROBYN. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT 

(yeah it was actually pretty poor...) <AIRPLANE>Ô∏è<AUTOMOBILE>
BBC pundits laughing about how boring this game is. Not really funny is it, bit of a joke that you chose this game at all... #FACup
Standard Friday night then. Listen to about 457937 freshers avin it large, then suddenly I'm applying for a job in Florida. Eh? #Lolimagine
Following on from #Cucumber congrats to everyone involved in #Tofu tonight <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@yamreid every time Edna said "deliberately" I died
@yamreid genius move to get Dame Edna and the Ab Fab team on. Lumley is a bloody legend
#Cucumber just gets better every week. Laughed a lot this week, and Henry's little rant was <OK HAND SIGN>
First part of #Cucumber summed up what a hilarious concept it is. I can't...
I spend the vas majority of my daily life these days searching for the correct emoji for any given situation...<NEUTRAL FACE> (&lt;this even took me 2 mins)
@alandonelan haha that kit... Don't even ask! It's so ironic coz Smalling was awful other than scoring twice. You got away with one <PENSIVE FACE>
@mrdanwalker we melted down the bazillion pounds (in 50p pieces) won through promotion and forged the shirts. Third kit, thankfully...
@dancon73 Yep, so frustrating. Think it's psychological now too. Dyche can only do so much, down to the players in the end
@nihaoxiongmao absolutely, there's no doubt in that. But people are talking as if we just wave a magic wand and it will be fine. Naive
"Defending corners rests with Dyche". I don't believe it's in the rules for him to do that himself. Although he might do a better job
Unbelievable that Dyche is getting stick. Do people think he just doesn't work on corners?!Not the kind to ignore a problem! #twitterclarets
Ings, Jones and Kightly excellent tonight. Only hope this is not a sign of things to come. Onto the next biggun! #twitterclarets
Not seen a score not reflect a game like that for a long time. That's the PL I guess. Only so far pride can carry you #twitterclarets
Such an excellent performance first half. Pretty much the exact same end to it as Sunday. Same again! #twitterclarets
At least we're consistent. #EveryHeaderAGoal #twitterclarets
Clarets fans, you sound brilliant #InOurLancashireHomes
Not seen that for a while! Yes @trippier2 @IngsDanny #twitterclarets

@alandonelan nightmare! I'd avoid my Twitter feed if I were you then! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>still, good reason to miss it. Why were you there??
Another one of those days where friendships are temporarily postponed. Se√±or @alandonelan it's time for the BATTLE OF THE LONG BALL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
The only way Australia can make up for the farce of them actually competing in Eurovision is to make Natalie Imbruglia enter with Torn
It's bloody pointless rehashing the "CM in January" line again. That's gone, this was horrendous timing. Fingers crossed #twitterclarets
That's just about the worst news possible. Timing couldn't possibly be worse. Oh Deano :( #twitterclarets
Olivia Colman was another level of fierce tonight #Broadchurch #Intrigue
Although the predictable fallout will be laughable at times I'm sure. Intrigued to see what's next. Keep Albus in mind at all times <PENCIL>Ô∏è<WHITE MEDIUM STAR>Ô∏è<RAINBOW>
After all that, all it took was a couple of American kids, an iPad and me rambling. A drop in the ocean. Let's go, #onwards
@yamreid distinct lack of a dog or indeed top hat figure from the project too
What a complete legend Mike Leigh #Baftas2015
Still makes me laugh seeing Frank Leboeuf in clips of The Theory of Everything. Such a random career path #Baftas2015
Think the lesson we've all learned is if you're going to be revelatory, don't take 43 minutes to do it <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> <RAINBOW>
Are Leicester trolling the world....
Harsh when you consider what he did for them last season, but probably their only chance of staying up. Hope they take zero impetus....
Actually disappointed that Pearson's been sacked. His ridiculous behaviour this season, esp. yday, has taken from Leicester's chances
@NorAmClarets Yep, the absolute tosser! :p
@NorAmClarets oh yeah you can't doubt his record. Just not at all enjoyable to watch. They were gifted a point today really :/
Barnes and Mee great today too. Credit to them both after last week. Bring on the big guns <SMIRKING FACE><SOCCER BALL>Ô∏è #twitterclarets
Tony Pulis is so anti-football isn't he. Attritional, terrible. Just couldn't find the key to unlock that 2nd half #twitterclarets
Frustration. Good performance today, much improved. 2 corners makes it even more annoying given that we played well #twitterclarets
WBA been unambitious. No surprise. Predictable to concede then from a set play. Big first 15 in 2nd half #COYC #twitterclarets
Also anyone got a bit fan to blow away this fog? Like the game's being policed by dementors...
@SteveWilson1967 what did you expect realistically Steve ;)
Frosty, foggy, freezing. Pressure's on them, esp their new signings. Big need for us to bounce back though. Let's ave it #twitterclarets
Could be a spot the ball competition today. Last time it was this foggy we went 3-0 up against Derby early on. Repeat please #twitterclarets
This must be the earliest I've ever seen us KO? Hardly any time to do anything this morning. Even v Rovers we start later #twitterclarets
This week's been tremendous really, overall. The conclusion to it rests, naturally, on 90 minutes at Turf tomorrow. Nervous tension. Sleep <SLEEPING SYMBOL>
Nigel Pearson's got a bit of a screw loose hasn't he? That was very strange and quite disconcerting with McArthur #MOTD

Check out @iamNathanMoore on #TheVoice tonight. If anyone ever asks where he learnt his French, just call me ;) #MyOwnAlumnus #LikeSeriously
At least she's honest that she's been boring. Hilton acting like its a victory for him. How have we not deported him yet? #CBB
Emma went for Hopkins there! Wish she'd had that gumption when she was grilling Perez the other day ffs #CBB
@Robynf_ yeah I don't really get it, I suppose she's down to earth but without the "Jordan" character she's beige!
It's the most disappointing winner since that Welsh girl called Rachel won the civilian BB. Booooooorrrrinnnnnnnng #CBB
@Robynf_ faaaaaaakin hell so disappointing!!! She literally did NOTHING x
That is the single greatest anticlimax in the history of British television. Way to ruin a magnificent series you boring sods #CBB
It's the final interviews and all I can watch is effing dickhead P*rez and his little puppet sidekick Nadia in the background #joke #CBB
@Robynf_ yeah it's been such a great series and if she wins it will ruin it! She's just got loads of deluded fans, grrrr <ANGRY FACE><ANGRY FACE>
Yes Hopkins is a bit of a dick. But at least she's not beige. Simply for her hatred of P*rez, hope she wins #CBB
Seriously, Katie Price can't win this. In the best series ever, she's been totally none. Probably will win now though :/ #CBB #TeamHopkins
Quite shocked at Michelle in 5th! Has to be either Calum or Hopkins to win it now. Would only be fitting #CBB
V.good interview by SD. Reminded me of his pre-season one before last season, so +ive. Have to follow that this weekend #twitterclarets

Complaining at early starts and then realising it's 2 years today since I left for Austria, where I got up at 6:20 every day for months...
And to think, cucumber used to just be a boring, tasteless salad item. I'll never look at it the same again thanks to Russell TD! So so good
Credit to Dimbleby for keeping some form of control on #BBCQT in the debate about Anti-Semitism. Shouting helps nobody for goodness sake
I do like Tristram Hunt, he's one of the more credible politicians out there. Lots of cheap shots at him already.. #bbcqt
Since when was 9pm Thursday the busiest TV slot ever? All of the first world viewing and catching up problems...
Clarke confirms what we all feared. Can't imagine how difficult it was to speak out.Kudos &amp; all of the luck in his recovery #twitterclarets
Think the main problem with Perez is what he views as "funny", millions of people view as disgusting #CBB
Listen to the sound of sympathy from the public Perez... #tumbleweed #bullshit #CBB
I have an idea on how to "protecting yourself" Perez. Don't be a complete tosspot in the first place... #CBB
Fingers crossed Emma doesn't hold back in the interview. After all that empty noise he looks gutted <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #Perez #CBB

@jsalter9 haha I know, it's worked though up to nearly 1500 views. Got to try :)
Need Ward &amp; Taylor back sharpish for the experience in the run in, just hope the squad holds out. All fun and games! #twitterclarets
Little risk garnered little reward in 09-10. Fingers crossed for a better outcome this time. Have to believe #twitterclarets
No plan B then. Is it possible that SD can perform another miracle and make plan A work again... Ugh #twitterclarets
I thought the appointment of Brian Laws was bad enough, but if we sign Paul McShane in a late-night #DeadlineDay deal, I'll be flabbergasted
Calum Best's mum just killed the whole country <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #CBB
Will have the nightmare later of trying to keep up with #DeadlineDay on Twitter but also avoiding #Broadchurch spoilers. It's a tough life
In all seriousness though we need a midfield plan B. Imagine if he pulled Tim Cahill out of the hat. Probably could as well #twitterclarets
Back to Lansbury again. Think there might be more chance of signing Angela than Henri with our bargaining skills #twitterclarets #oldschool
@NoNayNeverNet @GBury_17 haha! Give it a chance and we'll make the next one landscape just for you :p

Thought you'd heard the best Sean Dyche impression this week? Think again... 

Please RT &amp; share #twitterclarets
Darren Farley's Dyche impression is very poor! Lots of Scouse in there and hardly uses any Dyche-isms. Wait for @GBury_17 to do much better
A mixture of Djokovic stepping it up and Murray beating himself up mentally isn't looking good :/ #AusOpenFinal
Very quickly over the fact that England got spanked in the cricket as I'm transfixed by the tennis. Battle of the Titans #AusOpenFinal
Still, could be far worse. Huge game next week now with the run of games after that #twitterclarets #onwards
Ings to drop back as the extra man in midfield? Arfield needs a break? Main worry is we're being bullied out of it #twitterclarets
Back from a long and disappointing day. Feels like we've got 48 hours to buy a plan B, there isn't one at the mo #twitterclarets
Should be utterly knackered but that away day feeling carrying me onwards. Now this is a biggun... #twitterclarets #believe
@Robynf_ he was fairly quiet, lots more "I know everything and don't care" bullshit, Kav had a good go at him. Nadia gone THANK GOD x
I like the public's ploy of removing all of P*rez's allies in order to slowly destroy him. Seems like the most fair way... #CBB
@TheKopTalk Yep then sold the man who took you there. Look at the bigger picture. I don't need to be a comic you're funny enough! Also, *Kay
‚Äú@TheKopTalk: haha we have 5 european cups you have a Johnston Paints trophy course we have different expectations to you‚Äù Having fun <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@TheKopTalk omg I'm not comparing the expectations! They are both relative to their particular situations. Ours are realistic, yours aren't
@TheKopTalk not very quick on the uptake are you? I said we have a realistic fanbase to our particular situation, Liverpool don't. Simple!
@ben_hogan91 haha I don't think they'll allow that. I expect it'll be around 3-5 mil, maybe more if he gets into the england squad
@ben_hogan91 yeah, you won't get him this window that's for sure, just depends on how much the tribunal makes you pay in June <MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG><MONEY BAG>
@ben_hogan91 rule v7 of the PL rules apparently, look it up :p fairly embarrassing for all involved really
Actually dying right now that @rachlaaar just saw Sherlock being filmed in Bristol. The fangirl in me wants to go there RIGHT NOW
@alandonelan totally agree, said the exact same to Ben earlier. Would have been the wrong move. Haha surely that's BREAKING NEWS for Sky!
@ben_hogan91 now it turns out your club don't even know the rules of the game! Typical
@alandonelan he's not going, apparently it's against the rules. It was 100% legit interest, but it can't happen apparently <THUMBS UP SIGN><INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
Love Friday evenings.Time to box off the translation part of life and fully focus on the footie. Strange, cross-country journeys,let's go <SOCCER BALL>Ô∏è
@TheKopTalk who has ambitions to win the league? A fanbase living in the 80s? Realism is a great tonic, that's why we at Burnley are smiling
@ben_hogan91 that's legit, it was definitely our fault that he did his ACL...
@TheKopTalk you misunderstand me I think. What I mean is Ings will be worth ¬£20mil+ in years to come...
@ben_hogan91 look what happened with Rodriguez, we simply breed good strikers. Ings will be in the England squad within 12 months
@ben_hogan91 oh I absolutely agree that it's not a good move for him, LFC isn't a good step. But trust me he's far better than Borini
@ben_hogan91 Danny Ings. Are you as misguided and rose-tinted as the rest of your club's fans about this one?
In my experience of us in the PL (09-10 &amp; this year),Liverpool fans have been far and away the most underwhelming. SUCH a myth #RealityCheck
@TheKopTalk you have no idea what a bargain you're getting do you... <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
‚Äú@JNorthcroft: Ings a smart move by Liverpool... Rodgers will know all about his character through friendship with Dyche.‚Äù @GBury_17 #bantz
Lots and lots and lots of giggles at #Cucumber on C4
Funny that 43 minutes could change a lot of things <VIDEO CAMERA>

Premier League goals this season:

Ings 7
Lambert 2
Borini 1
Balotelli 0
@Robynf_ hopefully! The 'send me home' stuff is defo the fakest thing I've ever seen... X
Sad to see Sch√ºrrle on the verge of leaving the PL. Outstanding footballer and finished off one of the best goals I've ever seen recently!
@Robynf_ I like them both I just can't believe how much they're trusting Perez! I love how "playing a game" is negative...It's a gameshow :p
@Robynf_ I'm so pleased there at least some intelligent ppl who haven't just swallowed his BS. Pricey and Cheggers are mugs too! X
Enjoy the fitting hilarity that when it snows, humans start walking like penguins in order not to slip... <PENGUIN><SNOWFLAKE>Ô∏è
I don't know what happened but I think I just did work 4 weeks in advance. Worried for my own sanity #OrganisationFTW
@Robynf_ yeah that's the problem he's probably really insecure really, he's gonna regret it so so much x
@Flemly hmm basing it purely on the series, either Calum or Michelle. Think Hopkins might sneak it though yknow! X
@Robynf_ hahaha I love how much you share my hatred :p get him STRAIGHT on a plane out of here afterwards <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>x
Of all the bloody things to get addicted to the week I'm back working, YouTube channels are not the one. Wasting my LIFE here (but loving)
@Flemly Perez has built his career on exactly the same kind of "bullying", as you call it, as Hopkins. But yeah, brilliant series!
@Flemly I just keep thinking that this man has a 2 year old son, I would be absolutely ashamed to have someone so poisonous as a father
@Flemly obviously that's what she's doing, she's locked in a house. The majority that I know feel the same as I do, that's all I can go off
@Flemly Hopkins fans the flames but can't really blame her, I couldn't ignore that either. And trust me, what Michelle says is 100% correct
No matter what, it's undoubtedly been the best #CBB series ever. Outstanding by the producers!
@Flemly people have played the game well before, without offending and damaging a massive section of society outside. That's the difference
@Robynf_ 100%, makes my skin crawl. Everything in a person I can't stand
@Robynf_ well he's a true disgrace and the fact she's 'friends' with him is a joke. If someone licked his face he'd cry sexual assault!
@Robynf_ that's the worst thing, and I don't think she'll ever admit she's wrong! Love how she's just taking everything he says as gospel <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I hope Nadia Sawalha never works again after this. She's either an absolute mug or a disgrace #Puppet #CBB
Watching #CBB against all logic because I know I'll want to punch a wall when Perez gets back
The away goals rule in the League Cup semis is still as ridiculous as it was when it ruined a phenomenal night 6 years ago #twitterclarets
Solid plan to stay up so late and waste about 4 hours of my day watching (admittedly really great) YouTube vids. SWITCH BACK ON
I know it usually goes in phases but deary me this ones a strong phase! <RAISED HAND><VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
Brain successfully reengaged, I think. The news that my take-home tests are over the same w/e as the last home game is distressing, however
Anyway enough of that nonsense. All work no play encore une fois, yeah go on then... <SLEEPING SYMBOL>
Yes at times I highly disliked Speidi too, but I constantly can't stand who Perez supposedly "stands for". The man's a joke #CBB
Perez is similar to Speidi 2 years ago, except Speidi played the game admirably and cleverly. Perez is callous and vomit-inducing #CBB
Right, time to get back in the saddle I think. Not a good sign that I have a headache even before the stress starts again... <TIRED FACE><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>

#Corrie was so good tonight, think it's too late to knock Enders off its perch at the #NTA2015 though
Dread to think how long it's going to take me to get home after constant snow all day. Need to stock up on supplies in case of getting stuck
@NoNayNeverNet actually enjoyed that game after the first 6 minutes when the game was already gone. "This pitch is dangerous"
On the plus side, Rossendale looks like Narnia today <SNOWFLAKE>Ô∏è<WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Some cruel irony somewhere that I'm on the way to work near my old school while there's a snow day. Ah to be 11 again, best days ever
Love how although Katie P has been on the outside for a week watching, Perez still thinks he knows more than her <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #CBB
I'd either win or be physically assaulted I reckon... #EveryonesFriendNobodysEnemy
If I didn't have a career and all that stuff to think about I'd genuinely love to go in Big Brother for a summer and just chill out...
@yamreid don't be alarmed that two versions of me have followed. I had to create a prof account because I chat so much shit on this one (y)
Fitting that #Corrie was so excellent on the night of Anne Kirkbride's passing. RIP to a legend of British screen #RIPAnneKirkbride
Standard insomnia-driven YouTube trawling. My video history basically tells the story of my life <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><BABY ANGEL><VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è
Perez has successfully topped the list of hated celeb housemates by this point. Which he'll probably love, as it gives him recognition #CBB
@ben_hogan91 haha so laptop then. Not the same! :p
Currently 1-1 for Oscar picks for me between The Imitation Game (Cumbers) and TTOE (Jones). Many more to see in the next few weeks <MOVIE CAMERA><MOVIE CAMERA><MOVIE CAMERA>
@ben_hogan91 Have you streamed all these or been in the cinema all week?!
@ben_hogan91 interesting. Director?
In #TheTheoryofEverything Hawking is asked "What do cosmologists worship?" &amp; I can't help thinking the answer, now, would be his name...
#TheTheoryofEverything is simultaneously horrendously sad and hilariously uplifting. Redmayne and, in particular, Jones are impressive
@ben_hogan91 Imitation Game is very good, who's your best actor so far? Someone will have to go far to better Cumberbatch for me
@ben_hogan91 want to! Also American Sniper. Do you have a fave so far?
@ben_hogan91 you're such a film fascist! It was good, v. well directed and Felicity Jones was very good too
The Theory of Everything. Really want it to live up to the hype... <MOVIE CAMERA>
Has Ruud Gullit come straight from a special cafe in Amsterdam? #MOTD #nonsense

Might accidentally miss the first 20 mins of #MOTD I think... Don't need to see that again just yet #twitterclarets 
@NorAmClarets onwards and upwards! Another big game next time, have to believe
Reaction after HT becoming a worry. Have to stand up.Got bullied out of it today,not like us.2 weeks to dust ourselves down #twitterclarets
Gutted. Hate how much football influences the mood of the rest of the weekend like this <POUTING FACE>
Just caught up on #Cyberbully 
What a programme, seriously intense. Something about real-time that makes it so. @Maisie_Williams outstanding
Think it's going to be a dicey icy one tomorrow. Big game in the wintry weather, can't wait #twitterclarets
@Flemly Yep, you could probably say that about a few of them :/
@Flemly I agreed with what Michelle said just afterwards. The man's unhinged!
That's a shame. Chloe was far more interesting and entertaining on #CBB than last time on Ex on the Beach <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Thing is, Perez is so close to being right and playing the perfect game. Just overdoes it and goes from amusingly tactical to sickening #CBB
I think I was just sick in my mouth #Perez #CBB
Will judge Katie Price on one thing: how she treats Perez. Let's hope for a big custard pie #CBB
Jonathan #Agnew is on the brink of destroying any credibility he once had. His initial piece was very misguided, his "apology" feeble. Shame
Let's be honest there's always an American panto villain. Speidi, those twins, now Perez. Standard whiney moron #CBB
Catching up on #CBB and am horrified by how much I'm enjoying Hopkins. Perez is seriously awful if that's what he's achieving...
Solid effort by #Taken3 I must say. Neeson is the absolute don. Crashing a Porsche into a plane is the coolest thing I've ever seen
@NoNayNeverNet two nightmares in a row there, I'll just give up...
@NoNayNeverNet defensive lapses, had a mare with lack of characters there!
Shame about the lapses but best to get them out of the way tonight! Win Saturday and will never think of the FA Cup again #twitterclarets
Poor choice by the BBC maybe? Sordell and Wallace scoring in 7 minutes and something weird is happening... #twitterclarets
72 hours of almost constant translation and research has frazzled my brain. Heading back west for a week or so of chillllllllls
Hahaha Perez' face when he realised he was up for eviction <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #CBB
Perez is the blackest pot calling the kettle there has ever been... #attention #seeker 

Alicia's a mug too... #CBB
Perez Hilton is doing what nobody else could - making Katie Hopkins look good! Michelle's got to be favourite to win already, legend #CBB
Knew of @kate_abdo before but didn't know her backstory. What a woman! Linguist, top presenter, Northern and gorgeous to boot... <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
After a fully expected late-night stint of writing, we have one translation commentary complete. Quick sleep and onto more exams... <PENCIL>Ô∏è<MEMO>
What with Paris, the events in Nigeria and the Air Asia search, it's been a heavily saddening week for humanity. #Onwards is the only way
La Marseillaise is everywhere in Paris today. "Aux armes citoyens" et les "armes" d'aujourhui sont l'unit√©, la solidarit√© et l'expression
I've never seen anything like the scenes in Paris today. Millions of people representing the solidarity of millions more #NousSommesCharlie
@jsalter9 think he genuinely wants to leave and take his fee, but his views are true I think. Just old fashioned and out of touch
So good to be home today. #MOTD is a pleasure this evening <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è #twitterclarets 
@CharlotteRosie4 oh it was disgraceful and taking offence is fine, I didn't buy the "I don't feel safe" thing though. Wasn't about him
@CharlotteRosie4 trying to make it about himself makes him just as disgraceful because it belittles the incident itself. Man's a tosser
Shit's well and truly hit the fan in #CBB Jeremy you absolute tool. Perez immediately using it for camera time though, awful
Well 'Arry, @scottyarf certainly played like Messi today ;)
@RommelW12 <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Both goals absolutely class, Jones and Marney dominated. 3 more to the total :D #twitterclarets
Fully deserved! Love beating QPR, typical of the club that Hill &amp; Dunne were having a barney with the fans after the game! #twitterclarets
Taarabt, unexpected. Wonder which version will turn up....

Ah the old "he wants to go home" cop out. Nightmare, ruins the face-to-face noms. At least Hopkins gave a reason! #CBB
That article is why Vokes is up there with my favourite ever Burnley players. What a man #twitterclarets (also kudos to @NoNayNeverNet!)
Paris has seen some dark days, but this is turning into one of the worst. Unbelievable chaos
It's slightly too far when TV crews ignore police advice to advance into a town where a face-off is occurring, no? Let them do their job
@jsalter9 problem is this test hasn't even been that gripping but can't stop...
In all seriousness, progress is finally being made. Big week, cranking back up the old Gehirn for some √úbersetzung bantz #Onwards
"So when did you do most of your translation commentary?"

"During the lunch break of Aus-India Test Matches, of course..." #nocturnal <SLEEPING FACE>

Nothing personal against Andrej Kramaric, but I hope his dream PL move goes horrifically wrong. Bloody Leicester splashing the cash


This article from yesterday is already out of date @TeleFootball #awkward #twitterclarets @NoNayNeverNet #KeaneSigns
Chuffed with that, signing Keane permanently makes sense in every way possible #twitterclarets
Weird day off. Needed to work, was slowed down by the crazy news. 64 words written. Must do better asap #AllonsY
The money must seriously have run out to get him on #CBB though... #Alexander
Alexander O'Neil is an absolute don. Potential winner if he plays it right. Criticise is a tune! #CBB
I'm not snooty when it comes to celeb culture, but even for me it's a stretch to call Alicia a celebrity... #CBB #MickHucknall #hahaha
Such a tough task for Hopkins to be a judgemental tosser... Hmmmm

#Broadchurch brilliant as expected. I count about 7368756 unanswered questions. About as perfect as a series opener gets #BroadchurchReturns
Fair play to Spurs fans bringing 2,500 tonight. Play some good stuff when they turn it on. Will be a very tough replay #twitterclarets
Nobody wants a replay, but about what we deserved. Worth it just to see big Sam back playing &amp; scoring #twitterclarets
Last time we played Spurs @ Turf in January under the lights in the cup, it was equally incredible and awful. Let's go again #twitterclarets
@PipMac91 there are views on both sides I think!
Lots of work to do this week. Definitely the best plan to ignore that and get down't Turf tonight #twitterclarets #COYC #FaCup #rotation
This Ched Evans thing will keep happening. Club shows interest&gt;sponsors threaten to pull out&gt;club backs down. Money talks, 'twas ever thus
Trust @BBCR1 to smash it in the #HappyMonday stakes today. Outstanding effort
QPR so lucky. Green had to go, Henry too (always been a disgrace). Typical... #MOTD
Loved Szcesney's "I'll just drink this drink and everything will go away" reaction to his blunder <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #MOTD
@elemenoPtweets I'd love to discuss this but unfortunately you're making no sense...
@elemenoPtweets did I say it was on Twitter.... Moron
@JamieSmiff that's the spark which can win you a point/or 3
@JamieSmiff cross for the second goal- has anybody delivered as well as that since he last started?
And THAT is why I've been calling for Kightly to come back into the team for weeks. Imagine he might start soon... #twitterclarets
Another outstanding second half, particularly given the injuries. Relentless as ever. Deserved all 3! #twitterclarets
The only silver lining to this is that the window opens on Monday. Unbelievable bad luck #twitterclarets
Not sure we could lose two more important players than Dean and Shacks during a match. Games catching up with them? #twitterclarets
Beautiful way to bring in 2015, surrounded by the best of people and somehow turning Auld Lang Syne into the can-can... #HappyNewYear
@UnionJworld "Together" on the new album is perfect for Eurovision.... An absolute winner!

West Ham's 'goal' had to be ruled out. By moving out of the way, Sakho actively influences the ball going in the net...? #MOTD
Ciss√© has to be banned for Thursday after that?! Dirty #MOTD
@alandonelan hahaha but of course!
@alandonelan I will not be affiliated with this overconfidence,we're cautious up north ;) but yeah if we keep the manager, so much potential
@alandonelan we shall see, it'll go to the wire. Won't be for a lack of effort!
@alandonelan we were bloody fantastic second half. Couldn't deal with the lancashire scum!
Watching this with Dad (his first viewing) is so frustrating. No negativity necessary! #MOTD #twitterclarets
Argentina, that was embarrassing #TopGearPatagoniaSpecial
SD doing the same to Barnes as he did to Vokes last year. Transformation. Screamers starting to lose their 'surprise' factor #twitterclarets
How on earth do they have this much energy? Twice in 3 days, and we go again on Thursday! Still can't get over Barnes... #twitterclarets
Can't be underestimated how much it took to get anything out of that. 2nd half was heroic. And no subs! #relentless #twitterclarets #believe
Didn't think I could get any prouder to be a claret, but that was incredible. Ashley Barnes, you are a god #twitterclarets
Whatever happens now, this has been Barnes' best performance in a Burnley shirt. Absolutely outstanding today #twitterclarets #HoldOn
Chill out.... Where's that come from?! #twitterclarets #offsidewedontcare

Gutting today. First half was as good as we've been for a long time. Lpool very poor. Just missing that cutting edge. Hopeful #twitterblades
That famous Liverpool away support by the way - absolutely non-existent!! So underwhelmed
@ben_hogan91 we fucking dominated you first half. 16 shots, 0 on target. Fucking fuckers
Amazing to see Vokesy on the bench again. Think he'll be slightly more up for it than Mario if they get on... #COYC #twitterclarets
Come down and YNWA is playing on the radio (2br). Is that some kind of sick joke... #twitterclarets
@ben_hogan91 yo, hope you've had a nice xmas day, but hoping we RUIN your Boxing Day.... BRING IT

Obviously MC Tony Edwards rocked the mic, things haven't changed one bit guys. Always a pleasure to go back, but more than ever tonight
Tell you what though, there's a ridiculous amount of talent at @BRGS_SixthForm at the mo. They could do their own BGT series, seriously
So glad I came back for @GBury_17 concert. Not usually so vom, but I've never been prouder of you G #SmashedIt
Brilliant series of @PlebsComedy Grumio is definitely my favourite comedy creation in recent years. Hilariously inexplicable @MrRyanSampson
Germany 'would accept UK exit from EU' to protect migration rules - BBC News

Not surprised! Angie don't take no sh*t 
People may criticise Cheryl for miming (it was pretty poor...) but I'm going to take a guess and say she "doesn't care"? #XFactor

Has there been a bigger foot-in-mouth moment than the timeline of @educationgovuk today? Blithering idiots
Chris Smalling. Very intelligent... #awful
Also very glad I didn't see the spoiler coming.Anyone who works these things out early,you're missing out on the great moments ;) #DoctorWho
Still reeling from #DoctorWho

Love the 'power of words' element to it. So intrigued as to what comes next. Love Michelle Gomez too much.
I thought it was just a morbid Moffat indulgence. Then BANG that revelation. And by god what a casting Michelle Gomez is #DoctorWho
SHIT what an ending to #DoctorWho
@_richcunningham @NoNayNeverNet I've heard slingshots are available in the transfer window but "the market" is tough to deal in...
Lovely assist by Moreno for Newcastle's goal there... #tinpot #MOTD
Last week Eto'o, this week Sanchez. These former Barca players are seriously taking the piss at the moment... #unplayable #twitterclarets
How is Martin Keown being on #MOTD even a thing? I've seen more charisma in a potato
It looks like they've gold-plated Mr Tumnus... #XFactor #Andrea #StillSmashedIt
@ben_hogan91 haha very true. I was out of the country for that game, maybe I need to leave again to solve the problem #legitexcuse
@ben_hogan91 how much did you pay? He looked like the new Bale when he scored that goal at Spurs, but since then...
Also, I want some of whatever Lukas Podolski's on.... #cannon #twitterclarets
Ings looks like he's really warming to the PL. I very much envisage a string of goals in the near future #twitterclarets
D√©j√† vu of Chelsea away 5 yrs ago.Keeper MOM, fought valiantly but picked apart.That day Drogba was unplayable,today Sanchez #twitterclarets
@ben_hogan91 v true, massive overspending on Mignolet/Lovren. And who even is Markovic...
@ben_hogan91 well you know better than to rule me during a game. If only you had Sanchez/Eto'o/Bony/anyone except Mario...
@ben_hogan91 you can shut up, at least we're supposed to be shit unlike Liverpool
After all that, little Sanchez scores with a header? Such a shame. Floodgates are open now... #twitterclarets
I mean I'm not worried, they've only got Ramsey, Walcott and Podolski to come on... #twitterclarets
Sanchez is just ridiculous, here's hoping we can continue to keep him at arm's length 2nd half. Subs will have a big impact #twitterclarets
Sordell looking like a smart call by SD. Added movement has helped. Boyd needs to screw his head on, we need 11 men... #twitterclarets
#PlayingOnTheCounter #twitterclarets
Very interesting. So pleased to see Deano back,big call to throw Sordell in.Have to assume Juke's fit but going for pace #twitterclarets

Feel on the cusp of it really all kicking off. Think tomorrow's the start of a very full, tough 8 weeks. Bring it on #onwards

‚Äú@BPeacockBFC: SD: "We are not naive"... Surely being naive would encompass a failure to recognise being so?... #twitterclarets‚Äù 

Spot on
Having said all that, it was a pleasure to see Samuel Eto'o at least a figure of his former brilliant self. Impressive
Chalobah has to start, Arfield has to be back on the wing. Dyche's sub mentality is very puzzling too. Far too late #twitterclarets
‚Äú@NoNayNeverNet: Graeme Souness reckons Dyche will be out of a job if we haven't won at Christmas. Okay then... #twitterclarets‚Äù #Bellend
@alandonelan of course lad! 
Harsh on Mee but he's struggled so has to be the right call. Step up Stephen Ward #twitterclarets
Sky's stadium graphic makes Turf Moor look like it's in Middle Earth or something. Hilarious #twitterclarets
Still, we're on a super Sunday lineup alongside Chelsea &amp; United. It could be far worse. Let's earn that place #twitterclarets #relentless
Up against one of the nemeses of my time at a claret today. Martinez teams always do well at t'Turf. Another big test! #twitterclarets
Speaking of which, particularly enjoyable #DoctorWho tonight.Great premise, very much intrigued by the finale. Excited about Michelle Gomez
Still messes with my tiny mind that we can just change time. IT'S TIME, YOU CAN'T JUST MESS WITH IT. ASK THE DOCTOR
Good to see Jonathan Pearce has FINALLY got his head around goal line tech. Last time he was like a pensioner using an iPhone #MOTD

@ben_hogan91 don't ask me the history, they call Tlse the pink city in France...
I see it's Bath v Toulouse in the rugby. Not in any way interested in the game, but would love for Aquae Sulis to SMASH the pink city #frogs
That went as well as possible, I think. Now to head in my new favourite direction, east to see the <DOG FACE>:D
Hopefully this time tomorrow I'll have some part time work. I will definitely be in my own bed, which is always a plus. Allons y Lancashire

@Tiff_Robin same. I very much still want to see Rachel do her thing... <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
#SClub7 reuniting is glorious news. I do hope they can all still sing and Bradley's still got the moves or it will be highly underwhelming

Dear me @campbellclaret was absolutely jumped on there. Hugely, hugely misunderstood point he was making. Justice system there for a reason
#FreeSpeech is raising lots of fantastic talking points tonight. Really interesting and inspiring stories. Such an important subject

#SU2C was an absolute roller coaster, obviously. Nice to be at home and appreciate it after that
@JamieSmiff @NoNayNeverNet yeah, no brainer just a turn of phrase, doesn't have to refer to all brains haha! He's so much more of a threat
@JamieSmiff @NoNayNeverNet have done. Matter of opinion. In mine, we'd be mad to leave a fully fit Ings out. Entitled to yours too...

@britishpmaster my evidence is that I disagree with a vast number of their policies. That's my right, isn't it? Strange question
I'm very vocal about using your vote but honestly, I think abstaining would be better than a UKIP cross.That's how awful a prospect they are
Scarily, Farage is right- UKIP will gain a lot in the north thanks to the narrow-mindedness of many (IMO). This is NOT a way forward people!
The UKIP bandwagon rolls on I see. Not convinced it's truly a UKIP win but rather Clacton sticking by its MP, but still worrying
Really settled into postgrad life now. Interesting course, hard work, nice people. So, time for a pit stop. Bristol, Bath, let's go #Excited
@jsalter9 @ben_hogan91 hahaha oh JK. He needed his blue bolt close at that tough time. Little did he know what was to come in the final!
@jsalter9 @ben_hogan91 exactly. To find out what really happened I'd probably have to be that drunk again to reveal tbf
@ben_hogan91 @jsalter9 thirdly, re: the embarrassment itself, I'll stick with "I fell over on the way home" I think. Towing the party line
@ben_hogan91 @jsalter9 secondly, I think a lot of my rambling can be explained by events/announcements made in the following 6 months...
@ben_hogan91 @jsalter9 my response is threefold. Firstly I can't believe Salter recorded it and kept it quiet for 3 years!
@jsalter9 @ben_hogan91 haha I look forward to it! It's weird how much more northern I sounded in 2nd year too haha
@jsalter9 @ben_hogan91 It's very interesting to hear yourself drunkenly rambling...

And so it begins again. Students everywhere, enjoy the ride...
Chalobah showed a few good signs. Absolutely key to get Jones&amp;Marney back ASAP though, or at least one #twitterclarets
Taking arguably our four best players out of a team has to be taken into account but still, that was so poor. Gloomy times #twitterclarets
Didn't expect many thrashings this year due to our organisation. Particularly not expected at teams like WBA. Shattering #twitterclarets
Meanwhile Burnley have been so poor. Injuries have decimated our core and I have no clue how we come back from here #twitterclarets
Mixed emotions in the last hour. So pleased with the win for Europe, it's been absolutely epic #RyderCup2014
Outstanding GMac. Absolutely bloody out of this world #RyderCup2014
Meanwhile at the Hawthorns... Tough to take with no Marney/Jones. Huge test for Reid/Arfield. Glad Boyd's behind Juke #twitterclarets
Rory would have beaten anyone in the history of golf today. Majestic. Ride the wave Europe #RyderCup2014

#GoEurope #RyderCup2014
As if my life isn't golfy enough right now, agreed to play at 8am <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY> 100% going to bringing out some Poulter fistpumps #FeelTheNoise

Also West Ham, are you watching the same replay as the rest of us? Offside is offside.... #MOTD
Smart move Wazza lad... #thugforlife

Just to confirm your tee time is 12.00pm (midday). That's 12pm. 

Sincerely, 

Europe
Andrea Faustini is ridiculous. Goosebumps all over the shop when he smashed that tune. Has to be favourite? #XFactor
So many tasty games in that line up as expected. Hope Poults carries his momentum and slots the winning putt #RyderCup2014
It would be lovely if Team Europe could finish the job before 4pm so I can watch Burnley in peace though...
10-6 is commanding but I think EVERY Europe fan will be reticent to get carried away after Medinah. Draw is always interesting #RyderCup2014
Two days, two of the same results. Great afternoon, Dubuisson and the power pair absolutely outstanding. Rose is a bloody legend #GoEurope
Victor Dubuisson is a top man for a Frenchie... #RyderCup2014 <FIRE><FIRE><FIRE>
Sporting theatre at its very, very best. I love Poults #RyderCup2014
WELCOME TO THE RYDER CUP IAN POULTER #RyderCup2014 #gamechager
Mahan &amp; Furyk are ominous. If we can get out of this morning 2-2 that will be a good result now. Big pressure #RyderCup2014
Yet more unbelievable happenings. The top match is playing some of the best golf I've ever seen. @JustinRose99 is a GIANT #RyderCup2014
#Gogglebox back and within the first 10 minutes: "Well I've had some Greek in me" 

Incredible
@rachlaaar the other side of the draw is called foursomes.... Cheeky
Very pleased with the fourballs for tomorrow. Dubuisson's unlucky to miss out but he'll be back #RyderCup2014
@jsalter9 I thank you...
Mickelson looked jaded from the word go this aft. Crazy decision not to play Spieth/Reed again by Watson. Not complaining... #RyderCup2014
@jsalter9 haha definitely picked the best time
@jsalter9 I'm not so sure. They've been dodgy all day together
Rory's putt and Sergio's approach to 18 though... Ridiculous scenes. Is there a better anti-UKIP advert than the Ryder Cup....?
Is that incredible closing run of holes enough to save the power pairing? Rory/Poults worked so well in Medinah... #RyderCup2014
The ebb and flow of this is a nightmare. Incredible scenes. Right now I'd be tempted to drop Sergio in the morning... #RyderCup2014
I hate any American success but seeing Keegan Bradley smile is particularly painful.Big game to lose, Rory &amp; Sergio need to come back strong
Rory and Sergio have to go back out again at 13:45, this could be a pretty rapid lunch.... #RyderCup2014
Game 4 is predictably nip &amp; tuck. Amazing theatre. Huge momentum depends on that outcome #RyderCup2014 #GoEurope
Safe to say it's not gone fully to plan for Poults and Gallacher. Not sure whether we'll see Stevie G this afternoon #RyderCup2014
This is already epic. I'm dreading Sunday as somehow I have to watch Burnley &amp; the finale of the Ryder Cup...
SERGIO! What a bunker shot that is.... #Vamos #Europe #RyderCup2014
@LUCYYJONESS @alandonelan this is not a joking matter Lucy. History could be made. Legends formed. America are the only losers.... ;)
@alandonelan same! Alarm set for the morning, cannot WAIT
@alandonelan WHAT a couple of days that was.... I'M READY LET'S GO EUROPE!
The attraction of a weekend in front of sky sports on the sofa was too much to turn down. GO EUROPE #RyderCup2014
In all seriousness, The Ryder Cup was the main reason. I watched it all on an iPad in France in 2012 &amp; it was the greatest final day EVER
After an enjoyable and successful induction week in Leeds, it's cool I can just nip home for the weekend to see the dog #FamilyComeSecond
Things progressing nicely in Leeds &amp; as of 12 noon today I'll be free til Monday. It's yorkshire day, which could well be my cue to leave...
‚Äú@takethat: Official Statement - 

Oh Jason...
Enjoyably exhausting day. Flat is shaping up to be <OK HAND SIGN> and I got applause for being a postgrad. I think that's a compliment... #old
I am very much enjoying the outbreak of swearing by TV presenters on here. It's just a fucking word for goodness sake. Simmer down people
I know it's been a long day when I go into Twitter and it's been 12 hours since I scrolled...
To say that I have a lot to do at the moment would be a slight understatement. And this is just the intro.... #PostgradCraziness

@jsalter9 @DerrenBrown haha no that was fake. Would have been a little bit illegal. You and Hogey back in Bath?
I also very much enjoy the similarities between @DerrenBrown and @timminchin as entertainers.Both laugh in the face of religion &amp; homeopathy
That finale is just as mind blowing second time round. HOW THE F CAN HE POSSIBLY COME OUT WITH THE PHONE NUMBER. Crazy @DerrenBrown
Love seeing @DerrenBrown on TV after having seen the show. Loved the intro to #Infamous so very much ;)
‚Äú@DerrenBrown: For those in UK, my last stage show 'Infamous' is on C4 at 9 tonight. X‚Äù

Watch, enjoy, be gobsmacked. It was epic
A massive Lancaster Bomber flew over Leeds as I arrived earlier. Either a welcome present or a warning to make sure I come back...
I'm pretty sure going to the freshers fair at the age of 22 is still a legit course of action if it involves many and various free things
Still, the flatmates seem nice and there's an enjoyable international feel to the place. Let's do some translating or summink....
It's like I've travelled back in time to when I was 18, but with all the knowledge and experience of my 22 y/o self. Very, very surreal
Spurs you bunch of arseholes
Unbelievable scenes in Leicester and I'm not even watching!
Crossing the border. Surreal, exciting d√©j√† vu. Let's have a go at Yorkshire eh #Masters #translation #onwards

WILL WE EVER NOT BE LAST ON MOTD?!? #twitterclarets
Sunderland are poor. Definitely down there at the end of the season. I now also love George Boyd #relentless #twitterclarets
No goals obviously worrying. Taking 47 goals out of a team always going to have an effect.Defence as solid as I've ever seen #twitterclarets
Anyone who says that was a dull 0-0 is lying. Good game, finishing was wayward,more than worth a win.We're getting there... #twitterclarets
First &amp; foremost a big un at the Turf. Simply hoping to celebrate a goal. If we do, I think that win'll arrive... #twitterclarets #nervy1-0

@rachlaaar bitch please WE are so wise. This legit response I got yday.... 
@rachlaaar this is where I wish I could RT you... :p
@hectorschector best of luck with no currency, no EU etc.
@hectorschector what does that have to do with anything?! You're saying it doesn't affect Eng/Wales/NI? Very self-centred viewpoint from Sco
2) Obviously it has to be a no for anybody with sense. Would be quite funny to watch the aftermath of a yes though... #indyref
So, Scotland. Only 2 things to say - 1) It's a joke that the rest of the union doesn't get a say in a decision affecting everybody #indyref
Like, I'm not a fresher, but it'll definitely be reminiscent of when I was! Surreal to the very max
Really strange feeling this week in the build up to moving to Leeds. It's like being 18 all over again... #EncoreUneFois
Amazing what a bit of music can do for your mood. I do wish I liked coffee/drugs so I could wake myself up though <TIRED FACE>

Impressed with Boyd, great addition. 4-5-1 with Chalobah in the hole if Ings is out? Hope to god he isn't though... #twitterclarets
Shame for @scottyarf he's been outstanding for every minute of the season so far. Deserved to be the match winner #twitterclarets

If they weren't fairly confident of getting it done, it was silly of Burnley to announce the extension &amp; build false hope really...
Funny thing is we don't know who it is but we're so desperate for it to happen. What if it's Emile Heskey? #twitterclarets #HeskeySigns
Having landed at Leeds/Brad @ 11:30, I didn't expect to get home before the transfer news ended... Could be so anticlimactic #twitterclarets

@jsalter9 @BurnleyOfficial massive name me
If we get one more body in today I'll be pleased. Our options are getting considerably stronger today #twitterclarets
Not long until I have to switch off from #transferdeadlineday until midnight tonight. Flying through the deadline!
Meanwhile, chuffed to bits with @chalobah welcome to Burnley :) #twitterclarets #transferdeadlineday
QPR are a joke club, making a mockery of the so-called FFP rules. Hope to god they go down
‚Äú@bodenknights: A more realistic centre back update - Burnley believe they can still land Keogh from Derby‚Äù

Now then- do it
Anderson? Have you all lost your minds? #twitterclarets #transferdeadlineday
Better late than never definitely sums up this transfer window then... #twitterclarets #TransferDeadlineDay
Chalobah would be a great signing. This random link to Richard Dunne is slightly unnerving like... #desperatetimes #twitterclarets

@lhodgson1988 that's exactly the point of social media such as Twitter- for fans to voice any opinion they want to...
@lhodgson1988 what's the point in anything if you don't look for ways to improve? I'm very happy, I just want to be happier!
Excellent first half and solid at the back, lots to build on. Far more winnable games coming up after the int break #twitterclarets #UTC
Still, how the mighty have fallen eh. We belong in this league #twitterclarets
Yes it's good to have a point, yes we more than held our own. Far too negative on and off the pitch 2nd though #twitterclarets
There for the taking.... #twitterclarets
Also Fletcher is the only recognised CM in that team. Such a strange system, COYC it's there for the taking #twitterclarets #UTC
There it is again, Ashley Young at left back. Kieran Trippier, the stage is yours... #twitterclarets #weaklink
Another one to create crazy feelings at Turf Moor today I imagine. Don't think LVG/Di Maria will enjoy it too much... #twitterclarets
Big day in the Green Bar at @ClubLaSanta tomorrow as the clarets take over. If we win you'll hear the cheers from't Turf #twitterclarets
Yeah, I'm enjoying the holiday &amp; the sun, but by 'eck I cannot WAIT for next week :D <TWO MEN HOLDING HANDS><TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS>
All of the pain. It does mean, however, that my tan's coming along nicely from sitting in the sun doing nothing <THUMBS UP SIGN> #silverlinings
Definitely not dramatic to say that I might have the first case of Ebola on Lanzarote...

@NoNayNeverNet absolute nonsense. The feeling of incredulity and surreality on the Turf last week was epic. Much more of that to come!
It's as cool as it always was here, I've just far outgrown the whole family holiday jazz now. Let's just get a tan and move on eh ;)
Main conclusion of day 2 in Lanzarote is probably don't go running at midday... <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>Ô∏è<DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> #crispyface
‚Äú@NoNayNeverNet: "concentrate on the league" #twitterclarets‚Äù

We've never needed to more, to be fair...
The only crumb of comfort with that is that United's morale will be shattered before the weekend. Poor to not score at home #twitterclarets
Heavy eyelids after a long day, but pleased to be in Lanzarote. Tomorrow brings the start of the chillllllz (maybe a bit of exercise...)
@JamieSmiff exactly, have to consider risk/reward. I can't believe, e.g., 500k more for Dawson is a gigantic risk
@JamieSmiff it's exactly the same as Laws replacing Coyle. Could have paid a bit more for better managers, went for the cheap option
@JamieSmiff worrying that lessons haven't been learned. No need to throw millions at it, surely an extra 1-2 mil can't threaten the future

In my weird mind, this week at @ClubLaSanta is basically a boot camp to spark proper training for my 1:59:59 time in the @bathhalf 2015
A week in the sun then. Either a relaxing, rejuvenating break, or a difficult, grating one. Probably no grey area there...
Di Maria, finally a star signing for United. Big debut on the cards at t'Turf #twitterclarets
Biggest glaring difference atm is how much quicker/more incisive other teams are. Surely need more ball players in midfield? #twitterclarets
#twitterclarets deserved a point yday, taking chances is everything in this league, Juke must have had nightmares about that header...

Well well... Van Gaal may be a tactical genius, but anyone who plays Ashley Young at left back ON PURPOSE doesn't get my kudos from me...

Beautiful cross by @Mee_36 shame that Lee Mason and some stewards are trying to spoil the atmos a bit... #NoNeed #claretsLIVE
Lovely goal, hope this tendency to only switch it on after conceding isn't something regular... #twitterclarets
This lot are outstanding. Like a tribal warcry above our heads... #claretsLIVE 
Serious legend this one... #Toni #twitterclarets 
Both teams good until the box first half, HV are a handy side. Just watching Toni and the away fans for most of it tbh... #twitterclarets
Pretty much a straight choice between Kightly &amp; Taylor for one spot. Taylor looked good Tuesday, big chance today #twitterclarets
Something tells me @IngsDanny is quite excited to get back on't hallowed Turf today. Let's finish pre-season with a goal :) #twitterclarets
Big names at TM tomorrow in the shape of Luca Toni and Rafael Marquez. Suppose we'd better get used to being starstruck <THUMBS UP SIGN><SOCCER BALL>Ô∏è #twitterclarets
Inbetweeners 2, top effort. Laughed as hard, if not harder, than during the first film #TheFirstTimeEverISawYourFace
IF (capitals) we get Chalobah and Lansbury, that massively improves the depth of our midfield options. Promising #twitterclarets
Oh and a little bit of VIP action at the Turf tomorrow. Would only ever accept the invitation for a friendly though... #PrawnSandwichBrigade
Another standard week of summer. Work with a slither of play. Ready to switch off for't weekend, starting with Inbetweeners &amp; @Tiff_Robin :D
Mildly successful day on the course yesterday. Actually not bad at that game... #HowOldAreYouRyan #Pensioner #TooMuchGolf #ExceptNot
Got back in from the first 9 holes and seen the cricket score?! Love it #England
Very glad of a day off tomorrow to concentrate on hitting various little white balls round various fields. I mean, I say 'concentrate'...
His goal at Bournemouth was massive for us last season. 
Hope Barnsley do wel‚Ä¶
Care far too much.
Claire's well and truly fucked this up #GBBO #CantPolish
Ok so I presume there's some kind of group vomit session at the end of the programme? Ridiculous amounts of cake #GBBO
I've never watched #GBBO before. I'm giving it one episode to hook me. Loving the innuendos already #LikesItTighter
You know you've hit the big time when EA sports make your stadium on FIFA. Outstanding scenes #twitterclarets
No idea. Absolutely no clue whatsoever. Brain's on absolute overdrive today too...
Good run out against a good footballing side. Juke is Vokes mark 2 if he gets fitter, Taylor looked handy. Solid #twitterclarets
The guys with hundreds of half and half scarves for tonight were pretty ambitious weren't they? Come back in 2 weeks... #twitterclarets
Celta far better second half, nice goal, incisive. Great response, good work by Barnes, good that he finally got in the game #twitterclarets
@BPeacockBFC haha tongue in cheek really. Pies are ¬£2.50 now which I think is an increase? Didn't get a chance to check beer
It's all fine by the way, with the price hikes on the food&amp;drink, we'll be able to afford Dawson &amp; Deeney by next week ;) #twitterclarets
Noticeable lack of advertising boards yet. I imagine they'll pack them in before Chelsea! #twitterclarets
All kicking off. They're certainly.... passionate this lot. #SpanishFlair #YeahRight #twitterclarets 
As expected, #twitterclarets very impressive without the ball so far. Great energy. Juke looks promising. Celta offering little...
Beaut of a pass from Wallace! Everyone's panicking about Ingsy, obviously.... #twitterclarets
Great to be home. Bit of Bob Lord action this eve, and 1-0 already thanks to the Juke :D #defooffside #twitterclarets 
Today's dilemma. Do I sign up for the Bath Half again a) so I can visit in March, b) to halt the alarming return to poor fitness...
This incident show's exactly why Twitter is the newsfeed of the future. Mass media has changed forever #InstantUpdates #ManchesterAirport
Back to't Turf tonight for the first time since the jubilant scenes in May. Will be interesting to see the many changes #twitterclarets
Ecclestone to pay ¬£80m to settle his bribery case. Sounds a lot like bribery to pay for bribery if you ask me... #Dodgy
@_jxmes well yeah that goes without saying, but the footage from years ago was a very strange choice
‚Äú@PhilBirdBFC: For clarification. The Burnley/Port Vale footage used in the ESPN preview is from January 2011.‚Äù

This was the weirdest part!
‚Äú@Earth_Pics: Times Square ~ New York 

Take me back...
Whatever you do, say, see, hear, feel. You owe it to those who, 100 years ago, we're prepared to fight, and to die. We will remember them
The choir singing in German is a nice touch. My whole life is based on the post-wars reconciliation. We owe them everything #WW1centenary
#LightsOut #lestweforget 
Don't often consider this, but imagine this time 100 years ago. What on earth must that have felt like... #WW1centenary #WeWillRememberThem
#lestweforget #LightsOut
SO MUCH SHOUTING #Corrie #Deirdre
Deirdre you selfish cow, he didn't choose to leave. Have you not watched the news this year? #ProdigalKen #Corrie
Nice calm episode for William Roache to return to then... #howcouldyouNOTTELLME #LOUDNOISES #Corrie
2 years since #SuperSaturday and 100 years since the start of the Great War. Contrasting emotional histories for August 4th...
‚Äú@bodenknights: This video is the sort of condescending bollocks Burnley will use as fuel this season. Muppets 

Wow.
@SkyBetFL @SkyBet Wade Elliott! Absolute legend! #SkyBetTransferFund
That article about slacking off at work is definitely a massive self fulfilling prophecy on a Monday. Bet thousands have done just that...
It's just the start of 4 years of centenary reflection I suppose. Such sacrifice... #WW1centenary
The lights-out remembrance tonight is a poignant idea. I fear there won't be mass participation, though #WW1centenary
So 3 weeks til my holiday, 4 weeks to various fun times, 7 weeks until I move to Leeds. Anyone for a bit of #onwards action?
Today can do one. I have no time for you Monday
So bloody tired. No sign of a lie in on the horizon. Bloody lovely. Over these random hurdles and round the obstacles, it's time to #onwards
IS IT NEW YEAR? WHAT HAPPENED TO SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER? WHAT IS THIS WIZARDRY? #TimeTravel #AuldLangSyne #ClosingCeremony
God this is the cheesiest things I've ever seen. Where's Kylie?! #GoldCoast #ClosingCeremony
Ok so I want to go to the Gold Coast... #TourismAdvert #ClosingCeremony
Pleasant but windy morning on the course with caddy @GBury_17 somehow staying awake for the whole 18 holes #UpAllNight #TopLad #LolJK #Chump
In some kind of self torture exercise, I'm getting up at 7 on a Sunday to play golf. I only foresee positivity... #grouchy #MindGames
#Lampard to City, what a move! One of the best players I've ever watched, love Frank, he can only improve their squad
Pretty sure Tom could do a bomb for his final dive and still win this. Absolutely love it #Gold #TeamEngland
Epic relay! Why would anyone ever not lean at the line?!? #TeamEngland #Gold
Chilled Saturday in front of the Commonwealths. Jo Pavey was an absolute warrior, now got everything crossed for @TomDaley1994 #TeamEngland
‚Äú@GBury_17: Parents and brother discussing university shit so decided to leave the room‚Äù

We really missed his input too. Such a shame... <SMIRKING FACE>
Really interesting conclusions about selflessness too. It's good while it lasts. Which is never very fucking long <OK HAND SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><PACKAGE>
In other news... You know when people are sometimes in two minds about things. Yeah, I'm in about seven minds atm <THUMBS UP SIGN><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><SLEEPING SYMBOL>
Tonight's the kind of night which highlights just how interesting hindsight it. Feel pretty good about that too
@CharlotteRosie4 I know right! It depresses that what he's saying is so similar to my own outlook...
ffs I hate agreeing with Joey Barton so much. But on this one, I can't argue. Bloody religion...

Thank you for making our world magical 
These #Potter rumours though... I believe absolutely none of it, but could you actually imagine?! I'd be fucking beside myself with joy...
Have to take the rough with the smooth on social media. @BurnleyOfficial have just had more rough days lately... #awkward #askingforit
Turf's definitely going to look different this season, few snazzy touches being added. Thankfully it'll remain a shed ;) #twitterclarets
I've either strained my neck muscles (along with every other one in my body) or I have a massive illness coming on. Pain, whatever. #strugs
Good to tie down @Mee_36 to a new deal, an absolute warrior of a man and improving all the time :D #twitterclarets
Happy 32nd to @jimmy9 solid 5fer on the day! Onwarrrrrrds :)))
Life... <CONFUSED FACE><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Not 100% sure, but fairly certain I won't be able to get out of bed in the morning... #JellyLegs
@AbelGiddins @NoNayNeverNet sounded good!
@AbelGiddins @NoNayNeverNet ;)
Ahhh there we go, there's something resembling our proper team (minus Heaton/Kightly I suppose) #twitterclarets #superior
@JamesHoust11 I love it, we thrive as underdogs as we showed last year!
I remember when PNE away was a huge fixture on the calendar. Now look, it's a pre-season friendly. How things change... #twitterclarets
The prediction mill is well and truly up and running now. 99.9% saying we're going down. Standard! #CarryOn #HappyUnderdogs #twitterclarets
Does #Remy failing a medical make way for @LFC interest in Jay Rod? Good for #twitterclarets if so #SellOnClause #SouthamptonIsEmpty
David Gower basically just calling all social media users "lunatics" and "numpties". What an absolute arse #Patronising @SkyCricket
Timehop's hilarious today. Opening ceremony 2 years ago, Dusseldorf 3 years ago. Fantastic day in history...
So little sleep, in an armchair, is not a great recipe for a productive day...
Last night escalated rather quickly. Enjoyable times!
Risk regretting what you do, not what you don't.... #Manchester #AveIt
Depending on what happens, these weird tweets are going to look either funny or very sad on Timehop in the future... #babblingon
Further clarity brings further complication, I suppose. The mist is clearing though... #EyesWideShut
The Drog returns! I really hope he doesn't spoil his legacy, but Arsenal fans beware....
@mrdanwalker fab ice lollies and a chocolate orange. Big sugar rush
Trust #Corrie to cheer me up... "Michael, Gail tells me you've been working wonders on her front garden"

Audrey you absolute bantersaurus
Think I'd better start rebuilding that metaphorical wall now. Will need strong fortifications by September at this rate... #BrainsAreStupid
@Elrubik @campbellclaret true, my phone went mental...
On a very small scale, how a retweet from @campbellclaret can rather swell the exposure of one's tweets... #boom 
Hahahaha Liz taking the royal piss out of Imran there. Lad #Glasgow2014 #openingceremony
‚Äú@kenty227: @ClaretRaz @campbellclaret So quiet it shouted out loud to those responsible‚Äù

Very poignant
There really is nothing quieter than a full stadium during a respectful minute's silence. Well observed #openingceremony #Glasgow2014
That was all very Eurovision... #WelcomeEUROPE #WhereIsConchita #openingceremony #Glasgow2014
The dogs are a great touch. The Aussies are out of their minds. Great parade though, well choreographed #openingceremony
I hope the Queen's message is some kind of Dynamo-style prediction for what's happened in the last 280 days #magic #openingceremony #baton
500 miles! This ceremony is obviously not on the same level as London but it couldn't BE more Scottish #openingceremony
Just 40,000+ people singing for you Liz. She bloody loves it #openingceremony
Of the 71 commonwealth countries, how many can't understand a word of this? #openingceremony #CommonwealthGames #atleast65
Love an opening ceremony. Think they've peaked too soon with Barrowman though! #CommonwealthGames #openingceremony
@ben_hogan91 who's your alternative?
First evidence I'm forgetting the Championship exists already: had no clue Lafferty had signed for Norwich #twitterclarets #premierleague
7 years ago at this point I was about halfway through a 48-hour reading marathon thanks to JK Rowling. Best 2 days ever #DeathlyHallows
The human brain.A masterpiece in science and evolution, capable of infinite things. All, it seems, except MAKING SENSE OF LIFE #BlurredLines
Sending much kudos and love to @rachlaaar as she sets off on her African adventure. Have an amazing time but do come back... ;)
‚Äú@BurnleyOfficial: Half time: BURNLEY 3 GROSSKLEIN 0‚Äù

WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE PEOPLE #twitterclarets
Little BRGS reunion was cool though, interesting to see how little people really change :)
Lovely evening in Sheffield, spent mostly catching up ALOT of things with @cataxon :))
Re: contract. no brainer- if we get less money for him next summer for a year more of his goals, it's a price worth paying! #twitterclarets
Good interview with @IngsDanny on @ClaretsPlayer I don't think I've ever seen a more genuine footballer. Top lad
So, 5 hours sleep then 27 holes of golf with a group of mainly twattish people. Patience truly is a virtue #keepcalmandcarryon
Life's got a funny way of complicating itself when you least expect it hasn't it. Brains are ridiculous things... #verwirrend
Positive day all round really. Except for the dog, who's currently rocking the cone of shame and absolutely not enjoying it... Error
The @BurnleyOfficial away kit's pretty cool. I'm sure as soon as we win a game in it the haters will pipe down... #twitterclarets
These rumblings about Jimmy smell ALOT like bullshit to me. Cheating Indians....
The Clarets are in Austria. God I wish I had the money to just nip over and visit... #Gru√üGottBurnley
@Robynf_ nope, she's an absolute knob
Chuffed that the United game is on TV too, fingers crossed that @ClubLaSantaUK have BT sport somewhere! <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Monday night football at the Turf. Return to the PL under the lights! SHIT JUST GOT REAL #twitterclarets #WeArePremierLeague
After all that, the brilliant tournament and the epic footie that came with it, chuffed that the best team won. Deutschland vor... #GER
Jimmy! Just got in and seen the scorecard, absolutely love it. Never have a better chance for 100 mate....
Oh well, nice to see some devastated Dutchmen either way. Probably best two sides in the final, can't see past Deutschland though #GER #ARG
The Germans will be absolutely loving this. Whatever happens, that trophy must be heading back to the Vaterland?
Imagine the pressure on this... Hope Holland win so I can watch them get demolished in the final
Just sitting, thinking of ghosts of the past, and thinking I haven't done too badly so far on my post-BRGS journey #BestSchoolEver
Back at BRGS for the evening with various kids about the start their uni career. Very, very old...
Thanks to Timehop, it's not possible to get the holiday blues 1 year on.... #NYC #TakeMeBack
Soap operas are not only created fiction, but also a reflection of real society. Tonight's @bbceastenders was therefore bloody top notch :)
Hardly any words for what happened in Brazil tonight. Chuffed for Klose, absolute legend. Germany MUST win this tournament #VorsprungDurch..
Just seen the score. DEUTSCHLAND VOR! #MADNESS #VERRUCKT #GER #BRA
Truly distressed that I can't act like a student any more. Getting discouraging looks as I wander around the north in flip flops... #BOV
@rachlaaar haha I saw it and had to mention you.... Shhhhhhhh
‚Äú@faktastisch: Beziehungen, die in den Fr√ºhlings- und Sommermonaten entstehen, halten l√§nger.‚Äù

@rachlaaar ;)
Eugh. That's how I feel about being at home and not in Bath right now
Changing my location on social media is just another sad step in this week of crapness
Ah for god's sake, whenever anyone puts more photos of graduation up on fb it's going to bring more sadness
Back in the motherland. Burnley doesn't change much over time does it... Meanwhile, so much comfort eating on the train = food coma
Ah the north. Not gonna lie, not exactly thrilled to see you, but I'd better get used to you again pretty damn sharpish... #repatriation
Tearing myself away is so relevant, with both pronunciations of the word tearing...
Absolute emptiness. Once upon a time, this would have been the journey back home. Bath's got so far under my skin I don't know any more
First time for weeks I've had to get my headphones out and walk somewhere alone. It's been far too fun to summarise. Don't want to go...
