love ? 

its when you prioritize the persons feelings rather than yours.

its not all about of what you only feel or fulfilling your desires
let me tell you something you never expected 

lets see if you could handle it

Everytime I see your name, every pain you caused me. I still have it inside. How will I ever stop this.

That little hope I had, was a mistake. :(
Mistakes are the stepping stones to wisdom, we learn from trial &amp; error, we become wise by understanding problems.
I admit, I really miss how things used to be. But I also admit, that I've accepted the fact that things changed. ^zudee015^

Mentally: I'm drained. 

Spiritually: I feel dead. 

Physically: I smile.
Lessons in life will be repeated until they are learned.

Maybe because you weren’t ready before.
NW : G2B haha honestly nakikinuod lng. Wla kong alam sa nangyayari.,
Love is also "decision". Not just a feeling.
The key to succeeding in a relationship is not finding the right person; it's learning to love the person you found.
You said you'll never be that guy, but what happened now, youre worst than him
Love doesn't hurt. It's the rejection, the false love, the boredom, the break-ups, the cheating, and the jealousy that hurts.
“In the beginning you will fall into the gaps in between thoughts – after practicing for years, you become the gap.”
-I like you
-I'm talking to 2 other girls 
-but I still like you
-trust me
I still feel the same way as i did when you left . :(
There is no such thing called as "true love"
Sometimes bad things happen, and there's nothing you can do about it, so why worry ?- but what if its one after the other ? #itsjusttoomuch
When you give up, it means you never really wanted it.
i still feel the pain. Same feeling i had those days. :( #sakitmeyn

@Realsyazwanendo haha uhm consider it "Just checking on you" :)) lolz
Should i still consider regretting when it comes to decision making?
Hardest part of life is choosing which one to let go and which one to keep in ur life
i don't mean to hurt anyone. I'm just really confused :/
i dont mean any of this to happen. but i know its my mistake for not deciding which is right or wrong
am i really bad for what happened. :/
"Looks" isnt a thing when it comes to love. :)
i'm still confused -_-
@Realsyazwanendo one word. "FIERCE" &gt;:)
The more anger you hold in your heart towards the past, the less capable you are of loving the present.
Honestly, I hate some of your friends.
If you love someone, be sure to hold them close. If you don’t, someone else will.
Do what you did in the beginning of the relationship and there won’t be an end. — Anthony Robbins
Sometimes the bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on the path to the best things that will ever happen to us.
Me, I’m dishonest, and you can always trust a dishonest man to be dishonest. Honestly, it’s the honest ones you have to watch out for.
I’m telling the truth, but then I smile, and then they think I’m lying.
Hurt me with the truth, but never comfort me with a lie.
It seems like every time you come up something happens to bring you back down. — Tupac Shakur
Distance does not ruin people’s relationships; you don’t have to see someone every day to stay in love.
Let distance be another reason to love harder than any couple should.
Distance sometimes lets you know who’s worth keeping and who’s worth letting go.
