@joy_feng so much for a timely reminder
@joy_feng you have a title to defend
@vincgc maybe but he can't shoot at the 2 and will struggle off the ball there and probably can't defend in the post also
@vincgc isn't Rubio a good defender? His long arms and I rmb he got 2nd highest steals or something. Rubio can be a star if he can score IMO
@vincgc but the Rubio passes for the highlight dunks...
@CH_KuroShiro @kiasuwhite still got rain right?

@luciennder haha coz instead of getting burned for the spicy and sour the nice way, the ulcer stings and it is not nice at all
Keep accidently falling asleep... Gotta concentrate
@luciennder and for the wrong reasons
@luciennder I am in pain everytime I eat spicy food
@luciennder they're just painful useless nonsense that prevent you from eating nice food

Per: "Give me a week..." 
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy if he signs with bulls the Ecf won't look so tanky anymore. But that means heat and Knicks gone for the season Liao
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy hard to see either plumlee brothers leaving. Asik would've been nice lol.
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy they just need to find a decent defensive centre from somewhere somehow.
@bradleyyyboy @vincgc Houston have bosh now. And if the cavs keep wiggins theyll have a 2nd lockdown defender to take some burden off James
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy true but that's messing with the roster again which is sorta why Lebron left in the 1st place
@bradleyyyboy @vincgc and you lose a lot of the perimeter protection and backcourt young talent when you trade them
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy gonna take more than just wiggins for love
@bradleyyyboy @vincgc waiters Bennett and Thompson are all shooters right?
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy only have varejao left right? Thompson can play there if they go small I suppose
Freak I meant bosh goes to rockets.
If melo goes to Chicago, bulls and cavs automatically become contenders at heats expense?
@vincgc @bradleyyyboy yea but the amount of self picked lottery talent is insane. Not to mentioned they also traded zeller, another lottery
That means bosh to rockets. Heat have nothing. Lin to 76ers. Parsons stays. Still not sure where Hayward goes though
@bradleyyyboy can they play Bennett there and go small? Coz waiters is a no 4. forgot what Thompson was although he can play the 5
Going back to Cleveland? Doesn't that just switch the haters from Cleveland to Miami?
@bradleyyyboy and a number 4 pick at the final spot
Ultimately the debate is always between conservatism and chasing your dreams
Shld probably figure out what to do with my life soon

@Ket_an sleep occurs during the day. The night is for World Cup
@vincgc haha ya just learning all the stuff no need to memorize and stuff
@Ket_an thanks ily
@vincgc think you're describing every subject
Suddenly can't physics at all so dead tomorrow
@thelonelyviet more like whole physics syllabus
@joy_feng mock
K just got owned by physics. This is not a good time. Not to mention I have an econs paper to salvage
Never felt time pass so fast in my life those math and bnm papers were crazy.
@Ket_an ya haha I was like ok double check what I wrote. Ok wait forget it
@Ket_an more of random scribbly drawings than handwriting
I think after the next 2 days my brain will be sufficiently trashed to i think transformers 4 is a good when I watch it, sooner or later
Sigh just dead
Lallana to Liverpool for €30m

Shaw to Utd. for €27m 
Aurier is available for €8m

Problem with Eng…
Should've done mathhhhh
@Ket_an @vincgc @ArunVignesh9 lol mine both also hl la haha confirm die liao
@Ket_an @ArunVignesh9 @vincgc da hell? Vincent g topping bnm la. I dyed already bnm and math hl tomorrow both cmi
Just so sian
Just screwing up everything
Should really be studying now. But instead watching Korean drama with my mum
@Karthik21396 @kiasuwhite well not us. But itll be like Sujith Kumaarr president of organic whey with bodybuilders as farmers haha
@Karthik21396 and hire bodybuilder s
@kiasuwhite true that. Ok we see how. Maybe Thursday haha
@Karthik21396 no must help the community. You farm the organic stuff to make protein shakes. Not that chemical stuff
@kiasuwhite you wanna ball on Friday?
@Karthik21396 so farmer Sujith in the future? Shld do this as your sir idea haha
@Karthik21396 coz they use machines now
@Karthik21396 @TipsForYouDaily ya go be farmer
@Karthik21396 RT @TipsForYouDaily: Gym replacement 
Why am I so sleepy after only 1 paper
@kiasuwhite lol you watching now?
@xtremecoolz and ppl always like the same ones so it repeats somemore lol
@xtremecoolz haha gets quite distracting sometimes
So so so careless for math
Freak now Needa find intellectual books to memorize if wanna go uk at all lol
@vincgc -.- copy my idea then lose originality points haha
@vincgc haha I got desperate, no cca or other stuff that I could link so just went for nba
@vincgc Lolol I was linking my course of interest (math business and stats) to my passions haha
@limcutjeans nba spurs can haha. Bpl spurs uhh hopefully we can engage in intellectual debate Abt both team lololol
@guppyforcee lol say and try only la. Coz I'm citing them as my passions then linking them to math and stats and finance
So my ucas personal statement is Abt nba and arsenal. Better hope the Oxford guy at least likes 1 of the 2
@shuttleloo wa wa why so rage
@Karthik21396 @Ket_an wth you guys talking abt
@ArunVignesh9 @vincgc lol the reason the heat chose him. I Dono le I think chalmers and cole just had a bad streak at the wrong time
@vincgc spurs always get the perfect pick. Surprised he actually fell to 30 though, thought he'll be like 23-24. Who's this Shabazz guy?
@vincgc yea but it also means they see oladipo and exum as 2s instead of 1s. Exum isn't known for his shooting either. Gordon gives spacing
@vincgc probably means the end of Nicholson also. Oladipo and exum backcourt would have be crazy athletic and super defence
@vincgc they're probably going for proven players over huge unknowns
At the end of it all, the spurs still drafted best with Diaw v2
@bradleyyyboy isn't Noel more of a power forward?
An adult that does the same is…
Math
@stanlee_woo which part la
@stanlee_woo where are you
Good choice for Argentina
Hmm France or Argentina...
@limcutjeans + wee Keong
@Ket_an wa thanks for telling the truth
@Ket_an just coz you sure 7 already go out play soccer
John Chiew brain fried by bio. My brain fried by physics
Wa sad why Prandelli or however you spell his name leaving
All this commotion going on and Lebron opts out. Trying to disguise it eh
@Karthik21396 you can stop now master
@Karthik21396 haha ya if Uruguay were actually the better team fair enough but to go out like that..Just sad. stop calling me master master
Italy didn't deserve to go out like that

@RandallHan giroud has one of the highest conversion rates dude, balotelli has the lowest haha
@RandallHan haha the 1st one mainly. The 2nd one he should've dribbled but i think he was angry at the 1st miss
@RandallHan don really wanna see him at arsenal after that miss
Needa learn the art of shamelessness and just ask the guy at the counter lol
Must add fail mid year RT @The2014WorIdCup: The never ending cycle! 
Gotta stop gambling on bus timings lol
Should've slept and watched Brazil instead
Gotta stop making quick decisions
@limcutjeans yea I looking at them it'll be interesting

@rednada_0310 haha yup yup
Too fat to do anything
@Ket_an haha ditch me alone for so long
Quite sure meet at 9 means you reach school at 9 not wake up And leave the hse at 9
@RandallHan for you impossible
Only by working together as a part of a team, can a raindrop become part of a flood - the bs world champions use to win bnm competitions
Have to keep changing seat even when sitting on the floor because it's just so hotttt
Ok really gotta work this blob of fat into shape

I think the gods are crying tears of joy for arsenal winning
@Ket_an lit 7 here I come

@Ket_an @om_nommmm well watch champions league next season
@om_nommmm @Ket_an I think you mean seventeenth heaven
@Ket_an now 7th and below
@Ket_an win or lose can always expect something interesting in an arsenal game. Manu is lose or lose, it'll still be boring

@bradleyyyboy looks like all bnm students have that mission today

*Arsenal win ugly*

"Arsenal won't win anything playing like that"
Fabianski is too good for 2nd choice but he has to ours forever
That was the most intense few hours of my life. Let's see whether ib finals and eetokia can match it
And I had to wake up early to tank work tomorrow...
@aaronheng that was the warm up
@aaronheng he tried
Perfectly in the joint of the post. How much more unlucky can you get
Chuba eisfield kallstrom come on anyone
Come on arsenal I don wanna see a penalty shoot out
@aaronheng Ramsey ox or Sanogo solo dribble
@aaronheng haha alright. Anything as long as we win for me
@aaronheng it's madness
Not good to support arsenal if you have a heart condition
Sigh...
In desperate need of sleep
@kiasuwhite nope just mega share
@kiasuwhite agents? I try. It was predictable until the recent episodes which are kinda extreme. The link with marvel movies is cool though
Too bad when I work at my work list I cried
Wow the recent agents of shield episodes make me wanna watch captain America even more.
Just got attacked by some huge black thing. Hopefully it isn't poisonous
So much work but absolutely 0 motivation

Benteke missed a free hat trick
Ding dong ping pong pinball football

Getting more and more confused at life as the days go by. Work ain't doing much to help either. In fact it needs help lol I'm a goner
Tonight's work is completed thanks to the sugar in dark chocolate
Keeping myself awake on chocolate now

@stanlee_woo this is getting worse than the mountain
@stanlee_woo haha haha ha
@Ket_an that's why don't bother following him
@Ket_an haha sorry. But you did it 1st and your case was worse. One was the pitch the other wasn't
@Ket_an doesn't affect the scoreline. Just poor start and opponents got their tactics right
