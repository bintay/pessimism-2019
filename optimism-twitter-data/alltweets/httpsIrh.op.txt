bye i'm changing my name to Japan bc 5sos love Japan, therefore they will love me
i think that the only thing luke said in the japan tour video diary was "JAPAN!!"
ashton was so offended because calum said "that's why i don't really like ashton" and not just "that's why i don't like ashton"
"no i'm not dating taylor swift"
"huh?"
"no i'm not dating taylor swift"
"i never asked you that"
