@muditha interesting. YOu are building up the suspense right?
Isn't that the same country which destroyed so many acres of mangrove to build a highway just 1.5 years ago? 
Excellent move Mr. President. Can you start with the important marshes around the Central Environmental Authority 
@ravimendis haw time to start using the old boy network then
@BuduMalli I used to do that all the time before Jan 2015
@BuduMalli bloody hell! Hope it works out @udaraumd @TheCitizen1
@udaraumd ah oh! that means we are back to the bad old days @BuduMalli @TheCitizen1
@BuduMalli @TheCitizen1 feel awfully bad for the tweep, at the same time fact checking is sorely needed on the LK social media scene
@AyeshaShehani one of them is a Bishopian :-)
@sansunman I am usually someone who struggles to put together even  a blog post but let's see @mhmhisham
#lka has serious good scrabble prodigies. Prolly better than this lot but not a word about them even in SL papers 
@nMeeDiN @mhmhisham I am still not happy, the govt is trying to convict people for their least serious crime instead of most serious one
@0Harsh0 I don't think they have but for any merc you can order a part and get it down. Ranjith estimated 120K plus!
හොරුත් එක්ක ඩීල් දාපු උන් හොරු බලන්න හිර ගෙට යනවා. #lka
@0Harsh0 also replaced some diagram in the pump can't remember how much that cost. Pretty soon all going to add up to the price of new one
@0Harsh0 Yeah got it serviced at DIMO (20k) they are the agents. Got nozzles replaced about 16k. Apprently the fault is in the governor.
@0Harsh0 nopes 200D and there is a problem with the diesel pump so pulling power is slightly reduced and a bit smoky @udithaumesh
@KolithaBee you appended build to  @TheCitizen1 screen name :-)
@0Harsh0 probably about right but I haven't been on the haputale climb in years and years. and mine defintely wont make it :-) @udithaumesh
@TheCitizen1 just X5 :-) @KolithaBee @kazZtr_
@TheCitizen1 that's what I thought. It's probably cheaper to buy a house than build one these days @KolithaBee @kazZtr_
@TheCitizen1 you can build a house for that much these days? @KolithaBee @kazZtr_
@kazZtr_ in my book the bhp figure is to cars what mega pixel is to cameras.  @KolithaBee
@udithaumesh that car is all about comfort not about driving pleasure, but i've been told that 300D is pretty quick though @0Harsh0
@kazZtr_ aiyo just as soon as I come into the room you leave @KolithaBee
@KolithaBee why this morning also you sent a traffic alert :-) @kazZtr_
@KolithaBee but why? driving fast doesn't cause where and tear except for breaks and tyres @kazZtr_
@KolithaBee heck it hasn't been shifted into 5th gear for at least 2 years. @kazZtr_
@KolithaBee getting back to high speed my car can accelerate rapidly even at 120km/h but when and where do we get such chances? @kazZtr_
@KolithaBee very worth saves a fews minutes every day and time is money @kazZtr_
@binku precisely my dear sir, even if the radio doesn't work and the fuel pumps needs to be replaced ASAP.
@KolithaBee nah there is a world of difference. I have driven an 800 and I happen to have a slow car and a very fast car @kazZtr_
@DEEisaliveee sorry for late reply tell him that people who watch too much TV are more likely to get Alzheimer's
@KolithaBee the real benefit of a fast small car is when you are in moderate traffic. I also agree that top speed is useless @kazZtr_
@rahulrrao She is not on twitter yet?
@DEEisaliveee unplug the TV
@muditha and immediate dissolution @PresidentGovLK
The Galle face green is about 800m in length but it's width as you know is much much narrower. so 600k for papal visit is a bit of a stretch
Please note that you can safely pack only 5 people per m2. 
@rangaba @udendra for a moment I read it like Galabada atthe
@Miyuruhansi අර බැල්කනියේ ඉඳන් ට්‍රුම්පෙට් ගැහුවද?
Gonna be a landmark legal case. What has higher precedence freedom of expression or the flag? 
@TheCitizen1 when did we ever really get together for anything in lk?
Hopefully there will be a placard or two against the destruction of the Battaramulla bird sanctuary too. 
Tomorrow starts at 8 30 at parliament grounds. 
May 16th…
@BuduMalli let's not look into that for now, let's utilize their numbers also to get it stopped, then lets talk about it
@Pamiya89 I am hopeful but not optimistic but if nothing else awareness about environmental issue has skyrocketed over past 10 days
Stopping the project isn't enough, the culprits must be brought to justice. 
@TheCitizen1 MR :) @RW_UNP @PresidentGovLK
Sadly it was hijacked by racists but, everyone must come together to save all forests including Wilpattu 
Concerned about Wilpattu? Worse has been happening in the forest reserves around Nuwara Eliya for decades. Please talk about it too.
@AyeshaShehani the last lecture of the day is never worth getting stuck in the rush hour traffic.
Why do people have to bring in racism to saving a wild life park? Haven't they seen the number of Muslims condemning Min. Badurdeen?
Yes, the destruction was started in 2009 when we were powerless to speak out against it. 
@binku yes I know of that theory, during the early seventies the economy was roaring according to Sirima and collapsed says JR @malinthe
@malinthe ration probably explains why hemlines were far shorter those days than they are now :-)
@malinthe very! during 70-77 you only got a very small cloth ration per year it seems. Milk, sugar, rice all were rationed
@malinthe that I think might have been during the depression but I've heard people made trousers from plain sacks in early 70s in SL
I could have sworn it was 
yum install repmgr
the last time I tried it and that's  what I put into the setup script. Seems it's repmgr93
@AyeshaShehani මටත් ඕක තමි වුනේ
@AyeshaShehani athsanayake method works. (he even got back into parliament)
@AyeshaShehani the universe is trying to tell you that you shouldn't attend lectures
The destruction of Wilpattu was begun in 2009 
@zenrainman and it's dry now? severe drought or ground water tables dropped?
@zenrainman how deep is that well?
When will @PresidentGovLK take action. 
Did the supreme court give one single ruling in favour of an opposition mp in the past 5 years? 
@Musathik changed jobs? all the best
@zenrainman typical of Sri Lankans actually. Vesak is celebrated by cutting down thousands of areca nut trees to build pandals
Buddha was the first environmentalist and vesak is hardly over but someone is cutting down a tree near by.
@sanjiva thank you for the entertainment @gnudeep
@ShammasGhouse Wigneshwaran was in my good books also until January but he suddenly changed his stripes. Needs to satisfy hardline voters?
@ShammasGhouse then there was the letter to the indian PM and plenty of extremist comments. Sumanthiran and Sampanthan are good blokes.
@ShammasGhouse remember that resolution in the northern provincial council that almost scuttle the security council postponement?
I have no problem with Kerry talking to the TNA. But wigneshwaran? come on!
@BuduMalli soon as you get your next promotion will you find out and let us know? @SueKiri
Oh sorry my previous tweet is in error. Kerry doesn't have medals, he threw them over the Capital hill fence in protest over the war.
While Sri Lankan politicans claim to have won the war without ever going into battle. Secretary of state Kerry has a chestful of medals.
@SueKiri maybe @budumalli will be able to tell us
@SueKiri yes but they are also in charge of security at embassies so I was wondering if they covered Kerry.
So who handled security for Kerry? the PSD of the water bottle fame or the SS?
@KolithaBee must have been someone else.  I remember seeing someone with the same dp a while back.
@KolithaBee what's with the d/p? didn't you have that same DP a long time back?
Vesak, the day on which money extorted from households by local hooligans will be used to offer dansals to force feed those who donated.
@SriLankaTelecom why only what? What is the logic?
@arvindjkv perfectly describes  60% of my Uni friends and 80% of my school friends
@muditha @Spooky_Flyer93 they should have built a second terminal + runway instead of a whole new airport
@rangaba දැන් චීන බාසාව  ඕනේ නැනේ?
@drac that sounds like the name of a famous bond trader @sharond_s
@TheCitizen1 thanks for wading it, as you often say, very few people understand the religion they proudly boast of belonging to :-)
@lahirunirmala I don't like firefox anymore. @kiriappeee Remember the time when the IDE was the biggest memory+cpu hog on our machines?
Why the hell does the gmail tab need bloody 600MB? tempted to switch back to good old Thunderbird. (yes, my computer is aging)
@seniinthebox Ah yes, I remember your mentioning the automatic part.
@kiriappeee sorry meant to say @thameera's suggestion
@kiriappeee 's suggestion is a very good one, I recall using it once for a very tricky conversion.
@SueKiri with the top right being the closest?
@ahamednishadh @mhmhisham how the mighty have fallen
@seniinthebox goodie make and model?
@seniinthebox they heard that you sold the car and have extra cash at hand :-)
Is it just me or is route53 DNS awfully slow?
@trappedalien WTH is that?
Hah! RW has retweeted someone. Now I have seen everything.
@KanagaGopi your tweet was of course to create an uncle target
@KanagaGopi Uncle Target was defined in that book as the target that everyone shoots at.
@KanagaGopi you ever read Uncle Target?
@malinthe very distinctive smell isn't it
@NotJagath check the numbers again
What instagram SSL certificate has expired?
@udendra @malinthe as you know wery vell, there is no distinction between the v and w
@NotJagath what you've never inhaled HCl before?
@NotJagath Yeah, even if it has a prefix fore. Hope it wasn't that HF you were playing with sometime ago
@NotJagath can you see the bone?
@KawdaBoy @nMeeDiN @nuttygee7 and the twittersphere lost @LyricistHeshan too
@Cokroach @Apelankawe There's nothing like that in the video ne?
Does M$ seriously think people on linux will start using their crappy IDE?
@udendra I heard that they had gained access?
@BuduMalli I am a big fan of the PR system and don't think first past the post is a good idea and present #AAP as conclusive evidence.
Now that 19A is done and dusted, hope the govt can pay more attention to helping Nepal.
@sameera79 ඔල්සෝ, චන්ද්‍රය, චක්කරය ඇන්ඩ් චතුස්තලය
@sameera79 චක්කා  :-)
@sameera79 වලහ ?
@Rathgamaya yes, apparently they had surged past the barriers
@Rathgamaya yes
@ssudaraka it's under administration in the menu. You can install almost anything through that painlessly. Default config works for most
@ssudaraka you don't have to be a command line freak. You can install everything through synaptic, then it's a piece of cake
@minzy34 lots of people have done that but not in a box.
@Miyuruhansi still there in Malabe neda ( I remember you said so. Not seen in Battaramulla for 3-4 years)
@Miyuruhansi you are an unusually courageous person.
@Miyuruhansi forgive me if I missed seeing any tweets from you criticizing MR in those days. I did keep an eye out for such tweets though.
@KolithaBee @Miyuruhansi exactly! if you search for tweets criticizing MR before nov 2014 it's &lt; 1 or 2 per day mostly people abroad.
@Miyuruhansi only because people are shouting at you. But in 2014 we couldn't tweet our views because of white vans.
@malinthe now that is a real car. BMW doesn't make them like that anymore.
@Miyuruhansi As someone who had to shutdown a blog and delete hundreds of tweets in the dark years, I assure you that things have changed!
Now we should get rid of that socialist bit in the name
Hat's off to @PresidentGovLK and @RW_UNP they rose to the occasion. The democratic socialist republic of Sri Lanka is finally a democracy.
Now if #MY3 can dissolve parliament before the 20th amendment is presented it would be perfect.
@LMAshton but he really is losing it though.
@chanux no he is not a politico just a slave
@mahenrr maybe he is to cricket what MS is to SL (ok ok, MS still has a long way to go)
@SueKiri I agree.
@tingilye any room for sabotage?
@SueKiri he is one of MR's slaves he will not agree with the diagnosis
@LMAshton He is one of MR's slaves
@AHemmathagama final vote also passed?
@mhmhisham thanks so plenty of opportunities to drag and delay. Glad it didn't happen.
@udendra he is not a politician just one of the MR slaves.
For constitution changes does the committee stage involve the whole parliament?
My uncle was in perfect mental health till Nov, started deteriorating around that time. Lost all his marbles between Jan 9 and now.
@tingilye @mhmhisham just imagine who nice it would have looked when that island was Kurulu Duva
The slaves don't want freedom and they trying to make the rest of us slaves too.
@dumindaxsb @chanux I never had any hopes for the 19th being passed. Wrong move by MS and RW. Should have dissolved 2 months back.
@chanux @dumindaxsb it's better not to pass the 19A in it's present form, specially with the threat of committee stage sabotage.
@NalakaG is that a rhetorical question?
@Miyuruhansi what does your boyfriend think of that?
@NotJagath so did she keep you away from your brothers?
@NotJagath maybe one of your siblings then?
@NotJagath I can understand the reasoning, but it cannot be avoided when participating in sports, drama, music etc etc
@NotJagath ok, i will bite.
@TheCitizen1 guess the time at which he goes to sleep, add 15 minute to that and then call
@NotJagath Yeah, too many cons. It's already 2.20 when they reach home. Might be 3 with a school van.
I simply can't bear the thought of school tomorrow.
@Lishanw as things stand more like reversal of 18A but SLFP has watered it down even from that.
Initially there were 4 chicks but Koels attacked the nest several times and killed 3 of the chicks. This is the sole survivor (prev tweet)
This little fella tumbled out of his nest bu I managed to put him back. 
@mhmhisham @rupavahinitv @HarshadeSilvaMP Kunuharapa session is about to start :-)
@rothbourne @elmoQ looks like something designed to kill birds
(Polis…
@SNSalgado I was worried for a bit cause the see looked a bit too blue. But you were shooting towards the open see rather than the bay.
@SNSalgado no scratch that. Can't be. The see looks too deep.
@SNSalgado Beuna Vista from Closenburg. correct?
@cernoblog absolutely.
@avirvisva @Seductv great leap forward indeed. The article says launched in 2014 but actually it was launched in 1980
@ravimendis exactly. Hope they learnt a few lessons from the Beragala disaster and put it to good use and save a few lives
Really wonderful to see Sri Lankan armed forces engaged in peaceful missions abroad.
@GehanDG the 19A is hardly recognizable from the original proposal. More amendments have been suggested why bother @Seductv
@binku @alokag definitely
@GehanDG parliament is not serious about anything. The biggest #yahapalanaya mystery is why they didn't dissolve it yet  @Seductv
@binku sadly today I read a news item that some of your money might have ended up in the pocket of a minister. @alokag
@TheCitizen1 that he did, but just imagine if the starting point was 2/3!
@TheCitizen1 no it was the right time. CBK would have got a big majority in 2003 if not for that. and MR 2/3 easily in 2010
@TheCitizen1 very true. Westminister is a total failure, that's why they changed it in the first place.
What stupidity to chop any tree for a stupid "bakthi gee' goes completely against Budda's teachings. 
@gaveen that's what I was afraid you might say :-) @chanux
Confirmation that parliamentary elections will be called; duty on imported onion and potato prices have been increased!
@gaveen I've regrettably had to go back to eclipse cause I couldn't find a proper way to debug django stuff in vim
@AyeshaShehani I used to skip lectures while doing a special too and got into some serious trouble :) what are you reading for?
@AyeshaShehani have you started a special degree?
@AyeshaShehani glad to know that at least some UoC students still play truant.
Finally law and order returns. But we don't want contempt of court to be a tool of oppression again. 
@binku oh! didn't know it was donation driven! Good of you to make a contribution. Weren't the Indians supposed to funded it? @alokag
@NotJagath oh didn't know you had two of them. Well some tough aussie might knock some sense into him.
@NotJagath brother also?
@Lishanw they just left and will be happy to know
@Lishanw kids wanted to goto the library but after seeing @Miyuruhansi 's tweet I asked them to wait till after 9:00 glad I did!
@mjmmanoj and we will never get to see an official list of those names ( a few of those accounts maybe legit of course)
@gaveen this is pretty good. Thanks for sharing
@gaveen i've used Jbuilder, KDevelop, Anjuta, Netbeans, bluefish and geany. They all suck. maybe time to get serious about vim ? :)
@gaveen A whole gamut of IDEs last few years eclipse (yeah it sucks). Didn't start using linux full time till I could get X setup
@gaveen never never simply because I only know the very basic vi commands and nothing else :-)
@NalindaSh i used it for quite a while before switching to full time. First was a slackware a friend from UK gave me circa 1996
@ravimendis nah gedit is better :-)
I've been on linux full time for more than 15 years now and never took  part in a vim vs emacs battle. Life is incomplete!!
Those who think #lka needs a first past the post electoral system please google for #newdelhi  elections or just #aap
@CrazyPusa nothing about his own doings of course
Remember when the chief justice was impeached because she gave a ruling against the Divi Neguma?
Wish my neighbor (a nice elderly gentleman) would realize that email forwards were replaced by Facebook shares about 7-8 years back.
@DJSlash9 but that's not as bad as IE 7 or 8
@DJSlash9 I also have scant regard for older browsers. Me thinks these are postive moves
@DJSlash9 well applets are mostly dead but the AWS move will break a lot of websites for people with older browsers
Google drops support for applets, AWS drops support for SSL V3 (about time too). A very eventful period.
@NotJagath being the least popular of the quartet he took a big risk coming back at this stage. Still trying to figure out why.
@BuduMalli it will take a lot of effort to just rub out the points lost over the last two three days
Finally a high profile arrest. BR must have been crazy to have returned after bro was summoned to the bribery commission.
@AnfasJM that bloody place should be shut down. @SueKiri
@AnfasJM an animal that needs about 5000 acres of range
@sarojpathi @PresRajapaksa @groundviews @NalakaG @akeenan23 to sabotage the 19A of course.
So even MR admits that he did wrong but the Baiyas continue to deny that he ever did anything wrong. 
@alokag I've been to the T.kelle club a couple of times but that was a long long time back. There was no military there those days.
@alokag the place is very different now. Didn't know they had a STF camp near Yoxford and a bigger camp near the bridge over the railway
@alokag twice! BTW, passed through your neck of the woods. Did a circuit of the two bridges via Holyrood.
@dark5un yep. And tech is making the average age of the top players head south
Hat's off to the #lka pro MR parliamentarians. The comedy they are enacting over last two days have made voters forget 100 days of bungling.
@dark5un sorry for late reply. Was away for a few days. Yes that guy was one of the few to have been caught. It's rampant
@minzy34 didn't think much of it even as a kid
Just noticed that in Centos 7 the used and free memory columns are switched and used memory no longer includes buffers/caches.
@mahenrr the best part is he didn't actually cross over to the UNP like some of the others! @Seductv
@Seductv @mahenrr he and ravik cost RW the prime ministership once. They have done it again. (yes use of the word done is intentional)
Now going to remove all the public IPs from everything but the 2 nginx servers. Does it sound like I have a lot of hardware? Sadly no.
@troy1lk @TheLankanIdiot @trappedalien so sad that even the notice is drooping a bit.
Contrary to what Amazon tells you, you don't need a special NAT instance to access the outside world from a machine with out an EIP.
Damn it's been too long since I last played with routing tabled what should have been done in 2 minutes took me bloody hours and hours
Now that the big boys have stopped their new year promotions, small guys like us can finally get our ads shown on FB and Adwords
@trappedalien also planned to swap the road.lk primary db with a bigger box but wont be able to finish it because nonagathe expires :-(
Inauspicious times it seems. Well so far I have setup a memcached server and now setting up a new DB.
The friendly neighborhood stray dog is nicely curled up under a bed and refuses to budge. Must somehow chase her to the garage at least
@dumindaxsb I always felt that they just made the right noises and token protests and let MR have his way
In stark contrast to Postgresql mysql replication is so simple that someone with only a little bit of experience could do it.
One thing I didn't bargain for was the huge amount of time recovering from WAL archives takes. (no didn't have a crash just testing)
Our TV get's switched on only on those rate occasions when @saadhu or my mother in law is on it. But not today (the damned thing wont work!)
New year in Kerala 
hm, elaborate april fool's joke at HAProxy. 
@SueKiri We live in a cul de sac so our dog also roams free (or has the option to) but in practice she needs to be thrown out to walk.
Our dog doesn't actually mind crackers. She is nearly deaf. But I feel bad about the neighbourhood stray, she will have to hide under a car
@SueKiri has poddala grown into a town now? 0_0 @sameera79
@cernoblog good to know that your #Cthulhu uses linux
WTF is this firewall-cmd what ever happened to iptables?
Isn't it the dutch who brought kojis? The Protugese did bring Kaju another symbol of the new year. 
Today if someone grew a beard like Lincoln's and walked on the streets of the US, the chances are he might get beaten up.
Love at first sight with Amazon EFS
Woah the Bayya number #2 has admitted that 4.2 million was paid to that air hostess (but says out of his own funds) 
@hiranyas great news
@hiranyas oh didn't know you had a baby :)
@Spooky_Flyer93 I used to hate that stuff as an undergrad. One of my weakest subjects those days but now I love it.
@EpWickey illegal too i should think @dumindaxsb
@EpWickey exactly did you see the headlines? ( I didn't read any of the articles) @dumindaxsb
@seniinthebox tell me about it. My wife absolutely refuses to by me beer, and since I don't goto the super market. I never get one :(
@Chevindu that poor guy is going to get beaten up by his cell mates in remand. Has his life destroyed and court may find not guilty.
In #lka you can't get a fair trial.  Newspapers write their headlines pronouncing you guilty. without trial (unless you are a minister)
@lahirunirmala if you are coding in PHP, even in 2015 that's the way to do it. @DJSlash9
Why @PMOIndia have you banned Greeneace?
@DJSlash9 and you were a webdev before you because  DJ right? Is that what you are doing again or now into management? @lahirunirmala
@lahirunirmala yeah, that's the way we did things in the 90s
@lahirunirmala welcome to the 90s
@himalkk @chanux thank you for the suggestion. SInce I am totally clueless about Tinder, let me get back to you on this!
@minzy34 you mean go all over the city like people do at big match parades (sitting awkwardly on a window sill ?)
@Sabithl Then I will have to sort of lie on my side and try to look sexy.
@kazZtr_ :-)
@kazZtr_ road.lk not a good product to sell?
@udithaumesh @himalkk you sure? Somethings can't be unseen
Would road.lk go viral if I posted a pic of me sitting on my battered old W123 wearing nothing but a loin cloth?
hm, retweeting a retweet with a comment doesn't look so hot. Or maybe it's just a twitter client issue?
@Lishanw A bunch of friends had been using every expletive in Sinhala loudly on a Chennai street just for kicks.  When someone asked that
Yipeee the monsoon is here!
Installing postgis on centos 7 was completely painless. Now that's a pleasant surprise.
@VillSumith actually lots of places do, eg USA, Aus, Canada etc (either as former capital or political/business separation) @IsuruSam
@VillSumith @IsuruSam probably before you were even born!
@TheCitizen1 :) no that isn't your car then. I thought it was
@TheCitizen1 4032?
@zrimax used to be at Sri Lankan neda?
@KolithaBee hopefully you are not quoting the met department
I am pretty sure that the bird that's eating the breadcrumbs I left for the squirrels is actually a flycatcher.
" Found yourself uttering “argh!” while struggling with the API of argparse?" 
hm, well almost
@Vidiyallk @mhmhisham so it's true that the cartel does not allow muslims to open shows in Kiribathgoda?
@TheCitizen1 oh I think it's very likely that you are right. @arvindjkv
@TheCitizen1 the worse thing is that some well known lankan doctors joined that bandwagon @arvindjkv
@arvindjkv lol there was a time when westen media totally vilified coconut oil (slump in Soy Prices had something to do with it) @csglobe
@Sansajran floor it
@trappedalien i fear you are right.
The same people who were screaming just a month ago that 'BCCI is ruining cricket' now seem very excited about the IPL
@KolithaBee for you my dear sir, Negombo would be a lot closer and probably the same price @TheCitizen1
@kattasambal no that's simply not true! (it's more like 90%) @TChanaH @TheCitizen1 @maranaya
@KolithaBee adapting is the way to got.  @elmoQ
@TChanaH @TheCitizen1 @maranaya    වැඩක් න අප්පා කතාකරල මේවා කරන උන්ම තම අපේ සංස්කෘතිය ගැන බොහොම ආඩම්බරයෙන් කතා කරන්නේ
@KolithaBee this dog is a stray that we adapted, in fact we adapted two but the other one died of an unknown reason. @elmoQ
@KolithaBee not at all never. When she was outside she either stayed in the garage or backyard (we have a small shelter) @elmoQ
@elmoQ well we did keep her outside at first because she was chewing up stuff and we used to have two dogs before.
@NalakaG rest assured that it will only be used in that way.
@cernoblog but this time they have a real incentive for doing so! @flysrilankan
The only thing shocking about the allegations of corruption at @flysrilankan is the govt failing to take any action against the culprits.
@thameera I am also opposed to banner ads but putting a paywall might be a lot of work and you will still need to spend to get conversions

@thameera but if you do spend on marketing you might be able to recover it by displays ads on it. There's plenty of space
@thameera no the site is good as it is. Just do a bit of marketing. I don't mean spending big bucks. SM posts. Put in email signatures etc
@TChanaH what do you expect when treasure hunters have been ministers for decades are some still are?
Many of the people that I interacted the most with twitter in the early days are no more on twitter. Many inactive for 4+ years
@thameera why don't you jump start typing.lk again? That was a really cool project.
Morning exercise: pick up dog. Walk outside. Put dog on the ground. Rush back in before the dogs does. Repeat until successful.
If HSBC and Standard Chartered checked my balance they would stop sending me these idiotic spam texts
@himalkk heading to Ukraine or nothern nigeria by any chance?
@himalkk you mean nightmare?

Scandals are so common in sl politics that no one ever users the word anymore but an international level scandal involving 3-4 countries?
@TheCitizen1 well there's the answer :-)
@muditha do we have any socialist parties at all?
@TheCitizen1 do they still have those AA guns out in front?
@minzy34 thanks
@minzy34 good morning!
@minzy34 At your service :)
Very, very excited that road.lk is to be featured on BBC Sinhala. Many thanks to @AzzamAmeen  and Wimalasena Hewage

@EranWick why not?
හනේ මන්ද දැන් කලේ ළමය්න්ට් ඉන්නේර් ජෝඉන් එකක් වත්  ලියා ගන්න බැරි හැටි.
@Lishanw yes FT said Rs 30B while DM said USD 30M as you have noticed they are not equal (except in the eyes of our politicos)
Politicians and journalists please note that a Million has 7 digits and a Billion has 10
@malinthe yeah I know it's bloody dangerous enough as it is. Absolutely ridiculous @Lishanw
@Lishanw exactly @malinthe no bikes allowed on highways
@arvindjkv @MarianneDavid24 but the curious thing is Rajitha says commissions are paid upfront so how?
@vajirasumeda @SueKiri @sandunarosha as usually happens wiht governments the left hand doesn't know what the right does :)
@ZamanX90 superb!
@ZackeyAhmed is that sunken barge that used to be near Wellawatte station still there or has it completely broken up now?
thanks @SampathBankPLC for sorting that out.
@SampathBankPLC someone finally called me and seems to have sorted it out but I am puzzled why getting a response feels like pulling teeth
dear @SampathBankPLC it's six days since I sent a mail. Two days since i sent you a DM. Do you guys even check emails?
@Anjalaf @Lishanw @takashiG well they are doing it already. Remember you need to give all this stuff when getting a BB connection.
@kazZtr_ yep you can even get 20% of agents price. 25% if you know someone at the shop @AutoGuideLk
@kazZtr_ you will be surprised to know that tyre shops give better prices than agents. @AutoGuideLk
@kazZtr_ @AutoGuideLk yeah few months back I checked prices on autodrome. it took me several minutes to realize the prices were from 2013
@kazZtr_ sorry no @AutoGuideLk
@UdithaRana it's not development just destruction @TheCitizen1
@malinthe I will try out Hansa (assuming I can get permission from my wife)
@ahamednishadh #ayyosalli
Buried deep in this article is an allegation that Tagore wrote the #lka national anthem. 
@malinthe I got migraine Sunday. It was all your fault (your cold brew twitpic sent me down that path)
@KolithaBee @TheCitizen1 and actually he was a nice guy to begin with. So that should be amended to 3 or 4 years I guess.
@KolithaBee @TheCitizen1 I was one for 12 long years but there was no choice. Guy had a virtual monopoly
@malinthe where can you get good stuff? (good &lt;&gt; expensive :-)  )
@TheCitizen1 of course for inspiration you needed look any further than the former mechanic of your car :-) @KolithaBee
@TheCitizen1 but now barriers to entry is very high isn't it with the high cost of equipment and parts? @KolithaBee
@KolithaBee ela! @Fulton89
@AyeshaShehani marriage certificate might be cheap now but divorce is still very expensive!!
@KTheena it's something that surfaces about once every 10 years. So far kandyans have been smarter than people from other places in LKA
@KTheena idiots
@mayooresan you are doing an excellent job of citizen journalism yourself!
@hirosht thanks! IN the meantime I think one of my cleanup tools have unfollowed you :-). FOllowing right back
@Channa_Amare the spin masters are at work. pun intended.
@kazZtr_ that sounds more like it. @KolithaBee
@kazZtr_ very unusual that you are having so many visits. Civic is generally a low maintenance car. @KolithaBee
@dark5un well NSB in the 90s I think had about a quarter percent higher interest than most other banks for savings :-) @SampathBankPLC
Sometimes dealing with @sampathbankplc feels like dealing with the 1990s version of NSB.
@BoraS85 I heard that you are moving. All the best. I picked up your kid about a month back. What a cute baby she is.
@NalindaSh IVR system validates by asking for phone number? Seems pretty silly
hm dept of examinations is using JSF.
@seniinthebox hm but that's what the majority seems to want. They can't seem to appreciate a pristine lake or marsh unless it's paved.
@seniinthebox they have sanitized Kurunegala lake too?
@Fulton89 definitely
@Fulton89 eldest one read 5 last month. Took a break for term tests. Might have finished the other two by now I think.
@Sansajran whatever that works! I used to enjoy Sinhala books too. Haven't read one for about an year though. Now I hardly get to read
@colombobelle come to think of it. Sherlock might be a good idea. Thanks I was never a fan of whodunits myself so it didn't occur to me
@DasFuhrerin One of the biggest problems me and my wife has is to get them to put down their books and do something worthwhile!
@Fulton89 :) they have nothing at all that would interest them
@Sansajran Better fill up whenever you get the chance. Prices only go up! and good books are hard to find
@Miyuruhansi I agree with you. Heck i couldn't even read English books till I was about 8 or 9!
@Fulton89 not when you have to find them books to read!!
@DasFuhrerin wasn't that part of to kill a mocking bird? :-)
@Miyuruhansi sadly to my father's great annoyance they don't read many sinhala books :(
@DasFuhrerin but thanks for the recommendation. I will work on it.
@Miyuruhansi they've read all the ladybird versions The originals are a bit violent and gory neda?
@Fulton89 3
@DasFuhrerin at school the two girls are only allowed to borrow stuff which they consider babish :(
@NotJagath I think I will take you up on the Royal College offer :-) @Dili
@Dili I also swear by those bookshops! I know it sounds implausible but anything in any CMB bookshop they have read! @NotJagath
@Yazblu Mallory Towers done, same for Wishing chair, Far Away tree and Naugtiest girl, St. Clair now I think you might begin understand :-)
@Dili unfortunately he schools in Battaramulla but the other two are at Bishops so they might be able to get. Thanks for tip. @NotJagath
@Dili I also used to have membership long time ago when we did live in teh city limits. Must try to work something out :-) @NotJagath
@Yazblu they have read entire famous 5 + secret 7 + adventure series + mystery series .
@NotJagath We are outside city limits but they all have British Council membership and my father takes about about once a week.
Their reading habits are such that my eldest often finishes a whole book between the library and home   (books of about 150-200 pages)
@Miyuruhansi 5 minutes reading. We have about 50 at home. He finished them all by the age or 4.5 :)
@Miyuruhansi He has read them all + quite a few more Enid Blytons. Name any good childrens' book in any SL store and my kids have read it!
@Miyuruhansi Books targeted at 6 year olds he finished in 5 minutes. Takes only about 2 hours to finish an Enid Blyton Famous 5 or Secret 7
School holidays coming up. Finding books to read specially for the 6 year old is a huge challenge.
@sameera79 BTW, ambrose's final run rate was &lt; 3.5 I think even McGrath was close to 4
@sameera79 these days yorkers are going for six. so Garner would go for 10 - 15 an over. Bounce them and it will sail over the slips
If Garner, Ambrose, Mcgrath and Pollock played cricket today, even  they would go for 7.5 runs per over
@PortelloFanatic only trouble is they don't seem to realize that they lost the arg
@KTheena sympathize?
@elmoQ that I gathered, but this is Danny boys last match right? I think he is pretty lucky to be here. He wasn't even in contention 6mo ago
@elmoQ don't tell me Malinga has also retired!?
@arvindjkv trying to be a lightening rod? :-)
I've always been a fan of bowlers never of batsmen. Except for Sanga have to go back to the days of Hooper and Richardson to find another
Last match for Danny boy. After that there malinga is the only cricketer whom I can say I am a fan of. Still no plan of watching the match.
@RubenThurairaj which I already have
We have more than enough land in #lka provided as we don't waste it on inland harbours, airports, stadiums and unsuitable crops like sugar
@sukhijay dono the name initially I thought it was one from korothota but a port city visitor said rocks from gampaha
Feel like I've become a retweet but all in a good cause
@Yazblu yes you are right. Maggi didn't leave a bad taste in the mouth
@Yazblu exactly, a cheap publicity stunt. Fonterra did it too. Then coke, then Maggi.
The same people who get their knickers in a twist about bottom trawling in the palk straits don't mind dredging on the Colombo coastline.
We are bulldozing a hill and dumping it to the sea. Patriotic Sri Lankans are cheering saying it's progress and the hell with nature. #lka
@SueKiri yeah? where do they get the rocks from China? @Yazblu
@Yazblu a large section of a hill in Kaduwela transferred there bit by bit?
@malinthe why you mum's a school principal right? They don't usually approve of heavy metal do they?
@malinthe විදුහල්පතිතුමි මොකෝ මේගැන කියන්නේ?
The Colombo Port City is the single most idiotic mega project (or mega deal ) ever undertaken in the history of #lka
@SueKiri no thank you. @CmbPortCity @K_Somaratne @GehanDG :-)
@KolithaBee can't argue with that. Hopefully they will utilize some of the choppers that are now supposedly lying idle for that purpose
@KolithaBee the first one was s story doing the rounds. THe second one was tabled in parliament under medical aid given to MPs
@Lishanw you noticed who is doing it now? :)
@KolithaBee i am just guessing (not justifying) that when faced with such situations estrangements are soon forgotten.
@KolithaBee yeah good point! But in the old days even dogs got airlifted :) and Keheliya got 44 million for just breaking a leg!
Remember how Fonterra got into a soup and hired an ad firm to get tweeps to visit their factory and tweet about it and all that?
@KolithaBee only if the dead guy was  friend of the cops. My understanding is that him and MS were estranged.
AWS r3.large or m3.xlarge ?
@Miyuruhansi yep, I lost my yahoo account which I think I opened around 1997 that way. Same happend to my 
Heavy traffic near bishops due to premature end to sports meet and rain
Primary sports meets at bishop's traffic all round. Cops just asked vehicles parked on sir James to be removed
@ShammasGhouse didn't you just post on FB that you are keeping away from both FB and twitter? :-)
@himalkk now she is tearing the wool off it, next time she does it i'll try
Our dog doesn't want anyone to throw a ball for her. She drops it at the top of the staircase and chases it down. Then it's back up again.
@PortelloFanatic i'd say toss up between him and Mugabe
@Anjalaf spank him
@conservecarbon how can these artificial botanic gardens be tagged as #conservation?
@NotRomesh nah I never believe in that stuff (even though lightening took out my entire home network once)
@seniinthebox you mean tweeting
@LordPeterWimsey @himalkk people don't hate Indian at least AFAIK it's the Indian cricketers that everyone hates.
@TheCitizen1 I think it is because the Nawala one had a white on black plate + spoiler @kazZtr_
@TheCitizen1 @kazZtr_  if I am not mistaken this car is mostly in Nawala and I think it's a recon.
@kiriappeee hell yes! I can't read my own perl code! Thankfully haven't had to write any in years and years @ssudaraka
Gonna a need a new DB box. Not sure if I should be happy or sad.
@hirosht if you don't mind, please do unlink this spammy app from your account. After all the twitter join date is now visible on profile
@himath pretty much the same. In fact I didn't watch any of the matches. Haven't watched any cricket at all since 2011 finals.
@SueKiri exactly in front of the Lipton Circus. Being a govt. shop not flashy that's why you probably haven't noticed.
@SueKiri isn't SPC in Town hall the best place for drugs? But aren't they providing at the hospital?
@JustRuky talk to @cernoblog  he will arrange it
@himath Have you been following the cricket? I remember the long discussions we used to have about Curtly Ambrose and co those days.
@himath ah there you are.
@FahimFarook yes I know. Going to trim things down a bit again.
@FahimFarook probably! I see that you have really trimmed it down now. I am honored to be one of the few in your list :-)
@FahimFarook Jeremy Clarkson has apprently been fired. Since then 20% of tweets on my timeline seem to be on this subject
The biggest issue that people on twitter are faced with now is the fate of a TV presenter.
@ssudaraka would you believe I haven't watched TV news since 2010?
@parishna still not supporting SA?
@TheCitizen1 finally they are putting that right noh? Inspite of all the blunders the president and PM at least seem to have courage for it
How did @Ceylinco_Life get hold of my personal details for their spam calls? Is it just from mining the social web or some other way?
@laktek I've been there only once for  week. I passed through a second time, decided to read a book at airport instead of stepping out.
I really don't understand this outpouring of grief over Lee Kuan Yew.
@SueKiri usually at a ripe old age @SNSalgado
@himalkk Landing near my place? (Diyawanna) I will come out and wave
@himalkk on a helitour?
@SNSalgado Politicians never retire they just fade away or get imprisoned.
@PortelloFanatic no we can't he is set for 5 years. All we can do is send ranil home. Which we definitely should do.
@CrazyPusa @rw_unp I think it's now pretty much assured that MR will be next PM. Hope they don't change the constitution!!
@ZamanX90 because the @officialunp has just committed political suicide.
@CrazyPusa yes @RW_UNP knows that with the bungling of the last two months he can't win. So it's make hay for 2 years while sun shines.
It will be a huge achievement if @officialunp manages to secure 10 seats at the next general election.
@udendra wonder how many wrong doers might get ministries instead!
@Channa_Amare ah but Danny boy apparently disappeared for 40 something in two overs yesterday!
Because you can make money out of it and you can clear up this jam!


This is a country where 5.8 million people voted for MR and sing his praises. So it's not a surprise that a tree is being cut down near by.
@dumindaxsb I flunked it! had to goole. Real geeks don't use windows :-)
@Channa_Amare Ah didn't know you had become a cricket fan! Given up on football?
The only follower on my 8 year old never used flickr account is @yajith  wonder why he's gone silent on twitter though.
@kattasambal @himalkk @TheSauceCode these things are pretty cheap on ebay.
@kattasambal @himalkk @TheSauceCode yep touch screen + glass shipped as one unit. Get it done by expert or you will have dead spots
@Miyuruhansi yeps, and what you get in CMB is ශ්‍රී ලංකා කලු වදුරා = Purple face languar @TheCitizen1
@TheCitizen1 @Miyuruhansi හැලි වදුරා  is Grey Languar and also found in India so not endangered (yet)
@TheCitizen1 but this is කලු වදුරා different from හැලි වදුරා  both bearded but slightly different colors @Miyuruhansi
@TheCitizen1 the bearded fellow you find in the wet zone is the one! Endemic to Sri Lanka and found only in wet zone @Miyuruhansi
@TheCitizen1 @Miyuruhansi dont' the purple faced leaf monkey is endangered now
Once upon a time only the truly outstanding batsmen could score 150 in an ODI now anyone can score 200 in a high pressure knockout.
@PortelloFanatic what is the correlation coefficient like?
@KTheena haven't seen'em but heard of them Hey but we are not going to agree on this thing :)
@KTheena only watched the first minute. Dujon apparently took that kinds of wkt catches in the 80s
@KTheena yes, fielders are probably better at chasing the ball to the boundary now.
@KTheena on the contrary even in 2005 there were good competitive matches. It was powerplays and IPL that killed it
@imthaz don't worry he will come out of retirement (again)
@KTheena I used to enjoy cricket was bowlers had an equal chance. Haven't watched a match since 2011 CWC final.
The #LKA prime minister's loyalty is admirable. He is even willing to sacrifice is own job to protect that of his friend.
Nasheed banishes dictator. Nasheed bungles. Dictator rallies forces.
Nasheed forced to resign. Nasheed jailed.
Hope doesn't happen in #lka
@Lishanw anway it's awfully slow there isn't it?
Stupid things done by this government keeps adding up. Now it's price control for a cup of tea. Is this the @officialunp free market?
@TheCitizen1 + there were plenty of people who got threatening phone calls,  people on bikes outside their houses etc @thusinutz
@Channa_Amare hi time you hatched that egg you know (profile picture update )
@TheCitizen1 @thusinutz I kept my mouth shut and took my blog offline circa 2008. Always reviewed tweets and deleted indiscreet ones
This government has done some incredibly stupid things but we are free to criticize. something that was unthinkable just six months ago.

@DJSlash9 I actually went about an 2 years ago to get a replacement hard disk. Had no choice.
I am guessing that the shop that caught fire today is the bankrupt PC House that has hundreds of millions worth of unsellable inventory
When mishits by tail enders land ten rows back you can hardly call cricket a game of skill.
I will start watching cricket again if and when a score of 250 becomes a competitive total.
@ZamanX90 the so called Batticaloa burghers speak Tamil all other speak Sinhala fluently because they have no choice (school for example)
@zenrainman that's bad. The laws on this regard (and their enforcement) are probably as bad as they are here or perhaps even worse I suppose
@ZamanX90 Their numbers used to be much higher but the community was decimated when they migrated in droves following 'Sinhala Only' policy
@ZamanX90 forgetting the very small Burgher community whose mother tongue is English.
@zenrainman detergents?
As someone who doesn't actually watch cricket but merely checks scores in cricinfo (irregularly) I didn't expect to the this effected by it!
Namal, the great friend of Cabraal leading protests against CB governor? That's a bit rich.
@SriLankaTelecom First lesson in SM. Don't send canned replies. Talk to  @AnjulaMalshan for more useful tips.
@parishna thought you would be happy about it!
@himalkk cricket ball?
@CrazyPusa good if it happens but don't be disappointed if it doesn't
Don't write off the South Africans. All trends are eventually broken.
I must be the only Sri Lankan in a home office who hasn't switched on the TV.
@CrysKoel no I meant lime with what else in the glass :-)
hm that seaplane sounds like it has engine trouble.
@NotJagath Oh and BTW, I am always confused whether Jagath is the right name to address you with on twitter or the other one.
@AHemmathagama that panel is hardly impartial. Even MR's panels were less partial than this @CBSL @RW_UNP
@NotJagath must be a ransom note or a blackmail note then. Shouldn't have taken that thing out of your pants so often.
@AnjulaMalshan kudus to @dialoglk and @EtisalatSL . Though we lose our tempers they keep theirs and respond quickly.
@NotJagath in other news you got slapped with a margin call or something?
@NotJagath finally seems to have fixed it! @SriLankaTelecom let's see how it goes.
@SriLankaTelecom Alright. Just received a call from your office and they assured me that they have fixed the issue. thanks
But @SriLankaTelecom I have already emailed, I have already called and I have already tweetd. Why do I need to send you a FB message as well
@dumindaxsb fortunately MS doesn't seem to be doing that (as seen by his wresting control of SLFP and UPFA)
@dumindaxsb the real conspiracy seems to be between MR and RW. RW is doing everything in his power to see that MR is returned as PM
@udendra must be thinking Namal is a threat for the next election :)
@SueKiri 80?
Dear @SriLankaTelecom your connection is still dropping every few minutes. All I got from 1212 is a reference number.
@CrysKoel with?
@seniinthebox these ought to be posted with the number plate visible.
@SriLankaTelecom I have already explained my situation. Your ADSL disconnects every few minutes and then reconnects.
@EtisalatSL I was appreciating the fact that you replied when I had an issue couple of weeks back though you couldn't fix it then @SueKiri
@EtisalatSL Actually I don't have an issue with you ATM. Using my etisalat BB cause my @SriLankaTelecom ADSL is flaky. @SueKiri
@yaps9 @PriyaRaju @MrPolyatheist other govts don't even dare to speak out agasint the Saudi HR record.
@SueKiri at least @EtisalatSL is courteous enough to reply. @SriLankaTelecom never does. ADSL issues since last Friday.
@SNSalgado :(
@sameera79 ah there we are !! @udendra @sameerawim
@udendra good question! What sterotype to use! @sameerawim It was just a mistake. I probably misfiled another sameera on twitter in my head
@HarshadeSilvaMP hard hitting interviews are fairly useless
@sarojpathi @NalakaG sure about Ireland?
@sameerawim :-) just the impression that I had
Dear @SriLankaTelecom why does #lka ADSL keep disconnecting and reconnecting every five minutes? Happening since last friday
@yshiromi so how? Long time no chat. How's your friend @roshm ? shes silent for even longer I think
@Dinouk_C first bilateral visit in 28 years actually they've been here for SAARC
@sameerawim till now I thought you were a Nalandian :-)
@yshiromi don't work in Negombo anymore?
@iFeelYouJohanna oh that's the name of the cocktail! Didn't know. I only drink beer. @SueKiri
@iFeelYouJohanna @SueKiri what the heck is that?
@Pamiya89 oops! hope no one has sent him any personalized messages!
to the tune of Bohemian Rhapsody (previous RT)
no escape from this slt,
Open your lines,
Download frm the cloud and see,
It's just a sales ploy, their sp…
@ssudaraka  no escape from reality
@VillSumith Gama Galla, ..ka lalla @SueKiri
@SueKiri hm @VillSumith must be from Galle
@alokag nopes! thanks for pointing out. I guess little niggles are creeping in here and there as the visitors grow. Will check and get back
I need a cure for my latest addiction of counting how many rideshares posted on road.lk ever 5 minutes (805 now)
@Seductv I've seen him at a hefty iMac in a twitter Q&amp;A so you would be right. @Lishanw @shenukalles @CrazyNalin
@Lishanw @shenukalles @CrazyNalin wonder if Namal will get one.
And the library is invaded by rats. Dogs are better at catching them than cats. so far the score stands 2-1 in the dogs favour.
@PortelloFanatic @binku @NisansaDdS @NotJagath sounds like I have missed a good fight
@5a2a5i will not be a big issue if used issue only arises if left standing for days.
The way I argue with @5a2a5i on twitter tweeps must think we are sworn enemies! Actually we are old buddies that's why arguments get heated
@NalakaG it was gazetted I believe. another journo tweeted a link
@5a2a5i It's not essential but without adding chlorine don't feel like using neda :)
@5a2a5i yeah not big deal, you just need to add a bit of chlorine this is only for gardening and washing cars ne
@5a2a5i and grey water harvesting needs three tanks + space where as rain water harvesting needs only two and not so much space.
@5a2a5i I initially wanted to do grey water harvesting. That's more usefull because it's available 365 days but I was shouted down.
@5a2a5i guy called raditha
@5a2a5i yeah the bloody motor has packed in and need to get it replaced but the tank is anyway empty these days
Shall we get back to the Mattala airport @5a2a5i ? The money could have been used to pay Rs 1,500 every man woman and child in Sri Lanka
@5a2a5i and also I put in rain water harvesting and solar power when no one in Sri Lanka even considered it. Let's get back to $USD 350 M
@5a2a5i FYI, I carefully chose a land without any trees. All doors windows are recycled. Same with lots of bricks and some furniture.
@5a2a5i so let's forget forests and get back to the USD 350 million wasted then + USD 18 million per year it cost Sri Lankan to land there.
So @5a2a5i you are saying USD 350 million wasted on a ego boosting airport is just a number? What about the birds and elephants that died?
@CrazyPusa slightly more glamorous that Mahinda Rajapaksha bus service but still not the same as Mahinda Rajakpaksha airport
@5a2a5i So it's stupid to criticize a project that robbed the country of USD 350 million and destroyed 25000 acres of forest?
@CrazyPusa but then can't put his name on it noh?
@binku the jungle should be allowed to reclaim is but the govt wants to continue to flog the dead horse (convert into a repair center)
@KolithaBee Rs 250 M per month to run it. 50 passengers per day at peak. Do the arithmatic
At it's peak levels of travel, cost per passenger at the #lka Mattala (birdkiller) Airport was about 167,000
At it's peak Mattala airport had 50 passengers per day. Mostly people who had never flown before flying between BIA and Mattala just for fun
@5a2a5i how many passengers per month before Sri Lankan stopped flying there?
@draftbot97 future per capita income is likely to increase? sounds like a brilliant idea. Keep up the good work. 3/3
@draftbot97 and highways as it will increase future per capita income. So you are saying president has to charter a flight because  2/3
@draftbot97 Thank you for the economic lesson. Originally you spoke of current per capita. Now you are justifying tax and spend 1/3
@draftbot97 and 15 years ago Sri Lankan airlines was a profitable company and govt could afford to charter a plane if needed.
@draftbot97 per capita income is not a useful indication. It's bloated by highway projects money that doesn't get into the hands of people
@draftbot97 not a fanboy and not biting :-) just enlighting. BTW, during Sirima's time ministers had to travel economy class.
@draftbot97 that's how every president and prime minister of Sri Lanka except MR travelled. Wouldn't have been news 15 years ago
It's hard being @RW_UNP. When Indian fishermen poach; it's his fault. When navy takes no action; his fault. When navy shoot; again his fault
@CrysKoel the amount of money you spent travelling from bookshop to bookshop would be 2x the cost of printing from pdf :)
@CrysKoel but why? Almost any 19th century book is available for free download.
@KaluMallii thanks. I will update the road.lk table with that
@KaluMallii thought it was called off after last year. When is the date?
@SueKiri huh? what did I do?
@thameera decided to try out a toy you bought for one of your young cousins?
@himZter @nalu_batta satire wenna athi ne?
@TheCitizen1 you are not taking the e30 are you? BTW i suddenly remembered that CPC ads are also called PPC. Silly me :)
@AyeshaShehani Mama nam kanne alumka ekenui bluebells ekenui thamai ithin @AnjulaMalshan
@CrysKoel I came pretty late and tried to merge into a wall as much as possible.
@AyeshaShehani things on the other side of the stupid bridge don't count @AnjulaMalshan
@BuduMalli if he gets into parliament (which he will if he contests), he will find a way to become PM
@CrysKoel oh goodie! you are first girl I met (come to think of it we haven't met) who happens to be one. So what's with the cross?
@AyeshaShehani there's a breadtalk in battaramulla? @AnjulaMalshan
@AnjulaMalshan first stop at Sen Saal, then at Klassy, then P&amp;S and finally at the FAB,m you better get back here quick @AyeshaShehani
@TheCitizen1 no started a cost per click campaign. Some keywords have about USD 1.00 as the minimum bid
@sarojpathi yes, I intended those as rhetorical questions to raise the same point you did @PresidentGovLK
@PresidentGovLK is such an appointment really needed? Is he a career diplomat?  @sarojpathi
Been a long time since i last used Adwords. Astonishing how the CPC has gone up. Adsense publishers still make next to nothing.
@AyeshaShehani I always went home at 5:00 serving it after 5:00 probably kept an eye out and waited till I passed the gate
@kazZtr_ good to know. Not many people get it :-)
The reality is that the govt can't move too quickly address all the problems northerners face. Southern extremists will kick them out.
I am sympathetic towards the sufferings of the northerners but it seems pretty stupid to spurn the moves by the govt to address them.
@kazZtr_ that's Baiya's for you but I was just pointing out what exactly happened at Diyatha Uyana.
@kazZtr_ they paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Literally.
@alokag didn't know the year but that Galant is so easily recognizable.
@alokag ah the nicest looking family car to come out of japan in the last twenty years!
@alokag ah the nicest looking family car to come out of japan in the last two years!
@malinthe Kaluah?
@NotJagath you in HK?
@PortelloFanatic the sticker is from small bookshop. Current lappy is from Amazon and rather old. @kattasambal
@kattasambal for the past 6-8 years such decisions have been made for me by the kids. Right now it's a superman sticker.
#lka Deputy minister of justice wants to bring back capital punishment!? how about arresting a few criminals first?
@sameera79 I got the feeling the yesterdays protest was stage managed kind of like the stuff Basil used to do.
@CrysKoel so you are biggles fan too?
@NalakaG Kandalama protest was hijacked by nut cases. There were very valid concerns + other hotels in the area were worse offenders
@FahimFarook is that a typo or intentional? @chanux
Despite reading around 40 Biggles books I didn't know he had a brother and argued with the kids. Ended up being embarrassed.
@rothbourne yes we were thinking of unlinking you :) @milindat @halfdoctor @gopiharan
@Fulton89 and the question is how many times must a cannon balls fly?
A fight between a bul-bul and a gecko just outside the window. The gecko finally managed to crawl inside and save himself.
I thought my son would start reading my Biggles collection when he is about 10. He is still only 6 but read Biggles in School in two hours.
@PaperDosai I thought the UoM event had come to a halt.
@PaperDosai I will tell the president of the league about this move and ask them to help if they can.
@PaperDosai Malinda Gunawardena? I haven't met him buy know him by reputation. I've been urging the league to get into the univesitires
@PaperDosai what a pity. We lose all our best players when they leave school. Are you at UoC medical faculty?
Just posted a 8.7km ride share with @road_lk. Check it out!  
@seniinthebox another one of those tweets that needs to have an attachment.
@TheCitizen1 yeah, they are very rare now that's why I want get mine fixed. I don't even listen to the damned thing.
@PaperDosai so why aren't you playing now?
@PaperDosai Now we have 5 kids under 15 who have made it a habit of beating good players. Janul, Aabid, Vignesh, Thirandi and Radinka.
@PaperDosai That's Migara Jayasinghe. He is still around but doesn't play as often. Janul is from Royal.
@TheCitizen1 does that mean you are chucking out your Bavaria? Sell it to me!
@TheCitizen1 Hope you might be the one to tell me where I can get the LCD replaced on my Bavaria radio
@kattasambal I really appreciate that @TheCitizen1
@TheCitizen1 not my first job dude, my current job :)
@TheCitizen1 how about 12 hours a day Rs 0.00 per month for 2.5 years :)
@seniinthebox stop wearing one or the other
@Lishanw @SNSalgado but but they said crime will reduce since the underworld had strong links to the former regime and now it's severed.
@palinn most of those poeple probably have no experience and they were probably put on the list to make up the numbers!
I have taken various measures to reduce my environmental impact to compensate for the thirsty car + heavy right foot combo.
The little red car is very thirsty in the city. OTH if you drive it very gingerly the fuel economy improves but that would be pointless
@elmoQ have you tried staying up the whole night?
Nearly 26 but the little red car can easily accelerate through the S shaped, steeply inclined and stupid bridge while weaving past slowpokes
Common Table Expressions rock. Until you make a teeny mistake.
@kau_mad that would have been one hell of a paper then. Easy to pass but difficult to get an A. His favorite phrase was 'summa marks'
Very sad to hear that Prof. JNO has passed away. I still remember large chunks from his lectures of 15 years ago verbatim.
@seniinthebox actually I find it rather bumpy since they have relaid the tarmac in patches. a 50cm drop even 50 meters
@harshadewa oh for a moment I thought Sicilian Dragon
@sameerawim oh great! not many here I think. Is it a wagon?
@sameerawim you have a classic car?
@thameera mast branch was screwed up long ago now another branch has become the master.
Finally the git repo has a tag labelled v1.00
Halfway through the #CWC15 and I haven't watched a single match, didn't even need to check scores on Cricinfo cause everyone tweets cricket
@seniinthebox :)
@seniinthebox a yoga pants picture is obligatory.
@TheCitizen1 but @5a2a5i disagrees and got a K&amp;N filter, he should be able to tell you the place and the price.
@TheCitizen1 According to karu K&amp;N filter isn't all that hot for Sri Lankan conditions. Says a little bit of dust gets past the filter.
@TheCitizen1 don't even think of driving all the way to Colombo in it till you get at least 500-1000 km ticked off
@TheCitizen1 you mean to say the car has been lying idle all this time? Sad to tell you this but expect a lot of break downs.
@TheCitizen1 oh! great!
@TheCitizen1 your car?
13 year old Janul who beat the top two #scrabble players last week, just notched up a win against the #3 rated player. What a guy!
@kazZtr_ oh! maybe they have just changed the routes instead of cutting down the number of flights.  @sameerawim
A helicopter! They've become a bit of a rarity in this area since January.
@kazZtr_ ever tried their injector cleaner?
@NotJagath jealous haw!? @thameera
@Sansajran Yeah, I am no fan of the IUSF, but dammit, students need to have the right to cut lectures!
@5a2a5i then go and smell what you are shovelling.
@5a2a5i are you drunk?
@5a2a5i who is jealous of whom?
@Sansajran It's not a boycott. Since we dont' have a review system for lecturers there isn't a way to get them replaced.
@Sansajran because some lecturers don't know what the hell they are talking about and attending lectures makes you more likely to fail
@udendra @ravimendis in other sports also lots of Sri Lankans and Indians represent ME countries.

@erangatennakoon sorry you are right! it's only the town name that they have. @ZamanX90
@erangatennakoon what they fake mostly is the address so they can get one of the more popular schools. @ZamanX90
@erangatennakoon Don't also forget that people didn't complain to police over the last 10 years because they never took any action on any
@erangatennakoon I haven't a clue, but my stance is faked birth certifcates are wrong and they should all be arrested.
@erangatennakoon Well I would much rather everyone is arrested, but remeber, police need complaints before they can act.
@erangatennakoon Hundreds of thousands. Can't arrest them all but arresting a few will make people think twice about it.
@seniinthebox ministry types?
@cernoblog well this was the address they gave in the newspaper advert for RTI requests for comments.
@erangatennakoon guess you didn't get the memo about python 2 life time being extended to 2020 :-)
When a government ministry uses a gmail address it does not inspire confidence in that ministry or the government.
@cernoblog and what about you?
@kazZtr_ can't think of anything off hand, my car nut friend @5a2a5i will be sure to know
@janukz marking time.
@cernoblog that's a question that doesn't even need to be asked! @IzuTweets
@5a2a5i yeah! just imagine the wonders they could do if they had a majority!!
For the first time in at least 20 years, #lka cops have been arrested because someone died in police custody. Progress is slow but happens.
@Uduwaragedara @sarojpathi Good thing that hitler didn't get married until the last week of the war :-)
It's annoying that you still need quite a few lines of code to do simple upsert in postgresql
@HarshadeSilvaMP aren;t most of the houses in that area unauthorized?
Have the Weerawansa found themselves a 'Poya Day Magistrate'?
@NipuNee Indeed. They removed section of stupid extra lane which failed combat traffic towards borella but made other direction a nightmare
Hope @PMOIndia will exert his influence on the government of #Maldives to ensure that @MohamedNasheed get's a fair trial.
@officialunp @HarshadeSilvaMP also please do try to engage with the half starved youths of the villages who will fit 2 per chair.
@CharterKubiya exactly @Seductv
@CharterKubiya @Seductv beg to disagree, some of us were shocked and appalled but didn't speak out to avoid the same fate.
@Lishanw @PortelloFanatic OTH people at Uni hostels get on famously well with 2, 3 or even 4 to a room at times.
@PortelloFanatic oh that's decent.
@PortelloFanatic Other prob is that we don't have many studio flats in lk. If you move into a 1 room annex you are practically a prisoner
@PortelloFanatic Oh! I thought Kadawatha was quite expensive too. Perhaps you are speaking of &gt; couple of Kms from kandy road?
@PortelloFanatic dude you have no idea what rents are like in and around Colombo!
@muditha as for the how a 13 year old beat both the #1 and #2 rated players yesterday. Other kids also did well against high rated players
@e4c5 The venue is the Womens International hall in Guilford crescent
@muditha Didn't know you were scrabble Fan. The scrabbler of the year is a tournament held in four legs. First leg was played yesterday
Yesterday we had the Scrabbler of the year first leg. The WYSC players were hammering the seniors left right and center!
@muditha who is that?
@SueKiri the dredging started last year, #Yahapalanaya definitely should have stopped it.
Why are they dredging at Unawatuna? Is it because they want to destroy what little is left of that reef?
@muditha is that the cause?
@cernoblog my palanquin is naturally aspirated
It never ceases to puzzle me how a lovely green seaside town like Galle can be so bloody hot.
@TheCitizen1 actually those of us from Colombo think that Katugastota road is much worse than anything in Colombo.
@Rangi_Bungi30 All the under the table admissions screwed up (not that it will be stopped, just need to pay someone else )
@halfdoctor hm. Tweeting good stuff again :-)
@tingilye that particular buyout happened long ago neda?
@elmoQ you are telling me! Luckily my main bank account is a joint account with my wife (and even luckier still there's no money in it )
@KolithaBee yes the contractor's chief mason was an excellent worker but hated metric. Younger chaps were happier with metric though.
@KolithaBee you are right. I recall now that the blue print was in imperial but all the other drawings like strutural electrical were metric
Make the --follow option a default for git log  #yahapalanaya
@KolithaBee Oh didn't realize the construction trade still used imperial. WTH? Agree with your metric figures. :)
@KolithaBee Didn't know you are an American. We use metric here. And my understanding it it's 5 persons per square meter max
@KolithaBee and Nugegoda town center definitely isn't 60,000 square meters for it to be 300k crowd :-)
@KolithaBee as you have noted, I didn't say that. But calculating crowds is a science. All you need is to know the square area.
@rangaba the best way would be to find the area of the Nugegoda town center. You can pack about 4-5 persons per square meter
@PortelloFanatic In Sri Lanka there are lot of swing voters. People who vote for the side that is seemingly stronger.
@PortelloFanatic biggest plus point for the country is that (hopefully) RW will sit up and take notice.
@zrimax hm interesting.
@zrimax yuck
@zrimax CTB? :)
@Seductv I am glad to hear that but I do hope RW comes out of his slumber at least now.
@Seductv but the extent of road they are occupying is surely as big as Samanala grounds? BTW, do they still get CTB buses?
@Seductv woah! that's probably bigger than any MS had at Badulla, Beruwala or Galle
@ZamanX90 how many upright people we have lost like that!
@ZamanX90 What's he done?
Well @officialunp better sit up and take notice. Twiddle your thumbs for two more months and you will be in the opposition again
@alokag damn it!

@trappedalien oh rather undone, but environmental damage cannot be undone @Bwijenayake
@Bwijenayake @trappedalien as birders you guys would know how ecologically important Battaramulla is (or rather was).
@Bwijenayake yes still common in the dry zone that's why @KolithaBee  sees them often @trappedalien @Miyuruhansi missing from Battaramulla
@trappedalien we are destroying bird areas at an alarming rate and very few people seem to care. @Miyuruhansi @KolithaBee
@Miyuruhansi if the present trend continue it may be for the last time :( @KolithaBee
@Miyuruhansi @KolithaBee haven't seen one in ages. There used to be hundreds and hundreds of them around here.
So @mangalaS has managed to get the UNHCR report differed. Probably the single biggest diplomatic coup of the last ten years.
@KolithaBee actually it does, that's what all these talk of ethanol in the elections were about. Pure ethanol is dirt cheap.
@KolithaBee What i've heard is that like electronics, when you are buying in bulk there is a huge huge difference in price.
@KolithaBee 26 tractors also probably worth a lot of money.

@NotJagath Take your father to the labour commisioner
@dumindaxsb perhaps the move is in response to criticism that the def. minstry was given to an inexperienced person?
@udendra oops! didn't read :-)
@MEAIndia @vajirasumeda But why Perrier water?
@udendra oh golly are we going to get into a nuclear arms race against China? just so we can say no to the port city?
@Miyuruhansi I'll start teaching how to make Damascus swords (one school of thought says they were made in SL ) @InduNan @maranaya @zrimax
@InduNan but how as @Miyuruhansi points out it was outlawed. Revival is purely from drawings neda? @maranaya @zrimax
@gopiharan I have also been thinking of reactivating a blog that I took offline in 2008 or 9 for safety reasons but too lazy.
@Miyuruhansi @maranaya @zrimax Pardon the butt in, this Angampora isn't authentic right? It was lost during British rule but revived
@gopiharan why not reactivate your blog and write a piece in English?
@gopiharan do Sinhala and English daily still consider Jaffna to be another country or have they covered it too?
@officialunp @sajithpremadasa yawn. Time for some action.
@Lishanw People are already turning right towards Borella from that road (but didn't notice today (was to busy with the accelerator :)  )
@Lishanw Yes that's why I leave at that time, Six years ago it used to be 6:35 then 6:30 now 6:25 next year it will surely be 6:20
@Lishanw All the morons from Pelawatte cut across 3 lanes to enter the extra lane on the bridge. Then Merge back at Rajagiriya fuel station
@DJSlash9 :-) road.lk taken over by the government @PresidentGovLK
@Lishanw I leave home at 6:25 and travel to Collupitiya and return to Battaramulla.  So I experience it both ways and it totally sucks
Rajagiria extra lane segment between Diyawanna and Welikada discontinued with. And no traffic in Rajagiriya thank you @PresidentGovLK
@afthaj @malinthe this really does work. A friend of mine had one of the first batch of Prius in SL (round 2003). He replaced cells
@malinthe Laptop batteries are also like that. Sometimes they mark batteries as bad after n recharges but there's nothing wrong.
@AyeshaShehani Actually I founded this club. At uni I was famous for knowing the answer really when but writing some gibberish on the paper
@AyeshaShehani and utterly incomprehensible tweet by me. I meant : "If it makes you any happier, i am too"
@AyeshaShehani Talking to youself? You are the only one who is utter bored by it? If you make me any happier, I am too.
A moment of silence for all those who woke up early in the morning to watch the cricket.
@imthaz older ones do actually. I've heard of Becker radios from old Mercedes W123 and even W115 that still work 35-40 years later
@imthaz working as it's actually just the  LCD that's busted and the volume control knob is missing.
@imthaz Hi there, long time no talk, yes the car is also the same age. I think it's one of the last such working stereos in SL
Any suggestions as to where I can get a 26 year old car stereo repaired (No I don't want to replace it with a new one)
@alokag you didn't ask Sumanadasa or Chandrasiri before starting off?
@mhmhisham yep, but I am hopefully that the TNA will split and the moderates will become the major force
@malinthe been a while ne?
@rangaba @KolithaBee oh man!
@rebelinpurple I've been copped several times in a luxury German car, I think it's probably because the car is about 25 years old now.
Last night the dawg kept everyone and the neighbors up with continuous barking. Turns out a kitten and sneaked into the garage
@himalkk good good all the best
@himalkk is that your new gig?
@5a2a5i forget it you only see what you want to see. @NRSHQ @rangitha
@5a2a5i no government in History has destroyed trees and nature like the previous government. @NRSHQ @rangitha
@NRSHQ @rangitha why the hell is it that Colombo doesn't have a green belt? A policy on preserving or replanting trees?
@officialunp @HarshadeSilvaMP endless revelations but no action whatsoever
If govt is to persist with the failed Rajagiriya extra lane, please make sure bikers don't make 2,3 additional illegal lanes @PresMaithri
@DJSlash9 ah yes, on good days you can see Adam's Peak.
@DJSlash9 you in Trinco these days?
@DJSlash9 Aiyo na, I am actually feeling rather sympathetic towards Attanayake.
තිස්ස අත්තනායක ගොඩ පෙදකදොරුවෙක් අල්ලගේනලු නේද නඩු කියන්න
@muditha It's completely useless arguing with some people. There's none so blind as those who will not see
@MsAMR25 @mhmhisham an antic Luke that during Mr times would have meant dealing with a lynch mob
@NimanthieA @boredpumpkin in actual fact this is a reversion to the previous name. ( yeah but pres doesn't need to attend these ceremonies)
@zenrainman algae?
@BuduMalli well @ZackeyAhmed worked at president's office and was very zealous but the rest of the story is rubbish @sarojpathi
@Thesaint8x yep, obviously when they did it here they had more than 2/3. Our constitution is to be changed again not sure how though
@Thesaint8x more details about the system here: 
@Thesaint8x the PR system was introduced in SL when 59% of voters gave 80% of parliamentary seats to one party in the SL 1977 election.
@Thesaint8x time to introduce proportional representation maybe?
@KolithaBee did you do it?
@cernoblog @PriyaRaju AAP is going to pass the legislation allowing it
For the first time since 1987 I have absolutely no intention of watching even a single match in the Cricket World Cup.
@KolithaBee it's because we don't have enough trees
Sudarman was Deputy GM of ITN says @DMbreakingnews MD says @Mandana_IA news Director says @sandunarosha and @AzzamAmeen Confusing Noh? #lka
@DJSlash9 kiyala wadak na :( @gazly @EtisalatSL
@hirosht well now you do :-)
Eelections commisioner should note of how candidate's wealth, profession and qualifications are made public  
Delhi election results show why Proportional Representation is a necessary evil. 66 out of 70 seats won by AAP 0_0
Hope @PresMaithri will do something soon to protect trees before Colombo's green cover completely disappears.
@gazly sorry I thought I had pasted the link. 
@gazly see section 3 of the @twitter guideline particulary 3.c @DJSlash9 @EtisalatSL
@gazly that's what makes it possible for @EtisalatSL to send those spamy tweets. But it still violats the guidelines @DJSlash9
Dear @KaruOnline , why do you always address yourself as Hon. Minister Karu Jayasuriya? Shouldn'y you follow the president's lead?
@DJSlash9 exactly! Needs to ask before tweeting. And automated tweeting is not allowed @gazly @EtisalatSL @twitter
Dear @EtisalatSL are you aware that your #TPLSL vote spam tweets go against the @twitter api guidelines?
@pcranawaka so why no action?
@hirosht are you aware that some spammy app is sending a tweet through your account each morning?
@BuduMalli knowing  @ZackeyAhmed for a long time, I think this is lol worthy indeed.  @sarojpathi
@TheCitizen1 I think whoever wins learning chinese will be usefull
The Colombo Port City Project will not be cancelled. So let's take this  course on Coursera  
@KTheena they should be waterboarded.
@DJSlash9 So I take it you don't mind the Chinese being given 525 acres of land in Colombo?
@JustRuky @cernoblog I am hoping for the best and expecting the worst
@cernoblog The way RW is running the show it's a certainty that MR will return.
@DJSlash9 Let me clarify, I have always hated the people who handed large parts of the country to China on a platter.
Time since the bloodless revolution: 1 month
Number of kingpins from the former dictators regime arrested: 0
@HarshadeSilvaMP if super gains tax isn't socialism what is?
This tweet of @mhmhisham 
What was written about the Battaramulla marshes in 2006. Of course now there's no golf course but the result is worse 
@gayanhewa and I hope @KaruOnline  get's the message
But @KaruOnline , you can call it a donation if it's own money. I think you are using #lka tax payers money here.
@SueKiri my sympathies
@thameera exactly!
Temple in the town (1Km away) trying for force religion down our throats with the help of very loud public address systems.
@PortelloFanatic taxes
@sarojpathi is EFL still around? Thought GR had squeezed the life out of it
lovely rain. Not too heavy, not too light but just right.
@nkashokbharan yeah, I went to the link in your prev tweet, unfortunately I am unable to read tamil :(
@lahirunirmala I meant iff and only if
@nkashokbharan what's up?
Tax and spend isn't a bad thing iff taxing and spending is done sensibly.
@UpulTR (I don't know where the foreign ministry office is through) but we have too many ministries in this neck of the woods.
@UpulTR I am not a good communicator. Your call is probably terminating at a phone like mine. It's a common problem in Battaramulla
@UpulTR I get lots of calls to my landline asking if it's the foreign employment office. ( So I don't answer that anymore)
I whispered as loudly as I dared to at the time about the ship wrecks off Colombo 
Even if we disregard the EIA and economic feasibility for now, but what about a marine Archaeological survey? #askchampika #lka #portcity
Right to Information: We call on the @officialunp govt to publish the Environmental impact assessment (if one is availble) for Port city
@Lishanw yes there would be a penalty clause @5a2a5i but if it can be shown that laws were violated (eg enviorenmental) can avoid penalty
@5a2a5i that's the only explaination.
How on earth did the @officialunp govt has completed the EIA on the port city project so quickly? Or maybe they didn't?
@sarojpathi Never expected you guys to write headlines that are completely different from the content. @Cokroach
@hirosht @SvtG Playing on ISC?
@vajirasumeda please also tweet names so that people can avoid voting for such politicians who are only after portfolios at next election
TIL the TNA/TULF have been boycotting #lka independence ceremony since 1972 but yesterday @MASumanthiran and Sampanthan showed up.
Dear @officialunp , either take some action or stop this mudslinging.
@Seductv and Sumanthiran's
@Seductv looking at the independence day photos Mangala's tailor is probably the only one worth his salt
Wonder who RW's tailer is
@naveenmadhawa Baiyas are having a bad day it seems
@ExiledCaste the reality is that we need them to keep the pressure on the govt., to keep it from taking the same route the old one took.
@NotJagath sorry sir. never again @nMeeDiN @DulithK
@nMeeDiN @NotJagath සිරිකොතේ කොටි පේනවා, නිදහස් පක්ෂේ උප සබාපති පෙන්නේ නැ  @DulithK
@DulithK Ah you mean the peace accord that MR promised in his 2005 election campaign that he will protect and carry forward?
@nMeeDiN Actually I also feel very sorry for Tissa. Hope MS gives him a presidential pardon in the end. @DulithK @NotJagath
@DulithK who said it was ok? Why didn't MR file a complaint with the police? Still hasn't done. Remember police chief is still MR apointee
@DulithK so you are saying it's not a crime to forge documents. Thank you so I know where the rest of your statements come from.
@DulithK Did you say anything like this when SF was imprisoned by a kangaroo court?
@DulithK ah that reveals the reason why you voted for MR. You are a separatist.
@DulithK you don't think forging documents is a crime?
@rebelinpurple definitely a good move. Should implement for all religious places. Subsidized electricity should be done away with.
@rebelinpurple that would probably be unconstitutional too. But they can do small things like removing Buddhist flags from independence sqr
@mack005 oh never mind since you had named it thought it was yours. But people of your faith don't often keep dogs as pets right?
@erandawije do check if the prime minister is in a wheelchair and the police chief has fainted.
@mack005 another angle please. looks a bit like our dog too
The new president seems to be taking part in far more religious events than the old one. Can't we please have separate of church and state?
Good friends will take you a long long way. Take C.S Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien for example. Or Harper Lee and Truman Capote
@thameera @Malithsen hm but look what @LMAshton just tweeted 
@FahimFarook we still have a long long way to go
@FahimFarook maybe but should we move towards facts instead? And I don't quite know why Sinhala people are proud to be descendents of Vijaya
@FahimFarook i think so too but that's mythical.
Whether Panthera leo sinhaleyus ever existed has not been independently verified.
Is it a good time to ask why we have a lion in our flag instead of a leopard or an elephant?
@Malithsen @thameera something to really look forward to. But those 2million copies will be gone in a day.
For the first time in ages those of us from the south have something resembling independence. Northerners will have to wait a little longer
@malinthe probably
@malinthe nowadays diesels engines are usually turbo charged. It's very rare to find a naturally aspirated diesel
@hirosht and how is your other girlfriend's scrabble carrier coming along?
@BuduMalli republic in name only.
@sameera79 Isn't being remanded and reremanded and not being in hospital a big difference? @ShammasGhouse @Lishanw @ZamanX90
@sameera79 If the legal process is being followed nothing else is needed. Can be expelled if found guilty @Lishanw @ZamanX90
@Inthiqab93 Initially yes, but reremanded till the 6th @ZamanX90 @sameera79 @Lishanw
@sameera79 Like I said they will lose if they continue this. But for the record, Palitha was reremanded till 6th @Lishanw @ZamanX90
@Lishanw @ZamanX90 IMHO if RW doesn't take firm action against corrupt politicians the UNP will not win the GE
@ZamanX90 @Lishanw it will have to be that way possibly till the GE since RW doesn't have a majority in Parliament but needs 2/3s
@ahamednishadh supposedly the former but either way the person they are criticizing is their own boss :-)
@AHemmathagama so in other words SLFP debaters are attacking their own boss?
So far I haven't seen any minister or lapdog stockbroker claim an international or opposition conspiracy behinds the market's decline.
@alokag ah but did he yell the username as well
@nnulk @thameera 
@thameera A teeny bit yes
Haha, I've overtaken the national under 18 #scrabble champion at Facebook scrabble ratings! (of course it's a fluke he'd beat me 9/10 )
@ZamanX90 better to expand southwards where there are no natural boundries. eg nugegoda/cmb separated by tiny canal you can leap across
@ZamanX90 that's going to open a big can of worms since there is natural geographic boundary between CMB and Wattala
Good morning. We hope that it will be a low traffic day. Let's see how it pans out.
@pcranawaka why is it that no one has been arrested for corruption yet?
@Miyuruhansi @AyeshaShehani bring a Thanamalvila special
@mhmhisham @Dinouk_C sounds kind of like political suicide? Who is going to give him nominations for the next GE?
@milindat but now that navy will lose some 'serious ground support' and money possibly flowing back into CR and Kandy ...
@Dinouk_C @COOL_ARM that's from three weeks ago. Haven't still heard what happened next.
@alokag woah!
@samarajiva @NalakaG Batti. it was vandalize by some extremist group (can't remember which one)
The dawg still isn't used to having bats flying around inside the house. There are three of them today.
@SuaveRepublique yeah, they grow up  so fast.
@milindat is CR vs Kandy going to be the big show again?
Feeling sympathetic towards CSN? Just think back to the days when vehicles with CSN stickers were driven like they carried ministers
@gopiharan @halfdoctor @milindat exactly!
@halfdoctor in the old days you actually tweeted interesting stuff :)
@SuaveRepublique I don't see you talk about the gris now
If I am not mistaken J.R's father was also a justice of the supreme court.
Also a moment of silence for justice Mark Fernando who died in January 2009. He should have been chief justice in 1999 but CBK chose SNS
@NotJagath didn't know you had such big kids. How does this reconcile with your claim of being a virgin? @Rangi_Bungi30
For the first time since 1999 we have a chief justice selected on merit.
Image from an old blog post. The 2005 election wiped out nearly 30% of the CSE indices in a month. 
@Scrabbler89 doing fine thanks. I did guess that you didn't play as well as you could.
@CrazyPusa you have a very valid point.
@CrazyPusa yahapalane :( @rangaba
@CrazyPusa yes why only the elphants? The elphants are the only innocents here @rangaba
@MarianneDavid24 @tingilye good article as always but terrible photoshopping @FT_SriLanka
@Malithsen are you in US or liberia?
@DulithK  the constitution says any justice of the supreme court. JR also avoid the CJ. Maithri avoided illegal CJ @KaluMallii
@DulithK smell what you are shovelling. The govt has reversed an illegal appointment.
@DulithK exactly what the bayya made it.
Some baiyyas don't want the wage hike it seems. They should collect it and send to the maha baiyya he no longer has 96 billion to spend.
@DulithK so are you saying 1600 vehicles for one person is fair?
@DulithK yes, that's true. that tax is stupid and probably will be held as invalid by the supreme court.
@DulithK cutting 96Billion allocated for one person means the govt can do a lot of spending in other areas without increasing the income.
@DulithK to display all the things that the big Baiya fetched from us?
@DulithK Do you know how much a battered and bruised 1990s BMW e38 can fetch? 2 million. There are 1600 vehiles in the presidential fleet.
@RainforestSL the correct account is @PresMaithri
Did I miss a news item about the bar association being authorized to issue statements on behalf of the Ministry of Justice or the CJ?
@BuduMalli do you usually shower sitting down?
@ZamanX90 at the time of the design the rate was higher for 3,000+ houses and he was worried they might raise it higher.
@ZamanX90 by the type of visa. Beside when taking more than USD 10,000 you have to declare purpose.
@ZamanX90 migrating (or is it immigrating I always forget which is which)
@ZamanX90 definitely. My house isn't small but it's just below 3,000 sqft architect intentionally did it that way to avoid issues like this
@ZamanX90 actually no 5000 is very big. An ordinary single story house is &lt; 1500
@ZamanX90 no only if you moving out of the country permanently.
@meaningful precisely!
@ZamanX90 it's not the size of the land, it's the size of the house. AKA plinth area
@meaningful glad to know I am not alone
@CrazyPusa the role of the govt is to create a level playing field, not to arbitarily penalize a company because it's doing well!
Many old plantation bungalows would be over 5000 sqft. Tea companies can't even afford to paint them now much less pay 1M tax. #LKABudget
@alokag @suekiri colored glasses. Those friends of yours want UNP to win GE. (So do I but I don't think the end justifies the means)
Go forth and reproduce #LKABudget #lka
@alokag @SueKiri I don't think SLFP has anyone fitting the bill. We will have to turn to the TNA (JVP being far too let leaning)
@CrazyPusa how can it be fair? Why should a company that makes 2.1b pay 25% extra when a 1.95b company doesn't? @officialunp
@himalkk but they didn't have to stoop this law.
@alokag Not an expert but my understanding is you can't tax past income unless you have violated some law or have evaded paying due amount
@CrazyPusa @officialunp mansion tax, super gains tax, guaranteed purchase prices for a lot of things, arbitary one of taxes list goes one
@alokag @SueKiri not and expert on parliamentary procedure but in debates they do make amendments when implementation/legal issues raised
Guarantees price of Rs 350 for rubber? What the hell are they going to do with all that they buy stockpile it on Mattala runways?
@alokag yeah but still they should tackle it through legal means rather than this rubbish.
@umairwolid @SueKiri might pinch them a bit but for a company that already pays about Rs 1 billion a year it will not be a game changer.
@alokag but it will probably fail at the debate. If it doesn't I sure an unbiased supreme court would reject it.
@himalkk true but it has to be taken back legally as well.
@himalkk this wont stand. AFAIK you can't arbitrarily tax past earnings and/or  target just one company.
@TheCitizen1 out with the dull and the boring, in with the excitement. I suppose Kandy is safer for bikes than Colombo at any rate.
The budget started of well not it's beginning to sound facial. Is this really a @officialunp budget? Smells like MR at his worst.
@TheCitizen1 what about the e30?
@udithaumesh @NotJagath @thameera @rangaba money taken out of the country.
Super gains tax? Mansion tax? What rubbish is that? This budget is beginning to sound like something Sirima's govt might have presented.
@jehanj1977 would probably fit into that if you disregard the fuel price cut (which is anyway set off by lower oil prices) @Seductv
@TheCitizen1 what what?
Don't forget to thank MR for all these price reductions. It's the 96 Billion that he allocated for himself that's being used to cover them.
@Seductv is that a mispelling or intentional? fits either way @Fluffingcloud
@Fluffingcloud @Seductv Really? previous govt. assured us that loss of GSP+ had no impact and several industry leaders rushed to confirm it.
@dumindaxsb I belive it's called a periwig
Three CJs in three days? That's nothing. How about three Attorney Generals in one night? 


@LordPeterWimsey @PravNJ that's what they were counting on
@LordPeterWimsey @PravNJ could be could be. I am no fan of hers at all. It was impeaching a CJ that I was (silently) opposed to
@LordPeterWimsey sorry thread mixup on my part then
@LordPeterWimsey I vaguely recollect that you had some personal interest in the matter. Correct?
@LordPeterWimsey yes I remember all that hocus pocus, but she is supposed to resign immediately  ( I am not going to hold my breath)
@Mafazansar @ahamednishadh someone tweeted a link to the constitution article. Despite any defect in the judges the rulings stand.
@KolithaBee yeah like the few people I mentioned.
Now everyone can criticize the reappointment of CJ #43 but if MR had won and done the same thing, we would all have had to be silent.
Remember when CJ #43 was impeached illegally? only bar association, bishop Kanagasabay, JC Weliamuna and a few others dared to speak out
@KaluMallii but I see some girls also in those pictures
@udithaumesh from what I can see from my roof, it's well on it's way (can't actually tell whether people are working or not, too far away)
sorry bat, no bananas for you today.
@DJSlash9 yes we wanted to change the system where a president can use 1600 vehicles
Do the cops expect drug dealers to send AC payee checks to the politicians who protect them?
@sameera79 Well they don't need to enter the house to look for vehicles ne garden is enough :)
@sameera79 actually they are pretty decent about it. I know someone who had a visit. They didn't even enter the house.
@KTheena I've seen stigmata long ago but none of the others. The trouble is my old rocker friends are scattered around the world.
@KTheena I should have gone too. Please do tell me more about this place (I rarely go out but might make an exception)
@KTheena never seen them live. The den as in the club that Keerthi Fernando founded? Been to a Rattlesnake concert and 2 of venom.
Rattlesnake; one of #lka's pioneer rock bands. Sadly there's very little footage on FB. 
@mahesh9910 If you pass the bridge by 6:35 it's a completely different ball game (on any day).
@PriyaRaju why you no tweet links to blog posts?
@FahimFarook thanks. Must be on the dude's FB page. Will look it up
@FahimFarook um no. I don't watch TV
@FahimFarook with that person being the one that newspapers still don't dare to name :-)
let me get this right, #lka govt lends it's weapons to a private security firm which then leases them back to the country's armed forces?
So many #lka politicians passports impounded but no arrests. Why? @officialunp
@SueKiri @iFeelYouJohanna one it took me 1.5 hours from there to Kaduwela.
@ravimendis yes, you told me. It shouldn't hamper your citizenship application for SL citizenship? former prez was a highly dangerous person
@ravimendis might even be able to get dual citizenship now
Why isn't @BarackObama in #lka to look closely at the latest territorial addition to the United States?
@Lollipop_Kid Well I thought it was fairly obvious guess we are looking at it from different angles
The biggest problem with #lka cricket is the chief selector.
@TheCitizen1 today I read my father's paper. He also doesn't buy dailies anymore.
Almost tempted to start reading and even buying Sunday papers again. Maybe I will just get a few call options to begin with.
@erangatennakoon you are tweeting this stuff only because you are a die hard tennis fan right? :-)
@alokag this is the first time I heard it but googled and found it to be true. Shell life is only 2-3 months it seems.
yes @RubenThurairaj the great man  @Swamy39 even predicted that 60% of  Sri Lankan tamils will vote for MR
@alokag Performance is now much reduced. The mechanic came for another matter and after lot of searching he said aged petrol is the issue
@alokag The trouble is I don't use this car very much and keep the tank full to avoid rust (had fuel pump get toasted because of it)
@AyeshaShehani but the badge goes onto the fat part of the tie after grade 7 neda?
@AyeshaShehani that's your primary school tie isn't it?
@arvindjkv They probably were on something when the original recordings were done. But they were sober during the reworking.

@gsik thanks. Long time no talk how are things?
The petrol in my car dates from November. It has deteriorated badly. Any fuel additive that can prevent this?

@SueKiri lol Dayan Jayathilake? Sorry i don't have time to waste on such idiots. @ZamanX90 @sameera79
@Pamiya89 My sentiments exactly. However it turns out the guy is highly qualified, was a civil servant for years and was fired by MR in Nov

Oh and BTW a Bangle Butt would have cost at least USD 70,000 for a basic model. Long wheel base and fully loaded my guess USD 110,000
MR knows his cars. That's why this  Bangle Butt is the only one that he had covered. 
@DulithK Raththaran is that minister from Kaluthara.

@arvindjkv didn't know Dio played for Foo Fighters
@shiharaneez @Seductv would have bene better if that was only one escort but oh well, can't expect overnight changes.
@sameera79 So i have gathered. But interestingly confederate states had voted democrat. Now they are mostly republican! @ZamanX90
@ZamanX90 yes and in the US there were still the Indian Wars after the Civil War - perhaps the biggest crime ever commited by the US govt
@ZamanX90 After the surrender at appomatox there continued to be Guerilla bands raiding old enemies.
@ZamanX90 11 states seceded from the United States to create the confederate states of america. Slavery was one of the primary issues.
@ZamanX90 different time different story. Though the army under Gen Robert E. Lee surrendered, the militias did not.
@AHemmathagama yes now those cars are probably too far gone to be restored. @PresRajapaksa
@cernoblog @thegutterflower Yes, something like photorec can do it easily provided you have not saved anything to the drive after the loss
@DJSlash9 which is the typical defense by MR's fanboys when the massive corruption of this regime is pointed out. @SidathSam
@SidathSam @DJSlash9 5 years? I will tell you the real reason. Lot's of SL politicians were implicated in the Rajaratnam wiretaps.
Look at the number of BMWs and Range Rovers just rotting away 
@SidathSam @DJSlash9 I asked this before also but didn't get an answer: Why wasn't the case concluded? it's 5 years since Raj was jailed.
Oh my the dependencies required to compile bootstrap from less source.
@gopiharan time to take off the kid gloves
@Spooky_Flyer93 I don't know what universities are coming to nowadays. Tut tut.

1600 vehicles in the presidential fleet! More than 700 still missing. How many people were there in the former president's staff?
I was pretty disappointed by the president appointing his brother as SLT chairman. But it turns out the brother isn't a fuel pump attendant.
@thameera in US these days?

@Lishanw @binku @dumindaxsb I think they will be able to make another small reduction for the general election.
@erangatennakoon  tha'ts a Lamborghini :)
Even if the growth figures were correct they were boosted by  infrastructure projects where every cent flowed to China (or swiss accounts)
The high GDP growth rates the former regime touted is just rubbish. There were plenty of doubts about how CBSL did the calculations.
For 2 years the former regime tried to simulate the economy with rather dramatic rate cuts. Didn't work. The new govt fuel price cuts might

@Shailendree In this case it's just the tip of the iceberg. Sadly many will be unproven because CID, Bribery commision all made incompetent
So the raid on the floating armory was to check for missing weapons. Why couldn't the govt say that immediately and avoid all the confusion?

@KolithaBee lol you know know why it happened but you are justifying it? @ZamanX90 @CrazyPusa
@Lishanw @ZamanX90 yes you are right we hosted two of them.
@CrazyPusa it would be an international conspiracy. @kolithabee @zamanx90
@ameenizzadeen @Apelankawe it cost USD 210 million to build. Sri Lankan alone losed USD 18 million landing there, so yes let it rot.
@KolithaBee and continue the great Sri Lankan tradition of taxing A in order to subsidize B @CrazyNalin
@ZamanX90 the last one who did visit was struck with a rifle butt
@CrazyNalin at that time imports almost completely banned. it still didn't work out too well @KolithaBee

@KolithaBee @CrazyNalin that works at the moment thanks only to huge tax concessions
@KolithaBee building cars in a small country like this? It's one of the toughest businesses in the world @CrazyNalin
@CrazyNalin @KolithaBee certainly not what one wants to hear from a learned man like him.
@ZamanX90 the joys of being a student
@ZamanX90 that expensive?
@pcranawaka still wondering why there haven't been any arrests though lots of goods have been seized.
@KolithaBee and I think the generalization is valid :-)
@JustRuky yes let's await @pcranawaka 's next move
@ZamanX90 @kazZtr_ abandoned probably because he would have trouble explaining how he could afford a USD 100k car.
@JustRuky yes, plenty of stuff but no persons. Besides those 68,000 clocks were probably destined for the dustbin anyway @pcranawaka
@SNSalgado what about all the pesticides in salads?
@KolithaBee all gossip sites are the same
@skwijeratne the plain in it's present condition is junk, but it's historically very important.  @Seductv @pcranawaka
@KolithaBee @muna I am definitely not a fan.
#LKA anti corruption arrests: 60,000 bottles of booze. 68,000 Wall clocks. 1 car. 1 plane. 8 ordinary people. 0 politicians.  @pcranawaka
@muna @KolithaBee even the Sathosa method would far superior to the MR method.
@KolithaBee excellent move. Roads should be built only after proper EIA and construction cost should be transparent.
@DJSlash9 this is not a secret service. This is a purely commercial and very public operation. Just google for Indian Ocean floating armory.
@DJSlash9 I am not sure why they raided it either but there's no way anyone can be endangered by it.
@DJSlash9 contrary to what the local press is saying that armoury is not a top secret operation. There are about 50 of them
@Scrabbler89 Good show. too bad about that tied game.

@AyeshaShehani not heavily effected by inflation then. As I remember those days it was 35
@AyeshaShehani how much is it now?
@chanux the question I think is whether it made any money for the country. But as usual cops and journos have totally bungled it.
"Floating arsenals: The boats full of guns for hire against pirates"


@Seductv thanks. Guess a few journos are going to have egg on their face.
I am not an expert on Lamborghinis but that car sure doesn't look like one.
@JustRuky have no fear they arrested 8 drivers and helpers with the Dematagoda hooch @chanux
@chanux yes former SBS (SL version) was also said to be in on it. @JustRuky
@Lishanw @chanux
@chanux public secret was what I heard. SAS types are often hired by ships that travel through the worst effected areas.
Is it the famous floating armory That supplied weapons to ex-commandos that ship owners sometimes hired to protect against pirates?
@UpulTR I have noticed that in all your arguments with me and others you invariably restort to similar tactics when you dont' have answers

via @indica on @ndtv Tweets.
#fb
@erangatennakoon I deleted a lot of tweets in 2010 :-) what I said wasn't recorded (I think)
@UpulTR facts that are not compatible with your flowed logic you mean? in MR's govt 75% of budget was for him and basil.
@UpulTR you on the other hand think it's perfectly legitimate for MR to treat the treasury as his personal bank account.
@UpulTR like I said if you take off your colored glasses you will see the reality. I have complainted often enough about RW's inaction
@UpulTR excuse me, it was your beloved Mahinda who gave though corrupt politicians ministries after 2005. Why didn't he jail them?
@UpulTR As usual ignoring facts to suit e your point of view. Cutting security and other staff, vehicles, office space is a huge saving
@UpulTR Ok, whoever, but why did MR give cabinet ministries to people who engaged in corruption before 2005 instead of jailing them?
@UpulTR security was a total waste, but I see that you have not read the rest of my tweet where I point out the other wastefull things
@UpulTR every minister had a fleet of vehicles and army of guards + servants. Those numbers are reduced drastically. Same for office space
@UpulTR It's all RW's fault. He is dragging his heels. Some of the old cases cannot be investigated due to statute of limitations (MRs fault
@UpulTR so you think it's wrong to expose MR's daylight robbery?
@nalu_batta @kazZtr_ it's the fine art of disinformation. Ranil's war crimes and autonomy comments are classic examples.
@alokag time is not on his side. In three months he may even lose the leader of the opposition post if he fails to act @FahimFarook
@FahimFarook @alokag well even RW's opponents say he is not corrupt so why doesn't he act?

@DJSlash9 sorry wasn't asking about RW's foot in mouth disease, was asking about Hon. Dr. Mervin Silva's allegations @Thizuu
History repeats. In 2003 @RW_UNP could have acted strongly against corruption but didn't. Now he is making the same mistake again.
@ChirathV @PodiMalli Was
@Thizuu @DJSlash9 are those allegations true?

@BhathK but the big question is will it happen? What were the deals made on the 9th morning and yesterday?
@RubenThurairaj @ExPresRajapaksa still a waste, let the jungle reclaim it and punlished should still be meted out
@KTheena oh yes, must remember to cast a vote of gratitude at the next election
Mattala was once a beautiful green jungle. 2000 hectares were bulldozed for an airport that no one wanted. This deserves a life sentence
@erangatennakoon Do tell how a profit can be made on it? So many flights were landing each day with no one boarding or disembarking
@erangatennakoon both are huge losses. Keeping them would be the equivalent of holding on to a dud stock during a long bear market.
@umairwolid @milindat Not quite sure if vigilantism was the change that was promised
@erangatennakoon better than pouring more money into a black hole. At least we can cut our loses
quoting the new minister of aviation @vajirasumeda says Mattala will not close. Damn. Damn . Damn.

@udendra let the jungle reclaim it.
Even if this govt doesn't do anything else I will vote for them again for ending the war on nature 1st step. cancel flights from Mattala
@kazZtr_ guilty!
@himalkk definitely will happen unless he can get a solid majority at the general election (which still seems rather unlikely)
@himalkk thought he is not corrupt he is too lenient with those who are totally corrupt. Remember the BMW scandal?
@himalkk and he is already making the same sort of mistakes that was the hallmark of this 2002 premiership.

There were at least 20 flags per kilometer on the expressway for #PapalVisitSL , I am sure the pope would not approve of such waste.
@SueKiri that might be the route from Baudhaloka mawatha to Peliyagoda (of  course I could be completely wrong :-)
Judging by the Vatican flags on the #E3 that would be the pope's route to St. Benedicts

Dear newspapers, you lost readers to gossip sites because of your self censorship. Stop doing that at least now.
@CinnamonGrandC delighted to hear.
@Hiru_Cullen slightly off the mark. For every expectant mother. @TheCitizen1
@sameera79 a case of what goes around comes around.
@PlainTeaGirl @CrazyPusa @Hiru_Cullen @KGisLife cabinet 27 total number including State and Deputy is 47. MR Cabinet 55 total 97
@CinnamonGrandC appreciate what you did. Hope the plastic cups were disposed properly or better recycled.
@umairwolid @JustRuky probably will not be false :-)
@readmelk that is statistically incorrect. If you use that yardstick you need to include the hashtags that you have excluded @SiripalaBot
@readmelk  those are not separate opinions or comments just noise @SiripalaBot
@readmelk since @SiripalaBot only retweets, that account should be removed from the analysis
as you know @himalkk , I too am a non believer but a big fan of the pope
@Lishanw I guess the only thing to be investigated now is a matter of tax evasion. But really hope the plane is restored and preserved
Sri Lanka does not have this many catholics. Some of those people are buddhists, hindus and muslems + atheists like my friend @himalkk
@Seductv remember invitations were actually sent by MR's govt.
@RubenThurairaj to my grate shame I cannot speak tamil and google translate didn't handle that too well. @asanka_1987 @JustRuky
@Lishanw Is that really his plane? Then it should be sent to  the Rathmalana aviation museum
@asanka_1987 @JustRuky deja vu? or is a story planted counting on people to forget the previous arrest for the same offense?

@Lishanw wonder if the detective will be transferred and the container will suddenly go missing.
@Lishanw I was also sceptical at first, seems it's helicopter parts + small plane there were photos
@boredpumpkin but a plane not a copter
@boredpumpkin oops it's true!!

@Sansajran @CrazyPusa @erangatennakoon The president doesn't even have A/L (because he is said to be illegally imprisoned in his A/L year)
@SueKiri yes cancelled meeting with bishops even.
Pope near by swarnavahini nw 
@vajirasumeda typical Sri Lanka @BuduMalli @rangaba
@vajirasumeda @BuduMalli @rangaba It looks like he is going in an ordinary car?!
#BanAstrologyInSL
This moron should be arrested for bringing #LKA into disrepute 
@cernoblog probably a lot of both.
@anthonylk2005 I think both MS and the Pope would rather they didn't. They already had a function at the airport.
@PlainTeaGirl that's temple trees he was speaking of @KolithaBee
The pope would much rather meet poor people or visit hospitals rather than spend time with politicians. #PapalVisitSL
It's clear that the #papalvisitsl schedule was made by the MR govt. A meeting at president's house a state function at BMICH yike
@cernoblog haha, must of full of theory but no practical experience @KTheena
@KolithaBee But don't know if MS has a house in CMB. JR and SWRD did. Still using one official residence is better than using two right?
@KolithaBee :) can't say for sure though. JR and SWRD mostly used the official residence only for ceremonies. So let's see if MS does same
@KolithaBee yes, Ranil might move in, MS will probably go to the president's house
@KolithaBee Temple trees is actually the PM's residences. The president's house is the one in Fort. MR used both.
@lakshanz @indica and state ministers aren't new. They've been around since Premadasa days and prev govt had plenty of them too.
@KTheena and those suits in this sun.
@PriyaRaju if his bullet proof vest is anything to go by, he is definitely pro india. We know that Ranil W definitely is.
I bet those harmless looking guys hanging onto the popemobile are some of the best fighting men in Switzerland
@PriyaRaju I still remember how you advised me and @mjmmanoj to be discrete!
@PriyaRaju not just the tamils we all are. MR supporters are severely critical of MS. In past elections the losing side just shut up.
@PriyaRaju by elections?
@gopiharan I think they invited him but didn't come.
@erangatennakoon could be. Hakeem is supposed to mean medicine man, doubt if Rauf is one :-)
@SueKiri No i really meant that Italy which I believe is responsible for overall defense of the Vatican will declare war on SL
@erangatennakoon wasn't there a Moulavi in parliament now (or was that just his name and not his role?)
@gopiharan what's the bet that HH doesn't like it either?
@SueKiri Italy will declare war
@bfonseka @groundviews maybe protocol requires the presence of the CJ? Maybe that's why the person didn't resign yet (wanted to be there)
@boredpumpkin just shows what a small mind these racists have. @himalkk
MT @himalkk: @e4c5 @minzy34 Same. Atheist here and I would love to see the pope up close.
@himalkk I am tempted to put up a Vatican flag now
@minzy34 I am an atheist and I think he is totally cool.
@AHemmathagama oh! didn't know that. When did it happen?
Someone has edited the cabinet of sri lanka wikipedia page without arching the old one 
@AHemmathagama wasn't it 67 in the cabinet? I remember that figure being quoted during the campaign
@muditha according to that stat a worthy appointment
@boredpumpkin only a few hours left ne?
@PlainTeaGirl that's where MR went wrong.
@PlainTeaGirl thanks. Hopefully no more ministries.
@Seductv I can remember the bomb that killed him but not whether he was state or not. Did Ranil's 2002 govt have anything like it? @udendra
@udendra thanks. That's what I also thought (at least on defense ) but @Seductv says it's not automatic. Confused.
@mahesh9910 pretty similar but state ministers can't attend cabinet meetings
No sports ministry? What about all the governing bodies registered with the ministry? Now can two organizations claim to be the authority?
@tingilye well he is not even in parliament :)
@chanux another of his pets like Gonston etc?
@chanux but as with foreign affairs anyone should be able to do a better job than the last guy who had edu. That must be MY3's logic :)
@Seductv thanks! I thought it was auto. @Me_ArunR
@CrazyPusa not sure of the exactly number of state + deputy but I recall reading during the campaign that it was 67 cabinet
@Seductv ah yes, that's what I also was discussing with @Me_ArunR  that's the usual thing ne. President automatically gets defense
In addition to a cabinet of 67, the last government had about 40 state + deputy ministers. MR himself may have lost count.
@Seductv you mean reserved for SF? But SF can enter parliament unless Arjuna or Katagoda resign? @Me_ArunR
As I recall last govt had 67 Cabinet ministers so this is a big improvement even though slightly over the promised number
@Me_ArunR aiyo nothing to appologise about.
@CrazyPusa unfortunately yes.
@Me_ArunR Isn't the minister of defense is by default the president? I don't ever recall such an appointment
@CrazyPusa When there isn't a cabinet minister for the same thing yes.
@CrazyPusa more than that. THey have a full ministry but don't get to sit on cabinet meetings.
All right guys admit it, we went overboard too soon about SLFP #postelection crossovers. None of them got cabinet posts. Sorry #MY3
Ok, now we've got quite a few ministers whose names I have never heard of. That probably means they are not worthy :-)
@himalkk @Lovely_Paba yes, he was pretty good. Actually all the ministries he held in the past he did a good job.
@rebelinpurple @tingilye you were right
@Apelankawe @KTheena serious omissions but  TNA has declined a cabinet position let's hope Rosy, Digambaran and Thalatha will get deputy
@boredpumpkin with most fish it's actually quite easy to tell the head and tail apart
Mangala has the easiest job of them all. Things are so bad at the foreign ministry, anything will be considered an improvement
@erangatennakoon without doubt this will be the worst appointment in this cabinet
@SueKiri that was his father according the UNP. RaviK according to the SLFP @rebelinpurple @tingilye
@rebelinpurple @tingilye no different from CBK or MR cabinets then.
@tingilye @rebelinpurple is it ports or sports for Ranatunga?
@erangatennakoon @NandikaBeddegam far from being the first. In fact this was the norm in the old days.
@muditha I took a course on cousera once but have forgotten much of it
@muditha any SL university teaching game theory as a subject?
@excuzemi how did you find a photo of a smiling RW?
@binku he is from Batti @rebelinpurple @PlainTeaGirl
@DJSlash9 that's what we are trying to change, not just the seats. But these moves will strengthen the UNP. Harin, Oneshot already fighting
@DJSlash9 my main concern was to replace the known devil with a lesser evil, so in that regard I am still up on the deal.
@DJSlash9 not me my friend. You would have seen my tweet but withdrawing support yesterday I hope.
@officialunp I really wish you would tweet this stuff before newspapers did.
@CrazyNalin @himalkk list available?
@himalkk @Mandana_IA #filesgate
From the pics i've seen, this protests at supreme court looks stage managed very like the ones that MR used to specialize in.
@himalkk it's the subservient mentality, even if the boss doesn't ask for it they display it
@chanux maybe but in this case the south will be more like the north ;-)
@Vindi_B @udithaumesh there's still a medium sized one of #MY3 at Rajagiriya. Hope it will be taken down soon. All others gone.
So what next? A separate state for Monaragala and Hambantota of #LKA ?
@zrimax I know I know! I hate repetition too.
@Mandana_IA Wayamba I think.
@zrimax not the change that we asked for
@alokag yes we are honored @FahimFarook
@FahimFarook we probably wouldn't survive a day in a pradeshiya  sabha. Heck I can't even cope with office politics.
@FahimFarook you are right. he needs to get the majority and looks like it has to be by hook or by crook :(
ආතල් එකට පෝස්ට් එකක් හැදුවා. කව්‍රුත් සීරයස් වෙන්න එපා හරි 
@TChanaH @JustRuky @TheCitizen1 @alokag true. Majority of MY3 supporters are critical. MR supporters never criticized or accepted criticism.
@JustRuky you are talking sense. I suppose sometimes unholy alliances are required @TChanaH @TheCitizen1 @alokag
@TChanaH @TheCitizen1 @alokag @muditha your wait and see advice seems to be right! SLFP even seems to have two central committees
@muditha ok, let's wait and see then.
@TheCitizen1 @alokag @TChanaH hm, ok I will follow your advice and keep quite. Let's see how it goes.
@alokag @TheCitizen1 But can't really support a govt full of these opportunists. I will however never become a MR supporter. Rest assured.
Looks like it's time to withdraw the support I extended to #MY3 and cross over to the opposition.
@nMeeDiN @nalu_batta I think බඩු ප්ලේස් එකක් means something entirely different.
@lankanfarmer @KazGirl20 @KaluMallii 
@KazGirl20 @lankanfarmer @KaluMallii that was a catholic bishop in US if I am not mistaken. They've been having female priests for a while
@lankanfarmer so it's only the Buddhist temple and the mosque that's not progressing. @KazGirl20 @KaluMallii
@lankanfarmer India recenly appointed their first Anglican Bishop and so did england (ms Libby Lane). @KazGirl20 @KaluMallii
@KazGirl20 @KaluMallii yes I know. If lord Buddha knew, he would be horrified.
@KazGirl20 Lord buddha believed in equal rights for men and women. So it's not a religious belief. @KaluMallii
@KaluMallii @KazGirl20 yes to both. In the 1990s Sri Lanka was even more sexist than it's now.
@PlainTeaGirl very unlikely it's been thought this far. This is nothing more than back room jockeying by SD and his backers in coalition.
@gsenev lol that's a plant designed to invoke exactly the feeling that you just had.
@PlainTeaGirl let's chase him out.
අපිට එපා සෝමරත්න 3000 likes and counting. 
@erandawije Agreed. People didn't and still don't believe SF's coup attempt because there were far too many conspiracy theories by MR.
@erandawije oh by the way several credible journals like the Sunday Times have now carried that military coup story we discussed. @SueKiri
@TheCitizen1 hopefully @RamanayakeR will at least see the email alert that he gets for the mention and do the needful
@RamanayakeR will you be so kind as to disconnect your twitter account from your facebook page? Thanks
@erandawije @SueKiri in 2010 critics went silent even before the results were fully released. I and some others deleted tweets.
@KTheena I hope you are right.
@KTheena I thought rugger was worse but I suppose the point is debatable. CWC is going to be an early exit.
Anyone agree that next to rugby, cricket is the most politicized sport in #LKA ?
Good morning @pcranawaka , @officialunp have you noticed how everyone is so utterly disappointed by the new govt's choice of SLRC head? #lka
@nHiRanZ @ShammasGhouse Self destruction? You kidding? That has received a loud cheer from some quarters
@SNSalgado Pink Floyd isn't really the band to listen to at times like that
@binku you are an exception. Since the 8th the traffic has been in the other direction
@chanux so you think we should go back to not naming names? just in case?
@mayooresan @mnshabri I hope (but don't expect ) that these videos will open more eyes
@DJSlash9 sometimes evidence has to be presented but yes, too much evidence will work in their favour @Rathgamaya
@mnshabri @mayooresan don't be too sure, he has swung many of the swing voters back towards himself in the last 48 hours.
@asanka_live nopes. As @HarshadeSilvaMP and others have pointed out. This is not correct. SF is not even in parliament.

@5a2a5i from the only TV channel that you trust 
@RamanayakeR shouldn't people like you put pressure on HE to make sure that SLRC  chair goes to a worthy person?
@PortelloFanatic no
@PortelloFanatic use the word discuss in a tweet only at the risk of sounding like a social media guru.
@cernoblog well that's what made me stop worrying when that story that Rajitha made public today was doing the rounds on the grapewine
@PaperDosai indeed. I still remember deleting my tweets in a hurry in 2010
@gopiharan as I recall he used call dissenters as terrorist.
Don't lose the voter's trust on day 1 by appointing Somaratne Dissanayake as SLRC head @MaithreepalaS @RW_UNP
@ZackeyAhmed the only purpose seems to be to promote separatism.
@rebelinpurple I think @MaithreepalaS will do it but it's too early to tackle it. Will only give more fuel to the racists ATM.
@ZackeyAhmed never thought you would RT what one of the LTTE accounts has tweeted
@arvindjkv ok then I will bookmark it @Seductv
@Seductv thanks. Hope interpol is called in. This was on gossip sites but wanted hear from a reliable source @Rathgamaya @rangaba
@Shenuminator @Im_Musfik unlikely to be accurate. SF cannot be a minister he is not in parliament and hasn't been pardoned yet.
@rangaba Did he say if any attempt made to prevent it? Was it before or after the election results? @Rathgamaya
@CrazyPusa horrible move
@udendra definitely the most worthy, but only 25 cabinet seats available neda?
@KolithaBee it is necessary to be a parliamentarian to hold a ministry.
@Seductv @arvindjkv just curious; who is running that site? Hope it's a neutral entity.
@KolithaBee she is not in parliament and I don't think she will get even a provincial council ministry. But hopefully she will get justice
@Seductv @AHemmathagama Thanks for confirming. I actually heard this on the grapevine on the 8th but that site wasn't well known
@sameera79 SL courts behave in strange ways. Once SB was hauled up in court and the key witness a cop changed his story! @CrazyPusa
How much of this is true? 
@mhmhisham @NMJaufer @BuduMalli how about just #100days cause it should be as short as possible.
@CrazyNalin lankacnews accessible from here. (SLT) last updated at january 10, 11:20 am @mhmhisham
@CrazyNalin I know I only visited to keep an idea about what the opposite side is saying and doing. Hope MS doesn't block it @mhmhisham
@isura @mhmhisham fire him!
@CrazyNalin @mhmhisham was lankacnews ever blocked? I remember visiting it once or twice in December?
@isuru71 very likely to be 600,000 , that 6000 figure is rubbish. What about all those cars, generators, displayes security
@sameera79 it was a dream for many of us to get rid of the dictator, so maybe her dream will come true @JustRuky @TheCitizen1 @himalkk
@TheCitizen1 I don't think the numbers are sufficient without SLFP and in a national govt SLFP should be included  @sameera79 @himalkk
@sameera79 even though the sight of her I really hope she succeeds @himalkk
@himalkk With MR firmly in control of SLFP a parliamentary majority needs JVP and all other small parties to vote with MS and RW
A forgotten fact is that ITN was a pioneering TV station co founded by RW's brother. It was taken over by JR's government
@alokag unfortunately many people wont see it that way. I have lots of friends with msc, mphil and even phd still rooting for him.
@FahimFarook my feeling exactly.
Do you get the feeling that #MR's uncharacteristic departure without a scrap on the 8th is part of a plan to return as Prime Minister? #Lka
@ravimendis I for one sure hope to see @RW_UNP flying off to see Kerry. Nothing can be done without US help @TChanaH
@FahimFarook we now have to put on the seat belt and hold on! @alokag
@skwijeratne @RainbowRevo @Seductv not a big fan of the JHU but they are at least  a bit better than the BBS et al
@skwijeratne @RainbowRevo @Seductv yes that's definitely his vote base. Let's hope some of them swing behind JHU.
why the hell is this stupid ITN following me? (reaches for the block button). Oh wait it's only @Rathgamaya
@alokag in that case the ride will be bumpy. Without SLFP control no majority in parliament.
@mjmmanoj cheers mate. Haven't forgotten how you fought the good fight in 2010.
@alokag ah but you forget that MR's chief weapon - handing out ministries is now in MS's hands ( I hope he uses it wisely)
@alokag I think CBK + MS combo can easily wrest control of the SLFP now and that will make things difficult for MR
@udendra yes, looks like poorly planned
Wasn't that a major security lapse? The president and PM could have been crowd crushed to death within minutes of being sworn in.
@PortelloFanatic DPL invitees @TChanaH
@chapa_perera91 JR had at Dalada Maligawa it seems @Miyuruhansi
@dumindaxsb The story i heard had this + RW negotiating with army brass to assure no purges like what happened in 2010 @FahimFarook
@Rathgamaya ah! I think it's obligatory to invite all parliamentarians for the swearing in.
@Rathgamaya why what happened?
@harshadewa let's allow @MaithreepalaS to start from tomorrow. He must have a lot of sleep to catch up with.
Votes for Maithripala in 10 districts MR won -  2,565,801.

ඔය පාට පාට සිතියම …
@Lishanw for the die hards you mean?  @ZamanX90
@takashiG but your tweets are really RT worthy
@takashiG at the rate I am tweeting, if I mixed in your tweets as RTs, i'd prolly be suspended by twitter or blocked by other tweeps
@SueKiri That's a big improvement. There was just a Buddhist flag during the previous regime (no Sri Lankan flag).
@muditha @takashiG I think there's hope. One of my tweets in the wee hours about northerners being enfranchised got retweeted about 15 times
@FahimFarook @dumindaxsb my feelings exactly. MR supporters usually assume guilty until proven otherwise. Should be do the same?
@takashiG space the tweets out will ya? I also wanted to RT some of your stuff but couldn't while shooting my own mouth off @muditha
@Lishanw oh sorry. sometimes irony and sarcasm is wasted on me
@ZamanX90 I think he left well before the final result was out. Dahanayake apparently took the bus well before midnight @Lishanw
@Lishanw prolly a fabrication ne? He has already left, and yes it was really rotten for CBK to have overstayed.
@dumindaxsb oops sorry. I replied from the wrong account.
@dumindaxsb sorry should have phrased it better. Search and replace the term AG with the term "Armed forces commanders" in that story.
Swearing in with justice Sripavan instead of the CJ is a great move. One of the biggest problems for MY3 is how to tackle the position of CJ
@PortelloFanatic I think i know of whom you tweet. He wasn't like this an year ago.
Can we all get together and persuade @MaithreepalaS to privatize ITN, Rupavahini, Lakehouse and SLBC? #lka
@TheCitizen1 @muditha @Rathgamaya oh all three of you weren't perfect but close enough :-)
Ranil bashers please note that it was RW that MR called for discussions about transfer of powers (and no doubt his security).
Now it's over. I must appreciate the unbiased awareness campaign carried out by @muditha ,  @Rathgamaya , @TheCitizen1 and others
@skwijeratne @Seductv unfortunately the people who voted for MR are spinning that has totally bad thing.
@himalkk your neck of the woods right? (and guess it's not going to be the landslide I predicted)
@SNSalgado let me assure you that it's just you.
@DJSlash9 I was happy from the moment the first set of results (which MR won) came. That made the end result a forgone conclusion. @DulithK
@DulithK big change isn't it? 20,000 extra votes for MR in 2005 only 4500 this year 0_0
@PaperDosai sorry to hear. There would have been thousands of other tweeting similar in 2020 if he had won again
@zenrainman yes but the story on the ground is that the final result was known to the president long ago.
@InduNan remember what we voted for was a change, so let's hope they don't say "මහත්තය මාරු නැද්ද?"
@erandawije maybe. As usually happens in SL we will never know the truth. I don't think the new regime will change that one either :)
@InduNan I do hope that MR is still given a prominent role. It's only fair @pontifex
In other news, Sri Lanka's tea industry might just be saved since Thonda's stranglehold appears to be well and truely broken.
@zenrainman yep yep!
@erandawije You think that's SF own doing? hm
@erandawije this is apparently post election stuff according to the grape wine. That's apparently how RW prevented the rumored intervention
@erandawije RW has apparently assured the army that SF will not be allowed to the same kind of purges as Gota did.
@Rathgamaya Not all those over 25 are bad you know :-)
@PortelloFanatic yes with a big increase in the number of votes
@himalkk mark my words mate, it's a landslide. in 2005 MR had 62% of the postal votes. Postals are usually pro incumbent at every election
@himalkk the best as they say is yet to come. The first few postal results (which MR won) paradoxically indicate a landslide for MS
@TheCitizen1 Kandy sure to be a thumping win. Kurunegala probably a close call.
@_Sum_1 highly unlikely that they will be able to eat into this lead.
For the first time since 1977 the voices of the people of the north have been heard. Southerners forget that they are citizens too.
So far I have seen four different unofficial figures for Pollonnaruwa postal votes.
In other news, switched on the TV earlier today after more than an year, only to find the damned thing doesn't work.
@DJSlash9 I am more than prepared to delete tweets once again :-)
I myself happen to be a latecomer to the 2015 bandwagon. Not so in 2010 (but I (and many other like me) had to delete all those tweets)
There will be a lot of people bashing MR from tomorrow. Please note that lot of people were doing that at great risk for quite a while.
I want to say this before the results are out: How come president's astrologer has six elephant's tusks? (As reported in NYT)? It's illegal
@elmoQ you know something we don't? @dumindaxsb
@udendra thanks for the info. Isn't that rather unfair? Well I suppose it's the rule
What happens if you were standing in the queue at the polling station when the clock struck 4:00 do you still get to vote?
@shareek_hy sorry to hear. I wish for her to recover her health.
@JustRuky those things will have zero impact.
@shareek_hy you should have asked for special facilities for grandma. Then no need to queue up.
@Musathik nearly an hour. Neighborhood political activist said 90% turn out in our neck of the woods!
@Musathik ගොඩක් වෙලා හිටං හිටියද?
මම නම් ලසියෙන් පෝලිමේ ඉන්නේ නැ. එත් අද පැයක් විතර හිටන්  ඉඳල, ගස් වැල්  වන සතුන් වෙනුවෙන් ජන්දය දැම්ම හරිය
Going out in a short while to cast my vote on behalf of the trees, rivers and wild life.
@PlainTeaGirl hang on a sec you've not been living here all this time?
@himalkk oh damn! yes will send
@Shailendree my daughter was in School in 2009 can't really remember anything like that.
@Lishanw I didn't say schools were never closed i said weren't closed for long periods because of bombs @Shailendree
@Shailendree Yeah, lots of holidays, but funnily enough I can't seem to recall  schools ever being closed for long due to bomb threats.
@Shailendree woah that was in 1989. I remember being home for a few months at the time. Didn't realize we were of the same age group :-)
@kau_mad @thameera @pahans @NisansaDdS @akila87 Interestingly Ranil's wife is a lecturer at Kelaniya. She was there long before marriage
@kau_mad @thameera @pahans @NisansaDdS @akila87 thankfully I left long before UoC was politicized to this extent
These astrologers are making the rest of the world see our countrymen as being utterly stupid. 
I tell yah, Blind Run is a damn good book. That's the first Charlie Muffin book I read in at least 20 years. I still remember the last one
@DJSlash9 oops! @Thizuu
@DJSlash9 don't tell me it has been an epic troll! @Thizuu
@DJSlash9 and you greeted me with their greeting :) @Thizuu
@DJSlash9 make no mistake, I am firmly against your candidate but that does not mean I am against you :-) @Thizuu
@DJSlash9 Online battles tend to degenerate pretty quickly because people can't see their 'enemy' @Thizuu
@SidathSam oops! Sometimes parents know best ;-)
@Dinouk_C @ahamednishadh can't someone give him a little push?
@PortelloFanatic @sameera79 you guys should try John le Carre (if you haven't already). Specifically the Quest for Karla
@PortelloFanatic that's even harder to digest than the book!
@sameera79 yes, slow going indeed. Took me quite a lot of time to finish Silmarillion too @PortelloFanatic
@PortelloFanatic no way a 4 min video can do justice. Even the movies of LOTR as you would have noticed don't
@PortelloFanatic I read cover to cover twice :-)
@PortelloFanatic (I know you've read the book)
@PortelloFanatic LOTR appendices are mandatory reading for Sri Lankans but I don't think even the extended version of movie has it.
@Thizuu and I think sisira has undone that RT cause I don't see now in my timeline (I am not following you)
@Thizuu I am sorry if there has been a misunderstanding. I replied to a war/electio related tweet of your which Sisira retweeted.
@Thizuu You mean like "he won the war give him a third term, then a fourth"? @DJSlash9
@akhilasg now try cashing a large cheque without ID
@DJSlash9 I am sorry I don't understand your reply. Can you clarify. thanks @Thizuu
@Thizuu @DJSlash9 excuse me you forget that people were gratefull and voted for him in 2010 for winning the war.
@gauravcsawant @PriyaRaju not talking of Sri lanka election are you?
@PlainTeaGirl not approving that audit stuff but the reality is unlike FB it takes a long long time to build up a big following.
@muditha @PlainTeaGirl let's build another road through Sinharaja
@elmoQ I am sorry it didn't work out.
@elmoQ I couldn't go and my daughter couldn't go either. I heard that he managed to set the record but don't have the details yet
The UNP seems to be having a  majority in this parliament.

I hope they will take just one million out of the hundreds of millions spent on night races and give it to the scrabble league.
Apparently 8 pedestrians crossed over and joined the last #PresPollSL rally in Kesbawa
@boredpumpkin no it's not at all far fetched. True audience pays, so they have to cater to their market @DilshanBoange
@boredpumpkin but it's privately held noh? They can do what they like noh? unlike the other two which is funded by us ? @DilshanBoange
@TheCitizen1 @muditha sadly many are living in a dream world most notably @UpulTR
@boredpumpkin Do you mean it's like ITN and Rupavahini? @DilshanBoange
@TheCitizen1 USA is still our number 1 business partner but we were just discussing the debt. @muditha @UpulTR
Yes @UpulTR , Sri Lanka owes a huge debt to China
Never knew that Jack Winchester was a pen name for Brian Freemantle.
Dezinformatsiya 
@kazZtr_ don't bother those things will only end up wrecking your engine in the long rung.
@kazZtr_ ECU busted? How on earth did you manage that?
@Sachira_R seems a much smaller crowd than at other venues.
Breaking the law. 
@kazZtr_ democracy :)
@kazZtr_ They are definitely not going to register those cars in their own names so IMHO the verdict is still out on this one.
@kazZtr_ yeah, I saw your tweet on that, hence the question.
Can't we just do `git reset --hard HEAD~1` on the constitution ?
@kazZtr_ yeah, cars being re-exported
@kazZtr_ BTW, what about those sports cars you think the photos are real?
@kazZtr_ It's luck of the draw. Some friends get their parts delivered to the doorstep, sometimes you have to go to Mcallum st. pay duty
@kazZtr_ you don't have difficulties with customs when getting them?
@moshanthi second time for me

hmm that must be about CTB 3000 bus loads in Badulla.
@muditha Since last friday I think. Was tied up with offline matters.
So apparently SF got hooted at a Jaffna meeting. Wonder why the other side isn't tweeting the hell out of that one
@NotJagath Fighting a lone battle :(
Not only has the government completely failed to protect the countries greenery. It has destroyed quite a bit of it on its own.
And I can hear the pounnding of an ax. You've probably seen me tweet this is very often. You can imagine how thick the vegetation used to be
@PortelloFanatic try to make it look election related @ShammasGhouse
@sameera79 if so I will agree with you it's a fake and Champaka screwed up (Ps. I have never been a fan of his)  @TheCitizen1
@sameera79 The same can be said about the photo. It may just be the one on the RHS that's shopped @TheCitizen1
@sameera79 ok, what about Athsanayake's secret deal?  @TheCitizen1
@sameera79 I an in full agreement with you and look forward to you speaking out against similar tactics on ITN, Rupavahini etc @TheCitizen1
@sameera79 even if the photo is fake does it change the fact? @TheCitizen1
@thameera "Off your dead ass and on your dying feet" @NotJagath
Victoria sluice gates; are they still open?
I am not a catholic but will vote for @pontifex if he ran for #PresPollSL  
 
@kazZtr_ AFIK the total number of M5s in SL would be less than 10
@kazZtr_ Finding a genuind M is pretty hard in SL @TheCitizen1
@Shailendree things change a lot over 35 years :-)
@TheCitizen1 no it's not a big deal, but just a enough to clog the filter in front of the pump (fuel pump was moved outside by milroy)
@TheCitizen1 slight rust in petrol tank and distributor cup needs replacing (these are new issues which weren't there before)
@ameenizzadeen @Azaardeen Ranil had a golden opportunity and a moral right nay, obligation to do that once but didn't
@TheCitizen1 He came finally when another friend told him, I am considering about taking it to mila
@TheCitizen1 He will be here in about a week (I hope) I will show him then. In the meantime, I reminded him of your matter. Pls ring and see
@TheCitizen1 BTW, karu came yesterday. Lot's of new niggles developed by the car being idle for a month. You better get yours fixed quick
@ZamanX90 Hedging.
@TheCitizen1 I was discussing this with Karu yesterday, He said hasn't seen a single manual f10 yet @kazZtr_
@kazZtr_ hardly ever see a manual bimmer nowdays in SL
@Sansajran so far three stat departments have made predictions (don't want to use the term forecast here) they don't seem scientific at all
@Sansajran true, true, silly of me to have missed it. Too bad the stat depts at our universities also seem to have missed it.
What awaits poachers and drug smugglers on the Palk Strait  when that international conspiracy is hatched. 
@bestazhar @mhmhisham a scorecard is the need of the hour.
"I have become comfortably numb" #sajje - argubly the best song in the Wall though Another brick in the wall Part II seems the best known.
@TheCitizen1 @Lasaa_V that's pretty much a public secret for the past few years
@TheCitizen1 still 9 short of the promised figure! 12 if we deduct Athsanayake, Katagoda and rumoured premadasa
"And I don't need no drugs to calm me.
I have seen the writing on the wall."

#sajje
"how should I complete the wall?" #sajje
"mother do you think they've got the bomb? .... mother should I run for president?" #sajje
@Sansajran as the saying gone, don't count chickens until the eggs are hatched
@SampathBankPLC thanks. and Happy new year!
@erangatennakoon That peace process was fiasco, but when negotiating obviously she can't say I am talking to that bastard prabhakaran :)
@erangatennakoon not so in 1994 she got a landslide win and everyone wanted her to negotiate with terrorists. I think this is from that time
@erangatennakoon an out of context quote I think. She did lose an eye to 'Mr Prabhakaran' ps: I thoroughly hate CBK
@Miyuruhansi I also remember a time when he was a respected writer.
@Miyuruhansi thanks and wish you the same.
@Musathik thanks and wish you the same
@Musathik "මා  එක්ක අමනාපයකින්වත්ද දන්නේ නෑනේ .."
@kazZtr_ thanks and wish you the same
@Musathik time to delete a few tweets?
@kazZtr_ would have been easier to write a small script
@eclayaz @Sansajran @moogater @Bunis_Malli @NimalkaZ @Parinda_R @wanamalikumari @Anjalaf @udajith @its_me_dul thanks wish the same
@muditha @TheCitizen1 @maranaya @madhuh @kadawara @NalakaG @groundviews thanks and wish you the same
@KaluMallii Ranjan Khan!
@KaluMallii Wassat DP, you got caught up in a fishing net or something?
@Rathgamaya in my day UoC Chem was Good. Not outstanding but we still had a few brilliant lecturers. ANd we and Prof JNO visiting @muditha
@RubenThurairaj Daily Mirror has publishes two surveys(?) one by UoK and other by UoC on the election.
@muditha from what's on daily mirror neither of those studies sound even remotely likely a scientific survey sounds like pure guesswork.
@muditha and I know from experience how lousy statistics at UoC is. my understanding is that all science subjects at UoK &lt; UoC
If you are planning to enter the University of Kelaniya or Colombo don't choose statistics as a subject.
@lahirunirmala aiyo!
@lahirunirmala mouse deer and porcupines still there?
@kau_mad actually quite a nice chap but brainwashed by the propaganda :(
Amusing how @upultr is treating the rubbish on gossip sites like the gospel while completely ignoring verified facts and figures.
රොබර්ට් බ්‍රවුන්රිග්…
@Rathgamaya I don't think that's true, he had no reason to be on that route did he? I think it's a spin on his 2002 hit and run conviction
@Rangi_Bungi30 you don't really expect a Sri Lankan news paper to name names do you? @maranaya
@chanux I can only assume that @UpulTR doesn't like the truth :)
@PlainTeaGirl if religious people get involved in politics they are fair game (disclaimer: I do not belong to any religious group)
@PlainTeaGirl tweets saying there is a secret agreement between MS and LTTE without proof?
@muditha @NisansaDdS I still think @UpulTR is a decent bloke (though he supports the wrong candidate) :-)
Aiyo I am blocked by @upulTR , I suppose that's the twitter equivalent of kill the messenger.
TNA, SLMC and ACBC did not bring any votes with them, yet antoginized a lot of hardline sinhala buddhists.
@Shailendree your balance must be pretty good. I am too scared to even login to internet banking.
@RajivaW why not stop preaching to the choir and try to convert the likes to 3-wheeler drivers. They are almost all against your candidate
@TheCitizen1 sigh! like churchill (approval rating 83% in 1944) famously said, the man to win the war isn't the man to win the peace @UpulTR
@UpulTR but hang in there when he finally passes the right to information act you will be able to see his and mr's assets at least
@UpulTR oh yeah! he is a bastard. But still better than the mind numbing levels of corruption we have in the current regime.
@DeaneJ @udaraau @Apelankawe but sadly one of the biggest problems with bootstrap 3 is that it's all the same. But then no big deal for me2
@UpulTR see we clearly need a right to information act to be passed (which apparently is in MY3 manifesto)
@DeaneJ @udaraau @Apelankawe they are both using Bootstrap ( 
@SampathBankPLC can I know your IBAN number. It's not listed on your website
@naveenmadhawa woah there are more brothers?
It would have been better for  @MaithripalaS to have asked Virat Kohli to support him instead of the TNA.
@TheCitizen1 @muditha 
@TheCitizen1 @muditha something new come up? is the TNA going to support my3? damn!
@chanux you don't want to be able to travel to practically any country in the world without visa trouble?
@naveenmadhawa +dulles +sajin
When #MY3 makes Sri Lanka a US state, the US Navy is going to kick the asses of those indian fishermen and drug smugglers!
OMG it's a Grand American conspiracy says govt: 
@himalkk @thameera Diyawanna.
@UpulTR political opinions aside, I think the rest of our opinions are similar. Hope we can remain friends after the 9th (war till then)
@himalkk why did you do it? well at least you can use the VIP channel at the airport from now on. @thameera
@UpulTR try sprining someone out of prison. you will then be able to use the VIP channel.
@UpulTR how about valuing people who never took up terrorism instead of valuing child killers?
@UpulTR What about the thousands he killed?
@erangatennakoon @kazZtr_ My anger is primarily at the massive destruction of nature in this country in the last few years.
@UpulTR Sorry if such a plainly obvious answer does not seem clear to you. On the MY3 side victims of LTTE bombings. On MR side LTTE bombers
@UpulTR I am not a my3 suppoter but SF, CBK, and Sirisena all targetted by the LTTE in the past are better bets than KP, Karuna, Pilliyan
Anyone have a scorecard of the crossovers? Not just parliamentarians but provincial councillors and local government councillors?
@ShammasGhouse @PortelloFanatic tell me this stuff is made up
The destruction of the Battaramulla bird habitat was begun by JR, accelerated by CBK and completed by MR.
@alokag @nazly @udithaumesh and less cops
@NotRomesh All the broken buses that used to lie at Thalangama depot for years and years fixed! for flood relief work of course.
@nazly @udithaumesh last time in Kandy road it was twice in 2km! Bring back the police commision and bribary commission!!
@elmoQ DM
@hirosht scores please! ps: check DM
@cernoblog road.lk also get's a honourable mention :)
@cernoblog very fitting isn't it? I initially thought it was the other khan apparently at a meeting he had been introduced as such!!
@udithaumesh makes me dizzy ( I can't play first person shooters either :(  )
@muditha oh sorry  did I miss something?
Salman Khan faces 10 years in jail for a hit and run case. 
@UpulTR Like I said, I really haven't read either manifesto and can't be bothered to in the past a manifesto meant little in SL elections.
@UpulTR TL DR; and not very interesting either. But one thing for sure, guy who forced the 18th isn't going to be the one to repeal it.
@PortelloFanatic at the same time I really hope those of us on twitter aren't deluding ourselves. The offline world is very different
@UpulTR if they just repeal the 18th and implement the 17th, I will be satisified with that.
@PortelloFanatic the exact opposite, joined the melee. Now that the tide seems to have turned, it's bit of fun
@PortelloFanatic The day the election was announced I urged the local twittersphere to finalize the hashtag so that I could mute it!
@PortelloFanatic @HaaziqUvais and how about also the Children of Hurin (though a very depressing tale.)
@NandikaBeddegam me and @muditha didn't say anything about defeating MR. Just pointed out the family in your pic were evicted @PlainTeaGirl
Beat up local singers and actors and parade Salaman Khan on the same day. Ironic much?
@PlainTeaGirl one of the reasons they were shown the door.
@ShammasGhouse apparently he had asked all the top brass to travel together that fatefull day and thereby put all the eggs in one basket.
@ShammasGhouse a late butt in on one of your flame wars; actually premadasa is indirectly responsible for Kobbakaduwa's death.
@xelene Hello there! Long time no talk! Back in the states now right?
George Washington. 
@PlainTeaGirl so where does India stand in the scale from China to USA?
@PlainTeaGirl isn't that a foreign conspiracy for subramanian to meddle in Sri Lankan affairs?
@muditha he left, I was debating whether to give him some money or not, decided not to cause it might effect his self respect.
Poor 'bombai motai' man says because of the rain he hasn't been able to make enough money even to  buy food.
@chanux one of the biggest mysteries of the 21st centuries is why people tune into to that station :-)
if you say all politicians are corrupt so it has to be tolerated; you are probably someone who benefits directly or indirectly from it. #lka
Please do follow @Channa_Amare
@Channa_Amare oh sorry for not following back till now. On this account, I usually don't check the followers list
"There's none so blind as those who will not see"
@gsenev but you didn't answer my question
@gsenev and these are?
I really don't mind the excesses from 3 years, 3 months or even 3 days ago. It's the excesses from 30 years ago that gets me worked up!!
On SLT @ccolombotelegrap resolves correctly it's only on dialog that it resolves to 127.0.0.1
Sorry that was on dialog. Nameserver 

@lahirunirmala even in the books there are plenty of inconsistencies, he wrote them kind of like the way software is written
@lahirunirmala yeah, really need to read the Silmarillion and and LOTR (including the appendices). The movies are poor adaptations.
@lahirunirmala and I am at the limit of my knowledge on the subject :-)
@lahirunirmala unlikely cause they would have been burnt by it when they touched it and word would quickly have spread.
@lahirunirmala if I remember correctly dwarves cannot touch the Silmarils
@lahirunirmala All the Silmarils were lost (ref The Silmarillion ). The Arkenstone is of Dwarwish make.
@UKaveenR Actually I am not surprised. Remember this si not sentiment analysis.
Benito Mussolini was actually elected to power 
@UKaveenR also @groundviews has an archive of old stuff if you want to go back in time.
Well what do you know @siripalabot is on github 
@UKaveenR thanks. Will see if I can integrate that tokenizer (time permitting)
@UKaveenR link please
@UKaveenR oh and good stuff!!
@UKaveenR Also how about a tokenizer that strips out common words like the, an, and etc. As I recall redisbayes 's tokenizer easy to extract
@UKaveenR me thinks presrajapakse should also be one of the keywords chosen for close analysis. But results will be skewed by his 15 bots
@UpulTR Oh I am so sorry! You first posted your concern about a wanted man being allowed to pass through VIP channel. I was just saying why.
@UpulTR but this is not my opinion. This is the fact passed by parliament. 18th amendment removed all independence of courts and police.
@UpulTR Ah the guy who is supposed to be independent but now appointed at the sole discretion of the execute since 18th amendment?
@UpulTR the minister will answer your question in person on his return
@muditha Oh! according to earlier tweets i thought they had flown together. Maybe they will still meetin Singapore and hatch a conspiracy.
@muditha you think they have fled?
@zrimax  I think South Ceylon had it  @Miyuruhansi @TheSauceCode
@zrimax In galle, I believe it's called Burudal @Miyuruhansi @TheSauceCode
@zrimax @Miyuruhansi @TheSauceCode That is what local bakers call breudher
@muditha :-) not the high ups but maybe someone in the lowest echelons knows and he is being totally ignored.
Maybe one of these CTB bus drivers will be able to come up with a new algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem.
Do those CTB buses travel from meeting to meeting or is it a different set of buses (and crowds) for each meeting?
The Honolulu Advertiser on the frantic activities at the Pacific Tsunami warning center. Published on 29, Dec 2004 
Then (Pacific tsunami warning center) called everyone they could thing of in Sri Lanka. Didn't get a  response 
Let us also remember that when the Pacific Tsunami early warning center called the SL Met dept this day ten years ago no one answered.
@TheCitizen1 I also could see it from my rooftop, but some idiot built a big building exactly along that line of sight :(
Met dept says it's a depression. That's probably why I can see clear skies far off and can even see the central hills from Battaramulla
@muditha he'll run with this tail between his legs and come up with an argument as to why he shouldn't defect.  But that's political suicide
Before the #my3 campaign speaks one word about the tsunami, they have to show the door to the former CJ.
@CrazyPusa yes I remember that well. Except for DBW, it has always been by hook or by .... @plainteagirl
Funny isn't it that our former CJ comes out from under the rock he was hiding under around the time of the tsunami anniversary.
@Shailendree hope they have got their critical path analysis right.
@himalkk @Dili I am not an expert @jackpoint627  seems to have given a very good answer.
@muditha they seem to be hitting Faizer Mustapha
@nazly Oh! I only know of Ross and Jerome Taylor!
Oh and BTW, Victoria dam was a gift to Sri Lanka from Britain. Yes, those days European countries were very friendly towards us.
@chanux maybe SB and Dayasiri are deep penetration agents of Mangala like he had in RW's short lived Govt
@chanux that would explain it. Dayasiri's comment was about voters and education levels ;-)
@chanux overwhelming majority of Tuk drivers are for the incumbent. Remember what Dayasiri said? ;-)
Next year for the first time since James Taylor planted the first tea bush in Ceylon, Wages maybe determined by market forces.
@Shailendree wasn't that a Five year plan? I think Gorby had several 500 day plans
@CrazyPusa so you are saying now even southern province might be lost? @plainteagirl
Our dog isn't bothered by crackers. Because she's almost deaf.
@muditha @TheCitizen1 @Ayshmarq very interesting.
@PlainTeaGirl @CrazyPusa I think incumbent will win the southern province + Monaragala. Hopeless in other places.
@PlainTeaGirl too bad.
@PlainTeaGirl What I meant was that I thought, he didn't need to bus people for southern province meetings @CrazyPusa
@kazZtr_ that's almost every christmas since 1987
@CrazyPusa thought he was pretty strong in Galle
JHU splintered. ACMC split. SLMC Divided and now CWC split! Now if TNA and NFF follows suite it would be a perfect christmas.
@chammarox and it's not eating up public funds.
@elmoQ for a while I was but in SL it's highly impractical so eat meat occaisionally
@kau_mad @ShammasGhouse didn't see the video but I heard something like that
@ShammasGhouse @kau_mad of course one can argue that the students turned against them not yesterday but at the Mahapola fiasco.
@ShammasGhouse @kau_mad yesterday's masterpiece at Ward place turned the whole student population against them, and today at Siri Kotha
@kau_mad @thameera @udendra I hope the same standards are there, but loss of Dr Premadasa, Ramasinghe and Mr Abeysinghe would count heavily
@kau_mad @thameera @udendra I have no respect for UoC stat but when we were there, the Math dept was something else!
@JayamalDeVas @JustRuky :-) I never had any sympathy for student unions before, while and after being and undergrad. Till now that is
@JustRuky welcome to the club.
@thameera @kau_mad @NisansaDdS for real math you have to goto UoC instead of UoM :-)
@thameera ADSL SLT
@thameera works for me
My lawn is a swamp. Lucky for me that I love wetlands.
@muditha while I didn't agree with you Saturday. Now I am in 100% agreement. They know the result @TheCitizen1 @officialunp
@TheCitizen1 @officialunp @muditha but I am beginning to see slow changes. A month ago, cops wouldn't have intervened at all.
@UKaveenR @erangatennakoon glad to know my guess was right. It certainly is a lovely lang. (let's hope we dont spark a religious debate)
@UKaveenR @erangatennakoon let me guess python?
@iFeelYouJohanna @SueKiri If they had left individually they would have been broken quite easily (Ps I don't think much of some defectors )
@DulithK trying to get two pounds of flesh from both candidates.
@Fulton89 not bad, but my staple diet is heavy metal.
@Fulton89 started exploring animals. I am a bit of a psychedelic rock fan but haven't heard any of their stuff
@Fulton89 and all this time I thought it was Deep Purple who sang it first
@MoAwesomeSauce do they sell Rambutan and Durian too? @himalkk
@PlainTeaGirl @CrazyPusa @ZamanX90 seriously 0_0 ?  (I don't know if emoticon has been invented to for that one yet! )
@himalkk @MoAwesomeSauce but the destruction! In other countries this is planned harvesting. OTH cyprus isn't a Native tree so guess it's ok
@PlainTeaGirl @CrazyPusa @ZamanX90 I blame it on our stupid education system. Even at university levels you are not encouraged to challenge
@himalkk and possibly a few bribes somewhere because trees cannot be transported without a license
@PlainTeaGirl @CrazyPusa @ZamanX90 isn't it amazing how people fall for this kind of document which can be so easily faked
@NeedyReaders well not all, I still have Finar and J.D Lee but against my better judgement I leant my Atkins and didn't get it back :(
@NeedyReaders Well i did give away all my university text books. That was worth a small fortune
I appreciate @NeedyReaders efforts but how can anyone bear to part with a book? 0_0
@ruwindada and then beat the hell out of them?
@sameera79 You don't know of all the rules that were added over the last 10 years making it practically impossible for them to operate?
