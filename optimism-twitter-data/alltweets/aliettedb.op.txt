@literfan @BrandSanderson @jeffvandermeer @PatrickRothfuss @LairdBarron muchas gracias! And congrats everyone!
And with that, we're going to the market, and then to family lunch. Have fun everyone!
1000 words of loaded conversation around a buffet at this culture's equivalent of a one-month ceremony. Space soap opera FTW
@boygainvillea that sounds about right
@boygainvillea hahaha I have lots of expertise in this currently ^^ mostly running on four legs in a very odd way
Your morning House of Shattered Wings pin 
This story is really soap opera in space. Space soap opera. With plenty of soap.
@krfsm writing certainly isn't hurt by them!
@ruthmidget I can live with that :)
And now doing a difficult balancing act on complexity of world vs events actually happening. Challenging universe I picked
@likhain he, thanks! Always fun to go with snakelet, he watches everything
@GillianPolack yep
This morning: successfully beat back the little voices of doubt into submission. Thank God for flamethrowers :) #amwriting
@likhain he. They do turn out very snuggly in winter :) :)
@likhain yum. We're making something with leeks, and then going to the market.
@likhain awwww
@GillianPolack he. I'm glad you're not alone--enough push and there's hope of change
(that last via @GillianPolack)
We don't have to be major characters, but the novel has to be set in a world in which we have the potential to exist. 
@AstridBear thank you! We will see how it goes
@LindaNagata I am! It is an expedition :)
@bethwodzinski @seanmarkey :) I'm cooking myself consolatory noodles
@BeezyAl pretty darn cute, yep
@theinferior ha. How old was he?
@KeithAManuel English and French :)
@D_Libris @ce_murphy it is pretty freaky. In a good way :)
@mikaela_l :)
@titetraductrice 20 months old
He's been going back and forth between us, showing us a book open at the same page and waiting for us to speak
Hmm. Fascinating. I think the snakelet has just realized the H and I don't speak the same language to him
@bethwodzinski @seanmarkey ooooooh waffles
@LindaNagata oooooh, hope we run into each other!
@ce_murphy :( hugs
@fidelioscabinet hahaha yes. But all I have is blank paper
@nothingsmonstrd oh yeah, I've seen those. They're awesome, but I can't draw them :)
Demonstrating the principles of tessellation to the snakelet. Yeah, all I can draw properly is an interlocking pattern of hexagons :)
New ghostwords post! "We wept on the banks of the river of healing and prayed for the coming of night." 
@mikaela_l ooooh
@jolantru @rcloenenruiz HUGS back
Oooooh Osgood returns to Doctor Who 
I suppose it's wrong of me, but I might be more excited about Mr Holmes than Star Wars VII. Well, ok. Equally excited
@riajuunibyou yeah, I just don't understand how people get away with failing biology 101 (esp. lawmakers)
Ian McKellen in Mr Holmes: international trailer 
@garethlpowell if I'm allowed 4 authors rather than 4 books, you can throw in @KateElliottSFF's awesome short story collection
@garethlpowell @matociquala's Shattered Pillars and Steles of the Sky, Terry Pratchett's Small Gods, and @JustinaRobson's Glorious Angels
[TW] Misconsceptions about miscarriages 
@likhain ha. Also works for short stories, btw :) Sending all the inspiration
@likhain oooooooooooooh
@lioneldavoust great minds :)
@fran_wilde w00t!!!
Official status of writer: still underwater, I'm afraid. If I owe you email or anything else, it's coming, I swear!
@ShvetaThakrar thank you!
Story edits done. One chapter of proofs read. Now going to bed, I reckon.
@AnimaExTenebris thank you--glad you enjoyed it!
"Anything that holds onto power that long ossifies." #wip #xuya
"Emperors and empresses need to live and die; and so do courts and officials. The base unit of our lives is still human; still mortal.. #wip
@irinarempt oooh. He would love that to bits. Thanks
@irinarempt hahaha thanks. (I'm not sure I thanked you for the book recs the other day btw? Very useful since we're getting to that age)
@thelionmachine :( :( so sorry. Please take care of yourself
@KateElliottSFF :) thank you!
@ms_emmalyon @KateElliottSFF er... I guess?
@cindypon @kyliu99 ha. That'd be me and cooking then.
@kyliu99 @cindypon which reminds me I should put it online at some point, when I get enough energy
@kyliu99 @cindypon hahaha, I used a 1900 map of Paris and drew the outline by transparency
@marthawells1 ^^
@kyliu99 @cindypon we can commiserate together Ken :) (there's a reason I picked up writing :) )
@marthawells1 he, thanks! I drew a bunch of inspiration from your Death of the Necromancer--loved the period Paris feel of that one
"... loyalty, and leadership. Its portrait of a ruined Paris ruled by fallen angels is one I won't soon forget.” @KateElliottSFF
“An intense, beautiful, brutal journey written with an eye for the stunning, vivid detail and the cruel demands of duty ..." @KateElliottSFF
Also, did I mention House of Shattered Wings got an awesome @KateElliottSFF quote?
Also sending hugs and cake to @KariSperring (and a lot of other UK friends) in the wake of the General Election :( :(
@marthawells1 I'm sure it's a fabulous book! (you're a great writer and you don't write shoddy books, to say the least!)
Snakelet is going around calling for "Mama" #awww
@cindypon ^^
@malindalo I don't know if it's changed lately? It feels like an increase too to me
Cindy's paintings are awesome 
@cindypon that is so cute!
Plans for today: hopefully edit story, trying out a zucchini clementine recipe courtesy of @Banhmi11uk, and then mindless TV time
Today is a holiday. Mostly it's been laundry, some novel related stuff, and a lot of snakelet related stuff. Ah, the glamorous writers' life

Recommendation: Don't get sick in the UK.
@mikaela_l @ce_murphy hugs and lots of strength

My sympathies to UK people :( :(
@KariSperring @charlesatan hi Charles, hi Kari (and big big hugs)
Congrats @laurenbeukes on the Shirley Jackson awards nomination
@likhain sounds like a plan ^^
@charlesatan wow. Thanks. That's awesome
So I just went and pinned more stuff to the Pinterest board :) 
Chapter four of the proofs. I think I'm officially sick of reading this book

@PrinceJvstin large place... ^^
@PrinceJvstin I saw, the one set in the Lotus Kingdoms? Don't know if that's the equivalent of SE Asia?
@PrinceJvstin ha. Seems to have worked for her, though.
@PrinceJvstin ha. I didn't think she would. She'd been unflinching up till that point
@KariSperring @IlanaCT urk. The press has been a disaster
@hawkwing_lb ah. I read book 1 when it was released, so I didn't twig on to that
@PrinceJvstin the landing was awesome. Not unexpected, but still. Gut punch
(the fact I read it in one day should be a clue ^^)
Finished @matociquala's Steles of the Sky. Amazing book. I was more than a little weepy by the end
@KariSperring @IlanaCT :( :( so sorry to hear this
.@GillianPolack on using Yiddish with her 
@adribbleofink urk. That is wrong on so many levels
@adribbleofink also :( :(
@adribbleofink really? Everyone keeps asking us the gender of ours (before using pronouns)
Anatomy of a Regency letter. This is awesome 
@eilatan yeah :(
@kellybarnhill I just. Maybe stop to consider someone who lived through the actual events might have a better judgment than you
@eilatan he did get chewed quite comprehensively, but I'm not sure he understood how hurtful that throwaway remark was
@msagara well, that too. The whole thing was surreal. In a bad way
@bethwodzinski it was. Wow.
(also, I could have done without the subsequent lengthy discussion on a triggery subject)
@mikaela_l I just. I just stood there and. Wow.
Pro tip: don't lecture a South Vietnamese from my parents' generation on the ending of the Vietnam War being a good thing. Just don't
... then went on to say "yes, but those monks were instrumental in ending the Vietnam War" I tried very hard to keep a straight face
Prize for "most careless remark" goes to: student in qi gong class, upon being lectured by master that monks shouldn't engage in politics...
@stephanieburgis oooooh sleep yay! Sympathize (got post office a few weeks ago only because there was something I needed to mail urgently)
Yes. Sometimes I do love France (well, that, and the smell of freshly baked bread in the morning :) )
I just got 60 euros to spend on books or DVDs (my company gives us "cultural vouchers" in order to help people access cultural products)

@Cadigan glad to hear it, sending best wishes
@malindalo :)
@malindalo oh good! I know my sister was desolate when she moved to another country and found there were no Asian supermarkets
@malindalo sympathies. One advantage of living in Paris=big diasporic Vietnamese community + good restaurants + good supplliers
Happy birthday Gene Wolfe!
@Cadigan *hugs* glad you had a good time at the Clarke and hope chemo-dip-in-mood continues to pass
Any time. Though one doesn't need to vote for Lord Vetinari as he has the Vote 
@mikaela_l it feels Roman to me, not at all medieval
@AidanRWalsh it's amazing isn't it. Suddenly your entire life up to now feels very inefficient 0_0
@krfsm ha, it was. The entire "people showing up at the ball" was awesome
Learning one's own skill set, part the N: I am not a very good proof reader (I read fast and extrapolate if there's anything missing/wrong)
@bethwodzinski :(
(OK, I know life got a little bit more harried after motherhood. But still)
Basically becoming a mom: wondering how come you managed so little with all the spare time you had before kids
@SheckyX :D :D
I am thankful for the existence of the Ascension weekend, which basically means not working from Wednesday to Sunday next week
Next weekend we have House of Shattered Wings proofs due, and other short story to brainstorm and write. #busymom
Things to do things to do: introduction for essay collection to write. Short story to write. Short story to rewrite. That's this weekend
So I had 400 words on this story. I think they're the wrong ones. And the wrong story. Ah well. #writerslife
@marcusgipps @greg_jenner @orionbooks we mostly pull that as jokes on other colleagues
@jimmynohands ha. But I feel Carrot fleshed out much better in Men at Arms? The "city as his patch" was better done
@jimmynohands ha, not entirely immune though? Vimes is the prime example of that, also Susan Sto Helit (*much* better in Hogfather)
Can I also point out the Annotated Pratchett Files? 
@jimmynohands Mightily Oats was right from the get-go, too
@charlesatan also wow that gives me an average of 4 days per Discworld book (plus all the other ones I read)
@charlesatan gosh is it? I thought it was longer than that!
@jimmynohands oh yeah, definitely. Also applies to Casanuda actually
Also, I found @tansyrr's essays on Women in Pratchett and they're fantastic 
@tansyrr ha, I was thinking L&amp;L! It is a very female centred book but less so than WA
And Casanuda ^^ #discworldreread
And Greebo in human shape. The awesome (though again I think Maskerade makes better use of him) #discworldreread
But it's definitely got cool things. The ball/cocktail party is hilarious, the showdown Lily/Granny rocks #discworldreread
And I confess nowadays I'm finding it hard to read the book without thinking of the Princess and the Frog ^^ #discworldreread
@tansyrr oh yeah. And very female centred too, in different situations (and Magrat and the helmet is awesome)
@TheWorrierPoet :( (though seen from abroad we're more used to coalitions)
But not necessarily a very focused one and not necessarily bringing much to the novel beyond (pure gold) comedy #discworldreread
To my mind, Witches Abroard suffers a bit from travelogue structure, lots of very sharp jokes (Dracula, bull running)  #discworldreread
(there's kind of same ending in Carpe Jugulum with Granny, and I think the one in CJ is stronger? B/c societally sharper) #discworldreread
@tansyrr *nod* the best of the Witches series, to my mind. Probably in my top 5
But it does deepen the relationships between the witches quite nicely, and the ending with the mirrors is also pretty pretty strong
On Nth reread I don't think it's the best of the Witches series (hard to beat Lords and Ladies/Carpe Jugulum!) #discworldreread
Right. So #discworldreread: Witches Abroad. It's an interesting book. Loved it when I first read it, because of fairy tales subversions
@likhain @KateElliottSFF @alessahinlo @word_carpentry ^^ that's pretty!
More about my books:

This is worth saying a million times, esp if u can't find it. 
@marc_tassin *peering through gummed eyes* I know the feeling, approaching it from the other end of the night
Sabaa Tahir's "Ember in the Ashes" 
@jophan_c he
@likhain @KateElliottSFF @alessahinlo @word_carpentry @ShvetaThakrar go go go!
@finavir aw thank you!
@bogo_lode @matociquala it is
New ghostwords post! "The spirits whisper about me while I rummage through the trash" 
@matociquala LOL. Yeah, the ending is... very effective (also, who wouldn't want an army of the undead as a wedding present? :D)
@hawkwing_lb ha. No spoilers please!
#StrangeAndNorrell. 17.05.15.

@hawkwing_lb ha *puts on party clothes* I am going to go read the final book
Though awww Temur and Samarkar are so cute
Guess the burden of trying to care for a city through sheer exhaustion feels more familiar and more immediate now than fighting asassins
Was surprised to be hit harder by the narrative strand of Tsering-la and Hong-la, rather than Temur/Samarkar.
@hawkwing_lb it is rather glorious. I feel like I'm coming late to the party!
Fortunately I have Steles of the Sky on my ereader :D :D
Whelp. Just finished @matociquala's Shattered Pillars. Wow.
@dsimons_123 lol. Actual experience is always helpful :)
@sineadredmond @jimmynohands aw thank you, hope you enjoy :)
@dsimons_123 I am tempted...
@KeithAManuel lol. I think mine ran away because we only have powdered milk in this house ^^
@dsimons_123 :( :( oh yes, so much discovering happening. And the power of gravity when losing your balance
@BenGalley I'm writing a story. Doing a little more for me :)
W000t congrats @EmilyMandel for the @ClarkeAward win
My brownies tend to take anything from a couple of weeks to a couple of years :)  
@mahveshm let's!
I'm not at the #clarkeawards, but following with interest
So. This is a story about reanimation, VR. And zombies.
@cindypon ooooooh congrats!!!
@RachelAnneMarks :D :D
@LeeAHarris :( :( process taking up all the memory? Can you access terminal?
@LeeAHarris urk, what happened? Just turned itself off?
@aptshadow :)
@AnimaExTenebris aw thank you, glad you're enjoying it
@mikaela_l ^^
LOL. That's me too! *fist bump* 
@LeeAHarris urk. Sympathies. Mine's at the repair shop, fortunately I got everything backed up
Having a relaxing evening while cooking xa xiu (barbecued pork)
@ghostwritingcow yay!!!
@mikaela_l really?
@booksmugglers tease :)
@Cadigan @ChuckWendig I was told vitamin b12 I think? The one in animals livers
@ShvetaThakrar @ac_wise ooooh have fun!
That is awesome 
@ms_emmalyon am really looking forward to it!
Wow 
Because lack of spoons 
@AthenaHelivoy hahaha yes. Every time I see one such article I resist the urge to poke holes in it
@KatWithSword so pretty!
@likhain er. Have they talked to actual creative people?
OMG baby dragon (just read the first book but it was fabulous) 
@stephanieburgis sympathies :(
@MaryRobinette oh dear
The Dark Side of the Road. Book Review | The British Fantasy Society 
@AthenaHelivoy I just never understand how people can claim to prove that kind of thing
@KatWithSword aw thank you!
3:30 and no spoons. This is going to be a long day
@laurenbeukes I made the mistake of googling "snake bites on human body". It put me off going out for some time
@fran_wilde @BCSmagazine *happy dance*
@Blackmudpuppy LOL. I'd encourage the snakelet to scream loudly, but it appears the walls are insulated against that
I'm now fighting the temptation to go yell at the guy (if only I knew who it was. It's a big building)
*sigh* nap time rudely interrupting by someone drilling holes in a wall. Turns out the snakelet isn't a fan of drills
Advice for authors looking for an agent 
@mikaela_l @KariSperring I think we already sent ours her way? Here it's windy and pouring rain
@KariSperring @charlesatan hi Kari and Charles
@stephanieburgis thanks! Feeling very relieved
@SolarisBooks have fun!
@neilwilliamson clearly. And I never even got to drink it. The world is unfair :(
@SCyFlynn :)
@neilwilliamson it was green. Finest sencha. For some reason I didn't get noises of appreciation
Update: the macbook air (the casualty of the 400mL tea spill) is now fixed. Going to pick it up this week. W00t
@neilwilliamson yeah, mine lasted 0 minutes unplugged (I fried the battery with 400mL of tea). Hoping for more :)
@neilwilliamson w00t! Going to get mine back with new battery this week.
@irinarempt ha. We are reading those. Well, more like staring at the pictures, but @Banhmi11uk's Vietnamese market cookbook is a big hit
@SCyFlynn in the heart of a star. The best kind!
@PrinceJvstin I try my best :)
@psursi I think he's proved quite comprehensively that he mastered that one...
@likhain I was thinking computer engineering, personally, but I'm biased (the physics's books are the H's)
@likhain :) no worries!
Alexandra Pierce on April in Australian SFF 
The snakelet just handed me two physics book and the "how to bake bread" book so I could read them to him. Get them young, is all I'll say
@charlesatan go is a programming nightmare from what I've understood
ICYMI, this awesome interview with @KariSperring @jolantru @wordfey 
@charlesatan it is. No idea how good a chess player the H is, though. Very different mindset from what I understood
@likhain W00t!!!
Oh yeah. The chess part, too (that's why I have the H, a dedicated go player :) ) 

Essays, reviews, ruminations on sff from all over.
(I wrote th…
@jade_kadir French (well, for working I mostly functioni in French, and then all my colleagues duck when I start speaking English)
@visyap @charlesatan @zenaldehyde good morning/afternoon :)
@bentylersmith it's a pretty huge step for me too
@MangoHeroics :) fair point!
@jade_kadir @KameronHurley @MaryRobinette I switch to English when I'm furious. With an accent verging on the British, apparently
@likhain :) :)
@likhain thank you!
@likhain awesome! Do let me know (not that it changes anything: unless snakelet refuses to nap I'll be writing)
@likhain *hugs* sending virtual chocolate
@likhain awwww such a cutie pie! About to go to bed here :)
@Keffy @rachelswirsky's Grand Jeté from Subterranean? It's wonderful character work around grief and artificial intelligence
@GillianPolack I tried switching afterwards, and it was painful
@GillianPolack ha. Funny how different people have different processes. For me a character isn't only a name, but they need a name
@ShvetaThakrar ooooh congrats!
@susan_lanigan no :(
@MaryRobinette ha yes (I know the feeling. We just got back from a holiday and the washing machine is bulging)
Being "reasonable" and being angry 
@ms_marques yeah. It's pretty amazing.
Right. I got 150 words. But mostly everything has got name. I'll call that progress #amwriting
@GillianPolack ha. Funny. I just can't work like that. If I don't have the names I feel like I'm missing something
Right. Step 1 of writing: give characters names. Step 2 of writing: give technology names
@matociquala hahaha 2-year-olds are the best. I hope Protag #4 has lots of calories and unending patience
@KDandenell would be glad to :) (world con?)
@shaunduke @AceRocBooks @Gollancz @SkiffyandFanty gladly :)
@didic @maxgladstone he, that's true. Hadn't even noticed :)
@silvanhistorian @RomeoRites @AceRocBooks @Gollancz aw thank you! It's thanks to @NekroXIII @Adam_Auerbach
@SuziSteffen :) thank you so much. Hope you enjoy
@RomeoRites @AceRocBooks @Gollancz thank you!
@mythicdelirium thank you! It's thanks to @NekroXIII and @Adam_Auerbach
And now I'll stop the self promo tweets and go write, promise.
The House of Shattered Wings coming August 18th (fr/ @AceRocBooks)/August 20th (fr/ @Gollancz) 
@Matt_Baxter_ I was more thinking shoddy bio-engineering :)
@CrescentTea hahaha, zombies can be dangerous!
"...beneath the burden of its imperial sins, burns with vengeful magic and subtle, shining prose." 2/2 @maxgladstone I have awesome quotes
Also, thx @maxgladstone for for this: "Fantastic! de Bodard's tale of a post-everything Paris, struggling toward an uncertain future..." 1/2
Right. I think I'm getting a handle on what the zombie is doing on the space station. #amplotting
@KDandenell @matociquala I am enjoying :)
@NessieSnake thank you!
@aptshadow electrocute them with the ebook reader?

Jeff Vandermeer sez: "The spec fic feminist anthology Sisters of the... 
Also lined up @aptshadow's Guns of the Dawn (the ebook version which takes up less space than the impressive hardcover :) )
Catching up on reading: @matociquala's Shattered Pillars and Steles of the Sky. just discovered I'd read a bunch of novellas in this world
@LAGilman :)
@RozKaveney aw thanks, Roz! Much appreciated.
This is for @KariSperring @ines_evenstar  
@LAGilman oh. Nice.
@SheckyX @LAGilman having something book related there, I hope! (not sure what yet :) )
@LAGilman I like this plan. OK, that's officially my coping mechanism
@LAGilman plus, on pub day I'll be on my 3-plane journey to Spokane. Reckon I won't need to cope, I'll be so tired anyway :)
@LAGilman LOL you mean I'm not allowed to borrow inspiration from others? Darn...
@djolder thank you!
@fran_wilde :D :D congrats on the Locus review, btw! Just read it.
Awww 
@MaryRobinette aw thank you!
@KateElliottSFF November does feel far away (yes, I know. Totally logical)
@gmehn ugh yeah. Not friendly
@KateElliottSFF lol, in this particular case I suspect time will fly. August feels like tomorrow already!
@gmehn you should :) let me know if that happens again
@RosariumBill :) ha. Sympathies!
Proofs for House of Shattered Wings have arrived. Have I mentioned that it's starting to look like a real book? *scared* *excited*
New ghostwords post! " The aswang’s long, tubular tongue started snaking towards his navel."  
@gmehn come to Paris :)
@zenoagency oh yeah I saw an old edition of the Dream Master I think? Very... period :)
@maureenkspeller you write very strong reviews and I always enjoy reading them? (also sympathies!)

 
@PrinceJvstin *jealous*
@gmehn @SarahPinborough  food always included! Should ask @Mancunicon about local restaurants :)
@gmehn @SarahPinborough @Mancunicon :) part of the plan to take over the world
@zenoagency that is a really pretty cover
@MorganJLocke @AthenaHelivoy hahhaa yeah, it's nice to find out, but I don't assume it's a recent discovery (newspaper science...)
@KameronHurley I can imagine :)
@KameronHurley oooooh congrats!!!
@fran_wilde :( :( *hands over flamethrower*
@theefer ha. Yes. Very odd seen from non-UK countries :)
@MorganJLocke ok. Pretty darn cool. Thanks for sharing
How babies are shaped. Wow. 
@likhain HUGS
Review of Nuoc 2030, a movie set in the flooded Mekong delta 
@cstross


Someone has to publish this in Europe, please? 
@JustALilLost thank you! It's wonderful art by @NekroXIII (and art direction by @Adam_Auerbach)
Twitter is *not* practical for quotes... I've grouped them on the novel's webpage 
... Pathos and beauty intertwine in a novel filled with longing." 2/2 @MaryRobinette  
From @MaryRobinette "THE HOUSE OF SHATTERED WINGS exists in a rich, evocative Paris that is thick with magical history..." 1/2
@ce_murphy :) :) the things you learn
@irinarempt ah. That usually helps a lot. I scrabbled for chocolate when it happened and all I could find was cheese (which worked too)
Been a tad distracted: new ghostwords post 
@rcloenenruiz he, I can imagine. No pressure, when you have time :) *hugs*
@rcloenenruiz he, thanks! Definitely will
@rcloenenruiz can we have skeletons in your novella then? I'm sure you can learn lots of interesting things to inflict on your characters ^^
@rcloenenruiz sounds like the perfect outing ;)
@druchunas so the consensus says :) thank you!
@rcloenenruiz he's fine--we had a scary 15 minutes but all was well. It was genuinly more impressive than damaging :(
@rcloenenruiz animal skeletons?
@lizwithhat thank you!
@D_Evil_Overlord thank you! *hugs* (he's fine though!)
@mahveshm :)
@redrichie he did. It was kind of panic inducing for us (first time :( )
@lizwithhat he, thanks! He's quite fine :) (was eating cheese with relish. We figured it hadn't been that bad a scrape)
@Krasnostein ha. That time of life :)
@dnazproject ok, thank you!
@IndrapramitDas @charlesatan @scottlynch78 @tithenai @SofiaSamatar @rosefox @djolder @AnnVanderMeer @JonathanStrahan thank you!
@irinarempt he, thanks! Will apply tonight
@irinarempt oh wow. I imagine toddler was furious
@xa329 ok, thank you! No sun here, we're fresh out, but will apply cold water
@ce_murphy cool, thanks!
@ms_marques ok, thanks!
@rcloenenruiz *hugs* museum sounds like a good idea. Also have some cute animals? 
@crashwong thanks for the tweets. So much yes
@likhain @rcloenenruiz wow
@mahveshm it was listed on Locus for a while as being in May or June I think? While pub dates were being sorted out
@Ferrisindustry :) thank you!
@mahveshm he's fine, thanks, it was more impressive than serious (phew). And cold water. Noted
@mahveshm August 18th in the US and August 20th in the UK/RoW (we'd be hopelessly late if June!)
(he's doing fine! But the clothes he was wearing are not)
So. How do you wash dried blood from a jacket? Asking for a friend (hahaha not really. The snakelet split his lip open while falling)
@mahveshm galleys are at the end of the month I think? Will check how to get you one when we actually have them
Up, awake and running. #storyofmylife
@likhain @KateElliottSFF @alessahinlo @word_carpentry @ShvetaThakrar yes writing binges do that! I finished a short story!
@ghostwritingcow @didic @AceRocBooks and aw thank you!
@ghostwritingcow @didic @AceRocBooks I'm sure they can arrange something :) (let me know if there's an issue, I'll put in a word :) )
@likhain that always works! I'm trying to figure out what happens to my space station zombie
@likhain @KateElliottSFF @alessahinlo @word_carpentry @ShvetaThakrar go go go! (art or poetry?)
@ghostwritingcow @didic I'm a little hazy on planning, but I think @AceRocBooks is going to have ARCs soon? (end of the month)
@PrinceJvstin it's really good ^^
@likhain ^^a bit zonked out, but nothing that sleep didn't remedy :p how are you?
@MorganJLocke thank you!
@dancinghorse aw thank you!
@JonathanStrahan @EllenDatlow @JohnPicacio @JohnJosephAdams @torbooks thank you!
@corinneduyvis @BethCato thank you!
@charlesatan @scottlynch78 @tithenai @SofiaSamatar @rosefox @djolder @AnnVanderMeer @JonathanStrahan thank you!

@VictorOcampo hahaha thank you!
@likhain :) :) thank you!
@KateElliottSFF thank you!
@topgeargirl2 @pennyvixen @ann_leckie @KameronHurley @gailcarriger @matociquala thank you!
@likhain *waves* good morning!
@niallharrison yup. And so much stuff going on. Dense (in a good way)
@NeutrinoJones :) will add it to TBR list.
@RachelAnneMarks thank you :) :)
@patesden aw thank you Patty!
Next eastercon! At which @SarahPinborough @iannmcdonald @davecl42 and I are GoHs (and many fine people are coming!) 
@NeutrinoJones it's my first novel by her actually. I should catch up on the others
(I'm doing capsule reviews, all I have the energy for at the moment. At least reviewing does happen, even if less detailed than I'd like)
@niallharrison oh yes. Lots of very interesting things going on there, more or less subtly--not sure I got everything
@NeutrinoJones it's brilliant. Very dense, but brilliant.
@Canadian_Errant ha, thanks! I have the book it's in, it's just that we moved and I'm not 100% sure of where it is
@Canadian_Errant The Sea and Little Fishes? I should! Gotta hunt down that book though
@JohnPicacio @JohnJosephAdams @JonathanStrahan @EllenDatlow @torbooks thank you :)
(the fact that it never really went where I expected it to go, except in one case, is also pretty darn good. Go buy now)
... an awesome tapestry of characters (loved loved Tralane and her two daughters), and world building that just kills it 2/2
Really feel I have to go talk up @JustinaRobson's latest, GLORIOUS ANGELS, though. Effortlessly and exuberantly inventive, with... 1/2
OK, so book log. #discworldreread is still running late (gotta talk about Witches Abroad and Small Gods)
@2muchexposition congrats :) (but very well deserved)
@ruthmidget @garethlpowell thank you :)
@rcloenenruiz it was rather nice :)
@didic aw thank you :)

@rcloenenruiz get some rest :) *puts on fierce momma face*
Awww 
@JonOlivereditor *hugs* Exhaustion does make everything worse. I'm 100% confident you're a great parent

Many thanks to @SheilaWilliam10 and @JonathanStrahan respectively
I'm a finalist for 2 Locus Awards ("Memorials" in short story/"The Dust Queen" in novelette). I'll lie down about now 
@susan_lanigan @kyliu99 or you'll spend 10+ hours doing the writerly equivalent of debugging your own code #beenheredonethat
.@kyliu99 on lazy programmers. Hahaha yes 
@booksabound he, thanks! Was pleased to sell this one as it's rather long ^^
@booksabound he, thank you! For once I actually had time to put something together :)
@JamieFord :)
Up, awake and plotting zombies on a space station.
@KariSperring %%%% hugs
Oh. That is rather awesome 
@KateElliottSFF @D_Libris I'd read that
@bogo_lode Peter's Fish. And prawns. Yum.
Fish with squid ink and spaghetti! #fisheater #easytoplease
Currently in moderately fancy restaurant having a foodie heaven moment
@msagara :) here from Tuesday to Sunday midday. You?
@tadethompson @TheNerdsofColor I'm having trouble believing that nobody thought it'd be a problem :( :(
@rcloenenruiz @matociquala sending many hugs too. They're belated but they have a shorter way to go!
@tadethompson @TheNerdsofColor ninjas and sweatshops? Wow (not in a good way)
@VictorOcampo @likhain thank you! Got 10 hours and feel much better...
@NeutrinoJones quite possibly...
@LAGilman urk :( :(
@dnazproject @kyliu99 thank you!
@EdwardCox10 :) thanks!
@likhain @VictorOcampo :) I don't know if productive counts, since I ended up playing with farm animals and children's books
@MorganJLocke thank you!
@Keltounet :)
@SheckyX or when they're being born...
@KateElliottSFF @StevenGould @MorganJLocke I'm hungry now!
The best part of holidays is when the snakelet finally sleeps, everybody gets up late, and I have a quiet morning with a mug of tea
@rcloenenruiz arg no :( :( so sorry. Hope you can get it fixed
@TheSFReader oh I have no doubt...
@likhain *hugs*
Omg sleep. 10 hours! #motherhood
@D_Libris :)
@D_Libris you're famous!
@ce_murphy sympathies. Am eating while nervously waiting for cries from the cot to die down
@msagara just learnt you were going to Worldcon this year? Hope to meet up? (I'll take my books :) )
@scottlynch78 may luck attend thee
@KameronHurley word.
Oh. Royal baby on the way, I assume (I log onto twitter and FB first, and then check the news. My view of them is... interesting)
@LAGilman :(
@EdwardCox10 urk. Sorry to hear that (it doesn't sound like fun at all) and hope it gets better soon
@VictorOcampo @likhain yay writing! Am catching up on emails and planning a story
@likhain :) rest is good too!
@MarkGerrits :) :) glad it's working!
@green_knight ha. I've not tried it, to be honest (haven't worked from an existing file yet)
@rcloenenruiz @kyliu99 thank you!
(Yeah, I know. Twitter again not ideal for this. I'll get the website updated Monday)
@likhain ha. Now you can be up all night :) (sympathies though. Having your sleep cycle messed up is no fun)
..."and beautiful - often at the same time.  When I had to put this book down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again." 3/3 @LAGilman
set in a Paris that is both instantly recognizable and yet utterly alien, peopled by characters grotesque, broken, ..." 2/3
"de Bodard's The House of Shattered Wings is thoughtful, complex, and engrossing, a fantastical thriller..." 1/?
"A subtle, hugely enjoyable, mix of fallen angels and human frailty." @tomlloydwrites
"A fascinating and elegant mystery set in the fractured mirror of an alternate Paris." 1/2
..complex, layered characters infused with de Bodard's unique awareness of the flow of currents of power in a colonial landscape" @kyliu99
"Lyrical, sophisticated, lush, suspenseful—HOUSE OF SHATTERED WINGS brings to life an exciting world of deep magic and..." 1/2
@JonathanStrahan ooooooh. Tease :)
@charlesatan :) thank you!
(will post them later, because copy pasting from one application to another in a tablet is just a headache I don't want to deal with)
Oooh quotes from @LAGilman @kyliu99 @tomlloydwrites for HOUSE OF SHATTERED WINGS. I am truly blessed with awesome friends
@GillianRedfearn ah. Yes, prolonged soaking essential! Hope no stains
@fran_wilde @MeganofBlushie ha. I wrote a lot of the draft while on the metro, so there was a lot of "commuting crowd" soundtrack, too :)
@silviamg urk, sorry. Fingers crossed they can do something about it.
@fran_wilde @MeganofBlushie :)) I was on Bat for Lashes, Girlyman, and the sound track to Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood...
@fran_wilde @MeganofBlushie yup, same here. But I do use concept art to launch off a story (or poetry. Go figure).
@GillianRedfearn ha. Parents often have a point ;) (also, eep. Red wine? It's hard to get out of clothes...)
@silviamg can you report them to twitter? is that a violation of their TOS?
@MeganofBlushie @fran_wilde ha. I'm not enough of a visual person to use it while drafting. I need music at that stage :)
@GeekMelange oooh yes mine too.
@amberdine :)) happy writing!
@MeganofBlushie @fran_wilde ha. I actually use it after the fact, or long before (as a starting point, or after I'm done with draft)
@fran_wilde great minds... :)
@mushenska funnily enough, I don't panic when it's a. English and b. my last name, because plenty practise. Any other case: just full panic
#ff @KatWithSword who writes awesome fiction (and with a large spread of subgenres/voices too!)
@switkowski ha. Doctor Who for the snakelet is going to be a bit later, I reckon...
@Gnashchick aw thank you! I hope there'll be copies (the book comes out August 18 from @AceRocBooks, so it'll def. be available)
For anyone wondering: THE HOUSE OF SHATTERED WINGS Pinterest board, aka inspiration for upcoming novel (August 2015!) 
@fran_wilde @PrinceJvstin @hawkwing_lb @locusmag ooooooooh....
@fran_wilde @APIARYmagazine @geekadelphia @Tmoms @rnmelton @ShvetaThakrar officially jealous now
@msagara :( poor youngest. It's horrible when they're sick (ours does fall asleep in my arms when he has a cold. He's heavy now!)
@fran_wilde I know... *squee*
Last RT, OMG (I'm a great admirer of @johnpicacio so that means a lot to me)
@JohnPicacio aw thank you so much! I love your work, and would be honored if a cover by you happened :)
@adribbleofink I'm worried, too, I confess. But trying to be optimistic, because I feel like I need happy things today....
Can I put in a wish for more sleep? 90% of last night: rocking snakelet to sleep. Nap time was the same. #runningoncaffeine
LRT: I love @Ben_Aaronovitch's books. Urban fantasy that makes London come to life.
@Gollancz have a good weekend! Here we're already on holiday courtesy of International Workers' day
#ff @likhain awesome artist, heartbreakingly good poet (and OMG she just opened an etsy shop!)
@rcloenenruiz hahaha fingers crossed!
@adribbleofink oh. I didn't even know there was going to be a movie! Nice to see so many SFF classics made into movies
Awesome worldbuilding, and wonderful characters that feel real @KariSperring
Also, if you haven't read @karisperring's The Grass King Concubine and/or Living with Ghosts, you're missing out on some awesome sauce
#ff @karisperring, awesome writer, kindest of souls and kickass human being
@zenaldehyde :( :( sorry to hear that. Many hugs your way
Last RT: oooh happy book day to @matociquala @AquilaRift @geoffryman, three wonderful writers
@tomlloydwrites looking forward to it!
@tomlloydwrites ah ok. Sounds like useful stuff
@tomlloydwrites ah, ok
@KVJohansen @tomlloydwrites I like the Secret Life of Contracts :)
@boygainvillea they kind of make me want to run away screaming :(
@stephanieburgis :) hugs
@stephanieburgis *sends noises of waves and feeling of sun on skin*
@tomlloydwrites he. Contracts explanations can be hugely useful. Is that something you're planning to teach soon?
Right. Had three mugs of tea. Starting to feel human again. And, yet, somehow, keep trying to type QWERTY-style on an AZERTY keyboard
@tomlloydwrites aww thank you :))
@crashwong w00t!!!! also, penguindrum!
@charlesatan :)
Right, off to either do some writing or get some more sleep
@likhain :)
@ZucchiniBikini ah. Urk. Servicing can be so problematic
@charlesatan thank you for storifying! I'd tweet more, but I'm just too tired :)
@charlesatan @CherylMorgan @Paul_Cornell here too (May 1st is a holiday)
@HaralambiMarkov quite fine otherwise!
@HaralambiMarkov I didn't sleep at all last night because the snakelet couldn't sleep and I ended up rocking him in my arms, but that's all
(of course, it's morally wrong, and some people do stand up for other ideals. But it's like Omelas: very very few do)
Horror (well, one of them) of empire is this: most ppl think that all of this is natural. That it's due to them, that other ppl deserve it
And that the large majority of people don't know what is happening and would ask for it to be stopped if they did
A pernicious myth of empire is that its horrors (systematic discrimination, pillaging of resources, etc.) are only perpetuated by bad people
Warning: slight rant coming
@HaralambiMarkov glad to hear it :)
Typing on ipad plus apple wireless keyboard. Not bad, insofar as these things go. Severe limitations though (no file system and no mouse)
@rosefox :) I think that book made a huge impression on me
Up, awake (barely, thank God for tea), and watching snakelet pull things apart #businessasusual
@LouMorgan ooooh congrats, hope you have fun!
@halleluyang ah. That could be a problem...
@HaralambiMarkov *waves* good morning and hope you're OK? Here a bit frazzled through lack of sleep but OK otherwise
@ZucchiniBikini oh no, so sorry to hear that. Hope you can get it fixed? *hugs if you need/want them*
@ramez oooh. That's exciting. not quite there, but getting there
@rosefox :) more and more I think 12-year-old me was wise beyond belief (I used to not want to grow up to not have adult responsibilities)
@likhain yes!
@StevenBrust so totally and scarily accurate. Or "while the writer was working out a plot point"
@VictorOcampo oooh congrats!
@GeekMelange @djolder @nkjemisin @crashwong @Nnedi aw thank you!
@elquesogrande1 @dnazproject @odo @MLeticiaLara there's a bunch of Latino folks, but yes, not easy to find
@johannthors thank you for the signal boost!
@charlesatan @KariSperring *waves* good afternoon Charles, good morning Kari
SO pretty. @likhain 
@likhain @alessahinlo @KateElliottSFF @word_carpentry @ShvetaThakrar oh wow. That is so so pretty. I love how you use colour washes
@likhain just being your awesome self, I would say :)
Sending love and support to @KariSperring, who is a wonderful human being
@EPBeaumont hahaha love when you put it that way :)
@EPBeaumont ha, I know the feeling. I comfort myself with the knowledge that there's a sequel in the works!
Last RT: The Grass King's Concubine is awesome @EPBeaumont
Woke up to a lovely blurb for House of Shattered Wings by @LAGilman *squee*
Oooooh. No idea if it's Spanish-language or Latino? cc @MLeticiaLara @odo @dnazproject (for plugging Supersonic?) 
@MorganJLocke @likhain :) let me know how it comes out! (my mom says it's pretty good if you brew lightly, 80°C water and 1:30-2 mins)
@stephanieburgis that would be awesome
@KariSperring hugs and please take care of yourself.
@lavietidhar ooooooh awesome, congrats!
Awwww  
Darn, you get all the good stuff over in Bristol. Say hi to Em and Pete for me please?  
@ramez urk, sorry to hear that. Get well soon.
@KariSperring distinctly pissed off here.
@likhain @Eve_Shi :) so glad it arrived safely! It's Vietnamese tea, so hopefully the best in the world :p
@charlesatan @GillianRedfearn ha, best of luck with the office move! Always an experience...
@KariSperring wtf. just. no. *sends all the hugs*
The Beginning of Chinese Science Fiction 
One-liners that Sum Up Parenthood Perfectly 
@mikaela_l they were my editing arcs, so no, not that much...
Just found the notes for House of Shattered Wings with the character arcs for the entire book. Didn't even know I had these!
@EmApocalyptic LOL. This is priceless, thanks
@EmApocalyptic no I haven't! where?
UK politicians with GoT quotes. I just broke down and laughed hysterically 
Hey, I missed that @Gollancz got a European Science Fiction Society Award--congrats! 
@michaeldthomas @lynnemthomas :( sending hugs
@hawkwing_lb it totally counts!
@hawkwing_lb @tordotcom ooooh so cool, congrats!
@BT_Musings aw thank you!
A reminder it's not too late to subscribe to my mailing list :) Newsletter goes out tomorrow at 11:45pm my time 
@agfitzp yeah. Some terrific stufft hat season
@RickNovy er. The one with David Tennant. I didn't watch much Doctor Who before Christopher Eccleston...
Writing... sort of happened? I have actually planned the May newsletter! With map of Paris and excerpt from novella 
@stephanieburgis there's just moments when you need to grab a favorite book...
Ooooh congrats @fran_wilde! 
@stephanieburgis it's hilarious. I'm onto Small Gods as a comfort read.
Also, having spilled a glass of milk, a mug of tea and a glass of water today, I think I'll stick to typing on the iPad for now
10 hours with snakelet and now I think I'm ready to watch episodes of Doctor Who Season 3. Sounds about right
@tithenai @visyap @crashwong @UncannyMagazine ooooohhhhh
@RFLong @camilleregan @ce_murphy I wish so too...
@ms_emmalyon yeah, my thoughts exactly
@LAGilman I discovered tons of new artists in the last eighteen months alone...
@electricland :)
@dancinghorse @KateElliottSFF I think it's because they used spottily users, not really representative
@RFLong I know the feeling.. Hugs
@GeekMelange @UncannyMagazine yes please
…
@RachelAnneMarks :)
@ms_emmalyon it feels off
@gmehn yeah feels very weird
@R_Emrys :)
You stop listening to new music at age 33, earlier for parents 
Listening to @DarWilliamsTour's new release, Emerald. Whee.
Mark Ruffalo being awesome.  
The audiobook of @MaryRobinette's Of Noble Family sounds fantastic 
Love social media for connecting me with great artists
@RickNovy he, yes
@JAHite yeah, my feelings, pretty much
Random Islamophobia aka "long skirts are totally religious attire". W.T.F. 
@D_Libris @GillianRedfearn @saladinahmed (Charleville Mézières is in the east of France, not particularly known for diversity)
@D_Libris @GillianRedfearn @saladinahmed the French media don't mention a school uniform or dress code. Sounds like bigotry, pure &amp; simple
@ms_emmalyon in the making :)
@D_Libris ha. Put your hands in dough and get them wet and sticky? I reckon that's anytime, insofar as he's concerned
@Jess_Wade you'd think he'd read the book :)
@thelionmachine yup, I reckon we're well on the way to having a little gourmet at home
He, I've been picked up by @DunnettCentral. Achievement unlocked :) 
The snakelet is inexplicably fascinated by my "how to bake bread" book. He points at various loaves of breads and demands explanations
@AdamShaftoe ha. I can imagine that'd be potent
@prgodbarebones oooh. Thought so. I want to compare it to nuoc mam now :)
@prgodbarebones ha. Just googled it. Now that'd be interesting, indeed
@likhain @RoseLemberg @rcloenenruiz @KariSperring @KateElliottSFF HUGS and thank you so much. Hope the studio is awesome :) :)
@likhain of course! Always happy to help
And if you can't patreon, go bid at @con_or_bust :) 
Please consider patreoning @likhain? She creates gorgeous art 
@mushenska :( usually at that stage I move to comic book reading or light email
@AdamShaftoe he. So what does it taste like? Msg, like the article says?
@LiangYalan ought to be a name for it :)
@halleluyang everything's better with dragons!
@maxgladstone @ann_leckie can I drop mine there too? I need a comfy place...
@ann_leckie ha, me too!
Oh my. Cover reveal for Liu Cixin's Death's End, last in the three-body trilogy  
What did garum (Roman fish sauce) taste like? 
The awesome @McDougallSophia offers mentoring for writers 
(growing up, my spring rolls skills were so abysmal I was never allowed to touch the rice paper. Took me a lot of time to learn)
Brodard, the history of a family and community 
@GeekMelange he, thanks!
@GillianPolack oh yes
@susan_lanigan ha. Not very honest though...
@GillianPolack :( sympathies.
@stephanieburgis :) so glad I'm not the only one
@theloveofwords @replyall hahaha that's totally what I'm doing. Thanks!
@AlasdairStuart yeah, I reckon that's what matters (best of luck with inbox!)
@RFLong hahaha that's fair.
DO NOT OVERCOMMIT DO NOT OVERCOMMIT
@AlasdairStuart yeah, that's what I do too. It's just I feel so terribly embarrassed, but it's not fair to people to just ignore
@schanoes he. Glad I'm not the only one
@mikaela_l *hugs* I haven't forgotten you!
@RFLong ha, thanks. Unused to this amount of overload...
(my opinion is that I'd rather answer, but wow I feel like hiding :s)
That awkward moment when you wonder if it's better to answer an email 6 months afterwards, or to just let it die
@matociquala :(
Post-Worldcon to now was basically a long blur of work stress, real life snakelet handling and straining to meet novel deadlines, arg
If you were waiting for a response for me and didn't get anything for months, I didn't mean to ignore you :( :( it's just not much free time
Oh dear lord. Digging into the inbox and looking at all the balls I dropped.
Makes me want to reread Parable of the Sower 
Right. Sorting out things to do today. Pleased that yesterday I managed to turn in something early :)
@Gollancz @JonCG @LordGrimdark and a moat. And spikes
@gilibugg not sure to what extent,but there's the same phenomenon here. Lots of local children's books do very well
@gilibugg the sff shelves of my local bookstore can be a depressing adventure...
@gilibugg *nod* that was my feeling as well. Sff very homogenous still, dunno if historical reasons or something else
@ms_marques printer not working, basically...
@stephanieburgis ooh congrats! Always a relief
@gilibugg do you have the same experience with sff?

@garethlpowell story of my life vs word's spell checker...
@likhain @crashwong spam anytime :)))
@IzzySpirit5 ooh ok thank you! Going to try
@crashwong @likhain :))) squeeing for you
@likhain !!!! awesome!
@Keltounet urk :(
@derGullen :) I have one and no idea where the blazes it is :( (bought it while pregnant, never got to reading it, now lost it)
And, hum, stupid question, but does anyone else have trouble with Yosemite and Canon printers? (both parents and I have it)
Putting the house upside down to locate copy of Jack Vance's Lyonesse. Apparently not succeeding. Darn, might have got lost in move
LOL 
@likhain @RoseLemberg @zenaldehyde @KateElliottSFF @halleluyang oooooh wow. So much art. So pretty.
Giving power to the powerless by @zenaldehyde 
@pastellistin @Grrrod @agfitzp he, sure. I'm probably going to play a bit with software :)
@pastellistin @Grrrod @agfitzp he, thanks! Coincidentally, that's the one I printed and used as a basis for the hand drawn one :)
.@tlmorganfield on the importance of reviews to authors. Yup. 
@Grrrod @agfitzp @pastellistin too detailed :( (I needed 1900 Paris map + vague outline of streets).
@agfitzp @pastellistin @Grrrod oh fair point. I'd need to create a bitmap though (couldn't find anything that worked so I ended up drawing)
@LAGilman he. I get them flipped too (I totally avoided referring to them in the novel for fear of looking silly...)
@kyliu99 lol will email you :)
@Grrrod he yeah, I have gimp. Very newbie with it though...
@fran_wilde oooooooh you should!
@kyliu99 ? To whom? Readers?
@Grrrod and move stuff around with GIMP maybe? Or give up :)
@Grrrod I've seen mapmaking software but they're mostly focused on terrain? Other solution=draw map of city as background
Ok, this one looks slightly better. For marginal values of "slightly". #shatteredwings #novel 
@Grrrod fast learning curve and reasonable price much appreciated :)
@Grrrod yeah, that would require some actual map making software though...
This is why I took up writing and not, say, painting... Map of Paris w/ major locations of the novel #shatteredwings 
@kyliu99 @KateElliottSFF @wes_chu as a datapoint I upgraded the desktop and no issues, but it has 8GB of RAM
Mishear twice: "Sorry?"
Mishear again: "Haha, yes, exactly"
@kyliu99 @KateElliottSFF what ken said, no issues this end. Except if you have a canon printer, the drivers aren't out...
@BenGalley :)
On Harriet Vane and Lord Peter Wimsey oooooh 
@agfitzp :) I know my limits. There are reasons why I'm writing and not doing graphical design
@KateElliottSFF @john_chu @jdiddyesquire really? Oh wow. Have to look at this. Word for Mac is... fiddly...
@crashwong :p
@dolohov it kind of looked finished?
@dolohov well, I suck at drawing. So once I finished blocking in the major streets and putting the rough locations of everyone
I cannot believe I just spent 30 minutes drawing a rough map of Paris with the locations of all the major Houses in the novel. *sigh*
@JulietteWade urk, so sorry about the family crisis. Sending very best wishes (and all the hugs)
Ie just ordered a keyboard and an incase origami stand (thanks to everyone who recommended one), and we'll see!
On the downside, I have to wait for them to deliver the new battery, so I'll be without a laptop for a while
Update on the computer: the battery is dead and the motherboard is kind of flaky, but repairs are cheaper than new laptop, so...
@KateElliottSFF @bogiperson yes. So much this.
@zenaldehyde <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@dianagill @zenaldehyde I read it in 2 days. Such a breath of fresh air, and the ending was a sheer delight
(RE the @zenaldehyde book, I have read it! Magic and mayhem in Regency England, such fun! And dragons of course :p)
@zenaldehyde and so fierce ^^
The cover for @zenaldehyde's awesome Sorcerer to the Crown revealed over @BNSciFi 
@zenaldehyde OMG. OMG. That is so striking!!!
@Keltounet :)
@PrinceJvstin @fantasycafe thank you!
@Tsana_D thank you!
@silvanhistorian aw thank you!
(I'm also severely out of spoons due to the middle of night wakeup. The feed might unexpectedly switch to kittens and otters)
I'm @fantasycafe talking about ignored narratives in fiction (and Dorothy Dunnett!) 
#TheDevourers@IndrapramitDas htt…
@aptshadow I take it secret floors in some evil scientist's lair aren't an option?
@stephanieburgis w000t!!!
(possibly will scan the map and put it on website after that, or something)
OK. Craft project to relax after copy-edits: finally putting all the Houses on the same map of Paris
Ooooh happy book day @MaryRobinette!  
@corinneduyvis :) happy birthday!
@charlesatan @casskhaw there is one exception, which is that if a language has a better word for a concept I'll automatically switch to that
@JonCG so. Pretty
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @KariSperring @wordfey it is lovely
Oooh Rivers of London comic. That is awesome 
@Krasnostein w0000t!!!!!
@AllenOzwriter a very hungry one, apparently... (the snakelet=my son)
@Krasnostein ah. Ours does that early in the morning and I'm definitely not up. Sending much much willpower and strength
@riajuunibyou I'm pretty sure toddlerhood is like the adolescence of babies :)
@dancinghorse fair point. He'll get the tone if nothing else...
@Krasnostein yeah. Sympathies--hope yours isn't too bad...


@dancinghorse he. I feel it'll be some months (or years) before the threat is actually understood though!
@gileadslostson awwwww that's cute :)
Woken up in middle of the night by snakelet. Is this the time to regret dedicating the novel to him?
@dancinghorse @KateElliottSFF @msagara I'm with Judith. Happy with fealty ^^
:( :( 
Ooooh dinosaurs! 
@gilibugg LOL. I've found the picture where he sits on the throne with the sword across his lap. Not inaccurate :)
@KateElliottSFF @msagara I want one too. Can we have fidelity cards?
Edmund is a good man. What a mess :( :(  
.@KariSperring @jolantru @wordfey being awesome 
"stories that derive from my culture have been gnawed to the bone, bones broken open and marrow extracted, and fed back to me as mush"
@ctjhill @ClaireRousseau no, it's pronounced "loo-ie"
Oh, also, I had a lovely meeting with @corinneduyvis! (whom I almost forgot in the rush of c-editing. Bad writer :( )
@shellbryson I'm choosing to believe that :)
So what do I do when I'm tired and completely brain dead? I pin lots of things to the book's pinterest board 
@CamMeze awww thank you! Hope you enjoy it :)
@crashwong @kyliu99 @SarahPinsker @john_chu @fran_wilde caramel party FTW!
@kyliu99 @SarahPinsker @john_chu @fran_wilde I can probably arrange something :)
Wow. Tech support spammers 
@ClaireRousseau @ctjhill yeah, same here. Never saw the episode...
@LiangYalan hahaha I think the house is a bit far :)
@KeithAManuel he, thanks
@john_chu @SarahPinsker @fran_wilde @kyliu99 I can bring over caramel, too :)
W000t! @crashwong  
Those tweets by @KateElliottSFF over whether writing ever gets easier are awesome 
Brain: fried. Couscous: cooking. *keels over* I think it's time for that season of Elementary
@kyliu99 @john_chu me me me!!
Oh congrats @SarahPinborough ! 
An interview with @scriptopus!  
@Keltounet loved Anubis Gates.
@Keltounet yup
@AdamShaftoe thank you!
Now back to @JustinaRobson's "Glorious Angels". Really love Tralane and her interactions with her daughters
Finished "Last Call", and wow. I'm not a poker person, but the gambling/probabilties were breathtaking. Also, Vietnamese character FTW!
I'm sorry, what? I'm not sure how "earning less than 35hours on minimum wage" is an equivalent of "slacking off" 
@GillianRedfearn :(
@ronnidolorosa welcome back!
@SCyFlynn @charlesatan @kyliu99 I vote for tea :). Or possibly obliterated dead, for my enemies :p
@zola_the_gorgon KJ Parker is Tom Holt :)
@wartrader oh LOL. That is priceless
(please ignore last tweet. Not trying to promo spam, just needed to repin the tweet with the cover image)
Upcoming novel! Fallen angels, washed-out alchemist, Vietnamese immortal in devastated Paris 
@ce_murphy awwww
@ian_sales deduce what you want about my information management skills :)
@rcloenenruiz I was going to suggest breaking it in two... sounds like you've got too much material... (a good thing!)
At least I found out about KJ Parker along with everyone else :) (even a bit early)
Uh. It's probably a mark of how consumed by childcare + novel I've been that I only find out now that Claire North is Catherine Webb
@likhain oooh arroz caldo. ALL THE HUGS and get some rest
@crashwong ^^ there's a word for Western vampires, too, but it's not the same
@swan_tower ah, ok. Makes sense then, you definitely want variety
Forgot to tweet about this, but @stvgskll @tomaslmartin have got a cool Sci-Fi Miniatures wargame up for funding 
@swan_tower I tend to use the same CD over and over again when writing, for months at a time (the latest one is Wind Horse by Anda Union)
Today's word in Vietnamese: cương thi (=jiangshi). We live and learn :)
@Gollancz
@rcloenenruiz thank you! And go go go, you can do it for the column
@KateElliottSFF @BrianTMcClellan it was! (fascinating what works outside US vs inside US...)
@ruthmidget :) thanks
@MLeticiaLara er. I'm thinking Mars or the Moon
Oooh 
@MLeticiaLara still hiding ;)
@charlesatan :( some day! (was really sorry to miss the WFC where you went. Now I have to go to Manila and eat all the food ^^)
@rcloenenruiz go go go!
@rcloenenruiz hahaha. I was up at 7 and I don't need to leave until 08:15
@crashwong :) :)
Just sign me up. Right now :D :D 
Ooooh. Three-Body Problem doing very well indeed 
@jolantru :)
@jolantru ooooooooooh
@KateElliottSFF 
@bethwodzinski thank you!
@mikaela_l :) thanks!
5 Filipino speculative authors to watch for 
@jolantru thank you *hugs*
Sent off manuscript after reviewing copy edits.*collapses* I think I'll have that tea now.
@maxgladstone aw thank you!
@KateElliottSFF @bethwodzinski urk. Best of luck with these :( three a day is a lot, but you can do it!
@KateElliottSFF :D :D
@usmantm yup. Be well and see you at the Nebs!
Ok, now to dig myself out of the pile of emails I didn't answer for the past week...
@TheKalebRussell thank you!
Just read something from @MLeticiaLara (with much delay) that made me blush and hide
I am done with copy edits
@kyliu99 @amberdine eeep. Best of luck with the debugging and hope the weekend involves some stuff without bugs
@JulietEMcKenna oooooh congrats!
3 chapters to go. Arg. I need a tea. And the snakelet has woken up anyway.
@bbeaulieu thanks, Brad. Will be glad to be done with this :)
5 chapters to go. #amediting
@fran_wilde @SarahPinsker @lynnemthomas or more sugar
@lynnemthomas @fran_wilde sounds like a good retreat then. It doesn't count if you haven't eaten bodyweight in sugar or chocolate or both
@fran_wilde @lynnemthomas :) :) hope you're having fun! *jealous*
Right. *rolls up sleeves* Going to finish this pass.
"...break free in a welter of beaks and blood-soaked claws – but Morningstar merely smiled." 2/2 #wip
"Philippe's chest – it, too, felt as though it was going to pull apart, as if the storm of crows roiling within was going to..." 1/2 #wip
@rcloenenruiz big big hugs. Do not let go or fall silent. You matter
@HeroesInColor00 :)
@canadiansuzanne :)
@canadiansuzanne he, thanks! It's the progress of the desperately late ^^
Moving from V-pop to La Oreja de Van Gogh
17 chapters/24 #amediting
15 chapters. Arg.
@cstross though the food options still suck :(
@cstross ha. Yes, I'd forgotten you were in my neck of the woods! 2E is OK since they refurbished it, yeah
I should give myself point for every Chinese/Vietnamese legend I managed to discuss in this book
@jolantru if you need the rest, you should
@cstross :( depends on the terminal...
And this other character is such a wet sop, as Granny Weatherwax would say--not very practical, but heart so much in the right place
"She would rather be dead than be seen with a less than perfect outfit." Poor character spends lot of book dressing up in state of panic :p
Copy editing. V-pop FTW.
Same, just saw the news this morning. Tragic loss :(  
@theefer yeah, if it was just me I'd stick to Scrivener or some other open source alternative :)
@rcloenenruiz brunch is good!
@theefer the industry uses Word? The Track Changes and other features of the document...
@sjwthehacker yeah, I feel all powerful!
@rcloenenruiz 12 chapters done, and I'm off to the market ^^ You done with breakfast?
10 chapters done. I've finally won my fight against Word after 30 minutes of serious battling.
@camilleregan hmmm, we'd need a sample datapoint from Germany :) (I've never been and don't read German...)
@gilibugg yeah, I can understand. It's a bit odd
@bogo_lode he. And I have the USB one and I really like it
@Matthewsrotundo *hefts flamethrower* You're right :)
@lizwithhat he. Hadn't paid attention when I was (very briefly) in Ireland. But true.
@jjmerelo no, will check it out, but since I need Track changes...
@AdeleHaze I can imagine...
@agfitzp oh, ok. thanks!
@irinarempt ha. I need Word for track changes anyway :(
@afishtrap @zenaldehyde ^^ thank you!
@KateElliottSFF aw thank you!
@rcloenenruiz :) he's a good kid
"...the faint smell of food and perfume, their mingling turning vaguely sickening." 3/3 #wip
"...without their magnificent clothes, the empty bottles and the glimmer of shattered glass, ..." 2/3 #wip
"They were all waiting for her in the ballroom, amid the cadavers of last night’s excesses: the tables lying bare..." 1/? #wip
@rcloenenruiz OMG that is so cute
@rcloenenruiz I'm having breakfast now :)
Up, awake and writing. Well, copy editing.
@rcloenenruiz go go go! I'm on if you need company :)
Ten chapters. Arg. #amediting
@rantalica thanks!
Currently fighting MS Word. I'm afraid it's winning.
@john_chu @kyliu99 ha. So that's one that's not like the French ^^
@lizwithhat ha. Spain is like that too. Wonder if the UK isn't the outlier in Europe?
@katherine_jay thanks. Will find out on Tuesday and then decide what to do, I reckon...
@kyliu99 it does make me wonder about other countries. Looks like Spain reads like France.
@gilibugg yes! It drives the H crazy. I'm just used to it (we had a lot of English and French books growing up...)
@ArmelDagorn it does, but I've got used to it (it drives the H crazy though!)
@charibdys @kyliu99 he, I can understand. I gave up and just read upside down
@KGOrphanides I still prefer by subject, and don't mind upside down!
@ClaireRousseau ha yeah, we're mixed. It's too complicated to keep separating them...
@gilibugg you read the US/UK ones from right to left. The French ones are left to right
@katherine_jay yeah, I took the laptop into a repair shop to see the damage extent. All going to depend on what they tell me
@kyliu99 see next tweet! they're basically mirror images of each other. The French just read the other way...
(just in case you were wondering: US/UK are read from right to left, the French ones from left to right)
Sorting out the bookcases. Having the silly reflections that the French and the US/UK really have a different idea of spines
@LiangYalan :( thanks
@bogo_lode yeah, would go mostly for storage. Not really interested in system functions though, just normal sized keys
@EMAldred @cstross thanks!
@NashPhenix @cstross oh. that's interesting.. Thanks!
@katherine_jay I've had a lot of recs for it. If the laptop's toast that's going to be my next port of call...
@KlaraKimStories he, thanks!
@john_chu @Tsana_D @cstross ha. I probably want an Apple keyboard to be honest, easier to find before we leave on hols
@LiangYalan thanks. It was 2 years old :(
@henryszabranski oh. That does look fabulous. Thank you for the pictures!
@katherine_jay ok, thank you! Going to see if I can try that set up.
@johannthors @cstross great, thank you!
@john_chu @Tsana_D ha. @cstross mentioned the TextBlade too. Will go read up.
@cstross @ScrivenerApp ha, ok, thanks! I'm waiting too, but not exactly keen to put money in a new laptop right now...
@likhain OMG OMG OMG so happy for you! *flails*
@Blackmudpuppy thank you!
@Tsana_D airport and hotel are about the favourite candidates for use, yeah
@Tsana_D ooooh that's nice, thanks!
So... anyone using a combination of bluetooth keyboard and iPad to write while on the move? Any recs? (@cstross?)
@asymbina thank you!
@halleluyang thank you!
@Blackmudpuppy I've seen! Going to depend what I can easily get since we're leaving for a holiday in 2 weeks...
@visyap @JulietteWade thank you!
@sharonlangridge he, thanks! Right now I'm updating my backup, just to be sure. I'll try the... more dangerous stuff afterwards
@Blackmudpuppy currently doing that, yeah. And investigating if I can get a bluetooth keyboard + iPad for travelling
@Blackmudpuppy urk :(
so good news bad news: tea drenched MacBook Air starts up. The battery is completely dead (as in, take off power cable, laptop turns off)
@msagara @KateElliottSFF @kyliu99 @markokloos :'(
@msagara @KateElliottSFF @kyliu99 @markokloos wow. By pulling it on the floor?
@msagara @KateElliottSFF @kyliu99 @markokloos oh really? Hadn't noticed. I like the mag safe; very handy with children...
@KateElliottSFF you are mighty
@KateElliottSFF @kyliu99 @markokloos the Air has 2 USB ports, I generally use 1 to connect the phone and one for the hard disk...
@KateElliottSFF @kyliu99 @markokloos ha. I have to admit the new one doesn't really tempt me because no ports
@KateElliottSFF @kyliu99 @markokloos I have the Air which is 1.4kg? Pretty light already and the keyboard is reasonable.
First pass of copy edits done. Now to let it rest before rereading #amediting #shatteredwings
20 chapters done #copyediting (well, almost 20 chapters. I'm sorting out the smaller things first. Still have another pass after that)
@ghostwritingcow @cindypon @zenaldehyde Sherlock Holmes working out relationships in a British university is just sheer brilliance
@ghostwritingcow @cindypon @zenaldehyde ha. The Angela one made me cry, so it wins :) The Suet Swain in her collection was awesome
@ghostwritingcow @cindypon @zenaldehyde I preferred the Angela one? But this one is good too!
@crashwong let me lend you some of our night :)
@cindypon oooh I love this one. @zenaldehyde writes fiction that makes you smile
@AthenaHelivoy no spoilers please :)
Got season 2 of Elementary, looking forward to it! Agree with @AthenaHelivoy it's a superb show, can't wait to watch S2
@Mord_Fiddle rights are the same though. novel contracts tend to be more complex? But could just be publisher
@Mord_Fiddle hum it really depends who's buying and what they're publishing as (standalone volume or as part of a magazine)?


@afishtrap @booksabound he, hope you enjoy it--very flattered to be a birthday present ^^
Aw thank you Tom! 
@booksabound awww thank you!
@KariSperring oops, sorry, will fix
@booksabound @tomlloydwrites @PrinceJvstin thank you!
@tomlloydwrites awww *blushes* *hides*
@Coliandre @ClaireRousseau @BragelonneFR ah ok, merci! Je note...
@ClaireRousseau @BragelonneFR @Coliandre ce sont des rééditions non? J'ai souvenir d'en avoir lu un il y a un moment?
Interview with Bae Suah, a Korean author whose book "Nowhere to Be Found" was recently released 
@booksmugglers ok, thanks! Will be by later :)
@NancyFulda rough sketch?
@didic @PrinceJvstin it is so cool. I feel like an excited kid
@booksmugglers just checking--can you submit something you're the author of? (no worries if not, I have other ideas ^^)
@PrinceJvstin aw thank you Paul--much appreciated ^^
SpecFic '15 Submissions now open: 
@jsuttonmorse aw thank you! It's all thanks to @Adam_Auerbach @NekroXIII
@kmkjensen thank you! @Adam_Auerbach @NekroXIII did wonderful work
@mossdogmusic aw thank you, glad you're enjoying it!
(sorry, twitter isn't great for this) I've put both quotes here on the book page 
"The House of Shattered Wings is one of those books; convincing, gripping and filled with wonders." 3/3 @KariSperring #shatteredwings
You walk its streets, smell its flowers, breathe its air alongside the characters as their stories become your story, their lives your life"
And the @KariSperring one: "A few times in a lifetime, a book comes along that wraps you completely in its world and its characters." 1/?
"...and shatters it, creating an original and fascinating world full of shadows, magic and intrigue." 2/2 @FredaWarrington #shatteredwings
The @FredaWarrington quote: "Brutal, beautiful, bold and brilliant. Aliette de Bodard takes the reality we know..." 1/2
@ce_murphy :( :( all the hugs. Can you apply again later?
@didic @ac_wise ha. I have not read Declare. I still prefer Anubis Gates but haven't finished Last Call
@kyliu99 :) we have zombies mopping it up (kindly summoned by the student roleplayers' association)
@Blackmudpuppy (and I've read Expiration Date, but it was so long ago I don't remember common points)
@Blackmudpuppy yup, I can see that! (Fisher King...)
@kyliu99  It's all that brain matter swirling in corridors :)
@rmltpie :)
@Blackmudpuppy I loved the Anubis Gates and Drawing of the Dark, but never read this one
(also, my alma mater, Ecole Polytechnique, is mentioned as one source of the magical theory, which is awesome :) )
Belatedly reading Tim Powers' Last Call. OMG magic with statistics I am in love
@likhain aw thank you! Galleys coming in a month's time apparently. Officially at the panic stage ^^
Seen today (well, yesterday): sample pages from House of Shattered Wings. Wow. Feeling of incoming real book (tm)
@PrinceJvstin @matociquala @NancyFulda (but I've never moderated, so there's probably lots of other ways to go about it)
@PrinceJvstin @matociquala @NancyFulda *nod* only way I've seen on panels is to direct questions their way and hope they'll get enthusiastic
The awesome @TheWorrierPoet (from @zenoagency) is over @UKTor chatting about his agent wishlist 
@PrinceJvstin @NancyFulda he. It's very useful stuff! I have zero interrupting skills and I need to work a bit on them
.@NancyFulda on moderating panels 
@likhain ooooh happy friday evening :)
@likhain :) do let me know!
@VictorOcampo (and let me know if there's any way I can help?)
@VictorOcampo *hugs* sending lots of good wishes and strength. Glad to see you back online
@likhain ooooooooh yay energy! And livepainting, oooh
and the VD13 workshop (@Ruth_Nestvold @GraysonMorrisNL @NancyFulda @jspock @akaSylvia). Yes, @akaSylvia read it twice :) 2/2
About the novella, I realise I forgot to thank @HaralambiMarkov @JulietteWade @akaSylvia (1/2)
@likhain :)
@cindypon so. cute.
Snakelet waving goodbye and attempting to say "bye bye": cutest thing ever
@mikaela_l hahaha thanks! No "arg" was panic because it's 9am here and I'm still at breakfast stage
@likhain awwww thank you HUGS
@NeutrinoJones :)
Up, awake, and arg.
The Telescoped Histories &amp; Myths of 'Game of Thrones:

@booksmugglers ooooh. OK. I might need to get tickets and a babysitter, then
@marc_tassin ^^ infallible
@marc_tassin hahaha I know the feeling (recently sent my book out for blurbs) Hope it passes soon (I found chocolate helped!)
@GemBeynon *hugs*
Eyes crossing after reviewing 10 chapters: check. Bedtime, methinks #amrevising
Ooooh. Oooh. An interview with @fran_wilde over her debut novel Updraft (published Sept 2015 by @torbooks)  
Oh wow. Happy birthday to Tom Doherty! 
Got lovely blurbs on the book from @KariSperring and @FredaWarrington, who both rock
Want to read something that never made it into House of Shattered Wings? Over here at Ghostwords! 
Dinner break. 12/24 chapters #amediting
*rolls up sleeves* *drinks tea* Time for copy edits.
New ghostwords post! 
"Fallen blood could be replenished; flesh, too, scabbed and scarred over; but bones never came back." 
@ms_emmalyon hahaha yes, I was reading @bengoldacre recently, and he makes the same point
@thelionmachine :) ha. If it doesn't work, generally it's faulty planning with me, too. I prefer to go back and redraft rather than revise
@thelionmachine ha. I brainstorm over and over and over, and then I rush out a first draft that I'm happy with
Hmm I'm actually a pretty good 1st drafter, but I don't mind rewriting. It's almost restful compared to 1st drafting 
@likhain hahaha thanks, gratefully received :D
@writersyndrome thx, I am having a very difficult afternoon :( :(
@joemts @matociquala because I'm not in the house, I'm at work :( :( (at home I've got 5 or 6 :) )
On "miracle cures". Nope, the entire medical establishment isn't engaged in a conspiracy to suppress cures 
@matociquala let me join in the screaming, on second thoughts...
@zenaldehyde ^^
@jolantru hugs
@matociquala they don't have 1 in my local store (I'm at work in the suburbs, which probably explains). Going to be a difficult afternoon...
@jolantru it's at my workplace, so no :(
@cathyclamp thank you!
@jolantru :(
@Eve_Shi it's at work, have no spare :(
Broke my tea infuser. #emergency
@Eve_Shi ^^
(Belated new ghostwords post!) 
"Jia Qi had been daydreaming, watching the colour leach out of the dark masses of the trees they drove past" 
@charlesatan thanks!
@StevenGould aw thank you so much for the RT on my cover!
Overwhelmed again. Yarg.
@NancyFulda he. Can't you follow the muse? (That's what I just did...)
@cindypon thank you!  <GROWING HEART>  <GROWING HEART>
@jolantru thank you *hugs*
7 chapters/24 #copyediting
@likhain @cindypon @rcloenenruiz @KateElliottSFF @ShvetaThakrar @jolantru oooooh they are so cute HUGS
Congrats @joemts on your promotion to Editorial Director! 
@ruthmidget thank you!
@katherine_jay thank you!
@RachelAnneMarks thank you!
@cindypon @RachelAnneMarks @KateElliottSFF @rcloenenruiz :) (you're awesome too, chicky! *hugs*)
@MangoHeroics thank you!
@thehidingspot @katherinebhowe @MadelineAshby @JustinSayreCHM ooooh, thank you!
Ooooh has the cover from @AceRocBooks!  
@cindypon @KateElliottSFF @rcloenenruiz ^^ hugs
@TheKalebRussell thank you!
@bogiperson ^^thank you!
@dolohov thank you!
@usmantm he. It was gorgeous (and I'm biased because of the theme,of course ^^)
@charlesatan sleep is the best...
@matociquala :) thanks!
@electricland thank you!
@hawkwing_lb thank you!
@NashPhenix ^^thank you!
@KDandenell thank you!
This novella by @usmantm is fantastic--memory, knowledge and what should be preserved 
Things to do: sleep. A lot. #zombiemodeon
@usmantm thank you!
@adribbleofink thank you!
@kevmcveigh thank you!
@wa7trel :) thank you!
@ghostwritingcow thank you!
@ShvetaThakrar thank you!
@rhiannonrevolts thank you!
@hierath77 thank you!
@CL_Hellisen :) thank you!
@PrinceJvstin thank you :)
@mangozoid thank you!
@kyliu99 thank you!
@Journeymouse thank you!
@lizwithhat thanks :)
@charlesatan thank you!
@stephanieburgis thank you!
@LiangYalan thank you!
@ms_emmalyon thank you!
@carolinehooton thank you!
@fran_wilde thank you!
(and, hum, for the curious, it's based on "The One-Night Lake", a pretty famous VNese legend 
More info here: 
Been sitting on this for a while, but I've sold my novella "The Citadel of Weeping Pearls" to Asimov's for their Oct/Nov 2015 issue
@ce_murphy *HUGS* I know exactly the feeling. Go get some rest (if you can!) and some chocolate
@garethlpowell at least copy edits don't throw their food on the floor :(
@garethlpowell :D :D
@KariSperring @charlesatan *waves* good evening Charles, good morning Kari!
@garethlpowell thank you! It's the childcare I'm going to need all the luck for, I reckon..
@charlesatan thank you!
But this is just to say that @cindypon @KateElliottSFF @rcloenenruiz are all awesome ^^
Going to be scarce on twitter in next few days: RL things beckon (aka childcare), and book things (aka copy edits)
@KateElliottSFF oooooh cool!


(Hint: exceedingly favorably)
@SheckyX ha. I'm half tempted to shift to the H's PC, which as a. the larger screen, and b. Windows...
@LAGilman @btw er, wow, thanks. I'm feeling like hiding now ^^
@LAGilman @zenaldehyde which makes this... difficult to handle
@LAGilman @zenaldehyde yeah, but I definitely could have used an extra week, though. It's the week where childcare failed me
@SheckyX I'm alternating between turning on and turning off revisions marks. Is it better in Windows, do you know?
@KatWithSword @zenaldehyde I'm going for tea
@LAGilman @zenaldehyde oh yeah. And five zillions things to check up in not enough time :( :(
@LAGilman @zenaldehyde ha. So it's not only me...
(also, track changes on Word for Mac really sucks. Trying to see whether there's a comma or nothing under a comment=mission impossible)
Copy edits. I am seriously tempted to take a leaf from @zenaldehyde's book of tricks and go for a glass of wine
@rcloenenruiz I specialise ^^

@marshotel :)
@marshotel if French="writing in French", maybe? If not, there's always my four nominations :p
@AidanRWalsh I honestly have no idea? It was a long time ago and I've never seen it, it looks like it's been out of print for a while
@marshotel it looks severely out of print... Only French nominee in novel category, looks like...
@AidanRWalsh @MaryRobinette wow. That must have been a lot of work--thanks a lot! Very enlightening.
Hey, a French novel was nominated for a Hugo! (Sylva by Jean Bruller, the founder of Editions de Minuits) 
Oooh congrats everyone, sounds exciting 
Morning crop: one fall, one set of pinched fingers. Ah, toddlerhood
(also, wow. This is clearly my depressing streak at work. Brainstorming with @rcloenenruiz resulted in some pretty creepy stuff)
Story done! Now can I get back to my copy edits please Muse?
@crashwong :D :D
@Keltounet yeah :(
I think I've just kicked my main character in the teeth. Repeatedly.
Hmm. I think I've sorted out this scene.
@EPBeaumont definitely! (my mom would prescribe ginger rice porridge, but soup sounds nice too. And plenty of rest!)
@matociquala emergency!
@EPBeaumont :( :( that sucks. Hope you feel better soon
.@JonathanStrahan interview KJ Parker! 
@AnnaFromA2 ha, not in the budget. Sleep it is, then...
@msagara ha. I feel less alone (still panicking, but less alone ^^) thanks!
@AnnaFromA2 he, thanks! I'm at the "sacrifice something" stage
@davidearle oh yeah. I should have put "parenthood", really
I think there's an unspoken rule of motherhood that you only have the childcare emergencies when something is urgently due

Int'l OKAY
Remembering Roger (Zelazny) 
@EPBeaumont @rcloenenruiz @jimworrad oh thanks, very useful!
*cleanses brain* WTF did I just read. *goes back to writing story*
I have nem nướng in the fridge, salad, coriander, &amp; mint. And nước mắm by the litre. Bring on the summer rolls!
I write in bursts because I have to, and because the story won't leave me alone until it's on the page
Sometimes I really feel that writing is like breathing--I write the stuff that has to come out lest it chokes me
.@RoseLemberg on Not Being Able to Speak Out &amp; Self Care 
@JonathanStrahan *jealous*
Hahaha some way to go before I make the typical income regularly ^^ 
@Krasnostein @maureenkspeller @D_Libris @JonathanStrahan @cstross yeah, same here.
@tadethompson @MorganJLocke @Cadigan adding my good wishes (and extra hammer and flamethrower as needed) Kick it dead!
@derGullen :(
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @_vajra yarrrg so much prejudice :( :(
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @_vajra though being too dark-skinned=being of Khmer descent, and that's also... not a good idea
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @_vajra being of part Chinese descent, and that doesn't make you friends
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @_vajra he, not sure I entirely agree? In the West maybe, but in South Vietnam being clear-skinned means
@JonathanStrahan @charlesatan arrg sympathies. I thought 20h was bad enough
@charlesatan :)
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @_vajra it's... unpleasant for me to be confused with a Chinese person because Vietnam was subsumed in China
@rcloenenruiz @jolantru @_vajra he. I get classified as Chinese (because Asia=China *sigh*)
Interesting read (agree the US-centrism of race relationships in SFF tends to erase other complexities) 
@jolantru @rcloenenruiz @_vajra yup, erases complexities of how we relate to each other, too (race relations among Asians for instance...)
@charlesatan ah. Then I'm better off writing ^^
@JonathanStrahan @charlesatan ugh.
Ok, so apparently Black Gate tried to withdraw, but the ballot is already frozen (thx @charlesatan) 
@charlesatan @JonathanStrahan urk. Sympathies. That would be a sucky one to book...
Er, ok. Black Gate withdraws from Hugo ballot 
@JonathanStrahan :( :( sympathies. Where are you trying to get?
@HaralambiMarkov please do!
@HaralambiMarkov %%%%%% so sorry to hear about this :( :( All the hugs. Let me know if you need support?
Up, awake and writing!
@shaunduke so do we! Have to get your priorities straight ^^
@sinboy and I really should try genmaicha
@sinboy we have about 20 boxes of various black teas, plus an extra 4-5 bags we got from Vietnam. Not happening here either  ^^
#1 is not happening in this house.  
Awwwww  
@tadethompson @fran_wilde oh yeah that one, too...
@beth_bernobich thank you!
@clarkesworld hahaha, as someone who has copy edits due at the end of the week I'm less enthusiastic... :)
@DamienAWalters ^^
@phiala @fran_wilde I wonder if mine isn't encrypted, but I think she's just a contrarian...
@dolohov @fran_wilde ha, that's great! I'm sticking to my moleskine notebook...
Introducing: the procrastinator muse! 
@fran_wilde LOL YES
...dust and ashes blown from the incessant battles in the streets; and summer followed winter with hardly a pause or a difference.  #wip 2/2
He had blue eyes; impossibly clear, the colour of summer skies in a season long gone--now the city lay under a pall of black clouds #wip 1/2
Also, procrastinator muse: ooh you have this due in 3 days, let me pelt you w/ great story ideas you must write now 
@beth_bernobich (and aw thank you!)
@beth_bernobich I'm mostly panicking at the scale of the modifications and the shortness of the deadline, to be honest!
@fran_wilde ^^ I do find stuff in the notebooks which was meant to be a helpful note and has turned unexpectedly cryptic
Oooooh CJ Cherryh gets a Career Achievement Award from the Romantic Time 
@fran_wilde LOL. I got a notebook against the goldfish muse!
@beth_bernobich ah. Makes sense! (is that the not!Sherlock book or something else?) I'm on copy edits so it's more procrastination
@JonathanLHoward hahaha pretty much. And throwing the hardest when something else is urgently due
@fran_wilde as reliable as clockwork I guess? Classic displacement...
@fran_wilde :( :(
@beth_bernobich hahaha yes. Professional procrastinator, I reckon :D :D
350 words on the short story I'm not meant to be working on. Thanks, Muse.
@fran_wilde urg. Sorry you had to go through that (though glad worries aren't serious!)
@saladinahmed @Xhakhal wow. So pretty.
@D_Libris @JonathanStrahan oh yeah I remember reading about this. Sad about all that sherry thrown away :(
@kellybarnhill cool. Thanks! Crossing fingers and not touching the thing for a while
@matociquala my experience has been "flail, angst, flail, and produce something anyway". Hope yours is the same
@matociquala ha. I don't know whether to be reassured or not that this feeling never goes away ^^
Reading @JustinaRobson's Glorious Angels and enjoying it a lot (OMG Tralane and her two teenagers are so much fun).
@kellybarnhill ha. It was a giant mug too :( Will see if I can find rice... (but it's reassuring to know, thx!)
@stephanieburgis he, thanks! It's drying in the bedroom and I'm trying not to fret...
@tithenai :) :) not for me either (have too many dresses anyway!) but coveting is nice
@tithenai ha, but these colours are the pretty ones!
Yeah, usually not one for clothes, but...  
@tithenai OMG *covets*
Right. I think I know where this short story is going. Except for the bit where I have copy edits first...
Missed @KateElliottSFF's review of @kyliu99's Grace of Kings 
@riajuunibyou fortunately no milk, no sugar, but still...
@riajuunibyou spilled about 400mL of tea straight across the keyboard... :( :(
Drying my laptop in the bedroom *sigh*
Belatedly catching up on this, but so much yes.  
@Eve_Shi @mikaela_l  @charlesatan thanks! Drying it out and praying, basically
Awesome! 
@JonCG ooooh these look pretty cool!
So, I just spilled a mug of tea over my macbook air. #nothappy
@ce_murphy @camilleregan sis and I loved it (the H was bemused. I had to explain the attraction of Loki plus Chris Hemsworth :) )
@tadethompson LOOOOOL Matrix makes everything better :) thx
@jolantru hugs. Will take forks!
Blearg #stillnospoons
@KateElliottSFF @rcloenenruiz @tadethompson and their behaviour, yup
@crashwong @charlesatan @kyliu99 awwwww that is so cool! I vote for Leia :p
@rcloenenruiz @KateElliottSFF @tadethompson I am not surprised %%%%%
@rcloenenruiz @KateElliottSFF @tadethompson wtf (and no one is obligated to listen to you)
@afishtrap 
@AidanRWalsh @MaryRobinette he. As I said--what you feel comfortable with (I certainly don't want to eat up your writing time!)
@AidanRWalsh @MaryRobinette (though of course it's debatable as I have dual nationality...)
@AidanRWalsh @MaryRobinette (I recall having a look at the Nebulas and I think I was one of 4-5 nominees outside US/UK, &amp; the only winner?)
@CherylMorgan @indiespiritbath ^^ happy birthday Cheryl!
@AidanRWalsh @MaryRobinette but I can understand it's a lot of work!
@AidanRWalsh @MaryRobinette definitely interested (your posts are fascinating but I admit to being curious about nominees vs winners!)
@afishtrap may I suggest waiting for August 20th? The book's worth is still being copy edited :)
@Evil0Dan hahaha thanks. I have no trouble believing that...
@clhollandwriter @alexthoth :)
@visyap pleasure!
@ce_murphy ^^
@ClaireRousseau it's on the ballot now, however :)
@MaryRobinette @AidanRWalsh definitely helps! It's mostly a matter of energy tbh (Jo Walton did it for average age of nominees...)
@CL_Hellisen ^^ it's warm here and I feel like doing summer rolls and salads and all the dishes of the South...
Zucchini, mango, green papaya... And a dash of dipping sauce (fish sauce/lemon/sugar/chillies) Yum
Today's random observation is that the kom kom shredder is the handiest tool I've seen for Asian style salads 
Code style guide via xkcd LOL 
@rcloenenruiz that would be my function too ^^
@jolantru ooooooh. That's lovely!
@jolantru HUGS
@jolantru he. Retail therapy FTW
@maureenkspeller :D
@GillianPolack :( :( hope the season ends soon
Erased last tweet--as many ppl pointed out to me, Marquez died last year. Sorry. Not awake. At all.
@SafaaDib yeah. So I've realised :(
@grahamsleight er yes. sorry
@maureenkspeller yarg. You're right :( thanks
Good morning everyone! Spoon levels still very very low. Am having tea and teaching useful words to snakelet (fish sauce, spring rolls ^^)
@Miyulinka :( :( that sucks
@BrianTMcClellan ha, I know the feeling. I can write fast, but it requires 10x the time to plan beforehand (hope you grab some sleep ^^)
.@tobiasbuckell on why conventions (and fandom) have never been a safe space for me 
Anyway. Off to bed. Night everyone!
One day I'll have spoons and do some stats... *sigh*
Said it before, but quite curious how many Hugo nominees were from outside US (and outside US/UK/West. Anglophone world).
@rosefox *nod* shades of familiar :(
Reminds me of the roundtable we're having with @charlesatan @zenaldehyde @halleluyang @likhain @bogiperson
Putting the world in Worldcon by @gilibugg 
@Evil0Dan not very. He just started toddling on his own ^^
.@tlmorganfield's story "The Hearts of Men" (Aztec six-guns, pretty darn cool) available as ebook 
Children really are zombies. They drool, eat your brains, and make *you* a zombie.
@Evil0Dan ha. Prepare yourself...
In in-tray: copy edits (aka hunkering down for next 10 days), story edits, and brainstorming. Yeah, right. Not happening tonight.
Spoons are a little better but not great (was this close to giving the snakelet a breakable glass). Time for otters and kittens!
@adribbleofink I haven't yet looked at the other ones! Just at the ones in your post. The Discworld ones are amazing
So pretty 
@adribbleofink wow. These are. Just wow.
@AquilaRift @Siegel_Jan @hierath77 @Gollancz clearly I need to set up shop :p
@matociquala @AquilaRift @Gollancz ha. I have a list of "spare names for minor characters from XX" I use, but I always end up needing more
@MangoHeroics @KateElliottSFF @tobiasbuckell @sasquansf ooooh will be there too!
@KameronHurley oh. Best of luck and hang in there
I just had a bit of a laugh imagining Grand Moff Tarkin in slippers--musn't have been easy for other actors either! 
W00t! 
*sigh* thank you, Muse. I didn't need to be derailed by sentences in the middle of planning a completely different short story
covering her clothes in a fine, white layer that slowly and irretrievably obscured the insignia of House Lazarus. #wip 3/3
--from time to time, the distant echo of a magical conflagration would shake the room, and dust would fall on her chest; ... #wip 2/3
She lay in state in the small, pathetic chapel they'd never had time to finish--her eyes turned towards the blank, unpainted ceiling #wip
OMG @motomaratai has a patreon!!! 
@stephanieburgis @juljames *hugs* toast is lovely--hope it's better soon!
Can I have one? :)  

I love this: 43 versions in English of a truly wonderful Li Bai poem. 
@CoraBuhlert @rcloenenruiz @EPBeaumont maybe sharing books would help? I know that's how I learnt English
@rcloenenruiz hahaha no :)
@MorganJLocke I've always wondered if I wasn't too old when I tried to read it, tbh
@kyliu99 :) pleasure!
@halleluyang @HaralambiMarkov @_vajra @shannonpv @DamienAWalters aw thank you!!
@MorganJLocke that does change things quite a bit... (I never managed to get very far into the book but it was years ago. Should try again)
Cut scene from A WRINKLE IN TIME and L'Engle's politics 
@garethlpowell ooooh pretty!
@likhain HUGS HUGS HUGS sending all good thoughts
New ghostwords post! "Rae smells like (...) blood beating and citrus freshness of blue-green veins" 
Awwww 
A belated happy release to @dianapfrancis, whose new Diamond City Magic book recently came out 
@CL_Hellisen @jolantru @KateElliottSFF thank you!
@KateElliottSFF :) Philippe is basically the firebrand of the cast
@KateElliottSFF Morningstar is pretty cool ^^ (my weak point is Asmodeus--not that I want to be in the same room, but he's great to write)
One last #ff @jolantru writes fantastic urban fantasy, family-centred, set in Singapore
@KateElliottSFF I'm very very glad those work. (also I'm basically all red-faced now :) )
*embarrassed now* 
@KateElliottSFF just found this... Aw thank you!
@juanluis_ga yup. The genre has changed a lot since Tolkien and Asimov's
@eruditeogre @JonathanStrahan @kyliu99 oh. That would be awesome. I read Foundation when I was 16 and my mind was blown...
@liam_dwyer @zenaldehyde aw thank you!
@CoraBuhlert @EPBeaumont @rcloenenruiz oh wow. That's scary creepy.
@booksmugglers @charlesatan @fangirlpodcast Three Body Problem on novel ballot, Steven Diamond on short story
Speaking of @msagara, a great post about how she doesn't write romance 
#ff @likhain whose art is like a punch to the solar plexus, and whose poetry has the elegance and poignancy of the masters
#ff @msagara because her Elantra books are just *so* cool
#ff @KateElliottSFF who writes book with awesome world building and characters you just love (also Spiritwalker trilogy! Dinosaur lawyers!)
@KateElliottSFF @D_Libris oooooh..... So cool.
Speaking of @kyliu99...  
#ff @visyap who writes elegant, heartbreaking fiction 
@juanluis_ga fair point! I reached for the first epic fantasy I could think of!
@charlesatan @crashwong @kyliu99 I want to see this!
#ff I'm not sure no one needs me to point to the fabulous @kyliu99, but here goes :) (and read his novel! 3 Kingdoms meets Tolkien)
#ff @rcloenenruiz who is awesome (and without whom there would be no House of Shattered Wings)
Changes to the Hugo ballot. OK. I'm a little happier now, "Three-Body Problem" is on it 
*nod*  
Why Christopher Eccleston left Doctor Who 
@NeutrinoJones I know. I am so afraid they'll f%%% it up. But. But.
@clhollandwriter @alexthoth and thanks!
@clhollandwriter @alexthoth UK one still being done, that's why! (I've seen stuff but am not allowed to talk ^^)
@NeutrinoJones I kind of want to see Episode VII. Now...
OMG just saw this via @booksmugglers. I just tore up a little.  
@BruinJC @adribbleofink thank you!
@irinarempt he. Fair enough. I was more thinking of people who thought they couldn't vote because their voices weren't important enough
Good morning everyone. Spoons moderately back (aka zombie state)
@mikaela_l do you still need a beta? I can read if not too long
@RealMadLogician @KateElliottSFF @jdiddyesquire @KameronHurley @ghostwritingcow same.
@KateElliottSFF @jdiddyesquire @KameronHurley @ghostwritingcow yeah. Buying a book about right now I reckon.
@markokloos what @KateElliottSFF. Thank you for this, and I'm sorry you were caught in this.
@alexthoth he, thanks! It's mainly because @clhollandwriter was around. I am not a very good titler of novels
OK I know I said no more Hugos but holy molly (last two RTs via @booksmugglers)
@iainjclark aw thank you so much! Much much appreciated. I hope you both like it!
@adribbleofink mine isn't a wild success, and I haven't counted this year, but last year I'd made 2000 euros on it I think?
@Herbefol :) inside coming right up, in a few months! Eep.
@thehambelt thank you!
@adribbleofink he. Sounds like it's off to a roaring start though!
@meijerjt wombats make everything better! Thank you!
@rcloenenruiz HUGS. Thank you. I really feel like curling up in bed and doing nothing all evening :(
@wa7trel *hugs* thank you!
@Pallekenl hahah. And rabbits! thank you!
@Pallekenl thank you!
Consider this the warning.
I think what this feed needs is a warning in the evenings, when it switches to otters, kittens and cute animals
@adribbleofink it's very encouraging (I've done it once, but it's great to see other people's experience)
Very informative description of self-pub vs trad. Interesting to see breakdown of costs and advantages &amp; drawbacks.  
@Herbefol hahaha fair point :)
@lizwithhat not at the moment, no :(
@dan_hanks thank you! The artist is @NekroXIII
LRT, I feel like I should be screaming "pre order my hardcover" :p :p 
Super informative  
@BrianTMcClellan oooh thx for this!
@charliejane @IreneGallo @wilhelmstaehle so. Pretty. And it sounds great!
@ADD_Gamer_ hahaha that too, but I meant mental spoons
Spoons. Low on. Again.
@Keffy ooh. Congrats!



You don't have to be a subscrib…
@booksmugglers it's a bit too soon I think? We've basically just put it together with @TiemenZwaan...
Anyway, no more Hugos reading for me. I have a crabs-in-space story to write.
@booksmugglers oooh. Oooh. Please do come! Would be very glad to see you.
@mikaela_l W00t draft!!
@ChuckWendig thanks for these. Now thoughtful.
@civilianreader @UKTor @silvanhistorian it looks very pretty
I love the covers, and I especially love the alternative designs and why Tor chose the ones they did 
Stunning.  
@likhain @RoseLemberg @KateElliottSFF @bogiperson @thelionmachine @EPBeaumont oooooh so pretty! Your art is always amazing.
@kyliu99 I hope so!
@LiangYalan yeah, same feeling
Yes. I've blogged about this before, but politics/worldview always makes it into fiction  
@meijerjt and @tadethompson @RosariumBill @rcloenenruiz @TiemenZwaan!
Awww. Cat cuddles other patients at Animal Shelter (via @KariSperring) 
Wonderful.  
Adding events to website: Nebulas (June), Worldcon (August), and Eschacon (November, Amsterdam!)
@chrysoula yes
Locus Awards voting ends tomorrow, please don't forget to vote 
htt…
@ehmaimon @MaryRobinette pleasure, I'm glad I was of help
@matociquala w00t!!
Last tweet: would definitely encourage people who've felt on the margins of the Hugos to apply--please don't self-eliminate
Reminder that @MaryRobinette is still giving away 75 Hugo voting memberships, no strings attached--put ur name in hat 
@LabyrinthRat yeah. I'm getting a strong feeling of stale. Far better to focus on our work
@LabyrinthRat I just find it so draining :(
@tithenai he, same feeling!
@qmulbioethics I am trying to. I need to disconnect and write
Reading way too much stuff on the Hugos *sigh*
@zenaldehyde ooooh
Ooooh very interesting mind meld on cities and fantasy (obviously I'm interested!) with @fran_wilde @CoraBuhlert  
Em and Pete are fantastic, and it's a very well deserved Hugo nom.  
@zenaldehyde @kyliu99 @SagaSFF oooh shiny!
OMG the cute 
@likhain I can tell you again and again if necessary :) all the hugs and hope you're ok
Last quote from 
"The more I read history, the more I realize that a lot of our ideas about the past and about historical cultures are wrong"
nod* @kyliu99
@didic @LMMyles @Paul_Cornell :( :( that's terrible.
@mahveshm :( :( it's unseasonably warm here but that's still not a lot of degrees
@LMMyles @Paul_Cornell (insofar as we're concerned, "left-wing" in France is like "Communists" in other European countries)
@LMMyles @Paul_Cornell ha yes, left wing in the US means a very different thing than left wing here
@charlesatan thank you!
@rcloenenruiz thank you!
Happy Wednesday everyone. We shall be dashing off and cleaning the house...
That's wonderful 
@rcloenenruiz ha. Yes, that sounds like it. I emailed you BTW?
@rcloenenruiz that's because he needs minions, and the younger the more malleable :)
@shaunduke @afishtrap @KateElliottSFF @ghostwritingcow @MaryRobinette @KameronHurley :)
@RomeoRites @shaunduke @KateElliottSFF @ghostwritingcow @MaryRobinette @KameronHurley aw thank you! Hope it's worth the wait
@arisiacrystal @KateElliottSFF definitely!!!
@MaryRobinette @KameronHurley thanks, Mary!
@rmacanthony @shaunduke @KateElliottSFF @MaryRobinette @KameronHurley thank you!
@afishtrap @KateElliottSFF @shaunduke @ghostwritingcow aw thank you. I'll take dim sum :p
@KariSperring @rcloenenruiz @marthawells1 @MaHelgad @AthenaHelivoy @Rachelphoenix @rachelswirsky aw thank you so much, Kari. Back at you
@wanderchopstick he. Yeah, that would have been great (plus I'm sure it'd have been easier to get good phở in LA than Spokane :) )
@KateElliottSFF *blushes* thank you!
@ms_marques ha. Yeah... :(
@jophan_c @cstross :(
@wanderchopstick yeah, it's just my luck the thing is is at the wrong end of the US :p
@KameronHurley thanks :) Glad I'm not the only one
Oooh 
@KameronHurley glad it arrived safely! (now I'll duck and hide...)
@BeritEllingsen thank you! It's thanks to a very supportive husband &amp; family, I have to say
@kyliu99 :)
Right. Time for a book and bed.
@Kalendaries ha. That's a good trick, thanks!
@LiangYalan thank you!
@Kalendaries no, it's a general "quote 1-2 areas you feel you're good at" :(
@BeritEllingsen :( hugs
@KateElliottSFF I've managed to book my tickets--going to Worldcon!!!
@LiangYalan they were, sadly, the only airline that was flying close to Spokane :( :(
Panelist forms. Aka "pimp yourself". I SUCK at this
@LiangYalan well, not so much, because I'm flying with them to Portland...
@KariSperring yeah. I was going to fly in via Seattle, but then by the time I got into gear I'm flying into Portland
@LiangYalan I feel stupidly proud ^^
@usmantm he. Will see you at the Nebs first though?
@RosariumBill I was close to the heaving ball stage, honestly. Especially when KLM crashed on me...
I mean, seriously. 1st Delta hiked the price of the flight I wanted by 100 euros, then KLM crashed on me, and I ended up booking Air France
OMG managed to book my plane tickets to Sasquan after 1 hour of arrrgggggg
LRT: awww
@civilianreader awww. Cat in chain mail always suffices! Thank you!
@meijerjt definitely otter, thank you!
@Eve_Shi *uses up whole bottle* thank you!
@KateElliottSFF I do need this. Yep. Thank you!
@bentylersmith hahaha thank you!
@stephanieburgis ooooooooooh
Have just seen a thing on the internet. I need brain bleach.
"In the forest, where the foliage was thickest, I met Salayan one last time." 
New Ghostwords post! 

Recommended.
@bentylersmith oh wow. Haven't read Redwall in a while
Hahaha yes. That.  
@sethjdickinson soul-mate!
(more on that tomorrow I reckon. #discworldreread)
#discworldReread hits Witches Abroad, btw (actual author doing the reading is at Small Gods, but haven't had time to comment on this one)
@stephanieburgis :) pleasure!
@Radlein :) that one made me laugh, thx!
@katherine_jay ha. Librarians saving the world is definitely a trope I can relate to! (I have a librarian in my novel but she's more sedate)
@rcloenenruiz OMG *dies of cute* thank you and hugs
A propos of nothing: if you want something light &amp; fluffy, @stephanieburgis's novella Courting Magic is delightful 
OK. Spoons low, once again. You're warned that this feed tonight might be otter pictures all the way
@ghostwritingcow definitely ^^
@ghostwritingcow LOL that is awesome!
@ashokkbanker @malindalo @cindypon @kyliu99 if they're named yes, but not as main characters...
@EdwardCox10 deal! :)
Oooooh House of Shattered Wings mentioned in interview with @EffingRainbow, thank you! 
@SCyFlynn @KameronHurley @sethjdickinson @longshotauthor @catvalente @EffingRainbow ooh thanks for the heads-up!
@sl_huang ha! In short stories I sometimes think there are more men than there should be...
@Pallekenl :)
@cstross ha. Definitely intrigued now (though they had me at "order of librarians save the world")
Ooooooooh that's an awesome offer, go forth and bid :) (I love Spiritwalker, but the Secret Journal adds a lot) 
@rosefox @kyliu99 @cindypon which is good. We need more female friendships and more female community--the lack of it in books is hurtful
@ashokkbanker @malindalo @cindypon @kyliu99 I counted one per character, and then I did it separately for mains and background roles
@rosefox @kyliu99 @cindypon I can imagine :( :(
@malindalo @cindypon @kyliu99 ha that's pretty cool (but so hard to balance the background)
@EdwardCox10 pretty darn cool if you ask me (next up the list is my own TARDIS :) )
@TieryasXu pleasure!
@kyliu99 pretty sure yeah, but also pretty sure I have no time ^^ @amberdine
@kyliu99 @cindypon yeah, it was really hard for me not to reach for "spear-carrier therefore male"...
@kyliu99 @amberdine :D :D definitely not enough time here
@dancinghorse I know I noticed it in @KameronHurley's God's War? Very eye opening to see how you're deluded by your expectations
And that's both in terms of main characters and background characters. 0_0
Having done a quick headcount... Apparently when I think the novel is balanced in terms of gender, it genuinely is. Wow
@kyliu99 ha that would be, though it'd have a lot of trouble with your novel :) (and mine)
@kyliu99 you count the number of male vs female characters in your novel 
A bit busy with snakelet but will try to run the gender thingy on my novel. Curious. I suspect I'll have far more men than I think
On perception of gender numbers vs actual numbers 
@EdwardCox10 I vote for teleportation. It's always handy!
W00t Martha! 
@marthawells1 oooooh congrats!!!
Have to get this one, sounds like fun. 

@NeutrinoJones thank you!
@NeutrinoJones hahaha that too. I was more thinking of the privileged in general ^^
@matociquala @camilleregan oh wow. Looks amazinh
"...you think warmth, and safety, and power, are due to you. That anyone who doesn't have them doesn't deserve them." 2/2 #shatteredwings
"When you've never been hungry, or naked; or never had to run for your life, ..." (1/2) #shatteredwings
Rereading the novel day. Was struck by this
@ExLibrisHolland glad to hear it. I hope to write a Xuya novel some day, but right now all I have are a couple novellas
I have great sympathy for the Hugo admin &amp; team this year :( :(
RE LRT congrats to Thomas Olde Heuvedlt and Kirk DouPonce
@LMAshton *hugs* thank you and hope you get yours back soon.
@wanderchopstick thanks! I have trouble getting to Seattle in one stop, surprisingly? (looks like not a popular destination from France...)
@ExLibrisHolland :) :) thank you!
@ms_marques overall, yes. But you'd be surprised at what kind of transfers I've been offered...
@D_Libris ha. I forgot then :)
@D_Libris oh btw enjoying your tea very much--forgot to tell you!
@D_Libris pff never happy, are you? :p
@WritersGreenHse and thanks!
@WritersGreenHse I'm more inclined to think the youngest member of this household has eaten them ^^
@D_Libris well, hum. There's a Vietnamese fairytale I want to draw from, and it has crabs
@charibdys @Keffy :) good to hear!
@Keffy so plus plus then, I take it :)
@zola_the_gorgon ^^
@jolantru *HUGS*
I'm not sure if it's a plus or a minus, but I also started work on a short story involving crabs. In space. (don't ask)
Spoons: fresh out. Didn't actually do much today but definitely out of the blighters

@joemts @theginfairy @dellakinsmith ^^
Help @hawkwing_lb write her reviews: 
Just demonstrated I'd forgotten Spanish conjugations. But only half of them so I guess it's OK :)
@cstross ah, OK. No vacation for me, sadly--the con counts as my vacation from childcare :)
@cstross thanks! Looking at that route right now and thinking it might be a good idea.
@hawkwing_lb :( :( *hugs* (and yay random stranger)
@cstross AMS-MSP-Spokane?
@cstross *nod* it would have been my entry point in the US. Hence the scepticism. Out of curiosity--do you know what route you're flying?
@sbisson I did look at it, but sadly in the summer it's not that much cheaper :(
@cstross I just can't believe in the 1h40 transfer in Salt Lake City. Just. No.
@cstross I'm trying, it's Delta giving me the options, mostly!
@CarolineYoachim it is, it's just that I would need a hotel for Tuesday (and a ride back...)
@mikaela_l I have, just that I'd also need a place to crash (I'm assuming most people would be driving on Wednesday, I'd be arriving Tues)
(sorry, let me rephrase that. Getting to it in an affordable manner *sigh*)
(Spokane has lots of lovely bits I'm sure. Getting to it, however, is... challenging).
%%% flights. I have a choice of: 2 transfers (Amsterdam/Portland), 1 ultra-short transfer in the US (1h40, not doable), and 1 6h-wait
... on each shape to tell you the number of sides (the circle has a "1" on it. We're still arguing about that one) (2/2)
Snakelet is learning shapes today. Because we're both engineers, we bought the box of shapes that goes up to octagons, and has numbers (1/2)
All you need to do is apply, and she'll randomly pick recipients. Thanks to nominees &amp; others who make this possible 
.@MaryRobinette has 75 supporting memberships to offer for this year's Worldcon (to allow you to vote in the Hugos) 
ICYMI (last time I swear!) my experience as an SFF reader "The Stories I Wanted to Read" 
@thekefkaofclubs :)
@bogo_lode it's from this one onwards that most books nail all the threads, as you say. Definitely on firmer structural grounds
@bogo_lode oh LOL yeah. That was wonderful too
@wyrddrgn I can certainly see why he became a regular
@D_Libris oh really? Will have to keep an eye out!
#discworldReread and for me this is *the* book where Ridcully comes into his own as a character (love that the High Priest is his brother!)
@thekefkaofclubs ha. I read Hogfather first, too, which probably affect how I saw RM
@D_Libris :D :D "bonsai"
#discworldReread first appearance of Reg Shoe, who'll become a regular in Jingo I think?
#discworldReread and of course there's the invasion of the trolleys; shopping mall and shopping mall queen, with undead antibodies
#discworldReread There's 2strands, both (in diff ways) about discovering new horizons. Bill Door as a living being, and Poons as a dead one
@riajuunibyou he, thanks! I have a distinct memory of working out it was phonetic and uttering the words aloud to make sense of them
@thekefkaofclubs hahaha for me that's Hogfather. But I can totally see why that one'd be a favourite
@schanoes the undead as defence mechanism is just *wonderful*
#discworldReread amazing what a difference ten extra years of reading in English make...
#discworldReread but still. I remember struggling to parse Mrs Cake's dialogue, now it just looks absurdly simple to me
#discworldReread It's, I think, less successful than subsequent Death books because it's missing Susan, who is his foil
#discworldReread Mysterious stranger arrives in isolated locale, the invasion of Ankh-Morpork by creepy trolleys, the commando wizards
@rcloenenruiz *hugs*
#discworldReread: Reaper Man. I've always had a great weakness for Reaper Man. It hits a lot of my buttons
.@jolantru on her personal experiences with SFF 

…
@MarkGerrits @pornokitsch we have a cellar. I'm not sure it's big enough for anyone to even lie down in it
.@strangehorizons reviews @silviamg's Signal to Noise 
Interview with @runpetewrite : 
@juanluis_ga it's perfectly clear to me, no worries ^^
@juanluis_ga aw thank you! Very inspired to have you as a reader!
@D_Libris I loved ‘Leaf and Branch and Grass and Vine’ (read it in the Very Best of @KateElliottSFF), clear highlight of collection
@samatlounge uh. Now curious to look at ebook adoption in France (we have a lot of laws protecting bookshops)
@irinarempt :)
@zenaldehyde @rcloenenruiz aw thank you!
@rcloenenruiz wow. I look a lot more confident than I felt :p
Been there too! 
Hahaha. I think I'm a contrarian :p 
@tomhpollock he. I found it intense because it's always the same POV? Nothing to distract you from it
@stephanieburgis oooh that sounds like great fun!
@rmltpie thank you!
Interesting data. Word of mouth is such a hard thing to create...  
@tomhpollock he. I haven't done it in a while, but I generally write a lot more snippets and character analysis when writing 1st person
Now wondering if I should fly in on Tuesday or Wednesday for Worldcon after convo with @KariSperring I am great at this decision making
Oh yeah Three Body Problem is just great. I don't often use mindblowing, but I think it totally deserves it 
(book coming out in June from @TitanBooks)
Read @FredaWarrington's Dark Arts of Blood, a great new entry in her vampire series--love the characters &amp; the relationships btw them
It's a great book! 
@likhain hugs please take care of yourself. You're a very important voice and self-care comes first
@mahveshm @ghostwritingcow but there's a sort of grey zone where it becomes a little harder to judge? Not sure
@mahveshm @ghostwritingcow I think there's a point where it's easy to separate (flismy plot, cardboard characters etc.)
@ghostwritingcow @mahveshm yeah, it's just so hard to know why you like stuff! (if this was rational we'd have gamed it a long time ago ^^)
@ghostwritingcow @mahveshm "this is no good because it's different", if that makes sense?
@ghostwritingcow @mahveshm definition of "good" is shaped by mainstream and that anything different tends to provoke an instinctive...
@ghostwritingcow @mahveshm I support stuff I like--I do give a little more leeway to diverse stuff because I'm aware that our
@sl_huang @charlesatan yes, this exactly.
@SuziSteffen :)
Oh and I think the entire internet has seen this, but ICYMI, me as a reader of SFF "The Stories I Wanted to Read" 
Sorting out my thoughts in the morning, pre caffeine. Ugh.
Flavorless and Colorless? Minority Experiences in MG/YA Books About Autism 
@SuziSteffen aw thank you! It means a lot to me and I'm glad you're enjoying it.
@JonCG it's sheer brilliance. I laughed *so* hard.
@SuziSteffen :) :)
Yeah. Just. No.  
@kyliu99 @KateElliottSFF thus stifling your own free speech? That's... something 0_0
