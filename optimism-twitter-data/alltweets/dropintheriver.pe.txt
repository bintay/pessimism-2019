ok the Thor comment was pretty good and made me giggle. a lot. 
what a coincidence C texted me and gave me a tiny ego boost 
he makes me feel like a sexual goddess yet they don't seem to work on the one person I want them to. he's like my own brand of kryptonite
I'm not use to having no effect on the male species C always talks about my magical temptress powers
but I don't want to deal with his face or cock. how bout you just eat my pussy we smoke a bowl and I go about my merry little way
days like today when I'm stressed or my ego needs a boost its oh so tempting to call A for the ego fluffing
I need him to fuck me like the naughty dirty little girl I really am leave me sore/bruised to remind me I belong only to him (and him to me)

what does it say about me when my own thoughts and deepest desires scare even me?
I need someone I be this open and vulnerable with.. it excites me oh so much 
I need a man to chase/woo me as much as I do him if I feel I'm the only one doing all the chasing I will move on. don't ever stop chasing me
I want someone to realise when I'm overthinking or we are fighting, I need you to grab me and shut me up/stop me in my tracks by kissing me
I need someone not afraid to call me on out my bullshit when I start to build a wall and pull/push away. self sabotage is my speciality
I want a verbal and physical sparring partner. I want someone to challenge me in every way. I want tickle fights that turn into so much more
ridiculous text or photo. make up a funny song or poem. make me laugh so hard I can't breath. the little things matter, more than you know
I'm a hopeless romantic and I both love and hate this about myself. I love cheesy romance. unexpected things. make me giggle. send me a

of intensity/passion with his own. make me yours. own me. leave a mark on my heart and soul not just my ass. all consuming heady passion.

the arse every time you text him. yet he is the one you cry over. can't stop thinking about and wish would pay attention to you.
the other doesn't seem to care anymore. never texts you. never calls. never asks how your day was. you sort of feel like an annoying pain in
one boy texts you every single day no matter if you were a cunt to him the day before. he's always there for you. yet you don't want him.
I was made to keep your body warm but I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms

take me into your loving arms kiss me under the light of a thousand stars place your head on my beating heart 
I need this to happen. soon. le sigh. 
repeatedly telling me how big your cock is and how good you can fuck me is an utter waste of your time I'm like Fort Knox not gonna happen.
when did going out to dinner suddenly equate to mandatory sex. i don't give a fuck how big your cock is, it's not going to change my mind.
I hate dating. I've decided I'm going to be a nun. it'll be so much easier.
how does one politely tell their former fuck buddy thanks but no thanks, really it's you not me, without sounding like a selfish cunt

today might be the day my overthinking finally breaks me.

letting yourself be happy with someone is the most terrifying thing in the universe. once youâ€™re happy it can be taken from you.
honey you hold the only key to entering the heart of me and setting all my demons free...please 
and i say, i'm sorry i'm so crazy i'm astounded by your patience and you say, believe it or not baby
the joy you bring me still outweighs it
I fell three times this weekend...two I recall very clearly..the third happened so slowly I'm not sure when it happened exactly.
