To fully enjoy the 'Colors' album by Between the Buried and Me, you have to listen to it from beginning to end
@hmweakley @SeanGregston thank you, thank you. We will be here all week!
@SeanGregston and then we just drop it on the ground and say, "Chip chop ol'chap, enjoy our shit!"
@SeanGregston and when you come in we will ride!
@SeanGregston okay in all honest, I am making shirts like that now

Check cashed, breakfast devoured. 4 more hours till the weekend!
Not gonna lie, the new Bring Me the Horizon song is pretty solid!
We got Mark Henry over here looking at us, the Hersey man himself
To everyone complaining about 8 degree weather. It was -8 or so when I left this morning. Sure was brisk!
I just saw two tweets that made me want to scream.  Perhaps a brief history lesson on how this is a country founded on religious freedom?
Something I Can Never Have is one of the most haunting songs ever recorder.  Damn you Trent Reznor
@LoLeSports Fnatic all the way! #IEMKatowice #Lolesports
You are trying to save me but perhaps I am not lost
Oh god, senior year me! #flashback #highschool #senior 
If you're not breathing, why am I?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls, dance to this beat
It sure is weird getting up in the evening and going to work early in the morning
I get off my shift at 1pm, go to sleep at 2, wake up at 7 thinking I missed my shift only to realize I only slept for 5 hours.  #kindofawin?
If you don't think Thirteenth Step is one of the best albums ever then you aren't even human

Probably the most creepy thing to see when you walk into the stockroom 
Having scrapping an inch of ice off my windshield I got to work. We are slow and I should've just stayed home. Damn you winter!

@ShadowOfSpaz ;) right? RIGHT?!
Violence, give me violence
Can we all just talk about how awesome Nine Inch Nails is?
@cwgabriel It's days like today when I love Penny Arcade the most.  Awesome ending then an amazing bonus comic.  Truly fantastic
I am the reason you are still breathing #volumes
Everyone should listen to Ragnarok by @PeripheryBand to ensure the world ends at midnight
In the darkest corner of my mind, I see a boy with a crooked smile
200 dollar custom frame for free because of a slight scuff. Finally some of my work has a frame! #perk of #w 
Also, just because I didn't tweet about it. HOLY SHIT HIMYM! Talk about all those feels!
League of legends! Why you no patch properly!?!?!
10 down, now just to let them dry and finish them up.  #ominous #christmasttweet
Every year people bitch about saying Happy Holidays. Guess what? There are other holidays at this time, not just Christmas
This is how we roll. Or I roll. I'm just lazy. #work #arts #crafts #iamsodamnlazyholyshit 
I just want to go roam the streets and play my violin, even though it would sound horrible, it would be fun
@SavannaahJane don't let assholes get ya down!
@SeanGregston @thunderkitty011 it is hilarious
@SeanGregston joins you in the dance, furthering our bromance and giving the inspiration for novel two
@SeanGregston get drunk and tell you the forward is okay and to leave in the dance reference
@SeanGregston fly to Colorado and burn the copies you have so far of the forward. Laugh and grab a beer for a job well done
@SeanGregston begs you to leave out the part where I did dance moves to a Muse song. Realize I just mentioned it
@SeanGregston notice this is turning into some weird harlequin romance novel but enjoy it all the same
@SeanGregston be okay with that and cherish our bromance. Smell back of shirt when no one is looking
@SeanGregston Realize that my life is about masturbation jokes and random outbursts and be fine with that
@SeanGregston Reuse the first masturbation joke, thinking I am clever, realize that I am not clever, reevaluate life via Twitter
@SeanGregston Respond with witty acknowledgement of your witty acknowledgement.  Also, another jerking it joke.
@SeanGregston Insert obligatory masturbation joke here.
@thunderkitty011 No, some massive douche.
I'm pretty sure I just read the most idiotic thing on Facebook from a leeching, low life, piece of shit.  And people still back his choices!
I wish people would learn what the term 'false advertising' actually means
Gangsta fresh with these purple walls 
@pvponline I will not lie, I have been wanting to do something like this for years but alas, you beat me to it.  Super excited for this!
Hey everyone! It's @ShadowOfSpaz birthday! Roll a d20 to see if you successfully tweet him a happy birthday!
#lordoftherings 
61 inches of blu ray awesome. #lordoftherings #thetwotowers #hobbitpreparation 
@PeripheryBand The Pantech C300s okay, but then she got an upgrade and threw it away!
Okay, drinking a pot of coffee while at work was not a good idea. I am super jacked up right now
Man, we are so busy. I see now why we stay open till 10. #smokebreak #work #whyarewestillopen 
@speaksnake okay that never happens but still!
@speaksnake there are reasons why I sweat in private. Don't want all the dudes gettin mad that I'm eye candy for their ladies
@speaksnake lolol, those damn gyms I tell ya!
@speaksnake and the most blunt tweet of the night goes to you!
Dear chocolate cake and coffee, help me deal with all these stupid people at work tonight 
@ToriShaye cheer up yo!
Working till who knows when. #money
@5Wolfe but hey man, you could tell people who painted different things. Informative!
@5Wolfe become an art major. Then realize there are little jobs in art.
And in this photo we see how my glasses are bent #themoreyouknow 
The guy that was taking pictures of our store earlier was either Stephen King or someone that looks a lot like him
@5Wolfe Ash is knocked into a coma and the only thing he says is that he is going to be the very best and catch them all
Slow day at work #art #work #boatsandhoes 
@5Wolfe holy...shit. this is on par with the Ash being in a coma story
Destroyer
I can't forget the taste of my own tongue
@speaksnake it just makes you giggly and not care. To get teeth removed only takes a couple seconds. Before you know it, its over
@speaksnake get that shit taken care of. You don't want to ruin your teeth. Just think of the laughing gas! It's fun!
dsilky89 is classy as all hell 
Bill Cosby sweater. Zip bop biddity jello! 
Windows, why you take so long to configure update!?
I am a man that loves his #chalupas 
@speaksnake join the club! We meet wherever our cars can take us
@XxMaTtMoOrExX cheer up broseph! Always a bright light at the end of the tunnel
@pvponline I think what you are saying justifiable. Then again, I stopped reading his comic after the miscarriage arc.
That awesome moment when you find a pack of smokes in what you thought was an empty carton.  Happy Thanksgiving to me!
@ShadowOfSpaz jackwagon!!!
@heyJoshuasup ...Imma do it anyways
@heyJoshuasup I'm going to do this every night for a month until you love me
I really hate when people get mad that we have people that live in this country that speak a different language as their primary language
I really would like to play WoW with @pvponline but I don't wanna be the creepy dude asking to play with him
I sold my soul to the open road
@cwgabriel #gabesearch2012
Is it weird that I knew one of the Christmas songs playing at work was boyz II men?
@speaksnake you're welcome!
So subway has these now! #snickerdoodle 
All is violent, all is bright
#etid at their finest 
@speaksnake That usually only happens in the Bible belt or in a Christian private school, but even then there is still some science
@AustinWolfe5 I'll give you a call tomorrow at some point and we will talk man.
@AustinWolfe5 What's going down broski?
@SeanGregston Now I want some Kroger Mac and Cheese!
@SeanGregston It's like, "Oh I can get gas AND a sandwich today!"
@riggle_me_that Dude!  Mind blowing eh?
@XxMaTtMoOrExX You could probably look up the specs on it to see what kind of watts and what not you need.
@XxMaTtMoOrExX Found out what kind you can use and look on ebay for them.  Get some vintage tubes man. They sound the best
Trapped inside this Octavarium
@speaksnake But it's what I do!
@speaksnake @ShadowOfSpaz @SeanGregston You guys always post the good stuff when I'm sleeping!
Today is one of those days where all my thoughts lead to you.  Miss you everyday Matt.  Love you brother.
@speaksnake Just tell them you need Sundays off for science!
@speaksnake Tell that to literally every Church going person I've worked with
@ToriShaye Anytime girl!  I'm always here to help!
@ToriShaye Remember that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel!  Everything gets better in time
My dream goal:  learn the violin solo for the song Fighting Tao
It's times like right now when I wish I could text @SeanGregston a certain question and I could hear him bust out laughing
@speaksnake then make a slap bet with them that you know you can win!
#Day7 no shave winter 
@GamerGuyJames yeah its a stretch for most of these people to even understand how our election system works
To everyone in WV: Obama is making things safer for coal miners. Educate yourselves for crying out loud
@SeanGregston And on the 7th day God said, "LET THERE BE ADBLOCK!" And so it was!  And we didn't have to deal with shit ass ads.  Amen!
Okay, I'm going to need to log off Facebook soon.  I am commenting on way too many political status' and I'm just getting angry
Vote for who think is the best for this country, not just the best for you.  Research, research, research.  Be educated about your choice.
@speaksnake @SeanGregston nothing says "fix your shit" more than packing your stuff and moving. I've done it.
#Day5 no shave winter 
@lartist But man!  Those craisins!  They are crying out for you!
“People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.”
@SeanGregston Oh you mean the one that is now my avatar?
@SeanGregston Awkward bro hug!
@SeanGregston We can be hetero life partners if we aren't married by 40!
@5Wolfe This is how I know we are brothers
Cold medicine and red bull. Take that runny nose!
@AustinWolfe5 Dude, what did you do now?
Damn you cold! I want an unclogged nose now!
@AustinWolfe5 This is your time to just mess with their evenings!
I know I think too much, about a world where I think too much
#Day3 no shave winter 
@VirtuousGuys You cannot compare the oppression of millions of people to abortion.  Gen 2:7 explains when you get soul and are "alive".
@SeanGregston Hey broski it's all good!  I haven't been to the gym in months!...-sobs while eating a tub of ice cream-
@thunderkitty011 Hurt song, lol.
1331
@AustinWolfe5 Bahahaha.  Tell that to your peach fuzz.  Don't worry, I'll bring our family name some honor with my epic beard!
@speaksnake that is some accurate butt aiming!
#Day1 no shave winter 
My service, to Lord Voldemort. #deatheater #Halloween 
@ShadowOfSpaz I learned it from you!
No shave winter. Day 0 #noshavewinter 
@hmweakley @wilw @ShadowOfSpaz Jim Darkmagic
22 dollar prismacolors, 5 bucks. 20 dollar sketch book, 10 bucks. Perks of working at a craft store 
Two Clintons! 
@ShadowOfSpaz board games eh?
Next year I wanna dress up as Protoman.  But the post apocalyptic Protomen version of him.
The worst things for me taste the best 
Final encounter of the campaign. #thereckoning #dnd #cobbles 
@5Wolfe If I know Mamaw she is going to realize she was a day early, haha.
@5Wolfe Was it Mamaw?
I wish I was in a video game band.  I can just imagine getting up on stage and rocking out to Mega Man songs
@SeanGregston You gotta buy me dinner first, man.  And us sharing our food when we lived together doesn't count in this situation.
If Hurt plays Got Jealous at their acoustic show, I think I will cry tears of happiness
@SeanGregston Say whaaaa
@pvponline So, who does a guy have to talk to about getting a 'Bin it to win it!' shirt made?
@thunderkitty011 I haven't seen myself without facial hair in a looong time.  It's...different
@thunderkitty011 lol why?
Feeling fresh #clean #shave 
@cwgabriel Today's comic gave me chills!  I can't wait to play Thornwatch!
I can't wait till I finish painting my Death Eater mask.  It will be my best Halloween costume yet!
I am a scribblenaut! 
Jet propulsion disengage
@speaksnake Your cat is too damn high!
I've been drinking green tea all day! #green #tea #dabest 
@heyJoshuasup &lt;3 you!
@thunderkitty011 I am lol
My co worker is ignorant as to how politics or the world works
@speaksnake you should always have one handy!
Nom nom nom #dinosaur #paint #nom 
@speaksnake pros/cons lists also do wonders!
@speaksnake you'll pick the right thing! Make decisions that are good for you and you alone
Even though I have a vast collection of music at my fingertips with Spotify, I still have to have physical copies.  Call me old fashioned
Beheaded #old #kindofartsy #ilikehastags 
@thunderkitty011 It'll be funny!
@5Wolfe Oh wait you still are?  Listen man, you are with friends.  It's cool bro.
I am Tom Sellecks mustache. Also I think I lack a proper jaw line. #self  
I'm going to count all the weird looks I get tonight at work because of my mustache.  Or maybe count the high fives cause this thing is rad!
Sooooo...who wants to start up a quidditch team? 
JK Rowling released a new book last month and I somehow didn't know?!  Must read!
@phillybo I have no reason as to why you should tweet me

@GamerGuyJames It does but that is life.  You have hurdles and you get over them.  You just have to remember to stay positive.
To everyone that is sad on Twitter right: cheer up!  The world is a big and beautiful place!  Look for the good in life!
Yet people show no respect for Obama as our president.  People should be thankful they have the right to bash the leader of our country.
As much as I disliked Bush as a president, I respected him AS the president of our country.
@ToriShaye Anytime!
I think I may start making pixel art magnets, coasters, etc. with perler beads soon!
@ToriShaye cheer up duders! Everything always has a bright side!
@krossboy27 so jelly man! I've been wanting to play it
@hmweakley I know that feel. Work all evening for me
Awkward face on a #rainy day #self 
There is something about rainy days that just makes me want to game all day long
@dredg The obvious choice is someone awesome...wink wink, nudge nudge
I am hungry.  Yet there is hardly anything at the house to eat.  I want pancakes.
I love that I always make memorable characters when I play tabletop RPGs.  Cobbles, Pete Jones, etc.
I want a chicken alfredo pasta bowl and those chocolate things from Dominos soon.
@heyJoshuasup I wish it was some deep web shit, lol
@GamerGuyJames unsafe browsing habits are the things that need to be fixed
@heyJoshuasup nah, like bogus sites that tell you if someones commited a crime. Real stupid shit
I honestly wish I didn't always have to share a computer with people that have unsafe web habits.
I have had three bowls of chili today.  I regret nothing.
@DSilky89 @ShadowOfSpaz yipyipyipyipyiypiypyipyipyipyipyipyipyiyip
@DSilky89 @ShadowOfSpaz Com...pu...TOR...compuTOR!
Seriously.  To have all the campaign materials at hand, at anytime I need them and being able to alter them is amazing.
I swear, Google Drive is without a doubt one of the best free cloud services ever
And my brakes are leaking again. I need a car on the cheap because this is ridiculous
My manager said last night that him and I should open up a craft store.  Even if he was joking or not, it sounded like a rad idea.
He got Tugboat back! #himym
@seangregston miss you duders! If I can get a second job, a portion of it is to go there!
@SeanGregston My fucking mind!
@SeanGregston Or be detained.  For once, a glimpse at freedom would feel divine
Travel these wonders far beyond
@Deniseyy_ Thanks!  My beard is pretty awesome.  You probably miss me bunches
@hmweakley @ShadowOfSpaz Is he anything but a Victorian gentleman?
Booo, I can't receive a Scroll of Resurrection, because I've already gotten one.  Perhaps this is a sign
@speaksnake If the scroll still does realm and faction transfers, I'll transfer over tonight as well.
@speaksnake sent in a DM
@speaksnake Do iiiiit.  I cannot resist the urges to play.  I should have the expansion and game time by Friday which means, PANDAS!
Well my WoW is patching.  Just in case I get a scroll of resurrection or something.  Even if I just play for two months.
@keepyourbones No the badass is to the left, not the right.  It's always to the left!
Okay seriously, how did I not know of Band of Horses before tonight?
And to make matters worse, I'm watching people stream MoP and I really wanna patch WoW and play!
@speaksnake I dunno if I'm more curious as to what she looks like or what guitar she plays, lol.
How I Met Your Mother, Y U NO show the mothers face yet?!
@SeanGregston The general populace has no idea how foolish they are half the time
@SeanGregston Because they look three months younger man
@jadesux @SavannaahJane When in doubt, a wizard did it.
@ShadowOfSpaz All of the above!
On Sunday god rested. Everyone else went to ac moore #shortstaffed
Perks of being a gnome? Attacking a dragon from the inside #dnd
GUYS!  I actually have two days off this week!  HUZZAH!

E sports &gt; physical sports
@5Wolfe car used go broke bitch. It's super effective!
@5Wolfe congrats broseph!
Coffee, white chocolate covered pretzels and Pelican.  Good times
@5Wolfe Just don't buy a poopster car like mine!
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Perks of working at an arts and crafts store. Free stuff! 
@courtsilvestri I love Betty White sooo much
I have a strange love for old TV sitcoms. Nothing is better than The Golden Girls and Cheers
Nothing beats getting out of the shower, hearing the HIMYM theme song then rushing to get dressed so you can watch it
Seriously.  This new The Chariot album is so heavy yet the lyrics and album as a whole are so finely crafted.  It's unreal.
Forget not your first love.  Speak in tongues and cheek.
@ShadowOfSpaz stop counting days and start living for him
@ShadowOfSpaz Riot Point.  Won them from a stream.  Good times
Okay, seriously.  I love my luck.  I just got free RP from watching a Twitch stream.  HOLY SHIT!
@HarleyPlays ...Sorry about that
The Mars Volta is a band that always amazes me
@ShadowOfSpaz This is an intervention.  You have an addiction
Easy like Sunday morning 
Drinking coffee at 4 am.  I think I have an addiction.
@SeanGregston Hungry for BRAAAAAAAAAAAIIIINSSSSS?
I was starving till I found packs of Ramen in the cupboard.  I will feast like a king!
@GamerGuyJames Looool.  Drake is actually an extremely talented artist.  I love me some rum though, it is good stuff.
@GamerGuyJames Disregarding that they are Drake lyrics, haha.  Kraken Rum.  Best stuff on the planet, hands down.
Take a shot for me, take a shot for me
@PeripheryBand &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Whammy!
@5Wolfe Welcome to college!
Part of me wants to sleep, the other part wants to stay up and keeping listening to Dream Theater
The Ghost Inside is band that just keeps growing on me
My whole house smells like pumpkin spice.  /winning
Work getting a new coffee machine has put me back into a coffee kick.  Which is good because I don't want soda so much anymore.  Just coffee
Wind Waker! 
@SarraSaturday But...but she killed Sirius!
Gonna crank up the tunes, do some cleaning then post a Link drawing I did the other day.  Productive time a gogo!
I had a dream last night that I started playing WoW again.  It was horrifying.
@SarraSaturday I am jealous!  Get a Snape wand!  Do eeeet!
@courtsilvestri @SeanGregston Correction: Wizard beards bring all the girls to the yard
I love lighting cigarettes with matches.  It makes me feel just a tad classy, somehow.
Uneven Structure &lt;3
@SeanGregston Did you save the beard shavings so that you can glue it all back on?!  Ladies love a bearded man.  #Truefacts
Just found the Pokemon trading subreddit.  They see me tradin', they hatin'!
Best feeling in the world.  Walking inside a nice warm house from being out in the chilly weather and touching your still cold arm.
I think I may go sit on my porch and draw my favorite Link
Past, forgetting, present, remembrance, future
@SeanGregston It's just because you don't get to see this face everyday.  If you did, you'd want to stay FOREVER and EVER
@SPENCIPHERY prepare to fall in love my good man!
Explosions in the Sky, I love you so much
@Austinwolfe5 and I make the best cookies #bros4lyfe 
@SeanGregston Your booty is rockin' everywhere?  There are things I never wanted to know about you Greg
@SeanGregston Just starting singing this: "Booty booty booty booty rockin' everywhere!"
Watercolor for my dad! 
@SeanGregston Everyone says that when they look at me!
@courtsilvestri hell yes!!!!
@courtsilvestri sprinkle cupcakes!
@SeanGregston @courtsilvestri but I did the baking! And I made delicious...sandwiches
@courtsilvestri but...but, I cook!
Why hasn't home style mac and cheese always existed?  This stuff is orgasmic!
@heyJoshuasup Best rum ever.  I've converted many of Captain Morgan fans to it.
@gamerguyjames money don't grow on trees
@gamerguyjames no sleep till Brooklyn

@AustinWolfe5 Reasons why my younger brother is creepy for 500!
Froggin' bullfish!
Whatever you do in life, make sure it makes you the happiest you can be
@PeripheryBand Thank for writing Mile Zero.  It brings back good memories of a friend I lost.  It is the song I connect to most this album.
@speaksnake they could smell the alcohol from a mile away
@GamerGuyJames gimme!
Someone please bring a pizza to me in Fairmont
He's a saucerrer
Brb from life for a few hours.  New Cloudkicker time

I expected Ice-T's face to be on it somewhere RT @Alexchapel: Why does this exist..... Only in Canada.
@Deniseyy_ Glorious life of  the closer
@SilentNinja31 I SAID AWKWARD HUG AND YOU WILL LIKE IT!
@SilentNinja31 Oh man for you!  It's gonna be so awkward that even the people in a 5 mile radius will feel it.
And if anyone knows what that last tweet is from gets a free awkward nerd hug from me

What's the difference between Clarksburg and yogurt? Yogurt has an active culture
Not eating a chicken sandwich won't help gays get married.  Voting in the right politicians will.  Vote more, bitch less.
The Whaler has to be the single most beautiful piece of music ever created.  And now I will never be able to hear it live. #Thrice
@heyJoshuasup I recommend some solid hardcore bands for that playlist.  Terror and Throwdown mostly.
@heyJoshuasup Every NIN song is perfect for working out.  NIN is perfect for everything.  Trent Reznor is a god damn genius
I'm pretty sure Drake is appropriate in all occasions
Eden is just another dry county
@dsilky89 you know it booooy!
@dsilky89 we are going to be broadcasting from a hot tub full of scotch
@dsilky89 you're gonna cream

Sketch of zee day 
Oh, it's jean creamin' time!
So this happened today #haircut 
@sohmer At the age where he actively reaches for the boobs with a grin
@ShadowOfSpaz This is pretty positive.  It is just a boycott.  Like the people that said they were boycotting Oreo for it's support of gays
Bill Cosby is my spirit animal
@ShadowOfSpaz But it shouldn't be an attack on Chick Fil A.  Not everyone that works their wants the traditional family.  Just some.
@ShadowOfSpaz To me it shows the American people that everyone has the right to get married and that people want that, no matter what.
@ShadowOfSpaz No it's standing up to someone who is against gay rights.  They lead a company that they can easily influence to do the same
@keepyourbones Prismacolors will run you a bit more, but I always enjoy the hell out of them
@keepyourbones prismacolors and artwin (something like that) are both really good
@cwgabriel If I let you be my dad, will you make me a super rad Pokemon deck?  I'm potty trained!
@courtsilvestri @shadowofspaz CEO and mascot!
@courtsilvestri @ShadowOfSpaz Man satchels for everyone!  Shae and I will now start an exclusive club for people with man satchels
#Thrice always has a way of just connecting to me and my emotions
Also that last tweet should have went to @courtsilvestri
(Hank Hill voice) I sell fabric and fabric accessories
@courtsilvestri I always thought of a narhwal as part unicorn anyways but it can be done!
@courtsilvestri I work at an arts and crafts store which means discount, which means you give me money, I gets you fabric cheaper
@courtsilvestri I will wear it EVERY DAY!  And in return I will do some sweet ass creepy watercolor!
@courtsilvestri Make me a man satchel!
The previous tweet was not me, but a friend but also strangely accurate
I wear a bikini under my work clothes.
Perks of working at an arts and crafts store: being able to take damaged canvas home!
Nothing beats #Drake in the early AM
Who invited the Russian soldier?
I really want to watch Lord of the Rings right now.  Either Two Towers or Return of the King, but I only have Fellowship.  /endlife
@courtsilvestri IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY AWESOME!  CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZY AWESOME!
You will hear my voice above the rest.  You will watch me shine
Art art art 
@notch I know this has probably already been brought up but stained glass by using dyes would be rad for MC
Today I got a sunburn, an #ETID I Party tank top, and the memories of seeing some of my favorite bands play live.  Another great Warped!
@adultswim I immediately regret this decision
@SeanGregston @SilentNinja31 Now I question how many people you know that work the streets
@SeanGregston @SilentNinja31 Why am I always the prostitute?!
No matter how many times I rewatch How I Met Your Mother, it gets better every time!
@SeanGregston @SilentNinja31 only I keep the money
Okay @Protomen covering Queen is probably the next best thing to Queen actually playing the songs with Freddie Mercury #lifeiscomplete
@SilentNinja31 yeah she forgot to
@SeanGregston true facts
@SilentNinja31 Awww yeaaah!
Full belly and now hopefully some art and some good tunes. Give me a conversation while I do so!
@SeanGregston Greg smash!
I do believe it is time to start growing my beard again.  I miss it so much! #beardlove
AC why you still make me sweat?!
@keepyourbones "Drama starts and people act like 12 year olds."  'Not a single fuck was given that day'
@keepyourbones ...that can be arranged super easily
@keepyourbones I'd just say it anyways.  Because they are 12 and easy to take down if shit goes down.
I dunno if I want to watch How I Met Your Mother or go through some of my Magic cards looking for one card
A kroger run may be in order
I really want apple juice right now for some reason. Or a good orange juice
People keep talkin'!  Talkin' 'bout people!
I decided to get chicken 
@krossboy27 chicken does sound good
Or maybe chicken. Decisions, decisions
Chicken sounds good
Hmmm do I want chicken or chicken today?
No matter how many times I listen to the Colony album, it always amazes me
Mega Man! 
Feeling creative.  Give me ideas on what to draw people of twitter!
@Deniseyy_ Time to color outside the lines!
@Deniseyy_ Say whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, well looks like it's Veggie Tales for you!
@Deniseyy_ Dude! Get Angry Birds!  'Cause they are angry!...or something birdy
I have the urge to play Super Mario Brothers on the Wii but alas, no Wii
@keepyourbones The ribs at Chili's are a bit small but really good.  They also have super burgers
@keepyourbones Chili's is always worth it.  The ribs are amazing!
Did someone say America? Fuck yeah! 
We are the strength of the universe at heart
A sign of things to come 
@SeanGregston GREG!  NEW PERIPHERY OUT TODAY GET IT!
@SeanGregston I'm pretty sure it was our manly farts that kept the poopster going in times of no money for gas
Awake the song within you #Periphery #MakeTotalDestroy
@hkitt21 you tweet more than a bird #badjokeisbad
@hkitt21 how about yourself yo?
@hkitt21 chillin like a baws
The Colony makes me want to build crazy stuff out of basic materials
@hkitt21 yoooooooooo
@krossboy27 It stopped being funny about 2-3 seasons ago
Probably the best clearance item I've seen at work so far! 
The Subliminal Verses has to be one of the most perfect records ever crafted
@speaksnake grab a bunch of ice and sleep on it! Science!
Creepy time with Jake and Finn! 
@5Wolfe dude!!!!! Pokemon snap &gt;&gt;&gt;
Gooby pls
Band practice is serious 
#Disappointingbands @PeripheryBand is not one of them!  Never in a million years!
Happy birthday to the greatest woman that ever lived, my grandmother Alice.  I think about you and miss you every day
@SeanGregston true fax bro
I know I want to do music for a living when I get excited about different features in Cubase
@SeanGregston That is pretty much a fact.  The hardest part is trying to avoid getting dragged into it
It's like my family thrives on drama sometimes
83 tweets till 1k!  Tweettweettweettweettweet
That awesome moment when @DSilky89 and I are excited about the blue rope lights in the band room.
@ShadowOfSpaz even though the show takes place in Canada sometimes.  Which is, of course, AMERICUHs top hat
@ShadowOfSpaz listen, those guys are driving under some dangerous conditions and you just gotta root for them.  Plus truckers = AMERICUH
Reese's Pieces &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I still have no idea why Ice Road Truckers is so entertaining to me
@ShadowOfSpaz You are truly Ted Mosby
It is most definitely a Hurt kind of day
@SeanGregston Wooo!  And if she starts creeping back again, just, you know, use a more severe STD
@SeanGregston And knowing you, you probably actually told the person that.  Now to wait on the response back
@SeanGregston Tell them you have herpes.  If it doesn't cause them to leave you alone, you will at least get a hearty chuckle out of it
Everything about the new @themegas is perfect.  And that album artwork, I want it as my Mega Man tattoo
First day at my new job!  Pretty pumped!
Hopefully I get up early enough tomorrow to get my phone turned on before I head out for my first day at work at muh new job!
The new @pelicansong EP is utter beauty
I want to get my Dark Mark or Pokemon tattoo soon.  SOON!
@SeanGregston Get a nice casual suit vest.  Wear that with the right shirt, pants, and shoes and you'll be the best dressed dude around!
#Scarlet makes me want @PeripheryBand new album even more!  JUST TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE IT TO ME NOW!
If people would use logic, I wouldn't be so tempted to delete them from Facebook
Watercolor! 
You wanna know how you train for a cross country race?  You have a black guy chase you with a knife #shitkeithsays
@GamerGuyJames hitting on people via Facebook through comments makes me lololol
One of my favorite activities: cock blocking random dudes when they try to hit on people on Facebook
@HarleyPlays You look like a bearded Slenderman.  Creepy as all hell man!
The most beautiful headstone for the most beautiful woman. She deserved this and finally got it 
It feels like, it feels like I'm on fire! #tha
I have a feeling that I won't want to stay at my house tonight
Being in Ohio at 1230 with friends feels right
@HURTofficial was amazing again. Victor talked to us and the show was phenomenal
Hurt for the second time in a week? Hell yes!
Who just won free tickets to see Hurt tomorrow? This guy!
Remember kids, no matter how hard you work, you still get fired
@shadowofspaz I'll send you a link to what I have so far
@ShadowOfSpaz I have a wealth of campaign information for you now.  I am proud I must say of what I have come up with so far
@Deniseyy_ You best do enough prep for us peasants on night shift!
@SeanGregston @ShadowOfSpaz Greg when you come in, we need to all grow beards
@ShadowOfSpaz DOVE, DOVE, DOVE!
Early evening creativity 
@SeanGregston You know if I ever came out it would be in the most flamboyant way possible
Explore, be curious
@HURTofficial was amazing last night.  Never before have I seen such an emotional performance.  Such an inspiration
@HURTofficial today at the Altar Bar!
@HURTofficial tomorrow in Pittsburgh!  Let's do this!
Hearing the ice cream truck music then running outside and getting a Choco Taco &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Imma enjoy this sunburn.  First sunburn of the summer!
@jennbassel thanks!
@jennbassel You guys are addicted to iced coffees.  Addicted I say!
@Deniseyy_ no rest for the wicked I say!
@Deniseyy_ I didn't yo. Twitter may have goofed and said I did
The things I get to do when I close 
I could eat provolone cheese all day.  Just the cheese, by itself.  I am addicted to cheese.  #cheeseintervention
Do it now! RT I think @GeekandSundry needs to team up with Penny Arcade and Scott Kurtz to record new Acquisitions Incorporated adventures.
I kind of want to stay up all night so that I go to the flea market early in the morning.  Who's in?!
Let yourself be huge #cloudkicker
I need to hurry up and fly through the 7th season of HIMYM so that I can see the season finale!  Even though this season is amazing!
@SeanGregston I will probably have it by Friday.  Then my life goes away
@SeanGregston In a way, I am glad I am waiting to buy D3.  At the same time, I want to play it now
I had a dream where @SeanGregston had long hair again and he surprised everyone with a visit here.  Miss you broseph!
I am biting my teeth over a live Magic the Gathering match.  I regret nothing.  #nerdalldayeveryday
I'm really curious as to why there is 3 people working this early
Hmmm Sheetz has what I would normally get a Starbucks and probably for cheaper.  Time to try something new!
@Deniseyy_ But it's Subway!  And an angry manager!  And MJ with Starbucks (for myself of course)
Starbucks opens at 6 eh?  Hipster morning activated!
or* #correctiontweet
Here's to hoping that the washer was fixed and won't leak again for I am le fucked.
@GamerGuyJames I haven't seen a really a good mono black deck since the beginning on Innistrad.  Now it is usually U/B control.
@GamerGuyJames It is looking like R/W Humans is big right now.  Some U/G decks seem to be doing well too
I've been watching the live Magic Pro Tour stream for most of the day.  I regret nothing
@shadowofspaz dude, it is Cobbles. You know I'm cool with it
@shadowofspaz hurry up with that campaign! I have an awesome character idea!
Good luck champ.  Go break your fucking leg #dividedby
@shadowofspaz Aren't they just fantastic?
This 'real talk' thing is getting old as fast as yolo
Mockingjay was probably the most hastily written of the three but I still enjoyed it and the series a lot!
@mmorgan_carterr Next time you'll listen to me!
"You know what you can direct? Deez nuts"
I hate having one work day in the middle of two days off.  It makes me the laziest fuck ever
#ilookforward to one day having a house with my own personal library.  Comfy leather chairs and books lining the walls
To me nothing beats getting lost in a book.  It is the perfect escape and the most relaxing and exciting thing in the world
@Gregamondo dude. Read The Hunger Games. Do it! Do it!
I took one step outside for a smoke, breathed in the fresh air and smiled. Summer is here
@dredg I want that painting more than I want Nutella!
And this is why I love @WhitechapelBand .  The new song is heavy as all hell but isn't a carbon copy of old records.  Love it!
I'm only an hour and a half into my shift and I feel light headed and fatigued. This is going to be a long night
I need a record player right now!  This Every Time I Die vinyl is itching to be played!
@SeanGregston Dude you should have seen it before I shaved the sides.  Looked just like Nick, lol.
Beard gone. Commence mustache! 
I'm pretty sure that is the fastest I have ever read a book.  I am now ready for Catching Fire!
I know I am behind on the times, but I cannot put down The Hunger Games.  This is one good book!
@Deniseyy_ You're technically supposed to have one if you work with food.  Our lovely manager lost mine though and wants me to get a new one
When I get asked today if I got my food handlers card, I'm going to say no. #watchout #wegotabadassoverhere
There's a song in your lung and a dream in your eye
I find it surprising that I still like sandwiches since I work at a place where I have to make them all day for people #subwayismysecondhome
When we think we've reached the end, we're only back where we began #ETID
I need the complete Hurt discography.  Thanks to my band mates I am addicted to them!
Legend of Korra is so good!  #imtotallyanearthbender
@SeanGregston dude you know nothing tops that epic Mexican food!
Polish sausage for dinner = win!
@Deniseyy_ I'm just that rad. But you did get to work with Chris and he is rad!
Finished ahoy! 
Something something artsy something something 
Fair to Midland...where have you been all my life?!
Fuck.  I think I'm a hipster
Also.  I want a pair of Toms for whenever I'm feeling classy and casual
Starbucks tarts = heaven
@ShadowOfSpaz @courtsilvestri A wild redhead appears!  She used architecture!  It's super effective!  Shae fainted!
Starbucks run later today? Starbucks run later today
Time to drive home and blare #structures
@Deniseyy_ psssh, bring it yo!
@Deniseyy_ here is your tweet I say!
Having to wait for your manager to come back and get your check is radical
I would like to thank @ShadowOfSpaz and @DSilky89 for having me addicted to @HURTofficial .  That was a lot of @'s
@DSilky89 you need to send me that Hurt playlist!
So hey microwavable pizza.  Next time, don't melt all over the microwave.
I'm raging a war against the silence before the storm
Everybody!  Add me on Pottermore!  'Cause I'm a sly Slytherin! MidnightFloo23180
@jennbassel Pottermore name!  Now!
@jennbassel pssst.  Slytherin house right here, just saying!
I need to move out.  Like now.  I honestly do not want to be in this house anymore
So Pottermore...it is going to take over my life #srslyijustgotawand #fuckyeah
@5Wolfe dude we are like twinsies! My one day off this week is also Tuesday!
Time to do some late night rearranging of the basement! #likeabaws
@thunderkitty011 This is what happens when I give you time to catch up!
@seangregston @speaksnake what the hell is a Hufflepuff?
@speaksnake totally jelly!
@speaksnake but I want to be sorted!
Okay listen Pottermore.  It is early April.  I'm tired of checking the site and getting the same 'In Beta' message.
I hate when I am hungry yet I don't want to move to make something
Oh, Interpol, how I love you
4 sugar, 3 half and half = perfect cup of coffee
Another 6 day work week coming up. Let's do this!
Well that was a fantastic movie!  Another favorite movie to add to the list
Time to finally watch 500 Days of Summer.  Wooo!
So Gotham City Imposters is crazy fun!
Classy as all hell 
I need to get @5Wolfe a graduation gift.  Maybe a hobo and a dick in a box
Women who love men who love drugs
The one time I need a blank CD and I have none.  Looks like a trip to Wal-Mart is in my future!
@SeanGregston Basically they were saying you dress better than them/have class!
Lunch shift at a subway I've never worked at before? This should be fun!
Fiction splattered fact
@shadowofspaz caaan do! I get to see if lunch is terrifying there
@shadowofspaz dude I get to work at your subway tomorrow
Lololololololol
LOUD NOISES
@ShadowOfSpaz love you broski. You know I give you a hard time cause I love you
Beer pong losers #2012
It's going well man. Taking a beer pong/smoke break. #wewillhavetoplaysomewherethere
@5Wolfe partying tonight I see too broski!
Hmmm... RT  @tommy4s: $10,686,924.83 won on MegaMillions!! not the $600 mil, but it works! retweet me and ill throw you $1,000, not joking.
@Dsilky89 wink
@Dsilky89 wink
@Dsilky89 #writeitdown
@GamerGuyJames Yup.  They start their farewell tour next month
Thrice is playing a show in Philly on my birthday on their farewell tour.  I must go!
Hmmm #14?
@thunderkitty011 you are a god damn god of archery and sneak!
@SeanGregston it is just so fun!
Watching @thunderkitty011 play skyrim is making me want to play more skyrim
I have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany
But it is weird because I was playing Skyrim before bed and not Zelda
So I had a dream that I had the Master Sword and I was absorbing powers from other swords with it.  Gimme!
Play me on Draw Something!  AwesomeCobbles is zee name!
@5Wolfe why you no follow me?  We are brothers man!  BROTHERS! #srslybro
Happy birthday to the greatest man I ever knew.  You made the biggest impact on my life.  I miss you @DumpsterDickie
@5Wolfe I do the same thing.  Except with cookies
Shai Hulud tonight!  Pumped as fuck!
I love when people at work notice my Harry Potter tattoo.  Even more so when they love Harry Potter as much as I do
I'm about to ring the neck of the guy using a Jackhammer on his porch at 10 in the morning
I keep getting into more and more bands without vocals.  Something about the progression of the music is inspiring to me
Haha! Promotion get! I is a shift supervisor now!
Toaster god damn!
Hail destroyer!
@PeripheryBand I may be two people off buy c'mon, I'm awesome.  You guys are awesome.  Let's be awesome together...forever
Under baked raspberry cheesecake cookies will forever be my cookie addiction
Avert your god damn eyes
This meeting best be worth my damn time.  I am not pulling an all nighter for nothing
@SeanGregston but what about our cookie adventures?!
Yup, I still hate AC/DC
I almost put my lighter in my mouth.  I really need to go to bed soon
And no longer #ETID bound. We were so close to Huntington!
#ETID bound!
@everytimeidie in Huntington tonight!  Clear your schedules kids!  This is going to be one to remember!
Thanks Blizzard.  Your new Scroll of Resurrection perks made my jaw hit the floor and makes me want to play WoW again.
@thunderkitty011 owes me a dollar. The burger king drive thru was open!
Look at that Chevy... Motherfucker all inspected and shit #vanproblems
Time to do a little car shopping tomorrow.  The poopster has just about hit its limits
It is official.  I have a new addiction to mints
@DSilky89 eh? eh?! 
Remember kids, just because you can "work with computers" doesn't mean you can't break electronics.  Watch your actions children.
One week till @everytimeidie .  This week is going to be a long one
Whenever someone starts to play The Gambler, I have to sing with it
Twin arteries flow with the pulse of one might heart #ISIS
@DSilky89 I was actually able to shut it off last night.  I was surprised lol
There was whiskey in the devils blood and there was blood in my cup #etid
I can now play Skyrim.  This is bad.  This is very bad
The new @everytimeidie album is dirty, grimy, and unpredictably good.  Album of the year guys!  I'm saying it now!
I can already tell this new bass head is going to sound nasty.  Vintage and gritty here I come!
Converge in the morning = HOLY SHIT LET'S DO THIS!
@DSilky89 keeps getting me into some awesome bands
@DSilky89 @SeanGregston 6MR 784
You promised me Broadway, you sold me cabaret #parabelle
I am proud to say that I have got @DSilky89 back into MtG.  Now to work on @shadowofspaz
"Her bottom half would make you bring back stuff that you didn't take" #shitmydadsays
Do I dare call work at 8 in the morning to see if checks are in?  I think so!
Be careful what you're looking at, because it might be looking back
@SeanGregston It honestly doesn't feel like a year.  It feels like just yesterday that I was sneaking into your room to get the laptop cable
Fools regret until they die.  Forgive yourself back to life
@DSilky89 at his finest 
This Protest the Hero station on Pandora is perfect for feeling pumped while washing dishes
Let me rephrase my last tweet: I want to hug babies.  Because they are cute. Like @WhitechapelBand
@Alexchapel You seriously make me want to murder babies with anticipation
@SeanGregston You make me want to find my DS so that I can go through White again
I take more mirror pictures than a teenage girl.  I'm oddly okay with this
Comfy new @PeripheryBand sweatshirt #fuckyeah 
I just want to tweet Periphery lyrics all day long
HAHA!  @PeripheryBand merch acquired!  Djentlemen unite!
@SeanGregston I thought that was what adults do!
Pre-workout music jam?  Periphery!
I just need to put all these Magic cards on eBay so that I can buy some new music gear.  They are just collecting dust
@SeanGregston True facts.  You were.  She even rubbed it.  Okay I lied about that part.
One time Ke$ha told me she liked my beard.  That's why I will always keep it
Aaaand it is Passenger.  I am still happy about this!
2 minutes and Periphery is supposed to release a new single.  The anticipation is killing me!  I'm hoping for Face Palm Mute
I am always so impatient when I am waiting on something I ordered online
@seangregston thats sex panther for you
60% of the time, it works all the time
I love when four minds can actually have a good, intelligent debate/conversation.  It is nights like this that I will always remember
Why is there a cute Basset Hound in my yard, that is also wearing an adorable sweater?  I wanna keep him!
The Popemobile: Nothing says faith in God like four inches of bulletproof glass
Your BF's about to get F'd in the B! #scottpilgrim
Periphery merch here I come!
You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
I liked it because you picked it
@SeanGregston Nah, it's just the lack of good genetics.  Keep dreaming ginger
@SeanGregston If we still lived together I would come up with a hilarious way to mess with you.  Like wear an alien outfit or something
My sleeping pattern has dramatically changed.  This will be very bad for that 10 am shift on Friday
@DSilky89 and I should get lightsabers tonight and have an epic battle at Ihop
Someone needs to bring me the Colors album by Between the Buried and Me for Valentines Day while I'm at work.  Or a lightsaber
Slappa da bass mon!
@notch I speak for all of America when I say hi!
@ShadowOfSpaz @DSilky89 Jamming tomorrow?  I demand it!
Holy shit I was an adorable 3 year old. Look at that outfit! 
Thanks to @mmorgan_carterr for helping a bro out!
@DSilky89 @ShadowOfSpaz Oh once I get the money, I am.  I am!
@ShadowOfSpaz Lol no.  I don't have the money for it right now.  I'm hoping me selling my Magic cards will give me enough for it
@ShadowOfSpaz @DSilky89 so I just found a super affordable 6 string bass to compliment that Omen 8
It's like Hoth outside right now
Like omg guys I'm such a nerd! 
There are few songs that beat the 32 minute epic that is Cassandra Gemini
Damn you snow!  You ruin my day of looking at gear I can never afford!
Also lightsabers.  I need them
I think music shop tomorrow to price some new gear!
@Dsilky89 is a damn jedi!
@shadowofspaz @Dsilky89 well ask around for people with 5 strings that want an acoustic guitar
@notch It is Friday.  Getting down on Friday
@ShadowOfSpaz You are now required to play stuff like this if you have an 8 string 
@shadowofspaz you find me someone selling one and ill buy it. Or willing to trade
@shadowofspaz ...but you has an 8 now! This makes me sad!
@shadowofspaz does this mean I can buy your 7 from you?
@ShadowOfSpaz @DSilky89 @Fornekation 10 pm showing on Friday with Ihop to follow?
I love how a simple Google search on the Conservation of mass can destroy a 'well thought out' idea that has no scientific weight
@ShadowOfSpaz @DSilky89 @Fornekation you dudes game for Star Wars on Friday or Saturday?
I have an affinity for 80s music, especially hair rock/metal.  #funfact
@SeanGregston #tatersgonnatate
I wish I had the horn of Gondor.  I would use it whenever I walked into a room
@seangregston "Isengard. They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard"
@seangregston tell me where is Gandalf for I have much desire to speak to him
Watching Lord of the Rings with my dad and its his first time watching it which means my knowledge of it is being put to the test
@Dsilky89 Oh you will totally get one!
Legos Star Wars Valentines? With stickers and poster!? Yes please!
Every time I wear my Alliance shirt I remember @SeanGregston yelling a certain phrase to someone when they yelled, "For the Alliance!"
Surprise steak salad for the win!
Every time I listen to or watch a Red Fang video I really want a PBR
Jesse Leach back in Killswitch Engage?  I foresee the best album since Alive or Just Breathing!
Who made your architect?
Crossing my fingers that my co-worker takes my shift tomorrow so that I can see #Hurt with @ShadowOfSpaz and @DSilky89  tomorrow
This half time show would be 100 times better with less Madonna and more of Nicki Minja's ass
@DSilky89 @SeanGregston @ShadowOfSpaz The scary thing is, is that it is probably true
My face kinda stings #slapbet
Ah, my favorite Dali piece as my Twitter background.  Now @SeanGregston get to work on getting me the print!
Did...did my brother just like the Isis song I posted?  #mindblown
@DSilky89 @speaksnake What can I say?  I take pride in muh facial hair
Beard has been trimmed very short. Now to grow it back all nice and even 
Yup, that song just made my night #SNL #BonIver
I just remembered #SNL is on tonight and I won't miss a minute of it because I'm already off work!  Helllll yeah!
@ShadowOfSpaz Grats buddy!
Nothing beats having to work at 9 and not being able to sleep.  #caffeineformealldaylong
"You see this right here?  This is sand.  Know what it's going to be in 100 years? SAND!"
Oceansize, assortment of blue drawing utensils, the looming thought of work at 9 am, and a creative spark. #myevening
Ain't no rest for the wicked, money don't grow on treeees
Lolol people never cease to amaze me. #youmustbetrollingbro
I get disappointed every time I sneeze because they are not like @SeanGregston sneezes that cause him to go super saiyan
I need a drummer that is willing to play sludge metal #ynodrummersinwv
The Human Abstract broke up?!  But at least At the Drive-In got back together.  That somehow evens it all out
@ShadowOfSpaz I'm here for you broseph if you need me
One thing I will always love about Star Wars is how even the smallest characters have huge back stories
It is such a lovely night out tonight.  #perfectweather
I'm a sick man, I'm a wicked man
I really need the new Trivium album in my car.  Dudes outdid themselves again
I'm half tempted to drop my acoustic guitar into either D standard or C standard to see what it sounds like
I love when AC Moore has super awesome sales on bulk cardstock!
Days with weather like this make me feel super creative
Oh man that one coffee only has one 'e' in it.  #sadpanda
I think I will treat myself to a venti white chocolate mocha with a shot of hazelnut and two extra shots of espresso today #coffeecoffe
Hmmmm to go into work and get 50 hours this week or to not, that is the question.
New Hacktivist song keeps blow my mind with how good it is
My brother is now considering getting a tattoo after seeing the one I got for our grandmother #ilovemybrothers
Symbols of the four nations from Avatar the Last Airbender and a Squirtle Squad Squirtle as my next two tattoos?  Shiiiit yeah!
These days are far from golden #Hacktivist
Drum roll, Please
@ShadowOfSpaz Fleet Foxes?!
Chinese Whispers #DEP
@SeanGregston All I do is win win win
Not only did I stay an extra two hours tonight to close, I also got 2 packs of smoke and 4 Red Bulls for doing so. #winning
Note to self:  Get another copy of the Alchemy Index by Thrice.  I could listen to Firebreather all day long
Evolve. Elapse. Expand. Adapt
@SeanGregston sucks mang. Hoping I didn't miss anything too important
I somehow slept through the meeting I was supposed to be at.  Fuuuuuuu
Uploading again because Twitter hates me sometimes 
Note to self in next life:  Tattoos close to your armpit hurt.  A lot
For my grandmother 
Always 
About to get the tattoo that I have waited for the longest
I should have went to bed an hour ago but I decided to watch @danieltosh instead.  Good decision?  I think so
I can't decide if I want to stop stretching my ears at 7/16 or 1/2 inch.  Decisions, decisions
I follow beard blogs for ideas on how to better trim/groom my beard #beardenthusiast
I'm starving but there is no food in the house.  I am half tempted to risk death by food by going to McDonald's this late
One more day then it is new tattoo time!  I seriously cannot express how excited I am!
@SeanGregston It's a twofor!
I saw a license plate today that said Mjölnir.  I squealed in joy
One day off this week but I am perfectly okay with that.  Let's do this!
Designing the finishing touches to my chest piece!  Super pumped!
@seangregston @fornekation I regret nothing!
@seangregston @fornekation I won't lie, I gained my freshman 15 then
Underwater Bimbos from Outer Space #ETID
@SeanGregston Operation MJ pooping his pants over Operation Colorado kicks off in t-minus...now!
Warm enough for me to roll down the windows and blare Dream Theater. Keeping traditions that @SeanGregston and I made.
Whitechapel coming to Huntington May 17th?  Hello early birthday gift!
Starting the day right with The Contortionist and Last Chance to Reason!
This is the time to turn down our heads and turn up our hearts
White Winter Hymnal will be my theme for this winter
I love writing music when it snows.  Something about it is just magical
I won't thank god, I'll thank my friends, for sticking by till we're home again
I worked the whole bag into it, I knew I could #shitmydadsays
I get really happy when I know that in May I will be watching my brother graduate #proudbrother
@SeanGregston You need to get an instrument so we can start our band: Captain Greg and the Seamen
I've gone through your photos a million times, but I'm still not in them
@ShadowOfSpaz I am off Thursday and Friday, if either one of those days are good for you
@ShadowOfSpaz just saying, I gots me a bass today
Alive or Just Breathing is still one of the best albums I have ever listened to
@ShadowOfSpaz Bring a boombox so we can have One Winged Angel play when we walk into iHop.  People need to know who we are
@LeanOnShenna Would you object to me selling a kidney to fund this?
@ShadowOfSpaz Shae! Respond. To. My. Text. Right. Meow.
Ihop for a third day in a row later tonight?  Yes please! @ShadowOfSpaz @Fornekation #ithinkimayhaveaproblem
"We hate Ted.  If you don't jump on board the sexting stops!" 'Teds a son of a bitch!" #ilovehimym
I love getting a text from my manager telling me that they lost my food handlers card.  Now I get to go to the class again, yay!
Time to see if I can watch just one episode of HIMYM before bed instead of the rest of season 6
When we want something we can't have, we just want it more
@ShadowOfSpaz I sat in my car listening to A Dramatic Turns of Events, waiting for the epic Final Fantasyish part
Ihop in the morning with some fantastic people! #excited!
@ShadowOfSpaz @SeanGregston @DSilky89 To the courthouse we ride!
@SeanGregston @ShadowOfSpaz Now all Shae needs is a Maid of Honor and we can do this!
@shadowofspaz and to seal the deal, I'm also getting a dramatic turn of events
@shadowofspaz will you, shae, be my bro for life?
@shadowofspaz just found meteroa for $10. Nostalgia here I come!
And as sure as the sky is blue we get lost. This is why I should've drove
This woman at ihop reeks of booze. Go. To. Bed. Drunkie.
Either I will find religion on this trip or I will take over driving duties
I'm half certain I have sanitize water burns on my knuckles
@SavannaahJane So cute! I remember that episode too!
@SavannaahJane You forgot to attach the picture, silly!
The only reason I will have the lyrics: "I set fire to the rain" is because of this wonderful mash-up between Adele and @Skrillex
Snagging the Whitechapel discography, new Vildjharta album, and new Born of Osiris album in preparation for a possible trip to PA
@SeanGregston @ShadowOfSpaz @SarraSaturday @DSilky89 HEY!  I am a solider in spirit!
@ShadowOfSpaz Just make sure he knows that giving you frost bite doesn't mean he wins
Decided to try and conquer old man winter.  Get to gas station, get a drink, then turn around.  You win this time old man...
@ShadowOfSpaz Favorited is the new lawyered!
@ShadowOfSpaz the amount of nerd in that was...inspiring
@ShadowOfSpaz You'll like it till you enter the Mist
@ShadowOfSpaz Aren't you glad you aren't at Camp Dawson right now making SNOW ANGELS! and staring out your window?
Hey snow!  Stop snowing!  I would like to cash my paycheck today.  Kthanks
Apparently if you drive into a snow storm and turn on your headlights, it looks like you are going into hyperspace.  Awesome but not fun
A plate of pizza rolls, an episode of #HIMYM, the new #ETID song, and I think I am ready for work
Sleep on, fly on.  In your mind, you can fly
#Btbam, the brunch of champions!
I am feeling really creative tonight but also extremely intellectual.  I enjoy nights like this
@ShadowOfSpaz I remember we listened to one of the Hurt albums one night a couple years ago and I was hooked on them for a couple weeks
Thanks to @ShadowOfSpaz I am addicted to Sweet Delilah by Hurt
That awesome moment when you get your dad addicted to How I Met Your Mother #awesomedadisawesome
Is it bad that I love my beard so much that I just shampoo'd and conditioned it?
@seangregston I cannot wait till us four to all get together. Gonna be a night to remember!
The dredg station on Pandora is amazing. Dredg, tool, apc, explosions in the sky; the list goes on!
@ShadowOfSpaz got to love when two people of different beliefs can have a rational discuss about religion #bestfriendsforlife
@ShadowOfSpaz Grats man!
I am too nice to tell these customers that we are closed and to leave. Yaay for being at work even longer
Fact: I love The Bravery.  Seriously, the dudes make some of the best music
Quote of the night: how is this not a fuckin pie?
In our minds adventure is always listening
My car just hit 158k miles! The poopster keeps going!
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride, ain't nothing gonna slow me down
Part of me wants to drive to Morgantown and partake in the mass party that is probably taking place #WVU
Sitting inside my car at the edge of the earth.  I turned my head to the left and knew I could not be drugged #Volumes
@SavannaahJane No no no no, you're welcome
@SeanGregston Nah I think the bowl is filled with oranges or some fruit of that variety
So hey guys, I heard something about a bowl game or something? #WVU
@seangregston This looks pretty shooped to me
@shadowofspaz would you like a footlong brostrami?
@SeanGregston take it all!
Why must it snow on the one day I drive to work?
@LeanOnShenna @ShadowOfSpaz He just doesn't want to admit he is one of the cool kids that loves HIMYM
Drake, Structures, Fleet Foxes, The Ocean and Every Time I Die is all I have been listening to these past few days.  #widevarietyofmusic
@ShadowOfSpaz @SeanGregston Seriously Shae, the things you say just set yourself up for this stuff
@SeanGregston I just noticed your tweet about Kraken.  KRAKEN!
Snow we meet again #punpunpun
@ShadowOfSpaz @TehDixon &lt;3
@ShadowOfSpaz I could make your Twitter about as PG as a SAW movie.  But I'm nice and so I won't
New @everytimeidie album comes out two days before their Huntington show!  Supa pumped!
Even though @ShadowOfSpaz probably hates my inappropriate tweets, he still loves me
@ShadowOfSpaz You mean you love touching old friends? See what I did there?
@ShadowOfSpaz hangs with MJ!
#FleetFoxes all night long
Lines of hair 
Hair like coffee 
Me: "Sweet old cup of coffee!" Dad: "Why do you need that?" Me: "To paint with!" Dad: "What the hell is wrong with you?"
@ShadowOfSpaz Hey, what's our next song?!
We cannot let our past scare us into not doing something that seems so right
@ShadowOfSpaz You really do need to.  A movie/graphic novel about music and video games?  It is the perfect movie
You're pretentious, this club sucks, I have beef. Let's do it. #scottpilgrimquotesalldayeveryday
You are a cinema, I could watch you forever
He was referring to boobs @shadowofspaz
Words of wisdom from @shadowofspaz : if I had a rack I'd keep it out
Laying down some sweet tunes with @shadowofspaz !
@SeanGregston @ShadowOfSpaz Hoping all you guys have a great New Years!  It is the year of the Reckoning!
Scott Pilgrim has one of the best soundtracks
Friends and family, ignore @ShadowOfSpaz s last tweet.  Or correct his spelling errors
*Unsheathe :D
@ShadowOfSpaz Hypocrite*
:D
@ShadowOfSpaz Tweet certain power ups and what not?  That'd be rad!  And yes we need to collaborate more!  That was amazing music!
@ShadowOfSpaz One month?  It'd probably be my avatar for the rest of eternity!
@SeanGregston We miss you man!  But you will be here soon, just keep looking forward! #brotherstilltheend
@ShadowOfSpaz Dude, I think we hit the highest level of epic nerd brain storming possible!
Contours #moleskin 
Meditate 
@shadowofspaz shae! I wanna write dnd stuff today! orcus commands your awakening!
@ShadowOfSpaz #nerdsforlife
@ShadowOfSpaz It was so epicly evil that even Orcus trembled!
@ShadowOfSpaz Not sure yet but I'm sure I can help for a few hours!
@ShadowOfSpaz I did that before and you still surprised me with encounters!  Just keep names and locations hush hush
@ShadowOfSpaz Someone to carry around your books and bring you coffee lol
@ShadowOfSpaz I think we are, lol.  Crazy stuff man!
@ShadowOfSpaz Dude...I was literally just thinking of this yesterday
I went from Drake to Salt the Wound this morning. ny music taste knows no bounds
Watching an infomercial for some pants and my dad says about someones ass, "Looks like a hamburger" #shitmydadsays
I could sit and just draw lines in different patterns for hours and hours.  It is my own personal meditation
New moleskin = best Christmas gift this year!
I may look like a fool in this forever lazy but I am forever warm while naked now
@everytimeidie Huntington, WV!  Last show of the tour = best after party!
Currently letting the idea sink in that I will be seeing @everytimeidie in March thanks to @SeanGregston s amazing Christmas gift!
Everyone look at me, I'm a vagabond, on the run from the law, don't you see? #probablythebestlyricsivewritten
Had my first White Russian with @ShadowOfSpaz tonight!  Was delicious!
@DumpsterDickie I just wanted to let you know, you will always be an inspiration to me.  You always had a smile on your face.
@SeanGregston We are always here man.  Keeping things together, one day at a time
@SeanGregston I still remember Shaes Halloween party where you gathered us all in a circle.  Funny but touching.  White Russians for us!
@Gregamondo Berb moving everyone to Colorado so we can!
A little bit of @PeripheryBand before work is just what the doctor ordered!
@ShadowOfSpaz if you need me man, let me know.  I am only a hop and a skip away
White chocolate mocha with two extra shots of espresso and a shot of hazelnut is the best thing you can ever order at Starbucks
