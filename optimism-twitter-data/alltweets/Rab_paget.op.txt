@iainmartin1 @LAHinds Labour died the day they joined the Tories during the Indy ref and Scotland never forgave them
@LAHinds waiting on a report from Mercedes on the impact it will have on my engine and gear box driving in low gears
@LAHinds earnings will be less due the fact my job totals will reduce due the fact it will take longer to complete a fare!
@LAHinds re: the 20mph law being bad for the environment ( vehicles in low gears ) and the impact on my earnings as a taxi driver
@LAHinds still no reply to my questions?
@LAHinds The ones who were against the worst traffic regulation to ever be introduced to our fine city.., It wasn't unanimous LH
@LAHinds SNP or not I will vote against them at local level and will also ask every taxi driver in Edinburgh to do so also..
#tacticalvoting
@LAHinds also the impact of driving in low gears will have on my gearbox and the environment ?
@LAHinds can you tell me how I'm going to make up the shortfall in my earnings as a taxi driver due to me doing less jobs per shift??
@LAHinds well aware of that :) roll on the next council elections
@DougBrownCabbie 20mph speed restriction says it all for me!!!
