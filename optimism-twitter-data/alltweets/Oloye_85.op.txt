Positive anything is better than negative thinking.
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic.
It is the false shame of fools to try to conceal wounds that have not healed.

No relationship is ever a waste of your time. If it didn’t bring you what you want, it taught you what you don’t want.
Never chase love, affection, or attention. If it isn’t given freely by another person, then it isn’t worth having.
Be with someone who brings out the best in you, not the stress in you

Give thanks for what you are now, and keep fighting for where you want to be.
Don’t lose yourself trying to love someone.
No matter how far you go in the wrong direction, there's always a chance to turn your life around.
You can't be good enough for everybody, but you'll always be the best for the one who deserves you.
I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish i knew what that reason was.

Its been God.
Nobody is ever "too busy", If they're interested, they'll make time.
Only you can control your happiness.
In life you will meet two kinds of people. Ones who build you up, and ones who tear you down. But in the end, you will thank them both.
You'll end up real disappointed if you think people will do for you as you do for them. Not everyone has the same heart as you.
Happiness is a choice, not a result. Nothing will make you happy until you choose to be happy.
There's always something good coming. Remember that.
Its a bright day today, Happy last day of the year and a Happy new year in advance

Keep people in your life who truly love you, motivate you, and make you happy. If you know people who do none of these things, let them go.
I don't care what people think, because people don't think.
Stop overthinking, you're only creating problems that aren't there.
People may not tell you 
how they feel about you, 
but they always show you. 
Pay attention.
Try a little harder to be a little better.
Overthinking will kill you, just relax.
Forgive yourself for your mistakes.
Don't stress over things you can't change, change do u can.
My life isn't perfect. But I'm grateful for what I do have.
Don't overthink it.
Relax and let it go.
Never waste feelings on people who don't value them.
Think positive and positive things will happen.
Don't judge what you don't know.
When people change, the memories don't.
Don't be afraid to start over. It's a brand new opportunity to rebuild what you truly want.
Whatever you decide to do, make sure it makes you happy.
No matter what, you'll be judged. So be yourself.
#THANK you JESUS!

Be happy. Be who you want to be. If others don't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasing everybody.
No matter how good or bad your life is, wake up each morning and be thankful that you still have one.
When something bad happens, you have 3 choices: You can either let it define you, destroy you, or let it strengthen you.
Do what makes you happy, and be with who makes you smile.
Sometimes it takes a good fall to know where you stand.
Sometimes you have to stop worrying, wondering, and doubting and just have faith that things will work out.
People come and go. But life is simply about seeing who cares enough to stay.
Your worst battle is between what you know and what you feel.
Life becomes easier when you let go of the unneeded stress. If it's out of your control, don't let it worry you.
Do I knw the things you take for granted is what someone else is praying for?
Don't feel sad over someone who gave up on you, feel sorry for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them.
Love needs no proof, all it needs is a hand to hold in difficult times and the ability to make your loved one smile.
You can't lose what you never had, you can't keep what's not yours &amp; you can't hold on to something that doesn't want to stay.
Never respond to negativity or ignorance, it's not even worth your time.
You can forget what hurt you in the past, just never forget what it taught you.
Time decides who you meet in life, your heart decides who you want in your life and your actions decide who stays in your life.
Whoever is trying to bring you down, is already below you.
Be thankful for what you are now, and keep fighting for what you want to be tomorrow.
Distance sometimes lets you know who's worth keeping and who's worth letting go.
When one door of happiness closes, another opens. Often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that opened for us.
Sometimes we expect more from other people, because we are willing to do that much for them.
I've learnt dat Pain makes people change.
If someone messes up, let it go. If they keep messing up, let them go.
Surround yourself with people who are going to lift you higher.
Don't judge what you don't know.
Don't say what you can't show.
Don't hate what you can't have.
Don't love what you can't trust.

Character is much easier to maintain than to recover.
When you truly love someone you don't judge them by their past, you accept it and leave it there.
Relationships fail because of trust issues, commitment issues and communication issues. So trust, commit, and communicate always.
No matter how “busy” a person’s day may be. If they “really care”, they’ll always find time for you.
Don't over-think. You'll create a problem that wasn't even there in the first place!
It's never too late to start over, never too late to be happy.
Some people don’t understand how blessed they truly are. Be thankful for what you have rather than focusing on what you don’t have.
A girl can be your best friend, wife, worst enemy, or worst nightmare. It just depends on how you treat her.
When you forgive, stop bringing it up. No one wants to be around someone who constantly makes them feel guilty.
Stay positive, about everything. A positive mind set will determine your happiness.
Everybody has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were.
Letting go is never easy, but sometimes it's necessary.
Forgive someone because you believe they are truly sorry, not just because you want to keep them in your life.
Don't let your happiness depend on other people.
One lie can ruin a thousand truths, b truthful.
Don't let a bad yesterday ruin a good today.
Stay strong, make them wonder how you're still smiling!
You'll never understand until it happens to you.
No matter how good or bad you think life is, wake up each day and be thankful for life. Someone somewhere else is fighting to survive.
#5 Rules of happiness 
*1. Don't Hate 
*2. Don't Worry 
*3. Give More 
*4. Expect Less 
*5. Live Simply.
Appreciate what you have right now, because you don't always get a second chance.
You can’t change how people feel about you, so don’t try. Just live your life and be happy.
Don't ask for someone's opinion then get mad when they tell you the truth.
Hard times will always reveal true friends.
Never lose sight of what means the most to you.
Think positive and positive things will happen.
Sometimes we have to choose between what we want and what makes us really happy.

Sometimes, the smallest decision can make the greatest impact in your life.
The best way to avoid disappointment is to not expect anything from anyone.
It’s your life. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for living it your way.
In life, there are some people you're going to have to lose in order to find yourself.
Stop caring what people think. Stop taking caution in your actions, listen to what you want, do what you want, this is your life. Live it.
Never give up. Great things take time.
When something bad happens you have three choices; You can either let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.
Accept what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Don’t let someone change who you are, to become what they need.
The only person you have to be better than is the person you were yesterday.
Life is very short, so forgive quickly, believe slowly, love truly, laugh loudly and never avoid anything that makes you smile.
Time decides who you meet in life, your heart decides who you want in your life and your behavior decides who stays in your life.
Don't ask God to make your life easier, ask him to make you a stronger person.
The only people you need in life are the ones that need you in theirs.
You know life is worth the struggle when you look back on what you lost, and realize what you have now is way better than before.
Why do we close our eyes when we pray, cry, kiss or dream? Because the most beautiful things in life are not seen but felt by heart.
Happiness comes when we stop complaining about the troubles we have and offer thanks for all the troubles we don't have. Life is a gift!
SMILE, It will make you look better. PRAY, it will keep you strong. LOVE, it will make you enjoy life.

When life is sweet, say thank you and celebrate. When life is bitter, say thank you and grow.
On the road to success, there's a curve called failure, a loop called confusion, speed bumps called friends and red lights called enemies.
Happy are they who take life day by day, complain very little, and are thankful for the little things in life.
The moment you feel like giving up, remember all the reasons you held on for so long.
Leave the past in the past.
Never be afraid to start over, It's a new chance to rebuild what you want.
The second you stop caring about things that bring you down is the second you start living.
Before you assume... There's this thing called "asking".
Hold on to whatever keeps you happy.
Overthinking creates problems that weren't there.
Successful people never worry about what others are doing.
Let your past make you better, not bitter.

To face the truth hurts, but to deal with lies is even worse.
Dear God, Help me to understand that difficult times can make me stronger in the end, even though it may not always be easy to see.
Never ignore a person who loves you and cares for you.
Sometimes the wrong choices bring us to the right places.
You are responsible for your own happiness.
Sometimes the best way to appreciate something is to be without it for a while.
Sometimes you have to do what's best for you and your life, not what's best for everybody else.
Everything will get better soon. Just hang in there and don't worry about it too much.
People are going to talk, whether you're doing bad or good. Worry about yourself before you worry about what others think.
Don't give up hope. Things always have a way of working out.
Remember the good times, be strong during the difficult times, love always, laugh often, and thank God for every day.
Don't ruin other people's happiness just because you can't find your own.
Never stress over things you can't change. The past is in the past, and it's not worth your attention.
Sometimes life doesn't want to give you something you want, not because you don't deserve it, but because you deserve more.
I can't afford to hate anyone. I don't have that time.
You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.
Be strong enough to let go and wise enough to wait for what you deserve.
No relationship is ever a waste of time. If it didn't bring you what you want, it taught you what you don't want.
If someone doesn't appreciate your presence, make them appreciate your absence.
Never be afraid to start over. It's a chance to rebuild your life the way you wanted all along.
Don't let your happiness depend on something you might lose build it on what u'll have forever.
Start believing that things are going to change for the better. Not because you deserve it, but simply because God loves you that much.
Sometimes you have to act like you don't care, even when you do.
Stay strong, because things will get better. It might be stormy now, but it can't rain forever.
Don't chase people. Be you, do your own thing and work hard. The right people who belong in your life will come to you, and stay.
If you really want to be happy, then stop being afraid of being yourself &amp; stop thinking about what others think of you. Just be you.
Always remember, God will never take anything away from you without the intention of replacing it with something much better.
Don't judge me for my choices when you don't understand my reasons.
Always pray to have eyes that see the best, a heart that forgives the worst, a mind that forgets the bad, and a soul that never loses faith.
Just because you can't see the air, doesn't mean you stop breathing. Just because you can't see God doesn’t mean you stop believing.
Good things come to those who believe, Better things come to those who wait and the best things come to those who don't give up.
When something bad happens, you have 3 choices: You can either let it define you, destroy you, or let it strengthen you.
God has perfect timing; never early, never late. It takes a little patience and faith, but it’s worth the wait.
Its funny how you can do nice things for people all the time and they never notice. But once you make one mistake, its never forgotten.
Stop letting others influence your decisions. Make your own choices and stand by them, you will always be better off.
If you're easy to get, you'll be easy to forget.
Cutting negative people out of your life doesn't mean you hate them, it just means you respect yourself.
One of the best feelings is when someone understands you without you having to say anything.
Don't judge a situation you've never been in.

Yesterday was yesterday, focus on today.
Be thankful for the struggles you go through. They make you stronger and wiser. Don't let them break you. Let them make you.
Don't be afraid of change. You may end up losing something good, but you will probably end up gaining something better.
When something bad happens, you have 3 choices: You can either let it define you, destroy you, or let it strengthen you.
GOD always has something for you, a key for every problem, a light for every shadow, a relief for every sorrow &amp; a plan for every tomorrow.
Don't ever regret meeting anyone in life, one day you will realize they taught you the most important lesson in your life!
Stop regretting, overthinking, and worrying about things you can't change.
Being nice to someone you don't like doesn't mean you're fake, it means you're mature enough to tolerate your dislike for them.
Never give up. Always find a reason to keep trying.
Hold on to whatever keeps you happy.
Just stay positive, it will get better.
Since you know people are going to judge you anyway, why not do whatsoever you wanted to do?

If someone is talking behind your back, that means that your life is obviously more interesting than theirs.
Do something now that will make the person you'll be tomorrow proud to have been the person you are today.
Spend life with the people who make you happy, not the people who you have to impress.
Never judge anyone, everyone has a story.
Life doesn't get easier, we just get stronger.
If you worry about what others will say about you then you will not end up anywhere in life cause whatever you do, people will talk.
Life is all about making choices. Always do your best to make the right ones, and always do your best to learn from the wrong ones.
Life is a gift. Never take it for granted.
Keep the faith, keep working hard and great things will come.

Stop regretting things and start accepting them as the teachers they are.
Don't be reckless with other peoples' hearts, and don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.
Never change your originality for the sake of others. Be yourself. Nobody can play your role better than you. You are the best at who you...
If you don't believe in yourself, who will?
Never waste your feelings on people who don't value them.
Two things define you. Your patience when you have nothing and your gratitude when you have everything
Fake people are no different than shadows, they stick around during your brightest moments, but disappear during your darkest hours.
Be thankful for the bad things in life. For they open your eyes to the good things you weren't paying attention to before.
Don't waste your time giving someone a second chance, when there is someone better out there waiting for their first.
Grudges are a waste of perfect happiness. Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can't change.
