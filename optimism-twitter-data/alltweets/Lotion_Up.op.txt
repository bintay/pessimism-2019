@piercemobley_15 and it would be awful for someone to go to a job that requires safety and that person to be high and not fully evaluate

I hate cigarettes.  I will never smoke them. And I'm glad cayne feels the same way. I don't think I could be with someone who smokes
@Antivxst I think that'd be rad!
I have to start planning with my college for the transfer. Get furniture, get an apartment in florida, get a car, and get married to cayne.
Mrs. Chippeaux sc me saying she's having surgery tomorrow and to be good with the sub. I don't ever do anything lmao
@Antivxst really? Well my tattoo didn't hurt at all and everyone said it would in the spot I got it in

@chouderkirk caynes 365 he's in brand new buildings there that are T shaped
@chouderkirk so almost the same amount. Well you can always visit him more since he's close. What's his squadron?
@chouderkirk he is done April 23, he's been in tech school for 5 months now. What about yours?
@chouderkirk he started around Jan. 20th at sheppard. But his first half of tech was in Mississippi and that was in nov.
@chouderkirk I went in February and I understand completely. I'm happy that he gets to come back with no complications :)
@chouderkirk I know you're so lucky !
@Rynoceros_94 I wish I could actually go to your wedding . But I will see pictures and maybe video?

All this heat.
I feel pretty and thin when I'm by myself. Then I go shopping or out with people and I realize I'm not pretty and I'm fat.
I'm not gonna be convenient for you guys. I'm not here for when no one else wants to hangout with you. <VICTORY HAND>

Plus if someone wanted to stay in contact the phone works both ways. But people obviously don't understand that.
After highschool i don't plan on really staying in touch with people. Like we are all gonna go separate ways.
I feel so alone since cayne left. Like he was my greatest best friend and we always had really good times together. And it just sucks now.
Tonight is nice I just wanna go out <HUSHED FACE>
I didn't have any excuse to not do that project, I didn't even go out xD
@_oneblondegirl I agree ! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
But I'm gonna wait till he proposes. Cuz we can't live together until we are married
@Swimmer_babe @braylonharris97  shit man that was hella savage
I'm tempted to not go to college and just move to florida. I don't want to wait another year. But it'd be stupid of me not to go to college
Isn't it funny when people decide to start talking to you because you become relevant in their life?
Need to get a job asap
Literally did nothing over break. No homework or went out
Putting clothes on barbies was my only specialty for awhile

Trying to control my anixiety, depression, and bi - polar is such a struggle and it literally takes everything out of me
I'm finding it harder and harder to even go to prom. I don't think I'll enjoy it. I can't go to senior breakfadt
I have way too big of boobs for every dress. The dresses that do fit and look good are too exspensive. I'm alone again this year.
Big possibility of getting a breast reduction surgery! I would love to just be an A cup suze

@haileyperson96 thanks I've been to every dress store here and still no luck <ANGUISHED FACE> but I'm still going to look
Prom dress shopping sucks when you have big boobs, chubby, and short. Makes me not even want to go to prom
I'm a realist I don't try to do make beleive and yet everyone gets so offended. Sorry honey I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear
You are what we call a seasonal friendship.
Next year walking on campus: dear lord please let a car hit me and pay for my college.

Fuck you. Fuck this.
I have like no words to say at this point. Fuck boys everywhere

I'm just gonna say this now I'm pretty mad at you rn.
Ditching me isn't all that great. Just to let you know
@raddish__ oh ok ! My skin is the only thing peeling. It's almost done tho
@raddish__ that's not good at all. I don't really even have scabs.
Don't ever just date someone just to fuck.
I think my tattoo is starting to peel
Or do we want starving, unhealthy women walk down the run way like we live in a country that can barely feed our people.
@Rynoceros_94 I dare you to tell cayne that lmao
And there goes your life... good job <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
I'm really not in the mood for you rn. So yeah.
@CayneZacharias I love you so much too!
I hate getting really dumb songs stuck in my head :c
No matter how you feel about yourself is ok <WHITE SMILING FACE>
It's looking at yourself and accepting what you see. :) and if you also struggle with your image that's ok because you're not alone
I have self image issues but if you dont that's ok too! if you feel good about yourself then I'm happy for you! It's not being egotistical
Because sometimes people actually struggle with self esteem issues. And that shouldn't be glamorized or romanticized.
Because if you take that picture and show me I will feel bad about myself for the rest of the time. And I will not feel good at all
When I say please don't take a picture of me, I'm not trying to act cute and secretly wanting you to take a picture.
@piercemobley_15 anytime man and thank you I really appreciate that:)
@piercemobley_15 you're a really good leader and I know you'll be great at it!

A scar, or a roadblock that carries with them for life. Let's put more rapists in jails than the streets.
And no what she wore doesn't matter, maybe teaching men and women that rape is a disgusting thing then maybe, just maybe people won't have
And no it doesn't "happen for a reason" and yes men can be raped too. Let's get out heads out of this rape culture
I swear if someone tries to justify rape around me I will not be afraid to hit you with a bat. No she is not a slut.No she didn't ask for it

Someone should do my eyebrows for me

But then again I like having longish hair
I kinda want to cut my hair short for a couple reason:
1. It's too heavy and looks flat
2. It needs to have a new life
3. It's so bland rn
Black beauty sets the mood so well. <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS><ROSE>
It's disappointing and sad.
I swear roles have switched, where girls are more thirsty for attention than anything.
I wouldn't have to worry about other girls with my boyfriend if girls now and days would respect a relationship instead of being a whore.

Trust me I'm a crazy bitch with a high imagination. But I can be the nicest person you know. :)
Cuz that's really what I want to do to some people. Without your looks no one would want you. Point blank.
Putting sulfuric acid in a perfume bottle and giving it to the person who has the ugliest personality and watch them turn into who they are
Who are you to judge.
Doing the same thing that cop did but now against them.  It doesn't make you right. It makes you the same.
If you defend mike brown by saying all cops are racist. Then you have defeated the point. It's called justice not the blame game.
Seriously people. The person who has done wrong should be the only person who gets all the shit. Not blaming a whole for one persons actions
Stop it. Be the one who stands up for the innocent instead of targeting them. Isn't this all what it's about?
That's like saying all whites are neonazis.
That's like all Asians are bad drivers.
That's like saying all Hispanics are poor.
That's like saying all black people are thieves.
Gonna literally physically hit someone if I here "every cop is racist" what a dumb trend. Not all cops are racist.
Just a reminder to people all over, cops are humans too. Not all of them are bad. They get targeted as well cuz of a uniform

Drunk or high you can get every weekend. Talking about stress that hasn't really hit you yet. So get your head straight and realize the real
Like right now we should probably focus on good grades and getting through school to start creating a better future for ourselves.  Not how
