@michaeliot I am really freaking happy to see you so optimistic. This tweet made my day.
@michaeliot welp. My dog and I will be over all the time then. Just a fair warning.
@michaeliot Near the university or what? And are dogs aloud?
@michaeliot Doggy play date at your place? No ulterior motive or anything. . .
@tylerjewell11 get rekt scrublord
@michaeliot If you're reading this then you did NOT die in your sleep and you're still able to enjoy things like this 
@michaeliot For me it was the cinematography.It was just so outlandish and addicting and it never got old but also didn't get in the way.
@michaeliot Seeing every last detail on Leslie Knope's face will just be a bonus then I'm guessing
#RescueBots Optimus be like "OMG I dont have time to deal with these random new Autobots. Here Heatwave have at em"  @BryanScarrell
@michaeliot LIKE A BOSS!
Lol "journey to the force awakens" novels? How long till they never really happened just like AN ENTIRE OTHER BOOKSHELF? @BryanScarrell
@michaeliot Wait, you're not?!

@_Pepper_Roni Finally got the roughs done for a 10 pg LEGO Island fancomic! If all goes well it's done in a month!! 
@michaeliot XD  Haha niiiicccee!!!!  Thanks, Michael XD
@michaeliot Every person is self absorbed. Dont hate urself cause you obviously care about others as well and u should know thats important
@michaeliot U hate yourself after you've helped and looked after someone?At least recognize you know when to do what's right
@michaeliot Are they paying you to say this?Reply with more praises of the place for yes and reply with more praises of the place for no
@michaeliot Hey, you're being honest.  Better that than lying about a skin condition cause you might see him around again.
@michaeliot I was pretty dang impressed.
I think #transformers by @TheJohnBarber and @glovestudios is seriously at it's best this month. That last page though. So great.
@michaeliot Alright, you win everything ever because the new profile pic is the greatest thing ever
@michaeliot LOVE IT! You had better keep it up.
@michaeliot how can we both pick sides when we know nothings right?
@michaeliot omg you and your profile pics pffft overload of awesome

@michaeliot I LOVE THAT SHOW OMG
@michaeliot Seem fine to me!
@michaeliot Oi. Blocked u again by accident!! Sorry!!! Hate this phone. . . U know the drill. . . (sorry)
@michaeliot OMG I totally forgot earlier 
@michaeliot self worth or not, you care about others and thats incredible. Oh, and you are seriously not giving yourself enough credit.
@michaeliot You seriously believe this? You literally just mentioned your mom and your dog earlier. Pretty sure they would. I'd care too.
@michaeliot No, no. I'm almost entirely certain you're in the hundreds on that scale.
@michaeliot U should know this already but a bachelors degree in general is a great thing to have. Don't be so down on that part of ur life.
@michaeliot Thanks!
I can't send you direct messages until you follow me again (because I accidentally blocked you my bad so sorry) @michaeliot
I accidentally blocked you for a second my bad!! You're unblocked now!! Sorry. . . @michaeliot

@michaeliot I'm glad to hear it. I bet it was a frikking teenager who thought it was funny. Makes me sick. I'm so sorry that happened.
@michaeliot jesus the poor thing. . . Eating/sleeping regularly and everything?

Me: Knock knock
@BryanScarrell : Who's there?
Me: Horton hears a
Bryan: Horton hears a- -

Bryan: You're an idiot.
@michaeliot Happy valentines! BTW Didn't get a chance to say it afterward but you were AWESOME in the show tonight. 
@michaeliot sounds eventful at least!
@michaeliot (harmonizing) I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU (when the rain starts to pour). . . (sorry couldn't resist)
@michaeliot knowing my puppy is waiting for me at home is usually what keeps me going.

#TweetForBowls 
@michaeliot Again, I'll say it; I haven't know you long, but I still think you're great.So you have shortcomings. Who doesn't?
@michaeliot That's not dumb to say at all.Most people  judge before they care to do anything else.Who needs them? 
@michaeliot I know I havent known you long,nor do I know you all that well,but thats never the impression I got from you.I think youre great
@jroberts332 Is Rung's moped another reference to Arrested Development?
@michaeliot Next weekend! Lets do it!! Imma get owned.
@michaeliot i'd say "let's do it" but I suck so hard at that game. . .
@michaeliot :) nah. You're the best.
@michaeliot OH WAIT I'M NOT DONE 
@michaeliot :) hope I helped.  And if not I tried.
@michaeliot Riding a bike is good exercise if you're a little husky. 
@michaeliot Did you do what I suggested and make a list of what makes you happy? If so read it again. If not, do it. 
@michaeliot  I'm going to keep tweeting puppy pictures at you until you smile. 
I drew Chromedome.  #MTMTE

"I need help with something that's seriously affecting me.I've peed 3 times in the last hour.What's happening to my life?" @BryanScarrell
"I am the foo-el" - Me, @Go_Faster_Wings, 2015
@michaeliot "Drain all of their blood.  Even if it kills them."  Truly a masterpiece in terms of dialogue.
@michaeliot  Nope. Best movie of the summer.You must've missed the rock solid plot, character development, and amazing acting.
@CorbinBolies @NickelodeonTV Thank you!! Can't wait!! Really looking foward to any extras like interviews about that finale.
@NickelodeonTV When is the DVD of Season 4 coming out? Because I am really looking forward to it.

RETWEET for Avatar Korra
FAVOURITE for Avatar Aang 
(7)I've got some other ideas too. Like potato clocks. @BryanScarrell
(6)Of course, you still have to turn the pencil over to do that, I guess.Where I get you is buying replacement erasers. Lotta money in that.
(5)With this you just have to turn the pencil perpendicular to the paper, press a button, and the eraser shoots across the page, erasing.
(4)I've had some pretty great ideas recently, like spring-loaded erasers.  I hate that you have to turn your pencil around to erase.
(3)I think I'll do that for a while, you know, just be a drifter.Then about twenty years down the line I'll start a few businesses. Maybe 3.
(2)But I'll show up at sites and offer help.  At the end of the day, if they liked my work, they pay me. If not, then I'll be on my way.
(1)I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do with my life.  I think I'll go into construction.  Like, not management or anything.
@MtthwClmn Love it!! Supported!! :)
@IDWPublishing WOOO!!! Can't wait!!!  THANK YOU!!
@MtthwClmn XD Are you still making that G2 series?  Every time I try to record dialogue it ends up really bad sounding so sorry about that.
