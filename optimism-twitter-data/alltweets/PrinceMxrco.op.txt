@TeeyonceLondon nah I need to go watch that now <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@TeeyonceLondon it's too mad. Hey just finished the episode like that
#Merky
When all I did was safe sex, latex, the first time that I slipped up wish they had a homemade aids test
By being cheeky 
Yeah 
Joker 
Dream car, the other shit is sorted  
Wolverine 
Super speed 
Unlock my phone  
Murphy 
True happiness 
Kobe 
Whoring daughter 
THAT WAS THE CHEEKIEST
What have I done? <BROKEN HEART>
I just don't like shit coming back to haunt me
No chip, no vodka
I've started caring too much
Shit had me feeling like a bitch already
Fam I'm moving soooo sarft but I really don't care
I start panicking and shit
I can't even help feeling nervous when I think about it
I really don't care anymore
That shit don't help at all
And I'm already hella stubborn. Thanks Dad
And everyone is saying its the way I think it is which make me more stubborn
Everyone has something to say about it
And I can't explain it
So I just wonder why
But I know they ride for me especially her
I feel like I'm so sure of the shit I've heard and seen
But now I can't hear anything from anyone easily
Can't let people bend you to their will
I've had to be so sure of myself
Within myself and with people
Lord knows all I want is peace
Christmas where?
And as I get older these problems only seem to get worse
That's how I started drinking. Not for bants. I had problems that drink would numb
I'll rather be fucked up that over thinking
I'm scared. I can't lie
I think that'll be it. Game Over
I won't be able to deal with that
But I ain't tryna lose the people around me now
I know the way I've moved has changed things and no one can deny that
But there's still so much more to go
There's certain things I won't even remember anymore the drink numbed it all
I know how many times I've tried to drink to forget shit
Because now I ain't tryna let anyone close enough to do damage
It's my fault for allowing these bullshit people in
Because there's too many pieces to put together
I hope it ain't past the point of fixing
People were there but there's only so much they can do
And all the times people who were closest at the time fucked me up it's felt like I've been rebuilding by myself
Clipped you know. I was never this closed before. Shy yeah but this?
Like I've been fucking clipped
Fam I've lost so much confidence in life and in myself
I can't talk to my niggas like I used to. Shit got my mind fucked up
I don't even feel the same no more
Gone from so optimistic and happy to some paranoid pessimist
And I know people have seen the changes in me
*I can't fully
Been around too many of them I fully trust the people I'm around now
These fake friends wanting to see you fail got me fucked up
Misjudged a lot of people
Sharing blood don't make these people loyal to you
One persons been there from the start till now and even then we've had our shit
Some people come and go, some people come late
No one stays around forever
And now days people move so reck
Been around and witnessed too many 2 faced people
I've let so much shit slide
But if you know all the shit that's happened you'll know why I move so cautious. Moving like some soap opera
I know there's people who I haven't given a chance or stopped giving a chance for no reason
Now all I do is try poke holes in stories. See who's lying or not and if something don't make sense done
I don't trust bitches either do you know how many times I've been lied to about shit
I wish I could go back and change shit I did. Didn't fuck with the wrong people
Including family. And you think I trust niggas?
I think I can only count 3-5 people throughout my whole life that hasn't been chatting shit behind my back or betrayed my trust
I'm gonna Twitter vent until this phone dies fuck this
Once this phone dies that's it until Friday
So why?
I know no one got me like her
Should I sleep or do work?


I'm up in the woods
Like for real though?
Guess I ain't getting any nudes
@MinieSqueeze 
That's the realist <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Tap my cell and a phone in the basement

All came from nothing, turn it into something
Girl you don't love me you just love doggy style, put this dick up in your mouth like what you talking bout, cos you've been talking
I usually don't do this but lemme go keep the party going
Don't wear your thing tonight
It's just me, Hennessy and you
Let's keep on sipping
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Working all winter just to fuck the summer up

Thank God for the first nigga to start rapping

You've been on my mind
I don't feel right
Jhene

I don't give a fuck
Your wondering how to get in the game I'm tryna get to the rafters
...the pussy mad wet and you got spit  
Lit for your love
Be quiet I'm doing a toast

@Thirty_30_12 new EP from him
@Thirty_30_12 i need to listen to it now. Just got onto PND-Ferina though
That's me tryna spell the noise that Kendrick does on the All Day remix
Swishzzzzz swishzzzzz
All day hoe
MGS - OTS
I need to find out who's on that sample
But even though you've hurt me
Life is a stage I just play my part
Game of charades, masquerades for the doe
I'll rather get to heaven with coke, that to live in hell and be broke
The sample on Kenny Lofton <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèæ
Cut the grass and the snakes will show, your neighbours fertiliser might be fake
The grass is always greener on the other side, always searching for another high
Then I got lazy and started to want to kick back, my 6 pack reverted to a gut
I've missed this Luda
Left these hoes and settled down with one chick, settled down with one chick started missing them groupies <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Ima big belly rudeboy they rub my belly
Dumb statement but my logic is right
I really think it's cos my headphones ain't loud enough. I don't flex enough anymore
When did all this negative shit kick in. Before I was always able to keep smiling
@Light_W8 just gasses everything
Terrible rapper
Great flexer

Eternal Sunshine

@BelEspritx lool alright
@BelEspritx you don't think so?
Or if she's an actor 
For that paper all the wrong things sound right
Keys open doors but bricks open windows
My acting days are over fuck them niggas for life
Every time I see them something wrong with their memory
@_yolandaalee I've been tryna find time to listen. Is it worth it?
I need more people on snapchat
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Bucket after bucket when it's done I say fuck it I'll replace it with another one
Beach is better
Suck my dick like a fat chick
Always been money over bitches but she got that million dollar pussy
It just feels nice
Sometimes you just have to get your dick out
Ah I keep forgetting
I just really hope that you think of me
I like face timing too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
