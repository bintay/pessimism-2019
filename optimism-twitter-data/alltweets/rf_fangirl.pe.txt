@ayeshA_Nausheen meine yeh sab TV pe nhi dekha tha na islye mujhe idea nhi :// 
I guess they planned it after show's  success
@loveashvikxo oh it's completely alright.I don't have any issues. Was just stating my own standing :-) 
I'm 25 lol
@ayeshA_Nausheen itni toh nahi but shows are still as interesting. Agay ki stories ke characters mein bhi charm hai :-)
@loveashvikxo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Makes me paranoid about kids around me. That's some serious stuff for my old school mind :P
My bro can never understand why I love my Pakistani shows so much. He's now given up on trying to show me all these famous Angrezi shows lol
Giving into Baa Bahu and Baby. . . Everybody watches it on 7 pm daily. 
Acha hai. 
The best thing is everyone sticks to their characters.
@ayeshA_Nausheen ho jaogi! Vasay had wanted to continue I read but things didn't work out. Makes me sad :(
I'm not undermining intelligence of teens but seeing these 14/15 yo kids 'drooling' on celebs makes me paranoid about social media. pliss
I like Moomal Sheikh. Soft spoken and pleasant! #MiratulUroos
@sabtau @nikitaloveu @HASNAAmoon @sheetaly @Reema_dsouza123 oh wow. Great :-)
Thanks for sharing

@vasaych hahaha message! 
 you have a selfie!? with whome ? :O
@FanGurling_Away you have a valid point! :)
@ushanigam2000 @FanGurling_Away writer is a guy. Khalil played the writer. .. ..
@FanGurling_Away @ushanigam2000 @TheMahiraKhan pretty much everyone did it for her or some for writer!
@FanGurling_Away happened in those times lol 
That's so not for my understanding
@FanGurling_Away looks apart. The kind of depth their love had at that age woah. I can't wrap my head around that. I tried. May be it
@FanGurling_Away and Khalil also a teen. I gave up on going back and solve the mysteries.
@FanGurling_Away ofcourse having MK raised expectations but direction was leading no where. I found out in last epis only Shano was 15 -_-
@ushanigam2000 @FanGurling_Away able to crack it for you :/ 
It was very complicated.
@ushanigam2000 @FanGurling_Away  I was so frustrated by script I did not even bother to clarify. If I followed it closely I might had been
@FanGurling_Away midway it became more of Shano ki mum's story. I watched it on and off :P 
Apparently shano died of a heart break lol
@ayeshA_Nausheen 
Dekho bhai larrka cute toh hai.

@FanGurling_Away tbh he looks content with what is he doing and choices. Watched some IVs. So I thought of sticking to liking IPK only <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ayeshA_Nausheen woh aur Laila trained actors hain :-)
Woh dance bhi acha karti hai aur you like the song? Mujhe sare seasons ke pasand hain
@FanGurling_Away exactly . 
And like you said people just move on.
@FanGurling_Away and ofcourse he should take a second chance. But honestly I don't quite see how he can make place in big BW. . ..
@FanGurling_Away I don't really blame him. He's quite right about content on TV. But he has to make a choice. .. ..
@FanGurling_Away 22 yards shelved or halted. Apparently SKSH completed its shoot part. Post prod was left and that's also delayed.. .
@FanGurling_Away exactly! And no hopes in future either. .. ..
@FanGurling_Away kahan dekhi? Online hai?
@FanGurling_Away very offsetting for me personally. And fans rushed him with how awesome is he looking lolll 
Haven't watched MAMR.

I didn't know you were KSG fan, barun aur Ksg donu? :p :O
@ayeshA_Nausheen yeh ek peranay zamanay ka show tha. Sitcom tha. ustime Jawad boht newly popular tha :P bachpan ki yaad :P
What's the point of showing that 9,10 years kid as maid in #Alvida ? 
#humTV
These Jubilee Insurance ads featuring Nauman Ijaz and Fahad Mustafa are so so beautiful #Alhabib #Apna
Sanam Jung is looking stunning in #Alvida on her Mehendi #HumTV #ImranAbbas

@crazy4fawad you notice now SRK hasn't had any song in his voice recently altho his voice suits him a lot . Srk stopped it
@crazy4fawad something like he became famous with my songs only. Nothing on his credit and he doesn't acknowledge me enough etc
@crazy4fawad lol he does this all the time. Don't you know of his spat with SRK?
I also used to like him a lot as singer before that lol
@crazy4fawad this guy is prolly high all the time. Realized seeing his comments about Atif Aslam &amp; Pakistani artists. He's Very insensitive

@ayeshA_Nausheen hahahaha 3no aik hi hain :P Nausheen Masood. Search kia hai :P
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 yes also they prolly put either Prineeti or some new girl in every movie no?

@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad I wish they would officially announce mr Chaalu. I'll be excited! 
L
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 I don't think Fawad even has space for 3 movies deal lolll 
Kitni sign karega
@ayeshA_Nausheen han yaad aa gya yehi thi Maria :))
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad is it? I thought they refuse to comment if so. 
What do you girls think anyway about the deal?

@iPriyankaRaghu woah so meaningful. How come you thought of sharing it achanak se? :-)
@ayeshA_Nausheen poppy toh pakki hai. Maria toh DeDil wali hai Sanam ki friend. .. 
Nahi? :P
Production house i.e.YRF denied the rumor of deal w Fawad Khan yet these newssites are propagating it.
His name sells so much these days? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ayeshA_Nausheen tumne Behadd main dekhi hogi woh Fawad ki sister :P
@HalwaingAway am watching Alvida and Ded but half heartedly just for cast :// 
Kuch dhondo yar :/
And I was watching the show to see the extension of those scenes between Sanam and Mikaal #DiyarEDil
That heart breaking moment when you realize what happens in OST of #DiyarEDil between Sanam Saeed and Mikaal Zulfiqar stays in OST only.
But it's justified given the content on Tv these days. Koi acha show lagao please :'(
Missing a TV show syndrome Lol

@Shreya22S I'm good. Thanks. Nothing special, just enjoying my break :)) 
What's up at your end?
@OnlyFawad umm nothing very special apart from that he's in Lahore and a photoshoot may release soon. Also he shot for pepsi ad in Bangkok

@Shreya22S I get it no problem :-) 
It's same on this side of border too. No biggie
@Shreya22S eat it. It's just an explanation for you to understand the dynamics :-) not to hurt you lol :-)
@Shreya22S yeah in Pakistan most ppl don't even care/know about veg/non veg thing cos it's majority muslim country. And islam allows them to
@OnlyFawad no problem :-). Hope you're doing well.
@Shreya22S lol really appreciate this tweet :-) 
Its fine but to be mercurial is never a good option. Doesn't help ever :-)
@Shreya22S it's not misinterpretation. It's lack of coomunication between both countries. Well I interact w ppl to get closer not to offend
@Shreya22S cool it and undrstand why I tweeted to you lol 
To appreciate you. You always get hyper :-)
@Shreya22S thing and flag thing as far my knowledge worked
@Shreya22S yeah I did. That's why tweeted to you and untagged the person who I thought might not understand. Just wanted to clear beef
@Shreya22S normal condiments. Masalas don't contain any non veg element in itself
@Shreya22S it's a norm to mark your camp nothing big. 
Very sad to see hate mongering in young generation
@Shreya22S lol they didn't send beef. It's beef masala which is only condiments. Also I'm not fully aware of flag thing but in such missions
Thank God for no suits boots today at Samsung event for a change ;-))

But FK hi nhi bolta that's just too much introvert ness :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen woh toh pakka hai cos she loves Humsafar and dastaan. 
Lekin she can handle it better. Even Fawad speaks less but he was
@ayeshA_Nausheen that's true ;) 
She was very cold during launch morning show too when Fahad asked about it.

@ayeshA_Nausheen hahaha nhi woh shareef wala heart broken tha daddy aur society ke haathon :P
@ZeeZindagiTV like both but Sanam Saeed and Fawad Khan have an x factor in their chemistry. Love them so much together
@thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad aww have a quick day then it's weekend :-)) lil smthing 
@bhawanasomaaya @sanammodysaeed very true :-) evetytime I promise myself not to fangirl over them but one mention of them together &amp; am gone
@thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad and now already up and to work? Super woman much? ;-)
@ayeshA_Nausheen hyeee itna acha toh hai lol 
Shukar hai kuch different hai ;) tumne woh dekha Zaroon kashaf aur Ashar Khirad ka combined?
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu yes love doing so :))
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad that's very very true :-)) 
Thanks I'm good :D :)
@FanGurling_Away I guess it be a fawad break and Mahira show will be aired :) 
It's been long since they did so.
@thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu lmao perfect. And good day ladies! Very pleasant weather here :-))
@JazzKaurTweets @thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu hello :-))
@thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad Meg! You were awake all this time :O
@ishita_saxena13 true lekin shukar hai channel toh baki hai idher ka udher nhi hua lol 
Was a risky decision
@FanGurling_Away Id have believed that had they not shown its promos even before starting the channel :) 
It was a well thought out decision
@FanGurling_Away same thoughts. Always wondered why they bought it lol 
But glad now it's ending and channel is still running . .. ..
@Reema_dsouza123 ohh acha. Great! Mubarakaan
@ayeshA_Nausheen @Anjly___ yeh PakistanI toh ni song mere khyal main :O
@Anjly___ haha you should have done a jig along after that
@Reema_dsouza123 and for our breaths lol
Was hoping to get electricity before it finished. Didn't feel like opening laptop.
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 marnay maarne ko tyaar har waqt hum log iss issue ko. I'm repeating but I dislike it v much
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 it would be much easier if our culture was more accomdative of religious debates lol
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 we blindly follow (can be right or wrong both) something from childhood.
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 that's most amazing thing. Helps understanding what we believe or practice cos usually
@Anjly___ love the beats haha
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 every parents say this haha 
Fav lines of them :P
Mawra Hocane and Faisal Qureshi's tweet exchange about their show 'Maryam' :O 
Drama sites ki chaandi, Now present it as a fight lol
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 agreed. But they get worried to hear some things . .. ..
So all in all not a very good idea imo
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu yeah when they tried to show Bano was wrong in her resistance to Basant Singh. That outraged all being women
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 yeah that's what they feel that I might have weak faith which will not last if tested lol
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad I hope so too. .. .. .. 
They did some voice overs on bano which offended even Indian women
@crazy4fawad hi 5 ;)) and your dp is sooo good
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad yep get it just don't want then to point blank prove creation of Pak wrong lol 
That'd be too much
@crazy4fawad I see  :/ 
Also many complaints about 'so called regressive' stuff.
@Reema_dsouza123 yehi hota hai sometime you get your mind to accept you're getting off track but inside beliefs are hardest to keep firm
@crazy4fawad oh I'm pretty cool with my beliefs but strongly against our culture. And I too better keep mum on it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@crazy4fawad  kia hua? They getting criticism for airing it /o\
@Reema_dsouza123 being parents they keep asking me to read something or other for everything lol
@Reema_dsouza123 I get it but when I say what sins I might have done to deserve all this they feel I don't have faith to ask God sincerely
@crazy4fawad my dad doesn't get angry instead worried that I might have lost track of things  lol 
Mum doesn't like it though :P
@crazy4fawad som tum sach main crazy for Fawad ho ;-)) 
Doing justice to your name
@bushra_amina what you expect me to say lolll. However I do think pak has never been taken care of after so many sacrifices.
@Reema_dsouza123 it's meant to entertain and it entertained you. Paisa vasool. Jo kabhi laga hi nhi tha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
#PRT yeh kia caption dia hai Hello ne Fawad Khan ke lye <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ayeshA_Nausheen nhi yar phir bhi variety dikhao mujhe <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Raising (even genuine) queries about faith and beliefs in front of parents is a bad bad idea lol
@maria_ali25 I'm waiting for tomo epi to finally register my complaint to channel and Haissam Hussain. 
May be they don't show what I dread
@ayeshA_Nausheen but yar she ain't versatile iykwim <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ayeshA_Nausheen nhiii dekha yar. Uper se Sanam ne bola script achi nhi thi bilkul hi put off ho gai main ://
@sidraasays my concern too :) but I'm positive it'll be alright
@bushra_amina they are leading to prove pak creation was wrong lol 
It may be pov of India but it will hurt pak sentiments ://
@aleenaazhar1 agreed.
@maria_ali25 exactly It's more about failure of our ppl in taking care of it and a lesson we shouldn't be careless. Preserve our values &amp;all
@ayeshA_Nausheen main toh as a gesture of good will tumhe offer bhi maar rahi thi :P neighbors rights you know ;-))
@sidraasays yes and it's good I think as Kapoor sis are his friends. He Will be bit relaxed as Sadaf is expecting too.
Proud To Be A Pakistani. Going Through Crisis Ourselves, We Didn't Step Back! 
@ayeshA_Nausheen doosri biwi hona qubool hai? You know what I mean <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@ayeshA_Nausheen <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>hahahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@aleenaazhar1 I don't see it as indo pak war. I'm just waiting for finale episode to see what voice overs do
@bhavi_ksg_fk I can understand the sensitivity but I'm waiting for tomo s epi. It will be hurtful if they tried to prove Pak creation wrong
@Meenal_Says @realsanamjung @ImranAbbas me tooo like them together but this ID of SJ is probably fake.
@Reema_dsouza123 abhi toh nhi lagta end ho but will let you know :))
I can see zindagi voice overs manipulating the end of Dastaan. It's very sad to see that. 
#FawadKhan #SanamBaloch
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad you said it! 
And they photoshop him too much. Softness khaa letay hain
Now onto #Alvida #HumTV and mashaAllah the super innocent Hadi. Curious how story unfolds. So far so speedy.

Where have you been? Not seeing you much
@ayeshA_Nausheen tumhe baad main dm karon gi
@iPriyankaRaghu @EbnatAnika pri kia hua hai?
Never heard anything direct or ground breaking from his FCs. Usually it's what's already up on internet <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
#FawadAfzalKhan ji
High time Hassan Khalid joined Twitter as Fawad Khan's manager/Team. That might help lol
TBH FK isn't kind who updates things to random FCs
@iPriyankaRaghu @EbnatAnika also just ignore and block who is rude to you :))
@iPriyankaRaghu @EbnatAnika pri no idea about who and who and what's happening :). I saw Somz tweet and completely agree to that RT part :)
@ayeshA_Nausheen India they have started to suddenly admire her and ZGH lol 
Also changed their statements about His wife
@ayeshA_Nausheen lol kuch logon ko famous honay ka shoq hota hai boht :p same ppl used to call SS properly ugly and since zgh fame in
@25_shanz I could always see this ;) never followed any of his FCs. Alsohad arguments with Sanam Saeed ka FC. Mature ppl ought to be at helm
@ayeshA_Nausheen *no comnents* :P 
I know some log from way long. Well. ...
@EbnatAnika haha yar it was bound to happen :P well never mind ;-)
@25_shanz well id just say proof that our boy is getting famous day by day ;-)) 
Comes with that Lol

@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 loool you said it and I agreed in advance  ;-)
@ImFariaAfrin @EbnatAnika yes! Aur am sure Fawad ki pics bhi mila karen gi sonam ki account se ;-)
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad mujhe bhi hassi aa rhi hai but tbvh I agree with Somz :P


@Reema_dsouza123 and Director is same khoobsurat wala :// 
And he adapted the screenplay too .. .. ..
@ImFariaAfrin mine too easily :))
@Reema_dsouza123 LOL! Laughing so hard at phrasing of your words
@latchingonto you will if you are too occupied :))
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @karanjohar  woah that's news that Fawad will have similar look for 2 projects. He usually avoids that
@sheetaly @_fawadakhan_ @karanjohar yes he does have those long hair on ears in pics with you :))
@Reema_dsouza123 nopes and neither am doing that anytime soon. Have never liked filming of books. May be psychological problem
@EbnatAnika lool these girls very strongly believe in social media
@Reema_dsouza123 you're right.  cos usually Sonam ki acting umm never mind :P
Haha I don't know if Like Fawad Sonam chemistry more or the fact Fawad is open in her company and we get to see him laughing away <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Fawad is probably at Kapoor's place <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Kapoor girls always make him tweet and I love that ;-))
@_fawadakhan_ and I really love you and @sonamakapoor together. I'm positive this time you two will have greater and deeper chemistry :))
@_fawadakhan_ all the very best Fawad. Forever supportive of whatever you have done from khuda ke lye to TV shows to khoobsurat :)) love you

@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad I like the 'may be' ;)
@latchingonto be busy and wont have enough  time for it anyway. 
I enjoy your tweets
@latchingonto lolll id say just continue till you can if its not giving you negativity or taking up your time. Because eventually you will
@Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu evolved from not good to reformed guys. In MSKS he was good guy. Oh also Mirat ul uroos he evolved
@Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu  he was joking about his bad acting in sheher e zaat lol 
But yeah in Durre Sheh and Sheher his charact
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway shukk main he had thoday short hair :P I'm so watching it today. And Hir Yes I watched last epis and looved
@latchingonto whaaat why? All well?
@crazy4fawad tbh me too ;)
And Reem three lol
@HalwaingAway completely agree. Eww fanatics lagtay hain woh fans se ziada :X
@crazy4fawad lol I was thinking the same. Aur ab toh shooting bhi kur rha hai don't think he will grace twitter very often
@crazy4fawad so so so so true! And apparently some other fandoms are sooo pissed lol
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 pri did you get Umera Ahmad jokes? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 on small jokes. Wese thodi depression/problem hoti hai duniya main so love comedy A LOT
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 lol that's why I am hopeful about it the most from you haha 
Wese I like to enjoy humor so I laugh a lot even
@crazy4fawad exactly what I thought :)
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 you must if you ask me :P but Pri's response was just okay so our tastes can differ. Remember lol
@crazy4fawad oh I saw promo on zindagi channel thought it was going to be just launched. It's local superhero type animated stuff
@Reema_dsouza123 omg so happy and it makes me even happier when you says bhai enjoyed it too 
I know it's hard to get guys approvals lol
Burka avenger coming on some Zee channel as well. But not on Zindagi, some ZQ channel. Heard it was pretty good
@HalwaingAway Lol hate IF the most in all kinda fan sites. No tolerance there for anyone. Very repulsive
@wajeeha_SaRun @shambhavi_Roy haha Thank you :p

@sus_nancho yeah I realized how stupid my question was. Praying for you all constantly. May God keep you in his protection. Dua &amp; love
@latchingonto @FariaSays I thought you were busy with your exams and stuff. .. ..
Ikr it can give so much negativity. .. ..
@OnlyFawad @crazy4fawad hahaha I know right he's getting popular and famous :p but I'm confident I'll get him ;)
@Reema_dsouza123 haha Reem woh Rabia ki mom ki sister hai rabia ki mom nhi :P 
And you watched it complete?
@abbasimj thanks :))
@Reema_dsouza123 @aleenaazhar1 looking ones in our eyes. I guess it applies to Virat too
@Reema_dsouza123 @aleenaazhar1 yes. And we don't necessarily love good looking ppl but when we love someone they defo become most good
@thisandthat81 hehe i was just being lame and yeah you're damn right about latter!
@Reema_dsouza123 or rather khoobsurat! :))
@Reema_dsouza123 Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha obliged ;))
@aleenaazhar1 @Reema_dsouza123 agree but I guess shakal doesn't matter too much in desirability :))

@Reema_dsouza123 lol really! 
But the guys I mentioned also have Huge rather established following. Also Shahid Kapoor!
@Reema_dsouza123 I guess so. Isn't it such a dabbang entry?
polls rigged? :O xD
That's huge in presence of youth superstars like Varun, Sidharth, Ranveer etc Considering Fawad Khan is new to bollywood
So basically Fawad khan occupies the 3rd position right behind Hrithik Roshan in times poll. And first one is fixed with FORVER DESIRABLES?
@FariaSays agreed she always tries to be bright ! Haha 
But now she has impoved a lot
@FariaSays kia hua? Lol you don't like SQ?
@FariaSays village girl or urban role but she can work on her acting for sure. Very few in her competition currently
@FariaSays I'm talking in general :) 
Personally I feel Mahira has the most potential in terms of  looks  to pull off any role be it
@FariaSays looked incomplete and too simple for my liking. Saba Qamar looked nice and forgot it I like SQ as an actor too :)
@FariaSays oh :( I just liked her Sari. Others didn't suit her body type. I was disappointed in everyone. Mk looked stunning but her dress
@FariaSays that's just understandable. Nothing surprising. She's probably the most famous female lead actress right now. Ppl love her :)
@FariaSays so you ain't as blind a fan ;))
@FariaSays @latchingonto jahan Mahira wahan Sana <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FariaSays hahahaha acha. No idea I should thank or what lol 
How did you like Mahira's dress for Hum awards?
@NishATQaseem chalo kabhi apki place pe khaa lain gey. Someday may be ))
@FariaSays haha upto you. I don't bother follows or follow backs
I follow everyone until I find their tweets intersting and nice lol
@FariaSays tamee? 
I don't take fandoms much on heart if I have nice convos with people. I'm cool just don't wanna hurt fans nazuk dils :)
@FariaSays @TheMahiraKhan umm well let's continue as long as we can lol 
Unfollow before abusing me though haha 
Hate abuses.
@FariaSays @TheMahiraKhan I think only crazy MK fan I have gotten well all along is Sana lol 
We even discuss but hardly harsh arguements
@FariaSays @TheMahiraKhan let's split right away amicably then <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FariaSays all I know is our TV is so empty these days. Nothing really good as everyone is busy in movies now
@FariaSays @TheMahiraKhan lol that's crazy! Haha
@FariaSays she said she's doing them but it gets hectic to manage with morning show. But I don't see any promos anywhere ://
@FariaSays although I'm not anti her at all lol but can never be a blind fan. Not for even my absolute favs like Fawad and Sanams
@FariaSays lmao I keep tweeting that MK fans please don't follow me. They get offended fairly easily. Have experienced on all forums lol
@FariaSays Ahsan boht fluctuate karta hai acting mein but overall a decent actor. Rubab is okay. Not dominating for me like SS SB and MK
@FariaSays my liking for her goes back to her VJ days. That's why have a softer corner for her
@FariaSays I can see that. I don't like MKs acting. I feel her acting is like what you feel about Sanam lol
But she has good presence also
@ayeshA_Nausheen same
@FariaSays lol not same acting but same roles imo
@FariaSays sanam saeed <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And Sanam Baloch too. 
Actors kafi. Fawad &amp; Adeel top the list.
@FariaSays I am watching Zid. Maya is good but Im not really her fan yet. It's like she's nice and all
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 haha cooool! He's true love of my fan girl life. Too much on my plate <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FariaSays work so far. It's cool we can agree to disagree lol
@FariaSays haha I agreed on Mikaal part but still don't agree on Sanam part. However she repeats herself a lot. So not much variety in her
@crazy4fawad #HappyTears  @Reema_dsouza123 check it! 
But you have to watch his YT videos too whenever you have loads of free time!
@FariaSays and not a fan of Maya Ali too :P so basically we disagree :p
@FariaSays haha I meant SS is good actress and Mikal is director's actor. If director is good he will act really well. And I dont like OKB
@rogerfederer RF contemplating his Turkish look #CaptionRF
@FariaSays loool we disagree on everything in this tweet.
@rogerfederer RF getting ready for new AVI update on twitter since it's been a month #CaptionRF

@FariaSays I'm not really enjoying DeD too so just apprehensive but will watch it soon :)
@crazy4fawad @Renu_258 haha FK ka bhoot is good bhoot :)) it's sawar on me too lol 
That's not even comparable.
@FariaSays okay it's on my list but I usually don't like Farhat's novel ki dramatization ://
@FariaSays @fahadmustafa26 whose the writer?
@FariaSays heard a lot about it but haven't watched it. SJ and Adnan Sid wala na?
@crazy4fawad @Renu_258 ohh awkward :P okay get off twitter before they scandalize you Lol
@Renu_258 @crazy4fawad som ab maan bhi jao ;-)
Renu I love Adeel so I kinda end up liking him mostly in all characters
@FariaSays main ne dekha nhi theek se. Ghussa itna ata hai :(
Aur Aarzu was so good in kankar. Yahan pta nhi kesi. Hate titlescreen of show!
@FariaSays @FarooqHareem is it her first show? Im sorry for bad knowledge as I just restarted watching TV
@crazy4fawad @Renu_258 looool poor  Som ;)
@FariaSays how much this dusri biwi track puts me off! No idea why our leading actors are doing such stuff ://
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 it is! :)
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 Hahahahahaa Pri you're very smart :p

I'm happy to have Adeel all to myself
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 haha yeah baqi sabko relaxation hai :) FK ke charm se inkaar nhi but I love Vasay too so lil biased lol
@sheetaly @_fawadakhan_ sure thing ;)
@ayeshA_Nausheen don't worry will do ;) 
Zra quake wala stress thoda kam ho lay. I'll spam!
@crazy4fawad may be like that soft corner you have for Fahad Mustafa I have that for Adeel Husain lol
@crazy4fawad no need to sorry lol 
FK is FK. Undisputed king :) 
I like him more in JH :) 
And I do find him very charming ;)
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 oh okay. May be our sense of humors differ lol 
I love it :)
@sheetaly @_fawadakhan_ no idea what went on but one thing is for sure FK would have liked to stay low profile lol 
He is like that
@Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu hu hu
THAT IS GREAT! 
Then you're allowed :)) love both.
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 hehe Pri main Reem ko kabse bol rahi hon that's why! :P

#StayStrongNepal <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>🏼 
@OnlyFawad I thought about it but then dropped it as others are more vocal :))
@Reema_dsouza123 watching that right now. Imagine Hassan ki mental condition
@ShahidSrfraz I don't like the name too <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

No self respect
@ayeshA_Nausheen mujhe bhi bta dena :P sharam ka muqam
@ZeeZindagiTV Fawad Khan in acting  above anyone and everyone. Then Adeel Hussain is soo soo charming and a brilliant actor as well :)

@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen where did you get itni detail! Will have to check the director and writer now. .. ..

@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen yeh na aye saray baday log ab choti screen par anytime soon :/ :/
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway sister I would love that sister but you know sister I'm elder sister so pliss move aside Adeel here I come ;)
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway blame my ZGH fan inside, khushfehmi reminds me of Zaroon's acha ab khushfehmi bhi na rakhoon main? ;)
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen Fawad pe sab ka wese hi equal haq hai; sadaf ka bus ziada ;-))
@NishATQaseem haha and Nish I rem mujhe Bano novel bano parrhna hai :P don't think I have forgotten

MashaAllah Mehwish Hayat in another item song? #KarachiSeLahore
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen hehe no doubt she's a good actress :) but haven't wstched this show :P
@Reema_dsouza123 yes wohi wala! :) she mentioned it just thoda sa.
@Reema_dsouza123 hehe even my mum agrees ;)

@Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu I seem to agree vociferously ;-))
@Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu still a better blame than blaming weighing scale D: 
Ive put on 5 extra kilos
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway so zindagi is airing Rihai aka pyar ka haq at 8:00 pm. .. .. 
MEJ got 9 pm slot
@Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu  Lol Reem! ! That sure is an exaggeration to motivate yourself .....
No idea Where are our morning and game shows heading to. Common People making appearances to insult themselves rather proudly #Sick
This begum Farida Shabbir Jaan is so nasty and rude. Sad to see Sanam Jung falling prey to trend of morning shows #HumTV #JagoPakistanJago

It's much easier to judge once you have more information.
@OnlyFawad woah so kind Neha &lt;3
I'm glad and yes to be honest I try to share whatever I have learned myself through crises or experience :)
@Renu_258 hehe abhi yeh dekh lo jo shuru kye huay hain :))
But you can watch telefilm Armaan and abhi tau mein jawaan first :)
@crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu both pictures are so perfect :D morning all :))
@rogerfederer I love you! :)
@shambhavi_Roy sure <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@shambhavi_Roy yeah I am not letting him get married with anyone else, it's just him and me <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@ayeshA_Nausheen hahahahahhaha I only don't like when I feel sympathy for Sehrish :@ why oh why.
@ambika_acharya @shambhavi_Roy heheh you're famous <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>see
@Renu_258 always welcome! I love taking about our dramas lol 
sure jab dekhi toh btana kesi lagi :)
@shambhavi_Roy woah sweet of you to say that! and you guys keep watching them :) &lt;3
@OnlyFawad you have a beautiful daughter, hug her tight and listen to her sweet talks, Kids are such blessings :)
@OnlyFawad I have learnt only way to be able to come out is to talk to real people and distract your mind. Nothing else really helps :)
@OnlyFawad  Neha when your mind o heat is upset, it's the hardest phase, and almost impossible to concentrate in such case.
@shambhavi_Roy hahah lovely! :) wait are you the one who wrote a blog/post about meeting her?
@shambhavi_Roy lol I was purely joking, as in not letting him go away from me :) I truly wish he goes there and gets allthe love possible :)
@aleenaazhar1 @Anwaya_Tweets yes I live in Punjab :)
@Renu_258 but that doesn't have Fawad in it :) it's still a wonderful watch.
@Renu_258 hahahha that's very sweet to say that :) yeah telefilm, old one. Aur doosri bhi telefilm hai, "abhi tau mein jawaan hoon" comedy
@aleenaazhar1 @Anwaya_Tweets Agree Aleena, religion is misused big time
@ayeshA_Nausheen aur how silly was that gaud bharai wala track <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I mean all those fake vomits and trying hard
@ayeshA_Nausheen Rumi toh meri jaan hai! how cute and how good an actor was this kid! &lt;3 &lt;3 
okay bus theek hai watching these epis :P
@Renu_258 @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu @thisandthat81 Aaj kuch na kaho is Fawad's telefilm, but other one is not :)
@shambhavi_Roy woah that's cool! you met her during zindagi'scompetition?
no no not letting Adeel off so easily 8)
@crazy4fawad @Renu_258 don't even have words. . .. .. ..
@Anwaya_Tweets @aleenaazhar1 completely agree!
@OnlyFawad @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @Renu_258 breather in such cases, can't be fine otherwise
@OnlyFawad @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @Renu_258 i am not being heartless but honestly keeping away from such news is the biggest
@shambhavi_Roy no he is single yet but I am trying to make him not-single ;) so yeah
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @Renu_258 same for me too! I can't see kids suffering even from poverty :( what's their fault? innocent souls
@aleenaazhar1 @Anwaya_Tweets feel belief in heart also matters :) my1hindu frnd converted to Christianity bcs reading bible solved her probs
@ayeshA_Nausheen Fawad ke shows ke baad sab se ziada pasand hai :P 
Yeh hurt wala, foot pe chot lagti hai jo? Epi number yaad hai?
@ayeshA_Nausheen agree! but those stupid talks between Sania and Sehrish ruin the show so so much. And like I told you mujhe unka romance
@shambhavi_Roy @aaminasheikh I see, hope they air other shows which I mentioned :) He's too good at comedy :)
@Anwaya_Tweets experience other religions, I always found it odd how BW stars go to all types of prayer places, Then finally I understood
@Anwaya_Tweets i actually went to a church and a big hindu temple to observe it closely :) there I realized it's such a strong feeling to
@Reema_dsouza123 My mum literally couldn't sleep during this Peshawar school incident and 2005 earthquake @crazy4fawad @Renu_258
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @Renu_258 Reem you're a mum! can't even imagine how hard it must be for you to see suffering like these
@crazy4fawad @Renu_258 untagged Pri, same! I didn't even follow the news and videos of Peshawar school massacre. Get too shaken.
@ayeshA_Nausheen han toh isn't it? she realizes that Sham isn't with her despite being there physically.I thought that's what they showed :P
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Renu_258 I can understand! that's why I have been off mostly. Night Pri x
Just pray, don't overthink on it
@crazy4fawad @Renu_258 @iPriyankaRaghu agreed about cost of life and this tweet both! fully
@Anwaya_Tweets you can practice the postures of Namaz from Youtube tutorials if you feel like :) I also used to find church very fasinating
@ayeshA_Nausheen han zaroor :P lekin detail na yad hui tau maaf kar dena :P
@Renu_258 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu doing the same. May God make it easy for them. .. Natural calamities are ruthless. .
@shambhavi_Roy @aaminasheikh yeah he occasionally does, Liked him in Armaan and Ainee ki baraat the most, decent in Silvatain aka Shikkan :)
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu causing MAJOR havoc, and death toll was in 'lacs' :/ thank God death toll is not that high in Nepal or Ind
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu this looks so so similar with our disaster but in this case main area hit is Nepal, in Pakistan it was within P
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu Can relate a lot so praying hard for all :)
@crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu I know right, same happened with Pakistan in 2005, these aftershocks are psychologically so disturbing.
@ayeshA_Nausheen show main, Aur aik aur jagah bhi abhi isi month, Prog Name: Subah e Pakistan :)

Imran Abbas bhi aya tha Avida ki launch main show main, Sanam Jung ke morning

@dycrony  just realized. Good to hear your fam is fine. Heart goes out to affected families.  #PrayingForNepal
@sheetaly hehe who knows better than you han ? :')
@sheetaly away from home. He was healthier when he started khoobsurat promotions in july  but sooo lean when he went back home. ....
@sheetaly yehi toh bol rahi hon ke kal aya aur aj kaam bhi shuruh. I really hope he takes good care of himself. He loses weight in India :/

@Reema_dsouza123 omg so so so agree
@Reema_dsouza123 I am so surprised ya :/ how easily now drugs are available is alarming. .. . .
The number of druggies I know myself is frustrating to say the least. Bachon ko ghar rakho toh net addiction, baher bhejo toh drug addiction
@Reema_dsouza123 agreed. but I wrote if off completely in first watch. But after you said you liked it I'm watching again and liking it
@Reema_dsouza123 mohabbat subah ka sitara hai. ..
@Reema_dsouza123 I abandoned watching it. watched only Adeel's parts lol 
It's actually a decent show
@Reema_dsouza123 I am watching MSKS again and liking it this time, now I get it you kinda liked it. First time I was so put off by acting
@ayeshA_Nausheen Adeel is so good with kids but this bachi is so unresponsive, miniature Romaisa :'( still he managed well
@Gurpreet483kaur yes, although it's great that lives are saved but financial losses are very hard to make up for too.
@dubey_ruchika @mitrmyfrnd great that all is well.
@Reema_dsouza123 it's so frustrating to just see that. God help all
@Reema_dsouza123 Yeah reems looks like it's all good in Pakistan and even India, but worried for Nepal, as I have seen the havoc first hand
@ayeshA_Nausheen nahi sirf woh nahi Adeel haina shuru main apne taveez ke saath :P usko dekhoon gi dil bhar ke <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Gurpreet483kaur yes looks like it. But am worried for Nepal the most, it takes years to rebuild and lives lost are irreplaceable :(

@sheetaly Hairaan kis baat par hua? :O ke India se gift bheja tha? 
I think sometimes he's too humble and underestimates his fans :P
@sheetaly woah, he remembered the gifts? Aur iss dafa kia dia usko gift main? :)
@sheetaly cos my friend met him and said he's really really lean in real life, but that was in 2014 ka start.
@sheetaly and you recognized him too! it's even sweeeter! because seeing real life celebs it can be tricky :) has  he gained weight?
@sheetaly sweet! I am really really happy for you! you really love him :) I still rem how much effort you put into his bday message :)
@iPriyankaRaghu @ayeshA_Nausheen no swaymwar, only wedding and you are invited Pri :P baki log nahi invited, woh stay away :P

@soniafarar don't rem if I liked anyone :/ 
Now Sabaz pics look like she was one of the best
@soniafarar that's actually true!
@soniafarar can't believe that Ayesha Omar failed it too. Never ever disliked her dress ever before. Sab weird lag rahay thay
@soniafarar the fun of tv telecast on that day :) didn't even watch Fawads videos in whole
@soniafarar she's looking gorgeous too. I didn't like dresses of most actresses on that night. Aand I'm avoiding watching videos itll spoil
@bhavi_ksg_fk @Humtvnetwork grr must be in may mid or end cos if it was in start they'd be airing promos already. Nooo :'(
Hum Tv should air Award show already. Even No promos yet #HumAwards2015 @Humtvnetwork
And Saba Qamar looks so so gorgeous while receiving her award on stage.  #HumAwards2015 #photos!
This Nadeem F Paracha seems to be negatively obsessed with Fawad Khan and Mahira Khan<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@sheetaly I can understand :) take your time to settle and answer everyone, then I'll bombard you with questions about feels &amp;experience :)
@Hir_Jalebi woah loved the spam ;) Spamming &lt;3 &lt;3
@TheMahiraKhan @iamsrk such a sweet tweet, your nervousness is understandable and so is Kindness &lt;3
@Hir_Jalebi LOVE how you always open heartedly acknowledge his acting, pairs with co stars and grace his pics on your profile :)

This made me cry :'( 

Why so painful?

#Dast…
@abbasimj @sheetaly @crazy4fawad it's a glucose monitoring device. I'm 95pc sure :)

Enjoy the moment :)
@ayeshA_Nausheen woh islye bhi acha ziada lag rha hai ke tie nhi lagai hui :P 
Full formal tiar ho jata hai warna :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway really? Mujhe moonch pasand nhi khaas generally but Mikaal ko suit karti hai xP
He can keep it :P
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen he's trying serious stuff it seems. Actors hate it when they are told to confine :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen woh pic ki caption dekhi urrti hui chummi wali! :p 
Main pagloon ki tarah has rahi hoon usko parrh parrh ke
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway same betis same. Osman I'm not fan of though :P watching for how Mikaal Sanam play oldies
@HalwaingAway still trying to know the motivation behind dramatizing it . ..
@HalwaingAway agree there. SJ is good here but her character was very annoying in first epis.
@crazy4fawad aur jo sab khawateen ka dil ley gai. Laughing ever since. Found the line really funny :P :P
@bhavi_ksg_fk @_fawadakhan_ its so beautiful :) tfs as usual
@thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad did you guys read the caption rofl

@HalwaingAway I'm watching it just for Sanam and Mikaal. Not much expectation. . 
Working okay for me. Nothing special as such. You?
@Reema_dsouza123 #HappyMoi!
These loving acts of Hassan towards Bano are so so heart rendering. Brilliant acting. #Dastaan #Fawadkhan #SanamBaloch
@ImmiHamna unhun ne yehi kehna hai. Ab PTI ka test hai woh kesay handle karti hai. Do express your concerns but Don't worry
@ImmiHamna Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha nhi yar leader kahay ki hum ne harna hi hai jo bhi karen toh party members ka moral kharab hta hai
@ImmiHamna I agree with second part pti seekhti nhi but what do you think na contest kartay election? :O 
Yar ab darr ke beth jayen?
@ImmiHamna larrna zruri hai warna experience kesay hoga? Aur rahi baat sure honay ki woh islye zruri hai ke spirit let down na ho workers ka
@ImmiHamna politics se interest hona achi baat hai but itna dil pe nhi lo. Khan saheb ko samjhana mushkil nhi namumkin hai. Cheer up
@ayeshA_Nausheen @sanammodysaeed I'm more excited for Bachana. She said its feel good cute movie. Mahe meer ka trailer saal se out hai :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen woh movies mostly non comnercial hoti hain :P 
Kuch fully commercial hona chahye Sanam ka about
@gupshup9 original PHs to have worked on saving them lol
@gupshup9 jeevan ki rahoon and satrungi had some good moments and were youth oriented might be they think of doing so but I don't trust
@shaivisingh ji settled. . 
Feels great, with family. . 
That's what I missed the most. Still in 'I just came back' mindset lol
@sanammodysaeed your movies in these coming days ? :) 
Haven't heard of any release date so far though
@sanammodysaeed hey Sanam. Just curious are you on a break from work? Cos haven't heard of any upcoming project or you'll be promoting
@gupshup9  I doubt they will air his old shows. . . . 
If they do it'll be great for us as atleast we'll get clear prints online lol

@OnlyFawad @Gurpreet483kaur you yourself are so pretty too! Have seen you :))
@OnlyFawad @Gurpreet483kaur I was tagged too Neha. I was telling Gurpreet that I knoww about AAnya already hehe
@ayeshA_Nausheen same! Achay bhalay drama ko tabah kia iss dragging ne. Uper se scenes itnay fazool thay woh Sania aur Seherish ke. Ghussa!
@Hir_Jalebi it just makes your heart sooo sooo sad. We will discuss once you finish it. Hopefully by then Id watched divergent too
#HassanBano #Dastaan <BLACK HEART SUIT>. 
@Hir_Jalebi @ushanigam2000 in pakistani format 4 epis but Zindagi will have one week I think. . .
@Hir_Jalebi yeah I have the link of that. Will dm you tomo.
@OnlyFawad @Gurpreet483kaur yeah I knowww! She's so prettyyy :)
@ayeshA_Nausheen it's the same with Fawad that you can not him despite being stupid as Ashar specially :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen and can't hate him either ;) see I love Jalebi Jamshed :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen I'm completely getting you and majburis and halaat were shown beautifully in shukk before it went heywire in middle epis.
@Hir_Jalebi I know ya. . 
Abhi last epi dekhna it's soooo heart breaking. Really painful
@ushanigam2000 @Hir_Jalebi its not a good idea to watch it daily. It has sad vibe in these episodes. Heart breaking.
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad night. Sleep well :)
#ArHi #TeriMeri #IPKKND <BLACK HEART SUIT>. 
@rf_fangirl <BLACK HEART SUIT>.

@aleenaazhar1 @ayeshA_Nausheen every girl is physically beautiful and has high end habits and liking lol 
Same for heroes
@aleenaazhar1 @ayeshA_Nausheen hahahahahahahahahaha nooo I ain't that negative or bitter but I am defo not a naazuk full of feel feminine :P
@aleenaazhar1 @ayeshA_Nausheen even her girls. . . . 
Too novel-ish 
Used to like novels at one point in time
@ayeshA_Nausheen sure ;)
@aleenaazhar1 @ayeshA_Nausheen haha I don't believe in Love shaid isilye mujhe khamkhawa ka romance pasand nhi aata lol
@ayeshA_Nausheen konsa tweet? Kur doon gi but hua kia?
@ayeshA_Nausheen mujhe dialogues se chirr hai :P tumhe toh pasand honay chahye kaafi mushy hain lool
@ayeshA_Nausheen completely with you on this! :)
@ayeshA_Nausheen mujhe idea tha :P
@aleenaazhar1 @Anwaya_Tweets @ayeshA_Nausheen bland lagtay hain. I don't really see intensity. .
@aleenaazhar1 @Anwaya_Tweets @ayeshA_Nausheen everyone sees it differently mujhe toh Sanam Mikaal kahen excellent aur kahen bilkul he
@ayeshA_Nausheen tumne dekha hi nhi hoga kyunki woh humsafar ki live transmission main tha :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen @aleenaazhar1 cos it was offered to Fawad and Mahira before. .
@ayeshA_Nausheen @aleenaazhar1 ayesha woh dekha jab Fawad said yeah Adeel husain kur rhay hain role woh theek hain uss role kyle :P
@Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad yayy som said the same, we don't connect for no reason . .
@ayeshA_Nausheen I think woh epi when they go drop Rumi school together!
@ayeshA_Nausheen ek jagah garri mein hotay hain woh, I think Ayesha ko pta lagnay ke baad us time jab woh reassure kara rha hota hai
@MaimoonaSherazi  unfortunately I don't use FB. Thanks though :))
@aleenaazhar1 @Anwaya_Tweets @ayeshA_Nausheen more than Adeel mujhe Sarwat unfit lagi for role. . 
I have read the novel :)
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 Lol that's a good advice . .. .. ..
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 about their understanding. . 
Its such a put off
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 you go onto make fun of it. .. .. .. 
I'm against 'Superiority complex' which fans have
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 tbh I'm myself against giving undue importance to celeb kids and spouses but that doesn't mean
@Me_Oxymoron @HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 don't think  its about being middle class. .. ..
@HalwaingAway @Me_Oxymoron @pchakraborty111 he was a relative too May be one reason. .
@ayeshA_Nausheen karti hai ke it's wrong! &lt;3 &lt;3 
Aur ek dafa Sanam kehti hai 'dobara Karen' when he says love you
@ayeshA_Nausheen haha aur mujhe woh bhi jab sanam call karti hai ratko Ayesha ghar nhi hoti phir suddenly realize
@Meenal_Says me too! Love their acting. Fawad never fails to leave an impression. Does he?
@Reema_dsouza123 @iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 haha pri came up with a tag line lol 
Geo beta
@OnlyFawad I'm talking in general.. .. ..
Ppl talk so seriously about him that it's so hurtful to see that. . 
We should just enjoy. .
@OnlyFawad heyy Neha how are you? Read your tweet about down phase of your life. Made a prayer. May you get the strength.. .. .. ..
@MaimoonaSherazi @Gurpreet483kaur very l versatile! Love her
@Anwaya_Tweets @ayeshA_Nausheen main bhi!
@Hir_Jalebi ohh you hadn't seen this before?? Actually there are few like this I thought you might had seen them. .

Food blogger :crispy fried bread with a dollop of butter and mashed potato…
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 other, it serves me right
@iPriyankaRaghu @crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 @thisandthat81 YOU SAID IT! that's why I stick to appreciating his shows more than anything
@Gurpreet483kaur and lastly ainee :) My most fav comedy shows :)
@Gurpreet483kaur Abhi tau mein Jawaan hoon is single 2 hrs telefilm! watch it any time :) others have order, First Azar, then Dolly, Takay
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 I do the same too! but now I have kinda stopped stalking these things.
@Gurpreet483kaur Ainee ki baraat and Azar ki baraat :) love her in both
@Gurpreet483kaur EASILYYY! do tell me your feed back when you watch it! :D
Baraat one has four seasons! :) dolly ki baraat, taakay ki baraat
@Gurpreet483kaur sure, these two shows I keep on tweeting about :P "abhi tau main jawaan hoon" telefilm of 2 hours and Dolly ki ayegi baraat
@Gurpreet483kaur she is fab in comic roles too, you gotta see to believe it! :) you will love her I am sure
@crazy4fawad @Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron kasam se itna blood boil hota tha!
@Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron asked security to keep fans away, may be he wasn't feeling well to interact. .. I somtime feel sorry for them
@Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron personalities too as long as they ain't rude :) so it works well for me, I don't see any problem even if he
@Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron they show how weak their personalities. and personally I am huge advocate of giving space to showbiz
@crazy4fawad it always puts me off, that's why I mentioned about staying away from gangs earlier too lol
@sheetaly yeah but woh uski itni achi acting ke baad :) warna toh pretty faces boht hain but itni engrossing acting kam ki hai
@Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron reason. It just makes you so negative. Just live by what you see &amp; think. No need to take others' judgements
@Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron you will be agitated more when you got there more, I have quit India forum and review sites for the same
Being assertive is such a repulsive trait to have. Why can't all of us be polite in our arguments <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>

@ayeshA_Nausheen woh jo hai na Shukk main scene jab Rumi se Adeel aur Sanam shadi ke aglay din 'Qubool hai" karatay hain, aur Subah Subah
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway But whatever I saw Adeel ka Taveez stood out :P and it's still in my mind. Adeel Adeel Adeel Adeel :P
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu can't handle the politics. I am happy like this only :P Free bird
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu oh woh ahan :P TBVH I deliberately stay away from all this THE FK gang
@Me_Oxymoron @HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 slight modification for me, Nobody *should* be like that but there are some out there :)
@Gurpreet483kaur @Me_Oxymoron they used to piss me off too initially, they do so with all actors 
more like Zoom TV of Pakistan internet ;)
@Gurpreet483kaur I like her a alot. She's so versatile :) you gotta watch her other shows to realize this.
@NishATQaseem aww nahi, thank you for concern! how are you doing? :)
@KirtyKochar yes :)
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway I hate you both :P I badly want to see it now :P I have missed these things due to SJ's acitng
@Anwaya_Tweets I haven't seen the show on Zindagi yet but they pass away in first or second episode of the show so make an approoximation :)
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu to do with writers selling something in name of FK ? lol
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu lol I at one point felt something but then shook it off. Does ti have something
@Anwaya_Tweets always welcome Anwaya <BLACK HEART SUIT>
are you liking the show?
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu I am so not getting it. But how come I didn't see anything if it's on twitter
 
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu Chitting hai yeh
@thisandthat81 @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @iPriyankaRaghu @Rydoshi whaaattt you know too! hahahaha what's up ladies :p
@pchakraborty111 @HalwaingAway oh this reminded me of more things I didn't like about it, "over hearing" in last episodes was annoying :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen Okay full marks for your presentmindedness :P <BLACK HEART SUIT><BLACK HEART SUIT>
@Anwaya_Tweets she has parents who die in initial episodes in an accident, and then her granny takes care of her till she passes away too. .
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @iPriyankaRaghu  ab toh you are getting us curious :P :O
@pchakraborty111 @HalwaingAway that's understandable for me, Gussay main who cares? but in dramatization of novel many things got lost
@HalwaingAway  hahaha there could be better ways lol she looks really young in some avatars like in some parts of bol &amp; bin Roye .. .
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 Kher jo hua so hua, It worked for everyone involved and local television industry :) great!
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 ahaha :P They could simply manipulate it someway, no? like Shano was apparently 15/16 in ST :O
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 craving to watch clip from the show despite everything so yeah it worked whatever it was :P
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 up with it or alternate justification, hence for me things weren't as perfect however I often get the
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 um all these things are best justified with the ages of the characters lol and director never really came up
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 his wife*  not her lmao
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 we can just run our imagination anywhere we want now :p
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 yeah but here Ashar simply appeared a stupid guy who doubted her wife even on laughs she shared with Khizar
@thisandthat81 agreed! you will defo get firmer in this belief once you watch it again! happens with me all the time
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 ahhahahhahahhahaha HIRAAALLL! ;)
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 this age of communication but then Fawad also said it's men's nature too to act like that lol
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 ever I have seen even Fawad &amp; Mahira felt that Ashar should have been approached by one way or other in
@HalwaingAway @pchakraborty111 Also the factor of Ashar's mother's involvement .. everyone's bound to trust their mums. . .Also from what

@rogerfederer @WilsonTennis you look great and looks like you had fun :) #HappyRFans!
@crazy4fawad I watched one in morning repeat cast and now my heart :( 
I'ts not a good idea for zindagi to telecast it daily. Too heavy
#MeriJaanHaiTu <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ayeshA_Nausheen @iPriyankaRaghu sorry I couldn't read it :P What did you just say <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@NishATQaseem aw nothing serious! just cramps and all as a result of exercise :)
@aleenaazhar1 @HaissamHussain true! missing him REALLY bad! and sincerely hope this soon comes soon :)
@chikoo_25 Got to read it and now he himself confirmed it too :)
@iPriyankaRaghu @Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad @thisandthat81 @Rydoshi Morning girls! :) Have a good day all
@sheetaly IKR! He got to portray happiness, romance, pain longing everything in the show
@Gurpreet483kaur love the acting of both mum &amp; son in the dastaan .. . . so much grace
Agar woh samandar ke teh mein thi tab bhi mujhe dhoondh nik…
These episodes of #Dastaan are so painfully perfect :'( 
Dastaan is handsdown Fawad Khan's best performance. Got All shades. Period.
@ayeshA_Nausheen @iPriyankaRaghu han in cheezon ko 'Khanay' ka yeh manage kare gi :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen ohh They used to call it Pau in Malaysia and never heard in Pakistan abhi tak. Yeh northIndian hai dish?
@FanGurling_Away I'm watching everything on TV :P how's Bashr E momin? Heard was very popular.
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 som yeh nhi change hona overnight lol 
Ppl say such stupid things you feel like banging your own head
@ayeshA_Nausheen momo kia hai?
@FanGurling_Away aah okay :) are you following any show these days?
@Reema_dsouza123 was a HUGE hit but not my type like pyare Afzal :) you can give it a try and update me :P
@FanGurling_Away hahaha you like Naveen :O
@ayeshA_Nausheen per usko good guy bhi banayen na. Hur dafa lady tortuter bun jata hai :( but still I look forward to his shows now :))
@FanGurling_Away To break it for you Naveen died in first few episodes and no flash backs of her role either in later episodes  :/
@pchakraborty111 @HalwaingAway they had to have a story ;) if he trusted him there won't be no story
@Anjly___ and couple more too . . 
And nice AVI :)
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 yeah! :) and love this about multiethnic populations. Kaam se kaam
@Reema_dsouza123 haha yuck ;) RF is RF for a reason! Such class
@AnikaFawad Saim is baccckkk and kinda creeping in Fareesas life :| 
Also Hadi seems to miss old Haya
@FanGurling_Away yeah poor guy always gets caught in such scenarios. Alvida 's pace makes up for everything :) you can give it a go
@Reema_dsouza123 exactly loved his chemistry with Humaima. Apart from these two he has played more char like this as well
@pchakraborty111 @HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen yeah but Humsafar is popular for chemistry of lead pair than anything
@NishATQaseem ji fine bus zara legs were aching so bad :(
@NishATQaseem @bushra_amina @fawadfan haha maine kiye they tweet you missed :P
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 the tolerance for differences while living abroad only. Most valuable learning imo. Thank you :)
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 repeating myself but I really feel blessed somtime to have a relatively wider view and tbh I learned
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 we do that ;)
@Reema_dsouza123 Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I don't believe in suicide ;) his grunts are so umm ugh
@Renu_258 @ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway Mohabbat Subah ka sitara hai :)
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 woah cutie :-) sk is stylish in her movies that must click with teen girls and kids.
@HaissamHussain thank you! Can't wait at all and please tweet once in a while :) good for your fans :)
Seems like pace of #Alvida is competing with speed of light :P #ImranAbbas #SanamJung #SamiraFazal #HumTV
@HaissamHussain Hellooooo to my fav Pakistani director!  I heard you're busy working on a new movie. True? :)
Poor Imran Abbas. Mostly ends up torturing women in his shows one way or other #Alvida #HumTV
4thdeath anniversary of a #Legendary Moin Akhtar htt…
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad Reem offtopic but your dp is so strongly you for me now lol whereever I see it it reminds me of you
@Renu_258 aah okay. Thanks :)
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad woah that's sweet! :) after khoobsurat his repute is different too so I'm sure he'll be approached accordingly
@crazy4fawad @Reema_dsouza123 wese I liked Alia's presence on screen too, fresh.
@ayeshA_Nausheen uff tabahi garmi! Nicee ke baarish ho jaati hain wahan. Yahan atleast 18 hrs ka hoga roza. .
@Renu_258 aahh see another recommendation :P it works slow on my phone :/
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad nah I'm totally cool :) want him to explore himself. Was just telling Som how I still can't imagine that
@Renu_258 many ppl say that but I don't find it like Indian shows however somehow I feel its dialogues are too mushy :P
@ayeshA_Nausheen ohh acha I read it as Zakham haha 
Ayesha itni garmi main rozay honay hain. Mujhe abhi se fikar ho rahi hai :P
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad then you'll understand what we are joking about :)
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad actually it had a decent run on bollywood. But if you see underage Alia in bikni and those rangeen shorts
@ayeshA_Nausheen kia hua tumhen? 
Medicine ka faida kia ab regular exercise karoon gi phir hi theek hoga yeh
@crazy4fawad found SOTY so not mature movie lol it would better have been Kjo debut movie
@Renu_258 haha yes for me too :)
@Reema_dsouza123 @crazy4fawad Reem I'm just joking on SOTY :) :p
@crazy4fawad *bright colored shorts lmao 
Going student of the year way
@crazy4fawad ditto. Hate having the flashes of him rising topless from samandur with all those six packs and short shorts lool
@Reema_dsouza123 I do too and love the platform to reach out to others. That's why keep trying to make others watch them
@Reema_dsouza123 Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha nahi boloon gi or I should repeat till you get grey head ;)
@crazy4fawad I meant songs dances and six packs waghera waghera
First day of physical training since I moved back and now I can't move my legs. I feel like crying. Never taking a long break again :@
@crazy4fawad Lol although still not able to imagine Fawad in a full fledged bollywood movie
@Reema_dsouza123 haha hum apni isi zindagi TV main boht khush hain jismain aap, Pri, Meg aur Somz atay hain. All others don't matter
@crazy4fawad sommm those muscles *arrow through heart emoji* :P
@Reema_dsouza123 ohh hehe I'm sure it will be a comic relief :D 
As soon Pri gets free am gonna pester her too :p
@Reema_dsouza123 Reem have you watched Abhi tau mein jawaan hoon telefilm? 
It features Mikaal Zulfiqar
@aleenaazhar1 @amnashahzad @_fawadakhan_ his life his choice :P :P 
It's his style but now just can't wait!
@NishATQaseem @bushra_amina @fawadfan hello :) I'm here. Howre you?
@crazy4fawad Som take 2hours to watch Abhi tau mein jawaan hoon :P it will make you happy
@AnikaFawad that talk on salary was everything. And Bushra Ansari dialogues about Umera Ahmad were so funny too. I'm smiling just reading it
@AnikaFawad omg same loved those lines and basically everything  xD
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway ab direct hi 'hate' na banao :P but yeah usually his char evolved with epis 
Hassan bhi nhi tha
@crazy4fawad I was just curious but no use ....
Normal is fine
@AnikaFawad Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha yeah love Ayesha and Mikaal together
@dubey_ruchika no problem Ruchika :)
@bhavi_ksg_fk mujhe slow lag rha boht but for cellular data I guess it's preferred as it consumes lil. .
@amnashahzad @_fawadakhan_ @Qurram soo Zaroon-ish! &lt;3
@AnikaFawad I looove it! Mikaal's best performance and glad you liked it &lt;3 #AllHailVasay ;)
New to Opera mini and it is so slow :O 
Why everyone keeps recommending it. Going back to normal browser.
@dubey_ruchika @vasaych here :) 
Considering the buzz @_fawadakhan_ created on the runway in #PSFW15 he gets a 'modelling' section in career part of his wiki <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
Mehreen J  thinks @Vasaych might also be as surprised at the stretch of #JacksonHeights. . .  
Ps still loved it! 
Mehreen Jabbar mentioned #JacksonHeights as one of her personal top favorite work! 
What more could I ask for.
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen SJ was such a disappointment in the show! Only appointment was Adeel's Taveez ;)
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen MEJ romance too. Like both Adeel and Fawad but not the respective romances lol
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen aah I know everyone does :P I'm allergic to sweet romances as a viewer :P that's why I am not huge fan of
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen I actually hated Asher character at so many points. was more on Khirad side. But what brilliant performance
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen nopes I've missed on so many things. But I guess I did watch beauty parlor lol
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen that's it. The script/dialgues never fails to annoy me :P so I just skip first epis lol
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen I always differ here. I didn't like the direction a lot too lol 
I think it was meant to go huge
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway I just know sanam Baloch ka show hai. That's it :P
@Me_Oxymoron @Gurpreet483kaur no sane person pays heed to them. They are notorious for such bull. I started ignoring them atleast 2 yrs ago
@ayeshA_Nausheen these scenes are hilarious. The way he manipulated Akbar and in turn Akbari does this to him lool
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen on part of editing and production house. .
@HalwaingAway @ayeshA_Nausheen lol it's very sweet of celebs to acknowledge Humsafar like that! Even Marina K praised it so much
@ayeshA_Nausheen @HalwaingAway how happy I was Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ;)
@ayeshA_Nausheen lmao seems like asghar ki chaaaclates are very popular :P
