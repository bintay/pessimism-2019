If you're a father with a teenage son, I challenge you to follow #YesAllWomen and discuss what you are reading from women around the world.
A project I have my students working on about the importance &amp; value of asking good questions.

Warning: if you choose to follow #YesAllWomen, your Twitter feed will explode, your eyes will be opened and your heart will be moved.
Every man on Twitter should be following #YesAllWomen right now and hear the voices of women, then choose to BE the change!
