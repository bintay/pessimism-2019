@MississaugaPF We could surpass the target at this rate! Hope we keep this fantastic growth going (+  more outreach for private planting!).
Exciting panel, starting with @SarahLynnBurch: "Can we transform communities that mirror the shift in our values?" #readysteadyadapt
Presenting art at the @OntarioClimate Symposium today, follow along online as the day progresses! #readysteadyadapt 
Here we go! Looking forward to the sharing of ideas on all things climate! Good attendance by @envwaterloo studentd! 
.@weathernetwork Even your science-based articles are poor - random garden video above, "storm hunters" below - why?? 
Shocking contrast in #GreatLakes watershed, up to 30+°C diff. - cold/wet (upper) vs hot/dry (lower). @environmentont 
#nailedit The 7 Most Blatant Lies Famous Brands Based Entire Ads On 
@stephenyu_ 1000's of years in the making; no certification, delays, or consultation required, just solid work and solid results!
@carolynhparrish Good to see - I'm assuming those trees aren't Ash (so won't get torn anyways)? Looking forward to two-way bike lanes there!
@Oakvillegreen @townofoakville @oakvillewfm Might want to wait for rain first, those plants will cook in seconds...#climatechanged
@TakePart The freeze-up, while comprehensive, occurred for an alarmingly short period (late, rapid onset and early, rapid break-up)...
@weathernetwork As usual, no a mention of climate change, cause, long-term trend or how severe this weather really is. Thanks for 0 science.
Time will tell, but I am hopeful! Alberta election could break #climatechange logjam in Canada. 
.@weathernetwork @TorontoStar @CBCNews Up to 20°C above normal in parts of N. ON - how does this not make major news? 
@jk_rowling Canada loves you very much, we hope you come by, even for a visit~ Photos from my home, @citymississauga. 
Worth learning from, @citymississauga! Salt Lake City planning a protected intersection for cycling. 
Less weather roller-coaster more "highway to hell"...Could we care less? #climatereality @weathernetwork @envwaterloo 
Perhaps we'll snap out of our "endless water paradise" lie, here out east? This IS a connected planet. #banfracking 
@Kathleen_Wynne, Ontario Liberal Party: Stop the Privatization of Hydro One! Where are the #revenuetools? 
The records we don't want broken...March 2015 made climate history, and not in a good way. 
Story in progress, nester - hoping for moist/cool spot, baked instead! Gave water, got thanks! @UWaterloo #KWAwesome 
Another day, another terrible wake-up, while cleaning nothing! Sad that bylaw is powerless. #pollution @citywaterloo 
Saw this beauty in @WaterlooPrk, on Father David Bauer!
Dry, unseasonable warmth continues, but I can still explore! Is this a red-tailed, @DavidSuzukiFDN? #NatureIsCalling 
@citywaterloo Thanks for the update, I understand the limited resources, is there an email I can reach? I have some ideas for this...
Beautiful blooms in May at @UWaterloo woodlot - just need some rain now! #Trillium #TroutLily #NatureIsCalling 
What does the NDP’s stunning Alberta win mean for Stephen Harper and the Federal election? 
Keeping more progressive governments left to repair broken bridges, delaying smart policy + community investment... 
@inthebirdnest Hahaha, who knows what's underneath! @agotoronto
@MikeHudema #OrangeisthenewAlberta! Harper, you're next! Hoping the UK has a similar result, too!
@CBCNews Good riddance. The rich and famous have been given a "get-out-of-punishment-free card" for long enough. Let's see justice served.
#OrangeisthenewAlberta - can we get this trending, please? :]
@leadnowca @albertaNDP @RachelNotley 
@environmentca Looks like we won't need to make quite so many calls, now that Alberta is ready to wean itself off it's oil addiction! :D
@stephenyu_ @tammyYTwong @SonEger @NavT1 @Jenn_Gies LOVE your Province! Congrats, and thank you - Canada just got a whole lot better!
Exactly. &lt;3 to Alberta! 
Fantastic work by @citymississauga! Come out + learn more about MiWay5 + give feedback! #hopingforgrid @PEYAlliance 
.@CBCNews Any chance the entire speech by @RachelNotley is available online? The incredible 4min, 17seconds were a wonderful start! Thanks!
So much good will come from this! Real resilience starts with investment in the environment! 
.@SonEger Great leaders "banking" on sanctuaries to protect our most vulnerable reefs and fish! :] 
A wise man once said, "My friends... let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world." Congrats, @albertaNDP! #abvote
In 2 days, 6 hrs connecting w nature: teaching students at @UWEcologyLab + native planting! #natureiscalling #goose&lt;3 
@citywaterloo thanks!
A real leader who knows how to #rejectfear! 
@CycleLoan Hope to see you in the near future at @EnvUTM - would be a great compliment/enhancement to the campus bikeshare! @UofTMississauga
@noctame @OntLiberal Fair point, I just wish they would read the darn thing~
Baboom! Liberals and Greens sending a strong message for #election2015! Alberta, you listening? #peivotes #abvote  
Amazing news! History has been made for the @greenparty - great progress leading to #election2015! :D @ElizabethMay  
.@Kathleen_Wynne @OntarioEDU Thanks for putting kids/teens health &amp; safety first - Ontario supports this, not misinformation! #supportsexed
@SharkDancing @lkoch99 So do open fields bordering dev! These are weak arguments, but again, your choice where you live/bike - we'll enjoy!
Pure ignorance. Have any protestors read #sexed legislation? IT'S OPTIONAL! Stay strong/smart, @OntLiberal! 
@SharkDancing @lkoch99 Funny how zoning has almost every hydro corridor bordered on either side by housing or some form of development?
.@ElizabethMay They are spineless, when push comes to shove. Now, we all get the shove, daily, by the police, gov. - whoever, whenever. #C51
This #JanesWalk gave me a solid 2 hours of nature loving in the city! :D #NatureIsCalling
@shawnmicallef @GTAMOVEnetwork That looks so futuristic! The bikeshare makes it dreamy~
@SammyTangir @PEYAlliance @EcosourceGreen We were all so happy! #springlife
@Dorothy_Tomiuk @JanesWalk_MSaug @leaf That tree's seen so much! Thanks for sharing! :]
.@Dorothy_Tomiuk Awesome! I hope every hydro-corridor is eventually a "bike highway"! @bikeMississauga @enersourcenews @HydroOne
@Dorothy_Tomiuk @JanesWalk_MSaug Any idea on the age? Saw an incredible oak with @leaf last week near the Iceland Arena, too!
A gorgeous Killdeer and her nest @ Iceland Teaching Garden at today's #JanesWalkMissi! @PEYAlliance @EcosourceGreen 
This duck makes a racket every day - I might know why! #onthehunt #Ihopetheyarebestfriends @citywaterloo #kwawesome 
Fantastic #JanesWalk today @ Iceland Teaching Garden, led by @PEYAlliance! #localfood #JanesWalkMissi @AmyZiXuanLiou 
Congratulations, @googlemaps on your new map - slower, less responsive, missing features, overly complex, too many boxes - see ya, for good!
Terrible loss of community-based seed banks. Solution? Keep'em growing! 
It will take global spirit and remembrance to rejuvenate. Rebuilding Nepal’s soul a daunting task. 
@chrisyyao That's frustrating! Give them time (or, as Iroh might say, contemplate life over a warm cup of tea)~ :] 
@clreyes_ How...crafty! :P GL~
Climate change touches all of us - past, present and future...How much are we willing to lose b4 we #ActOnClimate? 

@tooba_shakeel @visitpama That is absolutely stunning. I'm floored.
@WaterlooLibrary This is a welcome alternative to the manure-like smell across the city due to those easterly winds!
@Kathleen_Wynne Will Ontario take the next step, putting forward a stronger GHG reduction target - like our carbon trade partners in Cali?
@noctame @350 Really hope this pushes us (+ Quebec) to higher ambition, considering we all form a carbon trade pact!
@Forests_Ontario Quick fyi, the image for the planting event at the bottom says the date is Sept 24th, 2014, 9:30-noon!
@Forests_Ontario Thanks - would you have the # to be planted - it would be great to put this registration link on your site, too!
@arcotarun @RegionWaterloo @water_institute @UW_SWIGS @WatershedsCAN Is that a regional value? Scary to think of total in our Great Lakes...
Sign up, sign up! Challenge starts tomorrow! @vickipoohbear @PEYAlliance @EcosourceGreen @envwaterloo #hikeseveryday 
@CVC_CA @Forests_Ontario Awesome! What's the target? How do I register?
.#Rejectfear of deniers! #ActOnClimate! @vickipoohbear @fatinic @moe_qureshi @chrisyyao @aianbinlayo check this out! 
@citywaterloo Both! So an archive of past projects and links/dates/details to current/future consultations, only 1 of current 5 has this.
The reality is the U.S. will meet its target to reduce emissions 17% below 2005. Canada will not. #climatefail 
The solution was there long before this "trend" got out of control. Now, finally, we are coming home. @gracenjohnson 
.@citywaterloo Another question, do all parks/projects include/plan to include garbage and recycling bins? Sometimes it's hard to find one!
.@citywaterloo Interesting park projects! Where can I find consultation details, many don't have any on the website.
Help communities adapt to our #climatereality. I gave 5 weeks of clean cooking through @Care2 rewards! Sign up! 
@CVCCYC @CVC_CA What about grapevine? I'm seeing entire woodlots/corridors felled by it, but it never seems to be removed...#nopredators
Also check out the Jane's Walk being led by @PEYAlliance members on May 3rd, 4pm! 
What a refreshing idea! More than 200K plastic bottles were dumped in the @UCF Reflecting Pond: 
Today is the big SWIGS AGM! Join us at 5pm in the Grad House! Great place to #network on all things #water! @SonEger 
@Mug2Punter @Steedore You can almost hear the collective sigh of millions on twitter from this broken defense based on words, not science.
@Steedore That's a good word to describe "denier", will keep it in mind, thanks!
@citywaterloo @WaterlooPrk Thanks for sharing, quite familiar with these. I don't see change in students/parks/business waste output, so...?
.@Steedore Yeah, so great right? Thanks 4 supporting global efforts to tackle climate change! #ActonClimate, one denier at a time. :]
The truth behind men's and women's body wash will make you feel dirty (via @Upworthy) 
The 86 richest people in Canada now have as much money as the 11.4 million poorest, and you know, we're cool w that. 
Feral Cities: How Animals are Going Urban Like Never Before (book) - reconnect to nature, to wonder. 
We should take heed of the climate reality out west; improve water management now, save time and $ before it hurts. 
@Steedore @WWF Motivating humanity to live with a less energy-intensive, polluting and consumptive lifestyle are noble goals worth pursuing.
@Steedore @WWF It's a motivational timeline, not meant to be taken literally - major changes in climate, however, fit within that "deadline"
@GTAMOVEnetwork @UofTMississauga You're right, not officially set in stone, but it seems to be preferred mode when mentioned @ meetings.
@GTAMOVEnetwork @UofTMississauga Dundas BRT already planned, will serve UTM trips effectively w transfers incl GO bus/train + Hurontario LRT
@shmarv @ElizabethMay So proud of everything the Green Party has done, their time for central power is coming soon...
@Steedore @WWF Not sure who that is, could you please provide a link/context?
@EGCityWorks Depending on the Federal (and AB) election turnouts, might be time to dedicate focus to local level + business/banks/insurance.
@berryonline @CityKitchener @VictoriaParkKit I encourage council to increase programs to edu. students + enforce by-laws. #activeANDreactive
@Steedore @WWF You're absolutely right about the ice, but have you looked into the complex causes? 
@webwildink @WWF Most people care with a passion and are making a difference! it's great to see so many nations taking action pre-COP21.
.@ryanmhlo This is horribly tragic...such a peaceful and kind nation, taking care of their environment, living within their means... :'[
So excited, well done @Metrolinx! Union Station York GO Concourse Opening on Monday #April27! 
@WaterlooPrk @citywaterloo Would be great if the city could expand litter education through more bins, student outreach + bylaw enforcement.
@WaterlooPrk @citywaterloo Thanks! I'll keep at it daily knowing that it's what's not there, rather than what is, that leaves a +'ve mark!
Pray for rapid rescue and recovery in #NepalEarthquake. Latest news: 
Best government yet! Now we need to give them the support they deserve! It's high time we funded infrastructure. 
@MississaugaPF Hope the plants will be ok in tonight's frost??
.@citywaterloo FYI this sludge/debris/garbage mess is along the E shore of Silver Lake in @WaterlooPrk - I clean up the land half, daily...
Doing my best to live #earthdayeveryday but seems unsafe for me to clean-up in the lake - some help, @citywaterloo? 
@citymississauga Particularly support for french-speaking Canadians, integration services, how to rent, university opp., english classes...
Hi @citymississauga, I have a friend thinking of moving (+husband) to our great city, from Quebec! Any tips/support would be appreciated!
Spring's blooming all over @UWaterloo (rain, snow or sun)! Do you know what plant this is? @weathernetwork #kwawesome 
@sjaybrown @SeanCampbellWR @mathew_thijssen @trplanet @andresafm @PlanManagerLiz I'll be there, thanks Sarah!
@GTAMOVEnetwork @Metrolinx @Suniya_K @GOtransit @GoodLifeFitness Haha that would keep'em sweating! I hope GO is noting this high-level plan!
@grescoe Fed budget here a joke, balanced budget at expense of massive # closed sci/env jobs/programs + 2 year delay 4 paltry transit funds.
@grescoe It's pretty ugly this side of the border too - Toronto must be centre of universe, upset rest of ON finally getting $ for network!
@GTAMOVEnetwork @Metrolinx @Suniya_K @GOtransit @GoodLifeFitness I was thinking within the station (mr feasible) but that's a cool idea too!
As new leader of the Arctic Council, the US will focus on the region's Big Thaw, unlike Canada...#ActonClimate 
On point! I hope Canadians can see through the "truthiness" haze (sometimes dipped in tar...). #Cdnpoli #Election2015 
So much positive energy on #EarthDay! Let's support green actions, every day! 
@carolynhparrish Either that or shift to more local consumption/less consumption overall - I think the sheer # of trucks is out of control!
@CVC_CA @EcosourceGreen 
Frosted flakes, part of a balanced breakfast~ (see what I did there?) :D @citywaterloo @weathernetwork #KWAwesome 
:'] What a wonderful story: Nursing home residents are certain this tiny dog is from heaven. 
@GTAMOVEnetwork Exactly, no free ride over here, we're getting a major boost, just like TO has...for nearly every big project! #TOimpatient
@citymississauga Would the Province be able to play a role? @Kathleen_Wynne #SaugaEarthDays15
While image on right isn't "gov-official", it speaks a loud truth: Ian Rowlands presenting @KitchLibrary #uwearthweek 
.@citymississauga @MiLivingGreen Is the city taking action to compel nurseries to sell only native species (and/or label!) #SaugaEarthDays15
@citymississauga @MiLivingGreen Could you provide some detail on current species used to replace ash trees? Any fruit trees in parks?
@roezone I think that's appropriate! @rideionrt makes almost no noise, basically glides on tracks + electric; add living walls + we're set!
Climate Change: Why it Matters to You - speakers+panel @envwaterloo at @KitchLibrary, great way to wrap up #EarthDay 
Way to go, Noah. Climate change needs more champions like you! #ActonClimate every day, incl. #EarthDay! 
@Metrolinx @GOtransit Love all the #transitprogress! Ideas: indoor stationary "reading" bikes while we wait? Touchscreen maps? #staymobile
Incredible, scary and humbling - maps of our changing world, both natural and artificial. #EarthDay  
@uoftmagazine @UofTDaniels Amazing! Innovation to help the planet, we need more ideas like this! I hope everyone has a "bee hotel" someday!
@frescolicense but of course, and thanks! Happy Earth Day!
@deeceevoice @Upworthy @envwaterloo Thank you! We love adding beauty to our campus, helps reduce stress and bring out pollinators!
@B1A4_CNU Put all that fame and money to good use by donating or doing some outdoor work for #EarthDay!
Feeling green? Unleash it. 
Protecting the Earth is about equality for all: 1000's of Mexican farmworkers march 15 miles as strike talks continue 
@Glen4ONT let's take action 4 Great Lakes - lower chem inputs + erosion, tackling invasive species + ban microbeads! 
@Upworthy Coming up @ gardens tended by @envwaterloo students - beautiful bulbs! Aptly named the Spring Garden~ 
@Upworthy Education is empowering, whether bringing out your friends to a tree-planting, hosting a soap-making workshop or taking a hike!
@Upworthy My daily hike to uni includes time to clean up others mess, hopefully set an example for others! :] 
When people say #EarthDay is every day, do they mean it? This is what I collect daily on my walk to @UWaterloo... :S 
@DinaJon60818043 @eleanor70001 @CBCKW891 Truer words never spoken!
@citywaterloo Gotta celebrate nature, it never judges and always delivers! If only humans could reciprocate in how we treat this blue dot!
Wow some amazing #EarthDay weather! Past 2hrs got snow, ice, rain, graukel, ice pellets + hail! @CBCKW891 #KWAwesome 
@Upworthy Remarkably, despite fewer resources + global support and increased vulnerability, I think big progress is in developing countries.
@google Thanks for the awesome doodle today - are you taking action to help protect these animals, like the critically trafficked Pangolin?
SWEET! I'm a pangolin! What's your #EarthDay Doodle quiz animal? 
Love that winter-spring dance, especially on #EarthDay! All I could ask for from nature! @weathernetwork #KWAwesome <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Oh #EarthDay of beauty, giving me snow in @citywaterloo - I think I'll just run outside and jump for joy! :D #KWAwesome forever. #IAMPROSNOW
@Glen4ONT Yikes. @OntarioPCParty, @OntarioNDP, can't we get along + support a healthy Earth? It's ok to admit current gov. is an env. champ!
Help nurture more leaders, stewards, gardeners, planners + much more! An organization I owe so much - @PEYAlliance: 
@stephenyu_  I can't remember funding ever being approved and no-build happening - even the Ottawa LRT bungle got refunded and reborn!
Thanks to all who helped make the dream of @citymississauga - @CityBrampton LRT a reality, especially @Kathleen_Wynne gov. + @Metrolinx!
Looks like the announcement was a coincidence with #federalbudget (or maybe...) but ecstatic for @citymississauga! 
@UWaterloo @envwaterloo Gave up and found it thanks to Google, its a wonderful page, so maybe give it a home link/news article priority?
@UWaterloo @envwaterloo Searched for 30 min to try + reach this-
@envwaterloo Would love to see student stories/highlights/awards and how they contribute to campus sustainability! -&gt;
DO IT + WIN! @ESCoffeeShop @EGSAuwaterloo @sustain_campus @UWGreenHouse @UW_SWIGS @UWEcologyLab @UWAGP @envwaterloo 
Repair, reflect and remember lessons from the past, too! Let's all do our part and keep this planet fresh and clean! 
@environmentont Gonna add a few of my fav "R's" to this: Repair, reflect, remember (from my elders)! (@DavidSuzuki that means you!) :D
@SpacingStore @Spacing @GOtransit This makes me so happy, looking forward to my first visit!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@weathernetwork @citywaterloo Alas it was a fleeting wonder, the roofs are all dry now!
.@weathernetwork Post-rain shower, cold air sweeps by, the sun comes out, now clouds of fog coming off the roofs! #KWAwesome @citywaterloo
A must-read! Learning from our planet's past to secure our future.  
@CBCQuirks @ElizKolbert Congrats, very well deserved! A jolt for all of us to take action + care for the planet, lest history be repeated...

@cusm_muhc Fantastic! Looking forward to full organics roll-out, that is a big step! Are batteries/printer ink also recycled?
@UofTMississauga @julia_see Do come back to explore the beautiful trails/river/geology/wildlife! I find many miss out w so much studying! :P
@cusm_muhc Thanks for taking this health/environment leadership, please share best practices w other CDN hospitals, like @Trillium_Health!
@regionofpeel Thank you! Adding this to my bookmarks~
@CBCNews If only they had him climb down on his own...
Very impressed, more hospitals need a a bright, green retrofit! Congrats to the new @cusm_muhc! 
.@GOtransit hoping the new GO shelters at WLU will soon include waste/recycling bins? #earthweek 
@MississaugaPF Tree removal during #EarthWeek? :( Hope this is just Ash removal, to be replaced with some native gems?

Bad enough @googlemaps doesn't recognize when I "save to classic version", if they remove this old format (which is far superior), I'm gone.
@PRESTOcard @Metrolinx Will do, thanks! Was unsure b/c GO refund clearly marked with side panel button, but not the case for local transit.
@MiWayHelps @PRESTOcard @citymississauga @MIRANET_Network That would be really useful data - more for accountability (is program working?).
@davebeaton4 @CVC_CA @citymississauga Fair enough, I just want to help plant as many as possible! (UTM has an event then, too...) :P
@kylebap @GTAMOVEnetwork Please oh please let's tear it down! #reconnectTO #reconnecttoLakeOntario
@GTAMOVEnetwork I've always wondered why the price difference???
Sweet. Do we have stats on this, @regionofpeel, @RegionWaterloo? 
@CityPlanTO @CanUrbanism Very nice! Would like to see "details (doc)" link, social media links and clear wording on orig. vs. new zoning.
@MIRANET_Network @CVC_CA Same day/time as the big @citymississauga green market event? Why split those interested and lower attendance?
Great leadership from @ThomasMulcair NDP - puts health/safety of env. + ppl first! 
The records keep falling - will we smarten up in time, or keep complaining about every season until we're cooked? 
More reason to get outside as much as possible! #good4eyes @EvergreenCanada nearsightedness has doubled in 50 years!: 
@Metrolinx @PRESTOcard @MiWayHelps Thank you. For those without Twitter, could this info please be added to the PRESTO site? #nocluesthere

@MiLivingGreen @MississaugaPF Great ideas to make our community closer/healthier/active! Challenge us! #backyardfood 
@stephenyu_ @cityofcalgary That's horrifying bank erosion! What's YYC doing about this? Hope they're funding LID for flood adaptation, too!
@jen_keesmaat @g_meslin True! We also need more of the grey ("green") areas in-between, with diffuse/scattered light, perfect for reading!
Was excited 4 my 1st @AIRMILES card but: 2 envelopes, two twin letters + three cards is ridiculous and unsustainable! 
@VoteForAngel Neat! I heard about green noise walls a few years back (
@PRESTOcard @Metrolinx Where do I report an error in my PRESTO charges on my card? No option on your site! @MiWayHelps told me to contact...

@citywaterloo @Uptown_North Is there a one-stop shop to learn about all the neighbourhood groups? How did this new one get created?
In case you're curious where our middle-class went (among other reasons)...@JohnTory @BonnieCrombie @Kathleen_Wynne  
I'm going to learn/network on #roadtoParis + share art! @Glen4ONT will be there, too! Will you? @envwaterloo @EnvUTM 
@Dustin_Carey How was I not following you until now - I think I'm going to be on twitter more now! :P
@citywaterloo I wonder if we will overachieve on climate change someday, too? #kwawesome could be even more awesome...#educate #empower
@citymississauga @regionofpeel If people aren't doing this, is our solution really just a kind suggestion? We need to take further action.
@citymississauga @regionofpeel I do clean ups daily, run workshops + online outreach, but without bins/enforcement general pop. won't act.
@citymississauga @regionofpeel Thanks for the suggestion but w all due respect this is not a solution...we need basic public infrastructure!
Mississauga’s One Million Trees Ready to Dig In for 2015 
This July: historic action against the tar sands, across Canada. Will you be there? 
@UofTNews Hi there, I have stopped receiving "News@UofT" to my utoronto inbox since the January issue - who should I contact?
Despicable, this government just gets worse and worse: 
@citymississauga @BonnieCrombie @carolynhparrish It's sad we had to take it this far...
.@citymississauga @BonnieCrombie It's time to smarten up and follow national law (and logic) - remove the lords prayer, period. #equality
@s2gUrbanAgApp @MississaugaPF @transitnguelph @transitionTO New to me, what a great service! We don't have a "Transition Mississauga" - yet!
Canada, this July, join 3 days of historic action for jobs, justice and the #climate -  We &gt; Tar Sands. 
Premiers end #climatechangesummit w call to action for Ottawa. @pmharper gov. worst ever for env./climate targets. 
@MississaugaPF I think local support for this exists - @EcosourceGreen @PEYAlliance @NFFTT @leaf @Food_Bank @SaugaFruitTree @MIRANET_Network
.@MississaugaPF Crab-apples once planted, but those had poor maintenance, future food edu possible w new fruit trees! 
@MississaugaPF Sorry, I didn't mean street trees (salt/sediment/exhaust!) but rather in parks, far from roads, like a mini fruit-orchard?
@regionofpeel Regarding issue of no recycling/limited garbage bins @ mail boxes, any updates from waste management staff? Litter only /\...
.@christyclarkbc, @JimPrentice, it's time for a serious rethink. Pipelines DO NOT help the climate. #cdnpoli #COP21 
Stay local, more veggies, + avoid food from parched California, the drought is at the mercy of farmers #poorplanning 
@NWS @NOAA And it's only early spring...a ferocious El Nino might wake up these climate-denier states, if nothing else...#nospringshowers
@noctame @TheCurrentCBC Most of that fortune is being lost too - they could take a lesson from Norway~
@OntMinFinance @SousaCharles @Metrolinx Sincerely hope this very progressive gov. will not miss opp. to push transit fwd via revenue tools!
.@TheCurrentCBC Feds still afraid to admit they have no idea how to regulate carbon @ Fed. level, let alone oil&amp;gas. #rhetoric #notsurprised
.@TheCurrentCBC Listened to Cons. after @Glen4ONT...Hate's carbon management..."hard-working CDN's...families...@JustinTrudeau?" #emptywords
@TheCurrentCBC @MikeHudema @Kathleen_Wynne @phcouillard Set the policy and they will follow? We can't keep waiting, AB is on the wrong side.
.@PEYAlliance Needs to come out in spades (and maybe there will be digging too!). Hope this becomes an annual event! 
@VoteForAngel People in cars &gt; People walking...Basic upgrades like street trees, public furniture and permeable pavers go a long way! #LID

@fatinic @climatekeith @vickipoohbear @dianadyoon + Keep the coal in the hole, and in general, Heave-Steve! :P
@GRT_ROW Very pleased to see public consultation comments taken seriously, this is an excellent plan supported by the community! #KWAwesome
While @pmharper + @leonaaglukkaq drag Canada down the steps of global climate action, Ontario surges forward. #COP21

@AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY @KrankyKanuck @MikeHansen613 How about the current dramatic increase in ~150yrs of severe storms, "climate refugees"?
@AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY @KrankyKanuck @MikeHansen613 Interested in having a real dialogue? Thoughts on human contribution to climate change?
@UWaterlooLife @CBCKW891 Beautiful icy morning here in Waterloo, loving every moment of this deep freeze - stay safe! 
@Kathleen_Wynne So proud of Ontario working to address the climate challenge right here at home, leading the charge up a proverbial hill!
The magical view from my window, what a spectacular winter this is! #DreamsDoComeTrue @weathernetwork @citywaterloo 
@AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY @KrankyKanuck @MikeHansen613 @ljbeebe So I've read all your posts, may I ask you a general question?
@unsorrycanuck @AlbertaGrl @MikeHansen613 @KrankyKanuck @JoanneBLY 1-5% higher, with 14% more renewable power on grid (balanced by hydro).
@OFIA_info @Glen4ONT Are all Ontario forestry operations @FSC_Canada certified? Looking forward to a healthy and innovative forestry sector!
@AlbertaGrl @MikeHansen613 @KrankyKanuck @JoanneBLY Glad I could help you run in circles today, good luck while the world moves forward!
@AlbertaGrl @KrankyKanuck @JoanneBLY If I had one I'd share it, but the delusion - a harsh word, let's say denial - starts with you.
@KrankyKanuck @AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY I love them too, must be a match! Belief only takes you so far, add a dash of science and reason, too!
@AlbertaGrl @KrankyKanuck @JoanneBLY Cheers, we'll use it well. A transition to a sustainable way of living sounds great, thanks! :]
@AlbertaGrl @KrankyKanuck @JoanneBLY You might be happy about that someday (assuming you get informed), just ask your @YourAlberta why!
@KrankyKanuck @AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY They come from the Federal gov., with a slice from AB - thoughts on where your oil subsidies come from?
@AlbertaGrl @KrankyKanuck @JoanneBLY Any thoughts on how subsidized your "peanut butter" oil prod. is? Or does that slip under "denial"?
@KrankyKanuck @AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY Hmm, tax and spend? Almost sounds like...every government in the world! A real bizarro place, ain't it?
@KrankyKanuck @AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY We won't be needing your $, you're on a bit of a downturn, I heard? We'll take our green jobs, thanks!
@KrankyKanuck @AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY You must be running out of breath, well done! Last I checked, AB is considering carbon cap + wind pwr!
@AlbertaGrl @JoanneBLY @KrankyKanuck Alberta, eh? Have fun with that, we'll be solving climate issues here, join us when you can handle it?
@CBCQuirks Looking forward to it! Another book I just discovered with northern perspectives: The Meaning of Ice - 
@UWEcologyLab SWEET! I always loved the snow amounts at  43.468750, -80.542483 #memories
Do it up @PEYAlliance @MYACMISSISSAUGA @Studiooo89 MT @MiLivingGreen Great parks need great ideas! What's yours? 
@environmentont Love it! Ontario is well on it's way to leading not just the continent, but the world - so proud of this Province!
Exciting what happens when we support nature: Louisiana's Threatened Coast Is Growing Patches of New Land! 
.@nytimes Hard to fathom the pain behind this...for so many people, we have fallen backward, rather than forward, to embrace them.
.@MissionBlue Tragic! Every community needs min. setbacks to protect water bodies, no matter how small, they are the "veins of the planet".
.@NOAAClimate Massive, numerous storms up the east coast of N.A. seem to be "sucking heat" out of the oceans...possible negative feedback?
Incredible, beautiful, unexpected lake effect snow here in @RegionWaterloo - the winter that keeps on giving. :]

To be speechless, or speak out? Perhaps only one helps solve this abominable murder - #muslimlivesmatter 
@BonnieCrombie Raising funds with transit/parking revenue tools, stormwater user-fees and by-law enforcement will fuel sustainability, too!

Morning @CAPSACEAU! 2 ques, is there still reg. in the am today? Is the train museum tour time correct (40 min tour but says 12:00-1:15pm?)
So crisp, so cold! Several kind strangers later I have made it in one piece to my BNB in Winnipeg! @CAPSACEAU, see you tomorrow! #wintercity
@citywaterloo So all the pond rinks all across the region are illegal? That definition seems to make public man-made rinks illegal too...
Here I come! So excited to enjoy winter at it's fullest at @CAPSACEAU Winnipeg! #winterbike #winterskate #wintercity 
@PEYAlliance @TheVeganSociety Rock it PEYA!
@UWaterloo Yup, don't improve your policy, just have everyone risk their safety individually? #nodaycare #transitchaos #slowplowing
@GTAMOVEnetwork @HSRTransit @GOtransit They won't be seeing much payback on those fares if every bus/train is cancelled! Transit #snowday?

@Kathleen_Wynne Have we considered re-allocating funds from GTA West towards immediate gains for transit, like LRT, high-speed rail and BRT?
@ParksCanada @StudentsOnIce Wonderful there's enough budget to run a crucial program like this! I'll definitely apply post-masters, next yr!

@EcosourceGreen @PEYAlliance @PDSB_eco Important - share/RT: via @regionofpeel Changes are coming to waste collection 
@Glen4ONT I support legislation mandating composting, big "closed-bins" option, 2-bag garbage max and stronger litter penalties across ON.
@citymississauga My concern is regarding the forested area which is still healthy to the NW - is that Sheridan Phase 3 or to be determined?
@citymississauga Where will this new green be located? Thanks for sharing this excellent survey, impressed with community garden! option!
@ClimateStudents @UWEcologyLab @UWaterlooLife @UWFeds @GSA_UWaterloo Thank you for sharing the event (your team/exec can come too!). :]
How urban designers are getting Canadians outside - even in the deepest freeze. #communityconnection #embracewinter 
@MississaugaSnow Lots and lots of residual salt...please apply sparingly, some sand, some smarter spreading! 
Suburban solution is now dead-end, no longer what the model intended,  can't "grow/work/live in place"... #fillinthegaps #generationedcity
@carolynhparrish It's unusual, but old traditions stick, for better or worse. Heritage sites, on the other hand... #demographicdisconnect
Should slow/de-growth be proposed within ON growth plans? Good long-term plan, but fast growth threatens Greenbelt/farms. #generationedcity
Just 1 more day till @ClimateStudents event! Let's share and RT this for a packed crowd! @UWEcologyLab @UWaterlooLife @UWFeds @GSA_UWaterloo
@carolynhparrish Brings me back to @citymississauga Council meeting a few weeks back...we've got a long way to go. 
Better urban design could add years to my life, your life, everyone's life! Help transform your community for good. 
@HuffPostGreen Regular pictures of a fairly light snowfall...from above? Perhaps show where the real snowstorm hit, further north?
This Friday, #climateconversations are coming to @UWaterloo! Join us at @ClimateStudents for our Post-COP20 event! 
@mike_va_burrell @CBCKW891 @RegionWaterloo Thanks!
@CBCKW891 I had no idea there were Bald Eagles in @RegionWaterloo, that's incredible! Any idea where I could likely spot this majestic bird?
@grescoe @WholeFoods That makes me oddly sad &amp; happy - right place, wrong time; poor sign of (mostly rich) people unprep. for such events...
@BonnieCrombie @johntoryTO How I wish they didn't scrap the Scarborough LRT...all the money wasted could go have gone to our LRT needs!
@CVC_CA Perhaps naturalization of Sheridan Creek? MT @environmentca Seeking projects that benefit the environment

@OntMinEnergy Any update on #greenbutton initiative? Apps for pilot, new communities beyond London/Hydro One? 1 year since last update...
@SonEger What I struggle w is not the means but the +'ve feedback of decline due to killing (+throwing away) 1000's of juvenile fish/shrimp.
@jk_rowling This art takes me back to memories of magic and wonder when I was reading #HarryPotter. 
@weathernetwork You almost had a serious discussion going, but you had to take the low road and complain, as usual. 
@CBCNews @weathernetwork After much digging I found this...near-record drought in many areas in S.On - news, anyone? 
@onwxcentre @environmentont @OntarioTravel @OntarioNature Thank you, looks like my fears are valid - near-record drought in parts of S.On!
Crime doesn't pay, unless you're a friend of the Harper Conservatives. 
@environmentca Seasonal Outlook link on main page leads to no results...why is it a featured post? #thelatestcuts? 
@environmentont @OntarioTravel @OntarioNature @onwxcentre Searching for data on classification+history of winter droughts in ON, any ideas?
@weathernetwork @ontariokevin There. is. no. snow. How about talking about that for once? We would appreciate it! #climatechange
@keithmartinmd Magnificent! Is the river fully frozen?
@shahselbe @SonEger @WaittInstitute Thoughts on the recent paradox of mosquito nets? I'm stunned by the new issue...
@rickmercer $10 buys a net, saves a life - depletes an ecosystem, poisons a community? We may need to reconsider... 
@gracenjohnson @CityLab Questions about lack of affordability despite shared $ - should apply this for urban reuse projects to cut costs.
I hope the @citymississauga BRT is looking at best practices like this! let's make our BRT urban, for future growth! 
Check it out @gracenjohnson! Can millennials do this too? MT From @CityLab Can Boomers make cohousing mainstream? 
@BonnieCrombie Are there any tools to check that the ice is safe thickness? Very impressed w your support of traditional play outdoors!

@Kathleen_Wynne Let's Strengthen Ontario’s Greenbelt - endless sprawl is not a solution! #degrowth 
Ask Canada to Hold a Referendum on a Carbon-Fee-and-Dividend Program. Money for all Canadians, not carbon polluters! 
@erashish14 Advertising is a form of pollution, in my opinion. Getting solar on rooftops is easy and affordable, we just need local policy!

@noctame @envwaterloo @UWEcologyLab Might happen, lots of coffee grinds free to pick-up from Starbucks, just need an entrepreneur!
Sun, cold + flurries, but where's the major winter snow? Most of N.A. seems below normal - El Niño to blame? @environmentca @weathernetwork
@stephjcrock Need one of those winter off-road strollers! :P
We should do a hike or skate soon, hopefully a fresh coating of snow to boot!
@noctame @envwaterloo @UWEcologyLab Got some oyster mushrooms in the works this winter, will post results once fruiting!

@bikeMississauga Can we make one please? MT @CfSC_Ott We put lots of #Ottawa #cycling data in this CfSC Infographic! 
@jen_keesmaat Would love to see more trees as well as "opening day" heights...might look sparse otherwise!
Truth! MT @envwaterloo It can be hard to imagine with the chilly temps, but 2014 was hotter than any year since 1880! 
Earth pushed beyond four of nine ‘planetary boundaries,’ by humans. We need nature, not vice versa. 
@grescoe Would be interesting to compare this data to other indicators on emissions/family+home size/walkability/transit local and global!
@ClimateDesk There's something strange going on in the SH...I suspect it is a yet to be understood relationship to climate change, but what?

@noctame One which doesn't compromise our natural goods and services for future generations. We need to be less consumers and more stewards!

@UPexpress @PRESTOcard Despite the precedents across North America, where the highest airport express 1-way is $10 - why do we go higher?
@StevenDelDuca @UPexpress If it's on budget, let's consider another budget that matters - the majority of us who can't afford to ride it!
@MississaugaPF Or we could embrace it and the amazing outdoor sports and winter fun it brings! #lovewinter #allseasons #IAMPROSNOW

@citymississauga Than you - Has the city set targets on reducing future salt use (good work so far btw, but there still room to cut back)?
@CECHR_UoD Thanks for the searching, I think you're probably right!
@HuffPostCanada @DavidSuzukiFDN We're coming, I promise - for those who have fought and protected before us and those still yet to come.
@CECHR_UoD Assumed this was satellite, but thanks for the reply!
@TheCurrentCBC Colonizing "Mid-Canada" ensures a legacy of sprawl, unsustainable pop. growth, resource ext. + natural areas fragmentation.
@MississaugaSnow @citymississauga What kind of salt formula do we use? Is it liquid? Perhaps a sand mix? #saltlightly #cleanrivers4all

@gracenjohnson Had two friends in TO get a bat visit in their apart last year, so checked out bat centre tips. How I wish it was @batman...

@gracenjohnson Dim/no lights, rubber gloves, gently speak to bat and cover w towel, release outside. Gentle voice works wonders, I've heard.
