@JamesBradySBN Anderson has that triceps injury, I expect him to be NFI this season. Will be interesting to see who's spot Bell takes.
@BetterRivals @in4td As an Oregon fan, I was concerned I missed something historic!!
@in4td @BetterRivals right. Do you remember a game they full on changed uniforms? I can't imagine there is enough time for that in game.
@tony_gt_500 I'm not saying I disapprove, but we can't claim we won SBs with integrity. If you ain't cheatin' you ain't winnin'
@tony_gt_500 dude, they were accused of using IR to stash players, and interfering with the opponents headsets.
.@BetterRivals They did have a uniform for the Fiesta Bowl in 2013 that was supposed to change color once the sun went down.
.@BetterRivals did you find the game that Oregon changed uniforms? I don't think it happened.
@JeffFarrier the difference is in the PR backlash of drafting a guy who might have been involved in a murder.
@JeffFarrier I would agree with that, but they seem to be stuck in a PR nightmare.
@grantmp1 QP with worse hands.
@JeffFarrier I just think the threat from the agent combined with the uncertainty of the case was enough to scare teams away.
@JeffFarrier you lose a draft pick.
@tony_gt_500 @sugarplumjo You know that Bill Walsh was accused of cheating in several ways, right?
@JeffFarrier @davidneumann_ His agent said he wouldn't sign with a team if he was selected after round 3, and enter draft next year.
@49ersHub @davidneumann_ yeah, well, it's not really tricking people anymore.
@49ersHub @davidneumann_ what would we gain on a wildcat play that we don't already have with Kap?
@grantmp1 nm, I see it
@grantmp1 are you going to share some of them?
@49ersGab @sfbaydrummer @49ersHub I bet, Blake Bell is gonna be on the roster and active every because he can be emergency QB.
@49ersGab @sfbaydrummer @49ersHub I think Busta ends up on NFI for the year with that triceps injury
@ilprincipals except that it isn't a standardized test, it's a formative test.
.@49ersGab Not only is Kap at least an above average starter, but he has a nice team friendly deal
@49ersGab Nope. So hard to find a starting QB, Kap's pretty good.
@in4td so I think there will be room for 1 UFDA WR. My money is on Dres Anderson, he's smooth and will get open. But those hands...ugh.
@in4td yeah, the last game he played in was vs Georgia 11/29/14
@in4td If he misses all of camp and the first couple games, it will be tough for him to play at all this season.
@in4td He tore his ACL the end of November, can't imagine he's ready for the start of the season
@in4td Smelter is gonna be on the NFI for most if not all of the year IMO.
@in4td I think Simpson is the on WR in danger. The other two were drafted. #ego
@ChrisBiderman clay for Henry to mold. It will be very interesting to see who sticks on the roster or practice squad.
I see Baalke has a new WR strategy, sign them all. 
.@adamwolfgang Plus Ward at nickel, Ellington at returner/3rd WR and Borland would have started.
Potentially 5 starters from the 2014 draft this year. Hyde, Martin, Thomas, Johnon, and Lynch. 
@monstr77 well, there may be money involved in the Hardy incident.
@monstr77 most victims don't want to testify.
@monstr77 the eye witness accounts weren't during the attack, so the only testimony that counts is from the victim.
@monstr77 so f'd up
@KenMartin44 @49ersHub #Vintage
@KenMartin44 @49ersHub California is serious about their iPhones
@49ersGab @Buddy_Boy69 the player is more important than the position. I thought a guy like Parker or DGB would make a difference in RZ
@Tre9er that will be so fun!
@49ersHub good athlete, bad hands
@Tre9er I think it's more about getting Sporano the guys he wants.
@JamesBradySBN longest arms ever.
@NinersNation 34" arms!!
@MaioccoCSN 34" arms
@EddieTheCommish ha! we are a soccer family, all my kids play and my wife played in college.
@EddieTheCommish yep, it's not been a good season. I actually spend more time watching our women's team, my wife has season tickets.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er Yep, sitting in the Timbers Army
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er I'm hydrating. Heading to an MLS game this evening, probably pound some beers there.
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er a punter, from the looks of it, who can play TE
.@Tre9er what the heck happened? I went to coach a soccer game and come back to a punter.
@BetterRivals Blake Bell, I like it!
@NinersNation O-line?
Chiefs took Marcus Peters AND Steven Nelson? Can we have Marcus Cooper back?
@Tre9er Terrence McGee from LSU
@Tre9er @dutytime22 @9ersEv My understanding is that he only tore his ACL, no MCL damage.
@Tre9er @dutytime22 @9ersEv He didn't really have a good season  before his injury, was out played by Troy Hill most of the time.
@dutytime22 @9ersEv @Tre9er Always thought he wasn't more than a 4th round pick with the injury.
@dutytime22 @9ersEv @Tre9er yeah, I haven't heard that the knee is worse than a standard ACL. Will probably miss the season though.
@Tre9er He destroyed Ohio St. too
@chazk802 @KevinMolina85 @agchee OLB Eli Harold from Virgina. Great pick!!
@KevinMolina85 @chazk802 @agchee Niners like a guy in the 6-7 round range, Terrence McGee from LSU
love it, he's better than Lemonier IMO 
@chazk802 @KevinMolina85 yeah, like that pick a lot!
@49ersHub how many volts?
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er yeah, odd that he is there.
@Tre9er thanks, 5 hours of makeup everyday.
@Tre9er I know. I'm just being sassy.
@Tre9er yes, more d-line.
@9ersEv Smelter from Ga Tech or Tre Mcbride from William &amp; Mary
@Tre9er I hate that pick. Wish he went  to an AFC team.
@in4td Strong to Texans
@SoCaliSteph @Tre9er did he offer you the signed robe pic too!!!??
@Tre9er Roman Candle involved somehow and I'm in.
@Tre9er what do I get if I stay?
@MRHawkins49 don't forget the guns!!!
@Hot_Route @Tre9er Nope!
@MRHawkins49 You win!
@SoCaliSteph I was disappointed too, but once DGB was gone I lost all ability to give fucks.
@Tre9er #SelfHelp
@DAdeshiyan I might be more worried about ARI than SEA next couple seasons.
@DAdeshiyan yep, that sucks.
@SoCaliSteph @Tre9er because now that Harbs is gone we want everyone to be BFFs
@AllbrightNFL don't like Strong at all, wouldn't draft him even in round 7.
@Cianaf you should see this, #21 
@Michael_RA @Tre9er good call.
@joewilka @Tre9er yep, I'm happy as Icky Woods with some cold cuts.
@Michael_RA @Tre9er O delish! I'm in Portland, the Deschutes brewery downtown is divine!
@9ersEv @Tre9er yes, we died. Though I think Ward would be better to replace Reid if he goes down. Tartt will replace Bethea next year.
@Michael_RA @Tre9er what kind of beer?
@joewilka @Tre9er get it. I'm 4 deep, I need some water or I wont remember the 3rd round.
@49ersGab I love it, will be great on ST this year. Plus his name is fun to say.
@KenMartin44 and I don't think we get a speed WR. I think we get a guy who we groom to take over for Boldin. Smelter maybe.
@Tre9er I'm feeling good about Tartt. But I've had several whiskeys.
@KenMartin44 I don't think we take an ILB till late, maybe UDFA, too many guys on the roster, maybe more than CB.
@timmay_111 @SoCaliSteph haha, I just had to poke you on this. :)
@KenMartin44 right, only one. And maybe Ifo from Oregon cause he won't play this year.
@timmay_111 @SoCaliSteph @49ers I HOPE they take Strong, he sucks.
@KenMartin44 some really good CBs late 3rd through the 4th.
@SoCaliSteph Grady Jarrett or Tyler Lockett.
please, someone take Grady Jarrett before Seattle can.
@StellaLibretto haha, or an exquisite exotic jeweled gold chain.
@MRHawkins49 Ifo and Collins in the 4th. Done.
@MRHawkins49 haha, I think teams are pissed at Gregory for his attitude. I bet Collins round 3.
@EddieTheCommish @BigSwinginNick and don't forget Reaser is a 4.3 guy
@AJGullotta @SoCaliSteph Tartt is the kind of guy you want to have in the NFC west, especially vs Seattle. He will kill Russell.
@EddieTheCommish @BigSwinginNick I really like Acker, he played so well in preseason and had a broken foot.
@SoCaliSteph yeah, that's a good point. Maybe he takes over for Eric Reid when he retires early due to concussions. FML, I need more whiskey
@EddieTheCommish @BigSwinginNick well for sure Brandon Thomas, but who else are you referring to?
who gets picked first? Gregory or La'el Collins?
@EddieTheCommish @BigSwinginNick Haven't found safetys that can play safety in later rounds, only CBs.
@EddieTheCommish @BigSwinginNick or next year...Also, big hitter on ST which can swing some momentum in games.
I'm in a glass booth of emotion 
@EddieTheCommish @BigSwinginNick A better Goldson.
@SoCaliSteph no, no. Ward staying at Nickelback
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er agreed. Shallow safety draft, gotta take em' early.
Jaquiski Tartt 
@Tre9er I like it. Guess it means Ward stays at CB.
@NinersNation yeah, sorry.
@Tre9er holy crap
@NinersNation Tartt from Stanford
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er Baalke gonna take the 5'10" 34 year old long snapper?
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er right, maybe that's the entire reason he picked Armstead, to throw off the rest of the draft!
@Michael_RA or Gregory.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er except that he picked the one guy everyone thought he would in round 1
@Michael_RA I tend to think we go defense again in round 2, DB maybe.
Are we gonna take Randy Gregory?
@Michael_RA I just have the feeling we are looking at a late WR for Boldin to groom as his replacement. Smelter maybe.
@Tre9er no CBs have gone yet
@MockingTheDraft or no one wants him because he runs crap routes and can't get off press.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 &lt;sarcasm&gt; And Baalke has shown he can find offensive players late in the draft &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er still feel its not gonna be a WR. More defense.
@Tre9er Coates is SOOOO Baalke.
@chazk802 Niners haven't picked yet, but all the WR are gone. Smith, DGB, Funchess, gone.
@Tre9er WR run
Funchess to Carolina? Seriously?
@in4td GAH!!
@Tre9er its kind of a bad situation, locker room that isn't stable and a rookie QB
@SoCaliSteph BUT WAIT!!! 
@Tre9er Or McBride
@Tre9er I'm all in on Smelter now.
@greebs @Tre9er I don't think we are taking a WR in this round.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er yes, a bit of a surprise. He's the same kind of player as Justin Hunter I think.
@in4td wow, didn't hear that. Not sure he goes till 4th. Wont play at all this season.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er yeah, I didn't expect we would get him. Sucks.
@Tre9er DGB gone to TEN
@in4td too early for Ducks DBs. Could be Tartt the safety from Stanford or one of the CBs from Florida St.
@in4td I heard it's going to be a DB
@in4td probably. I'd rather they get picked before us, than have us pass on them.
.@Tre9er dang, Jets got Devin Smith
@Tre9er ugh, good choice
@Tre9er did you figure out who is breaking the picks?
@Tre9er have no idea. Saw Ian Kenyon react to it
@monstr77 when is he not
@chazk802 @I_am_YouGoMango Yeah, no problem!
@DK_England maybe. It certainly shows that one of those guys is seen as a backup and not a starter.
@DK_England I'm a Ducks fan, I am not looking forward to dealing with the frustration that goes with watching him.
@DK_England well...@Tre9er has convinced me to take the high road. But I'm not crazy about it.
@DK_England yep, I did misread it. Thank you for clarifying.
@DK_England yes we do, but not day 1 guys.
@Tre9er OMG.
@Tre9er I mean, I can't imagine why anyone would call Mariota a hoe...
@Tre9er did he call Collin or Mariota a hoe?
@DK_England I don't think that is tradition. Usually our round 1 pick begins the season as a starter.
@Tre9er yeah, after I wrote that I wondered about S. Who else besides Collins? He's gonna go quick in round 2.
Marilyn Mosby is going to become a historical hero.

@Michael_RA wow, incredible
@Michael_RA Maybe it's Jed in disguise.
@Tre9er maybe it's Maybelline
Oh this is good.

@Christian_Gin ok, gotchya
@Christian_Gin 
@Christian_Gin he just tweeted that it was a joke
@greebs haha, I went round and round with him and just gave up.
@greebs oh, but wait - 
@greebs yeah, but we don't have too many needs, and the needs we have aren't huge. CB probably the most need.
@greebs @49ersHub @TheJoeMarino @Johnnyu9322 we do need a S. Reid has concussion issues and Bethea might not be back next year. no backup.
@49ersHub @greebs @TheJoeMarino @Johnnyu9322 I wonder if it's CB or S. Landon Collins still available.
@greebs I am almost bitter, wait till we don't get DGB, then I will be.
@greebs or if you are an ego maniac
@greebs I don't know if I would go so far as to say it is an admission. What if he gets a 5th or 6th round guy who becomes a starter?
@greebs @49ersHub @TheJoeMarino @Johnnyu9322 Matt Miller saying the Niners are targeting secondary in round 2.
@NinersNation I really wish they didn't use a black background on those pics, hard to see.
Secondary. I bet they like Ronald Darby and PJ Williams. 

@TIM______ like I said, I like the guy, but he's not his uncle. Yet. He has room to grow.
@TIM______ He's the owner, everything falls on him. The stadium, the handling of Harbs, all the off field legal stuff the players were in...
@BayAreaFan2 @VincentFrankNFL Isn't Armstead just a more seasoned Lawrence Okoye?
@9ersEv @VincentFrankNFL Gotchya, haha
@9ersEv @VincentFrankNFL huh? Hands?
@VincentFrankNFL Armstead will be the best 1st guy off the bus in the NFL!!
@TIM______ I kinda agreed with firing Harbs too, but that's besides the point.
@TIM______ he leaks info to the national media, and the stadium didn't turn out that well.
@TIM______ I'm not saying he's a bad owner, but he isn't great. He fired a fantastic coach because they couldn't get along.
@monstr77 @49ersGab uh, I hope not.
@49ersGab Tomsula probably picked him for Tomsula.
@TIM______ I have backed Jed up publicly time after time in spite of the dumb things he does. So for you to call me a "fan" was funny too
@TIM______ I'm laughing at the hashtag. I don't dislike Jed, but he is not a great owner.
HAHAHA!!! 
@monstr77 probably a good guess
@monstr77 I'm trying so hard not to get my hopes up. I kinda think he will be gone by 14.
@PandaKANG9 the wild card is that he is one of Baalke's favorite players on the team, not sure if that makes a difference or not.
@monstr77 they could make some people happy with Devin Smith or J Strong
@monstr77 splashy is what got them Johnny football
@monstr77 do you think the FO feels they need a splashy pick?
@davidneumann_ Ok, then I'll leave my questions for later...thanks!
@monstr77 HAHA, after the off field stuff of Jonny football and Gordon? No way.
@davidneumann_ are you writing an article?
@davidneumann_ well he did in most games. Did you watch the FSU game? I thought that was his best tape. I thought he looked lost vs OSU
@davidneumann_ you don't think he could 2 gap on some run plays right now?
@PandaKANG9 maybe, not sure what to think about that.
@Kyle_McLorgBASG funny, but even I wouldn't call it that and I hate the Armstead pick. Remember we got 2 picks in a trade back.
@PandaKANG9 yeah, Jake Fisher as a swing tackle/future Staley replacement would make sense.
@PandaKANG9 well, that's who I want! but not sure FO feels the same way. Could be another D pick. Safety, CB, ILB, or edge rusher.
@PandaKANG9 I would think a trade up is the way to go if they target one guy.
@PandaKANG9 he and Dial are so big they could occupy 4 blockers by themselves. That's a positive.
@PandaKANG9 I really like that we moved back and got 2 picks. Still some great talent on the board too.
@PandaKANG9 I hope I'm wrong.
@PandaKANG9 I don't think he can play across the line, only on strong side IMO. Dont think he offers much as PR in nickel either.
@PandaKANG9 yeah, I think there are some fundamental differences though. Aldon had some super great natural instincts
@PandaKANG9 I think the thing they like about him is game plan versatility. He can 1gap or 2gap. His tape vs FSU is really good.
@PandaKANG9 I wasn't happy last night and into this morning, I'm still very skeptical, but I re-watched some film and I'm more optimistic.
@timmay_111 @grantmp1 maybe so.
Played mostly on strong side at Oregon. 
@ChrisBiderman That link brings up a blank page for me.
@49ersOnScout that link is a blank page, FYI.
@monstr77 @timmay_111 @BetterRivals and they could have been concerned Armstead would be picked by someone else, they really wanted him
@Alonso7349 @BetterRivals @timmay_111 that's a late night. I started work at 5am!
@chazk802 maybe. I would have been super excited with Peters in round 1, or an o-lineman. I'm not sold WR in round 2. Baalke could stay on D
@Alonso7349 @BetterRivals @timmay_111 oh wait, you were talking to Oscar...that makes more sense!!
@Alonso7349 @BetterRivals @timmay_111 I'm still learning, but I love to share what I learn. Thanks!
@chazk802 I would have hated half and loved half. I will warm up to Armstead, but I didn't want him 24 hours ago.
@joshuamcfadden2 @Tre9er right over the tackle. But more important, what is his gap responsibility. AA can 1gap or 2gap.
@BetterRivals @timmay_111 I think Baalke talking about him being 4-tech was revealing. Can change game plan from 1-gap to 2-gap game to game
@NFLguy07840 @MRHawkins49 and after watching more tape this morning, I think Armstead can play right away in base-D on running downs.
@NFLguy07840 @MRHawkins49 I agree, but our team has solid players, not many rookies gonna play right away unless injury.
@BetterRivals Vs OSU he doesn't look as good because he's 2 gapping, holding blockers. This is why the Niners want him, he's versatile
@BetterRivals I just re-watched some tape. Vs FSU he played really well shooting through gaps and being disruptive.
@MRHawkins49 that's true. I'm calming down.
@Tre9er watch Armstead's tape vs FSU, he played really well in that game, shot gaps and was aggressive.
@TheCoachEdwards @FootballScoop oh that's right, I forgot about that, good call.
@MRHawkins49 @NFLguy07840 His tape vs FSU (who had 3 NFL prospects on the Oline) was really good. Vs OSU was average.
@MRHawkins49 @NFLguy07840 However, he brings versatility. Played 1-gap vs FSU, and 2-gap vs OSU. Not many DL guys can do both well.
@MRHawkins49 @NFLguy07840 The difference between Armstead and Aldon is that Aldon showed great natural instincts at Missouri. Armstead - not
@chazk802 upside is all he has IMO. He and Dial make for a HUGE pair on the d-line though.
@FootballScoop It's probably a money/consistency thing. To easy to confuse teams if helmets change, and not many buy helmets.
@chazk802 Ok, he looks much better vs FSU. And I kinda see why thy like him. Played 1-gap vs FSU, played 2-gap vs OSU. Versatility.
@NinersNation @BetterRivals @MEZTER hard to interpret that.
@NinersNation @BetterRivals @MEZTER 
@NinersNation @BetterRivals @MEZTER He tweeted it, but I thought he was only talking about round 1.
@chazk802 I didn't think he was very impressive vs OSU. Was only involved in a handful of plays. Re-watching the FSU tape now.
@MathsAnderson @Tre9er @Notorious_JMT @NinersNation @BetterRivals NFL rules prohibit alternate helmet.
But what REALLY sticks out on the tape vs Texas is RB Malcom Brown. Tore Oregon up.
Watched him play vs Texas in 2013, he can hold point pretty well and occupy two blockers.
After watching some more tape on Armstead, I think he will have some success right away 2-gapping just using his length.
@FootballScoop the NFL doesn't allow alternate helmets.
@DAdeshiyan right, that's what I mean.
@DAdeshiyan yeah, I'm trying not to get my hopes up on DGB. If we get him I will buy a jersey tonight.
@BetterRivals I like Devin Smith a lot too. Plus there are some solid CBs on the board in round 2 as well.
@DAdeshiyan the only silver lining for me is that there are still some really good players on the board for round 2. Fingers crossed.
@DAdeshiyan &lt;sigh&gt; me too. I started to watch more tape this morning, had to turn it off because it was making me mad.
@Tre9er @Notorious_JMT @NinersNation @BetterRivals yeah, that's nice
@Tre9er kinda makes me think the new scheme will be fairly complex, which makes sense with what we know of Mangini.
@Tre9er I was thinking that too. Interesting stuff.
@Tre9er yeah, I don't care about that. I find it really interesting when he talks about fit with scheme. He is good at finding those guys.
@Tre9er but he specifically called this role a 2-gap player
@Tre9er he went out of his way to talk about how there aren't many players each year they feel can play a 4-tech role consistently.
@Tre9er Baalke seems to think it's more than nuances. " In any given draft, there’s four or five [4-techs]"
@Tre9er I understand where a 4tech lines up, inside of tackle shoulder. And from Baalke it sounds like a 2 gap guy.
.@Tre9er so talk scheme with me for a second. Baalke called Armstead a 4tech guy. I thought we ran a 5tech and a 3tech. What is a 4tech?
@BetterRivals Baalke said this about 4-tech "True four techniques, guys that can two gap..."
@Tre9er @njninerfan499 
Ok, here's a positive thought. If the coaches can make Armstead a capable starter, I will think very highly of them.
@Tre9er &lt;sigh&gt; guess I will follow your lead...
@MRHawkins49 It's less his tape and play that concern me, it's his football personality that concerns me
@MRHawkins49 "...and I don't know if he has the personality or instincts to seize that opportunity."
@MRHawkins49 from an Oregon beat writer: "Simply put, Armstead has a long way to go to become a dominant defender..."
@Tre9er yeah, I'm watching tape today, but misery loves company
@MRHawkins49 he just seems to always move in the wrong direction, no instincts
@Tre9er NO, where is the old Tre...
@MRHawkins49 as a ducks fan, I have only been disappointed by him.I'm gonna have to watch some tape.
@MRHawkins49 I'm not getting my hopes up. I want him so badly.
@NinersNation Here is what the Oregonian said about Armstead 
@TIM______ @Tre9er I don't believe a word that comes out of Jed's mouth
@Tre9er meh
@EddieTheCommish @Tre9er I personally would have thought so, but maybe they didn't have a trade partner. Weren't many trades in rd 1
@BetterRivals two gap? A and B?
@Tre9er fleeced the LA Chargers
@ChrisBiderman what the hell is a 4-tech?
@RonRsoratos @in4td oh yes
@in4td @RonRsoratos I need more whiskey
@Tre9er I dare Baalke to trade up for DGB, right now.
@in4td @RonRsoratos Ugh.
@in4td @rebdab but he really didn't hold his edge in the run game. Felt like RBs moved into space he just vacated all season.
@49ersGab maybe...I kinda think Armstead is gone after year 3
@greebs @thefootballgirl ugh
@greebs @thefootballgirl my wife asked me why I was crying.
@in4td told me what? I didn't think we would get DGB, I just didn't want Armstead.
@Tre9er sad panda
OMG
@49ersHub If Parker is available and we still take Armstead, I'm gonna rage quit.
@Tre9er Got my Roman Candles ready.
@NinersNation did you get spicy? I hope you got spicy...
Alright @Tre9er, here is the lineup: Hopworks IPX, Hopvalley Citrus Mistress, Portland SMASH, Break side (cont) 


@GafflezMalone oh, I am. Size does matter.
@GafflezMalone that is a hard question because we don't know who will be available. I want a good WR though.
@JamesBradySBN Jed?
@GafflezMalone I'm a big Oregon fan, I don't like the way he plays mentally and emotionally. Should be an OT
@GafflezMalone gross.
@Tre9er Matching heels and a clutch?
@Michael_RA @Tre9er @DreSmithJr @mikeveirs since I bought one bedazzler and got a second for free, I can afford the fine.
@Tre9er @DreSmithJr @mikeveirs The players can always bedazzle it...
@Tre9er apparently NFL rules state that teams can not change their helmet. H/T @49ersHub
@Tre9er like a Harbaugh silhouette?
@monstr77 maybe, I saw that Boone has said he's willing to be traded. He just wants to get paid and knows he won't get it from Niners
@NFLguy07840 can't even really see it yet.
@NinersNation @MaioccoCSN I wonder how loud he screamed when he noticed
@49ersHub I had no idea. Poor Nike, they love f'ing with helmets.
@49ersHub oh, interesting.
@MRHawkins49 different type of speed than Ellington too.
@49ersHub I was hoping for an alternate helmet.
@MRHawkins49 I forgot about that, like it even more. Diggs is a good compliment to our current stable IMO.
@MRHawkins49 that's a good observation.
@MRHawkins49 but I'm not sure we will carry 6-7 WRs. Team moves on from Patton?
@MRHawkins49 I could get behind those picks
@49ersHub wow, I'm kinda shocked both those guys fell to the 3rd.
@greebs Baalke's counter is that WR is very deep and we can get a starting WR in 2nd or 3rd round. But trading to 4 will cost a 2nd and 3rd
@monstr77 could be a player involved
@monstr77 I would think a trade to #4 would be very expensive
@monstr77 yeah, and could add quality CB in later rounds depending on how much they give up.
@greebs right, Parker could be had later unless there are no other trade partners. I've heard the trade to Oak would be for Leonard Williams
@monstr77 that would be a BOLD move. He's an incredible player.
Hmm...Cooper or White? 
@Woods49ers @monstr77 especially since his absence isn't directly tied to a hold out at this point.
@Woods49ers @monstr77 Boone is one of Baalke's favorite players, I would be surprised if he is traded.
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source FWIW, I don't think the Niners are going to take DGB because of the PR nightmare.
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source I see a guy with great size who has enough wiggle to be a good after the catch threat
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source I see a guy who has a HUGE body and was able to get behind faster players for deep passes
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source I saw a guy who didn't have a great QB, and many of the 50/50 throws weren't good throws.
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source I saw a guy who uses size well and has good body control. Calvin Johnson doesn't win all his 50/50 balls
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source early in 2013 he relied on athleticism and wasn't as dominant. But he learned as the season went on how to play
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source nope, I only watched game tape of DGB
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source I'm not sure what you are watching. 
@monstr77 @49ers_Source @timmay_111 On tape DGB can't be covered, especially at the end of the 2013 season.
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 ok, ok, I'm done with the AJ talk ;)
@monstr77 @49ers_Source @timmay_111 I only based my opinion on what I saw on tape. He looks transcendent to me.
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source Good CBs just pushed him out of bounds on outside routes. The only thing he has going for him is strong hands.
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source AJ Jenkins had good numbers too. Strong runs shit routes and can't beat press coverage, or any coverage really.
@49ers_Source @monstr77 @timmay_111 it depends on the background work. He is a top 15 talent.
@timmay_111 @49ers_Source Jalen Strong is horrible, just horrible.
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 and that's my point with Parker vs DGB. DGB needs some coaching, but has things you cant teach. The "IT" IMO.
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 I can't wait!!
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 We don't need a WR who can come in and start day 1, which is why I take the potential
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 I really like Parker, a ton. DGB has a higher ceiling, could be the best player in the draft in 5 years.
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 the "he beats women" statement isn't true. He was accused of pushing a woman downs some stairs but never charged
@49ers_Source DGB is so much bigger than Parker and I think he's a more fluid athlete, more natural talent
@49ers_Source I agree that Parker is more polished, which is why I like DGB more. He beat people even though he doesn't know what he's doing
@KenMartin44 @in4td @Tre9er @JosephHColley That wouldn't surprise me
@in4td @Tre9er @JosephHColley I agree with that, I don't think DGB is that guy
@49ers_Source I do not agree with this statement.
@in4td @Tre9er @JosephHColley I believe DGB's off field issues are vastly overstated.
.@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick great podcast last night. Did you see that Chris Cook is running with the 1's early in mini-camp?
HAHAHAHAHA!! 
@in4td @Tre9er yes, ask KFC.
@in4td @Tre9er oh man, fried chicken from a little hole in the wall place I know. Chicken comes in a cardboard box, it's the best.
@49ersGab @JosephHColley prediction: Arik Armstead will flame out after 3 seasons, sign with a new team and move to OT.
@Tre9er fried chicken, hot sauce, several craft beers. I will send you the beer lineup when I buy it this afternoon.
@rebdab I hope so. Baalke seems to put a premium on trench players, likes to get skill guys later
@rebdab I would also be happy with CB Marcus Peters, think he fits our style very well.
@rebdab was posted about 2 weeks ago.
@rebdab that year off was so good for DGB and maybe why I'm comfortable taking him considering his off field issues.
@rebdab If you have time, read this 
@rebdab in 2013 DGB dominated, especially in the last few games, yet he has no idea what he's doing running routes
@rebdab I like Parker a lot, he is a safer pick than DGB. I'm in love with DGB's ceiling.
@rebdab but if we get Armstead at 15 I will need a quick run to the liquor store for an emergency bottle of whiskey.
.@rebdab Tre is in for a victory lap if we get DGB too! 
@rebdab yes, I think we could trade back maybe 4 picks and still get him, but I wouldn't risk it. He's my crush.
@rebdab but if we draft Dorial Green-Beckham, I will run around the neighborhood screaming.
@rebdab no clue, Baalke is unpredictable. Could trade up, could trade back, could stand pat.
@rebdab oh man, I couldn't even sleep last night! #goniners
@Jmpasq or that he can even play guard.
@bennett_tristan @49ersHub they don't know if he is involved, he is not a suspect - yet. Too much unknown.
@bennett_tristan @49ersHub yeah, the police must be in on it.
@greebs @49ersHub this is a DEEP RB draft too
@bennett_tristan @49ersHub I don't believe the stuff about Ray or Gregory will change their value much, but Collins is in it deep.
@bennett_tristan @49ersHub usually I would think so, but this situation feels different to me. No one wants to be involved in a murder case
@bennett_tristan @49ersHub I don't know. Maiocco seems to think teams are taking him off their board
@49ersHub @bennett_tristan Collins might not be draftable after the issue that happened today.
@49ersHub I don't think the Niner FO would live through drafting Collins in round 1. Maybe round 3.
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er an all black alternate would be pretty bad ass too
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er our shade of red (crimson) would be better
@AJGullotta @in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er I'm in for gold, would be very unique
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er oh man, all red with gold stripes and a gold helmet. I'd love it.
@floydyniner I would too, but he isn't the beefy big body Baalke likes for the edge rushers
@floydyniner yeah, It's just interesting because we had no idea who the new staff saw as the 1s.
Oh, Chris Cook running with the 1's early in camp. 
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er I kind of hope they do. I'd really like an all black or all red alternate.
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er we had silver stripes in the 50's and 60's
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er Source: The new alternate uniforms will have both pants and a jersey.
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er that's the rumor.
@in4td @NinersNation @Tre9er Source: The alternate uniforms will be different than the current home and away uniforms.
@mtokito pretty sure before the game he said it was must win for Portland. #analysis
@pinwheelempire but it's a towel with an extended vocabulary
Bwahahaha!!! 
@CHold crabby? they sound ignorant.
Way to be classy Memphis 
@rickgasko quicker release could help against preventing sacks
@Tre9er right
@Tre9er @49ersHub a coat made of seahawk feathers
@BayAreaFan2 I think he just likes money
@Tre9er I think they want it to be more aggressive, more blitzing
@VincentFrankNFL yes, announcing each batter, no music though. One player tossed a foul ball into the stands #musclememory
@49ersHub @MattHarmon_BYB Hardy was a head case, was committed to a mental health facility
@Tre9er @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd Seattle should have run that play in the Super Bowl
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er &lt;sniff&gt; I try so hard...
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er I make him hang the 49er Christmas ornament on the tree every year to shame him.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er I've tried, he latched on to the Saints when they drafted Bush years ago, according to the rules he has to stay a fan
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er it's good father son time for me and my oldest. Except that he's a Saints fan...
@Tre9er @PandaKANG9 My body is ready for the draft. Gonna get a box of delicious fried chicken and a fresh bottle of whiskey.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er I like La'el Collins as a plug in guard/future tackle.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er I just don't think CB in round 1 is Baalke's style. And I don't think the edge guys have the body type Baalke likes.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er Peters the CB from Washington, or one of the edge rushers who slips, or O-line.
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er yeah, I see that, but I think Smith is more diverse than he has shown. He had a specific role at OSU, and did it well.
@49ersGab completely agree
@PandaKANG9 @Tre9er Cooper is too much Crabtree for me. Rather trade up for Devin Smith in round 2.
@Tre9er @PandaKANG9 eww. I don't want to give up anything for Cooper. If he falls to 15 AND DGB/Parker are gone, then I'd take him.
@Tre9er @pjramey WHAAAAAAA?
@monstr77 well, @nflnetwork started it
@Tre9er @pjramey I can finally play my Milli Vanilli tape again.
@Tre9er @pjramey dude, I bought one at a garage sale last summer! Sony even!
@Tre9er @pjramey HA! I wasn't till 1980
Almost as bad as the Blazers passing on MJ for Sam Bowie 
@Tre9er @pjramey and a Roman Candle
@pjramey @Tre9er If we draft DGB I'm gonna do a victory lap around the neighborhood with an air horn.
Yes. Me too. 
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 clearly, cause his baby legs just didn't work.
@4for4_Josh what about for a good game pat on the backside?
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 still funny. I'm gonna make my kids act this out in the back yard when I get home.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 the more I watch it the funnier it gets
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 I'm not saying I don't like Golson, I do, but that's funny right there
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 Ha, #21 Golson juked out of his shoes by Trent Richardson, twice on one play 
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick only if all the players are selected by 15, then I say trade it.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 In most of the mocks I have done with various boards on @fanspeak, 4th round has been rich.
@Tre9er woman crush Wednesday, man crush Monday
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er @chazk802 Senquez Golson in that mix too
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 so maybe I just like rounds 3 and 4.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 yeah, he could be. Depends on teams boards.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 I like OT/OG Daryl Williams and Jeremiah Poutasi in round 4 too.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 4th round is that second tier of TE's too, Heuerman and Bell.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick @chazk802 Stephen Nelson, Doran Grant, Troy Hill, Lorezno Doss. Eric Rowe &amp; Josh Shaw late 3rd possible too.
@BigSwinginNick @chazk802 I really love the CBs in round 4. In fact, I would love to have 3 picks in round 4, gonna be some good value there
@BigSwinginNick oh right, he's in Carolina now. So Pears is our 3rd tackle. Even more reason to draft one!
@BigSwinginNick did we release him and I missed it? Then who is T heading into the season? Pears?
@BigSwinginNick @chazk802 yes ILB in round two is the sweet spot, but 15 might be too late to get Anthony or Dawson.
@BigSwinginNick @chazk802 I do really like the Peters pick in round 1 as well.
@BigSwinginNick @chazk802 I agree. I'm head over heels for DGB though. I would take him at 15, but better to trade back.
@BigSwinginNick right, I just don't want another season of JMart.
@chazk802 @BigSwinginNick yeah, me too, which worries me. Coates is Ted Ginn all over again. I'd rather get a WR in round 1 or 2
@BigSwinginNick I really like Sambrailo as a poor man Joe Staley
@BigSwinginNick depends on who's available, of course. I like OL in round 3, maybe a tackle like Havenstein, Sambrailo or Thompson.
@BigSwinginNick @NinersNation I have to say, I'd rather have several other WRs in round 3 than Coates
@NinersNation @BigSwinginNick Love the Bobby Richardson pick. He's a little under the radar because he's not mountain sized.
@MattHarmon_BYB I didn't have to read past #1 to agree with you. #swoon
@monstr77 plus, I think Dawson from TCU fits better in our scheme
@monstr77 yeah, I still don't like the idea of ILB as high as round 2. We have two starters already.
@monstr77 taking an ILB in round 1 is slightly behind picking Armstead for worst scenario in my opinion.
Oh, this is good... 
HAHA!! 
@NinersNation He's gonna have Perriman going top 25 in his mock tonight, I just feel it.
@monstr77 @Tre9er man, who knows. I hope not. I don't think we are in need of ILB as much as others. We need depth IMO.
@Tre9er and as you know, having a kid changes EVERYTHING
@Tre9er yeah, it may only be one perspective, though I have heard he has been a different guy at OK. His Brother is helping him.
@Notorious_JMT Okoye is probably more athletic than Armstead too
@Notorious_JMT we already have an Armstead project type on the roster in Okoye
@Notorious_JMT I will say this for him, he's VERY raw. Was a basketball player first until last year. But I don't want a project at 15.
@Notorious_JMT I'm a huge Ducks fan. I've watched him play a lot. He looks average at times vs inferior competition. No fire.
@Notorious_JMT I completely agree. Armstead seems like he will flame out and move to OT in 3 years as a last ditch effort.
@Tre9er ugh, sorry, B/R - 
@Notorious_JMT @Tre9er @CDM49er @NinersNation @BetterRivals ugh, I will need an emergency bottle of whiskey for that scenario.
@Tre9er @CDM49er @NinersNation @BetterRivals did you read that BGR special article on DGB? It was really good.
@Tre9er @CDM49er @NinersNation @BetterRivals Did you see Maiocco's list of 10 potential picks at 15? no DGB on the list.
@Tre9er @AJGullotta @grantmp1 Also, I have read that Boone is one of Baalke's favorite players.
@Tre9er @AJGullotta @grantmp1 I hope Baalke drafts a guard and a tackle. We desperately need a swing tackle.
@MaioccoCSN Interesting that Dorial Green-Beckham is not on this list. Do you know something about how the Niners feel regarding him?
@VincentFrankNFL @chazk802 yeah, not a 1st and 2nd. But in the right situation at 15 I might give up a 1st.
@chazk802 @VincentFrankNFL I'm interested, he's a very good player.
@monstr77 @VincentFrankNFL @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd @49ers Richardson or Wilkerson? I'd make that trade if Parker/White/Cooper are gone at 15.
Oh, my draft crush has a promise from the Texans at 16? 
@Tre9er the cost to move up that high is so rich, no thanks.
@49ers_Source I think a trade up is a pipe dream, those top 10 picks are VERY valuable.
@49ers_Source always thought the highest they could get was 6. If they want one of the top 3 WR, they have to go up.
I feel it is more important for the Niners to get a swing tackle than a starting guard. 
.@Dame_Lillard @CJMcCollum @MeyersLeonard11 It was a pleasure to watch you play last night. Your enthusiasm isn't lost on this town.
@49ersHub I'd strongly consider offering a 1st for him. If they would take less than a 1st, I'd run to NY.
@49ersHub oh man, he is so good. I hope the Niners are in on those discussions.
@Tre9er good for you!
@Tre9er your brews are getting better
@Tre9er @49ersHub Jordan Phillips, Phillip Phillips, Home, Home field, Levi's stadium, Niners are drafting Jordan Phillips
@Tre9er @49ersHub or if you want to go with the number theme, use Milli Vanilli - Baby Don't Forget My Number
@Tre9er @49ersHub Phil Collins wasn't in The Police...He was in Genesis. Sting was in The Police.

@49ersHub I don't like Armstead one bit, and I'm a huge Ducks fan. Wouldn't be surprised if he ends up being switched to OT.
@49ersHub maybe more, I think Okoye might be more athletic.
@monstr77 @49ersHub don't we already have an Armstead type on the roster in Lawrence Okoye?
@monstr77 @49ersHub exactly. There are 14-15 1st round graded prospects, you don't take the boom/bust guy at 15, not at DE at least.
@49ersHub I can see them going with Shelton if he's available, but he has much more diversity. Baalke values diversity.
@SakamotoRyan wow.
@49ersHub any writer mocking Armstead to Niners seems out of touch with reality to me. The people closest to the team are saying otherwise
@SakamotoRyan Where did DGB end up in that mock?
@49ersHub is he a Niners beat guy for ESPN, or does he cover the entire NFC West?
@chazk802 @Tre9er no clue who Baalke likes. But he has shown he will go up and get the player he loves. The cost to go up to 6 though...ugh
@chazk802 @Tre9er I'd really love to get Parker or DGB.
@chazk802 @Tre9er dude. This site will change your life and suck your time. 
@chazk802 @Tre9er he does run crisp routes, and catches with his hands well on tape. I'm not as high on him as others.
@chazk802 @Tre9er Hardy played a LOT from the slot vs nickel CBs. Didn't fight press much, almost always had room to catch.
@chazk802 @Tre9er I like Hardy's fight, but I'm not sure he can play outside, not sure he has the speed/quickness to beat tight man cov.
@chazk802 @Tre9er Hardy had a miserable senior bowl, dropped passes left and right, didn't show a good catch radius.
@chazk802 @Tre9er uh, no. OBJ is an athletic freak. Hardy is a hard worker, more like Boldin/Jarvis Landry IMO.
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan wouldn't shock me either
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan I like Walford, but I don't think Baalke is going to invest that high in a TE. We have like 8 on the roster.
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er doesnt worry me at all, could be smoke screen too.
.@Tre9er Uh oh... 
@Tre9er good for you! Stock up!
@monstr77 @Woods49ers He's a 3-4 OLB
@49ersHub @Woods49ers as an Oregon fan, I don't think I could watch Armstead again. He's so frustrating, should be better than he shows.
@monstr77 if OAK moves to LA there are no more problems with violence.
@monstr77 which is why it won't happen. If it did though, one of them would move to NFC, probably Raiders switch with Seattle
@rickgasko @grantmp1 @footballbruce My grass stays so green it grows moss, no joke. #portlandproblems
@49ersGab I agree with you, but I think it's possible 4 WRs go in top 15, which is crazy.
@49ersGab The Bears are interesting to me, I don't think they go NT. Give Fangio a folding chair at NT and he will have a top defense.
@49ersGab those teams could have Cooper or White #2-3 on their board.
@49ersGab Titans, Raiders, Jets, Bears, Rams, Vikings, Browns could all go WR depending on their board.
@BigSwinginNick and Waynes/Peters are likely to be picked higher than they are graded.
@49ersGab best case scenario, 1 of the top 3 WRs and 1-2 of the top EDGE players drop to 15. #tradeback
@49ersGab the O-line is the unpredictable position to me, they always go higher than we think they will. CB possibly too.
@49ersGab right, maybe top 12, but yes I think he's gone by 15. The success of rookie WRs last year will be a trend that convinces GMs IMO
@49ersGab nope, Parker is better, but I think he goes top 10.
@SakamotoRyan @EASTBAYDFRESH uh, he was in Dallas today meeting with coaches.
@49ersGab which is why 15 is a good spot to be. Someone in the top 14 picks will take a player outside of those 15ish 1st round talents.
@49ersGab most I've seen have about 15 graded as 1st rounders
@chazk802 @DAdeshiyan hopefully his reputation doesn't factor in his draft choices :)
@chazk802 @DAdeshiyan and, Baalke almost has to hit on a WR for the sake of his ego/reputation
@chazk802 @DAdeshiyan I just think Baalke philosophically doesn't invest as highly in CB as he does in lineman.
@DAdeshiyan @chazk802 I agree, especially since I think we have more young talent at CB currently on the roster.
@chazk802 I'm prepared for round 1 to be an edge guy or OL. I just think it's foolish to pass up the talent at WR in round 1.
@grantmp1 yeah, I hear that.
@BetterRivals @davidneumann_ I made it to the end! #metacognition #goniners
@chazk802 I'm not trying to say that I think the Niners will or should draft DGB, but I really like his potential.
@chazk802 I don't think CB in round 1 will happen, not Baalke's style. Edge guy makes sense, depends on who is available.
Ok, DGB is my draft crush, especially after reading this 
@BigSwinginNick Yes, that shows pretty clear on video.
@BigSwinginNick but I like Ray's tenacity and fight.
@BigSwinginNick I see them both as 4-3 OLB who can blitz. Like Von Miller or Bruce Irvin.
@BigSwinginNick you like Ray less than Eli Harold?
@BigSwinginNick why?
@49ersHub vs Chicago 11/19/2012. 3 yard pass to VD
@Tre9er did you see Barrows article about the schedule? It had some interesting notes.
@Tre9er but then again, if the new D scheme sucks and we give up 25 a game, it doesn't matter how much better Kap is.
@Tre9er much depends on Kap. If he's improved as we have heard, the sky's the limit.
@Tre9er but 6 wins wouldn't surprise anyone either. Have no idea what to expect, especially with 5 10am start times.
@Tre9er exactly.
@Tre9er I don't disagree. But we have no idea what any of these teams will actually look like yet. So predictions seem odd to me.
@Tre9er I think the schedule looks challenging at the beginning, and a little easier at the end of the season
@Tre9er I am as optimistic as the next guy, but the 11-5/10-6 predictions are hilarious to me
@WilliamsonNFL Fangio had scraps at NT in SF. Each guy played well, then left and couldn't keep a job.
@WilliamsonNFL Fangio doesn't need a top NT, I'm not a Bears fan, but I'd go WR or edge rusher.
@49ersHub no kidding, 3 of them in the last 5 games.
@monstr77 @ConnorsDoscs @49ers_Source @rebdab what article was that? Barrows?
@49ers_Source @rebdab @monstr77 Also, Parker is a red zone phenom. DGB could be good in RZ, but hasn't shown it.
@49ers_Source @rebdab @monstr77 I like DGB, he's gonna be good, but he's very raw and doesn't run routes well. Parker is polished.
@49ers_Source @rebdab @monstr77 Parker, Parker, Parker. He had 877 yards in 4 starts/6games last year with a bad QB.
@SakamotoRyan I don't think Boone was saying Harbs was a bad coach.
@49ersGab @Tre9er and now that I look, he's a little taller than I thought. Just over 5'10"
@49ersGab @Tre9er he's feisty, but short.
@49ersGab @HerbasNate 3 of the 5 had horrible play. Boone and Staley may have looked better if the other 3 were better.
@49ersGab @HerbasNate right, I agree that it was a down year. However, the line is about 5 guys working well together...
@49ersGab @HerbasNate no, I don't subscribe so I don't have the #'s. This is what I read 
@49ersGab @HerbasNate again, according to PFF, Staley finished as a top 5 T last year.
@49ersGab @cyle_maidment @EricG_SF49 But Boone called the protections once Kilgore went down
@49ersGab @cyle_maidment @EricG_SF49 It was hard for Boone to look decent playing in between JMart and the rotating centers.
@49ersGab @cyle_maidment @EricG_SF49 Boone struggled at first, he was rusty, but played well as the season went on.
@49ersGab and yet the Niners OLine was ranked 9th by PFF for last season.
@Cianaf he had 337 career carries at Oregon, that has to figure in as well.
@Cianaf I would be interested to see how many of those 27 fumbles came when he was running vs in the pocket.
@rebdab so I can, so I can...
@rebdab ha, you know that guy can't actually read, he's pretending.
@Tre9er @MadSports8 #Fridayeve
@brentsobleski yeah, so even though he may not be a fantastic NFL guard prospect, the versatility makes him very valuable as well
@brentsobleski doesn't Donnal have experience at guard too?
.@BetterRivals really thoughtful podcast, loved the depth of the discussion. I've been saying edge rusher in rnd 1 for months.
@Tre9er @nfldraftscout oh yeah, oops
According to the record books... 
@nfldraftscout this is why everyone just calls him Owa, since he was a little kid.
@Tre9er @TheJamieNeal Rogue is solid, but I'm not a huge fan of their brews
@4for4_Josh yeah, I hear that from all the fellas. I;m blessed with good genetics.
@4for4_Josh I run a 49ers draft 4 times a day on @fanspeak. I just don't care about any other teams!
@4for4_Josh @TheStreetFA oh, no. That's not me.
@4for4_Josh I follow you and not them for a reason.
@4for4_Josh haha, I'm not calling you out, I mean more the ESPN side of things. Like Jaws and this Mariota thing.
@4for4_Josh or: Draft "experts" are trying to drive ratings and clicks
@MRHawkins49 I'd be satisfied with that, but I bet there will be an OL somewhere in there.
@Tre9er @KevinMolina85 ugh, no thanks on Strong.
@AaronLemingNFL And he has some pedigree, his dad played in the NFL. I like him a lot, but not in round 1.
@AaronLemingNFL I think he changes speed really well in his routes.
@49ersHub one of the positions the Niners can go for a size speed prospect and rely on coaching.
@49ersHub Walton has huge hands, but neither one of them have Baalke freakish arm length. Check out Bobby Richardson from Indiana.
@49ersHub Leterrius Walton sounds like a character from Key &amp; Peele
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan If Baalke sees what we see in Parker, he shouldn't wait, he should trade up.
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er I think 15 is a really great spot to pick though. Someone is going to slip to 15 and make that pick more valuable.
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er yes, I meant to say a 3rd, that's what matches the trade value chart.
.@Tre9er if you could trade 15 to PHI for 20 and a 4th, but it had to be done BEFORE the draft starts or no deal, do you do it?
.@Tre9er ...one of those 14 slip to 15. Especially if it's an edge rusher or WR.
.@Tre9er Listening to the podcast. Niners should trade back 'cause there are 14 true 1st rnd players. More value later than at 15, unless...
@Tre9er I have some friends in FL, they love it.
@Tre9er It can get pretty humid in Portland, esp since we can get summer rain, but nothing like what you will get in GA.
@Tre9er My wife would love that. I would need an air conditioned bubble.
@Tre9er #sweaty
@Tre9er ugh. We usually get one week of three digit heat, I can hardly handle that.
@Tre9er yeah but July and August doe...
@49ersHub @MadSports8 @Tre9er Oh man, no Pat = all the feels
@MadSports8 @49ersHub @Tre9er I didn't fall that hard for Borland. I will cry about Pat every game this year tho
@MadSports8 @49ersHub @Tre9er my heart has healed, I'm ready to trash on it now...
@MadSports8 @49ersHub @Tre9er too soon?
@49ersHub @MadSports8 @Tre9er does that mean that after 1 podcast you are retiring from podcasting?
@SoCaliSteph @Tre9er @rickgasko Just "rent" it on Amazon - 
@Tre9er @AJGullotta @49ersHub damnit

@Tre9er but, but, but...lots of visits with WRs. I find that encouraging.
@rickgasko @SoCaliSteph @Tre9er I'm in a glass case of emotion.
@SoCaliSteph @Tre9er well, in that case, never mind
@nickpepp @Tre9er @MRHawkins49 I really love 10 Barrel, fantastic product, but now that they sold to AB I'm out.
@Tre9er @nickpepp @MRHawkins49 yeah, much different for you I'm sure. I don't have a daily drinker, too many options for that.
@SoCaliSteph @Tre9er you know I'm quoting Anchorman, right?
@Tre9er @nickpepp @MRHawkins49 My favorites are Boneyard (Bend), Deschutes (Bend), and Hopworks Urban Brewery (Portland)
@SoCaliSteph @Tre9er I think it's German actually.
@Tre9er @nickpepp @MRHawkins49 Here's a "short" list, not really a bad one in the bunch 
@Tre9er @nickpepp @MRHawkins49 there are many more too. My favorite is Boneyard, but they don't bottle anything.
@Tre9er @nickpepp @MRHawkins49 the ONE in Bend? There are at least 4 in Bend alone. 10 Barrel, Deschutes, Boneyard, and Worthy
@nickpepp @Tre9er @MRHawkins49 in Oregon we wash our hands with Sierra Nevada.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er I'm with Matt, no thanks
@Tre9er O, the Niners moving Parker to RB...

@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @DeSimone_80 He's the kind of guy who fizzles with his first team, and becomes a productive player on his second
@timlewis oh man, that's not funny.
@timlewis yep, me too.
@49ers_Source I think it says more about Crabs not wanting to come back at any cost.
@49ers_Source clearly.
@49ers_Source totally, but Nicks just  doesn't make sense to me.
@NinersNation @mockingthedraft Danny Shelton
@MRHawkins49 &lt;gasp&gt;
I just earned the 'Land of the Free (Level 5)' badge on @untappd! 
I just earned the 'Bar Explorer' badge on @untappd! 
@Tre9er so how far does he slip?
@Tre9er @NFLosophy 
@Tre9er do you know how he does it on Friday nights?
@Tre9er is Devin Funches AND Breshad Perriman in the 2nd overkill at WR? Asking for a friend...
@Tre9er @fanspeak @nfldraftscout I just got Devante Parker at 26!
@Tre9er @fanspeak @nfldraftscout whoa, talk about drama
@Tre9er I bet Baalke uses @fanspeak  to practice for draft day
@Tre9er Baalke should hire you to consult on draft day trades.
@Tre9er GET ALL THE 4TH ROUND PICKS!!
@9ersEv I was just going to tweet this!
@BigSwinginNick what are your concerns with his frame?
@BigSwinginNick I wonder if Baalke would take him if he's there at 15.
@VincentFrankNFL I wouldn't call what he did grading, he ranked them. Semantics, but makes a difference. New coaches should be last.
@VincentFrankNFL read the article. He has all the first time coaches tied for last.
@brentsobleski I'm not worried about the drops, he's a hands catcher. But, I would take DGB who is better overall IMO. and I really like BP
@Tre9er hey, you don't have to sell me :)
@Tre9er Perriman is very raw in his route running too.
@Tre9er @IanKenyonNFL it will be interesting to see which of those two gets drafted first. I know who I want...
@Tre9er and the coach who thinks he can coach Perriman to play at 4.2 speed
This RT @Tre9er: and so Kiper is vindicated for mocking Perriman to 49ers at 15 (not really, but prepare for skyrocketing media "stock")
@Tre9er bet he goes in the 1st round now. He will be over selected IMO.
@Tre9er he changes speed really well though in and out of breaks. I really like him.
@Tre9er unless he has no clue about Baalke's draft plans.
@49er_Follower yep, I've been saying this. As fun as it would be, Baalke is gonna get one of the top 5 edge rushers. I'd bet on it.
@Tre9er @NinersNation oh, I thought you were talking theoretically. I only see 4 picks so far.
@49ers_Source I think it's a 4th and a 7th.
@Tre9er @NinersNation Shane Ray gone too
@Tre9er @NinersNation Brandon Scherff
@NFLguy07840 oh, lol
@NFLguy07840 the only "elite" team they played this year was Arizona.
@Tre9er @monstr77 man, I hope you are getting a kickback for the traffic you are sending Fanspeak
@RobbyWells1 awesome!
@RobbyWells1 then the scheme needed to change. Duke and Dorsett should have won 6 games on their own.
@9ersEv yeah, we will see. I'm interested in how the coaches are going to use him.
@9ersEv me too, but 1 year at around $2.5M is palatable to me
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er yeah, I definitely don't see that, but I'm not a scout so...
@BallOut49er flew to Miami yesterday, the meeting is today.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick Also could trade up for Scherff if they think he's a home run.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick There is some value late in the draft with an athletic raw guy like Tony Washington or Lynden Trail.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick The thing about the PRs is that there is really no one else after the top 6-7 guys. Value is in those guys.
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er IF, and that's a big IF, I think it would be one of the pass rushers
@49ersHub @Tre9er Have to buy the premium version. it's pretty cheap.
@Tre9er which big board do you prefer?
@Tre9er I'm not against tons of CBs, Baalke seems to feel like there is strength in numbers. One of them will probably hit.
@Tre9er did you get a bunch of future picks?
@Tre9er yes, Borland 3rd too. I think Wilhoite can be a solid starter with Bow. But is Bow gonna be healthy?
@Tre9er HOARD ALL THE CBs!!!
@Tre9er agree. I'd draft a guy who projects to guard but has experience at OT. Jeremiah Poutasi or Daryl Williams
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er however, the roster is pretty full. We don't need tons more picks. I kinda like trading up too.
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er I think there is gonna be some really good value later in the first round too.
@Tre9er Gregory falls to 15 about 25% of the time on Fanspeak. I don't believe it.
hey, @RobbyWells1 I've been watching some tape of NFL prospects, Miami had some serious talent last year, why did they suck so bad?
@Tre9er Eli Harold from VA looks pretty good, smaller than the top 5, but really strong and you can that strengtht on tape.
@Tre9er so if QBs were taking 5-7 step drops, these guys COULD look much better
@Tre9er also, the short passing game in college has helped offenses avoid edge guys making plays. Defenses haven't completely adjusted yet
@Tre9er you want a guy who is a significant upgrade over what you have at that position already.
@Tre9er yes, especially in the top 20. You want a guy who is a starter from day 1.
@Tre9er agree, I think it's going to be a case of a position being over drafted because of the potential to change the game.
@Tre9er right. Which is why I think 2 of those top 5 will fall to 15.
@Tre9er they are all projection guys with good athleticism. 5 guys who could go top 20, but none will impact right away IMO.
@Tre9er crap, yes.
@Tre9er I really like Bud Adams, but he has the same problem, doesn't finish through tackles, uses his arms too much.
@Tre9er if he plays like he did last year, esp in preseason, this is a steal.
@Tre9er @Jason_OTC @Jay_AB81 @NinersNation gotchya
@Tre9er @Jason_OTC @Jay_AB81 @NinersNation 
@Tre9er @Jason_OTC @Jay_AB81 @NinersNation I thought I saw Jay tweet it was $1M base with some incentives.
@49ersGab I think we win some games this year simply because guys will play looser.
@CoryR49 @VincentFrankNFL @BrandonSpano I think it had more to do with owning teams in different markets.
@49ersGab also no credit for the Torrey Smith signing, who is all class
@49ersHub @timmay_111 I could see him being and exception to the Baalke norm on ILBs. Especially with his versatility
@49ersHub @timmay_111 he's versatile. Played ST too.
@timmay_111 @49ersHub Benardrick McKinney: good speed but doesn't change direction very well, but he takes on blocks well, and good blitzer
@49ersHub I like Dawson.
@49ersHub Luc looks better moving forward at the snap, unfortunately, Cincinnati used him in zone a lot and he looked lost.
@Christian_Gin Ann K really pressed that agenda
@Christian_Gin it sounds like his comments were misrepresented. He actually supports Borland.
so is Ann K gonna apologize for misrepresenting Tim Ryan's comments?
@BigSwinginNick @DAdeshiyan I wonder if Shaq Thompson could make a Bowman like change to inside. Would take a season or two.
@BigSwinginNick @DAdeshiyan I still think Baalke looks for one of the 5 edge rushers to fall to 15 and takes him. WR is so deep, value later
@BigSwinginNick @DAdeshiyan I'm not sure there is a ILB worth middle 1st consideration. Maybe late 1st.
@BigSwinginNick @DAdeshiyan he's not a guy you want to start 16 games, but can start in a pinch and play ST.
@BigSwinginNick @DAdeshiyan It is Joe Mays. He was released on March 5th by KC. Similar size to Borland.
@DAdeshiyan @BigSwinginNick wait, which ILB was released and wont count against the compensatory picks? That's the guy Baalke is calling
@BigSwinginNick exactly the kind of move I expect from Baalke. Him or Joe Mays and a draft pick.
Good for Stevie. San Diego is a great fit for him, he will do well catching passes from Phillip.
@MRHawkins49 yes, thank you. Probably planned to take a mid - late round LB anyway. This changes nothing.
@Tre9er of course, my decisions may have been on a much smaller financial scale, and weren't in a work arena I love. Difficult none the less
@Tre9er I've made decisions like this before. Given up money for well being. I do not regret those decisions.
@Tre9er I'm sure it was a very difficult decision, and all the second guessing by social media won't help. Eventually he will breathe easy.
@Tre9er I would have sacrificed pretty big for that kind of start.
@49ers_Source @in4td @nateisfinn I think Baalke will look more for a guy like Joe Mays who can start but is more a depth guy, then draft too
@Tre9er @NinersNation @StellaLibretto I've heard he's working on a cure for world hunger too.
@in4td @49ers_Source @nateisfinn I thought Maluluga resigned with CIN
@49ers_Source @nateisfinn Plus, there really aren't solid options at ILB in the first round. Maybe at the later picks, but most are early 2.
@metaljohnradio oh man, I hear that. If we can just get to the draft...
@metaljohnradio Who, Gore? They offered him a fair deal and he left anyway. He wanted more years.
@NinersNation @StellaLibretto also can't stand the "If only Harbaugh was still here..." sentiment.
@49ers_Source Baalke set this draft up to draft BPA, no glaring needs. I think he will keep it this way.
@49ers_Source @bornbadas yeah, sucks to have this conversation. Can't blame Borland though, he's got to do what's best for him.
@49ers_Source @bornbadas Then drafts one in the middle rounds.
@49ers_Source @bornbadas Wilhoite is a solid starter to pair with Bow. It all hinges on Bow. I bet Baalke signs a vet FA ILB next.
@49ers_Source @bornbadas yeah, except there aren't any middle first round rated ILBs. Draft plan largely stays the same IMO.
@yourboidillon what the hell are you talking about? Harbaugh could have prevented Borland from getting concussions?
@metaljohnradio Gore left because of the money, plain and simple. Willis and Borland are isolated incidents unrelated to head coach.
@metaljohnradio that is bull shit. This has nothing to do with Harbaugh.
@49ersGab @SeattleFaithful this has almost been Baalke's draft strategy for CBs too. Draft a bunch and see who is worth keeping.
@monstr77 They have two 1sts, a 2nd, two 3rds, and two 5ths.
@monstr77 Wouldn't be surprised if they were looking to move back for more picks.
@monstr77 I don't think NO got all those picks to move up. They need cheap players, and lots of them, esp on defense.

@49ersGab yes, Baalke has wanted speed at the offensive skill positions. Harbaugh wanted size.
@VincentFrankNFL he can't be worse than JMart.
@Woods49ers @49ersJunkie Bowman has been the Jack LB. Willis was the Mike. Borland and Wilhoite are better at the Mike. But new D coord too.
@MaioccoCSN any word on his $$ yet?
@Ckwal_1126 @49ersGab yep, I forgot the dolphins
@49ersGab hasn't he only played for NO, DET, and now us? he's 30 and not a #1 back, that seems like a reasonable amount of teams to me.
@Kyle_McLorgBASG dang. I guess I assumed that was a reason we wanted him.
@Kyle_McLorgBASG Bush is not good at blitz pickup?
@49er_Follower @EricG_SF49 coffee was probably the worst thing you could have done. You need to get hydrated.
@49er_Follower @EricG_SF49 LMAO, if your head is still spinning, you might still be drunk
@EricG_SF49 @49er_Follower and to settle your stomach drink bitters and soda
@49ersGab such an underrated part of all the changes
@ripcityproject and boo Raymond Felton
@Tre9er long arms - 32 1/4"
@Tre9er yeah, got to be a high percentage. USC guy probably wants to stay in CA
@Tre9er he's an aggressive corner and has experience in slot. I like it.
@SakamotoRyan backup safety
@SakamotoRyan Cox as their nickel, cause he wouldn't start over Hayden and Gilbert.
@monstr77 maybe not, but I like the investment in a player who adds pass protection experience to the RB position.
@monstr77 if they give him more than Ryan Mathews got from PHI, I would be upset.
@monstr77 a 3 year, 2 guaranteed, makes more sense for Bush IMO. Also, he's not the same role player that Frank would have been.
@MRHawkins49 this is the part about taking the BPA that is bull shit. If Cleveland has Scherff rated highest at 12, they won't take him.
@MRHawkins49 totally agree, but teams have been taking RTs higher and higher each year since the Niners took ADavis.
@Cianaf were the Saints going to win the SB this year? Likely not. Similar to what Houston Rockets did, can't be in the middle.
Saints, Eagles, and 49ers (to a lesser degree) are doing what the Houston Rockets did: can't be avg, be aggressive - good or bad.
@49ersGab @bandlersbanter if he's healthy, he will be fantastic. Plays angry, kind like A Davis does.
@MRHawkins49 My hunch is that he goes in the top 10 to a team who sees him as a OT.
@MRHawkins49 he should be. Fantastic player, fits Niners identity well.
@NFLguy07840 @VincentFrankNFL Especially since most of them said they would have stayed if the money was the same.
Dad jokes - @EddieTheCommish MT @RapSheet - "So the #Rams defensive line will be, ahem, Fairley good. … I’ll show myself out"
@EddieTheCommish @49ersHub oh yeah, 10" hands.
@NinersDan @NinersNation @SoCaliSteph @RaidersReporter we need a swing tackle, JMart isn't gonna cut it.
@NinersDan @Tre9er Reaser played really well before he got hurt, I'm optimistic.
@NinersNation @SoCaliSteph @RaidersReporter He has to be better than Jonathan Martin.
@49ersGab likely 2nd round pick. FAST FAST FAST player.
@49ersHub because Aldon isn't signed past this year.
@49ersHub Gregory has those 34" arms Baalke loves to be hugged with.
@NinersDan @Tre9er I also think that one of the things Baalke wanted in the new coaching staff is a willingness to play the young guys.
@49ersHub BUT...if Gregory is the guy Baalke likes best, he will go get him, he's shown that.
@49ersHub there are 5 really solid edge rushers, and each team will have different grades depending on scheme fit, could slip.
@NinersDan @Tre9er I really thought we would get Culliver back. I'm sad.
@NinersDan @Tre9er possible, tall long guy, Baalke likes long dudes.
@NinersDan @Tre9er you're right, need some experience.
@chazk802 @nfldraftscout Dupree and Gregory are the two edge guys that fit the body type Baalke likes.
@NinersDan @Tre9er I'd be on the phone with NO asking about Keenan Lewis if I were Baalke.
@NinersDan @Tre9er I'm not sure about Mathis, I might rather resign Cook or Terrell Brown and draft a guy high.
@49ersHub I think we will still sign a vet CB, RB, and maybe OG
@BigSwinginNick oh yeah, 15 is a GREAT spot to be. 18-20 true first round graded players by many reports. BPA or trade back an option.
@BigSwinginNick Trae will probably be gone by 15, don't you think?
@BetterRivals Simpson doesn't count either.
@rebdab @BetterRivals High 5 seconds, on turf, and I can only do it once, then I'll need a beer.
@rebdab @BetterRivals I can offer 1 good play a game. Ok, maybe just 1 play a game.
@MRHawkins49 Good luck at your interview!
@MRHawkins49 I have so much feels for you man. You will shake dust out of your personal belongings for years after you leave.
@49ersGab @Cullyinthehouse Whoa! That's a big bag of money for Cully. I'm glad we didn't resign him at that price.
@MRHawkins49 West Texas? like Abilene or Lubbock? Gross.
@49ersHub @timmay_111 there are some really nice 3rd/4th round CB's that fit the mold Baalke likes. Josh Shaw, Eric Rowe, Byron Jones...
@49ersHub @timmay_111 I don't think CB in round 1. Baalke can pluck solid contributors from mid-late rounds.
@MRHawkins49 yeah, Tacoma is actually really nice. Outside of the Seattle hustle and bustle, but urban enough to have things to do.
@49ersHub damnit
@MRHawkins49 and honestly, I only hate them for their sports fans :)
@MRHawkins49 Of course I'm used to Portland which is so centralized.
@MRHawkins49 there are some good parts, beautiful city but poorly planned. Everything is so spread out.
@MRHawkins49 man, I hate that city SO much, and I was born there.
@49ersGab sort of. Bad back, big cap number, hit his peak. Seattle gave up a lot, I think NO won that trade.
@Tre9er @lifesyourcup that 4.48 was faster than I thought he could run, but he does have enough speed and size to be a deep threat.
@NinersDan @Tre9er yes, played FB, H-back, and some TE at OK. Athletic and good hands.
@NinersDan @Tre9er nah, that's gonna be Tre Millard!
@49ersHub the Bills are prepping an offer for Clay even if he has the transition still on him.
@NinersDan @Tre9er so do I, but teams put a premium on size and Funchess has that in spades
@NinersDan @Tre9er depends on how the board falls, if the top 4 WRs are gone by 20, he could be late 1st.
@EddieTheCommish @BetterRivals maybe he's dyeing over there
@BetterRivals @EddieTheCommish Dad jokes done right.
@EddieTheCommish @BetterRivals whoa, do you think those same people thinkthe meaning of Trader Joe's is Traitor Joe's? #mindbottling
@BetterRivals and if the Baalke and the coaching staff are already a little concerned about Hyde's pass blocking, then...
@BetterRivals I agree, however, there are some benefits to a vet RB. Mostly pass protection, hard for some rookies to pick that up quickly.
@BetterRivals oh man, so much.
@BetterRivals I write quite a bit in my job too, stunned at how many people don't know how to simply use spell check.
@Tre9er @49ersHub apparently Mathews is signing in Philly anyway, so...
@BetterRivals when the writers I follow tag it #trader...ugh.
@49ersHub yeah, his offer from PHI was modest, we should offer slightly less.
Attention NFL fans: a #trader is someone who exchanges goods for other goods. A #traitor is someone who flips allegiances.
@49ersHub aren't he and Steve Smith essentially the same player right now? They should look at Bowe.
@SakamotoRyan or resign Culliver.
@49ersGab @SakamotoRyan that dude is HUGE! Bigger than Rhino.
@monstr77 @49ersHub Someone's been playing with fanspeak ;)
@monstr77 @49ersHub we already had an extra 4th, but more is always better.
@Ruthless_Sports Whoa. The fact that is even a conversation is incredible.
@rickgasko and a new third group complaining about group 1 and group 2 ;)
@monstr77 @49ersHub I think that's been settled already, didn't meet the requirements.
@monstr77 @49ersHub This conversation makes me wonder if Brooks will be a draft day trade.
@monstr77 @49ersHub AH HA! Stevie Johnson was the 4th round pick!
@monstr77 @49ersHub I thought it was a 7th for JMart?
@monstr77 @49ersHub Harbaugh.
@monstr77 @49ersHub very true.
@49ersHub yep, plug him in at RG and move Rhino to LG.
@CoryR49 ugh, that was bothering me, thank you for clarifying.
@JabariJYoung but you are right about the difference in talent on the line. I bet Chip upgrades that line in the draft.
@JabariJYoung he also got stopped because he didn't run north and south. Chip wants a guy to cut and run. McCoy danced a bit.
@JabariJYoung but the Eagles play design is better.
@BetterRivals @NinersNation "Speculation swirled Monday morning...a possible cut if he failed a physical."
@BetterRivals @NinersNation the Bowman thing looks like total speculation IMO. Asking the "What if" question. I wouldn't have published it.
@MarkBullockNFL @Manny_PPI Ifo wont be working out, only bench press, still rehabbing his knee and wont be ready till September.
@BetterRivals based on his instagram account, it looks like he's visited two teams. I think he's coming back.
@rebdab @BetterRivals @Tre9er excuses, excuses...
@49ersGab Chris Culliver and Byron Bell as swing tackle
@rebdab @BetterRivals @Tre9er you forgot TE Irv Smith.
@49ersGab I want Boldin.
@49ersGab I don't think Stevie is here long term either way, so the question is, would you rather have Stevie or Boldin for the next 2 years
@MikeTanier @Christian_Gin right, that's the part of the discussion that is up for debate, the part we don't know the truth about.
@BetterRivals @JoshuaBArnold @davidneumann_ leaves the draft wide open, we can truly draft BPA
@BetterRivals @JoshuaBArnold @davidneumann_ we are in a great place, only glaring need is a CB and I think we will sign one soon enough.
@Cullyinthehouse dat city by da bay doe...we want you back!
@Ruthless_Sports @MadSports8 MAYBE WE CAN GET JAMARCUS RUSSELL TOO!!
@pdxroundball at least a park
@49ersGab no, Lloyd has had some very good years, I'm excited for Patton to get a chance.
@49ersGab he reminds me of young Brandon Lloyd.
@49ersGab @EASTBAYDFRESH @nw49erboss @TDavenport_NFL LMAO! what chances?
@NinersNation @BetterRivals oh, and an old TE Irv Smith
@NinersNation @BetterRivals and a RB Paul Smith
@NinersNation @BetterRivals didn't we sign a Garrison Smith to the practice squad last year?
@Christian_Gin @MikeTanier it might be semantics, but it's an important distinction. Was Kap on the block, or just part of talks with PHI?
@Christian_Gin @MikeTanier This doesn't sound like Kap on the trade block, it sounds like a conversation about Kap's availability to me
@ripcityproject Denver is 55% from 3
@49ersHub I'm very surprised by the Ahmed Brooks part.
@EddieTheCommish @Ruthless_Sports @BukoTime I wonder if Fangio would bring Goldson in.
@Tre9er @MeSoDougherty the only way he comes back is if he plays ST, I doubt it.
@Ruthless_Sports @BukoTime and Donatell
@in4td @49er_Follower I fit that description. Well, except for the woman part.
@ottem16 @Ruthless_Sports yeah, he just looked like he didn't care.
@ottem16 @Ruthless_Sports Niners turned down a trade offer for VD from Denver, they think he still has something to offer.
@CamInman who is most likely to be a 49er in 3 years - Collin Kaepernick or Aldon Smith?
@ottem16 @Ruthless_Sports it looks to me like we are going into the season with TE as status quo, unless draft.
@Tre9er nothing quite as special as a father-son bond
@VincentFrankNFL I'm an Oregon fan, he is similar to Harbaugh, won't reveal any information speaks in broad vague language.
@49ersGab The best move they made was hiring Mike Nolan.
@monstr77 yeah, probably
@Christian_Gin Cam Johnson
@monstr77 I think it's only temporary, I bet he's released before the season to make room for the restructured part of Aldon's deal.
@NinersNation I have that same shirt! But my beard is bigger.
@mickenzie77 he said he regrets letting Jerry do it, I doubt he lets Graham wear 80.
@NFLguy07840 @NFL_Stats and a 1st rd draft pick, guess it will be used on a defensive player
@MRHawkins49 that is a good question. The biggest variable to me is pass protection for both teams, without protection neither matters.
@chazk802 @BetterRivals I'm not really that down on Gabbert. He's not gonna light the world on fire, but he has athleticism and starting exp
@BetterRivals I wonder if they were going to go after Jake Locker.
@monstr77 @49ersGab @BetterRivals @Barking5pider @KMart2180 maybe that's what I read.
@monstr77 @49ersGab @BetterRivals @Barking5pider @KMart2180 someone tweeted that Cully was shopping for a house in San Jose
@MRHawkins49 exactly. He has good versatility and can play that 3rd safety role with no pressure.
@DK_England @Tre9er right? Which is why it will probably happen.
@MRHawkins49 agree, he fits Niners well. I think Niners should call on Kenny Vaccaro too.
if every player on the Saints is up for grabs, the Niners should make a call about Kenny Vaccaro.
@49ersHub Maiocco reported both sides open to return, I bet he signs in Seattle.
@49ers_Source @timmay_111 @shakkhan79 Maiocco reported this morning that both Stevie and the 49ers are leaving door open to return.
@49ers_Source @shakkhan79 Crab isn't coming back, maybe Stevie, but not Crab. He gone.
@MRHawkins49 me too, the only jersey I own. I will miss him.
@MRHawkins49 I'm sad to see Willis and Gore leave, I hope Justin comes back middle of the season.
@MRHawkins49 it has been an emotional swing for sure. I guess I expected we were losing Willis this off season to trade or cut anyway.
@49ersGab @TURNCE I think Cully comes back, and we will probably draft another mid-late round corner. I like Dontae, and Acker looked good.
@MRHawkins49 I've never lost hope! Draft will be fun with no glaring needs.

@Tre9er he will probably sign in Seattle and kill it this year
@49ersGab but I think 15 is too early for both those guys. I'd be more comfortable with a trade back into the early-mid 20s.
@49ersGab I like DGB better. Funchess seems to like the slot/inside more than the outside. I like him too though.
@NFLguy07840 @MRHawkins49 maybe, I'm not sure he has much to offer there any more. Maybe on punt returns.
@49ersGab @jogr49 Vick is worthless. Can't play anymore and has mentally checked out. Better off with a UDFA rookie.
@MRHawkins49 I don't think signing Bush means they won't take a RB in the draft. Hyde, Hunter, Bush, draft pick.
@49ersHub I kinda like the idea. Bush has lost a step, but is still a good receiver and is shifty in open space. Runs with more power now.
@NFLguy07840 @rickgasko it already has hurt them, they have no WRs.
@NFLguy07840 @rickgasko Graham's best football is behind him. 28 with a bad back and a lot of wear, not to mention $11M this year.
@in4td @mickenzie77 @Fr1scoT1me @49ersGab another former Seahawk interests me, Walter Thurmond. Can play outside or slot, will be cheap.
@lifesyourcup Cobb
@49ersGab @49er_Follower didn't say I wanted Gabbert, but it's been said he's coming back.
@mickenzie77 @49ersGab ugh, we need Greg Hardy drama like we need another front seven retirement.
@49er_Follower @49ersGab yeah, I don't get it, even on a dirt cheap deal. I hope we draft a late round project at QB.
@49er_Follower @49ersGab oh, and Gabbert
@49er_Follower @49ersGab there will be two more signings, RB and CB.
@Tre9er @Woods49ers edge rusher, WR, OL, DL depending on how the board falls. I bet edge rusher in 1st, WR in 2nd.
@AnthonyLy49 or we're gonna learn the lesson of guys stepping up to fill empty space.
@ottem16 Lynch is up to 275 pounds too, he could move inside to rush in sub packages
@ottem16 this is precisely what I expect them to do. Insurance for Aldon leaving or Lynch being ineffective.
@NFLguy07840 Wouldn't Maxx Williams in the late 1st round make more sense?
@BayAreaFan2 yes, for 1 year, but he sacrifices the run game. Not a good blocker.
@BayAreaFan2 IMO this isn't a great deal for Seattle. Big contract, Jimmy has already peaked, doesn't run block.
@Tre9er this move doesn't scare me
@Ruthless_Sports ha! I knew it! Any word on Culliver? I don't expect either of them back honestly.
@monstr77 ok, gotchya
@monstr77 did you see something about Browner? Other than he may be cut?
@49ersGab @Ryan_Calhoun 
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan well, new coaching staff/philosophy, new deep threat on the outside in Smith, now's the time
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er that's a good point.
@Tre9er Yep, and maybe another UDFA to compete for practice squad
@eddieurs49 @JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er uh, nope. Saw someone theorize that maybe Baalke was trying to trade Pat.
@Tre9er right, FO must think the new staff can get him back.
@Tre9er and if we are gonna have some inconsistent CBs, why pay them? Just draft them, or sign someone even less like Thurmond.
@SportsNation @BayAreaFan2 Only the bandwagon fans.
@eddieurs49 @JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er that's what we've been told. Who's to say Baalke didn't influence it.
Interesting that Vernon wasn't available to be traded when Denver asked.
@BayAreaFan2 @Tre9er I wonder if Cox wont be easier. Maybe he goes to CHI to be with his mentor Donatell
@Tre9er it will be really interesting to see what level of success we had achieved was due to players or coaches.
@Tre9er my gut wonders if either of them come back.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er a good FO moves on from players at the right time, in this case it might include Gore and Willis, both have declined
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er now, I'm not trying to suggest Baalke/York make a top level FO, I don't believe that. I like Baalke a lot...But
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er The Rams did it in 1999 after winning the Super Bowl, went to the playoffs the next year
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er they went 8-8 and missed the playoffs. The Patriots have done it, the Packers did it too.
@DK_England @Tre9er we were also prepared to lose Cowboy
@Tre9er @JmeMiller1974 Baltimore after they wont the Super Bowl
@metaljohnradio can you imagine if we sign Hardy AND Rice, then drafted DGB?
@monstr77 right
@monstr77 yep, gonna play with his buddy Andre.
@Michael_RA @9erDrew and I don't think the Niners need a DL guy, they need edge rush, WR, CB, and OG. The best value is edge rush in rd1 IMO
@Michael_RA @9erDrew but clearly Baalke loves value, this is why he takes injured players like Brandon Thomas and Tank Carradine
@Michael_RA @9erDrew that's a good observation, Baalke seems to target a player in round 1, but works the draft board more later.
@Michael_RA @9erDrew ...hmm, I'm having a hard time articulating this.
@Michael_RA @9erDrew yeah, you're right. Let me say what I mean in a different way, cause every team ultimately drafts for need...
@chazk802 @9erDrew he's throwing with DGB for sure. It may come up in conversation, but Baalke does what he wants.
@9erDrew but we don't know what to expect our of a guy who blew his knee out and plays in the trenches.
@9erDrew Boldin wont be around many more seasons, need his replacement. Now is the time to get a raw freak like DGB.
@9erDrew Rember, Baalke doesn't draft for need, he drafts for value. He loves draft value. if WR is the best value, he takes it.
@9erDrew need depth behind Smith and Lynch. Smith may not be around next year and Lynch can't be counted on after only 1 season.
@9erDrew I think 1st will be an edge rusher. If for some reason all top 5 edge guys are gone, then WR or OG Brandon Scherff
@9erDrew Baalke keeps hitting on mid-late round CB, don't think we go there in the 1st. DL depth is good, lots of young guys.
@BigSwinginNick @NinersNation either way, at 15 we will get one of the top 5 edge guys, top 3 WR, Scherff or Shelton. Or even a trade back
@BigSwinginNick @NinersNation but mocks wont be the same as the real draft for sure.
@BigSwinginNick @NinersNation and you should stick to your board. I don't think all 5 of the top edge guys will be gone by 15
@49ers_Source @in4td the offer was reportedly 1 year $4M, which is a little more than I would have offered, though I would have gone 2 years
@NinersNation I love DGB at 15, but I think the better value at 15 is a pass rusher who slips and WR value in round 2 is very good.
@49ersHub @49ersGab gotchya, I totally missed it. Knew it was coming, but I thought it would happen after Smith signs.
@49ersHub @49ersGab that's the combo I'm most pleased with, I like Wilhoite and Moody as depth/ST guys, and Wilhoite can start.
@49ersHub @49ersGab did you see that Stevie Johnson was released yesterday? 
@StellaLibretto nah, today will bring great possibilities
@49ersHub @49ersGab he's not a good match with Borland. Need a guy who can cover with Borland. Spikes with Bow I like.
So Stevie Johnson was released last night? 
@timmay_111 if we end up with Torrey Smith, there is better value at WR in second round too. I think edge guy in 1st all the way.
@timmay_111 Fowler, Gregory, Beasley, Ray, Dupree, maybe even Harold.
@timmay_111 maybe, one of those pass rushers will fall to 15. Too many good WRs and DL. There are 5 solid early-mid 1st round PR's IMO
@AJGullotta @49erLance Ward still starts at nickel, but Thurmond can back him up if Cox leaves. I bet Cox follows Donatell to CHI
@AJGullotta @49erLance I wonder if Baalke will look at Walter Thurmond. Looked at him before, could be cheap and can play slot.
@AJGullotta @49erLance I agree, if he's cheap. I just don't want to listen to the shit that will come from it.
@49erLance but Borland and Wilhoite are solid starters, we only need depth.
@AJGullotta @49erLance for sure we can, but not Baalke's style. He doesn't spend big on CB.
@AJGullotta @49erLance and a vet edge guy like Trent Cole or LaMarr Woodley
@AJGullotta @49erLance and I love the idea of Spiller
@AJGullotta @49erLance  l like that list, but I bet it's Cox or Culliver (especially now that we have more cap room) and Chris Cook
@timmay_111 TJE can play it too, I just mean for depth. I think we take and edge rusher in the 1st round.
@SakamotoRyan @fids1 maybe add a draft pick who can play NT and 3-tech.
@49erLance FA additions should be WR, RB, OG, CB.
@49erLance we are pretty flush at DE and ILB. I bet we only fill those spots with draft picks or UDFA.
@Dmonroe4 it could be worse, they could be the 49ers
@AJGullotta @Woods49ers agree. The situation looks worse than it is. Still, we need this press like we need another retirement announcement
@Woods49ers he pushed a woman out of his car
@rebdab uh, not for the Niners, considering the Colts.
@ganthner but Willis is the only one that was a surprise, everyone else was expected to leave.
@monstr77 cause he's not worth $5M IMO. I would have offered $3.5M/year for 2 years
@monstr77 not a pure passing team, play action.
@Tre9er @BigSwinginNick maybe mamma and poppa York want to save some more money.
@JamesBradySBN and a whiskey?
@rickgasko hahahaha
@EddieTheCommish @NFLguy07840 and resign Skuta who can play all 4 LB spots.
@NFLguy07840 @EddieTheCommish didn't Borland miss the last two games?
@BigSwinginNick I'm so on the fence about this Kap stuff, I could go either way.
@9ersEv @monstr77 and Adam Schefter is usually right on this stuff, he said 0% Kap is on trade block.
@monstr77 @9ersEv there are some local guys who know what's going on. Maiocco is the one I trust the most.
@monstr77 @9ersEv National reporters are saying that many teams are telling them Kap isn't available.
@9ersEv I just think this statement was exaggerated. Baalke receiving calls doesn't = Kap on the trade block.
@9ersEv @monstr77 Niners may have taken some calls asking about Kaps availability, that is all.
@9ersEv @monstr77 Kap isn't being shopped, those rumors were shot down by multiple local and national reporters.
@Tre9er @NinersDan @9ersEv ok, I suppose scheme may change a little too with Mangini.
@NinersDan @Tre9er @9ersEv I thought Tank was more a 5-tech. Can he play 3-tech?
@StellaLibretto @Tre9er I think we lose both. Cox will go play for his buddy Donatell in Chicago.
@JamesBradySBN you should sit down, and if you are already sitting, do it again.
@Tre9er @9ersEv I'm more interested in a 3-tech to replace Justin.
@AJGullotta @9ersEv right, not doubting that. Rumors alone could scare people away, that is all.
@AJGullotta @9ersEv right, but so much can change, especially with all the Kap trade rumors.
@AJGullotta @9ersEv I'll believe it when the team announces it.
@9ersEv the reports about Crab and Iupati are fake, though I don't expect either to be back. Torrey Smith anyone?
@monstr77 @9erDrew @chazk802 I don't think NT is a priority, we will be in sub packages 50% of the time anyway. We need that 3 tech.
@monstr77 @9erDrew @chazk802 oh yeah, Dial isn't a true NT. I liked how Dorsey played there.
@chazk802 @9erDrew can you say DL in round 1? I've said it all along.
@chazk802 @9erDrew haven't seen enough of Tank to know where he fits. I think he can play 3 and 5, but I'm not sure. Seems like 5 tech to me
@chazk802 @9erDrew but Docket does't play the 3 tech spot Justin does. I bet Dial will. Docket replaces Ray Mac
@DK_England @Tre9er not comparable. Coffee didn't play as many seasons and Patrick isn't crazy.
.@PatrickWillis52 You have been my favorite player for a long time. I'm sad to hear I won't get to see you play again. God Bless you!
@chazk802 many times the #'s are leaked to the media from the agent.
@chazk802 not officially, only as a leak to a reporter.
@chazk802 they haven't officially announced it, the info is leaked and reported by writers.
@9erDrew the official announcement isn't coming until Tuesday, which is the first day teams can officially announce trades.
@MRHawkins49 totally. I've considered Andy Lee because he will be a Niner for life.
@chazk802 @DAdeshiyan @Tre9er Willis to WAS or CHI for a draft pick.
@chazk802 @DAdeshiyan @Tre9er I don't think AP makes sense, this team wants a platoon kind of back to play with Carlos.
@MRHawkins49 Me too, the only jersey I own.
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er @chazk802 &lt;sigh&gt; Me too.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er the article says official announcement will come Tuesday, it's gonna be a trade. My bet is still Willis.
@DAdeshiyan @Tre9er @chazk802 ah, ok.
@MRHawkins49 the Gore thing is understandable, Willis would make me cry.
@49ersHub but the team can't announce trades till Tuesday at 4EST
@Tre9er maybe it's a Justin Smith retirement press conference
@Tre9er hmm, that's possible, but would it be shocking?
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan @chazk802 no, said later today
@timmay_111 @Tre9er maybe it's Bethea?
@timmay_111 @Tre9er I don't think Brooks will shock anyone.
@DAdeshiyan @chazk802 @Tre9er It can't be a trade, teams can't announce trades till 4PM EST March 10th.
@Tre9er @chazk802 well, I hope it's one of those 3 and not Willis.
@timmay_111 @Tre9er and that report says the news will be shocking.
@chazk802 @Tre9er @ProFootballTalk could be Stevie I suppose.
@chazk802 @Tre9er right, I don't think Vernon is big news, his release would be expected.
@timmay_111 @Tre9er yeah, I hope he was telling the truth. I don't think a Vernon release makes sense, he only has one year left.
@Tre9er @ProFootballTalk Willis, I'm telling you it's Willis, and I will be mortified.
@49ersHub @jesse_brooks go look at what Schefter just tweeted
@BetterRivals I'm not sold this is a Niner leak. Baalke was very quick to shoot it down, not how he usually responds.
@BetterRivals @Jcool0 #3 this story has been over exaggerated if not flat out misreported.
@JmeMiller1974 how about the season Singletary couldn't get anyone to say yes to be the OC?
@NFLguy07840 @BetterRivals I think it's true that Baalke listened to some offers, but in my mind that doesn't equal Kap on the block
@BetterRivals @BigMiles154 you clear cap space to sign defensive players because you are giving up all your draft picks for Mariota.
@NFLguy07840 @BetterRivals initially yes, but it has been confirmed by other people as well.
@DK_England and Chip is probably only calling about Kap to gauge the value of his draft picks to get Mariota.
@DK_England @Tre9er Kap isn't going anywhere unless we get a huge offer, which we wont.
@DK_England @Tre9er I feel much better about the situation this morning, much more than my first reaction last night.
@49ersHub What has been reported is that PHI and CHI called US. The part about Kap being on the trade block is click-bait
@DK_England @Tre9er and if PHI was willing to give up Foles and two 1st round picks, Baalke better listen.
@49ersHub When in reality, he isn't.
@49ersHub He listened and said no. Sources from those teams report what happened, and it's said Kap is on the trading block.
@49ersHub right, I just think the story has been spun in a way that it shouldn't have. Baalke took calls from PHI and CHI about Kap.
@DK_England @Tre9er then the information leaked that the Niners had listened to requests and is reported as Kap on the trade block.
@DK_England @Tre9er Here is what I gather has happened. PHI and CHI called Baalke and asked if Kap was available. Baalke listened.
@49ersHub right, ok I see what you are saying
@49ersHub Vincent Frank said he confirmed it with two sources.
@BetterRivals maybe it came from a team that doesn't want the Niners to sign Torrey Smith
@Tre9er also, it would leave $9M+ in dead money on the cap. Just doesn't make sense.
@49ersHub as a fan, I feel Baalke is the only one I CAN trust right now. He has a proven track record of good decision making.
@49ersHub we have no reason to trust Baalke?
@timmay_111 @BetterRivals exactly.
@timmay_111 @BetterRivals he's a boxing trainer who trains Gore and Crab. Said some comments about how awful the Niners FO is.
@BetterRivals that guy could also be digging for attention. Dumping on the 49er front office is a good way to build a following right now.
@AlSacco49 but those comments may not be about Frank, they are about Crab who that guy also trains.
@EddieTheCommish sure, but that doesn't tarnish his history as a Niner.
@EddieTheCommish and we don't owe him anything, we have already paid him, and gave him a chance after he destroyed his knees
did anyone think Gore was coming back? Cause, I didn't. Not about money, it's about his role.
@9ersEv but we can't make those kind of assumptions, we have no idea. Meanwhile everyone is loosing their shit.
@BetterRivals @Maximill15 he's also Crab's trainer, maybe this is about Crab?
@9ersEv he also trains Crab. 
@9ersEv hold on now, how do you know its about Gore? I've seen that it was about Crab.
@NinersDan @SakamotoRyan yes, I think Kap is a much different personality than Russell, he might get along with Harvin.
@Tre9er but you should, you really should.
@Tre9er why not compare to Portland, just to keep Niner fans happy!
@Tre9er why's it gotta be Seattle?
Whoa, Lynch at 275? Is he gonna play some 3 tech?
@MathsAnderson @49ersHub I don't understand how Cole fits, but I don't think I want to second guess Baalke, he'd damn good.
@MathsAnderson @49ersHub agreed. I love the idea of Maclin, but I don't think it happens. Sounds like Baalke is after Trent Cole
@in4td @NFLguy07840 @NinersNation probably an open competition for the G and C spots. Brandon Thomas and Looney in the mix too
@MathsAnderson @49ersHub not yet, but we could get it with some restructures
@49ersHub Maclin, hands down.
@TheRealTimmyP I think OT Jeremiah Poutasi (3rd round) looks like a Baalke guy. Big, long arms, plays T but could play G too.
@chazk802 @Tre9er I don't think it's so much about showing he can stay clean, he's mostly done that. I think they want him long term fosho
@TheRealTimmyP I'm guessing Baalke takes one of the top 5 pass rushers who slip to 15.
@TheRealTimmyP nah, depth guy, replaces Brandon Lloyd and gives us a rotation deep threat guy.
@chazk802 @Tre9er I wonder if this Aldon deal comes with a handshake on an extension to be done at some point.
@chazk802 @Tre9er It wouldn't surprise me if neither of them are back. I bet we resign Cook, draft a CB, and maybe sign Terrell Brown
@9ersEv 
@chazk802 @Tre9er he is really creative, and he might become more creative with his buddy Gamble helping him.
@49ersGab @Buddy_Boy69 Trent Cole
@chazk802 @Tre9er I'm guessing Trent Cole is the next signing, but I don't get why.
@chazk802 @Tre9er a little less, but yes. I think it's $3.7M
@chazk802 @Tre9er this allows us to spend the money we will save on marking Brooks a June 1 cut, now.
@chazk802 @Tre9er essentially. The savings on Aldon's restructure is immediate, but will grow to his original number as the season goes on
@49ers_Source but don't get your hopes up, Baalke isn't a big money spender.
@49ers_Source FA hasn't even started yet, we have signed 3 guys, 1 of which is a starter. Plenty to be excited about!
@49ers_Source reminds me of the Perish Cox signing after he left Denver, or Chris Cook after MIN. Those turned out pretty well.
@49ers_Source he doesn't have to excite you, he's a min salary guy for depth, who happens to be a deep threat. Replaces Lloyd.
@MRHawkins49 I love it, my preference is to get DGB in the 1st. I think we might have to take him at 15 though, he isn't going to last.
@monstr77 that thing is so fun, I play all day long.
@MRHawkins49 sure, I agree. Don't think Iupati get's less than $5M. I'd rather just roll the dice with Brandon Thomas or a draft pick
@CoryR49 @49ersGab We have 7, plus we will get 1-2 compensatory picks
@49ersGab would you rather have Bowe or Crab? Let's say price is the same.
@MRHawkins49 can we get him for $5-6M, or do we have to pay $7-8M?
@MRHawkins49 depends on how much he signs for.
Now that we have Dockett and Simpson signed, is it crazy to think Baalke takes a CB in round 1?Marcus Peters, PJ Williams, Jalen Collins...
@monstr77 he will take Brandon Lloyd's spot.
@monstr77 give it a chance, he's a down field threat.
Retweet if you think decisions that affect the Internet shouldn't be made in secret. @RonWyden 
@monstr77 man, Lynden Trail looks like a Baalke guy, doesn't he.
@rebdab @NFLguy07840 yeah, it's a trek, the south part of our state while Portland is North.
@rebdab @NFLguy07840 about 5-6 hour drive
@rebdab @NFLguy07840 or better yet, come for a visit and we can go on a brewery crawl!!
@rebdab @NFLguy07840 sorry, if I could send some sunshine your way, I would
@9erDrew right, I like Marshall too, just mean that those other guys are available which drives the price down on Marshall
@9erDrew Andre Johnson and Dwayne Bowe available too
@9erDrew sounds like it's a buyers market, might be able to offer much less than a mid round or wait for him to be released.
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er besides, Baalke is a BPA draft guy, he's gonna take who he wants regardless of position need.
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er I can see reason behind it, just saying it's all up in the air now.
@BigSwinginNick @Tre9er but now we have 11 DL guys, I bet we don't draft one at all, maybe an undrafted FA for camp/practice squad.
@NFLguy07840 I had to mow my lawn this week. Gonna be 70 in Portland, OR this weekend!!
@9ersEv ooh, I hope so!
@BayAreaFan2 bwahahaha! I like Cockett, maybe a nickname, though I'm not calling it to his face
@Tre9er are you sure?
@chazk802 @Tre9er we haven't really tried to find alternate ways to make food, just alternate foods. Lots of lentils and beans.
@rebdab @Tre9er yes, my newer pans are more difficult to cook in. Wish I had some 40 year olds. Uh, pans that is.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er yeah, no. I only offer 3 specific suggestions now.
@Tre9er @rebdab room temp meat for BBQ/Smoke too
@Tre9er @rebdab just make sure any meat you put in a cast iron has had time to get up to room temperature first.
@Tre9er @rebdab that's great.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er it makes going out to eat a challenge.
@Tre9er depends on the application. Use this guide: 
@rebdab @Tre9er YES!! Never wash a cast iron, only scrape it out and occassionally rinse
@Tre9er I'm doing a whole chicken in white wine, lemon, and veggies in the dutch oven tonight!
@Tre9er we eat a TON of eggs, just not scrambled very often, and my wife is allergic to wheat, rice, and tree nuts so no pancakes.
@Tre9er one of my favorite methods of cooking.
@Tre9er I have a small 6" cast iron solely for eggs, and a cast iron griddle for pancakes. However, we don't eat pancakes or scrambled often
@Tre9er I have a couple of different enameled dutch oven sizes, and a straight cast iron dutch oven I use on a Weber.
@Tre9er right, you need to use the right pan in those situations, and you sometimes need to use more oil in cast iron.
@JaysonBraddock you think there is a chance Gregory gets to 15? Beasley and Adams maybe, can't see Gregory slipping that far.
@49ersHub most importantly, this proves the FO and new coaching staff aren't going to scare away players.
@Tre9er I try to use only cast iron or my BBQ/Smoker, and I cook almost every night at my house. Love my cast iron dutch ovens.
@49ersHub @jesse_brooks ooooohhh, that opening track, damn
@KevinAMolina85 @MRHawkins49 that is an excellent point
@MRHawkins49 I think, more than any other WR, DGB is the best fit for Kap on the field. I think Tomsula is the right guy for him off
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan ok, but I cant live through Ginn dropped 80 yard TD passes any longer
@Tre9er @DAdeshiyan yes, but how many WRs are we gonna carry? Boldin, Ellington, Patton, Ginn, Draft pick, maybe Johnson/FA/Draft pick
@monstr77 @Tre9er you can only simulate so much
@Tre9er that's how I read it too, not a good sign if he signs.
@Tre9er just cap hits
@Tre9er you got Culliver and Iupati for half what I expected them to get.
@bulldog9er my brother is autistic, I appreciate your work.
@Tre9er $3.5M year, 2 year deal, 50% guaranteed
@rickgasko It would be interesting to know if he's changed his WR eval process at all knowing he's had little success.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 but with the depth of the WR class, GMs can take a position in round 1 that has a greater drop off, like PR
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 would really love a trade back to get one of those mid-late 1st round WRs if top 3 are off the board.
@rickgasko This is what I've been saying. Deep WR class, we get one in the 2nd round or later. Baalke is a value slut.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 Baalke is a value slut
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 which is exactly why I think Baalke doesn't take a WR in round 1
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 sounds about right, and the value of WR in the second round will be fantastic.
@NinersNation @MaioccoCSN all the tulips bloomed in my yard this week because it's unseasonably warm in Portland, OR.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er Strong, Funchess, Devin Smith - All guys who teams could have 1st round grades on too.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er but there are potentially 8 WRs with 1st round grades, have to think some of those guys fall to round 2 and so on
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er I agree with you, he surprised me on tape and he has NFL blood lines/good family support.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er also not likely 8 WRs go in round 1 even if they are graded that high. Could push Perriman to round 3 or early 4.
@Tre9er Brooks in camp? He's gonna make it past June 2nd?
@Tre9er gave up on Lemonier after only 2 seasons?
@Tre9er Oh, Cully and Cox. Didn't release Brooks?
@Tre9er book it
@Rand_Getlin nope
@49ersGab gotchya.
@49ersGab so, 2 for 1? or Dockett is Justin's replacement?
@49ersGab do you know some secrets?
@Tre9er @chazk802 I'd like both!
@in4td @Tre9er I don't have any video of Saxton, so I couldn't say.
@Tre9er right, I think he has some potential, I'd prefer he used his hands more, but I think he could get comfortable inline with more reps
@Tre9er he has some definite deficiencies, body catches much of the time, blocking is inconsistent, more comfortable in slot than inline.
@Tre9er I'm interested to see what you think of Tyler Kroft from Rutgers. Big Kelce kind of guy
@Tre9er have you watched any video of TE other than Walford?
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er couldn't down years from VD and others be attributed to JH and the coaching staff?
@chazk802 yes, would love the attitude he brings.
@chazk80 the 5 tech on the strong side opposite Justin Smith, but used in rotation, lots of rotation next year I think.
@Tre9er man, fanspeak is so much fun.
@adbrandt @alexmarvez ...Gore and Lynch too
@JmeMiller1974 one of the under the radar pieces of this story is the arrogance of Baalke/York, who think JH should have won more
@JmeMiller1974 I agree.
@JmeMiller1974 not me. There will be lots of Jim bashing still to come, people want to frame what happened in a way they can have hope
@JmeMiller1974 not that Harbaugh sucks, but that he had a lower ceiling than we thought. He was very conservative, which was good and bad
@Woods49ers uh, Niners have $7.5 mil before they release or restructure anyone. But I don't expect them to make a "splash"
@iropp nah, their OC, Koetter, gave Helfrich his first coaching job at Oregon in 1997
@john_49_ yeah, hard to say. I can't wait to see him in pads. I've heard some KR rumors too. He's got the body to be a RB.
@john_49_ apparently, Jimmy T has a very specific role and plan for him. This is why he signed with us and not DET.
@DAdeshiyan @BigSwinginNick @49ersGab would really love to get Lockett, but I think he goes rnd 2, and I doubt we go WR on consecutive picks
@DAdeshiyan @BigSwinginNick @49ersGab I agree, unless one of the top 3 WR are available at 15, otherwise I take DGB, maybe McBride later
@DAdeshiyan @BigSwinginNick @49ersGab well, the reports from OK about the last year will be positive. His older brother moved in and helped
@BigSwinginNick @DAdeshiyan @49ersGab it all comes down to how comfortable the FO is with his off field issues
@DAdeshiyan @BigSwinginNick @49ersGab yes, and Kap loves to throw jump balls. DGB has a HUGE catch radius. I like Funchess for that too
@49ersGab @BigSwinginNick maybe, this is a much different situation than in past. New coaching staff, and Adam Henry has a good track record
@BigSwinginNick @49ersGab can't just take the guy who is the deep threat because you need speed. Take the better player. Get deep guy later
@BigSwinginNick @49ersGab I think I lean to DGB because he will have a more rounded game, but I'd be happy with either of those guys
@BigSwinginNick @49ersGab I think DGB is the bigger risk/reward player, but those two have much different styles.
@49ersGab right, I love both those guys. DGB is very raw, needs good coaching to use his gifts. Smith is plug-n-play IMO, seasoned player.
@49ersGab I assume the player who hasn't played is DGB, who is the proven deep threat?
@NFLosophy Chip has said he doesn't need a specific player at QB, doesn't make sense for them to trade up.
@PFF @PFF_Jeff but what about over the last 2 years? Has that trend changed?
@Ninerfan4Martin @jamesmann23 yeah, but the point is that it's never as bad as it seems when it comes to cap. Unless you are the Saints.
@Ninerfan4Martin @jamesmann23 I was told by a cap guy a month ago that the Niners could EASILY get to $30m under with cuts and restructures
@Ninerfan4Martin @jamesmann23 many have reported it, Maiocco most recently
@Ninerfan4Martin @jamesmann23 yes, that's correct. Nearly $6.5 mil in cap carry over from last year. The $143m cap really helped.
@Christian_Gin @spotrac according to OTC, after the carry over from last year, Niners are about $7.5 under.
@nickpepp @chazk802 I think we have a better chance at keeping Culliver, but will offer less than he can get elsewhere.
@nickpepp @chazk802 I don't think either Cox or Culliver come back. I think Cox goes to Bears. Donatell is his biggest supporter.
@webmusicguy @GrayBlue @shinguardian Tin Cup from Colorado if you can get it. Hudson from NY is fantastic too.
@EddieTheCommish @MRHawkins49 he blocked really well last year, I'm not ready to give up on him, I think he has some ability.
@meredi_a I only caught the end, what a great win!
#NetNeutrality victory! Grumpy Cat flies over @Comcast HQ to say Don't Mess with the Internet! 
@Tre9er he also said there isn't much difference between playing RT and OG.
@Tre9er well, that escalated quickly
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er yes, Bloody Mary's are not on my house menu.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 oh man, now that you are in Georgia you need to sip some bourbon on occasion in a rocking chair, maybe a mint julep
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 do it. Chocolate cake and whiskey.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 parents who are more than just apathetic, they ignore their children's needs
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 but we were talking about the extreme. Parents who don't go to conferences or blame schools for their problems.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 nah, that's not what I would consider being a shitty parent. You clearly are interested in caring for your kid.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 There is a difference between telling a parent what the student needs, and telling the parent they are no good.
@MRHawkins49 my wife would love that.
@MRHawkins49 my wife is a teacher, there is really no way to tell shitty parents they are shitty, even teachers can't do it.
@MRHawkins49 I think Devin Smith is what Baalke wanted AJ Jenkins to be.
@MRHawkins49 I really like the idea of D. Smith with Kap. He has an underrated catch radius.
@MRHawkins49 haha!! I like that idea.
@MRHawkins49 yes, there will be some WR of value in a trade back as well. I'm with ya BPA, Baalke is true to that as well.
@MRHawkins49 agreed. I just hope we get a WR in round 1.
@MRHawkins49 I don't think the Niners have a great shot at him, don't like him at 25. His workouts will move him up to the 25-40 range.
@MRHawkins49 if a 3/4 team drafts him to play end, he wont be ready this year unless it's as a sub package rusher.
@MRHawkins49 oh, no. He was always a DE at UCLA. You are thinking of a different player. He made six starts at DE as a true frosh
@MRHawkins49 and those hands! 11" hands. Should be able to just move guys around.
@MRHawkins49 he played DE in HS and maybe TE/WR on offense. Of course most really good players play both sides.
@MRHawkins49 his younger brothers have been more interested in wrestling &amp; track. I don't think either plays FB, both are bigger than he was
@MRHawkins49 in high school? Maybe. He was a fantastic runner, ran an 11 second 100m
@MRHawkins49 agree, or a strong side DE in a 4-3. So much length. He played at my son's high school and was a dynamite wrestler.
@Tre9er yeah, I bet I would love it, but my wife is small and won't like a mattress too firm.
@Tre9er good feedback. Probably wont go with sleep number, gut I wont go Casper either. Looking at a Leesa.
@Tre9er so do you have an update on the Casper mattress?
@ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er Armstead is a fantastic athlete, but not a fantastic football player.
@Tre9er @NinersNation @SoCaliSteph @49ersHub maybe you should further her fight by wearing said women's merch.
@ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er I would rather get Preston Smith in a later round than Armstead in round 1.
@ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er YES! Love the strength at point of attack and he uses his long arms well.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er a couple of guys have said Hardy is their favorite WR this year. Plays much bigger than his actual size.
@Tre9er someone this morning was talking CBs, but I can't remember who...
@Tre9er almost gets a tackle for loss, almost gets a sack, almost recovers a fumble.
@Tre9er Just went back and watched the cuts from the National championship game. I'm kind of amazed at how many times he ALMOST makes a play
@Tre9er has good feet and hands, plays with good leverage. I just don't see Dial kind of brute strength
@Tre9er I think he fits a Fangio system well, he will add more strength in NFL. But how different/same will the Niners scheme be next year?
@Tre9er the tough thing about evaluating him is that the coaching staff didn't ask him to really pass rush much last year
@Tre9er need to watch him vs Stanford and USC. Also, Oregon really struggled to stop Wash St.
@Tre9er no, not a country strong kind of guy. Most of the pac-12 O-lines were weak too, finesse guys.
@Tre9er I don't think he will be as good as Justin, but they play a similar game. Good at holding point and occupying blocks.
@Tre9er Armstead will be a solid player, not a star IMO, I think he has more Justin Smith to him than Tank or Dial.
@Tre9er ok, yeah. But if I'm trading back I want one of the second tier WRs at 20-25. or a CB.
@Tre9er right, but why spend a 15 on that.
@Tre9er I really thought he'd measure in at 34" arms at least, but he didn't and I don't think he's much of a PRer.
@Tre9er I'm on the fence. I see some solid things, but he wasn't the best player on the Dline at Oregon. I'd like him late 1st.
@JoeGoodberry he has HUGE hands, if he gets a coach who can show him how to use them he will be great.
@JoeGoodberry I see him as an Ahmed Brooks type, fantastic at setting the edge with some PR ability but not dominant.
@JoeGoodberry Owa went to my sons high school, he was a fantastic wrestler.
@NinersNation YES! love the idea of Herremans replacing Iupati. Good vet next to an inexperienced C.
@EricG_SF49 @bulldog9er Amazon released pilot episodes of original content, much of it was very good.
@ottem16 and Tank!
@ottem16 after next year, gotchya. Well, he didn't play well the second half of last season, he has something to prove. I hope he signs.
@monstr77 @NinersNation it's the typical big network click bait gimmick from the NFL network. ESPN does it too.
@NinersNation and even if they did move on from Willis/Bowman, why would hey cut them and not trade them? Makes no sense.
@ottem16 where did that thought come from?
@49ersGab I don't think that is a good fit.
@Tre9er I absolutely love Parker, I think he's my favorite, especially when watching the 2013 film.
@monstr77 love it.
@NinersNation @AaronNagler @Dave_Gillette I'm in a glass case of emotion.

LMFAOOOO 
@49ersHub @VincentFrankNFL on ESPN radio Chicago. Said he's been working on the story since September.
@Freakyjean99 come back Ricky!! We want some PB&amp;J!!
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 If Baalke is worried about losing Justin and wants another good talented DL guy, he doesn't sign RJF
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 not that he changes much, but shows a little more about what Baalke envisions for this roster.
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 also, Baalke might be looking for a different type of WR now, he's a smart guy, learns from his past.
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 Devin Smith does, he's a first rounder. Justin Hardy does, he's a 2nd/3rd rounder. Maybe even Dorsett
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 I'm feeling more confident about WR in round 1 if we sign RJF this week.
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 DGB's older brother moved in with him at OK after he was kicked out of Missouri. Has helped him a lot
@chazk802 @49ers_Source I think Kap would benefit from someone with a larger catch radius, but the offensive style wasn't helping him.
@49ers_Source @chazk802 @d_rohr DGB plays WR in a similar style that Aldon rushes the passer. So much leverage.
@chazk802 @d_rohr @49ers_Source I'm not really sure DGB has an NFL comparison. Has great size and athleticism, love his blocking
@d_rohr @49ers_Source @chazk802 yeah, Hill went to Ga Tech where he never learned to be a WR. DGB is much different, but has concerns
@49ers_Source @chazk802 I like Funchess, but I LOVE Parker. I really like Devin Smith from Ohio St. too.
@chazk802 @49ers_Source DGB has a Randy Moss "I'll play when I want to play" attitude at times.
@daddymedic49 hmm,  where are they hearing this? Just speculation?
@daddymedic49 from whom are you hearing this?
@Michael_RA @49ers_Source right, that's what I mean
@Michael_RA @49ers_Source I think Devin Smith is a true deep threat, and Kevin White will pull the top off a defense.
@Michael_RA @49ers_Source I don't like the idea of him as a true TE, he's not terribly physical. Maybe as an H-back. A terror from the slot
@Michael_RA @49ers_Source The thing I am most impressed with on him is his body control, he adjusts to throws very well.
@Michael_RA @49ers_Source on tape he doesn't reach top speed very quickly, but he can run, and as you point out, win the rebound
@DeSimone_80 a gift card to the Brows graphic designer
@49ers_Source I didn't expect to like him, then I watched the tape and I'm sold. He's not far behind the top 3 IMO, neither is Devin Smith
@49ers_Source DBs consistently gave Funchess a 8 yard cushion, afraid to get beat deep, even Ohio St. played him that way.
@49ers_Source you need to watch Funchess on video, he's not that slow. He's a solid 4.55 guy and will show it at his pro day
@49ers_Source I hope I'm wrong. I want DGB or Funchess.
@49ers_Source I don't see WR at 15, unless White or Cooper are available. I don't think they will be.
@49ers_Source there are 5 solid edge rushers, but there are 10-12 solid WRs. Baalke always goes with the value.
@49ers_Source depends on who is available. I think it will be a pass rusher if one of the top 5 are available.
@49ers_Source they will probably take both. And a pass rusher, OL, and RB too
@jesse_brooks @Tre9er I liked the podcast, only wished there was more to listen to!
@Tre9er you have Funchess and Smith close if not equal to the top 3 WR group? Essentially top 5 closely rated players?
@chazk802 uh, split time on both sides with Dorsey and Dial. It looks like a nice rotation actually
@chazk802 Tank is projected to that weak side DE where Justin plays, but I think Justin comes back next year. Tank will split time
@monstr77 correct, if Baalke moves up to top 10 we have less picks. If he moves back we have more picks
@chazk802 different types of players. Tank is a base DE and can move inside on passing downs. Won't play outside or stand up and cover
@chazk802 I think so, more importantly, Baalke seems to believe that as well.
@chazk802 yes, it was awful, and didn't get much better when he came back.
@chazk802 but, Fowler, Gregory, and Shane Ray look more like Baalke guys to me than Beaseley and Dupree #longarms
@chazk802 add in the uncertainty of Aldon staying beyond this year and you have a solid case for PR in round 1.
@monstr77 that 5.1m figure might be a little high and depends on how many picks we use
@monstr77 The difference is projected draft pick salary for 2015. OTC doesn't include it, Spotrac has 5.1m dedicated for draft.
@monstr77 OTC is right
@grantmp1 that's a long time.
@chazk802 BUT, there are about 4-5 solid edge rushers in this draft and maybe 10-12 solid WR options.
@chazk802 yeah, I really don't know what to think. Everyone is optimistically making a case for WR in round 1, and I agree on the reasons...
@chazk802 maybe. I think the dark horse is Funchess. So much length.
@Tre9er @rickgasko and Devin Smith in the 3rd. Lets hope this can become more than just a SIM :)
@Tre9er @lifesyourcup I agree, looked like he had good long speed on video.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta well sure. If Gregory is there at 15 (which is not likely at all), no way he passes.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er I like it, especially if pass rush (read Aldon) is better.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 yes, and better value to get a NT in middle rounds anyway.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta this team needs speed and play making on the outside, Baalke knows this, he will get some guys, I just wonder when.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta Or a guy like Collins from OK who can play NT or DE. Ian Williams and Dorsey have been injury prone.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta sure, I'm think more like a guy to replace Aldon if they don't resign him. Shane Ray/Vic Beasley guys.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta yeah, and he's shown that if he sees a guy (Eric Reid) he wants, he will go get him.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 the value in the d-line or pass rusher is in round one, drop off at those positions after that. WR is deep.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 I really love DGB at 15, and I hope Baalke pulls the trigger. I just think he will see value in WR later.
@chazk802 but it sounds like Brown's knee injury was pretty gruesome, he will likely go undrafted
@chazk802 yeah, I'm a big Oregon fan. Ekpre-Olomu is going to be awesome, but he's too small for Baalke. The TE Brown is intriguing to me.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 We are on the same page about what we want Baalke to do, I'm all in on a top WR in round 1.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta I don't think he is. He wasn't even the best d-linemen on Oregon's team last year. He's a solid player, not a star.
@AJGullotta I don't disagree with you. I'm a huge Oregon fan, and I don't like Armstead.
@AJGullotta yeah, who they target in round 1 is not information they will leak. Baalke is unpredictable.
@AJGullotta that doesn't mean he's taking one round 1.
@chazk802 right, but that group is much better if there is a for sure #1 CB on one side.
@AJGullotta yeah, all the reports don't come from Baalke. WR class is deeper than d-line/PR.
@Tre9er you think so?
I could be satisfied with Trae Waynes at 15. Still think Baalke goes d-line/pass rusher.
@Tre9er you are a glutton for punishment.
@JoeGoodberry whoa! What's the opposite of light on your feet? 3 year old stomping temper tantrum?
@49ersGab St. Louis at #10 is the ideal spot to trade up to have a chance at 2/3 top WRs. I doubt a trade with division foe is likely.
@BayAreaFan2 @TheFranchize55 @MistaFrisco @Niners_indeed @EricG_SF49 @Tre9er I will call my agent
@Tre9er @BayAreaFan2 @MistaFrisco @Niners_indeed @TheFranchize55 @EricG_SF49 I'm not bothered to lose, but I didn't want to lose to Tre
Once this Blazer team really gels with Arron Afflalo, they are gonna be really good. #ripcity
@BayAreaFan2 @MistaFrisco @Niners_indeed @TheFranchize55 @EricG_SF49 @Tre9er I hope you're being sarcastic.
@BayAreaFan2 @MistaFrisco @Niners_indeed @TheFranchize55 @EricG_SF49 @Tre9er not sure how I made this list, definitely not voting for myself
@Tre9er I'd probably say Parker.
@Tre9er but, @nfldraftscout had him #1 all along!
@chazk802 @KevinAMolina85 @SakamotoRyan Baalke wan't the GM in 2010 officially, but he ran the draft that year. SM left in March 2010
@chazk802 15 is a great spot to pick IMO, within range to go up and get a top 10, and good spot to trade back
@chazk802 right. However, you've invested in Kap going forward so you want to set him up for success. When we won, Kap was playing well
@EddieTheCommish @chazk802 yes, I agree. Its been a horrible last 3-4 months.
@chazk802 that's what I expect. Hardy, Perriman, Lockett type guys
@EddieTheCommish @chazk802 yes, the media will have a fit. Maybe Jed enjoys that part!
@EddieTheCommish @chazk802 and he's been throwing to DGB this offseason. I really like the idea.
@chazk802 I don't think Baalke takes Armstead, I think pass rusher like Dante Fowler, Shane Ray, or Vic Beasley
@SakamotoRyan and I don't think any of them are available at 15.
@MadSports8 he's nearly as big as Jameis
@Tre9er yeah, figured that out. Thanks.
@MockingTheDraft went to my sons high school and was a fantastic wrestler.
@Tre9er that deep catch vs Ohio St. was very nice. Created good separation with his hips and hands, high pointed ball and shielded defender
@Tre9er also, LONG arms, tons of length.
@Tre9er I really like his body control and ability to adjust.
@Tre9er there were a couple of under thrown balls that were on the ground a yard in front of him, and he nearly got them falling down
@BayAreaFan2 would love that guy, just not sure the Niners invest in TE that high. 6 TE's on the roster.
@Tre9er hey thanks! I'm a little surprised you rated Funchess so high on hands, I think he's mostly solid but had some moments.
@TheRealTimmyP @DeSimone_80 I highly doubt it, Niners have 6 TE's on their roster right now, mid to late round TE is my guess.
@BayAreaFan2 yeah, it will come down to team fit. Wouldn't surprise me if Cooper was picked 3rd.
@BayAreaFan2 not sure he gets past the Jets at 6. If teams are watching his 2013 tape, he's gonna go high.
@DeSimone_80 and then he ran a 4.77 on his second attempt. Still doesn't mean a ton.
@Tre9er Clive Walford has 34" arms, that's a Baalke guy!
@BayAreaFan2 totally, 40 isn't everything, tape is more important IMO. Just good timing with what I was watching :)
@49ersGab @Tre9er a little smaller than DGB. 6'4" 230.
@49ersGab @Tre9er wouldn't surprise me if the team that drafts him uses him in some h-back situations.
@49ersGab @Tre9er I think most have him at WR. Certainly has the skills to play outside.
@BayAreaFan2 and just ran a 4.9 40.
@NinersDan exactly, would love to have Duke
@NinersDan wouldn't be surprised if Baalke gets a homerun guy in the draft to compliment Hyde and Hunter
@BayAreaFan2 @Tre9er oh, I don't see Funchess as a TE, he's got talent to be outside as WR. I don't like TE in rnd 1 at all.
I don't think Gore coming back to the Niners will come down to money, it will come down to his role.
@BayAreaFan2 @Tre9er exactly! When I watched the tape he doesn't look like what I've read.
@BayAreaFan2 @Tre9er he used his hands well against Ohio St. to create separation, and used his body well to shield for ball
@BayAreaFan2 @Tre9er interesting. I thought he fought through tight coverage well vs Ohio St and ND. Wish he was more physical blocking
@BayAreaFan2 @Tre9er expand on that, why?
@Tre9er I didn't expect to like Funchess, and I was pleasantly surprised. I would be happy if he was a Niner
@Tre9er yeah, I see that too
@Tre9er I think his game is comparable to DGB, but Funchess isn't as good after the catch and DGB takes more plays off.
@Tre9er I think his tape stands up with the top 3, except that he seemed to have a few balls bounce off his hands. I bet he runs 4.5s.
@Tre9er that's my first grade attempt, it is kind of arbitrary in the sense that I haven't calibrated. But overall I like Funchess.
@Tre9er also, it looks like he could become a great blocker, seems willing
@Tre9er interesting exercise, I'd like to see how you graded him
@Tre9er catch radius - 9 - long and it shows, able to get to some balls most cant, even pulled a some off the ground a yard in front of him.
@Tre9er ...didn't face much press and often allowed the underneath catch. Uses his hands well in and out of cuts to separate
@Tre9er versatility to get open - 7 this is hard to read, he's very rarely covered up, worked from slot or stacked formations....
@Tre9er hands - 7 - he is a true hands catcher, but dropped some balls that hit him in the hands, didn't see many body catches.
@Tre9er ballskills - 8 - highpoints the ball and adjusts well in the air, adjusts to under thrown balls well, good body control
@Tre9er quickness - 6 again, for his size seems to change direction quickly in routes, but not much wiggle or YAC
@Tre9er speed - 8 esp considering his size, looks like he takes a few strides to get to full speed, not sudden. DB's gave him nice cushion.
@Tre9er ok, but I can't just give a score, I feel I need to explain it too.
@Tre9er hands catcher too. He surprised me a little when I watched some of his videos. I've warmed up. Don't like him at 15, but 20 maybe.
@Tre9er there is no way I'm qualified to grade him, but I expected him to be stiff because he played TE. He's pretty fluid.
@IanKenyonNFL @nfldraftscout wasn't Barkevious Mingo about that size when he came out?
@Tre9er @49ersHub eh, it could be better :)
@Tre9er yeah, a big guy. His body looks like Aldon Smith to me a little. Long arms, angular.
@Tre9er Funchess slightly less too.
@49ersHub and his size likely means hes no higher than round 2
@49ers_Source yeah, I wish we didn't give up the 1st round pick, but it's a good move.
@hudd07 @grantmp1 I agree. I think the WR depth in this draft is tempting enough for Baalke to go DL/pass rush in rnd 1
@MRHawkins49 especially with Aldon's future being in flux.
@MRHawkins49 although, I really like DGB at 15. Not sure they do it though.
@grantmp1 @hudd07 the more I consider it, the more I like DGB at 15. His brother moved in with him at OK and set him straight.
@MRHawkins49 and the WR depth is exactly why I expect Baalke to draft D-line or pass rusher in round 1.
@MRHawkins49 agree. 3 guys at the top, a couple more 1st rnders, and good depth in middle rounds.
@E_Words backup for Wes. I think Alonzo Gee is a nice piece too, shoots 3 well.
@49ers_Source Well, there you have it. Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee.
@JmeMiller1974 @DerekLeeman by def. 2 it's literally okay to use the word literally in a figurative way for effect. #dumb
@JmeMiller1974 @DerekLeeman Webster's added a definition based on how people use the word literally. 
@JmeMiller1974 @seancca @Tre9er @hudd07 but if it is true that JH scheduled practice so no players or coaches could attend, I'd be pissed.
@JmeMiller1974 @seancca @Tre9er @hudd07 The Levi's ribbon cutting ceremony stunt by JH would have been enough for me if I was Owner.
@JmeMiller1974 @seancca @Tre9er @hudd07 it's kind of a perfect storm, and overshadowed by Jed's stupidity.
@JmeMiller1974 @seancca @Tre9er @hudd07 Once the team stopped winning, for a number of reasons, JH wore a little harder and many were done.
@JmeMiller1974 @seancca @Tre9er @hudd07 The feeling I get is that JH wore people down with his personality, and winning covered it up.
@JmeMiller1974 @seancca @Tre9er @hudd07 I absolutely agree that the bad '14 season doesn't mean JH on decline.
@monstr77 no, but I could see them cutting Stevie.
@ElChappo9 meh. I'd like to see a black helmet with an all red uni and gold accent.
@monstr77 and I think there is good middle round value on WR. Some nice pass rush prospects in middle of round 1.
@monstr77 plus, I bet we get another veteran WR like Brandon Marshall, so he doesn't feel WR is priority. 2-4th round I bet.
@monstr77 oh, no. I LOVE Parker. I just don't think they are on the board by 12 or 13. Probably have to go up to 8 to have a choice of them
@monstr77 but I still think Baalke takes D-line/pass rusher in first round.
@monstr77 man, I'm not sold on him. He takes a LOT of plays off. I'd rather have Funchess I think.
@DeSimone_80 many thought Stephen Hill was that guy too
@timkawakami @MikeSilver @MaioccoCSN That section of the article is linked to a different article in which he does give you credit
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 I didn't say there were good reasons, just more than Jed vs JH. More like coaches vs FO.
@hudd07 @JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er to an extent, yes. JH rubbed many the wrong way, which is partially why he is such a good coach.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 no doubt many players were upset. Again, I'm just saying it's not as black and white.
@JmeMiller1974 @hudd07 right, not denying that. Believe me, there is plenty of story that hasn't been told yet. We will hear more over time.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 there have been some whispers of FO staffers being uncomfortable around JH. Vernon held out, and wont for JT
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 I don't think Jed is the only one who wanted JH gone. Some players likely did, and many FO staffers
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 I'm not excusing Jed, I just think the story is much deeper than most people know.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 what evidence do you have other than reports and leaks? That's hardly evidence.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 You are assuming Jed is the only reason Harbaugh is gone. I'm just not sure we can say that.
@JmeMiller1974 @Tre9er @hudd07 The success was only sustainable as long as JH was tolerated. The fact that he's gone is the proof.
@JmeMiller1974 it's a coping method to help people be more optimistic about the new staff. In time most will remember him fondly.
@49ers_Source no. I'd like him back, don't think the money will match what he gets from somewhere else.
@Tre9er well, he is basically Vince Lombardi.
@49ers_Source would you rather trade Barton, T-Rob, &amp; a 1st rounder for Chandler? Or sign Tayshaun Prince when Boston buys him out?
@49ers_Source they play different positions. CJ is a 2, sometimes a 1. Chandler plays the 3 sometimes the 4.
@49ers_Source right, but my point is, he won't compete with CJ for minutes.
@49ers_Source Isn't Chandler like Dorell Wright, a 3 who can play some stretch 4?
@49ers_Source what does Chandler offer that we don't have? He's not a great 3pt shooter, his defense is ok, he's an above average rebounder
@49ers_Source Chandler just doesn't get me excited
@49ers_Source then we have two SF's and potentially no starting SG
@49ers_Source sure, but at what cost? I don't think I want to give up a 1st round pick considering the unsettled future of the starters.
@49ers_Source yep. I won't be surprised if they make a move, but I don't expect it. Olshey wants to keep the cap flexibility for next year
@MRHawkins49 his catch radius helps Kap immensely
@MRHawkins49 not a fan of Armstead?
@MRHawkins49 that's true.
@MRHawkins49 I like the NT from Oklahoma, reminds me of Poe. Takes some plays off, so did Poe.
@Christian_Gin boy, talk about a guy who could play that Deliane Walker TE role...and probably at a decent price.
@rebdab @AnthonyLy49 I've even started pouring my bottles into a pint glass.
@rebdab @AnthonyLy49 well, don't drink it from a can, pour it in a pint glass. Preferably a chilled pint glass.
@AnthonyLy49 @rebdab smash the can on your head and punch someone.
@rebdab @Tre9er @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 lots of small breweries are doing cans now, cheaper and better for the beer.
@monstr77 @Tre9er @DK_England look out for Funchess too, he's gonna blow up the combine.
@Tre9er @DK_England it's a great year, cause those top three are so closely graded. Just a matter of preference. Cautiously optimistic.
@rebdab @Tre9er @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 probably, but I haven't had it.
@DK_England @Tre9er me neither. However, Baalke did trade up pretty far for Eric Reid.
@DK_England @Tre9er 15 sets up nicely for one of the beefy D-line guys.
@DK_England @Tre9er I don't think one of the top 3 WR will be available at 15. Probably have to go up to get one.
@JohnMiddlekauff or York did.
@rebdab @Tre9er @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 ugh, Dales is what I meant.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 those are all breweries, not just tap houses. Most of them are only local.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 but my favorites are in SE - HUB, Gigantic, Hair of the Dog, and Coalition.
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 Then over in NE - Burnside, Fire on the Mountain, Alemeda, Breakside, Laurelwood, and Widmer
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 yep. Deschutes, Rogue, Bridgeport, Fat Head, McMenamins, 10 Barrel - all in walking distance
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 yeah, they have some good stuff.
@JamesBradySBN I've stopped reading articles from his site. He just likes to stir up clicks.
@Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 Dave's Pale Ale (near Denver) is delicious, should be able to get it most places in US
@Tre9er @rebdab @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 One of my other favorite places for beer is Denver. Some incredible small breweries.
@rebdab @Tre9er @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 I know there are great beers in many different places, I couldn't resist a chance to rep PDX.
@rebdab @Tre9er @AnthonyLy49 @Chriscman1 you guys are adorable. Come to Portland and I'll show you what beer is.
@MockingTheDraft I got one just as I read this
@Tre9er he is so sudden once he catches the ball. Not much wiggle, but loads of acceleration.
@49ers_Source yeah, I don't think he's coming back.
@NFLguy07840 @grantmp1 yes that is a possibility. One of the story lines I'm looking forward to this next year.
@Tre9er he is grabby, I really mean his body more than his play. Very long.
@in4td @Tre9er I agree, but Baalke is stubborn enough to stay true to his philosophy.
@in4td @Tre9er maybe, I'm not sure Perriman is a Baalke guy. Baalke seems to like smaller quicker receivers. Justin Hardy maybe.
.@Tre9er CB Trae Waynes from Mich St. looks like a Baalke guy to me. Athletic, can run, LONG arms, aggressive and tough.
@PDXFaithful I wore some Niner gear yesterday to the Multnomah County Court house. Rep'in during jury duty!
@NFLguy07840 @grantmp1 that was a big criticism of Fangio for me. He didn't go for the throat, defense went conservative with a lead.
@in4td @Tre9er solid player, not a first rounder IMO.
@NFLguy07840 @Tre9er in fact, several times I saw Smelter try to catch with his hands, but the ball busts through to his chest. So much VD
@NFLguy07840 @Tre9er yep, we know that problem all to well in Ninerland.
@Tre9er YES! Now I remember, it was Smelter who never caught with his hands!
@Tre9er and CB Ifo Ekpre-Olomu
@renaissancechi ha! Nice try but I already have a hotel, booked by my employer.
@Tre9er cool, I saw similar things.
@Tre9er so...what are your thoughts on him?
@49ers_Source I've been expecting him to be let go. Which is why I did so much salary cap research. Still not sure we keep him.
@49ers_Source I would try to restructure/extend first. One of my favorite all-time 49ers, but I'm prepared to lose him.
@49ersHub @Tre9er @chazk802 I'm pretty excited about Adam Henry. Want to see how he helps Patton and Ellington
I'm planning a trip to Chicago in July. Want to hit a Cubs game, what else should be on my must do list?
@49ersHub @chazk802 @Tre9er so 2nd rd guy?
@49ersHub @Tre9er I can relate. I love using my hips.
@49ersHub @Tre9er well, that really fits. Does he have any down field threat to his game? I guess I'll have to watch some of his video.
@Tre9er @49ersHub it's still very early in the process ;)
@Tre9er @49ersHub Tre, are you crushing on Hardy too? Or haven't settled on your crush yet?
@Tre9er @49ersHub level of competition any concern? Was shut down vs VA Tech...
@49ers_Source right, Baalke is unpredictable. Trade back is his pattern, until Eric Reid.
@Tre9er @49ersHub Baalke seems to like those quick skinny guys, he seems to fit that to some degree.
@49ers_Source yeah, draft picks should come in between 4.5 and 5 mil.
@49ers_Source sure. The 30m number is more a best case scenario. His point was that the cap isn't as big a problem as it looks like
@49ers_Source easy to find money if it's needed. Plus, once Brooks is cut and if Dahl is cut we have about 10 mil in cap room.
@49ers_Source well, mostly restructures I believe. The point is, this cap guy believes the Niners aren't in a bad spot at all.
@49ers_Source yes it could, but I'm told the Niners could get 30 mil under the cap if they want to, VD's deal isn't that pressing.
@49ersHub so what is it that makes him so special? Why are you crushing on him?
@49ers_Source plus, he only has one year left on his deal and only saves about 4 mil if hes cut. I think it makes more sense to keep him.
@49ers_Source I really think he's coming back. I think the FO wants to keep most of this roster in tact if only to prove they can win W/O JH
@jonmbristow and it's your Friday?
@Cianaf should be Kap's backup in SF
@Tre9er thanks! I'm on jury duty today and the videos are blocked, but I will check it out later
@nfldraftscout @Ventimiglia_IV he went to my sons high school, was a hell of a wrestler
@Tre9er nope, just a quick video of cut highlights. I'm new to this, just peeking to see if it might become a new hobby.
@Tre9er ok good. I only watched 6 mins of highlights.
@ConnorsDoscs @AJGullotta @Tre9er yeah. D-line, CB, pass rusher, O-line. Maybe even TE if Vernon is let go.
@Tre9er I feel like he makes a lot if body catches
@ConnorsDoscs @AJGullotta @Tre9er its way too early to say on any of this. Most are still evaluating prospects.
@AJGullotta @ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er an elite WR wasn't necessarily going to help the 2014 season, you are simplifying this too much.
@AJGullotta @ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er I'm not sure how you can definitively say that. So many variables in that game.
@ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er @AJGullotta I agree we need more talent on offense. I just don't think it has to be from a 1st round pick.
@AJGullotta @ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er I don't think the difference in those games is an elite WR.
@AJGullotta @ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er but the Niners nearly won a SB without elite receiving talent as well. 3 NFC championship games
@ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er @AJGullotta Edleman might be elite, he also might benefit a great deal from a great QB and great scheme
@ConnorsDoscs @Tre9er @AJGullotta Seattle won SB without elite receiving talent too. Scheme is very important, playing to players strengths
@49ers_Source yeah, I expect we lose Wes.
@49ers_Source Also, that pick is important as we try to resign LaMarcus, Wes, and Rolo.
@49ers_Source yeah, but Olshey is a great talent evaluator, that pick is worth a lot to us too.
@Christian_Gin good article. I hope we look for a replacement at swing tackle over J-Mart.
@49ers_Source I'm just not sure the Blazers have anything to trade that will bring back more talent. Who do teams want from the Blazers?
@49ers_Source also, Olshey doesn't want to take on any contracts past this year.
@49ers_Source nope. I think chemistry is very important to Olshey/Stotts, they don't want to mess with it.
@AJGullotta @Tre9er I'm not saying I agree with waiting to pick a WR. I'd move up and get white if I could. Baalke doesn't think that way
@AJGullotta @Tre9er perriman has had a solid 2-3 rd grade by many people
@Tre9er I don't think Baalke values WR enough to draft one that high. Probably DB, DL, or OL. Baalke wants to win up the middle.
@Tre9er teams win SBs with QB and scheme. We do need more WR talent, but it doesn't need to be a 1st rd guy.
@Tre9er I'm just not sold we need to get a 1st round WR. Who was the last team to win a SB with a top WR? Colts? Steelers, maybe?
@TheRealTimmyP @grantmp1 yeah, that's wrong. He's 6'3"
@grantmp1 he's not going to blow people away on his 40 I don't think. He's really big though, measurements will be huge.
@grantmp1 but I don't love him at 15
@grantmp1 I love Perriman. Big body, great body control, and fantastic hands catcher
@Tre9er Logan doesn't like traditional west coast, I think he will have a big influence
@DeSimone_80 @112president @nfldraftscout it's only hard in that we don't know how their board stacks up. We do know Baalke is true to board
@blazerbanter Did this kind of collaboration and camaraderie happen last year when Dame was in the competition?
@Christian_Gin @JeffFarrier but Millard played some TE at OK too, maybe he can play Delainie's role.
who knew Luigi played for NC State? 
.@nfldraftscout What are your thoughts on WR Breshad Perriman from UCF?
@NinersDan @Tre9er Perriman's Dad was an NFL receiver, and it shows, he catches with his hands and not his body
@NinersDan @Tre9er Perriman seems to get off the line quickly. Many of his catches were made 3 yards ahead of DB. Not many contested
@NinersDan @Tre9er yes to all those. I liked the adjustments I saw him make. But again, I only a saw highlight cut not full game tape
@Tre9er @cultofmac when NBA season is over, I may just do this!! But I need Comcast sports net for Blazer games, it's the only option.
@Tre9er Perriman seems a little sloppy in his route running, and it sounds like he had a problem with drops last year. I'd like to see more
@Tre9er Breshad Perriman reminds me a little of Kelvin Benjamin. But I only have access to highlights, not game tape.
@Tre9er What about Breshad Perriman? Great size, decent speed and hands, fantastic body control. Adjusts to ball and has big catch radius.
@Christian_Gin sorry, Albert Breer
@Christian_Gin Breed says one will coach outside WR, the other will coach inside WR
@Mr_Portland @E40 ah, I found it. Stadium from 1-3. Hollywood from 4-6.
@Mr_Portland at the Portland Fred Meyer? There only one?
Hey, @espn, How is it that a game the @trailblazers win is reported using 85% Houston highlights? Pathetic. 
@VincentFrankNFL @9ersEv most of what was played at the Grammy's wasn't the best, but there were some excellent performances too
@9ersEv @VincentFrankNFL There are a few mainstream artists that are killing it. Take a listen to Hozier, the whole album.
@9ersEv @VincentFrankNFL I think part of the problem is that no one listens to full length albums any more, mostly singles from iTunes
@9ersEv @VincentFrankNFL but it's much more difficult to make money in music now, and much more difficult to break into mainstream
@9ersEv @VincentFrankNFL not all of it, in fact I think the majority of mainstream music isn't a good example of the rest of the industry.
@VincentFrankNFL has anyone ever thought they were currently living in and era of wonderful music? There is fantastic music being made...
@FO_ScottKacsmar but Sam Smith gave Tom Petty a writing credit when he discovered Stay With Me is basically same melody as Wont Back Down
@FO_ScottKacsmar sort of. In this case Sam Smith is one of the actual writers. Usually the producers/writers get very little credit.
@jenniferleechan and more orange
@FO_ScottKacsmar record is for the technical aspects, not including the performance or lyrics. For the recording itself.
@Ruthless_Sports and she was orange
@JeffFarrier also have to think that the FO has learned from the PR mess of Aldon and Ray. Things will be different IMO.
@JeffFarrier Tomsula more likely to consider the opinions and methods of other coaches.
@JeffFarrier I guess my point is that this coaching staff will collaborate more than the last staff. Harbaugh was a dictator.
@JeffFarrier do you know for sure they didn't do that? and who would be responsible for that, probably HC not position coach.
@JeffFarrier I'm unsure what you think the coaching staff wasn't doing?
@JeffFarrier but the coaches aren't making those bad decisions, they help to rehab when the player goes off the rails.
@JeffFarrier also, I guess I'm not sure what they didn't handle well?
@JeffFarrier maybe you're right, but I'm not sure how much Ray could be helped. Aldon seems to have come a long way.
@DeSimone_80 this is why - 
@NinersNation Good for Ken! And better for the Niners, that Seahawks defensive staff is being gutted.
@49ersHub Draft. Whoever they can get in 1st round at 15 or maybe a light trade back. White, DGB, Devin Smith...
@JeffFarrier two things. 1, that was a different coaching staff. 2, they did help Aldon and Lynch.
@49ers_Source @RickDaMuscle I think the Niners staff is well suited to support a guy like DGB, especially if they take a risk on him early
@49ers_Source @RickDaMuscle the Josh Gordon stuff might scare teams off. They won't want to draft that guy.
@49ers_Source @RickDaMuscle on his talent, yes. Depends on what his coaches have to say about his character.
@RickDaMuscle @49ers_Source Lockett has some inconsistent hands, would be a risk. But at this point we need to take that kind of risk.
@49ers_Source @RickDaMuscle We just need speed on the edges.
@49ers_Source @RickDaMuscle there are a few guys. I would do cartwheels if we get DGB or White. I like Dorsett, Devin Smith, and Lockett.
@49ers_Source @RickDaMuscle would really love a few speedy offensive players. Baalke seems to be good at digging up late round D players
@rebdab @49ersGab Suh is a key piece to help us win with class!
@49ersGab I've been told the Niners could clear up to 30 mil in restructures and releases. It is possible, but not Baalke's style.
@Ruthless_Sports Jason Avant
@chazk802 that's funny.
@BetterRivals Joe Staley thinks Brady's scream was cute
@SakamotoRyan sort of. He played HB and H-back at Oklahoma, then moved to FB. Not a great blocker, more of a runner.
@SakamotoRyan and Tre Millard
@49ersGab simple in thought, not in application :) The new offensive coaches have their work cut out for them.
@49ersGab if the offense plays looser and Kap moves forward.
@rebdab I think it's a great image to promote.
@rebdab some of us actually prefer it!
@Faly88 so delicious. One of my favorite spots.
@Faly88 Tilt has a killer fried chicken breakfast sandwich
@Christian_Gin "He has developed into a decent blocker..." I think Vince was the highest rated blocking TE in the NFL last year before inury
@JmeMiller1974 @AroundTheNFL yes, very different job expectations.
@bomani_jones WE SHOULD AIR DROP SUPPLIES!!
@JmeMiller1974 @AroundTheNFL but, some great position coaches can make great head coaches. We just can't know till we see what happens.
@joshuamcfadden2 @chazk802 @49ersGab kind of a hybrid FB/TE like Deliane Walker played
@joshuamcfadden2 @chazk802 @49ersGab it's not entirely a huge switch, and new coaching staff could mean different things. Millard to H-back
@chazk802 @49ersGab yeah, he was a DE in college.
@DAdeshiyan @chazk802 yeah, he's gonna be fun to watch.
@49ersGab absolutely. But at what point does all that success become about coaching and preparation instead of luck?
@49ersGab maybe. I doubt he leaves money on the table, he's a business first kind of guy.
@49ersGab he's young and raw.
@49ersGab I saw many 3rd and long conversions. Russell's scramble drill does make it hard to evaluate.
@49ersGab I realize numbers aren't high. I'm looking at it anecdotally. They made plays when plays needed to be made.
@49ersGab I hope Jmart is gone, he was horrible this year.
@DAdeshiyan @chazk802 yeah, good runner. His biggest weakness is strength at point of attack on blocking.
@chazk802 well, he won't be a true TE. Will play more of a flexible FB role I bet.
@49ersGab sure. Davis will bounce back, McDonald at least a great blocker. Asante Cleveland is intriguing to me.
@chazk802 yeah, when he was drafted some said Niner fans will fall in love with Millard once he hits the field.
@49ersGab sure, I agree with that. Just seems they get so much production from a group of no names, and we got the opposite.
@chazk802 yeah, good hands. Was an H-back at Oklahoma. More of an H than a FB really.
@49ersGab why is OL #1? We have tons of depth, just need a swing T backup and maybe an interior. Don't forget about Brandon Thomas
@49ersGab Really like Clive Walford from Miami, he's gonna be a 2-3 round guy.
@49ersGab I like a mid to late round TE too, but we have 6 TEs on the roster, and Tre Millard who could play a Delanie Walker type role
@49ersGab yes, love this idea! I think Nate Carroll with Seattle is interesting too. SEA WRs play higher than their talent level.
@49ersGab yes, this team hasn't had a true #1 dominant WR since TO. Need a go to guy for Kap's development IMO. Boldin won't be around long.
@Jay_AB81 @Ninerfan4Martin @NinersNation thank goodness for that carryover cap space!
@chazk802 likely. If Iupati gets an extension it will be for less than the tag. I just don't think we keep him.
@chazk802 they could. I don't think that is Baalke's style though. He drafted Thomas (who is very good) to replace Iupati I think
@nickpepp @chazk802 @CSimmsQB I don't think so, I think the Niners are in save money mode.
This: "@49ersGab: Montana played in an era when running was the key to the game. Corners were more physical. (cont) 
@Tre9er so many guys open on that play.
@Tre9er @DeSimone_80 exactly my point.
@Tre9er @DeSimone_80 and point to the success they have had turning Aldon around.
@Tre9er @StellaLibretto yeah, they follow Bruce Irvin's classy example
@grantmp1 @Tre9er be interesting to see what his 40 time is, he looks super fast
@JmeMiller1974 it comes off as pathetic. It's one thing to be happy, and another to try and add insult to injury.
@Michael_RA @49ers_Source Ken Norton is my guess.
@monstr77 the more I think about it, the less I think it happens. Could restructure though.
@Tre9er Baalke seems to like the smaller quick twitch athletes at receiver, but maybe not this small.

@NFLguy07840 and it's not even a legit statement. Russell doesn't really play vs those QBs, his defense does.
@Tre9er hard to say before FA and draft. Right now I'll take under at 9-7. If we get a #1 WR I may take the over.
@49ers_Source which is a good thing. He wants blood now.
@49ers_Source @in4td @RedGoldBleeder 13 mil for 2 inside backers per year seems like a lot of money to me.
@49ers_Source yeah, but he will probably replace Kobe. It will work out.
@monstr77 lol, we are getting kinda crazy with our arm chair GM ideas. I'm 100% guilty!
@in4td @RedGoldBleeder @49ers_Source not saying we should just dump Willis, but should consider all options and see what market dictates
@in4td @RedGoldBleeder @49ers_Source @NinersNation Willis has been my favorite, only jersey I own, but Baalke needs to be smart.
@RedGoldBleeder @49ers_Source @in4td @NinersNation however, Baalke should still look at options available to move Willis, esp if Bow is back
@49ers_Source @in4td @NinersNation @RedGoldBleeder no question Willis is better than Borland.
@49ers_Source I agree, though I think VD comes back, only 1 year left on his deal.
@Michael_RA @JmeMiller1974 thank you!
@AJGullotta I don't think fanspeak is accurate, but it doesn't matter, cap isn't as bad as I initially thought for sure.
@49ers_Source @AJGullotta I didn't even think about extending Aldon, that would make a big difference.
@AJGullotta However, Jay Hurley said the Niners can clear up to 30 mil with restructures if they want to.
@AJGullotta right I asked for that clarification.
@AJGullotta Jason also said the numbers on OTC do not include a draft picks
@AJGullotta sounds like fanspeak may not be accurate 
@Jay_AB81 well that's comforting.
@Jay_AB81 cap situation looking not so good even after Brooks is cut?
@Jason_OTC so the numbers on fanspeak may not be correct? Looks like the dead money for 49ers on fanspeak is incorrect for 2015.
@Jason_OTC BTW, this is the first time I have really rifled through OTC. It's fantastic, great work!
@Jason_OTC is this simulator accurate? I seem to be getting different numbers on fanspeak than I do at OTC. 
@Jason_OTC right, but that is a general figure that is commonly used.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab I don't know if draft pics are included in total liabilities on OTC, I'm asking.
@Jason_OTC does the salary cap calculator figure 5 mil for draft picks automatically? here - 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab that's fine, I just did it simply to compare figures and they don't match when I make the same moves
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab did no restructures on either site, only cuts to keep it simple
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab the only thing OTC doesn't count is the 3.9 carry over. so that's 6 mil in space, but no draft picks
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab if I cut the same players on fanspeak, I get this 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab On OTC, if I cut Dahl, Brooks, and Martin, this is what I have for 2015 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab but I'm saying it doesn't match what OTC has. Salaries and dead money should be 141 mil after cuts
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab the simulation on OTC's site seems more accurate - 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab I see that, but I think the calculations are wrong. Should have 6.5 mil in dead money.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab can see it here better 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab red means negative, like the saying "in the red"
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab because we have to cut salary to make the projected cap, prorated bonus and salaries change year to year
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab that link is just a list of FA and their salaries. This is the one to use 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab I have what backwards? 2.6 in red means over
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab we are projected to be OVER by 2.6 mil next season. 
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab yeah, we need about 10 mil in space just to resign guys and draft picks
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab we will probable resign Cully or Cox, they don't figure into the cap we've been talking about
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab unless we cut Stevie
@NFLguy07840 @chazk802 @49ersGab actually we have 5 TEs, but none of them produced last year. At least have to add a draft pick
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab yeah we do, we need all of them at least for camp.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta @49ersGab Honestly, I think we are in for some big roster changes. No Gore, Crab, Iupati, hopefully Martin.
@chazk802 @AJGullotta @49ersGab maybe, depends on what he gets offered. Not Baalke's style, more likely to get a veteran who is released
@chazk802 @AJGullotta @49ersGab Would save another 4ish mil if Justin Smith retires
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab also have to remember 9 draft picks, that's at least 5 mil, 500k is min salary, 9 draft picks.
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab Gore will be 3-4 mil by himself. We wont resign Gore I don't think, and only Cully OR Cox
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab Brooks has a bunch of dead money, only gain about 3 - 4 mil of cap cutting him and restructuring Stevie
@AJGullotta @chazk802 @49ersGab We need 2 WRs, a CB, a TE, a swing tackle, and a HB. some of that will be drafted.
@chazk802 @49ersGab well, probably need most of that 10 mil in cap space for rookies. 9 draft picks this year.
@chazk802 @49ersGab could look to trade him to Washington where Scot Mclaughlin landed, he drafted Willis.
@chazk802 @49ersGab trading him makes more sense for the Niners, but other teams wont want Willis on that contract
@chazk802 @49ersGab basically, Pat's contract sets up perfectly to either be extended or cut. I don't like it, but I've seen it coming.
@chazk802 @49ersGab VD would have almost 2.5 mil in dead money that counts against the cap, probably from prorated bonuses
@chazk802 @49ersGab cap number isn't what we save, have to figure in dead money. 
@chazk802 @49ersGab VD isn't going anywhere.
@chazk802 @49ersGab if restructure Stevie, cut Brooks and Willis, they would be about 10 mil under cap, which isn't much.
@chazk802 @49ersGab They will get rid of Brooks, but VD saves half as much as Willis, about 4 mil.
@chazk802 @49ersGab Niners save almost 7.5 mil if they cut/trade Willis, less than 1 mil if they cut/trade Bow
@chazk802 @49ersGab it sucks, Willis is one of my favs, but it makes the most sense to move on from him. Creates cap space.
@JmeMiller1974 @Michael_RA ok, I remember the article, must have missed that part.
@chazk802 @49ersGab I can't imagine we go into the season with Bow, Willis, and Borland on the roster.
@JmeMiller1974 interesting. I hadn't heard that. Who did you hear that from?
@JmeMiller1974 York's wanting to save/make more money is not equal to a cash flow problem. They have a crap ton of money.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 You need to use some Shakey Graves for a pod cast - 
@Tre9er haha, nope, I'm here.
.@bomani_jones I think @allen_stone should be the face of Soul, if he's not already. 
@ikegraul @Dame_Lillard @NBA indeed. A popularity contest.
@Tre9er It's always nice to find allies in this big crazy world.
@Tre9er lol, sorry. I got distracted and forgot to come back to this thread. I am a believer, I even have a degree in Bible.
@pattonoswalt it's a beautiful day to be out and about in downtown PDX!
@vw55to07 I don't think basic customer service is too much to expect
@vw55to07 wow, you have had a helluva time with those guys.
@Tre9er yeah, we have a worship band too.
@Tre9er yeah, probably so. I wrote a song about whiskey, but we haven't recorded it yet.
@EddieTheCommish @Tre9er I'm pretty new to percussion, I'm actually a keys player who was asked to play drums. Go easy on me...
@Tre9er I play drums in a delta blues/americana band 
@Tre9er oh man, I love his style. That southern roots/blues stuff is my jam.
@Tre9er No, but I will now.
@Tre9er I think their live stuff is better than the recorded stuff, lots of nuance. 
@Tre9er oh yeah, Wood Brothers are solid!
@MadSports8 I'll set the over/under at 4 glasses of whiskey. I'll take the over.
@MadSports8 Prediction: I will be drinking
@nfldraftscout DON'T TELL ANYONE!!! He needs to be available at 15.
@Tre9er @NinersNation #teacher with class
@NinersDan @Tre9er agreed. Kap seems more genuine. Russell is hiding something.
@in4td @NFLguy07840 I've heard it said that JT is a most detail oriented coach. Coaches players what to do on every down and distance
@Tre9er you aren't the only one who expected it.
@BetterRivals the Steve Logan stuff was great, has me fired up!
Geep it is, I don't like it, but #goniners
@Matt36603807 @Tre9er @RedGoldBleeder "red flags in...preparation and teaching in more of the "classroom setting" during the offseason"
@Matt36603807 @Tre9er @RedGoldBleeder this is an interesting read on what happened in Tampa 
@Matt36603807 @Tre9er @RedGoldBleeder HE'S HIRED!!!
@monstr77 @RedGoldBleeder Ugh, doesn't excite me any more than Geep. Also, Alex Van Pelt was on that staff in Tampa.
@RedGoldBleeder OK, dark horse candidate. Jeff Jagodzinski. Coached with Logan at BC and Tampa. Coaching in college now.
@FirstTeamTommy @Tre9er maybe if Kap was shorter, had a fro, was divorced, and went to children's hospitals everyday
@FirstTeamTommy @Tre9er it's less about his tats and more about the direction his hat faces. If the new coach can get his hat forward = wins
@Tre9er Need to have Kap fake hand off, fake throw, turn and run like hell every 3 plays. Oh, and more flea-flickers and bubble screens.
@Tre9er but no one knows as much about coaching this team as I do, and I know these coaches aren't the right hires.
@SakamotoRyan Steve Logan is now being reported as QB coach, seems highly likely we are headed for a Geep offense.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 right, that's why I said "block" with quotations.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 ok, right. After national signing day. Gotta get "Blocked" by all the college options next.
@grantmp1 sure, I get it. That would be a dream come true. Hell, Malzahn as HC would have been a dream come true.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 before the Super Bowl?
@grantmp1 Bwahahaha!! That's so not happening.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 I'd take Sparano as OC and Geep at TEs. But again, not ideal. Rather have an outside OC hire.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 that's the big $ question. I think I read it in a MM article. Seems that Steve Logan will be QB coach.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 yeah, I'd actually prefer Sparano as OC over Geep. But I've read the team doesn't want Geep back as QB coach
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 I wouldn't be excited about Geep, but I think we could do worse. The good thing is the solid O staff behind him.
@monstr77 @RedGoldBleeder Mike Shanahan wasn't ever a legit option. I think his name was leaked by FO to draw interest in the job.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 Bicknell might be like Rathman and not want an OC job yet. It's just not that black and white.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 and I'm not sure people turning down the Niners is as bad as it seems. Chud got good offer...
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 there are only 32 OC jobs. Someone is interested.
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 Heck, they'd be foolish not to talk to someone on the Seattle offensive staff, even if only for some intel
@49ers_Source @BayAreaFan2 Brian Dabol, possibly a college guy
@JmeMiller1974 eh, I kinda think Chud was plan A. Interest in Bicknell was reported a couple weeks ago. Plan C, Geep is last option.
@DeSimone_80 maybe. Don't the players love Jimmy T? isn't the perspective of players very different than coaches?
@BayAreaFan2 I think it's pretty clear they don't want to give an internal guy the job though. Still some good options to explore.
@BayAreaFan2 I'm not horribly worried. This has been embarrassing for sure, but Geep and Sparano both qualified as OCs if needed.
@BayAreaFan2 absolutely! And likely interest existed but the way Harbaugh was handled has scared people off.
@BayAreaFan2 so why is it you think they don't have that?
@BayAreaFan2 that would have been tampering
@MRHawkins49 @Tre9er @49ers24_7 @NinersNation we will have to change the team name to the San Francisco 49er Dragons
@monstr77 @BetterRivals I don't think Geep was the primary guy for OC, plan C.
@BetterRivals @monstr77 I like the Logan hire. He with Geep and Sparano are versatile. Can coach multiple positions.
@BetterRivals @monstr77 also, I have read that Tomsula wants Eagles WR coach Bob Bicknell. But I'm not sure if he's under contract or not
@BetterRivals @monstr77 likely. Geep as OC, Logan as QB. No idea who is WR coach.
@monstr77 @BetterRivals depends. If Geep is OC, could be Logan, could be someone who is not on staff yet. If hire a different OC, it's Geep
@monstr77 @BetterRivals Curry could just remain as a quality control coach.
@monstr77 @BetterRivals I don't think Curry gets a QB job before an NFL WR job.
@monstr77 @BetterRivals Curry played QB, yes. Also played basketball.
@BetterRivals I've heard it reported, I think from Barrows but could have been MM, that the team doesn't see Curry as WR coach.
@BetterRivals Logan has experience as WR coach as well
@ChrisBiderman @NinersNation because every time she gets hot, he beats her with a shovel.
@ChrisBiderman @NinersNation why can't Smokey the Bear and Mrs. Smokey the bear have babies?
@monstr77 technically QB coach is vacant too. Christ hasn't been named to a position.
@JmeMiller1974 gotchya. Yeah, this is bad. Time to panic.
@JmeMiller1974 who will be spinning it? 49ers will just deny Chud was a target.
How I did on Twitter this week: 65 Mentions, 75.4K Mention Reach, 15 Retweets. How'd your week go? via 
@nickpepp he probably lives out there too
@nickpepp what high school?
@mikegrich this is why there is a show about us.
@VincentFrankNFL it's already legal in Washington
@mikerice6 Barton. Can't start Crabbe while LMA is out, need the offensive production Barton can bring.
@jonmbristow but that ball looks regulation
@Tre9er @NinersNation 16-0!!!
@49ers_Source yeah, but he can only do so much. Teams will roll defense to him. Other guys like Kaman, CJ, and Batum need to step up.
@49ers_Source well, it's gonna take a few games for them to figure out how to run the offense without LaMarcus.
@49ers_Source really concerned about Batum, seemed to aggravate that wrist last night. Hopefully we get ROLO back before the All-Star game
@grantmp1 @TheRealTimmyP at first I wasn't sure if it was real or a spoof. So much fun to watch.
@TheRealTimmyP oh right, I agree with that. That's why I asked what round Cobb is projected.
@TheRealTimmyP well, that wont happen because it was on Harbaugh. And, who knows, maybe Hunter isn't himself.
@nfldraftscout they do need one, especially if Gore doesn't come back. What round grade do you have on Cobb?
@Tre9er right. They do that on purpose.
@Tre9er reviews. After about 3 months the foam will break down a little and soften up.
@Tre9er Slightly concerned about durability and longevity. They are too new to know how long these mattresses will last.
@Tre9er it may be a month till we get one, but I will keep you up to date. Love these memory foam direct options now.
@Tre9er @MRHawkins49 Barrows mentioned Bicknell was on Tomsula's radar, citing his familiarity with him in NFLE.
@bomani_jones Especially in a league that is trying to be the standard for diversity and acceptance. This is vastly inappropriate.
@bomani_jones I think you could call that sexual harassment, and it's not funny, it's immature.
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 Fewell is a big deal. That D staff will have tons of smarts and experience. But, will it translate to effectiveness
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 agreed. I think the Shanahan stuff was leaked to show interest in the job.
@JmeMiller1974 sure. Thanks for the conversation. Just want to understand your perspective. Like you said, you are passionate, and it shows.
@JmeMiller1974 I live a charmed life, but the teams I root for can't seem to win a championship. I'm a glutton for sports punishment
@JmeMiller1974 ah, I see. This is an important part of fandom. We get to express and feel emotion we don't get in other places. Makes sense.
@JmeMiller1974 I agree. I don't consider hope/joy equal to happiness.
@JmeMiller1974 I think, if I lost hope and joy as a fan, I would just stop caring about the team. This is what happened to me with Baseball.
@JmeMiller1974 but, do you have any reason to be hopeful? Isn't this taking the joy out of being a fan?
@JmeMiller1974 you absolutely should express your discontent with the team, that is how teams know what fans like/want.
@MRHawkins49 I don't expect it to be as good as it has been, but I expect it to be very good still. Will be more aggressive.
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 don't forget that Baalke ran the 2010 draft too. A-Davis, Iupati, Bowman, Boobie
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 that action alone says volumes about how Harbaugh was going to act towards FO. The relationship was gone.
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 Harbs scheduled practice during the Levi's ribbon cutting ceremony. No coaches or players went to it.
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 agreed, but no GM hits 100%. Baalke has a good track record.
@JmeMiller1974 @chazk802 I don't think Baalke missed on the 2013 draft. Several contributors from that draft. Some that will blossom soon.
@Tre9er I think we are gonna give this a try, reviews say it's a little softer than Casper. 
@Tre9er good to know, I've heard it softens up. You have to keep it for at least 60 days too, I think, before you can return it.
@Tre9er done, and done
@Tre9er so do I retweet or fav this?
@MRHawkins49 he's been rumored as WR coach due to connections with Tomsula. I wonder if his contract is up.
@EddieTheCommish @SakamotoRyan I do wonder how much impact mr. conservative Harbaugh had to do with the ST performance.
@NFLguy07840 this catch is one of my most vivid memories of the good years.
@Tre9er @SakamotoRyan Tim K said Mangini was all Harbaugh. Harbs had to talk Baalke into it.
@EddieTheCommish @SakamotoRyan the return game wasn't really good with Seely either.
@CoryR49 to do what? DC been filled, he ain't jumping for lateral position, and we already have a LB coach.
@PriscoCBS Ryan Mallett
@SakamotoRyan right. New OC could bring own QB coach which would leave Geep to fill WR or he could be out.
@SakamotoRyan QB coach too?
@Tre9er looks likely that Geep is at least staying as QB coach. He's never been a WR coach.
@monstr77 Barrows wrote that the team isn't looking at Curry as WR coach, probably quality control.
@Christian_Gin knowing the season he had I wouldn't be surprised if he redoes his deal for more years and less money
@monstr77 Geep has never been a WR coach, and I tend to think he's too experienced to be quality control. Could still let him go.
@monstr77 who would be QB coach?
@JmeMiller1974 I would have been behind a Sparano for OC push, this is even better.
@VincentFrankNFL nope, it's an awesome hire. whiny Niner fans need to take a twitter break for the sake of the rest of us.
@monstr77 I still think the DC will be someone else. A position coach getting first crack at DC like Vance Joseph would have been.
@NFLguy07840 make him and Vince bury a football from last season
@49ers_Source and Geep Chryst to remain the QB coach
@DK_England now if Jimmy T can get him to show is chest hair, we have a Tomsula and Sparano roaming the sidelines
@DK_England wonder if he will be a 1 year rental, on to OC somewhere next year. Good hire for his HC experience, can help Tomsula
@49ers_Source he plays pretty tough, but can't grit it out.
@49ers_Source Freeland seems to need longer recovery time than he should. I hate to question his toughness, but...
@49ers_Source at least we got some much needed production from Batum last night.
@49ers_Source would help to get Rolo or Freeland back. Rolo has at least 2 more weeks, Freeland might be gone for a while.
hey, @49ers_Source, not looking good for LaMarcus - 
@webmusicguy I don't think that would hit the WNBA demographic
@NinersNation @davidneumann_ I like the @TheDDSshow suggestion: #shrinkage
@CHold @pdxbrocialite @Forbes lol, Heat. Second largest bandwagon fan base in America. Now that Bron gone, it gonna change.
@NFLguy07840 @thefootballgirl me neither. I booked a beach house the weekend of SB. I'm not watching it.
@Tre9er @TheJasonNeal Great opening song, and very appropriate!!
@MRHawkins49 is this just a hunch?
So the band I play in, @NicodemusSnow, was on @kinkradio tonight. It was quite the surprise! 
@49ersHub except that BY is a pretty solid D-line coach at Florida. The other two just talk.
@49ersHub @Tre9er I think he was doing the dougie
@RedGoldBleeder @NinersNation this would be my favorite move in a long time. The fans LOVE BY.
@Tre9er @FalconsM5 yep, Colts don't currently have anyone listed as Assistant HC.
@monstr77 @49ers_Source maybe keep same title but add Assistant Head Coach, they don't list an Assistant HC.
@rickgasko at a family/church Super Bowl party. We painted our chests, I was 14.
@Tre9er the only real concern is his speed?
@NikkiW_49 Pretty sure I'm guilty of this, even more so IRL. I'm a recovering masculinist. Sorry.
@monstr77 @49ers_Source eh, it will be ok, I have an awesome wife.
