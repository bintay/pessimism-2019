Some mages buff, heal, debuff, encourage, manipulate.

I am not one of those mages. 
@St_Chappers thanks :)
each of these have been roughly 20-25 mins so far.
todays speedpaint, had a rough start, restarted a few times, compositionally has issues but fun playing with lighting 
Next time I'm asking them to hold it til weekend cos goddam

Tonights progress with brushes should help with these, the ones used above were too soft and fuzzy
Speedpaints, one done yesterday before bed, the snow one done during lunch. about 25 mins each. Getting hang of this. 
An evening of practicing with photoshop brushes. kinda like the square chalk one. Also nooo opacity pressure control only flow. Flow is best
I am never going to play FNAF so I'm watching @markiplier do so instead. :D

@4J_ChrisReeves Let player make plot or tactical decisions through coversation but have the player snark, be a jerk or nice based on that
RPG idea: Instead of multiple dialogue options, you decide your personality at start of game and your choices are made for you based on that
enough politics. Videogames!
So the average joe in the street thinking Tories and Labour are all the same will be more correct than ever.
So with the shortlist of candidates for leadership what's going to happen is even more of a lurch to the right with Tory and UKIP success
In fact it's nice the papers are all laying into the party now over "failed leftist politics" despite Labour's support for Austerity.
I love how arseholes like Alan Sugar are jumping the Labour ship because it wasnt "Pro Business" enough. Good fucking riddance.

@lizaledwards I am a gigantic metal gear fan yet since MGS3 the series objectification of women has gone from lame to utterly silly.

Work tmo. I Have No Time Yet I Must Draw
i was going to go to bed but then i found a speedpaint dem and now i have something new to do on my lunch coffee breaks

also it late now
I keep wanting to be optimistic and hopeful to distraught people about the future of the UK and it's getting far tougher than i imagined.
Logitech g402 so far: very nice mouse. v shallow and quiet L/r-click, easy to reach alternate buttons, very light, glides so nicely.
@floofyscorp literally blood on Tory hands and people wonder why I've no tolerance for liberal middle grounders. How many more have died.
I have no interest in Splatoon (cute art tho) but no voice chat is for the best, really. You don't want trashtalkers in that game
that wasn't me please disregard the flamethrower in my hand why are you looking at me like that? 
help 
@floofyscorp 
Eh, that'll do 
@St_Chappers good call! Will do
En route to maplins cos fuck tolerating an old malfunctioning mouse
my old mx518 mouse is finally giving up the ghost, keeps not registering clicks or clicks as doubleclicks.
well deserved :D 
@floofyscorp her face was wigging out all throughout the sequence and im scared
WHY IS LELIANA SINGING WHAT IS HAPPENING AAAAAA 
@floofyscorp or indeed if Maya has them, I did OK with the mouse flick menus after a while
@floofyscorp I totally so do this as well BTW ;-;
@floofyscorp max
£65 to fix my brakes ahaha....*pays*
Art supply shop on Perth road opposite the Kwik fit! Score!
off i go to halfords again, now to fix my bike brakes which are more of a suggestion to slow down rather than STOP NOW.
@lizaledwards you did, in fact, ask for this. #cyborg
I am so bad for accidentally fav/RTing stuff then reversing that, same with deleting tweets so I can edit spelling. :S
@IrradiatedCat must be Friday then :-I
@Danger_Kennedy also the wee grey archer toy gift you can give him to play with dawwww he's so excited when he gets it.

@floofyscorp keep checking my parents constituency, dreading they're going to swing UKIP, seeing as my parents said they're voting for them
@floofyscorp also comforting schadenfreude over the Lib Dems, as productive and helpful as that isn't. :-I
There are now more Giant Pandas in Scotland than Labour MPs. #GE2015 
Remember this feeling right now, get furious and stay furious, organise, register with a party, make powerful people afraid of you.
The English can recover from this Labour can change, but it's not going to do it under Milliband or any other milquetoast tory-lite shithead
In wake of the no vote in #indyref I dove straight to cynicism. Then I saw the positivity of organised angry Scots now brought to fruition.
@terry_goodwin I'd rank those in ascending order of political power, majority fooled by a dominated media run by the selfish for the evil
@terry_goodwin I know man. I know :(
@terry_goodwin cannot emphasise quite how happy I am to see this cataclysmic rise in the SNP vote, but still, god fucking damn England.
oh well, guess among friends I now have to deal with being the literal Bringer of Tories because I didn't fall in line and vote Labour.
Tip for #Labour. This whole Be Tories Lite thing clearly isn't working. Consider going full Nye Bevan, firebrand leftie again.
I desperately hope I'm wrong on this.
Sorry to Scots down south but I can see Scotland + its people being vilified by English people for the Tories the English voted for.#GE2015
fuckit going to bed, see you when the lizard overlords claim the day again
paxman comedy is weapons grade cringe
Sunderland despite being a safe labour seat shows an interesting swing. Lib Dem wipeout and UKIP rising to second biggest party...
@terry_goodwin oh exit poll, I see what you mean, oh well. polls are polls, it's not over yet.
#milibae :-I 
@floofyscorp hope they're letting the people at the back of the queues know that.
lol widespread reports of extensively long queues half an hour before the polls close good job leaving it to the last minute guys! #GE2015
Not to mention game is having a tiring habit of magically spawning enemies in a perfect circle around you after a dialogue.
what's that werewolves have an overpower ability that instakills any of my characters. cool brah.

@lizaledwards sweet fucking jesus ouch
mental selfie of me right now 
@Danger_Kennedy Yeah, I've even played gta:london, my beef is that it was done with the sensitivity of a brick + defended publicly as satire
@floofyscorp Lib Dems more like "Due to them my piss has been boiling since fucking 2010 and doing double duty as Xenomorph acid blood."
BYE. 
No, you know what I'm not giving this game any more of my time.
fucking hell GTA5.
Oh but there's a cocky spelling out from Trevor all TOTURE R BAD IT DUN WORK long after the actual torture sequence itself? fucking hell
What kind of piece of shit writes a mission where you literally waterboard an west asian american and call it satire?
Well, took me a year to get to it but every last person who shit on Rockstar for that torture mission is absolutely fucking justified.

@Danger_Kennedy suuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfaaaaaaaaceeeee <SKULL>
Actually, I don't mind it so much when it's being somewhat serious but the comedy is   forced and dumb and yeah yeah jokes I get it.
This entire game is just a freely explorable wonder and tech marvel, I just can't abide the writing.
OK GTA5. you win, I sang along. 
@Danger_Kennedy stats for cats, agent. stats for cats.


@Danger_Kennedy cats

Low FoV settings + banning for FoV mods is exclusionary towards motion-sick players. It's just like removing subs and colour blind modes.
So hey @RockstarGames, the #GTA5PC maximum FoV setting is too low. High FoV isn't cheating, it stops people like me getting motion sickness.
so happy about #YookaLaylee being funded so bloody fast. hope major publishers are taking notice at this democratisation of game approvals
Once told a guy I lived in Scotland, he had no idea Scotland existed. He was japanese and this was at a public bath in Kyoto. :v
#YookaLaylee reached funding target in 40 minutes. My God. 

I'm backing it anyway :v

Feel like I'm doing good avoiding going on about politics, esp 6 days from the election. Elect anyone but Tories please. Come on UK, do this
@Gingerhazing which one is the woman? #poopdle
and I'm at the point of the series where garnet has more than one line per episode :v
Mostly sure if someone made a word cloud of Stephen Universes' lines in the show the word "Wooooaaaaooooohh" would be like 8 times biggest.

dragon age origins is a really great game y'all :D
The fact the guy questioned my leadership and swung massive hammer at my mage head may have contributed to this...

@Danger_Kennedy he showed a mouse-enabled demo at GDC saying that it was very specifically built for this GDC demo and im like sure boss
oh my god?? 
@DrMelon of steel
you're welcome :-I 
@hejgordon was at the gdc talk and was sold on it since :-I held off buying til both episodes were out
oh crap Broken Age part 2 out tomorrow!!
@floofyscorp same, can't hold my booze either. Though in my case it's I'm endangering myself by getting drunk :U
@floofyscorp best use of pubs I've found is as chillaxed drawing venues. I don't really go otherwise.
my choice of eyewear validated. 
huh. GJ @Treyarch ! 
@fixverified entirely possible, though ofc she is her own series of problems for the writer if she could do that
@fixverified he's fast she's weird tho
@fixverified I'm thinking more the reality altering stuff. Remembering an xmen comic where she mutants herself a family life reality.
I feel sorry for those without easy access to haggis dinners.
Tell the stories of a real modern war, not just a stupid movie Michael Bay highlight reel of gunfights and explosions.
Game I want to see: Call of Duty 4 with the RPG-esque story, characters, tactics and world depth of Mass Effect or Dragon Age.
@Ninchilla yeah he was in winter soldier. Cannot even remember his name.
@Ninchilla Crucial given MCU is my only exposure to this stuff. Nod wink comic insertions like the guy with wings as well.
@Ninchilla just watched it now, definitely agree, intend to ask comic fan friend s exactly wtf the vision is cos I have no idea.
Just watched Ultron, mighty spectacle movie with some genuinely funny character moments. Scarlet witch drastically underutilised tho
Lol. "The Sun Has Published Irrefutable Proof That Nicola Sturgeon Is A Monster" 
OK trip to Perth take 2
This isn't a medical emergency as I haven't eaten yet, but it does mean my afternoon walking around Perth is shot. An hour between trains.
First time ever I forgot my diabetes meds. They're in Dundee, I'm in Perth. Kicking myself for being such a fucking idiot.
Scotlaaaaand 
Also big thanks to all my IRL friends significantly lowering my expectations for the avengers movie. At least I can't be disappointed now
Trainventures to Perth! #scotlandnotaustralia
@LadyCarolMax or maybe stop condemning an entire movement based on  a few abusive tweets which we nats all condemn
"Paradox: Unionist parties have to work w those who oppose the union. To do otherwise will pronounce the union dead" 
though I notice #whomademyclothes is trending and it's a question I'd ask her. :-I
DA:O. Morrigan is my fave character so far. Ruthlessly smart, witty and attitude-tastic yet has this endearing naïveté about the wider world
@Danger_Kennedy it appears we are both trash :-I
I named my War-dog party member and I am trash. 
Sten is a cool guy 
Bad news! My shoulder injury is back with a vengeance wtf ow how did this even happen i've been sat on my ass for weeks.
Good news! Going to Perth tomorrow to catch Avengers at the IMAX!
@lizaledwards Not.

Enough.
Rico Rodriguez - Space Wizard!! Bring on the open world grapple hook mayhem and flat one-liners! 
@hejgordon @SnafuAl CoD4, BO1 were genuinely interesting though, biggest triple-A series ever can do great stuff when it puts its mind to it
@edfringe yep. this.
@hejgordon Biotech revolution, civil unrest, human augmentation, conspiracy theories, super soldiers, it's like, really guys...?
@hejgordon I liked black ops 1 but adoooore Deus Ex. Not happy with what appears to be lazy thematic copying of a braver franchise.
Call of Duty Black Ops 3 is basically Deus Ex only without the gameplay choice isn't it?
Yay! Thanks @bengal_art. :] 
Its a shame that games like gta5 do this too. Satire as lame excuse for punching down. 
UH OH. *vibrates gently* 
DA:O update. Got past the tower which totally blocked my progress first time through. Learned how to make my tanks behave themselves. #mage
Major over-elocution thing going on.
only complaint i have with DA:O atm is all the humans so far are written sounding on the extremely fancy end of Tolkien-eloquent
and sent! That was an easy vote :v
Ooh my postal ballot is here!
Accidentally queuejumped. Didn't feel too much guilt beyond whoops, sorry. I'm basically not British any more. :v

The problem is that pink is "just for girls.""


@floofyscorp oof, grisly. Will have to look up what's gone on when I get home. :/
@floofyscorp what...err...happened? Someone do a massive case of douchebag that i missed or is it more general malaise? &gt;&gt;
@caiitlinz 2spoopy4me
Just found @caiitlinz still resides in my devkit :-I 
DA:O even. I'll get around to Inquisition....eventually&gt;.&gt;
Yes, go, hit the things, mash your cooldowns, do your best DPS. I'll coordinate the whole battle from back here.
DA:I update. rolling a mage, out of the chantry and back from the kocari wilds quest in Ostagar. Oddly satisfying babysitting warrior-types.

Not sure whether I want to roll Mage/healer or Rogue. No intention of playing Warrior.
Started Dragon Age: Origins. read up a few guides, no wonder I found this hard first time, it's like an offline MMORPG.
Good. 
@Danger_Kennedy ahh yeah i remember the love scene in indigo prophecy between the female lead and literal Zombified Neo Goku Jesus wtf
@Danger_Kennedy having not played heavy rain i have no idea what that means.  :B
@EmtheLimey your profile picture is just so appropriate... :v
No watching the ending on youtube is missing the point. You lose all context, all the buildup, the dramatic crescendo of the return to earth
"Oh I haven't played it but I know the ending is bad" How about you form your own opinion?
Meanwhile people avoiding playing the mass effect games and me3 because of internet outrage are seriously missing out.
Two minutes of monologue over stock footage gimme a break. I love DXHR don't get me wrong but man that's not enough.
I am one of the people who really liked how Mass Effect 3 ended, much more closure than the ends of DXHR which no one complains about.
@hejgordon @ScotsWizzyT send a few of those cake and coffee shops down there up to Dundee and we'll talk. (Over cake)
@GoddamnMorti @floofyscorp Aw man I'm a sucker for that kinda thing. Reinstalling da:o then. :B

@jenjenjenrose maaaaaaan I wanna do this so much. Got two bare-arse walls here just begging to be arted over.
protip, keep your hands up.
I also developed this today from a gesture sketch of a boxer. kinda like how it turned out 
I fully blame @ThoughtNexus, @floofyscorp and @lizaledwards #StephenUniverse 
@lizaledwards looks great on you! Good call :D
The dubstep on placing the strawberry on the TogetherBreakfast sold me on it. :D
ok, chanced another two episodes of Steven Universe. Amethyst is the reason I watch this now :v

I used to be into cars big time. Fast Car mag, Top gear, many hours in Gran Turismo 2, then I grew up medically ineligible to drive. :v
I want a self driving car asap 
@floofyscorp Will definitely do so before christmas, just need to get myself up to date on marvel before ultron comes out :v
@floofyscorp i need to actually get around to watching them, general ambivalence plus internet outrage meant i never really bothered :L
i should probably watch the prequel star wars movies at some point, huh. not to mention a full rewatch of the original trilogy
@bengal_art I was just wondering if you had an EU option, don't fret yourself over me and thanks for responding! Keep up the great work!
@bengal_art print I ordered is currently with UPS, but I did place my order ten days before it shipped. No fault on your end though :)
@Danger_Kennedy gender politics is fun. Nowhere near enough space here to fully elucidate my brainisms on this. :v
@Danger_Kennedy I think that's bc society is well trained at demonizing women with opinions and feminists. Women be Cray is bullshit.
@Danger_Kennedy Yup! Resisting the social animal temptation to chastise people for being slightly different or not fitting an ideal :-I
@Danger_Kennedy feminism also totally central to addressing those pressures on us men imo
@Danger_Kennedy men near totally don't experience sexism. Like, at all. There are patriarchal pressures on us but thats different to sexism
#everydaysexism trending, so ofc there are dumb guys comparing societal gender inequality to them being asked to open jars and carry boxes
@bengal_art Hi Bengal! Is your art up for print sale anywhere other than inprnt? They take several weeks to even dispatch before shipping :(

Been about three years since my last Deus Ex playthrough, even then it remained my number one favourite game of all time.

That does it, after finishing DXHR I'm going to play Deus Ex again, see whether it's much-hyped 2001-era jank affects it greatness at all
IDK of any other game series that offers anywhere near the kinds of emergent tactical options as Deus Ex and I loveitloveitlooooooove it
Carried that second hacked turret from miles away, two minutes of constant enemy assault not a single shot fire by me 
@floofyscorp Aneurin Bevan is what leftists want out of labour, not some weak shit pro business blairite robot.
@floofyscorp stopped reading at "Ed Milliband is a truly great left wing leader" well maybe if he believed anything left wing at all.
@floofyscorp except in Scotland where they treat even that like a political football they hope people forget about post election.
Pub Sunday lunch! I usually avoid pubs bc i'm an antisocial dweebus but oh look this sketchbook just got filled a bunch!
Like there's a heavy diminishing return of difference once you're past 60, maybe per-frame code calculations get more accurate? IDK
I used to run Quake 3 CPMA at 125FPS and it's just not a thing which leaps out at you as "omg this amazeballs"
probably exactly the same.

#ReasonIAmNotASuperhero Supervillians are more interesting.
@AunsMundai Sounds very much like you propping them up as a shield for your movement, but whatever. That was almost civil for a minute there
@AunsMundai speak for yourself. You don't have to deal with never seeing your own gender or race or orientation represented in a game ever.
@AunsMundai So your point is "stop pushing for diversity because of one or two positive examples"? No, not even close to satisfactory.
@AunsMundai he made these comments to us at Animex in the most fire and brimstone attack of antidiversity efforts I've ever seen
@AunsMundai I am totally an SJW and agree with Levine for the most part, they're echoed by Andrew Walsh of Lionhead, also a major SJW
@AunsMundai The video is politicizing a finer character design point into an false attack on SJW desires for greater diversity
wtf autocorrect why replace GYM with GUN
@AunsMundai Levine warns against tokenism not diversity. The video is a trans parent attempt to turn Levine into a anti-diversity sockpuppet
Urggghh why does bodyweight circuit leave me feeling like I'm about to throw up :x

Not played bloodborne but having completed dark souls I can understand people's frustration being excluded from that world due to difficulty
DXHR difficulty screen Easy mode makes great point. "You play for the Story", makes me think of Bayonettas one button mode and Bloodborne.
@ChargeDog after CoD2s constant exhausting full-on total war action, it was so cool to do subtle wetwork.
We've come full circle again! 
@caraellison personally I don't, I start talking at my monitor and then get sad when game characters don't respond to my awesome puns.
@TheSquink incidentally I was at your talk at GDC this year, loved it! Way to go :)
@TheSquink hard to summarise it all with the twitter character limit but there's anger on one side over his comments regarding autism
@TheSquink Longtime Irrational Games lead, there's a lot of anger over misrepresentations of what he is saying here: 
yep, nope, stepping away from that angry twitter melting pot.
Goddamn it @twitter. I liked the discover tab. Its how I came across all kinds of cool art and stuff I'd never think to search for myself
I voted! 
@ForbesTech man, that personal suite in the back of the chairs is gonna be crap once the jerk in front leans their chair 45 degrees back

Option B: Breach room by tossing fire extinguisher in first, while he's distracted you hit him with PEPs non-lethal gun. DING Correct!
Option A: Go into room to arrest corrupt cop, have short conversation, he pulls a gun, starts firing, you knock him out.
something amazing about DX/DXHRs ability to make you go "hmm, will this unconventional tactic work? ah...ah yes it did"

@SnafuAl good chance to play the missing link DLC too

also ALL PRAXIS IMMEDIATELY GOES INTO HACKING
playing DXHR on hardest difficulty! Not doing non-lethal again, going to actually use the guns this time around, I may need them &gt;.&gt;
@DeusEx I CANNOT APPROVE OF THE MEME BUT YEAH OK.
@lizaledwards did in fact reinstall dxhr last night.....
Reminder that Market Liberalism (yay markets!) and modern Social Liberalism (Yay social justice!) are mostly two opposing concepts.
Also interesting to hear liberalism historically examined rather than current "liberal" vs conservative political dichotomy
Listening to British history lecture, grisly section on Irish famine, classical liberals welcoming purge of 'lesser' people. Horrible. :(

Listening to UC Berkely History lecture an i-t kee-s st-pping a-d miss-g w-rds my god this audio quality is cr-p
Photo: Lost my 30s pics due to power outage, carried on with the 5m and 10m #lifedrawing 
Start day with life drawing on PC, power cuts out. 

._.
hence what brought me on to that little rant about me drawing more. More ambitious, full scale drawings! less focus on style and heads.
The head is a photo study with intended stylisation, not hugely happy with it, then i did the other sketch which I am super psyched about!
I did this tonight at least: 
&lt;3 
Lunchbreaks give me a solid half-hour in coffee shops just sketching, so theres, that. Morning half hour Life drawing sessions on my pc?
truth be told I haven't done any proper drawing for the past year and a half up to a month ago when I got back from GDC. It shows.
Some of my favourite artists have tight as hell drawings coloured and rendered really loosely, I need to draw mORE
I look at art too often and wonder about how those forms were shaded, my take-away is that I practice rendering techniques over raw drawing.
Had one a moment tonight in doing art where I saw exactly how far I had to go to improve. Main issue I have is I obsess over rendering

maybe it's because I ain't got time in my life for that bullshit
@Danger_Kennedy hmmmmmmmmmmmm...it is on my steam wishliiiiist.....
@lizaledwards woah woah now let's not get hasty here, butts are a defining aesthetic for your brand
A Toffee blondie is like a chocolate brownie only they are fucking delicious and all now belong to me.

Injured my shoulder at the gyyyym :'-I
@ChargeDog mohwf sp was disjointed as shiiiit
@ChargeDog will say one thing for MoH, they based it on real events, shame it had all the subtly of a brick for anything else. :\
@ChargeDog I am a moviehipster all round :v
@ChargeDog mate :v my favourite movie is about an east german stasi spy discovering his humanity. My favourite war movie is thin red line
@ChargeDog one day we shall watch warrior king and watch a mad Thai man door breach and clear a room armed mainly with his knees
@ChargeDog I don't like those movies at all personally. :b
@ChargeDog I'm basically suggesting mw3 was a faithful retread of what mw2 did right, only now we've seen it already
@ChargeDog No I mean doing the same thing again in sequent games never dialling down spectacle for a second. Same in Bay movies
@ChargeDog Michael Bay the 2nd to 10th time around never has quite the same impact
@maradydd @abuVeliki 
@lizaledwards alpha protocol....?
@lizaledwards I was startled to notice CoD2 had women soldiers fighting alongside you in the Russian segments. Historically accurate too.

Tories played blinder nudging Telegraph to run that story. Tories keep distance, Labour dig in deep, story proves bollocks, Labour look bad
Sad thing about the false Nicola Sturgeon Telegraph story is that it will run in tomorrow's papers and facts don't matter in media.
"Don't be fooled by the minimalist graphics!" says journo who thinks people can't handle PBR shading and normal maps not being on everything

Congratulations to @caiitlinz on dinging a year and moving one step closer to being the best pokemon trainer.
@lizaledwards Paging @AmoebaLab for your input here. Where is cool in Berlin?
@lizaledwards i heard Double agent for the consoles was a totally different game and not handled by Ubi Shanghai, might be worth a look.
@lizaledwards the dual objectives idea and sneaking under people's noses thing was fan-goddamn tastic The bugs less so. :p
in short, I cannot wait until I can go airsofting again with old uni buddies. #reju2015
Also since airsofters are like 99% male, expect the same exclusionary laddish bollocks everywhere.
Mostly convinced most airsofters in the UK are UKIP or Tory voters. Equivalent to Tea Partiers and Conservatives for our American friends.

I could... get used to coffee shop lunches with a drink, sandwich and my sketchbook. &lt;3
oh i missed the leaders debate while having fun times robbing banks with friends.

what a shame...
@charltonbrooker it'd probably pick up some supporters in this country. They're just saying what only they think everyone else is thinking

First anti lgbt legislation now this. Wtf is wrong with Indiana?!
not asleep by 3am im calling this night a loss, lets do this!
@lizaledwards holy shit I think I need polypaint in my life. Hot damn thanks. :D
@lizaledwards could you explain your process here? Bake down from zbush then hand-paint texture in PS? Need to get back into 3d modelling Xo
@hejgordon vine yourself saving that really really fast #bluhblorn
@nothypemaster i want one to airsoft in.
Can't erase anything but that's A GOOD THING. &gt;:]

I went gym to do this bodyweight workout and as well as not finishing it, i now can't move. \o/ 
not listened to LP since I was like....16??
was listening to linkin park for ten minutes before I noticed i had a soundcloud page open streaming the hotline miami ost. 

sounded p good
Why the fuck are fight videos appearing all over my Discover tab? Who watches videos of people assaulting others?!
@CNMatz This is why I'm such a fan of online coop with friends. none of the competitive aspect that you need to essentially train for
@CNMatz it's more everyone has more time to play than I do, so I get regularly stomped in actual tests of ability. It's the same with CoD
Tried BF3 again for the first time in years, reminded very quickly why I don't play online shooters any more.
@floofyscorp I feel like your character's face needs to be your profile pic for some reason...
oh wait im still utterly exhausted :-I
especially being an electric bike waa waa~ :v
Bike has returned! Sixth gear is slipping a bit but fifth will do for the next six months of so i guess.

@caiitlinz best co-worker. :[
Not having a way to avoid spending half my workout waiting or reshuffling my workout put me off going for months. I am creature of routine
Honestly dudes queuing up round the block for the squat bar and bench press, can't get anything done whenever I'm at a gym.
Gonna look into bodyweight workouts. May suit my needs for Airsoft more than weights and putting up with crowded free weights areas
I don't hate multiplayer it's just not for me any more. I am not what anyone would call good at games despite my 27 years of playing them :v
For clarity I stopped playing online vs mp a few years back. I'll stick to my SP/Coop games thanks.
I am all for this as long as I can opt out and never have to play against people with way more free time than me.

@4JSteve technically and mechanically its totally solid, if the same as fc3. Just the story implications I had issue with
seriously wtf man
Farcry4s ending annoys me and feels empty as hell but at least it's not a choice to murder/spare your girlfriend like in fc3.
@dualhammers @Totalbiscuit lmao
@NolanPitler  @TheIndieSloth that cake was goddamn delicious. No worries @Danger_Kennedy, the rest of it went to a good home. *rubsbelly*
also of course it was sunny here in dundee because:

a) It's Dundee
b) our Sun still exists

i invested in proper sunglasses a while ago :D
Rip Dundee, savaged by rampaging firebenders. GJ idiots! :v
ok did everyone remember to chain down the Firebenders? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NO"?!
@SuperBlueBadger 
most of my exposure to bloodborne has been marketing art where you look at the back of some dude. :-u
That said Ubisoft Towers and thoughtless CoD gunplay and RPG grindmills can certainly feel played out looking at games right now.
Guilty Gear may feel more modern than SF2T with its layers of mechanics, but SF5 is still building off 2T. Mechanics don't age like graphics
Personally not a fan to game journos ascribing modernity to game mechanics, as if Quake's mechanics being older than CoD makes it "Old/Bad"
As problematic as MGS can be, I am still a massive fan of the series and the notion of Konami and Kojima parting ways saddens me.

If I could push a button to filter all political news crap, Tv and media and replace with cool stuff by cool people, I so would right now.
UHHH.... 
So tiiiiiiiiiirrrreeeed. #jetlag #gdcflu

Basically take the definition of fan service away from Anime creepshots and do something inclusive to all kinds of people with it
Treat characters as people with desires and wishes of their own, give their own agency, voice, touch, consent, diversity of subject
Super useful talk by @michelle_clough Fanservice need not be powerless women being paraded. Sex and sensuality in games can be so much more
God damn that talk kicked arse

Incidentally that collected art theory tutorial is incredible.


Re: Dressgate: 

Colour blindness is an entirely normal part of everyday life. 1/200 women and 1/8 men suffer from it.
Even something as simple as CoD4s attack dog which runs at the player disregarding cover AI, demands a change in tactics.
Few things scare a player and require a change in tactics like black spider headcrabs or literal teleporting One-hit-Kill Banshees.
LRT good ideas to mix up more static shooters. 

Personally I think HL2 and Mass Effect 3s enemy variety are their greatest contributions
At least the Airsoft and tohoz music recs are legit.
My youtube recommendations are like: 
- Airsoft vids 
- Touhou music 
- Endless MRA jerks - Because I +liked a Femfreq video a year ago.

@lizaledwards your dudes are revivable if they go down but if they stay down for three turns or if an enemy gets them then RIP. :c
@lizaledwards I lost one soldier through inexperience. Never. Again. Game had so many emotional high and lows purely through gameplay.

is that normal? You know the whole three choppers circling you at once thing? Bit of a step up in what is otherwise a forgiving game.
Farcry 4 just took a giant dump on me. 99% captured my first fortress, choppers start arriving, I kill them then two more show up. Repeat.

@AngelosLH I love how you can go through killing -no-one-, setting someone up for a fall to irrelevance instead. Killing feels like cheating
Nice how the indyref was generally split by class. Poorer places voted Yes, richer places voted No. Shows you who the UK really works for.
Derek Bateman on the how the UK civil service ditched all impartiality to sink Scotland's bid for Independence.  
oh for fucks sake...they weren't trailer fodder after all. 
i just had a crisp butty.

it was propa good!
@LadyDurrant Scotland being listened to for once in Britain's history? Perish the thought.
I was going to head to the gym for the first time in months today now I have my diet controlled and i get ill :C
Now as of this morning I'm within reach of 220lbs and dipping under 100kg for the first time since my teenage years.
I spent my first year in dundee trying to lose weight by exercise alone and I could *not* drop below 235lbs. A year at 235 was disheartening
@caiitlinz Have you tried typing what people are dictating to you while you look them straight in the eye, yet? Always fun. :D
@floofyscorp you sure you not got the same illness I have? :'&lt;
urgh, seems the lurgy i felt coming on yesterday is in full swing today. Spent the morning in bed with heaters on and I'm still shivering :C
@AngelosLH @philmann i know. :c plus you can bet this'll play into a Brussles Banned Page 3 Boobs tabloid shtick.
@philmann @AngelosLH But still, progress!
@philmann @AngelosLH sorry, the photos will still be of scantily clad women, there just wont be bared breasts. Baby step. :/
@jenjenjenrose HBO shows crossed over with Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
Last RT Fully grown men getting defensive on the internet at the idea that girls can beat boys at SPORTSMANS sometimes.
@tackyvillain Not yet, I thought they were trailer-fodder, but this game probably means to start as it means to go on.
I actually have far fewer problems with Wolfenstein's plot, itself an obvious power fantasy, than I do Hitman Absolution.
She instantly grows attached to 47 for no fuckin reason. "I knew you'd come back for me." No development or conflict, just fawning adoration
OK so 47 murdered Diana, who was looking after this vulnerable traumatised girl Victoria and she has no ill feelings toward this killer guy?
Oh so the devs chose to make the bads shoot up a orphanage full of nuns to show how bad they are. #HitmanAbsolution
@_BrookieB_ i refreshed the page and RTs went from 107 to nearly 300 wow
I really like Hitman games so I'd rather this kinda stuff not have to be baggage going along with my agent 47 "accident" assassination fun.
That said I think Absolution is referenced several times in @femfreq's Women As Background Decoration videos.
(cont) being raped and murdered not to mention plenty of chances to ogle them walking around naked. Nun trailer is only the beginning tbh.
(cont) while nude and in the shower no less, the girl you save is a doe-eyed naieve schoolgirl type, strip club level involves women (cont)
Enjoying Hitman Absolution but my god it has issues with women. Highest profile female character in series is Friged in the prologue (cont)
reminded me of @floofyscorp 
And its finally finished. GJ windows updates
*goes off to do laundry/cooking* 
*belly laughs* 

@DalishCassassin Have you tried asking Zack yet?
now I need to add bullets with faked trajectory, target impacts, simulate recoil + reset and random aiming muscle twitch movement.
in other news, I'd doing a very simple gamemaker target shooting game, I've found a good way to make my 2d gun-sight graphic follow my mouse
also why I go out of my way to never be the Entitled Customer Asshole who complains and disparages part time minimum wage workers.
Last RT: having spent several years on £4k a year working a shit job, I can totally relate. I will always value that perspective gained.
Just got my hair cut by Hard Grind in Dundee, place owns. Do recommend!
Not sure if cold neck is due to a draft or super close sandpaper-feeling haircut.
Boop be doop havent had breakfast yet ;-; #weekends
Tweets while waiting for a haircut
@initials_games just a suggestion but maybe the sprite itself is too big? Very long tail and only a short body. Cool look regardless tho! :v
love that there's a women's guide too which is the EXACT SAME advice. No mystical product-driven myth bullshit. Eat Less, Exercise more.
I love the SA weight loss guides, they dispel so much horseshit and repeat and reinforce

"Calories in &lt; Calories Expended = Weight Loss".
YES! Dropped a stone in weight (14lb) since October! IT'S WORKINNNNG
Was going to give Sonic Generations a go but it won't even start on my pc. I will not stress trying to fix a sonic game bye *uninstalls*
Congratulations to @GabrielleKent  for making the Top 100 Women in Games list! 
@PetiteMistress just as bad is the Moral Choice of killing a big bad or not after eviscerating hundreds of underlings w/o a second thought
Like that more old uni lady-friends I know are voicing feminist views over social media even if they won't openly identify as feminist
@LewieP more disbelief on my end that such people exist as I have never met anyone identifying as such. Yeah they should probably stop.
@LewieP I've most often heard the phrase used by people to have a go at PC gamers, hence my initial question.
@LewieP PC Master Race?
@LewieP is this a thing? This author may well be the first to take the phrase non-ironically. Il be over here carrying on enjoying games.
@_omocat GaoGaiGar.txt
@tackyvillain You should go to japan as you may well find your people (and a shitload of kamen rider merch *cough* )
@tackyvillain that fucking pear thing was all over japan and I hadn't the slightest clue what it was and no one could really tell me.
@tackyvillain reading this on a mozzarella meato G #pizzatweets
@ElizSimins HI FROM SCOTLAND! :D
"Survey: 45% of the UK industry's women feel gender is a "barrier"."

"This ain't snow, but the breaking of seals. The undoing of weather itself.” 

-BJ Blazkowicz on first trip to Scotland.
*looks at snow outside*

hello there magnums my old friend, I've come to put you on again.

*dons boots*
@IrradiatedCat shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!
@ChargeDog indeed. such as a TM MP7. 
@tackyvillain Cannon Lesbian.
downloading sonic generations so i can play something a little less grim. :B
You get a rambo achievement for killing more than 220 in a single heist with an LMG. We still had three more bags to cook :v
I am a nonviolent guy but in #Payday2, Rats, day one, Cooked seven bags of meth, Overkill Pro = bodycount of 325 dudes. Daaamn.
@DrMelon Just sayin', might wanna hold your tongue. 
attempt to find img meme where i can pretend i "be all up in da club like"

does not. 
being a ginger on #kissagingerday 
@tackyvillain idk any good comment sections.  
Instead of following tut perfectly ive added gravity, friction and now im making bouncy clownball game a sort of kickup game.
Just did some late gamemaker revision of tutorial content without the tutorial to guide me through the code. Learning!!
god damn it wolfenstein that was some weak payoff ending.
Dropping my calorie goals from 2000 to 1760. Current weight loss so far is 11lb since November. I can do this!
God, that was a bit of good news I could do with. Fucking good job #AGDQ2015. You guys own.
doesn't help when the autoshotty supersoldat guys can kill you with a look if you happen to be unfortunate enough to have not grabbed armour
oh my GOD wolfenstein enemies get terrifically bullet-spongey later on. Hi, you want to kill this guy? Empty half your weapons into him.
was going to try get work done today but I'm exhausted and can't really focus on stuff. Constant stream of shitty world news ain't helpin
Last RT is goddamn hilarious. Go look at it while I cackle at the subtle deviousness.
also this: 
Back! My bike lives again however the ride back was pretty cold and wet and I forgot my gloves so my fingers aren't quite working yet
Just witnessed barista lady kick open the back room door in costa and now my brain is action baristas. Hell yeah
@AngelosLH I found your game: 

The control-Z for when you destroy the board as well :v
Off to pick up my bike from repairs. damn thing was poorly sick as hell from me not knowing basic bike maintenance :B
How does Ash from Evil Dead load his shotgun with one hand? Same as videogame dual-wielders, I guess, the magic of off-screen.
much as i like wolfenstein atm its foreshadowing may as well be 3 mile high neon letters on the moon. Insanely good production values tho
@tackyvillain 
@tackyvillain 

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
@tackyvillain now my amazon suggested products based on what I've looked up is airsoft crap, PC parts and now animu figurines!!!
@tackyvillain this gave me the idea of getting a touhou nendoroid off amazon that i couldn't find while I was in japan WHAT HAVE YOU DONE :C
Wolfenstein is really good. It has so much calm scene-setting downtime to contrast it's loud moments.
so remember i said i pigged out earlier today on pizza and missed my calorie target? I'm actually 47kCal under my 2000 target :v #nailedit
clearly my mistake with the sudden snow was venturing outside, lesson learned!

*spirals out into space*
In taxi now and apparently swirling hateblizzard was local mainly to kingsway west, theres nothing in town centre wtf
People being blown off their feet outside tescos
That said it is easing up really quick, I was stuck outside at kingsway in something torrential for a moment there
IT IS SNOWING WITH A VENGEANCE HERE IN DUNDEE HOLY SHIT
In pizza hut, just calorie-checked my order and phoned today in as an off day for my diet. :S back on the horse tmo!
Ooooff #rekt


.@caiitlinz 
Greens would be my choice if I was in England, because goddamn...everyone else....

Thankfully in scotland atm, so I'm voting SNP.
Sounds like he wants more parties in the debates to add more voices against UKIP.
Cameron threatening to drop out of TV debates unless Green party are included. I despise him, but Green inclusion is needed
@Novorossiyan And the LGBTQ people in Russia? What of them?
@AngelosLH In russia's case too the orthodox christian chruch is huuuuuge and  well tied w government.
@AngelosLH in bad economic times facist governments (like the UK) demonise underclasses and minorities to preserve their own control.
@AngelosLH Russia is economically hitting the skids, esp with US/OPEC pressure on oil prices and US embargoes due to Ukraine.
@tackyvillain sticking to your style, draw kids and way older people, also buff macho dudes. Push dat comfort zone :D
@floofyscorp oh my god that tongue :'D
@etomame Capitalism
@floofyscorp @caiitlinz Missed opportunity for more Dundee-characteristic Pie dispenser though. Breakfast Pies particularly
So #Japan may be world leaders in the use of vending machines, meanwhile in dundee, potatoes. :v 
@AngelosLH Disgusting show made for disgusting people to get angry at.
@AngelosLH Saw a C4 show about obese people on benefits trending and the tweets in response are some of the most vile.
Still, pushing the difficulty up a notch or two is pushing me into a conservative, considered style of play which I tend to enjoy anyway.
Wolfenstein has Terrence Malick-style hushed monologues and their use here offends me. This is not the Thin Red Line.
Been convinced to give Wolfenstein another go. It's warming on me, but my word if it isn't laid on overdramatic
Sonic 3 and Knuckles in 38.18 Daaaaamn. #AGDQ2015
sky sanctuary is where s3&amp;K gets REAL
they're at hidden palace already wow :O
@tackyvillain miles hax prower
oh crap flying battery coming uuuuup! #agdq2015
MY JAM
@tackyvillain Derp, Starlight Zone. Starry night was megamix
@tackyvillain it definitely started in 2, though sonic 1 had a really pretty level called starry night.
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
TAILS IS FIGHTING THE WRONG BOSS
*skips entire level*
flyin around at the speed of GEDDAN
GOTTA GO FAST #sonic3andknuckles #AGDQ2015

LETS A GOOOO
I don't remember dirk vs mastodon in sonic
@tackyvillain CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW THIS BLEW MY 13-YO BRAIN?!
CHECK DAT S3&amp;K MUSIC
uh oh. Greatest Sonic Game ever now on #AGDQ2015.

Sonic 3 and Knuckles. GREATEST. BEST. SONIC GAME.
#AGDQ2015 they're on sonic 2 right now and this is KILLING MY CHILDHOOD.
@tackyvillain OH WAIT YEAH "SPEED" RUN THEY'RE ALREADY ON IT
@tackyvillain flmao i forgot about sky chase

sky fortress is next tho :v
@lizaledwards @floofyscorp WHY
@tackyvillain Can't remember anything abt xxxholic except Bad Things Happen To Non-Gothic types was a really common plot
(barely functioning)
More gamemaker progress! Passed second tutorial and made a functioning 1942 clone
Doing gamemaker stuff and my tunes be all THIS RIGHT NOW 
bounces in anticipation of newest airsoft delivery
@lucyrawrs I know right? You must just love my charming witticisms! You'll be back :v
@lucyrawrs BYE THEN :v
@Terrorbuns @tackyvillain systemic racism with convenient capitalist "asians don't sell" self-reinforcing non-proofs fuck hollywood forever.
reminder Scarlet Johannsen playing an Asian character in GitS that Hollywood still has a problem with non-white leads

@broderick some producer bod likely nuked the idea of asian cast lead way early into production, because they don't sell or something.
@DrMelon @tackyvillain that said i just noticed sonic generations remixes of older S2 and S3 songs and whoops i just bought it on steam :-I
@DrMelon @tackyvillain Right?? Sonic 2 and 3 had some of the best 16-bit music of the entire generation. It's just so consistently good.
@DrMelon @tackyvillain *kicks down door* *flips table* *one hand slam dunks Flying Battery, smashing the backboard* 
SO happy Guilty Gear Xrd won best looking game. They wanted a look they did mental levels of tech trickery to get it, it looks goddam great.
Going through @giantbomb 's game of the year podcasts
Thanks so much @OVERKILL_TM !!! 
Hotline miami ost + long queues = bad idea?
@lizaledwards @AngelosLH Blender simply is. :-I
"calm down it isn't real"
"there are bigger issues we should be worrying about" 
in other news, looking forward to the first day back at work tmo! Been a great christmas with family, now im ready to get back to it.
Another new years resolution, avoid racism-driven English politics.
£680s worth of new pc sat there on my amazon basket...

a let me sleep on it
baby baby let me sleep on it
Il give u an answer in the mornin
@floofyscorp @Super_Widget Same, so wish i did trad art, gives you that art grounding, resources for 3d are online or in help files now.
@carolynmichelle great video. so reminded of the concept of living ironically. 
Today is exactly a day i wish i already had my new sunglasses. Squinting in Dundes
@DrMelon @tackyvillain She could have been so much more if they played the horror angle or developed her rather than have a big final battle
@DrMelon @tackyvillain Sadly BM had an intimidating design and character that wasnt allowed to flourish beyond being a scary end boss
@DrMelon @tackyvillain He's a noir pastiche with a side of overpowered "not even my final form" going on, but his performance I liked.
@tackyvillain Yep. Sorry.
@tackyvillain I enjoyed Bigby more. She started strong and actually threatening but she's just a baddie to beat, not fleshed out.
Eta til frat guy shoves girl into bunch of bushes or heckles a TED talker with SHOW US YOUR TITS because thats what we expect of comedy now
Just saw Dumb and Dumber Too. Mediocre, telegraphed humour, same jokes as the first film, poor pranks that idiots will unironically copy
D: 
Enough bacon, time for glasgow transport museum
Breakfast tweets the likes of which most tweeters i know are too busy being asleep.
Bacons more like BAC-OWNS
Bacon Beacons, better than that place in wales
Bacon Bad. That breakfast people wont stop praising
harvester breakfast bacon levels rising
Having to interject with "She" a bunch of times when relatives talking about tv news story with the transgender woman. Slow progress.
Another day exploring glasgow ahead, sadly my legs Arent Working. :s
Spent today trotting around glasgow, had beer, had pizza, utterly knackered
Occasionally see fb pics of old uni buddies still in boro having fun while I had the audacity to leave and pursue a career. :s
@tackyvillain Same reason Im so crazy for Heat. Ace slow-burning character-driven movie with the greatest gunfight ever at the dramatic peak
Floods in fields at sides of the motorway, accident on mw outside glasgow, HOWAY
Money lights on fire any time it approaches my wallet also i renewed my UKARA so that TM XDM I've been eyeing up just got bought. &lt;3
Mother tried to tell my brother off for exuberant spending and that he should be careful with money like me im like err im an airsofter.....
Up early tmo for a few days in Glasgow! Gonna visit the Transport and Science museums, shop and eat at the bier hall. Suggestions welcome!
Dodgy robot bastid had exactly the same straight hand as me
May have just audibly said SON OF A BITCH, CLAPTRAP in front of my nephews. Poker night at the inventory 2 can get heated
Also please ensure you've actually seen the Back To The Future movies before we hit October. Then watch Flight of the Navigator as well!
@kylerodgers Confirmed for camel.
Window open, heating on, parent cooking downstairs, here I lie in bed neither truly hot or truly cold. 

Yep
@tackyvillain Not recommended! Avoid if possible.
@tackyvillain its fuckin bullshit you spend any time as an adult and you start going shit im not 18 any more why am i falling apart
@gameinformer No more reboots/remakes/rehashes please. NEW GAMES.
@tackyvillain 30s to Middle age is where you begin to appreciate the value of status effects and defeating via hopelessness. :v
Whiskey out in the front yard with my Dad, watching the Tameside sky make out like an air raid sans sirens.
Happy New Year and may 2015 bring love, life and happiness to all of you!
Queen is on bbc1 8I 

HOLD ME
New Years Resolutions.

Lose 2st.
Do more art/games work in my own time. 
Find a new place to live.
Travel more!
Sorry twitter, couldnt really stomach more than 15 minutes of charlie brookers 2014 wipe. Rather not think of farage and co
@tackyvillain Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
My 4-5yo nephews are now enjoying @stampylongnose videos. Ive literally never seen them so quiet. :D
@torpordust gj reddit
Can't help notice people being negative jerks about new years resolutions. Sorry you lacked the resolve to follow through on yours i guess?
It helps that it meaty and satisyfying to use too
Its not realistic since SPAS12 has only one barrel but fuckit, it gives you the DooM 2 Super Shotgun at a button press. Gameplay trumps all.
Forgot to mention. HL2 has the greatest videogame shotgun ever. Long range, tightish spread, "both barrels" secondary fire for panic moments
@AngelosLH No horses in Max. 1:0 to Minecraft. :v
@DrMelon the designers are so damn good at leading you toward solutions and toward traps
Disregard her of initials KH. She wants your anger, her career relies on it. Deprive her of publicity, don't stoop to her level.
Everything from variable pacing, the best enemy variety in any game I've seen, well thought out weapons, makes mockery of many big sellers
Aw man. Finished replaying hl2 series. Game designers should play and replay that as it is a masterclass in good design
@tackyvillain Get welsh
Spec Ops The Line £4 on Steam. Will not stop being relevant as long as we have uncritical, lazy, yearly CoDs and BFs
@DrMelon Welcome to being old. :v
@AngelosLH God yeah, blender is infuriating. maya, max, xsi and cinema4d are all reasonably easy to switch between but blender...christ
Valkyria Chronicles remains my GOTY 2014.
@floofyscorp "I don't hate this..."
@ChargeDog I put about an hour and a bit into it and it didnt grab me at all. What am i missing?
showed my dad how to ask google on his phone and now he's been using the voice search for two hours
So today I made my first game! A Bouncy Clownball tutorial project in gamemaker.
@tackyvillain In an age of spiralling budgets. A style choice is often for highly practical reasons
@tackyvillain I take issue with the accusation of indies choosing pixel art for popularity reasons because its a low cost entry point&gt;
@tackyvillain This is two separate issues though. Indies choosing pixel art and objecting to 2d techniques which came from the 32bit age
Meanwhile Discovery and Nat Geo are far too obsessed with cars, guns and How Its Made rather than nature and culture documentaries
It reminds me of BBC of old before it felt like it needed to do shitty dance competitions and compete in the race to the bottom
Nhkworld channel still providing more wondrous cultural exposure than any other channel on sky tv. Japanese TV special on towns in the Alps.
Grumpy this morning. IDEK why. Muscles still bit achy from airsoft and yesterday shopping for six hours was knackering i guess
@tackyvillain Don't beat on indies using a visual style in a way you don't like. Pixel art is so much more than NES 16 colour.
Polarised lenses for life shame they make phone screens unreadable. :I
Agonised far too long over buying a set of good oakley sunglasses. Bloody need them in dundee i mean SUNDEE
@tackyvillain Whats borderlands then? :v
HL2: Super Grav Gun aka the only game where you can literally beat a motherfucker with another motherfucker
Sheer blind panic
After that, a plank of wood is blocking an item stash, so you break the wood and like EIGHT BLACK HEADCRABS drop from the ceiling. Panic.
Single black headcrab waiting round a corner, you'd been killing those for a while so you are cautious of them. Super dangerous.
Brilliantly smart use of enemy spawn triggers and even physics puzzles to create traps and memorable moments.
One thing I adore about hl2 is insanely good level design.
Goddamn i dislike Quentin Tarantino movies.
I seem to have a polar opposite taste in movies as my dad. Like damn near 100% of the time
@tackyvillain Emoji fart. #letitgo
@CharlieSutton12 @NotFaulty @SuperSpacedad Our economy is fine thank you.
Definitely think theres something to what people are saying about scheduled broadcasting being a dying medium.
Actually fuckit. I get ragey at tv in general. *turns off*
Hate news networks that always point out how many britons were involved in XYZ  disaster, as if the other 200 people don't matter. #skynews
@plasmatron Naked contempt for the Scots, what happened to #bettertogether ?
When playing games i tend to notice good and bad game design more than art. Hmm... This bears inquiry.
Reflecting a little on my difficulty focusing on art study. I am wondering if my passion lies more towards games than the art of games.
Going to Halo Mill airsoft for a few hours. Gonna drop some dudes with Brother Captain. :v
@caiitlinz @4J_ChrisReeves 
@AngelosLH I very gladly avoid watching tv nowadays. For anything i want to see theres netflix and the internet.
Saw this and reminded of @caiitlinz 
In run up to 4j poker tournament i taught myself to play using poker apps. Now tourney is done im playing poker night at the inventory. :I
@caiitlinz @floofyscorp Fb messager app has the face icon act like a anowglobe whenever you move it
@tackyvillain toph owns hard tho. Fair cop. :v
@SnafuAl And a BROKE DICK PIECE OF SHIT DRILL to you too motherfucker!
@tackyvillain Thats basically me if i had dark hair, dont judge. :v
Merry Christmas you beautiful bastards!
@floofyscorp HULK PRETTY
This is why unlike the rest of my family, i got them lego :v
I bet you they will lose the usb leads, the remotes and smash the toys to bits before the week is out
These things come with training manuals and USB companion apps. The actual fuck iust happenned to dino toys?!
Zoomer dino toys for my nephews, currently testing these AI noisebastards. I will be far from the nephews once they start playing with these
@tackyvillain dont encourage him! &gt;:c
Enough grump, time for muppets christmas
Actually any time i come back here it feels like timewarping back ten years. Say the word Netflix and you'll be looked at like a weirdo
It feels like a place that hasnt changed since the early 90s and has all the most generic high street shops
Stockport is the most depressing town in greater manchester my god
Phone music is my savior
My dad keeps playing Gunfight At The OK Corral on the car mp3 player and its driving me utterly spare
@floofyscorp I am approving majorly of dogtweets.
This pc keeling over at mere suggestion of graphics so ho hum im installing hotline miami
My 4 yo nephew just punched a baby mooshroom into a lava flow then giggled. #minecraft #wasithisbad?
@tackyvillain The real dark souls itt. Granmode
Parents dragging me shopping in stockport in the morning. Christmas eve in shiteiest town in the north west lord help meh
Smug as fock 
Extra credits once did a video about emergent comedy in games, im pretty sure Goat Simulator was the result!
beyond Good And Evil runs like buggy shit whyyyyyy
@Jewelots_ gard gard gagagagard *vuvuzelas*
This PC still can't run Valkyria Chronicles WEHH
Wondered why games were running bad on this machine. Gfx driver version 2.2, current version 3.4something. :-×
@tackyvillain 
Do old people just not need sleep or something? Anytime I'm down here its Get up its 7am we've got stuff to do and I'm URRRGHHHHH
@4J_ChrisReeves I consider it reward for fixing their PC so often :v
@AngelosLH *googles* oh my god Bill Murray also OH MY GOD it cane out in 1988 *dies of age*
@AngelosLH I thought it was typical Scrooge don't be a selfish capitalist asshole thing, been a while since I watched it tho
RIP parents internet *downloads a shitload of steam games*
Going to plug into the internet. Missing the choice to do/watch w/e I like
Golfdad watching Father-Son DadGolf. #dadtweets #tv 
Golf makes for staggeringly boring tv
Arrive back at parents place and what's on TV but Mrs brewns boys :-I
@philcsf @floofyscorp I'm sure GTA will do fine.
This is a long way of saying good lord Korra is dense and naïve
And as easily manipulated by people who aren't parents or guardians too.
Started Korra s2. Its quite impressive how much Korra is a teenager. Impulsive, rebellious, confused. Rare for a show to get that right
@AngelosLH Roll with it!
I will go back to japan someday.
Young japanese people braving the rainstorm all in traditional dress and here's this ginger guy in a flag grinning like an idiot :v
Sudden random memory of watching fireworks over Tokyo river in the rain with broken umbrella and saltire flag over my shoulders. Hell yeah
@ChargeDog you should play sleeping dogs
Its finally hit me. Im excited to be heading to parents place for Christmas. :D
heartbreaking to see two murdered policemen being used by real people to attack a movement against systemic racism. #BlackLivesMatter
oh christ even more korra spoilers all over my discover tab.
Lmao shadow warrior just did the cake or death joke. Eddie izzard fans on that team
I am staggered by how CoD is the only series you can charge £30+ for on steam several years after an iteration's release.
majority of stuff packed but need to wait for clothes to dry to finish packing OHWAITVIDEOGAMES!
@tackyvillain YOU GOT THIS LETS FUCKEN GO~
@floofyscorp DOG! *points* :D
@gameinformer nope. episodes a week apart I can stand, not months. I wait until the last ep is out before I run it.
finally changed my goddamn sa username. only had that last one for a decade now &gt;.&gt;
*Nods sagely*

#shadowwarrior 
also booked my hotel and shit for animex &gt; . &gt; #grownupstuff
just booked my first ever first class train tickets, for february time so they're cheaper now on select trains than coach closer the time.
@tackyvillain howay!


@tackyvillain about 8-10 other twitter accounts on my discover feed also going mental, so ne worries, means i need to suffer S2 sooner
@cheekylatte and Scotland suffers under English (sorry "British") management of Scotland.
@cheekylatte Salmond is saying the English should have a say in how our country is run which we should. We don't run things at all right now
@tackyvillain i am happy to hear this but also mad sad abt spoilers :c
@PeterKGeoghegan @libby_brooks Guardian's chosen favourite in Scotland then?

@tackyvillain incidentally, I wish someone made clear to me that any weapon is legit for endgame play. Pick favourite and upgrade it!
@tackyvillain @4J_ChrisReeves tbf the hammer you get is unusable for a fair while and doesn't suit most play styles. :B
@tackyvillain In fact you get a reward for doing so
@tackyvillain You can totally beat the asylum demon on his first appearance, not even joking. :v

@femfreq @ElizSimins @Fangamer Nothing but love for the Feminist Gamer Illuminati. &lt;3
So basically Obama leaning on OPEC to punish Russia with low oil prices means Scotland can't be self-sufficient or independent? Bullshit.
@tackyvillain Welcome Sunsister. *praises the sun*
@tackyvillain @beccenstein_ Adventures of Stampycat and friends - A Lovely Telltale games adventure.
@caiitlinz No its too cold I'm sunning myself up in Manchester :----I
have a cake stand!~ &gt;A&lt; 

@floofyscorp clover is fucking awesome. 
@floofyscorp like bam outta nowhere. "Christ she's ugly" im like uhh dude, you judge the guys on their looks that harsh-like?
or maybe we can stop reducing female characters to the sum of their looks.
no apparent need to comment on anyone else's looks, especially the guy with greasy ponytail and burn marks on his face.
so apparently one friend I play payday with felt necessary to condemn the first female heister added as ugly.
@dannyodwyer on the upside at least, she's non-sexualised, has entertaining dialogue and is just as much of an arsehole as the guys. :v
@Its_The_Dom @dannyodwyer Hoxton is unhinged, violent, calls people Y'wanker a lot so I feel he's a good rep for my fellow Englishmen

Community requests NPCs based on people they hate: ht…
@floofyscorp so apparently Rebellion are hiring entry art positions may be worth an application in case they have something more your level?
but then Im expecting to have every relative this christmas demand to know whether I "voted to save the union" so this discourse is standard
SA scotpol thread is poison and it's the fault of one guy spending all day every day on the forums being a snippy dishonest arsehole.
Especially cos Clover kind of owns :v
Also really good to see @OVERKILL_TM responding to the call for more playable female characters in games. I hope they add more women.
so Diamond Heist for #Payday2 launched and my killcount was nearly my other three teammates combined. #scarednow 
i am laugh
Lol, Hatred has been pulled from Steam Greenlight. 
 
@floofyscorp waaait a minute uartsy was where i got my max-to-maya vids :D
@floofyscorp Ace thanks! if i have to watch any more bad non-game-art-relevamt tuts bloviating on the wonders of 2.5D pixols imma scream. :c
paging @floofyscorp for zbrush resources now I've sorta got the hang of maya. Maybe I'll finally get past this difficulty hump with zbrush?
@tackyvillain Just-World hypothesis is so fucking full of shit. "Oh you've had a bad time in your life must have been your own fault" *smug*
@mstewart_23 utter pish from the champagne liberals at the guardian as always.
Alas, BFs visuals are more a Frostbite engine showcase now, it's a shame that a more easily readable art style is not a priority for Dice
typo, meant arma 3, but still!
Camoflage can be a legit strategy, as shown in ARMA2, but it also way slows your game down to a waiting game.
This is why BF games require spotting systems now to allow fast paced BF gameplay in a game where camoflage is easy due to pure visual noise
The rush for TRIPLE A DETAIL and fancy lighting simply made players harder and harder to actually see. Graphics totally impact gameplay.
As a fan of BF2, I always thought later games lost the clear silhouettes and simpler art that didn't obscure players 
fucking *great*.

my front bike tire is flat now.
i have meat croquettes cooking

meat

croquettes. *drools*
@DrMelon @tackyvillain i don't really have a beef with that one :v
Myfitnesspal is a fantastic application of mobile technology the tech hipster says sat in Costa being terrifically full of caramel Yule log
There's def something to be said for gamification and its benefits to diet and diabetes control. Logging all my food has been a great change
@tackyvillain sounds like a great name for my pe-*vanishes out of existence by the sheer will of the universe*
Fuck. Sake. Angry now. Would rather not have remembered that time of my life.
Having nearly gone through a tribunal to get two months wages I was once owed, £1200 up-front fee is fucking monstrous.
Which is shit and terrible because it means employers can be greater arseholes to their employees without as much fear of legal response.
Had to leave a job due to harassment or wrongly dismissed/owed salary? In the UK you now need to pay for Tribunals 
Not much willingness to do much of anything today. :v Gotta go shopping but urrghghgh
@floofyscorp :/
Playing Shadow Warrior, gruesome, corny, silly-and-it-knows-it and yet staggeringly pretty. 
mm! damn, red bean mochi is delicious but my god I can't make room in my diet for it :v
MUSIC TIME! I have this on goddamn loop right now. #reverseideology #seijakijin


I always get wobbly tables whenever I eat out. :I
Cackling at this coincidental pair of tweets on my TL :v 
ahahaha Jim Murphy is Scottish Labour leader. Milliband will be handing you your instructions shortly. #eggscellent
@tackyvillain true, but like a lot of things, it's possible to do well, very easy to do badly :L 
@tackyvillain Shaved and drawn on eyebrows looks comically bad to me too, but surprised at how many of these articles there are.
@tackyvillain men's negative opinion on lady fashion is mostly oppression and control but really long fingernails gross me the fuck out
I just watched a VC youtube vid of someone 1-turning a Hard level skirmish I've been trying to beat all night. I am disgusted. Alicia is OP
It's not clear whether my strategy is wrong or what, when character levels are a factor. Game could easily do without RPG levelling.
Flank harder? Synchronise Strategy? Cover movements? Tactics? No this would be doable if you grinded and your dudes stat numbers were higher
Valkyria Chronicles issue im having at the moment is that RPG levelling means I can be totally underlevelled/geared for a Strategy fight
Always wanted to go but I was always either too poor, too busy at work or a student at Teesside therefore both of the above. :v
Holidays and tickets booked! Sweet! I'm going to be at @AnimexFestival this year!
wayne's world movie was 22 years ago.

my god

Likely some unscrupulous producer asshole is about to remake it.
Huhh, so it seems lower calorie food is easier to find the more upmarket a store you go. Meanwhile icelands tescos and such is devoid of it
Irish lady heister character confirmed for payday 2. She's not Scottish any more but eh, I'll deal. 
Not hype for spiderman movies atm bc I know they'll be rebooted anyway but would totally be down for Marvel movies at the helm. Crossovers!
@caiitlinz #yolo
@caiitlinz D: why
I challenge you to find better game music from 1995. :v #MarvelSuperHeroes #Cap 
erm so im playing valkyria chronicles again. so many Hard and Expert-level skirmishes, story DLC, SO MUCH CONTENT. &lt;3
that tex mex chicken was thoroughly underwhelming and the juice made all the nacho bits damp. sad :(
@SquidGaming i am in literal pain right now I am groaning so hard. GOOD JOB.
back on the horse tomorrow though!
WELP! First time in 26 days I've gone over my calorie target! Sorry guys this Chicken, Cheese with Nacho bake needs eating today.
Reminder to progressive allies, amplify other peoples voices, dont shout over them lest you marginalise them yourself

oh my god uninstalling that gave me back soo much hard drive spaaace!
played about an hour of Wolfenstein the New Order. Not my kinda game. Combat feels super clunky.
lordy christ december is expensive ;-;

presents, £100 train tickets, more presents, watching my bank balance and im all wehhhh
Dear @YouTube. I watch Anita Sarkeesian videos. Please stop recommending Thunderf00t and other hate-filled "debunk" material, thank you.
no dissing naughty dog though, those guys can make a game, holy shit. The Last Of Us remains immense.
last RT made me laugh given how many Nathan Drake Really Doesn't Want An Uncharted 5 pics there have been through all the marketing for U4
@floofyscorp booking it to BHS after work. gonna grandpa it up. :v
WTB blanket. There's a draft under my desk and my legs are freezing
@tackyvillain charge more &gt;:c
Once past the early game, every victory felt like a massive triumph I had earned. Just wish Welkin's tank dying wasn't insta-fail.
That said, any set piece battle involving Maximillian or Selvaria had me gnashing in frustration, but still coming back for more.
It does one thing I especially like. Every battle is hand-crafted by designers, so you don't luck out with procedural generation.
Man. Finished Valkyria Chronicles. Anime cliche story but the actual battle system plus cool characters make it memorable. Great game.
Also ITS COLD YO
Urgh cycled to tesco again and the oncoming wind knackered me out even with electric assist. :c
@theStarduster Exactly, blind pride does no one any good. Public sector spending cuts eviscerated Boro, WM is at fault here.
Also reminded of the "Managed Decline" of Liverpool that was proposed (and possibly enacted) during Thatcher's time.
who knew someone might think a town wracked by austerity is a bit rubbish? (I spent 7 years there fwiw)
article by an ex-local complaining about Middlesbrough is doing the rounds on my fb again. People getting wildly defensive abt their town.

@jenjenjenrose no hes mine &gt;:c
I kinda feel bad for the guys getting their heads mangled and backs broken :v
think im getting old, just watched a clip of Yakuza 4 fights and grimaced at some of the mangled faces the lead guy leaves on mob types
also now my discover tab is full of non sequitur tweets from the game awards. :-I
Few things drive me to apoplexy than burning food I'm looking forward to. #ripburntpizza
Pictured in Tesco, Dundee, #Scotland. Because we are literally exactly the same as America, right? 
Security risk my giant white arse. :I
At station, need toilet but can't leave bike in case station cops wirecut my bike lock again.
Grumble, missed one every hour train to Perth. munching panini in tesco Costa.
@Ninchilla I tend to be an optimist WRT people too, but afaik they have work to do to gain back respect from people like me.
@Ninchilla After dickwolves I wouldn't have given them the benefit of the doubt.
@floofyscorp no words for how fucking dumb and kneejerky I find that comic. Jack Johnson is not coming to ban your videogames guys ffs
No, Penny Arcade. No.
@tackyvillain @DrMelon how did you even survive at 4j? :-I
@ChargeDog 
@ChargeDog tried it last night, gun owns :v come shoot ze polices, michael charge. #pd2
@ChargeDog HEY CHARGE COME PLAY VIDEOGAMES
@DrMelon @tackyvillain set three alarms. or just mainline coffee
Grown adult I've known for years still in 2014 using "Gay" as a lazy pejorative. For fucks sake man knock it off
I love how every article about Deus Ex Universe leads with NO IT'S NOT AN MMO, RELAX.

Good, because an MMO would be the death of DX
@floofyscorp vine account, go
@floofyscorp you need a video camera or a head mounted go pro for times like this.
BUT, I probably won't keep buying it.
Finally got a copy of #thenational. I support an independent Scotland and see this paper as a necessary response to London media domination
@caiitlinz Drink.
a story you don't hear often, post-apoc games oft assume everyone is selfish. Nice to hear that may not be true in even in the worst times.
The best thing to come from #thiswarofmine is the tales of bonding and support from Sarajevo seige survivors, rather than selfish anarchy.
@JeanetteLeech Future PM, depressingly.
Jesus, now the cop who strangled #EricGarner won't even be indicted. American justice protecting their own at the expense of black lives.
@FreakyZoid Modellers have been doing AN94s, AEK971s and AK12s as AKM standins for some time now. :I

oof! #nailedit 
Going to Bed early tonight! By which I mean I am going to lie down wide awake til 3am when I finally get tired. :I
huh. how about that? :I
so i just came across a youtube anime by a japanese studio commissioned by the Israeli tourism board to attract japanese tourism to Israel.
In America, if you're black, just walking with your hands in your pocket gets you stopped 
I need gaming podcasts that aren't games press guys talking to games press guys about games press. Particular trend as of late.
@tackyvillain Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!
@tackyvillain learning maya almost all of the tutorials I've been using has been text-based help files. Very easy to navigate/reference
@tackyvillain depends what you want from it i guess. overarching conceptual introduction or intensive info dump/reference
@tackyvillain zeroing in on the bit of info you actually want in 3d tut videos is so much more annoying than in a written one.
@tackyvillain the day the internet rediscovers written tutorials for 3d shit will be a glorious day indeed.

if this were just a food on it's own i wouldn't care but no it's supposed to be a lean meal. Lean like a goddamn entire pizza, sure!
just seen "healthy" recipe for a philadelphia cheese steak and pepper wrap. Nearly 500KCal PER WRAP omfg wtf is wrong with you.
@ronmarz I'd rather justice and an unravelling of hundreds of years of systemic racial prejudice. Media picking this pic up too is telling.

Glasgow has loads of urban murals going on. Almost as many as I remember seeing in central Los Angeles 
Wanted to see George Square but every in of it is covered with rides, ice rink and Christmas stuff 
Nice day out dodging traffic and occasional shopping in glasgow. 
@4J_ChrisReeves its OK though I had a spare lock. But still. Just for chaining to a gate while i went to the toilet and not a bike stand?
Sweet! Glasgow station staff know how to give a warm welcome. They bolt cuttered my bike lock and nearly took my bike away. :I
HOWAY THE GLASGOW
That feel when you have a seat on a train jam packed with people and your bike is taking up standing room :v
heading to glasgow tomorrow to explore. Disregard the ginger gent on the magic nonpedalling bicycle.
2 weeks, 6lbs lost. doing good :D
@tackyvillain mac lyfe <KISS MARK>
hope tales from the borderlands can be enjoyed without having gone through the previous games.
I mean Walking Dead had no character links to the show only the setting so I could still enjoy it without having connection to the tv series
nothing against the GoT crowd as I've not seen the show, but the TT game being super tied to said show nuked my interest in it :c
new star wars i am hype. gimme.
@floofyscorp lightsaber claymore lightsaber claymore LIGHTSABER CLAYMORE oh wait that was really silly :v
@tackyvillain that's like sandwich metal but everyone involved is brought to tears more often for no discernible reason
@tackyvillain it's all about layers upon layers, as well as content, okay?
@tackyvillain though t about your last two tweets and the words Sandwich Metal popped into my mind
reading bro team pill's twitter saddens me. Gonna be a lot harder to enjoy their videos now. :(
@DrMelon @johnjoemcbob Mangomangomangomangmango!! Wa-chaa!!

Black Friday is not a thing in Britain. Stop trying to convince us it is.

oh no you didn't #valkyriachronicles YOU DIDN'T JUST D: #plot #nooooo
@floofyscorp my av
*brain quietly simmers trying to process new info*
@tackyvillain I dunno, this is all just extrapolation. I've more to learn it seems :-I
@tackyvillain it's more like your gender seem subconscious rather than things you can consciously change or control or convince yourself
@tackyvillain live and let live eh :v
@tackyvillain 2/2 of belief is the hardest thing of all. Still, you're abs right about respecting their choice, even if I don't understand
@tackyvillain It's a bit like, you can't make yourself to believe in say, a God if you don't deep down believe in God. That fluidity 1/2
@tackyvillain that's where I'm lost. Not only is gender fluid, but it's a conscious choice rather than being what you believe you are :s
@tackyvillain what does it mean to be both/neither binary gender or several genders or more at once? It's like aaaaaa I dun geddit
@tackyvillain oh yeah, can relate more to non-static sexual preference but what does it mean to be male in one situation and female the next
@tackyvillain similarly theres Tri-gender people who supposedly change gender depending on context and I have zero way to relate to that :'I
@tackyvillain Interested but it still confuses the hell out of me. Gender as a fluid thing that can change over a lifetime is a brain-bender

Cops protecting their own. American justice disgusts me. #ferguson.
Largo-san~

#ValkyriaChronicles 
Also the battle against Maximillian's heavy tank. One ill move and your entire team gets mowed down by the tank's MGs.
The armoured car chase is one such example. Wasted a CP moving a unit? GJ, you can't move your tank to block alley and car escapes.
one complaint i have about valkyria chronicles are set piece missions where you have to do everything in a set order or you fail.
@DrMelon MY EYES
Thing is I am absolutely not starving myself. Just choosing lower calorie options, no extras, no treats, log everything I eat.
Currently at 4lbs lost over the past ten days. It was supposed to be 1lb per week!
man for once in my life I ~cannot wait~ to have my HB1C blood test. Wanna get my blood sugar average for my new diet. Gonna be record low!
@ChocnessMonsta Christ, this makes my blood boil. Terrifying pattern of institutional racism and violence. I have no words.
@floofyscorp oof :p
@floofyscorp not the first time the @guardian gets it wrong on matters of a non english-centric nature.
Well its 3am. Guess I'm not sleeping tonight...
@0xabad1dea very common practice among airsofters in the US to paint off the orange tip. :/
@0xabad1dea man, that poor kid. As an airsofter it staggers me how often kids get their hands on realistic Airsoft guns.
God, that poor kid.
@tackyvillain used to have a bunch down at leamington spa when we had a wall projector. That, booze, Tony Jaa movie, awesome :D
Can the UK stop literally copying the US please. Its bad enough our politics are basically American but on a time delay
Urghhh Tescos are taking part in #blackfriday sales when american stores like best buy are stopping that sales stampede crap this year
saw my old game Warheads:Battle appear on google, still drags up some memories Id rather forget abt my last job and how it ended :(
@GoldenBlackHawk i want you to stop everything you are doing and thinking and tell me all you can about that chrome revolver.
Oh yeah, currently at 3-4lbs lost since this time last week :D
see this? 

Best thing. I get to have a curry and not wreck my weight loss!
@SuperBlueBadger all downhill from there, mate! #30yo
@tackyvillain Avoid the 50 shades area of the shop before you find a copy of BoardHerLands or you may be truly lost to fandom
Bike fixed! Proved this by cycling home from the other end of Dundee. :D
Sat in halfords getting my bikes flat tyre fixed. #rubbishatbikes
Since when did buses not allow bikes? Gj national express buses
I'd play more but holy damn im drained after that. I normally hate strategy games too!
Over an hour I'd been in that battle, multiple reinforcements, teammates evac'd, tank almost dead and then victory just like that goddamn.
tagged the flag with the last of Vyse's movement points way out in the open and that counted as a win! My elation was out goddamn loud.
