@RachelNotley @albertaNDP are you paying attention? #minwage #yegbiz  
Never been called a god before! Thanks.!! :-)  
. Interesting idea. Like all policy, has a lot of merit and possibly a chance for misuse.  But better than $15/hr 
@tim3048 fair enough.  I can get behind @JimPrentice paying for the by-election or at least some portion of it given that it's his fault
@tim3048 @paigemacp @canadiantaxfdn @JimPrentice you really want him there when he doesn't want to be? We might as well just pay for it then
@ABeconomist @Rockster but they are supposed to be leaders and represent us. Parts of leadership come from experience.
@ABeconomist @ray1359 @davidakin  all for giving chances but employees get probation, MLAs are in for 4 yrs - little chance of recourse
So they are eager and positive but qualified? What makes one qualified to be an MLA?  
@paigemacp @taxpayerDOTcom keep up the great work and the pressure on our elected officials.  I expect the next 4 yrs will be busy in AB
@canadiantaxfdn says @JimPrentice should pay for by-election.  Couldn't agree more. #ableg By-election is his doing.

@maxfawcett if only a party and leader had the guts to do it.  They all know it's needed, none will do it!
Guess @BarackObama is off the hook on #KeystoneXL Didn't #NDP said they would not push forward?
Only makes sense with reduced personal tax rates. The math can work #nopunintended  
Ok, complaining is over!  @RachelNotley and the #ABNDP are in charge.  Time to try and keep them in line and deal with the hand we're dealt

@HanlonMike agreed, higher income earners may feel less of an impact.  Still doesn't explain why income tax vs consumption.
@HanlonMike higher income tax doesn't affect purchasing power? Less takehome is pay noticeable. Harder to buy groceries No HST on groceries
@HanlonMike GST reduction was a political move. Consumption tax also picks up underground economy they don't pay income tax.
@RuthatVenture @HanlonMike it's already been done in other provinces.  And AB would get some Fed funds to implement.
