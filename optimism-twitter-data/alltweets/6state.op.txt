<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> @DrAttai @BRCAresponder
such strong folks here tonight when we are faced with scalpels and life changing image and physical ability.  Kudos to all! #bcsm
My free advice for tonight having just come off my 3rd surgery in 1 yr. Give yourself time to cry, rest, heal, walk, grieve when ready #bcsm
What will my scars look like and how do I best heal them after surgery.... PT, massage, creams &amp; what type #bcsm
@AnnVanKoughnet If you travel in U.S. save receipts for travel and lodging but not food for medical tax purposes.   #bcsm
Mastectomy post shower = day after; DIEP flap recon.= no shower for 5 days... argh! #bcsm
Usually 10 lbs (gal of milk) weight restriction for a bit after surgery.  Length of time depends on what type #bcsm
@rjhogue @ABHuret @DrAttai @BRCAinfo  Shower chair... great pal in the shower!! #bcsm
I wanted to add that there are sometimes "surgical hangovers" to expect.  Other body parts can be minimally affected by surgery #bcsm
Yoga is great and like Dr. Attai, said, it's adaptable to your needs. #bcsm
Recon for me required abdominal binder and surgical bra 24/7 for at least two weeks.  Depends on type of recon #bcsm
If you have to travel for surgery get all your ducks in a row before hand.  Pharmacy, directions, food sources, caregiver #bcsm
Had tegaderm over my mastectomy so saw it the morning after #bcsm
Please excuse if this seems like self-promoting but I launched this blog a month ago for outreach 
No recliner at home but did the couch with lots of pillows.  Low and easy to get out of @Dr.Attai #bcsm
Pillows are our friends. :-)   #bcsm
@BRCAinfo @stales Requested one at hotel for phase 2.... perfect! #bcsm
They also make cheap seat belt covers with easy velcro attachments at WalMart  #bcsm
@DrAttai  @mchrysopoulo An honest PS will give you realistic outcomes.  So important to ask questions, be prepared  #bcsm
Absolutely.  I couldn't myself.  Had delayed and in the hands of @mchrysopoulo he was able to removed 12 yrs. scars from radiation #bcsm
@DrAttai @stales thanks for that resource #bcsm
Ian, When possible, best outcomes when recon. is at the same time as mastectomy... called immediate. 
 #bcsm
@stales Hit the top surgical centers, MD Anderson, Mayo, Dana Farber, UCSF, Brigham and Women's.... to name a few #bcsm
@BRCAresponder @DrAttai @ZHeatherChamp  So true, Amy #bcsm

Has anyone heard of surgical radio therapy inplants used for radiation to avoid frequent clinic visits? #bcsm
Good point Dr. Dana but do you agree that walking is OK?
 #bcsm
Good to see you @BRCAresponder Hi Amy!
 #bcsm
I was taking short walks, 3-5 blocks a week after mastectomy with drains in pockets.  Important to start when you feel up to it.
 #bcsm
@drjpgiot Much appreciated.
Drains are pains... but painless and shorlived.  A necessary evil
 #bcsm
Double mastectomy recovery not painful.  Came home with pain pump.
