@NigelSmithFood Many thanks to you &amp; the entire team on an good week at The Masters. Now we blow away the customer in St Andrews. Och aye...

@garyplayer @David_Yarrow No, he is not funny at all!! Payback is a bi..ch.
@readDanwrite We missed you at Augusta and you missed a good one. Next year?
@David_Yarrow Ha, it's off to the dungeons for you mate at St Andrews. Travel safely. Until next time. Cheers
@vkeating @TheMasters @garyplayer @brendanMrsBrown @JennyGibney You are an absolute sweetheart and a joy to be around. See you at The Open.
@GKEvents @NigelSmithFood @garyplayer We loved having you guys with us and really hope you will join again at St Andrews for The Open. Best

@scagarette1 I specifically said "warrior" and "role model" which were as much true then as they are today. Seems your ignorance is bliss.
@MattAdamsFoL Ja, ja, except true warriors don't smoke and real role models don't swear in front of children. Shame

Can @MCFC &amp; @BVB still reach the quarter-finals? #UCL 
@GolfDigest Nice!! A real "role model" for young people everywhere. The King!!
@SAFARITALK Many, many thanks indeed. Fantastic &amp; will add to the @garyplayer and Ian Player archives. I miss him terribly...

@GolfDigest This is just not true at all. Poorly researched. Shame on you Golf Digest. No journalistic integrity.
Ha. I just checked and @SAOpenGolf Twitter account follows many local &amp; overseas pros but NOT @garyplayer. Pathetic.

What a simply amazing accomplishment by @garyplayer in the @SAOpenGolf on @Sunshine_Tour. Pity they have no respect. 
@chambleebrandel @GolfweekSchupak Of course. Just gets tiresome when US media generally excludes the rest of the golf world/tours. My best
@GolfweekSchupak @chambleebrandel Which tour? Don't you guys count the rest of the world of golf anymore?

let us celebrate this truly great life #rhino @garyplayer 
@DoinCool Ha. Snarky bastard. Thanks &amp; all the best to you too.
This year I will eat better. Run more. Sleep earlier. Drink more water. More fruit. Read books. Adventure. Talk less. Listen more. Be happy.
Final thought on this subject. Neither @SAOpenGolf nor @Sunshine_Tour have discussed any plans to honor @garyplayer with @BlackKnightIntl
Also, this is @garyplayer 80th year &amp; 50th Anniversary of winning the Grand Slam. Still only @EuropeanTour member to do so. Respect?
@EuropeanTour Just wondering if anyone else finds it strange why @garyplayer isn't hosting the @SAOpenGolf this week? Only won it 13 times.

@GolfDigestMag Is this not from Forgan's Creed the old Scottish poem about golf? Fact check please...
@thomaslevetgolf Just watched the video. Ha, fantastic &amp; great memories as I was their too. All the best. Enjoy South Africa.
@usopengolf My father, Gary Player, all in black, strong, fit, positive &amp; visualizing victory. Respect
@thomaslevetgolf Did you enjoy your time at the GPI? My papi says you were great fun!! All my best, MBP
@GPInvitational @BlackKnightIntl @DJSpoony Spoony you beast!! Looking good as usual mate. Lots of love. Enjoy.
@BeatruxGeen Is this really you? Add a photo &amp; bio. Best
I love this look. Ralph Lauren... 
@alejandro_nagy @garyplayer @claudiaplayer10 @ScottFerrellGPD Muchas gracias Alejandro
Happy Birthday to my Pops @garyplayer. A great father, a total inspiration &amp; a man I respect. I love you very much Dad.
@dcrowephoto My pleasure Daniel. You are welcome anytime.
I love this... 
@si_golf Not true!! Gary Player did so in his 59 during the Brazilian Open in 1974. Get your facts right.
@alechogg Give them hell Alec. Greetings from Shanghai.
@RexHoggardGC So Rex, your unsolicited comments on Gary Player are fine but when he answers a direct question honestly you find fault?
@LukeKerrDineen We all love USA but golf is a global game &amp; top players have always been from all over the world. Recognition is deserved.
@LukeKerrDineen Thank you Luke. It was your fellow panelists that are so biased to US golfers over the years that upsets all internationals.
@GolfDigestMag Would be interesting for you to provide statistics of how PGA Tour players have performed internationally over the years...
@GolfDigestMag When will you wake up &amp; stop placing your ranking emphasis on the PGA Tour &amp; accept the global record of all players?
Home for the next 10 days... 
@NickySummer Thanks Nicky. Trust you are having a fun summer too...
The Seychelles, here we come... 

@LadyGolferMag Haha, too funny...
Happy 4th of July everyone. 
Well done @garyplayer for shooting @ESPNMag Body Issue. Let's hope it inspires people to get off the couch &amp; look after themselves. Proud.
Anyone who thinks we amateurs are using the same ball &amp; equipment as the pros is dreaming. Time for official bifurcation
Happy Father's Day. Easy to become a father not so easy to be a good Dad. Mine is one of the truly special ones. Thank you @garyplayer
@Sports_Greats You really, really need to get your facts straight. Gary Player made this quote NOT Arnold Palmer.
@danjenkinsgd Interesting comment Mr Jenkins. It occurs to me if Gary Player had moved to US &amp; played full time, he would have won 20 majors
