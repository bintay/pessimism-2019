Something I Wore: #jcrew. #marchphotoaday  
Dejection causes us to seek visions & events to see God's power. Yet we never realize that God's @ work in our everyday events. @oschambers
The purpose of prayer is that we get ahold of God, not of the answer. @oschambers #MUFHH
Lust = "I must have it at once." Spiritual lust causes me to demand an answer from God, instead of seeking God himself. @oschambers #MUFHH
Dejection stems from 1 of 2 sources: I have either satisfied a lust or haven't had it satisfied. @oschambers #myutmostforhishighest #MUFHH
