Wade and Reina Rivas: setting up relationship standards high for everyone since forever
The tears are freakin real. It's been a year but it still makes me feel the same way I did before. Now, even stronger. Damn

Epilogue nalang talaga matutulog na ko. God ang hirap pigilan pag si Rivas kainis
Wala grabe padin yung love ko for Wade and Reina. Grabe na. One year strong. Damn
"If I were to choose if I'd stay with Reina or be your Wade Rivas, I'll choose to stay with her, cause I'm not Wade Rivas without her."
Umiyak padin ako sa presscon scene. Grabe
Hay the amount of determination Wade has just to keep Reina with him is ridiculous. I cant even deal
@xndrclln you know me so well???? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
"I will protect you, I promise. Pero hinding-hindi kita ide-deny." Ahhh shit

It's like almost there but not JUST FALL RAIN OKAY JUST FALL 
OTP RIGHT THERE  
"Slowly drifting apart." Ay pota ayun lang
Ang laking pasasalamat na ficlet lang yun bec i wouldnt be able to handle it ok
"That mysterious smile doesn't belong to her anymore." I JUST CANT DO THIS STOP IT

SECOND GOLDEN BUZZER FOR EL GAMMA OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!
BUT IT'S JUST ANNOYING OK LIKE I AM RIGHT NOW WITH ALL THE TWEETS IM TWEETING OKAY SHUTTING UP NOW BYE
Im just so full of rants. Bear with me
Okay whatever
I mean, just bec we're kids doesnt mean we don't make sense. It's ridiculous
And that is why most kids want to grow up fast. They want to be taken seriously. We want to be taken seriously.
The thing about being young is that nobody thinks you are capable of doing something remarkable. They think we're young and stupid.
"I'll treat you like a new iPhone." now THIS is a pick-up line
Okay fine im done with my rant
I mean, curse all you want. Nobody would care. Unless you cross a certain line with a person. Kase tao padin yun, may limitation.
Nagagamit kaseng excuse yung "hindi porket nagmumura, walang alam". Which should not be the case
No matter how annoyed you get, people are still people. They are to be treated as such.
May mga taong puro mura pero marunong rumespeto at marunong trumato ng tao bilang tao. Pero may ibang puro mura lang. Know the difference.
Uy namention pala si Pacman sa kanta ni Hoodie Allen. Gano kadaming kanta na kaya siya namemention?????

It's the snowball effect. Again.
Maybe that's why people get into relationships.
A little bit of appreciation would help me a lot.

The fact that you don't belong to anyone's priorities anymore sucks big time.
