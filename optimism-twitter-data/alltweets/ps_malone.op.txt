Especially with something that happens in fairly small numbers (statistically), need to look at trends, not year-to-year. @CBSNews @ajam
I've complained about @CBSNews and @ajam re the LEO killing report. 2014: 51 2013: 27 2012: 48 2011: 72. Not a spike, a return to baseline.
Not really a meaningful spike. It's a return from a one-year record low. Not a trend. @ajam
Still below the 35-year average. Only "on the rise" relative to an exceptionally low one-year number.  @CBSNews 
This is not "on the rise," @CBSNews "FBI: Number of cops killed on duty rose in 2014" 
@arrroberts Congratulations!
@doinkboy A solid update on regression-based mediation. If we could only get people to move out of the 80s!
@doinkboy Yes, I was Debby's contact for a talk she gave at UT after working with you (I think). BTW, a fan of Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Bolger.
@OliviaKelly_ She did indeed. Took early retirement to have time for "adventures." 40 years ago. And thank you.

@OliviaKelly_ Not necessarily soon. My 20yo son still hugs me and tells me loves me. #DidSomethingRight
@OliviaKelly_ I just followed you at Twitter's guide, and glad! My grandmother died two weeks ago at 99, and I'm enjoying the reminiscences.

Just watched #JohnCarter with Celynd. Fun, but too long/too busy, and very, very Disney.
@mishellbaker You're a fantastic pen-pal (me, less so), headache or not. #GettingTheBallRolling
@rdonoghue Yep. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, so I do the 1/4-caff instead of frontloading so I can stay awake past 7. But same idea.
.@rdonoghue The "all day long" is because it's a self-soothing mechanism, independent of caffeine, which I'm ok with.
.@rdonoghue Likewise. I mostly drink ~1/4-caff all day long, but go to the real things for a mood lift.
Favorite things in #dnd #5e: The subclass system (modulo level complaint) and the spell-slot system.
The other main #dnd #5e complaint is that character sheets are terribly dull for the first level or two, before picking up a subclass.
You get to do more things (especially as a caster--that's back) but you don't really get *good* at things as you level #dnd #5e
One of my main #dnd #5e complaints: Character skill makes too little difference. Proficiency bonus increases much too slowly vs d20 variance
@JoeGKushner Oh, yes--we've loved the first two seasons. @HistoryVikings
Yeah. Having an intelligent opponent rip into the party's lightly-armored mages is appropriate (and terrifying). @redkatartist @SlyFlourish

@mishellbaker The website and official apps don't give me enough control over what I see.

No issues or anything.
@mishellbaker Yeah. I use a third-party program.
@mishellbaker My solution is to never check un-follows, or I'd probably do the same.
@g_so How much does it depend on genre. E.g., caper/heist vs superhero (Superman aside)?
@byharryconnolly Reluctant to favorite that as written, but whatever gets more novels!
@michiexile Fair enough!
@sarahovenall @tshottle @g_so Also a valid reason.
@michiexile No, no. "Woot"
.@tshottle @g_so I used to say the same. But if you have a strong leaning, parties often allocate resources to states based on voter ID.
@ChuckWendig So, as several have said, those who pay more (1st class is special case) board first to get room in the bins.
@ChuckWendig It used to the norm, at least in US. Now I think it's the carry-on problem, an unintended (?) consequence of checked-bag fees.

@womzilla Yes, I responded before reading ahead, sorry. But the "not logged in" issue still holds.
@mishellbaker Ha!
@womzilla Since those are available even if you're not logged in, I have trouble seeing a way around that. They just have to work a little.

@g_so I didn't see BEWITCHED, but I gather it *tried* to be something "inspired by" for current times.
@g_so Right. And some of them are straight-up money grabs. But I think it's fair to distinguish.
@g_so I'd call Syfy's 12 MONKEYS good in itself. Which could happen with GALAXY QUEST, but 12M did it in part by exploring different facets.
@g_so E.g., Coens' TRUE GRIT, while not a movie remake, was still going back to the well, and I thought was near perfection.
@g_so And sometimes remakes/sequels/thematic sequels do improve, though whether attribute to chance or talent is up to you :)
@g_so I think the point varies substantially. But even the flops usually do great first-weekend box office, don't they?
@cjlemire I like new things, too, but formula has its place.
@cjlemire Yeah, but I also understand the appeal of guaranteed box-office with prebuilt audience. Cf. franchises.
Re Galaxy Quest. I'm not broadly anti-remake, but I feel in this case the movie did *exactly* what it set out to. It was a thing complete.

5e states it's usually from political arranged marriages (hence "relatively"). In 4e, it was just finessed. @StephOKingston @Asako_Soh
Recent editions (4 and 5, at least) do address the half-orc origin in reasonably non-rapey fashion. @StephOKingston @Asako_Soh

@DaddyDM @dungeonbeef My college gaming group's Rule #1 is kind of Old-School now: "Never Give the GM Ideas."
@DaddyDM @dungeonbeef Oh, right. I just registered this. "Inspiring" was Warlord. I meant "Magnificent," IIRC, for Bard. Even less similar!
@fredhicks Hope it continues to help!
@dungeonbeef @DaddyDM Had to be really nice to her.
@dungeonbeef @DaddyDM Thank you! I was in another game where the bard (not me) was reluctant to heal. "I'm not that kind of bard."
@DaddyDM @dungeonbeef Yep.
@DaddyDM @dungeonbeef Very much like that, yes! I seem to remember a "wakey, wakey," as well.
@DaddyDM Love it! I had a 4E bard whose "Inspiring Word" (healing) was usually an insult. @dungeonbeef
@TedHayes007 On reflection, my real concern is whether that's a sufficiently narrow criteria set to be well-targeted.

@sarahovenall @womzilla Oh, and the return of @pattonoswalt for the win.
@womzilla @sarahovenall I haven’t started S2 of SHIELD (yay, DVR), but I have to say, I thought S1 stuck the landing.

I’ve been wondering: How much input do (living) authors get into pronunciation of proper nouns in their audiobooks? @audible_com
@saladinahmed Excellent! (from random Internet stranger)

I went to 2 stores back-to-back. By the 2nd I needed a motor cart. Apparently how I activate my invisibility. @LiberatedByGaga @chrislhayes
@sarahovenall @womzilla Probably 1 or 0 after this afternoon. I’ve been working too hard . . .
I’m burning through @ValiantComics ’s collected (new) volumes I bought through @humble. I got the 2nd tier, and these are a *lot* of fun.
@womzilla @sarahovenall Agreed. It did start to ramp up then. That was right before “T.A.H.I.T.I.,” wasn’t it? I just have 2 S1 eps left.
@sarahovenall Good to hear about S2 so far.
@sarahovenall I agree. In hindsight, it felt like the first part of the season (until April!) was padded to wait for the movie.
@sarahovenall I’m ok, even good, with the tie-in, but they could have allotted more than four days.
@sarahovenall I moved before seeing Winter Soldier so I lost half a season of SHIELD. Buying by the episode on Amazon, nearly caught up :S
@BullCityFats @sarahovenall Cool.
Is it bad that I went to "Dead Like Me" first? 
@Sally_Ann_Melia Was that the right link? --it's from February. Mostly hoping there's some news!
.@SamSykesSwears Did you give @scalzi a rock? @scottlynch78 #latereply
@BullCityFats @sarahovenall 18th, then 8th. We have one more trip to South Carolina this month.
@BullCityFats Directions sent.
@BullCityFats Sure. Celynd's just assembled a lasagna. @sarahovenall
@womzilla @BullCityFats @sarahovenall +So we called when we smelled something like an electrical fire that we couldn't track down.
@womzilla @BullCityFats @sarahovenall *And* Fire Dept just left. Not a good day for things to work out. The ceiling fan motor burned out+
@John_Sideris And why does it make any difference to the news? Or anybody?
@BullCityFats Yep. George, I've had a nap. If you want to hang out, you're welcome to come up here, we can get takeout. @sarahovenall
@sarahovenall Oh, no! I'm having a high-CFS day, but was going to make it, but I think this makes it a cancel. Another time. @BullCityFats
@BullCityFats @womzilla Yep. Sadly @TiVo isn't yet compatible with some fiber providers, so not a good investment to make right now.
@BullCityFats @sarahovenall No hat these days, but see you at 1. Did we settle on a place?
.@womzilla I have trouble watching a show without content warnings. Harder to spot when to come off fast-forward.
@womzilla Lightning gave him abs?
@BullCityFats @sarahovenall I'll put in a vote for Ticket To Ride. It's on a shortlist to get to play with my wife, so I'd like to try it.

@g_so Whereas we're stuck with Flexeril
Codex Alera by @longshotauthor is not only excellent fantasy, it ends! @boymonster
@sarahovenall Nor would I expect it! Only MDs do that :)
.@saladinahmed I do see "Christianist" (or "Dominionist"), but pretty much only used as sarcasm to make the same point you do here.
@MaryRobinette Thanks. Just grumping :). It's not bad enough that I ask for a wheelchair down the jetway, which would work better.
A distinct lack in social sciences, as well. The only psychology work to ever win took it in Economics. @readingape
.@sarahovenall And specifically interacting in the Ph.D.'s role as university prof.
.@TiresiasBC @rdonoghue Time for my all-time favorite movie quote again, from "Harvey" 
@scalzi Welcome to my world!
@saladinahmed Optimist.
.@MaryRobinette In other words, I never hear my name, so lose my pre-board :(
.@MaryRobinette I have disabled priority access, &amp; they now call names instead of vague "preboard." But I'm also hard of hearing. #latereply
@jennablack That's why it's important to put things like "nap" on the list. One more think checked off!

I'm not a DOCTOR WHO watcher, but I'm loving David Tennant as Richelieu is @BBCAMERICA 's THE MUSKETEERS.
@readingape Oh, and it would have to never spontaneously revert to "top stories."
@readingape In a heartbeat.

@Nalo_Hopkinson Yep. #ChronicFatigueSyndrome, too, though with less pain. Naptime instead of plans!
@ProfBanks Wonderful feeling, isn't it? - congratulations! @boymonster @FELTit @saladinahmed
@Morrus @boymonster might have the best information.
If I'm writing a review, I want it to send the tweet when I save the review, not before! @goodreads @jennablack
Dangit. That was 4 stars for The Gifted Dead by @jennablack. I just can't get the hang of @goodreads tweet system. 
I'm #reading The Gifted Dead by Jenna Black 
@13thAge Any notion when #13TrueWays will be available as PDF-only? Itching to get my metaphorical hands on it.
@g_so Marginally increased life expectancy!

@jenphalian I can't carry much weight, so my Kindle is a lifesaver when traveling.
@jenphalian That, I understand.
Or Gigi, for that matter. Though that's probably less likely in the 21st century. @boymonster
@jenphalian E-books and free reader apps?

To clarify, I buy digital comics, but I'm talking about navigation. Download speed is pretty good. @ImageComics
+for me, even not on Wednesdays. Very slow. Is this a widespread issue? Is there any hope of change soon?  @ImageComics
Hey, @ImageComics. I love and buy many of your titles, and prefer to buy directly from you for one less middleman. But your site is slow+
Or at least I assume countering piracy is the reason. I'd love to own PDFs. #DnD5e @BullCityFats @Wizards_DnD
.@BullCityFats I'm just looking at the free Basic Rules. Sadly, no legal PDFs of the PHB, in @Wizards_DnD's misguided anti-piracy efforts.
.@BullCityFats FWIW, I'm intrigued by #DnD5e . It seems to skim some of the best parts of 3x, without (yet) faltering under its own weight.

Neeson turned in a creditable Alfred Kinsey in a pretty good movie. @dmoren @saladinahmed

.@loganbonner No. No, I cannot. Because it would be a lie. #Windows10 #WindowsWhatNow @chainsawsuit
@g_so Ouch.
@g_so That's fair. But it's still easy for me to see the complaints about inconsistency.
@g_so Agreed. I meant his apparent lack of concern about it.
.@g_so Both were in their way, but I found one moreso across versions of Superman than the other.
.@g_so Yeah. I thought the vast collateral damage in MAN OF STEEL was more at odds with Superman stories than the other thing at the ending.
@NC_Comicon Ah, after I got a favorite but no reply yesterday, I just picked a day, since prices go up soon. No worries.
@Grimmshade Is this the game Ivric is in? Just curious. @13thAge
I simply don't have the stamina for a full weekend. @NC_Comicon
Bought a Saturday ticket to @NC_Comicon , even though I don't know what's happening on Saturday vs Friday or Sunday. Will enjoy no less.
Don't get me wrong: I enjoy the faster pacing of most current films. But a bit of nostalgia, no less.
Related bit about older genre films: Encouraged to pay attention to detail for more than Easter Eggs.
Obviously, some still do, but it's a definite change in pattern. Along with the much slower pacing of 80s genre movies than modern.
We watched BLADE RUNNER ("The Final Cut," because handy) last night. Odd that movies used to encourage you to think about what was going on.
Today is the 30th #NCPride. I physically can't march, but I can do this much. And buy lunch for two marching friends.
