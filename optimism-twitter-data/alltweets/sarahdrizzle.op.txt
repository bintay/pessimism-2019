@ben__wyatt I'm glad I'm watching this show just so I could see that
just watched david duchovny fall over a bush which has been the best part of californication so far
when laxatives don't work you know you're fucked
@AdamxBevel I CANT
@celestialkittyy that's scary af wtf
@celestialkittyy YEAH IM GONNA TEXT U BC IM ANGRY
@celestialkittyy I don't blame u!!!! I probably would too!!
@celestialkittyy that's probably smart haha
I lose respect for everyone I see interact w him especially when I KNOW they know
@celestialkittyy why would he stop you
oh my god!!!! I'm so mad!I'm so angry!!!!! how can u act like you're so educated and progressive and then be friends w that piece of shit!!!
oh my god!!!! how can u speak openly about feminism and be friends with a known rapist??!!!!! oh my god!!!!!
hank should break up with Karen she turned into a huge bitch after they got back together he should date trixie the hooker instead
seriously though, no way david duchovny gets as much ass as he gets in californiacation
why don't laxatives work instantly
WOW that nannying job fell through in the worst way and the moms were sooo mean to my cousin ugh I'm. MAD
@celestialkittyy it's a good movie if you can handle the ableism in it
@celestialkittyy and we've gotta pull a scam on someone
@celestialkittyy it's got Steve martin in it it's got a bunch of ableist humor or whatever but it's about scam artists
@celestialkittyy have you ever seen the movie dirty rotten scoundrels ?
@celestialkittyy omg I bet we'll have to go when you're 21
@celestialkittyy omf I've never been to Vegas before
@celestialkittyy when I'm rich and famous someday we can travel-party together my treat lol
@celestialkittyy I can imagine!! I wish I could afford to travel like that that's so amazing. I'm so glad you're having this time
@celestialkittyy when are u gonna be here again?
@celestialkittyy I am too!!! I'm also excited to see you!!!!!!!!!!!
@celestialkittyy yes!!! I'm probably getting a nannying job for 425 a. week and if not i have an opportunity to bar tend
@celestialkittyy what why
@celestialkittyy BUT if you wanted to come back I would SO room with you!!!
@celestialkittyy it's probably nowhere near as nice as your place tho
@celestialkittyy it was 780 i think. I can't remember ATM
and it's in mchenry hell yeahhhh
but yeah just found one where rent even if I found only 1 person to move out with would be less than one weeks pay w this nannying job
u CANT break up cause we'd have a lease
I wanna move out with a couple so we can share the rent of a 2 bedroom apartment 3 ways
someone move out with me :///////
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe @ben__wyatt like it's just something I do because my life is boring
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe @ben__wyatt like I'd never have sex again and be fine with it bc it's rlly mediocre
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe @ben__wyatt it's ok it's not all that great honestly
@taylorswift13 why did u hire a known child molester for your video and why are u also friends with her in your personal life
happy Mother's Day tiny mother @GillianA
@The_VolcanoBoy @CameronGrom last night Cameron made Sarah's drug brain think he was dying or something along those lines
(not rlly)
I feel like I'm legitimately dying from this pain and haven't been able to keep down Vicodin all day I'm gonna go shoot heroin or smth
@neozuxe @ben__wyatt @meme_princesa_ let's just all shame each other for fucking everyone honestly
@mooveitorloseit omg
#youtubefandomhonestyhour down with john green down with nerdfighters
#youtubefandomhonestyhour YouTube is trash everyone on there is trash you people fucking ruined my adolescence fuck all of you
@Buttfunk I ate a whole salad at chilis and then puked it up when I got home
@Buttfunk I threw up at aria last night too. *shakes fist at sky* VICODIN!!!
allergies are weird bc you're sniffling and  there are tears and your face is puffy and ppl ask why you're crying and you're like im not
@AdamxBevel 
I threw up my whole casadilla explosion salad. I'm just glad I didn't throw up in chilis. happy Mother's Day.
@Buttfunk oooh hell yeah not today though cause I just threw up lmaoooo
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I'm srry. it's nuts when it happens but I get off so rarely that it rarely does
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe like it's much easier for me to cum once I already came
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe ya see once I get there I can cum like 30 times in a row
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe yeah I feel. like I've gotten penises off in like under a minute w my mouth before
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe quickest I've ever cum was 15 minutes :(
@neozuxe @meme_princesa_ I don't think I'd be the same :////// it's just so hard 4 me (hard haha)
@neozuxe @meme_princesa_ if I'm not in the mood I'll never cum. never.
@meme_princesa_ @kittynoise @neozuxe I'm so glad u understand not like glad u go thru it too tho
@meme_princesa_ @kittynoise @neozuxe average masturbation for me = half an hour it's terrible and hurts after awhile
omg @latinadelreyx when @celestialkittyy comes into town u guys can help me pick out a vibrator like we said omg
@meme_princesa_ @kittynoise @neozuxe I can't get off from just penetration so I'd never be able to just get a dildo
@meme_princesa_ @kittynoise @neozuxe INCREDIBLE
@meme_princesa_ @kittynoise @neozuxe my friends wanna take me to this sex shop in Chicago and help me pick out a vibrator soon
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe that's so innovative
@kittynoise @meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I'm 21 and have been inside multiple sex shops and idk
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I don't even HAVE a dildo. or any sex toys. I'm so boring
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I just reread it and it made sense
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe oh I read the words in the wrong order
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe was the word stuck supposed to be in there somewhere
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe once I left a sharpie under a light at work and it got so hot that it exploded. not in my ass tho
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe like in your ass????
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe thank god
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe dude there is no too in depth with me honestly
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe FUCK I'd be afraid of ink poisoning
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe was it still in there
mom wanted me to go to church w her for Mother's Day but instead I'm on twitter talking about 8 foot dildoes and sticking things up yr ass
@neozuxe @meme_princesa_ I was thinkin that too
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I wish I was more adventurous so I had stories like this
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe oh my GOD did u play the kazoo after
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I honestly. don't think anything in here has been in my ass :/ I think abt it a lot tho
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I always wonder what I can fit up there like I'll look around a room and be like "I wonder if I could take that
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe what if it was very thin and you used it as a belt
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe what if u got a tank for large snakes and u put all the lights and bedding in it but just put a dildo in there
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe I HEARD ABT THAT OH MY GOD
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe HOW WOULD YOU STORE IT
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe CAN U IMAGINE
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe is it straight tho like hard plastic or floppy
To all you mother's who haven't....…
@neozuxe @meme_princesa_ thts probably a better plan honestly that's prob what I would do if I had an 8 foot dildo
where are all of my DRUG CHILDRENs Mother's Day posts
@neozuxe @meme_princesa_ it's ok we're far away 8 feet won't reach
@neozuxe @meme_princesa_ maybe it's double sided and u and your friend can fuck each other from across the room or something
@doctorhawrse I lived there 8 months and I got eaten out 3 times for a grand total of probably 6 minutes
@doctorhawrse this seriously sounds like yr talking abt my ex he was SO BAD like sex with him HURT and it wasn't cause he was big just BAD
@doctorhawrse same so when I take a good one I'll keep it on my phone and show all my friends when I see them
@meme_princesa_ @neozuxe EIGHT FOOT DILDO
I WISH I could show everyone this nude but my FACE IS IN IT sso
@doctorhawrse ya u r
I took a nude where I look SO sassy. like the sassiest picture I've ever taken but I just so happen to be naked. it's a work of art tbh
@doctorhawrse like he's the one that brought it up at all??? makes NO sense
I love that when ppl fuck w me I can sick my son  @wavegrave  on them <PURPLE HEART>
fucking unfollow me if you think I talk about my diagnosed mental illnesses too much on my own social media???????????????
you dont just fucking respond to shit like that and then don't explain yourself?he made literally no sense and is mocking me on my own page?
are you saying I fake my PTSD? are you saying I talk about it too much? I wanna know what this fucking means 
@Aricin_Grey like am I missing something here like are you trying to joke around or are you just actually being that big of a dick right now
@Aricin_Grey why would this ever loop around to talking about my PTSD?? you made literally no sense and were an asshole in the process
@Aricin_Grey are you seriously bringing up and mocking my PTSD for literally no reason right now?? what the fuck is wrong with you?
@Aricin_Grey ....what
living across the street from a park is great until a baseball game happens and then dad's are screaming outside your window for 3 hours
PETA IS A HORRIBLE ORGANIZATION WHY ARE PPL STILL SUPPORTING THEM
@meme_princesa_ just cause the fans of something are a bunch of emos doesn't make it emo
@meme_princesa_ RIGHT
@neozuxe it me
@sarahdrizzle read this in an Italian accent because of that rogue a
I had a dream that my friends a we're being problematic and I can't calm myself down even tho it was just a dream
@paleman_ RELATABLE
every once in awhile i decide im Trash and listen to tom milsom in a private spotify session im ashamed to be me
i honestly care so much about the jonas brothers id drop everything to go to a reunion concert
MULDERS BEING SO LOWKEY RACIST
I'm so glad I slept through that ep the first time
I'm so MAD abt that episode like I UNDERSTAND WHY but just WHY ya know why'd chris carter have scully get attacked by a CAT
whatever you do in life do not watch s3e18 of the x files don't FUCKIN DO IY
@ARKHAMCHICAGO I'll tour w you and be yr opening act and just rehearse scenes from the seinfeld
all I hope for in the x files revival is better-working flashlights
@DanielXRedmond I don't think anyone would even care
THERE WAS A PIECE OF INTESTINES IN A TREE
I think I slept through this episode on my original watch through because this is the most ridiculous shit I've ever seen
@J_Conlee "salmon fish"
I can't believe a guy got killed by a mystical jaguar on the x files and he was driving a jaguar
I just wanna watch x files without seeing my tiny mother be hurt or scared
and none if this makes sense to me so I don't expect it to make sense to u and idk why I'm tweeting abt this bye
I feel bad being pan bc Im Straight Passing enough and aro so I don't date ppl and I feel invisible but dont feel like I should feel visible
like I feel Bad for feeling nb because I'm not enough nb to be discriminated against
- cause I am a dfab and I don't ever feel like a Boy but sometimes I don't feel like a Girl and I'm not enough nb to call myself that
like I've never felt cis enough to call myself cis but I don't feel trans enough to be trans and I feel bad calling myself a Demi girl -
whenever there's something I """identify""" with I don't feel like I'm enough of that thing to identify with it
it's ace day of visibility or w/e and I'm aro and wanted to post a selfie but I feel like I'm not Ace Enough and ppl would think I'm faking
@lnperks I want this on my tombstone
californiacation is good but david duchovny is so crusty and I know that's the point but he's so... so crusty...
I can imagine that this shit is what childbirth feels like
so u know how opiates make u constipated?
IM FUCJING PISSING MYSELF
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN 
OH MT GOD NO 
david duchovny is so crusty and gross but I'd honestly fuck him in a heartbeat but I can't say that w/o thinking of 
@fefifohannah agree w both of these tweets!! plus ppl w vaginas reactions to oral are better
@MyAlyNameIsHi that would be amazing! the job I'm prob getting will make it so I have every weekend off too so I'll be easier
@MyAlyNameIsHi miss you too!!! why do we have to be so far :(((
sorry I get heated abt the cunilingus to filatio ratio
and TRUTHFULLY?? the natural taste of vaginas is good. there's always variation in that but like... way way WAY better tasting than dick
and can we stop expecting vaginas to taste like a fruit salad???!! vaginas are supposed to taste like VAGINAS
cunilingus is honestly probably more important than filatio because a lot of ppl w vaginas (me) can't cum from penetration
people who don't give oral are weak
I had a sex dream about @celestialkittyy and it was <SMIRKING FACE>
@latinadelreyx I'm not gonna but I'm not going to have any remorse about leaving that place
@bourgeois_bitch yeah but it's also about a bigger issue
I'm in the middle of the most painful shit of my life tbh
sometimes I see a bralette and I’m like wow that’s so pretty and delicate and i probably couldn’t even fit my areola in there
also if I get this nannying job I could move out which would be so!!!! cool!!!!!
if I get this nannying job that would be cool cause I could tell my current boss to fuck off with her ableist reasons for not promoting me
@Josseppe95 I just had pizza #twins
not ALLOWING your partner to take steps towards transitioning IS abuse
being unsupportive of your partners gender is horrible. telling your partner "I fell in love with a girl" or w/e makes u trash
why would you upload pix from yr significant others past b4 they came out as trans that obviously make them upset and uncomfortable
tbh @kittynoise looked fly af on tv
@xbossanova I'll listen to it soon!
the most unrealistic thing about californiacation is how much ass david duchovny gets
I was on too much Vicodin to cook so I tried to order a pizza but I'm on too much Vicodin for that too and idk if it's coming or not
@sarahdrizzle turns out I was just tired
why am I so anxious all of a sudden??? why am I so paranoid that something is wrong ???
come over and take a nap with me
@grumpmaster300 that sounds like so much fun but I'm on a lot of Vicodin and can't drive
@ben__wyatt COME HERE NOW
I'll fucking give u Vicodin if u come over
@latinadelreyx so tomorrow?? perfect

@Orphaneren holy shit I wanna do that
drugs are so cool I feel so great and optimistic right now I feel like so loved and loving and important and everyone is amazing and great
@Orphaneren I AM ON VICODIN I AM NOT GOING TO VIDCON I WILL NEVER GO TO VIDCON
what does sex on Vicodin feel like I need 2 know right now
Vicodin is weird bc u can feel so lonely but so amazing but also feel nothing all at the same time and it's rlly incredible
fucking kiss me or something I feel manic but also numb but also great but also lonely fuckin
why am I still awake when I'm on so much Vicodin
trans friends!!! u r important and I love u !!! be safe and sleep well
ugh someone tell me how pretty I am pls pls I'm craving attention
I love spooning so much
my ideal relationship is someone comes over and sleeps in my bed and plays w my hair while I fall asleep and then I wake up and they leave
date me
*wants a relationship but is aromantic* nice
I just got a babysitting job 425 a week starting at the end of the month holy shit
<PILL>cute Vicodin pix <PILL> 
@latinadelreyx noooo that's super bad for doggies their bodies aren't made to be vegan
I love being able to sleep in and not having to work or any responsibilities at all it's so nice aaahhhh
I wonder if there will ever be a time even I don't hate myself

"honey that's called addiction"
I think opiates make me wanna have sex cause it's been awhile since I was horny and suddenly BOOM GIMME ALL THE GENITALIA
kinda hoping I broke my back because I won't have to work and I get a lot of Vicodin SO win win except the pain
I'm so glad that I have friends that convince me to do the things I already wanna do even if they're prob bad for me
wise words from @wavegrave

@MirandaNewbyy yesss im so down lets have a movie night!!!!
@MirandaNewbyy amazing i must watch it
@MirandaNewbyy i know dude theres so many movies i havent seen
@MirandaNewbyy honestly i havent
@MirandaNewbyy were the cutest friends honestly
@MirandaNewbyy id prolly fuck an alien tbh
@MirandaNewbyy still a good hashtag
HOW IS EVERYONE IN THE WORL D NOT ADDICTED TO OPIATES
im so high and in no pain i LOVE VICODIN
@MirandaNewbyy rlly good hashtag
@MirandaNewbyy YES

A L I E N S
@MirandaNewbyy its ok our friendship is 2 strong to crumble under their will
@MirandaNewbyy i miss u so much!!! i like how weve tried to hang out 3 days in a row and THINGS KEEP HAPPENING TO SEPARATE US
ALSO disallowing yr partner to talk to certain ppl is disgusting. if yr that insecure in yr relationship maybe its not the relationship 4 u
trust is one of themost important parts of a relationship and needing to check their phone is rlly unhealthy and like manipulative???
if u have to read their messages to feel assured that theyre not cheating on u its probably not a very healthy relationship tbh
looking at your partners phone is such an invasion of privacy
@TheThirdPew two pieces of trash :/
in so much pain i took a vicodin and i forgot how fun vicodin is
I've got whiplash :/
@latinadelreyx meeee
yik yak said my post was offensive because it said "white people" in it uh ok
@latinadelreyx the car key is also inside. Hannah's coming to pick me up
locked out of my fucking house and my parents are hater buttoning me because they're in church!!! once again god is more important than me
@Orphaneren this would honestly be the dream
his name is Darrin manning by the way
they didn't even give a reason for the stop and frisk. he was with his whole basketball team but he was the only one put in handcuffs
his testicles were destroyed and he had to be in a wheel chair and he was given charges of battery and resisting arrest
@Orphaneren chihuahuas would be smart cars
a 16 year old black child was stopped and frisked and his testicles were squeezed so hard that they POPPED but police brutality isn't real
@Orphaneren WE COULD FIT SO MANY PEOPLE ON THERE
@mewbur THIS IS SO CUTE I LOVE I GUYS IM OBSESSED
@Orphaneren horses kinda freak me out tbh let's ride giant dogs
@Orphaneren YEP! it would cost more than te car is worth to fix
@Orphaneren my car broke down yesterday :/
#JosephKent was kidnapped. that was not an arrest. they didn't have time to read him his rights or explain why he was being arrested.
BULL. SHIT.  
why does towing cost so much money like "I know yr car just broke down and have no way to get to work now but that'll be 300 dollars"
@YUHB0Y @jamiestonchus let's fuckin beat him up
I JUST RAN INTO SOMEONE I HAVENT SEEN IN 7 YEARS WTF
@Orphaneren yes please!!
she's a rainbow by the Rolling Stones is so important
my dad just showed me the place my parents spent their wedding night.......
yeah forcing religion on people will TOTALLY fix the problem 
me flirting: "do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?"
@doctorhawrse yeah that's the same thing I'm wondering I drove past it today and it looked solid?? but idk !
billy ray cyrus is like the human version of a meme 
@YUHB0Y South American milf would be a good name for a band
@doctorhawrse there's a 2 bedroom house in Woodstock for 500 a month. I was gonna see if it was good but now I have a major car repair
spent 2 hrs hangin out with a guy in a computer shop that my car broke down in front of but its ok cause he was hot and gave me cigarettes
my car broke down and I'm stuck in mundelein

@ARKHAMCHICAGO they're HUGE nerds
I'm smoking hookah outside n chilling w my dogs and it's so nice and the birds are chirping and I'm just really glad I got out of bed today
@ben__wyatt psychosis it'll b ok haha
@ben__wyatt ya!! you just gotta be careful ALSO smoking weed on antipsychotics is fine and feels exactly the same so if u start experiencing
@ben__wyatt SHOW ME A PIC
@ben__wyatt tru
at least were in this capitalist hell together
@ben__wyatt let her know that weed brings out psychosis in ppl that are already susceptible to it but it doesn't cause psychosis
@ARKHAMCHICAGO don't ever be sorry
why'd my parents have to surprise me w tickets to the symphony on the day arkham is playing with the color morale
@ben__wyatt hey that's a big step in opening future convos abt ur mental illness and other things 2!!
although Rosie the riviter played a huge part in woman joining the workforce, she is war propaganda. remember that.
@kittynoise I will!! and I'll bring my 6'5" 350 lb dad with me hahah
I also might be getting a job as a bar tender which would be SICK
I'm also gonna drive to Woodstock and drive by that house that's 500 a month
idk I'm really motivated today and I've cleaned my room and organized my closet and done laundry so far and I'm gonna walk my dog
lost so many Facebook friends last night it felt so good
my phone recognizes gillovny as a word
@kittynoise yesss bring more people to this gillovny hell that we live in
I was going to go to bed early tonight but then injustice happened
how do people still deny that white privilege exists oh my god
@kittynoise I'm so sorry... that is awful
@kittynoise wow wtf that IS bs
@MirandaNewbyy THATS WHAT IM SAYING I'm trying to not get excited tho because it seems too good to be true IDK
@kittynoise like idk I lived in absolute filth for 8 months I can handle basically everything
@kittynoise I can do absolutely disgusting for 500 dollars.
@MirandaNewbyy if you got a job around here you could afford that very easily. I could afford it on happy jacks salary which is not a lot
@MirandaNewbyy if that's not a property scam then it'd be 250 for each of us plus about 150 split between us for utilities (probably less)
@MirandaNewbyy fucking live with me Miranda
I found a 2 bedroom house in Woodstock for 500 a month. that has to be a property scam right? like there's no way
please fucking get out of my life if you think that distraction of property is a bigger problem than police brutality

my master plan involves about a year of saving and 2-3 other people willing to live with me lmao
I have a master plan to move back to Washington and it probably won't work but well see
apparently I should be over it by now. sorry if I could get over it I would I don't choose to be traumatized
the whole victim vs survivor thing is such bullshit. I am a victim of abuse an I survived it. I can be both. stop invalidating my abuse
why are people such trash?? why can't u just let me live my life?? why is my trauma any of ur business??
@ ppl telling me not to be a victim ... I literally am a victim and I will act like one and not apologize for my fucking PTSD thank u
it would be great if I could live in Washington without, ya know, getting abused
I miss Washington and all my babes so much
I'm gonna marry hummus

PTSD sucks cause you can be having a regular conversation and then something that's said triggers you and suddenly you're having a flashback

I have too much anxiety for my own good
I don't want to work at happy jacks anymore. that place is so terrible and soul sucking and SERIOUSLY I want to die when I'm there
you can't schedule me 12 days in a row and then tell me I'm not emotionally ready to become a manager
I'm literally not being promoted because I have bipolar disorder
I work twice as hard as everyone else to be able to just be able to function and then I'm told I can't be a manager because of my mood OK

@The_VolcanoBoy and just because you dont find something personally offensive doesnt mean its not problematic to say. im not trying to -
@The_VolcanoBoy so say people with vaginas don't equate vagina to female that's what was cissexist about it
@The_VolcanoBoy well ok the original post was pretty misogynistic, and on top of that cissexist but I know you probably didn't mean anything
@The_VolcanoBoy sex =/= gender

why is lohanthony on my newsfeed..............
my dad bought cheese called "slim cut Swiss" and my first thought was a very thin person from Switzerland
wyd 
@mewbur it's ok!!
@mewbur do u want company I'm so bored
"I don’t experience romantic attraction" "you just need to find the right person!" no you don’t understand
DO SOMETHING WITH ME TONIGHT
do you ever see a link that is so obviously a rick roll but something sick inside of you makes you click it anyway
why would you go to commercial in the middle of a song I just wanna watch the animals wreck the camp
I want it to be summer 
kid cudi was on scorpion
"why isn't it fast forwarding???" "mom this is live tv"
feminism addresses men's issues, but it shouldn't have to to be valid
@J_Conlee agreeed!!!
@J_Conlee it's comforting to know I'm not alone
@J_Conlee there are so many cool ppl in the scene but there's an overwhelming amount of assholes involved
I can't poop with a shirt on :/
@bourgeois_bitch LOVE HER
DRUG GRANDMA
I don't remember the last time I showered ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
love cop shows but hate cops
@noiamnotawitch omg I hope so
@noiamnotawitch I didn't see your tweet before I posted that haha
@noiamnotawitch I'm talking about the 7th episode of snl but go you
there's like commentaries on racism and then there's actual racism and it's wild
there's a lot of commentary on white privilege that seems way before it's time on here it's awesome
watching the 7th episode of snl ever
@Aricin_Grey the group started with slut shaming so I mean
*sends death and rape threats* "it's about ethics in journalism"
@meme_princesa_ I'm p tall
forever 21 mail day!!!!
@HereisSomeLove thanks that's pretty cool that you made this bot it's really nice
I don't think I have enough to kill me and I don't want to survive another suicide attempt so I guess I'll just keep trying to sleep
if I'm dead I don't have to work tomorrow so I mean
kinda feel like taking the rest of those vicodin and drinking the whole bottle of rum that's in my room haha lol
I might tell them I had insomnia (which is obviously true) and then say I'll come in if they can't find anyone else to work
can I call into work because I'm depressed
the only people that like me I only interact with on social media people don't like me irl
every time I think someone is my friend I find out they actually hate me and that's been the case since I was fucking 6 years old
I'd say I want to die but I think that's a little dramatic
goodnight I guess
and now I'm back to not having a social life
now I feel like I can never go back to the one place I finally felt comfortable and welcomed  because people hate me there apparently
yo why do I care so much that people are talking shit about me because I'm a feminist like I shouldn't give a fuck but instead I'm crying
im going to bed
HES ONLINE TOO IM SUCH AN ASSHOLE
like im sure he didnt see it but what if he DID
i liked mikey way's 1 year sobriety coin post and then i remembered my name is DRUG MOM and i feel like an asshole i hope i dont trigger him
TOOK THE CUTEST BOOTY PIC
@celestialkittyy yes pls &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@celestialkittyy im so in love w u
thats the 2nd time ive posted "STRAIGHT EDGE DRUG MOM" on twitter but i just think its so funny
STRAIGHT EDGE DRUG MOM
sometimes i consider becoming straight edge just because of how funny it would be
sometimes pictures of dogs make me tear up
there was a post that was "the signs in relationships" and gemini was "will be alone forever" and ive honestly never been more relieved
i love brand new almost as much as i hate myself
@noiamnotawitch @Shelbzdung that would be amazing holy moly

a platonic nudes club
"god dammit @AdamxBevel " is a thought I have at least once a day
*nudes...
I want a friend that I can platonically exchange nude with

@bourgeois_bitch @The_VolcanoBoy @Courtney_Dearly @noiamnotawitch Courtney to come into town??
@Courtney_Dearly I do that too while patting them and sometimes making happy noises
I can't hug someone without doing the mom pat
 said to speak of many things.
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of Hot balls!
The nightman…
I'm also watching good morning Vietnam

@lnperks @meme_princesa_ well I'm seeing arkham no matter what
@meme_princesa_ @lnperks DAMMIT
@lnperks there's an arkham and the honeydips show on March 7th that's like 2 seconds from my house (johnsburg moose lodge) and I'm p pumped
@lnperks lmao I'm so sorry
@lnperks yeah for sure I don't think I'd go if I didn't have so many friends involved
@lnperks @meme_princesa_ we went to a show last month in Chicago and it was great even tho her car broke down
@lnperks god who did u see it's not like that at all
@lnperks I'm also friends with a lot of lake county bands so I try to support my friends ya know?
@lnperks I can't get out to Chicago a lot cause I don't have a car and trains are expensive but I'd rather go to Chicago shows
@lnperks some of the best friends I've ever made i met in the lake county scene but there's a lot of bullshit that goes on and assholes too
@lnperks he used to be in widower but he got kicked out because he is a rapist. I don't know if he is currently in a band
@noiamnotawitch FOR REAL.
@lnperks peter massouros
@ lake county band scene: why do y'all associate with a known rapist
why does every song on the radio reference michelle pfeiffer
@noiamnotawitch when were you straight edge tbh
@EhJovan good
@sarahdrizzle never forget
@mooveitorloseit I texted like the top people I texted last I will text u rn
proof that iPhones are better than androids

what's updog
@danielle_jewitt not as much as some people. it's ok every once in awhile. it can just be rlly triggering to people w eating disorders
@danielle_jewitt not aimed @ u jsyk
u can go to the gym without posting side-by-side comparisons every day. u can be proud but be aware of how potentially triggering that is
when I see a "progress" post I think about the poor person with an ED who's seeing it and deciding they're not eating that day
I'm happy that you're happy and healthy but I gotta tell u I don't give a shit about your weightloss journey
why does @jimmyfallon not only have a sexual predator but an abuser on his show tonight? 
team amber rose TBH tbh
I was just feeling good abt my job but now I get to be guilted over this :))
it's not my fault that my work is scheduling me at 3 I have no control over that
@actuallyriles u should have done it anyway
my dad's mad at me because I'm working too much? ok
rip my beautiful friend with a beautiful soul. you don't have to be in pain anymore 
it's really hard to breathe. cancer is such a bitch.
I just found out that one of the first internet friends I ever made has passed away. I am overcome with sadness. rip @SammieZessin
@AdamxBevel <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I miss @AdamxBevel
@SUPERF1C1AL safe sex is important for EVERYBODY its one of the most important things u can learn!!
@SUPERF1C1AL exactly if i do have a daughter imma make sure she is educated and informed because the schools arent gonna do that
if i ever have a daughter and she grows up to be a "slut" thats honestly the least of my concerns
@Goobertk sorry im so bad at communication and hanging out
@Goobertk i adore u dad
i online shopped and i spend my entire forever 21 giftcard
i want to online shop :/
@bourgeois_bitch @noiamnotawitch they can
I can't stop thinking about how lonely my bird must be. he hasn't been alone in the almost 9 years we've had him :(((
@vicoding you can do p much whatever you want in college as long as you don't disturb other peoples learning
laughing so hard that I'm crying at an episode of everybody loves Raymond I've seen probably 10 times I am my father
I think I'm gonna buy a vape with my paycheck cause I'm a douchebag
@vicoding IVE SEEN THIS ONE TOO
I've watched probably 4 episodes of friends in my life and I've already seen this one
this picture is amazing 
still crushing on gordo to this day
anyway I get paid Tuesday who wants to go shopping
I can't believe I will have worked 28 hours this week after tomorrow. that's like unheard of at happy jacks. pickin up every shift I can
RIP my fine feathered friend 
my bird is in the process of dying right now. :(
I WILL FLY TO BOSTON FOR YHAT
@noiamnotawitch let me text you
@noiamnotawitch they let you make phone calls and honestly if you're feeling this way maybe that would be best.
@noiamnotawitch don't do anything ok? if you feel like you're in danger of doing something go to the hospital immediately
@noiamnotawitch that is a positive thing. are you safe?
I hate timehop 
maybe instead i could go to washington for my birthday omg
i might run into zac but i honestly dont care ill just beat him up or something
i wanna be in washington for hempfest when is it
@monotonewitch my ex said hed take me last year and then said we didnt have enough money so i picked up a shift and then he wound up going
ke$ha went to tk around the time they wanted to send me. imagine if i was in residential with ke$ha
how is ke$ha doing? i know shes out of timberline knolls but how is she DOING? i care about ke$ha so much
i cant stop coughing and my lungs hurt this is how it ends on valentines day with acid in my lungs
i accidentally inhaled some acid today. not the fun kind either. the kind that melts your skin.

hipster trash 
@MartyGil 2 cutiez in that pic
SHAMROCK SHAKES ARE BACK HOLY SHHIIIIITTT

@wavegrave @davidduchovny OH NO
I want david duchovny to publicly address the duchovmeme
@wavegrave but does he KNOW
I woke up from a nap and that was the first thought I had
does david duchovny know what memes are
@meme_princesa_ for REAL
Gus's sympathetic crying is one of the funniest running gags in psych
@fefifohannah DAT BULGE THO
@MrEmilyHeller I really hope that works out!! my birthday is June 2nd wink wink wink
@MrEmilyHeller COME 2 CHICAGO
doctor: actually Mike you have three different diseases from stress and another two from ha…

I <SPARKLING HEART> @velvetgrunge happy bday princess &lt;33333
@velvetgrunge <GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART>
@J_Conlee I'm alienfemme <EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALIEN><NAIL POLISH>
@jamiestonchus @phat_leee @MeninistTweet imagine hating yourself this much
how do I get that uncomfortable sweaty david duchovny look
.@davidduchovny why is ur author picture from 1995
@The_VolcanoBoy left
DAVID DUCHOVNYS AUTHOR PICTURE IS LIKE FROM THE 90S
I legitimately despise myself <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I literally feel like I don't deserve happiness because I'm ugly lol
when people try to relate to your self esteem issues and it's like no you don't understand
I used to be involved in stoner culture. I used to wear rasta. I am so ashamed.
I am the drug mom but I hate stoner culture
please don't forget this
@The_VolcanoBoy top and middle left r my favs
also when stoner dudes preach peace and then treat people like shit and steal your weed
@Lognee I didn't even see that good god
I hate when stoner dudes act like they know everything and are ""enlightened"" bc they did acid once
@Lognee wow all this time and that's all I had to do!? incredible
@EhJovan @riteaid buy one get one two
my mom googles "parakeet about to lay eggs" and porn came up
@jamiestonchus evan peters was in the episode of criminal minds that I just watched and am still crying abt
no show holds the power to make me blubber like a baby like criminal minds does tbh
@noiamnotawitch it's true tho that is the plural hahah
@noiamnotawitch thanks!
@J_Conlee thanks!
what is the plural of uterus
also: stop using uteruses and vaginas as symbols of feminism
"people with vaginas" "umm.. I think you mean girls" no I mean people with vaginas thx for ur input
why do people get so angry when you don't attach a gender when you're talking about genitals
@celestialkittyy HOLY FUCK
abolish traditional family values
now they're talking about "traditional family values" I want to jump out of this moving vehicle
@meme_princesa_ me too
@meme_princesa_ I think it was moody??
@meme_princesa_ I'm not sure one of my dad's Jesus stations but that segment is over now
"it's not genocide if it's gods will" - the radio right now I shit you not
ive cried about how much i love my dog on multiple occasions
@actuallyriles I can't breathe
can someone find me that video of Kanye comparing himself to vanellope Von schweetz
there's nothing wrong with being socially aware and calling people out on the problematic shit they say/do
I'd rather be a "sjw" than an insensitive offensive prick
hell yeah hotch FUCKED foyet UP
amy winehouse has calmed me and made me not scared anymore so im going to bed goodnight
those of you who saw me listening to bmth on spotify: it was for a joke snapchat video please dont judge me
someone hold my hand I am so scared
@noiamnotawitch every episode scares me because I am a tiny baby bird
foyet is the scariest serial killer on television
my mom told me not to stay up watching criminal minds because I would get too scared and she was right
@Lucas_Haupt good to hear!
@Lucas_Haupt :( stay warm friend
I was just trying to edit a photo why is this an option 
I wanna sm*ke w**d but I don't want to go outside :/
wishin I had Ativan
lol 
I constantly struggle with how uncomfortable texting makes me but also wanting to know how all my friends are doin :/
*is triggered by my phone*
when someone tries to guilt me into talking to them it makes me want to never talk to them again
the notion that you HAVE to be in CONSTANT communication with someone is 1) damaging and 2) creepy
@pagechels15 THAT KILLS ME EVERY TIME I WATCH IT GOD
@pam_spraybot all good homie
I hate everything about relationships besides sex and even then sex is just ok 4/10
@pam_spraybot what the fuck
I could probably be in a relationship if they never called me pet names or complimented me or touched me or talked to me
the team was the best when Emily prentiss was around
I don't have to do anything tomorrow so I'm probably going to stay up all hours of the night watching criminal minds
I love and miss my drug family &lt;/3
@wavegrave miss u too son ily
I will protect @KimKardashian to the death
@jamiestonchus that is so cute tbh
@celestialkittyy ily too <KISS>
@celestialkittyy incredible
@celestialkittyy I'm sure you'll make bank. u da best stripper ever<WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
I wanna date dr spencer reid
@celestialkittyy how is New Orleans???
I miss @celestialkittyy
@J_Conlee yeah
how do all of the antifeminist libertarians that I know all know each other
every time something emotional happens to Reid on criminal minds I cry so hard
what would I do if I actually found a serial killer behind the shower curtain
I'm too hungry to fall asleep but I'm too tired to get out of bed
not only is eminems music trash but he himself is trash
I'm gonna cry I love billy ray so much
when @billyraycyrus retweeted me I said "what to heck???" out loud
I can't believe this. dreams do come true
billy ray cyrus just retweeted me
HOLY SHIT @mooveitorloseit 
“@lolacarterx: @billyraycyrus at #Grammys2015 #GrammysRedCarpet 
I've been sad for so long that I'm not sure if these feelings are happiness.
I've been thinking and I'm the closest to happy that I've been in a long ass time and I might actually BE happy. I'm very content
@Aricin_Grey that makes so much sense
@Aricin_Grey I can't handle it what is GOING ON
what is iggy doing ever
@Aricin_Grey I am so confused tbh
@meme_princesa_ I don't even understand
I can't handle this 
@YUHB0Y she's also racist and doesn't think bisexual people exist
I hurt my ankle and I don't want to have to work tonight :(((
Clan
@bourgeois_bitch but mostly cause you like dick
MY DOG POOPED IN FRONT OF THE DOOR AND I STEPPED IN IT IN MY WORK SHOES WHAT THE FUCK
@celestialkittyy who cares what men think

#EMOBASEDGOD
@Goobertk wooooah
why have two people asked me for nudes tonight why is this happening to me why god why
don't have time for abuse apologists don't have time for rape apologists
@AdamxBevel preformed by Anne Hathaway in Ella enchanted and it knocks it up to top 5
@minalcrackers me too
whenever I'm out I just want to go home and watch the xfiles
@celestialkittyy for REAL
bars are a social experiment
drunk girls in a bathroom are the nicest demographic of people
do you ever see a person in a public setting and you're like idk how I know you but I'm pretty sure I hate you
@J_Conlee don't get me wrong it's cool if you have a beard or whatever but it doesn't make you a goddamn special snowflake to have one
I can't wait til I get paid and don't owe the entire thing to other people
I hate beard culture
how are dudes going to completely alienate women and treat us like were just vaginas and then expect us to suck their dicks
the episode of psych where Shawn catches mr yang is AMAZING
I can never watch the beginning of crime shows
@typicalnikki ME TOO it's so stressful
*sees 1994 david duchovny* just fuck me up
does anyone else get anxious about the speed their windshield wipers are going
@J_Conlee all people see from me is constant amy winehouse

But 
@wavegrave @lnperks @NotQuiteLuke I had 11  notifications
I injured my back putting on my coat :( I'm old
every character in psych is perfect
I fell asleep at my friends house and woke up to a concerned text from my mother at 6 am
god dammit this is horrible
my ex has my w2 :) which has my social in it :) I hate my life :)
@tim_sheridan dude I don't even know what was going on with me last night
last nights dreams are all flooding back to me and most of them are ridiculous
I also had a dream that I was at culvers and this girl started twerking on our windshield and I fought her
I also had a dream that I was at @tim_sheridan 's house and he told me that my coworker died and then we signed a football to remember her??
@J_Conlee I'll be sure to do that after I TAKE MASSIVE BONG RIPS AND EAT HUMAN FLESH
@J_Conlee as a pothead I can confirm this
@wavegrave god dammit cam livin the good life
@wavegrave yeah I prob would be too. I usually shoplift alone cause most of my friends don't do that shit it's LAME
my dog tried to jump on a chair and chickened out last minute and slid into the chair and hit her face.. what a loser
@wavegrave PLS god I don't shoplift often but one time I stole 3 expensive from jc penny cause they don't tag anything
@wavegrave i love it I love shoplifting I stole like 40 dollars worth of lipstick once
@wavegrave that's the worst and forever 21 sizes run small too
@wavegrave GOD that's honestly the est thing I've heard I love that u stole a wallet chain on Xanax I'm gonna tell my kids this story
@wavegrave ya support sad xfiles bookshops
this is my life now 
@wavegrave did you pay for it or lift it
@wavegrave HOW DID I NOT SEE THT
I had a dream that someone mailed me weed
@wavegrave u also own a wallet chain
@wavegrave @meme_princesa_ this makes me so happy
I said "bagels" like 6 times in one minute
spending my day off learning about shaqs business empire
"I just want to learn more about shaq" -something I just said
I love that some homeschool mom is running the @shawnspencer twitter
@wavegrave that twitter is truly a gem
shoveled my driveway for work, can't get out of driveway because of BLOCK OF ICE, shoveled for nothing
shoveling snow is the worst thing that's ever happened to me
@wavegrave @shawnspencer I'm laughing so hard at that twitter
@wavegrave but they order stuff online!
@wavegrave GOD SAME
@noiamnotawitch oh my god ily
I want Shawn spencer to punch  me in the face
I wish netflix would play
what if the halftime show was just david duchovny looking lost scared and sweaty
told u they wouldn't win. I'm their goodluck charm
@velvetgrunge oh my god I can't remember he was just talking about how greatness is in his code or whatever
I think my favorite thing in the world is that Kanye compared himself to vanellope von schweetz
literally can't get my car in the driveway
I wanna do something but I also don't wanna die u see my problem
I don't understand how people make enough money to like.. buy clothes..
I opened happy jacks and now we're closing happy jacks. funny how life works
I hate nighttime because it reminds me how lonely I am
WHY DO I MISS SOMEONE WHO TREATED ME LIKE COMPLETE SHIT ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS
@fefifohannah im in hell
@fefifohannah YOU CANT GET THE TASTE OUT OF YOUR MOUTH FOR HOURS
@MirandaNewbyy i love that lighter so much :')
@MirandaNewbyy AH YES I DO THIS IS EXCELLENT NEWS
@monotonewitch feelin this
i just threw up my medication is what im trying to say
one of the reasons i dont like taking my medicine is i throw up all the time and throwing up is 1000x worse after youve taken pills
i hope we get so much snow that i dont have to work tomorrow
no one will ever make music as well as amy winehouse
"I like wine because Jesus liked wine" "is that why you like vodka too?"
I came home high af and my mom made me grilled cheese and tomato soup
@MirandaNewbyy das how we do it
@wavegrave PROBABLY WHO KNOWS
