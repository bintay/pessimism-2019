When something ends it simply means it just wasn't meant to continue, let it go.
You have to learn that certain people will remain in your heart, but not in your life..
Life is to short to have regrets so forgive, forget, move on and let go.

Both are powerless without your reaction.
Our lives are like a book, each day is a new page that we get to color in between the lines with whatever crayons we choose.
Smile, even if it's fake. Laugh, even if you hurt. Don't let anyone get to you, you're beautiful regardless of what anyone says to you.
