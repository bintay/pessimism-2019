your friend can easily forget about it in a day or two but what about the victim? :/
who is the one that is being victimised? who is the one that would get scarred ... for a while ... forever?
if you're that scared that they'd get punished by the school and shit, think about the victim of bullying.
if you hesitated, the answer is simple: educate your friend
if a close friend bullied someone, would you call him/her out or would you shut up?
ppl underestimate bullying so much ...
is there like a hair solution to make it grow bc some of my strands are cut off bc of the metal rims on my glasses smh
i want to go to the cinemas alone <TIRED FACE> but im broke af!
THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND IS NOT GETTING THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES

coercion =/= consent

the absence of "no" =/= consent

consent is activ…
I CANT SUPPORT A MOVEMENT ENOUGH

ignore my stupid poems
we ignore the spectrum,
we ignore the human race.
can we really not see 
or are our minds too 
afraid to tell the truth?
our eyes see 
but can our lips say what
the heart wants to?
we leave marks 
but we don't leave
what we never have enough of.
is there any
thing that isn't 
dry like your 
eyes and lips?
do we reply to random people
time is not 
something you 
have enough 
of.
i literally have no idea what this is supposed to mean
our hearts sink
my lips blue
we cant think
i have no clue
if you need to know anything about the amazing spider-man, just ask me. im a confident nerd.

everyone, listen to 'stockholm syndrome' and 'illusion' !!
hey, let's start a band !!
19 days to 2015? complete bullshit.
yes. apparently, i do ship a sensei and a student. just a few years of age difference but it was a time-travel au fic sooooooo
was the title 'shadows of the past'? well, whatever. kakashi lost his memory and before that, he and sakura had a little argument. *cries*
baby, look what you've done to me. baby, look what you've done now.
i can be a little bit sadistic at times .. the 'pleasure' in seeing my otp getting heartbroken and all
so tell me you believe in love, it's not an illusion to me <HEADPHONE>
smh @ all of you. pathetic.
dah kalah, kalah. dah menang, menang.
read kakashi and sakura almost doing the frick frack, but the author didn't type it all out ..
re-reading 'flaming heart', by far the best kakasaku time-travel fic ever
stick to your ugly ass phone
why must i share the same interests as you
went to the supermarket and the song they were playing was so annoying that i had to whip out my ipod and play some tunes
it's not a song btw lmao
your feet - pablo neruda
but I love your feet 
only because they walked 
upon the earth and upon 
the wind and upon the waters, 
until they found me
it's on, you dumb ass bitch
also means, who the fuck cares how many fucks i wrote in a post, the important thing is that you guys are bullying someone in the internet
recalling the time when i called out on certain bullies on facebook and the first thing they noticed was how many 'fuck''s i typed out smh
the uchiha brothers 
that wasn't very cash money of you
watching some tv dramas while waiting for ostko to update
“@zaynmalik: I love you x” thanks
eating cream buns at 1AM
wow there are actually people like that in this world
@jingxuan19 and my thoughts are always right
my cat is the best when she's asleep lmao she'd kill me when she wakes up adios
literally my cousin's baby hates me, he cries whenever i reach my hands out to him lmao
my cat is too cute
re-watching my all time favourite korean drama ..... yes, i'm into that too
i just woke up but still tired lmao
i was just kidding about the last part. all i need is some good fanfiction and a video of my favourite person, thanks &lt;3
the hannah montana side of me wants to slap someone while the miley stewart side just wants a shoulder to cry on
even the worst memories, they're hard to let go of
and this, ladies &amp; gentlemen, is the reason why i'd rather stay alone and do stuff that actually makes me happy than sit and cry about stuff
just thinking about stupid childhood because i can't watch any videos that actually make me happy
my nose is blocked and my throat hurts hella bad
my childhood was so bad, i'd hate myself even more when i think about it
if you ever feel sad, just remember: my whole family forgot my birthday this one time.
my worst memories mostly happened when i was in school :/// coincidence? nah.
im not sure if it was the first day but it was in the first week. in the toilet, while i was changing to my sports attire. pathetic, i know.
tweeting shit to 104 people. hi, guys. please bear with me.
confession: i cried on the first day of school (2013) because i thought i wasn't gonna make any friends and i'm super awkward
and i heard of everyone's first impression of me and they were all similar. i look intimidating and shit. i was upset obviously.
i lost my first friend to a group of girls and she started avoiding me. i ate waffles alone everyday, those waffles were my friends.
thinking of my years in primary school, it was a living hell.
i cry a lot when im alone tbh, especially late at night
is typing out the vowels too much of a burden?
my puns are getting better. i think.
i'm testing how far i can go without sleep
i'll only watch the team 7 parts in the last movie, not a fan of romance in a fucking shounen manga
i probably look like i'm half-dead
im still awake tf
well, whatever. i'm continuing to just watch korean variety shows and stuff.
i don't hate hinata but this is just absolutely ridiculous. the side character's feelings are apparently more important than the main's smh
THIS IS WHY I HATE SEEING ROMANCE IN AN ACTION FILM/STORY, IT'S SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON THE PROTAGONIST, NOT THE FUCKING LOVE INTEREST
'a new relationship', my ass. becoming strangers and focusing on a one-sided romance that didn't even contribute to the real story.
naruto: the last is so nonsensical soz i heard kakashi and sasuke only had a few minutes of screen time then that's it, hinata hinata hinata
i think i can last about another 5 hours and then, that's it. sleepy time for me.
not sleeping anytime soon, i'm probably half-zombie already
nightlife = watching movies at night, under the blanket and consuming unhealthy food and beverages
hey, it's 7.18AM and i'm still not asleep yet.
well, since no one seems online at the moment, i'll gladly spend my time on tumblr (you know, searching up the tags)
saw me in public? yes. now, turn around and move straight. that's not me, i'm never out.
@Ashton5SOS the hair. the hair. just, the hair. LOVE IT.
a reminder: no one gives a fuck, do what you want (i meant, only if it's legal d-uuh)
second-guessing life
but since i don't really care about being thoughtful, i'm gonna take it out anyway
there is a pokka peach tea in the freezer waiting to be taken out but apparently, since im smart enough to think, it'll keep me more awake
'we meet again' to being the only one on my timeline
some of the world's greatest legends were murdered. the question is, why?
to say that they almost made love is a bit surprising, they're only 17 and a little bit lacking in the mature department
will kyouya and erika break up? hope yes, so i can witness some heartbroken kyouya since all we've seen is of erika.
waiting for the next chapter of my favorite manga to release can be a lil' bit annoying
your username doesn't matter but your tweets do
@sshsharon but you did agree to it though, that's all that matters.
@sshsharon hahahah just a thought
@sshsharon i've always wanted to see how the drinking life goes, as in not to me but someone else
@sshsharon surfing the internet at night is kind of like clubbing. exhilarating &amp; you'd get like a hangover in the morning, if you woke up.
@sshsharon too bad not all dreams come true sigh ://
i will wake up at 2PM whether you like it or not
@sshsharon ikr school would be better if we don't need to get off our asses in the damn morning
@sshsharon similar situation. school is such a drag tho, i'd rather have afternoon classes sigh
don't trust anyone that sleeps before midnight
it feels like it's 9PM
@sshsharon welcome to the club! i don't think i know the time anymore.
i will automatically like you if you're the type to sleep late, depends on what i consider late though
@sshsharon they're no fun
if i was famous,-- yeah, right
that was my cat
it's turning 4AM. why are you guys asleep? wake up and have fun, eat snacks and watch movies!
it's no fun when no one i follow is tweeting late night stuff except me, you know, the usual teen angst and drama
guys who can't accept it when their girls don't want them anymore, and share it to the whole world about how a bitch she is smh
I SLEPT EARLY THEN WOKE UP BC I WAS DREAMING OF THIS LOVE TRIANGLE TF
i found some jay chou stickers (you know, the guy from the green hornet)
smh @ all of you
annoying af, that's what you are
stop shouting and do whatever you want in my damn house lmao educate yourself
i hate my cousins and especially this bitch who thinks she's better than everyone lmao you shout at your parents every fucking second
wow you're older so your opinions matter more? that was so mature.
my mum doesn't understand that i don't want to go out with this fucking bitch-ass relatives but not bc im lazy lol
fucking cousins can be so fucking annoying lmao i can have my own damn opinions
bitch shut the fuck up
talking about muscles, i'm constantly reminded of hot guys in anime with great abs.
carrying children can be a bit of a workout
well, i hope no one saw that. good afternoon.
doesn't it feel like i'm just an intelligent cat talking? (not saying that i'm intelligent but the fact that a cat talking is smart)
talking about sleeping, i'm feeling rather tired. advanced goodnight in case i decide to continue doing the only thing i'm good at.
so it would be better if could sleep forever and never wake up.
because i have no talents besides sleeping.
well, i'm good at sleeping which kind of explains why i wake up not being able to do anything else.
i'm tired of waking up and not being able to do the things i'm good at. i have no talents, that is all.
congrats, @edsheeran . you worked hard and for that, thank you.
but i still believe that everyone can have opinions. (but don't say it out loud if it's offensive for fuck's sake)
sincere apologies for those stupid tweets back in the days when i was an immature brat (maybe i still am but im trying, honest)
maybe since a cat is a mammal, its anatomy shouldn't be that different from a human's
wait. belly?
okay, let's appreciate the white fur spot on my cat's belly (icon picture)
somehow feel uncomfortable with this icon
give me pokka tea (as long as it's not green tea or blueberry, i wouldn't mind but the tongue wants what it wants)
living the 'impossible bc i'm lazy' life
also, haru and sarang-chan are my favorites. i think.
sorry for the times i've made you uncomfortable and also in advance, in case we'll be classmates lmao (i can't help that im awkward)
i slept in the afternoon so im pretty much gonna be awake all night
800+ notes aka fuck yeah
unless the lyrics mean shit
never a trust someone who never gets his/her earpieces in a tangled mess
the nose ruins it all, doesn't it
it was worth a shot
HEY THIS ISNT HALF BAD IM PROUD LMAO
thinking of the future,

expectation: career, studies 
reality: when my fav band member becomes a daddy
k-pop isn't even that bad tbh, i admit. and besides, there's nothing wrong with listening to a 'bubblegum pop' boyband.
lmao stop looking down on a certain music genre and think "i listen to this so i know music better than you do!!!!!"
love yourself
TO BE LOVED AND TO BE IN LOVE
i have loved you since we were 18
those hair on your skin are to detect if something is on you which explains the reason why i feel so touCHED ALL THE TIME
i can't close my eyes without picturing gory scenes in my head
can't seem to breathe right when i think about school
without my close friends, i'm always the last chosen in everything (even another close friend probably likes me the least)
i have a feeling i wont make NEW friends next year and everyone will probably hate me .. again
i have the worst memory
but is it scientifically proven that wearing glasses makes your eyes smaller
and then there's stupid school in less than a month .... lay down on the shit yo
was supposed to get the ascott hotel like right in front of the twin towers but the stupid management, their rules and shit
stupid, male young adult singers, with their cute smiles and those voices. damn it ://
his outfits in the mv makes him look 2x hotter, if that's even possible. but the beat of the song makes everything better. fav mv from him!
my fingers are so long tf
previous rt lmao
hi, im 1d af
that's okay. benedict cumberbatch as stephen strange.
apparently, the books are supposed to be collected at a certain date. hence, fuck yeah
can i touch your stubble and ask if you're real
age: 35, still calls my mum to fetch my child from school bc fml that's why
................... ........... ................. ......... .............. .................... ........ ............
THERES A MISTAKE IN THE TWEET FML

silently waiting for my mum to call so i can get ready at meet her at school smh why cant we just go together

gender equality. please.
go back to sleep, shit happens
you called out on erika being dumb for listening to kyouya but you never call HIM out when he was being rude and mean to her. lmao, tough.
how did these kids come up with such great tweets
the guy that has a crush on erika is so cute though (and very goofy :D)
honestly, i wouldnt be surprised if kyouya and erika breaks up next chapter. they've got a lot of shit to resolve
the question is; why am i awake at this timing?
aya-chan is coming to town<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> (as in he's coming next chapter hyfr)
asakura is so oblivious sometimes 
stupid pimple
fuCKING BITCH IM GONNA END YOU
