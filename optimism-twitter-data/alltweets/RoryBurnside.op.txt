CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Cranbourne/Pakenham line after an earlier @VictoriaPolice request at Dandenong. #metrotrains
@mattys123 Has Ramsay's status been changed from Red? If so, has it changed to Amber or Green?
@mattys123 Remember, Red status means a player won't play, Amber status means he may or may not play and Green status means he will play.
@mattys123 I believe his injury status has gone from Red to Amber and now Green.
@mattys123 Which hip did Paul Seedsman hurt in the win over the FILTH?
@andrewgigacz Lol that's a good one!
@networkrail @nationalrailenq That was quick.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on Citylink after an earlier diesle spill at Racecourse Road. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
CODE ORANGE ALERT: @VictoriaPolice have given clearance at Dandenong and trains are moving, but with delays up to 30 minutes. #metrotrains
@metrotrains That took quite a significant amount of time and as a consequence has caused excessive congestion.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Delays up to 25 minutes on the Cranbourne/Pakenham line due to a @VictoriaPolice request at Dandenong. #metrotrains
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Delays up to 15 minutes on the Cranbourne/Pakenham line due to a @VictoriaPolice request at Dandenong. #metrotrains
@networkrail @nationalrailenq What are the animals that are on the line?
@mattys123 Paul Seedsman's Red injury status has changed. Can we change it to Green now or leave it at Amber for the moment?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: There are delays of up to 20 minutes outbound on Citylink at Racecourse Road due to an earlier diesle spill. #melbtraffic
@translinkseq As a result of the delays reducing, it's been downgraded from a red circle to an orange triangle.
@afl_benguthrie @collingwoodfc I think 10am is a good time. Right balance between getting it over &amp; done with &amp; not being excessively early.
@afl_benguthrie What time are the two sessions tomorrow and Friday?
@travking_afl What days do the Hawks have team training sessions when they play on a Saturday?
@AFL_BenGuthrie Hi there! I'm a Pies fan. What days do the Pies have team training sessions when they play on a Sunday? Thank you.
@travking_afl I'm a Pies fan. What days do the Pies have team training sessions if they're playing on a Sunday?
@travking_afl I think most clubs train around that time.
@melbournefc @gomvfc Ah okay. Now it makes sense. Thank you.
@gomvfc @melbournefc That is, how can two clubs train at the same time at the same ground?
@gomvfc Apparently you're training at 10am on Thursday at Goshes Paddock, at the same time as @melbournefc. How can that work?
@travking_afl What time is Thursday training?
@citylinkmelb @gettrafficvic That was quick. It was only closed for 8 minutes.
I reckon I've reported at least 100 promo tweets as spam but they keep coming. It's really starting to piss me off.
@melbtraffic Better than being closed.
@MelbTraffic Grimshaw Street was closed eastbound at Greensborough Road for 15 minutes due to an accident, but has now reopened.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Grimshaw St was closed eastbound at Greensborough Rd for 15 minutes due to an accident, but has now reopened. #melbtraffic
@vicroads It's just reopened in the last 90 seconds. Thanks.
@dysongroup That didn't take long. Only 15 minutes.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Despite the weather, the roads and the trains are currently all clear. Updates if this changes. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@cricketaus Okay thanks.
CODE PINK ALERT: Things will be screwed this PM due to howling gales. Fallen trees will close roads &amp; train lines. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@cricketaus It seems to be taking longer than usual. Or are dates usually announced around May or June?
@CricketAus Hi. When will the dates be announced for next summer's home tests V New Zealand and the West Indies? Thanks.
@iamtheoracle When are the dates announced for the international cricket season in Australia?
@mattys123 What colour do you think the skin around his thumb would have gone when he broke it?
INJURY UPDATE: Paul Seedsman (hip) - Amber status changed to Green. He will play against Richmond on Sunday. #gopies
@mattys123 So in that sense, a broken thumb is better than a leg injury because he's still able to run and keep his general fitness up.
@mattys123 I know. Annoying. I think you're right about him coming straight back in. If he had a leg injury, they'd prob take the VFL route.
@mattys123 A good result in the sense that it's at the low end of the estimated time frame. Sorry for separate tweets, I ran out of room.
@mattys123 Well, his chances of an early return may be gone, but at least he hasn't had a complication. Gold Coast would be a good result.
@mattys123 Do you think it's more likely they'll wait for North Melbourne or that they'll take him up to Queensland?
@mattys123 Still hoping he'll make the trip up north. I guess we'll find out more in the next 7 days.
@mattys123 I know that sounds pesimistic, but I've got a sinking feeling that's the way it's going. Hope I'm wrong though.
@mattys123 In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he spent a week in VFL, so there's a chance we may not see him again until Queen's Birthday.
@mattys123 His thumb doesn't seem to be healing as quickly as they'd hoped. Now starting to think it'll be the full 8 weeks, not just 6.
@mattys123 Hoping Steele will make the trip to Queensland Saturday week but starting to get that sinking feeling it might drag out longer.
Oh barf. Piss off.
@yarratrams That took a heck of a long time.
@mitchellglenn It frustrates me that it may take up to 6 months to get a result. Way too long.
@mitchellglenn I think it's common sense that the players have been given the green light to continue playing in the interim.
one person followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@mattys123 Open training this week is tomorrow at 10am. What will Bucks's two boys be doing at that time?
@PAFC Just noticed your site has info on open training for the next two weeks. Thanks for acknowledging my feedback after last week.
MRP UPDATE: All players - Green status. No charges laid from Friday night's game. #gopies
INJURY UPDATE: Paul Seedsman (hip) and Jackson Ramsay (leg) - Red status changed to Amber. Both players a good chance for Sunday. #gopies
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. An RDO means lighter than usual volumes. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@themightypies I have a new traffic light system for injury and MRP status. Please see earlier tweet for full info.
@magpie_fans I'll be using a traffic light system for players' injury and MRP status. Please see my previous tweet for full info.
Attention Collingwood fans: I will now have regular updates on players' injury and MRP status. These updates (cont) 
. @CollingwoodFC Round 6 report - Injury status: Green (no new injuries). MRP status: Green (no charges laid). #gopies
@craigsta9010 @dayna_36 Play angry, but play fair.
@craigsta9010 @dayna_36 Go hard, but not so hard as to run the risk of being suspended. We certainly don't want suspensions.
Big blow for @Adelaide_FC with star midfielder Rory Sloane likely to be out until after the June bye with a broken cheekbone. Ouch!
@adelaide_fc Ouch! Worst possible result.
@neroli_m_fox @foxsportsnews Ouch! Worst possible result.
CODE GREEN ALERT: There was an ill passenger at Southern Cross, but was quickly treated and had no impact on services. #metrotrains
@nationalrailenq And that leaves you with a full set of green ticks on your service indicator!
I'm backing @sp_10 to go his whole career without getting reported. Such a fair player, always cool in the crisis. #gopies
@craigsta9010 @dayna_36 I'm backing Pendles to go his whole career without getting reported.
@dayna_36 @craigsta9010 Like the way Hawthorn played against North Melbourne (sans the suspensions).
@dayna_36 @craigsta9010 I want to see us play angry on Sunday (legally, of course). Don't want anyone getting suspended.
@johnko71 @faustus_socinus Yeah. I think the yellow cards will be flowing.
@johnko71 @faustus_socinus Do you think there'll be a few yellow cards on Sunday?
@paullatter Good to see you back after your leave. Hope you're doing well.
@faustus_socinus @johnko71 I think we might be the only team this year not to have had a red card. Yellows aplenty though.
@pafc Hi. Please confirm this week's open training session early in the week. Last week's wasn't confirmed until Friday. Very short notice.
@johnko71 @faustus_socinus If it's over in 90 minutes, both games will finish at the same time. But not if it goes to extra time/penalties.
@johnko71 @faustus_socinus What time does the ALeague final start?
@collingwoodfc 2/2 because I think it would create a better atmosphere for fans due to it being close to game day. Thanks.
@CollingwoodFC Hi. I wish to suggest you also hold an open training session on Saturday as well as the one already set down for tomorrow 1/2
Attention @CollingwoodFC fans - Open training this week is tomorrow at 10am at Olympic Park Oval. It's a 2 hour session. #gopies
@mattys123 So your printer only has one light, but that light has four colours.
@translinkseq But in this case, it's an orange triangle as services are only delayed, not suspended.
@mattys123 Does the printer click or beep when it's warmed up and ready to go or is it just the light going from blue to green?
@mattys123 Also, most cats have green eyes, but when they're little baby kittens, they're blue. Like the printer. First blue, then green.
@mattys123 But if you mix their two colours together, you'd get the ready light.
@mattys123 Which AFL club would be the same shade of blue as the startup light?
@mattys123 So the startup colour is cold, the ready colour is cool, the pause/sleep mode colour is warm and the error colour is hot.
@mattys123 I guess blue on startup makes sense because it means the printer is cold and needs to warm up. Blue is a cold colour.
@mattys123 A red light when you've got something very important to print out with a pressing deadline is code red stresfull.
@mattys123 Glad you've just been getting blue and green with very occasional orange and no red.
@mattys123 So blue when warming up, green when fully powered on, orange when paused or in sleep mode and red when there's an error.
@mattys123 Does it go blue when processing or shutting off or only when warming up?
@mattys123 Which AFL club would be the same shade of blue as the warming up light?
@mattys123 Did the light go red or orange last time you printed something or just blue and green?
@mattys123 On some printers, solid red is major error, like hardware failure &amp; blinking red is minor error, like paper jam or out of paper.
@mattys123 Do any of the colours blink? If so, which one, and what does the blinking mean? Or are they all solid?
@mattys123 So it's blue for powering up, green for ready/printing, orange for sleep mode and red for an error, correct?
@themightypies But our VFL side had a good win last night, and most importantly, no new injuries.
@mattys123 Or standby. When you turn the printer on, does the light go first orange then green or directly to green?
@mattys123 What if it goes orange? Or is orange okay?
@craigsta9010 @dayna_36 Just needs 1-2 weeks of full training. A setback would be if his return was delayed beyond Round 9.
@dayna_36 @craigsta9010 Steele won't play next Sunday, but that's not a setback as such. He's basically right on schedule.
@mattys123 If the light on your printer goes red on you, do you say "Oh fruit!" or stronger?
@mattys123 What about the Tigers? Oh wait, they're yellow. The standby light on your printer is orange. Like the Giants.
@dayna_36 @craigsta9010 For the first time this year, both our senior side and our VFL side escaped unscathed. No new injuries to report.
@mattys123 When do the Pies next play a team with one of the three light colours on your printer?
@translinkseq As trains were not officially declared suspended, it remained as an orange triangle and thankfully didn't become a red circle.
@davis_harr Especially if Kohli and/or De Villiers are still there in the 20th over. They could go absolutely nutso.
@translinkseq Whenever services are suspended, it's an automatic red circle regardless of the length of the associated delay.
@translinkseq It's currently an orange triangle, but if trains are suspended, it will become a red circle.
@harrypotter6116 Also, Port Adelaide are 17 points up on West Coast at half time. If Port win, I believe we'll stay in second spot.
@harrypotter6116 But it makes me feel better about Friday night. And our VFL team had a good win last night.
For the first time this year, @CollingwoodFC has managed to get through a weekend without any new injuries! Long may it continue. #gopies
Next Sunday marks three  years since 
A very happy Mother's Day to my wonderful mother @DebinMelbourne. See you later today.
CODE GREEN ALERT: There are currently no incidents to report on our roads or our rail network. All clear. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@glendora_pd What was the alert level during the storm?
@mattys123 The future looks bright for both the VFL side and the senior side.
@mattys123 Great effort from our VFL side to come from behind &amp; then hold on for the last 10 mins when Geelong were doing all the attacking.
@mattys123 What about that poor Geelong guy who fell and ruptured his family jewels! Ouch!
@mattys123 A broken thumb is better than a leg injury in the sense that it doesn't stop you from running.
@mattys123 And for once, a medium/long term injury is healing right on schedule with no setbacks along the way.
@mattys123 Steele not playing next Sunday isn't a setback. He's basically right on schedule. A setback would be anything later than Round 9.
@mattys123 And when I say no new injuries, I mean no new injuries in either the seniors game or the VFL game!
@mattys123 The Pies' VFL side beat Geelong earlier this evening after coming from 19 points down at half time. And no new injuries!
@vflpies Lol that's a good one!
@themightypies @mattys123 @vflpies I'm vision impaired. Is Richmond's yellow the same shade of yellow as a cab?
@thedak04 @mattys123 Agreed. Finals would be satisfactory. Anything more would be a bonus.
@mattys123 Is the standby light on your printer a Richmond yellow or is there too much orange in that and it's more like the Giants?
@mattys123 And given the way Richmond played today, that bodes well for next Sunday.
@mattys123 I'm prepared to put last night to one side. Just a blip on the radar. If we can get to the bye 9 and 2, we're looking good.
@mattys123 So last night may not prove quite so costly after all.
@mattys123 Would be somewhat fitting if Steele's return game was in the same state where he broke his thumb.
@Magpie_Fans Hearing Steele's been ruled out of next Sunday's game, but it's not a setback as such. He's pretty much right on schedule.
@mattys123 A "setback" would be if his return was delayed until after the bye. He's pretty much right on schedule.
@vflpies Bad end to that quarter. Need to regroup after the break or the game will get away like it did for the senior side last night.
@mattys123 The initial estimate was Round 10, so Round 8 is actually two weeks early. That's why I'm not treating it as a delay/setback.
@mattys123 I always thought Steele would need two weeks of solid training. I'm not treating it like he's had a complication.
@vflpies It feels like the Cats have all the momentum. We need to hold on and not let them get away.
@mattys123 Okay. At least he hasn't suffered any complications.
@mattys123 Were his x-ray results bad or is it just because they want to give him two weeks of ball work?
@mattys123 Rats! It's been pushed back. Bad x-ray results?
@mattys123 Will we find out on Monday if Steele will play against Richmond or will we have to wait until teams come out on Thursday?
3 people followed me and 6 people unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@harrypotter6116 And now we're starting to cave in. This could still be a 10 goal loss. That would be catastrophic.
Ouch, ouch and ouch! 3 quick goals and the deficit blows out to 41 points. So much for saving percentage. Could still be a 10 goal loss.
Ouch! Pies turn it over and it costs them a goal and in all likelyhood costs them the game. Good fightback, but were never going to win.
Jesse White! He marks and unloads a long bomb! Deficit back to 23! Pies not done with yet! #gopies
Scoring has dried up and it's becoming a bit of an arm wrestle. Not what the Pies need. They need goals. &amp;  quick. Time running out. #gopies
Rats! Cloke misses an easy shot and now the ball is at the wrong end of the ground. Deficit 29 and time starting to run out. #gopies
@collingwoodfc Now we need to lock the ball in our forward line and create another chance. Without taking too much time off the clock.
Have @CollingwoodFC left their run too late? Regardless, I've been impressed with the way they've fought back in the second half. #gopies
@themightypies The lead peaked at 60 points just before half time. Even if we go down, we have to at least try and save our percentage.
@jletti @etihadstadiumau @melbournecity Seems we're a little late getting underway, unless I had the kickoff time wrong.
@gomvfc Seems we're a little late getting underway here.
@collingwoodfc @patrickkarnezis And hopefully no red vests either! #gopies
@vicroads Also, why does the number on a speed limit sign have a red circle around it?
@vicroads So whenever the lights go faulty, the whole lot flashes orange.
Slow loading webpages make me want to slit my wrists.
Broomhead is the sub tonight. He's too good a player to be the sub. The stupid sub rule makes me wanna slit my wrists.
@iamtheoracle @vicroads I'm vision impaired. If traffic lights are flashing orange, does the arrow flash orange as well?
@nationalrailenq So the original estimate of 08:00 was right after all!
@melbtraffic @etihadstadiumau @mcg Or catch public transport. @metrotrains is looking good this afternoon.
@The_Rail_Life Stony Point aside, our rail network is looking good this afternoon. Nothing like the disruptions that occurred on Wednesday.
@metrotrains Looking pretty good across the rail network for the Friday afternoon peak. Nothing like those disruptions you had on Wednesday.
@melbtraffic If delays are bad now, I shudder to think how bad they'd be if running lanes were blocked.
@metrotrains I've had the Metro Notify app for three months now, &amp; let me tell you, it's working a treat! Disruption info hot off the press!
@melbtraffic At least it's not blocking any running lanes.
CODE GREEN ALERT: There was a minor police incident at Hoppers Crossing on the Werribee line, but this has now cleared. #metrotrains
@citylinkmelb @gettrafficvic @melair What happened?
@vline_geelong Was it a trespasser on the tracks or an ill behaved passenger?
@metrotrains Hearing of a @VictoriaPolice request at Hoppers Crossing. I hope it's not another bomb scare like what happened last month.
@vline_geelong I believe this is due to a police operation at Hoppers Crossing. I hope it's not another bomb scare like last month.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Traffic on the Western Ring Rd was being disrupted by police at Widford Rd overpass, but it's now cleared. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic @etihadstadiumau @mcg Correction: It's #AFLPiesVCats.
@melbtraffic You guys were offline during this morning's peak. Every now and then you drop offline without warning during a peak period.
@PAFC I noticed your site wasn't updated with tomorrow's open training session until today. Please update open training earlier in future.
So much for the mass exodus at @CollingwoodFC. Tom Langdon has re-signed for 3 more years following the re-signing of @elliott_jw on Monday.
Ew. Tomato ice cream. Barf city. #masterchef
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@CChristGarcia Hi there! Nice to meet you! How did you come across me?
OFFICIAL: Tim Broomhead, who was ill, has been given the medical green light and is available for tomorrow's game against Geelong. #gopies
Works affecting several lines this weekend. Please see below for full info. 
@the_rail_life I'm thinking a similar length to the Bairnsdale line in 2013. That was 7 months.
@the_rail_life Will the fact that we're going into winter slow things down or will that not make a difference?
@the_rail_life I'm thinking much later in the year, maybe even as late as Christmas. I know that sounds pesimistic, but that's how it feels.
@the_rail_life I fear my mother could have her birthday on June 17th before it returns. I meant Frankston, Werribee and Williamstown.
@The_Rail_Life All three lines that were previously closed have now reopened.
@yarratrams That was quick.
Melbournians, if you have an iPhone, I recommend you download the #victraffic and #MetroNotify apps. Very helpful for your daily commute.
@vicroads Is the Traffic Alert icon on the Vic Traffic website the same colours as the Richmond Football Club?
@melbtraffic @9newsmelb What's going on? Do people have a hot date or something? #ImpatientDrivers
@vline_geelong That was quick. I'd feared that it may continue through the night. The damage must have been only minor.
@metrotrains That was fixed a lot quicker than I expected. The damage must have been only minor.
@metrotrains The @PTV_Official site says delays up to 20 minutes on the Frankston line. Is that the length of the current delays?
@vline_geelong A fire is the culprit. I'd say there's a good chance trains may not run again until the morning.
@The_Rail_Life Which of the two major disruptions on our rail network will be resolved first? The one at Edithvale or the one at Seddon?
@metrotrains Do you think the issue at Edithvale or the one at Seddon will be fixed first?
My phone wouldn't call or send texts so I turned it off and back on again and poof! Problem solved! When in doubt, always reboot.
@craigsta9010 Well it's only early May, so you might just have to harden up! #joke
@metrotrains Would it be an option to catch a Williamstown train to Newport &amp; change there for a Werribee train to avoid replacement buses?
@mattys123 Having said that, I think he can be covered, so it's definitely not a code red situation.
@mattys123 There's one more training session at 10:30am tomorrow. I'm hopeful, but not optimistic. I'd say he's in big trouble.
@mattys123 Do you think he's in more trouble than Swan last week or about equal?
@metrotrains Uh oh. I've got a bad feeling the line may have to close outright. I certainly hope not. Would be the worst time for that.
@melbtraffic Why does the number on a speed limit sign have a red circle around it?
@mattys123 What chance, in percentage terms, would you rate Seedsman of missing Friday night?
@metrotrains Hi Metro, how much extra travel time will the replacement buses on the Frankston line increase journeys by?
@metrotrains @robotsexbot I'd say 7pm would be the earliest you could expect to fix the damage, and even that might be a struggle.

@dayna_36 @mattys123 So for this week, main session (closed) today, rest day tomorrow, then final session (open) Thursday, correct?
@nationalrailenq Disruption had been expected to continue until the end of service. Good to see it's cleared early.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 Do you think closed sessions are held at or around the same time as open ones?
@dayna_36 @mattys123 I felt 9am was a just a shade early, particularly for fans who live further away. 10am or 10:30am is much better.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 Yes. Suggested they have open training at the end of the week and at 10am instead of 9am, which they've done.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 2/2 session early in the week and I felt that was too big a gap between the open session and the game.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 I like that. It creates a good atmosphere for fans due to it being close to game day. Last year they had their open 1/2
@dayna_36 @mattys123 As we play Friday night this week, our open training session is Thursday at 10:30am.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 Often if you play Saturday you have a heavy session on the Wednesday and then a final lighter session on the Friday.
@mattys123 Most clubs have their open training sessions anywhere between 9am and 11am.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 What day of the week is their main session?
@mattys123 So why do AFL clubs train during the day?
@mattys123 Does the Pies' VFL side train on the same day and at the same time each week as the senior side or at different times?
@_ria84 @paigecardona I suspect we would have lost by 80 points if that game had been last year. We're 4 for 5 in final quarters this year.
@_ria84 @paigecardona If we had have rolled over and lost that game by 80 points, our percentage would be significantly lower.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail gave the green light quicker than expected following those safety checks.
@_ria84 @paigecardona Limiting the damage in the Crows game is one of the reasons why our percentage is sitting at a healthy 147.
@_ria84 @paigecardona I'm glad we fought it out against the Crows and didn't roll over and lose by 80 points. That's where we've improved.
@mattys123 @collingwoodfc Does the VFL side train on the same days and at the same times each week as the seniors or at different times?
@_ria84 @paigecardona But we only lost that game by 29 points.
@vicroads @melbtraffic I hope it doesn't have to change to a red circle with a white line through it. That would not be good.
@_ria84 @paigecardona I missed that game as I was away in the US visiting my dad and his family.
@vicroads @melbtraffic I believe it's showing on the site as a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, correct?
@paigecardona What game was that in?
@vicroads Correction: It's two right lanes that are closed, not two left lanes.
@melbtraffic The Vic Traffic website is reporting it as two left lanes. I guess that's an error.
@melbtraffic @9newsmelb @theheraldsun Correction: It's two left lanes that are closed.
@davis_harr That's the risk you take with the new system. If you challenge &amp; it doesn't come off, you're looking at an automatic extra week.
@mattys123 I reckon Hodge will get 4 weeks. His hit was worse than Yarren's.
@mattys123 That's the risk you take when you challenge a suspension under the new system. Always an extra week if it doesn't come off.
If one more stupid promo tweet appears on my timeline I'm going to slit my wrists.

Oh barf. Shut up.
@westcoasteagles Ah ok. That makes more sense. Hope he's ok &amp; he didn't have any scans/appointments before 9am. Before 9am is too early.
@westcoasteagles I find it unacceptable that footballers have to wait 24 hours for scan results. They should get them immediately.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Tulla Freeway after an earlier accident at English Street. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
I've blocked at least 20 users this morning but these stupid promo tweets keep popping up on my timeline. Get lost.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: All inbound lanes now open on Tulla Fwy at English St after an earlier accident. Delays down to 10 minutes. #melbtraffic
@vline_seymour I think we can safely assume your services won't be running before 12pm, and even 12pm might be overly optimistic.
@metrotrains I think we can safely assume trains won't be running Broadmeadows&gt;Craigieburn before 12pm, and it may be even later than that.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Two right lanes now closed inbound on Tulla Fwy at English St due to an accident. Delays up to 30 minutes. #melbtraffic

I've had to do some blocking this morning due to the high number of promo tweets that have been popping up on my timeline.
@vline_seymour Sadly a person has been hit by a freight train. Expect disruption to last between 2 and 4 hours.
@VicRoads Hi. Your site is still displaying the accident on the Western Ring Rd near the Calder Fwy from yesterday. Please fix.
@nationalrailenq That didn't take long.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans At least this injury hasn't stopped him from running, so no need for time in the VFL. Straight back in.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans No, his x-rays gave him a green light. He'll start full ball work next week and play Richmond on the 17th.
@magpie_fans Do you think Steele would have been more likely to have his x-rays at 8am or 9am?
@magpie_fans I wouldn't take an 8am appointment if I could avoid it. 9am is early enough. Not too early but gets it out of the way.
@magpie_fans So put a line through Steele for Friday night but pencil him in for the following Sunday.
@magpie_fans Although some might be 8-6 to allow for appointments before or after work. But I think most would be 9-5.
@magpie_fans At a guess, what hours would x-ray clinics be open (apart from emergency ones). I mean appointment ones.
@mckenzie_jon @dayna_36 @kristin542 @mattys123 I don't like doctor's appointments before 9am.
@mckenzie_jon @dayna_36 @kristin542 @mattys123 What time is your appointment with the specialist?
@magpie_fans That he'll play against Richmond or that he's had a complication?
@thedak04 @dayna_36 @kristin542 @mattys123 There seems to be a delay with today's x-ray results.
@magpie_fans There's no "Sidebottom suffers setback" headline, so I think he'll be back for the Richmond game.
@magpie_fans I don't think he's had a setback/complication, otherwise it would be all over Twitter. Happens every time a Pie has a setback.
@kristin542 @dayna_36 @mattys123 I'd say that's highly likely. 5 weeks is better than 8.
@mattys123 @dayna_36 @kristin542 Yeah. Have a full week of ball work next week and good chance for Richmond. No setback/complication.
@dayna_36 @kristin542 @mattys123 I highly doubt he's had a setback, otherwise it would be all over Twitter.
@mattys123 So did Sidebottom's status bypass the orange category en route from red to green?
@mattys123 2/2 For injury status, won't play this week is red, a chance to play this week is orange and will play this week is green.
@mattys123 So in summing up, for MRP status, a suspension/direct tribunal referral is red, a fine is orange and no charge laid is green. 1/2
@mattys123 Did it bypass orange?
@mattys123 No Magpies' injury status turned red this weekend, and all MRP statuses were green. Did anyone's injury status turn orange?
@mattys123 I believe the EPL has a traffic light system for players' injury and MRP status.
@mattys123 For example: Jamie Elliott. MRP status: green. Injury status: green.
@mattys123 Same with injuries. Won't play this week is red, in doubt is orange and will play this week is green.
@mattys123 Remember, a suspension or a direct tribunal referral is red, a fine is orange and no charge laid is green.
@mattys123 What colour is our MRP status this week?
Puke. Barf. Bleh. 
@Magpie_Fans When is Sidebottom due to have x-rays on his right thumb?
@the_rail_life Anything in the budget to fast-track works on the Stony Point line?
@boomer_magpies @_ria84 Whereas if we were in poor form, we might have rushed him. Poor form often causes clubs to rush injured players.
@nationalrailenq That's true, but at least these red triangles were planned in advance, so it's not so bad.
@nationalrailenq I don't mind the red triangles on your service indicator because these are planned works, so they're for a good cause.
CODE GREEN ALERT: There are currently no disruptions on our roads or our rail network. All routes are clear. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
BREAKING: @CollingwoodFC has been given the all clear by the @AFL MRP following Friday night's big win over the FILTH. #greenlight
@craigsta9010 Our last quarters this year have been a lot stronger, hence our percentage of 147. We're 4 for 5 in last quarters to date.
@craigsta9010 But if we can be 9-2 or 8-3 at the bye, that'll give us some margin for error should we slip up post bye.
@craigsta9010 I thought the bye in early May last year really disrupted our season. This year we don't have a bye until mid June.
@craigsta9010 Still, I can't see the wheels falling off as badly as they did last year.
@magpie_fans How did we get Jamie?
@magpie_fans Never in doubt! I think we'll need him going forward.
@collingwoodfc Whoops! Wrong Twitter handle! That should read @elliott_jw! Sorry Jamie! #gopies
So much for the mass exodus at @CollingwoodFC. @ellioot_jw has signed on for 3 more years. #gopies
@craigsta9010 You underestimate a good side at your peril.
. @CollingwoodFC Hi guys, who's the next current Pie to have a birthday, and how old will he be?
. @elliott_jw has re-signed with @CollingwoodFC until the end of the 2018 season. #gopies
@yarratrams Looks like delays are up to 15 minutes. I hope they don't escalate.
@vicroads I believe this incident has well and truly cleared but an error occurred when you tried to remove/update it.
@iamtheoracle I've just written to the club to thank them for taking my feedback onboard.
@iamtheoracle In what circumstances would the fixture not suit?
@iamtheoracle I think having open training at the end of the week creates a better atmosphere for fans as it's closer to game day.
@iamtheoracle I'm glad they've taken my feedback onboard and moved open training back to later in the week and later in the morning.
@iamtheoracle I ask so I can follow any developments from that session.
@iamtheoracle Our open training session this week is Thursday at 10:30am. When is our closed main session?
@iamtheoracle And the other positive stat this year is that we've won 4 last quarters out of 5.
@iamtheoracle The win against the Lions was a great effort in the circumstances, and the win against the Bombers was pretty special too.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All outbound lanes now open on Monash Fwy at Springvale Rd after crash. Delays have cleared &amp; traffic is ok. #melbtraffic
@CollingwoodFC Hi. Thanks for taking onboard my feedback last year by moving open training back to later in the week &amp; later in the morning.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Only right lane now closed outbound on Monash Fwy at Springvale Rd due to  crash. Delays down to 20 minutes. #melbtraffic
@themightypies Our next open training session is Thursday at 10:30am. Exactly the same time as last week.
Attention @CollingwoodFC fans - Open training this week is Thursday at 10:30am at Olympic Park Oval. It's a 60 minute session. #gopies
CODE ORANGE ALERT: 2 RHL still closed OB on Monash Fwy at Svale Rd, crash w/ diesel spill. Current delays up to 30 minutes. #melbtraffic
@mattys123 Great news. I think we're going to need him going forward.
@mattys123 How long ago did this re-signing become official?
CODE GREEN ALERT: The disruption on the South Morang and Hurstbridge lines has cleared. Services are back running to timetable. #metrotrains
CODE RED ALERT: 3 RHL still closed outbound on Monash Fwy at Svale Rd, crash w/ diesel spill. Could be 1-2hrs. 40min delays. #melbtraffic
@9newsmelb @melbtraffic @theheraldsun I remember that horrendous accident that closed the Monash Fwy at Warrigal Rd for 4 hours in March.
@melbtraffic @9newsmelb @theheraldsun If it's a diesel spill, I think it may take a couple of hours. Hope they don't have to close the fwy.
CODE RED ALERT: 3 RHL still closed OB on Monash Fwy at Springvale Rd due to car and truck accident. Delays now up to 40minutes. #melbtraffic
CODE GREEN ALERT: Bungower Rd was briefly closed at Frankston-Flinders Rd due to an accident, but has now reopened. No delays. #melbtraffic
CODE ORANGE ALERT: 3 RHL closed OB  on Monash Fwy at Springvale Rd due to car and truck accident. Delays up to 20 minutes. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic @sunriseon7 @thetodayshow I'd expect traffic to be disrupted for most of the morning, maybe until as late as lunchtime.
@jimmytraffic Hope they don't have to close it outright like what happened at Warrigal Road in March.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Delays up to 10 minutes on the South Morang and Hurstbridge lines due to an earlier ill passenger at FSS. #metrotrains
@magpie_fans 147% is like having an extra win.
@mattys123 I think it's going to be a very tight competition this year, so percentage will be critical.
@mattys123 Yeah. Even though the Dogs are 3rd, their percentage is at 102, which is precarious.
@mattys123 Our big win over the FILTH on Friday night took our percentage up from 128 to 147. What do you think of our percentage at 147?
@CollingwoodFC's big win over the FILTH on Friday night gained them 19% and sees them in 2nd place with their percentage at a healthy 147.
@mattys123 Still on a high after our massive win over the FILTH on Friday night.
Still riding high after @CollingwoodFC's massive win over the FILTH on Friday night. #gopies

@mattys123 @collingwoodfc @vflpies The ultimate birthday present!
@vflpies That nearly gave me a cardiac arrhythmia. Great effort by the boys to hold on. Especially as it's my 28th birthday today!
@vflpies Need to find the right balance between holding possession and not getting pinned in our backline.
@vflpies Phew. For a while there I thought the Dogs were going to get on a real rroll. We've regrouped well here.
@vflpies Phew. My fears of conceding a coast to coast goal from the previous kick out on the full have been allayed.
@vflpies Now to lock it in our forward line. It would be most disheartening if they went coast to coast and goaled here.
@VFLPies We needed that! The warning lights were definitely flashing red!
CODE GREEN ALERT: There are currently no disruptions on our roads or our rail network. Everything is all clear. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@metrotrains Green lights on my line are the ultimate present from you guys!
@metrotrains I live in Canterbury. What colour is the Belgrave/Lilydale line showing on your healthboard for my birthday?
@iamtheoracle Nothing better. Especially because we had the foot on the throat from the opening siren to the final siren.
@iamtheoracle I think our performance is being undersold. We were on our game for the whole 120 minutes. Never gave them a look in.
@nationalrailenq I hope everything's back to normal by 08:30 tomorrow as I turn 28 at that time.
@CollingwoodFC I'm going to the game tonight. Some friends bought me tickets as a birthday present as I turn 28 at 8:30am tomorrow.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies You can't be criticised for every single goal you concede.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies A lot less of the goals we concede are coming from clangers or missed tackles. That's good.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies I don't think there's an official stat for missed tackles, but I think there should be.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies Those kill you. 80% of attempted tackles stuck is a big improvement.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies What percentage of our attempted tackles do you think we stuck last year?
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies What percentage of attempted tackles stuck do you think we're currently going at?
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies What percentage of tackles stuck would you consider acceptable?
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies Just to clarify, I'd say we stuck 50% of our tackles last year, whereas this year, it's more like 80%
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies Because I'd say we're sticking 80-90% of our tackles. Missed tackles are a killer.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies If it had happened last year, I would have said we were doomed, but we're going okay so far this year.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies I'm a lot more confident we can fill injury gaps now than I was last year.
@davis_harr Oh dear. Hope your headache goes away soon. Remember, I turn 28 on Saturday.
@themightypies @dayna_36 @magpie_fans Which thumb is it, and what colour do you think the skin went when the incident occurred?
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies In actual fact, this is better than expected. The initial estimate was Round 10.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies Okay, I guess my stubbornness is due to the fact that I'm a torian. Richmond it is.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies The Richmond game is just a bit too long.
@thedak04 @dayna_36 @magpie_fans That's too long.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans @themightypies I disagree. I'm tipping a return next Friday night for Sidebottom.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans No, I honestly think he'll push hard for next Friday night. I don't think that's unrealistic.
@magpie_fans @dayna_36 But that doesn't rule him out of next Friday night.
@magpie_fans If there was a big queue on the day of an x-ray appointment, would footballers have to wait or would they get priority?
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans Maybe he had his x-rays today and now it's a matter of testing it at training next week.
@magpie_fans @dayna_36 Would he have purposely scheduled his appointment on a day that we don't have a main training session?
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans So given we train Wednesday and Thursday, I suspect his x-rays are either Monday or Tuesday.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans If his x-rays weren't until Thursday, he wouldn't have time to test it at training before next Friday night.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans Just heard Sidebottom is pushing for a return next Friday night, so his x-ray appointment must be early in the week.
@collingwoodfc Hi guys. I believe Sidebottom is to have an x-ray on his right thumb next week. Do you know what day?
@aflfootyshow @barrettdamian @gwsgiants Also hearing reports Steele Sidebottom could return next Friday night, much earlier than expected.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 2/2 I only wish I knew what day the appointment is so I could get a better guide.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 As mentioned, if his x-ray appointment is early in the week and it's all healed, it could be the Cats. 1/2
@dayna_36 @mattys123 2/2 I actually think Richmond is a based on a worst case scenario rather than a best case scenario.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 At a stretch, if the x-ray appointment is early in the week and it's all healed, he could play Geelong. 1/2
@dayna_36 @mattys123 He'll be back for the Richmond game. I know it. He won't let this injury keep him down.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 When is he due to get x-rayed?
@mattys123 Sorry, had to leave out a few words due to the stupid character limit, but I think you know what I mean.
@mattys123 Not giving up on the Geelong game yet, but even if it's Richmond, it's better than what looked like being Queen's Birthday.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No reported disruptions. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@mattys123 Do you think he'll spend a week in the VFL or will he come straight back in?
@mattys123 His recovery is gaining momentum rather than losing momentum, which is why I think he might push for the Geelong game.
@mattys123 I refuse to give up hope of it being earlier.
@mattys123 At least Sidebottom is ahead of schedule and could be back for the game against Geelong. It could have been a lot worse.
@mattys123 Surgery would put him out for half the season, maybe more. Best case scenario could be 6 to 8 weeks.
@mattys123 Probably 4 to 8 weeks. Still, it's slightly better than surgery.
@mattys123 Hope he doesn't need surgery. Surgery would most likely put him out for 3 months.
@dayna_36 Remember, I turn 28 at 8:30am on Saturday. What are you likely to be doing at that time?
@mattys123 Broomhead is out due to being in barf city. Swan passed a fitness test this morning and has been given the green light to play.
Broomhead is out due to illness. Barf city. Swan passed a fitness test this morning and has been given the green light to play. #gopies
@dayna_36 At least it's only the one game, unlike everything else.
@magpie_fans Yeah. Suck it up FILTH. Swanny got the green light to play. #gopies
@dayna_36 Literally. I think that's why Broomhead is out. He's had a little visit to barf city.
@magpie_fans Wearing a moonboot for a few days helped Swan and he got the medical green light following training this morning.
@themightypies But Swan passed a fitness test this morning and has been given the green light.
OFFICIAL: Dane Swan, who had an ankle injury, has been given the medical green light and will play against Carlton tomorrow night. #gopies
Works affecting multiple lines this weekend. Please see below for full info. 
@nationalrailenq What food would be the colour of the triangle displayed on your service indicator for this disruption?
@nationalrailenq And it'll be gone well and truly before my 28th birthday, which occurs at 08:30 this coming Saturday.
@nationalrailenq Well at least it won't last anywhere near as long as the disruption caused by those horrendous storms last winter.
@cta That didn't take long.
@translinkseq These are the times when I don't mind red circles on your site as they're planned disruptions.
@yarratrams That took a heck of a long time. Recovery crews were a bit tardy.
@The_Rail_Life Very sad about the incident at Narre Warren Station this morning. It breaks my heart when that happens.

@citylinkmelb @gettrafficvic @vicroads I thought they did a good job to have it reopened in less than an hour. It was a nasty accident.
@citylinkmelb Now they need to follow it up by removing the truck in a timely manner. Hoping it'll be no more than 15 minutes.
@citylinkmelb I was surprised at how quickly heavy haulage arrived. I thought they'd be at least another 15 minutes due to the traffic.
@citylinkmelb Hopefully the truck can be moved in 15 minutes or less.
CODE RED ALERT: Citylink is closed outbound at Church Street due to a truck accident. Delays up to 60 minutes. #melbtraffic

@magpie_fans I'll be 28 at 8:30am.
@magpie_fans I'm going to the game on Friday night. Some friends got me tickets as a birthday present as it's my birthday on Saturday.
@harrypotter6116 Don't get me started. Uncooperative technology makes me want to slit my wrists.
@mattys123 Especially during the pre-season when the weather is warmer. Not quite so early during the winter months.
@iamtheoracle This includes Collingwood. 9am during the pre-season and 10am during the season proper seems to be the way most clubs do it.
@iamtheoracle I've noticed a lot of clubs have their training sessions slightly earlier during the pre-season due to the warmer weather.
@mattys123 9am sessions during the pre-season and 10am sessions during the season proper seems to be the way most clubs do it.
@mattys123 I think the pre-season training sessions are slightly earlier due to the warmer weather.
@mattys123 Some clubs have training sessions in the afternoon, but I'd say most clubs have training sessions between 9am and 11am.
@mattys123 I think 10am or 10:30am is a good time for open training sessions because it makes it easier for those who live further away.
@mattys123 Similar, but ours is 30 minutes later.
@magpie_fans FYI, both us and the FILTH have an open training session on Thursday. Theirs is at 10am, ours is 30 minutes later.
@mattys123 FYI, Pies open training this week is Thursday at 10:30am, which is 30 minutes after the FILTH's session starts.
@se_railway Well at least we know this disruption is nothing of the scale of the disruption caused by those landslips last winter.
Delicious chicken fried rice with peas, snap peas, carrots, spring onions and a little bit of red chili, all thanks to @DebinMelbourne. #yum
@iamtheoracle I turn 28 at 8:30am on Saturday. What are you likely to be doing at that time?
@nationalrailenq Well at least we know it's nothing of the scale of the disruption on that line caused by landslips last winter.
@heatherkerresa Just rebooted my phone and tried the app store again and it gave me the green light.
I think the app store might be down as my phone won't connect. I tested some apps that I've already downloaded &amp; they seem to be working ok.
@iamtheoracle Any incidents to note from @CollingwoodFC's main training session today?
@metrotrains If all services were being replaced by buses, it would be black. In this case, blue is the right colour.
@metrotrains Hi. Why is the South Morang/Hurstbridge line marked as a Travel Alert (blue) rather than a Suspended (black)?
@Davis_Harr I turn 28 at 8:30am on Saturday. What are you likely to be doing at that time?
@mattys123 @thedak04 Do the Suns look a bit like the Macdonalds logo?
@mattys123 @thedak04 Which club do you think has the weakest defence/misses the most tackles?
@mattys123 @thedak04 That'll come soon enough.
@mattys123 @thedak04 And Langdon as well. He's been a great find.
@mattys123 @thedak04 Oh, and let's not forget Toovy and Williams. They're pretty reliable down back.
@mattys123 @thedak04 We're improving at not letting the ball out of our forward line easily, which takes some pressure off our backline
@thedak04 @mattys123 Although our improved tackling in midfield/up forward takes some of the pressure off our backline.
@mattys123 @thedak04 In fact, I'd be surprised if he made his senior debut before July.
@mattys123 @thedak04 That probably rules him out of AFL calculation until after our senior side's bye in mid June.
@melbournefc @jessmmurphy What is the reason for Friday's session being 15 minutes later than tomorrow's?
@mattys123 No new long term injuries for a few weeks now.
@iamtheoracle Good news for the Pies with Sidebottom now likely to return in early May and Moore's injury not as bad as first feared.
@mattys123 Good news on the injury front with Sidebottom tracking ahead of schedule and Moore's injury not as bad as first feared.
More good news for @CollingwoodFC with father-son recruit Darcy Moore's hamstring injury not as bad as first feared. May only miss one week.
@metrotrains Phew. I guess the fault wasn't as bad as I feared. It took less than an hour to fix.
@metrotrains Given what I read, the fault sounds like a serious one that will take at least 2 hours to fix, possibly longer.
@translinkseq Did it go to an orange triangle and then a green tick after the red circle or did it go directly to a green tick?
@themightypies I'd say Sidebottom is a good chance for the game against Geelong. His thumb is healing quicker than expected.
Good news for @CollingwoodFC with Steele Sidebottom now likely to return in early to mid May rather than late May or early June.
@magpie_fans He's on a similar path to Maxie in 2013. He was expected to be out for 8 weeks and it ended up being only 4.
@magpie_fans I'd say he's every chance for the game on Friday week. I said all along that he wouldn't be out for the full 8 weeks.
@mattys123 @collingwoodfc So it looks like he might be back a week or two earlier than expected. Good news.
@translinkseq And that means the icon has gone straight from a red circle to a green tick!
@nationalrailenq That disruption cleared two hours earlier than you were expecting.
@mattys123 When I talk MRP charges, red is for a suspension or a direct tribunal referral, orange is for a fine and green is for all clear.
@mattys123 6 charges laid all up this round, and no red lights. Just orange and green.
@mattys123 Was ANZAC Day medalist Paul Seedsman among the players to get an orange light from the MRP or did he get a green light?
@aflfeeds @afl No suspensions this week!
@mattys123 We haven't had a red light yet this year. Just a few orange ones, and lots of green!
@mattys123 A few orange lights (fines) from the MRP this round, but no red lights (suspensions) for any club, and lots of green lights!
BREAKING: No suspensions from #AFLRound4. Just a handful of fines.
Trying to practice my keyboard with work machinery right outside my house is quite a challenge.
@magpie_fans We're conceding less goals from clangers or missed tackles. You can't be criticised for every single goal you concede.

@metrotrains Hi. I turn 28 on Saturday. I believe the yellow icons will be on the Caulfield and Clifton Hill groups on my birthday, correct?
Attention @CollingwoodFC fans: Open training this week is Thursday at 10:30am at Olympic Park oval. The session will run for about 60 mins.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Trains are moving through Camberwell but are delayed up to 20 minutes due to a track fault at the station. #metrotrains
CODE ORANGE ALERT: All services through Camberwell are delayed up to 25 minutes due to a track equipment fault at the station. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Oh okay. Delays on the Glen Waverley line are the same length as the other three. Thanks.
@craigsta9010 We're conceding a lot less goals from clangers or missed tackles. You can't be criticised for every goal you concede.
@metrotrains The Glen Waverley line doesn't go to Camberwell.
@AFL Hi there! Is there an official stat for missed tackles? If not, I think there should be.
@craigsta9010 I don't think there's an official stat for missed tackles, but if there was, ours would be well down on last year.
@craigsta9010 Certainly a lot less mental lapses during games and also a lot less missed tackles. Missed tackles hurt big time.
STATS: @CollingwoodFC's percentage is 35% better than this time last year. Also, they've won 3 out of 4 final quarters in 2015. #gopies
@craigsta9010 Look at our percentage. It's 35% better than this time last year.
@melbtraffic @9newsmelb @paullatter I suspect it'll be closed for at least 1 to 2 hours, possibly longer.
@craigsta9010 Also, apart from Round 1, our final quarters have been a lot better this year when compared to last year.
@craigsta9010 I felt last year in a lot of our wins we were just scraping through. Our wins this year have been much stronger.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The disruption on the Cranbourne/Pakenham line has cleared. Train services are back running to timetable. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: Belgrave line services were suspended Upper FTG&gt;Belgrave due to a track fault, but have now resumed. #metrotrains
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Cranbourne/Pakenham line services are delayed up to 25 minutes due to a power supply fault at Westall. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Phew. I was expecting the line to be closed until at least 9am. Good work by your crews to fix the fault inside 60 minutes.
@venturabus This is due to a power supply fault that is delaying services on the Cranbourne/Pakenham train line.
@harrypotter6116 We're up to 3rd on the ladder. And with a good draw, we should stay there for a while.
@magpie_fans We've got a tricky 3 weeks after the June bye, but if we can be 9 and 2 or 8 and 3 at the bye, we'll have some headroom.
@magpie_fans And with a kind draw and no bye in May to disrupt our momentum, we should stay there for a while.
. @CollingwoodFC's win on #ANZACDay has sent them up to 3rd on the ladder. And with a kind draw, they should stay there for a while. #gopies
@harrypotter6116 At 8:30 in the morning?
@aleague @leighbroxham Why did you refer to it as the cheese?

@iamtheoracle hope it's huts tightnessor a slight twinge not a bad strain or tear that will spell a long time out.
OH SHIT BOMBERS GETTING AWAY FROM THE PIES THIS IS NOT GOOD. CODE RED CODE RED. #VFLDonsPies
@magpie_fans Missed tackles in defence are the worst. Huge improvement in tackling all over the ground.
I've noticed @CollingwoodFC are sticking a lot more of their tackles this year. Way too many missed tackles last year and it hurt big time.
@magpie_fans I've noticed more of our tackles are sticking this year. Way too many missed tackles last year and that hurt big time.
. @DebinMelbourne reckons the reason for Essendon's last quarter fadeouts is because the drugs wear off. LOL.

@wtoptraffic I was going to say the investigation took too long, but after reading the link, I decided that might have been a little harsh.
@harrypotter6116 Great win by the Pies. And for the second week in a row, we walk away with no new injuries!
@metrotrains That took a heck of a long time and as a result has caused excessive congestion which will take forever to clear.
@metrotrains @victoriapolice Is it a bunch of disgruntled Essendon supporters after their loss to Collingwood today?
@mattys123 Remember, I turn 28 at 8:30am next Saturday. What are you likely to be doing at that time?
@mattys123 Our defence is much improved on last year. And for the second game running, we walk away injury free!
@mattys123 Then he'd better not touch the red part or he'll burn his hand! #joke
Another great win by @CollingwoodFC. And for the second week running, we walk away injury free! #LookingGood #gopies
@mattys123 What colour is the medal that goes round the winner's neck?
@mattys123 Whoops! That should be the ANZAC Day medal. #typo
@mattys123 Is the ANZAD Day medal a trophy/cup thing or does it go around his neck?
@magpie_fans @paulseed40 I'm vision impaired. Is the ANZAC Day medal a cup/trophy or does it go round his neck?
@themightypies FYI, if you mix the 50m line and the goal line together, the line would be pink. Red and white mixed together make pink.
@themightypies Did that ball bounce before going through the goals or did it go through on the full?
@themightypies If you mix our 50m line this quarter with the goal line, do you know what colour you'd get?
@themightypies I had a red apple today and it was delicious. Is the blue 50m line light blue, royal blue or dark blue?
@themightypies What food would be that shade of red?
@themightypies Is the red on the Bombers the same shade of red?
@themightypies Is that line the same shade of red as a red traffic light?
@mattys123 Do we have the blue 50m line or the red 50m line this quarter?
@themightypies Are we kicking to the blue 50m line or the red 50m line this quarter?
@mattys123 Is the red on the Bombers the same shade of red as a red traffic light or the error light on your printer?
@mattys123 Our defence is holding up a lot better than last year. We're conceding less goals from clangers or lack of defensive pressure.
@magpie_fans I think our defence is holding up a lot better than it did last year. Conceding less goals from soft defence.
@magpie_fans Then again, Essendon have missed some chances as well.
@mattys123 Great effort to weather the storm when the Dons were all over us. Much improved on last year when in similar situations.
@magpie_fans Great effort to weather the storm when Essendon were all over us. Much improved from last year in similar situations.

@melbtraffic But there is some good news, Queens Road has just reopened at Kings Way (earlier than I expected).
@jimmytraffic How long before OB open? 60 secs? 15 mins?
@peter_mitchell7 Hoping it's not a long closure, but I fear it will be. Hoping for a 6pm reopening, but I fear it'll be at least 8pm.
@jimmytraffic Hoping for a quick reopening, but I'd say that's unrealistic. Any earlier than 6pm I'll treat as a good result.
CODE RED ALERT: Queens Rd closed at Kings Way due to truck hitting pole. May take all PM peak. 60min delays through diversions. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic 2/2 In fact, if it reopens before 6pm, I'll treat that as a good result.
@melbtraffic Queens Road is now closed both ways at Kings Way. It may be closed for most if not all of the PM peak. 1/2
@9newsmelb Hoping it's only brief, but I fear it'll take most if not all of the PM peak. I'll treat a reopening before 6pm as good result.
@vicroads If the repairs can be done before 6pm, I'd treat that as a reasonable outcome.
@vicroads Hoping it won't be too much longer but I fear it'll take up most if not all of the PM peak.
@melbtraffic @9newsaus @9newsmelb Not to be a pesimist, but I fear it'll be closed until at least 7pm.
@iamtheoracle That was an ugly season for the Pies. We lost two games by more than 100 points.
@bythemincricket How's the weather looking over there? I believe quite a bit of time has already been lost to rain.
@networkrail This is compared with 8 long term disruptions last winter. Had to say that in two tweets because I ran out of characters.
@networkrail I'm very pleased that you got through winter with only one long term disruption, that being the #HarburyLandslip.
@mattys123 @sidebyside @themightypies Yep, they've dropped him. Totally the wrong decision. Also wrong making him the sub last week.
@mattys123 @sidebyside @themightypies And it would be especially cruel on his birthday.
@themightypies @mattys123 @sidebyside Would be unfair if PK was dropped after 25 minutes of game time, but I've got a feeling he might be.
@metrotrains Hi Metro, what is the reason for the 15 minute delays on the Burnley group? No reason given on your site or Metro Notify.
@nationalrailenq Uh oh. Is London Bridge falling down?
@metrotrains I'm vision impaired. What colour uniforms do your signal technicians wear?
@metrotrains That didn't take long at all. Only 15 minutes. Good work by your signal technicians.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Burnley group lines were bypassing the loop for a short time due to a signal fault, but this has now cleared. #metrotrains

@themightypies @_shmick @mattys123 @thedak04 I refuse to give up hope that both he and Sidebottom will make earlier than expected returns.
@thedak04 @_shmick @mattys123 I'm still hoping this latest injury won't be an 8 to 12 week job.
@the_rail_life This is dragging on way too long and I'm starting to get impatient. ☹
@_shmick @mattys123 @thedak04 But if he plays 3 or 4 blinders in the VFL, that might bring it forward. Not giving up hope.
Wow! This guy totally blew a foofer valve! 
@The_Rail_Life Am I still a chance to get my birthday wish for trains being back to Stony Point? My birthday is at 8:30am on Saturday week.
@themightypies To be honest, I never thought he'd actually done his quad. A genuine quad strain usually means 4-6 weeks.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
Relief for Ben Reid with scans revealing only a corked quad rather than a strain or a tear: 
Phew. Not another serious injury. 
@CollingwoodFC Hi. I believe Patty K turns 23 on Thursday, correct?
@mattys123 @thedak04 So for once, it's not all bad news. By the way, does PK turn 23 tomorrow, Thursday or Friday?
Phew. Which leg?@Mattys123
@mattys123 Maybe just maybe scans today will reveal minimal or no damage and he'll be back training before the end of April.
@mattys123 I highly doubt he's torn his quad. Or at least, I won't believe it until it's confirmed. I'll treat it as a nick at this stage.
@dayna_36 @magpie_fans I also refuse to give up hope of an early return for Sidebottom. Hoping it's early May rather than mid-late May.
@magpie_fans @dayna_36 Probably due to the amount of footy he's missed.
@dayna_36 I refuse to give up hope that it won't cause a substantial delay to his senior return.
@mattys123 I'm not giving up hope that this quad nick won't delay Reid's return significantly.
@mattys123 But that could bring Moore's senior debut forward.
@mattys123 Phew. Just a slight twinge. A genuine quad strain is usually 3 to 4 weeks at a minimum.
@dayna_36 8:30am was a good time to come out.
@dayna_36 What will you be doing as I'm turning 28? Sleeping?
@craigsta9010 Nothing in the Monday injury report. I suspect it's either a false alarm or it's very minor.
@3awisfootball @_ria84 I can confirm that there were no injuries from Friday night, nor were there reports.
@_ria84 @3awisfootball I suspect it's either a false alarm or it's not serious enough to put in the report.
@_ria84 @3awisfootball No, it's probably not.
@magpie_fans If it's a quad, that's a minimum of 4 weeks, and I suspect significantly longer. But I highly doubt the rumor is true.
@mattys123 I quite like Thursday night footy. I don't think anyone would go to an AFL game at 8:30 in the morning.
@mattys123 If you had to choose between Collingwood V Carlton at 8:30am or Collingwood V Carlton on a Thursday night, which would u choose?
@mattys123 For 2nd year running, we play the FILTH on my birthday weekend. I jokingly suggested the game be played at 8:30am on my birthday.
@harrypotter6116 Although I have to give some credit to Adelaide. They're in red hot form at the moment.
@mattys123 I turn 28 at 8:30am on Saturday week (May 2nd). What are you likely to be doing at that time?
@dayna_36 Couple of birthdays coming up. My sister Gemma turns 22 at 3:40am on Thursday week, then I turn 28 at 8:30am on Saturday week.
@dayna_36 @mattys123 @sidebyside @stephenc24 I've looked all over Twitter and not a peep. 3AW stands for 3 Always Wrong.
@magpie_fans I've looked all over Twitter and there's no mention of a quad injury to Ben Reid. The AW stands for Always Wrong.
@jdestoop80_fox @foxsportsnews But no new injuries for @CollingwoodFC.
@harrypotter6116 2/2 So it's just as well we fought it out against Adelaide and didn't roll over and lose by 70 or 80 points.
@harrypotter6116 Absolutely. It's going to be a tight competition this year, so percentage could make all the difference. 1/2

@iamtheoracle What do you think is the earliest it would be?
@iamtheoracle Do you think Collingwood's open training sessions would ever be at 8am or is that a little early?
@vicroads Although I can confirm thanks to @yarratrams that the accident has just cleared in the last 90 seconds.
@mattys123 And with no new injuries, a reasonable  draw and plenty of players to return in the coming weeks, we're looking good.
@mattys123 Our win on Friday night has shot our ladder position up to 6th &amp; our percentage up to 125. And more importantly, no new injuries!
@Mackay92_Sean Works on the Frankston line Sat night. Buses Moorabbin&gt;Mordialloc after 7:30pm. Info will be up on my page on Thursday.

. @CollingwoodFC's win on Friday night has sent them shooting from 12th to 6th on the ladder and their percentage from 90 to 125. #gopies
@venturabus This has caused a backlog of trains and has resulted in the boom gates staying down for an extended period.
@venturabus This is due to a ffaulty train and an earlier signal fault which is causing disruption to trains on the Belgrave/Lilydale line.
Ugh. I've got a splitting headache and a runny nose and I feel like I'm going to barf. Bleh.
@harrypotter6116 Nothing better than Collingwood winning on a Friday. And walking away injury free. And the filth losing.
@vflpies Now let's lock it in our forward half and not give the Roosters an easy out.
@vflpies Lucky not to concede a goal that is.
@vflpies Bad clanger. We definitely got lucky there.

@nationalrailenq And that leaves you with a full set of green ticks on your service indicator!
@metrotrains Phew. For a moment there I feared we might see more of those ugly black icons on your healthboard. Glad it was only red.
@mattys123 I'd say the majority of printers have a green light for ready, an orange light for standby and a red light for an error.
@mattys123 I think from coldest to hottest, it goes blue, green, yellow, orange, then red.
@mattys123 My phone has a Bluetooth keyboard with a blue light. I'd say that light is a freezing cold colour.
@mattys123 I'd say the ready light is a cool colour, the standby light is a warm colour and the error light is a hot colour.
@mattys123 Would the standby light be closest in colour to twisties, cheesels or burger rings?
@mattys123 What foods/drinks have you had today that was one of the three printer light colours?
@mattys123 Why do no clubs have the colour of the ready light?
@mattys123 The Swans have the colour of the error light on your printer and the Giants have the colour of the standby light.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The Hurstbridge line was closed for 7 hours due to a fatality at Heidelberg, but has now reopened. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Hence we saw red and now orange on your healthboard rather than black. I'd say 95% of fallen trees cause line suspensions.
@metrotrains Why did the fallen tree near Frankston only cause delays rather than a line suspension?
@metrotrains Good to see the Hurstbridge line reopened, but I felt it should have happened 3 hours ago. The 7 hour closure was excessive.
@metrotrains I feel they should have let you resume running trains at least 2 hours ago and it's bordering on unacceptable. ☹
@metrotrains I'm not happy with the amount of time it's taking for emergency services to let you resume trains on the Hurstbridge line. ☹
@metrotrains @james_comito It's now been well over 6 hours. This is unacceptable.
@mattys123 I agree. The time limit should depend on the sport. 2 minutes for cricket, 90 seconds for NRL and 60 seconds for AFL.
@mattys123 In fact, there was a catch that was reviewed in the T20 Big Bash in January that took 8 minutes. Totally unacceptable.
@mattys123 I reckon DRS challenges in cricket are right up there for taking longer than they should. Some of those can take up to 5 minutes.
@mattys123 Right result, but the review took too long.
That score review was unnecessary and also took too long. #AFLSwansVGiants
@metrotrains When are you expecting trains to be back running? Seriously it's taking way too long. ☹
@adelaide_fc @theadelaideoval And Smith has passed all his concussion tests and has been given the green light to play.
@translinkseq That was quick. And it was never a red circle. It's already gone from an orange triangle back to a green tick.
@boomer_magpies @martin_sanna Good to see Karnezis get his opportunity. Gives us another marking target up forward.
@yarratrams Although outbound Glen Waverley trains are delayed 15 mins due to an earlier train malfunction at Parliament. Ping @metrotrains
@MelbTraffic Crash on Princes Hwy near Monash Fwy. Right lane closed in both directions. Delays up to 25 minutes for that section alone.
@tazelder And now there's a crash on the Princes Highway near the Monash Freeway. The right lane is closed in both directions as a result.
@footytips 2/2 the log in field and a red light when the site is down or an error occurs.
@footytips Hey, I think your site should give a green light when you're logged on, an orange light when the page is loading or you're in 1/2
@mattys123 If that game had been last year, I think that would have been a 70 or 80 point loss, not a 27 point loss.
@mattys123 I'm glad we kept last week's loss to less than 5 goals and prevented our percentage from taking a potentially catastrophic hit.
@mattys123 What margin are you tipping we'll win by? I've tipped 25 points.
@mattys123 What about Reualt? Similar situation? Excuse me if I spelled his name wrong?
@mattys123 What chance, in percentage terms, would you give Pendlbury and Adams of being late outs tonight?
. @metrotrains I believe we'll be seeing quite a bit of yellow on your healthboard this weekend, correct?
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No incidents to disrupt your journey. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@sw_trains So it's probably safe to assume that after a fire is put out, it'll most likely be a further 15 minutes before trains run again.
@nationalrailenq So it's red, but an improving red.
@nationalrailenq The triangle on your service indicator is still red but the disruption no longer has the word "major" in front of it.
@themightypies And Pendlebury, Adams and Varco fears seem to have been allayed. I like our 22.
@sw_trains In this case, after the extra 15 minute wait, there was no damage and trains were given the green light to run again.
@sw_trains And that's assuming there's no damage to the infrastructure. If there is damage, it can be a lot longer.
@sw_trains With most lineside fires, there's usually at least a 15 minute gap between the fire being extinguished and the line reopening.
@sw_trains Now I get it. An extra 15 minute delay may well have ended up saving time.
@sw_trains I meant the 15 minute delay in reopening the lines after the fire was put out, not the delay in putting the fire out.
@sw_trains Don't know why they opted to wait an extra 15 minutes after the fire was extinguished. Slightly unnecessary delay.
@networkrail @nationalrailenq Track repairs didn't progress quite as quickly as I would have liked. Glad they're done now though.

@collingwoodfc Still refusing to give up hope of an early return for Sidebottom and Greenwood. Great news on Scharenburg.
@mattys123 The Brodie Smith KO incident was looked at by the MRP &amp; got the all clear, giving Taylor Adams the green light for Friday night.
@mattys123 What do you like seeing more? A green traffic light or the green light on the printer?
@mattys123 But you don't mind an orange light on the printer because it's a standby indicator. It's just red that you don't want to see.
@mattys123 I bet you'd rather see a red traffic light than the red light on the printer.
@mattys123 A red light on the printer is not good, but on some other electronic devices, a red light means it's turned on.
@mattys123 What does it mean when the light on the printer is the colour that AFL umpires usually wear?
@mattys123 I think orange is the right colour for standby. It's a neutral colour.
@mattys123 Taylor Adams' former club has the standby/thinking light colour.
@mattys123 Two out of three because your printer also has an orange light for standby/when it's "thinking" as well as the green and the red.
@mattys123 Do either of the NRL teams playing tonight have a printer light colour?
@mattys123 I meant for Friday night. Sorry.
@mattys123 The Pies' opponents have the colour of the light that you don't want to see on the printer.
@mattys123 Did the printer let you down last time you used it or was it on its best behaviour?
@firey81 @jimmytraffic The ramp has just reopened.
@_ria84 @ichriso1 @themightypies I think they'll both be fine. Adams was also looked at by the MRP and given the green light.
@collingwoodfc @levigreenwood So maybe there's still a chance he might make an earlier than expected return.
@_ria84 @ichriso1 @themightypies If they were in serious doubt, I'm sure they would have been mentioned.
@_ria84 @ichriso1 @themightypies Nothing in the official injury update, so they must not think either of them are in trouble.
@mattys123 Pendlebury's been green all career. I can't see him ever getting reported.
@mattys123 Elliott was orange last week as he got fined. No reds yet. All Collingwood players were green this week.
@paigecardona It's good. He's been cleared of any wrongdoing by the MRP.
BREAKING: @CollingwoodFC has been given the all clear by the @AFL MRP following Saturday's game against @Adelaide_FC. #greenlight
@mattys123 Taylor Adams was looked at. Did he come up red, orange or green?
@mattys123 In traffic light terms, for MRP charges, suspensions are red, fines are orange and no charge is green.
Ew. Gross. Yuck. Barf. 
@mattys123 So they'll probably get to the club around 9am.
@mattys123 As mentioned, Thursday's session is at 10:30am. What time do you think the players will arrive at the club?
@mattys123 Do you think open training would ever be at 8am or would that be a bit early?
A timing error cost @HawthornFC victory yesterday. The umpires were also unkind to them on a number of occasions.
@superfooty @hawthornfc The umpires cost them on a number of occasions.
@mattys123 Is it the coach or the football department who's responsible for arranging the date and time for each open session?
@mattys123 I agree. Best they can do. Sounds like the club has taken onboard my feedback from last year re open training sessions.
@CollingwoodFC Hi there! I believe there are a few upcoming birthdays in Pie land, correct?
@adelaide_fc Who's the next current Crow to have a birthday, and how old will he be?
@adelaide_fc Oh well, I guess fans will just have to get used to earlier open sessions under Walsh. Excuse me if I spelled his name wrong.
@adelaide_fc Why is open training now at 9am? That might be a bit early for some. Last year it was 10am. I thought that worked well.
@mattys123 Collingwood's open training session this week is Thursday at 10:30am. What do you think of the day of the week and time of day?

@vflpies We needed that goal because the Roosters were starting to get on a bit of a roll.
@vflpies That's been a major problem for the senior side in the last few years. Too slow to transition from attack to defence.
@vflpies That was always on the cards. We miss multiple shots, then they go coast-to-coast. Poor defence on that occasion too.
@melbtraffic Which two lanes are closed on the Monash?

@vicroads I'm a little annoyed that it took two hours longer than expected. I felt the time taken for the operation was excessive.
@metrotrains Finally. After 8 hours. I felt the time taken for that operation was manifestly excessive.
@metrotrains This means trains should be able to stop there from about now.
@metrotrains Just heard that the bomb squad has given the all clear at Hoppers Crossing and the exclusion zone has reopened.
@3aw693 It frustrates me that the all clear has been given and yet they're deciding to wait an extra 15mins before lifting exclusion zone.
@3aw693 In fact, it is now reopened. No reason to wait an extra 15 minutes.
@metrotrains I've almost given up hope of trains stopping at Hoppers Crossing tonight as police are being very tight lipped.
@the_rail_life I thought they did well to get trains back running on both lines before the PM peak.
@the_rail_life Not a good day on the trains. We had a bomb squad incident at Hoppers Crossing, then a person hit by a train at Patterson.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now after a disruptive peak period. Every thing is back to normal. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: Hoppers Crossing Station has reopened following a bomb squad investigation. Services are running well. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Same with the Frankston line. I wrote that off as being closed until 5 or 6pm. Great job all round handling this afternoon.
@metrotrains I think you did an amazing job getting trains back running for the PM peak. I can imagine it would have been a huge challenge.
@metrotrains Just to clarify, I'm not laying any of the blame at your feet. You're doing a great job. It's just that it's a Friday night.
@metrotrains Well it's dragging on way too long and I'm starting to get impatient. ☹
@metrotrains Hi. When are trains going to be stopping at Hoppers Crossing again? This police operation is taking an eternity.
@dayna_36 It's all clear now in that area. Everything's been reopened.
@venturabus But there is some good news, Centre Road has reopened at the level crossing in Bentleigh after an earlier accident.
. @metrotrains From what I gather, the closures in Hoppers Crossing are expected to be in place until around 6pm (another 15 minutes).
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Pakenham line after an earlier trespasser at Narre Warren. Services are running ok. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: Centre Road was closed at the level crossing in Bentleigh due to a crash, but has now reopened. No delays. #melbtraffic
@dayna_36 Especially on a Friday afternoon.
@mattys123 Does it go orange while printing is in progress or does it stay green?
@dayna_36 They've just reopened Centre Road in Bentleigh after the earlier incident. All alerts for this disruption are back to green.
@mattys123 So just to clarify, you don't want to see a red light on the printer, but an orange light is okay.
@mattys123 Is Adelaide's red the same shade of red as the error light on your printer?
@mattys123 Looks like Rory Sloan could be a late scratching for tomorrow's game. He missed final training this morning with a bandaged leg.
@mackay92_sean All clear now on the Frankston line after an earlier incident. Patterson Station has reopened too. No delays.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Patterson Station has reopened following a person having been hit by a train. Services are running well. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Shouldn't that be marked as a Travel Alert (blue icon)? #WrongColour
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Some Pakenham line trains have been delayed 15mins due to a trespasser at Narre Warren. Line is now clear. #metrotrains
@metrotrains So just to clarify, Frankston &amp;  Werribee lines are open but Patterson &amp; Hoppers Crossing Stations are out of bounds, correct?
CODE BLUE ALERT: Frankston line trains running but bypassing Patterson until around 5:30pm due to a person hit by a train. #metrotrains
CODE BLUE ALERT: Werribee line trains running but bypassing Hoppers Crossing until around 6pm due to bomb squad investigation. #metrotrains
@dayna_36 It's still a red alert for traffic, but only a blue alert for trains.
@dayna_36 It was a red alert when trains were stopped, but with trains running but bypassing Patterson, it's now been downgraded to blue.
@dayna_36 A person has been hit. Trains just started running again but they're not stopping at Patterson.
@mackay92_sean Frankston line reopened but trains not stopping at Patterson. I mistakenly thought the incident was at Bentleigh. Apologies.
@metrotrains How did you manage to get Frankston &amp; Werribee trains running before the PM peak? I thought they'd be shut a few more hours.
CODE BLUE ALERT: Werribee line trains resumed running but will not stop at Hoppers Crossing due to bomb squad investigation. #metrotrains
CODE BLUE ALERT: Frankston line trains resumed running but will not stop at Patterson due to person hit by train. #metrotrains
. @metrotrains Just heard from @vline_geelong that their services have resumed, so yours should also be resuming about now.
CODE RED ALERT: Werribee line disruption  to extend past 4pm. Delays up to 90 minutes. More info here: 
CODE RED ALERT: Frankston line bus section extended. Delays over 60 minutes. Details here: 
@mackay92_sean Correction: It's now closed Caulfield&gt;Mordialloc. Delays may be over 60 minutes.
@metrotrains I'm hoping it'll be resolved before the PM peak, but I'm getting less optimistic by the minute.
@Mackay92_sean Avoid the Frankston line it's closed Caulfield&gt;Moorabbin until at least 5pm due to person hit by train at Bentleigh.
. @metrotrains At this stage, which of the two incidents that have caused line closures is likely to be resolved first?
CODE RED ALERT: Major disruption on the Frankston and Werribee lines. Please see below for full info.

@mcniffcolin Just to clarify, is the light solid green then flashing red or flashing green then flashing red?
@mcniffcolin Is the green light solid and the red light flashing or do they both flash?
@mcniffcolin But no orange. Is there also a green light for correct weight, red for a protest and orange for a possible protest?
@McniffColin Hi there! I'm vision impaired. In horse racing, what colour is the flashing light on top of the starting gates?
Works on the Frankston line this weekend. Please see below for full info. 
@nationalrailenq The line was expected to be closed for another 90 minutes. Always nice when a disruption clears ahead of schedule.
@the_rail_life I also remember when a bat destroyed the signalling system at Camberwell. I wonder what the damage bill was from that.
@the_rail_life 2/2 Recovery works gained a lot of momentum in the 4 days leading up to the reopening.
@the_rail_life It was looking like being closed for up to 2 weeks at one stage. 9 days was actually a very good result. 1/2
@the_rail_life Do you still remember that horrendous accident on the Cranbourne line? I thought they did very well to reopen it in 9 days.
@magpie_fans At least a broken thumb doesn't stop you from running, so in that sense, it's better than a leg injury.
@Magpie_Fans Murray Newman's broken thumb sounds worse than Sidebottom's. Newman's looking at 12 weeks, twice as long as Sidebottom.
@mattys123 Sounds like Murray Newman's broken thumb is worse than Sidebottom's. Newman's looking at 12 weeks, twice as long as Sidebottom.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The track fault at Essendon has now been fixed. Delays on the Craigieburn line have cleared. #metrotrains
@the_rail_life So Sprinters probably out for most of the year, but trains might be weeks rather than months.
@mattys123 @craigsta9010 @lucasgarth @luke_h10 @thedak04 But not too many goals conceded through defensive lapses, which was a good sign.
@the_rail_life Well, that's on my birthday list! Trains to be back on the Stony Point line! My 28th birthday is Saturday 2 May at 8:30am.
@the_rail_life End of April would be a fantastic result. I was tipping 6 to 8 months.
@craigsta9010 @lucasgarth @luke_h10 @mattys123 @thedak04 The Crows will definitely get a much sterner test this time around.
@craigsta9010 @lucasgarth @luke_h10 @mattys123 @thedak04 Yes, the Crows were good, but North were pathetic.
@metrotrains Can we categorically rule out the Stony Point line being fixed before my 28th birthday on 2 May or am I going too early there?
@The_Rail_Life Looks like we can just about rule out the Stony Point line being fixed before my birthday on 2 May. Or have I gone too early?
CODE GREEN ALERT: The delays on the South Morang line have now cleared. Train services are back running to timetable. #metrotrains
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Delays on the Craigieburn line are down to 10 minutes due to a lingering track fault at Essendon. #metrotrains
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Outbound delays on the South Morang line are down to 10 minutes after an earlier ill passenger at Croxton. #metrotrains
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Craigieburn line services are delayed up to 25 minutes in both directions due to a track fault at Essendon. #metrotrains
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Outbound services on the South Morang line are delayed up to 20 minutes due to an ill passenger at Croxton. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: The disruption on the Caulfield group has cleared. Train services are back running to timetable. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Monash Freeway after an earlier accident at High Street. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Outbound services on the Craigieburn line are delayed up to 25 minutes due to a track fault at Essendon. #metrotrains
@metrotrains What colour uniforms do your technicians wear?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: All outbound lanes now open on Monash Fwy at High St after earlier crash but still delays up to 30 minutes. #melbtraffic
@greateranglia Only 10 minutes ago, you had no ETA for a reopening. Good to see police gave you the green light so promptly.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Outbound services on the Caulfield group are delayed up to 10 minutes due to an ill passenger at Caulfield. #metrotrains
. @CollingwoodFC Hi. Could you please give at least 2 to 3 days' notice when announcing open training sessions in future? Thanks.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The delays on the South Morang line have now cleared. Train services are back running to timetable. #metrotrains
@themightypies Also the 10am start allows for morning traffic to die down.
CODE RED ALERT: Two right lanes closed outbound on the Monash Freeway at High Street due to a crash. Delays over 30 minutes. #melbtraffic
@mattys123 Does it ever blink green, blink orange or blink red or is it always on solid?
@mattys123 What would be the worst time for it to go red?
@mattys123 Is the light currently green, orange, red or out?
@themightypies I think having open training later in the week is good, and I think 10am is about the right time. Not too early.
@mattys123 What three foods would be the right shades of their colours for the ready, standby/thinking and error light on your printer?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Two right lanes closed outbound on the Monash Freeway at High Street due to a crash. Delays up to 20minutes. #melbtraffic
@mattys123 @themightypies I doubt it. But it sounds like his is more serious than Sidebottom's because he'll be out for twice as long.
Sidebottom's not the only one with a broken thumb. West Coast's Murray Newman could miss 12 weeks with the same injury.
@melbtraffic Make that two right lanes. Delays are likely to increase.
@mattys123 @themightypies Sidebottom's not the only one with a broken thumb. A West Coast Eagle is looking at 12 weeks with the same injury.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Inbound services on the South Morang line are delayed up to 15 minutes due to a police request at Preston. #metrotrains
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Right lane closed outbound on the Monash Freeway at High Street due to an accident. Delays up to 10 minutes. #melbtraffic
@footytips Certainly! Thanks for your help.
@mattys123 What would be the worst time for the printer light to turn red?
@mattys123 An orange light isn't a bad thing as it means it's either on standby or thinking. A red light is bad. A green light is great.
@footytips Just tried your mobile site using IE and my tips were entered successfully.
@mattys123 Is it three different lights, one green, one orange and one red  or just the one light that goes green, orange and red?
@footytips Ok will do.
@mattys123 Did you get a red light last time you tried to print something off or just orange and green?
@mattys123 Did you get a red light last time you tried to print or just orange and green?
@mattys123 So green for ready, orange for standby/thinking and red for error. What sort of things will cause a red light?
@mattys123 Does it turn orange when printing is in progress or does it blink green?
@mattys123 Does it ever turn orange?
@mattys123 What food would be the colour of the light on your printer?
@unitedenergyau Always a bonus when power is restored ahead of the ETR.
@mattys123 Nothing worse than when you're trying to print something and the stupid printer won't work. Has that happened to you?
@mattys123 FYI, they drive on the right in the US, and also the traffic lights blink red instead of orange when they malfunction.
@mattys123 Would you liken the Giants' defensive play to Collingwood's at times leaky defence?
@mattys123 Should never allowed that 3-run homer. Terrible pitching. Or is that a bit harsh?
@sfgiantsfans What does RBI stand for?
. @VicRoads Left lane closed outbound on the Monash Fwy at Toorak Rd due to roadworks. Speed down to 60km/h. Slight delays on approach.
@TransLinkSEQ Phew. We won't be seeing red on this one.
. @metrotrains I had an unpleasant dream last night that the Stony Point line was going to be closed for up to 20 years.
@translinkseq That's a lot of orange on your site. Let's hope it doesn't turn red.
@mattys123 Although the other good thing with a 10am start instead of a 9am start is that it allows for morning traffic to die down.
. @collingwoodfc Also a 10am start allows for morning traffic to die down. 10am is just the right time.
@mattys123 What time would you need to leave from where you are?
. @CollingwoodFC Hi. I think 10am is about the right time for open training. That should be the time each week. 9am is a bit early for some.
@mattys123 I live in Canterbury. What time would I need to leave my house to get to open training?
@mattys123 Yeah. Near the end of the week and not too early in the morning.
@mattys123 So, do you think 10am on a Thursday is about the right day and the right time for open training?
@mattys123 I've asked them twice and they totally ignored me.
@mattys123 I'm a bit annoyed that it's not up on their website or their Twitter feed. Pretty slack in my book.
@mattys123 Still no word from the Pies re this week's open training session. Surely they'll announce it tomorrow.
@greateranglia And that leaves you with a full set of green icons on your service indicator!
@translinkseq And that means the icon on your site for this disruption has gone from a red circle to an orange triangle to a green tick.
@nationalrailenq And that leaves you with a full set of green ticks on your service indicator!
@collingwoodfc When is open training this week? Confirmation seems to be taking a lot longer than usual.
Oh barf. Don't blow this @SFGiants.
@mattys123 I think it's a little unfair that an error goes against the pitcher when a fielder drops the ball. It's not the pitcher's fault.
@mattys123 Have there been any errors from either side so far in this game?
@mattys123 They might do well to get out of this inning without conceding at least one or two more runs.
@nationalrailenq Although I can confirm thanks to @se_railway that the line has reopened in the last 10 minutes.
@se_railway Phew. Glad the works overrun was only minor and won't disrupt peak hour services.
@se_railway How long do you think that will be?
@venturabus Hearing it's a serious accident, possibly fatal. Expect disruption for some hours and delays to increase later.
@mattys123 I've asked the club to tweet each week when they announce open training for the week. You might want to do the same.
@CollingwoodFC Hi. Confirmation of open training this week is taking longer than usual. Is this due to the public holiday yesterday?
@mattys123 The Pies are very tardy in confirming the date and time for this week's open training session. Probably due to the public holiday
@nationalrailenq And that means your whole service indicator is back to green!
CODE GREEN ALERT: Despite the rain, our roads and our rail network are all clear. Please take care in the wet. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@nationalrailenq And that means the red triangles on your service indicators have been replaced with green ticks!
What a shitty day.
@theafloffseason Was the deadline for players to enter pleas moved to 12pm EST this year or is it still 11am EST?
. @CollingwoodFC Hi. When the date and time for open training is announced each week, could you please also post it on social media? Thanks.
@jletti @victoriapolice It's a miracle!
@mattys123 Also a 10am start would make it more accessible for school groups to attend.
@mattys123 I also think open training should be around 10am or 10:30am. 9am might be too early for some.
@afl @afltribunal Hi. Was the deadline for entering pleas moved to 12pm EST this year or is it still 11am EST?
@mattys123 Open training early in the week last year didn't work, especially with a 6 day break between games.
@mattys123 Looks like the Pies have listened to my feedback from last year &amp; reverted back to having open training at the end of each week.
@roweyandbicks @1395fiveaa He can thank the new MRP system for that. Under the old system, he would have got at least 2 weeks.
@geelongcats He can thank the new MRP system for him not being suspended. The old system would have seen him suspended for at least 2 weeks.
@mattys123 I take it you're into baseball? So am I as I was born in San Fransisco!
@titusoreily Johnson can thank the new system for him not being suspended. Under the old system, he would have been suspended for sure.
@melbtraffic I've always been interested to know why the number on a speed limit sign has a red circle around it.
@melbtraffic I believe there are heavy fines for driving in closed lanes/emergency lanes.
@melbtraffic And I believe there's also an emergency lane on either side, correct?
@afltribunal Under the old system, he would have been suspended for sure.
@melbtraffic Is it a 3, 4 or 5 lane stretch of freeway?
@afltribunal He can thank the changes that came into effect this year for the fact that he hasn't been suspended.
@afl_pkeane He would have been suspended under the old system. The changes that came into effect this year have definitely saved him.
@MelbTraffic A second left lane has now been closed inbound on the Monash Fwy near East Malvern Station for a crash. Delays up to 15minutes.
@paullatter What has been the worst accident you've reported on during your time with the ATN?
@magpie_fans Are closed sessions held at or around the same time of day as open ones?
@Magpie_Fans Looks like the club has listened to my feedback from last year &amp; reverted back to having open training at the end of each week.
Looks like @CollingwoodFC has listened to my feedback from last year &amp; reverted to having open training sessions at the end of each week.
@CollingwoodFC Hi. Glad open training appears to have reverted back to later in the week. Early in the week last year wasn't working for me.
@iamtheoracle Glad open training is back to later in the week. Early in the week last year wasn't working for me.
@vicroads 2/2 vehicle restrictions on Mac Robertsons Bridge. Is this still current or did an error occur when you tried to remove/update it?
@vicroads Although it looks like it's just been cleared in the last 60 seconds. Also, your site still has the traffic alert re heavy 1/2
@melbtraffic Ah, that explains why updates have been less frequent. Thanks for clearing that up. But please post significant disruptions.
@iamtheoracle Closed session probably tomorrow, day off Thursday, then open session probably Friday at around 9:30am or 10am.
@iamtheoracle I say this because confirmation is taking slightly longer than usual. Oh wait, that might due to the public holiday yesterday.
@iamtheoracle Don't think it'll be tomorrow as that's too short notice. Probably Thursday or Friday.
@iamtheoracle Looks like Collingwood's weekly open training session will once again be later in the week as it's yet to be announced.
@aflfeeds @theagesport remain unchanged or does it reset?
@aflfeeds @theagesport 2/2 If you commit a serious offence before the 3 minor offence suspension trigger, does your minor offence count
@aflfeeds @theagesport My question is about the new MRP rules. I know that 3 minor offences will in a season earn you a suspension. 1/2
@MelbTraffic No updates this morning? You seem to have been offline a lot in recent times.

@nationalrailenq This is one of the few times when red triangles on your service indicator don't spell bad news.
@nationalrailenq I don't mind red triangles when they're displayed due to planned works. All other times, they're not a pretty sight!
@nationalrailenq Are these shown as red triangles, yellow triangles or green ticks?
@nationalrailenq Some routes are showing "Major Engineering work is taking place today" on your service indicator. 1/2
@magpie_fans If we're going well, we'll probs take the extra time. If we're going badly, we'll probs rush him back. Happens a lot in footy.
@magpie_fans 2/2 panic and bring them back early.
@magpie_fans Often happens like that. If you're going well, you tend to wait with injured players. If you're going badly, you tend to 1/2
@magpie_fans I suspect how we're travelling might have some influence on whether we take the extra time or bring him back early.
@magpie_fans Although I'd say there's more chance of a complication delaying his return than a quick healing bringing it forward.
@magpie_fans Maxwell's wrist healed in half the time expected, so no reason why Sidebottom's thumb can't do likewise.
@magpie_fans I refuse to give up hope of a quick healing and a return in less time than currently estimated.
@magpie_fans I refuse to give up hope of it healing quickly and an early return. 8 weeks is way too long.
Rats! Sidebottom to have pins inserted into his thumb. Break more serious than first thought. Could be out until as late as June.
@themightypies Although I'm less worried about this now than I would have been last year w/ good draw +kids w/ extra games experience.
@themightypies I'm still not giving up hope of an early return.
@themightypies I refuse to give up hope the broken thumb may heal quicker and reduce it to 3-4 weeks. 8 weeks is way too long.
@magpie_fans You'd think they'd give at least two days' notice when announcing an open training session.
@iamtheoracle You'd think they'd want to give a minimum of two days' notice.
@iamtheoracle I suspect the Pies' open training session will be Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. If it was tomorrow, we'd know by now.
@magpie_fans I suspect this week's open training session will be later in the week. If it was tomorrow, they would have confirmed by now.
@afl I ask because in the ALeague, if you get a red card before you hit the 5 yellow card suspension trigger, your yellow card count resets.
@afl 2/2 suspension, does your minor offence count remain unchanged or does it reset?
@AFL Hi. Quick question re the new MRP rules. If you commit a serious offence before you commit the 3 minor offences that trigger a 1/2
@afl_pkeane I ask because in the ALeague, if you get a red card before the 5 yellow cards for a suspension, your yellow card count resets.
@afl_pkeane 2/2 offence before you commit 3 minor offences, does your minor offence count remain unchanged or does it reset?
@AFL_PKeane Hi. Quick question about the new MRP system. I know 3 minor offences during a season = a suspension. If you commit a serious 1/2
@mattys123 Because in the ALeague, if you get a red card, your yellow card count resets.
@mattys123 I'd be interested to know whether if you commit a more serious offence, does your minor offence count reset or remain unchanged?
@mattys123 The new rules are basically a 3 strike policy, whereby you'll only get suspended if you commit 3 minor offences during a season.
@mattys123 In the AFL, Elliott's been done for tripping, but it's a fine, so it's effectively strike 1 for the season.
@mattys123 Did you think going upstairs for that last try was unnecessary, took too long or both?
@mattys123 Do you ever think the video referee takes slightly longer than necessary?
@mattys123 Is it the background that's green or is the word TRY in green writing?
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No problems to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
. @DebinMelbourne's aunty Wilma has passed away this week at the age of 92. RIP Aunty Wilma.
Puke. Barf. Bleh. 
@mattys123 FYI, the light that gives the umpire the all clear to bounce the ball after a goal is kicked is white. Should be green IMO.
@mattys123 Was Brisbane's late surge last night at the red end or the blue end?
@mattys123 Do all grounds have a red 50m line at one end and a blue 50m line at the other?
@mattys123 The Eagles would be green if you mix their colours together. Blue and yellow make green.
@mattys123 If you mix the Pies' colours together we'd be grey. Do you know what colour the Swans would be if you mix their colours together?
@mattys123 Do they wear a traffic light green?
@mattys123 Is the orange on the Giants the same shade of orange as an orange traffic light?
@mattys123 I'm vision impaired. Of all the teams with red on them, which do you think is the brightest/closest to a red traffic light?
@jodinmelbourne I'm vision impaired. Are the red and orange on the Saints &amp; the Giants the same shades of red &amp; orange as traffic lights?
@magpie_fans How old is she today?
@magpie_fans I'm hoping the broken thumb will heal quicker and it'll only be late April/early May rather than mid May.
@magpie_fans I'm more confident about covering for Sidebottom now than I would have been last year.
@magpie_fans Do you think someone will get done by the MRP for the Rockliff incident or was it an accident?
@_ria84 @boomer_magpies Having said that, I'm more confident now that we can cover the loss than I would have been last year.
@_ria84 @boomer_magpies No, that's too long.
@magpie_fans We may not have kicked a goal in the last quarter, but Brisbane's goals were at long intervals. Defence was much improved.
@_ria84 @boomer_magpies Still, I'm not giving up hope of it healing quickly and being only 2 or 3 weeks rather than 5 or 6.
@boomer_magpies @_ria84 Hearing he might be out for a bit longer than was thought last night. Might be a pretty bad break.
@emtrains This is dragging on far too long and I'm starting to get impatient. ☹
So good to have footy back! Especially with that gutsy win by @CollingwoodFC! That should set us up nicely. #gopies
@rodders05 @_ria84 Maybe just maybe there'll be a miraculous recovery and it won't cost him multiple games.
@mattys123 Still, I'm not prepared to rule him out for multiple games yet.
@mattys123 Hopefully that won't cost him multiple games. I've actually heard of players playing with broken thumbs.
@thedak04 @letsbackbucks @themightypies Hopefully the broken thumb won't cost him multiple games.
@themightypies That should set up our season nicely. Especially given our draw. Round 1 is always the hardest game.
What a brave win by @CollingwoodFC! Interstate, humid conditions, down 2 men &amp; off field dramas. Excellent effort! Should set up the season.
@beclovesthepies That was a brave win tonight, especially given all that went on off the field during the week. Excellent effort.
@letsbackbucks @themightypies That was actually a really gutsy win. Interstate, humid conditions, down 2 men. Great effort.
@mattys123 I thought Brisbane got more goals from their good play than our clangers, which was also a good sign.
@mattys123 I agree. Essendon got run down today after leading by a similar margin, whereas we were able to hold on.
Barf city.
Bleh I wanna barf.
@nationalrailenq Today marks one year since the line through #Dawlish reopened. You should celebrate in some way.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The city loop was closed for 60 minutes due to a trespasser at Southern Cross, but has now reopened. #metrotrains
@metrotrains That ended up taking more than an hour. ☹
@metrotrains This search is taking a while. Then again, that was always on the cards given all lines are affected, so I'm not surprised.
@paullatter Is it a desktop or a laptop?
@themightypies @magpie_fans There's a 95% chance of rain, which should help us.

This will make Good Friday go a lot faster. 
@nationalrailenq Any delays through #Fatherwell? #joke
@mattys123 The pages I've visited so far today would have given just orange and green lights, no red.
@mattys123 Green when working, orange when loading or you're in the log in text field and red for an site error or the wrong log in details.
@mattys123 Did you like my idea of webpages giving green, orange or red lights depending on their status/whether you have to log in?
@mattys123 How long does the red/green light stay up on the board?
@mattys123 What are the vidio ref stats so far in this game with red lights virsus green lights?
@mattys123 Is there an orange light for ref's call or just a red and a green?
@mattys123 Does the vidio ref give an orange light for decision pending/ref's call or just red and green?
@crosscountryuk The old April showers.
@crosscountryuk How's the weather in that neck of the woods today?
@crosscountryuk I can't believe tomorrow marks one year since the line through #Dawlish reopened after those horrendous storms.
2/2 and a red light when there's a problem with the site or you enter the wrong log in details.
I think websites should give a green light when you log on, an orange light when they're loading or you're in a log in text field 1/2
@footytips and a red light when a site error occurs or you enter the wrong log in details.
@footytips I think sites should give a green light when you've logged on, an orange light when they're loading or you're in a log in field
Oh barf. This makes me want to slit my wrists. 
@ptvuser At least on Christmas Day you get presents, spend time with the family and gorge yourself. That makes it go faster.
Good Friday is the slowest day of the year.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No delays or closures to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@danielbowen Oops is right. All clear now.
@crosscountryuk And Saturday marks one year since the line through #Dawlish reopened after those horrendous storms.
@crosscountryuk Today was the original reopening date for the Leamington Spa&gt;Banbury line. Very pleased it reopened 3 weeks early.
@ridotnews Just out of interest, what are school hours in your neck of the woods? I live in Melbourne, where school hours are 9am-3:30pm.
@nationalrailenq Hi. The disruptions that have occurred so far today haven't been appearing on your site. Please fix.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The delays on Citylink and the M1 have now cleared. #melbtraffic
We have a green light! <VERTICAL TRAFFIC LIGHT> The 2015 @AFL season is underway!
Green light. <HORIZONTAL TRAFFIC LIGHT>
CODE GREEN ALERT: Mt Alexander Rd was closed at Fletcher St due to a truck rollover, but has now reopened. No delays there. #melbtraffic
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Delays on Citylink and the M1 are down to 15 minutes. Traffic is now easing quickly. #melbtraffic
@yarratrams Thanks for the regular updates on the Route 59 disruption. Glad you've now been given the green light. Happy Easter!
@yarratrams Hooray! I tipped no earlier than 8pm. Always a bonus when you prepare for the worst and it turns out better than you expect!
*Tries to use Siri ... won't work *Checks settings ... and discovers ... Siri is off! Whoops! *Turns on Siri ... and it works!
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Delays on Citylink and the M1 are down to 30 minutes. Heavy traffic is slowly easing. #melbtraffic
@networkrail Did you know Saturday marks one year since the line through #Dawlish reopened? You should celebrate in some way!
@mattys123 Agree. As mentioned, an orange light would be for when the page is loading or you're in a log in text field.
@mattys123 2/2 field and a red light when the site is down or you enter the wrong log in details.
@mattys123 I think websites should give a green light when you've logged on, an orange light when they're loading or you're in a log in 1/2
@greateranglia What food would be the colour of your current service indicator?
@yarratrams Looks like truck removal efforts in Essendon may have suffered a setback. I'm tipping disruption to extend past 8pm.
@greateranglia Good to see your service indicator is all green.
@phitchener9 @9newsmelb Looks like crews trying to remove the truck have had a setback. Disruption may extend past 8pm.
@yarratrams They're making little to no progress and I'm starting to get impatient.
CODE RED ALERT: Delays now up to 60 minutes in all directions on Citylink and the M1 due to heavy holiday traffic. #melbtraffic
@nationalrailenq Hi. Your site is not updating to reflect the current disruptions. Please fix.
CODE RED ALERT: Delays up to 45 minutes in all directions on Citylink and the M1 due to heavy holiday traffic. #melbtraffic
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Craigieburn line after an earlier bridge strike at Essendon. Services are running ok. #metrotrains
. @metrotrains Glad you got the green light on the Craigieburn line within 25 minutes. A longer closure tonight would have been disastrous!
CODE BLUE ALERT: Craigieburn line trains resumed after a 25 minute suspension due to a bridge strike. Possible 5min delays. #metrotrains
@metrotrains I think it's a miracle that the line was only suspended for 25 minutes. It sounds nasty.
@metrotrains That was quick. I thought the line was going to be closed for hours.
@metrotrains In fact, I'd say disruption is a good chance to continue for the whole of the peak period.
@metrotrains Just read more info about the incident at Essendon. Doesn't sound good. I don't like the chances of a quick resumption.
@metrotrains Hopefully it's not going to take too long for the bridge to be looked at.
CODE RED ALERT: Craigieburn line trains stopped Essendon&gt;Broadmeadows, bridge strike at Essendon. Buses sent. 60min delays. #metrotrains
@mattys123 Still, I'm holding hope he may only miss 6-8 weeks rather than 12.
@mattys123 There's always a chance it could heal quicker than expected, like Maxwell's broken wrist.
@mattys123 Is Greenwood still listed at 6-8 weeks or has that blown out?
@VicRoads For the first time in a long time, your site is showing more Traffic Alert icons than Road Closed icons. Only 5 Road Closed icons.
@afl I believe your office hours are 8am-6pm Monday-Friday during the season and 8am-5pm Monday-Friday during the off-season, correct?
@AFL Hi. I believe your office/reception desk will be closed from 6pm tonight until 8am Tuesday, correct?
@footytips I mean for games later in the round. You could do that if there was a last minute team change etc.
@footytips I believe you can edit your tips after submitting, correct?
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are all clear at this time. No delays or closures to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
A very happy Easter to @metrotrains, @VicRoads, @GettrafficVic, @MelbTraffic, @CityLinkMelb &amp;  @VictoriaPolice! Thanks for all your updates!
. @metrotrains Hi. Just wanted to say thanks for the regular updates on the Glenhuntly incident yesterday &amp; also to wish you a happy Easter!
Works affecting the Burnley group this weekend. Please see below for details. 
@adamtabsports @white_adam Same with @CollingwoodFC. Horror run with injuries &amp; a bad draw last year. Easier draw &amp; less injuries this year.
@nationalrailenq That's a good result. The line was expected to be closed for at least another 60 minutes.
@the_rail_life Maybe they could turn the faulty components into Easter eggs so people could eat them! #AprilFools
@the_rail_life @theage They had all sorts of problems getting a rail grinder for the Bairnsdale line which made it take a lot longer.
@themightypies @collingwoodfc Especially if it rains. We seem to like the wet.
STAT: @CollingwoodFC are undefeated on Easter weekend since 2009. Can they keep it going in 2015? #gopies
@the_rail_life @theage Can we categorically rule out a reopening before my 28th birthday? That happens at 8:30am on Saturday 2 May.
@the_rail_life @theage Realistically, what would be the best case scenario?
@metrotrains Hearing reports this evening that the Stony Point line may be out for weeks at best, possibly months.
@the_rail_life @theage Do you think it'll be as long as the Bairnsdale line in 2013? That was 7 months.
@the_rail_life @theage What would be the earliest trains could be expected to run?
@the_rail_life @theage Sounds like it could be weeks, maybe months.
@nightwatchman Lol that's a good one!
Oh barf. Here we go again. 
@nationalrailenq Was there a stain on the signals?
@the_rail_life I said as an April Fools joke that the disruption at Glenhuntly today was a truck losing its load of chocolate icecream.
@the_rail_life Same as V/Line trains, sans Frankston.
@mattys123 @ossienet @stephenc24 I'm vision impaired. What colour category is each injured player currently?
@melbtraffic Okay. Thanks anyway.
@melbtraffic Where do you get the travel time information from? Could you please tweet me a link to the relevant site?
@the_rail_life Which lines are also shared by freight trains?
@MelbTraffic I suspect they're all minor ones.
@the_rail_life How many crossings in Melbourne are used by trams? I know there's Glenhuntly, Riversdale and Kooyong. Any others?
@the_rail_life An incident at a level crossing which is also used by trams is a recipe for code red level disruption.
@melbtraffic These are all collisions, correct?
@the_rail_life It would have been pretty scary for the passengers, and also extremely disruptive.
Rudy the giant German Shepherd turns three today! Happy birthday you big unit!
@the_rail_life Do you think there would have been a loud crash when the tram derailed?
@nationalrailenq As delays are now only 10 minutes, I think that's short enough to change the red triangle to yellow.
@themightypies @magpie_fans @mattys123 That happens a lot in NAB Challenges. Teams put the cue in the rack when they know they're beaten.
@mattys123 @magpie_fans @themightypies Agree. Can't see a repeat of last August. Memories of that night make me want to barf.
@themightypies @magpie_fans @mattys123 I'm worried about the Lions' pace virsus ours. They caused us all manner of problems last August.
@mattys123 @magpie_fans Or at the very worst, not have a heavy defeat that hurts our percentage and walk away injury free.
@The_Rail_Life Was anyone hurt when that tram derailed at Glenhuntly this morning?
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@nationalrailenq In fact, that was the only long term disruption you had all winter. Massive improvement on last winter.
@nationalrailenq They did extremely well. Major repairs are rarely completed that far ahead of schedule, and many of them suffer setbacks.
@richmond_fc @maddyashhh Why was today's session 30 minutes earlier than all other sessions scheduled for Melbourne this year?
@translinkseq Delays are slowly receding and it's now displaying on your site as an orange triangle rather than a red circle.
@nationalrailenq Tomorrow was the original estimated reopening date for the line between Leamington Spa and Banbury.
CODE PINK ALERT: Things will be screwed up due to howling gales. Fallen trees will close many roads &amp; train lines. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@nationalrailenq Will you be using pink on your service indicator today or will you be sticking with red, yellow and green?
@nationalrailenq Is this one a red triangle, a yellow triangle or a pink diamond for a joke?
@nationalrailenq Is this disruption displayed as a red triangle, a yellow triangle or a pink diamond as an April Fools joke?
@unitedenergyau It's pretty windy out there today.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now after an earlier truck breakdown in the Burnley Tunnel. Traffic is back to normal levels. #melbtraffic
@unitedenergyau Is this an April Fools joke or is it true?
@nationalrailenq Is this an April Fools joke or is it true?
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Delays are down to 15 minutes after an earlier truck breakdown in the Burnley Tunnel. #melbtraffic
Slow Wifi makes me wanna slit my wrists.
@MelbTraffic Good to hear from you after you were offline this morning.
@CollingwoodFC Hi. Who is responsible for arranging the dates &amp; times for open training each week? Is it the footy department or the coach?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: All lanes now open in the Burnley Tunnel after an earlier truck breakdown. Still delays up to 25 minutes. #melbtraffic
@iamtheoracle I hope weekly open training will revert back to later in the week. Early in the week last year just didn't feel quite right.
@iamtheoracle Did the Pies have their main training session this morning?
@lukey_15 @themightypies That might be to our advantage because it'll make it difficult for the Lions to run and spread like last August.
@CityLinkMelb What's this about a truck breakdown in the Burnley Tunnel? Is it an April Fools joke or is it true?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Centre lane closed in Burnley Tunnel due to a truck breakdown. Heavy haulage required. Delays up to 25mins. #melbtraffic
@citylinkmelb @gettrafficvic So that probably means the truck might be there for an hour or more.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Centre lane closed in the Burnley Tunnel due to a truck breakdown. Delays up to 15 minutes. #melbtraffic
CODE PINK ALERT: The Burnley Tunnel is screwed up because a truck has rolled and is leaking lemonade. #melbtraffic
. @VicRoads Hi. The derailed tram in Glenhuntly has now been cleared.
Full marks to @metrotrains for providing regular and detailed updates during the disruption at Glenhuntly.
@metrotrains @yarratrams Do you think a loud crash would have been heard when the tram derailed?
CODE GREEN ALERT: Frankston line reopened Caulfield&gt;Moorabbin after a tram derailment at Glenhuntly. No delays expected. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Just heard from @yarratrams that trams have resumed at Glenhuntly, so trains should also be resuming about now.
@yarratrams That took a heck of a long time. Then again, that was always on the cards given the type of disruption, so I'm not surprised.
CODE PINK ALERT: The screwup on the Frankston line will last until 8am next Thursday. I did warn you about crews being away. #metrotrains
CODE RED ALERT: Major disruption on the Frankston line due to a tram derailment. Details below. 
@metrotrains But again, thanks for the constant updates as the situation has changed. They've been very helpful. Keep up the good work!
@metrotrains As I said before, I always thought reopening within 60 minutes of the incident occurring was slightly optimistic.
@metrotrains Ah, now I see why it keeps being pushed back. There must have been some damage to the track.
@metrotrains Rats! You were so close to reopening it and now it's been pushed back at the last minute.
@metrotrains I just want to say that your constant updates on the Frankston line disruption have been extremely helpful. Thanks a lot.
@metrotrains I always thought your aim to have it cleared in 60 minutes was a tad optimistic. I'm now thinking sometime after 1pm.
@metrotrains I'm starting to get a feeling the closed section of the Frankston line may not reopen until after lunchtime.
At least it gives you a good excuse to eat icecream. #metrotrains
CODE PINK ALERT: The Frankston line is screwed up because a truck has spilt its load of chocolate icecream onto the tracks at Glenhuntly.
@metrotrains Hey, maybe you could make light of it by using pink icons on your healthboard!
@metrotrains What's this about a derailed tram at Glenhuntly? Is it an April Fools joke or is it true?
CODE PINK ALERT: Everything's ok now, but everyone's away, so if anything goes wrong, you're screwed. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@vline_seymour Are you playing an April Fools joke or is this true?
@TransLinkSEQ Is this an April Fools joke or is it true?
@metrotrains So it might not be until after Easter? <PENSIVE FACE>
@metrotrains Hi guys, just wondering when you might have the Stony Point line fixed. It's been down for two days. That's unacceptable.
@paullatter Is this an April Fools joke or is it true?
6 people followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
CODE GREEN ALERT: Just a reminder that the Belgrave/Lilydale line is now all clear from earlier downed wires at Heatherdale. #metrotrains
@ridotnews I'm vision impaired. What happens with traffic lights when they malfunction?
@metrotrains I'd all but given up hope of trains resuming tonight. Downed wires usually take a minimum of 6 hours, sometimes longer.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Trains have resumed between Blackburn and Ringwood after earlier downed wires at Heatherdale. No delays. #metrotrains
I heard reports that the disruption at Heatherdale should be resolved around 10pm or 11pm but @metrotrains are being rather tight lipped.
@mattys123 @_ria84 Memories of that game make me want to puke.
@mattys123 @_ria84 It'll make it more difficult for them to cut us up through the middle like they did last year.
@metrotrains Now hearing reports the downed wires at Heatherdale should be fixed around 10pm. That's better than I thought.
The downed wires are located at Heatherdale. This may increase your journey by up to 40 minutes. #metrotrains
CODE RED ALERT: Buses now only expected to run Blackburn&gt;Ringwood until 10pm rather than end of service due to downed wires. 1/2
@the_rail_life Hey, maybe the maintenance staff should wear pink tomorrow as an April Fools joke! Or will they be sticking with orange?
@the_rail_life That's better than I thought. Lots of bright orange jackets around I bet.
@The_Rail_Life It seems highly unlikely that the overheads at Heatherdale Station will be fixed before service finishes tonight.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the M1 after multiple incidents and severe delays. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@metrotrains It seems pretty clear to me that the fault won't be fixed before service finishes tonight. Please put this info on your site.
2/2 This may increase your journey by up to 40 minutes. #metrotrains
CODE BLACK ALERT: Buses likely to run Blackburn&gt;Ringwood for the rest of the night due to downed wires at Heatherdale. 1/2
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Wow. Today marks one year since the #HastingsLine reopened after being postponed 4 times.
Trying to find out from @metrotrains if the overhead wires at Heatherdale will be fixed tonight but they're not responding. #frustrating
@trainspotter67 I know. But I wanted to make a joke about this disruption because it will most likely be fixed before tomorrow.
@trainspotter67 That was a joke.
CODE PINK ALERT: Heatherdale screwup will last at least 7 days. Crews on holiday until 9am Tuesday. There go your Easter plans. #metrotrains
@the_rail_life Is it more likely to be fixed later this evening or early tomorrow morning?
@The_Rail_Life What's going on at Heatherdale Station? Is it just a power outage or have the overhead wires fallen to the ground?
@faustus_socinus Trying to find out from @metrotrains if it's damaged wires or just a loss of power but they're being rather tight lipped.
@faustus_socinus It's all thanks to a power outage at Heatherdale which may not be fixed until late tonight or tomorrow morning.
CODE RED ALERT: All incidents on the M1 have now cleared, but there are delays up to 90 minutes. Avoid area/delay your trip. #melbtraffic
@metrotrains Urgh. There doesn't seem to be any progress. I'm starting to think it may not be fixed before service finishes tonight.
@iamtheoracle Then next week we'll probably train Monday, Wednesday and Friday and then the game Saturday.
@iamtheoracle So just to confirm, our main training session is tomorrow, day off Thursday, then fly to Brisbane and train Friday, correct?
@Magpie_Fans Is our main training session this week tomorrow or Thursday, and at what time?
2/2 at heatherdale. Outage not expected to be fixed before 8pm. Journey times may increase by up to 50 minutes. #metrotrains
CODE RED ALERT: Select services now running the full length of the line but buses still running Blackburn&gt;Ringwood due to power outage 1/2
@VenturaBus Looks like the Ringwood line disruption may last for a good part of this evening, so expect some disruption to your services.
@3aw693 And I'd say there's a good chance the line may not be back up and running until the morning.
@metrotrains Sounds like the overhead wires may have been badly damaged or come down. Is this true? If so, it may take until the morning.
2/2 Journey times may increase by up to 45 minutes. #metrotrains
CODE RED ALERT: Buses running Blackburn&gt;Ringwood due to power outage at Heatherdale. Not expected to be fixed before 7pm. 1/2
@metrotrains Are you thinking the issue at Heatherdale will be fixed in the next 1 to 2 hours or do you think it'll take most of the night?
CODE RED ALERT: Delays up to 60 minutes in both directions on the M1 due to multiple incidents. Avoid area or delay your trip. #melbtraffic
@MFB_News Good to see you were able to fix the diesel leak on Collins Street and reopen the road in time for the PM peak.
@melbtraffic But there is some good news, the section of Collins Street that was closed for 2 hours due to a diesel leak has just reopened.
@magpie_fans So all hope is not lost for Thomas and Keeffe.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Collins Street has reopened near Exibition Street after an earlier diesel leak. There are no delays. #melbtraffic
@magpie_fans Has there ever been a case of a positive A sample but a negative B sample?
@magpie_fans When do you think the B samples will be out?
@venturabus This is due to an overhead power outage on the line, so it may take some time to repair. Ping @metrotrains
@metrotrains And because it's an overhead power failure, I'd say it's almost certain to last right through the PM peak.
@iamtheoracle Having open training later in the week and also allowing fans who live interstate to see the players train is a great concept.
@iamtheoracle 2/2 I hope this continues through the year. Last year all sessions were in Melbourne and were early in the week.
@iamtheoracle I like open training being later in the week and also the fact that fans who live in Brisbane will get to see us train. 1/2
@iamtheoracle At what time (roughly)?
@iamtheoracle Collingwood has a light open training session at the Gabba on Friday. When is the main closed session in Melbourne this week?
@CollingwoodFC Hi. Your site hasn't been updated to reflect the next open training session at the Gabba on Friday. Please update/fix.
@mfb_news I'm starting to think the chances of a resolution and reopening before the PM peak are fairly slim.
CODE RED ALERT: Collins St closed near Exhibition St due to diesel leak (now contained). 30 minute delays through diversions. #melbtraffic
@mfb_news I certainly hope this can be resolved before the afternoon peak period starts, otherwise delays will be horrendous!
@metrotrains Hi Metro, are you expecting to have the Stony Point line back running later today or do you think it'll take until tomorrow?
@footytips I tried Firefox and it works perfectly. I also just downloaded the iPhone app. Thanks for your help.
@footytips I'm using IE 7. It was working fine yesterday morning, but the problem started last night and continues this morning.
@footytips Just to confirm, I can't access your site from Internet Explorer. Please fix urgently as the season starts on Thursday.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are all clear at present. No disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@footytips Hi guys, trying to log on to your mobile site using Internet Explorer and I'm getting a "Website Restore Error". Please fix.
@ptvuser There's never a good time for this to happen, but there are definitely worse times than this.
@ptvuser According to @emgw_melbourne, it sounds like it might be at Mont Albert. Will prob be closed for rest of night given it's after 11.
@ptvuser @metrotrains At which station is the incident? Canterbury Station is an 8 minute walk from my house.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail I'm very pleased you got through winter with only one long term disruption as compared with 8 last winter.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail 2/2 And Saturday marks one year since the line through #Dawlish reopened.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail A couple of milestones coming up. Tomorrow marks one year since the #HastingsLine reopened. 1/2
Oh barf.
@metrotrains How much extra time will this add to the journey? About 25 minutes?
@1Out1Back Hi. I'm vision impaired. In harness racing, is there a green light to signal all clear and a red/orange light for no all clear?
. @metrotrains The Stony Point line is having a bad run. Lots of track and signal faults in recent weeks.
@haydsant If you don't have the Metro Notify app, I strongly recommend you download it. It's a very helpful app.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Monash Freeway after two earlier accidents. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@CollingwoodFC Hi. Your site still shows next training session as Monday 16 March. Please update.
@harrypotter6116 Perhaps we'll go in a bit harder with the changes to the system. So will every other club.
@harrypotter6116 2/2 that we're just playing fair?
@harrypotter6116 Does the fact that Collingwood's suspension rate has been so low in recent years mean we're not going hard enough or 1/2
@harrypotter6116 I felt players were getting too careful when they had points against them for fear they'd get suspended.
@harrypotter6116 I also like the new MRP and Tribunal system. This will probably lead to a fall in the suspension rate.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: All inbound lanes now open on the Monash Freeway after two earlier crashes. Still delays up to 25 minutes. #melbtraffic
@harrypotter6116 I'm happy with the 2015 fixture as a whole. The AFL have definitely acknowledged that they got it horribly wrong last year.
@harrypotter6116 And it looks like Thursday night footy is going to increase with the new TV deal.
@melbtraffic @paullatter That should be Western Ring Road. #typo
@harrypotter6116 Also it doesn't clash with the NRL on Monday nights. If you're gonna have footy on a weeknight, Thursday's the way to go.
@harrypotter6116 I agree. Sunday and Monday night footy was an epic fail. I quite like Thursday night footy though.
@harrypotter6116 I can't believe they put Collingwood V Carlton on a Sunday night in the middle of winter. Thursday night would have been ok
@harrypotter6116 I'm a lot happier with our draw this year than I was last year.
@haydsant There was an ill passenger at Nth Melb this morning. If you have Metro Notify, it would have given you an orange notification.
@HaydSant Did you get caught up in those delays caused by the fatality at Craigieburn last Monday?
@metrotrains Hey, maybe you should use pink icons on your healthboard on Wednesday as an April Fools joke!
@harrypotter6116 Also, our VFL side beat Richmond by 118 points last Thursday.
@harrypotter6116 We did beat Hawthorn in the NAB Challenge on a Thursday night.
@harrypotter6116 2/2 Which fellow Victorian team would you like to see Collingwood play on a Thursday night?
@harrypotter6116 I'd love to see Collingwood play another Victorian team on a Thursday night sometime in future. That would be great. 1/2
@metrotrains Also, I believe all Burnley group lines will be yellow this weekend, correct?
@metrotrains Ok fair enough. If any other services had been affected, it would have been orange. Makes sense now.
@harrypotter6116 Hi there! What are your plans for Easter? I'll be visiting my grandparents up in Malmsbury and gorging myself on chocolate.
. @metrotrains Hi Metro, what's the reason for the 15 minute delay on the 8:47 Moorabbin&gt;FSS? Also, should be orange on your site, not blue.
CODE RED ALERT: Right lane closed inbound on Monash Fwy from Toorak Rd to Domain Tunnel due to 2 crashes. Delays up to 60mins. #melbtraffic
Excellent all-round performance by @CricketAus to win the 2015 @cricketworldcup. Never gave @blackcaps a look in.
@cretters Hi there! What are your plans for Easter?
@Davis_Harr Hi there! Any plans for Easter?
Excellent bowling and fielding by @CricketAus to restrict @blackcaps to 183. Never let them escape, even during the Taylor-Elliott p-ship.

@JimmyTraffic Hodel St was closed southbound at Langridge St for 60 minutes due to a car rollover, but has now reopened. Huge relief.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Hodel St reopened southbound at Langridge St after an earlier car rollover. Still delays up to 20 minutes. #melbtraffic
@MelbTraffic @MCG Hodel Street has just reopened southbound at Langridge Street after an earlier car rollover. Big relief.
CODE RED ALERT: Hodel St closed southbound at Langridge St due to a car rollover. Delays of at least 30mins through diversions. #melbtraffic
@mcg I think it's totally blocked off.
@melbtraffic @cricketaus @mcg It's a car rollover, so it might be a while.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are all clear at this time. No disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: The delays caused by an earlier accident on the Bolte Bridge have now cleared. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic

@bythemincricket That was totally the wrong decision. Bet he makes a hundred and India win.
@iamtheoracle Wrong decision. I'd stop the game and demand it be corrected.
@davis_harr No, wrong decision. That'll cost us a lot of runs.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Delays are down to 8 minutes and receding quickly after an earlier truck breakdown in the Burnley Tunnel. #melbtraffic
@citylinkmelb Which lanes will be closed, and from what time?
@vflpies Just out of interest, what was the reason that this match is being played on a Thursday?
@harrypotter6116 Having said that, no team has ever chased down a score of more than 300 batting second at the SCG.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: All lanes now open in the Burnley Tunnel after an earlier truck breakdown but still delays up to 25 minutes. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic Just checked the #victraffic website and after doing so, I'd advise motorists to allow an extra 25 minutes travel time.
@melbtraffic What colours are displaying on the cameras?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Left lane closed in the Burnley Tunnel due to a truck breakdown. Delays up to 25 minutes. #melbtraffic
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Cranbourne, Pakenham and Frankston lines after an earlier medical emergency at Malvern. #metrotrains
. @metrotrains That woman involved in the incident at Malvern needs a lotto ticket. That could easily have been a lot worse.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: All lines through Malvern have reopened following a medical emergency, but still delays up to 15 minutes. #metrotrains
@metrotrains How much longer at Malvern? Surely all tracks should be opening about now. It's taken well over an hour.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Still 20min delays on Cranbourne/Pakenham/Frankston lines due med. emerg. at Malvern. 2 of 4 lines closed. #metrotrains
@metrotrains Hi Metro, which line or lines will have yellow icons displayed on your healthboard over the Easter long weekend?
Works affecting multiple lines this weekend. Please see below for full info. 
@3aw693 The woman is extremely lucky to be alive.
@kristymayr7 @7newsmelbourne She's very lucky to be alive.
@melbtraffic You missed the peak period (again). Why is this happening so often?

@themightypies @collingwoodfc Great to see Sharinberg is ahead of schedule and won't miss as much footy as first thought.
@themightypies I'm not setting my expectations too high, but I'm reasonably confident about the coming season given the better draw.
@themightypies Yeah I think 7th sounds about right. But then again, there's always that one club who always exceeds expectations.
@themightypies I'm vision impaired so the pic is of no use to me. Where does it have us on the ladder?
@nationalrailenq Although delays are on the way down rather than on the way up.
@themightypies @magpie_fans It's true. We've got more guys in full training now than we did last March, so on the whole, we're looking ok.
@collingwoodfc Just noticed Moore's toe has been given the green light as well. Which toe on which foot was it?
@collingwoodfc Wow. Busy day in Pie land tomorrow with open training at 9:45am as well.
@collingwoodfc What time is bouncedown?
Well done to the @Bushrangers. After a poor day yesterday, they bounce back to hold on for a draw and win the 2014/15 #SheffieldShild.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Just a reminder that the closures from a serious truck crash on the Monash Freeway this morning are now gone. #melbtraffic
@crosscountryuk 48 hours of disruption is a lot better than 6 weeks.
@crosscountryuk That disruption was nothing of the scale of the disruption caused by the land slip between Leamington Spa and Banbury.
@craigsta9010 The rain alert level for the cricket in Sydney tomorrow and in Melbourne on Sunday is Code Green.
@craigsta9010 I'm just thankful noone was killed and it's back to a code green alert.
@craigsta9010 It was a massive code red alert!
@craigsta9010 It was closed in both directions at one stage.
. @VicRoads So just to clarify, how long was the Monash Fwy closed inbound at Warrigal Rd, and how long was it closed outbound?
@craigsta9010 At least the Monash Freeway is back open. It reopened ahead of schedule at around 12pm. Was expected to be closed until 2pm.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The Monash Freeway has fully reopened at Warrigal Rd after a serious truck crash this morning. Traffic is ok. #melbtraffic
@MelbTraffic Was just in a cab heading eastbound on Burke Rd. Traffic is shocking b/t Whitehorse  Rd&gt;Canterbury Rd. Delays up to 20 minutes.
@craigsta9010 Was just in a cab on Burke Rd heading eastbound. Shocking b/t Whitehors Rd&gt;Canterbury Rd. Delays up to 20 minutes.
Signing off now as I have a band rehearsal. I'll have an update on the Monash Freeway when I return around 4pm. #melbtraffic
@iamtheoracle We're being batted right out of contension.
@ambulancevic Hearing the freeway may be closed for up to 6 hours. I'm just thankful noone was killed.
CODE RED ALERT: Monash Fwy clsd IB at Warrigal Rd until at least 2pm, serious truck acc. RHL also clsd OB. 60min delays. Avoid. #melbtraffic
@citylinkmelb @gettrafficvic @vicroads Hearing reports the Freeway could be closed for up to 6 hours.
@jimmytraffic Hopefully the cleanup can gain some momentum and at least one or two lanes can open up earlier.
@jimmytraffic What? 2pm? That's ridiculous!
@jimmytraffic I'd say there's a good chance it may be closed until after lunchtime.
@melbtraffic @7newsmelbourne @9newsaus @abcnews24 @paullatter @tennewsmelb Hearing it may be closed for up to 4 hours, maybe even longer.
@jimmytraffic Fatal?
@iamtheoracle 40 runs isn't a big deficit, but it shouldn't have been a deficit at all. Then we bowled absolute rubbish. I'd say we're gone.
@jimmytraffic @mmmhotbreakfast @tennewsmelb Hoping only a brief closure but tipping it'll be at least 120 minutes.
@iamtheoracle Bad batting meant we had a deficit which put the bowlers under pressure and they cracked and bowled really poorly.
@bhogleharsha Just a shame the rain cost us 90 minutes.
@trainlinknorth That's a good result. Derailments can close lines for days.
ALERT: The technical fault that affected the @metrotrains website earlier this evening has now been fixed. The information is correct.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All outbound lanes now open on Citylink at Footscray Rd after a crash. Delays have cleared and traffic is ok. #melbtraffic
@bradqmelb @citylinkmelb A truck and trailer rolled, which usually takes a few hours.
ALERT: The @metrotrains website is currently displaying the wrong information due to a technical fault. Resolution may take a few hours.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Outbound delays on Hodel Street and Punt Road have now cleared. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@adelaidemetrosa That was quick.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Eastbound delays on the Eastern, Monash and West Gate Freeways have now cleared. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@metrotrains Thanks. Hopefully it takes minutes to fix rather than hours.
@metrotrains Will this affect Metro Notify?
CODE RED ALERT: Two LHL still closed OB on Citylink at Footscray Rd due to a crash. A truck has rolled. 60min delays. Avoid. #melbtraffic
CODE RED ALERT: Two left lanes closed outbound on Citylink at Footscray Road due to a crash. Delays already over 30 minutes. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic These stoppages are happening a little too often for my liking. I hope you can sort things out soon.
@citylinkmelb Which two lanes are closed?
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Delays up to 30 minutes eastbound on the Eastern, Monash and West Gate Freeways due to heavy traffic. #melbtraffic
CODE RED ALERT: Delays up to 40 minutes outbound on Hodel Street and Punt Road due to heavy traffic. #melbtraffic
@cricketworldcup @wwos9 And yet the resumption is still 15 minutes away. Too long for my liking.
@blackcaps @officialcsa They should really be resuming now, or at least in the next 5 minutes. 15 minutes is a bit too long.
@bythemincricket I'd estimate it'll be at least another 15 minutes.
@bythemincricket That rain stuck around a lot longer than expected, and because of that, it'll take longer for the ground to dry.
@bythemincricket Given it's a tricky one to assess, I'd say there'll be a lot of pondering before anything happens. I'd say at least 30mins.
@innobystander @cwcwatch Problem is, it stuck around a lot longer than expected and has cost us a substantial number of overs.
@farhan93_ You're right. In a way, I almost hope it rains all night so SA can have their full 50 overs.
@themightypies Also need to get better at locking the ball in our forward line after we kick a behind.
@themightypies Because when he's not taking marks, it's getting rebounded out of our forward line way too easily.
@bythemincricket That is, SA will have a full 50 overs and will start from their current score.
@bythemincricket Although if it rains for the rest of the evening, no overs will be lost tomorrow.
@themightypies I also think Travis Cloke will need some help up forward this year. He can't do all the work himself.
@bythemincricket Rats! Looks like what was expected to be a short delay might turn into a very, very long one.
@themightypies He's definitely become a key part of our at times leaky defence.
@bhogleharsha This rain is taking a lot longer to pass than expected.
@themightypies Will that restrict his ability to play for the senior side?
@bythemincricket I'm not optimistic of a restart anytime soon, because once the rain stops, it'll probably be an extra 15-30mins after that.
@bythemincricket There's clearer weather ahead, but it's taking its time to arrive. Overs will be lost for sure.
@bythemincricket Maybe just maybe it'll blow away and we won't lose overs.
@blackcaps @cricketworldcup This has been a longer delay than expected, and I'd say it still has at least another 30 minutes to run.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@hatraffic_seast That didn't take long.
@bushrangers Rats! Worst possible time for that to happen. Now we're almost certainly looking at a first innings deficit.
@bythemincricket We've seen through this tournament how costly dropped catches can be. Always a relief when it doesn't cost too much.
@bythemincricket Always nice when you drop a catch but the wicket comes pretty quickly thereafter.
@bushrangers And now we're out of recognised batsmen. This means we could be facing a substantial first innings deficit.
@vicroads Okay. Thanks for fixing that up.
@vicroads I believe this incident has well and truly cleared and and error occurred when you tried to update it. Please fix.
@bushrangers That's a wrong decision. That could put us in real jeopardy.
@magpie_fans Greenwood's injury is nothing of that scale.
@magpie_fans I remember those gruesome injuries suffered by Nathan Brown (Richmond), Nathan Bock and Garry Rohan.
@magpie_fans Exactly. Not great, but not the worst possible result. A complete break probably would have ended his season.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The truck breakdown on the Monash Freeway near Warrigal Road has now been cleared. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@magpie_fans So based on that, I don't think an early return for Greenwood can be totally ruled out.
@magpie_fans For example, when Maxwell broke his wrist, he was due to miss 8 weeks, but it healed quicker than expected, reducing it to 4.
@Magpie_Fans As bad as it looks for Greenwood, there's always a chance the bone could heal quicker than expected. That can happen.
@collingwoodfc @foxfootylive @luke_h10 So on that basis, I don't think a return for Greenwood in less than 6 weeks can be totally ruled out.
@collingwoodfc @foxfootylive @luke_h10 For example, Maxwell in 2013. His wrist healed quicker than expected, reducing it from 8 weeks to 4.
@luke_h10 @collingwoodfc @foxfootylive I don't think it'll be 12. Probably 6-8, maybe less if the bone heals really well, as can happen.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Tulla Freeway after an earlier accident at English Street. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@cricketaus And there's no more rain forecast for the rest of the match, so that's a green light for cricket!
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Pakenham line after an earlier police request. Services are back to normal. #metrotrains
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Left lane blocked outbound on the Monash Fwy near Warrigal Rd due to a truck breakdown. Delays up to 10mins. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic It's a truck breakdown. Left lane blocked as a result.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Accident on the Tullamarine  Freeway at English Street now cleared but delays up to 25 minutes remain. #melbtraffic
@foxfootylive @collingwoodfc I think that might be optimistic. I'd say it'll be 8 or more.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Pakenham line services between Dandenong and Pakenham are delayed up to 8 minutes due to a police request. #metrotrains
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Two right lanes closed outbound on the Tulla Fwy at English Street due to a crash. Delays up to 30 minutes. #melbtraffic
@magpie_fans @themightypies As they say, it's much better to make a long mistake than a short mistake.
@magpie_fans @themightypies At least if we turn it over on a quick play, they can't get so many numbers back so more chance to recover.
@themightypies @magpie_fans I also get nervous when we move the ball slow because we're ripe for getting scored against if we turn it over.
@magpie_fans @themightypies Still concerns with our defence when the opposition move the ball quickly. Coast-to-coast goals really hurt.
@magpie_fans @themightypies It's very rare that you lose by 10 goals one week and win by 10 goals the next.
@magpie_fans @themightypies A percentage hit like that is always hard to recover from.
@themightypies @magpie_fans Those games stood out as ones we should have won by more, especially after the Round 1 debacle.
@magpie_fans That's also true. I think we'll definitely improve this year, especially with a better draw.
@magpie_fans That's true, but there were several games we could have won by bigger margins but for last quarter fadeouts.
@magpie_fans I'd hate for us to have a heavy defeat in Round 1 like last year. We never really recovered as far as percentage was concerned.
@magpie_fans It'll be an interesting race between Reid, Young and Greenwood as to who returns first.
@magpie_fans As I said, having one of the VFL practice matches cancelled didn't help him.
@magpie_fans Holding him back until Round 3 might not be the worst thing given how much footy he's missed. Needs to get his confidence back.
@magpie_fans As mentioned, I think the cancellation of the VFL practice match against Essendon pushed his return back a week.
@magpie_fans It also occurred to me that the cancellation of one of our VFL practice matches may have had a baring on his return date.
@magpie_fans And given the amount of footy he's missed, another couple of games in the VFL wouldn't hurt.
@magpie_fans Perhaps the plan was always to save him for Round 2 or 3 but they didn't let on.
@magpie_fans Same thing with Beams in 2013. I'm pretty sure he tore his quad and was always looking at a long layoff and they didn't own up.
@magpie_fans I was disappointed that they didn't own up last year when he damaged a tendon in his calf, which usually means multiple weeks.
@magpie_fans Are you thinking he's torn a muscle and is looking at multiple weeks and they're refusing to own up to it?
@magpie_fans He hasn't been officially ruled out just yet, and reports are there's no fresh injury, just management.
@magpie_fans Sometimes flying can cause your muscles to stiffen up. If we were in Melbourne, it wouldn't be a problem.
@magpie_fans I suspect the fact that we're away in Round 1 is part of the reason Ben Reid has all but been ruled out.
Rats! Double blow for @CollingwoodFC with Levi Greenwood (ankle) out until at least mid May and now Ben Reid all but ruled out of Round One.
Ben Cousins is one banana short of a bunch.
@davis_harr If it's washed out and there's no reserve day, who goes through?
Wifi dropouts make me want to slit my wrists.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All previous delays on the West Gate Freeway &amp; West Gate Bridge have now cleared. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
@joffacorfe A hairline fracture is not the worst result. A complete break would have ended his season. At least Reid seems to be ok.
@themightypies A hairline fracture for Greenwood is not the worst result. A complete break probably would have ended his season.
@themightypies BREAKING: Greenwood out for 6 weeks. I guess it's better than 3 months.
@magpie_fans Not great, but I thought it might have been 8 to 12. What about Reid?
Anyone having trouble with the Metro Notify app? It's not opening on my phone when I go to view a push notification. Ping @metrotrains
@nationalrailenq Good to see no red triangles. Just a few yellow ones, and lots of green ticks!
CODE YELLOW ALERT: 15min delays OB on West Gate Fwy due to earlier crash at Grieve Pde+earlier breakdown on West Gate Bridge. #melbtraffic
@melbtraffic Looks like there's about a 15 minute delay behind it.
@melbtraffic The left lane was briefly closed outbound on the West Gate Bridge due to a breakdown, but this has now cleared.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Left lane closed outbound on the West Gate Bridge due to a breakdown. Delays up to 20 minutes. #melbtraffic
@themightypies I'm really disappointed that the club hasn't been upfront with their supporters about our injuries in the last 3 years.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Crash on the West Gate Freeway at Grieve Parade has now cleared but still delays of up to 20 minutes. #melbtraffic
@cricketaus I'd say the chances of any more play tonight are fairly slim. Having said that, we got a lot more play today than was forecast.
@themightypies Still no official update from the club on Greenwood, but Eddie thinks he's looking at 8 to 12 weeks.
@nationalrailenq What food would be the colour of the triangle displayed on your service indicator for this disruption?
@bushrangers I'd say we might be lucky to get back on at all tonight. Having said that, we got a lot more play today than I expected.
@wacamd I've got a bad feeling that might be it for the day. If so, that just about puts WA out of contension.
@jimmytraffic @tennewsmelb The Caulder Freeway reopened a lot sooner than I expected.
@MelbTraffic The Caulder Freeway has just reopened inbound at Gap Road after an earlier crash. A lot quicker than I expected.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Left lane closed outbound on the West Gate Freeway at Grieve Parade due to a crash. Delays up to 20 minutes. #melbtraffic
@jimmytraffic @tennewsmelb I'm tipping it may be closed for a number of hours.
@bradqmelb @9newsaus @9newsmelb I'm tipping it may be closed for quite a few hours.

@metrotrains This is taking longer than usual.
@craigsta9010 I really wish they'd provide an update. Their silence is unacceptable in my book.
@vicroads Which lane is the one that's closed? Always handy to know which lane is closed.
@wacamd I think the 30 minute delay is slightly excessive. I would have thought 15 minutes would have been enough.
@bushrangers I think a 30 minute delay is slightly excessive. 15 minutes really should be enough.
@wacamd An extended delay wouldn't help WA either as they need to win to claim the title.
@wacamd Sometimes I think they're a bit too precious and it results in a longer delay than necessary.
@wacamd Well they're taking too long for my liking. They need to be told to hurry up.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The delays on the Cranbourne, Pakenham and Glen Waverley lines have now cleared. Services are back to normal. #metrotrains
@daniellonergan So even with no further rain, I'd say we're looking at a fairly substantial delay. I'm tipping at least 60 minutes.
@craigsta9010 I'm tipping 8 to 12 weeks but not totally giving up hope of a better result just yet.
@cricketaus Yes! If the weather holds, we might be able to start on or close to time.
@craigsta9010 I'll treat anything less than 8 weeks as a good result.
@craigsta9010 So I guess we'll have to resign ourselves to being without Greenwood for 3 months.
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Inbound delays on the Cranbourne/Pakenham line are down to 6 minutes after two separate incidents. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: The accident on Peninsula Link before Cranbourne Road has now been cleared. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
CODE RED ALERT: Buses running Broadmeadows&gt;Craigieburn until at least 11:00 due to a fatality at Craigieburn. 40min delays. #metrotrains
@magpie_fans Still, I'm not giving up hope just yet that he won't be out for an extended period.
@craigsta9010 If Eddie says Greenwood is out for 3 months, how much can we rely on his assessment?
@magpie_fans So I guess we might have to resign ourselves to 3 months without Greenwood and more time without Reid.
@magpie_fans I think Eddie is a bit of a pesimist, so I won't believe Greenwood is out for 3 months until the club confirm it.
@magpie_fans I understand that, but I'd much rather they be open and honest with their supporters.
@bushrangers Oh wait, that'll help us because we only need a draw to claim the title.
@bushrangers I don't want to be a pesimist, but rain &amp; showers are forecast throughout the day, so play is likely to be severely curtailed.
@magpie_fans It just annoys me that they're being so tight lipped. They really need to be more upfront about their injuries.
@craigsta9010 It just gets me that they're keeping things so quiet. They need to be more upfront about their injuries.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Inbound Glen Waverley line services are delayed up to 30 minutes due to a medical emergency at Heyington. #metrotrains
@magpie_fans Also rumours that Reid has done yet another hammy and is looking at multiple weeks. I don't think either are that bad.
@craigsta9010 I honestly don't think either of those are true.
@craigsta9010 I've heard nothing about Greenwood being out for 3 months. The club is hopeful only a couple of weeks at worst. Reid is ok.
CODE ORANGE ALERT: Left lane blocked inbound on Peninsula Link before Cranbourne Road due to a crash. Delays up to 25 minutes. #melbtraffic
@vline_seymour Sadly a person has been hit and killed by a train at Craigieburn. This will mean disruption for up to 3 more hours.
@melbtraffic This includes a fatality at Craigieburn train station which will see trains stopped Broadmeadows&gt;Craigieburn for up to 3hrs.

@chilternrailway I'd estimate that 80% of major repairs run either on or behind time &amp; only 20% run ahead of time. Makes it even better.
@arrivatw I can't believe it's been 6 months since the line between Harlech and Pwlheli reopened after a 10 month closure. That's flown by.
@chilternrailway But the best news is the line between Leamington Spa and Banbury having reopened just over a week ago. Well ahead of time.
@Davis_Harr Hey, I believe your sister turns 18 very soon if not already. How are you planning to celebrate?
@themightypies It sounds like he should be back before the end of April.
@TheMightyPies I'm feeling a little better about it now than last night.
@themightypies If it swelled up, what colour do you think the skin would have gone?
@themightypies Which ankle did he hurt?
@themightypies What sort of noise do you think the machines that scan those types of injuries make?
@themightypies Although it's also possible the club knows the results but won't publish them until tomorrow.
@themightypies He had scans today but I think the reason for the delay in the results is due to it being a Sunday.
@themightypies I say that because a broken ankle generally means months on the sidelines, not just a few weeks.
@themightypies Whereas if it's a broken bone, you usually find out straight away. I suppose no news is good news.
@themightypies before they can assess it properly. That's normal for bruising/ligament type injuries. Often takes a few days.
@themightypies 2/2 I suspect we won't know any more until tomorrow or Tuesday as they probably have to wait for the swelling to go down
@themightypies No news on Greenwood today, which makes me think it's not a break. If it was a break, we'd probably know by now. 1/2
@_ria84 True. If it was broken we'd know already. Hopefully not too bad.
@_ria84 @CollingwoodFC Probably have to wait for the swelling to go down before they can assess it properly.
@bushrangers Was the one sundry a no-ball, a wide, a bye or a leg-bye?
@iamtheoracle On the whole, I think we'd be happy to have bowled them out for 421. It could have been a lot worse.
@iamtheoracle I think you're 100% right. Ahmed saved us at least 200 runs.
@iamtheoracle Nothing wrong with getting out to a good ball, but we definitely wouldn't want to gift them wickets.
@iamtheoracle I thought at the time it was a bad toss to lose. They threatened to put us out of contension at various stages.
@collingwoodfc Hoping only 2-3 but fearing 6-8. I'd say we won't know until tomorrow or Tuesday.

@magpie_fans Well any hope of a return ahead of schedule just went out the window. I'm thinking VFL in July and AFL in August.
@magpie_fans Well there goes any hope of an early return. In fact, I'd say he'll be lucky to play at all this season.

@nationalrailenq Oh, and you also had disruption through #Bridgwater. #Banbury has been the only major disruption this winter.
@nationalrailenq This time last year, the lines through #Botley, #Dawlish, between Harlech &amp; #Pwlheli &amp; the #HastingsLine were all closed.
@nationalrailenq Wow. I just realised yesterday marked one year since the line through #Botley reopened after the landslip.
@collingwoodfc Do you mean sore hands from writing?
@greateranglia Are these disruptions showing on your service indicator as both yellow, both red or one red and one yellow?
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No issues to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains

Excuse me while I slit my wrists.
@collingwoodfc Yet again, poor defence and we get punished. That makes it pretty difficult. Can't afford to concede another one now.
@storm Maybe we can force an error?
@storm Yet another wrong decision. And it's at the wrong end of the ground. That's probably cost us any chance we had of winning.
@storm Blake Green gets another green light!
@themightypies How old is he?
@Dave_Middleton Ok thanks.
@dave_middleton I'm vision impaired so I can't see the pic. Who plays who at which venue?
@storm Blake Green got the green light!
@storm For once we get a bit of luck. Probably too late though.
@storm The referrees have cost us dearly tonight. At least three shocking decisions.
@storm At least that refereeing error didn't result in a try at the other end like the one in the first half.
@craigsta9010 I believe our quarter final will be at the Adelaide Oval at 2:30pm next Friday, correct?
@indiancricnews That refereeing error has potentially put the Storm out of the game. Also way too many silly penalties.
@storm That error by the video referree in robbing the Storm of a try has completely taken the wind out of their sails.
@farhan93_ The video referee made a wrong decision, but the Storm compounded it with poor defence.
@cricketworldcup @icc Looks like we might be waiting a while longer. Annoying drizzle is back and covers down. 30-60 minutes at least.
@cricketaus Rats! There goes any chance of an immediate restart. In fact, I think it might be an hour or more.
@wwos9 @darren_lehmann I suspect it'll be at least 20 to 30 minutes.
@bythemincricket I suspect this delay in Hobart might be a lengthy one. They might want to have dinner now to minimise the loss of overs.
@cricketaus I suspect this might be a fairly lengthy delay. It might be sensible to take the dinner break now to avoid a loss of overs.
@bythemincricket At least the review didn't take long. Some of the reviews in this tornament have taken far too long for my liking.
@iamtheoracle @jesse_hogan I think it might be. And this 9th wicket partnership has put on a few now.
@vflpies Even so, an 80 point margin wouldn't be a good look.
@vflpies This is getting a little embarrassing.
. @metrotrains So just to clarify, it's a mixture of trains and buses on the Cranbourne line, correct?
@vflpies @geelongvfl OH SHIT CODE RED CODE RED.
@vflpies Always nice when you don't have to wait long to get the goal you should have got before.
@wwos9 Now to stop the Cats from going coast-to-coast and scoring themselves.
@nationalrailenq And that means that for the first time since the #HarburyLandslip, your whole service indicator is green!
. @metrotrains Your site is still showing Burnley group trains bypassing the loop from last night. Please fix.
@chilternrailway Very pleased to see the line reopened 3 weeks early. Just in time for Mothers' Day!
@crosscountryuk @networkrail And both lines reopened on a Friday. The ultimate way to finish the working week.
@crosscountryuk @networkrail Just like the #Dawlish line last winter. Hard work led to an early reopening.
@crosscountryuk But great news with the line between Leamington Spa and Banbury having reopened 3 weeks earlier than was estimated.
@networkrail And how fitting that both lines should reopen on a Friday. The ultimate way to end the working week.
@networkrail The #Dawlish line last winter, and now this. Absolutely fantastic work.
@networkrail Great work by your engineers to reopen the line between Leamington Spa and Banbury 3 weeks ahead of schedule.
@nationalrailenq That was the only long term disruption (more than 7 days) this winter, whereas there were 8 of them last winter.
. @metrotrains With works at St Albans next weekend, why can't trains run between Watergardens and Sunbury?
@traffic_southe And almost 3 weeks early! The line was originally estimated to be closed until Thursday 2 April.
@nationalrailenq How appropriate that the line reopened on Friday the 13th. And particularly with it being 3 weeks earlier than expected.
@nationalrailenq Did the triangles tgo from red to yellow before turning to green ticks or did they go directly from red to green?
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Pakenham line after an earlier accident at Hallam. Services are back to normal. #metrotrains
@melbtraffic Great to see you back tweeting! What caused the updates to stop for 24 hours?
CODE YELLOW ALERT: Pakenham line reopened Dandenong&gt;Berwick after an earlier accident at Hallam. 10min delays during recovery. #metrotrains
@metrotrains @victoriapolice Of course that would happen on #FridayThe13th. At least it won't disrupt services during the #FridayPeak.
CODE RED ALERT: Major disruption on the Pakenham line. Please see the link below for full info. 
@nationalrailenq So happy to see the red triangles replaced by green ticks! Great work by @networkrail to reopen the line 3 weeks early.
@nationalrailenq Hooray! No last minute postponements! And the red triangles on your service indicator are gone!
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No delays or closures to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains

@afl What time on that day will the verdict be handed down?
2 people followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@danielbowen I've got a feeling it'll be blocked for a good couple of hours at least, maybe longer.
@jimmytraffic In that case, it'll most likely be closed until much later tonight.
@VictoriaPolice Thanks guys
@VictoriaPolice Why are police and emergency vehicle lights two colours?
Works on the Glen Waverley and Sandringham lines this weekend. More here: 
@metrotrains I'd say the chances of trains resuming tonight are fairly slim, but I think it's safe to assume tomorrow morning will be ok.
@nationalrailenq That disruption cleared 60 minutes earlier than you were expecting.
So full I wanna barf.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No delays or disruptions to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@victoriapolice Why did you only close the road to westbound traffic? A fatal usually means the road closed both directions.
@themightypies @gullanheraldsun @magpie_fans @superfooty Exactly. Better draw +healthier list =back in the 8.
@magpie_fans @gullanheraldsun @superfooty @themightypies Last year was a train wreck, but we'll be back in the 8 this year.
CODE GREEN ALERT: There was a brief disruption due to an unruly passenger at Newport, but this has now cleared. #metrotrains
CODE PINK ALERT: The Werribee/Williamstown line is screwed up because someone's being a jerk. Excuse for being late to work. #metrotrains
@bythemincricket It always had that feel about it. Ireland's score was well below par and then they compounded it with poor bowling.
@bythemincricket Correction: It's Kohli and Rahane at the crease. Dahwan is out.
@melbtraffic Okay. Thanks for clearing that up.
@MelbTraffic Your updates have been a bit sporadic today and you missed the entire morning peak. What seems to be the problem?
@VicRoads ok thanks
@vicroads Is this incident still current or did an error occur when you tried to remove/update it?
@AFL Thanks guys
one person followed me and 3 people unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@storm Justice. Two wrong decisions by the referees late in the game. Luckily they didn't cost the Storm the game.
@storm That's another wrong decision. That better not result in a try up the other end.
@storm I'm sorry, that's a wrong decision. That better not cost the Storm the game.
@storm Waste of time going upstairs, but at least the video ref made a quick decision. Sometimes they take forever.
CODE  GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No problems to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@chrisbates3 @chilternrailway @crosscountryuk Good. I'm glad no undue risks were taken to get the early reopening for Mothers' Day revenue.
@chrisbates3 @chilternrailway @crosscountryuk I just hope corners haven't been cut and safety compromised for the sake of Mothers' Day.
@chrisbates3 @chilternrailway @crosscountryuk So did they demand an early reopening because they felt early April was unacceptably long?
@mackay92_sean Oh. I didn't realise they finished earlier than other lines. Sorry.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The Stony Point line is open. There are no incidents. Services are running well. #metrotrains
CODE PINK ALERT: Stony Point line closed due to Easter egg slip. Will be closed until Monday 6 April or until eggs are eaten. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: The Pakenham line has reopened between Berwick and Pakenham after a train hit a car at Officer. No delays. #metrotrains
CODE RED ALERT: Pakenham line disruption remains. Please see the link below for full info. 
@MelbTraffic Accident recovery in Officer taking longer than expected. Pakenham line now likely to be out until at least 4pm, maybe later.
CODE RED ALERT: Pakenham line disruption continues. Please see the link below for full info. 
@metrotrains I'm now starting to think trains won't be back running until after 4pm.
@chrisbarrett_ @theagesport I think Marsh may have picked up a slight side strain.
@pauldowsley7 @metrotrains @7newsmelbourne I'd expect the Pakenham line will be out until 3pm at the earliest, possibly later.
Sydney weather today: partly cloudy. Chance of any rain: 15%. Disruption threat level: Code Green. #cricket #AusVSL #CWC15
@MelbTraffic Nasty accident involving a train and car in officer on Brunt Rd at Rix Rd. Pakenham line closed till at least 3pm as a result.
CODE RED ALERT: Major disruption on the Pakenham line. Please see the link below for full info. 
@nationalrailenq That was a joke. But I like pink. I associate pink with humour.
@nationalrailenq Or will you be sticking with green, yellow and red?
@nationalrailenq Hey, maybe as an April Fools Day joke you should use pink diamonds! That'd be funny!
@nationalrailenq So it's green ticks, yellow and red triangles with black writing.
@nationalrailenq Are the words "Major delays on some routes" in red writing or is it just the triangle that's red?
@nationalrailenq And as a result, the red triangles next to Chiltern Railway and Cross Country don't make me so angry anymore.
@chilternrailway Given that stat, to see this lot of repairs running 3 weeks ahead of schedule is something of a miracle.
@chilternrailway In fact, I'd estimate that 80% of these types of repairs run either on or behind schedule &amp; only 20% run ahead of schedule.
@chilternrailway It's not too often that you see repairs of this type run 3 weeks ahead of schedule, in fact, a lot of them suffer setbacks.
@nationalrailenq So to see this lot of repairs running 3 weeks ahead of schedule is very pleasing.
@nationalrailenq In fact, I'd estimate that 80% of these types of repairs run either on or behind schedule &amp; only 20% run ahead of schedule.
@nationalrailenq Not often you see  major landslip repairs run 3 weeks ahead of schedule. In fact, most of them suffer delays.
@nationalrailenq I'm very pleased the #BanburyLine will be reopening in 6 days instead of 4 weeks.
@buzzpuppy @metrotrains Okay. Perhaps I was a little harsh. I'm just glad it wasn't a person hit by train incident.
@chilternrailway Also, I think Friday is a good day for the line to reopen because it ends the working week on a high note.
@chilternrailway Whoops! I meant landslide. #typo
@chilternrailway But I'm very pleased that lindslide work completion time has been reduced from 4 weeks to 6 days from now.
@mackay92_sean The Metro healthboard currentl y has all colours displayed except black. Which one do you think is the brightest?
@mackay92_sean Oh okay. So if that incident had happened during the day, the Cranbourne line would have been suspended as well.
@se_railway I'm glad you noticed the typo in your last tweet.
@mackay92_sean @metrotrains How long has the Cranbourne line been a shuttle between Dandenong and Cranbourne?
@metrotrains Why wasn't the Cranbourne line suspended as well?
@metrotrains It's taking an eternity to remove the person from the tracks at Noble Park.
@cricketaus They really should be back out now. No reason for the extra 10 minutes. Delays are always that little bit longer than necessary.
@cricketaus They should resume now. No need for the extra 10 minutes.
@cricket_world I think they should restart immediately. No need for the extra 10 minute delay. Happens way too often with delays.
@cricket_world No reason to wait an extra 10 minutes. This happens way too often. A delay is always that little bit longer than necessary.
@cricketaus Looks like the delay in Auckland might be a fairly lengthy one. I'd say 60 minutes minimum.
@bythemincricket I suspect this will be a minimum 60 minute delay, maybe longer. Some overs will be lost for certain.

@networkrail Pink would look funny, but orange is much more visible and safer. I was joking.
@networkrail Hey, maybe your engineers should ware pink on April Fools Day as a joke! Or will you be sticking with orange?
@bushrangers I thought Head was the 4th wicket to fall.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail I'm very pleased that the reopening has been brought forward to be only 7 days away rather than 4 weeks.
@nationalrailenq If @networkrail were only working on the #HarburyLandslip between 08:00 and 18:00 Monday-Friday, it would take months.
@nationalrailenq But whenever my birthday falls on a weekday, it occurs 30 minutes after the account becomes staffed as I was born at 08:30.
@nationalrailenq So it won't be staffed on my 28th birthday on 2 May as it falls on a Saturday.
@nationalrailenq Hi. For future reference, what hours is @networkrail's account staffed?
@bradqmelb @jimmytraffic @tazelder Not helped by a collision blocking the left lane outbound at Belgrave/Hallam Road.
@citylinkmelb I meant the works between Swanston and Flinders Streets.
CODE GREEN ALERT: The Lilydale line had been closed due to a track fault at Mooroolbark, but has now reopened. No delays. #metrotrains
@translinkseq That was quick.
@metrotrains That fault took almost 24 hours to fix. Not good.
@metrotrains Hi. How much extra time will the replacement buses between Mooroolbark and Lilydale add to journey times?
@CityLinkMelb Hi. Are you expecting the emergency works on Batman Ave to finish in time for the PM peak? I certainly hope so.
@metrotrains There doesn't seem to be any progress on the Mooroolbark track fault. It's becoming a concern.
@nationalrailenq I always thought a closure until Easter sounded a little pesimistic.
@nationalrailenq I'm very pleased the disruption won't last anywhere near as long as previously estimated.
@metrotrains How much extra time will this add to journey times?
@nationalrailenq So once the #Banbury disruption is moved to your cleared disruptions page, it should be there until Saturday 14 March.
@metrotrains I'm starting to think trains won't run between Ringwood and Lilydale for the rest of the night.
@nationalrailenq After a disruption has cleared, how long will it remain on your cleared disruptions page?
My new phone credit is taking way too long to reach my account. #bullshit
@nationalrailenq @networkrail By my count, there were 8 long term disruptions (more than 7 days) last winter, and only 1 this winter.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail It's also pleasing to see the number of long term disruptions this winter is way down on last winter.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail So to have a reopening date confirmed and to see it 3 weeks ahead of schedule is an outstanding result.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail I wasn't expecting a reopening date announcement until the last week of March let alone an early reopening.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail How appropriate #Banbury reopens on Friday the 13th. Not so unlucky for many commuters.
@networkrail Given that stat, having 3 weeks shaved off the #HarburyLandslip works is an outstanding result.
@networkrail In fact, I'd estimate that 80% of major repairs finish either on or behind schedule and only 20% finish ahead of schedule.
@networkrail Very pleased to hear #HarburyLandslip works are 3 weeks ahead of schedule. That doesn't happen very often with major repairs.
@melbtraffic Glad it's not blocking any running lanes, otherwise delays would be horrendous.
@nationalrailenq Very pleased to hear the #Banbury line will be reopening three weeks ahead of schedule.
Works on the Frankston line this long weekend. Details here: 
@nationalrailenq wow! Three weeks ahead of schedule! Great work by @networkrail.
@networkrail @nationalrailenq How would it look if the actual landslip was the colour of your engineers' uniforms?
@nationalrailenq @networkrail 2/2 But knowing it'll be well before my 28th birthday at 08:30 on Saturday 2 May makes me feel a lot better.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail My gut feel is you won't have a date until the last week of March. I'll check back then unless it changes. 1/2
@nationalrailenq How can they see what they're doing at night?
@nationalrailenq Are works being done 24 hours a day or only during daylight hours?
@nationalrailenq I wasn't asking for an exact date, but as I said, a Thursday feels like a good day as it's a good lead into the weekend.
@nationalrailenq The #Dawlish line reopened on a Friday. Thursday or Friday always feels like a good day for a line to reopen after closure.
@nationalrailenq That's a Thursday. Thursday feels like a good day for any major disruption to end because it's close to the weekend.
@nationalrailenq Is @networkrail still optimistic of a pre-Easter reopening?
Perth weather today: sunny. Chance of any rain: 0%. Disruption threat level: Code Green. #cricket #AusVAFG #CWC15
CODE GREEN ALERT: Just a reminder that normal services have resumed on the Pakenham line following a power outage this morning. #metrotrains
@bradqmelb @7newsmelbourne @9newsmelb Two left lanes are currently closed and there is a possibility that more lanes could close.
@melbtraffic What is the reason that you put #INCIDENT, #CONGESTION, #ALERT, UPDATE and CLEARED all in capital letters?
@venturabus Although the train line has just come back on, so boom gates should lift soon, if they haven't already, and traffic should ease.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Full train services resumed on the Pakenham line following disruption caused by a power outage. No delays. #metrotrains
@melbtraffic And more good news, power has just come back on the Pakenham train line, so all boom gates should lift soon, if not already.
@metrotrains That took a heck of a long time.
@paullatter I remember that horrible accident in Mona Vale which resulted in a 48 hour closure. The road escapes me.
@paullatter I hope it's not fatal, otherwise the highway may be blocked for a large part of the day.
@melbtraffic I heard some reports that it may be cable theft, which usually takes a minimum of 4 hours to fix, and sometimes longer.
@vline_geelong I heard some reports that it may be cable theft, which usually means disruption for at least 4 hours, sometimes longer.
CODE PINK ALERT: Pakenham line screwup will last hours as crews are caught in traffic. Tell the boss you'll be late for work. #metrotrains
CODE GREEN ALERT: The Stony Point line had been closed since Monday afternoon due to emergency works, but has now reopened. #metrotrains
. @metrotrains The Pakenham line may be a mess, but it looks like the Stony Point line has finally reopened, correct?
@melbtraffic So I guess Pound Road is getting pounded!
. @metrotrains Hearing reports it could be cable theft on the Pakenham line so it might be at least a few more hours. Is this correct?
2/2 Services that are running may be delayed up to 15 minutes. #metrotrains

Some of these third umpire decisions are taking too long. #cricket #CWC15
Oh barf. Shut up. 
@MelbTraffic Looks like your account might be playing up again. Second time that's happened today, and both at the worst possible times.
@vicroads Had it been closed in both directions, it would have appeared as a red circle with a white line through it.
@vicroads For example, the Clarendon St incident appeared as a yellow triangle w/  a black exclamation mark as only northbound was closed.
@vicroads I've observed that if a road is only closed in one direction, the yellow triangle with the black exclamation mark appears.
@vicroads I was referring to the ones on your site. There are only 8 of them at the moment, but we can't predict when a road will close.
@nationalrailenq I dreamt last night that the line was just about to reopen and then had to be delayed at the last minute by 6 weeks.
@nationalrailenq I'm just glad there haven't been any setbacks.
@nationalrailenq At least works haven't stalled since the weekend.
@MelbTraffic Clarendon Street has just reopened northbound at Normanby Road after an earlier accident. Traffic is okay.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Clarendon Street has reopened northbound at Normanby Road after an earlier accident. There are no delays. #melbtraffic
@metrotrains If repair crews tell you that works will extend into tomorrow or beyond, please put this on your site.
@metrotrains So it'll be tomorrow at the earliest, possibly later.
@metrotrains Are you expecting that will happen this afternoon?
. @metrotrains Hi. Your site still has the Stony Point line listed as closed. Is this still the case? If not, please update your site.
@melbtraffic Also, the latest report on the Clarendon Street incident is that it is expected to reopen within the next 15 minutes.
@melbtraffic I was going to the gym with my mum and we came across it. They must have finished.
CODE GREEN ALERT: South Morang line reopened Epping&gt;South Morang after an earlier track fault at South Morang. No delays. #metrotrains
. @metrotrains Hi. When are you hoping to have the Stony Point line fixed? It's now been 24 hours.
@MelbTraffic Left lane closed in both directions on Balwyn Rd between Mont Albert Rd &amp; Whitehorse Rd for tree lopping works. 3-4min delays.
CODE RED ALERT: South Morang line closed Epping&gt;South Morang due to track fault at South Morang. Buses sent. 30min delays. #metrotrains
@mfelgate7 @7newsmelbourne Given it's a stolen car, I suspect the area will be out of bounds for quite a few hours, maybe into the PM peak.
CODE RED ALERT: Clarendon St closed northbound at Normanby Rd due to an accident. Delays up to 30 minutes through diversions. #melbtraffic
The Twitter app on my phone had a temporary malfunction so I turned it off and then back on again and now it's working. #ProblemSolving
@vicroads That would look kind of cool. But I suspect you'll be sticking with the traditional red and white.

@MelbTraffic Glad it's all fixed now.
@nationalrailenq The #Banbury line might reopen before #Strood at this rate. #joke
@networkrail Are #HarburyLandslip works happening 24 hours a day or only during daylight hours?
@melbtraffic Your first day of weekday reports has been outstanding. The best 24/7 traffic reporting account in Melbourne! Keep it up!

CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on Punt Road at Hodel Street after earlier delays due to heavy traffic. #melbtraffic
. @metrotrains Are you still hoping to fix the Stony Point line before service finishes tonight or have you ruled that out?
@nationalrailenq I dreamt last night the line between Leamington Spa &amp; Banbury was just about to reopen &amp; got delayed at the last minute.
@nationalrailenq Te disruption cleared 60 minutes earlier than you were expecting. Always nice when a disruption clears ahead of time.
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now in Croydon on Lincoln Road at Dorcet Road after an earlier accident. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic

CODE YELLOW ALERT: Accident in Oakleigh on Warrigal Road at North Road. Delays up to 10 minutes in all directions. #melbtraffic
@translinkseq And that means the icon on your site for this disruption has changed from a red circle to a green tick.
@melbtraffic I'm vision impaired. What colour are ramp signals?
@melbtraffic I'm not asking for an exact delay for this incident, but I'd say a "heavy delay" would be 15 minutes and above.
@melbtraffic All previously tweeted suggestions would make trip planning even easier.
@melbtraffic No delays/incident cleared: green. 0-5min: blue. 5-15min: yellow. 15-30min: code orange. &gt;30min or road closed: red.
@melbtraffic And finally, I wish to suggest that delays be colour coded as follows in next tweet:
@melbtraffic This extra info would make trip planning even easier. Thank you.
@melbtraffic #INCIDENT Crash in Kooyong, outbound on Monash Fwy at Toorak Rd. LHL closed. Delays up to 25 minutes.
@melbtraffic And where possible, please tweet which lane or lanes (if any) are closed and the length of a delay. Example in next tweet:
@MelbTraffic Hi. I wish to suggest that you also tweet breakdowns, roadworks and traffic lights blacked out or flashing orange.
@AFL Hi. Would you be able to send me a link to the new MRP table of penalties? Thank you.
CODE GREEN ALERT: Our roads and our rail network are currently all clear. No incidents to report. #melbtraffic #metrotrains
@MelbTraffic That equates to a delay of up to 40 minutes.

@networkrail Which line currently holds the record for the longest unplanned closure? Harlech to Pwlheli would have to be right up there.
@nationalrailenq I always remember that it will be fixed well before my 28th birthday at 08:30 on Saturday 2 May &amp; it makes me feel better.
@nationalrailenq Whenever I read the words "Buses replace trains between Leamington Spa and Banbury until further notice" and I get angry,
@networkrail Whatever happens, knowing it'll be fixed before my 28th birthday at 08:30 on Saturday 2 May makes me feel a whole lot better.
@networkrail Maybe you could turn the landslip into easter eggs! Then you'd have an #EasterEggSlip! Yum!
@networkrail I'm still amazed that you managed to reopen the #Dawlish line within 8 weeks of those storms. It could have been much longer.
@networkrail I can imagine it would have been very disheartening to see all the work that you'd done on that line undone by bad weather.
@networkrail We don't want to see a reopening date announced then have to be delayed at the last minute like the #HastingsLine last winter.
@networkrail It sounds like Thursday 2 April is a worst case scenario.
@networkrail That's good. I take it that completion earlier than Thursday 2 April hasn't yet been ruled out.
@nationalrailenq And it looks likely that they'll have to put up with this for the rest of the term. I hope they're coping well.
@nationalrailenq 2/2 some schoolchildren would have to get up very early and wouldn't get home until well after dark.
@nationalrailenq With replacement buses between Leamington Spa and Banbury making journey times up to 90 minutes longer, I'd imagine 1/2
@nationalrailenq But there'll be no school on my 28th birthday as it falls on a Saturday. It comes up at 08:30 on Saturday 2 May.
@nationalrailenq In that case, I suspect most schools would then resume at 09:00 on Monday 20 April.
@nationalrailenq Also, what are school hours in the UK? In Melbourne, school hours are generally 09:00 until 15:30.
@nationalrailenq So I presume the last day of term for most schools will be Thursday 2 April.
@networkrail Hi. How's the weather treating you as you work on the #HarburyLandslip?
@nationalrailenq How long do the children have off school over Easter?
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now in the Domain Tunnel after an earlier accident. Traffic is back to normal. #melbtraffic
CODE GREEN ALERT: All clear now on the Tullamarine Freeway after an earlier accident at the Ring Road. Traffic back to normal. #melbtraffic
CODE RED ALERT: All lanes now open in the Domain Tunnel after an earlier accident but still delays up to 60 minutes. #melbtraffic
@nationalrailenq @networkrail So whenever the indefinite status and the red triangles start to make me angry, I'll remember that.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Whatever happens, knowing it'll be fixed before my birthday at 08:30 on Saturday 2 May makes me feel better.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Ah, I know! How about you turn the rocks into Easter eggs! Than you'd have an #EastereggSlip! Yum!
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Nothing more disheartening than when repairs are almost complete and then it's all undone by bad weather.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail We certainly wouldn't want the reopening to be delayed at the last minute like the #HastingsLine last winter.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Is bad weather stalling progress or has the weather been okay?
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Surely there must be a way to speed it up. Because with the indefinite status, I'm starting to get impatient.
CODE RED ALERT: Middle lane still closed in Domain Tunnel for crash. Tow taking longer than expected. 80min delays. Avoid. #melbtraffic
@nationalrailenq @networkrail When do you think you might have a date?
@nationalrailenq @networkrail Also, I hope a reopening date is announced at least 7 days before reopening. 2 or 3 days is too tight.
@nationalrailenq @networkrail So a March reopening hasn't yet been officially ruled out.
@nationalrailenq Is there still some hope that it could be fixed sometime during March rather than April or has that been ruled out?
@citylinkmelb @vicroads The tow truck seems to be taking a heck of a long time to arrive. What's hampering its progress?

@Craigsta9010 I certainly didn't expect it to blow out like that.
Surely that scoreboard is wrong. #HawksVPies #NABChallenge

@nationalrailenq So if that's anything to go by, if #Banbury reopens on Thursday 2 April, confirmation won't be until Wednesday 1 April.
@nationalrailenq I say this because confirmation of the reopening date for the #HastingsLine didn't come until the day before it reopened.
@nationalrailenq If Thursday 2 April does end up being the date, I suspect it won't be announced until a day or two before.
@nationalrailenq The uncertainty is dragging on way too long and I'm starting to get impatient.
@nationalrailenq Of course, you can revise it if required. Had to say that in separate tweets due to the character limit. Sorry about that.
@nationalrailenq Because that's the date the line looks likely to be closed until and the wording should reflect this.
@nationalrailenq "Buses replace trains between Leamington Spa and Banbury expected until Thursday 2 April".
@nationalrailenq Hi. I tweet to suggest that the wording on your live disruptions page re the #Banbury disruption page should be as follows:
5 people followed me // automatically checked by 
@DebinMelbourne no. Rude.
@greateranglia Good to see @networkrail have given the green light. No line closure required.
@craigsta9010 @stevo7afl I believe it's Keeffe, but it's only minor and won't cost him any home and away games, which is good news.
