@Chase9859 2 incisions that needed stitches
@Chase9859 I went today, it's just my incision that still hurts like a bitch
@Chase9859 yeah but it didn't make a difference, I just don't have an appetite anymore
@Chase9859 I just have to take more than prescribed along with ibuprofen and it makes me nauseous so I have to take other stuff for that
@Chase9859 no that's a blood thinner
@Chase9859 my body rejects drugs
Never get surgery, just don't do it
You'd think these daily shots would get easier but nope
And like you know the people sort of but its still amazing how much drama they create in their own little Twitter universe
When you can't do anything all day you eventually find these strange parts of Twitter where there is this crazy high school drama
I think my dad purposely comes downstairs and makes a bunch of noise to wake me and mom up cuz he thinks we're lazy and sleep all day
My mom had to shower me today and I feel so bad, but I'm so glad she did it and everything else she's had to do this week
Am I the only one that doesn't think the notebook is that romantic? She screams so damn much
I have eaten more pills this week than food
I had yet another rough day, so if anybody wants to come hold my hand that'd be great
The X-ray doctor in the ER knows me by name now
I'm getting real sick of these pills, too many hallucinations
Dear Allen McCoy, I'm not being "over dramatic" I'm STILL INJURED I promise I'm not making it up
Can't tell if I'm awake or not
Going on social media with blurred vision is such a bad idea
@em_veronica so much better, much better drugs

Catrina just finished reading Goblet of Fire and called Cho, Chew and the tri-wizard tournament the twizard tournament <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Dad, I'm not "being bitchy" I'm in pain, I never rose my voice or said anything mean, weren't you the one who said I needed to relax to heal
If you are ever in need of super soft, comfy underwear (ie after surgery) I highly suggest VS PINK shorties, seriously, life savers
These pills make my dreams and reality melt together so half the time im not sure what is happening
Yaaaaaaas best frand 
@Rachel_Rank thank you! I'm much better now that I've got the right pain killers
Today is shower day and I'm not excited
@Rachel_Rank don't worry I'm not anymore, I was there yesterday cuz my painkillers weren't working after surgery
@Rachel_Rank I totes would <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Also it would be awesome if I could go pee myself just sayin
In case anyone was curious, the rooms in the ER with tvs in them have a lot of good movies
My eyes are vibrating
Just opened instagram in my sleep and accidentally liked some pictures not sure who's but I do apologize
This is beautiful  
So these pills really knock me out so if I accidentally snap or do something on Twitter it's cuz I fell asleep with my phone on in my hand
This bun has lasted through surgery, the ER, and two nights on the couch
I want to submerge my leg into liquid nitrogen
My diet consists of oxycodone and ibuprofen

Dad: are you staying hydrated?
Me: I had 2 liters of fluid via IV this morning, 3 juice boxes, 2 glasses of water and 1 lemonade, I'm good
S/O to my mom for staying up with me a taking me to the ER, and S/O to @JamieSchiffer07 for bringing me food and love

Land Sheila and sea Sheila  
S/O to the ER doctors and nurses I had today, and also shout out to IVs I actually kinda love them now

In the past 24 hours I've had 4 liters of fluid through iv, had 4 different needles in me and 5 people see me naked
FU acl reconstruction <POUTING FACE>
The nurse today said I had great veins, so to the guy who gave me an iv when I was 13 and couldn't get a vein, you just sucked at your job
I did it, if anybody wants to visit I'll be on the couch in the living room
Terrified
@Chase9859 hey I ain't complaining
