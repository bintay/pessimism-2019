why am i such an emotional wreck
officially in love with alex karev
i regret nothing #bye
I'm tired of hearing shit about how i "offended the trans community" I AM A FUCKING PART OF THAT COMMUNITY
I never want to see this school or most of the people in it ever again. And I am ashamed to say that I ever went here.
i hate this school. I have wasted two years of my life with people who couldn't care less about others. I'm done.
currently very disappointed in a portion of my student body.
I get that some of you are worried about the "non binary community." Let me remind you that I am part of that community.
We are working hard to include everyone and not be inconsiderate. I am appalled at how our club has been treated. It's time to be grown ups.
Join the club instead of complaining to my members or officers or vandalizing our APPROVED posters. If anyone is offended here, it's GSA.
Also, this is all a learning experience. And for future reference, if you want a voice or part in something, join the club.
To everyone who is freaking out about something dealing with Pride Week- I need you to chill out. We are trying our best.
@KarleighGwyn &lt;3
so if you haven't heard this is my last year at LSMSA and if you have to ask me why you need to rethink your life
you: omg I can't wait for spring fling and graduation and blahblahblahblahblah!!!!
me: "I'm getting tf out next week lmao bye"
@sarahap16 lmao I do that shit in class
