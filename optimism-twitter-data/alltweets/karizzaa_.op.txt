Dude. I don't understand why people still brake when there's a green light.
@theralphenator omg yea especially in monterey park lmao I still haven't gotten used to the terrible drivers
@theralphenator there's always gonna be people like that but you gotta have hope that you'll meet people worthwhile. That's how I see it
@theralphenator I think so, but I'm trying to be more optimistic and hopeful. I'm tired of feeding off of negative energy
<SKULL><SKULL><SKULL> 
@theralphenator Yupp, which is why it's sometimes better to be pessimistic, expecting the worst and knowing what how to handle it
@theralphenator but by ignoring those issues you fail to see reality and choose to live in denial and in fantasy where nothing goes wrong
@theralphenator I kinda see it as a personal thing. Like it's easy to block out all of the issues and obstacles in your life
@theralphenator yea a bit pessimistic but it makes sense!
@theralphenator Hmm that's an interesting interpretation
@theralphenator right? How do you perceive it?
@theralphenator LOVE omg one of my favorite quotes ever
