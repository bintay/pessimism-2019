@jordynm097 that's what I thought. @QIzaec take care of your girlfriend, she forgot to take her medicine.
@jordynm097 very*
@jordynm097 therefore that comment was ever relevant. So maybe you should look up the definition of "irrelevant"
@jordynm097 Apparently you don't cause you taking the time out of your life to screen shot what I say means you are fascinated with my life
@jordynm097 do you what irreverent means? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@jordynm097 nope. But I'm glad to see you take interest in my life.
Say what you want about me I don't care. I was sticking up for my school and athletes just like the rest of you guys were
@jordynm097 oh yeah cause I'm such an angry person...
Who won ferris g prep game?
@OG_MB33 @marisa_alannaa @ChubbinD_YaDigg argue is you guys didn't start it. It's that simple.
@OG_MB33 @marisa_alannaa @ChubbinD_YaDigg or not? You guys start it every single time. U guys get all butt hurt when we argue but we wouldnt
@OG_MB33 @marisa_alannaa @ChubbinD_YaDigg cause you guys started it. This tweet is why I made mine

I'm done arguing with your idiots. So stop tagging me in shit
@ShyCarr_24 we will win basketball games. Thanks tho
@ChristinaHill_8 shadle and take the easy way out
@ChristinaHill_8 that's cause they are scared of a challenge. They didn't want to go to nc and change things, they would rather go to
@TheBigNipper at least I played? What did you do? What did you do? Sit in the stands and be a cheer leader? Nice.
@cardoug14 they started it so don't cry when I talk back. U guys say we suck everyday so you get over your self
@cardoug14 then why did u follow me if I'm an asshole? I'm a ass hole for defending my school and our athletes? K.
@cardoug14 is someone's feelings hurt? You guys start it every time. So don't cry when we talk back

@TheBigNipper of space on earth
@TheBigNipper you don't even play a sport? So how can your lazy ass even try to talk shit? You have done nothing in your life. Your s waste
@TheBigNipper and exactly are you?
@Buhrnardy about that Cause you guys don't know how to put that many words together
@Buhrnardy it's called character count. You have to shorten things up so you can tweet it. But that's okay cause u shadle kids wouldn't know
@Buhrnardy that's was you shadle kids get to thinking. Listen. You guys are stupid, so stop trying to comprehend things.
@Buhrnardy weird? Don't remember ever saying I was mad?
@TheBigNipper it's called character count fuck tard. I don't wanna hear anything about test scores, u guys fail miserably
Now that football is over, get ready to get your asses kicked shadle. Your guys suck your horrible.Your predicted to get last. Good luck.not
@_Scott_Or_Not how? You basically just said we suck but we have spirit. That's a bad thing?
@_Scott_Or_Not wait till wrestling season. You fags won't be able to say shit cause you guys suck

@Buhrnardy if u see anyone talking crap tell me and I will talk with them. This is stupid and shouldn't happen every day. It gets old
@Buhrnardy yes it did. All I'm saying is we won't talk shit about u guys and u don't talk shit about us. Then we have no problems.
@Buhrnardy how aren't we when u started it? You instigated it therefore making us the victims?
@Buhrnardy nc wants to be represented.
@Buhrnardy well maybe. I don't follow every single person at nc. So I wouldn't know. But I apologize on their behave cause that's not how
@QIzaec of course!
@Buhrnardy the only time we talk crap to you guys is when u start it? Never have we came out and started it. It's always you guys
@Buhrnardy what u mean? That didn't make sense
@hannah_tomsha @Buhrnardy that's a true statement. But it's over with so let's just move on
@Buhrnardy @hannah_tomsha what u mean? I have never talked crap about u guys unless u guys started it?
@hannah_tomsha @Buhrnardy that doesn't make sense cause if u guys didn't say anything then I wouldn't have said anything?
@hannah_tomsha @Buhrnardy that's why you guys are still the "bad guys"
@hannah_tomsha @Buhrnardy not fighting at all so don't even start. I'm just saying that u guys saying we suck is what started the argument
@CourtneyyAnnnee wow! That's a huge thing for your dad!
@Buhrnardy @shane_5pethers @therealzaqmuns I'm done. Just stop. It's over
@CourtneyyAnnnee don't worry I got you
@Buhrnardy @shane_5pethers @therealzaqmuns you started it?!?!? But o forgot, football determines your whole life. Sorry. Forgot

@kmoney6093 true. But also on the other hand I love my friends and I'm not going to let some piece of shit low life talk crap about them

Sorry guys. I'm just being a leader and sticking up for my school. They started it so I had to finish it. But I'm done now. Thanks.
@therealzaqmuns have a good night
@therealzaqmuns so I'm just going to leave you with this. 
@therealzaqmuns I'm done talking to you idiots. U don't under stand English or look at the bigger picture. There's other sports besides Fb
@therealzaqmuns who said u were good? Cause I'm pretty sure ur the only one that says that lol
@therealzaqmuns we are better academically. So please tell me how u guys can talks shit?
@therealzaqmuns cause as I see it, we beat u in more sports then u beat us, and we have multiple state titles in multiple sports
@therealzaqmuns I mean it's high only high school but if you wanna talk shit about my school then I can talk shit right back
@therealzaqmuns yes please keep going cause the only thing that u said that actually matters is your going to college. Congrats.
Come talk to me when you have one of these..... Don't worry I'll wait. 
@therealzaqmuns and what have u ever accomplished in your life? U beat people at football. Congrats. What else do u win at? Nothing.
Once you graduate and move on to bigger and better things (hopefully) nothing you did in high school matters. Think about before u talk
Do u guys realized high school is only 4 years of your life? Why constantly talk mad crap when none of it will matter once u graduate?
@KhalilWinfrey no problem bro
@KhalilWinfrey yeah bro, keep working hard and you will go some where. Looking forward to playing you guys
@baydickinson @Buhrnardy oh and not to mention we beat u guys academically too so eat our asses
