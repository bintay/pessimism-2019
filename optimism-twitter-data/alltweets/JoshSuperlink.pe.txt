@photonblaze wha, really? o_o
@TaylorsShelf agreed, I can't wait for it ^^
@TaylorsShelf He's been putting up with Yooka-Layle haters and he seems a bit down about it :c I hope he feels better tomorrow.
@neuropsychic he's been putting up w Yooka Laylee haters and he seems kinda down about it..
Grant Kirkhope has had a bad day ): that saddens me
@kujikawaii @snowhaired yeah the objective is extremely clear and communication isn't really needed
@snowhaired yea exactly, it's a conscious design choice.
@kujikawaii beautiful
@kujikawaii so dedede doesn't even get a trophy??

WHY...
@RaqibMarvelous depends on your mood and mindset at the time, I'm a sore loser myself so I understand I think.
Chillin is ice cold.
LRT WOW
@kujikawaii Dedede is too perfect to be made out of clay

but honestly that is really weird, where has my king gone
Started playing Kirby Rainbow Paintbrush earlier today, so much fun in coop! Way more fun than I expected, definitely don't regret it.
@princeofrot so many hours spent looking for super rare drops with friends, memories T_T
@princeofrot @YouTube I was so happy that this song was in Curtain Call
@princeofrot @YouTube YESSS ;-;
@wpstart @Pokemon TvT god if only
@Stealth___ I wonder, I think a lot of ppl will refuse to buy the game if they know it has no voice chat ):
.@Pokemon My mom would tell me to go to the Battle Frontier but I can't cause it's not in ORAS. ):
RARE Pepe
@Wil348 The best way to get attention for something is to announce it alongside new tech announcements, generates more hype that way.
@Wil348 I'm hoping those things are improved for next gen too. They won't happen before then though.
@Wil348 If Nintendo are less pro-active in risks the last couple years it's because they're cutting their lesses and preparing for NX risks.
@Wil348 Yeah taking risks is how the Wii and DS happened, but when risks (gamepad) fuck up, relying on their safety nets helps them live.
@Wil348 focusing on multiple audiences is much more dangerous than focusing on one.
@Wil348 It hurts them in ways but it also gives them a viable place on the market that no one else is actively occupying.
@Wil348 Yeah I hope the DeNA partnership really helps them improve that. NX's online infrastructure needs to be hugely improved.
@Wil348 Sony and MS' images are markedly different. They have ALWAYS had an older image and if parents let their kids go online it's on them
@Wil348 yep I agree totally, but unless the Wii U's infrastructure is changed, nothing can be done about Splatoon.
@Wil348 Their image would take a serious hit and that's a hole they've dug themselves into and now have to sidestep around.
@Wil348 If a parent caught their child being sworn at on Splatoon, on their "family" Nintendo console, Nintendo would be in the papers.
@Wil348 remember the Pictochat controversy a while back? Stuff like that makes Nintendo's stock PLUMMET.
@Wil348 it's part of it but it can't really be helped because image is extremely important to a brand
@wevles OH BOY
@wevles Ed Balls
@TommyNapolitano I understand why people want it but coordination isn't a problem in Splatoon.
@TommyNapolitano I dunno Splatoon is fine without it, it's usually pretty clear what to do in any given match.
@TommyNapolitano yeah exactly, you really can't blame them for wanting to protect their younger players
@TommyNapolitano ppl want them to change but they don't take everything important into account
@Wil348 it could solve pretty much all their online worries
@Wil348 yeah Nintendo really needs a more reliable parental control system
@Tracker_TD niiice
@Tracker_TD is that Colours in HD?
My view on voice chat in Splatoon: it should at least be an option for friend matches but with randoms Nintendo protect younger players.
LRTs 10/10
@Stealth___ Inti Creates have really been getting around lately.. especially after their radio silence for years.
@Stealth___ If only it was as easy to do as it is to want..
Pretty much any faith I had in Russell Brand knowing what he was talking about is quickly dissipating.
@NintenRob D':
&gt;tfw ppl call the splatoon demo a beta

the game is complete guys pls
@Wil348 JAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Finished DareDevil, what a good show it was
@TheGeniusArcana I'm glad it made sense bc that dang character limit D':
@TheGeniusArcana much laggier than shooting or racing games. Lag spikes can't be covered up with AI in them.
@TheGeniusArcana the moment the input for the move is made, AI can't fill that in nearly as much. Which is why fighting games are usually-
@TheGeniusArcana fighting games on the other hand have hundreds of moves (and in smash, positions) that need to be sent across the server-
@TheGeniusArcana the AI knows what weapon is being used and can fill in for any potential lag spikes, when someone is hit, they're hit.
@TheGeniusArcana I'm not very technically minded but how I think it works is:
in shooting games, if a certain weapon is loaded then-
@TheGeniusArcana it's cause it's a shooty game probably, easier to do hit detection on a game like that
@GlitchDeity yeah roller's not bad, I just don't think I can play my best with it
@GlitchDeity yeah I didn't give the roller much chance, the Jr. gun was so good that I didn't wanna give anything else much of a try ^^;
@GlitchDeity me neither, my brother's good with it though, also it's better on some stages than others!
@snackfrost my aim with a stick is shit but with gyro I kick ass
@wpstart yeah I went 3 mins over earlier today, it's nice they let all matches finish before kicking you off c:
Petition for @NintendoAmerica to do a huge Splatoon Tournament at E3 that they stream. Like last year's Smash Invitational!
I think the server stress test went well, I didn't get any lag and only got disconnected twice (due to my own internet)
@wpstart lucky!
lov that Splatoon, can't wait for the game to come out now.
NOO it's over ;-;

I'm very good at getting over 1000 points, most games I play I manage to do that B)
@Tracker_TD still 10 mins ;D
@wpstart I got someone with 0 points too.. what's with all the lazy ppl this evening.
@Veedramon ..uh

what

people that dumb probably wanted a reason to hate it in the first place jfc
@Veedramon it's a server stress test lmao /_\
@Veedramon what things are ppl expecting exactly? Weird.
@amiibo_helper ): sorry man
ONE PERSPN ON MY TEAM GOT 9 POINTS WHAT THE HELL. 

I got top points. And I suck with charge gun. What I do to deserve this.
ouch got owned in that one.. not great with the charge gun
@chuunisenpai ouch bad luck :/
(use the jr. gun)
@trintran Honestly not a fan of shooting games and I'm bad at them, never have been, but I was amazed at how well I did and how fun it was!
[drum noise] bang!!
@Meicrobe have been all day yeah, I don't think it'll last tho you just need to fight rollers differently to other weapons.
@geistbox happens to alla us ):
(that was opponent team btw. our team won. B) )
&gt;team with 3 rollers
&gt;getting totally owned

roller master race my ass
If there are no more Splatoon stress tests before launch they're missing a trick. It'd just be a shame to not capitalise on this hype.
@chuunisenpai NAH. SPLAT GUN JR. FTW.
@NintendoAmerica I hope you do more after this &lt;/3
@Amiibo__Fan Look dude WHATEVER you say he's doing what makes you think being a lying attention seeker yourself makes things better?
@Amiibo__Fan If you have proof sure, but that doesn't change my original point about you lying about competitions.
@Amiibo__Fan Unlike most of the internet I don't easily fall for hearsay.
@Amiibo__Fan All the competitions that user started the winners actually received their prizes, so unless you also intend on that, no.
SPLATOON TIME EVERYONE
@Amiibo__Fan I know what I meant.

I don't care what they've done to you, lying about competitions is childish and makes things worse.
@Wil348 oh.. wouldn't be surprised but it still feels too soon.
@Wil348 What's getting a remaster? o:
@GlitchDeity yeah it is a little like that now you mention it! I think it's even more smooth though, you can change sensitivity too.
@GlitchDeity I recommend giving the gyro controls a good go cause they can be rly accurate if you get used to them (unless you hate them)
@GlitchDeity it was more fun than I expected, hope you like it too c:
on the weapon select screen you can change controls too but-
@joelsei oh no ): let's just hope they do another date.
ONE HOUR 'TIL SPLATOON
@jackalopods yeah the story and character concepts are his so I think he has quite close collaboration with it
@TommyNapolitano Also I make it widely known that I vastly prefer DB to DBZ anyway, but I did like the Cell Saga more than I remembered.
@TommyNapolitano No I agree, I'm on the Buu saga atm and towards the end especially it's got so many asspulls, he gave up.
@SirCroftScion Naaah that's only around 450 episodes! If I can watch One Piece in one summer you can do that easily ;D
@jackalopods In terms of quality it should be closer to Battle of Gods (which is REALLY good, better than most of Z imo)
@jackalopods It won't be worse than GT, it's actually being written by Toriyama.
@queerarchdemon still trying to get Luigi in Mario 64 here smh
@Wil348 yeah Whatsapp will probably be fucked if the Tories have their way, they've had a problem with it for a while
@TommyNapolitano yeah exactly, it depends on the pacing and quality. Garlic Jr Saga was only 10 eps but the worst 10 eps of my life.
@Wil348 yep :l
@queerarchdemon somewhere lost in the collective consciousness of 90s kids
According to a rumour Dragon Ball Super will have like 100 episodes

who knows if that's good or bad though
@Davyb0t taken right from Melee
LRTs incredible
@Davyb0t Omg actually Fox dlc could actually happen... whoa
If more Mario Kart 8 DLC gets announced at E3 I'll be ecstatic c:
@Yoshi1up Watching some Dragon Ball, of course ;D
〜(^∇^〜）（〜^∇^)〜 
@ObsessedWithRP @27CansOfTuna as a british person: yes
Apparently UK is getting the crappy Data Surveillance Bill afterall now x_x
@kgdrv @joelsei we should have known
@joelsei splash is admittedly kinda hard to use
@TommyNapolitano extremely satisfying and addictive, imo the gyro controls make it even moreso but that's me.
@TommyNapolitano it may not be perfect content-wise to some people but it sure as hell is amazing fun.
@TommyNapolitano yeah the controls menu is a little hidden (it's when you're choosing a weapon) but I tried them
@TommyNapolitano agreed. what happened to him is really horrible but.. it's not the establishment's fault
@TommyNapolitano you can on the options, I just find the gyro controls way easier and more fun. Don't like traditional shooters so..
@psiwindftw you can I'd just love an official translation
@psiwindftw that's good at least but I wish it was translated
@kujikawaii yeah I used splat gun jr. and I kick ass with it. I ESPECIALLY kick roller ass with it.
@kujikawaii same though the gyro controls help, I was top in a fair few matches and I never do well in shooting games.
don't bother retweeting their "competitions" either, they're just making fun of another user.
btw if anyone sees an account called "Amiibo__Fan" they're a parody mocking an old amiibo account and they lie a lot. Don't believe them.
@AmiiboNewsUK I ordered Wario from them so if he's delivered safe/reliably I'll let you know.
@kgdrv not my fault ppl are scrubs &gt;:V
@kujikawaii EXACTLY

it's so easy to just run backwards while shooting oh my god
how can that many people suck against the paint roller
scrubs. scrubs everywhere.
I think ppl who say the roller is overpowered are scrubs tbh. I got tons of points against a team with 3 roller users.
@psiwindftw I'd buy if it was translated and on Steam but...
@geistbox WAT
that person understands
@Wil348 ok! will accept it later c:
@Jacobbles same I'm glad you understand my feels
@Jacobbles I love the scene where he storms the building they were filming the Mandarin footage in.
@Jacobbles Also it gets shit for not having much "Iron Man" but I love seeing how smart and resourceful Tony is, those scenes are my favs.
@Jacobbles yeah :'l
I like that movie a lot, makes me sad that it gets hate.
@Wil348 yeah I always jump to someone right after dying, gets you back in the action so quickly :D
@Wil348 you just tap on someone on the map and you jump right to them, it's handy for right after you die
@kgdrv you don't wave it you just tilt it O: you can change the sensitivity too
@kgdrv it's so much more fun and easy for me :'3
@Wil348 or using the big squid jump to assist someone right before they get killed, I love it
@Shringan182 yep only a few weeks!!
I have a good feeling that the game will have have enough content through singleplayer.
If Splatoon's singleplayer capitalises on things like platforming and satisfying squid jumps I have no reason to believe it'll be lame.
@Shringan182 ouch... man I hope there's another date for it before launch.
@Wil348 Yeah I fell through it and it to the floor below and it made me feel so giddy, I hope the singleplayer aspect has moments like that.
@jbcubed3 @C3Mush @MarzyMarrs No I didn't catch anyone I knew, I'm surprisingly not so good with the roller! Maybe need practise with it.
@kgdrv yepperoni pepperoni
@Shringan182 did you play the previous two? No way I was waking up at like 4am for the first one!
@kgdrv it has a USB port that you can plug a USB-&gt;ethernet converty thing into.
-since one of my fav things about the game is the platforming aspect and the squid swimming.
Thanks to the demo I can say with certainty that I like it much more than I thought I would, and I can't wait. I'll love singleplayer too.
To be honest I wasn't sure I'd like Splatoon I just really liked the concept and visuals, I knew my brother would like it.
@amiiboUK I ordered that earlier, will let you know if the site's reliable when it arrives ^^;
@Shringan182 I think everyone has something that works best for them which is why I'm not good at most shooting games ^^;
@Wil348 just wait til August when I kick yo' ass with the Jr. thingy.
@kgdrv I couldn't get online at all at Uni unless the connection was wired! It was a strange time but I was only at halls for a year.
To be honest if more shooting games had gyro controls I'd kick ass at them.
@Shringan182 I need the gyro, I kick ass with gyro
@kgdrv oh you have Uni internet or something?
@kgdrv hmm.. I hope it's better at 8 later then ):
That was so fun wtf. I'm gonna be a champ at this game surprisingly.
@kgdrv did you manage to play any Splatoon matches at all? If not maybe your router isn't properly compatible with it :c
I GOT 1200 POINTS IN MY LAST MATCH LMAO i'm actually good at this game I can't believe it :')))
@kgdrv aw I only got like 3..
I'm so bad at FPS and yet I'm top in most Splatoon teams I'm on. How is this happening I'm happy.
@Tracker_TD I'd kick your ass then ;D
NICE!!
this is so satisfying
@kujikawaii what's piccolo about today?
which is weird bc i usually hate shooters but the gyro controls make it just my thing
OMG I.. I REALLY LIKE SPLATOON??  HOLY SHIT
@JimSterling apparently Dark Souls did a stress test demo like this once too.
Time to try Splatoon :DD
@Tracker_TD It came free with Rainbow Curse! :D
LIFE SIZE KIRBY IS MY NEW FRIEND. 
@wpstart they can in the full game I believe, it sounds like there is a stick mode.
YO.. FOLLOW SMASHIFIED AND WE'LL GET MORE QUICKER
@wpstart same! my brother's playing first c:
SPLATOON TIME!!
@Jacobbles hopefully there's a new date soon
@Jacobbles man I'm sorry ):
@Jacobbles mine is like 1-5mb idk how that compares to yours but mine didn't take too long
@Jacobbles D: are you not home atm?
the demo isn't too big so 25 mins may be enough.
@Jacobbles godspeed ): 2nd session starts in 25 mins
@MarzyMarrs yeah I have no idea really D':
@MarzyMarrs Luckily I'm good with the gamepad ^^ I use it for Mario Kart n everything.
@Yoshi1up I don't think it was as good as the first but I heard it was ok?
@MarzyMarrs I'm not entirely sure but I think so.
@Yoshi1up 
@Yoshi1up Elebits actually did have a sequel on DS!
But uh.. Ghost Trick ):
@Dejimon11 Because the Conservatives are backwards and care about nothing but what rich people like to do.
@MarzyMarrs with any luck people will realise the bad came from tories not libdems, but I'm not holding my breath for this stupid country.
@Dejimon11 they're gonna legalise fox hunting in UK again
AUGH GADI
It's barely been a day since Tory power began and DWP have already confirmed they're cutting one disabled work scheme. Fuck??
.@Disney @kujikawaii 
I';m so angry
UGH NOOOOOOO
@chammychaplets agreed that's one of the things that upset me most about Today in general.
@chammychaplets and then maybe fight them
@chammychaplets if I was a powerful person I would go up to these people and say "h-hey there you fiend.. think about what you did haha.."
@Davyb0t oh my god I'm glad Tumblr isn't the majority wtf
Chrom is only winning bc he's ppls husbando.
@Wil348 ;_;
@Wil348 nothing makes me more squeamish than that, has sci-fi taught us nothing? D':
@psiwindftw And with a name like "Color-ado" too!
@Wil348 WTF NO
LRT UH
@Wil348 Fingers crossed that everything will be ok for you for the next 5 years :c
The Tories want to cut so much welfare ;; the ablest pricks are going to make life for disabled people so much harder than it already is
@NintenRob 3 years from now probably

OMG I'M SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ABOUT THIS
AGENT CARTER IS GETTING A SECOND SEASON TOO YESSSSS!!!!
SHIELD Season 3 confirmed! At least there's SOME good news today!
*hammers new "Welcome" sign into the ground of Britain*
*it reads "Welcome To David Cameron Hell"*
@Azuardo Yeah exactly, or at least a new charismatic and exciting left party of some sort who aren't UKIP lol.
@Azuardo nope, the independence parties associated with England are all too right, nationalistic and racist.
@Azuardo or a new left party with more charisma who can be taken seriously, for England at least.
@nicetsukki @kgdrv raichu is where it's at #Raichudan
@Azuardo the biggest right party has a much bigger chance of winning.
@Azuardo that's true, but I wonder if the choice actually helps left in this situation. More left parties and less right parties means-
@Azuardo media barely even acknowledge Green yeah :/ and I mostly mean there being 2/3 Tory opponents is maybe worse than 1 bc split votes.
@Azuardo it's a shame Labour is only the "lesser of two evils" because if there was only one good Tory opponent we'd be fine.
@Azuardo yeah basically. Tories will always vote Tory, but anti-Tories will vote any of the other two or three more left parties.
@Azuardo LibDem wouldn't have won St Ives this time even if I did vote for them.. Tory had a 2000 lead over them after Clegg's damage.
sure great idea just vote for who your family/the newspapers tell you to vote for rather than using your head and researching it. ok. :l
so so bad. People are so dumb.
@Azuardo UKIP number is terrifying but I have a feeling UKIP will never reach this height again now Farage is gone.

Here are the results of the 'Vote for Policies' survey taken by 837,000 people. 
@GoNintendoTweet oh no ;_; I hope everything will be ok
@centaurqueen thank you TvT
@centaurqueen Yeah E3 is in early June. 'Til then I'll just uh.. keep looking for jobs I guess sob.
@centaurqueen I'm just gonna wait for good video game news in a few weeks T_T
@centaurqueen same /_\
Ed Balls
Energy barrages in DBZ are so useless. 100% of the time they just make huge smoke clouds and the antagonist is totally fine. It NEVER works.
The only thing that can cheer me up now is a Nintendo E3 Event announcement.
@centaurqueen I really like the idea of being United but it's pretty clear to me now that the Tories are England's fault, no one else's.
@centaurqueen Idk about Ireland but Wales' independent party is getting bigger lately too.
@centaurqueen I guess I just feel really bad for Scotland being considered lesser than England and havin to put up w our parties.
@centaurqueen Last year I didn't want Scotland to be independent but now? I think they'd be better off, they're more progressive than us.
@centaurqueen I'm not sure how it'd effect England but after today I can't help but feel Scotland are being forced to put up with OUR shit.
@centaurqueen people were scared of that yeah but SNP wouldn't do much wrong, they're surprisingly progressive.
@centaurqueen it's a vicious cycle where only the old fashioned fascists can win.
@centaurqueen England is too proud and it's disgusting because they're kind of really pathetic about it.
@Meicrobe BAD. Old fashioned backwards party is in in full force and our health program is probably screwed now.
@centaurqueen Yep it's extremely frustrating and it will be in 5 years too &gt;&lt;
@centaurqueen They screwed up so badly :/ idiots.
@centaurqueen Yeah mine is too, used to be LibDem but Lol LibDem.
@centaurqueen Democracy is a Lie.
Ugh.
@SvendJoscelyne someone had to
I guess Mark defecting to UKIP was a little bit...
...
(•_•)
( •_•)&gt;⌐■-…
Big Ben is sad.

Me too.
LOL
@maidotsuki let me know if you find anywhere nice I'll come
@chammychaplets why could he have a weird surname like Bush
@chammychaplets my poor brother's name is Cameron, I don't think I could bring myself to do it.
"Because that posh man can't eat a bacon sandwich".
@Wil348 One of the few times I wish the internet's opinion was larger in number.
Conservatives have 325 seats now.

Not that it wasn't already inevitable.
@Wil348 I'm so angry people voted for them.
Let's just say I currently feel really bad that Scotland have to put up with England's shit lol.
Casual reminder that hundreds of Conservative MPs voted against same-sex marriage.
@Tracker_TD fucky bye etc

I hope UKIP goes away too.
To be honest if the Scottish Referendum happened now instead of last year I think the result would have been different.
Now we just need Hatsune Miku to become the new Leader of the LibDems and everything will be fine.
OH welp, speak of the devil.
Apparently Clegg is going to make a statement soon? Is he stepping down then.
@Wil348 ..But considering the vote today, they would probably be better off without England at least for their sanity.
@Wil348 yeah, I guess there's just a lingering worry that economically they would be worse off without England.
@Wil348 unless SNP really helps.
@Wil348 Unfortunately the government at large is still so England-centric that Scotland may continue to be screwed over.
Things aren't gonna change because the majority are selfish fascists who want England to be an ~empire~ again.
@Wil348 ..yeah probably :l
To be honest though it might just be time to admit to ourselves that England is just largely fascist.
In terms of UKIP, hopefully Farage resigning makes them pipe down and go away. I don't wanna see them anymore.
Also Clegg stepping down is the single best thing LibDem ca do if they want to start rebuilding their support. Should have happened already.
The thought of that scares me.
To be honest even if the current voting system is awful, UKIP would be doing far far better if it was reformed in the way people want.
@MarzyMarrs @Azuardo ugh..
@farronhat true ;;
@farronhat I just worry the only voting change choice they give us will be "current one or worse" again.
@chammychaplets I'm just disappointed in them for going through with it too, even if they lessened blows they also killed their own support.
@chammychaplets Well.. I used to be, and while I kno they were scapegoated, voting for them now would be pointless. Too much hate for them.
I think Tories only need 2 or 3 seats to majority win now. RIP UK.
@farronhat working class citizens are voting tory anyway, and they'll probably find someone else to blame if things go bad now.
@Jilvein that's part of it for sure
@chammychaplets LibDems should have seen it coming. England apparently isn't smart enough to see scapegoating if it hits them in the face.
@Jilvein old people want England to be a World Power because that's ~how it used to be~
@Jilvein only conservatives can save them lol.
@Jilvein they won't keep quiet but this country is so tory smitten that they'll blame it on something else and convince themselves that-
@farronhat You know how backwards people get, if they see protests they thing in backwards ways even harder to spite protesters.
@farronhat Yeah I think I will too, I'm getting so fed up of this. No idea if it'll do any good..
@Jilvein that's the high possibility yeah.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs but if we do and it's another situation of "current or worse" I won't be surprised.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs Chances like that are like once in a lifetime at this rate, for now I'll hope we have another chance to change voting-
@Jilvein yyyep :'l
@Wil348 Inb4 he goes back on his word and slips under the radar like a snake.
@MarzyMarrs @Azuardo The public has no "choice" in voting reform, bc they intentionally only let us choose because Bad (now) and Worse.
@MarzyMarrs @Azuardo "here's an alternative, if you don't like it oh well" and the alternative is even worse.
@MarzyMarrs @Azuardo exactly they won't change it, democracy is a lie and if enough people say "change it" they'll say-
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs they did, because it was even worse than what we have if you can imagine that.
@farronhat that's pm the only hope at this point but the harm required for people to realise is scary to think about.
@Jilvein it's unnecessarily confusing which is probably why so many people don't vote. It's to keep democracy at bay haha.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs Didn't they offer that after the coalition began and the alternative was even worse? They'll just do that again :l
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs Yep, just a shame that all of Green's votes don't mean much and they only have 1 seat as usual.
@farronhat Of course it also means that a huge majority of England still don't get how bad Conservatives are. Blech.
@farronhat The coalition seriously hurt LibDems' seats, Tory are winning in most LibDem areas now because of this.
@farronhat I'm really worried because I know most of the seats in those areas are usually Tory ;;
Can Farage resign now? Please?
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs It hurt 5 years ago but the wait was so long that ppl forgot about it and this happened 
@Tracker_TD He was boring, he did no one any good as a figurehead.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs I'll do what I can either way but I'm feeling so pessimistic right now, nothing will ever change in this country.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs I'm not sure how we can fight really. people who don't care will just be more annoyed by activism.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs Hope so, but it's so difficult to make traction last for 5 long painful years.
The Worst.
lol
Democratic Unionist Party have 184,260 votes and eight seats
LOVE THIS SYSTEM
@Jilvein basically.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs Genuinely wonder if anything can be done about it or if we really are stuck this way.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs media as Marz' said are very pro-Tory aswell. Basically ignore Green exists most of the time.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs that probably is true but it's so depressing and if they were forced to vote they'd probably vote Tory anyway.
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs But surely the rich aren't that huge a population? Things like NHS DO affect the retired.

How many Sonic fans does it take to change a light bulb?

Two. One to change it, another to say how good …
@Azuardo @MarzyMarrs I hate it. I wish there was a way to show people why voting Conservative is bad. Feels so hopeless.
@Jilvein they won't be saying that if healthcare becomes expensive instead of free
@MarzyMarrs Oh :/ do that many people still buy Newspapers?
Why are Wales and Scotland so much better than England too? Why is it just England who are Conservative-obsessed?
I don't understand it their policies screw over so many working class people so why.
seriously why is this happening can someone explain to me why so many people in UK vote Conservative :l
@SirCroftScion things will probably get even worse now
@SirCroftScion Might be time to actually consider it yep.
Feel so powerless about it all. That huge amount of Conservative votes isn't going to change no matter how much activism people do. Ugh.
england: *votes tory*
england: YOU HAVE FUCKED US OVER, SCOTLAND
#EverythingIsBad
@Jacobbles ;-;
wakes up

UK is fucked
@MarzyMarrs same here, ugh.
@Wil348 pure Conservative is even worse than coalition Conservative if that's even imaginable.
time to go to sleep so I can wake up in Conservative Hell tomorrow =_=
@Wil348 if that's true then at least one good thing has come from this disaster of an election =_=
LibDems have no one to blame but themselves for their drop in support but the Tory fate is not one I want.
Cornwall has always been LibDem lately but because of Clegg's BS and the fracking Cornwall is probably Tory now too. I'm crying.
@TheGeniusArcana they are global. Peak times for all 3 major regions had to be taken into account
i've heard of green mario but blue luigi and red luigi? this is ridiculous
lrt what..

@iD4RO 
The first game ever Kickstarted in 2009 was just released. In 2015. Wow. 
@ItsMeSamiMckee btw sorry for the "anti-nintendo bias" comment, I was heated and it was unreasonable.
If Goku was running for prime minister we wouldn't be having this problem. 
thanks Megadroid
Ed Balls
@Wil348 :)
@Wil348 jesus christ :c
[captain america voice] sorry for the bad language on this twitter feed
I'm probably gonna sleep pretty early tonight because sleeping is the best way to be blissfully ignorant of election bullshit :')
@ItsMeSamiMckee Smash is the only game to use them in the way they were originally pitched to us, would be awful if it stayed that way.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Amiibo are currently a disaster from game usage to stock, Nintendo's feigned ignorance isn't cute.
@ItsMeSamiMckee @Wil348 Fair enough. I hadn't played it much since 64 but I still think it's a shame even if I didn't play it much anyway.
@ItsMeSamiMckee I don't plan on letting their amiibo locking practises slide, but Splatoon's launch is totally fine for me.
@ItsMeSamiMckee @Wil348 when you put it that way the lack of dedicated battle tracks sounds much worse than it is.
@Wil348 @ItsMeSamiMckee I loved MK8's content too and played it for ~20+ hours but that's subjective I guess.
@ItsMeSamiMckee No you don't, like I said the amiibo locked content is awful but they're not as bad as WB by a longshot even in content.
@ItsMeSamiMckee the amiibo-locked missions in one game don't make Nintendo as bad as WB's constant games like that.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Nintendo are nowhere near as bad as WB's bullshit, not even a tiny bit close.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Splatoon's launch content may be lacking in the opinion of some but it's getting tons for free so I don't see a problem.
@ItsMeSamiMckee amiibo crap is bad esp with Splatoon but this particular conversation isn't about amiibo.
@ItsMeSamiMckee I can only call it anti-Nintendo bias then bc any other company would be much worse about it in terms of consumer screwing.
@ItsMeSamiMckee if EA, Ubi, Square, Capcom or WB were behind Splatoon you just know things would be so much worse.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Yeah it's great when fully complete games get free DLC too as I'm sure Splatoon will continue to get.
@ItsMeSamiMckee to compare Splatoon to typical AAA practises and call it "pathetic" is a huge stretch and you know it.
@ItsMeSamiMckee I'll meet you here: it's WEIRD for Nintendo to release an arguably "unfinished" game but
@ItsMeSamiMckee and unlike those games Splatoon's upcoming content is totally free.
@ItsMeSamiMckee I'm also willing to bet the average player will EASILY be able to get more value for money out of Splatoon than modern AAAs.
@ItsMeSamiMckee got cancelled the moment they were bought.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Bomberman disappeared from shelves because Konami bought and dissolved Hudson, they were still making Bomberman games that-
@ItsMeSamiMckee Bomberman on GC, PS2 and Wii etc was £40.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Yyyep.
I don't know about USA but console games have literally always been £40 or more in UK regardless of gen.
@ItsMeSamiMckee you'd likely have no issue buying it in May and enjoying the content trickle as the game gets more valuable.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Even if it's not Splatoon is hardly like Bloodborne in terms of lore or discovery. If you cared about discussion a lot then-
@ItsMeSamiMckee unlike most AAA games you aren't harmed for when you buy Splatoon
@ItsMeSamiMckee you're not expected to I'm saying it literally doesn't make a difference when you buy it lol.
@ItsMeSamiMckee they totally were.
@ItsMeSamiMckee lacking in modes =/= sucks.
People buy Bomberman games for only one reason.
@ItsMeSamiMckee Heck you could buy the game in May and leave it on the shelf still wouldn't make a difference to you as a consumer.
@ItsMeSamiMckee same way the SSMB Smash thread got hundreds of pages before the game came out?
@ItsMeSamiMckee Splatoon's singleplayer has platforming and puzzles as well as bosses, singleplayer Nintendo games are always good.
@ItsMeSamiMckee if you intend to buy the game in August you have no reason to miss out on discussion tho? These reasons are fictional.
@ItsMeSamiMckee We have literally no reason to believe it won't be.
@ItsMeSamiMckee How does it fracture the community? If anything a steady stream + huge update in August is gonna keep them coming back.
@ItsMeSamiMckee seriously please tell me how you miss out by buying the game in May. How it "harms" the consumer?
@ItsMeSamiMckee Not Titanfall.
Which had PAID dlc.

Splatoon also has a complete singleplayer mode.
@ItsMeSamiMckee if you think it shouldn't be released 'til August just ignore it before then, people who buy early aren't missing out.
@ItsMeSamiMckee If people want to they can pretend Splatoon doesn't exist til August rolls around, makes literally no difference.
@ItsMeSamiMckee DLC is all free though? And dude Splatoon still has more content on launch than The Order did AND is getting more?
@ItsMeSamiMckee So if you want to just wait to buy it in August. Don't see the problem.

Amiibo bs is the only problem with the game.
@Wil348 yep which is why often the favouring of online and dismissal of local is frustrating to me.
@mamitoomoe Ed Balls
LRT basically. LibDem lost so many supporters.

And the fracking.
@Wil348 Yeah like I know online is important to people but I pretty much never play games online, I wouldn't buy Splatoon if it had no local
@Wil348 Yeah I think this is the first time in a while a game has actually been cheaper in EU than US haha.
And Tories keep things from improving for more people just focusing on the rich white male. So annoying.
Guess it's just annoying to feel like UK will be stuck like this forever. People buy into Tory rhetoric easily bc their families vote it.
@Wil348 I'm not surprised but I have second hand frustration.
@Wil348 weird, a lot of Wii U games are doing that in EU lately and yet it's full price in US.
@Wil348 lack of local multiplayer in multiplayer-focused games has genuinely been the deciding factor for me not buying a game many times
@Wil348 perspective is important, just annoys me when one voice is favoured over another.
Cause of death: conservatives bringing UK back to the stone age
@Wil348 it got a price cut?
@Wil348 Which I think is a far bigger crime than not having lobbies and yet no one ever calls companies out for it /_\
@Wil348 That is a shame but I'm glad it's at least getting them. So many multiplayer focused games lately don't even have local multiplayer.
@Wil348 as things stand it's more like buying a short game that'll become longer and longer just by leaving it there.
@Wil348 It does seem like it was "rushed" but it'd only be fair to compare it to unfinished AAA games if all the upcoming content was paid.
@Wil348 And if you buy it in August you spend $60 on a game that has tons of content that others have been playing with less since May.
@Wil348 If you buy it in May you spend $60 on a game that'll have tons of content by August, right?
@Wil348 but once again it's not like you lose anything if you buy it early which you DO with unfinished AAA games. Comparison doesn't fly.
@photonblaze Keyblade can also choose its wielders.
@Wil348 There's literally no downside to Splatoon's situation, I don't understand the "unfinished AAA" comparisons at all.
@Wil348 Like, normally when a game is "rushed" it's bad because it affects the game forever or they have to pay extra to "finish" it.
@Wil348 Nintendo's gamescape is looking barren in first half 2015, and no one loses anything at all for it being released early.
@Tracker_TD @Wil348 I would aswell.
@memoytortas oh yeah UKIP is like that, but their popularity has grown considerably pretty quickly so they still scary
@Wil348 Maybe? So just delay the game to August or buy it and end up with the same experience by August? Still don't see the issue.
@Tracker_TD @Wil348 Tories are still winning in numbers even there :c
@memoytortas what do you mean by fringe?
@Wil348 :c
@memoytortas I can't vote for US obv but I'll still be prayin that the party that'll do the least damage wins.
Publishers protest Nintendo's plans for more Mario Kart 8 DLC 
I miss being a kid and being blissfully ignorant about the morons running this kingdom.
@memoytortas and yeah I bet in a lot of ways US has it even worse ):
@memoytortas UKIP would be worse but they never really had a chance. Tories winning just proves UK will never change or grow up.
One of those days where you can't help but feel Britain is full of idiots and will never ever change and there's nothin you can do about it.
@Davyb0t yea unfortunately not ):
@calistoyew Sounds good we'll make the animals happy and put milkshake shops everywhere.
I told myself I expected Conservatives to win but that doesn't make the reality any less detestable.
@calistoyew Let's destroy it.
@Davyb0t It's just a server stress test pretty much, online only at certain times.
Why the hell does Britain love Conservatives so much? Really depressing. I give up.
We're fucked :')

darth vadr
@heychado yeah, instead of release a more complete game in Autumn they release a small game that gets bigger for free.
@psiwindftw it's so weird to me, but it must be because it was one of the only "AAA" games released last year.
@Davyb0t I just hope he's still able to make console games too, it's a shame when good console devs leave and focus on mobile instead.
@27CansOfTuna not necessarily, but I wouldn't be surprised if a mini game version of Mario Kart happened on phones.
hmm...
Ppl are waiting so hard for Nintendo to become the next EA that they kinda lose sight of context.
I dunno all the Splatoon hate just makes me think "ppl will look for any reason to throw Nintendo under a bus"
@Dejimon11 it's not like a AAA game that feels unfinished and is added to with paid dlc, not at all.
@Dejimon11 I mean maybe it'll feel unfinished but it seems hella polished and is getting regular free updates so
@Dejimon11 Like, the alternative is waiting for Autumn for the same game w slightly more content.
@Dejimon11 yeah the amiibo thing is Bad with a capital B. Does it matter if the game is a bit rushed if it's gonna be finished for free?
And that will be upgraded to the "full" experience for free. So... what, exactly, is the problem? Not comparable to unfinished AAA at all.
Like, ok you could wait til Autumn to buy it but what's the difference? Ppl in May will be playing a smaller but still fun game for longer.
And regardless of whether you think they launched it too soon or "incomplete", it'll be "completed" for free.
Because the grand majority of "unfinished AAA" games were finished through PAID DLC.

All the content updates for Splatoon are free.
Srsly tho ppl comparing Splatoon to "unfinished AAA" games is hilarious and just shows a kinda anti-Nintendo attitude.
Holy shit the famous Shakespeare character "Mario Kart" is going to be in MCU!!! apparently he's going to be played by PSY.
@wpstart Ok phew, hope you enjoy it though! It's good fun!
@dancerbartz instead of making this art the artist couldve been doing something important like eating ice cream so it has to be worth it
@sunyshorecity maybe from stench
@Jilvein am sry ): it's hard to explain in 140 characters
@Jilvein I was makin a joke about how if spidey doesn't have an actor and martin freeman doesn't have a character they must be the same
@Jilvein MARTIN FREEMAN
@heychado Yeah exactly. Peoples' personal rules for what "deconfirms" a character are so weird lol.
@NintenRob E3 is like an early bday present every year :D
I KNEW IT
&gt;spiderman's actor isnt listed on the civil war press release
&gt;martin freeman's character isnt listed on the civil war press release

....O:
@NintenRob Same the wait's getting hard
@adadoji 
@NintenRob maybe so yeah.. I'd like if games were cheaper c:
@wpstart oh whoops, hope I didn't spoil anything for you!
.@Pokemon the one that'll take me to the Battle Frontier and let me rematch Gym Leaders in OmegaRuby/AlphaSapphire! :)))))
@NintenRob it's been a year of smaller games so far I guess.
I'd be fine paying full price for it anyway and the singleplayer mode does look really cool but if ppl think it's "incomplete" then..
Apparently one reason ppl are annoyed about Splatoon is bc it's full price in US (it's not in Europe).
@yasumiwatahashi We all know why those locations are being sidelined and it makes it even more frustrating /_\
@BrambleBlossom Creative differences which after 8 years of development is a bit worrying.
@SoulDrill I think we'll get a teaser before the year is up yeah.
@yasumiwatahashi pretty much anything further east. It'd be so samey.
@yasumiwatahashi There's already been ones in America and then Black Flag so yeah an England one would be super boring compared to-
@BrambleBlossom I'm going anyway but if it doesn't do well Marvel has noone to blame but themselves for messing around the crew.
@yasumiwatahashi all this doesn't fill me with confidence about how hard they're working on new games D:

Seriously?? Unity isn't even fixed yet.
Guess there's no Spider-Man casting information today afterall. Hopefully not long though..
@BrambleBlossom especially since Edgar Wright walked and the film's vision was changed heavily last minute.
@BrambleBlossom the marketing so far has been uncharacteristically weak for a Marvel film so I worry about the film's quality too.
@TommyNapolitano Yeah I know what you mean ): Banjo-Kazooie's fate will always feel like such a shame to me.
@BrambleBlossom I hope it will aswell, but right now I'm not very optimistic.
@eagc7 I figured Age of Ultron was retconning it from canon.
@eagc7 The main reason it surprised me is that Age of Ultron acted like Hulk had never rampaged in public before which isn't true.
@TommyNapolitano It's also a lot more likely unfortunately. Banjo-Kazooie are only ever "opposition advertising" to Nintendo now.
@wpstart He's the core protagonist as well as the leading Avenger now.
@TommyNapolitano yeah Universal still have distribution rights for the Hulk film franchise. Which confuses things for a solo movie.
@TommyNapolitano Yeah, I think a new Hulk movie with Ruffalo could be amazing tho. As for Spidey.. I'm still worried haha.
@TommyNapolitano I heavily prefer it to Hulk 2008 and Thor Dark World
If Ant-Man (movie) or Paul Rudd's portrayal of the character are considerably unpopular they'll probably stop using him after Civil War.
@TommyNapolitano yeah it wasn't too great, it was like glorified exposition haha. Still liked it though.
@centaurqueen Yeah I imagine it'll get bigger still.. and yeah Falcon was so cool in Winter Soldier so I'm rly happy about this.
@TommyNapolitano well hey Winter Soldier was amazing
At this point Civil War is basically another Avengers movie.
@centaurqueen 
@centaurqueen 
@centaurqueen that's my main worry. The cast is so huge I can't help but worry a bit..
@centaurqueen yeah in the 90s and 00s they thought "we'll never make our own movies let's licence our most popular ones out to people"
@centaurqueen Yea I have a feeling she'll be around even more from now on so I have high hopes for Civil War..
@centaurqueen I still want it to happen but apparently it's bc Universal still have distribution rights for Hulk ):
@centaurqueen I loved seeing it too but I guess I just don't really see them as a couple, I think Natasha could open up in other ways too
@centaurqueen also bc ngl I'd rather Bruce and Betty were a thing than Bruce and Natasha.
@centaurqueen I thought it wasn't either and I'm ok with either way I was just sad for Bruce's backstory all being potentially trashed
It's sad that Ant-Man being in Civil War is making me more excited for Ant-Man. It proves Marvel haven't given people confidence in it.
@SoulDrill yep.. I'm guessing Vibranium factors into the plot or something.
@centaurqueen I wouldn't mind if Betty came back since I feel bad for all of Bruce's supporting cast disappearing lol
@adadoji metoo spiderman
I'm bored so I'm gonna compare the casts of Ultron and Civil War and see which is bigger :l
TFW HULK 2008 IS STILL CANON. I wonder if Betty will come back soon too?
source on all this btw; 
@SoulDrill William Hurt played Thunderbolt Ross in Hulk 2008 and is back as him in Civil War, just a small role but still.
That's amazing when I saw Ultron I assumed Hulk 2008 wasn't canon anymore but William Hurt is returning as General Ross.
AND GENERAL ROSS FROM HULK 2008 IS RETURNING?? HULK 2008 IS STILL CANON????
holy shit Vision and Ant-Man confirmed for Civil War

this cast is bloody huge
@kujikawaii darn you paradoxes!
As if it's fact? Next they'll be saying Toon Link's appearance on the Spirit Tracks stage deconfirms him. WAIT.
Seriously why are people saying the Inkling Mii costumes affect the chances of Inklings being proper Smash DLC. Lol.
Splatoon is trending worldwide, awesome.
配信は2015年夏、価格は未定です。

@InfernoOmni with any luck, more dates and times for Splatoon will be announced anyway. Good luck!
heck at least you whiners are GETTING lobbies. Tons of games I wanna play in multiplayer locally I can't and apparently that's ~fine~ :^)
@psiwindftw local multiplayer should be in games that don't have it from the start
A multiplayer focused game with no local options should be a crime and yet they're more and more common + people don't complain.
Ok but why are ppl complaining that lobbies aren't available at launch when no one complains about games that don't have local multiplayer?
@psiwindftw It does a half-assed job of being an MMO
@psiwindftw o.. I'm just glad it's happening at all, Destiny never got offline multiplayer even after launch :^)
Is Splatoon really getting hate? I'm glad bc none of that's appearing on my TL. Everyone here is appropriately #hyped.
@psiwindftw the only bad thing about Splatoon imo is the missions you need amiibo to play. Besides that it's 100% great imo.
Oh yeah also, #IVoted
After today I'm even more sure that there will be no mainseries Pokémon game this year.
@bomairinge nope just making an educated guess. No way they'd make it only a one day event when there's still 3 weeks til launch.
@bomairinge I'm sure there will be more dates announced for each week.
Downloading Splatoon Demo now c:
@Wil348 I like to hope that if the game is supported long-term the amount of free considerable content updates will outweight the amiibo.
person: oh my GOD. nintendo wasting my time AGAIN!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! !!!! WHERES NEW METROID?? ST…
@Wil348 the amiibo stuff is already ondisc, I can't really defend that.

But regular free content updates is somethin more devs should do.
@C3Mush same
@Wil348 I'm just glad the free DLC is far more considerable than the amiibo locked stuff.
@C3Mush as far as I know it's just a limited online demo.
@Tracker_TD Inklings still have a good chance imo.
@NintendoUK This is really cool! But it'd be amazing if Inklings themselves were a dlc character eventually!
Demo isn't up on Europe yet.
It's a shame you can only play it for a limited time but it should be hype.
Let's see if I can find dat Splatoon demo.
#eSplats
esports are over

now there is only #SquidSports
Needless to say I am sufficiently hyped for #Splatoon now holy crap.

SOO MUCH FREE DLC
#Splatoon confirmed for the new 2Fort.

Or should I say... ToonFort.
@TheJWittz @photonblaze Mii costumes don't deconfirm anything, Link costume is already out.
@dancerbartz I just thought it was a shame ):
@rvaliantine Sonic After The Sequel's OST (if you haven't already) is A++++
@C3Mush I don't think it does considering there are Mii Fighter costumes for Link/Mario/etc
that advert is kinda cheesy
Even if they're not actual Inklings you better believe I'm hyped for the Inkling Mii costumes in Smash4.
Inkling costumes for Smash but no actual Inklings.

That's kind of a shame but still cool and unexpected
THE SQUID IDORUS ARE BACK
It's kind of a shame that content is locked behind the amiibos though :/
JESUS TONS OF FREE STAGES
squid idorus
..ok the single player mode actually looks pretty great
the music in this game is so cool
whoa it's over already and inkling confirmed for mortal kombat
@Dejimon11 nevr
only 5 seconds until Golden Sun 4-10 get confirmed and also Isaac in Splatoon on a monocycle. #hype
@kujikawaii didn't they say on the press release that Metroid was a household name

lol
I can't believe Shulk is gonna be confirmed for Splatoon in 10 minutes
@photonblaze that'll be the day
Splatoon Direct Debit
@nicetsukki omg good point
@nicetsukki I believe in you and then maybe we can destroy mewtwo
@Veedramon inb4 ash IS charizard y
@Veedramon WTF
@nicetsukki omg good luck with mega gengar
@kujikawaii nice
@InfernoOmni Which is exactly why I make comparisons in the first place. Pokémon creative process = damned if they do damned if they don't.
@InfernoOmni As far as I'm concerned someone who hates the creative process behind Foongus would hate Voltorb if Voltorb was new.
@InfernoOmni I don't hate on the originals I just hate on the mindset that they're superior when the ideas used now are totally faithful.
whoa
If ya give stalactites crap you may aswell give Graveler crap too. Graveler is gravel.
Everyone gives Vanillite-Vanilluxe line crap bc it looks like an ice cream but it's a stalactite guys. It's not a literal ice cream.
@wevles It genuinely kinda frightens me that real people who actually exist support them
@InfernoOmni Vanillish isn't even an ice cream it's a stalactite, just as creative as Geodude if not moreso.
LRT oh my god??

#ElectionDay 
@InfernoOmni I like a mix of new ones and new evolutions of old Pokémon like we usually get.

@schillingc @trintran Bone-Dry Dunes, Cheese Land and Mario Circuit.. probably
And I don't feel like losing out on sleep just so I can see UK remind everyone of how backwards and conservative they are.
I won't be staying up for election results tonight. I'm disenchanted as it is with the illusion of democracy.
@NintenRob there are but they're much rarer, it's kinda funny

gimmie that original 721 :^)
@RaqibMarvelous hell yeah
@kgdrv Ooh I didn't think about that.

I don't think the chances are too high but it's possible.
@TheGeniusArcana I'm nervous just thinking about it
@smashified "Isaac Breaks New Ground!" #IsaacForSmash
lmao
@Stealth___ And the press are still making negative spins on it of course. Incredible.

keep sleeping.
@Stealth___ Super Mario Maker and the Incredible Create-Arama Boogaloo
@Wil348 Yep ): 9.56 million so far.
LRT exactly
@MarzyMarrs Shibata for prime minister!
@NintenRob Yeah wouldn't be surprised.. a lot of my friends have been blocked already so I'm very thankful to still be ok!
@NintenRob Probably for the best
@NintenRob here's hoping you don't get blocked :P
@princeofrot they're gonna turn up all like "give us money for mgs5"
Of course, press always have to put a negative spin on Nintendo news :/ #Doomed @NintenRob
@SirCroftScion Yeah I kno I just vaguely recall his son being caught for plagiarising a few years ago.
regular game Direct because the earnings report was mostly positive for once.
So, either the Splatoon Direct is gonna have big news because it's right after the earnings report earlier, or it's gonna be just a-
@SirCroftScion No I didn't but isn't that the same guy who was caught plagiarising manga art a while back?
@SirCroftScion Why do you think these things will die soon?
@SirCroftScion yep, the gaming landscape changes a lot and this is my least fav landscape ever. Hope it changes again soon P:
@nicetsukki I'm sure when you do get it it'll be very happy C:
@SirCroftScion The thing that hurts is that GC sold 20mil in the time it's taken Wii U to sell 9mil ;v;
Wii U still hasn't hit 10mil sales.. expected, but still sad. Poor console, it deserves so much better.
@Tracker_TD yeah that's confirmed but the thing about it expiring on December is the thing that confused people.
@MegaMan Currently really hoping it comes to EU PSN too, I'd buy it in an instant &lt;3

@kinucakes @MikeZSez I hope the @PlaytonicGames guys see this. They value transparency so I'm sure they wouldn't object to this critique.
they change your neutral game
@Stealth___  I bet they're waiting to use it to soften any Financial Result negatives that may be revealed this week.
@memoytortas it just came out there today!
@memoytortas  It's already out in US! Which is what prompted me to make the Tweet ^^;
@amiibo_helper could be a Twitter glitch loading the follower numbers improperly.
Thank you PT your sacrifice was not in vain &lt;/3
@GetMeOffTheMoon now to pray for a European release!!
I really hope The Misadventures of Tron Bonne comes out on European PSN ;-;!! @Capcom_UK I'd buy it in a heartbeat!
Kirby plushie has been delayed ;-;
@Capcom_Unity @MegaMan I hope it comes to Europe! I really want it! ^^
@joelsei I KNOOOW  it makes me so happy
DBZ Narrator: "Goku is alive. Barely."
*goku has a halo above his head he's already been dead for the whole arc get it together narrator*
@maidotsuki Yeah I really enjoyed the mini-arc that introduced Videl, I wish there was more stuff like that.
What I'm tryna say is: I want to see Kuririn kick someone's ass again like in the old days.
It's not really fair that throughout the series they became less and less relevant and there was no point to them even fighting.
Like.. Yamcha, Tien, Kuririn, Chiaotzu, Videl, even Piccolo. Sure they're not Saiyan-level strong but they're still REALLY strong.
One thing I really hope Dragon Ball Super does is actually give the non-Saiyan characters screentime and development.
@riivalee @maidotsuki also Shovel Knight was gr8
@riivalee @maidotsuki me too, the dev team is basically the exact same ppl who made DKC and Banjo-Kazooie. Almost every key member.
@riivalee @HunterZHunterZ that makes sense ): cheap buggers
@HunterZHunterZ @riivalee if only ;-; one piece's animation just gets worse and worse, it's supposed to be the most successful anime ever.
@HunterZHunterZ @riivalee lov that death parade

If you're a same-sex marriage advocate and you're voting Tory: what's wrong with you
@maidotsuki always :l
Last year ORAS was announced as damage control, that was a really good distraction from all the "DOOOOOMED" stuff.
If Nintendo's Earnings report is negative again I fully expect awesome damage control announcements within the next couple weeks.
Unless he loses to Farage that'd be like out of the frying pan and into the fire (aw yea overused proverbs)
If David Cameron loses the election I'll probably wake up from that good dream and realise real life was the nightmare all along.
@ruukutia single best cutscene in ORAS confirmed
@ruukutia maybe it's actually come to delivery a swift whack round the head with its mailbag. )':
@Raittgun I can't beat it ever T_T
@ruukutia YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
That's our Pokémon game for the year guys. A Special Dragonite.
@Veedramon yeah the fact we wouldn't be surprised says a lot abt how much faith we have in Konami.
Ok PT isn't actually being deactivated later this year that's a PS+ expiry date.
@Tracker_TD ohhh phew
Oh my god @Konami :l

We're approaching the Gam…
逆の対比になってて泣きそうになってきた 



@Yoshi1up I think she's like really old.. she would be everyone's senpai.
Guys don't forget to follow Smashified.. if loads of ppl follow it they'll finish the next one faster :') (maybe it's Isaac)
@chammychaplets it was never referenced before or after that point ever it was so freakin weird. maybe it was literal "filler hell".
@chammychaplets was that the one with the really weird black and white alternate world thing that made no sense
@riivalee Yeah that's true.. I am a bit worried about Dragon Ball Super though.
@RaqibMarvelous what did they do?
@Davyb0t I'm ok with waiting for the PS3 releases though c:
@27CansOfTuna I think it will bc of the official subbed trailer but.. I'm worried it won't be dubbed ;_;
@Davyb0t I do have the beta but only my brother plays it since my laptop is no good for gaming ^^;
@Davyb0t he only came out here last night so I only just got to see his palettes O:
AND A WOLVERINE PALETTE + CAPTAIN AMERICA PALETTE THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
AND A BATMAN PALETTE JFC
@Meicrobe yeah ;__;
@Meicrobe Maybe you're right, either way I hope the quality to be higher than a series would be.
@Goku I think maybe she's actually younger than Pan and GT just got it wrong.
@Meicrobe same, it's weird that they do it with anime..
@Veedramon I can't wait that long!! Shenmue 3 will be out by then.
@riivalee That's at least 5 years of pain ;__;
OH MY GOD BEOWULF HAS A BIG BOSS PALETTE
@27CansOfTuna a year is a long time ): but at least the subbed version of p3m was released quickly.
Waiting a week for episodes of a show you like is hard enough. Waiting months/years for movies??? Evil.
@27CansOfTuna *me in pain*
@27CansOfTuna how long did they take to get dubbed?
@Veedramon The subtitled version is from Toei's official YouTube so they'll probably at least make a subbed release but.. I want dub ):
It'd be such a shame if western fans have to wait ages for the Digimon Tri movies to be localised :c
Besides Dragon Ball movies, anime movies typically take YEARS to be localised ;-;
The most worrying thing about this is I thought Digimon Tri was gonna be quickly localised for Western fans.. but
That's gonna take forever to finish then ;_;
WHAAAAT
whaaaaaat
Is Digimon Tri really not airing 'til November? Dang that's so far away if true :S
@demonsvenom a more grounded or human story than normal or something.
@demonsvenom Yeah, I'm sure the series will be good but the artist choice is a bit confusing unless they really wanted to make it
@demonsvenom yeah it's pretty and I do like it I'm just not sure it fits Digimon since the old Digimon style is so cartoony and varied
My Digimon Feels 
Why do Toei get all the good animes.

They treat One Piece's animation so badly that I can't trust them to handle Digimon or Dragon Ball.
Now I just need a PV for Dragon Ball Super and I'll be happy.
@Veedramon I'm gonna wait for proper translations before I worry I guess
@Veedramon yeah what the actual f
It's cool that Omnimon will be back though.
The animation on Digimon Tri looks nice but I still don't know how to feel about the artstyle the charas look kinda sameface.
@Veedramon maybe it's just my internet sobs

it's lagging out constantly
@Veedramon 
@bomairinge nope.. for now I think it's a mystery.
Watching laggy streams is worse than watching no streams
Time to finally get my Beowulf on.
@riivalee Yeah it's almost scary. Even Vita is way faster than PS3 though.. I wish they updated it.
PS Store still takes sooo long to load on the PS3
@Dejimon11 it was very repetitive but hey it was super memorable

I still prefer the Japanese OP though, it has a really nice melody.
@Meicrobe How Can Our Tweets Be Real If Jaden Isn't Real ):
I still want Jaden Smith to come back to Twitter :(
digimon
digital monsters
digimon are the Chain-Chompions!!!!!!!!!!
this Digimon stream is really laggy for me ):


+ @smashified are the guys behind these amazing so-good-it-looks-real fan renders so rly theres no good reason not to 
DO IT GUYS FOLLOW THE SMASHIFIED TWITTER. TELL UR FRIENDS TO FOLLOW IT TOO!!
Nothing would hype Splatoon like Inkling in Smash would.
If Nintendo don't confirm Inkling as Smash DLC in the next month or so to promote Splatoon, they're seriously missing an amazing trick.
I know I usually say SSB4 has enough characters and Fighter DLC is not as important as stage DLC to me but
@NintenRob it's preparing itself for the reality of bad sales &lt;/3
@Joshawott @Bulbagarden thought the same thing when I saw the bundles
E3 hype hit me while I was trying to sleep last night. How annoying!
The Pokémon bundle kinda backs up the likelihood of there being no new Pokémon game this year.
@Joshawott @Bulbagarden Yeah I'm currently under the assumption that if it doesn't get announced in May it's not happening at all this year.
I agree, and I don't think we'll see one at E3 either because that would be a first. @Joshawott @Bulbagarden
[captain america voice]

sorry for the bad language


pls guess what will be revealed at E3 next
LRT omfg
gamers these days... so overly sensitive and easily offended! /snrk
@yugiohtas that sounds like something straight out of Batman &amp; Robin to be honest
#HowToSpotAFeminist if u kno a decent person who wants women to be as respected as men there's a p decent chance they are one (:
kevin cassidy-senpai noticed me
@photonblaze it's a bit of an easter egg! I discovered it by accident as a kid.. probably
@Wil348 Yeah, he's been in a lot of big roles lately but I think he's perfect for a modern iteration of it.
"I /knew/ that Captain N guy didn't know how to write me! I still have no idea who this Icarus guy even is!" 
@jackalopods closest thing CD got to a sequel was Sonic 4 Ep2.. and it made us realise it's probably better off without a sequel.
@jackalopods I think the JP OST's time came and went with the Taxman remake a few years back.
@Wil348 ..ok this would honestly be really great
@jackalopods yeah the cartoon's good fun, luckily most people who watch it either don't know the game or blotted it from their mind.
@jackalopods true as hell
@jackalopods At least the Boom cartoon is entertaining.
@jackalopods Namco tried to give Pac-Man a "modern rebrand", didn't work out. You'd think SEGA would have learnt a thing from that.
old news, the ROB amiibo prototype's been around since the 80s! /kappa @GoNintendoTweet 
@jackalopods yep so much weird production stuff going on with that one, it was a huge shame how it turned out to be honest.
@jackalopods yeah especially in crossover games there are lots of legal nightmares, smash is already impressive in that aspect.

@jackalopods that and namco would probably rather use all their own music rather than giving someone else royalties if they can help it
@jackalopods not domestic. Japanese dev teams don't need to search out rights to use western music when they have many other options.
[SHINY PONYTA VOICE] YEAAH YEAAH EYAAAH EYAAAH YEAHHH YEAAH THERE IT IS THERE IT IS YEAAAAH YRSAHAAHA
HYPERVENTILATES @Tracker_TD @AmiiboNews
@jackalopods I'm guessing they wouldn't have the immediate rights since it's not a Namco-made song.
I can't believe The Hobbit is part of MCU now
@jackalopods Smash Ballot's results won't be revealed until October I think. Captain Syrup getting more rep would be awesome.
@jackalopods I think that's what they were referencing, it was a funny event too
@jackalopods Yeah I'd love that, I'm sure they could make some alternate version of them for the events since giga bowser was in melee.
@jackalopods yeah Mewtwo wasn't too bad but Giga Bowser was very unique and intimidating
@jackalopods they weren't bad but I think they were the least memorable. Melee's are still the best and most unique events imo.
@Tracker_TD 
@Tracker_TD 
I S A A C

OH NO
@jackalopods I just wish there was an event like the Captain Falcon speedrun one in Melee :')

uh oh goodbye world
@photonblaze nope, been in since Smash 64!
@photonblaze press A+B!
oh no
@jackalopods maybe it's our playstyles then cause I was able to beat most of the ones you described already hehe ^^;
@adadoji [steve voice] language
When is Disney Infinity 4.0 Touhou Edition coming out.
@jackalopods the one I can't beat is the event match with a bunch of the Newcomers in it.
@jackalopods haha that's true
@alternisdim wtf sakurai.. how dare you put in shulk but not chrom.. they're literally identical except chrom is cooler )':
@jackalopods I've managed to beat True AllStar but some of the events are way too hard still ):
Remember when some people saw Shulk's Smash trailer and thought Metal Face was Eggman
@jackalopods I'm already unhappy unfortunately so that may not change much :V
@TheJob80318 go away
@jackalopods I do! but I don't get to play it very often unfortunately ): too busy job hunting haha.
Why is Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 not coming to Wii U... 3 and 4 were both on GC.

Oh well it probably won't be any good anyway.
I can't wait for the "Dragon Ball and Sonic Cinematic Universe" to kick off. :)
@farronhat "toby maguire really captured the joy of having an old man play a 15 year old so we are delighted to take that even further"

@bomairinge They've stopped trying because they know people will buy any game they say is "AAA" anyway.
@bomairinge yep, Ubisoft are the best example of this bc Watch_Dogs, AC Unity and The Crew all blundered in one year.
@bomairinge that's the mindset I can't stand, devs have convinced themselves that games with lesser budgets are inferior/not worth making.
@bomairinge a lot of modern devs seem to think that being able to call a game "AAA" or "cinematic" is more important than quality.
@bomairinge nah it makes sense to me, and there are games where the budget has helped the experience (GTA) but
@bomairinge happy if gaming ever returned to a point where devs didn't feel the need to 1up Hollywood budgets with all of their releases.
@bomairinge "AA" games to me are just games with a focus on gameplay over budget. That's how gaming has always been to me and I'd be very-
@bomairinge Yeah, Old Blood being released reminded me of it. Blood Dragon and First Light also come to mind as being great ideas.
Smaller, cheaper games are viable and I wish the games industry would recognise this especially when variety is so scarce atm.
Maybe there will come a day when we can respect them as "AA" games rather than calling them "standalone expansions" at all.
as well as proving that a game doesn't have to be "AAA" to be a viable and quality release. I'd like to see more of them.
To be honest standalone expansions are a genuinely great idea in the modern games industry. They add some much-needed variety-
Oh dang Kirby was dispatched! But not the Kirby plushy ):
@Squidboards I thought it was on the 7th..?
Nowhere's reported on that Famitsu Pokémon announcement thing so I'm guessing it's just a hoax.


@Wil348 I don't think they'd have bothered localising P&amp;Z at all if they weren't gonna give it more meat. JP and West have different tastes.
@Wil348 Tetris has been marketed and sold by different publishers for well over 20 years tho
@Wil348 I don't think anything about P&amp;Z is considerably worse than what any puzzle game has done in the past esp for 2 in 1 at budget price
@Wil348 Keep in mind the original version of Tetris had been free software on PCs since 1984 and still is.
@Wil348 P&amp;Z on mobile is a simple f2p puzzle game w microtransactions and P&amp;Z 3DS has full singleplayer puzzle games w/ RPG elements
@Wil348 especially when we still get boxed versions of Tetris selling for higher than that and P&amp;Z 3DS is hugely expanded from the mobile 1s
@Wil348 Maybe they should have offered them separately for $10 each but the consensus is that $30 for both is a good deal.
@Jacobbles ppl are rly disappointed with how he wrote Black Widow in Ultron and he's been getting hate for it. Idk if that's why he left tho
@Wil348 plus in Japan Puzzle &amp; Dragons Z is sold as a separate 3DS game and it did incredibly in sales as well as got good reception.
@Wil348 puzzle games like tetris have always had full console releases alongside cheaper digital releases
@Wil348 it doesn't have any microtransactions and comes with two puzzle games in one though?
nice


@Jacobbles hahaha it actually sounds like one
"The Milking Begins"

@sayakugh I LOOOVE IT
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 If by some miracle Green gets another seat I'll consider joining your train of thought P:
I'm not buying that supposed Famitsu news until it's clarified by Serebii. Too many Pokémon hoaxes the last few months.
@photonblaze He was the main villain in 4 DK games c:
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 I suppose I can see where you're coming from, I'm just not at all optimistic about it. Like voting to a brick wall.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 precisely, but our political system is so obtuse that voters don't want to think for themselves.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 If Tory get in again (and they will) I'm going to end up wishing I voted Labour (but I'm not going to anyway)
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 That pride is always going to be contesting with the "vote tactically" part of me. No satisfaction there really.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 The fact it's gotten to the point where Tory is a "safe vote" for so many people in England is extremely disheartening.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 I mean I have friends from oppressed minorities who vote Tory bc "it's family tradition". Ppl aren't willing to think.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 that's how Tories and Republicans have been getting power since forever :/ people gullibly buy that misinformation shit.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 The fact this happened at all has really cut my optimism for England being progressive.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 UKIP came out of nowhere and already has more support than Greens have ever had, they're the new BNP except popular.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 can't currently believe there are more progressives, esp after the last EU election was a continent-wide nationalism-fest
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 England is just way too right-nationalistic, Tory+UKIP supporters make up almost half of the voters combined.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 Greens have been around for decades and they've never made an inch. I vote for them anyway but it's useless.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 everyone has their own idea of first steps and bc their isolated voices aren't loud enough no change will happen.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 I really like the sentiment of first steps believe me but there's no right answer, we lose no matter what we choose.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 UKIP/Tory's combined supporters will ALWAYS be higher than the supporters of "change", and "change" has no name either.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 I mean who in England can make positive change that people will want? People are either Nationalistic or confused.
@Azuardo @jbcubed3 Which is why I said "reality" bc the portion of people set in their ways is too high for voting for change to be possible
@jbcubed3 @Azuardo I'm not voting either of them anyway but I know my vote won't mean shit and tories will still get into power.
@jbcubed3 @Azuardo At this point lesser of two evils is the only positive outcome anyway :/ that's the crap reality we have to deal with.
@TheGeniusArcana oh yeah in that case I totally agree, the comic stuff is nuts confusing I don't know why they wouldn't actively avoid that

@neuropsychic holy shit
@offensearmour I can't believe this has happened :'((
@TheGeniusArcana and Marvel has only one universe.. at least in the films.
@offensearmour HIS TWITTER IS GONE  ;-;
@TheGeniusArcana agreed, a little worried
@TheGeniusArcana the bad kind of shit or the good kind?

@Dejimon11 I don't think the Pokémon Company would be able to comprehend that level of success..
@Dejimon11 doesn't help that Pokémon Rumble is kinda boring
@TommyNapolitano yeah I'd really like that! I'd love to see the 3DS stages on the Wii U version too..
Smash 4 rly needs stage DLC ):
@kujikawaii nowadays I destroy more anime than I watch
Nintendo: "ummm sweetie how can we be expected to know amiibo would sell well if you haven't been buying Wii Us? :/"
Nintendo: "thing is guys the wii u was selling so badly we just assumed amiibo would do just as bad if not worse" /passive aggression


Shulk amiibo you will be mine. 
@Dejimon11 $15 is still pretty good (at least compared to UK prices) but good luck!
@Dejimon11 how much is she online?
I've accepted it but I'm still really annoyed about it. Why are UK so dumb.
By now I've accepted that Conservatives are just going to win again no matter what we do and I no longer fear death.
@Dejimon11 how about online on like amazon and gamestop and stuff?
&gt;splatoon direct on election day
&gt;tfw inkling is gonna be prime minister


@Dejimon11 I always thought Smash Peach was rly common
@VESPlQUEN joss whedon's ass probably
Also I bet the statement just came bc Nintendo's social media employees were fed up of every reply on FB/Twitter being "where's the amiibos"
I'm glad Nintendo finally commented on the amiibo situation in detail but when are they going to comment on giving me a Shulk amiibo.
@Wil348 I don't entirely disagree but Return of the Jedi isn't that much worse than the other two imo.
lmao goku
@amiibofiguresuk ridiculous, and to think I used to use @shoptonet for their good prices.
That persistent Pokémon Yellow hoax is floating around again I see.
@TommyNapolitano I bet he's not in the mood anymore
I can see it now.. 

"Her Royal Highness Princess #RoyalBaby of Cambridge"

it's perfect
@TommyNapolitano RIP Diddy
Still disappointed that the #RoyalBaby wasn't named "#RoyalBaby". Democracy has failed.

@brightwingstaff "you're :/"
And regardless of whether or not I personally care about a "revolution" it makes Brand seem more naive than he wants us to believe he is.
Ppl are allowed to change their minds but I can't see a revolution of any kind coming out of this. Labour are pretty "status-quo" intensive.
he wants people to "vote the lesser of two evils" and vote Labour? Which is what people have already been doing for decades.
Russel Brand's been talking for years about starting the revolution by abstaining from voting and suddenly-

@Veedramon not even doom music

@riivalee I think Fox and Disney would be open to a crossover movie but I doubt they'll ever be in the same universe on Disney film ;-;
@ichinomiyachan I will pray 4 u and let you know if it pops up anywhere in the next few months!
@riivalee Yep besides Inhumans which have very mutant-like struggles in SHIELD atm
@Davyb0t if you have good internet/are patient with loading that site loads eps in 720p which is very nice! Enjoy!
@ichinomiyachan fingers crossed the reprinted version will go international soon
@Davyb0t 
@riivalee I agree plus I loved his character in it :c I'm really hoping he's brought back.
@MikeCam no major superheroes in it but Quake has a major role, Deathlok is in it a fair bit and Inhumans everywhere.
@MikeCam The plot was originally day to day SHIELD fieldwork and then it became SHIELD vs Hydra bc Winter Soldier affected it big time.
@riivalee if quicksilver was important to future movies they wouldn't have let him do it. Or they'll just bring him back as it was so vague.
@MikeCam I'm almost surprised it wasn't, but luckily it's in its second season now and it's getting better and better
@GlitchDeity yeah I have a few I really wanted like the Majora's Mask one but besides that I mostly just have free ones hehe
What would be more fair is if Avengers marketed SHIELD. Bc SHIELD is really good and is also nowhere near as popular as Avengers.
Avengers is one of the most successful franchises ever and you wanna market it to the people who are only watching the show because of it?
Another thing that annoys me is like. Sometimes SHIELD acts like glorified Avengers marketing. Avengers doesn't /need/ that marketing.
@riivalee non-canon then it's non-canon regardless of what Whedon thinks
@riivalee I just never figured he had that much control over the over-arcing stuff, only his own films. If Marvel want SHIELD to be-
@GlitchDeity I'm very bad at spending little bits of money ^^;
So I really hope that's just Whedon ranting and not actually true.
I for one would love to see Coulson alive again in the MCU films. I really hate the idea that the TV shows aren't canon to the movies.
@chuunisenpai wanted to help Ant-Man fit in, I'm sure they could have taken more control over AoU if SHIELD was fully canon.
@chuunisenpai ofc if later MCU movies prove that wrong I'll be really happy but considering they made Wright walk for not doing what they-
@chuunisenpai and ultimately since Marvel controls the MCU they'd have final say on if SHIELD was canon or not, not Whedon.
@chuunisenpai I got the opposite impression, I thought that he brought Coulson back in the show and THAT's what annoyed Marvel
@chuunisenpai he did go about it in a weird way but I think not acknowledging SHIELD is Marvel's fault which annoys me most
me every time I go to the 3DS theme shop "im tempted to get this" *gets nothing*
@chuunisenpai he actually was more annoyed about that than anyone

@Emi1yRogers they promise to focus on finetuning the game rather than promising more and more, unlike the MN9 $$$ situation.
@Emi1yRogers this is precisely why I like this latest update from them;

@snowhaired That's probably a better name than Swoobat tbh
@Dejimon11 hahaha wouldn't be surprised
@Dejimon11 The Banjo demo you mean?
@NintenRob Yeah Noibat is adorable
I think in terms of appearance Laylee looks more like Swoobat than Noibat.. but Noibat is closer in colour I guess.
terrifying 
I could believe that.

Still.. if it's anything like that Kinect-only Banjo demo they showed a few months ago, I won't be interested.
The craziest E3 prediction I'll make is 2 Metroid games and Golden Sun 4. And I'm sticking with it.

It's also wishful thinking.
@NintenRob "Ice Climbers Uprising: Featuring Duck Hunt from the Duck Hunt Series"
I miss Ice Climbers T_T
@Stealth___ In terms of game dev Playtonic are probably the single most trustworthy team to ever make a Kickstarter
@Stealth___ I agree but Playtonic absolutely know what they're doing. Their teams were around this size in the N64 days + had these ppl.

@C3Mush @Amiibo_Fan @DiceRetroGamer Shulk T_____T
@thebonetones it used to all be there too which makes things even more confusing
@thebonetones which is kinda dumb because it's totally separate from all the other settings pages.
@thebonetones you go onto your main twitter page 
@creamyvelvet it's increases in trends like this that are really killing my interest and enjoyment in gaming.
How to not do DLC:
- announce season pass before game is out
- hold back key story content
- charge for content that should be in the game
How to do DLC:
- release a complete game with nothing missing
- release missing things for free
- announce dlc after game is released
So basically the basic game is incomplete and you have to buy DLC to get the full story? Lmao.
"Play as Batman’s key allies in narrative missions extending their storylines, from both before and after the events in Arkham Knight."

Or Warner Bros. if they're forcing Rocksteady's hand (which is still very disappointing)

oh my god how-old bot is a riot
@heychado ;_;
maybe they'll do Chibi-Robo first to test the waters.. I'd buy it again
@heychado oh god please
@Jacobbles In retrospect idk what I was thinking. At least the time I said Shulk's Smash trailer wouldnt be in JP-only Direct was reasonable
@Jacobbles Nah the wrongest thing I've ever tweeted is probably the time I said Zelda U wouldn't get delayed.
and Golden Sun 4. And Isaac in Smash.
I can't wait for 2 Metroid games to be revealed at E3.
@Veedramon ow the online
@ChristineMCVA I really enjoyed it! But some aspects of it felt confusing, rushed or out of place.
@maidotsuki you used to be able to..
@Isaac4Smash Aww thank you! :D Been wanting him for Smash since the Brawl days, I'll never give up!
I guess what I'm trying to say is: if Isaac was in Smash I'd be the happiest Smasher alive. #IsaacForSmash
@Jilvein of course
and I really like using characters no one else in my friend group is using bc it makes matches more fun for me.
For me the hardest thing about picking a main in Smash is all the charas I wanna use most are being used by my friends :')
Regardless of whether it's fair or not I never see tiers like that being taken.
Something I've noticed about Kickstarters: if you charge ~$5000 for a "meet us" tier and say "travel not included" people will lose interest
Oh yeah if Ryu can get into Smash Bros then Bayonetta can too.

So push out Ryu and put in Bayonetta instead pls.

@NintenRob I don't think there's gonna be another M&amp;S game either tbh
@NintenRob true maybe thinking is bad for them, but at the same time Sonic deserves even better than Colours and Generations.
@NintenRob Yeah it's gonna be a spinoffy kind of year for Pokémon.

As for SEGA.. they need to step back and think hard.
@NintenRob SEGA aren't attending E315 and Pokémon has never been announced at E3 as it's a west-focused event, I doubt they'll start now.
@wpstart yeah, the more they do it the more frustrating it is that they never follow up :c
@wpstart Yeah ORAS needs a cheap DLC/Expansion of some kind, but I don't think GameFreak are nice/smart enough to do that.
Educated guess since mainseries Sonic and Pokémon games are pretty much never announced later than May.
Oh yeah since it's May, if we don't get a Sonic or Pokémon announcement in this month then they're not getting mainseries games this year.
"Stretch Goal £5mil: We will handmake our own amiibos and walk around the UK putting them on shop shelves without permission"

whoa
let's do it
@27CansOfTuna Rare the company belongs to MS yeah, but a bunch of the key staff left Rare and started a new company called Playtonic.
@27CansOfTuna Spyro the Dragon is great but Banjo-Kazooie is greater.
@27CansOfTuna Spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, a 3D platformer made by the kings of 3D platforming.
If you say "Royal Baby" 10 times fast you end up thinking "why did I do that". Try it! It works every time.
@alternisdim "how dare you play a video game to laugh and have fun... what is wrong with you"
some ppl don't know how to have fun ):

Nowadays I can't imagine hating the DK Rap it's just too much fun.
Apparently the DK Rap is included on a lot of "worst video game moment" lists bc people thought it was sposed to be taken seriously.

lol
Does GK Rap stand for "Grant Kirkhope Rap"? @grantkirkhope @PlaytonicGames
At this rate the GK Rap stretch goal will be /easily/ reached #YookaLaylee
@Wil348 MN9, which I don't blame you for blotting from your mind.
@Wil348 I'm not sure if Namco are taking IP rights for that
"GK Rap"

HE HAS NO SUBTLETY
@Wil348 One was listed by a retailer last month but Yacht Club made a statement saying it wasn't real.
NEW STRETCH GOALS HYPE
.@PlaytonicGames HYYYYPE
@centaurqueen Haribo WOULD be that gross
@Wil348 Shovel Knight isn't getting a physical version (yet)
@centaurqueen I wondered if it was supposed to look like the female symbol but it doesn't really
@Tracker_TD I'm super hype for Shantae too ^^
@centaurqueen wtf
@Wil348 I'm just worried if they did this it'd get some corrupt Publisher who'd find a way to take control away from Playtonic D:
This is like the fastest gaming Kickstarter of all time right? £1mil in 21 hours. #YookaLaylee
OH MY GOD THEY DID IT!!
#YOOKALAYLEE ALREADY REACHED £1MIL AND ALL STRETCH GOALS.
@Dejimon11 I hope so..
£10k to go..!!
Only £15k until #YookaLaylee has hit £1mil and all stretch goals :') daamn.

Oh yeah obligatory hashtags uh let's see here

#SCSURVEY #SOULCALIBUR

there I did it
Come and vote for my picture # 

^this was automatic idk what it does.. bloody technowizards!!
I voted for Hwang simply bc I was really good with him and he hasn't been in a game since SC1.
@SvendJoscelyne yeah May could really do with more bank holidays. Maybe just make the whole month a bank holiday C:
I haven't enjoyed Soulcalibur in a long time but it used to be so good, so I'm willing to take part.

PS. PLS VOTE HWANG.

@centaurqueen I think Puddy is a bit of a one off since most cats I know always hate their paws being touched including my other cat ToT
@centaurqueen Puddy actually doesn't mind sometimes she's let me do it a lot the last couple weeks.. but other times she's like "how dare u"
@centaurqueen i wanna poke the paws
@centaurqueen ahh ok!
@bookofdiamonds she's a magician
Puddy looking big. 
@centaurqueen I don't know what it looks like either so part of me hopes they keep it classic looking just bc it's Archie's own style now.
@centaurqueen the chances of finding many more recent back issues? nada. ):
@centaurqueen yeah from my experience in London comic shops they're often like that.. really random old-as-heck issues but-
@centaurqueen and yea Archie has had a really old style for a long time so I wondered if the lack of modernity was intentional at this point
@centaurqueen it's ok dang twitter limit! my comic shop will prolly be really small too so I'll have to see.
*looks at top trend* ok *stretches fingers* time to make a cool contemporary joke

is a royal baby born wearing a crown haha

follow for mor
@centaurqueen it's getting a reboot? o: is this bc of that time he got killed by a Predator or something.
@centaurqueen Yeah I might consider Spidergwen if there's a really early issue available at the comic shop when it opens
one line of the DK Rap applies to Puddy pretty well

"She can shrink in size, to suit her mood"
@hyapporankan same :')) tbh if cats fully understood human language they would be so judgemental of how ppl speak to them. Babies.
@centaurqueen which Archie comics do you like usually? It's so weird that they've just recently been upping their video game content so much
@centaurqueen it's the intimidation of the sheer amount of marvel comics that makes it really hard for me to approach them tbh
@hyapporankan Puddy's name used to be Spludge but we gave her so many nicknames that we just totally forgot what we originally called her-
@centaurqueen I had a subscription for Sonic and Sonic Universe (surprise surprise) and was considering a Mega Man sub too but nop.
@hyapporankan old cats that are tiny are a mystery
my cat Puddy's been sitting on my all the time lately too :')
@centaurqueen bc they assume I'm not going to pick them up ):
@centaurqueen yeah :'l but London is 6 hours away and I only get to go once a year so they stack up like 24 comics for me and toss em out-
@centaurqueen I'll probably go with some friends as a defence mechanism hopefully I'll b ok.
@centaurqueen man that's weird.. I can't imagine Cornwall being too cliquey w people like that but ya never know.
@centaurqueen they always cancel my subscriptions because I don't go there often enough :')
@centaurqueen my closest forbidden planet is like 4 hours away by car ToT
I usually go to the one in London when I get to go there but..
@centaurqueen Supposedly one is opening in the near city in a few weeks which sounds too good to be true! I hope they don't close right away
So many of my biggest issues with the modern game industry would be solved if publishers didn't feel the need to make EVERYTHING "AAA" lol.
If Banjo-Threeie never happened bc MS didn't consider it to be financially feasible, maybe they should have had a small team on it instead.
my fav part of the MCV #YookaLaylee interview. I wish more devs could see the value in smaller budgets/smaller teams 
@hyapporankan AWWWWWWW
@centaurqueen I've always wanted to find some but there are no comic shops near me in Cornwall ToT I'm glad you found some!
Sure it may not have the budget of a first party game but #YookaLaylee is the fastest game to ever hit $1mil on Kickstarter. That's demand.
If #YookaLaylee added more stretch goals I'd be totally down for an amiibo stretch goal B) #dreams
@Emi1yRogers ok.. THIS is mindblowing D:
Glad to see GoFundMe has some humanity :l
#YookaLaylee is already 2 thirds of the way to £1mil!!
@lilanimekitty Siliconera mobile is reaaaally awful
What's with all these Avengers ROB jokes
@VESPlQUEN this so hard :'l
Smashified senpai noticed me..
@VESPlQUEN yea exactly!
@VESPlQUEN yeah it's not lookin gr8 which is a shame bc I really want Square to keep making more lower-budget games like they used to x-x
@VESPlQUEN I think it still has a chance of happening depending on if second has longlasting sales but it's a bit worrying ):
@joelsei maybe if we keep playing it'll destroy fps and remasters

Grant Kirkhope confirmed for E3 busking
@sunnyemmerich I heard people have disliked it but I don't actually know anyone who disliked it nor have I seen why ppl dislike it..
@sunnyemmerich I knew I wasn't nuts to have liked it a lot it was a lot of fun
&gt;&gt;
why. fucking why.

what the hell is wrong with people!?
@hatsunemeeks 
@Emi1yRogers easily the one I'm most excited for, I'm so happy ^^
@NintenRob #But #The #More #Hashtags #We #Use #The #More #Companies #Might #Think #We #Are #Cool #Too #:')
HELL YEA THE MOST IMPORTANT STRETCH GOAL WAS JUST ACHIEVED B) I'm so excited! #YookaLaylee 
that is the most hashtags I have ever used in a single tweet. It's all downhill from here.
.@smashified Unsurprisingly I'd love to see #YookaLaylee get #smashified sometime! But I'd still love to see Isaac first ;D #IsaacForSmash
@Shringan182 yeah same ;-; I may not be able to til Sunday..
in lighter news only £10k til the best stretch goal is reached
&gt;tfw 64-bit version of the game is gone

why this... oh well ;_;
@Corneria 
@Davyb0t dats a good film
HALF OF £1MIL ALREADY #YookaLaylee bloody breathtaking
May 1st will be remembered as the day many old Rare employees had the best day ever and they deserve it.
@Corneria oh my god cheese land is pure dread and apocalypse in 200cc
THAT GRANT KIRKHOPE VIDEO IS SO GOOD OMG
@Corneria I had to choose a totally new build to the one I normally use and even then it's still hard

also brake often
thank u so much grant

@Corneria BE SAFE OUT THERE SOLDIER
@Dejimon11 Skyward Sword may not have been a great Zelda game but it was still a better game than what 90% of the industry puts out
@SirCroftScion exactly! this is precisely why a lot of backers feel betrayed by Comcept, esp since the actual game looks rly barebones.
@Dejimon11 I allow myself to get excited for Nintendo games bc they don't let me down.
@Dejimon11 same, well I backed it so I'm already getting a code for the game haha.
@SirCroftScion nah not for other ventures, just merchandising the hell out of MN9. Comics, cartoons, crossover games, etc.
@Dejimon11 yeah they counted their chickens before the eggs had even been laid let alone hatched

@SirCroftScion launched another kickstarter, focused on merchandising and generally been very opaque
(not fully since the game and its goals are obviously still coming out but I don't think MN9 is what fans backed anymore)
I feel like Mighty No 9 is a good example of a Kickstarter that kinda betrayed the backers' trust.
@maidotsuki 

#YookaLaylee #SmashBallot #SmashBros #amiibo 
poor grant :')
HAHAHA OH MY GOD WELL THEN
@joelsei yeah definitely at this rate
@SirCroftScion that's the dream )':
Only 35 left of the 64-bit edition.

Dammit I don't have enough time to think about how willing I am to pay £340 for that :'l
@Veedramon secretly hopes Jontron was one of them
I don't think they'll hit £1mil by midnight tho unfortunately :'L since they're probably going off UK time. Only 4 hours til midnight.
OH MY GOD PLEASE @PlaytonicGames @grantkirkhope
@maidotsuki Loved it, fav running gag in MCU probably, it was just the kinda thing that was a bit funny the first time then hilarious later.
[captain america voice] sorry for all the bad language on twitter today
4 stretch goals reached already omggg *-*

@snowhaired GOT PLACES TO GO GOTTA FOOLLOW MY RAIINBOOOW
It looks so fun and satisfying to just roll around and it's gonna be so handy for getting around quicker I love it!
I love the roll in Yooka-Laylee.. old collectathons were missing a fun way to get around quickly and this solves that problem instantly.
Almost at the fourth stretch goal already bloody hell
lol
@heychado Yeah I'm getting increasingly sad about it ToT the Battletoads segment looks amazing.
@PlaytonicGames I'd understand if not but will you be showing footage of the 64-bit version before the Kickstarter ends? I need tempting.
"What more could you possibly want, bar an amiibo? (Oops, did we say that out loud…)" 

PFFT (yes actually)
@britishgaming @SvendJoscelyne inb4 internet warriors who didn't care about it before suddenly appear and say "Capcom caved to those SJWs!!"
@MarzyMarrs ouch... unless they can copypaste an automated list or something ;D
"let's resurrect the buddy-duo platformer!"

right in my kokoro
@maidotsuki agreed (though I was annoyed about it on DSi too just less)
I might forgive them if they released it on Wii U eShop aswell.
I bloody love these guys @PlaytonicGames 
@maidotsuki o yea that makes sense I remember you being inactive for a while
@maidotsuki since then I've just been praying they don't do it for any more games I hate when early adopters get screwed over
@maidotsuki I'm surprised you didn't know it already I ranted about it for a week straight when it was first revealed :'l
@maidotsuki what did they do this time
Devs: No, it's because you won't…
@Veedramon rip bearbird.. we will never forget you and your little siblings will carry your legacy forth
@Dejimon11 wtffff
HAHAHAHA SLAY GRANT
#YookaLaylee has made a third of £1million already. In like less than 3 hours I think??
@maidotsuki I look at mine.. it's great..
@riivalee I'm really stoked too! It feels like a bizarre kind of really happy dream, I'm gonna back it sometime this weekend for sure.
@heychado it's been way too long.. over like 15 years since the death of mascot platformers, it's really sad
@riivalee yeah not long now until the original goal has been doubled!!
@Dejimon11 yep.. but thinking about it too hard makes me a little sad
Kickstarter being fully funded. That's how you know these guys are total pros, their team dynamic helps them work at an amazing pace.
Seriously Yooka-Laylee already looks so solid and pretty after just 3 months of work and they pledged to finish it with or without the-
@C3Mush @MarzyMarrs that would be pretty interesting.. and also really expensive z-z
@Dejimon11 same *-*
@MarzyMarrs I'm guessing all it'd take would be a manufacturing partnership of some kind with Nintendo for it.
@Dejimon11 
A Yooka-Laylee amiibo would be so awesome and would help it sell better on Wii U @NintendoAmerica @NintendoEurope MAKE IT HAPPEN!
First stretch goal is already broken so we're getting bosses and boss music for every level! #YookaLaylee
@Veedramon your fanart got onto Nintendo Life! 
#YookaLaylee has raised over a quarter of £1mil already.
@C3Mush I can't decide.. I'll decide over the weekend
@JonTronShow GO FOR IT JON 

I'll consider backing the 64-bit version of Yooka-Laylee if we get like.. screenshots of it or something.
@kariyanine not to mention the promise of a new Banjo game would spread a lot of goodwill and positivity that they sometimes could do with.
@kariyanine True. But when it comes to "proving" that XBO has more variety/exclusives/whatnot than PS4 I'm surprised they haven't even tried
@kariyanine Might be time for MS to learn that not every game needs a huge budget and is still able to make many fans happy.
@maidotsuki I've never even heard of the first one
@Wil348 Agreed, but they'll probably try anyway.
Ashley's Feels 
everyone at Playtonic must be so happy what a feelgood day for platformer fans
@HartPest good point!
Looks like #YookaLaylee is 100% confirmed #HAPPENING now :D
@MarzyMarrs let's do it! :D
Goal achieved in like 39 minutes dear god.
@joelsei cries
@kariyanine in about half an hour S:
"Yes, we employ the man responsible for DK64's myriad of trinkets, but we've had a stern word."

HAHAHAHA
petition for PlaytonicGames to never get bought out by a creatively stifling publisher so we can enjoy their pure creativity forever.
@Veedramon this is a bizarre but really good dream aaaa
*half tempted to put Yooka-Laylee in the Smash Ballot bc it's not getting Banjo-Kazooie and this is the next best thing*
oh my god I'm so excited for Yooka-Laylee this is really happening :'ll
Yooka actually looks more feminine than Laylee so part of me thought they were both female at first but this is cool too.
#YookaLaylee confirmed for hitting all stretch goals pls
i'm sooo tempted by the 64 bit version but man that's like... £340.
I'll decide which option to back this weekend I think.
@farronhat MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

*looks at calendar*
hmmmm
it's reached £100k already... jesus
@farronhat slay B)
HAHAHAHA
Banjo-Kazooie deserve so much better than to be where they are right now.
The amazingly quickly rising Kickstarter for #YookaLaylee just proves that Microsoft are sitting on something so many people want.
@Meicrobe that's how you know a game has demand. Microsoft have no idea how much gold they're squatting on :/
I haven't even checked the Kickstarter page yet but I'm at least 90% certain I'm going to back it in some way #YookaLaylee
only two hours til we get to see the #YookaLaylee kickstarter *-*
@NintenRob but some things are so similar to B-K I can't help but worry
@NintenRob probably not, I'm sure they've been careful to avoid stepping on any trademarks or copyrights

I just hope they don't get legal action from Microsoft or anything..
I know they haven't been subtle about the Banjo-Kazooie inspirations but wow that logo and font. 
Trying to decide how much I'm willing to donate to #YookaLaylee before the Kickstarter is even up.
Sakurai is officially ageing backwards
lol so they basically removed the need to "unlock" 200cc right after releasing it.

Bloody weird.
#HowOldRobot 
@lesbearian and knowing this makes being scared of everything even more upsetting /_\
@joelsei pls

NO PURCH NEC
@Meicrobe The Order is like 5 hours long and is a glorified trailer for its sequel.. so it should probably be cheaper still.
@Wil348 ;_;7
@Wil348 Pac-Man's a lot rarer than I thought he'd be..
lmao that's how you know a "AAA" game is garbage
@GlitchDeity The dungeon puzzles in Golden Sun are the reason it deserves to be successful, they're so clever and fun I love it!
@RaqibMarvelous It's very boring. There's no reward in anything you do and everything is repetitive besides a couple of puzzles.
@Wil348 @GoNintendoTweet the sad thing is you're probably right, if Pachter says Wii U sales will raise they'll probably just drop instead.

@Veedramon awwww!!

@Veedramon it's a rly nice pic you deserve it!! :'))
@Veedramon YESSS CONGRATS!!
@Emi1yRogers As someone who still gets excited for 2D platformers I don't think it's fatigue bc it doesn't look great at all to me either.
@TommyNapolitano I liked Ep Delta but it didn't make up for the missing features. How hard can it be in 2014 to implement Gym rematches.
that means that ORAS is intentionally missing 10 year old features O:
@riivalee Agreed! Can't wait to see them get the kind of well deserved fame Shovel Knight has c:
@TommyNapolitano Me too!
I wonder if Yooka-Laylee will achieve "instant-icon" status like Shovel Knight did. They've got the attention, they just need the quality.
@riivalee yepperoni!
Paper Mario 64 is out in US this week.. I would say ya'll are lucky but I already finished it on Wii. Great game.
@NintendoAmerica the uh... Boomerang? Maybe?
#YOOKALAYLEE

I SEE THE PUN.. I GET IT
THERE THEY ARE

@Pokemon EGG SO HOT YOU FRY A LEG
same
could mozart still be alive though
@Davyb0t UK is getting a Splatoon Direct on 7th of May, no idea if any other regions are getting it yet
@xD1x this one just fixed the Mewtwo single-player glitches that caused data errors and online banning
@GlitchDeity YESSS! I'm always so happy to see Golden Sun get new fans, it really deserves it! :D
@SarahAnneWillia SO HYYYPE
@dancerbartz @joelsei and as soon as he left he had a great time telling ppl that it was a nightmare
@dancerbartz @joelsei he wasn't fired, he had a deal to do avengers 1/2 and shield and he's done w them now so he left
@maidotsuki same.. but it's not out in US til May 1st ):
Michelle: I love Japan PERIOD! 
Malia: Tea ceremonies!
Sasha: J-rock!
Biden out of nowhere wearing eyeli…
It's not even Whedon's fault I bet he'd love to have had Ultron acknowledge SHIELD's events if Marvel would let him.
Agents of SHIELD: *puts own cloak over a puddle 4 u* "pls notice me"
Avengers: "Wow whose cloak is this." *walks over it* "Convenient"
Agents of SHIELD is like that kid who does so much to make its parents (Avengers) proud and its parents still won't acknowledge it
Agents of SHIELD was good this week but it was also a glorified Ultron trailer and Ultron doesn't exactly reciprocate.
When Skye made the Sonic reference in the new SHIELD I screamed irl
Bomberman ;___;
@Jilvein man it's such a shame though /_\ the FF series has always had great female charas in the past too
If anyone ever wanted a reason I dislike FFXV's team, THAT is exactly it. How ridiculously embarrassing.
LRT: Oh my fucking god
someone please put Square-Enix out of their misery
And they allow focus on multiple important characters and how they've improved rather than just the strongest ones.
I've decided the thing I want to happen most in Dragon Ball Super is a proper World Tournament arc. Those are always the best.
My Dragon Ball Super hype is kinda unreasonable
Gintama is breathtaking
Youtube changed again?
@Davyb0t the Wii U version needs something like this /_\
@kujikawaii it'll be available on PC tho
@kujikawaii literally everything that was funded through the igg campaign is available for *free* I don't see the problem at all.
@kujikawaii otherwise there will never be more content or sequels made ever.
@kujikawaii to be fair all the DLC we funded is still being made available to everyone for free. they have to make money somehow.
.@NintendoEurope Thank you so much. Thank you.
@Jilvein spider-man was a pivotal character in the comic version of it tho
@Jilvein I know a few things about it but the MCU one will be different anyway bc secret identities aren't important in it.
the Lucas masterpiece "leak" is a very easy fake and the faker didn't even bother to change the "1992-1996" thing at the top.
@Tracker_TD "1992-1996" tho
@Davyb0t easy fake tbh. Top says "1992-1996" aswell which is surprisingly lazy of the faker.
@demonsvenom and me too about this thing also
@demonsvenom mee too /_\
@Jilvein *cricket noise*

YESS
@27CansOfTuna a lot with their movies
Also bc I'm still worried that Sony's creative control will ultimately be a bad thing.
Spider-Man is neat but I really wish that Thor 3/Black Panther/Captain Marvel weren't pushed back.
@PeteyPiranha77 @DuckyDragon @HowlingDoom @Pokemon that's the one thing that'd really bring ORAS up to expected standard in my opinion
@PeteyPiranha77 @DuckyDragon @HowlingDoom @Pokemon this is possibly the worst thing about ORAS to me. What a huge let down. :(
Man if I were a Fire Emblem fan I would be really upset about the way FE14's being handled I think.
@DuckyDragon @Pokemon Yeah another missing Emerald feature. At least with Leader rematches the E4-2 level jump wouldn't be so ridiculous.
@RaqibMarvelous Mega Man Zero was published by Capcom tho
@Dejimon11 I don't know if it's specifically Joss bc Joss isn't the first director to express frustration with production
Still at least the movies have yet to directly contradict AoS like they already have done with Incredible Hulk
Long story short sounds like Coulson will never come back to the movies and the Inhumans movie will probably pretend AoS never happened

I love it when voice actors notice me :')
@Davyb0t I'm so bloody excited *-*
@VoicesOfGaming_ The next logical step is to do fully skullfaced versions of the cutscenes!
Actually it's largely responsible for getting me more into movies in general and I still look forward to new entries
It's been like 7 years since MCU started and this franchise is still probably much more fun than it perhaps deserves to be
@Veedramon [and iOS] [and this toaster] [and xbox 360 next week]

@NintenRob Rainfall was actually after some of them had already been revealed for Europe I think
@NintenRob yeah Rainfall was the "pls release these 3 Wii JRPGs in the USA" movement
@NintenRob Nintendo's decision to localise Xenoblade was not influenced by Rainfall, it was to be released anyway, just very late.
@joelsei Smash is inaccurate anyway bc it's possible for Samus to lose which we all know is bs
&gt;when ppl say operation rainfall was a success

it wasn't tho
my favourite DC Comics character from Marvel :) #NationalSuperHeroDay 
@dancerbartz holy shit I wonder
@Corneria B    A S

@HowlingDoom @PeteyPiranha77 @Pokemon Yeah the modes in BW2 were a good start but they were unreasonably difficult to unlock!
@HowlingDoom @PeteyPiranha77 @Pokemon ORAS was made even easier than R/S ): I wouldn't have minded if they included difficulty modes too
@PeteyPiranha77 @HowlingDoom @Pokemon Yeah there was a lot of unnecessary easy-ing, unnecessary since we had the new Exp Share.
@HowlingDoom @Pokemon Yeah I am honestly getting kinda tired of the feature cutting in general ): *coughclothingboutiquescough*
@HowlingDoom @Pokemon no reason we couldn't have both, Emerald had both a Frontier and a traditional Battle Tower as part of it.
@PeteyPiranha77 @HowlingDoom @Pokemon Was always funny to me how they didn't fix Gen2's levelling but changed Gen3's when it didn't need it
@HowlingDoom @Pokemon Yeah which is why it really shouldn't have been hard to include Emerald's content in ORAS, no reason to not include it
@HowlingDoom @Pokemon Didn't stop HGSS from having everything Crystal had.
@centaurqueen oh I think you did! either way you can add me c:
OH MY GOD ED BALLS
@centaurqueen which profile? o:
@Veedramon B)
.@Pokemon usually in Emerald when you're the champion you're taken to the Battle Frontier so I'm not sure why it's not happening this time
Since there have been tons of games with female Super Saiyans lately it'd be awesome if one appeared in canon
@NintenRob they're behind dead island
&gt;deep silver publishing mn9

well, this is awful
&gt;now has a publisher

ayy 
@riivalee Apparently they're in the Frieza movie too.. needless to say I'm excited to see them again B)
@riivalee also Pilaf :'))
@riivalee as opposed to dbz which was more about endlessly training instead of weird new things happening to goku
@riivalee Yeah it's fun, new and it also simplifies the kinda overcomplicated need for ssj2 and 3, that new way of getting power is very db
@riivalee I really expected better from rocksteady
god that's an expensive season pass S:
thanks goku
@riivalee plus if you like it there's good value DLC and free updates that makes the already huge game even huger
@riivalee aa if you love dynasty warriors I think you'll really like it then! I've heard ppl saying that it's one of the better DW games
@riivalee I would yeah. It's not the.. deepest game, but it's still addictive and fun and got so much content it'll last you forever
What if Dragon Ball Super's animation is as bad as One Piece's has become :'( Toei don't care
@Jilvein yeah Sun Wukong
@kujikawaii omg yeah...

also Jaco feels like a shoo in
@Jilvein it all makes sense..
@kujikawaii Considering he's in both the canon movies i'd say his chances are good

LIFE IS GOOD. COME BACK TO US PILAF.
@Jilvein Yeah GT was decanon'd by Battle of Gods

also Toriyama didn't write it
Ed Dragon Balls #EdBallsDay
I've never been a HUGE fan of DBZ but Battle of Gods was so interesting and reminded me more of the old DB series so I have hope.
@Jilvein Goku will return to us
@Jilvein This cannot be happening
So lemme get this straight.
- Actual new Dragon Ball series airing in July
- Story by Akira Toriyama (canon)

WTF. NO FRICKING WAY.
@Jilvein This is frickin unbelievable
THIS IS UNREAL
@lominsa @hotyuris Have a lovely trip!!
@Jilvein I MISSED IT I WAS TOO BUSY WATCHING DBZ
WHAAAAAAAT
...WHAT?

Ed Balls

@SoulDrill yeah that's a good point, I hadn't considered that.
If it does count as one then that's one hell of a loophole.
@SoulDrill Not sure about RDJ but Chris Evans' contract was 6 films and he's already been in 4 or 5. Maybe Infinity War is the last one.
@bookofdiamonds At the very least it sounds like he'll be around longer than I expected O:
I thought his contract was over...

#EdBallsDay Ed Balls
@centaurqueen I only noticed in the first place by total accident, it felt like a huge coincidence to me
@centaurqueen oh my god politicians are unreal
@centaurqueen On this, the 4th year anniversary of "Ed Balls"!!
@centaurqueen Its icon would be the same icon as his right so just "ed balls" would be fine
..yeah I have no idea how to bot either
@centaurqueen oh my god that'd be amazing

Five Nights at Go To Bed-y's
AGAINST THE LAKERS!
WE CHOOSE TO SLAM!
BLOSSOM DUNK! 
What I wanna know is: Is Stephen Hawkking really king of the hawks?
@27CansOfTuna yeah just like the original books were
One Thousand and One Nights At Freddy's
Forty Days and Forty Nights at Freddy's
&gt;tfw yacht games uses the ps4 controller light better than any AAA developer has ever done
@MarzyMarrs I love her too &lt;3

only one thing left to do now 
@adadoji She goes through phases.. she is particularly sweet this week although she did swipe at me outta nowhere yesterday
@adadoji she's gotta be doing it on purpose it's the only explanation ToT
@Veedramon SHE'S SO FRIENDLY THIS WEEK it's unbelievable
Yes hello there cat 
Five Nights at 4ddy's: 4 Nights 4 Furious.
@photonblaze he never outright confirmed it was, people just assumed it was

 Fire Night Red Leaf at Green Freddies
@chammychaplets And a new entry in the series will be released every night for 55 nights
I mean.. the franchise's name.. Five...

There should be 5 games in total esp if they're going over 3 anyway.
Doing 4 Five Nights at Freddy's games instead of 5 seems like such a wasted opportunity
LRT: take with a huge grain of salt.
@InfernoOmni 
Thanks Goku
@kujikawaii @sunnyemmerich If anyone at Konami has a Shulk amiibo I'll take it off their hands and let them off their bank debts in exchange
@ruukutia 
@TommyNapolitano It's gonna be an interesting week..
Are Konami gonna talk about this at all or
wowww
All this Konami stuff makes today feel like the twilight zone
@joelsei yeah the beginning of the game is a bit weak in that department :/ maybe sharla shoulda come in earlier
Lol
@sunnyemmerich this is all so weird wtf
@joelsei B-BUT.. REYN... ;-;
I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

If this is legit then I guess Konami are gonna bow out of the games industry.
ugh..
@sunnyemmerich yeah it's starting to feel like they don't even want to be doing it :l
@sunnyemmerich yep exactly
So while to western fans it seems like Konami is dead, they won't die, they'll just stop being relevant to anyone outside Japan.
Konami has plenty more successful business pursuits in Japan that don't revolve around gaming at all.
If Konami sounds stupid it's probably because their upper management doesn't care enough about gaming to keep trying at it.
Sounds like Konami are giving up on the games industry and are gonna focus on their Japanese businesses. Pachinko, Yugioh, real-estate.
She pretty much lives on my lap nowadays. 
@Meicrobe Same I can't wait to see what people do with it or if you can make secret exits and stuff
@BandaiNamcoEU Project X Zone 2!! :D
Mario Maker looks like it has an amazing amount of depth. Much more than I expected.
@Stealth___ He probably was blown away by remembering how Mario World had much more depth in 1990 than NSMBW had in 2009.

£23 for Amiibo? Bloody ridiculous @shoptonet :S and to think I used to use your site for its good prices.
@geistbox Same..
So basically, Silent Hills, even if it is finished, will be nothing like Kojima and del Toro's conception of it. Just "another Silent Hill".
Is Tekken really only 20 years old? It feels older.
@bookofdiamonds She turned her little kitty body into pure jelly blob
You know! The important things! :)
