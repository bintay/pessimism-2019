@maya_pitta I think this could be such a good and positive thing to do starting on Twitter!!!
@jen_ayerza I actually think it's gold and white<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
guys let's start a trend! post a pic or tweet one thing you are most insecure about! you'll see ur not the only one!!!
@maya_pitta stretch marks... most people have them and I'm tired of them being photoshopped out of pictures...
when girls say theyre insecure about their bodies, it's bc they notice small things that no one else does. Exhibit A: 
can my stretch marks just like go away that would be cool thanks
@trutherbot @bWillly16 wow that guy is so lucky that it didn't end as bad as it could've!
that was some poetic shit right there
tbh I think the real point of this dress thing was to see that we should be patient &amp; understanding that people have different perspectives
damn what a nice lookin black and blue pizza 
I see white and gold but I'm literally diagnosed w depression so eff the people that say this is proven by scientists... that pisses me off
ima buy that dress and wear it to prom just to piss everyone off
has anyone seen black light shine on white clothes... that's what that dress looks like... but it's still white it just gives a bluish tint
rainbow... case closed... 
can Twitter just be turned off a while after this whole dress thing

"No this is Patrick"

"Is the dress white and gold"

"NO THIS IS PATRICK"
tbt w my girls<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ #blackandblue or #whiteandgold #youdecide 
this dress is about to cause the same amount of frustration as flappy bird

that dress things is literally like this box... u can switch which side is in front 
obviously if u make the picture darker it's gonna make the dress darker... if I made the picture lighter u'd see it be white and gold
I legit only see gold and white
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SEE BLACK AND BLUE.... MY RUBBER BAND IS BLACK... THE DRESS IS GOLD 
@RyanBodie @AnnaliseRod it's definitely white and gold I don't even see black and blue!!
