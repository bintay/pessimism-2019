"@scooterbraun: one direction is over @justinbieber" 
*sighs* 
@antropics wear*****
@antropics oh so you were contacts and I find your eyes your best feature well
@antropics when I followed you I thought you were some typical 18 year old lookin white boy and then you talked about glasses............

@pinkprintdeluxe her songs are alright
@pinkprintdeluxe selena gomez's discography x
and as you can see kids this is how to be a dumb ass 
"@MariahCarey: @ArianaGrande remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?"
@jasonsproblem this tea is cold and bitter
WYD... 
@arianasremix lets enjoy the tea party together 
@buteraholy @ArianaGrande @selenagomez OMG
after he wipes his tears and searches the web for comebacks 
Zayn knows how to serve tea at the right temperature. Can't say the same for Louis Tomlinson
@ibeendrakein I used to until I read her tweets
@ibeendrakein and she is so cringe worthy she doesn't deserve to be in their squad
@ibeendrakein she's so embarrassing lmfaoo
I am here for Zayn Malik, he already put an end to one direction and now he will terminate every male singers career!
@NaughtyBoyMusic Drag That Sewer Rat!
. 
Remember when you were 12 and thought you could sing ! Some people still do HA! 
Louis will say something embarrassing or he might not have a comeback at all either way he is still trash
"@tearsfaIling: @breakoutariana but b*tch you tweet unnecessary stuff on both accounts" tea
@tearsfaIling welcome &lt;3
@ibeendrakein maybe you should listen to her recent covers on THT!
@ibeendrakein I saw :(
Stefan &amp; Elena together will never be that hawt
I am so in love 
@bieberseazy maybe as friends
@bieberseazy I'm rooting for bamon now anyways since there's no delena or stelena without nina
@bieberseazy I prefer delena and I always have
RIP 
"@bieberseazy: I love stebola I love stebola I love stebola"
I'm ready to ship Bamon goodbye Delena.
and now that Nina is leaving I don't see much without Elena in the show unless the story revolves around Bamon (Damon &amp; Bonnie)
Honestly, TVD would be so much better if Katherine didn't go to hell she was an iconic character
Damon &amp; Elena all the way
stebola doesn't have the type of chemistry delena has 
@CyberBreakFree what.
@musicfacts_jb lmfao someone needed to tell you how tragic your account is with comebacks like "selenatoe", just deactivate.
if you're gonna run a fact account for your faves achievements you should keep selena out of your mouth 
is this a justin bieber fact account or a selena gomez drag account?? 
Me 
Tragic 
Kim Kardashian is not a musician she's a reality tv star and y'all are just reaching when you try to come for her
one isn't even a singer so your drag ain't valid, stop reaching 
read the replies as an iggy fan fights for her life! 
@arianaskendaIl but it's so nice
@Iovingthepain yess
@antropics tea!
Yasmine would be dragging Ariana back &amp; forth if her faves album didn't flop, so thank god it did
no, he's going to delete his tweets clean his tl on cpg and run back to antropics 
Ari would neva downgrade from relevant artists that want to work with her to sketchers 
when will Ciara :/ 
This is depressing, I'm going to buy 50 copies to help out 
Tuesday May 5. Stephy is still here w us when she said she would leave on Sunday. God loves us!
@normanispaynes @deIuxeariana but how does Ariana exaggerate her vocals, I lost more brain cells reading your tweet than watching 5H rattle
RIP the eyeconic illumigomez who could possibly have a criminal record and almost got arrested. Bye king 
@illumigomez goodbye :(
@buteroIogy omgggg
Queen Ariana Grande 

I didn't glue on my weave tight enough! 
TEA

when illumigomez talks about talent 
jessiesbae when she looks at sweet talker sales 
@illumigomez @jessiesbae 
LMFAO is this what Jessie J stans must do when their fave flops 
you should have bought 100k copies of sweet talker then 
Delusion 
@illumigomez your fanbase is called heartbeats? I thought you guys were jessienators xD
@jessiesbae @illumigomez you're the queen of Jessie J stans jessiesbae
@JustMeValen the real question is what isn't the problem with that
I am sorry king of Jessie J stans 
@antropics @JustMeValen lets werk out together ladies 
The twig bitch did too 
I'm insecure don't know what for I'm turning heads when I walk through the d-o-o-o-r 
no matter what rihanna wears she is still stunning and can pull off anything
Tea is boiling hot 
yet she did it better than you 
Fav for the White Holy Trinity 
she could cut down the cute girl image and try something different 
Rihanna is savage!
@JessieJ @ArianaGrande @NICKIMINAJ run ladies
If katy, gaga &amp; madusty pussy's collab is trash, bang bang is safe!
@illumigomez why are you saying bs on your @bestvocaIists's account.
Katy, Gaga &amp; Madonna are dropping their new single, Jessie, Ariana &amp; Nicki are no longer safe.
I love me enough for the both of us

OMG 
@stuckonsel cat had a less high pitched voice in vic- and she was prettier, sam &amp; cat messed it up :(
@stuckonsel it sucked so much, victorious was more mature and funnier and cat's voice got so annoying in that show and looked so bad

Karma is real pt 2 
Ariana can't be fat she is vegan!
selenators called demi fat and selena gained weight. beliebers called selena fat and justin gained weight. karma is real!
the real question is what happened to Justin.

@illumigomez #EducationForAll #BreakoutClass #Day1
@yoursrihanna why does camila have more than all of them when she is the least talented from the group
@arianasamethyst I can't wait.
why does Lauren have less solos than camila when she can outsing her any day 
@arianasamethyst how much are selena and demi worth cause I can see Ariana coming
ariana's networth ain't even that high yet so jessie j is not worth much 
do not discredit me for that masterpiece it was atop the charts during its time
I gave myself my biggest hit no I didn't need anyone's help those sales came without promo
Request One Last Time &gt;

Can't u feel my pain in heart? <BROKEN HEART> @zaynmalik #ZaynComeBack #ZaynMalik 
OMG

that girl in your icon follows you 
Daily reminder infinity did not peak in the top 30
LMLYD is so good I'm in tears
Cassie deserved grammys for Me &amp; U this song is excellent

don't do this again 
@antropics @buterarighteous "i want it to be true" bitch bye it wasn't true all along and I got so excited
Cassie's song Me &amp; U will always be one of my faves
@buterarighteous @antropics omg louis did you just make that up or has it been confirmed
Kylie Minogue has such nice songs
@antropics I wish it was the 4th single olt didn't deserve it
@antropics it's a single?
I know they the same person
catfish 
this is beyond embarrassing 
I burnt my tongue @musicnews_shade @musicnews_facts
#DailyUpdates

No tea, no shade.
I'M CRYIN 
LMFAOO 
@rihannasweeknd you better not be!
@rihannasweeknd tinashe got some good songs but Rihanna and Nicki will always remain unbothered by her..
"@rihannasweeknd: Tinashe is better than Rihanna and Nicki Minaj combined" delete this
dragging mariah into it wont change the fact you had the nerve to trash rihanna, beyonce and taylor when you stan 5H 
trashde??? what a week comeback I'm.. 
you stan fifth tragedy.. 
only Rih looked good 
Likkkkke what the fuck turn down the damn volume or put your headphones on
@adoredeluxes thankyou haha &amp; my name is sonia

no one wants to be a delusional 13 year old girl who doesn't know the difference between twerking and rattling 
Rex from victorious is me
Eminem. 
@deluxeashley thanks. I love your account too and do I really intimidate you lmfaoo
@deluxeashley which one is mine!
Oh 
OH MY GOD 
since when was not being interested in a guy considered as throwing shade? 
the double standards 
Oh my god 
"her cracky rasp is not to everyone's taste" LMAO
Ariana vocally slays! 
what was she on while getting dressed bruhh
looks like an 8 year old kid wrapped a gift 
@antropics 1d stans need to take a seat :((
At least little mix still has all members of their band
@scottsdylan how did you change your font
stop slut shaming the girl cause she doesn't find your idol attractive 
@gomezscontrol that album has been out for about 6 years yet ME outsold it in a matter of months and debuted w more too.
It outsold K&amp;T WW 
@antropics linkk
K&amp;T still didn't sell that much more than ME considering it's been out since 2009 and only sold 66k fw. 
My Everything has outsold Selena's discography and Problem outpeaked all her singles.
@deIuxeariana I wanna know who said it today
@deIuxeariana selkordei?
Blac Chyna gonna get her ass whooped by Kylie's body guards which she will hire when she turns 18! Money is everything
I see pussy 
The damn shade in the last sentence I can't breathe
the shade 
isn't floyd Miley Cyrus's dead dog
fav for Pretty Girls 
@stephygrande last time I checked all the fd movies are on netflix
@stephygrande final destination 5
Nicki looks so good, well as usual
Harry Styles is not that attractive at all directioners need a dose of reality
mess 
@vivagIams oh well hopefully this summer we have hilarious convos again
@vivagIams I'm doing fine, anyways why were you so inactive these past months
@vivagIams how are you
@vivagIams omg haven't talked to you since last year sometime
why y'all watching mayweather and pacquiao fight when tori and carly exist 
@vivagIams JASMINE OMG
I didn't know Ashley Benson did a photoshoot with 5 seconds of summer 
Preach! 
why would you even do this 
*sigh* 
either that or byhrb, both are way more single worthy than one last time
Why Try is so good.
here to prove Ariana Grande is the real vocalist of our generation. 
it's 2015. mariah's voice cracks every time she performs live! 
@ddlovatoarmy @buterasloths hopefully never. Don't want Ariana to turn into a constipated emo who screams every time she holds a note
this live performance was holy 
lets appreciate Ariana's vocal abilities because not many pop girls can do what she can 
@ibeendrakein sure

How can you come for Nicki when you stan Azealia and or Lil Kim.
Barbz attack this azealia banks stan! 
I don't see Nicki Minaj 
Ariana has 4 octaves and Demi has 3. Take a seat
diabetes doesn't even have any vocal control she can keep yelling into the mic. Ariana sounds effortlessly flawless
Ariana is a soprano but has 4 octaves and is an A list vocalist
all demi can do now is go up on stage and scream at the top of her lungs 
delete this 
When I see a cute boy outside whip it by Nicki starts playing in my head
well shit. at least Ariana can sell out arenas and that was ONE quiet concert you dumb fuck 
FAVE &gt;&gt;&gt; @scottsdylan
@deluxeversions cause he fat
obviously that account is a mutual an ex mutual or someone who just stalks me..tragic :/
well Ariana can still SING whereas your fave can't hold one note to save her life. 
Pacquiao 
I want beliebers ** ***.
@paolwesley over igloo maybe
even gwen stefani shits on that living trash can
britney is a pop legend but iggy is not an australian chanteuse
Ariana will gross + $2 billion so her dusty pussy betta watch out 
you're gonna hear me roaaaarr x 
2000 BC* 
This tea
I do not regret throwing shade at you

@tearsfaIling I CAN'T BREATHE I THOUGHT "800 FREE FOLLOW" WOULD HINT THEM I'M LYING
I WAS NOT BEING SERIOUS IF YOU BLOCKED HIM YOU'RE UGLY AS FUCK
I was NOT being serious unblock him please I love Will
report/block @tearsfaIling for 800 free follows fave when done
America is messed up good thing I live in USA
same RT @holyselgomez: I don't even live in America I live in Los Angeles
I wonder if Ariana knows how much he used to hate her
that fake ass bitch deleted his tweet we did it brothers and sisters!
either Louis types complete bullshit or google translate is bullshit.. 
@paolwesley VH1
Rihanna can sing. 
"pretty girls will block rihanna's next single" ATTACK HER
iggy azalea is trash. if you stan her I feel sorry for you
Huh.. 
I'm gonna listen to pretty girls I don't know what to expect
@bieberhadid omggg "fancy words"

We're all here for a Pitiana collab! 
Ariana &amp; Pitbull will work together and get that top 5!
@illumigomez how can you be sexier than someone when you aren't sexy at all
Ariana has godly legs whereas demi has saggy thighs 
I do not make spelling mistakes that's how we spell shit in Canada

"1d updates" 
Goodnight I love Ariana
say whatever you want but her body is beautiful 
Her singles won't peak higher than Ariana's from the MyEv era but they're so confident..
Lets hope these delusional retards quiet down after their faves album fails to outsell Ariana's latest as they claim
Beck from Victorious looked better before
Slay 
Nicki Minaj is the queen of hip hop music and Ariana Grande is the princess of pop music

FAV for Flop

FAV for Flop
Tove Lo has a beautiful voice
Fav for flop brothers and sisters 
"ariana stans always bring up ariana's sales when do we even talk about sales" because Ariana actually has sales
@yoursrihanna globaliana grande

This fall is going to be so big! @ArianaGrande @msleamichele @RobertsEmma @ScreamQueens
A3 
Justin is still worth $100M more than one direction 
Y'all can keeping coming at us with "ariana stans are so annoying" and "ariana hops on famous dick" but at least we stan talent
Oh my god. 
OLT still gets radio play I've heard it in the car multiple times
Y'all will create hype over any artist like lana del rey for layouts....
Beautiful 

Why is Ariana's hair so dry and dead.. :/ 
It'll put wrecking ball and the heart to shame
She can really show off her vocals in a powerful, soulful and lyrical masterpiece
I'm expecting a legendary bop &amp; a soulful ballad from moonlight @ArianaGrande
@ArianaGrande "moonlight" BITCH IF YOU ASLEEP FOR THIS COVER SHOOT
Ariana's third album is titled moonlight
I knew those breakup rumors were just to fuel some hype for research! I can breathe air again
I love Ariana
musicnews_shade ain't 100% reliable
Justin made 80M in 2014. 
I'm here for their first selfie after the breakup rumors
Seaniana is still alive
I do not promote online bullying so don't search up my old tweets if I say something nice
she looks so pretty 
@antropics what even is that
"the man bun is so sexy it hurts me" I can't read suddenly
. 
@holyselgomez @OfficialBBMAs thanks

she unblocked me lmao
this tea 
and Ariana's singles are certified MULTI platinum so stay crying
they actin' like they don't know I was talking about her albums, none which went platinum but congrats on her singles getting certified
demi's delusional stans give us a reason to compare sketchers and Ari but Ariana is constantly compared to legends.
maybe this was too much for Mariah stans to take in 
I hate my brothers wow
Break Free 2.0 
@britneyspears work with Nicki Minaj instead!
she still ain't got a platinum certification. 
what kind of a comeback is this? 
@gomezscontrol they're so embarrassing... oh my god
if this is your receipt.. 
and Ariana has multiple top 10 hits on BB all within one era. 
@gomezscontrol lets not forget she has yet to get that grammy nom she speaks of
how is she a threat when she doesn't even have at least ONE platinum album :/ 
Demon stans doing the utmost yet failing and it's constant
They're really reaching now and still so delusional. I'm not even going to say anything this time
I got something to look forward too(:
the teachers are gonna be there teaching as usual but no ones coming cause of the strike
I don't have to go to school at all next week and literally no ones going to. Slayy
@ArianaTodayNet omg

I used my selfies with my friend and it says she looks 44 lmfao
Diff selfies diff age
It says I look 22 omg

@gomezscontrol it's coming
when I was using my broke friends ipod this morning she saw oomf's nasty ass tweet and started laughing like there's no tomorrow.
Selena Gomez &amp; Justin Bieber look so 2012. Jelena is coming back brothers and sisters
@coldplaygrande yesssss king! &lt;3

women*
27% of woman from a selfie study said they delete selfies if they don't get enough likes...
I'm finna bandwagon CL too, stay pressed! 
I just wish my earphones were working
that strike next week might end everything
and many kids are sexually abused so being educated earlier can be v helpful but way too many people are against this idea
the internet exposes young children to A LOT and they easily get the wrong message so the sex education curriculum is important
Kathleen thought it through for the education of young children in Toronto
@ multipleomf 
@tearsfaIling lmaoo the girl in the middle tho
You don't have to be a boy to play the fucking game xD
I can't w these sexist boys on black ops 2
aids it is 
How is a "rt vs fav" tweet going to define who the better singer is
it doesn't really apply to me but I'm not going to school next week at all thanks to this protest &amp; strike!
Toronto school board has added the sex education curriculum to elementary school kids ages 6-7 &amp; next week is a protest against this idea
OMG
I successfully ditched detention yay
let me see you put your hearts up!
I love you Anna  
@justinbieber nice hair

I have never used a pale icon in my life
I'm unfriending her on facebook and deleting her off snapchat if she talks to my crush one more time
*plays jealous by nick jonas*
my friends talks to my crush all the damn time I'm sick of seeing them together
When you have exactly what I want :(
I hate jealousy that's why you a piece of shit

This pressed bitch 
@rihannasweeknd that's messed up. blanket and most of her friends are annoying and uneducated retards anyways, I'm not surprised

@cuntyphase happy birthday Bianca, I love you(:
Kylie comes from a famous family you expecting her to be average? 
@stuckonsel since nina's leaving there is no elena no delena no stelena I'm kinda ok with the thought of bamon happening now
@intactbieber copy paste the tweet link

@JustinEnchanted yet his "promo" is nothing when his own career is dead

@JustinEnchanted if he doesn't need her then for what reason did Scooter make him tour with Ariana?.
@abesuxx @@@@
Her tour is still doing very well you dumb fuck &amp; she doesn't need Justin. 
I can't believe I've sang in a talent show before I'm talentless and how can anyone stand listening to my voice
