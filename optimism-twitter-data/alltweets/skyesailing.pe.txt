@cakeintheTARDIS lads lads lads
you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible
Came here tonight because when you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody,
And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve
And I love that you are the last person that I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night
I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes
I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts
I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich
I love that you get cold when it's 71¬∞ out
@sorryimfather delicious

just stupid small things someone does that can give you endless amounts of happiness<RELIEVED FACE> Feeling happy and lucky
don't have to be a man to be a good leader

if a man doesn't know that feminism is about wanting the equality of genders then that's his own uneducated fault don't justify yourself
it's should be about your freedom how you don't need men's approval to do something you want to do like come on
how can you call yourself a feminist if your main concern is letting men know that you don't hate them
@Phinmeister seems to have a reputation of having cool shirts

@skyesailing 8 of those are just Sinatra
@skyesailing I counted as I went along and there are 78 records here
"You know what's a good idea? Organising all of your records at 23:30" nope 
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice, then kiss me once again
You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you, or just how empty they all seemed without you

@violenthinqs if u have a good memory then this is amazing and you'll get like A* but be careful not to pile too much in b/c ur fry ur brain
@violenthinqs bloody hell is this speaking or writing and how long do you have to remember it ?
@xJustNele Yes you are! English speakers aren't encouraged at all to learn a new language, we're the ignorant ones. Just keep trying!
@__spiders I have to admit I'm an xbox girl. Forgive me padre

@Lauren121198 he's climbing the ladder to stardom!
@gerardway how are you celebrating?
#InternationalWomensDay 
even tweets frm ppl that don't follow me ur great
I'm in ikea so I can't reply to all of your lovely messages<SLEEPY FACE> Y'all are the best and you're the change we need in the world <SPARKLING HEART>
@liamtrevatt sorry is that completely stepping over the line to favourite something I believe in fucking mental
@Ginger_Moriarty thank you so much! Men like you are helping change the world :-)
@Pipe_Down @liamtrevatt @Ginger_Moriarty 
@50sbabydoll love u <HEART WITH ARROW>
@Lauren121198 thanks!<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> I feel it's a little out of season though
I LOVE and RESPECT men so much that I want to be equal to them. I do not want to take over power, I want to have the same access to it.
@starlord_peter if everyone in history just sat back hoping one day we'll all be equal nothing would have ever been done
@starlord_peter ignoring the problem to making it 'truly' equal won't change laws and save lives
@starlord_peter we need a movement because we are oppressed and we need to raise awareness so more men don't say "but you are equal"
@starlord_peter my point is that by denying women a movement you're denying them their equality
feminazis unite xxxxx 
@starlord_peter just in the same way SOME Muslims are involved with ISIS but people generalise because Islam is /OPPRESSED/
@starlord_peter SOME women are extremist. You are referring to FEMEN not feminists
@starlord_peter it's a misogynist term to oppress even more women
@sparrowdust I'M SO SCARED THAT I MAY BE OPPRESSING MEN BECAUSE U KNOW NOT ALL MEN !!!!!!!!!
@PotatoesCharlie maybe we'd make more of an appearance if we were encouraged to do more 'masculine' things from birth
‚Äú@PotatoesCharlie: @skyesailing will you Mum be going to work tomorrow on a building site?‚Äù She's just as capable <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@starlord_peter a woman cannot celebrate being a woman without being compared to a leader who murdered 6 million Jews
@starlord_peter hahahahaha I'm sorry your argument just became completely invalid because you used the term feminazi
@__spiders I IMMEDIATELY REGRET THIS DECISION 
@__spiders these r me n my fav reaction 
@starlord_peter 
@__spiders is this you omg
@__spiders You are a blessing to this earth <SPARKLING HEART>
@starlord_peter Should I feel ashamed of educating myself before throwing opinions around?
POC need a month b/c they are oppressed. Women need a day b/c they are oppressed. Men need a day b/c they're scared of being oppressed.
@liamtrevatt must be hard, all that extra income, not being taught that your body should be covered in fear of rape 
@liamtrevatt oh my god are you serious hahaha you cannot oppress and oppressor
@starlord_peter the inequality is still there because the people who are smaller need more help to be equal to the tallest
@starlord_peter think of it like, 3 people of different heights. We give them all the equal sized step and ask them to stand on them
@starlord_peter equality like that only works if we all start at the same level
@ all men who are unhappy about women having one day dedicated to them 
HAHA of course men are upset that for once a day isn't all about their achievements. EVERY day is men's day.
confidence is a kind of fake it 'til you make or kind of thing stop being mean to people who love their body their hair their skin their smi
told mum it's #InternationalWomensDay and now dad has to do the ironing hahaha
@PhilisAmazing 
@PhilisAmazing propaganda is an effective way to get viewers on YouTube but idk I have trouble believing anything the say anymore
@PhilisAmazing but they do it because they know that it will get them views, money, subscribers. I feel nothing's genuine anymore
@PhilisAmazing homophobia is a HUGE issue on YouTube and a lot of them have friends who genuinely struggled to come out on YouTube
@PhilisAmazing also discussed that they use things like "I'm coming out!" to shock viewers into watching their content even though
@PhilisAmazing I once read an article referring to Zoe as that b/c she wrote little of her book and the underwriter was under appreciated
@PhilisAmazing rather than sitting back and letting it be because they're scared of how it will affect their image and income
@PhilisAmazing i think they owe it to us to address issues such as Jason and use their power to raise awareness of current, serious issues
@PhilisAmazing I used to hate 'gleam team money-making scheme' but I'm starting to believe it now
@PhilisAmazing I think it's becoming less about their viewers and more about themselves/the money. People didn't fall in love with arrogance
#InternationalWomensDay HAPPY WOMENS DAY YOU BEAUTIFUL GODDESSES
@BlueSkyBrBa thanks <RELIEVED FACE>

@oscillatemikely no I think it just blew up
@oscillatemikely well 1/2 of people are saying gold and white and we're trying to figure out how
@skyesailing therefore it had to be black and blue yes??
I see blue and black. when inverted I see two different dresses. team gold and white see the same dress when it's inverted.
@sherrypotterr in what light do I make black white
BUT WHY WOULD IT TAKE US UNTIL NOW FOR SOMEONE TO NOTICE THAT PEOPLE SEE COLOURS DIFFERENTLY ITNDOESNT WORK LIKENTHAT
