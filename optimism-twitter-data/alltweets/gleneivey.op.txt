Down time: 19 minutes. I *so* need to find an email app for my phone that will poll faster than every 15 minutes.....
Yay: It wasn't paranoia to set up full monitoring on my teeny-tiny web site. Boo: It's no longer safe to blindly run "apt-get upgrade".
Seriously, how does a language that uses white space as a block delimiter become this popular? #GlenInPythonLand
OSS tool isn't behaving, and doesn't log enough to know why. Diving in &amp; realize I don't know the language enough to add prints. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
5-line script does what I want, but no error handling. Use it? Add error handling myself? Install/config giant Do-Everything package?
Wait, was that actually *easy*? Thanks to @disqus, the @ecdex blog,

.@onealexharms  I just found this 
@onealexharms Because we all want to know what you think, and you're kind enough to do us the favor?
@onealexharms The year felt optimistic, implying the promise of a '17. But perfectly happy with shorter.
@onealexharms It's really good--a subset of her latest book, which I also highly recommend.
@onealexharms This was in the "pipe dream" category for me, but you're right--I shouldn't have self-edited.
@onealexharms quoting: You have to copy/paste the link to your tweet by hand, but then it renders right.
@onealexharms If I had three wishes for #JoyConf16, one of them would be for... 
"If you say 'Sure, no problem'...you've just burned a lot more cognitive resources." 
Too long since I visited @avdi's 
Stop using twitter? Great. 
That thing where you wake up to discover your ISP's spam filter has eaten half your email.... oh, technology, you're so cute.
I'm going to be in New Orleans in January! I bet you'd like to, too. 

Making Badass Developers - Kathy Sierra (Serious Pony) keynote 
D'oh! Nobody's committed to this repository but me, and I *still* managed to "break the build." Alas.
.@mikegehard One repo: Multiple increases friction of keeping whole team familiar with all code. Multiple can easily become (too) Many.

Third Monday working full-time on @ecdex. Two of six weeks to next self-set deadline are past, and I'm not sure how I'm doing.
Yes, this was a promoted tweet. But still it's a pretty amazing stat 
#talkpay exchange between @scanlime and @vectorpoem: 

California Bookstore Day and Free Comic Book Day (#FCBD)! I'm not going home until I've way too much to read.
Yup, it doesn't feel like a real web site until it has @newrelic turned on.

even in 2015, our airplanes have integer overflow bugs 
Before I left my last job (two weeks ago), I was making $155K/year plus stock perks. #TalkPay #MayDay (software eng, &gt;20 years, Ruby/Rails)
Yesterday I was doing budgeting, and learned exactly what I already knew: for a software company, everything is small compared to salaries.
So busy! No time for anything but work.... and the first showing of "Age of Ultron"
Ooops. Perhaps you wanted that Google search ad not to go to a 404 page? #sonothiringyou

As someone working to launch a (transparent) (Kickstarter'ed) startup, this is so inspiring &amp; encouraging 

UNLESS YOU’RE WRITING JAVASCRIPT IN WHICH CASE BOTH DAYS AND DECADES ARE NaN
Wow. Taking HTML apart using regular expressions. This afternoon feels like a 1990s flashback.

some highlights:

1,563: a number of items large enough to justify writing a screen-scraping script.
I knew @zapier was cool (we used them @pivotaltracker), but they've also published this amazing wisdom goldmine 
Why yes, I did just mis-type "apt-get" as "apt-git" #thedangersofdevops
Seriously? Atom, for programming, needs OpenGL/GLX? I'm thinking that's not the best dependency for a glorified text editor...
LXQT, which 
@underpope I'm thinking it will be blog-post worthy. I'll tweet a link once things are working and it's written.
Wow, it has been a *long* time since I've seen a raw X-Windows display (setting up VNC to an AWS instance) 
.@lisacrispin Yeah. My new org is going to be all distributed. And GH avatars work directly against something like 


I'm conflicted over profile pics in tools: yes, social links &amp; quick recognition, but don't they re-introduce implicit bias to interactions?
As a @pivotaltracker user, surprised to see this ad. All I can think is "Gah, so little information, so much avatar." 
Nothing but writing emails today up until lunch. Always interesting to see which non-coding things feel productive. Today: yes!
I know it's just spring, but this whole "sunshine in the morning" thing keeps making me think I've over-slept.
@adamgoucher Using @pivotaltracker's cross-project workspace? Shows you the backlogs side-by-side, but not integrated into one stream.
@openaccess_rr Hi. I think you probably wanted to follow this account rather than 'dotglen'.
Why thank you spam filter, the email I most wanted you to eat was the test message from the new email config. *runs away screaming*
DNS configuration changes, email setup: things that cause you to spend ages clicking "refresh"
Writing an email. Have to Google a fact. Oh, Earth Day. Hey, tweet about Earth Day. Great, done. Now, back to my email, and.... d'oh!
Just set up with @mail_gun. I'm now imagining all the site's email coming out of this 
Yeah, don't know where that MX record went, but we're sure not getting email without it.... (oh, propagation delay, *you're* my favorite)
OMG. So much to do. Must put more things on the end of the to-do list, and not so many on the front.
8:05am Pacific. Same bat time, entirely different bat channel.


"Gotchas From Two Years With #Node" 
Wow. Is it really too much to want all four? Why make things harder than they have to be? 
Anecdotal observation: there's a strong correlation between seniority of developer and unwillingness to accept a flakey tool chain. You too?
New storify about 
How do you know your software project is still "small?" You can git force-push to master without fearing the ceiling will fall on you.
@bourgtai "You want to leave? The door's that way."
@bourgtai Synergy!

I need a thing on my phone that goes off every 6 hours and says "It's been N days since you wrote a blog post," but only when N &gt; 2.

@Storifyhelp Almost all sorted, thanks. Things are working, only glitch left is it's retained the avatar from the wrong twitter account.
TIL that I completely broke my @Storify account by changing my twitter handle. Maybe I can set a passwd  by recovery? And change that name?
Wow. $411k in ARR and @TryGhost just made all of their revenue metrics completely public: 
TIL about the free/public SSL Server Test 
Oh, it's so green and shiny..... 
Let's see, where was I when I stopped last night....? Oh, right, trying to install this new SSL certificate. #HTTPSEverywhere
...then scanned for pronounceability, and Google to search for potential collisions &amp; prior use.
@bourgtai All the four-letter .com's are used up, but that's basically how I got 
"Blacklist" is so much less menacing when I'm coding than watching TV....
(a different) "12 passing, 1 failing", but again time to change contexts.
Ah... first new phone in 7 years (yes, really) just arrived. I know what I'm doing at lunch.... #SoAndroid #VerySamsung #Wow
"11 passing, 1 pending" Seems like an excellent moment to change tasks.
If you're writing a client for someone else's API, and you find yourself polling them for state every minute, maybe change to a webhook?
Serious organizational smell: when team retrospectives go from being energizing to dreaded chores that leave people exhausted.
(1) April Fool's fake tech news goes way back. (2) Yes, I had this magazine at the time. 
Funny. Not having transactional fixtures in the test framework sure does push me to write fewer "unit" tests with db dependencies....
Noticing: knowing what the right solution is, and knowing that I can't afford to implement it that way, can lead to an evening of surfing.
Coworker pointed me to the Google Developers "Web Fundamentals" materials 
Things I'm sorry I thought, let alone said: "So, instead of Monrovia, we need a timezone that isn't London but observes BST?"
London changed off of "British Summer Time" over the weekend, causing one of our unit tests to fail. Of course.
That moment when you get a big blob of code working ( \o/ ), then realize you need to build infrastructure to write your next test (*oof*).
Drove past a guitarist busking. Couldn't hear what he was playing, but now I've got the "Veronica Mars" theme for an #earworm.
You know what I'm not great at? CSS. (*Why* is that DIV a pixel low?)
Oh...... environment variables. Maybe we shouldn't be so dependent.....
But! But.....but? Last time I was in this code, everything was green. And now, the Gruntfile won't even load?
