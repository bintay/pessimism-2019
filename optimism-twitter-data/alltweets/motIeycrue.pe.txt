@EUSTASSKlD thats not how infusing works at all

@SAMGUTHRlE WILL DO  ill make them fight me
@asparaguspcy wait new york when what
@SAMGUTHRlE I WANT TO SUE
@SAMGUTHRlE same how are they gonna explain that  theyre probably just gonna skip that whole thing and stick her w ronan right away
@SAMGUTHRlE I WOULD PAY SO MUCH TO SEE THAT WHY CANT IT CATCH ON
@SAMGUTHRlE nope just "peter" for one movie without wanda  even if they have crystal in the inhumans movie they cant have luna ever now
@SAMGUTHRlE CAN THEY MAKE A MOVIE OF JUST. FLUFF   NO DEATH
@asparaguspcy i cant believe
@SAMGUTHRlE i dont think so bc ive never seen crystal but im not sure
@SAMGUTHRlE TRUE TRUE HOW ABOUT NO ONE DIES EVER   LET ALL OF THEM LIVE IN PEACE
@asparaguspcy i. used to have that shirt
@SAMGUTHRlE I FEEL THAT
@SAMGUTHRlE is it bad that i wouldve preferred clint dying instead of pietro  im glad there was more clint in this movie but still
@SAMGUTHRlE nah they were like "its sad but id rather it be him than like cap or nat" they were virtually unaffected
@SAMGUTHRlE UR FRIENDS ARE SO NICE

@SAMGUTHRlE OMG YES BUT THE REST IS A BLUR I DONT KNOW HOW IT ACTUALLY ENDED
@SAMGUTHRlE ME EITHER IT WAS SO CLOSE TO THE END i got so numb i probably wouldnt have noticed if bruce had died right after or something
@SAMGUTHRlE exactly like what was the point they couldve waited til later to do it make non-comic people get attached to him first
@SAMGUTHRlE couldnt he have chosen literally anyone else instead of bringing him in for one movie thats so rude
@SAMGUTHRlE YEA LIKE THATS SUCH A GOOD POWER TO HAVE THERE ARE NO DOWNSIDES AT ALL TO KEEPING HIM IN THE MCU I DONT UNDERSTAND
@SAMGUTHRlE why would they ever do that theres so much they could do w him
@SAMGUTHRlE i cant believe they killed my child   maybe theyre lying about him being really dead???

ITS ALEX VAN HALENS BIRTHDAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY
im going to cape breton saturday im so excited thats my home
it bothers me SO MUCH
how is life in prison any better than the death sentence? youll probably end up dying there. not much of a life
hes 80 now. and theyll probably never let him out, not even to die free
probably not a great example but charlie has spent less than 20 years of his life in freedom, and will probably die in prison
even life in prison like idk what else could be done but i hate what it currently is
especially places that still have capital punishment (not sure what places do if they do) "you took someones life so we're gonna take yours"
like. obviously punishment is necessary but our system for it is such a MESS
funny how the career i want is with the fbi but i hate the way criminals are prosecuted and punished

@bblakeaf oh definitely it just wasnt a good decision at all to kill him off so soon
@METALLICASTIEL me too im so distressed :-((( im gonna let myself think its foreshadowing so my heart doesnt explode
@bblakeaf right theres so much they could do with the twins. i would pay to see like 184 movies about them alone but no
if they had killed literally any other avenger     any of them
@bblakeaf im not. accepting that
@sevendeadlyexes true i take it back
u better be happy w ur fuckin families hawkeye &amp; random kid bc my precious son died for u
theyd better be lying to us IM NOT ACCEPTING THAT PIETRO CANT BE 100% DEAD
at least i still have wanda
WHY THE FUCK WOULD U DO THAT THOUGH WHY WOULD U INTRODUCE MY FAVORITE AVENGER FOR ONE MOVIE N FUCKING KILL HIM
but theres so much money to be made w another franchise involving pietro &amp; wanda you greedy heartless bastards
WHY WOULD THEY EVER DO THAT
@METALLICASTIEL bc they never actually called them quicksilver and the scarlet witch did they? theres too much they could do w them
@METALLICASTIEL her reaction was so horrific though im heartbroken   maybe theyll bring him back like they seem to do w everyone else though
@METALLICASTIEL it was &amp; it was so weird he totally abandoned wanda
@METALLICASTIEL oh man that was so bad i dont remember how the movie actually ended bc i went numb and zoned out
@sevendeadlyexes it'd better be im ready to fight someone my poor children deserved so much better

mcu nat: i'm Going to …
@METALLICASTIEL same aou's got me so dead my poor heart
@METALLICASTIEL thank you omg i love yours too   hes a beautiful man
did they even ever call him quicksilver in the movie. did they ever call wanda the scarlet witch
@sevendeadlyexes if they dont bring him back later like they did with pretty much everyone else i will SUE
witches arent really mythical though

i think that guy thinks im mad at j*ss for the natasha thing
@EUSTASSKlD HOW IS IT NOT ATTRACTIVE TO YOU ITS LITERALLY SO BEAUTIFUL
if they dont find some sort of loophole to fix what theyve done i swear to god
im still so mad pietro deserves better
@EUSTASSKlD BUT LIKE   HOW DOES IT NOT MAKE SENSE TO YOU
@EUSTASSKlD I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW U DONT UNDERSTAND
@HateFemBigots what does this even mean
@EUSTASSKlD ITS JUST. SO ATTRACTIVE
@EUSTASSKlD NO ITS HOT OK
@HateFemBigots what
is it weird that every time i see a baby i think "everyone in this room was that size once"
who could have the audacity to argue with an oppressed person about whether or not theyre oppressed
also   my phone deleted all my photos again before i could back it up
@EUSTASSKlD NO THEY ARENT THEYRE HOT
im surprised the next thing she said wasnt "use your mind control to keep others from oppressing you"
thats one of the dumbest things ive ever read no one chooses to be oppressed
@jeditrash OK TRUE

but its ok bc i love anthony hopkins so much that it eclipses the weird will graham
will is weird in red dragon though
i kid im never right
thats bc i AM always right 
and now im watching red dragon
why is this random person praying for me though i dont need your prayers thank you
wanda and pietro are my most prized children
i love anthony hopkins
quid pro quo. yes or no, clarice?
i guess im not so much disappointed as underwhelmed. or unimpressed.
i have a harley quinn dress and im wearing it tomorrow bc now i suddenly feel like i have to
I AM SERIOUSLY ONE GIANT AOU SPOILER THIS WEEK I HOPE YOUVE ALL SEEN IT IM TRYING TO STOP MYSELF BUT

i forgot about the vision thing

not feeling jareds joker either. im overall incredibly disappointed, harley quinn is my child

the first part sounds like jodi arias
@jeditrash no Why
TOO GOOD TOO DAMN GOOD
@jeditrash im. dead
"did it ask to be murdered" it didnt ask anything it cant even think yet
sure it has a heartbeat but when it has a heartbeat does it also have a mind? not yet so what are u trying to tell me
@nolanwhyte oh my god lmao that doesnt make any sense how can they think that
if someone calls me mayo thats just rude, but its not racist
im never going to experience racism ever in my life. EVER bc im white thats not possible
like... you cant be racist to whites.... why dont u get that
i hate arguing whats racist and whats prejudice with close-minded people
love me some hannibal lecter

Dear guy wearing jeans
While on a treadmill, friction
Will not be your friend
i love clarice starling
i am disgusted by her and she cant even answer me, looks like this "feminazi" bested you
like oh sorry i wasnt aware that someones taste in music decides how educated they are
why is it that when someone who runs a 1d fan account tries to make a point to someone their opinion is automatically invalidated?
equating someone fighting for womens rights to a nazi? wow, ur so hardcore
calling someone a feminazi is disgustingly offensive actually
because we're so likely to respect your opinions if you call us "feminazis" and "broads", bravo
Some hetero: but what if ur WRONG. ???..?? Check,mate...,..
love canada

More than Canada …
i am sick of everyones shit this week and its not even monday yet
that is me yes
i took a bunch of birthday candles from the kitchen and stuck em in bread to use for a table altar
THIS IS SERIOUSLY SO ME 
oh my god
they follow me because theyre praying for me
aight if thats what u wanna do
why are u following me 
is she seriously shaming women for getting pregnant..... when she just said it takes two...........
@mikeyvvay ya that u
im seriously so bothered that someone can actually think that way
this. makes no sense 
i have a homeroom teacher who thinks if a 12 year old girl is impregnated by her rapist she should keep the baby.
i go to a christian school man i listen to pro-life arguments all damn DAY
@luhanphiIia yes
look at that, i used a joke in my argument. am i as sassy as you now?
she must hate me lmao
@MagicallySassy @mikeyvvay what, your opinion that heartbeat = human life
this girl. literally has no solid arguments
@jeditrash oh my GOD
why do people continue to make the "abortion is murder" argument
@jeditrash damn u caught me
god if youre gonna try to defend your belief at least have a logical defense that doesnt involve making jabs
@MagicallySassy @mikeyvvay not getting you very far
@MagicallySassy @mikeyvvay im just making a point. you really should learn to make an argument that doesnt involve sarcasm because its
does she think saying sarcastic things with an emoji at the end makes her sassy
THE FUCKIGN D SWAN
i also live to think im wittier than i really am
apparently i live to pick fights
@MagicallySassy @mikeyvvay by that logic cats and dogs are also people
abortion is not murder unless its after a certain point or its one of those birth-it-then-inject-it situations
i get what ur saying but someone choosing to have an abortion and ted bundy choosing to murder all those women are very different things
first of all most murders are choices that the murderer made
just saw someones anti-abortion argument was "it shouldnt be someones 'choice' to commit murder" um
i have a problem
i also dont like margot robbie to begin with honestly so
it looks like theyre taking some creative liberties with her costume maybe too many
harley looks horrible 
there is no one that they could cast as harley quinn that i would be happy with but they couldve done better
100% me 
@luhanphiIia plus i think i mightve shrunk it a little
god bless anthony hopkins
im going to watch. all of the hannibal movies right now

@luhanphiIia thank u
@luhanphiIia thats fine ive watched some pretty cheesy kdramas  theyre always cute damn
@luhanphiIia i dont even remember when i started watching anime   nah i think i was just early bc a lot more people seem to like it now
i will literally give u $10 if i dont still know all the words to shock by beast
i feel like an addict thats relapsing right now
"and hello is-" "annyeonghaseyo, i know" "wow really" "and with the gi its goodbye" "how do you know that"
theres a guy at yg that went to korea and he was telling us words and it went like this
i tried to learn korean and everything   i still dont get hangul but i can say words
@luhanphiIia i haVENT   oh no

he was apparently so tired n so desperate to get home that he nearly killed us both but now hes sitting on the couch watching tv w lights on
i was in a decent mood today but hes being a total ass and now i feel like shit
i wish id stayed at moms like he wanted
he completely ignored me because he "wanted to get home" like dude youre gonna die and we're never gonna get home
i told him to stop speeding because it freaks me out and its really dangerous and he didnt listen to me like at all
it was always a 50-80 zone, a super twisty road at 10pm, and he never went below 110 km/hr. the fastest was 140
i dug my nails into my leg so hard i have lil bruises
i literally thought we were going to hit something and die i swear to god
dad was speeding so much on the way home that as soon as we got home i hid in the bathroom and cried
the killer in this episode is honey bunny from pulp fiction OH MY GOD

dont need the negativity of a bunch of assholes who wont consider a different opinion :-))))
done with them, bye weepy babies!!!! blocked!!!!
@bocadgileto im not the actual band if thats what youre thinking hahah
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams sick of trying to get through to bitches that wont listen so yea bye fucker
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams i see that /youre/ stupid unwilling to consider anothers opinion and im
well fuck 
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams did i not just say i have nothing more to say to you
im done with that lmao
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams say to you. recognize your privilege and do something about the problem bye
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams if you cant get such a simple concept into your head then i have nothing more to
@JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch the best part is that i literally cant be racist towards whites not only bc its impossible, but bc im also white
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams that is literally what ive been saying
@AlexBilliams @WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch thats pretty much true
@AlexBilliams @WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes that would just be being an ass
@WilliamShoffner @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams its racism if youre in a position of privilege to oppress them for it
dont say hannibal lecter

im saying hannibal lecter
@JuicyJTrobes @WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams exactly. it would be prejudiced, but not oppressive so not racist
@C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes @AlexBilliams ive never experienced racism. i never will. im white. doesnt happen
@WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @AlexBilliams @JuicyJTrobes well they arent calling him mayo are they? not making fun of him for being white
@AlexBilliams @C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes let me give all your 'tactics' a try then. do blacks mean nothing to you, cutie pie? lmao :-((
@C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes @AlexBilliams racism has
@C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes @AlexBilliams again, dont have tumblr. tumblr hasnt given me shit. the word of people who actually experience
@C2theMitch @AlexBilliams @JuicyJTrobes then the racism is directed toward the "part asian" traits. not white.
@AlexBilliams @C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes i did google it. google's dictionary is not god. reverse racism isnt a thing. next
@C2theMitch @AlexBilliams @JuicyJTrobes give me one instance where you have experienced racism. one.
@WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @alexisxisabel repeatedly getting involved in foreign affairs that dont really concern them and starting wars
im gonna lose my mind lmao these guys are worse than the idiots in my class
@AlexBilliams @JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch they cant
@WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @alexisxisabel i dont have a tumblr account anymore so
@AlexBilliams @C2theMitch @alexisxisabel forgive me for not opening the icon im not particularily concerned with who your friends are
@C2theMitch @JuicyJTrobes textbooks produced in america by white people usually like to highlight only the suffering of whites
@JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch dont tell me to shut up if youre going to come into my mentions without me first addressing you asshole
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel im not saying they never have but it is not a mass occurence
@WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @alexisxisabel do u not pay attention to anything the u.s government does
@JuicyJTrobes @C2theMitch great. did an entire country participate in the mass slavery of white people? doubt it
@AlexBilliams @C2theMitch @alexisxisabel but im not talking about brown people right now, so ?????
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel thats unlikely
love all these weepy white boys in my mentions getting their feelings hurt because i disagree with their opinions
@C2theMitch @AlexBilliams @alexisxisabel having a black friend doesnt give his opinions on them automatic validity lmao
@C2theMitch youre so welcome
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel thats not what im saying. but a black man killing a white man isnt a hate crime jesus christ
@C2theMitch @WilliamShoffner @alexisxisabel not government power. because it is not an english place. we still come in there and kill them
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel its probably one black person killing a white person for every 5 black people a white man has killed maybe more
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel a white man killing a black man is usually a hate crime. black man killing a white man is probably, then, defense
@WilliamShoffner @C2theMitch @alexisxisabel you went to the middle east because you own the place? i have news for you

War happens when BOTH sides are armed. Not when one side is the police and the …
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel so yea, like the middle east.
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel think that they /might/ be a threat to the USA or because theyre just plain racist and oppressive.
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel how whites come in there like they fucking own the place and kill people that are different from them bc they
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel the middle east is not primarily populated by whites so that is not relevant to the argument. what is, though, is
- 1. They do weird shit.
- 2. They resemble mayo.
- 3. They have racist ideals.
im getting the vibe that this guy was called a mayo once and now feels that reverse racism is real bc his feelings were hurt
@alexisxisabel 
i cant help but get a little mean
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel damn. didnt know i was talking to an uneducated moron- oh wait.
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel whites as a whole have pretty much always been in power. so no, not ever.
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel no its not. oppression has to be involved for it to be racism. no oppression towards whites at all, ever
@jeditrash HANN QH
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel whites cant experience racism. prejudice, yes, and we can have our feelings hurt. but not racism. end of story.
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel i think you missed the part where it says "belief that ones own race is superior". superiority =/= equality.
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel no its not. denying someone their rights and oppressing them because of their race is racism, 'cutie pie'.

i cant believe he just said that oh my god lmao how can u think that
@EUSTASSKlD ohhh ok ya
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel oh.... my god..... are you? "racism" towards whites is just prejudice, we're not being oppressed........
@EUSTASSKlD i didnt know i had one
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel are you seriously insinuating that reverse racism is real
"not every white person does that" son i know, im white
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel im not saying every single white person im saying white people as a whole
White ppl: yesterday I got called a cheese cracker you don't …
but we should just ignore the 13-18 year olds …
me: how?
white people: 
@alexisxisabel im white and i agree 100% with literally everything youve said
@C2theMitch @alexisxisabel not being better than whites, just to cease being put down and mistreated by whites

u cant compare 5sos to any old punk or rock bands like fuck that theyre a whole different thing
no thought no emotion no anything worth anything in the lyrics to slsp

5sos has not put forth the work, the effort, the emotion, or the overall quality of music to be anywhere near nirvana

@nolanwhyte do you think i could get away with skipping headgear if the outfit was recognizable enough?
@nolanwhyte im pretty decent at sewing even though its super time consuming since i dont have a machine hahah
i have about 2000 backup plans but im thinking ill make my loki cosplay n leave the horns for last n then decide whether or not i need them
@nolanwhyte ohh ok yea

@nolanwhyte hairs probably /too/ short but thank u

"if I'm not aloud to wear what i wanted to wear today then I'm not going to be happy until i forget aboat it."
i found a note that i wrote to my dad when i was little that says:
@OneTonTurtle that video really means nothing to me as he is a homophobic sexist islamophobic who makes light of rape but good try
@OneTonTurtle the fuck did that come from that is not in the least bit true
@OneTonTurtle and thats a problem
this feels awfully familiar reminds me of my teacher
@OneTonTurtle @AdoreDelano but not everyone is and people still assume
@OneTonTurtle @AdoreDelano please tell me you dont just assume people are straight without knowing them bc thats how youve been taught
@OneTonTurtle @AdoreDelano you can tell me homosexuality is being shoved in your face when its seen as the 'default sexuality'
@OneTonTurtle @AdoreDelano if anything heterosexuality is forced down peoples throats more than homosexuality
@OneTonTurtle @AdoreDelano if youre talking about gay marriage ceremonies, no one thats uncomfortable with them is forced to attend them?
@OneTonTurtle @AdoreDelano not putting religious people in a closet. religion is a personal thing that shouldnt be shoved down ones throat
@MattMcGorry bennett is a beautiful man
“@memearchive:

theres no canadian flag emoji  ok
@jarodzsz ur so young
the show is talkin bout how all the stuff moses did to free the slaves from egypt was probably done with the help of aliens
well as ready as someone who is not involved in either religion can be
im also now ready to differentiate between sikhism and islam if he lumps them together
@iwatobios isnt it life crushing
i am 100% prepared to have a full on debate battle with sir over the origins of easter and debunk his lies about paganism
