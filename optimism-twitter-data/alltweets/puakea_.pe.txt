I miss my mom.
But almost is never enough
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
We can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
Sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
Truth is everyone knows
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right, but that's a lie, that's a lie
