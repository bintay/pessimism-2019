@kels80 I'm being a lady <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
20 days. Yup. 20 of them!!! Bournemouth baby to see that bloke sing some songs and shake his hand! <VICTORY HAND><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><FEARFUL FACE>
@CharleeDrew @alfredodapotato can't believe that was a year ago!!
Yippee!! The wedding of the year is here!! Absolutely can't wait to see one of my closest friends tie the knot later!
I really hope so!! 
@kels80 the answer is: quite a lot!
@CLSeago36 just bored of election gumpf!

Today, I am going to see how many carrier bags I have inside the big carrier bag in the kitchen. More interesting than the news.
@Canny_Kev I say just let them have it. Stop the buggers moaning!
@kels80 @_CharlyParker guess what turned up today?!!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@film_james91 going to bed soon because I'm between night shifts!
@film_james91 you too James x
@JezTaylorGuitar Gone in 60 Seconds is alright.
@JezTaylorGuitar that might be because it's the same bloke!
@JezTaylorGuitar sounds crap. You need Con Air for some good old fashioned cheesy vomity Cage!
@JezTaylorGuitar what film?!
@ClaireW_80 they grow up far too quickly!! Had a full conversation with mine yesterday. She's 2 and a half! <FEARFUL FACE>
@ClaireW_80 ahhh! I don't have to deal with that because she goes at random times!
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> whyyyyy am I at wooooorkkkkk <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #needalotterywin
@ClaireW_80 I'm a nursery mum <CRYING FACE>

@film_james91 this will be my third time in 18 months. Not quite as hardcore as some of my friends but not bad going!
@film_james91 ahhh I got my follow last year too. Nearly had a heart attack <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@film_james91 30th in Bournemouth!
Driving to my night shift and casually remembering I'm meeting @JamesArthur23 in 24 days!! Holy s**t!! <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@_CharlyParker yeah me too. That's odd! I'm sure they'll email I  the next couple of days x
Whatever your views on @KTHopkins, you must admire her love for her babies &amp; acceptance that they may be happier in a same sex relationship.
@_CharlyParker who did you book with?!
@_CharlyParker looking forward to it! Tickets should be here any day! Eeeeeeeekkkkkk xx
Happy Birthday to the gorgeous @_CharlyParker! Love you girly <BIRTHDAY CAKE><PARTY POPPER><WRAPPED PRESENT><TWO HEARTS> x
#ELECTION2015 
@LJay815 I feel like, if I didn't know you, I wouldn't know it was back on. We're about to lose Lewlew for a few weeks...
@xtlhx yeah a friend just told me. Must be an old petition but still worth signing!
@70sJan it's disgusting!!! I feel physically sick! How can anyone think this is ok??
@kels80 thanks hun x
@rickygervais @judythevet @pupaid please can you sign and retweet and help stop this barbaric behaviour <CRYING FACE> 
Please please can i call on all my twitter followers to sign and retweet this to others. Sick!! <CRYING FACE> 
@kels80 more than likely. Just don't k ow if there's anything to fight for right now.
@kels80 I usually do but I don't know if I should in this situation.
I hate life's awkward forks in the road. Do you fight for what you believe in or walk away because you fear it's a hopeless case? #hurtyhead
@andybrill89 too late if he's not really <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@andybrill89 and even if you didn't...After 5 you'd be able to feel it!!
@andybrill89 HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?!!!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kels80 it's pretty awesome. The rest are rage fuelled and not suitable for the Internet <POUTING FACE>
@RobertDowneyJr Internet says 'no'! You've broken the Internet!
@andybrill89 no lol!! Not going to do that! What the hell have I heard about a surprise nephew?!!
Discombobulated #WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough
@andybrill89 I couldn't <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@KTHopkins the heart attack is strong with this one...
"Your tickets have been dispatched"!
@andybrill89 thanks hun. After tonight...who knows! x
@andybrill89 I couldn't do that. Just drink more and pass out. You know the score
@andybrill89 and smash the place up <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@andybrill89 you know I can't drink that shite!
@andybrill89 that could work. Then smack the shit out of some golf balls and drink wine
@andybrill89 no I need to hide first then make a fort!! Too sad to make a fort right now.

@andybrill89 just been made to feel utterly god awful and shit tonight. Going to hide under my duvet and cry
Jesus Christ! I swear I've never felt so worthless than right this second!!!! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Exhausted!! Lovely day at the beach but time to head home and get an early night in!
@kels80 I know but you must stop. We've had this chat before.
Urgh! Buggering hell! I am on the verge of declaring I have man flu! Sexy phone pervert voice has turned into squeaky twatbag voice. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@kels80 awwww thanks! Knew you loved my prawn! #prawnlove
@kels80 but Tom Hanks in the video makes it epic!
@kels80 no. I'm going to charge by the hour for this thrill!
Got a cold. Voice is shot to bits. Could currently be a full on phone pervert!
@JesssseJ85 @kels80 "free parmo if you flick my prawn" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@susanlogan63 @MrLeeBrennan absolutely! And they did it with far more class!!
@markplayford <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@kels80 @CLSeago36 @_CharlyParker @JamesArthur23 @JesssseJ85 <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> love you too!
@kels80 @CLSeago36 @_CharlyParker @JamesArthur23 @JesssseJ85 Just to lighten the mood after all the yuk! Xx 
@KathrinaPerry @MrLeeBrennan you can have mine if you like <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@KathrinaPerry @MrLeeBrennan they left it out if the small print along with *warning: don't have children...ever*
@susanlogan63 @MrLeeBrennan keep up the good work Susan! None of these young'uns are even close to our expert level!
@KathrinaPerry @MrLeeBrennan <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm concerned about my dodgy hip. It's touch and go whether or not I'll come out of it in one piece!
@MrLeeBrennan I'm still #Bodyshakin at 32 years old! Think it becomes more of a health and safety risk though after you turn 30!
@CLSeago36 been Internet dating wifey? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CLSeago36 think we should!! <GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@CLSeago36 that's reassuring <FEARFUL FACE><FEARFUL FACE>
@CLSeago36 it's a scary ass world, believe me! They all do the "I'm nice" thing and they're mostly mental!

@MarkReadMusic absolutely loved it. Going to see it again I hope! Love that they keep the humour going through all the films.
@DJGroomie yup
Going mad with my 'report' button today. Some people shouldn't be given a keyboard or access to the Internet! #keyboardwarriors
@JezTaylorGuitar don't be telling me to do work Jezabel! You're not the boss of me! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JezTaylorGuitar it's true!
Why is everyone wetting their pants about a fight between a woman beater and a homophobe?
@kels80 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kels80 reported also. There's another one after this which I've also reported.
At work with a pile of stuff to do and my head is like "nah girl. Don't do it. I'm gonna make you feel horrendous". <PERSEVERING FACE>
@JesssseJ85 hopefully next time!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@JesssseJ85 @JamesArthur23 ahhh I would but I have to work loads in May <PERSEVERING FACE>
@JesssseJ85 @JamesArthur23 you should come to Bournemouth too!
@Canny_Kev or watch them all!!! Loved Age of Ultron
@JezTaylorGuitar working. FML
@JesssseJ85 @JamesArthur23 or we could just do an all nighter. I'm sure we could throw in some karaoke to give James a rest!
@LentesyMan @kels80 @xLove_Sarahx please please stop! Can't we all just be here to support James? This is madness and it needs to stop.
@JesssseJ85 @JamesArthur23 50!
@kels80 Emergency <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
About to drive through Watford to get to work while they're having their promotion party. 
4 weeks today and I'll be driving to Bournemouth for what I hope will be an exciting day meeting @JamesArthur23 and not complete carnage!
@kels80 reported <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
It's a Princess!!!! <PRINCESS>
So sad to hear about Rio Ferdinands wife Rebecca. A young mother, her whole life ahead of her, taken by an evil disease. RIP sweetheart x
@CharleeDrew I'll be working hard and hiding from all the fight hype (I am watching the news for the birth but she'll be hours yet - yawn)
@70sJan blatantly! If it's a boy: Roger Malcolm
@70sJan mine is Whitney Consuella
@70sJan so fed up of all the miserable sods moaning about it. It's lovely! A new baby is always exciting, regardless of who it is!
@KTHopkins Tyler or Chantelle Cambridge suit you Katie? Can you imagine? Prince Tyler of Cambridge <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Canny_Kev that possibly sucks even more than actually having to work!
@70sJan yes! So exciting! I think she'll have a girl!

Love my friends! @kels80 is being a pervert, @_CharlyParker is oblivious to weirdos and @chrissylou79 needs this big smooch <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> #LOVE
@_CharlyParker yes it would be awesome!
@_CharlyParker Hahaha! No I was being genuine! Iceland I think. You can watch the Northern Lights from your bed!
@_CharlyParker can't remember now! Would need to look it up!
@_CharlyParker that was me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@_CharlyParker I was going to go here at the beginning of the year but the plans fell through!
Wouldn't be a Friday night without some drama llama kicking up a stink on twitter! 
@Canny_Kev hmmm...I'll let you off then! Just don't do it again! <WINKING FACE>
Another weekend of night shifts. How have I managed to end up with so many?! I'd complain but I'm the div that does the rota! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@kels80 EXACTLY!
@kels80 men like that need to deal with their issues before they ask someone on a date!! Wastes my time off!
@kels80 last one spooked because I'm friends with my ex. Can you say "insecure"?! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kels80 yes. This is acceptable!
@_CharlyParker hahahaha! I'm not sure I want to ask!
Following a tragic 2 month run of dating total weirdos &amp; douchebags, I am imposing a 'no cupid' rule! 
@kels80 I could win £250 from that twat on TV!
@kels80 Hahaha! Not videos?
@_CharlyParker CATCH ME OR I'LL VOMIT ON YOU AT 1AM <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kels80 best way really!!
30 days until I meet this man! Is it acceptable for a 32 year old to faint?! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@kels80 sooooo cute! Then they turn into creatures of rage when they hit 2!
@kels80 that's making me broody. My uterus is scared beyond belief right now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JesssseJ85 never been more grateful to be a veterinary nurse! Humans are gross!! <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>

Meanwhile...on twitter <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@kels80 bet you're lying! You know...because you're a big boasty liar pants <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I've been away from twitter for 4 hours. In social media time, this is a week and I'm sure @kels80 has probably done something else wrong <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JezTaylorGuitar @chrissylou79 oh I wish I could but I can't! (I only need to bump one person. Not several!) <CRYING FACE>
Log on to twitter. Usual level of drama from grown adults! You need to remove yourself from my twitter if you're crazy. #thankyouplease
@chrissylou79 @JesssseJ85 @kels80 <CRYING FACE>
@kels80 thanks hun. Trying to but this one's a bit of a killer!
So I've basically had the weekend from hell! I'd like to be positive about the week ahead but I fear that's going to be even more shitty <CRYING FACE>
I need to go home and hide in my bed now.
Colder than a snowmans arse today <FEARFUL FACE>
@kels80 it's just jealousy. Tragic really! Sad little trolls!

@kels80 oh no! I couldn't do that!
@kels80 I might not come back from Bournemouth <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kels80 they smell too <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@kels80 I will don't worry!
@kels80 of course she does!! It lures so many into a false sense of security! Take your eyes off her for a second and you're devil meat!
@kels80 I did. Found them decapitated and with weird markings on them. Probably sacrificing them...<SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@kels80 she's worked out how to pick the lock...
Why did my daughter feel it was necessary to wake me up at 6.15am?! Why is that appropriate? How is it legal?! <SLEEPING FACE>

Very bumpy flight! Now safely tucked up in bed with a cuppa and a kit kat! Missing the bestie lots already but glad I'm home with my baby!
Sat at Edinburgh Airport waiting for @British_Airways flight 1459. Hope it's not a bumpy ride home <FEARFUL FACE>

Looking forward to getting home to my baby tonight!
The day I've been dreading is finally here! Heathrow bound later for @British_Airways flight 1462. #facethefearanddoitanyway <FEARFUL FACE>
@British_Airways see you tonight for a (hopefully) smooth flight to Edinburgh!
"@Selina_JAxx: <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>

@chrissylou79 you ok hun? <KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JesssseJ85 Me too and I've only just got out of bed <CONFUSED FACE>
@judythevet we have stacks of it! Bumped up the order last week! Just waiting for other clinics to call us wanting to steal it!
@judythevet only one chocolate tox so far this weekend! 6 eggs in 1 dog. I guess if you're going to do it, do it properly!
@kels80 the same or more I'd say. The only main difference in the milks is the fat content. Nothing else should change.
@kels80 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> go on then! My milk knowledge is limited but let's give it a shot!
@kels80 I didn't realise there were serious questions about milk?!
I'm going to hide in a cave. I am not built to deal with the current level of drama in my life! Men. They're like damn buses <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kels80 what the...
Obsessively cleaning the staff area in the clinic...and singing...and dancing! #easterduty
@British_Airways thank you Sam. Happy Easter to you!
@British_Airways they always do Sam! Unfortunately just a phobic flyer but I will persevere! I try only to fly BA because you're fab!
@kels80 @British_Airways rar! <FLEXED BICEPS>
Flying with @British_Airways to Edinburgh in 10 days. Blood pressure already up! Face the fear and do it anyway...and cry. I'll cry a lot! <FEARFUL FACE>
@kels80 Hahaha! Yeah I feel the same about flying to Edinburgh next week <FEARFUL FACE>
@kels80 not 100% yet. Just waiting for Chrissy to get through her icky couple of weeks.
@kels80 got a job to do, do it properly. That's my view!
@kels80 I was thinking more directly to the face?
@kels80 I already feel sick so more than likely I will actually vomit
@kels80 not at all. Probably delete them after half an hour. They'll just clog my phone.
@kels80 ok. I may not bother taking photos. What's the point?!
@kels80 if I hadn't bought the ticket already, I wouldn't. It's ok. I'll just get drunk beforehand. That'll make it more bearable
@kels80 yeah I seem to remember he has one or maybe two. Personally I think it'll be a total waste of life meeting him.
@kels80 well that's one from last year. I think that's him. Can't be 100% sure though. 
@kels80 he's ok I guess. I mean, I wouldn't kick him out of bed I suppose.
@kels80 Erm...well he's a "singer" apparently and plays guitar. Can't be very good. Not heard any of his music before.
Busy 2 months ahead! Edinburgh next week, wedding of one of my dearest friends, Take That...oh and I'm meeting some bloke called James too!
Really have dug myself into a bloody hole these last 3 months. Anyone want to throw me a ladder to climb out?!
Loving that Winnie The Pooh is trending only 3 places behind #leadersdebate. #PoohforPM
@gee_63 Please don't try getting into debates with strangers. My entire family is medical, as am I. We know what an emergency is. Goodbye.
@gee_63 and that is a decision to be taken by my GP. Not you. I am not abusing an emergency service for something I didn't see as being one.
@gee_63 yes but I'd rather that than just head to A&amp;E. Probably someone else with much greater need of them. Was only a broken arm after all
@chrissylou79 mmmmm...smog!
@KTHopkins @Louise_caitlinx went to my GP once when I'd quite clearly broken my arm because I didn't want to bother A&amp;E! Hate time wasters!
Poor dad is stuck getting home from work in the city. Someone decided to chuck themselves under a train. My curry is delayed as a result <POUTING FACE>

@kels80 I'll get something drawn up!
@kels80 "I <HEAVY BLACK HEART> Kel" t-shirts..."Kel Rocks My World" hoodies..."Kels No1 Fan" keyrings. I could help you design them!
@kels80 you should send signed photos!
@kels80 I saw <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@flightwit thank you for your views on the Germanwings crash. Flying in 3 weeks (ok, with BA) and even more nervous after the crash.
@stevebrookstein that's one word you could use. Seeing as it's before the watershed, I'll not share my names for him!
@stevebrookstein I've suffered depression. Didn't murder anyone though. Hope he burns in hell. No one can justify that kind of act!
Another spinal appointment today at the Royal Free #Ebolatastic
@stevebrookstein I don't even want to imagine what those poor people went through. Children and babies on board too. Just heartbreaking.
@stevebrookstein more interested in knowing about the pilot who tried to kick the door in and save them all. Don't even know his name.
@chrissylou79 Hahaha! I'm on duty all Weekend so could do Sunday or Monday morning?
@British_Airways always reassuring! Flying with you in 3 weeks to Edinburgh. Needless to say, bit twitchy already after this week's events.
@chrissylou79 whoop!!
@dawn_cooper5 @British_Airways be sure to mention it when you check in Dawn. They're always fantastic with me and deal with my crying well!

@JesssseJ85 It's ridiculous and so immature and...well...just totally insane!! What do they think? James will run off with them?! #asif
@JesssseJ85 well I'm not targeting anyone in particular so if someone has a go at me, they obviously feel they are one of the nutters!
@JezTaylorGuitar they obviously have really pointless lives to feel the need to behave that way! They need locking away in a padded room!
@JesssseJ85 I'd ignore them all day long! I'm just horrified that grown women are acting like completely obsessive, mental cases!
@JezTaylorGuitar totally agree! I'm shocked by their behaviour!! Fucking nutbags some of them! Obsessive doesn't cover it!
Why are some women being so crazy about this tour? Seriously!! You're grown women not 15 year olds! There will be no 'head kicking'! Freaks!

@Harrv_Styles idiot. Go open your eyes to the world. Most religions/races have extremists of some form. They do NOT represent the masses!
@traceycrowe77 Happy Birthday fellow January baby x <BALLOON><BALLOON>x
@kels80 urgh! It's gross! <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Why is everyone wetting themselves about the CK poster with that nob on it?! Am I the only one who thinks he's repulsive?!

@Danniii_xxx I haven't stopped working at all! Lightweights!
Just introduced a friend in the USA to @JamesArthur23. She has sense. She feels the love...she's now scouring YouTube and educating herself!
@LJay815 I'm just going home zzzzz
@DJGroomie where the fuck were mine?!

One night left to get through! Then i can go crazy from lack of night time sleep (day time sleep is crap).

Is the Woman in Black sequel out yet? Has anyone seen it? Is it any good?! Loved the first one.
@kels80 I am! But I'm also on a nicotine deficient spazzer!!
Bed. Sleep. Work again tonight. Already had my first grumpy cow fit of the day! Why o why did I start smoking all those years ago?!!
3am. Day 2/day 3. Could kill someone for a ciggie. #kickthehabit #nosmoking
Don't get me wrong, I'm pleased all the animals of north London are healthy but...yawwwwwn! Makes for one hell of a boring night!
@JamesArthur23 hotel california!!
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 jumped up flapping about like a twat and squeaking. My vet must have thought I was having a stroke.
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 the power to make a (nearly) 32 year old vet nurse wet herself in the middle of a night shift?! Hahaha!!
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 2 bloody years I've been waiting for that!! It can be my birthday present!!
Off to make a brew to calm down. Excessively fangirling right now! @kels80 you are a babe. @JamesArthur23 you have made an old girl happy!
@kels80 totally! Need a change of pants!
@kels80 about time!!! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>

@_CharlyParker totally!! Going out is insane and totally over rated!
Looking forward to Jools Holland later...if I'm not asleep by midnight, which is highly likely! <SLEEPING FACE>

@DJGroomie best tweet of the night <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@chrissylou79 well...there you go! Everyone needs an Aries in their bed then?! <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Quite looking forward to my 32nd! Certainly looking promising! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
Think 2014 can finish now. The last month of it has been very hard and upsetting. 2015 already looks more promising!
@BimSusy i would. Best to get it checked x
@BimSusy lots of reasons! I have them because I have a dodgy electrical impulse in mine and anxiety!
@LJay815 Stay classy Hemel...
Loved the Christmas episode of #DowntonAbbey! Brought a tear to the eye more than once!

In 48 hours, I will be watching @DowntonAbbey with a nice glass of wine!! Yay!!!
@JamesArthur23 Oi Mr Arthur! What's a girl got to do to get a follow off you these days? Been waiting for long enough!

Really excited about this weekend! Going to be so much fun!! Very much needed and deserved...even if I do say so myself!
What an amazing hashtag. Well done Australia for coming together in horrible times. Thoughts and prayers with those involved #illridewithyou
It's going to be a mad week next week! No rest for the wicked! Night shifts all over the place! #nochristmasforme
Think it's time to pull my head out of my arse and stop being a moody twit!

@chrissylou79 hope you're ok today honey xox
@DJGroomie I have sent you a few! And no. Not even close.
@DJGroomie fuck me! You are alive! Answer a text once in a while you antisocial mong!
@DJGroomie chill ya tits!
@DanMcCauley22 @chrissylou79 A question I ask myself on a regular basis. Although I'd use them to perv!
Life is tough. However, surely it's better to keep the things that are precious to us close rather than lose them forever. #drunkthought
@thedannie_b Congratulations!! I'm sure everything will be perfect this time xox
@JesssseJ85 She's so gross!
May have been naughty and bought all the Christmas specials of @DowntonAbbey so I can continue my way through the boxsets...
Overtime should be illegal...
@JezTaylorGuitar I've met him #uselessfact
Pay day tomorrow. I feel a change in the hair colour coming on!
@markplayford ahhhh crap! Forgot to put my profile back on private <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Can't open my bottle of Dr Pepper. Pretty much caps off the most shit week ever <CRYING FACE>

@_CharlyParker I'm down to about 2 hours now!
@_CharlyParker i have a 1mm fuse! <COLLISION SYMBOL><COLLISION SYMBOL>
@_CharlyParker everyTHING annoys me right now!
Genuinely feel like I've lost a part of me. It's horrible. Wish I could make it better.
@JesssseJ85 i completely agree. Life is too short and anything could change in a single moment. It should be embraced, not sacrificed.
@JesssseJ85 wish i could retweet this. So true
2am and I'd love a little nap but here I am, staring at the ceiling, crying my bloody eyes out STILL!! Grrrrr....
@chrissylou79 i won't do the same. I've been balling for about 4 hours now. Look like a total puffy eyed gonk!

Productive morning of ironing, emails and angry venting/swearing! Time to stop swearing and get little legs from nursery <TWO HEARTS>
@kels80 @BongoLegs yes! Gorgeousness!
@kels80 @BongoLegs looking forward to part 2. May cry though because it's the last one!
@BongoLegs have fun! It's pretty awesome!
Hunger Games was awesome! Shame my pain meds wore off half way through! #megaouchy
Off to see the Hunger Games tonight! So super excited! Very much needed after the super crapola week I've had!
@JamesArthur23 off to see hunger games too tonight. Yay!
@montyscar thank you <HEART DECORATION>
@montyscar that's good! I have the most foul taste in my mouth too. Hope it goes soon! I look like I've been punched I'm so swollen!!
@montyscar ouch!! it's my first time and i have antibiotics and nose spray too. Was wondering if there was more I could do to ease it. <CRYING FACE>
So I'm basically a walking medical nightmare. Lovely people of twitter, I ask you: Do you have any tips for easing the misery of sinusitis?
@xtlhx I'm so excited,  I may pee when I get to the cinema! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Sat waiting for the doctor and arguing with my 2 year old who is convinced she has 3 eyes. No but mummy appears to have 2 heads...<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Just seen a photo of myself from last week. Liposuction and a nose job please!!! #uglytroll
@chrissylou79 yeah...<CRYING FACE>
Band Aid 30...I'll just donate money. Please don't make me listen to that shit ever again!!
@kels80 Meh. Been better. Head up, push on!! That's my motto.
@JamesArthur23...needed a cheer up. Found it! Awesome! Thanks <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> James Arthur sings Nina Simone's Feeling Good - T…: 
@kels80 me too. Probably for different reasons but i do too!
Hahaha!!! @KTHopkins is making me laugh so hard, I may pee!! Makes "I'm a (Z list) celebrity" so much more entertaining!
Never give a 2 year old stickers! 
@ashleighjanee96 you can do night courses. They're not very expensive either and you can look into student loans to help.
@ashleighjanee96 it will if you want it to!
@ashleighjanee96 it can be rewarding putting them to sleep too. When they're suffering and in pain, it's nice that we can stop that.
@ashleighjanee96 it's hard work and can be quite tough on the emotions at times but it can be very rewarding too!
@ashleighjanee96 ahh give him a couple of weeks and he'll be better!
@ashleighjanee96 have you castrated him?
The more I think about yesterday, the more scary it seems. Life is precious. Make the most of it and embrace it before it's too late.
Feeling mostly like I've had a fight with a bus today. At least I can feel my legs again though. Huzzah!!
Oh for god sake! Is it national shitty week for everyone or just me?! <AMBULANCE><HOSPITAL><CRYING FACE>
@chrissylou79 they never are!! <CRYING CAT FACE>
About to do something drastic! Blonde, red or something else?! #timeforchange
@_CharlyParker thanks honey. I'll be fine as always <FLEXED BICEPS> x
So awake. Staring at the ceiling wondering what the f**k happened tonight. <CRYING FACE>

@BimSusy I've rehomed 2 in my time and rehomed 2 to friends. You learn to resist! Don't get huge numbers of strays in though at the moment!

Just eaten too much in Edinburgh with @swizzuk! He's feeding me bubbles...badness!
@easyJet massive thank you to your flight crew on the luton-edinburgh flight this morning! They were amazing helping this nervous flyer!
Airport Bus Wanker. Possibly the worst kind of bus wanker. What do you think @kels80?!
@kels80 Pretty lady x
Flying to Edinburgh in the morning! Best think about packing whilst drinking wine to calm the old nerves!
I almost feel ashamed that I'm sat here laughing at @KTHopkins tweets but the woman is bloody hysterical!
@kels80 Me!
@JezTaylorGuitar Morning Jezmundo!
@JezTaylorGuitar Holy shit! Your life is too hardcore for me!
@CharleeDrew Always hungry for pizza. Dominos?
@davec_uk I think that's a fair assumption!
@davec_uk I know what hench means but I'm at a loss with "bear tings"!
Honestly, what does "Bae" even mean? I realise I'm not down with the kids anymore but for christ sake! Stop making crappy words up!
@kels80 I DM'd you to check lol!!
@kels80 Well I thought it might be that thing but I wasn't sure...
@DJGroomie Yeah that'll do it! Although I expect that from you!
Everyone seems so happy in twitterland tonight! What's happening?!
*sings the song of a tired, crazy person*
@chrissylou79 @kels80 @BlondeCassie thanks hun x
@kels80 @chrissylou79 @BlondeCassie ok hun x
@kels80 @chrissylou79 @BlondeCassie Hahahaha! Sooooo annoying!! x
@kels80 @chrissylou79 @BlondeCassie I'll let Chrissy tell you! I need to get to work!! x
@chrissylou79 @kels80 @BlondeCassie Hahahaha!!! I don't mind, you know they'll agree!
@chrissylou79 @kels80 @BlondeCassie Haha! You including mine too.!
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 It's just not helpful! I didn't authorise it!
@JamesArthur23 I'll be in bed, between night shifts! Seriously Arthur, you need to ring my PA before you do this stuff ;-)
@chrissylou79 @kels80 This is why I bugger off twitter for days at a time! It's like a funny farm sometimes!
@chrissylou79 I've got one of those too. Really annoying!! Wonder if it's the same person?!
@JezTaylorGuitar Glad I'm a mingpot! I hate Pickled Onions!
Right then Monday, you horrible sod! Help me get this week out of the way! I need to be getting my arse on a plane to Scotland!
@DJGroomie You need to question it? Dominos FTW!
@chrissylou79 i got a retweet ages ago and had about 30 follower requests in 5 mins lol!!
@kels80 Hahaha...I don't see that one happening any time soon! x
@kels80 Unless I have more little legs lol!! I need a clone! x
@kels80 Totally! Love my job, wouldn't be going to Paris without it! Just very sleepy! x
@kels80 August! Got 10 days off and going to Paris for 4 of them on a champagne fuelled getaway! x
@kels80 I just need my holiday! Worked flat out since I came back from maternity and I'm knackered! x
@kels80 Oooo the list is long and exhausting! Need chocolate and my slippers ;-)
@JamesArthur23 You could be the first. Have faith. You're hardly a stereotypical XFactor winner. For starters...you're good! #oops
@thedannie_b @JamesArthur23 @julia_stoppel Oh my god! You're terrible! Hahahaha!!! xx
Tired and getting a little fed up with a few things! I am probably not the most approachable person tonight!
@kels80 Well I like to have options! x
@kels80 I have boot slippers and flip flop slippers, fuzzy backless slippers and a pair I can wear outside if it's dry!
@chrissylou79 Hahaha! We'll cope! Facebook is shit anyway these days. I only keep it because I have overseas family on it! x
@chrissylou79 I was at work so I don't count!! Plus I have you on here so I'm good! Lol x
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Oh I haven't got a clue either! I just wing it! Lmao!! x
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Hahaha! Oh no!! I'd share but I'm selfish!
Flying to Scotland next weekend and Paris in august! Not bad for someone who wants to die whenever they see a plane! #panic
@JezTaylorGuitar Did you post it and I just didn't see it?! ;-)
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 yes! Hahaha!! x
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 yeah I saw some of it, made me chuckle x
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 thanks hun x

@CharleeDrew Deep thinking for this time of night!
@phil500 I have said that to someone before. Don't think I was that polite though!
@kels80 Sounds like fun. Walk in naked with "fuck you" written on your arse tomorrow!
Monday morning blues has definitely hit this house! #unhappy :-(
@kels80 Naaa! Did that earlier!!
Need food. Waiting to go and get food. Man buggering about on laptop. Might just eat man (NOT in that way!!)...
@CharleeDrew Fantastic! x
Happy Birthday @AshworthShirls!! 21 again ;-) xx
@JezTaylorGuitar The fella and I have placed loads of bets to make it more fun!

@kels80 @JamesArthur23 I was very pregnant when I watched this XFactor!! It did nothing for my nerves/hormones!!
@JahmeneDouglas I'm at work until 8am!

Monday. I'd be more sad if I didn't have a fabulous weekend planned! Bring on the next 6 days!
@chrissylou79 @JamesArthur23 Glad to be of service! I too am a happy MILF lol!!!
@chrissylou79 @JamesArthur23 It was a good video! Really pleased I got it! Not for twitter though as some git will nick it!!

Wow some people need to stop being two faced! Don't say one thing to me then plaster something different on social media! Someone will see!!
@CharleeDrew You have self service rage! Count to 10 or just go in bareback on a horse. That seems to get the staffs attention!
@DJGroomie Happy Birthday bitchtits! x
@JezTaylorGuitar I'd pay to watch that!
@kels80 Still just your innocent spy! Hehehe!
@KTHopkins I'd rather be a snob than a benefit scrounging chav who has 4 children by 6 men #JeremyKyle...
@thedannie_b I have no idea how to add you! Where do I go?!
@thedannie_b Farm name is Posie Farm xx
@thedannie_b Hahahaha!! No they just sit there swaying or looking fat for days! xx
@thedannie_b Sodding addictive, life sucking game! I'm always on it!
"@MattTarrant: You know I dont pack until 5 seconds before I need to leave but I unpack like 5 months after I come back" Sounds familiar!!
I need a lottery win so I can give up work! My life is far too hectic!
@JezTaylorGuitar looking in the mirror Victor?!
@chrissylou79 Brains on toast?
@chrissylou79 Lots of fun. Best shave me legs! Lol!! Mwah x

@JezTaylorGuitar @kels80 Agnes is fab. You should be Victor!
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Indeedy! x
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar You take it for now. You're nearly due a change!
@JezTaylorGuitar @kels80 ooooo I like that!
@phil500 I'm a Vet Nurse. Spend my life saving animals and wanting to hurt people who abuse them!
@JezTaylorGuitar Hahaha! I'll be raiding the old biddy name dictionary later for more!
@kels80 Mavis will get me started!
@JezTaylorGuitar That's a boys name!
I feel I need to change my name and keep up with the current fashion! Suggestions welcome!
@JezTaylorGuitar Too deep. Going to eat cake...
@kels80 @MissyH34 Sounds like a very good plan!!
@karonlouise She's 17 months old and a total handful! Too much like her mother but she's only got me so it's to be expected lol!! x
@kels80 @MissyH34 Oh we need fleshy proof!

Bored. Boooored!!! Someone entertain me!
@kels80 Hahahaha! The rolls were hidden in the dress!

@kels80 Hahahaha!! Yes more than likely from what you've said and I've seen! x
@kels80 do I need to slaughter a goat in round 2 coz that might be awkward for me!
@kels80 should I unfollow or am I official spy?! lmao!!
@kels80 I liked Maureen! What about Doris?
@JezTaylorGuitar I'd quit my job and take it up as a full time hobby/public service!
@samwright2912 @LeannaWright94 Hahahaha!!! Man I've got a big gob!!
@kels80 @kimmy09 I will be! x
@kels80 @kimmy09 I'm not sure either! Check back later and I'll probably be rocking and dribbling in the corner! We're getting too old ;-) x
@kels80 @kimmy09 I took my profile lock off but I might put it back on now! I've just finished work and still knackered lol!! X
@kels80 @kimmy09 It's just disrespectful and trampy! Cheap bastards should buy a ticket to go and see him themselves and get their own pics!
@kels80 @kimmy09 Wow! Fucking bang out of order!!
@_CharlyParker love you too chick! xx
I want cake. I have no cake. Someone bring me cake! #thankyouplease

Too much to do today, no time to do it! @kels80 we need a plan, @_CharlyParker make sure you find us tomorrow!!
Watching Limitless. Surely this is a totally feasible drug to expect on the market at some point!!
@kels80 hahahaha!!
@kels80 You didn't tell him about the chloroform plan right?! Lol!! x
@kels80 Want to borrow mine?
@kels80 Shit! You're right. I'm getting some chocolate body paint too! Om nom nom!

@JezTaylorGuitar @kimmy09 I feel the same when I have a mouthful of nuts...
@kimmy09 @JezTaylorGuitar OMG! My eyes!! You dirty woman!
@JezTaylorGuitar Because it's all a cover up and they know what happened! That's my theory...
@JezTaylorGuitar @kels80 well you can sleep in one of the stables then you tart!
@JezTaylorGuitar @kels80 Just bunk in with Kel!
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Yay!!
@JezTaylorGuitar Well you never know! He might like a flutter on the horses then bugger off after!
@JezTaylorGuitar Hey bitchtits! Are you Newmarket bound on Saturday or no?
@JamesArthur23 When are you looking at releasing album 2?? x
Yay! Newmarket shopping day! Hopefully I'll find something and won't be naked!
@stevebrookstein still one of my all time favourite films!
@thedannie_b Gemma is the best name! If you shout it with something offensive next weekend, I'll answer! x
@kels80 Not long til the weekend chick!
@kels80 Think it's fair to say you're drunk...
@rainylewis08 I did that once, managed about an hour!
Have to be back at work in 2.5 hours so naturally my body won't let me sleep today!! Argh!!!
@Danniii_xxx because they don't bloody exist! Am mostly going to Newmarket naked!
#neverendingnightshift....
@kels80 I'll DM my number!
@kels80 Cool beans! We need to plot to make sure we find each other!
Ok ladies! What are you all wearing to Newmarket?
@LJay815 Don't be sad Lewlew! We have a pretty shiny in our cabinet now! #COYG
Flippin amazing weekend! What's next? Oh yes...Newmarket!!!
@kels80 Oh yes! Politics always need discussing!
Might throw up from excitement today!! 12 hours until I see the man for the first time in 3 weeks!!!
@JezTaylorGuitar I didn't give you permission to play at my house!
@JezTaylorGuitar Where in london?
@JesssseJ85 Good night! I'm off for my pre-shift nap!
@_CharlyParker And this is why you shouldn't take drugs kids!! Pmsl!!!
@JesssseJ85 standard for the news over here! Do something worthwhile &amp; it gets overlooked! Have your tits/arse fall out - front page!
@JezTaylorGuitar Does this include throwing shoes and screaming?
Stephen Sutton is fundraising for @teenagecancer on @JustGiving. Show your support 
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar yeah but not the big ones! I couldn't walk for a week last time!
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar I nearly did! Shame on me!! Who's bringing the butt plug?
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Sounds like fun! I'll grab the whips too!
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Ah yes. Need to make sure he doesn't shout for help! Hang on...is this an intervention or kinky kidnap?!
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar You get the beer, I'll grab the porn and the rope. That's right isn't it?!
@BongoLegs #bromance
@kels80 @JezTaylorGuitar Funny as fuck though! I think we need to stage an intervention...
@rainylewis08 @JamesArthur23 we'll miss you chick!
Anyone else think our dearest bearded grump, @JezTaylorGuitar, might have gone a bit mad?! Pmsl!!
@JezTaylorGuitar possibly the funniest follow I've had! Bravo! Don't work your kettle too hard!!
@kels80 I didn't notice if I'm honest. Only saw the England one...now seeing that there were loads...!
@JamesArthur23 @SmokeyArthur sounds like you need a vet nurse to help you...
Rest In Peace Stephen Sutton. An amazing young man. So brave and selfless. Heaven has gained the best angel xx
@kels80 why?!?!
Hahahahaha!!!!! Just seen my Instagram this morning! Thanks for the entertainment @JamesArthur23!
@rainylewis08 @ollyofficial I'm 31. Thirties are SO much better than your twenties!
@rainylewis08 No I meant my James has an A3 lol!!!! Oh the confusion!!
@rainylewis08 He has an A3. I want an R8. Meanwhile, in the real world....lol!!
@rainylewis08 This confused me briefly! My fella is called James and has a black Audi hahaha! #nobraintuesday
@WaylandClaire Give it a couple of days. They must have sent them in bulk so it's Royal Mail dependent now!!
YES!!!!! Look what the postie brought @kels80!!! 3 weeks! Horses and @JamesArthur23! Excited now!! 
@kels80 @kimmy09 @emmastuartxx Oh well! Next year maybe! x
@kels80 @kimmy09 @emmastuartxx Oooo bugger that's a long way! Possibly not going to happen with little legs to look after!
@LJay815 Childhood = destroyed if he's guilty!!
@kimmy09 @kels80 @emmastuartxx when? where? I really want to go toooooo!!
Final night shift. Bloody knackered and covered in dog slobber! Ohhh how i love my glamorous life (I really do!)! #vetnurseproblems
@JezTaylorGuitar Poof! Grow a pair of testiculars, brush your beard and get out there!
@LJay815 I don't want to scare the poor bugger! He does have to perform you know!
@LJay815 Exactly! Not getting into ANOTHER argument about old news and trying to cover my body for future events is more important!
@LJay815 NO! I'm trying to find a dress so I don't go naked!!
@LJay815 Shush lewlew! You know I'll start getting all gobby otherwise!
@LJay815 Oi! Nothing wrong with a bit of Jamesy!!
@LJay815 LEWIS!!! Oh my good god! Newmarket on the 31st May for some gambling and to see James Arthur!
Can't find an appropriate dress for Newmarket. Might just have to go naked at this rate!!
@JezTaylorGuitar it's because you're an old bugger!
@KTHopkins I've just offended my eyes by looking at that website. What a load of jumped up nonsense!
Happy Birthday to everyones favourite mad twitter biatch @kels80!! Have a cracker honey!! Happy Birthday to your prawn too!!
@LJay815 I have no idea what your on about. Go to sleeeep lewlew
Sing a happy song and count to 10 before I start having a rant...#nightshiftproblems
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 Really?! Don't remember seeing that bit?! I tweeted them anyway lol! #impatient
@kels80 @JamesArthur23 if we get our bloody tickets....grrrrr!!!!
@NewmarketRace @Charllouiseox @JamesArthur23 @TheJCLive When are you sending out tickets to those who have already bought them?!!
3 weeks til Newmarket ladies!!!
@Michlovesja @BongoLegs Hehe...he'll be swamped! There's going to be loads of us!
GP surgery rationale: let's give the walk-in an appointment with the doctor with most patients waiting! Cheers! Only been sat here 30 mins!!
@kels80 Me either! Let me know when yours arrive! I might email the place next week!
@kels80 Win!! Few clothes? Oh...your Newmarket tix arrived yet?!
@kels80 Hmmm...I don't think so because they're to assist the main present. When I saw JA in southend, I didn't count the travelling!!
@kels80 Hehehe!! Do gig tickets count as 2 presents though?!
@kels80 See! I'm useful lol! It's how I thought my 30's would be best handled!!
@kels80 One for each year you've been alive! Gotta make this growing older stuff worth it!
@kels80 That's your birthday pressie to you sorted!
@kels80 WHOOP WHOOP!!!! Well done!!!
@kels80 GO GO GO!!!!!!!!
@kels80 Shhhh woman! 30's are fricking awesome! Hated my 20's! Look at all the stuff you've done this year!
@kels80 Go on girl!! 1....
@kels80 2.....
I'm not sure what's happened to my brain recently! @KTHopkins has gone from 'bitch' to 'comedy gold' in my book!!
@JezTaylorGuitar I just have work all weekend. Bit shit really.
My wonderful child has driven me to the edge of insanity today!! I need a dark room and a straight jacket!
@JezTaylorGuitar Hmmm...close call. Think I'd take the tea too.
@JezTaylorGuitar Or go to the pub?
@rainylewis08 @JamesArthur23 Top right. Phwoaaar!!!
@stevebrookstein Agreed! No sympathy when she marries a guy after 8 weeks of knowing him...especially given the background of both of them!!
@kels80 ok hun. I'll dm you if I find out more x
@kels80 Ok hun. Very close to me! If I'm free, I'll pop down!
@kels80 When do you need it for?
@kels80 hang on...I'm doing some investigation work!
@kels80 There are a lot of hotels close to the stadium to have a look at. Try

@MadJaples Apologies!! I get aggravated when I think I'm being trolled!
@dez_ombie @KTHopkins I am trained in a specific area so I have had 4 in my life and moved through choice for career progression.
@MadJaples @dez_ombie @KTHopkins Excuse me? I went to university, got an education and could probably run rings around you!
@KTHopkins Hmmm...short term unemployment is excusable but months and years? Shirkers! There are jobs out there! I've never been out of one!
@JamesArthur23 as good as that whale is as your profile pic...any chance you can change it now?! We'd like to see your face again!!
@kels80 well we're "boss wankers" then!! hahahaha!

@JezTaylorGuitar I'm a vet nurse and I work night shifts! Or at least that's what I tell people...

I'm seeing a LOT of filth on my TL today...and guess what? @JezTaylorGuitar is involved in EVERY conversation...closely followed by @kels80!
@kels80 well you kept that quiet woman!! Fit brother alert!! @Sianface...you two should start a "sisters of fitties" club <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Generally, I think @KTHopkins is a huge nob but recently, I find myself agreeing with her more! Am I a nob too?! Or is she softening a bit?!
@Jennifergr8 She's going through a tantrum phase so not too cute! I manage an emergency vet clinic, always on my laptop or in the clinic.
@Jennifergr8 Hahahaha! Understandable! Mine is only 15 months. Would love to get more time with her.
@Jennifergr8 I can't watch things like that for very long! Makes me so angry! At least our children will respect us for working so hard!
@KTHopkins you make them, you pay for them! I'm a single mum and I work myself into the ground for my daughter! Its not an excuse to sponge!
@Jennifergr8 @KTHopkins Ovaries, face...hell, I'd just run the skank over! I'm a single parent and work full time (&amp; then some!). No excuse!
Good day! Got the all clear on some dodgy body bits, bought some running gear and just went for a run! First one in 5 years...barely alive!
@kels80 @kels80 still here, waiting to see consultant again x

@HelenaFarrell77 that made me cry. Can only think of those boys who have no idea that mummy isn't coming home. Heartbreaking!  RIP Peaches.
@stevebrookstein I initially thought maybe he was innocent. Now I think he's as guilty as sin! He's also a very good actor!
@JezTaylorGuitar I'm loving all of these! They need to find their way onto my ipod...
@JezTaylorGuitar @JamesArthur23 BinArthur!!!! Hahahahaha!! Crying <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #ledge

#AllTheWorldsAStage simples :-)
@kels80 Surely its not a big venue though. I was wondering how many of our band of tickets were up for grabs.
@kels80 I'm staying optimistic at the moment. If necessary, I'll pretend to faint so we get taken backstage to recover <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@_CharlyParker thanks hun. I'll crack on. Just a worrying 2 weeks of tests ahead! I know people mean well but it drives me mad! Xx
What a shite day. Wish people would stop saying "it'll be fine". How the f**k do you know?! I am allowed to worry!!
