I just love people on this earth who wouldn't be here if their mother gave in to the pressures of abortion. That's why I'm so passionate.
@NZmatthews true. Your one life wouldn't have mattered. Goodnight. God bless you
@NZmatthews but you are here! Contributing your thoughts to society. Affecting the people around you. Don't you think that has some value?
@NZmatthews and you deserve a change at life Mckenzie. When you've done something wrong, when you've been conceived you deserve a chance
@NZmatthews yes b/c you're life matters. Every human should have a chance. If your mom would have thought the way you do, you maynot be here
Going to bed. God bless all<GROWING HEART>
There are billions of human beings. One life doesn't effect anything.
@NZmatthews human life doesn't matter anyway.
