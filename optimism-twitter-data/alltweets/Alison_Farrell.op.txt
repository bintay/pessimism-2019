try and take a french fry from bill's dinner plate, go ahead, try, i'll be behind this plate glass bunker watching
@vz132 glutton/wrath combo, fuck yeah
like you know when you go someplace and you see the little thing behind the counter that says 'DO NOT SERVE' and a mugshot? that
i maintain that all human bills should look like they aren't allowed at all you can eat buffets anymore
it's a character design thing y'know??
i just hate when humanized bills aren't triangular/pear shaped like
@vz132 and all the weight goes to his hips/thighs so he is a literal triangle
aziz ansari as darth vader: nooooooo
bill cipher (see: the worst)
@vz132 [LOUD CHEERING]
@AmandaPena13 welcome to popular post hell. you can hide notes with x-kit, if you get to that point where i's driving ya bonkers.
i want aziz ansari to play everyone
@AmandaPena13 [looks at the voice of Elmo] [sighs real slow and long]
@AmandaPena13 I KNOW. I KNOW I WAS. i just cruised right out of the conversation and ollied out.
if im still tweeting at 7 o clock, somebody reach through the internet and smack the shit out of me
okay im gonna heat up my dinner, eat some more, and then 7 o clock im going to the mall for momma's day stuff.
@AmandaPena13 yeah, wouldn't blame you. that shit ain't right.
@AmandaPena13 other than that, it's just a privacy protected blog.
@AmandaPena13 awww :C well mine is only secret because i'm gross and the world doesn't need to know my kinks. &gt;_&gt;
stares into the camera like im in the office
that's why i kinda stopped RPing with a couple ppl cause, and i quote- 'i hate humanized bills, have you heard his voice? he's not black.'
@AmandaPena13 SAME??? I just got home and i was catching up on my dash and then hello racism, awful to see you today.
@AmandaPena13 that's why i made a nsfw/vent twitter. so.SO LIBERATING.

staying an hour later at work cause my boss wants to go to church
if you need to age up only one side of a ship for it to be acceptable, maybe that ship is rooted in bad decisions

L M A O theres a post on tumblr warning people that tumblr is deleting billdip blogs
@sludgebat  
@soosramirez <KISSING FACE> wow rude, mcgiggles wouldnt do this to me

@soosramirez <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
fiddleford mcgiggles
@Pandandelion :( love ya, Pand.
@GRANDFIDDLE THEY SHOULD TRY AGAIN JUST INCASE
im prob gonna drop off soon so jsyak
@GRANDFIDDLE THEY DID THEIR BEST
takes her 30-40 years and stan ripping her a new one a few times for her to finally get rid of the things he gave her haha im in pain
@vz132 'haha yyyyeeeaahhhh you can have that back if you want'
imagine THAT yard sale
shed probably get rid of all the stuffs shes kept over the years cause shes sentimental. gifts and photos and clothes and stuff ugh
im falling asleep but i keep thinkin how if carla does get to that point of really disliking stan
@vz132 Yeah thats what i was thinking! and anyway its au so whatever works really!
@vz132 but thats so many stans
@vz132 IM NOT SURE I KINDA. I like the name Sam but I get the feelin Stan would name his son after his brother, if he could.
@vz132 LMAO YOU WERE OUT BUT YE
oh god that was so much applejuice what have i done
eh i'll do replies after work tomorrow im too sleepy
yeah 
3am pizza what up
am i more hungry than i am tired or
save him 
meanwhile, remember when i had long hair? yeah me either let's never talk about it again 
i found one but it's really quiet and the footage is all weird and fucked up
guys if i can find the raws of me doing scenes from soap operas would you guys want to watch them
@AmandaPena13 theyre doing doomsday device plots on lifetime now? fuck i gotta watch more tv
i trapped a camel cricket under the plunger so i wouldnt have to be the one to deal with it
what a crazy random happenstance
everything is perfect except uh oh his twin brothers building a doomsday device
[carla spilling coffee on stan] 'omg im so sorry' 'its okay, relax... im stan.' VA: love
besides its not a romcom unless carla has a job at a high profile fashion magazine 'had it all, except for...' +
carla and vaz's stan is like a hate-com not a rom-com
@AmandaPena13 have you READ the present day threads with vaz's stan? its like two cats in a wet burlap sack
@leghaus good idea still
rom com starla closes my eyes
Y E S 
and maybe eat this other slice of pizza
IM GONNA GO SHOWER SO I DONT HAVE TO DO THAT IN THE MORNING
but the HP bar was just extended it was still the same stats so my little nerdass team fucked his shit up real good
one time this jackass kid who had gameshark in ele school was like 'FIGHT ME I'LL WIN' and he gave himself like uber hp on his mewtwo
@AmandaPena13 i could do cows. pretty much anything BUT cats, i could probably do no problem.
i do know a girl who got to do a necropsy on a shark and that was like UGHHH JEALOUSSS
@AmandaPena13 OH NO KITTIES..... idk if i could have done that. just cause i have so many cats at home.
@AmandaPena13 i love biology, in HS the AP kids got to dissect fetal pigs and i was jealous
@AmandaPena13 real dissection was fun! it was just messy and weird
and he threw it at this girl and she screamed a lot
and then that kid who used to send me fake love letters from other classmates found a rubber band inside his frog's stomach
@leghaus i didnt think so, but we still had to do it. and then hand the paper covered in glue and frog parts in for a grade.
but let me tell you, it is not a simple task
now, i don't know if you've ever had to use elmer's glue to adhere a frog's liver to a piece of printer paper
we were supposed to remove the internal organs and glue them to a piece of paper
i had a science teacher who had us dissect frogs in 7th grade, which was p cool except like
@GRANDFIDDLE FOLLOW UR HEART
i was gonna finish playing it but then i started self shipping with archie and it was all downhill from there
secret i never finished playing alpha sapphire i'm a sham
'use hydropump' i hate my friends
i had a friend who named her boyfriend's penis blastoise
pretty sure i named blastoise stan
i should skim through my pokemon games
@GRANDFIDDLE closes eyes
@AmandaPena13 correct
@AmandaPena13 what if giant space rock DO care
am i bitter about pluto? no, but i do think it's funny that humanity looks at big rocks in space and goes 'im gonna name that what i want'
@AmandaPena13 because humanity likes to pretend its decisions about the classification of celestial bodies is law
@AmandaPena13 ew. REAL food? ew.
@AmandaPena13 oooooh i can use that word in a sentence but i cannot define it frick
@GRANDFIDDLE  
granted nobody ever sent me much to begin with BUT
i wish carla got more anon questions. nobody ever sends me anything anymore
i don't feel like doing most of these replies rn
oh fuck i unironically relate to a dril tweet  
carla feels nothing for rev!stan except the explicit desire to wrap him up in a blanket and put him someplace safe
carla's feelings on rev!stan can be summed up with 'awww he's so pathetic i can barely look at him without wanting to cry'
ever since pen mentioned stan and carla sleeping with a baby between them i have been an absolute wreck
@GRANDFIDDLE omf i have a friend who once snapchatted me a vid of her face while she was peeing, just her neutral expression and the sound
@GRANDFIDDLE IF YOU DID I WAS NOT AROUND FOR IT
'what did you do to my nails?!'
'i CLEANED them'
[thinks about dipeon body swap] it would just be like the episode where fry gets the robot devils hands
@vz132 vaz my sweet. what should we name this stan and carla child?
@vz132 my 'meme' tag might have some in there for ya
'you married a statue and i didnt get to see the preachers face?????m
i dont think carla rly cares if her and stan never end up together again she'll be mostly annoyed she wasnt invited to the vegas wedding
@soosramirez @vz132 'im unsurprised and proud of your willingness to commit.'
@ghostbumblebee the punchin pines and kickin mccorkle god bless
@ghostbumblebee he tells everyone thats his girlfriend, everyone already knows, but he keeps telling them
kickin carla mccorkle
@ghostbumblebee HHHOOOO GOD BLESS shes got the legs and the speed that stan will never have
@ghostbumblebee MMMMMM YEEAHH
'youre horrible at this'
'yeah but i look cute in these shorts so whose complaining?'
'not me, noo noo not me'
carla being A W F U L at boxing but she and stan still have fun messing around at the gym
still holding out hope for ponytail author
@vz132 'really? the stan o war is getting murdered by a six month old? oh how far the mighty fall.'
@vz132 all the tweets you made just killed me
@vz132 my new starla tag is ;;flowers in your fez
@vz132 screams quietly
what if i made tintin icons and used them for my mun face
@vz132 im so bored and i have like 3 hours to go still help me
wwwooooorrkkkk 
somebody help me fill the next four hours of mind numbing dullness
'love me' i whisper into the void
waiting for a response from an rper you were terrified to message is the worst
@GRANDFIDDLE ow
you think bill ever throws nightmares about  his brother or carla at stan
its a good thing i left for work early BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO FUCKING DRIVE
child me was a mess 
uggghhh i woke up later than planned so no rp replies for me until later
@GRANDFIDDLE ITS TOO SMALL OH MY GOD 
shes kind of an idiot.
she saved everything- photos, gifts, mementos. shes had reminders of how good it was everywhere she looked.
carlas too sentimental is the problem
me sad @ 6 am thanx @vz132 
@vz132 oh god
im so tired what am j doing
@vz132 i get the vibe that if this dip knew that carla was in town he'd make it a Mission or smth lmao
@vz132 I SHOULD BE SLEEPIN BUT IM VERY CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE THIS CONVO WITH DIPPER GOES
'yeesh'
'hey, you don't turn out no prize either'
'YOU'RE stanford pines? the swell fella who i'm going steady with?'
fuck imagine teenage carla meeting old man stan
@vz132 id be a filthy liar if i said i wasnt quietly rooting for that
@vz132 oh to get a glimpse inside the conflicted mess of a heart and head that is stan
maybe i'll just do it til it gets boring
fuck how long should i make this magic anon last they didn't specify that either
@vz132 oh im reading it. tho he certainly dont love her no more SO I MEAN NOT A... TOTAL LIE...
THAT'LL BE FUUUUUUUN
they didn't get super into specifics but i'm gonna roll with teenage body and mind so
carla got a magic anon that's turned her into a teenager again
oh my god
carla 'no no i'm fully aware that i'm adorable but please tell me again' mccorkle
carla wearing stan's shirt more like in the name of the father son and the holy spirit AMEN
@vz132 I CAN DIG IT. getting their nails done together 'you can do better, flower!' 'i know i know, you're right'
i need to commission someone to draw carla drinking a margarita with a very smug look on her face
so i'm like 'hahah yes talk about carla stan' my carla side is like 'HAHA SUCK IT OLD MAN'
lit it's so weird with ur stan because now carla is turning bitter and spiteful towards him
@vz132 OF COURSE I WOULD. STAN HAVING TO FACE HIS EMOTIONS? THE ULTIMATE COMEDY FOR ME AND CARLA
@vz132 HAHAHAHHA Y E S
i'm going to miss this old boy when he goes..
littelfoot's laying in my lap just purring up a storm while i pet his head
old stan and carla falling asleep next to one another and it's the best sleep either of them has had in years
'this movie was better sixty years ago'
'yeah. yeah it was.'
the day does come when they flop down on a couch with carla's head on stan's shoulder so they can watch grandpa the kid on dusty old vhs
and it takes a long time and a lot of bad jokes and a lot of silent apologies but
the truth is they missed each other
being too tired to be angry and bitter anymore
angry and shouting and blaming and then
just these old battered souls who almost ha it but got lost along the way somehow
old starla is literally my favorite fucking thing
@vz132 I DID. I'M SAD. I LOVE STARLA SO FUCKING MUCH I
carla: actively struggling not to ask this sweating, nervous old man if there's a banana in his pocket or if he's just glad to see her
@PHUZface mutters something about him needing the room
@vz132 oh god what song
i guess carla needs her men to strike that balance of nerd and jerk
it's like obligatory flirting
carla thinks this rev!stan is cute but so far there's no spark
precious old bastard
im going to cradle stan pines gently to my bosom
@vz132 small son
this rev!stan is definitely a bottom and carla is probably going to wreck him js
@vz132 oh my fucking god
@vz132 [SALUTES]
@vz132 hmmmm try this playlist, it's a good'un 
@vz132 anything in particular?
@vz132 i hate this fucking game but i can't stop playing it
GOD
A
AM
I
IT TOOK ME ALL DAY BUT I BEAT MINTY MEADOWS IN CANDY CRUSH
sometimes i look at stanford pines and i hear ariel from the little mermaid in my head, clear as bell, saying 'DADDY I LOVE HIM'
he's so happy and so stupid 
@vz132 hahahah GOOD
whyyyy is everything so dead tonight ugh
@vz132 it's pretty liberating, i gotta say. just a sideblog for all the  sexy stuff to go to? it's nice.
@vz132 I HOPE YOU LIKE SMUTTY REPLIES BECAUSE I REBLOGGED THAT SEXY THREAD TO MY NSFW BLOG AND IT'S WAITING FOR YOU, VAZ
LRT somebody put a stop to ron perlman he's far too cute
Photo Credit alonatal 
there's more politics than shitposting on my twitter feed right now that's not acceptable
just being thanked at all for a theory post is weird to me
there should be a 'sweetie :)' at the end of that
'ur wrong but thanks for trying'
that feels very passive aggressive
i dont mind being told im wrong but why are you thanking me
and then proceed to tell me i'm wrong
i hate when people thank me for writing a theory post
SENDING THE FIRST MESSAGE TO SOMEONE ELSE 
im gonna do it im gonna send this rper a message because i want to rp with them
breathes in deeply
i learned about clipping groups today
in this corner,  250 pounds of pure, grade A pain in the ass 
[thinks about darius rucker][inhales sharply]
this song is so good 
i was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band~
@AmandaPena13 @soosody you Cannot leave your TL alone amanda
@kittanking i wouldnt be surprised if that was real
thing that cracks me up every fuckin time: 'Indie. Selective. Iago from Aladdin.'
@soosody @AmandaPena13 oh my god.
@AmandaPena13 RIGHT JUST. so not at all what I would expect. tho pebble and the penguin is SO GOOD MM. SO GOOD.
its so weird to me that people RP spongebob
@AmandaPena13 nah it's great!! i'm just like. sometimes i get a starter and i stare at it forever before anything comes to me. @_@
@AmandaPena13 ive been staring at this drew starter for days  and struggling i promise i'll reply to it someday
stan has zero game and zero ass
stan can barely hit on one woman let alone multiple women at the same time
@nymbulxus me @ people who think stan cheated on carla at all 
i still have all the muppets christmas carol sound track on my ipod
INHALES. im gonna message this stan
@nymbulxus same??? god. GOD. they're so cute i hate everything.
@GRANDFIDDLE growin up so fast [tear]
@vz132 STAN AND CARLA ARE GONNA HOOK UP IN THE AFTERLIFE
@vz132 suUUSUUSHHSHSHH VAZ
sweaty palm lOSERS
sweaty awkward children knocking teeth and noses together trying to kiss and being all red in the face and nervous
i actually rly want to RP teenage starla
@nymbulxus its literally about them like i cant. believe.
@nymbulxus the anthem
@soosramirez @soosody vital to your interests 
look at how many buttons stan has undone 
[climbs mount everest][cups hands to mouth][yells as loud as possible] STAN AND CARLA WERE EACH OTHER'S FIRST KISS
idk what that's all about. :C my lil old man.
and he goes dead limp and is rly hard to wake up to calm him down
littlefoot twitches so hard in his sleep these days
@Pandandelion FUCK. YEAHHHHHHH
dip and ley end up befriending an alien
mabel plays alien apocalypse matchmaker while dipper and ley try to figure out if they can bring back alien tech
stan being all like 'relax carla i'll make sure the aliens don't get you' and she just kicks one of them into orbit
@vz132 that too
@soosramirez ley 'don't leave the house without your musket' pines
@Pandandelion WILL YOU TEACH ME HOW TO DO MAKE UP SO I LOOK LESS LIKE A SLOTH
its cool tho they kiss at the end
@vz132 JUST ALIEN ACTION MOVIE WITH A B PLOT OF STAN  AND CARLA YELLING AT EACH OTHER A LOT
i want stan to look into an abduction pod and see carla and be like 'somebody else wanna open this one or can we just leave it'
the stans + dip mabel, &amp; soos go to the mothership to rescue abductees and convince the aliens to back off or else they'll destroy the town
thompson's van gets tricked out with rockets
mcgucket and his son manning the ground team w/ all these machines, arming the teenagers to protect the town
+ mothership and rescue the abductees.
and they're abducting people and half the shack pack has to stay behind to fight off aliens but the other half has to go up to the +
i have this whole plot mapped out in my head with aliens trying to pull up a crashed UFO from beneath the town
i want the gravity falls movie to be the town VS aliens
@soosramirez @vz132 quietly brings back toymaker mcgucket
@Pandandelion jesus chRIST YOU'RE LIKE THE COOLEST PERSON I KNOWW HAT THE FUCK IS THIS
@Pandandelion you're living a life i can only aspire to, pand
big brows, big nose, funky chins, idek just gimme something that makes me look twice
there are enough brad pitts in the world gimme something NEW to look at
i really like faces that have interesting features like
every bioware character i've made in the last few years has a big hooked nose
@vz132 this is some of the highest praise i've ever received
@vz132 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@vz132 big boogers?
i love character with bulbous noses, crooked noses, hooked, flares, muppet, come on gimme the SCHNOZ
gimme the big honkin nose okay
@vz132 i KNOW. like. idk people slim down his nose to make him more 'handsome' i think and its like nO
kinda drives me nuts when people don't give stan a huge nose
the sexual tension between you and someone who is into the same things but haven't said anything to each other yet
@GRANDFIDDLE I HAD AN OCTILLERY ONCE......
just picture me wide-eyed hiding in the bushes eyeing up stan blogs that ship starla and there you have it
im a lot more like mabel than im willing to admit tbqh
'im gonna go to the mall today' i said, about ten times 
[looks at clock]
... i can go on saturday it's fine
@LovelyLadyLomps DELETE THIS
@GRANDFIDDLE it's a good song
i always forget gangam style is on my ipod
oh right 
@GRANDFIDDLE HELL YES. and then he just needed to apply the ability to make the sounds so he could SPEAK those languages.
@GRANDFIDDLE B)))))
apes learn sign language why not octopus pretending to be a grad student who eventually takes over the prestigious dr brine's life
octopus learning sign language
also who says dave needed to SPEAK first
@GRANDFIDDLE i mean if you go by that scientific mentor thing...
@soosody YYEEESSSSS
+ make duck calls so like. dave could have  done a lot of crazy shit to learn and be capable of using human speech.
i remember watching that alaska the last frontier show and they killed a duck and used the ducks throat/vocal chord equivalent to +
@GRANDFIDDLE MAYBE! or he built a translator out of junk parts IDK THE WORLD IS UR OYSTER
what if he ended up in a lab and was experimented on and thats how he can tall#k
@GRANDFIDDLE infiltrated a lab as an octopus? went in thru the vents and used the equipment/supplies when nobody was around?
@soosody can always stream it again! ill watch hellboy every day of the week
[thinks about hellboy last night] nice
@BigBardaFree 'imported swedish vodka'
i mean it was 72 years ago but STILL
why did you have to die you were so beautiful
sometimes i think- oh yeah, leslie howard for young fids 
@GRANDFIDDLE maybe he pulled a meowth and taught himself? or developed some kinda syrum/device?
@Pandandelion !!! BILL !!
especially starla baby conversations??? how dare my body betray me such as this
@Pandandelion AHH is that bill or ted?
i always fall asleep during GR8 conversations its the worst
@GRANDFIDDLE ALSO I AM SORRY I FELL ASLEEP LAST NIGHT ON SKYPE
@GRANDFIDDLE OH... MY GOSH...... MMMMMMM
xkit mobile turns vaz into mystery knuckles 
im gonna hop to mobile ill do real replies tomorrow i sucked a lot at RP today
smoll 
my mom didn't sign the permission slip for this feel trip
i cant believe how much carla affects him 30-40 years down the line what the fuck what the Fuck i did not ask for this
sAVE HIM.............. 
'i love my weirdass grunkle' 
I BET THEY GO BOWLING ALL THE TIME
BUT THEY GET ALONG SO WELL WHEN THEY DO LOOK AT THEM 
I STILL LOVE... SO MUCH WHEN DIPPER AND STAN BOND TOGETHER CAUSE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AS MUCH BUT IT DOES
stan's default term of affection is 'lol ur a fuckin geek'
@GRANDFIDDLE show me the boob
@GRANDFIDDLE look at this human boob
@vz132 IDT HE'S THE ONLY ASSHOLE BUT I THINK HE'S THE ONLY ONE AT THIS PARTICULAR LEVEL OF ASSHOLE-ITUDE
@GRANDFIDDLE  carla's husband in spirit FOR ALL THE CRYING AND THE HURT/COMFORT MM THATS GOOD SHIP
@vz132 SHRUG IDK she wants to make amends but she won't kill herself trying to have a life in gravity falls
IDK where she'll go or w/e if she does but i guess it just means that old carla isn't going ever see vaz's present day stan ever again
tbh if it keeps up she's just going to leave gravity falls altogether- she's not gonna survive feeling the way she's feeling if she stays.
i never expected carla to feel so absolutely exhausted like this, it's so strange.
@vz132 
@vz132 IT'S NOT EVEN WAR CAUSE HE MAKES CARLA TOO TIRED TO FIGHT BACK
@GRANDFIDDLE SHE'S SO TIRED IT'S... IT'S BAD.
it's so weird cause carla's usually so optimistic and happy and full of life but vaz's stan makes her so tired and old feeling.
lmao vaz is the only one who has played a stan so brutal that carla's actually starting to hate him
@vz132 that's sort of the only thing he does, tbh.
@leghaus if you,,, WANT i guess. gonna need somebody to catch him so he doesn't hurt himself falling over.
@vz132  stan is making carla's life such a struggle i am in love with it
@leghaus she'll throw him a bone. you know what? i'd say it is. high praise from hotpants.
@leghaus you know you can be surprisingly reassuring when you aren't being such an ass.
@leghaus well as long as he doesnt... head for the hills. ill tell him. in a bit. wipe the smug off your face.
@leghaus carla covering her eyes with her hands like. this fucking guy. '... in your 'EXPERT' opinion, how do you think he'll react?'
@leghaus i can't tell him yet okay it's too soon.
@leghaus she's just standing there like of course he memorized it, of course he did, he's stanley pines, of fucking courSE HE DID
@leghaus oh my god stanley how the hell do you even know??? what did you do, memorize my cycle?
@leghaus what?? tell him what? what's to tell?
'so when are you going to tell my brother?'
'WHAT HAHA IDK WHAT UR TALKIN ABOUT.....'
'woman, you're a damn open book'
still really on that 'stanley finds out carla's pregnant before stan' thing like my god
anyway forget about sad starla g4g theories let's talk about them dancing more 
@Spongefan12 too pure. too good.
i dont think carla could ever shoot anybody
@GRANDFIDDLE BUT REALLY THO.....
@AmandaPena13 carla said stan cant see his kid, so author frames stan so stan can take his place and see his kid. I THINK.
@AmandaPena13 im rly not sure. carla's pregnant, maybe it's- OH WAIT I GET IT. It's doing g4g theory except i guess +
@AmandaPena13 omg... im just not sure whats happening in it. i think author killed thistle? then carla thought it was stan so she shot him.
@AmandaPena13 I DONT KNOW?? IM CONfused. author drove the van off a cliff?? i think?? im sad
@vz132  OKAY IA CTUALLY REPLIED THIS TIME
@vz132 same haha
@vz132 h im big,,
@vz132 ACCIDENTALLY REBLOGGED WITHOUT PUTTING ANYTHING IN THE REPLY LET ME UH. FIX THAT.
@vz132 SAME THO
IM SO
CARLA WOULD NEVER SHOOT STAN
caps lock the musical
@vz132 I LOVE PORK
@vz132 I LOVE YOU A BUNCH AND ALSO I REPLIED TO THE DRUNK THING
STARLA IS BASICALLY HELLBOY AND LIZ IM SO GLAD WE ALL LOVE DYING SO MUCH
I LOVE MY FRIENDS
@vz132 SCREAMS OH BOY........
@vz132 im scared and i just know this is gonna make me cry but YEHA.....
@vz132 WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT, I WAS KIND OF THINKING OLD WOULD BE... INTERESTING. BUT ITS UP TO YOU.
@AmandaPena13 @vz132 mystery and bra
@vz132 a lot of dips and mabels are just in it for shipping i think. :/
@vz132 THEN ILL SEND YOU MORE STUFF CAUSE GDI I LOVE RPING WITH STAN EVEN IF IT SHATTERS MY SOUL HALF THE TIME
@vz132 i would send you more memes but we have a lot of threads i dont wanna overload you. D: i love you.
STREAM STARTING 
@GRANDFIDDLE SO MUCH BUT SO MUCH GOOD
hey so im setting up to stream Hellboy if folks want to join 
@GRANDFIDDLE  the ideal 
hellboy will probably be finished downloading AT 9 so maybe streaming at like 9:15
listening to ron perlman's jerry lewis impression is my favorite thing
i also want to stream hellboy with the cast commentary because that's just as good as the movie itself
@Pandandelion HELL YEAH HELL YEAH THATS THE GOAL
ill have at least three months rent saved up by the time i move tho im doing pretty solid on my 'alison panics about everything' buffer
i just want all my bases covered
probably gonna have to pick up a second job once i move unless i ask for more hours, which im gonna do anyway BUT
lAUGHS AT REV!STAN PICK UP LINE CHOICES HOW DO I EVEN RESPOND
@FarkledAgain !!! ; -; OH MY GOSH ALYSSA....... i love you too oh my goodness idk what to say
every time people equate stan and carla to garnet in the crystal pines AU, my heart grows a size
9 PM HELLBOY STREAM THATS EASTERN TIME FOR YOU PACIFIC AND WEST COASY FOLKS
@Pandandelion HELL YEAH
@Pandandelion HMMM HOW ABOUT 9PM?
WHAT TIME SHOULD I STREAM FOR MAXIMUM FRIENDSHIP LEVELA
TONIGHTS THE NIGHT I STREAM HELLBOY
@soosramirez MMM I NEED STAN OH GOLLY
@GRANDFIDDLE omg... so good... so dumb so good. def my childhood game of choice tbh.

@AmandaPena13 i cant remember what ive had specifically from there but i always enjoy my meal
i drank all my applejuice <GRIMACING FACE><GRIMACING FACE><GRIMACING FACE>
@GRANDFIDDLE Y E S
out of work, time to party 
@GRANDFIDDLE draw aaaaaa bear

@soosody oooooh yEAH YEAH YEAH
@soosody i don't know what that means. D:
GOD he was going to WRECK her.
closes eyes. what could have been.
oh man... the thread where bill was grooming carla to become his personal servant/puppet.
[finds pregnant carla art from five months ago] i was trash from the very beginning
a simpler time 
@soosramirez i think i drew stanley once wearing the one that says '*laminated paper wobbling noise*'
@soosramirez EVERYTHING from zazzle poetry
stan owning shirts that don't apply to him was something i thought would be funny 
you guys shouldn't be letting me go through oldart BUT I AM
the meme team is star trek nerds dont disagree with me on this 
doc and i were talking about atlantis crossovers 
if you skim through the 'munart' tag on 30yearslost you go on a real adventure lemme tell ya
@vz132 IT'S A DUMB AND DUMBER JOKE
why do i have stan wearing a 'free mustache rides' shirt? i dont know but i drew it
i was making quality content five months ago 
lmao remember when times were simple and good 
where's that picture i drew of bill telling stanley his son just turned 16 while stanley realized how long it had been
i havent talked about stanley a lot i should talk more about my stanley some more
@soosramirez roughly around the time a few years in when he realized nobody was coming for him
i need to RP my stanley more i think i'm the only one on tumblr that's still just a big chubby grandpa
stan asking ley if his brother found BOFA yet
@SweetMcGurran light up velcro sneakers
half the conversations i have with pen end with 'DONT DO THIS' 'IT'S DONE'
@soosramirez IM. I GOTTA. I HAVE TO LAY DOWN. IM. OHHHH BOY.......
@GRANDFIDDLE a small
robbie vibes me as the kind of guy who makes punk/emo photoshop edits of disney characters
unless we're mining the meadowlands for all the bodies that have been dumped there
and if we do IDK what we're mining
22 years ive lived in jersey i dont think we HAVE mines
at least from what ive been skimming
i think someone in the carla tag has a hc that carla worked in a mine to support the family?
HE'S SO HAPPY I BET HE'S ONLY EVER GOTTEN KISSED ON THAT CHEEK BY WEIRD RELATIVES BEFORE THEN
i cant believe i have this gif in icon'd format 
@vz132 IM WHEEZING
VAZ
@vz132 FUCK IM CRYIN
@vz132 YOU MADE ME HONK. I LOVE THIS TWEET.
like the show canonically has him (badly) flirting with women and having sexy magazines of women stan is bi, pan, or straight, my friends
@vz132 SO FEW PEOPLE PLAY STAN AS LIKING WOMEN IT'S SO STRANGE TO ME
deep dark fears- that the measuring tape is going to snap backwards and slice my eye up
[watches this stan blog drift further and further into fiddlestan territory] we'll always have paris
im always scared they're gonna forget and just keep filling the tank until i can't afford to pay
i love when gas station attendees make sure you said a certain amount of money
@GFPinecest well. i'm not really sure what you want me to say to any of this, so. okay, then!
bbiab
anyway I'm in the car now so I'm not gonna die tweeting about pinecest
@GFPinecest oh I've seen them. I'm one of them. that's why I thought maybe you wouldn't want to be skimming and faving my tweets.
@GFPinecest okay? I can't tell if you're trying to pick a fight with me or make friends with me.
@GFPinecest I didn't want someone faving smth and engaging with smth that explicitly insults a thing they enjoy. I let you know, that's all.
@GFPinecest why do you keep thinking I'm fighting with you? at what point have I been antagonistic?
okay i really am going to put gas in my car now
@GFPinecest uhh. alright. whatever you wanna roll with, pal. i won't fight ya.
@GFPinecest yeah, i went out of my way. why would i WANT someone to be favoriting things that are insulting something they like?
&gt;lets somebody know they faved me insulting a thing they like
&gt;why are you mad at me
&gt;k
@GFPinecest in what way did i get mad? u faved me insulting something u like. if u knew it was an insult, that means ur looking for drama.
@GFPinecest actually, it was. so what im getting is you just fav every tweet that involves pinecest without looking at the context? nice.
@vz132 yeah and just watch carla's gonna end up being just as filthy and a perv
@GFPinecest that tweet you faved was not a compliment JSYK
@vz132 VERY HOT??? im sorry they're two people in a mutual committed relationship being flirty and pervy with each other that's very hot
@vz132 shit's about to get steamy
@vz132 i hope this thread continues because HOT DANG also im probably gonna reply to it on my nsfw blog cause
THAT WAS HOT
@vz132 YOU AREN'T YOU ARENT AT ALL GOOD GRACIOUS
'im rusty with nsfw' VAZ YOU LIAR

@vz132 SAME AHAHA
@soosody THIS IS GOOD TOO OH GOSH
@vz132 THIS IS THE PICTURE I USED FOR CARLA'S NSFW BLOG
@vz132 carla knows exactly what she's doing.
@GRANDFIDDLE I KNOW. I KNOW. IM SO. WHY DO WE KEEP GETTING MORE AND MORE DEPRESSING?
stares into the camera
now g4g has moved onto 'stan was in colombia for 10 years and effectively abandoned his family' great
@leghaus YE S. GHOUL TOWNSFOLK.
I DREAMED A DREAM OF TIME GONE BYYYYY
grunkle4grandpa is progressively sucking the joy out of starla and carla mccorkle
now it's full of anguish
the carla mccorkle tag used to be full of joy
i want stan and carla as will and elizabeth but stan would also make a great barbossa
ley as jack, fids as gibbs
pirates of the caribbean AU
leans back

@vz132 VIBRATES EXCITEDLY
i need carla and stan to pilot a jaeger
@AmandaPena13 maybe??? i didnt get that far
@AmandaPena13 all i know of the sequel is that elphaba spends a long time with her son and bullying him except she doesnt know hes her son
@GRANDFIDDLE 80 yr old gid calling dipper 'the boy' 'I'M OLDER THAN YOU'
@leghaus i can dig both of these things. green dipper and wheelchair mabel. her chair is decked out with about a zillion rhinestones.
@GRANDFIDDLE just dipper going 'RADIO SHACK?' 'i need you to stop'
@leghaus I WANT MABEL TO SING DANCING THROUGH LIFE
@leghaus maybe this is a bad au
@GRANDFIDDLE is this dipeon 
@vz132 euGH
@leghaus yyyyeaahhhh
@AmandaPena13 yeeahhh i remember being like ??? for a lot of the book
im gonna go ahead and say that irl mabel probably doesn't wanna bang her twin brother
'i ship pinecest! i'm basically IRL mabel'
thing that gets me about pinecest shippers is you get like, the same thing over and over again in their personal descriptions
@vz132 i have SO MANY pinecest followers i got no idea what's upw ith that
@vz132 well hurry up then im very needy and very excited
the book was depressing as fuck to my recollection
@leghaus mm. probably the play? i remember the play better than i remember the book rn.
@vz132 NO RUSH NO RUSH im just a big whiny nerdbutt
fuck it just give me a dipeon wicked au that's how deep in the trash i am
for you see my room mate is... 'unusual and exceedingly peculiar and altogether quite a pain in my rear to describe'
'short'
@vz132 it's always tin tin
but of course i'll watch out for mabel
but of course i'll RIIIIIISE above it
thre's been some confusion over rooming here at camp
dip and gid in the same room together AKA 'loathing' from wicked
@GRANDFIDDLE FAIR ENOUGH. DIPPER AND GID IN THE SAME CABIN THO.
@GRANDFIDDLE Y E S.
@GRANDFIDDLE WHO OWNS THE SUMMER CAMP? STAN? THE NORTHWESTS? BUD GLEEFUL? WHAT ABOUT RIVAL SUMMER CAMPS?
im thinking about gravity falls summer camp au again pen help me
just put me in one of those hannibal lecter face masks and drop me in a cell shut me up end me
i can only breathe heavily over vaz's shoulder for old people falling in love again for so long
@GRANDFIDDLE THERE IT ISSS
we need more good stan RPers so i can RP all my shitty starla AUs without constantly harassing the same ones that exist already
succubus carla
@leghaus 'stop doing experiments on your brother' while stan writhes in pain on the ground
@AmandaPena13 @GRANDFIDDLE D: idk how i feel about that
fiddlefuckhardonmcsuckit is already taken it's jim's nsfw blog
hadron's his street name
THERE ARE TEARS IN MY EYES
@GRANDFIDDLE AHHAHAHAHA
@GRANDFIDDLE hadronwithahardon
i have a terrible URL suggestion but i know pen is going to yell at me if i say it
stan/carla vampire au more like ahhaa you've activated my trap card
@GRANDFIDDLE .... opens google doc
@GRANDFIDDLE THAT'S THE PLAN
@GRANDFIDDLE I WAS JUST THINKING.... SHE REALLY DOESN'T LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT BETWEEN TEEN/ADULT SO...
man i told myself i was gonna draw vampire carla tonight
@GRANDFIDDLE URL idea: mcgXracoonwife5evr
i don't know what im doing right now
fiddlefreak hardrock mcheadbang
and idk where fxddleford is
fxddleford and fragmentii are solid fiddles from what i've seen but fragmentii is on hiatus until week after next
'IT'LL SHOOT A FLY OFF A DOG'S BACK AT 100 YARDS, TANNEN'
THIS MAN IS PURE COUNTRY
@GRANDFIDDLE FIDS WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE A RIFLE
@GRANDFIDDLE OKAY CONSIDER
fids pterodactyl-tron runs off of sarcasm
fiddleford 'little shit' mcgucket
'not this'
if you looked up 'beautiful' in the dictionary there would be a picture of stan with a big red X over his face
what was weirder is that fids was talking to a gargrunkle when he said he was beautiful
any shippy RP that starts getting 'i couldn't live without you, ur eyes are a sunset' i have to back slowly away from
@GRANDFIDDLE YE IT'S LIKE. IT'S WEIRD. LIKE RLY ROMANTIC STUFF LIKE 'UR EYES ARE LIKE DIAMONDS' STUFF
@GRANDFIDDLE and i mean like fids and stan saying how beautiful they think the other is level of shmoop
@GRANDFIDDLE just one active one, that i've seen. and every RP i've seen them do has been very... shmoopy fiddlestan.
i hate fiddlestan so much im sorry im sorry i feel so bad im sorry
@GRANDFIDDLE its the Stan rper that I accidentally got into Starla they've betrayed me
'i started shipping fiddlestan' don't go where i can't follow
unbelievable 
i capped so much of stan being sad and still missing carla in boyz crazy i should make icons
“…tv show!”
“…commercial!”
“…movie!”
“…joke!”
“…video game!”
“…ubiquitous, inescapable, tacitly accepted…
i love stan's stupid face 
'stan and dipper don't get along or like one another' lies.png 
he falls/rolls out of the car and he just stays like this 
@soosody CLOSES EYES
i hope stan changed in the car while driving
i love that stan runs outside in his underpants, and then like is magically wearing his suit
mind control
that's less hypnotism and more straight up brainwashing
'YOU ARE NOW UNDER MY CONTROL, YOUR MIND IS MINE'
@soosramirez at this point anyone could be anybody's grandparent
@soosody i feel like it did tho, just not at all the way it was supposed to or smth idk
he says he ripped it off some other band and im like well what other band??? what band has hypnotic tunes that sound acoustic and twangy?
cause see my theory is that robbie uses the same song thistle used on carla
: o
i love when stan's mouth is just a couple of pixels 
save them 
DIPPER AND STAN GET ALONG SO GOOD IN THIS EPISODE LOOK AT HIM LOOKING AT HIS GRUNK LIKE 'ur weird but i like you' 
stan makes a lot of really great faces in boyz crazy
@Pandandelion I AM ROOTING FOR YOU!!! YOU'RE GONNA BE AMAZING!
@soosramirez honey nut feelios 
the brown meat
HE STILL!!! MISSES HER!!! END ME 
HE'S STILL SO SAD ABOUT IT I HATE THIS 
@soosody yyyesssssss
totally alone
carla standing there like... '... i didnt want this.'
so now you A: don't know what the fuck happened with u and ur first bf, and B: ur new man just bailed and so did ur old bf so ur like 'wat'
1- you dump your longterm bf for another guy out of the blue
2- ex drives your new man's van off a cliff
3- new man says 'fuck it' and bails
and how shitty that must have been if you roll with the hypnosis theory like i do like
@soosody i knoOOW im sorry i wish we had confirmation of what they were like U GH
like idk just thinking about how if your new gal's ex shows up and totals your car??? shit
sometimes i wonder if thistle was like 'man you aren't worth the hassle' after stan drove the van off the cliff
someone rp this hippie bastard with me
I LOVE!!! WHEN PEOPLE DRAW CARLA AND THISTLE!!!! IT MAKES ME SO MAD!
@spinningsea several fiestas are the best kinds of fiestas.

@BigBardaFree confirmed

any time i see ppl talking about citta i think about a realtor in my hometown
im sitting up in bed look how good i am at being productive
@AmandaPena13 i didn't know that about blocking though, I'll be sure to do it.
@AmandaPena13 no just some random personal, fanqueen14 reblogs Stan and Carla threads from me sometimes and also my mun day selfie :/
@AmandaPena13 still gonna reblog my shit tho :C what's worse is there's this one that puts 'MORE PLEASE MORE' in the tags
i queued a lot of fiddleauthor last night im just remembering
i want fiddleauthor to shove fiddlestan off a cliff and take center stage as the alpha ship
I HATE THIS GAME IM IN HELL 
@PHUZface i think it's got a very good chance, it's being looked at the wrong way by a lot of people but yeah. no chill on hiatus. :/
also good god STOP reblogging my RPs i know you guys want starla on your blogs but these are active roleplays for fucks sake
and man im rooting for grunkle4grandpa but we're missing a vital piece and folks are turning it into a gatdamn soap opera
@PHUZface yeah it happened with every other theory too. inevitably we start walking down the gritty nolan-verse road of theorizing.
i love g4g but some of this stuff? too much. too dark. too REAL for this.
im not about the dark dim and depressing road grunkle4grandpa theory has taken idc if its realistic its not within the vein of the show
who keeps 35k worth of jewelry in their MINIVAN?  
ANIMORPHS AU
if ya need me ill be on mobile~
you know what im just gonna lay in bed and think about stan and carla scenarios
@jesuisgroot ITS EATING THE WARDEN, AND THEN ITS GOING TO EAT ME. MAKER NOOOOOOO
@jesuisgroot IT... IS... ALIVE...
@jesuisgroot i actually think its lelianas song??? which makes it all the more bizarre i have no idea what's up with that 'mood music'
@jesuisgroot [careless whisper playing in the distance except on a kazoo]
@AmandaPena13 'meet me in the pIT sucka'
earlier than usual but EH
you know what i might just go to bed now
wtf bobcat is so cute wtf i hate
@GRANDFIDDLE FATALITY
kill the hippie
closes eyes
imagine if he met THISTLE again
i mean regardless of what happened idrt stan blamed her for everything that happened, he seemed HURT more than anything else BUT LIKE
talk a lot about how stan would act if he saw carla but like
@AmandaPena13 BASICALLY.
granted 'set the bar for feminist media in the 90s' was like. multiple women who have goals.
@AmandaPena13 + then, and he hasn't moved with it. So he's trapped in dickweed land where he thinks he's gr8 but he's not.
@AmandaPena13 yeah he's... a self righteous jerkwad. he set the bar for feminist media in the 90s, but the bar's been raised higher since +
@AmandaPena13 no, she played cordelia on buffy/angel and joss fired her/killed off her character when she got pregnant IRL.
@AmandaPena13 back away slowly, don't make eye contact, and don't mention charisma carpenter.
@soosody aDDED and that's cool i just always start thinking about starla around midnight and so i figured id let folks now
if were mutuals and u wanna talk about starla u can fuckin have my skype just take it take it and let me cry at u
@AmandaPena13 IT'LL PUT HAIR ON YOUR CHEST not like you need any more BUT STILL
i forgot to download hellboy but IDT anybody is really on right now anyway
@AmandaPena13 IT IS but she's soooo cute..... ; -; SUCK IT UP, STANNO.
@soosody GOD IM JUST. SO PROUD. SO PROUD THAT SHE'S DEVELOPING HER OWN MIND AND IS GOING TO BE OPEN TO THE WORLD AND YES GIRL YOU GO!
i suddenly really want a cheeseburger
@soosody YEAH I THINK I HEARD THAT FROM YOU I'M SO PROUD OF HER
@nymbulxus HELL YEAH HELL YEAH. MEET IN SKYPE TO PLOT/CHAT ABOUT WHATCHA WANNA DO?
@nymbulxus Y E S. nym if you ever... nym i love baby aus if you wanna rp babies i will rp babies with you So FAST

SQUAD 
it was different when i had 30 followers that were all RPers, but now i've got 410 and they're all personal blogs.
@AmandaPena13 + i think yeah, any nsfw/risque threads are going to go there from now on because there's a lot of young teens followin me. :&lt;
@AmandaPena13 i do have a nsfw/vent blog for carla, and TBH I don't DO smutty threads enough for it to really be an issue, but like... +
the more 15 year olds start following me the less comfortable i feel doing any NSFW threads on carla
@jesuisgroot ME EITHER i used to have to alt+tab and screencap cause i didn't know if it was working or not.
@GRANDFIDDLE START W/ THE BOOTY
@Pandandelion I AM TERRIFED. I AM SO SCARED OH BOY OKAY THIS IS EXCITING IM GONNA PEE
@soosramirez pRECIOUS.........
@Pandandelion SCREAMS I AM SO SCARED AND SO EXCITED
tfw you forget tambry's last name isn't canonically 'madan'

i can't do this one i've got to randomize again i'm too nervous
im into it 
'your muse pushing my muse to their knees' hahAHHA OKAY WOW ALRIGHT SWEATS HARD AND CLOSES EYES
i never expect anyone to send anything in when i reblog a risque meme
young starla is like the aftermath of a ke$ha song 
SO. MUCH. STARLA ART TODAY.
@AmandaPena13 my mother HAAAATTESSS that i painted my room lime green
@AmandaPena13 RIGHT UGH WHY ALL THE BORING EARTH TONES
GF ends and i move to oregon and build a shack and become grunkle stan and you're all invited
i always hated that my mom wanted to paint the house gray/beige/white/offwhite like who hurt you
the word adult makes me think of the color beige
'be an adult' lmao no
i take great comfort in knowing that if i am disappointed in myself today, in a year, i will not be this person
more about yourself and more about the world and more about just THINGS
who you are as a person is always in flux and who you are today is not the person you will be in a month because you are always learning
you ARE the sum of your experiences and your interests
some people i'm a loud, drinkin' party person, some people i'm a dweeby lil nerd
and depending on which IRL friend im associating with, i'm a different person
IRL friends don't get any of my fandom personality
but see like my personality changes depending on who im talking to anyway
@GRANDFIDDLE im probably going to have to go back to pretending to be an adult
theres already a handful of people who have moved on from gravity falls and it feels like they're very bored with me so i just.
everyone will be interested in other things and i'll just still be in the same place i was
tbh i dont fandom hop much anymore like all i care about is gravity falls so i'm terrified that everyone is going to move on w/out me
@GRANDFIDDLE !!! SAME HAT.....
@oscarpower the meme you sent got randomized to one i am VERY DELIGHTED/EMBARASSED by so this might take a while Im so sorry
@GRANDFIDDLE i get recomended carla a lot
i hunger
OH IM STREAMIN HELLBOY TONIGHT BTW THATS IMPORTANT @Pandandelion

@AmandaPena13 save the swine
church near me has a sign that said 'free yourself from sin to make room for-' and I thought it was gonna say more sin but nah it said god
and welcome to every waking moment of my life
'[cries just a little]'
'[screams into pillow for 14 seconds]'
'I haven't even gotten out of bed yet, I need to put on clothes and go before they close. I'm scared. I hate this. i have to go.'
'they're gonna look at me like I'm nuts they're gonna think I'm the stupidest person on the planet and I probably look weird too'
'how longs it gonna take? i don't want to do this. I have to do this. I have to go to the bank too. I'm gonna cry. you can't cry.'
'fuck what if it takes hours? they have to patch INSIDE the tire, what if I'm stuck sitting in the front room for hours?'
'then i just gotta go in and tell em there's a screw in my tire and I need to get a patch. I hope it doesn't cost a lot.'
'I'll just park near the back so they don't see me and think I'm a fucking moron.'
'okay okay, I googled a satellite view of the place, it's not so bad. it's not as bad as I remember. still, that's such a weird set up...'
'the street is busy, i hope I don't piss anyone off struggling to turn into the place- I'm probably going to piss someone off, oh god'
'okay, i have to go and get my tire fixed. from what I remember, the parking lot is small, and I can't remember how to pull in'
a look into the thought process of having to go to the auto shop to get a tire patched

LOOK AT HOW TINY THE OLD CARLA ICONS FOLDER IS 
@AmandaPena13 i don't even have an art folder i'm lucky if my carla art goes in the carla folder lmao

@nymbulxus i love you
@nymbulxus well she didnt do it on purpose but she was like PFFT HE BETTER NOT UNDERESTIMATE ME and then she just
@nymbulxus im watching naked and afraid this show is my favorite garbage
this girl: 'he probably picked p survival to impress people he better not try and impress me'
*immediately cuts own hand open w/ machete*
every guy on this show: 'she's a very attractive woman'
every girl on this show: 'i hope he's not a douche'
@nymbulxus BUT U KNO THE OTHERS WOULDN'T LET HIM GIVE UP just imagine her face when she REMEMBERS him......
@gloupti probably dead and just idk you'll probably know
@nymbulxus what if she has amnesia
@gloupti you'll know
i feel bad that ive only had motivation for stan threads on carla lately but its probably because im pmsing
@AmandaPena13 @nymbulxus i've been down there the longest
ME THO 
@AmandaPena13 @nymbulxus LITERALLY THO
@nymbulxus @AmandaPena13 [distantly, as if from very far far down] if you visit once you'll never leave
i love when the cam crews record big fat juice crabs that the survivors CLEARLY aren't being told about so they can eat them
@gloupti every area of new jersey you run the risking of finding a mob victim i don't play that game
@gloupti why would you want to try and survive in new jersey
if you had to be trapped in the wilderness somewhere where would you want to be trapped
@AmandaPena13 i kNOW i don't especially when the drama inevitably starts up like good lord
i do want to try gator meat someday but i'd probably have to go to florida for that
i was almost jealous of the guys who were in the everglades they were eating catfish and then the guy killed and ate a fucking gator
@AmandaPena13 they do intervene when shit goes really wrong, like when fernando ate the mushroom, but like... they HAVE TO JUST WATCH....
i love james k polk he's my favorite president
@AmandaPena13 that's got to be the weirdest job ever, it really does.
@AmandaPena13 it's not a GAME, amanda it's SURVIVAL
fernando i'm so mad at you right now
WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU
I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU
HE ATE A FUCKING MUSHROOM
COME ON FERNANDO DON'T EAT A MUSHROOM WHAT THE FUCK FERNANDO
@AmandaPena13 no but i still get NERVOUS
any time they eat a snake on this show im like god please don't accidentally poison yourselves
@AmandaPena13 GOD
i love when people get paired with vigorous optimists like yeah we're covered in leeches and it's pouring rain BUT LIFE IS AMAZINGGG
omg these guys are covered in leeches this show is gnarly
lmao i love alan he calls me a mad woman but he's in the same hell i am
oh im fully aware 
@GRANDFIDDLE 'pathetic'
'of course i feel bad for it' ur gonna still do it tho, ur gonna still do it.
'jamie is going to shoplift' and the camera crew is, of course, going to watch.
'we decided it was time to have a baby' at age 20??? 'that's when i snorted coke the first time' whaT
@soosody it's called 'Intervention' they show how a person got into drugs or smth and then they intervene
moving to the city and smoking weed made this boy steal a car
'we moved to the city and jamie was formally introduced to marijuana'
THIS INTERVENTION SHOW IS THE DUMBEST THING
@MaraWritesStuff 
i love watching survival shows with my mom and sister and criticizing the survivalists like we could do better
@AmandaPena13 @nymbulxus pretty much yeah. That's why I switched to single ship with stans cause... lmao go awayyyy
@nymbulxus carla and greg was kinda cute in theory but like.... ehhhhh.
@AmandaPena13 @nymbulxus right??? he's so sketchy and so skeezy I don't understand why people trust or like him.
@nymbulxus @AmandaPena13 yeah he's all around creepy. nnnnnooot a fan.
@nymbulxus uh. shippy things, not snippy thugs. gdi mobile.
@nymbulxus that's probably your best bet. :c he keeps messaging me snippy thugs on greg for carla.
@nymbulxus im probably going to start blocking him. blacklist and unfollow isn't enough. :(
@nymbulxus it's lit impossible to get rid of him completely it's awful
@GRANDFIDDLE B)
@GRANDFIDDLE u kno  
"No but I'm familiar with the concept of restaurants so I think I'll be ok."
@GRANDFIDDLE I NEED TO DOWNLOAD OP AND CATCH UP

OH MY GOD @GRANDFIDDLE 
all those vines of the plastic muscular men w/ YMCA playing in the background: the carla mccorkle aesthetic

pizza hut puts too much sauce on their pizza :C
@GRANDFIDDLE IM GONNA DO IT. IM GONNA KISS.
i want to kiss
wtf pacman is so cute
and neither me or her can tell if that's a good thing or not
day's gonna come where carla's gonna be able to look at vaz's stan and not feel anything at all
realizing something about your muse that breaks your heart 
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMABEL BABE-EL
I DONT KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT I REALLY LOVE ALL OF YOU SO MUCH

@GRANDFIDDLE FANS YOU
@JeansandaTShirt SAME. if youve got any tips on how i could get started? idk i'd rly appreciate it if ya got any thoughts to toss my way.
@JeansandaTShirt that's one of the big reasons i want to learn, TBH. there's a lot of things i want to punch.
@JeansandaTShirt god i wouldn't even know how to start though. i really really would love to.
and tbh lbr i'm fat and self conscious so lmao i would be the worst student
@JeansandaTShirt i've always wanted to take boxing lessons, but i've never had the money :(
GOD I LOVE BOXING I WISH I WAS MORE AWARE OF IT I WANT TO BE INCLUDED
@leghaus ooh. well i kept seeing stuff like 'it's supposed to last til six am' and i was like wat but i guess that's just coverage

I WISH I COULD WATCH THIS
@soosramirez tru @leghaus tru
@grieverwings B))))))

@leghaus WHOA THERE
'ive a basic inclination, a very primal need' FERNGULLY WHAT RE YOU DOING
that song is about eating out okay get off my back
THIS SONG 
if im gonna eat somebody, might as well be you B)))))
THAT ONE LIZARD? YOU KNOW THE ONE
ALSO THAT LIZARD
TIM CURRY AS LITERAL POLLUTION WAS A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME
POOOOIIIISON SLIIIIME- AAAAACIIIDDD RAAIINNNN
DID SOMEBODY SAY FERNGULLY
@GRANDFIDDLE OH. WELL. I'M GLAD HE'S HAVING FUN.
is manny winning tho i cant watch the fight but i want to know things are going well
all ive been listening to is ke$ha why do party club glitter pop work so well for starla
does this character vibe like a used car salesman that doesn't get personal space? i'm probably into that
@leghaus make a deal for the d
[thinks about james woods hades] why am i attracted to the greasy lawyer trope
a bugs life literally had one of the best voice casts of all time, that entire cast was beautiful and brilliant.
@vz132 IT'S THAT KEVIN SPACEY VOICE OKAY IT'S JUST SO GOOD
@vz132 i mean same tho
@vz132 MMM. MMMMM. GASTON. MMM.
@soosramirez i have disappointed you. i am shamed.
@soosramirez ive actually only seen parts of up never the whole thing
@soosramirez who
and everyone knows the most bangable disney villain is hades
@AmandaPena13 well megamind's a GIVEN
mm....MM. 
no wait i totally had a thing for the colonel from spirit
... i can't think of a dreamworks villain im attracted to.
my twitter feed is a mess right now idk what is happening
important thing- mabel being like four inches taller than dipper when they're adults
OKAY I MEANT TO SHOWER LIKE AN H O U R AGO BBIAB
TBQH 'Stan o' War' was probably his boxing name.
'pfft, whatever stan o' war'
stan slowly turns around, looking like he has reached nirvana. yes. YES. HE IS. THE STAN O' WAR.
'uncle stan you wouldn't have anything to do with mabel joining the kickboxing team would you?'
[choking back tears] 'sh-she did what?'
@soosramirez !!!! !! ! WTF !! YEAH!! EYAHHH!!! YEAHH!!!! WTF YEAH
she does become the best wrestler in school and she's like 'IT'S LIKE VIOLENT HUGGING'
mabel thinks about trying out for the boxing team in high school but it ends up not really being her thing- HOWEVER
@AmandaPena13 CLOSES EYES GOD I LOVE.... THIS IDIOT CALLS HIMSELF THE STAN O' WAR......
@soosramirez sAME??? wtf mabel taking after stan wounds me in the best way
i want mabel to grow up to be a really foulmouthed comedian and when stan goes to her shows he just tears up with joy he taught her so well
@soosramirez oh my goD
My Cousin Vinny but w/ Stanford Pines.
the ultimate irony is stan the man would have been the world's best defense attorney lmao.
@soosramirez @AmandaPena13 he IS a big goofy idiot but i just wish people wouldn't forget the slick lawyer side of him.
@AmandaPena13 UGH I FEEL IT. the way the fandom treats stan like a big dumb meathead is an anguish i feel deep in my bone marrow
@soosramirez i fucking love tyler he's so cute i want a pullstring toy of him that says 'GET IM, GET IM'
she probably looked like a buff julianne moore
i still really want to see what mrs. corduroy was like for her to have married and had multiple children with lumberjack dad
suddenly want to RP manly dan
manly dan flirting would just be loud sweating and him screaming smth like 'SO DO YOU WANNA GO PUNCH OUR NAMES INTO A TREE'
@GRANDFIDDLE very wrong
@GRANDFIDDLE he thinks dan is smooth and can make people swoon
@GRANDFIDDLE 'well that's a really big stretch and seems deeply OOC for big shouty lumberjack dad'
@GRANDFIDDLE idk i used to follow them b4 i realized how awful they were and they would always say stuff about dan that i'd be like +
i should write rly cute manly dan stuff that deliberately goes against all their shitty headcanons yes i AM that petty
@AmandaPena13 @soosramirez honestly? they send asks to popular artists CONSTANTLY hounding for manly dan stuff. + their posts get reblogged.
@soosramirez i only pray to god i'm not this annoying about carla mccorkle and if i ever am, please shut me the fuck up
do you know how HARD it is for a person to ruin lumberjack dad for me
@soosramirez it really does. i love manly dan as a character but every time they talk about dan i'm like 'wow i fucking hate manly dan'.
@AmandaPena13 @GRANDFIDDLE IM GONNA DRAW SO MUCH MABEL SO MUCH
dear dil/fiisms- nobody cares
@GRANDFIDDLE @AmandaPena13 ew. but also- MAYBEL YES PLS
@GRANDFIDDLE 'YOU OWE ME 30 YEARS WORTH OF DATE NIGHTS, STAN PINES, YOU CAN'T WEASEL OUT OF THIS DEBT'
this is the best piece of RP i've ever written 
stan: 'you should go and live you're life, it's all i want for you'
carla: 'hold the fuCK UP'
GOD have you ever finished an RP reply and felt like you ran a mile
angsts quietly about pizza
@Pandandelion i'm on my period and almost cried because i couldn't get the chocolate lava cake things that i got when i was at ur place

manny just looks like a happier person than floyd
@spinningsea aw man. fuck that guy. who's the other dude? manny? FUCK HIM UP, MANNY
so wait from what i'm gathering- the world wants to see this mayweather dude get his butt kicked? i think? i'm not fast tonight.
pizza hut email confirmation said 'your order will be delivered on may 2nd at 8:20pm' and i thought what that's TOMORROW
a good example of the day i'm having
i feel like im missing out on an event of some sort
is pizza hut pasta any good
@LovelyLadyLomps i have potato bread, kraft singles, and prego pasta sauce. i don't want to make my own pizza.
PIZZA HUT HAS ONLINE DELIVERY I'M SAVED
@AmandaPena13 if they dont im going to have to subsist on potato chips tonight and i dont want to do that
does pizza hut deliver via the internet
what am i supposed to do for food now
i'm legitimately heartbroken about this 
... okay. 
i hope the candy bucket has something good- 
I have GOT to get my lip waxed I look like that lonely island Creep video w/ nicki minaj 
four minutes til I gotta go back out there 
@GRANDFIDDLE illegal
my coworker is talking to me and I Do Not Care
@GRANDFIDDLE oh my god beautiful geek

unrelated i quite love being called tintin and tin
@vz132 yes you did Stan you big stupid bastard she doesnt WANT to live what's left of her life without you
'please dont leave me again.'
she just said she doesnt want him out of her life and he's still trying to
THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT HIM

i just want old stan and carla to sleep in the same bed together nothing nsfw i just want quiet old people cuddles
we put our faith in hirsch hardcheese
@PHUZface and thank god for it- no matter what happens, we will all be told to sit the fuck down.
@GRANDFIDDLE tear martini
[rolls around in pictures of stan as a father] leave me in the garbage where i belong
i want it but i also but i kind of but i DO but then there's also
i both do and dont want g4g to be true i'm so conflicted
@vz132 sAME? hell i still do that. or i just keep google open so nobody knows that i'm dumb
JUST THE IRONY
a literal angel hitting on stan pines=me laughing 4ever
@vz132 it's one of the choirs of angels in biblical mythology. basically a high-ranking angel of god.
it just gives me flashbacks to neopets and myspace rp okay
@vz132 yeah there's a seraphim OC that hits on stan blogs that does that and it IRKS ME SO MUCH
when people RP with asterisks 
so basically fuck you first husband, it was YOUR fault, not my moms
+ and he blamed HER for that. but then she married my dad and got pregnant REALLY FAST.
i always get a significant degree of joy in the fact that my mom struggled for years to have a baby with her first husband +
THEIR**
my mom was 37ish when she had me and my dad was 47 so i was always like 'ur parents are in ur forties??? weird'
i was always so confused when my peers had young parents it was always so weird to me
@GRANDFIDDLE i will let u
@vz132 lauGHS IT'S OKAY
they're basically 'Married, With Children'
stan and carla are my shitty tacky 70s couple with too much chest hair and dangly plastic jewelry
@vz132 he asked at dinner one night.
@vz132 once i had to explain to my 65 year old father what the kama sutra was
'picked you up something nice' and she hands stan the gaudiest gold medallion she could find
carla picking up rich men and ditching out their backdoor with pockets full of cash and gold watches
criminal couple Carla and Stan
@vz132 'i'll be right back, i'm just gonna freshen up' and she jumps out the bathroom window to hop in the passenger seat of stan's car
@Pandandelion iT'S A SUITCASE FULL OF HUNDREDS
@GRANDFIDDLE unspecified, but it's a suitcase filled with 100s, so. i don't feel like doing the math on that. a lot.
the question is would stan be okay with carla sleeping with someone else for a significant sum of money
@vz132 they offered her a suitcase full of hundreds and at that point i'm sure even stan would sleep with 'em
this anon really wants to sleep with carla
stop carla mccorkle 2k15 
@SweetMcGurran tru
[reblogs a question meme on carla][immediately asked about prostitution prices]
does anyone else get a mad case of itchy boob when theyre on their period im asking for science
alright im gonna brave the arctic fuckin tundra that is my house and take a shower
@GRANDFIDDLE goOD
@GRANDFIDDLE i meant to tell u i keep picturing penguins with bunk beds
WARLOCK LEY...... YE.....

whEEZES HE SUGGESTED CARLA BE THERE WHEN HE BROUGHT HIS BROTHER BACK WOW I
listen uterus i didnt ask for this
@ninjasexparty something not going to be up at all if you keep that up- but i guess that's the point
my mom loves nicki minaj and she blasts the radio at every opportunity
carla's probably like my mom to a degree
waits quietly for a new ke$ha album
at least i wont be on my period when i go to the graduation party
@GRANDFIDDLE I'M OKAY WITH THAT
'i duMPED YOU WHY ARE YOU BEING SO NICE TO ME'

talking about romance? i wasn't invited to this table, but i'm sitting at it nOW LET'S TALK ABOUT SHIT
he's just like me
'I HEARD YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT QUADRANTS, SO I DECIDED TO PAUSE MY TANTRUM' you are an incredibly large, alien love nerd
sometimes i think i'm over homestuck and then karkat flings himself into a convo he wasn't a part of because they were talking about romance
@AmandaPena13 @soosramirez @GRANDFIDDLE @ghostbumblebee yeah, you don't shove someone in a sack with all your stuff unless you love them
shrek the musical is a legitimately good musical and brian d'arcy james has amazing eyebrows

@GRANDFIDDLE DO IT DO IT DO IT THIS IS THE TEMPTATION SPEAKING
GIF OF SMITHERS FROM THE SIMPSONS CRINGING AWAY FROM THE STRIPPERS
WHERE'S THAT
@GRANDFIDDLE @vz132  OKAY BUT IMAGINE STAN'S STAG PARTY
stan's a great dad because he already had plenty of experience with his adult twin brother
@GRANDFIDDLE it's literally like trying to wrangle a toddler
@GRANDFIDDLE I'LL TIE THE DAMN TIE JUST HOLD YER ASS STILL

@GRANDFIDDLE STAN SHOVING LEY INTO A TUX

stan and carla would have had the chillest wedding
what are you trying to accomplish 
nerd cat 
@AmandaPena13 i constantly feel like i dodged a bullet irt my name
STAN'S FA C E WHEN HE SEES HER WOW IM GONNA LAY DOWN
WTF..... WTF.... ILLEGAL..... WTF
CARLA IN A WEDDING DRESS???????
YODELS EXCESSIVELY 
@AmandaPena13 I think White was removed because the rest of my family said 'Dan, we aren't naming the baby the absence of color'
and my aunt alice said 'don't you fucking dare' so they were like 'ALISON?' 'that is acceptable' and here i am today
So everyone in the hospital room was like 'shit shit what do we call her' and they were like 'ALICE, LET'S NAME HER AFTER YOU'
I was gonna be Thomas, then my dad wanted to name me White, and then I was a girl and I fucked up everybody's plans.
@AmandaPena13 + coming back. so my fam kind of ASSUMED and IDK the logic seemed sound at the time i guess.
@AmandaPena13 well we have this sort of thing in my fam where apparently- the next baby born in the family is the last person who died +
@AmandaPena13 it was the 90s, shoulderpads were fashionable. logic didn't exist and boybands ruled the earth.
@AmandaPena13 The assumption/logic that because my mother had already birthed a girl, it must be time for a boy.
@AmandaPena13 Oh my parents didn't check, they just assumed. They were CONVINCED.
On purpose? 
'White Farrell' can you even imagine
There was a mad dash to come up with a name that was 'Thomas' or 'White' because my dad thought it would be cool to name me 'White'.
Lo and behold I popped out the incorrect gender AND a month early.
My maternal grandpa died literal months before I was born and everybody thought I was going to be a boy.
I didn't know either of my grandfathers. My mom thinks I'm the reincarnation of her father, though.
THIS IS HOW MUCH STAN MEANS TO ME??
I JUST MEAN LIKE
@GRANDFIDDLE NO i'M OKAY I PROMISE
i miss my daddy every day of my life i don't think i could handle it if stan dies
i love that gravity falls kind of gave me an image of my father back
i really am tearing up like god i hate this
@GRANDFIDDLE I CAN'T I CAN'T I'M CRYING THINKING ABOUT IT I REALLY AM
@GRANDFIDDLE HELLO
I CAN'T BURY CARTOON DAD
lmao i'm too invested in stan because he is my father i CAN'T WATCH ANOTHER DAD DIE, YOU GUYS
i have that shitty thought of 'i can't watch my cartoon dad die'
like i literally feel my heart CLENCH when people say stan is going to die
literally anyone else i don't care protect stan pines
please i would rather anyone else die than stan
@GRANDFIDDLE worst. old people. ever.
carla's gonna bake soos so many cakes and give him a bunch of hugs
@GRANDFIDDLE IM NEVER GONNA GET OVER CARLA PINES SMFH
@GRANDFIDDLE @AmandaPena13 also hey soos, i'm glad you're safe ya big lug &lt;3
@GRANDFIDDLE GOOD. ALSO BY THE WAY. [SLAP+KISS] DON'T EVER SCARE ME LIKE THAT AGAIN JEEEEEZUS CHRISTMAS OLD MAN GIVIN ME A HEART ATTACK
@GRANDFIDDLE WELL. ID RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT THAT, SEEING AS YOU KNOW. WE'RE BOTH ALIVE. AND WE'LL STAY ALIVE LONGER TOGETHER, I THINK.
@GRANDFIDDLE OF COURSE I SHOULDNT HAVE TO. but i'd be pretty upset if you died, so. deal with it.
@GRANDFIDDLE WELL I... I WASN'T ABOUT TO LET YOU GET KILLED, WAS I? WHEN THINGS GO TO HELL IN THIS TOWN, UR USUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT SO..
@GRANDFIDDLE of...??? of COURSE IT'S ME? you think i went the rest of my life after we broke up letting other people save me????
@GRANDFIDDLE what? wait for what? there might be more around-
SCR EAMS A LOT AMANDA&gt;..................... 
@GRANDFIDDLE ADIOS, FUCKO. stan are you okay?
@GRANDFIDDLE new skype name incoming
@GRANDFIDDLE JUST PULLS HIM OUT OF THE WAY OF A MONSTER OR SMTH, KICKS THE BEAST INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
idc how, i just want the tables to turn.
i want carla to rescue stan
great things: when you put a blanket on your cat like they're in bed and they stay beneath the blanket
it is my eternal goal for carla to hug every stan, regardless of what happens with the two of them
the calendar says may but i swear to fuck it feels like january
I work tomorrow and Saturday night so I probably wouldn't stream those days anyway- MONDAY NIGHT HELLBOY
@soosody I don't work on Monday! I can wait til then :&gt;
@soosody D: when will u return?
sometime this weekend i'm going to stream hellboy and hellboy 2 because i need that sweet sweet demon/human action adventure comedy romance
the grunk abides 
put your orbs away, boy 
@LovelyLadyLomps i'm from new jersey. i might not exist at all, tbqh.
@AmandaPena13 @soosody you... you EAT IT? my mother always just slathered it on my chest and told me to breathe deep.
'it's definitely ice cream weather' i mutter in the overcast, 45 degree with wind chill evening air
PLEASE LISTEN TO MY CAT SNORING 
@AmandaPena13 i probably will. greg/carla is cute in theory but i'm single ship and also they are awful. just awful.
@AmandaPena13 [squints] i cant see shit
@AmandaPena13 they sent me another shippy meme on their greg universe and im like pls end this
they made it very obvious they didn't want me or carla around.
there's a lot of stans who have never followed me back or made it clear they want no shipping, so i've unfollowed and backed away cause uh
it's not that i'm steering clear because they won't ship, it's because i don't want them to think i'm going to force it on anyone
it's why i leave alone any stan that doesn't show any interest in carla
especially for younger versions of a character it's like- you don't want to care about that character, you just want to bang them
the only thing they have in common, is a third party's desire to see them touch tongues
but it reaches a point where shipping is the only chemistry two characters have, if that makes sense
of couRSE i want to rp shippy stuff i'd be a filthy rotten liar if i said anything otherwise
you might have noticed that i like shipping
you guys know me pretty well by now
@nymbulxus it's understandable. and like.
@nymbulxus god i hate that. i have so many RP pet peeves why do i love it so much goD
@nymbulxus ew
[sweats nervously at nsfw rps]
i've secondhand funkled the grunkle, technically
@AmandaPena13 @nymbulxus im a committed person
i want to go get ice cream but my bed is sooooo comfy
@soosramirez YOU MADE ME SNORT
i draw carla a lot but im scared to post any of it
[opens up the Gravity Falls fandom's lid] draw more carla mccorkle [closes the lid]
i have about five, almost six, completely separate bios written for carla because her character spans a literal lifetime
@AmandaPena13 + and modern day. and nobody's the same at 16 or 25 that they are at 70.
@AmandaPena13 + carla? i had to sit down and do a character chart for THREE stages of life because i knew i would end up RPing flashbacks +
@AmandaPena13 i guess i have less trouble with it cause i find it fun to explore who a person is at dif stages of life, like +
than it is to play a 16 year old who has tingly feelings in their belly for a being of otherworldly horror with no empathy.
in my experience it's way more delightful to play that cocktail of middle school angst and hormones coupled with the supernatural.
@AmandaPena13 + I rped with a teen dipper, purely because they're, you know, TWINS.
@AmandaPena13 i don't mind aged up but it gets so TIRESOME when that's all there is. my mabel was only ever a teen when +
'oh a bill- he's human and has elf ears for some reason and he, too, wants to make out with 90% of the pines family'
@AmandaPena13 'oh a dipper- it's aged up AU and they want to kiss bill' 'oh a mabel- they want to make out with their own brother' 'oh a-'
@GRANDFIDDLE not enough good ones though
i mean it's -stan- you'd think there'd be a million stan RP blogs
it's so bizarre to me that there are so few stans
@AmandaPena13 i do feel bad that i keep flaking so hard on my stan blog i want to play stan but i just am too convinced i suck at stan lmao
@AmandaPena13 MINOR CHARACTER HELL MINOR CHARACTER HELL
@AmandaPena13 with every belch, i fall further and further in love
@AmandaPena13 im thinking a spring wedding
@AmandaPena13 he did talk about his ass shaving habits in a recent video so i'd say he probably  has the manpelt i desire.
i'm a goddamn masochist i can't watch shows like this and not feel exceedingly jealous
no no no i can't do this sudden pain in knowing that i'm not working in the entertainment industry right now
the coloring of this show is absolutely gorgeous, and not at all what i expected.
Mrs. Alison Nelson has a beautiful ring to it
i'm going to marry foggy
I'M STILL UPSET
IT'S BEEN YEARS
or maybe she hocked them i don't know THE POINT IS
TWO SHINES
I WAS TWO SHINES AWAY FROM BEATING SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE AND MY SISTER TOOK MY GAMECUBE + GAMES AND THEY GOT STOLEN
i mean the acting is very good but for just coming into the show? offbeat and kinda clunky.
i started daredevil and i gotta say this is a very bizarre, uncomfortable way to start a series
god i love downrightnow  
@GRANDFIDDLE i will begin doing so
@GRANDFIDDLE mcg as a drummer- 'these are my fiddle sticks'
has fiddleford ever said the word 'fiddlesticks'
it's not exactly cold outside  but it's very windy and i'm not about that life
i want to marry cr1tikal
@Pandandelion we have to get matching hats
@Pandandelion when i move in we can do stuff together tho so it doesn't have to be such a stressful experience buying hot dog buns
@Pandandelion SAME HAT
@Pandandelion ME?? SAME SAME GOD I HATE. SAME.
@Pandandelion ORE MONOGATARI
'it's anxiety-inducing to go alone, take this' [a new friend holds my hand while i go to the store]
i just need a personal outing companion like someone who will go places with me so that i have a safety blanket of company with me
i been sneezing all day my throat feels so raw
@GRANDFIDDLE why would you want to tho
@GRANDFIDDLE closes eyes
well mall closes at 9:30 it's not like i don't have time- plus if i go later it won't be as packed and i won't be as anxious
I NEEDTO GO TO THE MALL well i don't need to but i've been saying i'm gonna go to the mall for like a month
I KEEP HAVING TO PAUSE THIS I'M SMILIN SO HARD

@leghaus closes eyes THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR SO LONG THANK U FRIEND

wtf wt f f wt F I S ANIME

i overcooked my chicken but if you think i'm not going to gnaw my way through this then you've got another thing coming bucko
uggh why is it so hard just to psyche myself up to go to the mall
me usually: eh, im not super into anime.
me watching an anime: IM THE WEEBIEST GARBAGE OF ALLLL TIIIIIMMMEEE
@GRANDFIDDLE oh my god yes. i bet he does great duck calls.
@GRANDFIDDLE :3c
i still hate vriska
i opened the window for five minutes and was incapacitated with sneezing for ten
@GRANDFIDDLE 
i love...chest hair,,,,
@vz132 i have reread it about four times today i'm in so deep, vaz
[rereads the thread with vaz] there is a god and he cares about me
i'm so happy that i can indulge in that now and there are folks who are into it with me
it wasn't because of any theory, it's just because i fucking love kids and i love when my otps reproduce
but all my partners at the time were like 'PFF stan would NEVER have children'
back before carla and starla and g4g got big i would quietly attempt to go 'hey so what if they had KIDS' into RP convos
+ carla's like 'well what would you have wanted your pop to be like for you?' and stan's like 'oh.'
carla reminding him that he's not his pop. and when he wonders how he can possibly be a dad with nothing HE likes to go from +
stan being terrifed of being a father because he never had the best relationship with his own dad. he's so scared they'll hate him.
@vz132 I WANT STAN AND CARLA TO HAVE A GIRL SO BAD........................
@vz132 me screaming
of course he does, what are you nuts? kiss me better, carla mccorkle
stan burning his mouth so carla's like 'aww you want me to kiss it better?'
@vz132 carla's laughing and she passes him some ice cream cause you can't have apple pie without vanilla ice cream
@vz132 he'd just pull her in for a big hug like 'ur my favorite lady' 'you gotta wait til it's cool' 'nnnnooo i want it now'
stan coming home and carla's got a big ol' apple pie in the oven
@vz132 I LOVE
im sorry im just very sad all the time
lays down and cRIES A LOT
SHE PROBABLY HAD TO LISTEN TO AUTHOR!STAN BABBLING ON AND ON ABOUT THE PARANORMAL SHE WAS T H E R E FOR IT
SHE MET THE STAN TWINS WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER PLEA SE  COME ON U GUYS
PLUS COME ON THERE'S NO WAY CARLA WASN'T INVOLVED IN SUPERNATURAL STUFF COME ON
@SadAnimatedBoys billdip is trash and it's not even good trash it's wet garbage trash
if g4g is true, then i believe the actual breakup/divorce was a lot more complicated than just carla kicking stan out or stan faking dead.
he had an emotional reaction to dipper's plight, he was trying to retroactively fix something he couldn't fix in the past, i think.
i said it earlier but like there's no way stan pulled hypnotism out of thin air for a lie after saying paranormal didn't exist.
another thing that trips me up with g4g, like.
@vz132 welcome to hell welcome to hell
please always talk to me about stan having a baby it's what fuels me
@vz132 I wasn't personally invested in the show at the time, I got into it around a month or two before season 2 started, but. IDK bruh. IDK
@vz132 Yep.
+ g4g plot with carla arriving like hell on wheels. 'WHERE IS HE. WHERE IS THAT LYING, NO GOOD, DIRTY ROTTEN...' 'kids, save me.'
+ how mcg appears to be getting, and what i assume stan and his twin will get. also, i can absolutely see hirsch ending a potential +
+ his 'ex wife' comments make sense because a dead man can't be married. and that leaves it open for a later sort of redemption arc like +
if g4g is true, i think it would be more in vein with the themes of the show if stan faked his death but was still married +
but he couldn't, cause lazy susan looks weird up close.
'it would be NICE if she liked me' maybe the words of a guy who after 30 years, thought he should try and move on?
as for abuelita and susan? abuelita was pretty spur of the moment. and stan never claims to want anything serious with susan.
i mean i know hirsch pushes the envelope but crime to divorce to faking your death seems like a pretty steep and Too Real slope.
@vz132 i think so??? the theory is pretty convoluted sometimes and a little too heavy for what i think a kids show would go for.
but i don't think stan started getting in trouble with the law until AFTER his brother disappeared.
it appears to be said that they got divorced because stan was getting arrested/in trouble with the law.
that's where grunkle2grandpa gets me too, like.
@vz132 i think it's suggested that they got divorced?
@vz132 i talked to somebody once who said stan cheated on carla a lot and i was  SO MAD ON STAN'S BEHALF
@vz132 i haaaate the cheating trope. i see it get done SO MUCH for stan cheating on carla or fids cheating on his wife l ike uGH.
@vz132 HELLA
im prob gonna finish writing this tragedy of a fic and then go to bed since RP is dead and everyone is goin sleepies looks like.
@AmandaPena13 I hate when people split up dip and mabel and make dipper all EDGY. YOUR TROPES ARE BORING AND YOUR CONCEPTS ARE OVERPLAYED.
bipper made everything terrible
@AmandaPena13 the first part of that is cool, but i HATE that second part.
get this billdip garbage out of my life
i hate the transcendence au i have no idea what it's about but i know it irks me
@AmandaPena13 i... tbh i can't remember.
thinks about how good stan could rock a baby to sleep w/ those big ol arms of his
@AmandaPena13 from three floors down?
also i love the idea that stan saw dipper sleeping outside w/ the periscope and was like 'oh my god.....'
you'rE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LOGICAL TWIN
also there's a fucking couch on the porch, dipper, you didn't need to sleep beneath the totem pole
@GRANDFIDDLE honestly like dip just have a campout in the living room if you're that strapped for space
[shuffles papers everywhere] WHAT IS THE MYSTERY SHACK'S LAYOUT
it boggles my mind that there was apparently no other room for dipper to sleep in during carpet diem the shack is HUGE it has plenty of room
stan's room and a bathroom and the hidden room w/ the wax figures?? and a staircase?? maybe? wha t
but what the fuck is going on with that middle floor
and we know what the attic/third floor looks like
the thing that drives me nuts about the shack is, we kind of roughly know what the bottom floor looks like
@GRANDFIDDLE I WANT DETAILED BLUEPRINTS AND A SOLIDLY CONFIRMED LAYOUT OF ALL FLOORS
tho lbr the shack's layout makes zero sense so
can i build the shack in sims???? i'm so bad at making multi-story houses
u kno when ur in so deep ur making ur otps in sims 2 yeah thats me
opens up sims 3
...
@GRANDFIDDLE he has you in his noodly clutches
some people drink, others do drugs, some are adrenaline junkies. whatever it takes to get that rush, that freedom. for me? SUGAR CRUSH.
@GRANDFIDDLE [points] cuTE DAVID
i'm a menace to society
i can't count on my hands anymore

I'M SO ANGRY AND ATTRACTED TO THESE IDIOT MEN 
@GRANDFIDDLE KOWALSKI AND DIPPER.
mabel and private
@GRANDFIDDLE pen i need you to listen very carefully to the next tweet i'm about to make

@GRANDFIDDLE IT RLY WOULDN'T LMAO
@GRANDFIDDLE :D
@GRANDFIDDLE octohugs
@GRANDFIDDLE CARLA AND DAVE
@GRANDFIDDLE i'm fucking rEADY
@GRANDFIDDLE gasps in shock
my time in NYC was a mess
so i couldn't say anything to him that time either
and then i saw him AGAIN leaving the subway once but i was in tears because i walked in on my room mate having sex
wearing my NYFA hoodie and taking notes in a book on auditioning and i didn't say anything to paul goddamn giamatti
remember that time i sat next to paul giamatti on the subway for ten minutes and didn't -say- anything to him
@GRANDFIDDLE he's shaven in 'An Education' and in Raiders of the Lost Ark but he's covered in dirt in raiders.
@GRANDFIDDLE I'LL SKIM HIS IMDB
@GRANDFIDDLE I FEEL THIS
@leghaus @GRANDFIDDLE that's illegal
@leghaus @GRANDFIDDLE jesus christ you ever just forget how hot someone is and then you remember and you're like pelase god take me now im r
i wonder if those molina!ock fics i loved are still on 
@GRANDFIDDLE sWEATS NERVOUSLY BECAUSE I KNO. UR FEELINGS.
annnnd all the stan RPers have gone to bed for the night. WELP. that was all i had the motivation for tonight.
same tho
@GRANDFIDDLE OH HOHOHOHOHOHOHO &gt;:))))))))
@GRANDFIDDLE i. are you angry with me or. i. im sorry.
@GRANDFIDDLE i always think of alfred molina because he played doctor octopus in the spiderman flicks
'alison what's your taste in men?' 
@SweetMcGurran buT REALLY THO unbutton a couple more of those i meanifyouwantsir
stan pines has been showing off too much chest hair since the moment he was able to
@vz132 i'm proud of you
everyone needs to watch Batteries Not Included it's basically 'small robot friend' the movie
frantically does RP replies before person goes to bed
@AmandaPena13 even tarantulas! fuzzy critters of all shapes and sizes!
[gets to touch literally any furry animal] this is what joy is
oh thank christ im not the only one closing with her on friday
[rereads  mine and vaz's thread] i love dying and being dead
sometimes i see pictures and i'm like 'thats it, that's carla' 
but who is VP? skipper? could he handle being second in command?
old man cat snoring 
private for president 2k16 pls
imagine kowalski TEACHING a college class
@GRANDFIDDLE skipper dabbing at tears, rico WAILING LOUDLY as he gets his diploma
private graduating imagine this penguin in a graduation gown and cap w/ three other penguins honking in the front row
giving private a smooch on the cheek or the top of his head, species depending.
@GRANDFIDDLE you give him a big hug back and tell him you're really glad he had a gr8 time. and you'll see him in class on monday.
@GRANDFIDDLE private getting back to the others later and just GUSHING about how FUN the party was
@GRANDFIDDLE you tell him to just be himself, if they don't like him, well then that's their loss.
@GRANDFIDDLE + drink, bu for the most part, it's not TOO crazy. private joins the mario kart gang and you help him figureo ut the buttons.
@GRANDFIDDLE maybe just a casual party. there's a mixture of students, some folks are playing mario kart. it's getting rowdy the more they+
@GRANDFIDDLE private wearing a clip on bowtie
a classy little seafood place, he needs to use a booster seat and talk with a speak and spell. the waitstaff decide not to comment.
i still think this would be better if you went on a 'date' with a literal penguin
imagine being the designated driver for a penguin turned human
@GRANDFIDDLE you tell him to just relax and maybe be careful with the alcohol. you promise to makes sure he gets home safe.
private getting invited to a college party
@GRANDFIDDLE you say you figured as much, but you hope one day he stops leering at you over the coffee table.
one day rico spits up a candy necklace into your lap. you're not sure if it's a token of friendship or not. you thank him anyway.
every time you visit the penguin's place you bring some fresh fish from the market. the one called skipper doesn't trust you, you can tell.
@GRANDFIDDLE he's the only human one tho, any time you go to his apartment, the others are still penguins.
@GRANDFIDDLE human private not quite having the hang of the volume of his voice yet 'HELLO' he screeches. 'it's nice to see you again'
@leghaus @GRANDFIDDLE they don't need to hand him to science, that class is only one building over
@GRANDFIDDLE THEY ALL SEEM SURPRISED TO SEE YOU. THERE'S A HUDDLE WITH YOUR CLASSMATE. AFTER SOME DELIBERATION, THEY OFFER YOU CHEETOS.
@leghaus @GRANDFIDDLE and ruin the image of a penguin hurrying to his next class?
@GRANDFIDDLE YES APARTMENT PENGUINS
@GRANDFIDDLE private in a dorm tho.
@GRANDFIDDLE the penguin becomes your study buddy.
@GRANDFIDDLE the teacher doesn't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary, and tells the penguin 'good work'.
@GRANDFIDDLE you watch him raise his flipper to answer a question. he taps the speak and spell- 'habeas corpus' it says. the correct answer.
@AmandaPena13 rico's mouth serves as a pencil sharpener
imagine walking into your first college class and there's a penguin in a booster seat next to you taking notes in a three ring binder
@GRANDFIDDLE @soosody that pengwing's got big dreams
'i notice you' fuCK MY ASS 
MARY POPPING OOH I LOVE MARY POPPINS I COULD EAT MARY POPPINS
I'M GONNA DIIIIE 
DO YOU EVER JUST REMEMBER HOW GOOD JAMES NESBITT WAS IN JEKYLL
im done playing candy crush. im a liar.

@GRANDFIDDLE ew???? i hate that
someone said in SU AU that stan and carla would be the equiv of garnet???? im crying??? ? ??
@QueenofEden i had to google 'iirc' the other day too i'm not hip to today's lingo
[sweats nervously and finally googles what 'IRT' stands for]
stan's not much for crying but... ikea furniture sure does bring the tears.
@GRANDFIDDLE sAVE HIM OH MY GOD
'why don't you take a break-' 'IT'S A MATTER OF PRIDE, CARLA'
@GRANDFIDDLE SO MUCH SWEARING COMING FROM THE OTHER ROOM
ikea shopping with stan and carla
thinks about stan struggling to put a crib together
god like i only have motivation for stan and carla threads right now for some reason u g h
every time i watch the juke joint scene i scan for wedding rings
@Pandandelion let's get on skype call and make loud irritating noises
@AmandaPena13 yeah except the genes get carried down into the offspring. also it's economy isn't a WRECK like neopets haha
[thinks about Dad!Stan] [makes weak noises] im fiNE
@AmandaPena13 kinda yeah. except it's dragons and you can breed the dragons and give them dif genes to make them prettier.
@Pandandelion  I'm gonna breed Dex and Wyn, because Lazuli and the one @GRANDFIDDLE just gave me make CUTE BBIES 
@GRANDFIDDLE i will take the shitter
@grandfiddle what do you want for it? :U
@GRANDFIDDLE YEAH ABSOLUTELT IT'S A CUTIE PATOOT WOW
I WANT DAD STANNNNNN
DAD STAN
@GRANDFIDDLE oKAY OMG CUTE.....
@vz132 over a white shirt. almost like he's hiding his past EEHEHHEHEHEE
L E T  M E  D I E  
@GRANDFIDDLE carla and stanley both hugging thompson at the same time
carla hugging thompson
WHO SHOULD I BREED OR SHOULD I WAIT 3 DAYS FOR TWILL AND DEXTER 
@GRANDFIDDLE CARLA JUST NUDGES HIS SHOULDER LIKE 'hey don't sell yourself short... you've got a talent, bucko. ;D'
@GRANDFIDDLE 'baking's a rough science, but this is the best chocolate ganache i've had in years'
@GRANDFIDDLE carla and thompson baking together and she just 'you're really good at this, kiddo'
STILL THREE DAYS BEFORE I CAN BREED WITH TWILL AND DEXTER UGH
and maybe drag stan out there with her cause carla will force that man to let loose if it's thE LAST THING SHE DOES
that's why she needs to go to GF so she can be 70 years old and running around barefoot and jumping in puddles
carla grew up in the big city she never got to feel grass between her toes as much as she needed to though
so she grew up surrounded by flowers and fresh greens and she used to stand barefoot on the wet concrete in the local greenhouse
i actually hc that carla's mom worked in/owned a flower shop
@GRANDFIDDLE i love thompson he is my thomp son
all her cakes, all her pies, there's something floral garnished on it she cannot help it
carla probably decorates everything she bakes with flowers
screamin bout this still don't know how I feel 
@GRANDFIDDLE FOR REAL JUST. carla will have him over for baked goods and hang outs and he can patiently teach stanley how 2 use the intraweb
@GRANDFIDDLE YES?? SURROGATE GRANDPARENTS 4 THOMPSON
i still want thompson and stanley to bond
@GRANDFIDDLE @AmandaPena13 scREAMS
i'm not actually that good at candy crush but i cannot for the life of me stop playing this stupid game
SUGAR CRUSH
'why love stan' why do i need a reason
@Pandandelion oooh. :U WELL WHATEVER WORKS ETC ETC. IM JUST. IM SO PUMPED UP.
gimme the big red demon babe
i never don't want to stream hellboy
it's an experience every hecking time
listening to florence + the machine is like when you sit in front of a fan listening to flight of the valkyries
@Pandandelion would be rude for -me- to ask your housemate when they're moving out
when will my cartoons return from the war
@Pandandelion SOON
wawa for dinner #blessed
@SweetMcGurran again im so grateful for that. your stuff is so good and I love all your theories ;-;
WERE LOSING HIM 
@SweetMcGurran + by the time the ep airs at this rate.
@SweetMcGurran + as a whole to chill out. we have a lot of time to fill before we find out anything. we're gonna be frothing at the mouth +
@SweetMcGurran and im rly grateful for that! i LOVE grunkle4grandpa, hell im rping it out on my Carla blog rn. i just want the fandom +
MOM I SAID IM BUSY 
@SweetMcGurran i just don't thin aggression is the way to get a point across. it's not everyone, but some of the supporters come off p harsh
@SweetMcGurran i certainly don't think you guys are heartless! you get fired up and stuff, that's understandable.
@AmandaPena13 i guess but that's just the way of fandom sometimes i guess. not everyone is going to be chill.
plays candy crush in bed wearing just a towel
if it ends up being true like i would like it to, ill probably stay on Twitter to avoid all the 'HAHA SUCKER TOLD YOU SO's'
idk i just hate being treated like im an idiot because i like to leave things up in the air
if grunkle4grandpa is true, and I love g4g, it hurts to know that because im skeptical, if it's true, I'll get it thrown in my face
the painful thing about it though is like
jiggly jiggly
playing with your boobs is so fun
i'm gonna go shower please continue to blow me twitter feed up with more delightful things
abuelita as a CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER THO [HEART EYES]
i do like the idea that abuelita was a photographer, hence all those glamour shots of soos in the house
she wasn't looking to hell when she mentioned her husband, se was looking beneath the floorboards
abuelita has probably killed people
@GRANDFIDDLE prehensile @soosramirez @marshalnevada get in the beard, shinji
@soosramirez vacuum that fucker right up
@AmandaPena13 @GRANDFIDDLE THAT THREAD WAS SO GOOD...... I LOVED... I LVOE....
rip big henry
at least one person has already died this season and we know the mayor will either eat it or get sent to another world
@AmandaPena13 yeah honestly i just. too many assumptions, tbqh, too many mean spirited mentalities.
@LovelyLadyLomps bruh
i need stan and carla to go to roller disco
@GRANDFIDDLE i honesly would not be surprised
@LovelyLadyLomps yEAHHH
time baby is going to turn bill into booboo keys
the only one that's gonna die is bill
@AmandaPena13 i know i know that pissed me off too like. why does intelligence mean anything in how you respond to LITERAL BRAINWASHING
@soosramirez @GRANDFIDDLE we're so close to going rabid we're all gonna turn into raccoon wife soon enough
@GRANDFIDDLE i don't have high school to sate my drama thirst so this is the next best thing
[rubs salt all over myself] good for the skin
@AmandaPena13 @soosramirez @GRANDFIDDLE rIGHT it's the reverse psychology thing. you force it and it makes people NOT want to believe it.
i should go shower
@soosramirez car_dad the star_dad
imagine bud gleeful with a twitter
@sludgebat we're talking bout aggressively snippy GF theorists and bad GF twitters
actual interview with stanley pines 
he probably runs contactee-confessions.
how many alien conspiracy blogs do you think ley runs let's be honest
I'M SO GIGGLY RN
@soosramirez i'm a sinner and a winner
@soosramirez stan is dril
GF theorists 
@GRANDFIDDLE I WAS BOUT TO POST THE GIF OF PLEAKLEY

@GRANDFIDDLE TRU
LUV MY DORK GRANDPA
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA MAKE M CRY????? I WISH I HAD THE MUSE FOR LEY
@GRANDFIDDLE @leghaus SCREAMS A LOT
my stanley is like 90% OC at this point lmao
stanley was too sweet 2 be author
@leghaus scREAMS LIES
+ and her liar boyfriend making excuses in the other i think she was a little torn
and i love when folks are like 'WELL WENDY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE HYPNOTISM' wendy had a 12 yr old yelling w/ his grunkle on one ear +
wendy's a smart cookie and she fell for it p. good
idk if intelligence has anything to do with susceptibility to hypnotism
what does that mean
also i'm still rly confused about the time twa said carla couldn't have been hypnotized because it 'was an insult to her intelligence'
@GRANDFIDDLE exactly!!! i'm prepared for whatever happens with carla, for example, i'm not getting too attached to any theory.
@GRANDFIDDLE i only trust hirsch and even that's a questionable choice
+ was canon and then it turn out not to be canon.
i don't WANT to get my hopes up over a theory that might not come true, i don't WANT to sit there and be heartbroken because i believed +
i made a gd stanley/author blog six months before NWHS aired but i always said, even then 'it's possible that it's not true'
it feels like shit to be told you're a moron and in denial when all you want is to wait for confirmation lmao
but no they were ripping me a new one regardless about evidence and proof
and i got like??? like i'm not saying it's not true i'm just saying i don't like putting all my eggs in one basket y'dig
+ i just said i think if it's true, there's more to it than is being presented.
twa leapt down my throat once because i said i felt like grunkle4grandpa was missing something, i never said i didn't agree +
and tbh it's almost like reverse psychology to a point, you know?
there was art and RP blogs and everyone was rooting so hard for it
remember when pip presented  stan twin theory and was like 'IDK MIGHT BE A LONG SHOT BUT COULD BE TRUE' and everyone jumped on it
@GRANDFIDDLE @soosramirez oh my god
ive gained a lot of followers thanks to this grunkle4grandpa thread it's kind of amazing
@vz132 TRU. VERY TRUE.
@vz132 she does not feel lucky let me tell you

[flings self into the void] this is fine
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
VAZ
what's up with this weird cat [animal is clearly a whale]
how to make me snort: call something a weird cat/dog
that shit kills me
like you throw something off screen and you just hear 'mREOW'
it's on par with an offscreen cat meow
i dont think ive ever been to a school assembly where i havent shouted 'freebird' at some point
favorite joke: someone very distantly yelling 'freebird'
me rn 
i cantbelieve it's happening
@vz132 WELCOME TO HELL WELCOME TO HELL
dare i tag this as 'AU'
and here comes the moment of truth
i mean most of my family watches fox news so it's hard to gauge reactions to that stuff
i'm pretty sure my one cousin is the gay cousin but it feels weird to ask
i'm the bi cousin
it's like me, my mom, my sister, and my one aunt and uncle are p. cool. I generally prefer my cousins.
@vz132 if it's any consolation there are very few members of my family i legitimately enjoy interacting with.
@vz132 its. it's gonna be full of a lot of things, I think.
@mightyenarc please do not talk about uncle raleigh peeing on the stove
i have a cousin who thinks obama controls the weather. so that's what i'm dealing with at thanksgiving.
welcome to the swift/farrell family, we really don't have any excuses or explanations.
@GRANDFIDDLE @AmandaPena13 my great uncle raleigh peed on an outdoor barbeque stove and got arrested and we don't talk about it anymore.
you live eight hours away? good, i will send you a christmas card and we don't have to talk about uncle raleigh peeing on the stove.
thing about irish catholic families is that my god we hate spending time together
@AmandaPena13 i guess it was less distance for my family and more interfamilial drama that kept us apart
regardless of what happens carla mccorkle is alive and she is powerful
@vz132 SAME THO..........
@AmandaPena13 never in my life
pennsylvania is like an hour, new york is like. two or three hours.
@AmandaPena13 ??? depends on the state
@AmandaPena13 have you ever tried to get a 70 year old to understand email, let alone skype
i have a grandmother that lives ONE state over and i don't even know her name LMAO
@vz132 UHHHH I'LL PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER. You want post-reveal?
it's very possible that the twins just don't have much contact with their grandma who lives on the other side of the country
and TBH i kind of assumed carla still lived in new jersey
@vz132 FUCK YEAH LET'S DO IT LET'S BLOW THE LID OFF THIS
@ ALEX HIRSCH PLS EXPLAIN
I'M CONFUSED TOO NOW
Carla leaves Stan. Maybe due to hypnosis, maybe not. REGARDLESS. Not too long after, she finds out he has -died-.
@AmandaPena13 @GRANDFIDDLE not if she was bitter and sad about it. consider-
that's not a lie you come up with after spendin an entire season claiming the supernatural aint real
stan didn't just pull hypnotism out of his ass okay
still holding out for hypnosis TBQFH
@AmandaPena13 SHE'S NOT A JERK AND SHE'S NOT DEAD HOW DARE YOU MAKE ME READ THIS WITH MY OWN FOUR EYES
@vz132 thEN LITERALLY PLS IF YOU EVER WANT TO I SO BADLY... WOULD LOVE....
@AmandaPena13 d o   n o t
@leghaus basically i like the cute tiny family stuff and also the 'HOW DARE YOU LET ME THINK YOU WERE DEAD, STAN PINES :'('
@AmandaPena13 I don't think Carla was a jerk, tbh. I think it's more likely that Stan pulled some shit.
@vz132 but you HATE grunkle4grandpa
@leghaus basically any point of view. Im trash who wants Carla and stan to slowly work up to caring about one another again.
@AmandaPena13 I think if it is true it's a lot more complicated or simpler than TWA makes it out to be.
i would pay money for someone to rp grunkle2grandpa with me
realized i never wrote down how carla ends up in GF for my RP blog so that's been rectified
Get ready to watch your 12 year old fantasies come to life. Streaming Jupiter Ascending right after I pee- 
'what are your qualifications-' hang on i gotta beat this level of candy crush
@karentozzi I'm really glad @spinningsea showed me your twitter because you absolutely delight me.
@soosramirez being like the lil bro from a Christmas story 'I can't put my arms down!'
put fids in every scarf and every sweater available
'gET YOUR ICE FEET OFF OF MY LEGS' 'make me waaarmmm'
i have that hc that stan gets cold very easily so mm. MM. WINTERY SNUGGLES CARLA KEEP ME WARM
[early spring] [thinks about cozy winter stuff]
carla in winter wear...
@GRANDFIDDLE NO RUSH NO RUSH. &lt;3
i was the only person in the theater when i saw it
if you go back far enough in my twitter you'll see me liveblogging jupiter ascending from the theater
@GRANDFIDDLE when u get home im gonna stream jupiter ascending
@AmandaPena13 ehehehehe wuff boyfran
@AmandaPena13 yeah i'll probably wait for when pen arrives, if she's into it. :U
when should i stream jupiter ascending
@soosody i will blow kiss
i don't have an aux port so i just have to dig around through the stuff that might work w/ a cigarette lighter plug
bluh i just want to play music from my iphone on my car radio but i can't tell what item on amazon DOES that
i don't get the smut stuff cause carla's in her 70s but my god if i get one more surprise family member
@soosody UGH RIGHT I HATE IT. i had some girl try and force me to accept her weird little OC as stanley's daughter once.
@soosody idk if they used my url specifically, but they've pretty clearly been using me as their grandma despite never having rped w/ me.
yep, def getting blocked. he had carla listed as his characters grandmother. which, fine, but don't assume im following ur canons broseph.
@soosody yeah i probably will after this.
@soosody yeah that's probably what i'm gonna do, tho i've told them that already so it's like... take my very clear hint pls.
@soosody thenobody0. just like... they seem like a nice person and all but how explicitly do i need to say i'm not interested?
go awwaayyyyy
you always send me memes but never specify which character the meme should be directed to and just
like dude i've already told you i don't see any way for carla to bond with your half demon half angel twins or w/e
@Pandandelion SO MANY STICKERSS
i can't tell if you want to make out with carla or be her grandson(sons?) you're a multi-muse OC blog who presumes things about my toon.
'do you RP with OCs?' yeah but i've already made it p. clear that i don't want to rp with you
@Pandandelion OH BTW my new bed has a wood headboard with white slats and i want to decorate it/paint it w/ FUN SHIT.
@Pandandelion that's like the main reason i want to move in with you, tbh.
at this point if my friends aren't sending me memes i get concerned
@Pandandelion i wouldn't have it any other way
@AmandaPena13 STILL IM SO GLAD BECAUSE THAT MOVIE IS A GEM.
JUPITER ASCENDING AND MAYBE ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN ARE HAPPENING TONIGHT
THAT WAS IT
@AmandaPena13 @soosody  Y E S
@soosody mmmmm maybe? i'll go digging. :U
@soosody i know i want to stream escape to witch mountain, but there was DEFINITELY somethin else....
i said i was gonna stream something last night but i cant remember what it was
@AmandaPena13 ive never had chicken and waffles D:
@AmandaPena13 oh geez that would be so much syrup
@AmandaPena13 + all i did was drizzle syrup on the chicken while it was frying and it came out tasting p. interesting.
@AmandaPena13 it did start to caramelize a bit so i had to be quick scrubbing out the pan and stop cooking after a bit but +
i just fried chicken in maple syrup what have you guys done today
protip: use maple syrup in the kitchen more often than breakfast
and this is exactly WHY you experiment in the kitchen holy shit
.....
i probably shouldn't experiment in the kitchen like this but i'm doing it

@PHUZface i can dig it
it always just leads back to 'You cough. You breath. You come back.' for me.
all my words of comfort are always very abstract it's so hard for me to articulate real words to make people feel better.
@PHUZface 'Rodents of unusual size? I don't think they exist.' *fids gets tackled offscreen*

any time i feel lost and confused and down on the world or myself or the things i'm doing i watch this video 
i always think about that bit robin williams did on inside the actors studio where he goes off about 'legalized insanity'
it ended up not working out, but the fact is you can always, always, always return to organized learning is a comfort to me.
my mother is in her 50s, and she went back to school a few years ago to be a nurse.
know that school is not a guarantee of how happy or successful you will be in life
i wish i could say smth to make folks feel better but the best i can do is just like
and lbr nyfa isn't a 'real' school, it's a program to learn different fields of the performing arts.
i dropped out of two different community colleges before i went to NYFA and that's where i really shined.
i just wasn't built for academia.
@GRANDFIDDLE I BASICALLY DID YEAH... IT'S OKAY I'M NOT LIKE UPSET ABOUT IT OR NOTHING.
school... school? oh yeah that thing that i. i dropped out of. oh yeah.
i need him to be like. tacky jerk. idk if that makes sense.
@leghaus agreed. but idk if im into full jerk.
i love jerk author but i hate the jerk genius trope my life is a struggle
and she henceforth refers to it as 'Alison Chicken'
which i started doing because i was lazy and in college

what if instead of a third eye stan's existing eyes just become one big eye

schrodinger's nanna
or the pines grandma
'tin foil hat's on too tight' this coming from the girl who thinks carla might be gideon's grandmother OR pacifica's grandmother
@soosramirez + stressful and painful to read thru. tin foil hat's on too tight.
@soosramirez idek i tried and failed. if it wasn't presented as 'IT'S TRUE AND YOU'RE AN IDIOT IF YOU DON'T THINK SO' it wouldnt be +
wyatt and jack look so good together in my mind because jack is HARDCORE RAZORBLADES and wyatt is hawaiian shirts and a ponytail

waking up and your blankets have changed direction???? ?? ??????
I humbly request to speak with the king of burgers
i'd track the 'starla' tag too if it wasn't for all the pictures of people's dogs
if the gravity falls fandom just had a degree of chill none of it would even bother me
@soosramirez ride my bike WHEREVER I WANNNNT
@soosramirez DO NOT GO UNARMED, THE TALL GRASS IS FULL OF WILD POKEMON
@AmandaPena13 well i track the carla mccorkle tag, and then their art pops up, so i start to BROWSE to see if i missed any untagged carla...
@soosramirez no don't you will only tear your hair out and stare into space wondering where the world went wrong
[points @ carla mccorkle] that my daughter
@AmandaPena13 ?? ? ?  NO ?? N O.......
it's just like half the theories feel like they're pulled out of thin air and are paraded around as irrefutable fact like??? chill
@AmandaPena13 they DO, but i'm my own worst enemy, i can't help but look. @_@
@SweetMcGurran i think they just do it like, they just follow people hoping to get more followers? lord only knows
doin that thing where i go on a blog for the art and i get headaches about their inability to concede that a theory might not be true.
@SweetMcGurran YE IT'S WEIRD LIKE. idk you're just gonna get a lot of cartoon crying but hey whatever floats ur boat.
@SweetMcGurran welcome to the club. i've got a LOT of BBW blogs following me for some horrible reason.
I AM GOING TO DRINK, ALL OF THE APPLE JUICE
'how are these the same person' remarkable, people are multi-faceted and layered beyond one dimensional, easily compartmentalized tropes
when toast was psyching me up to go to the bank last week 
@GRANDFIDDLE I WAS TOO SLEEPY AND TIPSY TO COMMENT LAST NIGHT BUT???? I CARED SO MUCH BY THE END
I took selfies of myself laughing at tpom last night but I am embarrassed by my whole face
[looks at the sun] get that shit outta here
penguins was amazing. the decision to drink during it, however, was a poor one.
my new bed is big enough for two people and my cat still fucking takes up the whole damn thing
but when i get drunk i get naked so
i have a full bottle of vodka in the kitchen i really need to indulge in more often
@AmandaPena13 THEY DO IT'S ADORABLE WOW.......
@AmandaPena13 I JUST GOT HOME I BOTH FEEL KINDA BAD AND ALSO DEEPLY SATISFIED
cops will turn on their own as soon as they smell blood in the water. it's a fact of the stress and atmosphere of the job.
the sudden de-stress of no longer having to work, coupled with existing undiagnosed heart conditions? yeah. retirement killed my father.
but they tried to frame him for tampering with evidence and forced him to retire early.
lmao I'll always remember that my father was meant to get a desk job and retire a few years later.
they are taught how to shoot, but not how to cope with the responsibility.
let it always be remembered that cops must qualify constantly with their guns, but mental evaluation is largely optional.
I watched firsthand how volatile and corrupt the police force as an institution is.
my father was a cop. i love my father. fuck. cops. your love for your relatives is not diminished in understanding that cops are killers.
fuck cops.
please save me from middle aged white women who want to chat
