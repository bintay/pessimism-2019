Thankful for everyone in my life being such a big help to my family and I right now.
I need to get together with my friends this weekend. Feels like it's been forever since I've seen them.
Junior year is the shittiest year of high school so far.
Well it looks like I need to work my ass of just a little bit harder to make sure I maintain good grades.
@MeeseGeese16 @AlexJWeather this is very true.
@MeeseGeese16 @AlexJWeather unfortunately not everybody can and does
@MeeseGeese16 @AlexJWeather but if people could all work their asses off we wouldn't have to worry about that
@MeeseGeese16 @AlexJWeather they think they're making it equal by giving minorities a boost. They're trying to get the rates up..
@MeeseGeese16 @AlexJWeather i know and honestly it is stupid. You should work your ass off no matter what ethnicity you are.
@AlexJWeather @MeeseGeese16 so they're trying to give other ethnicities a boost
@AlexJWeather @MeeseGeese16 no colleges are trying to make their campuses diverse bc white people have a higher rate of students in college
@MeeseGeese16 we talked about this in English &amp; it's because colleges don't want to be called racist for not being diverse.
@MeeseGeese16 what are the rules? Like do you have to maintain that GPA throughout all of high school or just your last year of high school?
@MeeseGeese16 that's ridiculous. I was thinking about trying to go to LCCC for my first two years of college.
