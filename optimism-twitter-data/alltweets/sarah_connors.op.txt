@elizabeth_werth NIKO ULKEMBERG
Maybe they thought that the lineup was so spectacular they didn't need to worry about spelling anyone's name right
they've cloned Ricciardo! And brought in some guy named Ulkemberg! Let's play count the typos 
LRT: yup. reminder that Barstool published this call to "publically execute protestors" organizing to combat racism 
@RoseTintedVisor you can do whatever the hell you want
@hoover_dam @BurkieYCP can we bring back tarring and feathering just this one time
and yeah "ignore them ignore them!" is easy for you to say, but not when you have to live here and hear about them pretty constantly
i'm not sure which i hate more, barstool or the fact that a LOT of people are actually praising their dumb as fuck publicity stunt
@clangager @robbtuftshockey yes a thousand pardons that absolutely should have been in sarcasm quotes you're right :(
@ISHA_AAM one of those guys runs barstool actually. smh
bayern more like bye-ern
@cyclechicster idk about that, i'm related to a bunch of 'em and they're terrible
i hate boston fans more than probably most people let's be real
You're not a hero for protesting against a dumb sports suspension. You're an idiot. A massive attention-seeking idiot shitlord.
what a fucking embarrassment to society.
one of these guys runs b*rstool sports. fuck off.  
@iancmclaren i hate it, it's been bothering me all day
Women Praying Furiously In Western Art History

@bergersteen A++++++

@bergersteen i would love to hit a revs game, for sure!
@bergersteen OH PERFECT im gone 22-24 i will still see you!! just lmk what you're up to, also i have a car, etc
@AndrettiFE @FIAformulaE @IMS @IBJnews Man, I would be there with bells on. Indy is a fun city.
@bergersteen YES GOOD

@HBAdventure it looks good and is right by my office!
Hey guess what 
@lakeline that is because you are an adult. being an adult is nice
@theactivestick people who self-declare as allies do not impress me at all. Ally is not a label you get to give yourself.
@MercedesAMGF1 @nico_rosberg Geez, maybe somebody has a future in endurance racing somewhere down the line post-F1....#somanylaps #nochill
So many guys think they can use their 'stockpile' of 'good ally-esque things they've done' to justify being a shitlord a few times. NOPE.
CHANCES ARE IT FUCKING IS.
This is applicable to so so SO many people i see cross my timeline every day in pretty much every facet of everything i find fun

@QUEENCRASH 24 is so young, jesus. tell them to leave you the fuck alone.
@RealViktoriya relatedly, though, this made me laugh quite a bit: 
If you donate $$ to the Pats to ~cover the fine~, you're a knob. Donate to my #hockeyfightsDV fund instead. 

@shaunacitynews I know I'm just one small voice but major props to you for calling those guys out. Seriously. Can't let this stuff just go.
@GJFKessler @jessespector yeah, I can't remember what it was but I have a feeling it miiiiight have been Moosehead.
@BReynoldsMN yeah, i joined on may 11, 2007. Pretty wild.
I'm really glad my taste in beer has improved from when I was 21... 
Oh sweet jesus I've been on twitter for eight years as of yesterday. What is my life.
@RealViktoriya 'MERICA, or something. :|

New Post: How does the cost of an affordable GP ticket vary by circuit? #formula1 
For example: on the @circuitamericas site, 3-day GA tickets are $169, while on @f1 ticket site they're $199? That's a bit bogus...
Weird thing I noticed: Why does the @F1 official ticket site price tickets higher than buying them from the circuits themselves? #f1
@AlsoNamedPhil not your actual body just the concept of dadbod
@GJFKessler awwwww <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> yes!
Jk I’m getting boloco, some things are good
Everything is bad nothing is good
Fuck your #dadbod.
@SilverstoneUK hello, track! i'm trying to budget a trip to you from the USA for the GP in july - will GA tickets sell out anytime soon?
fuck cancer.
@beckitastic NICE. let me know what attendance looks like! I'm going to Austria testing, and was curious...

@AGretz nope! she's just sitting in the middle of the floor meowing at nothing.
@maliciousglee it almost sounds like she's singing to herself, it's very cute
my cat is so weird. she has food, water, a clean litterbox, and she wont stop meowing. she's just sitting in the kitchen chirping to herself

Great #GP3 win for @OconEsteban! Not the most exciting race, but a fun watch anyway. #mercfamily
@Grace_Wilko and when i met felipe he was sitting down! gotta do that one again. XD
@Grace_Wilko if you manage to ever get the second one on camera/record it, I will make it my ringtone.
Since the Habs' season may end tonight, THIS COULD BE YOUR LAST CHANCE. So go contribute a few loonies or whatever. 
HEY FRIENDS GENTLE REMINDER THAT YOU SHOULD DONATE TO MY #hockeyfightsDV FUND. ENDS WHEN THE HABS' SEASON DOES. 
@Grace_Wilko the only driver i've met that i am not taller than is Hulk -___-

Super happy to see @scottspeed in the points after that disaster of a start. Great job, @andrettife! Can't wait for the next race already!

MY BUD IS IN MONACO CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS VIEW IS 
@RealViktoriya HOLY SHIT THAT VIEW
Just watched @AndrettiFE broadcast @scottspeed's car change on Periscope. Cannot say enough good things about #FormulaE's social media use.
@LiamPMcCausland i honestly cannot say enough good things about how fun Formula E is. Live and otherwise.
For as much as F1 isn't with the times WRT social media, FE is leveraging it to the best of their ability which is AWESOME for a new series
also they post giffable video clips of all the cool stuff that happens on their twitter feed right after it happens, which is awesome.
formula E streams all their races online for free, in case you're curious about this series and don't have cable! 
@carvinbass18 FORMULA E IS AN AWESOME DISASTER I LOVE IT. i went to the last race in long beach!
@Amanda_Speed :D 
@ShostDergon yeah he's fine!

@dommetoretto rockin that sweater so hard wow baby dommetoretto was adorbs
@phylliskessel13 it's as reflexive as my propensity to yell "IT WAS FOUR ONE" at random times

@GJFKessler @katiebakes @theactivestick your mom was correct
@katiebakes @theactivestick well yes because usually post-downpour you have to air dry! Air drying is SO IMPORTANT

What I'm also learning today: some Albertans get real uppity when you call them the Texans of Canada
@jessespector Hmm, Colorado could make sense too I guess. Not really enough oil though?
that said: yoooooo, flams. what an awesome game last night
What I'm learning today: Albertans are the Texans of canada
Well, McLaren, you can put lipstick on a pig, but....
LRT well that article is horrifying.
@phylliskessel13 I love that entire outfit oh my god
Josh just threw a hoodie out the third story window of our house so I didn’t have to go upstairs BLESS
Bollig’s clutchiness/60 is off the charts

@Mariia19 toss-up between hulk and thor because thor is basically a giant golden retriever puppy, lbr
@iancmclaren doesn't a sequel imply that it's a different story. which would imply that the initial story had ended
@stace_ofbase @BeccaH_JR @theactivestick this is timely, i had a nightmare last night that someone gave me coffee with mayo instead of cream
@CommissarTaco yeah, marvel fandom has always been a thing i can't get into, even more so now that the renner apologists are a thing
@CommissarTaco all this whedon nonsense and renner being an asshole etc etc
@lilybraden yes. what sort of file is it?
remember when people were actually hopeful and optimistic about marvel movies
@dimethyl @soxygeologist my school hate is cranked up to 6. that's probably it. i can't do classes anymore, i just can't.

Silversun Pickups were SO GOOD. I went home and immediately downloaded two of their albums.
OH WAIT i forgot another concert I really liked! Snow Patrol headlined, but OK Go and some randos called SIlversun Pickups opened.
@BurkieYCP ....my god i haven't thought about SR71 in at least 10 years
@BurkieYCP WHYYYYY WHY DO U ALWAYS KICK ME WHEN IM HIIIIGH
Concert-going just isn't really that vital to my music experience. It's cool that it is for some people, though!
I'm not really big on concerts. I think I probably COULD count the number I've been to in my life, and it's probably under 25. Oh well.


@hoover_dam oh wow, ok. luckily I am packing light for this trip o____o
@dommetoretto &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

@hockeyfied also why are you The Cheat
@hockeyfied yeah but that's a classic
i have shitty taste in music, i fully acknowledge this
And the BEST concert was....hmm. Probably a toss-up between Head Automatica at Avalon back in the day or Armin van Buuren at Axis
My first concert was Smashmouth at the Orpheum in Boston in 1999 with @soxygeologist. They were our faves in like 6th-8th grade :D

Decent weather to sit outside waiting for a bike shop to open imho 
@twowittoowhoo harpoon is a brewery!
@RoseTintedVisor oh just a road bike. :D
Getting my bike fixed, lunch with Couchsurfers, IKEA trip, home to build IKEA things, harpoon. Good day planned.
I wasn’t even referring to fans of my team THE HABS but uh safe assumption I guess
@jessinthenorth the pissbabies/60 is high tonight. I haven’t been on much and all I’ve seen is shit
Lotta pissbabies on Twitter dot com tonight
My cat has adopted my couchsurfer's backpack as her new home

Hawks would still be the most badass of the bird-named teams
"Well there's another big-4 sports team with that name!" yes 

did that stop the Rangers or the Jets? no
Blackhawks should be given the Devil Rays treatment. Just call them the Hawks, rebrand with bird logos. U can even keep the 4-feathers stuff
@superlicense @BoxOfNeutrals June 26 - July 1! (although july 1 i'll be camped out at The Maple Leaf for Canada day, all welcome to join)

@glitter4goals &amp; when I was in london i found a girl with a bruins bag in a tube station and we talked for like 15 minutes about our faves
@glitter4goals high-fiving other bruins fans while running a half-marathon in Montreal was super fun.

@HBAdventure @JustinDOY @GJFKessler they appear briefly, but NBCSN doesn't show much pre-or-post race stuff.
@JustinDOY @GJFKessler yes exactly. booth babes/ice girls/grid girls, all the same mold of crap
addendum: i wish i could mail a bag of poop to every dude who refers to a woman as a "female"
@JustinDOY @GJFKessler got rid of them, so dudes are all ~up in arms~ about them potentially going from F1
@GJFKessler @justindoy they're the scantily clad women that hold signs with drivers' names in F1. one of the other major race series just -

@tofuidol yeah, the question was mostly rhetorical. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@SilverArrowsHAM good morning????
Maybe asking him that question was silly but why does everything have to be serious 100% of the time? It was cute.
I thought Hawking’s answer was really beautiful, too.
I’m no 1D fan but why do people feel the need to put down and belittle the things that young girls fall in love with? It’s really sad.
Why? No seriously why.

@RaysArmyBlog i was at G7 vs montreal in '11. i have never been so happy.
@Cappuccijoe no one's done it more than boston in the last 8 years, and we didn't even make playoffs this year hahahahahaha fml

Of those nine game 7s in seven years, two were sudden death wins (TOR, MTL'11) and two were sudden death losses (CAR 09, WAS 12)
Bruins in G7's:
BOS v MTL 08: L
BOS v CAR 09: L
BOS v PHI 10: L
BOS v MTL/TBL/VAN 11: Wx3
BOS v WAS 12: L
BOS v TOR 13: W

I’m very tired at you, nhl.
I’m not gonna write a damn article about the Katy Perry chants and buttman's reaction, but I made some tweets earlier 
@bessyboo YES MY FIRST FANDOM HAS NOW CONNECTED TO MY MOST RECENT FANDOM AND I AM REALLY HAPPY ABOUT IT
@stace_ofbase "MANAGERS"
@estuarypalomino @stajans_girl 1) i have the same shoes 2) BHAVNAAAAAA THAT LOOKS AWESOME
@TyresAndTears yes we 100% do
Men Weigh in on the Katy Perry / Corey Perry Chants and Sexism in Hockey 
but also REALLY SAD because grey's was the first show not named Battlestar Galactica that i got really into in college
grey's anatomy killed off mcdreamy so Patrick Dempsey could focus solely on WEC and i think that's beautiful
@braudis no idea - we drove last time, and I was riding in the way backseat of a 15 passenger van
@braudis yes
@RealViktoriya also great american conor daly got a drive last week \o/

Still laughing my ass off about this tbh 
@pengvinvsed @braviary omg i wanna go
@avefrater the commissioner just came out and said a bunch of sexist nonsense. it's GREAT.
@kmartel_sports seriously love that video so much
hockey is supposed to be a pleasant distraction from real life. and for dudes, it is. It'd be cool if it could be for women, too. It isn't.
"And I know there are way more important things in life than football, but youre supposed to be our pleasant distraction from those things!"
This all reminds me of a great quote from the Cleveland Browns "Factory of Sadness" video, which i recommend to everyone:
And no, most men don't "get it" because they've never experienced this. Sports is for them! Why should they put themselves out to make room?
@BReynoldsMN @Kpower90 it's basically a constant thought in the back of my head, tbh.
But man, it does. Literally every day this league/sport does something that comes just short of explicitly telling women WE DONT WANT U HERE
tells you something that reaction from women of hockey twitter is exhaustion and resentment. Being a fan shouldn't wear you down like this.
@trot71  oh? 
if you're actually surprised that gary bettman is a sexist jerk then boy do i have a bridge to sell you
some sabotage in the #hockeyfightsDV page from a sens fan OH NO (thanks, @SensDewie19!) 
Happy game day/Friday, Habs fans! Today is a perfect day to donate to the Sarah-is-a-Habs-fan #hockeyfightsDV fund! 
@JoeYerdon toronto. yeah, yeah, their own undoing etc etc, but the 4-1 game was the straw that broke the camel's back imo
where is your god now, calder voters
@JoeYerdon the bruins altered three franchises in about a 2-year span. one has recovered, sort of.
@JoeYerdon /laughs quietly, forever

@BentleyTopShelf @barclayscenter @RoseTintedVisor you’re adorable
@RoseTintedVisor practice compartmentalizing your feelings. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@RoseTintedVisor its not disdain. It’s that I expect better of a city with so many good teams within striking distance. Come on now.
OH BOY RT @KINGoftheKC:  so you hate the fact I was a judge at a hooters bikini contest last night? Who's in the wrong me or the girls?
@RoseTintedVisor I doubt it but we shall see. It’s funny that a New York venue couldn’t draw four decent teams when even Belfast got 3
@RoseTintedVisor can't wait to see those attendance numbers my goodness
Also if you don't follow @WatchThisHockey you really should, dammit. Their coverage is already really extensive and great.
Hey twitter! @WatchThisHockey is looking to expand their writer base, if you or anyone you know wants to write about whky, give 'em a shout!

@RealViktoriya hah
@BaconCrush apprecating the ass doesn't mean i can't appreciate the pass
@SeattleSammichs no kidding. nothing like a side of hypocrisy to go with your misogyny i guess :|
It is pretty interesting that a male critique of women sports fans is "u only watch for the hot dudes!" ....and yet.... ..... ......
@Veltins_Bier i know right? ridiculous.
@Veltins_Bier oh hell no. i was thinking about going to Pocono this year and:

I BET IN EXACTLY TWO MINUTES I COULD FIND A RED WINGS FAN TO WRITE AMUSING, FUNNY COPY THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE MISOGYNISTIC BULLSHIT LIKE THIS

speaking of throwing dumb giveaway items onto the ice: remember that time the hawks had hard hat night and (toews, I think) got a hat trick

remember that time a tampa fan threw a noisemaker and hit krejci in the face
