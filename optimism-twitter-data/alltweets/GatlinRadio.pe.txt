I wish losing my virginity was as easy as losing literally everything at work.
@LuisGalarzaJr so far but Roddy white sitting out fucked me. I might lose this week. How's your team
@LuisGalarzaJr drew brees. I got big Ben riding the bench. Who you got??
@g_max05 I wish I had drafted him. He's a solid reciever. Who's your QB
After I didn't bench Roddy white this week I need Julius Thomas and Drew Brees to show out.
@g_max05 good point. But the coaches are gonna try to keep him healthy. That's a tough call.
@g_max05 I got Julius Thomas and he's normally good for a TD. If Denver gets down early I bet Demarius could have a huge game
Let's talk fantasy football.
@ATP303 yeah I understand. I hate when my players do good against the cowboys. Harvin is a solid flex though.
@g_max05 DeSean is not 100% and Denver gonna be going to Thomas a whole lot.

@jsprinkles21 #thestruggle
My girl @KenzieLetcher is the shit at madden 15.
Good times venting/catching up on the last 9 months with @iateyofaceoff
@iateyofaceoff the older generation who takes everything they read as fact. It makes ignorant more ignorant and you cant tell them different
@iateyofaceoff it's sad really. People put these fake articles out full of buzzwords just for the right side and it tricks
@iateyofaceoff haha its really annoying. I bet she shares 100 stories a day.
@TuckerMax in the NFL you can break any laws you want as long as your jersey still sells. Big Ben ray Lewis and Brandon Marshall prove it.
I wish no one would've showed Grammy the "share" button on facebook. So much thinly veiled racism. @iateyofaceoff
In the @nfl as long as your a successful player that sells jerseys you'll never get punished. #RayLewis #BenRoethlisberger #RayRice
Brandon Marshall has beat up like 6 women. #neverforget
I've been a haircut procrastinator since '93
