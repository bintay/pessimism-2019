It's gonna hurt losing her. But not as bad as her smiling and you not being the reason anymore.
Clearly didn't change
"Ok"
I'm. So. Stupid.
I love how everyone except the person I wanna talk to texts me
I would tweet about my night, but I'm always blabbering about you and I.
How could you let yourself get so blind and selfish
@DianaGCeballos1 I just regret doing it, the emojis are ugly <TIRED FACE>
Just closing my eyes
It's foolish how you keep me wanting more
I got some damn bad intentions
heart wants love
mind wants both
Or talk to you regardless
If they really love you they will make time for you
I wanna cry, you wanna fight
All this loving goes in vain
I hate when the moments expected
Perfect right now.
the weeknd &gt;
Somewhere between a grudge and I forgive you, somewhere between I hate you and I love you
Somewhere between I'm healed and I'm grieving
Pardon me for judging you I guess that's just all I'm exposed to
So I stayed and yeah maybe that makes me dumb, but those who never loved will never know where I'm coming from.
@_petalpusher <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><DIZZY FACE><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
I like a clingy person, they make me feel loved.
Hesitating to see my aunt when she was sick was where I screwed up. She passed on my bday, after that I never took time w ppl for granted.
when I stop let's see if it's even noticed.
Just going in circles
I can't be upset all the time <UNAMUSED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
So much it's just unbelievable
What is the fckn point anymore
why wouldn't you wanna show your girlfriend/boyfriend off?
After today I ain't doing that shit anymore <UNAMUSED FACE>
Some people are praying for what you take for granted..
It's only so much a person can take
Why go outta your way of someone won't do the same for you
Really got me thinking
A little piece of me dies every time I see that picture
It's crazy how you can see one thing &amp; it brings you back to a time you didn't like at all
Everyone goes through shit
Part of building a relationship is sticking around through the tough times not just the good ones
Being loyal isn't hard at all, especially if you truly love your significant other.
Crying over boys is stupid &amp; you should never do it.
I just want your time
used to
but i'm used to it
So done with bs
@jojoxo___ dime

Love being a big secret.
I'm not fine at all, but you seem happy af.
