So much great work emerging on long term imprisonment. Essential that it reaches judicial decision making (and lawyers) #EuroCrim2014
Presented this evening on human dignity and long term sentences, comparing SCOTUS and ECtHR. Thanks to @IrishResearch #EuroCrim2014
Two of our #PhD students @ditofficial presenting innovative and unique work at #EuroCrim2014 @ColetteBarry and @Kate_O_Hara #criminology
.@ColetteBarry presenting exciting findings from her @IrishResearch funded study on the experiences of prison staff re major incidents
Paper by @AlexStevensKent was exemplary #EuroCrim2014 
Well done @Kate_O_Hara on presenting findings on study comparing community service&amp; short term custody at #EuroCrim2014 today! @ditofficial

Will be doing a blog for @Preg_Research on pregnancy and having children in prison. Contact hugely important #woti
Here are the Bangkok Rules, which emphasise non-custodial options for women #woti  
Lack of an open centre for women is a huge issue. Unnecessary costs, too. #woti
Catching up with #woti. Huge changes in penal policy when this can be made. Timely, as numbers of women in prison rise.
Hope you enjoyed the cupcakes at induction today, DT532! @ditofficial #law
Looking forward to welcoming our new law students (DT532) to @ditofficial today!

This blog on proportionate sentencing and Art 3 draws on a longer piece for Public Law in 2015. 
Delighted to write a blog for @PenalReformInt 25th anniversary. A great organisation and much-needed.  
@colinlenihan I think a draw was fair overall. Pleased to see courage in the Mayo team. I thought Donaghy would eat us. Here's to round 2!
@colinlenihan how are the nerves, Colin? #shredded
@msaoife v interesting on this as a theme. Must get out of prison law more often!
@msaoife got the HC decisions in via proofs, the SC one will be in by the skin of its teeth I hope! No more emergency sittings now, please!
@VGeiran thanks Vivian! Hard to see anyone beating the Dubs this year, but we continue to dream!
@Elliel19 @colinlenihan ha ha! Thanks! #upmayo
@colinlenihan enjoy it, Colin and good luck to you too!
@colinlenihan ah ye might let us have one!

The poll results so far are interesting! @VGeiran @thejournal_ie @DeirdreMalone9 @IPRT
@msaoife Hi Aoife! Yes, and after so much deference in prison cases highly unexpected!
The written judgment in Ryan will be of major importance to remission and prison law generally.

Fascinating piece on the life of a senior prison manager 
@odowdt thanks, looks great! Strategic litigation v difficult for NGOs, have to think of alternative strategies for legal change.
@NadineORegan very nice of you. @ditofficial may be able to help.
Very important recommendations made on conditions and independent complaints' mechanisms in prisons #ICCPR 
@odowdt sounds like a great module!
How interesting, what language is best for penal reform groups seeking to influence policy on women who offend. 
Graph from Home Office report on heroin and crime 
Home Office report looks at heroin use and crime in Ireland. Also interesting modelling of crime rates.

@KKSoodLaw @TheHowardLeague many congratulations. This is brilliant.
I was really inspired when I heard @KKSoodLaw speak about being a prison lawyer at the @TheHowardLeague conf. Paper: 
@michaelkls virtual hugs to that presenter! I always knew you chemistry types were sound!
@michaelkls you could lead that session!
Great opportunity for a funded PhD at Waterford IT on prisoners' awareness of their rights.  
Good to see judicial assistant roles advertised, but the courts service and others need more staff with training in statistics.
Also important on whether to proceed by way of Article 40 or JR in prison issues. 
Important case on enhanced remission. 
Good to hear of plans to increase types of complaints by prisoners subject to independent oversight #ICCPR 
An often overlooked @DeptofJustice report on experiences of imprisonment for fine defaulting

@donnchanuig @michaelkls *blushes*. Thanks! I'm not in the hapenny place compared to @michaelkls!
Promise to examine issue of imprisonment for debt and fine default further. #ICCPR
Hope the emphasis placed on data in the Government's remarks will be felt across all justice issues, especially penal policy #ICCPR
#data #ICCPR

Data collection and publication arises again #ICCPR
Minister @FitzgeraldFrncs refers to proposed legislation on fines and imprisonment in her speech: 
Very strong criticism of the use of prison for failure to pay fines. Contention that it is also, in effect, discrimination. #ICCPR
Imprisonment for debt and fines criticised. #ICCPR
Prison issues being raised now. #ICCPR
@IPRT Thanks, our webcast is not working at present, so all tweets appreciated!

#ICCPR event also a wonderful opportunity to observe policymaking process in action.
Focus of @IPRT submission on the importance of strong mechanisms for achieving accountability in detention #ICCPR
Questions from the #ICCPR Ctte demonstrate the importance of good record keeping and data in places of detention.
Here's the @IPRT submission on the #ICCPR. @DeirdreMalone9 addressing the Ctte today.  
It's not the leaving of Liverpool... #bsc2014 lots to think about re connecting human rights and criminology. 
Article 8 is having important effects on prison visiting conditions Scharff-Smith at #bsc2014
Impact on adolescents of the imprisonment of a mother is under explored #bsc2014
Masson: costs, difficulty travelling and concern about effect of being in prison militated against children visiting their mothers #bsc2014
Isla Masson speaking on her study: only a minority of children of imprisoned mothers stayed in their own home. #bsc2014
Great work from @ShonaMinson on prisoners' families. Much to learn for @IPRT research on this topic #bsc2014
Interesting- community style courts can allow more use of criminological knowledge #bsc2014
Interesting problems - do spent convictions "travel"? Whose rules apply? #bsc2014
Jamil Muguzi: 10 year period for expungement is too long #bsc2014
Expungement laws influenced by politicians' experiences of imprisonment in SA #bsc2014
Minor offences and offences not subject to prison, expunged after 10 years in SA #bsc2014
South Africa: if a person is acquitted or not prosecuted, DNA record must be destroyed #bsc2014
Presenting work on #Vinter and the role of judges in penal change at #bsc2014, with thanks to @IrishResearch New Foundations scheme.

Important points here about weaknesses in our systems of inquests from @IreHumanRights 
The apology to the Douch family is  both welcome and an important moment in the history of prison policy.  
Much arising from the #McMorrow report. A lesser-told story is the experiences of prisoner fatalities among staff. @ColetteBarry to remedy.
@patleahysbp @ivanabacik @BurrenLawSchool @burrencollege looking forward to the School (and jokes) very much!
Obligation to investigate deaths in custody is at the core of Article 2 ECHR.

Most interesting UK court allows Hindu prisoner to perform father's last rites. 
The state visit will also hopefully prompt discussions regarding the role of the children of returned emigrants in Ireland. #Iamone
Think the visit by the President is also a useful time to reflect on the contribution of our returned emigrants to Irish life.

Peter Ward SC hits the nail on the head. Professionalised, resourced NGOs are essential to advance issues. #pila2014
So much to reflect on in Albie Sachs' speech today. The importance of NGOs, possibilities for law, the understanding of dignity. #PILA2014

A very easy but hugely helpful way to encourage understanding of trends in criminal justice would be for agencies to publish data in excel.
Prison committals falling, but why? Lots of whys and mights here. Need real data and investigation. 
1983 was a pretty grim year in a grim decade for prison policy. Doubling up is introduced. 
And the Govt plans a Ctte of Inquiry into the penal system... #1983 
1983: DoJ fears prison system could not cope with levels of overcrowding. Memories of '72 still fresh. 
Community service orders were introduced in 1983. Michael Noonan was the Minister, but the original PMB was introduced by Alan Shatter.

A list of interesting studies carried out with prisoners and staff in Ireland 
Just caught up on the news. That analysis of the risk of assault on O'Connell St by a senior Garda was remarkable. Headlines you don't see.
Obama commutes drug sentences (crack cocaine), referring to the high cost of imprisonment. 
No reference to prison cases from Ireland before ECtHR 
@IrishResearch funding applications for postgraduate study. Deadlines approaching 
Submissions sought on reforms to the ECtHR 
Much greater examination of Art 40.1 in Byrne than in Callan re remission  
@VGeiran O'Connell St's loss very much Smithfield's gain.
I missed this in Nov: Guardian's obituary of David Thomas. A remarkable man able to blend academia&amp;legal practice. 
@sarahanderson26 thanks again, Sarah!
UN rules on women in the criminal justice system emphasise non-custodial options and gender-sensitive community orders.
Was also very interested to hear about models of penal change today. Input from non-cjs agencies v important.
Bangkok rules apply to non-custodial sentences for women as well as to prison. @PenalReformInt has great resources on this.
@ivanabacik thanks, Ivana! Sub-Ctte has set the tone I think:
@VGeiran @IPRT thanks, Vivian. Good to see ye represented and to get everyone around the table.
@TtohBee @IPRT thanks very much. I enjoyed it too!
@eilomccaffrey @sarahanderson26 @IPRT many thanks!

@marktelford that is a shame, but certainly looking forward to seeing you. Should be a great couple of days. Hope to be tweeting!
@ShonaMinson indeed; it's a good dilemma to be in! Will be nice to meet another barrister-criminologist. Should be a great event.
@LauraPiacentin2 Hi, Laura, I'm enjoying your work in the new collection on punishment in Europe.
Trying to decide what to see at the @TheHowardLeague conference is extremely difficult. Child in a sweet shop territory.

@Claredaisy I think a lot of lawyers and students would welcome that training.
Prof Lynch speaking very clearly about the distinctions between justice and a charity.  #macgill13

Really interesting points about the narrowness of what we teach in 2nd and 3rd level. Amazed we don't teach lawyers statistics. #macgill13

I wonder if the Governor of California @JerryBrownGov discussed prison issues in his meeting with the Taoiseach!

Pity that the equality arguments weren't canvassed in #Callan as the ECHR is indicating a more expansive approach to Art 14 re prisoners.

Hope we see some detail about arrangements for the u 18s: visits; education etc.
St Pat's was so named in the mid 50s after moving those in the 'Borstal' to the then women's prison at Mountjoy.
St Pat's to close, but huge need for a strategy for those aged 18-21 as well.

@eoincarrollis @iprt thanks, Eoin, on the ball as always! I crunched some numbers here ages ago: 
#PhD scholarships available in @ditofficial. If you're thinking of PG study in the area of prisons do get in touch. 
Short, but symbolic, reference to working on statistical analyses of #prison and #probation #data in joint strategy. 
Looks like @Kate_O_Hara's study of CSO v short prison sentences is more critical than we thought, even! @IPRT
@IPRT @gillianrsmith This is very interesting; thanks for posting.  Thinking of the work of @AzWahidin on older prisoners.
Probation annual report has a section entitled 'Research'. *Becomes misty-eyed* 
There is huge potential to involve CSO in mining prison data. Their imaginations could transform the data published. 
@IPRT otherwise disappointingly little change in what's published.
@IPRT are the stats better?!
Here's the report @liamherrick was speaking about on @morningireland today. 
Not certain of the detail, but the language of Min Quinn regarding a research base for policy on @morningireland was quite striking.
Seymour&amp;Costello's study on homelessness&amp; prisoners still resonates. Again, social policy issue w penal policy consq. 
Cloverhill Visiting Committee says it met 32 prisoners last year. 
Dóchas Committee also recommends greater involvement of Citizens' Information regarding release. Lots of scope there. 
Great to see the Dóchas VC report outlining number of announced and unannounced visits. This info should be standard. 
@niamhpuirseil *one of* the only, sorry. Archives needs resources too.
@NiamhPuirseil really disappointing to hear this. #NLI is the only place to get Govt materials on history of prison policy.
Wonderful event on the legal history of capital punishment next Monday. 
@ChildrensOmbuds your recommendation re data is crucial and applies across services. Thank you for raising it.
It's review week @ditofficial and the library's hopping. Stay calm, everyone!
Annual penal statistics from @coe countries.

Interesting, Ireland's prison population is young by CoE standards 
Compares "surface area" per prisoner across CoE countries  
SPACE penal statistics across Europe. Cost per prisoner ranges fm €3 to €750 per day. SPACE will drive prison stats. 
@unspeakable28 TH certainly slowed down policy development I think.
Californian plan to reduce overcrowding by further 7000 releases. 
Slopping out in Mountjoy to go. Govt policy was to eradicate it by year 2000 once upon a time.

@prisonerben a fair point, Ben. What we measure is symbolically and practically important. Our stats are really v underdeveloped.
MoJ can produce re-offending rates by prison. 
Missed this yesterday, re-offending stats from England and Wales. Agog at the data they can produce. 
Place a wreath upon his door.. George Jones RIP.
We run a clinical legal education model @ditofficial where @IPRT is the 'client'. Supports NGO with research capacity.
Very much agree with the sentiments being expressed at #irishclinlegaled regarding the importance of reflection in clinical ed models.

Since #CA restarted capital punishment (78), 58 prisoners have died fm natural causes, 22 thro' suicide. 14 executed. 
Position on the treatment of prisoners with mental illness restated in Aswat. 
#ECHR position on v long sentences restated in Aswat. Very difficult to show disproportionality such as to violate 3. 
@Weaver_Allan Many, many congratulations. It's just brilliant.
Well done to all involved in 'The Road from Crime'. Superb teaching resource (and many other things). #Inspiring. 
Detailed report by #IMB on Harmondsworth prison. This kind of detail and presentation would be welcome in #Ireland. 
Headed for @UCDLawSchool to hear Prof. Denis Bracken speak about his latest research.
Well isn't this interesting. Attitudes to social policy; what does this say for link with prison numbers? #welfarism 
Promise to reduce Californian prison population by a further 10,000 inmates. 
@weaver_beth now you're talking! You can do it!
Here are the latest crime statistics for Ireland for 2012. 
@emmaslah which would be 7 per day ( if my rubbish maths are ok). I wonder how recording is done? Most interesting.
@emmaslah how interesting. Looking at the CSO stats there were 2818 robbery (plus hijacking, extortion, all grouped together) in Irl in 2012

@GuySkelton It's a very interesting one all right. And as for the reoffending rates.... Small prisons seem to do better too.
Students asked me for examples of best penal practices from around the world. Interesting question! Any thoughts?
Look forward to seeing #CBL and #CBR getting more and more recognition and support in the coming years.
Reminded of the exceptional work being done by students, academics and community partners as part of community-based learning programmes.
A great website for those interested in community-based learning and research. 
Thoroughly enjoyable evening at #acjrd Martin Tansey lecture. Reminded again of the absence of dialogue between lawyers and statisticians.

@socmot nice to meet a graduate, even if only on twitter.
@socmot did you really? I used to teach Foundations... Some great grads! Well done.
I wonder which is most convenient/effective for part-time students, evenings or weekends? I've experienced both. Both tiring!
@socmot wow. It's amazing how you get into the grind of it! Did 3 years myself between different things.

Treatment of prisoners with mental illness still a problem in CA. Further judicial supervision ordered. 
#Mayo in the semis, #Down relegated. Glad I'm not at home.
@VGeiran thanks, Vivian. I'd say you have many insights on the policy process to share, would be great to hear them sometime! Enjoy the day.
@Kate_O_Hara @iprt @blalygamal @colettebarry oh no! I think I'm about to agree to something!!
@VGeiran and individual I think. Have a PhD student looking at the policy process around post release supervision. We will keep you posted!
@VGeiran it's all so interesting! Are you thinking about sociology of work cultures? The big challenge is to link the political, cultural..
@VGeiran draws on political science but it would be very interesting, I think, to stick a psychologist into the mix!
@VGeiran and to see if or how 'groupthink' is involved, or what the role of emotions or values might be. The policy analysis literature ..
@VGeiran Hi Vivian. I think it would be interesting to explore what motivates individuals to take decisions which are courageous/irrational
@caoilfhionnanna Thanks, Caoilfhionn. Hope you enjoy the weekend too!
Do the Flora women's mini-marathon for @IPRT! I am willing to endure the shame again... 
Think policy analysis would benefit from the input of psychologists.
