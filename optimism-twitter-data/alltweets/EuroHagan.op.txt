@1815Project my pleasure
@TulipSiddiq I'm proud to have helped: all the best!
Have 2 say #ThankYouEd stopped war on Syria, changed the debate on energy prices, helped stop Scots Indy, sent press barons running 4 cover
@bernardmccabe I think that's true, we've been at this kind of politics longer. FST would seem 2 prove logic of pacts
@bernardmccabe there were attempts to, but still didn't work
@bernardmccabe well I don't think that was clear until early this morning, but well
@bernardmccabe well I think the results were very unfair to Scottish Labour in general!
@bernardmccabe It's hardly cowardly though to stand down after so long
@bernardmccabe that's unfair Ben, especially after all work they did in independence referendum, they've served a total of 70 years as MPs!
@IsabelHardman hasn't he resigned yet?
@willquince well done Will!

@Independent that's one church I've never had faith in
@DonalLyons different prayers at Tory HQ
@DonalLyons 
@naushabahkhan you were a great candidate: please stick at it!
@ianjamesparsley Stormont Rushmore strikes again

Probability British EU referendum will happen in close proximity to France &amp; Germany's elections will weigh on both 
@ConorMcGinn congratulations, you'll be a great MP!
In my area "Cannabis is safer than alcohol" got double the number of votes Tories got. Locals think Cannabis is safer than Tories!
Can someone check immigration at New York's airports? Has David Miliband been spotted boarding a flight to leafy North London?
DUP's Simon Hamilton on #bbcr4today talking abt "range of issues" he claims now to care about, issues his party largely ignored up until now
@kevinpbreslin I don't think they did
@IEPrainsack enschuldigu! so spate fuer mich :( morgen wir kunnen spraechen ueber eine Euro-referendum - Dom spiro spero!
@tim_brannigan I did smile! I've heard it all before and I do love a good aubergine!
@IEPrainsack Ich bin wach, aber fast untröstlich , ich bin 1 Gläubiger , und so lange, wie ich überleben werde  Ich in 1 Zukunft zu glauben!
@naomi_long I'm proud of your record as Alliance's 1st MP &amp; I'm proud to have campaigned for you &amp; wish you the best for the future!
@Markfergusonuk he's a great guy &amp; hope he'll be back
@tim_brannigan but candidate likely to say "those dark days don't define us - let's look to the future" and for that alone: well done!
@kevinpbreslin @gerrylynch not really Plaid Deynras Unig Anniybol is my basic translation but PDUA doesn't quite sound right
@andrewgdotcom they're not "official unionists" as we say
@proinsias87 I think comparisons may end there but the night is young #enjoy
@RichardJMurphy well said! they want to decommission all weapons except the starting gun for the race to the bottom
@proinsias87 yes but 100 years apart in a different country, let's see
@Kilsally @BetterOffOut but Peter Robinson saying he was pro-membership wish they'd make their mind-up #betteeoffin
@nwbrux best wishes for a long night ahead!
@proinsias87 I would be wary of such comparisons
@hmeyerUK @mvanhulten Scotland tells us neither
@kennedylive BTW I'm stuck at UK embassy crying into my beer
@zaksuff I do and it looks like I'll stay here if that vote is right!
@France2londres Cameron a laissé beaucoup De "preconditions" pour referendum, aucun deputé est elu est rien est decidée.
@zaksuff that's a joke right?
@roywhite_ni @History_Pics not sure, is that Adml Dönitz on left? That would suggest Berlin
I voted in #GE2015 4 candidate who won't win but was tactical vote. My tactic was 2 show big parties they don't represent me #StepForward
@EuroHagan I hope @jpswansea can sympathise
@emilywigens there are in Northern Ireland normally

Marks&amp;Sparks opening in Brussels tmrw promises "un café, une bakery et des cookies" French so patchy must be a traditional English brand
@thehistoryguy are you two lads coming to Belgium for the bicentenary next month?
@UKLabour I can't because you sadly don't stand in NI but you have my support all the same! #VoteLabour
@DeborahJaneOrr potentially very destructive and like you say "unworkable"
@DeborahJaneOrr "Deliver us from EVEL" is what we must pray to who ever gets the keys to No.10
@markphelan101 och Mark how you doing?
@DonalLyons I had no idea the Tribune was still going?
@jamesstevens good point! Many English folk love England 2 much 2 let selves be represented by Tory-UKIP jingoism: same goes for rest of us!
@OwenJones84 you seem to have left Northern Ireland out of this, but apart from that you called it exactly right! #wellsaid

@SMcC_TheDetail yes, but they're related
@SMcC_TheDetail UKIP will have more letters in their name than MPs come Friday. SNP considerably more
@tnjharris indeed, I really now lament that #AV didn't pass in 2011
All this talk of a possible second general election this year shows how pointless the Coalition's fixed-term Parliament's Act was #GE2015
@brosie8 @lucymoylan sadly not I fear
@kathyclugston thanks for the follow! Your homely tones calm my homesick pangs, don't expect as much from me though
@lucymoylan wait for the unholy hoo-ha to come!
@davekitching good luck Dave! @AudienceNet is lucky to have you!
@frwhiskeyblog @SluggerOToole @dmcbfs they've probably had stranger requests
@frwhiskeyblog @SluggerOToole @dmcbfs short answer: no. I just remember BBC graphics at the time- ask them
@Aleks_Paris @brusselslabour @LabourIntl @ParisLabour @PSE_Paris magnifique!
@dmcbfs @SluggerOToole in '97 General election UUP took 80% of Unionist vote, DUP on 20. Would suggest GFA was turning point
Have @brusselslabour or @LabourIntl been to Paris lately?

@CiaraBurb yeeeeeoooowww! Mint teas are on me
@mnottingham @labour4europe @josephinewood @earnshaw1  @giampialhadeff our pleasure!
@CiaraBurb let's do that: free for a drink this week (or tonight?)
The first bit of good news from #GE2015 
@bartoncreeth by the way I wasn't in anyway comparing the SDLP to any of the unpleasant groups listed here: far from it
@JustinKaneC we'll we shall have to see just how enlightened they are
@JustinKaneC...she obviously didn't want to vote or them but said it good to see NI getting some "normal" politics. Thought was interesting
@JustinKaneC I'm not a Tory so can't comment on how  affects morale etc. I recall Kate Hoey at the time welcoming thier decision to stand
@ClaireHanna @bartoncreeth if you could attract no. of votes they're getting! Interesting thing is how 'parked' Const issue in Scotland is
@ClaireHanna @bartoncreeth true, I think again long-held perception comes into play here (of both parties &amp; other communities)
@ClaireHanna @bartoncreeth true, I suspect as Cllr, you have a good view "bread &amp; Butter" issues
@ClaireHanna @bartoncreeth true &amp; have to acknowledge good work of many good individuals here (including many in SDLP)
@kevinpbreslin @FitzjamesHorse @JustinKaneC hmm was hoping for better on sunny May bank holiday. Well here's 2 a Labour victory on Thursday!
@bartoncreeth I get unnerved by nationalism in most forms, find it narrow &amp; parochialist. Very upset by BNP, EDL, UKIP forms of Brit n'ism
@bartoncreeth 2 b honest, never really thought what such party would look like &amp; is hard 4 any party to shed long-held perception of itself
@kevinpbreslin @FitzjamesHorse @JustinKaneC Quite depressing view. Don't think I cud ever reconcile myself 2 politics based on that premise
@bartoncreeth appreciate question.  Really it would have 2 abandon or step back from nationalism in most forms + I'd have 2 move back first!
@FitzjamesHorse @JustinKaneC @kevinpbreslin I think you've articulated clearly why SDLP alienates so many potential voters. Why is UK in""s?
@roywhite_ni @bartoncreeth I would like a bigger umbrella, I don't believe I fit under an SDLP one...then again I'm a bit chubby
@JustinKaneC @kevinpbreslin yes, nothing much seems 2 have happened since. I think getting Southern Labour on-board may be what's needed
@bartoncreeth of course I mean "where its consequences have led" apologies
@bartoncreeth I'm afraid narrow interest politics are an all-too present force in NI. Rise of SNP may make them more prevalent in rest of UK
@bartoncreeth I think everyone who voted against AV in 2011 should consider where it's consequences have led
@bartoncreeth Few can regret in the inclusion of greater options at the ballot box surely? Rise of SNP gives me the chills
@JustinKaneC well good luck!
@JustinKaneC are you headlong in the campaign for Dr McDonnell presently? How's it looking for him?
@JustinKaneC well I never suggested they'd win any seats sadly but I think it would be a worthwhile signal.
@kevinpbreslin I do reckon you're correct. Just seeing present Labour positions on SNP &amp; SDLP looks odd to many I suspect
@kevinpbreslin there are different networks &amp; groupings, currently GMB members in NI pay to a Labour party they can't vote for
@kevinpbreslin just currently in very sharp relief when you consider current attitudes re: possible coalitions or post-election manoeuvring
@kevinpbreslin true to an extent but it's hardly insurmountable. Some Trade Unions operate across British isles
@edel_fitzgerald he has done before, I was in Thanet yesterday, no-1 told me they were voting UKIP, no activists, polls put Tories ahead
@JustinKaneC that is correct Justin, however in my experience European affiliations count for little: especially very loose ones like EFA
I always wonder why Labour treats SDLP differently from SNP &amp; Plaîd. Hopefully next time @LabourPartyNI will have its own candidates
@marathonbcm 
A real pleasure this weekend seeing @texasglasgow on #texas25, 19 yes since I first saw them live. Sharleen's voice as incredible as ever!
If you think the SNP are a left-wing force, think again 
@brusselslabour @willscobie I'll see you guys in Ramsgate
@willscobie I'm on the train from St Pancras to join you &amp; @brusselslabour campaigning today: looking forward to it!
I first campaigned with @TulipSiddiq 6 years ago: this time next week she could be @KilburnLabour's MP! #VoteLabour 
Great to see so many Irish heads @labourirish @AodhanORiordain @c_quigley &amp; @KilburnLabour 2day for @TulipSiddiq ! 
@AodhanORiordain a pleasure to meet you today with @KilburnLabour I'll pass on your best to @LabourBrussels !
@AodhanORiordain @labourirish @YesEquality2015 my pleasure to take that 1: thanks for helping out @TulipSiddiq @LondonLabour today!
This was 10yrs ago but I really hope @Portadownfc can bring back from the trophy today #CupFinalDay 
@TulipSiddiq could I join one of your teams in the afternoon?
@etonmessuk @DAaronovitch just to add to that 
@EuroHagan @ITV are showing the film now, I've still never been able to watch to the end #neverforgotten
@Desmond_Funk I'm not optimistic but happy that going to Portadown vs Cliftonville at Shamrock Pk is nothing like what it used to be in 90s
@Desmond_Funk does this mean you'll be cheering-on @Portadownfc in tomorrow's IFA cup final? #culchiepower #biggestteamoutsidebelfast
With just under a week to go @brusselslabour are with @ClairHawkins &amp; @DoverDealLabour today #VoteLabour #GE2015 
@jonworth that may well be the best on offer! Not long now
@jonworth but we'll see. Nice talking to you. Now it's really bed-time. Gute-nacht!
@jonworth yeah but that would play to their narrative in the long-run. They want to damage Labour in Scotland &amp; generally toxify Westminster
@jonworth well, his attitude may change after results are in. But do SNP want a deal? They want to win Holyrood 2016 against Labour
@jonworth well election time I suppose, he has to do something to support Scottish Labour candidates...anything!
21 years to day when Ayrton Senna made his final race. He would have been 55 by now. #SennaSempre 
@jonworth he opposed the SNP then, he opposes them now
Some say #SinnFein  aren't a sectarian party... Seems some would disagree #secterianism  
NI's election is being ridiculed NY national media again in a way no one in NI should take issue with 
Meanwhile Scotland's 1st Minister is telling everyone what a shame food banks are ...from the proximity of her helicopter! #SNPout
@keithellison as a European I dread to think the impression Geert Wilders would give in the US. I admire the stand you've taken sir!
Someone I work with &amp; formerly respected has just told me he likes Mrs Brown's boys...not sure I know what to think about him know
I find this hard to esteem credible 
This is very good on #DUP &amp; #GE2015 prospects for hung parliament 

@FT today Bournemouth's promotion to Premiership= "fairytale". Congrats due but must modern footy fairytales include Russian billionaires?
Even DUP (no strangers to cuts) pick holes in Tory welfare spending plans: pre-elec posturing or genuine concern? 
@roywhite_ni certainly deal (of 1 kind or another) with SNP &amp; DUP, an interesting mix. Lab +SNP +DUP= largest parties in Wales, Scot &amp; NI
Now this is interesting, &amp; dare I say positive stuff from NI parties in #GE2015 
@JohnRentoul that's true but I think no more than ever it'd be helpful to include the numbers #theawfulfeelingofbeingignored
@StevenAgnew I think so too, good luck with the rest of your campaign!
Good luck to all @brusselslabour volunteers hitting the pavement in Kilburn today with the brilliant @TulipSiddiq ! Not long to go now!!
@StevenAgnew very good point but a pretty old map
@JohnRentoul @IndyOnSunday any reason to exclude NI parties &amp; their 18 seats?
This @thesundaytimes front cover says it all. 'Uncontrolled wealth: but Heaven forbid anyone do something about it!' 

It's a pity this man isn't on the ballot paper on 7 May #legend #GE2015 #Scotland 
@nickpdonovan yes possibly, things have really gotten to an "up in the air stage" if these scenarios are being sketched-out
100 years later, it's strange that to deny the Armenian Genocide remains illegal in France and official govt policy in Britain
@nickpdonovan to be fair Nick, that's kind of outdated thinking. Most of us in NI want to move beyond "peace process" thinking
8 yrs after Tony Blair stood down EdMili pitches Labour as foreign policy party. Given Tory record on EU not so hard 
Any desire to see NI MPs more influential after #GE2015  has been reduced now that I remember it'll be DUP MPs mostly #Wells
Wishing you a blessed St George's day: whether you're in England, Georgia, Catalonia.... #immigration #StGeorgesDay 
@AmChamEU_DHA we'll have to watch that space until then
@AmChamEU_DHA I thought it was certain to be scrapped?
@CardiffNorthLAB hi folks, I'm working in Cardiff 2day &amp; tmrw, can I lend a hand tmrw evening if I leave early? Thanks!
@haaretzcom don't think William of Orange ever "conquered" England, was invited then welcomed. Ireland on the other hand was another matter



@JeromeQuinn good work: @BelgiumGAA is at no. 3 in Europe
@Kilsally his party was one of the few standing in NI that was represented in the national event
#DUP #GE2015 manifesto calls for referendum on EU mem'ship but doesn't say which way they'd vote. Does Robinson still support membership?
This from @guardian 

@GreenPartyNI @TheGreenParty I didn't think so either. I was just interested in what their approach was. Have a nice day
@BNE_Group @ianjamesparsley  this is very good: any chance there is one for NI parties?
Nicola Sturgeon has made a direct appeal to NI voters. Is the SNP formally linked to @GreenPartyNI ? As it is England? Don't think it is
@JohnRentoul @ChairmanMoet that one strikes me as the one they're most likely to drop first if it comes to it

If you live in much of UK please register to vote in the general election and please do so by tomorrow. More info:

@BBCR4Feedback I noted lot of interest in "a history of ideas"- those who complained about it should try "something understood "
Good luck today to @LucyAndersonMEP @PDlondra @giannipittella @GlenisWillmott @LondonLabour from all of us @brusselslabour
Good luck to all @brusselslabour volunteers supporting @tdebbonaire with @bristolwestlab in Bristol this weekend! #VoteLabour
@Berlaymonster Do you prefer to walk on the other side of things &amp; enjoy very bright lights &amp; unimaginative names?

Y= The beer factory
@ianjamesparsley @dmcbfs I'm interested to know how far such policy will go, all sounds nice in election time but when it come to crunch...
@paddyhoey @smeeho7 yes although NI voters &amp; parties need to work-out what it is they want long-term &amp; present visions to voters &amp; govt
@ClaireHanna I thought the acting was superb
@smeeho7 worth a risk? Go-on! What could we loose?
@paddyhoey @smeeho7 I think time we moved beyond "peace process" &amp; towards 'long-term sustainable government process' or even sexier title!
@smeeho7 well I'm not so sure &amp; frankly I'm willing to see it tested
@smeeho7 do you really think it would make much difference?
@smeeho7 besides given what's happening in Republic of Ireland political scene right now that's just out-of-date reasoning
@smeeho7 like most NI voters i just don't buy that. Tory govt negotiates with Labour govt in Cardiff &amp; SNP govt in Edinburgh
@smeeho7 I really doubt that, besides it is time the wording "the peace process" was put to bed
@tim_brannigan an agreement DUP &amp; SinnFein agreed to in terms of spending with Westminster Gov't weeks ago, otherwise Stormont collapse
@BBCNewsnight better late than never I suppose....
@BBCNewsnight a burgeoning unionist foreign policy? Why not
@NewtonEmerson to be fair the Tories are in the same position
@WestminsterDUP I think that may well be the case. Pro-Union voters need to make sure they don't win the war only to loose the peace
@UndercoverMutha @BuzzFeedUKPol @BuzzFeedUK @5050Parliament seeing @Ed_Miliband not running to embrace these 3 makes me reassured #em4pm
@WestminsterDUP true, but learning to live with her in the room may be the Union's next big, long-term challenge
@LouiseMensch exactly! #voteLabour to deliver is from #EVEL #DeliverusfromEvel #nationalunity
No sense calling it #ChallengersDebate Miliband is only challenger, SNP is in government, they &amp; Plaid have no interest in forming govt
@flowri @AlStill will do! @lucy__tweet is coming too &amp; @jrwharris is around so let's do fun things!
@AlStill yeah, will be in the 'diff for a few days
@AlStill I might join you next Tuesday/ weds/ Thurs if you're up for it
@FiannaMan @cbolgerr austerity in the North &amp; "anything goes" populism in the South
@FiannaMan @cbolgerr just baffles me an "all-Ireland party" thinks people in South don't notice their in Govt in North #establishmentparty
@FiannaMan @cbolgerr she's a TD and has been in front line politics for years. How is she not an 'insider' ?!
@sunny_hundal Tories could offer them something as sweetener @ last minute &amp; they'd accept: as is their record in govt &amp; in negotiations
@sunny_hundal their line is they don't really want to be part of Govt as such, just  'confidence &amp; supply'
@johnjournalist don't you think the general election is enough of a poll ?
Here is @UKLabour position on Northern Ireland for #GE2015 
@ianjamesparsley I don't think you're the only one
Expert (&amp; former Tory candidate!) says Labour #GE2015 victory would be better for NI: probably 4 all devolved too 
@WSJ you left-out the NI parties, there are 18 seats there (likely 9 times UKIP + Greens total combined)


@GeneralBoles it shouldn't be only folks with diverse parentage who should have language skills
At Barcelona airport y'day I saw the #Germanwings flight to Düsseldorf boarding. Couldn't help think of all those lost in last month's crash
The decline in NI living standards in numbers:

@Berlaymonster @prospect_uk I knew closing the InfoPoint at European Parliament was a mistake!
@FlyingBrussels OK I spoke to the service Centre yesterday on the phone thanks
@MrTaytoNI I saw this jolly yellow character in a shop in Barcelona today; a relative of yours perhaps? 
@FlyingBrussels hi, I need to change my flight plans from next Sunday to today(Sunday)- Can you help me? It's really urgent! Thanks
@UKIP_NI ever seen how UKIP MEPs rank in similar European Parliament stats? Not much to suggest they'd be an improvement
@eububbIe what about the Northern Irish parties?
@ozkatz if SNP want a social-democratic line they won't be too afraid of putting-up taxes. They'll push for fiscal autonomy (even at cost)
@ozkatz they have an election to fight next year and &amp; they'll likely want to have something to show for their efforts down there
@ozkatz yes, that was 1 lasting legacy of Ireland on British politics. What impact SNP/ indyref will have, lucky I'm not a betting man...
@ozkatz indeed, they knew a de-fanged HoL couldn't strike down Home Rule bill. I wonder what would have happened otherwise?
@ozkatz yes, they certainly had a part in that, although I think rejection of Lloyd George's "People's Budget" had bit to do with that too
@ozkatz you think so? How so?
@ozkatz @b_judah yes, although they didn't hold the balance of power very often over the period, and there were much more of them
@ozkatz @b_judah not the same situation but parallels certainly, (Irish Party were never fully separatist)
@b_judah the question this time is how &amp; what sort of "UK government" we'll get as a result?
@yennimimi is the best they can do "he wants to be the Prime Minster" is that meant to destabilise someone running to be Prime Minister?
@b_judah but we'll still have a UK parliament at the end of it
@b_judah NI has always had a largely separate election


Ahead of the "Easter Rising" centenary next year I wonder will we hear more of these stories?

@RCorbettMEP addresses @labour4europe AGM "chances of accidental #Brexit are rather high" challenges ahead 
@ShappiKhorsandi Which venue?
@ShappiKhorsandi Woo-hoo!!
@ShappiKhorsandi Are you coming to Brussels anytime soon?
IS a DUP-Labour deal possible? History says maybe 
@CatholicHerald I appreciate @edwest attempt to deal with this, but not clear on his arguments. Consider 
Anyone remember the hilarious @Aiannucci spoof on election night '97 of a Labour-SinnFein deal? Have Tory strategists been watching that?
@JustinKaneC inclined 2 agree but some here hostile. Brussels is worried about credibility, deals, rules &amp; agreements.  All 2 b discussed!
@JustinKaneC Some here in Brussels have already called Tsipras "Putin's Trojan horse" would be an all-too-convenient alignment of foes
@ianjamesparsley Robinson makes Cameron look centrist, broad-minded &amp; generally leader-like. He would also get under skin of Sturgeon&amp;Wood
@ianjamesparsley That's also completely possible
Lobbying 4 DUP inclusion in #leadersdebates &amp; inventing #sinnfein - #labour axis? Cameron trying hard to get the DUP on his side already!
@bernardmccabe SDLP voting record infrequent &amp; often against Lab whip. Long &amp; Hermon take Labour whip. SF-deal would alienate all them
@bernardmccabe No noises from SF of change so Lab HQ must know smthng no1 else does &amp; how would they? For 4/5 seats? Plaîd would be cheaper
@bernardmccabe ....but alliance wi' party won't take seats or vote? Do you really think depths of bad political logic could be so plumbed?
@bernardmccabe well Labour thinking on NI is still in peace-process mind-set &amp; Blair OTR issues reinforce that
@bernardmccabe They weren't approaching SinnFein Ben, all Tory rumour. But you're right, Labour attitude to not standing in NI is outmoded


A real pleasure to speak to bright students from @LeuvenIrelandEU at the @IrelandRepBru today- EU leaders of the future perhaps?
I'm not their biggest fan but if this is true it's really a shame 
Is 'war on Wales' a misinterpretation of a planned move of #trident to Milford Haven? #PMQs

I certainly don't want 2 hear any DUP electioneering - but have yet to see any reason 2 exclude them if Plaîd &amp; SNP are in #leadersdebates
No outward sign of panic anywhere in Brussels today after #Syriza result. Only ominous signs armed troops still guarding most EU buildings

@EPPGroup Thanks
@plopezdepablo @Parliamonster "Fiscal paradise" sounds a bit too positive
@plopezdepablo @Parliamonster normally in English we say "tax haven"
@plopezdepablo @Parliamonster todo esta perfecto ahí? 
@Parliamonster @plopezdepablo I hear the Parliament may also have something to say about #Ceuta &amp; @Melilla too!
@EPPGroup is that really appropriate? #Gibraltar is in EU: as a responsible group you should not be beholden to outdated Spanish prejudice!
Glad #page3 has come to an end, we can also be thankful after #CharlieHebdo attacks that it was ended voluntarily-not banned or censored
@tnjharris @dodspeople thanks- interesting times in he history of 4th &amp; 5th national parties
@tnjharris @dodspeople Interesting, how does that compare to UKIP?
@tnjharris good point, any idea how many candidates GParty putting-up? I doubt anyone will be satisfied with the eventual decision
The Green Party's campaign 2B included in #leadersdebates  brings up same issue as SNP involvement. Its Eng &amp;Wales Greens not UK Greens

I would never have thought of Verviers as a hotbed of extremism (of any kind) sad news
@omid9 
@omid9 read it somewhere official-looking, I wouldn't be bothered only I wrote an article about it due online tomorrow #didiplaythatbadly?
@omid9 I prefer it your way anyway!
@omid9 Actually it's named after Charlie Brown from Peanuts

Now that the DUP have voted for a SinnFein speaker at Stormont will it mean an end to "curry my yoghurt" style pantomime tactics from both?
Bravo @RRSavignat pour cette belle image republicaine! Bravo surtout aux parisiens! #JeSuisCharlie #JeSuisAhmed

@CristinaOhq @LaCroixCom covered this pretty well. French Muslim leaders have expressed their horror &amp; condemnation

@sakibershad I think so too, but personally I don't think people should use 'ideology' as a naughty word. The British often do
@sakibershad doing something because you think it will benefit people's lives is an ideological act &amp; a good ideological one at that

@cbolgerr Thanks- is it any good?
@cbolgerr know anywhere in Belgium I can watch RTE's Charlie?

The phrase 'Deliver us from #EVEL " came to mind today. I hope after May 2015 we'll all be delivered

Just listened to Pope Francis address EuroParliament, telling it to pursue higher ideals &amp; goals - seems far removed from #Stormont today

Today some Tory MEPs voted for #TeamJunckerEU - some against- some abstained. Think that says a lot about how they are on Europe
@tfajon it's a pity you're not among them Tanja! Next time perhaps- for now keep up the good work in the EP!

#TeamJunckerEU

@ianjamesparsley indeed many cleavages in Scottish politics; football, ethnicity, East Coast/West Coast, Highlands/Islands all cut-through
@IainMcGill well done on all your work for a no vote Iain: the rest of the UK thanks you!
@BuzzFeedUK it's hardly brilliant- it's just British politics for Americans

@bselun must be to bathos what pathetic is to pathos? #everydayclassics
@ForeignAffairs would be possible (it existed before) but would be certainly nowhere near as credible &amp; would have different content
@RonanMcSherryUH well shall see. Take it easy
@RonanMcSherryUH they've had extensive devolution for over a decade- will get more if they vote no. Not all nations are self-governing
@RonanMcSherryUH they've never stopped being a nation
@zaksuff yes, me too. I would say we've gotten to the bottom of this issue but that might seem a little pithy
@zaksuff well I've learned something today if that's the case- one for the OED maybe?
@zaksuff was referring to the latter- you may well be right. Maybe there will be 2, different spellings after Independence
@zaksuff it's one of my preferred Scots words; another reason to say #nothanks
@zaksuff I would have spelled it 'jacksie' but your version is interesting; maybe I'll stick with from now-on
@zaksuff too late to make much difference by then- tbh I think the poles scared them a lot- if it's close then the need for change is clear
@jacobinmag he was magnificent today- a great social-democrat! #voteno
@AllisonMorris1 &amp; revenue London redistributes to Scots? (&amp;NI) as @ianjamesparsley says not good to sperate to keep your own gold
@AllisonMorris1 @ianjamesparsley forgive me if I see a contradiction in "they're all so socially-conscious" &amp; "they look after their own"
@DonalLyons I guess a double negative doesn't always sound positive?
@AllisonMorris1 @ianjamesparsley what a horrible thing to say
@AodhBC Fishguard could work say the Navy - so if you take the ferry from Cork you may run-into one

@CalJamieson well enjoy the rest of your evening! Take care
@CalJamieson so we're too Ulstermen arguing about Scotland?
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell well your separation politics are those I don't relate too- not after growing-up in Ulster
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell so why separation?
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell of you believe Salmond will deliver a Celtic- Sweden that's up to you but they've 7 years in power and well...
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell and Indy Scot will change that....how?
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell if you think I think you've been mislead
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell this isn't about Denmark
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell I don't believe in austerity-driven prosperity. In don't see any of SNP's policies targeting poverty
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell well if that works for you fine: #indyref not about that
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell let's hope not #racetothebottom
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell as a left-winger that's fine by me- Scotland's economy has a lot of public sector too
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell they may be the case but this isn't about Ireland
@CalJamieson @kevwodonnell honestly no
@OfficialIrishFA Come-on the ladies!
@TimMontgomerie please don't call Scotland that
@patronsaintofca @jamesdoleman I take yr point but SNP fronting it &amp; their leadership dealt with it (badly)- if you stay help us stay in!
@jamesdoleman that's the same as the YES campaign's EU policy
@euro_jonathan load of Vlaams Belang Goons with Scot flags at Schuman today. I'd love to see Scottish voters make them cry #bettertogether
@jacobinmag British trade unions also fear Scottish independence- and with good reason! #voteno

Racist Flemish separatists outside Scotland EU office in Brussels earlier 2day saying #voteyes No-one in #scotland or #indyref needs this!
@EUROLANG all No voters love Scotland too! Nas Fhearr Comhla! #bettertogether
@cbolgerr not everyone's heart &amp; head are out of sync...even in Scotland
@Hoopyghirl I'm disappointed you feel that way, but respect your right to opinion. I hope Labour can rebuild after referendum
@Hoopyghirl @LabourEoin well we shall see about that, good night &amp; take care
@wakeuptobreakup can I get involved from abroad?
@LabourEoin it seems the lesson of the #indyref is that it's better to have a Labour govt in Westminster &amp; a Labour govt in Holyrood
@EmmaMcIlveen hi there &amp; welcome to Brussels! You're at Clearly right? I work up at Schuman so we should meet soon -maybe this week or next?
@ForeignAffairs its far from the first

@PeterTatchell many of those result of previous Labour gov't-most their energy goes into Indy plans: nothing progressive about separation

@blairmcdougall @VoteNO2014_UKOK good luck!
"independence is fool’s gold" great riposte to the faux-progessive, self-hating wine of a certain environmentalist 
@Yes4indy we shall see- it was certainly a successful #commonwealth games in Glasgow. Enjoy the rest of the campaign
@Yes4indy I don't think there is any question that you 'can' do it - of course it can. Geldof &amp; I (&amp; many others) hope you choose not to
@Yes4indy luckily it isn't! Hopefully a 'no' vote will help to promote wider devolution
@Yes4indy well Geldof moved-back and Obama seems 2 visit often-enough so it clearly isn't so bad. But down to Scots voters in the end
@Yes4indy well he lives in London (where I think he's been for decades) so wouldn't be any need for that- though I think he's not a citizen
If you don't count the boomtown rats Geldof has made some good points #indyref #nothanks

@EuroCelt it's a niche career posting; more hard work &amp; less pay than many options available to former heads of govt/state
@EuroCelt well, many sometime after they've left office as an 'elder statesman' type role - interesting with Tusk as he's still in office

@ben_acheson do you have the courage to tell @adi_peltz  you're from Ballynahinch?
@Shane1Griffin hope so but whatever happens the UK constitution needs an update, may not all be hypothetical. Eg devolution, trident etc
@Shane1Griffin it also features certain English people who may not encourage Scots to vote to stay-in!
@Shane1Griffin it's not great, to be fair it does feature Welsh nationalists &amp; some Englishmen (only men) who would happily see Scotland go
@Shane1Griffin well I think it's designed to be from the rest of the UK's point of view...it's typically pessimistic

@monkibusinessa1 of course my incredulity is bound-up inextricably in the fact that at an emotional level I just couldn't bear to face it
@monkibusinessa1 funny I was just talking to my girlfriend, I'm worried she wants to leave me...when you say those things it sounds the same
@monkibusinessa1 but do you really imagine you'll be better-off outside the UK? I can't imagine that
@monkibusinessa1 but do you really believe conditions for the worse-off will change for the better in an Indy Scotland?

I just added my name to the #letsstaytogether campaign to keep our UK family together. Join me here 
@monkibusinessa1 precisely, and more
@billybragg still much harder to get progressive majority in rest of UK with pr or not- can't imagine how it would be worth it
@monkibusinessa1 I don't think so, all options are on the table then #weshallsee
@electionlit that poster still hangs in my local pub...then again it is called De Valera's
@OwenJones84 I still get the absolute creeps thinking about it to this day

@billybragg I think in the bigger picture a Balkanised Britain with potentially permanent Tory govt in WM would defeat a lot
@billybragg we all know system needs fixing but to support Scots Indy in order to bring it about seems self-defeating
@billybragg I think you lost perspective here Billy, and some of your progressive credentials too
@IWA_Wales @SeimonBrooks but is there really a rise?
@NewStatesman @RufusHound I think @ben_acheson has been doing this lately- see his new video at @diff_angle
@BankersUmbrella ah John McBlain, good memories and glad to hear he's still at it- maybe you could use some of his material in your blog?
@BankersUmbrella nicest accent in Europe, if not the Englishspeaking world. most of my peers are jealous, perhaps that's what your feeling?
@EuroHagan or at least the option
Time for a left-wing alternative in #NI #progress #nipolitics #fairness #1nation 
@TheProgressives don't you have an Instagram account too?
@brosie8 to boldly go where no (Irish) man has gone before
May you have eternal rest.
#WW1
Proud day to be in Mons #lightsout #100yearson #neveragain #irishatwar #WW1centenary 
In #Mons watching @CWGC ceremony 
The #Gaza issue viewed from #northernireland - very sharp 
Fabians &amp; @ecfr  say @UKLabour must seize agenda on EU, or risk 'Brexit'

In all my years I've never let AA Gill persuade me on anything. Today's shameful piece in the @TheSTMagazine is no different #bettertogether
@OgGarland sorry "good day" tomorrow.... Too many shandys for me tonight
@OgGarland well here's hoping! Have a gold day tomorrow
@OgGarland why not "Gays for peace"?
@Ed_Miliband @UKLabour I've worked with Sarah, she's a great colleague, a great local representative and will make a great local MP!
Enjoyed this on Russian soldier’s ‘Ukraine selfies’ &amp; art in modern war #selfie #instagram #modernsoldier 

Timothy Garton-Ash is pragmatic and hard-headed here: deserves to be read: #europe #ww1@100 #ukraine #putin #Merkel 

@NS_Culture read this last week; it was dreadful then &amp; hasn't improved. How do you explain popularity of the Edinburgh Tattoo year on year?
@bartoncreeth a good article- but there has always been a Jewish element to mainstream left in British politics (I used to work there)
Disgraceful! To think it's only few weeks since the Jewish murders in Brussels 
@CDMStalfordDUP @EmmetMcDB we shall see, sons of former leaders can hold strong though...as North Antrim would suggest
@CDMStalfordDUP @EmmetMcDB why do you think Bootle is a stronghold? Same reason or something else?
@CDMStalfordDUP and North Antrim?
Can't help but spot the #irony in many folks here calling for #boycott on Israeli goods and doing so on a smart-phone, part-made in #Israel
The spectacle of SNP members posing as @UKLabour members is 1 new &amp; disturbing aspect of the #indyref #dishonesty 

#IndyRef #BetterTogether #NoThanks #VoteNo
Seems unfair that @Matalan are owned by multi-millionaires but haven't paid a single penny to survivors of Rana Plaza collapse. Why?

@prospect_uk "Accelerated dying" ? Isn't it "assisted dying" ?- both sound rather terrifying (and wrong)
@jongittings @mjshilliday Sinn Fein has had MPs for quite some time -he's probably first LibDem to be fair
@ben_acheson @JakeOKane well that's much the same for many EU leaders in this city
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson not that I'm calling you anti-Semitic or anything but its a beast that's alive &amp; well and needs little provoking
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson 3 innocent Jews murdered here 6 weeks ago, some **** attacked a synagogue in B'fast. Anti-semetism hasn't gone away
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson comparing people to Nazis only dehumanises = a barrier to the kind of understanding that could help end conflict
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson he's got you there Ben
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson you are at your best when you satirise but your comments yesterday served only to de-humanise
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson don't you consider it a duty on your part to moderate your language in a difficult time?
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson ...I unfortunately am unable to prevent a lot of this madness in Israel + Gaza today but you have a lot of followers
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson with respect Jake I don't think you're aware of the work I've done in regards to Middle East peace process
(remember #BringBackOurGirls or #Kony2012? Nothing happened)


Kein Vergeben, kein Vergessen! 
@JakeOKane @ben_acheson I was worried about possibly anti-semetic rhetoric yesterday-then someone attacked a synagogue in Belfast
@JakeOKane but do you honestly think their cause is served by your kind of inflammatory rhetoric?
@JakeOKane I respect your right to criticise Israel/IDF as you see fit but I don't think comparisons to the Nazis are ever appropriate
@JakeOKane you shouldn't compare Israelis to the 3rd Reich... You just shouldn't
Having worked on EU trade issues longer than #UKIP's MEP Steven Wolffe it's very hard to believe anything he says on the matter #bbcdp

Important reading 

@b_judah given the horrible incident at a synagogue at the week it seems reasonable: but yes, banning protests: never ideal
@BelTel while there is some merit to some of this- it ignores how the Arab states have treated the Palestinians, no Irish parallel

Big numbers at Rally for life in Belfast this weekend 
"Assisted dying is the final triumph of market capitalism" strong stuff from @giles_fraser 
In the midst of it all there is humanity /www.timesofisrael.com/slain-israeli-teens-uncle-consoles-murdered-palestinians-father/
Saddened to hear of the deaths of 3 Israeli teens held captive by Hammas, May peace be upon their souls #nomore

Chloe Dewe Mathews's Shot at Dawn: a moving photographic memorial


This isn't Northern Ireland: it's Brazil! But it's all the same to me! #notbrazil #norniron #gawaontour 
@PortadownTimes1 @Portadownfc was proud to represent #portadown yesterday at the #fifafanzone in Rio 
10 mths ago this went on me to Luxembourg- 2day to the Maracana. We're not Brazil we're #NornIron but all same to me 
Good luck to all volunteers at @stcbrussels who begin big volunteer week 2014 today! Looking forward to joining you later this week
Sarajevo marks the 100 yr anniversary of an assassination 
Are they 2nd guessing the result of the #indyref @ Amsterdam airport? 
Great to hear EC Gaelic club planning a guided tour of the Ypres salient this weekend 

HM Queen visited Crumlin Rd gaol today- when a sovereign goes to a prison does she stay there at her own pleasure?.....I'll get my coat
Glad the royal couple are being warmly welcomed in Belfast today- if only migrant workers and other decent folk were so welcomed as well!

@PDUrope do you think there is a 'final answer?' Perhaps another chapter in a long history?
@PDUrope it's nowhere near the same
@LesleyRiddoch same thing
@PortadownTimes1 U wish them a great trip: they're not the only ones from Portadown on their way to Rio! #gettingexcited

Unusual story- likely points to a declining level of understanding about Ulster issues in today's Fleet Street

Irish press suggesting that Cameron's alternative to #Juncker is Ireland's Enda Kenny 
Relieved to hear that Michael #Schumacher has left hospital: glad to have you back with us!
Powerful stuff on #sinnfein 
No more anti-homeless #spikes at #tesco!! 
@danielrhamilton even with its shady components? No idea how this will play-out in EP. Cameron still excluded from EPP pre-summit pow-wows
@JeromeQuinn ever seen a Gaelic football team from Brittany? Barely an Irishman in half a dozen teams
Any truth in the rumours that #sinnfein are trying to join the #europeanparliament centre-left grouping the @TheProgressives ? Doubt it
@Glinner "should traffic wardens be armed?" Is what he said (right before falling into a toilet)
Absolutely gutted to hear of the passing of Rik Mayall, one of British comedy's greats of the last 30 years
@davidwhite020 yeah- it is unusual. Probably that the campaign has really hotted-up. 100 days to go
@davidwhite020 it is Wimbledon very soon I don't want my support for Andy Murray this year to be conflated with any support for Indy

@JulieMddlkp How are things otherwise? - happy with the European election results?
@JulieMddlkp unless my Dutch is as bad as it always was this is just a shameful attempt to denigrate Mother Teresa's legacy to no-one's gain
@JulieMddlkp ironic (or perhaps a little warped) to venerate the late Christopher Hitchens at the expense of Mother Teresa?
@JulieMddlkp link doesn't work - I very much doubt it was worth reading anyway- disgraceful how some try to sully her reputation

Please RT. Via :@AmnestyNI 
@SpectatorLive easy to say Juncker is a "biz-as-usual" candidate- but Tory ECR group didn't field a candidate so same could be said of many
@SpectatorLive I really don't think that the Callanan Commissioner idea has any traction anywhere other than ConHome
@FEPS_Europe I'll look forward to that- thanks!
@FEPS_Europe sounds very interesting- will there be any publication to follow?
@jonworth @LukeReuters imagine they're fixed on Salmond &amp; #indyref for the moment- though Cameron can't have helped with his prevarications
As I'm job-hunting I will take inspiration from Prince Felipe- Enhorabuena su majestad! Y suerte! #abdication 
@yennimimi you never know! Sounds like a plan!
Does anyone know where I can buy a world-cup wall-chart (preferably in English) in Brussels? #worldcupfever
@flowri potato salad was a crazy idea admitted. Next time go for something toast-related and work your way up #toast
I remember when folks in #NorthernIreland used to get-up early or travel miles just to be offended. Now they just use twitter
@flowri life is difficult - but don't worry twitter forgives you

Good luck to my pal @Shane1Griffin in his bid to become councillor in his native Celbridge: he'd be a great man for job! #le14 #votelabour
Despite sunshine &amp; jazz coming through my window I've just heard that my hometown now has it's first #UKIP councillor &amp; now decidedly cranky
@AaronPatrick28 happy PBPA are in Belfast but down in South-with projections are while Island could be a left-free zone in terms of MEPs
@AaronPatrick28 but bad results for Irish Labour Party across the South, &amp; 1 PBPA in Belfast, 1 in Northwest, hardly good day for the left
@AaronPatrick28 how so?

Proud to be with @SPDEuropa &amp; @spdde in #Aachen to support @MartinSchulz in tomorrow's European election #EP2014 
Just heard the horrifying news that 3 people have been killed in a shooting at the Jewish museum in Brussels. Just sickened
On my way to Aachen with @PES_PSE activists &amp; @brusselslabour members to support @MartinSchulz #knockthevote 
@richardwaghorne no matter, I feel it's fairly safe to say a forgiveable offence...like being a fellow I traveller with the SWP
@richardwaghorne to be fair Richard isn't "weird cult" a tautology?
@ben_acheson @EPElections @Europarl_EN not even that night we had the Ulster fry?
@roger_scully looks like it will to make an impact. UKIP likely to add a small handful to it's current 1 councillor. Turnout around 50%
@roger_scully on respective flanks. Alliance vote strong in certain areas. Some independents on nationalist side elected. New NI21 party....
@roger_scully a bit early to tell.DUP &amp; SF look like staying top dog among their respective sides. No collapse for either UUP or SDLP (1/2)
@alonorbach @AlizonMoore @ArjunMittra well done!
@PeterGiffen well keep-up the enthusiasm none-the-less!
@PeterGiffen I'd be happy to stick labels for your leaflets again next time....just maybe a different hairdo then ;) seriously ,well done!
@PeterGiffen Well done! Don't be discouraged, you can be pleased with your effort-now you're entitled to a rest!
@ClaireHanna well done! Congratulations
@alonorbach good luck!
