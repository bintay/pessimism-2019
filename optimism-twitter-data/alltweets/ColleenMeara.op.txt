@wordbeeps I guess anytime something repugnant happens in the political world, instead of addressing it,we should all just shrug, "politics"
@wordbeeps @SUNBryanpass mmm so you think "politics" has a generally positive connotation, and shouldn't be critically discussed? Okay.
When an IDF-supporter says they're getting their news "right at the source" &amp; proves it by linking to an article from Front Page mag. Yikes
"Critics too quick to pile on Calgary-Bow MLA-designate Deborah Drever" -  @SUNBryanpass 
George Zimmerman very much needs to be kept separate from the majority of the population until (if/when) he is a truly changed person.
The prison system as it stands, should be abolished. But that doesn't mean dangerous folk shouldn't be prevented from hurting more people.
I see George Zimmerman is continuing his legacy of being a prime example of the absolute dangers of white supremacist policing &amp; justice

Ugh. Just another example of repacking misogyny and oppression as "sexy, choice-y, human rights-y empowerment!" 
This is why education is *so* important for dispelling harmful myths about rape, most crucially that it is ever, in any way, her fault.

@emzeymp gonna just save that for the next time someone tweets at me that I must hate women if I support the abolition of prostitution.
@emzeymp thanks for sharing that. What a powerful speech.
@MeghanEMurphy @emzeymp sooo great. That HuffPo article on the other hand was just so patronizing towards disabled people. Disappointing.

@matness it seems the fear of being labelled "conservative" is quite coercive, and it supersedes the importance of critical evaluation.

@matness thank you so much for this. New fan.
A really important read re: #JianGhomeshi by @matness 
We hear their voices so rarely, meanwhile "CHOICE" &amp; "sex-pos" liberal feminists tell us commodification of female sexuality is a good thing
Arguments that prostitution &amp; human trafficking are two entirely different things are ignorant of the everyday realities of trafficked women
Re: that last tweet. Unfortunately it's not surprising that brothel owners w/ legal licenses were involved in sex trafficking. It's linked.
@chenyihans preeeeeach!
@femfreq yesyesyesyesyesyesyes
Just because you LIKE doing something doesn't mean you need to reframe it as ~a feminist act~ or insist that it subverts male violence jfc
We can all do so, so much better than this. #VAW is not suddenly ok because SEX! &amp; CONSENT! Whatever happened to being a decent human being
Must we twist everything into ~a feminist act~ or a "human right," just because we like doing it? Do we stop caring bc there was consent?
Once again @MeghanEMurphy cuts through the mud. All bets are NOT off after consenting, &amp; you can't consent to abuse. 
@fugitivephilo it's really hard when the people we look up to and enjoy are accused of such things. Felt that way about Bill Cosby.
@fugitivephilo making big decisions in a time of stress is not recommended, that's for sure. I'll be watching with a critical eye for now.
@fugitivephilo couldn't agree more.
@fugitivephilo yeah I'm with you on waiting to hear more. Just wish the immediate response wasn't so steeped in a disbelief of women.
@fugitivephilo but for now his story doesn't look good &amp; I'm pretty disappointed the knee-jerk response has been to call the women liars.
@fugitivephilo CBC does have a hist of being uncomfortable w the public finding out about the sexual exploits of their hosts ie Sook-Yin Lee
@fugitivephilo right but that wasn't what I was talking about. Also I have a hard time believing he was fired for being into BDSM.
What happened to believing women when they tell us their experiences? Is the fear of being branded "sex negative" more pressing? #RantOver
I am disturbed (but not surprised) by the amount of support Jian has received. Already the assumption is the women are opportunistic liars.
BESIDES, the women accusing him probably just hit themselves in the face with hammers. Haven't you seen #GoneGirl?! Art imitating life, no?
But let's just all jump on board to support him, lest we be branded as "sex negative." I mean, what could be worse 4 our feminism than that?
#JianGhomeshi punched women in the face while having sex with them. They are coming forward to say it was not consensual.
Always loved @petermansbridge. Great work today! 
This applies to SO MUCH right now: "Commodification of feminism is not empowerment..."

@waitinggirl3 they don't offend me. Pimps and johns do.
@TheSnappyBoss I bet it was!I'm a firm believer that social media is making discourses more horizontal.Don't even both w/ reg news anymore.
@blk_bk I'm actually a prison-abolitionist. I don't support criminalization of SWs!
@TheSnappyBoss this is true, and so grateful for the Internet for that! Very pro-Palestine. Another example is Ferguson.
@blk_bk  I hope C36 helps SWs. I accept that I might be wrong. I am listening. I do stand behind believing white privilege is pervasive.
@TrancewithMe @GlasgaeLauraLee in reference to that.
@TrancewithMe @GlasgaeLauraLee I am sorry if it came across that I thought she was privileged for something other than whiteness. It was
@TrancewithMe @GlasgaeLauraLee I haven't blocked anyone &amp; still want to listen.The tweet that has been referred to was about white privilege
@GlasgaeLauraLee I agree. But the most oppressed people don't have smartphones and twitter accounts.
@GlasgaeLauraLee b/c I absolutely have no experience. Just been more swayed by one side &amp; angry about VAW.
@GlasgaeLauraLee I was only referring to relative whiteness. She is much more qualified than myself &amp; I do want to listen. I'll keep trying
@Dollymopp I really want to, but I don't think all current SWs have a voice right now. I wish they did.
@GlasgaeLauraLee like I said, no one is representative. But I also don't believe all former SWs trying to reduce demand are liars.
@GlasgaeLauraLee so, to be clear, she is absolutely qualified to speak, but she doesn't speak for all SWs. No one does. That was my point.
@GlasgaeLauraLee it's not a card; it's a reality.I don't think her perspective is invalid,however it doesn't mean I have to ignore other SWs
@Dollymopp right, but white privilege is pervasive and is not removed from prostitution.
@TrancewithMe my argument is that white privilege exists everywhere, even in prostitution. I never, not once, said SW couldn't be white.
4chan is just “a cyber cesspool functioning as an incubator for misogyny”. - @femfreq 
@mechanima calling out whiteness is NEVER out of line. Ever.
@mechanima sorry you are "above" critically analyzing your whiteness &amp; relative privilege. 
@mechanima surely you must know former SWs fall on either side of the argument. You don't get to demonize me for agreeing with one side.
@mechanima I have absolutely none. I came to feel the way I do after reading other women's account of prostitution. I don't devalue them.
@mechanima but how can you, a white woman, consider yourself representative of prostitutes? Inspect your privilege.
@mechanima but we both know there are people who feel like you do and those who feel as I do. I'm not going to continue twitter debating you
@mechanima I've been listening. You choose not to listen to the voices of women who fought tooth &amp; nail to escape prostitution.
@mechanima Right, because things are so great for prostitutes where there is full legalization.
@mechanima Nope. Just said that if I am wrong, you are welcome to come back and say "I told you so."
@mechanima Look, I disagree. But if the bill truly gets passed, and it becomes worse out there for SW, then I will personally apologize.
@mechanima If #C36 actually makes things worse for prostitutes, I will be the first to admit I was wrong. I sincerely believe it will help.
@mechanima is raped, she can go to the police and win, because the john/pimp was already doing something illegal.
@mechanima nice straw man. Your agency rhetoric obviates the millions of women who suffer under prostitution. At least now if a prostitute..
@mechanima what warm fuzzy feeling is that? I don't think you understand my position one bit. Continue to demonize me if you want.
@mechanima right, so now I'm an evil witch casting spells and plagues on people. When did it become evil to disavow male purchase of women?
@mechanima I said justice for women is a long way off. My position is strictly that I do not believe men have the right to buy &amp; sell girls.
I don't believe men should have the right to buy &amp; sell girls. I also don't believe #C36=problem solved. But the msg to men needs to be sent
@mechanima they deserve, &amp; that's a long way off.Don't swap my anger at johns&amp;pimps for animosity towards prostitutes. Simply untrue.
@mechanima I don't want to prey on the most vulnerable.That's not fair.I recognize abolition isn't possible until women receive the justice
This is neoliberalism's effect on feminist politics. Full stop.
Alan Young thinks commodification is "something weird to fight," and that's about all I need to hear from him. #C36

@MeghanEMurphy count on a dude 2 jump in &amp; mansplain feminism on yr VO piece like "You missed that the Pistorius judge was a woman! GOTCHA!"
who are without her relative privilege and the choices SHE had but they don't.
@tentozen yeah,I mean the function of privilege is to be invisible to those who benefit from it, so this person really was unaware of those
@tentozen and unfortunately some feminists seem to be forgetting that in their "listen to sex workers" mantra.
@tentozen yeah.Unfortunately in the pro-prostitution circles, only women (and usually white women) who have chosen sex work will get a voice
@tentozen same. I would really like to hear from someone why they feel this way. Genuinely.
@tentozen it's so nice to talk to someone who feels the same way! I've been really disturbed by the double-standard in this lately. Madness.
@tentozen as a welcome mat for human trafficking, as much as pro-sex work advocates would like to deny that.
@tentozen into it. Prostitutes who "choose" enable an environment where selling your body becomes a viable option for girls, and also serves
@tentozen exactly my thoughts. And I don't think the rights of women who choose to be prostitutes trump the rights of women who are coerced
@tentozen than sexual products for male consumption. It seems simple to me but so many feminists disagree.
@tentozen I don't want to struggle for a world where men and boys think it's okay to purchase women. I want women to see themselves as more
I'd be happy to live in a world where neither exists. That's my utopia. But some feminists' utopia include full legalization of prostitution
@tentozen I agree completely. My primary confusion is how Miss America is awful &amp; archaic but prostitution is empowering.
@tentozen yeah. I just sincerely do not understand, but sites like Feministing seem to hold that opinion, and like, a LOT of feminists.
Would sincerely appreciate someone who feels this way explaining why it's okay for johns to sexually objectify women but not #MissAmerica
Feminists who want full legalization of prostitution but are horrified by #MissAmerica's sexual objectification of women are confusing

"In the context of the exchange of sexual services for consideration between consenting adults"Bruce Ryder's ridiculous fancy-speak for rape
Newsflash: being pro #C36 and pro consensual sex b/w adults are not mutually exclusive. It's not that complicated.
2/2 and women feel that their greatest value is in renting their bodies for sex. But yeah I'm prob just sex negative, that must be it.
1/2 It's not consent; it's exploitation made invisible thru the mechanisms of patriarchal society where men feel entitled to women's bodies
Another claim of #NotAllJohns &amp; that paid sex is ever consensual#C36 “@globepolitics:How to fix the prostitution law

@emlaughsallot88 just because you say "oh yeah it is" doesn't make it true.
@emlaughsallot88 FYI, I don't support full criminalization. Only criminalization of buyers and pimps. NOT sex workers.
@emlaughsallot88 no. I do not believe it is wrong. I believe it is wrong to PAY for sexual favours, so yes includes janes.
@emlaughsallot88 the consensual sex I advocate for has no single giver &amp; receiver.It's not a one-way street.It's done TOGETHER out of desire
@emlaughsallot88 I don't think consensual sex is something you give away. That implies the men always take and the women always give.
@emlaughsallot88 you keep insisting I find sex workers immoral/bad females, which is untrue. I don't know how many times I have to say it.
@emlaughsallot88 yeah I'm against renting women's bodies. I don't see any connection to sex w your spouse, unless it's marital rape.Explain?
@emlaughsallot88 classic "you must just hate sex" argument. Nope. Just believe in true consent. Consent for money is exploitation.
@emlaughsallot88 because they think they have the right to purchase women's bodies.
@emlaughsallot88 nope. I see johns as deplorable &amp; exploiting women. Your accusations are unfounded and out of control. Total straw man.
@emlaughsallot88 please point out where I said that or get out of my mentions.
@emlaughsallot88 I def can't get down with that. I'm also super anti-capitalist, pro-Palestine, so I don't think we'll agree on much.
@emlaughsallot88 Your #NotAllMen suggests you care more about the rights of men to purchase sex than the right of women not to be exploited
@emlaughsallot88 You're conflating my "looking down upon" johns with looking down upon sex workers. Couldn't be further from the truth.
@emlaughsallot88 I disagree that reducing stigma would reduce VAW. I think when men feel entitled to women's bodies that's a social problem.
@emlaughsallot88 I'm referring to other places in the world (i.e. Australia) where fully decrim hasn't produced necessarily safer conditions
have lost said respect after seeing how they treat you. V disappointing &amp; discouraging. You have my #solidarity, Meghan. @MeghanEMurphy
@MeghanEMurphy the shit you have to deal with online is unreal. I hope you feel supported in equal measure. So many women that I respect...
qualifying some women as sexual commodities capable of bringing in johns and others as "past their prime" or "unmarketable."
Not all women who currently work in the sex trade will be offered positions in brothels. Legalization would only create a two-tier system...
There is no evidence to suggest that reducing stigma and full legalization will create safer conditions for the most vulnerable women. #C36
2/2 to rent a woman's body.To me, that's not consent; it's rape. And marginalized women suffer too greatly in the sex trade to legitimize it
1/2 Imo prostitution is VAW. I don't expect prostitutes to have a uniform experience, but I also reject the idea than a man had a right...
Yet being a prostitution abolitionist &amp; supporter of #C36 somehow makes me a bigot. Ok. Um since when was respectfully disagreeing a no-no?
I thought it was pretty common knowledge among feminists that we are not monolith &amp; we often express our feminist politics differently, ...

@Rushlimbang most child molesters were abused as children. I support their rehabilitation, not their murder or imprisonment.
@Rushlimbang I think they did, but maybe we just saw different posts/talked to different people.
@Rushlimbang my main problem with the GoT rape scene is that many don't view it as rape, and that worries me a lot.
@Rushlimbang ah! My brother read those wheel of time books &amp; I've been meaning to as well. Need more hours in the day.
@Rushlimbang I haven't gotten around to reading them. I agree the story is oft highly problematic, but can spur some important discussion.
@Rushlimbang I think it's good to be critical, even of the things we enjoy. Excusing something of evaluation bc we like it is blindness.
@Rushlimbang actually people have been plenty upset about that in the past. That doesn't mean discussion abt the rape scene is unwarranted.
It's not that complicated folks. Anything but an enthusiastic "YES!" is a resounding "NO." So, multiple pleas of no/stop/don't = RAPE. #GoT
Apparently director Alex Graves, and numerous others, didn't think it was rape either. #GoT

@Success1st1 I think medically-sound sex education is more effective than teaching abstinence, or "success b/f sex."

@Whelp177 poor excuse for bringing up rape, btw. You're so predictable it hurts. Lol.
@Whelp177 I'm not going to try to have a reasonable conversation with an unreasonable person; I'm sure you're capable of using google.
@deirdrepike great photo! :)
@Whelp177 not sure why you're bringing rape into this other than to assume you've run out of ideas.
@Whelp177 #staystrong
@Whelp177 sigh. You disappoint me. Come back when you've thought of a real attack. G2g for now, but I'll check back later! #youcandothis
@Whelp177 oh, come onnnn, don't act so frazzled! You're not going soft on me, are you? You've gotta have something better than that!
@Whelp177 you can't offend me, lol. Or maybe you can I dunno, try again? Let's see what you've got. :)
@Whelp177 that reward will sour as the decades rage on, as more &amp; more Suey's emerge, as you feel your power increasingly slipping away...
@Whelp177 maybe if you keep tweeting about Suey he will personally thank you or something.
@Whelp177 well maybe if you've just joined the party that's all you've seen, but do get back to me when Colbert notices YOU. ;)
@Whelp177 lol. This is clearly hard for you. Did you wave at reality when it passed you by?
@Whelp177 you're losing because no one is listening to you the way they are listening to Suey. You are losing bc she's making change, yr not
@Whelp177 funny, I thought that was what you were doing.  Anyways, keep on doing nothing! Sad sad sad.
@Whelp177 cute, but I don't need an education from someone who's incapable of making change.
@Whelp177 there, there. I know the reality of your powerlessness must be difficult. Can you believe you're losing to a girl?! (Suey)
@Whelp177 so keep tweeting hate &amp; feeling smug. It'll entertain you, I'm sure, but it won't change anything. You are futility, embodied.
@Whelp177 And there's nothing you can do about it. The power you are accustomed to, evidenced by your entitled attitude, doesn't exist here.
@Whelp177 but that's just it. She IS making a difference. A difference you will never make. This is the reality.
@Whelp177 stuck with that stewing hate until your last day! Exactly the sweet sweet justice I was referring to. You're not changing a thing.
@Whelp177 ah, yes! Let that hate stew inside you! Bc tweeting about it isn't going to change anything (sorry!) which means it's just you...
@Whelp177 nothin' against them expect when they hold higher positions than you at work! ;)
@Whelp177  “are in positions equal or above” you. How embarrassing! It’s almost as if you and every bigot like you is losing or something.
@Whelp177 Keep fighting the good fight for that white supremacist patriarchal capitalist society by whining on twitter that POC at your work
@Whelp177 Cool, glad you spend at least some of your spare time not calling people cunts and pretending white men are oppressed.
@queerdesires feel better soon! Just recovering from 2+ weeks of sickness myself. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@Whelp177 and to think, you are stuck with yourself for the rest of your life! Oh the sweet, sweet justice.
@Whelp177 you enjoy being you!

I like "minority world," but it seems so closely worded to "minority groups," and clearly they are not referring to the same populations.
Suggestions most welcome for other phrases that mean the same thing as "developed nation" without implying we are some sort of pinnacle.
I really prefer to avoid using the term "developed nation," but sometimes saying "Global North country" over and over sound too try-hardy...
