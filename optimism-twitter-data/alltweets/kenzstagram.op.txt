Completely elated right now<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I'll gladly be the biggest "bitch" out there if it means I get to speak my mind and defend those I love along with myself.
The worst is when a girl defends herself and it's seen as the girl being a "bitch" or "bitchy"
Newsflash: standing up for ourselves is something that girls have been told to refrain from doing, but that doesn't mean we aren't going to.
So sad that it's seen as "weird" or "annoying" when girls and women stand up for themselves.

All of this pain spread all over your face, all I wanna do is help you out of this place...
I am so excited for comp season I miss it so much
        So Saturday 
   Much relax
            Very sleep in
        Such tired
<SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><HEAR-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
spending my snow day playing left 4 dead and watching the UAN tour DVD with @courtcarter6
I'm trying my best but it's still not enough
I have the best friends in the world<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
       So chi
  Much speed
        Very snow
Wow 
The people who said they would always be there are only there when it's convenient to them. That's not friendship that's bullshit.
DO YOU EVER WANT TO HELP BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY YOU CAN SO YOU JUST SIT THERE FEELING LIKE CRAP BECAUSE YOU'RE PRACTICALLY USELESS
stop          stop          stop          stop
There are very few things that make me as happy as seeing my dance girls
Still not mentally prepared for TFiOS to come out... Nope I'm already tearing up.
DO YOU EVER SEE SOMEONE AND YOURE LIKE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM BUT YOURE TOO SCARED TO APPROACH THEM YEAH ITS PAINFUL
        Such chicken
    Very nugget
               So crispy 
Happy birthday @Harry_Styles <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I STILL HAVE THE "RUNE" ON MY WRIST @courtcarter6
@MEGA__blocks you lil shit
If there isn't a new Left 4 Dead released in the near future I may just go insane.
I LOVE MICHAEL CERA SO MUCH IT HURTS
Reuniting with my fave this Saturday @MEGA__blocks so exited!!! <SPARKLING HEART><SPARKLING HEART><SPARKLING HEART>
I JUST BOUGHT A SONG CALLED "Ladies Want to Shower with Jamie Campbell Bower For an Hour" WHAT HAS MY LIFE COME TO
Just because it's not important to you doesn't mean it's not important to others. Don't make fun of what makes people happy.
The fact that you feel the need to make up petty rumours about others to feel better about yourself just makes me sick. You're pathetic.
That is so creepy and so weird on so many levels
Idek
The worst part is waiting.
So excited to watch the Kenner dance recital on Thursday and be reunited with my ram family! Can't wait to see you guys miss you so much<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<FACE THROWING A KISS>
Let's play do you loathe my existence or do you like me
You make me so mad I want to slam my head into a wall and throw myself off of a cliff  (◡‿◡✿)
My hobbies include not wearing my glasses for long periods of time then wearing them again and freaking everyone out
Don't judge someone based on what you think you know because really, you don't know.
Wanting to repeatedly smash my head against a wall right about now
Surprise, surprise I have once again messed up. Good job Kenz, good job<PENSIVE FACE>
I'm oddly obsessed with crime shows and learning about the stories behind murders I sweAR IM NOT A PYSCO ITS JUST INTERESTING OKAY
ZOE'S HOME AND I AM EMOTIONALLY UNPREPARED. A WEEK HAS FELT LIKE A YEAR! SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU @zoe_baird1 WHY AM I STILL TYPING IN ALL CAPS
The music from @ohdaughter is simply the best. Can't get enough of this music!

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!<FATHER CHRISTMAS><WRAPPED PRESENT><CHRISTMAS TREE>
Beyoncé is the best never try to tell me otherwise because I will shove her new album down your throat until you agree

Three way facetiming more like no
snazzy
I want to explain what I feel/think but my thoughts get all jumbled in my head and they come out wrong and it always gets me in trouble.
Had a great day with my girls @princesshansnah and @zoe_baird1 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
You sir, are an idiot.
In an "Only Ed Sheeran can make me happy right now" kind of mood

Emotionally exhausted.
Worst. Night. Ever.
What the hell are you laughing about? You're his second choice.
well this day has gone from bad to worse.
Joking about cancer is not okay. Pretending to have cancer is not okay. And you being an ass hole about it is definitely not okay.
It never ceases to amaze me just how low some people stoop to hurt others to make themselves feel better. Get a life.
s/o to mama Carter for being literally the sweetest person ever

Do not buy me things bc there is a 100% chance I will feel really guilty and tell you to take it back bc I'm not worthy
