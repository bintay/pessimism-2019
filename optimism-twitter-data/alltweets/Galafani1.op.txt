As you know, anything&amp;everything can be defended. And @kfcsa #kfc has found the most creative lie and ingenious spin doctoring by saying...
Health department must come down hard and harsh on @kfcsa. They can't just get off the hook that easily. #kfc
Unless of course @kfcsa MD refers to "US" as animals to be fed. #kfc
@kfcsa if that meat was meant for animal feed somewhere, then why is it so rigorously cleaned at #kfc branch!?!
@kfcsa MD must step down, to insult our intelligence, to be so cheaply dismissive, so undermining and condescending of the people! #kfc
@kfcsa MD is on sabc news saying, that was meat of poor quality.  It was cleaned and counted for animal feed. How insulting is this...
Sad thing about @kfcsa braamfontein is that junior staff and branch management will feel the wrath, not directors/big bosses.

@Innocensia that's so true. I'm just glad you know better.
@CurateZed @Innocensia could never turn me off otherwise I'd stare lower. It shouldn't matter, but it can be a shock the morning after.
@Innocensia mystics call this point-zero, where we know things we did not know we know.
@Innocensia we just have to know our selves. Our spiritual and natural design. Then we will know life's influence on us, vice versa.
@dmill187 @Innocensia welcome mate,
Shit man, only if coffee bars,where ideas are discussed, were as big as beer bars. How far would we be?
@Innocensia we don't, we can't, influence natural knowledge. We can only observe time and life, in passing. Yes?
@Innocensia excuse the semantics but how do we know we know? How do human beings know? Let's both find out.
Gosh! I just mentally masturbated and ejaculated. Overwhelmed. I need coffee. @Seattlecoffeeco @brooklynmall here I come, good friday
@Innocensia could be "their" reality but not truth. Reality is malleable at any moment. More, its an illusion. Esp the individual reality
Cool! "@Tee_Trixx: We should go out for a cup of coffee some time, we need to talk "
@Innocensia this is how monogamy was born, btw. Since women were vulnerable. Patriarchy dictated.
@Innocensia that. Such labels wouldn't exist. ALL LOVE.
I always thought this. For long. It hasn't changed. So?
As humans we are so petulant and naïve about what we perceive to be love. Our ego(self-image) fails us.
Love is supreme. Love IS!, essentially. Thus, it is illogical to say unconditional love. When we put adjectives to love. It isn't love.
Where we really know love. Heartbreaks are unnecessary, irrespective of whether your lover broke your heart or betrayed your trust.
But we are not capable of this, so let's not ;)
Yes. I would love "your" woman, you would "mine" . They would other men. And it would be ok. In a perfect world.
We would all love each other, without feeling the need to be each others possessions.
Lol, and to take it further. If we were really to love like God, Agape, then there wouldn't be my woman/man.
However, if both partners are spiritually enlightened and aware of Agape, then there won't be any hurting and need to forgive.
Agape, to love like God, gets over jealousy, heartbreak, hurt, disappointment and it is FOREVER FORGIVING.
In eros we refer to those we are in love with as MY MAN/WOMAN, its the love of ownership/selfishness/ego. Not agape, GREATER LOVE.
We are incapable of true, unconditional and greater LOVE, primarily because of our ego(self-image).
Now I wanna push the envelop. Human Beings are incapable of REAL LOVE(Agape). We are not fit for higher love.
If those conditions that hold the romantic love(eros) change then the love changes as well.
Romantic Love Can't be THE ULTIMATE LOVE, though it can be fulfilling. Eros is conditional.
Romantic Love(Eros) is limited. It thrives on senses, comfort, looks, security, pleasure etc; when these fall off , the affair is strained
I think the mistake we ALL make is confusing romance as the ULTIMATE LOVE. Which is false of course.
There will always be misunderstandings between men and women, even in normal relationships. Mind games vs heart matters.
We both heal. Win-Win. And this is just so we can have healthy relationships.
Which will in turn help heal the wounds inflicted by men on woman.
So inversely, women are actually the key to helping men heal.
But here a man is thinking 'physical' while she thinks its 'emotional. For a man can never win against women on emotions.
And we are aware of this. We reversed it. "If you love me, then prove it." We play your game.
So if I pick her up today, she goes telling her friends how much I love her. If I can't tomorrow, she says I don't love her anymore. Women.
Don't women always say if you LOVE me then you will do this and that for me? Imagine LOVE=Actions. Easy.
Men, victims, are aware of your insatiable need to feel being loved and they are taking advantage of it.
When you are aware of this sickness, you cant then turn around be on the men-bashing-spree. We need help, we need healing. Not attacking
Women, you have to be cognizant of all the factors that made men what they are today.
So the backlash is more against MEN than it is against women. So even now I won't tweet intensely as I was against men
Of course out of the dysfunction of the black family, women took more beating than men for obvious stated reason.
Its not science. see how world over, black mistreat their women.
Most of those years the black family was destroyed by slavery, colonialism world over. The end result is a psychologically broken black man.
For years society construed a man as someone who is not in touch with his emotions or express them. Rubbish of course.
The fact is that WE are both, Men and Women, victims of a deteriorated human value system. Men just took advantage of the more vulnerable.
I apologize for the hurt and irreparable damage MEN have caused WOMEN. Inexcusable.
Men, have taken advantage of this vulnerability of women.
Of course women are a weaker sex, physically. But a superior sex emotionally. And thus has put them on the bad receiving end against men.
So Women, lol..., first of all. I know this, we love y'all. You don't get to see, there's more behind this, but we really do.
So perhaps I should not place feminists, chauvinists, misandrists and misogynists in usual man and woman social relationships.
Some women,many, don't feel feminism represents them. Counter argument from feminists is that those are victims of patriarchal conditioning
I'm actually thinking of writing 'The Effects Of Feminism' on my blog,

And I'm not PATRONIZING WOMEN so as to get lucky, as tempting that as it is, we know it's the truth.
:)@Tee_Trixx: Wow this guy hey ♡_♡ @Galafani1 So gents! Write this on your foreheads, BOTH FOREHEADS! YOU ARE GODS!!! Carry yourself as such
@Innocensia I completely understand.
YOU ARE GODS for fuck's sake. Know this, feel this, believe this! Gods cannot be broken! U are driven, focused and determined.
So gents! Write this on your foreheads, BOTH FOREHEADS!, YOU ARE GODS!!! Carry yourself as such!
MEN created Feminist, Misandrists and Androphobes. Through our selfish actions. Pleasure seeking habits and destructive treatment of women.
...And WE, MEN, have given WOMEN every right and reason to give up on US! They haven't. They still demand the best out of us.
WOMEN never really gave up on MEN, never mind what they say; those are just emotional outbursts.
I have my view on FEMINISM but that's a talk for another day. Today, MEN NEED TO STEP UP!
WE CAN NEVER BE PERFECT, BUT WE CAN TRY TO BE BETTER...
MEN might have lost sight of their DIVINELY ORDAINED POWERS but WOMEN are still seeing it and are rightfully demanding it!
Yes! We have been broken, damaged, beaten up, took psychological battering BUT WOMEN still see the GREATNESS in MEN!
Women are asking us to step up.
I think women. All women, even feminists, misandrists and androphobes demand the best out of us, MEN!
@Tee_Trixx told you, in time.

WE LOVE WOMEN @Innocensia @josephmay23
Long before google. Research actually meant going to the library, pickup books, referenced, quote and sample. For Days!
@Innocensia yes. Maybe we should refrain from referring to those that bash women as men. Vice versa,
@josephmay23 @Innocensia yes. In my reality. ALL my male peers look after their women. Love their kids. Actually motivate their women.
@Innocensia guilt? I know its more complicated. Class, status and wealth acquisition/success should dictate an affair.
@Innocensia but I get what you mean. The listeners who were men, arguably, were against it. I just had to point out to be fair.
@Innocensia @josephmay23 honestly. Not just "Independent Women". Songs that showed appreciation for women and femininity are male produced.
Somebody created "a swimming pool floating beer cooler." When boredom breeds danger.
@Innocensia but ,alas, feminists say that's patronizing and condescending.
@Innocensia you'd be shocked to find who wrote, produced songs that emancipated women. Songs that worshiped the feminine spirit too,
@clairemawisa compare that to sox and ties for fathers day(if we are lucky to get anything)
@SmithInAfrica shit! I hope they are not comparing Van Riebeck to Mandela.
Oh well, there's @eNCAnews(DA mouthpiece) @josephmay23 @SABCNewsOnline @DA_News
Hahah, ayi SABC aint buying it. "@josephmay23: @Galafani1 @SABCNewsOnline @DA_News they're not showing it"
@josephmay23 @SABCNewsOnline @da_news aren't they showing it? I'm no DA but I'd like to see it. This is no campaigning. So?
@TMALIunisa little did we know he just presented a canonical speech. It took years, maybe 5, for people to appreciate " I am an African".
@TMALIunisa I remember this day. I watched it on tv with Ma. He went for like 15mins, Ma and I remarked how short it is. Little did we know.

@Africa_Rise @imanrappetti yes. I'm saying We aren't different. People on either side of the fence face same threats, fears, etc;
@nealcol @Kamogelo_17 @Kaizer_Chiefs good question, can only be answered by facts.
-R750K- pheeeew!!!
Mbeki spoke of 2economies long ago. Now we are realizing there's a market of people over qualified for RDP's but under qualified for Bonds.
...That's because in SA, its easy to buy a R75K car paid over 6yrs than to buy a R500K house paid over 20yrs. Who makes these rules?
Don't we always ridicule someone that drives a luxury car but resides in Alexander RDP House that has satellite Tv?
@Africa_Rise @imanrappetti and that's all illusion, we have same fears, hopes, financial challenges(varying degrees), in one reality.
South African English, I like the sound of that.
@Jamaineathena that also, which english is SA following? Is it both? Or is it South African English?

...And its ok. We can't all be conscious, activist, deep, political. We must have athletes, socialites, entrepreneurs, artists, dancers etc

And that's the thing about freedom, choice. Our fore-bearers didn't die so we can struggle. They left us a legacy of the will to choose.
Keep it up so called born frees.

SA INTELLECTUAL PUBLIC DISCOURSE IS A FIESTA OF IDEOLOGIES. A FESTIVAL OF IDEAS, THEORIES AND MODELS.
how do SA rappers lack content and substance when theres so much to talk about? i mean SA is live with debates, issues, life maters.

i dont beat about the bush, i go straight to the point. gala's spot. G'spot.

@MandlaMkhize ya, hence prior tweet explaining about pele and maradona. those were 2 uncontested for long but now theres messi in equation
all hail #messi. done
i am just lucky to be witnessing the greatest footballer of our time doing his thing.
i never saw pele play. but stats volume. maradona as well.
...we had to watch it in slow motion to fully appreciate it. it only looks easy in slow motion. thats how ahead #messi is.
...then messi chipped it with his weaker foot STRAIGHT over neur. it looks easy. its not. this is all in split secs. that fast.
1st goal made nuer look average. 2nd goal, not to humiliate boateng, but he seemed to pulled by some magical magnetic force to the ground
dictionaries have to be pulled out at post-match pressers because of adjectives drawn from galaxies gone by used to describe #MESSI
MESSI.
now that we got that out of the way.

first. 3 of my daily tweets(affirmations really).
Night escapades
And that was my festival of football!!!
No way Bayern is going to put more than 3 goals in 2nd leg without Barca responding. Bayern are out!!!
If Bayern doesn't pull an away goal they'll have it all to do for 2nd leg.
Messi is out of this world!!!
Messi pulls a goal out of nowhere! When Nuer was good all evening,
Brilliance!!! Messi!!!
@Tee_Trixx oh, my bad. Good night :)
I love @Kaizer_Chiefs more than Barcelona. I will finish this match then switch. :)
Awuwa! Our defense today

@Kaizer_Chiefs is going to pull a beautiful goal. Watch,

No! Mr Ref!!! Yesses! They equally challenged for ball! why fault Shabba? @OfficialPSL have been pathetically inferior this season!
@KskHanz not ya Tefo le Matoho? They were caught flat footed.
@YesWeCrann you folks should consider publishing on thursdays when when weekend and midweek games are done. Now you seem outdated,

Know yourself,
Even though I'm full of ideas and visions, I could never lead. I know myself. Leadership is stern, austere
That's why I could never lead. I turned those down in organizations I've been with.
I love to play, I exult in excitement, inspiration and intelligence. I indulge in all that feeds the mind, body and soul.
#ItsAllWithin,
@Tee_Trixx I figured myself out.
This is where I wanna be..., no. This where I am,
So in view left brain is dry, dull, dispassionate. While the Right brain is exciting, mysterious, passionate.
Left brain: analytical, logical, strategic, egoistic, rational
Right Brain: instinct, intuition, passion, creativity, altruistic,
I'm a man, needless to say. But I am more excited by the Right Brain Than the left Brain.
Women are more on the Right Brain. Men are more on the left brain. Generally. That is not to say Men don't feel or women don't think.
Vintage Battle between the mind and the heart.
Rational Vs Emotional.

We just have to be in tune with ourselves then everything will effortlessly come to us.

As within, so without. The morning hecticness, rush, chaos, clumsiness, disorder, forgetfulness, etc; mirrors your inner turmoil.
As you think, so you are. Your character is a sum total of your thoughts.
Watch your Words, Actions, Thoughts, Character, Habit. W.A.T.C.H
Choose to be positive. Choose to be happy. Regardless of you material condition. Happy, optimistic and lively people are successful.
You don't realize how powerful you are until you see your minor negative attitude/choice have a huge impact/consequence on your life.
Breath right!
Take time out, Mind your thoughts, Breaths and heartbeat.
Take time out to go to your inner most spaces. You'd be astonished what you'd discover.
Whether you are troubled or not, lead a hectic or a easy life. You have to take time off. Be still in silence, doing nothing.
You have to allocate time and space for yourself, everyday. To pay attention to your innerself, to rid toxic thoughts/emotions
We give it a trendy and fancy name like meditation but this practice is natural. Its done by all humanity not just easterners.

I'm not patronizing women. I'm not being pro-feminism. Check facts.
I've lost hope in male leadership. Women must take charge. Maybe they can do better. They lead humanity from birth, where does it change?
The time for strong African women to lead has been long overdue. African men can't lead anymore. They think with their bellies and balls.
@thobeka_xaba oh why, thank you Thobeka... :)
Do you think if any of these women were of any other race from any where in the world, they wouldve been kept for a week?
Really? Let's allow the USA to freely and openly run Africa! We are useless! African leaders are useless! No backbones!
I mean what's new? An african life has no value right? We die every time of everything everywhere right?
I am just another dead black man.
We know what? Blacks must just admit that the afro-pessimism has also desensitized them as well. Our own misery doesn't shake us anymore.
We don't care.
And why is international media leading with these story and nothing from local media?
if this story of 200 pregnant women doesn't irk african leaders then africa is not fit to lead itself.

Olive oil is actually vegetable seed oils, artificial ingredients and olives in small percentages! oh well,

"@RT_com: Unwanted for 50 years: Swiss banks track 1000s of unclaimed accounts 
We must interrogate #BlackTax vs #unearnedwealth  further until we can get to its crux.
I'm actually ambivalent about buying property in gauteng. Being the 1st generation to own. Must invest for future generations. #BlackTax
You might have savings, investments etc; but if something happens to you. Your family won't be able to sustain that 50k lifestyle #BlackTax
We can't AFFORD to buy property in gauteng, for e.g; even if you earn R50K a month. Being the 1st to own. #BlackTax
And blacks are currently in a precarious situation with their wealth, lack thereof. We are the 1st generation, generally, to own. #BlackTax
Apartheid regressed us. We can't compete, in any sphere, on equal footing with those previously advantaged. #BlackTax vs #UnearnedWealth
We are at least 3, at most 7, generations behind our white counterparts on wealth accumulation. #BlackTax Vs #UnearnedWealth
Some people start from zero to build themselves up, others on a positive. We start on a negative! #BlackTax
Maybe "reverse social engineering" is needed. Every law passed to regress blacks, its opposite must be drafted to advance blacks #BlackTax
#BlackTax We went only halted by #Apartheid. It also regressed us. So we can't compete on equal footing with those favored by apartheid.
So now you have #BlackTax vs #unearnedwealth or #undeservedwealth of #whiteprivileges @imanrappetti @Powerfm987
3. Whites were a minority to have built this infrastructure with their own money. Hence #BlackTax. @imanrappetti @Powerfm987
2. When the new @GovernmentZA came into power they had to pay the #ApartheidDebt, with tax payers money #BlackTax @imanrappetti @Powerfm987
Before '94 a lot of blacks paid taxes for services they never received. #BlackTax @imanrappetti @Powerfm987 @GovernmentZA
I'm of the view that @GovernmentZA owes, literally, blacks. #BlackTax @imanrappetti @Powerfm987
There's more causes of #BlackTax than the financial meltdown, financial illiteracy and poverty. @imanrappetti @Powerfm987

@Innocensia if it works then great, never mind the what, how and why
@Innocensia @MzLee_ how I came up with "its all within", "it all doesn't matter", "we need healing",
@Innocensia see? We are twisted scientists. Experimenting on self. Hedonism works I guess, pleasure over pain.
Good to see you @_MatStar
@Innocensia @MzLee_ reason I come up with positive pieces is that I write under all inspiration, not only in pain but in joy as well.
@Innocensia @MzLee_ I guess this is where we all meet, writing. Also recommended by pro's.
@Innocensia @MzLee_ I'd also like to know, my ways don't always work. So suggestions welcomed
@Innocensia close calls. It affects most who spend time in their heads. Painful event not a necessary cause.
@Innocensia I know. Ideally we should be pro-active on this. We are not. So at the first symptoms, we should seek help. Support

I doubt u will succeed. Even If they are willing, most broken men need healing, but hey...human spirit is resilient "@Innocensia: innate"
Human natural/spiritual design is complex. It can't be left unattended, lest we let loose the beast within
we need to be aware of the natural 7year character progression and guide through each life stage, from day one!(7,14,21yrs)
...by the time they try to sit u down and guide your virtues, qualities and character, it is mostly too late.

Anything less that your greatness betrays your godly spirit. And I'm not talking ONLY material abundance.
Positive growth is life's natural progression. All that abundant life force within you is meant for flourishing.
Growth, like reality, varies in degrees. Some grow deeper in struggle, ignorance and hardships; others grow deeper in wealth and abundance.
Change is good but that isn't necessary reason to want it. Goodness also changes, rather you grow accustomed to it. So seek infinite growth.
Blame game weakens you. Easy way out is for the weak. Assume responsibility and realise emancipation.

I just wanna be excited, be inspired, be amused, be awed, be tickled, playful, creative, be shown new things,
When there was no social sites, circa 2006, I read and wrote a lot if I couldn't sleep. Guess I'm tired of it all
@JusMissK joke
I'm pressed. But I'm already comfy in bed. Can't start all over. Will hold it , until I dream of going or coming;)

Mmmhhh not looking forward to your age! ;) "@JusMissK: @Galafani1 I used to be like that too but age caught up with me <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>"

@ThandiNtuli I'm still :(
Beyonce is a successful wife and mother, if that isn't exemplary IDK what is. I don't care if she twerks her labia majora!
@Notemash7 in a natural, almost spiritual, level. Pussy power is humanities sanctuary :) secures humanities seed with its attraction force.
@Notemash7 society prejudices, wrongly, women as selling their bodies. Show me one person, man/woman, that's attracted to a hobo.
@Notemash7 well, on a social level we use class, status and materialism to get pussy. Women view those aspects as security and stability.
All politics aside, Beyonce worked hard on this project. The quality says it all. As 'PAC said "put money behind the dreams".
Alone with my daughter. Preparing food while she is watching Beyonce videos on Channel-O. Should I be worried with all twerking going on?
You are Nkosikazi notwithstanding that you aren't of royalty.
You need to do research in African cosmogeny and find out why women, in nguni spirituality for instance, are called "Nkosikazi".
@setsa_bee cool,
Way too early to even consider mathematical permutations. Though next 28points will secure. "@Tumzaza3: Its still early #14GamesLeft"
-been-
The Pussy Power Myth is Real. It has just be applied wrong or rather ignorantly.
Is it too early a Sunday morning to say the "P" word? Mind u not all of us feel we just remembered God exist, this morning. So..., be strong
In science necessity is the mother of invention. In nature, women are mothers of civilizations; literally.
You need to understand certain perceptions towards women. Only greatness is expected of Goddesses.
I don't think women understand their power in the greater natural scheme of things*patronising*. Even when submissive they retain authority.
Hahah! "@drtlaleng: Better start massaging and tugging at these nipples coz no ways I'm getting a pump. Iyadura yoh"

Hope she becomes a practitioner so she can get to do with her peers around home :), our mothers need this. @UrbanBikramYoga
Just found out My Ma(56yrs) is doing yoga around PTA north. I'm so happy for happy! :), she looks great, calm and healthy @UrbanBikramYoga
In my rest mode ...
@thobeka_xaba lol, just for record. Long before this revelation, I always loved basotho women. They are so effortlessly...charming :)
*hides* lol. I've been hearing this a lot, so it must be true! Apparently Basotho women know how to treat a man "@Jamaineathena:  0_o"
Sigh. SAs only confed.cuf "@Tumzaza3: @galafani1 @kaizer_chiefs @nealcol Maybe because its 2nd rate to the CAF CL."
Yup "@Tumzaza3: @galafani1 Yeah that the target. 70+ Points. We gonna have to drop only 11 Points though."
Apparently SA men prefer Maids from Lesotho. "Ntate Masilela, le ka thabela coffee kapa Kuku?"
Why is @Kaizer_Chiefs 'only continental cup, cup winners cup; now caf confederation's cup, played dowm? WE WON IT! @nealcol @Tumzaza3

SEE?!? "@jeffersohn: @Galafani1 It gets ridiculous when you think that Swallows have won the ABSA Cup. But they've never won the ABSA Prem."
Lol, I'm looking forward to Pitso!
@jeffersohn yes. Totally agree.
@jeffersohn I always wished they'd give cups their official names.

@jeffersohn good word play.
Huh? "@philitjie: We are going to win this game #OrlandoPiratesRekaofela"
@Tehranical right.
@Tehranical Your condescending tone. I did not ask YOU anything. My question is directed at SA media's reticence on exposing US torture.
@Tehranical yeah? Shit loads? This space is out of your reasoning league
@mailandguardian any reports on torture by the USA? #internationalhumanrightsday
I smell like a real man. I'll leave that open to interpretation.
I see, "@Notemash7:  it was just her saying "on sentencing I applied the law correctly""
Why is SA Media mum on USA @CIA human rights abuses? On #InternationalHumanRightsDay ! @verashni @ferialhaffajee @maxdupreez
@Notemash7 then shouldn't she have not ruled on the sentencing? Set it aside until the conviction by appeals court is finished?

@josephmay23 its painful though,
Well, if NPA wins at appeals court then the sentence is impacted on?
Isn't this backward? Appeal for culpable homicide conviction granted but Appeal for sentencing denied?
$4.1Million! Papa! "@josephmay23: @PzFeed @Galafani1 how much is the lawsuit?"

It is! "@Notemash7: Is that not a woman thing? RT @Galafani1: I haven't heard a man say he expects his woman to make him happy. You?"
Ladies, they wouldn't hurt you or make you sad if you didn't rely on them for happiness.
I haven't heard a man say he expects his woman to make him happy. You?
I don't get it "@IsimaOdeh: La Liga is a joke."

Great progress. I wonder what's the delay. They must do the right thing @PlaySAMusic check 
When it comes to vanity rappers are ultimate divas! Such prima donna tendencies
I hope these artists don't confuse they fame hype with success. Many have been much higher but...
SA rappers have jelly backs. They won't go against the system to have their songs played. Mzakhe, spokes H suffered. @PlaySAMusic
How's the partition coming ? @PlaySAMusic
I don't blame artists like @erniesmithzn @jbutlerguitar that go stay abroad. @ArtsCultureSA @PlaySAMusic @sabcnewsonline PLAY SA MUSIC!
Why is it so difficult to get #sabc to play more local music? This is a shame on sabc and @GovernmentZA @ArtsCultureSA @PlaySAMusic
@MsCassandraGud very true, we need  @ArtsCultureSA @sabcnewsonline #icasa make local content priority over foreign @PlaySAMusic
Arts And Literature. &lt;3
@MsCassandraGud true. Generally. Quality was compromised, especially the sound in music. The talent has always been there.
Miriam Makeba, lucky dube, Gerard Sekoto, Lefifi Tladi,  etc, WE NEED DOMINANT EXPOSURE. @MsCassandraGud @PlaySAMusic
Not to differ with you. Our arts have been great since inception. Ipi'ntombi, king Kong, sarafina, shaka zulu  @MsCassandraGud @PlaySAMusic

@Notemash7 my man!
Lol, next time you ignorantly say 'sex is magical', think about those words.
Word, sound and creative power.
Saying the right things at the right time. Prayer has been a powerful tool long before the advent of religion.
Spiritual quotient "@Notemash7: What is SQ? RT @galaword: SQ=EQxIQ. EQ=SQ/IQ. According to me"
Some say the easy way out is through deliverance.
...all the soul ties, spiritual union, sacred magic they did on our forebearers. How it affects you now. No time/space in spirit world.

Not modern politics though. there's a variety of politics "@josephmay23 politics really is just human nature. So its always been there"
I know they haven't made a smash car like Audi, BMW and Benz did but Jaguar remains my favourite.
@josephmay23 this question indoctrination.
@Notemash7 no man
@josephmay23 I remember. But this is beyond politics. This is as it could be/should be. But then there was politics
Like if I go now. It would be like I prepared. I leave things in order :). Maggie calls me a freak of nature

Sundays are my 'me-time', sometimes mom, but mostly me.
Munna dumela @Notemash7
@josephmay23 I know. Competency is not really the issue. Energy sector has been a target of foreign corporates/states. Sasol is next
@josephmay23 SA is up for grabs. Private sector is running us anyway. We are lagging with research/development. They'll just swallow us.

Funny how when its the weekend thinkers moan that there's is no space for them to excite themselves. I will make one, with a higher purpose
That's what I'm gonna do. I know all needed people. They'll be excited at this.
Maybe I should back off and make #IntelligentsiaCouncil an elite secret society ;), lol. I CAN! I've acquired all the necessary skills.
Politics ultimately  fit someone's political agenda. #IntelligentsiaCouncil
Politics are exhausted so much we are suffering political fatigue. #IntelligentsiaCouncil would ideally, if possible, avoid politics.
He's within you ;)  "@Sir_Tyee: I can't find the word father in the dictionary"
That is partly because the white man is still "boss", in power.
Lol, I wonder why, and I apologise if its racist, that if I were to appoint a council of intelligentsia I'd struggle to find a white male.
The intelligentsia, creatives and critical thinkers have a duty to shape and entice the psyche of a society as new as ours. - @eusebius
-overall literature AND academics appreciation-
We are a new nation. We should be coming up with our own philosophies, ideas and overall literature academics appreciation. @eusebius
Our universities should be hosting Olympics of ideas and festivals of theories, on broad topical issues not just politics. @eusebius
Our CRITICAL THINKERS are CONFINED INTO a political/current affairs space. REDUCED to POLITICAL ANALYSTS and OPINION EXPERTS :) - @eusebius
It must be frustrating to be a critical thinker in modern times, especially within South Africa space/context. - @eusebius
LOVE YOU MORE! "@loveblvck: My brothas/sistas, Have you been told you're loved today? If not, I love you! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>"
WE ARE IN SUCH A SLEEPY STATE, IT FRUSTRATES TO BE AWAKE! IGNORANCE IS BLISS. "Everything has its time and space" - @josephmay23
So with the current sleepy state we are in, lies an opportunity of the great awakening.
A state of lacking, like struggle and poverty, is 100% pure potentiality to discover.
Enlightenment is needed more today than ever before. Given the current state of humanity. Moral degeneration, substance abuse, ignorance etc
Modern education makes u a professional that is hired and fired, economic commodity, at someone's will. It puts you to sleep with comfort.
Enlightenment is the pursuit of self-discovery, self-knowledge and self-development. Eventually arriving at fulfilment.
