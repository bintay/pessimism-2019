@DieKarbitans Alaba would've scored that freekick!!! also i haven't but that doesnt make me less cultured u see (i fucking love museums btw)
@DieKarbitans anyways just imagined if Alaba-Robbery played and Javi instead of Alonso. goddamn we would've been more in control of the game
@DieKarbitans I am indeed lmao but I still remember the monumen kapal selam drag<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> after that i went to a mall
Let's just move on shall we
@DieKarbitans BRUH THEY ARE OUR WALL so many fabulous saves they did!! footballers are also humans let's all move on
@DieKarbitans -after that our squad were mentally wrecked.it's a very different Barça squad from 2013 but we hv too many injured key players
@DieKarbitans @Manuel_Neuer Our defense were solid in 1st half, got better in the first mins of 2nd half, &amp; I think after the 1st Messi goal
