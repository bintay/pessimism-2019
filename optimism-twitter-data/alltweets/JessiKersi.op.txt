I hate that feeling when you want something so bad that you're terrified you won't get it.
I swear that I'm yours, but you'll never be mine.
Since moving to Nashville, I have felt wanted and loved. I have never been this optimistic about my future. #NashLife
I guess it's just as well, but I miss your face like hell.
The people in this city are so amazing! I can't decide who I want to work for more. #NashLife #SoManyOptions
2 back-to-back interviews today! Got my fiercest dress and smile on. Here goes nothin'! #NashLife
Some chapters end way too soon and some characters leave too quickly.
I just want to have an exciting story to tell.
Fighting between what I actually want and what I think I should want.
Adulting when all you want to do is cuddle and cry is unbelievably difficult and frustrating.
Having one of those days where the only logical option is to go to bed early.
You can't make people choose to fulfill the potential you see in them.
Watching About Time makes me wonder if relationships really can be simple and lovely.

Me: Can we take a nap?
Knowing what you hoped for will never happen leaves an emptiness you didn't realize was possible.
When things end, it hurts. It doesn't matter if the ending is happy or sad, or even if the decision is healthy. Endings always hurt.
The double standards of this world are ridiculous. Be who you want to be. Others have no right to judge.
I'm tired of caring about the mistakes other people make. It just leads to unwanted stress and heartbreak.
@schneidmaster Thank you! I might need to find one soon. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I need a distraction and a drink.
I need to find a way to let go of this selfishness.
And I've never felt so lonely. This void is like a canyon in my soul.
Taking the backroads trying to forget how much I miss my comfort zone.
When I say let's keep in touch, I hope you know I mean I wish that you'd grow up.
<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> If it makes you less sad, I'll move out of the state
You can keep to yourself, I'll keep out of… 
Only @brandnewrock will do on nights like these.
<WHITE SMILING FACE>️ 
I'll wait for you, but I'll be happy when you're gone.
Forgot to pack one of the most important things. #WayToGo #Fuuuckkk
Being this level of done is oddly freeing.
Trying to fight the urge to get on I-65 and drive home in time for church. #MissMyBoys
June 11th needs to be here so I can finally see @XAmbassadors in concert!!!
Need to replenish my good vibes soon. #Drained
There are certain perks to being an adult that can't be enjoyed when one is subjected to juvenile rules.
There are certain rules that are not worth following.
Going on a vice cleanse.
Intense dreams put me in a weird head space. #Stahp
Irrational emotions terrify me.
Unloading all my crap on complete strangers seems to be something I excel at. #SoSorry #PleaseDontJudge
I've spent the last 10 years feeling nothing at all. So I'm willing to feel an immense amount of pain just to feel a little bit of love.
Realizations come when you let all your cares melt away.
I'm just gone to the point where I realize I'm sick of wasting my time.
Loyalty is overrated. Have fun with whoever you can while you're young and free.
I am very quickly falling in love with this city. #NashLife 
Sometimes you find the most beautiful places when you take a wrong turn.
It's a good thing I'm the type of person who enjoys getting lost cause I can't seem to go anywhere in this city without doing so. #NashLife
Every time I see that skyline, I can't contain my smile. #NashLife
Everything’s changed, everything’s changed. The same old lovers with the same old games.
Been talkin' bout the way things change and my family lives in a different state. If you don't know what to make of this we will not relate.
Its ridiculous because the Ferguson prosecutor had an overwhelming conflict of interest but since it helped the officer he wasn't dismissed.
Seriously?!? Basically they know she can win the case, so they are making up a 'conflict of interest'. #Baltimore  
Snarky is American for smart ass bitch. #SoTrue #SoFunny #ILoveShelley @NBCUndateable
I'm pretty sure every time @chrisdelia said 'panda' in the @NBCUndateable live episode, a button of his shirt popped off.
Finally catching up on @NBCUndateable! 5 min in and I'm already laughing so hard I'm crying. #FavoriteShow
It is amazing how much can change in just 3 weeks.
Speak using patterns amplified by sound.
Roll over and touch me angel. Nothing ever happens on dusty beds.
Fucking catch me leaving cause life's that way.
Just interviewed for my current dream job with an amazing company. #HopeIGetIt #NashLife
This is bullshit. Thinking your life is more valuable than another is why the world is so broken.  
I wish I could listen to @FFEENNCCEESS every second of every day. These songs make me experience life on another level. #SimplyBeautiful
You know I loved you till it hurt.
Is a cuddle buddy really too much to ask for? #Annoyed #NeedHumanContact
And if you truly knew, you wouldn't talk to me like you do.
Got to break out of this anti-social mood.
For you I would do anything. #SongsAboutAngels
All I want to do today is lounge around and listen to someone play guitar.
I am so bad at making food for one person. I need to find someone else to cook for or Imma get fat real quick.
2 more job interviews scheduled today! #SoExcited #GonnaBeBusy #NashLife
I always forget just how difficult it is to be away from the ones you love most. It's like your heart has to find a new tune. #HomeSick
Missing my baby boy and favorite cuddle buddy today. #SeparationAnxiety #MyMonster 
Trying really hard to muster up the energy and desire to get out of bed today. #MissingPeople #SoTired
@blueoctober always reminds me of how far I've come. The stories remind me of the pain I once felt.
My biggest fear is to become the person I used to be.
I can't be broken again. I won't survive it.
I just hope the person I've become is here to stay.
Days where you leave the house at 9AM and you don't get home till almost midnight are my favorite. #NashLife
So thankful for amazing women who love sharing their stories and listening to a complete stranger's story. #NashLife
I've probably become that weird chick that gets too comfortable too quick with new people. #SorryNotSorry #NashLife
Meeting new people used to scare me. Now it makes me super excited and happy.
Eventually I will be able to drive in Nashville without getting lost. #DontEvenKnow #NashLife
Now that I live somewhere with non-sketchy clubs, I need to find friends to dance with me. #GingerJiggle #NashLife
Wake up! You need to make money.
Pretty sure I'm going to hell for finding this as hilarious as I do. #SorryNotSorry #TeachSafeSex  
Trying to resist the urge to run back home where it's safe and comfortable. #StruggleBus #MissMyBoys
Job interview today. Got job. Start working Saturday. At least 1 job interview next week. #NashLife #GetShitDone
Sometime life doesn't go the way you plan. In fact, sometime it leads you down paths that are better than you could've ever imagined.
Saying goodbye is hard to do. I can't believe I no longer get to see my goofy crew on a weekly basis. Missing them like crazy today.
Kiss me just to shut me up.
Just put Mosaic Church as a former employer. #IMightCry #MissThemLikeCrazy
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, but I'm doing something and that's what matters.
I get things done! #GotAJob #NashLife
Maybe if I'm super productive tomorrow I'll reward myself with a little @NBCUndateable. #Incentives #FavoriteShow #BestComedians
Got my first lead on a potential job. #NashLife #SoFreakingExcited #NewBeginnings
Life is all about the stories. I want my life to be focused on ensuring everyone has the very best. #EventPlannerGoals
I touched the sky as my knees hit the ground.
I am where I'm supposed to be. This place will soon feel like home. #NashLife #SoExcited
Set my goal. Now it's time to work my ass off to accomplish it. #NashLife
Celebrating this beautiful Cinco de Mayo with a yummy veggie burrito from @ChipotleTweets!
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind. Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight.
Checking out the local eats. First stop tacos and margaritas at @thelocaltaco in Brentwood. #NashLife
Extreme boredom leads to an overwhelming desire for tacos and margaritas. #NashLife
Worst part of moving is having no friends to grab a drink with.
Need to find a job today, but all I really want to do is take a nap. #AdultProblems
Day 1 of my new life. I am so ready to make the most of it! #Excited #NewHome
Currently infatuated with @halseymusic's song #Ghost. The lyrics are beautifully crafted and her voice is simply angelic. #GoldenBabe
I wish you would finally see that I'm that a person I used to be.
My happy place is sitting around listening to someone play guitar.
I like the sad eyes, bad guys, mouth full of white lies. Kiss me in the corridor, but quick to tell me goodbye.
You say that you're no good for me cause I'm always tugging at your sleeve. And I swear I hate you when you leave, but I like it anyway.
Going to a new church and hearing exactly what you needed is both rough and amazing.
The first step in evangelism is listening.
That awkward moment when you're so used to living on the coast that you assume every highway leads north.
Going to any church that's not Mosaic will always feel a bit odd to me. They're more than just a church, they've become my family.
Laughter is the best medicine. And stand up comics are the greatest healers.
I can't wait to meet new people and find new places. #MovingTime #BuildingANewHome
Found a new haven today in Cummins Falls. I can't wait to explore all the beautiful places in TN. #AdventurousSpirit 
Take it all, take it away
We'll still have our riches,
No need for stitches
'Cause love mends the pain
All I want to do is free fall.
He doesn't sleep, so in truth he never wakes up.
I'll find a traveling companion one day, but for now I'll enjoy being alone with music and the sounds of nature.
All I need to be happy are the outdoors and an open road.
I'm in love with love.
The city makes a perfect place to sleep.
She'll be a secret you can keep. Keep me.
The weather today is as beautiful as you were.
When I look at the beauty of the state you called home, I get incredibly excited for you and the beauty you're enjoying now.
I will choose to be happy because I know that's all you wanted for me.
He speaks to me through music better than a preacher ever could.
So I will run until my feet don't touch the ground. And as the waves carry me out, keep listening she'll never make a sound.
When I die, drink a glass of scotch and smoke a cigar and through my ashes into the sea.
I hate funerals. They don't honor the person. They don't help with grief. They're just stupid ceremonies culture dictates we have.
Scenic roads are nice, until you're late to something important, like a funeral. #GoFaster
Whenever I'm in Tennessee, I wonder why I didn't move here sooner.
Just saw a group of hippies sitting in the median, next to their wrecked car, playing guitar. #NeedToBeBestFriends #AllTheGoodVibes
Every time I get in my car I have to tell myself not to drive to California.
Sometimes you just have to eat a burrito at 10AM. #SoHungry #TwoMoreHours
I have not been this exhausted in a long time. #NeedSleep #NashvilleBound
And I'll just be the girl with several places to call home.
Leaving home never gets easier.
Today I celebrate the love between two awesome people. Tomorrow I celebrate the life of an amazing woman.
I am just a villain vying for attention from a girl. A girl who can't decide and here's the reason why. Girls love girls and boys.
If you change your mind, you know where to find me 'cause I don't care about your reputation.
And it'll never be me, but I'm learning to be okay with that.
And it's time for me to move along.
Sleep eludes me constantly. Thoughts always win this nightly battle. And now grief has set his eyes on the prize.
Every life has infinite value. Every person deserves to be loved.
I'm going to try to not disappear this time. Instead, I'm going to allow myself to grow and get my life together.
There are so many 'girl' things I suck at, but I'm pretty sure painting my nails is at the top of the list.
I've thought this several times in the last week. 
With everything that's happened this week, I keep forgetting it's only Wednesday.
Still not a good enough reason to use the word penetrate. #TheThreePs
My favorite line of any movie ever will always be, "This ginger needs her jiggle juice." #StoryOfMyLife #QuoteItDaily
Ice cream, Pitch Perfect, and cuddling make a perfect night of bonding with the little sis.
I'm sorry choosing to be happy in the midst of grief is such an inconvenience.
Grief destroys any resemblance of sanity you once held dear.
I have got to figure out something to do tomorrow. If my mind is left to wander, I'm going to go fucking insane.
Sometimes all it takes is a long drive and some good food to make things start to feel slightly okay again.
From this moment on, I'm going to live an adventurous life. I'm tired of missed opportunities and being content with boredom.
Secret love, are you there? Will you answer my prayer? Please take me anywhere but here.
I hate condolences. All I want is for someone to say 'Wow, that fucking sucks. Want to do some shots?' Is that really too much to ask?
@Zac_Holliday She seems like she would. Her voice is killer.
I need to get lost, on the woods or on the road. I just need to go and not care where I end up.
Just found out my aunt passed away early this morning. Please keep my family in your prayers, we desperately need them.
I never want the good vibes flowing from @kehlanimusic's new album to end. #NewFave #GorgeousVoice #BeautifulWords
Please just do whatever it is that makes you happy. That's all I ask of you.
Please remember that there are no valid excuses to not show love. 
I love having civil discussions about religion and politics with people who disagree with you. It makes you realize why you believe things.
Even if it kills me, I'm going to live my life pouring out love, kindness, and compassion to everyone I meet.
When I look at all the hatred in the world, I realize my purpose in this world is to love every individual unconditionally.
And this is just the beginning. The hatred and stereotypes aimed at the people in these neighborhoods is alarming.  
#Valid 
There's nothing I wouldn't do just to get up next to you.
Comparison kills.
Hanging out with musicians has made me the kind of person who sings in public. #NotComplaining
The world needs ethical journalists that care more about the helping the citizens of the world than making a profit.
Until the mentality of one life being worth more than another ends, we will continue to have situations like #Baltimore.
I need to start dancing every second of every day, so I can shut my brain off to everything but the music and the movement.
Some times you got to bleed to know that you're alive and have a soul, but it takes someone to come around to show you how.
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the later. @twentyonepilots #StressedOut #BlurryFace #Amen #PreachIt
I found my soul and it's more beautiful than I could've imagined.
This is why @twentyonepilots will always be my favorite band. They create beautiful songs that capture my soul. 
I need to find the courage to start writing again.
Only love can heal. Anger, resentment, and aggression solve nothing.
Instead of assuming the worst in citizens, how about we make sure government entities are actually doing  their best to SERVE &amp; protect.
Life. 
I want to awaken the passion within every soul.
I just want someone to grab my hand and ask me to dance.
What I would give to get out of my head for a day.
This weather messes with my soul.
I did the one thing I promised I wouldn't do.
How am I supposed to tell the difference between what I want and what I'm meant to do.
I would come every time you call.
You've been flying so high, avoiding the ground, pretending to not feel alone.
I want to see if I'm capable of having and being had.
Having amazing friends with great love stories gives me hope.
I just want to love w/o holding back. There are too many sad &amp; lonely people on this planet. I want to make at least one happy.
One day.  
Nothin' is as it has been
And I miss your face like hell
And I guess it's just as well
But I miss your face like hell
Passionate people give me butterflies.
Love and good vibes are flowing out of me tonight. I hope they stick around for a while.
@IronAndWine sings an acoustic version of Such Great Heights. #ImInLove #ThanksBeautifulPeople
Need to remind myself of this constantly. 
I broke down my walls and I refuse to ever put them back up.
I don't have a choice, but I still choose you.
Sometimes I forget how much I love folk music. Great story telling and a beautiful guitar are all you need to make me fall in love.
We've been lonely too long.
Life is so much easier when you only stress about your own life. Judging others just adds negativity you do not need.
Definitely gonna spend most of the day Friday dancing in my room to figure out which dress to wear to a wedding. #GottaBePerfect
Sometimes I say things I think will be funny and cute, but they just end up sounding stupid and lame.
I just want to dance the night away. #Friday
@Zac_Holliday I would never! Some silly country boy would though.
Very thankful for friends who won't let you say good bye.
@Zac_Holliday is the coolest person on planet earth. #redic
Pretty sure I'm going to break my rule and return to Ohio for Bunbury this year. #GoodMusic #GoodFun #CinCity
I need the smell of summer. I need its noises in my ear.
Hey Sweetie, I need you here tonight.
That soul-crushing fear cuts away all the happiness and love and leaves behind only anger and resentment.

Brush the dirt up off my psyche.
Stand up. Dust yourself off. Be better tomorrow.
Since when do I need validation. This is not who I've become.
Caught in the ropes of who I used to be. Realizing that old habits come back far too quick.
I just can't hold it in anymore. I feel the decay beginning again.
Drop everything. Start it over. Remember more than you'd like to forget.
Misinterpretation leads to frustration.
I'm in love with all the stories I've yet to hear. Never be afraid of telling your story.
I told myself I wouldn't be mad about McDreamy's death, but really?!? He died because he went to the wrong damn hospital?!? @GreysABC
Finally knowing what I want in life just makes things more complicated.
One of these days I'll either be rich enough to go to all the concerts and festivals or I'll have a job where I can work them.
Pizza + Moscato + @GreysABC = a wonderful, stress-free night. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Tell me a story that will make me fall in love.
Tonight's insomnia has lead to finding almost every event planning company in Nashville. #HopeTheyreHiring #FutureEventPlanner
All I really want to do with my life is encourage passionate people. I want everyone to know they can be happy and that they are loved.
Never expected that listening to country music would give me such comfort.
I just want to know what my life is going to look like in 5 years. I need hope that all this pain and heartbreak is worth it.
Going on Twitter on a #TGIT was a stupid mistake on my part. Can't wait to watch the latest @GreysABC episode tomorrow! #Spoiled
So thankful for people who understand my minor freak outs. #GoingHome #CantWait
@RedeemedRob Just returning the favor. You've always been an inspiration to me. <FISTED HAND SIGN>🏻
I just want someone who will cuddle and make me laugh, but for now I'll settle for #TheBigBangTheory and cocktails.
I have no idea how to make any decision concerning my future. #MilitaryKidProblems
While sitting in a coffee shop in Nashville, I overheard someone say they love @RedeemedRob. Needless to say, I fangirled. #MissThatGuy
I'm starting to understand why housewives have affairs. This domestic shit is stressful.
You're only replaceable if you want to be.
When lonely days turn into lonely nights, I turn to comedy and cognac for company.
Death has many faces. It lies to you and taunts you. It makes you brave and it makes you weak. In the end it always takes your breath away.
Reason #3567 why I'd be a terrible wife: Being domestic makes me want to murder people and down a bottle of scotch.
Why do food manufacturers put expiration dates in the most illegible places? #DomesticStruggles
I'm beginning to understand why so many country songs talk about driving down back roads.
The worst lies are the ones we tell ourselves.
I just need someone to talk to, but I can't put that on you.
I just want to go home. <PENSIVE FACE>
Back to playing nanny for a bit. Hopefully I'll get a job soon.
Even when I feel like the world is crashing down, I'm still amazed at how much I've grown and the confidence I've gained.
My favorite song at the moment! <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E> #GirlsGirlsBoys @PanicAtTheDisco #LoveIsNotAChoice 
Girls love girls and boys and love is not a choice.
Never did I think that I would be caught in the way you got me.
Spending the whole day being a domestic goddess reminds me how much I have no desire to ever be a SAHM.
Got hit on in a hotel elevator after I had just finished working out. #SweatyMess #SuperAwkward #NashvilleLife
Sleeping alone is my least favorite thing in the entire world.
No one wants you when you have no heart I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars You'll never know if you don't ever try again So let's try
I am absolutely in love with #Hallelujah! Thank you @PanicAtTheDisco for creating yet another brilliant masterpiece. @brendonurie
I'm not ready to leave it all behind.
Someone please help these raging thoughts to settle down. Cause I can't seem to do it on my own.
I just don't want to cause any regret.
I might get my big city dreams after all.
Nothing better than talking to the one and only @kaitfletch after life throws you several interesting curve balls. #LoveYou #YoureTheBest
You think you have it all figured out and then life decides to change your mind.
I love it when the sky decides to rain so hard you're unable to see for miles so you end up at the wrong hospital. #WhyIDontDrive
@Bizarre_States podcast makes long ass car rides fun.
Luckily, being strong while I'm weak is one of my superpowers.
I don't want to say good bye. I don't want to feel the inevitable pain. I don't want to see you that way.
On the bright side, I get to eat some Bojangles and Chipotle.
Shut up and dance with me.
Tonight I get to forget my problems, but tomorrow I have to face them head on. #JoyDoesNotComeInTheMorning
Loss is a part of love. The more painful the heartbreak, the more love you got to experience. Be thankful for the pain, it means you loved.
Why hello Ms. Numbness, glad to see you remember how to make yourself at home. Stay awhile and make sure Mr. Heartbreak doesn't bother you.
@OrphanBlack comes back tomorrow!!! #SoExcited #LoveMeSomeCosima #CloneClub
@kaitfletch That's awesome! I'm so glad you're feeling better. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> When are you free to chat?
@kaitfletch That's great. Was it celiac? Are you having any issues anymore?
@kaitfletch I've been thinking of you a lot too. We need to skype soon! I'm doing really well. How are you?
Dayyuumm. @AnnaKendrick47 is killing it on @SpikeLSB. #SheSexy #BigBigBooty
Less than a month till #PitchPerfect2 comes out. Guess I need to make a road trip to North Carolina. @kaitfletch
I need someone to tango with me.
Starting the separation process is destroying my heart.
JJ Abrams is the boss. Christmas 2015 is going to be the best one yet. #Stormtrooper
Having big dreams in a small town leads to endless amounts of frustration.
It blows my mind when I listen to songs that used to describe my life. I am so grateful I'm no longer the person I was a year ago. #Growth
I always start off my job search so inspired, but by the end I become completely convinced I'll never get a job. #Hmph #Stress
It took a while, but I finally found myself again.
A thousand times yes!!! 
Any 2016 presidential candidate looking to "crack down" on marijuana is going to lose. #LookAtTheStatistics #GetOverYourself
People aren't good or bad. They make decisions based on what they want and who they want to be. And the beauty is you can always change.
Writing resumes is always so scary because I never think I'm representing myself well enough.
No matter which decision I make, my heart is going to break.
I will not let stress break me. I will use it to drive me to fight for what I want.
When stress and emotions struggle within me all I want is a distraction to help me out.
Just got told I should be homeless for Jesus. #ALittleScared
My desire to wear pants is at an all time low.
I'm so tired of every move I make being in vain. #RunningOutOfTime
Just preordered #Blurryface! Can't wait till May 19th. @twentyonepilots @skeletonclique
I love discovering songs that explain exactly how you feel exactly when you need them.
It's just a bad news kinda day.
I need somewhere I can drive all night
Out into the darkness
Follow the headlights down
I need to know where they can take me
Listening to @NEEDTOBREATHE for the first time wondering why I didn't discover them sooner. #SoGood #SpeakToMySoul
What do you choose when your stuck between what you thought you wanted and what has pleasantly surprised you.
Let the stress and freaking out at me begin. #ItsMovingTime
Super judgmental doctors make me uncomfortable.
The deadline has been set and it's much sooner than expected. #GotShitToDo
Played it safe and went to school. You did what mother and father taught you to... Taught you nothing.

Change?
Unwinding with some @NMTB_TV and puppy cuddling.
Cleaning when you have a dog is pretty much impossible. #MonsterNeedsAttention
Got my car back. Going 24 hours without her was awful. #NeedToGetAway
Glad to see the little island stepping up. #EqualityForAll #ItsAboutLove  
Stress causes stomach issues which causes having to cut out alcohol and good food which causes stress.
My 6 year no bug bite streak has come to an end.
Life is more beautiful living in the unknown.
I really need to find somewhere to ride my longboard.
You know you're overly stressed when you want to run a mile, but can't even stand up without blacking out. #IDontEvenKnow
Instant gratification does not exist.
My adrenaline level is so high right now. I literally can't even handle it. #WhatIsHappening
Is it too much to ask for my life to be a reggae song? #TheChillLife
Listening to music trying to distract myself from the inferno that is my stomach. #INeedAHug
@Zac_Holliday One day. Probably soon.
I need a lifestyle where it's perfectly reasonable to go to concerts every night.
I'm going to start living my life unapologetically. I've wasted too much time not going after what I want.
I just need an off button.
If you want to make it in life, you just don't do it alone.
A lizard ran into my house as I was letting the little monster out. And now I can't find it. #FreakingOut #NotGonnaSleep
Went to the beach for an hour today &amp; forgot to put on sunscreen. Needless to say, I am one red ginger. #GingerProblems
Today is going to be a true test of my self control.
Turned on @rachaelray and saw @chrisdelia. #DayMade
cuddling + the beach + Long Island ice teas = best sick day ever #NeedsToHappenEventually #OrTomorrow
Laying in bed all day listening to great music is one of my favorite things in life. #SickDay
Listening to @dirtyheads while filled with bad vibes is good for the soul. #GivesNothinButGoodVibes #MusicHeals

Easter morning was long but wonderful. Now for some overdue TV and cuddling time. #MissedMyPup #LazyDaze
Got to start the whole job search process again tomorrow. #Stressed #SomeoneHireMePlease
Can't decide what's gonna kill me first: the exhaustion or the need to pee. #VentiFrapp #SoTired
Don't run from happiness, even if you're unsure of how long it will last. #NoteToSelf
Tried Waffle House for the first time today. #IRegretEverything #SoSick
Tentative plan for next weekend: binge 1-6 Fast &amp; Furious movies, then go see the epicness that is #Furious7.
Waiting for answers that decide your fate is unbelievably difficult. #PleaseTellMe #GainingPatience
Cannot wait to spend tomorrow on the beach! #GettingReadyForEaster #HopefullyItWontRain #ProbsGonnaBurn #RedHairDontCare
This is Riley's "WTF Mommy?!?" look. He mostly gives it to me when I dance around the house or make weird noises. 
I really want to go dancing. I just want to lose my mind to the beat of the song and the rhythm of the room. #DancingQueen #SomeoneComeWith
Interviewing at the @BeauBiloxi. Hope it all goes well. #OnlyFreakingOutALittle #GottaBeFierce
Vibing on people is kind of my least favorite activity. #MyLife #NoThankYou #MakeItStop
#WishItWasAPrank @midnight
Going dress shopping alone is the worst. Mostly cause there's no one to tell me how good my butt looks. #BigBootyProblems #GirlMoment
Just a warning, if you pull an April Fool's joke on a red head (especially this one) you may get punched in the face, or die. Just sayin.
As a pup parent, being gone for 12 hours was a really stupid decision. #RileysAMonster #HesSoMadAtMe
My favorite part of @gethardmovie was when @KevinHart4real told the racists to calm the fuck down. #FunnyCauseItsTrue
Easter Sunday is going to be rough. I think a group cuddling session is going to be mandatory. #OverSevenHours #SoMuchStress #LikeABoss
I just want someone to run away with me. #WorldTravelers #WanderLust
I really want to go on a road trip. Leave right now and just spend a couple days enjoying a different place. #MaybeNashville #OrAustin

Favorite moment of @TheWalkingDead was Glenn giving Nicholas a second chance. #ForgivenessIsNecessaryForSurvival
I feel like the creators of @TheWalkingDead are trying to show how deadly white privilege can be. #GlenBetterNotDie

I really hope Owen has the chance to be a dad before @GreysABC ends. #HedBeTheBest

I agree with this in part; however, at some point the hateful need to realize they're wrong. 
Watching The Newlywed Game makes me think I might not suck at the whole dating or marriage thing. #AllAboutCommunication
@EmilyFinlay2 Ikr. It's because they focus on the quality of fans rather than the quality of the fandom. #LookingAtYouCBS

The only thing scarier than the idea of Jeb Bush becoming president is someone letting Mark Cuban play the role. #ScaryShit #DownWithWASPS
Wars are to be fought by groups of men. Forgiveness is given to and by the individual.
As Christians we are not called to condemn even the most evil of humans. We are called to live out the Truth and forgive.
Obama was pointing out that we cannot condemn all the believers of one religion because evil people are using it to do evil deeds.
How anyone can defend the selfish endeavors that were the Crusades, the Inquisition, and slavery is beyond me. #BadActsInAndOfThemselves
The conservative uproar against President Obama's speech just shows how words can be manipulated when heard through biased ears.

When we elevate the lives of government officials or civil servants, we tell others that they are worth less. #EricGarner #WeNeedJustice
We need an equality awakening. All people are equal regardless of gender, sex, orientation, skin color, nationality or profession.
Call me naive, but I don't understand why people can't stop killing. Why would you take another person's life and future away? #sadtweet
Allowing those who enforce the law to be above the law is how militarized countries begin. #EricGarner #WeNeedJustice #NoLifeIsAboveAnother

#YesAllWomen because we are taught we need men to protect us, not that we need to be strong for ourselves.
#YesAllWomen has reminded me why I love writing. I really want to spend my life helping give people a voice and fighting for equality.
#YesAllWomen have the right to follow their dreams, even if those dreams are for an amazing career.
#YesAllWomen because I should not be pitied for being a virgin.
#YesAllWomen because my being content at the idea of being single for the rest of my life shouldn't come as such as such a shock.
#YesAllWomen have to constantly worry if the men in her life have ulterior motives.
#YesAllWomen because I shouldn't have to worry constantly about my little sister having friendships with boys.

People need to question the consequences of military action against Syria, a strong ally of Russia and China. #Syria #walkingintoWW3
Where is Obama's proof that Syria will attack us with their chemical weapons? Where is his proof that the American people are in danger?

“@GingerProblems: I have a soul. #GingerProblems” ...not really...
You know there is something wrong with the world when Russia is suggesting peace, and the American president is demanding support for war.
And he'll ask for support for us entering another war the day before the 12th anniversary of 9/11.
Obama won't create an open ended strike, but he will drop a bomb on a country. Thus allowing the country and its allies to respond.

For more information on HTOR, visit 
Open-source data mining of social media networks is another tool COFS uses to attempt to prevent HTOR.
COFS created a tool called XDOT, which allows the collection and possible prevention of HTOR incidents.
Budiani-Saberi urges her audience to "support victims, and engage in prevention and awareness initiatives."
Advocacy for all forms of human trafficking victims needs to increase through the government and organizations, says Budiani-Saberi.
"COFS offers medical follow-up camps for victims of HTOR in places such as India," said Budiani-Saberi.
Victims of HTOR struggle with many long lasting health, economic, social, and psychological consequences.
States need to implement ways to support victims of HTOR.
"The UNODC (UN Office of Drugs and Crime) was the first to declare HTOR as a punishable crime," Budiani-Saberi said.
"Organ traffickers often do not explain risk or give payment after the organ is given," said Budiani-Saberi.
Misconception #3: Not HTOR if payment is given.
Misconception #2: Not HTOR if consent is obtained.
Misconception #1: Trafficking in Organs vs. HTOR-- The former leaves out the victim.
"There are three main misconceptions of HTOR" said Budiani-Saberi.
Recipients of trafficked organs are subject to rejection of the organ and other health issues concerning the organ.
The United States and Australia are just a few recipient countries involved with organ trafficking.
South Korea, India, and Egypt are just a few of the key host countries involved with organ trafficking.
"Socio-economic conditions should not be determinants for an organ 'donation'," is an idea COFS holds said Budiani-Saberi.
"HTOR is the preferred term for Human Trafficking for an Organ Removal," said Budiani-Saberi.
Dr. Budiani-Saberi is a Medical Anthropologist, and the Executive Director and Founder of the Coalition for Organ-Failure Solutions.
"A Human Rights Approach to Human Trafficking for an Organ Removal" is Budiani-Saberi's title for tonight's speech.
The Transplant Tourism event is led by students from Prof. Furj-Kuhn's Social Work Communities and Organizations class.
Debra Budiani-Saberi, Ph.D. will be speaking at Cedarville University's Community Night about Transplant Tourism.
