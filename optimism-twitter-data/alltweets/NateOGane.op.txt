I'm different, that's what you made me
I'm an optimistic pessimist, hopeful for the future while maintainin my stressin
Don't weep for me because beneath 6 feet is that eternal sleep, deathless dreams
even after death pulls us apart.

Oops I lied
I tried to find God
Love starts flowin like a river, who wants to raft it
Ha
You know you made it when people pretend to care about you.

@TheRealSonReal Have you listened to the rest of Love Story because it's actual fire
Love Story is actually fire.
There will always be a special place in my bank account for you &lt;3
Goodnight.
all me 
Who will you run to that would be this soft and warm, so it's off and on, usually more off than on

See that’s potential wasted, and my potiental’s wastin
Away on women who leave me like they need a vacation



I'm afraid of being the only one committed.
@Brittgrossi cuz its remy boyz or nothin... probably...

"Nah, I have enough of those."

The solution isn't distance

“that is you"
"yeah"
"so why do we talk" 
"because we're masochists"
@IsaacHDL pls no
The sad thing about caring for others is realizing how little they care about you.

Nobody ever asks me if I'm okay y'feel?
I mean the moon is friendzoned pretty hard tbh

Life becomes a lie when you stop giving an f~
LOL 
I kinda wanna move to Canada
I hate reminiscing, I remember how often some people lie


This applies to some recent stuff.
@musicofbelle Why do ya hide your eyes?
The sun rises, the sun sets, the night starts, the night ends.

Some things never change.
Me: I can't I'm writing the Declaration of Independene
Bae: My parents aren't home 
I've never felt better...

I didn't give up playing basketball just because Lebr…

If they cheated once, they'll cheat again. If they left once, they'll leave again. If they stopped caring once, they never cared at all.
The magic is gone

Scared to declare my feelings, unsure of
Depression ain't kill him, he did it with a Smith &amp; Wesson
I feel like telling a story
I can't
@jaysamia Have you heard All Day I mean he's still aight, just needs to get back to soul samples and rappin
@SpotifyCares The card just worked on my sister's account for some reason, just not mine
@SpotifyCares I got a new card after my initial trial period, and I'm putting the new info in so I don't see how that could be a problem
@SincerelyMichy It can also make a hit single. #TheMoreYouKnow
@SpotifyCares I've tried on 2 different devices, iPhone and Android, and my PC, and 2 separate accounts. It just won't take the card.
And she knows...

"no"

sry tht was my friend
I mean it's really working out …

anxiety: im glad you asked

Started off easy, got a little harder and eventually I ended up cheating
Real 
Eh, I'd rather be alone and happy than with a person who I don't really like. Some people take solitude for granted.
bad news: everything is temporary
I hope your titties sag in your early twenties
Told me you loved me but you never told me love hurts
I hope you ruined it for a reason, I hope you're happy
Lemme complain about a problem but make no attempt to fix it, hate who I'm with but love it when I'm with 'em.
I'm just sayin, you could do better.
I've been producing more than writing and rapping. Woops.
I hope every soda you drink is already shaken up
What'd I do this time
You dumb bitch. #inspirational
@SpotifyCares Hey I keep trying to get premium but it keeps saying something is wrong with my card. Not sure why.
Catch the fade

I don't know no pain like what you're going through. Just know I ain't goin nowhere unless it's where you want me to.
squirtle: girls and guys free before 11

I ain't never had stability, so I guess love is a liability, loss is comin inevitably, I just hope you know who you want to be.

Never claimed to be perfect, but I'm perfect for you
Love Yourz
Death is at the end of a long hallway. Everytime you blink it gets a lil closer.
Don't live with your eyes closed.
Cherish the people you have for the time you have them. Love is strong, memories are powerful, and time is short. Stay safe.

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. #PrayforPalm
I didn't know Palm, but from what I've heard he passed with the best intentions. I'm sorry man, rest in piece. World ain't fair.

Tyga: 
@SincerelyMichy Shhhhhh. They're among us. ;)
@thesauceboss998 Somethin like that. He's also immune to fire. Has to record that mixtape.
@thesauceboss998 He was created, not born. The perfect being.
@SincerelyMichy I'm pretty sure the secret society of gophers pays with swag. #TheMoreYouKnow

Check out King Filthy if you haven't! #KingFilthy #Rap
I've seen good friends go and fake friends try to stay

Lost faith in love along the way
I hate when I tell my dog something and it's like maybe if you weren't a dog and you spoke english we could get somewhere

So unreasonable
@jaysamia I do the same thing but with rap
Could write a book called the things hoes say
I'mma swing from this rope after you hang yourself with it
Good can turn bad real quick, it's all circumstantial.
I ain't even sure why I play the game, just know that I do love it though
I AM PHENOMENAL
This hoe is just so versatile
If life is a learning process then I think I'm doing it wrong
Closed eyes close mind

I need to learn to stop playin victim, life happens.
You've built a love but that love falls apart.
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.
Listen to your heart....
                       …
