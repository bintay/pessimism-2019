There is one thing I'm sure of during #finalsweek and that is that there is a 100% chance of tears.
Haven't even opened a book yet and I'm already miserable. #finalsweek
I've been somewhere in between "be with me" and "leave me alone" for the last 3 days.
I miss when you used to get jealous...now it's just me
Never depend on someone else for your own happiness #wise
How can I let someone alter my mood so much
@freehugbot_ Lmao thanks <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Who wants to give me a hug
Am I lame for wanting a relationship and posting on Twitter about it? #probably
<EXPRESSIONLESS FACE><OK HAND SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Why do I even have these feelings
Twitter is my outlet for tonight
I'm always the one left feeling stupid.
I have too many deep feelings. I fall for people way too quickly.
I cared too much and you never cared enough. That's how it's always gonna be with me
You can always count on me to hold on to the past.
Why are my feelings irrelevant to everyone I've ever had feelings for <PENSIVE FACE>
Listening to NSYNC with the sis <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@oddashleee @annaaaabanannaa @leathershirts @mattscool56 I'm confused too

@Kait2011 grandma. It's gotten bad.
You  say you have so many plans for us, yet  when my brother leaves, all you do is hangout at  the bar.
Myyyy sister will bring out a side in me that I can't stand.
I'd rather have no friends than to surround myself around people who haven't grown up.
Some people just need to chill and accept the facts.
So maybe I don't always speak up. #lessdrama
Really sick and tired of certain people treating me like I don't matter unless i'm needed.
I do the most thinking at night. Good, bad, &amp; depressing. #randomthoughts
Each day is one day closer. I can't wait to see my cousin Reed! I'll be so happy. Feel like crying now. Thinking of you guys @RossWichmann
@oddashleee it said I wasn't following you so I did
It's been almost 5 yrs and I still wonder where I'd be now if we never left.
I miss you everyday
After everything, my heart still can't tell you no.
I still wonder if you think of me.
When a song reminds you of him &amp; he's not even yours.
I think too much.
First sunburn of the summer. #Needatan
@oddashleee not like you're taking me anywhere
I find it really cool when my family leaves and doesn't ask me if I'd like to go.
@RossWichmann well I was trying to text you last night because I heard about your leg, but no, couldn't reply lol. Hope you're feeling betr
@oddashleee I didn't. Get a new one.
@oddashleee Make your own fatty
I'm stuck in the past. Brighten my future.
I'm haunted by the memories.
You're not the only one who hurts.
The lyrics in "By The Way" by Theory Of A Deadman describe a lot right now.
Just can't sleep.
Lately I've wondered if anyone has noticed how I feel. I'm always listening to someone else. I have things on my mind too.
Sometimes I look back on the people I grew up with and can't help but wonder, what if?
I post anything that comes to mind. #random
I tweet the most when I'm bored, lonely, thinking of you, and can't sleep. #fact
Looking at a girls picture and thinking "no wonder he likes her, I'll never be that pretty."
@FreeFlyinggg yeah
I wonder if you're thinking of me too.
Music kills the silence. #bestmedicine
FFDP, oh how i've missed you. #goodmusic

@FreeFlyinggg why should it matter to her
@FreeFlyinggg lol I didn't quite understand that story, but your dad called worried about you.
@FreeFlyinggg lol well good but you probably should have left when things got bad.
@FreeFlyinggg you just haven't been yourself over there.
@FreeFlyinggg That doesn't sound fun.
@FreeFlyinggg Yeah. Sure feels that way. You went to your cousins and you changed.

You know why black people only have nightmares, we shot the only one with a dream. Lmao. #mybrothersays

My sister wants to make my dog a twitter. No life.
@FreeFlyinggg haha
I have two best friends in this state. One is acting distant and the other is locked up. I have no social life.
"@WakeBaked: No, you're not gonna die you're just really high. #FirstTimers" @FreeFlyinggg  Classic.
"@TheGoogleFactz: The brain is more active at night than it is during the day." It all makes sense now. #sleeplessnights
@FreeFlyinggg let's hope. Meetme finally has lol. #problemsofanaddict lol.
@FreeFlyinggg this is ridiculous. Lol.
My addiction to twitter is slightly unhealthy and horrible for my data plan.
@MissAnnaBeth13 lol yeah
@MissAnnaBeth13 I'm telling you that other people are stupid.
@MissAnnaBeth13  just a reminder to not let things get to you because high school is just filled with immature people who don't matter
"@meaghancates: #highschoolhastaughtme that im surrounded by the stupidest people alive" @MissAnnaBeth13

Stuck up people. #yourenobetterthantherestofus
Only talking to me when you need something. #ThatsThatShitIDontLike
#YoureMoreAttractiveIf you're family oriented.
When someone complains about a situation/relationship but does nothing to change it. #Quitbitching
Girls who pretend to act stupid. #Notcute
Stay classy. #Respectyourself
#YoureMoreAttractiveIf you don't drink
#YoureMoreAttractiveIf you're confident, but never cocky.

"@MacMilllIer: Loneliness is not a curse, it is a blessing and opportunity to think alone." @FreeFlyinggg
