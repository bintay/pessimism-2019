@marcieaston I briefly remember stopping for the picture.  I was probably scoping the room for more empties.  :)
@marcieaston That's awesome!  I had so much fun that night!
@marcieaston *takes a bow*
@marcieaston I'll always remember the night we first met . . . you put me to work, and I only dropped one beer bottle!  :)
@AmandaStratton I really enjoyed the monthly municipal lunches at City Hall a.k.a Munch.
@PBarmby Absolutely!  How was the knitting this afternoon?
Train 47 has been standing for 3hrs. Props to @VIA_Rail! Staff are making us as comfortable as possible. Forever snacks!  #RemySexsmith
@KarGair I miss you!  And Fruit Salad Fridays.
Representing #ldnont at the #ReducePoverty2015 Summit in Ottawa! #WeNeedAPlan #EndLondonPoverty @LondonCYN @realissue 
Sympathy is dangerous - it marginalizes. We need empathy, not sympathy.  Empathy is what prompts action &amp; change. #ReducePoverty2015
In our @EndPovertyLDN Circles, we stand beside people as they pick their paths. #radicalThinking #ReducePoverty2015
NEWS BREAK: Just me in the press room West Wingin' it #cdnpoli style. 
@JessicaJustrabo @RSueClifford @FemPoliLDN I feel like it's too late to hook you up but I have good drawing skillz + a black t-shirt. :)
@JessicaJustrabo @Tamarack_Inst @VC_Canada Great images!
@RSueClifford @FemPoliLDN I am so excited for my shirts!  I will be home on Friday!
Businesses want to be involved. Go and ask for them to work with you. Ask for the human talent. They have skills we need. #ReducePoverty2015
.@nenshi: Homework - Share what you are learning.  Beyond these walls. Push the conversation further.  #ReducePoverty2015
.@nenshi: Putting people back on their feet helps every single one of us. #ReducePoverty2015
Listening to @nenshi:  The continued existence of poverty keeps me up at night.  It should keep us all up at night.  #ReducePoverty2015
What do we do that sets up barriers? What if we just gave people what they need without intake? Need a coat. Take a coat. #ReducePoverty2015
@London_Colleen THAT's awesome! I have my outfit sorted out, but  it's pretty weather dependent.  If it's hot, I will have to rethink.
Art of Advocacy: Stop awful-izing poverty. Messaging needs to be more optimistic &amp; hopeful. Inspire change. #ReducePoverty2015
"Ending poverty is not a science fiction.  It is coming to a community near you." @doniveson #ReducePoverty2015
The Hon. @Deb_Matthews: We are all better off when those with the least are better off. We all pay the price of poverty.  #ReducePoverty2015
St. Thomas Elgin Circles brought a ball of poverty reduction strategies! #ReducePoverty2015 @JaniceWalt @realissue

@Colleen3558 Oh my Todd!  I forgot all about that!  YES.
@Colleen3558 The cleats were baffling my family every time they got in the car.  Who did they belong to? How did they get there? Why? When?
@Colleen3558 Speaking of littles, I put the cleats in a plastic bag in my mailbox.  You can pick them up anytime.  :)
Not sure why @gabriellafranny doesn't want to go to the mall with me. Is it the Wolverine tshirt? 
Social inclusion promotes acceptance, belonging, caring, recognition &amp; participation! #EndLondonPoverty 
@sherylwillwrite @CMartyna @verypink @AwesomeBioTA Daisy stitch? Brioche looks close too.  Whatever it is, it looks nice.  :)
@st3v3turn3r  I was going in as you &amp; @tanneramma were going out! You missed a lovely rendition of Blackbird.  
@Colleen3558 P.S.  I have tiny soccer cleats in my car that are for you.
@Colleen3558 Remember how I told you all about the knitting group, and then I never showed up????  :)  Thank you for giving me a 2nd chance.
At Kensal Park celebrating youth talent with @PeggySattlerNDP! #ldnont 
@ShawnaLewk You're welcome!  They were so excited! They are going to have so much fun today.  :)
Delivered 1 kid to work &amp; 2 kids to @BresciaUC for the day.  Now I can unhide (&amp; gobble up) my @NoisetteBakery chocolate croissants.
@Colleen3558 @ShawnaLewk How is that possible?  I woke up 20 minutes ago, and I still need coffee to function.
@ShawnaLewk @Colleen3558 Everyone is officially home safely &amp;hopefully sleeping.  :)  That San Pellegrino is going to feel good tomorrow.
@deanaruston It was so great to finally meet you in person today at #SoupnBread!
@EdgarAndJoes Awesome!  We'll be there tonight for the @soho_market!
@middleton_sj I knew I missed something!  It was seeing you!  :)
@chrisloblaw It's always great bumping into you!  It was awesome to see a big crowd out to support the lunch. I haven't stopped smiling.
I'm asking for a friend (really!), does @EdgarAndJoes have chai lattes?
Alpaca sweater + sun = meltedness.  But totally worth raising awareness for #EndLondonPoverty #SoupNBread #ldnont  
Fruit salad Friday is BAAAAAAAAACK!  @KarGair 
It's no art, but now I will have fruit for school lunches tomorrow morning. #TheBrushOff #phew 
Will this be #TheBrushOff winner? 
I'm being outbid at #TheBrushOff! Dang. 
So much to choose from at #TheBrushOff @Goodwill_OGL for @children_museum! 
The most loveliest hamburger! #TheBrushOff 
I am seriously crushin' on the art at #TheBrushOff for @children_museum! 
Join me at #SoupnBread with @LdnHomeless tomorrow @CoventMarket #ldnont 
Thank you @EllipsisDigital for letting me join the team this morning for "weditation" with @PranaLondon - to the smell of @laschicascoffee!
@jameskingsley Before I forget, my newsprint scarf is from @katiewalkerdsgn!
My co-workers know the way to my heart - baked goods.  I am eating Dutch apple fritters from St. Thomas with my post-dinner coffee.  Sigh.
@KarGair I actually wondered who did that?  You are the bestest.
@rouquinne Thank you!  I picked up a dark chocolate bar from @forratsCGM yesterday as a special treat.  It's filled with rasperries!
@st3v3turn3r Thanks!  It's going to be great because I get to hang out with @KarGair!
@RSueClifford Thank you, my friend! My day can NOT NOT be great because I am super awesome! :) #doubleNegative
Get involved! Volunteer, take a sign &amp; donate to @RowlinsonNDP's campaign here -  
@RGwriting I completely forgot about the Frolic!  I have no doubt that it was awesome.  :)
@W_minster_Park It was the amber ale - I can't remember what the name is, but it was perfect.  :)  As were our meals!
My baby beer next to dad's dad-size beer. #londonbrewingcooperative #rootcellar #ldnont 
This morning's sweet haul from the @WFFarmerMkt  #ldnont 
@bookcheckgirl  That's good news!  Which series did she recommend?
It's our turn to host Mother-daughter book club! I scrounged up enough napkins though they're a bit wrinkle-y + battered. #classy #TeaParty
The littlest is a superstar!  She is going to love this when I show her. 
@CanadianCheri I saw you &amp; wanted to say hi &amp; give you a hug, but there were a zillion people in between us.  :)
@KarGair @LDNRoundhouse @EllipsisDigital We also love cheese and fruit @Childreach.
@London_Colleen Oh no!  This makes me sad.
@Colleen3558 Oh dear.
Please nobody pop in for a visit right now. I am wearing two kinds of stripes.  #CallFirstOrTextOrSmokeSignal 
That seems to be the week of girl conferences because Bring It! is 2 days later -  
Know a girl in Grade 7 &amp; 8 who loves I.T.?  @FanshaweCollege's Girls Rock I.T. Conference is awesome! 
The LNC NDP nomination meeting is standing room only! @RowlinsonNDP is starting it off! #ldnont #cdnpoli 
@purple_moose Remind me the next time I am @WFFarmerMkt that I need socks for @Ldntweed
@AwesomeBioTA  There was a lovely tabby with a sweet demeanor. I was set to buy &amp; had to remind myself why we don't have a cat. Yeah, no.
The Canada Building @WesternFair is a dangerous place this afternoon - it's Adoption Day. I don't know how I made it out without a cat.
@st3v3turn3r We missed you, but we understand that you're busy - being awesome!   But we did get lots cleaned up with your family! @KarGair
@RowlinsonNDP You're welcome &amp; thank YOU!  It was a great way to start the weekend - we had 50+ people out to clean!  :)
@KarGair Thank you for coming out this morning!  That was fun!
Our super @ThamesRiverCU crew at Greenway Park this a.m. with @GinaBarber_W9 @RowlinsonNDP @PeggySattlerNDP! #ldnont 
I need to get home and write odes to all my best friends. #poetryslamproblems
@knitty_kat @elanknits @aimee_brewer  It's my fault. I do it to myself.  Plus, is it just me or is there too much cool stuff happening?
@knitty_kat @elanknits @aimee_brewer That's okay because I am booked up until mid-May.  :)
@elanknits Definitely ask!  Fingers crossed for Monday or Wednesday.  :)  @knitty_kat @aimee_brewer @PubMilos
@knitty_kat @aimee_brewer @elanknits Yes to all of this!
@aimee_brewer @knitty_kat @elanknits I remember those!!
@middleton_sj I've thrown my personal books into the library chute by mistake! They treat those as donations. FWIW - I'm a BIG supporter.
@sherylwillwrite I know, right?  My account had been frozen since April 2, and I was getting panick-y.  I need the books!!
@sherylwillwrite Well to be fair, my record was riddled with holds I never picked up. After the lecture, my suspension was lifted.  :)
Today I learned if you place LOTS of holds at the library, you better pick them up, or you will get suspended + lectured. I deserved that.
Sometimes you pack 6 cookies in your lunch &amp; you eat them so quickly that you forgot you ate them.  #IHad6Cookies #WhereDidTheyGo
This Saturday is the @ThamesRiverCU - help clean up along the river! I'll be in Greenway Park - 
@adelatalbot @katiewalkerdsgn It looks like you could also pop into the Curiosities Gift Shop in Wortley!
Hey @adelatalbot! I meant to tell you that I got my scarf from @katiewalkerdsgn - I have the white cotton newsprint with black ink!  #ldnont
I have a hunch that good things were happening @EdgarAndJoes today! @ShawnaLewk @Ryan__Hunt @dbillson @KristenLoblaw #collaborations #lunch
Thanks @this_is_ali! I love Saturday mornings @WFFarmerMkt because of all the connections I make (and the food!).  Cheers!
There are only 3 more days left in the @CBCMusic #Searchlight contest! Vote @W_minster_Park daily! 
@London_Colleen I can pick you up before 9am!  This means we'll miss the train!!  I'm aiming for 8:45.
@AustenGilliland @RachaelAshe @knitty_kat I love that we are all so spread out across Canada, and yet so connected. :)
Is this Rachael Ashe as in @RachaelAshe?  I'm good friends with her sister @knitty_kat!  What a small world,@AustenGilliland!
I totally get that!  I gave away a perfectly good elliptical machine because I wanted room for another couch to sit on.  :)  @calliope4112
Props to @calliope4112 for making my friend's day!  Not only is she giving him a weight machine, she's also offered to deliver it!  #ldnont
@calliope4112 That's amazing!! I am going to let him know &amp; see if we can arrange for transportation!!
Anyone want to donate exercise equipment they have that is just gathering dust? A friend in my @EndPovertyLDN group wants to get in shape.
@CanadianCheri I'm looking forward to our lunch and tour of @childreach tomorrow!  :)
Ditto, @sherylwillwrite. I came away even MORE passionate about building bridges out of poverty.  Also: HOW did I miss @CanadianCheri?
@AustenGilliland A. There's no looking back. :)
@strosow @AbeOudshoorn Thank you!  We should start an LHAC Chair Club. Seriously though, it's good to know who I can turn to for advice.
It's me. I was mentally cursing you @AbeOudshoorn for leaving us for @LMHousingCorp &amp; at the same time channeling your command of the room.
I was nervous, and it wasn't even my first meeting!  :)  @BraveTube @katkaill
Just found a hard plastic gift card with a hole in it &amp; scissors close by. I failed to buy Beah a guitar pick, so she made one herself. #DIY
Pre-turkey family hiking #easter 
@calliope4112 Right? Baking cookies will no longer be a legit workout.
Proof it wasn't snowing 12 years ago today!  We went to the beach &amp; on the way home, stopped for ice cream. 
@CityThink I didn't try a piece of bread.  And stabbing it repeatedly with a butter knife was starting to take a toll on my noodle-y arms.
My life has been changed by those little ceramic discs you soak &amp; then place with old rocks of brown sugar. Colour me impressed.
@Canucklehead_ca You should come out to the @StRegistavern to see @W_minster_Park!  
@chrismcinnis @late2game My dad played the Escape Club's Wild Wild West on repeat for all of 1988.  Once was enough.
Today my boss gave the shoes off of his feet to guy on the street who was wearing just socks.  #ActsOfKindness
I'm reminded that when we speak out, stand up &amp; organize, we create the change we want to see.
Support local musical talent - listen to New Pair of Shoes &amp; give @W_minster_Park a VOTE!  
@RGwriting We missed you!  The good thing is that I'm confident there will be a next time.  :)
I'm also pumped about the loveliest angora knee-high socks I just bought for half price at @purple_moose!  #ldnont #shoplocal
Yo, @KarGair!  There are loaves of SWISS CHARD bread at the Artisan Bakery @WFFarmerMkt.  It's a real thing! #ldnont #SwissChardClub
@orangeheromama We missed you!  :(
We were mother-daughter book club snack heroes with our deliciously awesome @boomboxbakeshop cupcakes! #ldnont 
@Sily_Kim 9am!
@wildflowerwool Yes! :)
@orangeheromama 9am!
@SDesserud NOOOOoooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  One of these days we're going to meet in real life!  It's now my mission.
@kataish I hear you! :)
@knitty_kat @aimee_brewer @London_Colleen This snow s'not cool.
@kataish @devilishone Deets are 9am @fireroastedcafe 2nd floor of @WFFarmerMkt - I'll pick up some apple fritters from the 1st floor.
@aimee_brewer I just thought of more! @RGwriting &amp; @Sily_Kim &amp; @StuartClark's Alicia! #knittersandfritters tomorrow?
@AwesomeBioTA Boo!
@aimee_brewer It can only be a win-win!  :)
@aimee_brewer I'm sure I'm still missing people. Ooh!! @PoeProdigy!  #knittersandfritters tomorrow morning?
@aimee_brewer @MrsCometHunter @devilishone @kataish @wildflowerwool @zalpacas @orangeheromama #knittersandfritters tomorrow?
@aimee_brewer @slowlygoing @officeprincess @BooksYarnLogic @ldnBrian @bungibson @AwesomeBioTA @SDesserud #knittersandfritters tomorrow?
@marcieaston If you need help convincing your employer that this training would benefit business, let me know.  :)
@aimee_brewer @knitty_kat I can be there shortly after 9am! Unfortunately  @London_Colleen is out of town this weekend.
The next Bridges Out of Poverty training is April 8 @Goodwill_OGL. I can't say enough good things about it. 
I got an impromptu tour of @MySistersPlace yesterday &amp; I love their awesome space &amp; positive welcoming vibes. #CelebratingSisterhood
Will this be the day that Josh takes down the outdoor xmas lights? #QuestionsIAskMyselfEveryDay #3MonthsLater
@BraveTube Then it wasn't Deb.  She's been on the LHAC for a while.  Sounds like maybe it was Betsy.  She's new to the committee too.
@BraveTube She wears glasses, but I don't know about her coat.  :)  It will be a mystery until the first LHAC meeting!
@BraveTube Was her name Deb?
@1191601 We could make this even easier if we just shared our calendars.   See you soon, my friend!  Somewhere.  :)
@KristenLoblaw Very fitting!  :)
.@DHMakerBus I have a few humans who will definitely want to be a part of this! :)  @Awesomeldn #ldnont

@MGirash  Sugar.  I just found it online - 
@MGirash Yes!  The crumble included walnuts - yum!  And I threw in 5 old strawberries too.  For good measure. :)
Rhubarb-banana crumble is where it's at.  I would never have guessed.
@zalpacas Beah &amp; I had so much fun at this workshop!  :)  Maybe we'll have to come out and visit the alpacas soon.  And you!
@MrsCometHunter @naturallycaren Agreed! I needed that! :)
@markspowart17 Well, your photography skills are easy to sell!  :)  Cheers!
@markspowart17  @RowlinsonNDP Matthew needs some head shots.
@ShawnaLewk Congrats!
@berrybrandi I was the same! Registering my babies somehow made going back to work a little too real.  :)
@berrybrandi In my experience, many child care centres aren't good at reaching out and engaging families.
@berrybrandi  Oh dear! I don't think it would hurt to make some phone calls to the centres on the top of your list.
@berrybrandi The lack of childcare spaces is also an issue!  Did you use the City's waitlist site?  
Writing + listening to an old favourite - 
THIS best-mum-ever just bought TWO giant tubs of @LdnIceCreamCo ice cream. #staycation #ldnont
@MrsCometHunter I have it in my calendar, but if it's not a good week, we can go another Friday. @naturallycaren could join us too!
@MrsCometHunter Nope.  I took March Break off, and I'm hanging out with the girls.  :)  Have fun though!  We still on for Friday?
@BraveTube That's great!  I'm impressed.
@BraveTube Maybe!  I'm waffling between it and the Women &amp; Transit event at City Hall.  So many places to go &amp; not enough time. :) #ldnont
We need a business-community effort like @pathwayrep in #ldnont to confront the issue of living wage like this - 
It's a good day when you are craving something sweet &amp; you find cookie dough in the freezer + cherry nibs in the cupboard. #treasures
@kvl We are Machi Koro fans at our house.  Santa got it just in time for Christmas from @ubercoolstuff.  :)
Fave part of our road trip was the tiny toilet. 
@KarGair @NannieAnne11 I  knew this would happen.  Now it will be OLD old food.
Road trip to Guelph Civic Museum. We can't seem to escape Wes Anderson. #GrandBudapestHotel 
@FPVmuseum You bet!
@NannieAnne11 @KarGair The ones in the bag are all gone!  There might be some rock-hard rectangular ones left.
@KarGair @NannieAnne11 Let's remember crackers.
@NannieAnne11 @KarGair I was a bit uncomfortable for a couple hours post-old brie, but I drank some water and pulled through.
For #tbt I bring you my first visit to @FPVmuseum with the littlest - 
@KarGair We should have changed @NannieAnne11 to hashtag-mom-boss or hashtag-boss-mom.  Hashtag-so-much-regret.
@KarGair @NannieAnne11 I hope you're right &amp; we don't end up violently ill. Then old food will be bad food. #StomachsOfSteel
@NannieAnne11 @KarGair I love you both alot, but I think it's really weird that you are both up for eating antique food, but no gluten. xoxo
Absurdly happy that I remembered to replenish our supply of rolled oats today.  I predict muffins on top of muffins on top of muffins.
Today is a mint pants kind of day.  I blame it on the balmy spring weather.
@jeremygreenway I could see this!
@jeremygreenway I'm just thinking Kate might be cold, and she will want in.  :)
@jeremygreenway Check your windows.
@jeremygreenway BEST way to wake up EVER.
@KarGair That's possibly the most beautiful-est tweet picture I've ever seen. #SwissChardClub
@RowlinsonNDP That's funny! Glad you could make it this morning!
Just spotted @AnnaHopkins11 at the #povertysim!  Good to see #ldnont city councillors here to participate.
Bridges out of Poverty is about reducing the barriers in poverty.  Get involved with @EndPovertyLDN - there is a training day in April!
Take this understanding and information, and let it shock you into action.  #povertysim
It's not about pulling yourself up by the boot straps. We need to change the narrative of poverty.  #povertysim
We know so much about poverty, so we should be doing a better job at eliminating it.  #povertysim
People do not fall into poverty.  They are pushed into it.  #povertysim
New faces of poverty are emerging - the working poor, minimum wage, no benefits, precarious employment - who will are society discard next?
Poverty is about relationships of exclusion. We live in a divided city.  Some can shop at grocery store. Others must go to the food bank.
There are 2300 families on the social housing waitlist. #povertysim
In London &amp; Middlesex County, there are 80,000 individuals living in poverty.  #povertysim
@RSueClifford @naturallycaren @AwesomePeople We're sitting beside each other!!  :)
Frustrated that I couldn't provide for my family.  Got a lot of misinformation which caused me to waste time.  #povertysim
Helplessness RE: system - Is the 1.5 hours to get to the appointment worth what I may or may not get at the appointment?  #povertysim
Frustration and anger trying to navigate the system. There is no time to listen and really care about families. #povertysim
I was a young child. Had to watch my mom make hard (poor) choices that would impact my family such as payday lending. #povertysim
Felt bad for hesitating to help someone else out.  I couldn't meet my own basic needs.  #povertysim
At the very end, I was tempted to commit crimes, so I could be sent to jail.  #povertysim #survival
If it had been winter, I would have been dead.  I was homeless and hungry.  There was no empathy.  It was terrifying.  #povertysim
As a homosexual homeless teenager, I felt isolated and didn't have a sense of belonging. I felt like giving up.  #povertysim
As a child, I was bored.  I couldn't do what other kids were doing.  I became increasingly angry.  #povertysim
Getting a job was life-transforming.  Could finally turn things around.  #povertysim
Issue of housing was a constant stress.  Calls from school, not enough food, children exposed to adult problems . . .  #povertysim
Debrief at #povertysim - It was dehumanizing.  The service providers cared more about bus tickets and ID rather than my hunger.
Debrief at #povertysim - Can't trust anyone. Very frustrating. Trying to keep the impact of poverty away from my children, but impossible.
Where to start and how to prioritize when there are so many problems?  #povertysim
Finding solutions to survive.  Had to be selfish. Had to pay fees to end monthly expenses.  Felt punishing. #povertysim Could NOT get ahead.
Bad things were piling up. The system wasn't helping me keep my family together. #povertysim
There was no time to spend with my family.  Emotional chaos. So much loss.  #povertysim
No one would help me without ID.  Taking a risk meant losing other things and starting over again. #povertysim
Debrief at #Povertysim "stressful, anxious, lonely, hole we were in kept getting deeper"
Week 3 is over.  One more week left.  The participants appear tired.  And most likely they are hungry.  #povertysim
Week 3 - Listening to some VERY creative explanations/stories from participants seeking help.  #povertysim
It's hard waiting in line and then hearing that you can't be helped. #povertysim
5 minutes left of Week 1 #povertysim - participants are frustrated.  Lots of long lines at service providers.

@knitty_kat Well, I'm back on Housing Advisory, I've still got my weekly Circles dinner &amp; I have a sweater that needs seaming up!  :)
@London_Colleen Enjoy the next two days making music!  It's going to be freaking fantastic!  :)
I love you, @Colleen3558! It also JUST occurred to me that I owe you $ for that retreat!  I'm putting it on my list of to-dos.
Yes @ShawnaLewk!  Having done it, I see the potential in every woman around me. And I put a lot into it, but I got WAY more back in return!
Thank you @PeggySattlerNDP for sharing your experience and giving me hugs just when I needed them.  :)  My girls adore you!
Thank YOU @ShawnaLewk for asking me.  Thanks for making me see that I have what it takes.  :)
@CWChapter2 Thank you, my friend.
@ShawnaLewk That's funny you should mention @LondonYAC.  She applied to be a reporter, was interviewed &amp; got the job!   :)
@ShawnaLewk Agreed!  Let's get her through university and then we'll  #askher!
Congratulations @RowlinsonNDP!  You ran an excellent campaign!  I look forward to helping you win this election!  #cdnpoli #ndp
Today I lost the NDP LW nomination, but I achieved so much more than I ever thought I would. Thank you to everyone who believed in me.
@ShawnaLewk That's kind of you!  I'm pretty sure that she is going to have a great career in writing &amp; speaking.
I was trying not to listen too much so I wouldn't start crying.  :)  I'm super glad that I get to be her mum.  @ShawnaLewk @LondonWestNDP
Thanks @BraveTube!  I was so thrilled that you &amp; Sophie joined us this afternoon!  I'll be seeing you monthly at LHAC meetings! :)
THANK YOU @London_Colleen!  I could not have gotten this far without you!  :)

Thanks @StuartClark!
@rouquinne Thank you!!!!!
Tomorrow is the @LondonWestNDP Nom Mtg! I'm ready! It's been an amazing journey. #cdnpoli
@nataliese I found a butter tart wrapped in a napkin once, and it was perfectly fine.  :)   It totally hit the spot.

While watching the littlest's basketball game,  I got my 1st non-family\friend NDP lawn sign ask. Now I really need to win. :) #cdnpoli
@ShawnaLewk @lifespinorg I have had this on my list of to do's. :)
Spent the night on mum tasks - taking the littlest to basketball &amp; tween council, baking muffins for lunches &amp; making sure homework is done.
Only 1 hour left to bid on some great family-friendly items in @childreach's online silent auction! 
We raised double our goal for @Mission1951! 
@sherylwillwrite @PPL4Door2Door @irenemathyssen I'll look into this!   I still need one for my front lawn!  :)
@SarahQuinoa Thank YOU, Sarah!  :)
@SarahQuinoa @Mission1951 Absolutely! Look up the Homeless Avengers on 
#cnoy #ldnont 
#cnoy #ldnont @Mission1951 
Great day for canvassing with  @PPL4Door2Door &amp; @irenemathyssen! #ndp #DayofAction 
@BraveTube It was nice to see you too!  I'm looking forward to our monthly Housing Advisory Committee meetings!
Grilled cheeses + hot chocolate = bestest lunch. @rtraction &amp; @EdgarAndJoes  &amp; @GoodahTruck
Listening to Records in My Room by @W_minster_Park  
@RSueClifford You're forgiven.  You only spent the day helping build a home for a family in need.  :)
Me: It doesn't matter if they're crushed or whole.  Tomatoes taste the same.
@gabriellafranny: You can't say that about hearts.
Me: True.
Hey, @London_Colleen @Canucklehead_ca @RSueClifford @Reddwulf &amp; @kezzaloudoun!  We reached our fundraising goal!  
@KarGair @st3v3turn3r If this was a FOR-REAL-LIFE duel, C would win hands down.
@st3v3turn3r @KarGair That's funny.  I tweeted, then thought, "I forgot to hashtag it #nobiggie."  :)
@KarGair This is the quintessential C picture.  Just chillin' with a lollipop in her mouth &amp; petting a mammoth snake.
My Valentines Day card - hand drawn by Beah ♡ 
@London_Colleen The bank machine at @WFFarmerMkt let me have my money!  It is the best day! :)
Oh how I wish I was 10 again so that I could go back and spell Celsius with a capital C.  
@DanHilton74 I agree!  I'm honestly excited for whoever wins the nomination.  :)
Oh my goodness!  @purple_moose Are those in the store at this very minute?  I'm thinking VALENTINES day!
Me too, @RowlinsonNDP! It was a lovely evening!  Better yet, I just found a butter tart in my purse. @PeterisBergman1 @LondonWestNDP
@DanHilton74 It was great to meet you in person at tonight's meeting!  Thank you for introducing yourself.  I'm looking forward to March 19!
Right back at both of you!  @London_Colleen @RSueClifford
@edjackman Try Ryan Mahy from @ArtfusionCA.
You're very welcome, @RSueClifford!  Anytime!  I had fun hiding behind the wall.  :)
@ShawnaLewk We haven't actually dragged her out to determine that yet. I picked up the snowshoes after last winter. It's on our to-do list.
@ShawnaLewk That's crazy!  Snowshoeing is where it's at.
@ShawnaLewk Absolutely!
@ShawnaLewk I also saw snowshoes at Giant Tiger for $40.  Or maybe a little less.  Not the best, but they work fine.
@ShawnaLewk I have 4 pairs of snowshoes you can borrow - at least two of them are smaller than large?  I'll check when I get home.
@AwesomeBioTA @MsAGilbert I see an epic knitting date in our future.
I have the bestest sort of friends - @MsAGilbert! She is a testament to strength &amp; resilience. 
@Colleen3558 Ewwwwww!  That's a good one.  I may borrow it.
@Colleen3558 Titanic would most definitely be the WORST!   This was more of the ship being overbooked or not getting that balcony &amp; view.
@Colleen3558 I just sat through a half hour convo on cruises-gone-bad stories.  It was hard, but I managed not to roll my eyes.  :)
@MrsOceanstream Actually @lifespinorg is on twitter!  Jacqui, is the Free Store accepting donations?
@AbeOudshoorn  Not surprisingly, this was one of my very first considerations for running, my friend. :)
Want to join me &amp; @PPL4Door2Door tomorrow afternoon to save good jobs &amp; advocate for those w/mobility issues? 
@lfay_lorraine Thank you!!  I can tell you have a big heart!  :)
@lfay_lorraine  It's so nice to know that there are advocates of change like you in our community!
@lfay_lorraine We can definitely do better by our aging population - safety, healthcare, social net, supports, pensions - all important.
@virginia_ridley Agreed! We must do better in terms of affordable QUALITY childcare. With more than 1 child, fees can cost more than rent!
Thanks, @BrandonTozzo!  All the best getting @DanielJBeals elected!
@BrandonTozzo @PeggySattlerNDP My family could tell the same exact stories. :(  More than half of new jobs created are P/T, contract &amp; temp.
Thanks @BrandonTozzo I had GOOD jobs as my #1 too!  Glad to know I'm on the right track.  :)
Live in London West? What do YOU feel is the most important issue in the upcoming federal election?  #cdnpoli #ldnont
@AwesomeBioTA @BooksYarnLogic  Good to know! I've decided to forego making dinner for the teen's b-day dinner this year - I'm a bit busy. :)
@DanHilton74 Thanks!  I love supporting #oevldn!
@whurl1968 I DO like ben thanh!!  I hadn't thought of them.  Thanks!
Looking for take-out pad thai recommendations. #ldnont
I wrote today's @childreach blog post - The Adventures of Flat Stanley!  
This is my fave pic from 3 yrs of walks! @London_Colleen @RSueClifford @gabriellafranny &amp; @BeahLearn #cnoy 
Last year we were gearing up for the @coldest_night &amp; it's coming up again. 
@JessicaJustrabo Sadly, no. I'm at home working on campaign stuff. (And eating raspberry bugaboo ice cream from @LdnIceCreamCo).
Thanks @OFLabour &amp; @CanadianLabour for allowing me join you tonight to understand the issues &amp; show my solidarity. #cdnpoli
Thank you @RSueClifford! I'm incredibly lucky to have the support of such awesome people.  I dedicate this to you - 
@kledgley I thought you would enjoy it!  :) I was laughing so hard reading it.  It happened exactly like that.  And Beah was so little!
Hey, @kledgley &amp; @children_museum!  Just dug out one of my OLD blog posts that you will LOVE! 
Have some junk piled around your house to get rid of? Call @ImpactJunk. Social enterprise + mental health + green = WIN-WIN. #BellLetsTalk
@KarGair I hope there are more pictures than this.  :) #BellLetsTalk (I'm just adding that to every tweet today because I can.)
Thanks @PPL4Door2Door! It's in my calendar!  :)
Live in LW? Want a say in who will be the NDP federal election candidate? Only 3 days left to join- 
@rouquinne That's if they make it through the night!  4 tarts have disappeared so far &amp;1 kid doesn't know they exist yet.  :)
Talked to @GinaBarber_W9 about butter tarts today, so I HAD to bake some. CONFESSION: My shells are store-bought. 
Speech writing and dancing CAN be done simultaneously. 
@jesse_helmer My #1 would be funding a program that keeps families in their homes. #ldnbudget15
Agreed!  They are where it's at!  :) @1191601 @dynamicdozen
And I wish the @dynamicdozen would teach me some dance moves.  We will need to start with the basics.  #footloose #ldnont
Finally got a chance to hear @AeolianHall's  El Sistema  at @PeggySattlerNDP's New Year's Levee today! They sang Brave beautifully. #ldnont
I'm wearing my @Carminadeyoung infinity scarf this morning, and I'm getting LOTS of compliments!  :)  #LdnOnt #shoplocal
Code drives innovation &amp; success. Learn to code for free @TheHTML500 &amp; be part of #ldnont's digital future. 
@rachelberdan I hope these alfalfa sprouts negate the years of Mr. Noodles. I need to start sprouting my next batch of seeds ASAP.
Our picky eater just grabbed a bowl of alfalfa sprouts for dessert.   I'm winning at this mum gig.
@sherylwillwrite Glad you found socks! :)  Thank you for arranging coffee. If we're lucky, we'll bump into each other again this morning!
@RGwriting Welcome back, my friend! :)
When the teen calls to say she's on her way home &amp; I tell her that there's tea &amp; freshly baked muffins ready, everything is as it should be.
@kevindividual Thanks.
@kevindividual I just muttered to myself, "There better be a twitter in the future!", and there were some giggles behind me.
@NachoKristine @CanadianCheri Might I suggest the @TheWoolBoutique at @WFFarmerMkt?  #ldnont
@Reddwulf @RSueClifford I just saw that!  Awesome!  P.S. Dress warm.
And we have buttons left from last year! @Canucklehead_ca @RSueClifford 
Yes! @ShawnaLewk  She is pretty excited!  She would be excited on top of excited if A &amp; M were doing it too!
It's easy!  Here's the link to our page - 
.@RSueClifford Whoa!  @Canucklehead_ca just joined us too! :)  #BestDayEver
Want to join The Homeless Avengers? We have @kezzaloudoun @London_Colleen &amp; @RSueClifford! 
I'm glad that I put a pot of tea on before I went out to shovel.  I needed that warm treat when I returned!
@OnedayDesigns I have to thank my little family for that one!  :)  Thanks, Linda!
@jodisimpson Thanks, Jodi! :)
@SDesserud I believe it's February 28!  I only know of one person also running, but there could be others.  I've been trying to find out.
It would be my honour and a privilege to represent you, @RSueClifford!  :)
@chrismcinnis Thanks, Chris!
@virginia_ridley Thanks, Virginia!
@StuartClark Thanks, Stuart! :)
@chrisloblaw Thanks, Chris! It helped to see a lot of my awesome friends step up in the municipal election. :)
@anma_sa That's awesome!  Interested in joining the party? :)
@KristenLoblaw Thanks, Kristen!
It's official! I'm running in the London West NDP nomination contest. I'm pretty excited. 
@RSueClifford @MrsOceanstream @London_Colleen we'll be there 'bout 9:15! :)
@andrearoth888 Happy New Year!
Family movie night #StudioGhibli #SpiritedAway #NYE2015 
@London_Colleen @MrsOceanstream Pickle trays for everyone!
@London_Colleen I hope you rescued a pickle tray. :)
Thanks @purple_moose for the parking lot sock exchange yesterday!  @gabriellafranny LOVES her new PUG socks! 
There are three deer grazing in the front yard. Love my neighbourhood.
@jamesshelley And a Merry Christmas to you too, James!  :)
@London_Colleen One can never have enough cheese.  Amirite?
Want to know what's better than dried apricots?  Dried apricots dipped in dark chocolate.
@ShawnaLewk I'm certain you're not referring to the ginger molasses crinkles &amp; shortbread snowballs. :)
On today's to-do list: bake cookies, craft a communication plan, vacuum, open a bank account, wrap gifts &amp; dream about the future.
@st3v3turn3r We need to get you a selfie stick stat.  @KarGair - make note of this on your christmas shopping list.
Finally picked up @Mo_kenney's newest album while downtown @Grooves_Records. It's going in the driving music rotation with @W_minster_Park.
Time to queue up some holiday movies &amp; get out the oranges and cloves for some merry making.
Lots of shopping done today! @purple_moose @WFFarmerMkt @SaucyCo @LeeValleyTools @ubercoolstuff &amp; Neo Tokyo! @LondonGetsLocal #ldnont
Tonight we ended yoga by setting our intentions for 2015. I wrote down that I will be the hero I need &amp; wear my quirks proudly. I have this.
@kimmm_edwards @LondonGetsLocal  @boomboxbakeshop @patricksbeans @PristineOlive @purple_moose Me too! I won last Friday!  :)  Love this!
@anma_sa My kids seem to think so!  :)
For #tbt I give you little Nadine on a button.  Because everyone should be able to wear their younger self. 
The Best of 2014 - my Circles family @EndPovertyLDN + @gabriellafranny going to @westernu + new City Council. That's just a start.
@certifiable_1 @kevindividual I should have introduced you two at the @childreach soup &amp; chili lunch!  :)  Those 2 hours are a total blur.
It's 3 hrs later  &amp; NOW I get the dress code, @London_Colleen!  I liked your holiday-themed attire.
@LondonGetsLocal Woo-hoo!!!  Email is sent!  THANK YOU!  :) #londongetslocal
@LondonGetsLocal Describe gardening? I'd say it's something I leave up to my husband. :) 
#LondonGetsLocal
Great to see a full house at Centennial Hall for tonight's dramatic reading of A Christmas  Carol in support of the Unity Project. #ldnont
@ShawnaLewk Always lovely spending time with you and the girls!  Now to initiate Project Osage Oranges. :)
@CityThink I'm thinking 6?
@late2game I can think of so many deserving orgs. But 1 that has impacted me? TVCC's speech therapy helped us understand the littlest. :)
@ShawnaLewk @KarGair  I love that they all love each other.  But next time they are all wearing bright pink &amp; red head to toe &amp; lights.
@ChildreachAnne Oh no! Thankfully by that point you had heard the oath 10 times.  :)
The most awesomely blurriest picture ever. That there is our newest ward 11 councillor.  :) #ldnont 
That's my girl at 0:39!  
@purple_moose I was going to come, but it looks like I'm heading out of town to visit a friend! Please send my regrets to Suzanne. :(
 
@Colleen3558 Maybe that's it.  If you like doing it, it's not work.  :)
Why does it feel like a lazy day when I've vacuumed, cooked &amp; cleaned everything? I've done less work at work. Is it the jammies?
Must schedule more date nights w/ @gabriellafranny - I haven't laughed like that in ages. I'm crazy lucky to have such a cool cat 4 a kid.
@VIA_Rail Luxury couples escape without a doubt! #VIArailtrip
Join me in giving to #charity this #GivingTuesdayCa. Get $10 charitable dollars from @wearechimp!  
@C0mmunityG33k The objective is to be the first to build your town.  It was a lot of fun - we may have to buy one for under the xmas tree!
Machi Koro is our new favourite board game!  #projectplay @ProjectPlayLDN #ldnont 
Jackpot! I just found 3 pairs of socks I knit last spring that have never been worn. 
@adeburger I LOVE this!  :)  Thanks!  Good to know for the next one.  In the past, I've just cut them, and it's ridiculously messy.
@LameAlias I was method-less.13 mins into the pomegranate, I wondered aloud if googling would B effectiver. I will look up the water bowl.
As I painstakingly dismantled a pomegranate for the littlest, I vocally noted that she had won the mum lottery.  She agreed.
@virginia_ridley My neighbours did!  I saw them dragging their sled home &amp; I thought to myself, "What a good idea!" &amp; then I forgot.  :)
@PeggySattlerNDP @broadbent @InequalityFilm So jealous!
.@KarGair I dreamt that we used our scrabble letters to make 'KAIR' - a combo of Karen + Gair.  And we won star-shaped cookies. #PCIA14
Jeff Flesher has it right! Surround yourself with fantastic people &amp; you can't help but succeed. #PCIA14 Success is a choice.
Inspired by the nominated leaders at  #PCIA14 - how do you choose just one? #ldnont
Love the @CouponForHunger ladies! #PCIA14 They give so much of their time and expertise!
We got 'ROOK'  &amp; 'AIR' x2 for 12pts. #PCIA14  I wish we had BLURG. @KarGair 
@ldnBrian I, too, felt like this after my drive home from Ingersoll on the 401 this afternoon.  :)
@W_minster_Park All of them! Carol of the Bells, Angels We Have Heard on High, Happy Christmas (War is Over), Joy to the World . . .
You're brilliant @AwesomeBioTA!  Now I recall someone calling it a zebra plant ages ago!  @RSueClifford - Go forth &amp; find one! Heck, find 5!
@RSueClifford I have no idea. Maybe @AwesomeBioTA might know. I just know that it survives on no daylight and water 1-2 times a week.
This morning my office plant was dead from missing me.  Now it has forgiven me for being gone all weekend. 
@StuartClark No doubt!  I think Laurie used to say knitting is cheaper than therapy. It's true!  :)
@StuartClark There's definitely some truth in that.  :)
@RSueClifford You cleaned up at @lifespinorg's Chocolate Sunday raffle! :)  Sorry I missed you!
4 feet away from our front window sit 2 blue jays, 2 cardinals &amp; 10 chickadees in our weeping willow tree - reason #485 I have no curtains
@lifespinorg Oh good!  I will be there in plenty of time!  :)
@lifespinorg When does the bidding end?  I'm coming a bit later, but I don't want to miss out on the silent auction.  :)
Drinking hot water with a slice of lemon, a spoonful of honey + a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger in hopes of warding off any sickness.
thelovingpath at the Waldorf handmade holiday sale - open until 8pm today #ldnont 
@London_Colleen Heck yeah! I feel like we get even better with age.
@London_Colleen Can you believe that we've been friends for 20+yrs? And parents for almost that long? We're going to have 19yr olds soon! :)
@ChildreachAnne Well, that's not fun at all. :(
@ChildreachAnne @KarGair @PDibby81 Why not?  Hats for EVERYONE!!! :)  And then I'll knit you some snowpants.
The @Childreach team wearing purple to #shinethelight on @endwomanabuse.  @KarGair @ChildreachAnne @jane1231cat 
Last year I forgot so I'm making up for it today with purple pants, purple shirt &amp; purple sweater. #shinethelight @endwomanabuse #ldnont
.@RSueClifford I'm going to skip breakfast to make room for the chocolate fountain!  #ChocolateSunday #ldnont
@BRJJharvey Agreed! We're excited!
@BRJJharvey TWINS! My girls &amp; I do LOTR + HP late-night movie-a-thons every winter break! :)
Perfect Sunday evening listening to some @Mo_kenney with a cup of tea, a dutch apple fritter + my knitting. 
@ldnBrian I saw @bungibson's Baby Suprise Jacket on FB!  It's making me want to knit another one!  But must tackle xmas knitting first!
@wildflowerwool I may even add a glass of wine after I return from picking up the teen from work.  :)
A productive day-market, thrifting, playdate, roasted butternut squash soup, pumpkin gingerbread muffins &amp; cleaning cupboards. Now to knit.
The worst - best concert pic! #mokenney 
@ShawnaLewk @Colleen3558 It would certainly be a hoot, but I've got a nice quiet weekend of hiking, baking, reading &amp; knitting planned. :)
@ShawnaLewk @Colleen3558 Of all the women I know, you two are certainly the worthiest of a weekend getaway!  Rest &amp; drink up! :)
@MrsOceanstream @Childreach I'll be there in half an hour! :)
@London_Colleen @RSueClifford I don't know about THAT!  I'm certainly not making it horrible. See what I did there? Agree by opposite? :)
@RSueClifford I'm currently on the Housing Advisory Committee. Want to join me? :)
@andrearoth888 I'm adding Maleficent to our movie-watching queue. Enjoy your date night with Ava!
@London_Colleen Those all make sense!  :)
@London_Colleen How 'bout you?
@London_Colleen Housing again.  I'm just getting into the groove of it.  :)
@London_Colleen I have seen it!  Love the music.  :)
@andrearoth888  I am SO looking forward to doing nothing. I might even throw in a bowl of popcorn &amp; a tall glass of gingerale. #PartyOf1
@andrearoth888 Hang in there! You have this! :)
Not excited about the dentist tomorrow, but the Mo Kenney concert at the @AeolianHall should make up for it. 
@London_Colleen Sorry!  I'm out every night this week. I have a date with my couch Friday night.  :)
Drove by pro-lifers at Commish/Wellington &amp; the teen rolled down window to yell THANKYOU to a young guy w/SORRY-2-all-women sign. #CoolKid
Thinking about investing in a fog machine.
"I have something to say." Cue fog.
"Your dad's home." Cue fog.
Everything else. Cue fog.
@KarGair When Claire answered the door, I asked her point blank if she was following me around. :)  Sorry I didn't make it back! I crashed.
Half of the Learn family is watching Soylent Green on the living room wall.  Should I be terrified? What will the neighbours think?
Halloween Witch 
@TothSusan @jennifertozer My littlest answered the phone, listened and hung up.  When I asked who it was, she responded, "A robot."  :)
Hey @foodboxproject!  We LOVED this week's arctic kiwis!  They tasted JUST like kiwis except they looked like berries!  Big props!
@CGMcCauley Ditto!  There was so much positive energy in the room!  Though I'm a wee bit tired this morning! :)
Kudos to @London_Colleen for the #30Days2Vote challenge &amp; engaging voters &amp; giving them the tools to make informed decisions!  #ldnvotes
The littlest noted that tonight was to me what ComicCon was to her.  She may have been referring to my pure joy. #DreamCouncil #ldnvotes
@KarGair You're so close! :)  See you soon!
@CityThink @virginia_ridley Clear the roads!!!  :)
@virginia_ridley  Maybe @CityThink?
Just googled "What can I make with a million rainbow loom bands?", and I found out you only need 250,000 to make a man's suit. #fact #4suits
SING it, @_Andrea_Brown!  This is why I'm so proud to call both you &amp; @Matt_Brown_ friends!  
@RSueClifford @jesse_helmer @DelSuze @MrsOceanstream @London_Colleen @ronnyzoo That was FUN!  :)
At the St. Regis tapping my foot to Westminster Park #ldnont 
@KarGair As you should.  I love auto correct AND I hate it equally. *shakes fist*
@KarGair I know you meant 'hanging'.  :)  Have fun out there this morning!  I hope you have a cup of tea somewhere.
Dropping literature off in Ward 11! Vote Stephen Turner! 
@MrsOceanstream You're welcome!  Anytime! :)
The @boomboxbakeshop website looks Sah-WEET!  And of course it's designed by @warpaintmedia!
@knitty_kat I have no idea!
Spotted the @PillarNN team at Central &amp; Richmond with 
@knitty_kat The 18 year old is finally getting a real hair cut!  She has more than enough to make a donation.
Life as a teenager is setting your alarm to wake up so you don't miss a 1pm hair appointment.
Last week to drop off gently used winter coats &amp; gear for Koats for Kids!  
@London_Colleen I've only knit 15% of the cowl I need done by Saturday. I went hiking today instead of hunkering down to git er' done. :(
Happy @FC3_COMICON Day!  My family has been waiting FOREVER for this day! #ldnont
This is exactly why I voted @Matt_Brown_ for Mayor. He has the experience, skills and heart!  
@PeopleofLdnOnt It was @London_Colleen's idea to get the bouquet &amp; I wanted in on that action. :)   Well deserved!
@rouquinne It was awesome to meet you too today!  I love that the twitterverse has gifted me with so many new kindred spirits.   :)
@Adinagator @London_Colleen You're welcome!  :)  Happy Saturday!
@AwesomeBioTA I'm just looking myself.  At the level it is now, the yarn stash will outlive me.  @SDesserud @London_Colleen
@SDesserud @London_Colleen @PeopleofLdnOnt In the building to the west of the building with all of the string &amp; sticks.
@KarGair Oh my goodness!  I hadn't watched the whole video!  You &amp; lil Turner are naturals! :)
@middleton_sj @_Andrea_Brown It was an amazing piece of work.  I can't wait for more people to see it!  #25PercentDoc #MovieNight
Hanging with some superstars at the #25PercentDoc! @_Andrea_Brown @1191601 @katkaill  #ldnont 
@PeopleofLdnOnt Last one for now!  
@PeopleofLdnOnt I'm on a roll!  This is a good one that demonstrates that the @CityofLdnOnt is at our service - 
@PeopleofLdnOnt This one is good too! 
@PeopleofLdnOnt The @LondonEDC has some good videos about #ldnont!  
@ShawnaLewk I've been having auto-correct issues here too!  I totally understood what you meant.  Thanks for the salad recipe!  :) #BooChou
This week we will eat bok choy!!  A first  for this family.  Thanks @foodboxproject!  :)
This apple pie is GIANT!  #thanksgiving 
@SDesserud @RSueClifford @FPVmuseum 
@SDesserud @RSueClifford We had Thanksgiving dinner @FPVmuseum a few years ago - it was good &amp; then we enjoyed a tour through the village!
Can't move.  So full. #turkeytime
Dad! We are stuck in the woods! Come help! Nicole's sweater is the worst! @serser498 
@late2game Probably in the bajillions!!
I wrote a vision instead of values. Does that count? #30days2vote 
Phew.  Found my knitting under a pile of coats.  Carry on.
Seriously. Where did I put my knitting?
Scored a fresh turkey at @WFFarmerMkt!
Hiking through Trans Canada Trail near Sunderland 
Rest assured @ShawnaLewk, we will not be going out on the water today! 
Cottage-on-the-lake soundtrack includes Travis' Indefinitely 'cause I really just want to stay here. 
@London_Colleen I made this roasted squash soup yesterday, and it is simple and delicious.  :)
@ChildreachAnne I shared it with Josh, and he said, "Meh."  He's not a tea connoisseur like us.
@ChildreachAnne @jane1231cat I found a zen tea bag in my suitcase, and the day was saved.
@ChildreachAnne @jane1231cat @KarGair  - wish you were here!  I found our office retreat!  Let's plan this. 
I'm in my happy place, but just realized what would make it happier - the white organic tea at my desk!  @ChildreachAnne @jane1231cat
@wildflowerwool I need to do the same!  Unless you just want to do that double, and I can just sit here and knit.  :)
@London_Colleen Agreed!  You guys were born to wear tweed, and you rock the tweed.  Next year!
@late2game It was my pleasure!  As an added bonus, I got to clock 6 hours for the @inmotion4Life challenge.  And my legs are feeling it!  :)
@London_Colleen @ShawnaLewk It was spectacular! I only broke one beer bottle on the dance floor &amp; I got a big hug from @MayorofLdnOnt!  :)
@ShawnaLewk I volunteered to volunteer.  :)
@ShawnaLewk I couldn't tweet because I was running tables all night, but the plus side of that was no hangover this morning.  :)
@MrsOceanstream @LaNoisetteBaker @London_Colleen @jesse_helmer  I could get used to Saturday mornings like that! :)
@MrsOceanstream YES!!  :)  It's most definitely 100% my favourite holiday!  I love me some turkey!
1 in 5 children in #ldnont live in poverty. Healthy eating is a challenge for families living on OW. 
@jesse_helmer @LaNoisetteBaker @London_Colleen Phew!
@jesse_helmer @LaNoisetteBaker @London_Colleen That actually crossed my mind when I tweeted it.  Do you knit like you dodge balls?
@jesse_helmer You better hope people show up @LaNoisetteBaker Sat a.m. or else @London_Colleen &amp; I are going to teach you how to knit! :)
For Throwback Thursday, I found a blog post from 3 years ago today - 
I'm joining @jesse_helmer for a coffee chat this Saturday from at @LaNoisetteBaker. Starts at 9am. #ldnvotes #ward4 
@MLHealthUnit I meant Leacy!  :)
Kim Leach from @MLHealthUnit asking the ward 11 candidates what 3 actions they would support to alleviate poverty.  #ldnvotes
@ShawnaLewk I see the back of your head!
Claire just gave @st3v3turn3r bunny ears and I missed getting a picture!  @KarGair - control your kid! :)
At Ward 11 debate at Landon- it's packed and warm.
Just got a lovely thank-you letter from @tanneramma for my donation. Now Ward 13ers - vote for this awesome person!  
I bonded with my dentist this morning when Phil Collins came on over the radio. Apparently both of our dads are big fans.
Hey @ldnBrian &amp; @bungibson - @aimee_brewer wants to convince her husband to foster bunnies.  Any advice to get him on board?
Happy birthday to my beautiful and super talented cousin @andrearoth888!  Here's wishing you a day as wonderful as you are!
@SDesserud I'm always surprised what a hot topic this is.  For me it's a no-brainer - poverty reflects poorly on us. Let's do better! :)
Not surprised at @st3v3turn3r's thoughtful &amp; knowledgeable responses to the @MLHealthUnit's poverty survey - 
Disappointed by the lack of responses by campaigning city councillors to the poverty survey. Results here - 
Day 2 - I'm loving the #30Days2Vote challenge, @London_Colleen! I don't even need to look this one up!  I'm in Ward 11. :)
I've been struggling with describing my role as an Ally, but this video nails it. 
It's Saturday night, and I'm queuing up some @ThisAmerLife to go with a cup of sleepytime tea.
@RSueClifford @London_Colleen Ah!  I don't think so. I'm hanging out with my littlest -  I feel like I never see her!
@RSueClifford @London_Colleen Am I going to Monday's W&amp;P 30-day challenge launch?  If that's the question, the answer is maybe? :)
#BridgesOutOfPoverty should be a part of school curriculum.  Build awareness and understanding for the future.
The paradigm shift needs to start at the Leader.  Don't give up.  Understand poverty concepts.
Welfare to Career's success built Cascade's reputation in the community AND nationally.  #BridgesOutOfPoverty
Employers of Choice are going to have low turnover &amp; they are going to get the BEST people.  Plus customer satisfaction &amp; profitability!
Hiring unemployed &amp; underemployed benefits business because they're building a loyal  customer base. Win-win!
As Keeper of the Culture,  he ensures that everyone is treated with dignity and respect.  #BridgesOutOfPoverty
Dave Barrett now speaking.  As Director of Talent Management of Cascades Engineering,  he is also known as the Keeper of Culture.
Eagerly awaiting Dave Barrett's presentation on Social Good is Just Good Business! #BridgesOutOfPoverty
@London_Colleen Good reminder, my friend.
@London_Colleen You need to add debate facilitator to your resume!  I'm watching on livestream, and you are brilliant!  :)
@London_Colleen It was really neat!  We had never met before, so it took a while for us to make the connection. :)
At my Circles dinner, I found myself sitting next to my littlest's school principal.  I love how volunteering connects us! @EndPovertyLDN
@ArjunGupta I'm well.  Next time we need to coordinate our timing better.  I want to hear all about the fantastic things you're up to!
@RSueClifford I was rooting for @CanadianCheri from my couch!  Hurray!
@st3v3turn3r  Who doesn't love a pop tart cat flying through the air spraying out rainbows?!?!  
The Bee's Nyan Cat illustration for @st3v3turn3r's #31DaysToEDay art auction! 
@ArjunGupta Are you at the debate?  I left half an hour ago.  I missed you!!
@MGirash @PaulChengLdn As a #nonprofit employee,  I am offended. As someone who has lived below the poverty line, I am offended.
At the @PillarNN mayoral candidate debate &amp; @Matt_Brown_ is mentioning his work on the @Childreach board &amp; the issues faced by nonprofits.
@ChildreachAnne Oh dear! That IS early! I vaguely remember you telling me all of this, but blocked it out so it wouldn't be real. Miss you!
@ChildreachAnne Back at ya, my friend!  Even on vacation, you are up earlier than me!  :)
I meant @literacyFTW !
@PDibby81 You're going to want to follow @KarGair @thisisliteracy @jane1231cat and @ChildreachAnne too!  #ldnont
@PDibby81 This means you're going to turn out alright.  :)  Also let's make yoga breaks a regular thing on Friday afternoons.
Hurray, @PDibby81!  I'd like to think I had some influence on you joining the twitters AND your PDibby handle.  :)
@London_Colleen @MuseumLondon  I just realized today was Friday. So this would have been helpful yesterday. But now I'm excited it's Friday!
@London_Colleen Check out the current exhibits @MuseumLondon!  They're open until 9pm Thursday nights.  :)  #ldnont #staycation #free
@London_Colleen That's right!  You're on the @TVTA_London_Ont trail!  :)  Happy #staycation &amp; anniversary!
@MrsOceanstream @Childreach Woo hoo!! :)
@foodboxproject I always love beets and carrots!  Squash and yams are sweet too!  I've also been loving the oranges in your boxes. :)
The teen called home today &amp; the tween answered.
Teen: Hey, Bee! Whatchya doin'?
Tween (deadpan): Life. (and hangs up)
I love these two.
@AbeOudshoorn Thank you for welcoming my scholar!  :)  She was glad to see a familiar face.  @westernu
This washing dishes by hand isn't half as bad as I thought it would be. I'd almost say it was enjoyable.
@JennaGoodhand I would think that @lifespinorg's  Free Store could make use of it - 
Just made a donation to Stephen Turner for Council 
Don't worry, @rouquinne!  You're in good company - I've donated 2 photographs &amp; I'm just an amateur! :)   @st3v3turn3r @CanadianCheri
I'm collecting pieces for @st3v3turn3r's art fundraiser. I'm excited to see what @CanadianCheri &amp; @rouquinne are donating!
Me: Let's watch Sky in the Castle.
E: SKY in the CASTLE?!?
B: Mum speaks Yoda.
#FamilyMovieNight #CastleInTheSky
@ChildreachAnne If I could, I would favourite this a bajillion times. :)  Yes.
It's Saturday night, and I'm dishwasher shopping.  I call it dishwashopping. I just want something that boils silverware clean. #fancy
The tweens were discussing the best things to wear to a party, and I chimed in with "a Luigi hat."  Thanks, @dbillson.
FYI @kledgley I am trying out a new deodorant today. Consider yourself warned.  Right now it smells good.  Shrugs. #LunchDate
Last night I was making deodorant with @kezzaloudoun, and tonight I found myself in the same room as @JustinTrudeau.  So there's that.
@C0mmunityG33k Polka-dotted puffy sleeves no less!
Will be spending the next hour putting away my @foodboxproject box away and meal planning.  There's so much!
@mk0986 We're not much for rides, but I could see how you'd be disappointed if you had an unlimited ride pass.
@mk0986 @CTVLondon @WesternFair We were there REALLY early - this pic was taken before 4pm today. When we left at 7pm, it was pretty busy.
On the ferris wheel with the Bee at the @WesternFair! #ldnont 
Just called in my first noise complaint.  Officially feel old.
Westminster Park and it's National Beer Appreciation Day at the APK. 
Westminster Park at the APK right now! #ldnont 
And he brought his speaker.  I wonder if he still listens to the Steve Miller Band. We may soon find out.
My 84-year old grandpa asked my teen if she was "in the cloud."  She shook her head.  He is the only cool cat with an ipad at the party.
For me, being "engaged" means caring about issues in the community and being the change I want to see. #socialgood
Can I go back 20 years to #Roseanne's front door and high-five her for this? (via @Upworthy) 
@ShawnaLewk They're going to go perfectly with our gigantic tubs of ice cream from the @LdnIceCreamCo!
@ShawnaLewk I peeked in the oven to see 12 overflowing cupcakes to which I noted that the recipe made 24. Beah will love her giant cupcakes!
While I was fixing my issue with the car, Josh was baking cupcakes.
I troubleshooted my car today using the owner's manual.  #LikeABoss
@MrsOceanstream Come visit me @Childreach. I'll be toiling away at my desk on the 2nd floor, so if you pop by, ask someone to call me down!
Thank you, @London_Colleen!  From one engaged woman in #ldnont to another.
I needed this today. Thank you, @ShawnaLewk. My secret to superstardom is surrounding myself with brilliant caring individuals. Nudge, wink.
@bookcheckgirl Yis, Guv'nor.
@bookcheckgirl I was telling my co-workers about a Vanity Fair article I read over the summer &amp; unconsciously added a British accent. #curse
@bookcheckgirl UPDATE: I have now finished 2 seasons of Luther. Can't sleep.  Must keep watching.
Anything to help spread the #MooseLove @purple_moose!  Here's our #MooseSock @prideldnfest! 
@purple_moose I have more than one.  Just saying.  #MooseSock 
@shawnwlewis @nancm @st3v3turn3r My best guess is that Armstrong was thinking about all of the elevators that have been lost and forgotten.
@ShawnaLewk I knew what you meant.  :)
@ShawnaLewk @MayorofLdnOnt There was a standing ovation in my living room.  Does that count?
@London_Colleen I clearly remember thinking I was SO OLD when she started kindergarten. Last night she got home after midnight. I'm ancient.
@Joy_Birch @London_Colleen It's unreal,right?  :)  I'm only getting one kid ready for school this morning.
@bookcheckgirl I have not. Adding it to the queue.  If we keep recommending back &amp; forth, we'll never leave the couch. Add some knitting.
@bookcheckgirl The Inbetweeners is SO juvenile, but hilarious - you probably need a laugh after Happy Valley.
@bookcheckgirl I can't even imagine where they would go in a second season!  Have you ever watched The Inbetweeners?
@bookcheckgirl I couldn't sleep last night until I watched the last three episodes. So  relieved it's over.
Why buy a cottage on a lake when you can buy an annual @OntarioParks day use pass for $150? Enjoy the beach then sleep in your own bed. :)
@lisamay17 Too bad! We were at the Pinery.
at the beach soaking up what's left of the summer 
Packed the cooler, towels and bathing suits! Beach, here we come. 
@bookcheckgirl I've added it to my queue.  On an unrelated note, are you done unpacking????
@Mike_Donachie @themetrolondon my summer in 1 photo = swimming towels + flip flops + books + knitting project + dock 
@florabelle444 $15 and no tax!
@florabelle444 @Canucklehead_ca @chrisloblaw It's still there!  I waffled and ended up leaving it.
@chrisloblaw @Canucklehead_ca That's a GREAT idea!  I was just thinking it would jazz up the teen's bedroom.  It's only $15!
Look what we found at the Restore!  #ldnont #mustache Should I go back and get it???? Ack. 
Westminster Ponds for an afternoon hike 
oh, how they grow . . . like beanstalks . . . sweet beautiful beanstalks . . . #sisters #tbt 
@kellyaireche we're just waiting for movie #2! Thanks for hosting an awesome SURPRISE party! :)
Half an hour ago, we picked up our first order with the @foodboxproject, &amp; I've already eaten a plum, a carrot &amp; an orange. Yum!
@CraigbGilbert Lots of them! This calls for a batch of homemade hummus!
#ldnont #foodboxproject 
@London_Colleen Are you referring to my toddler angst?  :)
@rouquinne That's funny!  Let's not forget the giant pointy collars and cabled vests!
That plaid.
I declare today #ThrowBackSunday because I just found this 70's gem of me + my mum + dad! 
@London_Colleen Oh no!!!  :(
Today's awesome included @purple_moose tights, @fireroastedcafe half-sweet vanilla latte + @AllBoutCheese1 maple smoked cheddar! #ldnont
In my short bike ride home from yoga, I bumped into my fave neighbour @kellyaireche AND got invited to a block party this weekend! Woot!
It's been a year since my dad's successful heart surgery - the best gift my family has been given thanks to the cardiac unit @LHSCCanada.
@gillianmandich This sounds awesome!  I wish I could be there, my friend, but we've got tickets to the drive-in for that night only. :(
I really hope that my colleagues' biggest complaint about me is that I sing instead of talking (and moon-walk out of meetings). My bad.
One of my favouritest performances  at @AeolianHall  was the correction line ensemble a few years ago.  
I'm seaming up a blanket to donate to @Mission1951 while waiting for my muffins to bake &amp; listening to my girls laugh. #gratitude
@AbeOudshoorn @gabriellafranny @westernu That's awesome!  She's already marked her calendar!  :)
So @gabriellafranny got accepted into @westernu's Scholars program!  So excited for her! I can't stop talking in exclamation marks!!
2nd last soccer game of the summer done. #win 
@andrearoth888 Around here, we call it 'dirt blindness'.  It afflicts most males.  :)
@andrearoth888 It looks pretty!!
@AustenGilliland You can do it in time for Rhinebeck!  You'll breeze through all that stockinette. Just think of all the knitter envy!
@AustenGilliland Your sweater is going to be beautiful!
Good things. Warrior pose + cinnamon-raisin toast + a little strange talk before bed. 
Went hiking in Medway Valley Heritage Forest.  I had almost forgotten it was there.  We're lucky to have so many great trails in #ldnont.
Missed visiting the @purple_moose today!  I want to see the bacon socks, the kitten socks, the x-ray socks, the ice cream socks . . .
Enjoyed the afternoon @MantisFestival &amp; @BeahLearn sold a few pieces of art &amp; was photo-bombed by the @DHMakerBus! :) 
@RSueClifford @W_minster_Park @TothSusan I'll see you the @MantisFestival!  We're heading over soon to be there for noon.
@ChildreachAnne Thanks!  I was such a nervous nelly!  Happy Anniversary!  Make sure you celebrate with some HR policy review! :)
Success achieved at soccer.  Haven't played in three weeks &amp; didn't embarass myself.  Only kicked air twice. :)
The optometrist confirmed that I'm far-sighted &amp; a lightbulb went on. This is why I have personal space issues. Stay away. I can't see you.
Dear @London_Colleen, how are you not shouting about this awesome write-up &amp; clip from the rooftops,my friend??? 
The Bee will be displaying her awesome manga art @MantisFestival Saturday 12-2pm! #ldnont 
@st3v3turn3r  Heck yes, but for real.. This was no Seaworld.
Went to our first boat party today, and we were the only ones wearing nautical pashminas and flippy-floppies.
@OnedayDesigns I like you how you think, Linda!!  :)
Just made my first batch of no-cook freezer jam. I feel as if I'm on top of the world. Could be the sugar. AND we have no bread.
Winding down after a week in the office with the Zolas . .  . 
@KarGair Thanks for the heads up!  I can bring blueberries, grapes and clementines. There's some old watermelon in the fridge at work.
I've enjoyed playing lots of soccer games in the rain, but I'm less enthusiastic about doing yoga in a downpour. Managed 45 mins &amp; gave up.
Phew! It's at least a little bit tidier.  I am afraid to look in the closet. :( 
@lamealias  Her floor is tidier ONLY because all of the stuff on it was thrown on the bed, the chair and the desk. 
The littlest is cleaning her room, and by that, I mean she is sitting on her floor and drawing pictures surrounded by mess.
We're at the Pride parade! #ldnont 
Last night in Maine - trying to eat up all the food in the fridge. So full. I give up.
Got my knitting and cup of coffee next to me . . . life is good. 
If I'm starving and driving simultaneously, there will be lots of fighting over who will peel the orange because no one likes sticky hands.
.@gabriellafranny just gave me the heads up that one of my shirt's buttons was undone. Then she sang, "Scaaaanduloussss!"
@kledgley TWINS!  :)
@jodisimpson  I was laughing so much, there were tears. I was afraid the kids would come in the room &amp; think something was wrong! :)
I really should go to bed, but I can NOT stop watching the first 5 seconds of this video and laughing. 
@kellyaireche Beah LOVED camp!  But she was also over-the-moon to be reunited with us at the end of the week.  :)  So happy you are back!
This is so cool looking up my old blog posts - here's what I wrote SIX years ago today.  
4 years ago today I had 5 pounds of blueberries.  I really should check the bottom of the freezer &amp; post an update. 
@379_Deanne  Agreed.  I watched Tracks last night . . . and the shorts.  That's all.
biking to yoga in the park at 6:45am wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it might be 
@ChildreachAnne You are awesome!  Tea time!  We have lots of milk - 2L!  It would have been a dream come true for @KarGair!
Hey @ChildreachAnne!  Did you make it to the @WFFarmerMkt on Saturday to get us the world's best molasses cookies? I didn't.  Sad face.
The chemistry experiments continue after unpacking the Bee's school knapsack &amp; finding a 3-week old lunch.  Gag.
@LameAlias  Sigh. You're probably right. He doesn't really look like he's on 'high alert'.
@LameAlias I'm 80% sure that the giant marshmallow man will wake up from his little rest on the roof &amp; protect the house.
It's no chemistry experiment or the molecular model that we could have built, but it's just as awesome. @LameAlias 
Squeezing in a quick coffee before I dive into some @DIY chemistry experiments with a gaggle of tweens. #mintpants
.@jane1231cat! RT @rtraction: @GoodahTruck is returning to rtraction on Monday (11a-2p). Join us at 358 Horton St E for some awesome eats!
@paisley_girl73 Will do!  I am positive that I can find the rest of the series in one of the girls' rooms.  :)
Always lovely to catch up with @paisley_girl73!  I'm in awe of everything she does &amp; eats - now I'm hankering for @EdgarAndJoes oat cakes.
I used to breeze thru eyebrow waxes, but now it's torture. PS Now I know the rule RE: "used to" vs "use to". 
Proof that I've been knitting - 3 pairs of stripe-y socks since June. #SandalWeather 
I just made a batch of these coconut peanut butter balls, and they go well with a cup of coffee. Just saying. 
@adeburger Thanks,  Angela!
@London_Colleen Oh no!  Hugs.
Absolutely! @kezzaloudoun - let's check our calendars &amp; get one booked!  Or a Sunday - the 13th?
Spotted the @TVTA_London_Ont ramblers hiking across Springbank this morning on my way to work. I held back the urge to loudly cheer &amp; honk.
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts is offering FREE programs the same day we're visiting!  
@YGAP_ldn  @AlyssaMGilbert I'm adding it all to my list!  Thanks!  I love me a good market.
@AwesomeBioTA I think there's a Paul Revere house in Salem which is where we're staying!
@AlyssaMGilbert  And soak up the smartness?  Imagine the pictures!
@rouquinne I like the way you think!  :)
@AwesomeBioTA That made me laugh out loud.  :)
We're spending a day in Boston on foot - what do we HAVE to see/do/eat? Without breaking the bank.
Hey @London_Colleen! I found our Saturday a.m. market friend Len (&amp; Ella)!  
@KarGair @Childreach @Goodwill_OGL  I LOVE it!  think I can dig up 1 or 14 stripey shirts &amp; sailor-y pants for tomorrow!  I'm in!
Celebrated my friend becoming a grandmother today with creme brulee + lattes at the Springs.  Life is good.
Excellent article about my friend @AlyssaMGilbert's postnatal stroke &amp; recovery. 
Strawberry picking @millarberry - check. 
@purple_moose YES!  We just need some shears, wool carders &amp; a spinning wheel!  Richard Marx socks coming right up!
@purple_moose I had none of her albums. I was too busy that summer weeping to Richard Marx - 
I was 100% positive that my camp counsellor was Debbie Gibson. The more she denied it, the more I was convinced. 
@beachpsalms That's funny!  Mine has been watching 'packing' videos on youtube for a month!  :)
I googled the owner of the cottage we're renting in Maine &amp; she is the ED of her town's equivalent of @MySistersPlace. I love her already.
The littlest is ready for camp tomorrow. Sewed buttons on her shorts, washed her flippy-floppys &amp; packed her manga books. Next up: cuddles.
I'm pretty sure that this is the first time these two were in cahoots. Nothing's changed. #throwbackthursday 
I wrote today's post on the @childreach #parentconnect blog!  
@PeopleofLdnOnt I just found this awesome twitter account that might help you - @LdnOntFacts!
@PeopleofLdnOnt Do it! :)
@PeopleofLdnOnt You have to bring him in to see me @Childreach!!  I miss both of you!
I think we BOTH have awesome kids!  :)  Beah had the BEST time!  Thank you!!  @kellyaireche
@kellyaireche Beah is still wearing the mustache ring!  :)
@RSueClifford I know, right?  Baskets are a lovely thing. Functional, simple,made of natural materials . . . why not make it our wall art?
B: What's that?
Me: A basket to hang on the wall.
B: That doesn't make sense.
Me: I know.  That's why I'm hanging it on the wall. 
#dontask
@PeopleofLdnOnt Do the best you can until you know better.  Then when you know better, do better.  ALSO: Do the best with what you have.
It was my pleasure, @London_Colleen!  You were brilliant as always!  And that guy @Wine_Vinyl too.  :)
You know you're old when you get home from the bar, you finish up the laundry &amp; you're still in bed before the kids. #SaturdayNight
At the Regis to bask in the glory of Westminster Park - it's a packed house! 
I feel like my dad's record collection is hanging on the wall at the Regis. #hueylewis #thepolice #SaturdayNightFever cc/ @serser498
Hey @jesse_helmer  &amp; @Adinagator - I can see you  @W_minster_Park!
Kudos to the @ImpactJunk team -  they hauled away all the crap in our backyard last week  &amp; I'll be forever in their debt.  :) #LdnOnt
@ChildreachAnne @KarGair @jane1231cat It feels like we are living &amp; breathing this 
Hey, @AbeOudshoorn!  Here's that documentary I was talking about - 
@Nick_McRae_ I see what you mean. :)   And agree!
@Nick_McRae_ Why not? Private enterprise needs a healthy middle-class for strong economy - education is key to good incomes. It's a win-win.
@PeopleofLdnOnt If you're ever interested in being an Ally (esp. now that you've had the training) &amp; you've any questions, feel free to ask!
@PeopleofLdnOnt I am a Circles Ally which really amounts to increasing someone's social capital by being a friend. :)  #bridgesoutofpoverty
@London_Colleen @Wine_Vinyl I love it!  There's some good forgery going on here.
That was excellent. #nuitblancheldn 
Ideal instagram spot #nuitblancheldn 
nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche nuit blanche #LdnOnt
Really appreciated the FREE bike valet parking the Dundas Street Festival @ourstreetlondon @CycleLdnont #LdnOnt 
Just walked into @purple_moose and yelled out "I need a pair of drunk &amp; disorderly!" I clarified, "Not for me." too late.   @London_Colleen
@London_Colleen @purple_moose I can pick them up for you!
Hey @London_Colleen - want me to pick you up some rainbow @purple_moose socks for the 
Got our 
I can't even compete!  Your fist bump takes the cake, @ChildreachAnne!  #bosslady
I played some solid defense in the 2nd half of tonight's soccer game. Yesterday's double yoga must have given me an edge. I'm in awe of me.
@AwesomeBioTA Yay!  Municipal election time!  It's time to switch out the lawn sign!  @gabriellafranny
THANKS @AwesomeBioTA for your advice!  It worked!  @gabriellafranny successfully registered &amp; voted at our polling station. :) No issues!
@London_Colleen I just voted, but @gabriellafranny is working until 8pm, so she'll vote on her way home.  :)
Ella is rockin' the diploma! 
@ShawnaLewk @London_Colleen We guarantee fun on top of fun.
@ShawnaLewk ME!!!!  The girls love it , so they're coming along AND @London_Colleen too!
@AwesomeBioTA Thanks! :)
@ShawnaLewk There was no deadline on the website. I did find it strange that there was no office or electronic form available. Only mail!
@London_Colleen We'll try.  Not ready to give up on this yet.  :)
@large_coffee  We're going to try that.  Wish us luck!
So I mailed El's voter registration form early May &amp; they emailed her on June 3 to say that there's not enough time to register her. Really?
@AustenGilliland I'm sure there's a method to get rid of them before bringing them inside, but I'm too lazy. I blew &amp; shook it a bit. Shrug.
Peonies from my front yard - now on the mantle.  Pretty, but I think I may have just invited an army of ants inside. 
.@st3v3turn3r The @cqe councillors were still talking about Molly this weekend!  I think they fell in love with her.
.@st3v3turn3r @cqe  You are absolutely right!
.@RSueClifford @cqe It was magical.  I'm so very happy that I woke up super early to catch it.
sunrise @cqe at 5:30 Saturday morning with a cup of tea in one hand &amp; my camera in the other 
@KarGair @Childreach There was a plate of melon slices awaiting us @cqe!  And I had packed a banana &amp; grapes! #FruitFiday
@devilishone We're lucky to be neighbours with a herd of deer too!  It's pretty sweet living along the Thames. :)
@devilishone What an amazing way to start your day! :)  Happy Friday, Will!
@ChildreachAnne @KarGair  And five different flavours of expired hummus.  :)
@ChildreachAnne @KarGair I'm going to dig out my winter jacket. Plug the Keurig machine in!  I'll be there within the hour! :)  MUFFINS!
.@KarGair Today's a bit chilly.  You should wear some cords.
.@MrsOceanstream You're awesome!
@ShawnaLewk Strike that.  Ainsley is a teacher too.  Meredith sounds just like Ainsley!
@ShawnaLewk Can you hear the kids now?  Beah was giving Ainsley homework on monsters.  And Meredith wants Beah to kill the spiders.  :)
@ShawnaLewk We made it out to Sanatorium Road and back.  At a very leisurely pace. :)
@late2game @ShawnaLewk We saw the Wednesday Night Bike Ride gang cycle by us, but we were too busy chatting to join them. :) Next week!
First bike ride of the year! @ShawnaLewk - pencil in Wednesday Night Bike Ride next week! :) #LdnOnt 
.@jane1231cat I think I captured our #AnnualDayofFun perfectly here - 
.@London_Colleen @purple_moose I want the socks with the girl confiding to the pony that she hates everyone too. #SocksForIntroverts
Now that my vegetable broth is cooling down in jars, I can call it a night. #HandmadeLife
.@London_Colleen There should be a way to triple favourite tweets.
@kledgley Sad face! I will see you at this week's ending poverty mtg &amp; we can catch up!
@kledgley Are you in the Museum?  I am on the first floor!  :)
@chrismcinnis At a farm just outside of Granton. The piglets were roaming around the barn &amp; thru the fields without a care. It was so cute!
The piglets might have been my favourite part of tonight's book club meeting. Flashbacks of Wilbur &amp; Charlotte's Web. 
Made a new friend today. #BookClub #DreamFarm 
@ChildreachAnne I just took it all in while she played w/20 piglets, jumped hay bails, ate 'smores, picked letttuce &amp; ate that too, :)
On the farm for tonight's mother-daughter book club - talking about A Wrinkle in Time around the campfire 
@ElectroSideshow Good to know! I would have been writing up troupes &amp; installations for not sticking to old-school-circus-high-tech-wonders!
Nuit Blanche is my most favourite, favouritest night of the year in #LdnOnt! This year's theme is @ElectroSideshow  
Thanks @Ange_Hawkins!  That is so sweet of you to say. :)  It made my day.  Happy Thursday!
@London_Colleen You have this!  You can help @MrsOceanstream run after the babe!
I spy @London_Colleen &amp; @MrsOceanstream! Only 3 weeks to this year's run, ladies! 
@ShawnaLewk  I agree!  Thanks!  :)
@London_Colleen Aw, thanks! I just have a lot of social capital &amp; it is my privilege to give some of that to someone who really needs it.
@chrismcinnis It reminds me of @AbeOudshoorn's first talk at @igniteldn - 
@ardenmcclean You would be perfect! You are amazing at connecting w/people &amp; developing relationships. You just need more hours in a day. :)
Next week I will take my title of 'friend' to a new level as a Circles Ally.  I'm nervous &amp; excited.  
Yoyos are where it's at. 
Picnicking under the trees in the town square of the Pioneer Village #ldnont 
The Bee &amp; I are going to find a quiet canopy of trees to picnic under. We have some ideas, but anybody have fave spots?  #LdnOnt
Picking up the ol' kendama while I wait for the cookies to finish baking.  This ain't yer mama's cup &amp;… 
When anyone asks "Seriously?" around here,  we answer "Seriously black." and then we all have a laugh. Because it's funny.
@London_Colleen I did!  It was exactly what I was looking for. Phew.  Now to get rid of my old bike.  It needs a bit of lovin' + fixin'.
@London_Colleen I picked you up a bicycle bell.  Consider it a bike-warming gift. I expect you to make music with it. #NextAlbum
@elanknits Oh dear!  That's not fun!  We managed to get a big table and fill it up - there was lots of baby cuddling and knitting!
It's raining babbys here. #knittersandfritters and little critters.
@London_Colleen with baby Emmett cc @officeprincess #knittersandfritters 
@aimee_brewer Woo-hoo!!!
@ShawnaLewk I debated crawling over people to sit with you, but @tannerama had cough candies in case my throat caught on fire.  :)
@elanknits Well you know where we'll be! :)
Today I'm wearing lots of layers of blue &amp; green. You know what they say - blue &amp; green should never be seen. #yolo
@zalpacas The Bee &amp; I will have drop by the farm and say hello to the alpacas soon!  And to you too, of course! :)
@wildflowerwool Too bad!  Say hi to Joan for me.  Did I read that you're running?  In our 'hood?  Can I join you sometime?
@zalpacas And yes to the @WFFarmerMkt - we're aiming for 9 a.m.  :)
@zalpacas So far there's about 5 or 6 of us!  :)
I can b an engine buzzing like a bee-I’m a real independent doing the laundry &amp; planning 4 the future-it’s the nature of a renaissance girl.
@orangeheromama Boo!  Maybe we should schedule a run or a game of really bad tennis so that we can catch up on life properly.  :)
How did I forget you, my friend??  @orangeheromama Are you in for #knittersandfritters this Saturday?
@AlyssaMGilbert Have fun and take pictures!  There's nothing cuter than tiny cleats and tiny shin pads.
@London_Colleen @gabriellafranny Yes!
Great idea!  We should plan a celebratory graduation dinner for the 4 of us!  @London_Colleen @gabriellafranny
I was going to go to bed anyways.  So there.  @gabriellafranny
@gabriellafranny don't be jealous that I've been chatting online all day. Besides, we both know that I'm training to be a cage fighter.
@kataish It's really informal and on the fly. Too bad about this Saturday - we'll have to catch up another time! :)
@SDesserud 9 a.m.-ish?
@officeprincess   I'm picking up @London_Colleen at 8:30am, so you might beat us there. But not by much! :)
I haven't forgotten about @zalpacas &amp; @wildflowerwool &amp; @RGwriting &amp; @kataish &amp; @devilishone #knittersandfritters this Saturday?
@BrianGibson13 @bungibson I figured as much!  Just didn't want to leave you out. :)
@PBarmby We'll be @fireroastedcafe 2nd floor of @WFFarmerMkt by 9am. Look for a gaggle of sticks &amp; strings. Depends how long. Maybe 11?
@MandyPenney Good idea!  MY gang is good. Life is busy.  Same old, same old.
@MandyPenney  Too bad.  It's been ages since I've seen you!   Hope you're well. :)
Who's in for #knittersandfritters on Saturday? @SDesserud @AwesomeBioTA @elanknits @BrianGibson13 @bungibson @AlyssaMGilbert anyone else?
Roll call for #knittersandfritters on Saturday a.m. @knitty_kat @officeprincess @MandyPenney @slowlygoing @PoeProdigy @aimee_brewer 1/2
@bookcheckgirl Yesterday I took El to get her prom dress fitted, and her beauty took my breath away. She could have worn a paper bag.
@bookcheckgirl 11 years have just flown by!  I miss those baby faces.
They're not so little anymore, but they're still lovely and almost ALWAYS in cahoots. #tbt #sisters 
It's in the calendar! RT @London_Colleen "@W_minster_Park and Broom Sticks &amp; Hammers are playing @StRegistavern on June 21."
I love this weekend tribute written by @London_Colleen!  It's just her karma bank paying her back tenfold. 
@London_Colleen It's unrecognizable!!  I had to think where this was in your yard, but then I saw the steps!
The tween just reminded me that the first rule about fight club is to never talk about fight club. Okay.
Aw, I think we'll keep you, @gabriellafranny.  You're good at crushing spiders &amp; photoshop &amp; making puns &amp; eating food &amp; stuff like that.
@LameAlias @RSueClifford @W_minster_Park I was dangerously close to getting a parking ticket!  No teenage dark lord. :)
@taaylorholden I think you're safe.  @gabriellafranny has gone missing on twitter. She's all studying &amp; working &amp; no play.  :(
@bookcheckgirl  I'd suggest a shopping trip, but the kid has clothes FLOWING out of her closet.  Literally.
@kledgley I have inherited her frugality.  However, I make exceptions for fine cheeses, luxury balls of wool and the odd olive.  :)
Note to Mum: Time to buy new birthday candles.  They're starting to melt into cakes. THAT was close. 
@PBarmby What's up with THAT? :)
I've NEVER met a baby Nadine. I don't believe they even exist.
It was between this cat hug card &amp; a ninja card.  The cat won because he has ninja moves. 
Oh dear! The tween is pulling out last yr's summer dresses &amp; they all seem to be a foot shorter.  The maxis are now minis.
On the TVTA trail with @London_Colleen catching up! 
@wildflowerwool That's where I am too!  :)  One more to go!  Happy knitting!
The #AnnualDayofFun ended with an hour of fireworks &amp; a glass of wine in the neighbours' front yard. I'm so tired from all the laughing.
Toddler PRO on scooter #AnnualDayofFun :) 
Family in front of us at  Giant Tiger is buying lingerie and fireworks. They're having their own #AnnualDayofFun.
@PeopleofLdnOnt Agreed!  What good is a reserved table without a reserved parking space???  :)
@PeopleofLdnOnt @RSueClifford @London_Colleen @rouquinne @BRJJharvey That was awesome bumping into you ladies @Heemans !  Nice haul!
#AnnualDayofFun took a turn. Latino Market is closed today! WHA? :(
Next stop on the #AnnualDayofFun is the Latino Market for 13 million 30 one hundred and 8 empanadas!
Picking Flowers @Heemans #AnnualDayofFun 
Maycourt Club Bake Sale @Heemans #AnnualDayofFun 
It's not often we agree, but we need to take a right out of Trails End to get to @Heemans #AnnualDayofFun
Found the perfect shirt for Jane #AnnualDayofFun 
Stocked up with a year's worth of FREE ouzo candies after breakfast.  #AnnualDayofFun
Breakfast! #AnnualDayofFun 
Who knew you could reserve tables for breakfast at Trissa's??  Not us. #AnnualDayofFun
Jane says  
Have you seen my wig around?
I feel naked without it.
#AnnualDayofFun
Will Jane buy a hippy sundress that smells like meat? #AnnualDayofFun
Jane &amp; Nadine's #AnnualDayofFun is about to get started!!  (There used to be two but was deemed too much.)
Friday night playlists &amp; knitting always ends up with me wishing I was in a brass band. 
Years from now when @gabriellafranny moves out &amp; gets a pug, I will knit her one of these sweaters - 
Thanks again to everyone w…
@PeopleofLdnOnt I'll be potting red geraniums + white bacopa. I've not had luck w/veggies- my shady yard isn't conducive to growing food. :(
@mrjoshmorgan @BGCLondon has summer camp for ages 5 and up.  You could inquire about 4 year olds?  Also check @children_museum ?
@serser498 It's exactly what you needed - the can of OFF that you bought yourself.  But seriously I haven't bought you anything yet. #NoCar
Hey, dad! Whatever you do, DON'T go into the woods! I have your bug spray! Will return on Monday in the form of your b-day gift. @serser498
Hey @ShawnaLewk !  Have you heard about @GenNextUW book club with an impact?  
I'm going to miss @ChipatLFPress on The Political Beat with @PatatLFPress .  :(  #ldnont
@PeopleofLdnOnt I love breakfast best too!  My go-to's are  @EdgarAndJoes &amp; @sohodinerlondon &amp; Trissa's by Trails End Market. :)
In true Nadine-style, I completely negated tonight's zumba class by serving up a big bowl of moose tracks ice cream over brownies.
@London_Colleen @gabriellafranny It's from last year's Mother's Day hike in Dundas Valley - followed by Swedish meatballs at IKEA.  :)
@gabriellafranny @BeahLearn This reminds me of the time you took a pic of her name scribbling in the car.  #ThrowBackTweet
Trilliums at Springwater Conservation Area #mamasday #hiking 
THANKS @gabriellafranny &amp; @BeahLearn for the @battysbath patchouli facial moisturizer for mum's day.  #ShopLocal  #TeenNoLikeSharing
@bookcheckgirl Thanks!  You too!  Remember to bring your camera, and pop by @HenrysCamera in Masonville for the Canon 50mm f1.8 lens. :)
@bookcheckgirl Using gluten-free lettuce! :)   Kidding aside - one is beans &amp; the other is quinoa.
@bookcheckgirl Have you packed your picnic for tomorrow yet?  I've prepared some gluten-free salads &amp; desserts for post-hiking. Next: rest.
@bookcheckgirl  Me too.  My legs are feeling tight today after all of the sprinting last night at soccer.  But it's a good hurt.  :)
Lovely morning @WFFarmerMkt - got my produce for the week &amp; a latte from @fireroastedcafe &amp; saw friends @RSueClifford &amp; @TheWoolBoutique
@lisamay17 I recall some Friday teams playing on Sundays as practice.  Those were the games when the scores were double digit to 0.
@lisamay17 You're crazy!  Friday nights with Kensal Park is competitive!!  And the players seem younger. Amirite?
@lisamay17 Oh dear! Are you playing Kensal Park or Sistas?
@KarGair  Do you mean SCORE-gishborg?
@ChildreachAnne I switched it up this time and played defence.  I just need to be really careful about not scoring on my on net.  :)
2-1. A good start to the summer soccer season!  #win

Hoping the rain stays away for the @LdnHomeless Soup &amp; Bread Lunch today @CoventMarket but I'm bringing my umbrella just in case. #LdnOnt
@bucketlistlaura I've been to Mont Saint Michel!  The tide was out, but I would have also loved to see it surrounded by water!
@RSueClifford Jeff Schlemmer from Neighbourhood Legal Services.  :)
@jesse_helmer Jeff has presented at our Housing Advisory meetings, and he's a strong voice for the most vulnerable.  #LdnOnt
I think tonight's yoga class would have been nicer outside in the park. Wouldn't you agree, @unshackld ?  :)
@SabsSoaps They must have been good because there are only six left!  :)
Overcooked the applesauce, so I baked some coconut macaroons to go with my tea. The oven timer works like a charm. 
@bookcheckgirl - here's the Frog Music playlist - 
The con to getting ready last is that the only belt in the house gets snatched up quick.  Pants, please stay up by yourself.
@SDesserud Why do we keep missing each other???  We need to plan these things better! This was my 3rd time hearing Emma.  She is very funny!
Sadly missed @FemPoliLDN but was taking in a reading @londonlibrary w/ Emma Donoghue followed by lattes @fireroastedcafe w/ @bookcheckgirl
Join me @CoventMarket Market Square on Friday at noon for @LdnHomeless Soup &amp; Bread Day!   
I got a sweet thank you card from the owner of the cottage we're renting in Maine this summer!  So unexpectedly thoughtful of her! #holiday

@bookcheckgirl MMmmm . . .  fingers! :)  See you soon!  Just having a bite to eat before we head out!  The sun needs to come back out.
@LameAlias I've seen a project like this before - it's quite lovely!  It would also be years before you had a scarf to enjoy. :)
@tanneramma It's always great seeing you!  Here's a close-up of our deer! 
There's no better feeling than filling up an empty tank of gas. #slightexaggeration Not very earth-friendly of me.
Luna cover! It's been years on top of years!
Westminster Park is on stage at the London Music Club #ldnont @London_Colleen 
At London Music Club to see Westminster Park - 2 minutes! 
@RSueClifford @W_minster_Park I will see you there!  :)  @London_Colleen @Arborized
There is a deer lying under a tree in our fenced backyard.  This is what I mean when I say the yard has become a forest &amp; not in a good way.
The Bee is ditching school tomorrow to go to Girls Rock I.T. @FanshaweCollege. She's NOT sad about missing Track &amp; Field Day.

@ardenmcclean Any size?  I could do some spring cleaning in the front closet! :)
@KarGair Did you see this?  
@markspowart17 @st3v3turn3r  Maybe they don't have Nikon lens mugs at @ubercoolstuff but I've seen them online. You need one to be legit.:)
@markspowart17 Canon rules!!  @st3v3turn3r - I'm sorry, but you're not turtle-y enough for the turtle club. PS They have Nikon mugs too! :)
@PeopleofLdnOnt @st3v3turn3r @ubercoolstuff It was funny because for a few seconds I thought it was a real lens &amp; nearly crapped my pants.
@st3v3turn3r Thanks!  It was fun!  The kids bought me a camera lens-shaped travel mug from @ubercoolstuff . :) 
@PeopleofLdnOnt Aw!  Thanks!  You were a quick learner!  :)
@rtraction &amp; @Childreach cleaned up! #ldnont #cleanandgreen 
@ShawnaLewk I see what you did there!  I need to "time travel" a snack for book club.  And some extra sleep. :)
@ShawnaLewk You have this!  It's a quick read!  Unfortunately we finished it a month ago. Hoping we remember enough to discuss!
@nataliese super sweet!  those tiny feet will grow into them &amp; then out of them quickly enough! :)
@CWChapter2 @late2game I'm a member of @TVTA_London_Ont and I can testify to its awesomeness.
@BRJJharvey @PeopleofLdnOnt I think that's what I love the most - the fact that nothing is match-y! :)

Better picture of my fantastical pickle tray for the win! #easter 
Perfect Pickle Tray for Easter Dinner - check! 
@MGirash Ooh, I've never been!  Now I have a reason to go!  :)
@ShawnaLewk I guess I can handle trusty sidekick of ED for now.  One day I'll work myself up to theDivine Disher of Desserts! :)
@ShawnaLewk Yeah, pickle tray. I was delegated the pickle tray. Who CARES about the pickles?  I want to be an Easter Dinner Hero!  Boo!!
Today's TO DOs: clean, take littlest to dentist &amp; create the most fantastical pickle tray for Easter dinner. #mostboringdayever

Good thinking!  @middleton_sj @ChildreachAnne
@ChildreachAnne Great question! When I was a kid, we got them at Zellers. I'm not really helping. :(
OH in the woods: Me-What is it? J-It looks like a hairless caterpillar. Me-You mean a worm?

@London_Colleen It was a collection of the best short films made by Laurier SS students!  @gabriellafranny made TWO of the 16 films! :)
We're at the Laurier Students Film Festival to watch @gabriellafranny 's cinema magique. 
@gabriellafranny There are raspberry coconut muffins in the kitchen. You should have some before bed. #MumsOrders
@late2game Nevermind!  I just remembered!  
Hey @late2game!  What was the name of that website you guys made that listed &amp; linked to local associations/clubs/groups? #LdnOnt
Would you believe me if I said she was finishing a yawn? 
@AwesomeBioTA I get that. It's certainly not an enjoyable technique for me either, but I do so LOVE the results!. :)
@AwesomeBioTA Thanks!  I just need to bind off the collar and graft the armpits, and then it will be ready to wear! :)
Just a little fair isle . . . 
@CityThink @chrismcinnis  I'm out!  I had to google "Graham Kerr"! #theGallopingGourmet  I clearly need to get me a catchy cook-y nickname.
@CityThink @chrismcinnis James describes it as "no trimmings,no romance".
@CityThink @chrismcinnis I had to go look mine up - it's called Quick &amp; Simple - TV Companion Recipes. :) #theUrbanPeasant
@chrismcinnis I have one of his cookbooks,and the recipes are all short paragraphs!  I love it! :)
@serser498  It was no mountains, but where there wasn't mud, there was ice. As for the book - I only have about 50 pages left to read!  :)
@KarGair Hashtag Brilliant. :)
Took advantage of the sunshine &amp; headed into the woods . . . I only fell down once. 
@KarGair Your Billy T's idea just got kudos at the @FemPoliLDN Municipal Campaign School! cc @st3v3turn3r
Now we wait for @bungibson and @BrianGibson13 's baby!
And another congratulations goes out to @PoeProdigy who welcomed Baby Alexandra this week! :) So many babies! So much cuteness!
@aimee_brewer You're hilarious!  I have Municipal Campaign School via @FemPoliLDN this morning, so you timed it well.  :)
@officeprincess A shout-out to you, too!  Congratulations on the arrival of Baby Emmett!  I can't wait to meet him in real life, too! :)
@aimee_brewer Congratulations, my friend!  Baby Victoria is beautiful!  I can't wait to meet her in person!  :)
@CanadianCheri Ditto!  :)
I'm the only one in the lunch room and there are leftovets with a sign to help myself. Okay. 
@Arborized My enthusiasm is based on knowing him for a long time and working alongside him. :)
@KarGair I should have picked you up one too!  Now we just need our " @st3v3turn3r  for Ward 11" t-shirts! #ldnvotes #BetterTogetherLdn

@late2game I found out on IMDB that he's producing &amp; acting in A Walk in the Woods which I am currently reading &amp; enjoying!  Serendipity?
@CityThink @late2game I was heavily medicated - too much cough syrup &amp; advil - and I'm sticking with that as my excuse! :)
I dreamt last night I was hanging with Robert Redford &amp; could not remember one single movie he was in. Woke up to IMDB him. Legal Eagles!
My tonsils hurt. Spending my vacation day at the walk-in.  The doctor is at lunch. :(

@Arborized Eek!  Too bad!
@AwesomeBioTA @Arborized Yes, Medway is a frequent hike that is offered.  Westminster, Meadowlily, Kains, Komoka, Warbler, etc.
@Arborized @TVTA_London_Ont Right - no dogs. All trails along the Thames river &amp; the ponds &amp; in parks.  1/3 of the trail is in #ldnont
@Arborized @TVTA_London_Ont They offer 5-ish guided hikes/week for all levels. I joined for the physical activity, but stay for the social.
@Arborized @TVTA_London_Ont It's $25/year. The $ goes to maintaining trails, leader training, printing &amp; mailing costs of newsletters, etc.
@Arborized I belong to the @TVTA_London_Ont - it's hiking, but hiking is walking, right?  I "think" there are 300+ members. It's big!
@London_Colleen It's a targeted housing strategy in Montreal with a 75% success rate. Success being graduating. :)

@kledgley I kept finding the jeans in the hallway &amp; putting them back in her drawer, but then she taped a little sign on them 'TOO SMALL' :)
@chrismcinnis How's this one?  
@kledgley I watched this in its entirety  
It's alive! @KarGair @ChildreachAnne @Childreach It only took 4 hours + water + love. 
Made a batch of all-natural liquid laundry detergent c/o  @hol_fit gillianmandich 
@thedamon That's the case for the entire online silent auction.  The tickets are for Wednesday, so bidding ends tonight. :)
Less than 24hrs to bid on 4 tix to Other Desert Cities @thegrandlondon - 
@KarGair Looking good! I cooked up a crockpot of chili in honour of the @LDNOSCO chili cook-off. Then the 4 of us ate it all. Can't move.
@SDesserud The dad makes pancakes at this house. It's why he's the favourite. I've competed with giant turkey dinners with a little success.
@AwesomeBioTA Happy Birthday!  Here's wishing you a day as AWESOME as you are! :)
@jameskingsley @London_Colleen Or is it "Let's NEVER not walk together again!"?I think it's this one.  Double negatives confuse me. Ack.
@jameskingsley We missed you! Let's NEVER not walk separately again!  #cnoy  @London_Colleen wanted to talk cool music &amp; I know nothing! :)
@aimee_brewer I hope you're okay!
@SDesserud You're too late!  We ate it all.  :)  It's like we were sleep eating. I'm pretty sure one of the girls went back to bed.
My plan to sleep in was foiled by the smell of applesauce pancakes, real maple syrup, orange juice and coffee. Might as well start the day.
@officeprincess @slowlygoing @knitty_kat @London_Colleen @aimee_brewer @PoeProdigy @elanknits I'm out too! :(

I just baked blueberry muffins &amp; forgot to add sugar.  The only way I'm eating these is drenched in maple syrup.
@ChildreachAnne Well I think @KarGair saw one of our secret 'celebrities' @AeolianHall !  There's so many of them that I'm not sure which 1.
@KarGair DM me the deets!!!  If my hunch is right, I'm so jealous!  And ON Valentine's Day!
@ChildreachAnne It sure makes for one late night!
@ChildreachAnne Only briefly! I went home to have dinner and now I'm at yoga. :)
@Arborized @London_Colleen Agreed!  I stopped responding to the survey because I didn't want to skew the results due to misunderstanding.
@London_Colleen Thanks!  Took me 5 minutes tops!  Fun with a glue gun. :)
Bask in my splendid cupid arrow glory!  
@Arborized There are super cheap &amp; awesome yoga classes at the Boyle Community Centre. I'm talkin' 10 for $40. I'll send you deets.
I shared this video last year before the @coldest_night walk, but posting it again. 
Here's why the girls and I will walk on the @coldest_night  - 
I'm walking this year's  #cnoy walk with @beahlearn &amp; @gabriellafranny &amp; @London_Colleen - sponsor us!  
Perfect day for decorating the house in hearts for Valentine's Day. I'm going to consult my pins &amp; get to work. 
@London_Colleen Ooh!!  Weakerthans! How could I forget?  Good recommendations! :)   Thanks!
Making a family birthday dinner playlist on grooveshark - any recommendations to please 3 generations?
@PoeProdigy @officeprincess @London_Colleen @SheSheKnits @knitty_kat @slowlygoing I'm cooking and cleaning for a family dinner. :(
@gabriellafranny  I didn't get you a card.   
Happy 18th Birthday @gabriellafranny !  You can vote now!!  :)  Woo-hoo!   #ldnvotes
This morning, took the teen to @EdgarAndJoes to reflect on her accomplishments.  Then the bank to put more $ into the education account. :)
@ChildreachAnne Awesome, right?  We ordered in pad thai to celebrate! :)
@StuartClark @gabriellafranny Thanks, Stuart!   She is very happy!
More good news!  @gabriellafranny just got accepted to @KUCatUWO too!  This kid is going to go places! (but stay in #ldnont !) #proudmum
@westernu Maybe!  We're checking the calendar! :)
@aimee_brewer I'd give you baby shizzle if I had it! :)  But it's been 11 years, and it's been given away already!
Happy day!  Minimum wage is going up albeit slowly AND @gabriellafranny got accepted @westernu !  #proudmum
@London_Colleen Call out for scarves and hats! :)  #cnoy #ldnont
@W_minster_Park You should link to your music page!!  That one that plays like a radio.  The name is escaping me!!!!  Argh!
@late2game Thank you for sharing this, Shawn.  #endstigma

@SDesserud I had been checking it every five seconds up until 7:20 &amp; I had other things to do like shovel &amp; get ready. :)
@aimee_brewer So Ella should be good. Phew!   Thanks!
@carlarolfe @AM980News Same here.
Kudos to @SaundersOne for letting their students know quickly about exams!  @mybigyellowbus @aimee_brewer @TVDSB Where's Laurier????
@TVDSB Will today's highschool exams be rescheduled?
@aimee_brewer   @TVDSB  I have an extremely stressed-out teen!  I haven't seen any messaging re:exams. #ldnont
@TVDSB If buses are cancelled, will highschool exams be rescheduled?
London Lightning!  #ldnont 
@Arborized Thanks!  The kids don't complain too often about having to eat freshly baked sweets.  :)
@arborized - Here you are!  Proof of lemon bread - it smells delicious. Next up: pot of tea. 
@Arborized I can share pics - just not slices. :) Just kidding! I will give my family limited time offers of lemon bread if they are nice.
I have this lemon bread in the oven right now - 
@kezzaloudoun &amp; I made BIG plans to snowshoe Hullett Marsh this a.m. with @TVTA_London_Ont but we're wisely staying home where it's warm. :)
It is a breakfast for dinner kind of day. 
@London_Colleen @FemPoliLDN @gabriellafranny  I was thinking the same thing! She's a bit stressed re: exams, so I'm waiting to #askher !
@LondonTrevor @st3v3turn3r  Delivering the lamb looked less painful than weaving a basket with hot steamy boiled wood. #victorianfarm
Just another Sunday night watching Victorian Farm &amp; I'm fairly confident I could deliver baby lambs if pressed.
@DHMakerBus @RyanHuntDH Thanks so much for meeting with us!  There is fun in the air!  Can't wait to work on some projects! :)
@beahlearn and I have a coffee date this a.m. @EdgarAndJoes with @DHMakerBus to organize a workshop of sorts for her @DIY Club. Excited!!
@elanknits @WFFarmerMkt Me too!
@elanknits Eventually I will knit one for the teen who is obsessed with everything Dr. Who (and pugs).  :)
@elanknits How 'bout the tilting tardis cowl - 
@jameskingsley Are you doing the @coldest_night walk on Feb. 22?  If so, you gotta be on our team - 
@jameskingsley I never say 5 Alive. Only Deli Cinq. And that's alot as it's the girls' juice box favorit. Adjectives should follow nouns. :)
@pluggedportable I wish every teacher embraced technology like you do! :)  
@London_Colleen Hmmm . . . I might have just the pattern! :)  If time becomes an issue, Beah just bought the cutest blue cardy from H&amp;M.
@London_Colleen Hurray for a new album!  Will it have the girl wearing a cardigan song??? :)
@PatatLFPress When I do that at work, no one gets it. :(  #curbyourenthusiasm
@BrianGibson13 That's twice today that Ticket to Ride in conversation has come up!  A sign? #addtogameshelf
@RSueClifford @London_Colleen The bonus of joining a team is that the $ we raise stays in London. :)  And then there's the good company!
@spillyjaneknits Thanks!  These would be a great knitted gift for Valentines Day - only 1 month away! :)
@WOTCHMH @BirthofaRunner @MySistersPlace If I didn't have to work, I'd be there in a heartbeat!  @orangeheromama ?  Know anyone?
@bookcheckgirl @DW_Programs @pluggedportable Me too! The Bee was excited about #girlsclub !
@London_Colleen 10 weeks $40 starts wednesday nights January 22?
@London_Colleen yes!
Where is the boyle activity council in the @WFFarmerMkt ?
@londonlibrary Very lucky!  Agreed! :)  Also lucky that we borrowed a giant pile of REAL books from the library last week.  We're stocked!
@londonlibrary Thanks, but I'm going to stick with your downloadable e-books and audio books today.  :)  #stayinside
@London_Colleen Did you love the music?  I've got a bit of it queued up in grooveshark.  Another excellent documentary is The People Speak.
@Joy_Birch My teen was fully dressed, lunch packed, drinking a cup of tea, and now she's back in bed. :)
@lisamay17 Good luck!  :)
@DIY is addictive!  We've baked cookies, whipped up hummus, made several bracelets with the loom, and a loaf of bread is rising.
@BeahLearn just joined @DIY at noon &amp; she's nearly completed the Minecrafter badge. Next up: Baker badge!!  #vacation
@London_Colleen My goal this year is to continue to be your friend. :)  Happy New Year!
@ardenmcclean Happy New Year to you too, my friend!
Big NYE plans: essay writing + chips + pop + knitting + manga + footloose + jammies + couch = happiness with a side of kevin bacon
Good read.  “When “Life Hacking” Is Really White Privilege” by @jendziura 
@London_Colleen @late2game I can't think of a better way to "waste" time.
@ChildreachAnne speaking of snowpants, @gabriellafranny has a Columbia invite for January! Woot woot!
@andrearoth888 Very pretty!  Merry Christmas!
Debated about getting dressed up for our family dinner, but decided on sweats. They're not pretty, but I'll be cozy and stuffing my face.
@AwesomeBioTA #nutmegtips
@AwesomeBioTA You got it!  Milk, butter and a dash of grated nutmeg.  It's exquisite.  I also add a dash of grated nutmeg to all my quiches.
@AwesomeBioTA Do it!
@AwesomeBioTA MMmmm . . . nutmeg!  I like to grate a little in my mashed potatoes like my grandmother did when I was growing up. :)
@gabriellafranny &amp; @BeahLearn just made a $25 @Kiva loan to a farmer in Cambodia.  
@KarGair @ChildreachAnne  Hey!  And no having fun today without me.  Save it for the New Year!  I'm house cleaning.  #nofundaymonday
HO HO HO!  For the love of Todd, take them home and enjoy. :)  @KarGair @ChildreachAnne
@BirthofaRunner Thanks, my friend!  Ditto to you!  I admire your wisdom, initiative, kindness and encouragement.  Mighty girls unite! :)
Stocking Stuffers! Ziraldo Alpaca Insoles. Small to XL. Thorndale, ON @zalpacas #shoplocal #ldnont  
Edgar + Joe's grilled cheese NO crusts - every kid's dream come true 
@lisamay17 Of course you got a shut-out!  You're the bestest goalie ever. :)
@lisamay17 Did you ladies win? :)
Made it home safely.  Rewarded my careful driving with a big cheddar + green pepper + red onion omelette.  #happyendings
Oh my Todd.  I just barely made it across town to pick up the teen. #ldnont roads are horribly dangerous. Still need to get back home. :(
Pls RT. Still need your help. You can make a child smile! drop a gift to LifeSpin today. Teens esp needed.  @lifespinorg 866 Dundas #ldnont
@officeprincess @PoeProdigy @slowlygoing @knitty_kat @SheSheKnits  I may flake out this a.m. I'm too cozy where I am. :(
@London_Colleen Holey moley mole!  EIGHTEEN??!?!?!?!  I still remember when he was voted most cutest baby in the world. :)
@officeprincess @slowlygoing @London_Colleen I may be able to pop in and out - I'm working PLUS I'm chauffeuring the teen.  9am?
@StJohn_N @BrianGibson13 @late2game  I second Keeping Kids Warm!  :)
@AbeOudshoorn Tomorrow is a busy night in #ldnont !  Rest assured there is always next year. :)
Who's all coming to A Christmas Carol tomorrow night at Centennial Hall? Admission is by donation to  @UPdatesLondon #ldnont
@London_Colleen You, my friend, are brilliant.  We'll work on that for next year. I have a sneaking suspicion the gifts were for her sister.
The Bee is squirreled up in her bedroom 'making' Christmas gifts.  I badly want to sneak a peek.
@BirthofaRunner @ml_baldwin @Igniter Have fun!
Santa + Bee 
@KristyFaith1 Anne of Green Gables
Home from yoga. Late night snack of grapefruit, salami, almonds + cheese w/a cup of tea.  Watching bad reality tv. Life is good.
Annual Decorating Grandpa and Grandma's Christmas Tree Day 
I'm presenting my 1st parent seminar next week on 'giving'.  It's free!  Want to attend? 
Oh, Snovember.  Stop already.
@ardenmcclean Ooh, that would be nice!  I could do Wednesday or Thursday.  Got any time there? :)
FACT: Poverty thwarts "good decision-making". Mr. Noodles cost a quarter. 
@London_Colleen That's impressive. I wove in ends on 2 xmas projects today &amp; knit a poop-tonne of rows on another. So much still to do.
@BirthofaRunner Jessie from @children_museum just called + the Tween Council is not expected to go to Chocolate Sunday. They're closed too!
@BirthofaRunner @lifespinorg It took HOURS + many neighbours to get the car IN the driveway. I'm afraid we're not going out today. :(
@BirthofaRunner That's all I'm thinking about!  I am supposed to help transport stuff from @lifespinorg to the @HiltonLondonON at 9am.  Eek.
@kevindividual It looked pretty until I tried shovelling it. I'm taking a coffee break before I tackle the second half of the driveway.
1/2 hour shovelling + I've barely made a dent.  Not loving the long driveway or the continuous snow squalls. Blurg.
@middleton_sj The challenge is going to be saving them for Christmas stockings. #iwantthem4breakfastlunchdinner  @RheoThompson
@AwesomeBioTA I like your style!  @RheoThompson
@AwesomeBioTA To be honest I was going to buy 20, but I talked myself down to 10. I know where my supplier lives. :)  @RheoThompson
I am weak to @RheoThompson mint smoothies fundraisers - I can't buy just 1 or 2.  Now I'm walking around with TEN in my purse!!??!!
After a week of eating soup &amp; baking cookies in the toaster oven, Josh fixed the stove oven!  #googletotherescue
#LdnOnt remember #ChocolateSundae is Nov 24! Get your tickets online 
@gillianmandich I didn't get to connect with you last night, but I wanted you to know you were awesome, my friend!  :)
@Jvonwahl11 Great talk last night!  Looking forward to hearing more about the London Moderates &amp; Freethinkers Advocating Openness. #ldnont
The Bee is an artiste. 
Soup &amp; Chili today! 
The 11 year old convinced me to wear a side bun today.  Jury is still out.
HILARIOUS! This is my second cousin's son dressed up as #RobFord and apologizing to the people of Toronto! 
@zalpacas Not one! The 2 yr old didn't know they were edible &amp; we were forbidden by her mother to feed her any. Plus she picks her nose. :)
Spent this afternoon building an aesthetically pleasing marshmallow + toothpick sculpture alongside a 2yr old. 
A lighter shade of pale . . . so sweet. #JnCSymphonic @JnCLondon Makes me want to rewatch The Big Chill.
Awesome concert @JnCLondon #JnCSymphonic . . . Loving the Peter Gabriel tunes!
Tonight the girls and I are @LdnCC with @kezzaloudoun for #jeansandclassics #ldnont Woot Woot!
The tween just watched the LEGO movie trailer + shouted excitedly, "It has MORGAN FREEMAN IN IT!!!" Since when did he have 11-year old fans?
@BirthofaRunner Not a problem!
@MurphyPaws That makes me feel worse, and @gabriellafranny just inserted, " Burn."
Is it really Halloween if no one comes to your door? :(  Is our pumpkin not pumpkin-y enough for the pumpkin club?
@elanknits It's now on hold at the library!
@elanknits Ooh, no.  I will have to add it to our reading list.  That being said, we could use a funny smile-y book next. :)
@AwesomeBioTA I'm finishing up a sock and then I'm knitting the 'gaptastic cowl' for a xmas gift. I have lots of xmas knitting this year!
@AwesomeBioTA Ah, yes!  Holiday knitting needs to be relaxing + conducive to a little drinking. :)  What are you going to knit next?
@AwesomeBioTA Blankets require a lot of discipline.  I've only made 2 in the 10 years I've been knitting, but I love them dearly.
The Bee + I just got teary eyed + choked up reading the end of A Little Princess. That's 2 books in a row to make us cry.
@AwesomeBioTA  Just in time for winter!!  It's beautiful!  I'm curled up under my knitted blanket too.  :)
@Arborized Meet @MurphyPaws
@AwesomeBioTA Did you see the tinkerbells + owls on pinterest? I did not have the required patience. :)
@AwesomeBioTA It's hard to tell, but the pumpkin on the left is supposed to be a minion. :)  The Jack pumpkin on the right was easy!
Pumpkins carved . . . Check. 
@ubercoolstuff We had so much fun last year, that the littlest &amp; her dad are going again! Keep an eye out! Sadly me &amp; the teen are working.
Volunteering at Woodland Heights Family Literacy Night #ldnont 
@CitizenCorpsLDN @GinaBarber_W9 "2.5 hrs spent talking about their own pay &amp; only 15 min. on how the city was doing." This made me sad.
Made the kid get off the couch and get groceries. 
@MurphyPaws  Just read the rules &amp; regs. Sadly @gabriellafranny  will in April 2014.  :(  Too old by two months.  Boo.
@PeopleofLdnOnt  I just laughed out loud!  That can NOT be good.  :)
@PeopleofLdnOnt Good point.
@PeopleofLdnOnt  I was inspired by your FRY-day greetings, so I found some fries drawn by my tween and huzzah!
@PeopleofLdnOnt She's got swords and stuff like fangs on her tail!  I'm a-scared.
Happy Fry-day! 
It's a mermaid warrior of course. 
@nicholasalxandr @TheTeaHaus  My 3 top fav-ah faves are 'Royal London', 'Sunday Tea' and 'Constant Comet Rooibos'.
@Childreach @GustoFoodWine Now I REALLY want to win that retreat!
@KarGair Twins weekend!
@KarGair @Childreach Oh NO-o-o-oooooo!!!!!
@MurphyPaws Hey!  Happy Thanksgiving to you, my friend!  Only 5 days away from the Fleece Festival!! :)
@AwesomeBioTA I've been away from the twitters!  I missed this!  That's HUGE and super awesome. :)
It's official! I've now hiked all 130kms of the ThamesValley Trail since April with @TVTA_London_Ont .  Very cool beans.
@AwesomeBioTA That's exactly what I was thinking. :)
@AwesomeBioTA Is it crazy to make mom &amp; daughter matching sweaters? I think I might have enough blue wool. :)  And I love me some chevron!
@middleton_sj That fruit turkey is ninja!
@AwesomeBioTA I'm working on this sweater for my tween - 
A productive morning = apple pie from scratch 
@AwesomeBioTA One pie is assembled + baking. Now I'm taking a break with my tea and knitting.  :)
@kevindividual Classic Johnny Fever! :)  I see a WKRP-in-Cincinnati-a-thon in the near future.
My pie pastry is chillin' in the frigo + the apples are sliced. Still need to make a pot of tea+cranberry sauce then assemble pies. Yum.
@kevindividual That's probably the only episode I remember, and I'm pretty sure I watched almost all of them!
These drurings are all over the house. #chibi #thebee 
Just worked 12 hours &amp; walked home 1 hour. A long day to end a short week.
@BrianGibson13 @bungibson What do you knit for a baby of two knitters????  :)
@BrianGibson13 @bungibson Hurray! :)
@lisamay17 Eek!  You still have to go back and pick him up!
@MurphyPaws I think @gabriellafranny is hoping the same.  It seems like it's just trickling out right now.  Fingers crossed.
@dyenamicyarn I'm just a wee bit down the road in #ldnont which puts me in a good position to forecast. Rain will begin shortly. :)
@ardenmcclean Oh, phew!  I thought maybe 8-hour meetings were getting you down. :)   I have more coffee to remedy stuff like that.
Just checked the weather for today.  It looks like thunderstorms on top of thunderstorms on top of more thunderstorms. #umbrellamaynotcutit
@ardenmcclean Not sure what you're up against this morning, but if you need an assistant, I'm your gal. :)  Whatever it is, you got this!
@middleton_sj I've not read it before.  The post about Fable and her brightness + smiles is super sweet + lovely.  cc/ @GirlsGoneChild
@gogreatlakesbay Will do! Thanks!
Hanging around Bronners #frankenmuth 
@lisamay17 Have fun with the boys, Lisa! :)  Make sure to take some pictures to share!
@orangeheromama There were some wasps, but they were too busy feasting on the massacred apples on the ground to bother with us. :)
Picked apples at Dwarf Tree Orchard this aft &amp; although the apples are badly pocked, they are still super delish. #ldnont #buylocal
Fall bouquet from the inlaws. Sweet. 
@BirthofaRunner We're pretty stoked too!  :)  It's going to take a lot of willpower to NOT talk about it in the car on the way.
I'd without a doubt vote for @mrjoshmorgan if he ran for mayor!  #ldnont 
Happy anniversary! @kargair says thanks @st3v3turn3r!  cc @KarGair Like the sash? 
@PeopleofLdnOnt @WFFarmerMkt This also happens to me when I forget to hide them.  Just don't hide them so well you forget you have them.
@MurphyPaws Those glasses are awesome! You did good.
@kirstythomson @MurphyPaws I didn't even try to preserve the colour!  :)  I'm so lazy.
Hogwash. She's going to say that because she's made a business out of it.  
@Saidat2motivate Consider it done!  She will freak out! :)
@Saidat2motivate I wish!  I just found out, but I have to work. :(   We saw you at the @Childreach Confidence is Beautiful mom-daughter day!
My littlest is so pumped to see @Saidat2motivate &amp; KZ tomorrow at school! #woodlandheights
@soljargon It was delicious treat!
The goal for this year's @unitedwaylm campaign is 8.9 million dollars! #ldnont
@AwesomeBioTA yes. :)
DRUMSTICKS!! #uwlondon #harvestlunch #ldnont 
Harvest Lunch at bud gardens for the united way campaign #ldnont 
Hole-y hot pink dots! I think it's time to add a second @katiehwalker scarf to my collection of one.  
No need to pack a lunch today!  @unitedwaylm Harvest Lunch @BudGardens &amp; my annual ice cream drumstick!  Yum! #ldnont
@FatherShaggy Ah!!  We're close to GT on Springbank &amp; Woodland Heights cemetery! We have lots of deer in the graveyard. :)
@FatherShaggy We must live close by because those are definitely two destinations we have on my daughter's way home from school. :)
@elanknits Don't feel guilty!  They have these sales to make room for new stuff!  Or is it that you don't need 9 more knitting books? :)
@MurphyPaws oh man! I forgot about the sale today.  I hit up the outlet yesterday though. Found the perfect pair of Levis!
The Bee is drinking her lemonade at Edgar + Joe's #ldnont 
@aimee_brewer I left it at the office, but I will send you the 'draft' on Monday - DM your email address. :)  I'm sure you could add some!
@AwesomeBioTA Ooh, another one to add to the list! :)  Thank you!

I started compiling a list of low &amp; no cost family activities this afternoon &amp; it's ridiculously long. This is why we're never bored.
@late2game I just wanted to reassure you that you did very well with your public speaking this afternoon. #patontheback  :)
@MurphyPaws  I'm going to steal her reading list for our Saturday mornings at the market! :) Maybe she'll let us help her with her homework.
@CWChapter2 I'll show her your picture, and make her look out for a familiar face! :)
First day at kings! westernu #proudmum 
We're getting lots of little outages in kensal park.  Our flashlights are at the ready!
@sweetstellas I dashed out to Byron to return some library books, and I could hear the thunder!  Back home again.  Phew!
@gracekellycakes Thanks! We're not too far from old south!  :)
@AwesomeBioTA cool.  :-)
Can someone tweet when it's safe to leave the basement?   I want coffee.  #ldnont
@AwesomeBioTA @APaperBuffet  I was downtown!
Lightning!
@MurphyPaws  She asked for chicken balls for dinner. That's not going to go well with yoga tonight. :)
Thanks@VivetteM !  @BeahLearn had so much much fun helping out! :)
@middleton_sj Thanks!  I try to capture my girls' beauty on their birthdays each year. I don't scrapbook, so this is the next best thing! :)
@late2game Thanks, Shawn!  She makes this parenting gig pretty easy. :)
@BirthofaRunner  Thanks Shawna! We're pretty proud of her. She is treating everything she's being given today as a gift! Even her cereal. :)
The Bee is eleven today. Time flies when you're in love.

@Bunni_Buns It was so nice to meet you in person this morning at the market!  :)
@BirthofaRunner @BrianGibson13 Agreed.  It's t-shirt warm in the market today. :)
@BrianGibson13 I'll be there at 9! :)
@knitty_kat 7-8am
@knitty_kat Absolutely.  She's awesome.   Are you?
@knitty_kat Nope.  The teen needs a ride to work.  Cue sadness.
@knitty_kat  @MurphyPaws @officeprincess @MandyPenney I'll be there at 9!
So stuffed from dinner, but found two cherry nibs that I HAD to eat before the girls found them and ate them. #reallybadsharing
@Bunni_Buns  I just found out they're called argiopes &amp; are harmless. See the lady-with-a-beehive-and-hands-on-her-hips pattern on them?  :)
Kids are still asleep. Josh whispers, "We should pack our stuff and move the car. " I nod. The littlest shakes her head, eyes still closed.
@MurphyPaws We're coming home today!  Camping can be checked off the list.  Need showers &amp; computers stat.  #knittersandfritters tomorrow!
Desperately need a cup of tea but I can not find my flip flops #camping

@ardenmcclean  I think I've already signed up, and if not, I need to remedy that! :)
@gabriellafranny Ooh!  That was a good one!  I liked her point about freedoms are nothing unless they're exercised. :)
Thank you @andrearoth888 for being a Colour Celebrity!  
@knitty_kat 7am
@BeahLearn is bringing back the Swatch like it's 1988.  I'm very jelly.
@kirstythomson Come to the knitter-fritter side.  We have sticks &amp; string.
Watching Client 9: The Rise &amp; Fall of Eliot Spitzer + baking zucchini muffins + knitting - just another Saturday night.
Summer local dinner - chicken + beans + beets 
Eco Mantis Festival at Boler Mountain - fun times! 
@Wine_Vinyl I feel like this is a dangerous question. Like Enya versus Michael Bolton.
@ardenmcclean Absolutely! :)  I'm usually there early Saturdays for yoga &amp; stay for #knittersandfritters .  Let me know when you're coming!
@MurphyPaws This is my MOST favouritest tweet ever.
@MurphyPaws Why isn't @Wine_Vinyl tweeting while balancing precariously on rocks and walking Wilco?
Thank you @slowlygoing for the fritters today!  It was a sweet treat! @WFFarmerMkt  #knittersandfritters
@MrsOceanstream I think so.  Turn it inside out and tackle it one piece at a time - the back, the front and then the sleeves :)
@MrsOceanstream Great idea! It's inside so it doesn't have to look pretty. Maybe a jersey cotton or flannel? Something soft?
@christine_moss Always nice to see you!
@MrsOceanstream Tweet it! :-)
The babies &amp; men are outnumbering the #knittersandfritters 
@MurphyPaws @officeprincess @kirstythomson Awesome.
@officeprincess I will probably still be here as long as I am not the only one here. :-) Make sense?
@RGwriting no probs! Life is busy. :-)
@PoeProdigy @officeprincess @slowlygoing @knitty_kat @MurphyPaws @SheSheKnits Me too!
@wildflowerwool @zalpacas Me too!  See you there! :)
@aimee_brewer Oh dear! I really do prefer being behind the camera. However, I am pretty pumped about the warmline!  Thanks!
@RGwriting Ah, I should have known!  Though your pic looked ridiculously similar to where I was hanging out. Nature.  It all looks the same.
@RGwriting You were in the woods too????  Whoa!
@RGwriting cool. Let me consult my calendar when I get out of the woods. :-)
Eating an apple and waiting for a ride home.

@markspowart17 The crowd was so large &amp; the vibe so intoxicating, I missed seeing my kid in the parade!  :) Happy long weekend to you too!
@markspowart17 That's a fantastic photo!  My daughter is holding the far corner of the red section!  She went w/some friends &amp; joined in! :)
@gillianmandich Eek!  That's really NOT good. I hope you can get some sleep soon. :(
@warpaintmedia open house &amp; we left a little something! 
AWESOME to see @eShepperd on Wharnciffe with a VOTE sign! #ldnont
@KarGair Me too!  Tonight's training session was awesome! We have a great Parent Connect team! @LondonerShobh @Childreach @ChildreachAnne
@MurphyPaws AWESOME!!  If you were able to register online in under 30 mins, you'll kill this run with your speedy keyboarding skillz.
@kezzaloudoun I would have nightmares for YEARS.  :)
@RGwriting We were a block away from @MurphyPaws too! :)  Next time we need to plan this better.
Thanks for the RTs @spankules &amp; @kezzaloudoun ! :)

@MurphyPaws @WFFarmerMkt @MandyPenney @jeremygreenway Agree!
@MurphyPaws Yummy, zucchini bread!  I just ate a giant salad using only vegetables from your garden including the dressing!
@BlipperKnitter Thanks!. I never thought knitting a blanket would be this enjoyable.  And it's been a great way to knit up the stash. :)
@kezzaloudoun How the heck did you manage to jog home after our tennis game?  :)  I barely managed to drive out of your 'hood - it's a maze!
@Halinthekitchen Short answer - yes.  It's old. Everyone &amp; their mother has one. BUT I think that it depends on your objective.
My summer knitting looks like a quilt! 
@Halinthekitchen I still do a post here and there to keep a record of our days.  It's just a place for me to keep my words and pictures.  :)
@MurphyPaws @late2game @BrianGibson13 I always thought my car looked a little naked. I'm going to need more string!
@chrismcinnis @Awesomeldn  Congratulations!   I was rooting for you in spirit! I had a date with my yogi that could not be missed. :)
View from my yoga mat in the park. 
@MurphyPaws I'm positive that I still have blueberries from last year in the freezer!
At Kustermans picking blueberries . . . JACKPOT! #ldnont 
Thank you @gillianmandich &amp; @lululemon for the yoga &amp; @fireroastedcafe coffee this a.m. Always lovely to connect with you and @Hol_Fit !
@nicholasalxandr It just seems like a pity to fry it up when it's so FRESH and delicious as is! :)
Salad for lunch made from fresh vegetables c/o  @WFFarmerMkt 
@MandyPenney We missed you!  We stayed plenty past 10, but @murphypaws and I forgot out knitting!  Yikes!
@aimee_brewer @StuartClark @elanknits @murphypaws It was nice catching up with you all this morning!
Tagged: @ChildreachAnne @warpaintmedia - 
Found these rainbow roses @WFFarmerMkt this morning! They'd be perfect for the 
@gillianmandich See you there!  :)
@NickSoave @SkylarFranke Cool!  Thanks!  :)
@gabriellafranny PLEASE let me help you with your homework.
@MurphyPaws I know!  I'm positively green with envy! How was storm watch?  I got to soccer &amp; they cancelled. :(
@SDesserud No sleeping in!  :)  @MurphyPaws &amp; @elanknits &amp; I will be there at 8am.
It's official. @gabriellafranny has a @westernu student card &amp; will be taking Intro to Social Justice + Peace @KUCatUWO in September! #WISE
@elanknits Ah, yes!  That makes plenty o'sense.  Pain is not good.
@MurphyPaws Good idea!  And it's also @HomeCountyFest this weekend!
@elanknits Perfect!  See you then. You can watch us eat the fritters. Fritters are my reward for waking up and stretching.  :)
@elanknits I'll be @fireroastedcafe 2nd floor of @WFFarmerMkt  at 8am, but I'll probably stay until 10am. (there's FREE yoga from 7-8am)
Are you in for #knittersandfritters tomorrow morning @WFFarmerMkt ? @wildflowerwool @elanknits @orangeheromama @SheSheKnits @PoeProdigy
@BrianGibson13  @bungibson We'll miss you!  We'll have to catch up another time.
@MurphyPaws  Yeppers. It won't feel good when we have to get up out of our beds, but once we get some coffee down, all will be fine. :)
@murphypaws #knittersandfritters ?  We can catch up!
#knittersandfritters cont'd - I'll be @WFFarmerMkt upstairs @fireroastedcafe at 8am. And there's free yoga from 7-8am too! #ldnont
@knitty_kat @officeprincess  @MandyPenney @slowlygoing @SDesserud @AwesomeBioTA @BrianGibson13 @bungibson #knittersandfritters tomorrow?
Join me!! #ldnont 
Bracing myself for a hike in Komoka Park with @TVTA_London_Ont - if you don't see me again, I've melted in the woods.
@middleton_sj It was awesome to finally meet you IRL yesterday!  :)  Your advice re: the colourfunrun.ca was greatly appreciated.
@birchbarksoap Wow!  Congratulations!
Fell asleep at yoga in the park tonight.  Woke up to @gabriellafranny whispering frantically, "MUM, wake up!!!! You're snoring!"
@adeburger Congratulations!  My certificate just came in the mail last month. I've been lazy about going out and getting a frame.
Last night at the cottage.  Watched sunset. Roasted marshmallows &amp; sang off-key around campfire. Cue sadness.
High up in a barn filled to the rafters with antiques. #vacation 
Nothing like hand washing and drying all of our dishes as a family. #vacation
Super proud of @gabriellafranny for getting accepted in the WISE program @westernu ! #smartie
Waiting for dinner to come to me. #vacation 
I have good counting squills when I'm schwasted.  #fivecrowns
@gabriellafranny just asked me if I was schwasted.
The little head is Josh in the lake. 
My view from the kitchen - need to start on the bacon and eggs and coffee. 
We made it to the cottage safer than this guy. 
@jaypestakespics That's super nice of you to say! And the lentil salad is gold, but I may have OD'd on it already.  :)
@gabriellafranny Never. I was a saint. Ask your grandparents.  Next up: I'm going to mosh on the soccer field. #trytostayalive
@gabriellafranny GET BACK ON THE GROUND!!! #freakingoutyourmum
@gabriellafranny I meant to lend you my rain poncho but forgot. :(  #rainingcatsanddogs
@debbiedas : Meet your newest customer, @AwesomeBioTA ! She is interested in some hand-dyed wool! :)
@paisley_girl73 I've been meaning to make my way down the street and check out the new cafe!  I love the @Goodwill_OGL !
Game over. londonmajors lost by only run. #ldnont 
It's getting dark &amp; there is still one inning left. londonmajors #ldnont 
@_Andrea_Brown The concession stand is popping fresh popcorn just for us! :) @londonmajors
@AwesomeBioTA We went to @debbiedas 's kitchen! :)  She has a nice little set-up AND skillz.
Running the bases at the top of the 5th. 
At Labatt Park watching some intense baseball. #ldnont @londonmajors
The bee's knitting her first hat with her own hand dyed wool. 
@MurphyPaws I love the Katamari tunes!!  Does that make me geeky?
@librarykevin I'm relieved it's not just my kid!  And it's not just Minecraft. Maybe it improves their play?  :)
@MurphyPaws She is simultaneously watching minecraft videos. Videos of other people playing minecraft?  I don't get that part. #geekykid
My baby is knitting a hat in the round using her own hand-dyed wool that she made with @debbiedas ! A knitting mama's dream come true.
@SDesserud Oh dear!  I was there at 7am, so when it rolled after 10, it was time for me to go!
@librarykevin I like the space &amp; the staff at Westmount!  And there's a drop-in knitting group on Wednesday nights. :)
@gabriellafranny And every now and then, we'll throw down some food.
@gabriellafranny There's a bed down there.
@PeopleofLdnOnt Agreed. Yoga + knitting + friends + dutch apple fritters + @fireroastedcafe + @WFFarmerMkt = perfect Saturday morning!
@PeopleofLdnOnt  Will do! I can't make it the next 2 wknds. Pencil in July 20. NOTE I do the free yoga class there 7-8am &amp; then stay after.
@PeopleofLdnOnt @SDesserud ABSOLUTELY!  All knitters welcome!
@PeopleofLdnOnt @SDesserud We kind of throw it into the twitterverse on Fridays!  We should start an email list or a FB page to organize.
@PeopleofLdnOnt @SDesserud It's an informal gathering of knitters Saturday mornings @fireroastedcafe &amp; we take turns buying the fritters!
@SDesserud By the way, we missed you this morning at #knittersandfritters .  I was looking forward to meeting you in person! :)
@PeopleofLdnOnt I know!!  It's a slippery word to spell, but I didn't see the uppercase C coming!  My parents consoled me w/Chinese food.
@PeopleofLdnOnt When I was in Gr. 5, I came in 2nd at a county-wide spelling bee because I spelled Celsius with a little 'c'. :(
@SDesserud I'll have to remember that for next time!  Normally I send all the kids' books to their school for book sales too. :)
@londonlibrary I would have even donated the books to you too, but I had bags of clothing &amp; misc. stuff, so it was 1 stop @Goodwill_OGL !
@librarykevin We're kind of between Byron &amp; Landon, but I usually send my holds to Westmount.  Weird, eh?
2nd trip to @Goodwill_OGL  in 24hrs from cleaning the basement!  Donating books galore. From now on, we borrow from @londonlibrary ! #ldnont
@SDesserud @knitty_kat @MurphyPaws @WFFarmerMkt  Clothing is not optional!
@SDesserud @knitty_kat  I'm here already with @MurphyPaws ! Join us for #knittersandfritters @WFFarmerMkt
@MurphyPaws @knitty_kat Sounds good!
@MurphyPaws I plan on going tomorrow morning!  I think @knitty_kat is visiting family this week?
@gabriellafranny 11-year old Ibrahim loves you and the dark lord of the sith. #starwars #nerdlove #babysittercrush #cupcake
Roxy is panting from our trail run. 
@MrsOceanstream I know!!!  My blood pressure skyrocketed.  Thankfully I just meditated it away at my yoga class with @unshackld ! :)
Drove home behind a blue BMW with the licence plate "1PERCENT".  Really?
@j0_mAmA I tested out the boots over my ankle gash, and it looks like the boots will be fine.  Look out mucky trails, here I come! :)
Waffling before my 2.5hr hike.  Hiking boots or my runners?  NOTE: I also have a gash on the inside of my ankle from a soccer cleat. :(
@MurphyPaws @_Andrea_Brown My only issue was with the mosquitos! :)  And it was starting to get dark.
I took advantage of the rain &amp; ran outside to weed the yard - much easier pulling them up when they're wet.
@Canucklehead_ca  Agreed!  I've already queued up all of his songs for playing over and over. :)
@brian_frank Me too!  I didn't see it coming. :)
Highly recommend watching Searching for Sugar Man! What are you waiting for? 
Our friend of childreach award goes to Caroline! 
@gabriellafranny Yes.  We are going to need some t-shirts to support this.  Or buttons.  I'm good friends with a button-maker machine.
@gabriellafranny I say start planning for your senior prank.  You can top this.
@gabriellafranny Really?   Alive or dead?  Never mind. Don't tell me.
On my list of to do's this weekend - @OPALondon !  I love me some baklava and moussaka! :)  #ldnont
@ardenmcclean The LFP piece on you is as awesome as you are, my friend! :)
@MurphyPaws I'm so happy you found us!

#nuitblanche #ldnont #youngfolks
Breakfast at Trissa's 
@knitty_kat Next Wednesday is the last class before the summer break.  You should go! I can't because I have to work. Cue sadness.
@knitty_kat I skipped @igniteldn for yoga.  I'm feeling very stretch-y and relaxed.  How was it?
Spent the last hour in the garden at @lifespinorg planning this year's Chocolate Sunday fundraiser!  I'm excited! #ldnont
@st3v3turn3r Agreed!  @KarGair is missing out on all the fun @Childreach today. Bad day for vacation. :-)
She dropped her orange peel. 
Baby Meaghan visits the lunch room! 
@MurphyPaws I'm still amazed. To be honest the whole power cord and sharp blades scares the cheesus out of me which is why Josh  mows.
@T_Michael_Clark That's what I said!  I guess we thought that with 24 of us we would have outnumbered them. :)
@HeatherGoesWest  I'm sure my daughter says the same thing!  :) cc/  @gabriellafranny
Despite the aggressive coyote warning from the police, we hiked into Kains Woods this morning &amp; lived to tell - 
Just laughed my butt off at @thegrandlondon ! Now off to bed to get up early for a 10km hike with @TVTA_London_Ont ! #ldnont
@SDesserud @BrianGibson13 @WFFarmerMkt @MandyPenney @bungibson @MurphyPaws @knitty_kat @slowlygoing @officeprincess Absolutely!
@BrianGibson13 Yes!  #knittersandfritters @WFFarmerMkt with @MandyPenney @bungibson @MurphyPaws  @knitty_kat @slowlygoing @officeprincess
@SDesserud I LOVE those books you can NOT put down!
@BrianGibson13 We managed to get down to @ourstreetlondon too!  It was great to see so many people out.  Also enjoyed the Rag Bag Bazaar!
@BrianGibson13  I missed the market this morning - lounging around in my jammies won out.  There was so much to do in #ldnont today!
@BrianGibson13 It was!  We biked along the river to the university, laid out under a tree and had a picnic, and then biked home. #ldnont
@Joy_Birch We were out biking and had apple slices in the jar, so we ate the apple slices, and split our bottle of beer. :)
Strawberry beer in a mason jar . . . Yum 
Fruli &amp; brie &amp; cherries &amp; apples &amp; biking 
For dancing . . .

@MurphyPaws Me too!!  My fancy tea cups never see the light of day!
@MurphyPaws I just pulled out all tea in my cupboard, and the stash is out of control!
@MurphyPaws SCORE! :)
@BirthofaRunner We'll miss you tonight at book club! But dock yoga sounds like bliss! I have plans for the same the 2nd week of July. :)
Thinking of my friend who's husband is an Ornge pilot. Hoping he's safe.
@chrismcinnis My little family would have gotten that! :)
@chrismcinnis I like that you made up a word to describe what's going on here.  I will be applying the use of  'jambaroo in the office.
@gabriellafranny @BeahLearn I have questions.
The mantle still looks wintry. 
@SDesserud @j0_mAmA @kimforge Yes - Baseline!
@j0_mAmA @kimforge  I have a soft spot for Acadian Vanilla (just a hint of maple syrup!) and Raspberry Bugaboo!
@kimforge The #ldnont Ice Cream Factory has ruined all other ice cream for me.  They are the BEST.
@chrismcinnis I have TEN litres of ice cream in the freezer.  I'm set for June. :)
@chrismcinnis "Changeovers" is the 5 litres of ice cream between batches eg. vanilla to creme brulee. It's 1 tub for $13 or 2 tubs for $25!
Went to the #ldnont Ice Cream Factory &amp; the guy behind the counter found me 2 giant tubs of vanilla changeovers. #Ifellinlove
Cream scones &amp; cucumber sandwiches 
High Tea 
@aimee_brewer I must have just missed you @WFFarmerMkt ! I missed the maple bacon cookies!
@gillianmandich @Hol_Fit Great seeing you @WFFarmerMkt for yoga bright &amp; early!  I'm ready to tackle the day now. :)
Exclusive contest for Fanshawe Alumni: Win tickets to see Pearl Jam at Bud Gardens! 
@MrsOceanstream @MurphyPaws @tanneramma Let's do it swings of century style except we'd need a carnie 24-7.  I think we just created jobs.
@st3v3turn3r Heck yeah."Take all the fruit that you want to eat!
 It's gonna be a fruit salad treat!"  :)
Fruit salad yummy yummy 
@MurphyPaws It looks awesome!  That's a LOT of work! :)
Grandpa got an iphone. He is the tech-iest 82 year old ever. 
I joined a new soccer league in Komoka &amp; instead of oranges, there's a cooler of beer. Huzzah!
@knitty_kat @slowlygoing @PoeProdigy @officeprincess @orangeheromama @MurphyPaws @SheSheKnits I have plans all morning. Sorry! :(
@KarGair I just had a celebratory half a fruli (strawberry beer) 'cause it's my Friday! :)  Enjoy the quiet office time tomorrow.
Sunset 
Sun setting in my hood. 
@gabriellafranny I'm adding it to my resume.
@CWChapter2 My first instinct was to get out the camera. :)  My second  instinct was to burn the bag.
@gabriellafranny Dad said I probably got the spider egg from our hike on Sunday. I had it in Grandpa's car! Good it didn't burst in there!
@MurphyPaws I saw the bag outside, brought it in &amp; said hi to the fam. Then Josh asks me if I saw my bag. I said yes. Why was it outside? :(
Officially creeped out by the zillions of spider babies all over my tote bag. Heeby jeeby to the… 
I've got this on repeat while I bake chocolate chip scones - 
Trillium 
Happy Mothers Day!  I have forbidden the girls to grimace for 24 hours.  Be nice to your mums!
@gabriellafranny We've got things to do! Places to go!  People to see! No time for hugs!
@RSueClifford Don't be sad! I'll give it to you for your last bid!  I took the picture, so I can print it out poster-size for myself.
@RSueClifford I may have outbid you on Bike Trail @CaringBtL  And then @KarGair  told me you REALLY wanted it. I'm so sorry!

King street bridge #ldnont 
Caring Between the Lines is almost over. #ldnont 2 minutes! 
@Ryanstarky Hurray!!  Congratulations, Ryan, Lauren &amp; Finn!  :)
@KarGair @theartsproject @st3v3turn3r It's lookin' awesome!  I was wondering about that too!  Thanks! :)
@KarGair @theartsproject @CaringBtL @st3v3turn3r  I'll be there for the last hour with my cheque book! :)
@MurphyPaws @Canucklehead_ca @Newswriter22 I plan to get there around 4 and stay to the end! :)
@WFFarmerMkt I bought half a dozen of them this morning.  I can attest to their deliciousness. :) #ldnont
@gillianmandich @fireroastedcafe @lululemon Fantastic picture!
@gillianmandich Knitting yoga!  Very dangerous indeed! :)
Perfect way to start the weekend - yoga @WFFarmerMkt  at 7am with @gillianmandich leading us PLUS coffee from @fireroastedcafe ! #ldnont
@CaringBtL Thanks!  I just didn't want to miss the closing bids! :)
@lisabondy @CaringBtL I wouldn't complain! :)
@CaringBtL What time will the bids close tomorrow?
I'm telling my family I baked them banana-strawberry scones. I will leave out that the banana was black &amp; the strawberry yogurt expired.

Cool stuffs to look forward to this month - @citysymposium @Grickle_Grass &amp; @CaringBtL #ldnont
@gabriellafranny You don't sing and dance and rock it out always. :-)
@gabriellafranny  After reading her twitter profile, your dad just called @BeahLearn the anti-Ella.
Fingers crossed to win the Mother's Day contest @LondonMoms  
@ardenmcclean You're very kind!  I got your email on Friday &amp; I am always up for coffee with you. I just need to check my calendar. :)
@ardenmcclean That's awesome!  I had to hold up my bowl of chili.  You almost can't tell how horribly nervous I was. :)
@MurphyPaws I still have half a cake.  I'm saving it for an after-yoga snack. Yum-yum. Om.
@andrearoth888 Aw, thanks!  That means a lot. :)
Cake.

@UPdatesLondon Do you know when you will be drawing the door prize at UPwithART on Saturday night? Just planning when to get there.
@nataliese  And in the morning too! :)
@nataliese Thanks!  She LOVES it. Success!  And just in time for the weather to warm up.  :)
@gabriellafranny De rien, ma petite bijou.  Meow, meow.
I finished the 17th birthday sweater! And it fits perfectly. Phew. 
@officeprincess @PoeProdigy @slowlygoing I'm feeling the same way!  I'm going to spend the morning being lazy in my jammies.
@soljargon Thanks, Fred!   You'll have to pop into The Arts Project in May with Isaac &amp; @debbiedas to do some colouring! :)  @CaringBtL
Dropped off the Bee @MashupKids this a.m. to spend her PD Day singing, dancing &amp; making!  #ldnont
@MurphyPaws You guys did a great job on it!
@devilishone We JUST got home from TWO hours at the dealership.  I'm sorry I missed knit night. :(
@devilishone Thanks, Will!  I hope to make it out tonight. It depends - Josh wants to go look at cars. Bleh.
My 'Bike Trail' photograph was selected for the @CaringBtL exhibit next month! What an honour!  #ldnont 
@gabriellafranny Dance with me! 
@MurphyPaws holy shizzle!  That looks awesome!!  @gabriellafranny will be jelly.
@gabriellafranny  Remember when Beah used to say Super Mario 'bros'?  That still makes me laugh. For the record, I was wearing sheep's wool.
@gabriellafranny At least you're incorrectly spelling "consistently" consistently.
@gabriellafranny I saw a llama today on my hike.  It just looked at me.  Intensely.
I'm now a official card-carrying member of the @TVTA_London_Ont  A few pics from today's hike! #ldnont 
@slowlygoing @MurphyPaws @officeprincess @knitty_kat  Vanilla slices r a kind of pastry-custard-fondant sandwich. The best r in wdsk.
@officeprincess @slowlygoing  @MurphyPaws @knitty_kat  I am going 2 Woodstock Farmers Market 4 vanilla slices!  I may pop in on way back.
@gillianmandich  You captured the cables perfectly! :) This is the best picture of the sweater so far, and I've been knitting it for months!
@Joy_Birch @gillianmandich @MurphyPaws Another fun knit night!  Thanks! :)

My friend Robyn is giving away one copy of Jane Richmond's Island ebook with 5 sweet knitting patterns! 
@AbeOudshoorn  I was reminded that it's the simple things that make an ideal community Eg. acceptance &amp; work &amp; seating &amp; showers! :)

@knitty_kat @RachaelAshe Very cool!
@knitty_kat I was browsing a knitting graffiti book last nite at Lynn's, and THERE's your sister! 
My favourite part of cooking a turkey dinner is making cranberry sauce &amp; licking the spoon!  Happy Easter!
Washed the car, baked bread, registered for more yoga, donated 2 boxes of books to Goodwill &amp; went to the @WFFarmerMkt - time for a walk!
@officeprincess @slowlygoing @orangeheromama I'm dressed and eating my cereal!  I'll be there shortly! :)
@officeprincess @slowlygoing @orangeheromama @wildflowerwool  I'm still wearing pajamas. :(
@officeprincess @slowlygoing @orangeheromama @wildflowerwool I'm running later than usua, but I'll be therel &amp; @MurphyPaws is sick.
@slowlygoing @officeprincess @MurphyPaws @knitty_kat @orangeheromama @PoeProdigy I'll be there! #knittersandfritters

My favourite beer is strawberry beer. What does that say about me? #fruli #igniteldn
@igniteldn in the balcony 
I want money to fly out of my chimney. #igniteldn
@knitty_kat @MurphyPaws Hilarious! @igniteldn
@ardenmcclean Good to see you this morning @WFFarmerMkt . We'll have to work on timing, so we can actually talk for longer than two minutes!
@WesternEng we had to tweak the elastic a bit &amp; then it worked really well!
Ate a full plate of baklava &amp; then signed up for the dragon boat races in June at Fanshawe Lake. I'm the drunk dialler of pastries. #ldnont
