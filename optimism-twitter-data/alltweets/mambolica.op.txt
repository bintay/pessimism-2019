@ReinhartG @matttbastard I never said "all". Racism is difficult, pervasive. Even the best meaning person can be complacent. I have been.
@matttbastard @RCaranci I should add that means we have to fight even harder to combat inherent and institutionalised racism, not give up.
@matttbastard @RCaranci  Attitudes of us/them are inherent and institutionalised.
@matttbastard Immigrant populations. Outsiders. Not the power/status group.
@matttbastard Exactly. Only white Londoners actually think racism in Ldnont is subtle. It's not.
@iratemixedchick I'd be happy to. PM me if you like and we can chat.
@iratemixedchick a few yrs back I interviewed recent black immigrants and one talked about the "Pepsodent Smile" white people used on her.
@iratemixedchick it's also the only city I've lived where being Jewish made me uncomfortable. I'd never heard "Jew" used as a verb before.
@iratemixedchick my MA thesis was on de-mythologyising Ldnont's black history. It's like Ldners are proud of their privilege + prejudice.

Mine would definitely include "A Boy and his Dog", an often forgotten post-apocalypse story from 1975. Not a perfect movie, but very good.

@JasonFredin @HistoryLeagueFC some heritage applications + designations info is available at UWO's Archives. Prolly London Room, too.
@JasonFredin @HistoryLeagueFC Also if Ldnont handles its heritage surveys like other municipalities, applications should include dimensions.
@JasonFredin @HistoryLeagueFC ... I believe a number of the heritage buildings were surveyed in the '80s by local historians and published.
@JasonFredin @HistoryLeagueFC Like physical dimensions? If not, old insurance fire maps can answer some questions....
@spoonmenband rocking the '90s acoustic-style @Poachers_Arms under new LED stage lights. 
@BaronSandwich under the new lights at @Poachers_Arms tonight. The kazoo kind of makes him look like a Honker, tho. 
@adriannerussell programming is definitely   a way around that. With supportive direction, the sky's the limit!
@adriannerussell sometimes these kinds of issue-based exhibits are easier for small museums. Big ones are on long, inflexible schedules.
@adriannerussell oh I know, I've curated 'difficult' topics myself, but the will to do it isn't always up to curatorial staff.

Back to museums for a min. I want to publicly thank the amazing Centennial students who put on a terrific @mCULTUREm symposium...
In non-museum news, I am learning that @Poachers_Arms loaded Mediterranean bruschetta and cowl neck sweaters make for an embarrassing combo.
@ninaksimon I referenced your post about the Participatory Museum, 5 years on, actually, as it totally reflected themes in my talk.
@ninaksimon There's not too much there, yet.  With almost 20 years in museums, I suspect I have a lot to say!
Sounds like the #UofT Engineering #Skule band is outside the @mCULTUREm symposium, supporting striking TAs. #solidarity
Amazing compliment received, "As far as I'm concerned, you are Canada's @ninaksimon." Whoa, thanks! I can aspire (and inspire) to greatness.

@pixiepaperdoll7 @BaronSandwich  oh man, I want to do ARSTWAK _so bad_!  Comedy, drama, pathos, catharsis - it's practically Shakespeare !
Isn't it amazing the way something can transport you? A museum visitor came in with the accent of my Brooklyn childhood. It was a warm hug.
@PyreProductions Come here and show me that so I can shove your face in a snowbank. *grumble*

@Fluevog I love kids' expressions when they learn something cool and unexpected. Their enthusiasm is contagious! #loveyourvogs #museums
@PyreProductions Clearly what @secretsofradar needs to do for a fundraising campaign is create an 8-bit video game about #WW2 radar! Grats!

@c_cranley it was in addition to the stuff you're supposed to put in. I used a slightly chunky organic pb, unsweetened.

@Folsomtime I really like Capaldi, but his Dr's defining trait is that he's totally not 11 w/out much else. It's hollow and weak writing.
@Folsomtime I agree about 11, but the writing's been so uneven + w/so little depth that he's as much, but on the op side of the spectrum.
To be clear, I really like Capaldi and think he could be an incredible #DrWho. He has gravitas + charisma, but his Dr is a caricature. :(

@secretsofradar  I did another interview this AM at Sunnybrook's Vets' wing, this time a Navy radar vet. #history is full of good stories.
@heritagetoronto @DavidSoknacki @ROMtoronto The ROM can only collect and preserve so much. Archaeology collections take up lots of room!
@heritagetoronto @DavidSoknacki @ROMtoronto  just underwent a massive reno that only partially solved it's massive collections crisis.
@Onion74  that's love.
@heritagetoronto   I'm not sure @DavidSoknacki is aware that many museums have been leading the charge in accessible, community culture.
@CBCOntarioToday Make-up artists always try to pencil thru my scarred eyebrow, but the gap is part of my quirky face and I love it.
#LdnOnt garbage collectors left my neighbour's cans like this, wheels busted off, mid sidewalk. Nice, guys, really. 
Skanking requires panties that stay in place, lest it become a different kind of skanking. Choose your underwear wisely, my friends.

But, why not? That dino's a herbivore!   @ROMtoronto @ROMpalaeo ;) 
Listening to medieval music- I was a ROM co-op student, I did my homework here when the exhibit was new. @ROMtoronto and me, we go way back.
It's nostalgic. I see my old @ROMToronto friends, the artefacts and the faces who worked w/them: Kevin, Mary, Ron... 
I'm really glad some of the @ROMtoronto's hadrosaurs have wall display space, even if they're not in a herd. 
The Bloor St Chanel store has a vaguely 1st Nations inspired Old West thing going on in its display. Cultural Appropriation ftw. #sarcasm
Managed to ignore the bros until trapped in packed, moist streetcar with them. I wonder if that's how #TOCouncil feels with the Ford bros.
I am finding all the bros and dbags in the Virgin Mobile reserved boxes very distracting. They're more into pizza + beer than Soundgarden.
@BaronSandwich @erinjohannson I saw @nineinchnails in Winnipeg in '05. In a blizzard. But I've never seen @soundgarden; I'm excited!
Deodorant, dude. Is that so much to ask?
@WomenOfHistory @LdnOntDenise  My mom has often said as much.
Strangely conflicted after listening to last night's @BlueJays game. Hated the loss, but loved @jparencibia9 - I admit it, I miss him.
Oooh, my prize came today!   Thanks @drcarlen and #DivaCup! 
Also, @CWolf do have a terrific birthday. :) All the best and many more to come, etc., etc.
@nikharron do they have to be real? Hanibal Nectarine, perhaps? #serialkillerfoodies
@nikharron What if the owner's name is Jack?
@CWolf still, Black men and women have been cosplaying Cap and Thor for years. Really, it's just Marvel playing catch-up. @CBCArts
@CWolf I mean, they're comics. They're fantastic, in the true sense of the word. It mirrors reality, but it's all make-believe.  @CBCArts
@CWolf They know that, too, and it gets played up in the Cap films. Oh, fun times!  The shake-ups create hilarious nerdrage.  @CBCArts
@CWolf Cap can be any gender or race, really, because he's an idea(l). It gets trickier when the persona is the role.  @CBCArts
@CBCArts  This I can get behind, for all kinds of reasons. @cwolf what do you think?
@CWolf Exactly. Many cool fem characters, but always as supporting roles. It's a good gesture, but probably one that won't stick.
Awful, but also amazeballs.  "@CrapTaxidermy: "I put my Wings up in the air sometimes, singin Ayo, I'm a Sparrow!" 
@CWolf That is exactly what I said. It sounds gimmicky. I have been waiting for a meaningful fem hero to get her own starring run.
@diannenice @globeandmail @dj_friend  Coffee porters are delish. Chances are Tim's coffee-beer will be just as bad as Tim's coffee, tho.
@CWolf  Cheese is a necessary part of any successful burger - or birthday!
@drcarlen  I wish I had the $ for that. I used to go regularly to see friends perform back when I lived in TO. I love -real- burlesque.
@wpbray  Ken Burns is one helluva doc filmmaker and "Baseball" is what put him on the map. I love his work, but this one's my favourite.

I am unintentionally following a dude wearing a luchador mask and cape. Sometimes this city is surprising.
Eff ya, @Fluevog shoes on stage at #RumRunners #LdnOnt. Good choice, @BaronSandwich ! 
@Onion74  I have a Q10 - didn't even know it had been a thing.
@wpbray @DonTheMask  Maybe it's not so much the players but their movement up and down? Seems to me that would make team cohesion tricky.
@Onion74  there are custom tones? I had no idea.
@GlobeArts @globeandmail  phew, I have a few years before my curtain-call, then. I am so relieved.
@BarackObama absolutely. You put the money in the pockets of people and they spend it driving growth. It should be a no-brainer.
