#healthNL 
Thanks for engaging and for the discussion.  For patients, all about how it is framed by involved physicians. #lcsm 
Many patients have been screened &amp; cured in institutional programs/trials. Many more "incidentally" screened &amp; cured 
Thanks Janey! 
@paula_span Please take a look at my comments on nytimes site if you get a chance.  Thanks for article &amp; bringing up screening conversation.
Appreciate you reaching out and your integrity.  Just troubled by the absence of positives.  #lcsm 
@paula_span Respectfully disagree. Article focused on downside, not positives. "Guillotine over my head"? How about "saved my life"? #lcsm
@LungCancerFaces @findlungcancer @jay4man My comments are posted on nytimes site.
@RescueLungLDCT Hope it gets published.  I tried to comment on line but still hasn't posted.
Hey #lcsm--comment on this. Why is screening often cast in negative light?  Assessing Value of Lung Cancer Screening

@freetobreathe My pleasure!  Thanks for supporting patients &amp; research.  And for putting my picture on your website! 
Thank you guys.  Incredible goal. 
@LungCancerFaces @JFreemanDaily Need to get @ShandaBlackmon &amp; @WomenInThoracic involved in the #lcsm chats---powerful voices and advocates.
Let's get past the "blame game" for lung cancer.  Ridiculous stigma.  #NoStigma #lcsm 
Good night to all.  Thanks for all of the support this week.  #lcsm is incredible!
Give hope to your doctors.  Many of them just don't know any better, through no fault of their own. Educate and inspire. #lcsm

T4.  Put yourself out there in the spotlight. Speak. Challenge. Dare. Advocate. #lcsm
It really makes a difference! MT @MimiProvenzano: @BrendonStilesMD Tell him your patients KNOW you share a connection. #lcsm
Really important MT @JFreemanDaily: T3: Share your treatment data in databases so Big Data can help us learn about #lungcancer. #lcsm
One of my colleagues asked me today why I would tweet that my dad died of lung cancer. He couldn't understand. It is because of #lcsm
T3.  Please, please consent to biobanking.  It may not help you, but it will help others.  That is another kind of hope.   #lcsm
T3.  Explore clinical trials.  They are daunting, but take the time to understand.   #lcsm
T3.  Great points about screening.  Get the word out to everyone you know at risk.  This is going to move the survival numbers.   #lcsm

Always great to connect patients to researchers.  Hope is the life of a scientist. #lcsm
One of my favorites, the @Lung_Fund inspires hope through support of research.  #ResearchBeatsCancer #lcsm
T2. Connecting with others is key. Have to figure out how to reach out to those who aren't natural advocates or who don't have support #lcsm
@1111linno Too true! #lcsm
Totally agree. MT  @BrendonStilesMD data on mutation load &amp; response to immuno-tx, getting a report w/ many mut's = useful #lcsm
@1111linno Only problem is that "palliative" care means no care to a lot of people not in the field.  Have to better define.  #lcsm
Important--but don't forget immunorx too--new hope MT @kimberlydlester: @geekbabe  you have to get genomic profiling done on tumor! #lcsm
@coffeemommy It's a battle against HOPELESSNESS!!!!
T1.  Agree with idea that survivor stories are very powerful and go a long way.  Have to disseminate to those off-line #lcsm
Listening is at least half the battle.  MT @coffeemommy: HOPE: Listen first. I can be hopeful if I trust we have same goals . T1 #lcsm
T1.  Healthcare providers have to get a better handle on quality of life and on support systems.  #lcsm
Toe tags suck.  Not helpful or hopeful. #lcsm
T1:  Healthcare providers can't be afraid to say "I don't know" or "I'm going to get you help".  #lcsm
T1.  Stats are ok.  Bland recitation of the stats are not.  All has to be given in context.  Always say "we're going to find a way" #lcsm

Last thought…let's fund some research for companion diagnostics for screen detected nodules and/or for risk stratification. #lcsm
Good night everyone.  I love talking about screening for #LungCancer.  &amp; learned a lot from all of you. #lcsm
Thanks David and to everyone for sharing your insight. It is an exciting time for lung cancer patients, researchers, &amp; clinicians #lcsm
We need intelligent, multidisciplinary, patient centered lung cancer screening.  Not always easy, but we should rise to the challenge. #lcsm
Screening is how we are going to move the survival needle for lung cancer.  Let's get overall up 10-20% and stage I &gt; 90% 5 year. #lcsm
Oh to be young…the world is your oyster @LungCancerFaces
Video from @STS experts on challenges of lung cancer screening.
Let's work on a graphic to put out there for screening.  No one can beat this group from patient perspective. #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily Very true. Putting these curves into words is the real art.  Often difficult.  A "tool" would go a long way. #lcsm
T4.  NLST curves.  More cancers detected.  Less overall death from cancer. 
T4.  How about survival curves in ELCAP NEJM article.  Incredible survival! 
I get lots of questions about radiation.  We need better modeling and position statements.  @UCD_ChestHealth
T3.  We need to better educate everyone about radiation doses and risks.  Really very little with LDCT.  Much higher with PET. #lcsm
Exactly RT @JFreemanDaily: T3: Show patients the reduction in mortality screening can provide for people at high risk of #lungcancer. #lcsm
By presenting "positive" screens in multi-D conference, we can avoid high risk ones nodules slipping through @TimAllenMDJD @JFreemanDaily
Amazing pathologists and pathology tools!  @TimAllenMDJD @julianguitron #lcsm
@LungCancerFaces You may be surprised!  Even in a metropolitan area, we still see a lot of head shaking cases.  #lcsm
Very real issues MT @MarksPhone: 2 factors at play, 1 LC has image issues, overtest (e.g. PSA, Mamograms, etc.) getting much press #lcsm
Too small to biopsy is relative term now.  RT @julianguitron: 2 small to biopsy, 2 big to follow comfortably... #LCS #lcsm
T2.  Please don't let anyone do a diagnostic thoracotomy on you for a screen or CT detected nodule!!! Go minimally invasive. #lcsm
@UCD_ChestHealth T2.  Sounds pretty good to me when you think about how many millions of people eligible for screening!
T2.  False positives.  We have to take fear out of small nodules and avoid invasive w/u or excessive radiologic studies. #lcsm
T1. AATS, our thoracic surgical society, has online risk calculator to help patients and PCPs 
Guidelines from AATS @AATSHQ for screening 
Without doubt. RT @Gregmogel: T2:  false positive is the main issue to be addressed…especially in first round of screening. #lcsm
In future, will have to be in context of ACR approved programs. 
T1.  I believe strongly that selected older patients with good performance status should be offered screening. #lcsm
T1.  Somewhat different from mammo.  We are specifically screening a high risk population for a deadlier disease. #lcsm
T1.  We have to do better job educating PCPs about screening so they can educate patients.  Often a nihilistic view of #LungCancer #lcsm
T1.  Here is more about Lung-RADS 
T1.  Key for patients and PCPs to get reports with Lung-RADS descriptors and designated follow up.  Removes ambiguity #lcsm
T1 BUT…finding lung cancer early can be life saving.  New Lung-RADS should remove mystery 
T1 Patients should have probabilities explained in understandable method.  Few lung cancers are found and few nodules are #LungCancer.#lcsm
My dad was screened, but stopped after one year.  About 5 years later diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer.  What if? #lcsm
Let's take the fear out of screening for cancer. #lcsm
Hi everyone!  Thanks for organizing. Great to discuss screening &amp; early detection.  That &amp; prevention are best way to impact survival. #lcsm

@LungCancerFaces  #lcsm Better to see a surgeon…you get treatment, counseling, and a little love all at one price.  For 90 days!
Exactly RT @LungCancerFaces: Not just nodules, but emphysema and other serious lung disease shows up on CTs. Great reason to quit #lcsm
Agree.  But something (smoking stigma or therapeutic nihilism?) seems to turn them off @findlungcancer @LungCancerFaces  #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily  #lcsm Not very.  I have anecdotally found that a "detected" lung nodule is a good opportunity to discuss &amp; work on cessation
T2  Time commitment for these doctors with little reward for them.  Need to help them understand benefits.  @LungCancerFaces  #lcsm
T2.  Can't let counseling turn into beating patients up for smoking.  Cessation is important, but easier preached than done. #lcsm
T2.  Experience is important.  Not as much as getting the scan but in figuring out what to do with nodules.  LUNG-RADS should improve. #lcsm
T2  I'm not sure that "counseling" has even been validated.  Not a bad idea but wouldn't hang any hats on it for eligibility. #lcsm
T1.  Agree with @timallenMDJD.  False positives are a big issue. Have to be careful as risk of lung cancer gets lower. #lcsm
T1  Amazing how many people over 75 who we operate on successfully for early stage lung cancer.  How can they not be included? #lcsm
@UCD_ChestHealth  #lcsm Will send later tonight.  Interesting study showing mutational heterogeneity.
T1  Recent Science paper based upon mutation analysis suggested a 20 year latency after stopping smoking!  #lcsm
@PollywogPrinces  This is a good point.  Family history is sometimes difficult.  Would be great to fund studies for genetic markers #lcsm
T1 In general yes.  But evidence for benefit in screening longer and for screening patients &gt; 15 years from smoking cessation #lcsm

Thanks everyone.  Always great to hear from so many different invested parties.  I learn something every time. #lcsm
Great discussion. Take home for me: education, trial access, tissue testing, resource sharing, need fast access to basic trial info  #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily  #lcsm We are going to need simplified "cocktail menu" to keep all the immunotherapy trials straight.  And a cocktail.
T3.  With regard to trials, it is a balance between offering broad access and ensuring quality. #lcsm
T3.  Have to move patients to trial sites, but also involve community physicians.  #ASCO has generally done a good job with this. #lcsm
@JackWestMD  #lcsm But I have to believe molecular testing will educate us for future patients.  #Investment
@JackWestMD  #lcsm Not sure how you guys deal with all of that data with so little on the outcome side.  #MustBeTough
I agree.  RT @JFreemanDaily  #lcsm T2: Personally, I think all advanced #lungcancer patients should ask to have genomic panel done
T2.  How does group feel about broad mutation testing or sequencing for advanced stages? #lcsm
T2.  Should be standard. Also have low threshold for repeat tissue sampling.  Biopsy is generally safe.   #lcsm

@fgrazz Yes! Difficult to sort through noise.  We are working on methods to use each patient as own control to avoid being misled. #lcsm
@Rheummd @drjaneypeterson Very true.  Good reason to screen in specialty centers with specific f/u plans and algorithms.  Avoid excess w/u.
@JFreemanDaily Hard to use screening population for proof of concept studies as #LungCancer rate so low, leading to low PPV.  #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily Idea is to prospectively study individual patient's change in markers pre &amp; post.  Clean study in early stage disease. #lcsm
Majority of #LungCancer patients can be managed with careful radiographic f/u and liberal use of CT biopsy, avoiding unnecessary operation.
@WeillCornell, less than 5% of our lung operations are done on patients with suspicious lung nodules ultimately found to be benign.#lcsm
@drjaneypeterson Sounds great. Difficult to define total population but important to track "harm" in a carefully managed cohort.
My dad was screened for LungCA, but still died from it 5 years later.  Screening not perfect, but is our duty/chance to make better. #lcsm

@JFreemanDaily @lil_lytnin  #lcsm  And I hope your markers never move anywhere but down!
@JFreemanDaily  #lcsm Pre- and post-resection biomarker studies in early stage are also pretty convincing and not conceptually hard to do.
@JFreemanDaily  #lcsm T3 Big studies.  Have to piggyback on more CT screening or large scale surgical studies.
T3.   All of these biomarker research studies are critically dependent upon patients allowing biobanking of their specimens.  Thanks! #lcsm
T3.  We are working on proteomics, metabolomics, and genetic risks @WeillCornell #lcsm
T3.  "Biomarkers" aren't easy though in such a heterogenous disease.  Probably different markers for different lung cancers.   #lcsm
Along with biomarkers, have to also work to identify inherited risk genes to further define groups for screening.  Exciting stuff #lcsm
T3.  Unlikely that blood/breath biomarkers will be stand alone, but will likely be adjunct to imaging. #lcsm
T3.  Biomarker research is a great investment.  Will allow us to better risk stratify detected nodules. #lcsm
@LungCancerFaces @XRT4U @JackWestMD  #lcsm Totally agree with overblown anxiety.  Try the anxiety of actually having lung cancer.
@XRT4U @JackWestMD  #lcsm  This will be lessened with formal LungRad descriptors.  There is anxiety due to lack of education--MDs &amp; patients
@TomVargheseJr  #lcsm Be well!
@ElizBlanchardMD  #lcsm Agree.  Definitely need the PCPs to buy in.  They are the gatekeepers and know the patients the best.
@TomVargheseJr @JFreemanDaily  #lcsm Understatement…..
@LungCancerFaces  #lcsm Here is where it is nice to take it out of their hands and enroll patients in screening programs with dedicated f/u.
T2.  PCPs are sometimes nervous about having to deal with "positive" studies. Clear management algorithms will help.  #lcsm
T2.  Education, education, education.  And instilling a little fear about missing standard of care! #lcsm
T1.  Compared to other cancers, LungCA has an "under" diagnosis problem rather than "over" as reflected by survival rates for stage I #lcsm
T1  "Harm" previously reflects studies with undefined nodule management protocols &amp; high rates of thoracotomy vs VATS for nodules #lcsm
T1 We are trying to define "harm" in our patient population of people operated on for suspicious lung nodules ultimately benign #lcsm
@LungCancerFaces @LCAorg @BarackObama  #lcsm Operated on 87 yo "senior" with essentially screen detected cancer this week.  Great guy.
@JackWestMD  #lcsm T1  Agree.  But have to make sure all patients have access.  Tricky business.
T1.  LungRads will take some of the randomness out of management.  
T1.  May not be popular to say, but screening programs probably not for every hospital.  Programs need to be certified and audited.  #lcsm
T1. Main barrier seems to be fear of over diagnosis or unnecessary tests.  These problems can be minimized by smart multiD teams #lcsm
Agree with others.  We have to make a lot of noise.  But smart noise. #lcsm
T1.  Have to focus on the moving target of screening.  Easy for people to get hung up that it is not perfect.  Only getting better.   #lcsm

@dlschermd May be true when no absolute treatment plan in place. In surgery there is often built in discussion regarding risk/benefit.
@dlschermd All too often wrong people have conversation- No established relationship w/ patient.  And family/patient wishes may diverge.

@dwramzimdmph So "no".  Can't find anything from you re public health or epidemiology either.  You are, however, entitled to your opinion.
@dwramzimdmph @RichDuszak @AARP Not at all.  Have read, thought, researched, and written about lung cancer extensively.  You?
@dwramzimdmph @RichDuszak @AARP Any reasonable, well read person knows there is plenty of data on both sides.
@dwramzimdmph @RichDuszak @AARP  Of course we recognize the potential for harm.  But those of us with experience know it can be minimized.

@jimgthornton @RichDuszak  Effect looks small per 1000 women.  But if you screen the millions who are eligible, you save thousands of lives.
@jimgthornton @RichDuszak I say you pick one paper and I can pick another...
@jimgthornton Patient/MD education re risks/benefits, improved imaging, screening  auditing, malpractice protection way to move forward.
@jimgthornton Highly illogical argument and disrespectful to patients.
@jimgthornton @RichDuszak Fearmongering of "chopping off breast" for benign disease is irresponsible.  Where is data showing this?
@jimgthornton @RichDuszak Depends whether you consider negative biopsy "unnecessary treatment".  Many rational people don't.
Exactly.  "@DrGMcGinty: Wondering why @nytimes prefers a pediatrician talk about #mammography than a #radiologist? 
@jimgthornton @RichDuszak What is data for unnecessary mastectomy?  Maybe biopsies being done for benign, but "chopping off" seems dramatic.
@ShannonBrownlee And difficult to compare lung to breast and prostate given wide disparity in usual stage at diagnosis and overall survival.
@ShannonBrownlee But PPV higher and Bx rate lower.  Any data showing increased harm as imaging technology improves?
@ShannonBrownlee Don't know data. Suspect it has/will with technology/experience.  Any suggestion of increase? 
@dwramzimdmph @writeo @TomVargheseJr @findlungcancer A telephone survey?!  Trying my best to ignore you, but you continue to amuse.
@ShannonBrownlee "Harms" will decrease w/ standardized lung-RAD reporting &amp; accreditation of programs. Benefits will likely increase. #lcsm
@dwramzimdmph I looked you up. Although entitled to opinion, you have no credentials suggesting anyone should listen w/ regard to #lungCA.
@dwramzimdmph Lot of "bullies" b/t all those organizations in support. People who actually study and write about lung cancer and screening.
@dwramzimdmph @LungCancerFaces That shallowness and ignorance shows why you should not be commenting on this.  No desire to discuss further.
@dwramzimdmph @LungCancerFaces Also don't understand this.  Hope you are not suggesting I support screening because it increases my salary.
@dwramzimdmph @LungCancerFaces @kennylinafp And for the record, that would put you on the wrong side of history.  #lcsm
@dwramzimdmph @LungCancerFaces I don't understand question. Undoubtedly must scrutinize costs.  But historic to put this before lives saved.
@LungCancerFaces @dwramzimdmph @kennylinafp Cessation should be built into accredited screening programs.  It is a teachable moment.
@LungCancerFaces @dwramzimdmph @kennylinafp CMS can't withhold when USPSTF, NCCN, ASCO, ACS, AATS, ACCP, and ATS all recommend LC screening.
@LungCancerFaces @dwramzimdmph @aschwattie @kennylinafp The "not screen" argument won't hold for lung cancer.  CMS will support. Rightfully.
Amazing.  MT: Dr. Pomp from @nyphospital speaking at #DDW14: Bariatric surgery only 0.3% mortality rate, roughly = to hip replacement.
Rich &amp; Kevin Gates, my college housemates. As stubborn as ever. Going "open kimono" to avoid nonsensical prosecution. 
If over 75 years old may benefit from lungCA screening, why not 65-74 year olds? 
Surgeons and I-ELCAP team decreasing risk.  
@findlungcancer I heard naysayers came better prepared.  Screening proponents must address cost data &amp; absence of older patients in NLST.
@ByMudock @findlungcancer @LungCancerFaces Tough to beat, but if truly limited to inside one lung---maybe a chance.
MT:   We're not giving up on #lungcancer screening! #lcsm #MedCAC 
ACR's new Lung-RAD is a quality assurance tool that will standardize reports, reduce false + harm.

@UCD_ChestHealth @SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Big operation, but morbidity and complications decreasing significantly.
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Q8. Some favor chemo-radiation before surgery. I like it for squamous, but prefer chemo alone for adeno.
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Q8.  For T1-2N0, primary surgery ok.  I favor induction therapy before surgery for T2 or T3, even if N0
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Q8.  For any clinical nodal metastasis, should get induction therapy.  But get surgeon involved early.
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Q8.  Depends on stage.  Get multidisciplinary eval.  Dysplasia/early T1N0 may be managed endoscopically
@SalgiFoundation Q7 #EsophagealCancer Endoscopic biopsy.  If cancer need endoscopic ultrasound to determine depth and bx nodes, CT, and PET.

#EsophagealCancer @SalgiFoundation @LungCancerFaces Lots of innovative endoscopic techniques out there to prevent or treat early cancer.
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer EGD is a lot easier than colonoscopy.  (And less messy and far to go!). More of an effort to find early.
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Patients and physicians can't ignore heartburn or difficulty swallowing.  Low threshold for endoscopy.
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancer Barretts has to be diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy.  Need to r/o dysplasia and cancer.  Surveillance.
@SalgiFoundation @LungCancerFaces  #EsophagealCancer Wish we knew.  Some thought PPIs may even increase risk or mask symptoms.
#EsophagealCancer Important for people with GERD to be evaluated by GI doctors &amp; considered for endoscopy, particularly with persistent sxs
@SalgiFoundation  #EsophagealCancerQ3 Reflux leads to chronic inflammation and injury, which may initiate/promote cancer growth.
@UCD_ChestHealth @SalgiFoundation Barrett's is tricky.  Increases risk, but probably not to extent initially thought.  #EsophagealCancer

@InnovationCR @LungCancerFaces Outside funding critical for young investigators, innovative projects. Relentless application cycle tiring.
@ZGJR Surgeons should push technology. But there is danger in "I'll just look it up" mentality. Part of surgery is having this in your mind.
@LungCancerFaces @AlainaBCyr @AureliaCotta @JackWestMD @TomVargheseJr @julianguitron @TimAllenMDJD Impressed with multiple players in #lcsm
Is preop chemo better for lung cancer?  Article answers only part of question.  But appealing to  maximize rx early. 
I did a complex surgery today and did NOT need (or even have any DESIRE) to wear google glasses.  Thankfully. 
"OK Glass":Disrupt HC

@ZGJR @julianguitron Can I get a show of hands from those of you who don't want your surgeon surfing internet while performing your surgery?
@ClevelandClinic Why isn't esophageal cancer "preventable"?  Even easier to reach with a scope.  And not as messy.
@GeeTeeO @Docweighsin Not sure docs even have road map.  Effort to standardize &amp; communicate after dx made would decrease LOS.  #hcsm
@subatomicdoc Converse also true.  Community does a lot very well.  Need to identify what done best where and optimize patient flow.
@serendopeity EsophCA is a terrible thing.  Don't have to tell you. But congratulations for beating it and doing what you are doing.
@serendopeity Nasser Altorki is a master of esophageal surgery.  We've tried to replicate his en bloc operation with min invasive approach.
@serendopeity We favor MIE, but important to still do en bloc resection with extensive lymph node dissection.  Tough surgery, not = for all.
@serendopeity Tough question.  Thoracic approaches beat transhiatal for CA. After that depends on surgeon/center rather than open/MIE.
@subatomicdoc @BloombergView Dartmouth studies seem to ignore specialized treatment that prolongs life.  Only common chronic conditions.
@subatomicdoc @BloombergView Dartmouth studies only focus on last 2 years life and "assign" hospitals rather than use hard data.
@subatomicdoc @BloombergView Not really. Only 1st link appears to address your point.  Rest say that higher prices don't = better care.
Ellen must have gotten this advice tonight... 
@InnovationCR I can't compete with scientists in research &amp; most scientists can't compete w/ clinicians for lungCA knowledge.  Why compete?
@InnovationCR I am guilty too. But crazily, I have too often seen investigators reject human data because it differs from mouse data! WTF?!
@InnovationCR Agree, but too often becoming a rat race to publish one high impact paper after another with no clear path to clinic.
@InnovationCR Exactly. K-ras mutation + mice are being saved all over the country. How about K-ras + patients? Bring on Research Innovation.
Focus lungCA research funding on translational studies w/ clear, timely impact in patients. Lots of progress in science, less in patients.
Even smoking mice don't get real lung cancer.  Got to study people with lungCA to understand lungCA in people. #lcsm 
@CancerGeek @TomVargheseJr Happiness is the truth.

@PracticalWisdom @dlschermd  #lcsm Definitely tough.  Experience helps.  But we can't BE each of our patients. Helps to understand them
@TomVargheseJr  #lcsm Totally agree.  Stats don't reflect what patient's day-to-day life is like.
@ElizBlanchardMD   #lcsm And probably sometimes true.  I had my own dad treated in community, where he got excellent standard of care.
@JackWestMD   #lcsm Unfortunate.  Hopefully groups like this can help monitor and guide patients.
@CancerGeek  #lcsm Thanks for thoughts.
The next "greatest thing" is unfortunately rare for the individual patient...but have to keep looking and providing hope. #lcsm
I know an oncologist who feels like he loses patients because he is honest, while his peers always promise next "greatest thing".   #lcsm
Question for oncologists.  Are patients/families more likely to want treatment from physician who quotes better survival? #lcsm
You never want to take away hope.  I always say "just an estimate" of what is in fact a broad range. #lcsm
Easier for surgeons to share survival numbers as they are more optimistic.  Has to be tougher for those dealing with stage IV #lcsm

@dean_jenkins Agree with you fundamentally that part of science is being wrong &amp; proving it.  Funding/publishing that is hard part.
@dean_jenkins ie: reproducible experiments.  Should publish proof, not endless trawling.  Need more attention to data, not impact factor.
@ryanmpoe Totally agree.
@dean_jenkins Point to me would seem to be science should be led by reproducible experiments, free from bias. Seems like Economist got it.
@ryanmpoe Agree wholeheartedly.  But one person's scientific method is another's delay/caution.  Utopia, science is not.
@TheAlexKnapp The journal publishing and grants processes are not capable of proving the point.  My suspicion is that problem even worse.
From the Economist.  How much "science" is wrong?  #hcsm #lcsm #science 
Troubling trend of publishing incorrect, poorly reviewed science.  The Economist 
@findlungcancer Has been rush to adopt for marketing purposes in my opinion.  But I also see potential for advantages.  Depends on surgeon.
@findlungcancer Not sure it adds value compared to good VATS/thoracoscopic surgery.  Loss of tactile feedback also concerning.  And $$$!
@picardonhealth @anyaSIPA @lisazamosky Great points.  Makes our system seem overly complicated and full of needless hurdles.
@JTOonline Similar for us.  Important take home-bigger nodules have higher false positive.  Don't accept "-" result with "-" culture.  #lcsm
@theNCI Thanks for the update.  This disease can be solved.  No reason overall survival can't look more like colorectal CA.  #esophagealCA
@AmirGhaferi @TomVargheseJr @jdimick1 @mzenilman Hope people can truly understand the pleasure of using hands to make another human better.

@docdailey @RichDuszak @Bob_Wachter Not sure why would be-little overlap.  My take, more likely is issue with Murthy's political activism.
@RichDuszak @docdailey @Bob_Wachter @WeillCornell Without a doubt.  I know I am.  Shouldn't always be taken to imply lack of perspective.
@docdailey @Bob_Wachter @RichDuszak @WeillCornell Point taken but ? intent.  Acute care surgeon / intensivist similar issues as hospitalist.
@docdailey @Bob_Wachter @RichDuszak @WeillCornell Again,not really.  Only that hospitalists are insulated from some hot-button HC issues.
@Bob_Wachter @RichDuszak @WeillCornell Not exactly.  He simply pointed out challenges b/c of Murthy's inexperience in many areas.

@findlungcancer IYCO-in your correct opinion.  Once we get stage I survival over 90% we can start worrying about overdiagnosis. #lcsm
@findlungcancer @VentureBeat May not work for all tumors.  Also limited evidence showing treating most "targets" extends survival, esp #lcsm
@findlungcancer @VentureBeat Hopeful, but...most biopsies aren't risky or overly expensive.  This platform may still need biopsy to confirm.

@SDFatPhRMA  #lcsm Great idea.  Is there caucus for other cancers?
@CancerGeek  #lcsm Safe flight.
Funding/researcher interest is improving, led mostly by targeted therapies.  But often too late.  Need to push screening, early dz too #lcsm
T3.  Cost to society of lung CA is enormous.  Have to get that across on many different levels.  #lcsm
Will I be stigmatized if I can't keep up and type fast enough? #lcsm
@walleyhh   #lcsm  Not clear.  May be association with inflammatory lung disease which carries small increased risk of lung CA.
@louisianagirl91  #lcsm  I honestly don't think I realized it until I started treating lung CA patients.  Many MDs don't realize. Problem.
T2. Agree with these great points about studying "stigma" systematically.   Would be a powerful message, hard to refute. #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily   #lcsm I'm glad you don't!  Getting better and can even test and bank from needle biopsies now.  Biobanks also stigmatized.
@JFreemanDaily @CancerGeek  #lcsm I'll put in plug for biobanks here.  Critical to "share" tissue so we can figure out disease/erase stigma
T2. Saw a beautiful, happy lung CA patient this week who my own ICU team wanted to withdrawal on after she got reintubated.  Foolish. #lcsm
T2 And why can't older people with lung cancer at least be considered for standard of care? In many places they are not. #lcsm
T2 Can't let docs wait to diagnose or treat lung nodules in heavy smokers. Makes me crazy.  #lcsm

@findlungcancer I like the more emphatic version.....
@JTOonline Every cancer cell targeted therapy seems to eventually fail.  Have to put more effort/research in co-targeting microenvironment.

Radial margins and total lymph node counts during esophagectomy are important quality metrics, likely enhance survival.  #EsophagealCancer
Transhiatal esophagectomy.  Imagine Temple of Doom scene: pulling out esophagus instead of heart.  Not exactly great cancer operation.
Your surgeon sees you naked.  Not just physically, but  mentally &amp; emotionally.  It can be a lot to handle for both parties.

@LungCancerFaces @lil_lytnin Steps to dx/treat lungCA so routine for many docs, they forget incredible impact on individual patient.  #lcsm
Yesterday, I saw a vibrant 84 yo lady w/ a lung cancer that I'm going to take out.  Don't let age alone impede curative therapy.  #lcsm
@lil_lytnin If delay for test, ask if it can be scheduled somewhere else.  Part urban myth that all the workup has to be done at same place.
@lil_lytnin Start by asking.  Most docs can adjust schedule and will.  And don't wait for results of 1 test to schedule another.
@Trish_SupportLC Terrible feeling.  Nothing you can do but LIVE LIFE though and be smart.  Got to put more research $ into inheritable risk.

We've written about radiation exposure in lung CA patients.  
@JackWestMD @LungCancerFaces Great chat.  Thanks for taking the lead and for all of your work.
@LungCancerFaces Minimally invasive surgeons can do maximal operations and open surgeons can do minimal operations.  Choose wisely.
@findlungcancer @JackWestMD Very reasonable to consider.  Pretreatment staging is key.
@JackWestMD @subatomicdoc @findlungcancer Very reasonable.  But don't forget resection if safe and more tissue might guide future therapy.
@JackWestMD @1111linno 
@JackWestMD @1111linno Agree, but..We've done 3 window trials w/o increased adverse events and comparable OS.  That was unselected patients.
Will enable better understanding of drugs before develop multiple resistance mechanisms.  Have to be safe and not hurt curable pts #lcsm
Love idea of "window of opportunity" trials to treat with targeted drugs prior to surgery to assess biological end points  #lcsm
@ElizBlanchardMD recent trial showed no advantage to routine use with limited resection but may help if very close #lcsm
Need to introduce immunotherapy trials in earlier stage tumors. #lcsm
@JackWestMD Or SBRT may allow escape and dissemination of partially treated cells.  Need more studies in both RT and surgery regarding #lcsm
t2. Multidisciplinary guided rx with full staging regardless of treatment approach.   #lcsm

@CancerGeek Agre!  If a doctor can't see you to wrk rip a potential cancer within one wek, find another one to get started. #lcsm
t1. Lesser resection should preferably be segmentectomy vs wedge and should include node dissection #lcsm

Med school/residency have gotten easier, more humane, and more democratic.  But are we still instilling self discipline?  Great MDs need it.
In reading the lives of great men (or women), I found that the first victory they won was over themselves..self discipline -Harry S. Truman
Saw an ALL TIME fav patient.  Young wo w/ 3 young kids s/p VATS bilobectomy. Clear CT scan &amp; booming breath sounds.  Why I do it! #lcsm
@LungCancerFaces @DanRazMD @ScottReznik Definitely up for it.  Brutal disease. @SalgiFoundation @serendopeity #esocsm
@medschooladvice Alternatively...Surgeons---"they can do all because they think they can" (Virgil). #surgery #surgeon #hcsm
@TomVargheseJr @rvaughnmd One reason I love being a surgeon...get to work standing up! 
Dr. Francis Peabody (1925): “the secret of care for the patient is in caring for the patient”.  Every patient is personal. #lcsm #hcsm
@Docweighsin Are work hour restrictions for residents Patient-Centered Care?  Debatable, but I worry that "shift workers" lose connections..
@UCD_ChestHealth Often leads to remarkable transparency. Great endeavor by CT surgeons.  Public reporting = better outcomes. #PTSafety.
@ShoaClarke No more true than w/ regard to basic research.  Humbling field. Too many studies rushed to publish but difficult to reproduce.
Last tweet came out b/c I'm fired up my son was awarded "student of year" at NY jiu jitsu!  
Rectitude, courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, loyalty--7 virtues of bushido should be mandatory for surgeons/doctors too. #hcsm
@PreMedTweets @medschooladvice @MedschoolQueen Science important but 90% of being a good doctor is knowing how to understand people.
@LungCancerFaces @JackWestMD Too much good data.  Let's see survival for stage I break 90% before we concern ourselves with overdiagnosis.
@LungCancerFaces @JackWestMDd Great commentary.  Screening yields high false positives that may be challenge for FPs to manage.  Need team.
Lesson of day:  One individual's survival against cancer can't be measured by a curve on a piece of paper.  
Thought for day: Measure twice, cut once--For carpenters, tailors, surgeons, and those of you metaphorically cutting.  #lcsm #esocsm
@findlungcancer @TomVargheseJr @UCD_ChestHealth I can't make it---but watch for NYP-WCMC's featured JMC paper on surgery vs. SBRT!  #lcsm
Good to see my UVA Cavs whipped my twin bro's 'Heels!  Hope those Carolina guys at least went to class.  #GoHoos
@DocRockne @CostsofCare Don't see why you disagree.  Awareness=education.   Can do everything you say and still cut system costs.
@DocRockne @CostsofCare I have bills/debt.  Strongly believe I should be paid what market allows.  No excuse to not decrease system costs.
@CostsofCare  Thanks for the follow.  Most doctors aren't greedy-just need to be better educated about costs.  Particularly hospital costs.
@marksalke thanks for the comments. Have a great day!
@marksalke Better.  But so much about being a doctor, diagnostic and therapeutic, is based on human touch. #hcsm
Lesson of the day:  Tough to be a good doctor by telephone. #hcsm
Not sure what I got out of first 2 years med school.  Wasted a lot of it. But if could go back now, would make me better.  Why disconnect?
@MedschoolQueen Systems good.  Normal and pathological together?  (Definition of surgeon). Shorten basic science or spread into later years?
@MedschoolQueen How would you / fellow med students change med school?  Perfect curriculum?  Redoing our own at WCMC.  Need some input.
@JFreemanDaily @LiquidMagmaa @Trish_SupportLC @ahmed_rawat Thanks for the follow.  Science geeks, advocates, fighters, inspirations.
@Trish_SupportLC @LungCancerFaces @karenwhite1973 I'm gonna knock out some cancers for you guys and your memories! 
@LungCancerFaces @karenwhite1973 Sorry for you both. Lost my dad too.  Perfect pulm function/negative screening 5 years prior. Still miss.
Final lesson:  Sit down with patient on rounds.  Adjusts patient calculation of time spent 2-3x and makes them feel human in inhuman place.
Life lesson:  For balance, perspective, optimism...read to your child's (or any) preschool class.  Highlight of my day today.
Rounds/ward lesson #2:  Teenage patients are scared out of their wits.  Reassure them and give them something to smile about.
Rounds/wards lesson:  Don't trust a resident who is not nice to support staff.  Even if he/she is tired.
ICU lesson:  Check all lines, tubes, dressings, yourself.  Takes about 60 seconds and will prevent problems.  #icu
Lots of lessons today.  Clinic lesson--Unilateral wheezing in smoker is not COPD/asthma, but central tumor.  CXR can miss. #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily Dedicated units with educated staff are the key to making work.  #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily Sorry late.  Have to educate docs/nurse/support staff that palliative care doesn't mean "no care" or "ignore patient".
@LungCancerFaces Sorry late.  From surgeon's perspective, palliative care patients too often labeled hopeless, given up on by staff.
@julianguitron @LungCancerFaces Always!  Remarkably, less than 1/3 lungCA resections done by thoracic surgeons 
@LungCancerFaces Live tweet lungCA surgery=amazing for sure.  But lot of people/logistics to organize.  Good to start thinking about. #lcsm
Saw an old patient of David Skinner's today.  A true legend in esophageal surgery and health care networks! #NYP 
Great curriculum reform at WCMC.  Premed and med students---what would you change about med school?  #ChangeMedEd #medschool #premed
@SalgiFoundation @AmerGastroAssn Critical question!  Key area to focus research.  #EsophagealCancer
True "breakthroughs" require more efforts towards prevention/screening for early tumors.  Late NSCLC too smart even for targeted rx.  #lcsm

@LungCancerFaces Sorry.  In previous tweet. 
Very imp JTO paper.  SBRT stage I NSCLC.  3 yr DFS only 58% for SBRT if PET SUV&gt;2.47!  And only 59% of patients even had bx proven CA! #lcsm
It is not flesh and blood, but heart which makes us fathers and sons--Schiller. From "The Goldfinch" #family #author #quote
@JFreemanDaily  Thank you.  Let us know if you find anything revealing.  Interesting to systematically research "stigma".  #lcsm
#WCMCMeyerCancerCenter Enabling transformative, translational research that respects &amp; cares about the individual patient.  We're off! #lcsm
For recent patient.  Who would win mental battle b/t surgeon (largely infexible) and psychiatrist (mental gymnast)? #lcsm #psychology
@GrijalvaJusan @nyphospital NYP is like Musashi said about Mt. Fuji (with nod to you)--a broad and solid foundation 
@NewYorkObserver Thanks for following and for sacred truth.  “The truth is rarely pure and never simple.”  ― Oscar Wilde #NewYorkCity
@sundance_kid13 @nyphospital Thanks for the compliment to NYP!  Hope all goes well.  We are blessed with amazing staff and doctors.
Reading "Wonder" with son.  Thought provoking.  Could substitute "cancer patient" for Auggie. We could all use his grit #cancer #lcsm
@JFreemanDaily @LungCancerFaces Tough to find "facts" about stigma.  Here is a review of published studies #lcsm 
@TripCancer We've been saying this for a long time at NYPH/WCMC!  Thanks for spreading the word.  More nodes removed=better survival #esocsm
Good day.  Few things are as satisfying or enriching as removing a cancer from another human being.  Thanks to NYPH/WCMC team.  #LCSM
Great drug primer---not easy to make a good drug.  Disease is the enemy, not pharma.  
Let's make cancer drop like heart disease and stroke.  Prevention, screening,and better drugs. Declining Lethality 
"Hammer and chisel to crack.. sternum"!!! Dr. W.V. Cordice Jr., 94, a Surgeon Who Helped Save Dr. King, Dies 
@cnnhealth @OtisBrawley Harms can likely be minimized by rigorous protocols to determine reimaging/biopsy/surgery and by team evaluation.
@GeriatricPsych Enjoy and good luck on the grant!
@GeriatricPsych I'm speaking from some experience.  Faculty council at WCMC / husband of PhD/MBA/woman mentor/super mom pharma exec wife.
@GeriatricPsych Maybe.  
@GeriatricPsych  Still lose US MD women to conflict between home life/career.  In business, numerous examples/programs aimed at balance.
@JFreemanDaily @findlungcancer Agree!  Have to overcome barriers to trial entry and enroll populations that reflect the current demographic.
@LungCancerFaces Sorry to have missed an important chat.  In 2014--screening/early evaluation, team approach, standardized care for all.
Controversial article -
@Faisal_AHR If so, this will be a great loss to society.  No matter how good interventionalists get, we will always need cardiac surgeons.
#surgery predicts. Minimally invasive dominates, limited resection preferable to radiation for high risk lung cancer, focus on care pathways
@TomVargheseJr @STS_CTsurgery minimally invasive dominates, limited resection as alternative to lobectomy for nsclc, focus on care pathways
I have seen good compressions save numerous lives. Don't hesitate if any doubt.  How CPR Can Save a Life 
Teach kids to say thanks and appreciate what they have this holiday season.  Research supports it! Thanks!  
??? the same for chest surgery---A New Study Just Found The One Big Problem With Robot Surgeries 
He was high risk and should have been screened LONGER.  NLST likely underestimates mortality benefit!   #lcsm
Last thought.  Lost my dad to lung cancer, 5 years after negative CT screening. My interpretation isn't that screening didn't work. #lcsm
Have to log out.  Sorry to leave early.  Enjoyed the chat and will review later.  Important topic--thanks for bringing it up. #lcsm
Round, pure ground glass, &lt; 8mm, no growth on interval scan, multiple nodules ---- but always need to get group input. @JFreemanDaily  #lcsm
T2  Can't make broad statements about what should and shouldn't be biopsied.  Depends on appearance, location, and risk factors. #lcsm
In high risk patients yes.  Survival is not &gt;90% for stage I like other cancers.  If high suspicion--act. @LungCancerFaces  #lcsm
T1 PET has no place in screening paradigms.  Higher radiation and adds little to diagnosis for small nodules. #lcsm
T1  Need extensive clinician education about what is positive and standards for further workup in order to minimize excessive cost #lcsm
Respectfully disagree as does the NLST @ChrisCarrollMD R #lcsm
T1 No data to support that by the way.  Surely not beneficial on societal level.  But might save some individuals. #lcsm
T1  Difficult call.  Could consider if any family history, particularly when combined with any smoking history or other cancer history #lcsm
It is a numerical argument that equates increased cancer detection with overdiagnosis.  Doesn't prove indolence. @JFreemanDaily  #lcsm
Hope to hear what you are thinking too! @findlungcancer  #lcsm
Brendon Stiles, thoracic surgeon at New York-Presbyterian in NYC.  Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts. #lcsm
@LungCancerFaces Preview of "the good"---Screening saves lives.
Are Today's New Surgeons Unprepared? 
Do work hours restrictions hurt education?  They certainly decrease "experience"
@jay4man We will always be barbarians.  Just different battles to fight as we grow older.  Proud to be followed by such a big celebrity!
@dianneb4 Still think about you.  Your book is on my shelf.  And I see fabulous pictures from time to time.  Keep inspiring!
@ronshields You taught me everything I know.  About some things.  Thanks.
Thanks to @DrRichardBesser and @nyphospital for the opportunity be a part of #abcDrBchat and talk about #LungCancer.  Great conversation!
@CSHLnews @abcDrBchat Dr. Sordella is an expert on EGFR-based therapy/resistance.  A great opportunity to learn about cutting edge research.
@LungCancerFaces Agree!  And don't forget the PhDs.  We need them in the conversation just as much to translate from bench to bedside.
Join me (@nyphospital) and @DrRichardBesser of @abcnews for the #abcDrBchat on #LungCancer tomorrow at 1 PM EST
