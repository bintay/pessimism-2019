LINCOLN CAMPBELL 
@ShieldAgentP yep, that was the article that got me thinking about Coulson. Though it's pretty much a crack theory hahaha
22 Times Hayley Atwell Stole Your Heart 
&lt;3 
@Zoroark3496 lol because Ward's never done anything wrong in his life. Look, I hate the guy's guts, so let's drop this convo here, okay.
@Zoroark3496 she deserves getting tortured with needles? Wow.
@Zoroark3496 Ward deserves whatever shit he gets. Period.
But good luck coming back from this, because fandom will never forgive Ward if he hurts Mockingbird.
LOL

I'm so not surprised by this.
@nymehria seee, era una serie excelente y daba para varias temporadas más. Nos re cagaron.
@nymehria nope, lo que quiere el fandom es que saquen la season en DVD/bluray, porque como fue cancelada, ni eso les dieron.
@nymehria es solo una temporada, tho. Terminó en mayo del año pasado :(
@nymehria YEEEEEEEEEEES (si te gusta Lincoln, tenés que ver The Tomorrow People. John es muy similar).
Look at these two cuties. 
That awkward moment when it's 6:30 in the morning and you're rambling about alien DNA.
I mean, the change is triggered by a genetic marker, but who knows, maybe Coulson's DNA was altered by the Kree blood.
Though I have always wondered what would happen if the mist hit him, since he /does/ have Kree blood in his system.
hahahaha oh boy, would THAT fuck up everything and everyone
okAY but liSTEN: Inhumans vs SHIELD war, Coulson gets accidentally hit by a terrigen crystal and instead of dying, he transfORMS
"How about Green Arrow?"
"Lame."

Oh, shush you.

@Saviour_Queen sleep is good, you'll feel better in the morning. And f you don't, you have four months to process it :)
Making dinner at 2 in the morning and then watching Netflix until I pass out, just another Sunday night.
@Saviour_Queen hasn't ended yet. She'll get her happy ending, but at the /end/, so don't give up hope just yet.
@Saviour_Queen and I understand completely, but you have to keep in mind that ouat's getting another season, which means Regina's story
@Saviour_Queen just because sometimes things don't work out for them, it doesn't mean they won't work out for /us/ :)
@Saviour_Queen ugh, I know. Just... don't let a tv show make you believe that life works the same way, okay?
@Saviour_Queen *sends you a lot of virtual hugs*
I just wanted to know when Thea's birthday was, not the entire plot of every fuckgn episode jesus chrsit
tfw you stayed spoiler free for two years but then go on wikia to look up a name and the entry spoils you the enTIRE GOD DAMN SHOW.
@Zoroark3496 the last one, with the guy running around the place in his underwear hahaha
@Zoroark3496 what the hell did I just watch omg
That's not showing happiness for Skye bc she finally reunited with her long lost family. That's just being a selfish jerk. Bye.
She basically told Skye she hoped Jiaying didn't end up being a disappointment.
"she still took a moment to tell skye how happy she is that she found her mother."

No, she did not?!
I'M FINE 
AND WHEN SKYE FINALLY DID 
Tries v hard to not make a comment about how long Jiaying waited &amp; dreamed with the day her daughter would call her mom for the first time.
@nymehria para qué estan los amigos si no para deprimirse los unos a los otros con fanmixes/gifsets tristes :P
RUDE AF 
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria selective trusting (?) :P

QUEEN SIBLINGS
Thea and Oliver's relationship is my absolute favorite thing about this show.
@Saviour_Queen awesome, then it'll be faster to catch up :P I'm stocking up for hiatus season hahaha
@Saviour_Queen how many seasons are there? Just one?
@Saviour_Queen (and I say that with the utmost love)
@Saviour_Queen that one is also on my list and LOL nothing will ever be as nerve wracking as aos xD that show is THE WORST
@Saviour_Queen it's basically like any other superhero show, but still entertaining :P
@Saviour_Queen yep! I started it last night because I was bored and it's been on my to watch list for months xD
I respect Laurel, but I honestly do not like her. There's /something/ about her that irks me.
OLLIE YOU LITTLE SHIT
@Saviour_Queen she would be the perfect liaison between SHIELD and the Inhumans, both parties would trust her. :')
Four episodes in and I already love Thea. My sweet summer child, I shall adopt you and protect you.
@Saviour_Queen wasn't Skye supposed to be in charge of that one day? xD Like Coulson told her in Repairs.
@Saviour_Queen then yes, if not, then leave them alone.
@Saviour_Queen I think the Index thing could be a good idea? BUT!!! It should be voluntary. If they want to be indexed,
I'm watching Arrow 1x04 "An Innocent Man" 
@Saviour_Queen Lincoln get hurt because of it.
@Saviour_Queen I don't agree with her choice tbh, but I understand why she made it. I just hope neither she or Skye or
@Kenzmalikov omg ni se me habia ocurrido el paralelo tho??? Pero holy shIT /sad forever
@Saviour_Queen even if she hates SHIELD, she wouldn't have hurt Coulson because he actually cared and protected Skye.
@Saviour_Queen and let's not forget it was Gonzales the one who sent that team to kill Skye, and Jiaying knows that.
SHIELD's mistake was to send in Gonzales instead of Coulson. Jiaying would've never killed him because she knows how much he means to Skye.
Remember when I said Skye was going to ask Jiaying to give Coulson a chance, and SHE DID.

I love being right.
@Kenzmalikov FML FML FML FML FML FML FML FML
@Saviour_Queen hahaha you're team Inhumans like me xD honestly, none of this would've happened had /Coulson/ talked to Jiaying
@Saviour_Queen SAME. I just have this nagging feeling that she /belongs/ there. At the very least, let her spend more time with them.
This fucked me up. 
@Saviour_Queen I know *sigh* sadly, I don't think that can be avoided :/ I have a feeling that she's gonna be forced to choose
@Saviour_Queen idk maybe I'm being too hopeful, but I think she's going to be okay :) or as okay as you can be in aos xD
@Saviour_Queen and they also had a 3 month hiatus in between A and B like aos.
@Saviour_Queen I think the 2 hour thing has more to do with the schedule than with the plot? Because ouat also has a 2 hour finale
@Kenzmalikov yo a veces reblogueo edits asi en el blog de Skye, y sé que se ven bien. O al menos no TAN borrosas como los gifs.
@Saviour_Queen yep, that's what I was thinking too. They haven't even released the stills from ep 22 yet :||| it's freaking me out lol
@Kenzmalikov de todas formas, los graphics así no se ven mal en el blog? El tema son los gifsets.
@Kenzmalikov WHY IS THIS MADE WITH THE NEW DIMENSIONS W H Y 
@Saviour_Queen yay! :D I figured, since you spend more time on here than on tumblr. Though news have been p slow this week? Kinda weird.
Annie googles when is ABC going to release the stills from episode 22 bc we're running out of time here
@Saviour_Queen if it helps, the blog has a twitter, too? @fyskye I tweet/RT everything that gets posted on the blog
@Saviour_Queen I don't follow anyone either, so if it wasn't because I /have/ to know stuff bc of my blog, I would be so out of the loop.
@Saviour_Queen doesn't mean you love them any less. :)
@Saviour_Queen if that makes you a bad Skye fan, then I'm a terrible Emma fan. Just because you don't talk about them 24/7
@afoley24 will we ever see Skye's plaid shirts make a return? I'm loving her new shirts, but I must admit I really miss the old ones. :)
I'm currently kind of very super obsessed with RAIGN's cover of Knockin' on Heaven's Door.
Whatever you do, do not think about Natasha mentoring Wanda, teaching her to be an Avenger and becoming Wanda's surrogate big sister.

What a strange feeling.
This is the first time in like forever that I'm more interested in the male character than in any of the female ones.

What if I start Arrow.

WHAT IF.
@Kenzmalikov AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING MWAHAHAHAAH
@Saviour_Queen perfecto :) oooh, so she's a native speaker! You're lucky, those professors are the best.
@Zoroark3496 I need to keep that in mind. Meh, some people I used to be friends with, not worth your or my time.
@Zoroark3496 good point, letting aos consume my entire life was a mistake
I'm not kidding, I already have like 5 more gifsets with song lyrics planned.
aos destroyed my creativity and murdered my muse, but Clarke Griffin brought it back from the dead.
@Saviour_Queen that's great! Where's your teacher from?
"#clarkle sparkle" omg
Chloe, you big dork, what the fuck are you doing.
@Saviour_Queen that's awesome! :D You got 100% on everything so far!
@Saviour_Queen just pls don't die xD
@Saviour_Queen here, so you can practice your spanish :P 
This twitter is pro Jiaying and anti Ward, and if any of that makes you uncomfortable (lmfao) please go away.
@Kenzmalikov that's why I unfollowed her like two months ago lmao bye
When the actress understands her character better than 99% of the fandom. Thank you, Dichen. 
@Kenzmalikov but she never unfollowed them or stopped talking to them??? So ???? Yeah, I unfollowed her for that reason too.
@Kenzmalikov she sent me a shit ton of DMs saying I was a "hero" for standing up to them, and talking about how HORRIBLE they were
I guess it's easier to shit talk people via DM instead of doing it publicly.
You came to me screaming bloody murder about what these people were doing to me, and yet you remained friends with them.
When people you used to be friends with, turn out to be complete and utter trash. *smh*
So the only one left who hasn't tried to kill Ward is Coulson. Interesting.
Get in line, Hunter. 
@the_anna_15 and she's gone through hell. She has her reasons for doing what she does.
@the_anna_15 I think it's okay to disagree with her choices, but hating her is absurd. She loves Skye, she loves her people
@the_anna_15 exactly, to all of them the end justifies the means
@the_anna_15 she's trying to protect her people, and given SHIELD's history with Inhumans, I don't blame her for being scared
@the_anna_15 um, hello, I've stan her since day one and that hasn't changed.
*salutes* 
If you have to shit on another character to defend yours, then you can shove your meta up where the sun don't shine.
Your meta was so good until you went and shitted on Jiaying just so you could put May on a pedestal. 

Nope. Bye.
I reached the 5k follower mark on Tumblr. Holyf cuk?! 
idk man I think Skye belongs with the Inhumans, that's where she's always supposed to be.
Oh, god. 
You know what, I hope you get what you want. And I hope it goes the same way it did in the comics, maybe that'll teach you a lesson.
It's an insult to the characters you so claim to love that you're incapable of believing they can have development outside a romantic ship.
Why do you have to make everything about ships. It's like the characters are worthless unless they're involved with eachother.
@Kenzmalikov *SWOON* JAJAJAJJAJAJJAJADAHDAJGHDGAAD
I'm trash and I ship this like /a lot/. 
RIP my dreams of getting an Inhumans spinoff.
/SCREAMS/ 
Here's to another year of getting emotionally destroyed by Agents of SHIELD.

CHEERS, FRIENDS! &lt;3
I LEFT FOR FORTY MINUTES AND THE NEWS CAME OUT

GDI ABC
@Kenzmalikov sabía qué gif era antes de hacer clic en el link xD
gdi ABC I don't care about the new series pickups, I want the /renewed/ series list.
@nymehria estaba esperando que dijeras Skye y Jaying, porque esa canción idk why me sonó mucho a ellas :3 *espera (im)pacientemente*
@nymehria mixes de qué?!?!?!?! :DDDD
@nymehria che, tenias pensado algún gifset con esta canción?
@nymehria nono, es un buen ouch! :P
@nymehria ouch
They want her to be happy but on THEIR terms. Just how fucking selfish are you, really.
Skye finally made a good friend, and people hate him because he's "in the way" of skyeward.

??¡¡¡???
Skye finally found her mom and people hate her because no, May is her mom ¡?????
This fandom whines about how Skye never gets to be happy, but when she IS, they hate it.
#teamInhumans
@Kenzmalikov I WILL BRING THE MATCHES
SLAY HOPE SLAY 
@nymehria OMHFHDALJKHFAKJAHK QUIERO
@nymehria omfg NO HABIA VISTO ESTE TWEET PERO YESSSS
I'M IN 
@nymehria KILL IT WITH FIRE
I vote for the Inhumans to burn SHIELD to the ground. Not even sorry.
*minute 32*
Jiaying: my people would never blindly follow me into a war
*minute 42*
Jiaying: THIS IS WAR

me: what just happened
"The next terrible thing that he does, is on me."

Cue to Ward and Kara kidnapping Bobbi who saved Jemma's life. lol??????
OKAY BUT LOOK AT JIAYING'S TINY SMILE WHEN SKYE CALLS HER MOM. 
Does this woman even FEEL anything.
"I never lost control."
"Skye is living proof that you did."

I mean, excuse me? He should've done what exactly, let her die?
Well, I don't wanna say "a bitch" but that's exactly what I wanna say.
What the frick even happened to May this season. She had made so much progress during season one and now she's back to being...
I will see myself to the dumpster now.
I'm laughcrying because when Jiaying said "to FRActure" I swear I heard Anya. She used the same tone.
Ah yes, let's rewatch Scars. I have some gifsets to make.

"Chloe’s become a helluva action hero. If you give her something, she'll learn it."

@Kenzmalikov WHY CANT WE HAVE NICE THINGS LIKE ANYA ENSEÑANDOLE A CLARKE A PELEAR, CAGANDOSE DE RISA CADA VEZ QUE LA OTRA SE CAE EN EL BARRO
"So Dichen Lachman really likes starting war, huh?!"

*SNORTS*
@Kenzmalikov LLORA CONMIGO 
Kara could be such an amazing addition to the team, and instead, she's being reduced to... whatever this is.
what a woNDERFUL and inTEREsTING pLOT!!!!!
And because Ward is oh, so helpful, instead of making her understand, he's enabling her in her seek for revenge.
The SHIELD agent that was undercover at Hydra, that could've saved her but instead let her get tortured and brainwashed.
So Kara blames Bobbi for being brainwashed, is that it? That's why she was asking Jemma about her.
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria hmm para mi esto tiene que ver con Kara, no tanto con Coulson
@Kenzmalikov está ayudando a Kara a vengarse de Bobbi por algo, pero no sé qué??? No entiendo tampoco cuál es su juego.
@Kenzmalikov same, encima que su arc no tiene conexión con el resto, tampoco me importa?? Por mi que se vaya.
@Kenzmalikov todos pensando que había hecho algo bueno por Kara y nah, era todo un plan calculado. Éste no cambia más.
@Saviour_Queen it took me three days to realize this, that's how much attention I payed to that scene. But yeah, he's a lost cause.
Redemption arc my ass.
HIS FANS SPENT A WEEK USING THAT CONVO TO PROVE HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS AND HE WAS FUCKING LYING.
He was bullshitting Coulson so he wouldn't doubt Kara and allowed her to stay lmao
It just occurred to me that the phone conversation Ward had with Coulson was all a lie. It was all part of the plan to kidnap Bobbi.
Thank you @ Rothenberg for changing everything. Your show &gt;&gt;&gt; the book.
Oh god, I'd much rather read bellarke. But not this, never this.
That awkward moment when Wells and Clarke are a thing in the book and you're like <FEARFUL FACE>
"Maybe there are no good guys."
Sounds familiar, doesn't it.
"I do care, but I made this choice with my head and not my heart. The duty to protect my people comes first."
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC AND ROYALTY BYE
WATCH ALL THE SEASONS, CRY ALL THE TEARS AND SUFFER ALL THE PAIN OR GTFO.
tfw when you're irrationally possessive over your favorite character/ship and you're like NO YOU DO NOT TOUCH THAT. IT'S MINE.

@Kenzmalikov a mi tampoco, porque a Octavia la mando derecho de una patada a gryffindor xD y Bellamy ps... same que Clarke
@Kenzmalikov Maya era hufflepuff xD y quizás Monty?
@Kenzmalikov exacto! pero jamás nunca never ever hufflepuff :||||||
@Kenzmalikov de hecho, me tiraria mas a slytherin? es del tipo capaz de matar por los que quiere, mientras que gryffindor es más morir por

@Kenzmalikov esta muy, muy bien hecho &lt;333
@Kenzmalikov :') 
"Don't hate female characters for things that you love male characters for." Just saying.
"I'm really starting to hate Jiaying." And yet you stan Ward. The hypocrisy would be hilarious if it wasn't so gross.
@Zoroark3496 the entire team of writers of aos?
@Kenzmalikov :(
@Kenzmalikov I'm sad :(
DON'T look at this and DON'T think about Jiaying being prisoner of Whitehall. 
I will get back to everyone when I can, just not today.
I'm purposely ignoring everyone's asks because I honestly just cannot deal with this today. I'm sorry.
me: hoe don't do it

tumblr: *adds new stupid, useless, annoying af feature*

me: ohmgyOD *installs another script*
Dichen Lachman is everything, and I want to keep her forever.
@Kenzmalikov YASSSS!!! Me estaba preguntando cuándo lo anunciarán, porque nos quedan solo 5 eps nomás xD
"People are not, generally speaking as a group, we're not tolerant. We're not compassionate enough as people."
"Well, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. She really believes she's doing the right thing to protect her people."
Like, yes, she wants to protect her daughter but yes, she wants to protect her people.
So what I'm getting from this is that not even Dichen knows what's /really/ up with Jiaying.
Good lord, Dichen's accent is a thing of beauty.
And you thought Skye's dad was evil! #AgentsofSHIELD 

'Misunderstood' is what …
"His hygiene is certainly questionable, but he does love his daughter."

Oh, Kyle.

300% DONE 
@Saviour_Queen agreed. They will either stay this way, or find new ones. But their families are NOT something they have in common.
@Saviour_Queen they're just so desperate to find connections between Skye and Ward, it's pathetic. Everything Skye does MUST be about Ward!!
@nymehria nah, no es algo que haces vos, es la porqueria de tumblr :))) hay gifs que tuve que intentar 4 veces hasta que los subió
@Saviour_Queen Garrett treated Ward like dirt. Jiaying calls her daughter by the name SKYE chose because she respects her. Totes twinsies!
@Saviour_Queen yeah, at this point it's like pls stop, I'm getting second hand embarrassment here
@nymehria a mi me tira error todo el tiempo. Proba subir de a uno, y si te da error, insistí. Eso hago yo :/
Because last time I checked, Garrett loved to beat the living shit out of Ward whenever he felt like it.
If you're comparing Skye's relationship with the Inhumans with Garrett/Ward, then you're a fucking idiot.

@Kenzmalikov eso parece?? Dice "una nueva serie de SyFy" so...????
Books like these hardly ever get published where I live, so yes I'M EXCITED TO HAVE FOUND IT.
LOOK WHAT I JUST GOT 
@Zoroark3496 my bet's still on Mike and/or one of the Inhumans (Lincoln, Jiaying and/or Gordon).
@Zoroark3496 I don't think that's going to happen, at least not for a long time. Anyone else is fair game, though.
@Zoroark3496 I understand, which is also why I didn't lament it. Change's never bothered me.
In other news, Quake is in third place in Marvel's Hero of the Month poll. So, vote for her?

"Damn that girl is making me dizzy. Those eyes. Those lips. Get her outta your head, Clarke!"

ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME
I BEAR IT SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO. CONCEAL DON'T FEEL DO NOT CRY
Whatever you do, do not think about Clarke alone in the woods, sitting by the fire, drowning in guilt but still not allowing herself to cry.
If you don't know squat about the Inhumans, go read that. Seriously. READ IT.
Inhumans – Complete coverage: 
@Saviour_Queen because she wasn't a threat when she was dead. She couldn't steal May's spot.
Marvel, can you at least wait until she's the one calling herself that.
No but, "Daisy Johnson shakes up the small screen in the upcoming episodes of Agents of SHIELD."

Daisy. Johnson.
Friendly reminder. 
I ranted, gave myself a headache, but I finally got it out of my system. 
Even if I won't be able to buy it, this show deserves at least that.
The CW Warner Bros. Home Entertainment: Release The Tomorrow People on Blu-ray and DVD 
@Saviour_Queen also, May is not her mother nor has ever been. She cares about Skye, yes, but she's NOT a mother figure. She's a mentor.
@Saviour_Queen just because you're a bitter piece of trash, it's just disgusting.
@Saviour_Queen of course she can, and if you TRULY love Skye, then that's what you should want for her. Wishing her bio mom would betray her
@Saviour_Queen (he's a threat to their ship, whatever) but Jiaying? She's Skye's MOTHER, for fuck's sake.
@Saviour_Queen it's like they take pleasure on seeing her suffering idk. I mean, I can somewhat maybe understand why they hate Lincoln
@Saviour_Queen she's one of the rabid skyeward shippers, what do you expect....
@Saviour_Queen well, she's part of the crazy group that want the Inhumans to turn against Skye so she'll get screwed over AGAIN.
@Saviour_Queen she hates Jiaying and Lincoln, and claims the show is "shoving down their throats" the skylin ship. I mean, lmfao???
I mean, the shade I've seen thrown at her it's hilarious.
This girl has such a twisted view of this show, it's unbelievable. idk why I'm surprised tbh, even her fellow sw shippers call her crazy.
"she doesn't want to lose her mother again and her other is the one who runs that community"

JIAYING is her mother, not May???
Why does it matter so much what a bunch of random strangers on the internet think of you. This isn't real life.
Oh, boo hoo. Everyone gets hate on twitter. If you can't handle that, then get out. Crying about it is pathetic.
I like this theory about Theta Protocol being Coulson's "summer camp for your inner Avenger." It sort of fits.
RIP OUR ASSES
"The last lines of tomorrow night’s episode lay out exactly what kinds of conflict S.O.S. Parts 1 and 2 will brutally deliver next week."
"that means that almost every member of the various factions ends the episode on a massive — and dangerous — question mark."
"But Scars is the episode which sends Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 2 barreling toward its terrifying two-hour finale."

TERRIFYING THO
"People you thought were on top flail for control, while subtler characters find, shall we say, unexpected ways to assert themselves."

WTF
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Here’s what you need to know about post-Ultron adventures 
@nymehria @Saviour_Queen OMG I DIDN'T KNOW THIS, THANK YOU
@nymehria ahh, claro, mis materias son anuales. Avisá cómo te fue :) voy a rezar por ti (?)
@nymehria por qué tan pronto tus midterms, tho? :| los mios no son hasta junio/julio. 

*al estilo porrista* TU PUEDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@nymehria @Saviour_Queen listen to her, she knows more about spanish grammar than me, seriously
@Saviour_Queen or the word "rey" (king) the plural is "reyes" :)
@Saviour_Queen like with the word "papel" (paper) that ends in a consonant, you add "es" at the end to form the plural, so it's "papeles"
@Saviour_Queen is this about spanish grammar or english?? Because I'm confused lol
@Saviour_Queen it says that you have to add "es" when the singular ends in a consonant or in "y"
Where is the lie. 
@Kenzmalikov welcome to the aos fandom, donde la empatía es nonexistent
@Saviour_Queen well, that's my biggest fear. Or that Jiaying will die somehow, this time for real. And Skye will fucking lose it.
@Saviour_Queen oh god, what would happen if SHIELD kills Jiaying? (besides me having a mental breakdown)
@Kenzmalikov por un segundo que en el grupo de Inhumans esta la MADRE. Y que Skye claramente siente esa conexión.
@Kenzmalikov nah, porque todos estos son stans de May y los que no, se creen que Skye estan siendo caprichosa. Nadie se paró a pensar
Also, I can't condemn someone for doing something I've done a hundred times myself.
@Kenzmalikov exacto??? Por qué Skye no puede tener dos familias, por qué tienen que elegir si o si a una??
@Saviour_Queen if she says they have nothing to fear from them, then they should trust her. She's the one that spent time with them??
@Kenzmalikov cuando les dice a May y Coulson "we just wanna be left alone" ese "we" no es ella, es su mamá. Esa son las palabras de Jiaying.
@Kenzmalikov no se dan cuenta que esto no es por los Inhumans, es claro que Skye lo hace por Jiaying???
@Saviour_Queen she isn't even attacking her, she's just trying to prove a point, and she's right. Coulson and May should trust Skye more.
Can you seriously blame her for not wanting to lose her? Because that's what will probably happen if she chooses SHIELD.
"Skye is not torn, it's obvious where her loyalties lie."

This isn't about the Inhumans as a race. This is about her MOM.

@BereniceAndrea fue la mejor noticia que recibí esta semana :)))))) o sea, qué CASUALIDAD que JUSTO se va despues del estreno de AOU.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
After watching the new aos sneak peek, I have to say that I can't judge Skye because that would've been my exact reaction to May's words.

CATWS is on tv and I'm crying. No movie will ever be as good as this one.
REMEMBER WHEN MAY LAUGHED AND THE ENTIRE TEAM HAD A FREAK OUT
Jiaying putting Cal on time out and Skye's face being like &gt;_&gt; will always be my favorite thing.

Holy fuuuu-- This is amazing.  
@Kenzmalikov solo les importa cuando van a chapar. Es lo más irrelevante?! Si pasa, yay! Si no pasa, yay! Hay mil cosas más para disfrutar
@Kenzmalikov es que es lógico?! A mi también me joderia que teniendo semejante mundo ficticio, con characters super complejos
@Kenzmalikov *cha cha slides away* a ver si todavía me cagan mi brotp
@Kenzmalikov qué triste la gente que sólo ve una serie por una ship :| más ESTA serie, con lo genial que es TODO.
@Kenzmalikov de ésta forma sólo consiguen ponerse en ridículo adelante de todo el fandom, o sea
@Kenzmalikov si lo único que les importa de toda la serie es la ship, más vale que van a vivir amargados xD que dejen de mirar omfg
@Kenzmalikov por acá una dijo que lo habían acosado tanto, que el tipo terminó resintiendo la ship. No me sorprendería tbh
@Kenzmalikov dios mio, cómo siquiera disfrutan la serie si viven así de amargados

And people think Skye calling Ward candyman was "cute and funny."

lol lol lol lol oh boy
Whoever wrote that line about Ward being candyman, really knew what they were doing.
"was intentionally designed to be very charismatic &amp; articulate, his main source of fear being derived from his warped sense of reasoning."
"Although a brutal killer, Candyman has an especially tragic past compared to most horror icons, which arguably made him more sympathetic"
I just bought the book of The 100.

I'm no longer just trash, I am now the whole dumpster.
@Kenzmalikov creo que ahí me conecté? xD
"I tried. I tried to be the good guy."
"Maybe there are no good guys."
whedon: i write strong female characters bc you keep asking me why i write them

whedon: reduces natasha to a lovesick teenager

whedon: wat
Joss Whedon basically shat on everything that Natasha Romanoff's character has ever stood for.
Look, if you liked AOU, that's fine. But don't you fucking DARE tell me that what Whedon did to Natasha wasn't character assassination.

@Saviour_Queen this is hilarious, I've even  seen people who ship skyeward say she's crazy.
@Saviour_Queen negative!
NOT 3:30 AM 

DON'T DO THIS TO ME
I'm 100% freaked out right now. And that never happens?? Holy shit.
The theory of randomness is bullshit. There are no coincidences, /everything/ has a reason.
@nymehria SABÍA QUE TE IBA A GUSTAR xD es tan azul que lo veo a quince metros de distancia omg
WHO DOESN'T LOVE CREEPY CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!
I'm watching Knowing (2009) 
This movie is 100% trash and not the good kind. Time to switch to Netflix.
@Saviour_Queen psychology has always been one of my favorite classes, both in high school and in college.
@Saviour_Queen same, studying the way people behave and why the do the things they do, is always so fascinating.
@Saviour_Queen ah, I've met one of those :)))) no kidding, every person is an entire universe. It's intriguing and weird xD
YOU CAN'T CUT THROUGH SOMEONE'S SKULL WITH JUST A SWORD OH MY GOD GET OUT
This movie is so fucking lame. Blood does not come out pouring like a god damn fountain when you stab someone.
@Saviour_Queen lying and/or exaggerating things to get attention. I've learned that the hard way.
@Saviour_Queen also, pro tip? People who are /so/ open about the shit they've gone through, are more often than not,
@Kenzmalikov 
@Saviour_Queen you can't always predict what people'll do :/
@Saviour_Queen and that should be respected. Sometimes telling someone stuff about you is unavoidable
@Saviour_Queen that's the right thing to do. If they don't talk about it openly, it's because they have a reason not to
I'm watching 300: Rise of an Empire (2014) 
@Saviour_Queen and whatever little bit I do give away, it's always been on purpose because I want you to know it.
@Saviour_Queen thing is, being open about your life means giving people things that they can use against you. So I don't. Ever.
@Saviour_Queen and some others are just so guarded, it's almost impossible. Those are the most interesting ones.
@Saviour_Queen nah, I'm the same. It's always interesting trying to figure out people, and reading between the lines. Some people are easier
How do people make pretty icons. Seriously, what kind of sorcery do you use.
@Saviour_Queen it didn't, don't worry :) I've been through some rough times, but compared to other people, my life's been a walk in the park
@Saviour_Queen now I'm curious, what have you figured out about me?

Honestly tho, I'm just going to pretend Age of Ultron never happened and that Natasha's last appearance in the MCU was CATWS.
@nymehria no me sorprende, Chloe es imparable. Es peor que Skye :P

[drops mic]

Good night.
I know some people think I hate him, but I don't. What I do hate is the way he's wasting the potential that he has to be a better man.
But /one/ phone conversation makes no difference at this point. It's not enough.
His phone call with Coulson was the first time during the entire season, that I saw him acting like a decent human being &amp; not like a jerk.
when he hasn't done a single thing to prove that he /wants/ to change?
It's been over a year, and he hasn't changed his ways. So how can you expect the team to even try to give him a chance
He's still acting like he did when Garrett was alive. And back then, it was understandable, but now it's just not anymore.
I wholeheartedly agree with this. But thing is, I don't see Ward doing absolutely anything to be a better person.
"If you keep hurting someone when they're trying to do better, how are you any different from the people who hurt them in the first place?"
*narrows eyes* don'T YOU DARE

@Kenzmalikov also, tenias razón con Bellamy xDDD definitivamente va a mi lista de idiotas favoritos.
@Kenzmalikov neeeeeeeeeeh, dejame con clexa, gracias :P
@Kenzmalikov quizás insisten porque saben lo que pasa en el libro? idk
@Kenzmalikov meh, a mi me ENCANTA como estan ahora. Esta más que claro que se respetan y se quieren bien, y eso es hermoso.
@Kenzmalikov porque no la shipee, sino porque literalmente no paso NADA. Ninguno de los dos jamás dio indicios de sentir algo por el otro :|
@Kenzmalikov lo de Alycia lo leí el otro dia :3 yikes, yo sigo sin entender por qué rompen tanto con esa ship? No lo digo de mala ni
@Kenzmalikov aha, esto quería saber. Se sabe maso qué cosa shippea cada actor o...?

I was just happily singing to Christina Perri, making a Clarke gifset and I get a message telling me about this bullshit. honESTLY
If you can't live your life without being constantly worried about what I do/say, then you need professional help.
So because stalking my twitter wasn't enough, now this girl is also stalking what gifsets I like. Talk about being sick.
My special talent is finding connections to agents of shield in literally every other tv show that I watch.
Laughs @ myself because as I was answering that ask, I kept thinking about Lexa and now I'm like ...OH.
*stressing out intensifies*
She's a good leader, but a shit fighter. She always gets knocked out.
I don't even want to THINK about Clarke being alone in the woods. Nope. No. Fuck no.
"You don't have to do this alone."
"I bear it so they don't have to."
"If you need forgiveness, I'll give that to you. You are forgiven."
I s2g if I get another ask about Lincoln being Skye's brother, I'm going to block you.
@Kenzmalikov aaaah okie, eso no me acordaba, si el flashback incluía esta parte o no. Todo esta borroso xD
@Kenzmalikov che, hay alguna escena de Clarke tirada en el piso de su celda dibujando, que no sean las del pilot?
@Kenzmalikov aha no quiero ni pensar en qué estado van a estar cuando empiece la 3° xD
WE'RE BACK, BITCHES

@agentmartinelli you're the best, thank so much! &lt;3
@Nanda_SC also kinda mad bc the way the killed Anya was super stupid. She deserved so, so much better. That was bs
@agentmartinelli WELL... If you could maybe do a photoset with all four of them, that'd be amazing and I'd be super grateful
@Nanda_SC this makes me both super happy and kind of sad lmao
@agentmartinelli YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!

@Nanda_SC I'MMA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE NOPE
I knew Jiaying's scars covered her entire body, but actually /seeing/ it makes it 200x worse.
@Nanda_SC I got the impression that she's had the title for a while now? Doesn't seem like age matters too much when getting it.
@Nanda_SC that makes a lot of sense, tho. I doubt any commander would need a mentor.
@Nanda_SC younger than what she is now? jesus
@Nanda_SC *tilts head* oh. Well, guess this means I have to rewatch season one. WHAT A TRAGEDY OH NO. :P

"lexa not so commander when clarke"

omfg
@Saviour_Queen enough to ask him for help, then she wasn't going to question it. But she didn't want him to be there, that was clear.
@Saviour_Queen she worked with him because it was an order from Coulson and because she trusts his judgement. So if he "trusted" Ward
@Kenzmalikov but that's the thing, he literally said he wasn't sorry for hurting fitzsimmons and for the people he killed. Like ???
@Saviour_Queen thinking that she loves him is just being delusional.
@Saviour_Queen she made it pretty clear that she doesn't want him around, and she admitted to having shot him to kill him.
@Saviour_Queen I still think Ward has feelings for her, but whatever it was that Skye felt for him, it's gone. Buried in the pits of hell.
If after that, you still believe that she's ~madly in love~ with him, then you don't know shit about Skye.
You do realize Skye literally admitted that when she shot Ward, her intention was to kill him, right?
@nymehria I'M SO SORRY OMG
And no, one phone call does not make a difference in the entire ocean of shit he's done. Goodfuckingbye.
What's Ward's excuse.
They have an entire fucking race to protect from hydra and god knows who else that wants to TORTURE them and EXPERIMENT on them.
If you think Lincoln and Jiaying are evil, just because you're bitter, then you're soulless. :)))
@Kenzmalikov NOPE, YA LA CAGASTE. AHORA VIVI CON ESO (?)

@Kenzmalikov what did you do
Where is @agentmartinelli I need her to edit those new portraits of Chloe
Elizabeth is sO TINY 
@Kenzmalikov u suck
@Saviour_Queen beats me. It was interesting the first time bc of the novelty, but now it's always the same crap?? I hate reality tv.
SHE'S JUST SO DONE 
@Saviour_Queen I do not understand the appeal. It's been on and off air for like a DECADE.
@Saviour_Queen yep, the new season started today
Why is Big Brother a thing that still exists in this godforsaken country.
@Saviour_Queen *shudders* they're an educated bunch, who can't read between the lines. Basically, they're idiots.
@Saviour_Queen the comments people leave on the aos fb are downright disgusting. I stopped checking it ages ago because of that :|
@Saviour_Queen oh god, Nina get out of Facebook. That place is horrible.
@AgentGabyWard I think this time was a reference to what kind of powers they have, not a romantic thing
@AgentGabyWard because of their powers. Defibrillators use electrical shocks to restart the heart, and Lincoln can use his power to do that.
"Skye and Lincoln are a walking defibrillator. They can stop and start hearts together." 

omg
"Skye doesn't need powers to be super, and she proved it on Agents of SHIELD's Tuesday episode."

THANK YOU @Zap2it
@Saviour_Queen hahaha I'm not always right, but I like to think I know the show/characters well and how they work :)
@Saviour_Queen hahahasahsgdja shhh!!!! The less people know, the better &gt;_&gt; xD
@Saviour_Queen .......you figured out my secret, now I'm going to have to kidnap you. :P
Skye's vibrations activated the electrical charge in Lincoln's body.
"The spark may have been in direct response to his being revived. Her power affecting his."

AND WHAT DID I SAY
Because saying he wasn't sorry about the people he'd killed and dropping FitzSimmons into the ocean certainly does NOT help his cause.
My question is, how exactly does Ward expect the team to accept him back with that shitty attitude and the arrogance?
@the_anna_15 you're welcome! :)
@the_anna_15 that only shows what you've posted/reblogged on that sideblog.
@the_anna_15 you can't follow/like with a sideblog, you do all that with your main blog. It's like a "separate" dash
@nymehria where is the lie
@the_anna_15 of course! I'm awake now!
Season 2B of Agents of SHIELD has been fantastic so far.
I'm just very happy because I legit thought this episode of aos was gonna suck, and it turned out to be amazing.
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
This show's ruined me.

I'm watching iZombie 1x07 "Maternity Liv" 
@Saviour_Queen I think that'll happen in the season finale? But as to how, I'm as clueless as you :/
@Saviour_Queen oh no, he will be back. This season is not done with him yet.
It was so cathartic to hear them say all those things to him. The confrontation was long overdue.
tbh this episode was great. That scene with the team and Ward made all the shit that happened worth it.
THIS IS ADORABLE 
Me every time Ward opens his mouth. 
Also, this episode needed more @Dichenlachman. I don't have Anya anymore, at least give me more Jiaying.
Raina just gave away the plot of Age of Ultron nbd
If Jemma changed it's because of the hurt and pain YOU put her through. So yeah, fuck you, Ward.
THAT WHOLE SCENE WAS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN ALL FUCKING SEASON BLESS
THIS IS FANTASTIC I CANt BELIEVE
"I'm so happy I shot you."
"Yeah, me too."
"Should've aimed for the face."
"Yeah."
"We were a team and a family, and you betrayed us." Whoomp there it is.
I CNAT BREATEH
"Mistakes were made."
"By you."
"And people got hurt."
"By you."
"He's like candy man."

OH MY FUCKIGN GOD SKYE
I'm watching Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 2x19 "The Dirty Half Dozen" 
IT DOESN'T HELP THAT MY DASH IS LITERALLY ALL CLARKE
My favorite show just aired a new episode and yet all I wanna do is keep watching The 100.
@Kenzmalikov LA CARA DE ANYA EN ESA ESCENA ES LO MEJOR QUE ME PASO EN LA VIDA
lol @ Joss Whedon tweeting that after all the bullshit he spat out this week about Coulson
Skye was always a superhero, if you couldn't see that from the beginning, then fuck off.
"Skye is now my favorite superhero."

lol fuck you :))))
@Saviour_Queen this is episode 19, so nope
GOD BLESS YOU, MAN 
aoskru, yu laik branwoda
Also, Clarke is a Slytherin but I'm willing to debate this one.
Octavia is a Gryffindor and I will fucking fight you to death over this.
ohmygo d have you ever even READ Harry Potter, do you even KNOW the houses' main traits. This is OUTRAGEOUS.
DID YOU SERIOUSLY JUST SORT OCTAVIA IN HUFFLEPUFF

OCTAVIA

IN HUFFLEPUFF
@Kenzmalikov LA CARA DE WTF IS THIS JAJAJAJJAJAJAJJAJJA
@Kenzmalikov estuve tentada por cinco minutos xD LA CARA de la lechuza es tremenda
@Kenzmalikov OMG OMG OMG OMG OGM GOMGOMGN 
The amount of times I've written skye people, instead of sky people.
@nymehria fhgjashfsga :(
@nymehria ****hugs****
OMFg 
Can we just... not. You're going to ruin Jemma with this.
"Her plans for Ward are just. Plain. Cold."
"If you thought the way Simmons viewed Skye after her transformation was chilling, you haven't seen anything yet."
"Hint: she's an Inhuman, covered in thorns and might possibly be able to see the future."
"The biggest moment is actually going to come from a surprising source."
A Huge Avengers Moment Coming on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 
"You are the most beautiful broom in a broom closet of brooms."
THAT WAS LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO OMG
Wait a minute, I USED TO WATCH THE SLEEPOVER CLUB ALL THE TIME.
@Kenzmalikov faltaban cinco siglos igual xDDD
@Kenzmalikov *SCREAMS* ANOTAME EN ESTE 
@Kenzmalikov todavía no terminé la season dos xD no voy a empezar nada sin haber visto todo primero. Pero podría usar los prompts como meme
@Kenzmalikov necesito buscar un meme, como para empezar por algún lado xD sino, no sabría ni qué gifear
@Saviour_Queen I've got six episodes left, so you're probably right hahaha
How much longer until I start making gifsets of The 100. That's the important question.

@nymehria eso siempre lo fui :P
@nymehria shove?
@Kenzmalikov es demasiado similar a Clarke. Pero con Lexa es el equilibrio justo :')
@Kenzmalikov ommmmggggggg lo seeeee, es tremenda??? Also yes, que ese era mi "problema" con Bell
@Kenzmalikov hablando en serio (?!) Clarke tuvo más química con Lexa en solo tres eps que con Bellamy en 23 :||| sorry :|||
@Kenzmalikov SI ESTO SE HUNDE, LA TERAPIA (?) LA PAGAS VOS <PENSIVE FACE>
@Kenzmalikov *puts on hazmat suit* MY PEOPLE ARE CALLING *se tira de palomita al tacho*
80% of the sw fandom is trash. Hating characters that've done nothing wrong but forgiving &amp; forgetting when it's convenient for your ship.
Especially when Lincoln hasn't done a single thing to deserve it. Unlike Ward.
But you wishing it was Lincoln the one dying makes you fucking GARBAGE.
lol I'm so glad I unfollowed you. I may not like Ward, but at least I'm decent enough to not want him to die.
I WAS DOING SO GOOD. WHY CLEXA.
"The things we've done to survive, they don't define us." Actually, yes, they do. Because that's when you show who you really are.
This is basically an impossible situation.
Don't get me wrong, he deserves a second chance, but not at the expense of hundreds of lives.
You're willing to sacrifice hundreds of lives to protect the guy who shot 18 innocent people. lol ok
"We've all got a monster inside of us. And we're all responsible for what it does when we let it out."
@Madtheswine13 @Kenzmalikov eh, conozco la trama y no me llama mucho la atención? Prefiero más las series con acción xD
@Kenzmalikov /SCREAMS AT YOU/ SHE'S AWESOME
LEXA IS SO CUTE WITH THOSE BIG EYES ASDGJLGVJFJFN
@Kenzmalikov GROUNDER PRINCESS Y MURIO DE UN TIRO, PATETICO. Debería haber muerto en batalla, MINIMO. Algo más honorable y digno de ella.
@Kenzmalikov encima podrían haber hecho un super buen equipo. PERO NO, TUVIERON QUE PEGARLE UN TIRO. WHY @ WHOWASITIWILLKILLYOU
Status: forever bitter over Anya's death.
@Kenzmalikov FOREVER BITTER PORQUE POR FIN SE HABIAN ENTENDIDO Y CLARKE SE HABIA GANADO EL RESPETO DE ANYA, Y RIP ANYA WTF
@Kenzmalikov y cuando Anya por fin le aceptó la manito, estiró la pata :(
@Kenzmalikov idiots
I'm watching The 100 2x06 "Fog of War" 
She's just so unimpressed. 
Friendly reminder that this photo exists. (◡‿◡✿) 
I know the difference between people who ask genuine questions and those who're just looking to pick a fight.
Don't send asks about ships to fyeahskye because I will block you and delete it. Capisce?
@nymehria WANDA MAXIMOFF, PEQUEÑA AVENGER IN TRAINING
@nymehria PEGGY *llora un rio* also, Wanda.
@Kenzmalikov asshOLE
I'm thinking of seeing AOU again after tomorrow's episode of aos. Mostly because I already forgot 90% of the movie lmao
@Kenzmalikov mejor! :D detesto cuando mi dash muere, asi que no hay problema.
@Kenzmalikov rip
@Kenzmalikov meh, igual al estar en hiatus seguramente no deben postear TANTO? Es hora de stalkear!!

@nymehria EL HOROSCOPO ES IMPORTANTE, POLI
@nymehria Is2g voy a empezar a cobrar por tirar las cartas
@nymehria *HIGH FIVES YOU, CAP*
@BereniceAndrea espera a que se enteren lo de Laura y explota todo.
@BereniceAndrea jajajjajajajajajja aparecieron los Chitauri otra vez y abrieron otro agujero en el cielo? XD
@BereniceAndrea el trabajo que hicieron con CATWS es MAGNÍFICO. Además que ellos SI entienden a Natasha, no como este idiota.
@BereniceAndrea despues de ver AOU, estoy feliz de que el tipo no dirija Civil War. Lo quiero a tres planetas de distancia de los Avengers.
"Joss Whedon says Coulson is still dead as far as Marvel movies are concerned."

Hey Joss, how about you shut the fuck up now.
I'm Black Widow, which Avenger are you most like? 
@Kenzmalikov jajajjajajaja pfffttt las dos sabemos que estamos despiertas hasta las 6 am siempre xD
God bless Canada. 
Yes, good. I'm okay with this.
I got Lincoln! Which Character From "The 100" Are You? 
And by the way, Anya's death was super stupid.
When tiny velociraptor Octavia cries, a puppy dies. Don't make her cry.
@the_anna_15 I LOVE IT :D
@Kenzmalikov I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE IN THE WAY OF A SAD OCTAVIA GIFSET

one day

maybe
"She stopped being a kid the day you sent her down here to die."
@Kenzmalikov I H8 U
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THAT BELLARKE HUG SO CUTEEEEEEEE
me: I'm gonna watch this show for Anya
everyone: but she dies
me: idc
*Anya dies*
me: WTF IS THIS SHIT
Aaaaaaand she's dead.
She's so gonna die in the next five minutes, isn't she.
laughs because Anya and Clarke are literally the same
And how the same things that made Bellamy a better person, were the ones that basically destroyed Finn.
Okay but can we talk about how Bellamy evolved while Finn devolved, when in season 1 it was the other way around.
Ah, Finn is finally showing his true colors :))))))
@Kenzmalikov I run over you if you run over me
lol fuck you, Marcus. I hope you get your ass eaten by a reaper.
THEY ARE PILING UP DEAD BODIES ON TOP OF THEM AND I'M LAUGHING BECAUSE ARE YOU SRS RN
me: ok but wheres anya
*5 minutes later*
NVM I DIDNT NEED TO KNOW
There's nothing worse than being able to understand all pov because you never know whose side to take, because everyone's right.
@Kenzmalikov nah, es que si no hay acción, es un embole. Por eso me gusta esta serie? Ni un minuto de paz, es fantASTICO
@Kenzmalikov ESTO ME HIZO REIR PORQUE SAME CON TODO LO QUE VEO xD
"This place is too good to be true."

SAME
I don't trust nice people.
Mt. Weather makes me 100x more uncomfortable than that troll like thing that just showed up.
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO BREAK THAT SHOE'S HEEL.
I'm watching The 100 2x01 "The 48" 
I finished season one of The 100 without shipping anything. Go me.
IF I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW HOW THIS ENDS I'D BE VERY HYSTERICAL RIGHT NOW
"Hey, Raven? I'd pick you first."

cLaRkE
@Kenzmalikov no paraban hasta que medio whedonverse termine en The 100 xD
Last episode of season one, finally.
@Kenzmalikov SCREAMS
Can someone just kill Murphy already. Please.
is Bellamy srsly playing with toy soldiers, I can't believe
I really like it when Bellamy and Clarke work together. They make a hell of a good team those two.
I'm watching The 100 1x11 "The Calm" 
@Kenzmalikov CAN'T BE TAMED
@Kenzmalikov Finn xD pero idgaf asi que... Hice un happy dance OOPS
@Kenzmalikov igual re que anoche anduve dando vueltas por algunos instagrams y me cague spoileando un monton JAJAJAJAJAJA
@Kenzmalikov &gt;_&gt;
@Kenzmalikov um, si no entendí mal... Octavia es una grounder ahora? Y Clarke es de los sky people? @__@
@lovelyjily @Arrow_AOS exactly, killing people out of anger is not who Jemma is, and it should never be.
@Kenzmalikov ....................

......................................................

..................shit
@Kenzmalikov ....si estan en buenos términos, no? Como que solo llevo 10 eps xD
You're not a real fan if you want your favorite character to do something that will destroy them just because YOU are bitter.
You can't call yourself a Jemma stan and want her to commit murder out of vengeance and anger. That's not how it works.
I don't give a fuck about how much you hate Ward, if you love JEMMA then you shouldn't want her to stoop that low.
If you want Jemma to kill Ward, then you can fuck right off. Thanks.
@nymehria asdgsjshd yesss :3
Well, at least it's comforting to know that the team won't make it easy for Ward.
"By the end of the episode, this character finds him/herself back in the ranks of S.H.I.E.L.D. – apparently permanently."
"Not everybody makes it out of Team Coulson’s mission alive – and it’s pretty shocking to see exactly what goes down."
"Fans shouldn’t expect old grievances to disappear–not even close. Their reunion stirs up ugly feelings for those who've been hurt by Ward."
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 2, episode 19: 6 hints about the lead-up to Ultron 
@Kenzmalikov posta, esa edit/gif de Clarke es impresionante <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Kenzmalikov ES TU CULPA (?) POR REBLOGUEAR LOS MÁS LINDOS
@Kenzmalikov *casualmente le da like a todos los posts que reblogueas*
@Kenzmalikov es tierna y bestia a la vez, perfecta combinación &lt;3
@Kenzmalikov not even sORRY
How does one look hot when looking like shit @ The 100
I sort of kind of really need Octavia and Clarke to be best friends bc of reasons.
@Kenzmalikov es que es medio extraño lol justamente, siempre es todo un quilombo, y en el medio esta ella con sus flawless trenzas wtf xD
@Kenzmalikov o sea, el tiempo y los espejos, porque como que necesitas verte bien la cabeza para que queden asi xD
I'm watching The 100 1x10 "I Am Become Death" 
@Kenzmalikov also explicáme de dónde saca tu tiny velociraptor el tiempo para hacerse 37 trencitas en la cabeza
Can someone give the kids from The 100 a bath.
why are you like this @ me
Also, I'm 4 episodes behind on ouat and I still have to finish The 100 and I wanna start two new shows.
I'm like 6 issues behind on Black Widow and I just downloaded a shit ton of other comics, AND I still have to read the Inhumans book.
@Kenzmalikov concentrate mierda! xD (I cannot type anymore)
@Kenzmalikov estás viendo OB y de repente saltas con este tweet de T100 y me tenté xDDD
@Saviour_Queen I'm team "the girl should do whatever the fuck she wants as long as she's happy."
I should just make that screencap my icon, because that's literally my face 90% of the time.
@Kenzmalikov HASHTAG SOON :333
@Kenzmalikov it better not be, I have yet to get there gdi wait for meee
same 
@Saviour_Queen I don't think they'd like it so much if it were them the ones wearing a dog tag with a guy's name around their necks
@Saviour_Queen it's disgusting and hypocritical
Like, why does Ward get a "free pass" to have a life and be happy, but Skye can only "belong" to Ward?
but I have yet to see someone complaining about Kara and Ward dating?
It's funny (?) how the second Skye gets a possible (emphasis on the possible) love interest, people scream bloody murder
@Kenzmalikov tiny small Jemma con cara de &gt;:| JAJAJAJJAJA ME DA MUCHA TERNURA
@Kenzmalikov ENCIMA JEMMA QUE MINIATURA DSHJGKJADG Y WARD ES UN ROPERO HAHAHAHAHAHDSGJAHJDHA
@Kenzmalikov WARD: RIP JAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAME TENTE
@Kenzmalikov I?MFYSUSDABD CRYIGN
@Kenzmalikov YOU GO JEMMA, I'LL HOLD YOUR FLOWER &gt;:|
@Saviour_Queen I totally understand, no worries :)
@Kenzmalikov ME IMAGINE A JEMMA SACANDOSE LA FLORCITA Y DÁNDOSELA A FITZ MIENTRAS ELLA SOPAPEA A WARD JAJAJJAJAJAJJAJA
@Kenzmalikov hoy leí una que twitteó "you kick his ass, Jemma. I will hold your flower" y me estuve riendo por cinco minutos JAJAJAJJAA
Now if someone could tell us what the fuck this spinoff is about, we'd be golden.
So I'm guessing this means the pilot script was greenlighted, then.
"The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. spinoff is eying a series order, with a second project helmed by John Ridley also in the works."
@Saviour_Queen I think you'd like it, because it's bloody but it's super interesting, character wise.
@Saviour_Queen I didn't want to watch it, either. I was so against it, but then Dichen happened and I caved in. But I don't regret it :)
@Kenzmalikov *whispers* te faltaron las tags tho :P
HOPE WTF WHY DID YOU GIF THAT SCENE
@Saviour_Queen it was bound to happen eventually xD it /is/ bloody and violent, but I've seen way worse tbh
@Saviour_Queen pssst, I started it a couple of days ago and it's really, really good. Kind of bloody, but GOOD.
Look at these two dumb puppies. 
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov awww quedó re lindo! &lt;3 EL SQUAD ES FITZSKIMMONS OMG
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria YES!!! Justo estaba haciendo el icon, queres que haga uno para el de Jemma?
@nymehria JHDGJAGDH AHORA TE AGREGO :D
@nymehria cheeee, querés que agregue tu blog de Fitz a mis afiliados de fyeahskye? (sin compromiso, eh? Podés decir que no, y no me ofendo!)
QUAKE 
@Saviour_Queen sorry, I totally passed out. But here! 
@Saviour_Queen it's the new still from episode 20! And HI, WELCOME BACK TO TWITTER!!! :D
HOW ARE YOU THIS PRETTY

EL GRANDE AVOCADOS
I'm watching Marvel's Daredevil 1x10 "Nelson v. Murdock" 
I'M LAUGHING

I'M ACTUALLY LAUGHING

I'M SO FUCKING DONE
THAT'S EVERYTHING THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REDUCING SKYE TO.

AND NOW YOU'RE MAD AT THIS

UNBELIVEABLE
"this prevailing idea that fitz is somehow her humanity, that fitz is the line between her doing something unthinkable or not."

I'M YELLING
You're getting angry because Fitz is supposedly Jemma's humanity when that's been the entire thing about Skye and Ward. So.........
You do realize that this is exactly the SAME thing with Skye and Ward, right? 
FINALLY 
I AM NOT OKAY??? 
Tumblr is already recommending me The 100 blogs. WTF how do you evEN KNOW?! !
@nymehria "#SIGH #guess now i'm gonna have to kill you" NEVER FORGET THE TAGS
HERE, HAVE A SMILING LINCOLN TO BRIGHTEN YOUR TIMELINE 
Take this guy away from these people. He brings them nothing but pain and anger, and they already have enough of that without him.
Ward is perfectly fine. It's the team who's still torn to pieces because of him.
and took away the most precious thing in her life, which is Fitz.”
“Simmons meant what she said,” Elizabeth Henstridge tells me. “She hates him so much. He did the worst thing possible to her +
"Remember when Simmons vowed to kill Ward? She may finally make good on that promise—or at least try to."

oh, dear.
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov TONY COMO ELSA, GOODBYE
@Kenzmalikov ya nomas de verlo por la ventana, se me cierran loa bronquios (?!)
I'M NOT KIDDING. LOOK AT THAT SHIT. 
I have to go out and the entire city is covered in a freaking cloud of volcanic ashes. <UNAMUSED FACE>
Oh, thank God. Jiaying is in the finale.
Anya is fucking scary. RIP my heart.
@the_anna_15 yes! I finally decided to give it a shot because of Dichen.
In case you didn't notice, Dichen is the only reason why I'm watching this show lol
groUNDER PRINCESS

GROUnder PRINCESS

GrOuNdEr PrInCeSS
@Kenzmalikov yESSSSSS PRINCESS
Octavia is a little spitfire, I like that.
Awkward moment when the show is called The 100 but like 25 kids are already dead.
"Have you seen Octavia?" 
"No. She's /Octavia/, she's probably chasing butterflies."
I'm watching The 100 
@nymehria creí que los Inhumans eran la versión del MCU de los XMen? Justamente porque no podían tener los derechos.
Hold on, Wanda and Pietro are not Inhumans, right? They're enhanced people, like Mike Peterson.
I thought the bunker Coulson was building was connected to the Inhumans, but now I'm not so sure.
Now I feel like I've seen the future or something.
I keep forgetting that technically Age of Ultron hasn't happened yet in the MCU.
HASHTAG TOO LATE
"Coulson tells Gonzalez about the secret base Strucker and List are using to experiment on enhanced people."

LOLOLOLOLOLOL
@Kenzmalikov porque te conozco xD sólo tuve que leer el primer renglón para darme cuenta el por qué de eso JAJAJAJAJAJA
I'm tired and overcaffeinated. That's never a good combo.
@Kenzmalikov seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, cLARO COMO NO :P jajajjajajjaja me hizo reir xD
Checking fuckyeahsimmons and seeing the last post my sister reblogged and CACKLING BECAUSE I SEE WHY YOU DID THAT, YOU LIL SHIT &lt;3
idek what the fuck happened, all I care about are Natasha and Wanda. Those two made the whole thing worth it.
WANDA MAXIMOFF

BABY AVENGER
@BereniceAndrea lloré en una parte pero seguramente no por las mismas razones que vos xD mandame DM si querés, ya estoy en casa :)
*tries really hard not to scream about the thing because I literally started crying when I saw it*
I mean, they got the thing back with help from some "old friends"? Don't tell me that help wasn't Coulson.
Okay but when will the cast of @AgentsofSHIELD show up in one of the movies. Like, come on now. It's time.
I have so many mixed feelings, plot wise though. So much unnecessary, pulled out of nowhere, totally random shit.
@nymehria RIGHT THERE WITH YOU
THAT ENDING. THAT FUCKING ENDING, OH MY GOD I'M YELLING
@BereniceAndrea recién salgo, pero bancame que llegue a casa que estoy en el medio del shopping todavía xD
@nymehria GOOD LUCK, PLS DON'T DIE
I would tweet pics, but I'm already inside and the movie's about to start, so I'll see what I can do later.
RIP MY ASS 
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the fact that Chloe's keychain is the SHIELD logo.
@uhvengers *high fives you* :P
I LAUGHED.  
@nymehria shush, you! Also, buen dia :)
@Kenzmalikov sólo vi cuatro eps, cuando llegue a la mitad approx te aviso (?)
@Kenzmalikov NOPE
Me watching The 100 
@Kenzmalikov I HATE YOU AND DICHEN SFM
I'm watching The 100 1x01 "Pilot" 
@nymehria es un idiota :(
@nymehria el tipo no se da cuenta? Sigue pretendiendo que las cosas vuelvan a como eran antes, cuando Fitz dejó bien en claro que NO.
Baby &lt;333 
I s2fg aos if you hurt Lincoln I'm gonna

cry a lot
"Please, excuse the mess and the, um [stomps foot] the roaches."

nICE
"The internet killed everything!"
"Not sure the internet killed ice cream."
He should've gotten the hint when Fitz nearly killed him. Nobody wants a repeat of that.
The saddest thing is, I actually do believe Ward wanted to know how Fitz was. And that just makes it even worse.
me @ Luke Mitchell
why are all your characters always getting punched/thrown around like potato bags
@Kenzmalikov lol same
@nymehria ooooooohhh nICE
@nymehria esto es por Jiaying?
Beautiful &lt;3 
@the_anna_15 the original article about the spinoff said Adrianne and Nick were being considered, not that they had been confirmed, though.
@Zoroark3496 makes sense, and so where are they? Why do we always see Jiaying making all the decisions? I need to know these things.
*in Loki's voice*

TELL MEEEEE
Are there more elders besides Jiaying? How did they get to Afterlife? How long have they been there? How do they find potential Inhumans?
I just really, really, REALLY LIKE the Inhumans. There's just so much about them they're not telling us &amp; only 4 episodes left. NOT ENOUGH.
Cal makes me feel all the sads. I probably shouldn't, given all the things that he's done, but it's just all so... SAD.
"Sometimes as a leader, I have to do things I'd rather not do." And the scene that follows this is quite interesting.
"We've both changed, we're not the people we used to be. To lament that is a waste of time."
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria BASICAMENTE
#and a wild cal appears because he loves group hugs 

I'M CRYGIN
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria "feels like old times" mientras Kara lo tiene del cuello a Fitz con una navaja. Claro que son old times.
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov estamos como Cal xD en cualquier momento, vuela algo por el aire jajajjaja
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov nah, si estamos todas de acuerdo. Ninguna lo quiere cerca del team. Que se quede con Kara y su cactus.
Hunter trying to reassure Fitz, this scene was everything. 
That awkward moment when the mercenary on the team, the one everyone doubted, is the only one who has never betrayed them.
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria ME REI CON LAS TAGS, NOT SORRY 
Same. 
@agentmartinelli I :) hate :) them :) so :) much :)
@agentmartinelli do I even wanna know what happened?
@agentmartinelli Chloe tweeted Luke about how skyelin had gained new shippers tonight, and the sw fandom is being an idiot
Let other shippers get a bit of attention too. We all know your ship is endgame, so stop acting like spoiled brats.
I love how Chloe is just being a dork, but the sw shippers are already jumping down her throat. And you wonder why people hate you.
I'm 100% convinced that Lincoln already likes Skye lmao
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><UNAMUSED FACE> 
idk it's just Lowell looks too human to be a zombie. He's sweet, but there's something off about his story.
Well, I was wrong about Major, I'm also probably wrong about Lowell, too... My gut cannot be trusted anymore.
I'm watching iZombie 1x06 "Virtual Reality Bites" 
I LOL'D. 
Oh, Lincoln. You dumb, dumb puppy.
"She's a walking miracle, your mother. The way she suffered, and endured, and fought through it."
Maybe I got used to it, but it does have a nice ring to it. It's sweet.
Daisy Johnson. Uh.
"I was supposed to be there two weeks, but I met your mother and I couldn't leave. She stole my heart."
Thanks, bro. 
Jiaying is just so, so beautiful. 

I'm in love, send hELP?!? !!!
I'm watching Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 2x18 "The Frenemy of My Enemy" 
lmao 
Marvel asking the important questions. 
OH MY GOD THANK YOU 
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov doy fe de que esto es 100% accurate
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN MONTHS OF HIATUS
*SCREAMING* | Beauty and the Beast - Season 3 Announcement 
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov es probable, porque encima todo converge en mayo. AOU, el season finale, los upfronts. Es como el año pasado con TWS
@Kenzmalikov si cumplen con la meta de tener el pilot listo para entonces
@Kenzmalikov *sigh* según entendí, los upfronts de ABC son el 12 de mayo?? Creo??? Ahi nos vamos a enterar, o antes tal vez
@Kenzmalikov en pelotas cuando sale su película. Por qué no hacer lo mismo con los Inhumans??!?!?!
@Kenzmalikov aparecieron primero en CATWS. Todos los "nuevos" son introducidos primero de alguna forma para que la gente no este
@Kenzmalikov además todos los personajes que tienen su peli (Black Panther, Spidey) van a estar en Civil War. Hell, los gemelos Maximoff
@Kenzmalikov y para qué introducir TANTOS Inhumans si despues los van a borrar del mapa? Si esa fuera la idea, con Jiaying sola alcanzaba.
@Kenzmalikov si pocos conocen la historia de los Inhumans, y aos no explicó un corcho. Hay muchísimo más que contar sobre la raza.
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria hay quien dice que como ya esta la peli anunciada, que no tiene sentido la serie, pero ??? JUSTAMENTE??
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria y de repente saltan con Bobbi/Hunter, casi todos nos quedamos medio descolocados.
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria capaz es too much, pero como el fandom justo ya estaba casi seguro que el spin off era de los Inhumans...
Seriously. 
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria es posible que hayan sacado esa info para despistar a la gente? O ya estoy paranoica? Qué piensan?
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria por eso yo me quedé re :||| cuando leí el artículo, porque creo que hasta Deathlok tendría más sentido.
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov ni a mi, no se me ocurre qué pueden hacer que no sea lo que ya estan haciendo en agents of shield, o sea....
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria exacto, habian dicho que algunos de aos se iban a pasar de tanto en tanto al spin off.
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov pero la idea original era aos + spin off en septiembre y Agent Carter season 2 en el verano
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov pero anoche el artículo este saltó con que quizás no era buena idea por el tema de los ratings y blah blah.
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov empezaron diciendo que PODRÍA ir al mismo tiempo que aos, que la idea era que arrancara en septiembre junto con 3A
@Kenzmalikov introdujeron demasiados personajes como para no hacer nada con ellos, o solo tenerlos por 7 eps.
@Kenzmalikov es que hasta ahora qué pito toca esta gente en la serie? Su única conexión con SHIELD es Jiaying, pero el resto ????
@nymehria SUS PLEBEYOS OMF nada me haría más feliz que eso, la verdad. Ese spin off tiene muchisimo potencial. ALSO DICHEN Y LUKE &lt;333
@nymehria nah, estoy totalmente de acuerdo con vos. Me encantan los dos, pero no los veo sosteniendo un spin off ni a palos.
@Kenzmalikov con los Inhumans, sobre todo con eso de que Jiaying "tiene planes" para ellos? idk
@Kenzmalikov yo sigo pensando que el plan de Coulson (eso de que esta armando tipo un búnker para los gifted) puede tener alguna relación
@nymehria "LOVE IN THE TIME OF NEW!SHIELD"
@nymehria Whedon te oiga (?) porque posta que no veo cómo puede quedarse, si no es "conectada" a aos a traves del spin off.
@nymehria yo estaba casi segura también, pero el artículo de anoche de Bobbi/Hunter medio que me tiró abajo?
@Kenzmalikov siento lo mismo, puede que sea super estricta, pero no mala. Confío en ella. Lo cual me hace tener miedo por su seguridad xD
Because if the spin off is not about the Inhumans, then there's no way they're going to keep her in aos. Of that I'm sure.
Just thinking about what aos might do to Jiaying to make her go away, makes me stomach sick.
@Kenzmalikov dudo muchísimo que Skye vaya a cortar la relación así nada más.
@Kenzmalikov el tema es qué excusa van a inventar para hacerla "desaparecer"? Porque a menos que Jiaying resulte ser alta bitch
@Kenzmalikov "LOOK MA, I MOVED A MOUNTAIN" xD
@Kenzmalikov igual me estoy atajando para lo que sea que vayan a hacer Jiaying :/
@Kenzmalikov mi pequeño bebe terremoto que causa avalanchas y rompe copas *llora*
@Kenzmalikov dios mío, y cómo lloré la noche que salió 2.10 pero ahora admito que todo valió la pena &lt;3 INHUMANS &lt;3333
@Kenzmalikov TE ACORDAS CUANDO SUDABAMOS LA GOTA GORDA PORQUE ESTÁBAMOS SEGURAS QUE TODO SE IBA AL QUINTO INFIERNO hahahahah :')
The only people pissed at the writers are those who're throwing tantrums because the show's not catering to their whims.
"HEY WRITERS! You realize everyone is pissed at you? #doesnt matter who you ship #everyone is pissed at them."

No? I'm very happy with aos.
Why are you so attractive, wtf man. 
@the_anna_15 ha, this is the reason why the sw fandom lost me. I got sick of everyone always blaming Skye for everything.
"Joss Whedon was outlining Avengers: Age of Ultron when we were breaking the story for the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. pilot."

LORD
hoLY CHRIST 
@nymehria DHJAKJHALDHAJHKHADJ CUBO KJADHKDJHKAJDHKADH
@nymehria mi cerebro está frito por haber madrugado omg YO LA SABIA ESTA
@nymehria *se desliza lentamente debajo de la mesa en embarrassment* byyyyeeeee
@Saviour_Queen ...........................I'm sleep deprived. that's my excuse
@the_anna_15 and much simpler
#2013FANDOMTHROWBACK 
hashtag mildly concerned
"How will Skye react to seeing her psycho stalker working with her SHIELD family? Let's just say she won't be as into it as we are."
@Saviour_Queen guess we'll see
@Saviour_Queen and every time she hoped, everything ended up going to hell. You and I both know this "happiness" isn't gonna last.
@ShieldAgentP hahaha that's one way to look at it :)
I should take a page out of Skye's book and learn my damn lesson.
"Deep down, I think you knew."
"I was too afraid to hope."
"Hoping for something and losing it, hurts more than never hoping for anything."
*heart eyes* 
It's not confirmed yet, oh my god. The headline said "eyed to" which means they're being CONSIDERED.
Nooooo! 
@BereniceAndrea ya me bajé el archivo, GRACIAS! &lt;3333
@Saviour_Queen I'm still screaming
A ZOMBIE NAMED LIV MOORE

*DELETES SELF*
OH MY GOD

IT TOOK ME OVER A MONTH TO REALIZE THAT "LIV MOORE" IS A FUCKING PUN
@BereniceAndrea yesssssssssss!!! GRACIAS, SOS MI SALVACION &lt;3
@BereniceAndrea jajajajajajajajajajajaj dale, no hay drama xD
@BereniceAndrea anniebosa@yahoo.com nah, solo los que me faltan, del 11 al 16 :)
"Hi, mister Black Bolt. I feel like you and I may have some contact in some point. That's not a spoiler!!"

CLARK FOR FUCK'S SAKE
@BereniceAndrea me los podés mandar? si?
@BereniceAndrea oh my god, el último que leí fue el #10 con Barton.
@BereniceAndrea hsfkahskfjhsf en qué numero estan ahora?
@BereniceAndrea TENGO QUE BAJAR TODO DE NUEVO INCLUYENDO EL PROGRAMA PARA LEERLOS, NO TE RIAS DE MI DESGRACIA
@BereniceAndrea nope, me colgue cuando cambié de laptop y me quedaron todos los números en la vieja :|
@BereniceAndrea yo voy despacio a proposito, asi me dura más xD igual me faltan solo 4 eps para terminarla. *llora*
@BereniceAndrea pará que todavia tengo que terminar DD jajajajdhasjdhakh TOO MANY TV SHOWS
@BereniceAndrea son 8 eps nada más, el dia que salga en Netflix me la veo en una sola noche xD
@BereniceAndrea HASHTAG SOON
@BereniceAndrea sigo esperando que me pongan Agent Carter en Netflix &gt;:| asi la puedo terminar de verrrrrrr
@BereniceAndrea also Netflix con Daredevil ASI NO DORMIMOS NUNCA MAS
@BereniceAndrea jajajajaja tengo todas las pelis de Marvel en dvd, venite y hacemos maratón :D
@BereniceAndrea venite, y vamos juntas :P
Where is the lie. 
@BereniceAndrea dios mio, la general acá sale 40 :| y creo que 50 la 3D. Pero mis cines son bahienses, no internacionales xD
@BereniceAndrea 100?!?!?! Yo la pagué 70 y eso incluye el recargo por ser anticipada :|
@BereniceAndrea 9 dólares con 15 centavos según me dijeron
@the_anna_15 damn, it's cheaper than I thought. Thanks! :)
@the_anna_15 I'm guessing we'll probably find out about it in may?
@the_anna_15 nah, it's fine. We have zero info, so worrying would be dumb at this point.
Wherever Skye goes, I'll follow. So it makes no difference to me whether she stays in agents of shield or leaves to be in another show.
Am I the only one who's not worried at all about Marvel's new show and/or the aos spin off?
Yeah, yeah, can you tell me who's going to play Clary now? Because that's all I care about tbh. #WhoIsClary
Holy fuuuu- 
@PieceToMyPuzzle anyone who hates Skye, can't be trusted, period.
Look at this angel face. 
Coulson omg you can consider yourself lucky if Ward doesn't put a bullet between your eyes, this ain't the time to be cocky
"Help me and I'll let you walk away."

I'M LAUGHING BECAUSE ?????
THIS MOVIE IS SO STRESSFUL.
How long until Michelle Rodriguez's character gets killed? Because her characters never survive a movie.
I'm watching Battle: Los Angeles (2011) 
@Saviour_Queen *and they limped happily away from finals* THE END
@Saviour_Queen I'll run you over if you run me over afterwards :P
@Saviour_Queen ngl, I'd do the same HAHAHAHAHA
@Saviour_Queen THE PICTURE, I'M CRYING
I love this. <THUMBS UP SIGN> 
me: I hate ham
me: puts ham in grilled cheese 
me @ me: why are you like this
@nymehria encima todos los que ya la terminaron te dicen que no hay evidencia. xD Y Skye creció en Texas, so... #fail
@nymehria de dónde sacó ese artículo que es el mismo orfanato cuando nadie jamás lo nombró en DD?
@nymehria el tema no es de dónde salió en aos, si no de dónde salió en Daredevil. Porque ahí nunca dijeron el nombre del orfanato?
@Saviour_Queen nope, I'm super behind :/ idk what happened because I'm all caught up with everything else?? I suck xD
@Saviour_Queen three with this one *hides*
@Saviour_Queen sad and lonely? xD I really need to catch up omg
@Saviour_Queen I was looking for gifs of it because I was curious, and jesus, kill it with fire :||||
What more evidence do you need that the guy's a complete lost cause. Look at his fucking heart.
Holy fuck, that's not a heart, that's a rotten potato.
"Rumple is the only villain that never chose to be evil."

I'm fucking deleting myself from this universe.
i cants top alguhign 
@BereniceAndrea NO ESTOY LISTA NONONO (YESSSSS!!!!)
@Kenzmalikov PARA, ME HABÍA OLVIDADO QUE CAL LE DIJO A SKYE QUE ESO DE TORCER LA CABECITA PARA EL COSTADO LO SACÓ DE SU MAMÁ
@Kenzmalikov YAY! &lt;3 Also, me pregunto si Dichen habrá tenido que "estudiar" los gestos de Chloe? O si habrá sido casualidad.
"#ANNIE THIS WAS UNCALLED FOR HOW DARE YOU #entonces siéntate and piensa en lo que has hecho"

LMAO
@Kenzmalikov *does victory dance* YOU'RE WELCOME
@Kenzmalikov PAYBACK'S A BITCH 
Chloe saying "love you, Annie" and I'm like ...lol
@Kenzmalikov WHAT IS WROG EWITH YOU
@Kenzmalikov me mata cuando Jiaying le da la piedra y Skye la agarra, como Jiaying no mueve la mano inmediatamente después. :')
LOOK AT THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL INHUMAN SOULS 
@Kenzmalikov IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND I HATE YOU
@Kenzmalikov OHMYG DO WHAT THE FUKCAS
@BereniceAndrea que te diga qué vi en clase la semana pasada porque cero idea xD
@BereniceAndrea jajajajaja mi memoria para retener datos de Skye es impresionante. Pero no me pidas
@agentmartinelli and then Jiaying gives May a few of the baby pictures she's kept of Skye, and Skye dies of embarrassment
@BereniceAndrea lo digo por el "I'm a proper southern girl" y por el hecho de que Miles vivía (vive?) en Texas.
@BereniceAndrea pensé lo mismo, pero Skye tampoco dijo nada de haber crecido en New York. De hecho, me parece que ella es más bien del sur?
@BereniceAndrea nope, no hay nada, solo esa mención en el ep 2. Pero lo veo también en tumblr?? Todos ya lo dieron por cierto.
@BereniceAndrea lo digo por esto 
@BereniceAndrea y eso era "St. Agnes Day Care" no un orfanato.
@BereniceAndrea ya lo sé. Pero todo el mundo dice que el orfanato donde Matt creció es el St. Agnes, que Skye siempre menciona, y emm. No.
@nymehria same &lt;3
The name of the orphanage was never mentioned, nor was a plaque on the wall ever shown. Nothing.
Someone please explain to me why is everyone saying Matt grew up at St. Agnes when there is literally NO MENTION of that in Daredevil.
@agentmartinelli CAL AND COULSON HAVING A DAD OFF WHILE MAY AND JIAYING ARE LIKE "FFS CHILDREN" AND SKYE JUST CACKLES
Jiaying will appear in the next three episodes, and this makes me so very happy.
@agentmartinelli TWO SUPER BADASS MOMS AND TWO DUMB DADS. LUCKIEST KID IN THE PLANET.
@agentmartinelli DON'T SAY THAT. SHE WILL GET THE CHANCE TO BE SUPER MOM SHHHHHHH
@agentmartinelli it was so sweet, and then the hug afterwards?? I'm just so so happy for Skye :') YOU'RE EVIL AND I LIKE IT, PLS CARRY ON
@nymehria *swoons*
@Zoroark3496 now this is a plan I like
@agentmartinelli I made a super embarrassing noise when I saw it. That scene where Jaying brushes Skye's hair away... You're evil.
@Zoroark3496 by my italian family standards, yes.
@agentmartinelli your Skye/Jiaying gifset just killed me, I hope you're happy
I've watched 9 episodes of DD and I wanna keep watching because it's so good, but I don't want it to end??!! <FEARFUL FACE>
@Kenzmalikov s top stip sjfosndbksnd
@Kenzmalikov AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THIS NOPE BYE
NOT TONIGHT, SATAN 
He's worse than Barton for fuck's sake.
CAN THIS IDIOT STOP GETTING THE SHIT BEATEN OUT OF HIM FOR JUST ONE EPISODE
"There's a wide gap between inaction and murder. Another man's evil does not make you good."
okay, I'm (so not) fine, so back to DD
I LITERALLY PAUSED DAREDEVIL TO CRY ABOUT THIS
Season two of Agents of SHIELD was about Skye's birth as a superhero. Let that sink in.
"We looked at her journey this season as birth of a superhero," Bell says.
"Part of the conclusion will find Skye finally determining how she truly feels about her newfound powers."
"He's half an idiot."
"It's the other half that counts."
"Smart doesn't come out of books. Smart is making the right decision at the right time."
Is Matt's watch a real watch or a fake one, because this is important to me and I need to know @ props department
Three minutes into the episode and someone already got his hand AND head chopped off.
I'm watching Marvel's Daredevil 1x07 "Stick" 
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov aaaaaaaah me encantó!
@Kenzmalikov she's a serial killer!!!11!!!!!!one
Let me die. 
Do you ever just fucking CRY. 
@Kenzmalikov /sad porque Dichen encima no twittea mucho :/
@Kenzmalikov uuuugggghhhh no but I was thinking the same thing. pls let this happen @ jesua chalupa
@Kenzmalikov OH MY GOD SHUT UP I WOULD DIE
"LOVE, DAD."

I'M SO DONE
Wait, this isn't July 2nd...right? or is it...? 
hmm.  @ChloeBennet4 
Well, hope its your Best. …
He's even worn hydra shirts to idk how many conventions, for god's sake. What do you expect.
I don't understand why fans are pissed at other fans for telling Brett "hail hydra" when BRETT himself jokes about being hydra ALL THE TIME.
@Saviour_Queen if I shipped SQ and someone sent me that, I'd honestly just laugh xD
@Saviour_Queen I mean, it's hilarious but just as a random comment, not to actually send it to people.
@Saviour_Queen HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'M LAUHGING SO HARD
At least the Inhumans don't want to "fix" others, because they know there's nothing wrong with them.
Jiaying told her she was capable of greatness and beauty. She sees the best in Raina, despite all the things that she's done.
Say whatever you want about the Inhumans, but they are taking good care of Raina. What do you think SHIELD would've done with her, hmm?
"Remember that feeling. It's not something to be afraid of." 

Where were you my entire life.
@Kenzmalikov esas sonrisas que solo le salen cuando esta con Skye *llora* el rosa le queda bien a Lincoln xD
@Kenzmalikov quedó perfecto &lt;3 JIAYING EN ROSA THO. RIP ME
@Kenzmalikov ese icon rosa ya lo vi antes hmmmmm jajajajajajhasdjasdkjas ahí lo rebloguee, me encantan los colores! :D
@Kenzmalikov POR QUE NO ME DIJISTE QUE HABIAS HECHO UN GIFSET DE AOS GDI
What just happened. 
oh my fucking god
Fun drinking game: Take a shot every time the villain tells the hero they have a lot in common and watch everyone die of alcohol poisoning!
"That's what makes you dangerous. It's not the mask. It's not the skills. It's your ideology."
"I'm not trying to be a hero. I'm just a guy who got fed up of men like you, and decided to do something about it."
@Cacosa ya me parecía que tenía que ser real, porque sale en varias series. Gracias! :)
Wilson Fisk reminds me of Alexander Pierce, ngl.
"I just don't think I can let myself fall in love with someone who is so damn close to becoming what he hates."
Isn't Rikers the same prison that keeps popping up in Beauty and the Beast?
"Be nice to it. You know, for when the machines take the world."

THAT'S NOT FUNNY, FOGGY.
@Saviour_Queen haha :| we actually saw what happened to his head and it was not pretty haha :|||||||
They delivered the body without the head and I'm laUHGING AND I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BUT JESUS
"Cut off the head of the snake..." 

And another one will appear. Been there, still doing that.
@Saviour_Queen I've only seen the movie and read a few comics, enough to know the basics. But the show is really super DARK.
"I can hear your bones shifting when you breathe." I'm ?????? so ???????? IN LOVE
I knew Fisk looked like the guy at the verge of snapping but holy fuck man, what is your childhood trauma.
@Saviour_Queen yeah, episode four was BRUTAL :|
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WAS THAT NECESSARY
I'M STRONG BUT THIS WAS JUST A BIT TOO MUCH, SHOW.
@Saviour_Queen you asked about Daredevil, and I'm telling you right now pls stay away from this show. It's a HUGE nono.
Hello, Iron Man and Thor reference.
I can't be arsed to watch two dudes punching each other for longer than 40 seconds, I'm sorry.
My only complaint so far about this show is that the fight sequences are way too long.
That moment when an actor in a tv show knows how to use a white cane better than literally all the blind people I know.
I'm watching Marvel's Daredevil 1x03 "Rabbit in a Snow Storm" 
She's just wonderful. That's all.
I'm biting my tongue so I won't vomit a 45 tweet long meta about Jiaying bc I know nobody cares lol
"Without your warmth to guide them through their transformations, these poor souls... 
"They would be lost."
Ming, if you're going to call out every single person that writes Calvary instead of Cavalry, you'll never get anything done ever again.
@nymehria JAJAJAJ no sé de qué hablás, si yo me llevo bien con todo el mundo. *hace click en la dark web* *casualmente contrata un hitman*
@nymehria SI YO SOY INOFENSIVA (?)

*le saca filo al cuchillo*
@Saviour_Queen I sent you a DM, thank you <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@nymehria lo que me revienta es que sea tan poca mina, o sea ni siquiera tiene los ovarios de hacerlo público. Es patético.
@Kenzmalikov la basura se acumula en los rincones, yep
@Kenzmalikov no, es su amiguita
I may be a strongly opinionated bitch, but at least I don't hide behind a private account. :)
@Saviour_Queen ugh... I like Robin, but come on, the Charmings (and I'm including Regina there) are the main characters.
@Saviour_Queen so I take it this episode was a freaking mess, as per usual xD
DELETE THIS SHOW 
@Saviour_Queen I'M THE EVIL QUEEN BUT I STILL LIKE SAUSAGE

OFHALDJFSHKAJFK
@nymehria YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#aboutme  
Ah, no, nevermind, it's the same cut she had when she was shooting 2.21 so it's not new.
*earlier today*
me: Chloe's face looks okay, Skye's not hurt
*three hours later*
me: IS THAT A CUT ON HER CHEEK

bitch stop hiding secrets dammit
@Saviour_Queen I have a problem and it's called Skye is too damn pretty for my own good
oh my gOD 
exCUSE ME QUAKE 
Everyone keeps saying that she's lying and Bell LITERALLY SAID SHE HASN'T LIED ABOUT ANYTHING.
Did no one in this god forsaken fandom read that interview with Jeffrey Bell about Jiaying?!
@Kenzmalikov creo que si?? yo lo hice con esos dos servidores y ya me carga todo como siempre
"Skye is torn between her loyalty to SHIELD and her connection to the Inhumans as tensions rise between the groups."

CAN WE NOT @ AOS
@Kenzmalikov lo encontré yendo por la tag de Tumblr xD
@Kenzmalikov vas a tener que hacerlo dos veces, creo? porque son dos servidores los que estan mal, el 33 y el 41 (?), asi que fijate
@Kenzmalikov ((inspect element en el icon ese chiquitito que te aparece en vez de la imagen))
@Kenzmalikov abrilo igual. Una vez que haces eso, se te cargan otra vez como siempre.
@Kenzmalikov ah, ya lo arregle? Tenes que hacer click en inspect element, abrir el link en una tab nueva y cuando te sale que no es seguro
@Kenzmalikov wtf cómo se supone que rebloguee cosas cuando la mitad de los gifs estan desaparecidos
@Kenzmalikov y yo pensé que era tumblr mobile xD pero ahora entro a la web y es lo mismo. Entonces es problema de tumblr.
Better start prepping for 2019 right? <THUMBS UP SIGN> #inhumans #marvelknights 
NICE RT @Disney See the new #DisneyDescendants poster. It's wickedly good: 
I'm literally running on two hours of sleep and a giant ass latte. This is fINE??!!
"Jesua Chalupa is the cheap version of Jesus." @Kenzmalikov
@Saviour_Queen nighty night! Sweet dreams :)
@Saviour_Queen amen, sister. AMEN.
@Saviour_Queen if someone had taken my baby away like they did to these people, I'd have gone ape shit too.
@Saviour_Queen maybe her "we were ruthless hunting for you" line? But it doesn't prove a thing imo.
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF JIAYING AND SKYE HUGGING AND JIAYING CALLING SKYE "MY SWEET ANGEL."
@Kenzmalikov if Whitehall destroyed her once to become "immortal," he sure as hell was going to do it again. So yep, that must've been why.
@Saviour_Queen this is the same person that calls both Cal and Jiaying "serial killers," so that says pretty much everything about them.
@Saviour_Queen and that is exactly why I'm no longer friends with them
*smacks Cal upside the head* why the frick didn't you just say Jiaying was alive, you dumbass.
@Saviour_Queen some people's perception of these characters is just so twisted, it's sick.
He was talking about the place where he knew Jiaying was waiting for him to bring Skye. :)
But I kept saying that it had to mean something else, because he'd spent 25 years looking for her and he loved her? GUESS WHO WAS RIGHT.
Remember when Cal said he wanted to be reunited with his family in the "afterlife" and some people thought he wanted to kill Skye...
@Kenzmalikov CURSE DICHEN AND HER DAMN FACE
@Kenzmalikov oh god oh god oh god oh god
@Kenzmalikov SHUSH, STOP MAKING ME WANT TO WATCH THAT SHOW
@HPHeadGirl I agree 100%, yes. Send Lincoln, Jiaying and Gordon to the other show, and Skye stays in aos. Perfect.
GIVE ME THIS ONE THING @ MARVEL
The Inhumans are the only thing in aos that doesn't fit with the general plot. This show's about SHIELD, these people need their own space.
No but, Inhumans spin off with Luke and Dichen more like the second season of TTP we were robbed of. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Saviour_Queen @Kenzmalikov I'm not gonna touch that topic for obvious reasons, but know that I agree 100% with you.
@Kenzmalikov @Saviour_Queen PROTECT THE INHUMAN FAMILY 2KFOREVER
*salutes* RT @Kenzmalikov Jiaying defense squad 2k15
Skye having her biological parents does not make her adoptive parents any less important. She can have all four of them.
Honestly, if you hate Jiaying please unfollow me and never talk to me. Thanks.
They /were/ a happy family with baby Skye until that happened, and then everything went to shit.
It's heartbreaking to think if Jiaying hadn't been taken away, Cal wouldn't have lost his shit and Skye would've grown up with her parents.
I sent my sister that family photo and now we're both crying messes. nICE
@Zoroark3496 the fact that you said season 106 of SPN and not AOS, tho hahahahaha
@Zoroark3496 dude, by 2110 I'm like 99.99% certain there will be an actual, real life Black Widow :|||
@Zoroark3496 print this tweet, that's exactly what will happen
@Zoroark3496 LOL Marvel will make a BW movie before Tumblr gets its integrity back
Stop trying to make uncomfort happen. It's not going to happen.
When is that damn "embrace your uncomfort zone" thing going to go away @ tumblr ??!!
fuck my life now I'm a mess
OH MY GOD I'M DEAD 
@nymehria no conozco ninguno, solamente hay de FitzSimmons y el que tenemos Hope y yo de Jemma. :/
@nymehria booo! No nos vendría mal un blog de Fitzy, que no sea 200% FitzSimmons.
@nymehria ABOUT WHAT
@nymehria yes! Y no sólo eso, también demostró que estaba prestando verdadera atención a lo que Raina decía. :')
@nymehria LE LLEVO COMIDITA PORQUE SABÍA QUE SKYE ESTABA ENTRENANDO &lt;3333 más tierno el chico shfgajsfg
@nymehria *high fives* 
@nymehria son los dos más cercanos a Skye, Lincoln y Jiaying. SHOCKER.
@nymehria me parece que fandom está empecinado en encontrar razones para odiar a los Inhumans?? Curiosamente, los que más "hate" reciben
@Zoroark3496 omg no??? I was moved, but not the point of actual tears. It's kinda hard to make me cry :P
@skyesquakes well, they have given me no reason to not trust them (so far), so we'll see how this plays out in the finale.
@Zoroark3496 guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one.
@nymehria y la forma en la que trata a Skye... No presiona, no fuerza, deja que ella tome las decisiones, y eso me da tranquilidad a mi?
@nymehria me vas a hacer llorar?! Pero si, ella me da la misma sensación :') Tiene la actitud de alguien que vivió mucho, y /entiende/.
@Zoroark3496 Cal wasn't like this when Jiaying met him, you're forgetting that. He became the person that he is now AFTER they lost Skye.
@Zoroark3496 :P I meant the kind of person who doesn't give the benefit of the doubt. You think she's shady, so you're sticking with that.
@skyesquakes I get it, but she hasn't done anything so far that can be considered shady or wrong. She's been patient and understanding.
@nymehria Cal va a los golpes, sin considerar cómo se puede sentir Skye.
@nymehria eso marca una gran diferencia con Cal, no? Jiaying parece más decidida a ir con calma y hacer las cosas bien, mientras que
@Zoroark3496 of course you don't, you're that kind of person.
BLESS THIS TUMBLR USER 
I love how my friends also love/like Jiaying. I chose the right people.
"An asocial person is able to socialize well if they choose to, but doesn’t do so often simply out of lack of interest." #aboutme
@the_anna_15 maybe he is still alive? If Jiaying was able to survive being vivisected, he sure as hell can survive a bullet wound.
@the_anna_15 united against a common enemy, though it worries more who this enemy might be.
By logic, their weapons should be the same color as them. But they're not? So what does that mean.
I'm looking at the new poster and we have red!hydra Ward and blue!shield Coulson and Hunter. But the three of them are holding orange guns?
@agentmartinelli OOPS THERE GO MY PROUD TEARS
@agentmartinelli IMAGINE HER WALKING DOWN THE RED CARPET AND BEING THE STAR. BYE.
@agentmartinelli I'm convinced she will be there, she's the first Inhuman in the MCU, so if she doesn't show up... *angry bird noises*
@agentmartinelli she needs to do LEAST a cameo, she deserves that (and so much more)
@agentmartinelli we will riot
Marvel literally rearranged their entire movie schedule just to add Spider Man. So don't you dare tell me they can't do a Black Widow movie.
I JUST WANT A BLACK WIDOW MOVIE IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK @ MARVEL 
Jeff Bell should just never speak about this show, ever. Interview someone else, someone who actually does watch agents of shield.
DELETE THIS 
@the_anna_15 said every episode synopsis ever since season one. I'm unimpressed, tbh.
Is that supposed to be reassuring, because it's really not. In the slightest.
"Anytime he shows up, it can be for a hug, or to put a bullet in your head, and you’re not really sure which one it’s going to be."

????
tfw you wake up to really nice and super lovely asks and you're like <FLUSHED FACE> but also <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> and <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>.
@skyebobbi same with Jiaying, they didn't know what her gift/power was.
@skyebobbi from what I understood, they took her because they thought she was a potential threat.
@skyebobbi they took her away because of who her mother was. They knew Jiaying had powers so they suspected her baby did, too.
@Kenzmalikov ME E N C A N T A &lt;3
"#inhuman queen"

OH MY GOD HOPE THAT TAG
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria nada que ver con nada, pero mis menciones son todas rosas y violetas gracias a sus icons &lt;3333333
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov jajajajsdajhskjsfkjhasf es perfecto y 100% accurate &lt;3
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria enteras, si. Lo de la gripe está por verse :P *agrega chocolate junto al ibuprofeno*
me watching agents of shield 
Coulson called baby Skye "angel eyes" and now Jiaying called her "my sweet angel." Let me cry.
@BereniceAndrea nope, mirá los años que pasaron y todavía seguimos todas acá :)
@BereniceAndrea *hugs you super tight* la familia es linda, pero a veces te dan ganas de sopapearlos.
Why do you want to see a dad off.
Why do you want to see a mom off.
Why can't Skye just have two sets of parents that love her.
@BereniceAndrea ahí ya estaríamos pidiendo mucho, me parece. Algunas personas no saben callarse.
@BereniceAndrea al menos tu mamá te defendió xD si hasta a ella le molestó, espero que tu abuela se entere de una vez por todas.
@BereniceAndrea ugh, es que si, le podés dejar pasar una cuantas, pero obviamente en algún momento te va a pegar feo. :/
Robert Downey Jr. posts selfies on his instagram and tags himself. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@BereniceAndrea jajajajajshfasjh entonces lo mejor que podés hacer, es tratar de no darle bola. Mandala a la mierda y ya.
@BereniceAndrea si su intención no es lastimarte, lo va a entender.
@BereniceAndrea y si lo hablás con ella? Decile que hay ciertos comentarios, o la forma en la que los hace, que te duelen.
@BereniceAndrea dicen las cosas de cierta forma sin darse cuenta que duele.
@BereniceAndrea nah, te re entiendo. Aunque quizás tu abuela no lo haga de mala? A veces los mayores
Hope: asks a question about Skye
me: *pulls out essays, flash cards and a pie chart* MY TIME HAS COME
@BereniceAndrea *aplasta a tu abuela como si fuese antman* &gt;:|
@Kenzmalikov jfc te contesté un essay mas o menos, sorry xD
@Kenzmalikov *LLORA UN OCEANO*
My favorite thing in this world is when people ask me questions about Skye because "you know more."
@Saviour_Queen very? There /is/ blood and sometimes brain eating, especially the bad guys.
And yes, I'm still convinced that she will change her name at some point.
But now that she found out her mom is alive, then I'm going to guess she could/will be the reason.
I've been wondering how or why would Skye want to change her name to Daisy. Because it never seemed to me that she'd do it for her father?
@BereniceAndrea yesssss, ambas cosas. Me arrepiento mucho de haber querido saber qué pasó en Bahrain xD
@BereniceAndrea sé que la idea es abrir el camino hacia la película, para familiarizar a la gente con esta raza.
@BereniceAndrea todavía falta, pero si no piensan incluir a esta gente en la película, posta no entiendo entonces para qué los introdujeron
@BereniceAndrea estoy segura que va a tener alguna participación. Es la primer Inhumana del MCU, o sea...
@BereniceAndrea same, pero se supone que va a ser la historia de la familia real. Así que no se cómo encajaría la gente de Jiaying.
&lt;3 RT @Kenzmalikov Skye went from having no one in her life to having two families, one by heart and one by blood :')
LOOK HOW PROUD SHE IS OF HERSELF 
The movie is like three years away, though, There's still plenty of time, and I'm almost positive she'll have at least a cameo.
“From her van, and now she’s Quake. That’s very cool in the span of two seasons. It’s crazy."
she’s very happy with her character’s current direction. "They've given Skye an origin story,” she said.
Bennet says that while there have been no talks ("Not at all, actually, but I would like that talk, though. Soon, please?”)
Ravi and Liv's friendship is just beautiful.
"If she had spent more time reading than flipping the bird to gravity, she'd know that you're going down when you fly too close to the sun."
"Food on a stick, you're so juvenile." 
"Cake pops!"
"Corn dog!"

SHE DIED IMPALED ON A TREE BRANCH.
I'm watching iZombie 1x05 "Flight of the Living Dead" 
Don't call yourself a Skye fan if you're going to hate her mother when she's literally given us NO REASON to.
So it's okay to still love a character that's murdered idk how many people but we have to hate this woman bc she "looks shady"? Fuck off.
"Jiaying wants to protect her family and the Inhumans under her care—that’s her priority and she hasn’t lied to Skye about anything."
I have this weird feeling that somehow Coulson's summer camp for your inner avenger and Jiaying's plans for her people are connected.
'Agents of SHIELD': What does Jiaying really want? 
@Saviour_Queen *high fives back* I want her to stay, pls let her stay @ aos (or give her and her people their own show)
I love Jiaying. Like, A WHOLE LOT.
I REGRET EVER ASKING ABOUT BAHRAIN.
"Deep down, I think you knew." 

Told ya.
Skye blurted out her life story because she was testing Jiaying. She wanted to see her reaction bc she already knew.
*narrows eyes at Lincoln* 

He likes Skye already. I can see it.
That song?! It's Skye's theme from season one, I can recognize the notes, but it's mixed with the one from her transformation.
I'm watching Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 2x17 "Melinda" 
@Dichenlachman aaaaah!! I'm so happy to see you tweeting! :D Jiaying is just fantastic &lt;3

Didn't I tweet earlier today that Skye's age was 26.
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov SAME. Todo el tiempo.
same 
That Skye/Jiaying sneak peek has almost 58k views and I'm p sure 50k are mine.
@PieceToMyPuzzle I KNOW. I'm not one to use pet names on people, but I can't help it with her. SHE'S JUST TOO CUTE.
@PieceToMyPuzzle IT'S SO CUTE?!?! I sometimes call her "pequeño terremoto" which means little earthquake in spanish &lt;3
"Baby Quakey" I say, talking about a 26 year old woman that can literally make my insides vibrate until they blow up.
Look how cute baby Quakey is &lt;3

@Saviour_Queen and that was only episode 2 hahaha and from what I've seen. it gets "worse"
@Saviour_Queen yeaaaaah, there was this scene were the found a girl (Karen) literally covered in this guy's blood... That wasn't pretty xD
@Saviour_Queen yep, exactly.
@Saviour_Queen I've only seen two episodes but so far it's been pretty bloody and very explicit in that sense. Also, violent.
@Saviour_Queen DareDevil :D
DD is amazing, don't get me wrong. But it's also very bloody and very violent, and obviously not for everyone.
If you knew what you were signing up for before you started watching, then you don't get to complain about it.
Why on heaven's name would you watch a tv show that's rated for mature audiences if you can't tolerate the sight of blood.
I am trash. 
@Saviour_Queen yep, I won't get spoiled by the US but I can't scream about it with anyone hahaha fml xD
@Saviour_Queen same thing happened with catws xD I had to keep my mouth shut for a week. WORST WEEK EVER.
@Saviour_Queen I'M SO EXCITED SDHGAJKGDJH I promise I won't say anything, so don't worry about spoilers coming from me :)
Countdown: only 10 days left until the premiere of Age of Ultron.
@Saviour_Queen aw crap, then maybe stay away from the Marvel fandom until you get to see it? Because there will be spoilers :|||
@Saviour_Queen I don't think so? They won't see it until May 1st. Do you get it the same day or a week earlier?
Oh, god. Natasha.

"I'm AJ and I'm into white chicks. Really white chicks. You might just be my Moby Dick."

DELETE THIS
@Saviour_Queen LOL Tumblr loves to complicate things, but that's not how the real world works.
@Saviour_Queen I research on my own, because they're hardly ever right about anything.
@Saviour_Queen in my almost 5 years on tumblr I've learned to never take anything anyone says seriously. If I have doubts
@Saviour_Queen read this entry, it explains it better 
@Saviour_Queen um no, a person of color is someone who's /not/ white or from Europe. You can't be white and be a poc.
@Saviour_Queen it's bad enough her father is nuts, let her at least have this.
@Saviour_Queen hahaha everyone in this show is bananas at one level or another xD I just don't want to see Skye being disappointed yet again
@Saviour_Queen SAME. I will give up on everything else, just give me a sane, emotionally stable Jiaying taking care of her daughter, PLEASE.
"Can you hear it?"
"No, not the stone. The mountain."

GO BIG OR GO HOME
I can't shake off this weird vibe Jiaying gives me, but for the love of god, don't let her be crazy bananas. Skye needs her mother.
I'm not crying, I just have a superhero in the making stuck in my eye. 
@the_anna_15 refuse to even try to make sense of what happened? They owed him that much, I think.
@the_anna_15 exactly! That's what baffles me, how no one asked him why. They all loved and care about him, so why did they
@Saviour_Queen here's hoping, and maybe now Ward will actually have a good purpose in the show.
@PieceToMyPuzzle I'm just... We already have Arrow and Flash and Daredevil... Yet another tv show about another superhero seems too much?
@Saviour_Queen it'd explain why they're both so blinded by their hatred, I guess :/
@Saviour_Queen I've always thought Coulson took Ward's betrayal too personally and that clouded his judgment. Same thing happened to Skye.
@PieceToMyPuzzle how are they even going to pull this one off, because Mike alone won't be enough
@Saviour_Queen yeah, that probably had a lot to do with it since Coulson lost his father. But still, it kinda really bugs me.
Why did Coulson give another chance to Mike but completely refused to even try to listen to Ward.
he's been looking for redemption &amp; seeing Coulson as a key to that. He can help him be the hero he's always wanted to be for his child."
"Coulson is someone that Mike doesn't want to disappoint and someone that he really looks up to. I also feel that from the very beginning +
It's 10:30 in the morning and I had to turn on all the lights because it's so damn dark. It's fucking creepy.

@Saviour_Queen I'm banging my head against the wall
You literally ruined the entire argument by using the wrong word.
"Please don’t make that amazing devolvement about ships!!"

I don't think "devolvement" means what you think it means.
How are you so beautiful, like wtf 
Though maybe I should laugh? Because watching them squirm and feel so threatened, kind of validates the thing they're so afraid of lmao
A certain fandom really needs to learn the difference between being funny and being downright fucking dickheads.
Luke, no. Don't feed the haters.
dorks RT @AgentsofSHIELD Luke Mitchell  &amp; Chloe Bennet had some fun while taping last week's episode! 
@nymehria @Kenzmalikov me estoy riendo pero estoy llorando
@Kenzmalikov no, it means the sky will fall on your head (?)
I'm wearing a black shirt right now, does this mean I'm going to get swallowed by a black hole? Should I be concerned?
This person thinks Lincoln is going to die because he's wearing a red shirt. This fandom needs professional help.
@PieceToMyPuzzle Mina, don't talk to me about John Young unless you're prepared to deal with an ocean of tears.
@PieceToMyPuzzle like I said, it's only been one episode. And this is agents of shield, he probably has about 45 layers :P
@PieceToMyPuzzle are you being this hard on him because of his "relationship" with Skye or does this happen with every new character?
@PieceToMyPuzzle so far I like him, but that's probably because I love Luke and I've missed him xD
@PieceToMyPuzzle we've only seen one episode with him, and I agree with you that there's more to him than what he says.
@PieceToMyPuzzle nope, because she'd be the link between the Inhumans amd the humans. Meaning, the Inhumans would leave aos completely.
@PieceToMyPuzzle but now I'm starting to think the spin off might be about Mike?? Though that's not what I want but oh, well.
@PieceToMyPuzzle if anything, it'd help people know more about them and their story, and it'll lead to the movie.
@PieceToMyPuzzle I never thought Skye would leave aos to have her own show, since aos IS her show xD but I don't see why the Inhumans can't?
@PieceToMyPuzzle Jiaying creeps me out, there's something off with her :|
@PieceToMyPuzzle he doesn't seem shady to me, more like completely clueless about what's really going on with Skye and her parents.
@PieceToMyPuzzle maybe I'll change my mind in the future, but for now I'd say they're just okay, nothing special.
@PieceToMyPuzzle I like Lincoln, I like this weird kinda big brotherly vibe he gives. They're okay together, but it's not like OMG SHIP IT!!
@PieceToMyPuzzle here! (sorry, I was sleeping)

That was so fucking lame lmao
LAST EPISODE EVER

PRAY FOR MY SOUL
I'm watching House 8x22 "Everybody Dies" 
Skye's such a stubborn mule, my god. So emotional and volatile and impulsive and reckless and ajhfgaksjgf I love her a lot, let me be.
Here's hoping Jiaying can knock some sense into that thick skull of Skye's because she needs to understand this.
Like, nope. Coulson told her not to go down there and she deliberately disobeyed him. You can't blame this on anyone but yourself.
Also, Skye basically saying it was Raina's fault that she changed, made me wanna bang my head against the wall.
@sinsajosadia my thoughts exactly!
"As Bennet put it, this begs the question, Who are you loyal to — your blood or to the people you have made your family?"
"Skye’s loyalty to the Inhumans and SHIELD will be tested. It’s going to be the main struggle for her for the rest of the season."
I'm mildly grossed out, not even gonna lie.
"Cal was the one who found her and stitched, sewed and put the parts back together so she could use her healing ability to come back.”
"Skye’s own counselor ends up being the Inhuman leader Jiaying." 

Well then. Inhuman leader.
@sinsajosadia yeah, she's is one of the elders, that's for sure.
Which would (maybe) explain why Lincoln was so surprised when she said she'd be Skye's guide?
"In 1989, Jiaying was one of the elders of the Chinese village where the Diviner was found." So I'm guessing she still has that role?
@Saviour_Queen "her body was found by her husband, who stitched her back together, allowing her healing powers to work."
@Saviour_Queen nono, the actress said that in an interview. And that Cal "put her back together" or something along those lines.
@Saviour_Queen LOL she's immortal though xD or at least that's what Dichen said.
@Saviour_Queen I think there's something off with her? And if there is, he knows it.
Don't blame him though. Mom does have a creepy vibe.
Is it just me or Cal seems kind of scared of Jiaying? He looked slightly terrified when she hugged him.
Well, that was interesting.
People are loyal to other people, not to organizations. Gonzalez should've known that one.
Better late than never.
I'm watching Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 2x16 "Afterlife" 
@Saviour_Queen thanks &lt;3 I try to be as mature as I can, even though I just want them to step on a million legos.
@Saviour_Queen I'm guessing both? They obviously want to get a reaction from me, so they can yell how AWFUL I am. Not gonna happen tho.

@Saviour_Queen nope, I still have to watch aos and ouat :||| yay! I'm glad, and I'm glad you're back on twitter :)
@Saviour_Queen I'm good :) just working on a gifset for Jen's birthday. And you?
@Saviour_Queen I'm chalking this one up to bad writing/continuity. It's been 3 seasons and a half, they should've mentioned it already.
@Saviour_Queen /sad. Maybe we'll get it? Not this season, but at some point. Like, come on, she HAS to mention her birthday eventually :|||
@Saviour_Queen I'm betting on the second option, plus I don't think Emma's too fond of birthday celebrations? She doesn't seem the type.
@Saviour_Queen good question :| Though it looks like no one in Storybrooke celebrates birthdays, not even Henry.
@Saviour_Queen I ask myself this every week xD I THINK she must be 30/31 by now.

I loved Cameron so, so much and she failed me so, so hard.
I'm laughing because Jen was the only reason why I started this show, and I ended up resenting her character so much.

Do you hear that, it's the sound of my heart shattering into a million tiny pieces.
"You were jealous of me, of my family." "Maybe you've got too much and I've got too little."

I would tweet stuff from this magazine, but it's in spanish and I cannot be arsed to translate everything.
@BereniceAndrea eso es literal lo que dijo Scarlett 
@BereniceAndrea NO SE PUEDEN COMPARAR CON NADA, QUE NI LO INTENTEN
@BereniceAndrea puede que tengan cosas en común, como su pasado (?), pero la conexión real es la que Nat tiene con Clint.
@BereniceAndrea sjhajshfasf igual por lo poquito que dice, no me suena a algo romántico. Me suena más a cosas en común.
*aggressively ignores the part where Scarlett talks about Bruce and Natasha being kindred spirits*

HELLO, TO ALL OF YOU CURRENTLY STALKING MY TWITTER, HAVE A NICE DAY AND I HOPE YOU FIND $10 ON THE FLOOR.
My bet is on an Inhumans series. It's the only current story arc worth a spin off that would also make sense, imo.
So if ABC gives it the green light, then it will probs start in September along with aos 3A.
"Details on the offshoot’s plot are sketchy, but it could air concurrently with S.H.I.E.L.D."
"the network might announce the new series at its upfront presentation, along with a promo." /sweats <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
"the project would feature cast members from the mothership series, with the talent deals currently being worked out." /YELLS
why is this happening RT @STV_SHIELD Agents of SHIELD - ABC Developing Spin Off *Updated with more Info* 
@Kenzmalikov "probably slightly"? hahaHAHAHAHAHA
"Don't hate female characters for things that you love male characters for." 

Ha.
I LAUGHED 
I'm calling it skyelin.

This has been a PSA.
"skyelincoln" is not a ship name. You just deleted the slash between their names. I refuse to call it that.
@agentmartinelli she's so underused, and she's supposed to be now one of the main characters :/
@agentmartinelli oh man, a spinoff about Mockingbird, now THAT I'd so watch! I just don't see the point?? One show's enough, tyvm.
@agentmartinelli nope, I'm not excited either. Unless it's about the inhumans, then idgaf
@Saviour_Queen you can do it :) maybe try writing a draft first? So there won't be as much pressure
@Saviour_Queen *whispers* watch one episode, that show always makes me happy when I'm sad :)
@Saviour_Queen FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SPOIL ME, WHAT DOES HE DO!?!?!?!
@Saviour_Queen ABOUT WHAT¡?!?!?!?!
It's a gift &amp; she's perfect, shush RT @AgentsofSHIELD Would you think of it as a blessing or a curse? #AgentsofSHIELD 
JESUS H CHRIST
@the_gunlady the curiosity is killing me ngl
@the_gunlady yep, that's a suspiciously large amount of ellipses.
GUESS WHO JUST BOUGHT HER TICKET FOR AGE OF ULTRON

HINT IT'S ME
@PieceToMyPuzzle I'm still in awe of Gordon's power??? Like, the colors and the way he teleports, it's amazing but not over the top.
@PieceToMyPuzzle same! I'm going with electricity, that could explain why they keep using the word spark.
@the_anna_15 oh god, imagine if their powers somehow amplify eachother. They'd be indestructible. Just gimme the episode now!!!
@PieceToMyPuzzle so I've been thinking that they're connected or they complement eachother? Their powers, not /them/.
@PieceToMyPuzzle I remember some of the first interviews said they'd develop a bond bc of their connection and their powers?
@the_anna_15 I think Ward has more chances of being Hellfire. But maybe Lincoln's power is manipulation of electricity?
@BereniceAndrea YO LE MANEJO LA CAMPAÑA
@PieceToMyPuzzle I'm thinking the same, actually. That his powers somehow "connect" to Skye's, causing the "spark."
@PieceToMyPuzzle it was barely a minute long, it's honestly hard to tell from just that tiny moment :/ ask me again after tonight's episode?
@the_anna_15 you said fire, right? I'm starting to think the use of the word "spark" has to do with that, yeah.
@PieceToMyPuzzle yes?
@BereniceAndrea eh, seguramente va a quedar hecha sandwich en el diome cuando salga el acta de registración de los gifted
I wonder if by "spark" he means chemistry between them or if it's related to Lincoln's powers.
HMMMMM........ 
@BereniceAndrea ya me veo 15 msjes todos con consonantes y uno atras del otro jajajjaja xD
I'm gonna see Age of Ultron on April 23 and I'm gonna have to keep my mouth shut for A WEEK so I won't spoil the US.

AMAZING.
@BereniceAndrea REAL FANS STAY UNTIL THE CREDITS FINISH ROLLING
Are you fucking kidding me?! It was a one minute scene of six people chewing food in silence!
"Whedon says there won't be a post-credits scene because he felt there was no way to top the post-battle shawarma scene from the last one."
"The makers of Age of Ultron want you to know something about this film’s post-credits ending: It’s not there." ಠ_ಠ
DID I MENTION ALREADY THAT AGE OF ULTRON PREMIERES HERE APRIL 23?!

HAHAHAHA
@BereniceAndrea GADJAHDHA AVENGERS AOU ADHGAGDJAHDKAGFJHAGDHKAJHD YA CASI ESTAMOS JAHDGKADHGAJFGA
@BereniceAndrea si??? Ni idea, pero Netflix la tiene así que la veré por ahí en estos dias xD
@BereniceAndrea yo me acuerdo de ver los posters en las calles de NYC xD estaban por todos lados pero nunca la fui a ver
@BereniceAndrea Olivia solo esta en la segunda, obviamente xD
@BereniceAndrea es que la 1° peli es la que salió en 1982 y la segunda es la nueva, la que salió en el 2010
@BereniceAndrea y yo todavía sin ver las dos primeras jfhagksfgas listo, ya tengo planes para el finde.
Look at these two idiots.

"Imagine 1,000 years of evolution taking place instantaneously. That's what happened to you after the mist." holyf uucjk
@PieceToMyPuzzle haha and she's a handful, so one baby is enough for me :P
@PieceToMyPuzzle and neither wanted to repeat the experience or see me go through the same.
@PieceToMyPuzzle I was never allowed to have pets, so I'm used to it, I guess? Both my parents suffered a lot when their dogs passed away
@PieceToMyPuzzle so now my dad refuses to get any pets :/
@PieceToMyPuzzle nope. I had a cat a few years ago and he was TERRIBLE, he destroyed everything and we had to give it away
@PieceToMyPuzzle cats are simply amazing, and she sounds like a very special one &lt;3 I'm glad you both have eachother :)
@PieceToMyPuzzle omg that's your kitty????? SO ADORABLE
@PieceToMyPuzzle gaaaaaah look at that face and those cheeks and that nose! jhgajshgfjahsf
@PieceToMyPuzzle hahahahaha YOU STARTED IT NOW I'M WORRIED
@PieceToMyPuzzle S1: long princess curls, S2: the kinda looking homeless haircut, S3: ???
@PieceToMyPuzzle I mean, she looks amazing no matter what, but... Daisy's haircut... Just... pls no. NOPE.
@NataliDiazF @BereniceAndrea @marijongu @ItsJulianaC @Kenzmalikov de regreso a cuando le contestaba a sus fans y no era tan famosa :P
@PieceToMyPuzzle I think she's letting it grow? Because it looks longer now than it did at the beginning of S2 *crosses fingers*
@PieceToMyPuzzle HER ENTIRE FACE IS JUST TOO PRECIOUS
CHLOE 
<TWO HEARTS> RT @DancingABC Thanks to these kick-butt ladies for hanging with us at #DWTS tonight! 
@Zoroark3496 and we all know Chloe is a freaking troll, she loves to tease and rile us up, so yeah.
@Zoroark3496 sw shippers, unsurprisingly. They're just grasping at straws.
And I KNOW this because I POSTED that interview on my Skye blog.
idk what these people are on, but the interview where Chloe said the words "they might like eachother" she was talking about Lincoln lmao
@Zoroark3496 where do I sign the petition, this is a MUST
THIS WILL FOREVER BE THE GREATEST, BESTEST SHOT OF 2B 
@Zoroark3496 aliens and hydra can shoot YOU to death, what's a ghost going to do? :P
You big dumb Quakey baby.
"Fitz, why did you make me watch Paranormal Activity?" 

ALIENS invaded NYC, HYDRA is everywhere, and you're worried about ghosts?!
@BereniceAndrea @NataliDiazF @marijongu @ItsJulianaC @Kenzmalikov no se cómo harán para remarla una season más sin ella, good luck (?)
@BereniceAndrea @NataliDiazF @marijongu @ItsJulianaC @Kenzmalikov sep, aca la nota 
/screams
@Saviour_Queen here's a happy, fluffy Captain Swan fic that you should definitely read :) 
Sometimes I watch videos of RDJ and I never know if he's being himself or Tony Stark, or if he IS Tony Stark.
@Zoroark3496 that she will finally get a car-friend to bitch about Coulson with? :P
@Zoroark3496 LOL give it a couple more seasons, and we'll be there
@Zoroark3496 absolutely. Though it seems kind of unlikely they'd kill him after bringing him back, but who knows.
I feel like S2 started a week ago?? Where did time go.
So we already got a title and a synopsis for episode 18. Won't be long until we start getting info about the finale :||||||
yay!! <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> RT @LukeMitchell__ Hello amazing people! My first episode of #AgentsofSHIELD is on tomorrow (Tues) night 9/8c on ABC <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> #Inhumans
@Saviour_Queen I haven't seen you on twitter for a while, I hope everything's okay over there :)
@Zoroark3496 that's way too much thought put into a 2 second scene. We'll find out tomorrow.

Agents of SHIELD 
Episode 2.18 - The Frenemy of My Enemy

???!!!  ????
"We can't help who we're related to. But they don't define who we are, you do that with the choices you make."
I'M SOBBING OVER ALIENS THAT LOOK LIKE CRICKETS

???? !!!!
I'm watching District 9 
Second night in a row that I have grilled cheese for dinner. Am I Emma Swan yet.
This is MARVEL we're talking about. The company that plans things YEARS in advance.
And do you honestly believe that Marvel doesn't know whether Agent Carter will be renewed or not? For god's sake.
Why the fuck is Agents of SHIELD in the "save one show" campaign when it's NOT going to get cancelled.

@Kenzmalikov el me genera más WTFs que House xD
"He's not your father, either."
"You know what that means?"
"Your mom is a slut?"

WILSON WHAT THE FUCK
"Are you talking to me or are you writing a Facebook post?" Jesus fuck, Chase.
@Kenzmalikov ESO PASA POR MIRAR TANTO HOUSE *HIGH FIVE*
@Saviour_Queen yeah, what's up with that? He gives them hope and then calls him evil? He knows that's exactly what pisses them off.
House is me. I am House.
"How can you retain every detail of our personal lives and none of this?"

"I find it hard to remember things I don't give a crap about."
@Kenzmalikov YOU'RE WELCOME :D

ps: tus ideas son siempre bienvenidas &lt;3
I'm watching House 
@Kenzmalikov yay!!! me alegro que te haya gustado :')
"#If you don't think Skye is already a hero you're wrong #I'm sorry I don't make the rules"

:)
@Kenzmalikov eso fue lo que más me costó, sobre todo los dos primeros gifs, pero lo logRE xD
@Kenzmalikov jsadhgasjfgajsf :333 me gusta cómo quedó??? y nunca me gusta nada de lo uqe hago xD
@Kenzmalikov JAJAJAJAJAJAJJAJJAJA ARRIBA DE LA MESA ESA CON RUEDITAS JAJAJAJJAJAJAJ

"She spent so much time protecting her heart that she didn't know how to use it."
@Zoroark3496 chopper, it's faster
"We have to live with the choices we make. But sometimes we have to die with them, too."
wHAT is yOUR FACE doing 
@Zoroark3496 I'm gonna have an aneurysm by the end of it, so get 911 on speed dial
@Zoroark3496 nope, I finished 02 and now I'm on 03
@Zoroark3496 CLEARLY I DON'T
watches season one of aos

gets irrationally bitter
HOW CAN YOU RUN IF YOU'RE CURLED UP IN A BALL
I put agents of shield on Netflix and let me tell you what a huge mistake it was.
@Zoroark3496 ...a cookie made of bacon...?
@Zoroark3496 and we have a winner :)
@Saviour_Queen and according to her recent training, shooting first would've been her best option.
@Saviour_Queen interesting, that'd explain why she suddenly dropped the gun and changed her stance. Especially since "technically"
I'm still trying to figure out whether she knew what she was doing or if she just totally winged it.
@Zoroark3496 hahaha it's easier to fight when you have super powers to back you up :P
REMEMBER THAT TIME SKYE USED HER POWERS TO STOP A BULLET 
Honestly, if I see you posting romantic skoulson, I'm going to block you and never again reblog anything from you.
@Zoroark3496 I'm going to order bacon pizza for dinner and it's all your fault, I hope you know that

@nymehria es como si el alma de alguien estuviese atrapada adentro del muñeco AH JAJAJAJAJAJAJA
@nymehria I'M LAUGHING
@Zoroark3496 to make up their damn minds. Is he a bad guy or is he trying to make amends?
@Zoroark3496 I want his character to have a consistent arc, one that fits with the rest of the story, and I want the writers
He knew this was coming and he still signed up for it, he's not a victim. He's an actor who knows what he's doing.
and keeps getting rejected every day? That's not how it works??
This isn't about plot twists or storylines, it's about work hours. Or do you think he's just sitting on set waiting for his turn to shoot
"Brett deserves better than this." Brett signed a contract, he probably already KNEW he wouldn't have as much screen time as he did in S1.
When will Beauty and the Beast return from war. It's been like 84 years.
<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><TWO HEARTS> RT @stugillard Kristin Kreuk a real winning Beauty #batb 
pls RT @Kenzmalikov I'm waiting for (want oops) Lincoln's powers to be similar to John's powers tbh
@Kenzmalikov NUNCA. FOREVER BITTER.
DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT THE TOMORROW PEOPLE OR I WILL CRY
"Lincoln is John's new identity after he escaped from Jedikiah." I'M SCREAMING @Kenzmalikov
@Saviour_Queen a challenge? That sounds even better. :P Wanna send me an ask with your idea? Character limit sucks.
Okay, but you do realize that if you attack/hate the Inhumans as a whole, you're basically attacking/hating Skye, right? She IS Inhuman.
@PieceToMyPuzzle awesome! Thanks!!
HOLY FU   CK
@Saviour_Queen this was on my instagram feed. Coincidence? :P 
I'm both amused and concerned.
My friend once told me I'm the Allison Cameron of fictional characters and these past 3 episodes proved her 100% right.
WHERE IS THESE PEOPLE'S HUMANITY
why is no one taking care of him, why is no one changing his bandage or feeding him or juST DOING SOMETHING
theres so mcuh blood
so

blood
Welp, no credits on this one which means shit's going down.

Hey, Bridgit Mendler guest stars in this one.
You must reach Season 8 level to unlock Chase's sad backstory.
"How do you know she's happy? Did she tell you?" "No, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner."
I'm watching House 
@Saviour_Queen I'm just going to ignore everything until I actually /see/ it with my own eyes.
@Saviour_Queen ugh, I know. I'm just trying to be positive because I don't think I can handle the other option.
@Saviour_Queen meaning Jen would have to act as Maleficent. Doesn't mean Emma will become a villain.
@Saviour_Queen for all we know, Maleficent could do what Regina did to Snow when she wanted to send the Charmings a message
@BereniceAndrea *HUGS YOU BACK SUPER TIGHT*
@BereniceAndrea jajajajaja FINE, por eso nomas te perdono :P eh, mi fandom está lleno de idiotas, nada nuevo bajo el sol. Don’t worry :)
@BereniceAndrea *friend breakups with you*
@BereniceAndrea ugh, igual prefiero Matilda mil veces antes que The Parent Trap.
@nymehria acordate que los que traen las cards son los packs grandes! El huevo chico trae un codigo para bajar un juego. *crosses fingers*
don't mind Jen while she casually sleeps in the middle of the street 
@nymehria fotos, seguro! :)
@nymehria si estuviese segura que los huevos te van a llegar en una pieza, te los mandaria. De última puedo mandarte las cards?
@Zoroark3496 if 2.14 wasn't enough to make you stop, then I think you're a lost cause :p
@nymehria nope, mi viejo me dijo que me compraba el de los Avengers para Pascua. Pero creo que voy a ir mañana igual, por las dudas xD
@Zoroark3496 yeah, well, good for you
@nymehria te queda un dia todavía :P
@the_anna_15 asffksj oh god, I don't even wanna think about that. One hour is enough to destroy me, two hours might just end me.
@Saviour_Queen and then they wonder why everyone hates them. Well, there's their answer.
@the_anna_15 and what the hell is this new SHIELD about, and what happens to Bobbi and Mack. I have a lot to look forward to!
@the_anna_15 oh, I will. :) I'm excited to see what's up with Lincoln and the rest of the Inhumans, and how that connects to Skye.
@the_anna_15 and you keep doing that, you're one of the few good shippers left. :) Sadly, I don't have that anymore.
Not when I can spend that time loving Skye and working on things I enjoy.
And now I shall never speak of this again bc in spite of what certain idiots think, I don't like wasting my time hating on things.
@Saviour_Queen I feel horrible because I kinda made you ship the thing, and now it's just such a huge mess. I'm sorry :/
@the_anna_15 and even at the end of S1 80% of the aos fandom hated sw shippers. And now they've become just as bad.
@the_anna_15 that's what makes me so angry? Because I've shipped sw since ep3 and I know what a hard time everyone gave the fandom back then
@the_anna_15 I honestly only know two of those kind of shippers, and you're one of them. Pretty much everyone else is acting like an ass.
Because everyone multiships Ward and he's allowed to be happy, but Skye belongs to him and only him, and it's fucking GROSS.
contribute to the fandom since day one? That's how they treat people who don't agree with them. And I'm fucking done.
Remember how, when I said I liked skyelance, all the sw shippers nearly bit my head off EVEN THOUGH I'd done nothing but
@Saviour_Queen it's disgusting and quite frankly, it makes me dislike their ship even more.
@Saviour_Queen they want him to be evil so he won't get in the way of sw, there's literally no other reason because they don't HAVE one
@Saviour_Queen why are they feeling so fucking threatened that they have to bully others???
@Saviour_Queen they're acting like S/L are going to get married or something? When he hasn't even showed up yet and we know nothing.
@Saviour_Queen I've seen a lot of sw shippers going around doing the same thing and it makes me blood boil. Just block her?
So now you're not allowed to think S/L are cute bc "S/W is for life." Fuck off.
@Saviour_Queen what a fucking idiot. Just because SHE ships it, doesn't mean you HAVE to, as well.
@the_anna_15 I can only think of her, Emma and Catherine. :P
@the_anna_15 I agree 300% with this list.

1) Skye
2) Skye's hair
3) Skye using her powers
4) Skye's leather jacket
5) Skye tucking her shirt…
@Saviour_Queen that's what I don't get? How are they allowed to use cameras or go anywhere near the set. It's like producers don't even care
@nymehria MFGOJAJAJAJAJAJA probablemente lo sea xD
@Saviour_Queen same, but they don't seem to mind? I like me some spoilers, but this is insane. They ruined the entire FINALE.
@Saviour_Queen I had to unfollow all the ouat tumblrs :/ but it's all ruined and I'm just... Sad.
@nymehria I don't /want/ to, but DAMN. Qué les dan de comer a estos Inhumans?! Compartan.
Chloe and Luke look sO GOOD together?! !! 

pls don't do this to me, I'm fragile
@nymehria SERIOUSLY THO

My husband is back.
He's literally all I have left in this show.
ok but where the fuck is Chase
THIRTEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why does this show insist on taking all my favorite characters away from me.
@Kenzmalikov @nymehria y original! por eso me encantó :)

"Behind what?"
