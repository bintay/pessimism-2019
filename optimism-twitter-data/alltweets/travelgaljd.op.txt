Question: What's a #queen without her king?                                                           Answer: a queen
Attention Givers: takers will keep taking till you stop giving and then get angry when you stop. #staystrong give to those who appreciate!

Reminder; you're not the kind of girl that settles. Keep not settling!
You see a person's true colors when you are no longer beneficial to their life.
@ViewsOnShoes my pretty pink studded valentino's 
@ViewsOnShoes usually "great shoes" or "love your shoes". Men notice more than women.
@ViewsOnShoes lol. All the time. Men- women and kids! Always. I am the shoe girl of travel!
@ViewsOnShoes love my valentino black pumps with gold heels &amp; choo boots with silver chunky heel &amp; lamb skin Chloe black flats-comfy+luxury
@ViewsOnShoes 3 loubitan's. Lost count of the choos- maybe 12??  7 Vanenrino.  Then add some Chloe, Gucci and Chanel and others.

@honeymoonchic @ABtravelgirl so now we love each other from afar and celebrate when we are together! 
@ABtravelgirl @honeymoonchic good thing we don't live near each other or we could end up drinking lots of wine all the time!
@ABtravelgirl #mondays good thing they only happen once a week
@ABtravelgirl this is the result of today!  Cheers 
She who dares, #wins
Ladies who can run in high heels should be feared. #warning #BornInHeels
People need to learn that their actions do affect other people. So be careful what you say and do; it's not always just about you.
You can't force someone to respect you but you can refuse to be disrespected. #BeABoss

I can see someone saying this to @megandoncsecz Proud to pass these genes to u! #StrongSmartSassy. 
He thought he could bribe me to do yard work. Hmm it could work! @ABtravelgirl

Amazing truths! 
Gratitude begins where the sense of entitlement ends. #appreciate what you have!
Live light, travel light, spread the light, be the light!
Plot twist- you have the right to change your mind, change your direction and do what is right for you!
You have to know the rules of the game and then you have to play better than everyone else!
Excited to see this amazing #wedding-guru again on Thursday and honored to be in Hard Rock Resorts… 
Real world #truth: don't feel entitled to anything you didn't sweat and struggle for!
Observation; if u put as much effort into being a good person as u do in pretending 2 B a good person, u might actually B a good person!
Spring has sprung!  Which = yard work.

First #easter in 8 years that I'm not with @megandoncsecz in some exotic location. What!?!?
Want to be happy? Stop hanging around negative people! A Positive life starts with a positive attitude.
Love being in the #wedding business. So lucky to meet the best in the biz @randyfenoli

Remember, never take advice from an unhappy person!

@hconnickjr Mr. 80's trivia perfect time to chime in! I'm the copilot! Where's your 80's album cover?
#Mean people don't bother me a bit. #Mean people who disguise themselves as nice people, bother mean a whole lot!
If I had an 80's record album this would be it's cover. Title would be #drive  A mix of the Go-Go's and Blondie! 
@4divinedeals tell me about it!  So simple.
It doesn't matter what income you make/these things are #free 
@RDonch and @megandoncsecz so proud of you both! 
Life isn't about #quotes about #life!  You actually gotta practice what you preach Or your just a #hypocrite.  Focus on you-not others.

I clean up the dust and sweep it out the door. Humming another one bites the dust-remembering that I'm the one who gets rid of garbage.
If I cut u off- chances are u handed me the scissors.
You don't deserve anything in life! Work for what you want!
Getting rid of people that are draining and drama filled doesn't mean your heartless-it means you prefer positivity around u! #winning

Rules for living happier- step 1: it's not your place to judge others! Focus on yourself and what you can control. 
The only way to #succeed is to NOT worry about what everyone else is doing.  Keep focused! Looking straight ahead will get you there!

Don't talk- just act.  Don't say- just show. Don't promise- just prove.

@ABtravelgirl @Eliseeverafter and so happy that it doesn't matter who notices!
@ABtravelgirl @Eliseeverafter don't even know the definition of give up or lazy or quitter.
Sometimes the only way to catch your breath is to lose it completely.
I believe coffee is my #spiritAnimal Thank you @Rdonch for the box of Joe today!
I won't get sidetracked by the people who are not on the track. Hecklers couldn't do half of what winners do! #vipstrong #winningteam
Reminder-when people cut you down or talk behind your back, remember they took the time out of their pathetic lives to talk about u #subtext
when people don't know whats going on in your life-they speculate. When they think they know-they fabricate. When they do know-they hate!
FACT--the more you love your decisions, the less you need others to love them.

Congrats to VIP's Megan Smith and Jason Grauf #WeddingWednesday married at @THEROYALPdC  
@megandoncsecz he is our mascot! He miss u too
@megandoncsecz teddy would like to book a package to the animal kingdom! #vipvacations 
@megandoncsecz look what I got in the mail! #prettygirlrock 
Winners train. Losers complain! U can't be awesome and negative at the same time! Choose 1!
Researchers have found that you could be immune from the #chickV virus! 
@BarackObama its depressing that my staff of under 35 yr olds only realize its Election Day Tuesday due 2 prerecorded phone calls!
Thanks 2 our friends @Karismahotels 4 coming up from #Mexico to visit VIP's pink palace. #DestinationWedding crew 
You can't be awesome an negative! You must choose one!
It's amazing what you can accomplish when you don't care who gets the credit!
The 1st step of getting what you want is getting rid of what you don't!
@megandoncsecz was with our guide Julio from Lomas last night and he asked for this quiz 
No matter what age u are. When u are sick all u want is your momma @megandoncsecz
@ABtravelgirl oh girl it is so true!  #bff #smartwomen
@megandoncsecz we miss u too!
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness-I'm kind 2 everyone but when someone is unkind 2 me, weak is not what u are gonna remember about me
@megandoncsecz u know this is me! #selfaware #cantsing #wronglyrics 
Thank u @karismahotels for the amazing dinner and visit. @sarahkue was honored by your presence. 
@jodi_harris sent u an email. Making sure u got it!?!
Changing perspective that people aren't against you, rather they are for themselves makes it less personal and easier to get over.
You are what you do not what you say you'll do.
Sometimes u don't realize your drowning when you are trying to be everyone else's anchor.
Be careful, everyone has a breaking point.
Please don't judge me-u couldn't handle half of what I have dealt with. There's a reason I do what I do and a reason why I am who I am!
Plot twist: time doesn't necessarily mean people will mature.
@rachgreenawalt @hajarbensaid_ missing Meg also means missing the girls who R like my adopted daughters. Let's get mani's over Thanksgiving
So proud of the relationship my daughter and I have @megandoncsecz Our closeness is so special and our daily morning convo's mean so much!
Assuming things can totally backfire, how does that make ya feel now? 
@cruise4unj I'll let u know!
@cruise4unj @ekf6189 we can create it!!
Gotta admit- this would be a fabulous t-shirt! Wonder if it comes in pink @ekf6189 #travelguru 
Being a #leader. #sacrifice #servanthood #teamwork 
Watch out for #karmasutra  It's when fate messes with u in all sorts of creative ways!
The highest reward for a person's work is not what they get for it, but what they become by it.
When u look at people who are successful, u will find that they aren't the people who are motivated but have consistency in their motivation
service and gratitude fuels EVERY relationship.  Entitlement and expectation spoils EVERY relationship.
If u are asked NOT to do something and u still do it- shouldn't I be upset?
@Leadershipfreak ugh I wish I read this at 9 am today!
Everything is easy, when u r crazy, and nothing is easy when u r lazy. So work 4 it and get what u deserve. Hardwork makes u lucky-not easy
U can't get everything u want. That's not how it works in this world. U have 2 choose 1 thing u want and sacrifice others.
Spent-a feeling u get when u have given everything and someone asks 4 more. But what if there's nothing left? Then true character appears!
Good lesson @megandoncsecz Message to my soulmate: if you ever pass by me please let me know because I'll probably be staring at my phone.
@Lbennett22 @BeachesResorts @megandoncsecz @rachgreenawalt @SarahSchannauer maybe for Meg's 20th!
#TBT good times #Jamaica @BeachesResorts @megandoncsecz @rachgreenawalt @Lbennett22 @SarahSchannauer
