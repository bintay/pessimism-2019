Eye just watched Devil is a Part Timer. It was short &amp; funny, not really that deep/engrossed though 
Great lookin out <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 

This shit dope
When you grow &amp; your surroundings dont - your surroundings change.
@Poetic_Feel moors aint in contract with anything/anyone. Basically, the major problem
@RawesomeKev whats a good anime eye needa peep bro
This is my dad 
Yesss they throw the book at moors simply because they know niggas dont innerstand this <PENSIVE FACE> 
@Poetic_Feel look into treaty laws for this here corporate country 
Gasp this changes everything bro 
@Poetic_Feel them niggas, like, contracts lol they can make treaties if the congress is cool with it but they don't mix em, if u notice
@Poetic_Feel the constitution itself forbids this damn country to enter into treaties/covenants cause they dont recognize international law
@Poetic_Feel look it up for yourself my friend. This country/corporation runs on the unlimited ability to contract. Everything is contract.
We should all watch the amish for like a year &amp; take notes
These trustees don't care about treaties because it makes them no money
When you cross the treaty of peace &amp; friendship with the constitution you just detonated a bomb, essentially
The united States of America does not honor the treaty of peace &amp; friendship.
The thing moors dont innerstand is that you cannot mix treaty law with contract law. It is suicide.

fuck this eyem finna read ezekiel again
Ezekiel's throne chariot is the cosmos in miniature, and the use of raqia' most likely refers to a solid canopy (it shines "like crystal")
"And gold leaf was hammered out..." (Ex. 39:3); and "beaten silver is brought from Tarshish" (Jer. l0:9).
The material beaten out is not directly specified, but both biblical and extra-biblical evidence suggests that it is metal.
The Hebrew word translated in the Latin Vulgate as firmamentum is raqia' whose verb form means "to spread, stamp or beat out."
The most striking feature of the Old Testament world is the "firmament," a solid dome which separates "the waters from the waters"

@MariahObama right! they keep telling us its a dome too but we miss the cues like a mf
Wait til eye get my websight up, eyem puttin ALLLLL this shit up there and fuck all the skeptical naysayers &amp; they damn colonized thoughts
The boundary between heaven and earth was a solid (perhaps tin) vault, and the earth was a flat disk. 
Eye feel so cheated here lol
He also placed a crystalline [firmament] round it, and put it together in a manner agreeable to the earth, and fitted it for giving moisture
No worries. 
STARS FIXED TO THE SURFACE LIKE NAILS HUH.
Greek philosopher Anaximenes described the heavens as like a felt cap that turned on its head, w the stars fixed to this surface like nails
Sumerian deities = An (god of heaven), Ki (goddess of earth), Enlil (god of the air, son of An and Ki) &amp; Enki (god of the primeval sea)
Even the damn Sumerians said there's a solid vault/dome. SOMEBODY LYYYYYINNNN
The stars, planets, sun, and moon were embedded in this solid vault.
he boundary between the primeval sea and the earth (a flat disk) was a solid vault, within which was the gas-like atmosphere.
duh. 
Sumerians believed that a primeval sea (abzu) existed before anything else &amp; that the heaven (an) &amp; the earth (ki) were formed within it.
and allowed water to leak through 'windows of heaven' or sluice gates to form clouds and rain."
The Bible says the earth was "flat and circular sitting on pillars w a rotating solid sky dome overhead which carried the Sun/Moon/Stars -
@Ebolawski we should link one weekend this month &amp; we can link with my fellow nerd @cerebralasasin1 to get some masculine perspective poppin

Eye seen this shit myself, thought my eyeballs were deceiving me
*NEW* Lunar Wave (Hologram?) &amp; The Moon Lie 
Once you lie, you lose your credibility. Everything you say after the lie is suspect.
If there was no validity to my claims, why are you so obsessed with me? Hmmm? lol
nigggaaaaa.
lol it just makes too much sense once you start pondering on it with an open mind! these mfs been flexxin us 
The moon doesnt move, not even a fraction of a damn degree, and that shit is sinister af
Daaaaaaamn this would explain how you can feel the moon innergy before its actually 'full' or even after. And, why the moon doesnt spin
The moon itself is probably 4th dimensional and not everyone can sea 4th dimensional shit so they gave us a hologram picture to put on top
This guy caught the moons image 'refresh' on cam! The moon we sea is definitely a holographic projection lol
Its called a 'refresh' where like the frames in the TV/Laptop are too fast for the camera, so you sea waves/distortion
You know like how you put a camera on a TV/Laptop screen &amp; you sea the waves going across it?
omg *faints &amp; wakes back up* you can literally sea the moon glitch in these videos lol
Eye seen this omg this was two days before my bearthday last year on blood moon!

Thick skin is so necessary when dealing with ignorant fucktards man

Eye could post pictures all day lol eye never really even researched effeminization until now &amp; eyem like, disturbed.
*blinks* 

no strong, noble, intelligent, race-conscious black man/woman will ever be famous or idolized in the system we have today.
... 
*shifty eyes*

In short, the black man‚Äôs role was to be but a lowly servant to protect the interest of the white supremacist. Uncle Tom of sorts.
This was done in order to make them reliable servants of the royal court. Today, in modern times, we have many eunuchs.
many eunuchs were African slaves who were caught, groomed and effeminized by wearing feminine clothes, make-up, perfume and jewelry.
That function was to be an asexual, non-threatening guard to the King‚Äôs Harem of Concubines.
Castration was typically carried out on the soon-to-be eunuch without his consent so that he might perform a specific social function.
This nigga &amp; his remedial directions though ._________________.
lol eye say aaahddress instead of address and peecan instead of pekhan
Eye aint the enemy but somebody wants me to be. Too bad eye suck at duality lol eye'd rather laugh &amp; watch you talk about me.
Exactly what it is lol everyone in the world needs to read that diabolical ass book. 
eyem simp, in my own, fuckin mind. a simp in my own fuckin mind, yes eyem
we watched it up close, first hand smh 
If u have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react against, your followers will tighten &amp; cohere. *coughs in hand &amp; looks around*
Manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you.
5. Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic. Make sure your followers believe they are part of an exclusive club, unified by a bond of common goals.
Followers will copy yo every move believing it will bring them the same results &amp; their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the truth.
4. Disguise Your Source of Income. Never reveal that your wealth comes from YO FOLLOWERS make it seem to come from the truth of your methods
To emphasize your gathering's quasi-religious nature, talk and act like a prophet.
Ask them for sacrifices (donations) that will fill your coffers and increase your power.
3. Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the Group 
Create rituals for your followers. Organize them into a hierarchy.
2. Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual.
Surround yourself with luxury, dazzle your followers with visual splendor.
Your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include the promise of something great and transformative.
5 Ways to Create a Cult
1. Keep It Vague
Attract attention, not thru actions which are too clear, but thru words, which are hazy &amp; deceptive
lmao he got me blocked too cause he love me &amp; he miss me so much he can barely stand it

precisely. screwed 13 ways to 5D without a clue lol 
The vibration never lies. It is imperative to boss up your own vibration so that you can calibrate vibrations around you with ease.
Truth dont care who tell it.
You can be a false teacher and not even know that what you are teaching is false.
@sugarflyshyy lol *dials 1-800-ANCESTORS*
We see them basic maneuvers. Fuck niggas running out of game because gurus training the queens to dodge lame niggas.
Pussy is a given. Dick is a given. What else you bringing to the table if all you talkin bout is "I love queens" all day.
To all the real men - Act like you seen a beautiful woman before. Put ya dick back in your pants.
Real men already know our women look good. They should be used to that level of beauty if they were truly spiritual. Not drooling over it.
Pay close attention to what people talk about the most. If he talks about how beautiful you are all day... He's mentally undressing you.
BEWARE these hotep niggas tryna fuck &amp; duck the rising queens by faking spirituality.
Pro tip to all rising queens - pay attention to those that put you on a pedestal.
Many folks want attention from being wise but dont put in the work necessary to actually, BE, wise. Difference between a teacher &amp; a guru.
Everyone has the potential but many are scared to fail thinking they have lost before they even began. They aren't growing. No growth shows.
Eye've been wrong more times than most people have even made attempts.
lmaoooo 
Wisdom is applicable knowledge. When speaking to a wise person, you can take the lesson and apply it right then to gain your own wisdom.
Difference is you can know all there is to know about cars. Doesn't make you a good driver. Practical wisdom always trumps knowledge.
Intelligence is knowing how to build the car. Wisdom is telling you how it drives and handles from experience.
the difference between self wisdom and intelligence. Intelligence is memorization but experience is wisdom.
Can't stop the planets from orbiting. Regardless of what you believe. Interpretations can be altered. But the planets themselves can't.
When everything in earth is wrong - The stars aren't. No human made the stars. Therefore humans can't control them or alter them.
Know how the planets move, know what's bout to go down.
Not everyone innerstands things the same way. Some people need pictures and parables. That's all religion is, at its core.
All religion is, is Vedic Astrology. All the stories and myths are teaching tools.
@CatherineGibeau bitch eye will fucking slap the shit out of you, dont you ever.
lol yap &amp; honesty makes you enemy of the state, eye already know how it go 
neither, where the pussy at. eyem placin my faith whereverrr the pussy is at ^_^ vesica piscis activists for tha win

Self biography has to be one of my weakest points lol how can eye take something so expansive as ME &amp; put it into a biography? Niggaaaa
If you want to know whats going on, on this planet, you have to know know whats going on in the stars/planets. As below, so above.
None but ourselves can free our minds. Have no fear for atomic energy, 'Cause none of them can stop the time.
Only we can free our minds. This is what we are here for. To make the old way of thinking obsolete.
@SupremeDanielXx frickin epic babe how about you
Eye hate peeing in the toilet. Shit makes me feel guilty as fuck. What a total waste of water smh
hay 
*wiggles eyebrows* 
All this logic and explanation is a long winded way of getting to the point - We love each other, and we can't communicate it well enough.
We got to sit down and call each other by name and tell each other we love each other. That's the only thing truly missing. We miss love.
Ancestors didn't live and die just to pass down bullshit. The sooner we listen to our ancestors, the sooner we can unite. Period.
Bob Marley said keep all them damn isms &amp; skisms but we aint even listen.
now THAT, is epic. trees are like the alchemical cabinet lol how was it?! 
It worked like a charm too, because our people try to be SO LOGICAL now that its painful to watch.
Strip us naked, strip our culture, divide our people, but you can keep the bible &amp; you can keep logic. you can keep "scholarly" wisdom. TUH
Anything with an "-ism" is a logical brainwashing tool. Otherwise, why would they let us keep it? They take everything but "logic" from us?
logic says - if you want to cripple a culture - scatter their heritage (miseducation/strip their religion). Divide the men/women - feminism
Lets not trip lol wasnt no colleges or grade schools or none of that shit around here before. CLEARRRLLLYYYY lol
lol how dope would that be, to travel thru a plants roots as water *squirms with excitement* oh man eye gotta do it 
That school shit is some european bullshit they used to mentally trap an entire nation of people. Low key.
truth was passed down in the genes, NEVER written down on paper and taught in schools.
Truth, motherfuckin, avoidance.
We are a race of Mind - We created the sciences that begot logic, out of nothing. Wonder why everyone is confused? They avoid the truth.
And you monkey mouf motherfuckers have the audacity to say we are illogical. Our ancestors didn't use logic because we aren't creatures.
Logic has managed to fuck up the air, poison the water, GMO'd all the food, made plants illegal, and made ancient science taboo.
Our ancestors didn't die protecting our science just to hear their descendants talmbout some "logic" nigga.
However, s/he who aligns with the Ancients and their wisdom becomes Mentally Superior as they inherited wisdom from generations of Ancestors
If it was easy, there would be no value - hence all this pseudo-enlightenment out here.
Only fools stop when they find Fool's Gold, as they aren't wise enough to innerstand true Gold is never that easy to come by.
so epic! eyem tryna shrink down to water molecules &amp; jump in the ocean &amp; get squirted out of a dolphins blowhole lol 
Truth is like Gold. If you want it, you have to dig relentlessly and don't quit. Do it long enough, you are deemed worthy and get the gold.
Since all things vibrate, then all things are made of consciousness, or the mind.
Similarly, anything that vibrates has consciousness in it (not necessarily self-consciousness).
How do you make fire hot, or how do you make water wet. You don‚Äôt. Fire itself is heat, and water is wetness.
Consciousness itself is vibration.
All objects in the universe are vibration. There are no atoms, no molecules, no electrons, no anything of any kind that is solid.
Circles and cycles
This is how eye distinguish observant people from not so observant people. You observe more when your vibration increases/expands/raises
It can parcel itself into as many different parts as are needed to see as many objects as possible that it wants to see.
The mind is unlimited. The mind is infinite.
The mind can vibrate parts of itself at many diff speeds, matching the vibration of each object, so we can sea many objects at the same time
Each object has its own unique speed of vibration; that‚Äôs what separates objects from each other.
When eyem inside a room looking at the objects, my consciousness vibrates at the same speed as all the objects eye sea.
Make it make it, vibrate.
Now, if all matter is vibration, and comes from the mind, how do you make the mind, or consciousness, vibrate in the first place?
Ancestors be like 'but you dont hear me though' cause you really dont hear em though lol vibration too bogged down with fuckery
when we reach total cosmic unity we hear all the songs of the universe simultaneously, meaning we perceive all things by being all vibration
Everything that we see is vibrating at the same speed as some part of our conscious mind &amp; whatevr we don‚Äôt see is vibrating at a diff speed
‚ÄúEverything in the universe has a rhythm, everything dances." - Maya Angelou
Our mind is unlimited. There is no limit to the number of ‚Äòsongs‚Äô we can ‚Äòhear‚Äô at the same time.
Our perception is a ‚Äòschool‚Äô of symphonies, bringing together many different songs so that we can perceive many objects simultaneously
When we synchronize consciousness vibrations w/ the vibration of a object, then the two vibrations have the same speed &amp; we see the object
lol damn yo *mind blown* 
Synchronization of vibration means our consciousness also vibrates. A good analogy of how consciousness perceives is use of a strobe light
There is not any kind of permanently solid matter. All is vibration, and the vibration appears to our senses as something solid.
All senses uses synchronization of vibration in order to see. All objects are actually vibrations, physically speaking.
CharMagnetic.
Magnetic attraction.
We have no form, we have nothing. We just are. Eternally observing. Forever watching. We ARE ALL things.
We predate Time, we predate the brain that is used to form these weak ass theories. We predate the creation of this universe.
Consciousness is all that exists. There is no time, no space, just you.
Lucy time travel scene 
Eye cannot believe what eye just watched here.

MESSAGE.  
the illusion of separation is only present when spirit breathes life into it.
If the projection was by the eyes you'd sea 2 separate holes like looking thru binoculars. Nope. You see a continuous image like widescreen.
All the light entering the eyes hit the back of the brain and appear as your sense of vision.
Poke holes in a sheet of paper. Get any light source, put the paper over it. There you have your stars.
You'll see stars projected in 3D space from a 2D surface. Hologram. Projection of consciousness.
@_WaningGibbous that link is about the beings piloting the moon but eyema send you the eye in the sky vid when eye get on my laptop

The thing is a thing. Not what is said of that thing.
The oldest mention of a horned deity starts with Nimrod, El, and Moloch. 
As a god worshiped by the Phoenicians and Canaanites, Moloch had associations w a particular kind of propitiatory child sacrifice by parents
Symbolism is a truly international form of communication, for it bypasses the barriers of language, race and culture.
The Hebrew letters ◊û◊ú◊ö (mlk) usually stand for melek "king"
lol crazy af 
a symbol has the power to evoke and influence our actions on a conscious and unconscious level
Could we say that america is hathor gone wild ...? or nah
a woman's sacrifice.
lol jokes on jokes on jokes ^_^

Learn from the collective experience from ALL beings on the planet.

Eye was gone change my number a few days ago, then my nigga called me from the feds so eye aint changin shit now. free my nigga Larry.
The left &amp; right brain are both necessary to drive your chariot ^_^ need dual thrusters to power up
The lower half of the body could be the snake &amp; the upper half of the body could be the bird. hmm.
Motion and no motion. Ha, nommo.
Cycles fits in with my flat earth theory too lol
You yourself distributes power/energy. Someone is sucking up all of that power/energy.
All of the religious customs &amp; creeds are only saying ONE thing - LET ME HAVE YOUR POWER.
exactly. bi-ble is two bulls, they tell you where that book is goin off gate lol straight to deuce deuce duality 
Either we all get the credit, or none of us gets the credit. We all play a part.
@L0VEST0NE eye got gemineye sun &amp; rising lol my haters call me hermaphrodite
The illusionary worlds on the tree of life.
The realer you keep it with yourself, the more you collapse duality &amp; the easier it is to sea yourself and sea others, as part of yourself.
Humbling myself to myself.
Harmonic convergence via polar opposites.
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. The bible itself says to run from duality.
Actuality sounds ridiculous so the dualistic mind.
All of the things the opposition distracts us with, is really just to deter us from learning these epic universal lessons.
Eyem honored my friend eye appreciate you! Eye love KNefer too lol he too legit with it 
snapchat me eatin healthy if ever, wheneverrrr you actually start doin it *grins with delight*  
All elements must come back to serve themselves.
lol we dont starve nigga we refine our diets like real niggas do 
Once you find the center, you's ascended master, straight buddha status, flexxin in real time/the moment
Its like starting at the edge of the disk where you're disoriented, imbalanced and polarized &amp; utilizing tools/lessons to find the center
Thats why eye think this earth is disk shaped, its too obvious that we're running a track of experiences, trying to get to the center
This is a big universal disk of lessons. If you dont pass it the first time, you're going to repeat the same lesson, over &amp; over.
thats what eyem talkin bout! w00t w00000t 
Two eyes for duality/illusion. One eye for actuality/wholeness.
you sure as hell do nigga 
When you fuse 'positive' and 'negative' you get - actuality.
Tell your skeleton Thank Youuuu ^_^ Thank you bones
The Us vs. Them mentality will always keep the people under dominion.
Illusions always function on duality.
Emotions can take you out of the moment and into the past/future. Masters must always remain present - in the moment.
When the words are backwards, the worlds are backwards. The actions are backwards.
Administer piece by piece, with care.
Dont give it all away, that depreciates the value of whats being given.
Creating things in love, for each other.
Expressions of love
Libra is the masculine expression of venus, taurus being the feminine expression.

@13MilesSoL13 thats what eyem here for my friend
When you start lookin at the sawdust in my eye and ignoring that mothafuckin plank in your eye, is when eye get irate &amp; insanely rude
The things that do bother me are unfairness or imbalance, complaining, finger pointing, holier than thou fuckery, and whine bag/cry babies
The angrier people get, the funnier eye think shit is. Eye think everything is funny man eye'm the queen at laughing out of turn
lol thats me, all day 
Everything around me could be falling to pieces &amp; eyed grab my teddy bear like 'well at least he's happy, fuck it eyem happy too nigga' lol
Eyem very diplomatic too. And PROactive. Eye try to avoid reaction like the plague but that doesnt always work lol
Eye noticed that eyem the most calm person eye actually know. Most people fake calm, but dont really be calm at all lol
Eye got one of those 'even if its fucked up now, its gonna get better later' type of attitudes lol its all good in the hood with me
Eye got libra moon according to my conception chart. Eyem always calm, cool, collected, rather animated, but happy-go-lucky &amp; optimistic af
lol hmm do you bring about the balance? thats a sign of true moon in libra, they the balance makers 
Zodiac Characteristics - Vedic 
Saturn - order, discipline, judge, jury, boundaries, stern teacher, grim/great reaper

The moon sign in your chart is definitely the most important since moon = mind &amp; represents emotions

Wherever you're going, eye'm going your way.
Instead of masking the truth with humor, take a risk and acknowledge your vulnerability.
we are best served by letting go of fixed perspectives to make room for new and improved ones.
same here sis 
Something new is coming. Make your life ready for it. Then unleash your imagination, and summon it.
we are our surface and our depth- but we don‚Äôt want to confuse the former with the latter.
observe the cause instead of sifting through the effects
not everything is what it seems and that to really innerstand something you have to get to the roots and not just stay on the surface.
teachers cheaters
Eyem a master learner
My homies eat bell peppers like apples, whatchu know bout it
Nisargadatta &amp; Rumi are my two ultimate favorites.
‚Äú‚ÄôBoth Light and Shadow are the dance of Love‚Äù -Rumi
delve into the shadows to seek the gold (realizations) that will help you to navigate further on your path of healing and wholeness
‚ÄòWisdom tells me I am nothing. Love tells me I am everything. Between the two my life flows.‚Äô -Nisargadatta Maharaj
Anchoring into/expressing more fully our gifts/originality/creativity and our Inner Sun/Divine Self is key
True confidence emerges when there‚Äôs nothing to fear - within or without.
Instead of checking out, we gain soul power by withstanding and being creative where we can in the face of adversity.
It‚Äôs timely for purging the excess and getting rid of whatever takes you off your center.
lmaoooo my thoughts aint yo thoughts bitch! cut that bitch off, next caller 
absolutely my dear 
Eye doubt the sun &amp; moon are spherical. More NWO propaganda.
Eye say we add re-legion to the boycott list, cause this is depressing. 
Earth energies show us how to keep it real, by being awake to what‚Äôs going on around us
@universouluv timebreaker 
@universouluv 
If 'alive' means 'moving' then, everything is 'alive'
disengage from what‚Äôs draining us and stripping away needless drama as we fortify ourselves for the challenges ahead.
This fool talmbout 'poverty pacquiao &amp; melanated mayweather' lol smh aint no business like show business

What you're calling the future, is really the past.
Great complexity.
Infinitude. Contacting yourself from the future/past. Days of future past.
World builders. Word builders.
The strongest mind wins.

Heavy levels of language encryption. Words to build worlds.
Crack the riddles that bind together worlds.
Trying to figure out who's right &amp; who's wrong, you miss the entire play.
One tradition clones another tradition, they adapt cultures that have proven power.
In the beginning was the word. The words created the worlds.
Some words shatter other words if you innerstand the tones/vibrations.
God is not the highest title that you can get. Thats the trickery.
Some words hold more power (energy) more than others. Some words crash worlds. Other words build worlds.
The back &amp; forth that goes on in the mind. The constant humming.
Speak your own edicts and decrees.
"they" is a scapegoat. Step into your own being &amp; take responsibility by breaking all spells that you have spoken on yourself.
Planets. Planned nets.
Words create worlds. Illusions.
