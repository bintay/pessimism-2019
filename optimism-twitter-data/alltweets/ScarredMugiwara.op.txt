@TangerinePirate "Woooo birthday adventure!!!", he threw his arms up into the air full of excitement.
@Optimistic_Gon "Try to get the day to last forever. I like birthdays."
@Optimistic_Gon "Shishishi! I'm going to eat till I explode today! What about you?"

@Optimistic_Gon "Happy birthday Gon!"
@TangerinePirate "Yahoo! Nami's letting me be myself!", he grinned as wide as his rubber face could muster.
@TangerinePirate "I'm an adult! I don't need a babysitter!"
@TangerinePirate "Are you sure you want to come with?", his legs continued walking as he body stayed in Nami's grip.
@TangerinePirate "Shishishi you'll see!", he snickered as he slung his arms behind his head while walking off.
"Where's my presents!!?"
@TangerinePirate "I guess I'll have to do something drastic."
@TangerinePirate "...Let's not get too hasty.", his face went to a very pale shade at the though of Zoro's outstanding debts.
@TangerinePirate -give me some money to spend on meat."
@TangerinePirate "I'm the captain. I do more than enough work.", he began to pick his nose as he spoke to the navigator. "You should just-
@TangerinePirate "I want to get three times more meat at the next island. Sanji's not giving me enough for my growing body."
"Aiiie so huuuuungry!"
@TangerinePirate "How broke are we?", he asked as he slithered down the mast in a rather disturbing manner.
"Oi, Nami!", Luffy howled from atop the crow's nest of the Thousand Sunny down to @TangerinePirate.
@navigatorgod "Shishishi.", Luffy dove forward onto the table to devour the meat that was there. "Awesome! Delicious!"
@navigatorgod Like the savage man that he was Luffy began to drool over the simple passing word 'meat'. 
@navigatorgod "Hmm, I stuck the pepper shakers in my nose to make a funny face. Then I sneezed them out, while screaming in the kitchen..."
@navigatorgod "He's not cooking me anything, so there's no reason to be around him right now."
@navigatorgod "Sooooo booooooring.", Luffy moaned in the most groansome manner he could muster.
@navigatorgod "Looking for everyone.", he stated the obvious as he folded his arms in front of his chest.
"Oi! Where is everyone!!"
"All this time away made me hungry." 
"Oi, I'm back." 
@ViceWarden @AnetteRaven "Sabo you have a good woman here! She laughs a lot! That's almost as good as being able to cook! Almost."
@ViceWarden @AnetteRaven "I can be pretty comical."
@ViceWarden @AnetteRaven "Sabo's gonna be a dad!" 
@ViceWarden @AnetteRaven "Having the Pirate king for an uncle is totally awesome. This kid's gonna be so lucky!" 
@ViceWarden @AnetteRaven "You're having a kid? ...Eh!? You're gonna be a dad?!"
@LegacyOfOhara //Protip on JFK he was fucking Russian bitches since the first grade. Hit it and quit it style like a cold motha fucka.

"Do I always sleep through entire weekends? Oh well."
@SaikyouKenshi @UsoppsFables @Peronashi "We're dealing with a mighty nosemancer here!"

@LazyKuzan Luffy uses his encased arm to block the flung blocks of ice. "I'm just getting (cont) 
@LazyKuzan "Gomu Gomu no...", Luffy throws his fist out at Kuzan aiming for his face. "...Pistol!"
@LazyKuzan "Sounds fun, but on principle I won't go easy on you.", he says with a large smirk.
@LazyKuzan "Damn straight! I'll keep on fighting till I'm at the top!" 
@LazyKuzan "Whatever it takes to become pirate king!"
@UsoppsFables @Peronashi The slow motion act lasted a mere eternity in his eyes. At the first sign (cont) 
@RaitoTeitoku @MonkeyDLuffyko "I know you... You're one of those marine guys."
@Peronashi @UsoppsFables "Usopp no!!", Luffy threw his hand out dramatically towards his friend.
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Shishishi", Luffy mimicked her with his own laugh.
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Woohoo! Nakama!" 
@Peronashi @UsoppsFables "Not until you release control over Usopp's nose!"
@LazyKuzan "Yo.", Luffy lifts his hand up.
@ChivalrousCook "He's renting space from Nami.", he points to @Optimistic_Gon. "Where's my food Sanji?"
@BebopBang "I do too. I'm using my abilities to allow my friends to have a good time."

@Optimistic_Gon "Get @ChivalrousCook to make you some soup."
@Optimistic_Gon "That's a bad cough you got there Gon.", he nods at the guy with his arms crossed.
@MonkeyDLuffyko "You become my nakama!" 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "You're the coolest cause you are me!" 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "You're the best parallel universe me I have ever met!!", Luffy drools at the sight before diving into the meat pile.
@MonkeyDLuffyko 
"Luffyko is so cool"
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Doesn't matter having a gender swapped sister is awesome!" 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "It's almost like we're a gender swapped version of each other... This is too much thinking for me." 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Huh, yeah I did! You did too?"
@MonkeyDLuffyko As Luffyko goes Gear Second Luffy swings his reared back fist aiming for her meat loving face.
@TangerinePirate "Ancient Tandem Hunting Bears might?", Luffy said in a questioning manner as he poked the ruby like egg with his finger.
@Heavenly__Demon "Fine, but do you have any food to replace the meat you knocked away?"
@Heavenly__Demon "Phew I stopped.", Luffy wiped his brow of sweat. "So that must mean we're true friends, eh Doffy?", he grinned widely.
@Heavenly__Demon "I CAN'T!!", he yells crashing through priceless irreplaceable items. "THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP ME IS TRUE FRIENDSHIP!"
@Heavenly__Demon "I'M REALLY CLUMSY!!", Luffy howls as he begins bouncing off of the walls gaining momentum to break more nice things.
@GuyWithSwords //Yes yes he is.
@Heavenly__Demon Luffy feels the possession release and goes to chase after Doflamingo only to slip (cont) 
@Heavenly__Demon "Baka! Baka! Baka!", Luffy shouts as he takes each step furthering himself from Doflamingo.
@Heavenly__Demon "Hey what the-!?", Luffy's body obeys the hand and turns about. "Get back here, Baka! Baka!"
@Heavenly__Demon "I'm rubber you're glue, whatever you say slips off of me and sticks to you!" 
@Heavenly__Demon "You wanna scrap you rubber racist!?", Luffy returns his shove with a shove of his own.
@GuyWithSwords //Matthew Perry would be hysterical as Zoro
@Heavenly__Demon "It smelt just fine. You just have shit taste!", Luffy grits his teeth as he barks back.
@Heavenly__Demon "M-my meat! Why'd you do that!? It was only a couple of days old!", Luffy howled getting all up in Doflamingo's face.
@Heavenly__Demon "Aww c'mon Doflamingo, I'll let you have some of my meat.", Luffy (cont) 
@thepiratempress "My only problem is that I don't have any food in my belly."
@Optimistic_Gon "Shishishi, in that case welcome to the crew for good!", Luffy wraps his arm around Gon's neck.
@TangerinePirate "But I want to eat bear now!", Luffy began to argue back with her as the (cont) 
@thepiratempress "Like what? I don't have any problems."
@Optimistic_Gon "Nah she'll probably make you pay the 300 percent, I just have Captain perks."
@Heavenly__Demon "What about me Doflamingo? I thought we were friends!"
@Optimistic_Gon "She tells me that all the time! I usually just don't listen to her.", he laughs at @TangerinePirate for being so basic.
@UsoppsFables @Peronashi "You can't just call people a liar Peronanana... Unless you're calling Usopp a liar."
@Optimistic_Gon "I'm here Gon. I haven't seen you around the ship that much."
@UsoppsFables @Peronashi "Did she? Is she- Is she callin' me a liar?"
@MeganeTaisa "Hey you're the lady that hangs out with that smokey guy."
//Mention me for an RP I've got nothing important to do this morning.
"I need a nap, but first I need meat." 
#SeductiveSunday 
@UsoppsFables "Right!", Luffy began to wrap his arms around @Peronashi in a constricting fashion. "Don't blow up Usopp's nose!!"
@Peronashi @UsoppsFables Luffy notices her incoherent mumbling, "Ah Usopp she's casting a spell on your nose!"
@Peronashi @UsoppsFables "Don't be mean to Usopp the nose is what makes him special in his own unique way!"
"I'd sooner eat my own nose!!"
@TangerinePirate "What do you mean? The jewel's over there...", he points to another (cont) 
//I know she's probably being sarcastic but man everything in that post is true.
@JeansKennedy "That's the name of the treasure in the Grand Line!"
@JeansKennedy "Well hey there! Wait... You know my name?" 
@Heavenly__Demon //As long as Tom Cruise is Luffy I'm okay with it.

@_SnakePrincess " Awh well okay then.." 
@_SnakePrincess "Sparring? I'm always up for a good throwdown!"

@DLuffyr "That's awesome it's like a little me!"
@KaisokuGariZoro @TangerinePirate @ChivalrousCook "Yeah look at me!", Luffy exclaimed at her. "What're we talking about again?"
@Optimistic_Gon @TangerinePirate "Hmmm Luffy placed a hand on his upside down chin. "Well okay! Welcome aboard Gon!"
@TangerinePirate @Optimistic_Gon "You called?", Luffy's head comes down like a hanging spider to speak with the two.
@DLuffyr "You look like a little me!"
@TangerinePirate @ChivalrousCook @KaisokuGariZoro "Yes. I am most definitely not a "cape coat"." 
@TangerinePirate "Did you find it yet?", Luffy walked up dragging the dead creature behind him with little to no effort at all.
@KaisokuGariZoro @ChivalrousCook @TangerinePirate "Girls' clothes.~", Luffy stayed starry eyed even with all of the anger in the air.
@KaisokuGariZoro @ChivalrousCook @TangerinePirate 
@ThePirateDawn @ChivalrousCook "Yay food!", Luffy say down and began slurping up the meal (cont) 
@_SnakePrincess Luffy brings his lips down to hers, pausing mere millimeters away.

@ThePirateDawn @ChivalrousCook "Sanji get up and fix some food! We're hungry and starving!", Luffy rants at the chef.
@_SnakePrincess "Only true loves first kiss can bring her back from her faint spell.~"
@ThePirateDawn @ChivalrousCook "Hmm? Yeah it's always like this more or less!", Luffy grins widely to the girl.
@TangerinePirate "Hmm? It's over there where we were running from.", Luffy points to the (cont) 
@_SnakePrincess "Hancock!?", Luffy catches the woman in his arms dropping down to one knee.
@ThePirateDawn @ChivalrousCook "Sanji! I want my food now!", Luffy ranted and raved behind the two as Sanji tried to work his magic.
@_SnakePrincess "What's wrong Hancock? Should I check your temperature?" 
"Hancock's making some weird faces today. I wonder what she's thinking about?"
@_SnakePrincess "Are you okay Hancock?" 
@_SnakePrincess "We're not getting married."

@Med_Dealer "Where is it Chopper!?", Luffy yelled as he deflated flying around the room.
@SoulOfZangetsu "Says the guy with the show full of pretty boys."

NO PHAT BEAT!!", Luffy began to smack that ass all on the floor as the rhythm went so hard the house's very foundation shook at this (2/3)
@Med_Dealer "Right...", Luffy replied as he bit into his thumb. "Gear Third!", he blew his hands up to extraordinary size. "GOMU GOMU (1/3)
@Med_Dealer "Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna get it up!", Luffy began to spank harder using his buns like a bongo drum.
@ThePirateDawn @ChivalrousCook "An older captain eh...", Luffy turns to Sanji looking him in the eye. "I'm hungry."
@ThePirateDawn @ChivalrousCook "Young?", Luffy begins to look himself over for something indicating that he was young.
@ChivalrousCook @ThePirateDawn "Sanji! Food!", Luffy puffed out his chest demanding delicious items for him to ingest.
@ThePirateDawn "C'mon it's here!", Luffy calls out to her as he runs up onto the deck of the Thousand Sunny "Oi, @ChivalrousCook! Feed me!"
@ThePirateDawn "The best around that's for sure!", he says with a large grin. "There's the ship! Foood!", Luffy begins to run to the Sunny.
@ThePirateDawn "The best around! He's a skeleton!", Luffy laughed stretching his face out like a scary skeleton.
@ThePirateDawn "Yeah! Brook would love more people dancing to his music!"
@ThePirateDawn "Yeah, but more friends mean more fun right?", Luffy smiled back at her comment.
@ThePirateDawn "Hmm I never thought of that... maybe I'll let you join.", Luffy snickered at the girl.
@ThePirateDawn "Including me?", Luffy throws up nine fingers. "Nine!", he grinned widely as they walked.
@ThePirateDawn "Yeah probably in the kitchen!", Luffy grinned at her turning around to face the direction of the ship. "Let's go!"
@ThePirateDawn "Yeah he's the best cook in all the seas!", Luffy complimented the chef with every pun intended. "We should have him feed us"
@ThePirateDawn "I wish Sanji had packed me a lunch.", Luffy began to ponder all of the delicious things he could be eating.
@RealLuffy //That's the most ignorantly ghetto response I could have ever heard.
@RealLuffy //That's another thing why do you save people's writer pics? It's creepy as fuck.
@RealLuffy //I role play all the time unlike you who does nothing but insult people and talk mad shit on the internet.
@RealLuffy //Why don't you actually role-play on your account instead of act like an internet tough guy?
@RealLuffy 
@RealLuffy 
//Man the Troll Hat Pirates are fucking retarded.
//I'll sell my soul for rubber man powers.
//Can I be Luffy IRL now? 
@ThePirateDawn "Yeah like wise. So you got anything to eat?", he cocked his head patting his stomach.
@Heavenly__Demon "Bwah! Pirate vanish!", Luffy throws down a piece of meat that wasn't really a piece of meat, but a smokescreen bomb.
@Heavenly__Demon "What a nerd!"
@TangerinePirate "Woo raspberries!", Luffy throws his hands up and runs out of the room.
@TangerinePirate "It's punishment."
[Blows raspberries in his crew mates @KaisokuGariZoro @TangerinePirate @UsoppsFables @ChivalrousCook @Med_Dealer and @OharasLegacy bellies]
@ThePirateDawn "Yo.", Luffy lifted his hand up and greeted the girl properly.
@ThePirateDawn "Well I guess it doesn't matter, who are you anyway?", Luffy questioned her watching her actions.
@ThePirateDawn "Who's he?", Luffy tilted his head at her.
Luffy turns to the dissipating  @DesertLaSpada, "Party pooper." Luffy shrugs turning back to @ThePirateDawn, "Oh yeah like what?"
@ThePirateDawn "No that's me.", Luffy said with a grin as he threw his arm out to drag @DesertLaSpada back into the conversation. "See."
@ThePirateDawn @DesertLaSpada "I'm called a lot of things usually pest or bastard."
@ThePirateDawn @DesertLaSpada "Hey I saw you with Law while he was doing that weird surgery stuff!"
@DesertLaSpada @ThePirateDawn "Am I interrupting something?", Luffy slowly makes his way away from the two.
@ThePirateDawn @DesertLaSpada "Crocodile!", Luffy leaped over bringing the man in for a light hug. "Hail Hydra."
@TrafalgarLaw440 @ThePirateDawn "Law always gets to have all the fun! Somebody get me up there I want to fight too!!"
@TrafalgarLaw440 @ThePirateDawn @Heavenly__Demon "Right!... How do I do that now?" 
//My feelings on the fact that I can't have my hat.

@ChivalrousCook Luffy rubbed the top of his head. "We can just get more right?" 
@ChivalrousCook "Noo?", Luffy rolls his eyes looking the other way away from Sanji.

@Heavenly__Demon "Huh, nothing... Later Doflamingo."
@KaisokuGariZoro "I'm not saying I have a problem..." 
@Heavenly__Demon "We did it in your bed.~", Luffy mumbles to himself.
@StrawHatShefu "HOW DARE YOU! I AM A TENDER LOVER JUST ASK HER!", Luffy points to the blushing meat.
@KaisokuGariZoro "Zoro there's plenty of other foods in the sea."
@Heavenly__Demon "You seem interested. So I'll say this once. Stay away from my meat."
@KaisokuGariZoro "More for me.~"
@StrawHatShefu "SANJI YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND!! WHAT WE HAVE IS SPECIAL!!", Luffy screamed as the meat blushed some more.
[What really goes on in Luffy's DMs.] 
@ChivalrousCook "I have no idea what you're talking about Sanji..." 
@IOrihime1 "That's a funny face! Let me try one!", Luffy began to make faces at the girl. 
@BonesAndPanties "You think so!?", Luffy grinned widely back up to Brook from the deck.
@BonesAndPanties "Woooo! So awesome!", Luffy exclaimed still face down arms raised high in the air.
@BonesAndPanties Luffy slid on his knees in front of Brook halting from the friction and plowing face first into the deck. "That was great!"
@BonesAndPanties "A night of meat would be the best treat, to make any meal absolutely (cont) 
@BonesAndPanties "Meat Meat, how it is so sweet. Meat Meat, it's what I want to eat!", Luffy dances around as he sings aloud.
@IOrihime1 "That's a weird compliment, but thanks anyway!"
@BonesAndPanties "Oi, Brook! I wrote a song!!"
@TangerinePirate "Fine let's go deeper into the cavern!!", Luffy exclaimed turning around moving towards the impending darkness.
@IOrihime1 "Meat meat meat meat! That is what I'd like to eat!", Luffy sang a song trying to imitate a certain boney crew mate of his.
@IOrihime1 "Back atcha! So you got any food with you?" 
@IOrihime1 Luffy lookes over to the red-headed girl who introduced herself. "Oi, I'm Luffy."
@ChivalrousCook "What!?", Luffy spazzed out in front of his meal. "How are we out!? We just got food!!"
@ChivalrousCook "Fine...", Luffy said as he waited anxiously for the plate to be set (cont) 
@MonkeyDLuffyko @Optimistic_Gon "Here I come!", Luffy runs at her with an arm cocked back readied to let it fly forward at a moment's notice
@Optimistic_Gon "Look there's a place up ahead!", Luffy shouts as the duo of hungry stomachs enter the establishment.
@ChivalrousCook "Foood!!", Luffy runs around the corner on all fours slipping on the hard wood floors.
@MonkeyDLuffyko @Optimistic_Gon "I hope you're ready for a smack down femme me!"
@Optimistic_Gon "Meat! And for dessert meat!", Luffy exclaimed happily.
@Optimistic_Gon "I like your thinking Gon!", Luffy paraded excitedly with Gon towards wherever the food was.
@Optimistic_Gon "Now to make this friendship official. Let's chow down!!" 
@Optimistic_Gon "Monkey D. Luffy, nice ta meet cha!" 
@Optimistic_Gon "Great! I've been wandering around forever... who are you by the way?", he looked to him quizzically.
"Hey do you know where I can find food in this town?", Luffy asked as he walked up to @Optimistic_Gon.
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Why don't we find out." 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "You smell like me!!", Luffy throws his hands up as well with the same wide grin.
@SuperMasterAsia To become the king of pirates!!
@FrankyCybort "Where have you been though? We need you around the Sunny.", Luffy asked tilting his head after finishing that sweet pose.
@FrankyCybort "I'm doing... SUUUUPER!!!" 
@FrankyCybort "Yo Franky!", Luffy waved to him with his wide grin.

@Med_Dealer "Meat!!", Luffy runs off ahead of Chopper bursting through the door of the shop.
@Med_Dealer "Since when does meat hide from being eaten!?" 
@Med_Dealer Luffy followed Chopper's trend and made a huge mess of the place trying to keep up.
@Med_Dealer "Lead the way to the meat!!" 
@Med_Dealer Luffy's mouth watered onto Chopper's hat as they left the ship to an unfamiliar port town. "Chopper smell us out some food!"
@Med_Dealer "Chopper! Let's get food!", Luffy exclaimed to the small blue nosed reindeer.

"I see it's getting hot and steamy on the ship... I'll just be here with my waifus." 
@OharasLegacy Luffy now sporting a red flush across his face, waved his hand beckoning the barkeep to bring more sake.
@OharasLegacy "Damn I won't go down so easily this time!!", he finishes off the bottle feeling all loosey goosey now.
@OharasLegacy "Before or after you?", Luffy looked at her quizzically from around the bottle as the liquid poured into his mouth.
@OharasLegacy "I don't remember losing!", Luffy proclaimed as he quickly began to chug his next bottle.

@TangerinePirate "Yes. I truly believe this." 
@OharasLegacy "Well whatever! Time to drink!", Luffy went on raising the bottle to his lips beginning to chug.

@OharasLegacy "We're docked so let's go out to drink this time!" 
@OharasLegacy "Robin! You up for another round of drinking?!",Luffy asks as he stretches his head into the conversation.
@TangerinePirate "What do we need a key for when I've got...", Luffy strains for a moment before revealing his extremity. "Key hand!"

@TangerinePirate "That thing?", Luffy walked past her tossing the head aside haphazardly. (cont) 
@TangerinePirate @BonesAndPanties "Cause Brook is the musician. He makes music"

@SaikyouKenshi @DesertLaSpada @Heavenly__Demon "I enjoy the time we all spend together."

@PrincessDesert_ "Anytime Vivi!!" 
@TangerinePirate Luffy knocks on Nami's door. "Do you want to build a snowman?"
@portgas_gold 



Usopp salutes the flying skeleton.
"All 8000 of my followers commend you for being a go…
@BonesAndPanties @UsoppsFables "Fly free brave musician, for your tunes will play forever in hearts."

"OH WAIT! I DON'T HAVE EYES! YOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!" 
@LightAdmiral @UsoppsFables //OOOOO NOOO YOU JUST TRYIN TA MAKE IT LIKE THAT TA FEEL BETTER BOUT YOSELF!!
@UsoppsFables Luffy follows Usopp with a giggle. "I can't wait to see his face... skull."
@BonesAndPanties 
@UsoppsFables "Hmm let's play a prank on Brook!"
@BonesAndPanties @TangerinePirate As Brook flies by Luffy's face pops back to normal. "Hey Nami what'd you do that for? We were having fun!"
@UsoppsFables "It stung like crazy! Your shot hit perfectly!" 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Then my future's past!" 

"♪…

"♪Miss Nami's Panties, shrouded with mystery♪" 

"I shall invite her to tea and ask for a-- @GomuGomuPi…

"♪Just imagine how SWEEEEET THEY WILL BEEEEEEEEEEEEE!♪" @GomuGomuPirate @TangerinePirate
@MonkeyDLuffyko "I'm from the future!? Then that means you're from the past!", Luffy begins to touch her back
@MonkeyDLuffyko "That's weird I'm Luffy and I'm gonna become the pirate king!"
@BonesAndPanties Luffy follows behind (much pun intended) tooting his own horn with the beat of the music. "Haha panties!!"
@Heavenly__Demon @SuiCidePark "No in my dreams I eat enough meat to feed a third world country!" 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "Awesome! I like you girl! What's your name?", Luffy asks for he is to simpleminded to realize they're basically the same.
@Heavenly__Demon @SuiCidePark What!? No way! I am a pinnacle of attraction! 
@MonkeyDLuffyko Luffy allows the comforting hug. "Well okay... Speaking of which you got any food?"
@SuiCidePark @Heavenly__Demon What you can't be serious that doo doo head sexy? 
@MonkeyDLuffyko "If nobody loves you that means they don't love me!!" 
@BonesAndPanties "Right-o Daddy-o!", Luffy stretches his lips out forming some sort of strange flesh bugle to make merriment with.
@UsoppsFables Luffy stood silent for a second. "... WAHHH!!", Luffy howled as he rolled around on the ground holding his forehead.
@UsoppsFables [Luffy tries to catch the rubber band between his two fingers like a G, but it slips through and pops him in the forehead.
@BonesAndPanties "A pirate's gotta make merriment!!"
@KaisokuGariZoro "I'm ready for whatever that dragon had to throw at me! ", Luffy goes on (cont) 
@KaisokuGariZoro "But Zoro just look at it!", Luffy yelled out as he continued to waddle whilst the candy village came into view.
@UsoppsFables "What kind of new tricks?", Luffy asked with much curiousity.
@TangerinePirate Luffy was already on it, and by on it I mean he was making faces at the dead heads, and laughing up a storm in the cave.
@KaisokuGariZoro Luffy turned around with the sign throat deep in his mouth. He quickly swallowed (cont) 
@KaisokuGariZoro "Zoro... we have to go after this treasure!", Luffy yells with (cont) 
@KaisokuGariZoro Luffy began to pull on his cheek stretching it before letting it go, and it snapping back into place. "I don't think so."
@KaisokuGariZoro The trees began to carry on the conversation with Luffy. "Zoro come check this out!"
@KaisokuGariZoro Luffy begins making idle conversation with the trees in the area.
@UsoppsFables "Got any cool new tricks up you sleeves?"
@KaisokuGariZoro "Maybe we should ask someone for directions." 
@KaisokuGariZoro "Hmm...", Luffy stops in his tracks for a moment. "When did we get into a forest!?" 
@TangerinePirate "Let's go loot their camp!"
@UsoppsFables "Nothing she just gave it to me! Aren't I lucky today!"
@KaisokuGariZoro "Okay then!", Luffy says cheerfully as he begins walking North instead of West. "I have a good feeling about this."
@UsoppsFables "That's true... Guess what Usopp? Nami gave me a whole beli!"
@KaisokuGariZoro "Are we there yet?" 
@portgas_gold "Ace don't screw around like that!"
@KaisokuGariZoro Luffy follows Zoro's expert directional skill, I mean he can't get anymore lost right?
@portgas_gold "ACE!!!"
@KaisokuGariZoro "Yeah, maybe we'll find some food along the way!"
@portgas_gold "Yeah we are..."
@KaisokuGariZoro Luffy pops back to his original shape. "This one?", Luffy points to himself slightly confused because he will be king.
@UsoppsFables "Haha Usopp's not a 'scary' pirate!" 
@portgas_gold 
@KaisokuGariZoro "The one who's going to become Pirate King of course. Plus Nami is the one who does all the directional stuff."
@KaisokuGariZoro "Zoro... where are we?!"
@portgas_gold "Ace don't say things like this!" 
@portgas_gold "Ace!!", Luffy yells as he rushes to his side. 
@portgas_gold Ace! 
Luffy falls asleep to dream about meat trees. #offline

@UsoppsFables "Right! Maybe he'll sign my Sogeking collectible action figure!" 
@ChivalrousCook "I can't wait to eat! I'm gonna eat till I implode, and then eat some more!" 
@UsoppsFables "Well if he really wants to fight again I'll give him another chance just for the /halibut/." 
@ChivalrousCook "Make it 16,000 I could eat enough for 8000 men by myself!" 
@ChivalrousCook "You sure about that Sanji? I think the future king of the pirates could use 8000 men."
@UsoppsFables "That Sogeking sure is a badass." 
@UsoppsFables Luffy places his hands in front of his mouth to hold in the laughter. "I beat him once I guess it's time to make it oFISHial!"
"We have 8000 crewmates?! That's amazing!!"
@UsoppsFables "Arlong's back?? Something's fishy about this."
@TangerinePirate Luffy just laughed at the situation in general. "These guys are funny!", (cont) 
@TangerinePirate "Woah look at that thing!", Luffy yelled out not listening to the (cont) 
@TangerinePirate "Yahoo!", Luffy runs head first through the entrance into the darkness of the cavern.
@SupaSupaNoDaz "Sometimes I look out to the sea and get all soul searchy."
"It's so quiet here..." 
@Heavenly__Demon My meat induced suffering has been avenged.
@Heavenly__Demon Little does Doflamingo know, but Luffy had left a present in his bed. Hint it rhymes with doo doo.
"Kamen Rider Straw Hat!" 
@That3Swordman "The ship's pretty quiet on the ship lately."
@That3Swordman Luffy tosses him a bottle of his favorite drink. "One step ahead of you."
@That3Swordman "It's afternoon. You slept the whole day away."
@TangerinePirate "Then let's go!", Luffy yells out running towards the cavern forgetting about everything else.
@That3Swordman "Zoro, wake up."
@pizzapinkette @SupaSupaNoDaz @DesertLaSpada //At work being my best friend ever.

@TangerinePirate "You can have the treasure I just want to eat whatever's inside of there."
@TangerinePirate "What do you mean?" 
@TangerinePirate "He's back on the ship. Should we invite Robin too? We might need more hands to carry all of your treasure."
@That3Swordman "Best friends..." 
@That3Swordman "And that's why we're best friends! We understand each other!"
@That3Swordman "They don't?" 
@pirateempress_ 
@pirateempress_ "My meat! What'd you do that for!"
@Heavenly__Demon "That Doflamingo! Ragh! He really steams me up!"
@pirateempress_ "Huh sure I guess.", Luffy holds out the meat as if to feed her.
//I enjoy our hateful relationship Doflamingo
@Heavenly__Demon 
@pirateempress_ Luffy is quite confused by the sudden outburst, but instead begins to feed himself.
@Heavenly__Demon "You were a big poo poo head. That's about it."
@pirateempress_ "I can feed myself though if that would be easier. I'm starving!!"
@pirateempress_ "What do you mean? You just pick up the meat, and put it here.", Luffy says as he points to his mouth.
@pirateempress_ "Meat!", Luffy is immune to her charms for he is too simple-minded.
@pirateempress_ "Meat!", Luffy threw his hands up into the air excitedly.
@That3Swordman "We're best friends Zoro."
@That3Swordman 
@pirateempress_ "Do you have any meat? I'm pretty hungry." 
@pirateempress_ Luffy turns around to she the women standing there, "Oh hey Hancock!", he says with a smile.

@Cat_Nami1 "Where are we gonna eat?"
@TangerinePirate "Sanji could come along. I might get hungry while we're exploring."
@Cat_Nami1 "Yeah! You're lettin' me be myself!"
@Cat_Nami1 "Let's eat all the meat on the ship before Sanji finds out!"
@TangerinePirate "So you'll come with me!? Yes!" 
@Cat_Nami1 Luffy finishes off the meat she had given him. "I'm still hungry."
@Cat_Nami1 Luffy leaps on the offer and begins to devour the meat. "Thanks Nami!" 
@TangerinePirate "I want to say that they said something about butt loads of gem stones." 
@Cat_Nami1 "I'm pretty hungry!"
@Cat_Nami1 "Yo.", Luffy raises his hand to greet the navigator.
@TangerinePirate "That might be there...", Luffy sticks his finger on his lip trying to remember.
@TangerinePirate "Oh yeah! There's a cave behind a village near here that's suppose to be filled with traps, wild animals, and bandits!"
@OharasLegacy "Let's try his room.", Luffy gets off of the deck rubbing his head.
@TangerinePirate "Then I would've come to save you obviously."
@OharasLegacy "We should find him...", Luffy says lazily. "I have to pee first."
@OharasLegacy "It's worth a shot though right?"
@OharasLegacy Luffy rolls around in pain on the deck. "Where's that damn reindeer at a time like this!"
@TangerinePirate Luffy thought back to his search which included getting food for himself and running away from the tab. "Y-yeah..."
@OharasLegacy "I suddenly have a throbbing headache and everything is so loud!"
@OharasLegacy "Huh?", Luffy looked her for a moment before grabbing his head in pain. "Owwch!!"
@TangerinePirate "Nami where've you been!? We've been looking for you forever!" 
@OharasLegacy "What's that?" 
@OharasLegacy "You don't look so good?" 
@DesertLaSpada "A tournament sounds like a lot of fun!" 
@EatingPeopIe "Oh well okay...", Luffy begins to walk away from the situation.
@OharasLegacy Luffy still asleep spread out along the deck began to stir from his slumber. He sat (cont) 
@DesertLaSpada "Tournament!!?!!", Luffy exclaims as he eats all of Crocodile's shaved ice. 
@OharasLegacy Luffy returns from his pee break only to return back to his exact position and fall back asleep.
@EatingPeopIe "Yeah who's there?"
@OharasLegacy Morning comes and Luffy wakes up from his spot. "I have to pee...", he states to himself as he walks to the bathroom.
@Heavenly__Demon Luffy watches the bone bounce on the ground as he stands there mortified.
@Heavenly__Demon "You'll pay for this treachery Doflamingo!" 
@OharasLegacy Luffy dreams of giant hamburgers just for him and no body else especially that poo poo head Doflamingo. 
@Heavenly__Demon Luffy looks up to watch the horror happening in slow motion. "You monster Doflamingo!" 
@OharasLegacy Luffy eventually falls off onto the deck snoring loudly in drunken sleep.
@Heavenly__Demon "Heh where are you going!?!", Luffy begins pouncing after the meat wiggle his butt in the air before each pounce.
@OharasLegacy A loud snoring noise could be heard coming from Luffy's mouth as he had fallen asleep still wrapped around Robin.
@OharasLegacy "Not till you forgive me!", Luffy uses his powers to wrap his arms around her legs even further.
@Heavenly__Demon Luffy smells the meat from a mile away. "You're all mine now!" 
@OharasLegacy "Oh... yeah. Then just forgive me!!", he begins drunkenly rubbing his face on her leg adding to his act of desperation.
@OharasLegacy Luffy now desperate for forgiveness did the only thing a drunk man in his situation (cont) 
@OharasLegacy "S-sorry." 
his feet, "What was that f-for!" (2/2) 
@OharasLegacy The bottle slammed into his face leaving an imprint of its shape in his face before he fell over. Luffy then shot up to (1/2)
“@Heavenly__Demon: That damned mugiwara messed my office up..” 
@OharasLegacy Luffy lifted his nose like a pig and began to snort back at Robin.
@Heavenly__Demon "Mugiwara away!", Luffy leaps out of the window leaving behind his mess.
@Heavenly__Demon "I'm satisfied for now!" 
@OharasLegacy "You sure know how to have a good time! No wonder Sanji likes you so much!" 
@OharasLegacy "Where are they anyways?", Luffy pops up thinking about it for a second before falling back down. "Ahh who cares.", he laughs.
@Heavenly__Demon Viciously attacks the meat like the manner depraved animal that he is. 
@OharasLegacy Luffy began to laugh loudly with her kicking his legs in child like glee. "This is so much fun!"
@OharasLegacy "Hey hey don't be that way Robin.", Luffy continues to chuckle rolling around on the deck near her trying to get her attention
"What're they doing over there?", Luffy stares at the timeline slightly disturbed. 
@OharasLegacy He sluggishly turned to face Robin. "You fell.", he began to snicker as he fell backwards sitting down. 
@OharasLegacy "You were right Robin this is best stuff!", Luffy remarked as he tried (cont) 
@OharasLegacy Luffy got off of the ground, grabbed the bottle drinking from it for several seconds. (cont) 
@OharasLegacy Luffy tries to keep his balance, but to no avail. He falls backwards and hits his (cont) 
@OharasLegacy Luffy let out a huge laugh at her hiccup almost falling back in his seat.
@OharasLegacy "Devastation!", Luffy finally figured out the word he was trying to use before taking a large gulp of the sake.
@OharasLegacy Luffy laughs a bit as he pops the cork on his own bottle. "I hope you can handle the desertion... depression... delegation..."
@OharasLegacy "Crack open those bottles lady!"
@OharasLegacy "Oooo the good stuff!", Luffy said with drunken giggle. "Way to go Robin!"
@OharasLegacy "More sake!!", Luffy exclaimed waiting for Sanji to show up with more.
@OharasLegacy "I guess.... that's strue.", Luffy slurs a little of speech as he quickly pours another glass for himself.
@OharasLegacy "Why're you slowin' down?! You'll lose at that rate!", Luffy begins laugh loudly feeling the effects more and more.
@OharasLegacy "Hell yeah!", Luffy yells out picking up the glass and slamming down the liquor.
@OharasLegacy Luffy throws his hands up to the sky starting to feel the sake. "Yeah!" 
@OharasLegacy "Don't worry about that! You're with us now!"
@OharasLegacy "Working with him wasn't awful, but he's not the best person.", he downs the rest of his glass before filling up the glasses.
@OharasLegacy "That's true I guess... but he's a great fighter!"
@OharasLegacy There was a long  pause before he responded. "You mean I almost died covered in honey barbecue glaze!?" 
@Namiswan8 "Heh heh no problem!"
@OharasLegacy "Petting them and riding them that sorta stuff right?", Luffy replied setting down his glass as well.
@Namiswan8 Luffy places a blanket over Nami's cold body. "There we go!"
@Namiswan8 "Do you need a blanket or something Nami?"
@Namiswan8 "Of course Nami!"
@Namiswan8 "What's wrong!?"
@Namiswan8 "You'll be better in no time."
@Namiswan8 "Please rest Nami..."
@Namiswan8 "I did, but I'm more worried about getting you healthy again!"
@Namiswan8 "What's wrong Nami?"
@Namiswan8 "Don't be... How are you feeling?"
@OharasLegacy Luffy picks up his glass, "I saw Crocodile today. He was gonna let me play with (cont) 
@OharasLegacy "Who cares about the money?", Luffy drinks his third glass smiling widely.
@OharasLegacy Luffy tosses back the sake like a champ. "I gotta agree with that!", he replied pouring more sake into both of their glasses.
@OharasLegacy Luffy waits for Robin to fill hers up before he fills his own. "This is really great sake!"
@OharasLegacy Luffy grabs a couple of glasses filling them up with sake. "Let's get to it!", he declares as he downs the first glass.
@OharasLegacy "We can just get more later! Are you ready?"
@OharasLegacy "We'll go pint for pint! First to give up loses!"
@OharasLegacy "Hmm... How about a drinking game!"
@OharasLegacy "That sounds awesome!" 
@OharasLegacy "A lot of things yeah!" 
@OharasLegacy "I'm confused, but it's fun!"
@OharasLegacy "Did you?" 
@OharasLegacy "But you just said..."
@OharasLegacy "You won't win again! I swear it Robin!" 
@OharasLegacy "...Fine you win." 
@OharasLegacy "I don't always talk about it... sometimes I talk about meat!"
@OharasLegacy "They better, a pirate's gotta sing and dance ya know!"
@OharasLegacy "They're too funny not to have around!" 
@OharasLegacy "Right! Oh by the way have you seen Brook or Chopper? I can't find them anywhere."
@OharasLegacy "With you guys I'll definitely fulfill my dream."
@Namiswan8 Luffy blushes at the sudden kiss. "N-Nami."
@OharasLegacy "Anything's possible for the man who's gonna become the king of pirates!" 
@OharasLegacy "I want all the meat Robin!" 
@Namiswan8 "Yeah Nami what is it?"
@OharasLegacy "I hear the guy has to share his meat with the girl. I don't think I could ever do that!"
@OharasLegacy "So what's it like dating someone? Is it complicated?"
@Namiswan8 "Nami... I'm sorry I couldn't do more."
@OharasLegacy "That's what I like to hear!" 
@OharasLegacy "Robin you and Sanji are kinda something right? Can you get him to give me a bigger portion during dinner?"
@Namiswan8 "Anything for you Nami." 
@Namiswan8 "We'll do it together Nami. The doctor is here, and he'll get you feeling better."
@Namiswan8 "T-there's still so much we have to do! What about your dream you can't close your eyes yet!
@Namiswan8 "W-wait Nami don't go!"
@Namiswan8 "Y-yes Nami?", Luffy replied to her teary-eyed.
@Namiswan8 "Nami!!" 
@Namiswan8 Luffy could only grit his teeth as she hugged him. There was absolutely nothing he could do for her by himself.
@Namiswan8 Luffy leans in closer at Nami's request.
@Namiswan8 "Dammit why don't I know anything about medicine!"
@Namiswan8 The doctor rushes out and takes Nami away leaving Luffy waiting.
@Namiswan8 "Breathe dammit!", Luffy continues the process trying desperately to save his friend.
//All this stuff is happening and I'm just like. 
@Namiswan8 After making the huge scene Luffy finally finds the clinic. He kicks open the door and (cont) 
@Namiswan8 "Just hold on Nami!", Luffy tries the reassure her as he runs into the town (cont) 
@Namiswan8 Luffy lifts her up into his arms. "I don't know where Chopper is! We'll have to find a doctor in town!"
@Namiswan8 "Nami!", Luffy yells out as he rushes to her side. "What's happening!?" 
@Namiswan8 "Of course it's me!" 
//Oh my glob you guys drama bomb!
@DesertLaSpada Luffy rolls off of the table with a large crash before bolting out of the door. "Sorry 'bout that Crocodile!"
@DesertLaSpada Luffy slips out of the sand due to the slipperiness of the glaze and lands on the (cont) 
@DesertLaSpada Luffy wiggles his appendages all over flinging honey barbecue glaze and knocking down expensive things all over the room.
"Jesus Christ how horrifying." 
@DesertLaSpada "Wait a minute... I can't swim!!" 
@DesertLaSpada As Luffy smells the glaze he can do nothing but be mesmerized my its honey barbecue goodness. 
@DesertLaSpada "I get to eat the meat afterwards right!?"
@DesertLaSpada 
@DesertLaSpada "You'd really let me!?" 
@DesertLaSpada "Bananawani are small enough to fit in your pants? I thought they'd be bigger." 
@DesertLaSpada "Do you have any of those Bananwani around? I want to ride one!", Luffy smiled widely hoping for the answer he wanted.
@DesertLaSpada "I like that. It's easy for me to understand." 
@DesertLaSpada "Where's those sunglasses come from?" 
@DesertLaSpada "Kuhahahaha!" 
@Namiswan8 "Nami where have you been!? I've been looking all over for you!"
@That3Swordman //It's hard to make this uniform look this good. 
@SwirlyBrow "Sanji all your flattery's made me hungry. What's to eat?"
"Sanji found Robin! So great! Now we just have to find Nami." 
@DesertLaSpada //He's pretty silly I gotta admit.
@DesertLaSpada //By the way I got something cool.

"It's time to find my crew! Wherever you are I'll find you so we can all eat Sanji's meal!" 
"Man I slept the whole day away. Why didn't anybody wake me up?"
@ShefuSanji "Make sure there's lots of meat in it!"
@DesertLaSpada "No thanks I can't die yet I haven't reached my goal.", Luffy walks out of the picture grinning.
@DesertLaSpada "Yeah I guess they are pretty tough. Well Crocodile I guess it's time to look for trouble."
@DesertLaSpada "I trust them well enough, but my friends could need me."
@DesertLaSpada "I wasn't asking for your help grumpy croc. I can find my friends on my own."
@DesertLaSpada "Well yeah kinda. I'm still looking for my crewmates to be honest.", Luffy scratches his face laughing slightly.
@DesertLaSpada "L-lucky me..." 
@DesertLaSpada Luffy scoots away a few steps. "Is that enough space?"
@KaizokuNoHanta "What does talking about women have to do with food?"

@DesertLaSpada "Fine grumpy crocodile." 
@DesertLaSpada Luffy falls off this time hitting his head before rolling on the ground. "That really hurt ya big crocodile!"
@DesertLaSpada Luffy merely sways keeping his grip. "Tell me the story about your scar again, Crocodile."
@SwirlyBrow @WolfFangBandit "M-my food....", Luffy suddenly breaks out into tears. 
@DesertLaSpada "That's no fun, bugging you is fun." 
@DesertLaSpada "No, I will be.", Luffy states in a more determined tone to the man.
@SwirlyBrow "Alright! It's time to eat!", Luffy exclaims rushing over to the cook to devour the meal prepared for him.
@SwirlyBrow "Best ship cook ever.", Luffy comments before wandering back to the main deck and wait for the meal.
@SwirlyBrow "Meat wrapped in meat, with a side of meat!" 
@SwirlyBrow "FOOOOD!!" 
@DesertLaSpada 
@_BlackLegSanji "Flattery won't get you anywhere Sanji, but thanks for the compliment!" 
@ShefuSanji "You know what will make you fell better? Cooking up a huge breakfast!" 
@ShefuSanji "Who knows where Nami went since we docked!? Zoro is sleeping in the same spot as always! And Ussop might be dead so let's eat!
@ShefuSanji "Well that's no fun. Are you going make breakfast now Sanji?"
@ShefuSanji "Ohh... so it is tasty?" 
@ShefuSanji "It doesn't taste as good as you'd think.", Luffy says as he begins to rub his lips. "By the way what's a 'Lol'? Is it tasty?
@ShefuSanji [Stares at you like] 
@ShefuSanji "Sanji I found you! It's breakfast time!" 
@KaizokuNoHanta "We need to find him. I'm starving.", Luffy complained to his first mate.
@KaizokuNoHanta "Zoro! Thank god I found you. Where's Sanji he needs to be cooking dinner?" 
"Sanji what's for dinner!?"
@DesertLaSpada "You're such a grumpy crocodile, Crocodile.", Luffy immediately hurries off to find din dins. 
@DesertLaSpada "Fine then. I'll just get Sanji to feed me it's almost dinner time!" 
@DesertLaSpada "Free meat taste better." 
@DesertLaSpada "Hey Crocodile do you got any meat? All that counting made me hungry!" 
@DesertLaSpada Luffy begins to count the number of lives using his fingers. "Like seven?"
@DesertLaSpada Luffy rubs his hat where his head had been hit. "Don't you dare Crocodile! This hat is more important then any life!"
@DesertLaSpada "Speaking of tact do Bananawani taste good?" 
@DesertLaSpada "Stop this breathing business, I think we'd be better off.", Luffy began to mock Crocodile.
