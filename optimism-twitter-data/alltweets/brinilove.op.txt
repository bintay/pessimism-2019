@RB_Dodgers which is why I said they're the root of the problem.&amp;if I do remember correctly,it took sometime to get a deal wTWC/DTV &amp;Lakers
@RB_Dodgers I understand they're not involved in the provider talks, but for them not signing that deal this problem wouldn't exist.
@abel_figgy <WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><WHITE UP POINTING BACKHAND INDEX> slaybel
@RB_Dodgers yes you can say they can't "predict" that the two wouldn't come to a deal, but that's just being naive.
@RB_Dodgers how is it not fair? With their deal they automatically excluded fans, they are the root of the problem.
Alright alright alright, here we go! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><BLUE HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<BASEBALL>Ô∏è
@RDdeucess truuuueeee. Lets go Cubs!! You watching the game?
@Mando12297 it was the Dodgers fault when they made that deal with time warner. They excluded 70% of their fans with that deal.

Seriously, going two seasons with out Dodger baseball is ridiculous. You exist because of the fans. Don't black out 70% of us.
Hey @Dodgers, do you know that 70% of your fans can not view games because of that stupid Time Warner deal? Please fix this.

@abel_figgy he won't stop crying about the Kemp trade. Like, Kemp hasn't had a good season in 3 years. Let's move forward.
@abel_figgy are you following berts ball?

I thought it was a pretty interesting discussion.
Although I agree that society as a whole has come a long way, there is no denying that not only racism, but discrimination, still exists.
The point being made was that sterling, and the NV rancher prove that racism still exists in America.
Recently the SC struck down section 5 of the VRA, and most recently voted down affirmative action, because they are no longer needed.
So, in class today an interesting point was brought up during discussion. Donald Sterling and that Rancher from NV did us all a favor.

So excited to make the road trip to Laughlin this Thursday to see @Jason_Aldean <AUTOMOBILE><DASH SYMBOL><CLINKING BEER MUGS><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I'm hungry, who's hungry? A chipotle sandwich from Geezers sounds amazing.
I'm sitting on my couch eating Nutella by the spoonful and watching Scary Movie. This is sad, but I'm happy.
Holy hell! U.S Cellular field is eeemmmpppttyyyy!

Anyone at the #DisneyboundMeetup?! I'm in the park looking to meet y'all!
@LaDisneyBound I'm pretty excited for today! Hopefully I get to meet you!!
I need to get my hands on Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In for Graduates! I loved her first one.
My at bat app tells me that there's free baseball happening at Dodger stadium! Awh yeaahhhuuuuhhh. Second night in a row.
"Microsoft went down three points"...."but I wipe my own ass!" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Big Daddy never gets old.
I have literally read 6 consecutive tweets about Josh Hamilton sliding into first base, and injuring himself. <UNAMUSED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>
Geezus, it's been 5 years since baseball and the Angels lost Nick Adenhart. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<BABY ANGEL><BASEBALL>Ô∏è
Nothing like a little @dustinlynch to get my day going! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è<HEADPHONE><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>Ô∏è
Coughing up phlegm is probable the worst part of being sick. <CONFOUNDED FACE><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
I would have liked to see Brad Ausmus back at Dodger stadium. Pretty bummed that I didn't get tickets to this series against the Tigers.
Thanks Davis.
I can't be on tumblr in front of anyone anymore. I went from baseball, Disney, to porn on my dash! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WEARY FACE>
Joba, you're so dirty
I hate this no collision rule. I understand the safety aspect, but it throws the base running off. It doesn't make sense.
@A_Carrillo88 I blame time Warner and the dodgers for this crap.
@A_Carrillo88 mother eff! Those assholes.
Scherzer on the mound tonight! I wish I could have gone to tonight's game. Would love to see him pitch.
The fact that I can't watch the @Dodgers game, is starting to get me really mad. DirecTV and Time Warner need to figure it out! <POUTING FACE>
@FckYouBreezy girl my period is saying the exact same thing!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I get sick the day I have to go back to school. Just wonderful.
It's warming up this week! I'm thinking shorts and my cowboy boots! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è<BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>Ô∏è<WOMANS BOOTS>

Oh snap! I only understood about every other word that @C_Gomez27 was saying but that rap on @IntentionalTalk was siiiiccckk.
They have provided me with some amazing opportunities. That's more than some people can say.
Football arguments aside. I've made the best of my education, and I'm working towards something better. So what I'm doing it at CSUF.
Like fuck off dude. At least we're working towards something. I got into some good schools, but couldn't afford them.
Y'all know I take my education seriously, and when someone bashes the school I go to, or any state school for that matter, I get heated.
Fuck that old fart got me heated! @abel_figgy  CSUF a safety school? Fuck you dude.
@abel_figgy for real! Lol.
@abel_figgy y'all are already in Pendleton. Fuck your dad must be flying.
I'm literally dying @abel_figgy timeline.
@abel_figgy go to CSUF but can't root for a D1 elite football school. Tool logic.
@abel_figgy who's the douchebag popping up in my feed?! Get outta here meat! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@abel_figgy lets not forget. 
@abel_figgy what time are you guys coming?
Get it together Scheppers.
But seriously, I get to see Robinson Cano's debut as a Mariner, and a solid pitchers dual between Felix and Weaver. So I win.
Angels home opener tonight. This is so wrong is so many ways. But fuck it, it's an opening game! I'll wear my Fullerton Hat. <BASEBALL>Ô∏è
I want to know which MLB players have annual passes to Disneyland. <EUROPEAN CASTLE><SPARKLES><BASEBALL>Ô∏è

@dredayyyyz giiiirrrrrllll Paul LoDuca was my man!! I legit cried when they traded him! Shawn Green though. <SMIRKING FACE>

‚Äú@BIG_FUDGE91: Fuck Tommy Lasorda‚Äù how dare you say that!!
Garrido gets his 1,894th career win tonight, most in NCAA history.

@abel_figgy bruh! Their farm system is pretty decent.
"You're important, I love you, and the joy of life is in the journey".
So ready to punch the shit out of the guy that sits behind me.
"We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all". 30 years ago today, the Breakfast Club had detention.
The Rangers just can't catch a break with these injuries.


@piimpiiniickii I know he does!! I've seen an episode here and there but I need to start from episode 1.
Why am I laughing so hard at the Charmin twitter account? And why do I want to follow it?
