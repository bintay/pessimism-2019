#UKIP and #Farage prove to be most unprofessional party today! Clearly engineered so he remains leader! Taking us for idiots! #Unresignation
@Jon_Primett @LozEWright I too would only stand in Rochester South and Horsted, unless incumbents wish to continue!
@Jon_Primett @LozEWright @benpranczke People hate nothing more than a professional politician who has done nothing else in their life!
@LozEWright @Jon_Primett @benpranczke Totally agree, but let's stand in only home wards or wards of specific interest not random!
@Jon_Primett @LozEWright @benpranczke I have respect for them both however too many are doing it to further their careers!
@Jon_Primett People clearly don't want career politicians they want local people, that is abundantly clear! #Labour
@Jon_Primett They suffered more in council elections than national in my opinion! To have gained no seats and lose one in Twydal and L&amp;W!
Dan Jarvis was the only man who could resurrect Labour. He now leaves a bunch of baboons to succeed Ed!

Thank you Dan!

Roll on 2020!
Can't describe the euphoria I feel today after last weeks wins and Medway Council landslide! @KellyTolhurst @tracey_crouch @Rehman_Chishti

@MarkReckless Tell me that again in two weeks time when @KellyTolhurst is our MP! Can't you see you are blocking our only exit from the EU!
@MarkReckless @KellyTolhurst Is there anything he won't blame on immigration? Glenn is right though they're are virtually no UKIP posters!
@MarkReckless @GlennMoore1974 Mark, surely you know better than to broadcast rumours as if they are fact? You started looking for a new job?

Let us never forget what happened last time Labour was in control of our economy! 
Miliband pretty much confirms he would put Socialist ideas at the heart of his Government, punishing those who work hard! #BattleForNumber10
@AlanWCollins @billienegus I thought it was a requirement to be a UKIPper.
DC is right to say immigration has improved but his statement following proves we cannot completely control while in EU!

@OLDFE1 @vincemaple I'll take the potholes, you take the safe cycling routes!
@vincemaple @MedwayLabour we are not worried about anything, 3 of the R&amp;S cllrs were next to useless and have done us a favour!
@OLDFE1 @vincemaple Honestly, me and you alone would form a better run council than these bafoons!
@OLDFE1 @vincemaple @MedwayLabour They have proposed lots of expensive projects however they have not got any source of income to fund them!
@vincemaple @MedwayLabour None of which have been mentioned in your "promises". You're party really have no concept of money?
@MedwayLabour @vincemaple I don't see anything to do with the local economy there? #GE2015

@naushabahkhan You too, Naushabah!
@naushabahkhan Absolutely not, all I am saying is we are both ideologically Conservative. Like Greens and Labour are Socialist ideologically
@naushabahkhan You not seen the polls? Combined us and UKIP have nearly 50% of the vote! There is one way Labour is going and that is down!
@naushabahkhan I disagree with how you put it. He is wrong! I am sure PC will be over, now 50% of people will vote for a Conservative party!
@naushabahkhan He refuses to submit to the BBC's treading around eggshells agenda for political correctness. I think he should be suspended.
@naushabahkhan I am not disputing that. My point is that political correctness has gone too far and is coming before freedom of speech.
@MarinaMuttik Too right wing for the "Beeb"!

#jeremyclarkson
@naushabahkhan He punched a producer for not having food on the table? Nothing racist about that? Most issues, just politically incorrect!
Was it not less than two years ago Labour called itself the One Nation party. Now they will likely enter coalition with the SNP? #GE2015
2 months to the elections. Haven't had any definitive policies from Labour locally or nationally! Someone let me know if they get something!
I'd love to know where he gets his stats?

#GE2015
Reducing benefit cap to £23,000 is a good step however it still sounds to be a salary rather than a support net. #GE2015
@Ed_Miliband Rotherham Council is run by Labour. It was Labour who ignored warnings and evidence in preference of political correctness!!!

@jerijerod14 @KellyTolhurst @TurpinRupert Apologies. Chris. Not 300+' 1000+. Still not worth it?
@jerijerod14 @KellyTolhurst @TurpinRupert The problem with Medway hospital is only A&amp;E department and randomly chucking money is useless.
@jerijerod14 @KellyTolhurst @TurpinRupert Well from the looks of it, it won't be council money. Good investment for 300+ jobs! Not a waste
@jerijerod14 @KellyTolhurst @TurpinRupert The funding however has now been secured from Government! What's your personal opinion on it?
Great news that £4M has been secured for Rochester Airport. Best landmark in our ward. Plus 100s of new jobs!

@KellyTolhurst @TurpinRupert

@IsaacJduffy @UKLabour I noticed they say more powers for Scotland and Wales. What about England?

Overjoyed to learn that @AmjadBashirMEP has joined us!

Many congratulations to @anna_firth on her selection as PPC for Erith and Thamesmead. You will be a great upgrade on Teresa Pearce!

If @rogerfederer wins today it will be his 1000th career win! Simply amazing and inspirational!

#BrisbaneInternational
Labour's #OneNation seems to exclude England. Tax the English, bribe the Scots. Only in Labour do you get this kind of discrimination!
@LozEWright I don't doubt that but he's focused more on the next step on his career ladder rather than people in Luton and Wayfield.
@LozEWright Both of them poor politicians, but good entertainers.
Even though life is quieter on Twitter now, since both Chris Irvine and Tristan Osborne have blocked me it is much less entertaining!
Pleased to see @David_Cameron standing up for those without a voice (The Green Party). Either include the Greens or exclude UKIP! #Debates
Lost count of how many times Labour mentioned #NHS. Disgusting to use our health service as a political football.
@MrMarkClarke @cllrhealy This woman is really beginning to make my blood boil. It's one thing to be republican but this is uncalled for.
Congress 100% controlled by #GOP. Now let's follow form in the UK and elect a true Conservative majority government and get out of the EU!
@MrMarkClarke @cllrhealy is an absolute disgrace to all who elected her. Such an insult to Jewish people everywhere, not least Jewish Tories
@jbarkermarine Totally agree with him, provided he does back an out vote! #BetterOffOut
Another bit of positive analysis from the by election, Socialist/Communist parties polled only 21%, Conservative parties polled 77%!
Interesting fact. Labour received 1,000 less votes in RS by election than the Lib Dems did in 2010. clear rejection of Labour in Medway!
@MedwayLabour That's interesting. Last time I checked Cllr Jane Chitty didn't sit on planning and thus wasn't present at Lodge Hill meeting!


There we have it from Labour shadow cabinet Member @marycreagh_mp, both UKIP and Labour will privatise the NHS!
@MedwayLabour @RSCCA is united against Lodge Hill. We Have a strong Chair in @andrewmackness and brilliant cllrs fighting the development!
@MedwayLabour No @RSCCA Cllrs voted for Lodge Hill. As far as the UKIP defectors, it is laughable, I can count them on my hands!
@MedwayLabour You always attack us, but it is you who openly support concreting the few rural areas of Medway left! @RSCCA has opposed it!
@MarkReckless @KellyTolhurst Mark, could you please name one occasion since your re-election that you have done something for R&amp;S Primaries?
There is only one true green and conservationist party left and that is @Conservatives. Labour will destroy and desecrate our green spaces.
While UKIP couldn't make up their mind on lodge hill, we forgot who poses the astronomical danger to our Green Space, @MedwayLabour!

“@DanHannanMEP: A gentle reminder. 
@UKLabour @vincemaple You also forget to mention how the tax free personal allowance is rising to £12,500, the lowest earners pay NOTHING.
@vincemaple Give it up Vince. Labour have lost any mandate 2 advise economically. Just accept people are better off under the @Conservatives

£75.9bn in 2015
£40.9bn in 2016
£14.5bn in 2017 
Surplus of £4bn in 2018-19.…

Getting bored of Andy Burnham ranting! Where's @cmackinlay?

#murnaghan
Interesting to see Labour have suddenly shut up about the NHS, wonder if it has anything to do with @George_Osborne's announcement?
@vincemaple @SteveIles I was under impressions it was 3, Leader, Deputy and Whip. Thus Lib Dem group. 1/2
Labour are getting pathetic and desperate with their social media campaigns. First #webackEd and now this #CameronMustGo rubbish!
Labour once again have no economic policy and all they can do is raise taxes and punish hard workers! 50p rate is theft not tax!
Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, it's inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery!
Disgraceful and completely "un-libertarian" new policy from Labour on limiting people to one pint/glass of beer/wine a day!  

#NannyState
@SheffLibDems @nick_clegg Hey look! The entire national Lib Dem membership all in one photo!

@Chris_Challis will do Chris. I am supporting Kelly but I none the less wish you the best of luck in the by election.

Great meeting you!
Had one of the most enjoyable days of the campaign so far today. Met so many great people especially from @RoadTrip2015! 

#TeamKelly
So pleased the #webackEd campaign is doing so well. We in the Conservatives are very pleased with Ed and think he is doing good! (For Us)
Elected regional assemblies are a bureaucratic waste of money. 

Simply four devolved assemblies with equal powers will suffice!
@PaulOnPolitics England will do fine. 

Even though population wise note equal to Scotland. Look in America, California and Wyoming.
@vincemaple Is this same NHS that cared for his terminally ill son! It is despicable how Labour Make out he doesn't care about the NHS!
On November 20 we get a chance to send a clear message to self serving politicians. Vote @KellyTolhurst &amp; @ronniesands and kick UKRAP out!
@Mike_Fabricant If we work hard, take cuts, and fix are shattered economy we then cough up to the EU! This is wrong! 

#BetterOffOut
@David_Cameron will go down in history of one of our strongest PMs. We have been waiting so long for someone to stand up and #SayNo2Brussels
So we work hard to get our economy out of trouble and back on track and the EU just take from us! 

Say no to Brussels! 

#BetterOffOut
John Redwood is quite right in saying we should refuse to pay EU money. What are they going to do? Send bailiffs in?
Can't preach how overjoyed I am that @KellyTolhurst has been selected as our candidate! She is the best option this town has ever had!
Good to see it's the right way here in #RochesterStrood! People far more excited about the arrival of @Mike_Fabricant rather than Miliprat!
Haven't had much to thank Reckless for lately but I can thank him that I got the chance to meet @Mike_Fabricant 
@acbowie Too right! We are going to miss you Andrew! Thanks for all your help! 

Next time I see you I want North Scotland painted blue!
Another great morning campaigning. This time in my area and with @TurpinRupert, @Freeman_George and @markhobanmp. 
Great morning campaigning with @JDjanogly! 
@KellyTolhurst Rochester girl representing and standing up for Rochester &amp; Strood. 

VOTE KELLY #TOLHURST FOR CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATE!
Outstanding talk from the PM. We have a clear choice here and that is to vote for @KellyTolhurst or @anna_firth! Securing a better future!
#Carswell &amp; #Reckless have cost taxpayers £500,000! 

This could so be better spent elsewhere! 

Send a clear message &amp; vote @KellyTolhurst!
@KellyTolhurst is the only local candidate who will put local values 1st!

She is a lady of the people, by the people, and for the people!
@James_Peck98 She will gain this seat (probably with a massive majority). 

@KellyTolhurst will be the best Mp we could possibly hope for!
@James_Peck98 @KellyTolhurst Here Here! She has been an OUTSTANDING local councillor, a great cabinet member and will dethrone #Reckess!
@KellyTolhurst took over from @MarkReckless in Rochester West and now she is going to take his seat in parliament as well! #VoteTory
Overjoyed to hear @KellyTolhurst and @anna_firth have been short listed as our candidates for the by election! Both excellent Tory cllrs!


@vincemaple has a very valid point. UKIP was in 2010 the ONLY party in favour of estuary airport. @MarkReckless will you campaign for one?
There we have it from the UKIP deputy chairman herself! If you vote UKIP you get Labour and it doesn't matter.

 
If #India can afford a multi-million $ space programme why do they receive $500M in aid from the UK each year? Or is it funding the space?
How is it fair that MPs representing Scottish, Welsh, Irish constituencies get a vote on matters the effect only England? #EnglishParliament
