#Scandal #ABCUpfront 
Ya'll ain't even right with this.  
How lucky is @SarahDrewGreys in this picture? I wanna be the cream to a @iJesseWilliams @JussieSmollett Oreo! 
Look at these boos!  
Pretty stoked about American Crime Story: People vs OJ Simpson. Lots of big names in it.
Jennifer Lopez.. I love you, I really do.. and this is why I am saying.. what the actual fuck are you doing with Casper Smart? Puke.
They're all.. see, Patrick? Show will go on.  
Ellen Pompeo is seriously THE best.
I love how people at my job just come and go as they damn well please. Multiple days off a week, not scheduled ahead of time. WTAF!
@iJesseWilliams Do you need a lawyer present? I've been to the Georgetown Law campus. I feel I am qualified.
Look at my man looking all suave and serial killerish.  
Too early to laugh but lol  
I give this dude props for being able to pretend being with Farrah doesn't make him to jump off a bridge #TeenMomOG
Boo thang @iJesseWilliams is at the #ABCUpfront woo fucking hoo!!!
I heard @openrunshow was renewed too. Truth??
Man Kristen Cavallari keeps poppin those babies out doesn't she.
It's about damn time to be honest. 
@JustaThought47 if it's a sad cliff I might have to throw in the towel. S11 has really taken a toll.
@iJesseWilliams Niiice. Are you going to upfronts in NYC
@JustaThought47 I'm too nervous!! Lol this is killer. I don't know if I can take any more sadness. Shipping Japril has become depressing
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I forgot what it's like to have Japril anxiety lol this is killer
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui yeah its a good sign they at least get a decent amount of story
@1crightonly wtf seriously? Lol i didn't!
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui it just shows that Japril is gonna shine this epi, he's pumped
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui for Jackson to finally put his feelings first
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui I think it means Jackson's about to shine. Reblogged Jackson/alex high five. Think Jesse is ready
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui Jesse reblogging a lot. Japril selfie in 24.. Jsckson gif set 23.
@mrush353 thanks Mandy <TWO HEARTS>
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui I'm with you. I think they will end in a passionate emotional embrace.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui I feel the same way. Think it's gonna be epic for them. A repeated rewatch for us
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui I'm really hoping so.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui 9x24. We know how much he loves and misses her, unlike then.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui This won't work as a cliff tho because hard to fathom J being like it's too late. Like he did in
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui make her happy. If I know April it's going to scare her into action.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui no she's oblivious to it. But at the end of the day, his heart is broken. Splitting w J won't
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui now she hasn't been fair 100x that. She's really hurt the guy.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui kinda a parallel to 9x24
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui chills. Jackson is DUE some love dammit!!!
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui I think so too! Just  thinking of her going to him and telling him what he means to her gives me
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui me too, it is set up in our favor.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui now* comprehending the consequences of her actions.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui yeah she looks guilty. Like she feels bad for her actions. Like she's just not comprehending
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui out the door. A year is enough for anyone to throw in the towel if things don't change.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui just the two of them after picturing their family for so long. In the process she has pushed him
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui right it was like if it couldn't be the 3 of them, it should be nothing. She couldn't go back to
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui waking her up from this trance she is in.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui him giving up and leaving is going to be an ice cold bucket of water dropped on her. Literally
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui she hasn't accepted Samuel is gone BUT she still has Jackson. Her loss has blinded everything
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui said she couldn't think of them because it's supposed to be 3 of them together as a family.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui Webbers speech. Seeing all you have to lose reminds you of what you have. Just at Christmas she
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui ever. At least you got some new techniques.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui if Jackson ends it for good then what does that really do? Well life just sucks sometimes for
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui of this entire season long journey. Accepting what she has lost and appreciating what she has
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui I don't see the writers wanting to "punish" April after all this tho. I think this is the climax
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui he's been neglected for too long.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui don't care how badass she is. It's going to be amazing to see how much she loves him because
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui this is that "next tragedy" that pulls you out of the bubble. Losing Jackson will crush April I
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui he means to her when she's realizes she might have lost him.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui yeah he's about to rock her world with some hard truths and I for one can't wait to see how much
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui between them that would be not good for us.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui it's a good thing she's oblivious to it, because if she was also feeling like things were bad
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui I think so too. I think she's going to feel horrible once she sees how much pain she's caused him
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui don't worry homegirl is gonna break. She will see the light. Losing Jackson will crush her.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui he's been perfect awesome husband for a reason, she will look insane to let him go.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui Jackson has been through too much. Having her just be like sorry, bye.. That cannot even happen.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui yeah and then I will be a sad panda and move on because WTF.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui see them being able to reconnect in finale.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui thing. But if it's acknowledged she's been running from feeling anything and breaks.. then I can
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui exactly. Basically if it's been going this way because they've just grown apart then thats one
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui Averys. You're my home. Reminds of what their priorities are. Too much goes against them ending
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui I'm still hopeful it's going to be a reconnection at the wedding. Finding out what it means to be
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui it's gonna hurt. And April's gonna feel every bit of it :(
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui I could see it.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui unless something big goes down in OR that pushes him well over the ledge
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui be surprised but not hate him for needing time. I don't know just not the J we've seen
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui I can't even see it tho. I can't see Jackson turning her down if she wants to work it out. I will
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui falling out. All offscreen. I would be absolutely pissed.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui same otherwise it just takes a giant dump on who they WERE. For what? We didn't even see the
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly @ouafaealaoui it would be too much for me too.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui my biggest fear is April agreeing it's not working. Then I die.
@JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui @1crightonly to her marriage and wants to fix it, I can roll with whatever.
@JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui @1crightonly I won't be mad or blame him if that's the case. Like I said as long as April sees what's happened
@JustaThought47 @ouafaealaoui @1crightonly think cliffhanger?
@ouafaealaoui 3lilbirdiesss
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 he still misses his wife, hoping she's still in there. Fearing she's gone for good.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly he's about to break. It's very obvious when I rewatch it. Rock star husbands hurt too.:(
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly their story has led them here.. Alex putting Mer first is gonna cost him Jo.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly don't you love that despite a year of the cold shoulder Jackson still only has eyes for April.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly all of which seem to be more important to Alex than Jo.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly she was all that's your house your stuff etc. More foreshadow. Writers might be more clever than we think
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly ALSO.. remember that scene where Jo freaks out about not having a home, Alex reassures her its him and her.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I have high hopes for April telling Jackson he's her home. High high hopes.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 deep down April loves her husband more than anything. She just needs a reminder.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly they are definitely due for proper drama.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly the way Alex acted when Mer was gone and they showed Alex Maggie together more in 22 than Jolex during that yr
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly ing. Japril have much better shot at resolution
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly look at it this way, the only way Jolex problems get resolved is if Alex puts Jo before Mer. That's not happen
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I see Jo leaving under the guise of a "break " and coming back for more than what she bargained for
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Totally see a Jo/A/M triangle. Show hasn't had one in a long while.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly expect him to fall for Maggie while she is gone.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yeah I can't see a "wait for me" type thing for those two. If she goes, they're done. But I don't think she'd
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 exactly. He will think it's over over, she may be thinking temporary break up. Then bam,sorry I'm with Maggie
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly things will get complicated
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly oh I think it will be a break up, not just her leaving. But when she comes back and he's moved on with Maggie
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Jo chooses to leave? Alex gets free pass to move on with Maggie.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Shonda is dying to go there with Maggie and Alex. She needs Jo out of the way so Alex isn't too much of a dick
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Think it sets up well for Maggie/Alex/Jo in 12.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly that ties to the press release. Even Jo gets a happy ending because she's putting herself first.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Mer at home with Alex and Maggie. Steph and her new boy bonding. Owelia sharing a moment.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly that's why I sorta feel everyone will get happy ending but Jolex. Japril fight to make it work. Calzona do it.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Ironically Maggie is my favorite of all the airtime hoggers
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly same here. I used to like Amy but this season has changed that a bit.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Yeah that could be it. Wedding sex.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 he's so cocky and always right. It's annoying. And Owelia are just so forced. Fast forward material
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 it's pretty much all downhill from here lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly someone has to do it in the finale, better be them lol I can only handle so much naked Owen.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly oh yeah and whatever Owelia are doing. I cannot stand Owen I swear. Ugh.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly April being like oh thank god he's not giving up on me let me show you how much I freaking love you baby.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 talk about waking April up, losing Jackson would kill her and she'd fight and I need to see it so bad.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 imagine that passion tho after both thinking it's over for a while.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly could see the car patient resolved by mid episode, rest of time devoted to main cast
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly picture this.. Alex, Mer, Mag hanging with kids, Jo boarding a plane, Calzona hanging out, Japril makeup sex
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 especially after seeing Alex moved Mer in. She'd go just to prove a point. Jo is stronger than that.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 to see him to talk to him since he left. Here I go writing fanfic in my head lol
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 could be Jackson takes off for a little bit after talking to April. Comes back for wedding. She's been waiting
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and they didn't give her any interns, pretty telling
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly she was super excited about it, I really think she will go.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly so yeah time jump seems likely. Poss two weeks to tie into Jo leaving with the next group of doctors
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly that's why time jump, at least 2 weeks makes sense. But not sure
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly but how they go from mama a given the ring back to getting married I dunno
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly def think it's their wedding, Webbers tuxedo shirt gives it away.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly probably avoiding each other because it's gotten so strained.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly like for real tho, she probably does. Work work work. Next fix. Keep moving. No feeling.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly you think there's a bit of a time jump to Wavery wedding? Couple weeks or so
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I can deal with her badass self professionally but personally she needs to dial it back a notch or 2000
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 oh same here. He needs to know he's still wanted, needed, loved.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly As would I. This April doesn't fit with Jackson at all. Seeing Japril fans all happy about her make me like wtf
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly a shit about her husband/marriage when she returned. But hey, people change. Lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I can't believe they'd even try to end. Japril like that. Well one day April went to the army and didn't give
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly about him/them isn't his wife. He shouldn't have to just roll with that
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly a Jackson can handle badass April. It would probably turn him on. But cold isn't his wife. Seemingly uncaring
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 she looks creepy for sure. Shes 100% still in army mode. All business. No feelings. High adrenaline.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 how much is my heart going to burst when Jackson gets a big dose of love?? He needs it so bad.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if we didn't see that clip of her crying I'd be waaaay more paranoid lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm judt happy to see her crying in the promo. Something cracks her walls. And that can only be a good thing
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yup she found a coping mechanism. Not feeling anything.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly like you said earlier, she hasn't accepted Samuel's death yet. Her call with Jackson at Christmas showed that
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 one year as a dr in the army can't kill 32 years of personality. I don't care what anyone says.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yeah I don't think they looked beyond the badass surface to see what's really going on with her
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly perky funny April. In love with Jackson April. Just gone? I can't accept that.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yes! And they can't just make April Yangx3 and say here's new April. She's basically in a feelings coma.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly remain cold and not feeling anything? Why would you want that for her.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly see people saying she's here to stay and we'll have to accept it or not lol. Do they actually want her to
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly people can evolve and not be completely different. 23 April is not true April.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 that's not even taking her religious beliefs into account. Did those disappear with New April too? Can't see it
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Shonda ain't above doing anything evil. Always better to proceed with caution
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly April is still April. She will fight for her marriage.it would be TOO OOC for her to just let Jackson walk.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly add Bill Harper. The title. The release. The voice overs. I'm nervous in a good way
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm usually not so optimistic but I think 24 has the makings to be an epic Japril episode
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly the title means something for them. It has to
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly  please tv show gods.. let this be great.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly i mean Thursday lol getting ahead of myself
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I expect two big moments tomorrow
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly that's why I'm so hopeful, he's got to really put it all out there for her to make this big declaration
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I hope we get to see a lot of the wedding. With everyone dressed up seems we at least a small glimpse
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yes that's the way it should go. April telling J he is her home and she wants to come home <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 this one they have in 24 is more  necessary  and relevant. Hope they do it justice
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I've watched that ONCE the night it aired lol hell no it was brutal
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Alex has shifted priorities and there's no way he's shifting back by the end of 24. He doesn't want to.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly can see the end with Alex hanging out with Mer, kids n Maggie, Jo boarding a plane. Japril hopefully doing it.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly exactly April at least has reasons to be acting this way, Alex just gives no fucks.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 exactly. Why would Jo just put up with that? It would make her spineless IMO.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Jolex aren't married and have no reason to fight for their relationship.Alex doesn't seem like he'd fight neway
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly at an Avery wedding. I can see April looking at J, Mama A and Webber thinking I should be with them.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 he was very "whatev" about it.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it does. April fighting for her man, Jackson setting his bruised ego aside to accept her apology
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if I was Jo, I'd end it too. She's clearly not a priority for him anymore
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Alex doesn't seems to care much about Jo anymore :/
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly so I fully expect Japril to find out what it means to be Averys too.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly seems Shonda wasn't lying at the beg of the season.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly we thought it was just stupid pointless angst, but Jo literaly losing Alex to Mer would fit.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly no worries part 2 will bring my emotions back hahaha
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it was very cathartic for me lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly they may make it seem like Japril are thru the whole episode but in the end Japril survive, Jolex sink.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I will be shocked if Jolex end this season on good terms. Shocked
@1crightonly it's a two shot, second part will be April's big move
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 I dunno you tell me dun dun dun 
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 can't help myself, have to write a one shot
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 come on April.. don't let Jackson down. Don't let us down.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 totally. If this isn't mending by the end of the finale, I will be so pissed.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 you're my home. You're my home. You're my home. Keep repeating lol
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 otherwise what the hell are we shipping?  She literally tossed him aside and never looked back.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 after everything he's been through, that's the very least that should happen.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 refuse to watch. My expectations are low. Just want to see April realize what J means to her.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 Shonda better not F this up. She already lost viewers because of Derek. If she screws Japril I
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly I think Jolex is in trouble. I think they break up.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly there's no way I can even fathom her just letting her marriage go easily. No way.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly ended up hurting him very badly/then not caring that she did? They can't change April that much
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly I will be really really sad for Jackson if that happens. Waits all this time for a woman who
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly make it. She can't give the ending away
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly SDs tweet was in reference to the finale only I think. We don't know right now if they will
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly that sucks but have a nice life, soldier.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly It definitely seems like it should go that way. I can't see her just being like oh really? Ok
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly At least I hope.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly Honestly I see it working out before the finale ends. I think April will fight for him.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly yeah sounds about right. As long as it's before the end of the episode I think it's all good.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly no definitely not. What she said at Christmas definitely showed that.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly badass doctor doesn't have to  mean cold woman.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly that's what she did. Her wall needs to crumble.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly That's running and hiding within yourself. Creating a wall where you don't feel any pain.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly badass isn't equivalent to cold and unfeeling. That's my issue with new April.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly profesdionally, yes. But April as April.. she is NOT ok.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly she didn't grow. She's supressing her emotions. It's not healthy.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly kinda like OWEN did. I hate that MFer. Not even sorry
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly esp if she just runs over him in the OR war mode, stealth style
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly guy lived! Jackson, my man! Come here boo! And he's all nah. I can't do this anymore.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly Could be just as she starts coming back to life, he's reached his limit. She kisses him like yes
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly J is def not into that kiss that's for sure. He looks defeated.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 that's what I'm saying. Too much sadness to end sadly. Table has to turn.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly I think she's gonna trample him in the OR and not even realize it.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly if G I Joe doesn't snap out of it I can't be mad at Jackson for being done <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly all he wants is his wife back. That's obvious. If she doesn't wake up.. I don't even know
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly the only way Japril split is if she doesn't wake up. Jackson will not turn her down of that I am sure.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly intentionally screwing her marriage, Alex just doesn't seem to care about if him and Jo work.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and he doesn't have the excuse April has, he didn't lose a child and then suppress all his emotions. April isnt
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Alex doesn't seem to care much about Jo at all anymore, now he's moving an entire family in she's odd man out
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly luckily they already got a heartbreaking cliff mid season. They are due for peace
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly really believe Jolex are ending this time.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly If it's Japril, as long as his feelings are on the table and she is upset they are ending, I can deal. But I
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly doesn't give a damn after he tells her how hurt he is, that's not April. Or Japril. Or my show.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I can't believe she just doesn't care about Jackson or her marriage anymore. That's not April. If she still
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Mer was her bubble popping. Her bubble has to pop or else the story doesn't vibe at all.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I don't see that happening at all. This is leading up to April's bubble popping. Like Amelia going off on
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly but her not accepting responsibility in what she has done to Jackson and their marriage, I will not be ok.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly the VoiceOvers, the title or the press release. Even if he's not sure he wants to try (which I doubt) I'd be ok
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly the only thing that would make me throw in the towel is her not waking up. And they doesn't vibe with the story
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly until the wedding. She goes with a mission, she's not letting Jackson go.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly either way, think kiss comes before the tears. It's gonna rock her world. They don't speak or see each other
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and that she is sorry.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly the impossible.. getting Jackson to believe her when she says she's still in it, she wants him and needs him
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly her away and be like no.. We're not fine. At all.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I could see her not taking him seriously at first, goes to kiss him like see! We're okay. And then he pushes
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly a pretty healthy dose of reality in that crying clip.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Yup :( and his lid will finally pop. I don't think it's gonna be pretty either. April looks like she's getting
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly especially after getting trampled by Owen in the OR the same day. He's gonna reach his limit.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm waiting on pins and needles. I need it!!!
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Yeah I could see her trampling over him in the OR total war zone mode. And that being his final straw.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 when they are saving the guy. Ambulance bay, April crying afterwards
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 yeah but there are ones separate of Jesse and Sarah both with blood on them. Think this pic and those pics are
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 seems the ambulance bay is after all that.. Once the dude is saved.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 think they are in the OR together or operate together given April and Jackson both have blood all over them.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly we'll have an awesome kid, be amazing parents... *cry*
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly damn imagine that delivery scene tho. All the feels in the world.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it's just the only way it can go IMO. Giving them their baby.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly having a healthy baby is the only way Japrils story can end when Greys ends.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly pregnant by mid season. Baby in finale.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it's been full tilt boogy since they found out they were pregnant. Tome for some peace and joy for them.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly tears from both. Both at the ambulance bay and atbthe wedding
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Maybe I am too optimistic today but I feel 12 has to be happy Japril. They've been sad for too long.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 yeaaaah lol I'm here for it. But I do want them to be  in private when she tells him her feelings.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I desperately need to see her fight for him and them. Just one scene will go so far.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I'd actually like them to be in a private room to talk so we can get a passionate embrace after.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly getting her man back.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yeah surprised new April takes the time to go. But if Jackson woke old April up she could go w the intention of
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 for her baby boy.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Me too!! I am looking forward to Jackson/Mama at the wedding esp if he and April split. She will  feel so bad
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 actually I could see a speech.. one that indirectly ties to everyone's situation, given its the finale.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Jackson as maid of honor is gonna be too cute. Holding her flowers lol giving the speech (prob off screen)
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 It would be great wouldn't it? Nice little surprise. Give J an out that he ultimately turns down.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if Harper isn't there that's total laziness on writers behalf. He and Catherine are tight.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 decides he's not gonna do what she did and run. He will fight for them too.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Harper offering Jackson something in Boston and telling him to consider it, then April finally shows up and he
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I see something great for them at this wedding. Wonder if Harper will be there? Lazy writing if not. Could see
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if Jo shared a significant scene with Jackson in 23 I would have been concerned but not so much anymore
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 doesn't seem they're going that direction thankfully
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 the year time jump made it possible. J being lobely with no one to talk to. Jo kinda in the same boat.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly wedding.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly April looking longingly at Jackson as he stands by his mother as she says her vows, reminding her of their
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly April shows up at the end and convinced him to not give up on them. Jolex split in shocking last minute.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I could see J laying it out, two weeks pass, Wavery wedding. J has been avoiding April. Longing during wedding
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yup my thoughts exactly. If things look done with them in the middle they are safe by the end.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yes it crossed my mind too, esp w Jo working on burn patients.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly during the episode, then they makeup and Jolex split.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly he might be kissing her goodbye til she gives her big declaration at the end. It'll seem like Japril are thru
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Jackson wasn't and isn't interested in anyone but his wife. If only she'd come back to him.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly vibe with the story arc IMO
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly doesn't seem Jo picked a specialty yet but I can only see Jo/Jackson if April doesn't wake up. Which doesn't
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly or anyone. She'd just be doing somethkng for herself as a single woman. She's not in the middle of mourning.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly she's lost in the crowd. Think the army would be good for her actually. She wouldn't be running from anything
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly having issues with Jackson, I'd be even more worried
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it was OBVIOUS April is not okay. So that's good for us. If she came back as a badass and still April but STILL
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yeah but it was prob fun to play, and once she finds balance in her personal life, badass A can stay
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 when he became close to Maggie.. when he lost Mer for a year. His priorities have shifted it seems
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly meanwhile SD plays coy because she knows Japril make up. Wants to keep it exciting.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly translate to character happiness
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly actors are prob excited for something NEW for Jolex, a shake up. We've learned actor excitement doesnt
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly those are typical from those two. Camilla always more fangirly. I don't think it means anything. Plus the
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Mer is home for Alex. Not Jo. That says enough right.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 It was her mom. Parents cheating, divorcing, something like that??
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 not just make assumptions based on her OOC behavior and persona
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 yup. Can my man Jackson Avery get some POV love damn. April too for that matter. Want to hear her feelings
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly gives Alex time to move on with Maggie then Jo comes back in 12.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Japril looks to be the one splitting so they'll make up. Jolex will be the breakup. Imo
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly they do and it's obvious Maggie &gt;&gt; Jo for Shonda.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 don't see Jo being happy with any of it. I say she goes overseas.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 is Maggie living there too??
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Jo is only gonna tolerate being second/third to Alex for so long
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yeah right. No way is Jolex getting engaged. They are on very rocky footing. Mer moving in will be final push
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 least SOME hsppiness. Damn.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 maybe season 12 will be the season of happiness for them. They've had a rough few years. Everyone else gets at
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 shit I've ever  seen
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 after everything that's happened, if Japril don't get a semi happy ending this season is the most depressing
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 they've kinda been off all season. They are due for a break up. Everyone else has to go thru it.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 way. And she'll realize she is wrong. Jackson IS her family.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 just because they lost a child doesn't mean they aren't still a family. I feel like she thinks this in some
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 realizing they are a team, a family, and she needs him. She can't keep pushing him away.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 no Jo will be back in 12, but she'll prob come back to Alex and Maggie hooking up.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if you think about it.. this could all tie back to finding out what it means to be Averys.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly meanwhile Jolex break up and Jo heads overseas.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 YES YES YES. He has gotten the raw end of the deal for too long. He needs that apology.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly stay speech.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly i could see longing during the wedding, Jackson preparing to move on, and then April giving this big please
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly maybe its a couple weeks after he lays it out. She's had time to process what has happened to her life.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly on them, how much she loves him and needs him, he is her home.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Catherine and Webber do their vows, Jackson's speech. April pulls him to the side and asks him not to give up
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I still see some epic scene at the wedding. Not in front of everyone but after the ceremony. After watching
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm gonna love it because I NEED it at this point. Their relationship is far too one sided these days.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 It's gonna kill him to hurt her but he can't continue the way  it's been.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly could go eithet way story wise. But I'm thinking You're My Home will have something to do with Japril 4 sure.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly thing I won't tolerate.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and it's her turn to show him what he means to her, I can deal with that. Her just not caring would be the one
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm good with either I guess. If he just accepts her apology and wants it to work I am good. If he's had enough
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly optimism and perky and shiny April makes her who she is. I don't want another jaded Cristina Yang.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 she's in there somewhere. He's just gonna have to emotionally beat her out I think.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly because most of the Japril fans are April fans first. I'm Japril fan first so I hated it
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I think Jo goes too. Comes back next season to Alex and Maggie hooking up.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Jackson's all I didn't sign up for G. I. Joe. Lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm glad not everyone thinks 23 April is super awesome. Work wise. Yes. As a human being?? No.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and assuming we haven't been misreading the last 4 years, Jackson means everything to her.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yeah i can't picture 23 April with Jackson at all :/ I can only imagine how weird it is for him.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly plus like you said, Webbers speech.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 her army trip benefited her professionally but that's it. It gave her the wrong coping mechanism
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 he said I'm happy she's found something that makes her happy.. I guess??? Hahaha
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 pain
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 she probably told him it makes her happy when really it just makes her feel nothing. And thats better than the
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 else to make her happy (cept not really)
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 she doesn't appear to be in it anymore with him. He thinks they no longer matter to her. She's found something
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 tip toeing* it'd be so random for her to wake up and tell him what he means to her and him be like sorry bye
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 and things have beem ugly this whole time maybe, but they've been tio toeing around it it seems
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 hell they could go there but it's lame. The J Avery they write wouldn't turn her down. If they've been fighting
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I imagine it's pretty heartbreaking to think your wife no longer wants or needs you. He's just so lost.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I agree which is why a will he/won't he cliff doesn't work. Duh. Of course he will. Lol
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Yes otherwise this story falls so flat and Jackson's officially April's backup singer. They won't be equals.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly at this point would've already bailed. But not Jackson. He loves her too much.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if she wakes up, acknowledges his feelings, wants them to work then I can't see him ending things. Most guys?
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly they've got to give him one shining moment once this season. Just not right?
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly wifeys back. Onward and upward lol. Ugh I will be mad!!
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly all out for her and if thats overlooked for her own wake up call Im gonna be so pissed. Then he's just like yay
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I hate how this story makes me feel so strongly one sided for Jackson but he's earned his right to just let it
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and not Js feelings I won't be impressed.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I certainly hope not. Maybe a dent in it before Jackson gives her the low down. But if that's her big ah-hah
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly no way he'd tell her his feelings if she's having a huge breakdown of emotions already, least I cant see it :(
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly epiphany is all it takes, Js feelings swept under the rug again.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly feelings out to her if she's already crying. That's not J. And I will feel ripped off if her having a solo
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly she is looking at someone, listening to someone when she's crying. I have a hard time seeing him laying his
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 something breaks her&amp; it's gotta be Jackson. After what she's experienced I can't see it being a dying patient
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly there's def a talk between them and it's been set up for it to come to a head, however it plays
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly as a Jacksom fan
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly my biggest fear is it's HER who says its not working but I can't see that happening. That would devastate me
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly April crying tho. That is my strongest hope that it goes this way. Something big has to break her.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yup. No one, not even himself, was caring for him or his needs and now it's about to explode
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly there is no them. Hasn't been a them in a year. :(
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 and I could see her being totally shocked, not even see it coming. Her bubble blinded her.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Damn Jackson needs a major break. This guy has had the worst year and a half.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Jackson's always getting one upped in the OR smh
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm wondering if she straight up de-balls him in the OR in Soldier Robot mode and he can't take it anymore
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 now imagine this April trying to interact with J. Im sure he's just like WTF.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 they've been writing would turn her down after she sees the light. So it'd be a lame cliff lol
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 If they showed him more fed up than they did in 22/23 I could see that as a cliff, but there's no way the J
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 not to say there won't be problems in 12!
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I'm not sold on that 100% think they will actually come together in finale.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly her telling the others not to get their hopes up about any survivors. Just cold as ice. Damn
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and hopefully Jackson still has enough to give when she does. That's our question IMO
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly our April would have been with J and mama A. She can't break out of war mode.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly pushing her away like no, this isn't gonna fix it.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly could be that's her in an attempt to show him thst she's still there. He doesn't look into it st sll :/ kinda
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 kinda seems they're living together alone. Know what I mean.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly even register to April things are off lol who knows
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I think they've been tiptoeing around each other and the elephant in the room. Or maybe it really doesn't
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly doesn't sell me they've been making love with robot Apes
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I don't think so. Couples w this big of an issue aren't getting it on. We can agree to disagree. The relief hug
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it's sad they aren't on the same page, ever. I hated when he said that
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly J wouldn't want to have emotionless sex with his wife IMO
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly 23 April is who got off the plane. Reunion sex maybe but there hasn't been much action since, if then.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly she didn't come home as the loving affectionate wife that's for sure.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly from the get go. She didn't just gradually bevome the girl in 23 after she got home, she came back that way
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly unless it was immediate awkward haven't seen you in a year soooo hey. How are ya? Things could have been off
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly not feeling anything includes desire, love, etc.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was no intimacy between them. How could there be, talk ab awkward lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yup I want an epic breakdown from her.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 married to him anymore. That they no longer make sense to her.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 esp when Owen said things that once made sense, don't anymore. He might even be thinking she doesn't WANT to be
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly for 2 epic scenes
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly he has and I hope they both get a speech. They have to have her explain herself, her grief expressed. Hoping
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly if that clip of April crying says anything.. he's not holding back.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I need Jesse to get some killer material after playing the supportive spouse all season
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly hoping their talk gives us more insight
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly so now he just finally blows
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly maybe he's been trying to talk to her in a delicate way about it and she's been shutting him down.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly laid out there
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm thinking it's intentional so the big show down if you will is that much more impactful. ALL of his feelings
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 year now. He's gotta just be heartbroken.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 yes this!! She's always 1st to him which is great until it starts hurting him. He's been sad and alone for a
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly prob wasn't doing much bonding
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Oh I'm almost certain some soldier she bonded with is in our future. But maybe not. Cold heartless April
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly right again or Jackson's done being in this by himself
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly they are at a breaking point imo.. do or die. She's either gotta show up and want to make her marriage right
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 holding it in will only make it worse, and you're right.. make  him resent her
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 It's def what she needs to wake up from the emotional coma she put herself in. And he needs to get it out.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 but sometimes you have to speak your heart even if it hurts
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 he needs to realize he's not doing them either any favors by keeping it to himself. He wants to never hurt her
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 at this point I will settle for Jackson getting to lay out his feelings. Give the man a POV.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly and can he please get a MFing apology. For the love April you're killing me smalls lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I need to see it, I need to see her realize how much she stands to lose
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 YES! She's in total war mode still. It's like she's high off of not feeling anything if that makes any sense
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 when he told Owen I'm happy she found something that makes her happy.. I guess. Like even he sees she's not.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly her crying can only mean good things IMO it means she's woke up.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Mer to Alex about being back but not home.. totally Japril.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly She's supressing all of her emotions, including the good ones. That's what the army did for her.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Yes exactly. But the hardened shell has to go. Or she's gonna lose her man over it :(
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I don't either. I need my sweet, light, shiny, madly in love with Jackson April to show up
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly entirely diff person than he married? A cold, hard, unfeeling machine? No. He has to snap her out of that.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly that's why I don't get people saying people change and J should just accept it. Why should he accept an
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Agreed. Not a fan of cold, unfeeling April. She can keep the badassness, but the personality 180? No
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly has reached his limit.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly He's too careful with her feelings, even now to his own detriment. Doesn't want to upset her. But I think he
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly which is a perfect lead in to April having a big declaration of what J means to her
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 granted he will ALWAYS be there but this is going to make her wake up.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 I think it's going to crush her when she realizes what's become of her marriage. I think she takes it for
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly they had midseason cliff tho. So hopefully they get peace. You're my home.
@1crightonly @JustaThought47 Jolex is so splitsville IMO. Mer moving in is going to be the final straw.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I agree. I think Jackson is about to rock her world with a dose of reality. Wake her emotions up.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly April needs to show up in a major way. Her time for that big love declaration
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly agreeing they are too important to give up on.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I think Jolex split too. I think Japril will get a happy ending. Not meaning all is well, but both of them
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly home. A peaceful ending to a chaotic heartbreaking season.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly it's too much/obvious for them to split. Them reconnecting makes more sense to me. April telling J he is her
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly yes and at night. I think it's close to the end, but they get one more solo scene at the end/wedding
@1crightonly actions have done to her marriage and want to fight for him and them
@1crightonly totally could be but for some reason I feel they will be semi-reconnected by the end. At least us seeing April realize her
@1crightonly We know they operate together maybe badass April de-balls him in the OR and he finally snaps
@1crightonly marriage. If she asks him to work it out, he's not gonna say no. Not the guy I've been watching.
@1crightonly He just wants his wife back. If she sees the light I can't see him turning her away. He's just tired of being alone in their
@1crightonly she will do, then at the end she comes to him, probably at the wedding, and apologizes and tells him how much she loves him.
@1crightonly what do you think will go down this week? I think Jackson tells her how he feels in the promo and we are left to wonder what
@michelebolam I think his tone, his words, him being done, exhausted, and just done.. it's all gonna scare her
@michelebolam self and that is his breaking point. It's gotta be !!!! for her to wake up. Just a we need to talk.. ain't gonna work.
@michelebolam No i think it's more than that. I think he possibly ends things. Perhaps she tries to de-ball him in the OR with her badass
@michelebolam He is. I am almost certain that clip of her crying is him telling her.
@michelebolam I can't see April waking up and smelling the coffee only for Jackson to be like sorry, too late.
@michelebolam I think she will be heartbroken when she realizes what she has put him through.
@iShipJapril absolutely crushed Jackson and might even lose him will bring OUR April back out. I sure hope so.
@iShipJapril And we will see that cold, unfeeling, badass soldier April isn't as cold and unfeeling as she wants to be. Realizing she has
@iShipJapril I think just realizing how much she has hurt him will devastate April.
@iShipJapril His face after that convo with Owen looked to me like.. screw that.
@iShipJapril Jackson deserves all the slack in the WORLD at this point. Poor guy.
@iShipJapril Pay super close to the voice-overs.. very telling what's going on with April and what might happen with Japril.
@iShipJapril Owen telling him to give her time. WTF? I seriously can't stand that cocky MFer.
@iShipJapril trying to show Jackson how much HE means to her, then I am just fine with angst and drama.
@iShipJapril However it doesn't jibe with the press release or title of the episode. Anyway.. as long as the tables turn, and it's APRIL
@iShipJapril There's only so much one person can handle. Most men, husbands, would have bailed already. He has the patience of a saint.
@iShipJapril And honestly after everything he has been through, I cannot fault him at all for reaching the breaking point.
@iShipJapril talking about. How it takes another tragedy to wake you up and face reality. This will be April's. Losing Jackson.
@iShipJapril I think Jackson will end things and it will be the wake up call she needs. Pop her bubble.. the bubble Mer's voiceover was
@iShipJapril Who knows why she does the things she does. lol
@iShipJapril fix it. Or see we're fine! See. Kiss. And he's all..no. We're not.
@iShipJapril throw in the towel. However, during the kiss, it looks like Jackson might be pushing her away.. like she thinks the kiss will
@iShipJapril The promo looks like April is ending things. Of course they are always misleading, but if THAT were to happen.. I'd have to
@iShipJapril on the outs, indefinitely.
@iShipJapril Or even after he tells her how he feels, she still doesn't understand the depth of the destruction on her marriage, and they're
@iShipJapril to fight and get him back.. whether he comes back or not is the cliff. Or they end up making up in the finale.
@iShipJapril Them taking a break to see how things go.. not dramatic enough. He either ends things, she realizes she messed up and wants
@iShipJapril the roses. Maybe he tells her he is moving out.
@iShipJapril I don't see how a break would be helpful though. They've been on a break essentially. I know see how that would help her smell
@iShipJapril out. Letting her know what the last year has done to him.. to them. And that he can't do it anymore.
@iShipJapril In the promo of her crying.. she looks almost guilty. Like he's giving her some tough love at that time. Laying his feelings
@michelebolam Jolex need to break up. If only for a while. They need some angst. REAL angst.
@iShipJapril For April to wake up and smell the roses.
@iShipJapril separated for a year. Is a "break" going to really do any good?? I think it's got to be a WHAMMY holy shit.. I'm losing him.
@iShipJapril See I am thinking if he's gotten to his breaking point.. it's like I'm out. Out, out. Done. Because they've basically been sep
@iShipJapril I am hoping she is still in there, and she shows Jackson how much he means to her.
@iShipJapril She isn't the woman he married or fell in love with. Or the one I fell in love with for that matter.
@iShipJapril a fan of new unfeeling April. She has got to find a balance.
@iShipJapril It seems her marriage/Jackson are not even on her radar. She's hard as steel.. cold.. unfeeling. All about business. I am not
@iShipJapril like.. it's too late. So I don't know!
@iShipJapril But the thing is.. if April does come around and wakes up and wants to make it right.. I have a hard time seeing Jackson being
@iShipJapril actions may have just cost her her husband.
@iShipJapril Yeah. So I am holding tight. My only hopes is that Jackson gets to lay his feelings out there, and April realizes how her
@iShipJapril telling her that it's not working anymore.. gonna completely rock her world. The reality check she desperately needs.
@iShipJapril Yeah.. she's not at all even thinking her marriage is in shambles. She is focused on business and business alone. Jackson
@iShipJapril to indicate maybe she is realizing that by escaping her reality, she may have lost the person that means the most to her.
@iShipJapril and realizes how her actions have negatively affected him and their marriage remains to be seen. Her crying in the promo seems
@iShipJapril I feel like Jackson has reached his limit. I fully expect him to lay it all out there for her next week. Whether she wakes up
I'm officially scared for Japril. I TOLD YOU GUYS HER GOING TO THE ARMY WAS A BAD IDEA!
@michelebolam If she doesn't see what has happened to her marriage and husband and/or doesn't care.
@michelebolam The only way I see a Japril split is if April doesn't take responsibility for her actions and how she has hurt Jackson
@michelebolam One couple could be Catherine and Webber.. big decision to make.. they decide to get married. Good news
@michelebolam No.. a baby isn't going to fix what's broken.
@michelebolam Good news could just mean that they make up.
@michelebolam Jolex need to sink.. they've been light and drama free the entire time they've been together.
@michelebolam So either Jolex or Japril surive
@michelebolam Jackson's face indicated he is done with giving her time.
@michelebolam She is in for a heavy duty wake up call. Jackson has reached his limit.. and rightfully so.
@michelebolam I think she's too preoccupied in her bubble to really consider it. She's focused on business and business alone.
@michelebolam for 10 years and is married to him. She should KNOW that his feelings have got to be in shambles after the past year
@michelebolam I was telling Tracy the same thing. Yeah maybe he should be more vocal, but April is a grown ass woman who has known this man
@michelebolam  I feel you. Maybe losing Jackson will wake up up. Snap her back to reality.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 have to start unfollowing soon.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 the people more preoccupied with Stone Cold April Austin than with Japril falling apart blow my mind. Gonna
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Mainly because they don't allot Japril enough screen time to properly tell the tale.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 intended for April to leave.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Perhaps the story wasn't fleshed out the way it was intended due to Derek's death, but I think she always
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 But that was before all the PD drama went down. I think this was always their journey.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 I don't think so necessarily.. Shonda said they'd be looking "elsewhere" clearly she meant April, not they.
@AmandaSnB @newf93 @divaofdfw No it wouldn't have. These lunatics are grasping for the smallest of straws with this rape shit. It's pathetic
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Yeah Sarah's "cling to each other to heal" seems a bit bogus now lol
@newf93 @AmandaSnB @divaofdfw Do they really think if Liz told Jake that night he was Jason, that would have stopped him from wanting her?
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 And since Jackson isn't having any problems knowing what his priorities are (her and them) it's gotta be her.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 priorities should be.. something to that affect.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 But the PR for 24 does say this tragedy makes the doctors realize what is important in life, where their
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 I know. She has basically all but forgotten about Jackson/her marriage/their partnership. Not a priority
@newf93 @AmandaSnB YES he certainly did.
@newf93 @AmandaSnB known from the get go he was Jason and went after him as "Jake" then that'd be on thing. But she already wanted Jake.
@newf93 @AmandaSnB Also I think the fact that Liz fell for Jake prior to knowing he was Jason makes it a lot less creepy, you know? Had she
@AmandaSnB @newf93 Trust when I say Jake was MORE THAN WILLING to bump uglies with Lizzie. MORE than. lol
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 which is totally not healthy at all, but plausible.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 should have a son right now.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 to be the three of them. Maybe she's pushing Jackson and her emotions away because he reminds her that they
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 plus at Christmas, right before she came home, she said that she can't think about the fact that it's supposed
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 than ever. You can go and get tough and become a badass and not lose who you are entirely.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Apparently Jackson Action didn't work. But neither did the army. Because she came back more unlike herself
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Yeah I don't know what the hell is going on in that head of hers. Hopefully she will explain herself in 24
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 And maybe give him some ass since he's been celibate for over a year lol
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 You could see it last night. He's at a loss. He's tapped out. :( I want to hug him.
@newf93 Sam effing her stepdaddy was pretty unethical too. Everyone in Port Charles is unethical lol
@JustaThought47 Well then I'd totally bawl. Her making a speech clearly directed at Jackson at Wavery wedding would kill me.
Smokin' hot!!! 
Too presh.  
And I'm DYING!!! Favorite movie EVER.  
@JustaThought47 April needs a big dose of reality man. Crack that hardened shell she's build around herself.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Maybe him throwing in the towel is exactly what she needs to wake up.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Jackson probably doesn't know what to do with such a cold, unfeeling April. Hell I don't know what to do w her
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 umm... that look said they're rarely together anymore.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Looks like they're just avoiding eachother. When Catherine said I thought April would be with you.. he was all
@newf93 Luckily this is a fucking soap opera and what Elizabeth did is SMALL POTATOES compared to others. Have many seats, morons.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 and further away to a point where he just can't do it anymore. I think he's about there.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 No.. not saying anything and waiting is only doing more damage to their relationship. It's pushing him further
Not surprising. Remember when Scum fans threw an actual baby shower for Tamara Braun when Morgan was born?? Loons.  
You crazy fools trying to say Liz raped Jake. You're too stupid for words. #GH
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 surgeon? She's gotta snap back to reality man. Because if she loses Jackson it's no one's fault but hers.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 She needs it badly. Badass or not, who wants April to go through life as a jaded, lonely, unfeeling badass
SO SWEET I CANNOT. 
Now this is adorable I don't care who you are.  
I'm shocked at the stupidity of Jasam fans trying to claim that was rape. Are you fucking serious right now???  
Holy shit.. seriously guys. It's a TV show. Pretty sure Jake looked willing and able lol  
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 He's nice and acquainted with lil Jack.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Damn Jackson has had to self-love for over a year now, poor guy. lol
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 You can see a little bit of guilt, at least to me in that small little clip
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 I'm not sure. All I know is her face when she's crying looks like she's getting a reality check from him.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 Talk about awkward. lol
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 I think we were right in assuming they have not been intimate since she's been back. How could they be???
@michelebolam Perhaps @JustaThought47 is right and he's telling her he can't do this anymore. That would certainly be a wake up call.
@michelebolam April crying gives me hope that Jackson is giving her a much needed wake up call.
@michelebolam or hasn't been thus far.
@michelebolam I think he just didn't want to confide in his mother about it. I think he'd LOVE to talk and fix this,but she's not interested
@michelebolam Running away doesn't solve anything. In this case.. it just made things worse. For her and for Japril.
@michelebolam I get she's an unfeeling badass now, all business but damn. What happened to my April?
@michelebolam Exactly, I am not seeing how this trip healed her at all. To me it seems to have made it even worse.
I like how the rest of the Full House cast just bypass all Mary-Kate and Ashley questions. Think they're too good for the show. Smh.
Yay!!!! 
@michelebolam like Jackson should jyst deal with it for the rest of all time. Fuck that. This isn't what he signed up for.
@michelebolam it's like no one gives a shit she's destroying him and them. But at least she's a hard ass, woohoo
@michelebolam she has to find a balance or she's gonna lose Jackson. And I wouldn't fault him at all :(
@michelebolam she can be a badass surgeon and still a good wife.. person.
@michelebolam plus badass April =;asshole April it appears. Um yay???
@michelebolam Jackson, at this point, is the only one I have any sympathy for. April used all hers up.
@michelebolam it seems most the fandom doesn't care about Jackson. Just April. They'd probably excuse her cheating too. It's ridiculous.
@michelebolam I've always sided with both, but this time I cannot excuse her treatment of him.
@michelebolam been
@michelebolam I really think he's giving her tough love in that promo when she's crying. It looks like she's realizing what a jerk she has
@michelebolam It's VERY obvious the majority of the japril fandom are April Fans First. I'm with Jackman on this all day.
@michelebolam thoughts 
Still reeling from my Japril thoughts and feelings. Poor Jackson tho. He's reaching his limit, that much is obvious. #GreysAnatomy
@iShipJapril dying to hear your thoughts
@ouafaealaoui @iJesseWilliams My husband would've been like where the fuck are you and what the fuck is up with you.
Jackson Avery is seriously the most patient husband on this whole planet like you don't even know! @iJesseWilliams  #GreysAnatomy
@SarahDrewGreys do you feel bad for Jackson? I do. It's like he lost his wife, BFF, person. I hope they can work it out. Love the hair btw!
Me :/ RT @carlybb: Mixed feels about this "new" April. I like that she's tougher but sad to see her lose her innocence and optimism. #Greys
Rewatching the episode for hints.. and listening to the voice overs.. plus the press release and title for 
@ouafaealaoui hoping April has some realization after she saves her patient and goes to Jackson crying and then they make up.
Dude Jackson has every right to be pissed at Owen for that stunt. Not just April.
Do we not understand Owen just went against the owner of the MFing hospital. #GreysAnatomy
Catherine taking up for Jackson was adorable.
@michelebolam damn now I need next weeks episode in a big way.
@michelebolam bigger balls. Lol
@michelebolam it's actually pretty good reading but just makes me even sadder. One said since when is Jackson a little bitch? And April has
@michelebolam do not search April and Jackson on here, it will give you anxiety haha
@michelebolam too many cheating theories out there, stop it twitter. I will fall over myself if she cheated. No way. Right??
@michelebolam maybe April realizes what she has done and goes to him apologizing. That's my first pick. Please for the love.
@michelebolam I'm so distraught as a Japril fan right now. Lol wtf man
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam But Jim Pickens is in a BTS pic in a tuxedo shirt. So I think they'll get married
@michelebolam the promo doesn't jive with the press release so I dunno. I'm really confused.
@michelebolam maybe in a twist she goes to him realizing she was wrong and he is her home and he's already at his limit? Or maybe.. maybe...
@michelebolam maybe the husband she's trying to save doesn't make it and it wakes up her up. I don't know man. Could go either way
@michelebolam God I hope it goes that way because if it's her realizing she's not in a place to be married I will fucking flip!!!
@michelebolam I dunno. Maybe were wrong and they're making amends? The title and PR swing it that way.
@michelebolam yeah if that happens I hope her attitude keeps her warm at night. Jackson deserves better.
@michelebolam to make him wait on her for year, come home and be a jerk, then end things?
@michelebolam I don't know anymore Michele :( but if she ends things with him.. He has my full support in moving on. Because that's so mean
@michelebolam Jackson hasn't had a best friend or person in a year. She left him.
@michelebolam why does she do anything she does these days :/
@michelebolam if SHE ends things, I am done.
@michelebolam I'm not sure where the hell it's going to be honest. If April ends things, I want him to move on. Because that's beyond fucked
@michelebolam that looked like crying because SHE was ending things. Could be off but that's my first gut reaction
@michelebolam yeah but they'll still get married lol
@michelebolam unless she's crying because he just told her how she's made him feel.
@michelebolam saw it. Looks like a break up kiss to me. And looks like it's of April's choice. Just a guess from what I saw.
@michelebolam Hope it's not a breakup kiss. Or hell I don't know what I want anymore this show is so fucked up lol
@michelebolam maybe Stone Cold April Austin will have her walls crumbled by this tragedy, I dunno.
@michelebolam crying while kissing or different scenes?
@michelebolam well fuck. Maybe I'll get lucky and it's after his big blow up. Any words??
@michelebolam no what did it have
Everyone still super excited April went off to heal herself?? No?? Yeah didn't think so.
@michelebolam doesn't give me fuzzy feelings
@michelebolam Alex is putting Mer first, forgetting about Jo. April puts.. well.. everything ahead of Jackson.
@michelebolam Jo and Jackson working together too.. not to jump to conclusions but they've both essentially been overlooked by their SOs.
@michelebolam yup this isn't his April. Isn't my April either. I wouldn't blame him for peacing out if she doesn't realize her mistakes.
@michelebolam also is it coincidence Japril and Jolex are headed towards splitsville at the same time? I mean..  I'm just saying.
@michelebolam be the perfect time for Papa A to show up. Abandonment issues delux.
@michelebolam nope. He didn't stand up for a woman who abandons him for a year and comes back stone cold and uncaring. This would actually
@michelebolam no he shouldn't be expected to just take it. Deal with it. That's not the woman he married.
@michelebolam or maybe she does push him awsy and he starts to move on and she realizes her mistakes.
@michelebolam if it's not him.. I dont know if I can keep shipping. That would make them WAY too one sided
@michelebolam I hope they are making her look selfish, unfeeling and stone cold on purpose.
@michelebolam it's not working instead, make him even more pathetic.
@michelebolam Can't even believe she's acting like this. He needs to tell her what the fuck is up. Knowing Greys they'll make HER tell him
@michelebolam she hasn't given shit in a year. Jackson deserves better than that. He's a damn good husband. Wtf
@michelebolam hell yeah. They're headed for separation if this isn't dealt with.
@michelebolam yeah fuck that gentle discussion shit. We're way past that now.
@michelebolam I want Jackson to explode. Angry Jackson is SO HOT and god if he ever had a reason to be pissed it'd be now
@michelebolam and she's not even an actual soldier. She's a fucking doctor who chose to go desensitize herself.
@michelebolam So glad she went. She TOTALLY needed it, right?? Give me a freakin break.
@michelebolam unfeeling self. Will she even care?? That's the question
@michelebolam he hasn't done anything to deserve this. I hope like hell he blows up at badass April. She can certainly take it with her new
@michelebolam this isn't her. It's not the April I fell in love with either. My April is better than this shit.
@michelebolam asshole badass April is gonna lose her rock star husband if she doesn't check herself.
@michelebolam Yup. Who cares about Jackson? Her husband? What's he got to do with anything.
@michelebolam give me a fucking break with that. Have fun with your badassness hope it keeps you warm at night after your husband getsfed up
@michelebolam this is gritty April x1000. This is asshole April.
@michelebolam She doesn't CARE. At all about if he understands or if they're okay.
@michelebolam I guess some people might like this new version. I definitely don't. She better find a middle ground.
@michelebolam Completely disregarding her marriage. Like she doesn't give a shit if it works out or not. Wtf???
@michelebolam probably roll her eyes and say okay, 10-4.
@michelebolam For sure. I hope he gets it all off his chest. And I really hope she feels like a real asshole. Old April would. This one?
@michelebolam This episode certainly didn't ease my anger with her that's for sure. I'm team Jackson in this. Not even sorry.
@michelebolam he shouldn't have to be okay with that. I hope he gives her a HUGE REALITY CHECK in the finale.
@michelebolam they seem to be avoiding each other at this point
@michelebolam in her personal life and professional life. Wonder how many folks are shaking their April needed to leave Pom poms now.
@michelebolam No but I think this is gonna be a huge issue to get through. April realizing her errors seems less likely.
@michelebolam so not only did last week happen, she comes back hard feeling and cold. Jesus if I was Jackson I would blow.
@michelebolam How anyone thought things would be good I have no idea.
@michelebolam She's just flat out cold. Not perky Kepner I love. Wtf
@michelebolam I actually hope they end it with Jackson telling her things are not fine, we are not fine. I don't know if we can fix it.
@michelebolam wouldn't blame Jackson at all for blowing up at this point.
@michelebolam She's not acting like I thought she would. She is legit stone cold now. How did this help again lol
@michelebolam he was cracking me up as maid of honor.. Lol
@michelebolam I foresee a huge blowup in the finale. Things are not gonna end well for them this season.
@michelebolam she's coming across bitchy.
@michelebolam I am not feeling April's new desensitized personality.
@michelebolam I guess I'll take comfort in things being disconnected although doesn't seem April thinks she did anything wrong.
@michelebolam So much for resolving it in the finale lol
@ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv @GreysABC this show is shit for continuity. Jackson and April never get any.
Seriously pissed. At least I have Dotty to always keep me warm.
@michelebolam committing**
@michelebolam Imagine the tension at Wavery wedding with them commuting their lives to each other meanwhile Japril are hanging by a thread
@michelebolam they might have a big blow in the finale. That'll be our cliffhanger.
@michelebolam It's sad is what it is.
Japril disconnected. Jackson taking his anger out on Owen. I suspect Japril might be the couple not getting happy finale this year.
Give April time? Are you fucking serious Owen. Get the fuck outta here.
YESSSSSS
I ain't mad at you Elizabeth. Get yours. Know that your time is limited before the shit hits the fan tho. #GH
Liz talking to Jason's picture. Uh ohs #GH
@newf93 Not because she boned him without telling him. He was certainly willing.
@newf93 He will be more pissed IMO about feeling like Liz just got with him because he was Jason and not for who he is now.
@newf93 Jake doesn't remember Jason. Knowing he's Jason wouldn't change his feelings for Liz.
@newf93 The jasammers are on crack. Lol
You and I felt natural.. almost familiar. Hahahahahaha #GH
On to Liason afterglow.. #GH
@lorloLauren Helena, Nikolas, Hayden and Liz. He's already BFF with Carly. Sonny doesn't like him. He's in love with Liz.
Well that was sweet and sexy. Liz is all ah, now I remember the D for sure. Should've done this sooner, I'd have known he was Jason. #GH
Isn't this basically Jakeson losing his virginity again? #GH
Awww this love scene is too much! #GH
TAKE IT OFF JAKESON!! #GH
@lorloLauren Helena told Nikolas a while back. Nik just told her.
Liz is in HEAVEN!! #GH
Ooooh here we go! Liason getting it on!#GH
Becky and Billy have such a charming chemistry together. Already my favorite Liz pairing ever. #GH
@lorloLauren shit. Shit will hit the roof.
@lorloLauren Nope. That's the drama. When everyone finds out she it gonna hit the roof.
Oh man Liz is like damn JASON! Get in me now #GH
@lorloLauren so she's keeping Jason for herself.
@lorloLauren she just found out. Was gonna tell everyone but decided Sonny Carly and Sam would take him away from her again.
I don't want you to leave. Hell no you don't girl!! Liz is gonna be like damn Jason went and got some moves in da bedroom #GH
Fast forwarding everything but Liason. Not even sorry #GH
Eeeeeeeee yeah let's get it on!!! #GH
@lorloLauren shit girl she just found it's Jason like Monday. She wanted him before but now she's like come to mama!!!!
And if this issue is swept under the rug.. Thank God it's hiatus so I can get unpissed by the lazy and shoddy writing.
@lorloLauren lol sweet my man gets some booty on today's show
@lorloLauren who gives a shit about some nobody Hayden? Should've made her an established character
@lorloLauren RB still looks smoking hot.
Gonna hurry and watch #GH while my offspring entertain themselves outside. Come to me Jakeson!!
@lorloLauren Ha!!! Ok I can roll with that. RB would've been perfect too.
That said I want them to work it out. It's the folks saying there's nothing to work out that kill me.
@lorloLauren I'd prefer her as Robin
@lorloLauren where is the lie tho. Lol.
On her marriage.
That April's actions have consequences. They were selfish and it while it made her a stronger person and better doctor, it also took a dump
No say in the past year of his life. What kind of relationship is that? Certainly not one I want. Or will ship. Peeps just need to accept
Sorry and a kiss will fix, I'm sorry but no. Not to mention her coming home as almost a different person than he married. He got absolutely
Spouses wishes without caring what it did to them or your marriage? He's just supposed to be OKAY with that? That's not something an I'm
wanting to punish her. Have you even lived real life? Been married? Do you know the damage it does to just leave for a year against your
Interesting people think Jackson still being hurt/angry/upset after his wife bounced on him for nearly a year is him just being mean and
@lorloLauren they missed the boat not making her Brenda or Robin.
#MetGala2015
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril I'd say that you are right to feel that way given what's happened
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril where the hell did that come from lol if anything she'll be messing with Jolex
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril It's not gonna be smooth sailing for them. For a while I'd imagine.
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril it's reacting to what's been presented on screen. I think I'll have a better grasp on my feelings after tonight
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 being an asshole for no reason. Fall out of love. Unless that happens I'm sailing this bitch.
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 the only way I'd ever jump ship is if one of them was being intentionally mistreated by the other. Cheating.
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril her better or not. If things aren't rocky and tense between them that would be so lazy and unrealistic.
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril but your damn right I want angst. She screwed Jackson and her marriage by doing what she did, whether it made
@autismteach11 @iShipJapril Why would you say were jumping ship? Of course not. Depending on how this goes down will determine what I want.
@iShipJapril beat me
@iShipJapril omg I am the same lol. I actually don't watch til after its aired and my kids are in bed, bout 8 central time. So you might
@ouafaealaoui yes but it won't be pretty.
@iShipJapril glad to have someone to discuss this with who is on the same page!
@iShipJapril I want him to be WTF to her new persona. Seriously hoping they haven't been intimate. That would really put a strain on things
@iShipJapril it's time for Jackson to shine. He's been her shadow all season. I want him to be mad. Hurt. To not know if they can survive it
@iShipJapril I can't take anymore silent Jackson just taking whatever April wants to throw at him. He needs a freaking voice.
@iShipJapril I'd really like to see April realize how badly she screwed her marriage up. Guarantee you the thought hasn't crossed her mind.
@iShipJapril as long as he gets a VOICE and a solid POV then I'm good.
@iShipJapril As long as Jackson gets a voice in this story I am all for it. However it turns out. Obviously I want them to work it out. But
@iShipJapril people better hold that 11x22 hug tight.
@iShipJapril agreed.. I'm more convinced now than before this is gonna get worse before it gets better.
@iShipJapril cuz that's all that matters.. lol. Aye aye aye. Gonna get some wine!
@iShipJapril April is better.
@iShipJapril see season 12 as them figuring out if they can make it work now. Wouldn't be surprised if Shonda adds 3rd parties. But hey at
@iShipJapril have to wait and see. Just want Jackman to get a POV.
Why do people think I am so upset she left for so long? Because this is what happens! A marriage is LUCKY to survive something like this.
@iShipJapril And Jackson has every reason in the world to not be okay with it. Hope Shonda's pro-women writing doesn't shit on him.
@iShipJapril Yup. I think it's gonna be a bumpy ride. She got better but at the cost of her marriage.
**Good intentions &gt; Unintended Co…
@iShipJapril now I'm thinking this is gonna be worse than expected. Going into S12/not knowing if they can make it.
So effing jealous of Elizabeth Webber right now. I see I'm not alone.. just for different reasons. Tap dat ass Liz! Tap it!!! #GH
Get you some Liz!!!! Haters gonna hate #GH
They are seriously saying that? Omg. Please reach a little further. Wtf  
Omggggg 
HOLY BALLS LIASON DID IT???? OMG My Jakeson got some ass woot woot finally #GH
Mo literally pimps whoever his couple is at the time and nothing more. I can't hate him.

@michelebolam How much disrespect/disregard is he supposed to be okay with?
@michelebolam Worse than I thought would be April not even caring if he's upset or mad. That would be the worst.
@michelebolam EXACTLY. How fucking Shonda Rhimes is that. lol
@michelebolam worse than what we thought.. Jackson no longer staying at home, but in his office at the hospital or something.
@michelebolam I hope we get even a little insight tonight to how things have been. Like I said yesterday, I wouldn't be surprised if it's
@michelebolam She just did. not. care. about what he felt or thought. I don't see how any Japril fan can see that as okay.
I bet Stephanie got a nice giggle that Jackson's wife, the one he left her for, left him alone for the better part of a year. #payback
@michelebolam want. This is what *I* want. That's not how marriage works. I'd be pissed if things WERE good between them after that.
@michelebolam Yup. Yup. Yup. April getting better and being happy is beside the point. The point is she basically said Fuck you and what you
@iShipJapril Jesus I sure HOPE so because the guy has been in the shadows being shat on all season long.
@michelebolam SHE didn't say I love you and talked to him like crap every time we saw her call so what-the-fuck-ever.
@iShipJapril Perfect time for Papa A to show up I think. "Why does everyone always leave me?" That's gotta be Jackson's inner voice :(
@iShipJapril Yeah I wonder how many people are gonna be shaking their April NEEDED to go pom-poms when Japril are hanging by a thread.
@iShipJapril In Shondaland.. you never, never know. Never. No one is safe.
@iShipJapril not at all caring about him. Really hope.
@iShipJapril they be, you know? I sincerely hope she doesn't come home still treating him like an afterthought and 'look at new bad ass me'
@iShipJapril Yeah I was saying.. think they'll "come together" in 24 along with everyone else, but things are not gonna be 100%. How could
@iShipJapril wasn't enough. Now he has to deal with a. his wife leaving and b. her coming back someone else. I feel for him.
@iShipJapril What sucks is Jackson didn't do any of this. None of it is his fault. He's tried and tried to just.. be there for her. And he
@iShipJapril sweet wife comes home a tough as nails soldier with a new look and personality? Oh shit.
@iShipJapril Still the same, still living the same life, been alone for a year with no one to talk to really, sad Panda bear.. and then his
@michelebolam it out for me. I can't be all RAH RAH April's a badass lil soldier girl when she's fucked her marriage over in the process.
@michelebolam I feel you.. I am having a hard time with my feelings towards her right now. And Japril to be honest. Hoping tonight smooths
@michelebolam Because I can't be a fangirl of a pussy. And if he doesn't stand up for himself, after what she did, that makes me a pussy.
@michelebolam I just need Jackson to have his balls back. Honestly. I don't care if they're fighting or what, just give him some balls.
@michelebolam I dunno, you just never know what's up in Shondaland. So much for Sarah's this brings them closer and solidifies them LOL!
@iShipJapril They just talked about basically how she's changed/people change in relationships/hard road for them because of it
@iShipJapril That was me saying that, not the Grey's podcast btw.. lol
@michelebolam I'm still pissed at her and won't be unpissed until she properly apologizes for it.
@iShipJapril supposed to deal with it with a smile? When she's not the April he fell in love with? Oooh this could get pretty damn angsty.
@iShipJapril Exactly. Them talking about people changing.. makes me think April is gonna be a lot different now. And then what? Is Jackson
@michelebolam what's going on anymore. lol
@michelebolam And now she comes home all hard and tough out of the military and he's just like.. what the fuck. Seriously. I don't even know
@michelebolam And the worst part..  had absolutely no concern in the world about him or his well-being or feelings or anything. Just nada.
@iShipJapril Oh he better. He most definitely better.
@michelebolam I think they'll come together in 24.. but doesn't mean all is well, know what I mean? 100% solid couple. Don't think so.
@michelebolam Which is why I am not entirely positive they will end  the season in a super happy place.
@iShipJapril relationships, etc. Basically does not sound like things are normal, roses, and sunshine.
@iShipJapril and that as much as they want April to recover from the baby, that's a hard road for a relationship too, people change in their
@iShipJapril It didn't explicitly say angst.. but in discussing 11x22 talks about Jackson not being able to wrap his head around her leaving
@michelebolam That's why she left. That's why she stayed away. That's why she did not want to leave.
@michelebolam Her real reason came out at Christmas.. because she can't handle the fact that they lost Samuel and it's not the 3 of them.
@michelebolam They don't even have a relationship at this point. A few calls every couple weeks doesn't cut it.  It needs major work.
@michelebolam be pretty angsty.
@michelebolam They have a lot of shit to work thru. Doubt it will be given the screen time is needs, but I expect whatever time we get to
@michelebolam supposed to be alright with it? Not only her being gone so long, but coming home someone else entirely? Hmmm.
@michelebolam She ran. She may have become a bad ass during her run, but she ran. From him, real life, reality. And now Jackson's just
@michelebolam them at all, or want to come home? I bet he does have trouble wrapping his head around that lol
@michelebolam How could anyone wrap their brain around their wife choosing to leave and stay away for so long, not seeming to  really miss
@michelebolam We'll see! Only a few hours to go to see where this is headed.
Shit is about to get real tonight. I just got a feeling.
Like I've been saying.. April went off and healed herself and became a badass soldier. But at WHAT cost?? Hmm! #Japril #GreysAnatomy
What happens when they change so much, one or the other isn't the same person they married? #GreysAnatomy
People do change in relationships.. but what happens when they change so much, the relationship no longer works? #GreysAnatomy
Ooooh according to Shondaland podcast.. angst is a comin' for Japril. Get ready for it my friends. #GreysAnatomy
@iShipJapril I should write this MFing show. lol
@iShipJapril They see all this bad stuff happening (perhaps with couples or what have you) and then in 24 she apologizes. Truly and sincere
@iShipJapril I'm not even here... and then that gives him perfect opportunity to lay it out there. Tragedy happens before April can respond
@iShipJapril April finally confronting him.. something like you barely touch me, you always have reasons to stay at the hospital, it's like
@iShipJapril at odds when this tragedy strikes would play out 100x better than if they're peachy keen.
@iShipJapril And if Jackson is still sore with her over it, that is his right. I hope he is, actually. Give Jesse some material. Plus Japril
@iShipJapril displeasure in what went down. And definitely not enough time before end of the season to resolve anything.
@iShipJapril If they've been just fine and dandy for the past 2 months, it'd be just random and out of nowhere for him to just now voice his
@iShipJapril come to a head in tonight's episode, and be resolved (as much as it can be) in 24.
@iShipJapril That's why I want the past 2 months to have been tense off screen, with only mentions of the hows/whys tonight. So that it can
@iShipJapril If they come back in 23 just happy-go-lucky with badass soldier April and Jackson, her purse carrier, I will probably flip.
@iShipJapril How they get there, how they write it, I won't be picky. I just want her to realize it was really messed up.
@iShipJapril Literally my bare minimum hope for tonight is April realizes and understands her actions were not fair to Jackson, at all.
@iShipJapril She just needs to be more considerate and careful with him and his feelings. Poor dude. This is a long-going issue.
I like my men with balls. Jackson Avery is teetering a very fine line. Give this man a point of view, damn! #GreysAnatomy @iJesseWilliams
@iShipJapril Just SHOW us that his feelings were expressed, heard, understood. That she realizes what she did to him was not alright.
@iShipJapril means she didn't hurt him intentionally I don't think. But intentions don't matter, actions matter.
@iShipJapril She's just relationship immature. Other than Matthew, Jackson is the only real one she's ever had. Doesn't excuse it, but it
@iShipJapril Same woman who didn't understand why he got upset when she'd compare him to car crashes and call having sex w him disgusting.
@iShipJapril April is very smart but relationship ignorant at times. He might have to literally spell it out for her lol.
@iShipJapril Also if the issue is ignored.. I can't get over my resentment of April for leaving like that. So fingers crossed really tight.
@michelebolam Still hoping Papa A pops up in the finale.
@iShipJapril If the issue is swept under the rug, it just goes to show how little they care about Japril, and specifically Jackson.
@iShipJapril every year?? Thinking it's fine? That alone is reason enough for J to lay down the law. We. Are. MARRIED. April.
@iShipJapril April thinks it was just fine what she did. How many free passes does the fandom have? Can get go away for 9 months at a time
@iShipJapril Other than the fact that I think Jackson got the major shaft.. if they don't deal with this issue as an issue, a problem..
@iShipJapril don't care enough about Jackson/April to write this fall out realistically.
@iShipJapril I am so curious how tonight is going to play out. Such potential. I hope the writers don't drop the ball simply because they
@iShipJapril glad I am not the only person who felt it came across that way :/
@iShipJapril YES. It was like a alternate universe where Japril were just BFF and she suffered this loss with someone else entirely. I am
@iShipJapril presents itself on TV.
@iShipJapril And this is a perfect set up for some drama/angst for them without including cheating or other people. Something that rarely
@iShipJapril understand the folks afraid of angst and wanting them to be happy happy. Happy happy is boring and don't ever get stories.
@iShipJapril Besides I am ready for angst. Angst is what makes couples great! Makes them who they are. Makes people root for them. I don't
@iShipJapril can't Jackson get some love, some opinions, anything? Wtf. lol
@iShipJapril her thru her loss, not like he suffered any loss himself. Really bizarre if you ask me. I mean even Jesse's gotta be like damn
@iShipJapril All about April. April's well-being, April's sadness, April's pain, April's loss. It's like he was just her friend helping
@michelebolam SpoilerTV said Jackson has become a background player on the show/with Japril. Sad. Jesse deserves some more material.
@michelebolam Can we get smart ass Jackson tonight? That'd be great!
@iShipJapril gonna feel. I don't like having bitterness towards her, ya know.
@iShipJapril April realizing she wronged him and apologizing will go a long way for me. If that doesn't happen I'm really not sure how I'm
@iShipJapril in these last two episodes or I'm calling major bullshit.
@iShipJapril Even SpoilerTV said Jackson's like a background player on the show and in the Japril relationship anymore. He better get a POV
@iShipJapril All boils down to the writers.. but after rewatching 22 a few different times, there's no way that this is gonna amount to nada
You're such a smart ass I love it. 
@iShipJapril not married. He lost a kid too, right? And then she bounced on him? Yeah, that's not cool at all. So there's a male perspective
@iShipJapril I told him there was a debate on if J should be mad or just be happy she's home and better. He said obviously those people are
@iShipJapril He said he would absolutely be mad. He probably could've let 3 months roll but almost a year? No way. He'd be pissed and hurt.
@iShipJapril I explained Japril's story to my husband this morning.. lol. And wanted his opinion, as a man, and as a husband.
Preach it baby. PREACH IT!!!  
Camilla is boss I swear. hahahaha 
Flawless 
My husband is so lucky he is the funniest person I've ever met.  
Elizabeth Olsen is so normal compared to her weird ass sisters.
How ever will you sleep at night? 
I want a beach vacay so badly I can hear the waves and smell the salty air.
Did you guys hear about that guy that lost his left arm and left leg??.... It's okay though, he's all right. #9yearoldhumor #IforrealLOLed
@mrush353 Good thing cocaine only stays in the system 3 days, whew!
Randomly started re-reading The Diary of Anne Frank last night. Forgot what a good book it is.
@newf93 Daisy swears up and down she never checked out that book so I don't even know.
@newf93 Thank you! I WISH I had them in black. They are so comfy. I have the worst lucky finding comfy heels because of my wide feet!
Seriously need a beach vacation.
Ya'll don't even KNOW how much I love @msdebbieallen!
@newf93 Gotta pay $30 for a book I never knew about. Smh
Maybe don't let 5yos check out books? Maybe??
When you get a note home from school saying you owe $30 for a library book your 5yo checked out and you've never seen. Da fuqity fuq.
Same. I can't help it! I am trying to resist it. It's just too soapy to not love it. 
Today is gonna be a good day. No cavities! Got a bonus! It's Thursday! Got my Barbie shoes on! 
@mrush353 Derek died two episodes ago lol she had another baby after he died.
@mrush353 Greys. Last week was a 2 hr special that covered a whole year.
@mrush353 a year is a long MFing time to bounce on your spouse after you both suffered a loss. I'd be absolutely pissed and devastated.
Words of wisdom from my gal pal.  
@mrush353 My point exactly. These folks gotta be super young/never in a serious relationship to think he should just be happy shes better.
@mrush353 Right! Why is this an argument JFC. Haha
@mrush353 goes to war as a doctor, not soldier btw.
@mrush353 3 months. Extends it for an entire year without caring what he thinks. Should he be mad?
@mrush353 and dies. Couple months later, wife decides to go to war agaibst husbands wishes for some excitement and happinesd, tells him only
@mrush353 he agreed with me! Blowing my mind people are seeing it differently. Newlywed couple gets preg, baby ends up having fatal disease
When you fangirl to your husband to get a male's perspective.
@michelebolam yup totally just fangirled to my husband to get his opinion lol
@michelebolam could have lived w the 3 months but to keep extending it I'd be super upset and anyone who says otherwise is obv not married.
@michelebolam I just explained Japrils story to my husband and asked him what he thought. He said uh well hell yeah I'd be mad. Probably
@michelebolam "find out what it means to be Avery's" could totally tie into this when they are able to work thru it.
@michelebolam the only thing that would prove is that Greys doesn't give a shit about Japril. However I've been thinking that Shonda's
@michelebolam I swear Michele if they come back just peachy keen fine I am gonna flip my shit lol
@michelebolam you are absolutely right. Being distant, not intimate.. after 2 months of that something has to explode.
@michelebolam this one I am majorly hoping for!
@michelebolam oh for sure. April has ALWAYS been oblivious to his feelings. I wouldn't be surprised if she's all shocked he's upset.
@michelebolam It surprised me typing it out how blatant her disregard/his unhappiness was.
@michelebolam yup or a mention of how  things have not been sunshine and rainbows since she came back.
@michelebolam did you read my Japril dialogue/commentary post? Makes what happened even more obvious.
@michelebolam same here, makes it 10x juicier than if they're hunky dory.
@michelebolam yeah I'm not expecting miracles but his feelings made aware and  acknowledged is a must. A MUST.
@michelebolam how any Japril fan could want that is beyond me.
@michelebolam if it turns out that April's just back and badass and Jackson is just happy she finally returned, I'm gonna rage.
Let the man have an opinion. Let him voice his feelings. If not it goes to show just how little they value him.  
Today is the day! Will Jackson finally get a POV? Or will he continue to be an afterthought? We shall see! #GreysAnatomy
Oh man Deacon and Rayna just broke my heart #Nashville
Life goes on but Jason will never be far from me... no she didn't <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #GH
This Liz/Jakeson story is so soapy it's great #GH
I think it would only be right for #FullerHouse to have the same theme song as #FullHouse, make it happen @JohnStamos @candacecbure
@1crightonly @UberFacts I believe it!
<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
I'm also dating the weekend a couple days a week.  
Them Olsen trolls came through?! Hooray!!!! 
Not even gonna fangirl.. nope.. not even gonna do it... must have strength. 
I'm not sure how I feel about Ed's pimping of the Bass anymore. :/
No shit, dumbass. Puberty doesn't make your lips increase 10x in volume. Smh.  
Guess who gets off early today. 
@PiperGT @CrystalSiegert @UrockButterBean Would shut a lot of people up, that's for sure!! hahaha
@mrush353 Like.. meet them.. and stuff. lol
@mrush353 My people never do shit with fans! UGH!
@UrockButterBean Wouldn't that be hilarious if he did know? lol
I can't give into soap shipping ever again. It hurts too bad. *rest in peace my Sonny and Brenda heart* 
Oh em gee, did Liason kiss today? Ugh! Look at me looking like a Liason fan. #GH
@iShipJapril Yes maam. Oooh I sure hope tomorrow doesn't let me down.
Why thank you. I had a fairly quiet morning obviously.. haha! 
@iShipJapril I can't be excited for bad ass April until this huge ass issue is dealt with. Then I'll be excited.
@iShipJapril Her lack of consideration for her husband, her selfishness. All needs addressing my friend.
@iShipJapril Yup yup yup. I agree with it all. Never said April wouldn't be more of a badass. It just doesn't excuse her treatment of J.
@iShipJapril Clearly they are not as passionate about Japril as we are, but I like that they pretty much agreed with how it played out.
@iShipJapril Well at least they mentioned how it was not cool to Jackson!
@MaryScarlett2u Hahaha I'm for real tho!
Jackson and April (Japril) Dialogue 11x22 with my commentary.. #GreysAnatomy

Read: 
@lorloLauren That crazy hooker showing up on you TL?
@Brigette912 not sure if the pic is funnier or you shading with an Obama pic.

Read more &amp; pls follow our IG :) 
@iJesseWilliams are you still filming? Going by your instagram pic..
Is Jesse still filming? Either that or his instagram pic is old.
Well I am just shocked I tell you. 
Keep that shit trimmed up fecal face. Lol  
Legit just typed up 11x22's dialogue. Smh. It's really worse every time.
Don't worry... we ALL do, Jenner kids. You're in good company.  
Adorable.  
LOL what a headline.  
"It's great for a nun, I guess, but you can't get any traction — you'll be slamming against the wall!" hahahahaha Michelle is too much.
Oh my.. how beautiful does my girlfriend @MRodOfficial look in this photo?? Love you Mich! 
If you go on Fox News, I automatically lose a bit of respect for you.
... I don't even know how this is possible. A small human is literally living and moving inside of you.   
They ARE pretty damn cute. And super tan.  
truth is known, Carly, Sam, and Sonny will all act like Jason is their personal property. I ain't mad at you.
FInally got to watch #GH yesterday and all I can say is.. go on with your bad self, Liz. Enjoy it while you can. Cuz you're right.. once the
This song is so cute it literally makes my ovaries hurt.  
Damn what a bummer Grooveshark shut down :/
@ShawnMarieH He just wanted me to know it wasn't going unnoticed. Woohoo! Shopping time.
@ShawnMarieH He's done it three times in the past two months. He fired one of the accountants and I've been taking up major slack for it
when my boss tells me he is putting extra $$ on my check because he appreciates me.. I ain't mad!
I have the urge to just crawl in bed and watch Sex and the City all day long.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui get thru the issues. Because if it's just brought up in 23, not sure how everything can be resolved in 24
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Exactly, yes. Just show us briefly that things have been tense/rocky/what have you and then we start trying to
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui resolving the issue.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui They needed that two month jump from when she returned-episode 23 to be rocky off screen so that they can start
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui up, apologizing, and then Jackson's be like swell! Thanks for the apology, all is well now. Would not fly with me
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I actually do hope things have been sore between them for a couple months when we come back in 23. April showing
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui too pissed by the time it rolls around lol *shakes fist*
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I am down for that. Totally down. It sucks I can't even fully enjoy the adorable of the hug in 22 because I am
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui is not too oblivious/self involved to realize she did the exact same damn thing. Except she had a spouse she left
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui At least Owen admitted to Amelia he ran. He runs. He runs to play G.I. Joe to forget real life. Hopefully she
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui takes a back seat. Hell he's on another bus entirely. It's time for HIM to get some love and support.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui This has been the season of April. April's feelings, April's well-being, April's emotions, April's pain. Jackson
@michelebolam I don't doubt she loves him. She just has a really shitty way of showing it. That's the whole issue.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui to the beach, deal with it together. ME. Let ME help you. But no. :(
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui It's always been like this. Like when they found out baby had OI, Jackson desperately wanted to be with her, go
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui passed since Samuel died. A year of which she chose to spend out of the country and away from Jackson.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui a year isn't healing, it's running away. TIME heals. So if April IS better it's because a year and a half has
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I realize she was in pain and devastated but you have to get it together and face your reality. Running away for
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I'm so glad you see it the same way I do. Newsflash: April isn't the first woman in history to lose her baby.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui happy she had fun playing soldier doctor for nearly a year.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui He'd be a dead beat husband for sure. But somehow when it's April doing it, he's just gotta accept it and be
@michelebolam and hurt on his behalf.
@michelebolam I'd just like for April to show me that she actually loves and cares and respects her husband because I am feeling very pissed
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui part of a year because he needed some excitement and happiness in his life... lol
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I wonder how people would  feel if it was Jackson that left her a few months after Samuel died for the better
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui another reason I call bullshit on her staying that long to "heal". She was having fun being G.I. April.
@michelebolam Something better trigger something. I don't want to spend all summer mad at her lol
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Wonder how long she would have stayed had they not been forced to leave :/
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui She must have been in the middle of her 3rd extension when they forced them out
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui stayed and had to deal with it alone, without any support from his wife. Like it's somehow his fault? Jesus.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui to have a child and supposed be spending Xmas the three of us! Don't you think he knows that?? He's the one that
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui When he told her it was Christmas and they were supposed to be together.. she gets all pissy we were SUPPOSED
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui does him wrong.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui attitude w/ him. She takes it for granted that no matter what he'll always be there to support her. Even if she
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui That is the heart of my issue. April takes Jackson for granted. That's why she is so inconsiderate and gets an
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Was it 6 or 9.. three extensions X 3 months. Guess it doesn't really matter. 9 months or a year, same shit lol
@ShawnMarieH Girl I love me some DB!!!
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui serious? She couldn't have found something closer to home? Ever heard of therapy? I mean.. no. That doesn't fly.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Some act like her leaving for a year to go to war was literally the only way she could have healed. Like are you
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui THIS could bode well for us. lol
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui So in 23 a tunnel collapsed.. April/Mer/Mag/Amy on scene for a husband who is trapped in the car. Wife got out.
Sneak peak for Grey's is out.. looks like a tunnel collapsed. April, Mer, Maggie, Amelia on the scene for a husband trapped in a car.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Maybe I will go take a gander at 23 and see if I can find anything.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui that he was home alone, miserable, for a year.. needs to be addressed. I want this to happen because I LOVE them
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui to be address. Her lack of consideration for Jackson's feeling and well-being needs to be addressed. The fact
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui That's why she NEEDS to be called out on her shit. So that they can work past it. Her tendency to run away needs
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui People assume I want them to break up and divorce because I say April needs to be called out on her shit. Hell NO
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui 
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui them to come back together. I am just sick of April's free passes. Girl needs to own her mistakes and apologize.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I feel things are going to be very tense between them when tragedy strikes, and then whatever happens will help
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui and how badly she hurt him in the process.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui make her realize how she basicallyjust threw away a year with her husband because she didn't want to face reality
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Think April/Jackson might both be working on a married couple where one of them dies or something happens to
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Yes, same here. I swear we are the same person lol.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui upset. He'll probably handle it more amicably that I would if I were him, but beggars can't be choosey.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Team Jackson. Homeboy needs more from his wife. Love, respect, consideration. He has every right and reason to be
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I will probably rage and start kicking shit. I am never Team Jackson/Team April but in this particular case I am
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui really upset that even if J does express his feelings, she gets defensive and starts defending her actions. Then
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I'd just really appreciate Jackson taking HIS balls back from her fanny pack and standing up for himself. I'd be
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui went back I was like holy shit, are you serious right now April? Gonna get attitude with him? Omg.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Her attitude on the phone got passed me the first watch I was still shocked she stayed away so long. But when I
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui demonstration of how little she considers him.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui That's what I said! You telling me that whole week she was without a phone? While he was worried sick? Another
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui How is anyone supposed to be okay with that? No one would be, I'm sorry. No one. Not even rockstar Jackson.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui 3 months away I would have understood. Jackson would have understood. Her keep refusing to come home for a year?
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Why should he have to treat her with kid-gloves when she just disregards him entirely? I don't understand that.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui feelings.. his well-being.. less important????
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui He had a hospital to run. And he had to this ALL alone because she chose to leave him for a year. Why are his
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Exactly! People seem to forget Jackson ALSO lost a child and then his wife bailed on him. He didn't get to run
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I guess April is the only person that matters in this marriage. Certainly seems to be her opinion at the moment.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui also read Jackson being mad at April will hinder the progress she made in her year away. What the actual F?
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I am a huge angst whore when it's not contrived and this is def not contrived. This angst needs to go down.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui wants you to come home is MORE than enough reason to have some major freaking conflict.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui is because it took place over one episode instead of an entire season. Leaving your husband for a YEAR knowing he
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui And if they ever needed conflict, THIS would be the time. I don't think people fully comprehend how long a year
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui doctors during the catastrophe? No personal conflict going on? I don't buy that for a minute.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui not to mention.. IF things come back and everything is just fine.. what story do they have for 23/24? Background
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui His face when he was looking at her + his eyes during the hug told me that this the calm before the storm.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui except he's relieved she's not dead in a ditch and happy to see her face after 12 months but is incredibly hurt.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Exactly. That's how Grey's like to do it. Oh see how cute Japril are? He's just so excited she's home...
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Doctors having to put their emotions aside gives me great hope that this will be addressed the way I need it to
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui that. A complete 180 from that adorable hug in 22. That's how Shonda likes to roll.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I wouldn't be surprised if things are worse than even I think. Like him staying at the hospital or something like
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui bad for Japril. So two months is too long for him to be hurt and sour but a year away is apparently fine lol
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui And some have said well two months have passed since she came home, he can't still be mad at her that would be so
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui shocked if they come back in 23 all normal and happy and everything is hunky freakin dory. Shocked.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui They had her extend *three* times, disregard Jackson's feelings on the matter, for a reason. I will be absolutely
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui If this was JUST about putting an end to April's grief, she would have came home at 3 months like she said.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I believe they did this story for a reason. 22 clearly showed Jackson as the one getting the great big shaft.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui Me either! Not at all. Cuz eventually it will explode and be uglier than we ever wanted.
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril call it HAS to happen for them to get there.
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril I think by the end of the finale, they will be in a better place. But this fight/discussion whatever you want to
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui her actions were totally fine. And two.. they head down the Calzona sweep it under the rug road.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui If Jackson just bottles up his feelings and doesn't tell her how she made him feel, one.. that makes April think
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui for a year against his wishes I'd fully expect him to be mad and a fight to go down.
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui I'd like to know of a marriage where they never fight lol I fight w my husband. It's normal. If I left my husband
@iShipJapril she's in April's world where only her pain and feelings matter or even exist.
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril A fight is necessary IMO. This is a marriage. Fights are inevitable and if there was ever a good reason to have 1
@iShipJapril seen her in a year and obv missed her. Reality will set in quick tho. At least it SHOULD.
@iShipJapril total fakeout IMO. Wanted April and viewers to think all was okay. He spent the past week thinking she was dead. Plus he hadnt
@iShipJapril hella hurt man. Like.. beyond hurt.
@iShipJapril I was shocked too. Also how little it seemed to bother her to be away from him for a YEAR. I mean damn. If I was J I'd be
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui HM said she's only in 23 so I dunno
@iShipJapril Very OOC. And I can't with people saying she NEEDED to. No. Three months I could have rationalized. A year was just wrong.
@iShipJapril what she wants?? Hmm
@iShipJapril had they not forced her out.. would he have been wifeless another year?? Would he have had to just be okay with it because its
@iShipJapril otherwise she thinks it's okay to take off for a year everytime she needs excitement and happiness in her life :(
@iShipJapril I'm not expecting miracles but I fully expect Jackson to voice his feelings. April needs to know what she did was not okay.
@iShipJapril that's how it came across in her words, actions, and tone.
@iShipJapril to me it came across like if she couldn't have the family, just Jackson wasn't good enough.
@iShipJapril yup.. and I wonder if they had her tell J that on purpose. "They made us leave.."
@iShipJapril Very sour taste. :( He was trying so hard to be understanding but there's only so much you can take.
@iShipJapril 1st watch. 2nd watch I was like really April??? Lol
@iShipJapril And it was obvious he had been on her about coming home and she'd always have an excuse to stay. Her attitude I missed during
@iShipJapril not only was it me me me but  also screw your thoughts and feelings, bye
@iShipJapril how anyone can say they weren't selfish I have no idea. They were entirely 100% selfish.
@iShipJapril her whole attitude IMO was damn Jackson why can't you understand this is what I want??
@iShipJapril spend xmas the 3 of us and everytime I think of that... to me a clear CLEAR indication that she WAS running.
@iShipJapril actually, you weren't drafted. We are supposed to be.. she cuts him off. We were supposed to have a child, we were supposed to
@iShipJapril says really? You've extended 3 times now does that make you colonel? She says I wish I could be there w you. He says you could
@iShipJapril she's coming home. Dhe has to go. Christmas call you can tell he has voiced his frustrations before, she saud she "tried" he
@iShipJapril him she's staying. Jackson doesn't understand wants to know if they're gonna discuss it or she just made the choice. Asks when
@iShipJapril rude to him during both calls. Abrasive anyway. 1st call she was irritated he hadn't been picking up cuz he was working. Tells
@iShipJapril I rewatched the episode and feel he has even more reason to be upset. It was clear he wanted her home and she was borderline
Running.
"We were supposed to be.." "We were supposed to have a child, we were supposed to spend Xmas the 3 of us and everytime I think about that.."
Holy yes @msdebbieallen as Executive Producer and Director of Grey's!
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui If not then April thinks it's a-okay to just bounce whenever she needs excitement and happiness.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui someone who lets their spouse do whatever they want regardless of it it hurts him, them, and their marriage
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui Just give Jackson a POV and some balls. That's all I ask. There's a fine line between rock star husband and
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui going to remind them all what's important, they must all forget.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui it's probably going to be everyone. Amelia/Mer. Japril. Jolex. Whoever else if this event is
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui if Japril are hunky dory what emotions are they putting aside??
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui exactly. That's not just referring to Mer/Amelia "drs must put their emotions aside when disaster strikes"
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui plus they gotta have everyone with tension and at odds for this event to bring them back together
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui sick of giving her free passes. Not even sorry.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui I'm not expecting miracle writing. As long as Jackson's feelings are known and April is aware she fucked up.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui thinking since it carries over to next week, disaster isn't until mid episode
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui she stood up for him once last season and for her relationship w Catherine this season
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui can't just leave for a year and expect to jump back in to how things were ya know
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui and also things being weird/not normal between them out of sync and April being like wtf.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui oh you mean that ONE time lol after she kneed him in the balls herself
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui I don't forsee blow up like mad yelling but unleashing his feelings he's bottled up in a very emotional manner
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui not only her leaving but her attitude about it, like damn Jackson why can't you understand this is what I want.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui unless the writers truly want Jackson to be spineless abd ball-less. I certainly do not.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui Seriously upon rewatch I'm not sure how anyone can think things are gonna be solid between them this week.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui this is 100x worse than comparing him to car crashes too.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui you'd think she'd learn by now that he has feelings. Jesus April you're killing me smalls!
@michelebolam also noted again they made her leave. :/
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam I agree on 2nd watch she wasn't very nice to him.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui she completely didn't consider him AT all <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui I'm saying I would be beyond pissed/hurt. I mean I think any spouse in that situation would be.
@michelebolam She was a real jerk about things. So if one tour is three mos and she extended 3 times.. that makes a year.
@michelebolam Him wanting her home was not news to her. "I know.. I'm sorry, I tried.." "Really??" Yup. Shits bout to hit da fan.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui Honestly if I was Jackson.. I'd be beyond pissed. Not just hurt. But angry.
@michelebolam "You've extended this thing 3 times already.. what does that make you, Colonel now?"
@michelebolam I am more than expecting some angst in 23 now. How you can watch that as a Japril fan and not expect it I dunno.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui she'd been away from her husband for a year.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui I am sitting here kinda shocked at how abrasive and unfeeling she was about the whole thing. You'd never guess
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui She was a lot more direct and inconsiderate during the Christmas call than I remembered :(
@michelebolam She said I know, I wish I could be there with you and he's all.. you could, actually. You weren't drafted.
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam working?? Like let me just be your doormat and available to YOU when YOU want. JFC.
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam And then her "Why haven't you been answering my calls?" During the first phone call and he's all um, I've been
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam On 2nd watch, yes she wasn't very nice about anything. She was downright rude during Christmas.
@michelebolam before things are not gonna be sunshine and rainbows.
@michelebolam home if she wanted to, she wasn't drafted. She says I wish I could be there with you and he says "Really." More convinced than
@michelebolam 2nd call on Christmas, you can tell he is pissed. She did extend 3 times. Says they are supposed to be together. She could be
@michelebolam doesn't understand. Does she want to talk about this or did she just make the decision? When is she coming home? She has to go
@michelebolam I just forced myself to rewatch it again and yup.. April was most def selfish. First call with Jackson.. he's tells her he
@michelebolam Every time I rewatch 22 I just get so angry! This surely cannot be healthy #fangirlproblems
@SonnyandBrenda I am confused on how anyone can draw that parallel. There's absolutely nothing similar
What the hell is Katy Perry smoking? Is she trying to be unattractive? For the love  
Love going to lunch with my BFF to Olive Garden. Without fail we always have to argue over who gets to toss the salad in front of the waiter
I need an outsider's perspective on a fangirl dilemma. Requirements are you must also be a fangirl (of anything) and not a dick. Anyone?
I can't even rewatch 11x22 it just makes me angry. I don't like being angry at characters I like. Ugh.
Many do unfortunately. 
Where is the lie tho. 
That time my boss tagged me on Facebook.. "diving into the fuzzy taco buffet"..
Some Fuzzy's Tacos for #CindoDeMayo sounds bomb.
I for realz just laughed out loud. Poor Jesse with his old ass. 
Lmao like those results couldn't have been just.. entered. No way Who? beat Stefan and Mike!  
@AnnabelRogue I like Liz, always have. But I am realistic. I know how this is gonna go for her. I see how she's wrong, but I understand.
@1crightonly everyone else in this town has pulled.
@1crightonly Liz is never the winner. And really.. I get where she's coming from. It's not right, but I get it. And it's no worse than what
@AnnabelRogue Dude Liz fans and Liz haters go hard.
Ahhh soap fans are nucking futs, I don't know how I forgot this 20 year fact of my life.
@djp1177 It's fun to watch GH no strings attached, different experience for me. I just take it as it is. All these fuckers are messed up.
@djp1177 Everytime she's on screen tho Ben's all "damn that's my GURL right there, mm mm mm." just to piss me off. Smh.
@djp1177 I have developed a love/hate relationship with Carly opposed to just hate/hate/hate.
Fuck it, I say GET YO MAN Liz. We all know she's gonna be the one getting the shaft in the end. #GH
I gotta say I love how Laura Wright is so into the show and supportive of her cast mates.
This was a wild film. 
I'm with this.  
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv You'd think they'd cast Stephanie a boyfriend or something. Steph does like em young lol
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv And they are both super young.. 22 and 25. Where they gonna fit in?
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I don't think either actor they cast as the newbies is that attractive either :/
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv recurring characters. Two of them (the guys I said) have been announced. Nada on third.
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv TV Line said something along the lines of Grey's ending this season with 3 new possibly
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Although holy crap I am shocked Amelia is only 33. I would've assumed 40.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Said Derek has 3 older sisters and one younger, Amelia on that link.
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv So she's NOT the third recurring character.. Papa A dream still lives on!
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv I think patient i.e. Mandy Moore is likely.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv So Amelia is the only one younger than Derek, no way Heather can be a sibling.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Well she should! Ellen is 45. hahaha
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Amelia looks WAY older than 33 :/ not to be mean. lol
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Damn Caterina is only 33?! She looks much older.. no offense to her.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Aren't Amelia and Derek twins? Did I just make that up.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv was the youngest. Also think it'd be kinda random to just bring in another Derek sister
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv True but his sisters were all much older than Heather. She is 33 and Neve is 41, she
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv 4 sisters.. Amelia, Kathleen, Liz and Nancy. All previously cast.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I want to say he has 3 sisters but maybe I am wrong and it's 4.
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv all his sisters cast before anyway? I know 3 of them were.
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv Maybe? Kinda late for her to show up since he died a year ago in Grey's time. Weren't
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Joe Adler and Giacomo Gianniotti are the two new doctors.
@TurnTheBeatUp Ah well. I'm here for it. Do you, Liz.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Or patient I suppose. Could be a two episode arc for her.
@WubsNet it has to otherwise why would Jakeson be torn. If he can't remember Sam and doesn't have a current connection with her, falls flat
Damn I'm trying to work and ya'll are distracting me.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv starting makes sense with the other two.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Actually being a bigger name.. maybe she'll be an intern too. A new group of interns
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Ooh wonder who she will be. A patient probably.
@WubsNet I'm surprised they haven't tried to build the Jasam connection more than they have.
@TurnTheBeatUp And? She fits right in with the other manipulative wrong-doers in PC. I ain't mad.
Naw.. he'll be all about Liz.  
It ain't right, but it's Port Charles. Child's play in the grand scheme of things. #GH
I can't with people acting like Liz is some horrible monster considering the shit ERRBODY in that town has pulled. #GH
This motherchucker lol  
I guess they do age in the after life, eh Court? #GH
@SonnyandBrenda That Magic Mike routine had me cringing all day.
Someone tell me if Liz and Jake had a scene pleeeeease #GH
Cracking up. I can't hate her for it, but I know she's gonna get the shit end of the stick in the end.  
Did Liz and Jakeson have a scene? Deets? #GH
@SonnyandBrenda Remember back in the day it was PACKED with extras. Looked like a legit benefit.
True words. Plus the 20 person audience. How much $$ they expecting to raise with 20 people?  
Yes, please. 
Stupid writing. He was just telling her not to yesterday. Wtf. She was all disgusted with him for keeping it secret. 
So sad Grey's is done filming until September! No more BTS pics. Boo!!! Poor Paddy D couldn't handle this gruesome 4 month break.
1997 badass lil Lizzie is back. Too bad her ass is gonna be thrown under the bus when all is said and done. #GH
It really makes me giggle how much they disregard Scum. Like are they even together..?? #GH
LMAO. 
@djp1177 Mmhmm.. when everyone finds out, Liz's ass is grass. Buh bye Jakeson.. again. If she told the truth now she'd have a better shot
@djp1177 Oh fuck. I knew it.
@djp1177 oh lawd.. what's the chick sayin
@djp1177 She should be pretty comfy there by now
@newf93 @djp1177 The only time Steve acted alive was in scenes with Vanessa.
@djp1177 How would everyone.. Sam, Carly, etc.. feel about that from super all-knowing great Jason
@djp1177 I think the better story is Liz telling Jake in private and him deciding to keep it a secret for his own reasons.
@newf93 @djp1177 Well no one is as wooden as Steve Burton so we're already steps ahead lol
@djp1177 Unless he gets his memories back tho.. it's not like knowing he's married to Sam is going to mean he suddenly loves her.
@djp1177 Smh. I hope it doesn't go the way I suspect it will. I was really liking Liz and Jake. Boo.
Honestly can't believe they brought Courtney back and expect everyone to believe the fans voted for her. Come on. #GH
LOVED it.  
They're totally gonna fuck Elizabeth in this Jason reveal aren't they. Same shit, different decade. #GH
For fucks sake Liz just tell everyone! 
@djp1177 Well you know I disagree ;) he's the only reason I watch GH.
@djp1177 Yes he does. He was amazing as Billy on Y&amp;R. The writing for Jakeson is killing me smalls.
Ughhhh I cannot take the prolonging of Jake=Jason anymore!!!! #GH
I dig a classy side boob.
@ijessewilliams Thank you for shaving. It was causing me a lot of unnecessary heartache.
Really considering taking this photo of @camilluddington to my hair stylist this weekend and chopping my hurr off. 
Your hair is adorable!!! Going to have to go cut mine now. 
3/3 come back, and even then.. it's not like Jason didn't love Liz too. Add that to Jake loving Liz and.... just sayin #GH
2/3 nothing to do with his old life/previous girlfriend. Saying he will drop Liz and go to Sam is bogus. Unless his memories of Jason #GH
1/2 Just because Jake finds out he is Jason doesn't mean he will have Jason's memories. Jason M didn't have Jason Qs memories and wanted #GH
Ryan is a good guy 
@iShipJapril He was indeed! He is now Jason on GH!
How cute is this guy? #BillyMiller #JakeDoe #JasonMorgan #GH 
@ShawnMarieH She's the only one in her family with any class at all.
@iJesseWilliams I dig that hoodie. Where did you get it
Aaand I just remembered I forgot to put money their lunch accounts so.. cool mom points revoked.
Picking up a trampoline tonight for the kids. It's a surprise. I'm expecting to get some cool mom points for this.
@newf93 I love that song Patrick and Emma sang. Emma is seriously the cutest.
@newf93 bubblegumprincess@hotmail.com lol
My forever lover. 
Royalty? Seriously.  
There's no way she was voted. They probably had her slated to return and then pretended to give the fans a say in it 
This is great. 
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv the close up of Jackson's eyes.. those eyes got to me.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv 23 when things are the opposite of good. Plus April's smiley face was countered with
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Agreed. They ended at the hug so that fans think all is well. Only to be surprised in
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv wants to protect her/not hurt her. But she will push and push until he finally explodes
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv I could see Jackson avoiding her instead of unleashing his emotions because he always
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv I sure hope we are right because just thinking about it gets me all in my emotions
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv this big emotional talk right before tragedy strikes, leaving it hanging.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv moment. Or has been avoiding her. And in 23 April finally confronts him and they have
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Guess it depends. They could come back and Jackson's not even speaking to her at the
@newf93 @wmzraz I am really looking forward to Carly finding out it's Jason. Laura is gonna knock that out.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Poor Little Jackson ain't getting no action, dang.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Gonna be real interesting if they haven't been intimate since she's been back.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Can we get some banging during Wavery wedding? That'd be sweet lol
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv life and bonds them together." Certainly sounds like it could play out the way we want
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv tragedy strikes" followed by "a tragic event reminds the doctors what is important in
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Okay, good to know I am not reaching there. "Doctors must put aside their emotions when
@wmzraz @newf93 Literally no one means more to Carly than Jason lol
@wmzraz @newf93 Imagine when Carly finds out he is Jason? Chills girl. Chills.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv passed now and Jackson still ain't getting no love, recognition, consideration, nada.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv it when they lost the baby, poor April was devastated. But a year-year and half has
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Always the understanding one, always the one that gets the raw end of the deal. I got
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Just give the man his balls back from April's camo fanny pack and we're good lol
@wmzraz @newf93 loyal to just anyone and they want the Jarly bond to remain front and center, but Billy and Laura sell that shit.
@wmzraz @newf93 They're adorable together. I love their friendship. Sure, it's totally contrived because Carly is never that nice and
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv of drama/angst in 23 and then resolution (at least semi) in 24.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv What really gives me hope is the PRs for 23 and 24. It totally plays along the lines
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv He's basically become April's doormat with no POV this season and I need this fixed.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv I am a Japril fan but I am also a Jackson fan and I don't like how they write for him.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv final 2 episodes so fingers crossed.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv But that's what their story in 22 was about. So I have hopes. They amp the drama in the
Surely something else happens to make her not say anything right away.. I hope. #GH
I don't think Liz keeps the Jakeson secret to have him to herself. She was disgusted that Nik kept it a secret from Sam and Danny. #GH
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv point of view and April realizes how selfish her actions have been.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv be satisfied. That's really my main hope/wish before the season ends. Jackson gets a
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv As long as Jackson gets a point of view and isn't just quiet Mr. Understanding I will
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv He did the bathroom sex didn't he?
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv McKidd directed 23.. that makes me excited too!
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv some love, attention, and consideration in return.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv He's only human tho, and can only be superstar husband for so long without needing
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv He wrote the Japril scenes in 16.. car sex. So he's cool. We like him.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv April takes it for granted.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Baby stuff just showed how awesome/understanding/supportive Jackson is. 22 showed that
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv G.I. Mike Minute.. lol. Probably what the ladies call him too :/
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv I know it. Please fix this writers before I rage!!!
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv all good in the hood.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv the shaft. Ignoring her call was a big indicator to me that things are not gonna be
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv I actually do think that was their intentions in 22. To show that Jackson is getting
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv and your grief? Really? Are you fucking serious? While I sat here, miserable and alone
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv More like you left me here alone for a year only to confide in this man about OUR CHILD
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv But since I know April and love her, I am giving her the benefit of the doubt/writing
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv screen. If Jackson was my brother, I'd be talking shit about his wife all day long.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv Needs to be rectified tho.. because shitting writing or not, it's what is reflected on
Also OMG Liz's reaction to Jake = Jason was on point. He was remembering our son. I totally cried like a bitch. Not gonna lie. #GH
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv shit about Jackson's feelings and I hope it was just shitty writing. lol
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv The baby story really did some damage for me. It came across that April didn't give a
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv balls talk about some angst. They don't need cheating, that'd be more than enough.
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv And imagine April bonding/confiding in this soldier while Jackson was home alone. Holy
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv him would go a long long way for me.
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv Also April showing him/telling him how much he means to her and how much she appreciate
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv to see Jackson's emotions and Jesse bring it. So excited.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @autismteach11 @LuvWivLuv I would think all Japril fans would feel that would be a total cop out. I am so excited
Also I hate Carly with the fire of a thousand burning suns but love her with Jake. WTH is Billy doing to me! #GH
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv everything is just peachy keen between them and all is well thru the finale. Um no. lol
@iShipJapril @autismteach11 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv Yup yup. There's no other way for it to go. Can you imagine Thursday's episode
Secondly.. I used to hate Liason with Steve. And now I'm totally into them with Billy. What the hell! My fangirl mind is so confused. #GH
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Japril with what happened in 22 so the writers better not drop it.
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I'm a fan that LOVES some good angst, and there's oodles of it for
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv hate season 11.
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv If they are just background and everything is hunky dory, I officially
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Some angst in 23 will go a long way for me though.
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv It was just a shitty season all together. My least fave
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv That doesn't explain the first 5 episodes of the season :/
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv do. She can literally pull anything out of her ass lol
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv absence will always hang in the back of my mind. What's Shonda gonna
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I think they will end the season on good terms. But that year long
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv There's no way they will end the season not together. They are married
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Still holding out hope that Papa A shows up tho. Fingers crossed!!!
@autismteach11 @ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Oh I'm talking about NEXT season! Hahaha the drama never ends!
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv play ignorant or act all shocked he'd be upset with her.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Which he should be so I am glad she realizes that. I was hoping/am hoping she doesn't
First of all, Billy Miller is the greatest recast of all time, ever. Ever. Ever. Ain't nobody missing you Steve. #GH
@ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Jackson was home alone would def create some dramz.
@ThandiMbulaheni @michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I agree. There was no cheating. But April bonding with a soldier while
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv woman who knew she did her husband wrong and expecting him to be mad.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I think April's face/apprehension made them think she cheated. Where I just saw a
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Shonda won't let the opportunity to bring a surprise from that year into the fold.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Just remember who writes this show girl.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Having a year long absence unaccounted for on screen is scary in Shondaland.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv Seattle next season who had a thing for her just to cause some drama.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv No cheating but I wouldn't put it past Shonda to bring a soldier from April's trip to
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv If I recall correctly I believe it was hospital beds/hospital room
Can I please talk about my Jakeson feelings #GH
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv If Mama A gets hurt maybe she and Richard get married in her hospital room
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Those two little boy interns don't cut it. We need MEN MEN. Like Papa A. lol
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Hadn't heard anything about HM. We need more men esp now that Derek is gone
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv we thought she was in 23 not 22 but she was in 22. Could be she's in 22, 23, and 24
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv that would be dynamite!
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv 2 are those new interns.. whos the third?
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv plus tv line said by the end of the season there would be 3 new recurring characters.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv for sure. Still think there were too many daddy mentions to not amount to anything
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv hearing Catherine is tying the knot?
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv still waiting for them to find out what it means to be Averys like Shonda said.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Catherine's all DA FUQ? lol
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Papa A! Papa A! Showing up at Wavery wedding would be AWESOMENESS
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv thats what the PR says :)
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv perfect time to explore Jacksons abandonment issues lol
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv there's still the wedding in 24 btw Wavery I would guess. Maybe Papa A shows up.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv reminded of whats important in life.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv maybe husband/wife patients where one doesn't make it and the other is distraught
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv person or did it intentionally. But all the same, it sucks.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv or she took it for granted he'd wait for as long as she wanted. Not saying she's a bad
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv I'm not sold that either gets hurt tho. Think just the tragedy around them is a wake up
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv bad life sucks without her
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv needs a reminder of how bad life would suck minus Jackson. Jackson knows first hand how
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv that would actually piss me off. Jackson needs the attention okay! Lol
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv yeah he had lots of blood to wipe off for sure
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv other way around
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Yeah I don't like the idea of April getting hurt, Jackson freaking out. Would prefer
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv but really could just be blood from patients
@iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv I'd prefer Jackson getting injured opposed to April at this point in their story.
@ouafaealaoui @michelebolam @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv should be good stuff!!!
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv yeah but there's a BTS of SD with her scrubs covered in blood too?? Hmmmm
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv bring everyone together
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv whatever it is gotta be brutal. Sarah and Jesse both covered in blood and its enough to
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv why they're all outside in OR scrubs is a big ??
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv bridge collapsed but due to.. ? Earthquake makes sense but they did that already.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv I'm glad they didn't go with living OI baby. They would have botched it
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv esp if they are on rocky terms, operating together during a catastrophe would be <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv they already did that this season but could be
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv for very long
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv yeah lots of craziness going on outside the hospital. Don't think the girls are on site
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv the baby story was a joke. Good idea, poor execution
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Amelia got TOO damn much screentime.
@michelebolam @iShipJapril @ouafaealaoui @LuvWivLuv Japril was so choppy.. start, stop, start, stop. No follow thru.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv if it's angsty.. god willing.. it will make up for a bit.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv the WORST.
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv freaking course lol
@michelebolam @ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv sucks they waited til the very end of the season to give Japril anything juicy. Of
@ouafaealaoui @iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam no way is it series finale.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam things are rocky in 23.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam I really think 24 reminding everyine what's important and bringing them together is a good indicator
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam well my year hasn't been so fun April. Lol
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam imagine she comes home going on and on about how awesome her travels were. J is just like... really.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam will only last for so long.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam which was probably the writers intentions. He spent the past week thinking she could be dead. Relief
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam stand her actions weren't okay :(
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam Yup especially for as long as she did. I really want her to see how badly she hurt him and to under
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam the shot of Jackson's eyes during the hug.. it makes me think.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam strong person to not be hurt and resentful and I think Jackson is tapped out.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv @michelebolam When you pretend everything is okay when it's not you end up like Calzona. It'd take an incredibly
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv I will feel robbed if there's no angst. Legit robbed
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv that's the thing it seems she never runs to him. They were each others support system and then.. not.
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv I really hope she realizes it and doesn't try to excuse it or get defensive
@iShipJapril @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv I feel you.They are two separate issues entirely. It shouldn't be April can be a badass OR a good wife
Patrick and Emma &lt;3 #GH
Omg it's Courtney hahaha guess they do age in the afterlife. #GH
RC needs to STOP with these kid love triangles. Wtf? Where are their parents man #GH

There's like 20 people at the Nurse's Ball. Remember when it used to look like a real event #GH
@Nicole80017 what is with these women. It's like hey let's have a contest who can look the most ridiculous
I think Beyoncé looks ridiculous. Smh
I love you??? Oh jeez. No Amber. #TeenMomOG
Lmao Farrah and this toolbag. She's so desperate. #TeenMomOG
Crying during @CatelynnLowell and grandma's scene too. I love you Cate! Cutest mommy #TeenMomOG
Farrah has the worst cry face in history. Her unfortunate plastic surgery enhances the awfulness. #TeenMomOG
Farrah JFC this brainless twit. Ugh she makes me rage #TeenMomOG
.@MTV: @threelilbirdsss @CatelynnLowell @TylerBaltierra Right?! #TeenMomOG
I can't with Amber and her twitter boyfriend. #TeenMomOG
Okay now I'm bawling @CatelynnLowell and @TylerBaltierra are the cutest parents ever. #TeenMomOG
Dude Ryan and Farrah would make the biggest douchebag cunty couple of all time. Let's make it happen #TeenMomOG
Why does Farrah have to be such a freaking bitch all the time?! #TeenMomOG
Hey look at Robert Pattinson out with his girlfriend at a public event. Wonder if he's still getting use to that? K Stew said hell nah.
This Ryan Gosling Won't Eat His Cereal meme is too damn funny.
@djp1177 Hilarious right. All those Courtney fans dying for her return. Lol come on man.
GROSS.  
@ShawnMarieH She always looks on point
@ShawnMarieH She needs to cover that nastiness up.
Now this is pretty.  
They make me ill.  
I'm sayin!!  
@michelebolam @1crightonly yeah lots of couples get screwed by real life comings and goings. S&amp;B were my OG OTP and look what happened.
April/Ben scene in finale.  
@1crightonly @michelebolam they were brutal. Soap fans are dirty man.
@1crightonly @michelebolam Kim said she's never coming back so they either need to recast or kill Robin. There's no way she'd leave her kid
@1crightonly @michelebolam really? I guess I was overwhelmed with all the Sabrina hate from Scrubs fans to notice
@michelebolam @1crightonly they turned her into a dead beat mom, put saving the world over Emma. Really sad :(
@1crightonly a fighting chance
@1crightonly I dunno tho they're playing up Liason big time to just drop it for Jasam.. if Jake never remembers being Jason, Liz might have
@1crightonly @michelebolam Sabrina actually has fans with Michael, crazy. I can take or leave either
@michelebolam @1crightonly @JaprilARG lord save us from ever having to see it again lol
@1crightonly @JaprilARG he really does look like Jafar from Aladdin.
@1crightonly @JaprilARG April better hope Jackson never hurts his hand cuz Jesse would be on that beard like white on rice.
@1crightonly @JaprilARG holy shit now I'm traumatized by Lumberjackson
@ShawnMarieH debating going to see it this week
@ShawnMarieH hey how was The Age of Adeline?
@ShawnMarieH da fuq is that?
This will always break my heart a little. 
Whatever helps you sleep at night homie  
Is it certain Liz keeps Jake=Jason a secret?? #GH
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Amen sister! Amen!
He knows.  
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril opposed to some crazy make up sex scene. Just throwing that out there.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I'd also like to add that after Jackson lays out his feelings and April apologizes I would not be
Clearly.. this is fate.
Just entered a new home buyer into the system named Averie Jackson. :D
That shit had to be rigged.  
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril But just leaving him for a year is a-okay! Long as she kept those legs closed. :P
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Oh yeah people jumping off ledges when they thought she was cheating on Jackson. Hahaha
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Seriously? HAHAHAHAHA that is funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shonda do like to recycle tho.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril That's the only way those two situations are ANYTHING alike.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Yeah. Call me when Callie gets her leg cut off at the same time you gets your cut off Arizona.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril see, Arizona knows whats up!" Umm.. she cheated on her spouse and is now divorced. No thanks.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Yeah and Jackson's supposed to take marital advice from ARIZONA lol and all the Japril fans like "yah!
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Yup :( Jackson tried everything he could, did everything he could but it wasn't enough.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril was. Sweeping it under the rug and acting like things are fine gets you to where Calzona is.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Which is forgivable HOWEVER he needs to give her the what-for and she needs to realize how wrong it
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Well that would require April giving any shits at all about what Jackson feels/thinks soo... no. lol
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril treating her like some delicate flower. Her words.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Out in the field, excitement, adrenaline, different atmosphere, different surroundings. No husband
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril People cracking me up acting like that is the ONLY way for her to get better. lol say what?
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril She wanted to get away from her reality. The farther away the better.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Running.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril He doesn't HAVE to be okay with that!!!
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril her. It's about April disregarding Jackson entirely for so long without a care in the world!
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Nor should he have to be. This isn't about Jackson "loving all of her" or getting her or understanding
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril not to even mention.. extending that trip another 6-9 months. No one.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril No one is going to be okay with their spouse choosing to leave them for 3 months on a day's notice
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril April comes first :( for him AND for her.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril reality check. He deserves better than that. NOT HER (4 u people spying) but that treatment.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril She takes Jackson for granted. She assumes he'll always be there no matter what. She really needs a
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril It seriously makes me want to cry. Not even playin.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Not saying they won't have jobs, but others have taken over taking charge of the ER.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril something right.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril department even functioning with Owen AND April gone?? Could they have been replaced? That would be
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril left behind to be G.I. April. The reality that she hurt her husband. Also.. how the hell is the trauma
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Yep. I'm glad she's better and lookin' all hot.. but now she's gotta face reality. The reality she
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril show, if more people would see how messed up it was.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I do wonder had this happened over a season long (Sarah D being absent for a season) instead of a 2 hr
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril They've pretty much been apart as much as they've been together the duration of their marriage.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Well now she's all jacked up on G.I. Jane adventures. But real life awaits you, April.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril And heal together, with her husband, the father of the baby, the man that also lost his son.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril to be gravy when YOU decide it's time to come back and YOU decide it's time to act married again.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril And you can't leave your marriage for that long knowing your husband wants you back and expect things
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril like that during the hardest time in his life plus being someone whose spouse ran out on them before
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Also what we were saying.. would not be surprised if Mama A is sore with her too. Leaving her baby boy
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I want to give Jackson just a big ol' hug. Poor dude.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril the man I love and was newly married to for the better part of a year.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I never would've left. There's a little thing called therapy I would've tried to heal before leaving
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I know right :*-( she was just so unfair to him. I don't know how everyone can't see that.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril 3 months I could've understood. But the fact that she kept extending/no plans of returning.. no.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Exactly my point. It was all about her, nothing to do with him, and that's not how marriage works.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I'd never leave little Jackson's side if I was his wife.. or Big Jackson. lol
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I mean serious question tho.. who leaves Jackson Avery and that body behind for that long on purpose
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril kept extending it.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Right, but she just didn't care what her absence was doing to him. Or affecting him. Which is why she
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Jackson probably didn't realize space meant two continents and a couple oceans for a year lol
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril And I'm not sure which one is worse :/
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I don't think she intentionally wanted to get away from Jackson. She just didn't consider him at all
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Oooh I am so pumped for Thursday. I am such an angst whore, I need GA to bring that shit!!!
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril their child all by himself.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril It was diff than Meredith. Meredith didn't leave her partner in life behind to deal with the loss of
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril 2018
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril  Jackson better be happy they got bombed or he would've been wifeless until the 4th of July lol
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril And she said as much to Jackson. Boy.. his feelings gotta be in shambles you know?
I've told 3 people today May the 4th Be With You. Felt really cool every time.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Running is April's MO. She needs to realize how her actions affect Jackson before it's too late.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I do wonder if they had April mention they MADE her leave, opposed to choosing to come home on purpose
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril works for him.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Guess Owen felt like it wasn't his business. If April was okay being away from her life then that work
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril as far as what went down during the time she was away.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril No cheating. But who knows what Shonda will pull out of her ass for season 12.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril had they not been attacked.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril BLOWS my mind she left him for that long and kept postponing it and probably would've continued to
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril *high five* as he should. She's lucky I'm not Jackson. I go for the jugular when I am hurt. lol
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Yup. But once that relief washes away.. the hurt is going to return.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril So hopefully homegirl steps up to the wifey plate because she's been MIA for far too damn long.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril when he picked her up, but it was shock that he was being so welcoming I think.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I certainly hope not. I know people were assuming she felt guilty for cheating with that look she had
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril more than enough reason to be mad.
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril her, not knowing he's been worried she was dead in a ditch somewhere. So at least she realizes he has
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril So back to what I was saying.. lol. You are right, she looked like she thought he was gonna be mad at
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril The refusal to admit April wronged Jackson here BLOWS my freakin' mind. Seriously.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril husband list!
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril cannot just be swept under the rug and mark another one off on Jackson's awesome
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril breaking them up and divorcing them and no they can't work it out. But this issue
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril LOLOLOL. Okay, Tracy. I am talking about THIS ISSUE that needs to be resolved. Not
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril treat your husband.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Well she needs to learn a freaking lesson. A lesson on what marriage is and how to
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril gets to run off on him and not care at all about what he's going through?
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Why does Jackson always have to be the soft, understanding, protective one? When she
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril have to treat her with kid gloves after she just disregarded him for a year.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril You're being SO extreme. Jackson can be PISSED he should be PISSED and no he shouldn't
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril happens in life?
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Tell me.. should Jackson expect April to run off for a year every time something bad
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril she missed him oh so much.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril him to be a-okay with it. ESP since she only came back because they made her, not bcuz
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril just can't leave your spouse for a year against their wishes like that and expect
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril April deserves any and all Jackson has to say to her for her disappearing act. You
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril April is not  &gt;&gt;&gt; Jackson and a portion of the fandom seems to believe this.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril being brow beating or punishment? Nah. I can't with that girl. lol
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril BROW beating her? LMAO! Okay so Jackson can't voice his anger and hurt without it
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril completely alone. The hardest year of HIS life as well.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril the right to just piss on Jackson's feelings and not care at all that he spent the yr
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril OH WELL. HE lost  a baby too, FFS. And a wife. Losing THEIR CHILD doesn't give her a
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril the better part of the year is not okay.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I am diff than you, it doesn't matter if Mike is Mike or minutes, leaving him for
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril she doesn't give his feelings or thoughts the time of day.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril I'm just sick of people acting like Jackson needs to treat her with kid gloves, when
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril in.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril better part of the year and didn't seem to care what I felt one way or the other sets
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Relief only lasts for so long though. Then the reality that my wife just left for the
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril prior to the tragic event.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Think if anything, he's been distant with her, and then finally unloads his emotions
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril But one can only bottle it up for SO long, you know what I mean??
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril of reality and what her husband went through while she was off being G.I. Jane
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril But in any case, I don't GAF what makes him "snap" as long as she gets a nice dose
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril considering him enough? Why does he need more than that?
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Why does it have to be external? Isn't his wife bailing for 9 months- a year without
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril when she's off on site and he's back at the hospital. That's how Grey's rolls.
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril finally come to a head right before the tragedy strikes. Things will be sour btw them
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Jackson distant/not himself maybe. But something will be up. And then something will
@JustaThought47 @michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril Could be. I suspect we come back in 23 with things not good between them.
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril away, things are not gonna be good in 23.
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril considering he thought she could be harmed or dead somewhere for a week, but once that relief washes
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril "why should I be okay with this?" I think he was SUPER relieved to see her and that she was okay
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril we going to talk about this or.. did you just decide? "April.. it's Christmas.." plus his talk with AZ
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril over the place that things are about to get sour. Jackson ignoring her call. Him asking her.. soo are
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril There is no way in hell they can come back in 23 and be hunky dory. Just no way. There were signs all
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril They showed him ignoring her call and disagreeing with Arizona for a reason my friends.
@michelebolam @LuvWivLuv @iShipJapril concerns? More like his anger, frustration, his little broken heart :(
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril that close up of Jackson's eyes during the hug in 22.. makes you go hmmm.
@LuvWivLuv @michelebolam @iShipJapril I am pretty confident we will. It has been set up for him to finally unload his feelings.
These fame whores think they're so important. It's pathetic.  
Carly's gonna find out Jake is Jason. Just watch. Just you watch. #GH
I really just need Jakeson to get laid soon, you feel me. #GH
@newf93 @SonnyandBrenda I used to call her Bones.
@SonnyandBrenda @newf93 Chicken arms and freaking Jean Claude Van Damm
This kinda gets me in my feels 
@newf93 @SonnyandBrenda Oh god.. I forgot all about that. With Tams too. Ughhhhh
OMG. Kung Foo Who came back. Bwahahahahahahaaaaaa 
WAIT. WAIT. WHO? came back!??? Shut up. Are you guys for real? #GH
Damn had a meeting and missed the rest of #GH what happened with my boothang Jakeson
@1crightonly More like freaking OUT.
@1crightonly How do you like these apples.. lol 
@1crightonly You should see my picture of me and Maurice when I was 12.. it's embarrassingly awesome.
No matter how douchey Sonny is... Maurice is always gonna be my first love okay.
@MauriceBenard First 3 rounds I was super pumped.. by 7 I was pissed I wasted $100.
Hahahaha I'd bang Jake all day long. Fuck it.  
@MauriceBenard on a scale from 1-10 how mad were you after Saturday's fight
@1crightonly My Jakeson has chem with errbody!
@1crightonly They rarely share scenes. It's weird.
@1crightonly What the hell are they doing with her and Sonny tho.. it's like they put them together because they had nothing else to do.
@1crightonly biggest hypocrite that ever walked into Port Charles. I really like Carly/Jason and Carly/Jake tho.
@1crightonly I have a love hate with her. She entertains the shit out of me and is one of the most consistent characters. But also the
Okay good to see Liz is concerned about Sam and Danny. That's something anyway.. #GH
@1crightonly That's cause for murder in Carly's mind lol
Nikolas you're such a dick! 
@1crightonly Jason. Just like Jason M didn't want Jason Q's life.
@1crightonly I don't think so either, plus his role with the Jerome operation too. Just because he knows he's Jason doesn't make him old
@1crightonly Watch.. calling it now.. Carly is gonna figure it out that he's Jason. And also figure out that Liz knew.
@1crightonly t for his own reasons.
@1crightonly She needs to tell at least him. I think that'd be a better story. He doesn't remember being Jason, he may want to keep it secre
@1crightonly Yeah if Liz keeps this a secret she will deserve every bit of pain coming her way when Jakeson tosses her aside down the road.
Lol 
@1crightonly JFC I just want everyone to know he's Jason already!!
@1crightonly Which makes Liz look super shady because she's also keeping Danny from his dad.
Ahhhh! 
If Liz keeps Jake=Jason a secret, especially from him, I am officially off that bandwagon. On to the next. #GH
And Sabrina has fans now?! Jesus. This is what happens when you try to part-time it #GH
Oh #GH is on.. trying to figure out what's going on with my Jakeson by reading my TL and shit ain't workin.
Well I feel much better knowing my wolfpack is not one man.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly We'll see! We just gotta agree to disagree because we're not just on diff pages but diff books lol
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly her life-changing decisions like moving across the world for most of a year? That'd be super!
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Oh okay so we can she start remembering she has a husband now and a partner in life that should be included in
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly once tragedy strikes.. I suppose that could JUST be Amelia/Mer. But I am hoping against all odds it's Japril 2
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly But so are Mer/Amelia and they still have time to have it out. Plus "doctors putting their emotions aside"
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I'm sayin bring the angst. And Jackson's balls back from April's camo fanny pack. Two thumbs up.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Well, guess we will see Thursday. At least we don't have to wait weeks/months like the rest of the season!
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly then a closeup on Jackson's eyes. Don't think he was smiling. Really think that hug was a fake out.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly They had Jackson showing his frustration/ignoring her call on purpose. Plus.. at the end you see her smile, and
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly Last two episodes of the season with them just hunky dory, being awesome docs? I don't think so.
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly I do, I do. You telling me you think Japril are just gonna be happy lovey/dovey in 23/24 after that??
@1crightonly better.
@1crightonly over him and make decision that affect them both and just be happy that she had a good time over in Afghanistan and is feeling
@1crightonly I dunno, people flipping out on me for saying Jackson SHOULD be mad at her. Like his only role in life is to let her walk all
@JustaThought47 @1crightonly It'd be nice if she took her own advice there  but that's just me! hahahaha
Hey..I'm at 300 followers, cool. Back on my old Twittuh I had like 1500. The difference from when you fangirl soap operas and when you don't
@1crightonly he unloads all of the feelings he's been carrying around for the past year.
@1crightonly I hope everyone handing out free passes to April for staying away for so long hand out those same free passes to Jackson when
I forever do not answer calls if I don't know the number. Just the way it is. Leave a message.
Exactly Mary. Exactly.  
@1crightonly reason to be that pissed.
@1crightonly Honestly something like 10x2 is exactly what needs to happen. Perhaps not as harsh, but hell maybe just as harsh. He has every
@ShawnMarieH @MaryScarlett2u This is worse than trying to figure out Game of Thrones titles.
@ShawnMarieH @MaryScarlett2u Guess we'll just get a head start on it then huh hahaha. Princess Catherine just sounds cooler than Duchess.
@1crightonly gurl.. don't get me started on Benley's 25 minute convo about whether they'd pull the plug or not. JFC. SHUT UP. lol
@1crightonly Plus "doctors must put emotions aside" doesn't scream happy go lucky to me either. Hoping hoping J gets to lay it out.
@1crightonly I refuse to believe things are going to be hunky dory between them in 23. I will call major bullshit if it is.
@ShawnMarieH @MaryScarlett2u Earl.. is that a family or a title? I am hopeless!!
@ShawnMarieH @MaryScarlett2u Was Princess Di not a commoner? I thought she was but I don't know much of anything.
@1crightonly see her face on Christmas and how worried he was, I am about 400% he did not cheat during the year.
@1crightonly but there's no way Shonda let's that year go by and not bring something up from it. And the way Jackson was so excited to just
@1crightonly Not to mention how pissed he would be to find out she was bonding with this man and he was all by himself. I could be way off
@ShawnMarieH @MaryScarlett2u Well she's Princess Kate to me and Mary. lol we're commoners too so we don't care!
@1crightonly for her. Shit would hit the roof real quick.
@1crightonly yup.. and confiding in another man about their loss while he was back at home waiting for her.. esp if this man has the hots
@1crightonly And I can't see April physically cheating, ever, but bonding with another man while being away for so long.. yes. Could see it.
@1crightonly future.
@1crightonly I sure hope that it doesn't happen. But Shonda ain't gonna let a year flash by like that and not bring some surprises in the
@1crightonly wife, meanwhile April is being badass Dr. G.I. Jane and bonding with another man over the loss of her baby. That's so Shonda.
@1crightonly I could so see something like that happening. Jackson at home, miserable and alone, dealing with the loss of his baby and his
@1crightonly like something Shonda would do. SOMETHING is gonna come up from that year away. Guarantee it.
@1crightonly she was bonding with this man, confiding the loss of their child, etc. A man that may even have a thing for her. It just sounds
@1crightonly probably just as Jackson/April get back into a really good spot. Only for him to learn not only did she stay away for so long
@1crightonly the loss of the baby, etc.. in him. And I just have this feeling that someone is gonna show up next season from this Army trip
@1crightonly Only a feeling.. I think April bonded with another male soldier/doctor over there (not cheat, but bond) and probably confided
This. All day.  
@iShipJapril Dr. G.I. Jane!
@iShipJapril RIGHT! She didn't act like she missed him AT ALL meanwhile he's miserable and pining for his wife. She's off having fun being
@iShipJapril If April wants to live off on her own &amp; make decision w/o considering anyone else's feelings, she shouldn't be a married woman.
@iShipJapril did she return.
@iShipJapril On the phone at Christmas she didn't seem like she was coming home anytime soon. Only after they were attached and FORCED home
@iShipJapril I take April's side a lot but I refuse to give her a free pass for this. It was messed up what she did to Jackson. Period.
@iShipJapril repeatedly.. without caring how he felt about it.
@iShipJapril that she was leaving for 3 months and of course being Jackson he tries to support that. Then she just postpones coming home
@iShipJapril She made her decisions like she was a single woman and had no one else to consider. Repeatedly. She gave him ONE DAY's notice
@iShipJapril I do not know.
@iShipJapril Which she clearly already decided she wasn't returning home. Jackson has been getting the SHAFT and how everyone can't see that
@iShipJapril Omg yes yes yes. He was like soo.. do you want to discuss this like a married couple or did you just make the decision yourself
@MaryScarlett2u @ShawnMarieH hahaha gmta
@MaryScarlett2u @ShawnMarieH I call her Princess Kate and I don't care what those Brits say about it.
@iShipJapril She needs to start acting like she cares about Jackson at all. I feel so bad for the guy :(
@iShipJapril need it to go.
@iShipJapril in any case.. 23 says the doctors must put aside their emotions when tragedy strikes. Another clue that it might go the way we
@iShipJapril time? Last I checked marriage was a partnership. Jackson's been riding solo for a while now.
@iShipJapril being normal and happily married, he's just supposed to drop the life he's been living for the past year because SHE says it's
@iShipJapril but intentions only matter for so long. Actions are what count. And now that April decides it's time for them to go back to
@iShipJapril No matter how you want to excuse it or rationalize it.. she did wrong by Jackson. She hurt him deeply. Maybe not intentionally
@iShipJapril Yesss so glad that people are seeing it like I see it. I was feeling very alone.. haha
Preach it to the choir.  
@iShipJapril doesn't seem like it these days.
@iShipJapril all I am saying is Jackson deserves better treatment from the woman that's supposed to love him above all else. Because it sure
@iShipJapril to start calling her Freepass April. lol
@iShipJapril But apparently this wasn't running because it wasn't IMMEDIATELY after the baby died so she gets another free pass. I am going
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv our girl @michelebolam is also very sore with April/wants Jackson to tell her what's up.
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv disregard her husband. FOR NEARLY A YEAR btw. lol
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv spouse. And just because April was having a hard time mourning doesn't give her a free pass to just completely
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv It's honestly blowing my mind. Maybe because I am married and know that's not how you're supposed to treat your
@iShipJapril @LuvWivLuv I don't get it either honestly. I think everyone just wants Japril to be happy-happy-happy they don't care w/happens
@iShipJapril bad happens in life? That's a whole OTHER issue people want to forget.
@iShipJapril ALSO.. how is Jackson supposed to trust April won't run away again? Is it supposed to fear she might leave every time something
@iShipJapril in 23.. lots of F bombs will be dropped. lol
@iShipJapril I will be incredibly disappointed. And also kinda disgusted how pathetic they are making him be. If they're just fine and dandy
@iShipJapril Like seriously. Give the man his balls back. There's a fine line between incredibly understanding and doormat, ya know.
@iShipJapril something or I am gonna rage lol
@iShipJapril Thank you, yes! If they sweep this under the rug, Jackson goes from SUPER understanding husband to doormat. He HAS to say
@iShipJapril gonna be angsty for Japril.
@iShipJapril I think that 24 saying the tragedy brings everyone together and reminds them what is important is a good indicator that 23 is
@iShipJapril There's just no way they can come back this week and being happy-go-lucky, perfect couple is perfect. No way in hell.
@iShipJapril the adrenaline.
@iShipJapril her marriage at all. And I don't think she stayed that long to get healed. She stayed because she was having fun and enjoying
@iShipJapril Yeah, good for HER. For her marriage? Not so much. Jackson has every right to be sore with her. It appears she does not value
@iShipJapril perfectly fine with being away from her husband for such a long ass time while he's at home missing her.
@iShipJapril There had better be angst. April needs to know how much she hurt him by a. completely disregarding him entirely and b. being
@iShipJapril sure did not seem that way when she kept extending her stay.
@iShipJapril That is my point. Had they not been attacked, would she have even came home? Probably not. Did she miss Jackson?? Because it
@iShipJapril there will be trouble for them. Also you could only see his eyes during that hug, she was smiling. I don't think he was.
@iShipJapril I desperately want him to lay it out for her. I think him ignoring her call and his response to Arizona in 22 indicates that
@iShipJapril me lose my mind. No, she didn't HAVE to leave her husband for that long. I'm sorry, but no.
@iShipJapril Yes, THANK YOU for acknowledging April DID do something wrong here. People trying to say she HAD TO DO IT are starting to make
@iShipJapril If Jackson ISN'T sore with her over it, I will call bullshit. Any normal person would be very hurt by that.
@iShipJapril heal than to bail on your husband for nearly a year, against his wishes.
@iShipJapril It was sad, because she didn't consider Jackson at all. I am also happy she is better, but I am sorry there are other ways to
@iShipJapril and frustrations to her. No more treating her like glass. Let her know EXACTLY how he feels about it.
@iShipJapril hater, I just call it like I see it. We all have flaws and make mistakes. I just want Jackson to be able to voice his feelings
@iShipJapril I can say that April was selfish and thoughtless when it came to her husband and her marriage. That doesn't make me a April
everyone flip their script. Just you watch.
Also I have a gut feeling about a storyline that's going to branch off her army experience in season 12. If it plays that way, we'll see
I love April and everyone knows that. It's part of the fandom's refusal to hold her accountable for her treatment of her husband.
real jerk to not take her husband/marriage into consideration when she decided to bail for 9 months to a year. Does that mean I hate her? No
Jackson was a real dick for sleeping with Stephanie at Bailey's wedding and said as much for a very long time. So I can think April was a
messed up in one way or the other. They're human and humans make mistakes. Doesn't mean you now hate that character. For instance I thought
If she did nothing wrong, he wouldn't have the right to be upset, right? I don't understand people's refusal to admit when their faves have
Someone explain to me how you can say Jackson has the right to be upset/angry but in the same breath say April did nothing wrong? Anyone???
@tunnel_visioned accountant. You can imagine how eventful my days are.. lol
@tunnel_visioned Don't rush it girl. It will come to you when it is time. I wish I had taken more time to figure out my passion. Now I am an
This is the greatest video of my life. My Monday is instantly better. ELMO!!! 
@michelebolam sent you a DM when you get a chance ;)
@tunnel_visioned ha! a fear we've all had, no doubt. Fortunately I've never had  employer care about my GPA, just as long as I had degree
@tunnel_visioned clearly I am an overachiever
@tunnel_visioned C's get degrees. That was always my motto.
Megan Fox is too hot.. hot damn.  
I've really sold myself on Jo being part of the #PlasticsPosse can we please make this happen @camilluddington #GreysAnatomy
Rich folk.  
how we all feel about @iJesseWilliams  
I really need a work out buddy to hold me accountable.
@iShipJapril Thank you! I mean that's confusing right, it's not just me? lol
I would have preferred to just watch it with you and Vin but that's just me.  
Is it Wales? I mean.. isn't that a place. These Brits confuse me.
Stupid question.. no one laugh.. but what is Prince William's/Harry's last name? Stop laughing.
I feel like maybe some online shopping will help me get through this Monday.
I was gonna name my baby girl Charlotte and changed it at the last minute. Adore that name!!!
Yesssss I do! Wilson, Warren, and Avery.. da Posse. Unless Ben bails in that case #byefelicia  
They're cute. 
Ready for Thursday.. fingers crossed my Jackman finally gets to voice his feelings! #GreysAnatomy
@ShawnMarieH Her name and title alone reminds me of what a loser I am.
Still pissed I paid $100 for that sorry excuse of a boxing match. Smh.
That's literally the best name I've ever heard. 
Which btw she 100% agrees with me. Validation.
Legit just laid out a Grey's storyline for my co-worker to make sure my thoughts on the matter weren't crazy. You know you're a fangirl when
Addicted to checking credit karma.. damn this website. But haaaay movin' on up.
Stupidly caught up on #GH spoilers and now I am pissed. You're telling me Liz is gonna keep Jake=Jason a secret? WTF!
I'm too hot..
Looks like me on a rough morning.  
Lol ba-da-boom.  
I don't know about you but I'm just so excited it's Monday.
Really dreading Mothers Day this year.
Yes 
Am I the only one who didn't know that Jason reveal was happening? I screamed tho #GH
When you see a Norman Buckley retweet and remember his obsession with Dair.. <UNAMUSED FACE>
When people you don't know or care to know threaten to unfollow you. #byefelicia
@kepnerlove later girl!! Lol
@kepnerlove do you really think he should be okay she postponed her homecoming for nearly a year? Doesn't he have a right to be upset?
@kepnerlove so tell me.. when does Jackson get support? When does she start caring how he feels and thinks? When dies his opinion matter?
She made a completely selfish choice and now her marriage will be rocky due to it. The give and take of life my friends.
Doesn't include leaving your newlywed spouse in the dust for the better part of a year. Wtf lol
I can't understand that reasoning. Sge lost a baby so that means she had to go across the world to heal because there's no alternative that
Also.. interesting people think leaving your life behind for a year is the only way one can heal. Anyone ever heard of therapy???
Trying to figure out how people can say Jackson has the right to be angry but absolves April of any wrongdoing. How does that work??
My girl! 
Vin stop! I'm trying to get over my lifelong obsession of Vin and Michelle getting married and having babies damn! 
Is this legit? Am I being faked out? Someone tell me. #GH
I've never wanted a Monday #GH to get here faster! Jason Morgan motherfuckers. Hotter and with a personality <OK HAND SIGN>
Elizabeth! Jake.. is Jason. OMFG OMFG FINALLY OMFG #GH NO ONE TOLD ME THIS HAPPENED
I got: "You're an expert, dude!" (16 out of 16! ) - Are You A Full House Expert? 
I've come to the conclusion that I'm only really into #TheVoice until it's the live rounds. Then it's just whatever.
Why is it I can wear my bra all day with no problems but as soon as I walk over the threshold it's got me in a vice grip?
Pumped for this fight. #PacquiaoMayweather
Just got majorly hit on by a super hot guy. Ah, I still got it! #seethering
@michelebolam would've stayed longer had they not been attacked. Smh!
@michelebolam there's no excuse for her bailing on him for a whole year. And then not even act like it bothered her to be away from him. She
@michelebolam just not including her in any of his day to day. Why would he she's been gone a fucking YEAR.
@michelebolam glad someone is on the same page lol I was feeling like a one man wolfpack.
@michelebolam like he should just be lime OMG your back yay back to being super awesome husband. Fuck that!!!!
@michelebolam having inside jokes with others, making plans that didn't include her, etc. She deserves it. Give her a taste of being alone.
@michelebolam marriage is a two way street. Jackson's been the only one driving for a long time :(
@michelebolam until she acknowledges his feelings and how she hurt him, I don't want him being lovey with her.
@michelebolam I see him just going about his business like when she was gone and giving her the cold shoulder. I certainly would.
@michelebolam Yup if things are good between them in 23 I call major bullshit. Once the relief of seeing her is over I see him pulling away.
@michelebolam exactly! Hope he's withdrawing from her.
@michelebolam I've never wanted 1/2 of my OTP to be mad at the other half so bad in.my life.
@michelebolam change in a year? It was probably awkward when they got home. Lol
@michelebolam Really needing them to show how much she hurt Jackson. This better not be swept under a rug. Also do you know how much people
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha put him first :(
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha something else out there always better than him to the people who should
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha Poor Jackson tho. I feel for him so much. Always getting left.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha sigh.. we can only hope she sees the light.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha because they wanted him totally alone <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha this decision def proved how immature in relationships she is.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha care.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha but she was healing lol wtf ever Jackson needed his wife and she didnt
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha I do but I'm also able to be mad at her when she deserves it.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha for a year + since that's how April heals.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha guess everytime something bad happens Jackson can expect to be wifeless
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha hope I'm not so mad at her I care. Lol
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha gone 5 years next time.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha like I said hope they don't suffer anymore tragedy she might just stay
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha well April was "healing" so that's all that matters lol
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha away from him for a year?? I mean really.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha hows he supposed to feel knowing his wife was perfectly content being
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha Yup yup. She just didn't GAF what he wanted or needed.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha not real.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha I'm so pissed on his behalf it's not even funny lol but is since he's
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha he wanted her home? Not OK.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha See! Yes. 3 months ok. I understand. Extending it repeatedly knowing
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha can shit on him, leave him for a YEAR, get comfort from anyone but him.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha why does Jackson have to be super supportive faithful husband when April
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha fucking wake up call.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha same here, and usually more on April's. But this??? No. She needs a
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha disregards him entirely.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha it's okay to see it that way. Jackson did NOTHING to deserve the way she
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha April doesn't need a cheerleader. Sometimes characters are in the wrong
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha him to be mad. She just didn't care enough to leave before she had to.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha she has to. The look on her face at the hospital indicated she expected
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha because she's too self absorbed unfortunately. She knows he's upset.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha worked!!! Ya think?! I hope he's salty as hell personally.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha hmm maybe that opposed yo leaving her husband for a year could have
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha how much she hurt him, disregards him, and takes him for granted.
@michelebolam @autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha I hope not. I will be pissed if things are good. She needs to realize
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha marriage.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha enjoyed the adrenaline and wanted to stay for that. Regardless of her
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha also don't think it took a year to heal. Think she got over there and
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha strained next week. Really hope.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha accountable and not excused. I really hope their relationship is
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha no their situation is easily fixed. April just needs to be held
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha Michele is right that Jackson is like the woman of this marriage.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha also its nice she just missed him so much she didn't wanna leave :/
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha and didn't fuck around on her like a lot of men would have.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha because that was 100% completely selfish. She's lucky J is a good guy
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha well I can appreciate you saying she deserves some hell for that.
@autismteach11 I'm  usually  April's. New territory
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha no one would understand their spouse needing a year away from them.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha no leaving him for a year is not something he understands.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha just call me Jackson's bodyguard in this particular instance.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha you guys can make excuses for April all day. Nothing excuses a year.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha after promising him 3 months.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha a year. A year after they got married, she leaves him for a year.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha and I'm saying it was fucked up of her. Period. She bailed on him for
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha be there for better or worse. Once again, Jackson comes last.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha but not squat about what Jackson needs from the woman who promised to
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha one last thing.. all I hear is how April needed it. It's what she needed
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha 3 months I could've handled. A year, no. I don't want to argue tho.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha I am just gonna stop discussing this now. I can't with that.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha she had to stay away for a year?? I can't with that.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha next time.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha Well hope they don't suffer any more tragedy. She may stay gone 5 yrs
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha him be alone for an entire year. Yay April.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha I'm glad she found herself at the expense of hurting Jackson and making
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha A year Tracy. Lol. A fucking YEAR??? No. I can't.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha That would not fly in the real world, I'm sorry.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha So the ONLY way for April to "find herself" was to leave him for a year.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha another 9, knowing it hurt him. How am I supposed to see her side.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha he agreed to 3 months, which is actually a LONG time. She extended it
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha should take her husbands needs and feelings into consideration.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha Man I disagree so much. She's not a single woman. She's married and
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha sometimes she's just WRONG.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha yall know I love April I've been giving her free passes all season. But
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha she knew she was hurting him, yet still stayed. I can't see that side
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha so tell me her side. She looked like she expected him to be upset. So
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @michelebolam @1crightonly @gail_sha you lost me at but.. lol
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha no he really doesn't. He's more concerned with hers. Bottles his up.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha twlight zone. There's nothing to excuse her leaving him for a year.
@autismteach11 @michelebolam @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha I'm honestly shocked I am the only one upset on Jackson's behalf lol
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha husband wants you home.. no. Just no.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha LEAVE HER for a year. A 3 month tour ok. Extending that shit repeatedly knowing your
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha well like most spouses in love with their wife, I can't forsee him ever wanting to
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha by bailing on him for a whole MFing year.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha To me she took a nice giant dump on him and her marriage. Her NEWLYWED marriage.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha that.
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha to go get happy so saying she'd support him is bogus. No spouse would be happy about
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha and selfish. Her needs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his. And Jackson would never want to leave her for a year
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha I don't GAF how anyone slices it or excuses it. It was bullshit. Unfair to Jackson.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha excited when she was coming home after the original tour only to be told sorry no.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha because she didn't care. She did what she wanted, who cares what he wants. He was so
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha well jesus christ a year later I imagine so. I honestly can't get the excuses for her
@JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha He was annoyed IMO that she made the decision without talking about it.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha She knew he didn't want her to go, but he supported her because he's a good husband.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha extending it. Not once. Not twice. 3 times.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha for three months. Which he was not happy about. Does that excuse her CHOICE to keep
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha I'm sorry girls. I just need something from April to make me not so mad at her. :(
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha means she's not completely clueless. Also means she knew she was hurting him.
@autismteach11 @JustaThought47 @1crightonly @gail_sha well at least she's aware enough of her selfishness to assume he was mad.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha left HER for a year to go get happy. I'm sure that would've flown.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha if the roles were reversed I'd be livid at Jackson too. Imagine if he
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha I just need her to acknowledge him man. I don't want to resent her but
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha have to spell that shit out.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha have to but since his wife doesn't give them a second thought he's gonna
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha that's what I'm saying. He needs to voice his feelings! He shouldn't
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha we got a while before she starts fucking with them too much.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha after YEARS tho lol Japril have been together since mid last season.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha please believe if I was Jackson she'd be getting the ol brushoff.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha realize how unfair she is to him.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha this is totally different and easily rectified. She just needs to
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha No I don't think so please don't compare them to Crowen and Calzona lol
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha no she doesn't :( it's always about her. Never him.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha consideration and prioritizing her marriage would go a long way.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha I don't need her to make sacrifices. Simply taking his feelings into
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha she has no regard for her marriage or her husband. Takes him for granted
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha Yup!!! Her extending 3 MFing times is such bullshit.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha Jackson deserves better treatment. No one can make me think otherwise.
@michelebolam @JustaThought47 @autismteach11 @1crightonly @gail_sha time in partucular was just so unbelievably shitty.
