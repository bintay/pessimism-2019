I'm so not excited for this math exam... .~.
@eelezzor probably calculus if my work doesn't mind the weird schedule.
Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there. :) Staying strong especially if you're young and doing your best!
I believe everybody will suffer some sort of limitations. But that shouldn't be the reason why to stop. Make the best of what you got.
@eelezzor oh no, my exam is just based off the chapters we've reviewed since the last test :) thank god lol
@eelezzor what's cumulative mean? xD my class is at 6pm to 7:20pm.
@eelezzor idunno yet... If I feel confident enough, maybe Tuesday. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@eelezzor I can either choose to go on Tuesday or Thursday. It'll be on both days next week though. And we can only take the test once.
And then he loses the fight and he's like "She's never gonna go to a ball now" <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
In Yes Man, Jim Carey's like "If I win the fight, then I get to take her to a ball"
I need a new twitcon but I need someone to take my photo and I need to model again.
The Negatives is a catchy song off their new album. :)
Dude, the Early November's new stuff though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@eelezzor well the grading system is weird, but I'm at a B, and this final exam determines whether it stays a B or if I can reach an A. :(
@eelezzor I don't remember his name, but he looks like the kid from Stuart little if he were an old guy. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I think it's like prof Theodore.
@eelezzor :) yeah xD
@eelezzor THATS SO FUNNY. Because my teacher was literally going over that same problem. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Renikkuhh niggas hella soup'd <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Renikkuhh thank god your safe dude :(  nobody deserves that shit.
I'm excited for summer because I wanna write material again. <RELIEVED FACE>
@downxbeat did I say band, I meant just you though :) but either way, it wouldn't work out in general :( aw man. I hope it's nice there.
@downxbeat :( I wish I wasn't so busy... I would've loved doing band practice witchu!
Going to work is never a good day. I hate this life. <PENSIVE FACE> Can I just skip to the part I'm done with college...?
I guess that makes my twitcon inaccurate. Oh <SPOUTING WHALE>.
I totally just shave the sides and back of my hair, and I totally love it. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I'M DOME WITH MY ENGLISH RESEARCH PAPER FINALLY. :') Now I just have to do a take home exam, a speech, some chemistry, and math homework. <RELIEVED FACE><PISTOL>
@Staygoldmiles @jessieanne96 this is a nice picture :)
@waldo124 thanks <WINKING FACE><KISSING FACE WITH CLOSED EYES>
@_ChefTia_ <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> there's never too much!
On another note, my coworkers were roasting me at work. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Freaking assholes. :') They're funny though.
I feel like regardless of whoever wins between Pacquiao and Mayweather, there will be awkward tension in the outcome... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I haven't changed my twitcon in awhile, but I really like this one. I feel like if I switch, I'm gonna get over it too quick...
@ItsStephanee I like how your hand pockets have zippers :')
@Renikkuhh :) I always mess up when I do it, so you probably are safer with a barber xD
@Renikkuhh I always cut my hair by myself .~.
@_ChefTia_ I should've took a picture of mine to show you :') my groups was weird looking lol
@_ChefTia_ I snuck in a story so far line onto the mural <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_ChefTia_ WE DID. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> Wondering how this crap is relevant. HAHHA. :') I swear this teacher just makes up excuses to kill time in class. lol
Or at least change your ideals from supporting feminism, to just equality for everyone. Stop labeling to claim yourself a victim.
I mean if you wanna attack rape culture, that's different than equality. But grow up, everybody gets shit.
Because let's face it, in a sense, nobody is treated equal. So when somebody supports feminism, really you're just being selfish.
People think why doesn't anyone take feminism seriously? Well you'd think that equality is less important than the real issues behind it.
Why the hell is the follow button on the tweet. Now I'm supposed to dodge the favorite button, retweets, and Follow. <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
I swear, this new update is more like a downgrade because my iPod acts more crippling than ever. Like I can't even load crap.
Geez... <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> everybody favoriting that ugly picture I took on my little sisters phone. How embarrassing... Lol.
And the smoke smelled like fish. And my coworker freaking said "Oh, I thought it was just a really bad UTI." <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> LOL.
The fire department literally had to come to my work because there was smoke coming from our air ventilation.
@DerrickTheRaddd you're car was just a few parking spots from mine. (; 
@eelezzor I'm a bit behind on mine too. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> But at least you ain't majoring in something lame~ :)
In other words, so something you can progress in. Instead of knowing what you learned and bam. Get to work.
I feel like memorizing stuff isn't a talent. Because that doesn't get you from point A to point B. It's just cramming material...
@downxbeat okay
@downxbeat I'd buy you some and drive you. :( but I have class.
@chelsea_smilee basically :( lol
Man I have a 3 hour class and my stomach feels like poop man. And my body won't let me poop. :(
Have you guys noticed that Hozie unfollowed everyone on Instagram besides 1 person? Guess who it is...? It's that flat ass Talor Swift. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Got a long day at work... .___.
@downxbeat I'll see you Friday :) and celebrate or something
@downxbeat I'm gonna miss you. :(
Even though I didn't see you much. You're presence around here is enough of a blessing. <PENSIVE FACE><BROKEN HEART>
When you're good at math and can use it in real life to split costs based off pay rate or amount of money in the bank. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@downxbeat @LoveKadence can't blame Jon, he's need extra attention since he's extra special. <HEART WITH ARROW>
And it's already been over a year <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I feel like people have hit me up on my old phone number, because I never took the time to update everyone on my new number... Oops. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I have all my contacts saved onto my iPod but not on my phone. So whenever I wanna text someone, I have to look at my iPod for their number.
so who wants to supply me the edibles for 420 blaze it... .___.
Blastin' The Story So Far for days. Man, as much as I want May to come for their new album. Then the closer to Finals. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> smh.
If that was my son's math homework, I'd add 96 more math addition problems. And give him some subtraction.
My nephew's homework is literally 4 math problems. And it's 1+4=?, 1+9=?, 1+5=?, and 2+1=?. I literally wrote his assignment on a tweet.
@downxbeat you're still bae
@downxbeat Pero like si. I'm be there. I'm thank you.
@waldo124 this is literally me every morning before I go to bed. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Troyboyyyyyy or is it the other way around...? Am I un-favoriting all your tweets...?
When you're scrolling and accidentally favorite a tweet... .___. this is awk.
@JohnCodyyy :) uh suhweeeet
If life is a competition, then I'm sorry to say your life's goals revolves around everyone else's goals.
Überfacts messed up. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> so I unfollowed them. lol @UberFacts 
@stevebays Those are the only words I need to know to explode in excitement <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I don't want to go yo work... <WEARY FACE> lol... Can I just sleep.
Waiting for May so some of my favorite bands can releasing some albums.
Ace Enders inspires me so much as a writer and artist. :) @ace_enders
@stevebays But the real question is when will be the date for more, awesome Hot Hot Heat tracks. :')
@Renikkuhh no bueno. This is your que dude! <WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE><WINKING FACE>
@Renikkuhh xD truuu. Did your brothers get dragged too?
@Brittballs_ They say people who try to live positive are the ones who are most likely depressed, so...
@Renikkuhh I hated those days. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> time to go to church in Spanish and just sit there. Not understanding a thing...
@Brittballs_ Gayyyy.... Literally.
I'm so disappointed with myself. I'm took apart my drums. And I am no longer playing instruments or ds until I get my grade up in math.
Sometimes I wonder why do I even put things in front of me when I can't even manage to take care of myself.
@Renikkuhh das my shit right there
@SouIsideJourney Dude. Sometimes I eat cookies with water... o.0 Idunno. Water feels more natural sometimes... lol
@eelezzor I noticed that too. I guess math just gets to complicated it has to be an elective. xD
@eelezzor I'm not really sure... Because I don't understand reading these classes sometimes. o.0 but I don't see "Math" in year 4 or 5. lol
@eelezzor I was actually undecided into what field along the lines of mechanical and electrical and a few others before.
@eelezzor oh sweet. :) you seem pretty organized. I was thinking maybe grad school too. Because there's always room for knowledge.
@eelezzor I'm on a 5 year plan because I'm lame lol. :( lol. And it's electrical. You?
@eelezzor yeah xD
WHO THE HELL SMILES BECAUSE LEARNING IS EXCITING? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> THIS GUY. <THUMBS UP SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WHITE LEFT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX>
I feel like a loser when I start smiling in math class because I learned something new like all of a sudden life makes sense. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
You know how goats can climb walls, so I was wondering if any of them have fallen. So I searched up videos, and yes, it does happen.
School and work... When's summer again?
I already feel burnt out doing this homework. :(
@Renikkuhh Me every time.
@shhhnitzell the doge's name is mikasa <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> that's so brilliant. :')
The Early November has some of the coolest jams. :) And they're not jerks. <THUMBS UP SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
But The Early November's booth had my size and I was like, this will have to do. And they gave me free pins a stickers for my purchase. :')
I remember at Warped I was looking to buy a tank top, but no one had my size for a decent one.
I don't think people get it. Regardless of what tragic situation or hardship you've been through. If you're an asshole, you're an asshole.
I hate Tuesdays. But at least I get a Friday afternoon because of how my Tuesday works.
This is Odyssey. Or short for Od. (Like oh-dee) He is the Oderbug. I just wanted to show you him guys. Goodnight. 
Have you followed certain pages because they're actually interesting. Then they become spam pages. Well, that was a good run. #unfollowed
@FunkyGhoe I wish my schedule wasn't so tight. :( Hopefully I can squeeze in some time to chill with you guys.
@FunkyGhoe oh there you are. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Where did my life go. Where are all my friends. Where am I.
@PaolaKoallla it really is <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> there stuff feels so natural and refreshing
@chelsea_smilee this is my life <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Life will write the words, but you choose your own melody. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Renikkuhh truu <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><DOG FACE>
@Renikkuhh he's my doge dog
I'm okay with life at the moment.
Hey guys 
@JayyyCsogi @BimmerCars vaccuum cleaners <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Sullliebby <HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW>
@IBarrens_ aw man :( no bueno.
@downxbeat @IBarrens_ big buff dude, and a moth has the balls to attack you
My boss is cool because she let me buy a drink with her money. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> she's too sweet.
This is my greatest achievement of all time. And I haven't even started Calculus yet. <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><PISTOL> 
I'm black.
That was sarcasm by the way. It ain't hard if all you have to do is go to school. I envy y'all niggas.
Cudos to the people who are doing good in school and have no job. Because that takes talent... To get good grades. Only focus on school.
I hate work because it interferes with my learning process. I can't even study or take more time to focus on homework to make sure it's ok.
I'm hungry and yeah. Somebody feed me pls.
@AsiaVsTheWorld They are amazing. :') And miss you too buddy 'o pal.
@AsiaVsTheWorld Hey! :) The Wombats are freaking awesome! Lol
If you guys haven't listened to this amazing album. Then you mine as well go check it out. Freaking amazing. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> 
One of the doctors at my work said if he should join Facebook. And I said that he shouldn't because Facebook is dead and lame.
Don't wanna go to class. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> But spring break is almost here... lol
@Troyboyyyyyy I've been listening to their new stuff a lot recently and holy shit it's amazing. <RELIEVED FACE>
So I'm 20 now. I feel old and still look like I'm 14 or something.
On a brighter note, my math teacher's armpit sweat was seeping through his button up. I guess you can say it's intense for him too. <OK HAND SIGN>
School is intense. Like dying would be fine. But I guess in the meantime, I'll just have to live.
There was a tiny lizard just chilling in front of the garage door. I wish I could just chill and look cool like him. 
But then again, his name was Gunner and we'd call him Gunnerhea. So I guess touché.
I remembered this one time in middle school, my friend said I had buttery yellow teeth.
@therettes I don't get it. Playing warped has so much more fun and hype. What do you do at a Kanye concert. Do you just stand there...? o.0
@_ChefTia_ thank you :') maybe that's what I needed, someone to recognize my efforts. <FISTED HAND SIGN> :)
You know what, I'm not even mad anymore. At least I have insurance, freaking drums, a car, and am able to pay for myself.
But instead I'm a full time student, working full time, and having money taken away from me so freeloaders can get, you know... Freeloaded.
I wanna be lazy too. And get handed down. So I can spend quality money and hang out. And have free time. And worry only for school.
@JBarrens_ @MerchMane Girls are gross. And they have vaginas. And that's gross.
@JBarrens_ me too. I know your birthday is on the 5th.
@JBarrens_ @MerchMane ^Thats why I'm gay.
@WinterIstComing pretty interesting. But I see like a blue and an olive green. So I don't know where that places me.
@Kinky_grandma oh yeah, i can totally relate dude
And you know, not like wise. xD
Lately, every time I've been hanging out with valeria. I'm playing Monster Hunter on my 3ds. Because I need to fit that in my schedule.
@FoliasLuc Pshh, that's the fucking life right about now. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> Fuck work and school. Hahha.
@JBarrens_ but you have a talented voice with so much power. <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm guilty of sometimes using the words gay and retarded. And then it hit me, I'm not using it for it's right context. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> but I should stop.
@JBarrens_ and make music. :(
Valeria is gonna paint me a painting :) and I drew her the picture so all she has to do is paint. 
I feel so tired... So... damn... tired... everyday. But its my weekend, so instead I'm going to stay up.
Do you even math bro?
If I get a tattoo, it's gonna be like the Pythagorean Theorem with a triangle or the Unit Circle. Because no one wants that shit and I math.
Oh yeah, if you haven't had The Human Bean. It's so much better than Starbucks and at a more convenient price too. 
I'm wearing my Neck Deep tank top. And now I feel more happy all of a sudden. :) @NeckDeepUK
School is getting harder to the point that'd is rather go to work than school now. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> and that's saying something... lol.
@_ChefTia_ I'm going in for electrical engineering <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_ChefTia_ Idunno. :) Math is a cool concept cause everything goes together. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> and idunno... It's gonna be in my career path anyways. lol
Dude am I weird because I've been contemplating on buying books on math and stuff... To get more insight... o.0
I just got a brand new game and I wanna play it but I have to do other stuff. Hml.
@IBarrens_ we'll figure something out ok :)
@IBarrens_ but I don't have internet on my phone ivan. :( lol. I use my iPod wifi <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@IBarrens_ :)))) okay. And if your not home, then I'll just try another day. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_Coronaaaa what I did a year ago.
@IBarrens_ Nigga ain't got a phone though! Lol. Ima just come through at your door unexpected.
@IBarrens_ no bueno. :( I shoulda rolled through. Maybe some day when I get off work early.
@IBarrens_ I keep meaning to tell you I pass your house every time I drive to and from work. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> but you don't have a phone I can text. :(
I don't wanna work tomorrow. I just wanna hang out with valeria. And get some boba or something... man. I miss her.
Some people are really weird... and I'm just like... .___.
“@BBAnimals: Carl washing his hands ' 
I don't wanna go to school, I just wanna stay home and wish it's Friday... <PENSIVE FACE> I'm too sleepy already dang.
@_ChefTia_ true. I got an A grade and I hella expected a C because I failed to try. lol
@_ChefTia_ with the chick who slept with the dead person. <NEUTRAL FACE> that was really weird and awkward.... <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_ChefTia_ oops, that's probably my friend. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I'll go remind them too! LOL.
@_ChefTia_ that's so funny xD I'm surprised I didn't log off lol. thanks!
@_ChefTia_ oops! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I thought it would log out itself... dang. Thanks for the heads up :')
@JBarrens_ you guys are mean to Tyler still. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> but the shit you guys come up and say is ridiculous.
@AsiaVsTheWorld WHAT THE FUCK. My dog's name is Raikou. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@_ChefTia_ :') Lol! That's funny actually. Well, kudos to class tomorrow. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WINE GLASS><WINE GLASS>
@_ChefTia_ I noticed that. He always talks about assignments. But we never so anything. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> he said make sure to have key points though. lol
@_ChefTia_ :') that's so funny! Hahhah!
@_ChefTia_ oh yeah. Is it the same professor? Like dr Mosley? I noticed he doesn't really teach xD it's like an easy A lol
@_ChefTia_ True! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm actually glad I have English because I usually work at 8 instead. So it gives it a different feel I guess.
I'm already tired of tomorrow and it hasn't started yet.
I'm still sad Warped and Extreme Thing isn't happening. :( what will I look forward to all year??? :(
Listening to Lydia reminds me of winter.
My teacher sucks at teaching math unfortunately. But I'm slowly kind of getting it because of the interwebs.
@IBarrens_ I know... <PENSIVE FACE> I wish more people drove on the roads safely.
@IBarrens_ aw man. :( stuff like this scares me and my friends.
@lunelupe hey :( you don't even have me added. So you can't say anything.
@lunelupe I do. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I snap chat every once in awhile. lol.
@Kitten_Mittenss I'll send more info through your messages!
@Kitten_Mittenss :) definitely! You can hit up either me or valeria for more info or pictures too if that's the case.
@Kitten_Mittenss it's like Australian Sheperd and jack Russell mixed <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> they look unique. And theyre bigger than chihuahuas, but small. :)
Yo who wants a free puppy. All I ask is for a proper home for him. <PENSIVE FACE>
@JayyyCsogi @_Coronaaaa I really thought she was gonna win most trashiest music of all time. Maybe next year.
I just spent like my last 4 hours on writing music... :) I should really work on homework though. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@PaolaKoallla I guess the East Coast just wants something to brag about since they don't have an In n Out. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@PaolaKoallla That's how I felt tbh. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> Doesn't compare to in n out or canes. lol
@Renikkuhh I've been trying to get a grasp at a lot of music type of stuff lately. :)
@Renikkuhh <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> or I can just be a sound engineer too. lol
@Renikkuhh Jam with me. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
And on another note, I started working out, but I have to stop because school and work lifestyle is back in.
@Vivisuarus did you just quote wiz khalifa.
Oh yeah! On another note. I finally had White Castle. And it doesn't compare to In n Out still. <RELIEVED FACE> in n out definitely has my heart. <HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW><HEART WITH ARROW>
@Vivisuarus Now we can be bffffff's <INFORMATION DESK PERSON> duh
@Vivisuarus hey. :) thas me.
On a side note. Taxes are boring.
Just kidding. Add me on snapchat already. I've been having it for so long with barely any friends. lol @rockzist
But I am team no follow back.
I feel like I don't tweet enough for you guys. But if you'd like, you can always add me on snapchat. <WINKING FACE> it's the same as my twitter name. lol
@JBarrens_ I never met anyone more unluckier than you. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> and you even got an award for it... I'm happy you have you car back though. :)
@Renikkuhh @JebCody chipotle is okay. It's just too expensive for something that could be better quality... xD
Fuck. I'm a dumb ass. I didn't even practice my speech for tomorrow. xD and I literally have no time at all tomorrow... And I'm sleepy.
@RiahEatsHumans true <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@RiahEatsHumans im about to have a long ass day tomorrow, not excited <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL>
@Sullliebby @Joelwillans <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><PISTOL>
@_ChefTia_ xD oh really??? :') I'll say hi next time if I see you.
@_ChefTia_ oh yeah. :) it's English 102. But yeah, are you in a nearby class?
@IBarrens_ <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I've always wanted to visit just to say hi. lol!
@JBarrens_ girls really are lame. That's why I'm gay.
Seeing my doggy makes me happy. :) because he's always so happy.
My dogey dog is so fucking cute. <RELIEVED FACE><HEART WITH ARROW> ily u my raikou. 
But on a brighter note, I like knowing my friends are going to college and/or going to work. :) yay for growing up and responsibility.
I hate reading tweets that are stupid. And finding the comments with stupid replies. I wanna facepalm myself for how stupid people can be.
Despite how much I shop at amazon. The amount of packaging material they use is ridiculous.
@eelezzor <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> were cool. :')
Hey dogs I'm on twitter in class. Yay for night school tbh. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I finally finished my set. :') It just needs a bit more rearranging as of now. And maybe like two more small things. 
Guys. :( Miss Jamaica didn't win Miss Universe. #MissJamaicaShouldHaveWon
My doggy and I have the same hair. :)
@Kimo_the_Great :) Thanks!
My drum set is about to be finished. :') So excited. lol.
What are some good bands to listen to...? That are not slow. Slow bands progress too slow. I just wanna jump into it.
@Vivisuarus but you do have friends :(
@JBarrens_ yes, read my other tweet about you
“@IBarrens_: #DescribeYourSexLifeInABand The Ghost Inside (you)” Neck Deep. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I remind Jon that I care for him. Not because he doesn't know. But because someone needs to constantly remind him for when he feels uncared.
@JBarrens_ imy u already.
So I just bought this vinyl and don't know whether to open it up or to just leave it wrapped. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@JBarrens_ y
@JBarrens_ ok
When you wake up still feeling buzzed. 
Dude, I hade the coolest fucking lunch today. Champion's meal. 
@IBarrens_ hell yeah nigga! If you ain't burning, you ain't earning!
Gym soreness is the best type of soreness. I feel like a noodle now. An entire, single noodle. Ima shower now. A noodle in a shower.
@Staygoldmiles @FunkyGhoe @Shroomin_Ron420 Gio, why the hell are you in every picture I see. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@daviddump what if we threw up without the food. Would we be spitting acid? Don't be on acid, let acid be in you.
@Vivisuarus tru, must suck to be a girl. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><VICTORY HAND>️
@Vivisuarus <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I've always felt bad for the people who could only hang out at school! #NeverAllowedOutsideLife
But it's only even worst coming from someone who couldn't attain what they wanted.
When people have doubt in me whether it's music career or occupational, it only motivates me to prove them wrong.
My girlfriend is gonna be working when I'm not working all week. :( someone hang out with me pls. i have food.
The people at Capriotti's are bad ass. valeria and I got a large philly to be split. And the person labeled each as "his" and "hers". :')
“@reIatablevines: When you take a group picture and hate it. 
@TWFpoppunk oh wait, you have 20k followers. When did that happen.
@TWFpoppunk dude, you guys are truly fucking amazing. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> why the hell isn't this blowing up in the music scene yet. :') glad I'm following.
@JBarrens_ ok
@LighHife I actually always appreciated your middle name. :) I think of Alexis on fire when I here alexis. xD
jon acknowledged me, and I tried playing cool so I didn't scare him away again. But playing cool scared him away. again. oops.
@JBarrens_ hi
I have the room to myself again. And it feels so empty now. I should just put a chair in the middle of the room to top it off.
@LighHife oops. :( I guess it's safe to say I'm an animal.
“@ReallyGoodIdea: 
@dethkock alright :) that'll be perfect too.
@dethkock okay :) I'll see what I can do.
Music for dayz~ :')
You know, I like skating and drawing. But I actually have fun sitting and making music. I can do it for hours. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@dethkock I know. :( I should've hit you up today. Because it's my day off. And I was actually just experimenting with my equipment.
Only tenet has jammed out with me. :) and that was cool while it lasted. @dethkock
It'd be nice to jam session with people. :) so I can learn different perspectives of sound.
It's so much easier to make music when you have the equipment to experiment different types of sound.
@Vivisuarus me and valeria can abduct u :)
@Vivisuarus I'm like down the street. Like all the way down the street on east side and not west side.
@Vivisuarus <SLEEPY FACE> me and my friends can abduct you before you get abducted.
@Vivisuarus you gon die from the cartels :/
I like when Jon acknowledges me and says hi
@JBarrens_ ily u 2 bae
@JBarrens_ I'm excited for you guys :)
As I was exiting my car, I was contemplating to either leave my Capriotti's leftovers in the car or take it to the fridge. xD
@IBarrens_ I still have to get my all my cymbals tbh <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> but I'm getting there :')
@waldo124 it's the other way around. You're glad you don't have a big ego, because you don't think you're attractive. But you sexy af. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@_ChefTia_ True. :) but I mean, I'd rather watch adventure time animations than cat dog animations if I had a choice. xD
I think it's weird when people are like "oh! 90's shows! Yeah man!" But if you really think about it, they were crappy ass hell actually. xD
@ItsStephanee @Juice_Gunzalez I remember every time I witnessed you sad or cry, I'd feel so bad actually. I'm not 100% asshole. Just 95. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Juice_Gunzalez @ItsStephanee I thought it was something more like that. I didn't remember ever helping out stephanee before. :')
@Juice_Gunzalez @ItsStephanee we were? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I don't remember to be honest. We messed around in history hella though.
My little brother is cool, he have me a towel when I was butt naked af.
So at work, we did Secret Santa, and my coworker is basically the best. She got me 3 pairs of socks, 2 gift cards, and 2 red bulls. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEART WITH ARROW>
And now that I have free time... I don't know what to do. :( it's a good thing I have music instruments.
I'm always so busy going to work and school that I come back home ready for the routine again tomorrow.
OKAY. MY WINTER STARTED. Who tryna hang out. I don't care when your available, please make your appointments here.
So who wants to experiment music with me one of these days. I mean my collection of instruments is growing. You can experiment with my stuff
When people think glasses seem so cool to have but not realize they become part of your investment plan. :(
@waldo124 @JebCody being best friends means taking a shit together while holding hands letting each other know the world isn't over yet.
@LighHife I think you look nice.
I'm just a pop punk kid doing pop punk things. -The Story So Wonder Years
@TheBatMere WTF. I SWEAR I ALMOST DOED JUST FROM 1. YOURE CRAZY. :(
@JBarrens_ I did that once and my pee was literally like a neon yellow green <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
So who's tryna help me play the violin now... :(
@ItsStephanee ugh... Psychology... <PENSIVE FACE> I literally need to study an entire class I never learned in.
Alright, so study for exams or listen to Such Gold. :/ hmm...
I really shouldn't eat greasy foods anymore, I swear I break out everytime I do. <PENSIVE FACE> ugh. <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>
@IBarrens_ A mixture of general tools and snap on. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Having a tool box makes me feel more of a man than I already am. Because I own it. With my money. So it's my stuff. Manly stuff. <HAMMER><NUT AND BOLT><WRENCH>
@kingofdemise666 :( dang.
@kingofdemise666 her name is professor Ruth walker xD she sucks at this stuff lol. She just gave us a study guide lol
This is so funny. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> my mom and her sisters are all together. I've never ever seen this happened. :') it's like a family reunion for my mom.
I'm sad. Because I haven't learned one thing from my psychology class, and now I have to study my exam material which covers everything.
I'm neutral. The world is more so or less shit. Just do what's good for yourself and surround yourself with better ideals.
It's the other way around. Open your eyes, the media is only feeding you the most outrageous stuff. Nobody wants to watch about good deeds.
I hate when people say people are blind from the media and don't realize how bad the world is.
Life isn't even hard. People are just lazy.
@McKayleigh I hate you now. ;~;
Well trust me, the struggle is real every time I have to see my family and act like I understand them.
People are always like "how do you communicate with family?!" when they find out my Spanish sucks.
@dethkock :) you inspire me to stay your friend.
My girlfriend is lucky she is dating me. I mean, the things I'd do to me. <RELIEVED FACE><HEART WITH ARROW> she is lucky.
@dethkock True, you can be metal af if you were buff with long hair wearing the head band and 9 string guitar.
I DID BAD ON MY MATH TEST. shit, how am I ever suppose to be an engineer now.
@dethkock change your name Jenner to Kenner. And cut your hair as short as mine and get buff af. Then everyone wants to know u, the new guy.
I wonder why it's funny when I slip in gay jokes. Is this some sort of segregation to gays or something.
True doe, I am gay as fuck.
Dude, how the hell am I breaking out, like nigga, I'm 19 not 12. Nigga I don't even got a beard yet.
@dethkock Out with the ol', in with the new. das how.
My little brother is about to be pimp slapped back into reality. The world isn't full of unicorns and rainbow trails.
DUDE. I was about to go on break and buy Capriotti's. But I checked the lounge before I left. And woulda ya know, FREE CAPRIOTTI'S. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEART WITH ARROW>
@PaolaKoallla paolers is growing up already. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> can you just be little all the time :(
Can I have a study partner. So I don't get bored studying. .~.
Dude Betthoven has really nice hair.
Driving in the rain is cool.
Stops being idiots guys. And that movie that came out. *Facepalm* Nigga can go get out with that movie too.
If you'd like, you can go 100 on the part for math or whatever the hell you need to use it for.
Like no nigga. That's too much ATP going to waste. It's beneficial for our brains NOT to be used 100%.
That's like doing a math problem, but you need to be using the part of the brain responsible for taste as well.
Because we wouldn't. We already used 100% of our brains. It's just that all of it doesn't respond to one thing. Because it's useless.
I feel bad for the people who really think we'd be able to do more things if we used 100% of our brains.
@JBarrens_ I already set a goal to die before 50, so it wouldn't do justice.
@JBarrens_ how do people get married before that. Valeria's gonna have to wait until I'm 35. Nigga on god.
@ItsStephanee take communications with me
@Renikkuhh I swear they do this on purpose. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Chris Cole Killin' It is actually a really good song by Off Trends. Too bad I never hang out with them anyways.
@AsiaVsTheWorld @ScxttShxrp dang Asia, y don't you come on
@AsiaVsTheWorld @ScxttShxrp I was gone two seconds and you guys had an entire conversation without me <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@AsiaVsTheWorld @ScxttShxrp text me ya guys
@AsiaVsTheWorld @ScxttShxrp who's Linda? Did she work at check outs?
@AsiaVsTheWorld I don't even know who goes there anymore. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> maybe I'll stop by tomorrow lol.
@AsiaVsTheWorld I was planning to go today. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> but if was like naw, I hate that place.

@JBarrens_ <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><PISTOL>
Dude, we have like nice tv's in my house but nobody even knows how to use them. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> How does one put on a movie for the guests. Done.

<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm grateful my brother Richard isn't spending thanksgiving with my family this year. *Shots Fired*
@Troyboyyyyyy <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> hahha. That sucks. The things you do for love. *Insert Courage the Cowardly Dog*
I guess I'm a fake ass nigga. smh.
Tbh I was just tryna listen to music and then my friend started talking to me. And I was just like... .~. Oh yeah, hahha...
Always begin before you'd ever prepare never think twice about, nothing will come until you're already there never think twice about it all<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Why is every last song on every Circa Survive album so fucking beautiful for and end. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
Like who cares whether you're right or not. Go do something with your life already.
I'll never understand why people become so revolved around religion. Nor understand why anyone would become strongly atheist.
@JBarrens_ :( but ily

@Mrpoppyseed School, work, and girlfriend. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> haven't seen you in forever dude, how are you?
@Mrpoppyseed Couldn't be said any better way. lol

@JBarrens_ make music, because it feels better, and if people like it, then sweet. And if they don't, well you made music.
@JebCody :') HELL YEAH. lol Thanks to Ivan hahha. @IBarrens_
@JebCody True af <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> that's a bad ass vinyl though.

My mom was talking to my little brother and asking how do you say keep the noise down in English. And I replied "Shut the fuck up." <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JBarrens_ das part of the adventure
And she even bought me 2 pairs of socks from Express. :') she knows how to surprise me when I only got to see her for like 5 minutes. xD
Valeria's the best. :) I work and then go to school and don't have time for food but she brought me enchiladas to eat after I got off class.
@TheBatMere WHAT. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> the tortilla is basically like the utensil itself.
@ItsStephanee who actually doesn't bullshit it though?
Dude! :) I'm so excited I got a B on my 2nd math test! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I'm so happy tbh. Lol! Dude, now I have the potential of still getting an A. :)
Hey guys! :) valeria has been really sad about the dog being gone. so if you could all cheer her up or something, even a tweet. @Sullliebby
The problems of buying video games but never having the time to play it. :'(
So I have Pokemon X or whatever and Yoshi's Island. But I didn't even beat either game yet, but I already want Super Smash. :(
@IBarrens_ THATS WHAT IM SAYING. Fuck Ivan. :') <HEART WITH ARROW>
@IBarrens_ your counterpart <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@Vivisuarus <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> wise words from rocky. <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@Vivisuarus You cool I guess. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I always thought you'd grow up weird like everyone. But you didn't. So that's weird... lol. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><MUSICAL NOTE><MUSICAL SCORE><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@IBarrens_ You still remind me of Michael Bohn from Issues. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> actually, I thought you were Michael Bohn until I read your twitter name. Lol.
@Vivisuarus In that case, you can be the xylophone player. And maybe even throw in some harmony vocals every once in awhile.
@Vivisuarus Actually I suck at guitar. But it's okay, that's why were all forming a band.
@Vivisuarus Join our band. With the Jon, Ivan And Jenner.
@lunelupe Yeah. I just throw my hat on it and call it a day. So glad hats are acceptable in college. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Having a girlfriend is cool, because you can mess with them. And yeah. I guess I already do that with guys though. Since it's acceptable.
@lunelupe Sometimes I'm like, I'll do my hair nicely today. Then it's like. :) were not gonna cooperate. And I'm like fuck you. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@JBarrens_ I'm done. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

I think me and @JBarrens_ might have something going on... <HEART WITH ARROW>
@IBarrens_ should I join :)
@IBarrens_ ok :)
daddy I don't want to be sick and disgusting...
@IBarrens_ YOUVE BEEN UNACTIVATED. And I tried chilling with you eeee-vaaaaan. imy boo.
@JBarrens_ I noticed that after I sent the tweet! HAHHA. I'd feel offended too tbh though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@JBarrens_ It's no wonder, I spell everything wrong. That's why you write the lyrics in the band.
@JBarrens_ Jonathan Stephens. Okay. I'm excited.
@JBarrens_ John, can we make heavy music
@jiujitsuboyy Open the pits
@Brittballs_ Hint Hint: start listening to Beartooth
@jiujitsuboyy And then you can make a band called Hawktalon and could start screaming just like him. <RELIEVED FACE>
@jiujitsuboyy looks like Caleb Shomo from Beartooth.

@JBarrens_ then hang out with me :(
If you see this ugly ass nigga, please notify me or @Sullliebby. It was last seen around Alexander and Simmons. 
Oh and Jeb lied to me. I'm actually digging Brand New's Déjà Entendu album more than Daisy or the other long one. Maybe I'm weird...
So I just started to listening to Beartooth. I guess I'm on the bandwagon. But it'd be a shame if I never listened to them. So... <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@dyanabanana_ Oh nevermind. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> my major is literally only math classes. Engineering. <SLEEPY FACE>
@dyanabanana_ but don't you only need like 2 math classes until you can jump into calculus?
@dyanabanana_ wtf is this <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I wish my math class was this! LOL.
I've worried so much about what happened. I forgot that this is all I am. So I'll take my stand then. Because this is all I'll ever be.
@JBarrens_ band practice.
@DerrickTheRaddd @FunkyGhoe I always get mixed up whether it's the 31st of October, or the 1st of November. I hate your birthday. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><PARTY POPPER><WRAPPED PRESENT><WINE GLASS><BEER MUG>
@JBarrens_ Fuck them fuck bois.
I was watching this movie and the nigga said there must be a mathematical equation for how ugly that tie is. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I just want to get to the part of math where nobody understands me in numbers. And if I really think about it, I don't even understand me.
@JBarrens_ At least you have something to talk about right? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Anything worth striving for.
@jeremys702 of coarse! <HEART WITH ARROW>
@jeremys702 True. xD I guess it's really all preference.
@jeremys702 Make sure you're confident with your decision! Because waiting until fall and summer is awhile. xD and I hated the wait. lol
@ScottSharpiee Fight me then Scott right here right now <FISTED HAND SIGN><FISTED HAND SIGN>
I didn't want tin can next to my car, so I made sure there was hella space in between us. 
I'm kind of glad homework has been stressing me to the point that I stay up late then wake up for work early.
DUDE. I GOT TO EXPERIENCE LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL FOR FREE. <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE> Thank you Paolers for the snapchats. @PaolaKoallla
@JBarrens_ :( I feel so bad because you're a nice guy. And you don't deserve this. I'm sorry Jon.
On a brighter note; I was at this clinic for a tb test and the guy stuck the needle in my arm and was digging around. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I was laughing hard.
I just wanna play music now.
I hate having classes I don't care about.
@LighHife My life at Kmart. But it was worth leaving.
@LighHife When is it even?
Dude. My alarm clocks are metal. But I went to sleep listening to metal. So I was struggling to determine the difference when I was waking.
@AsiaVsTheWorld Oh really? xD I would have too, I'd be like the heck is Amanda Bynes doing here, like oh shit?!?! I need an autograph!1!!11
@AsiaVsTheWorld A lot of people have left the place! xD It's awkward going inside kmart now. Knowing that it's different people.
The only really cool thing I like about work, is that random companies bring us free food because we're a fucking clinic. :')
@AsiaVsTheWorld we all...? xD who's all? I only party with with me, myself, and I...
@AsiaVsTheWorld competing? xD is that even a real thing? Society disappoints me. Guys are weird too.
@waldo124 I'm Fucking Done. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@LighHife Go to school. Get more mula. Then make music.
@_ChefTia_ I greatly dislike how happy and ugly my dog gets. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> He needs to learn how to just chill. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Is that how I became a bad ass? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> because I can actually hang out with all types of crowds? lol
I feel like people mess up when they try to fit in. But then they mess up when they be themselves. Ya gotta find a balance. #homeostasis
I feel like my self confidence has been decreasing lately. But then I'm like, who am I impressing, I don't hang out with anybody. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I used to live by the motto, "If it ain't metal, it ain't shit." Then I started listening to Classical Music. #transitiontuesday
@JBarrens_ Because there's only one of you. And 80 Jons.
@JBarrens_ I'm not kidding though Jonathan Stevens. You have potential. And that's what I need.
@JBarrens_ No. <PENSIVE FACE> I was always being serious. Our band will crumble if it's just me. I need you. <FISTED HAND SIGN><RAISED FIST><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><TWO MEN HOLDING HANDS>
J-Ron Smith, also known as The Grape Drank is now in my band.
@JBarrens_ Why would I not be serious about music? I guess my working drum set and 4 guitars don't mean anything.
@Grap3Drank <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><RELIEVED FACE><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ ok
@JBarrens_ did you at least write lyrics
@JBarrens_ come play music with me band mate, I've been writing music all day
@dethkock That one is cool. :) No Nurture is pretty cool too. Then again, most are really good. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_scoutLA definitely should make more stuff dude!
@dethkock Its funny because I already had the lyrics inserted onto my iPod. xD cause I was like, 'this is gonna be great' then I put it off.
@dethkock I checked out a lot like birds No Place album and actually read their lyrics. :') and it was beautiful tbh.
@dyanabanana_ the art style and concept just totally grabs my attention :) it's like a must watch for me lol.
@dyanabanana_ I'm so jealous :( if I don't watch it tomorrow with valeria, I'm watching it alone period.
@dyanabanana_ It already came out? :(
On a better note, I'm celebrating my night with macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets.
Except my major ain't even science. It's engineering. Touché.
Where's my dose of science. I need that chemistry and biology.
I don't like psychology class anymore. Psychology is boring. It ain't even learning the biological part of the brain. Just concepts. Boring.
@dethkock <PENSIVE FACE> I lost a lot of muscle though pls jenner, I need to get in shape again lol
@dethkock <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> it's cause I look 12 and people like 12 year olds and everybody is a pedophile <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL>

Mondays are weird days. I go to school, then work, then school again. Then to sleep.
Jon Stephens and I started a pop punk band and he's writing the lyrics/vocals. I'm doing everything else. @JBarrens_
John Cody gave us food at work. :) He's a fucking bad ass obviously. Now how does one repay someone for such awesomeness? @JohnCodyyy
Come party with me then jon. I see your favorite.
I'm so bored, nobodies awake. I wanna do something, but I know I should be doing homework. Maybe I should skate to feel alive again.
Party with me Jenner. And check out my ride. :) hang out with me Saturday.
I feel like I make friends easily tbh. I don't even try, and yet somehow, people are interested in me.
Who's trying to party on Saturday? I got invited to a friend's party and I don't wanna be alone. <PENSIVE FACE>
@ItsStephanee Yeah, but does your girlfriend work at Taco Bell?
@Brittballs_ You can queer around as long as those grades are good. <OK HAND SIGN>
@IBarrens_ I will use this to my advantage
@IBarrens_ I think we'll hang out soon though. My schedule's been more flexible lately. :) except I'm not sure how your schedule is...

@JebCody This is all I want everyday of my life, and then I regret it.
@FoliaJean True. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JBarrens_ I'm being serious. And Waldo can help by making the best bacon you've ever had. @waldo124
I feel like a lot of people lack communication skills. And not just talking, but I mean talking about the right things at the right time.
@JBarrens_ Me neither, I'll cook you a meal Saturday morning, does that count?
I always feel accomplished when I do a math problem and get it right the first try. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I must be doing something right...
@Renikkuhh Cause niggas got size 17.
@eelezzor become a guy. :)
@eelezzor better for you...?

My car looks mighty fine for a typical school day though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> 
Damn I'm too tired too function. I couldn't even party if I could. <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
@Brittballs_ @waldo124 And that's why I'm gay. Natures Condom.
@shiiitfacee I know! The kid was lucky the driver was helping him out. If that was me, I'd get him up and be like "now pay for it nigga." <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Kid deserved it. He ran himself into it. Idiot. No sympathy for you. It's assholes like you as to why the driver probably gets blamed.
I witness a kid on a bike get hit by a car at a school zone. Honestly, my reaction was, what the heck why are you crossing without looking?
Who can I spend Halloween with...? my girlfriend is gonna be working, and I'll be alone. :(
I'm reading about how the new iPhone bends... xD and let's be honest, if you're spending $1,000 on a piece of crap, it better not bend. lol
Is this why the thots approach me tbh.
I feel like my face looks mad all the time. Even when I'm not trying...
@jasminime uhm, maybe if more people played it, they'd understand why
@jasminime ANIMAL CROSSING. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@kingofdemise666 Damn dude. :( that's my paycheck right there! lol. Not really, but that is hella gas. Mines like less than half. xD crap.
@trapdadddy Set myself on a contract... xD The payments and the insurance is affordable for me so it's not so bad. :)
@kingofdemise666 Fuck dude. :( You're crazy. Damn, I could imagine how much gas it kills. :(
@trapdadddy it's a 2014 Nissan Sentra. :) sorry dude, I didn't realize I got these notifications until I looked back at my tweets xD
@kingofdemise666 oh it's a 2014 Nissan Sentra xD I mean as long as it's affordable and new. :)
@EnjoiDeezNutz24 basically :)
It's my little brother's birthday today and now he's 17. :) I am so happy for him. He deserves to enjoy his life. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Troyboyyyyyy Fuck. :( Stupid drivers. I don't wanna drive no more.
@_selenelopez oh yeah, she isn't even related to me... I forgot. .~.
Is your little sister as cool as mine? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Brittballs_ This is me not giving a shit about your reply. :)
@JBarrens_ except i like reading your tweets. :( they keep me entertained. Tweets coming from you let me know you still exist.
Tbh 
If anybody wants my schedule, I'm free on the weekends. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Party it up on Saturdays. Repent on Sundays.
I have a new car now.
@dyanabanana_ :') That's how I felt tbh
@dyanabanana_ OMG IM SO EXCITED FOR THE BOOK OF LIFE. :))))) I need to see it. The style is so artistically beautiful looking. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

Oh wait, its been so long I forgot how we…
@Juice_Gunzalez I'm just kidding. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Hahha! imagine? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Juice_Gunzalez :) Did I just downgrade from brother to cousin?
@Juice_Gunzalez To make music. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
What food do I surprise a girl with? And it can't be candy, because were both hungry. lol
@waldo124 @JohnCodyyy shit was not fun <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@JohnCodyyy I said the same thing until one day; something really freaky happened. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@JohnCodyyy I'm sorry. :(
@JohnCodyyy It's probably haunted. Because my house is haunted. So I probably brought spirits to your house that are finally awaking.
@Kitten_Mittenss I always hug a pillow when I sleep <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I see Alex at school tbh. @LighHife Where the rest at?
After you finish homework, and know you should study. But damn, I just finished homework...
@JebCody Not with me. Anything was a good conversation with us.
I used to spend everyday worrying what I will do and who will I hang out with. Now I just work, go to school, and if I'm lucky, see my boo.
It's officially been over a year since I've asked out valeria. How did a year already pass?
I hate people who settle in with potential problems. Oh, it's not a problem. Then BAM. Then you ask why life's so hard on you.
@JBarrens_ @waldo124 <PENSIVE FACE> it's okay, I'll be going to the gym again soon, and I'll be rocky again.
@ItsStephanee Why? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JBarrens_ @waldo124 But I'm a little bitch. And Gay.
@IBarrens_ Dis my life. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><BEATING HEART><TWO HEARTS>
@IBarrens_ Hopefully! :) Forget the mini van, it's about driving pedovans! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> (Aka what I drive when valeria let's me borrow it)
@IBarrens_ Man that's still lame though. :( I'm sorry ivan you have to go through this.
@IBarrens_ Fuck. :( I wish I had a car and I'd pick you up and take you.
Tbh, one point of life, were all gonna get older and look ugly as shit. So I'll be sure to die before then. -Circa Survive
@Brittballs_ The name of the dog is so bad ass tbh. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Allistair_488 I'm gay though. God does not accept me.
I've come to terms with me and my offensive remarks. But yenno. What can you do.
I'm just kidding. I'm not a faggot ass queer. Religion is overrated. Go to a science class already.
I'm trying to form a religious club for thy holy savior. Religion is so fun. The concept of god is amazing. I wish people knew god was real.
Who's gonna be at the CSN Cheyenne campus from 5pm and on?
@_Coronaaaa <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL> farts can never be qute when it's killing you.
@IBarrens_ I'm always down for anything involving music.
@IBarrens_ let's have a jam session some time in the future too :)
I wanna sleep, but I have class at 6, and then when I'm done, I have to take the bus home and do homework. :( can I sleep yet.
@Renikkuhh Happy Birthday boy! I remember when you were just a lil niglet, now here you are. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Brittballs_ xD it's so funny! hahha!
I spent like 5 dollars on a damn small sandwich. Damn. But it was totally worth it when you're hungry. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> I'd like to say it hit the spot.
Nigga hella just "K"'d me via text for group project. No reply for you ya bish. <SMIRKING FACE><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><RAISED HAND>
when Mexicans say 'thank you for call me." true xD
@JBarrens_ you misspelled yes
@JBarrens_ make music
Just because they're on your side doesn't mean you'll be right. You manifest your actions with the potential of proving everyone wrong.
Except I'm like, "Don't ever give a guy a handjob; chances are, he knows how to do it better himself, than you do."
Most people treat their little sisters like "Don't associate with guys. Don't think of them, Don't have sex with them, Not even a hand job."
Hello, my name is rocky. I think we'll become close friends. And then I will shut you off. Because that's the kind of stupid shit I do.
@_scoutLA that shit looks so bomb <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE>
@AsiaVsTheWorld No, this is Patrick.
@AsiaVsTheWorld I eat dogs for a living.
@IBarrens_ :( okay, I'll hit you up on the dms then
@IBarrens_ is your number still 702-439-9017?
Being in college is weird. But meeting new people is cool. Except I wanna interact with everyone else I've met then and see how's life.
@RingMyDingaLing <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><WHITE SMILING FACE>️<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><WHITE SMILING FACE>️ you guys are so cute, I mean... cough cough. Cool.
@Troyboyyyyyy it really irritates me when people would try and prove god. Like lol what are you even saying.
Star Wars Episode III was probably the best movie of the series.
The only flaws to my days are that I sleep late at night, but wake up early in the morning.
@CharmingMann I just realized I thought you had Andrew for a class, but my brother Tommy said some chick was like "do you know rocky" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CharmingMann You always have the awkwardest things to say. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> it's why we became friends. :)
I'm doing a group project that's based on one chapter, and I feel like I'm putting way too much on something that'll fly by fast... xD
@eelezzor This. This is my life. Besides English and History. What I look like mastering those.
@_ChefTia_ Yeah. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> But it's not too bad, she sleeps late anyways. I just can't wait for the weekend to begin lol :)
I'm here at school doing nothing. Waiting for valeria. Except I have like 3 hours to kill now.
This chick hella just walked into the window glass thinking it was a door. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> And I witnessed it right in front of her. Ouch. Hahha!
@AsiaVsTheWorld Stop taking selfies and go learn some logarithm or exponential growth.
@AsiaVsTheWorld no I don't follow you, but now I do <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@AsiaVsTheWorld wait who are you again? you're Amanda Bynes right? Idunno who I follow <PENSIVE FACE> is it the same name as your twitter?
@AsiaVsTheWorld does that make me good then? or did all the good ones leave before me? :( follow me on Instagram butt head.
@AsiaVsTheWorld :( Imy too! Actually I don't work at Kmart! xD There goes the crew, oops. Lol. I abandoned them. Cause school and new job.
@AsiaVsTheWorld <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> Just a friendly reminder to the world that cocky, loser guys can like math.
Dude math is so cool sometimes. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Because it's basically just a language in numbers and everything goes together, it's almost crazy. lol
I feel like school is pretty cool and the homework ain't even that bad... <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I hella just saw a dragonfly chilling on the sidewalk on my way home from the bus stop. He didn't wanna fly any more. He tired of life too.
@CharmingMann Except our personalities are nothing alike! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@CharmingMann Do you really?! xD That's so funny. He also has stephanee parent for a class lol.
@Renikkuhh Dude, I literally put a lock on my closet door xD
Would you rather have had everything at one point and then to lose it all? Or to never have had anything in the first place?
@MerchMane it's when everyone gets out the car on a red light and switch seats so that there's a new driver.
@jaybecray me and you
@jaybecray me
@lunelupe True! :) lol. How are you doing butthead? I've been good, good.
@lunelupe <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> and I just kinda go along... It'd be embarrassing if I just said "oh and I'm a guy" and the awkwardness over the phone. hahha!
@AndrewG702 <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> Hopefully. Lol!
@AndrewG702 This is my life <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Lately I haven't been hungry much... As if I already don't eat enough. <PENSIVE FACE>
@ItsStephanee is that Hozie?
@jiujitsuboyy @JBarrens_ It probably is. I hate kids. They take commitment. Tf I look like. <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
@jiujitsuboyy @JBarrens_ My kid says wrestlings for chumps
@JBarrens_ You flushed your kids down Jesse's toilet :(
@JBarrens_ I flush my kids away most times, so this ones not too different...
@JBarrens_ Not before I kill mine ok.
@JBarrens_ I want a son that beats up your kid
@RiahEatsHumans @rloyo_ @SammyWammyyyyy @shannonhunn :) valeria can join your club, lol @Sullliebby
@RiahEatsHumans @rloyo_ @SammyWammyyyyy @shannonhunn <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> oh my god, tell me why it really feels like that, driving is so easy though! Lol!
@ItsStephanee oh crap, that's actually really crazy... Well I wish you the best of luck. :)
@ItsStephanee I'm just kidding. :) what are you tryna major in?
@ItsStephanee Since when was school a priority. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><OK HAND SIGN>
@_ChefTia_ but the teacher sucks tbh, he flies through the chapters :( so any class can be hard if the teacher sucks <PENSIVE FACE>
@_ChefTia_ oh i have Pre Cal 1 xD or math 126
Dude that math class was intense as fuck. Now who wants to give me a ride home xD
@EnjoiDeezNutz24 Yeah dude. :) keep it up! <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Yeah! Turn on my right hand! THATS MY TROPE!<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@JebCody I'm sorry Jebbers. :( I wish you had a better job. Or at least a funner environment.
@EnjoiDeezNutz24 It's actually pretty awesome that only you wanna be actually. :) It makes you stick out.
@waldo124 @JohnCodyyy I don't hate Cheyenne, but I know sure as hell that I don't miss it after graduating. xD
I think it's cool when people say "How'd you land this job?" And I'm just like... to be honest Idunno... I just got really lucky... xD
Tbh class just started for valeria... xD so I have an hour and thirty minutes before mine starts.
I was excited for my math class this semester tbh, but my teacher apparently sucks <PENSIVE FACE> I'm gonna struggle cause this nigga
@ItsStephanee <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Get at school early and bring me food at the entrance. Lol the west entrance.
@ItsStephanee I took the bus here :( because no car lol, I'm going to math class, I think it's math 121
@ItsStephanee I'm at the Cheyenne campus now tbh xD
NIGGGAS GOT FREE WIFI AT CSN. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> this place is gold. Lol
@dethkock well I wish you luck then dude :) and you're the best, I'm excited!
@dethkock wait, of next week? :) I think kmart is always hiring tbh xD cause people always come and go, and I'm just like true
@JohnCodyyy "My life in a nutshell." -John Cody :)
@dethkock when do you get back? :) you're way too awesome Jenner, hey I left kmart! So Ima be free Sundays and Saturdays <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JohnCodyyy oh okay, as long as the drum set went into good hands <RELIEVED FACE> phew... I need to see you before you leave john ;~;
@dethkock If you do Jenner, I'll literally fucking love you so much <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><BEATING HEART><TWO HEARTS><REVOLVING HEARTS><BEATING HEART><HEART WITH ARROW> but if not, it's ok, the thought counts :)
@JohnCodyyy what the fuck? :( sad face. When are you leaving?
@dethkock but it has to be good! x) it's king taco! lol, but then again it needs to be refrigerated <PENSIVE FACE>
@EnjoiDeezNutz24 @Troyboyyyyyy @ItsStephanee me and valeria are going to Cheyenne and Charleston :(
@dethkock get me some king taco, in fact, get me a burrito el pastor, and come back to vegas and give me it and I will give you 10 dollars
@RingMyDingaLing @Renikkuhh The first minute I saw this, I was like true, then I was like wait... Is that Xavier...? xD True! lol
Tbh can't get into Indie or Alt music as much, they try way too hard or they're way too soft, step up your game. Get original.
@ItsStephanee <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I just knew it, because teal is my favorite color, so it's everyone's favorite color too
@ItsStephanee Teal.
@JebCody I wish I was your girl then <PENSIVE FACE> I'm so jealous of girls being able to take these opportunities I have zero chance for
So loud you needa calm down on that bomb stress. .~.
I hate when a person can't here me over the phone, so they start saying what louder, and I'm like, you're so loud. o.0
Damn, so summer break is like ending for y'all niggas, but to me it just feels like time is flying by and seasons are changing.
@Staygoldmiles I work at a clinic place now. :) It's better pay and school is coming around, so it's just best for me at the moment.
I'm so glad I'm basically leaving kmart. lol but I mean the coworkers are probably the reason I'll miss it. Then again, Christmas is coming.
@Staygoldmiles But it's okay, cause I don't care and im leaving that place anyways xD
@Staygoldmiles This is my life basically. And they never tell me anything at my job... lol
Music is an art. Then again, art is an art. Art is cool.
These people think I sound like a girl on the phone sometimes and call me "ma'am" because of my soft voice over the phone. :(
Somebody was trying to log into my twitter account... .~.
@JBarrens_ it says counterparts :( that was way too easy
@IBarrens_ @JBarrens_ Straight Edge X
@JohnCodyyy I'd really like that. :)
@JebCody @JohnCodyyy No. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I would never have been able to guess that! That's actually really crazy.
@JohnCodyyy @waldo124 @JebCody @Greyson_Anatomy Pshh, I got autographs on mine. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I need you're guys new stuff though!
I feel like for every year so far in my life, each one has been different. And I know it'll continue to be different as time passes.
I know I can be weird sometimes tbh, but I'm also part ass hole, so it balances out.
@JebCody Definitely save me a flag and ep pls :)
@DerrickTheRaddd wait, this picture isn't me
@ItsStephanee *24 hours later* "It didn't even work, what a waste of time"
@Kinky_grandma <BEATING HEART><TWO HEARTS><HEART WITH ARROW>
@InjectingMarys it was me
@IBarrens_ well I'm right here :) even if I'm at work 25/7 <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I'll still try to linger around.
@IBarrens_ Sometimes you just gotta throw away concepts for the time being and enjoy where you're already at. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@FunkyGhoe @AsiaVsTheWorld oh yeah , I lie a lot too tbh
@AsiaVsTheWorld oh I cut my hair a few months ago, my picture is outdated, cause my hair is a centimeter long now
@AsiaVsTheWorld I thought I was already <PENSIVE FACE> now my life is a lie
@AsiaVsTheWorld keep them in your closet, because it's hard to be all of them :(
I hate when older people than you by a bit are like "get your shit together and don't fuck up like I did" like nigga, you still have time.
I can't wait to go to school again so I can just feel like I'm going to school and that I actually never really graduated yet.
@ScottSharpiee you left me for boston ;~;
@JebCody @theresidenceca I'm so proud of you guys :)
@jasminime <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> ima be dead tomorrow in the morning because of animal crossing lol
@jasminime as odd as it seems, I was just thinking about playing animal crossing, but I should just sleep instead tbh
@waldo124 Every time I see a tweet from you, I can't help myself from wanting to tweet you back. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> Waldo, keep being yourself, you rock pls.
Why does King Taco not exist in Las Vegas, this bums me out.
@AsiaVsTheWorld @InjectingMarys xD It was meant to be hella lame though, I'm glad you liked it. :')
@AsiaVsTheWorld @InjectingMarys you're a man duh, bynes.
@AsiaVsTheWorld @InjectingMarys That was like the 3rd grade though, I've become a man since then
@AsiaVsTheWorld @InjectingMarys but you're Amanda Bynes
@InjectingMarys Shit, I can't even play volleyball :(
@JBarrens_ word dawg <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> tbh I wouldn't mind any of my friends playing my instruments though, even if you didn't know how
Pretty soon, I'm gonna have a studio of instruments, but nobody to play them with.
I'm such a lame person. I work 25/7 and when I get free time, I don't even know what to do. .~.
Tiny dots on an endless timeline. <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I'm still not sure which puppy I should eat though...
My dog is having puppies rn as we speak tbh
@waldo124 That's the reality of it unfortunately... :( but it's ok, because I still think you're cute.
@WinterIstComing hey Evan, when is your birthday?
@Vivisuarus 2 'shae
@Vivisuarus you a thot
@Vivisuarus I'm team #dontfollowback
@InjectingMarys @PaolaKoallla Mines gonna be like Tuesday, then another the following Saturday <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> the shits great
That's like being known for something you genuinely don't give a shit about.
People who wish to be famous in the music industry just to be famous are stupid. Like what was the purpose of the music then?
I'm glad everybody is doing something in life. It makes me happy. :) keep being you guys.
You guys didn't post out picture on Instagram. :'( was that magic trick for nothing? @hearttoheartCA
@sidnibrown @LighHife I remember when Marco was like, it's just down the street xD and it was just down the street, like 8 hours down. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@Juice_Gunzalez @ItsStephanee For like two days.
@JebCody because I like your lyrics and you really do have a nice shining voice deep inside. :) and obviously, you're better at guitar xD
I want to record music, and I want to feature Waldo in one of my songs. Same with Jeb too. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> @waldo124 @JebCody
More space in my room. :)))) Need more musical equipment.
It's weird to think life is moving really fast. At least when you're constantly doing something. You become distracted from time.
It's weird to think that it felt like being in the band was just yesterday, but pretty soon, it'll be a year since I left. o.0
I'm happy for Off Trends. :) so much potential. @WTFisofftrends
Except it's weird, because I think my friends and coworkers are two totally different worlds of people. o.0
Dude, my coworkers are some of the coolest people I know. <RELIEVED FACE><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@InjectingMarys @LighHife @Kitten_Mittenss I still think regardless of the scenario, books take too much time to read. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #readingcanwait
@InjectingMarys I'm just teasing. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I think it's funny how everybody replied to you though. lolol! xD :)
@InjectingMarys I thought you've met valeria before. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I hate my brother for thinking his life sucks. Like what are you conceited, it's not 'your life', it's life, you just take part in it.
@TheBatMere is his name Kyle Vaught? cause he just favorited one of my tweets about being pop punk. xD
I feel so pop punk right now. :) there are just some days I feel more pop punk than ever.
@JBarrens_ Exactly. I mean you mine as well ban cars because of a couple unstable drivers. People don't even think a situation through.
@JBarrens_ It's really stupid when people say guns should be banned. Like there really is no valid reason as to why they should be banned.
@JebCody I believe you'll grow up to be an amazing musician Jebbers. :) Please keep being you and do not give up, for me.
@InjectingMarys I'm probably late at replying, but you can have a Wells Fargo account and then transfer your money onto it, then drop boa.xD
If you haven't checked out Off Trends new song, then you guys are totally missing out. :) @WTFisofftrends
So keep your head up kid! You're not alone anymore! I swear we'll find something to even out the score! <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> Off Trends is so pop punk. :)
Dude, my dog was hella jamming to The Story So Far. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Get on that shit.
@InjectingMarys @philosiLion I've never had any problems with wellsfargo.
@waldo124 Me too. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I miss drives to nowhere and then eating together off the value menu.
Most importantly, I've been blessed with a girl who likes me And she deserves recognition for being the best I could ever have. @Sullliebby
I have a job and make money. Being able to make money to buy musical equipment. I should be more grateful of what I have. :)
I'd like to say I enjoy my life. I have some of the coolest friends ever, even if I don't get to see most of them often. :)
If I could change one thing, it'd be to spend time differently with certain people who would still acknowledge me now.
@JohnCodyyy Count down to 12am. No excuses. I'm waiting.
@waldo124 @djentjesus valeria says it'll get shit down
@waldo124 @djentjesus that's all I ever want to do <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE>
@waldo124 @djentjesus it's not a pizza place unless it's a venue too.
A day with just me and the guitar. <RELIEVED FACE> These days I feel relaxed and content.
@IBarrens_ nigga, shower in the dark, how'd you think the africans did it?
I feel like I gave up a good portion of my life away. Except I still manage to be myself. I guess that's what counts, right?
I really want In 'n Out. <PENSIVE FACE> but I should just shower and go to bed so I can wake up and work the next day...
@THEJEWISHKING @JebCody :') Free food rocks. They need to run out of ketchup more often.
@JebCody @THEJEWISHKING then you could let me keep it.
@JebCody @THEJEWISHKING Duude! You shoulda been like "no ketchup? I better get all the canes sauce I want for free"
@waldo124 Not even! xD All I did was do my work. You're so talented in music and computers and recording and skating. :) I envy you.
I like Waldo because he's just awesome. :) He's funny, he's in a band, and he skates. He's the dream guy. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I like Jeb because he listens to a lot of music. :) Like you have people who listen to a few hundred, then you have Jeb. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@JohnCodyyy I've noticed you, but I'm not a girl... <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Now I'm done trying to be, a decent human being since you were never one to me<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><RELIEVED FACE><HEADPHONE>
Fake! Fake! You Liar! Adding fuel to this fire! That's been raging in my soul since I was seven years old!
I'll never stop singing this song! Until you're buried in the ground where you belong!
@Kitten_Mittenss @waldo124 He's right here.
I think a lot of my friends are good looking too though. <SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE> and by friends, I do mean the guys of coarse.
Some days, I'm just like ew, don't look at me. Then other days, I'm like <SMIRKING FACE> dayum good looking.
@FunkyGhoe I know it sucks... :( I basically clean cars in the morning and then go close at Kmart. So I don't have much time.
@FunkyGhoe My next day off won't be until Thursday, and basically Friday too. :)
@FunkyGhoe I know, I just disappeared from the face of the earth. ;~; but I come to check in every once in awhile. I got a new phone too!
@LighHife @JebCody I second that! Really good quality and good stuff. :)
I FINALLY HAVE A PHONE AGAIN. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> who tryna hmu now? I need to give everyone my number that nobody got yet though
I like Neck Deep. Except my last tweet was TSSF. I can't wait to see Neck Deep at Warped though. <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE>
And to think that you're somebody's daughter
Away at college not getting smarter~<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@JebCody We've already done that. What haven't we slept to yet is the real question.
@JBarrens_ Damn, looking hella sexy Jon. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Before indie was cool, I would tell people I listened to it, and always got the same response. "What's indie? Is that like indian music?"
@jiujitsuboyy Deathcardboys? xD
This distortion pedal. I'm in love.
<RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><BEATING HEART><TWO HEARTS><BEATING HEART>
@JohnCodyyy Holy shit. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> But Wells Fargo is still where it's at.
@Renikkuhh David is pop punk. He needs pizza.
@djentjesus :) it's one of those things that has potential for later use.
@djentjesus I waste my money on crap I don't have time for. Buying more musical equipment I'll never get to touch.
It's weird to think some people text multiple people, like I can only commit to one person. And that's my mom.
I give props to everybody who danced at prom. :)
Xavier is so funny for yesterday. :') They announced prom princess and Xavier was like "I fucking hate that bitch" and then started crying.
Wow valeria is so cool actually #facts
@_Coronaaaa It actually looks really nice, maybe I could be your friend again.
@Tuuuuuupac who is this little cat <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> first Sabian, now this cat
@waldo124 @JohnCodyyy But I'd save you. <SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
@waldo124 @JohnCodyyy God won't save her! Looking ass.
@waldo124 <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> No.
Work, sleep, repeat. That's all it ever is. And I probably can't afford to do that.
@shiiitfacee Happy birthday Genesis! :) you are older now, yayyaya~
@JebCody @Sullliebby Yay for visiting! :) it was nice see you guys as well.
I think Jeb is the only person I've shared interest in many different bands before we even met. @JebCody
@PaolaKoallla I've been waiting on my dress too <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@djentjesus @melanyloveer @_Coronaaaa idunno, I think it's like in east side...?
@djentjesus @melanyloveer @_Coronaaaa it's because the credit card incident, and they lost hella money and they had to close 2 stores down.
@InjectingMarys Dude the same thing is happening with me. :(
@InjectingMarys I'll have to dm you more info later. :) #nophonegang
@InjectingMarys I'm not too sure... I probably have to ask my manager to see what's up. I'll go check to even see if they have them online.
@InjectingMarys It's your perfect chance to learn then duude. :)
@InjectingMarys Alright, that sounds like death... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> I'd kill me. Well if you want, I can try to put in a word for you maybe?
@InjectingMarys I guess Kmart would be an indoor loser job. ;~; except I like the environment, the store is big, and the employees are cool.
@InjectingMarys I want to experience jobs like this :) just to do it, then get out if it and try something else. Lol
I like having money cause I know it's there when I need it. But it's also a tease knowing I shouldn't spend it. <PENSIVE FACE>
When you go from a home, You take all that you own but the memories echo.
La Dispute's Wildlife album is just simply fucking amazing. Like every song, every second is pure art. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><RELIEVED FACE><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@_Coronaaaa Isn't that what I've been telling you? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@InjectingMarys My life was gnar, then I started being a loser. oops.
If nobody wants to kick it, I'll just skate Cranch on a Friday night by myself again. ;~; but that's ok.
Who tryna kick it tomorrow? :) I don't have a phone, so this is me using twitter to hit you guys up.
@shiiitfacee The police can be like, "did you know why we pulled you over" and I can reply "because I wouldn't let that driver pass me" :')
@shiiitfacee It's so funny though! xD And they can't be mad, because they're breaking the law anyway.
Don't you ever just drive and a car is about to pass you up, but you start speeding so they don't. #moredriverproblems
@JohnCodyyy Plot twist with a turn of events: the other driver was Waldo. ;~;
@JohnCodyyy Even Bigger Plot Twist: The car you were following just took you to his home to rape you.
Do you ever feel guilty passing a yellow light, then see the car in your rearview mirror pass it too and feel less guilty. #drivingproblems
Do you ever just drive and pretend to follow another car just to freak them out, then go a totally different direction? :) #drivingproblems
@Sullliebby The gift of satisfaction. <SMIRKING FACE>
@AngelicaPosts_ I'll keep you posted with information. :)
@djentjesus to be honest, Kmart is probably isn't the best paying too. xD but you get so much different job experience I'd say. :)
@djentjesus It probably does, idunno. xD our store is desperate for associates atm though.
@deathcardboyz @djentjesus No problem duude. :) And i think it'd be cool.
@djentjesus Definitely! :) And I don't think hair will be too much of an issue. But I'll make sure.
@deathcardboyz @djentjesus And they need buff people too. :) I'll talk to my manager for you guys. And get more info.
@djentjesus I can really do it. :) we need associates. I'll let my manager know what's up and get more info.
Does anybody want a job. To work with me. At Kmart. As a straightener. A person who straightens the god damn floor. xD I can put in a word.
@Troyboyyyyyy :) oh, lol. Let me know if you come across it.
@Troyboyyyyyy I've only heard people say emojis o.0 there's another name???
@DeathcardBoyzz you're my eye candy in the pit <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><SMIRKING FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
@InjectingMarys Regardless of the situation, just seeing tweets like "fuck the haters" is just as ridiculous.
@waldo124 I just sorta wish everybody was cool with each other before we all took different routes.
I like Waldo, but I like Marco too. I guess I'm just gay.
@shiiitfacee Hahha! Right? :) That'd be so funny actually if I saw you drive by. well it was nice talking to you genesis!
@shiiitfacee it's because I'm a butt head too. :'( lol, one of these days I'll cross paths with you again... eventually. xD
@shiiitfacee I haven't seen you in forever butt head. Anyways, hi! <WAVING HAND SIGN><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@deathcardboyz I guess you can say that was a real Ba-Ha Blast.
@shiiitfacee My life in one sentence. Like how are these people even on the roads??? .~.
“@LmaoSoFunny: Using your cat as a weapon... 
@JebCody or we could skate together :)
I hate working all the time, except I feel like I have nothing to do when I'm not working. The contradiction. This is life.
@AsiaVsTheWorld I mean, at least you looked healthy, right? <SLEEPY FACE>
@AsiaVsTheWorld Scott said it first to me, and I guess I just got it around the store. "Wow Amanda Bynes, you look so healthy. :')" <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@AsiaVsTheWorld @InjectingMarys okay... ;~;
@AsiaVsTheWorld @InjectingMarys Ching Chong.

@LighHife xD why is this so funny to me, hahhahahhahah
I compliment guys a lot. Either I'm sassy, or every guy is serious.
I dedicate this tweet to Marco. Because I see you on twitter and your twitcon looks nice. And why am I so gay. ;~;
@therettes You're so Pop Punk.
@_Coronaaaa I can just give you a ride but idunno if you're home yet
@JebCody I'll paint you one.
@daviddump yay for neck deep :)
@deathcardboyz Maybe they're staring at you thinking "...while isn't John's cock in between my legs yet... please make a move... <FLUSHED FACE>"
@djentjesus I like you Jenner, stay gold. :) <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@djentjesus It's so weird how people can find each other interesting, but to themselves, it's just always been a part of them. .~.
@djentjesus I lose interest in myself. <SLEEPY FACE>
I'm really hoping the highlighter in my room didn't just lunge itself freely out of place. <FLUSHED FACE>
@LighHife Strongly Dislike=Hate in Alex English, it's like regular English, but Alex English. Aka DGD.
Why is the term 'family jewels' so funny to me. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm just tryna see Issues right now ;~;
@KaliyahAlwright isn't it rather ridiculous they have to compare you to another person? Cause in the end, they don't meet the bar either.
@waldo124 I'll just text you the story xD Cause it's kinda long
@waldo124 I never told you about the incident that happened in my closet, right? o.0 Let's just say I sleep with my light on now.
@Troyboyyyyyy They do not disappoint. Thank you.
@djustdjent I bet you if I did that, I'd be left with patterns of demonic faces on the walls and floors and shit. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@djustdjent No, by the time, I'm crossing my fingers I'm already asleep before creepy shit starts happening in my room.
Jk, I ain't even tryna go to the strip. Because the only people who are old enough are already driving, and the rest of y'all are 12.
I finally now have my license physically. :) who tryna hit da strip now?

@AndrewG702 Stick To Your Guns is a band. And I'm also totally not gay. I mean I'm bad ass, <FLEXED BICEPS><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> or I'd like to think that at least...
I wonder if people see me and think if I actually might be gay. I mean I guess I do kind of throw off that vibe oops.
“@Juice_Gunzalez: I'll admit it, i'm ugly. But Spongebob taught me to be ugly and proud<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>” Probably the best shit I've read all day. :')
@McKayleigh you just let the pee run down your leg?! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Who pees in the shower? Cause obviously I'm mind blown at the idea, and I've never peed in the shower.
@cameron_swagner Because it's a form of courtesy. They're on the side of the road, goddamn. lol
@PaolaKoallla whoa, Alex's hair looks curly
@dillanesmarco maybe some other time :) lol
@dillanesmarco I didn't por que?
@Juice_Gunzalez no I didn't... <SLEEPY FACE>

@Juice_Gunzalez Then what are the rest of the steps made out of? ;~;
@JebCody I feel ya :) I like them, but they're definitely not up in my charts of fav bands, maybe in the 200's. xD
@JebCody Are you listening to their new stuff? Because if you are, that's where you're fucking up like everyone else. xDDD
@AsiaVsTheWorld I'm so slow at these stuff... <SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE>
I didn't know if you tilt your iPod around, the background acts like a gyroscope! o.0 That explains why the background is zoomed in a bit.
Today was a good day of skating. I need to start skating again. :)
@Sullliebby I am awake pls
I think the people who think theirselves are weird are actually the cooler people. Cause "cool" people are fucking weird...
@dillanesmarco This is my motto for life atm
I like my twitter header tbh :) get like me

I love issues tbh <RELIEVED FACE><BEATING HEART>
Play it up for me, cause no one here can see, all of your schemes so it's more like a dream!
I guess if you're in love with the streets, then you'll die in the sheets, 
with the coke on your chest and his lips on your cheek.
She's a mothafuckin' five living the life of a nine!
And thinking that she's a bad bitch, chick is a savage!
You know, I like the idea of having a girlfriend, because by the end day, nothing else really matters. <RELIEVED FACE> @Sullliebby
Sometimes I'm like, I'm a fucking weird person. But then I remember, I'm not weird at all, a lot of you guys are fucking weird. o.0
This Issues album will be the death of me. I'm in love. <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE>
Remember when, I was alone and crying out you will be missed, but I know that you're all better now~<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> :')

@Juice_Gunzalez what are you talking about, your tweets are my favorite. Heck, it's why I check twitter under the radar every day.
@WinterIstComing @br00taIbacon You guys are hilarious :')
@br00taIbacon The spirits in my dreams. <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>

On a better note, for once, I'm actually excited to celebrate valentines day. :)
@PaolaKoallla Came up with...?!?! Are you tell me it's not actually Paolers then... :'(
Have I become distant from everyone...? I don't feel aloof at all, but I guess I should stay in contact more often with everyone.
@PaolaKoallla I remembered asking if it was "pah-o-la" but no, it's Paolers. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I like Waldo, I haven't seen him in 5ever. Same with Jeb. @waldo124 @JebCody
I have so many pictures from among the year and it's kinda weird to think a lot has actually happened the past year. It's just overlooked.
@palmmtrees you'd have fun doing sleep overs with Jesse, the nigga won't even let me sleep xD @_Coronaaaa
@palmmtrees :) I'm a weirdo lol
The coolest people you'll ever meet are people who aren't even cool. Because cool people are fucking weird.
@VofIvan I'll try to! I definitely need to keep in touch with everybody more. :)
@VofIvan it really does feel like that too. :) hahha
Tbh I skated at Cranch today, and I'm in love with my board. And I saw honda mane too. @VofIvan

@VofIvan In that case, you always win. :)
@dillanesmarco I need to buy you a Christmas present :) lol
@dillanesmarco I feel like my chest went away too :( lol
@Juice_Gunzalez That 99 cents though! :)
@dillanesmarco and if that's ever the case, I can hook you up though <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I bought a single pair of 10 dollar socks. But it's ok, they happen to be in my favorite color.
@AsiaVsTheWorld @PaolaKoallla nice to meet you as a person I mean, not coworker <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@AsiaVsTheWorld @PaolaKoallla hmm, that's mighty fuckin weird then, but it's nice to meet you :) lol

I wanna stay cool with so many friends, but fuck, a good portion of you know you're a fake ass and can't figure shit out for yourself.
I wanna speak off my mind but it'd probably offend a good portion of you, but then again, I wouldn't give a fuck for a good portion of you.
@PaolaKoallla <RELIEVED FACE> The Jiggler is such a beautiful song.
@ItsStephanee it's ranch ratchets steph, and hang out with me and Jesse today pls :)

@JebCody Already happening. :(
@JohnCodyyy don't worry about it <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> I'm not in any rush, buts it's the gray one if you wonder which one.
@JohnCodyyy I think this is probably the coolest sentence I've just heard tbh. :) it's so cool.
@FabCrystalyo it's usually because of 'that one' class. Just that one that makes it hard. lol
@dillanesmarco I like you Marco. :) <OK HAND SIGN>
@waldo124 it's so weird because I still have a lot of pictures of like all of us together. And it's so weird to think we've all distanced.
@Troyboyyyyyy THATS WHAT IM SAYING. The ant is gonna be like "what's life. what the fuck. what do I do. do I starve to death?" lol
Since ants work in colonies and stuff, I wonder what happens if you isolate an ant into a chamber by itself and fed it. #ThoughtsAtABusStop
This Arizona Iced Tea Black and White tastes like newspaper if it were made into an extract.
@shhhnitzel it's about time tbh~ :D lol

@dillanesmarco I forget which one is it though... xD But I know which one when I play it. :) lol
I hope I did well on the interview... Because I felt like I did amazing. The only thing I lacked was job experience... :(
@dillanesmarco You have like one really nice fucking acoustic that I love and I would like to buy from you once I get a job. :(
I just gotta remember, the people who are applying for the same job are no better than I am, otherwise they'd be applying somewhere else.

@JohnCodyBTO Yeah, but I think I might leave in a bit to go eat out. D:
@Juice_Gunzalez I think she ended up hating me once the year came to an end. xD hahahha. or at least saw lower expectations of me.
@Juice_Gunzalez Fuck. :) Guess I gotta store my self with more fats. lol!
@_Coronaaaa I feel like my body eats my muscles for the extra energy... xD
@_Coronaaaa Lack of exercise problems. xD <OK HAND SIGN> I guess that means I'm sort of healthy or something because my legs feel normal still. :)

@mcampbell_x don't worry, it only applies to twitter~ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Sometimes I wanna tweet, but I feel like no one really gives a shit what I have to say... So then I stop myself from even bothering. .___.
@waldo124 "I play guitar in my band Off Trends" xD true! That was quick. LOLOL.
@ewos_ it's okay, we can still be friends. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@ewos_ I liked your last tweet, then you tweeted this. xD BWHAHAHAH. Done. lolol. :)
It seems that the people you actually care about get hurt the most. Maybe I'm just better off being "that background guy everyone knows".
I hate when people try to spread religion. Like people can find good morals without it. You don't see me shoving my fist down your throat.
@ItsStephanee BWHAHAHAHA. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> That one person is like "why you flicking me off?! I don't know you!"
Holy shit I'm finally home. And some of y'all are fake as fuck. Catch the hands. No but really, if the shoe fits, you're free to wear it.
Party it up at John's house!! Just me and myself! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> So lets get this on!
@waldo124 TRUE. BWAHHAHAH. xD
Some cop was telling me what happened, and I couldn't remember killing them, but I had blood on my hands and weapons where I woke up.
I had a weird dream. o.0 I woke up at a house and people were dead, and I was the killer and didn't even know... And then a party happened.
@Lesliebian_ I've listened to worst. o.0
@JohnCodyBTO just absence of heat and absence of dark.
@dillanesmarco is that the video game one...? o.0
@JohnCodyBTO Have a goodnights rest man. :)
@JohnCodyBTO They are a lot to be honest. :( Don't overkill yourself on cleaning them duude.
@PaolaKoallla And then there's people like me that don't need to be sneaky to get shit done right. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@AndrewG702 it just sounded so right to say. :)
@AndrewG702 A bottomless Jack Daniel's bottle? The drink would just fall on the floor. <PENSIVE FACE> :((((
Just got a weird ass voicemail and I'm crossing my fingers that it's not @ItsStephanee and @palmmtrees... .~.
@JohnCodyBTO SAME. o.o
@JohnCodyBTO wow. :) that's such a good line
@FabCrystalyo I feel like being a cop would still be boring as hell tbh. xD You could try both, then go with what makes you feel comfortable
@FabCrystalyo Do both then.
@ItsStephanee Damn, got a whole plan ahead of you. xD
@PaolaKoallla @JebCody  why not? :( could we not go to your house?
@JebCody @PaolaKoallla we all should. :)
@PaolaKoallla I can hang out with you maybe :-)
@PaolaKoallla What about tomorrow?
@PaolaKoallla And we're both so very conceited. xD hahha!
@PaolaKoallla Actually, I just wanted to say I miss you. :( the end.
@PaolaKoallla Paola, why are you on all my last 3 twitter pictures. o.0
“@JebCody: Rocky is really one of my favorite people. He's got the best personality.” :)
@Juice_Gunzalez Fuck. It may have rubbed off of me onto you once we met. o.0
@Lesliebian_ @waldo124 yeah I know... :b it's just kinda offending to make it seem like we're trying to keep the amp or something.
@waldo124 @Lesliebian_ Yah niggas hella heated... xD damn. It's not like we gave a shit about the amp, we just needed to borrow it... lol
@Jeanlucfolias that's why I cut my own hair now.
@ItsStephanee It actually feels really bad!! Long ago, I had a dream and I was trying to save Paolers, but she died in my arms. <PENSIVE FACE> I failed.
Check out what we've recorded. :)
It's just a demo, but maybe you guys can dig? It still needs so much more. xD

@LighHife oh. lol. I think you've told me that before...? lol. :)
@LighHife I'm trying to decipher this tweet but I have difficulty. :( Please elaborate.
@LighHife Hanging out definitely.

@JohnCodyBTO I'm sorry. Next time I'll just confront you about your make up. <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
Says no filter but has 5,000 pounds of make up on. Here's a tip to lose some weight, put less make up on. .~.
@Ahhchullly Yep. Fuck the Debbie downers who have low self-esteem. If they can't bring them self up, they get gotta levels others down.
@PaolaKoallla Because it's summer. Because its time to get a job. Because its easier. Because life makes more sense.
It was a good last show~ Peace out BTO! I'm out. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@stangilicious John, Jeb, Waldo, And Jesse are cancers. Capricorns include some of the groupie girls. xD and Justin is one too.
@GoodGirlJen_ no, I do the same to my own boobs.
@stangilicious A lot of people are cancers and capricorns.
@LighHife xDD I had to see and it had my dying! Hahahah!
@PaolaKoallla they do this like every year. lol
@JohnCodyBTO I think i remember sorta taking a picture before, but I don't remember when. :) lol
@JohnCodyBTO HAHAHAH I don't remember taking that either! xDD
@ItsStephanee nigga, everything is cute once I exist~ <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@ItsStephanee Oh well, proof of 18 years old now. :) Now we can buy sex toys and blunt wraps.
@ItsStephanee Your signature though! xD ahah
@ItsStephanee xD You look kinda funny in your ID though... lol
@_Coronaaaa it'd be stupid. Because shampoo cleans your hair, and conditioner is like adding a nice touch, it's not meant for cleaning.
@PaolaKoallla Hi. :-)
@_Coronaaaa I've read better versions of that joke.
Cali was cool ya know. Only because it was with friends. Pretty chill. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@PaolaKoallla I wanted to call you, but Jesse said you were asleep, so I didn't call you. Now I forgot what I was gonna tell you.
Ironic to say that I come off as uninterested or mad when I text people. Pls put a smiley next to my contact name.
I make myself feel better by adding a smiley to someone's contact name. So I can never get a plain/angry text. Everyone is always happy. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@CharmingMann You're tweeting like a pro. But you couldn't tread this tbh.
I wonder if I lost followers from that last tweet. xD Like "This fuckin' weirdo." But I wouldn't know, I don't keep up with that shit.
I'm not gay. I just love my self appearance so much to the point that if I ever saw me, I'd suck my own cock. Self-Esteem: Good Enough. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Tbh, I'm not about that twitter life~ But I like to keep up with every bodies life ya know. Everyone is important.<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Holy Shit, reading back my tweets, and I'm boring as fuck. I probably offend you guys like "Who the fuck brought this nigga here?"
@JebCody I bet you we'd get to round 18+ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Nigga's blind. Open your fucking eyes.
Fuck, where did the day go? Shit.
@MariaBovaaa It's not worth it then! I'd rather have you happy and carefree. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
@itstheshiiit @ItsStephanee @_Coronaaaa @PaolaKoallla @VirginReaper Why what? Did I miss something?
@JohnCodyBTO When I flirt, I'm like "Hey bitch. When do I get my dick sucked?"
@PaolaKoallla Ew, c'mon Paola, that's gross! I don't understand how people do such dirty things! <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@PaolaKoallla I never saw the ending of that movie! I never know how it ends now... :(
@JohnCodyBTO My favorite song by them though. :))))
C'MON MOM!! Let me be Mormon, all the cool kids are doing it except me... <PENSIVE FACE>
@PaolaKoallla
@_Coronaaaa @itstheshiiit 6 days, 1 hour, 37 minutes, and something seconds
It's feels so great to just lay in bed. <RELIEVED FACE>
I don't think I'm tire though... xD lol. Maybe.
But you know, life isn't fair. And you just learn to deal with the shit you're given.
If I could wish for anything in the world, I just wish my mother were more happier and never, ever stressed.
@slapdatbass11 xD Damn, that's harsh... LOL.
@waldo124 :) Anthony Green
@_Coronaaaa Looking at the people who favorited it and thinking that they drink more than Paolers though~
@waldo124 :') skate videos~
@Datt_Katt Thank you. :') These tears are real.
@Datt_Katt I'm actually really not quiet... xD Hahha... oops, I came off as a little bitch. I guess I can just never come off as cool. <CONFOUNDED FACE>
@ItsStephanee Really?? xD Already expecting a comment or something... oops. That makes me a jerk...
I wonder if I come off as a dick to people... I try to be kidding in the end. <PENSIVE FACE>
@ItsStephanee You deleted the picture off Instagram? xD Aw, that's lame.
@LighHife :) lol, true.
@LighHife It's spelled Marshmallow... <PENSIVE FACE>
@JohnCodyBTO :)
@PaolaKoallla Waking up isn't the trend~
@itstheshiiit @PaolaKoallla I should be telling you that... xD
@PaolaKoallla I'm just concerned for you. <RELIEVED FACE>
@itstheshiiit @PaolaKoallla I wouldn't be talking Itzel, you act younger than Paolers. xD
@PaolaKoallla That's even worse... xD The strip has stricter curfew laws... Are you with an 18 year old?
@PaolaKoallla Having a car isn't an exception for curfew though...
@PaolaKoallla Curfew~
@PaolaKoallla @itstheshiiit Y'all two little girls though.
@_Coronaaaa Favorite if you're American, and Favourite if your from UK. xD
@McKayleigh The cat tasted delicious. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@McKayleigh Did I miss a punch line...? :(
@ItsStephanee just wear the shades~
@twerkah Jesse says he will call you later
@twerkah talk to jesse
@J_EVZY You'd do me a favor if you didn't. <PENSIVE FACE>
@J_EVZY Shit. Fuck. Holy. Crap. Damn. Cunt. Nips. Crunk. Fucking. The. End.
@Ahhchullly @_Coronaaaa Along where? xD
@JebCody @Troyboyyyyyy Jebbers.
The doors open at 5:30, the first band plays at 6:00. The address is 3242 E Desert Inn Rd. Its some place called the Layla's Palace.
@FabCrystalyo Why? xD You should be happy. You deserve to be happy. You're like one of the nicest people alive and deserve the best. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@FabCrystalyo That's actually really smart. :) Because you wanna be a nurse. I'm actually really proud of you tbh.
@FabCrystalyo Volunteer long enough, and you could get paid. :)
@PaolaKoallla I could still love you and be rude. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@waldo124 You don't got old pictures of me. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@PaolaKoallla @waldo124 I retweeted it paolers.
@VivaLaJosy Aw, you're too kind. :')
@VivaLaJosy I am short. <PENSIVE FACE> Thanks for reminding me.
@LighHife xD HAHAH. True.
@Troyboyyyyyy I know right? hahha, well at least it's not Henderson. :b
@PaolaKoallla Not as happy as me. <RELIEVED FACE> Jk. Lol
@LighHife Aw, it'd be cool to have you there if you weren't at Arizona. :(
@Troyboyyyyyy Yeah, I searched it up and got the address. xD it's 3242 E Desert Inn road
@Troyboyyyyyy Sure man. :) I'll probably pay at the door though cause I haven't bought a ticket yet. xD hahha.
Hail The Sun, Stolas, and The Speed of Sound In Seawater on June 18th. :)
@alexa13reina Right? xD
WTF? It's 1:40??? o.0 I just made breakfast and its not even morning.
@JebCody :)))))
Me and Alan can shuffle a deck of cards. :) @VirginReaper Everybody knows you're cool if you can. And I mean both parts of it. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Swiggity Swag what's in the bag.
@renenikkuh That's actually... That's the most weirdest combination of bands, but it's actually really cool. :')
@ItsStephanee BWAHAHAHAHA. You're life is saved~ lol
@ItsStephanee isn't there a time zone delay too?
@Lesliebian_ That's what I meant when I said bf... <PENSIVE FACE> What else could there have been...?
@Lesliebian_ WHAT. YOU R 2 YOUNG LESLIE. WHAT R U DOIN? U CAN'T HAVE A BF YET. THAT'S IT, UR IN BIG TROUBLE.
@llamalondra xDD It looks like you're breaking down, you know, open up the pits. Lol
@PaolaKoallla Paola, you're fat. :)
Hi jeb
Hi
@ItsStephanee xD Aw. Poor Stephanee.
@Sullliebby WHY.
:') Aw. Lol. Is she here?
@OriginalMaritza Thank you, I appreciate it. x)
Man, this diploma is so beautiful. :')
My wifi doesnt work... :( and my phone is super slow on internet.
@Lesliebian_ <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Lesliebian_ Who's Rocky??? D:
@ItsStephanee @palmmtrees :') Aw, we're gonna look beast.
@LighHife Is that how I come off...? xD oops. I don't judge people for what they do though.
@aylupeee That's how I feel. Until I do something, this diploma means nothing to me.
@J_EVZY @Kitten_Mittenss they should be...? xD That's being stereotypic. lol. Idunno, everyone is entitled to their own opinion I guess. :b
@J_EVZY @Kitten_Mittenss You'd be surprised to see buff big people in a pop punk band though... With large ass gauges. Lol
@JohnCodyBTO @MarcoDillanes_ AND YOU CAN BORROW MY AXE.<FLEXED BICEPS><SMIRKING FACE>
@Kitten_Mittenss xDDD HAHHAHAHA
@MarcoDillanes_ Alright duude. :)
@Kitten_Mittenss I just remembered I read that from a book. You should just buy a new set and make them reappear and disappear. Mind fuck. <FLUSHED FACE>
@MarcoDillanes_ xD Well, my brother just  came back from town. So I can't really leave anywhere. But my you can come over when ever. :b
@ItsStephanee @chrisb0809 I think maybe class rank...? But I'm 1st in house 3. :))))
@Kitten_Mittenss xD lol. That reminds me of something but I forgot what... But it had to do with silverware disappearing and reappearing...
@MarcoDillanes_ hang out with me. :)
@MarcoDillanes_ @Ahhchullly Me and Jeb are too. And I wouldn't doubt it if Valeria and Dillon came too.
@melanyloveer @J_EVZY He just turned into a senior. He is in the same grade as him.
@Juice_Gunzalez That's how I feel. I forget its technically the last day for most people. But us, its like until we walk that stage.
@yogabbafaggot That's some sort of demon bunny or some shit. xD Hahha.
@yogabbafaggot Whoa wtf. o.0 I didn't think bunnies would eat apples. lol. Or you can feed it carrots. :) How stereotypic of me to say.
@_Coronaaaa We already have this. <RELIEVED FACE>
@yogabbafaggot Lettuce...? xD
That was actually some really good bacon...
It shouldn't be called freedom of religion. It should be called freedom to believe stupid answers or real answers. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@gioloves3 Hey man. :)
@_Coronaaaa The other day, Alex, Hozie, and I were at a Mexican party and we went to the park and there were so many bats flying around.
@LighHife Guys don't have periods.
@FabCrystalyo Maybe... As long as your not stiff at dancing~
@FabCrystalyo Nobody got moves like I do though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@J_EVZY Lets go fight them. :)
@J_EVZY As weird as it seems, I don't really invite anyone anywhere... :o I just kinda simply invite myself or just decide to hangout.
@JebCody Texting isn't even that cool~ xD All the real cool kids instead hang out. :))
@_Coronaaaa Y r u awake tbh?
@JebCody I think I might be going to Bunker too. :b
@JebCody @ArchaicSong I'm looking for an option that won't involve you at all
Some help to HOIST my sail off of its mast :b
@LighHife Okay, that's good man. :)
@LighHife I feel so bad, I heard. <PENSIVE FACE> Like it seriously sickens me seeing you go through shit you don't deserve.
Battle scars from skating~ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@daninellla You are so angry~ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> You're scaring me.
YES. I got 6 A's so far. :')) And then 1 C. lol. Obviously it's Government class. xD
@JohnCodyBTO I don't cheat in life. :( I never learned how to. <PENSIVE FACE>
#NameACrushYouHave Brandon, duh!11!!1!1 <RELIEVED FACE>
@Jeanlucfolias @PaolaKoallla Y'all don't scur me tho. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@JebCody Another EP??? xDD
@Whore_Heeyy Whoever he is~ he's probably a loser. <SMIRKING FACE>
@PaolaKoallla I'm jealous. :o
I wonder if people tried stalking me, and then they were like "Fuck, there's nothing to stalk." <SMIRKING FACE> Oops. I'll try to be more interesting.
@JebCody I never listened to them. :o
@JebCody Like to be filled with thoughts of the past and stuff. D;
@JebCody I love the winter! I hate feeling nostalgic. :(
Have you ever had bands that just  remind you of winter...? Yeah.. It's not really a good feeling considering it makes me feel nostalgic. <PENSIVE FACE>
Music is amazing. Music is life. Dude, if I had no music, I'd be the saddest person alive... <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL>
I keep writing myself into rust, it's all around us<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><RELIEVED FACE>
@PaolaKoallla I'm bored too. :( Jesse isn't here.
@SatansNipss It's the wheels. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> They get me too.
@Staygoldmiles :') aw.
I finally finished my 15 page assignment for government class. <RELIEVED FACE> I am at peace now... I feel like I'll probably end up getting a C. lol
We all know who that best hair award actually should've gone to though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Niggas couldn't possibly beat my hair~
All the freshman look like little babies. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ishronalynnn You made sense, no worries. xD
@ishronalynnn I listen to a large variety of bands... xD And yes, I listen to the Arctic Monkeys...
@ishronalynnn Which music is that...? :o
9 out of 15 pages complete for this assignment. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I am quite proud of myself. 6 more to go~
@PaolaKoallla I'll join you for my next haircut. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I don't really mind the 15 page assignment for government class... xD It kinda guides us through each page. As long as there's no essays~ <NEUTRAL FACE>
@PaolaKoallla XDD I'm like "Done with lyfe. Stahp. Bye."
@alexa13reina That kinda was funny actually. xD You know, yolo lyfe.
@alexa13reina Yeah, things are quite swell here. xD It could've been worse. lol
@JebCody Niiiiice. :DDD
@JebCody I just downloaded their EP Rain In July. :o I didn't know they had another EP. I'll check that one out later. :)
@alexa13reina Hey Lexa! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@JebCody I'm kinda glad I did. Such an amazing band. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Neck Deep is such a beautiful band. :')
People sometimes overanalyze stuff to find an answer, but other times the answer is in front of you whether you want to accept it or not.
But if I had to say the best part of yesterday, it's probably the fact I skated. :') Aka good skate day.
Yesterday wasn't too bad.
@Troyboyyyyyy xDD Why is this so funny??? LOL
@LighHife There's an band called Hot Hot Heat. xD
@WinterIstComing I'd like to meet him. :))
@_Coronaaaa I like how you have to mention the "before she got pregnant" part. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Some guys are pervs when it comes to them interacting with girls. <PENSIVE FACE> What gives them that mindset...? Respect a woman, gee~
@Troyboyyyyyy @d3vilwearsgucci Ectothermic creatures~ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@PaolaKoallla You look a lot like Genesis in this picture... xD
I hate dreams where you get all ready for another day school. Then you wake up. And you're like fuck, now I gotta repeat the process.
I should probably start on my government homework... *looks at it* ...or I can always sleep. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I got a varsity letter for a letterman jacket that I don't have. x) I feel accomplished. It's something I could look back on. :')
*has never shown up*
@MariaBovaaa But we can hang out at lunch! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I just need someone to accompany me to hang out with you.
@MariaBovaaa It's not that I don't know these people. xD Cause I've always known them. I just never hang out with them outside of school.
I'm not gonna lie, but today was an interesting day... Hanging out with people I don't normally hang out with. lol <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
NO. MORE. BIOLOGY. <RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE><RELIEVED FACE> Now time to do government homework in shame... lol
@LighHife @Troyboyyyyyy The Wonder Years are cool. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Why is the government teacher giving us more work during this time??? <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> We got Mothafucking AP Exams! W-T-F.
@PaolaKoallla Idunno if you can actually... I have the AP Biology exam tomorrow. :(  And I'm not sure how the schedule works... lol.
@PaolaKoallla You're making me "road cake pops"? :)))))) Mmmmm. Thank you.
People say humans are the perfect beings, but what does it really mean to be perfect...? I think we're just like any other organism.
I feel like a nerd tweeting some science shit. xD
I don't think it'd ever be possible to end life on earth. Unless you took the earth away, then that would only be logical.. but unrealistic.
@Lesliebian_ You're not a bother. You're Leslie. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Studying for AP Biology really isn't too hard... At least when you've understood the concepts. It's just the terms I need to remember. xD
@daninellla I didn't even realize you were being mean. Maybe I'm blind. lol. But if it makes you feel better, you're apology is accepted. <WHITE SMILING FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
@daninellla You were being one...? xD I didn't take it that way. I thought I was being rude. Lol.
@VivaLaJosy Thanks! :)
Gotta study for AP Biology! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Damn, I hope I get a 5 on this test...
@LighHife Pretty handsome~ <SMIRKING FACE>
@JebCody @Troyboyyyyyy Yeah, we also need somebody on the harp and violin.
@JebCody @palmmtrees Thanks. :) We about that senior life. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@LighHife Check out a song called "Seeds" by them. :) I think you'll like them maybe.
@LighHife Exotic Animal Petting Zoo. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@BrittneyyyRawr Who? :o
@JebCody I still love you regardless, whether you like it or not!!1!11! <ANGRY FACE>
@JebCody We'll hang out hopefully soon. :) Because love.
@MarcoDillanes_ True. :)
@MarcoDillanes_ xD Oops, I broke my board. :b lol
@BrittneyyyRawr Cause you don't bother to try!
@WinterIstComing Really? xD From where?
@BrittneyyyRawr YOU'RE A FAG.
@Lesliebian_ D;
@ItsStephanee @Juice_Gunzalez I kinda wanna be there for that too... <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@palmmtrees uh... Idunno to be honest... But it's a day between 10-20. xD
@_Coronaaaa Shaddup. You know what you meant~ <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> You even corrected it with another tweet.
@MarcoDillanes_ It really is legit though~ :')
@_Coronaaaa Only you would post this on twitter. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><PISTOL>
@MarcoDillanes_ That's actually cool. But I thought you dislike Halo...? xD
I mean if you're capable of taking your time to learn these bizarre philosophies, why don't you take the time to learn some real shit...?
I think it's unusual for someone to believe in these crazy ideas that "seem" to make sense, but don't bother to understand the science.
It's your fault I'd say, I let this blind me, Forlorn in sullen head, suffer your ill intent~ <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
@thunderqueef_ Jelly. D; You have so much space. I wish I could have as much as you. <PENSIVE FACE>
Aw, The Story So Far's new album is actually really good. :') I'm starting to get hooked onto it.
Today's word of the day, Apathetic. A lot of people nowadays are apathetic because they are lazy. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@aylupeee xD Idunno, he's just cool. lol
@BrittneyyyRawr Me too. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@LighHife Idunno whos going. :o
@waldo124 True~ I ain't about that life though. xD
I think the student teacher for Government class doesn't affiliate with religion. Or at least that's what I picked up from his responses. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
The stuff that we, the band, do is rather hilarious and random. :') Other friends included too of coarse. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
It's funny how Waldo ended up getting 2 fries and 2 shakes because the first order wasn't his and he grabbed it by accident. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @waldo124
@BrittneyyyRawr @lesliebian_ we are the future like no one ever knew you.
@Sullliebby <WHITE SMILING FACE>
@Sullliebby <PENSIVE FACE> Then I guess you're never real to me.
@Sullliebby You don't ever seem like the one to ever get annoyed or mad to be honest... xD What side am I missing to see...? lol
Oh my god, I love getting new bands! Ah, music is life. x)
@aylupeee Oh, I lied, just that story. xD
Good band practice session. Gotta get ready for the upcoming show. :)
@aylupeee It really is! :)))) one of my favorite by Shakespeare.
@Sullliebby Well duh! That's what friends are for! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Sullliebby That makes you .00001x cooler than what you originally are. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> And if it helps, decimals make a number smaller when multiplied.
@Sullliebby Since when did you listen to Coconut Records??? <NEUTRAL FACE>
@Medusa_Cascade_ Did you see the video? xDD
@PaolaKoallla ME. Yuck. Why do I talk sometimes. My laugh is horrible too~ <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@PaolaKoallla It's weird because I could eat something if it fell on the floor. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> But I greatly dislike being messy/dirty, it aggravates me.
@J_EVZY :') We gotta make "caress" a more popular word among the group.
@PaolaKoallla I am too actually. Even though I seem like I wouldn't be the type of guy... But I really am! D:
Caress is a beautiful word. <RELIEVED FACE> "I gently caressed her hair in such refinement." I wish I had a much broader vocabulary to speak intelligent.
@waldo124 I'll play Santa's role in the scene. :')
I want my child to know why things are the way they are and why certain customs exist. I also want my child to appreciate them too. <SMIRKING FACE>
I'll make sure my child knows Santa isn't real, but we would still celebrate Christmas because its a tradition everyone celebrates. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@twerkah okay! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I'd want my child to be a natural genius rather than to present him with faulty information and find out everything is a lie in the future.<WHITE SMILING FACE>
If I have a child and he asks where do babies come from, I'll end up giving him the biggest lesson on how and why life works and stuff. <RELIEVED FACE>
@twerkah WTF?!1?!!!11!?1! I can't Ben do that... <PENSIVE FACE> My mom will never know if Im straight now...
@PaolaKoallla @waldo124 Oh wow~ <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Rude. lol
Erased the text written in the books, rewrote them with words from my mouth to shatter clouds like crooks~ <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I'm not feeling down, I'm not being sadistic, but you tear my bliss and it makes me sick~
Tomorrow is already gonna be Wednesday...? :o This is gonna be a fast week.
I still think our best song we've made is "It's Going to Be A Long Semester". :') It needs to be tightened up a bit though. <PENSIVE FACE>
@Sullliebby But they are~~ <HATCHING CHICK>
@LighHife @spitxout We read the signs! Completely backwards~
@LighHife @slapdatbass11 what...? :o
@slapdatbass11 @lighhife Yeah, Attila's new single is beast. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><OK HAND SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
@LighHife Probably the best lyric video I've seen thus far~ :')
@LighHife Check out the lyric video "Medusa" by the band Stolas. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
@PaolaKoallla I swallow.
@daviddump Are you lying...??? :o
@ItsEmilyAlicia 31 days I mean. <PENSIVE FACE>
@ItsEmilyAlicia You ain't gonna get a more refined butt than me though~ I do 31 squats. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><OK HAND SIGN>
@BrittneyyyRawr Down the stream, not across the river.
@BrittneyyyRawr Definitely, totally. Thanks. YOU'RE THE REASON I CUT MYSELF. <PENSIVE FACE>
@PaolaKoallla <PENSIVE FACE>
We built this city off hangovers. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
It's cause I'm fabulous bitch nigga~ <WAVING HAND SIGN><RELIEVED FACE>
Damn, I'm already getting tanned... <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I kinda like it, but it's only gonna get worse... Lol
Stolas sounds a lot like A Lot Like Birds. xDD That's weird saying. lol
I want grape soda now... <PENSIVE FACE>
@Troyboyyyyyy That's so crazy! :') Damn.
@cameron_swagner :') I can die happily now.
@JebCody Amazing actually! :')
Someone listen to Stolas with me. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I don't want to be the only one to enjoy this beautiful band.
We fell like others when this world was so cold,
But never like this, now this doesn't feel like home
#talkaboutyourcrushnight I prefer orange crush and sometimes grape crush. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
My brother Andrew bought me some Taco Bell. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Fuck yeah~
@MarcoDillanes_ My life. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Sullliebby There goes 1 of your three wishes. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Already running out.
@waldo124 You flatter me too much. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Sullliebby We can just fly there. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I got such an awkward smile. I can't even smile properly... <PENSIVE FACE>
@waldo124 Damn Waldo, hella sexy. x)
@JebCody @waldo124 It does. xD Where's your new house...?
@FabianKillThem Double negative! Meaning it'd be cool still. :(
Stolas is a great band. <RELIEVED FACE>
@ItsStephanee xD You guys are cool kids~
@BrittneyyyRawr It's my friend's little sister's quince. xD And I got invited, and I was like aw, how adorable. :')
@BrittneyyyRawr D; aw, that's lame...
@BrittneyyyRawr I'll come home for a bit tomorrow, but then I gotta leave for a quince. xD
@BrittneyyyRawr It's just meth, nothing serious!1!!11!
Hi
@jasminime They're playing Vegas??? :o
@LaBrittnee :D Yay. <BABY ANGEL>
@LaBrittnee we can be friends. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Pinheaaad D; I know. Woops, I'm horrible, I need to learn to keep in touch with family. <OK HAND SIGN>
@Pinheaaad You're like 2 years old, so it'd only make sense. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@daviddump @sullliebby But it's not cheating if you wish for a lot of magic lamps. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@MarcoDillanes_ Well, even if you were average height, it still wouldn't be right. It's a lose-lose situation. <PENSIVE FACE>
@Juice_Gunzalez @guycodes TRUE. :)))))
@Juice_Gunzalez Get Steph. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FabianKillThem Sodomy is where it's at though~ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
So throw away the love that we made~ <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
It looks so bright outside. :o It looks like it could be 4-5 am.
Maybe I'll make tomorrow a Circa Survive day and just play every album. :D
Circa Survive has to be like one of the best bands alive. Like, Idunno. They're too amazing. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Gotta get baseball tee's to be more pop punk. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> Maybe some pizza too. <OK HAND SIGN>
Technically "Bio Life" would be redundant considering Bio means life itself. Catch me on that Life Life~
There's no way I would ever memorize all 50 states and their capitals/major cities. Ain't about that life. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><OK HAND SIGN> Catch me on that Bio life~
I wanna post stuff on Instagram but I have nothing important to post. <PENSIVE FACE>
@CharmingMann Hella memorize the balanced equation of respiration. xD
I go over Issues's entire Black Diamonds EP twice, almost a third, during each period at school. <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm surprised I haven't gotten bored of Issues yet cause I always blast them every once in awhile. But I wish they had more than 6 songs~
@LighHife As long as the song can give you shivers down your spine, then it works. <OK HAND SIGN>
Issues is working on that new material though! <RELIEVED FACE><OK HAND SIGN> Hooligans~ Great song.
That new Attila song though~ <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><OK HAND SIGN> Can't wait for the new album now.
@Pinheaaad If you can't hang then, there's the door baby~ <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
Actually, I lied, cardigans are nice if pulled off right. <RELIEVED FACE> But Jesse can't rock them. :)
@_Coronaaaa @lighhife @paolakoallla Jesse, you remind me of an old person when you were a cardigan. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@LighHife @paolakoallla @_coronaaaa Cardigans are awkward, idunno. xD
@_Coronaaaa Just one. Do you want it? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@LighHife @paolakoallla @_coronaaaa Cardigans are for old people. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@_Coronaaaa WHAT. Well, cardigans are gross.
@JebCody I've done that before actually. xD I was just too tired and I say there as the shower poured on me. :')
@Erhhk <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Hahha, It's been awhile since I've listened to them.
I feel like a piñata 
Won't you take a swing at me
If you could just crack the shell open
I think inside you would find something sweet
Don't adore what is impossible, we have built this ship in a wine bottle.
@BrittneyyyRawr Stoooopid. Where you with your friends? xD Like what the hell,  you're only in 7th grade.
@BrittneyyyRawr xD Hypocrites. That's all I can really say.
@ItsStephanee Polk-a-dot jeans though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@PaolaKoallla I'm like an undercover protector actually. I protect you, but we can't talk, that would make me not so undercover then. <WHITE SMILING FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
@PaolaKoallla I ACTUALLY WOULD. Even though we never talk. But I need to protect you like a child of mine. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@_Coronaaaa phew <RELIEVED FACE>
I hate when a band's album art has that thick white border. It's like, can you not? <PENSIVE FACE>
I don't like cardigans on guys... They remind me of old grandpas.
@BrittneyyyRawr what happened...? :o aka text me.
@BrittneyyyRawr WHO CARES. xDD If they wanna follow me, let them. Besides, that means more followers for me. Aka I'm cool. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@BrittneyyyRawr Listen to them! They're amazing though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@BrittneyyyRawr Nigga don't even listen to Of Mice &amp; Men. <WAVING HAND SIGN><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Lesliebian_ HAPPY BIRTHDAY LESLIE. Sorry I couldn't make it to the show. :( But we can still celebrate your day, maybe with the band too.<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@daviddump ISSUES. IS. AMAZING. &gt;:cc
I'm not going to see Issues tomorrow. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PISTOL>
I've been thinking maybe I should just let my hair be natural from now on.
Anthony Green is so cool. :)
@PaolaKoallla How did they tell you this...? xD
Don't expect anything to happen, just accept what does.
Stop relying so much on people and rely on yourself.
@PaolaKoallla Hey. :) Aka judging you.
@chelsea_smilee Rage-aholics anonymous!
@JessIsABoss69 It's like Pandora but for hipsters. :)

I also wanna see "The Great Gatsby" because Leonardo DiCaprio is in it. :))
I wanna see the movie "This Is The End". <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> So many famous people in it.
When you don't wanna take a lot of  trips back and fourth with the groceries, so instead you carry like a hundred bags on both hands. <SMIRKING FACE>
Gotta catch up on homework and life. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Sundays are probably my least stressful day.
@PaolaKoallla @fabiankillthem Same. <SMIRKING FACE>
@JessIsABoss69 Glad I could make you laugh. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I love eating pancakes, but they give me the hiccups... <PENSIVE FACE>
@LighHife Then they die an awkward way and you're like "I lose all interest in them forever." <NEUTRAL FACE>
Conor Oberst=Amazing Lyricist. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

@BrittneyyyRawr It's Issues, but I mixed up the lyrics... xD King of Amarillo.
SEGA. We ain't playing fame! Since you took demise, we'll take the games!
Got the swag of a nemesis, and the heart of a coward! If you don't like Genesi[s], then go listen to these lyrics!
@_Coronaaaa Psh, I'm doing that regardless. <OK HAND SIGN>
@_Coronaaaa We could get a job together. :)
@Pinheaaad Monday felt like a Friday to this week actually... D:
@J_EVZY I'M JUST KIDDING. x) It just felt at the right time to say. Aka, Ily with all my hearts. &lt;333
@J_EVZY You look thirsty. :) Get a drink too.
Chances are that it won't drop though because this case gives it more of a grip instead of being slippery without one... <PENSIVE FACE>
I finally got an iPod case. :)) Now I can drop my iPod on the floor however I like, whenever I like.
@J_EVZY Aw, so cuute. (;
@_Coronaaaa Why weren't you at school...? xD
@Juice_Gunzalez Flip a techer off. xD
@JohnCodyBTO I like how my headphone is in the picture. xDD Like woops, I houldn't be listening to music in school. x))
@JohnCodyBTO I vent with the AC. Because it does its job well.
Life changes all the time, you can either choose to pick up with the pace or get left behind.
@Juice_Gunzalez :'(( Oh yeah...
@MariaBovaaa Definitely because we are gangsters. :)
@BrittneyyyRawr Uh, aha. You get on my level before we talk. x) K.THX.BYE.
Actually, I probably wouldnt be able to afford it. I lied. x)
I like science. :) I'ma be a nerd when I grow up.
@MariaBovaaa Yes you are. Now we can hang out at lunch. :b Aka messed up at tweeting.
I hate using twitter on the phone... .___.
@PaolaKoallla But it doesn't... :( I'm just... Idunno. <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL> I'm sorry.
@PaolaKoallla JUST BECAUSE I DON'T TALK TO YOU DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T MISS YOU. <TIRED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
@PaolaKoallla UH. I NOTICED. <SLEEPY FACE> I cried especially on Monday though because I was the only one left out of the table...
I just did my last AP Biology assignment that'll ever require the book :') Fuck. This is depressing.
Actually, I've should've gotten short hair long ago. :b
Everyone's been getting short hair. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I should be next.
There's a difference between being above everyone else and convincing yourself you are.
Here's a Demo of what we have guys. :) #PopPunk #BeneathTheOcean

Aw, Darinel invited me to her quince. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> How sweet of her, I feel appreciated.
@d3vilwearsgucci Woops... xD I tried not to. :)
@Lesliebian_ by who...? :o
I have nothing to look forward to at school. What is life now. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><PISTOL>
@Lesliebian_ @_coronaaaa TRUE. :) I do that all the time.
It's only Monday...This is gonna be a long week. Then again, I just need a break from life.
@Lesliebian_ True~ <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>

"This track obviously wasn't vaccinated as a kid, because it's sick as hell." xD True~ Lol!
History will just repeat and you will pass your poison down onto your child's feet.
I used to be afraid that this would end, Now I embrace it.
@Pinheaaad :(
@Pinheaaad I'm my daddy's little princess. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@LighHife Where'd you guys walk to...? xD
@WolfKur0 :D They rock! I didn't think anybody else listened to them.
I just watched a video of someone throwing a dog like a many stories down. <PENSIVE FACE>
@JebCody He's good. :o
@PaolaKoallla GROSS. xDD
@JebCody D: uh... I thought Waldo couldn't hang out today. <PENSIVE FACE>
@JebCody Is he coming...? :o
@PaolaKoallla Aw. :(
@LighHife Aren't you gonna hang out with Jesse? xD
Why is this song about Rape??? xD It's awkward... But it's such a beautiful song. :')
Holy shit, I just realized I'm failing Government class right now. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> That test though~ Woops.
@Pinheaaad Ask Valeria for her books~
@waldo124 Hella fucked... xD
This is basically what Valeria does to me. <PENSIVE FACE> 
@ScarpatiSmiles Yes my brothers. xD Richard being one of them.
My brothers are arguing about religion. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Once again, overrated topic. Just accepted god and shut up.
@Pinheaaad xD Aka can rock every hair color. Jealous.
Not like anyone ever cares for each other in this world. I already have my family and friends in place.
I might sound heartless and all, but when I put you in a level at which we're strangers, then I'm pretty sure you'd be all heartless.
To be honest, I feel content and good without you in my life. Because I don't even consider you family even if you were to die.
@Lesliebian_ SAME HERE. <PENSIVE FACE> I should've bought a ticket long ago...
@Lesliebian_ Con que? :o
@Lesliebian_ don't worry. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I'm a bad parent anyway.
@Lesliebian_ Woops, I knew something felt different today. I forgot all about the baby. I think it died. :(
@LighHife Im sure you can man! :) Don't fuck up.
@Lesliebian_ What baby...? D;
@LighHife Then the other two formulas apply: (Good Grades+Sleep=No Social Life) and (Social Life+Sleep=Bad Grades) <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Hope this helps!
@LighHife <SMIRKING FACE> Nigga say what...? Lol. The formula is "good grades+social life=no sleep"
John bought me Cream Soda. x) Yum. @JohnCodyBTO
@Pinheaaad NO. I prefer you this way. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@d3vilwearsgucci @sullliebby BURRITO QUEEN. xD Forever holding this against you Valeria...
Some people don't deserve to stick their tongue out in self portraits... xD
@_Coronaaaa Check your iMessage!
@_Coronaaaa xD Obviously you do... Lol.
@d3vilwearsgucci @sullliebby More like, sometimes Valeria prepares it badly... <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><OK HAND SIGN>
@Kitten_Mittenss That's kinda awkward to do in public... xDD
@Sullliebby LOL. Let the tears roll~
@JohnCodyBTO Aw. x)
I only ran on a few hours of sleep... :o Crossing my fingers I dont get homework today...
@waldo124 go to sleep, you have homeschool tomorrow! (;
@keanupoppyseed In that case... No one ever dreams of me. <PENSIVE FACE> lol
Sometimes I wonder how is it even possible to eat 2,000-2,500 calories everyday. <FLUSHED FACE> Like I barely manage to eat 2,000 calories on a good day.
“@BTO_LV: Anyone like demos!?...... Yea neither do we 
April Fool's is tomorrow. :o
@Pinheaaad I like starbursts. :(

I'm totally doing all my homework on the last day. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Sullliebby Me 2. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
When you eat something hot, then drink  something cold, and your teeth are like "Really...? Why tf did you just do that?"
I thought I was gonna go over my cousin's house. :( Oh well, I'm home alone and I bought myself Panda. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> Then off to work out. Lol.
@cameron_swagner I'll probably buy a bundle when I get the money. :) <OK HAND SIGN>
@PaolaKoallla @troyboyyyyyy Where did the eggs come from...? <NEUTRAL FACE>
@thunderqueef_ You are mean though. :') But its okay.
@thunderqueef_ :) okay. You're mean though.
@thunderqueef_ :( Sorry.

@LighHife When should I head to your house...? :o
@PaolaKoallla I know... <PENSIVE FACE> I'm an idiot... Ah, I messed up. Why did I take this test so late. I'm already a senior and I procrastinated.
Oops, I messed up on my SAT's... xD Ah, oh well, I got bored reading the shit. Next is my AP test. :)
@LighHife Alright. :)

@RingMyDingaLing <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> DAMN.
@thunderqueef_ I wish. :(
@Pinheaaad <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> It really looks like it would say that!
@WolfKur0 Pillows are better anyways. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><OK HAND SIGN> lol
@WolfKur0 I'm like the same way. xD Otherwise it's awkward without anything to like hold onto. :(
Hope y'all have fun at Extreme thing. <WHITE SMILING FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
@Pinheaaad Bloated stomach means you got a whole load ready to be deposited. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> I cannot imagine how large that shit will be.
@Pinheaaad @lighhife Aka, it helps you poop. <SMIRKING FACE>
@Pinheaaad @lighhife Pepto Bismoh~ <SMIRKING FACE>

@Sullliebby Oh. <UNAMUSED FACE>

@PaolaKoallla I'm not... xD
xD This song is sick, and the intro is funny. LOL. “@JebCody: Check this demo out 
@Kitten_Mittenss Basically it. xD
I mean, why back up a belief that you or anyone couldn't possibly prove...? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><OK HAND SIGN>
My brother thinks too spiritually and has far fetched beliefs. xD Biology is just way too accurate as compared to something that's made up.
@JebCody Thanks duude. x)
I feel dead. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK> So I should probably rest in peace. <SLEEPING FACE>
Aw, Shifting Sails finally released something. :') Aka #IndieLyfe

@_Coronaaaa Why?
@ItsStephanee xDD Can you not? LOL. :)
@LighHife x) Nah. Lol. When you coming back from cowtown though?
@LighHife I cussed out the creator of twitter. And he deactivated me.
@LighHife I was deactivated. My bad.
@BrittneyyyRawr What do you mean...? xD
Follow my band page if you haven't. :)

@Pinheaaad You're such a nice person... :) I don't want you fucking up, you have so much potential for someone your age.
I just want my distance away from everyone at this point. I need to grow up, focus on what will actually get me somewhere in life.
@BrittneyyyRawr Talk to me when you can Ollie. <SMIRKING FACE>
I got to see Derrick and Ryan. :) Fuck, I need skate. And Jesse is cool. lol
@BrittneyyyRawr You're crazy!? It's about to hit 11! That's past your curfew!
@LighHife :) Yeah, I'm down.
@LighHife x) I know! Ah, why must you go??? We could've hung out. :(
@LighHife Like a day to remember homesick?
@palmmtrees x) Then this is your chance.!!

We hurry to our death 
Well, I lagged behind 
So you got ahead
“@BrittneyyyRawr: This is so @rockzist <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@BrittneyyyRawr That really is!!! xDD
Just because you're family, it doesn't make you more special. You're just like any other human to me.
@slapdatbass11 We definitely won't separate though. :)
@rturoCacho Dang, how long have you guys been friends...? <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Lesliebian_ It really is. :(

@Lesliebian_ Amazing song and video. :') 
The Color Morale sounds cool. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Drunk_monkeys67 Psh, things will happen though. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Aw, the "Princeton Ave" music video for Issues is so sad... I was about to cry. <SLEEPY FACE>
@jasminime Everyone is. :o
@JebCody xDD I meant I, but Idunno how that happened... I'm sleepy. So yeah..
@JebCody Like how Zoi deposited money for the test? <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@waldo124 Why...? D:
@_Coronaaaa Fine... :(
@CharleenCorona subtract the k...? xD Hocus Pocus...?
@Juice_Gunzalez I don't know anything about real, but I'll get you one. <WINKING FACE>
@PaolaKoallla xD Yeah, but Psh, which teacher isn't in love with me...? <SMIRKING FACE>
@waldo124 At the end, he was like, "Fuck, I don't wanna date her anymore." xD
@PaolaKoallla That's with Ms Kienzle. :) She's so cool. Her class won't be hard either. <OK HAND SIGN>
@waldo124 :)
@PaolaKoallla Which science...? :b
@Kitten_Mittenss You're lame. xD lol. I don't wanna be that freak. :b
@Kitten_Mittenss I go to Cheyenne... xD lol
I just wish we could all be together and never connection with anyone. But I feel like this is probably how life was meant to be anyway.
Damn, in order for me to go to college, I have to make sacrifices... <UNAMUSED FACE> And if I don't go, then chances are people will later.
@WinterIstComing @shiftingsails :))
@WinterIstComing @shiftingsails FINALLY.
If I'm going to college, it's going to be for science... I don't really like any other class besides math.
It just hit me that I'm finally graduating... <NEUTRAL FACE> It only hit me because I was thinking about how soon Biology is ending... I love Biology. <PENSIVE FACE>
@JebCody What do a teenager and a Helicase have in common...? They both wanna unzip your genes. :)
Anthony Green is guest vocals in a song that Say Anything made. :') That's so weird.
@JohnCodyBTO LOL. :) Same. Aka, my life.
@JohnCodyBTO :) Too many memories. Then we'd get moved away, and begin to cry. <PENSIVE FACE>
@JohnCodyBTO :b We'd get F's because we'd spend too much time talking. LOL. Or maybe A's if we pretend to know what we're talking about. xD
@JohnCodyBTO Too much! :)
@JohnCodyBTO Aw. :) I wish I had classes with you guys! But senior probz~ lol
Can't wait for Issues music video. :)))))
@LighHife Aw, fuck. Fine, you caught me... xD
@LighHife umm... No I don't. xD Why are you stalking me??? :(
Erased the text written in the books! Replaced them with words from my mouth to shatter clouds like crooks.
@_Coronaaaa This is where I come in play to protect you. :)
Even after eating a quesadilla, I don't feel quite as satisfied. I need some meat! <CONFOUNDED FACE>
For the longest, until now, I finally know what a cabinet is in government terms. :) It's not a cabinet, that's for sure. LOL.
@GoodGirlJen_ Okay. :) <OK HAND SIGN>
@ThereGoesLiz Okay. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@GoodGirlJen_ I'll make Mac, and you make cheese. :D If that makes sense.
@PaolaKoallla I'll... try... not to... <UNAMUSED FACE>
@ThereGoesLiz But you didn't cook it. <PENSIVE FACE>
@GoodGirlJen_ :) I'd love some.
@PaolaKoallla xD This weather though...
@ThereGoesLiz :D
I WANT SOME FOOD. <PENSIVE FACE> I can't focus on doing my homework on an empty stomach... Someone cook for me please...
@PaolaKoallla Me too. :)
@palmmtrees xDD My Life.
I wish I could just do everything at once.
This weather has been getting warmer, and I've been feeling nostalgic since it has been kicking in. :(
I can unwrap a starburst with my mouth in 20 seconds. :) Aka, I love starbursts.
I'm not gonna get anywhere in life if all I do is put people before me. Because I end up pushing away the stuff that I really want.
I'm bad when it comes to me getting what I want. And it's not that I don't want it, I just need to stop being so selfless.
@_Coronaaaa Aka Emo.
