@LaurenDeStefano can I wait to see if I win your giveaway first?
I got Receive Your Hogwarts Letter! Can We Guess Your Goal In Life? 
@RachelllRaeee awesome! thank you!!
@RachelllRaeee that sounds great!!
@RachelllRaeee the UK cover? Yes ma'am.
"I know how to chop off this guy's head" #GoT
@RachelllRaeee I prefer hardcover.
@RachelllRaeee that's them.
@RachelllRaeee there's no link. If they're too hard to find I'll take arc's of Andrew smith's or UK versions of daughter of smoke and bone.
@RachelllRaeee that's not them.
@RachelllRaeee this is what I have. 
@RachelllRaeee I am collecting UK version of the HP books...
@RachelllRaeee I don't have a wish list or anything like that. grave mercy is the only thing I really want but I'd be up for something else.
@RachelllRaeee yes.
@RachelllRaeee all I've seen is people that have that one and are wanting ARCs of the other two so they have all three. :\
I still don't understand how in all of the #booksfortrade or #haveyouseenthis, there's not an arc of gave mercy.
@LaurenDeStefano being from Texas, I'm astounded people don't know what sweet tea is. it's different than having unsweet and adding sugar.
tomorrow night is one my night off and I don't even get to sleep because I have errands. I really wish the rest of the world ran at night.
why is it that the more nights in a row I work, the more trouble I have falling asleep?
were ARCs of grave mercy even a thing? nobody seems to have one in #booksfortrade or anything like that and I really need one. :(
know what's awesome? getting to work and realizing you forgot your lunch.
I have a modcloth problem. somebody take my money so I stop buying clothes please.
I got Gus! Which Disney Sidekick Should Be Your BFF?

Dragons vs. birds? I definitely want to win a hardcover of The Girl At Midnight! @whatisakelly 
@DudneyD that was stupid.
when you don't work a typical schedule, it sucks hearing/seeing people talk about their weekends plan. I'll be working while you have fun...
maybe now picking out what to read next won't be so hard! (thanks @nerdherdreads!) 
maybe it will rain today and the roofers can't continue working on my neighbor's roof so I can get some sleep.
I hate when I have to change my passwords.

came home to two geese and a cat in the yard. Austin pointed out our home is now the place of the aristocats.
I'm pretty sure the only reason I want kids someday is so I can experience the joy of reading Harry Potter for the first time again.
@Harlee_S I have this and I love it. I still need to try something out of it though...
this whole "knee cramping up and feeling tense" while I'm doing nothing is starting to get old.
on demand isn't working and Netflix is acting weird. how am I supposed to watch tv?
I know Austin &amp; I have the greatest friends because of the ridiculous song suggestions we're getting for the wedding.

@n_n_nikki oh, and graphic novels.
Austin may not be allowed to move in with me, but at least his books can.
all the books (minus Harry Potter and books by Tolkien... they'll have special shelves). 
combining book collections is no small task. and that's just A-H. 
people "donate" their money to the shittiest causes because of gofundme.
just, ugh.
having to be awake all day has messed up my sense of time.
I am no longer equipped to handle classes that last all day.

@andi_TTSP this makes me feel incredibly lazy.
I always have so many PLANS for the days I have to switch my schedule around, but I just ended up napping on the couch and watching tv.
I still need an ARC of grave mercy to complete my collection. :( it would look so pretty on my shelf.
I feel like I don't know anything that's going on because I haven't had time for Twitter lately. it's been all work and no play for me.

this cake may be a disaster but at least I know Austin will still tell me he loves it.
everything seems 10x louder when you're trying to not wake someone up.
especially when I don't have the right size pan and become paranoid about the pan overflowing.
it's always a little scary when Austin asks me to bake something new for him.
my new mantra for wedding prep: don't bite your nails. don't bite your nails. don't bite your nails. don't bite your nails.
the worst part about making a multi-step cake is having to do dishes in between the steps.

@andi_TTSP yeah, I'm going to need to you to being that chocolate thing back.
some nights you just piss people off and have to let it go.
@staybookish I'm confused by the positioning of these legs...
@nerdherdreads ...to have a vaginal birth after a c-section. to me, it's not any less "natural". you still get a baby.
@nerdherdreads babies' lives, and mommas', are saved by c-sections. I work in a nursery and see it all the time. and it can be dangerous...
@nerdherdreads <POUTING FACE> people need to get over this c-section hate. I hate when moms feel "less than" because they didn't do a vaginal delivery.
@PenguinTeen why choose to write something "weird"? does it take a lot of world building? #KeepYAWeird

REALLY!?
my TB follow-up since I can't do the skin tests was oh so thorough: two questions about whether or not I have symptoms of TB.
@ScottReadsIt I like your thoughts on this subject.
I got Cat! What Is Your Animagus Form? 
again though, maybe I'm missing something here.
I don't think you have to write female (or male) characters to reach an audience of the opposite sex. some authors can and do. that's great.

this is why I shouldn't watch infomercials.
asking me how I got skinny also hurts- I'm working nights and eating less and sleeping more. but none of that fixes the depression.
but guess what? telling me I look good because I'm skinny is NOT a compliment. it only does more damage to my self esteem.
yet these are the impossible standards i have to live up to as a woman.

do I nap before my 10:00 appointment or struggle through and wait to sleep until after?
and it's hard to do things other than read or watch tv and stay quiet while they get to sleep.
sometimes I hate living at home still because my mom always thinks I need something to do on the nights I'm off, so I get a list of chores.
I don't understand why I'm always so hungry on my nights off.

@andi_TTSP ugh. that's stupid. and inconvenient. when we went today they had a closed sign at the passport part so we left.
so I have to have an appointment to get a passport, but the post office never answered their phone to make an appointment. stupid much?

disclaimer about those earlier tweets: I LOVE Christmas you guys. it's my favorite holiday EVER. like I'm holding back my Christmas joy.
@toritellinis all that does is remind me I might not get to see you.
@toritellinis <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
and I'll say merry Christmas when it's Christmas time. but now? happy holidays will do.
saying happy holidays does not mean i'm waging a war on Christmas. I'm just greeting somebody.
@NamasteRead thanks for inspiring my mini rant agreeing with you.
can I start getting offended when people ask "how are you" as a pleasantly without wanting to really know? no, that would be ridiculous.
I don't know a random person's story. why can't I just say happy holidays and it not be a problem?
yes, I celebrate Christmas &amp; am a Christian, but I also acknowledge that holiday celebrations for other cultures exist at this time of year.
before you get offended by those last retweets, hear me out because they're true. it's the holiday season. not Christmas season.
@andi_TTSP I'm not sure! I just saw it and thought "hm, Andi should see this".
@andi_TTSP 
@andi_TTSP it does make you crazy.

(guess my feminism rant isn't over)
my oldest pair of @toms is finally starting to give out. #toms #TOMSPassportRewards 
ugh sorry. rant over.
maybe don't write something saying there are plenty of "easy" girls out there &amp;teaching boys to steer clear when complaining about feminism.
maybe #freethenipple is more about teaching women's bodies aren't inherently sexual instead of shaming the men &amp; boys (&amp; women) that look.
go ahead and teach boys to be chivalrous, but teach them women are equals too. teach them that girls can open doors and pay for meals too.
feminism is still a movement about empowerment and equality. bringing awareness thru #YesAllWomen does not teach girls all men are rapists.
articles like the one I just shared make me angry. feminism is about equality. yes, there may be extremists, but not all feminists hate men.
I Am A Mother Of Two Children And I Cannot Support Feminism
