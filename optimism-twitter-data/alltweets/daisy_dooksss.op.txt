@EsMiaaa you're a boss!! Lol
It's kind of hard to shop when you have a 3 yr. old wanting to play, touch and buy EVERYTHING! Hopefully I'll go shopping on a break
I've been Christmas shopping the past 2 weekends and I'm still not done shopping.
I'll make him buy them since he wants to go too. I'll be like I got Dan &amp; Shay tickets so it's your turn to get tickets. Lol suckerrrr
They're not that expensive but it's at the Filmore so that makes me feel some type of way. Idk.
So I was looking at tickets for Steve Aoki that just went on sell earlier this week and they're $50!! Not buying those myself. Buahahaha
Men are so complicated. Most women are also complicated. But I'm not so stop making it complicated for yourself.
I want bigger, better and different things for 2015. And there's so many things I want. I know I can do it! I always have faith
I'm just ready for all holidays to be over and start 2015 with a fresh clean slate.
I can't believe Christmas is in a couple of days!!
He knows I'm crazy and he loves it. I guess... Lol 
Naomi's with her father right now. Can't decide if I want to sleep or get presents. I still feel like shit
"Eyes on fire" remix by zeds dead is one of my all time favorites! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>

"I see you" by Luke Bryan on repeat til I K.O.
OMGGG STEVE AOKI is coming to Charlotte!!!!!! Oh shit this is gonna be crazy! 
I wish I could just get up and leave. Just Naomi and I. Only way I'll be entirely happy!
I wish I could just change two things with my life and I would be completely happy
I'm about to die and the smell is not even bothering her. Stupid "organic vapor rub" 
Naomi's organic vapor rub smells so fucking bad it's making me sick. Idk how she can stand it
I see this everyday -____- 
Cuddling with the dog because Naomi won't lay down. I can't even with her it's to late for her to be up 
All I want for my birthday is to go snowboarding and to see Parmalee. That's not to much to ask for. &amp; I better get both!
Dylan O'Brien is sooo fine! Maze runner is one of my fav. movies. #perfection #DylanOBrien #mcm 
So I have a pretty good idea of what I'm getting everybody for Christmas!!! Finally put some thought into it.
Eric Paslay January 10th and Thomas Rhett Jan. 30th omg I can't keep up!

OMGG I found it!!!!!
OMG Naomi has a runny nose. Cold medicine ASAP! Gotta stop that.
They always nap together. Rather he wants to or not lol 
Christmas shopping is really stressing me out! Mostly because I haven't done any of it. Lol
She is such a brat and diva. I know it's my fault tho. But I kinda don't mind it because I want her to be picky with most things.
Told Naomi to get something for me and It wasn't there. Then I said "ohh it's on the table" &amp; she rolled her eyes and said I don't want to
I'm a low key hipster. Lol
Texted me mom and she answered my question but keeps texting me. Then says "are you awake?" No I'm sleep texting <NEUTRAL FACE><NEUTRAL FACE>
