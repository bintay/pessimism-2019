@spacedogsradio @alisonrprice @paul_coyle great idea, my vote is for Contact
Btw @Paul_Coyle breaking bad is a slow burner . Takes a couple of episodes to get you hooked
Strangely it has a sound proof room. Handy for our torture sessions
@Paul_Coyle this time last week we were building, but we realised we can't face all those decisions.
We just bought a house. Probably not wise after wine. We are moving to Chelsea (not that one)
@Paul_Coyle we are watching breaking bad at the mo, it's pretty good
@Paul_Coyle watching anything good this evening?

@Paul_Coyle @alisonrprice new yearing in norway this year then returning for 3 days in London

It's a public holiday here today. Who knew. #iworkfromhome
also watched Jarhead last night. OK but cliched war film. Seen it all before.... ooh or am i in the source code!
source code is good/excellent. its like a good episode of STTNG.
Also watched Lemmy - documentary about lemmy - hilarious.
The Greek economic woes are causing a crash in the production of humus and taramasalata. It's a double dip recession!
@alisonrprice I have seen two trailers for that monkey based movie.  One was good the other made me think oh lord!
@Paul_Coyle not seen. Though looks poor. Check out monsters. That is great
@Paul_Coyle what about the adjustment bureau? A bit lovey dovey but quality SF
@Paul_Coyle watching source code tonight. Have you seen?
ooooh sci-fi film fans, looks like we might have a good one coming up 
@richardpbacon I am sorry but that woman on your show is a vile trout.

@alisonrprice @Paul_Coyle @daxy69 just an FYI, have booked my flights for London. Arrive on aug 26 depart aug 29. Hurrah
@alisonrprice DM also I think the current series of torchwood is poor.
@alisonrprice DM of course you are!
TheTdF is over again. That went so quickly. Feel inspired it won't last long.
@alisonrprice how is Liverpool these days?
How
forget the world cup the guardian have produced a hacking wallchart 
wonder when they will bring out hacking top trumps?
@alisonrprice is that near Detroit?

Good day today. Huge day on the Tour, big day in the cricket, also going to be 36 degrees here today
@alisonrprice not on twitter, please.
@alisonrprice are you sure he is not a mass murderer
@alisonrprice are you still up?
Big storm here tonight. No electricity or water now. Huddling round candles and iPhones
@Paul_Coyle it is great tv.  It is just like the wire: corruption in police,media, politicians. The story just keeps giving
@Paul_Coyle the whole thing is beautiful. Is there anyone else left to resign. Cameron should go. Make it so!
@Paul_Coyle  did you hear the London met chief just resigned. #dontgotochampneys
@alisonrprice thanks A am booking flight this week. Think will arrive on the Friday leave on the Monday
@alisonrprice probably all of the above
A Ricky situation! That's something from east Enders I guess
@daxy69 oh god. That is a Ricky situation. A chardonnay Time dilation
Can I still be hungover from going out on Friday? Terrible
Also found out my mate gets prescribed marijuana. He gets it through the post with a receipt and everything. He gets it for insomnia! Genius
Am hungover today. Last night was pub followed by obligatory drunken bike crash on the way home

Listening to the uk parliamentary committee .. It is brilliant. The met are in trouble
@alisonrprice 10 hours is about righ
@alisonrprice well detroit is pretty close to toronto -- and we are an hour's flight from toronto... easy to have a night out

@Paul_Coyle happy Friday night you guys @daxy69
@millarmind just finished your book. It is brilliant. Very thought provoking and eye opening but also exciting and inspiring. Good job.
Some positive news for news international team sky win their first ever TdF stage win.
So hard to be efficient today with both the cricket and the TdF as distractions
@alisonrprice it was quite good all in all. Drank too much of course.
Dear @CometPLC, will you be reconsidering your advertising spend with #notw given that we now know they hacked Milly Dowler's phone?
@daxy69 they are a tad bargain basement!
Happy Canada day! (wtf)

Not a bad Monday. Looking forward to weekend festivities
I know @alisonrprice is in Spain but don't they have 3G there. We need updates. Also Up North Trains Ltd are worried about loss of revenue
@daxy69 big big day when being sober after 3pm is a punishable offence. Beaver tails, moose milk, and bear beer are the order of the day.
at last, a hot day in quebec
Just watched the adjustment bureau. Pretty good. 8 out of 10
Groundhog day 
Public holiday in Quebec today! Vive le Quebec libre
I am on my third night out in a row. This is unprecedented in modern times.
I am out tonight at a film. But alas it's a showing of a renewable energy documentary at the local pub. Special effects?
Early adopter but lazy
Interesting (?) fact, it has been 888 days since my first tweet and this is my 500th tweet. One tweet every 1.776 days.
Today I came to the conclusion that, on the whole, I prefer cake to people.
@daxy69 @Paul_Coyle  ok, that is good VIP material. Though was there enough room for all those zimmer frames
@daxy69 @ @Paul_Coyle  were there any notable VIPs (apart from you two)
@daxy69 wow. Sounds amazing
Just watched "inside job". Another great film but depressing at the same time.
Australian patient found drunk on hospital's anti-bacterial gel

@alisonrprice who are you teaching to?
This is not a metaphor but a deck chair from the titanic  
This was the local cuisine  
This was the view from our cottage 
Back to civilization. The westin nova scotia. Room service on the way. Relief
also, staying in "luxury cottage" with no dish washer, no tv, no washing machine. Am thinking that luxury means running water in these parts
nova scotia is quite nice but there is no phone coverage and no broadband. on the plus side they still have ducking stools and bear bating
@Paul_Coyle I have been banned from all Naked Cycle Rides since the incident
@lolagreen happy birthday to you too, I start the day a little hungover. But that is life at this age
@alisonrprice  
I got an iPad .. Looks really cool so far. I guess it's just a big phone / small pc.
@Paul_Coyle you might have to speak French. If that's a problem just speak german. I doubt anyone would notice. See you Monday. No 1 Ottawa
@Paul_Coyle @alisonrprice for an emporaship you will have to get in touch with LJMU.
@Paul_Coyle I can make you governor general if you like. Basically king of Canada, you would do a good job.

@alisonrprice @Paul_Coyle @daxy69 @NickSmith147 you need to watch exit through the gift shop. Brilliant. Art + entrepreneurship
@Paul_Coyle true. So much dross. Have resorted to documentaries .. Saw one about child molestation last night. Made me cry. Happy days!
@AlisonPriceNCGE  well you are funny but I can't think of a professional one
@Paul_Coyle not seen as heard poor reviews. Bet it was good on your tv. Was there a plot?
Much sympathy for your working day. Here is a picture of my office life @alisonrprice  
It has felt like Friday since Wednesday. What will Friday feel like?
I don't think anyone in Canada follows me but what a disastrous night for the cannucks
I'm using Viber to make free phone calls on my iPhone 
@Paul_Coyle that Is amazing. Who knew there are enough songs in Canada to fill 4 albums
@NickSmith147 yep, to have a successful colony you really need to try and wipe out all the locals. See battlestar galactica
@NickSmith147 singapore? australia, canada, india, usa (OK maybe not the USA)
@alisonrprice pack your things. You're on the street. Nighty night

No Bank Holiday in Canada today. It's a disgrace.
@daxy69 mostly ok thanks. Not running but can walk and bike. Interesting health service experience!
@daxy69 I have tried to this weekend
Great quote from the first half "Ryan Giggs has finally found the anonymity he has been looking for"
@Paul_Coyle received, acknowledged, accepted, confirmed, booked and so on. Why the 3 pm start , is that an age thing?
@Paul_Coyle oooh, to which email address? Can you send to andrew.slavin@canadianclean.com
@Paul_Coyle I know, I am torn
Annoyingly I might have to support United tonight
@NickSmith147 @le_squeak  shouldn't that be John cheese?
@alisonrprice happy birthday alison. What plans for you today?
Just got L.A. Noire. First impressions. Not convinced

At physio and they insist on making me use one of those foot spas from the eighties #domyfeetsmell 
there is something nice about working in a cafe. I dont mean serving. I mean having a coffee & pretending to work (i.e. tweeting)
@Paul_Coyle I was eating a pear. These things happen as you get older.
I just bit my finger. Idiot
@alisonrprice I just re read that .... Wtf?
@alisonrprice are there such things as entrepreneurs is it not just people doing stuff that people pAy for? As opposed to art #controvertial

On the way to the supermarket today I saw a fox and a dead bear. You don't get that at waitrose.
Watching the cup final with an Irish commentary. They particularly liked the national anthem
@AlisonPriceNCGE remember there is no spoon
This weekend watched 'enron the smartest guys in the room' and 'client 9' a doco about Eliot spitzer. We need a revolution. We need aliens
@alisonrprice even better! Scotland looked nice
@alisonrprice that is excellent.
It's actually only a sprain. I am getting no sympathy here. So thanks for the transatlantic empathy
I was thinking of a telethon. With lots of videos of how the money will be spent ... Socks , pedicures that sort of thing
@daxy69 I am after sympathy as have foot in plaster. Maybe they just look like fancy socks
Has anyone seen battle for los Angeles . Might watch that tonight. Watched monsters the other night .. Was very good.
Look at my foot  
@AlisonPriceNCGE nice. Been there a while ago . I remember lots if rain but good booze
@AlisonPriceNCGE nice . Where are you at?
A bad day for Canada.
@climateprogress check out today's miserable national post in Canada suggesting the tornados are in fact evidence of global cooling
@alisonrprice Nighty night
Well I am with you all the way. Awake and in pain and now glued to the news. It's a general election in Canada today.
Also , why you awake?
6 ft 5"
@alisonrprice he was 6th 5 apparently
Orienteering
Just watched 127 hours. Great film. Put my twisted ankle in to perspective somewhat.
Am couch bound with a twisted ankle. To be honest it's not much different to normal life apart from people getting stuff for me
@Paul_Coyle 1997! Ridiculous. Three years before your millennium party! I wasn't even born then
@Paul_Coyle sarah burton is working on my dress. Nothing fancy
@Paul_Coyle greetings people of the commonwealth. London looked amazing today. I am expecting something similar for your birthday.
@alisonrprice they didn't do much about it here in uber French quebec. I followed the coverage by five live and @le_squeak
@alisonrprice well I thought I was above it all but then really got in to it. Made me miss uk. Made be appreciate history, home, London etc,
Cool building  
WTF. He has changed since the cheers days 
@alisonrprice @Paul_Coyle @daxy69 watched trailer of red but thought sleep was a better option.
@Paul_Coyle @daxy69 Have you seen that film Red?
Hello Toronto  
@daxy69 oh yes. And the one about Robin hood. Dreadful .
Watching To be or not to be . Has mel brooks made a bad film?
@alisonrprice that's true. in the uk all pubs are gastro pubs here they are all music venues. It can't be avoided. I am the dad at the back
Band were quite good I think but I was a bit drunk. More jazz flutes needed in this world
The support 
Out on a Thursday night to watch Fred eaglesmith. Ever heard? No me neither.
@Paul_Coyle can you get a sneaky photo?
@Paul_Coyle are you now a train driver?
@daxy69 @alisonrprice alas not buying. Back to looking
@daxy69 @alisonrprice it's now in the future and all about selling sythahol to the borg.
@daxy69 @alisonrprice Have you watched mad men? Watching season 4 at the moment.  Really good
@daxy69 @alisonrprice A dog? Dog's dinner. Rubbish. Badly built . It did have a nice bath though.
We had our new house inspected today. The inspector said run away the house is a dog. V. Annoying. That's the wild west I guess.
@daxy69 @alisonrprice Rough night last night. Ran out of cream at a crucial moment.
Watching mad men season 4.  Really excellent.
@daxy69 Navy or black. Bit hard to tell in the gloom of a Quebec morning #caseofthemondays
New week, new pair of socks
Good grief. It's snowing again.
Just watched Exit through the gift shop. What a brilliant film.
It really annoys me when people who are clearly older use the expression "people of our age" when talking to me. I am not your age!
@Paul_Coyle ok good. I'll be there
@Paul_Coyle I know it is a while away but any plans for the half century. I hope to visit.
@Paul_Coyle great film.
Tonight, pub with simon the window cleaner.

@daxy69 the house is round here ( Quebec). Still being built but looks nice. Room for visitors.
Today I flew back from nova scotia and bought a house. Exciting.
It looks like Plymouth
Halifax is in a different time zone, I am only three hours from the uk!
@Paul_Coyle are you going to the races?
I just put in my ticket application for london2012. If I get all my choices I will be bankrupt but will be in lane 8 of the 100m final.
Ian Beale gives entrepreneurs a bad name, say viewers 
Those sneaky wine people now seem to have 1 litre bottles as standard.

England - snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
Also watching the cricket. England doing their best to recreate Jailbreak the series
Just had my Friday skrumpet. It like a scone. Do skrumpets exist elsewhere?
@daxy69 excellent retro tunes reference
20cm of snow last night. Where is the spring?
@AlisonPriceNCGE no I am terrible but have a lesson once a week. It takes me back to school when I was also rubbish
Just finished French homework. #goodgrief
#spacestation music 101 : you can never over sample the carpenters
@snowflakemaker just listened to four and now am on ( you guessed it) five. I really think you have raised the bar
It's like a concept album by kraftwerk only more spacey and less Germanic
Space station blaring out of the Sonos. It's like being in compass court. Might see if I can get the neighbours riled. Turn to 11
Just checked the post and have new wicked cd from @daxy69 . Tracks selected by @Paul_Coyle Of course. Thanks guys. Rock/dance on
Wine on a Wednesday. Illiterates nicely but doesnt bode well.

@alisonrprice i notice your pm is giving speech today on the 'enemies of enterprise' . An irony not lost on ncge staff imagine
Is it Monday in the uk already?
@Paul_Coyle @daxy69 They really don't do much at all. They just live off all the oil, gas and fish. What else do you need?
tough day at the office 
awake since 3am. BBC to blame. George Galloway ranting on 5live, then a wonderful sounding woman on desert island disks. Will need kip later
Cant believe Ireland beat England at cricket. Pleased I don't know any Irish people. @Paul_Coyle are you Irish?
Charlie Sheen v Muammar Gaddafi: whose line is it anyway? 
@shaunwalker7 Just caught your interview on CBC. Good job. Was that a record for the use of the word penis in an interview. Double figures!
@AlisonPriceNCGE rubbish. Who watches it 24 7?
Cricket on, football on. Coffee in hand. Good morning
Just watched social network which I thought was good . I wish I had kept up with Fortran.
@alisonrprice @daxy69 @paul_coyle you going to any good museums? I like that space one with the big ball thing off central park

Nice view. Welcome to EST. The time zone of the rich and famous
@daxy69 definitely trout breath.
@snowflakemaker  Well, I am impressed. It was also good to hear your voice in our lounge

can I shake your feet?
@snowflakemaker -- I just did it too. Bought lost and found on itunes! Can you sign my mp3 file?
@Paul_Coyle @daxy69 they will surely remake it in Hollywood. Strange as based on a us book apparently
Yes . But she is French in that one. #deceitfulactors
Anyone seen black swan? Supposed to be good. Bonkers but good
Contact. The best home movie experience ever.
Saw a good French film called tell no one. Thriller. Good enough to forget about the sub titles
At least you know where you are with great films like Air Force One
Oh dear. I didn't really get cloverfield. Will try again to make sure we can still be friends!
@Paul_Coyle I am pleased to hear that.  Seen anything good lately?
And this. WTF? 
Highlights included this  
Thought this exhibition at Canada aviation museum looked interesting 
District whatever is quite good.
@alisonrprice shutter island is v. Poor / ridiculous.
I have been very quiet about it know but I have had man flu all week. In fact all family except Adrienne are sick. #longweek
Am at winter carnival in a village called Rupert. It is piss poor. Like something out of Phoenix nights. Have gone for snooze in the car
Rooney just scored the most amazing goal . You will see it again and again and again
@Nils_R Quebec, Ontario or more likely British Columbia .... Rockies and all that
@daxy69  
@Paul_Coyle until the summer when it gets to +40 and it's a mosquito hell. A country of extremes. U moving to Vancouver . More like uk there

Should I get the braces out?
I have a proper work meeting. Not sure what happens in these. Adrienne suggested bringing cakes (genuine). Any suggestions tweeps?
Today, for the first time in about two years, I am going to have to iron a shirt.

@calm_uca are you getting these gems out of a box of fortune cookies ?
Yesterday I ruined a stew. Today I am hoping not to undercook a chicken. I blame the wine.
@Paul_Coyle Are you Chelsea fans excited at the prospect of having Torres ?
Amazing to contrast the optimism of obamas SOTU address with the pessimistic dogma of the coalition.
Today the temp is -25 with wind chill it feels like - 40. You get frost bite after about a minute. It is cold. Anyone fancy a visit?
@alisonrprice @RoyalAstroSoc diapers. The space program developed diapers. Not exactly astronomy but close enough
@Paul_Coyle are there any celebs? Would it be embarrassing to ask for autographs

@Paul_Coyle swot!
It's -25 here in Ottawa (feels like -29) with wind chill. But no worries we are expecting a high of -14.
And another  

@daxy69 Dax is the new Paul?
@daxy69 happy birthday from the new world!
@Paul_Coyle exciting stuff paul. Which institution?
@Paul_Coyle basically too much money, no access to alcohol, ready availability of drugs. Fascinating. Must send kids to school in uk.
@Paul_Coyle they are pretty indistinguishable. I thought Brett Easton Ellis was fiction but it is real
I am still drinking wine and listening to tales of dysfunctional north American families #peopleinthecoloniesareinsane
Welcome to the elevensies people of Britain. Put the kettle on,
Nye with p Coyle 5: can't think but there must have been a garlands/throb involving menthol cigarettes and muffins
Daxy in predictive text is fact. Fact.
Nye with p Coyle 4: the breakfast tv incident. Where did the night go?
Nye with p Coyle 3: wasn't there one time we were in the car trying to find Dax some where near southport?
Nye with p Coyle 2: millennium on south back with fact and alison and pills
Bye with p Coyle 1: night club in Preston. Can't find exit too drunk. Vomit. Find Paul. Leave
Nye with Paul Coyle memory 1:
@Paul_Coyle just finished dinner, kids in bed, traditional orgy about to kick off .
best films 2010 - kick ass, scott pilgrim vs the world, inception
Good tv in 2010 mad men, peep show , Sherlock, psychoville (though may have been 2009)
@daxy69 @Paul_Coyle Have you chaps watched damages? Really good. Watching season 3. I think you would like
those are barmy temperatures for these parts
Finally finished off the Beef Wellington. Pretty good in the end. Looking forward to non-meat based food
I am excited to read that @Paul_Coyle listens to 606.
Now having wine and crackers. Cheers!
Tis midnight here. Happy boxing day. Don't turn the tv on . Breakfast telly is about to start for you
@Paul_Coyle are you now doing an early morning paper round? Can't sleep the cricket is very exciting
@Aggersashes what did Strauss mean by "under prepared" is that a criticism of the groundsman? From andrew in bed in quebec
@Paul_Coyle everyone in bed!!!

Turns out dinner so far is just potatoes asparagus and gravy as beef is raw #shouldhavestuckwithturkey
Beef Wellington 
Thinking of all in the uk this Christmas

I'm tired but will drag myself to the pub tonight #theashes are taking their toll. Anyone else in Quebec interested in cricket I wonder
Hilary Clinton
Our village has a population of around 1000 people and guess who is visiting today?
@daxy69 @alisonrprice Thought inception was good. Clever plot. A good watch.
@daxy69 what's your new address again?
Also, planning to watch inception later . Is it any good?
Also, I don't actually read. Audio books for us with ADD
I need a book recommendation. Anyone read anything good recently. Just read freedom - which was great.
@alisonrprice I look forward to that any time over the weekend
@daxy69 I have seen that film about 30 times. I liked it - not that it counts anymore but the graphics are amazing
@le_squeak hibou
@alisonrprice I don't normally manage 13 hrs in a week these days!

@Paul_Coyle Granville island is the middle of down town

@Paul_Coyle it is a 5 hour flight from me!! Canada is a big country
@Paul_Coyle also vancouver is beautiful but as a city its a bit dull. Cant you get an SF or LA institute interested in your wares?
@Paul_Coyle yes I have, very well regarded apparantly. vancouver in nice (bit full of its own importance). it's west coast but not SF.
@Paul_Coyle hi paul, which institute wants you in vancouver?
the population of qatar is 600, 000. Holding the world cup there is a joke.
@daxy69 you need an excuse to go round. Clingon carol singers are traditional. Hark the herald angel sing - Kaplah
@daxy69 target that emission and fire. #patrickwatch

Very excited to be watching #theashes . Not sure if many people in Quebec are doing the same.
@Pavlovia_Denver thanks

@Paul_Coyle occupational hazard for a giraffe I imagine
Tonight have had wine and would like to be in the company of @alisonrprice @daxy69 and @Paul_Coyle  and of course @le_squeak
Weird not wired. It isn't wired. Dont get me started on Canada telecoms
Canada is wired. Member of the cabinet resigns to join board of bank with pretty much immediate effect. The media doesn't bat an eyelid.
Last night on "up all night" I learnt about the carrington event.... Look it up. Really interesting.
@Paul_Coyle did you not get your share?  Oh well. I'll go and buy another ticket.

one of the rivers ( the peche ) near us

@Paul_Coyle @daxy69 Reading your brilliant SF tweets make me want to live in a city again - or maybe just California
regardless. That is exciting
annoyingly i just read your text about restraining order. Feel the shame
@Paul_Coyle JLP! that is class stalking Paul. Does he still have that injunction out on you two?
@Paul_Coyle is this move timed for my visit so we can throw the sofa over the balcony again!
My  iphone is broken. There are no iphones avaiable in Canada. Nightmare
@slavina @daxy69 @Paul_coyle also how come I'm on bed and your 5 hours ahead

Someone is coming to our conference with surname Boa. What dya think Mr and Mrs Boa would call their finest daughter? Yep, Heather.
Happy Canada day ?!

@daxy69 there hasn't been nearly enough coverage of quake2010. Also have come up against quake snobbery. 5.5? I was in a 6.5 mag"
We just had an earthquake. That was wild and a bit scary
@alisonrprice it's the new dawn. This is us on our own ( and mr tingle, whoever he is)
@Paul_Coyle it's all three. Room for all. Bring your own animal head

@Paul_Coyle that's the fellow. He's actually now moved in. Ok except for his 3 million friends
I should have taken a picture but I was too busy fighting it with a chair
There was an insect in our house today that was so big, if it had been in the uk, it would have been in a zoo.
It was v. Good. The audience were a bit annoying but eddie was great.
@eddieizzard welcome to Ottawa!
Going to see @eddieizzard tonight in Ottawa. I hope he's brought a flag.
@Paul_Coyle I think I have been to genk. It is oldy with canals and cobbles I beleive. You will have a lovely if slightly underwhelming time
Cameron announces first cuts.  'Wasteful and unnecessary' office of Deputy Prime Minister is to go. (via @Aiannucci)

@alisonrprice where are you?
@Paul_Coyle believe it or not the Tories we have here are worse but come any way we live in the socialist province of Quebec
What an absolutely amazing day in uk politics. The Tories must be be livid. Bring on the millibands
@Paul_Coyle dignity! Dignity! It's brilliant
Sky news, Fox news, what's the difference?
Adam Boulton has a break down on sky news -- Alistair Campbell gets another scalp- classic.

@Paul_Coyle last night I dreamt you were going to be pm but turned it down as you had a cough. Is this true? Do you have a cough?
@alisonrprice that helps greatly. Is he as pretentious as ever?
Hello mr president ( of Kazakhstan) 
@Paul_Coyle also I feel I should take some credit as I gave you the invaluable  j-l Picard management book.
@Paul_Coyle don't stop there. I think you should become a lord.
@Paul_Coyle what is this? Prof Coyle with the candlestick in the library? Are congrats in order?
So uk Twitter types how was the debate? I listened on the radio so think Nixon just edged it

@richardpbacon could you do everyone a favour and discuss the legitimacy of the Ppc after their bizarre yet somewhat unsuprising ruling?
@AlisonPriceNCGE are you in the strada at London bridge
