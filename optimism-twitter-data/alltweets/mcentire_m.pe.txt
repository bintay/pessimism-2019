Can someone go get me another reba poster. Same size (bigger then me) it would be great bc I got no moneyyyy thanksssss
Its been 4 weeks ago but I can still hear @reba saying my name. She will never know how much that meant to me.
Done over reacting. (A lot of us do that tbh) but I'm just going to let any "hate" or anger I have to any one go. Life's too short to be sad
Once I start crying that's all I want to do the rest of the day. Probably cried at least 4 times today.
If @kelly_clarkson is pregnant I will cry of happiness. Not kidding. I will die.
Listen to the queen or off with your head<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
Love how @reba is way ahead<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> why? Bc she's queen.<CROWN>
@reba @thebootdotcom YAY!!!! So happy! Miss talking to you! Love you!
What If Kelly is pregnant again? Omg.
I don't eat that but still they feel the need to take my things. Yea I'm over reacting but when I'm close to tears already things push me.
@kelly_clarkson awe:( I hope you get better!! But hey perfection hurts I guess? I wouldn't know.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
like fr this fandom needs to just, idk stop being mean. Can't we all just be friends and get over the past? Fights happen, but come on. Rt

Reba looked fabulous in the leggings. Just saying. #noshame
Was it just me or did it look like at the beginning of reba singing she looked like she had or wanted to cry?
I think reba should take up the whole show singing her whole album. Rt If you agree.<INFORMATION DESK PERSON>

Why haven't I ever heard of dolly/Loretta at these awards
Reba deserves a queen award. Bc she's queen.
When you look back and forth while you tweet bc your scared reba will be on the screen and you will miss it
The celebrities are more excited than the people in the audience they are all dancing and the people in your audience are boring<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
THE WAY HE SAID REBA LOUDER THEN ANY OTHER NAMES. REBA IS SO CUTE DO YALL SEE HOW CUTE SHE IS
REBA IS SO CUTE LIKE I CANT

Wow, I wasn't even excited at the beginning. I miss reba hosting.
@_queenreba even though it don't matter to me bc I'm only watching for reba but I thought Taylor was going to be there
You know, I would quit watching the acms after reba performs but always a change you will see her in the audience. So crapp watching it all
I love Reba's choice in clothing. She shows skin but wears enough where you can tell she respects herself
I know why reba didnt walk the red carpet. She needs a golden one. Bc she's royalty, the queen, duhhhhh<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><HEAVY BLACK HEART><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I have been on the channel for the awards for like 3 hours<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> and I'm recording it

When people hate on reba why does it have to be bc of her age like we all won't be that old at some point. Has nothing to do with her talent
@britt_nich_star @k99online @arayawilson1 and me<INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@arayawilson1 don't you feel the same?

The only reason you hate on reba is because I like her. And I wanna cry every time you don't even know
I hate it when people joke about something happening to reba or asking what I will do. Its not funny or cute. So stop.
Am I the only one who thinks that in "thats when I knew" Rebas talking about getting over Charlie when her &amp; Narvel became a thing? Emotions
I wanna see "love somebody" live so I can clap along in the beginning.
@LouisagoestoTN with her arms around him

When singers change there voice to sound country<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> like I think that was so funny. A girl they call "queen" tried using a fake accent<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@reba until they don't love you is PERFECT!  How do you make your voice getting better and better?! HOW
What I love about "Until they don't love you" is the girl is the bad guy, which hardly ever happens in songs. The guy is always the bad one
I really think @devesteve is amazing. He can see the future. I got until they don't love you this morning<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@devesteve <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE THROWING A KISS> thank you! And same for you! Love you too! Hope you have a good day tomorrow

@devesteve Its not cool to hear it later but thank you for trying to make me feel better<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@LouisagoestoTN how can they judge her when the other singers aren't even country. She has always been singing things like this
I'm like always the last one to hear/get Reba's new songs and it sucks. Everyone posts about it and I'm like "oh that must be nice"
You said you never want to talk to me again but I know I made the right choice

No singer is remotely close to reba. Not even Miranda or Carrie. Not saying they don't have good music bc they do but they don't come close
When you point out peoples typos.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><OK HAND SIGN> 
These new "country" singers talk about how far they have come. Yet Reba had the door open for them when they started.
@xAmberBabyGirlx thank you girl
