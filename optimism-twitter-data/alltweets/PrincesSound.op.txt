Finally done uploading all the Cabaret videos <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
like freaking laverne cox is my queen but still a lot of people don't know about her so it's good that jenner's super in the mainstream
this needs to be normalized and i'm super glad she decided to go public with everything though because now people are forced to look at it
because this needs to be talked about. this needs to get out there so that people can stop basing their trans knowledge on prejudice &amp; myth
but seriously s/o to bruce jenner for further clarifying what it means to be trans and putting it in the spotlight
it's 10:38 on a saturday night and i'm crying over a wells fargo commercial
