Oh @blakeshelton...you've already won me over.  But go ahead and keep trying.
Account was hacked-TWICE! I apolodize for the endless diet tips. No one I know needs THAT.  Next time, I'll get hacked by someone useful.
Listen, Twitter. I don't follow Pepsi or any other company. That means I don't want to see their tweets in my feed. Betches.
@plunderpuss I saw an article about Titan the other day! &lt;3

@mreding11 asked for nothing but @jasonaldean CDs for his birthday. All I'm asking for is @jasonaldean. #sounds fair
@majorcrimes Don't lose the Rusty aspect- I like having him around :) Just watched the DVRd first episode, nice work!

@FLAGALine Just heard "Cruise" on the radio! Leaving a wedding and heading to the after party, flask in my purse #tipitback
Pretty sure is 600 degrees right now. #nojoke
Adding to the list of people it's good to be friendly with....gym manager and drive-through bank lady :) #freestuff #perks

Me, #DMB, and a can of paint. Great afternoon!
@mreding11  
Tanning bed....haha! Love it! 
Nothing like being asked by a random little girl at soccer camp to "wipe her bottom" after she goes "big pooh." #gross
Starting Will &amp; Grace from the Pilot!! When I finish the first six seasons, I'll probably treat myself to the seventh ;)
#favoriteshows
Feeling #blessed. I haven't felt like something happened for a reason for a loooong time, and I'm going to take advantage of it!
@mreding11 is that the only person you feel like punching now? Didn't think so :p
@kunalnayyar who doesn't?!
Calm down, deep breaths...If it's a broken part replace it, if it's a broken arm then brace it, if it's a broken heart than face it.
Just had a HUGE wave of tired crash into me. This could be interesting.
Watching #thecloser always makes me want Reese's and Payday. Well played marketing team.
Definitely earned my Mommy Badge today.
Longest car ride. EVAR. #birthcontrol
I hate when I run out of things to look up on my phone when I wake up. Then I actually have to get out of bed.
@italiainman 
Saw him live in Spokane...he's from Chewelah!
@italiainman Have you heard @allen_stone yet?! AMAZING and playing at #thegorge with @davematthewsbnd Labor Day weekend. You in chica?!

It's sad when the most flavorful part of your lunch is the salted seaweed... 
Somewhere there's a man who doesn't realize just how lucky is to have both his cajones still attached.
Was it REALLY unexpected @chelseahandler? Really...?
Second dream of @EricHutchinson and @KhloeKardashian &amp; sisters! Not sure what my brain is trying to tell me...?
"I was in a tailspin of confusion I hadn't experienced since the first time I heard George W Bush speak." I love you @chelseahandler
For the first time EVER, drove by Joe Jeans and the neon "OPEN" sign is turned off. Hmmm...
I've known for quite some time I've wanted to read a @chelseahandler book. Why and how have I not done this sooner?!? #OMG. #soreabs
Sitting happily in Noodle Express and thought...this could be the site of the next crazy person shooting. Scary. #TheaterShooting
@GavinDeGraw Can we switch jobs for a few days? You can start IVs, wipe bums, and listen to parents whine. I'll swim in that pool! ;)
@adamlevine although I don't technically HAVE my own pool...
Had a dream @KhloeKardashian and sisters owned a Noodle Express and @RealLamarOdom took my order. #crazy
Devastated might be slightly too strong a word in this instance, but not by much...
When in doubt, choose "C"
In Banana Republic downtown....70% off sale. Pretty sure they only let me in bc I'm holding a Nordstrom bag!
Man parked behind me on the street, asked for change for meter...tried to give me a $20 in return! #crazy
My WHITES are now GRAY. This is why I do the laundry, not my boyfriend. #fail
Getting harder and harder to get out of bed each morning...
Running out of excuses to do nothing...
Really. Really. Want. Pizza.
@adamlevine Not at all! Sweatpants and yoga pants are always cause for celebration!

Give me a reason, and I won't break down...I won't break down if you give me a reason, but I got no reason so I'll just break down...
Mani-pedi with my seeester :)
I'm at a payphone.
My awe-inspiring party planning skills and impeccable hostess skills would have made me an excellent high society, rich pseudo-trophy wife.
Not sure why I thought going to the humane society would cheer me up. #bad idea
I've agonized for months. I make up my mind, reluctantly, and suddenly there's something presented to me that slaps my decision in the face.
Sleeping is apparently overrated.
Done so soon? Where's my encore!?!? &lt;3 @EricHutchinson
Welcome to Spokompton, @EricHutchinson!! Excited to see the show tonight :) Be sure to feed the goat at Riverfront Park while you're here &lt;3

The Ancestry.com commercial with Santa actually has a disclaimer at the bottom that says: "Santa Portrayal"
Hate when people tweet/FB how "bored" they are. I refuse...but I find myself full of sleep and seriously lacking of plans for the evening!
Thinking of you with warm thoughts  and prayers! #alicebucketlist
It's a miracle how many times the Krusty Krab gets destroyed and is magically rebuilt by the next episode.

Ran 7.05 miles in 1 hour and 17 mins and felt alright. Meh.  Longest run so far!! 
@plunderpuss That's bc you don't work at a facility that has plenty of pre-made beds in empty rooms. No, I don't work in a brothel...
@plunderpuss I know you're a big procrastinatorface, but I need you to sign that paper and send/email it back please! :)
Can I? I THINK so.  Should I? Probably. #confused
My mood just took the A train to Crapperville.
@LJinman Hahaha! Not true :p

The forecast calls for great sleeping weather :)
@adamlevine I actually laughed out loud when you "cursed" Sting. Thanks fir that.
Here come my pumpkin pancakes!
It's sad how much more motivation I had to run/lift BEFORE I hired a trainer and signed up for a half marathon.
But I get excited about new decorating tips and meal plans...not nude pics.
I can't help but reminded of, and feel like, #adamsandler in Billy Madison when I get to my mailbox and find it's magazine day.
Another early morning tomorrow...too tired to go to bed....
Had to rock the @Nelly_Mo profile pic again.  Good times at Red Robin :)
Can't sleep. Have to get up early for a conference. Did I mention I can't sleep? Ugh.
I think more people need to follow me. Cool people. Ok followers, all 11 of you, reproduce. Replicate. Use your famous people connections.
Sad he's already been adopted :( 
Love @GavinDeGraw's new song! I missed him :)
Nap was worth it. Rocked my world :)
Slept like pooh last night. Should I let myself nap today? Decisions, decisions...

@TheEllenShow My son Gavin doing his best "Pick Me!" face while holding a pet store puppy 
Good morning, Self. Still sick and feeling crummy I see.  Well, cheerio.
In the great and wise words of "Jim"... Rachel. Do SOMETHING. At least try.
Watching "Something Borrowed" and REALLY wishing I had a summer house on the beach...it doesn't have to be in The Hamptons but it'd be nice!
Pumpkin spice or salted caramel mocha? Decisions, decisions...
Pretty sure someone caredully dried my esophagus, covered it in duct tape, and then ripped it off.
Ugh.  This is SO depressing.  Charges filed in 38 pound, starving pit bull case  
I mean, can I really NOT go to @Starbucks on National Coffee Day?
Apparently, the gym is the hot spot to be Tuesdays at 10am. This is ridiculous! In the words of Marty the Zebra, "It's crackalackin!"
I love that the Weatherbug app on my phone shows sunshine with a tiny cloud. It's pouring down rain.
Ironically, I'm driving home from picking up Papa Smurfy's pizza and looking forward to getting out of my tight jeans and into sweats!
Waay too much laundry going on up in here. Up in here. Up in here.
I'm pretty sure Tony Horton can only dream of kicking my butt as much as my trainer just did. Won't be walking tomorrow...
Just realized I got married on this day four years ago.
Feeling lonely and wishing I had cable.
The horse in Tangled is hysterical.
Pretty sure I got bit by a zombie recently.
And now, back to your regularly scheduled, optimistic and perky programming.
