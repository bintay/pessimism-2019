@Dibbs_On_Gibbs  
#GoSpursGo 
Ahh it doesn't feel like it's come to an end.. It just doesn't.
It all goes back to that loss by the Pelicans at the end of the season.. From 2nd place to 6th.. Ahhhhhhhhhhh
CP3 will still retire without a ring
Chris Paul.. I hope you pop your hamstring next week
Fav this if you went for the clippers about to go into a unfollowing spree
#GoSpursGo
We'll be back baby... Nothing to be ashamed of
We're not fucking going down without a fight!!!!!!!!
These Spurs have each others back man I fucking love it
Hang on to the fucking ball!!!!!!!
I swear I've never felt this fucking nervous/anxious .. I'm gonna turn up like there's no tomorrow if they bring home the W
Cmon baby how bad do we want it
Man enough with these fouls I swear
We have to start fucking playing DEFENSE if we want to win!!!!
I'm going to lose my fucking mind.
Lmfao well hey.... #GoSpursGo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@gdowning14 isn't he 6'5?
Lmao bruh people are so childish I swear  
Lmao nooo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
Chip Kelly when asked how close they were to trading up to get Marcus Mariota lmao
Its as if we were driving through a really nice neighborhood saw a really nice house but when saw the price for it decided to stay inthe car
Lmfao nice analogy Chip Kelly
told ya
we getting a corner up next
Absolutely loving @realbuckallen as our pick! His running style reminds me a lot of Arian Foster! @Ravens Good way to compliment @JForsett
I really don't care I just want to watch a good fight.. The last thing I want is for it to be fixed or just a set up for a rematch
Head says Floyd but Heart says Pacman
It bothers me that I'm kind of in a neutral position for tonight's fight.. Like I really want to go for somebody lol
Trade  
We've won twice in LA there is no reason in hell as to why we can't win one more
No choice but to keep our head up.. On to game 7
I'm gonna throw up
Im about to have a heart attack
My heart.. My heart can't withstand a game 7
B E L I N E L L I
Time to play some defense cmon Spurs!!!
We have to close this thing out Spurs lets go!!!!
@h_alanis61 lol love you
draft is over… GO SPURS GO
@h_alanis61 On a Tampa 2 defense.. we could win superbowls (Hopefully you're knowledgeable enough to know the workload of a nose on a tampa)
@h_alanis61 Center? too small.. i think i can take on both Guards and Centers on a double team.. DT would be best
@h_alanis61 Umm the cowboys don't have a very good history when drafting DB's lmao they're gonna regret not listening to me
I guess they've given up on Morris Claiborne
They went corner instead of Safety, EH
I think Cowboys are going Damarious Randall, Arizona State
I like it baby.. Need some speed over the top
Hard to believe we actually not going DEFENSE.. but Peters and Ray are off the board
I think we going WR
Snack for my #Spurs game 
Wow.. God knows who we're picking now..
Learn something Danny Green
BELINELLI
Will change just for my Baltimore pick
Stopped watching the draft.. Sorry guys.. But the Spurs are playing #GoSpursGo
I believe we can even trade up just to get Shane Ray now
@TonyRdz40 Shane Ray &amp; Marcus Peters are both top 10 picks..but they have had issues off the field.. if comfortable, they will take either
I think my @Ravens are salivating for Shane Ray.. can't believe he is still on the board
You're still never gonna get a ring Phillip Rivers
Melvin Gordon.. you should've came to Baltimore… we wanted you.. now you're never going to experience going to the playoffs Yearly..
Lol … …. …. …
And the Browns just broke the streak of 1st round busts..
watch the commissioner fine Danny Shelton for lifting him.. LMFAO
350 lbs to beef up that Interior D-Line..
Danny Shelton to the Browns
Shut up prick you always tweet AFTER the pick  
That doesn't even make sense.. Tre Mason is a stud an has proven he is a 3 down back.. but oh well
FUCK, FUCK MAN.. FUCK YOU RAMS.. STILL WANT MY MELVIN GORDON, BUT YOU DROPPED OUR CHANCES OF GETTING HIM
A few top 10 talent players dropping because of off-field issues.. Shane ray, Marcus Peters..
Although Ozzie Newsome will probably go DEFENSE.. but hey, thats why we still been playing in January for the past 7 years.. #InOzzieWeTrust
I am so happy that Todd Gurley and Melvin Gordon are still available.. still optimistic one falls to my Ravens
Bud Dupree would be a nice addition..
Giants should add a OLB pass rusher..
Lol like seriously, they should  
Idk if you guys understand how bad Chicago's defense is..
Defense wins championships, so yes, if they want to win  
I guess They replace Brandon Marshall.. They really need to spend the next picks on some DEFENSE because it's AWFUL
Do bears replace Brandon Marshall or go CB?
I'm sure they didn't expect Leonard to be available at 6.. Reason why clock time ticked through
Wow... Watch out with that Jets Defense.. Leonard Williams, Sheldon Richardson up front.. With one of the best secondary's now in the NFL
Agh.. Guess jets take Kevin White.. If Gino Smith doesn't succeed with Brandon Marshall and Kevin White I'm going to lose my mind
Washington could've waited for that.. Guess no trade offers
Wow
If Washington can trade down, they will. If not, they'll be more than happy to take Leonard Williams.
Will be available 2nd round, not 1st  
@TonyRdz40 I still have that bitter taste in my mouth, we were suppose to take him.. Maybe deja vu this time around with BAL at 26 &amp; Dal 27
Nice early Christmas present for Derek Carr
He is the most pro-ready receiver in this draft
Oakland takes Amari Cooper.. This one is too easy
No sir, good guess though  
Dante Fowler to the Jags
Sorry, Eagles fans
Titans forcefully take Mariota
They're probably getting calls like crazy lol but guess not good enough offers
Looks like Titans are keeping their pick!!!
I'm gonna be so bitter if Melvin Gordon gets picked before my Baltimore Ravens
Quality family time until the Spurs game gets here!! <DOG FACE><BASKETBALL AND HOOP><MEDIUM BLACK CIRCLE>️<MEDIUM WHITE CIRCLE>️ #GoSpursGo 
#InOzzieWeTrust
@TonyRdz40 Students are more dedicated in UTPA!!!!!
@TonyRdz40 yes lol it's a commuter school so most students drop out or it takes them more than 4 years to graduate
@TonyRdz40 
People partying in the pool on study days at this time lmao.. No wonder we have a 10% 4-year graduation rate

-@Patty_Mills
Cleveland  
@TonyRdz40 he beat up yo momma
Anyhow, can't wait for tonights game!! #GoSpursGo #Game6
Although i would love it to be.. With the 26th pick, The Baltimore Ravens will select RB Melvin Gordon, Wisconsin
With the 26th pick, The Baltimore Ravens will select CB Marcus Peters, Washington
#InOzzieWeTrust

Lmfao 
@h_alanis61 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Ginobili what are you doing
Shit all I wanna know is what Coach Pop told Danny Green in the bench..

Patty man.. You the man, man.
Reasons why I'm not worried about our future  
Lol oh turnovers
Can't remember the last time Green made a 3 for us.. He's suppose to be our sharp shooter
Parker is worrying me, if he's not healthy put Patty Mills in
Cmon Spurs we need this one
I still have faith in my Spurs playing in LA tonight #GoSpursGo
#PrayForBaltimore
@babethegabe_ you can.. it's all in your mind

@alangonzales281 @rickyjr_3 no problem brother you are welcome any time
@1CaptainDrew just get Leonard on Harden it should be a good test!!
@1CaptainDrew I agree bro but shit if we can get past Clippers we can get past Houston.. Clippers have too many weapons
I'm disgusted thinking about how many Houston fans are going to be at the AT&amp;T center in the 2nd round
I think I've become addicted to going to @spurs games, really wish I went today :(
Holy shit there's a shitload of cops all around campus blocking roads

Damn I just woke up from my 2nd nap today
Bradford &amp; Matthews will be used as trade baits..in exchange for the 1st pick from one of the top 6 teams..Then he will draft Marcus Mariota
Woah.... Chip Kelly might be doing something here

READ: 
@steven_leal54 yeah mostly in the defensive side and at running back!! but draft is coming up!!
Now what you really gotta get ready for is playing a NFC East Rival with a pissed off running back twice a year, its gonna be fun to watch
Brandon Carr is making more money than Sean Lee and Jason Witten, Cole Beasley &amp; Scandrick.. Blame the Cowboys for THAT.. Where's the trade?
Why didn't they try to re structure Brandon Carr's contract as he's taking up a huge cap hit? Not like he produced a whole lot this season..
Cowboys knew they were going to lose him and did nothing about it... Period.
The ONLY offer the Cowboys made him wasn't even close to the one he has now.. Fuck is he suppose to do? Just take the spit to the face?
I hate when stupid fans don't understand the business side of football and call a free agency signing a betrayal...

This foreign prof has the thickest accent ever.. I can barely follow him explaining the syllabus
Watch yo profanity
@gregoriotrevino @nfl that's why I'm saying its legal, just wished we would've gone down in a more straight-forward way
@gregoriotrevino @nfl it was just a poor job of letting the defense knw, it wasnt technically illegal cuz they announced it.. Just deceptive
@gregoriotrevino @nfl to the ref and only the ref, then announced it in the stadium like 2 sec before the ball snapped.. Just too late IMO
@nfl make sure they declare them ineligible this time
@nfl old fuck cheating bastard

@rudygarcia_ BRUH URBAN MEYER JUST SAID EXACTLY MY WORDS.. IM SCARED NOW
Scary thing is.. Cardale Jones and Ezekiel Elliot are just SOPHOMORES
One of the best stories in college football.. Incredible season for the Buckeyes that overcame the utmost adversity
Show some pride Oregon.. Lol
These Buckeyes have played with a chip on their shoulder all season and they're now the National Champions
There go your "Quacks"
I fucking love Urban Meyer
Your defense can't stop Elliot and you're down 2 scores with under 8 min left, extremely conservative call that will just end the game early
I picked Ohio St. To win this game, but Oregon please don't be stupid enough to punt
Wow I have never read something this accurate.. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><OK HAND SIGN><REVOLVING HEARTS>
