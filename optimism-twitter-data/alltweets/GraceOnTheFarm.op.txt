@catwytch <WEARY FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><PURPLE HEART>
@Mike_hugs everywhere I turn these days it's either libertarians or white dreads.
@Mike_hugs modern homesteading, bees keeping, goat herding, food coops, farmer markets, chicken ppl? White dreads.
@Mike_hugs unschooling groups? White dreads.
@Mike_hugs crunchy granola attachment parenting mom groups? White dreads.
@Mike_hugs they're so ubiquitous in rad circles here I've had to suspend my general disgust or my kid would have no unschooling friends. <WEARY FACE>
@Mike_hugs they are so pervasive now. :/
Agatha, the survivor, is doing very well. We will pick up some babies for her this weekend probs, so she won't be lonely anymore.
The body of my favorite guinea fowl, Judy Garland, has been found. Very sad but also grateful for closure. <SLEEPY FACE>

@Garden0fsimple same here. ::hugs:: it's horrible. :/
Fucking weirdly racist convo happening between mother and son in this doctors office. Whyyyyyy?
I am definitely expecting horrible news about my bone not healing or something.
At least this means I won't be too upset when I receive likely bad news at my bone doctor appt later.
So many bad things have happened in such a short time that I'm not registering pain anymore. All I have is blistering rage.
I really really need something good to happen. I honestly can't continue if things don't get better. I can't handle this level of shit.
This week has been frustrating, sad and expensive and I seriously can't even begin to process it all.… 
@brassiest def not a good enough reason to suspend your freedom from illegal search. <POUTING FACE>

This fucking week. What fucking fuck for real.
Baby, you're a star. #babysage #baby #babyhood #child #childhood #8monthsold #momlife #motherhood 
@coyote_witch I mean, those are yummy choices.
@bdbreedlove we missed that boat bc colic. That's essentially what the first 6 months are supposed to be like.
... Those of us who have had our bodies stolen and destroyed bringing forth life, well we are fat, ugly and undesirable irredeemable slobs.
I can't even believe this dad bod bullshit though. Dudes are too tired from caregiving to workout, they get a trend piece...
I am 90% sure I just had my first ocular migraine and it was the most terrifying thing I ever experienced. I thought I was having a stroke.
@brassiest Jesus. That's so wrong.
@brassiest and all the feral cats you're caring for? Not cool.
@brassiest it's so dangerous. Like what if someone had their dogs out in the yard when strangers w/ strange dogs came along?
@brassiest yeah def not legal. You can file a complaint if you want to deal with that bullshit.
@brassiest do you rent? If your landlord gave permission, it might have been legal. :/
This is #babysage bouncing in a circle making little piggy sounds. Guaranteed to make your day! #baby… 
Silly #selfie with #babysage. #baby #momlife #babyhood #8monthsold #myface #child #childhood 
@coyote_witch cats probably. Or cum trees.
@caulkthewagon "the greatest generation" were unforgivingly rigid with their kids so I think it was a holdover from that.
@caulkthewagon I am charmed to death by all of Sage's clumsy attempts at things bc trying at stuff is what matters.
@caulkthewagon Yeah mine were hateful too. I think it was a generational thing bc this story is common among gen x and y.
And is there any fandom that been so abused by the creators as the star wars fandom? I seriously do not think so. It's messed up.
I can rent the entire harry potter series and most of the disney classics on amazon, why does star wars think it's so special?!
I don't want to pirate though bc I want a high quality file with features on my big TV.
This is asinine.
But the only option is to buy the DIGITAL COPIES for $90 (or $20 a piece). Like really? This is why people pirate, you jackasses.
All I want to do is rent all the star wars on amazon for a marathon to distract me from the sadness and broken foot.
Haven't eaten since the attack yesterday. Hungry but I just can't. It's been so long since I lost any animals, I forgot how bad it hurts.

There's basically a gaping hole in my chest right now.
For ppl who haven't had birds and don't know how sweet and funny they can be, this feels the same as 3 cats or dogs being killed suddenly.
@Faustrate thank you. I'm utterly heartbroken.
This is what happens when ppl aren't responsible dog owners. I lost 3 birds today and we are waiting… 
Today was the worst day of #farmlife we've had thus far. 10 minutes after I was outside photographing… 
I am so sick about it. Feathers and their little bodies all over the property. It's something out of a nightmare.
Dogs got all our guineas. 2 dead, 1 missing presumed dead, one barely hanging on.
Over the long weekend, I gardened for at least 9hrs. The following is a taste of what I've been up to… 
@coyote_witch I really like sauerbier too, actually.
@brassiest I'm sure you are a huge reason she is doing so well.
I think I'm literally high in sunshine right now? I've spent 2days straight gardening.
@Faustrate they have to come dig them up to transplant them and I have planted some seeds nearby that can't be disturbed.
A couple different things todayhgave gone totally " no good deed goes unpunished" and I'm starting to get irritated.
Do I tell him to fuck off orrrrrr.....? I have shit to do today.
He gave me a window and didn't show up, unbelievably rude. I'm literally giving him $50 worth of hostas (previous owners rly liked hostas).
Trying to give away some hostas but this guy has been a total flake all week and I've been waiting for his ass to show up for hours.
Having one of those days where I wish @catwytch and @coyote_witch were closer bc they would commiserate w/ my omg city ppl problems.
@catwytch thank you
I on the other hand never have to deal w/ her ever again bc she's my dad's sister and he passed a few years ago.
Context: my aunt is sooooo racist and my cousins who are lovely have to deal w/ her still bc she is their gma and MIL respectively.

@catwytch working on his hand dexterity for drumming?
@catwytch oh yeah not easy at all.
@catwytch I was going to get some awesome viking braids and shit going but I just so don't have time.
@catwytch My hair grows fast, I can do this over again in like a year no problem.
@coyote_witch YESSSSS. Get those greeeeens.
@coyote_witch Operation: Goat is in full effect.
@coyote_witch I'm boring, got some debt to pay off and any extra is going to the wood burning stove/barn/fences fund.
@coyote_witch LOL SAME. Down to the depositing today.
Ugggh, I'm over trying to grow out this hair. Now is not the time. Time to shave it all off.
@catwytch it's all good. I'd rather hear about other ppl's problems than deal w/ my own, tbh.
@catwytch me too. I'm sorry. I think the craps are going around.
@catwytch feeling this. I have a broken foot, an eye infection and my IBS was horrible all weekend, but yes. Plants, protests, inane TV.
NOT okay. No.
During my broken foot healing convalescence, I started watching grey's Anatomy and can we just talk about how NOT OK the S2 finale was?!
I would like to package Maggie mae's lethal dog farts and lob them at the police. Wtf did this dog eat yesterday omg.
@NikiSparkles that shit is so many types of gross omg.

Cops in this country are genociding black people full stop. Burn everything down until it stops. Aaaand those are my politics pretty much.

My new indiana parent friends do not know that I have literally rioted in response to extrajudicial cop murders of black people.

Woke up with a stye in my eye. Hoping chamomile compresses will clear it up before I pass it to Sage. :/
@caulkthewagon I will never get the Kim k hate, tbh.
@catwytch like, hell yeah I made detergent and did laundry, 2 gold stars for me, for example.
@catwytch I mentally give myself gold stars for basic adult shit all the time bc it helps in mental/chronic illness land.
@catwytch you def get an adulting gold star for that today.
@caulkthewagon ok, I'm here for any future German needs, lol
@caulkthewagon ja, ein bischen. Warrum?
@catwytch kudos for prepping and preserving them instead of letting them go to waste. That's hard when you feel low, so good job!
@AnarchistPrince SCREAMING
There is just no point. I am too broken and a burden to everyone who has to be around me.
I'm such a fuckup. I work constantly to try to be happy for everyone else despite how difficult just living is for me and there is no point.
Today fucking sucks. I haven't had a chance to eat, I hate this rain, I dropped a dozen eggs on the floor and everyone is mad at me.
@AHealthySlice @backtoherroots thank you! <SUN WITH FACE><GREEN HEART><THUMBS UP SIGN>
@backtoherroots @AHealthySlice Sage is EFF, do these books apply to formula feeders too or just EBF?
That pic of my catnip and mints yesterday? That was lawn 5 weeks ago. Satisfying.
Nothing is more satisfying than tearing up lawn and replacing it with food and herb plants. NOTHING
@backtoherroots the way you feed j solids is how we want to feed Sage. Are there any books you found helpful?

@Faustrate I'm sure these ppl had a serious cleaning crew but can you imagine that job, geeze.
ppl who have updated to OSX Yosemite: mine says it's incompatible w/ Word so wtf have ppl done about that?
@Faustrate the floors were glass mirrors like the walls. Idk how else to explain it, lol.
@coyote_witch @glassresistor fucking ew. <POUTING FACE>
I also spent a day shadowing that girl at notre dame academy in San Jose and that was fucking weird for everyone involved.
(It wasn't that hella mirrors were hanging on the walls but that the walls, floors, ceilings, doors were mirrors themselves.)
Were they swingers? Were they serial killers? Weren't they worried about earthquakes? I have questions.
Even the bathrooms were 365 degree mirrors. Now I look back and realize that was some fucking weird rich people shit.
...the rooms in the house were basically empty besides 365 degree walls/ceilings/floors mirrors.
And we would hang out there a lot bc they had a daughter the same age as me. I thought it was quirkily charming that most of...
When I was a youth I visited family in the Bay Area several times. They had these super rich friends who had a palatial home in Burlingame.

@pinkness I expected gendered clothes being more of an issue as he gets older but straight out the womb, really?!
@pinkness it is quite a ranty subject.
@pinkness so if I want anything science and nerdy it's "boy" and that is so fucked.
@pinkness and of course all the robot/space/science/ocean/dino clothes are "boy" while "girl" is all frills and princess.
@pinkness we want to be gender neutral with Sage but he is in mostly "boy" clothes bc "girl" clothes disintegrate on him and don't fit right
@pinkness omg it's so hard. And clothes. Clothes marketed for baby/toddler boys are cheaper, made better, have longer limbs. Wtf.

@brassiest I spend so much of my days right now just watching the birds at the bird feeder. I'm learning so much about them.
@brassiest It is ridiculous that it has taken a broken bone to force me to finally rest. It cannot come to this point again.
I deserve to take care of myself.
The one thing about this broken foot is I am 100% recommitted to getting fit, doing yoga, taking care of this body I've rode so hard.
@catwytch like, we can acknowledge the universal challenges of parenthood without putting our kids down, damn.
@catwytch or say something like, my kids are having a rough day too, must be something in the air!
@catwytch I share your feels. like, would it really be any harder to just smile and nod and say nothing instead of something shitty?
@catwytch I am also now in possession of melon. Hail.
@catwytch I wish I had the huevos to say that to randos in public. fuck that shit.
I mean OBVIOUSLY she would be better for absolutely everything than Rand fucking Paul but let's aim a little higher come on.
Like, all her platforms scream warhawk and separate-but-equal garbage. I don't get the enthusiasm from folks.
I need all of the "rah rah hillary!" feminists to look at her voting and policy record bc she is rly a conservative step back from Obama.
@brassiest yeah, keeping little people alive is nooooo pressure at all. sure dude, that's totally it.
@Faustrate you will be a most wonderful auntie to all your little niblings.
@Faustrate yessssss.

Been watching a bit of TV being laid up with the broken foot and can we talk about that cute animal android commercial on hulu?! I am dead.
Homemade from scratch guinea fowl huevos rancheros for Sunday brunch today. Endless gratitude to my birds for keeping us in eggs.

I get that cat owners are often in the dark about how horrible declawing is but VETS KNOW BETTER AND DO IT ANYWAY.

@brassiest It's not complete until you MAKE your own kale chips lol
Arnica helps with tissue pain but did nothing for the bone ache, the comfrey zaps it almost immediately. How did I not know this?!
I am so pleasantly surprised to find that comfrey extract zaps the bone pain that no other painkillers touch, wow!
@catwytch The happiest I've ever known you was when you were doing kettlebells regularly. &lt;3 I'll start when I'm not so busted. @brassiest
@catwytch LOOOOOOOL OMG. You have the best stories.
The normal healing time for this type of fracture is 6-8wks, so we'll see if there is any noticeable difference.
Using epsom salt soaks, crystal healing, arnica gel and now comfrey extract while using the boot for stabilization.
Trying comfrey extract aka "bone knit" on my foot. Curious to see if it makes a discernable difference in healing time.
Should have never wasted my time with the journalism degree and just pursued what I really loved: bones.
Feeling a really strong urge to go back to school for osteology. I'm back near my old anthro program and I miss bones and teeth.
An epic fight just broke out between the woodpeckers and the blue jays.
A load of breeds just arrived back for spring this past week and they're doing all sorts of mating displays and territory disputes.
Best part of being laid up with a broken foot is being able to spend all day watching the spring bird drama unfolding at the feeder.
@aGoodTweeter They should be easier to peel and never overcooked this way too.
@aGoodTweeter everyone has! I just learned this a year ago.
@aGoodTweeter bringing water to boil with eggs in it will also keep them from cracking.
@aGoodTweeter And that is how you make perfect hardboiled eggs.
@aGoodTweeter eggs in pan of h2o+salt+vin, bring h2o to boil, hold boil for 1min, turn off heat, cover pan for 10mins, put eggs in ice water
@aGoodTweeter the vinegar keeps the egg together if the shell does crack.
@aGoodTweeter it helps keep the shells from cracking. I put both vinegar and salt in the water.
@aGoodTweeter oh woops, that's for hardboiling, do not with the salt for poaching!
@aGoodTweeter also like 2tsp of salt

@chaos46692 NIIIIIIIICE
@brassiest but oil cleansing blasts the crap out of your pores and truly removes the makeup.
@brassiest if it is had sls or shit you can't pronounce, get rid of it.
@brassiest the castor oil is what actually fights the acne, so it's not just any old oil. Jojoba is a good carrier oil though.
@brassiest no cleansers. the "oil cleansing method" is no soaps. It's hot water, light exfoliation and oil.
@brassiest noooooooo
@brassiest adderall will contribute to acne as well bc of dehydration, so drink lots more water on adderall days.
@brassiest SOAP IS RACKET. It fucks up the natural flora of your face that keeps everything balanced so you have to buy more soap.
@brassiest And if you don't have time to oil cleanse your face, it's just better to do literally nothing than use any soap.
@brassiest NO SOAP. STOP ALL SOAP.
@brassiest google the oil cleansing method and do it with a combo of castor oil and sunflower oil.
@brassiest stop all soap on your face and sls in your shampoo

@coyote_witch i'm sure you already know that vegetable sources of iron are easier to absorb than meat anyway.
@coyote_witch I reeeeeally like fake meat. I rarely miss the real thing unless we're talking about venison or something really unusual.
@brassiest I'm going to look at that every time I start feeling down about my foot, thank you.
@brassiest IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER OMG
@brassiest that is a looooot of pet bunnies, lol.
@brassiest eeeeeeeeee!
Can you tell which one is broken? :'( #brokenbones #sad #injury #farmlife #fml 
@coyote_witch Maggie does that with miles and actually caught one once, had no idea what to do with it.
Finally picked out a #highchair so #babysage is enjoying solids. This week: bananas. #baby #babyhood… 
@backtoherroots what about your knee? knee injuries are tough. :(
@backtoherroots it could be worse, i keep telling myself.
@backtoherroots the urgent care ppl estimated 6-8 weeks but i see the ortho tomorrow. It's a hairline fracture, so probably no surgery.
@backtoherroots Can't farm, can't clean, can't take care of my kid who is so extremely demanding. Just take me out back and shoot me.
@backtoherroots That is such a bummer! idk how I'm going to put my garden in this year now. I'm just devastated.
@catwytch oh the epsom salt and sandalwood just knocks me out. I also always use a dream time melt.
@catwytch avo bomb is almost identical and is just as effective if you didn't know.
@backtoherroots but now I'm covered in bruises from running into things, I'm always knocking things over and falling. I don't understand. ):
@backtoherroots I was never clumsy before this. I did yoga for 16yrs, I've never had a broken bone worse than a toe or finger.
@backtoherroots do you have a garden caddie? A little stool with wheels basically. Would that help you get back in the garden?
my whole body hurts from that fall earlier, damn.
@brassiest thank you and you always have my consent for anything like this. &lt;3
@brassiest please do. I am dead serious that I think I'm fucking cursed. This shit keeps happening and I'm about to cash my chips in.
The stupid thing that is really getting to me is that I was so stoked to go morel hunting this year and I FUCKING CAN'T AGAIN.
What's the fucking point, jesus christ, I cannot catch a goddamn break.
In a really bad place. Was already teetering on suicidal again earlier this week, so now I'm laid up yet again and want to die.
Yep, def broken. Brb throwing myself off a bridge, bye. #brokenbones #fractured #fml 
I seem to have been cursed. If you are a witch displeased with me plz let me know how to make amends.
At urgent care with a possibly broken foot. Couldn't have come at a worse time. Fml 
Pretty sure I broke my foot, going to the er, fuck my fucking life.
#babysage's first look at dad's fresh face. #baby #beardlife #dadlife #babyhood #child #childhood…

@coyote_witch what are you watching?
@backtoherroots sorry for the loss of the little one, so glad the rest are great though. :)
@coyote_witch aw, I am sorry. A good long life, loved, and a compassionate end of suffering is the best anyone can ask for. &lt;3
Psychedelic bab after helping me garden in the rain. #baby #babysage #child #childhood #babyhood… 
@backtoherroots how are the chicks this morning?
@backtoherroots no, i was in california. I missed the horrible floods the summer of 2008, too.
@backtoherroots Everyone is so chill about earthquakes out there and i'm like THE EARTH IS SHIFTING. BRIDGES GET KNOCKED DOWN. WTF
@backtoherroots Like, give me a hurricane or a tornado any day bc earthquakes are a NOPE NOPE NOPE for me.
@backtoherroots It is perfectly sensible to be alarmed by tornados. I lived in cali for 7yrs and was TERRIFIED of earthquakes.
@backtoherroots I do think your fear is more common and normal if that's any comfort.
@backtoherroots that must be horrible. I'm so sorry. :(
@backtoherroots I definitely get that. I grew up in Hope with @blessmessblog and have lived through many tornados.
@backtoherroots yeah, one of our trees got hit in the woods tonight, I was momentarily deafened and blinded so i scooted everyone downstairs
@backtoherroots It's a borderline religious experience for me personally, though, like touching the abyss.
@backtoherroots I am a somewhat insane stormchaser type, but I get the fear. Storms are powerful and that power can be dangerous.
@backtoherroots This is a wild system going through tonight!
#babysage's first #storm. Mighty Thor struck his anvil and we rejoice at #spring! #dadlife #baby… 
(Turn up volume) watching the first serious #storm of the year blow in. #indiana #spring #farmlife… 
@coyote_witch babies are all the same size at this age, wtf wtf wtf.
@coyote_witch we try to keep things gender neutral but the clothes marketed to girls have 2 inch shorter sleeves!
@coyote_witch wooooooooooord
Why does #babysage look like a teenager here?! #baby #child #7monthsold #farmkid #farmlife #latergram… 
Hard to get a clear shit of #babysage these days bc he is always in motion! #baby #latergram #child… 
#babysage needs no help bouncing anymore. #baby #7monthsold #spring #momlife #dadlife #activebaby… 
Everyone just got so lucky none of then got eaten or ran off omg.
HEART. ATTACK.
OMG the wind blew open the barn doors and the chickens/guineas were running around in the woods in the storm!
@majtom2grndctrl that is very aptly put.
And whether you believe it it not, that sort of random generosity and pleasantness is the rule, not an exception, around here.
Indiana is such a hellhole of horrible people that Ben got $20 worth of fresh fish for free today bc he had the cute baby with him.
@majtom2grndctrl seriously. And some of the worst offenders were/are rads and anarchists who should know better. Fucked up.
@backtoherroots happy to help! I'm going to have a million questions for you when we get our veggies going for sure. :)
@backtoherroots even though I'm off fb, I still have messenger on my phone if you want to chat about chickens! I'm excited for you.
Just, A+ ally-ing there, dudes. Well-done. Allied so hard you're running queer hoosiers off of social media. Fucking neat-o.
Yes, I was def just run off facebook because ppl I thought were friends refuse to stop spreading hateful misinformation about my home.
So there's clarification for the people who are quietly peeping my twitter looking for answers.
Yes, I rage-quit fb tonight. Yes, it was because the endless stream of hateful bullshit being spewed about Indiana and ppl who live here.
@coyote_witch PARTY FOUL.
@brassiest dm-ing you.
Like, if you don't live here and you have something fucking clever to say about #RFRA, go check @Shakestweetz out first. #BoycottIndiana
I need ya'll to go follow @Shakestweetz so I don't have to keep retweeting her entire timeline.
@backtoherroots me too.
@Shakestweetz I feel like having mother bears in Bloomington cater my vow renewal just to fucking spite their classist asses.
@Shakestweetz OMG I have had this conversation a couple different times today, like we don't have some of the best pizza on the planet here
I have never seen so much hate spewed about any other state's fucked up laws. It's ignorant, classist shit and I am just heartbroken.
I participate in social media to keep in touch with friends mostly in Cali but I'm beginning to wonder if most of them are actually friends.
I'm starting to get anxiety attacks every time I open fb/twitter bc I don't know what sort of shit ppl are going to be talking re: Indiana
#babysage finally fell asleep watching old Buster Keaton films. #baby #dadlife #child #childhood… 
@caulkthewagon I've lived in Indiana most of my life and have never heard of walkerton. Gonna have to google.
@coyote_witch eat some Dong for those of us poor, Dongless souls.
@brassiest what colossal douche.
@brassiest wooooooooow
@hostilehottie yes, that is correct.
@catwytch it's a cute little jumping one, good taste E.
In the middle of a major sleep regression and teething and we all have colds, #babysage finally… 
@coyote_witch plz slap them for me thanks.
@catwytch oh god no.
@Faustrate Like, there is a lot to skewer her about in the post but I keep seeing ppl making light of her perinatal mood disorders.
@Faustrate Being scolded by strangers while pregnant, especially about caffeine or what we eat is a pretty fucked up universal experience.
@Faustrate Sorry if this seemed targeted towards you. &lt;3
@Faustrate I didn't see you say anything about it. I did see a bunch of people calling her a hormonal bitch though and that was fucked up.
@catwytch That makes sense. There's a sudden peace about embracing the void. "Queering" gender always felt like such a performance to me.
No part of my anatomy or mental world is gendered anymore, not even queered. Gendervoid is also close to accurate.
I am genderless to the point of feeling total alienation from the world of gender, much like my alienation from the world of time.
I think a more accurate gender identity for me is apogender as opposed to genderqueer, which I have been identifying as for a decade.
Shoutout to ppl threatening to assault a woman who was afraid of getting assaulted in a nghborhood i left bc i was tired of being assaulted.
Hahaha, she was sick, sad, alone and scared and wrote about it when she had healed what a fucking bitch, amiright?!
...and it turns everyone is making light of her trials with perinatal mood disorders in a hostile area, alone with no friends.
Read that article about hating-loving Oakland that everyone is making fun of...
@catwytch @coyote_witch @brassiest @aGoodTweeter
OMG, daily med taking friends check this out: 
@aGoodTweeter wealthy blue state people who are telling us we should move/be nuked.
@aGoodTweeter queer Hoosiers like me are begging for no wholesale boycott bc Indiana GOP doesn't give a fuck and the call is coming from
@aGoodTweeter normally I agree with this but in instances like the boycott of Israel, the victims are calling for the boycott, whereas
@coyote_witch you better believe that when we start traveling as a family, I'm getting a selfie stick so I can actually be in photos.
@coyote_witch yep, only one crappy pic of myself at my number one dream destination.
@coyote_witch yeah I don't get the hate. I used to be a solo traveler and wish I would have had a selfie stick at Angkor wat, etc
@bdbreedlove found this bookshelf tossed away on the side of the road 9 months ago and we finally got… 
@catwytch trying to overcome my anxiety about that shit too bc Sage needs to be around other kids. :/
@brassiest I am dying omg
@brassiest "it's not a trick, it's an ILLUSION."
Pardon me while I go drink an entire bottle of wine now and watch trashy TV bc the world is too sad and scary.
A truly horrible thing happened in my local mom community and I am just so sad tonight. Not going into details bc triggers but it is so sad.
@coyote_witch i have done this thing

@Mike_hugs we live in the touristy part of IN and I haven't seen a single biz of any size stupid enough to support this bill.
@Mike_hugs Indiana follows the money. If the money goes to queers, the tides will change.
@Mike_hugs i hate to be all the about the money, but indiana is broke and our orgs are broker
@Mike_hugs (Indiana GOP are funded by the big prisons in Indiana.)
@Mike_hugs funnel money to indiana lgbtqia orgs and queer student orgs and prison abolitionist orgs
@Mike_hugs doing a little research to support queer-owned and inclusionary biz in indiana, visit us during leaf season+search out those biz
@Mike_hugs queer Hoosiers like me are begging for no wholesale boycott bc pence won't feel it, we will.
@Mike_hugs difference is Palestinians and S Africans under apartheid call/ed for it while the call to boycott indiana is coming from outside

So much good advice, I don't even kno…
#BoycottIndiana hurts actual queers who live and work here. We are already being punished by our state government, don't make it worse.
@coyote_witch yeah that's pretty accurate.
@coyote_witch woooooow
@coyote_witch I don't get this reference.
I'm worried that my queer friends who survive via their etsy shops are about to be screwed by #BoycottIndiana.
@sex_ational they are bad all over here too. I am extra paranoid with the kid.
I worry that everywhere else thinks there are no queers here and no queer run biz. You are mistaken. Plz don't punish us. #BoycottIndiana
I get why the country wants to boycott big things in Indiana but plz plz plz do not boycott small biz here. #BoycottIndiana
@sex_ational what state are you in?! I thought it was too early too :(
@sex_ational fleas. Ticks and fleas, man.
I've had this #castiron griddle for a week and I can't get enough! Pancakes and hoe cakes are so easy… 
I am going to somehow carve out time this weekend to write something public about the myriad ways Pence just seriously betrayed me and mine.
My dad campaigned so hard for him when he was first starting out, god damn it.
I am from Mike Pence's podunk little hometown. I went to high school and did 4-H, FFA with his family members.
GOD I AM SO FUCKING ANGRY. The more I think about this shitty bill, the angrier I get.
#babysage happy to be standing up with no help. #baby #child #7monthsold #teething #momlife

@moonandserpent yeah, def would not have bought property here if this was a thing 2yrs ago.
Woke up with migraine. Today is already fucking awful.
@coyote_witch Part of it is so many ppl have scheduled c-sections now+don't share their birth stories, ppl don't understand natural labor.
@coyote_witch oh my god. this, though. THIIIIIIIIIIIIIS
I may be completely run ragged but my kid freaking cracks me up. He is so damn funny.

@glassresistor thank you. I know you have experienced this shit a lot too and it sucks.
Do you need to see my lifetime sex scorecard? Do you need my gender dysphoria spelled out for you? FUCK OFF YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING PAPERCLIP
YOU GATEKEEPING FUCKS
Why did I marry a cis man? MAYBE BC HE ACTUALLY GROKS MY GENDER AND SEXUALITY AND WHO I AM AS A PERSON AN IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
I am not straight. I am not cis. My gender and sexuality are not contingent on who I am currently monogamous with.
I think bc my relationship looks het from the outside even ppl that know me really well forget that I am queer.
Ugggh, ppl are rt-ing me and I don't like it.
Between the RFRA Bill and this Game of Thrones bullshit and not eating today, I am in a super shitty mood.
@brassiest yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This shit could have been avoided.
@Mike_hugs @brassiest The producers know the basic plot as insurance in case GRRM dies, so if they know, he knows.
@Mike_hugs @brassiest i'm confused. I haven't watched the last season of the show and it's been a couple years since I read the books.
@brassiest I'm a writer, I know how hard it is but fucking come on, dude. Knowing the plot is the hardest part of the whole fucking thing!
@brassiest GRRM knows the story, knows what's going to happen, how he wants it to happen, just sit down and write, damn it!!!!
@brassiest Yeah, this is a pretty obnoxious thing. I don't even understand how this is happening.
@brassiest NO

Bad science yo, baaaaaad science.
I have a lot to say about that fucking Brazilian breastfeeding vs formula/IQ study. And none of it is pleasant.
@coyote_witch @AnarchistPrince @Faustrate a good morrow to you all!
@coyote_witch @AnarchistPrince @Faustrate welp that typo made that tweet unnecessarily lewd, but I'm keeping it!
@coyote_witch @AnarchistPrince @Faustrate alright, all, I'm going to fuck to sleep now. Good night!
@coyote_witch @AnarchistPrince I was telling derek earlier that we already plan on putting a mini-rock wall in his room when he's older.
@coyote_witch @AnarchistPrince yeah, i am so looking forward to that. "here kid, pull all these weeds, pick up all these walnuts..."
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince sage and liz will be bffs someday, I do believe.
@AnarchistPrince @Faustrate yes, and that is just fine. His forehead is solid, he doesn't even notice, lol.
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince he has a pibble forehead though. I don't worry when he bangs the front of his head, lol.
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince he doesn't have the coordination for what he's attempting and the back of his head is still pretty soft.
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince he is actually really tall for his age and likes to faceplant on walls, knobs, molding, etc
@AnarchistPrince @Faustrate It was soooooo sweet. He laid his head on my thigh while banging on this percussion toy.
@coyote_witch @AnarchistPrince Sage has never had that phase. He went straight from colic to rolling to crawling basically.
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince ...He sat on my lap playing w/ new musical instruments for 20mins today which is a bit of record for non-eating.
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince We are trying to make sitting about a little more interesting for him...
@AnarchistPrince I have sympathy for my mom now bc I was a maniac like this too, lol.
@AnarchistPrince we're def going to put in a mini rock wall in his room when he's older.
@AnarchistPrince It's cute and amazing but completely exhausting. He is 300mph 24-7, barely sleeps.
@AnarchistPrince yep, sage is climbing, like everything is a rock wall.
@AnarchistPrince we're considering getting him a helmet, tbh.
@AnarchistPrince And he doesn't have the coordination to deal w/ falling from that height so our nerves are fried after just one week.
@AnarchistPrince I have never heard of a kid younger than 10 months bypassing proper crawling and going to straight to standing/walking. &gt;.&lt;
We are definitely in the weeds on this one. No one has any advice bc wtf is a 7 month old doing trying to walk?!
Having a hard time dealing with my 7 month old pulling up to standing and trying to walk. Just like...how...?

#babysage pulling up without help. #baby #child #7monthsold #momlife #microfashion 
Putting a mat directly on the floor basically, bc I feel like that's the safest choice.
Just ordered a transitional bed for my unreasonably advanced baby bc he is pulling up to standing already.
Heeeeey if you're in North America, tonight at around midnight wherever you are is the best chance ever to see the aurora borealis.
@aGoodTweeter I keep telling him that he can chill out a little on blasting through milestones but he doesn't listen, lol
@aGoodTweeter I knooooow. I can't believe it! He is starting to stand up on his own, basically a toddler already!

@aGoodTweeter Even if some MI are caused directly or indirectly by capitalism that still doesn't mean they are a "social construct."
@aGoodTweeter The "MI is social construct" opinion is worse than garbage. It's obnoxiously simplistic and patently false.
@aGoodTweeter ....and a lifetime dedicated to studying shamanism, etc.
@aGoodTweeter ...caused at least in part by capitalism. But it is a very nuanced convo and my opinions are informed by an anthro degree...
@aGoodTweeter I believe that many MI, and def mine, are exacerbated by the toxicity of capitalism and some, like many cases of PTSD are...
@aGoodTweeter though, I do have *THOUGHTS* about the intersection of mental illness and capitalism.
@aGoodTweeter uggggggggggggggggggggggh. I don't follow any of them anymore.
@aGoodTweeter Feeling everything you're tweeting. &lt;3
@pinkness sounds like nap time to me!
It's the little things. Like using rebellious patchouli soap after mucking the winter coop.
Using a new patchouli soap today and feeling subversive, lol.
Every time I use patchouli scented anything, it's a tiny act of rebellion bc my mom despises patchouli and never let me have it as a teen.
Being able to hop out of bed in the morning and do hard work makes me as giddy as a kid on Christmas.
This work gives me a reason to get up in the morning, to live, frankly even more than my kid, tbh.
But truly, this farm is hard work that's only going to get harder but I love it. Every bit of hard work just infuses my body with life.
If anyone had told me as a sad midwest teen that I'd be calling southern Indiana paradise when I'm 30 I'd have punched them in the face.
Winter is the tax we pay for living in literal paradise for over half the year.
Every winter, there are several times when I wonder why the fuck we moved out here bc it's terrible and then spring hits and I remember.
@Mike_hugs @Faustrate yeah, the nazis def won against the Poles. Anyone questioning that is not in any way Polish or Jewish.
@catwytch ok! Keep an eye out for the mail today!
@catwytch yes I know Sunday is weird but Amazon has a pact with satan
@catwytch physical mail. Should have arrived yesterday.
Mucking the #chicken coop in my new muck boots, much cuter than any muck boots I had as a child!… 
@catwytch have you checked your mail recently?
@catwytch I last about 10 minutes w/ nausea before I'm begging for zofran despite all the horrible side effects.
@catwytch Nausea is the number one worst sensation, IMO. Like, I can take pain any day. Natural birth was whatever, but nausea NO.
@catwytch I know these feels.
@AnarchistPrince @Mike_hugs oh mah gaaaaawd
It's kind of sad how much grocery shopping wrecked me. I am sooooo not used to being around people, lol. I am giddy to be back at the farm.
@pinkness I've been thinking about you and sending light to your situation throughout the day since yesterday. &lt;3
@pinkness You are inspiring in every way and I hope you can feel the warm ball of calm love light I'm sending your way.

I need approximately 6 months of this weather, thank you and good night.
@blessmessblog yep! I use cumin and garam masala (which contains cumin) in everything!
Getting on that sustainable mushroom cultivation wagon. Yessssssss.
I think it will be an early mushroom season. Looking forward to being able-bodied enough to really hunt for morels this year.
Gorgeous weather today. All the little plants are popping up out from under the fallen leaves even though there is still snow here and there
On the blog, today's featured photo, a Missouri trainyard. 
#babysage has been extra snuggly lately. I love it! #baby #infant #child #momlife 
@aGoodTweeter I know it's nearly impossible to find accessible chiro work, though. :(
@aGoodTweeter ...Over time, getting popped will properly shorten the connective tissues and it will stop happening for good.
@aGoodTweeter :/ If there is a chiro school or clinic nearby I would really suggest going and getting it popped back in...
@aGoodTweeter This keeps happening to my husband, too. are you able to go to the chiro? It is the only thing that helps him.
So, I'm gearing up to watch the pilot so I can know wtf I'm actually talking about, but I expect it to be kind of horrible.
My lingering trauma and mental brokenness from being raised in a cult is not a fucking punch line and it's not quirky/cute.
If it's punching down at survivors of brainwashing, which I suspect, I am going to light the internet on fire.
I just have this feeling that that unbreakable whatever show is really going to tick me off.

You're a hypocrite for changing ideas and a fraud for not changing soon enough. It's fucked and it's REALLY American.
If you are integrating new info and changing opinions, you're shit on from both sides.
I don't know why American culture is so heavily invested in stubbornly sticking to your guns on something despite new info being presented.

Integrating new information/experiences and reorganizing our opinions as a result should be welcomed instead of shitting on ppl for...
As we dismantle the systems the intersectional forms of oppression, we need to stop being assholes to ppl as they grow and change opinions.
Indiana used to not be a daylight savings state and I miss that. Let's just be rid of this plz.
@Faustrate the same thing happens to me! Longer hair looks so not femme on me.
There is no point in putting socks on this kid. #baby #babysage #child #6monthsold #momlife… 
@brassiest BRUUUUUH
@brassiest lolwut
Is there a way to mute certain tags on here?
This day is just interminably slow.
EVERYONE IS SO BROKEN ::cries a river of tears and drowns in it:: #BSG
Like, BSG is sooooo fucking good and thought provoking and heartbreaking and complex world building and ugggggggggh
Opinion to piss off all nerds: The Battlestar Galactica reboot is far superior to Star Wars OR Trek. Fight me.
This amazing thing happens about once a day, #babysage entertains himself talking to the wall decals.… 
@outmouth I would like to retweet this 300x
I'm jealous of ppl who can love themselves at any weight but I hate everything about my body, so. Fatter=more gender dysphoria for me
So tired of hating what I see in the mirror. I feel like I should apologize to everyone who has to look at me bc I look so bad.
Idk how it's supposed to happen w/ the demands of my life but I have to lose weight. I am so disgusted with myself.
@brassiest "i've done what I can. those weird puppies need jesus."
@brassiest pretty sure maggie spends her whole life concerned about how bad we are at being dogs. Just like "geeze, I hope they're alright."
Always leave the pediatrician feeling like a colossal failure. Yeah my life is a wreck and it keeps me from being a good mom. A+ self
Wake me up when teething and vaccinations are over and I have a playful 5yo who can entertain himself for 15mins at a time.
Trying to stay positive but it sucks when you can tell right off the bat it's going to be a shitty day.
@catwytch I'm definitely doing this this spring. We gave accumulated so much junk since we moved here!
@catwytch yooooooooo
#babysage helped me in the kitchen today. #baby #infant #farmlife #momlife #child #childhood 
@coyote_witch WELP
.@moonandserpent Yes. I'm finding more truth and communion in my son's babbling than in anything anyone else has to say.
I honestly can't stand it anymore. I'm happier and happier the less I spend in physical and digital spaces of talking talking talking.
There is just too much talk. How can you hear the trees speaking to you, the voices in the rain and the snow, with this constant chatter?
@glassresistor It drives me up the fucking wall.
#Sunset through our #woods. #winter #snow #nature #farmlife #farm #rural #country 
The #trees are waking up. #spring is coming. #nature #woods #farmlife #farm #rural #country #winter 
@AmberAnklets thank you
@AmberAnklets already have one. Doesn't do shit but look pretty and further irritate him.
ooooooh down for a 20 minute nap and woke up screaming. It's going to be that kind of day. T_T
NOPE. THEY NEVER COME THROUGH. This is has been happening several times a week since he was 2.5 months old omg.
Every few days he has a horrible nightmare of a time with mouth pain and we're like this has to be it, they're coming thru this time.
I've never heard of a kid TEETHING FOR 5 FUCKING MONTHS WITHOUT THE FUCKING TEETH ACTUALLY COMING THRU OMG KILL ME
Stretchy? Made to survive tough use? Cute and colorful? Only soft cotton and fleece? Roomy? Form AND function?
Honestly, I'm just going to start dressing myself using exclusively the same rubric I use for picking out Sage's clothes.
No itchy tags or anything irritating at all.
I want all of my kid's clothes. They are all cute and soft/stretchy/made for movement/lots of room in the butt.
Jealous of my kid's soft, comfy, baggy, grey sweatpants, tbh.
@catwytch omg, Sue has basically the same story from when Ben and Nick were kids about her drawing a cow.
Heart weary, body rebelling, don't think I can handle the world beyond my beautiful little bubble over here. Raw survival is good sometimes.
@brassiest UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH
Hoping this quiche I threw together tastes as good as it looks. Trying to cook my way out of this… 
@glassresistor @OaklandElle too soon
@soycamo i mean, it was hundreds of pounds of wet snow out of nowhere last night, so it was a surprise.
@soycamo aluminum roofing is WAY out of budget right now. We will be putting up better support this time around though.
Officially over winter. The heavy, wet #snow completely destroyed the chicken fortress last night.… 
@brassiest yes! Could be way worse. They are 100% fed up with being stuck inside though.
@brassiest probably a full day of Ben and my brother working
@brassiest yeah, they are in the barn for the winter but it's about to warm up and the birds have to be moved outside when that happens
The chickens are inside the barn right now but it's still a massive bummer. Got to get it fixed immediately as it's warming up in a few days
Uggggggh, the roof of the chicken fortress collapsed under the weight of last night's surprisingly heavy snow.
Just picked up and finished this cross stitch that has been sitting idle for 25yrs. I love this… 
@brassiest for the seed, I don't get a better number or variety of birds than with just straight sunflower seeds.
#babysage with his nana! My mom also taught me how to hand sew in a much sturdier way than I knew… 
@brassiest birds can't resist plain sunflower seeds and berry-packed suet. That has been my experience.
@icannotpaint tbh that album is way underrated
Read my review of this ultra sweet #Riesling at the blog: 
@icannotpaint I can relate to all of these tweets. You are not alone in the sheer diversity of depression symptoms. &lt;3
This week's Weekend Wine is a very sweet Riesling from Oliver Winery: 
@coyote_witch "so first you walk to your own desk where your computer lives, open chrome, type in google maps..."
@brassiest I FEEL YOU. When we dig a little pond and have a baarn, we are totally getting them. Prob next spring, tbh.
@catwytch I miss seeing pix of her, though. Plz text me some now and then. They are safe with me!
@catwytch ...the internet so I can't exactly go offline. And I have no friends irl, lol/cry.
@catwytch I'm having hardcore "run into the woods and be a luddite viking witch" feels but our farm biz model will rely heavily on...
@catwytch i'm going to remove all photos of sage when i have a minute this weekend
@catwytch i've had about enough of tumblr tbh. It's getting overrun w/ pedos, nazis, terfs, etc
@catwytch I'm in KKK country so I don't dare try to go find a local norse pagan group, ha.
@catwytch Is white supremacy inherent to the religion? I feel like you'd know better.
There's this amazing shaul/duster thing on etsy but the sizing is so weird, i messaged them, now waiting impatiently for answer. No chill.
@glassresistor Jar Jar Binks is completely irredeemable though, for real.
@glassresistor This is a true thing.
@glassresistor I am one of those poor, lost souls who didn't think the prequels were universally crap. We do exist, lol.
Is white supremacy inherent to norse paganism or have nazis just hijacked it? I don't know enough about it to know.
How to explore my interest in norse paganism without being surrounded by actual nazis. Hrm.
@catwytch I'm having serious issues with it too. D:
@moonandserpent right? I can't think of a single realistic reason not to beyond capitalism says no.
I really want a few simple woad-blue line and dot designs on my chin and forehead and never have a normal job again I guess.
Unrelated: someone talk me out of getting facial tattoos. Ben failed to make a convincing argument prob bc he thinks it would look badass.
I'll be really glad when that meme dies.
That fucking dress is really bad for ppl who struggle with unreality/dissociation or are recovering from emotional abuse.
@catwytch you are goth Snow White.
That dress fucked me up, man.
@Mowgli3 NO SARAH NOT YOU TOOOOO
tbh, I think some ppl's screens are improperly color calibrated causing the optical illusion. #whiteandgold #blackandblue
@OaklandElle I just don't see it. I am now questioning my entire photography career. D:
@OaklandElle what gold?! T_T
@OaklandElle I am legitimately upset that ppl see this as anything but blue and black. How......?
Storytime with dad before bed. #baby #babysage #child #dadlife #momlife 
@coyote_witch llamas are kind of assholes, I do not blame your horse.
Nothing like seeing a fox or coyote running down your road in front of your house in the middle of the day to make you feel alive.
the fuck is everyone talking about llamas?
@sex_ational I KNOW RIGHT?!
This week's featured photo highlights the constant spectre of death out in sticks. 
Cutest cutie pie. #baby #babysage #child #6monthsold #momlife #mumblr 
@catwytch ...we have to accept our reality, even if embracing it is impossible.
@catwytch There is always a small hope that medical science will catch up with us and there will be good treatments but until then...
@catwytch We are who we are, our kids are who they are, and comparison to other people's lives is the true death.
@catwytch I understand that feeling. I am working to fully accept and face the extent of my physical and mental illnesses. It's ugly.
@catwytch I am there with you. It's akin to grieving. Idk if english has a word for it exactly.
My mom and I would hand dye the reeds and make this gorgeous baskets with no glue or nails and those suckers fucking last, man.
Give me some wood to chop or some baskets to weave. I miss basket weaving. It's so simple and meditative.
Does anyone else with major depression feel the effects less when they are doing constant physical tasks in the elements?
This weird malaise began when I left farming for the first time and I'm still just not into the swing of things out here.
I'm wondering if my lingering discontent stems from not having constant toil, always taking the easy way out bc I can now.
Growing up, we lived off the land bc we had to. It was really hard work but I got so much done every day and read/wrote constantly.
Been spending a lot of time imagining what my daily life would be like w/o the constant distraction of internet, social media, netflix...
@catwytch I am completely obsessed with rare seeds now. I just ordered some rare cotton today. I cannot resist.
@catwytch YASSSSSS BAKER SEED COMPANY YASSSSSSS
Sweet #babysage. #baby #child #6monthsold #momlife #mumblr 
.@bdbreedlove you misspelled guillotine.
@coyote_witch that or like on a toe knuckle are the fucking wooooorst.
So that's how I'm doing.
I just ordered myself a really nice present and I almost started crying bc I don't remember the last time I did anything nice for just me.
Fuck it, I'm shaving my head. This is not a season of my life where I can keep up with one of my signature short, edgy styles.
Got my first #fluffmail today, a woven #wrap, so we can give #babywearing another try. I think… 
#babysage can get anywhere he wants now! #baby #child #6monthsold #momlife #mumblr 
New on the blog! I've been working on this recipe for months and it's nearly perfect: 
A prominent white feminist was a horse's ass last night? YOU DON'T SAY
The cops in weirdoville are WAY creepier than the cannibals. #WalkingDead
@feral_ghost Jesus.
Damn season 5 is going way dark, I love it. #WalkingDead
@feral_ghost TYRESE AND CAROL T_T ::ugly crying::
I deeply enjoy the be-mulletted doctor. #walkingdead
I want to be a zombie extra on this show so badly though.
@feral_ghost He is perfect omg.
@feral_ghost postpartum without any happy baby hormones fucking sucks though, I will tell you that.
@feral_ghost Aw :(
@feral_ghost idk. I never got a good dose of baby hormones so the Judith stuff is only slightly more difficult than usual for me tbh
@feral_ghost Yeah. Though I do keep thinking that Sage would NOT have survived the zombie apocalypse as a colicky baby. &gt;.&lt;
@feral_ghost judith, carol, tyrese I CAN'T HANDLE THIIIIIIIS
why do i watch this shooooooooooow?!
Sitting on the roof with a can of chocolate syrup like the little boy that he is, excuse me while I go die now. T_T
Right in the feels, though. T_T
Really great character development for both.
Finally catching up on Walking Dead after the season 4 halfway break and oh Michonne and Carl. T_T
Loving these new heart print pjs though. #baby #babysage #child #ootd #microfashion #momlife #mumblr 
"Oh, you know, just a casual Sunday morning owl tasting." #baby #babysage #child #6monthsold #momlife… 
And that's my 3am pity party for the night. Sorry, everybody.
Like, who the fuck would I see anyway? What's the fucking point of trying to look good?
I don't even know where to begin to try to go clothes shopping for my horrible new body or if there is even a point in trying.
Nobody tells you about postpartum weight gain from stress, lack of sleep and hormone weirdness. I am fucking hideous.
Ugly truth: I don't leave the house anymore bc I look so bad from the stress and chronic lack of sleep, no clothes that fit.
My kid has completely stopped sleeping again. I look and feel like fucking death bc I haven't been allowed to sleep in 8 months.
I do not recommend having a tiny spawn if you value sleep at all.
@AnarchistPrince I bought some for a friend one time so I own a square foot as well. I'll imagine our square feet are hanging out together.
You can stop now. #snow #winter #snowedin #rural #country #indiana #farmlife #farm #frostycobwebhollow 
@brassiest yes yes yes yep
@brassiest Co-fucking-signed, dude. I don't get it. At all. Maybe bc ppl have been all gatekeeper bullshit about NB and GQ, too.
Here is the first in my new series of wine reviews on the blog! 
I will take -30 windchills over an ice storm any day. D:
Ice storms scare the everloving fuck out of me. It rains icy death down on you. Pulls down trees and power lines easily.
Haven't been complaining about the snow bc we have it relatively easy but it's going to ice all day tomorrow and fuck everything about that.
@brassiest LOOOOOOOOOL
I've decided to start reviewing wine on the blog because why not? Stay tuned for my review of this… 
This view just does not get old. No matter the season, #sunset out this window is breathtaking. (Enjoy… 
@brassiest ah, zee magestic beauty of nature. How sweet, how pristine in it's intelligenz.
@pinkness mine did that last year right before becoming OTC, so maybe that will be the case for you?
Somebunny is in a much better mood today after a horrible day yesterday. I'll take it! #babysage #baby… 
@brassiest I promise.

@coyote_witch I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way.
I don't remember the last time I did anything for myself. I haven't read, written or worked out yet this year. I haven't showered in days.
Losing the battle with the darkness today. Bone tired, overwhelmed, disappointed in myself. Chronic pain eating me alive. Failing at my life
@backtoherroots I'm feeling whiny today. My life is such a mess, body is still so wrecked, I can't imagine when it will possibly get better.
@backtoherroots I loved the pictures! We didn't think ahead so we don't have a good snow outfit for him. :/
@backtoherroots that will be awesome. Sage is extremely bored with the house now so I think things will improve once we can play outside.
@backtoherroots that's encouraging. Sage is already crawling at 6mos old. I am dead meat. &gt;.&lt;
@backtoherroots like nail art? Maybe when he goes to college, lol
@backtoherroots me neither. Sage is so intense all the time. I have no energy for anything beyond barely surviving.
@backtoherroots well that and any semblance of core strength.
@backtoherroots yep, minimum 5hrs a week on nail art and health. That's really the one thing I miss from my old life.
@backtoherroots diy nail art was my thing before farm life and mom life. My hands and nails have never looked worse than now, lol.
@backtoherroots I haven't tried jamberry but it seems like a lot of moms use them.
@backtoherroots probably zoya but none of the less toxic brands have any staying power at all. :/
If you're in a bit of a slump and there is snow around you, I 100% recommend running around in your skivvies in said snow.

Ben thinks I've lost it bc I keep going outside with no pants on but the sun bouncing off the snow makes it quite toasty at leg-level.
It's getting harder to photograph #babysage bc he is always on the move! He is crawling all over the… 
Started a new tradition! Heavy snow means a polar dash around the property in nothing but boots… 
How weird would it be to run around in the snow in my underwear? Having such a shitty day, kind of feel like shaking out the cobwebs (ha)
Official farm name: Frosty Cobweb Hollow or The Frosty Cobweb, if you're feeling sassy.
Noodle is warming his bones on his BFF #maggiemae. #pibble #pitbull #pibblelife… 
@OaklandElle I agree 100%
Like, really? They couldn't even spring for a paltry 20gig card to play with it before you invest in a big, fancy card? Okay.
Very impressed with the @GoPro I got for my birthday but kind of not impressed that such an expensive thing doesn't include a mem card.
@caulkthewagon If you have enough hot water available, take a bath, watch netflix in said bath, light some candles, drink warm beverage
@caulkthewagon Stretch your body, drink a hot toddy and do your nails. Those are my blizzard selfcare suggestions. &lt;3
@coyote_witch All fucked-upness that happens to kids stems directly from them being considered incomplete workers instead of complete humans
@coyote_witch same
@coyote_witch this perceived lack of value under capitalism leads directly to their abuse and exploitation. Ex: spanking and CIO being legal
@coyote_witch they are not considered full people under capitalism bc they don't contribute labor or capital
@coyote_witch the dehumanization of babies and children is a serious cultural problem we have here.
@coyote_witch 
@caulkthewagon You are a wonderful and special human being and I consider myself blessed to know you.
#babysage doesn't get much use of the bouncer anymore but Noodle is hiding from the cold and being all… 
And that is all the complaining I will do on the subject. I promise. :)
ALL I WANT IS TO GARDEN OMG THIS ARCTIC BLAST SHIT IS CRAP!!!!
@catwytch A Val-entine, if you will.
oh @catwytch my bfffffffff, it's a jean-ralphio episode, somehow feels like a Valentine from you to me.
Hoping the kid naps long enough to eat a large amount of food, water, green juice, vitamins, etc. omg
It's 4:30 and all I've eaten today has been 2 cupcakes and excedrin. I feel fucking awful, lol.

@caulkthewagon @bunkosquad It rained for 6 weeks straight in the bay area a few years ago (2010 maybe?) and I lost my everloving mind.
@brassiest Ben thinks I'm kidding about wanting a mule for snowpacalypse transportation but I am completely serious.
@brassiest At least before snow plows everyone would have had access to a horse or a mule. :/
@LibbyBulloff &lt;3
I am embracing my dork nature.
So I'm done with that shit. I don't want my kid to see me toning down my unabashed joy at living for anyone.
I am a huge dork, always have been, finding hilarity and joy in every little thing, but ppl have been extinguishing me since I was a kid.
I'm going through some major changes, dude. I will no longer dampen my joy bc it is fashionable to be jaded and sarcastic.
@brassiest I love this so much!
Pretty sure someone slipped my child a red bull. He isn't unhappy, so it could be worse but he is seriously NEVER awake at this hour wtf.
yep. It's 3am now. Child is still partying. Has basically been partying for 3hrs now. T_T
T_T
Changed him, fed him, swaddled him, rocked him until I physically could not hold him anymore and he's still like WEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
My kid is wiiiiiide awake at 2:30am. Why? He usually sleeps from 9pm-6am minimum. This is terrible.
@AnarchistPrince @bdbreedlove thank you god bless
#valentinesday #highraw banana bowl! 2 bananas, a quarter of a cantaloupe, 2tbs cacao nibs, handful of… 
Arctic blast out of nowhere, dang it. Windchills of 20 below tonight. Super unprepared. This mild winter has made us soft.
@coyote_witch It's truly what he was put on earth to do.
@coyote_witch It seriously is. The women's faces while listening are the best. Also, "clitORis."
I have watched that no less than a dozen times in the past week and I basically pee myself laughing every time.
I thought for sure I would lose FB friends by sharing gilbert gottfried reading 50 shades but somehow I did not. Well done, fb friends.

@icannotpaint &lt;3
Facing my own propensity for violence and shutting it down. The last thing this world needs is another violent white person.
Definitely having a major shift in ideology, tbh. Basically, gardening will save the world.
@caulkthewagon YES. I've always just been so outside the target demographic there, but what straight cis women deal w/ is rough.
@brassiest ugh yes, having hyperemesis gravidarum and then all the new mom support group stuff. Yeah. I misgender myself as default now tbh.
@brassiest duuuuuuuuuuuude. there is no narration. no explanations for anything. it's amazing.
@icannotpaint I go back and forth about "treating" my crazy because at least my crazy is the devil I know, you know?
trigger warning though for death and occasional disturbing/uncanny valley sequences.
Omg, the documentary "Samsara" on netflix. It's blowing my mind right now. @brassiest, watch it, omg.
me: can't. doesn't matter. capitalism always wins.

@OaklandElle this is such a great shot of you!

JUST HAD MY FIRST OFFICIAL EGG CUSTOMER
We are trying to decide our official farm name, not entirely sold on sticking with Fluffy Butt Acres. Plz give me your ideas!
I just did super grownup business lady stuff and I am proud of myself!
@coyote_witch The pot doesn't work well for me, but I use the spray bottle every day.
@coyote_witch use the neti spray bottle instead of the pot
@caulkthewagon I remember ppl making fun of us while we were cowering inside away from -50F windchills and racking up $500 heating bills.
@caulkthewagon That's horrible. I can't believe people are that callous.
@caulkthewagon Being iced in for months last year w/ the arctic blasts is still a fresh memory for me. I'm so sorry for your weather woes.
Def one of those days where I'm counting down until Sage's bedtime. T_T

First #guineafowl #eggs of the year, a month earlier than expected!!! They are bigger this year… 
@brassiest @AnarchistPrince oh god that episode though T_T
@brassiest The thought has crossed my mind but Ben is like nah to the baby modelling. lol
@caulkthewagon Everything I've heard about it is just a giant nope for me. I think I'm going to pass on this one.
@brassiest He got all the best possible looking genes from the two of us, I swear.
@brassiest I DON'T KNOW. The genes were like, well he's going to be high needs, colicky, intense, etc so we better make him extra cute.
#babysage enjoying some new pajams. #baby #infant #child #childhood #mumblr #momlife 
@torrangray A chiro basically fixed Sage, so.
O_O
That video about the Mars mission finalists fucked me up.
"and my cat had major surgery and refuses all means of taking her antibiotics, sorry, sorry, sorry."
"hello, sorry, I was working through massive childhood trauma all week and I have a 6 month old, oops."
I was a little late ordering a print for a customer and I considering sending them an email explaining but like what would say?
@brassiest preschool childcare is so expensive, all of the second income goes to it, so moms have cut out the middle man to raise their kids
@brassiest it's an old article too, so it completely neglects how the childcare bubble has burst and forced moms out of the workforce.
@brassiest I now feel kind of awkward that there are women who disrespect the work of motherhood so much though. :/
@brassiest oh wow, she is a nasty piece of work. She would fucking hate me, ha.
Watching Parks and Rec and here's Jean Ralphio and he always makes me miss @catwytch T_T
I'm just waiting for Sage to go down for bed and then I am going to murd this decadent vegetarian meal, omg.
"unpizza" which is stir fried onions, garlic and zukes smothered in moz, and tagine dogs, which is like chili dogs but w/ tagine.
Very surprised to find good looking zucchini in the store today so I straight up cooked my favorite meal tonight....
@coyote_witch completely gorgeous! Feeling it.

I smell like the ocean. That is pretty neat.
I think the ocean smell might be me? I stopped wearing antiperspirant and I'm just using EOs now and I smell great?
@torrangray The best therapist I ever had isn't even board certified.
@Faustrate shoot my ashes out of a cannon out at sea, goodbye
@Faustrate now the presidential anthem or whatever is playing in my head to thoughts of a pinup shoot with taft. I am dead, goodbye.
@Faustrate goodbye cruel world, I am gone
@Faustrate imagining the type of personality a modern 26 year old who is a total stan for president taft would be like omg
@Faustrate Yep, I am still losing my shit laughing about this thought 10 minutes later.
@Faustrate 30+ "taftoos" I'm just imagining him being absolutely covered with pics of president taft in various pinup poses.
I am just full of questions today.
Why does twitter keep promoting nasty looking meat ads into my timeline?! Bleck.
@moonandserpent but it does seriously feel like someone is like vibing these ocean smells to me! or a ghost's memory or something.
@moonandserpent It is mucky and gray over here today. Way too much rain recently.
WHY DO I KEEP SMELLING THE OCEAN?!
I keep smelling the ocean. I live in Indiana. Why do I keep smelling the ocean?
@caulkthewagon I like that it actually supports instead of just squishing them and I don't need to double up.
@caulkthewagon It's absolutely worth the cost bc it actually supports and evenly distributes the weight instead of killing your shoulders.
@caulkthewagon Might I recommend the "shock absorber" sports bra? It's the only one I've found that does the job for my DD-Es.
I didn't get much of a childhood, so for Sage I will do all I can to keep the magic on this brutal world for as long as I can.
My number 1 goal for Sage is to keep him safe physically and mentally but number 2 is to make his life a magical fairy land.
@brassiest yes exactly! Sensitivity is not the problem ya jerks.
@OaklandElle the green accents and the jacket cut are killing me.
@OaklandElle as is, it's just tacky.
@OaklandElle If the shirt was a neutral and the cut wasn't horrible, it would be an interesting statement piece.
@OaklandElle Oh yeah, I'm actually feeling that, especially with the understated makeup and hair. Very nice.
@OaklandElle I enjoy the surrealism factor but that jacket sleeve length is bad. The cut it bad.
@OaklandElle i wouldn't hate it if it actually fit him properly and had a different shirt underneath, tbh.
@OaklandElle the cut of suit that is trendy right now is truly awful. All the men look like they raided a child's closet for pants. Bad.
@OaklandElle not feeling it, personally.
@OaklandElle I honestly have felt that way about everything everyone has worn at every awards show recently. Fashion is bad right now.
Time for some seasonal #cupcakes! #vday #valentinesday #pink #foodanddrink #glutenfree 
@pinkness ooooooh. ooooooooh yes, this.
@coyote_witch Welp, that sounds familiar to my dyscalculic self.
Ugggggh this whole week is going to be so fucked up now.
Oh wow flat tire reeeeeeally just seriously fucked up the next 3 days at least.
For those who are new to my story here, hello, I was raised in a cult.
A big thing is that I have decided to pursue both Al-Anon and memory retrieval/therapy work w/ a therapist who specializes in deprogramming.
I'm doing the hard work I need to do to pull out the memoir I need to write and it's painful, beautiful and healing.
This mercury retrograde has been an amazing period of growth and healing for me, tbh.
#babysage today. #baby #infant #child #childhood #mumblr #momlife #teething

Omg, my child just had the loudest, most bubbly sounding poop ever and laughed the whole time while bouncing in his swing. looooool
Oh high needs child. Oh my, oh my, oh my.
@soycamo It looks amazing!
@soycamo oh my god.
I've yelled "goddamn white male carpetbagging pieces of shit" at least 30x already today. Send help for Ben.
@NikiSparkles you are a very good mom and she is going to always remember how hard you've tried for her.
With the high needs baby, we can't even go on dates so having surprise new foods come to our door for cheaper than a date is appealing.
That's one thing I miss about the bay area and being childless/farmless: the ability to just pick up and try new things, travel.
At risk of being way bougie, we just gifted ourselves a @trytheworld subscription bc it's impossible to try new things where we live now.
@torrangray I AM NOT ANGRY WITH YOU!!!!! If you needed reassurance on that point. I am just busy and stressed right now. ::hugs::
Little #blackcat is happy to be home and doing amazingly well after having surgery just yesterday. I… 
@glassresistor it's a very hard headspace to be in.
@glassresistor I understand completely. Mine was much worse before I made serious changes to deal with my anxiety and PTSD.
@coyote_witch @glassresistor no better medicine. Yours is still the best I've ever had!
@glassresistor my dear friend @catwytch might have more suggestions as their ibs is more severe than mine.
@glassresistor once you feel like you're recovering from this bout, definitely use fermented foods to help heal the gut
@glassresistor I personally haven't tried kava but have heard it has helped others with stress ibs.
@glassresistor is your ibs also food triggered? Bc fat is generally really hard on ibs bowels, too.
@glassresistor yeah it's all long term lifestyle changes unfortunately. I feel your pain, literally.
@glassresistor pot, rescue remedy, yoga/meditation/any exercise that chills you out rather than stimulates, avoid caffeine+chocolate+HFCS
"smarmy piece of wiener cheese" is the best insult I've ever heard. It has replaced mayonnaise. Sorry, tumblr.
#babysage just hanging around. #baby #child #teething #childhood #mumblr #momlife #motherhood… 
@brassiest at the very least, they would likely be able to direct to people who could help if they can't/won't.
@feral_ghost I can't even tolerate having antivaxxers as friends anymore. This shit is outrageous.
We can't travel bc of this. We can't take him to playgroups bc the nearest town is a major college town and pocket of antivax.
Sage is getting all vax on schedule but he can't get MMR until August. Meanwhile, Chicago has measles, which means Indy will have it soon.
@coyote_witch yes. done. patent this.
Poor Ben dealing with my daily rant about anti-vaxxers. "MEASLES??!! FUCKING MEASLES???!"
@brassiest would habitat for humanity help?
It's like Christmas morning over here! Just received the first batch of seeds for the season and my… 
@Faustrate that is most excellent.
All this cataclysmic shit I've been through in the past year and no ritual recognition.
I feel like maybe my 30th birthday needed more recognition.
@tasneemraja I'm so sorry Tasneem. This is beyond terrible.
Yes, hello, I am now the stereotype of the SAHM who has become a bitter, identity-less, withered husk of a person.
If I had any idea that shit would become this hard and painful, there are about 15 different forks in the road I would have taken.
I use "just" too often. This is why I will never be a good enough writer. I am too lazy.
This is the type of week where I just want to drink myself into a coma but won't because it's too much effort.
Like, I get it. Thank you, universe. I recognize that I must have done something pretty fucked up in a past life for this to be my karma.
Today, today I am just angry, sad, disappointed and tired. I am just tired of paying for my shitty life choices.
These two are glued to each other because the little black cat is in surgery today. :( #pibble… 
I didn't know I had a saint so germane to my interests, tbh.
St. Gertrude of Nivelles is a patron saint of cats, gardeners, travelers and mental illness.
There's a special circle of hell for those people.
Looking for prayers to St. Getrude for my cat's surgery tomorrow and found one for lab test cats and just T_T
@OaklandElle @superbranch @brassiest D:
@superbranch @brassiest oh geeze, I stand corrected. Fuck.
@brassiest no, just outside of Oakland in emeryville
@brassiest um dance moms is now on netflix. It's too much drama for even me lol
Sensory play! #baby #babysage #infant #child #childhood #mumblr #momlife #unschool 
I would like to know how this #child is still awake. Only slept 2hrs in the last 12 and refuses to… 
@brassiest @AlterNet @MarthRosenberg OMG FUCK THEM FUCK THEM FUCK THEM. They wouldn't last a day inside my brain or body.
@brassiest I am so proud of you. Your strength, tenacity and positivity are humbling. You need to give yourself credit for your strength.
Guess whose child decided not to sleep! Today is going to blow. Today already blows, damn.
@coyote_witch Thank you. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@caulkthewagon You are so sweet. Thank you so much for your support. I know you're dealing with big things right now.
@caulkthewagon We got her an ultrasound bc she was still peeing blood despite several rounds of antibiotics and steroids. Now we know why.
@caulkthewagon It's such an unusual thing that every vet has just given us antibiotics since the symptoms are identical to UTIs.
@caulkthewagon She's always had "behavioral problems" so she has been collecting kidney stones basically since birth. T_T
@caulkthewagon She has a huge amount of kidney stones adhered to the walls of her bladder and a deformation. I can't even imagine her pain.
I should be asleep but I'm just sitting up worrying about my baby kitty.
I'm thankful we are able to get her the help she needs because if we couldn't she'd need to get put down. It's that bad.
And this surgery she's getting is so scary. T_T
I'm so sad for my baby kitty. She has been in such bad shape for so long and we didn't know. She has been suffering horribly.
@OaklandElle lipstick twins!
@caulkthewagon the pressure/judgment/fear of government interference is truly unbelievable.
Very sick kitty needs a $1000 surgery this week. T_T
@alephnought that is great to hear!
I mean it's not a barrel of laughs over here or anything, with teething, gloomy weather, chronically ill cat, etc, but we are managing.
I am thinking of you, praying for you. I am the Polo to your Marco.
Quite worried about most of you who I'm following on here and fb, frankly. Mercury retrograde/winter is being really unkind to ya'll.
No making this guy happy today. #babysage #baby #teething #infant #child #momlife #motherhood…

@brassiest yuck yuck yuck. That is an unbelievable violation. D:
@brassiest omg that is horrifying. I'm so sorry. D:
@catwytch my child! &lt;3
@catwytch @OaklandElle BEETS! PICKLED BEETS!
@catwytch YASSSSSS!
I want pizza and sunshine. Though if it was sunny, I probably wouldn't want the pizza. carbs=sunshine
this weather is such a fucking bummer though. I am so dead tired. Bad, lazy, useless mom over here.
Yesterday I ordered the most seeds I ever have at once and I'm sooooooo excited for planting season omg.
@pinkness I have dyscalculia and I still have trouble with left and right. It's partially why I'm so terrified to drive.
My sweet #babysage. #baby #infant #child #childhood #teething #mumblr #momlife #motherhood… 
@AnarchistPrince Sage has discovered his tongue so he's always bouncing with his tongue out giggling. It's too much!
@AnarchistPrince I didn't expect him to be soooooo funny so early! Kids are hilarious.
I do believe his childhood is going to be fun, adventurous, magical. He has such a light in him, I don't want to do anything to dim it.
My kid is so funny, just an unbelievable crackup. He's still really challenging 24-7 but there's a lot more laughter now.
It's hard to catch #babysage bc he's always in motion. #baby #infant #child #childhood #mumblr… 
Delilah helping me plan our epic herb #garden, including catnip. #gardening #herbs #farmlife #blackcat… 
@brassiest Yes, we get those here, too. Def a woodpecker!
@brassiest If you have a smartphone, there are some awesome bird ID apps available.
@brassiest It's probably a type of woodpecker. There are tons of varieties and they don't all have red heads.
@brassiest I spent an hr srsly pruning the bush that is the bane of my existence and now I can see the birds from the couch again. Love it!
@brassiest We got suet in bulk on amazon for super cheap. The same stuff as we get at the store for half the price.
@AnarchistPrince @coyote_witch STAHP. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince @brassiest my hair is way longer than in my photo. It grew hella fast after Sage was born and I could eat again.
@brassiest i'll dm you my url. Only like 3 ppl in real know it.
@brassiest I am small time tumblr famous, it's weird.
@brassiest If you make a post, I'll spam my considerable amount of followers with it.
@Faustrate @AnarchistPrince @brassiest BAD INFLUENCES FOR ME WHO IS TRYING TO GROW OUT MY HAIR
@AnarchistPrince @brassiest errybody been watching just enough peaky blinders.
@brassiest Have you gone to tumblr with this? I have seen tumblr be much better for medical fundraising than twitter. Esp for queers.
@OakScott @coyote_witch Thank you for getting it. I am terrified to take my little guy anywhere bc he is too small for flu or Tdap vax. :(
@coyote_witch It was one thing when I lived in cities and could just go get them fixed and easily shop around but I live so far from town.
@coyote_witch I've definitely had more bad haircuts than good in my life by a wide margin.
I just put gin in this ginger beer. Very good decision, A+ me.
@coyote_witch that's partially why I'm trying to grow it out, so I can find hair ppl who know what to do with it.
@coyote_witch I'm still searching for someone here who can do edgy short hair and deal with my 15 cowlicks.
@coyote_witch @Faustrate I was watching an episode of SVU yesterday and they mentioned a drink called "5Crazy" and I also thought of Liz.
@coyote_witch It's framing your face beautifully!
@coyote_witch Lovely!
#teething. #latergram #baby #babysage #infant #child #mumblr #momlife #momsofinstagram #motherhood 
#babysage usually naps a total of 4hrs a day. Today he hasn't napped at all so he came out to help me… 
@catwytch Sage's whole life has been dark times. T_T
My child will not nap today. He is usually on nap 2 by now. FML
@catwytch Sage is teething and going through a leap and we are losing our minds. He normally naps pretty well but hasn't slept today. D:
@catwytch Like I literally just look around the room and sing about what i see, lol.
@catwytch Yeah, sometimes me making up this rambling nonsense song about dreams is the only thing that will Sage to be calm.
High needs babies shouldn't be allowed to teethe. Related, mama needs a whole bottle of wine right now omg.
Rough teething day, resisting nap, so he's telling his troubles to his pirate quilt. #babysage #baby… 
@backtoherroots it's completely normal!
@pinkness saaaaaaaaaame omg. Though no one anywhere would call me a MILF, I find bitch really triggering.
Happy bab. #babysage #baby #infant #child #childhood #mumblr #momlife #motherhood #momsofinstagram… 
@catwytch ok thanks. &lt;3
@catwytch i'm bracing myself, lol.
@catwytch No, I just answered it.
@catwytch it's too much coincidence that i'm getting vegan asks today. Anyone who has followed me for more than a week knows about the farm.
@catwytch oh no, I think I got an ask from your troll. &gt;.&lt;
#babysage loves his sensory rattles! #baby #child #infant #mumblr #momlife #motherhood… 
@Mike_hugs yep
@glassresistor @OaklandElle @coyote_witch It's basically unreadable.
@OaklandElle @coyote_witch @glassresistor You and Martha saved the functionality of my hands I'm sure of it.
@OaklandElle @coyote_witch @glassresistor Officer Lawless and the nerve damage in my hands TYVM
@coyote_witch @OaklandElle I also heard it was 3.5K per person. Where is he getting his number from?
@coyote_witch @OaklandElle BLEGGGHHHH. But yeah, if he doesn't take his, more for us.
@catwytch looooooooooooooool it's all made of gluten free organic free range cotton yarn
@catwytch Yeah, that happens to all my vulture culture friends on there. Idk why it doesn't happen to me, prob bc I post vegan propaganda.
@catwytch weeeeeeeeeird.
@torrangray With my ADHD and dyscalculia, I have SO been there. My whole life. It's horrible, I'm so sorry. :(
I eat so many fucking bananas. Like 2 a day. D:
I keep having an allergic reaction to something and it makes my lips itch and burn horribly. I suspect it is bananas but I am in denial.
@outmouth woooooooooow wow
Morning face. #babysage #baby #infant #child #mumblr #momlife #motherhood #momsofinstagram

@caulkthewagon here is also a thing: 
Happy birthday to me! I am not in jail, planning a funeral or dealing w/ an arctic blast or the pregnancy from hell, so I'm a happy camper.
Happy #adoption day #maggiemae! Bringing her home is one of the best decisions we have ever made and I… 
@Mike_hugs r u ok
Bless you my child for taking 2 big naps today so I can do these things.
This thing I need to write is seriously going to piss a few people off like whoa.
Heavy research day for the memoir. Also learning about the legal issues of memoir-writing so I don't get sued. Brain fried.
I think my soul wounds from Occupy are actually healing because I am now organizing a local anarchist/gentle parenting collective. o_O
@pinkness oh hell no
Finally starting research for my book in earnest and hoooo buddy, my childhood was fucked. up.

@Faustrate :( :( :(
@catwytch uggggh that shit is nerve wracking. I'm sorry. Use your rescue remedy and diffuse citrus, sandalwood or lavender.
Working on a new recipe! It turned out amazing. #butternutsquash #chowder #soup #vegetarian #gourmet… 
No bones about, this is a cute kid. Follow sage's dad @bdbreedlove! #babysage #microfashion #ootd… 
@catwytch I am definitely planning on looking into it after I get my drivers license this year.
@catwytch I think I will probably sell doterra eventually.
@catwytch It's surprisingly one of the cheaper blends and we love it. I use elevation in a roller tube on myself but it overstimulates Sage.
@catwytch I recommend citrus bliss from doterra. It really helps Sage's mood and it is a truly uplifting scent.
I can't fathom the selfishness of people who put every baby too tiny to vaccinate at risk of death bc it's their personal right to be stupid
It's goddamn privileged-ass morons choosing not to vaccinate and putting everyone else's BABIES at risk. Little bitty babies.
Antiscience garbage can assholes. How many babies are going to have to die of preventable diseases before this shit stops?!
Every day I get less able to handle antivaxxers. THANKS FOR BRINGING MEASLES BACK TO THE US WELL DONE EVERYONE FUCK YOU

#babysage wants you to go follow his dad @bdbreedlove #baby #infant #child #farmlife #dadlife #mumblr 
BEN IS ON INSTAGRAM. Everyone go follow him @ beardsbarnsbabies
My brain has been trying to escape out of my eyes all day. T_T Idk what to do about these headaches.
@brassiest @feral_ghost @JimBeam yeeeeeesh my alcoholic dad would pull this shit all the time. His drinking killed him.
I need a better front facing camera. #selfie #momlife #moriwitch #lush #notbadfor30 
It's almost like being in a sensory deprivation chamber.
But at night it is pitch black and silent so I took the night off from kidlet duty, slept down there for the first time and it was magical.
There's this little room off the basement I call the dungeon and we don't do anything with it bc it's kind of creepy
@ElleArmageddon I'm sorry. Thinking of you. &lt;3
@brassiest I have sooooooo been here. Black hair is not exciting, but very healthy looking and easy.
@brassiest I like the blue. &lt;3
That fox is totally fucking with me. Is it real or a very cute hallucination?
@caulkthewagon hey, I'm thinking of you.
I'm sure it's completely fine that I'm so tired half my face keeps seizing and drooping. That's cool.
@OaklandElle I'm sorry this shit happened to you. :(
@glassresistor ugggggh I want a vitamix
This kid has completely broken me. My empathy button doesn't work anymore. I am just tired and empty.
Don't let the smile fool you, he is putting me through my paces this week. Growth spurt (leap) and… 
@OaklandElle I mean, I haven't even seen last season.
@OaklandElle okay. :) I definitely plan on getting an HBOgo account when they start selling them w/o cable subscription.
@OaklandElle Sage is completely unpredictable so I can't schedule anything. :/ I have no fucking life.
@pinkness I admire you so much.
@OaklandElle He made a demon deal, I'm sure of it.
@OaklandElle yup. yes. and the hair.
@Faustrate @Mike_hugs yes yes yes yep
@Faustrate That happens on/in my feet about 4 times a year and it's horrendous.
@brassiest @OaklandElle I know it could help if I was actually able to get any rest. I don't have it in me to do more than necessary.
@OaklandElle @brassiest I have been there before but I'm not anymore bc i can't really do much of what I used to and I look awful/feel worse
@brassiest oh hai, do we have the same mom?
@brassiest my mom is small. Like 5'2" 110lbs small. I am basically twice her size and I know she judges me.
@brassiest she has always been do nasty about their weights and I'm like hello I'm standing right here.
@brassiest yes. Her family is all extremely small, none of the women eat. My dad's side all have weight issues and I got his genes.
@brassiest and now that I am seriously overweight postpartum, I know she is disgusted with me even though she hides it.
@brassiest I know my mom has eaten less than 1500cals a day her entire life, usually much less than that.
@brassiest my mom has always been outrageously fatphobic and I know it's where all my food and body shit cane from.
@brassiest I seriously think it's something sick in that particular generation.
Just really fucking bad. Pray for me.
Today is a very very bad day.
@torrangray Though John Boy is fucking me up. He looks, sounds and acts like my ex.
@torrangray But everything else is REALLY GOOD. Really really good. All other casting, cinematography, styling are all A+.
@torrangray I feel like they were conflating Irish Travelers and Rroma.
@torrangray In that era, Rroma wouldn't refer to themselves as gypsies and they were cast way too white.
@torrangray I had a major issue with the casting of the barmaid/spy and basically everything having to do with the Lee family.
@torrangray Besides the romance storyline in the first season and some historical inaccuracies, I REALLY like it.
@torrangray We got halfway through the second season over the long weekend but I don't know when we will have time to watch it again.
@torrangray Not yet, but I kind of hope he (I'm guesing male bc it was so big) moves on bc foxes are bad news for our chickens+guineas.
I JUST SAW A FOX FOR THE FIRST TIME OMG. It was running around in the back yard. They're bigger than I thought. Such fluffy tails!
@pinkness oh wow that is such a shitty thing to ask.
@Faustrate same
@pinkness I love you and think you're awesome! You're a great mom and a good person.
@backtoherroots thank you for posting this! It will help me plan mine. :)
@catwytch SCREAMING!
Woke up with a bad diaper rash so we are having an all day naked baby party! #babysage #baby #infant… 
@pinkness oh my!
@brassiest I am so sorry. That is fucking awful. &lt;3
I don't know how he does it but he can really move now! He started at the white blanket but here he… 
@brassiest try not to be embarrassed. The US health system is sooooo fucked, everyone has to do fundraisers. It's not your fault.
OMG my kid is a nightmare today and I'm having constant headaches again. Probably need new glasses or idk 5hrs of uninterrupted sleep ever.
#babysage in motion. #baby #child #cute #childhood #infant #mumblr #momlife #momsofinstagram #country… 
A snapshot of our silly life. If you listen you can hear the #guineafowl yelling at nothing. #baby… 
@catwytch @torrangray indeed. &lt;3
@torrangray "I'm having surgery in 2 days, fuck off." Would be my knee jerk response.
@torrangray wtf wtf wtf this is so rude. Unless it's to say "yum that looks good!" Ppl shouldn't comment on food.
@brassiest I really hate the side effects. I only take it if I literally cannot get out of bed bc of my back.
@brassiest I was on flexiril for a while for a torn back muscle and I was constantly bloated and fatigued. I put on at least 20lbs of water.
@glassresistor Maggie wraps herself up on blankies too! It's a pibble thing.
@brassiest me too. &lt;3
@torrangray have you spoken to HR about this shit?
Johnny Boy looks like my ex and it's flipping me out. #PeakyBlinders
Cillian Murphy with the horses omg. T_T #PeakyBlinders
This show might single-handedly ruin my hair growing-out goals. #PeakyBlinders
Poor Danny. T_T #PeakyBlinders
@AnarchistPrince @brassiest seeeeeriously. I'm getting mine done like this for real.
The cinematography and styling are just wonderful. #PeakyBlinders
(Yeah, if ya'll can clog my feed with football, I can clog yours with Peaky Blinders.)
ooooooh, that's Narcissa Malfoy. That's who she is. #PeakyBlinders
This makes me want pronounce "comrades" differently and wear red and smoke. Oops.
Cillian Murphy reminds me of this maths professor I had who was so gorgeous I had to switch classes bc I was too distracted by his face.
Oooooooh the dimples, oooooooooh the dimples. #PeakyBlinders
This is unbelievably gorgeously shot and I love the soundtrack. Brilliant. #peakyblinders
I am so here for Cillian Murphy. He could be reading the dictionary under flat white lighting and I would give it 5 stars.

Straight up, I deserve a pony for tackling my driving phobia.
It is official that I am finally going to fade my biggest fear and get my drivers license this year but afterwards I will demand a horse.
@brassiest I'm starting it after my MIL leaves in a few days and then we can talk.
@soycamo idk what a tiny letter is, but I would def read your food blog!

I'm going to snuggle my kidlet, eat pizza, drink wine, read and go to bed at like 9 tonight. Fuck the internet and America.
I am so completely drained today and now another little piece of my soul has died under white supremacist heteropatriarchy.
This country is sick to the fucking core. It's unsavable. Burn it down and salt the earth so nothing can spring up from it's diseased corpse
I know white ppl apologizing to black ppl is unwanted and obnoxious but what I just learned is so fucking awful and I am so sorry.
I'm not going to repeat it but it is so horrible that I feel so sick and almost regret bringing a child into this fucked up world.
Sometimes I learn something so goddamn heinous that I wish the internet did not exist.
@NikiSparkles D: wtf wtf wtf
This is the first time I've been alone in at least 6 months, omg.
Sage is passed out in his bassinet. All the animals are asleep. Ben is in Indy picking up his mom from the airport.
Kidlet was on my very last nerve so bedtime was pushed up an hour and I know I'm going to pay for it at 4am but I do not care.
#babysage is on the move! Not quite crawling, but can definitely get where he wants to go by worming… 
@torrangray this is sooooo fucked up. I'm sorry this is happening. I wish there was something I could do.
@Mike_hugs they actually cool your brain so nope, do not remove.
@catwytch you did the absolute best you could, I know it!
@catwytch I am so sorry. I had a betta named Winston for almost 4 years. He was amazing. Fish are amazing.

@brassiest you have convinced me
omg i fucking slayed in the kitchen tonight.
@Faustrate Not even yarn. It's just wool balls.
5 months old today! Chilling in a pile of pillows after naptime earlier. #babysage #baby #infant… 
@Faustrate They will save you many quarters bc they cut drying time down significantly.
It has been so long since I played a video game bc they triggered my nausea while preg and the zofran made it impossible to focus anyway.
Ridiculous amount of things to do but all I want to do is play video games.
I finally listened to Lana Del Rey for the first time and I super do not get it. She sounds like cheese whiz.
@Mike_hugs @brassiest @Occupocalypse @KelestiMMO WHO IS THIS PERSON?!
@KelestiMMO @thevitaes @brassiest @Mike_hugs who the fuck is shaun king?
@brassiest That's so weird. D:
@catwytch Goth bombshell incoming!
@brassiest how do you even find out who blocked you? (now I'm curious if I have random blocks)
@catwytch I got both "confident" and "decisive"...because I couldn't decide, lol.
@catwytch honestly, I've never tried any scrub of any kind that remotely approaches the sea salt scrub.
@catwytch I went all out
@catwytch two lip colors, sea salt scrub, bombs and melts.
@bdbreedlove EFF YOU OLD MAN
It was literally less than the size of my little fingernail.
Baby Sage just had his very first nibble of food. Steamed broccoli! He thought it was awesome!
@brassiest Everyone on that show who isn't a cis-man can get it as it is.
@brassiest i kno rite
@coyote_witch cruel.
Ordered my birthday present today in the form of an excessive amount of Lush products. It's good to be me.
@bdbreedlove eff you, old man.
Trying to will my hair to grow longer with positive long hair vibes. That works, right?
@coyote_witch The bats used to rise from every building and barn every summer evening like clouds of flies. They are gone now.
@coyote_witch And there were never black flies here before a few years ago and now they are a serious threat to livestock in the spring.
@coyote_witch The winters are a serious thing here now. Even just the chickens and barn cats require major winter infrastructure.
@coyote_witch I kind of feel like I made a slight error in judgment deciding to farm here bc I was basing it on the weather I knew as a kid.
@coyote_witch These polar blasts never happened when I was a kid and now they're a matter of course.
@coyote_witch It would rarely get below 10 degrees but we would get dozens of feet of snow every winter.
@coyote_witch but there are these constant bitter winds. It's more like steppe than the (relatively) warm, wet winters of my youth.
@coyote_witch This year is particularly bizarre. The grass is growing in January. Many migratory birds never left. We've had no snow.
@MercianRockyRex @coyote_witch yikes
@coyote_witch The winters here are completely different now from what I knew growing up, too.
@coyote_witch the 2nd winter I lived in CA, it rained for ~6 wks straight and that was basically the last time normal winter happened there.
@coyote_witch I would be there for a week and see the sun maybe twice. Many memories of cold, rainy beaches.
@coyote_witch I would visit family/friends in CA almost every January in HS and college and it was always very wet and lush green.

@caulkthewagon I will! We have one in the mall here.
@caulkthewagon I've never had any luck there but it's been a while since I tried. Their stuff was always too long.
I have to literally try on every fucking thing in the store in 3 different sizes to do so, but I do always find a few things there.
I have a very hard to fit body but somehow I can always find cute clothes for cheap at H and M.
OMG OMG OMG OMG new clothes. T_T
I just remembered that an H and M opened in our local mall while I was pregnant so I might actually be able to afford some new clothes soon.
For those keeping score at home, I DID PILATES TODAY MOTHER-EFFERS. Not a lot of pilates but plenty.
@torrangray errrrr u is supposed to be I. Thanks autocorrect!

@chaos46692 It's alive and it needs to stop.
@chaos46692 It is not okay.
I've wasted no less than $100 trying to make myself like kombucha. I resolve to let this one go and not do that anymore.
@coyote_witch She's an ultra-leveled advanced hippie wizard.
@coyote_witch I've tried so many different flavors and even with chia seeds, which I love. It's all like alcohol vomit. T_T
Every time I've tried kombucha I've felt like someone was playing a cruel joke on me. A single tear falls. "Fellow hippies, why?!"
Kombucha: alcohol that's gone horribly awry without even giving a nice buzz.
Unpopular opinion: kombucha is undrinkably nasty. It straight up tastes like vomit.
@shareefali Hopefully if they are form-fitting they won't ride up so bad. When he is SQUIRMING AROUND BEING A DANG BABY.
@shareefali Sage's legs are super long and thin so they're prob just going to fit like normal pants, tbh.
He is also getting one pair of plain gray sweats bc you can't go wrong with those.
So guess who is getting 7 new pairs of "girl" leggings. My kid, that's who.
Clicked girl next and it was a sea of leggings. No less than 20 designs. And for cheaper. WTFFFFFF
I naturally clicked boy first and it was meager pickings of jeans (jeans for babies? no.) and ugly-ass sportball sweats.
Explanation: I was looking at an online clearance sale of baby clothes and you have to choose boy/girl to search.
Baby pants have to stretch over diapers. Why would you gender stretchy baby pants?!
I am soooooo pissed off that baby leggings are gendered as baby girl clothes instead of gender neutral. THEY ARE LEGGINGS.
@NikiSparkles My hair is sooooo bad right now that making it my first goal should guarantee I lose 10lbs asap, lol.
(tw weight loss talk) Motivating myself with the following rewards: haircut after 10lbs, septum piercing after 20lbs, tattoo after 30lbs.
Seeing some of the looks from last night and I am srsly displeased with fashion right now. I'm going full mori witch until fashion recovers.
@catwytch &lt;3
I miss having an ass. And abs. And not having crippling back pain from postpartum core weakness.
Today is the day I start working out again. Pray for me. &gt;.&lt;
@brassiest Go outside and take rapid breaths of cold air! Knocks out the cobwebs.
@torrangray I wish I could actually do something cool with it like cause power surges when I'm angry or take down power grids.
@torrangray There are a huge amount of red flags happening there. Don't feel bad about it.
@torrangray This explains why technology constantly shits the bed around me lol
All my electronics are fucking with me recently. Why.
MY LAPTOP SUDDENLY REFUSES TO CHARGE WHYYYYY???????
@brassiest percentages are a bit muddy because of the holocaust, but I am to some degree on my mom's side.
@brassiest most of the world does not consider us white, no.
@catwytch word.
@catwytch Maybe only send her the angelic ones. :/
@catwytch wtf. &gt;:[ (Send them to me instead.)
"Oh darn it, I didn't realize I had to mop my floors made of gold, what a massive inconvenience." Shut up. Just shut up.
Anyway, complaining about the challenges that come with any bounty is fucking gross and tone deaf and omg what is wrong with you.
People who find the cloud in every silver lining are fucking exhausting. I know I'm not an overly cheerful person but damn.
There truly is no pleasing some ppl. You could give them a million dollars and all they'd do is complain about paying taxes on it.

@Faustrate i think i had that same bow.
@caulkthewagon i love this kid so much.
@Mike_hugs Basically anything that eats mosquitoes and buffalo gnats are my faves. I'm easy to please.
@Mike_hugs nooooooooooo! Bats are my favorite animal. I love them so so so much like bordering on obsession love. T_T
And he works so hard at everything. Everything is high intensity. He is 100% Leo.
I'm so fucking in love with my kid, it's ridiculous. He is so smart and funny. He cracks me up constantly.
@catwytch oh yeah, they're worth the money, for sure.
@torrangray yup. That's why we have to take care of each other. &lt;3
@catwytch And seriously, they last forever. You'll need another pair in 20 years.
@catwytch Do it. You have to walk the dog too. ;)
@torrangray @catwytch yeah, unpleasant surprise.
Oh cool, when you unblock someone on here it autofollows them for you. Fucking rad. &gt;:[

@coyote_witch is it really your birthday or did you give fb a fake bday?
@torrangray I would like to be that person but I am afraid to commit bc life with baby is so unpredictable. I don't want to let you down.
@caulkthewagon Yeah, friends is real bad.
@Faustrate the gummy calciums I've been taking are one of the best parts of my day, for real. A+ would recommend, my gummy loving friend.
.@HealthyNotFishy by spamming me with an ad you have guaranteed I will never try your product.
Omg I don't even know with my mentions right now.
@Faustrate but it's like a low hose of adderall without the teeth grinding or rage.
@Faustrate it's worth noting that I have basically been a tea totaler for 18 months bc of pregnancy and breastfeeding.
@coyote_witch lolling at the typo I just noticed here. Ear cabal, loooool
I have ppl here cleaning my house. It's weird.
I read that magnesium and fish oil can treat ADHD so I decided to try it and yes it feels like I've taken adderall. I can see thru time.
@icannotpaint that is horrifying. :(
@icannotpaint nah, those weed costs make me sad bc I am not there.
@coyote_witch I had a horrible ear cabal zit recently too wtf bodies
Somehow this person is in my farming, occupy and parent circles yet they are not personally involved in any if those things?! How?! Go away.
They're seriously involved in everything on the internet. I cannot escape them.
This world is way too small sometimes. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get away from a particular narcissist from my past.
@icannotpaint that is absolutely awful. :(
@coyote_witch watch out for the constipation too, fyi

@brassiest I can't find the video now though. :(
@brassiest ...and a dude whacked them with a sword until they ran off.
@brassiest The best thing that ever happened was they infringed on a tai chi class in chinatown w/ their videocamera....
@brassiest oh god oh god oh god that is a laughably awful person.
Chiropractor, epic breakfast, chocolate fruit smoothie, sunny skies. Not a bad start to a Monday.
@brassiest I have hours like that a few times a week. It's been so long ago but still feels like it was just yesterday sometimes.
Just got my first chiropractic adjustment in 15yrs. Wonderful.

@catwytch @brassiest saaaaaaaame. Shit is bad news over here too lol
@brassiest nope, bc douches are toxic to the vaginal environment. ;)
Like maybe we'll actually be able to start the seeds and early crops in late February like a normal year.
The holidays went really well and the winter already can't possibly be anywhere near as bad as last year bc it's been so mild for so long.
I think we're all going to get healthier and happier and the farm is going to take off. That is literally all I want anyway tbh.
It just kind of feels like we're turning a corner finally, I don't know, I'm tentatively positive.
I think 2015 is going to be a big and significantly less crappy one for me and my family.
But oils are NOT a replacement for the flu vax, antibiotics or psych meds.
They are a wonderful thing to use as daily health maintenance or instead of OTC cold meds for example.
I love essential oils and use them for as many things as possible but they are NOT a replacement for rx meds or vaccines omg omg omg

@catwytch @coyote_witch I literally had to learn to "relax my butt" so I would stop triggering my sciatica with butt tension.
@catwytch But I'm really worried that I'm pre-diabetic or leaning towards diabetes bc that happens too, especially after HG. :/
@catwytch It would be amazing if it was as simple as taking a thyroid pill=magic weight loss, lol.
@catwytch If cleaning up my diet and getting active again doesn't help over the next month, I'm going to get my thyroid checked.
@catwytch My late maternity clothes are starting fit again. :(
@catwytch ...than I did while pregnant. I am so disgusted with myself, it's awful.
@catwytch My metabolism is SHIT thanks to the hyperemesis gravidarum and being bedridden for a year so I've put on more weight postpartum...
@catwytch Next week, I'm getting serious about cutting the junk/gluten.
Upping the iron and cutting the sugar in my diet.
Added blackstrap molasses to my daily oatmeal instead of brown sugar or maple syrup and it's reeeeeally good.

@OaklandElle IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR!
Diffusing grapefruit oil this morning to try to bring some uplifting vibes to this dreary day.
I thought for a while about being a funeral director bc of how good and kind the FD we had for my dad was.
It would be amazing to be able to turn all of my closeness with death into something that could help people.
And holy crap, I think I'd be good at that.
So, completely changing the subject, I just learned that there are baby loss/stillborn/miscarriage doulas.
@brassiest Whenever we used to have my nephew around a lot I would say "family fun" instead of fuck, lol lol lol
@brassiest I feel like I'll be saying flipping, fudge, freaking and crap A LOT on Christmas, lol.
My whole life is a long string of obscenity so how do I curtail my cursing for Christmas while my kid is being a monster?
He's going to think we are fucking devilspawn.
Mom's boyfriend, a preacher, is coming to Christmas at my house on Thursday and I'm just like fuuuuuuuudge.
Fave this if you spend every day thinking WTF I did not sign up for this shit.
I feel guilty because I spend all day every day wearing earplugs, but I was starting to suffer hearing loss from his shrieking.
Every morning I wake up and think okay, Sage got a ton of sleep, he's going to be sweeter today and then he screams every minute he's awake.
A cup of coffee got spilled on the (white) carpet. Remembered reading about salt and club soda and holy shit it works guys.
@brassiest I have elevation and citrus bliss arriving on Tuesday and I will report back.

Last year was the first time I got a flu shot and I did not get the flu for the first time in memory so that's a cool thing.
Today, today I get a flu shot or something.
Good lord, Galaxy Quest is about 3000x better than I remember.

@brassiest I was feeling really bitter and uncared for again and I was like nope, that's not true bc Evan is always there for me.
@brassiest noooooooo. No. What I'm upset about is so childish it's not worth talking about.
@brassiest I'm sorry you are in pain but just knowing I can count on you for kindness turned my day around. You matter.
@brassiest me too. I'm very angry and hurt about something but then I remembered how caring you are and what a sweet friend.
Why on god's green earth do people blow a fucking gasket at others acknowledging the existence of the other holidays?
This is indisputable.
Like, there are literally several other holidays that happen around the same time as Christmas.
I think of all the weird hangups ppl have, the weirdest are ppl who get really pissed off that ppl say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Xmas.
@OaklandElle rude, liz.
@brassiest Same with Maggie. She is sooooo loving. Every person she meets is her favorite person of all time.
@brassiest sobbing tbh
@shareefali Activity mats are fucking magic i swear. Sage needs no other toys.

@caulkthewagon Ben has a lot more natural patience and problem-solving curiosity bc he was allowed to explore game-play as a child, I think.
@caulkthewagon Yeah, our family was a WE PLAY TO WIN OR DON'T PLAY AT ALL family. Very happy to NOT pass those values on to Sage.
@caulkthewagon Like if you're a grandmaster level chess player like my dad was, maybe tone it down for 5yo, idk.
@caulkthewagon I think it's important to sometimes let your kid win, especially when they are first learning so they can grow interest tbh.
@caulkthewagon Yeah. That's how I was raised.
@caulkthewagon But also parents who delight in crushing their kids' souls through games, super not cool
Kind of wondering if I should get my iron levels checked because I'm so bone tired and depressed.
So excited to make mulled wine for Christmas. Christmas Day menu also includes my ale-chipotle chili, kale salad and a million cookies.
How early is too early to start drinking and if I call it "a-wassailing" does it count as a holiday festivity?

I know I always post cute pix and videos of #babysage but this is what 90% of his waking time is… 
I joke but I'm actually really fucking sad about never having anymore kids bc Sage is so awful.
Just punch me square in the face if I ever get the baby rabies again.
Anyone need to be scared out of ever having p in v sex again? Come to my house this week.
Brb getting my tubes ties.
Omg this kid has been a shrieking demon since vaccines. He is trying to kill me.

I should bust out my SAD lamp in the mornings otherwise I'm going to be useless until well after the solstice.
Ugh, I miss the sun. It's been cloudy for weeks with no sign of changing anytime soon.

@Mike_hugs you and @bdbreedlove should commiserate.
Sage turned four months old on Sunday and this is what has been on my mind as this season of my life speeds by: 
@coyote_witch I think they mustn't load it with msg anymore. RIP MSG
@coyote_witch I had a serious craving for that dip the other day but it tasted nothing like I remember from my youth. T_T
@pinkness the balance of retaining your identity as a sexual being under the pressures of parenthood.

On the occasion of Sage's four month birthday: 
@pinkness noooooooo
@catwytch And my brother started chasing and beating me with sticks/brooms when he was like 2. D:
@catwytch babies are strong! D: Sage is constantly clawing me with his razor nails.
So now I'm going to eat oatmeal every day for breakfast this winter.
Like, the directions to do so are on the oats, I just never noticed. Wow. A+ self good job
It's only taken me 30yrs but i just learned you can make "instant" oatmeal in the microwave with just normal oats.
@pinkness T_T
@pinkness I def wish we could have another adult in the picture, for serious.
@pinkness I can't even imagine being sick with a bunch of kids though, you poor thing. &lt;3
@pinkness Also, praise formula in all of it's glory.
@pinkness I'm so happy it's the weekend and Ben can do the heavy lifting with taking care of the baby.
Not much congestion, but body aches, sore throat, fucked up ears. Blah.
Ugh, I caught Sage's cold. No wonder he's been a butt all week. This is miserable. T_T
@shareefali lol same
Wtf is ninjago and why is my nephew obsessed with it?

@catwytch Add it to the list of reasons I'm fucking pathetic.
@catwytch I have no idea how I will get a haircut in the next 6 months, tbh. I live in the middle of nowhere, can't drive, have an infant.
@catwytch Meh, too much money and effort for no reason. And my hair looks like shit, style-wise, because it's a buzz growing out.
tfw you have an amazon cart full of everything necessary to dye your hair magenta but realize no one is ever going to see you anyway.
@brassiest STAAAAAAAHP
No 8 years ago, not 10.
He was always trying to protect everyone from the shit he was in instead of reaching out for help.
Feeling soooooo old now. His kid was an infant when we dated.
This was 10 years ago and it still feels like yesterday. His kid is in junior high now.
I will never get over having gotten so "busy" that I drifted from Dave long enough to not know that he felt so desperate and alone.
@NikiSparkles ew.
@NikiSparkles What an abusive piece of shit. &gt;:[
He was a really good, sweet, gentle person. The most gentle and flawed person.
I was always really angry at my friend for hanging himself despite having a kid but I get it, I get it, I get it. I miss him.
Drinking wine and blasting interpol, thinking of every death I've ever been around. Regressed back to 24.
@hostilehottie Don't know how militant you're going for but I like "Arm up, shoot back."
@alexismilana diluted peppermint oil in a spray bottle. Pleasant smelling and deadly.

We definitely have a kid who can nap on his own now (and flip himself on his belly whenever he wants).… 
Mark today down as the day I actually got a promoted tweet even remotely related to my interests.
@catwytch dm'd you
@brassiest Perf.
@feral_ghost I don't think anyone I know does anymore? But they better not after this. &gt;:[
@OaklandElle Can't exactly up and leave the farm now. I put all my eggs in the wrong basket. /pun
@OaklandElle eh, I'd rather be back in the fray. Leaving was a huge mistake. Miss you and @Faustrate and @coyote_witch so much it hurts.
(I know that was a bit of a whiplash tweet but here she is being brave while I'm whining about laundry and my shitty life.)
.@OaklandElle is all things amazing, brave and strong. And the type of friend that anyone would be luckiest to have. Always proud of her.
And apparently I'm the only person capable of doing laundry or cleaning up after him so that's what I get to do now. Joy.
I'm so fucking sick of this shit. Because I'm not having a shitty enough day, my kid just projectile vomited all over me and the bed.
Everything has fallen apart and I want out.
I can't even tell you how many times this week people close to me have told me they don't care about me.
My needs don't matter, my health doesn't matter, my goals don't matter. My interests are petty and I am nothing but automated childcare.
Every single day this week has been completely fucked for me. Everyone is making it very clear that i am not an actual person who matters.
Still waiting for the good diapers to arrive, have only used a few pampers and Sage already has a rash from all the nasty chemicals. &gt;:[

@feral_ghost When it's a normal, non-bundle order, it takes way less time. It should be the opposite, imo.
@feral_ghost Maybe I should call them and see if there's something that can be done to speed up the "processing" phase.
@catwytch I feel like "gentle parenting" is such a  joke. The kids who need it most make it the hardest for you to do.
@catwytch Because shouting about it helps soooooooo much. &gt;.&lt;
@catwytch Oh been there, been there. Or just being like "WHAT?! WHAT?! WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG THIS TIME OMG?!"
@catwytch We still have to use the shield but even with the shield, it's horrendous, that rage-pop
@catwytch I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS
@catwytch We always try to BF but if he's being a little jerk about it, no more tears, just some formula or some pumped milk.
@catwytch so now my nipples aren't destroyed from him constantly biting and popping off in a rage so the BFing is much more pleasant.
@catwytch yeah that was the final straw. When he would just scream and rage at the boob I was finally like, here's a fucking bottle, kid.
@catwytch Yeah, i remember that nightmare. D:
@catwytch It seems like everything is too much for him. Nursing is too much, music is too much, lights are too much, books are too much
@catwytch When the colic completely ended, suddenly everything that helped made him lose his mind.
@catwytch The overstimulation thing really started around Thanksgiving. We still have no idea what sets him off.
@Faustrate As a closet Rammstein fan, I feel these feels. "I'm not a neonazi their grammar is just impeccable and German is beautiful!"
@catwytch At least with Sage disliking nursing as much as I do, weaning won't be too rough, I'm hoping.
@catwytch O_O oh dear.
@catwytch But they don't have that belief for dad so they aren't so angry at them, lol.
@catwytch I think there is an inborn belief in babies that mom can fix anything and when we can't for HN, they punish us.
@catwytch Yeah, halfway through colic, I learned about HN so at least I knew I wasn't wanting to die over dealing with a normal baby.
@catwytch I think the last time I showered and went outside was Monday.
@catwytch Oh yeah, Sage is "an angel" for my mom. &gt;:[
@catwytch Maybe it's a Mort thing, bc Ben was apparently like this too.
@catwytch That's exactly how it is right now. He only likes Ben and screams most of the time with me and will only sleep in my arms.
@catwytch I feel so guilty about how amazing it was to give up exclusive breastfeeding. Formula is like a gift from god.
@feral_ghost We've subscribed, too, but it takes 10 days from when the monthly order is put in until we actually get it.
@feral_ghost Over here, they're shipping out of PA so for whatever reason it takes 5 biz days to process and 3-5 days to ship.
@catwytch I had no idea E was high needs, but you saying that the other day really gave me hope bc she is such a gentle, caring child now.
@catwytch I don't even know if I can call myself an attachment parent since I'm so miserable and if I could hire a nanny/daycare, I would
@catwytch babywearing supermamas with happy, quiet kids and I want to stab myself.
@catwytch Babywearing has been a nonstarter and my kid is miserable. I see all these blissed out cloth diapering, breastfeeding, skinny...
@catwytch 4 months in and I've had to compromise everything already and we're not even close to thriving. Barely surviving.
