@84arussell hah! Hopeful but not hugely optimistic for tonight. Caps playing really well, Rangers not so much. Credit to your lot though.
@ljmabon @bay_girl86 I would love to think so…
@bay_girl86 best way to start the day (and also I’ve got CPD after work so no time!)
@karenmabon best part of the day!!
Early morning deadlifts are the best 
@block15blaze will periodically bring everyone out of their seats. Can perform magic with the puck. Will drive you nuts when he doesn’t.
@block15blaze he’s batshit crazy, and does seem to take nights off. Huge upside but infuriating at times. Should/could be top 5 in league.
@studiomrmann what a freaking great name. Congratulations again!
@ljmabon @wagonart happy anniversary guys!
@gerryd72 I’ve had a couple of misadventures with it but getting the hang of it now. It was delicious.
@abexlumberg I had never heard of Serial despite listening to podcasts. Love Start Up and have downloaded all of Serial. Using Overcast…
@EilidhWailey amazing!
@r_d_alexander nah, ate at a sensible time. Just felt like sharing.
Slow cooked brisket, sweet potato, onions and spinach #slowcookingrocks 
Hilarious live blog from @benbloomsport - press conference entirely in German. Comprehension :0. Entertainment :lots. 

@ljmabon your ability to quote 70s hockey films amazes me.
@ljmabon the other option is just booking/sending off any players who swear at refs. Would take a few weeks of 5vs5 but they’d learn.
@ljmabon hockey also has only three designated players (C and two As) allowed to “ask officials for clarification”. Doesn’t always work but…


@bay_girl86 Boat House. Really really nice!
@gerryd72 cheers!
@bay_girl86 thanks! Definitely not too early, best time of the day!!
Not a bad view for dinner 
Birthday conditioning workout <FISTED HAND SIGN> 
Fife may be out, but Kevin Hayes is making my Sunday evening a bit better #quickmitts 
@FifeFreePressEd I remember Ian Pound and him throwing down in the anniversary game. Not in those jerseys though so not that photo!
@FifeFreePressEd definitely Gary Wishart and Scott Moody (Jets). Was that the year Bekkering was here?
@gerryd72 I’m no expert but I’d say little and often. If it’s that bad I’d maybe get it checked out though.
@ljmabon “@FootbalIFights: Clearly got the ball 
@cupcakelassie who’s in net?
@cupcakelassie Tim and Jeff been put back together?
@ljmabon slightly, the less fancier of the two though!
@EilidhWailey what’s with you all acquiring two passports?!
@TheFlowEdit @Trevornoah think I’ll have to see him in Edinburgh to make up for it! Hope SA is still treating you well
@ljmabon my bro just texted me. He’s looking at buying a car from a dealership in Gala run by…John Cleland! Thought you’d appreciate.

@r_d_alexander debate what crime against grammar you have to commit to fit it in
@karenmabon what?!?
@r_d_alexander to be fair, it said Aperture will still work fine. Also, does Photos not do what Aperture did?

Decent view for Scotland and Wales this afternoon 
@gerryd72 I know! Times like this I wish I could… There’s always coconut butter though!
@gerryd72 sounds good. Protein is easy with just a shaker, but fresh blended veg vs pack of greens powder is a toss-up.
@gerryd72 any good? Don’t own a blender at the mo…
@karenmabon @ljmabon #obviously
@ljmabon got it! Hard to keep up :-) btw been having some phone network issues, sent you a text the other day but not sure it ever arrived…
@ljmabon are you at the game? I thought you were in Japan for some reason…
@AndiSheach congratulations buddy!

@FifeFreePressEd two weeks in a row. Great stuff. Wonder if @theMdot50 has any influence, maybe not heavy enough though!
@block15blaze game misconducts not always suspension worthy though. Given what’s been let go recently (Frank) this seems harsh.

@bay_girl86 the Apprentice might be ridiculous but I love that guy!
@bay_girl86 I know, including my team’s first line centre! Mental and really bizarre. Ain’t nobody got time fo’ that.
@FifeFreePressEd Markku Maki? 
@FifeFreePressEd nothing on HockeyDB. Maybe one for the archives at the rink! 
@FifeFreePressEd Mo’s first game in charge was also my first game watching, don’t remember any Finns. Could well be wrong though!
@FifeFreePressEd first Finn to play for the Flyers…?
@EilidhWailey @catrionahunter <FISTED HAND SIGN>
@bay_girl86 insane! Almost as crazy as this guy 
@bay_girl86 how I love speaking exams!
@niceasey incredible. Did this not occur to anyone??
@bay_girl86 that is not cool!
Outrageously good performance by @passengermusic and @theonceband in Edinburgh tonight. Awesome.
@EilidhWailey hope you enjoyed the game last night #notjealousatall
@EilidhWailey didn’t expect to bump into them at the bar, no! Turns out Natália is a big fan and he’s growing on me too!
@EilidhWailey I’m at a Passenger gig and just bumped into your parents…
@bay_girl86 ha! Not quite. It was freezing and I was half asleep…also not wearing a Lycra onesie like actual Mr Motivator!
Best way to start the day #squats 
@r_d_alexander I’d take a look at @timbuk2 - practical and virtually indestructible.
@bay_girl86 this is brilliant! Using this  tomorrow…
Cracking evening’s entertainment @ @kevinbridges86 and friends last night.Kudos to @ClydebankCowboy for taking it so well! #clydebankcowboy
Friday night, @gaslightanthem show in Edinburgh. Freaking awesome 
@84arussell outstanding!
@84arussell please tell me this actually happened.
Awesome @gaslightanthem performance in Edinburgh tonight #ringingears
Got an extra ticket to @gaslightanthem at the Corn Exchange in Edinburgh tonight. £25 or your best offer!!
@rocknic1985 yup! Taking a few folk as well. Should be good! Hopefully see you there
@rocknic1985 true #notsurewhyimcomplainingifimhonest you going to Gaslight Anthem on Friday?
@rocknic1985 nice!! I was going to order one but am running an exchange to Munich that week!!
@84arussell aside from that one. Obviously. #actuallyitsthestreetshavenonamebyU2 #sometimesgunsnroses
@84arussell or, indeed, a Scottish folk duo who sang the unofficial flyers/Kirkcaldy anthem “Geordie Munro”. Same name, sadly not us.
@84arussell as is the proper way, surely. I’d have said worse.
@84arussell I feel your pain. Looks like my brother beat me to it though…!
@84arussell thanks!
@84arussell ooh, link please! I use the Tagesschau sometimes but the more he merrier!
@84arussell oh, and I’ll let you have this one on THF. Shout if you get bored arguing sensibly and pointing out the obvious.
@84arussell have done so in the past. Didn’t go so well. Have started them off with some Bayerisch to ease them in…
@bay_girl86 had to double take there and work out who the hell you were!!
One timer from last weekend. Possibly the only hockey photo where I look remotely decent #itwenttopshelftoo 
@ljmabon 
@84arussell who was that? #mostbritishpoliticianscantdothatsortofthing #wunderbar
@gerryd72 nice. Teaching related?
@gerryd72 cool! What’re you studying? #lovelearningnewshit
@84arussell one of my favourite places in the world. Enjoy!!
@lily__munster boom!!
@r_d_alexander use something like MPRG streamclip to change format…?
@r_d_alexander download VLC, it plays pretty much everything.
@tferriss my copy has those sections in it and I bought it in the UK…
@Sticki_Nic amazing!!!! Congratulations!!!
@niceasey was expecting more from guys like Tendler and O’Marra though, who although got assists (one was added at a break) I barely noticed
@niceasey they were effective but dull last night. Five guys stacking the slot and a superb netminder meant not a lot got through.
@McPhail101 nice!! <FISTED HAND SIGN>
@lily__munster thanks!!! <FISTED HAND SIGN>
@illegaljacks terrible news, absolutely loved your place, had many a great evening there. Best of luck in the future. Big loss to Edinburgh!

@Amateur_hockey two at home, two on the road.
@gerryd72 it certainly will be if it’s anything like our SA project!
Kevin Regan, last 4 games, 3 goals from 115 shots, 97.3% save percentage. Outstanding stuff @FifeFlyers #eihl #flyers
@lily__munster <FISTED HAND SIGN>
@FifeFreePressEd not just you, that drives me insane. Even worse is airline "pre boarding"!
Seems apt that this gets delivered on #nationalcoffeeday 
@lily__munster haha! True. Nice guy as well. Can actually play the game pretty well too, not just fight. Solid as a rock in his own end.
@lily__munster big fan? Dude's a beast.
@drdozellodc @BornFitness thanks boys! Appreciate the tips.
@gerryd72 as long as you don't injure yourself it'll be grand. 10k won't help the pain though!
@gerryd72 I get that if I run distance (which I rarely do) but I wear very minimalist shoes and haven't really done much distance running.
@BornFitness any tips for training really early in the morning? Like 5-6AM #askborn
@gerryd72 not really sure. I never manage more than about ten minutes but sore calfs/Achilles are brutal. Will take time. What did you do?
@gerryd72 absolutely true. It works though, even if it makes you cry.
@O2 thanks, I tried swapping browsers and it seems to have worked. Not in a 4G area today but will check it out tomorrow to test it works!
@O2 I'm trying to access the 4G setup page but keep getting a message saying "something went wrong"...any help?
@neilredford #spanishteacherjokes
@neilredford nah, he’s only scored Juan so far.
@Amateur_hockey you played for the Spitfires? Ever play against Edinburgh Uni? Our paths have likely crossed if you did…
@PoetsOfTheFall you guys have to come to Scotland!!
@LeonieLima no danger of that here. I didn’t even bother with shoes. #homegymbestgym #breakfastofchampions #morningworkoutsrock

Incredible performance from the Dloko High School choir #townshipvoices @ARedinburgh have known them for a long time but still blown away…
@grantf good luck!! I’m sure it’ll be an amazing experience.
@EilidhWailey your tweets this week have been awesome! When are you leaving? #ohcanada
@r_d_alexander well done!! Glad you’re still in one piece!
@gerryd72 same, except I’ve not watched the series yet. 20% through book two…
@EilidhWailey this is the most Highlands thing I’ve ever read.
@JabulaniProject great write up in the Independent today as well 

@LeonieLima as in food? Probably not as important as total amount and a pain to track, but if you like numbers to stick to then go for it!
@LeonieLima excellent. Totally doable as well #maybeputacushionbelowyourfacejustincase #Ivedonethatbefore

@ljmabon I think white but who knows. Almost as good as this one (zoom in to see the guy’s beret) 
@ljmabon been in France less than a day, seen about 5 old white Renault 5s and this. Thought you’d appreciate. 
@kimberlima well, this isn’t going to end well…
@r_d_alexander how’s this for a view from where we’re staying by the way? 
@r_d_alexander that’s what I meant, not a race but an event! Glad all’s well.
@r_d_alexander that’s a fair bit…when is your next race? Btw tried to call you before we left but couldn’t get in touch, hope all’s well!

“Deutschland über alles” are NOT the words to the German national anthem @BBCsport this gets repeated in every tournament.Do your research!
@ljmabon just saw a thing about the typhoon on the news. Take care of yourself!!

How was the French second goal “controversial”, Jonathan Pearce? If went in, the technology said it went in, it’s not that hard!!
@ljmabon all the Hondurans need to do is pass Debouchy on de left hand side…
Why are the BBC commentators moaning about the goal line technology? Wasn’t in when it hit the post, went over the line after #notthathard

@JWilcoxPhotos btw great job yesterday, great tournament. I had an absolute blast. Was there anyone taking photos at all?
@JWilcoxPhotos it’s a beautiful language, totally under appreciated.
@84arussell @block15blaze also, ref’s explanation was that it happened “after the goal”, not that he was being held.
@84arussell @block15blaze take a look at Pouliot’s interference penalty earlier. Where’s the consistency?
@block15blaze no idea, especially when Pouliot was called for the same thing earlier. Ridiculous.
@grantf wow!! That sounds incredible, congratulations. Big changes indeed!
@MatthewCBurton shed is…?!?#errantapostrophewednesday

"He didn't make much effort to avoid the contact" 
Mon 
"Looking to the incident,…
To think anyone on a breakaway in a 2-0 game in the conference finals wants to do anything other than score is ridiculous. #nyrmtl #nhl
Therrien says it was accidental after the game, now Price is out it was “reckless”.No way in hell was it on purpose, no need to stir #nyrmtl
@Amateur_hockey still, there are more important things in life…
@Amateur_hockey not lashing out, just a bit miffed at missing two goals and not being able to use Game Centre due to the blackout.
@Richard_Parker @PremierSportsTV yup, just the logo and music. Have missed two #nyr goals in the last two minutes!

@neilredford we did the same. Bit more flash than the rink in Kirkcaldy…! Enjoy the game!
@neilredford just curious! Will be a pretty wild atmosphere I suspect. Was at Old Trafford a couple of weeks ago to look around.Pretty cool!
@neilredford United Norwich?
@neilredford you going to the game this afternoon?
@LeonieLima have fun!
@fourthlinewing 33 points in 149 games vs 133 points in 159 games in NCAA. Not writing him off, but the comparison is a bit off…

@kimberlima rank…

@neilredford you watching the game as well…?
@eoghanofficial bull, it’s called looking at both sides of an argument. Dumbing it down like this does it no justice.
@eoghanofficial One side blindly ignores the obstacles, the other blindly ignores the opportunities. Both sides focused on themselves.
@eoghanofficial I disagree. Though you proved my point about the insulting.
@eoghanofficial and to stop habitually insulting those who do not agree with them completely.
@eoghanofficial both sides need to engage with the fact that there are valid arguments on both sides,and debate sensibly within that context
@eoghanofficial exactly, yet like on many issues, one side only talks about the positives and one side only about the negatives.
@eoghanofficial …it does the country a disservice and makes it more difficult for people to make an informed choice.
@eoghanofficial That's been my objection all along. Both sides mislead the public with BS rhetoric without any quality debate and…
@eoghanofficial …without looking at what *might* happen. Nobody knows for sure, on either side, and to say for sure otherwise is misleading.
@eoghanofficial I never doubted that we'd be in the EU, but I think it's wrong to make out that it is a done deal…
@eoghanofficial If such is the case, the country would have to go through "some form" of accession process and negotiate terms of membership
@eoghanofficial The article states "The paper states that an independent Scotland would be regarded as a new state. That's far from certain"
@eoghanofficial that’s pretty much exactly as I’ve been saying. Nobody knows, and it’s disingenuous and misleading to claim otherwise.
@eoghanofficial so we would still have to commit to joining the Euro and Schengen, and the terms of our membership are total unclear.
@LeonieLima sounds good. Make sure he’s a decent PT and you’ll be grand!
@LeonieLima cool! Make sure they know what they’re doing! Was it a DEXA scan or the one where they dunk you in a tank? Just curious.
@LeonieLima interesting! Aren’t they really expensive? Or maybe not if you work in a hospital…

@gerryd72 functionality? Not sure I agree - it does everything I've ever needed it to. Agree about stability and price though
@GerryD72 politely disagree - much better than anything else I’ve used in many ways! Not for everyone though.
@GerryD72 cmd-c / cmd-v?  Should work, but drag and drop works fine on mine too…
@GerryD72 drag and drop?

@neilredford I’m sure using twitter is helping…
@seonaidh14 unless he’s in that Bond film when he makes the guy explode in the pressure chamber. Maybe he was referring to that.

@r_d_alexander anyway, at least the football team aren’t terrible anymore…
@r_d_alexander the rest of us have to suck it up, he’s no different! It builds character #mustbesomebenefitsomewhere
My mother just used asterisks to blank out profanity in a text message #signsofapoorrefereeatahockeygame
@GerryD72 what a film #bestoutofallofthem
@ljmabon to be honest, if Fashanu and Ulrika aren’t on the other side, what’s the point…
@ljmabon that looks impressive. Well done! I shall attempt to read it!
@ljmabon I have never seen a real life travelator. Is it actually the same thing?? Amazing.
@kimberlima happy birthday Kim!! <CLINKING BEER MUGS>
@ljmabon 
Faceplanted over a box mid-lesson today #epicfail
@Sticki_Nic that looks nothing like you!!
@seonaidh14 He also penned this beauty. "Zur Zeit jeder Tag wie/
Ein Mac Miller Lied/
Obwohl ich Mac Miller nie dope fand"
@seonaidh14 No idea. Crazy Germans. He's a bit weird (but actually decent. I think I won him some new fans). 
@84arussell nice. Much appreciated.  Will definitely use that!
@neilredford @eurhc man up #hustle
@seonaidh14 This might cheer you up. Played it in class yesterday. 
@LeonieLima makes no sense…


What a photo.
Fireworks! 
@lr_gray makes up for you not being on Facebook!
@ljmabon this is excellent. I’d obviously never invent verbs from nouns like that of course. How’s Japan?
@seonaidh14 #westside #morningside
@84arussell brilliant, thanks for that!
@ljmabon  for yelling rather too enthusiastically at the ref. Guy can play though. At least we scored some goals! Last night - barn door…
@JurajKoudelka 4-0 against a winless team. Brutal!
@JurajKoudelka awesome. You?
@eoghanofficial common misconception. Eggs are not bad for you in the slightest and neither is ghee!
@lily__munster nope, but I found it in the world foods section of Tesco!
Discovery of the day: eggs cooked with ghee taste amazing.
@ljmabon I watched that race. Good stuff. YouTube?
@eoghanofficial hundert prozent schottisch.
@eoghanofficial bite me
@GerryD72 very true. He also seems to enjoy trousers that are altogether more snug than I’d be comfortable with.
#educatingyorkshire is reminding me why I love my job. Brilliant teachers, showing the hard work they put in for the kids. Great stuff.
@SlapshotScot not at that speed. DaCosta was vulnerable, no need to hit him. Hitter’s responsible. Similar suspensions in the NHL, easy call
@r_d_alexander should definitely be excited about that!!
Kaleta’s third suspension in the last 18 months, serial headhunter. And apparently it’s guys like Hertl who “disrespect the game” #idiots
@andyleask to be fair, porridge and coffee have now also been had!
@RichardCLeslie and experience on the old.
Best way to warm up on a cold Saturday morning! 
@GerryD72 …about two feet away. Muppets. I love to reminisce though!
@GerryD72 that’s Glaswegians for you. That game was a year or two ago. What you don’t see is the **** smacking a puck at my brother from…

Joe Thornton comes out with possibly the greatest sports quote of all time :

@GerryD72 sadly that’s my team he’s embarrassing. Beauty of a goal though. And he’s a rookie. Takes some balls to try something like that!
Whoever writes the headlines on 
“Teenage mutant ninja Hertl”. #takeabow
@RichardCLeslie potentially, but not sure if it’s only temp - I spent 4 years trying to be made permanent!!
@RichardCLeslie Does that mean your PT job is getting advertised? Or internal acting type thing... (just out of interest... ;))
@RichardCLeslie Wow, congratulations. Onwards and upwards indeed, though shame you missed out on the DHT job at GHS. New job sounds great!
@RichardCLeslie new job? Where are you off to? Congratulations!

@rocknic1985 they’re still around! Based in the States I think, and still awesome!
@eoghanofficial what time are you on?
@bananaheaded I remember that tea and coffee are both good for you :)
@FredaMackay interesting! Let us know how you get on!
@karenmabon got it. Either way, I’m sure you’ll keep me entertained! How’s things?
@karenmabon I’m expecting some of the same outlandishness as your old blog…
@ljmabon first game of the year and one of our new boys turns out to be a total lunatic. Like, unhinged.
Nickerson had done the intimidating stare down. No need to get tossed for assaulting someone. Wrong time wrong place.
@lily__munster sounds good! I’m going for minimalist at the moment as I’m dead busy. Teaching myself snatches as well though!
@lily__munster not front squatted in a whole. They are brutal though!
Spanish final assignment, heavy deadlifts, and Flyers vs Devils tonight #plan #couldbeworse
@84arussell amazing. Hope it’s on YouTube, my advanced higher class will love it. I can’t believe he gets to do that!!
@GerryD72 one and the same.
@GerryD72 I remember discussing it with my orange haired Glaswegian history teacher the day afterwords… #smallworld

@GerryD72 good deal. Thinking of doing something similar, although my current car at £175 a year isn’t as bad. £30 would be nice though…
@RichardCLeslie I fear you’ve been hacked…
I don’t like the Bruins much, but this is epic. Campbell breaks leg, finished shift to kill a penalty…

How on earth does Duncan Keith get a suspension when Mike Green got nothing for his much more brutal crosscheck to the face...?!
@ljmabon haha! I shall. Thanks, we’ll let you know and have you over once write sorted! Btw I need some car advice…can I email?
@ljmabon nice! Realised we’ve not seen you guys in too long! We’re moving house this weekend but will have you guys round when we’re sorted!
@ljmabon where are you off to? Sounds exotic…
@r_d_alexander nice! Hope the move went well. Will try to call this week if I can find my phone under all the boxes…

@LeonieLima <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
@eoghanofficial they're right. The tram is just so convenient I don't know why I need to drive...
@seonaidh14 that would explain a lot.
@84arussell that said, I'll watch it in full later and comment further.
@84arussell no need for penalties to be even, if the Caps commit more infractions they'll be penalised more.
@84arussell officiating has been bad but hasn't favoured either side over the whole series IMO
@84arussell MDZ's hit was a bit late but not high or late. Also, NY have two guys who have been concussed by boarding/elbowing penalties...
@84arussell justifiably, but I still don't buy the slewfoot. Don't see the intent. Green is a dumb making that play though.
Can't believe Mike Green whining about the "dangerous play" on him last night, as if the crosscheck to the teeth he dished out is fine...
@misswiz those are awesome. Didn't realise you knew him! Looks a bit different these days...
@eoghanofficial ¡viva la revolución, hermano! #notaslongadrivetofreedom
Excited for game 5 tonight. Not hugely optimistic but hopefully the Caps can replicate some of this defensive play...

@Sticki_Nic just checking! Have a good Friday! #studyleave
@Sticki_Nic interview?!
@RichardCLeslie very similar. We're doing ours soon. Made booklets so they can research their talks, but pretty similar.
@lily__munster any excuse :-)
Good win though. But if the NYR keep letting the Caps' point men run around freely they're going to get killed. Need to be harder to play.
Never like seeing hockey players sell calls by throwing their heads back. Ovechkin's better than that...
Good enough for Wolverine, good enough for me…

@ljmabon definitely. Excellently written!
@rocknic1985 thanks! Certainly passed the time. Think my comments were much more blunt than normal though.
I think having Rage Against the Machine on while marking today made me a little harsher #testify
@RichardCLeslie they could deliver it to my new house?
@LeonieLima I love it! Thanks! Similar one for coffee...

@ljmabon incidentally, I just read your Tokyo blog. Brilliant, really good stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
@ljmabon absolutely. They were amused at Lewandowski getting kicked up and down the park too-imagine if the foreigners did that to Gerrard..
@kimberlima easy is boring!

@GerryD72 I know - was just pointing out it wouldn't save the cooncil any money...
@GerryD72 didn't mean to retweet that. Not sure how to undo it! #toooldforthisshit
@GerryD72  to be fair, Edinburgh schools start 20 mins earlier each day so teaching time works out the same...

@RichardCLeslie almost…on another note, are you guys going to the multilingual debate at HW on Wednesday?
@RichardCLeslie He did not. He did start "one doesn't want to speak ill of the dead, but…"…though

@niceasey that's how it's done! #nothingbeatsit
Love a big workout after work #squats
@GerryD72 as it tends to make you much lighter in your stride, less impact. Not a lot of use at the moment though, tbh. Rest and recover!
@GerryD72 evidence is anecdotal, but I know folk who have starter minimalist/barefoot running gradually and gotten over injuries...
@GerryD72 that sucks, you have my sympathy. Might sound crazy but once recovered you could try to transition to less supportive shoes...
@GerryD72 torn?? How did you manage that?! Got to include some active recovery after runs, once you're healed try a foam roller out...

@ChrisShugart come to Europe, they still are here. My gym doesn’t let me lift without footwear…
@grantf what’s Klasse? I’d be tempted so will ask at school on Monday if nobody else has called dibs by then!
Skyfall is brilliant.
@Catriona_Hunter nah, no need to do that, I’m sure I can find some here. Thanks for the offer though <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Catriona_Hunter where did you get that? I love green tea and leaf tea!
@Adam27Keefe as a fan who's interested in strength/conditioning, I'm curious-who's got the biggest squat/DL on the Giants? Just wondering…
@rachel3kirk pub beats football stadium, the way I see it! #awesomeplaceforexams
@ljmabon pretty much, although there are far worse places!! Like your magical mystery Fife bus tour last week demonstrated…
@ljmabon saw this picture in a tourist guide and thought of you… 
The Open University certainly pick weird locations for their exams.

It pains me to say it, but the St. Andrews athletics union gym is an excellent facility #somanysquatracks #dontneedtowaitforequipment
@FiferTHF perfect, thanks!
Fife fans help me out - what’s the name of the song that the players skate out to this season? @FifeFlyers @Fifeneebs @FiferTHF
Fife fans help me out - what’s the name of the song that the players skate out to this season?
@craig_s96 fair result though. Work ethic and coaching was the difference between the two teams IMO
@craig_s96 8. Jason Pitton is injured.
“@craig_s96: Mike Danton latest blog on the UKBA decision etc: 
@craig_s96 Ah, did not know that! Makes a bit more sense now…
@craig_s96 @stuthebadger I know that's not necessarily a short term solution,but surely young British players need experience for success?
@craig_s96 @stuthebadger Fair enough. Though Griffin and Cowley are both listed as D. If Brits leave, got to replace/develop some more!
@craig_s96 @stuthebadger Not saying Blaze haven't been hit hard with injuries - they have - but I still think they started light up front.
@craig_s96 @stuthebadger Balance is fine, but depth up front isn't. Only 9 forwards is short,and everyone has to count on injuries happening
@StutheBadger @craig_s96 even fully fit you guys only had 8/9 forwards to start the season.
@StutheBadger @craig_s96 forgot about Cowley, sorry. With hindsight though, extra import forward and one fewer defence could’ve worked.
@StutheBadger @craig_s96 why sign a defenceman like Olson and play him as a forward? Should’ve thought about this beforehand…
@mattelder_ffp good effort, but not quite at Belfast’s level. Belfast well drilled, their neutral zone trap was very effective!
@LeonieLima just checking :)
@LeonieLima when he’s not beating up women, I take it…?
@grantf great job today, really enjoyed it once again! Cheers, see you next time!
@RichardCLeslie quite possibly - we’re still developing S3 stuff. Cheers for sharing. I can reciprocate with S1/S2 stuff if you want…
@RichardCLeslie nope! 99 quid to upgrade, even I can manage maths like that :)
@RichardCLeslie ¡Muy bien!
@RichardCLeslie phone recycling website! Like mazuma…
@LeonieLima sorry, languages teacher… <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@LeonieLima they’re not literally bleeding…
@RichardCLeslie I was only winding you up :) glad you’re enjoying the perks of modern life! How’s life in the costa del Kirkcaldy?
@RichardCLeslie a happy coincidence. End of contract + envirofone = free upgrade!
@RichardCLeslie wouldn’t have pictured you as an iPad owning twitter user when we first met…
@bananaheaded not perfect but good for stock earphones! 
New iPhone is awesome. Love it. Even comes with decent earphones (which it just auto corrected to earpods…)
I do love German.  
@BenHeathcote I noticed you rocking the beard and long hair combo. I like it!
@lily__munster free? Seems worth it, who cares about how it looks?! Hehe.
@lily__munster If it's not too expensive then for sure. Maybe not from a 4S but if it's a free upgrade (like mine!) then go for it!
Just picked up my shiny new iPhone 5. It's excellent. And I made 80 quid by upgrading/envirofoning #result
@BenHeathcote I had a mate who did that once, and his last name made a cracking nickname… #twophonesjones
@BenHeathcote I just picked up my new iPhone #saltinthewound
@bananaheaded Guess so! Can't stop singing it...
@bananaheaded indeed. It is. And insanely catchy. Not my normal cup of tea but…
@bananaheaded can’t work out why I like that song…
@martinrooney1 love it! Hope you’re enjoying Scotland. At least it isn’t raining!
@DundeeStarsBlog Seems Hutchins says he's game to game at the moment, I'd suspect he'll stick around though.
@DundeeStarsBlog Guess he's on a sort of trial then…he'd be decent depth but you guys could possibly do better. Depends on money though...
@GreenladyK alas no! Gym in the morning then Spanish afterward…how’s things? Need to catch up soon. Not seen you since your wedding!!
@DundeeStarsBlog not too bad indeed, just being informative :-) what’s up with Cingel though?
@DundeeStarsBlog and two others, apparently. Both import forwards.
@misswiz that looks awesome! How likely is that you get it funded?
@misswiz how do you do that? I should do the same! Had a week as part of my course this summer and loved it!
Loving using the wife's iPad a bit too much...
@misswiz me too! Best way to do it...
@misswiz and my current/new/permanent job is German/Spanish so I sort of have to. Am currently teaching beginners Spanish and love it!
@misswiz OU diploma. The Dundee one looks great but timing wasn't good for me and the OU one is recognised and slightly quicker.
Ironing and practising Spanish direct/indirect object pronouns #multitasking
Part one of Self Improvement Saturday done, time for part two!
“@blair_daly: Loving the new wheels @GarrettZemlak 
@FifeFlyers Love the name bars, and that finally somebody is wearing my number #6
@FifeFlyers Mark Morrison. Failing that, Greg Kuznik!
This is confusing…

Strength training and sprints are an excellent way to start the weekend. I may hurt tomorrow.
I did not know you had to poach bagels before baking them #bakeoff

@LeonieLima I’d try to get your phone back off your sister if I were you…
@ahrdennis that looks epic. I also approve of your newfound use of Twitter, btw. How the hell do you make those?!
I find the twitter hero worshipping of Mike Danton by some UK hockey fans more than a little bit weird. Great guy? Role model? Ok then…
Sun shining, fresh pot of coffee, nice bit of breakfast, faintly sore from yesterday's workout. Pretty good start to Sunday so far.
@misswiz haha,cool. In service I'm guessing? I saw some of them at a wedding over the summer, it's been a while! Hope term has started well!
Wicked show by @trevornoah at the Pleasance tonight.
I’ll take a goalie who was sat on an NHL bench two years ago in Fife. Even better that his bro is joining him!
@jaypitts17 you’re gonna love it! Welcome to Fife!
@LeonieLima awesome dinner!
“@chrishoy: Hilarious pic of @GeraintThomas86 no.2; Chillin with his close personal friend Arnie. 
Not Jessie J. Please.
Always look on the bright side of life + bagpipes = awesome
Eric Idle serenading the entire world. Could not be more surreal.
Bit of ELO now, decent choice!
Bunch of hammered athletes singing Wonderwall #classic
Jesus, Boris dancing…
@LeonieLima dude is wearing an orange jacket and sunglasses at night. Seriously?!
Jessie J singing (badly) about it not being about the money. Standing in a Bentley #needsomepropermusicsoon
Russell Brand should start singing “The Clap” #gethimtothegreek
Ah, Annie Lennox. Bumped into her in the staff room at work once…
Having Lennon and some of the dross of earlier in the same show…
“You can see the relief on their faces”…or just masses of booze.
Mo Farah, incredible. 4 minute mile and a 52 second last lap. Outstanding.
@LeonieLima 
That should, of course, say “impressed”
Most impresses with the American sprinter who finished his part of the relay, joint first, with a BROKEN LEG. #warrior
Jamaican 1-2-3 was fantastic. Interviews afterwards were almost as good #onelove
Warren Weir manages to out-Jamaican Yohan Blake. “One love Jamaica” - awesome.
@ljmabon nope. That actually happened. I was amazed that nobody battered seven bells out of the guy for it. You just don’t do that…!
@BornFitness knee length gym shorts, t-shirt (dry fit if possible), Fivefingers.
@ljmabon good work, I wish I could see that! In Japanese I assume?
“@chrishoy: Love the fact that every GB gold medallist gets a postbox in their home town painted gold, such a great idea!” @ljmabon
@ljmabon outstanding! I’m down south at the moment so will miss it if it’s on BBC Scotland!
@ljmabon camera crew?!?
@carriveau92 welcome to Fife, you’re gonna love it!
@bbc5live correction - the German national anthem does NOT begin with “Deutschland über alles” - that verse has not been sung since 1945.
Thankfully it wasn’t.
If the guy from Burundi’s time of 3:39 for 100m is true…I’m confident I could do it faster than that, and I suck at swimming.
@JasonFerruggia Braw
@JasonFerruggia thanks. Love the blog by the way, inspirational! Didn’t realise you were half Scottish too!
@JasonFerruggia squats, hang clean +
Press, weighted chinups. Felt good!
@stevezipay objection here is they cut the tribute to lives lost in the London July bombings. There would be outrage if the other way round.
Back in Edinburgh! Hello slightly chilly and damn weather. I’ve missed you.
Bag of beef jerky and a pint of probiotic yoghurt smoothie. Airport breakfast for the win!
@LeonieLima hehe, was in a hotel in Madrid on my way back from my Uni course. Just landed in heathrow!
@LeonieLima chin up Lima <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
That was a surprisingly good sleep. All 4 hours of it. Now flight-bus-flight-car-home. Want to get going!!
Finally at my brief overnight stop in Madrid. Hotel made me wait an hour for a bus that didn’t come, and I only get 4hrs sleep #notimpressed
Free afternoon, so went for an al fresco workout. Hill sprints and pullups in a park. In 30C heat. Got a few funny looks…
Going to miss @BDubi17 and @Anisimov42 playing for the Rangers, great efforts over the last few years from both of them.
@84arussell All good players, but CBJ could've got way more at the deadline when more teams were in the mix.
@84arussell Don't see how the Rangers lose this one tbh. Kept Stepan, Kreider, McDonagh, del Zotto...
@84arussell Overpaid? They offered more at the deadline and got turned down. First line talent for 2nd/3rd line talent.
Rich Nash for Dubinsky, Anisimov, Erixon and a 1st? I'll take that. I like all those guys, but that's a trade you can't hate as a NYR fan.
Entire day of speaking Spanish then a makeshift workout in a tiny wee gym in 30 degree heat. Good day overall!
First day of immersion language course successful #muyintensivo
So Santiago is a beautiful city. Gorgeous old town, great weather #megustamucho
I think I’m the only person staying in this hotel…means a peaceful breakfast though. And there’s freshly ground coffee #awesome
@ljmabon well played! Sorry we missed you last week! Being able to tweet from Spain to Japan is pretty cool… Hope all’s good!
Finally got to Santiago. Hotel has surprisingly quick wifi. I’m knackered and going for a cold shower #hacecalor
Spain tomorrow, a day of airports and hotels awaits!
Packing for my language learning adventure to Spain! #megusta
@Schwarzenegger hang cleans/presses squats and weighted chinups first thing tomorrow morning #spark
@84arussell Good shout! Will see if I can make any of the dates…cheers!
Back from anniversary weekend away up north. It was awesome. Though I did fall off a Segway. While stationary.
Wife came back from lunch with a box of Yerba Mate for me #win
@Simmsey people who know what they’re talking about don’t. He’s very good, aggressive and very competitive. That’s it. He’ll do well though.
@studiomrmann happened to me last week. Disappointing.
@Simmsey misleading headline surely, they’ve not actually signed him…yet.
Zemlak is a good signing for @Braehead_Clan -hell of a competitor and character. Confident @FifeFlyers can find a worthy replacement though.
@LeonieLima that’s ok, just hang out with us during the day instead!!
(I know what you meant before you say it!)
@LeonieLima sweet!!
Congratulations to Federer, phenomenal athlete. Gutted for Andy though, the guy’s a warrior #Wimbledon2012
Headline fail - 
@BornFitness strength training and running at the same time? How to manage/time them so as to maximise progress?
@LeonieLima Happy birthday Leonie!!!
Yes!! #comeonandy
@84arussell asham was cheaper and for all I love prust, he’s not worth that much. Like for like replacement though.
@Amateur_hockey 4 years $10m is too much though.
@Amateur_hockey you should be. Tough, gritty and has “balls the size of the building” according to Torts.
@LeonieLima your Whatsapp conversation with natalia is brilliant!!!
@ljmabon very true! I sort of want to see a 6 second hundred metres though just out of curiosity!Will reply to your email this afternoon btw
@ljmabon I kind of agree. Devalues the “free”  class and lets people have heart attacks by 30 as much as they want!
Surprisingly awake despite being out way later than usual for a school night. Also learned - still can’t dance.
@LeonieLima in other news, didn’t realise you had both!
@LeonieLima your passport is British, not English! At least you could claim to support Scotland. Nae drama with us :-)
@StutheBadger not Dustin Anze Jonathan? :-)
Congratulations!
@ljmabon sounds like a plan, though am busy on Wed/Thu. How about one night next week? We could have you guys over... Nae football though!
Nice of Lawrenson to wish a severe injury on the Italians there #bawbag
@Gerry_Dewar safe trip Gerry, have fun! If you bump into the group from my school then say hello…unlikely but you never know!
"Sunshine Highway" by the Dropkick Murphys just came on shuffle. Belter of a tune.
Training done, pot of coffee being brewed, Spanish assignment coming up #grind
@LeonieLima fair enough, enjoy! #mixinsomedeadlifts
Squat PR, #boom
@LeonieLima Yes! Good choice. Lifting weights is one of the best ways to start the day! Do it!
@LeonieLima Gym! That's where I'm going...
@ljmabon a most excellent list.Made me think about what I'd put on mine…by the way,where are you im Moment? Dinner at ours sometime soon?
@misswiz that sucks balls, happened to me twice. Sorry to hear it!
@d_keller7 welcome to Fife! You’re gonna love it!!
@misswiz good luck! Fingers crossed for you.
@LeonieLima I need a translator #scottishproblems
@ljmabon I am indeed! Absolutely stoked! Where are you off to btw?
Finally got myself a full time permanent job, I’m so relieved!
How I love interviews …
@cameronhunter amazing!!
@Amateur_hockey apparently it’s pretty wild, but I wouldn’t touch the stuff!
@Caisty welcome to Fife, you’re gonna love it!
@r_d_alexander that’s brilliant, and it’s an excellent photo!
@LeonieLima dual Spanish and German  citizenship, one parent from each but born in Germany. His dad is Spanish, hence the name…
@studiomrmann very nice!
@Simmsey they should be, he’ll put up good numbers. Not from Fife though, hence the dislike. They’ll change their mind if he starts scoring!
Jamie Carragher’s scouse punditry is inspired. Don’t think Viera understands a word…
@jessespector or “I’m loving it”, German has no continuous present tense.
Early training session was most excellent. A day of chilling, reading, cleaning, and watching Germany and Portugal later awaits.
Nothing like a post-night-out early morning heavy workout to start off a Sunday. I'm going for a nap now...
Paintballing was awesome, but I am covered in welts. Nice one on the tricep, neck and my chin is covered in paint #youshouldseetheotherguy
Gaborik to have his rotator cuff repaired, out for 6 months. Yup, Europeans are soft and don’t play through pain… #nasty
@LeonieLima how was it??
@kayllaaisha Spanish!
@LeonieLima have fun in Praha!
@Simmsey still need to avenge the 11 goal beating in ‘96. My first ever game that was. Didn’t endear me to Sheffield much.
@Simmsey and we might even beat you this year…!
@Simmsey fair doos, I respect a differing opinion. No need for the teacher abuse though. Give us a shout at a flyers steelers game…
@Simmsey how long have you lived in those countries? I’d say uninformed, not correct. Every country is different. Not just us.
@Simmsey how are the Germans like the Spanish though? Or the Czechs? Everybody’s different. Just like us.
@Simmsey  *could’ve. Typo.
@Simmsey EU is not perfect. But you started this with your stating of incorrect facts. Guess education couldn’t helped you there, eh? :)
@Simmsey not sure what your dislike of teachers is for. If that’s all you’re going to use to insult me I’m doing ok. You’re really reaching.
@Simmsey perhaps not. But blindly ignoring anyone who disagrees with you shows how narrow minded you are.  Nobody’a right all the time.
@Simmsey nice reasoned argument there, genius. Come back when you’ve learned something. I’ve not got time for narrow minded xenophobes.
@Simmsey I know. Imagine the nerve of me educating people and contributing to society. I should be ashamed.
@Simmsey makes you aware of other opinions rather than just what the right wing press feed you.
@Simmsey I like that I’ve got the right to travel and work restriction free in lots of different countries. I have, it broadens the mind.
@Simmsey how aren’t we? EU has good and bad points but telling people we “aren’t european” is, geographicallyand politically, a lie.
@niceasey @Simmsey I know, that’s crazy talk.
@Simmsey which continent is Britain in then? Just cause you don’t want to be doesn’t mean we aren’t…
@ljmabon nice, sounds interesting! Btw al, nat and I have found the best coffee house ever. See my last tweet. You have to try it.
Best cup of coffee I've ever tasted. Artisan roast in Edinburgh, take a bow. 
“Ninja shoes!” : shouts some random at my gym as I walk past #vibramsareawesome
@ljmabon where on earth are you??
Just saw a guy driving around with his windows down blasting "Give it up" by KC and the Sunshine Band #manly
@misswiz Field of dreams, home of legends. So jealous you get to take kids there!
@ejsime worth a go...
@Amateur_hockey rookie mistake. You hate to see it!
@Amateur_hockey brutal. Undoubtedly a rounded back too.
@SlapshotScot fiver says Adam Calder...
@Amateur_hockey watching some guys at my gym makes my spine hurt #clueless
@simmonssteve what do you make of this? 
Mike Danton signs to play in the UK Elite League.
Just heard Gary Neville's epic, filthy sounding scream as Drogba equalised last night. Hilarious.
Beauty.  
Boom!
Rangers look like a different team than the one that started this game #NYRNJD
Mike Milbury really is a dumbass.
Traffic to the net, that's more like it #NYR
@StutheBadger that wasn't clever...
@84arussell It would indeed. I have no particular allegiance being a Fifer, but the (possible) Hibs parade could well go past my flat…
Scottish Cup Final &lt; Champions League Final &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; game 3 of the Eastern Conference Final today! #becauseitstheCup
@84arussell absolutely. I've not been back to Vienna since I lived there, want to go back sometime!
Rainy Friday afternoon, pot of coffee on, Spanish study here I come!
@84arussell Vienna and Edinburgh are two of my favourite cities, good choices!
Great article to read to get yourself psyched, sent to me by @ahrdennis 
@LeonieLima never afraid to try something new! Haha!
Just bought access to NHL Gamecentre. Unlimited playoff hockey whenever I want #becauseitstheCup #LetsGoRangers
Can't get over the fact that the guy on #bbcapprentice is called Ricky Martin.His ad should just be him singing something sleazy in Spanish
Rest day from strength training today, so I go to a freaking yoga class #whatswrongwithme #selfconscious #onlyguythere
@LeonieLima so you should be. Congratulations!
Jon Snow on football coverage on channel 4 - "it's not just about sport, it's about anthropology". What a guy. Love #c4news
@LeonieLima nice!!
“@MirrorFootball: Presentation delayed after official discover Mario Balotelli swapped the trophy for an inflatable banana” @ljmabon
Not even a massive football fan, but that was an incredible end to the season. Gutted for the wife though #unitedfan
@ljmabon sitting watching the GP, coffee maker on in the background. It's like the last 6 years never happened.
@LeonieLima @kayllaaisha hehe, I was kidding. Sort of :-) I'm not a fan of it either but if I complain I feel worse! I just delude myself...
@LeonieLima @kayllaaisha just decide you like your job, you'll feel much better that way!
PJ Stock and Kelly Hrudey on BBC Scotland…wtf??
@ljmabon haha, thanks! It's a week in July. Classes from 9am-9pm for 7 days!! Looking forward to it.
@84arussell a finely fought series. Your boys have totally transformed this year #hustle
Looking at flights to Spain for my residential school in the summer. Both exciting and a bit scary!
Can't spell, that was supposed to say "deadlifts". You'd think my phone would know not to autocorrect that by now.
@lily__munster good kind of pain though! Good work :-)
Heavy deadliest are a great way to start the weekend.
@misswiz thanks! That's ridiculous, I wish i was surprised though! Fingers crossed!
@misswiz got to love Fife! I'm still at the same school, supposedly being made permanent soon...fingers crossed. Good luck to you!
@misswiz never mind!
@misswiz F. Scott Fitzgerald?
@Amateur_hockey we've all been there #epicfail
@LeonieLima is the term "femoral nailing" as brutal as it sounds?!
@ljmabon Fair enough! Think the sub has gone now, which is good. Some Norwegians left it there…how's things with you guys, anyway?
Pienso que voy a hacer huevos pochés…
Day off = gym, coffee, Spanish study, car service. Not too shabby. Pero ahora tengo que comer algo...
@ljmabon and btw a very belated happy anniversary to you both! Need to have you over for dinner soon, not seen you in ages!
@ljmabon I can never tell if you're being sarcastic...
@rocknic1985 must be!
@Gerry_Dewar doubt he'd get away with parking in Leith!
Someone's casually parked a submarine outside ocean terminal ... 
*with- can't type properly...
Long weekend, dinner and cinema when the wife #thisisthelife
Nothing like your team scoring a triple overtime goal 5 hours after the game starts to wake you up in the morning!! #NYRPlayoffs
@LeonieLima welcome back! Good trip?
@SlapshotScot standard at MSG for wins, I believe!
Chris Kreider is freaking awesome #nyrwsh
@84arussell agreed, it's so damn tight when defensive teams are playing like this…
Game 1 about to start, psyched! #NYRWSH
@Josh_Scoon check out a pair of Vibrams, even nicer!
@84arussell congratulations!
@84arussell Semin's physical game as well.
@84arussell on current form, bad hits, officiating, the media, the other coach, the league, the ice, the puck...
@84arussell it seems we meet again...
Game 7 victories are sweet! #NYRPlayoffs
@ljmabon no! Shurely not! I thought he was indestructible!
@84arussell Cheers, I'll take a look at that , thanks for sharing!
@GreenladyK Haha! No danger…
“@BenHeathcote: The Daily Mail supported the Nazi Party in the 30s; seemingly, not a lot has changed since. 
@GreenladyK hah! My gym uses a number.Good thinking though.We've got plenty food,don't worry. Btw do you have draw something on your phone?
Killer morning gym session. Good way to start the day!
@LeonieLima biggest, strongest guy on the pitch and he falls down in a light breeze #footballersareembarrassingsometimes


Why I love hockey, summed up in two minutes.
Two Fat Gripz appeared at my front door this morning, courtesy of @ahrdennis - what a guy. About to hit the gym to test them out!
Seriously contemplating growing a playoff beard, despite the ridiculing I'd suffer at work #NYR #wewantthecup
Back! Sort of, in Gatwick for the next 5 hours...Portugal was awesome!
Lovely evening with great people, great food and a nice glass of wine. Going to Portugal tomorrow, back in a week!
Are you kidding me, Edinburgh?? 
@LeonieLima but so good!
First day of the holidays, hit the gym at 6 #needalife
@LeonieLima fair enough, nat was trying to call them too...
@LeonieLima Nicole says answer your phone!
@LeonieLima funny, cause I'm sitting next to Nicole and she hasn't done it yet :p
Kitchen and lounge stuff sorted, tidied and done. Clothes and spare room next! #getitdonebeforegoingouttonight
@84arussell ha! Thanks buddy!
@LeonieLima thanks leonie! She definitely has :-) x
Spending the evening of my 26th birthday...moving house.
Last day of being 25...
Gorgeous day, meeting outside after work, dinner with people I've not seen in too long tonight. Life could be worse!
“@BornFitness: Who's training today? Share your workout, RT, and motivate others #fitnesslives” Squats, bench, rows, planks #grind
Downloading the new @poetsofthefall album!
Sport Relief, or "wear Vibrams to work day" in my case.
@DundeeStarsBlog "lord it over us"?? Funny man, Mark :-)
The noise level after the 3 fights gave me goose bumps.
Felt and sounded lik ...
On that note,check these out. Big and loud- 
Mellow and chilled- 
Both beautiful @poetsofthefall
Ooh, new @poetsofthefall album out soon. Can't wait to hear it. More people in the UK should check them out, they're brilliant.
Also, NA sports commentators need to learn to speak English - "The Rangers are the shot blockingest team in the league"…seriously?!
I'm no fan of staged fights in hockey, but this was hilarious last night. 
Got to love an old fashioned Rangers Devils line brawl the second the puck drops.
@FiferTHF bit premature...!
Fife have no Hartmanis, Ceman, Maxell, Dutes or Nicholson. #couldbeugly
Now, some of @TSNBobMcKenzie 's book. Later, grilled fish/roasted veg. Could be worse.
And I just discovered that Sky 2 are showing an entire season of 24 today. Amazing.
Going to watch hockey tonight for the first time in a while, looking forward to it. Now, coffee...
Hockey players, keep playing despite broken bones or missing teeth. Footballers, go down holding your face when nobody's touched you #manup
@LeonieLima but they're so good! Brutal, but still fun!
@LeonieLima they're awesome, what are you talking about?!
So Sean Avery's retiring. Shame, he had some great moments in a Ranger jersey (like running Brodeur), despite being a complete tool.
@Simmsey ...which is in which continent? ;)
@Simmsey Where are you from then?
@judithwaller that's still awesome. One day I'll pull off wearing a pair to school!
@judithwaller wore them through an airport last week though. They are green, not very subtle...
@judithwaller to work? That's awesome! Wish I could get away with that. I'm a teacher though...
Work, then gym, then spending 2 hours moving furniture across the city means I'm going to hurt tomorrow #deepburn
@84arussell yup! Damn leftie New Yorkers...
Love that Tim Thomas is blaming the lighting at MSG for the Bruins losing yesterday. Not a sore loser at all...
5 guys in my gym wearing Vibrams this afternoon. Glad to see my awesome taste in footwear is catching on.
Bring back memories of the awesome gig he did in a tiny club in Edinburgh a few years ago. So good.
Kris Roe's live acoustic album is the perfect accompaniment to Saturday afternoon study.
@GreenladyK sounds busy! Got my folks coming over for coffee but that's it for me. And about 4 hours of Spanish stuff...
@GreenladyK I do too sometimes. The other half has hockey so I've got the morning to myself. Carpe diem!
Deadlifts rock, especially before 8am on a Saturday.
Hockey time! First practice in about 3 weeks, going to feel it tomorrow. Psyched though.
@LeonieLima have fun!!
3 weeks' worth of Spanish done in 5 days #megustaelespañol #boom
Bit of a dull #NHLTradeDeadline so far...
Gym was awesome. Going to hurt tomorrow though.
Gym time.
Love that the Irish rugby team has some Dropkick Murphys as their intro music.
Looking through SA pictures to upload. Some great ones. Thankfully the awful ones of me aren't on my camera. Pretend they never happened...
I've done about 7 hours of catching up on Spanish since leaving work yesterday #whydoidothistomyself
@LeonieLima Telling it like it is!
*on
First post South Africa gym session was awesome. Couple of hours of Spanish to catch up in now...eek.
Just about asleep on my desk...
Too much to describe in 140 characters. Amazing people, incredible experience.
16 hours of flights yesterday yet I'm surprisingly awake. Work's going to be tough though...had an amazing time in SA
On the (long) way home from Durban!
Sitting at the gate about to leave, see you in 12 days Scotland!
Too busy to do anything yesterday. Teaching, parents' evening, Spanish tutorial...about to leave for South Africa! Back in two weeks...
@niceasey Good way to be. Just realised I sounded like I was moaning #notreallygotmuchtocomplainabout
Work, gym, cook...
3 days to get ready for going to South Africa, way too much work to do!
@craig_s96 seriously? Barely seen him say a cross word to anyone this season. Obviously Farmer would have him quaking in his boots though...
@84arussell #greatgermanspeakingmindsthinkalike
@LeonieLima that's what it's all about. Just try to enjoy it during, not just after!
Miracle on BBC2 right now. Great hockey film!
@84arussell That's awesome. Brutal looking ice but good stuff! McBride and Siddall with some goals (and a nice celebration from Sidds..)
@Steeler_Kimmi of course. Glad you enjoyed it!
@LeonieLima the gym rocks. Look at it as a reward, not a punishment!
@BornFitness cool, thanks. Distance running a weakness for me too. Slowly starting to run in Vibrams (love them) any tips for transitioning?
@Steeler_Kimmi haha, what did he do this time??
@BornFitness got an invitation to do a tough mudder. Think I should? Any training tips?
@LeonieLima haha, good work! Gym tomorrow for me...
@BornFitness got invited to do a tough mudder in July.  Reckon I should go for it? Any training tips?
@BornFitness nope.They need to live their philosophy, represent what they teach. Wouldn't trust a Spanish teacher who couldn't speak Spanish
@LeonieLima good work! Odd combination of muscles to be hurting though!! What were you doing??
@Steeler_Kimmi loved it! There needs to be more goalie fist pumping.
@Steeler_Kimmi me too, obviously! Not at the game though. Will have to wait for the highlights. Watched last week's show finally. Beauty!
1-0 @FifeFlyers.  Kadic from Bakrlik & Cohen.
@Gerry_Dewar not sure if it'll work, but I know people who have used a foam roller to ease sciatica. Google it. I have one, love it.
@CraigyIceHockey excellent goalie, good potential too. I reckon elsewhere in Europe but would be delighted if we kept him.
@CraigyIceHockey yes on most counts. Good shot at playoffs with a hard working roster,and I reckon Zemlak is young enough to be going places
@Simmsey you mean 2-0 to the @FifeFlyers ??
@Steeler_Kimmi yeah, he got kicked out down in Hull for blockering someone in the face. Think it was Campbell, not sure though!
@Steeler_Kimmi he was. After the first league win there's a pic of him about 4 feet in the air leaping into someone's arms. Love it.
@Steeler_Kimmi quality goalie too. Bat**** crazy but we love him. Goalies should celebrate like that more often!
@84arussell I wasn't aware, thanks! Love a bit of Raab...
@niceasey it sucks. Satisfying though. Hard to remember that when you're walking sideways down stairs, mind.
@84arussell Mikhalek should've sat but Ovechkin is a repeat offender, 3 seems ok to me.
@niceasey I like your style!
@84arussell hehe, I know. Figured EBEL would do business auf deutsch though!
@84arussell in English. Weird.
@woolyanna glad you enjoyed it! The place was rocking like it hasn't in ages Great night.Come back every week if it means we play like that!
@thommoblaze great game, safe trip back to you guys. Delighted to see Fife making profess though. See you next time!
@KimmiSixx yup. Like Dave Phillips tonight. Ropey game all round then ejected for losing it over a 2 min penalty. Got the crowd fired up!
@KimmiSixx hits the back of his shoulder. Reckless, and he aimed for McDonagh rather than the puck. Silly boy.
@DenisKadic nasty move in the shootout! Beautiful!!
What a game! Not heard the old barn rock like that in a long time!! What an effort @FifeFlyers #eihl
“@MensHealthUK: Recent research suggests those who drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day are 15% less likely to suffer from depression.” 
Woohoo!
@84arussell cheers. He's a damn good player, seems he can fight and bang more when he's not having to be a star player.
@woolyanna lots of blue and gold. You won't look biased at all! Oh, and warm socks. Maybe a thermos.
@DukeLukemsEgo cracking picture!
@CraigyIceHockey ignore that. Just saw your last tweet!
@CraigyIceHockey I'm assuming no Cohen for Fife?
@CraigyIceHockey those of us who can't be there appreciate it, cheers!
@GreenladyK sorry! Would have but got engrossed in watching Sherlock instead! Have to have you over for dinner soon though :)
@GreenladyK er...I'm making a rather tasty pasta bake? Cheered me up :-)
@KimmiSixx I know, but they honestly never win there. They habitually play badly there even when they're top of the NHL!
@KimmiSixx NYR never win in Montreal. Ever. Weird.
@BornFitness thanks very much, much appreciated. No rings in my gym but will try out pushup variations and possibly cable work too?
@BornFitness for non powerlifters, is bench necessary in a strength programme? Concerns:re shoulder health + gym equipment. Alternatives?
@GreenladyK already done! I'd suggest people to follow but most of mine are hockey related.You might see some familiar faces in mine though!
@GreenladyK nice picture! You're getting the hang of this :-)
@DukeLukemsEgo hah! Not at all. No more than I've been introduced to the treacherous side of music by owning an iPod...
Loving the Kindle. Reading more than I have done in ages. Some classic Bond this evening - Casino Royale #OldSchool
@niceasey fair enough, I trust your judgements! Wouldn't have called that at the start of the year. Reportedly pricey too...
@niceasey @craig_s96 hardly seen the Blaze this year,is he really that bad?Only time I saw them he had Gordon to make himself look better...
First week of work done #gettin'itdone
10 words people need to stop spelling wrong. Excellent. 
@LeonieLima nae bother ;)
@LeonieLima er, need to have a think! Spent 4 days there about 6 years ago! Will look through photos and see what I can dig up :-)
@LeonieLima it is a lovely city. Wee bit touristy in places but every big European city like that is. How long are you there for?
@LeonieLima Gorgeous city, not been back in years though. You'll love it!
@84arussell that's the one ;)
@84arussell yup, looks like he'll do a good job. EBEL top scorer would be asking a bit much!
@HB_Crunchtime Danke sehr, sehr hilfsbereit von Ihnen! Ich drücke mir die Daumen :-)
@HB_Crunchtime Servus Hannes- ich bin Fan der Fife Flyers und freue mich wenn das richtig ist! Sind Sie sicher? Danke :)
@84arussell @RobMcGregor35 they've still not addressed the tricky question of who is Scottish and gets to vote, mind.
@KimmiSixx yup, like those guys but Hartnell and Briere need a slap.
@KimmiSixx love those guys. My wife agrees #evennonhockeyfansknowphillyaretools
@KimmiSixx I know, that's why I'd like another team to knock them out so the Rangers get a nice easy run...
@KimmiSixx one less team to worry about in June :-)
@KimmiSixx oh absolutely, lack of consistency is frustrating. Canucks and Bruins can batter hell out of each other as far as i'm concerned!
@KimmiSixx could've sworn you were calling him all the names under the sun while I was checking twitter between periods last night...:)
@KimmiSixx his one on Sedin, while amusing, was also a bit cheap.
@KimmiSixx all against the rules, unfortunately! Salo didn't have the puck, even if he didn't mean to hit him.
@KimmiSixx Marchand should have, can't hit people in the knees! If Kesler had done it... ;)
@haveforkwilleat no bother!
@KimmiSixx 2-0 end of 2. Legue on the PP on a broken play. Sheffield looking decent but being outshot.
@CraigyIceHockey steelers lead 1-0 after 1.
@KimmiSixx fife have hardly any imports left! 1-0 steelers end of 1, Legue from Ramsay. Fife edge shot count 10-7.
@84arussell Damn, he got a beatdown there….
@kimmisixx ignore that, didn't read second tweet...
@KimmiSixx it's not on till tonight!
First workout of 2012 done, after recovering from the hammering my legs got running an ill advised 10k on new year's eve...
@84arussell haha. He was like that here till the coaching staff calmed him down a little...
@84arussell should do a great job. He'll be missed. And will soon come up against another former quality Fife import too...
@84arussell he won't be a first liner like here. But he's a big hitter and has a scoring touch.
@84arussell I know. The Austrians do it as well...still. Be interesting to see how he does.
@84arussell disapprove of the (common) mistake referring to the "English EIHL" though #lookatamap
@84arussell can't blame him much as the timing sucks. Weird fact, first time since I've watched hockey (16 years) that a Fife import walked.
Got to love @HLundqvist30 with the clutch save on Briere. @Rupper17 with two big goals and that salute, great win! #WinterClassic
@StutheBadger @84arussell if we made the semis without winning a game, and we lose today, does that mean we're in the final?
Fife up 4-1 against Sheffield end of 2nd. Not counting any chickens but with no Cohen or Stewart that's an awesome effort. Keep bringing it!
@KimmiSixx try the flyers game thread here. 
Love Gaborik's explanation of Torts' coaching - "There's nothing going around the bushes". Genius.
And I can't stand Philly, but that victory dance was #epic
Loved the first episode of Flyers Rangers 24/7. Anisimov is awesome
@DundeeStarsBlog ah, mis read that one. Though he's only 32...
@DundeeStarsBlog including the 22 year old McAlpine?
@craig_s96 lovely move by Kralj on the PP, but Fife not helping themselves with penalty trouble. Soft call for the PP though.
@DundeeStarsBlog fair enough then. Still think "wasted" is a bit harsh. Could say the same about Turner and Whitley if that was the case...
@DundeeStarsBlog bit harsh, no? Fife are bad but tonight isn't a fair representation of the team. No Zemlak, Stewart or Cohen.
@DundeeStarsBlog not at the game, but Stewart and Cohen being rested. You heard anything about the rumours saying Ceman is coming to Fife?
Game time! #psyched
@BoogieForth1 Scorpions - Rock you like a hurricane. Obvious, but had to be done.
I love this #HurricaneBawbag is a trending topic!
Love the new #flipboard iPhone app. Superb. But haven't worked out how to tweet from it yet.
@84arussell good decision! She's a keeper, that one.
@TSNBobMcKenzie Kovalev!
@RobMcGregor35 nope. But still, it was worth mentioning!
Why the hell are the BBC being so pro-government? Impartiality??
@84arussell good decision, right thing to do #solidaritybrother
@84arussell 22 multi millionaires in the cabinet. Yup, that's just "us being greedy"...
@84arussell thanks buddy! I've done the maths and it's frightening how much the reforms will cost me. And not a penny to the...
Hit the gym to take out some work relates aggression. It helped. #caseofthemondays
@TEAMJDPT rest today! Squats, press, pullups and power cleans yesterday #fitnessfriday
@misswiz still great news, well done!
@misswiz congratulations!! Good work. Permanent? Either way amazing given the Cooncil's recruitment practices...
@DundeeStarsBlog and original source lemon shower gel doesn't taste like lemon meringue pie, despite the smell #gutted
Just had the best nap.

The Garrett Zemlak show from two weeks ago - goaltending clinic!!
@craig_s96 that's hilarious. Totally down to luck that he stopped 74 pucks...and he didn't even "play any of the shots". Brilliant.
@craig_s96 he's pretty good. Aided by tons of ice time and two games where Fife failed to show up, mind.
Everyday I'm Byfuglien.
@joshuaradin Better city/crowd - Edinburgh or Glasgow?
@84arussell @dundeestarsblog I'd go with "Mike's a killer!" "Mike's a mess..."
@84arussell that would be awesome. I wish. That said, I'd settle for a stovie eating competition. I would own it.
@SlapshotScot good reports! One correction though - Zemlak is still injured so Daly played.
@misswiz "lo siento, no hablo inglés" ;)
@84arussell Courtesy of my school's German assistant. I may have #useditinalesson the other day.
@84arussell On another note, you might like this for some German humour 
@84arussell Gladly :) Though I don't particularly like the gym, I just like strength training and workout out but #donthaveasquatrackathome
The guy smoking outside my gym really doesn't #seethepoint. Neither does the guy reading the book while working out...
@84arussell yup, seems like a gutsy guy. Not sure how much choice he had in the matter but fair play nonetheless.
@84arussell as it should be. He'll get his, I'm sure (just like JB did, not that I ever like seeing guys get hurt). Eye for an eye...
@84arussell hehe, read those in reverse order!
@84arussell I think they'd argue that was dealt with with the 5 min major. If they can get out of disciplining for this stuff they will...
@84arussell sadly I think Shanny only deals with player safety, not moronic behaviour (like Wayne Simmonds).
However, I'm now setting up iOS 5 on my iPhone, and it's wicked.
Been on a media fast, and have hardly turned on a TV or electronic device except out of necessity for a couple of days. Felt good
@SlapshotScot thanks. Brutal from a Fife perspective. Going from a one goal game against Cardiff to that isn't good. Disheartening.
Food shopping, pregame meal then #gametime!
@MrDog23 i considered KSOs but they didn't have my size and I couldn't justify £110 for them! Hope the classics do fine,excited to try them!
@MrDog23 thanks! Just ordered a pair of classics, looking forward to trying them out!
@BornFitness vibram five fingers for weights/running/any other fitness activities , good idea? #BornQOTD
Ok, the commentators I can understand, but what the hell is that guy talking about? Barely speaking German...
Watching NYR vs ESV Zug.  The Schweizer Deutsch is a thing to behold, and I'm a German teacher.
@GarrettZemlak sorry to hear that, take it easy. We need you back soon!
@84arussell and now you mention it, I'm going to make a #brew
@84arussell should've taken his head off. Figuratively speaking of course.
@84arussell I'm reliably informed that we were thoroughly outplayed, but smacking a maskless goalie in the head is not cool. Somebody...
@84arussell haha, fair point. I think folk were upset about Zemlak so that was affecting their posts. I couldn't make it last night but...
@84arussell Physical is fine. Hospitalising a goaltender seems a bit unnecessary though. No penalty called, seems fair enough to complain!
New Blink 182 album downloading, and making me feel like I'm 14 again #rocknroll
@DundeeStarsBlog is the competition open to Fifers? I reckon I know a few of those!!
3 games in 3 nights and it sounds like the @fifeflyers battled hard. Great job.
@StutheBadger agreed on both counts. I think fife will add more players. Caps, I'm not so sure.
@StutheBadger and quite true, independent body is needed. Won't happen though...
@StutheBadger by the end of the season. I'm willing to give them that long anyway.
@StutheBadger true, but building slowly is the only option. May not be pretty but I'd be surprised if they've not made significant progress-
@StutheBadger and "other options" don't really exist for us.
@StutheBadger that I agree with. Salary floor and cap required. Won't happen with huge budget teams though.
@StutheBadger sustainability and stability need to come first.
@StutheBadger it will take time. That's the way things are, you can't buy a top class team overnight unless you're loaded, which we're not.
@StutheBadger not making excuses. We're not competitive just now. Will be though. Dundee took 15 games to get a win. Fife will develop but..
@StutheBadger unlike Sheffield/Cardiff. Did they not "Phoenix" last year? I'd rather not see my team go bust trying to do too much too soon.
@StutheBadger neither do I, but I'm realistic about the time needed to build a competitive team without spending more than we have
@StutheBadger fair enough, but doesn't it make sense to give them time to progress? Rather than expect a world beating team from day 1.
@StutheBadger worth keeping in the league though?
@StutheBadger 4 weeks into the season though. How were Dundee doing this time last year?
@StutheBadger also, how about Dundee last year? How many games did they get before being written off as "pointless"?
@StutheBadger surely the same for any league, no? Get rid of them both and hull/dundee games become pointless as they're the bottom 2...
@StutheBadger Pointless in what way?
@Gerry_Dewar it is brilliant. Had mine for 14ish months & it's great.  New version of iOS out in a couple of weeks too.
@Gerry_Dewar 4 is awesome, but new one supposed to be out in October...I'll have to look at twiducate, looks good!
@Gerry_Dewar Long time no see Gerhard, how's things? Are you actually using twitter in school? And the council let you??
@BenHeathcote thanks! Almost lack the energy to type this... #knackered
Deadlift record. #boom!
Day off work - workout, squats, bench, pull-ups and weighted planks #boom
@AndiSheach Room with showers? Jealous! If I still lived in Fife I'd be back like a shot!
I love a fresh pot of coffee
@DundeeStarsBlog Cheers buddy!
@84arussell It's a perfectly fine pastime :)
@StutheBadger Depends on where they're aiming. The target,I believe,is top Scottish team by end of year. Doable, but not with current roster
@84arussell All I said is give it time, not that they'd be beating top teams in the first few weeks….
Callahan as the Rangers' captain. Great choice. Heart and soul, and to quote Torts, "Balls the size of the building"
@84arussell Definitely true. At least that took some heat off Fife for getting humped...
@StutheBadger It was made clear to us though that if we're getting humped, they'll make changes. But they're starting with this for now…
@StutheBadger Cheers, that's a start I guess. We tied with them last week with no Cohen and Zemlak...
@StutheBadger it's a shame you had to watch an uncompetitive game but Fife will still be around next year, and they'll improve, as I said :)
@StutheBadger still less time than everyone else though. There will be additions but it's a different situation to the 9 other teams.
@StutheBadger my point was saying Todd's underestimated things is a bit harsh. Given the time and resources he has had, we'll improve.
@StutheBadger one more arriving this week, and they've said more can be had if results don't go our way.
@StutheBadger With Neil Black financing them. I think we'll struggle against big teams but we've still only got 5 imports.
@StutheBadger no illusions that the current roster is going to beat big teams, from fans or management.
@StutheBadger underestimated? Clearly haven't talked to him. He has a budget to work with though that isn't in the same league as many.
@AndiSheach nice piece in the programme last night Andi. How're the kilts getting on these days?
UK Hockey #ff @fifeflyers @DundeeStarsBlog @TCWfanzine @84arussell @Amateur_hockey
@FifeFlyers Me plus one newbie!
@FifeFlyers any news of the other two supposed signings?
@BenHeathcote I know, horrendous. Some great players, too, not that that matters. Tragic.
@DundeeStarsBlog I do, the editor asked me if that was ok. Now everyone will rub it in massively when they see how optimistic I am :-)
@BenHeathcote One of the worse musical instruments to have to teach kids in German. Ach ja, ich spiele Faggot...
@DundeeStarsBlog Been a while Mark! Love the blog, looking forward to the season. I'll come and say hello next time I'm at DIA.
@Fifeneebs appreciate the updates, can't make it till next weekend!
@BenHeathcote that explains the missus' baking this afternoon. I'll keep an eye out for flying meringue mixture.
@brian_stormont cheers, much appreciated!
@Fifeneebs cheers. It doesn't let me DM you unless you're following me by the way, sorry!
@brian_stormont @fifeneebs Any idea when the piece on Radio Scotland was on? Looking for it on iPlayer…cheers.
@misswiz yup, a mate of mine works there. Decent enough, but Fife's probably more convenient for you!
@misswiz it's the same everywhere. Congratulations all the same!
Found out I overpaid my student loan by about £400. Score!
@misswiz Congratulations!! Good work, where about? Permanent?
@GarrettZemlak congrats, you'll love it!  looking forward to seeing you play! Any idea when you arrive?
@84arussell cleared up on the thread on THF though, by a non-webmaster Flyers official.  PR will be updated.
@84arussell it's been corrected and people are still going crazy about it...
@84arussell to be fair, the point that he's a tryout for this weekend only seems to have been missed...
@84arussell …the BNL folded and I moved to Austria. Psyched to be back!
@84arussell Definitely. Even if we're getting humped (hopefully not) it'll be blast. Every Saturday since I was 10 I was there until...
@FifeFlyers When and where? FFP? Website? Twitter? Don't live in the Kingdom anymore so I need to know how :)
@84arussell To be fair, it's on the Flyers Facebook page. But fair point. A bit of modernisation needed...
@84arussell Ask and you shall receive - 
@84arussell too true. I have my reasons to believe this is true though, taken for what it's worth. Wait and see I guess!
@84arussell only just realised that was an import joke (thought it was an education joke!). They're all signed, I'm reliably informed...
@84arussell sadly I am in exile from the Kingdom...I live in Edinburgh. But fair point.
Sitting marking papers while my car gets its MOT done... #rocknroll
@MissMontyB thanks! School pretty busy here too but perhaps not quite as much as you! Not seen you in ages though!
@Jkonks71 Garrett Zemlak?
Why the hell am I still at work?!
Fife rumoured to be signing Garrett Zemlak. Young ECHL/AHL goalie last year, was at Kings training camp.
@84arussell nae chance of that happening! Hehe
@84arussell no worries :) sorry, long day and i missed the sarcasm! it'll be interesting either way!
@84arussell I know safety is great. Never seen anyone get hurt by the boards in fife in 15 years, so fair comment from Todd I think.
@84arussell 4 on 4? Sounds wicked, not seen much about it. That'll be awesome fun on a big ice pad!
@MissMontyB How's things, anyway?
@MissMontyB Hey! Not seen you in ages…I'm like you, not really sure what I use this for. Mostly hockey, but it's entertaining sometimes…
@84arussell haha, hope not! Life is sweet right now. Two weeks till hockey too!
@84arussell cheers dude, had a cracking time. Never been anywhere like it, lovely start to married life!
@BornFitness good call. I love deadlifts (not massively strong, max is about 130/140kg) but overheads are brutal.
@BornFitness what's your definition of "strong" for the average guy? Also, good way to easy hip flexor strains/tightness? #bornfitness
First week back at work done at lunchtime today!
The @fifeflyers sign Matt Cohen. Looks like a pretty good signing to me. Pleased with that one #eihl #fifeflyers
Not posted much in ages...been busy getting married and not working!
@martybiron43 "Head was down!!"
@studiomrmann Nasty. When it's dry it's normally great, and massive. I would've loved another skate on the big surface! See you tomorrow?
@studiomrmann How was the game in Kirkcaldy? Nice pic…
@TCWfanzine grand. I'll give it a bash and email you in a couple of days!
@TCWfanzine Sounds good, I'll give it a bash tomorrow. Where should I send it?
@TCWfanzine Flyers fan here, not much of a writer but I'm literate! What sort of thing are you looking for?
@84arussell it's all about how you interpret it. Much ado about not a lot I think. Like the sound of Stewart though, cheers!
@84arussell true, but that's not what you said. it's only just fan speculation, fife have said nothing. It's probably Danny Stewart anyway.
@84arussell not saying they will, but Fife  had NHL-experienced players plural the last few BNL seasons.
@84arussell cheers dude, really looking forward to it!
@LeonieLima disaster! Ah well, see you tomorrow :)
@LeonieLima Does that mean constant twitter updates of your progress? :)
@LeonieLima Happy birthday future cousin-in-law!
@84arussell True, but he's clearly completely unhinged given his recent performance.
@84arussell True, just going by what GMGM said.
@84arussell really? 
@84arussell His hardware counts for a lot. Backstrom's not won anything in the NHL yet, and disappeared in the playoffs IMO. Wait and see!
@84arussell 65 points last year is a bit of a regression though. Richards is proven and a winner. Will be interesting to see how he does!
@84arussell Good comeback though! Hehe.
@84arussell Backstrom has no Cups and no Conn Smythes :p
@84arussell possibly overpaid, but #betterthananycentreonthecapsroster :-)
Back from France, awesome fun. Had lots of French banter. And it's sunny in Scotland!
@FifeFlyers Yes! Can't wait for the first game :-)
@lauraubuggin I am indeed! Scary stuff, but I'm well excited! Thanks :-)
@LeonieLima I know the feeling! Enjoy the real world now :-) I'll say hello for you!
@84arussell thanks man. I'm pretty excited, sure it'll be awesome!
@84arussell a little bit! Doing what I can, but it is sort of flying by! 6 weeks holiday starting next Friday too!
@LeonieLima can't wait either!! Congratulations on the degree btw! All the best people get 2:1s :-)
...getting married in 3 weeks. Busy times!
Fife in the Elite League, road trip to Paris tomorrow, NHL draft yesterday and today, and free agency next friday. Not to mention...
@84arussell Come up one weekend anyway if you can! :D though stovies in Murrayfield are a poor imitation...
@84arussell ...quite an experience though. As is the whole rink singing "Geordie Munro" at the top of their voices.
@84arussell Not quite. There's a walkway, then the first row of seats is raised up about 10 feet. Right behind the benches is...
@84arussell ...of the players. Nothing quite like it. Not exactly safe, mind.
@84arussell Nah, plexi's fine. But it'll be strange for me having watched hockey there since I was 10 with no glass. You're almost on top...
@MissReneeLima I'm voluntarily working past the end of term for this one...!
Philly's GM seems to have woken up drunk and traded his top two centres.
@MissReneeLima With forty 14-year-olds... 
Should be fun though!
Syncing music to my iPod for Sunday's road trip to Paris. Hadn't given the new Foo Fighters album a proper listen yet, it's awesome.
@84arussell Hehe, I'd love to, but Tam Muir's not exactly short of cash. He'll be alright ;)
@84arussell Thanks! I grew up in that place, so psyched.Taught in a school in KDY for two years so might have to dodge some former pupils...
First Saturday of the season, hockey night! First time in far too long. Too psyched for words.
**** yes!!
If Fife join the Elite League tonight - proper live hockey for me in the old barn for the first time in a long time in September!
@TSNBobMcKenzie What about Europeans? Surely a McKenzie wouldn't mind posting a copy of his book to Scotland... ;)
@LeonieLima Why does that surprise you?? :)
Btw, are you guys back? What're you up to? Natalia hasn't texted me back!
@misswiz Fingers crossed! I'm sure there's something out there for you :-)
@misswiz Sorry to hear that. Same response I got last year.
@DukeLukemsEgo Uh-huh. So that's an average day for you then? You chop your balls off and die?
@DukeLukemsEgo TURN INTO A JET! BOMB THE RUSSIANS! CRASH INTO THE SUN! NOW I'M DEAD!!!
@DukeLukemsEgo SCORE SOME COKE! CRASH MY CAR! MEET A GIANT FISH...
@DukeLukemsEgo TALK TO CORPORATE! APPROVE MEMOS! MICROMANAGE!
@lauraubuggin Jealous. Goldfinger and anti flag too!
@84arussell Me neither actually. Seen bits and pieces but that's it. Only flaw with BOS is that Thomas either gets a shutout or gets lit up!
@84arussell I've got a nasty feeling the Canucks would take either of them. Still, should be a fun series!
@84arussell You think? I'd be torn who to support, not a big fan of either. I think the Sedins would have fun with Thomas... :)
@MissReneeLima haha, need to entertain myself!! Yup, brutal but fun!
@MissReneeLima amount of Facebook and twitter rambling I've been doing...?!
@MissReneeLima Weights circuits for me, knackering! She's back tomorrow night. Did you not notice the unusually high about of...
@84arussell *checks tv listings* so it would seem!
Work done, Spanish tests done, dinner done, evening gym session coming up!
@misswiz It took them longer last year. Muppets.
Travel immunisations later.I don't like needles, but I only really object to the really thick ones that I had in my neck last year...
Report writing. Awesome.
@MissReneeLima I'm going to claim I take satisfaction from a well pressed shirt.
Watching the Apprentice and ironing. It's like Wednesday nights at Uni again. And yes, I know how lame that makes me sound.
@mancphoenix Check out his duet with Eminem on YouTube ;)
@mancphoenix True that. There's inherent comedy in Raab as well...
@84arussell I've seen that, and the one with Will Smith. Einfach geil!
@84arussell Top comment on Youtube..."Raab macht aus Scheiße Gold". 
Wahr.
@84arussell Don't get me wrong, we share similarly awesome tastes in music. But I can't not like it, 'cause Raab = inherently funny!
Why the hell have I downloaded Stefan Raab singing "Satellite" from Eurovision? What's wrong with me?!
@andyleask That's about all the justification I need! Congrats again on the promotion :)
@andyleask Sweet! Good call. Congratulations, btw. Impressive stuff! I take it the iPad is as awesome as I think it is...
@andyleask So tempted to buy one, but with an iPhone and MacBook I'm not sure I can justify it...
Georgia for the win! #fb
@84arussell I love him. Was hoping for a verse of Wir Kiffen too...
Stefan Raab is awesome!
R.I.P Boogieman. Only 28, tragic.
New profile pic, me attempting to go #Halfclappertopcheddar
@DavidMiller_UK Cheers I love it! :) Never been hurt seriously (touch wood), and try to avoid showing up to work with visible bruises!
@DavidMiller_UK Hehe, thanks! Aye, there are a few, think you might be a bit higher profile than most! Love reading your stuff though!
@DavidMiller_UK cheers for the follow. Nice to see another fellow education professional on twitter, albeit a bit better known!
@BenHeathcote I know. Outrageous.
I'm not sure I like Twitter's suggested users. It suggested I follow the New Jersey Devils. I shall do no such thing.
I did just get sent a picture of a boat on the roof of my old work. It was shaped like a swan. Make of that what you will.
That's what I get for not posting in ages. Been too busy with work which I'm not supposed to talk about on this! But...
Decent day at work. Still hurt from the gym yesterday. Small mountain of chilli for dinner.
@BrandonPrust8 Great season this year, awesome effort and way to play through the pain! Welcome to twitter!
“@nategreen03: New Blog! How To Make the Perfect Cup of Coffee ---&gt; 
@84arussell Not even a hint at the shiny Cup rings they get to wear?
@84arussell Fair enough, just didn't find it massively funny. Seemed a bit jealous to me :p
@84arussell Genius? Mocking two guys for getting hurt counts as genius? Seems overly harsh to me. Like to see the Caps without 8 and 19.
@84arussell They're not the best but NESN are way worse! And then there's the Sabres guy...
@84arussell What's with the dislike of the Pens? I'm not a fan but at least they're not Philly or Boston...
@84arussell @theangrybudgie oh, that I agree on. Though the length of the contract suggests he plans to retire there. Could still move tho!
@84arussell @theangrybudgie ...possible I don't see him going anywhere. Not at the age he's at when he can still play.
@84arussell @theangrybudgie Doubt Tony would go to America. Didn't like it the first time, and while I agree with Anthony that anything is..
@84arussell Youngblood? "Head was down!"
@84arussell @theangrybudgie true. Both awesome tunes! Had the Meaning of Life on on the way to work this morning...
@84arussell Awesome album, love it!
@84arussell who do you fancy in the next round?
@84arussell a little, I was half asleep! NYR too young and without the offensive talent of WSH. On the right track for the future though.
@84arussell 3 months, exciting times! Exciting for the Caps too, congrats. We'll get you one day...
@84arussell nope, at a wedding I'm best man at! Got it on dvr...
@BenHeathcote no bother, just checking! I'm away up north for a wedding in a bit so reception may be dodgy...
@BenHeathcote think the iPhone one is a bit better but not sure! Btw did you get my text last night? Network was being strange!
@BenHeathcote It's not brilliant. Twitter app on iPhone is my preference, when it doesn't crash!
@84arussell With how much the Rangers PP bites it wouldn't have made much difference anyway!
@84arussell Only on my V+ box at home sadly. Lucky to escape penalty, but I know it's OT in the playoffs so the whistles go away.
@84arussell ...crosscheck from behind on Staal...?
@84arussell Just watching the part of OT that I missed yesterday. If Boyle's hit on Neuvirth was appalling, what about Backstrom's...
@84arussell Aaaahahahaha :)
@84arussell ...same with Backstrom. I'm not trying to be harsh, just trying to stop you getting prematurely excited ;)
@84arussell Possibly, but only if the Caps big guns show up. Ovechkin's got a couple of points but has been pretty quiet by his standards
@84arussell ...fortunate they were playing a team who fell apart.
@84arussell ...would murder them for that. Good team D with the lead, much less strong coming from behind. That's why I said they were...
@84arussell Sorry, I'm not convinced. With a lead, they're fine-fall behind they stop defending so hard. Vulnerable, a team like the Wings..
@84arussell Possibly true. The Caps will have a lot tougher challenges if they want to keep playing 'till June though!
@84arussell Haven't seen 'em, will take a look just now.
@84arussell ...let off the hook bigtime for some pretty awful play in their own end.
@84arussell Sure, but look at Det/Phx-that's a similar gap in talent level. I'm not surprised though, but I really think the Caps got...
@84arussell the caps played well, but the Rangers folded. I'm gutted but also don't think a 1/8 matchup should be so close...
@84arussell Never said luck, just they the rangers fell apart without that much pressure. Forwards stopped skating and D coughed the puck up
@84arussell anyway, be glad the Rangers just gifted you the series. Had the Caps by the throat then just fell apart. Terrible 3rd period.
@84arussell ...don't think he could've got out of the way. Second one was a bit cheeky though.
@84arussell Which one? 2nd one was unfortunate but on the 1st neuvirth stepped into his path at the side of the net. I genuinely...
@thenyrangers nearly 2am in Scotland and the sound of the Garden is filling my living room. Awesome!
@84arussell Sorry to hear that mate, fingers crossed everything turns out ok.
@TSNBobMcKenzie Hyacinth House,
The Doors, LA Woman ?
@84arussell Probably. You've got to hope so, as going back 2-2 will be a big test for their heads after last year.
@84arussell Rangers can only win games this series by out-working the Caps. They ain't doing it on talent!
@84arussell The better team is the Caps, but I don't think they were better today. Didn't finish a few chances, and got out-worked.
@84arussell ...those calls. Tough loss, Caps still in the driving seat though.
@84arussell True, penalties played a part in both games though. As I said, I only thought Hannan's was soft, the Rangers were working for...
@84arussell absolutely with the penalties. But the rangers worked for most of them. I felt it was the other way in game 2
@84arussell I don't know, got him above the shorts, below shoulder pads. I've been hit there and it hurts!
@84arussell Much like OV on Fedotenko in the 3rd. Went both ways.
@84arussell There was a soft one on Hannan, but that makes up for McDonagh's last game...I got back in time and caught up!
@84arussell Dinner at my future siblings in law. Should be back in time but got it taped just in case!
@84arussell I may have to watch the game on about a half hour delay tonight, grr! Will ignore twitter if I am!
@84arussell to be fair, aside from a big mouth he's more hated than he should be. Not dirty, doesn't hurt people. Just a total ****
@84arussell Stepan's wicked. Not the biggest or fastest, but has vision you can't teach.
@84arussell Fatigue and injuries I think. He broke a bone in his leg a month or two ago and hasn't been the same. Lot of guys like that!
@84arussell ...is stepping up yet. Hopefully the crowd get them into it tomorrow.
@84arussell honestly though, Dubinsky's been invisible and him and Callahan are normally a force. He's a big loss, and nobody else...
@84arussell I thought they carried the play but as you say, created nothing. Kept Caps offence quiet for 20 mins.
@84arussell ...own end, and Arnott. Rangers have worked hard but created nothing, Neuvirth's barely been tested!
@84arussell All in good fun though. Not got much to shout about to be honest, Rangers have been brutal! Impressed with Caps play in their...
That is a terrible powerplay.
That's why you can't let the Caps get any momentum. NYR better in period 1, big hill to climb now.
I freaking love Brandon Prust. Plays the game the way it should be played, heart and soul #wasNYR
@84arussell though by the book I think he took 3 strides...
@84arussell Didn't see a penalty myself, and whistles go away in the playoffs, for good and bad. Hit from behind, not a charge...
@84arussell Did I miss something?
@84arussell got ESPN on here, no idea which broadcast I'm gonna get!
@84arussell A diet of meatballs and Koppaberg is clearly the key!
@84arussell ...I'm not sure you'll blow him out. He's been in the zone for a couple of months now.
@84arussell True, but if they go in 1-1 it's even bigger. Not sure about "breaking" Henrik. If you do, we're screwed, but...
@84arussell Looks like he played a pretty good game despite that - Ovechkin held in check aside from the scramble he scored from.
@84arussell I'd lay more blame on the other 4 skaters for abandoning him on a long shift - had no options and a hard forecheck.
@84arussell I thought they'd come out hard, point to prove after last year. Still favourites by a mile, but game 2 is big.
@84arussell ..be a close series if the Rangers can pull out a result in game 2. Still, pressure/expectations on Caps.
@84arussell Only highlights - ESPN are showing 2&3 which I'll watch. BB's system worked but it came 6 minutes away from an ugly loss. Gonna
@misswiz Congratulations!!
@84arussell Seriously? I didn't realise. Did Varlamov not play last year?
@84arussell True, should be fun. Only reason question mark is goaltending. Still likely to win, but you never know...
@84arussell just stats. And sorry, but Staal over Carlson any day of the week. All-Star for a reason.
@84arussell Maybe 'cause of Henrik, but he's playing so get used to it! My opinion comes from watching most NYR games this year, not so much
@84arussell Close, but the Rangers are better defensively than you might think.
@84arussell Disagree, Staal's better. However, I meant team defence, not top 6. Similar GAA, block more shots, throw more hits.
@84arussell No answer to Ovy, Semin and co, but edge on defence and goaltending. Should be fun. I'm just psyched they're not on the tee!
@84arussell True but the Rangers won't be a pushover. Gritty and physical, won't make it easy!
@MissReneeLima it's awesome. Fast, exciting and fairly brutal!
@84arussell Rangers Capitals again...
@MissReneeLima a hockey team that won last night, meaning my team (@thenyrangers) made the playoffs. Which is a big deal!!
Yeeeaaaah!!!! Thank you Tampa Bay! #fb
@Evilmrnoface Ooh-eee-oooh...
I do hope you were going for the Weezer reference.
@LeonieLima Send us pictures!
@ahj here you go! 
@84arussell Danke schön!!
@NYDNRangers happy birthday Jesse, from a NYR fan in Scotland (who shares your birthday!)
@Kirsty_Henshaw just enjoyed my first bowl of Freedom, delicious and perfect as I'm a severe nut allergy sufferer!
@LeonieLima I'd just use that as an excuse to eat vast amounts of meat...
@barcatapas Muchas gracias! Did really well thanks :)
@dieselstrength Squats, BORs, Military press, pullups, dips. It was awesome
Nailed my Spanish exam, spent evening tasting food for our wedding. Good day.
Whoever designed the M8 is a...grr. Anyway, work stuff in Glasgow this morning, Spanish oral exam this afternoon!
@OfficialVernonK Love the workout tweets Vernon, you sound like you know how to work out properly! What're your goals?
Coffee. Spanish. Go.
@MissReneeLima Hehe, I wasn't referring to me this time actually :) I know, we just do a year's worth of work in 39 weeks!
@LeonieLima @missreneelima 9-6? Guess who left the house at 7 this morning and still isn't home...?
@misswiz Who the bloody hell advised you to do that?!
@BenHeathcote Not a massive fan,  but it'll do until the official app gets sorted!
Twitter app keeps crashing. Experimenting with Tweetdeck...
@Real_Dave_Watts He speaks better English than Ian Wright, to be fair.
@84arussell Can't wait. I keep managing to record Ranger blowout victories. Psyched.
Ryan Callahan is a beast. I love it. 7-0 #letsgorangers
@thenyrangers - love afternoon games, means that Ranger fans in the UK can watch them at a sensible time! Let's go Rangers!
@84arussell Hehe, fair enough!
@84arussell Can't win 'em all ;)
@84arussell last post should've read "I'm taping it for later" btw...
@84arussell I approve.
@84arussell Good, that's the way they can win games. I'm taking it for later. Young D but Staal is awesome and the rest are learning fast!
@84arussell Playing like they did Oct-Dec. Hard and fast. Injuries/fatigue over the last couple of months stopped them doing it consistently
7 year anniversary of the #nhlrangers trading Brian Leetch. I'm hoping that the 7 years of bad luck is over...
Had a conversation about tea with the girl serving us in a coffee shop earlier. She recommended Jasmin/orange green tea. It was excellent.
Washing my car, so she can return to her proper shade of bright yellow.
@Evilmrnoface You went last night? Awesome. Seen him twice before but couldn't go this time!
@84arussell Gotta be... ;)
@84arussell Hehe, must be! Strange that the Rangers best results this year have been against the Caps. They needed a big win though...
And I wake up to find the Rangers hammered the Capitals. Again. And I've got it recorded in HD when I get home! Good day so far!
Just took a large chunk out of a hotel buffet. Good start to the day!
Yes, this is an actual headline on the BBC news website 

@DukeLukemsEgo Muchas gracias señor.
@DukeLukemsEgo Cheers, yeah, all good here! Busy but definitely can't complain :)
@DukeLukemsEgo just checking! Opened twitter and it was all you, so to speak! How's life?
(don't stop btw, I enjoy amusing rants!)
@DukeLukemsEgo Are you hammered?
@Evilmrnoface Thought you'd like it!
@Evilmrnoface You still play the drums? listen to this when you get home... 
Watched Arsenal vs Barca despite not being a massive football fan. Great stuff. Got @OfficialVernonK 's American football programme on now..
@MissReneeLima Don't think she appreciates twitter... ;)
@MissReneeLima Absolutely ;)
Car's getting serviced. Battering down rain outside, but the garage vending machine tea is surprisingly nice.
Damn, speaking to actual Spanish people is tricky. I'm a languages teacher, dammit! I shouldn't be quite so nervous!
Spanish film screening tonight. And getting to pretend like I'm still a student.
@BenHeathcote Yes, yes it is!
@BenHeathcote Thanks to your recommendation, got some Jamie Cullum on while I do Spanish homework. Superb, cheers!
Enjoying some holiday relaxation. Got a Spanish book to read though...
Loving early hockey on ESPN. Rangers/Penguins, cup of tea, no work tomorrow!
@84arussell Love a good scrap though. So the aftermath of the goonery was hilarious.
@84arussell True. I'm no Pens fan, and don't mind them losing, but I don't like the gutless cheap stuff from the Isles. Unnecessary.
@84arussell Real cheap play by the Isles though...
@lauraubuggin Absolutely. I wanted to be a doctor ages ago, thanks to ER. Then Teachers came on Channel 4... :)
@misswiz Muy bien! Apprendo español tambien!
My morning of no work. So, Spanish reading and listening practice, coffee, then work and the gym later.
@lauraubuggin He does take some beating. I loved ER! Quite liked Benton as well...
@lauraubuggin Malucci? Really?!
@LeonieLima No idea! She doesn't seem like a big fan of it...
@LeonieLima Thankfully no! She read that, and days "whatever mate"... ;-)
@MissReneeLima Had a minor disagreement with a Glaswegian nutjob playing hockey last weekend...
@misswiz No bother. Do you have a date for your interview? Find someone who has it before you, the questions are exactly the same!
@misswiz Sure thing. I'll DM you my email address...
@misswiz And Fife interviews - sure thing. I did two (apparently quite good) ones, got plenty I can tell you! What would you like to know?
@misswiz Hockey last weekend, courtesy of some glasgwegian nutjob on the other team. Looked worse than it was though.
A rare quiet Saturday morning. Filter coffee, some tunes, doing as little as possible. Black eye has turned a pleasant shade of yellow too..
@Evilmrnoface Awesome
@BenHeathcote Nice. Just a simple korma-ish effort. Improvised mostly!
@Kirstie_Boyle lol, no worries. Couldn't find your username though!
Curry up!
Let's play Words With Friends. My username is 'Mike_Alexander'. 
@Kirstie_Boyle Words with friends? Game on...
@lauraubuggin Good point. Will see what other recommendations I can come up with...
Loving the blink-182 being played in @illegaljacks !! Dammit is a quality Friday night tune...
Think I might've just set a record for most hours without a cup of tea. Only cause I had coffee for breakfast though.
@lauraubuggin Any other Nick Hornby...?
@Evilmrnoface Good work!!
@Evilmrnoface Hell no. They've got a couple of decent tunes. And girl singers are always good.
@Evilmrnoface Yup! All good fun, cracking show it was!
@Evilmrnoface Awesome. Had about 4 albums on shuffle. Saw them with LTJ in Edinburgh a couple of months back. Brilliant!
Awesome gym soundtrack today provided by @Zebrahead. Rocked it.
@nicolalalalala VistaPrint , not too pricey and you can do almost anything with them!
New deadlift record, get in!!
@Evilmrnoface By the way, look who's joined Twitter... @ahrdennis
@Evilmrnoface Aah! If only I could say the same...alas I sort of have to learn Spanish for work. Good times....!
Spanish perfect tense this morning. He bebido un café. Hemos cantado. Han vivido. Has bebido un baso de agua...
Fantastico.
First day of proper work this year, bring it on!
@84arussell Should do, I think! I've got an app or two that work that way...
Killed it in the gym. Forgot how cold it was outside though, so leaving the house in a t-shirt and shorts wasn't so nice.
Gym time!
Twitter on the Mac App store...I like.
@misswiz Fantastic news too, congrats!
@misswiz Similar story here! Glad of the extra time off- getting married in July (!!) so plenty to do...!
@misswiz Nope! Not back till Monday, which is in-service. 4th year reports to write before then though... How's things?
@Support Hi, I'd like to use the username @mra , and apparently there is no account under that name. Won't let me use it though. Any help?
Username's too long, and the one I'd really like is taken (though apparently non-existant). Going to change myself to @mra6
Long time since I posted anything...snow, awesome Christmas holidays, catching up with folk, gym, chilling...that about covers it.
@MichaelDelZotto I'd love one!
