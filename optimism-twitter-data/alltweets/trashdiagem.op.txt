@bear_scream69 I can't even play minecraft for the mining, I just grow and collect stuff like a loser
@MAEpng did you mean, saved
Still thinking about skyrim... You can't gather stuff as well in DAI but I might try to just beat up a druffalo or seven if I can glitch it
@kurapika_ebooks same feel. I just really liked this idea
@kurapika_ebooks I love kaze
If I were an npc I'd be a farmer or gatherer of some sort. I just like collecting things and watching my dumb virtual stuff grow
@kurapika_ebooks I did for sure but it turned out ok anyway
@bear_scream69 I have like 100 hrs and they just go up so fast compared to my level because  I just wander around and collect things
@kurapika_ebooks hueo nah
I still haven't beaten skyrim, I got it right when it came out
I kinda wanna play my xbox but it's so cold down there in the basement... I want to wander around aimlessly on skyrim tho...

COOKIE HATES SANDALS???
cookie with his freaking hoodies and ugly tshirts and basketball shorts and ALFK:AALISFJS SA HES THE TYPE TO WEAR SOCKS AND SANDALS
@orenonawajack thats cause. he is cute.
my ocs are so unfashionable sometimes and it hurts... a lot of times they're just basic clothing types but then theres cookie...
ren wears soft sweaters and actual clothing thats in style, (thank god...)
@sseijou HIT ME

@kurapika_ebooks HELL YEA
@kurapika_ebooks @hisokasass i.

Ines likes my idea, :)c
@birbines Y E S
@kurapika_ebooks I don't know anymore, I tried to get someone to date Ren
@orenonawajack sorry
@tsoleille @sseijou I am the blurred party 
@orenonawajack no
@sseijou I will love them just the same,
@sseijou @tsoleille Maris tiny hands vs onco's yaoi hands, I crashed the party
@orenonawajack @kurapika_ebooks IM
@sseijou :Y
@platyhelminth blurred shigaraki 
@kurapika_ebooks I started a war while you were gone but Mari is the only one fighting,
@_shigaraki_ @orenonawajack SCRE
@kurapika_ebooks hi
@birbines aces
Arana and mami should be friends at least. I'll have mami and her two whole legs come to fight club or something
@orenonawajack I FUCKING LOVE OCS!!
@_shigaraki_ @orenonawajack JFC
@birbines ARANA AND MAMI SHOYLD DATE, BYE
@orenonawajack OCS!!
@_shigaraki_ @orenonawajack I can do it too 
@orenonawajack IM JUST
@orenonawajack @sseijou
@sseijou @orenonawajack ELA NO
@sseijou he has many notes he writes and sometimes he's checks his twitter like "oh yes this one thing happened"
@joorgley @orenonawajack <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@sseijou @orenonawajack SO IS BROWNI E
@joorgley XUSGXUSN
@sseijou EXACTLY. He's always drifting in a soup of information and d√©j√† vu though because he's like "did that one thing happen yet"
@joorgley SOMEBODY DATE MY FUCKING OC
@trashdiagem cause he's so used to fixing things LO
Redo tries so hard but sometimes he gets in low moods where he doesn't redo anything and he's like 'wow life without my quirk would suck'
@sseijou @orenonawajack redo is the one fighting brownie when he dies though
His first gf called his perfection creepy and he worked really hard for it so he's just like. "Well I fucked up but I don't understand why"
@joorgley hi
@orenonawajack ?? Brownie dies.
@sseijou AHZZJSKAHS
@trashdiagem ed anyone because he overthinks everything and thinks he's just gonna do it again
@trashdiagem everything, but she thought his perfection was kinda creepy? After a bit? So she broke it off with him and he hasn't really dat
It'd be funny if Ren was all suave with his first girlfriend and he was literally perfect because he never messed anything up cause he redid
@sseijou <SKULL>
@orenonawajack <SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>
Ren, Mami, Myunghun, and Bon are all... Singular...
@sseijou true. It's gonna be awesome
@SunnySheaCider :')
@sseijou you have brownie.. .
grumpy ocs? hello, i accidentally made all mine cheerful

i'm thinking mami is Ace, also. idk if that matters im just thinking
@tenfeis HUAPEH
@HappehCakes e _ e
woomph i hate(not really) clem why is he giving me feels
@HappehCakes YELLS THIS IS THE LESBIANS OVER AGAIN,
IM REDO-BLOCKING HIM ALREADY, WOW
that could also stop him from redo-ing certain things tbh
somebody date ren/redo
yells about the inevitability of the universe
simple answer as to why redo can't redo it, Sasami 'charms' him not to
How much do i want Redo to turn a blind eye, though?
@joorgley !!!!
SCREE c h
@joorgley i cant stop the sasami bad end even though he's got the quirk for it, because its fucking!! inevitable!1
@trashdiagem its too far back, too out of his range to be able to redo it
redo trying to stop the sasami bad end but ending up passing out from exhaustion because he can't Redo This
i created redo for nothing.
@MAEpng @Binaryandlove @gaysportsanime FUCK!! N-
@HappehCakes @kurapika_ebooks im fucking laughing
@Binaryandlove @gaysportsanime dont DO IT

@bear_scream69 "sorry, shroom baby"
@kurapika_ebooks @SirNoodleKnight hue. i cant let that happen though unless jason's and cookie are gonna fight 4 real tho HUEo anyway,,
Mami bad end: failed vendetta
@SirNoodleKnight @kurapika_ebooks jason kills poku, Mami gets Fucking Pissed (tm) fights jason. idk who would win it'd be pretty even

@HappehCakes //

@MAEpng

@SirNoodleKnight @kurapika_ebooks not allowed
@bear_scream69 Mami: *standing there with pancakes and confused* i thought you liked pancakes??
tegaki with me i'll either make you laugh or make you cry,
@bear_scream69 she will tho

Sleepy bear noises

Hm
Ryan the gays are a gaying
@bear_scream69 nice ;)
@bear_scream69 "do you want an opaque glass one or a clear one so you can freak people out?"
Kin, poku, soon cookie... The eyepatch squad
@trashdiagem I want cookie to fucking suffer though?? So
@bear_scream69 there's nothing to rescue but she'd make him a new eye
@bear_scream69 damn
All of the characters are like, losing their eyes and now I'm like :|c because maybe I should reconsider.
If I fall asleep the dogs will wake me with screeching barks and that's scary so
Zzz...!
Maybe sunmi can kinda tell how a person felt about an object too, when there's like lingering feelings in it
@kurapika_ebooks I know
@kurapika_ebooks cool <OK HAND SIGN>
Did ryss touch things with his eyeball? Probably not
@kurapika_ebooks yeah a little bit of both of them and then it keeps her out of hero work
@trashdiagem she has stuff that used to be her dads' so it means a lot to her
Sunmi's quirk could be like? You touch an object and you know the past of it, you knows who's it is, what it is. That's harmless and cute
Oh wait maybe
Sunmi might have a combination of precognition but it takes touching? Maybe she can see thoughts if she touches you? Idk that sounds kinda
@kurapika_ebooks hm
@bear_scream69 is poku's eye wrecked after this?
@HappehCakes <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@bear_scream69 mami busts the door down
@kurapika_ebooks sunmi? Or
@kurapika_ebooks I am the very tired

(Cool-motive-still-murder.gif)
@kurapika_ebooks yeah
Sighs today isn't very busy but it's busy enough! Customers are nice today -w-
I don't want feelings about brownie wtf
@bear_scream69 TEARS
@sseijou I don't wanna think about him like that though he's too EUGH
Brownie is 4ever alone and just wants somebody to say the Nyah with him
@sseijou thank u
@sseijou "I just wanted someone to say it back, haha. Ok do it." WHEEZES COUGHS BLOOD "nYAH"
@sseijou redo already tried, and tries. But nothing ever works and redo ends up dodging and BANG
@sseijou and then he dies
Wheezes and coughs blood "...Nyah"
@sseijou no I'm gonna kill brownie
