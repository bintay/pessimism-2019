@TheistAmNot Thanks. It's probably just a dream. It seems pretty distant sometimes.
@KatePecina @MayfieldJoy I so sorry for your loss. It's very hard, and he was beautiful.
@cheyenn10316666 That's good. I wouldn't want to end up being dinner. :-/
Actually, I have been around a few of them. They're nice.
@cheyenn10316666 Excellent point. Uh, how friendly are these guys (you feed them well, right?). <GRIMACING FACE>
@cheyenn10316666 Yes, even if it's just us..... and 10 tarantulas. ;-)
@cheyenn10316666 I think that's very cool. You're not weird (or we both are). :-)
@jimdigs Exactly, until they're confronted by the violence and hate in the OT. Then they scream "metaphor". They're hopeless.
@jimdigs Right. They wear Christianity on their sleeve, yet behave like machines without a sliver of compassion. Hateful, cheap people.
@jimdigs @GodFreeWorld That's probably what they have in mind next. But once a kid is born, they become drains on the state. Unwanted.
@jimdigs @GodFreeWorld LOL. Really? That human.
@Mwforhr @EveVolved @JoeSmithForReel @mikejmartin I completely agree. They like to play the switch burden of proof game. That's very lame.
@Mwforhr @EveVolved @JoeSmithForReel @mikejmartin @neiltyson A lack of belief follows from science. So, you're right. Just let science lead.
@Mwforhr @EveVolved @JoeSmithForReel @mikejmartin @neiltyson That's where atheists can help. Keep science and facts in view.
@Mwforhr @EveVolved @JoeSmithForReel @mikejmartin @neiltyson Yes, that's why we need to keep defending education from the RWNJ madness.
@JoeSmithForReel @Mwforhr @mikejmartin @EveVolved @neiltyson There does seem to be a resurrection of anti-science. It's troubling.
@EveVolved @MDoveton @Mwforhr @neiltyson I think he's making good progress by just being himself and being true to science. He's respected.
@MDoveton @Mwforhr @EveVolved @neiltyson Very good point. We'll have made real progress when neither of those things matter.
@EveVolved @Mwforhr @neiltyson Unfortunately, it's beneath him. He can do more good by promoting science in our culture. Still I can dream.
@EveVolved @Mwforhr That's so true, and our biggest problem. The RW hate does one thing rationality doesn't; promotes passion. We need that.
@Mwforhr @EveVolved @neiltyson I sure wish Neil would run for office. Can you imagine him leading the Science and Technology committee?
@EveVolved @Mwforhr You have to get the word out that we're not going to take this anymore!
@EveVolved @Mwforhr Good for you. I admire your effort in what must be a frustrating environment.
@Mwforhr @EveVolved Exactly, and CA is usually leading the way. Dana's days may be numbered.
@Mwforhr That's for sure. My only fear is that we won't get good candidates running. He's one but I'm hoping there are others also.
@EveVolved @Mwforhr Of course, I see ridiculous comments by him on the twitter often. I'm sad for you.
@EveVolved @Mwforhr That's all any can do. Just don't give up, the world is moving our direction, overall (though hard to see sometimes).
@Mwforhr I'm hoping Grayson will run for Senate which the Rubes gives it up for his impending glory. (NOT)
@EveVolved @Mwforhr Wow, now that's really bad. I wish I knew exactly which one you were talking about, but there's so many up there now.
@Mwforhr @RepWebster That's very frustrating. Those two nefarious groups work together a lot. Terrible. Hope you can vote him out.
@Mwforhr That's bad. I actually live in a blue area, with all the Universities here, there's actually some smart people. Our rep is a Dem.
@Mwforhr No, I'm not on Facebook, but I'll go look for it on Google.

@DelGirlsHoops @atheistarts Looks like revisionist history to me. You have to cherry pick the bible too much. But, I'm agnostic atheist.
@DelGirlsHoops @atheistarts I suppose. If you accept there's no scientific evidence for deity/afterlife, and much evidence that refutes it.

@SladeSuiter @truthglow I'm so sorry for your loss. It's hard, I know. I just lost my boy, Angus (my avi). You'll never forget him.
@dremmelqueen He'll need a good boss. They're still feeling each other out, but they had a bout of bitey-face yesterday. That's good.
@dremmelqueen We think he'll swim bc his "sister" (Flattie) loves it. His breeder is a vet and she influenced the pick for our active home.
@dremmelqueen Yes, and at 9 weeks, we can't tell what he'll be like. His having fun is no. 1 priority. We'll give him chances to try things.
@dremmelqueen It sure will. It will depend on if he'll swim. His current goal is couch potato, but we'll expose him to lots of fun things.
@Petapup1 You're very lucky! :-)
@dremmelqueen if he likes them. He'll have a very good life, and will steal our pillows at night.
@dremmelqueen I'm so sorry to hear about Cassie. It's really hard. No, Benny isn't a rescue. We'll show him some, and do performance events,
@dremmelqueen His name is Benny.  We got him last weekend. Just trying to move on from Angus's passing. Rebuilding the pack!

@LilyFromEden @Cynicalreality Yes. Unfortunately, too few people with the means to help are sufficiently self-motivated. Most want the PR.
@Cynicalreality @LilyFromEden I have much more respect for the truly anonymous act. The good feeling inside is deserved in that case.
@LilyFromEden @Cynicalreality Exactly. It's also why my eyes roll when I hear people brag about their altruism.
@LilyFromEden @Cynicalreality Absolutely true.  It's a basic law of behavior that too few know. No behavior goes unreinforced.

@reasonandlogic Yes. I think we're finally going to see something (?) different. More confrontational. And lots of vetoes.
@reasonandlogic I see your point. I was focused on Repugs complete unwillingness to negotiate solutions, lest Obama accomplish something.
@reasonandlogic Are we still talking about Obama? I would say those attributes apply more readily to Boehner and McConnell, except the last.
@reasonandlogic Yup. Their only agenda is Obama's failure. He didn't seem to want to acknowledge that. Maybe he's right not to, idk.
@reasonandlogic I know, but it would have made us look more responsible to the rest of the world. You're right that he had to stay above it.
@reasonandlogic The movie was a good presentation of the deep corruption. They should be under the jail. I wish Obama had prosecuted them.
@reasonandlogic Good point. But the movie got me even more pissed off at them.
