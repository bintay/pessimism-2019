Un missile di Missiroli!
Zaza finally breaks his duck! Last time he scored was February 1st vs Inter!
ZAZAAA!!!
(via @ScotM87)
Brienza or Lionel Messi!!! 
If Atalanta win, (currently winning 0-2) they'll send Cesena to Serie B despite whatever result Cesena get.
Palermo are down 0-2 after 16 minutes...
@juveennio Hopefully in this case their judgment is better than a lot of Juventini
Dybala not starting for Palermo a sign he's on the verge of being sold.
@juveennio I don't think it's a problem with not wanting to spend the money, more of a problem of who we're spending it on..
Lazio play Inter at home &amp; Napoli play Parma at the Tardini.
Really important games for Lazio &amp; Napoli today. Lazio has the chance to pass Roma &amp; go in second while Napoli can go two points from third.
Tests today ruled out a serious injury for Toni Kroos, therefore it is very likely he will play vs Juve on Wednesday. #JuveNews
@DavidAmoyal He didn't sound as happy as he said he was about Juve beating Real &amp; hoping they go to the finals hahaha
Kroos had to be subbed off due to injury in Real Madrid's 2-2 draw vs Valencia today. Ancelotti ruled out a muscle problem.
#JuveCagliari #jvtblive @juventibus 
He's back. @realmadrid 
Quando sei forte, sei forte e basta #Pogba
Marseille's third kit for 2015/2016 season is beautiful- 
Acc. to Sportmediaset, Atletico Madrid have halted on signing Cavani which puts Juve back in the race- contract until 2019 or 2020 #JuveNews
@WalksWithLenny Seriously? Hahah I take it back then <GRIMACING FACE>
Firmino, Çalhanoglu &amp; De Bruyne are three players I'd love Juve to look into signing. All could prosper into world class players at Juve.
What a coincidence, Franco Baresi &amp; Andrea Barzagli are born on the same day.
Happy Birthday @andreabarzagli2 !!!
#Cavani: "Giocherò ancora al Psg? Non  so cosa potrà accadere." #Juventus
Juve's next games:

Juve-Cagliari
Real-Juve
Inter-Juve
Juve-Napoli
Verona-Juve
Juve-Lazio (Coppa Italia Final)
Possible CL final
Juventus will be celebrating their Scudetto after Juventus-Napoli on May 23rd. That will be their final home of the season. #JuveNews
Paul Pogba has returned to training today!!!! #JuveNews
If everything goes well with Pogba's recovery process, he'll be able to return playing vs Cagliari (off the bench) &amp; might start vs Real.
so players won't miss the final due to yellow card accumulation.
Thank God Uefa changed the suspension rule in the CL. From now on yellow cards reset in the finals,
If you look closely, you can see Boateng's shooter 
If there's any team to come back 3-0 at home to Barcelona, it's Bayern. Tie is still not over but high chance Barça go through.
Boateng got shot
This guy can't be fucking serious- what did I just witness
This guy can't be serious
@ilGoNearPost For sure. I can only see them more vulnerable on the counter in the second leg as they'll be constantly attacking.
@DezilDez @fabiobarto @AliquaScripto There you go
@paologucc @BianchiniR8 Fellaini!!?? Ma sei fuori? Le altre tre sono molto diverse a Paul.
Prima Pagina #CdS 
@ilGoNearPost Very true. I'd play a 4-3-1-2 &amp; take advantage of the space between their CMs &amp; CBs. Surely Ramos won't be playing CM.
@fabiobarto @DezilDez @AliquaScripto Old school mentality believe it or not. In the modern game a lot of managers value att. fullbacks more.
@fabiobarto You insulting Licht?
JUVE NO LIMITS, Prima Pagina #GdS 
Prima Pagina #Tuttosport 
@AlexStanek @Mike04FC Chiellini was sooooo bad again tonight ehh buddy .. I'm sure you would know
He helped the belief between the players grow instead of finding ways to say why we are a step behind.
.. as to why we aren't good enough &amp; why we can't compete with top clubs while Allegri knew the strength in our team.
The difference I noticed about this years Juve in the CL &amp; Conte's Juve in the CL is the mental aspect. Conte was usually looking excuses ..
@ilGoNearPost Yes!! Now I'm trying to understand if it would be better going into the second leg with a 3-5-2 or 4-3-1-2...

@ChampionsLeague #JUVRMA #UCL #FinoAllaFi…
"Juve will suffer playing against the big teams since there's no competition in Serie A"
Forza Juve. I love JU.
#33 
@Being_Max @SnoopianH @Marcocalcio22 2-0 for me as well. Sturaro will provide more defensive support &amp; more aggression/combative spirit.
10 minutes. #JuveReal
Quasi lì. #JuveReal
Vidal will provide incredible energy in the defensive third &amp; attacking third.
WISH WISH WISH I was the Juventus Stadium to watch Juve-Real
Sto TREMANDOOOO
He would have been key on the counter but Allegri has opted other wise.
Pereyra not playing !!??
@ilGoNearPost Vidal/Marchisio/Pereyra will be key in that aspect. I'm expecting Pereyra to exploit the space Marcelo leaves while attacking.
@AlexStanek @Mike04FC Stop basing your opinion on a couple of the CL games where he hasn't been good b/c I know it's coming from solely that
Didn't know our home record was that good against Real. #PRT
@Mike04FC Love your avi buddy
@AlexStanek @Mike04FC Probably coming from someone who's never watched him
@ilGoNearPost I'm feeling confident.. We'll either win by a one goal margin or tie
Last year Chiellini got wrongly sent off in the first group stage game vs Real. Hopefully nothing like that effects us today. #JuveReal
Wow, I can't believe we're playing the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals today. Crazy.
Verratti would be a top replacement for Xavi. Very similar players.
As it stands, Morata is in favour to start over Llorente vs Real Madrid. #JuveNews #JuveReal
La classifica degli ultimi 4 anni di @SerieA_TIM: numeri importanti per la @juventusfc. 
Be careful what you say about Inzaghi, not to long ago people were saying similar things to Allegri... Now look where he is.
@MirkoVucinic Grande Mirko!!
Dispiace per Inzaghi, questo messaggio non è solo per lui ma per tutti, non smetti di lottare quando le cose non va. Devi credere, sempre.
And for the fourth year in a row, I wake up with the feeling we are the Champions of Italy. Amazing.
@zlatan18milan @agiamba 

EPIC TWEET 
From two years of crying to four years of winning the Scudetto. I will always be by your side, @juventusfc.
Been waiting to post this since the day he said it 
SCUDETTO SCUDETTO SCUDETTO SCUDETTOOOOOOO
Incredible. As soon as this season started I was the least optimistic but at the end I'm the most happy. I love this club &amp; forever will.
WE ARE OFFICIALLY THE CHAMPIONS OF ITALY FOR THE FOURTH YEAR IN A ROW! I LOVE JU!

Tevez scored his first goal in Serie A against Sampdoria at the Marassi.

You know what, now that I think of it I'm happy we brought back Sturaro. I thought he wouldn't have been of use but I was wrong.
Marotta: " ... non ci saranno festeggiamenti in caso ottenessimo un risultato positivo."

Marotta: "Sicuramente torneremo a Torino, dopo il fischio finale di stasera si penserà alla partita di martedì,un altro appuntamento storico
In caso di vittoria tornerete a Torino per festeggiare o per riposare in vista del Real Madrid?
Here we go.. 5 minutes before we watch a decisive, decisive game in our quest for our FOURTH CONSECUTIVE Scudetto.
Marotta: "Conoscete bene Ferrero, è un uomo di spettacolo quindi fa ridere."
Players like Vidal, Marchisio, Tevez are all players who can play on the weekend &amp; then in mid-week at 100%.
We are playing against Sampdoria at home, a team who can certainly cause us trouble.
The likes of Evra, Chiellini &amp; Pirlo who will rest today, will all play on Tuesday.
Allegri has rested those who are aren't capable to give 100% if they play today &amp; on Tuesday.
Altidore: "When we’re on the ball, we just kind of move and try to make something happen. He’s a natural at that."

@zlatan18milan @agiamba Please, enlighten me
I completely agree with @DavidAmoyal. You can't criticize Galliani on poo transfers when he has had no money to work with.

better facilities for the youth teams, giving his daughter the opportunity to go to school in Italy &amp; assisted trips to England.
ADL guaranteed him three marquee signings (a defender, a midfielder &amp; right winger/bring Reina back), new developments to the San Paolo,
De Laurentiis is very adamant on keeping Benitez at Napoli, offering him a ton of things to get him to stay.
In these hours Milan is solely focusing on selling the club &amp; finalizing the deal with Mr. Bee.

#Parolo, one of the best signings of the summer (in Serie A), scored again today. Has had a great season at #Lazio.
Part of the reason Lazio has had so much success this year is due to all of their "risks" working out, i.e Pioli, Parolo, De Vrij, etc.

@KhalidAli_K Yeah he's a dangerous player
However Salah's playing &amp; last time he played at the Juventus Stadium he scored a double. #JuveFiorentina #PT
Not the strongest Fiorentina side we've played recently. Missing Pasqual, Borja Valero + I don't really fancy Mario Gomez.
vs Fiorentina #Vamoooosss 
PSGs President strongly stated that he won't sell Cavani in the summer as he still rates him highly. He said he wouldn't even sell for €50M.
Juve probable XI: (4-3-1-2) Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Barzagli, Chiellini, Evra; Sturaro, Pirlo, Marchisio; Pereyra; Llorente, Tevez #JuveNews
@ilGoNearPost They were a good combo those two. Kondogbia is starting to really find his feet at Monaco now.
Basta parlare del futuro di Tevez, mi ha rotto le palle
Decided to not get anyone from Inter. Not convinced they'll do to well even though I do feel they're gonna win.
Decided to get him. Should I get anyone from Inter? #fantacalcio
Deciding whether to put Di Natale in my #fantacalcio team for this week. Udinese play Inter at home &amp; Di Natale is sure to start. Yes or no?
@ilGoNearPost Same.. When he went to Monaco he kind of lost his touch a bit .. Starting to regain continuity now though.
@ilGoNearPost Exactly how I perceived him; has more of a defensive nature than Pogba &amp; less gifted going forward
Al-Khelaifi: "Sì, ho incontrato Paul Pogba. È un grande talento, è francese e parigino. Ma tutti i grandi club lo vogliono." #Juventus
@ilGoNearPost They were calling him Monaco's Pogba

Bournemouth beat Bolton 3-0 to secure a place into the Premier League next season.
Maldini, Pirlo, Ambrosini, Oddo, Gattuso 
Police have confirmed that the bomb was indeed thrown by Juventus fans from their section of the stadium towards the Torino supporters.
He also mentioned that he will be able to play alongside a fellow Argentinean, Mauro Icardi in attack.
Mancini called Dybala today to explain his intentions of wanting to bring him to Inter &amp; his project for next year.
A victory for Bournemouth will see them promoted to the Premier League. 
Denis has been suspended for 5 games after his episode with Tonelli yesterday in Empoli's change room. #SerieA
Sabatini is also interested in Domenico Berardi but that is a much more complicated scenario as he is also owned by Juventus.
Sabatini was at the Bentegodi yesterday to attend Verona-Sassuolo. In particular he was there to watch Verona midfielder Jacopo Sala.
One of the people I saw disrespecting Juve's bus was a father SPITTING on the bus with his son right beside him.. And then people wonder..
I don't know, it might not make sense to you but it's hard to explain.
To me, (apart from what happened in Torino-Juve) I don't mind when these sort of things happen because they make the "game" more intense.
@Neymarred Same people who write off Serie A.. These are the people who judge without a real sense of what they're judging
Perotti scored a very Hazard-esque penalty today; slow run up, wait for the keeper to move, then shoot on the opposite side.
I had a big feeling we wouldn't win &amp; an even bigger feeling Quags would score. Not really bothered by this loss, we have achieved A LOT.
Never thought I'd ever see this but it has actually came to that point. Crazy. 
Gran gol di Hernanes
Marco Motta's team Watford have been promoted to the Premier League. Somehow I find the first two words to this tweet funny...
Kolarov, Cleverley &amp; Carlos Sanchez all scored their first goals of the season in Manchester City-Aston Villa.
@KalininDevin I'm sure he'll renew
Like Grealish a lot; quick, good dribbler, good close control, can make things happen.
Excited to see Grealish, Benteke &amp; Delph.
City - Villa for me!
money that is required for these players and I don't they'll be available in the summer.
How much money do Inter actually have to spend this summer? A lot of talk about top players coming but Thohir has never brought in the ..
@DezilDez Tevez will be our main player for that, dropping in the pocket between their midfield &amp; defence to try &amp; cause problems
@DezilDez will be key for us in transition &amp; he's much more efficient in a 4312
@DezilDez I don't really.. 433 all the more likely. Question is what formation WE'RE going to play.. 4312 much better on counter + Pereyra
@DezilDez Yeah, Modric is out for Juve tie. Ancelotti has improved them this way that's for sure. I dont know if they'll play a 442 though
@DezilDez True, T.Motta &amp; Verratti out in 1st leg the main reason why they didn't have as much control as they should have had
@DezilDez Of course- they all hold different, interesting match ups against Juve so hopefully we'll see another after Juve-RM
@DezilDez Then we wouldn't create as much b/c we'd be sitting so deep.. Plus if we go the counter att. route, 3-5-2 isn't the best for that
@DezilDez will be they're main focus which will take something away from their attack
@DezilDez But they don't play with a pure DM (Don't think Ramos will play in midfield) which'll help our cause but hopefully organization..
@DezilDez In CL recently they've been up to par imo. Truly dominated PSG both games (rule out 2nd half of 2nd leg)
@DezilDez All very good points but I'm sure Pep would adapt to this using as much width as possible, overlaps, etc
@DezilDez We'll be counter attacking vs Real as well. They like to keep possession in the oppositions half which invites the counter
@DezilDez You think? Juve have shown to struggle playing it out of the back when opposing team is pressing high up the pitch (key for Barca)
@DezilDez I see what you're saying but we aren't exceptional on the counter &amp; Bayern would have simply dominated the game
@DezilDez Yes!!! But I feel that Barca's front three would have made the difference, they're in ridiculous form atm
@DezilDez It's punch for punch really. Simeone (&amp; co.) like to give &amp; RM like to give it back
@DezilDez I don't mind the "irritating players" tactic b/c that's just his style but you can't do something like that, poor move really
@DezilDez I know! But does Ramos know how good Gimenez will become? Could definitely become better than he is,then he'll have the last laugh
Blanc: "La Juventus su Cavani? È normale che su di lui ci siano dei club interessati, sarei stupito del contrario."

Now that Juve has built an established team &amp; staff (proved in last 4 years) we can challenge year in year out for the Champions League.
See, Guardiola practically started a new era of football by winning playing beautifully but that was the only way he knew.
Now, if you can do both consistently then I applaud it but if you're not for risking it then I also value your decision.
is very important but the result is much more.
At times, you can't always play beautiful football. The important thing is first the result, then the performance. Of course performance
I completely agree with Allegri in this sense. Would you rather be out of the CL having played a good second leg or the opposite?
sometimes if what it takes to get the result is playing poorly you need to accept it and understand.
that the 3-5-2 is too defensive, etc. In response to this Allegri referred to the result being more important than the performance and
If you watched Allegri's interviews yesterday after the game he looked visibly annoyed when you would mention how Juve played poor,
@ilGoNearPost Exactly, Pep would be perfect. My concern is he doesn't really have that defensive nature Simeone's system/game asks for
Qatar based club Al Jaish has offered Pirlo a €7M-€8M/year contract, however it looks like Pirlo will decline it. (via @DiMarzio) #JuveNews

Allegri: 
FINALLY FINALLY IN THE SEMI-FINALS OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE! OH I CAN'T BELIEVE! TOP FOUR!!!!
@ilGoNearPost Oh yes! I forgot Atleti.. Chelsea will be there next year I reckon.
I don't remember the last time Juve had this little of the ball. Luckily Monaco aren't the best in attack.
@ilGoNearPost I don't know.. I feel Juve, PSG &amp; Chelsea are all up there
12 years since we've been in the Semi-Finals of the Champions League. TWELVE. So good to be back. I LOVE JU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fourth best team in the world behind Bayern, Barca, Real?
SEMI-FINALS!!!!!!! 
SIAMO NEI SEMI FINALI!!!!!!!!!
Only thing is Llorente would offer very little on the counter.
Llorente needs to come on for Morata to provide more of a option as a target man. From there we need to play off him &amp; attack.
Berbatov coming on for Monaco. #MonacoJuve
@charlesgambino Not really. Kinda suffering from Monaco's high pressure in our half.

I much rather have Marchisio play at LCM than Vidal. Vidal's more comfortable on the right side I feel.
BRIVIDI! DAI JUVE!!!!

Juventus have offered €18M to Zenit for Axel Witsel. Zenit's asking price is €30m however. #JuveNews (via @DiMarzio)
#Vidal trained today and will be fit enough to play Monaco! #JuveNews
I told you!!!! Yesssss!!!!! 
@ADP1113 So it's between Mr. Bee &amp; Richard Lee. Thailand vs China. 60% of Milan vs 75% of Milan. Both seem key on Maldini though.
I have a feeling Vidal will be ready for Monaco. No way can we be this unlucky to lose one of our most in-form players atm in a crucial tie.

TWO MORE DAYS #MonacoJuve #UCL 
Romulo will be at Allegri's disposal post-Monaco. Juve have a €6M option to buy him from Verona when his loan expires. #JuveNews

Imagine being 18 years old and starting your first professional game in the Derby Della Madonnina. #Gnoukouri
Then after some poor performances/results they were a completely different team.
Then ever since they haven't been the same. 

It's a great explanation because look at how they started the season, all gun ho.
Ever since Garcia started to lose that belief a bit (due to poor performances, BIG loss to Bayern, etc) it transmitted to his players.

Per quelle cifre #Dybala sta bene con Zamparini.
Garcia created this Roma based on a great system and sheer belief that they're a great side who can challenge for the title.
I think Roma's downfall is due to the fact they lost belief in themselves and their ability as a team.
Is Anita playing LB !!!????

@TikiTakaStyle I think it's b/c he feels theirs no one else &amp; now that they're winning he might as well keep it..
@TikiTakaStyle Yeah but I don't think Cazorla should be given that job. He shouldn't be used from deep, can't give his all there.
@TikiTakaStyle That's why there needs to be a balance; one who does the defensive work and one who conducts play
@SpazioJuve Uno dei gol che non dimenticherò MAI! Emozioni incredibili.
Compliments to Griezmann who managed to keep his goal scoring record even at Atleti; a main faucet of his game.
This is some really great insight on how managers of top clubs get their messages across to their players - 
You can tell Vidal has returned to his old self. Just look at his smile when he came off.
Another victory, another clean sheet, another important pass towards the Scudetto, another great performance. Simply brilliant. I LOVE JU!
Pirlo <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Big mistake by Pioli leaving Candreva on the bench. Look at the impact he's had already after coming on at half time.
SAN FUCKING GIGI
Vidal: il migliore ricuperatore di palla NEL MONDO !
Marchisio: "Dovevamo fare così, cinici davanti ed attenti dietro, perché loro sono in un buon momento e hanno giocatori di qualità davanti."

Dopo 10 secondi gol di Tévez

#jvtblive
But now it's time for them to be taught a lesson.
I'm actually glad to see Lazio doing this well since I predicted it at the start of the season. The signs were there really.
Don't know why Van Gaal took off Shaw to put Blackett. Really killer their chances to tie the game up. Not to mention, he didn't sub on RvP.
Can't believe Pioli has benched Candreva.
Hazard's cut back was so good even Drogba fell.
@LukeRomeo Yeah which is why I'd classify him as a B2B b/c he can do both. However I'd prefer him as a pure defensive midfielder.
Good substitutions for Van Gaal but now RvP needs to come on.
@fabiobarto He doesn't really opt for it too often though
Instead Ramires comes on. Good substitution but I still would have backed Cuadrado.
Would you classify #Matic as a pure defensive midfielder or a box-to-box?
Van Persie needs to come on for Man U. At this moment he could have a very big impact I feel.
Cuadrado should come on for Oscar. Will offer more pace &amp; more of a threat on the counter &amp; he'll still do a a good defensive job.
I feel like the game is starting to pick up now. #CHEMUN
#Hazard is without a doubt one of the best dribblers in the world.
Juventus probable XI: (3-5-2) Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Padoin, Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio, Evra; Matri, Tevez #JuveLazio
Incredible efficiency by Chelsea. That's Mourinho for you. #CHEMUN
If you didn't already know Juve will have 'EXPO Milano 2015' as their sponsor for their next 3 league games #JuveNews 
@EmilioCelini Don't worry I'm feeling confident! We always prevail at the JStadium!

I can't see Pioli benching Candreva. One of their top players and can have a serious positive impact for them. #PT
Lazio probable Xl acc. to GdS: (4-3-3) Marchetti; Basta, Cana, Mauricio, Braafheid; Lulic, Biglia, Cataldi; Mauri, Klose, Felipe Anderson
#Lazio's last 5 Serie A games:

Lazio 4-0 Fiorentina
Torino 0-2 Lazio

#Juventus' last 5 Serie A games:

Juventus 1-0 Sassuolo

Parma 1-0 Juventus
Sto cazzo di Angelici deve zittire
Barça's plan is to sign Pogba then send him back to Juve on loan until 2016 when their transfer ban expires. Juve is not in favour of this.
Acc. to Sport, Barcelona offered €70M to Juve for Pogba which was rejected &amp; now Pogba is trying to convince Barça to make a better offer.
Tevez will start alongside Morata, Llorente or Matri. #JuveNews
Pirlo will play. Marchisio, Vidal or Pereyra will be replaced by Sturaro as they are all one yellow card from being suspended. #JuveNews
Juve will play a 4-3-1-2 vs Lazio: Padoin will replace Licht, one of Bonucci or Chiellini will rest for Barzagli. #JuveNews
Tuttosport has an article on Matri today saying how good of a reserve striker he's been for Juve so far.
Sicuramente Cavani; conosce il campionato italiano, alla Juve farà tantissimi gol e io lo vedo perfetto per il 4312 
"Io spero che i miei ex compagni possano andare il più avanti possibile nel torneo e magari vincere la finale con una doppietta di Carlitos"
#Osvaldo: "Non lo so quando accadrà, ma giocare insieme a #Tevez nel Boca sarebbe veramente il massimo per me."
Don't know why #Coutinho is nominated for Player of the Year. He's had a good season but surely not Player of the Year worthy.
Maybe now Montella will understand that Gomez needs to be dropped and he needs to start Babacar.
@RealTlkFootball Plus, there's more of a chance he'll perform I feel
@LeleAngeli Hahahaaa
This is #Wolfsburg's heaviest home defeat in European football. #UEL #WolfsburgNapoli
Wolfsburg need to win 0-4 in the second leg if they want to advance to the semi-finals. #UEL #WolfsburgNapoli
Does anyone rate Napoli's denim kits?
Gabbiadini scored a goal &amp; hit the crossbar after just coming on- he'll always have an impact whether starting or coming off the bench
Ma non ci credo, non ci credo proprio
Napoli are a strong side on their day the problem is you never know when they're gonna show up. Nevertheless their up 0-2 at HT. #UEL
I do not believe it 
IMO Kane, Hazard or Sanchez deserve the PFA award.
@pepigno7 Grande Simooo
Carlitos ha SEMPRE detto che rispetterà il contratto con la Juve e poi si spera di andare al Boca. Basta.
Non capisco tutta questa storia per il contratto ti Tevez, l'interessamento del Boca, etc, etc.
@SandroSca Grande articolo.. Alla fine quel top player in attacco è arrivato e anche per una cifra incredibile
Read @licencetoroam new article on Juve-Monaco - 
VIDAL 
Just went through the whole photo album on my iPad dating back to December 2011. So I pretty much went through Juve's past three seasons.
Top top picture from 2012 ahah 
This photo is actually everything 
Griezmann &amp; Benzema 
@Neymarred Congrats on a great performance. Maybe we'll see Juve-Barça in the semi's!
@samuelJayC <WINKING FACE> 
Isn't impossible for PSG to win 2-0 at the Camp Nou.
Pastore best footballer in world
I said that, in order for L.Enrique to be successful at Barça he needs to find a way to play Messi &amp; Suarez together- he has done just that.
I feel Sirigu could have done better on that goal; had very weak hands on Suarez' shot.
Suarez will always be the nutmeg king.
SUAREZ <FLUSHED FACE>
I have actually forgotten all about Jackson Martinez on Porto.
Matuidi is the left-footed Ramires.
@KhaledAlNouss How was he aloud to do that?
Now Porto has put their faith in him &amp; he's delivering quality performances. Remember he's not THAT old. Only 31.
#LRT - I remember when Quaresma was practically finished. Flopped hard at Inter &amp; Chelsea, was playing in United Arab Emirates two years ago
@WKowalczykIV @gabriele_biondo Good point.. I find it hard to believe really. How was that starting XI the second oldest in history!?
Juve's starting XI yesterday was the second oldest in Champions League history, avg. age was 30 years &amp; 64 days.
Despite missing Ibra, PSG's attack can very well threaten Barca.
Interested to see if PSG can keep possession effectively without Thiago Motta or Verratti.

Giorgio Chiellini (73)
Toni Kroos (65)
Luka Modrić (64)
Andrea Pirlo…
@worldfootballcm Well it's important that they collaborate with the sporting director/Pres b/c there needs to be a purpose signing a player
Klopp is the coach that can get the most out of your players and transform a good player in into a world class player; Milan could use that.
Imagine if Milan could bring Klopp to Italy. Would be ideal to bring them back to the top imo.
Poesia 
#Fiorentina captain Manuel #Pasqual renewed his contract until 2016. #calciomercato #SerieA
Tevez showing off his new tattoo yesterday after the game 
Oh wow, just saw now that Klopp will be officially leaving BvB in the summer.
Good Morning! We're one step closer to the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE semi-finals Juventini!
Vidal proved again yesterday that he's one of the best in terms of recovering balls; he recovered 10 balls, the most from a Juve player.
Max Allegri is the perfect example of "think before putting all the blame on the coach for a teams failures".

Fiducia a Vidal ripagato !!!!
Vidal won 7 tackles vs Monaco. SEVEN.
Jardim non somiglia un po a Di Biagio? Hahaha
Forzaaa Juuuuuuvveee
@ilGoNearPost Jardim is proving an excellent disciple of Sacchi's "defending as a unit", "collective" approach.
@MaraAzzurra89 I really hope everyone keeps his faith in him; we've been with him in good times now we must be with him in his tough times
Ariedo Braida is at the Juventus Stadium watching Juve-Monaco. Did anyone tell him Pogba's not playing?
@ilGoNearPost So far they've been holding their own. Seem to always get that part of their game spot on against everyone.
Would you guys say Vidal is officially playing a level down based on his previous years with Juve? (Not based on todays game)
I'd love to know why Allegri prefers Vidal at LCM &amp; Marchisio at RCM.
Monaco have conceded the least amount of goals in Ligue 1 by the way.
I feel that Monaco will come out strong but Juve will come out STRONGER and show why they deserve to advance to the semi-finals.
players ***
Imagine seeing Juve in the semi-finals of the Champions League. We CAN &amp; WILL do it. #FinoAllaFine #JuveMonaco
No Berbatov for Monaco. Carrasco, Martial &amp; Dirar are all very dangerous playing. We must be on our heels ALL game. #JuveMonaco
We have our strongest line-up playing bar Pogba. I'm confident we'll get a good result. #JuveMonaco
IL MAESTRO È TORNATOOOO !!!
The last time Juve played Monaco - Do you think our lineup is stronger now or back then? 
Come ti senti un ora e mezzo dalla partita?? #JuveMonaco
@ilGoNearPost Yes actually. I don't think Monaco will be able to match us.
Monaco probable XI vs Juve - (433) Subasic, Fabinho, Raggi, R. Carvalho, Kurzawa; Moutinho, Toulalan, Kondogbia; Carrasco, Berbatov, Martial
Juve directors are currently having lunch with Monaco's sporting director Vadim Vasilyev. It's suggested they're talking about the mercato.
#Pirlo is very likely to make his return from injury today &amp; start the match vs Monaco. #JuveNews #JuveMonaco
Juventus probable XI vs Monaco - (4-3-1-2) Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Chiellini, Evra; Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio; Pereyra; Morata, Tevez

I'm not even gonna comment about today's game. There's one clear &amp; simple amswer: everyone was thinking about Monaco, not Parma.
So\to @ProduzioniOblio , Blocco Recordz , Voodoo , RacaiGang

Nice interview on Di Marzio's site from Sassuolo's general director, Giovanni Carnevali about Zaza, Berardi, Di Francesco, etc.
Their previous deals expired this year.
Giuseppe Marotta &amp; Fabio Paratici have renewed their contracts with Juventus for three years. #JuveNews
Secondo me €35M per Dybala sono troppi. Va beh che è giovane ma non è una garanzia che giocherà così bene in una grande squadra.
It was a given really .. 
@montiburns1 Same here. @worldfootballcm is brilliant. The topics he discusses too are awesome.
I remember Armero saying Inzaghi called him &amp; told him how much he wants him at Milan.
Pablo Armero has signed for Flamengo terminating his loan with Milan.
This is everything (creds to @juvefcdotcom) 
Also Allegri is planning to play Pirlo for the last 20 minutes or so to put some minutes in his legs before Monaco.
Juve could play a 4-3-3 vs Parma. Padoin RB, De Ceglie LB, Ogbonna &amp; one of Bonu/Chiell, Pereyra, Marchisio, Sturaro; Pepe, Llorente &amp; Coman
Allegri will be rotating the squad vs Parma to rest some players before the big match vs Monaco in the Champions League. #JuveNews
And I really don't think his decision will change because he's really enjoying his time at Juve.
Tevez said the day he joined Juve, after his three-year contract he's going to go back to Boca. I thoroughly remember that.
More talks about Tevez to Boca. Angelici: "The only way Tevez can return to Boca before his contract ends is if he rescinds."
@montiburns1 Hahaha
@monojuve @stefyjuve32 @MonicaJuventus Che risposta.. Ma vai a cagare

I called Lazio to have a great season from the beginning.
Complimenti alla Lazio. Ci vediamo in finale!
#Barzagli is doubt for the Parma game after suffering a minor problem to his calf during Fiorentina-Juventus warm-up. #JuveNews
Portuguese international, #Varela, scored his first goal for #Parma in their 1-0 earlier today.
Parma seem to be using what is happening to them as a "we'll play for our dignity" kind of thing.
Parma beat Udinese earlier today after they tied Inter on the weekend. They are proving those who say "they have nothing to play for" wrong.
Allegri gave 24 hours of rest to the players who took part in yesterdays game while the others trained normally. #JuveNews
Probably my favourite #Matri goal 
@vanillagirl_86 MITICA!!!!

Fuck, even Marchisio will miss the final due to yellow card accumulation.
.@ClaudioZuliani L'ennesima dimostrazione che sei un grande. Chapeau.
This will be Juventus' 15th final in the Coppa Italia.
@fabiobarto Doubt they'll give it to us though
Questo risultato è per tutti quelli che hanno detto che siamo "Tevez dipendente"
@Minarzouki And won largely too! Amazing.
OLLLLLEEEEEEE !!!!!! GRANDE JUVE
In all fairness that was a yellow not a red but I see why Massa gave him a red.
Morata's gonna miss the final ... FUUCKK
Fucking hell Morata
Coman to come on! Excellent substitution by Allegri. Coman will add something very potent to out counter attacks.
BONUCCCCIIII OOOOHHHH YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Get him to Juventus' clinic ASAP 
@gabriele_biondo True, but Montella knows how to change a result. Hopefully that won't happen here.
Sorry we lost 4-2 not 3-2. Nevertheless, same approach applies.
@MaraAzzurra89 Oh shit that's right! Don't worry we'll forget about that game when we win with a great result today!
I just remembered the last time we were 0-2 up at the Artemio Franchi, Fiorentina came back to win 3-2. We must approach the 2nd half wisely
@BiancoNeroBlog 1-2 will take us to extra time..
If Fiorentina score one goal it'll take the game to extra time. Juve in a good position here. #FiorentinaJuve
@KalininDevin He definitely will. I can see Coman starting..
Che squadra cazzo. Però non è ancora finito. Dobbiamo stare calmi e sereni consapevole dal fatto che la Fiorentina può riaprire la partita.

Shit just saw the news about #Tevez. There'll be an official announcement on the injury soon. #JuveNews
@Johal_101 I'd take Oscar as well but Cavani instead of Dybala
Berardi, Mkhitaryan, Oscar, Vazquez,
Dybala, Jovetic, Cavani, Dzeko, Falcao

If #Juve could sign two of these players who would you sign?

@Adz77 A 4-3-2-1 isn't a bad idea. With Kovacic at LAM &amp; Shaqiri at RAM with Icardi playing ST. Plus Mancini can keep a midfield 3.
33 is almost here ... 
Marchisio will play tomorrow. Allegri said he'll play if he is doing well &amp; I have the feeling he is doing well.
I was supposed to tweet those yesterday but I just found out they never sent and were in my drafts all along. Nevertheless.
To put it in simpler terms, they did what they do best: save &amp; score goals.
Buffon &amp; Tevez were the best players for me as once again they demonstrated their incredible drive, determination &amp; talent.
I thought we defended quite well, however at times we were susceptible to conceding b/c of our own individual mistakes (misplaced passes).
Padoin had a decent game but like I said it would have been much better if he switched positions with Sturaro; those roles suit them more.
Didn't have time to do it after the game so I'll do it now. Here are some of my post-match thoughts. #JuveEmpoli

I don't think Allegri will opt for Padoin as the regista instead of Sturaro who is clearly more suited for that role. #JuveEmpoli

Felipe Anderson put in another top notch performance for Lazio today - 7/12 take ons completed 
However I'm sure Allegri will play Pirlo off the bench vs Parma to put some minutes in his legs before starting him in an important match.
Marchisio is looking very likely to make his return against Fiorentina (Coppa Italia) &amp; Pirlo will make it vs Monaco.
Allegri said yesterday games against Empoli (today) and Parma (next Saturday) will determine 2/3 of Scudetto race.
Allora 11 su 22 gol segnati fin qui son stato di attaccanti.. E ci mancano Salah, Gomez, Eto'o, Muriel, Bergessio, Tevez, Llorente!
Tevez will be important to draw men towards him which will in turn create even more space out wide for Evra &amp; Lichtsteiner to execute.
Both our wing-backs will be key to breaking down Empoli. They'll be in a 4-3-1-2 formation which will leave spaces out wide of course.
Empoli will be a tough side to come against today. We're gonna need Tevez at his best as well as our two wing-backs, Evra &amp; Lichtsteiner.
E anche Sau!!!
FT: Palermo 1-2 Milan. Could have gone either way really, Milan a bit luckier I'd say.
Non dimentichiamo Pinilla, Dybala e Menez!

Ha segnato Brienza!
Speculation saying PADOIN will be playing as the regista.. Like are you serious, PADOIN as our regista!?!? Much more suited at LCM/RCM.
It's pretty simple that he's the best suited for that position. He's good defensively, knows how to circulate the ball &amp; has an engine.
Really hoping Sturaro plays as the deep-lying playmaker today. I don't know why there's so much speculation on who's going to play there.

Zaza hasn't scored in 6 games so I can see why he's been dropped but don't know why Di Francesco would drop Sansone.
Zaza &amp; Sansone not starting for Sassuolo. Every probable formation had them in the starting XI ...
Three players that might leave #Napoli this summer:
Higuain
Mertens
Callejon
Surprised they didn't include Dybala in one of the surprise attackers of the season. Should certainly be there instead of Defrel!
MID - Valdifiori, ATT - Felipe Anderson, Vazquez, Defrel 
Coach - Sarri
Team - Empoli, Sampdoria
Tuttosport has an article on the surprise players, coaches &amp; team of this season. GK - Sportiello, DEF - Rugani, Romagnoli
Last time Roma won at home was back in November, the 30th of November to be exact. Big home win for them here. #RomaNapoli
Napoli's hopes for third post practically gone. Lazio, Samp &amp; Fiorentina have more points with a game in hand. Lazio could go +8 from them.
Feeling #Shaqiri to have a great game vs Parma. I still feel he hasn't exactly proved his worth yet. It will happen though, believe me.
Manolas has very good recovery speed, similar to Koscielny actually.
Let's see if he can give a good performance today.
Disappointing Jorginho couldn't keep up the hype he was under from last season. Not entirely his fault though; Benitez doesn't play him.
Come sempre per il tutto esaurito vi serve la #Juventus.

@chinasourc FUCK OFF
However what's yet to be understood is who is the favourite to buy the club. 75% of the club will be sold, that seems to be clear though.
Reports are saying Berlusconi has been negotiating for some time now with Chinese &amp; Thai businessmen; theirs a lot of interest.
Wow Berlusconi really is selling the club. Reports that he had dinner with Lee Richards (Chinese Businessman) today in Arcore.

#Coman came back from international duty with a muscle problem, Allegri won't wanna risk him against Empoli. #JuveNews
Pirlo is in doubt for the Coppa Italia second leg vs Fiorentina on Tuesday while Marchisio is likely to come off the bench for that game.
Evra will play at LWB. In attack, Tevez might be rested (coming back from ID today) so Llorente will start with either him or Morata.
The trio in midfield will consist of Vidal, Sturaro &amp; Pereyra. Padoin could play instead of Pereyra since he's coming back from ID today.
Lichtsteiner came back from ID with a small problem, he could be rested &amp; Padoin will play. #JuveNews
3-5-2 vs Empoli; Buffon will start in goal, Barzagli likely to start, Bonucci to be rested (Ogbonna will play) &amp; Chiellini will start

@TikiTakaStyle Yeah he plays as a deep-lying playmaker in a 4312
@TikiTakaStyle He's been excellent for Empoli this season.. He's made most passes in Serie A this season
@TikiTakaStyle Vazquez in behind Pellé to form a 3-5-1-1. Just like where he plays with Palermo.
Allora come stiamo combinando? #ITAENG #ForzaItalia
#Gervinho will miss Roma's next three games due to a hamstring injury picked up on international duty.
Pirlo is training but is not 100% yet. #JuveNews
Marchisio is continuing his recovery regime, he should be ready for the Coppa Italia game vs Fiorentina next Tuesday. #JuveNews
The Argentinian duo will return on Thursday, two days before the match vs Empoli. #JuveNews
Vidal returned from international duty yesterday while everyone except Tevez &amp; Pereyra will return tomorrow. #JuveNews
After the war of words between the two, Elkann stated he will say hi to Conte before the game.
Cassano: "Who knows, maybe we'll have another kid. But for that to happen Carolina has to agree... She's the boss!"
Cassano: "It'll be hard for there to be another Cassano. I'm a combination of positive &amp; negative things."
Cassano: "I said no to Bari for family reasons. I want to keep playing but in the future I'd like to be a technical director."
Cassano: "I can't stay without football. I miss it a lot. I miss the dressing room, training, joking around with teammates."
Nice interview from Antonio Cassano on famous Italian gossip magazine 'Chi'. I'll tweet some of the best quotes.

@ManquiIIo Vamooosssss
El Mercurio (Chilean Newspaper) criticized Vidal for his performance yesterday vs Brazil saying he is incapable of playing as a CAM.
@MaraAzzurra89 Aha yes, I kinda like it actually. I still need to finish his book, can't believe how long it's taking me.
@charlesgambino I don't know, he's just going through a poor run right now. I'm sure he'll get out of it, I still believe in him.
#Pirlo was at Hotel Principi of Torino today to visit his Italy teammates &amp; coach Antonio Conte.
@juvaslifestyle I think that if the situation stays the way it is he'll leave in the summer, would love him at Juve granted he plays
@charlesgambino What do you mean?
@charlesgambino Exactly it was right after that game. But you can't just go against him because he isn't in good form atm..
@charlesgambino I favourited it but for some reason it doesn't go as far as October. How can I look for old tweets?
@charlesgambino This was back in October. I remember b/c you responded to my tweet saying you were a big fan of him.
@juvaslifestyle Not quite, ahah. I trust that Beppe will find a replacement. After all they knew he would only stay for 3 years.
@charlesgambino If I'm not mistaken I remember you telling me you are a big fan of Zaza &amp; WANT him at Juve ...
I'm a big fan of Zaza &amp; am really interested in him coming to Juve. In the good or bad I stay with Zaza.
Because of Zaza's poor form lately, everyone seems to be against him coming to Juve- "not good enough", etc.
Italy dropping points sees Croatia two points ahead of Italy in first place.
Dutch quite a few points off top two .. 
That was a shocking game. Team looked very unbalanced, wing-backs weren't producing much, Candreva &amp; Bertolacci poor. Imm-Zaza ok. #BULITA
Continuate a parlare di oriundi però
Mancini sto gol è per te ehh
Bertolacci vale come Marchisio <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
Instead of putting Eder why not Gabbiadini?
Mai visto una squadra di Conte così sbilanciata
Sto cazzo di Immobile mi sta sulle palle
Intanto la Croazia ha vinto 5-1...
Darmian e Antonelli sta facendo un pessimo lavoro ad arretrarsi, più Antonelli che Darmian però Conte deve dire qualcosa.
Candreva interno destro non mi convince. Molto meglio sulla fascia. #BulgariaItalia
Chiellini needs to fucking step!!! Close him down never mind the player in the middle.
SIMOOOOO
Verratti will need to have a good game vs Bulgaria if he wants to keep claims that he can fill in Pirlo
Conte la fatta apposta, è chiaro che lui non vuole più parlare del #CasoMarchisio ma loro continuano a fare le domande
Incredible news, Marchisio has been ruled out of any ACL damage to his knee &amp; will be at Allegri's disposal for Juventus-Monaco. #JuveNews
Solo in Italia queste cose può succedere... #CasoMarchisio
@Marcocalcio22 Where are you getting this interview from? Video or just an article?
Can't wait to read about this whole SCENE in Marchisio's book in a few years...

Allegri will give the players the weekend off &amp; return training on Monday. #JuveNews
#Pirlo had a special training session today to recover as fast as possible for the Coppa Italia &amp; of course the Champions League. #JuveNews
This would be our strongest line-up with the players currently at disposal: (352) Gi; Barz, Bon, Chi; Lich, Vidal, Pirlo, Per, Evr; Tev, Mor
Good thing we got Barzagli back. Now we can play a back 3 with no worries.
Ppl are just looking for ways to hate on Conte.Some are valid some are not. Blaming him for a player getting injured is certainly not valid.
@Adz77 &amp; 
SIAMO TUTTI CON TE CAMPIONE! @ClaMarchisio8 
Vidal needs to really step it up &amp; play on the levels he was at in previous years. Vidal-Pirlo-Pereyra ... I have faith.

Cazzo centra Conte con l'infortunio di Marchisio !!!???
@fabiobarto Can you please tell me how it's his doing? I understand you don't like him but don't get mad at him for nothing...
@Mimmo_25 Quello che non piace a me e che quelli che sta incazzando con Conte solo per farlo, senza un buon motivo
@Mimmo_25 Sicuramente, come dovrebbe essere tutto li allenatori quando uno dei giocatori si infortunasse in Nazionale
@Mimmo_25 Ma Florenzi e Pasqual non erano infortunati prima come Barzagli. Ma se Barzagli si infortunasse allora Conte può essere colpevole.
To get mad at the coach of a NT because a player gets injured while on NT duty sounds a bit ridiculous. Do you do that for your club team?
I understand the frustration but to rip on Conte for Marchisio getting injured makes no sense.
@Mimmo_25 Ma non è mica colpa dell'allenatore... Per dire che è mi sembra un po ridicolo
@Mimmo_25 Ma perché ce l'avete con Conte?
Can't believe it.. Marchisio pretty much out for the rest of the season.

Juventus had their first training session of the week today after two days of rest. Here are some photos #JuveNews: 
@CreepN Plus only one referee was claimed guilty &amp; of the games it was said he fixed it wasn't even a Juve game
@CreepN Yes it was! It was cleared.
"I've always been average football wise but I worked very hard, 90% of times the difference is your desire to achieve &amp; your humbleness."
Love this quote from Zappacosta - 

Morata: "A Buffon è impossibile segnare in partitella, a volte mi sistemo dietro Pirlo per capire come batte i calci di punizione."
@jacksonalvares9 @DavidAmoyal @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 So you tell me were you linked with him or not? 
@jacksonalvares9 @DavidAmoyal @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 You guys were linked with him as early as last December!
@jacksonalvares9 @DavidAmoyal @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 So what sources do you deem credible then?
Morata: "Llorente? He's not only a teammate but a friend. I won't forget everything's he has done for me." 
@jacksonalvares9 @DavidAmoyal @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 THEN YOU WOULD KNOW YOU GUYS WERE LOOKING AT CERCI
@jacksonalvares9 @DavidAmoyal @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 Do you even follow your club?
@DavidAmoyal @jacksonalvares9 @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 Exactly
Morata: "Llorente? Non è solo un compagno di squadra, è un amico. Non dimenticherò mai quello che ha fatto per me." 
@jacksonalvares9 @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 @DavidAmoyal Can you please team him David..
@jacksonalvares9 @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 Keep being deluded? Did you follow the story at all last summer?
Morata: "Sono così felice qui che non posso neanche pensare all'idea di essere al Madrid o ad un'altra squadra." 
This is the second interview in two days from Morata both talking about how much he's enjoying his time at Juve.
@jacksonalvares9 @Johal_101 @ADP1113 @OrpheusJone5 Dead league? Probably coming from someone who hasn't watched a Serie A game in their life

Juve has a very strong chance to get back their two Scudetti &amp; some money imo. They have a strong argument to present the FIGC.
Di Maria &amp; his agent are pushing for a move away from Old Trafford after recent problems with Van Gaal. [The Sun]
@ClaBotta @Michel_le_Roi @calciommerda Sai che lui lo fa espressamente perché vuole essere ritwittato...
If Kovacic is leaving Inter I'd love for Juve to sign him. Incredible potential, just hasn't found the proper environment to succeed yet.

@Calciology I don't think Smalling would go to Lazio tbh .. It's a bit strange to see English players in Serie A
Juve taking time on the Zaza deal while Napoli is putting themselves forward to sign the striker. #JuveNews (via @carlolaudisa)
Also it'll justify that he deserves to play for Juve.
Really hope Zaza puts in two good performances for Italy. He hasn't be scoring lately so playing well here will do him good.
Morata: "Sto in un ottimo momento di forma. Sono felice perché ho dimostrato di poter essere qui." 
@WalksWithLenny Exactly which is why I'm saying I hate those people that label us without knowing the real story
Conte tried this formation in today's training session: (3-5-2) Gigi; Barz, Bonu, Chi; Darmian, Candre, Verratti, March, Pasqual; Imm, Zaza
@WalksWithLenny Yes, but b/c Juve was the best team in Italy everyone was looking for ways to bring them down so they got hit the hardest
Finally the truth comes out. Will the truth leak into the public eye? I doubt it b/c those claiming Juve cheated never researched the topic.
Ever since Calciopoli started I have ALWAYS backed Juve &amp; defended them  from any idiot telling me they're cheaters, frauds, etc.
@CreepN Thieves suing for losses? Yes, suing b/c money was un rightly taken from there. I'll reiterate, before commenting research the topic
@No1_Juve_Fan 
@CreepN @DavidAmoyal @abomovich Please look into the topic before making stupid claims, thanks.
@worldfootballcm @AntonioCorsa @agiamba This could have resulted in Conte getting fired midseason completely ruining his relationship w/Juve
@worldfootballcm @AntonioCorsa @agiamba would see them get poor results &amp; wouldn't have been the same team as previous years..
@worldfootballcm @AntonioCorsa @agiamba And now that I think about it, the team could have gotten tired of Conte's constant pushing which
Rugani: "I never had any posters of anyone in particular, but I have always been a #Juventus fan. I had a Del Piero jersey."
Hahaha 
Lol “@Ahmed__Wagih: Juventini must pray that Pippo doesn't field El Shaarawy and Menez together from the start next Saturday.”
I think this is a good time to bring this article up, the truth about Calciopoli - 
@DictatePlay Very very good point. People don't realize or take this in consideration &amp; they are so easy to bash him.
Need to get caught up on todays news. Calciopoli trials are back, Conte interview, Azzurri, etc.
Juventus players have been awards two days of rest &amp; will start training on Wednesday. #JuveNews
@StereoSerieA Perfect time for International Break to pop up
@KhaledAlNouss Not about improving, it's about putting some minutes in his legs after his injury
@TharaAzzam Why b/c he's scoring more?
Llorente needs to score more goals. For the better of the team &amp; so his price tag goes up!
Foooorrrrrzzzaaaaa JUVE!
@ManquiIIo Busquets has got to be in the middle mate
Mamma Mia <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> “@bestemmiedigigi: I M B A R A Z Z A N T E 
Only thing good about Milan getting 'that' penalty is the precious fantacalcio points Menez gave me.
Destro not scoring goals with Milan b/c he doesn't get the service he got at Roma. Milan need to create more chances to see him score more.
Cerci has been really poor since joining Milan, don't why Conte has called him up.
Despite just making a full return to fitness, Conte has called Barzagli to the NT! #JuveNews
Milan supporters not showing up to the stadium obviously isn't good but this is why I love Calcio ... So much more to it then what you think
@juveennio Yeah I know I just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was directing it to you
@juveennio Like I said they're in the QFs for a reason.. Can't underestimate (in general, not directed to you)
@Zizouology Oh yeah! He's going to he one of the best in the world. So dominant in the air, always concentrated &amp; just so solid.
+++ Marchisio e Sturaro convocato per Juve-Genoa +++ #JuveNews
The story of Harry Kane is amazing, just amazing.
@mikedichoxx Yeah I think I agree. Especially because Allegri knows how to secure a win first leg &amp; get the result needed second leg.
@agiamba Conte took him to the next level &amp; he grew a lot under his reign. Know way I would consider him average during Conte years.
@agiamba How can you say that? Marchisio was revitalized by CONTE'S arrival. Allegri's arrival just also proved another side of him.
Tifosi Romanisti vs Walter Sabatini - 
Do you think playing the first leg at home is an advantage or playing the second leg at home is an advantage?
Maifredi (Zaza's agent) is completely lying to himself. He claims he knows nothing about Zaza's future &amp; Juve's interest in him. PA-LEASE!
This Spain call-up for #Morata is just another representation of how good he's been recently &amp; how much he has improved.
Del Bosque: "Ma dobbiamo anche pensare al presente e crediamo in lui in questo momento."
Del Bosque: "Abbiamo riposto molte speranze in lui, pensiamo di trovarci davanti al futuro della Seleccion."
Del Bosque: "In alcune partite si è espresso in maniera normale, ora sembra che vada meglio."
Del Bosque su Morata: "Morata è il futuro della Spagna. Ma è anche il presente. Come ogni giovane, ha avuto i suoi momenti difficili."
Pirlo will miss Juventus' game vs Genoa &amp; will not get called to Italy. The international break will be a perfect time for Pirlo to recover.
Del Bosque has called Morata to the NT! 
Top interview from Falcao's first ever agent &amp; current mentor about all things Falcao - 
@Mr__Freak We could make do without Pogba though, especially against Monaco.
@Mr__Freak Some great news to wake up to that's for sure!! But we must not underestimate them, they are in the QFs for a reason
MONACO!!!!!
On the weekend they face Sampdoria, another tough tough side to play against. This game is a big test for Inter.
Has Mancini really had any impact with Inter so far? Some games they look like they're improving &amp; others they look like they're hopeless.
@Marcocalcio22 He said it referring to signing the players at the wrong time (no immediate impact) &amp; not disputing their quality
Sabatini: "Dimettersi oggi sarebbe una fuga e non sono abituato a scappare. Ma dovrò pensare a quello fatto, nei prossimi mesi."
And the only time he does gets injured it's for 50 DAYS <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
This is the first time Pogba has every been sidelined for a long time because of injury. As of now he has never missed a game due to injury.
Epic photo of De Rossi confronting Roma tifo - 
Lesson learned by Rudi Garcia: never open your mouth &amp; say stupid things unless you are certain b/c it'll come back to bite you in the ass
@K_Khatib93 @Marcocalcio22 Yes that's why you need to be smart &amp; make the right judgement if it's worth over spending or not
@K_Khatib93 @Marcocalcio22 Exactly. But the clubs try to get as much as possible b/c the player wants to leave &amp; so price gets inflated

Even in Conte's first year in the Champions League he got to the Quarter-Finals, losing to the eventual winners.

According to @calciomercatoit, Juventus will exercise their option to re-buy Zaza in the summer for €15M &amp; put him on €2.2M/year.
E quindi sono molto fiducioso che faremmo propio quello, passare il turno.
Quello che ha detto Sacchi è cento per cento corretto. Allegri sa perfettamente cosa deve fare per passare il turno.
Sacchi: " ... convinti che il miglior propellente per vincere è praticare il proprio gioco senza paura."
Sacchi: "Non lascerà il comando agli avversari e cercherà di ribattere colpo su colpo. Credo che i bianconeri giocheranno da protagonisti,
Sacchi: "Ma Allegri è un allenatore esperto e capace, punterà su organizzazione e gioco."
Sacchi: " ... potrebbe perfino resuscitare un Borussia in chiara difficoltà."
Sacchi: "Se giocherà all’italiana vecchia maniera, lasciando gioco e iniziativa al rivale, asserragliata al limite dell’aerea, ...
@mikemacaroni @DavidAmoyal But this is also in reference to the great debate we had last week between Verratti &amp; Pogba's transfer value Mike
According to Sport Mediaset, Juventus will meet with Dybala's agent in the coming days to discuss a possible transfer &amp; contract conditions.

@TharaAzzam Don't underestimate them. They're in the Quarter-Finals for a reason.
Shocking clearance from Monaco resulting in Ramsey scoring! I can see Arsenal pulling it off here!!
I always hear them getting compared &amp; complimenting eachother but this is the first picture Ive seen of them together 
Plus, Barzagli-Bonucci-Chiellini is the perfect trio of DFs to defend counter attacks; speed, intelligence &amp; excellent reading of the game.
Going into the game vs Dortmund with a 3-5-2 is a good idea. It's a great formation to prevent &amp; stop counter attacks which BvB are good at.
Incredibile il calo della Roma. In Agosto me l'ha aspettata la Roma in primo posto e la Juve in secondo.
Kohler: "My prediction? I think Dortmund will go 3-0 up and eventually win the match 3-1."

I'd be the first one to say I thought Roma were gonna win the Scudetto this year &amp; Juve would come in second. Incredible how things turn out
Sore losers NEVER win. Until they get rid of this awful mentality Roma will never win.

@AshJuventino I guess they feel abandoned because they wanted something more from their better players which they're not getting

@worldfootballcm Well imo I think at the start of the season they did &amp; it showed in their performances now they just lost all hope
@worldfootballcm you could tell Pippo strongly believed in his team &amp; in their objectives. They played with much more belief I feel.
@worldfootballcm He lost his faith in this team &amp; that's transmitting to his players. For example if you look at the beginning of the season
more out of him as a striker. 2/2
I don't know if Mihaijlovic is getting it right playing Eto'o as a trequartista. He played good there last week but surely you get 1/2
Sampdoria have two Roma youth players in their starting XI: Romanogli &amp; Okaka.
Roma have started this match good. They are actually looking like the REAL Roma.
Eder has an Italian citizenship and never got called for Brazil therefore making him eligible for Conte to pick.
Inzaghi has lost full confidence in his team. He hasn't been able to transmit the same belief he had at the beginning of the season now.
No "hip hip hurra" for Milan tonight...

#RomaSampdoria ... Roma can't keep distancing themselves from Juve while a win for Sampdoria would propel back in contention for third.
#TorinoLazio ... Torino need to confirm themselves in the Top 10 &amp; Lazio have the golden chance to go in third with a win.
#FiorentinaMilan ... Montella will be looking to put his team back in good form while Inzaghi will be fighting for his job.
Three excellent match ups in Serie A today: 

Fiorentina-Milan
Torino-Lazio 
Roma-Sampdoria
Maybe Sunderland can bring someone in to do what Gus Poyet did last year when he was first appointed.
@Mimmo_25 Che bei ricordi!!!
Glad to see Osvaldo is enjoying his time at Boca. I wonder if Conte would still consider him for the NT despite playing in Argentina.
After the 0-4 loss at home to Aston Villa, Gus Poyet has been sacked as manager of Sunderland. #PremierLeague
PERCHÉ !!!!!!!?????? Dimmi Perché!!?? @RaiTv 
@DTenenbaum @JuventusNation This used to be said vice-versa
@Calciodiction Recommend me some nice, easy to listen to rap atm
LOL Ibra
Bobo Vieri is livin' the life isn't he
Speaking about NT call-ups I don't think Conte will call Pelle. Hes been on a huge goal drought &amp; he'll look to give other players a chance.
@EpyAle Ahahha il "tehnihamente" è stupendo <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Divock Origi everywhere! 
Since when did Emeghara sign for San Jose Earthquakes in the MLS! Completely missed that.
Happy Birthday to OUR Paul Pogba! 
Pellegrini is not a manager for a top club. More of a manager for a 5-6th place team who can bring them up to 3-4th place.
But when Pirlo comes back from injury Allegri's gonna have to make a tough decision and drop a CB or one of our "magnificent four".
So so glad Barzagli is back. I think Allegri might just stick with the 3-5-2 now so he doesn't have to drop Bonucci or Barzagli.

FORZA  SAMP
@Copa90 Ahahah love this
This is why Juventus is where they are. Throughout there history they've had game-changers. Today was another example of that. #INNAMorata

Morata will only get better if he is given the proper faith &amp; confidence.
This is JUVENTUS!
FORZA JUVE! Very tough game ahead of us!
BvB's starting XI today - (4-2-3-1) Weidenfeller, Kirck, Subotic, Hummels, Schmelzer, Kehl, Gundogan, Reus, Kagawa, Mkhitarian, Aubameyang
Now it's time to see if Marchisio or Sturaro is playing as a regista.
Juve will be playing in their blue jerseys! #PalermoJuve
Well done to Pulis. Another win for West Brom. Another goal for Ideye.
Arsenal are really risking it here. Hasn't looked like they've been in control since the second half started.
@enpinton <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JuventusWAR So good to see the REAL BBC playing together again!
@ItalianoCalcio Yes he's in the official staring XI
OFFICIAL line-up! #PalermoJuve #JuveNews
I'd really like to see Pepe at RWB and rest Lichtsteiner. Pepe has been looking good recently &amp; I'd want the momentum to continue.
Juve's probable formation I just tweeted was from Sky. They have Sturaro playing as a RCM with Marchisio playing as the regista.
Juventus probable XI vs Palermo: Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Lichtsteiner, Sturaro, Marchisio, Pereyra, De Ceglie; Llorente, Tevez
Allegri did mention in his press-conference that Stuaro can play in both positions so we're just waiting to see who he prefers where.
Plus Marchiso is much better &amp; more of a threat going forward than Sturaro. I just hope Allegri realizes this.
I much rather have Stuaro playing as the DLP &amp; Marchisio at LCM. Stuaro has more of the characteristics of a DLP than a LCM in a 3 man mid.
@_Kenny_Kerr_ It is. I highly suggest you to watch all four seasons, it keeps getting better and better.
The Renzo Barbera is always a great place to play at. Beautiful stadium, beautiful setting and always a top, top atmosphere.
@agiamba Ohhh. Tweet can be a bit misleading ahaha. But yeah I can see why: too many twists.

Verratti "Last time I said Juve &amp; he SMS'ed me telling …
@agiamba Omg it's sooo good. I was obsessed with it for a week after I watched it.
That Bonucci goal vs Palermo in 2012 was probably his most important goal in Juve colours &amp; marked a historic win for Antonio Conte's Juve.
Therefore, any chance of Juve playing a 4-3-3 is out of the door. We could play a 3-5-2 or 4-3-1-2. #PalermoJuve #PT
#Coman won't make the trip to Sicily. He is still suffering from the injury he picked up against Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia. #JuveNews
If Morata will start against BvB then play Llorente vs Palermo. Matri can sub in.
Allegri: "Abbiamo dovuto fare a meno di Caceres, Asamoah, Barzagli, Romulo e per un bel periodo anche di Pirlo, un giocatore fondamentale."
Allegri: "Non mi piace parlare di migliori o peggiori: c'è chi ha giocato di più e chi di meno."
Unlike other times Allegri has actually admitted that he will rest those who'll play vs BvB. We could see the likes of Sturaro &amp; Matri.
Allegri:"Se qualcuno non è in grado di giocare ogni 5g vuol dire che si è allenato male/non ha il motore per giocare in una grande squadra."
We could also see Stuaro &amp; Matri (second time) make their debuts.
Would be great to see Barzagli return in the starting XI on Saturday vs Palermo.
@DavidAmoyal The fact Pogba scores incredible goals is what gets his price tag up &amp; gets the hype that goes with it.
Napoli already losing!
Barzagli could be in the starting XI vs Palermo. #JuveNews
Allegri is evaluating which formation to play vs Palermo. Either a 4-3-1-2 or 4-3-3. #JuveNews
@Being_Max Atm yes! Chelsea too. But every clubs fans are victim to this.
After a lot of success it is simply normal for their to be a hiccup or two during the season. A shame when fans don't understand this.
It's actually ridiculous to see some fans so quick to bash their manager when something goes wrong after a ton of success.
@MessiMinutes If I'm not mistaken this was from last year's tie!
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> “@Bakes135: The sheer number of shithouses under one roof tonight was pretty amazing.

@Zizouology Yes because one chose to while the other didn't
The irony in David Luiz coming back to the bridge &amp; knocking Chelsea out of the Champions League.
@KuperSimon Ibra was a liability today. Him not having any movement whatsoever was helping PSG; red card was a blessing in disguise.
So thirsty for RTs “@CFCNaser_: Mourinho has to be sacked idc”
BUT THE PREMIER LEAGUE IS THE BEST LEAGUE IN THE WORLD!!!!!

I knew it Zlatan's red card would be a blessing in disguise for PSG.
Compliments to Laurent Blanc's PSG. They deserved to go through. #UCL
What a top top game. This is why we LOVE the Champions League.
Either individual errors, set-piece goals, pure luck is what would separate these two teams before the game. Set-piece goals is the winner!
Loool my whole timeline happy Chelsea's going out
Pastore has been great. <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Told you!!!!!!!!
SIIILLLLVVVAAAAAA
I didn't even realize PSG still only needed one goal to get back in the tie!
Told you. Game over.
Verratti &amp; Thiago Motta can take on the midfield by themself. Bring on Lavezzi for Pastore.
If Chelsea get one good chance they'll score. If not I see PSG scoring.
adding that numerical advantage in midfield despite PSG in 10 men.
I don't know if I would take off Pastore and add more of a direct attacking threat.. He's doing a great job keeping the ball and
I never rated Thiago Motta but I must say he's having a good match.
Chelsea-PSG is still on. Don't go thinking that the red card kills the game off. PSG still in it.
Not to mention, Chelsea will be more relaxed now.
This red card could actually favour PSG. Cavani can move to the centre now &amp; Matuidi is capable of playing LW &amp; LCM; he has the legs for it.
C'è gente che penso per davvero che spenderemo €40M per Dybala...
With Pirlo injured &amp; Pogba suspended it is likely Sturaro will be given his debut against Palermo. #JuveNews #PalermoJuve
Recap - Allegri will evaluate the possibility of doing a "turnover" against Palermo to rest players for the CL clash vs Dortmund. #JuveNews
Recap - Allegri gave Juve players a day of rest today &amp; they will begin training again tomorrow in preparation for Palermo-Juve. #JuveNews
@Being_Max That's what I mean by saying ever when they're playing poorly they still manage to score two goals
Even when Real Madrid are poor they're still good.
Conte will return to the Juventus Stadium on March 31! Italy-England friendly game!
After playing 5-6 games, Cristian Rodriguez has rescinded his contract with Parma after signing in January. He is now with Gremio.
@GiuSette7 Ma dai...
@Fabrocca @CalcioDirect Buddy have you heard of Carlos Tevez.. Yes it's not long term but it sure is short term.
Balotelli visited Milanello today.
@GiuSette7 Se questo ti fa rendere più felice, Zaza ha segnato due volte contro la Juve ;)
#piazzavittorio #33 
Love this 
@GiuSette7 Si ma oggi la difesa della Juve è stato impeccabile. Non ha concesso proprio nulla.
AND we've got Barzagli back. Woooooo hoooooooooooo <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>
@GiuSette7 Sai che loro stavano giocando contro la JUVE con una squadra molto inferiore..Mica facile
Oh and I almost forgot, SIAMO A +11!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Evra was really really good. Best game in a Juve jersey imo.
Chiellini was AMAZING. Won EVERYTHING in the air &amp; his anticipations were second to none.
Incredible. What a game.
Now Juve can get many more players in the box making it easier to score.
With the introduction of Llorente, Sassuolo is now defending very deep inside their box which favours Juve.
Pereyra played well. I would have liked to see him stay on the pitch longer however Pepe will do.
I'd give Matri his second debut. Matri for Morata would work.
Bonucci-Chiellini have been superb so far.
We're growing! Keep this up!!!
Pereyra has been great in possession. Very efficient.
What a goal Biglia!
Many people will say Juve are playing shit just because we haven't scored yet. Much more to the game than goals.
Goals WILL be scored in the second half. #JuveSassuolo
Three panenka scored penalties this weekend: Toni, Icardi &amp; Altidore
Ben messa la difesa del Sassuolo. #JuveSassuolo
DAI JUVE!
Today will be the first time Juventus Stadium hosts a game on a Monday. #JuveSassuolo 
Gianfranco Zola has been fired. Zeman will return to the Cagliari bench. #Zemanlandia RETURNS.
Juventus-Sassuolo today <MEDIUM WHITE CIRCLE>️<MEDIUM BLACK CIRCLE>️
Tomorrow will be the first time Juventus Stadium hosts a game on a Monday. #JuveSassuolo
@AlfanoToni Stesso discorso per me ahaha
They need to be careful and make sure they don't make a step down cause they sure are risking it.
Imo they haven't made that final step up needed to be an actual title contender.
Napoli tied against Inter 2-2 after being 2-0 up. This is the hundredth time they've failed to close the gap between them &amp; Roma.
Wouldn't it have been better if Allegri played our strongest line-up vs Fiorentina &amp; rest players vs Sassuolo instead of vice-versa?
Acc. to @calciomercatoit, Milan have decided to keep Inzaghi. Berlusconi wanted to fire him however he was convinced otherwise by Galliani.
Tell me what is the point in sacking Inzaghi to sign an interim manager who'll most likely get you the same results. #Milan

Very nice to see everyone's support for Mattiello. He'll need all the support he get. Keep it coming. #ForzaMattiello

Chievo are actually giving Roma a game here. Hopefully it continues for the whole game. #ChievoRoma
In bocca al lupo Fede! Torna più forte di prima! @mattiellofede
Oh my gosh, just saw what happened to Mattiello. So unfortunate,
Well in Quags
@TweetGino @EpyAle @Michel_le_Roi le occasioni che ho 2/2
@TweetGino @EpyAle @Michel_le_Roi La Juve non è capace a spendere €40M per un "TOP" player quindi devi lavorare sfruttando 1/2
@Gavolski They're the best attacking trio in the world for me, better than BBC
How GOOD is Neymar-Suarez-Messi????
@Cynegeticus Yes yes
I'm really not phased at all about what Giovinco said about Juve yesterday; I wish him all the best in Toronto.
@AaronCampeau Hahahahha
@Cynegeticus Oh shit that's right.. Yeah they're 2-1-0, they tied yesterday vs Mexico who are favourites to win the group
@Cynegeticus Do you see them as favourites (Brazil) to winning it? What's your take on Canada?
@Cynegeticus Are you following the tournament?
Can see Giovinco being one of the standout players in the MLS this year, if not THE standout player. Top stuff.
Giovinco had quite a good debut for TFC. Assisted Altidore's goal &amp; was very close to scoring.
There's really no point to sack Inzaghi &amp; get a new coach just for the sake of it. Better to wait until the summer &amp; do major re-building.
Milan's best bet is to stick with Inzaghi until the end of the season. No manager atm could drastically change Milan's fortunes.
Milan currently sit in 10th place with the chance to go to 11th if Palermo win tomorrow. #Ouch
Menez suffered 6 fouls vs Verona - 
@jup1897 Più Zaza per me .. Ma sarebbe meglio se prediamo tutti e due
@Footy_Jokes Tevez was City's top scorer in 10/11 season you idiots not to mention he played 47 games for City in 12/13 season ..
Giovinco to the MLS has brought so much more coverage of the tournament in Italy. This is first time I've seen GdS cover the MLS.
So much for Reus going to be in doubt for Juve... He started BvB's Bundesliga game today.
@ItalianoCalcio I feel he'll be leaving
Enjoy your day today!
#PRT - I WANT KPB AT JUVE

Unfortunate since he was showing signs of gaining his old form back. #PT #Gomez
Mario Gomez (KOmez) has suffered an ankle injury and will therefore be out for at least two weeks.
Acc. to Le10Sport, P$G have agreed a verbal agreement with Paul Pogba for €10M/year. #JuveNews
Kudos to Giovinco who actually admitted he mostly came to TFC because of the economic aspects &amp; didn't give some bullshit.
Giovinco: "I had originally been unsure if I was going to make an impact at Juve; I was able to thanks to A.C., who really wanted me there."
Peluso: "Ricordo bene la gara dell'anno scorso proprio contro il Sassuolo: fare un gol con quella maglia non capita spesso."
Peluso: "Lo Juventus Stadium? Ti dà qualcosa in più, è uno stadio unico in Italia."
Hahaha top stuff from Lucas Piazon 
Ma non ti preoccupare .. Il Principino will stay forever! 
Reports circling around saying many PL clubs are interested in signing Marchisio if he doesn't renew with Juventus.
... is if he actually starts with the right mentality.
Thinking again about yesterdays game, the only way I'll believe Allegri sees the CI as a real objective ...
@IFDMascitti What a man
@PureCatenaccio Hb the fact Salah was never given a chance?
Of course Allegri is gonna back up everything he stated in his pre-match press conference ...
These would have been the plaudits #Salah would get if he actually played at Chelsea.
I'm actually happy Salah has been playing this well since moving to Fiorentina, unfortunately one of those performances came against Juve.
Minchia... @gnoccao “@iLGDaily: Emily Ratajkowski <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Is Juventus in their worst form under Allegri?
Compliments to Fiorentina though. The came to the JStadium to play intense football &amp; come out with a good result &amp; succeeded. #CoppaItalia
Fucking hell man.. Allegri says that he'll play the best players &amp; does the complete opposite
[2,841] Bundesliga
[2,609] Serie A
[2,608] La Liga
[2,550] Premier League
[2,357] Li…
@forumJuventus Te lo detto!!!!
LLLLOOOORRRRRRRREENNNTTEEE
I'm sorry but stop freaking about Salah-this is the player he always was, obviously you can't see that when he's sitting on the bench though
Fucking hell Salah
Like I said ... 
Juve probable XI (4-3-3): Storari; Caceres, Bonucci, Ogbonna, Padoin; Vidal, Marchisio, Pogba; Pepe, Llorente, Coman
#FORZAJUVE
@forumJuventus Llorente
One of the Juventus Stadium's best choreography over its 4 year history - 
The sales of important players such as Consigli &amp; Bonaventura really effected the team. Colantuono had always done well despite sales.
Colantuono did have to deal with a lot of important players being sold throughout the years but especially this past summer.
Missed the sacking of Colantuono! He did a lot for Atalanta but results suggesting they did need a change.
Acc. to Tuttosport, UEFA will hand Inter severe punishments due to breaching FFP rules such as a €6M fine &amp; a limited roster for UEFA compe.
@Calciodiction That's true. Yesterday he meg'd two players in like 5 minutes..
@Calciodiction Felipe Anderson has really only been good since January
Allegri saying he won't do a "turnover" means he doesn't believe in it not that the players who have played less won't play.
Would be quite a surprise &amp; a bold move to me if Allegri starts Pepe &amp; Coman. He did state that he would play the best.
Sturaro might even make his debut tomorrow. He did get called after missing out vs Roma due to injury.
Anyone could be rested tomorrow, even Tevez. So don't be surprised if there's a sudden change in the official XI from the predicted line up.
However, probable lineups everywhere are predicting there to be 4 or 5 changes from the team who played vs Roma.
Allegri stated in his press conference that Juve will be serious contenders for the Coppa Italia therefore there will he no turnover.
Bild &amp; Metro have linked him to Juve but also Inter &amp; Arsenal. Allegri was the one who got the best out of KPB at Milan as a trequartista.
Boateng linked to Juve! Finally! This player would be perfect for Juve in the trequartista role &amp; he would play under Allegri again!
Many voting #Salah as best signing in January but how about #Gabbiadini? #SerieA
Hendo!!
Marotta &amp; Moggi stated that they never tried signing Cassano while he stated that he rejected Juve four times.
#Bonucci is the definition of what it means to be a Juventus player. Plain and simple.
Despite getting subbed off yesterday, #Reus has only suffered a small ankle injury &amp; will therefore be available to face Juventus. #JuveNews
Dani Alves' agent, Dinorah Santana: "We are close to signing for another. Dani wants to renew with Barça but he won't wait forever."

@ManquiIIo Bottom right... More of a casual runner than a runner you use to workout
@Being_Max That's a good point- everything happens for a reason
It's good to see Allegri &amp; the players were upset after the tie; shows their concentration &amp; desire to close the league as early as possible
This isn't just any random guy by the way, this is Carles Rexach, former Barcelona player &amp; coach. 
This is the same guy who said Messi didn't perform last season because he "ate too much pizza" .......
@charlesgambino @Hernan1897 @JuventusWAR @AmmarAbdelghani We wont pay 15M straight up I don't think, Marotta will try&amp;find his way around it

Aubameyang on his Batman &amp; Robin celebration - 
The #Bundesliga really does a great job broadcasting their league through Youtube. Highlights, interviews, etc. to engage viewers.
I'm gonna try and find how many goals Juve have conceded on set-pieces this season under Allegri.
I would have liked to see Allegri be asked after the game on Juve's 4-4-2 structure when defending. Noticed they reverted to this a lot.
Beautiful picture of Totti...

@Marcocalcio22 How did this start?
Tiki Taka Part 2 - 
Tiki Take Part 1 - 
@hashim0307 So you're leaving him absolutely ZERO margin for error..?
We have seen Juve concede right after just scoring waaaaay too many times.
I think one of the main improvements we can affiliate Allegri's Juve with is to avoid conceding after just going ahead.
@MilanJarr @StereoSerieA Just to clear something up- Juve went to CL QFs in 12/13 season (lost to eventual winners)
@hashim0307 Are you serious.. No like seriously. You gotta be kidding me.
Tevez come Zidane!
"I am the captain now" 
I planned this game to end completely differently 7 months ago.
Sucks we couldn't win but I'm happy with this result. #FinoAllaFine
Roma 1-1 Juventus ... Four shots on target in total, two goals from set-pieces ... That pretty much sums up the match #RomaJuve
WHAT A PHOTO <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
1-1 is a good result. Remember we're always +9 from Roma. #SerieA
FT: Roma 1-1 Juventus
GOOOOAAALLLL I CALLED IT!!!!!
Correct red card, Vidal was through on goal
Tevez to score..
RED!
@Diegoe_09 Yeah but BvB are more counter attacking based
@fabiobarto Overrated!? Try underrated!
@Juventusfc_news to defending in 5
@Juventusfc_news Makes sense too b/c Caceres can play RB.. I see why Allegri is playing this; it is a better way to counter attack compared
This has been a major problem for #Roma this season; keeping possession but doing nothing with it.
Forza juuuveee
LOL “@SerieA_TIM: It is to be hoped that #RomaJuve will be another chapter of a beautiful friendship. 
We're gonna need THIS GUY at his best today! #KingArturo #RomaJuve 
Juventus will be without #Pirlo &amp; #Pogba today as both are suffering from injuries. Latter will start from the bench. 
@RossonerOgo_3 @SerieAFFC @CalcioTown Nice article. And I think it's safe to say Allegri is gaining back respect since last season.
When you come to think of it, Llorente scored 18 goals (in all competitions) last year. Wow.
#FinoAllaFine
@Being_Max I think it all spiralled downwards after there exit in the CL, from there I feel Garcia has failed to motivate his team
@Being_Max But I'm saying it in a more practical way; this shows how Juve can beat the second best team in Serie A without two KEY players
However it would prove once again Juventus' incredible force.
If we manage to beat Roma at the Olimpico without Pirlo &amp; Pogba I'll be quite impressed.
Due to Pirlo's injury &amp; Pogba's uncertain conditions, Allegri will likely field a 3-5-2 today with Vidal-Marchisio-Pereyra in the middle.
Ibra like! “@PortuBall: Jackson's magic backheel assist vs Sporting! 
Paratici's contract is expiring this summer &amp; despite interest from Tottenham it is very likely he'll renew with Juve. #JuveNews
#ArsenalEverton Very important 3 points for Arsenal who take advantage of a Manchester City slip up. They are now 4 points from second.
Just noticed Sturaro did not get called because of a small problem to his knee. #JuveNews
@ItalianoCalcio Expect goals!
Pogba &amp; Vidal both chosen to make the trip to Rome for tomorrow's game. #JuveNews
#Sampdoria return to winning ways with an inspired Eto'o, Okaka &amp; Muriel trio!
Well they didn't exactly pour out but some did come.. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>

Cesena break the deadlock! <SMIRKING FACE>
Lazio just scored...
Watch there be pouring goals in the final third of each game. #SerieA
Second goal for Muriel with Sampdoria!
Muriel!
I'm not ruling anything out tomorrow. It'll be s battle on the pitch &amp; anything can happen. There are no favourites. #RomaJuve
Wow Felipe Anderson is looking like the real deal &amp; not just a one hit wonder.

@DTenenbaum @Minarzouki @fabiobarto In general. He tends to take to take too long to make a decision resulting in a bad one/losing the ball
@ilajuve32 @Mimmo_25 Sono tutti forti al Real Madrid quindi per dire "riserva del Real" mi sembra un po ridicolo
@DTenenbaum @Minarzouki @fabiobarto Evra doesn't really seem good on the ball &amp; kind of cracks under pressure sometimes
@DTenenbaum @Minarzouki @fabiobarto Yeah he often plays at LB for Ghana. I gotta agree with Mina, he has all the credentials to play as a LB
@Enrico_Zambruno @Jtv231 Che foto
 #JuveBVB @Jtv231 
@Minarzouki @fabiobarto @DTenenbaum He's played LB successfully for Ghana a few times actually most memorably in CAF two years ago

Llorente would have been of use today using his hold up play to start counter attacks but Morata gave a complete performance.
The return match in Dortmund is all to play for. A game that'll directly decide who will advance to the QFs &amp; Juve have a slight advantage.
@FutbolSergi Its part of being German haha
Peccato per il gol concesso ma #cipuostare ... Fino Alla Fine
Called it!
@pgullaci Marchisio will be pivotal stopping Dortmund counter attacks.
Really good that we're going into the break 2-1 up. #JuveDortmund
YAAAASSSSS
Can see us winning 2-1
TEEVVVVEEEEZZZ
@Being_Max Not starting this game though &amp; hasn't been that good since his return
I <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ JU
#Gundogan will be key for #Dortmund today. His return to their midfield after injury has generally been a big boost for them.
@UEFAcomPaoloM @ciroimmobile @juventusfc DEL PIERO!
Forza KING ARTURO 
If Vidal has a top match today then we'll win.
Dortmund will vary from a 4-2-3-1 &amp; a 4-2-2-2 with Aubameyang &amp; Immobile forming a front two. #JuveDortmund
So I presume Reus will play behind Immobile &amp; Aubameyang on the left but with both of them constantly interchanging. #JuveDortmund
Inmobile starting for Dortmund! #JuveDortmund
Wow this is a completely different line-up than what was predicted! #BvB #JuveDortmund
Pogba, Lichtsteiner &amp; Morata are all one yellow card away from a one-game suspension in the Champions League. #JuveDortmund #JuveNews

#Juventus probable XI vs #BvB: (4-3-1-2) Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Chiellini, Evra; Marchisio, Pirlo, Pogba; Vidal; Tevez, Morata
Juventus players are currently resting after having lunch &amp; will soon have a light training session. #JuveNews #JuveDortmund
Klopp was very confident in his press conference yesterday speaking highly about his. They'll come to play today. #JuveDortmund
The return of Gundogan for Dortmund has been very important &amp; I believe there will be a great midfield battle tomorrow. #JuveDortmund

Atalanta won't be dangerous on the counter, Denis &amp; Baselli aren't "counter attacking players".

How long until Atalanta crack?

@SnoopianH Get off twitter @hashim0307
Lets not over-react. There's still a lot left in this game &amp; Juve are capable of turning this game around. #JuveAtalanta
@IFDMascitti YES
Uh oh
Eventually this Atalanta wall will break. Keep on attacking.
Expecting a comfortable win!
Fino Alla Fine!
Calcio's economic crisis has just hit a new level with #Parma.
Padoin will be playing at LB, not De Ceglie. #JuveNews #JuveAtalanta
Yes Pogba will start but as soon as Juventus are in a good position (in the second half) he'll definitely make way for Sturaro.
Well done to Allegri stating that he doesn't believe in a "turnover". Makes everyone feel they're important &amp; key squad players.
Allegri did say in his press conference yesterday that Pogba will play so any media outlets reporting Sturaro will start is unlikely. #Juve
Everything Parma President Manenti says, the complete opposite happens.
Mazzarri: «Juventus di Conte? Due scudetti merito mio» 
Goal in PL: "BALOTELLI HAS FINALLY SCORED IN THE PL!" and got stick for not celebrating
Goal in EL: Balo shouldn't score PK in that manner!
Goal in CL: Balotelli scores first goal for Liverpool!
Goal in COC: Balotelli finally scores after over a month! 
1/2
It looks like every time #Balotelli has scored for Liverpool it always created some controversy/news.
I'm actually surprised he's never tried taking the ball from Gerrard. #Balotelli #PTs
I was gonna say, it was starting to get a little strange that #Balotelli hasn't done that yet. As we've seen before hes always done it. #PRT
#Roma are in a very bad moment right now that has never happened under Garcia.

If Suarez doesn't work out at Barça then the "Barça can't play with a striker" will practically be confirmed.

Eto'o will get his first start for Sampdoria today! #SerieA
#Niang looks like he can go on and make a real impact at Genoa. Would look quite bad on Milan tbh.
This time he got it right, not once but twice. #Guarin...
#Guarin always tries shots from distance and they usually go sky high or just miss the target resulting in Inter faithful whistling him.
#Guarin was all over the place for Inter today; won the penalty, scored two marvellous goals &amp; assisted Palacio's goal. #AtalantaInter
Pulled big in #fantacalcio this week; Vazquez, Dybala, Candreva, Perotti &amp; still have Vidal, Lichtsteiner &amp; Buffon to count on.
Candreva chips the keeper on PK againnnnn  
Se vinciamo stasera andiamo a +9 #GrazieRoma
FT: Roma 0-0 Parma
This is why Napoli were never really capable of challenging for the title alongside Juventus &amp; Roma.
#Gabbiadini has scored his third goal for #Napoli in his last three games.
@Calciodiction I think it's Benitez tbh b/c under Mazzarri they had inferior defenders and didn't have as many problems as now
Tare reinforced the the squad &amp; Pioli's done well to integrate those players &amp; get results. They would deserve third place. #Lazio
Despite being one of the most shadiest men in calcio, Lotito made a good decision appointing Pioli who has done quite well so far.
Looks like my bet of getting Dybala &amp; Vazquez for my #fantacalcio team paid off.
Dybala-Vazquez is statistically the best attack partnership is Serie A I think.
Too many tats Ibra

Palermo President Maurizio Zamparini is in London to possibly be negotiating with a few of the clubs interested in #Dybala. (via CM)
Happy that Barzagli is back from injury but the only thing is he'll probably take Bonucci's spot who has been great this season.
What's with all these players getting high numbers on their jerseys? Most have to do with the last two-digits the player was born in.

RM have the option to re-buy #Morata in 2016 &amp; 2017 for €30M. However any club can pay his €80M release clause, to be split €40M/each.
Ferrero will be making a film about Samuel Eto'o... This keeps getting better and better.
I don't think people understand that Palermo will be happy to sell Dybala to any club as long as they pay their asking price which is €40M.
Osvaldo: "Da 20 giorni mi alleno da solo, spero vada tutto bene, è un sogno per chi seguiva Boca da tifoso come me."

Defrel: "E' importante che non ci sia Tevez; è un grande attaccante, segna sempre."
@OliPriceBates Just because he signed a contract extension doesn't mean he'll be staying
Talk about Buffon's successors in todays Tuttosport. Personally believe Gigi will go on to play in the 2018 World Cup &amp; retire after it.
@Hernan1897 @juvefcdotcom Yes but only for €40M ;) That's the catch

Goodnight <MEDIUM WHITE CIRCLE>️<MEDIUM BLACK CIRCLE>️ 
I don't think they would drastically lower their claims so what Serie A team could really afford him...?
In fact it reports that Martinez will leave this Summer. Porto wanted €40M two years ago when Napoli tried signing him.
Reports coming from Portugal linking Jackson Martinez with a move away Porto &amp; recently his agent stated how JM wants to play in Serie A.
@ADP1113 What exactly does he mean by didactic?
#Icardi met up with #Inter fans after the Palermo game yesterday &amp; they essentially "made up" after what happened after the Sassuolo game.


What's this I hear about Man U players who filmed a player having sexual relations with a women in the bathroom of a Manchester nightclub!?
Big win for #Genoa who bounce back from a recent run of poor results. #SerieA
Keita for Mauri; that's a good change, he'll had pace &amp; urgency go Lazio's attack as they search for a goal in the final 10 minutes.

Maybe Galliani is creating a scene on purpose to get people talking about that instead of how much better Juve is compared to Milan.

Everton need to utilize Lukaku a bit more.
HT: Everton 0-0 Liverpool #EFCLFC
@SerieAFFC I think despite his mistakes, Mandorlini really values his experience &amp; how he can "lead" the backline.
Everton-Liverpool has a real buzz to it. A real derby buzz.
@Calciodiction City should stay with him until the end of the season &amp; give the new manager a fresh start from the Summer.
@Calciodiction Yeah he's more of a manager who can bring 7-8th place team to a 3rd-4th place finish rather than dominating with a top club.
@Calciodiction Sometimes he gets the best out of team while other times not &amp; team looks lost. Where's the consistency a top club needs?
Liverpool are way too stretched. Need to stay a little bit more compact to reduce risk of giving the ball away &amp; Everton countering. #LFCEFC
@Calciodiction Pellegrini needs to go. Never saw him as a manager who could bring a top team to the top and never will.

We could replace Llorente with Dzeko next year. Could see him going to Inter too solely because of Mancini.

Santon was officially unveiled today - 
@PremiumCalcio Che centrocampo mediocre ...
Based on what formation we play Allegri will decide who to play alongside Tevez. My guess is if we play a 3-5-2 he'll prefer Llorente.
Allegri said in his press conference today that he will decide tomorrow on what formation to play vs Milan.
Allegri: " ... in Europa, ne ha le qualità, per questo è tutt’altro che una partita facile."
Allegri: "Galliani ha svolto un ottimo mercato, riportando 4 nazionali, Antonelli, Destro, Cerci e Paletta. Può lottare per un posto ..."

for them they need to stick by him no matter what. Despite the poor results recently, Garcia will get them out of it. No doubt.
I never thought Roma would come to the point where there is speculation about Garica getting sacked. Nevertheless, he's done so much
@1897j Eh certo!! Questo è ovvio!!
@1897j Sarebbe stato meglio se abbiamo preso lui invece di Tevez (solo per l'eta) però dovevamo mettere €40M sul piatto...
But it has to be said, the team that Mancini puts on the pitch is never balanced and doesn't produce what the team needs.
Mancini = OVERRATED
Higuain ! <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>

@D_Rimmer I feel it'll be a struggle &amp; it would be strange that all of a sudden they start playing good against a top club
@D_Rimmer Tied points with Arsenal in 2nd, were still good however, but surely they would be better in the Bundesliga by now!
Is BvB REALLY going to be that difficult for Juve? They're having a tragic season in the Bundesliga &amp; aren't showing signs of improvement.

I'm surprised Roma were more comfortable to sign Doumbia permanently rather than Ibarbo who has experience in Serie A &amp; proved himself.
Roma signed Argentian centre-back Spolli (31) from Serie B side Catania on a loan for €1M with option to buy for €1.5M.
What a waste of time Zaha's move to Manchester United was. Absolute waste of time. Man U should feel embarrassed really.

I love #Matri so I'm personally really happy he's back. I know some Juventini are disappointed but as a 4/5 option, he's not bad at all.
Pirlo is definitely happy Matri's coming back. They're really good friends, Pirlo also mentioned him in his book. 
Sorry, Eto'o attended the morning session but not the afternoon session.
Of course this did not go well with Mihaijlovic who got very upset. The situation will be taken up with the Ferrero. #Etoo
Mihaijlovic had scheduled a double training session today but Eto'o did not attend because he had to be in Milano for something.

@No1_Juve_Fan True
@CalcioTreeFC Who? Paletta, Galliani or Donadoni! Hahahahha
Allegri coached Matri under Cagliari and under Milan. Matri has scored 20 goals in 80 games (4,632') under Allegri. 
My guess is that the decision to sign either Matri or Osvaldo was down to Allegri who chose Matri since they both know each other well.
@No1_Juve_Fan La Chiabotto isn't with us anymore... <CONFUSED FACE>
Makes sense because after or before the game Galliani would have been able to negotiate with Parma.
Looks like Paletta will not sign for Samp but for Milan! Galliani stated pre-Parma they'll sign a defender &amp; Donadoni assured he'll leave.
The first time we signed Matri it was also in January. But at that time he was coming to try and save our club not as a 4/5 striking option.

Del Bosque has called Morata to the NT! 
Top interview from Falcao's first ever agent &amp; current mentor about all things Falcao - 
@Mr__Freak We could make do without Pogba though, especially against Monaco.
@Mr__Freak Some great news to wake up to that's for sure!! But we must not underestimate them, they are in the QFs for a reason
MONACO!!!!!
On the weekend they face Sampdoria, another tough tough side to play against. This game is a big test for Inter.
Has Mancini really had any impact with Inter so far? Some games they look like they're improving &amp; others they look like they're hopeless.
@Marcocalcio22 He said it referring to signing the players at the wrong time (no immediate impact) &amp; not disputing their quality
Sabatini: "Dimettersi oggi sarebbe una fuga e non sono abituato a scappare. Ma dovrò pensare a quello fatto, nei prossimi mesi."
And the only time he does gets injured it's for 50 DAYS <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
This is the first time Pogba has every been sidelined for a long time because of injury. As of now he has never missed a game due to injury.

Lesson learned by Rudi Garcia: never open your mouth &amp; say stupid things unless you are certain b/c it'll come back to bite you in the ass
@K_Khatib93 @Marcocalcio22 Yes that's why you need to be smart &amp; make the right judgement if it's worth over spending or not
@K_Khatib93 @Marcocalcio22 Exactly. But the clubs try to get as much as possible b/c the player wants to leave &amp; so price gets inflated
@Being_Max How come?
@Calciodiction AIIIIII <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
