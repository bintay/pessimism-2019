@AlexBrill_DC @PolitiBunny @WSJ It was part of the nuclear deal Obama did with Iran.
@Govt4theP @ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah Bush, Obama, the Fed, other dodgy central banks, Rodney King,
@Govt4theP @ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah GFC seemed to have a lot of contributing factors. I don't blame the bankers exclusively nor deregulation
@Govt4theP @ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah I don't know, why don't you ask the architect of that reality, address your letter to B Obama White House
@Govt4theP @ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah So how is paying more tax going to help people pay bills?
@Govt4theP @ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah So people on welfare are supporting rich people
@Govt4theP @ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah If a person was actually poor, they wouldn't be able to support anyone
@ShaunNewman2 @Qldaah Why not give the government all the money in the whole country? We could be Soviet Australia.
@thegothking @RichardDawkins Dude! 2 + 2 = 4??!! That's racist.
@DanWosHere @Fitzy @AndrewMattock @JulianBurnside @morgancroberts @Prufrockery Guys calm down, it's all okay, this is multiculturalism.
@CarlGWoodward Ha ha, yeah it is a bit of stretch.
@CarlGWoodward Reagan was a socialist in some ways, he expanded government particularly the military. He rallied against welfare but kept it
@henryjackp @CarlGWoodward This of course is a valid point. If Germany attacked Russia unencumbered, Russia would have been annihilated
@CarlGWoodward @keithvlasak Actually that started before the war.
@CarlGWoodward @keithvlasak Nazis, large centrally planned government, redistribution of resources, government owned the means of production
@peterwhill1 @Fitzy @TonyAbbottMHR The Liberals won't stand up for the infidels. Labor is way more Islam friendly. The Greens 1000x more so.
@CarlGWoodward @keithvlasak Even though became bitter enemies, both the Soviets and Nazis were socialist. Excuse me for stating the obvious.
@henryjackp @CarlGWoodward The Russians sure did a lot of the heavy lifting in WWII.
@PolitiBunny So this is what you Americans have come to? If a black person is shot by cop, other black people can do what they like. WTF?
@con_agius Sorry, that was unintentional. So are you saying Africans should fix Africa or that Africans shouldn't fix Africa?
@keithvlasak why do you Americans keep using the word liberal, what they really are is socialists. Just like communists &amp; Nazis - socialists
@keithvlasak weren't the original thugs Indians?
@Mark_J_Perry Not many people know this but Pat Riarchy is a guy with a Japanese dad and an Irish mum, Pat is always into mischief.
@bigrivertribe @KieraGorden @kevinandrewsmp @PPantsdown Why not, it's accurate. A new leader doesn't change the parties policies.
@con_agius Okay fair enough, It's a bit of a bummer, I would love to have heard your argument as to why Africans shouldn't fix Africa.
@con_agius Hi Connie, you said not over Twitter, I was wondering why you don't want to discuss Africans fixing Africa. Seems fine to me?
@Sargon_of_Akkad Two SJWs walk into a bar. The bartender asks them "what's your poison?" Both SJWs answer simultaneously "Facts".
@CareyRMoore @Qldaah His comment is equally relevant to the Liberal &amp; Labor parties. He's parroting party script, but still people heard him
@CareyRMoore @Qldaah Is all caps supposed to be a signal you are being ironic.
@MichaelByrnes @GarthGodsman is this the missing 11th commandment
@CareyRMoore @Qldaah He is a federal minister, his opinion has gravitas of some magnitude. What you mean is "I don't like his opinion".
@mattholehouse @GarthGodsman UK you are doomed. How many wake up calls do you need? Close your fricking borders, at least temporarily
@RitaPanahi @GarthGodsman Bad news for me, I had $50 on Feiz Mohammad becoming the next Greens Party leader
@con_agius Please explain?
@shanebazzi @kevinandrewsmp @Greens stance on gay marriage doesn't give them a pass on their eagerness to tax families into oblivion
@kevinandrewsmp @Greens The Greens are also bad for the environment because they replaced their anarcho capitalist frame with socialism.
Conservatives: We are not afraid! Free speech!
Liberals: Geller should apologize for upsâ€¦
@GarthGodsman @con_agius Since when has Eritrea and Syria not been in Africa? Africans need to fix Africa not run away.
@PolitiBunny How is the US going to overcome socialism? There is too many people voting for welfare. Hilary is up next too. Not good.
@phlim1942 @roamingaussie The Greens are no longer Greens, they are now the Immigration Socialist Party.
@mcmoynihan @mic @MarcieBianco Racist isn't the worse thing you can be called! What about pedophile, rapist, feminist, necrophiliac?
@landeryou SHY reacts to the news no boats full of asylum seekers came last month. Soldier on their comrade (yeah I meant the "their")
@niallscamren @VHSCALUM @PolitiBunny Feminism isn't about freedom from inequality, Feminism is about freedom from consequences.
#Budget2015 #auspol So you wanna fix the budget? Well, make all welfare a loan... Easy - all fixed. Waiting for consultancy fee.............
@frank8427zz9za @GarthGodsman The ABC charter, promote socialism, professional sport, multiculturalism, blasphemy laws, feminism, #notmyabc
@PolitiBunny I protected my daughter from feminism, I taught her to respect the truth and the ability to reason.
@VHSCALUM @PolitiBunny @niallscamren Third wave feminists are fighting for women who are oppressed in the developing world, ha ha ha ha ha!!
@SkyNewsAust A government that is broke shouldn't be giving money away to anyone.
@Kon__K we should spend some of our federal surplus on aboriginal aid.
@Qldaah @7NewsBrisbane shame they didn't feel the same way about cars with faulty oil rings blowing half burnt oil down everyone's throats
@GarthGodsman and he made Christopher Pyne education minister
@keithvlasak @Fitzy no it's racist misogyny
@mattstat @GarthGodsman thirty years ago the said global warming would cause catastrophic climate conditions in thirty years... hmmm
@GarthGodsman Tony Abbott is left wing, he seems pretty keen on expanding government
@GuidoFawkes @GarthGodsman Labor fighting for workers rights <FLUSHED FACE>
@GarthGodsman I don't hate Abbott, I just think he is a hopeless leader just like Shorten.
@BevanShields What a strange animal this Abbott is. What a nobody of a PM. Nothing to offer, no plan, no passion, no principles, a worm.
@robcalling @VelourBeanbag yeah I know it's seems weird at first. Welfare makes poverty, drug prohibition creates crime. Both sides support.
@SharriMarkson @robcalling Fairfax will probably blame global warming
@robcalling @VelourBeanbag government collects revenue from drug prohibition by taxing the middle class in the name of fighting crime
@Ellysa_Maye @GarthGodsman they were infidels
@VelourBeanbag @robcalling the war on drugs is a scam used by the government to fleece tax payers
@FroudeyBrand this is the first tweet explaining the actual situation. Nobody else seems to realise the government is absolutely broke.
#SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA why is there only one point of view under this hashtag?
@smh #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA #SOSBLCKAUSTRALIA what human rights are being infringed?
#SOSBLCKAUSTRALIA  This is not an echo chamber (unlike #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA), say what you like
@ya64yi #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA yeah it's not like they have anything else to do.
@robcalling @MiraWroblewski I don't think these people care about the people stuck in these camps.
@MiraWroblewski people with grasp of the situation should be commenting. The camps perpetuate poverty, that is the other side of this issue
@MiraWroblewski no I am new to the Twitter world. It's actually a bit confusing
@MiraWroblewski #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA at last, a comment from millionaire celebrity who has only seen an aboriginal camp from 30 000 feet
@rachandlaura_xx #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA what? Gulags are full of poverty and violence, so you want more gulags?
@Diddoms #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA actually we can't afford all three
@Swampyagain @SenatorSiewert #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA look up the word deficit. Warning you may be confronted with reality
Where are you going to get photovoltaic cells from, you closed the mines remember
@rachandlaura_xx I have actually been to a couple of these ghettos that you think are so fantastic, hell on Earth seems an apt description
@DonnelleHall yes I am sure you would love having no electricity
@Rebelleyus @sosblakaust this makes no sense #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA
@SaysSarita yeah like a bowel movement #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA
@Dan_Gerr yeah it's shocking, the other day I was ethnic cleansed at Nandos #SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA
@loosewayneson what about us Asians? It seems unfair to not include us, we work to you know.
#SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA This protest is nonsensical, why perpetuate an unsustainable culture with no bearing on culture portrayed by said protest
This protest is nonsensical, why perpetuate an unsustainable culture which has no bearing on culture portrayed by said protest?
