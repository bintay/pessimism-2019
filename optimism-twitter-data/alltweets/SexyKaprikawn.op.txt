I've drifted away from people I thought I'd be close to forever.
Because if you do, you're no longer you. You're someone everyone else wants you to be.
Don't let the judgement of others stop you from being you.
You can't go through life worried about what everyone else is going to think.
If you don't step forward, you will always be in the same place.
No one has the right to take someone's happiness away.
Sometimes you just gotta leave people to do the stupid things they do. <CONFUSED FACE>

How to help the relief effort: 
I smile at strangers, they always smile back at me.
Realize that they are not faults, not imperfections. They make you, You. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
