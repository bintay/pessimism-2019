&gt; keeping tabs on what the Mikaelsons were doing in their spare time or with their realty books. Would he even care? I couldn’t &gt;
&gt; he has yet to rent that place out—“ If he even bothered, maybe he’d even sold it. I’d been dead awhile and hadn’t really been &gt;
&gt; lengthy consideration. “Klaus’s place,” I elaborated, the name tasting bitter upon my lips. “He left and as far as I’m aware, &gt;
&gt; what Klaus did to Tyler? I felt guilty for even considering it. 

“What of your brother’s place?” I suggested after a &gt;
&gt; lived together and that were both equally busy. But could I really throw another Mikaelson into their lap? Especially after &gt;
&gt; practically living there and Damon in the dog box. The Lockwood’s? I knew Matt inherited the place. That he and Tyler now &gt;
&gt; idea of imposing on the Salvatores. No, definitely not them. That was decided, especially with them being awol, Elena &gt;
&gt; possibly, the candles.” 

I thought on the space, not wanting to familiarize the woman with my home, briefly considering the &gt;
&gt; lagged behind her, making sure to keep a steady pace with the both of them. “I have most these things at home, expect for, &gt;
&gt; candles — green, red, yellow, blue. And coffee, copious amounts. Can you get me those things?"

“Sure,” I replied as I &gt;
&gt; walking away from us, leading us back toward the car.

"I need cinnamon, lavender, wormwood, sticks of chalk, athame, four &gt;
&gt; "I will need a place to perform the spell, preferably inside where I will not be disturbed — by anyone,” Freya said, &gt;
&gt; car—though we knew the way—was still quite a distance, which left us little time to make it to the store before it closed at 5. &gt;
&gt; statement, refraining from correcting him on the timeframe in which we’d manage to accomplish it. Walking back to the &gt;
&gt; think in your case here time’s the factor, so let’s not waste it where we can help it.”

I nodded, mutely supporting his &gt;
&gt; what you need, give us the names, and Bonnie’ll write them down – we’ll get it all in the town’s store within half an hour. I &gt;
&gt; added, hardly entertaining the idea of scourging through dirt and dried leaves for anything useful. 

“If you know exactly &gt;

&gt; waiting for him to catch on and focus, recalling how cold it had gotten and those colorful lights that shone overhead. “We &gt;
&gt; your magic again. What do we do? This only solves part of the problem. I don’t know what happened out there—“ I continued, &gt;
&gt; of the yard yet,” I remarked, strolling over to the couch I’d claimed earlier to retrieve my cold tea.

“Now that I have of &gt;
&gt; which, were set down next to him.

&gt; Salvatore library. I’d spent enough time in there to know there were a few at home remedy books available.

I returned to &gt;
&gt; “I’ll check in on you in a few minutes.” I registered the strain on his face as I walked from the parlor and headed for the &gt;
&gt; myself.”

“Try and rest a little while longer,” I said with an exasperated exhale, sparing no mind to his unwitting sarcasm. &gt;
&gt; finish me off right away in a simpler and more certain manner… By the way, where’s that knife? Give it to me. I’ll do it &gt;
&gt; kill him. I was trying to make sure he wouldn’t – not again. 

“Of course I don’t know my blood type. You might as well &gt;
&gt; needles.”

Was he high on his post stab endorphins or did he not understand the concept of a transfusion? I wasn’t trying to &gt;
&gt; which would probably be a merciful end compared to what you’re gonna do to me when you get your hands on blood packs and &gt;
&gt; “You’re literally killing me. I mean, I should probably allow it just to see how you go about it so I could die of laughter – &gt;
&gt; my brows incredulously, trying to figure out what he found so funny, unable to stave my irritation at his amusement. &gt;
&gt; “Oh, Bonnie, really? Transfusion? Sure, why the hell not. Mere stab was too boring. Gee, you’re killing me.”

&gt; its availability. Is there anything special you need? Anything you won’t find in the nearest shrub?” I asked with a leisurely &gt;
&gt; how soon you want to get it done,” I replied. “We… or well, I… usually get whatever I need from town or online, depending on &gt;
&gt; had. 

"How do you procure such supplies in this town? Are there shops, or will I have to scour the forests?"

“Depends on &gt;
&gt; shall have to gather the necessary ingredients first,” she said at long last, having looked as skeptical about the idea as I &gt;
&gt; still wanted to be here, to witness it and keep an eye on things at all times – at least as much as I could.

"Alright. I &gt;
&gt; try the simpler way while Bonnie researches her ancestor.”

That sounded good to my ears, something I would gladly do. But I &gt;
&gt; on par with who these people were.

“So, before we make ourselves crazy about recreating the spell and potion, I suggest you &gt;
&gt; 

I silently bit my tongue, wanting to voice that he clearly hadn’t meant Esther and that as much as he’d read – he wasn’t &gt;
&gt; or in my case: possessive.

“If you summon her and ask, she won’t be able to deny you – you’re her blood, and she owes you." &gt;
&gt; vulnerable to them and that talking to them even gave them leverage enough to insert themselves in your life, be it physical &gt;
&gt; experienced enough connections with dead people to know we shouldn’t toy with nature like that. That you made yourself &gt;
&gt; can still tell you where it is if she’s dead.”

Oh, no… I didn’t like where this suggestion was going. I’d been an anchor, &gt;
&gt; years. Also vampires happened to be a walking talking example.

“And even if there was nothing in her memories about it, she &gt;
&gt; you both realize it.”

I agreed with that sentiment, having witnessed said evidence of his statement multiple times over the &gt;

&gt; type?”]] @KaiJest #SurpriseParty
&gt; some rest and I’ll be back in fifteen,” I moved around the couch, pausing briefly. “I don’t suppose you know your blood &gt;
&gt; fourth time around had lost its appeal. I guess that’s what happens when human interaction is at a minimum. “And try to get &gt;
&gt; “In fact… yes, I think I will. You eat something,” I said, surprised that the idea of seeing him dead a third and &gt;
&gt; back, tossing the plastic paperish thermometer toward the medical aid kit. I wasn’t even sure if it was in dangerous levels. &gt;
&gt; once an alarming number revealed itself on the black band. ”You might need a transfusion.”

I released him, taking a slow step &gt;
&gt; so he didn’t try to pull himself free and give me a premature read.

“Maybe I should make a run to the hospital,” I stated &gt;
&gt; go into cardiac arrest or his temperature to drop any lower. I ignored his look of confusion, tightening my hold on his head &gt;
&gt; taking his head into my hands without question, lightly pressing the slither of plastic to his forehead. I didn’t want him to &gt;
&gt; holding that accusing edge it did before, merely stating fact. I removed the press on thermometer and stepped in front of him, &gt;
&gt; I’m ready to give up my life and let the poor odds decide it. Funny.”

“That’s the way of Karma,” I said, my voice no longer &gt;
&gt; quit it for good upon having discovered I couldn’t get out of here… and it all comes to this. I can only get out of here if &gt;
&gt; bedroom.

“If I know what irony is – it’s the headline of my fate. So much work to get out of here, so many tries to just &gt;
&gt; wildly it makes me wanna puke.”

I set my mug aside, unfolded my legs and walked over to the medical kit I stored in my &gt;
&gt; great with the sealing the wound, I still have the blood loss to deal with. And all that comes with, like my head spinning so &gt;
&gt; understand how drastic a measure that truly was and that in spite of his success, I didn’t support it.

“Though you did &gt;

&gt; too bad, pale beyond belief but his cheeks possessed a small tinge of color. I supposed that was a good sign. 

“How are you &gt;
&gt; sure I would be able to do much more if you go anemic or something.”

I sat back and stared at him a moment. He didn’t look &gt;
&gt; crue t-shirt. I sipped at my tea. 

“There is some juice next to you and a ham sandwich. I suggest you finish both. I’m not &gt;
&gt; got lucky,” I responded, sliding onto the chair opposite him curling my legs beneath me, adorning in a freshly chosen motley &gt;
&gt; two hands closed around a mug of warm tea. I was done drinking. At least for now.

“Despite how sucky the method.”

&gt; for the downstairs bathroom to rinse my hands, to get him a glass of orange juice to help get his glucose back up and tend to the &gt;
&gt; minute, hoping my attempt at rescuing him didn’t diminish the sacrifice he’d made.

I pushed off the carpeted floor, heading &gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, it did nothing for his consciousness. I expelled a sigh as I sat back on my haunches, studying my hands for a &gt;
&gt; away with the evidence that he might have carelessly taken a knife to his abdomen or that he was close to being anemic. &gt;
&gt; all those years ago. I ignored the nauseating sensation as it shot through me and marveled as his would skinned over, doing &gt;
&gt; over and over as I concentrated on slowing down the rapid blood flow, drawing of his pain into myself as I’d done for Elena &gt;
&gt; quickly removing my own in order to press the cotton material to his wound. 

“Obsecro te reddere spiritus sui,” I repeated &gt;
&gt; down onto the couch before he could pass out on me. 

I ripped the bottom of his shirt to clear my bloodied workspace, &gt;
&gt; ashen and scrunched with pain. I jerked my hands from his, grabbing the front of his shirt and his shoulder and forced him &gt;
&gt; encouraged high. I opened my eyes as his hands became slack and his body swayed precariously away from me. His face looked &gt;
&gt; chanted. It wasn’t long before the concentrated warmth flooded my body and introduced me to the familiarity of a magically &gt;
&gt; most ridiculous plan,” I added for extra measure, gripping his slippery fingers, my eyes too closing once more while he &gt;
&gt; sacrifice, my head reeling to try and remember the healing spells I’d taught myself sometime before.

“This is by far your &gt;
&gt; him in the nose and apply pressure to the wound. 

“Take my hands.” I hesitated for a second, deciding not to waste his &gt;
&gt; gritted out in a panic as the knife clattered to the floor. 

I crossed the space once more, wanting to simultaneously punch &gt;
&gt; out.” 

“There is—“ I cut in once more, my eyes widening as he suddenly stabbed himself in the side. “Are you crazy?!” I &gt;
&gt; “My body won’t give it up unless we make it. Understand now? And no, I don’t know for sure, and there’s only one way to find &gt;
&gt; set my empty glass back down on the table, the words hardly heard as he continued to explain what he thought was the issue. &gt;
&gt; strength, I presume it only worked yesterday because I was weakened enough to let it happen.”

“Or maybe—“ I chipped in as I &gt;
&gt; learned to give it back, and didn’t think I was able to at all. And now that it doesn’t work in the slightest when I’m in my &gt;
&gt; obvious. But wasn’t his power changed now? Maybe he didn’t know how to activate it properly with the blockage?

 “I’ve never &gt;
&gt; it. I wouldn’t do it. I refused.

“My ability to consume other witches’ powers is not a sharing one.” That was certainly &gt;
&gt; We’d spent all of ten minutes on working on a solution and the best we could come up with was internal bleeding? I didn’t like &gt;
&gt; is nothing logical about this,” I mumbled into the liquid I was swiftly downing, shaking my head as he picked up the knife. &gt;
&gt; Do the math. It’s the only logical thing to assume right now when other variants I could think of have failed us.” 

“There &gt;
&gt; enough,” he bartered, his bloodied hand extended toward me for evidence. 

“And when I came here yesterday, dying, it worked. &gt;
#SurpriseParty @KaiJest -- [[“This was out less-damaging option. It could have worked – it almost, almost did – but it wasn’t &gt;
&gt; and non-manic explanation while simultaneously grappling for a solution myself.]] @KaiJest #SurpriseParty
&gt; from behind my back to pick up my glass. I took a large sip, peering at him over the rim of the glass, waiting for a logical &gt;
&gt; can try.” 

I took another determined step back and then put distance between us as I headed for my drink, moving my hand &gt;
&gt; seeking myself. “Maybe we should try the less manic approach. There must be another… safer and less body damaging option we &gt;
&gt; I made no move to take the knife.

 “And what will that accomplish exactly?” I asked, unable to see the pattern he was &gt;
&gt; we have to try it. Unless you have a magic wand up your sleeve.”

As much as I wanted to go home, to get out of this place, &gt;
&gt; that I did now, not completely. I hardly knew him. 

“Stab me somewhere I might survive if it’ll make you feel better, but &gt;
&gt; socio tendencies in the beginning—when we first met—that had been the thing to put me off. I couldn’t trust him then – not &gt;
&gt; some of a day but if I was being truly honest with myself, he wasn’t half as bad in the conversational department. It was his &gt;
&gt; damn knife before I change my mind because this crazy idea is all I got.”

I’d only spent half a night in Kai’s company and &gt;
#SurpriseParty @KaiJest -- [[“Do you wanna stay here forever? With me? Or you’re willing to fight for your freedom? Take the &gt;
&gt; again? This place is unstable! What if you don’t come back?”]] @KaiJest #SurpriseParty
&gt; tremor that raced through me.

“How can you be sure that would even work? And what if it doesn’t work and you simply die &gt;
&gt; was quite another stabbing him for the sake of doing so. I unfurled my hand, sliding my hand behind my back to still the &gt;
&gt; belief, I wasn’t the blood lusting type. It was one thing killing Kai because I believed him a family murdering psycho, but it &gt;
&gt; dumbly, scowling at the mere thought of his insinuation. 

“No,” I responded, taking an involuntary step back. Contrary to &gt;
&gt; faster than my own and headed in a direction I wasn’t prepared for. 

“You’ll have to stab me.”

“What?” I parroted &gt;
&gt; to recreate the first time.”

The first time? The first time of what? Now I was confused, his brain obviously working miles &gt;
&gt; account to all the bullshit I had to deal with in the beginning.

“Normal way doesn’t seem to work well enough, so we have &gt;
&gt; done that before?” 

I opened my mouth to tell him I was okay, that it was one of the few things I’d taught myself on &gt;
&gt; to be working overtime trying to get to the answer. 

“How are you with healing spells? Mending cut wounds with magic? Ever &gt;
&gt; yet to feel anything, nothing I could distinguish as I would I had my power other than minuscule warmth. 

His brain seemed &gt;
&gt; from me to you and it’s too fucking narrow. 

There’s gotta be a way to widen it…” he said allowed. I on the other hand had &gt;
&gt; and cradled it against my chest, curling my fingers into my bleeding palm, nursing the wound.

“It’s like there’s a tube going &gt;
&gt; push my energy in a certain direction and feeling utterly useless. 

He broke out connection once more. I withdrew my hand &gt;
#SurpriseParty @KaiJest -- [[I closed my eyes once he took my hands again, focusing on taking the power from him, of trying to &gt;
&gt; bloodied fingers, waiting for him to take and do as he’d planned.]] @KaiJest #SurpriseParty
&gt; extending the knife toward him, handle first as my parents taught me. 
“Back to holding my hand?” I asked, unfurling my &gt;
&gt; gritting my teeth as I did. 

“Doing that never gets any easier,” I commented, hesitating if only for a second before &gt;
&gt; showcase I’d found it. I changed hands upon my approach and raised the knife to my right palm, slicing into it with fluidity, &gt;
&gt; kitchen sink the day before.

I returned to the parlor, strolling toward him this time, brandishing the knife slightly to &gt;
&gt; the kitchen, forgoing the cutlery outside the window and retrieved the butcher’s knife I’d hidden in a bucket beneath the &gt;
&gt; mood for spoons.”

“I don’t need to think, I know where they are. Wait here. I won’t be a sec,” I responded. I jogged toward &gt;
&gt; “Blood sharing might help. We need a knife. Think you can remember where you buried them? Because this time I’m surely in no &gt;

“What’s option two?”]] @KaiJest #SurpriseParty
&gt; “Motus,” I said half-heartedly and then extended a hand, repeating the word in hopes of sending it careening into the nearby &gt;
&gt; smile. “That’s about it.” To be safe, however, I turned to regard the lamp poised upon the table next to the couch. &gt;
&gt; the connection a few minutes later. “Feel anything?”

“Your hands are a bit clammy,” I indicated, offering him a feeble &gt;
&gt; murmured as he started to chant, his voice growing to a fallible crescendo that soon droned in my head repeatedly. 

He broke &gt;
&gt; hands, closing my eyes to help—although powerless—hopeful I could help push things along. 

“Essentia magus mea delego…” he &gt;
#SurpriseParty @KaiJest -- [[“Okay, let’s start with simple ways.” I took a small step back as he got up and then took his &gt;
&gt; I said, ignoring my drink and the weariness worming their way into my psyche. “Where do you want me?”]] @KaiJest #SurpriseParty
&gt; the power transfer. It’s a little past two, we’ve got time to practice. Maybe we won’t blow it tomorrow, then.”

“Alright,” &gt;
&gt; means to destroy in case something didn’t go according to plan. At least most the time.

“What we CAN do is try to master &gt;
&gt; things? Or another note on how to escape this place. What I knew of magic, if there was a means to create, there was a lot a &gt;
&gt; considered what he said about my grandmother and her possible journals. Maybe she documented what we might need to correct &gt;
&gt; across from me, trying to tend to another option and to keep from throwing something. I was quick to anger lately. I even &gt;
&gt; blocking my use of it. There’s a difference.”

 I grimaced and focused my attention on the painting hanging on the wall &gt;
#SurpriseParty @KaiJest -- [[“It’s not stuck between the worlds, Bonnie. It’s all in here, in me, I feel it. This world is &gt;
&gt; anything relating to what I’ve seen. There might be something there to help.”]] @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest #DevilsContract
&gt; stated. 

“I’ll have to take a closer look at my grandmother’s old books, her grimoire and see if I can find &gt;
&gt; told. That she used to be a dear old friend of your mother’s and that she was one of the most powerful witch's in history,” I &gt;
&gt; I assumed it was Latin. I was way in over my head here.

"Do you know anything of Ayana's origins?"

“Only what I’ve been &gt;
&gt; recognize the language?"

I unhelpfully shook my head, not able to make heads or tails of anything either woman had spoken. &gt;
&gt; and I believe I can copy down Esther's part of the incantation. Ayana's words, however...they are foreign to me? Either of you &gt;
&gt; weapon, or at least something like it. In time I will probably be able to make the necessary potion used to anoint the weapon, &gt;
&gt; quite as she’d hoped. Family trait.

"Our purpose here is to gather what information we can, so that we can recreate the &gt;
&gt; lips twitched into a small awkward smile, noticing the hurt, something I assume—like Rebekah—she had no way of disguising &gt;
&gt; use for it anymore. Dahlia had no further reason to seek them out, and since Esther thought me not worthy of saving–"

My &gt;
&gt; later memories, and I believe that once she made my father and siblings vampires, she simply forgot all about it. She had no &gt;
&gt; what it was protecting them from, it would at hand. I didn’t put anything past them anymore.

“I saw nothing of it again in &gt;
&gt; I could assure Freya that nothing that powerful was ever lost to that destructive family, if, they knew of its purpose and &gt;
&gt; "No. Ever since I first penetrated Esther's mind, I've been working with the assumption that the dagger is forever lost.” &gt;
&gt; wicked witch of yours, I’d guess – or Dahlia has it by now, given they haven’t succeeded and she’s still running rampant.” &gt;
&gt; Mikaelsons—pain, blood and destruction—as depicted by Esther.

“It might be wherever they tried to use it – against that &gt;
&gt; under a scorching supernatural lock with another ungodly creature attached to it. That was the only way to go with the &gt;
&gt; wouldn’t count on it still being around.” 

That was my thinking too and imagined it to be locked in the deepest crevasse &gt;

&gt; find a way to bring you and your new qualities all the way over, wouldn’t that stabilize the power you already have within you &gt;

&gt; to the fireplace and picked a candle holder off the mantel. “As you demonstrated yesterday, you have magic, it’s just not in &gt;
&gt; good,” I said, hoping to make him understand where I was coming from. “We need your magic to get out of here.” I walked over &gt;
&gt; Forgive my dullness, but I fail to see the point.”

“I’m not looking to reverse you. That wouldn’t do either of us any &gt;

”And then this splendor, becomes our tomb forever with all hope buried and rotten. &gt;
&gt; leave him depleted and magic less. He was right to wonder how that would serve me. I took a sip of my whiskey and set the &gt;
&gt; magic of your own, and if you reverse me – you got nothing left to cast the spell.” Ah, so that was it, he was afraid I’d &gt;
&gt; reality and came off as more of a useless tease.

“But even if it were – what exactly would we achieve with it? You have no &gt;
&gt; going to accumulate magic? Kai had it, it was already in his grasp so to say, it just wasn’t of any use to us in this &gt;
&gt; “I don’t think my change is reversible, no matter the methods.” Then how was he expecting to get us out of here? How were we &gt;
&gt; proposal and I could understand why. I too would be frightened if someone casually mentioned tethering me to this place. &gt;

&gt; be able to find with a simple locator spell either.” If Dahlia was as powerful as Freya and these two woman evidently feared, then it &gt;
&gt; that had been spoken and trying to make sense of it.

“And it’s purpose,” I added. “My guess is that’s not it’s something we’ll &gt;
&gt; we can confirm that there is a weapon,” I said as the image fell away, still reeling from what I’d seen, trying to recall the words &gt;
&gt; within the circle. Esther and Ayana. I took a step closer to get a better look as they started to converse. 

“At least now &gt;
&gt; command. An image sprung forth in full 3D, my eyes widening slightly with amazement, immediately recognizing the two woman &gt;
&gt; way she did. She took the small blade to her flesh, blood dripping to the ground in a notable pattern before she prompted a &gt;
&gt; this," Freya said appreciatively. I chuckled softly drawn from my dreary musings, not seeing the elusive item quite the same &gt;
&gt; one too. Still, I wasn’t naïve to what Kai—if in HIS right mind—would and could do with it.

"Oh, a very clever witch made &gt;
&gt; internally. I knew it to be useful in most instances and that one time or another my Boy Scout of a father insisted I carry &gt;
&gt; idea of him keeping any kind of concealed weapon on him. Not while I was in his company.

&gt; Falls. “I packed light and barely have need for one—“ I darted a look at Kai, interested as to whether or not he actually carried one &gt;
&gt; apologetic emphasis. I didn’t even have loose change. I’d hardly grabbed anything, not really planning on the trip back to Mystic &gt;

“No,” I answered, patting at my sides for &gt;

&gt; And I was determined to do so upon my return, upon settling back home and trying to find more antiquated ways to shield myself. I &gt;
&gt; the location—I meant the forest. I, on the other hand, didn’t. There was so much I still craved to learn, to express and indulge in. &gt;
&gt; others before her centuries ago—still used it to temper and harness her power. She appeared so at home—and I wasn’t just talking about &gt;
&gt; finding myself feeling somewhat jealous too. I’d only read about such ways of connecting to the earth and wondered briefly if she—like &gt;
&gt; around a bonfire when the moon is out." 

I arched an incredulous brow, amused at the look on his face and her utter seriousness, &gt;
&gt; on. “Impressive. Not as much as I’d like it to be, but… will do. Now what? We make a bonfire and start dancing?” 

"I only dance naked &gt;

&gt; on a fallen log, merely waiting for her to pass along an instruction on how to go about getting what she was looking for or to &gt;
&gt; that that’s where Elijah dropped Elena. I strolled away from the spot, not trusting the soil around it and found myself a place to sit &gt;
&gt; the spitefulness that arose in me and the memories attached to this place. I could see directly into the tunnels. I could only assume &gt;
&gt; around, reacquainting myself with the atea while Freya did her thing, my eyes drifting to the sizeable hole in the ground, driving away &gt;
&gt; and dust before pocketing it. All that running and hiking in 1994 had definitely aided in keeping me fit. I ventured a look &gt;
&gt; following my directives every so often. I breathed heavier once we arrived at the clearing, wiping my phone free of dirt &gt;
&gt; Freya added positively. Freya took the lead almost immediately, as if something were drawing her where she needed to go, &gt;
&gt; scrolling between where we should be, what should be seen and where we were headed. "Not to worry. We will find our way," &gt;
&gt; on a mobile screen,” Kai pointed out. “And with poor reception,” I mused aloud, eyeing the phones fluctuating signal bars, &gt;
&gt; question. I didn’t want to suffer being in the dark and facing more internal skepticism. “Maps can be deceiving. Especially &gt;
&gt; held. The earth will have witnessed what I need to see." “Okay,” I answered, glad Freya hadn’t hesitated to answer my &gt;

&gt; one way to get there and this wasn’t it. “This way. It looks about half an hour’s walk from here. I hope…“ I added, somewhat &gt;
&gt; navigating google maps to see how far off we were and how long it would take us to get us where we needed to be. I only knew &gt;
&gt; reminded of why I loathed the Mikaelsons. “Why? What are we looking for here?” I asked, taking my phone out, quickly &gt;
&gt; here. Do you know the site of their original home with Mikael and Esther?"

“I do actually,” I responded, once again &gt;
&gt; bag, smiling slightly as I did in response to her obvious joviality.  

"You said you knew my siblings when they were last &gt;
&gt; in time - not this far out of town anyway. I could hardly even tell where we were.

When Freya returned I handed over the &gt;
&gt; furtive look around. I may have grown up here, but I wasn’t as antiquated with the forest as I would have liked at this minute &gt;
&gt; much in there – nothing I could recognize as untoward anyway. I closed it back up, scuffed my heel against the dirt and cast a &gt;
&gt; assume he needed a break too. I peered in the direction she’d headed and opened her bag. I was surprised to find there wasn’t &gt;
&gt; purse? I have to urinate."

“Sure,” I said and darted a look at Kai. “You too?” He hadn’t gone in a while, I could only &gt;
&gt; after Freya as she led the way. I automatically closed my hand around the bag she’d all but forced into my arms.

"Hold my &gt;
&gt; meal upon the passenger seat. I closed the door, rounding the front of the car to meet up with the two and slowly trailed &gt;
&gt; and clueless people.”

I slipped my empty sandwich box onto the dashboard as we got out, setting Kai’s drink and untouched &gt;

&gt; explained as I moved to sit on the arm of one of the two couches in the middle of the room. “Perhaps we could do this the &gt;
&gt; to this prisoner world? To latch this place onto your current DNA? You’d be up to scratch again, right? Power wise I mean –“I &gt;
&gt; to our advantage. I offered him his glass a couple of minute later. “What if we were to find a way to permanently anchor you &gt;
&gt; did too. I remained quiet while I poured us our drinks, thinking it over, trying to ascertain and remember what we could use &gt;
&gt; dropped the bag to the floor, backing away from the ascendant to make my way to the bar. I needed a stiff drink. No doubt he &gt;
&gt; we can ‘cause one of them will certainly be the right one. Okay?”

“Okay,” I murmured in uncharacteristic compliance. I &gt;
&gt; curving into a tentative smile. “At the very least, we have two brains to think it over and come up with as many solutions as &gt;
&gt; pep talk. 

Kai appeared to notice that, his hands falling away from my shoulders to give me room to breathe again, his lips &gt;
&gt; try again. We’ll make it. Do you understand me? We WILL make it out.” I nodded and gradually relaxed in light of his inspiring &gt;
&gt; one. I’m willing to place the first bet on how little magic you had in you. We’ll make sure you’re loaded full tomorrow and &gt;
&gt; from head to toe on the walk back. I needed to stop doing this.

“Whatever happened today has an explanation. It has to have &gt;
&gt; fathom relying on it? Tears sprung to my eyes, eradicating any and all of the irrational hatred that seemed to encompass me &gt;
&gt; and we are both powerless—and well, at least I was, his magic happened to be temperamental. Which made me wonder how I could &gt;
&gt; all odds – and that means we’ll get out of here.” How could Kai know that for sure? He’d been stuck here for eighteen years &gt;
&gt; than I’ve ever had before you and Damon got here: you have hope that is actually solid. I’ve been out, and I’m back – against &gt;
&gt; with and for getting my hopes up a third time. This was his fault – this was Damon’s fault!

“But you right now have more &gt;
&gt; I stared at my former enemy turned temporary accomplice, craving to lash out, to make him pay for leaving me here to begin &gt;
&gt; “I know how you feel right now – believe me, I had too many tries on my hands to make these feelings my constant companions.” &gt;
&gt; softly as strong hands snapped me away from my rising anger and back into reality. I hadn’t even heard Kai walk in behind me. &gt;
&gt; angrily, barely resisting the urge to throw it across the living room or to break the fifty year old vase to my left. I gasped &gt;
&gt; I took in the recognizable décor I’d gotten to know over the last couple of months. I shrugged the backpack off my shoulders &gt;

&gt; around a little. “Motus,” I said. Nothing, not even a wisp of wind or warmth to immolate any kind of casting.

“Let’s go,” I &gt;
&gt; random, no longer feeling that comforting tingle, a hand outstretched before me to focus on the ground, to shift the sand &gt;
&gt; the increasing pang of disappointment once again encasing itself around my heart. “And my magic is gone,” I commented at &gt;
&gt; to change again as if on cue. It didn’t. “At least I think I did.” I hardened myself and pushed off from the rock, ignoring &gt;

&gt; eyes, annoyed by my wishy-washy emotions. How easy did I expect this to be? It was a prison for heck sake! 

“I saw it. I &gt;
&gt; hadn’t found it in me to keep talking, to motivate any kind of debate as to what might have happened and raised a hand to my &gt;
&gt; it just me, or you saw it, too? Was it snowing?” I stared at him in silence, hardly seeing him through my blurry vision. I &gt;
&gt; slumped onto the rock. I wanted to cry and rage and scream.

 “There was something… really weird happening,” he added. “Was &gt;
&gt; it before the eclipse tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow,” I uttered to myself in an inaudible whisper, all power seeping my legs as I &gt;

"I need to go to the forest. I can wait there for you if you have other things need &gt;

“Where to now?” Kai asked. I straightened up and peered over my &gt;

“Need a hand with those?” I asked, reaching to take the cardboard drinks &gt;

&gt; once I caught sight of Freya placing her order.

I washed my face and hands, feeling a little better about things once I &gt;
&gt; here with him and to continue punishing Damon. I pocketed the phone, jogging inside and headed straight for the restroom &gt;
&gt; cast a glance toward the car where Kai was still sitting, not all unaware of how ironic and hypocritical it was of me to be &gt;
&gt; pressed anymore I might have caved. “I’ll call you a bit later.”

“Bonnie, wait—“ I heard Damon say before I hung up.

I &gt;
&gt; sense that he was scowling.

“Right, well… I’ve got to go,” I said casting a glance toward the door, knowing that had he &gt;
&gt; said I was sorry,” Damon replied, adding emphasis to the last word, almost though he was beseeching me to listen. I could even &gt;
&gt; Kai down my throat for his own gain. Not even a day back and already we were falling into old inconsiderate patterns.

“I &gt;
&gt; piece.”

“I’m fine,” I added snippily. I was still irked—in spite of my alliance with said problem—that Damon tried to force &gt;
&gt; see how you were doing,” Damon responded. “You were pretty upset last night. I’m surprised Whitmore College is still in one &gt;

“I take it you’re still mad,” Damon &gt;

&gt; where the sun was starting too slid into position and rose off the flat boulder I’d been using as a chair. I closed my eyes &gt;
&gt; about our first altercation here and when my hopelessness started. 

I glanced up through the crack in the rock overhead to &gt;
&gt; if he was settling in decently enough. And for the second time—since his arrival—I was glad for it as it kept me from thinking &gt;
&gt; content to spend the next few hours listening to Kai entertain me with all the modern comparisons he’d endured. He sounded as &gt;
&gt; guess we wait,” I replied, easing around in search of a place to make myself comfortable.  I refused to leave the cave, quite &gt;
&gt; scared, not of him or what he might do – not in this second – but of being stuck here another sixty-three days or worse.

“I &gt;
&gt; is… some hours away.” I reached out to take the ascendant from him, trembling slightly as I did and returned his smile. I was &gt;
&gt; couldn’t afford it too. 

“I hope it’s working, though there’s hardly a way to check before the damn eclipse starts. Which &gt;

&gt; turned my attention back to the road conflicted, feeling guilty for dealing with the witch. I needed to call Damon, to let him &gt;
&gt; trusting. I think he'd breastfeed the child himself if he could. Are you acquainted with my siblings as well, Kai?"

I &gt;
&gt; many Hayley the werewolves out there in allegiance with Klaus. He spent enough time hunting them down. 

"Klaus is not very &gt;
&gt; the name was no more than a coincidence. It could be, after all, the name wasn’t designated to just one person, there could be &gt;
&gt; murdered on Christmas day? Caroline told me all about it. I shuddered, suddenly regretting having said yes so fast, praying &gt;
&gt; Wolf. Vampire. Witch. I haven't actually met her yet."

Hayley? As in the woman that betrayed Tyler and got his mother &gt;
&gt; comparison. 

"The mother is a girl named Haley. A wolf, but now a hybrid if I'm not mistaken. The child is...also a hybrid. &gt;
&gt; was that impossible kid in Twilight movies?” I raised a hand, waving off what I assumed was a clever joke and a willowy &gt;
&gt; matter. A) It was an impossibility and B) who’d have been forced to give up their soul for that travesty to happen?

“What &gt;
&gt; getting this? I hadn’t for one second even thought that the kid could belong to Klaus or any of the original siblings for that &gt;
&gt; he rattled on in his regular hyperactive triad, my mind reeling at the possibilities he was putting forth. Where was he even &gt;
&gt; everything in my power to find out what I could, when all of a sudden Kai spoke up.

“Klaus has a kid?!” I glanced at him as &gt;
&gt; break the promise or endurant curse somehow. I opened my mouth to assure her that she was in good hands and that I’d do &gt;
&gt; connection and what it meant for the kid she—we—were trying to protect, there had to be a way or means for her to be able to &gt;
&gt; she would not have been able to do it without me." 

Considering how strongly she felt about this woman now, about their &gt;
&gt; Dahlia and I, together. It's how she bound us in the first place. I gave my consent, chanted with her. I was only five, but... &gt;
&gt; that come the end of this alliance I wouldn’t be dead.

“But I personally believe, that the link can only be broken by &gt;
&gt; successful. Perhaps my luck will change with the two of you on my side.”

I could only hope that all our luck held up and &gt;

&gt; hand. “But it also feels as though its fading, like its temporary—“ I explained, affording no other way of making him &gt;
&gt; with one hand, the other casually turned over, an elbow braced upon my knee as if I could somehow study it in the palm of my &gt;
&gt; finding all the parts of the ascendant hadn’t been too hard.
“I can feel it,” I responded, helping him hold things in place &gt;

&gt; her a wider smile, one I hoped would cushion my insistence for answers. “But wouldn’t it be easier to sever her power &gt;
&gt; save her, like you always prayed someone would do for you?"

 “That was a stupid question on my part,” I agreed, flashing &gt;
&gt; could have more children as slaves? Now imagine that child was your niece, your own flesh and blood. Would you not want to &gt;
&gt; for company? Isolated from the rest of the world, from the rest of humanity...and yet encouraged to breed so the kidnapper &gt;
&gt; I’d be on that mission in a heartbeat. 

“Especially if you knew said child would grow up alone, with no one but its captor &gt;
&gt; you not do it?”

If I was aware of it and I had the means in which to protect them, there was not even a doubt in my mind. &gt;
&gt; semblance of a encouraging smile.

"If you had a chance, however slight, to stop a kidnapping and save an innocent child, would &gt;
&gt; who I was,” she said, her voice cracking slightly, something I recognized as sadness. I peered back, my lips forming a &gt;
&gt; it.

"I did not see my brothers and sister again until last century. Just a little glimpse during a party. They did not know &gt;
&gt; felt more of a connection to the town than just his greedy desire to further torment and punish us? I didn’t care to analyze &gt;
&gt; That explained why Klaus stayed as long as he did, even after he succeeded in forming his fleeting hybrid army. Maybe he &gt;
&gt; I had died of the plague while we was away on one of his raids. They moved after that, to what is now called Mystic Falls." &gt;
&gt; the remainder madness I’d harbored assimilating her grief seemed to pass. 

“When Esther gave me to Dahlia, she told Mikael &gt;
&gt; father. But I was raised by neither.”

That much I could remember from the array of visions she’d bestowed on me and thankfully &gt;

“But don’t worry, he’s working on his redemption and forgiveness. We both are,” I said, flashed them a sunny &gt;

“He murdered his whole family,” &gt;
&gt; me particularly cranky.

"They crafted an entire world just for you? That must have been a lot of work. Why didn't they just &gt;
&gt; mumbling to myself. “You chose to hurt me.” I relaxed into my seat, closing my eyes, deciding that my lack of sleep was making &gt;
&gt; still harbors hard feelings I have to make up for.”

“Had to hurt me?” I scoffed, folding my arms across my chest, still &gt;
&gt; “I disagreed and had to hurt her a few times to get my way. Eventually, I assisted her friends in bailing her out, but she &gt;

&gt; happened to get there one time, and she refused to let me out, even if it meant we would be stuck there forever.”

I scowled &gt;

"Perhaps we can find rations along the way?" Freya queried.

I glanced behind me &gt;

“I’m good,” I replied in a murmur, slipping the phone into my lap, reaching over my &gt;

&gt; Kai’s car with a welcome gesture to the blonde. I reached into my pocket to retrieve my phone, texting Elena to let her know I &gt;
&gt; either back me up or otherwise.

“We should probably go if we want to get there before noon,” I added and turned toward &gt;
&gt; joining us and no, I have no ties here. I was planning on heading that way myself.” I darted a look at Kai, waiting on him to &gt;
&gt; so, pausing when I comprehended what I’d said and the certain confusion to be stemmed from that. “I mean, yes, Kai will be &gt;
&gt; when I have found what we need. Can I assume you have decided to join us?"

“No,” I interjected once she gave me room to do &gt;
&gt; – the better. 

"I would love for you to come with me, but if you have ties here for the time being, I can come back for you &gt;
&gt; into the vicinity of my friends and unintentionally invite them to the party. The less they knew about anything and everything &gt;
&gt; that as I was hoping, that if I joined Freya on her expedition we wouldn’t have to go back that way, wouldn’t have to step &gt;
&gt; use some more information on how Esther and Ayana did it in the first place."

Mystic Falls? My stomach dropped a little at &gt;

“So, where do we go from &gt;
&gt; between us the night before was at an end and that we’d reached an amiable impasse.

 "I'm Freya."

I gave them a minute &gt;
&gt; partiality for suicide,” I joked. 

I regarded Kai as she did, smiling slightly to assure her that whatever she’d witnessed &gt;
&gt; "What made you change your mind?"

“Curiosity?” I added conversationally once she was in earshot. “And my now known &gt;
&gt; lips, trying to ascertain what I was going to say to this woman now and get her to open up a bit more on her strategy. &gt;

&gt; gesturing to our right. I pocketed the phone and glanced back toward the still ringing phone. 

“Shouldn’t you get that? &gt;
&gt; cutting myself short when I caught sight of her strolling back across the quad toward us. “She’s right there—“ I said &gt;
&gt; screen. She’d hung up?

I glanced behind me toward the muffled song coming from the car and then at Kai. “She—“ I started, &gt;
&gt; Where are you?” I asked. My corresponding answer that of sheer silence. I removed the phone from my ear and checked the &gt;
&gt; sure she was done talking before hesitantly holding it against my would-be damaged eardrum again. 

“Good, that’s great. &gt;
&gt; to blot him out. 

"I am still here!" 

I automatically yanked the receiver from my ear, waiting a few seconds to make &gt;
&gt; the other end of the line. I used my free hand to usher him away so I could hear her and then slid my index in my ear gently &gt;

&gt; out of the garage and onto the gravel driveway, headed for the adjoining forest that lead off the estate and in direction of &gt;

“No,” I said and gesture he follow me. I headed for the garage, slipping inside without an issue, ignoring broken &gt;
&gt; the night before, stuffed with a small medical aid kit, a water bottle and two pieces of fruit. “Got a flashlight? Just in &gt;
&gt; rather than sorry. 

“Hope you got your bags packed, Bon, ‘cause NOW we’re going home.” I picked up the travel bag I’d packed &gt;
&gt; his side to make a quick scramble for the last of my things. Not that I knew what to expect from the caves, I wanted to be safe, &gt;
&gt; door—not in 1994 at least—and nor did I ask. I picked it up, putting it down beside him and within reach, walking away from &gt;

&gt; unlocked the device and pushed call on the missed number stored in the phone and pressed it to my ear. I only hope she knew &gt;
&gt; “I have her number remember,” I said, removing the old phone Damon lent me as my own had apparently been canceled by Jeremy. I &gt;
&gt; “Unless you decided to drop the crazy idea, you better catch her by the sleeve before she drives off into the sunset.” &gt;
&gt; nodded, flashing him a disbelieving smile, no longer looking to push away his help as he gestured in direction Freya had gone. &gt;
&gt; deal with them at all.

 "Take one more advice, Bons: when venturing something suicidal, stick to positive thoughts.”

I &gt;
&gt; were we trying to protect from this woman? They had to be human as vampires couldn’t conceive, so maybe, we wouldn’t have to &gt;
&gt; at least if we failed in helping or Klaus somehow got involved. Freya hadn’t exactly told me the whole story. Whose child &gt;
&gt; damage. So maybe, just maybe, if you have me with you, it’s not a suicide as much, anymore.”

Oh, it was suicidal alright – &gt;
&gt; yet, but I do get the picture. Yes, they’re deadly, all right, but I’m not on the bottom of the list when it comes to doing &gt;
&gt; opened his mouth about Klaus at some point amidst their pow-wows? I didn’t really care. 

“I might not know the whole thing &gt;
&gt; concern, though I’m aware of that family – I did some homework.” That must have been some real heavy reading or maybe Damon &gt;
&gt; chuckled, unable to help myself. This ongoing defiance cycle of ours would never end, would it? 

“I do appreciate your &gt;

&gt; walked back over to him, picking up my juice. “Luckily, come supper time, we won’t have to worry about that issue as I’ll be &gt;
&gt; to seep into my shirt. “Dammit,” I cursed softly and retrieved a wet cloth to wipe them away. I tossed the rag aside and &gt;
&gt; chest to make sure I didn’t miss my mouth too much. I wrinkled my nose at the discovery of one or two yellow dots threatening &gt;
&gt; last dinner date, that we could do without cutlery or anything remotely pointy,” I stated, automatically peering down at my &gt;
&gt; turned around to face him, a small smile on my lips. I wasn’t at all embarrassed. “I decided—at last minute—that after our &gt;
&gt; wet hands with the dry up towel. There was no point in lying or pretending it vanished into thin air without my notice. I &gt;
&gt; beneath the water and half and half washed my face. 

“Yesterday,” I responded after a second’s hesitation, patting at my &gt;
&gt; wiped the sticky sauce away with the back of my hand and walked to the sink to wash up. I set the plate down, rinsed my hands &gt;
&gt; it some kind of a pact you made with yourself to become a wild woman that eats with her hands and cuts food with her nails?” I &gt;
&gt; yellow messily dribbling down my chin, not at all cooperating with the spoon. “And when did that awesome idea strike you? Was &gt;
&gt; virtually inhaled what remained on the plate. 

“So tell me, how come you got rid of the cutlery?” I was still chewing, egg &gt;
&gt; in days and my drinkathon hadn’t helped issues. “Oh, it’s good.

“Is it,” I chimed in, neglectful of my manners as I &gt;
&gt; a soft hem of gratitude, bit by bit feeling the queasiness start to diminish and work away the haze. I hadn’t eaten correctly &gt;
&gt; Kai spoon egg into his mouth, relieved to see that sleep had helped to some extent and that he was looking better. I expelled &gt;
&gt; cranky. I’m cranky when hungry, so you don’t want me hungry when my focus’s important to you. You’re welcome.” 

I watched &gt;
&gt; Kai’s story, as eager as I was to get out of here, I still wasn’t sure I could fully trust him. “It’s all gonna get cold and I &gt;
&gt; the egg yolk, using my index finger to push of the egg white onto it, unruffled by the extra hassle. As much as I believed &gt;
&gt; huge favor and spare you a few hours of handcrafting some major failure of a cutlery piece.” I chuckled softly and cut around &gt;

&gt; question, and yet—I felt it only fair to tell him of what to expect. “You give them even a little room and they’ll rip &gt;
&gt; life,” I stated, now sharing my own advice. I should be grateful, relieved that someone was willing to do this with me without &gt;
&gt; with perceptible inquisitiveness. I shook off the question for a moment and pressed on. “You don’t want these people in your &gt;
&gt; suddenly you want to join me on this suicide mission? Why?” I asked, unable to help adding the last question, staring at him &gt;
&gt; a response. “You just gave me the motivational speech of all speeches, most of which consisted of me being crazy and now &gt;
&gt; be the right one to cast for a wingman.”

“What?” I said once he took a breather and actually gave me a chance to formulate &gt;
&gt; you fly or die, that paints you as the craziest witch I’d ever met. And since too many think I’m that kind of crazy, I might &gt;
&gt; know but there was one thing I was certain of – Freya’s power. 

“If you really intend to jump off that cliff not knowing if &gt;
&gt; only thing I had left to lose anymore. There might be holes, things I still wasn’t aware of and would take a while getting to &gt;
&gt; wasn’t prepared for the Mikaelsons. I knew better to understate them and my life—although lost to me three times—was about the &gt;
&gt; dedicated magic regime. I was considering it because I refused to let anything happen upon chance or out of spite because I &gt;
&gt; willing to look into the blonde witch’s compatibility with charms because I wanted to commit suicide or fall into her &gt;
&gt; right about that. Then again, he’d been right about a lot of things in the last fifteen minutes. Except for one. I wasn’t &gt;
&gt; this or whom I could talk to, not in the friend department anyway and I could hardly deal with strangers. Kai was certainly &gt;
&gt; in my very short life someone appeared to be reading me and my inner crisis like a book. There was no one else to trust with &gt;
&gt; back to face him, staying quiet through the entirety of his lengthy speech. I didn’t know what to say and for the first time &gt;
&gt; none of them you’ll ever trust if you can’t trust your own inner sensors.” 

I folded my arms across my chest as I turned &gt;
#DevilsContract @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest -- [[“There are thousands of thousands of spells and charms and jujus, Bonnie, but &gt;

&gt; Freya cared to show me those images and what she could gain—if this Dahlia woman didn’t exist. Unless she was the one looking &gt;
&gt; good or whatever else you think she could have in mind beneath that damaged exterior of hers.” I still couldn’t fathom why &gt;
&gt; more. “I can’t. I won’t risk not knowing for sure or pretend that all of this might be some grand scheme to finish me off for &gt;
&gt; going anywhere. I’m not running,” I said stubbornly, voicing my final decision aloud, my tone having lost of its edge once &gt;
&gt; exhaling as I did to rid myself of my little outburst and turned to look in the direction the blonde disappeared. 

“I’m not &gt;
&gt; comprehending how ridiculous that sounded in regards to what we were discussing and who I was talking to. I took a step back, &gt;
&gt; maybe, just maybe… all of this is some poorly designed nightmare and I’m still coughing away in 1994.” I fell quiet, &gt;
&gt; walking across the quad to their next class or car, “—is all some sick godforsaken dream I have yet to wake up from! That &gt;
&gt; that all of this—“ I gestured wildly around me with a hysterical little laugh, taking in the campus trees and the students &gt;
&gt; thrown my way. I want to stop fearing shadows and someone laughing too hard and, more importantly, I want to stop dreading &gt;
&gt; my future didn’t look all that slim either, “—is to be free of this constant life-or-death bullshit that’s constantly being &gt;
&gt; head reeling from the overall emotions intermingled with my own hurt from the previous day – coming back had not been easy and &gt;
&gt; friends to be happy, for Caroline’s mother not to be dead and her humanity a thing of the past. What I want,” I continued, my &gt;
&gt; “What do I want,” I repeated in a contemplative murmur as if considering the seriousness of what he’d asked me. “Is for my &gt;
&gt; barriers, whether you wanted them to or not. They were merciless and cold. 
“So… what do YOU want, Bonnie?” he asked in close. &gt;
&gt; have a point as he continued to voice his view on what I’d showed him. Mikaelsons were good at manipulation and breaking down &gt;
&gt; expect to go about it differently? I grimaced in light of his inappropriate joke, hesitantly admitting to myself that he might &gt;
&gt; they’re authentic or she merely has an outstanding imagination capable of crafting a perfect blockbuster.” 

And how did he &gt;
&gt; lingering warmth of his touch.

“You know, when you show someone another person’s memories, it’s impossible to tell whether &gt;

&gt; into his head, minus the devastating rush of grief I’d experienced.]] @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest #DevilsContract
&gt;  I waited until he took me hand, until he validated his consent and then – like she had done – I projected that same proof &gt;
&gt; bestowed on me if I focused on them long enough. “You want to know what’s going on, what she said to me, then let me show you." &gt;
&gt; him to take. “At least for the minute.” I could still feel those harrowed emotions and see the visual flashbacks she’d &gt;
&gt; make up my mind as if he had all the time in the world. 

“We’re in this together,” I said, holding out my right hand for &gt;
&gt; different. I walked over to the driver’s side where he was leaning against the door, arms folded, patiently waiting for me to &gt;
&gt; distaste, pushing off the hood of the car, forcing myself to remember – as I witnessed last night and right now – that he was &gt;
&gt; indifferent telling of his family’s brutal massacre. 

“Like I said, it’s your call.”

I wrinkled my nose with implicit &gt;
&gt; handsome. Innocent attraction that died with that newspaper and the pleasure that radiated off his face as he delighted in the &gt;
&gt; him, there was no denying that to myself, although I would. In fact, I’d thought Kai somewhat amusing, quirky and particularly &gt;
&gt; even suicidal – again. 

“Bad example. But true, nonetheless. Before you read the damn paper, you liked me.” 

I had liked &gt;
&gt; the mention of my former naivety, loathing the fact he appeared to be out and out accusing me of being senseless or perhaps &gt;
&gt; she give you? How come you’re so trusting? After everything you’ve been through, even in that prison world?” 

I flinched at &gt;
&gt; still keeping us cloaked and for how long he could maintain a spell like that. How powerful had he become? 

“What proof did &gt;
&gt; I was thinking about it, too much so and I guess that may have been the problem. I scrutinized him, wondering if he were &gt;
&gt; immortals… What is it, war of gods or something? The epic battle of gods and titans, pick your side now? Just think about it.” &gt;
&gt; exactly, should I be convinced by – I know only what she said now, and it doesn’t really make much sense. Firstborns, &gt;
&gt; said in the last five minutes that was the thing that summed up his faith in what she was selling. 

“And what story, &gt;
&gt; cave she crawled out of? Was it Ice Age?” I chuckled quietly, shaking my head lightly, surprised that out of everything Freya &gt;

&gt; coming back here and ripping everything I died for apart,” I added, shuddering at the thought. “Unless, “I said averting my &gt;
&gt; tended and untended. What if Klaus had already gotten to my mother? “I can’t afford to take that chance. I can’t have them &gt;
&gt; to begin with. How would she know to look for me?” I stated, truly believing that and fearing the worst of what was to come &gt;
&gt; I’m on that list. Be it her list or Klaus’s list. One way or another, I’m on it. I have to be, otherwise she wouldn’t be here &gt;
&gt; time. If Dahlia gets what she wants, not only will she put an end to some innocent child’s life, but everyone in her path. And &gt;
&gt; being dragged behind her. I closed my eyes a second, inhaling deeply and leaned against the hood of his car. “There isn’t much &gt;
&gt; What reason does she have to lie? Besides, you heard her,“ I said, overcome with an image of Dahlia and the screaming child &gt;
&gt; for his evasive concern. “Eighteen or so years spent in a magical prison world for one and you’re unconvinced by her story? &gt;
&gt; know how to reach me."

I fought feelings of persevering offence at his rash action and something akin to genuine appreciation &gt;
&gt; on what he’d done too, cutting into what was being said before I could speak up.

"If you decide to come out of hiding, you &gt;
&gt; planned to escape, it’s your perfect chance. We drive away now and she won’t find you. Your call.” Freya appeared to pick up &gt;
&gt; me. I glanced back at him, opening my mouth to ask him what he’d done when he added: “And yeah, I cloaked us, so if you &gt;
&gt; you’re not seriously considering to throw your life away – again – and this time for a farce like that.” Kai said from behind &gt;
&gt; slightly with obvious perplexity, like she was looking right through me. I mirrored her confusion.

“Now, Bonnie, tell me &gt;
#DevilsContract @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest -- [["Of course--" I heard Freya say before she feel silent, her eyes widening &gt;
&gt; back to her again. “There are a few things I need to get in order first. I can’t just up and leave.”]] @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest #DevilsCon
&gt; certain it would reflect on my screen as a missed call. 

“Before I make plans to go with you,” I said, extending the phone &gt;
&gt; her dialing pad for a second, forcing aside the increasing fear that rose in me and reluctantly dialed my number upon her phone, &gt;
&gt; and checked her contacts, scowling when I saw her phone list consisted of two names. Elijah and Rebekah. I stood staring at &gt;
&gt; took it and turned toward Kai who was surprisingly quiet. I knew that probably wouldn’t last too long. I unlocked her phone &gt;
&gt; mind, and I pray that you do. You may reach me on this...infernal device,” she said in conclusion, handing me her cellphone. I &gt;
&gt; there preparing to massacre masses of family and otherwise.  

"I don't have time to linger here unless you change your &gt;
&gt; of what I hoped would be a fruitful life looking over my shoulder knowing there was such a harsh imbalance of nature out &gt;
&gt; relish in the sound of Dahlia becoming immortal or the idea of her come for me in twenty years or less. I couldn’t spend the rest &gt;
&gt; the child, she will be strong enough to make herself truly immortal." I had to admit as I listened to her again, that I didn’t &gt;
&gt; her own, she will be unstoppable. The firstborns in our family carry unimaginable magic, and by binding herself to both me and &gt;
&gt; "But I think it is only fair you know: Dahlia is drawn to power. She craves it. Needs it. If she is able to claim my niece as &gt;
&gt; force you to co-operate." Funny, from my experience, that was the customary Mikaelson repertoire for getting things done. &gt;
&gt; appeared in front of me, forcing me to swallow the remainder of my sentence. I took an automatic step back. "I am not going to &gt;
&gt; instructed and turned to make my way around the front of the car.  “We’ve a four hour journey ahead of us and—“

Freya &gt;
&gt; somewhat biddable smile. He continued to peer at me as though sensing there was more to the story. “We should go,” I &gt;
&gt; yet, anyway. What, did she breathe fire in your coffee?”

“She might as well have,” I responded, flashing him a hurried and &gt;
&gt; “There’s no dragon on your heel if that’s what you’re thinking.” I automatically cast a glance behind me to check. 

“Not &gt;
&gt; under the rug, but the feelings gifted by the woman through her shared vision didn’t permit such casual a dismissal. &gt;

&gt; with paper and two sticks, though I imagine it would be similar to a spoon,” I said, clearly joking, in high spirits and &gt;
&gt; to him, setting them down before him on the counter. “You’ll have to make do with your hand. Or… I could fashion you something &gt;
&gt; with a spoon.”

“I got rid of them,” I stated, my cheeks flushing slightly as I removed the two glasses needed. I walked over &gt;
&gt; assigned glass cupboard. “Oh, and… where did all the forks go? There’s none in the drawers. I’m really loath to eat this &gt;
&gt; knew it wouldn’t be for much longer. “Get us glasses,” he said and picked up a pitcher of juice. I nodded and approached the &gt;

“I’m already out the door,” I interjected jovially, shifting my gaze to the windows. It was still dark outside, but I &gt;
&gt; didn’t expect to see him cooking. “Morning, sunshine. Let’s have our last breakfast here and get the hell out, whatta ya &gt;
&gt; room and then the kitchen in search of Kai, satisfied—after last night’s demonstration—that he couldn’t leave without me. I &gt;
&gt; before, adorned in denim shorts, hiking boots and a logo less t-shirt. I was ready to go. I stopped by the parlor, the living &gt;
&gt; bourbon raid and another ten brushing my teeth once done. I headed downstairs feeling considerably better than I had the day &gt;
&gt; floor in front of the toilet, spending a unpleasant ten minutes bent over the porcelain bowl exorcising the former day’s &gt;
&gt; untangled my legs from the sheets with clumsy haste and ran for my en-suite bathroom. I dropped to my knees on the titled &gt;
&gt; on the top of the small radio. Nausea hit me immediately, a familiar—and horrid—sensation working its way up my throat. I &gt;
&gt; couple of hours later.

I shot up into an automatic sitting position when my alarm went off, banging away at the flat button &gt;
&gt; couple more hours and then I’d be free of this place for good. A celebration that wouldn’t hurt. And it didn’t. Not until a &gt;
&gt; around the kitchen to the perfected beat of TLC’s CrazySexyCool album.  I’d survived a lot this day and there was only a &gt;
&gt; a minutes at a time, too excited and too anxious about what to expect from the morrow. I eased off my chair and slowly danced &gt;
&gt;  I could hang in there a few more hours.

I stayed downstairs for a while longer, incapable of closing my eyes for more than &gt;
&gt; chair, taking pleasure in the fact that although I was still stuck in this god forsaken prison world – at least I wasn’t alone. &gt;
&gt; done it and he was still here. That mattered. I finished my cognac, closed my eyes and relaxed my head against the back of the &gt;
&gt; wanted and deserved. Saving me might not have been on Kai’s priority list of things to do today when he woke, but he’d still &gt;
&gt; stairs again, harboring a sudden desire to thank him for saving my life. I didn’t though – choosing to let him get the rest he &gt;
&gt; lowered the glass to the table with a small beholden smile, wrestling with the idea of calling him back as he headed for the &gt;
&gt; make sure I stayed dead – though it wouldn’t work – but would be messy. And creepy, for someone like you. Goodnight.” I &gt;
&gt; he shared what and when he felt like it and could go on for quite some time. “And, I guess, for not chopping my head off to &gt;
&gt; the top of my glass, dumbfounded by his unforeseen courteousness. Typically Kai didn’t care whether a person listened or not, &gt;
&gt; faltered slightly as he drew to a stop inside the archway to look back at me. “Thanks. For listening.” I stared at him over &gt;
&gt; aptly put it, taking a long indulgent sip as he went in search of a place to lay his head down for the night. He’s footsteps &gt;
&gt; Don’t be late for the Home-Express. I gotta lie down.” I tipped my glass in pseudo salute, confirming our ‘date’ as he so &gt;

&gt; parking lot. What kind of car would he be driving now and—

“Hey!” I said when I caught sight of Kai, a rush of &gt;
&gt; before she could see me, wiping my dirty fingertips upon my jeans, and rushed across the quad to get a better look of the &gt;
&gt; about it? I expelled a sigh and spared a paranoid look around, stiffening when I caught sight of the blonde. I got to my feet &gt;
&gt; explanation I have to all this inner-turmoil and threadbare indecisiveness. And how could I still be feeling so mad at Damon &gt;
&gt; spend a few hours trapped with the very last person I cared to ever see again? I was losing my mind. It’s the only viable &gt;
&gt; I’d been carrying in my left hand. I couldn’t help but wonder how my whole world had taken such a dive when I was willing to &gt;
&gt; there.

I moved to take a seat on a cement bench beneath a large oak while I waited, finishing off the soggy slice of pizza &gt;
&gt; night talking protection spells while simultaneously asking him to drive me back to Mystic Falls as if I trusted he’d get me &gt;
&gt; in the land of the living. I loathed Kai—and loved Damon—and yet here I was, accepting the power-sucker’s calls, spending the &gt;
&gt; “I’ll see you in five,” I repeated before he hung up. I couldn’t believe things stooped this far down my third day back &gt;

&gt; if past experience taught me anything, it was that the Mikaelsons tended not to give those to people. “Where are you? Are you &gt;
&gt; wasn’t as if I didn’t have a choice in the matter – then again – I hadn’t stuck around long enough to find out if I did, and &gt;
&gt; dread, forcing myself to relax and to put more distance between the cafeteria and myself. Freya said she meant me no harm. It &gt;
&gt; in one piece… sort of,” I responded, casting a glance over my shoulder, afraid she might have followed me. I shook off my &gt;
&gt; my phone and answered the call, hardly getting a word in edgewise when I heard Kai’s recognizable voice cross the line. “I’m &gt;
&gt; involuntary step away from the table and quickly headed toward the entranceway. As soon as I cleared the busy room I removed &gt;
&gt; information than necessary. “Thank you for the breakfast.” I picked up my unfinished and bare picked slice of pizza, taking an &gt;
&gt; reply as I shuffled out of the booth, too afraid I might let these linger feelings cloud my judgement and hand her more &gt;
&gt; not, it didn't matter, I wasn't going to take the risk -- not willingly. “I hope you understand.” I didn’t wait for Freya's &gt;
&gt; can’t. And nor will I.” I rose to stand with finality, cutting short anymore of her appeal. Whether the woman knew them or &gt;
&gt; comfort from the phone still buzzing within my pocket and the reminder that I wasn’t alone. “But I don’t trust Mikaelsons. I &gt;
&gt; information to be immaterial. “I’m sorry about what you’ve had to deal with, the life you’ve had, your child—“ I said, taking &gt;
&gt; the rest of our lives a living hell.” I wasn’t going to elaborate on the how or why as I believed that particular piece of &gt;
&gt; meeting mode. 'Was it Kai or Damon?' I wondered. “In fact… they spent near on two years terrorizing my best friend and making &gt;
&gt; the Mikaelsons. I stiffened as the phone in my pocket started ringing, vibrating against the top of my thigh quietly on &gt;
&gt; your family many times in the past,” I responded factually, clearing up any misconceptions she might have of my history with &gt;
&gt; with a twisted sense of motherly security.  I needed to focus now more than ever and get my guard back up. “I have dealt with &gt;
&gt; still see and feel the utter devastation that stayed with Freya for centuries while the woman who drove her to it provided her &gt;
&gt; best way to answer her question, still reeling from the overwhelming emotions that had been forced on me a second ago. I could &gt;

&gt; Ayana were part of the reason my mother happened to be a vampire. “Esther Mikaelson? You’re a Mikaelson?” I asked, withdrawing &gt;
&gt; spoken more than once a year ago and knew of only one such connection. The Mikaelsons. There was no way to forget. Esther and &gt;
&gt; woman’s face and when I did, all time stopped. I knew Ayana – it was only now I could put a face to her – I’d heard the name &gt;
&gt; work through the mass of material I was given and trying to find some peace of mind again. It took me awhile to remember the &gt;
&gt; circular caress of Freya’s thumb. “Esther.” I murmured, rolling the name around on my tongue as I stared at Freya, trying to &gt;
&gt; my emotion or theirs? I couldn’t tell anymore, I didn’t know how to react and seemed to be anchored only by the soothing &gt;
&gt; to absorb everything I’d witnessed and the lingering relief that coursed through me as the two figures spell ended. Was that &gt;
&gt; unending parade of imageries found their conclusion and zapped us back to the present. I was breathing slightly heavy, trying &gt;
&gt; from this vindictive demon of a woman. It was a feeling that was hard to shake and seemed to linger even when at long last her &gt;
&gt; while enduring the rest of the images gifted to me, I craved nothing more than to hug her, to comfort Freya and shield her &gt;
&gt; to loosen their girp, wanting to break from of this torment and the woman’s unending heartbreak. I was unable and for a time, &gt;
&gt; extreme. To not only take her life but that of her child’s as well. A sob threatened to spill from my lips, my hands wanting &gt;
&gt; ached with empathy. I’d been there, I’d felt that despair and could only imagine what Freya endured to be pushed to such an &gt;
&gt; view, the noticeable bump, the determination and sheer will to save herself in the only way she deemed possible, my heart &gt;
&gt; it—before stopping on the innocent girl’s face. We mirrored each other’s expressions of horror. When the next image came into &gt;
&gt; and a shiver ran up my spine, my eyes fixed on the widely spread bodies in front of me—as if I were there and a part of &gt;
&gt; screams steadily giving way, revealing an image of a woman with dark hair and lifeless eyes. My stomach turned with revulsion &gt;
&gt; mother’s side and dragged away. I could feel her fear and heartbreak as she wailed for her mother to save her. The child’s &gt;

&gt; let me show you what I have seen?" she asked, offering up her hand. I stared at it a moment with consideration and then decidedly &gt;
&gt; a second thought. That was the way of war. I knew that much and even understood it to some degree. We’d taken on too much. "Will you &gt;
&gt; fault. I’d pushed her too hard without understanding the consequences; then my mother, raked in by the Mikaelsons and condemned without &gt;
&gt; disposal my family became over the years – and myself – like substitutable talismans. First my grandmother – that, of course, was my &gt;
&gt; one stronger.’ The sentence played over and over in my head like a warning beacon. I hated the sound of that, I hated how important and &gt;

&gt; to say ‘dead’ or that I’d ONLY just returned to the land of the living a day ago. “Maybe… if I understood exactly what it is &gt;
&gt; I swallowed, dabbing at the corner of my mouth with my index finger. “I—I’ve been out of the loop for a while—“ I wasn’t going &gt;
&gt; rejection or to gather more information. I couldn’t decide. “But I’m not sure I’m who or what you’re looking for,” I added as &gt;
&gt; and sympathize. I really do,” I said and took a larger bite of my pizza, buying myself a little time to formulate a decent &gt;
&gt; this woman and nor did I know Freya and I was no longer as quick and naïve to trust just anyone anymore. 

“I do understand &gt;
&gt; wretched woman Dahlia was after. Nevertheless, I feared what would happen to me if I got into the middle of it. I didn’t know &gt;
&gt; – for half a year. I couldn’t imagine a lifetime of such a similar extremity. I pitied her, I pitied the child whomever this &gt;
&gt; used either. I was a slave to my ancestors, to Shane, to Silas and for a time even Kai. Terror that lasted – unbeknownst to me &gt;
&gt; it, quietly sucking the tomato sauce off the tip of my finger once she finished.
I was no stranger to being manipulated and &gt;
&gt;  I was rather surprised when it didn’t.

I folded the bare slice of pizza in half as she finished, nibbling at the end of &gt;
&gt; I unwearyingly waited for the mention of his name, for the shoe to drop and his good-guy-routine to be blasted to kingdom come. &gt;
&gt; lives depended on him. I had no way of knowing whether that status changed or for how long and for right now – I didn’t care. &gt;
&gt; been: Kai. He was here, he’d imposed his reign of terror and the Gemini coven feared him—or at least they did—before their &gt;
&gt; giving her the breathing room needed to make her appeal. 
At the beginning, the first evil witch that popped into my head had &gt;
&gt; something I imagined one might get from a fairytale. I focused on my pizza toppings, popping them into my mouth bit by bit, &gt;
"And I need your help to defeat an evil witch." Varied emotions played upon my face, the beginning of her anecdote &gt;
&gt; due to nervousness and yet, to me, she looked as if she had a lot on her mind. And no viable way in which to truly express it. &gt;
&gt; her know I remembered as much and watched her fiddle with her tea cup. An emotional tick one might cursorily have assumed was &gt;

&gt; he looked as if he’d been run over by a mac track and dragged a few miles. My only hope was that it was a temporary look for &gt;

“Is it,” I commented, taking a large gulp of my drink, my head instantly fuzzier. There was no way we &gt;
&gt; slimmer. “God, I’m starving. Must be the whole dying thing. Now that I think about it, it does come back, the hunger and all. &gt;

&gt; in menu, wondering how the blonde managed to convince the cafeteria staff to warm up pizza and burgers. Around here, the menu &gt;
&gt; wasn't certain if you'd already had breakfast, or…" I cast a second glance at the food stuffs, cataloging the drastic change &gt;

&gt; one of the cafeteria ladies was tending to her like diner wait staff and then sat down on the chair opposite her without her &gt;
&gt; hard to find.

“Hi,” I said as I approached her, taking in the assortment of foods that littered her table and the fact that &gt;
&gt; with students preparing to head home for the weekend, to take full advantage of their time off or to study. Freya hadn’t been &gt;

When I showed up at the cafeteria, it was crowded &gt;

&gt;  I’d eventually given up and passed out sometime before sunrise. I padded across the room, being sure to be quiet as not to &gt;
&gt; a connection with my ancestors – none that I was satisfied with at least. This I knew was of my own doing and my own insecurities. &gt;
&gt; fully awake by the time I’d untangled myself from the sheets. I’d been unable to sleep the night before and struggling to make &gt;

&gt; through the curtains and dared a look across the room to where I could see another figure soundly asleep. I sat up and &gt;
&gt; head off the cushion with a struggle. It weighed a ton. I glanced around, taking in the sunlight streaming in &gt;
&gt; more alert I became until I reached over to turn the alarm off. I groaned and drew my arms up beneath my body, lifting my &gt;

&gt; entertained and all at once curious. “I know you’re helping him with his mother… or you were. I just… I’d like to deal with &gt;
&gt; following me the short distance, “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention this to Damon or Elena.” He looked momentarily &gt;
&gt; started toward the dorm room door, hoping he’d take the hint and of my unspoken gratitude. “Also,” I added once he started &gt;
&gt; probably look at finding that connection and with any luck, I’ll be able to get some sleep before my date tomorrow morning.” I &gt;
&gt; milked him for the information needed. “It’s getting late,” I said, signaling to the door with shrewd politeness. “I should &gt;

&gt; twenty to forty minutes, unsure of how much time had passed since the woman left.

“I trust you’re right about this,” I said &gt;
&gt; seal the deal. As for the proof – you will get it on the meeting.” 

I nodded, absorbing everything he’d told me in the last &gt;
&gt; stood.

“Call upon whoever gave you the ring and ask them to put their power in it to protect you, and offer your blood to &gt;
&gt; finally lock the door.”  

I slipped the necklace around my throat, struggling for a second with the small fastener and &gt;
&gt; my home or at that creepy old mansion we stored the daggered originals in for a few weeks.

“It may even be right here – if you &gt;
&gt;know you can establish the best connection with them.” 

The only place I was ever able to do that was in Mystic Falls, in &gt;
&gt; was uncontrolled and the fourth – wasn’t going to happen.

“So, take your ring, your grimoire, and go to a place where you &gt;
&gt; the balances were shaky and I was pushing the limits. Grams warned me about it and TWICE I’d ignored her pleading, the third &gt;

I wasn’t so sure that was true as I’d been able to make magic even when &gt;

&gt; they’d care to listen? I need something tangible – proof.”]] @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest #DevilsContract
&gt; pressing on nonetheless. “That doesn’t fill me with a lot of confidence. I mean—I might have angered them once or twice, who’s to say &gt;
&gt; swing at me and depending on whether my ancestors choose to listen or not, I might be able to throw up a block or two?” I asked, &gt;
&gt; or two. You understand?” “So, basically… what you’re saying is, I can’t null her power all together. But if she were to take a magical &gt;
&gt; partners wins. If the powers behind her are stronger than your line, your protection won’t be absolute. But it still can ease a blow &gt;
&gt; how could I be certain it would work? How did I go about testing it? “And if it comes to a confrontation, the one with stronger &gt;
&gt; into my lap, hesitantly easing the ring onto my middle finger. They’d never possessed any magic before, none that’d I’d remembered, &gt;
&gt; another witch of your family line, you can use it as, say, a whistle, a beacon for those powers to guard you.” I dropped the necklace &gt;
&gt; slightly, closing my fingers around the jewelry, drawing my arm against me protectively. “If either of these, was given to you by &gt;
&gt; want protection – you need to ask for it, ask those who are your power.” And how was I supposed to go about doing that? I frowned &gt;
&gt; through and the emotions I felt when it came to dispatching of my foes. Even killing Kai hadn’t been passionless. “Therefore, if you &gt;
&gt; your emotions, with calling to those ancestors, drawing from them. When you’re calm, it’s nothing big.” Going off what I knew I’d been &gt;
&gt; something.” He got all that from a minutes look? “Like, she’s always carrying it with her. You – not so much. Your power spikes with &gt;
&gt; blondie witch – I’d have to get a personal reading to know anything for sure – but her power seems to… I don’t know… at a ready, or &gt;
&gt; I’d done with expression? That was nature, an abomination of sorts, but a form of nature nonetheless. “Now, I don’t know about that &gt;

&gt; enough to hold magic and were made of the correct material. I remembered bits and pieces of my grandmother talking to me about minerals &gt;

&gt; for hearing me out, and… be careful, Bon.”

“Wait,” I said again, flicking my wrist, the door closing before he could think to &gt;
&gt; list. 

Kai motioned toward the door and prepared to leave, smiling slightly as he did, looking markedly awkward. “Thanks &gt;
&gt; Elena she had a tendency of screwing things up for me—unintentionally of course— and as for Damon, well… he was on my naughty &gt;
&gt; so I don’t expect you to be happy about having me help, so… yeah.” No way in hell was that happening. As much as I loved &gt;
&gt; distract her. I would gladly provide my company, but just an hour ago you threatened to melt my face off if you saw me again, &gt;
&gt; “And tomorrow call the nasty vamp couple and have them oversee the meeting if you mean to go there. At the very least, they’d &gt;

&gt; happening to him a span of two months? Or was this after he massacred his family and they sought to lock him up? 

“Given &gt;
&gt; anymore, I’ve lost count of people trying to kill me or subdue me or put me away someplace.” Was he talking about all of this &gt;
&gt; to keep you safe. Maybe I’m overdoing it – I mean, I got to, because ever since I’ve returned to this world I barely know &gt;
&gt; hate to scare you so much – that I really do – but if you ain’t scared, you won’t be careful enough, and it’s the only thing &gt;

“Bonnie, I really didn’t mean—“ he started, as if &gt;
&gt; simple though? I would have to spend some more time with my grandmother’s grimoire to make certain or I could take advantage &gt;

&gt; cornering someone you don’t know: wasn’t it exactly what she did minutes before I walked in?” He was right. I should have &gt;
&gt; either.” I only got back a night ago, I definitely wasn’t ready to lose anymore. Not my life. Not my friends lives.

&gt; control my vying thoughts. 

“You’re right. When all of a sudden there’s a power-soaked witch seeking you out, you should be &gt;
&gt; possibly flick his wrist and make it happen. I grimaced, hating the fact that he was trying to scare me and that I couldn’t &gt;
&gt; sitting up like an avid listener?” If that was something I—or he—were inclined to doing, it wouldn’t be hard, hell he could &gt;
&gt; and still make it look civil while that immobile person is inwardly boiling or passing out or already dead and yet still &gt;

“And that’s not a sloppy vampire, Bon.” I paused nearer the door. &gt;

“Right. I didn’t think of that,” I said while nibbling on a second slice of sandwich meat, quietly &gt;

“Maybe,” I replied, confirming what could be a genuine possibility. 

“We can try to get out now if you want – &gt;

&gt; aloud, standing once more, starting toward the door to see him out. “I appreciate the concern by the way.” And I truly did. It &gt;
&gt; know in order to chit chat. I just wanted to know where she was, how close or how far or how concerned I should be,” I mused &gt;
&gt; “I may seem crazy, Kai.” And I probably was. Solitary did that to a person. “But I’m not looking to corner someone I don’t &gt;

&gt; sides, hoping for some kind of address or even a snippet of information. Nada.  

“I know that—it radiates off her, off &gt;
&gt; powerful than you are.” I removed the hand from my face and took the piece of paper back. I unfolded it and checked both &gt;
&gt; and catch up to her. It’s, like, five minutes that she’s gone? I don’t suggest you go alone, though. She’s way more &gt;
&gt; doubt you have a map of Whitmore or whatever one you need. But if we’re serious, it’s ten times more effective to just go now &gt;

&gt; to know who she is and why she’s looking for me. How hard do you think it would be to do a locator with that? Is it even &gt;
&gt; toward him. I almost hated myself for giving in so easily, for considering to share even a tenth of my newest problem. “I want &gt;
&gt; you could help me with something.” I raised the folded piece of paper Freya gave me between index and middle and extended &gt;
&gt; expression. I didn’t think he could fake that – not properly. I couldn’t give him what he wanted though. “Before you go, maybe &gt;
&gt; again.”

“Wait,” I said in a gentle tone, my eyes maintaining their thoughtful hold on his face, registering his earnest &gt;
&gt; hazy, violent and scary. 

“It’s all I wanted to say. Now I can disappear from your life so you could learn to feel safe &gt;
&gt; be, not for a long time and not until I felt human again. For now, I hardly even knew where I belonged anymore. Everything was &gt;
&gt; that maybe in some distant future you’d consider forgiving me.” 

I wasn’t sure I was capable of that and knew I wouldn’t &gt;
&gt; on his last leg. He was right, this was what we needed. At least to some extent. 

“And it’s really important for me to hope &gt;
&gt; dumbly, surprised by how much sense that made, feeling a little more at peace with the entire situation once he appeared to be &gt;
&gt; your own life. I did it because I didn’t care if you would. I didn’t have it in me to care… before. Now I do.” 

I nodded &gt;
&gt; that I didn’t do it all back there to make you suffer, to leave you there for eternity in my stead so you’d go crazy or take &gt;
&gt; one and after everything I’d endured with Silas, I hadn’t been eager to repeat that mistake. 

“And I needed you to know &gt;
&gt; scared me and the very reason I hadn’t wanted him roaming around freely. There was a reason he’d been locked up there – a good &gt;
&gt; even amused for that matter, going so far as to admit he’d done the exact same thing and felt nothing. That’s the part that &gt;
&gt; and attempt to attack me. That was his style. Yet it never came and nor did he look remotely annoyed by my cruel admission or &gt;
&gt; for the other shoe to drop, half-expecting Kai to start laughing, to admit that everything he was saying was a big fat joke &gt;
&gt; trying to sell me? Or was that Damon? 

“I’m only here because of what I did to you – and you only.” 

I continued to wait &gt;
&gt; me the charity talk.” 

I arched my brows slightly, incapable of burying my immediate curiosity. Wasn’t that what he’d been &gt;
#DevilsContract @WitchMisplaced @KaiJest -- [[I narrowed my eyes as he began to chuckle. “I’m not that good even now, so save &gt;

&gt; was even making sense. I plucked a piece of meat from inside the see-through container, lightly gesturing that he help himself &gt;
&gt; to steal it from me temporarily… maybe now… the prisons simply reverted you back to your former state.“ I frowned, uncertain I &gt;
&gt; he could catch onto my thinking. “Wouldn’t that reset your magic use here? I mean… before you left you were able to use it, &gt;
&gt; logically. If I were hurt or unable to do the spell, neither of us would get out. “Like you did before—“ I explained so that &gt;
&gt; hand to lift the lid off the tupperware. “What if you were to take it from me again?” I asked. I had to think about it &gt;
&gt; here. Maybe even now.” I sat down opposite him again and nodded, reaching for the bottle to refill my glass, using my other &gt;
&gt; least you have some power. And if it worked to give it to you once, it will again shall we need to. So we can still get out of &gt;
&gt; wasn’t sure I was particularly happy about that revelation as that was the same predisposition that had him attack me. “At &gt;
&gt; still here – that searing urge to set my father’s guts on a slow fire. At least in that I’m me,” he said and glanced at me. I &gt;
&gt; seated. I berated myself internally, pulling free the sealed Tupperware and wondered over to the table once more. “Yeah, it’s &gt;
&gt; angrily hit the table. I stopped what I was doing to collect myself and subconsciously peered over my shoulder. He was still &gt;
&gt; was bound to cause a problem. I reached for some cold meat, jerking in surprise and a smidgen of unanticipated fear as his mug &gt;
&gt; That’s fucking hilarious.” I frowned, confused by his statement, hazily replaying it in my head before it dawned on me. This &gt;
&gt; keeping me in – and that can work if I don’t have magic no matter what, even if, in fact, I have it. Therefore I can’t use it. &gt;

“This place still insists on &gt;

“You still look like you,” I commented impractically, not certain I’d &gt;

&gt; wouldn’t have thought twice about going back.” I needed him to know that, wanted to see the reality sink in and whether or not &gt;
&gt; and why everything spiraled out of control. “I hurt you too. More than once… and had I succeeded in leaving you there to begin with, I &gt;
&gt; make a difference. You don’t need to apologize to me. I’m not innocent,” I stated, all too aware of my position in all of this &gt;
&gt; compassionate human being and truly feel repentant? Then prove it. Take up charity at a homeless shelter, aid the needy and &gt;
&gt; spend time arguing back and forth with him all night. “You want to make amends? You want to live in society as a normal &gt;
&gt; whole I’m-a-good-guy routine of yours, but I’m not falling for it,” I stated, making sure he understood I had no desire to &gt;
&gt; “Look, Kai. I don’t know what game you’re playing this time, what your end game is or what you’re trying to achieve with this &gt;
&gt; myself. I tightened my hold on the folded piece of paper and made to push the door closed slightly to afford us some privacy. &gt;
&gt; much solidified that I couldn’t trust him with my issues at present and that I was still angry. I needed to deal with this &gt;
&gt; He looked genuinely worried. Who was I going to go to with this now? Who could I talk to? Damon? No. I think tonight pretty &gt;
&gt; gone dull.” 

“I’m fine,” I responded tiredly, my tone having lost of its hateful edge as I took in his concerned features. &gt;
&gt; asked, reminding me he was there, once again drawing me to the present. “Because I know she did something – my sensors haven’t &gt;
&gt; chill like I did with Stefan all those years ago or with Silas. All I knew was that I was distrustful. “You okay?” Kai &gt;
&gt; other than that—I didn’t at all know what to make of her. I hadn’t picked up anything out of whack, hadn’t felt a comparable &gt;
&gt; few seconds as she left, unsure of what to make of her or how to go about finding out. She was powerful, that much I knew, but &gt;
&gt; apologetic nod, automatically returning her pleasant smile. “It was a nice meeting you too, Freya.” I stared after her for a &gt;
&gt; my head and implored I meet her in the cafeteria the next morning. “I… yes, I’ll be sure she gets it,” I replied with an &gt;
&gt; part of Kai’s rambling. That was a relief. I reached out to take the note, rather startled when her voice made itself known in &gt;
&gt; forever grateful." I cast a glance at the woman’s outstretched hand, relieved that she appeared to have missed the important &gt;

&gt; instantly taking residence upon the candle’s wick, bright and vivid in its execution. “You’re right. It is blocking you,” I &gt;
&gt; concentrate before uttering the essential words. “Phasmatos incendia.” Magic sprung forth with effortlessness, a tiny flame &gt;
&gt; “It’s unintentional.” I bent at the waist beside him and leaned down to rest my elbows on the table, forcing myself to &gt;
&gt; I’m slightly—out of it… so, if I scorch you—“ I joked, sounding fairly serious, afraid I too might have the same problem. &gt;
&gt; it do that?’ when he insisted I try myself. “Tell me you still have what I gave you and it works.” “It’s been awhile and &gt;
&gt; near close to figuring it out as he. “I can’t use it. This damn prison world blocks it.” I opened my mouth to ask ‘why would &gt;
&gt; it in me. Why then—” I reached out to place my hand on the table, peering down at the flame, seeing my own answers and nowhere &gt;
&gt; candle he was lighting. It was lit—apparently—but I could hardly see the flame. “That’s truly weird. I have magic. I can feel &gt;
&gt; my drunken brain having strayed. I pushed away from the open fridge door, wondering back to the table to get a look at the &gt;
&gt; from the fridge when I realized he was talking – more like trying to cast a spell. “Phasmatos incendia.” I’d missed something, &gt;
&gt; here nineteen years, he could cook, did he teach himself that out of boredom or necessity? I thought to ask him, turning away &gt;
&gt; peanut butter, bread and cornflakes got old. I wondered as I peered into the fridge what Kai used to do for himself, he was &gt;
&gt; nights when my dad wasn’t around and calling Caroline well into the a.m. There was no spontaneity anymore and living off &gt;
&gt; simplicity of going to drive thru or restaurant to drink a milkshake with a friend, I missed ordering in pizza on a Friday &gt;
&gt; long time everything in the prison world lost its appeal, even something as mundane and ordinary as eating. I missed the &gt;

&gt; self-conscious alarm on my face at the mention of my name, briefly fighting the urge to flee as he greeted the blonde. Fuck! &gt;
&gt; ever have to see me again, I swear to God. Because I won’t leave without it.” I tightened my hold on the door, a look of &gt;
&gt; just me who needs it – we both do, and you know it. Please, Bonnie, just give me a little chance to explain, and you won’t &gt;
&gt; he could say something incriminating. And in true Kai fashion he pressed on as though he hadn’t heard me. “And it’s not &gt;
&gt; before I call campus security!” I snapped resentfully, forcing myself to smile at the woman, hoping to get rid of him before &gt;
&gt; to have that talk.” I darted a look to the blonde, seeing no signs of recognition on her face and gritted my teeth. “Leave &gt;
&gt; without even thinking of it, and it all will end in great destruction, which neither of us needs right now – we really have &gt;

&gt; reason to be weary. “Could I take a message and—“ I swallowed the rest of my intended words, narrowing my eyes and took a &gt;
&gt; looking for me here? She didn’t look like an official and there was a gnawing in the pit of my stomach that told me I had &gt;
&gt; appearance didn’t sit well with me. I’d been dead for over four months, hardly at Whitmore and—out of nowhere—someone comes &gt;
&gt; the ability to keep the tremor from my voice. Call it self-preservation or paranoia, but something about this woman’s &gt;
&gt; to a rave off campus with her friends. She won’t be back till much later,“ I responded, patting myself on the back for the lie and &gt;
&gt; politeness, opening my mouth to say ‘I am she’ and yet, I didn’t, thinking better of it at last minute. “Oh, um… Bonnie went &gt;
&gt; pretty lips. “I'm looking for Bonnie Bennett. Do you know where I can find her?" I returned her smile with similar &gt;
&gt; lovely looking blonde not too much older than me. "Hello,” she said, a noticeable smile of hesitancy sweeping onto her &gt;
&gt; taken me a second to identify. I stiffened, fearful of who may be on the other side of the door and rather surprised to find a &gt;
&gt; straight and bare-footedly padded over to the door, something making me pause as I reached for the doorknob, energy that had &gt;
&gt; room anyway. Not anymore. And Elena hasn’t mentioned company coming over. Unless…

I rolled off the bed, tugging my dress &gt;
&gt; my arm from my face, peering at the back of the door, briefly considering leaving whomever was there to stew. This wasn’t my &gt;
&gt; fallen into a fidgety sleep, over exhaustion easily disturbed by an unexpected knock. I flinched at the sharp noise and lifted &gt;

&gt; I pushed play, feeling slightly invigorated and giddy for what was to come. “So,” I said, taking a deep breath as I turned to &gt;
&gt; lips. “I should be thanking you.” I ambled around the table toward the CD player, removing the disc within and chose another. &gt;

&gt; statement as I stood, brushing it aside as if I hadn’t even said it. “And yet here you are. The last person I ever imagined to &gt;
&gt; enough to attempt retrieving me again—“ I continued pensively, frowning faintly at my admittance, a hand used to wave off the &gt;
&gt; need. “I thought that this birthday was to be my last, that… I’d never leave this place and that none of my friends would care &gt;
&gt; him. All I wanted was to go home, to put this place behind me and be there for one of my best friends in her worst times of &gt;
&gt; the bush to battle with my inner musings. I was done trying to figure his motives out, I was done trying to make an enemy of &gt;
&gt; “And surprisingly enough, I believe you,“ I answered, the alcohol having taken away my usual restraint or desire to beat around &gt;
&gt; knee and set the glass upon the table dismissively. “And to redeem myself at least a little, I’ll get you out of here.” &gt;
&gt; expect you to just forgive me, or trust me, but I absolutely need you to know how sincerely sorry I am.” I eased my arm off my &gt;
&gt; function. It was all very selfish. Yet, I understood it, having craved a little recognition myself over the years. “I don’t &gt;
&gt; to believe him, to realize the extent of the sacrifice he’d made for me and to give him of the redemption he now needed to &gt;
&gt; through and survive long enough to pass my powers to you, you’d at least would be back home,” he said in a tone that begged me &gt;
&gt; anyone. Not anymore. Especially not for you, Bonnie. You didn’t deserve to stay here another day. I thought if I could get &gt;
&gt; and thumb, appreciating the buzz and the last of his news. “I’ve spent eighteen years here, all alone. I didn’t want that for &gt;
&gt; refueling my earlier drunkenness. I rested my arm on my right leg, lightly swinging the empty glass between index, middle, &gt;
&gt; stubborn if not more.” I gave a small nod as if to agree and finished off my second drink. My head was swimming again, &gt;
&gt; a fragile balance and Jeremy had been caught in a foul crossfire countless times. Still. “But your boyfriend’s just as &gt;
&gt; asking how much they’d seen and found myself encompassed by an absurd hint of hurt. I understood Elena’s misgivings, magic was &gt;
&gt; of them – which was Jeremy. Elena was strongly against it, mind you.” I drank once more to keep from saying anything, from &gt;
&gt; vulnerable than I did at this very second. “I said I could probably be able to make something more corporeal out of just one &gt;
&gt; expelled a soft sigh, my cheeks warming with embarrassment and something akin to guilt. I’d never felt more exposed and more &gt;
&gt; get my shit together and just become the freaking almighty God to save you.” They saw me? They knew what I intended to do. I &gt;
&gt; see us.” ‘When was that,’ I wondered suddenly. “Damon saw the bourbon and freaked out, so they smothered me with demands to &gt;
&gt; help me—. Did that mean he’d forgiven me? That he hadn’t moved on and might still be waiting for me? “We saw you, you didn’t &gt;
&gt; sad smile played upon the corner of my mouth at the mention of Jeremy. I couldn’t believe he’d tried to come—that he tried to &gt;
&gt; the parts, so I looked into it. They all wanted to go – even Jeremy came by – and I could only transport us here as ghosts.” A &gt;
&gt; was stuck here. I took another heartier sip at the reminder, ignoring the burn as the liquid met my stomach. “But they kept &gt;
&gt; do it without the ascendant which I’d destroyed before the merge.” So it was Kai that ruined my return. He was the reason I &gt;
&gt; in his story. “When I explained it all to them, they wanted me to bring you back in return. I pointed out that I couldn’t &gt;
&gt; sorts. I kept the glass poised against my lower lip, shrugging, conceding a fleeting look of apology for my slight disruption &gt;
&gt; eradicated his tactless sense of humor or that things hadn’t changed too much. I needed a little familiarity, however out of &gt;
&gt; Damon and Elena, the nasty couple.” I chuckled softly in spite of myself, rather relieved to see that Luke hadn’t entirely &gt;
&gt; thing – wrote a letter and dropped by the boardinghouse before being on my way and out of Mystic Falls. And there they were, &gt;
&gt; overwhelmingly exhausting. “Jo didn’t want to see me – obviously – and I couldn’t find her, so I did the next best stupid &gt;
&gt; rolling my head slowly, feeling the day’s hardship settle on my shoulders like a weight. Kai hadn’t lied. He’s news was &gt;
&gt; anything, I couldn’t shake how terribly badly I felt about Luke, Liv, Jo and what I did to them.” I took a mouthful of brandy, &gt;
&gt; me—in spite of my unwillingness—and what I could get out of my grandmothers grimoire and occult books. “I couldn’t do &gt;
&gt; Luke? Or was it Luke? I’d never heard of this kind of magic, then again, I’d never heard of much other than what was taught to &gt;
&gt; thanksgiving farce. The difference this time was that his eyes no longer held that reformatory hardness. That was because of &gt;
&gt; much softer he looked and how genuinely troubled. Kai adorned a similar look of hurt while talking about his father during his &gt;
&gt; at once as it happened to me after the merge. “I tilted my head a tad as if seeing him for the first time, registering how &gt;
&gt; like in Alien movie. I mean, I never thought there could be such a storm of overwhelmingly painful feelings attacking you all &gt;
&gt; remorse or caring for others, and now it’s a madhouse inside of me. I feel like all these feelings are busting me from within, &gt;
&gt; part of me that drives me nuts.” He continued to drink. And heavily so. “I was so okay with not being burdened by guilt or &gt;
&gt; said otherwise. “I knew the other twin’s traits can be passed to the surviving one. I just wasn’t prepared for this whole &gt;
&gt; facetious or gleeful maliciousness at a job well done. He’d come out on top after all, that’s what Kai wanted and yet his face &gt;
&gt; she’d seemed very close to her brother, very protective. “In a way, so did I.” I noticed that his voice didn’t have a hint of &gt;
&gt; moment, so I went for it since he insisted. And – as you can see – he lost it.” I could only imagine how Liv must be feeling, &gt;
&gt; ‘cause, come on, we’re not twins – and he said we’re still one blood and one age. Technically. I had no other choice at the &gt;
&gt; right knee, a hand still firmly secured around it while I listened. “He didn’t care about the consequences – &gt;
&gt; knocked her out and demanded to merge with me instead.” I set the bottle back down, sat back and rested the glass upon my &gt;
&gt; the Parker Family and what I imagined he sought to do a second time around. “When we were about to merge, Luke showed up, &gt;
&gt; bleeding. The parker family was good-looking. And for a second—while I concentrated on his deceptively handsome face—I pitied &gt;
&gt; woman to memory, having seen the many pictures littered around his family home when I hunted for a first aid kit to stave the &gt;
&gt; they wanted me to suck the blood’s magical effect out of the sheriff – which I did and then got to Jo.” I recalled the young &gt;
&gt; tongue, lowering my left leg to the floor, stretching forward to claim the cognac for a moment and to refill my glass. “So &gt;
&gt; went wrong and her mom’s cancer went on multiplying by the second.” Oh, God. I tipped what was left of the brandy onto my &gt;
&gt; I had. “So Caroline decided, what the hey, she’s an all-powerful vampire, and her blood’s the answer to everything. Well, that &gt;
&gt; flamboyant optimism. “See, her mom has cancer, fourth stage, inoperable.” I frowned, convinced I’d misheard him – and hopeful &gt;
&gt; mention of Caroline’s name, my heart skipping a beat with a longing need to see her. I missed her sunny smile and her &gt;
&gt; had a perfect idea to make me help undo a stupid trick your pal Caroline pulled for her mom.” I stopped drinking at the &gt;
&gt; hadn’t removed the glass from my mouth, still drinking, feeling a soft hum take a hold of my body. “And then your buddy Damon &gt;
&gt; my twin sister, Jo. Your pesky friends tried to stop me, knocked me out and kept me that way until the magic seeped out.” I &gt;
&gt; With the magical barrier down, had it been that easy for them to forgo attempting to rescue me again? “Then I went to search for &gt;
&gt; everything that happened, at least that would have stayed as a constant reminder about where I was. That was two months ago. &gt;
&gt; up what had literally threatened to rip me apart as dozens of dead travelers accosted me. I had hoped—selfishly—that amidst &gt;
&gt; getting my fix.” I took another large gulp at hearing how easy it was to eradicate my former suffering, how easily Kai sucked &gt;
&gt; Basically, they gave me a boost I couldn’t hope for. And yeah, your home town’s back to normal again – I fixed it while &gt;
&gt; attacked me, chained be up – guess where? – on the Mystic Falls’ side. With all that travelers’ magic soaking the ground. &gt;
&gt; taste in my mouth and the hatred that enclosed around my heart like a steely vice. “Your Pinky and Brain, Damon and Alaric, &gt;
&gt; sabotaged my freedom and aided in my increasing insanity in this place? I took another gulp, trying to will away the bitter &gt;
&gt; running.” Liv pulled them out? Did that mean Kai was the reason I didn’t make it out the first time? He was the one that &gt;
&gt; met Damon and Elena right after Liv pulled them out from here – without you – because they all heard I was out and went &gt;
&gt; nervousness as I raised the glass to my lips to take a gulp. “After I left you and got back to the world we both call home, I &gt;
&gt; inside my mind. So I better start at the beginning.” I braced myself in fear of what he had to say, inhaling softly with &gt;
&gt; them. “Well… There’s overwhelmingly much to tell – or at least it feels that way – I mean, it wears me down just clustered &gt;
&gt; onto the chair, bracing my knees against the edge of the table for support, observing him and his newfound mannerisms over &gt;
&gt; was acting almost as if he’d returned from a lengthy vacation. I took a hold of my cognac and sat back, raising my booted feet &gt;
&gt; and refilled his mug to heat his tea. “Now we’re talking,” he said and grinned before moving to take a seat across from me. He &gt;
&gt; in my wildest dreams thought I’d see him again. Or anyone for that matter. He strolled toward the kettle as it clicked off &gt;
&gt; Kai, how to process everything that happened in the last four hours or the fact that we were on a friendlier base. I hadn’t, &gt;
&gt; small awkward smile littered with evident strain as a thank you as he fulfilled my mute request. I wasn’t sure how to react to &gt;

&gt; conversationally. I set it down in front of me, tapping at the side of the glass in gesture he pour. The pleasantries were &gt;
&gt; stretching across the table to claim a glass. “How’s the tea? I-I err… wasn’t sure if you took sugar or not,” I added &gt;
&gt; Kai gain from drugging you?’ I smiled to myself, lightly shaking my head to clear it of the irrational thought before &gt;
&gt; internally, watching his features for even a hint of the bloodthirsty jester I knew he could be. ‘You’re paranoid. What could &gt;
