@aleceberhardt WE'RE JOXXX GODDAMMIT
I've never really
Felt ashamed to be queer
And I'm suddenly
Really sorry
Why?
does anyone want any seroquel
I have at least 200
@veryrarefriend I guess better safe than sorry
@veryrarefriend 
1.) r*pe
2.) hate yourself a feel hopeless
3.) get fucked over

[using an asterisk feel right for some reason ... Hm]
@veryrarefriend word
I've def said it to people
only three things I can think of now are:
SUBMIT TO EVERYTHING
seems fucked
Could be completely wrong
Bc this is based on a person who has not experienced this
wonder if 'get fcked' as an expletive relates to r*pe at all
i think it is abt getting in a fcked mental state as is my experience and label
this could be the consumer electronics talking but THIS IS ALL FUCKING GARBAGE YOU FUCK TASTE IT
seems weird that sometimes I have to wait for a bad thing to happen to me in order to express righteous anger
when am I allowed to be outwardly and righteously angry
when am I allowed to be an angry vegan

i don't play guitar and i never wear orange

just gonna throw out that i probably never gave you the apology that you deserve

@sunshineonvenus /and/ the last time I presented feminine in that space I was sexually harassed - we played well, I don't know....
@sunshineonvenus it's just that my identity is being policed Bc I was not 'presenting femininely' - maybe then they'd kno I'm not a boy.
@sunshineonvenus there is an aspect of confrontation in our performances - in a sense I can understand where these people were coming from
Played a show and were called 'hyper masculine' and I'm very upset. I don't even know what to do abt this.

PS: want to start band called 'kill me' but not in the style of the band I described Want 2 b described as 'loud,' 'fun,' &amp; 'rly good live'
EDIT: 'gang of one' started as a cover band
'the protectorate'-been together since high school hence the only-okay-name. 80s-hardcore w 'blast-beats'. Actually p good.
'gang of one'-thinly veiled 'rancid' ripoff
'deja rule'-DIY punx w melodic gangvox Three chord w humorous 'noise-sections' (non diatonic powerchords) List 'sonic youth' as an influence
'gluegun' - 'choking victim' vox over synth a la a mix of late-'aquabats'&amp; 'the locust') [i kno, I kno]. 'mathy'-tho they reject this label
'kill me' - midwest emo w/ occasional 'iwrotehaikus...' vox over slowed down chords from pre-chorus, extensive use of samples
Band name: 'gluegun'
Band name: 'kill me'
