Come on pack
@Martinswagr hilarious episode
I wish it was raining, that would make staying inside much less disgusting than this beautiful weather 
*phone rings*

Me: "It's a telemarketer"

Dad: "Good, I feel like being mean!"
@Martinswagr I meant of you're going to take a WR how can it not be strong
@Martinswagr strong is also a WR
DGB has a lot of upside, and I like the height, but damn I would have like Strong #DraftDay2 #TitansDraft
Damn @TennesseeTitans how can you go WR and leave Strong on the board? #poordecision
@TennesseeTitans waste no time on this pick, let's see how it plays out #DraftDay2
OK here we go @TennesseeTitans #DraftDay2 2.0
Donovan McNabb?? Lmao @SportsCenter #nottop10
Definitely not mad about this @TennesseeTitans  
Plot twist @TennesseeTitans trade the pick #DraftDay2
Here we go @TennesseeTitans on the clock for round 2.  Would love Collins or strong #DraftDay2
I will forever be grateful that my company allows me to come to work wearing shorts, flip flops, a long sleeve tee and a hat #casualeveryday
Finally #DraftDay
Damn Williams falls again #DraftDay
How can you take fowler over Williams tho? #DraftDay
I am very happy and optimistic about this @TennesseeTitans #DraftDay

@TennesseeTitans select: 

Marcus Mariota, QB, Oregon

#NFLDraft 
Oh boy here we go @TennesseeTitans #DraftDay

#TitansDraft
Please God don't let @TennesseeTitans  screw this up #faith #DraftDay

@scirto89 not without you between the pipes ;)
@scirto89 of I had to pick I'd go NJ with Pit as my #2
@scirto89 lol almost ended up at a sabers game a few months back
@scirto89 I consider myself a supporter of Pit and NJ  but I don't have the attention span to follow it closely enough to call myself a fan
I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I love watching hockey
@El_MATTador11 @C_Armstrong3 @amandatash @duckiemary @laureneversley one month later...
YYEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS #GameofThrones
Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy #GameofThrones

This is killing me...
Bo Ryan isn't wrong tho
Grayson Allen reminds me of the nerdy kid on the team who hits the big shot at the end of the movie to win the game off the bench
Ugly ass hats doe
Oh yeah, it's Masters week #teamrickie
Is it college football season yet?
'Cuse 2016
And they did it pretty much without Okafor
That's the shot you take?
Frank with ice in the veins
2 no call charges and 2 OBs missed...
Winslow OB again...this is out of control
Winslow OB...man
Winslow with another uncalled charge
At half coach K must have pulled some Liam Neeson shit on these refs #horrible
Definitely a charge
Frank. The. TANK
Hayes is a bigger problem
Allen is a problem
Heat check
Dunk that...
JJ repping Wisconsin, game over
In all honesty though I have so much respect for coach K.  35 seasons and a class act #stillbadgernation #bandwagonbadgerfan

Listening to Billy Joel pretending to be at the concert like the rest of my family #homealone
I'm stuck at the crossroads of morally, intensly, hating everyone that owns a selfie stick and secretly wishing I owned a selfie stick
Just want to point out that the three games I picked wrong were lost by a combined 3 points (that's one point each)...I hate match madness
By a combined total of 2 points, my bracket has been annihilated.  But two 14s winning is spectacular #MarchMadness
@pband_LELLY game cast is an office workers best friend
. @pband_LELLY I have ND winning, that was a very scary hour

Registered for the #boilermaker let's get it #2015k
Wouldn't mind seeing the @TennesseeTitans pursue Trent Richardson #NFLFreeAgency
Wore a @TennesseeTitans hoodie today hoping it would give off some good free agency vibes, was not disappointed 
Damn.  Eagles going to be a problem this year...Colts and Bills also playoff bound IMO.  #NFLFreeAgency #wakeuptitans

I laugh every single time
Well, it looks like the @Colts are going to be winning the AFC South for a few more years...what a time to be a @TennesseeTitans fan...
Watt, Harper, others 'report' fake trades involving characters from sports movies &amp; TV 
Holy cow @JJWatt @Bharper3407 and @TJ_Yates win the day #mightyducks #airbud #tradingblock

The joys of a @TennesseeTitans fan during free agency #ticktock
@dangelo1236 almost so bad

Let's all just appreciate how many movies are the direct result of an snl skit. #GOAT #SNL40
In case anyone ever doubted my ability to tell the future 
Haven't been this excited for TV in a long time #SNL40
Made an instagram like 2 years ago and never used it, decided to dust it off

I wish vine was still relevant
@McDonalds I'd be more in the mood for a parade if they actually had them

Real talk I wish the corporate world had an intramural league
Seriously though, its been one day and I find that I check the internet for a #tWoW release date bi-hourly #noavail
I finished "A Dance With Dragons" yesterday and I already feel a void. I feel so bad for anyone who has been with this series from the start
Last night I walked into a push door because my millennial mind just assumed it would be automatic #whathaveIbecome
Life doesn't give me lemons anymore...not after what happened last time
My enjoyment of @rainnwilson and all that he does has led me to #blackstrom ...let's see how this goes
The NFL, where players get crucified if they say the wrong thing to the media,but when a player decides to focus on the game they get fined
I dream of a world where vegetables taste like cookies and pizza is the healthiest thing you can eat

Playing Madden online up 42-0 with 16 seconds left...Internet shits the bed and I get a loss #furious
@Martinswagr it really wouldn't be hard for a tackle to get enough of him so he doesn't land cleanly
@Martinswagr tackle could stand up lol or do a drop step (pass protection scheme)...most simply a hard count cadance to throw off the timing
@Martinswagr more so I would think more teams would practice defending it...incredibly hard to do it legally
@Martinswagr 
Yo Chancellor is the truth

@Martinswagr YOU'RE A JOKE
The @TennesseeTitans reminding me that there was once a good time to be a titans fan by tweeting the music city miracle like it was live
AND if you needed more proof, use your last skip and I GUARANTEE that the next song will be worse...now you're stuck
wanting a specific song on Pandora but the station just wont play it is all the proof that I need that machines are conspiring against us
"I thought it would be funny" is pretty much why I do anything ever

Paddle your own canoe
I just realized that after all of this controversy, @Sony is going to make a hit ton of money when they finally release #TheInterview #hype
We should hack the North Korean communication system so that #TheInterview is the only thing anyone there can see, #HungerGamesStyle #beetee
Seriously, if NK said "we're going to do some stuff if you ever sing the national anthem again" at this point I think @espn would ban it
This isn't the America I remember... 
9:57AM and I've already gotten 5 emails about the snacks (cookies, fudge, etc) that people have brought into the office today #bulkingseason

Really disappointing news that @SonyPictures is canceling the release of #TheInterview Think of all the hard work that went into it..#wasted

What happened in Ferguson last night makes me sick. Innocent Mom and Pop shops burned to the ground in the name of "justice"...seems right.
Seriously, I dont know enough to have an opinion of innocent or guilty...but I know damn well that lighting a cop car on fire is a bad thing
In 50 years I will be able to tell my grandkids about where I was when I heard the verdict..this is a dark chapter in America's history book
@dangelo1236 I needed one more 3 yard catch from stills or another fg from tucker...foresett ruined my season with that last td

Classic romo
3 Vick fumbles.   #bringbacktebow
Are the jets even a real team? This is a joke
@Martinswagr god damn it
God damn it, who uses Fullbacks anymore anyways
Although I have to thank him because I have Dixon in fantasy and a td would be clutch right now
Lol Watkins.  Only way that would have been funnier would be if he fumbled too.  Nearly a vintage DJax play
Ill never understand my own mind. One minute Im questioning the idea of consciousness and the next Im overly amused by the Pipes Screensaver
I am completely appalled by the reactive nature of our society. You should make choices because YOU think its right. #beyourownperson
Only 9:30 and it already feels like quitting time
Some pretty awful officiating in this game if you ask me
Part of me wants to make an instagram, but the rest of me knows I'll never forgive myself
Happy Birthday to the dude @Martinswagr #deuces

@CLabattaglia still debating starting that ish
3 skits in and this SNL rules.  Hader killing it and Davidson out in force.  Glad they know talent when they see it. #kidsgotjokes

To add some context to my last tweet this debate was sparked by the receipt of super hero themed band aids at the office flu clinic #grownup
Currently involved in a heated debate at my adult place of work as to whether iron man or spiderman is the better super hero #spidey

knew I picked the right guy #fowlernation #USA
Happy Monday Jets Nation #lmao

@Martinswagr @ComplexMag with proper coaching the dude would be dangerous, would love to see him under chip kelly
@0hTheGrandeur and Im sure there would be a reason behind that stabbing
@Martinswagr @ComplexMag 1-1 in playoffs and I believe 8-6 regular season, dude has as much playoff success as matty ice
@Martinswagr @ComplexMag picked him last year and almost did it again, dude needs a shot
I just drafted my team for ESPN Fantasy Football -- check it out and tell me what you think

@KingJames back to Cleveland!  Not a fan of any NBA team myself but I love Lebron and I can't wait to watch him with Wiggins and Kyrie
@bodybyallen @lids4hats @KingJames less public that way

At work for 5 minutes and spilled coffee down my white shorts
I seriously can't wait to watch the 4 Thompsons have some fun with the #Iroquoisnationals

@qanyewest feet have to be set before the shooter enters the shooting motion...if you think he was there before he took off you're drunk
@DTroiano33 I deserve this...but you whole heartedly know that was a block
@qanyewest you're joking right?
Duke fans going to act like they actually won this game...you know with your whole heart without the refs you lose
Not a chance that is a charge
That is absolutely terrible
