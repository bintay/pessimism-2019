@LamyaVEVO same here, but let's look at the bright side, it's short
I like people who seem to be as messed up as I am
seriously people I don't bite
you're probably as bored as I am.

kik: gbinghaith
or wait we are going to have final exams during ramadan sigh
Ramadan is about a month away &amp; I feel like we won't see the sun for the whole month
@BiteSizeNawar 
Sigh is there anything worse than being haunted by a thought or an idea and not having anyone you trust enough to talk to about it
@Patiimaa because we arabs use numbers when we chat <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Samleficent @shawaki_ that's because it's impossible according to physics (I'm good at parties)
@floralsalama yeah I get what you're saying, but my point is that I don't mind people who want to be popular, as long as they hurt no one
@floralsalama what I consider as an "attention seeker" is someone who hurts others for attention's sake
I like to have a long conversation with someone online without making it become a personal conversation
I have to study for 2 midterm tests and work on a research that's due tomorrow, great
@Damnaw wait is that doge
I like coffee, I like tea, and I like herbal teas. I don't consider myself as a "coffee person" nor a "tea person".
@Sara_JE_ I'm not like you but I think that they'll make me cry and I'll still like them
@Sara_JE_ I know right
@floralsalama why do it now when you can do it tomorrow
@AstroAthene please, it's Friday
seriously guys I'm supposed to be studying algebra give me an excuse to procrastinate
@HindAlowais_ no that's not how
say "hi".

kik: gbinghaith
@AstroAthene wow alyazia wow
I'm spending my day studying algebra what a great thing to do on Friday
@AstroAthene nein
natural selection at its finest  
@AstroAthene NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN NEIN
I don't use ask.fm because I don't like to be asked weird questions by an anonymous interviewer
I don't usually feel like having a chat with anyone but I feel like I want to have a chat with someone tonight
People should start looking at obesity as a health issue not as a cosmetic one
@Esrius there are things that were better and things that were worse, I can't say that it was
@ThisIzMyDesign I wonder what's coming next, this generation of kids use tablets before they can talk
@ThisIzMyDesign they deserve honor and respect for surviving without wifi
@ThisIzMyDesign I weren't serious when I tweeted it. And yes, they were much stronger and healthier because they were more physically active
Seriously though it's 38 celsuis and it was 40+ earlier in the morning
Whenever you feel sad, remember that your ancestors have survived this climate without air conditioning
whether I spend my whole life alone or spend my whole life around people both scenarios are equally bad
@Damnaw studying algebra is more fun than socializing am I right
It's Friday and I have no book to read and no tv show to watch. I guess I'll spend my day studying for the midterms.
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ I'd like to see Holden showing his hatred of movies in a movie
@walix85 oh I'm on season 2
@walix85 I have 2 episodes left <NEUTRAL FACE>
@walix85 I have just watched episode 11 and I was watching the show since 6:00 AM today
@walix85 I still didn't watch the whole 2nd season but the show keeps getting better and better every episode
@walix85 I find Will Graham way more likeable, he's more "human".
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie @Damnaw I thought you woke up with a mention from me, and it's something
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ @Damnaw wow I woke up with 20+ interactions
@Sara_JE_ and I noticed that this is her only role in the show
@Sara_JE_ they could've made a better character from Alana Bloom I feel like she's involved in nothing but the romance
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ I did, why
@Sara_JE_ he's a cool character, but I don't really "like" him. It's like I feel good when things turn against him.
I really like Hannibal, the TV show, but I don't find any of the characters to be "likeable". Except for Will Graham.
@ThisIzMyDesign @iotacist in situations like these, we need freedom of speech. It shouldn't be used as an excuse for insults and hate
@ThisIzMyDesign @iotacist Galileo was only put under house arrest, while Giordano Bruno was sentenced to death by burning
@DamnUseless I'm thinking about reading it during the summer vacation, I hope it's good
@iotacist @ThisIzMyDesign many scientists in the past were tortured and burned for their discoveries, that's when we need "free speech"
"Free speech" 
@Damnaw I didn't have any other example, and I believe that I made my point clear
I feel like taking pictures of them to show them that they seem to be butthurt people who're about to cry
It's funny when people are yelling and all to express their anger at someone and think that they look tough while doing it
I'm actually quite organized when it comes to taking notes or writing in general, but my handwriting is shit
A never ending struggle of trying to make sense of reality and existence
I am "professionally curious" about her
I'm actually more excited for the Warcraft movie than the Stars Wars movie
You never know the reason of their depression. You never know what's making them the way they are.
People who make fun of other people for being depressed deserve a slow and painful death
@floralsalama it is, I guess
I noticed that "DM games" have suddenly disappeared from Twitter. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
@AstroAthene @Saldurihim على أساس ان هو اللي يستحق الاحترام <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'm very proud of being a citizen of the United Arab Emirates. A small new country with great achievements.

#MBRSpaceC…

They started with …
How do people like Ahlam and Hala Al Turk? They irritate the fuck out of me.
@Sara_JE_ yeah, what do I know about life
@Sara_JE_ I thought that you were a university student &amp; I thought that you didn't speak Arabic
@AstroAthene I'm doing good in art so (I don't take art)
@AstroAthene why are you :(
My grades are shit in all subjects except for physics and math, Is it normal
@iFabrie @majestigifs thank god for utorrent and the pirate bay
I swear to god I feel like cutting throats
I hate to be this kind of person, but I really hate clingy people. They annoy the fuck out of me.
@AstroAthene but there's a level of existential frustration that'll stop you from being happy
@AstroAthene you're way too optimistic and happy to be "kinda the same" -sobs-
@AstroAthene I was born existentially frustrated
Words to live by. Marcus Aurelius. 
@AstroAthene it's cute that you think that this is just the beginning of my existential crisis
"Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good."
Do other people ever wonder why do they exist and what is their purpose here
…

"Socrates apparently means that death is a cure for the ills of life."
Socrates' last words: "Crito, we owe a rooster to Asclepius. Please, don't forget to pay the debt."
@ThisIzMyDesign yes, I believe. Other apps and website worked fine. I'm not sure, though.
Twitter was down for the past few hours because there was some kind of a problem with etisalat. (du is the master race)
@rihabthegreat this explains it. It's working for du, but not for etisalat.
@rihabthegreat may I ask, you have etisalat or du as your service provider?
@rihabthegreat really? maybe it's for everyone, not just us. This might explain why my timeline is dead
Twitter isn't working when I'm on our wifi, not via my phone nor via the laptop. It works fine when I use the cellular data, though.
@AstroAthene look at the bright side, you're home
@AstroAthene yeah 4 actually
@AstroAthene I have midterm exams next week, we are not even
@AstroAthene lucky you, I'm suffering here and I'll have a physics test after  about 30 minutes
@AstroAthene I am and I'm not crying
@AstroAthene aren't you supposed to be at school
@Damnaw @iFabrie @Sara_JE_ @AstroAthene I wonder how it feels to be 3bdelrahman in this conversation
@ThisIzMyDesign I'm not black &amp; white okay -wipes his tears-
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ @AstroAthene it's absolutely not about you 3bdelrahman
@Sara_JE_ @AstroAthene @iFabrie when I knew that he was a guy it was like one of my "my whole life was a lie" moments
@ThisIzMyDesign what made you think that I'm black &amp; white
@ThisIzMyDesign I like what you said, I really do, but that's not what I meant. I didn't mean that the world is a bad place or anything.
@floralsalama I like to believe that too, to be honest
I wonder if I see the world from a different perspective or if every person believes that he sees the world from a different perspective
@Damnaw I feel like cutting your throat. Thrice.
@Damnaw I'm reading about psychotic serial killers and trying to discover ways to please satan now
@Damnaw I was a kid. I was innocent and all. <PENSIVE FACE>
I can't believe that I still have it. I drew this when I was a child, somewhere between 2002-2004. 
@Damnaw what about it
@marwuh attachment leads to disappoint, it's as simple as that
If you can't enjoy your time alone you're a boring person
@iotacist have a mug of coffee and bang your head 3 times on the nearest wall. If it didn't work, repeat.
Whatsapp is weird because it's the only app I have where people use "<SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL><SPLASHING SWEAT SYMBOL>" for water or rain
@AstroAthene you suppose that means that it's not true
@AstroAthene that happened by chance
@AstroAthene that has nothing to do with being a detective
@AstroAthene you'll grow up to be a great hacker, or even an assassin, alyazia
@AstroAthene you're not skilled enough alyazia, don't put yourself at risk of being expelled
@Sara_JE_ one of my classmates have kept talking to her and all while my other classmate opened her laptop and copied it sneakily
@Sara_JE_ you had them in a usb?
@asmatine of course I'm going to study from it it's like downloading pirated movies
@asmatine I'm innocent I was just a witness
God bless my classmates. They've copied our midterm exam from the teacher's laptop and they have put it in a usb.
@AstroAthene a psychotic philosopher
May the 4th be with you all
We are nothing but a part of the universe that have grown aware of itself.
I can't wait for Wednesday. The day when the facts about the UAE Mars mission going to be revealed on public.
It's sad that what's normal for us human beings nowadays is different than what's natural for us
"ذو العَقلِ يَشقَى في النّعيمِ بعَقْلِهِ وَأخو الجَهالَةِ في الشّقاوَةِ يَنعَمُ."
I have midterms next week and I have a test every day of this week. I feel like burning the place I'm in.
@iFabrie god bless that anonymous though
@iFabrie if I found it out by myself would that prove that I have a good taste
@iFabrie what does this have to do with taste
@iFabrie the person who made me watch the show is some anonymous on ask.fm
@iFabrie hola amigo
I can't believe that I said I didn't like hannibal. I changed my mind after watching the rest of the season.
@AstroAthene I'm going to watch some more episodes because I have nothing else to do, and I hope it does get better
@Sara_JE_ the story was cool, but didn't find it that engaging. I'm still watching the whole season, though.
I watched the first 3 episodes of hannibal and I didn't really like it much for some reason. I didn't find it engaging.
The fact that many species are at risk of extinction because of human activity is just awful
@Damnaw yars, I like to share positive thoughts every now and then
@AishaAlOwais welcome back
@AstroAthene finally, you're back
"The belief that the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in humans."

Ordinary people are making an effort to "stand out" while people who are different are making an effort to "fit in"

"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."
I am existentially frustrated
It's Thursday. A great day to suffer from a sore throat.
How stupid should a person be to assume that someone is pretentious for trying to make a better person out of himself
I sometimes say stuff as a joke or in a way that makes it seem that I'm exaggerating while I actually really mean what I say
I watched the latest episode of every interesting tv show I know and I read every book I have. I'm going to have a depressing weekend.
I can't understand why most people hate physics and math. They're like the only interesting subjects we take in school.
"Internet people" seem to be better than the people we know in real life. I believe that's because we don't know each other well enough here
I hate to complain about society (although I always do), but this irritates the hell out of me.
I can't understand people. They tend to respect the rudest of all and they consider the most polite ones as weak.
I feel like burning this hell of a school
I finally watched the latest episode of The Blacklist. This show is too damn good, it's very underrated.
I feel like an asshole for saying it, but going out on public without taking a shower for more than 8 hours should be illegal
If you smell bad on public I might just throw you in a washing machine
@shawaki_ @HessaAG_ @shahadalsaffar_ I'll join and let's call it a raid
@fxcthesystem @Sara_JE_ actually every single human being fakes an awful  lot
I don't understand parents who get their little kids tablets and phones. It's bad for both their physical and mental health.
I remember getting a one-year gym membership and only attending once or twice
I'm wondering if people on Twitter really do drugs and all or if they only say it as a joke
@asmatine that's not very "friendly" though
friendly reminder: every day, we are one day closer to the day we die
@G4MERGUY @youthsin @shiboukitten everything is a, if you're brave enough
@Sara_JE_ I don't understand the concept of the "we" here, but well, I don't mind watching a movie every week
@Sara_JE_ that's a little bit way too much
If the unlikely scenario of me being in a relationship have become true, we'll annually have disney, Star Wars and LOTR marathons
I don't believe that the God who gave me reason will punish me eternally for using it
When I'll be like 50, I'll probably be living in a large ceramic jar with nothing but some food and papers in the middle of nowhere
That's why we rarely see english translations of his works. Unlike Rumi and Omar Khayyam,
It's nearly impossible to translate Al Motanabbi's poems without making them lose most of their meaning
"إنّ السّلاحَ جَميعُ النّاسِ تَحْمِلُهُ وَلَيسَ كلُّ ذواتِ المِخْلَبِ السَّبُعُ."
And don't tell me that nobody does, that's like the most popular misapprehension
Nothing irritates me as much as people who mistake rudeness for toughness and kindness for weakness
I don't mean you guys, I mean those who tweet in a "poem" format, and things like that.
Some people have a talent of tweeting something silly and meaningless in a way that makes it seem profound
"The gods envy us. They envy us because we’re mortal,because any moment may be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we’re doomed."
It's funny how most of us used to fear death and now we find the thought of death very satisfying
I once made a joke in class and everybody laughed, sarcastically, including the teacher. That's why I retired.
@Lujaain94 yeah, but I meant most of the debates we see here on the Internet. They usually turn into arguments.
@shawaki_ most people don't like to admit that the other person is right, even if they're convinced
Tomorrow I'll work on discovering the ultimate theory and now I'll watch tv shows all night and then sleep
I really can't understand debates. It's as if the other person will change his opinion after a debate.
The UAE is a small country that have achieved what no other Arab country have achieved. This is making me very proud to be an Emirati.
ὁ κόσμος ἀλλοίωσις, ὁ βίος ὑπόληψις. The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.
Many people avoid thinking about certain things fearing the "consequence" of their thinking
"To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me." - Isaac Newton
That's our reality. But thank god that our nature prohibit most of us from seeing it from this perspective.
Clueless, trying to discover what you are, and where you are, and what's your purpose here
Imagine yourself waking up, out of nowhere, in a strange body in a stranger world
"ونحنُ أناسٌ لا توسـُّط بيننا لنا الصدر دون العالمين أو القبر."
And not just that, it's one of the few venomous mammals.
I wonder how does it feel like to be a duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed platypus
@ThisIzMyDesign I did report him. I had no idea that it was about this guy. I thought it was about that "hamdanium" dude.
@ThisIzMyDesign oh, well. I've mistaken. He's the ones who's doing it for attention.
@ThisIzMyDesign I didn't even read your tweets. What I saw on my timeline was screenshots of the tweets and people insulting the guy.
If I did or said something that wasn't right, I will really appreciate it if someone talked to me about it. Privately.
It's funny how some people just go with the flow, without caring about the rightfulness of their words or actions
And that doesn't mean that shaming them is right.
I can't respect anyone who make rape jokes, racist jokes, or jokes about topics that shouldn't be joked about
@M7mdbinkalban I will not, I don't know them and I have no business with them whatsoever
@youthsin just think about it, if your intention is to do good, it's better to contact them privately instead of shaming them.
@M7mdbinkalban I do not follow any of those. I can't contact them privately.
@youthsin I am serious as hell. Don't misunderstand me, though, I'm not saying that rape jokes are in any way justified
Shaming someone on social media is even worse in my opinion, because that offends them PERSONALLY.
Which isn't the right thing to do. The right thing to do is to talk to them about it. Privately.
It's funny that whenever someone here tweets something horribly wrong, others take the chance to shame him for the sake of being retweeted
@Sara_JE_ it's not that the bullying and all is justified, what I meant is that it's a matter of health.
@floralsalama nobody should be happy with morbid obesity, and this is a matter of health.
ﻭﻧﺤﻦ أﻧﺎﺱ ﻻ ﺗﻮﺳﻂ عندنا    ﻟﻨﺎ ﺍﻟﺼﺪﺭ ﺩﻭﻥ ﺍﻟﻌﺎﻟﻤﻴﻦ أﻭ ﺍﻟﻘﺒﺮ

The idea that the functions of the most complex known object in the universe can be measured by taking an iq test is "odd"
I never took an iq test and I'm not even interested.

I don't take IQ levels seriously. Einstein's, Picassos's and Gandhi's genius can't be measured by the same test.
People who still have family gatherings are blessed, really.
Is there anything we can be certain about in this world other than change and death?
"We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end."
@mutedpoem it's good, but it's not "that" good. It's worth the watch, though.
I'm supposed to be that cold ass dude with no feelings and all but dammit
God, I've never been obsessed with a person as much as I'm obsessed with that person now. And I really don't like it.
If I was ever in a relationship I would look like some kind of sick joke
I just hope that nobody ever gets to know me well enough.
I don't think that I'm anti-social. I just prefer being alone than being around lame people who care about lame things.
@mutedpoem @AstroAthene you've taken "cool" into a whole new level
@AstroAthene I'm not saying that I'm cool or anything, but I didn't wear my seatbelt once
People who make a huge effort to appear cool make me laugh.
@AstroAthene I can't see the difference between these two. They both require an effort and make me end up with sore muscles
@AstroAthene I tried, and I broke my toe
"Leaving out the third case: both, a philosopher." - Fredrick Nietzsche  
@AstroAthene @intersomnious that's "how" 
I don't know if I should stay with the bunch of strangers I'm stuck with here or get a life and live it alone
The last time I interacted with anyone I follow was 2 days ago. Twitter is fun.
@sandwiched_ yeah and that's what I'm doing
When I see a guy flirting with someone I like 
They're like the time of the week where I have nothing to do but overthink about reality and the purpose of life
I don't like weekends, to be honest. I never liked them.
I didn't like you for having a good taste on what to copy
I hate it when I start liking someone from Twitter and then realizing that 95% of their tweets are copied from another source
It's funny that I had this account since 2012 and I still don't know anyone here personally.
Seriously, I can't understand some people's mentality.
Convince me that I'm going to suffer eternally on the afterlife for talking to someone from the opposite sex
I'm preparing myself some iced coffee for tomorrow because I feel like I always need some caffeine when I'm at school
@LilDeer_ yeah, it is
If I ever become a father I'll fill my children's heads with fairytales
In my opinion, it's not about how successful you are, it's about the effort you make.
I hate to be this kind of guy, but I had the urge of sharing it.
I really appreciate the existence of the few intelligent people who actually "think" in our idiotic brainwashed society.
I don't have close friends, I just happen to know a lot of people
It's based on Carmina Burana, a manuscript written on the year 1230

@Damnaw @Gay_salad <DANCER> 
Silent people usually have the most to say
I'm having an existential crisis from now, I wonder how will I be when I'll be like 50 or something
I'm fascinated by the fact that we exist
It's like give a man a mask and he'll speak what's really on his mind
It's ironic that when someone hides his identity, he feels better with being himself.
@coolka_ no, he says that he'll be back but he's too lazy to type his long password, idk
@coolka_ he left without a good-bye
@shawaki_ I am really glad, but it makes me feel like a stranger somehow, lol
I wonder what made me follow the strangers I'm following lmao
I don't know anyone here on Twitter personally. How am I supposed to feel about this?
The time we have to clear the fog from our view on the world is very limited.
What I'm saying makes sense if you try hard enough to make sense of it
I don't even know what to expect from myself
I don't know if I underestimate myself or if I'm overestimating myself by saying that I underestimate myself
Some of the greatest people had to die without being remembered
@alanoodak it does taste different
I like to eat locally grown fruits and vegetables
The other 29% hide the fact that they do 
let's look at the bright side and say that tomorrow's math test is cancelled, which is great
I tried to imagine the worst case scenario but life proved to me that it can be worse
Having oatmeal for breakfast makes me feel good for the rest of the day
@Sara_JE_ I did listen to 6th symphony and moonlight sonata last night, but not that Vivaldi one
what's with me and classical music tonight
I feel like listening to Beethoven all night until I feel like sleeping
@walix85 people who confuse "your" and "you're" are even worst
I fell in love with her personality from first sight
@Damnaw @Marwantted poop on the pigeon to show dominance
Being in public without taking a shower or brushing your teeth for more than 8 hours should be punishable by law
@mutedpoem dw you'll soon reach the point that it will not even bother you
I still have a telescope I got 2 years ago and I still didn't take it out of the box because it's too precious
Twitter have become boring. I'm ready to pay the awesome people here just for tweeting more.
I can be attractive if I want to but I must get a haircut and all and workout for a few months, which is exhausting
I point out the obvious because reflecting on it makes it fascinating, if this makes any sense.
Everything in the universe has a beginning and an end. Even the universe itself.
perks of being unattractive: people like you from what you really are and not from what you appear to be
Never hate on someone for being different. Or thinking differently.
It's safe to say that The Blacklist is way more interesting than Breaking Bad

@AstroAthene @shawaki_ when I give a speech, I sound like socrates giving the "apology", I have nothing to worry about
@AstroAthene @shawaki_ I will be there too, I'll volunteer to give a speech about quantum mechanics although I understand nothing about it
@AstroAthene @shawaki_ I did check the website, but where is it going to be held and how can I get tickets or anything
@AstroAthene @shawaki_ I know but when where how and who and what
@AstroAthene @shawaki_ what's that supposed to be
@AstroAthene @Sara_JE_ or is it al mesbar research and studies center
@shawaki_ yeah, I've heard about it, and it's on 2017, not next year
@shawaki_ you've heard about what
@AstroAthene @Sara_JE_ that ras al khaimeh thing?
We have Masdar and CERT, but I hope we get something more related to astronomy and physics and all
I hope that we get a scientific research organization or something here in the UAE at least before 2030
I have already watched the leaked game of thrones episodes, and now I have to wait for about a month for the next episode, dammit
Change is the only thing we can be certain about.
I need caffeine in my system before I start doing something stupid
I see many people tweeting how a mental illness is worse than a physical illness, which is not always true
Nothing is worse than being haunted by your thoughts and having nobody to talk to about it
My emptiness have become complicated
I want to travel on a solar powered airplane. For no reason. I just want to.
@Damnaw I'm the positive-est person here on Twitter am I right
Get over yourself, the person you "like" the most now will probably be just a- or not even a memory after a few years. #notetoself
A day spent alone is a day well spent.
NEIN. @Futaimtaim
I feel like watching the blacklist for the rest of the night or even the rest of the weekend
I always wonder if there's someone out there having the same thoughts I have, going through the same shit I'm going through
I have nothing to do here anymore, but I guess I'll stay, like forever
With this technology and all, we suffer from mental exhaustion, which is just as bad, if not worse
The earlier generations of humans have probably suffered from physical exhaustion as much as we are suffering from mental exhaustion
@essotericx I'm not sure why you're telling me this, but thank you.
@essotericx I'm not sure about it, though.
@AstroAthene I don't want to start a ghanim vs universe battle again
@xentricspirit I had it only for 3 years so
I read anions as onions
@AstroAthene you can say that the universe have left me no choice
@mutedpoem I'm not doing it for no reason
@AstroAthene I don't want to either
@shawaki_ I think that I have to, for some reason
I think that I have to quit Twitter soon. [I'm not kidding (no I'm not saying it for attention)]
I've reached to the point that weekends are not any different than weekdays. I'm not saying that they're bad, though.
If you claim to know other people's intentions you better throw yourself off a cliff
You don't just go and label anyone as a "fake". What I call a "fake person" is someone who takes part on hypocrisy and lies.
No, you don't just label anyone as an "attention seeker". An "attention seeker" is a person who gains attention by harming others.
Speak what's really on your mind, because you'll get hated either way
I like kids who are under 6 years old and very old people who are like at least over 60.
I love kids. I really do. Those polite, innocent kids, I mean.
@Futaimtaim I didn't
@Futaimtaim Spider-Man what
Our school's "literature fair" was shit. The shittiest of the fairs I've been to.
I love it when I wake up at this time of the day

What's true in some people's perspectives is false in others. The fact that we have to die with our uncertainty is disturbing me.
@m5rfa_ potatoes are overrated
Am I the only person on the Internet who likes carrots more than potatoes?
I'm not a "coffee person". I'm not a "tea person". I love coffee, tea, and herbal teas equally.
@AstroAthene no Alyazia that's not how- nevermind
Damn, I love this quote.
"And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music."
Why do we exist? How can we be certain about it?
I'm an ignorant when it comes to that
I want to study quantum mechanics. I like quantum mechanics, and that's because I can't understand it. I can't make sense of it.
I like you. I don't want you to know me any better.
"Disney is for kids." - kids
I don't really like "open-books"; I like mysterious people, those who seem to hide a part of their character.
You might end up looking like a homeless drunkard, but at least you'll look like a confident homeless drunkard
If you want to be confident about how you look, try to avoid looking at the mirror as much as you can
which shows that I'm pretty twisted
@mutedpoem why won't they block me lol
Raymond Reddington and Dexter Morgan are my favorite fictional characters
I once met someone who blocked me on Twitter, and it weren't awkward, I'm not even kidding
Reading about the plants and animals that recently got extinct or endangered depresses me
Why do particles have mass
I like math, I really do. But I hate graphing.
The Blacklist is the most underrated show I've watched. I only watched 4 episodes, and I already think that it's better than Breaking Bad.
@shawaki_ thank you shaikha
@floralsalama I did, for 72 hours, I am a hero
@AstroAthene yes, I am. Real life have became boring.
The only thing I can be totally sure about is how ignorant I am
@fxcthesystem hi
@AishaAlOwais thank you, Aisha
@Sara_JE_ thank you. And yeah I noticed that.
@Damnaw thank you (it was only for 3 days lol)
@Marwantted I stopped for 3 whole days where's my medal
@Marwantted he's weak he have already lost the fight
@mutedpoem thank you thank you
@Damnaw he had a temporary break from Twitter
I would've probably been in a coma if I didn't have 9000 mugs of coffee
I don't fear death, I really don't. But I do fear the death of the people I love.
The universe is flux.
It's sad how fast everything changes and get replaced in our lives.
The most important person in your life today will probably be nothing but a memory after a few years.
@Sara_JE_ my friends and cousins are giants, don't worry I got used to it I guess
@Sara_JE_ I hate it when people say "jk" I feel like they're treating me as if I'm a delicate flower
@A7medMarar I didn't know that it was you, you wore a mask
@A7medMarar I touched you in your shoulder while passing <PEDESTRIAN>
@Sara_JE_ a short guy with a sport cap
@Sara_JE_ anyway, you didn't spot me, right
@Sara_JE_ no it's not
@Sara_JE_ alyazia did, I thought
The fact that I've been spotted in comicon and I didn't spot anyone is disturbing me
@asmatine if you're interested in serial killers, watch the tv show Dexter, you'll really like it
@asmatine yeah, but there are enough of them in the world already, though
I want to have a conversation with a psychopathic serial killer, at least once, before I die
I regret not getting it
I saw a mini Deathwing action figure, which was the best thing I've ever seen there
@AstroAthene wallah ma3arf shu agool you're quite a detective <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@AstroAthene you could've just said "hi" of something
@wahabsensei also the shadow
@AstroAthene I don't remember that I did, but well, I'm impressed
@wahabsensei yep
@Damnaw you're a genius amna
Comic con was creepy, it was full of people with masks and all, and worse, people without masks
Look at the shadow. Duh. 
@AstroAthene I wonder how you knew that it was me
I tried to look for a "satan" action figure or something and I was very disappointed
@AstroAthene the awkward eye contact girl was you
@AstroAthene btw I have probably spotted you too, right?
@Rapuuuuuuunzel I didn't stay in any booth, I was just wandering around
@Damnaw btw, were you there
@AstroAthene dammit, how did you
@Damnaw nobody did, I was hiding in the shadows
@Damnaw I'm back home
I didn't have tickets but I entered as an employee lmao
Sigh. Dammit.
I'm already getting death threats, from now, I think that I have to go
I'm going to comic con just because I don't want to get murdered by my classmates tomorrow
@rihabthegreat not just that, having something to keep you busy is way better than having nothing to do
@AstroAthene well, you're welcome
Am I the only who's not at all bothered by the fact that today is the last day of the vacation?
I can't even decide if I'm the most indecisive person on earth or not
@shawaki_ my classmates got me the tickets but I think that it's not worth it
I still can't decide whether I want to go to comicon or not
@AstroAthene pffft you'll be shy one, just try to find someone as tall as napoleon bonaparte
@Sara_JE_ of course it's easier, but you have to say nothing, show nothing, and be nothing
@AstroAthene I do have the tickets but I don't think that I'll go (no not because of that <UNAMUSED FACE>)
@Sara_JE_ I've met many people from Twitter in real life without even knowing how they look like
@AstroAthene I'll probably be there but try not to spot me
@Sara_JE_ many people from Twitter are going to be there, which is not a good thing (I'll try to go, bchoof)
@Sara_JE_ you'll be there, right?
@Sara_JE_ my classmates bought me a ticket and they're going as a group, so that's not the issue here
@Sara_JE_ I'd rather stay home trying to figure out how to unite the Germanic people under one flag
I have tickets for comic con and I can go tomorrow but idk man
"Soon you will have forgotten the world, and soon the world will have forgotten you."
-; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away."
"Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current-
The worst feeling ever is when you are haunted by your thoughts while having nobody to talk to, I guess
@Owmaa_  to a wrong address, probably
I stopped expecting happiness in my life when I was like 7
If sex segregation weren't embedded in our society, the world would've been a better place, in my opinion
I feel like spending tomorrow's night doing nothing but staring at the stars, alone.
@xentricspirit it's funny because it's very accurate
this, though
I was able to get a ticket for comic con so that I go tomorrow but I passed it to someone else
@rihabthegreat the opposite of oval, you can say
@rihabthegreat it's because planets are shaped as "oblate spheroids"
Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, but Mount Chimborazo is farther from the Earth's core than Mount Everest
Aristotle assumed that the Earth was round by studying the shadow it casts on the moon during a lunar eclipse
@floralsalama that's what made it funny
@rihabthegreat I know right, lmao
@Fatimagulun my maid believes that we were once bananas
Come on. It was funny.
They eat 7,700,000 bananas every year, and they only eat 6 monkeys
Human beings eat more bananas than monkeys
fun fact: if there was only a single particle in the universe, there will be no such thing as temperature
@Sara_JE_ @youthsin no, he's coming back, but "I'm too lazy to type my long password"
@youthsin I feel like sending him a screen shot of this tweet
@rihabthegreat you're welcome, I was going to continue and tweet about how "real" OUR existence is but nah
@xentricspirit -smokes weed and imagine himself as a unicorn flying over a rainbow-
if there were no conscious beings, at all, anywhere, will anything (non-conscious things) exist
If there were no conscious beings in this universe, will it still exist
If there was another "reality" somehow without any beings that can be conscious of it, how "real" would it be
@rihabthegreat I-I am impressed

@rihabthegreat they don't sell canned cans, I'm disappointed
Well, today is Friday. A perfect day to be depressed.
@Sara_JE_ I actually understand why, I really do <PEDESTRIAN>
@Sara_JE_ I don't want to know what makes you think that
@rihabthegreat yeah, it's as beautiful as the chirping of the birds
@rihabthegreat I know right, she's also adorable and all damn I want to marry her
@Patiimaa she's my favorite animated character, I'm not even kidding
GUYS ISNT SHE WAY TOO BEAUTIFUL
SHES JUST... 
What the mermaid's piss, Jane from Tarzan is way too beautiful, I have a new fictional crush
@AstroAthene I don't know, ask them
@AstroAthene hmph, no. Unless they're wearing shades that's a different story.
@AstroAthene I'm not badass I'm this close to being a mermaid
I need to chat with any human being before I accidentally sell my soul to satan
I feel like unfollowing some of my oldest followers, but I don't want to be an asshole
@youthsin well I write them on a notebook because diaries are too mainstream
I'll probably live alone and die without a witness and I'm not even complaining
It's funny is that you can express yourself without making anyone know what's going on your head. Or that's just me?
*without making anyone know that I'm a psycho
Writing my thoughts on papers and throwing in the trash can so that I can express myself without making anyone think that I'm a psycho
let me find something else to get addicted to so that I can quit Twitter on peace
@Damnaw dem feels, right -wipes his tears-
I felt like crying while eating it, expecting it to taste like an ordinary muffin, but oh well
and that low-fat muffin symbolizes my life
I once ate a low-fat muffin that, judging from its taste, is made out of bread dough, skim milk and sweetener. It was a disappointment.
She's perfect. Hmm she must be hiding something.
I'm spending my life alone. Which is a good thing and a bad thing at the same time.
I thought I've just invented a word while it was actually used by a few others before me.
Semi-anonymous. Take notes.
If I revealed much about myself here, I wouldn't have been taken seriously. That's why I like to stay semi-anonymous on social media.
God, I don't want Wall-E to become real.
People rarely look at the downside of technological advancements
I'm really not looking forward for driverless cars and similar technological advancements. People will get fatter and lazier.
@Fatimagulun depends on the way it's pronounced
I want to become a greek philosopher. The "philosopher" part is easy, but the "Greek" part is hard.
@floralsalama it's actually in ANCIENT Greek, that's why
"Soon you will have forgotten the world, and soon the world will have forgotten you."
Ἐγγὺς μὲν ἡ σὴ περὶ πάντων λήθη, ἐγγὺς δὲ ἡ πάντων περὶ σοῦ λήθη.
@Mrs3freettt too much for racial equality
@Sara_JE_ happy birthday -coughs-
@rihabthegreat if your tweets were coffee, they'll be coffee impresso (because I'm impressed)
@walix85 good luck
@walix85 thank you. By the way, you're majoring in medicine, right?
@walix85 anything but engineering, anything but engineering
@walix85 I don't know what I'm doing with my life to be honest
Before I read a book, I calculate the amount of pages I have to read per day to finish it in a specific date
@walix85 no I want him to have my genes <PEDESTRIAN>
but I want to be a father tbh, raising a child and all. or even better, being a grandfather.
I feel like I'm the only one on Twitter who wants to live his life without being in a relationship or getting married or anything
I like people who see what I did here without having to say "you see what I did here"
I'm officially an emo. dammit.
I feel like making myself a 3rd mug of coffee because today is a sad day I mean everyday is a sad day but today is sadder
@floralsalama it can be understandable, but not justified, though
@floralsalama I didn't imagine myself murdering her because she was bad but because I wanted her to stop talking
@Damnaw it worked
-smiles while imagining himself murdering the doctor-
@Faglal it did, thanks
@TenDirhams yeah it just got back to normal
@Damnaw is this how it works 
I deactivated my account, and I lost all of my followers/following after I reactivated it. How can I restore them? @Support
@Damnaw what should I do now? -sobs-
I woke up and realized that I have a hospital appointment, and then I opened Twitter and realized that I lost all of my followers
@Damnaw what
I must contact the customer support thing as soon as possible
I have a fucking appointment at this time of the day, great.
@Damnaw I don't think so, I'll contact customer support
@Damnaw I have no idea
I have to wake up at 7:00 AM tomorrow because of tomorrow's god damn appointment
(except for those whom I knew from Twitter and then met in real life they do not count <UNAMUSED FACE>)
I wonder why am I still on twitter. Everyone I know in real life, literally everyone, have deactivated on 2012.
God, I feel empty.
Not just on twitter, I mean even in real life.
I'm not associated with anyone. I never associated myself with anyone.
I feel like I'm f3alm thani
I didn't know that such a notorious book could be this good
@Astroaruon it's usually read by rappers, criminals, gangster and all but I actually enjoyed it
@Astroaruon 48 Laws of Power, It's about how emperors, thinkers, scientist etc. rose to power
I can't believe that I finished it in 4 days. One of the most interesting books, I can say.
I feel lost. I've always felt lost, but I mean now I feel even more lost
My little sister and my little cousins were watching videos of Hala AlTurk. I gave them papers and pencils and made them draw instead. <PEDESTRIAN>
God, Twitter have become so boring
Why's it hard for you guys to be kind and friendly to everyone?
Albino ravens are really beautiful.
It's just another lame joke. I really can't understand why women here are always complaining about it and all.
I really can't understand those who take "meninism" seriously.
I'm not much of a reader, though. But those have grasped my attention.
I want to read Dante's The Divine Comedy and Spinoza's Ethics as soon as possible
@rihabthegreat @Sara_JE_ oh, yeah, right. I said that I didn't want to know but ok.
@rihabthegreat @Sara_JE_ I don't want to know why I'm mentioned here
I wonder where will I be in the future. I don't have high expectations, though. All I want is a simple life.
What doesn't kill you fucks you up and makes you become some kind of psychopath
Drinking too much coffee and putting your head on your desk thinking about the purpose of life
Being overweight (NOT OBESE) makes you live longer. This is very good to hear.
@Damnaw even the ceilings got bored from my company, so what about the nurses
@HindAlowais_ it depends on your experience in hospitals, I guess
The amount of people who are incapable of having an intelligent conversation, though.
I hate going to hospitals. Going to a hospital makes me shiver like a mad man, even if it was just for an appointment.
Nothing in life is permanent and nothing in life is certain
Literal-minded folks who do not understand my sarcasm, ironic statements, metaphors and exaggerations are very hard to deal with
@Sara_JE_ you guys aren't suppose to notice. Thanks, I had nothing else to do in life.
Good night, everyone. Tomorrow will be better.


@Marwantted interstellar and inception
BUT LIFE DOESNT HAVE A MEANING
I like people with "complex" minds
Live your life as journey to give it a meaning and make the journey your home.
I can't handle those who speak as if they're yelling, I feel like filling their mouths with bricks
People who speak slowly with a low voice are the best to talk to.
@Astroaruon I started playing in early 2011 and I've quit on 2014. Good days.
@Astroaruon YOU PLAY WORLD OF WARCRAFT
I have just noticed that I am a nihilist
Things I think about: death, death, death, death, the black color of oreo cookies, death, death...
I feel like having a picnic on the beach at midnight with someone I love and talk about death, the meaning of life and all
@SluttyPizzaa  
Welcome back! @fxcthesystem
@mouzoz yeah, I realized that I have nothing else to do in life
@h_assan_ البنت اللبنانية اللي تقول حق الريال الفرق بين "الحب" و "الغرام"
@h_assan_ "غرام" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@h_assan_ 
@AstroAthene well I just put my head on my desk thinking how everything in the universe goes from order into chaos
@h_assan_ but that girl was perfect for the role. She was flawless. She was... -wipes his tears-
@Patiimaa it's great, and I realized that it's actually based on a book. The writer of Les Miserables
@h_assan_ she looks like her walla
@AstroAthene I deactivated for "studying for the finals" once, I ended up thinking about the purpose of life and the black color of Oreos
I deactivated for 2 hours which made  realize how lonely I am
@AstroAthene if you survived for a week why the hell did you reactivate
@Patiimaa I have just watched it <EYES>
@AstroAthene I was this close to dying from loneliness, I downloaded a movie to survive the 2 hours
@AishaAlOwais trust me, it doesn't work
@AstroAthene I survived for 2 hours, give me a medal
I don't know if everyone suddenly decided to get a life or if I'm just a boring person to chat with
@floralsalama my life is not even a movie. It's a drawing. A drawing drawn by a pencil.
@floralsalama I didn't know that
and it'll be a psychological thriller
I'm living such a dull life. If my life was made into a movie, it'll be in black and white.
I'm desperately in need of a human being to communicate with
"Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble up, if thou wilt ever dig." - Marcus Aurelius
I have just noticed that I use the word "though" a lot, which isn't a bad thing, though.
@Patiimaa I haven't watched it, I had it in my to-watch list since forever though
@Patiimaa I don't want to see a live-action of the little mermaid tbh
@Patiimaa Sophie Turner has the hair, but her facial features are very different. I believe that she's a better actress, though
@m5rfa_ they look very similar though

Katy Perry should get the role of Ariel if they were going to remake The Little Mermaid as a live-action movie
A moment of silence and appreciation to the few people on Twitter who understand the importance of having morals.
@AstroAthene yeah but with Twitter, we all are together alone (yeah that was intended)
But they said that there are some risks. You might suffer from loneliness and die alone.
The ancients have said that if you deactivated Twitter, there's a chance that you'll get a life
@AishaAlOwais there's a woman who married a roller coaster
Have you ever started liking someone for being as messed up as you are?
An Indian guy married a cobra. The world doesn't surprise me anymore.

Next week is sponsored by Satan
@rihabthegreat @maaythuh @youthsin have a nice afternoon you all
@maaythuh @rihabthegreat @youthsin why do I feel like you guys are taking it way too seriously lol
@rihabthegreat @youthsin why're you so curious though, it's just a tweet, not a scientific statement or something
@rihabthegreat @youthsin remember when I didn't sleep for 30 hours, I did the impossible I stayed up late and I watched the sunset
I tried to imagine myself being in a relationship. I failed.
@Menaaarrrx everyone is annoying
@rihabthegreat well, I don't know much about it her, but still
I don't like her, but I don't like rumors either. (Don't tell me that you all knew that they were some lame jokes)
Taim AlFalasi didn't actually say any of the things that people claim that she've said.
I need some anti-procrastination pills
@rihabthegreat @youthsin @FreedomIsFunny Mönchengladbach is a nice word too
People are supposed to be valued based on the effort they make, not just by what they succeed in.
I don't know if I want to save the world or if I want to destroy it
@rihabthegreat it's not worth it, it's soar grapes
PRT: one of my favorite quotes.
@walix85 I feel like it's going to be crowded and noisy and all
@m5rfa_ what's cool about it
@walix85 so you're not going
@Sara_JE_ smh, I live my life as if I'm everybody's guardian, I have just noticed that lol
@Damnaw <PEDESTRIAN>
@Sara_JE_ I'm just pissed, it's irritating how everyone find it "cool" and all
I'm the only one who's not going to comic con and not even interested about it
يعيب الناس وهو أكثرهم عيوبا.
Everyone has flaws. But those who are proud of their flaws and try to fancy them are dumb and pathetic.
@floralsalama the word "respect" even sounds like a joke these days
A fucking ignoramus who uses Twitter only to insult and shame others here is respected and all by everyone. That's sick.
@floralsalama they do, but among some very few
The fact that I had to tweet about how the importance of morals and ethics is even making me more sick.
Well, the fact that respectfulness is considered as weakness by some and rudeness is seen as toughness is making me lose faith in humanity
They might deny it by their words, buts it's pretty obvious that that's how they see it.
There's really nothing cool about being rude and all, contrary to what most of the people here think.
This is really pissing me off. People should stop considering rude assholes as tough because they're not. They're just rude.
I stalk myself quite a lot tbh
@shawaki_ plot twist: it's not sarcasm
@AstroAthene good night
It's a beautiful day to have a walk around the neighborhood and kill some random innocents and skin some cats
I'd rather sleep before I say something even more stupid. Good night, everyone.
THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE "TRUTH" AND THE "FALSEHOOD" HAVE STARTED TO BLUR
@marwuh I do get your point, and I agree with it
@marwuh I'm talking about the latter. They're somehow connected, actually.
@Mrs3freettt I'm not talking about "relationships"
@marwuh being unattached to someone is very different than being "isolated" from everyone
@marwuh not really, no. It depends how "isolated" you are.
It feels good to be attached to nothing and no one, but it makes you feel empty as shit.
I'm not exaggerating. It doesn't even bother me, I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
Seriously, I just noticed that I'm way too "antisocial". Months can pass without me having a conversation with anyone in real life.
@SluttyPizzaa I'm not a nerd though I'm a gangster
@SluttyPizzaa are you sure she might think I'm a "nerd" ass guy or something (which I might be)
(It's big compared to yesterday because it's expanding)
How do people do it? "Hi, the universe is big tonight, eh?"
I HATE IT WHEN I REALLY WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE BUT I MUST FIND A WAY TO START IT
I suck at starting conversations, I really do
@badgalmoz @mouzoz SPATULOUS. Nothing else suits you.
@AstroAthene Athena is not tomboyish
@AstroAthene she reminds you of you too am I right
Me: *over thinks not over thinking*
@JayTheAwkward @iotacist there's a guy named John Altman proved it in 1962 (wikipedia)
@JayTheAwkward @iotacist but still there are some scientists who believe on the old theory of adult neurogenesis
@iotacist then what is the process of neurogenesis for?
@iotacist our brain cells are never replaced?
If that was true, where are the memories stored? If in our cells, how can we not lose our memories every 10 years?
@Rapuuuuuuunzel what's weird about it is that it's duck-billed, beaver-tailed and otter-footed
@Rapuuuuuuunzel 
@Rapuuuuuuunzel it's a bat version of the platypus somehow lol
@Rapuuuuuuunzel it was supposed to be black and yellow right
The northern ghost bat. These are the only bat species known to have white fur. 
The Honduran white bat. An amazing creature, isn't it? 
@mouzoz @Romaithiez I am personally offended by the stupidity of that tweet
About 10 years from now, you will have already forgotten every person you've known through the Internet
Parenting is not the only thing the only thing that determines a child's behavior. That doesn't mean that it has no effect, though.
@Owmaa_ google it
“@Powerful_Pics: Food for thought. 

This is partially true.
Sometimes I wish I was a Neanderthal
oreo cookies are black because they contain dutch-processed cocoa, you may all die peacefully now
I should stop tweeting and start writing essays about human's stupidity and oreo cookies
It's annoying that there are a lot of them here on Twitter
those who are way too confident about themselves that that they always point out other people's flaws have reached a new level of stupid
Everything in the universe moves from order into chaos. And my life seems to follow this rule too.
Caribou Coffee is way better than Starbucks in my opinion. Contrary to the opinion that's popular on social media.
@AstroAthene I'm relieved I felt like an asshole for a moment
@AstroAthene I was kidding I instantly deleted it, you're not dull nor uninteresting
@Sara_JE_ @youthsin (I know but I am acting as if I'm confident enough to see it as a compliment)
@Sara_JE_ @youthsin I don't know what you're implying by this but I have a feeling that it's good
@youthsin @Sara_JE_ I'm kidding (yes I am -coughs- -fixes his suit-)
@AstroAthene you're not Twitter either
@youthsin @Sara_JE_ everyone is sending me direct messages about him, I'm jealous
@youthsin that's true it's because he's not here -sobs-
@AstroAthene why are you offended
@youthsin lol no, he was here yesterday
Twitter is dull and uninteresting these days.
"It’s silly to try to escape other peoples’ faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own."
@Damnaw that's what I said
Let's think about the things that human beings don't naturally think about
The world is getting greener although rainforest are being destroyed and all, which is very good to hear
We need @FawFaaw on Twitter.
@alanoodak @Elverojaguar bats are the master race
I overslept and I don't like it

"You can't play on my feelings. I don't have any."
"I love Halloween. The only time of the year when everyone wears a mask. Not just me."
"People fake a lot of human interaction, but I feel like I fake them all, and I fake them very well. That's my burden I guess."
"They make it look so easy, connecting with another human being, it's like no one told them it's the hardest thing in the world."
I can't believe that I know most of you guys since 2012 or 2013.
There must be an update which automatically deletes everything you've tweeted every year
@h_assan_ ma3arf shu agool
@iFabrie I hope we don't laugh at ourselves after 3 years
@SPATULOUS @youthsin she did, I deleted them mwahaha.
@iFabrie wait I'm on derp mode we were doing them right my bad -walks slowly away-
@iFabrie we both said that we made a Twitter account on 2012, and we said that 2014 will be our 3rd year
@iFabrie have you noticed that we were doing the calculations wrong
@iFabrie mashallah
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ let's see what you'll say about your present self after 3 years
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ dude your 2012 tweets though
@youthsin read my 2012 tweets -sobs-
@youthsin how do you do this
@youthsin NEIN. NEIN. NEIN. NEIN. NEIN. NEIN. NEIN.
@youthsin no
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie why do you think that people will attend it
@youthsin I'm not innocent <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm pretty impressed by the fact that I didn't turn out to be a psychopathic serial killer
@iFabrie @SPATULOUS smfh have a nice night 3bdelrahman <UNAMUSED FACE>
@iFabrie @SPATULOUS I'd shake my spear, on your face
@SPATULOUS @iFabrie it was funny
@iFabrie he also has "shakes" -giggles-
@youthsin when your parents think that you sold your soul to satan
ANYONE WANTS TO HAVE A FUCKING CHAT OR ANYTHING IM BORED TO DEATH
@iFabrie dammit <UNAMUSED FACE>
@iFabrie wut is luv
@iFabrie I DONT TRUST YOU AND ILL NEVER DO
@iFabrie I CANT HANDLE WATCHING SOMETHING MORE THAN 5 EPISODES
@iFabrie 176 god damn episodes, no
@youthsin thank you, I'll download Invictus, just because of Morgan Freeman's voice
@iFabrie I already had it in mind since last year but I always procrastinate watching it
guys recommend me something interesting to do in my life (a TV show, documentary, book, anything)
"I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years, my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see."
I feel like a stranger among people
It disgusts me to the level that I feel like tweeting about it every 2 minutes
Many people who do not realize the importance of morals and ethics.
@xentricspirit that's what I thought
@youthsin well don't worry we'll all die soon, enjoy your short temporary visit to this boring place
@youthsin do you want to be locked up in a coffin 6 feet under for eternity
@youthsin you don't want to die, death is boring
Some people here seem to have interesting tweets and all but they get every single tweet from tumblr
I feel like I'm the only person here who doesn't like tattoos and piercings
@shawaki_ alright lol <PEDESTRIAN>
I never thought of that tbh. To you guys, do I seem too emotional or too emotionless?
@MariamAlAwadhi_ -bows-
Giving an advice to someone on public is considered as shaming. An advice is supposed to be given on private.
I hate it when people claim that they're doing good when they criticize and insult someone because of a wrong thing he've said or done
Trying to make everyone feel special to you is like making no one feel special. This is pretty obvious, but still.
A compliment from someone who rarely compliments others is a compliment that really has a value, in my opinion.
If only I was better at expressing what's really on my mind.
@MariamAlAwadhi_ it's either about fitness, or about nudes
@MariamAlAwadhi_ if I didn't start conversations I'd only get mentions once in a blue moon, and they're from bots
@iFabrie enjoy the rest of your day 3bdelrahman
@iFabrie I thought you've retired from stripping when you were 7
@iFabrie no but it'll make you shake like a madman
@iFabrie it's not good for your health, I try to limit myself to 2-3 mugs per day
@iFabrie I used to drink 5 MUGS, get on my level
@wahabsensei 3/4th of the people I know
I believe that human beings are going to be the cause of their own extinction
Rude people in our societies are increasing rapidly. They all must be eliminated before they lay eggs.
It's sad that everyone knows Thomas Edison and those who've heard about Tesla are very few
Thomas Edisons: the filthy businessmen who get the credit for the work of others
Nikola Tesla's: the underappreciated masterminds
There are 2 types of people in the world: Thomas Edisons and Nikola Teslas
@EatTheMoon @Eatmaryum oh well, thank god that it is. I feel stupid for believing it now lol.
@ThisIzMyDesign 
@Damnaw yeah you aren't supposed to know
@Damnaw you make Twitter become so alive amna
@EatTheMoon @Eatmaryum I have just checked IMDb and I've noticed that it's not confirmed yet. I hope that it's a hoax.
Twitter is so dead that it's kind of sad
@AstroAthene let's just make it tonight and get done with it.
@AstroAthene I don't know what to say
@AstroAthene alright, let's make it on the 14th of December of this year
@Mrs3freettt The Imitation Game. It's a great movie based on a real story.
Yes, that's considered as the "appearance" to me.
I mean the way they dress, the way they act, their words choice, even their hairstyle and all.
People's appearance can somehow reflect their personality.
@rihabthegreat one of the biggest mysteries of existence has been solved
@Mrs3freettt @rihabthegreat I'll give you that
@rihabthegreat you might be true but we'll never know
@rihabthegreat @Mrs3freettt yeah I just read that, Dutch-processed cocoa. But even that isn't that black
@Mrs3freettt pure cocoa aren't even close to black, while Oreo cookies are jet black
Really, why are Oreo cookies black?
Thinking about the universe, reality, metaphysical questions, the mysteries of existence and what gives Oreos their black color
they're supposed to be read in morgan freeman's voice, though
I really wonder with whom's voice do people read my tweets
And I find this very irritating
Some people fail on understanding what's actually meant,they instead focus on the words that are used to express whatever is being expressed
I really liked this quote for some reason
@youthsin what's with your antipathy toward guys lol
@Futaimtaim dw I didn't eat any
If I had a talent or something that made me special it'd probably be illegal
@Patiimaa a word used to describe someone or something with pleasing features?

@Damnaw ok then hmph
@Damnaw well control your imagination and start reading them in morgan freemans voice and that's an order
@Damnaw who's tina?
@Damnaw no they're supposed to be read in Morgan Freeman's voice
@asmatine actress* what the heck <PEDESTRIAN>
When I do something really stupid I feel like sending myself hate on ask.fm tbh
@Sara_JE_ sara do you really think that I'm being serious <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Sara_JE_ idk that's what I see in movies
@Sara_JE_ yeah but dying alone is just sad
@Sara_JE_ if you didn't, hold on to your hope that you'll find people you can relate to when you retire
@Sara_JE_ well then hope that you find people you can relate to when you get employed
Blaming your children for the fact that you didn't raise them properly is just genius
If I don't find people I can relate to and all when I go to university I will be pretty sure that I'm hopeless
So guys how do you feel when you know that the first episode of game of throne's 5th season will air after a week?
@asmatine I find her expressionless face annoying tbh, she's not a good actor
Nothing is better than a cup of coffee early in the morning
Pffft all disney movies are better animated in my opinion
@alanoodak they could've got Ming-na Wen, the voice actor, to play the role. She's 51, but she still looks young
A white girl with big boobs will have the role of a Chinese female warrior that's just idk man
Who remembers the days when fir9ad and nabj were so common that we had them every year
MY SOUL IS ITCHING
I feel like shooting a bullet on my head to end those headaches
I woke up at 7:00 and I stayed on my bed for an hour ok great
Fuck today. Fuck everything that happened today. And good fucking night.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY @youthsin
@AstroAthene <DANCER><DANCER><DANCER>
@Futaimtaim bye <PEDESTRIAN>
@Futaimtaim oh <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ hi
@Futaimtaim long time what
@Futaimtaim yes because why not
I would look like a 12 year old if I shaved my facial hair I'm not even kidding
I can, because I think I can
@AstroAthene same here, that's because everyone is like this and we have no other choice. (A7s eni wayed t7mst )
@AstroAthene even in meetings, gatherings, or anything. It's getting way too far, and nobody's giving a shit about it
@AstroAthene yeah, but it's the same with the teenagers we see in cafes and restaurants, they never stop staring at their phones
@AstroAthene what's sad about it is that every single kid I know is ADDICTED to the iPad, even the 2 year olds.
@AstroAthene it's not only about the kids, it's even about us teenagers. Being addicted to video games and all have become what's "normal".
@AstroAthene I wish it was that easy, it's not only about siblings it's about everyone
And how most of the teenagers and adults are spending their lives on their smartphones and video games
I really don't like how most of the kids these days are spending their lives staring at iPads
I'll keep telling myself that until it becomes true
-tries to be optimistic for once- school days might be stressful, but they're way more fun than the vacation in my opinion
It's ironic that most, if not all, of the interesting people I follow on Twitter have less than 1000 follows
Do not confuse an interesting Twitter account with a popular one
I'll probably change my mind though
I feel like I'm the only one here who doesn't want to ever be involved in romantic relationships
the positive thought of the day. have a nice day everyone!
friendly reminder: our time is numbered and we all are going to die soon
WE'RE STRANGERS WHO CAME FROM NOWHERE TO A STRANGE LAND AND WE'RE LEAVING IT VERY SOON
The fact that other people don't naturally think about it this way makes me uncomfortable
The fact that we're like visitors to this world who came from nowhere, and that we're leaving it very soon makes me feel like a stranger
@AstroAthene it'll be dead for the next 2 or 3 hours only, don't worry
I imagine people who post pictures of only half of their face as Harvey Dent
Twitter will be dead for the next 2 hours I guarantee it
Many people would've been way more confident, which would've made them attractive, if mirrors weren't discovered
Curiosity didn't kill the cat. It's stupidity did.
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ you're not tweeting through the web right
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie no I'm reading a book about how merciless, ruthless people rose to power
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie I didn't think about it tbh
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie about the dull and all part, yeah <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie I think I need some music too my life is getting dull and all
It's funny that when we read history, the good side always "win". It's because they're the ones who'll get to write their history.
Let's just hope that Wall-E doesn't become real <PEDESTRIAN>
- J.R.R. Tolkien
I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO PUT IT IN WORDS ASDFGHJJK
There must be a "change". A way to "control" the advancement of technology in a way that keeps us at peace with our nature.
It's annoying that most people fail to realize this
What's considered "normal" these days is not natural
I wish I was born on the 1200s tbh
I really wish I was born in the days where people had books instead of the Internet, meetings instead of social media
I see the fact that machines are doing most of the work these days instead of human beings as a bad thing
“Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure.”
—Tacitus, C. (A.D. 55-120)
People who have "genius", "realist", or "not your typical-" in their Twitter bios are funny
@Damnaw @LamyaVEVO I had to say it I weren't able to hold myself
@Damnaw @LamyaVEVO you goat to be kidding lamya
-acts like he knows what he's doing-
When I want to draw something, I imagine myself drawing something like Monalisa and I end up drawing a stick figure
Thinking about it disturbs me
If I ever get married I'll have another bedroom, another toilet and I won't even think about sharing my bed tbh
I like people who are awake before 10:00 AM
@Damnaw ma3arf shu agool
The fact that there are Arab Emiratis who ridicule 3eemis, baluchis and people from other ethnic groups is even more annoying
The fact there are Emiratis who degrade and make fun of foreigners is very annoying

Why do I feel like every bone in my body is broken and every muscles is torn every time I wake up
I need to have someone I actually like in my life as soon as possible
I'm the bittersweet-est person I've ever known
I noticed that I always talk and think about "human beings" as if I'm not from them. I like it.
@AstroAthene n-no I don't
@AstroAthene mn 7lati ana <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@AstroAthene alright, send me some as an evidence (you wanted me to say it)
@AstroAthene how do you want me to reply? <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Even if you stare at Marilyn Monroe's pictures long enough she'll become ugly too
You can make any selfie become ugly by staring at it long enough
I have to sleep before I say or do something stupid that I'll regret after coming back to my senses
and that's how she looked in the movie lol 
I feel like an asshole when I unfollow people I've accidentally followed when they have already followed back
This is a real picture of Joan Clarke. The girl who's played by Keira Knightly in The Imitation Game. 
#NowWatching The Imitation Game
I'm bored to the level that I'm actually thinking about starting a "DM game".
Before I die, I want to open an observatory where I can spend my time alone doing nothing but observing the sky
I had this as an avatar for about a year and no I'm not thinking about changing it
THANK YOU JOHN LOCKE.
Serial killers and psychopaths wear masks for a reason
It's like give me a mask and I'll say whatever I want to say and I will really "speak my mind"
It's funny and ironic that when people start knowing me better, it becomes harder for me to actually "be myself" around them
Desiderata aka "desired things"

@MariamAlAwadhi_ I can't wait for the Internet-quakes it will cause
@iFabrie they made some people wait for 11 years, we expect a masterpiece. + Chris Metzen is working on it so this gives us hope
@LamyaVEVO live action. It'll be a bit like game of thrones, but in Avatar style. That's what the director said.
@MariamAlAwadhi_ I can't wait tbh <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@iFabrie let's hope that it becomes successful like the lord of the rings or Harry Potter
@LamyaVEVO lets hope that they make a series of movies like Harry Potter or lord of the rings (and they'll probably do)
@MariamAlAwadhi_ haih, and they'll know nothing about the lore except from the movies w bytfalsfoon ba3ad. Mark my words.
@iFabrie the trailer will probably be on September or something, let's hope that they make it earlier
@MariamAlAwadhi_ you'll see that after the first movie, everyone will act as if they're warcraft fans and all
@LamyaVEVO yeah, 11th of March 2016.
@iFabrie who told you about it <UNAMUSED FACE>
It'll shake the internet on early 2016. Mark my words.
The Warcraft movie people are waiting for since 2006 will be on the big screen after less than a year and nobody here is excited about it
@maaythuh <DANCER><DANCER><DANCER>
@MariamAlAwadhi_ I like to tell myself that too
@MariamAlAwadhi_ math is fun, but graphing sucks. Even drawing lines on coordinate planes suck.
@Marwantted yeah, I do love the poetry and all, but not the e3rab and the na7o
@Marwantted arabic is wonderful, but e3rab isn't. Schools teach arabic in a way that makes us hate it.
@nin8D I swallow my words
@Sara_JE_ I like math, but not that. I never liked graphing. I hate graphing anything.
or worse, graphing polynomial functions
I'm so bored at the moment that I don't mind studying e3rab for the rest of the night
I feel like a have to send a selfie to break the cycle of compliments @maaythuh
@intersomnious even if they were like that in real life, that doesn't justify their doings
@AstroAthene god dammit alyazia just let me be confident about my height
@AstroAthene he's ACTUALLY only 3 centimeters taller than me <UNAMUSED FACE>
@AstroAthene really it makes me feel like Napoleon Bonaparte I'm not kidding
@rihabthegreat @Sara_JE_ thank you rihab
@AstroAthene -grabs a bag of confidence- I don't want to I actually like myself that way
@Astroaruon both of my grandfathers were about my height so I guess I have no hope
@AstroAthene @youthsin I look like a dwarf in the lord of the rings movie hanging out with some human beings
@Sara_JE_ you work for satan
@AstroAthene @youthsin my friends are about my age and they are 170-185, I'm not even kidding
@Astroaruon been at the same height for about 4 years
@youthsin I'm not THAT short
@HindAlowais_ thanks I try
@HindAlowais_ I don't wight, I rong
@AstroAthene keep it it's cool
@AstroAthene don't worry yours is cool too (you can change it again though)
@AstroAthene Minerva is the roman version actually. Damn, @Astrominerva would've been cool.
@AstroAthene it's Athena actually, Athene is a pseudonym given to a guy named Bachir Boumaaza
99.5% of the questions I get on ask.fm are about my age. 0.5% are about why don't I post pictures of myself here.
Throw a javelin at your curiosity's heart
Ask me a question | 
Loud people should be kept isolated in a prison island or something
I'm pretty twisted
and then watch a disney classic and call it a romantic night
and then have a conversation about how our lives are nothing but a moment and how everyone will die soon and stuff
I want to sit with someone I love and just play chess, drink coffee and have a conversation about reality, death and all
@floralsalama philosophy (meditations),  realistic fiction (the catcher in the rye) and psychology (man's search for meaning)
@floralsalama Meditations, The Catcher in The Rye, and Man's Search for Meaning
@MayedMAbdullah I can't deny that what you said was very wrong, but they're shaming you about it, which is equally wrong if not worse
@yvesaralaurent what will get better, the Twitter fights or the real fighting?
@yvesaralaurent what did we expect we are in the Middle East <PEDESTRIAN>
Twitter is full of "moharabat" and "moqatalat" at the moment and I don't like it
@M7mdbinkalban @shawaki_ what he said isn't good, but shaming him isn't good either, in my opinion
I don't understand if those people have no common sense or if they do not care about what's right and what's wrong
Insulting them and ruining their reputation and confidence makes you even worse than them.
I mean if they were doing something wrong, you are supposed to talk to them and get them out of it. That's the right thing to do.
I hope those who ruin other people's reputations and try to damage their confidence get fucked by a cactus
I hope being kind, having morals, and being respectful becomes a thing
@rihabthegreat he has 5, one is on the trigger and the other is above it. We can see that his joint isn't moving. (I'm good at parties)
Ask me a question | 
@alanoodak the awesome-est creature ever am I right

Imagine having a walk around the neighborhood with a bat on a leash having it fly and all
Why can't we do the same thing with bats? They have a similar social system too
Wolves have domesticated as dogs because they had a complex social system and we've taught them that we're the "leaders of the pack".
@youthsin n-no they're not
@floralsalama they're even better on Friday nights
People posting pictures of kittens and puppies and all, just look at how adorable the baby bats are
Newborn bats 
@alanoodak I was just trying to the avoid the question <PEDESTRIAN>
All of you slept late yesterday because it was Thursday and now all of you are waking up late aka I'll be alone here
@Damnaw pffft I'll never get caught
These are the things that make me want to see the world burn
Great, I can't sleep now. I hope it doesn't end up like that 30 hours no sleep day.
I need to move to another house. A house where people are asleep at this time.
@iFabrie I'm supposed to be asleep now right
@iFabrie you didn't hear her voice :(
@iFabrie it's the cinderella effect on my brain
@iFabrie we're both innocent, cute and "white girls", right
@iFabrie 5alek saket 3yal
I really am I'm not kidding
I'm in love with cinderella
She's like the most beautiful person I've ever seen (I had to say it) 
When kindness is seen as weakness and rudeness is seen as bravery, this is when I lose faith in humanity
I find thinner lips way more attractive than the thicker ones
plot twist: not every guy who doesn't put his picture as an avatar is ugly or shy it might be for some other reasons
@shawaki_ I never smiled for photos because I wanted to seem like a serious kid <PEDESTRIAN>
It's annoying how careless and ignorant most of the people I know are. They really do not care about giving their lives some "meaning".
If I ever have kids, I would not raised them the way I was raised.
I wonder how would the lives of the people of the coming generations will be. I don't really think that I would like to know, though.
Civilizations and technology are advancing, while the life of humans, as individuals, gets worse as time passes.
If I really understood myself, what I want, where I want to be, and what do I want to be doing, that's enough to me really.
I won't live my life hoping that I'll meet someone out there who will understand me.I'll live it hoping that I'll understand myself one day.
@marwuh yeah I just meant that you're a brilliant artist, keep it up
@marwuh and you called my "piece of art" cute. I can finally sense the sarcasm now.
@Sara_JE_ have a nice night Sara
@Sara_JE_ I've never took a half face selfie ok -grabs his toffee nut latte-
@Sara_JE_ plot twist: Harvey Dent
@Sara_JE_ wait I'm a white girl
@Sara_JE_ do you really think that I take half face selfies <UNAMUSED FACE>
@youthsin yeah, I loved the words too.
"And God said, Love your enemy, &amp; I obeyed Him &amp; loved myself." - Kahlil Gibran
because you know cleaning your room from glitter is a very hard work
If you treat someone worse after knowing their age, appearance or ethnicity, I hope you get glitter all over your bedroom
“@Powerful_Pics: Time. 

Time does exist, and we do need "time" to organize events.
@youthsin no one is ugly
I see this both as a good thing and a bad thing tbh
Imagine yourself opening your closet after 20 years and associating the books with the memory of the people who told you about them
If you think about it, when you give someone a book, or tell them about one, they'll probably remember you forever
Most people never lose their books, no matter how old the books are
I can't believe that I missed the movie lol I went there for nothing
I wear a cap when I go to malls because I don't know how to wrap a 39amah tbh
Hi — Hello 
@Lujaain94 thank you.
I don't like to live in hope that there will be someone "out there" who'll understand me.
I wonder how the social lives of the people of the coming generations will be. I hope it gets better than ours.
Social media made us connect with each other in a way higher degree, while the people, as individuals, are feeling more "alone".
I feel like as our civilizations advance in technology, the civilizations as a whole advances, but the life of the individuals gets worse
I'm not interested in cars and those movies of muscular ass guys with guns, but I'm going to watch fast and furious 7 today I guess
@emilypond12 @youthsin god dammit Alyazia <UNAMUSED FACE>
@emilypond12 @youthsin I used that account for a week or two, my other account was "agentman" or something <PEDESTRIAN>
@emilypond12 @youthsin oh well, of course it is
@youthsin I always saw you being retweeted to my timeline I never knew that it was you
@youthsin wait you're the 7daysoftorture girl
@emilypond12 kiddy108 and zwinky12345, whats wrong with us <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@emilypond12 god dammit alyazia
@emilypond12 at least I'm a man enough to try -walks away slowly-
@emilypond12 b-but how did you see it
You're don't seem friendly — Why 
You inspire me — That's cool 
Kill your curiosity
The fact that tomorrow is Friday is disturbing me
a part of me dies every time I tweet something with a typo especially if it gets retweeted
If you make fun of people with disabilities I'll make fun of you in your funeral
@youthsin I can smell the sarcasm all the way from sharjah
Ask me a question | 
@Astroaruon yeah, I hope that I improve later though
@Astroaruon I'm not into art actually, never been good at it
@Astroaruon yeah I have seen your other works you're brilliant -walks away slowly-
@Astroaruon thank you for drawing something nearly as bad as mine to motivate me
@youthsin are you sure
I didn't know that anyone will notice it lmao I've embarrassed myself
@marwuh yeah <BROKEN HEART>
@SPATULOUS yeah she's a sketch
@Astroaruon it's my first time drawing don't laugh at me ok
@youthsin am I a Twitter artist yet
There are quite some people who appreciate art, literature and science, but those who appreciate philosophy are very few
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie don't we all sara, don't we all
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ have a nice day 3bdelrahman
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie I'll never post them here tbh I'd rather post nudes
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie birds, owls, bats, landscapes, human beings in a 4th grader's style
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie I'm still bad at it though I can't draw a straight line
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ this guy knows
I hate to have arguments or debates. People never change their opinions after wasting their energy on them.
I like to draw a lot although I suck at it. I like to read and learn although I'm pretty illiterate.
I PHILOSOPHIZE A LOT AND I LIKE IT
No one irritates me as those who do wrong and fancy their doings.
What if I told you guys that everyone's opinion on himself is the only thing that defines him
it's funny how some people act as if they know you better than how you know yourself by making false claims and baseless assumptions
How old ar- — -sobs- 
Ask me a question | 
I don't know if I'll be happy or sad if earth got invaded by aliens
@iFabrie no one
I'm not sure where did I get it from, but I found it in my gallery
Life and death. 
Although I know nothing about art and all, I really admire those who post their artworks here

I don't want Mulan to be remade as a live-action movie. I believe that Disney movies are better animated.
I am actually curious about how does being drunk feels like. Don't tell me that I'm the only one.
what is this
I just took a picture of the sky from my window and 
My people-to-force-choke list is getting longer everyday
@Damnaw <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@Damnaw this is so cool amna
Sometimes I "swim" so deep in my imagination that I forget how reality is like
@Damnaw amna
and then he sees me as short white guy putting his hands in his pockets
When I meet someone from Twitter, I feel like he imagines me as a tall muscular guy with a Viking's beard
@rihabthegreat yeah, and white clothes can show signs of dirt
I feel like I'm the only person on Twitter who actually likes to wear white instead of black
@iFabrie yeah I copied it from your mind
guys this is not any sandstorm, this is a darude-sandstorm
I like animations movies more than the live action movies
and I like the good old 2D animations way more than the 3D ones
From what I've been getting, I actually deleted Whatsapp. I'm not kidding.
@intersomnious every tweet in my timeline for the past 5 hours was about it don't worry
@youthsin @LamyaVEVO don't worry this universe doesn't need humans actually
@LamyaVEVO more scary 
@rihabthegreat you're welcome
@rihabthegreat happy burfday
My hatred for weekends even survives the vacations
Ask me a question | 
isn't it cool that the light going through our windows is very "yellow"?
Would you rather live in the mountains or on the beach? — The mountains 
I like it when I don't wake up that late
@shawaki_ I just needed some sleep I guess
I'm back to the older version, and I didn't do anything. I believe in miracles now.
I can't believe it but Twitter miraculously "downdated" itself 
@Damnaw you're back to your old avatar, I like it
Sometimes I feel like I want to see the world burn, I'm not even kidding
I'm sick of everything, literally everything. I'm sick of life, in general.
@Damnaw I would've done it but I'm way too sleepy to start a fire
I am trying to sleep and my siblings are watching tv with a very high volume, I feel like burning the house down
And now I fall back to my demons and contently I shall sleep
not bored, I'm just getting sleepy -yawns-
@SluttyPizzaa yeah, and when I get more questions I reanalyze my life
I'm actually getting bored from the questions I'm getting lol
@shawaki_ -bows-
@Sara_JE_ yeah because real men do not have feelings and they do not fall in love
@shawaki_ I was just trying to avoid the question <PEDESTRIAN>
@Sara_JE_ I'm just trying to avoid it you know
In love — I don't fall in love, love falls in me 
I can't even trust myself sometimes
If there's someone I don't want to disappoint it would be my future self
@Damnaw yeah, that.
I hope I don't regret the choices I'm making in the present after a few years
plot twist: no one is actually ugly it's just that some people don't know how to take selfies

@iFabrie I'll buy it asap
@youthsin it's like I had a choice, it updates automatically
@youthsin contact twitter and let them bring back the older version then
@youthsin I won't but I feel like it
@youthsin I know right I feel like quitting because of it
THIS UPDATE SUCKS 
@emilypond12 oh well it seems like I'm asking people to make my night lol
Is there a way I can "downdate" twitter? This update sucks
pretty good — Yeah 
It can take nothing but some words from you to make someone's night
what are you doing now — Relaxing on my bed 
Never underestimate the effect your kind words have on a person
The new twitter update is shit
@youthsin this logic is called no logic
@nin8D oh well
you're not depressed,right!..so you're now smiling.. — Should I be smiling if I weren't depressed? 
People who call others "fake" for trying to improve themselves must have their throats cut; they corrupt our societies
How stupid can people be to use someone's past against them after they've made an effort to improve themselves and changed
what keeps you smiling?! — Who said that I'm smiling lol 
Why does everyone think that I'm depressed
@shawaki_ oh alright, welcome back.
@iFabrie more like a shitty way to be good
@shawaki_ where have you been
why you're still awake?!.. — I never go to bed until I feel sleepy tbh 
thats good...:) — Thanks? 
good..still depressed — I'm not depressed 
what keeps you busy all day?! — documentaries, reading, TV shows, movies, having a walk outside 
why — idk man 
feeling good — not worse than everyday 
how are you — fine, I guess 
give me some cookies
Ask me a question | 
not just that, screenshot a tweet of someone insulting another person and you'll get 100+ retweets too
The fact that cheesy romantic tweets are the ones that are retweeted the most make me lose my faith in humanity
The thoughts I tweet here are like nothing but a drop of water in the Pacific Ocean
Every idea which is now followed by everyone started as a strange idea.
Just because you have an idea that sounds strange or peculiar in our society, that doesn't make it wrong.
Just because the majority follows it, that doesn't make it right.
It's written by the only Roman Emperor who was also a philosopher.
Marcus Aurelius' Meditations is a great book, really.

I fear what we are incapable of knowing. The things we can never be certain about.
being too good or too merciful can be the foolish thing to do with some people
I will be disappointed by the human race if scientists didn't bring mammoths back before I die
sometimes I feel like I want us to achieve world peace and all and some other times I wish that earth gets swallowed by a black hole
@floralsalama hatred of humans in general
@floralsalama misanthropy have always existed and will always do

Thank you very much
it seems like there are people who are afraid to "think" about some things because they're afraid from what they'll get from it
people who think that they're winning an argument because of their use of insults and sarcasm are just dumb
if you make fun of someone for a health issue he's suffering from I'll make fun of you while you bleed to death
@Sara_JE_ yeah I meant to use it against him
@Sara_JE_ no, Edison <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Sara_JE_ "everybody steals in commerce and industry. I've stolen a lot myself. But I know how to steal." guess who
@Sara_JE_ yeah, but we can't deny the fact that he was actually smart
@Sara_JE_ he was smart
bats are cute and your arguments are invalid
@Sara_JE_ we're talking about him as if he's some elementary school bully or something
@iFabrie انت كيوت
@Sara_JE_ I feel like he's such a smart annoying prick
@iFabrie انك فتاة بيضاء
والله احس اني قو يوم اكتب بالعربي <PEDESTRIAN>
@rihabthegreat yeah that's what I'm doing
@iFabrie fuck you 3bdelrahman <UNAMUSED FACE>
@rihabthegreat I'm not much of a writer
@iFabrie الريال مات وهو فقير مع انه كان من اعظم العباقرة في العصر الحديث
thomas edison was more of a businessman actually
it's annoying that thomas edison's name is associated with the inventions while nikola tesla is the real mastermind
somebody somewhere must write a book or something about nikola tesla
MARCUS AURELIUS.
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SHAME SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT OTHERS
forgive, forget, tolerate. People here should stop being judgmental pricks who lose their minds over the silliest things.
if you expect flawless or perfection from others, it is guaranteed that you'll be disappointed, some people do not seem to understand this
I don't like it when people who get easily interested on others and then get easily disappointed
@youthsin alrighty then I'll never call you by your name
@emilypond12 oh my god alyazia you're hilarious.
@youthsin no judy seems to be a name of a nurse or a manager's assistant
@youthsin every straight male in this planet is going to hell thank you njoud
@usuaIly I'll probably cry myself everyday saying "I wish I didn't tell her that she's cute"
@emilypond12 I have just googled it<PEDESTRIAN>
@usuaIly tell me about it <PEDESTRIAN>
@emilypond12 oh yeah this one is wonderful but I didn't remember it's name so
@usuaIly no I won't risk it
@_3layaaa_ @iFabrie people who are insane are not sane enough to realize that they're insane
even if she knew that I weren't sarcastic she'll still block me so idk man
If I told her that she's cute she'll probably think that I'm sarcastic and she'll block me
@_3layaaa_ @iFabrie they're only evil from about 10-19, then they turn back into angels
@SerMonkey season 1-4 was better than those 2 shows in my opinion (although I've only watched the first episode of true detective)
@SerMonkey have you watched Dexter?
@emilypond12 it's the only one that I know by name so <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@iFabrie the white girl in me strikes again <PEDESTRIAN>
@iFabrie dude kids are cute and innocent and all why would anyone not want kids?
Tattoos and piercings are disgusting. Anything unnatural that's done to the body for the sake of so-called beauty disgusts me.
the more you to talk to a guy the closer you guys get. the more you talk to a girl the more annoying she sees you.
@emilypond12 the mainstream horse-head nebula
this night is a very depressing night somehow
my thoughts are consuming me and I don't like it
I don't know where I'll be 20 years from now and what will I be doing but I'm sure that it will not be like how I want it to be
@HindAlowais_ oh well -sobs internally-
Oh well I'm disappointing myself a lot these days and I don't like it
-jumps off the cliff-
I can't believe I liked that person to the point that I feel jealous when someone else talks to her dammit
@HindAlowais_ remember when we met on WoW?
@M7mdbinkalban your beard though <THUMBS UP SIGN>
I feel like having a chat with that anonymous
How sick the rules that are made by our societies are.
reactivating my ask.fm was never a good idea
@emilypond12 pfft yes you are
@emilypond12 and you've got the- let's just stop complimenting each other it feels weird
@emilypond12 alyazia, you're way more creative and thoughtful than me, go write one yourself
My favorite quote. 
plot twist: I actually fucking care
@Sara_JE_ yeah I'm quite desperate
@emilypond12 what if it was followed by neither?  or no I'm taking it too far alright thanks
@iFabrie @iotacist the solution to the Middle East crisis 
@Sara_JE_ actually, it does all three. 1) it doesn't kill you 2) it fucks you up in every way possible 3) the experience makes you stronger
@SPATULOUS oh well
@iFabrie @iotacist the results are flipped. It's a quote from fredrick nietzsche aka your argument is invalid
I still don't know if this emoji "<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>" is happy or sad tbh
@iotacist alright you proved me wrong here have a medal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@iotacist please tell me that you're kidding <UNAMUSED FACE>
@iotacist for example, if you had a close-to-death moment, you won't fear death anymore
@iotacist it might not make us physically stronger, but the experience does make your "heart" stronger somehow
"That which does not kill us makes us stronger."
The future, for example. We can never be certain about where will we be after a few years, which kind of scares me tbh.
Uncertainty depresses me. All things that we can't be certain about, in general.
I fear the unknown. I fear the things that the human mind is not capable of knowing.
There are 2 types of people. Those who like pancakes, and those who lie.
People who lose interest on other people too fast are annoying really. They make them feel appreciated and all, and then they ignore them.
I'm really surprised that I didn't get unfollowed nor blocked by anyone I follow
GHANIM IN THE DARK
asking for ask.fm questions makes me feel like I'm asking for a miracle
guys, I have nothing else to do in life
Ask me a question | 
oh well no one likes boring chats
if you want to have a long boring depressing chat about death and all, send me "hi" as a direct message
DARKLY DREAMING GHANIM
I must refresh my timeline over 9000 times to receive one tweet
IF A METEORITE HIT EARTH AND ALL LIVING THINGS DIE, WILL THIS UNIVERSE STILL EXIST?
Which means that the only difference between a universe that exist and a universe that doesn't is if it had conscious beings?
IF THERE WERE NO CONSCIOUS BEINGS IN A UNIVERSE, WILL IT STILL EXIST?
What if the entire universe is nothing but the result of the consciousness of all of the conscious beings collectively?
@iFabrie change it you had it for way too long that I can't remember your previous avatars
I feel like throwing coconuts at those people who always use "g7ba", "gawad", "5aneeth", etc. to insult each other
When I tell a joke and nobody gets it, I feel more offended than when I get insults.
I'm proud that I still didn't become a psychopathic serial killer
Everything in the universe moves from order to disorder, and I can see that my life is following that rule too
through difficulties to honors.
@m5rfa_ I got sick from my old username I had it for more than a year
@A7medMarar yeah, good luck
@A7medMarar I think it's my first time seeing you in my timeline in 2015
@A7medMarar nothing new, what about you?
@youthsin I got feelings y'know -sobs like a child-
@A7medMarar I've been fighting Santa Claus in a holy mammoth's cave
@A7medMarar dude I didn't see you in my timeline for years welcome back
@iFabrie says*
@iFabrie the 2nd law of thermodynamics days otherwise (I don't understand it well though)
@iFabrie I never expected myself to destroy the world and it still didn't happen
depressed ghanim strikes again<PEDESTRIAN>
it's just depressing
it's sad really when you keep on imagining and hoping that something will happen while you're pretty sure that it won't
@youthsin oh, wow, well, hmph
@youthsin I've never skyped with a girl tbh
@Mrs3freettt 175% of the arab women are brunettes
@Mrs3freettt yeah but still you don't have to feel guilty
@Mrs3freettt don't worry she's not a natural blonde
@SaeedMSSQ shhh nobody here knows
@DamnUseless no it's not
@youthsin no that's actually called metacognition, or "knowing about knowing"
@youthsin b-but I don't do drugs
and I'm not high no I'm not
We can even think about thinking about thinking about thinking about thinking. We can repeat this till infinite.
we can even think about thinking about thinking.
human beings are not the only creatures who can think, but we might be the only beings on earth who can think about thinking.
I want to live in a haunted house with some bat servants who bring me food and all
@youthsin you hate people collectively but you like them individually amirite
I'm an aromatic carrot in a bag of stinky onions
if I ever have kids, I don't want them to end up like me, or anything close to that
Abu Firas Al Hamdani's poems, though
@rihabthegreat I hate people who hide their "last seen" to death
@Damnaw have a nice day amna
I don't do skype calls before 8:30 PM
@Damnaw shhh nobody knows
@Damnaw it's cute that- oh wait I'm supposed to hide it
@Damnaw it's cute that you think that I care about saving people's lives I retired from the superhero work
@coolka_ حسنا
@Damnaw nope amna no
@coolka_ fyi Martin Luther and Martin Luther king jr are 2 different people
@coolka_ yeah I always feel I'm a kiddo or something but I actually sound like Martin Luther king jr or something
I actually love my voice when I record it I'm not even kidding
or worse, I might find myself in a mental asylum
I feel like writing my thoughts down on paper tbh but I'm afraid if someone found them I might get myself executed
@AishaAlOwais a way saner version of Dexter's monologue
@Damnaw goddammit amna
and no I'm not a disney princess
I like the chirping of the birds in the morning, and I like the sound of the ocean waves hitting on the rocks
I don't like any type of sound that isn't by nature
@Patiimaa she's still acting on marvel's agents of shield so keep your hopes high
@Patiimaa let's hope that the voice actor of Mulan is also cast as Mulan in the movie
I feel like all Disney movies are better animated than on live-action tbh. And this is an unpopular opinion.
I classify everything. I even classify people on twitter by the year I got to know them.
I need to get myself a soundproof room
@Damnaw oh my god amna you're hilarious
Fuck. I'm in love. Bye.
NIKOLA TESLA. I WANT YOU ALL TO REMEMBER THIS NAME. FOREVER.
@Damnaw he's a poor guy, walla. One of the greatest inventors who died poor.
The AC standard which is the work of Tesla is still used today, but other scientist took credit for his invention
@emilypond12 oh waw <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Thomas Edison have hired Nikola Tesla for the monumental task of improving his work, but Tesla have redesigned them completely.
Nikola Tesla is the real father of the radio invention.
Guglielmo Marconi made use of a patent Tesla have filed in producing his invention. His works depended on Tesla's research.
@emilypond12 I've never heard of him tbh
This guy is a genius, he deserves way more attention than what he got. 
I feel sorry for nikola tesla
and let's call it a romantic night
Let's just sit and talk about the things that could make human beings go extinct
"The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it."
no one and nothing is permanent
Twitter is dead. This is very depressing.
I feel stupid when people do not get my lame jokes
@Faglal hmph alright
@Faglal that's what the media wants you to think
WHEN I MISS SOMEONE I FEEL LIKE I AM A PUNY ASS DUMB HUMAN BEING.
it's funny that people think that I'm tweeting this as some kind of sick joke, but I'm really feeling like it
@JayTheAwkward oh wow, same here
I feel like murdering some innocents I find on the street and then skinning them. I'll kill them first because I don't want to hurt them.
I try to deny the fact that I love and miss and have feelings and all and I realized that this is mentally destroying me
-smiles at them while imagining the methods he can use to murder them-
I'm going back to my old username to stay anonymous here
@MariamAlAwadhi_ I'm way too pessimistic to see it that way
Expect everything to happen and you'll never be surprised nor disappointed
They say expect nothing and you'll never be disappointed.
What I like about myself is that I've reached to the point where no one and nothing can either surprise me or disappoint me
@Damnaw nope nope nope nope nope
@Mrs3freettt boo is cool because it's the sound that ghosts make
Every 10 minutes, the question "what is life" pops in my head
@Mrs3freettt bae is even worse than babe
@Mrs3freettt both equally irritate me
@SultanAQ__ hmm alright
Anyone? I can't decide tbh
@m5rfa_ are you sure
guys, your opinions please
idk if I should stay with this one or should I change it back
I feel like going back to my old new username (yes, old new)
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie no power*
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie you can't, I already deactivated my three ask.fm accounts so you have power upon me now
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ the annoying part is that I have to read 81 fucking unread mails that's what pissing me off agh
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie ma7bkm. -continues sobbing-
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ I've never been bullied, until now. And that fucking hurts. -sobs-
that's torture
and now I have to read 80 unread messages sigh
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie sigh sigh sigh you two should get married, in the name of satan
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ the language is limited and it is not helping me
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ in Arabic?
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ the English language is not helping me to express my thoughts about this sigh
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ do you really think that this is funny? <UNAMUSED FACE>
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ the phrase I mean
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ you can't do anything now <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ (you're using the meme wrong)
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ pfft I deactivated
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ you won, I deactivated 
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ you have an ask.fm too you know <SLEEPY FACE>
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ fuck you <PENSIVE FACE>
Would you consider yourself a devoted believer? — I don't know 
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ could you just stop pls <DISAPPOINTED FACE> 
your muslim right ? — Um yeah 
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ alright, you won <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie it was funny at first and now it's just annoying <ANGRY FACE>
What do you think of religion? — Idk, man 
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie sara, he really did, he's keeping it up
@iFabrie you had to do this <UNAMUSED FACE>
Thank you @iFabrie 
how old are you? — smfh @ifabrie 
how old are you? — 21 
how old are you? — 14 
how old are you? — 16 
how old are you? — 12

@iFabrie
Ask me a question | 
@iFabrie 10 min wait
@iFabrie alright I'll activate ask.fm
@iFabrie fuck you 3bdelrahman <UNAMUSED FACE>
@iFabrie you never ask a girl about her weight remember
@iFabrie I deactivated all of them
@iFabrie none <PEDESTRIAN>
@iFabrie I have 3 accounts
-activates ask.fm-
"How old are you?"
"How old are you?"
"How old are you?"
"How old are you?"
"How old are you?"
-deactivates-
I understand that it's good for the environment and all but that's just way too far
@iFabrie thou hath been forgiven
I don't understand people who like to read from e-books
@iFabrie fuck you
I remember reading about a minor surgery from the internet a few days before it, it wasn't one of my smartest decisions
The worst part about having a surgery is the fear that comes before it. It's usually way worse than the surgery itself.
@floralsalama it's irritating that I saw people sharing this rumor since 2012
I am something that transcends good and evil
Thanks google 
There's a rumor that's spread that no words rhymes with "orange" and "silver".
@emilypond12 once you into the internet, there's no going back
@emilypond12 oh, I see. I've been here since 2012, I wonder how many more years I'm going to be active.
@emilypond12 you're new here, right?
@m5rfa_ 82k here, fight me
if you want to know how lifeless you are just look at the number of tweets you've tweeted
afternoons are sponsored by satan
one thing can happen one day which can fuck up your whole life,which leaves you imagining what you could've done if that thing didn't happen
Hmph I just hope that this one thing becomes true one day
and we'll call it a romantic night
if was ever in a relationship I want to sit on the couch with her and watch the good old disney classics all day
I'm not high
How could you not be curious about reality, our existence, and the universe itself?
it's like we are born out of nowhere, and our time here is numbered
I don't understand people who do not care about knowing more about "everything".
God bless people with a sense of humor who are intelligent and are capable of having an intelligent conversation.
I feel like they are interesting people
@SPATULOUS no
@SPATULOUS I won't send you a selfie I learned my lesson
she said that she had a crush on me, and then I sent her a selfie
if you have curse words on your bio I'll imagine you as a 12 year old neighborhood gangster
before I die I want to meet a psychopathic serial killer and have a conversation with him about life and all
I know that it's pretty obvious, but it's just nice to note, you know.
It's nice to note how diverse human beings are, every person has his own mindset, thoughts, beliefs, interests and views on things
@youthsin this is my older username
Don't be too stupid, it causes diarrhea
it's pretty ironic that twitter is way more active during schooldays than how it is now
I really can't believe that the God who gave me reason will have me punished for using it.
Depending on your reason and intuition way too much is the right thing to do? or is it a flaw that might lead us to falsehood?
“@9GAGTweets: For all science lovers and lovers of science! - 

Wow.
it's not my favorite book or anything but it's relatable and it can be enjoyed by everyone regardless of their interests and stuff
whether you have always read books or you've never opened a book in your life, you must read it
Everyone must read The Catcher in The Rye
it's sad that it's illegal to drive in the land where women once rode horses and some even fought in battles
The fact that women in some places have to "fight" for their rights is very annoying
Art is not only about paintings. Poetry, music and literature are also considered as art.
there are those who don't know me because of my new username and there are those who knew me now because I went back to my old username
@rihabthegreat my previous username was a bit showy and made me seem pretentious don't you think
@rihabthegreat you'll get used to it stay strong
@rihabthegreat why does it
@emilypond12 it's my 2013 username I didn't have to squeeze my brain cells to make up another username
It's hard to believe that they make up 20% of the mammals on Earth.
Bat wings are magnificent as hell. They look very "demonic" somehow, and it makes them look as if they were fictional creatures.
@SultanAQ__ that's just let's just not change our usernames again
@SultanAQ__  you're the frappaccino guy right
I have a thing for greek and roman philosophies
@SultanAQ__ w ana agool laish mswly 6af
@SultanAQ__ wait, you didn't know that
I'm back to my 2013 username and all, I feel better with this one
@Sara_JE_ yeah. But really, it's better than this one, right?
@Sara_JE_ but didn't you know me like last month or something
@Sara_JE_ @GBinGhaith
this is a very hard decision I need other people's opinions
I feel like changing my username to my good old 2013 username. Should I, or should I not?
@Mrs3freettt I don't know, but I've read somewhere that global warming's effect on the UAE is supposed to be very mild, I'm not sure though
@Rapuuuuuuunzel and by the ancestors I meant the ones like 1000 years ago not the recent ones but whatever it's the same
@Mrs3freettt global warming is very true but I'm not sure if we can say that this is because of global warming
@Rapuuuuuuunzel yeah, and I weren't serious when I tweeted that
@Mrs3freettt I've also heard from that it was a bit cooler in the 20th century, but still
like weren't you guys bedouins why didn't you just travel to a place with a better climate (I'm not high)
Man, how did our ancestors survive it here in the Arabian Peninsula without the AC?
@Owmaa_ who uses the word "spaghetti" in a sad song
@Rapuuuuuuunzel yeah. But isn't it beautiful?
I feel refreshed and relieved
@Rapuuuuuuunzel that's what they call it but it's actually a specie of megabats
It's a majestic animal. It looks like a fictional creature. 
A flying fox, an animal found in Australia. If it scratches you, you'll get meningococcal and you'll probably die. 
@iFabrie you've infected me
@Sara_JE_ lol thank you
@iFabrie like you just skip a whole night of sleep?
the moral of today's story: sleep
today's subject: sleep
@iFabrie but really I wonder what have made me skip last night's sleep tbh, that have never happened to me before
@Sara_JE_ well, everything's great, now. But it weren't earlier.
@iFabrie thank you for the "almost"
@iFabrie I slept. And I'll head back to sleep after a few minutes probably.
@iFabrie I fought bravely, but I've fell into the darkness
Tomorrow will be a better day. Tomorrow will be a better day. Tomorrow will be a better day.
@Marwantted not all of them, you're generalizing
@youthsin I have tried not to but yeah.
Damn, what a day.
@Damnaw I-I am sorry, commander. But I've seem that you've fallen to the darker forces even before me, we had no way to win that fight!
fuck it. I can't stay awake any longer. A "nap" it is then.
It's sad how some people here have no manners nor limits, it's annoying, really.
Nothing irritates me as much when I see a guy who's considered as cool and awesome by everyone for being a rude asshole.
This is not healthy, staying that long without having an hour of sleep
I feel very confused when I see a female having a male as an avatar and vice versa
I'm not a white girl but I really "can't even" anymore
I want to take a nap but I'm afraid of waking up in the year 2072
ignore everything I tweet today, I beg you all
guys I need help, I need to survived 5 more sleepless hours
the duck
what the duck I can't even walk properly
@Marwantted I'm way past this phase, I've reached to the level in which I believe that I'm a cat in space
I don't even know what to tweet when I'm in this situation tbh
I can't wait until 8:30 PM so that I can sleep and then wake up refreshed and "nourished" after the rest
I can't even think straight, I feel cursed with this feverish feeling of exhaustion and dizziness
It's sad that I am way too sleepy and exhausted today to do anything productive
@emilypond12 you're comparing Disney with hala alturk? <UNAMUSED FACE>

I'm actually downloading frozen to know why's everybody so crazy about it
@youthsin caffeine can also be consumed through soft drinks, energy drinks and pills
@youthsin you mean that you do not like coffee?
اني اشعر بالنعاس.
@youthsin thank god that I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine, a cup of coffee can do me good
اريد ان أنام.
@youthsin @emilypond12 too bad that while I'm asleep I can't control it, which can change a short nap to a coma
After 28 hours, I still didn't fall asleep. Get on my level.
28 hours awake until now and I'm exhausted as fuck, but I'm not planning to sleep until 8:30 PM tonight
If you're an overconfident person who's full of himself, there's a very high probability that you're stupid
-complains about attention seekers to get some attention-
I don't know if I should feel bad about myself or proud of myself
I didn't sleep for 27 hours and I'm not even sleepy what does this mean
This was my favorite character on Hercules 
@emilypond12 @youthsin I never knew how to human
@emilypond12 @youthsin believe it or not but I'm not even sleepy anymore
@youthsin @emilypond12 I hate naps, they're like sleep but more with the waking up part and less with the sleep part
@emilypond12 I tried to sleep and I failed. I don't want to sleep now because I don't want to ruin my sleeping "pattern".
If you insult other people's parents, grandparents, relatives, or siblings during an argument, I can't respect you no matter what
as a kid, a part of me died every time I watched the part where mufasa dies in the lion king
I'll spend my day watching Disney classics because I want today to pass smoothly
Sigh
@emilypond12 nope, since I woke up at 10 AM yesterday. 25 hours without sleep, until now.
I won't be tweeting much today because I don't want to embarrass myself
@rihabthegreat no I want to fix my sleeping pattern
@rihabthegreat I didn't sleep since I woke up at 10 AM yesterday, it's a sign of exhaustion from lack of sleep
@AishaAlOwais come on Aisha I've been awake since 10:00 AM yesterday I must keep up the high score, 24 hours without sleep
@Damnaw even C3PO can't translate this
All what I'm thinking about now is sleep, sleep and more sleep
@Damnaw tbh I'm not planning to sleep until tonight so that I can have my sleep pattern fixed
I'm shivering and my heart rate is significantly increasing this is a sign
@Damnaw we are strong powerful people we are independent from slee- zzZzzzZzzzZzzZ
@Damnaw baymax more like baemax -walks slowly away-
@Damnaw I LOVED IT
#NowWatching Hercules (the Disney one)
because everyone is asleep, I'll watch another movie, I guess
@Damnaw thanks commander
@Damnaw yeah my body is very rude (I didn't sleep for nearly a day don't judge)
@Damnaw I stabbed myself to death but I'm still awake and this is not funny
@Damnaw hello, my fellow sleepless person
Don't expect me to tweet masterpieces today, or any day
23 hours awake wow wow wow
I am feeling feverish and I didn't sleep at all last night, do you know how exhausted I am?
#NowWatching Aladdin
Yesterday I slept at 10:00 PM and now it's 6:35 AM and I'm still awake
people are waking up and I still didn't sleep
@HindAlowais_ keep telling yourself that hind
@youthsin stay awake we're all awake but we are silent
@iK5M sleep for the week it I'd then
Yeah sleep is for the weak
@iFabrie yeah and those were two separate phrases
Any volunteers?
I'm awake at this time and I have nothing to do in my life so send me your kik as a direct message and let's have an interesting chat
My sleep pattern is ruined agh, and so is my life
I can't fucking sleep, I just can't
Guys it's my first time to stay awake until this time since eons
@Damnaw yeah <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@Damnaw "life".
@Damnaw it's my first time to be awake at this time in 2012 <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I can't fucking sleep
@youthsin  I know fucking right
I tried to sleep and I kept shaking like mad when I laid on my bed what the hell
@AishaAlOwais good night, aisha
@SluttyPizzaa just like my social life
@nin8D pat your math teacher on her back
it's imaginary
@youthsin oh trust me
My love life 
@youthsin yeah, he's the one who'll change it to a ".", as some kind of a sick joke
@youthsin someone would tweet a fire tweet and after getting many retweets, he'll change it to a "."
@iFabrie @Sara_JE_ dude that's some 7th grade shit
and no I don't advocate racism <UNAMUSED FACE>
Everyone in twitter has black as their favorite color, but white is actually my favorite.
@youthsin @iFabrie stop looking at me as if I'm a freak
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie btw yeah white is when none of the light waves are absorbed that all of them are reflected to your eyes yeah thank you
@Sara_JE_ @iFabrie yeah it is actually
@youthsin @iFabrie did I say anything wrong?
@iFabrie I flied away alright
@iFabrie yeah when an object absorbs all of the light waves that none are reflected to your eyes, you see it black -flies away-
@iFabrie because technically it's not a color
@emilypond12 sweet dreams
@Sara_JE_ meh, no
@Sara_JE_ yeah, I guess. I can't sleep.
ضيق.
I should sleep before I say or do something stupid
@emilypond12 yeah, I guess.
Sometimes choosing to be "good" is not worth it
I feel like a 70 year old man who's sick from everyone and everything and life itself
I feel like staying alone in a calms, tranquil place with nothing but my laptop and documentaries
I hate loud, crowded places which are full of human beings. They make me feel like my head will explode.
