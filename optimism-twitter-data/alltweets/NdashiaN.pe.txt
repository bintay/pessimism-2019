Okay bye. Need to attend to stuff
It's very disrespectful to enter an industry unprepared. Those who've worked hard now have to work extra hard to keep it ALIVE.
I see too many entertainers entertaining everything BUT the people. Too much time spent in bars.
I think if you're an entertainer,you need to take it seriously. That includes the way you speak,wear and carry yourself.
That's why I don't understand singers/rappers who wear garbage bags at important events. Where is your FOCUS?
Entertaining people is something that needs more than popularity. It needs you to be very focused if you wanna STAY RELEVANT.
We need passionate people to do the job #NAMA2015
I think presenting is a nerve-wrecking job. Plus you need PASSION. It's hard
