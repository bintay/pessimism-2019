Thank you for listening.
Except with a much higher accuracy than my *actual* goofball dogs.
(TW: self harm, SI) Like dogs who see trouble coming and bark before my conscious brain has processed a problem.
(TW: self harm, SI) is that my brain weasels start shouting about self harm. So I go - wait, something's wrong?
(TW: self harm, SI) I actually need to trust my brainweasels more sometimes. Bc sometimes the first hint I have that something is wrong is
(TW: self harm, SI) My brain just wants to help. Some brains just do unhelpful things. That doesn't make me broken.
@BatgirlBobbi Hugs. Me too. &lt;3
(TW: self harm, SI) My worth is defined by how I've managed the cards I've been given. And I think I've done all right.
(TW: self harm, SI) My worth is not defined by how anyone else chooses to treat me.
(TW: self harm, SI) My worth is not defined by the fact that my brain likes to deal with certain stressors by shouting unhelpful things.
(TW: self harm, SI) Anyway. I started going down a track too tricky for Twitter right now. But I'm tough. Just needed to say that.
(TW: self harm, SI, suicide) And I understand why. But it means I forget sometimes some of my biggest triumphs.
(TW: self harm, SI, suicide) I don't talk about that, bc people get so scared when you talk about suicide and self harm. They're scary.
(TW: self harm, SI) I can get information out of them and still make choices that I want to make (like not actually harming myself).
(TW: self harm, SI) I'm actually really really proud of how I've learned to not fight with those urges and the shame, but listen to them.
@BatgirlBobbi Yeah, cleaning was a huge huge part of my shame today. Hugs.
@Hellolemur Thank you for your understanding. &lt;3
@track7grrl Yes, the judgment and shame between women, mothers especially, sucks.
(TW: self harm, SI) That I have *always* had. The amount of times I've actually acted on that urge are miniscule. So rare.
(TW: self harm, SI) Frankly, my desires to do my self harm are in fact one of the purest examples of how much self control I have.
(TW: self harm, SI) - let's unpack that and see if I can unravel that shame."
(TW: self harm, SI) I want to be able to talk about "hey, I'm feeling the urge to hurt myself, something must be really pushing my buttons -
@BatgirlBobbi Yup.
@track7grrl Hugs. It sucks.
@Hellolemur I really don't want any advice right now.
(TW: self harm, SI) I don't talk about it much, even here, bc that convo always seems to give the wrong impression.
(TW: self harm, SI) You know what? I still struggle with *really* strong urges to self harm. I have for years and years.
I'm here to be as authentic and honest as I know how to be, in the safest social space I have access to. That's it.
It seems uncomfortable, because it's hard to listen to somebody talk about their shame. Sometimes triggers our own.
Listen. A lot of people have talked about how open I am here, and how much of myself I put here.
I'm tired of being like this. I'm tired of feeling lesser than everyone else, of feeling broken.
The truth is that I was in terrible emotional shape all week, and so I didn't get anything done, so now I'm in a shame spiral about that.
@Hellolemur And when "focusing on myself" just emphasizes my shame-based sense that I'm worthless and alone, that's not very helpful.
@Hellolemur The emphasis is on him right now because he's actually trying to support me. There's nobody else.
@OtherFemme Thank you.
I'm so darn isolated, even now. Arrrrrgh.
I know he's working on it - but it's hard that this week I couldn't turn around and get effective support from anyone else.
I don't know how to survive being so vulnerable with him and never knowing how it's going to go.
Had a really nice convo with husband and then everything fell apart again. I haven't felt this bad in ages.
I love you, pocket friends, for validating that I am not alone in not being a fan of Mother's Day.
@drtantatinycat Hugs for sad and lonely. Also, mom's day is terrible. &lt;3
@rabcyr &lt;3
@rabcyr No, thank you very much for the offer. Just going to bed now. Thanks.
@rippleonthesea Aww. Hard when you're not prepared for it like that.
@rippleonthesea *hugs*
@Nomnomqondiso @rabcyr There are SO many ways that promotion was a bad idea.
Opened up to husband about my parenting frustration, and his responses were all shit. Fuck this.
@Nomnomqondiso @Spotify I'm not super thrilled with "let's just delete it and pretend this never happened," either.
@Nomnomqondiso Looks like they deleted it? Was a "tell us how you'd explain @Spotify to your mom" Mother's Day promotion.
@summerasana I'm ashamed that she's going through this stage of lashing out, and angry, and overwhelmed, and... Ugh.
@summerasana Ugh. I'm so over the hitting. I still can't believe mine hit me last night.
@summerasana I'd gladly take a more balanced societal approach to motherhood and give back the sappy sentiments.
@summerasana *solidarity fist-bump* Most of the time it doesn't faze me, but seriously, hearing "you're so MEAN" over and over gets old.
@summerasana Yes. I didn't mind when they were actual babies, bc they weren't actually cruel, just a lot of work. But 4 yo lately is a jerk.
@summerasana Now I see them! Yes, to all of this. When you're struggling, one day of "honoring" seems insulting.
@summerasana Thank you so much. I'm glad I'm not alone.
.@Spotify So are you assuming that no moms use Twitter, who would see and be offended by this promotion?
Imagining stabbing Mother's Day with a fork is making me feel better right now.
@OhDianeMarie I do it bc I'm allergic to sticking to surface stuff. That's just my damage. And face to face life is all surface. :P
@OhDianeMarie Thanks for listening. &lt;3
@OhDianeMarie Yup. And policed to the nth degree.
@OhDianeMarie Then really I don't know what I'm doing. And I *really* don't know how to interact with society.
@OhDianeMarie (and my husband has been doing good work lately so that I feel less shame coming from that direction...)
@OhDianeMarie If I'm not trying to be a Good Mom and a Good Daughter ...
@OhDianeMarie Of course it is. But I still have trouble figuring out how to let it go.
@OhDianeMarie @thetrudz That is a fabulous point.
@OhDianeMarie But I'm not good at being a Good Mom.
@OhDianeMarie And it's hard not to get sucked in when it's the only job I haven't just utterly failed at. I like being a mom.
@OhDianeMarie All of this patriarchal structure around mothering is crap. Utter crap.
@OhDianeMarie I &lt;3 you. Makes me feel better about hating it.
@sophiaphotos I'm so sorry about your cat.
I can't seem to finish that thought. Maybe bc it feels like it will end with not speaking to my mom anymore. Oh well. Yay, Mother's Day.
But you know what? I'm not 5 anymore. And I've been doing the best I can for my mom, and trying to take care of her, for a long time.
Then I spin that bad feeling around ok myself and think that I'm ungrateful to my mom again.
I get kids are little narcissists, but it still feels exhausting and crappy. And I'm afraid she'll be this way forever no matter what I do.
She made &amp; wrapped a present at preschool, and then unwrapped it even though I was insisting she stop, so she could show off to a friend.
My preschooler has been acting like a jerk lately, including slapping me straight in the face last night.
And you know what? I'm not too thrilled with Mother's Day as a mom, either.
I want to stop faking that everything is cheery and fine and happy when mostly she gets under my skin every single time I talk to her.
When I really just want to be done. I want to stop worrying about it. I want to stop being angry.
I'm mad at myself and ashamed because I feel like I'm expecting too much and I'm ungrateful and I need to think of my mom's feelings.
I am so mad at her for claiming to care about listening and just continuing to be so crap at it.
Last Mother's Day I had a fight with my mom that never really got resolved. I've had issues with my mom all year.
I just want to skip Mother's Day. I just want it to not happen.
I maybe just need to give myself permission to not be around those people. Just wish them the best, and avoid them.
Then I tend to have *serious* issues. I'm still learning to trust my own perceptions, so when words don't match actions, I struggle.
If they don't say as much to me, and in fact are invested in presenting the image that they already have the issue "fixed,"
Which would be fine, and more power to them if they say as much, and then we don't have problems, but
For ex, they talk about how it's important to be nonjudgmental exactly because they struggle a lot with judgment.
I have had to relearn often that some people who say things I agree with are actually in the "fake it till you make it" stage.
I have so far been unsuccessful in replacing the habit of saying "guys," but I am trying, and I think the effort is worthwhile.
I had to give up on Bones a long time ago because death. Watching a random ep is like talking to an ex that you still think is awesome.
Related: I'm having trouble processing that Bones is in its 10th season.
So Hulu means now I can drop in on shows I haven't watched in years and learn things I didn't want to know. Like FB but for TV.
@ami_angelwings They meet species from the Gamma quadrant and the WEIRD thing is that women are in charge!! *eye roll*
@ami_angelwings As much as I love Star Trek, I noticed stuff like this *all the time* when trying to rewatch DS9 lately.
@libraryyeti @brigidkeely This seems like one of those headlines that is supposed to be news but isn't.
@brigidkeely I think you are spending more time deconstructing this than the person spent coming up with it. &lt;3
@rabcyr I really need to read more (maybe when my kids are older?) I think what gets called "socialism" in the US isn't.
@runningnekkid I'm struggling not a the idea that the state is racist, but that it's wasteful, and private action is better.
@runningnekkid Yeah, ok, yes. And the older I get the more I find out that the state has done that I didn't learn in school.
@track7grrl It's what works for me. I hope you'll find things that work for you, too. :)
But how is leaving things up to rich white guy benefactors, who throw money at things in haphazard fashion, really better?
I was raised with skepticism that the state does things well. Dad's a libertarian white guy. So I start from there.
Not that $800k going to schools is a bad thing. I just get so irritated that we stop at the feel good narrative instead of digging deeper.
Am I the only one who reads things like this and it just irritates the crap out of them?
So Colbert, with partners, just funded all of the DonorsChoose projects for South Carolina. 
@track7grrl All the support as you work on taking care of yourself.
Anyway, aforementioned small kids need clothes, supervision, etc. Thanks for listening.
Now that things are going better, the old demons of shame and needing to prove I'm not worthless are bubbling up.
It is perfectly reasonable for things I've put on the shelf, because it didn't feel safe to process them before, to come up now.
Which, yeah, that part is problematic and needs to chill out. It's not good to beat up on myself just bc my husband is laying off.
But I mean? Part of me keeps saying "hey, things are fine now, why are you freaking depressed? Get it in gear! Time to be productive!"
I mean. Sort of ok? Falling apart completely with two little kids around isn't really on the table.
But it still unnerves *me.* I am not doing a good job of saying "hey, it might be natural to fall apart right now, that's ok to do."
And because of the group, my husband now listens to that much better without trying to shut it down, which is awesome.
And also all the pain and fear and anger, now that I have more space to feel them, are coming up and that is overwhelming.
But now it's like I kind of don't know what to do with myself, if I'm not in battle mode all the time?
So that's good, &amp; I'm cautiously hopeful. I don't even feel trapped bc I just tell myself I'm allowed to leave if things get bad again.
@crystalbflat Thank you. Yes, happy and cautiously optimistic describes a lot of my feelings. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
For the first time in a very long time I actually feel like I don't need to keep one foot out the door.
It's not like before, when "too nice" meant "man, you trapped me into staying again, by taking my justification." So that's good.
The group he's going to actually seems like it's working. And his behavior has actually changed.
I've been having a rough week or two and it seems ridiculous. Bc I think what's getting me is the husband is being too nice.
I hate it when Twitter changes. I just want all the things to be where I expect them. Arrrrrrrgh.
@randomjeweler :D
@randomjeweler *clears you a spot over here*
@OhDianeMarie @sassycrass @Ed_Cunard Anyway, if I can help in any way other than by bringing the fart humor, y'all let me know.
@OhDianeMarie @sassycrass @Ed_Cunard Butt + fart cloud = 3&lt;3
@OhDianeMarie @sassycrass @Ed_Cunard Aaaactually, someone pointed out to me &lt;3 looks like a fart cloud and now I can't unsee it.
@sassycrass Of course, I'd bet money my kids are cuter than the people getting on your nerves...
@sassycrass *Literally* they are running naked around my house, tap dancing on things instead of getting in the bath.
@sassycrass You know, I read this tweet, and I thought "wait, have you met my kids? Oh yes, you have!"
@sassycrass @OhDianeMarie &lt;3 you both.
@_GoneAway_ Then a cactus really does seem like the perfect solution. :)
@_GoneAway_ I just couldn't help thinking it would feel symbolic if I gave my mom a cactus.
@_GoneAway_ Aw, that sounds sweet. Hadn't thought about the cat proof aspect.
Y'all, I want to hear from any of you that actually give a cactus to someone for another's Day and have that go well. 
@diannaeanderson That's really, really great. Wish I could go and cheer you on.
@diannaeanderson This sounds like racism/classism/elitism against his lowest skilled workers, hidden behind talk about millennials?
@diannaeanderson What he's saying makes no sense, on follow up. It's a whole generation - except not the ones who've gone to school?
@sawilcox28 I'm not enjoying the sugar crash. Should have had more real food *along with* my ice cream. :)
Eating ice cream for lunch was a bad decision.
@runningnekkid And your point about smaller voices is a great one. It's easy to focus on superstars, but SJ really needs MANY voices.
@runningnekkid Yes. Sometimes I want that next step out of sharing w a dozen or so who will engage respectfully, but don't have bkgrd.
@runningnekkid Yes, exactly.
@runningnekkid Hee hee. Well, if we're having similar ideas that means it's not just me, lol.
@runningnekkid we wanted to, you know? And could always go back/have support if needed.
@runningnekkid I was imagining a space where we could be actually safe and not on guard all the time, and then venture into public when/if
@runningnekkid Like seriously that is a huge chunk of what I wanted to express in my thing! Yes.
@runningnekkid YES. Right.
@runningnekkid Oh yes! I know exactly what you mean. Yes yes.
I should go dig out those Unitarian Universalist books I bought on community. That might scratch this itch for some theory.
@runningnekkid Booo. Darn school.
@runningnekkid Thank you. Also, sorry about the tizzy. *hugs*
@runningnekkid And thinking "how do I freaking manage stuff like this in my dream community?" Bc this is all normal, you know?
@runningnekkid &amp; then realizing a former friend is friends w another friend I didn't realize she knew. Which made me feel like odd one out.
@runningnekkid Nah, watching people act nasty and self righteous to a friend on Twitter aided my brain monsters.
@runningnekkid I would be *thrilled* if I managed to make something that served a smallish group of people well, in a sustainable fashion.
@runningnekkid Instead of just feeling stupid for writing what I sent you and giving up.
@runningnekkid Well, yeah, I know, I know, and I know nothing will ever be perfect, but I really want to try, you know?
I don't even know how to find good theory on building community.
It's something I think about a lot. Community is so important to human beings, how to build it intentionally and well?
I wish I understood more about how to make functional communities.
@nevernotdoing Now I want to see a viral video about car seat installation.
Also, I want Steven's bug sleeping bag for my kids.
Marketing opportunity: now I need a Steven Universe brand duct tape.
@brianwisti I'm curious now to see where Elsa stands in the history of female antiheroes (there've been at least a few...).
@brianwisti Hmm. That does sound like an interesting crossover. :)
@brianwisti @rabcyr Who are you thinking of from the 70s/80s? I'm curious.
Related: I'm going to go watch some Steven Universe and contemplate paying ridiculous money to Amazon video to get more episodes.
@brianwisti @rabcyr It would be easier to see her as an antihero, for me, if she wasn't so reactive. But yes, fair point!
I probably won't see much more Marvel movies. I'm pretty over it. But I would see Black Widow or Wonder Woman. Like right now.
So make some more superheroes who are women, will you? Merchandise, movies, you name it. Pleeeeeeeeeeease?
Elsa is a SUPERHERO (well, ok, super villain, really, *cough cough*) who is a WOMAN. And Disney has made so MUCH money.
Hey. Hey hey. Movie makers? Do you see how much money Frozen has made? My kid has told me she likes Else bc she can "freeze things."
@luckyturner @LouisatheLast @FeministaJones That joke in GotG still makes me SO angry, in a movie I otherwise enjoyed.
@libraryyeti Snow cones taste better than people, anyway. 
@libraryyeti Like in Little Shop of Horrors?
@libraryyeti Oh crap the baby is asleep in my lap and I'm going to wake her up with laughing.
@libraryyeti I have SO MANY questions.
@OhDianeMarie @sassycrass Seconded. I'm over here... waiting for the next tweet. Why do you do this to me??
Getting sucked into saying "well, nobody deserves harassment," when a man never even said he was harassed! bothers the crap out of me.
It was always associated with "but all these other people have it worse!" but still.
Discussing that Whedon "should never get harassed" when that harassment was basically hypothetical.
I'm not just talking about the MRAs. I'm a little unnerved by the amount of time that was spent in my feed yesterday
People rose to defend Whedon, who said he wasn't harassed off Twitter, but won't rise to the defense of women who DO say they're harassed.
No Steven Universe for youuuuuuu....
Well, damn. No sooner had I decided to watch one ep of Steven Universe and go to bed, toddler starts crying. She's psychic, I tell you.
@kingdomofwench OMG the "I want to go to bed but there are no clean sippy cups" game. UGHHHH.
@sassycrass &lt;3
@crystalbflat Yeah. Just wanted you to know I've been thinking of you, and I'm rooting for you. &lt;3
@BatgirlBobbi I mean, I immediately showed her (again, she's seen it before, but not in months) the Cookie Monster version.
@BatgirlBobbi I mean, *I* can expose her to silly pop songs at home... :P
@BatgirlBobbi Mostly it's the idea that it's an expensive preschool where she's supposed to be learning stuff I can't teach her.
@crystalbflat *hugs*
Preschooler came home singing "call me baby" because apparently they listen to Carly Rae Jepsen at her school now? I... have mixed feelings.
@toomuchaubrey I think coffee is SO normalized it is really hard to say "nope, doesn't work for me."
Anxiety: Making Things Worse For Ashleigh Since 1989.
Days like this I am so annoyed with my yesterday self. Soooo annoyed.
Getting dressed this morning, aiming more than usual for the style "invisible." Siiiigh.
@Kishmishiani This is the appropriate response.
@OhDianeMarie @Kishmishiani The world is full of strange creatures that will happily devour us if we let them! Grosssssss.
@Kishmishiani I'm only scared of tiny tiny things, but still that is Gross. And strangely hypnotic.
@Kishmishiani How was that link worse than I expected??? What??
I should never ever drink coffee to counteract anxious depression. Why do I always try it?
Now I am not sleeping, anxious about my kid's performance tomorrow, the dishes are not done anyway, and just spiraling. Arrgh.
Seriously. I got overwhelmed this weekend and was turtling, but was all "I need to clean this house!!" and have effed myself up even worse.
Some day I will finally stop trying to use caffeine to fix depressed lack of productivity. Now I'm just not sleeping AND being unproductive.
@rtgarden I love her plan, but figuring out how to even do just the clothes with a 2 yo around... I don't know how to do it. :)
@rtgarden And I have so much to let go of. So much. I don't even know how to do it.
@rtgarden &lt;3 I really liked that book. Finding uninterrupted time to do what she suggests is so hard, though.
AM I DOING THIS THING RIGHT 
@Veeren_Jubbal Aw, of course. Cool/kind uncles are the best.
Honest truth: 4 yo started talking about how she and 1 yo are cuties lately, and who I thought of was @Veeren_Jubbal.
You know what? Since it's #MayThe4thBeWithYou, I'm going to make it clear: Return of the Jedi is my favorite. So there.
&gt; a long term wish for a large, not-for-profit, community of support and education that was centered on women and femme-identified folks.
Basically, I wrote a 6 pg long Google doc setting out a short term wish (an online SJ weekly support group), and &gt;
Hey, so I am working on developing an online support group. If you are interested, you're welcome to DM me for more info.
@OtherFemme You cannot really separate them - because they overlap and intersect - but it's hard to grapple with both at once.
@OtherFemme No that's cool! I struggle a lot with how critiques of capitalism and other things intersect with feminism.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits the kids themselves or mocking what the kids like. And I do see it sometimes.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits Frankly, I think stuff can work for both kids and adults, IF the adult jokes aren't rooted in mocking either
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits Wow, never thought of that.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits *nods* Yes.
Nowadays I translate my husband saying "there is some truth to that" to: "your logic is undeniable and glaring like the sun." ;D
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits I couldn't really have told you why Han Solo was in carbonite at the beginning of RotJ for a lot of years.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits I think I'm overstating it - I understood a lot, but there was a *lot* I missed completely.
@MarkGerrits @SpinsterAndCat Great point! If you're constantly growing (&amp; so many of us aspire to that) then that makes perfect sense.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits Which, as a parent, I haven't figured out how to act on, really, but I feel like I should...
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits Plot and long character development really mean nothing when you're young enough.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits They were just collections of scenes and characters.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits I think a lot about how I watched some movies as a kid and didn't comprehend them *at all* until adulthood.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits ***sigh*** My 4 yo is the Frozen generation.
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits Maybe I'm too young to like the first one best? (Born in 82)
@SpinsterAndCat @MarkGerrits I like RotJ best bc I watched it repeatedly as a kid.
@OtherFemme And happy to talk any time! :)
@OtherFemme Well, yes, once we start talking about how feminism intersects we capitalism it gets messy super quick.
@unxpctdblessing Congrats!!
@OtherFemme But when many of those power structures are based on exactly that - policing and shaming individuals - hmm.
@OtherFemme I wish we could say "hey, sometimes all the choices are crappy, so let's not police the choices of individuals."
@OtherFemme When you put it that way - as women trying to leverage systems not built for them - it makes it clear there will be problems.
@OtherFemme That's a way of putting it that I like and haven't heard quite that way before, thanks for sharing. :)
@OtherFemme Not at all. :)
The idea I making that an *either/or* construction actually baffles me a bit. Why?
I'd like feminism that both supports individual women in their choices AND fights for meaningful improvement in quality of those choices.
Then I give *myself* the hard time about it, "oh, what? they need to throw a woman in this pack of criminals and you'll be happy?"
So now I notice all the time. "Huh. There's like a million characters in Snatch, of all kinds, and none of them are women."
The fact that I never even thought about it. Didn't notice.
I will probably be forever unnerved that it never occurred to me that there were no women in the Hobbit.
@catinahelmet &lt;3 all of this. Thanks for saying it.
@jenrenpody Mmm! That sounds more exciting than my Cheerios. :)
Good morning! I am starving. What's for breakfast?
@nevernotdoing Thank you! My husband worked several weekends to make it happen. :)
My backyard now. 
Explaining @habitrpg to 4 yo: "It's a game for motivating me." (blank look) "It's like Clash of the Clans, but with vacuuming." "Oh, ok!"
Frankly, if you don't see that kind of humility as an ideal, I want nothing to do with you as my therapist or in pastoral care.
Acting like people are the experts in their own lives, even when we think they are fucking up, is the kind of humility I'm talking about.
If you don't have a good answer to that question, you will do harm as a therapist. Or frankly, as a friend.
I get that people do lie, but if you just leave it at that - "people lie" - then what happens to the ones who aren't lying?
(BTW, I think that applies to pastoral care and ministry as well. Humility, and the ability to think critically on your experiences.)
Therapy is crucial &amp; important. I think humility in it  is SO important AND the ability to learn from &amp; process what you hear from clients.
No. No no no no no no no.
They've set up a model for how a certain kind of patient works, and anyone who doesn't fit that model is just lying. HULK SMASH
It is the kind of patronizing arrogance that I think is one of the biggest problems with our mental health system.
So they argued for patience. ... Which, on the face of it, seems compassionate and useful... but ... (3)
They then argued that, if asked about such things, these people will generally lie. Because of shame. (2)
(TW: ED, self harm) They argued that ppl with eating disorders and self-cutting behaviors have often been raped, assaulted or abused. (1)
I want to address something I saw someone say here. This is from someone in training to be a therapist.
@kingdomofwench (you have a ONE YEAR OLD WHAT) ... Carry on.
@unholyglee @angelsscream Is that her plan with the potato salad? (Seriously, I'm sorry. Leaving treats on the floor. I cannot handle it.)
Thing that just came out of my mouth to the 4 yo: "Just because it's a good idea doesn't mean you can steal it."
@runningnekkid Yay! Awesome. :)
@runningnekkid I emailed a link to a Google Doc w some thorough thoughts on the website idea. No rush to read, but thought I'd tell you. :)
@emilytheslayer Hugs for brain weasels that make tough things worse. Been there.
@OhDianeMarie Thinking of you today, hon.
My options were teachers/parents trying to teach/fix/control, or alone.
Of course, I feel complicated saying that, bc one of the things I am trying to process is just how alone I was as a kid.
Friday has this frisson of hope to me bc when I was a kid if meant being at home and no one would mess with me. No school.
There's no room in my life for that. I built it that way - it has small kids and a narcissistic husband.
I still do not have any skills for compassionately changing gears, checking in, taking a step back when I'm struggling.
I always feel like "success" is hiding that I'm struggling, is making sure that my problems don't cause anyone else inconvenience.
I've been depressed/anxious for a few days. I'm so good at coping with this stuff and continuing to move forward, but
However, Friday still gives me hope for some reason. Even when my husband was deployed, &amp; there was zero difference from day to day, it did.
But marriage, and then kids, meant that weekends are not so much a break but just a different kind of work.
Long, long, long ago, I looked forward to Fridays.
@rabcyr It freaks me out how hard people will argue that it's not really about race. Of course it is.
&gt; My husband would victim blame his brother if something happened to him - but the point is something won't, because he's white.
@rabcyr Yeah. I don't know. I kept telling him it was about race. It's about being treated differently on the basis of race.
&gt; One of my husband's brothers has a longer record than I bet Freddie Gray had. &gt;
&gt; I don't pretend to know everything, but I see people just asking to stop being killed extrajudicially. That's it. Simple. &gt;
&gt; So, "really," the protests are about poverty, which is something white people can get their minds around? &gt;
&gt; According to husband, Freddie Gray had a record, and therefore isn't sympathetic, so you have to go "oh poverty gave him no options."&gt;
&gt; According to him, he thought he might have sort of convinced them with that? But I'm deeply uncomfortable with that tactic. &gt;
&gt; According to him this group of women was completely negative about it, but he leaned hard on how the protests were "really about poverty"&gt;
So the husband came home talking about how he defended the "rioting" in Baltimore at work today against a group of white women. &gt;
@AmFmJen Thank you. &lt;3 It got a bit better - finally got them focused on a project.
Both my kids have been screaming at me since I picked up the preschooler an hour and a half ago. Completely overwhelmed.
- is the way to do it. At all.
I don't think having the good luck of a wildly successful kickstarter - &amp; then refusing to consider changing how much you give back to ppl -
I believe there are ways to live ethically, and ask for grace and undeserved help. I believe that.
@randomjeweler *nods* Grumping is totally ok with me, food related or not.
Life is wild and unfair in both terrible and magical ways.
@randomjeweler Well, I do feel everything is fuckery right now, but I was kind of trying to be hopeful?
Fair implies that there's no need for gratitude, that there's no responsibility to find ways to pay forward, above &amp; beyond.
But it's not "fair." Fair implies that everything that has happened to Palmer is deserved, that she's just that awesome as opposed to lucky.
And there is an "exchange" when someone gives graciously, freely, undeservedly, that does them good and does us good. It's good.
The whole point of a lot of asking for help and grace is that it's not "deserved." No one owes it to us!
Palmer going to "well, it's fair, you just don't get it" is so not ok I don't even know how to explain it.
The world is so profoundly unfair I can't get my head around it most of the time.
@nevernotdoing I will probably keep grappling with this until I get it into words I like. It's slippery. &lt;3
&gt; those critics don't understand the "exchange" and because it's "fair," I say NO.
But when she defends her choosing not to start paying musicians once her kickstarter is wildly successful, bc
I had avoided watching that, bc I come from the white woman role where you shouldn't ask. So learning to ask is good.
Just watched Amanda Palmer's TED talk, and my response is: No, it's not fair. You're wrong.
@rabcyr *nods* Yeah. I struggle with how to exist in the world a lot.
Which doesn't make me special. The narratives about that being "special" are excuses that let everybody else off the hook.
I really wonder sometimes how much of my problem isn't "mental illness" it's paying too much attention to what other ppl manage to ignore.
&gt; don't say the wrong thing, and my nice house that depends on not making any economic mistakes, or we'll be just the same as "them."
&gt; with my husband who is nice to me as long as he's not too afraid I'll leave him, and my white friends who are nice to me as long as I &gt;
Personally, my life is awesome. All I have to do is accept white supremacy, patriarchy, classism, ableism, and I get to live my nice life &gt;
Angry and unmoored today.
@the_author_ I wished I had a reading group or something for that one. It was more demoralizing for me than her other stuff.
@beckykid I am rolling my eyes so hard at this. Locking your kids out of their own house.
@beckykid I take it you're not expecting a conversation with them to be very productive? :/
@beckykid Do you know who the kids belong to?
@beckykid Yeah. I'm normally pretty "live and let live" parenting wise, but that sounds incredibly obnoxious.
@beckykid I'm sorry. That's frustrating.
@riotheatherrr Yes! Nicely said. Exactly.
@averrer @riotheatherrr Absolutely. It is appalling.
@riotheatherrr I worry about ppl who say "I try to be a good friend to everybody" and use that to refuse to engage with issues of privilege.
@riotheatherrr *nods* This is a big problem. I think both public and private matter, and inform each other.
@riotheatherrr But I struggle w setting this up as a binary? I think being a "good friend" can mean being visibly supportive of causes?
@riotheatherrr Ok, I completely agree that emotional abuse and one-to-one relationships matter SO much.
LRT inspired me to Google, which led to this awesome article, also about Aristotle &amp; Phyllis: 
@melissapierce I got this for my 3 yr old, and she was a little young for it. Bet an 8 yr old would love it. 
@story3girl Yeah. There's a lot of sexism that isn't malicious that still has a big effect.
@story3girl I remember reading that was a big factor in fulfillment in any job.
@story3girl Yeah. There's a larger convo about how connected most ppl, women and men, feel their work is to a larger good.
@story3girl I should say part of what drove me there. And clearly didn't keep me there!
@story3girl And that is a great point about the books. That stereotype about books vs engineering is what drove me into it in the 1st place.
@story3girl I think *any* article that theorizes about "how do we convince the wimmenz to do this??" Is patronizing to some degree. :)
You know what happens when that is your writing process? 5 min at a time? You have a Twitter acct and that's it. 

Hi.
"Write in the time you have." Some of the people saying this really mean write in the five minutes of peace you have between things.
Sigh. My tendency is to dig deeply into thinking about a thing, and a lot of the advice about writing with kids doesn't work with that.
@story3girl Ok, I could say more, but that's enough, I think? :P &lt;3 &lt;3 What did you think, as somebody who is not an engineer?
@story3girl would look like mentorship and battling sexism, etc.) things would change.
@story3girl instead shift your culture so that it is more collaborative, and that each woman feels needed and valued in the field, (which
@story3girl 3) I think if you take this point and instead of trying to rewrite some assignments to make them about social problems, but
@story3girl I felt like engineering was plenty important - I just never found that *I* was needed. They didn't need *me.*
@story3girl 2) There's this tone like they just have to somehow sell it differently and then women will care. Which feels patronizing.
@story3girl My undergrad major was 50% women. I doubt the percentage of those ppl still in the field who are women is still 50%.
@story3girl But 1) I'm skeptical nowadays of any statistic based on college anything w/o followup, bc retention later is a huge problem.
@story3girl I think it's true that we socialize women to "do good" more than we do men. And that's worth paying attention to.
@story3girl Hmm. That's a take I haven't heard before. I think they're taking an interesting observation and failing to unpack it.
I am very grateful to Twitter, so I have answers and arguments when my husband says things about Baltimore.
We have white friends who live in Baltimore. No idea how I'm going to talk to them about any of this.
Huh, the reason I thought it was so early was bc the clocks in the kitchen were all wrong. Whoops.
Except when they pour their breakfasts in my lap. Right at that moment, toddler was not my favorite.
Ok, not everything. Just maybe almost everything about being a mom in this society. Except my actual children. I like those.
I hate everything.
I not only did not find the info I needed, I ended up w Cheerios in my lap. Both the kid &amp; I needed to change clothes, wasting earlier work.
Related: I was eating breakfast, and trying to monitor my toddler eating, and thought hey! I need to figure out where to get lighting today.
Also, it's just flat wrong. They've done research that "multitasking" is terribly inefficient.
Like, if I wasn't trying to do three things at once, I was somehow slacking. Which is absurd. One thing at a time is enough.
I get that multitasking is often necessary. But I feel like I've received a lot of messages that it was a great way to get things done.
I want to know when we started talking about moms multitasking all the time like it was some sort of ideal.
Good morning, y'all. 
@ShutUpLucille Pretty!
I don't hate her. But man, I do get irritated with her. The way she talks makes me itch. Pushes *every* button.
My mom is so good at making me feel broken and monstrous. It's horrible. Because that's the only way she learned to interact with me.
And if that makes her sad, I don't have to feel like that's the end of my world anymore. I'm a grown up and no longer dependent on her.
I am totally allowed to decide what kind of relationship - if any - I want to have with her.
I'm a grown-ass woman. I have kids of my own. My mom doesn't owe me squat. And I don't owe *her* squat.
You know what hit me when I was in OH with the family? I can't remember if I tweeted this.
@Kishmishiani Now I want an Oreo Blizzard.
@TexasBobbi Thank you! Hugs back.
Well, it's not *all* cleaned up. Still haven't dealt with the marker in the chair.
So many gross things happened this weekend and I didn't tweet about them. I just cleaned them up. Siiigh.
@hypatiadotca I'll consider that for next time. I don't think I'd thought of that.
@sassycrass Yes! I looked up stuff about DB Cooper after seeing that ep. There were copycats! Man, 70s were *not* a good time for flying.
@randomjeweler Thank you. &lt;3 Hope you're doing all right today.
And with repeated cancellations I'm not even getting therapy out of it... Blegh.
I've often tried to look at it as "skills practice" - talking to people, asking for what I need, setting limits - but it's still exhausting.
It has often seemed painfully ironic how many people skills it takes to find a new therapist, make appointments, and arrange a sitter.
@AuntieNana2012 That's the natural response, but it took me months to find this one.
@sassycrass I mean, I like numbers and I can't even imagine a trillion dollars. It doesn't mean anything to me.
@sassycrass Also: "oh, they found it, but war is still so expensive we don't have enough zeros for these #s." SIGH.
@sassycrass I never knew that the missing money was largely Iraq's own money. And that they eventually straightened it out.
@sassycrass I loved Leverage's take on DB Cooper. :) I hate the story bc I had unsolved mysteries. I want to knoooooow.
It seems ridiculous to just say "I give up" on going to therapy. But I'm so exasperated.
It's fine for the therapist to cancel on just me, but if I have to turn around and cancel on a sitter I'm being rude to them.
The  worst part is arranging a sitter, and then canceling on that person on the last minute, as someone with social anxiety.
I haven't seen my therapist in a month and a half. She keeps messing up the schedule. I really like her, but I just want to give up trying.
@kayaoakes @TheRaDR Thank you. I'll look for it. :)
@kayaoakes Now I feel more inspired than disheartened. Thank you. :)
@kayaoakes explore from, and adults they trust to discuss spiritual issues with other than me. Cobble them together from diff places?
@kayaoakes Yes. I may just need to do some reflection on what I want. Things like: my kids to feel they have a spiritual "home base" to
@kayaoakes Hmm. That's something for me to think on. I don't know.
@kayaoakes That sounds about like what I do. That's easier for me to do online. Wish I had an option for my kids.
@kayaoakes I am currently wrestling with trying to figure out how many principles to sacrifice in the hope of community.
@kayaoakes My difficulty with this is that it leaves me without a spiritual community, something I want badly for me and my children.
@sassycrass Eh. Phooey on Nice. That's for passive aggressive white ladies. I only speak from experience. (Also, heeeeey!)
I've been done with today since 9am. And it went downhill from there. Not over yet.
Like the fact that the toddler woke up screaming and I can't figure out how to console her for more than a few minutes.
Today has just been a rolling series of awfulness. No real disasters (although a chair may have been ruined) but so much still unfixed.
@brigidkeely Trash &gt; surfing seems pretty preachy. One of the things I like about Steven Universe is nobody is perfect, not even the Gems.
@brigidkeely Your wider point is excellent. I absolutely hope as much kids TV as possible goes toward modeling.
@brigidkeely It had actual villains that liked to waste paper &amp; such. Who Captain Planet would fight. Even as a kid I thought it was silly.
@brigidkeely It might have been worse - I don't remember anyone doing anything like an actual recycling drive.
@brigidkeely This reminds me of Captain Planet.
@HanFreakinSolo @LouisatheLast Rewatched the Keaton Batman recently and the feel of "rich man beating up poor ppl for fun" is so strong.
@nevernotdoing Thanks. My nerves are just all shot today. Need today to be over. &lt;3
@nevernotdoing I might have doomed myself by already using upholstery cleaner and goo gone. But thank you. Once it dries, I might try that.
@mkhajdin &lt;3
I cannot get this dry erase marker out of this upholstery and my kids won't stop screaming and today sucks.
@mightybattlecat @saalon ::cries while trying to throw money at this fantasy:: ::cries some more::
@OhDianeMarie Slow Saturdays can be good. Especially without toddlers in the house moving at light speed... ;)
@OhDianeMarie :D I hope you are doing well, too.
@OhDianeMarie It's a career book, so I'm sort of being productive?? *ducks bc I expect you to throw something in my direction**
@OhDianeMarie I say down. I'm reading a book! Like with paper! ;)
Ok. Untrapped. Try to get things done or sit my own sick butt down on the couch and do nothing?
Ok, I am trapped under a sick sleeping toddler who I tried to put down in her bed, and failed. What's up with y'all?
@yesthataimee ((offering hugs))
Fraggle Rock is on Amazon Prime!
Wish she would. I don't think my mom knows where real is. I'm the one that stopped giving a damn and started just telling her off.
Aww, somebody on my TL talking about mom's getting old, not caring anymore, and being "real."
I know kids are naturally (and I think it's good self-protection for them, frankly, when super little) narcissists. But it is exhausting.
Now would be the time to tag in another adult but husband is at work until tomorrow morning.
I very suddenly hit my limit with being screamed at by 4 yo and I'm really angry at her and can't calm down.
@BathysphereHat @lurkeriatipsos I like "face to face" for what a lot of people use irl for, which can be shortened to f2f.
@runningnekkid OMG yes. I would be so much more ok with kiddo's obsession if Elsa was in the X-Men.
I really wish #Frozen was just all Olaf. No complaints about Olaf.
#Frozen So, Hans threatens Weselton with treason... but neither of them is an Arendelle citizen. Ummmm....
@runningnekkid Basically, I want to make an online community that has the normal message boards but also has room for "small groups."
@runningnekkid ...anyway, wanted to pester you but I worried it was going to be incoherent.
@runningnekkid YES. You get it. The trolls are so terrible.
@runningnekkid Also, speaking of things we don't have time for, I had all these thoughts today about online communities &amp; thought about
@runningnekkid OMG yes. Although Frozen is The Worst for me. The Worst.
Ok, the scene in the sled is cute but the wolves need to just not be in it. I hate wolves used like this. A lot. #Frozen
@runningnekkid Right? As it is he is totally superfluous.
@runningnekkid I am thrilled I am no the only one who has tried to mentally rewrite this movie. &lt;3
.@runningnekkid That scene with Hans is just out of NOWHERE. The first time I watched it I was ok with it, but on repetition I *hate* it.
@runningnekkid YESSSS. That would have been SO much better.
I actually would be okay with both the "love" song and "let it go" in the plot if they were adequately followed up on. #frozen
@runningnekkid :D :D :D
#Frozen made a lot more sense when I learned they completely rewrote the plot from Elsa being a traditional villain. It needed more work.
#frozen "Love is an open door" is a catchy song and all, but um, it's so confusing when held up against the rest of the movie.
#Frozen (spoiler) I mean, Bruce Wayne has Alfred. Peter Parker has his aunt and uncle. Who's minding the store once they're orphans?
I always wonder who's running the country before Elsa is crowned. #Frozen
I hate the trolls so much. "Here, let me show you this frightening light show and tell you fear is your enemy. Ok, go home." #Frozen
4 yo wants to watch #Frozen again, so um, there may be :slightly: grumpy live tweeting. Be warned.
@glassblowerscat That's more of a chance than most people would give to something they weren't really feeling. :)
@glassblowerscat Now I'm curious to watch Adventure a Time and compare. :)
@glassblowerscat As far as I can tell, SU is a little bit sweeter, while still being a bit weird, if that makes sense?
@glassblowerscat Fair. I know the creator used to be part of AT? I've only watched clips of AT, but it's not really my thing.
@glassblowerscat :) If you liked Big Hero 6, I suspect you'll like it. It's definitely weirder, but along those lines.
@glassblowerscat I'm watching it through Amazon. It's not free with Prime, but I paid for the first season and haven't regretted it.
@glassblowerscat I was looking for things that were kid-friendly. It is that, but also really fun on it's own merits.
@glassblowerscat Agreeeed.
@glassblowerscat True! But have you seen Steven Universe? I watched most of the first season in the last day. Ten minute chunks...
@glassblowerscat I would LOVE a BH6 series. That would be awesome.
@glassblowerscat Which is a LOT because of format, I think. A single movie just can't do what a series can.
@glassblowerscat Yes, and there are things I love about that movie, but on the friendship angle, SU &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BH6.
Basically I want my own superhero team, I guess?
Steven Universe puts me all in my feelings about wishing I had people around who loved me just as I was, both as a kid &amp; as an adult.
@quicksilvre Hahaha.
No, YOU have a snotty toddler persistently trying to stick a red crayon up your nose.
@LouisatheLast I will be your happy sidekick in this noble quest.
@LouisatheLast Thank you for recommending it! &lt;3
@LouisatheLast This show is so adorably weird and heartwarming in all the right ways.
@LouisatheLast "Now we have new memories. Horrible, horrible memories." I die.
I want an online network that has the usual message boards/groups, but also has mechanisms for small groups.
@nevernotdoing Awww.
@nevernotdoing :D
@nevernotdoing *cough* This might have been my morning. *cough*
In truth, I hope for her to succeed on her terms and for her to support me in succeeding on mine. I hope for that.
That's often meant carrying the weight of my sister's mostly unspoken conviction that she was going to do just as good or better.
I've spent so much energy trying to succeed as a mom on my own terms - which is hard.
I texted her back support like the big sister I want to be, but just in typing out those two tweets it's clear I have some pain to work out.
I admit, guiltily, there was a part of me that worried she was going to do "better" than me like she has at everything else.
My sister texted me about how she "so thought she was going to be a better mom than this." I admit it, I laughed out loud.
I am here for feminism that embraces every darn mother out there. Even that one. Yeah, that one you're thinking of right now. Yup, her.
... those that aren't. Those that aren't tend not to get deep enough to do anything but move the shaming to a weaker target than themselves.
... it's an intersectional feminist issue. There's a very large divide between those I know who are comfortable talking about it that way &amp;
Something just clicked for me. The dialogue around PPD and mom's mental health nags at me bc it's usually missing the dimension that ...
@amaditalks @redbeansrule Yes, ableism has affected my relationship to mothering a lot. Still trying to understand and unpack that.
@redbeansrule do half measures of accepting other moms that I think ultimately reinforce the shaming in subtle ways.
@redbeansrule I struggle bc I think I lot of my white friends aren't comfortable w the language of oppression or feminism, and so they
@redbeansrule Hear hear. I wish we were more explicit about that more often.
"Twitter feminism" means the same thing as "toxic Twitter," right? As in, I should avoid people complaining about it?
@dangermee ::hugs::
@LouisatheLast @nevernotdoing :D :D :D
@nevernotdoing Right? 4 yo will watch Strawberry Shortcake on repeat if I let her. Her new thing is Dora. :::sigh:::
@nevernotdoing I like it. 4 yo is not so impressed.
@nevernotdoing I *just* watched this. &lt;3
I do kind of wish Steven was a girl...
Started Steven Universe. It's adorable. I understand the love.
It makes me extra sad that the actor that plays ^^Captain America^^ is in trouble for a sexist joke. Captain America.
@rabcyr I admit I've tried to keep 2 yo from figuring out the fridge bc she would just eat cheese. I have lost that battle with 4 yo. ;)
@rabcyr 4 yo is busily trying to learn both these things. :) :) 2 yo is too busy standing on me and giving me boogery kisses. :P
@rabcyr &lt;3 With all of us sick, I feel like a lump and can't think straight. The day is moving like molasses, but I can't sleep bc kids.
I realized in my sick cranky state that I just want someone to listen to me for a few minutes and treat me like I'm awesome.
@runningnekkid Thank you for the work of sharing. &lt;3
@mazzie Sweet. :) I'm trying to figure out when, but will definitely be down at some point. I'll let you know. :)
@Jenny_Trout This is pretty much why my husband says the entire internet is "not real."
87% of my heart is loving @libraryyeti's #fakestats SO MUCH rn. #truestats #noreallythatnumberissoverytrue
@mazzie (coffee that will likely include a 4 yo and a 2 yo, fair warning)
@mazzie A million hugs! Hey, if I head down to see family in the DC area some weekend this summer, do you want to get coffee?
@mazzie Although I've scrolled back and it seems like Krakauer was doing well? (((More hugs)))
@mazzie (((hugs))) I'm not listening this time, was just assuming Rehm was being tone deaf again.
@mazzie I am so done with them on those types of issues. Done.
I guess I should say that was basically my whole goal for him going to this program, and it sort of seems to be working. ::crosses fingers::
So when I get irritated with him, sometimes it clicks together.
I feel like one of the nicest things about him going to this group program is that he hears similar stuff to what I say in another setting.
So update on the husband: he apologized today. And actually had at least some idea what he was apologizing for.
@stuckinspincycl :( :( :(
@saalon &lt;3
@nevernotdoing Ah. Looks like it works only on Android. I use a dreaded Apple product. ;)
@nevernotdoing I always try those things and then can't keep up with them, somehow. :)
@nevernotdoing What do you think of Google Opinion Rewards?
@LouisatheLast @AdviceChicken Awesome!! Thank you. &lt;3 Was looking into it after I saw you talking about it. :)
@AdviceChicken @LouisatheLast You think it's okay for a 4yo to watch with me?
@nevernotdoing Hmmm. I have never used Google Play. Never saw a reason. I'll look into it more now. Thanks. :)
So is Steven Universe awesome enough that I should spend the money to buy the first season on Amazon video?
@_L1vY_ Me too. Hope the congestion gets better for your little person, too.
@_L1vY_ Aww. &lt;3
@story3girl &lt;3 &lt;3
Me and both kids are sick. I always wish for my electric grandmother at these times.
@_L1vY_ ((hugs)) I have a little person not sleeping well due to us all having colds. &lt;3
@kingdomofwench Who does?? (See also, why I have not read many of the classics.)
I don't care if he agrees with me. I care that he actually treats me like a sensible person whose opinions matter, and engages with them.
My husband is arguing like there is no other option other than knee jerk defensiveness whenever I criticize his behavior.
If I think someone I'm close with is calling me arrogant *just to make me feel bad* then I probably should not be close with them anymore!
It may turn out I disagree with their assessment, but I'll appreciate the honesty.
I'm going to assume they are sharing something they think is important, not just trying to be mean.
I'm going to look really darn hard at that. I'm going to try to understand where they're coming from.
I'm so over this. Listen, if somebody who I'm supposedly close with says I have done something arrogant -
So fucking livid right now. No, no, no, no, no. So tired of this shit.
@Layogenic No, I think you're talking about some nuance I hadn't thought about before. Takes a few tweets. :)
@Layogenic Oh, now I really wish you had seen/could see the X-Files episode. :)
@Layogenic Interesting. And definitely has some powerful metaphorical dimensions, as you say. :)
@Layogenic What do you think of the trope of all the wishes going wrong before setting her free (thinking X-Files specifically)?
You can. You're going to classes to learn another way. Don't make it my fault for telling you I found your behavior/opinions offensive.
Last two convos have ended with him declaring helplessness bc he "can't help" but be defensive.
He believes he's having a political exchange of ideas and I just see disgusting arrogance that devolves into abuse when challenged.
I just - I think I'm just going to check out of these convos much earlier from now on. Fuck this.
... He responds by proceeding to trash the researcher as a "journalist" (who he had formerly said he identified with). I am so angry.
Update: convo resumed, I pointed out arrogance I see in husbands comparing his lazy white boy opinions to those of an academic researcher...
If I did, of course, I'd have to bring my children, who are the ones screaming.
So much screaming today in my house. I just want to go somewhere else.
&amp; instead of realizing he has more in common with the opportunistic right wingers who jump on her "side," he identifies with her. &gt;.&gt;
I mean, seriously, my husband reads an article about someone who does years of research and ends up taking a stance unpopular with liberals
@Layogenic So much yes to the "intelligent" and "logical" crap. This idea that you don't need actual information, just logic.
@Layogenic It's the arrogance. He reads the news, so his opinions on every issue are equivalent to assertions of a researcher.
@kingdomofwench Yeah, pretty much.
@Layogenic &lt;3 My husband is just annoying bc he's comparing his lazy white boy racism with a woman doing actual research.
Me: [death glare]
Ofc, my single text at the beginning about identifying w her bc she calls herself a "stay at home" parent wasn't even worth acknowledging.
He "identifies" with her. Yes, dude, bc you're a historian who researches something for 3 years and then takes a controversial stance.
Accidentally texted my husband an article about a researcher controversial in the trans community, and got a text wall back about how
Canada: (877) 330-6366
 Share it, use it if you're Trans. You matter.
@rabcyr :P
Gives me chills.
Manolo's scene with the bull &gt;&gt;&gt; Anna saving Elsa.
Book of Life &gt;&gt;&gt; Frozen.
@kingdomofwench ::hates everything::
Since she's actually *in* the wedding, I want to put some thought into it.
Any websites for kids that I might not have heard of? I might brave the mall, but I need to do some browsing first and get some ideas.
Ok, y'all. I need to buy preschooler a dress to be a flower girl for a wedding , and the bride's not picking it like I assumed she was.
@tauriqmoosa This sounds awesome. I say let's try it, and the women can let them know if we hate it *when we can actually get them do it.*
@BartoszScheller I even watched the spinoff Disney movies that just had Ewoks.
@BartoszScheller :shrug: I get that ESB is supposedly so awesome, but little kid me is all about the Ewoks. Whatevs.
@BartoszScheller Well, if we're talking "appeals to a little girl," just judging by number of viewings I remember, order is RotJ, ANH, ESB.
Meanwhile, RotJ? Ok, sure, metal bikini, but Leia *kills* Jabba the Hutt. And shoots guns. And makes alliances with Ewoks.
Frozen repeats the age-old "sacrifice as love." Sacrifice till it kills you. Then everything will magically get better.
Worse from a role model perspective, I mean.
I watched Return of the Jedi a *lot* of times as a kid. I go back and forth about whether that was worse than Frozen.
@GailSimone When I was a kid, I just focused on the Ewoks. As an adult, Luke is way too whiney.
It just needed some more rewrites. Like they would have done at Pixar. Ahem. #Frozen
Watching #Frozen again. Because I'm trying to bribe sick kid to drink water. Failing at the water and the movie is still annoying.
Even ppl who lean "pro-life" are disturbed when researchers communicate the real landscape of abortion restrictions: 
@Kishmishiani Happy you have a good therapist on your side and sending you ALLLL the love.
Which just makes me think that the solution to the lack of superhero stuff for girls is to make it. To just blatantly rip it off at times.
Sooo there's a story about how the whole Disney Princess thing started when someone high up noticed homemade princess costumes at an event.
@rtgarden Yes, but the kids really aren't the trouble in my house. It's the adults. ;)
@rtgarden Also, yes, toddlers and tidy do not really go together. ;)
@rtgarden I bet you would like this book. It is a lovely, calming, empowering perspective. 
@LouisatheLast Let me know if you like it, too! I'm curious what other people think. :)
@JoVanEvery Thank you!! Spring has me very motivated. :)
@LouisatheLast I really liked the book. Quick read, too.
@JoVanEvery Thank you! :)
@LouisatheLast :) This one: 
Plus I paid bills and bought a domain name. So much adulting right now.
Finished that book on tidying, &amp; was so encouraged I picked up the whole living room &amp; cleaned the kitchen better than it's been in months.
Currently watching one on New York with a sick cranky kid leaning on me.
I found out from a thread on Shakesville that Ken Burns documentaries are available on Amazon Prime. Lots of options.
@bookworm190 That title made me check to make sure this isn't April Fool's.
@quicksilvre All the gold stars! &lt;3
All right. I have sticks in my eyes, finally  (does anybody else use that phrase?). Going to bed.Take care of yourselves. :)
@TexasBobbi I understand. It's always an adjustment.
@TexasBobbi Aww. I hope you can sleep soon. I finally just got sleepy a few minutes ago. Warm milk helps me. &lt;3
@mazzie Nah. You gotta show us whipper snappers life ain't over at 35. ;)
@mazzie Awww. That's cool. :)
@mazzie So... what's the deets on dating? I hope they're nice. :)
@mazzie Right?? Like a sunflower. So nice.
@mazzie Ew, sick. :( But yay for dating! Cool.
@mazzie Seriously, my life is Ze Same as it was 2-3 weeks ago except Sunshine and Grass and it's like I started happy pills.
@mazzie Howzit with you?
@mazzie Hey! &lt;3 I'm doing all right. Spring and sunshine make me so much happier.
So, what's up?
Hulu is showing me bizarre security messages and crashing. No more Empire for me. :(
@OhDianeMarie ALSO I finished the dishes and was all "it's late!" It's prolly Cool Peeps on Twitter Time! And I was right. ;)
@OhDianeMarie I sort of like "race traitor" when I see it in bios on Twitter for WP.
@randomjeweler ;)
In Other News, Empire is also on Hulu and the pilot was awesome.
Husband gives very serious, rather lengthy explanation of how Family Guy &amp; The Simpsons are very different in {tone}. Me: [death glare] 2/2
Me: It's everywhere. I mean The Simpsons and The Family Guy are basically the same show. 2/

@story3girl Thanks. Huge hugs.
@story3girl She didn't even look our way, but I feel super guilty. Trying to just feel guilty and learn from it and not puddle into shame.
@story3girl showed up as we were walking out - I had partially blocked her reserved spot bc of rushing. Woooops.

@story3girl I wasn't sure we were going to leave at all this morning, so maybe I've just achieved past suitably low expectations? &lt;3
@story3girl I am remarkably cheerful about it. Playing games with the girls in the car. :) &lt;3
@story3girl Love you too! &lt;3 Hope your Monday is off to a slightly better start than ours. Pouring rain and standstill traffic. :P
Ok, I basically just summed up my entire life from middle school on in the last two tweets. 0.o
2) When it fails, leave me feeling that there is something fundamentally wrong with me as a person, *and* that I am unfixable.
Is 1) likely to fail, bc it's based on changing things that, if they change at all, change on their own timetable out of our control and
Anything based on changing me as a person - in terms of my own internal values and wants and dreams -
I think a good way to judge advice &amp; "help" is if it allows me room or the skills to become and unearth more of *myself.*
Then maybe one day I can learn to do makeup in a way *I* like, as well...
Learn, as an adult, to follow my *own* standards about what I want and don't want.
This book's focus on an intuitive, personal standard of "does it spark joy?" has me hopeful I can work through that and
I have spent my whole life trying to doggedly set up fortresses and walls around my things as a defense of my self.
I realized I was panicked at the idea of "tidy," bc it meant to me that I had thrown away a whole lot of things by someone else's standard.
In this organizing book, she asks you to imagine what your place would look "tidied," what you would have in it, how it would feel.
I often heard from them the implicit assumption that there is a "right" way to live, be, do, want.
I not only felt shame that I wasn't good at these things - and often these books can be shaming in covert and overt ways -
I realized at some point that I avoided books on organizing, makeup, cleaning, etiquette, because
Update on the organizing book - actually more hopeful reading it than I have *ever* been reading a book like this.
@glassblowerscat See the tweet that follows that. ;) (So far I'm intrigued, but I'm not very far into it.)
I read that, and I was like, OK! Let's read what this lady has to say. ;)
I'm skeptical of all organizing experts, but I just want to share the line in the sample that made me buy the book: 
So, started reading a book called "the life-changing magic of the art of tidying up" yesterday. 
Fuck this. I need to stop screwing around and blog again. Have two posts I could write right now. Aargh.
UUism has a history as a refuge for people harmed by other faiths. I think it needs to learn how to reconcile when UUism did the harming.
Anyway, clearly going to church gave me some fuel for my mind and my spirit, which was reassuring to find it could still do that. #UU
One of those visions is affirming, one of those visions is terrifying. Which is why I have such mixed feelings about "God is love."
Or are we all going to heaven, because God will shape us into what they want, by hook or by crook, eventually??
Are we all going to heaven, because God affirms us and loves us in following our own spirit, in doing what we think is best?
As someone who is very sensitive to coercion, even when it's called "love," well - I'm not sure about this idea.
Rev. Reed talked about the "last sinner," dragged into heaven "by the collar."
I struggle with the idea. As said this morning, it sort of eliminates the idea of free will. We are all going to heaven, like it or not!
Universalism's radical message, historically, is that "God is love," and that there is *nothing* we can do that will lose that love.
Universalism is the more working class half of the faith, the more emotional, less intellectual.
Went into a UU church for the first time in two years to hear Rev. Mark Morrison Reed speak on Universalism. Was lovely.
Sermon was great though - visiting speaker, the real reason I chose to go today.
Longest convo I had was with a lovely woman who actually has been attending only a few months. :/
I wasn't really up for the "new person" enthusiasm today, so it's ok that this place basically ignored me on that front today.
+ judging critically how well they do making visitors feel welcome.
In fact, as somebody who was head of the Newcomer/Membership committee at my former fellowship, I'm used to going to a new place and +
My last tweet doesn't explain how I feel. I'm used to going to new UU churches - visiting, moving.
@freckles42 Thank you! I'm glad I went. The advantage of living here is I have choices of other UU congregations to visit. We'll see.
I was surprised by how familiar it felt to be in a UU church again. So strange to be a stranger to this congregation but not UUism.
@glassblowerscat It was nice. The rituals of church can be very reassuring.
Visiting a UU church for the first time since I left my old one on bad terms. Butterflies, but also some hope. Determination.
@ZippyKittyToo Good luck! I am jealous. :)
@ZippyKittyToo That sounds excellent. Hopefully they will enjoy it once you get there?
@ZippyKittyToo Go knit in a cafe? ;)
@peacefultaru I really hope things get a little easier soon. Hugs hugs hugs.
@peacefultaru HUGS
I have strawberries and greens, and that sounds really good, but nothing else I have really goes with that, and it's not enough.
I am tired and hot, and trying to make a salad for dinner, and I don't love any of my ideas. And husband is... husband.
@rtgarden Thank you. &lt;3
Me: (sad) my friend keeps having her work online go unrecognized or straight up stolen. Him: eh. The internet's not real. Me: (death glare)
I need regular convos with someone OTHER than my husband on social issues. Beyond Twitter. Twitter is great, but I need more.
@toomuchaubrey Thank you. I have had so few friendships that I don't have much experience with this.
I tried so hard. I don't know what else I could have done and still respect myself, but I still have a nagging fear that I'm just terrible.
Trying to just let myself be sad, and not beat up on myself anymore that it is like this.
Missing a friend this morning. Trying to accept that the relationship will probably not ever be repaired.
I don't even know if we HAVE sunscreen. I don't know where any of the hats are.
It's only April. Damn you, Philadelphia. (I mean. Awesome! But I'm not ready.)
Crap it's supposed to be 79. This involves shorts and sunscreen. I Have forgotten how to do summer.
@glassblowerscat Hi Ryan! So much simpler this way. :)
Just genuine social change. I can't think of any books that are like that.
I want to write utopian fiction. I want to write how to get from here to something better, not through some magical trick or aliens, but
@VeryWhiteGuy I'll look for it, thanks. :)
@VeryWhiteGuy Thank you for your voice on this. I'm still struggling with how to interact with national UUism on this. @UUA
But I admit I would happily endorse a gov that took away Alice Walton's money, since all she did to deserve it was be a Wal-Mart heir.
I still have a lot of internalized social Darwinism I'm fighting with, that rears its head when I think about things like minimum income.
I just can no longer accept a belief system that says that Bill Gates *deserves* $78.3 billion in wealth and other people deserve to starve.
Spent the last 30 min playing with numbers. Just upset myself.
@smartstatistic I hate how much energy we spend focused on ppl like Paltrow and not on ppl they're supposedly building "awareness" for.
@smartstatistic Would love to read it. I'm grateful when people put in the effort to share their experience about stuff like that.
@smartstatistic Right! Which is gross.
@CFB_law Yeah, raising awareness would mean something new, and other people have done what she did before.
Fantasizing now of getting celebrities to do a #30PercentChallenge for a week. Raise awareness of how food pantries need cashola &amp; not cans.
Oh, sorry, Forbes link for GP's income in 2014, I got all excited and didn't actually include it: 
I think I have to stop now because I have entirely too much "awareness" of how absurd the inequality in our system is.
If GP donated that $110,000, that could give 2,400 **other** people $45 to eat for a week.
30% of that is $110,000. That is what GP could spend in a WEEK on FOOD by their budget. The $45 SNAP benefit is a rounding error.
According to this, GP made $19 mil last year. Divide by 52 weeks: $365,000.
To a food pantry. Donate everything over the maximum SNAP allotment, which is $45 a month. 
So now I propose that some celebrities do the math the other way. They calculate 30% of their income, used donate everything OVER that
If a family doesn't make enough that 30% will pay for reasonably healthful food, it tries to cover the gap. 
SNAP estimates that it's reasonable for families to spend about 30% of their income on food. 
It's that they have SO MUCH that food, even when they live lavishly, just isn't that much of their budget.
So that idea is ok, as far as it goes, but I got to thinking about how the real problem isn't that the super rich spend so much on food.
Even if GP had "succeeded" at the SNAP challenge, unless she donated the diff all she has done is live frugally for a week.
One of my biggest issues with most "challenges" like this is that there is no direct benefit to anyone actually suffering.
Between that and what she would get from SNAP to a food pantry, in cash. Food pantries don't get enough cash donations.
Ok. So in response to the Gwyneth Paltrow SNAP thing, I suggested figuring out what she spends on food normally, and donating the diff +
@so_treu Happy Birthday!
@nanayasleeps Ugh. I'm sorry.
@summerasana My condolences! Why couldn't they all be obsessed w Brave, or something else? ::sigh::
@sassycrass by her own kind, just let me and @OhDianeMarie know. Damn it.
@sassycrass I know, I know, this is SO much bigger than this one presenter, but if you ever deem it useful for this WW to be collected
@sassycrass You know you could figure it out, and they wouldn't credit you for that either. I am so frustrated for you right now.'g
@Layogenic Ha! Probably. ;)
It's so so rare for me to let myself just look forward to something. I learned to plan for the worst, keep expectations low, etc.
I keep thinking of Winnie-the-Pooh. There was something in one of the books about how anticipation can be better than a thing.
Just remembered there were cannolis in my fridge and it made me so happy.
When I get my new blog rolling I'm going to have to have a regular feature where I talk about kids TV/movies.
Prob w watching media w my kid: Kid doesn't care abt plot, nonparents don't care abt the movie, &amp; here I am ready to write an opus. #frozen
I keep trying to rewrite it in my head, bc the theme of "letting go" of fear &amp; shame is important to me, and they utterly botch it. #frozen
I hate the way the entire conflict of the movie is resolved, nothing anybody does make sense on further examination. #Frozen
On repeated exposure to Frozen, my initial "oh, that has some interesting twists" has turned into hatred of everything about the plot.
Ok I admit it I watches the trailer for Star Wars and got a little excited even though I *know* it will be terrible.
I will not eat them, because saving them so that the husband can eat one. Because I'm sweet like that.
I am stuck in the car outside the house with a sleeping toddler, and these cannolis I bought keep singing to me.
@brassiest Yay! Glad that worked out.
@beckykid Hugs for a broken night!
@BadHg21 Good morning! Hope you have a good day. :)
@mkhajdin Morning! Hugs for no coffee.
@TX_Lisa I'm fighting for myself. I've tried everything else. I'm ok with that. I appreciate the support.
@TX_Lisa That's a burden on you, and your kids, that I wish wasn't there.
@TX_Lisa :( I'm sorry.
@TX_Lisa I'm sorry that's an argument worthy topic.
@OhDianeMarie Definitely! &lt;3
@OhDianeMarie But it's worth thinking about. :)
@OhDianeMarie Aw, that would be heavenly. We should talk more seriously about that. Even with the baby free might be too much $$.
@TX_Lisa I didn't either. Then I had kids, and I looked hard at my life, and didn't like what I was modeling. And my priorities changed.
@OhDianeMarie Not "1 day 17 hours" or whatever silly business from Google Maps. Bah.
@OhDianeMarie I mean, clearly planes go there, but driving was my comfort zone. We are really good at 8 hrs now.
@OhDianeMarie Annnd Google maps laughed at me when I looked up the drive.
@OhDianeMarie Awwww, seriously, today I was thinking, "it's summer soon! I can go to the other coast with the girls, right??"
@TX_Lisa No, my 1st goal is NOT a successful marriage. My first goal is happy, healthy children, then a happy, healthy life, THEN marriage.
@OhDianeMarie *raises hand*
@TX_Lisa Getting him into the program he just started really was the last straw. I tried *everything* to change myself first.
@TX_Lisa It's been a very, very long road, through many years of therapy, to get brave enough to ask for this much.
@TX_Lisa And I bristle at that, bc that's what we always say to women struggling for more respect. Are you *sure* you deserve it?
@TX_Lisa You have made several comments that sound a lot like "are you REALLY sure you have examined YOURSELF enough?"
@TX_Lisa I'm going to just be blunt at this point. This conversation bugs me because you seem to be implying I'm asking for too much.
@TX_Lisa That's a reasonable request. Why the comment about me going to therapy?
@TX_Lisa I genuinely don't understand.
@TX_Lisa At least in this context. We're talking about a marriage where my husband is currently in treatment for emotional abuse.
@TX_Lisa ok, I agree that the idea of earning good treatment is silly, but honestly I don't know what else you would mean by "earn respect"
@TX_Lisa of the doubt, always taking his opinions at face value and assuming he meant what he said. He still doesn't respect me. Ten years.
@TX_Lisa Listen. I spent years trying to "earn" different behavior by treating him how I wanted to be treated, by giving him the benefit
@TX_Lisa And him caring what I think of him doesn't mean we can't have fights or disagreements or differences of opinion.
@TX_Lisa I want him to care about me  having a good opinion of him. I'm not talking about having my taste in movies.
@toomuchaubrey @Vims8 I appreciate the support. So much.
@TX_Lisa It is very true that I don't get to pick his feelings. I really don't want to dictate to him how to feel, honestly.
@toomuchaubrey @Vims8 Exactly this. I am slowly working through the long list of everything. Just about out of list! Which is ok.
@peacefultaru HUGS. I know sometimes we just need an alone space to cry.
@TX_Lisa How so?
@Vims8 Oh, sometimes it sucks. But I learn more everyday. I know so much now.
@Vims8 He started a group program for emotional abuse  a few weeks ago, bc I said otherwise I'd divorce him. &amp; knows I will if he quits.
@Vims8 Mostly, two small children who think he's the bees knees. Plus ten years of my life. Plus economic dependence.
And it's not ok to react to me thinking he's a slimeball by just arguing me into silence.
Well, that's great for strangers, but I'm his goddamned wife. He can't be ok with me thinking he's a slimeball &amp; still declare he loves me.
Which crystallizes *so* much. He prides himself on his independence and his aloofness from other people's opinions.
I want him to care what I think of him!
He really doesn't understand that you can disagree with someone and yet still care what they think of you.
And I didn't really get how to articulate that until I said it to him. *He* still doesn't get it, but more &amp; more *I* get it.
Because, if he respects me, respects my outlook on the world, how I approach it - if he does that, then offending me would make him sad.
So I try to explain to my husband that I want him to care when I say what he has said is offensive, not bc I want him to agree with me, but
But this isn't that. It's more like "it's not real until you're willing to say it to their face, even if they don't get it."
Which I have mixed feelings about. I never believed in "talking to hear yourself talk."
More and more I find myself in the situation where I realize I'm talking for my own benefit, not the other person's.
@ashleighlynne :( :(
@BirdOfTaradise Yeah. And they don't even realize how condescending that is.
@BirdOfTaradise Family is the worst for stuff like that. You know your kid.
@Layogenic &lt;3 Thank you.
Which I suppose is a great survival trait - run from the bear, THEN freak out - but it's hard when you're trying to NEVER freak out.
I am so terrible for post crisis anxiety.
Look at me, pushing the men in my life in all sorts of ways. Hooray. Just gotta calm down now. Blegh.
Update: husband got home and was ok about it. So that's good. My dad (the giver of the lamp originally) even apologized.
Even now I second guess myself all the time. Bc for him, the icy cold judgment is just life. He sees the world that way.
@yesthataimee Thank you.
This is what I've been grappling with, since I've been home. Even if he changes completely, how do I ever, ever feel comfortable?
And even if he doesn't, even if he plays nice? I'll just still feel like it was a near miss. Still has me anxious, despite myself.
I'm mostly being like this because if the scare earlier, bc I'm expecting my husband to flip on me when I tel him. And that sucks.
Actually being in my sister's house, where I was constantly afraid of them breaking stuff, felt better.
I don't want to be here. I don't want to be in this house.
Need some self-compassion today. Don't have it. Struggling.
@_L1vY_ I agree. Your clients will likely be paying more and also likely to be in weekly (instead of every 4-6 wks). It doesn't make sense.
@_L1vY_ I don't know, never having leased for a business, but I absolutely agree with you that I doubt men get asked if their wives work!
@_L1vY_ :( on asking if you are married/supported by husband. :( :(
@rtgarden Yeah, self editing without being excessively self focused.  :)
@rtgarden Thanks. I know it will always be complicated.
@rtgarden Yes, absolutely this. But it's so alien to figure out how to value myself as a person as opposed to just labor.
Anyway. I just - I know what I need to do. I just don't know how to find the time/strength/support to do it.
Well, guess what, I always affect other people. Especially now that I have kids. Every choice I make affects them, all the time.
Not if it affects other people, anyway. My family's always been fine if I do whatever, as long as it affects no one else ever.
Which is both "well, ok, that seems perfectly reasonable" and also really scary. Bc we don't reward living by your own values.
So I'm starting to think I need to decide what I value and then judge my behavior against those values.
That's no basis for actually feeling good about myself, just a way of defending against others attacks.
I don't think just saying "hey, I have depression, I need to ease up on myself" is the whole picture. That's just focusing on deficiency.
How do you judge how well you're doing? How do you feel good about what you get done in a day?
So I struggle and I struggle. When all your interactions are with people who don't see you, who use you up and don't respect you, +
Also the tendency of many white women to essentially be trying to do the flip from runner up to first in line. Which is gross.
There is so much that is "you're awesome!" based on no actual information about a person. Which is no better than baseless criticism.
So there's a *lot* out there to counteract the "everyone else must be first" stuff, but a lot of it rubs me the wrong way.
Which is, well, pretty darn normal for women.
So I struggle constantly w a feeling of worthlessness, &amp; the idea that my needs/wishes/desires must always come second to everyone else's.
@randomjeweler Oh, that makes sense! I feel silly. Thank you.
@randomjeweler Sorry, that was maybe abrupt. I def do not hold individual UUs (who are generally awesome) responsible for org as a whole.
@randomjeweler Not your fault!!
@randomjeweler Yeah. I just had such a bad experience at the last place. :/ plus husband is a pain about it.
Talking myself and husband into taking the kids to a UU church for RE and sex ed now.
@AliceDreger I am so sorry for that. And I'm so happy you got to go there to back up his perceptions.
@AliceDreger I love your kid right now.
Anyway. If you ever feel bad saying no to or throwing away something with a button battery in it, just come talk to me. I'll back you up.
@_L1vY_ Thank you. Thank goodness they're both ok.
@_L1vY_ I know we can't keep them perfectly safe ever. I just knew better, but I let it go because everyone acted like I was being silly.
@_L1vY_ Thank you. I'm frustrated because I didn't trust myself originally. I didn't trust myself. I'm so tired of that.
I can't talk to anyone bc I'm too ashamed. It's my fault for not saying no.
I feel so stupid for letting that thing in my house, and then again, for not throwing it away as soon as possible.
I'm having terrified thoughts that there was another battery, even though as far as I can tell there was space for only one.
(TW: child death) If the toddler had swallowed that battery, as far as I can tell, she would have been dead before I knew what happened.
I'm still vaguely panicking, even after a string of texts to my parents that I probably shouldn't have sent and the lamp in the trash.
Until this morning, when I found the remote open. I was terrified until I found the battery still inside.
Now she's using something else. And it ended up in the guest room/baby's room at some point, and has been there. Kids ignored it.
Especially since she'd already seen it, you know? So we let her use it for a while, and let the batteries run down, and
I noted that the remote had a disk battery in it at the time, and was uncomfortable with it, but I felt rude/crazy refusing that she use it.
My parents gave the 4 yo a camping lamp with a remote control months ago, as a night light.
I wish I had a nonjudgmental mom friend to call right now about this scare I just had.
@marydell Well, codependency groups are full of compulsive helpers, supposedly, so hopefully they help? I dunno yet.
@marydell Ah! Ok. :) What do you usually use? I hate all the third party apps.
@SewSoDef :(
@marydell FWIW it's gotten a bit better on repeat visits. I'm still a bit on the fence about mixed gender codependency groups.
@SewSoDef Did anyone join?
@marydell Genuinely curious how you found this tweet? It's fairly old?
@TexasBobbi even if she still doesn't "get it," there's a measurable benefit there.
@TexasBobbi That's why I thought of the donation gig. If she actually lives off much less for a week or a month, and donates the diff,
@TexasBobbi I think it's the idea that it's "poverty tourism," that she's not really learning anything. That she's too disconnected.
@TexasBobbi I haven't! My comment was based on people being annoyed with Gwyneth Paltrow for writing about it.
Come up with some cutesy name for it, pick a calendar month, and run it annually.
Encourage a whole lot of people to feed themselves on the amount they'd get from aid for a month, and donate the cash difference.
I'm probably missing something, but that actually seems like a reasonable fundraiser for a food pantry.
I would be more impressed w people living on "food stamps" if they donated the difference btw that &amp; what they would have spent.
@catinahelmet I really want a comic book about Nonbinary Grandpa now.
I dislike any mention of #EqualPayDay that doesn't include a discussion of race. It's such a huge factor.
This must be a cold, not allergies. I've lost my voice and I'm so tired I keep sitting down and having trouble moving again.
Which is not to say success itself is bad, but the ones that measure themselves based on how well they Succeed... Nope.
@ZippyKittyToo :D
I'm coming to accept that it is ok for me to come to dislike someone the more I realize she's invested in succeeding in that institution.
This is one middle class college educated white lady that wants to burn the whole institution of Middle Class Educated White Ladies down.

@eastsidekate Can I choose option c: both a &amp; b ?
@Kishmishiani Yay! Good for you.
You will probably see similar tweets next Tuesday, too. LOL.
These Tues tweets brought to you by the fact that I am currently attending a Codependency Anonymous group on Mondays.
A Band of Wives (I guess they're A Band of Women now...) feels similar to Lean In in that it's for the 1% of women.
I guess Lean In Lady has her own version of groups, but those are only for climbing the ladder corporate types.
@_L1vY_ But yeah, pretty much. Want to bring back that.
@_L1vY_ Well, and since the original concept was pretty solidly second wave, yeah? We'd have to update that.
That seems like such a dated concept, but that's what I want. To see people face to face in a feminist space.
I really want a weekly intersectional feminist group to attend.
@UnseenPerfidy I've heard of other people who have seasonal shifts that aren't the stereotypical SAD. Don't remember a specific name for it.
I am honestly angry that his book is circulating. Because I think he is actively skewing the discourse the wrong direction.
Ok, good for you? But saying "I cut it bc other ppl thought it was offensive" is not "I now get why it was offensive, I learned!"
LRTs cue @/jonronson expecting a pat on the back for having cut it, and "listening to other people who thought it was offensive."
Including his apparent inability to process his own experience with any insight.

@nevernotdoing @kingdomofwench I guess if you have to be up early, might as well laugh about poop! :P
Bah. Phone about to die and I need to go to sleep anyway. But I love y'all. Just want you to know that. &lt;3 &lt;3
@runningnekkid Will you be my mom?
@kingdomofwench @nevernotdoing This is so awesome. I want my kids to poop in someone else's tub. Yes.
@kingdomofwench @nevernotdoing Nice! Yeah, if you have two adults, that helps. I struggle when it's just me, two wet dirty kids, &amp; tub poop!
@kingdomofwench @nevernotdoing Nothing makes grown ups flail like babies and poop. I STILL flail when toddler poops in the tub. **sigh**
@kingdomofwench @nevernotdoing Oh no! If everyone is sick that is not funny. Just a super mess when you feel bad.
Again I notice that my favorite peeps stay up later than I usually do. **waves to the cool peeps**
@kingdomofwench @nevernotdoing This is just how it is. I still remember how my oldest got the wall once. It was so far! I just laughed.
@nevernotdoing Oh my gosh! Yeah, girls just make a puddle. :P
@nevernotdoing I was pretty surprised how much oomph he had behind the pee at 2 weeks old! My sister even warned me.
@nevernotdoing That's awesome. I don't remember if my kids have ever anointed my sister, but they must have.
@nevernotdoing Exactly. :)
Seriously, I was telling him he was running out of chances to get me, and he got me like right after that. Good on him.
Anyway, got to hold the nephew for a few hours, fees him, &amp; also change him. He peed on me. Which I feel he needed to do while I was here.
Which is reassuring, I guess? I dunno.
Sooo just chatted with BIL for like two hours, including a convo about police murders where I didn't get annoyed with him.
@_L1vY_ At times it's really set me up for being a victim. And so much of learning to function better has been embracing my reactions.
@_L1vY_ I have to think more on this. I haven't ever thought of it before as "don't react," but that's really what I do.
@_L1vY_ Yeah, the "don't react" is what gets me.
Except for my own kids. They're my job, and I can be honest with them, and keep my relationship straight with them.
It is not my job to fix this system or even get them all to see it for what it is. They're grown ups. Grooooowwwn ups.
Even snapping at my kids is recoverable. I'm not a bad person - I'm in a tricky emotional bind. I apologized, calmed myself down.
@_L1vY_ I don't feel like a confidante - but I see what you're saying. They certainly like to talk to me until I'm ready to lose it.
...side with my sister in the eye rolling at my mom. It's to check out of the game and decide what *I* want. And recognize I'm not crazy.
And the way out of that is not to play I to that. Is not to yell at them, or call my mom on her contradictions, or
The truth is that, as @_L1vY_ pointed out, this is all part of the dynamic. I'm the crazy one, the one with the big feelings.
@_L1vY_ Yeah. I have thought this before. Thanks for saying this.
Coda, though: I come downstairs and my mom and BIL sound like they are discussing Walter Scott. NOT a convo I can handle w these ppl rn.
Sigh. I don't know. Tweeting it out just makes me feel less crazy. I don't have a conclusion.
Meanwhile, I just want to scream at all of THEM, the adults, but what to say??
Made her shut down and gave her flashbacks to her own alcoholic mother. And she was proud that she had that much insight.
Which, last time I was here, my mom shared w me that me snapping at my kids (which I don't do much of, but have been doing a lot more here)
Meanwhile, I'm speechless, I go upstairs to bathe my kids, and I snap at them bc I feel so trapped.
And everyone in this system would claim to feel love - if perhaps mixed with confusion or exasperation. But love.
This in a supposedly loving family.
My sister heard all this and rolled her eyes to me. She just writes my mom off. She basically called her senile earlier.
I went from cautiously happy, to stricken. Bc I don't know which to react to - her words or her tone. I'm stuck.
Listening between the lines, the union failed my mom and told her a bunch of stuff to make her go away, and she just absorbed it.
"A whole group of other ppl went from 9 to 10." "I have the lowest grade in the whole plant." "I'm maxed out on raises - never more money."
She said about a half dozen things which the text of which would sound really bitter - but in a really "eh, NBD" chipper voice.
According to her, union tried to negotiate her up from grade 9 to 12, but mgmt threatened to cut her position, so instead she got 3%.
She has a union job, they renegotiated everybody because of a new contract, and she got a 3% raise.
(Sorry, my numbers are out if whack. I'm rly upset, trying to tweet, and my kids are causing trouble, too.)
I can't imitate the flow of this conversation, but just imagine every question I ask has a negative answer, but said in a chipper voice. 3/
"I got a raise!" She says it in a happy voice. My sister and I both say congratulations. I start asking for more details. 5/
She offered to bring dinner to my sister's house. I walked in with her, we got the food all settled, and she says: 3/
I used to think of her as so competent, so organized, so smart. So put together. An accountant. 3/
First, you need to imagine my mom. She is a middle aged overweight white woman. 2/
Ok. I need to talk about this conversation I just had with my mom. 1/
@tauriqmoosa The fact that I watched IV-VI over and over as a kid makes gender representation even *more* important, imo.
@kingdomofwench I endorse this self- talk. Yes indeedy. Bonus points for using that actual wording.
@OhDianeMarie Hugs for feeling better. :)

READ: Suffocation is a kink ... 
@mylifeasprose I hope all is well with you. &lt;3
@mylifeasprose Hanging in there. I'm planning to be here until Sunday. Doing my best to handle it well, not sure how I'm doing. ;)
My sister loved Empire Records. However, she just doesn't seem like she'll appreciate that it's the 20th anniversary of THE Rex Manning Day.
@addyeB I'm happy for you!
And my sister watched part of it with us, and of course had nothing good to say. :P
In somewhat related news, I rented The Book of Life at the request of my preschooler, and I thought it was very sweet and cute.
@jenrenpody @story3girl I'm glad other people are flabbergasted, too, and it's not just me. &lt;3
Maybe I need to go donate to some things in her name. Petty, but it would make me feel better. :P ~fin~ 19/19
@story3girl &lt;3 &lt;3
@story3girl Yeah. Thanks for listening. &lt;3
@story3girl You're right, you're right. But this is my only sister, and I do feel more obligation to her and her kid than I do a stranger.
@story3girl Right??? I was really struggling to imagine this. I can't. Not like she said it. I mean, I compared the ears!!
@story3girl I know, I know. But they act like *I'm* the disgusting one, which throws me off balance.
Anyway, I'm heartbroken, and frustrated, and I feel sad. Bc my parents raised us fairly tolerantly - standard white liberal UU stuff. 18/
This is pretty darn blatant, knowing her, but also not overt enough that I can think of how to address it in any direct way.
I'm used to my sister expressing judgment of me/others in rly covert terms. I'm used to her thinking poorly of me &amp; playing it "nice." 16/
Basically whenever I mention movie/show w black people both her &amp; my BIL give me this specific look of shock &amp; disgust. 15/
"Political" message into a film like that. Again, I was floored. 14/
Her comment when I mentioned wanting to see the new Annie was that she didn't think it was appropriate to put that kind of 13/
I add that to the collection of disgusted looks I've gotten from her when I've mentioned media with black people... 12/
I have never heard anyone talk about Obama that way to me personally. I mean, she was disgusted. 11/
I mean, she is a fucking PA. Health care providers tend to at least concede ACA is trying to solve a difficult problem. 10/
I knew her in-laws were Middle America "libertarian" Methodist white people, but I guess I had kind of hopes my sister wasn't as bad. 9/
So... apparently you can? 8/
I tried to recover by saying, "I really wasn't trying to start anything political, you can't deny he's successful." ...silence... 7/
In the most dismissive voice, "I really hope he (the baby) can do better than that." 6/
My sister was Appalled. At my look of surprise (I really was trying to be positive!) she said they weren't a fan of Obama and 5/
I meant to make the mildest of reassuring jokes by saying, "Well, Obama's ears are wonky, and it hasn't held him back." 4/
He's 10 days old. His ears are a little wonky. It happens. 3/
So I'm sitting with my sister and BIL and the baby in front of the TV one or two nights ago, and we end up discussing the baby's ears. 2/
Storytime. Content note: racism. 1/
Anyway. I can leave any time. I can leave any time. I can leave I can leave I can leave.
Bc I think my sister learned, like me, to hide those. Even from herself, at times. It is so exhausting.
I will be watching for cues that it's not really fine, and not see them, but I don't trust that.
... even though she will tell me, point blank, to my face, "It's fine."
One thing that really stresses me out is the idea that I have to somehow know when my sister wants me to go...
Being here is a mixed experience, and I can stay as long as it's more good than bad. Or as long as I want to, or I'm asked to go.
I just need to remember I can go gone whenever I want. I have a car. I'm not stuck.
@story3girl Thank you, hon. &lt;3
@stuckinspincycl Visiting my sister who has a newborn with my 4 yo and 20 mo makes me feel happier with the idea of just two.
My efforts to get the kids tired by taking them for a loooong walk has just turned my kids into Tasmanian Devils???
@runningnekkid Yes! We are dying eggs right now. 
Ok. Texted BIL for help instead of my sister. He was happy to help. I can be part of the solution and lean on him instead of her sometimes!
Uggggggh. I was trying to be all stealthy and leave to go to my mom's without pestering my sister, and I locked us out w/o kiddo's carseat.
@nevernotdoing This is a good idea!!
@nevernotdoing eh. I'm speaking as somebody who feel like I turn into more of an uber feminist every day.
And I'm here to try to help, but I'm only here for a week, so I get why she wouldn't want to rely on me.
.@nevernotdoing My BIL is an average guy. That's the thing. He means well. This is just how life is when you're not an uber feminist.
@nevernotdoing I hear you. I so hear you.
@nevernotdoing It absolutely breaks my heart. My sister is the breadwinner and cleans and cooks and now is taking the lead on baby.
That she just needs to baby her husband more, let him do it his "own way," whatever claptrap we tend to say about "involving" husbands.
My heart just breaks at my sister, who is so extremely competent, hearing and internalizing the advice that the problem is her.
Except that is exactly the message I feel like I get in a thousand ways, constantly. I can do whatever I want, but no one will back me up.
We have leaders &amp; followers in all areas of life. We hope the experts in anything are leading. That doesn't mean the experts get no help.
@allthepie This is all below the level of conscious decision making or ideology. They just don't know how to do it.
@allthepie I think it's a pretty unconscious thing trained into them of my knowing how to play follower at home. Lead or throw hands up.
- and my sister repeating that advice, which I know I heard "you can't expect him to do it the way you would do it." Which, ok, maybe?
This brought to you by talking to my sister, whose husband sleeps through the baby crying, who says to wake him up -
But in my experience, men only have two options in any activity: hands off helplessness, or debate like their input is valuable.
I get that I'm addressing a complicated thing, that every relationship is different, &amp; no one can do anything exactly the way another would.
Why can't husbands just take care of the baby the way their wives ask them to? Why is it so impossible to take direction?
With my parents gone, my sister and I are doing much better. So that's awesome.
@rtgarden Yeah. Now that my parents left, both my sister and I seem calmer. So that helps, too. Thanks. &lt;3
@rtgarden Well, 4 yo asked to stay the night with grandma, and I let her. Hopefully that helps?
BUT everyone in my family would dismiss the idea that anything related to patriarchy is going on.
My mom and sister both move constantly. Constantly. Kids, food, dishes. My BIL does a lot, but he doesn't move constantly.
My dad gets away with being completely checked out emotionally and swooping in with platitudes bc he's a man.
My family could use a lot more feminism.
@rtgarden TBH, what I need is some time where I'm allowed to talk about *me,* and I will never ask for that.
@rtgarden Yeah. It's just hard to say that I can't handle being around my family. Brings up old stuff about being the crazy one.
@OhDianeMarie HUGS
@rtgarden Maybe. I don't know. The plan was to be here a week and I am a mess after one day. I feel like I need a plan.
@rtgarden I'm hoping to feel calmer once I get the toddler in bed, yeah, and then maybe something brilliant will occur to me.
@rtgarden I just don't know what to do. I mean, just drive home? They'll treat me like I'm being overdramatic.
@rtgarden Well, I think this is really it. It's making me act out! Which has to be really hard on her.
@rtgarden She has never been like this about her little sister?
@rtgarden I feel really embarrassed of bringing my kids to just cause trouble.
@rtgarden They're all paying her plenty of attention, really. And I'm mortified.
She's 4. If she's misbehaving, I'm in charge of making that better. And I think that means leaving.
She is so little, and all she is getting is mom is "mean" because I have zero patience and I'm embarrassed of her.
You know what matters more than any of them? My kid. Because she is my responsibility (unlike my sister's kid).
I guess I just need to admit that's not happening. I should just admit I am miserable and ashamed and give up.
I could go to my parents' house - that wasn't as miserable as this. But I genuinely wanted to be helpful.
I cannot remember the last time I was this angry at the 4 yo. Genuine desperate rage. Bc I feel so squeezed. I don't know what to do.
I am in full on shame spiral mode that my sister's the one with a new baby and all I have done is add to their chaos with my kids.
I kept taking her out of the room but as soon as I brought her back, she screamed about something new.
The 4 yo screamed constantly at dinner and I wished I could just get her out of the situation, but go where?
@mylifeasprose Yeah. It gets extra bad in times of stress, you know, when that's the least helpful.
No one will ever just tell me the truth. "You're fucking up." No one will ever. I'm just supposed to know.
Anger or even frustration is never, ever ok. Direct expression of "I didn't like that you did that," not ok.
It's the end of the world to talk about feelings, unless they're the "right" ones.
I always feel slightly on edge with my family. I constantly feel like I need to blurt out something "wrong."
My sister has been given *lots* of food since she had the baby. Including 2 pans of brownies? I approve &amp; I'm a little jealous.
@runningnekkid Right? :( :(
So I knew my sister's in-laws were conservative, but I didn't realize they were Glenn Beck conservative. :(
@story3girl Thank you. I hope the Easter egg hunt goes well!
@story3girl Kids are much easier to appreciate when they're someone else's. We got in at 12, both partied until 2! Now little is up at 7. :P
@story3girl Haha. Our 4 yos seem to have some very similar thinking. :P
@story3girl Aww. It was so nice to meet your family! &lt;3
@LouisatheLast If you're ever down in Philadelphia, and want to get a bite or coffee, let me know. I'll leave them at home. :)
@LouisatheLast It was really nice to meet you. Thanks for humoring my kids.
@LouisatheLast We just parked in the garage on Fraser. So not there yet. :)
@LouisatheLast I am leaving now, so should show up in town by around noon. :)
@rabcyr This is the argument I have had with my husband multiple times. I hear you. But, seriously, you don't have to hang with them?
I can have compassion for his feelings, while recognizing that they are at least partially caused by really problematic thinking. 7/7
But maybe it's a problem of "identifying" too much - which may be more about buying into his thinking than about the feelings. 5/
I had really started to think maybe I had too much empathy for my husband, and needed to figure out how to have less? 4/
They said this is distinct from "empathy" - a difference I'm not sure I completely get yet. 3/
One thing new to me was the idea of "identification" with the abuser as a defense mechanism, one which may have costs.
Read a bit more in this forgiveness workbook for recovering from spousal abuse. 1/
Sooooo supposedly supporters of that anti-gay pizza place which is closed, have raised 50k for them. I seriously dislike America right now.
@LetToysBeToys Which was what I thought when I saw these recently. :( 
@LetToysBeToys I can't understand why they don't just combine them. :(
This kid. I have no idea what is going on. Up at 4, won't sleep to save her life, now, passed out in my lap. Can I get her to bed? Unlikely.
@LouisatheLast I definitely will. Once we get on the road I'll have a good idea what time, too. :)
@LouisatheLast Cool! If we get up eRly enough, we will make the detour through State College. :)
@LouisatheLast This reminds me, we are getting back on the road tomorrow as early as I can stand it. Can we stop by?
@jasonpgignac Thank you.
She got herself so worked up it took her a while to calm down even once I got her. So apparently 4 am is when she wakes up now...
Note, that's awake since 4, including an hour of *trying* to sleep while trying to let toddler cry herself back to sleep. Did not work.
7am is not nearly so friendly when I've been awake since 4.
@LouisatheLast I hear you. Very good point.
@LouisatheLast Even the actors we love play bad guys sometimes?
@LouisatheLast I would be so much more motivated to watch a history of the Reformation with Idris Elba.
@drgrist I have liked it so far, even though I don't generally like zombies or "murder of the week" shows. I like the characters.
... um, could care less about women in tech, &amp; are just using little girls learning to code as a shield to avoid actual accountability. 8/8
And you are just waiting for the "WHY do you hate on little girls coding camps???" Then that's kind of a sign that the ppl saying that 7/
I just think that should be a red flag. If you know saying "hey, I think the most important thing is to fix harassment and retention!" 6/
Where they have to say, "sure, scholarships are great!" because they're afraid of sounding like they kick puppies or something. 5/
Maybe I'm just cranky and cynical today, but I am leaning more and more away from being comfortable with the dance I see writers doing, 4/
"Pipeline" crap let's us subtly reinforce stereotypes about how women just aren't "into" things, by pretending that's the problem. 3/
It's willfully focusing on the problem in a way that the ppl in charge can deflect the most responsibility onto the women themselves. 2/
The more I think about it, the more I think focusing on "pipeline" issues for women in tech is not just misguided or "not enough," 1/
@Kishmishiani Sending all the hugs.
@danileekelley I'm seriously happy you got one. &lt;3 Hope it works out well.
It has all the things I hate! Zombies! Murder of the week! Creepy sociopaths that remind me of my BIL! I should hate this show.
I am so disturbed that the only show I have watched in a reasonably timely fashion (like the day after, on Hulu) in YEARS is iZombie.
The irony for me is my sister makes significantly more money than him. It's not like he's some high powered breadwinner.
My BIL took all of two whole days off last week for the birth of his son. And my sister is really struggling this week.
LRT: Optimism has costs.
Oh, another one was "identification" - seeing things through the abuser's frame. I have done that a lot. So much.
All of these make perfect sense for me to avoid dealing with the reality that he is this awful. Bc I can't leave easily at all.
I was reading about defense mechanisms with abuse yesterday - denial, suppression, disassociation, etc.
He talked multiple times about how he can't "express himself" in our relationship without me getting mad at him, and how rough that was.
"Hates that he makes me feel so terrible." All sounds like he "cares" - but still focused on **him.**
That's the thing that is flooring me right now. Multiple conversations about how he "gives up" and how he is "trying," and how he +
I need him to just not talk to me. Every sentence is focused on him and how hard he is trying and his feelings.
Apparently the fun wasn't over. A day and a half of my husband's crap.
Last night was rough.
Now my stomach is all in knots.
@BartoszScheller I hope all of you get lots of love and support.
@BartoszScheller I'm do sorry you lost your cat. Sending you kind thoughts. And I'm sorry you're dad is making it harder.
Who knows? Maybe he'd have picked this fight anyway. It doesn't help to analyze that if he refuses to discuss his behavior with any honesty.
He's off to his first group session now. Yes, picking a fight beforehand seems related to me.
@TexasBobbi Yeah.
Ending with the "You insist on thinking poorly of me! Look, I'm giving up!!" And when I say that seemed like more manipulation, denying it.
@TexasBobbi He likes being around the kids. The problem is he feels entitled to decide when I'm allowed to leave bc of it.

Instead: "I want you to leave on Monday. How about Sunday? How about midday Saturday? I want to see the kids. +
Doing what I want would have been, when I said yesterday "I'm planning to leave on Friday": saying "ok," and then dropping it.

Had really lovely visits with two different moms today. Then came home to a husband who was angry and pulling gaslighty crap. :(
@rtgarden This is true. I try to tell her the truth as much as I can. Hopefully that helps her keep her internal compass.
@rtgarden Truly, though, I'd rather not have manipulation and abuse be something she learns. But I guess a lot of that is out of my control.
@rtgarden My dad always joked "insanity is hereditary, you catch it from your kids."
@rtgarden the other person show emotion, bc that's "weak." I admit I hope my daughter doesn't absorb that value...
@rtgarden I have a joke now with a friend that my husband is French, bc of the tendency to see conversation as a war where winning is making
@rtgarden haha. There is definitely a cultural difference in terms of the verbal sparring, yes?
@rtgarden I will look. It might be hard to find something for quite this age - though I think she's advanced very quickly recently.
@rtgarden I will. :)
@rtgarden There are probably some creative apps out there if I look. :)
@rtgarden Agreed. So much is about just finding a good personality fit.
@rtgarden Yes. I had thought about looking into a Suzuki type lesson for her - I need to look again.
@rtgarden - my husband lives through the "you will play piano whether you like it or not" sort of thing, and I'd rather not do that!
@rtgarden This is a good point. We aren't musical, really. I would like to expose her to it in a fun way -
@rtgarden This sounds like such a nice skill to have. :)
It appears to have some research behind it - which is no guarantee of infallibility, but is a nice marker for some effort being put into it.
There's a distinction drawn between "forgiveness" (internal to victim) and "reconciliation" (2 person process).
- doesn't necessarily include contact with the offender.
- it actually seems really promising so far. They start right off with trying to point out forgiveness is voluntary, in your own time, and -
Another topic: I found this workbook on forgiveness as a method for healing from abuse - and despite my raised eyebrows at "forgiveness" -
Just thinking about how, the less I act like an appendage with him, the more I move into being the Enemy.
(Note that, throughout our relationship, loving me "just the way *I* am" has not been on the table. Because I am Crazy.)
- who will love him just the way he is (read: not call him on any of his crap).
My husband has talked about the romantic notions he has about how he doesn't care about what everybody thinks, he just wants "one woman" -
I think "romantic" notions are just as, if not more, damaging in the minds of men.
You know, I hear a LOT of talk about the messages we send to girls in media. What about the messages we send to men?
I spaced out of X-Files later on, so when I found out recently that they had Mulder and Scully shack up I was sad. Not mad - just sad.
This also makes me extra annoyed at shows that just cannot help pairing up opposite sex partners romantically.
(I am annoyed at myself for saying "bad guys" without thinking about it.)
@sassycrass Maybe second act seafood......
Bond has plenty of "strong" female characters - but they all are either bad guys and get killed, or they get seduced.
I think we train men to think of women either as appendages or the enemy. Not partners.
@rtgarden So much! Talked w a friend today abt when she visits her inlaws in France &amp; getting headaches from the effort of speaking French.
@rtgarden Aw, neat. That's nice to know.
@sassycrass :(
@libraryyeti @peacefultaru EXTRA CAPS HUGS
@libraryyeti @peacefultaru Is it okay to butt in to this caps party with some HUGS?
@stuckinspincycl Yes! Boooo. I miss decongestants so much sometimes (not good when nursing).
@stuckinspincycl HUGS. Pregnancy is hard work. And they won't let you have the stuff that you normally use to survive hard work. Booooo.
@rtgarden How early was your exposure? How long? We'll likely move in 2 more years - may not be able to keep it up.
@ashleighlynne She's learning French in preschool. Not from me! :)
@rtgarden I'm just amazed how she already has a great accent. I try to mimic what she says and it's hard. :)
@rtgarden I'm excited about it. I want to fill it up and keep it for her for when she's older. :)
@rtgarden I do sometimes &amp; sometimes her answers are interesting. She's learning in context so sometimes she doesn't know how to explain. :)
@rtgarden We've been doing science stuff lately - I bought a notebook today we're going to use as a lab notebook to record what we're doing.
@rtgarden She's learning so much right now - she writes her name now. I was writing words for her earlier and she was copying them.
@rtgarden She's in a French immersion preschool 5 days a week. It's pretty cool.
I was happy I knew what she meant that time. Sometimes now I have no idea. Awesome, but a little unnerving.
4 yo talks to me in French now. Brought something to me in the grocery and said "qu'est-ce que c'est?" (What is it?)
@OhDianeMarie Yes! My 4 yo is 95% kick butt awesome, and 5% sheer screaming. Totally worth the screaming, tho.
@OhDianeMarie Because... Four. &lt;3 &lt;3
Great piece by @andreagrimes for men who don't want the women in their lives to be threatened for having opinions: 
Spending all day in the car with two little kids means at the day I am exhausted and they are bouncing off walls. nooooo
And I just need to figure out how to survive interacting her without losing my equilibrium, bc I want to be around my sister.
I told her what was frustrating me, bc I needed to say the truth and not pretend everything was fine. Not to get her to do anything.
And the truth is, she doesn't owe me diddly. I'm a grown up. She maybe owed me something when I was small - but what's done is done.
The truth is, I just don't think she's going to see somebody. It's too hard. If she does, fine. But not gonna hold my breath.
And I know she means it - sort of. She said the same thing the last time this came up - a year and a half ago.
So I just tried to talk to her, and she listened and talked about how she needs to "talk to somebody about it."
I'm so mad at my mom and I don't think she's even capable of understanding why.
So I get to play the role of Crazy for saying "I'm overwhelmed." I get to be the broken one, bc I'm honest instead of hiding it.
I don't really think I'm that much crazier than the rest of them. But I certainly can't bear to dance around the elephant in the room.
And that's my role in my birth family - the Crazy One. The one who was always having feelings that were out of proportion.
So she is like Leave it to Beaver chipper while I get more and more overwhelmed - which just makes me feel ashamed and crazy.
- and she shows absolutely zero recognition that I'm struggling. It's not that I'm not getting help - it's the being **invisible.**
Or she can just listen to me get more and more overwhelmed with a cranky toddler, and I'm being explicit that I'm overwhelmed -
So she can do things like say really cruel things in a chipper tone of voice, and declare there's nothing wrong.
She has no idea what is going on inside her own head, or what she's actually feeling.
And it is finally sinking in to me that my mom really has almost *zero* self insight. Bc she is starting to say so.
Today the combo of an overtired and cranky toddler and whatever the hell my mother is made me lose it for the first time this trip.
@StaceyLRicks I told her it made me uncomfortable, and we talked about it, which helped. &lt;3
Today got better. My sister seems a little more comfortable with nursing. I'm doing ok at just being around and being reassuring.
@SpaceAgNicole This seems like a perfectly reasonable thing for a kid to think!
@SpaceAgNicole Oh, wow, I didn't even think of that. But I see it now.
Seriously. I'm amazed no real country has put spiders on their flags to be intimidating.
For ex, 4 yo drew a spider, waved the paper, &amp; called it a flag. So we got to have a laugh about that being the scariest flag in the world.
Today was confusing and emotionally exhausting, but there was some good silliness.
I get it. People don't tell the truth. See plot of every movie and sitcom ever. Which is why I can't figure out how to operate in the world.
Oh yeah, bc I crave honesty and being above board from everyone, especially my family. UGH.
Why am I talking to you about relatively subtle issues of control and manipulation?
I mean, if y'all can't even talk in a grown up way about my BIL making one night of bad decisions w alcohol, and my sister being mad at him,
And makes me feel dumb for telling them about my husband going into this program.
"Don't tell her I told you," either explicitly or implicitly. Which just sucks.
One more thing. Being home makes it weird bc my mom keeps telling me things that my sister specifically did not tell me, and then says
I kind of just want to space out and read something mindless for a bit, but that's not an option w the kiddos.
Which is why I'm talking to Twitter. Lol.
And it's going to be hard and not perfect no matter what, and I need to do my best to not burden *her* if I'm freaking out.
My sister doesn't have that problem. I know the best I can do is try to listen to what she wants from me, and do it.
For me, my first baby was the first thing in a long time where I could just dig deep, take the lead, and insist on my way.
I keep trying to think to when I had my first baby, and what helped and what didn't - but my sister's situation is so different.
My sister and parents say they're glad I'm here, that I'm helping - but I also bring my two kids, who are little bundles of chaos.
I feel adrift, and confused , and very tired right now.
@VelveteenMama Thanks. :) It's new to be the aunt and not the mom.
@VelveteenMama Hugs! So nice to hear from you. My only sister had her first baby yesterday, so we are visiting her. Busy! &lt;3
@StaceyLRicks :)
He's finally in the only type of program that has any kind of good results. If he "tries," it should help. If it doesn't, nothing will.
The same with the husband. I have a choice. Part of the deal with the program he's in - it covers the "I'm trying" stuff from him.
What's important is that I get a choice about being around her, and about whether I accept that her behavior is the only definition of love.
You know, the important thing about all this stuff with my family is not that there's anything wrong with my mom or how she operates.
@mazzie Thank you. I feel the same. Happy to know you. :) and one of these days I'll make it down that way. :)
@mazzie Hahahaha! :)
@mazzie &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 (although, somebody talked about fart emojis, so now those just look like little butts to me......)
@randomjeweler Yeah, her perception may change with some more time. I hope so.
@randomjeweler I know feminism as a movement has real issues, but girls need feminism for stuff like that!
@randomjeweler Right? She gives the boys in this story so much slack as a given, and she carved out just enough selfishness to *stay alive.*
@mazzie No, it really meant a lot to me to have someone act interested! I'm still trying to learn that happens! :P &lt;3 &lt;3
@mazzie Thanks for listening. It's really hard for me to think about this stuff around my birth family. Bc this is just how things are.
@randomjeweler Yeah, I feel like this girl could use a whole lot less guilt about the whole situation, and some more anger. :(
@mazzie Yeah, I think my mom wouldn't know how to process that. Except maybe as she's Bad and she'd feel Guilty.
@mazzie They would tell you they like me, love me, tried to take care of me, what more do I want?
@mazzie It feels oddly demanding to even articulate what I mean. I mean, they fed and clothed me, and sent me to therapy when I needed it.
@mazzie ... I realized I don't remember *any* relationships when someone was interested in me for my own self.
@mazzie I'm still struggling to articulate it. But in looking at my marriage and analyzing the lack of interest in me as a person there...
@mazzie I think she talks more to my dad than anybody. I think they'd say they're close. But even they have topics they basically avoid.
@mazzie I would have told you we were close until not too long ago. So I grew up thinking this level of interest was what close was!
@mazzie The hard part is I think she thinks we're close? She'd never say "oh, yeah, I'm distant." I don't think she has that insight?
I'm tired of feeling like I have to guess when I'm wanted/unwanted bc no one will tell the truth. Tired of hearing "love" w/o "interest."
You know, it sounds to me like I'm whining that I'm not the center of attention. I'm not! I'm just tired of the mixed signals.
Maybe that's part of what nags at me. For most people, arm's length is temporary. With her, the guard never comes down. It's permanent.
She talks to me like I'm a pleasant acquaintance she just met, not her daughter.
I just get really confused. Because my mom says she loves me, and cares about me, but acts, well, generally disinterested.
@Lookin4MyHappy Thanks.
And I'm not saying I dropped it on her at a busy time or anything. There was nothing else going on.
I mean, wouldn't you ask questions, if someone you cared about shared that with you? Ask about how it works, ask what changed?
I told my mom about my husband going into the program for abusive men, and she barely had anything to say.
They all don't really know me. Which is not for lack of me trying to share, but I just make all of them uncomfortable.
So now I'm alone with my kids, full of weird feelings about how I fit into this family.
@mylifeasprose Yes. Having the strong argument against it helps a lot. Exactly. &lt;3
However, my 4 yo and 20 mo are anything but quiet and invisible. So I went back to my parents' house with them.
If I didn't have kids, I'd still be at the hospital, trying to stay out of the way and be invisible.
@mylifeasprose It is. I think it's a fault more than a virtue, but it is what it is.
I'm super happy he's finally here.
My sister had her baby boy! Surprised us by coming a few hours earlier than they forecast. My mom and I were out to breakfast.
@mylifeasprose The upshot is, when this doesn't work, I'll really feel like I did all I could and maybe be able to divorce w/o guilt.
@mylifeasprose I'm glad he's doing it, but frankly my hopes for change aren't very high.
@mylifeasprose So that's the big news over here - besides my sister having a baby today or tomorrow. :) would love to hear your update. :)
@mylifeasprose So that means they officially evaluated him as abusive and controlling, which helps make me feel less crazy.
@mylifeasprose Did I tell you my husband started a program for abusive men? Had his 3rd individ session Tuesday. Moving on to group nxt wk.
I told the other one to lay down. I hear noises that suggest she's playing with my mom's stuffed animals instead.
Arrrrrgh. They are both still awake. Trying to nurse little one, so she doesn't just have to cry it out right next to my parents' bedroom.
@mylifeasprose &lt;3 How are you?
I totally didn't plan for a party in the middle of the night. I just drove 8 hrs. I am so done w these children.
Made it to my parents' by midnight. The kid woke up and have been refusing to sleep for an hour &amp; a half bc Oma and Opa's house is too fun.
Waiting for preschooler to get out of school, then going to drive across the great states of PA and OH.
@BathysphereHat I found DBT helpful with my therapist, and I don't ever remember feeling condescended to like that.
@BathysphereHat Is it helpful to hear that I find that response unsatisfactory, too?
Althooo, the appearance of the villain is creeping me out, bc this is exactly the act of my brother in law. ~~shudder~~
@tylikcat I'm sorry. Sometimes what passes for maternal care to ppl outside the situation is anything but.
How does the CW manage to get me attached to shows I should hate? I do NOT like zombies. But iZombie is surprisingly charming.
@tylikcat My MIL definitely shields a lot of controlling, manipulative behavior behind "maternal care."
@tylikcat :( You know, I'm only slowly coming to understand how terrible threats can be to kids, even when never carried out.
I find the choice to use "Caucasian" and "black" in the same article problematic.
@tylikcat I'm sorry. :( I see what you're saying. There are manipulations that are acceptable and even expected from women.
LRT: Of course, that last article has me thinking about who gets to say "no." How we police that decision more for some, &amp; less for others.
@LouisatheLast I'm sorry your friend has had to deal with that. :(
@LouisatheLast I think this has to be common. I mean, it affects, to greater or lesser degrees, LOTS of the convos ai have about abuse.
And also keep in mind that my mom grew up in a more difficult family situation, and has had to deal w the affects of sexism all her life.
Just trying to keep that in mind as I head out to see them. I want to figure out how to have high expectations of both of them.
@tylikcat How do you mean it hid under the cultural expectations of women?
He gets to be the unmovable object that all others move around.
My dad in his older age gets to play the quiet unassuming bear of a man. His apathy gets to be played as easy going.
Specifically, how my internalized sexism leads me to have higher emotional expectations for my mom than my dad.
Thinking on sexism this morning and how it plays out in families.
@beckykid Ah. Well, hopefully it's more helpful than annoying! And gets there, one way or the other...
@beckykid Why don't you want to wear it?
@beckykid :( That's the kind of thing it sucks to wait for.
@beckykid @amazon I suggest call. The only time that has happened to me, it never showed up. &amp; they were nasty to me about waiting to call.
@LouisatheLast Good to know! I will probably be headed back that way on a Friday, so that may work better.
@LouisatheLast I had my doubts! It's ok, I'm going back in a couple of weeks. I'll check again. :)
@LouisatheLast Hey, it looks like I might be able to stop by on Sunday. Is your bakery open on Sunday?
@nevernotdoing All of this!!!
And, to be clear, all the criticisms of White Lady Feminism that I have seen are the former, not the latter.
I am for ALL the criticism that will ultimately make feminism better. Not criticism that says it's not needed or it's bad.
@sillermoon Yes, all this, exactly. Thank you.
@jennygadget And then it's self-perpetuating. And it might be really interesting to see what's allowed to hit that point.
@jennygadget This is true. Honestly, though, I feel like there's some kind of "popularity point" where it just becomes ubiquitous. A Thing.
@glassblowerscat Yes. Good news. :)
@quicksilvre Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel.
@hubbit &lt;3 &lt;3
Hey, pocket friends, I would not have gotten to this point without you. Thank you for believing me first. Thank you.
Also! Just got another phone call, and there is a support group downtown for abused women that may have childcare, that is during the day!
@danileekelley YES. I mean, I love y'all so much, but this guys talked to HIM. Saw it in person! Huzzah!
@jennygadget @kateiscrafty I would read these! I want to think more about this. And compare to Frozen.
@tylikcat @jennygadget This is such an excellent idea.
@libraryyeti @peacefultaru It is very good news to be believed. Such good news. &lt;3 &lt;3
@kateiscrafty I hope so.
So I can calm down about one thing - the abuse program called, and yes, they think he's abusive. ::confetti::
...feminist like "Ever After" becomes a cult film, but Frozen (not that feminist, to me) and a less feminist Cinderella can be popular.
Frankly, the feminist in me is wondering how much pressure we put on what "girls" are allowed to enjoy in peace, so something explicitly...
@quicksilvre Oh, wow. Yeah.
I do think there's a social aspect - and I think we don't think about that enough.
@quicksilvre That does sound terrible.
But clearly some girl films are Huge (Titanic, Frozen), and others merely do ok/well (Brave, Ever After)...
@quicksilvre Oh, what happened in the alternate ending?
Which is probably attributable to the "huh! Girls have economic power??" blind spot of the media, that never seems to go away.
Kind of the way they seem a little surprised by Frozen now, to be honest...
Marketing played a role, I'm sure, but everybody seemed mystified about why Titanic made so much money. @kateiscrafty
@quicksilvre I finally watched it  a couple of years ago and was not blown away, I'll admit. I expect more of my female protags nowadays!
@quicksilvre Middle school is so terrible that way.
I never went once. I quietly refused to see it for YEARS. (No one noticed, bc my "friends" were more like acquaintances...)
Seriously. I was in high school when Titanic came out. It was my friends that were going multiple times.
@SpaceAgNicole Yes! It is wonderful.
There are many things I don't understand. One of them is why Ever After is a cult film and Titanic made so much ridiculous money.
@SpaceAgNicole it's on Netflix! (I'm making it clear I love this movie, I think...) ;)
@SpaceAgNicole I actually disagree w Danielle as a "static" character, but I get why she would say that.
@SpaceAgNicole I feel reassured now! :)
... But I am annoyed that you can call it a "step backward" compared to Frozen and Maleficent and NOT mention Ever After.
Ever After was a thing of beauty and the new Cinderella will inevitably fall short. ...
It makes me so sad that I am hearing about Cinderella and not hearing more about Ever After.
"black people must extend a hand in love"
"racism is a dated concept" 
@nevernotdoing I'm glad somebody other than me thinks it's funny! &lt;3
@greatersafety: So... going to a codependency group that was majority men and not feminist felt a bit like this: 
@stuckinspincycl Only in my mind. Only in my mind. ;)
Went to a support group this evening where two of the men in their sharing referred to women as "females." ::sigh::
@StaceyLRicks Today it did feel that way. How is school?
@StaceyLRicks Thank you. &lt;3
@mamasnark Thank you. &lt;3
@rtgarden Thank you. &lt;3
@PriestessAmy Thank you. &lt;3
More adulting: calling an acquaintance for help watching kid for therapy appointments. That makes 4 phone calls! Impressive for today.
@quicksilvre Aw, thank you. &lt;3 It means a lot to me that people will weather times like this with me.
@jennygadget Thank you!
@quicksilvre &lt;3 &lt;3
I am utterly drowned in awesome high fives, which has floored me a bit. Love you all.
@hubbit Sometimes it really is.
@glassblowerscat Excellent. :) Thank you!
@SpaceAgNicole Yes! Super high five!
@kingdomofwench Thank you! &lt;3
@Vims8 Thank you!
@unxpctdblessing Thank you. &lt;3
@nevernotdoing It is. It so is. Thank you.
@sawilcox28 Thank you!
@hubbit Thank you! &lt;3
... And go to an appt with my GP to take about antidepressants, which I'm my sure I want but I'm making myself go and talk to her anyway.
I am now going to get my 20 mo who is away from nap, get my other kid from preschool, go make keys for the pet sitter, ...
I called my uncle to get help with lawyers. I called Women in Transition here in Philly about a support group.
I called to set up pet sitting so I can go see my sister in Ohio to have her baby.
Hey, pocket friends, who wants to give me a high five for crawling off my bathroom floor (where I was being anxious) &amp; doing adulting?
@the_amphibian It's all right. Thanks for listening. :)
@the_amphibian Thank you.
@the_amphibian Oh, definitely. My feelings were always a problem to be fixed or controlled.
@the_amphibian Yes. I hear that.
@the_amphibian ... the consequences of your family getting tired of you are so great.
@the_amphibian Yeah, my family got overwhelmed by my depression constantly. You can have compassion for it, but ...
@the_amphibian Yes, that's how I feel. I can't remember when I didn't feel like a burden.
@Mama_Laura_Z Thank you for saying so. Just hard to believe.
@the_amphibian I know what you mean, but when I know other people are not getting help, then I have a lot of trouble accepting it.
@aboleyn I haven't seen any. That would be interesting to try to find out.
All I have to show for the last fourteen years of my life are degrees I don't know how to make use of and 2 kids I'm terrified of losing.
I'm sure there are flaws in my thinking - like the fact that gender isn't the only factor to think about in who he calls on.
I'm thinking there need to be ongoing efforts. He needs to do that every other press conference. Or call half women every conference.
I've been thinking of that press conference where Obama only called on women. Isn't it indeed "just a stunt" of he only did it once?
It's so fucking creepy when my husband breaks out the apologies. It's not reassuring. It's fucking scary.
...  just that I've utterly failed to convince her to sleep through the night.
20 mo has been awake for hours. I can't tell if it's more teething, picking up on my stress, or ...
@glassblowerscat This is true.
@glassblowerscat If it affected other ppl, they got the right to control the situation enough so it stopped affecting them.
@glassblowerscat The msg was often that my depression isn't my fault, but I owe it to other ppl not to let it affect them.
@glassblowerscat My birth family's fucked up in this way, too, even though both my parents are depressed and being treated for it.
"He tends to rapidly decide that his group leaders are as crazy as his partner and heads for the door."
"This style of man rarely lasts long in an abuser program unless he has a court order."
"You may feel that you overreact to his behavior and that he isn't really so bad."
"You may struggle for years to try to figure out what is happening."
"His moves appear carefully thought out, &amp; he rarely makes obvious mistakes... That could turn ppl against him or get him in legal trouble."
@toomuchaubrey Thank you.
@toomuchaubrey I just - honestly - I know listening to me some days is hard. It's ok if you don't.
@toomuchaubrey Well, I'm pretty worried about me, today, TBH. Today has been hard. But I don't like upsetting people.
And notice how it's still centered on me and controlling me, even if it's something benign like "making" me happy?
The way he talks, you'd think he was going to a support group for men with crazy wives.
The tack my husband has been taking with this program is that he wants to learn better ways to "make me feel supported."
Then they can declare the other person as crazy or out of control or otherwise the problem.
The Water Torturer's tactics can make the other party blow their top or feel inferior or some combination.
"He tends to take things she has said and twist them beyond recognition in order to make her appear absurd..."
He uses "his own evenness as a weapon to push her over the edge."
"The Water Torturer proves that anger doesn't cause abuse. He can assault his partner psychologically w/o even raising his voice."
Like I tweeted before, my husband is closest to The Water Torturer style in Why Does He Do That.
It makes it sound like they've been feeding him anger management crap, which will NOT help.
One thing that really makes me frightened is that he said something about "I'm sorry. This makes me angry, blah blah blah."
I'm fucking terrified. Partly bc he pulled the "I'm DOING what they SAID, why do you still think negatively of me?!"
(TW: SI, self harm) I can't go to court and say "my husband is so bad for me he leads me to self harm." That just slaps CRAZY on me.
(TW: SI, self harm) But that bit of clarity doesn't even help bc of the stigma around that behavior.
(TW: SI, self harm) I was horrified years ago when I realized that he was the thing triggering self harming, how he eroded my coping.
@_L1vY_ He's so dang good at it. I mean, we've known each other for a decade.
(TW: SI, self harm) I sometimes feel the urge in other contexts, but it is totally manageable other than with him.
(TW: SI, self harm) I haven't harmed myself, in, wow, years. Not even a little. Not even planned for it. Never let myself do it.
I'm never going to get out. I'm the one sitting in a corner, crying, and he's fine.
Depression. Fuck. It's the evidence that there's something wrong, but it points to a flaw in me. He can so easily play suffering husband.
I wish I had people in my face to face life who believed me. But I don't.
I should have put my foot down years ago, instead of trying to reason with him alone.
Please, please. Let them either kick him out for noncompliance so I can move on, or let him quit. Or let the program actually work.
Just come out with more therapized language to beat me over the head with.
God, I am praying with all my being that it's a good program and that he doesn't go through six months with them and
I worry that this program is just going to be training ground for him to learn more things to be used as tools on me.
It's so fucking creepy. My husband has turned all the language they teach you to use into psychological weapons.
@ZippyKittyToo It's the only ending I have for now. I like to think she'll do more, but that's hard to imagine from where I'm at.
@kateiscrafty I feel glad you're getting free, though. I'm still so terrified. I'm worried about court and custody SO much.
@kateiscrafty Honestly, I'm afraid mine will never give up the charade. Bc it's so much easier in some ways when they are blatant.
@kateiscrafty His style is much more about quiet superiority and condescension.
@kateiscrafty My husband is too slick for that.
It's incredibly disheartening that every time I approach them their responses haven't gained any nuance since the last time.
Despite the fact that I don't tend to bring it up unless it's desperate or I'm about to change something, that has happened over &amp; over.
The background to this is that I have *had* the conversation about abuse with my family before. Repeatedly.
I was basically struck dumb at the time. It was like she had just finally tuned in to the conversation.
... and my mom said, with a bit of surprised, dismissive dismay, "Why, you're talking like an abused woman."
I was trying to express my fears about being believed, ...
I still am sort of bewildered at times by a convo with my mom the last time they visited, when I tried to get them up to speed.
I have never figured out how to talk to any of them about abuse or my marriage. I have, at times, but only when desperate.
I'm not really looking forward to being around my family. I will go when the baby comes, bc baby, but I'm nervous as hell.
"Darling," she said to the lizard, "I think from now on I will take my breakfast in my room."

~fin~

#story
It certainly seemed to be making breakfast awkward. #story
She didn't know what to do. But she decided that "noticing it less" was not helping. #story
Of course, now that it had been years, she couldn't go running around shouting "the king is a lizard!" and expect that to go well. #story
It had been years and years now, and he was indeed not as scary of a lizard as it once was, but here he was - still a lizard. #story
And she was a dutiful queen, and she loved him, so she would. Notice it less. #story
He would also often stress that it would be easier for him to be less lizardly, if she... just... noticed it less. #story
There had been many discussions, which often ended with him offering to work on being less lizard like. #story
He had always been this way. In fact, sometimes he had been an even bigger lizard. #story
While thinking, she realized she knew many of the answers. #story
She pondered possible responses. 'Stop being a lizard.' 'Do you realize you're a lizard?' 'Have you always been this way?' #story
"My dear," said the lizard, quite gently, "you seem to do this every morning. I hate to see you so distressed. What can I do?" #story
A gentle scratch came at the door, and the lizard came in, and walked over near her. #story
She went to her bedchamber, and sat by the window, and tried to think. What did this mean? What could she do? #story
Understandably distressed, and also very confused, she made her polite excuses (she was still a queen, after all) and left the room. #story
Nonetheless, there he was, a lizard, swallowing eggs whole with their shells on and staring at her with unblinking yellow eyes. #story
Or perhaps he had always been a lizard, and she had only just noticed? The servants seemed unconcerned. #story
One day the queen was sitting at breakfast and she realized the king had turned into a lizard. #story
@glassblowerscat nature of it is designed to be covert even from me. :/

@peacefultaru Thank you. *hugs*
@kingdomofwench I wish I had better shorthand for the way talking to the husband can leave me so shaky sometimes. Thanks.
@kingdomofwench Thank you! *hugs*
Anybody around for a hug?
@OhDianeMarie @sassycrass Awwwwww. ::internet hugs::
@sassycrass Well, @OhDianeMarie said she's going on a CRUISE today, so she can't be THAT jealous of us. ;)
@jennygadget writes women. Which is kind of how that came off. Admittedly, they put him in that position, but... he could have said no.
@jennygadget Honestly, I'll take a "I don't write many women, I don't know them" author over a guy who will pontificate about how well he
@jennygadget I haven't read any of his books, even tho the consensus seems to be they are So Good, but that article makes me hate him a bit.
UGH I hate asking people to watch my children. It feels like grad school level social interaction to try to not mess this up. Actual terror.
@peacefultaru Road trips I will pester you. ;)
@peacefultaru But yes! I would LOVE to get together and play Scrabble. I will put that on the dream list and when I have the spoons to try
@peacefultaru It just seemed rude! Also, this is one reason why Settlers of Cataan is so good, to me. Short learning curve.
@peacefultaru No, I know that feeling. My husband &amp; I used to play Scrabble a LOT &amp; I genuinely did not like playing against other people.
@peacefultaru @OhDianeMarie I want to play Scrabble with you! (And it counts!)
@peacefultaru @OhDianeMarie Y'all are making me want to go on another cruise. My one and only was... well it makes a good story. ;)
@peacefultaru @OhDianeMarie Hahaha. Good deal for your mom. :) &lt;3
@keetfeet Me TOO. Whine away!
@OhDianeMarie Good luck! With the hair. I am no good at hair/pretty things. Mwah!!
Sharing cold 6am pizza with the 20mo. Livin' the good life.
@OhDianeMarie I probably need to reread it periodically, bc it really makes me think about my experience in engineering differently.
@OhDianeMarie 
@OhDianeMarie That reminds me, there was an awesome Captain Awkward post about sexism recently. Did you see it?
@OhDianeMarie But seriously, it sounds like a very pleasant time. I am so excited for you!
@OhDianeMarie I do believe that. I always believe it. ~~sigh~~
@OhDianeMarie The rainbow comment is not as random as it seems - the one cruise I've been on there was a nice one. Beautiful.
@OhDianeMarie Oh, so there will a million photographers there, who know how to take flattering pictures of you in front of rainbows? ;)
@OhDianeMarie Oooo! Where to?
@OhDianeMarie :) So why are you up? It's not morning yet, there, right?
@OhDianeMarie Also, in case it's not clear, I get to see the rest of @sassycrass, too.
@OhDianeMarie Whatever, though, bc @sassycrass's inner Martha Stewart is making me lunch today! ::claps excitedly::
@OhDianeMarie Well, tonight is basically over... Hello, 6 am! :P
@OhDianeMarie It is nice to feel like the last few days of her waking up all the time actually achieved something?
I am awake at an unreasonable hour, and barely slept. Related: kiddo appears to have a new canine!
@butterflyzan I'm really happy to hear things are going better. &lt;3
@butterflyzan I wish I could convince myself it will work out in the long run, for both my kids and me. I have a hard time doing that.
Anyway. Just gotta do it. Stop avoiding it, and let the whole house of cards fall down. 5/5
@brassiest Thank you. So much. &lt;3
@Kishmishiani Thank you. That reassures me. I've been waiting for a call from them all wk and I've been so worried about messing it up.
@brassiest Thank you. &lt;3 I really appreciate it. I have a hard time complaining when it seems like I have so little to complain about.
@Kishmishiani Thank you. &lt;3 He just started a program for abusers. So I'm most worried currently about them believing me.
I need to talk to a lawyer. Which means I need to ask my family for help. Which means I actually have to update them. Been avoiding that. 4/
I feel more sure that it is indeed abuse, and less sure that anyone outside will believe me or be able to help. Or that he will change. 2/
Last couple of days seeing more through the husband and I'm both reassured and worried. 1/
Despite the fact that I passed Circuits in college, things are happening that I don't understand!

It's fairly robust - kid can snap pieces together and put them the wrong way, and it just doesn't work.
It's modular pieces that snap together to make electrical circuits. SO cool. 
I bought this 
Y'all, today has turned out pretty ok. Wish I could hug some of you and share the happy.
@runningnekkid Well, I wasn't so much expecting thinking as maybe some word vomit? You know, if that lowers the expectations... ;)
@runningnekkid Mostly I wanted to hear more about your ideas? Needed something fun and interesting for my brain to chew on.
@runningnekkid listen. Having a preschooler and a teen in the house... Of course it's never ending.
@runningnekkid Hey HeY HEY. Poking you in hopes your kids are at school like mine is and I can pester you for a bit?? :sad puppy dog eyes:
In other news, in the Why Does He Do That? book, closest type of abuser to him was The Water Torturer. Sounds cheery, huh?
That thing where my husband is being manipulative, says "why don't I stay here and you just go by yourself??" and I say "Well, sure, ok."
@ZippyKittyToo :(
@ZippyKittyToo You don't sleep right bc 6 is still waking up, or bc of lingering effects on your sleep pattern ?
I'm starting to think what killed the dinosaurs was babies that wake up 3 x in the night, and won't go back to bed w/o an hour of nursing.
Even the most basic of help or emotional support or ~listening~ are undeserved things I'll need to pay for - sooner or later.
When your basic self-concept is one of your own worthlessness, that warps everything.
@runningnekkid Hey! I clearly got distracted by PANIC, which is not at all helpful and rather annoying. :P thank you.
@glassblowerscat Sort of the nature of the beast! If I had good options, I would have taken one of them.
I just have a hard time getting around the helplessness of it. I hate feeling like a leech. Things I can't repay.
I need to work on that internal sense of shame. I srsly doubt the couple I stayed w for a few months years ago wld want me to feel beholden.
@LouisatheLast Yes. Especially when it's presented as loving and wanting to be together.
I really do need to win the lottery or something.
When I accept that help, I'll be waiting for the favor to get called in, forever. I'll be waiting for the shame and guilt to rain down.
The vulnerability of that position worries me so much. I'll *need* help, and ppl will offer it (which is a privileged position, I know) then
@LouisatheLast The wanting to spend all free time together and acting if there's something wrong if you want to do something w/o them. Yeah.
I keep imagining myself trying to stay functional through a protracted custody battle, alone, trying to take care of two kids.
All of my interactions &amp; expectations are warped, so if a friendship does go beyond the surface level, it tends to be unhealthy in some way.
Experiencing abuse itself is isolating. I'm a stranger. I have what feels like a big dark secret sometimes. Add to that MH stigma.
People think of the isolation of abuse like it's all him saying "you can't see your friends!" That happens, but that's not really it for me.
Heck, I am barely succeeding at keeping up pretenses with acquaintances now.
So if I can't imagine accepting help, then I'll just be alone after a divorce. Bc I'll be a mess. Won't exactly be socializing material.
I'm still carrying shame and guilt around from accepting help the last time I divorced my husband, almost a decade ago.
But truthfully they're the only people I can imagine accepting help from without guilt.
I've been struggling with the parents thing this week - I think there's some real dark stuff I need to figure out.
If I divorce my husband, I can't honestly think of what I would do with myself. I don't want to move near my parents.
Part of what's come up for me this week has been realizing how isolated I really am.
Following tweets: if you find yourself wanting to reply with "you have to" "you should" or some version of "you'll work it out!": don't.
@TX_Lisa Someday... it will probably pass without me realizing it, like all the other milestones. :)
@TX_Lisa I can dream! :)
I put the baby down an hour ago and she's already up crying again. Usually she makes it until 11 or so? This does not bode well.
@quicksilvre Hugs! I've done that. Not fun. :(
I have spent a big chunk of this week physically hunched over from tension. I don't even know what to do that would help. Wait, I guess.
@peacefultaru @libraryyeti Yay cold connections!! Also, glitter is bad.
Maybe that's just my family? Can't ever tell the truth, so they deal in platitudes that spackle over the difficult specifics?
Replacing a specific criticism or doubt about my parenting with a general platitude.
But too often it's like they're applying "if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."
I suppose if it was used in response to me actually doing something good, I might like it better...
I don't know how to say this to my sister without being misunderstood, but I really dislike it when people say "you're a good mom" to me.
@Kishmishiani ~~sending you love~~ It's nice to have you back.
@Layogenic Aw, thank you. It means so much to me when ppl like you listen to me without needing to fix or run away. It's a huge gift. &lt;3
@Layogenic I *so* know that feeling. I spend a lot of time trying to make myself easy to avoid, bc I hate idea of ppl just putting up w me.
@Layogenic Hey just saw the rest of your TL and in case it's helpful to say this explicitly, all jokes aside I am glad to know you.
@Layogenic Haha. Naw. I just unfollowed a magazine, instead. I think since already culled all the guys I don't actually talk to, already! ;)
OMG I must follow @fractweet. I'm at my max (again). Which white guy shall I remove so I can make space??
@OhDianeMarie Aww, thank you. *hugs*
Waiting for that phone call has definitely been one of my stressors this week. Waiting to find out if they believe me.
I'm so terrified they're going to send both of us away and declare him not abusive if I say the wrong thing. :( 6/6
They're supposed to call me at some point to talk to me about his intake into the program, &amp; I am so nervous bc of stuff like this. 5/
And now I feel all cringey bc that sounded so patronizing to him and how will they ever believe he's abusive NOW? 4/
"We don't generally have a problem with him doing that kind of fabrication, but I'd still like to check." 3/
I made a comment about if it was ok to confirm he had really gone to two individual sessions already, and said 2/
I feel ridiculous. Had to call the abuser program to figure out what day of the week group sessions are, left a msg. 1/
When I get back to writing again I need to write more about UUism.
@libraryyeti BRAIN TWINZ
@_L1vY_ It was disappointing! And me leaving just made me look like a flake. :(
@libraryyeti OMG I almost sent you that, but then I said "aw, that might be a bit much, no?" I LOVE YOU.
All I could do was leave. Walk away. I created a once a month contemporary service there, and I walked away from it.
The minister, who in my opinion should have at the *very least* retired, simply moved on to another church.
I'm mad bc my UU church I attended as an adult messed up some very serious things, and nothing was done.
I'm actually really, really mad at #UUism. So mad that I don't even know how to engage with it w/o earning some kind of negative label.
@theoriesofminds @SubOptOutcome It doesn't surprise me that much, sadly. Out of sight, out of mind...
@libraryyeti Are you on a boat?
@theoriesofminds @SubOptOutcome I would so love to talk to more ppl who were raised UU but now aren't.
@riotheatherrr @theoriesofminds Well, also UUism is very "intellectual" friendly. Sometimes to a fault.
@theoriesofminds them in a few years longer than they would have stayed otherwise. (They left when I was in middle school ish).
@theoriesofminds Huh. I didn't know that. That's about the era my parents joined. They joined before kids, but I think having kids in kept
@theoriesofminds Yes. Boomer or even older, in cases. I was valuable for my "energy," not necessarily for my ideas...
@theoriesofminds I didn't hear a lot interest in understanding the issue. Some of that is prob bc I was so "junior" (I was 30).
@theoriesofminds I was active as an adult in a UU church just 2 yrs ago &amp; something appropriative came up, and
@theoriesofminds Yes. Absolutely. :(
@theoriesofminds Thank you! Appropriation is just one of the many things UUism still handles badly. :/
@theoriesofminds I'd be interested, if you think of it. I'm seriously considering just being a "friend" of a UU church so my kids can do RE.
@theoriesofminds Wow, I was just about to tweet abt how I think I can't go back to UUism. It was not good as an adult. Is it ok to RT?
@Spacekatgal The problem with this kind of statement is that it's often used to silence women engaging in useful, important critiques.
Of course, my last tweet's a little ironic, bc #BeforeTwitterI didn't know how rampant online abuse was or the dynamics of it.
@AureliaCotta Yes, that's fine. :)
#BeforeTwitterI had a hard time finding people to safely talk to about abuse.
@sophiaphotos #teamodo
@sophiaphotos &lt;3 I was rewatching DS9 not that long ago and the urge to livetweet it is pretty huge. Odo is very quotable.
Added: the anxiety was vastly outweighed by the feeling of resonance, of going "oh yeah he does that, this is real."
It wasn't so bad, though, and I'm glad I have a physical copy now. It's highly recommended for a reason. 3/3
Partly I think it was wanting to avoid stories of other's abuse, which often makes me extremely anxious. And there was some of that. 2/
I'm not sure why it took me so long to read "Why Does He Do That?" after having it repeatedly recommended. 1/
@saalon @mightybattlecat All the feelings are ok, even the "feeling like a fraud" ones!
@saalon Well, as @mightybattlecat said, feelings are not wrong. And a loss is a loss. It's ok to be a mess, and process however you need to.
@saalon I'm sorry about your friend. :(
@kingdomofwench THANK YOU. &lt;3
@kingdomofwench I don't want to read that, I just want some1 to hug me &amp; tell me it's ok my 20 mo runs my nighttime life right now.
Every plan I come up with is bad. Everything I do or think right now is bad. I'm a thorny little knot of frozen shame.
... awful I am to live with. On the one hand I want to defend myself from all the shaming, &amp; on the other, that shame is internal, too.
But every time I try to get myself back in gear and do things I think about the anger and resentment I imagine my husband has for how
I am tired of the house feeling trashed and feeling so frozen.
@FeministaJones Good morning, and thank you for all you do. :)
No, *your* toddler woke up at 5:15 and played Mommy Jungle Gym until you got up. ~~sigh~~
@coreydu Did you hire any of the highly qualified POC who speak, write, &amp; tweet (!) about racism to consult for your #racetogether campaign?
@brassiest *\o/*
I guess I'll go unload the car while she screams for a bit.
So my options are 1) screaming or 2) her sleeping in lap, which doesn't allow me the few minutes of "off" time I will have all day.
I have fucked my entire day. Screwed up baby's nap, so now she won't sleep other than in my lap - tried twice already.
I would rather a company just DO right on race (which is hard, which is why they don't do it), than talk about it as a PR stunt.
I would really like to see pressure on companies to take care of all of their workers and listen to them. Not "goodwill campaigns."
Add "kind" to the list of words I don't trust anymore. (See also: "nice.")
And I didn't identify any of it as sexism at the time. At all.
LRT: I kind of don't have words. Bc I KNOW that guy. LOTS of that guy. That's like my *whole* experience in engineering and math.
So yeah, "don't eat the science!" is meant to be playful. I hope my daughters find a balance.
My strongest memories of a lot of "scientific" things is not playful, but about the safety rules and a fear of screwing up.
I have been thinking about rules all day, and safety, and how girls tend to be better rule followers.
She hollered for my help, though, instead of trying to eat it, so there's that.
I am, in general, teaching bad lab safety today, I think. Letting kiddo eat while painting, so yes cottage cheese fell in the paint.
Also, this was our result. Very pretty: 
This is not age appropriate for 4 yos. Just something she thinks is funny, lately. So I had to make "don't eat the science!" a clear rule!
Did a science project with different densities of salt water today. (Bought the kit at Michael's.) 4 yo kept trying to lick things.
Have you heard of @Shakestweetz (LRTs). You probably have, but if you haven't, check out Shakesville. She writes awesome things.
@PrettyAllTrue I see you. You come along and say thank you, and then I see another post to RT! Nefarious. Nefarious, I say. ;)
@saalon Maybe I just got annoyed bc I just wanted DS9 to always my fuzzy friendly banter fest. Which is about me.
@saalon Garibaldi's plotline, Sheridan's torture, the complexity of Londo's character and choices... Had a huge effect on me.
@saalon times really horrific for me as a high schooler. Enough that I hesitate at the idea of rewatching.
@saalon I don't know. I need to think about it more. Part of why I think I was slotting B5 in my head as "good" just now was bc it was at
@saalon I think I agree with you in that it changed directions after that some? And was more local and I liked it better.
@saalon There was one episode in early season 4 I think w Jake going to the front lines that irritated the crap out of me. Too preachy.
@saalon Something else B5 did so much better...
@saalon You know, I was rewatching DS9 &amp; I stepped away for a while bc they got into the Dominion War and they just did not write war well.
@saalon Ex: "we must deal the deal with sex" episode. Might be my favorite ever.
@saalon I'm thinking about it, and the hardass stuff is probably why I love the other stuff so much? But yeah.
@saalon It's odd to me that I don't remember this speech at all and mainly remember the funny moments of Ivanova.
It was all so congenial and good natured and cooperative. My kid is fabulous. &lt;3
OMG y'all, my kid just gave me choices and said "whichever you choose is ok" and went with my choice, just like I do for her.
@jennygadget Thinking about you doing this for Women's History month just made my whole day. &lt;3
@jennygadget YAAAAY!!!
Better yet, you can buy photo paper that does something similar. It's super fun. Do it yourselves, and then tell them about Anna Atkins.
To add: tell a girl in your life about Anna Atkins! Tell a boy. Tell them about these funny blue photos she made with plants.
@jennygadget You are right about the extra pressure of being better than all before. And when you aren't, that feels like failure.
@jennygadget I know now about sexism, culture, harassment. I wish I had been prepared, you know?
@jennygadget Not just that! You don't get to learn from them. I wish, when I was looking at engineering, someone had told me everything
I wish someone had told me about Anna Atkins as a kid, instead of platitudes like "you can do whatever you set your mind to." 5/5
To realize women were there all along, always awesome, doing great things within the space allowed them. 4/
This keeps happening to me, and it hurts in a funny way. 3/
We even had an acquaintance that was very into it, who lent me books and had his own darkroom. He never mentioned her. Didn't know? 2/
LRT: in middle school, I was very interested in photography. Read several books about the history. Never heard of Anna Atkins. 1/
@jennygadget Yesssss. Now I have it (the Internet is magic) and I'm excited. Thank you!
@jennygadget No, I've never heard of it! Will go find it. &lt;3
IF THE TRANSMISSION DIES
YO CAR COSTS MONEY LOTSANDLOTSAMONEY
BUTCHAHAVETUHDRIVE 
@jennygadget :( Yeah. Ugh.
@jennygadget A sad, exhausted giggle, because it's true. I mean, look at the reaction to K Tempest Bradford. ~~sigh~~
And then I giggled. &lt;3 @jennygadget
I was thinking "I just want @jennygadget to tell me what to read, so I avoid Stupid Boy authors," &amp; I thought they'd prob cry Censorship!!
@jennygadget I &lt;3 you.
I have had my eye on bedtime for 4 hours and I still have not succeeded yet in getting both kids in bed.
@peacefultaru Hooray! Yay chocolate chip cookies. :)
@peacefultaru Aw, cool. :)
@peacefultaru What was the game?
@peacefultaru Ah, the old "I have to do that to go to sleep, but this other thing is more fun..." :D
@peacefultaru Just anxious all afternoon and can't shake it.
@peacefultaru That sounds good. Today started ok - had a play date with another family with the preschooler, had a good lunch.
@peacefultaru yay! How was your Sunday?
Anybody bored and want to just chat with me about nothing?
@bridgetminamore The Long Kiss Goodnight!
It doesn't take much from him. Which makes me feel like it's my fault. And then I'm down the rabbit hole, and I can't function.
It is amazing how fast I spiral when I'm get unhappy and my husband gets irritated/impatient with me about it.
@OhDianeMarie And teach me to fold fitted sheets! Yes! ;)
@OhDianeMarie Ehhh, if I have to cut out a cube to put it in a bowl to warm it up, not sure I can take it.
@OhDianeMarie I figured, but that's the point! I like stock, I do NOT like bone broth. Not the same!!
@OhDianeMarie I am grossed out by gelatinous soup, so I never tried that again!
@OhDianeMarie Well, and isn't the thing with the bones that you get the gelatin? I made turkey "soup" once that turned to sludge when cold.

(Ridgeway, FRAMED BY GENDER) 
@mazzie This so makes me want to visit you. You and I can think we are hilarious together. ;)
Superhero stories for less than a buck! A sale on the anthology, and a free story from a friend of mine: 
@jasonpgignac I've had some practice by now. It gets easier.
@AureliaCotta or I'm divorcing him w a clear conscience. That clear conscience is something I didn't have last time, &amp; is important to me.
@AureliaCotta Either they'll convince him to make substantive change that feels like more than window dressing,
@AureliaCotta This program is a first stage of 10 group sessions, followed by an "advanced" stage of 20. So it's not nothing.
@AureliaCotta Oh, no. Not going to invest another decade into this. This will be resolved one way or another within a year.
@OhDianeMarie It so is. &lt;3
So @OhDianeMarie is tweeting bunnies with pancakes on their heads at people. This is good.
@drtantatinycat &lt;3
@kateiscrafty I'm hoping so. &lt;3
@AureliaCotta Do you think any of them change? Or you saying the programs don't work (this might be true) or my husband is a bad fit?
@AureliaCotta Watching him start this after wishing he would for so long has been sort of a shock. Realizing that it's more of the same.
@AureliaCotta You're probably right, he won't change.
I will tell them I do have depression and anxiety, but that he uses them as a convenient scapegoat instead of being supportive.
I'm just really hoping to say "I just want him to own his stuff up front, instead of only when he is totally cornered. I'm tired. So tired."
So if I make too big a deal out of small stuff, then I sound crazy. If I act too nonchalant, then they're going to say "why is he here?"
Of course, I'm nervous about talking to them, because my husband is going to be painting me as crazy and oversensitive.
They're also supposed to call me at some point. I don't have to talk to them, I guess?, but I like that they call.
The husband's program sent him home with a big questionnaire. Pretty detailed.
@saalon Really? I have the same thing you said where I confuse them. Totally blurred together. The emotional heft wasn't there for me.
@saalon I went in with low expectations bc of 2 &amp; 3 and was pleasantly surprised. It had its moments.
@saalon So, this is true, and science, but curious where you rate Legacy, the one w/Renner?
@diannaeanderson (They call pizza flatbread many, many places here. We were new in town.)
@diannaeanderson was confusing. I called him on it and he was just all "my opinion as a customer is useful." I was mortified.
@diannaeanderson My husband mansplained to a head chef (who was in the midst of interviewing for new staff) that "flatbread" for pizza
@LouisatheLast Absolutely. I will let you know as soon as I hear from my sister. Babies show up on their own schedules. :)
@ZippyKittyToo I know the dynamic you're talking about. That's worked in our favor at times.
@ZippyKittyToo I divorced him once, when we were much younger. We were apart for a year and a half.
That's not love. That's entitlement.
The crux of it is that it is clear to him that I *can* leave whenever, and he feels put upon and resentful of that fact.
Then he starts talking about "marriage" and "commitment" and how I'm not as "committed" as he is.
And that he might want things to be different, but that's just the way they were. "Different how?" I ask.
I pressed him on why that was funny, and it emerged that I'd "made it clear" that I could leave whenever I wanted.
"You're a grown ass woman, you can do whatever you want." And laughed.
Brought to you by me trying to point out to my husband that him going to therapy doesn't buy him anything, to which he responded:
Resolutions moving forward: avoid people as much as possible that mock the idea of my free agency.
@LouisatheLast Can I just check in w you once I know we're leaving, and we can see what might work? We're also going back first wk in Apr.
@LouisatheLast (We were actually in a place the other day, and 19 mo almost did it, and I sooo thought of you.)
@LouisatheLast Exactly. The long great state of PA.
@LouisatheLast We could stop by either on the way there, or back. I will try really hard not to let my kids lick the display cases.
@LouisatheLast Cool! My sister is supposed to have a baby any day and the plan is to drive out to OH for a few days and meet him.
@LouisatheLast This reminds me! Would it be weird if me and my kids came to your bakery?
@OhDianeMarie Of course, he'll feel taken to the cleaners if he does this and I still divorce him, but what can you do?
@OhDianeMarie *shrugs* If he goes through this program and it doesn't happen, then I'll feel like I've done all I could.
@OhDianeMarie He might not be capable of that. Lots of people aren't capable.
@OhDianeMarie Well, I should say what I meant was I need him to give up the fiction in order to 1) trust him &amp; 2) stay married long term.
@OhDianeMarie I absolutely know what you mean, but I am so tired of living in a box for my safety. So tired.
@OhDianeMarie Honestly, saying that - that he's *still* playing the good guy, just HARDER, helps me feel better about still being terrified.
@OhDianeMarie Sometimes. ;)
@OhDianeMarie And knowing that terrifies me. I need him to give up on the good guy fiction, but losing that could be explosive.
@OhDianeMarie We're still very much in this space of him trying to prove his status as a "good guy." Not to just do good, you know?
@OhDianeMarie He still feels entitled to my good regard, really, which completely shuts down that whole process.
@OhDianeMarie He made an effort to do those things. And that would be an iterative process, you know? Of gradually building trust.
@OhDianeMarie No. That would imply some kind of exchange where he said "what do you need to trust me?" And I said "x, y, and z." And then
@OhDianeMarie Been trying to learn more about forgiveness/ reconciliation. One idea is that 1 person can forgive, but 2 need to reconcile.
@OhDianeMarie Yes, I like that.
@OhDianeMarie That's a bare minimum, and I may or may not trust him in response. If I don't trust him, I'm not reneging on some bargain.
@OhDianeMarie I know ppl talk about "earning" trust, but in actuality that looks like "acting in a trustworthy way."
@OhDianeMarie I don't even know if trust is something you can "earn," in the sense that he's owed it, you know?
@OhDianeMarie *nods* HUGS. Dang, I'm glad I know you.
And all I feel is terror about when that falls apart, so I start crumbling, and that makes me look like the bad guy.
Because look what a good guy he is. Look how hard he's working. Look, he wants to be around his kids.
I feel crazy right now because he's doing all this "good" stuff. And that's actually harder than when things are actually bad.
He's not. I told him the truth - that I believed the ONLY thing that would help was this program. But doing it doesn't earn him a marriage.
I need to fight these internalized beliefs about how my husband is "earning" something right now. That's really what makes me feel trapped.
@StaceyLRicks Awww! Happy birthday to her! Super PI day to her today. :) :)
But I think choice matters. Bearing the "unbearable" as a choice that *I* make is different than bearing it because I feel I have no choice.
That is unbearable. I'm good at bearing the unbearable. It's an important part of how I've gotten as mentally healthy as I am.
I don't trust him. He doesn't deserve trust, and trust is a bad idea. But he has control/influence over almost every aspect of my life.
I still feel like a hostage to his behavior. I still feel like he's the one who always gets to be behind the wheel of everything.
I don't know how to function. I hate living like this.
He went to therapy last night. Going again on Wednesday. And I'm breaking down waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I need to leave. I need to leave. I genuinely feel like I'm holding my breath, waiting for I don't know what.
Which *would* be awesome, but since my first daughter took 28 hours to be born, I think that ship has perhaps sailed for my sis already.
My sister is joking about going into labor today and having her baby have a Pi Day birthday.
Ok. I don't like deleting tweets, but that story just was way too much "poor white lady" for a story related to racism. I took it down.
@Layogenic I am okay with either of those labels. Absolutely. Ugh.
@Layogenic True, true. Right now, though, full of rage at bottom feeders who feed on the fear created by abuse to ALSO prey.
The older I get, the more I *loathe* the "well, they should have known better" defense for "respectable" fleecing. So much rage.
Also, wow, I feel like an idiot. And that feeling of shame associated with feeling like a sucker. What a gut punch.
I'm not going to explain the context for this right now, but dang I just realized again how vulnerable victims are to exploitation.
@Layogenic Hahahaha. &lt;3
@nothingsmonstrd Neither of us speak another language. It very much feels like sending her out into an ocean we will never know sometimes.
@nothingsmonstrd This is such a striking image - husband and I have out our 4 year old in a French immersion preschool.
They told me today that she's gone back to napping at preschool. She's always annoyed when she wakes up, thinking she's missed something.
My 4 year old just put her head down while coloring and fell asleep. Not sick.
Anyway - money fixes a lot of things. If I had money of my own, I'd do some things differently. 5/5
Because I'm tired of not knowing. I'm SO tired of hearing "that's a question for a lawyer" when I want to know a realistic answer. 4/
I would sit in that person's office and rack up charges while I asked them about *all* the angles, about everything my husband could do. 3/
The thing I would immediately do is hire a divorce lawyer. Not necessarily move out, but immediately I would have a lawyer. 2/
That LRT reminded me that I realized recently that if I found out we won this Monopoly sweepstakes at the grocery store, 1/
@EmilysHollow Sounds nice!
Aaaaaand ~~curtains~~.
@mylifeasprose Hey! ::sends extra kisses your way:: ::princess waves as I sashay to bed:: ;)
@mazzie Special kisses for you! &lt;3 &lt;3 :)
::remembers this is Twitter and I don't have to clean up the broken lamp:: Hooray!!
::bumps wall bc I'm not looking:: I'm ok, I'm ok! ::resumes blowing kisses with both hands:: ::knocks over a lamp::
Oh! There's no school tomorrow! Why am I making a lunch? Off to bed for me. ::blows kisses while dashing away::
@OhDianeMarie @mazzie I am sober. Just FYI.
@OhDianeMarie @mazzie You all have to imagine me doubled over in uncontrollable laughter after I tweeted that to get the full effect.
@mazzie @OhDianeMarie ::pops in:: ~~I'm~~ interesting. Wokka wokka!
I'm going to bed soon, but seriously, y'all are ~~wonderful~~.
The things I discover now that we have Hulu Plus.
Oh, wow. I've been ignoring Chris Hardwick for so long I had no idea he's had this show @/midnight for over a year??
All right, watching The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore for the first time, and it was cool, but this panel discussion on "word police" ....
@OhDianeMarie @missbonnieblu ::runs away laughing::
@OhDianeMarie @missbonnieblu *wanders by and wipes snot on you so you feel at home*
@mazzie @stuckinspincycl @OhDianeMarie @peacefultaru 
@femme_esq @_L1vY_ Thank you. Twitter has been *huge* the last few years for giving me language/support to push back. So thank you!!
@mazzie You know, I feel like the next step in this progression is slinging poo......
@mazzie oo oo eeee eee!! ::scratches under armpits:: :D
Anyway, to conclude, that's my favorite kind of laughter. Which is kind of the ultimate in-joke, I suppose? Which is why I'm not a comedian?
@mazzie *sticks tongue out at you*
@mazzie You're talking about TV that I don't watch, but I'm waving hi to you anyway. *waves with a silly grin*
@_L1vY_ Oh, I'm remembering @femme_esq, about how women didn't have the right to say yes (which is the other side of this coin).
@_L1vY_ I remember something recently, but it wasn't @sassycrass (who is brilliant and could very well have said something similar).
@ArgRipper @LeahNTorres *I* wanted kids. They used the fear of *not* having them to steer me away from the IUD. Multiple times.
In a lot of ways, that's the only reason I'm tweeting this, bc I don't know if I'm making any sense.
That laughter was the payoff for *years* of pain (physical and emotional), misery, fear, and struggle. Wish I could bottle that.
The idea that I could just be, "No, fuck you, not right now," and be ~~unbothered~~. Sheer beauty.
That "fuck you" in the middle, especially.
And I just laughed and laughed and laughed.
I could say that, WITHOUT SHAME. And MEAN IT.
And it hit me, that yes, I really could just say that, and it REALLY WAS OK. 

IT WOULD BE OK.
...You can ask. Great! And sometimes I'll say yes. And sometimes I'll say - 'No, fuck you, I just want to get in the shower.'"
"Look, I just don't want it to be a big deal. ...
Today, he made some comment about "I'm trying, but I don't want to make you angry..." and I just threw my hands up at him and said -
He has tried. I still get irritated, bc it often feels like he is trying to say the magic words to make the sex vending machine - me - work.
Tried to tell my husband to just back off when I say no, not push it or ask "why???"
I've pushed back on that a LOT. Focused on saying no. Focused on saying yes only when I want to.
All of which doesn't sound right, bc it's never that blatant. That's the subtext that never makes it to the surface.
Saying no is bad bc I "should" want to be with my husband. Don't I love him? Don't I want him to be happy? Don't I find him attractive?
I can, but I *shouldn't.* Why I shouldn't is pretty much left unsaid - it didn't need to be said for years. Saying no was just bad.
If you ask my husband about that, he'll say "of course" I have a choice. "Of course" I can say no.
My marriage has longstanding issues wrt sex. Basically, I have felt that I ought to say yes, &amp; need a "good reason" to say no.
Ok, I'm going to tell you something that happened today re: humor. TW: sex, abuse, profanity...
@LeahNTorres I could have prob talked them into it, but the tone felt very much "if there are problems, &amp; you want kids, you'll regret it."
@LeahNTorres *Every* time I asked about the IUD before kids, I got hedging about "we don't like doing it bc risks" that scared me off.
@kateiscrafty His whole framing missed the fact that it *wasn't* a wake up call for many people, it just was for *him.* 2/2
@kateiscrafty My main point stands whether you interpret it literally or as "shining a spotlight." 1/
@glassblowerscat Although, I am not sure if the jokes I'm imagining would be accessible to *anybody.* :p
@glassblowerscat Exactly.
@glassblowerscat So, yeah, the opposite of mainstream. :P
And I guess he would argue I shouldn't be outraged at him (see #1), but you know, why does he get to decide that?
@glassblowerscat But it would be unbearable if done wrong, bc you'd just be mocking victims.
@glassblowerscat There's a humor that works between paramedics, or doctors. A sort of inside set of jokes. Kind of like that.
@glassblowerscat I've thought about it more. What I really crave is a kind of gallows humor, playing on the absurdities of abuse.
It just feels insulting to people who live that every day, who never got to have "scabs."
I'm objecting to the framing of that whole paragraph, which implies that bc depression now matters to him, now it's an issue that matters.
@kateiscrafty Didn't mean what literally?
It would be different if he said "It finally hit me last year, I know a lot of people figured this out before I did, I'm sorry."
And to declare that bc something was a wake up call for YOU, that it's a wake up call for everybody.
Just, fuck you, dude, that it took until 2014 and the loss of someone in your field to figure out depression was "real."
This is just me, personally, but it's the part that crystallized it for me. (TW: suicide, Robin Williams) 
(TW: suicide) Two, which sort of follows on from one, fuck him for his comment on Robin Williams.
I understand his point, &amp; respect it as a personal choice for himself. But to tell other people, who are at much more risk, how to react?
First, I really think his argument that "we" should be "mocking" and pitying instead of outraged is a really privileged position.
I'm just going to say two things. I'm sure other people will have said it better.
Ok, I admit it. It's hard not to be pissed at Patton Oswalt right now.
Wouldn't that be a kick, if I actually figured out how to be funny?
I actually would love to figure out how to write humor that applied to my situation, that was compassionate to people like me.
@Knitting_Kninja @Katie_Speak I LOVE Kipper. I think it's back on Netflix.
@danileekelley *hugs*
@mkhajdin :( That would make me feel pretty crazy.
@mkhajdin Losing your version of him that wasn't asshole sucks, too.
@mkhajdin Gotcha. Dang. I'm anxious just thinking about being in that position. :(
@mkhajdin I will cross my fingers for you.
@mkhajdin Ugh. I'm sorry. I was hoping you could make a clean break since it sounded like an online relationship. :(
@mkhajdin Is the coat the only thing keeping you in contact with him, at this point?
@mkhajdin That fear is terrible. I'm sorry.
@mkhajdin I really am sorry. Does he have any more of your things?
@mkhajdin I'm so sorry. :(
@saalon I cherish your confidence in me. :)
I guess that's the point. I try to focus on kindness and truth for myself. I'm just talking here. Oh, hello, who are all you people again?
I add to the last RT to try to tweet with kindness and your best attempt at truth even if nobody is following you.
Blog like nobody is clicking.
@saalon Thank you! Then it works in context. For some reason I thought Java was completely different. I wish I knew more actual code... :P
@saalon ok, I can't help myself. Are C++ and Java similar enough that it's believable that Claudia would confuse them?
@TexasBobbi Sounds good to me. :) Congrats on the snazzy cut!
