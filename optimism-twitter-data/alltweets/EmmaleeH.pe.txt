@_saaaaarah and I got out earlier than I did with the SAT
@_saaaaarah the math is easier too!
@ThatsG_ thank you!!
@_saaaaarah and I've now taken both &amp; I love the ACT better
@_saaaaarah actually easy except science. But you also don't get points off for wrong answers so it's ultimately easier than the SAT
I look like shit &amp; everyone here looks so nice like guys .. You'll be here for 4-5 hours. you can look like shit it's ok
Really don't feel like taking this test ha
I can't wait to go jet skiing this afternoon <WATER WAVE>
I'm not ready for this ACT
It shouldn't be allowed by law to be up at 5 am
That was honestly the worst thing anything could have said.
@Greg2Tuff someone who thinks you're an asshole
@Greg2Tuff this is actually rude
I don't do well with compliments
Lol love these weeks where I just want to cry all the time
Having 3 parents yell at you really sucks
I'm so fucking done

Thanks for just ruining my self esteem mom. Thanks for crushing it like you've always done.
I'm going to be a much better mother than you are to me, just watch
"You have the power to do better" well maybe if you were home &amp; actually cared about me then I wouldn't have to go through this by myself
Love love having my mom disappointed in me
I just want to homeschool
I want to see if I can run tomorrow ..
Tonight felt great to let every emotion go
A little girl named Emily thinks I'm a princess and she's so cute
Today went from great to worse in a matter of just a few hours
Can't wait to have my parents come home this weekend and tell me how I could have done better
And I know I disappointed my parents
I'm so disappointed in myself
I tried to be happy today but you shot that down like a bird in the sky ms. Maddox

Try to keeping me from my dad &amp; see what happens because I'd be happy to leave you since you don't even care about me
He's family too. Not just your family. Sorry sweetie but he's the father of your child. He shares custody of me so you can fuck off.

@__Odizzle how could you
@__Odizzle THIS IS UGLY
@__Odizzle WHY YOURE AN ASS
Living in Florida sucks so much
All I want to do is sleep every emotion away
I don't even know why I'm still feeling this way
I probably won't get any sleep tonight :///
If I already told you multiple times I don't want you the please do not try to hit on me. I do not like you. Get that through your head.
A WHOLE NEW WORLD JUST CAME ON OMG SO HAPPY
I hate/love sad songs
All I want to do is sleep but I can't
You call the shots babe, I just wanna be yours
I doubt myself everyday
I think I might just sleep
Kinda hope it's worth it
"I can tell you're short" thanks Lex....
If my immune system could not be super weak that'd be great
"Ew you're so ugly" THANKS DAISY
I don't want to become an adult for the fact that I can't wear super cute clothes when I'm 40 &amp;&amp; because of how expensive it is
I feel very jittery <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
I hate this
I feel like some straight shit
Lol I work a double today &amp; I've only gotten 4 hours of sleep
Late deep night conversations are always my favorite <TWO HEARTS>
"never growing out of this"
I get very sappy and cute when it's late at night
