In the library, sleepy af &amp; got 35 mins until I meet with my group but look what I found! No sleep for me <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
Just left my counseling session and I'm so glad that I went cuz I got so much off my chest about the fuckery that's happened this week.
I'm so sleepy OMG. Omw to counseling and I'm falling asleep on this bus. Lord please.
These mini naps that I took today just made even sleepier!! I took at 7 minute nap before I left the house <DIZZY FACE><DIZZY FACE><DIZZY FACE> I am dead.
Sleepy af and hungry af. Never a good combo.
I'm so sleepy, I almost fell asleep in this center lord have mercy <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>.
I know I look like death right now. I'm running off of 3 hours of sleep and the only thing I've eaten is some granola bars.
All this damn construction that they doing on Railroad ave tho <PENSIVE FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
That final I just took..... Bruh lol. It was long as hell but I think I did okay. I should get a B.
It's gonna be a busy day and I'm tryna find out when I'm gonna have time to go to sleep lol
Surprisingly, I'm still thriving. I'm not that sleepy anymore and I got a lot of studying done. I'm gonna leave in like 35 mins.
Just woke up. I'm so sleepy and tired omg. This is gonna be hell.
I just FOUR alarms from 2am to 2:30am. Jesus, take the alarm clock.
I can't stay up for the rest of the night. Theres no way in hell. I'm gonna take a nap, wake up at 2 or 3am &amp; study until the final at 7:30
My final is at 7:30am. Last semester, I had final at this same time and I didn't go to sleep smh
I reeeeally don't think that I'm gonna go to sleep tonight <PENSIVE FACE>
Our final exam was supposed to begin over 20 mins ago. Where the hell is this guy?! Smh.
Just found out my last exam grade for black psy and I got a high D <CONFOUNDED FACE>. This class is the death of me goodness fucking gracious.
Omw to campus to hopefully catch the prof I missed yesterday also study for my final exam that's at 3pm.
I'm studying and listening to nothing but late 90s/early 2000s pop boy band music from Nsync to BSB to O town. Even Aaron Carter lol smh
Todays been nothing short of "Go fuck yourself". Shitty news about my graduation plans, rainy weather, and finals week = severe hell.
Those ladies hair in my LRT look gorgeous omg!
I got so much 2 do today <CRYING FACE>. Omw to talk to my advisor, gotta volunteer later on, meet wit my group, then study for the rest of the night <UNAMUSED FACE>
We will NEVER be able to eliminate racism but WE can change our CJ system. Focus on that! Fuck the fact that these cops are usually white.
I unfollow anybody who brings race into these police shooting situations. Don't worry about what color they are/beliefs!
Our method of being keyboard warriors &amp; watching the news cuz of ONE city is not working! Idk how we let ourselves be distracted like this!
While we all on social media tryna be heard, our ppl are still being killed by officers AND other black ppl. So what are we doing wrong?
While all yall fussing so much about Baltimore, I've heard of TWO other murders of young Black men last week in Florida.
I must've unfollowed 10 people within the last 48 hrs. I can't stand when these police murders make headlines. Yall do the fucking most.
The rest of my entire night is gonna be reading. I got six articles to read and I gotta study. Hopefully these articles aren't too boring <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
Got back in 35 mins just like I said and I didn't get rained on!!!!! God looked out on that one cuz I was trying it.
I'm omw to get something to eat and I forgot my umbrella <UNAMUSED FACE>. I really hope that it doesn't rain till I get home! All I need is like 35 mins.
Was gonna take a 2 hour nap and wake up at 5pm. SMH. I just woke up 10 mins ago. I need to get on it tonight, I got a lot of reading to do!
I'm gonna try to donate today. Idk why I keep trying with that place. Oh yeah cuz I'm broke af.
I can't deal with these professors today man.
Then I went to my advisors office, the 1 I been looking for for over 2 weeks, and she was actually there but said she was just leaving <PENSIVE FACE>.
No, I literally almost fell asleep on his couch <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I almost fell asleep in a prof's office while waiting for him to get to me and it took forever cuz he wouldn't STFU.
At 9am, I spent an hour taking a confusing ass survey for EC
This morning tho <PENSIVE FACE>
The weed not holding you over for not even 24 hrs? If so, then what's the point? It's like a waste of money then lol smh
I wud hate to be dependent on something. If u gotta smoke weed that often then wtf is it doing 4 you? Like, does it wear off that fast?
This is the 4th time that my roommate and her pothead ass friends have smoked in the last 30 hours. It's like they dependent or sum shit smh
I been reading for my test on Wednesday all day so I'm taking a two and a half hour break to do whatever.
@_Lexonce I need to but I won't/don't cuz she always gets defensive smh <PENSIVE FACE>
Idk wth they're smoking but it smells horrible. That ain't no regular weed. I hate when she have ppl over cuz she be doing the most smh.
Finished my homework. Im tryna relax for a minute before I start studying but my roommate and her friend wont shut up. &amp; her laughing omg <PENSIVE FACE>
So happy I got some chill time last night with the bff. Also got a lot of peace and quiet! It was well needed. Now, its back to school work.

@seventhundersx I knew it was either sleep of video games lol. When r u free to Skype? I miss you like a hooker misses the corner <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Im SO enjoying this peace &amp; quiet rn. Aint had this in a week cuz I was drowned in schoolwork. Well, I still am but Im close to the shore <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I grew up in a house full of girls. I really hope this new roommate just has a deep voice lol
Im actually kinda excited to finally get our third roommate but if it's a guy then that's gonna be something that I'll have to get used to.
2nd, I got a new roommate today. I think its a guy <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> lol. I havent seen him/her yet but I heard them moving in &amp; it sounded like a dude <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
2days been a really good day. 1st off, I got accepted as an intern! This all happened so fast lol but I'm glad I got it outta the way!
@seventhundersx hey girl. I FINA-FREAKING-LY have SOME time 2 chill out. Only thing I have left is 2 exams/group project later on next week!
I really feel like talking to my grandmother. I'm gonna call her since I have some time before my interview.
Omw to my internship interview. I'm trying not to make it a big deal cuz when I do that, I overanalyze and panic. #Ibedoingthemost
Today is gonna be kinda busy.
Good morning. On campus an hour early so I can participate in this "survey marathon" thingy to earn some extra credit points for black psy.
Today started off great, then it got greater, then it got super crappy. Sigh. Whatever. I'm just looking forward to tomorrow.
Made it to the center at 5:29. Literally lol smh. There's more ppl in here than I expected <PENSIVE FACE>. Hopefully it won't be too long.
I know it's rush hour but dang.
These damn red lights!!! <CRYING FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE>
Omg. We were just at a red light for over two minutes. And ppl wanna get off at every single stop. I really cannot deal smh
I really hope I make it there before 5:30pm. If I don't, then I've wasted my time coming all the way over here smh.
Tryna go donate but im worried cuz they stop taking donors in like 20 mins &amp; this bus took its sweet ass time to leave the terminal! ugh!
It feels like <DIZZY FACE><TIRED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE> outside.
*rereads tweets* my bad lol I meant TOMORROW at 2pm. Duh lol
I didnt even ask to have an internship in a public defenders office man wtf lol. Im grateful but Im kinda nervous. Idk what this may entail.
Met wit the internship prof &amp; he gave me a public defenders #. Called him &amp; I got an interview at 2pm <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FLUSHED FACE>. Idk it was gon be that fast damn
All I need is the freaking code for the internship class....like, damn <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm gonna try to go to the REAL advisors today. Hopefully Dr. Brown or Mr. Hunt will help me cuz my appointed advisor is MIA smh.
Yesterday, I waited for my "advisor" for an hour! But her ass never came to her office hours! This the 2nd time.  I'm so done with her ass.
I'm still so proud of myself for completing that methodology last night. That was a job and a half but it was still kinda fun.
However, this feeling is only gonna last for today cuz I gotta do some research on a theorist for my OTHER group tonight lol smh
Good morning! It feels so good to wake up and not have a test to take or an assignment due! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I swear the hardest part was those 3 hours that it took me to collect the results from all 50 surveys <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That really wasn't that bad since all I was doing was writing about the results of our surveys. I didn't have to come up with anything.
Just finised my methodology! Finally! It was supposed to be 3 pages but I did 5 just in case.
Took a long break to eat but I got and a half pages so far!
Nevermind. my roommate is in the kitchen and I dont feel like seeing her. or anyone for that matter.
bout to take another break cuz I'm hungry as hell.
Done with the first page. That wasn't hard at all.
My roommate has the loudest, high pitched, most annoying ass laugh I could ever imagine <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL>
This methodology is gonna be completely done b4 I go 2 sleep. No, if, and, or buts. I know I can do it. I think, as usual, I'm over thinking
3 pgs of "idk how to do this shit" lol. I found sum examples but they all differ. How the hell am I supposed 2 know which is right?
Took a 45 minute break. Now, its time to actually write -___-. Like I said earlier, Idk how to write a damn methodology. Sigh.
It was actually kinda fun to see the answers to the surveys tho. Its interesting to see how ppl think about our topic, hazing.
Just finished collecting/separating/recording the data frm these 50 surveys. Didnt kno it was gon take me that long. almost 3 fucking hrs <PENSIVE FACE>
Of course, this is gonna take me all night. Idek where to start. I'm gonna have to research first which is only gonna take up more time smh.
Now, I gotta go home and write a methodology....I've never done one before and I have to have it to my group by tomorrow <PENSIVE FACE>
Done with my last test for THIS week!!!! I think I did pretty good. As usual, I got stuck at the end but I know I got at least a B.
Waiting on my advisor to come to her office hours. She was supposed to be here almost 20 mins ago <POUTING FACE> I'm sick of her shit!
I got two hours until my next exam. But really, I only have an hour and a half to actually study cuz I gotta go see my advisor before class
Just found the exam schedule and the final for this class is on Thursday. <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> thank you.
By the grace of God, the exam is not today, it's sometime next week!! *wipes sweat off of forehead*
I'm supposed to read like six articles for the next exam and I have not read one sentence smh. I been too busy with my other classes <CONFOUNDED FACE>
I didnt even know if it was 2day so I was walking 2 class shitting bricks! But when I got here, no 1 was studying so I dont think its 2day.
I have a confession to make: pertaining to my class that's about to start right now, I have absolutely no idea when our next test is <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY><SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>.
I still know that I did really good. Not as good as I was going for but I know I got a high B on it. I can live with that.
Just took an exam like 30 mins ago and I'm kinda pissed off cuz it was like two questions on there that I had never seen before <PENSIVE FACE>.
I actually made it to an hour! With that being done, I'm sleepy af so good fucking night.
If I can stay up and study for just one more hour, I think I'll be ok. one more hour :/
I'm just gonna lay down in bed and study until I fall asleep. This test is later on tomorrow so I have more time to study anyways.
So, I'm done studying for my first test and its time to study for my second one but I'm so sleepy!!! and its not even midnight. ugh!
I'm determined to do well on these TWO tests tomorrow!
Been studying ALL night and I literally just realized that I missed #TheFlash tonight -____-.
Was 10 mins late to volunteering cuz I overslept. Good thing they don't care! I'm still sleep af tho <WEARY FACE>
Just finished my test about 30 mins ago. *sigh* as usual, idk how that went BUT I did get 7 extra credit points for free!
Idk how the hell she gonna fix this cuz no matter how she switches us, its always be an extra person in one of the groups. Its inevitable.
Its a mix up b/w my group &amp; another group. we all like "its just 1 more person" and she like "no! Groups are supposed to be only 7 ppl" smh.
On top of that, the prof somehow messed up what person goes wit what group so now our group may change cuz there's 2 many ppl in a group <UNAMUSED FACE>.
All the professor did was check to see who was there and dismissed class. This is over an hour of my life that I'll never get back <POUTING FACE>!
Today, if all members of your group showed up, you'd get Extra Credit. Only 2 outta 7 ppl from my group showed up SMH. Wasted my damn time!
I was gonna go donate today but I'm sleepy and tired as hell. Idk if I'm still gonna go or not.
Im so sleepy omg. Almost fell asleep on the freakin bus and now Im bout to doze off in class. Me waking up an hour early is throwing me off.
Omw home but only for like an hour. I need to charge my phone before class!
So, I wanna intern w FDLE &amp; 2day, I talked to a professor about it and I just saw a FDLE police car for the 1st time. Those are signs <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>.
I totally missed class smh but at least I got the info I needed for my internship!
Omg that professor would not STFU. I spoke with him for 45 mins and only like 15 mins of that convo was what I came in there for!
Skipped a good chunk of class to come to a professors office hours. There's two ppl in front of me and all he wanna do is fucking talk SMH.
I honestly don't know how I'm gonna juggle these 3 exams within these next two days. I'm trying tho
This driver need to hurry up cuz I gotta put all of these pages into these plastic covers <PENSIVE FACE> before 10:10am.
Good morning y'all. Woke up an hour earlier to come to campus and print out my work for my portfolio that's due today.
"The biggest mistake we make as individuals is thinking that everyone lives by the same principles."
Listening to the 8701 album (my fave from Usher) while I read this boring, over analyzed, reverse racist shit.

"Is a pigs pussy pork?"
Bill Withers is that dude! Such a phenomenal writer.
@seventhundersx bout to sign in
@seventhundersx Just got home!
It don't even feel like Friday. This week went by super fast.
Omw home from a group meeting. That was actually pretty fun.
@seventhundersx hellur. I just got done meeting with a class group but Im omw home now. Didn't we say #TheFlash tonight?
I really wasted my time by coming to class.
Wtf I'm the only person on the bus lol. Where everybody at this week? Schools almost over!
I should and want to follow more ppl. But I always end up blocking like 85% of them. Ppl, especially my age, get on my damn nerves.
Mmkay <PENSIVE FACE>RT @necolebitchie: Chris Brown Reveals Fatherhood Is Changing His Mentality 
Left class early 2 go 2 a professors office hours &amp; I SWEAR I heard this bitch in that room but she didn't answer the door. I knocked twice!
Its so damn hard not having parents to help you out. Sometimes I feel like I live "the college struggle 2.0: the extended version".
Am I up here to get good grades &amp;  receive a college degree? Or am I up here to say "fuck school" &amp; devote all of my time to finding a job?
A fam member just asked me "when the last time u applied 4 a job?". Um Like 2 weeks ago b4 I got drowned in exams, group projects &amp; finals!
I am so tired of my family acting like finding a job is as simple as finding titties in a strip club. #easytotalkshitwhenyoualreadyemployed!
This crappy ass service tho <UNAMUSED FACE>.
Good morning. Idk why my iPod be playing these crunk (yes I still use that word) songs so early in the damn morning smh.
Finally finished my career strategic plan! I was gonna also read a chapter tonight but I'm tired as hell. I'll do that tomorrow.
Not sure when I fell asleep but that was a pretty good nap.
Finally home! Gonna relax for a bit then get started on my homework
Finally on my way home! After like 12 hours if ripping and running all day. Lord.
I cant believe some ppl actually do this shit every day. Whatever my career will be, ima make sure i dont have to work up so damn early.
I can't believe I been up since 6am -___-.
I forgot all about these bandages on my arms, I could've taken them off an hour ago. Ur supposed to keep them on for 5 hours and its been 6.
this hour is going by slow as hell.
I have an appointment at 4pm on campus and it aint no sense in going back home so ima go to the library.
Ain't nothing like a free meal, I tell ya.
Cake cake cake cake!!!! Publix cake at that!
Its funny to go from being surrounded by ppl your age all day (school) to being in a room full of old white women <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I expected it 2b diverse &amp; Im the only young person in here. Am I really da only library volunteer in Leon county whos not a senior citizen?
So I just got to this volunteer recognition luncheon &amp; Im shocked AF. All the other volunteers are old white women, the opposite of me <FLUSHED FACE>.
I was only like 15 ft away but couldnt take it. I kept looking behind me 2 make sure it was ok. I already knew I was a phoneaholic but damn.
My professor made everybody move closer in class and I had to leave my phone so it could charge. I was legit losing my mind. That was death.
Now, idk how my grade gon be cuz this professor grades and makes tests with 3 sticks up his ass smh.
Just printed out my paper for my class at 11. I'm proud of myself, I think this is 1 of the best papers I've ever written in college.
That's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back <UNAMUSED FACE>
Welp. That appointment didn't go good at fucking all smh.
God is on my side today, the bus I needed came literally less than 30 secs after we got to the terminal! And we already leaving <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Na na na after you back it up and stop....
U know what...why my iPod decide to play "back that ass up" at 7 o'clock in the morning? Its 2 early 4 this shit but Im still listening <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
Good morning. Been up since 6:15am <PENSIVE FACE><CONFOUNDED FACE>.
@seventhundersx lmao!!
@seventhundersx ol lucky ass lol. Im still tryna unclog my toilet -___- im just gonna log in right now
@seventhundersx my damn toilet is clogging up so I cant even start yet wtf you gotta gimme a min
@seventhundersx Im all set to go but I have to go use the bathroom first and this may take a while <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@seventhundersx Yes. school is kicking my fucking ass. Its only a week and a half left. Sorry I forgot about Skype :/ but Im free tho!
@seventhundersx No, I had totally forgot that we were gonna Skype. I'm over here losing my fucking mind.
@seventhundersx Skype? Tonight? 
3pm on the dot, 13 mins before I leave for class and it starts to pour down rain again.
Its raining LIKE SHIT. I got class in an hour and a half. Best believe if its still raining, I will be keeping my dry ass in my house.
Just got done with my citations, not I gotta think of a title for my paper. This aint gonna be easy -__-
It better not be raining like that right now cuz I'm about to get off the bus.
Im standing there in the rain &amp; I see the bus coming from like 200 feet away lol. I knew the driver could see me getting soaked. #awkward
Decided to skip my next class so I can go home and revise my paper and my ass get caught in the rain!
Good morning <PENSIVE FACE>. Omw to my class thats been canceled for a week. Now I gotta wake up all early and shit smh.
Im tryna remember when I started working on the paper tonight. I think it was like around 8 or 8:30pm so its been a few hours.
Only thing left to do is revision, references, and a title page which im gonna do tomorrow cuz im too damn tired.
FINALLY done with my paper!!!! I got 7 pages of my life story and African centered theories lol.
only two more time periods to write about, my conclusion and then I'll be done!
I'm gonna finish this paper tonight, I can feel it!
Im straight kicking this papers ass. Whether or not I get a good grade, I know that I put my heart into it. Im legit telling my life story.
Chilling out before volunteering at 3pm. Then gonna get 2 work after I come back. If I stay off of YouTube, I can finish this paper tonight.
Im so damn short &amp; Im reminded of it every time I have 2 fuckin CLIMB 2 get on a bus. These drivers reeeally dont like lowering the bus huh.
I know myself all too well lol. Like I said last night, I was totally over thinking that paper. It's actually pretty fun to write it!
Speaking of my paper, I wrote almost 3 pages last night! It has to be 4-7 pages. The way that I'm writing, I may make it to like 6 pages.
Instead of sitting here in class being lectured (yelled) at, I could be home finishing up my paper.
Omw to class. I was actually gonna go to class on time today but I got caught up on this morning. *Kanye shrug*
Top of the morning ta ya <TOP HAT>!
First page of my paper done! I need to stop over thinking tho. I'm critiquing every damn sentence smh.
I only have one class tomorrow at 11:15am so I can stay up to like 4:30am at the latest. I got plenty of time to finish this HW.
YouTube sidetracked the fuck outta me tonight. BUT Im still doing my homework! Its just taking me like 4 hours longer than it would have lol
@TheColIegeLife This is the most shallow shit you guys have ever posted.
I'm so hungry. Good thing I'm almost home. All I had to eat today was a granola bar.
This bus driver is the same one that was driving the A bus and I said that he looks younger than me lol. He looks like a legit 11th grader.
I always over think/analyze things. At least that's what ppl tell me lol. Maybe that's what I'm doing with this paper.
I really hope Im not underestimating that paper. Its a paper on my life &amp; I have use a black theorists theory on how it affects my life.
My goal for tonight is to finish my career strategic plan and do at least two pages of my paper that's due on Thursday.
Finished my test and as usual, idk how the hell I did. I really don't care, I got too much homework to finish to wonder.
In other words, the album is fucking amazing. Only 2 or 3 songs that I can take or leave outta 18. That's really uncommon!
&amp; finally, 18. "Burning bridges": idk who Jason aldean is but he was great! This song made me feel some typa way<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>. Really cute &amp; touching.
17. "In my life": Moment of silence 4 those damn horns! Fucking Amazing. Love it! John legend was the perfect feature. Luda was <BOMB> as usual.
16. "Problems": LOVE!! Cee lo sounds great , beat is crazy and Luda spoke some truth. I can relate to that song forreal. One of my faves!
15. "Money": its featuring Rick Ross and sounds TOO MUCH like a Rick Ross song. I don't like Rick's music so there you have it lol.
14. "This has been my world": I don't remember it but, with me, that's not a bad thing. I gotta listen again! It may be hot.
13. "Charge it to the rap game": love it! I luv musicians who fire back at haters thru their music, thats wat this song is! Lyrics are bomb.
Okay! Back to what I was doing...
Gotta take a break, gotta walk to the other side of campus.
My bad. The song is actually called "NOT long". It don't matter, it still sucks lol.
I love Usher so much, thats why it hurts me to say how horrible that song is. Luda was okay in the song but Usher just fucked it all up smh.
12. "How long": any1 who know me know how much I stan 4 Usher. But this song sucks ass! Usher killed the song<POUTING FACE><PENSIVE FACE> def the worst on the album
11. "Ocean skies": TBCH I cant take sad ass songs like that anymore. Dont got 2 time 4 the emotions. &amp; Monicas voice was <THUMBS DOWN SIGN> in this song <DISAPPOINTED FACE>.
10. "Good lovin": love it! Def one of the best on the album. A good song for men to relate to, which is uncommon. Miguel's voice is <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><OK HAND SIGN>.
9. "Come and see me": I wasn't feeling K.R.I.T's verse. Love Ludas lyrics tho!
7. "Get lit": "ayyye!" was my 1st reaction. 1 of my faves. Beat is hot too. 8. "Come &amp; see me (interlude)": I honestly dont remember it lol!
5. "Beast mode": take it or leave it. Im 2 soft 4 that lol. 6. "Viagra (skit)": LOL. Classic comical Luda. Glad he put it on the album!
3. "Call ya bluff": was corny at 1st but it grew on me! I like the chorus. 4. "Lyrical healing": too damn short smh but I love the lyrics.
2. "Grass is always greener": def my fave! It describes the hell outta me. Im so indecisive, i can relate so much lol! Beat &amp; flow was hot.
1. "Ludaversal (intro)": he went HAM, ima learn that whole rap before April is over lol. This let ppl know that hes still a beast.
I'm gonna so something I used to do all the time before I switched Twitter accounts: review the album song by song.
I know and love all his singles but never took time to listen to any of his albums. I been missing out!
Ludaversal is all I been listening to since Saturday. I think it made me a Luda fan. I guess I been sleeping on his music!
I also have to go see a professor to talk about/hopefully sign up for my internship!
Gotta stay on campus so I can study.
Good morning! Omw to class. Gotta stay on campus all day cuz of my test at 3:35pm <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>.
Just called them and they about 15 mins from home.
I'm just waking up. My uncle and grandma dropped me off back home after golden corral and I been sleep ever since! I was knocked tf out lol
Good morning y'all! At golden corral with the grandma and uncle!!
"You protesters at my concert, y'all make me sick. I thought I told you I would never disrespect a bitch." <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Listening to Ludacris' new album and this pretty damn good.
Thank God for this smooth and quick bus connection! The A bus got to the terminal and here come the B bus 30 seconds later <OK HAND SIGN>.
I left my grandma at the house this morning and I kinda feel bad about it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Donation went great, I was in there for less than an hour which unusual as hell for a Saturday! Im just happy I got my light bill money! Lol
Came to the donation center and its literally no one in here lol. About 6 or 7 came in at the same time so I still wound up up waiting tho
Good morning! Omw to go try to donate. I better not get deferred cuz Lord knows I need the money.
I'm just gettin started
9:45pm and my grandma is already asleep <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I havent even eaten the bbq yet. Now, Im tryna decide if I want bbq or pizza 4 dinner! Usually I gotta FIND something 2 eat! This is heaven!
I gotta say it was a good day! My uncle hooked up with some bbq then he got us 2 free pizzas frm a party he went to! it was a DAMN good day!
Thank God for this beautiful breeze!!! This don't happen often in Tally.
Most of the big frat parties are always less than half of a mile from my house and I've never been to one lol. #notthepartytype #Itriedtwice
My uncle bought us some BBQ ribs and chicken <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMIRKING FACE>
My grandma's been at my house since like 11:30ish all by herself lol.
I was so caught up on my classes that I forgot to say my grandma and uncle are finally in town and we went to breakfast together!
This is two hours of walking up steep ass hills, sweat, heat, and confusion that I'll never get back <PENSIVE FACE>.
Found out the times 4 the conference sessions were changed. I guess my profs didnt kno cuz they both had all us students looking like fools!
my prof is nowhere to be found! I been here for 25 mins and I only see a few classmates! (2/2)
My second class did say that we're gonna meet at this same conference so I WALK BACK to the other side of campus for this conference (1/2)
go to a conference so I walk to THE OTHER SIDE OF CAMPUS and see no one. WALK BACK to class and no one still isn't there! (2/2)
What the hell is going on with my classes today??? Went to my first class and NO ONE was in there. I remembered the prof said we may (1/2)
The chicken is wasted cuz there's no way in hell I'm gonna eat anymore of that. That's what I get for trying something new smh.
Need to figure out what I'm gonna have for dinner. I made orange chicken last night but it was disgusting! All that chicken just wasted <DISAPPOINTED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
My grandma just left me a voicemail saying that she's gonna stay with her cousins in Havana tonight like wtf is that about?! Smh.
Idk what the hell me and my grandma gonna do for nearly 4 days. Ain't nothing to do here. We won't have a car. but whatever.
She's coming today I just don't know when. Some time this evening tho.
My grandma is coming to town and shes gonna stay with me till Sunday! Spent all last night getting the house ready for her.
Ain't been on here in a good minute. Gonna try to use this account again!
Well, hello to this side of my Twitterverse!
I just can't escape these purple shirts, camo shorts, and gold boots on campus <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Do you wanna be happy? Do you wanna be free?
Less than 24 hrs ago,, it was hot af &amp; now, its cold &amp; windy outside. #Florida #Bipolar #Floridaslikeaboxofchocolates #gottaguesstheweather
Ppl who drive and use they phone make me fucking sick. Don't give a shit about nobody, apparently, not even themselves.
Ayyye! #theonlyperkofValentinesDay #CheapAssCandy 
Damn, its dry on this side if Twitterville as well -___-. Y'all need to wake up! Its 10:30am.
Helllloo to this side of my Twitter world! Haven't been here in a minute. My other account was too dry this morning.
Good morning! Omw to my real home, good ol central Florida.
Sometimes I feel like ppl expect this  earth 2 just be a huge ball of no worries. No one ever promised us that. Who said life would be fair?
Back to school. Back to reality. Back to depression. Back to stress.
@retromutagen girl, I bet money that the professor won't even look it up! Ppl wont think for themselves.
Common fucking sense. You were born with it. Honor it. Cherish it. USE IT.
@retromutagen that's honestly why I don't fuck with people today. Too damn stupid! What's my motto? Common fucking sense!
Idk who this guy is in class and ima keep it that way.
The saddest part: he was serious and the entire class, including the professor, actually believed him. I just kept my mouth shut.
Morgan J. Freeman, a woman, is one of the executive producers on the show "16 &amp; Pregnant". What a Dumbass.
<UNAMUSED FACE><PENSIVE FACE> and every other blank stare emoji in existence.
Some people are so fucking stupid. To support his claim that Morgan Freeman is a pervert, he said that hes the director of "16 &amp; Pregnant".
I wanna say Happy B'day to my ace, my #1, my sugar pie honey bunch, my sister, my best friend (cont) 
@retromutagen Good thinking. I still have it too but idk wtf it is on my pc lol

@steelnstarlight Im sure there's some really nice ones in or by Orlando. Its pretty close to home.
@steelnstarlight eeexxxxacctly. I got super confused. U know u getting old when Twitter confuses you

@steelnstarlight wait, im confused as hell. Im mixing up my accts. I'll talk to u thru this one for rn.
@steelnstarlight forreal. Im on the bus rn and I was like "oh marys up, lemme message her." Did u get my messages I sent from my other acct?

All my food and the rest of my clothes is the goal for today
Im glad I got a day off of work, this whole day is gonna be devoted to packing! I think Im gonna up all my food today.
@steelnstarlight another motto: "Shit happens".
@steelnstarlight lmao I think its something you can't avoid in life
@steelnstarlight thats why I said "WANT" to help lol. Cleaning up any type of shit should humble anyone. Even babies and diapers
@steelnstarlight Lord have mercy. Thats true. Im glad that u actually WANT to help, cuz most ppl would take advantage of the way ur fam acts
@steelnstarlight there ya go, thats a great idea. I just feel bad cuz u wanna help but they wont let you. Like, wtf is up with that.
@steelnstarlight okaaaay but you could do it just as good as them one day if they actually let you practice. Smh.
@steelnstarlight dude.....its grass. Like, seriously.
Tallahassee gnats are the fxcking worst! They're just so bold, they get RIGHT in your face.
@steelnstarlight tell em to back up, you're a big girl

I rode 5 different buses today. And to think, some ppl do this on a daily basis. #Icantdeal
When I finally get home, im not even stepping foot outside until Friday.
This woman is eating pickled sausages on the bus. Like, how inconsiderate can ya be???
And here I am complaining about Tally's bus system. See how God teaches you? lol.
Was just speaking to this man and he told me that the bus comes every hour and a half in Fort Meyers.
Been out since 11am and still aint made it back home yet. Tallahassee's bus system is incredibly inconvenient.
Maaan. Today really aint alla that. At all.
Welp. Thats two hours of my life I'll never get back.
This bus was supposed to leave 23 min ago and the driver is just getting back on the bus -____-
Haven't been on the M bus in forever. Feels weird lol.
Her dress is just perf, uh. Prada color beige.
That was fun tho! I finally saw the U.S courthouse, the supreme court building and the capitol in person.
Just got done walkin all around downtown and I got a side cramp lol
@steelnstarlight word.
@steelnstarlight It really does. Just threw my whole body clock off! But Im gonna get it back on track tonight
I wanna visit the museum too.
I've lived in Tallahasse for nearly 3 years and have yet to really explore the city...if there's anything to explore lol
Decided that Im gonna go on an adventure tomorrow. Im gonna walk all around downtown and finally see whats over there.

Everytime I pass by this restaurant named Georgio's, theres not even one car in the parking lot. They must be closed lol.
And my nephew is going to middle school. Oh lord, take me now! I feel so old!
Today is the last day of school for my homes county. And my nieces graduate from pre-k today. I can't deal with this :(.
BTW, it is hot AF outside. All I did was walk down the street and my face was literally dripping sweat when I came back. Dear God, help us.
It is NOT my day. Missed the bus &amp; gotta wait another 45 min, then omw back home, stepped in a huge pile of gum and it ruined my shoe. Sigh.
@steelnstarlight *shakes head* okay...try it
@steelnstarlight *Deep sigh* I really want to...but you're making it really hard

@steelnstarlight I was damn near flat lined lol. But i wanna pick a movie that you havent seen yet. Have you seen John Q?
@steelnstarlight Yep, in your Jesus' room and I fell right asleep on his bed.
@steelnstarlight You know EXACTLY how I feel lol. That shit put me to sleep faster than history class lol let me stop.
Donny Hathaway is becoming one of my favorite voices of all time, slowly but surely.
@steelnstarlight My face when I saw "from the director of Saw": -___- lol BUT it looks good!
@steelnstarlight *goes to find trailer* Hmmm Im goin thru my options.
@steelnstarlight Never hear of it lol but It sounds hot. I gotta think of a drama
@steelnstarlight Damn, I just saw this. But I like what we did last time. Drama then horror
Your choices will ALWAYS have consequences. Whether it comes in a week or a decade.
Just because you can do whatever you want, doesn't mean you should.
@steelnstarlight Totally agree. Lets go head and choose them now. U know how we get
@steelnstarlight Oh, stop lmao. Are we still on for tomorrow? Im so bored, I cant wait
@steelnstarlight True lol. Thank God you thought of it tho. If not, we would have nvr figured it out
@steelnstarlight That candy crush was Unchecked lmao. sorry for wasting our time! 
@steelnstarlight No problemo. Ok try to send it again.
@steelnstarlight Lmao im on fb rn tryna check my settings
@steelnstarlight *guilty look* lol thats a reeeeally good point. I prob did block it cuz i hate when ppl send me stuff lol.
@steelnstarlight Just checked. Still nothing.
@steelnstarlight -____- Sigh. Im so confused
@steelnstarlight Hey, girl. I just did the candy crush thing but idk if I did it right tho
@steelnstarlight my bad, I meant sign in. Same difference. Lol.

@steelnstarlight *shakes head* nope.
@steelnstarlight okey dokey
@steelnstarlight I still haven't gotten it yet.
@steelnstarlight Ok send it to me then. Thats why I stopped playin them.
@steelnstarlight Of course, but I dont have candy crush. Do I download it on google play?
@steelnstarlight Only something you can do with your bff
@steelnstarlight Can you believe we spent all day replying to each other on twitter about a zoo.
@steelnstarlight lmao I was wondering why you were tweeting but not replying
@steelnstarlight 
@steelnstarlight Loooooong ass lines. We're gonna have to make a waiting list and reservations for entry into the zoo.
@steelnstarlight We should go head &amp; throw an ode 2 Thriller in there. Like a haunted spot with scary animals. This zoo is the legit shit.
@steelnstarlight I just got new ideas! We can have an actual circus n the zoo 2, like da album &amp; a huge venue 4 B'day parties, like da album
@steelnstarlight Girl, this zoo is gonna shit on I of A, Wet n wild, Sea world, Universal, Fun spot, Gator land, even Disney.
@steelnstarlight We should train the animals to dance (or at least bop) to each legends songs
@steelnstarlight That many replies aint nothin new for us lol
@steelnstarlight Most def. They gonna be fully trained.
@steelnstarlight Hell no. We aint got time for any law suits.
@steelnstarlight And we'll thow them a huge party. They get to spend quality time with the animals up close n personal
@steelnstarlight Exactly. Omg we should start a foundation where each year, a group of selected kids get in the zoo for free
@steelnstarlight That little shit *your voice*
@steelnstarlight so true. But we gotta make sure we give back. We dont need any bad karma.
@steelnstarlight We all make mistakes lol. Man, we would be set for life tho. Like, how creative is a music zoo?
@steelnstarlight All because of a damn copyright. all that hard work for nothing. Smh. But that wont happen cuz we 2 smart for that!
@steelnstarlight Then u wud go right back with ur parents and I would go back to my grandma.
@steelnstarlight Lmao, if we were business owners, you wud get copyrighted
@steelnstarlight Then when we stack enough cake, we can hire ppl to run the zoo and move wherever we want. The American dream lol
@steelnstarlight Florida's been good to us. It gave us a place to live lmao. Orlando is perfect and we'll still be close to our fam.
@steelnstarlight Lmao heeey. Every state got its cons but we gotta think about MONEY. Money-wise, FL is perfect. Its tourist galore here!
@steelnstarlight Forreal. What about the location tho?
@steelnstarlight Girl, im a visionary! lol. It really would! Do you realize how much money we're gonna be makin when we open this?!
@steelnstarlight Imagine this as a big ass aquarium. Its gonna be epic. Like a tourist attraction 
@steelnstarlight ahhhh! such a kick ass name. Omg and I want the wonder-quarium in the shape of the hotter than july album cover!
@steelnstarlight True teas. For Stevie's exhibit, Im thinking of a big ass aquarium. Idk why but I think itll be hot!
@steelnstarlight I got issues lol but I like it too! Keep thinking of other names tho cuz I wanna find the PERFECT one
@steelnstarlight Trust. No one will mind. hmmm. "zoosic"? "Lion, Tigers, and Legends"???
@steelnstarlight It really does. And it still bumps over 10 yrs later
@steelnstarlight I gotta add Stevie in there too, hes always been in my top 3 faves.
@steelnstarlight Michael gotta have his own shrine. U know what, this is becoming like a music zoo, we gotta think of a clever name.
@steelnstarlight I know u live for ITZ. OMG these exhibits are gonna be the highlight of the zoo. Fxck the animals lmao
@steelnstarlight I dont like "fierce" either lmaooo. ITZ is a freakin gem. Love that album.
@steelnstarlight And in the zone!!!
@steelnstarlight RTW sucks ass, video slayed tho. We'll just play the whole B'day &amp; 4 album in her exhibit. Which 2 Brit albums? I choose FF
@steelnstarlight 2 hyenas, one lion, and a huge black horse...all the animals from the Run the world video
@steelnstarlight *makes sizzling noise with my teeth* I didnt think of that :(. What a slap that wud be lol. Ok let me redo dat 1 lol
@steelnstarlight *cuz of
@steelnstarlight yasss! We can put a python (i think) 4 brits performance and a giraffe cuz 4 Beys long azz neck
I'm still tryna find out why Rihanna is called a musician/artist/singer. Smh. That "outfit" is ridiculous.
@steelnstarlight We should put a Beyonce section &amp;  a Britney section in there somehow
@steelnstarlight Rotflmao! That'll be our song that plays when ppl enter the zoo
@steelnstarlight If we dont believe in ourselves, who will? We need to get jobs and start "stackin cake" *rapper voice*
@steelnstarlight We can't even afford Islands of Adventure :/. But we can still do this, we just gotta be dedicated. Gotta save every dollar
@steelnstarlight Im on it! But where do we get the animals??? How much u think a lion, tiger, or bear cost?
@steelnstarlight I'll be ur investor.
@steelnstarlight Too damn adorable!
@steelnstarlight Ohhh. Speaking of animals, look at this cuteness 
@steelnstarlight Well obviously not Kayleigh if ur hoping shes pregnant
@steelnstarlight I think so 2.  Animals are just so different. I need to learn all this stuff if im gonna own 1. R kayleigh &amp; Heidi spayed?
@steelnstarlight True teas. another thing ive always wondered is do dogs get preg everytime they have sex? or does it just happen randomly?
@steelnstarlight But its true tho thats when most women are the horniest because of the extra hormones your body is releasing.
@steelnstarlight EXACTLY. I could never do it. Unsanitary, gross, messy, and oh yeah gross lol.
@steelnstarlight ohhhh. dang. so they be horny but cant get jiggy LOL let me stop. I know even for most women, they're horny on their period
@steelnstarlight Sex during what? while they're in heat? or during their period?
@steelnstarlight Sooo do the go in heat like once a month then? I thought it was a seasonal thing. I know nothing about dogs lol
@steelnstarlight How do you tell when a dog is in heat? and will a dog still have sex even if they're not in heat?
@steelnstarlight SMH. Well, were they ever together? like in the cage?
@steelnstarlight :o She,s been preg before? Where are her pups? And oh lord. Do they have doggie pregnancy tests?
@steelnstarlight true :/. If i were to get a pom, it wud be a black one. i dont like the light brown ones
@steelnstarlight U first on the list lol. but true, I never thought about it like that. Do ppl ever cut their hair/
@steelnstarlight Im gon get a pug or frenchie 1 day, mark my words lol. Poms are super cute but I dont think I can deal with all their hair
@steelnstarlight exactly lol so I figured you wouldnt agree. I loooooove pugs, I want one so bad. and french bulldogs!
@steelnstarlight Thats why they dont tickle my fancy sometimes. I like dogs that look like dogs lol
@steelnstarlight Chihuahuas really do be lookin human-ish sometimes tho. Super slack-ees. But what else is new
@steelnstarlight ROTFLMAO lmao lol! U already know what it is wit us. We never do what we say we gon do lol God I wish u cuda seen my face

@steelnstarlight Yall were NOT overreacting. OMG what the hell is goin on over there!!! is it frog season? Wel, When is frog season? lmao
@steelnstarlight *shakes head* I still cant believe this happened to you, like, that is legit my worst fear in life. Did anybody laugh at u?
@steelnstarlight No, its not ur fault, its that punk ass frogs fault. Ugh! I still cant believe this happened to u, this is my greatest fear
My best friend just experienced my greatest fear in life - a frog fell on her face!!!! Please pray for her! I couldn't even imagine!
@steelnstarlight ahhhhhhh! Im over here flinching and cringing! Im so sorry for your catastrophic experience :/, thats my worst nightmare
@steelnstarlight Was it, like, was it one of those little slimy green frogs or was it one of those brown ugly ones? ugh! Thank GOD no toads!
@steelnstarlight I feel so bad for you, no one deserves that omg im freaking out. was it big or small?! what kind of frog was it?
@steelnstarlight AHHHHHHHHH!!!!! omg! UGH! i HATE THEM THEY'RE A WASTE OF SPACE ON EARTH!
@steelnstarlight What the fuck? How exactly did it land on your face? Did it drop from the top of the door?
@steelnstarlight What in the PURPLE hell?!?!! OMG what happened?!
Just spent 2 full hours on the phone with two 5 years old girls talking about absolutely nothing and had a damn good time lol.
I talk country too but they take it to a whole new level lol.
My nieces talk country as hell lol. But they growing up with my grandma so what else should I expect lol
My niece pronounces Florida as "Flo-da" lol
I can't believe I woke up all by myself.
I'm so proud of myself lol.
It took me nearly a month but I finally programmed my body to wake up at 9am. I woke up at 9:06 this morning!
Im 100% addicted to my cell phone but I could/would never drive and be on it at the same time. So irresponsible!
Texting and driving infuriates me.
This fool is lookin thru text messages while he driving and its pissing me off. Hes driving slow af and he swerved out the lanes.
This choir is saaaangin today!
This choir just went HAM on this song but I have no idea what they was saying the entire time.
Sunday Funday.
I woke up at 10am but it feels like 5pm right now.
@TipsForYouDaily Who the hell are you to call someone "shallow"? gtfoh lol
Just found out that some of my family is in town!!!
Don't get me wrong, its still hot lol. But soooooo much cooler!
Im truly grateful for this weather. It was so horribly hot yesterday and all this week but I feel wind today!
It feels nice to leave the south side lol. Haven't been downtown in a while.
Im out and about today. Thank God its not as hot as it was yesterday.
"@TipsForYouDaily 
I remember being so sad as a kid when John made the mummy army kill Anak sa la moon. Or however the hell u spell her name lol.
Watching "The Mummy". I used to LOOOOVE this movie when I was a kid!
I know I ain't been right for a while. Didn't have to tell me to make me feel like shit.
One of the workers at volunteering today said that I seem like I'm losing my mind....thanks.
94 degrees outside. I wanna tell Florida to go to hell but obviously, it's already there.
I smell chinese food and im starving :(. too late to cook anything so all i have is granola bars.
I chose a documentary.
I'm tryna decide if I should find a good documentary on YouTube to watch or just take a nap like I'm tempted to.
This fly/moth thingy been in my room for over 3 days &amp; I havent been able to kill it yet. I have to set time aside to devote to killing it.
I just wanna get worked to death for minimum wage like everyone else...Is that too much to ask?
Its funny cause when I go in a fast food restaurant, all I see are horrible &amp; lazy employees &amp; I just think...How the hell they get hired?!
As I was JUST tweeting about not being able to find a job someone else tweets "Glad my lil sister got a job now" on my timeline -___-
I have all the time in the world to go to work but no one wants to hire me.
Then I go on Facebook and all I see is "I got an interview today!", "I got the job!", "I just got a call back". Like, what the hell?
If I fall back, it's like idc but I call and go in person, it seems like I'm annoying them. Idk how ppl get jobs so easily.
I really wish I knew what I'm doing wrong when I try to find a job. I have the worst luck.
I just came up with a rule: I'm not leaving the house if it's 90 degrees or above!
86 degrees outside but it feels like 106
It's so damn hot outside, I honestly felt like I was about to die when walking to winn dixie! Too fucking hot!
Aint nothin like over 9 hours of skyping with your best friend.
Okay. Im gonna need for JLO and Pit bull to either get married or make a damn album together and get it over with.
@steelnstarlight Okay im here. bout to sign in. You call when u sign in
@steelnstarlight Actually, give me about 30 min because my stomach is roaring like a lion, im bout to go walk &amp; get a pizza real quick
@steelnstarlight Hey girl. Did ya still wanna skype today?
That trailer or whatever the hell it was is gon have me up for the rest of the night!
That website link actually works!!! LMAO Im dying over here!
WTF It says "
That trailer/video was hot af! I KNOW wont be that petty and not release it. They'd be stupid to not release it!
"Coming Never" How fucking petty can you be!!! LOL
What. In. The. Blue. Hell?! 
@steelnstarlight Okey dokeys.
@steelnstarlight No doubt.
"@BestEarthPix This is what happens when a seal runs into glass 
Im cooking chicken alfredo today. Havent cooked it since last year.
Walmarts self check out was tryna jip me outta $4 but I already had my items tallied on my calculator lol. Cant fool me!
Im sooooo bored.
Im so fucking stupid. I thought today was Friday so I looked at the wrong bus schedule and came outside 20 minutes early.
Thats why the utility bill so damn high. The dryer takes up a ton of electricity.
My roommates take about 3 fucking days to do laundry.
@AETV I just got finished watching it tho. It just went off.
ME getting this excited shows that I'm a legit kid lol #Imcoolwiththat
Can't remember the last time I watched Shrek. And it's coming on AGAIN!!!
Shrek AND a new episode of the First 48 is on! Oh, Praise be to Jesus!!!! :)
People are so sensitive these days, I even find myself doing it. Ugh
My horoscopes be so on point. I must be like quintessential Capricorn.
I always laugh when I see people on the bus with Beats by Dre headphones.
I feel like muting everyone on my timeline. All I'm reading is bullshit.
These ppl told me to come back at 4pm so I walked to walmart and been in here for the past 30 min tryna pass time lol
I can't believe I feel like going to sleep at 11:30pm....just so unnatural.
@_lexiplexi Exactly, Its just they life and apart of their life is that you always being watched &amp; stuff can possibly get leaked.
Im about to cook fish with mashed potatoes on the side. Idk how this is gonna turn out but its all I got lol
@_lexiplexi I just hate how evrything gotta turn n2 a stunt or conspiracy wen it comes 2 Bey &amp; Jay. They a real couple who go thru real shit
@_lexiplexi They buying her concert tickets cuz shes Beyonce - a talented performer who a lot of ppl love. They dont even need publicity lol
We so used to this "reality" tv shit, we have to question the authenticity of everything.
A celebrity can't even trip walking down the street with someone saying it was a "stunt" for publicity.
People are so brainwashed nowadays, they'll believe anything. They believe everything has to be a conspiracy or a stunt.
@_lexiplexi No, I havent. Obviously Bey dont give a damn about what ppl want. Ppl want pics of Blue but Bey aint shown her face in pics yet.
@_lexiplexi Tbh, if thats something that ppl want to see then they need to grow up. so I guess acting a fool is the new thing nowadays
@_lexiplexi I love that they're private &amp; they SHOULD be private. So you saying that ppl wanted to see Solange attack Jay in an elevator?
@_lexiplexi dte = down to earth. Well, just cuz u wud dont mean that they did. You been a Bey fan too long to know that she wudnt do that
@_lexiplexi Also, if they wanna show down to earth, all they had to do was release a pic from their wedding cuz we all been dying to see lol
@_lexiplexi Girl, Who been in ur ear cuz I know u know better than this lol. That wasnt DTE, it was immature. Btw, they money is irrelevant
@_lexiplexi You think they chose to show us this? Lol come on, now. U can even see the guys hands recording it in the vid from the monitor
@_lexiplexi They normal ppl, they got problems 2, everything bad that happens w/ them aint a stunt. &amp;the tour sold out BEFORE this situation
@_lexiplexi more like solanges publicity people
Im surrounded by about 8 ignorant ass females right now. Cant wait till they get off this bus.
Seems like her petty ass dont even know she wrong. RT @OnlyHipHopFacts: Solange has deleted all photos of Beyonce from her instagram.
@rnickel1986 @OnlyHipHopFacts exactly! Ppl dont talk about that tho smh
@steelnstarlight I would say "get it together" but then I'd be a hypocrite lol. I was procrastinatin today, I only fille out 1 app today
@steelnstarlight Btw, any update on the warehouse (?) job?
@steelnstarlight Total class. But Bey gives you nothing but class so I thats what I expected.
ME: RT @BestofCapricorn #Capricorn's are the biggest procrastinators, but when the job gets done it's to perfection.
@steelnstarlight Lmao I just woke up from a nap. But Bey and Jay are at the heat/nets game right now. I knew they were fine lol
@steelnstarlight Oh, for sure. The press isnt gonna stop until they figure out whats goin on.
@steelnstarlight :( Its just funny how creative they get with them lol. *shakes head* Even tho they wont, I REALLY want them to say somethin
@steelnstarlight They just funny tho :(  I cant take it LOL 
@steelnstarlight LOL. I should have never looked at that TT, now im laughing at all of these :(
@steelnstarlight Girl...Now Idt this situation is funny AT AL but I LOL when I saw this 
@steelnstarlight Forreal. I haven't even eaten since this morning and having even been hungry.
@steelnstarlight lmao. This is all too much for me, my head is starting to hurt.
@steelnstarlight Oh, you tryna Rhyme, huh? Lol
@steelnstarlight He got a busted lip all for Solo's ass. Smh. Who wuda thunk it? LOL. you would think a busted lip wud come from a pap
@steelnstarlight she just needs to grow up. he shud LOL. I thought his job was to deal with the paps and crazy fans, not her damn sister lol
@steelnstarlight Jay arguing at the end.
@steelnstarlight Thats exactly how she feels. and she tried to attack TWO more times. Like, wtf? It was hard for me to see Bey and cont
@steelnstarlight LONGER version 
@steelnstarlight I totally agree. I think that IG post was towards Solange. And dont worry we all lose brain cells every day lol
My point is that Jay Z WAS the victim. Idc if Solange was a monkey, she was tryna beat his ass. She was wrong. Sticking up 4 Bey or not.
Yeah right, Yall wuda called Jay a woman beater in a heartbeat. but cuz solange is a woman she can hit him for whatever reason. Smh.
This situation shows whats wrong wit a lot of women today. So if Bey &amp; Solo were fighting &amp; Jay stepped in, he wud have been wrong? or nah?
@steelnstarlight 
Ugh. Pisses me off how sum women think that they can do whatever just becuz they're a woman. You're a HUMAN 1st. Keep ur hands to ur MF self
I can't believe some ppl tryna make it to where Jay Z isn't the victim when he IS. He was physically attacked. Idc if it was by a woman.
@CamilleVBaker It could have been anything. Prob didnt even involve Bey. Jay &amp; Solo have had their own rlshp for nearly 15 yrs.
@CamilleVBaker Well he was physically attacked so he is a victim. Bey stood by Jay da entire time/knocked Solos leg down when she kicked him
@steelnstarlight I dont think its really an "uh oh" I took it as thats shes just gonna pray on it.
I agree with my last RT. Jay probably INSISTED that Bey go with solange cuz she had CLEARLY lost her damn mind.
@steelnstarlight Oh snap someone just realized that Bey posted this the morning after that night. 
I feel bad but I WANT AUDIO TO THAT VIDEO SOOOOOOO BAD!
@steelnstarlight I was talkin to my cousin on the phone and she said that they prob saving the Audio for later to make more money lol
@steelnstarlight Hopefully we'll getl lucky tho. I still cant believe this
@steelnstarlight Do they usually have audio is Hotel survelience cameras? I dont think so.
@steelnstarlight like a damn hyena fighting over food. Idc what Jay said/did her behavior didnt solve anything.
@steelnstarlight Ikr. I actually feel sad :/. But tbh, I wanna know what they was sayin! Cuz Jay was yellin back at her. Solo looked (cont)
@TheSkorpion I would say that she did, She stood by his side the whole time and TRIED to stop Solo frm kicking him.
@steelnstarlight Its already blown outta proportion. Smh. As a stan, I just feel bad for Bey. Can you imagine being in the middle like that?
@steelnstarlight &amp; Solange has ALWAYS had a bad attitude so I really wouldn't doubt it.
@steelnstarlight Exactly. sum1 made a good point, They said that Judging from all they reactions, U can tell that dis has prob happened b4 &amp;
@steelnstarlight (CONT) how she stayed by Jays side too. She did perfectly in that situation
@steelnstarlight I agree. She let Julius (her BG) do his job. She also tried to stop Solange from kicking Jay, which was cool. I like (CONT)
Solange has always had a bad attitude so what else is new
@steelnstarlight 
I'm glad Jay didn't hit her back cause then all the focus would have been on a man "beating a female" and not Solange ATTACKING someone
Solange was straight up wrong for that. Idc what somebody do, dont put you hands on people.
Most of us wuda kicked Solange ass for attacking our husband, but Bey did the right thing cuz then her &amp; Solange wuda started fighting.
I think Bey did the right thing tho. And she DID try to stop Solange from kicking Jay. She did what was best.
Omg. Thay Bey, Jay, and Solange video is crazy. What would make Solange do that to her Brother-In-Law???
@steelnstarlight My face when your mom started yelling 
@steelnstarlight 
@steelnstarlight Lol. Oh yeah, I forgot they usually hit it and quit it. Ok im bout to log in.
 Wake up my brother.
@steelnstarlight Im ready when you are. I know your fam is coming over so u prob busy.
@steelnstarlight okey dokey
I should really stay off of social media today.
@steelnstarlight It really does. Btw, If you're free today, we can skype. Im doing absolutely nothing.
Just called the driver and hes not even in town. Im going home. This is an hour and a half that I'll never get back.
Maybe its a sign that I shouldn't go today. Dont feel like hearing a whole sermon about mothers today anyways tbh
This is my second time coming out her tryna catch the bus for church. Still nothing
I am really losing it.
The first thing I did when I woke up is look at what time it was. it said 9:30am. Idk why but my brain thought it was almost time for church
I woke up, got dressed, &amp; went outside 2 wait 4 the church shuttle. After 35 min, I realized that the shuttle doesnt come for another HOUR.
I knew today was gonna be rough for me but I have completely lost my damn mind. Can't believe what I just did.
My feet feel like I'm standing on a bed of burning coal.
@steelnstarlight because im helping out these ppl, im busy all week till Sat maybe Sun. Idk what I've gotten myself into.
Im getting worked like a legit slave today. I kno I agreed 2 help these ppl &amp; I am getting paid but damn. I didnt expect to be a donkey lol
Fake ass signature for a fake ass storyline. RT @JeremyNicolls Mimi.....what kinda childish signature is that? 
That nap was heavenly.
I'm ready to go home already and the day is only half way done. I just wanna go to sleep.
Tomorrow is gonna be even worse, we'll get off at 8pm. God, bless my feet and back!
So sore from being on my feet all day helping out a coworker. Worked today from 8am - 6pm. My feet hurt but Im grateful for the opportunity!
@steelnstarlight Sorry girl, I was helping out a coworker all day :(. But no Ive never heard this before. Im diggin it tho!
I really thought that I was gonna have 3 A's, not two. Sigh.
Just checked and my grades are posted -___-. Its what I expected except for one grade. Smh.
I was about to have only mac n cheese for dinner....I cant do it, I need meat :(. going 2 WD real quick. Hopefully they have meat on sale.
Bout to make some mac n cheese straight from the box. cant remember the last time I had this!
*Praise Dances* yass! RT @jsullivanmusic New music coming 5/12… 
@steelnstarlight okey dokey night night
@steelnstarlight Im already laying down in bed lol. Okey dokey. We'll play it by ear.
@steelnstarlight I was waiting for you to tweet something so I could know that u were there Lol. I just ate so we shud really reschedule
Im reeeealllly tempted to go out and get some food cuz its faster. Sigh. I can do this. Let me go cook lol
I only watch basketball faithfully during finals lol
now, I WILL be watching the Heat Vs. Nets.
Aye, Drake still cheerin??? LOL!
That was crazy.
DAAAAMMMMNNN. that was such a rush lol
Drake need to sit his ass down.
This is a really good game.
No Sunday Funday for me today, got too much stuff to complete for tomorrow.
Literally just spent the last 9 1/2 hours on Skype with the BFF.
Lmao!!!! They did Drake so wrong
@steelnstarlight 
@steelnstarlight LOL *shakes head*  meet u there
@steelnstarlight Ok Im ready
@steelnstarlight Ok im almost ready. Gimme 5 min
@steelnstarlight im at winn Dixie rn so when u get home in bout 30 min
@steelnstarlight okaaay lol. But guess what, im officially done with this semester so are you free to oovoo today?!
I was sleepy but its passed by now. Now im hungry.
@steelnstarlight who?
Im FINALLY done with the semester!
This final exam schedule was from 7:30am to 9:30am. Its 11am and we still in here
Whhhhhhy didnt she just give a regular written test like other professors? I appreciate the creativity but this is taking too long.
I was supposed to be outta this classroom over an hour ago! This "Olympic games" final shit is ridiculous.
*goes to blackboard and pray that the professor cancelled the final*
The professor isnt even here.
Class starts in 4 minutes and there's only 6 other ppl in here lol
Out of all weeks, it had to rain the entire finals week. Smh.
I really commend ppl who wake up at or before 6am. I don't see how y'all do it every morning.
ANOTHER 7:30am final this morning. This is straight BS.
I really do miss my family. But when I go back home, Im like "Okay, whats the next bus back to Tally?" lol.
They're in town till Sunday. I asked them to come back to my house before they leave but they said they don't wanna get "lost" again. Smh.
Got to see my Grandma for like less than 5 minutes lol. but Im still glad I got to see her!
My grandma just left me a voice mail saying that shes two hours away from my house. *wtf face*
Now im the only one on the bus lol
Theres only one other person on this bus lol.
Im so blessed and highly favored this semester! My grades wont be perfect but they'll be better than what they would've been!
Just learned that the final that was later on today at 5:45 is now on Blackboard! Thank God!
I cant believe that exam had me stumped on one part lmao. Im pretty sure Im good to go in the class tho.
The rain wasn't that bad!
I gotta leave right now :(
oh, great, the rain is back! ugh!!!!!
Thank God, it looks like its letting up
No umbrella will survive in this weather! God, please let the rain die down by 7am
Its a LEGIT thunder storm outside. I have a final exam in an hour. I gotta leave in 30 min Idk what ima do!
Oh, great! Its pouring down rain outside. Sigh.
Up early getting ready for class -__-
Gotta be to class at 7:30am tomorrow morning. I hate when this happens :(.
This studying is for the birds.
The college student struggle is real lol. I know ppl can relate.
I remember in high school, I used to go to the movie theater like every few months. I haven't been to the movies in nearly FOUR years.
All these sacrifices I've made for college...It's ridiculous.
College truly sucks sometimes. I try to be grateful because some ppl want to be in my shoes but Im just not with this poor student life.
I feel like I've given up so much shit just for this pursuit of a college degree. Going to this concert is one of those things.
Beyonce and Jay Z are going on tour together. My dream has come true at the time in my life where I'm the most broke. Smh lol
This man behind me is legit screaming louder than the preacher
Sunday Funday!
@mysticgohan_ thank you kindly. ttyl &lt;3
@mysticgohan_ Hey girl, I need to take a rain check on our oovoo date. Im sorry but Im just feeling really down. Just one of those days.
This bus driver cant be older than 25. The old lady is at least 70. And the driver was yelling at her. No sense of respect whatsoever.
This bus driver bitch is arguing with an old disabled lady on the bus all because the old lady waited till the last minute to get on the bus
Im having such a shitty day. I really should have just stayed home.
Alot of young people are so rude to elderly people! No sense of respect. It sickens me.
Im just a basket full of emotions today. Don't mind me.
Its really hard for me to stay positive. Especially this year.
Sometimes I just say "F my life. I have no job, no car, nothing." then God always gets me together.
Been waiting on this damn bus for an hour in 85 degree weather!
I hate waiting for the bus with all of my heart.
Ppl say shit on Twitter tryna sound all deep and really don't know what they be talking about.
@mysticgohan_ okey dokey
@mysticgohan_ ok cool. i have no idea what time tho. depends on when i wake up
@mysticgohan_ thank you kindly! U free to oovoo tomorrow? After my test, of course
Got a 90 on that last exam! but ima save the last one for tomorrow. Sick of looking at this computer screen. *goes to YouTube*
That 5 hour nap was heavenly. Now let me finish these two exams on blackboard.
Just took a final exam that was literally the exact same text as the study guide. No, literally the exact same thing. Easiest final ever.
I'm officially done with classes for this semester!
Index Cards and the B'day album for the next hour.
This is my easy class so im not worried. Just dont feel like memorizing this stuff
Im only hurting myself tho :/.
Im trying my best to go slow af with everything today cuz I know once I go home, I have to study for tomorrows exam.
There's no stress like last week of school stress!
I need a break, a nap and a job!
Parental discretion is advised.
I tend to sometimes actually give a f*ck about what people say. I really need to stop that. Its such a bad habit.
That nap I just took was heavenly. Now back to studying. only got 5 exams left!
@mysticgohan_ you old hag, you.
Im stressing like hell tryna figure out 4 little questions for this exam.
@mysticgohan_ forreal. I was waiting on a text from someone and was going crazy. Then my battery went down cuz I kept restarting
Finally, it just popped back up on its own. Pissed me tf off.
Just went an hour without cell service. I was walking all around campus tryna find a signal, call customer service, everything.
I was right when I said that today would be boring. Waiting on my friend to finish writing her paper so we can go to lunch.
I just seen 6 different dodge magnums pass by in less than five minutes.
Today seems so boring. Hopefully that changes
I really wish I could afford a 1/1 apartment. now, THAT is my real wish atm.
I pray to the Lord that these girls go home for Summer Break. That is my wish in life atm. God please.
That girls has been here ALL night and shes just now drying her clothes...
The most inconsiderate ppl I have ever came across. Like....Lord have mercy.
Nearly 1:30am and this girl is drying clothes. If I were actually in bed, I wouldn't be able to go to sleep with a loud ass dryer going.
I hate feeling this way about people. I hate hating people but I cannot stand these girls. I try to avoid them at all costs.
It is hot in this house. But if you're cold, then why dont you just turn the a.c up instead of off? Common damn sense.
I feel so immature and petty by stooping to their level. But thats the only option they've left me!
She turned the a.c off again. I turned it right back on.
This shit is so immature. I should/would leave them a note but that never works. Apparently, they cant read. And I dont like talking to them
These dumbasses turn off the a.c again. And I turned it right back on! Ugh, I cant stand them.
Its a hit to my pockets but Its all about principle.
They probably 2 stupid or 2 high to know that its actually using more electricity when I have to turn it back on. But they still gonna deal.
They turned it off TWICE yesterday and I turned it BACK on both times. Im not playing with them.
and I turned it right back on when I came home. And when they turn it off again, ima waste money to turn it right back on.
83 degrees outside and these idiots turn the a.c OFF again. This is Spring time, not winter. Its hot!
Good morning.
It still amazes me how emotional yall get over these reality shows as if 1. they're actually real and 2. yall are actually on the show.
idk what ima do for that class
Tried to study for my test but I didn't know what the hell I was reading. :(
Debating on whether to go to class or to finish studying for an exam on Wednesday. Hmmm.
Second case brief done! Now on to the the studying for the exam -___-
This case brief....-___-
first case brief done! Ill do the second one some time before tomorrow. I dont freaking know.
Don't mind me, Im just tryna keep myself awake so I can finish this freakin case brief.
90s music was just so amazing. I always said that I wish I was born in the early 80s so I could have REALLY experienced 90s music.
Forreal tho, this album is hella good lol
If I go to sleep this late/early, I wont wake up till like 2pm. That cant happen cuz I got other work to do. I just may have to stay up.
The last two weeks of school is the most stressful time of the year for a student.
The case brief sucks ass (as usual) but this album is reeeeally good.
Nearly 6am in the morning. Working on this case brief while listening to Christina Aguilera's debut album for the first time.
Just went HAM in the frozen food section at walmart. FINALS week is approaching!
@mysticgohan_ No doubt. Ima need to talk to you after all this work to relieve stress lol
@mysticgohan_ So I cant skype this weekend. I have like two classes to try and save :/
@mysticgohan_ but next week is finals week. I got TWO case briefs due next week and a crap load of studying to do for my finals. (CONT)
@mysticgohan_ tbh, you probably could have messaged me earlier cuz i chilled all day and caught up on some sleep. it was needed lol. (CONT)
Maybe I should just woman up and go out in the rain. Decisions....
Checked Accuweather and its gonna rain ALL frickin day. I'm gonna die from starvation.
Ah, who am I kidding, I dont have take out food money.
Im so close to just ordering food. Thats always my last resort.
Know whats worse than heavy rain? Rain that takes forever and a day to stop. Taking its sweet ass time to get done raining smh.
This sucks ass. Cant even go get something to eat cuz it wont stop raining 15 freakin minutes.
This constant rain has fucked up my plans for today more than three times! And the dat aint even over :/
@mysticgohan_ nighty night
@mysticgohan_ I know how im bout to pass time. Go to sleep so I can wake up on time for class
@mysticgohan_ well what else is there for us to do lol
@mysticgohan_ Probably? Girl please lol its a definite thing
@mysticgohan_ I dont blame you. Wish I could do the same but Im surrounded by idiots. Hell, I live with two of them
@mysticgohan_ Yeah, drama. Its like ppl dont know how to live without drama nowadays
@mysticgohan_ Forreal. And we all love it smh
@mysticgohan_ Freakin weirdos. Just creepy.
@mysticgohan_ Im scared. I went to the page and it was like a spell check acct. How did they find us? :/
@mysticgohan_ wait hold the hell up, who is that????
@_spell @mysticgohan_ Look at you tryna act like a game show host lol
@mysticgohan_ awwww Bey &amp; Thalia! (sp?)
Breanna and I had the best time today at my house cracking up reading comments on worldstar lol
Gonna be like 15 min late to a 50 min class.
They know how to fuck up someones morning smh
I can't believe I actually pay for such bullshit service.
These campus bus drivers suck complete ass. Just waited over 20 min for a bus thats supposed to come over 15 min! Super late for class!
@mysticgohan_ oh hell yea ijs that its gonna be a long process
@mysticgohan_ I wish there was an actual cheat sheet, but no u gotta look up each ? individually lol
@mysticgohan_ the agree/disagree 1s were easy and common sense. the last 1s are the "have u ever stolen from work" 1s Jesus was talkin bout
@mysticgohan_ No, you weren't overthinking. When I was doing them, I was just like you. Research them but STILL think about them CONT
@mysticgohan_ And it went by so fast too. well the assessment part.
@mysticgohan_ But I already told you to Bing (or google) the answers. they're all over the internet lol
@mysticgohan_ Thank you kindly. and tbh, you're gonna love the  agree/disagree ones cuz the others suck ass
@mysticgohan_ Nah it was like half and half
Let me get to studying for this Stats quiz tomorrow.
@mysticgohan_ "Get it girl!! I hope so too then we can be bestie Walmart employees if we both land it." nvr saw this reply lol but totally!
@mysticgohan_ U should, I binged how to pass it &amp; it was easy, ONLY choose "strongly agree" or "strongly disa.." &amp; google the other ?'s
@mysticgohan_ I just finished my WalMart job app and I actually passed! I Pray that I get a call or email or something!
That was a big behind tree. Geesh. Thank God the tree didnt fall on any cars!
Some men moved it. We're finally driving past it. Those men were so nice to get out their cars and help the police officers move the tree!
Wow, a big tree just fell down while we were driving.
But I got Doritos instead! Cool ranch, of course.
I can't even remember the last time I bought a bag of funyuns so I shouldn't be so surprised.
Damn. Couldn't get my funyuns cuz they hiked up the prices. Over $3 for Funyuns?! Since when??? Its crazy.
A whole bus ride just for funyuns
Im craving Funyuns &amp; since I did a kick ass job on our presentation earlier, im going all the way to walmart just for them. I deserve it.
My life atm: RT @Dwhite09: I go to schedule classes for fall and not a damn thing is being offered <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
Im gonna be late to this class but what else is new
I have a major headache. Don't wanna go to class but I have to.
Now I can call back all the ppls phone calls I ignored and the texts I never replied to lol
I feel so accomplished lol
But we did good tho! The professor even said that "she was enjoying our Presentation so much" and we "did a really good job!"
Our presentation was an HOUR long -__-. My feet hurt so bad bad for standing up.
Presentation done!!!
Bout to present this project, pray for me and my group!
Ppl quote the bible 4 the inspirational verses but ignore the ones that say something that u dont agree wit or tells u you're living wrong
Ppl only work Gods word n2 their lives when it's convenient 4 THEM. Rest of the time its "religion &amp; the bible were made to control you" lol
The 1s who say "God is my only religion" are the 1s who'll quickly use the bible to their convenience. Like "the bible says dont judge" smh.
Alot of campus employess, especially females, look so miserable at their job. They look like slaves or somethin. U have a job, smile damnit.
I have a stomach ache/cramp this morning. Idk what it is but its annoying af.
One of the pennies didn't make it down the drain and I was so tempted to go pick it up but there was too many ppl around.
On top of that, he was a college student...like, how dare he?
Just saw a guy walk out the gas station and throw change (money) down a drain. F'd up my morning :/
@JerryLaVigneJr @AmbitiousSann_ Nah but I do miss the outro!!
My lrt is true but of course, ppl won't admit it.
@mysticgohan_ ok. Let me go pee then ill sign into skype
@mysticgohan_ its not okay, I just slept my entire Friday away. That food knocked me tf out. r u free tonight for at least an hour or so?
@mysticgohan_ -___- I literally JUST woke up. Idk wth happened after that food :(
@mysticgohan_ Good luck with that lol
@mysticgohan_ Hey girl. I home from class and my errands I wanna g eat something. Can ya give me until like 3pm cuz I gotta cook lol.
It's so rude to chime in when someone is trying to explain something. Let them tell the story!
I. Am. Sleepy!
I set two alarms and pressed snooze 4 times this morning and still almost missed class. Woke up 10 min before the bus came.
Good morning -__-
@mysticgohan_ yep Friday. Skype is cool
Had a hilarious conversation with a friend a bit ago that made me feel a whole lot better.
I just wanna go to sleep but I gotta wait until after I get finished with this shitty volunteerting at 3. Smh.
My avi is how I feel right now. Fuck today.
Today fucking sucks!
Amber alert 
I'm currently wasting an hour of my life by coming to campus and going right back off. Smh.
My other half is finally home!!!!!!! I can't wait to speak to her today! (I'm talking about one of my best friends btw lmao)
Smh.
If a girl is kicking a boy's ass I do not expect him to be a gentleman.
Nobody should put there hands on anybody! Idc if you're man, woman, or a giraffe. Keep your hands to your fucking self. Simple.
See, this type of shit here gotta stop! Im tired of us girls thinking we can do this fuckery and get away with it. 
Really don't wanna be in this class tonight. At all.
Such a busy morning.
Good morning, y'all.
Falling asleep for over 4 hours in the middle of the day&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Class is over, to God be the glory. Next stop is hungry howies.
Cant believe I been up since 8am and only had a cup of yogurt to eat -___-
Im bout to order me a pizza after this class is over and go into hibernation for the night. This starvation is killing me.
@mysticgohan_ You have NO idea. Only 2 weeks left of school so It's crunch time lol. U know ill keep u posted.
@mysticgohan_ Hey girl, maybe Friday after class. Got too much stuff thats due in the next couple of days. And too any errands
Im starving but Im stuck here eating yogurt. Sigh. I need a damn job so I can afford to eat real food.
Aint it funny how time has known to move on since the beginning and the seasons know exactly when to change?
Had to take care of business on campus. Tryna go home and get something to eat before class starts at 2.
I still cant get over the fact that people think that little kids cursing and acting a fool is "cute".
-___-
Actually had to come to class today because the first group is presenting and its only two other ppl here.
I had no idea what day it was when I woke up this morning.
And the class is meeting at this little event so it's not even a real class period. Definitely staying my ass right in the house.
My class starts at 5:30pm. It's POURING rain outside. AND it's a tornado warning. No class for me tonight. #hellno

Just a quick stop to winn dixie and ill be home. Rain, hold on!
Thank God I haven't been caught by the rain yet.
Just got advised and he didnt let me choose any damn thing. Smh lol.
About to get advised , hopefully! Im getting this shit out the way asap.
I felt so ashamed....still do.
Long story short, I found myself feelin some of his music. Then I caught myself and was like "wth are you listening to?!?! Snap outta it!"
Idk how it happened, exactly, but over the weekend, I was watching music videos on YouTube and I came across Waka Flockas music...
I have a confession to make...
Good morning.
LMAO at my LRT. makes you wonder huh.
Just heard Pharrel's "Happy" song for the first time. I'm not really feelin it. It's cute though.
It's almost 80 degrees out side and I come home to the AC being turned completely off. It was hot af when I walked in here.
If you're cold, then turn the ac UP, not off. I thought that was common sense but I learned a long time ago that common sense ain't common!
They used to turn the AC to like 65 degrees last semester (in the FALL) but now that Spring is coming, they wanna turn it off. wtf?
So I keep turning it back on, even though i know that's wasting energy but I'm just not F'in with them no more.
It has been between 70 - 85 degrees all week but they KEEP turning the AC off. Like, who does that??? Its hot outside and in the house!
I always have a lot of patience but my roommates are wearing it very thin. Im so over my them, I don't take their BS anymore.
Church was great but all im thinking about right now is food because im starving :/
But at least I know that today is Sunday Funday!
This weekend is going by too dang fast. Yesterday, I honestly thought it was friday for half of the day. Smh.
Good morning yall!
Got a 90 on my exam!
Guess I'll just do my online exam.
Just got all ready to go for a walk, checked Accuweather, and It's 46% rain at 2pm...which means its definitely gonna rain. Smh. :(
And shout out to them 4.0's and them 1.5's that don't mind and say "fuck it, I tried".
Shout out to them girls in the club who don't fuck with they professor.
FYI the starmetro buses are free today all the way thru Monday night.
I can't stand these girls. I really can't.
One of the main things I've learned since starting college is that common sense ain't too common!
*face palm*
Delusion is REAL.
This pure foolery and fuckery Im seeing on my timeline is scary. I never knew people could be THAT delusional.
Its 83 degrees but it feels like 93 to me. Good gracious.
Its hot as hell today. Geesh.
I gotta say it was a good day!
@Dwhite09 almost there
@Dwhite09 ok omw
@Dwhite09 ok meet u there
@Dwhite09 yeah I am I can meet u there before 5. I can start walking now
@Dwhite09 outside SBI.
@Dwhite09 ill take it pretty please
The rest of my day/night will consist of studying for this damn test.
It's been a somewhat shitty day. Smh.
My stomach hurts. Its because I have nothing to eat :/
Stu(dying) for this test tomorrow morning. I got all the info, I kinda just need to memorize it.
All BABY BOY -- Alllllllll DAY LONG! 
The top 2 things that I was reassured of tonight was 1. ppl say the same thing, just in different ways and 2. Ppl hear what they wanna hear.
And I actually stayed the whole time lol
I gotta say, that was a REALLY good class period. Those are the kinda class discussions you come to college for.
This is a damn good documentary. I would buy this DVD lol.
I see her point and shes making a good point but her attitude is whats killing it.
kinda wish the professor would calm her tits a lil bit though. We're talking about misogyny and she feelin some type of way. Like, calm down
This is a really good discussion.
So did half of the other ppl in the class so don't @ me lol
The "Tip drill" video started playing and I kinda did a lil two step in my seat lol
This documentary is really good.
If she yap on forever, ill finish watching this on YouTube lol
We watching "Beyond beats and rhymes". This is actually pretty good. I may stay if she keep the discussion to a minimun
I usually cant handle the death-like feeling I get from this class so most of the time, I leave early
She just said that were watching a 6 part video, stopping every 2 parts and discussing for about 20 min...yeah ima leave early
Time for my Monday class...AKA a weekly two and a half hours of boredom hell.
That Zaxby's was freaking delicious. Idk why I don't ever go there. They're too good!
I chose Zaxby's for lunch. I was craving the sauce lol
It feels like I haven't had meat in a good 5 days. That turkey crap tasted nothing like meat. I want fried chicken or something lol.
I made turkey meatloaf &amp; ate it throughout the entire weekend. It was disgusting but aint no way in hell I was gon waste food. I want MEAT.
My indecisiveness is kicking in again today. I cant decide where I wanna eat today. I know I want some real meat tho. *starts thinking*
I got plans tonight....to study my ass off for this test on Wednesday.
Good morning, yall.
Im such a corn ball. And have such a dry sense of humor. But I guess that's just me. *shrug*
My pastor just said that all the college students in the congregation been on spring break for over 3 weeks lmao. *puts head down*
Havent been 2 church in a month cuz of spring break &amp;my grandmas B'day. I, like, really missed coming lol. Didnt realize it till I came back
Okay im over it now lol I can honestly say Sunday Funday!
Lmao at my LRT. So true lol
Ima just keep my head down so ppl cant see my face and act like nothing happened. Lol.
No, its not. Not at all. Just embarrassing af.
But hey, I guess its still Sunday Funday :/ smh.
Just had an extremely embarrassing incident on this church bus. Ugh!
Good morning. Im going off of 3 1/2 hours of sleep. I've done it before, I can do it again.
Just sing it with piano.
Got my flash cards done earlier, at least I did something today.
Lemme start on my flash cards for my Exam on Wednesday.
I hate when I sleep thru the whole day, I feel like such a lazy bum who's throwing her life away.
I literally slept through this entire day. I got absolutely nothing done. I still got some time to get some stuff done, lemme be productive
@mysticgohan_ It looks so good! And this is coming from ME!
"@KidFury Welp. I'm going. 
Even though I tried to knock her out with a spatula, me and my lil sister were cool right afterwards. I was over it that quick.
My lil sister cried, told on me and we both got our asses beat with a belt by my grandma lmao.
I remember years ago, my lil sister pissed me off so I threw a spatula at her head. I missed but the spatula hit the door &amp; broke in half
Get me mad enough, &amp; I'll show u what hell looks like but I promise, I'll be over watevr u did in less than 5 min lol. Always been like that
I can be so rude sometimes :/. But it's just how I feel atm lol.
Damn damn damn! I caught the PACE girls! Didn't realize that it was close to 3pm. Hopefully they surprise me and actually stfu.
Rain always sucks. Nothing good ever comes from rain.
F*ck wit me, u know I got it.
@mysticgohan_ No, i probably was. Tbh, I never listen to any nsync or bsb boy albums so all i ever went off of was their singles
@mysticgohan_ you were team backstreet and I was team neither at the time. I gotta admit, i always like nsync and was nvr really into bsb
@mysticgohan_ Girl, N'Sync was the very last thing on my mind when I was 7 yrs old.
@mysticgohan_ probably lol i wonder what year that was
@mysticgohan_ Thats what Im saying, I kno we must have been super young
@mysticgohan_ It really is. Im just sad to say I honestly dont remember ever seeing it play on television. I know it had 2 be everywhere tho
@mysticgohan_ I was dying at the way his ass was walking like a chicken tho. "SEND RIBS" lmao!
@mysticgohan_ Umm see, I nvr gotta chance 2 get good at cookin BBQ...ever lol. Ill just leave it to my uncles. Hope next time they dont F up
@mysticgohan_ *JC* I want baby back *Justin high bitch voice* I want my baby back *Lance baritone voice* I want baby back lmao
@mysticgohan_ Just had some this past weekend at my grandmas birthday, but my uncles burnt them up a lil bit I was so pissed off.
@mysticgohan_ exacty lol. I would do probably anything for BBQ ribs lmao
@mysticgohan_ But pork and ground beef are never good for you. Especially pork. but go head and guess what my fave meat is lmao
@mysticgohan_ Actually, select meats are very gud 4u. Its how u get ur protein. chicken breast &amp; turkey are really healthy when cooked right
@mysticgohan_ I just cant live like dat lol. Ive thought about going vegetarian 4 yrs but was nvr able 2 go thru w it. I was raised off meat
@mysticgohan_ LOL. Meat was always the "main event", at least in our household lol. we'd b like "whats for dinner?" answer: "pork chops" lol
@mysticgohan_ Expand with meat. Sides are always kinda easy but if you can master the meat, then you can cook everything else
@mysticgohan_ I been working on my cooking game for almost 2 years. I dont mean 2 toot my own horn but lol I know you got me w/ the mash tho
@mysticgohan_ One of these days, you and I are gonna take turns cooking full 5 course meals for each other.
@mysticgohan_ *rolls eyes and shakes head* Girl...
@mysticgohan_ lmao no lie, I was just about to write "no mashed potatoes?" until I reralized that you weren't fnished w/ the tweet :D
@mysticgohan_ Gee thanks lol Thats cool tho, I would rather have a stomach ache than die of starvation, which is why I need the patties.
@mysticgohan_ Nah no need to new pack, they frozen so they still good.....Ah hell, just send both the old AND new pack Please and Thank You.
@mysticgohan_ Send em my way, Please and Thank You.
The back of my thighs feel like someone sliced them back and forth with a scalpel.
Super duper late. Ugh!
Its not my fault, my professor let us out late. Smh. I should've just left. Now im gonna be even more late to volunteering
Just missed BOTH buses. Fml.
Just tried my best to not be early to class.
Then I got volunteering right afterwards.
This is actually my favorite class but I just don't feel like going lol.
I dont wanna go to class. I really don't have to go to class but I just wanna be nosy
Why/where/when did someone let you write the handbook or the statutes on what a "real" man or woman is?
I cant stand those tweets that be like "a REAL man" and a "a REAL woman" blah blah blah. Shut the hell up.
My group was supposed to meet at 9:30am and im the only one here. And the girl had the nerve to text me "try to be on time". Smh.
Good morning.
My dumb ass forgot to push Start on the dryer :/
My stomach is growling but I ate before I left home wtf
I got a lot of sleep last night. I went to sleep so early. I really don't think I can hang like I used to lol.
@MAKAEL86 admit what? that anything is given 2 any1 nowadays? I dont get why U care so much. The person I see talking about it the most is u

We're having a debate on marissa alexander in class and the guy next to me is talkin the most and is too damn loud. Lower your voice, damn.
I know men are naturally easier to hear but good God, some men talk too dang loud.
Im sleepy, sad, hungry, cold, and over it all at once.
Good morning -__-
Im so pissed off that I can't even go to sleep. I should have been asleep
What a motherF'ing night.
Been back an hour and all I've done is lay down. Sounds fine to me
Tallahassee, it's nice to see ya!
Thonosotassa...Sopchoppy...Two egg....Florida
Looking at navigation and theres a city named Thonosotassa...lived In Central Florida all my life and never heard of that before in my life.
I know 55 miles is a lot but I can hold my pee for a long time lol
55 miles. Good cuz I gotta pee.
80 more miles -__-
Even though I despise I-10, at least it feels alot quicker than 75. I love 75 though.
FINALLY we're on the road. Good God almighty.
I have no idea whats going on, I should be in Tampa right now.
You know what, how bout I just give up and go around looking a hot ass mess....Yeah, sounds good to me.
Been tryna get my hair in a measly ass pony tail for 30 minutes. washed, conditioned, everything and it still feels like wool
I hate being poor so much :(
Or be able to afford to get it done! smh. If I had money, my hair would be in box plaits like they always used to be b4 I came to college.
I have no idea what to do with my hair right now! I swear sometimes I just wanna cut it all off &amp; go bald but I know it wouldn't look right.
Soooo can someone tell @_lexiplexi to call me please
......at almost 3am in the morning.
So, I'm supposed to be going on a road trip tomorrow morning but Im still wide awake.....
@2much336 ok yes, hes a loser but lets be completely honest, NONE of us knew who kim k or her family was before that dry ass sex tape lol
That cover of kanye and kim made it seem like they've been together for AT LEAST 10 years. Wth lol
We was in class waiting for her &amp; she was right outside the classroom talking to somebody the whole time. &amp; NEVER told us class was...sigh.
If class was cancelled then whhhhy didnt she just come in at the beginning of class and tell us Instead of us waiting 20 min for her!
Wtf. The professor was outside the classrooom talking the whole time we were waiting for her inside then says that class is cancelled.
Soooooo, I take It this professor isnt coming to class.
As much as I love talking to my grandma, I had to kinda rush her off the phone this morning. I had to go to class lol
It's my grandmother's birthday. She turned 77 years old!
Good morning!
The greatest trick Satan ever pulled was convincing you that he doesn't exist.
Thank God we got outta class early.
Just looked at my grade for statistics...it was like a knife to my stomach :(.
I went thru all that hell to get these papers printed out 4 class &amp; now she talkin bout she changing it to Friday. I wanma slap tf outta her
Gonna be at least 15 min late to class because im a dumbass.
What a shitty morning.
Sara Lee Butter Bread is the BEST. I just can't live without it! I celebrate/regret the day that I discovered it.
Omg whoever just got on this bus smells like pure wet dog :(. Thank God im bout to get off
Staring at ppl is one of the rudest things you can do.
*does the choreography in my head*
Listening to "Diva" on the bus and getting all of my life.
See, THAT'S a situation when you can say "God knows my heart" lol! I tried so hard to wake up but my body wasnt having it.
God is TOO good! Tried my HARDEST 2 wake up 4 class (literally hit snooze almost 10 times). Turns out class is cancelled the whole week!!!
@LifeCheating Seductive Sucker lmao
Simple minded ass students lol.
They were quiet as a church mouse until she brought up sex and weed. Then wanna get all loud and rowdy. Like, that's all yall care about?
This is a classroom in college full of "adults", yet they still go crazy when the professor says "sex" and "weed". Smh Expand your damn mind
I love my college lol 
My uncle called me and woke me up at 9am. I had 30 more min of sleep -___-
It's still raining hard as hell. Just hope its over by tomorrow morning.
I haven't seen it rain this hard in a loooooong time! Geesh.
I'm great at writing physical love letters. LOL let me stop lyin.
Cleaning out my closet.
When I went home, I saw how much weight my sister has lost. Im jealous. I need to start working out, I cant let her outshine me lol
I was gonna take a long walk today but its 57% chance of rain in the next hour :/. this is Tallahassee....It's will rain lol.
Today totally just flew by.
I had an eventful week, It wont hurt to take one day to do absolutely nothing.
I dont really know what Im gonna do today. Probably what im doing right now....nothing.
The laws of the world never stopped us once, cause together, we got plenty superpower.
Finally made it to my house! Next part is getting something to eat!
The bus I just got on was a few minutes early. And didn't wait like she was supposed to. See what im talkin bout, they always do this shit.
Great, now im missing the first 48. Smh
This is bullshit. Im tired/hungry/cold. And I gotta pee.
Been out here since 8:20. Damnit.
This is ridiculous. Tired of waiting for a bus that I was actually early for. But no I gotta wait cuz the bus leaves b4 theyre supposed to.
I catch a cold MAYBE every few yrs. I just don't get sick. I think it's just the climate change.
Aint been back in Tallahassee for even 20 min and I think I'm instantly catching a cold

Instead of fightin, instead of hatin
Why dont we further our education
Take the kids &amp; elevate them
And uplift…
Its been fun, Central FL. But back to Tallahassee I go.
Been on auntie duty all day.
Sensitive ass people these days. Grow a pair and stop letting everything someone says upset you
Why yall giving bill o'riley the time of day for his bullshit opinion? Ppl bashing and @ing him wont change shit.
@mysticgohan_ girl my dumb ass woke up late, but im gettin dressed and will def be there before 1

My grandma really tried me! She put this in my room knowing good and dang well that I'm terrified of…

When I woke up, it looked like we had passed Orlando, so I panicked (as usual) and checked my navigation just to see where we were lmao
Disregard my last tweet because I fell right asleep after tweeting that
Wth, now that im on the bus, im not even that sleepy anymore.
His voice is sexy.
Yesss I got the sexy driver again!
Redcoach is either right on time or like 35 minutes late. Wonder what it's gonna be today lol
Im so ready for this bus to come so I can go to sleep. Im so tired.
This Twitter update suuuuucks. It types so slow when I try to tweet something!
Im also just too paranoid and scared to miss stuff
But I was just always taught to be early for stuff, I cant help it.
Now im here an hour early. Smh. My ass could still be home right now.
I walked as slow as I possibly could to the bus stop and made it here in 10 min. Never realized how close it was.
Wait, hold up. A plane just disappeared and it had that many people on it??? Thats ridiculous.
I made it, I didn't fall asleep! Waiting for the bus.
What the hell I keep hurting myself today!
Thats how much time it usually takes me to get ready.
Im leaving two hours so Im gonna start getting ready.
Can't believe I'm still hanging in there. Ima be knocked tf out on that bus tho.
@mysticgohan_ We really did but I blame it on Spring Forward cuz it fucked my sleep schedule all up. I slept the whole a day
@mysticgohan_ I already know im gonna pass out on the bus, so we'll prob drop around the same time
@mysticgohan_ uggghhh. Thats gonna suck
@mysticgohan_ wow that crazy. U sound like me during finals week

@mysticgohan_ you, right I can do it!!!!! Ima keep drinkin water and walkin around every 30 min
The sleepiness is startin to hit me :/. I gotta stay awake!
Also, that way Ill just sleep on the bus
I think it may be best for me to just not go to sleep. I was planning to wake up at 5am anyways. I can stay up for another 5 hours.
Every time I go on a trip, I forget to pack something, then I always forget something when I leave. tryin my best to not do it this time!
Let me start packing.

#First48
I got SO much done today, its crazy. School work, clothes and grocery shopping, and an application I put off literally till the last day lol
Just submitted my application for a summer internship. Finally got that outta the way!
This new twitter app sucks. I should have never updated.
Grocery shopping always puts a dent in your wallet :/

En route to to the mall.
"I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that."
@_Diamond_Prince You kickin your legs up in your avi like a fucking show girl but got the nerve to talk about somebody else LOL!
@_Diamond_Prince Thats the only thing you can come back with??? LMAO!!!!  I can easily lose weight, but I know its harder to fix retarded.
@_Diamond_Prince No legend ever did all that shit by themselves. They all had great writers, producers, and choreographers on their team.
@_Diamond_Prince (cont) quincy jones produced the whole damn Thriller album, but I dare you to say that MJ wasnt talented!
@_Diamond_Prince (cont) MJ's thriller. EVERYONE hires writers. You think MJ choreographed his iconic dances? Think again! (cont)
@_Diamond_Prince Is this really what you correlate with talent? some of the biggest songs were written by other ppl. Whitney's IWALY, (cont)
Got a whole list of things to do today. Startng with this exam on blackboard!
Its 1:30am, the house smells like weed and seafood and I hear them downstairs clear as day. I still can't deal.
When I wake up &amp; go to eat breakfast, I cant even get to the damn stove because its cluttered with food thats been out since the night b4.
All my roommates do at night is smoke weed, scream at each other, make a 6 course meal, and leave the kitchen looking atrocious.
Just spent the past hour and a half on the phone with my grandma &lt;3.
I accidentally spit on my pants while I was brushing my teeth this morning and the stain is still here wtf.
"If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God It would be for girls to rock pearls Straight out the oyster." #Usher #Justlikeme #MyWay

Why is it that even when I leave early, I STILL wind up running late 2 class?! Who I gotta complain to, to make the Venom buses be on time?!
I been waiting out here for over 20 minutes for a bus thats supposed to come every 15 minutes!
Is the Venom running today or nah? Did I miss something?!

I think me going crazy this week is God showing me that I need to get help. I can't even see, hear, or think straight anymore.
Lord, have mercy.
I think my dumb ass has officially lost it. I just wanna scream!
Family comes first, second, AND third.

Had to show the bottom of the box lol. And much more that I couldn't fit into the camera! 
Now, THIS is what you call a care package. Thank you, Mrs. Macintosh! 
Whhhhhhy do I always get stuck with these night classes?
Now I gotta go to this boring azz class -___-
Today was actually really fun lol. Even got to do a lot of sight seeing
Good morning.
I need to start on my case brief today.
Church was amazing. That sermon hit me hard. I gotta get on my stuff!
Some people really feel some typa way about ppl who choose to go to church when they choose not to lol. I dont see why u care enuf 2 comment
The deacons are singing my favorite song and the band is ruining it -___-
I finally caught a ride to church. I missed coming here
Sunday Funday!
Let me tweet something I haven't tweeted in dang near a month lol
@mysticgohan_ *rolls eyes* I guess....you were 12 minutes late but yeah it counts for something. lmao
@mysticgohan_ -___- you missed the birthday singing lol
@mysticgohan_ so besides sleeping. what u been doing all day? lol
@mysticgohan_ *get ON my shit. lol
@mysticgohan_ *confused face* I wasnt expecting us to oovoo today i thought we just said maybe lol. its cool tho i gotta get my shit anyways
I honestly dont pay these media-hyped cases no mind until the verdict is in. I just love crime, so I cant miss a good verdict lol
@Kayla_WithAMar 4 multiple smaller counts (that add up 2 alotta yrs) than 1st degree cuz the situation wasnt a simple "he murdered him" case
@Kayla_WithAMar Yes, they are but at the same time, you gotta be reasonable/smart/realistic. In cases like this, it was smarter to go (cont)
Example: George Zimmerman's case. He actually would have done some time if they hadnt tried to make him get life.
they try to put these killers UNDER the jail so they charge them with the highest charge but sometimes that ruins their chances of winning!
@Kayla_WithAMar They really should have just focused on the other charges since he wud still get a lot of jail time anyways.
@Kayla_WithAMar Totally agree. There was def intent but in this case, it was wasnt "clear"/"firm" enough to be 1st degree. 2 many loopholes
My LRT is exactly what Im saying.
Picking the wrong charges is what let Zimmerman go free.
Picking the right charges is KEY because its not what you know/think/feel but what you can prove. 1st degree was too hard to prove/convince.
Tbh, the C. Justice major in me is saying that they shouldnt have tried Dunn for 1st degree in the 1st place. Too hard 2 prove in this case.
Lady on CNN: will this happen again and again? me: Hell yes, it will.
That's why I'm never surprised with cases like these. This been happening in FL for as long as i remember.
I been saying this for yeeears: Florida is definitely one of the top 3 racist states in the U.S. But nobody ever believe me lol
Hes facing up to 75 years (the rest of his life) in prison. Be glad this murder was actually convicted, unlike zimmerman.
Its like yall aint never satisfied. No, he wasnt convicted for killing Jordan Davis but  he still going to jail. 1 way or the other.
That man was just convicted (minimum of 60 years) and all yall can do is complain about him not being convicted for 1st degree? Damn. Smh.
@Beystanfolife jury couldnt reach a unanimous decision so judge kinda just throws the count (or case) out the window
Don Lemon is sexy.
@mysticgohan_ ok meet u there
@mysticgohan_ hey girl, i just woke up. are u free?
@mysticgohan_ I F'd up. I went grocery shopping, cooked , then ate...big mistake. I got the itis lmao. Are u free 2 oovoo in a couple hours?

@mysticgohan_ lmao just got done with my test. I was stumped a couple Times but I got more of the xtra credit so I should be good

@mysticgohan_ thank you kindly and I was gonna @ u after the test and ask you the same thing lol
@RattlersEdge thank you :)
Well...after I complete the test
Test in 15 minutes, then my weekend officially begins.
Im on the bus and "Single ladies" is on the radio. Im tempted.
That 12+ hours of sleep did wonders.
When I tell ya that I slept last night....I SLEPT last night lol. I went to bed around midnight and peacefully woke up at noon.
Im buying new jeans, shirts, bras, socks, shoes, every damn thing this weekend.
All my jeans have rips in them and Im sitting here acting like I dont need new clothes. My family is right, I am crazy af.
Maybe 85% of the clothes I wear are from when I was in high school....HIGH SCHOOL, damnit.
