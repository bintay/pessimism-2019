@Itsjustjoejoe @GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @keriRN @Tao23 The video was very informative. TYSM No Justice no #peace #AllLivesMatter
Totally agree. 
Nooooooooo! I just had a mini #nightmare,sorry, it sounds like Ghosts of politicians past. #p2 #Democrats  
You speak of truisms, I Hope @BarackObama puts it in the waste basket of veto where it
belongs, but he's signing it. 
#GOP/#RWNJs are self-righteous, catering to their base, some how they begin to think their on a pedal-stool. #ego   
@drjkapp Any major accident, the repair will be long, and slow. #environment remember the Gulf #oil. disaster still affected today. #p2
Oh Shell No! Take action to stop Shell from drilling the Arctic Ocean. 
After watching/listening to @MaddowBlog @maddow, we all knew #GOP/#RWNJs were gungho  passing anti-abortion bills. @WarAgainstWomen is real.
No more headlining #media spot, but he will go in his comfort zone, the entertainment channel, #FoxNews, softballs. 
She has the battle scars to prove her experience fighting fake scandals. Her resume is grand, PBO likes her ideas. 
Picking like "Fools Gold". #p2 #Democrats 
Yes it does make me very queasy that someone like @jiminhofe rules on environment and public works, @tedcruz Space. 
Open wide, stick #GOP/#RWNJs foot in mouth. #p2 #Democrats  
Bernie Sanders takes dead aim on Citizens United ruling 


No sugarcoating it, since PBO been President, #GOP/#RWNJs would pass a spit in the bucket. Now $478B from delays #p2 
Time to set in stone, I believe we're one of the last to make it law of developing countries
Great for young couples 
Good one! TYVM for the share. :) 
Love Is Love 
@kathleenparker right of center, so it's no surprise she's just cushioning the blow back of @CarlyFiorina HP era. 
@HuffPostPol Would've not needed it, if GWB Inc. would have done his duty, and took his PDB more seriously, There excuses is laced with BS.
@RD_MOLONLABE You sure have ample checks to ownership of a car also if a gun is ever used, stolen the state could whip it up, paranoia grows
@RD_MOLONLABE @usgunviolence6 @ccagiao1969 @SmithWessonCorp There is remedy, car insurance. I wish guns had the same regulations as a car.
@usgunviolence6 @ccagiao1969 @SmithWessonCorp We should have the ability to sue gun manufactures for unpredictable fatalities. #gunsense
@AlanTonelson @JeffreyGuterman #Clintions left WH having 14-15 million in debt for legal fees. They have battle scars, can't see sloppiness.
Only the #GOP/#RWNJs Donnie..........@realDonaldTrump #p2 #Democrats #VoteBlue  
#halperinquestions Have you called any one of the male candidates, "a Dick"?  Since you're a journalist that leans #GOP/#RWNJ PBO isn't one.
VIDEO: @RepBWColeman announces big #DebtFreeCollege event on the floor of the House of Representatives: 
@DaleF3 @marieann66 @Myclecycles @CosmicJetBlack @dlcpacfe You're VW. It's been an enlightening discussion. TY. We must keep soaking it up.
Maybe during Clinton's #nafta treaty, I'm not sure about #WarCrimes GWB Inc. trade deal.  
@DaleF3 Yes, the votes are obviously not there.
@DaleF3 Yes, like you said, #GOP/#RWNJs in Congress are all for it, next step would be to lobby are members @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
@marieann66 @DaleF3 @Myclecycles @CosmicJetBlack @dlcpacfe I saw that, I also like what Joseph Stiglitz wrote: 
@DaleF3 @marieann66 @Myclecycles @CosmicJetBlack @dlcpacfe Sounds like a who's who from  #GOP/#RWNJs to Corporate America.
@DaleF3 @marieann66 @Myclecycles @CosmicJetBlack @dlcpacfe Strange bedfellows.
We must be vigilante then, hold all to fire. Still I'm going to be patient. Soak it all up.  
Devil in the details, sounds like when #GOP/#RWNJ throw in a anti-abortion clause in a huge bill. We must read well. 
Still under raps, since public is in dark, how do the Unions know whats in it? Many critics seem to base it of past. 
@DaleF3 @marieann66 @Myclecycles @CosmicJetBlack @dlcpacfe That's the #FastTrack vote, to speed it through. I'm torn, I listen to both sides
@marieann66 @DaleF3 @Myclecycles @CosmicJetBlack @dlcpacfe I'm going to hold off judgement, we have 60 days to pick through it. I trust PBO.
@PGEddington @lhfang I never trusted former Rep Mike Rogers, too sneaky. Being the head honcho on Intelligence Committee, he's full of info.
Damn, more pushes for war, #PalestinianLivesmatter, but not to this coalition govt. US should boycott the extreme. 
Lame duck my ass! Kudos @BarackObama, working up to Jan 2017. #p2 #Democrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats  
Very #sad picture, the key words, "well regulated" should be like how are cars are regulated. We need to make it so. 
@FredChristian10 My pleasure, good topic, good share. TYVM.
Plz keep up the fight, unpredictability is never mentioned in gun debates, cars carry insurance, fees, guns should 2 
@PuestoLoco @ginou1010 @NETRetired @GOP Cheney is so crooked, he can't even smile straight. #p2 #demorcats
We could wear hazmat type suits protecting us from the Sun, wading through water, and damn #GOP/#RWNJs would deny it 
Wow, mind boggling indeed, this just reassure my depletion of #Netanyahu and his sorry ass "friends", #GOP/#RWNJ 2.  
@mmfa Such BS, incompetents running to the safest haven, #FoxNews. Softball anyone? #pathetic #p2 #democrats
@nebulouswonder @TheoloGOP It's like a cult, the paranoia and mistrust is there, add a little fear, BINGO! Try not to drink the Kool-aid. :)
BJ you're a real true liberal, I love your devotion, info, shares.. I'm so very glad you are on our side. #peace #p2 
Makes me like @BarackObama's free Community College, pretty #Sad when graduate have like a mortgage out of the gate. 
My Mom pass two yrs ago this August 8th, last time we spoke, I always feel your presence, #peaceandlove always. :) #MothersDay
@imcrews @BarackObama rules with convictions, @RickSantorum would be under the desk of the Oval Office in fetal position, handling hotspots.
@lhfang Good join the military, closest you'll come to Commander-in-Chief.
@DRMAction Avoid like poison ivy, might slip up, and get asked about "pathway to citizenship." Run for the Hills #GOP/#RWNJs.
@SabrinaSiddiqui PBO has killed many terrorist, OBL was on, many more top tier terrorist. @marcorubio fantasizes what @BarackObama has done.
@tedcruz Thinking you'd be Commander-in-Chief, I laugh.....and laugh..........and laugh.......and laugh.........and laugh........and laugh.
@MarkHalperin @ScottWalker "A" for having a snake oil salesman style. Substance should be a "D" because he's phony, "A" overall? #Kochsucker
@Wildeyezextreme Love to, but the elderly must crash, we have the whole election cycle. We'll tango again #peace
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 It's your party.
@Wildeyezextreme Yes, that's why PBO gets a better grade, pulling us out of GWB Inc. recession. @BarackObama also save the car manufacturing
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 I was speak to Ms Alison.
@AlisonSpalding2 Grow up, be an adult. #pathetic
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 More Power to you, but realistically your vote will nothing in your lifetime, life's to short to impact.
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton I'm not saying it was good or bad, it blew manufacturing out of the water for sure.
@AlisonSpalding2 @Wildeyezextreme BS, you're using a ole #GOP/#RWNJs trick, distraction and projection. You're a lousy #Democrat, it shows.
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton Different Presidents, differ ideas to govern. NAFTA had good and bad, Glass/Segall was bad
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton After GWB Inc. He blow it out of the water as a productive Prez, You're grading to severe.
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton She's battle ready, has the scars to show it.
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton You throw up all Bill Clinton policies, you're to cynical, spoon fed the BS talking pts
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 Hardly she despises #GOP/#RWJN ideology I have faith in PBO opine, "@HillaryClinton would make great Prez"
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton I was a firm loyal liberal, still am. It was a RW conspiracy, same ones taking down PBO.
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2  Tis free America, but if @HillaryClinton wins nomination, and you don't vote, #GOP/#RWNJ is only stronger
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2  Hell, if peeps don't know what @HillaryClinton is all about, their living under a rock. Attack, but zip.
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton So, of like minds. Bernie will cause her to go more left, but differences will come out.
Well stated, now to election will feel like an eternity. #liberals need to make their case that #GOP/#RWNJ hurts USA 
@Wildeyezextreme @AlisonSpalding2 Question: Why demonize? @HillaryClinton supporters aren't blasting #BernieSanders, we all want good debate
@Bipartisanism @pinkyfloyd1213 In my best religious metaphor, #GOP/#RWNJs have a tendency to not want to carry anyone's cross, except 1%.
I'm torn, PBO has never let peeps down, always looking out for MC/Poor, critics are basing anger on past agreements. 
@XGirlNYC @drjkapp @Boudica03 @TwinnerCat @AaronThorpe3 @Mistress_Jan @BioAnnie1 @PeggyStuart @thedahlimmama @TodaysComments #peace to all.
Kudos innovators; #Oregon for new voting policy, and background checks for guns, and to #Hawaii for renewables #p2 
@thehill 2000 Immigrant working permits, simple mistake, wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for a biased Judge 
 
That will be the moment when we have to talk peeps off the ledges. #BenCarson's silliness will be too much. #loony  
Good one. Let's send it to instigators @GovAbbott @tedcruz @JohnCornyn  
@TheDemocrats @BarackObama is hanging on every word with intensity, a good in depth listener, learning from the brave. Kudos to Vets of past

@kimmurphy @latimes Keep the #Conservative ideology over there, it will probably be more austerity to come, here #GOP/#RWNJs is cut, cut cut
Coming off civil rights, assassinations, anti-war protests, then Vietnam ending, class issues are out of whack today 
@tresa_8 My pleasure, sounds like the 70's was very important to us. I'm surprised I remember any of the era. Peace, Love, and Togetherness.
#CorporateWelfare helps the plutocrats push us into oligarchy, and the lousy #GOP/#RWNJs say open wide with perks.   
Good motto, mine is similar. I was raised a Catholic, organized religion lessen, and learning Science cast wide net. 
Well put, I agree, please don't jam ones religious beliefs down my throat. I respect atheist  too. #peaceandlove  
Excellent Meme. Very important message #Democrats needs to take heed, I'm certainly burnout of #GOP/#RWNJ rule #VOTE 
I too have #Hope as Ms. #maddow, yes we heading for a full plutocracy, to stop it is #Democrats needs to rule, #VOTE

@richdoll54 @AlisonSpalding2 @Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter They earned what they have, so much crap thrown at them, nothing has stuck. #fact
@richdoll54 @AlisonSpalding2 @Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter I think your thinking emotionally rather than #FactsOnly Hang on, it's bumpy.
@Clevelandpro65 @Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @angelwryter @richdoll54 
I've been communicating with emotional voters, than intellectual
@richdoll54 @AlisonSpalding2 @Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter So your of mind Clintons conspiracy is real, and they robbed the Foundation?
@Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @angelwryter @richdoll54 Reading your tweets reminds me of the Nader crowd of 2000. A nightmare. #p2 #sad
@richdoll54 @angelwryter @Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @DNC It's history, that's what #media and Peeps called him.
@AlisonSpalding2 @Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @richdoll54 Let's not get all self-righteous now, He did more good, just like he's doing now.
Yeah, many ran from PBO, #Pathetic.  
@AlisonSpalding2 Your pissy about HRC, despite her qualifications, I like her because she's battle-ready up against #GOP/#RWNJs.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC @HillaryClinton @RNC I've been thru many years being a devoted liberal.
@angelwryter @Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC Bill Clinton was known as the "black President", Google it, use your fingers
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC You be a official Democrat in Kentucky and win, besides Grimes blow it.
@AlisonSpalding2 @angelwryter @richdoll54 @Quicksilver2723 @DNC Hell, you're making a pretty good fool out of yourself, please cont.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 Yes! Lets crucify her, Hell it's only been 2 weeks campaigning. Your about as bad as #RWNJ.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC I want whatever your smoking, BS 37% turnout, they tossed them. #FactsOnly
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC Your sounding like a broken record, face it, you just don't like her.
@AlisonSpalding2 @Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @richdoll54 @DNC Maybe she was snowballed like the rest of us, how'd you do? Patience issues.
@Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @angelwryter @richdoll54 @DNC Have you every seen HRC resume? Hello?
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC @HillaryClinton Better look at a different calender, it's 5/6/15.
@AlisonSpalding2 @Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @richdoll54 @DNC It's what you do that makes #Democrats unpredictable, no unity. #P2
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC @HillaryClinton With your negative senses, maybe you all should join @RNC?
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC I believe she went to rally for Grimes. Google it.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC In loonie #texas, Hell PBO didn't even go.
@angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @Quicksilver2723 @DNC #Democrats were pitiful, no one voted, R's won, live with it now. #VOTE
@Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @angelwryter @richdoll54 @DNC Politics ain't bean bag.
@angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @Quicksilver2723 @DNC But there is going to be at least four D's. Keep up.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC Despite his sex wing ding, he was a decent President.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC I'll go with the one who beats a #GOP/#RWNJ. if @HillaryClinton so be it.

@AlisonSpalding2 Well to be honest she hasn't voiced all those you claim her to be. to early, I didn't know she is full throttle immigration
@angelwryter @Quicksilver2723 @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC #media is getting to you, but more D's are in, a good debate with thrive.
@angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @Quicksilver2723 @DNC Don't vote for her, vote for other #Democrats. No vote is always a GOP win.
@Quicksilver2723 @angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @DNC He did say "she'd make a great President" I want a good #DemocraticProcess.
Ahhhhhh........our new found liberal in the Vatican, set those #GOP/#RWNJs straight Padre. #peace  
@angelwryter @AlisonSpalding2 @richdoll54 @Quicksilver2723 @DNC Whoa up, we're not the #GOP/#RWNJ, we ain't gullible. PBO says she's cool?
I'm dutifully right behind you with all my liberalism. #p2 #Democrats #RockOn  
Lying Duke Energy, the ally in the State house, and former executive, Pat McCrory will try their best to weasel out. 
@mmfa @upayr  Checking with my #tinfoilhat informant, @HillaryClinton has blackmailed all State Dept employees. that or implants. #peace #p2
@weatherchannel @MiddleAmericaMS @AbbyWestbrook Hmmm.....terrible weather in mid section to #Texas. The man upstairs wanting #UniteBlue :)
The Ladies need to pump them out across the room, maybe they get the idea. NO #GOP/#RWNJs ALLOW!!!!! #p2 #Democrats 
@Maggyw519 I don't really understand the paranoia, and he hasn't screwed us yet, not in my eyes. Lots of peeps painting it ugly. Chill D's.
D's ran like Hell away from him during last election, and #media gave him no credit. Just be ready when he calls. 
@New_Narrative I anxiously wait for a political solution, still hopeful. #peaceandlove
@ARTSYJUDITH An embarrassment once again, if it were true, invasion on PBO words, just think of all the #tinfoilhat 's we'd collect, Recycle
@pittgriffin @SpeakerBoehner Indeed. #GOP/#RWNJs using the "code words" to bypass the Truth.
@pittgriffin If you decided to hold your breath when @SpeakerBoehner, other #GOP/#RWNJ said to help MC/poor, you'd be six feet under today.
Wow! Now that is an ally. The Hell with Putin. #russianaggression  
What a King too, holding power to control weather. :) #tinfoilhat  
@acehanna54 @citizensrock @randyprine @JAPITTER @boricuacoconut @TWD913 @TheDailyEdge @thejaoana @donna_dishman @dcfairbank Well done.
@Libertea2012 Yikes!!!!!!!!
@thehill Kudos to #JadeHelm15, US military, out of all the states to overpower, out of all the states, you picked the most embarrassing. #TX
@princessomuch They're sneaky big time. It's just like the "Religious Freedom Restoration Act" when there is no threat, it's legal bigotry.
@carmenvellon @MotherJones @princessomuch #GOP/#RWNJs use ridicules methods to change a law i.e. Measurements of clinic, Dr. privileges etc
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! #CollegeInFiveWords
She'd been very useless if she had to help in any disaster, think of @MSF_USA, Doctors with Borders, their humanity  
@SkaRhodes @GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 Free country, I believe Glenn Beck was selling doomsday gear. I've little time, bigger fish to fry,
@SkaRhodes @GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 Sure making dreams into goals into reality. I just don't believe the apocalypse is around the bend.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Maybe the hopeless live in a nightmare, unrealistic unattainable dreams maybe the cause too. #sad
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Yes, because history shows nations, tribes, to have some military, time after time after time.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Sounds like a dream, just don't be disappointed at the end of life. Choice your battles carefully.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 I'm not for a bloated military, I just want one, all voluntary too, no draft. #1 Nation, #1 Power.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Doesn't really sound reassuring, maybe your crowd should just drink the kook-aid get over it now.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 You definitely have a following, who I feel for, life is too short to worry about the apocalypse.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 How would you defend your people, domestically and from aboard? Fend for yourselves? Pacify? #dead
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 To have human needs, tweaking is vital, and I agree, Defense budget is huge, unnecessarily. #budget
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 As much as I'd love utopia, axing the pentagon, a policy from before time I would say. A no-no.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 I agree, Rep Barney Frank has made same argument. I rather cut a plane, ship, not even wanted.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 True, all the more capabilities here, "advanced technology" I spoke of. The Navy protecting Japan.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Every nation has it's trouble, hopefully nonviolent, but it doesn't always prevail, civil war. #sad
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Too much doom and gloom, I just can't swallow it, too Hopeful, and it's people are too. #Optimistic
@GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @keriRN @Tao23 TYVM.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Enemies by Allies too. Unfortunately we fear no nation state, just terrorists, a religious war.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Too cynical, so name some trial balloons? Ukraine? Somali, all of continent of Africa? Name them.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Transparency is the utmost important, and accountability. Right down the chain of command. Ironclad
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @SkaRhodes @Tao23 Must get real, nobody is for war, but realistically we have enemies, special issues all over world.
@GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @keriRN @Tao23 I'm in dark, plz nutshell "Babylon System" for me. I have an idea, but go ahead.
@GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @keriRN @Tao23 I would think that would be a huge issue, along with tribal leaders, and mass #MEDIA to expose it.
@keriRN @GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @Tao23 I agree, I'm in the camp that it could of been done differently, not put America out to dry. TY too
@keriRN I'm running........................................right into a beautiful female zombie......I'm hers.......#LoveMeSo
@GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @keriRN @Tao23 You make it sound like we are diseased or something. If America is "Occupied" it be chaos. Unreal.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s Sure you would, if you don't use the technology, it'd be your disadvantage. It's like cameras everywhere.
@GlobalRevLive @SkaRhodes @keriRN @Tao23 That is symbolic aka Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. There is a internal govt, the have troubles too
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s That is the result of advanced technology, internet, cameras the size of a pin, Pandora's box been open.
@keriRN @GlobalRevLive @Tao23 @8s Definitely loves yours too. :)
@TheTweetOfGod @upayr A #GOP/#RWNJ God I take it, sure sounds like it. #p2 #Democrats
@SkaRhodes @GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 So when is PBO invading #TX? Military did it back in 80's I believe, Perry was all for it. Hyped BS
@SkaRhodes @GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 Have you heard whats going on in #TX #JadeHelm15 More power to you last time I feared; acid in 70's
One big paranoid gun-toting insane asylum, minus sane #Democrats, my apologies. #p2  
#MikeHuckabee is not Presidential material. #p2 #Democrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats 
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s Really? No one radicalizes me. Don't let paranoia cloud your mind, you sound like peeps from #JadeHelm15.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s I agree there's problems, over-militarized of Police. But I really don't think NG has caused problems.
@StormyVNV @keriRN @GregAbbott_TX Withdraw and nationwide boycott, I love it, remember Arizona, they felt the pinch. Sorry fellow #Texas D's
@soloriffs1953 @thepoliticalcat @StopTeaBaggers Agree, in the hands of #GOP/#RWNJs to become lobbyist. It's crooked for sure, fight on!
@thepoliticalcat @soloriffs1953 @StopTeaBaggers You have no argument there, laying off 30,000 peeps, she must have 0 conscience to go on.
@c9hughes #GOP/#RWNJs want to strip many peeps from much programs that help them, those pesky disabled vets, needy elderly, children. Pricks
@c9hughes PBO doesn't control stock market, he has saved the economy from Bush's crash. He's policies have opened up opportunity for many.
@c9hughes That is #GOP philosophy, take from poor/mid-class give to the 1%. You best reread my last tweet, opening opportunity for all.
@c9hughes Helping Americans leveling the playing field so all has opportunity for economic mobility is what D's wants, #GOP wants plutocracy
@c9hughes Maybe you'll learn about empathy, a feeling lacking from many #GOP/#RWNJs hearts. Tough to get $$ from #GOP rule. Cut, cut, cut.
@c9hughes You probably think Yemen a good place for family vacation too, PBO has done more than you care to admit, because Hannity says so.
@thepoliticalcat @soloriffs1953 @StopTeaBaggers LOL. She'll be President....at her local neighborhood Home commitee.
@c9hughes Yes, we don't vote letting #GOP/#RWNJs in Power. No lets not speak of GWB, worst Pres ever, debt and economic disaster. Try again.
@c9hughes Just fear of #GOP/#RWNJs in Power, usually they're piss poor in governing, than #Democrats have to clean up the mess. i.e GWB Inc.
What a classy idea to push, it's overdo. #REALwomenmove #woman #Equality #p2 #Democrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats  
@DaleF3 Done. Definitely on workers side. TY for share Dale. #peace
@c9hughes Easy, all #GOP/#RWNJs are idiots, especially unrealistic religious zealots, you all have a superiority complex, add #lies for $$.
@USRealityCheck This paranoia has been around since PBO has been elected, it's not enough, PBO isn't a dictator, they have to pretend harder
@ImTheQ @WarOnWarOff She is tapping into peeps fears and hate for the "almighty dollar" just like most #RWNJs. Dry up funds, protest events.
@RealDwneastDiva @c9hughes All I can say is he's a #GOP/#RWNJ, need I say more. #sneakynuts #lies
@keriRN Absolutely nice, big time energy efficient, maybe I can tap into one in my next lifetime, then again, I am moving to CO soon...:)
@keriRN Yes, very cool indeed, especially the usage of renewable, i.e. glass, cans, and tires. I've seen something like these minus paranoia
@keriRN I'll check it out, TY Darling. :) #peace
@keriRN @GregAbbott_TX is just feeding the delusion, no doubt sought Perry's advice too. I wonder if #Mexico wants TX back, maybe shame them
@keriRN @GlobalRevLive @Tao23 @8s LOL all in the past Keri, all in the past. I would have to think about it if I lived in #Texas, no reality
@keriRN @GlobalRevLive @Tao23 @8s Yep, They been whaling on that PBO wanted to take guns for 6 yrs now. Wrong again #NRA. The BS amazes me.
@keriRN @GlobalRevLive @Tao23 @8s Me too Keri, I never was conspiracy nut, I'm to much into facts and Truisms. Last time paranoid, acid 70's
@keriRN @GlobalRevLive @Tao23 @8s Exactly, Governors usually, but recall they were used for GW Inc. war pretty heavy. I really don't fear NG
Certainly great news, Nigeria proving itself, now to mop up this gang, and return the rest of the girls. Many Hopes.

@ElingCarin @rjoseph7777 Indeed the makings of a compassionate advocate. #empathy
Absolutely Sharon, you nailed it. unwavering religious zealots breeds violence which indeed shows their hypocrisy.  
Chloe Hough, I wish I could multiply you by 3million with exactly your sentiments. With your guts, run for office.   
@JoeNBC It's not like anyone has a gun to peoples head to either give to Clinton Foundation and speeches. This is just vindictiveness simple
Indeed. I wish that fellow Americans would internalize the ideal by Abe Lincoln "we thrive for a more perfect Union" 
We own cars, they need yearly fees to drive, we need required insurance for unpredictability, with guns there's none 
He's so honest, he constantly adds to his overall integrity. @BarackObama #Democrats #tcot 
@RightWingWatch Hogwash, the anti crowd displays Bigotry big time. Thinking the way they do, this superiority complex, is by far "mental".
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s I agree on some. NG is good for disasters too. By the way, do fear, like #TX, playing military games in TX
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s Believe me, I can't stand local police have militarization of weapons. We became aware during Ferguson.
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s Deployments of NG domestically has only Ferguson, Baltimore. I fear police rather than NG. Orders differ.
Once again #GOP/#RWNJs behind in the Times, they usually are. #pathetic 
@GlobalRevLive @keriRN @Tao23 @8s Ironically, this is the anniversary date of Kent State Massacre. 5/4/70. Horrible day. I don't see repeat.

Great meme, this is why we fight the #GOP/#RWNJ machine.  
@GoodbyeKoch @AlisonSpalding2 If there's one thing we've learned from #Baltimore is unity across the land. Wherever #Koch are, protest them.
No doubt a very tough call, first hearing about the malformations, then the decision to abort. I respect her.  
@AP "Conservative Star", talk about hype.
@thehill Typical of #GOP/#RWNJs tactics, stall, do-nothing governance over PACs, fundraising events. #pathetic

@selinasorrels Indeed, the brainac idea concocted by #GOP/#RWNJs to privatize damn near everything, doing the prisons bred corruption only.

#Colorado are you really going to put up with this BS by all-male pols, I'd bet they don't even know what an IUD is. 
@Redone68 Absolutely cool. TY for the share. :)
@JasonBretWells @AdamSerwer @FoxNews I wonder how much of Roger Ailes's ass he had to kiss to even go to Baltimore, pucker up Geraldo.
Using religion to discriminate, hypocrisy at it's best, not surprised the #GOP/#RWNJs state legislators initiate it  
Making the playing field of opportunity level matters in curing the ails of #Baltimore. @JebBush  
Cool....more than a Freudian slip too, we'll take it. #GetMoneyOut  
Cotton is a known fear-mongering liar, and he's taking on matters that isn't dealt with adolescent behavior. Grow up 
@RawStory @upayr Don't stand for this #Colorado peeps, it's outright BS, just another misinformation agenda push by #GOP @DenverChannel

@LukeRussert Better do right by journalism there Luke. No hyping, no pushing wrong agendas. #media
#GOP/#RWNJs use policies that are deadly, i.e. No Medicaid expansion, Harness the anger and #Vote D, put $$ back in opportunities/education.
Why America can be a real embarrassment to itself. #pathetic

@52gopher @mmfa Unfortunate truism, maybe they lack investigation because they're labeled an "Entertainment" entity, rather than "News org."
Most #Liberals, #Democrats want a robust Democratic nomination process, clears the air, rectifies any discrepancies. 
@mmfa @upayr Rolling Stone gets nailed for writing a disingenuous article, yet #FoxNews can spread BS lies all day. Unreal. #pathetic #LGBT
@Marmel @helenmag @BarackObama, @SenateDems, even the @HouseDemocrats need to rally behind her, and pressure @SenatorBurr allow her a vote.
The same @SenTomCotton who lied to voters of #AR that IS and Mexican cartels joined forces and were coming over border, his cred is squat.

#whyvote, Voter participation is better governance, apt to do peeps business. 
Ramifications of not voting, just look at USA, GOP rule. #p2
Great harvest, some good stock, and a great idea for #peace.  
Why #Baltimore and similar cities across the land suffering poverty and lack of opportunity equates to hopelessness. 
@SpeakerBoehner You're just blowing smoke, trying to fear people that the debt is the most important is BS. What is next? We are Greece? #p2
@AlisonSpalding2 @HillaryClinton Too soon, specifics would open her up to critics. Baltimore encompasses many problems suffered by many. #p2
@CrankItUp6 Keep the masses feared and paranoid, easier for the oppressors (#GOP/#RWNJs) to control. Gov Abbott just adding to it. #Texans

@FUSigma LOL This meme reminds me of something Charlie Manson would get into, better go pray for the world there buddy. Gotta have faith. :)
@FUSigma Sounds like denial, and psst....I won't go bragging you think Cruz and Walker are intellects....shhh... Free of charge advise.
@FUSigma In the 21st century, Americans can understand the size of govt, boy, we sure did expand after 9/11...huh? Citizens want efficiency.
@FUSigma Newsflash: Life is short, only so many election cycles, so make every vote count, even more so if you have kids, beware of wackos.
@FUSigma Nothing wrong being a partisan, looking at your follows, I'd say you fit the bill. Your conservative party is hijacked with wackos.
@FUSigma Come on, I speak of modern times, not the whole rundown of American History. Pity you didn't conclude that. Anyway, I'm diehard lib
@FUSigma "Foolish Electorate" no argument here. Many faults too.
@FUSigma Quite the characterization, inaccurate but comedic. Refresher, #Democrats have always, always been for the people, the nation.
Bring it on. :) 
@FUSigma That's cool, I answered your hypothetical. I personally think Hillary will be the next Prez, and hopefully get the chambers back.
@FUSigma Easy, absolutely. Now prove it. Easier said than done, just like all the other GOP induced "scandals". They can't on their merits.
@FUSigma It's hypothetical, give me something solid like, should Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld be tried for war crimes? Absolutely, facts are there
@FUSigma Big if? I honestly believe there is no fire, like Benghazi, email, but hey, politics ain't beanbag.
@FUSigma I guess we'll have to wait to see.
@FUSigma Come on, you're talking about a political machine, surrounded by many, many lawyers, staff, etc. GOP does too. She'll answer well.
@FUSigma Absolutely. Let's put it this way, some one is going to navigate the national narrative a certain way, who will it be?
@FUSigma I'm saying she'll have the best possible legal answer. Obvious you can't stand her, but I wouldn't get your Hopes up, GOP sucks.
@FUSigma She isn't going to come out and explain, #media is already giving the author his dues to past writings. She'll handle it I'm sure.
@FUSigma I'm waiting for more facts, the book hasn't been released yet. I just don't see them be so sloppy about things, they know disinfect
@davidsirota TY for share. The corruption, like most for pols butts right up against "moral line". I just don't think it will damage her.
Schweizer's reputation is in question; #media needs to investigate his claims. I just don't see Clinton's so sloppy.

@Search4facts TY too. I've definitely enjoyed our discussion, your demeanor has been perfect. :)
@Search4facts Well said.
@Search4facts Absolutely me too. I just hope fellow #Democrats, #liberals #progressives can keep our composure, no acting like #RWNJs. :)
@Search4facts TY for the share, I still don't seeing him doing anything so....... GOPish, you know backstabbers. :)
@Search4facts I think it's not done because Congress gave him "Fastrack" to finish negotiations, then the final product.?.?
@Search4facts Umm...if true, it should be online for all to see, we should be getting analysis from economists, trade experts, etc. Details.
@Search4facts I think it's impatience, and yes Sen Warren is right, we need to see it, PBO is so methodical to get to the most perfect.
@Search4facts This reminds me of the days of NAFTA/Clinton, plus in a subtle way, last election #Democrats weren't squeezing PBO. They ran.
@Search4facts PBO hasn't screwed us yet, I really don't think he's about to. It's about ready to come to flourishen, I give him some slack.
@Search4facts Either one would mean a GOP win unfortunately, is the protest vote going to be worth it?
Of course, that good ole "economic wisdom" courtesy of #GOP/#RWNJ party. National #media should be all over this.  
@acompton44 You're cool, we're just dipping our toes in. :)
GWB once saw Putin's soul, he was mistaken because he has none. #FreeSavchenko #Russia

@KarenChestney @dailykos I can only Hope #Wisconsin remembers this arrogant conviction come election day 16'. Knock him off his cloud. #p2
I realize the divide in our party over TPP, seems NAFTA has made us trade shy, but I'm also highly confident in PBO.

@GetWisdomDude @cd5762 "We're going need a bigger boat" (Jaws) In this case a U-haul will do. Just think, 18 months of their BS. #p2
@BeschlossDC Cool. I noticed his large, protruding forehead, indicating a huge frontal lobe, evolution went backwards with #GOP/#RWNJs today
I wonder what the tit for tat details came about. I think @BarackObama gave his blessing to @JohnKerry. Specifics.  
@MModzelewski192 I recall when the mushroom cloud ad was used by LBJ, Iive for today, don't be scaring peeps.
Online? 
Totally agree, Oregon voting should be a template, #GOP/#RWNJs into suppression. we need #Democrats to rule though.
 
Life would be so productive, if #democrats, #millennials would actually participate in voting. Just see ramification 
But you're going against what the majority wants, close it down. Only #GOP/#RWNJs dream of keeping it open. Pander.  
@TheTweetOfGod @terbear7505 Are you taking reservation? Book me a room.
More evidence of #climatechange another objective for the deniers. I wonder if idiot @jiminhofe throws a dead trees. 
Kinda hard for #GOP/#RWNJs to prioritize an emphatic train of thought, they can't connect the dots either, gullible  
I automatic go to privatizing prisons, all it did was corruption to flourish, from the cops, to the judges. Unreal. 
#media was lazy, In #BUSH/#RWNJs pockets to push the unnecessary Iraq War, They gave PBO no credit for anything. #p2 
The national narrative by #media, @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @60Minutes @msnbc @maddow @CNNPolitics, remind the people. 
@nursingusa @seanhannity He's just a puppet for #GOP/#RWNJs propagandist Roger Ailes. That group who investigated Rolling Stone do #FoxNews
@KarenDoe50 Are you huffing some laughing gas or what. Most will be going for the far far Right, in other words #RWNJs. Republican are weak.
Yes, all #Democrats where their hearts on their sleeves, besides @HillaryClinton is just out, she has 18months to go 
Excellent point Don't forget @marcorubio wrote the Senate bill on Immigration, then turned around, went against it. 
@BarackObama needs to take him to the woodshed, give him a "intellectual thumping" then give @JohnKerry at him. :) 
Right on, good meme. #GOP/#RWNJs all they want to do is #gopwantswar, on top of that #GOPHatesPoorPeople "sponges" 
Jeb, too many skeletons in the bushes! <EYES>
What Allies did @BarackObama, @HillaryClinton schmuck @JebBush thinks that, I can think of one only, #Israel #Netanyahu deservedly so, a lie
@NowWithAlex @GlennThrush @HillaryClinton Sounds cool, everyone knows "Scooby Doo", geez eureka, at least she's not in a Limo #p2 #Democrats
@jonathanchait Meeting the people, and doing the road-trip, eating at fast-food joint. Be safe, be well @HillaryClinton.
A clown beating up the #clowncar occupants, can't wait. :)  
Good description Anthony, I'd add callous, unemphatic liars, #Kochsukers, and anti-gay. People will see right thru. 
That's both reassuring knowing the gloves come off. #politics is not a pillow fight, she's very intelligent, rock on 
Damn you @BarackObama and @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems. :) 
Time @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems to #UniteBlue and let @BarackObama @JohnKerry close the deal. Allies aren't wrong 2 
No comparison between @SarahPalinUSA and @HillaryClinton at all, the #GOP/#RWNJ hates Hillary because she's smart. 
#JodiArias-----------You dance with the Devil, you're going to get burnt.------------Always.
Honest, to the point meme. TY for the share. #PEACE 
Praise @BarackObama's decision making, and pushed for renewable energy. #GOP/#RWNJs will want to take credit for it. 
@OccupyWallStNYC @Sarah__Reynolds Good question, I'm certain she will prevail as long as #GOP/#RWNJs lose Power, and #Democrats vote. #p2
@rey_lowe @andendall #gopwantswar always, #FoxNews will provide the rah, rah propaganda much like the unnecessary Iraq War. PBO didn't cave.
They're schizoid that way, #FoxNews must lie, to use facts is beneath them. they'd realize their not an "Tabloid" 
ISIS vs GOP #UniteBlue
//"@NObamaChat: @nhdogmom You're scared.  You should be."

Great funny meme Jimmy, we need a Walker/Perry/Rubio also.  
@BarackObama has proven trustworthiness time and time again, I knew he would endorse @HillaryClinton she will win.  
@DebtTrut My honor, I hope PBO sees the satisfaction of Justice. #peace
Hi Beverly, I can't stand phonies, lies, trying to snowball the people, mini #FoxNews I would even throw in Walker. 
Done, hoping for the best. #UniteBlue #p2 #Democrats  
@postpolitics @marcorubio has no substance, like @RickSantorum. Both fakes wanting to be relevant because their irrelevant, boost resumes.
@qb_ramirez You too. #peace.
@qb_ramirez Catch you on flip flop, discuss climate change. #peace
@qb_ramirez TY I will.
@qb_ramirez Plus, by your logic, mensuration would be a crime, man masturbating would be jail, for killing live sperm.
@qb_ramirez Disagree big time, #Democrats are very open-minded people, we also where our hearts on our sleeves. Who wants to always cut R&amp;D?
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Did you grab your tail?
@qb_ramirez Sure, but I would think the Dad, Mom and adolescence would have a close relationship. I'd back her if she wanted one, fund it to
@qb_ramirez Off topic, it's like climate change deniers, it's all about science, I've been taught it's a ball of cells, no denial, science.
@qb_ramirez Although I'm #sad that she has too, I told you it depends of  which circumstances, i.e. rape, life of Mommy, irresponsibility.
@qb_ramirez Sure, but we wanted it baby, that decison we never had to make, but I respect their Constitutional right to have on, not digress
@qb_ramirez Hardly, #Democrats are #sad a woman has to get abortions, #GOP/#RWNJs don't listen, the option has to be provided.
@qb_ramirez Come on, if a women wants the baby, happy for you, and if its because it's life/death of mother, absolutely go for it. Rape too.
@qb_ramirez We are not for abortions, we hate a women has to have one, in that regards, we mush not strip them of the medical procedure.
@qb_ramirez Contrary, bottom line, I want women the right to do with their own bodies. #GOP/#RWNJs wants digression of abortion, Religion.
@qb_ramirez I'm confident, I'm for women's rights, instead of ball hanging Senators, House members state/fed levels writing abortion laws.
@qb_ramirez I believe 20 weeks is time frame, I'm cool with that, but like I mentioned late terms are rare, by then Mom's want baby.
@BarackObama is going to do right by the middle class, poor, college students, not letting up, gong for the gusto.  
@qb_ramirez 13yr olds would need consent from parents which I would think the parent is be with her anyway. Very late terms are very rare.
@qb_ramirez It's a Constitutional protection for a woman to choice, no matter what #GOP/#RWNJ Christians think, Muslims are extreme killing.
#pence is such a phony with a self-righteous ego, #scottwalker is his double. I suggest to #Indianans, #UniteBlue  
Exactly, not only #POTUS, but lets shoot for the stars, we'll take the @SenateDems and @HouseDemocrats too, big wins 
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton As usually with you #GOP/#RWNJs don't forget your tail.
@helicopterpage @nickisuz Enlighten yourself.

@helicopterpage @nickisuz I haven't been snowed in years, but #GOP/#RWNJ keep trying. I'm battle ready constantly, I don't tolerate Lies.
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Telling you you're boring is juvenile, I really beg to differ, no wonder you're dingy.
@helicopterpage @nickisuz I'm absolute when it comes to PBO getting it low. #Cheney had a secret meeting with Oil Barrons before war. #p2
@nickisuz @helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Is interesting, to bad his politics is a little off based. You too. #p2 #Democrats
@nickisuz @helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Sure sounds like a #foxnewsfacts wrong&amp;lies. Recall Bush and the disregarded memo?
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton I thought it was actually intelligent astute, you're reaction is because it stung. #p2
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Come on Glennie, that's getting old, #GOP/#RWNJ tell me something new, you're boring.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton He has a story too tell, and how he was treated by #GOP/#RWNJ, He trusted #Hillary2016, certain.
@nickisuz @helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Hardly, he sold it as such, but Cheney could taste war for OIL. Many died for that.
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Yes, he sought an attack, not war.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Doubt it big time, he wouldn't start an outright war giving it to Bush Inc, he went for twofer.
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Me too, veteran and a loyal voter, I just wish I could say the same for #GOP/#RWNJs.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Just pointing out they were huge lies, just like #Benghazi is a false witch hunt, throw in email
@helicopterpage @nickisuz @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton A stubborn denial you are, most gullible #GOP/#RWNJs are. It will get you nowhere. #p2
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Not war, but a specific attack, bio weapons, and nuke targets, not war, an attack. Bush all out
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde Hardly, Your denial begins with all those lies about PBO early on (Birthright) @HillaryClinton wins by landslide
@nickisuz @helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Then you're a blind fool that is spoon-fed  lies, garbage, debating is same ole lies.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Denial always comes on with fake giggles. Country is always better off when #Democrats vote. #p2
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton She was duped too, #media were lacks too, sallow hook, line, sinker. Ahh torture, massive kills.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Yeah putting the country with cutting taxes for 1%, and creating the farce govt is bad, no good.
@nickisuz @helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton BS, shes a grand #democrat, liberal. Unlike #GOP/#RWNJs who wants to supress the #vote
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Hell, you backed the war criminals #bush/#Cheney, that's backed by #FactsOnly #Ignorance galore.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton History proves since St Ronnie, every time #GOP/#RWNJs rule, #Democrats have to cleanup the mess
@nickisuz @helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton Yes, they blindly vote #GOP/#RWNJs because their ignorantly gullible. #VOTE #p2
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde For perjury, yes, but the facts align with  @HillaryClinton, I'm telling you this is a false scandal,#Benghazi.
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton along with many #GOP/#RWNJs, there's nothing there. if anyone deserves prison, Cheney/Bush/Rummy
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde @HillaryClinton doesn't deserve prison, if so, #GOP/#RWNJs be all over it, all they have is #Benghazi, nothing.
Democrats must know when they don't vote it's #GOP/#RWNJs who rules, and look what has happen since,BS, Digression. 
@helicopterpage @Lnonblonde Hell there's not enough prisons to hold all #GOP/#RWNJs #FoxNews worshipers. Get use to it, @HillaryClinton wins
Where is ours? 
No #GOP/#RWNJ would do nothing for children, if anything they would digress even more, why #Democrats need to vote. 
@BillKristol must have no love for the 2016 #GOP/#RWNJs candidates. I don't have enough toes&amp;fingers both were wrong 
Totally agree, if you think he isn't, you're delusional, or no squat about politics, which sounds like #GOP/#RWNJs. 
No sense for @thehill to make this a big issue, or hype it up like most #media does. Most voters are waiting to see. 
Run @ScottWalker run because you're a lying phony, and people will see it. @HillaryClinton will mop you up. #Vote  
@qb_ramirez For sure there are warped religions, from the extreme to the subtle, i.e. Islam atrocities to anti gay, anti-abortion Christians
@HlLLARY @retrosher #GOP/#RWNJs could never politically assassinate PBO, he has done well outsmarting them. @HillaryClinton will too.
@qb_ramirez Bigotry is byproduct of racism, I was raised to never have either. Only one I've known to "obliterate" is Iran, Hamas, all talk.
@GallSueJoe That's politics, they became allies once he became Prez, and him choose her as SOS. I'm going to work like Hell to get her in 17
#WhyImNotVotingForHillary, but I am Grasshopper, I am. She is a survivor/intellect from anything #GOP/#RWNJs throws at her for last 20yrs.
@qb_ramirez I've no racism for "those Jews", it's the govt policies I can't stand. As far as Iran, remember it's P5 + 1, all having experts.
@JeffreyGuterman No may about it, have you looked what's offered in the #GOP/#RWNJs camps. PBO has made me Hopeful &amp; Confident, #Hillary2016

He's such a jerk, lying to get voted in, and has the gall to make trouble.
@WindsorDw My pleasure, I like your thinking for sure. :)
Excellent conclusion. PBO has more class in his pinky than @SenJohnMcCain overall #pathetic #p2 #Democrats  
Lousy #media was calling PBO a lame duck, wrong again #pundits, he's still rocking all the way until #Hillary2016. 

anyone still terrified of North Korea ? 
Excellent, put that bitter old warmonger in his place. Kudos to you @BarackObama and @JohnKerry #p2 #Democrats  
@Maggyw519 @nytimes @HillaryClinton team should recall what happen when #Democrats ran away from PBO, no credit for anything, we got smoked.


#thereisnosexyway to battle wits with #GOP/#rwnj, no hold barred, go for the jugular with Truth on your side. #p2 #Democrats #UniteBlue
The pandering #GOP/#RWNJs at the #NRA demeaned her because #Hillary2016 a threat to them. Same spew they had for PBO 
Perfectly stated. 
@progressive4u2
…
Lot of variables in the mix, i.e have #Democrats win a comfortable majority. With #GOP in Power, we're stuck.   
Now it's bad mouth @HillaryClinton, won't work. Recall all the lies PBO got which never panned out, Remind #media. 
PBO is being proactive, not digressive. Americans have dealt with #Netanyahu for awhile, with his disrespect and all 
Turn the faucet off or down, hampering Egypt's aid, and keep on bugging the Hell out of them. #Mohamed_Soltan free. 
@YardrepShortbus @WillAFadel Sounds like run around with nothing done. I'm glad you were putting up the challenges. We need vote reform. #p2
#Gunners #NRA #GOP/#RWNJs they never consider unpredictability Millions of guns with 0 assurances, use cars as model 
Teddy Kennedy was the "Lion of the Senate", she is the "Lioness of the Senate" Great advocate for the common person. 
If I recall correctly, a #Sheik from Dubai is top shareholder of #FoxNews, I would bet my last $ he has Murdoch ears 
LOL What a well written dialogue after he was nailed. TY for share, pretty funny. :) 
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats back PBO, it's ironic saw a poll where Americans want Congress involved, when they suck. 
Perfect definition What I don't understand is @RollingStone is hammered for fudging rape case, yet Fox lies away?  
A very moving meme. If that doesn't open ones eyes, you don't know ramifications of war, or don't care, #GOP/#RWNJs  
Good one, Kim. Fits perfectly. :) 
Great news, now follow the leader "too-big-to-fail" banks, GE caught on, you should too. @SenWarren kudos to you too 
Patience will prevail, this is one baby step in it's long journey towards Justice.  
Excellent job explaining the #NRA, couldn't believe after Sandy Hook 80% want more gun control, and 36% favored NRA. 
@Team_LIBer8 I watched PBS documentary about Teddy, he was quite the progressive. My tweet was about the environmentalist he was, none today
LOL Businesses would want reimbursed, plus they'd tell @GOP/#RWNJs to take the funds from senior citizens, callous.  
Done TY for the share, I'll be watching, and good luck. :) 
Our hyperindividualistic culture created an isolated disconnected …
Maybe it's the #GOP/#RWNJ mantra "you're on your own" sinking in, or "blame govt for your problems" It boggles me. 
@MichaelSkolnik I wonder who in loony land will be first to call PBO a Communist sympathizer, hint: gotta be on #FoxNews where loons roam.
Voter apathy is an embarrassment, funny how it never concerns them a no vote means #GOP/#RWNJs win, rule, the agony  
#GOP/#RWNJs will never speak about it, #media should put it out there more. #Benghazi tragic is investigated History 
Yes, I wish we were more #UniteBlue than we claim to be, Hell I'm still fumed #Democrats laziness in last election. 
TYVM Valerie, #peace to all, be well be safe. :)

It'd be definitely different, easier when we have #democrats rule, Oregon. Plus #GOP/#RWNJs wants voter suppression  
However, the party in power at the time gets to draw the …
TY Will I'll check it out, I don't want to make excuses, but the voting climate was different, plus PBO was green. 
Hypocrisy at it's best, typical #GOP/#RWNJs Just like wanting to drill in @USFWSRefuges/#Arctic Despite T Roosevelt  
#GOP/#RWNJs have big 1% businesses on a high pedal-stool thus protecting them from regulations to force change. Deny 
@WillAFadel @MaxFMills Isn't it done every 10 years by whatever party rules, I believe that's why #GOP/#RWNJs were able to control situation
@MaxFMills @WillAFadel We desperately need #election/voter reforms, look to #Oregon as template. I'm afraid it won't happen until D's rule.
@FredChristian10 #peace to you too Fred, be well, be safe.

@BarackObama never was a coward, and walked out of any #media interview, he even went into the lions den #FoxNews  
1000's of Montanans lives saved despite the ones who died dragging your feet. The rest of Red States take note, move 
When was the last time a Cuban terrorist ran rampant across the world, time to #opencuba, start anew #p2 #Democrats  
Cool, a red state doing the correct action, it's very rare. Now to get them to rid themselves of unemphatic laws. 
@bpolitics @MarkHalperin Just another seed of doubt, many other more prevalent reasons are why she'll be are next Prez, and Bloomberg knows.
Many forget #MarcoRubio wrote the Senate immigration bill which PBO was cool with, but Boner killed, #media wake up. 
I want us to make History once again, by electing @HillaryClinton to the top job in which she deserves. Screw #GOP! 
@mhugolopez @upayr This is what white Republicans #GOP/#RWNJs fear the most, in my crystal ball, @replouiegohmert will be the last to go.
I can't believe that the immigration bill written by @marcorubio, then held up by @SpeakerBoehner, isn't good still. 
@iskandrah @OnlyTruthReign #shame on Israeli, #Westbank and #Gaza both treated as "contained hostages" in an open prison. #pathetic

From your lips/keyboard to the political Gods ears. We need more women in politics, it would only make us stronger.  

'Florida House Approves Bill To Let Adoption Agencies Refuse Gay Parents'

Absolutely student loans is heavy burden on the young man&amp;women, like having 2nd mortgage buying a house too. Reform 
When is"religion" under attack in this country, reminds me #GOP/#RWNJs closing abortion clinics due to a measurement 
@BruceBartlett @MichSolidarity They just love sensationalizing even the littlest string of a story, pull it, then blow it up. #media
LOL It's pretty cool, that in my dream for putting #GOP/#RWNJ out on their asses, is a stinger to you. Ah, truism. 
#ThingsBetterThanTheIranDeal would be make the nation all blue, put #GOP/#RWNJs in check, let #Democrats rock-n-roll on laws progressing. :)
@Ross_7_7 TYSM Lar, I enjoy are fight against #GOP/#RWNJ. Rock on! #peace
But who is out to derail it, please convince the other @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats to back our President, no mercy. 
"Somali of the United States", in other words "Big time Chaos" In my belief, Hilliary is going to get the expert nod 
True. I really don't see a consistent base out there, young ones, and strict libertarians wanting no govt at all. 
@Dowens8490 @Ross_7_7 Yes, Against the other clown #GOP/#RWNJs he sits right of right with few progressive ideas, can see him CIC, no way.
Underdeveloped Frontal lobe of the brain, decision making off, but education is suppose to massage it. Learn peeps. 
Hi Deb, good to see you. Missed the chats. Rand Paul is a phony, 18yrs college kids usually are infatuated, rebels.  
@kimby55 Yeah, cool belief, he definitely got hosed, out repairing his integrity. Must have really sucked working for GWB Inc. No honesty.
Rand is two faced as anything, and he can't handle press interviews, Whoa, wouldn't it be cool, a #maddow interview. 
I forgive him of his past Iraq/UN debacle, he now speaks Truth to Power especially at his fellow #GOP, easy to do. 
@TylerCullis @lrozen We know the Iran's past, now we have a pro and con relationship in ME. As far as speaking after post-deal, welcome it.

@TheObamaDiary This is a sure sign of greatness, take note #FoxNews and your dishonest #foxnewsfacts #liar
I can only Hope, the 10yr old busted the caveman #GOP/#RWNJ in front of all. Then I hope the people attending howled 
Classic example of delusional diatribe, if she were out in the ordinary, her family would be slapped a 304, fast. 
Kudos to the Hubble's "parents", her longevity is remarkable. Keep sending those awesome pics, to many more yrs.   
#Tennessee should be pointed out the lack of voter participation, causing ridicules #GOP/#RWNJ laws. Rise up! do it. 
@ezraklein @ThomasB00001 Simply put, go move PBO, transgender have it rough as it is, now let's watch how #GOP/#RWNJs responds, #pathetic
Really? He has so much baggage, very ignorant of Foreign policy, and a #kochsucker. Your loyalty is making you blind 
@thekarami @lrozen #Netanyahu is no go for #IranDeal, not enough, and nuke race will occur. Since #Israeli has nukes galore, Arabs are late.
I'm just going to thank my lucky stars that this present #congress wasn't around back then; scary thoughts. 
Equality #Texans! Damn, can't we give them back to Mexico? They did want to secede because of one of the great PBO. 
@RNicholasBurns Would have never happened with the Congress we have today, Thankfully it was timed just right in history. #IranDeal
@GeorgeCarpent11 @MaddowClub @maddow I agree, whenever I think of "red" all over the map particularly, I fume. #GOP/#RWNJ are so digressive.
@washingtonpost Whoa! Put your GWB/Cheney hard-ass imitation in check. Take a page from the great PBO, be cool Joe, be cool. We'll get there
@MaddowClub Watch Ms #maddow @maddow on replay, Love the way she brings out the hypocrisy&amp;idiocy of #Tennessee gun laws, with #NRA. Unreal.
@ggreenwald @davidsirota They're too damn good, making it all legal, just like money from ME nations, look all you want, nothing there.
@Ross_7_7 @cd5762 @GGevirtz As Ms #maddow @maddow would say, "watch this space"......definitely, the others too. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
Indeed. When he did use his military, it was well thought out, with limited soldiers. i.e. OBL. Not a warmonger. 
Quite the misery stew brewed by Roger Ailes. Inc, someday it'll dry up. #FoxNews #KellyFile  
I hope this will at least give @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats a second look at #Netanyahu's hypocrisy, his bloated ego  
@L0Bo_ Isn't that #FoxNews's Roger Ailes mantra, make all viewers blind&amp;dumb to the actual truth. Making fun of Harry Reid's injury is old.
It's been a helluva ride, thanks for allowing me to tag along. Congrats Bob Schieffer. 
Baby steps to equality, not fast enough, but we'll take it. TYVM @BarackObama  
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer Don't be dumb, don't be blind, you all need to look at your loyal base, PBO. 
@brontyman @NBCNews Life's hard, even harder when you're all cooped up 23 hrs/day, same thing day in day out until old age; Death is to easy
@kendall264 @countryzoner @CharlesMunn1 @realmcc1 @davidabatchelor Shhh.....The entity Satan lies in wait. :)
@thehill What blows my mind, many many thinks Congress sucks, yet they want Congress grubby hands all over #IranDeal. Irony. #WakeUpAmerica
@countryzoner @kendall264 @CharlesMunn1 @realmcc1 @davidabatchelor His 20yr old heart may live forever, but obviously his brain is spent.


I always thought #wisconsin voters were in the dark, electing  #GOP/#RWNJs in Power, I imagine a mute response here. 
I say PBO, a great president, needs to go rogue, go for a third term, make Dick Cheney/#RWNJs shit down both legs.  
Dick Cheney has a heart of a 20ish old, he could live forever, but with these false diatribes about Obama, it's evident his brain is going.
@Apocalypse451 @PirateWench @bossyhoneybee Doing it in the mirror, good. Don't want to show those weaknesses that dominate you. keep cool.
@JewishOdysseus @Apocalypse451 @PirateWench @bossyhoneybee Your arrogance amazes me, one thing I can't stand is a know-it-all, who's wrong.

@Apocalypse451 @PirateWench @bossyhoneybee Solid tweets, thank you Dan, unlike yours #RWNJs have Diarrhea of the mouth, running no substance
@Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus @PirateWench @pyteaparty @bossyhoneybee I'm thinking more Eisenhower idea, JFK enacted.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @marshallpalmer5  I swore to our country, but I stay to rid it of delusional #RWNJs ideas like you, your ilk.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus How did he do in the Prez race, landslide I believe. Dem's lacked #media sucked, no PBO credit
@PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee Yes, due to communist threat. LBJ got sucked in, with a unified Cong.
@JewishOdysseus @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @marshallpalmer5 More in line with GWB Inc stiring up the whole ME, funny you never mention it
@JewishOdysseus @PirateWench @pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee We may be in the majority, but GOP voted with what LBJ wanted.
@Apocalypse451  @PirateWench @pyteaparty @bossyhoneybee You are worthless, no challenge at all. Typical loser meme, projection only, read it
Exactly what to expect from #pathetic Conservative ideology court.  
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @marshallpalmer5 @JewishOdysseus Dan boy, you better go chill Twitter to hot for you. Woods needs move Yemen.
@JewishOdysseus @PirateWench @pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee I give Tricky Dick is comings, but #GOP was also to blame for war.
@PirateWench @pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 Yes, tough turnaround in our lifetime, just have to #GetMoneyOut all we can.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus You're the one with the "L" branded on your head, plus you're a liar. Won't get you anywhere.
@JewishOdysseus @PirateWench @pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee He started the EPA too.
@bossyhoneybee @marshallpalmer5 @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus Your admiration for people of "influence" sign nothing in between your ears.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus I'm fine, you all are the #pathetic #GOP/#RWNJs. I'm amused by your meaningless diatribes.
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus Good source there, another known liar.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus Hardly, I've been battle you #RWNJ for years, I'm proud to be liberal until I die too. No lie.
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus Actually I see you as a sorry case, I just hope your confined, don't lie your way out. Scary..
@PeytonFed2014 @pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus Unity to fix problems would be awesome. No arguments.
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus But you don't believe in evolution, #RWNJs thinks the Earth is 6,000yrs old, lameness galore.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus It's obvious you have a "L" branded on your forehead for "Loser", you done lost again. :)
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus Your busted and weak, come on, you're a Cruz lover, everyone knows he's an idiot. Cuckoo, UU.
@pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus #pathetic Who has been withholding resources to vets...#GOPHatesvets
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus I see what your doing, ole call in reinforcements by retweeting me, can't handle me one on one
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee  I utilize many sources, it's hardly a talking point it's truth, you all are waiting for "Heavens Gate" ship.
@pyteaparty @Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Who you kidding, every mess we ever faced, D's cleaned up
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus With her being the only D in primary, she'll win that up against any wacko #GOP/#RWNJs up.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus #sad you don't know you've been taken, you've been spoon fed propaganda, #FoxNews one culprit.
@pyteaparty How can you teach when nothings there? I've seen the ole "childish" remarks, it's an ole #RWNJ tactic, it's a waste.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus She will smoke what runs against her. You're eating out the wrong trench, never mind, stay.
@pyteaparty You're sleepy, have mommy powder your rump, maybe tomorrow you'll make sense.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu Even though it goes against all your repressed convictions with #GOP, you're a liar.
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus I'm not the one on Cruz bandwagon, you're loonier enough to think he will win. #pathetic
@pyteaparty Your stench of arrogance is stinking, you don't even know me, I know you, teabagger, you can't think for yourself, #pathetic
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @JewishOdysseus Your like a broken record, they say memory is first to go......Cruz lover, bury your head.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench  @pari_passu I bet it's tough for you living in SF amongst gay society; having to lie constantly.
@bossyhoneybee @Apocalypse451 @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Hey Cruz lover keep your day job. I see the bigot #RWNJs are anti-gay
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Quit talking in you mirror then, run away! Time for my girl #maddow
@bossyhoneybee @2AmendDefender @JewishOdysseus Even Hitler believed his own propaganda, maybe #RWNJs correlation is head trauma as child.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu LOL Getting us towards single payer, judges filibustered, peace v war
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Every time you #GOP/#RWNJs mess up nation, we have to clean the mess.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Give me examples of what you see as "radicalism"?
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Hardly, Obama's two wins were historical, #media was in #GOP pocket.
@2AmendDefender @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Of course, because you root for a #pathetic #sad party, surely hide.
@Apocalypse451 @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu I'm not denying we lost big time, fact D's didn't show, other issues
@bossyhoneybee @DewCrewpgss @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Are you really a Cruz fan.....excuse me while I laugh an hour or so.
@2AmendDefender @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu You bet on worthless #GOP/#RWNJs, your creds zero. Speak I here!
@bossyhoneybee @DewCrewpgss @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Just because you don't understand, don't make fools out of your buds.
@2AmendDefender @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu I been fighting with #RWNJs long time, you're like yesterday's trash
@DewCrewpgss @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Glad it pinched a little #RWNJ, my pleasure.
@2AmendDefender @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Go for it #RWNJ, happy to oblige. Burn your candles.....
@DewCrewpgss @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu I could say the same about your avatar, let alone your #RWNJ status.
@bossyhoneybee @2AmendDefender @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu I see all the #RWNJ children out speaking their tiny little minds.
@JewishOdysseus Hardly, I'm not surprised you know nothing about an "equal playing field for all" You rather have plutocracy, cut 1% taxes.
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu Pulling "facts" out of you ass, don't make it true. PBO has reduced the size of govt
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu What? Never heard of delegating authority, you #RWNJs make out to be bad, nonsense.
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu PBO has done well by me, even when you #TinFoil hats throw everything at him. Kudos!
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu I know you have more respect for #Netanyahu than PBO, No war Bibi, #GOPWantsWar, no!
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu and the whole world behind him. NK knows not to piss around. You're itching for war.
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu What's Putin done lately, PBO forced ceasefire? NK? Remember NK nuked up on GWB rule
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu I swear if #GOP/#RWNJs had brain, be dangerous, bad enuf we deal with childlike acts
@bossyhoneybee It's true, you think putting a #GOP in office the world would be quiet. GWB Inc. blew 9/11, FU Iraq for decades, #GOPWantsWar
@bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu If you knew anything about policy, Putin is quiet, NK is quiet, and Iran is nukeless
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu Look again. I have to run to store, I look for you all later.
@bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu Hardly, maybe you rather have war. #GOPWantsWar Go say it to your mirror.
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu I would'nt beat my chest, with a 37% turnout. D's gave it to you, which sucks now.
@bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu You look like a woman, funny how your against a Constitutional law for women. #sad
@bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus @PirateWench @pari_passu @tracyealy1 
Talk about immature chatter, you only wish i was an idiot. Grow up!
@bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @JewishOdysseus @pari_passu You're blowing smoke out your ears, your party dying off, every year, you hate it.
@bossyhoneybee @JewishOdysseus @PirateWench @pari_passu @tracyealy1 
Due to cuts/obstructions funding, #GOPWantsWar then smuck them.
He says he loves the "God of Israeli" weird teachings to laugh at old man's spill. I suggest you go God shopping.  
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu @tracyealy1 
He's old as dirt, and took a spill; unemphatic? Like GOP towards vets.
@JewishOdysseus @bossyhoneybee @PirateWench @pari_passu @tracyealy1 Hell, tin hatters wouldn't know #reality if came up and bit you on tush.
Talk about misguided priorities, Wake up #Tennessee @Tennessean your legislators are wacky, keep REAL guns the issue 
Now getting them to vote, along with  the rest of #Democrats.   

@andendall @Lifeisloveamar I say sic @columbiajourn on their asses, weeding out failures, false info, misinformation at @FoxNews easy street
@KellyO @SenJohnMcCain Watch for banana peels.
@sasha3taylor @JamiaStarheart @DaleF3 @crooksandliars @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats GOP are definitely against PBO, racism? Absolutely. #p2
@sasha3taylor @JamiaStarheart @DaleF3 @crooksandliars @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats I don't believe he's racist, he's Jewish, sides Israeli??
@sasha3taylor @JamiaStarheart @DaleF3 @crooksandliars @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Strange Ranger; Going against PBO #IranDeal, think again.
@sasha3taylor @JamiaStarheart @DaleF3 @crooksandliars @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats I'm still fuming when D's in Congress ran from PBO in 14'.
@awhawth @tcwittes I'm sure PBO didn't sugar-coated it, while maintaining Hopefulness. Time has swallowed up any reminisce of a stable govt.
@sasha3taylor @JamiaStarheart @DaleF3 @crooksandliars @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Indeed. Why peeps want GOP Congress involved is beyond me.
@andreajmarkley @beckert70 Great meme. In essence, in a pubic way, PBO has told #Netanyahu #GOPWantsWar it's my way. @SenateDems #Democrats
Educate yourself American; Approval of GOP ruled Congress is very low, yet many want them to butt in PBO #IranDeal! @SenateDems #Democrats.
@Doranimated @BenWeinthal BS You're just a critic, if he didn't explain you'd nail him for that too. He's educating peeps, follow along. #p2

Its time for VOTING to be Mandatory &amp; be declare a Holiday
@TheDemocrats 
(link] 
I'm quite confused.....Pew,62% of Americans Want Congress to Have Final Say on Iran Deal, even though Congress stinks 
@thejaoana @TheRReport Pres. Teddy Roosevelt rolling in his grave as #GOP/#RWNJs are stepping on his strong environment convictions. #p2
@TheFix "The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking." #FoxNews failures having been going for years
@keriRN I guess I'd need copies of #GOP nincompoops faces, DNC handbook, and tomato juice to remove the smell from the copies, then guess :)
@keriRN Toughest part of parenting I think, that point where you have to let live, then we worry nonstop about them. Being hopeful is vital.
@keriRN Yes, remember the movie The "Exorcist" Satan and #GOP/#RWNJs they're interchangeable. :)
@keriRN I'm a part-time political exorcist on Craig's List, need help, just shout. :) A Mom's gospel is usually heartfelt, you'll do fine.
@keriRN Congrats. I'm sure they've adopted Mom's liberal progressive ideology. :) My whole family is liberal, I had it easy. My Son is 23.
@keriRN Quiet, threw a ham loaf in, it was just me and my Son, reminisce of Easter's past, kid was spoiled. Got many heartwarming calls. :)
 #NoMoreGOPWar 
@keriRN TY for the share, two very smart men discussing world events, can't beat it. Hope you and yours had a happy day. :)
@kimmie8264 @novenator He quibbles about the Iranian deal will start a nuke race in ME, seems with Israeli having nukes they'd start already
@upayr @HTheCam @RealDwneastDiva @AdvChaser It's very #pathetic, what's funnier is PBO ain't done, and Hilliary is up to bat. #GOP ineptness
@azannaphx @AJDiLiddo @robin182zz What confuses me so is the electorate has vast resources to understand the issues, yet are inactive. #vote

#UniteBlue 
@UniteBlueME @UniteBlue Typical #GOP/#RWNJ reaction, negativity and fear-mongering. There is no circumstances that would praise PBO. None.
@Nupe117 @SharonKyle00 @cspanwj I believe 60ish% of American (Pew) thinks Congress should "approve" PBO's #IranDeal. Are you sure America?
@JamiaStarheart @DaleF3 @crooksandliars Good analysis, for all the weary @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats. #Netanyahu is blowing smoke, #GOP too
@mitchellreports I've heard many for the #IranDeal, and those against. It's definitely a historic event, a China-Nixon deal. I believe PBO.
@WestWingReport @pinkbunny70 An iconic image for the ages.
@phemale61 Classic. TY for share.

@politico @ImpactDemocracy "62 percent want Congress to have the final say over any agreement." from Pew, All the more to educate peeps.
@starfirst So many independent groups have investigated Benghazi finding no hidden agendas. Trust secured, same can be said for #IranDeal

@BillKristol You have been wrong on every major event in our lifetime, and your wrong again. Neocons like yourself words are meaningless.
@Bipartisanism @AlisonSpalding2 Throw in little fascism, plutocracy, "you're on your own" mentality, it's easy to see #GOP/#RWNJ is failure.
@TheBaxterBean @DaleF3 #NorthDakota these are the heartless unemphatic self-righteous degenerates you have voted in. Wear your badge well.
@soxfaneast: Jon Stewart nails it! 
@albhere LOL Tempur-Pedic mattress used I'm sure.
#IranDeal 
@Bipartisanism I also remember US-supported jihad against the Soviet Union that led to the rise of Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda. PBO is legit.
@crazylary51 @dailykos I take PBO's word, backed by six other nations, that this deal with Iran is the best possible considering all. #p2
@CoralKittyCat @zbleumoon @MotherJones #sad tough life, reminds me when I was living in Philly, the homeless slept on subway vents keep warm
@blackdoris23 @BDBgoldens3 @ggreenwald I believe in American exceptional, take it to my grave, yet realistic enough we ain't perfect either.
@BDBgoldens3 @ggreenwald Yes, all educated via the US system, yes the theocracy rules the day, you'd think intellectualism would prevail.
@ggreenwald @BDBgoldens3 They're not that smart if they continue to live under that regime. I'll take PBO's team, I've been impressed so far
@Marypop987 @SheripetersonS @kavn Indeed, education is our best investment for generations to come, and we must start now. #GOP/#RWNJs lame.

@Marypop987 @SheripetersonS @kavn It's that good ole #GOP/#RWNJ economic philosophy of trickle down BS. #Kansas should've booted him. #p2
@keriRN @cd5762 TYVM Keri, it's an impressive time, just as big when Nixon went to China, if not bigger. I just other peeps saw it as such.
@keriRN @cd5762 Anything to place the spotlight on the #GOP/#RWNJs constant attempts in eroding the nation and our people. #Democrats #p2
@Harriet_W_W @NeilStandish LOL Why wait, start haunting them today. :)

@nprnews @CampbellsSoup7 @SenTomCotton @MarkLeibovich @nprpolitics I wonder if he thinks, "if this baker thinks I'm gay, I won't get a cake"
@phemale61 Liberals are persuasive enough, not as bullheaded as GOP, in end, they will do what's best. I get more fumed at stay at home D's
@williamsmjw @RohdeD Barbarism runs deep in the Middle East, it could be said the US does the same when we pump inmates with poison.
@bjs5555 Come on #Florida give it up for Adam, we don't need another #GOP/#RWNJ in Power. @VISITFLORIDA #Democrats #p2  Please RT in Florida
@Omid_M Crazy how to America it's a yawn, even though it's not, it's historic, Iranians are partyin like it's 1999. PBO Inc has done well.
@MJanovic @TammaraMaiden1 They're simpletons enough to donate it all to the Ted Cruz for President fund or other waste.
@MattyIceAZ @Bipartisanism So used to the "my way, or the highway" mentality. A leftover of the GW days.
@teigland_cindy Yet another law making abortion more strict no matter circumstances courtesy of local #GOP/#RWNJ religious philosophy.

@MsRock4Ever I side with nuke/political experts from six countries on how to disarm Iran, playing politics is deeply irresponsible #IranDeal
@Flirtyphilly @jeffl76 @thinkprogress Way to go #Vermont, anything to promote, easy access to voting. Kudos. #votingmatters #voting #vote
@theonlyadult @pinkbunny70 @joshtpm I'll take the nuclear/political expertise of six countries to disarm Iran than an editorial board whim.

@PureMitten @markknoller Liberals are always there to clean the messes the #GOP/#RWNJs leave our nation in. Clean up crew.
@PureMitten @markknoller Your ideology is on a withering vine, hijacked by loons, demographics decreasing, hope to see it's last flicker
@PureMitten @markknoller Nope, one thing for sure in this life, never trust a #GOP/#RWNJ their DNA is to lie, yes even about vets. Try again
@PureMitten @markknoller How can you speak or think rational, with such a closed up mind, along with no hopeful aspirations. #pathetic.
@PureMitten @markknoller that war GW Inc achieved has much blood on everyone's hands, but I've never really saw evidence it happen, GOP talk
@PureMitten @markknoller Juvenile is point, this is about the here and now, to give this deal any way of working is open mind, not closed.
@PureMitten @markknoller Not speaking in 30 some years, I wouldn't call it "Horrible History", spin it anyway, your spitefulness is juvenile
@Njeanous @americans4amer You are right one, I'd throw #media in the mix too. But like you said, being united is what it's all about, &amp; vote
@Njeanous @americans4amer Absolutely Njean, we got burned by many of us staying home last election, #GOP/#RWNJs rule heartless and ridicules
@rinkydnk2
@americans4amer Welcome to the truly open wide tent where diversity is known to make us stronger. Welcome to the heart of the people, nation
@PureMitten @markknoller Time will definitely tell, but history has been made, no denying that, pessimism, fear-mongering, will do nothing.
@BuzzFeedNews @AP My next question would be How? and I'd wait patiently, no fear-mongering spin either.
@PureMitten @markknoller Right Wing Nut Job, very handy acronym. This is a historical day, made by PBO, gotta give credit to the man.
@PureMitten @markknoller Dems will follow the lead of PBO, maybe some ruffle, but in the end nothing like inept #GOP/#RWNJs, it's spite.
@PureMitten @markknoller I understand fully no "actual" deal yet. #RWNJs/#GOP will never be satisfied either way, that's despise for PBO.
@PureMitten @markknoller Hardly the backstabbers the #GOP/#RWNJs are. No way Dems will want more sanctions after this ground breaking event.
#IranTalks
@JohnKerry @MacBethSpeaks Great Job to all, TYSM.
@southerntalker @alinatede @JohnKerry Yes, 2006 was his year, but the BS "Swift Boat" lies dominating the gullible. It's a good thought T.
@JesusWife @LaCina52 Did he every say, "I'm going down to play some Blackjack." #ThingsJesusNeverSaid
@markknoller Give credit where credit is due, #RWNJs/#GOP, nothing to legibility whine about this time. #pathetic

@AngieinWAState Good one Angie, that they would. :)
@intenseCA The Art of Wheel and Deal. I entrust her though.
@TheFix I like "unprecedented verification", there goes #GOP/#RWNJs #Netanyahu fear-mongering card out the window.
@scarylawyerguy @OnlyTruthReign and it burns them every minute too, it eats #GOP/#RWNJs up too. #happy #Democrats #p2
#IranDeal
@Sttbs73 @SenTomCotton He still has a big "L" on his forehead, "Loser"! I can be so juvenile sometimes.....:)
@politico @suekhi Let's all watch see how vicious #GOP/#RWNJs, their leader #Netanyahu will be over Nuke deal. Let the fear-mongering begin.
@intenseCA They are explaining it as "give a little, take a little" kind of budget move. Seems like Planned Parenthood, NARAL have been mute
@MaxCUA @usedtobgop @JOBoomr @MonroeG5 @attilatheblond @sweetnonnie I don't want to live in "you're on your own" world, The needy exists.
@irin Smart article. It seems the #GOP squeeze on less access for Constitutionally protected abortions, more feticide cases could increase?
@MaxCUA @usedtobgop @JOBoomr @MonroeG5 @attilatheblond @sweetnonnie So what is the solution?
@MaxCUA @usedtobgop @JOBoomr @MonroeG5 @attilatheblond @sweetnonnie Did you actually read the entire article? GOP Great Recession still felt
@MaxCUA @usedtobgop @JOBoomr @judynbea @MonroeG5 @attilatheblond @sweetnonnie I don't believe Worldnet stats you use, #GOP ideas are lame.
@Joyce_Karam @20committee I will bet my last buck, #GOP/#RWNJs, #Netanyahu won't be satisfied in the least with whatever the deal produces.
@MaxCUA @usedtobgop @JOBoomr @judynbea @MonroeG5 @attilatheblond @sweetnonnie Massive population, GOP is zero help, cutting social programs.
@CandaceTX @thepoliticalcat There was a time #GOP/#RWNJs made a really big deal about "Flip-Floppers" how things have change. #hypocrisy

RFRA law may cost state over $256 m --- WAY TO GO @GovPenceIN &amp; Racist Klan


@Mythicmaster @andendall LOL I've been following his ideology, definitely primitive. I'm really happy he's on the other side. :)
@Sarah__Reynolds @cwclub @Chevron @AmazonWatch I've always enjoyed your tweets. :)

Bigotry is all around me

@Kalaax008 @kelownascott @CletisStump A hard part of life that's for sure, the misfortunes of life, although sad, it forces our eyes open.
@sommervillebbc @OnlyTruthReign Two issues, no sense getting sloppy if #ISS is still perking up their heads. Who will hold Shiite or Iraq?
@Kalaax008 @kelownascott @CletisStump Something tells me the apple does not fall far from the tree.&lt;3 My family is big, love is like DNA. :)

@darlene09465021 Main thing to realize is laws like these are written by notorious anti-#LGBT lobbyist in every red state, and ALEC behind.
@Kalaax008 @kelownascott @CletisStump Touched. Mine was a little Mexican woman, hunchbacked, so adorable. I was 17 when she passed. Loving.
@Kalaax008 @kelownascott @CletisStump Full of love Diva, full of love....TY for opening a memory. :)
Only moral ever needed
@kelownascott @Kalaax008 @CletisStump Indeed, it should be remembered like tying our shoes, that automatic.

@TheKnowledge You're making it callous, unemphatic, but you are correct that it will be hitting this nation as an issue, make it peaceful.
@CletisStump @Kalaax008 It's too bad it's not as simplistic as  "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you," What a world.........

@BDBgoldens3 @JNovak_Yemen TY :)
@BDBgoldens3 @JNovak_Yemen Turkey has trouble with Kurds, PPK in particular, fighting since 80's I believe. Over independence, yep, mess too
@BDBgoldens3 @JNovak_Yemen Please share, Ukraine is a whole different animal. Putin is on a Power trip, even up in the Arctic.
@BDBgoldens3 @JNovak_Yemen I really feel for Kurds, they're so nationalistic, ethically proud, yet mind their own business, and want land.
@BDBgoldens3 @JNovak_Yemen Indeed, it's terrible to say, I hate war, but maybe it would act as a self cleansing of sort. Iraq divided in 3?
@BDBgoldens3 @JNovak_Yemen Is such a mess over there, seems the only time Saudi Arabia and other Sunnis step up if it's Shiites. ISSI/Sunnis
@JNovak_Yemen @BDBgoldens3 In other words, AQ Sunnis breaking out other AQ Sunni's for the battle against the Shiite Houthi rebels........

@torqueflite @GovPenceIN And one more crucial things, many people agree with you, can't stop that. Congrats. :)
@torqueflite @GovPenceIN Setbacks for sure, but like you said, you come a long way, and it's looking much better, not ideal, but no 80's. :)
@MagicalEarth Being the optimistic I am, catering to the #RWNJs will be their downfall as usually. Just look a Iowa, the craziness...WOW! :)

@torqueflite @GovPenceIN and sadly they are is every state, particularly the Red ones, holding hands with ALEC too. We have much work too do
@MagicalEarth His priority was to cozy up to the wacko anti-gay lobbyists who created this discriminatory law, and happy to sign it. #idiot
@torqueflite @GovPenceIN The source is those anti-gay lobbyist behind Pence in their photo-op who crafted this law, no why getting round it.
@ryangrim I never liked it much giving Israel weapons as they ravaged Gazi either, when men, women, and children were killed. A lame excuse.
@Lori_Nalette @shar76 Political arrogance, typical #GOP trait.

@UniteBlueMo2016 @riwired I don't agree with #HAMAS threats, they have no Power to defeat #Israel. There was a war all #Arabs vs Israel won.

@riwired @GOP @UniteBlueMo2016 I believe when the going gets tough, #America is deeply nationalistic.LOL true about the #GOP/#RWNJs.
@riwired @UniteBlueMo2016 #Palestinians urn for Nationalism, just like #Israel have. Hardly "talking points", more like the #truth. #mistake
@UniteBlueMo2016 @riwired I just think Israel policies suck, #Netanyahu governs like #GOP/#RWNJ #GOPWantsWar, #GAZA like Gitmo, like prison.
@riwired @UniteBlueMo2016 @BarackObama They have us, and they have a Hellva defense system, nukes too at their finger tips. Policy is hatred

@BDBgoldens3 @SpudLovr @ScottWalker Good point, I bet #Wisconsin #Democrats are regretful too for staying home, much like on national level.
@jojokejohn I'm more optimistic, if #Democrats wake up to vote, #GOP/#RWNJs will lose the Power we gave them last election. #liberals vote.
@BDBgoldens3 @SpudLovr Why #Wisconsin #voters were duped three times, giving Power to @ScottWalker is beyond me, on top of #RWNJs rule in DC

@granitevoter I can see that, I see it as achieving self goals, that why I said interchangeable, sometimes even achieving hitting both goals
@granitevoter Absolutely, good point. I remember in 80's "Welfare Queens" was big, tons of children, home eating bonbons #GOP/#RWNJs lied.
Gunner in Mesa, AZ. diehard #gunnuts, never bring unpredictability in account, no assurances, that's why car insurance is needed @EndNRA
@granitevoter To me it seems we need a mixture, "pulling your weight" meaning chipping in, "fending for yourself" make do for self goals?
@voxdotcom #GOP/#RWNJs philosophy will be withering on the vine because whites will be a minority status, maybe that will result in harmony.
@NationalMemo Funny how mums the word, usually #GOP/#RWNJs to circle the wagons, and blow it off, even #FoxNews are pretty silent. Busted!
@granitevoter Aren't they interchangeable, alone we have dualism, but you need a equal balance of both.

@FOXXXXFIRE5 @FavThngs @politicususa Give #GOP/#RWNJs Hell with facts @BarackObama Their bill is filled Deprive, Deny, just more destruction
@HuffPostPol He's 74, continues to have Frontal Lobotomy smarts, it hasn't caused him to kill in prison, he's institutionalized, let live
@SenSanders @cd5762 He's no doubt rolling in his grave in how the #GOP/#RWNJs have gone far wacky lying right in the present. #Pathetic #sad
@JustBob15 @DaleF3 @Green_Footballs True a great debate in 08' amongst #Democrats, but PBO demonstrated change was needed more so. #vote2016
@JustBob15 @DaleF3 @Green_Footballs I'm for a vigorous primary, but possibly fellow #Democrats out of respect have given her a clear WH path
@055Douglas Scary pic, looks like great portray of evil. He believes since he was a POW, he's gets a pass for any delusion he spews. #lies
@soxfaneast @larrymasonbiz @HuffPostRelig Baby steps, but we're moving toward the ultimate goal of pure acceptance. Change is movable always
@WarAgainstWomen Now it's women, a couple weeks ago, bigot Brownback stripped #LGBT protections in workplace. Kansans voted Dems before?????
@americans4amer @wildwestleft Like the great liberal, Ted Kennedy was known as the "Lion of the Senate, she filled his shoes, "the Lioness"
@robin182zz You don't really want to wish life to speed up, but this #GOP/#RWNJs rule in this case I do. Irony, it's our fault too. #vote
@MEClosets @CindyLeinwand12 @lawrenceangbk @JJManring He was busted for being a #liar in 14' election ISSI and Mex cartel were coming to AR.
#UniteBlue
@gradrn2 @mterry337 @Gift2USA I place him in irrelevant camp, much like #giuliani, both #corrupt &amp; speak outrageous BS, to stay in #media
@Elizrael @rulajebreal Russia's media is own/operated by Putin Inc. US #media towed 14 election for #GOP PBO was bashed/no credit. #corrupt
@EleRhinoMarch @_AnimalAdvocate Galling, and they are very intellectual beings, it's torture plain and simple. #sad #pathetic #disturbing
@kaylama54674519 @ludditeViv Pretty bad when ants know the importance of working together for a single goal, and #GOP cannot. #p2 #Democrats
@CallOut4 He should've been in an institution long ago due to his frontal lobotomy, in a structure environment, he gets the care. Let live.
@HuffPostPol He reminded us about needing voter participation after a dismal 37% turnout, as the populist in him, it's "Power to the People"
@occupythemob @byronNME Excellent #Oregon, may you become the nation's voter pilot program, #GOP holds Power, they like to suppress voting.
@viciousbabushka @retrosher @PrettyFootWoman #GOP will never change their spots. Reminds me of not giving active duty BP vests in Iraq. #sad
@raggapegs When the 14' election showed only 37% turnout, and #Democrats were no shows, I just knew these days abound, #GOP can never govern
@PolitiDitz As an ole pro-science liberal, I'm always fighting for you. Millennials need to vote, and collectively we'll get rid of GOP rule
@CBSEveningNews @juliannagoldman @CBSNews Just another political assassination attempt by #media. You think HRC would allow vulnerability?
@blakehounshell @MERRYMAJESTY He's a @BillKristol lying protege, it doesn't surprise me one bit. #p2 #Democrats #pathetic BS.
@themainepain @ginou1010 Instead of causing division they don't use time to feed children, troubled vets, erasing poverty. Heartless dweebs
@TheObamaDiary @HHooversGhost Don't look this way Israeli on how to vote, voter apathy by #Democrats last election resulted in #GOP rule.
@BeschlossDC @pinkbunny70 What could have been.......
@jupiter896 With all the crap #GOP/#RWNJs/#foxnews has thrown at him, he's a brilliant President standing. #Democrats must still unite. #p2
@BrookingsInst Everything #GOP is dead against, their Power is to divide, digress, and destroy, they fear the change coming. #p2 #Democrats
@Valerie0714 TY for the share. Done. Confirmed. Looking ahead, what sweet Justice if the next petition to house them in Gitmo. :) #Democrats
@jameshohmann @JFKucinich That's opening up the #GOP/#RWNJs playbook of fear-mongering, maybe rejuvenate the teabaggers, surprise, no way.
The #GOP destroys a nation simply out of Obama hate... day after day.
#47trai…
@Kuku_Sabzi @starfirst I urn for harmony, it's just a shame we can't get on the train of, "more perfect Union" More voter participation key.
@daudig @AdamSerwer Throw it in the same bucket of BS as no perp walks for rich, and peasants are hit with racist arrests. i.e. #Ferguson.
@starfirst #GOP/#RWNJs is hardly thriving for a "more perfect Union", quite the opposite. More like destruction, divide, and digress agenda.
@pharris830 @theodoricofyork Shame upon those that help result in a 37% turnout, now we pay the consequences with #GOP/#RWNJs in power. #p2
@daveweigel Next stop, Iran........he must sign the #47Traitors letter. Good luck Chuck. #pathetic #idiot
@ZekeJMiller @terri_georgia @EvanMcSan He polished his ego so much he's blind to reality. How the raising #GOP star is dimming. #p2 #corrupt
@Bipartisanism @NaYaKnoMi We have to bust our balls to elect her a #Democrats majority in 16'. Otherwise we have to live under #GOP rule.
@MotherJones @CcriderJohn That's what happens when #GOP/#RWNJs keep throwing jello at the "destroy Obama" wall, and nothing sticks. Go Obama


@ARTSYJUDITH Wow....I wonder how #foxnews anchors or #GOP/#RWNJs hold their "great" leader now? #pathetic
@CNNPolitics @StCollinson We have to remember the US is not alone at this nuke dance, With PBO's smarts, he's not going to leave it short.
@ron_fournier Wouldn't surprise me, they're no doubt wishing for more ways to ruin the nation. #SavetheUnion #p2 #Democrats #pathetic
@jimmacpam Typical #GOP/#RWNJs lack of feelings, no empathy, 0, Nada, they're motivated by sheer destruction of peoples lives', govt itself.

@TheBaxterBean @p_staatz This's a concentrated effort, Cotton is from a duped red state, this lying wannabe didn't come up with this himself
@SusanMaylone @FavThngs Exactly, last 37% turnout election gave us the #GOP dominated Congress, We have to deal with their #bullshitness now
@RepublicanSwine @AJDiLiddo They wear many hats for destruction. :(
@Politolizer @mterry337 The #media should be characterizing him for what he is, a #Liar i e Mexican cartel and ISSI crossing the border yet?
@2_Synnseer @DanteB4u A new demand: Since warrants were issued in a racist climate, void the non-violent warrants only. Clean slate time.
@tackettdc @ehuetteman It's sad they use her as a political pawn. Once again holding Americans hostage because of an anti-abortion provision
@redhed67 @LilMsgss @SenateGOP @TomCotton @joniernst @SenatorLankford @jiminhofe Probably an insert with the letter. Spot on, Great toon.
@dbowermanroth @MaddowClub @Salon Malicious and callous. #pathetic
The Iranian FM, Javad Zarif called #47Traitors letter a "propaganda scheme" seems like that is the lying core of #GOP with #FoxNews pushing.
#GOPwantsWAR
#47Traitors
htt…
Good read: Iran's FM, chief negotiator, points out the foolish embarrassment by #47Traitors. 
@Valerie0714 Gladly done, and TY Valerie :)
@055Douglas @Gdad1 Since the whole damn country is red, state #GOP are out for it, discrimination laws based on "religious freedom" Hellbent

Time to push back. Hard. 

#47T…
@bravenewfilms @bmalcolm1 All for getting #Democrats to become actively involved in their politics, so we can free ourselves the #GOP burden
@Walkermatt16 @blakehounshell @bpolitics You realize you're backing the wrong horse. He's a phony, in this era, can't answer the evolution ?
@Bill_Lenner @ericawright3170 @jojokejohn Good point, I'm up for suggestion, we just hit the brick wall called the #GOP/#RWNJs, digression.

@jojokejohn Great tuber. TY #peace to you. :)
@ericawright3170 @jojokejohn Damn #GOP standing in the way, I swear their shenanigans are always out to burn, they want destruction. #sad
@ericawright3170 @jojokejohn Definitely reform needed, make it a federal day off, nation wide mail-in vote, expand ways rather than restrict
@XGirlNYC @JAPITTER @GothamKnight05 @susanmichael11 @princss6 @suzannah_mpls @brontyman @AllisonDono @DeniseFlores @randallr01 #peace to all
@ShmooReport Catering to the #GOP/#RWNJs fear that PBO is Messiah-like, @BarackObama would be riding that beast between shots......:)
DP sides with Iran hardliners like Cory G…
@AngryVoters @DaliDager @SenCoryGardner is teabagger who hurts common man, especially women rights, @denverpost is 1% rag, go figure.
@MarkGKirshner @PennDragonArt @RebelMouse Perfect depiction by Orwell, It's part of #GOP DNA to betray, all too often, we continue to expose
@Petrichor222 @frankdugan That seems it would be struck down via the Constitution. Medical personnel can't let some one bleed to death.

@andendall @thomasclark92 Keep holding his shenanigans in the light, eventually it will come around to bite him ass. Then we can rejoice.
@Team_LIBer8 @CSAresu #media can't prioritize unless they've an agenda like the cozy job with the #GOP in 2014 election. Remember they're 1%

@TNTweeters1 @mch7576 @EspuelasVox @HillaryClinton @thehill If PBO had confidence in her, so do I. Clintons are good peeps, always were. #p2
@WorkingClass101 @aaronschock Yes, handsome young man with 6pack abs. I think tapping in his PAC or campaign fund of $16,000 big no-no.
@WorkingClass101 @aaronschock This shining #GOP star is dimming out quickly. He's going be under a microscope here on out. #corrupt #p2
@kasie Good observation. Has anyone asked Jeb if he would have signed the #47Traitors letter if presented to him? #p2
@AmbassadorPower From your lips, finger tips, to the political Gods ears. :)
@SkyNews @brontyman Welcome to America, wish I can mean it, sadly weapons are so damn easy to possess. #peace to all affected.
