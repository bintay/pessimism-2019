@ZombieChurchUK @Thezombiechurch Always one of my favorites
@ChrisSimms77 Just when I thought I could not be more hyped for Cpt America Civil War....
@ChrisSimms77 Agreed, and I knew nothing about the actress going in and she was amazing
@linnieloowho @HorrorHoneys I was just at his site going OMG these figures are too much
@linnieloowho @HorrorHoneys I love them all, but oh my god that Angela my life seems meaningless knowing I dont have it
More Scarlet Witch just because #AvengersAgeOfUltron 
I loved Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch so so much #AddsToObsessionList #AvengersAgeOfUltron Also, need her clothes. 
I loved #AvengersAgeOfUltron. Except for the scenes at the barn. That was weird.  And awkward. But mostly weird.
@justajarhead Glad you are taking care of business and it seems to be handled
@WolfofArtemis So Adorable
#SexySaturday #Normero is always trying to kill me with the sexy #BatesMotel 
@afooltocry Not my gif, dont remember from wence it came

@TeamBobbyEwing Thank you
@lcfremont thank you I love him
@ChassMM I think we talked about it once but I forgot too until i saw this
@ChassMM right outside and not about that plane on i285 life
@iZombieObsessed Running like Ravi all the way

#iZombieObsessed #iZombie 
@TVObsesssed It's a shame all shows arent on abc, where they renewed everything with more than 11 viewers
@TVObsesssed Sucks. Nothing worse than your show ending without a proper resolution *CoughsWitchesOfEastEndCoughs*
@TVObsesssed Oh no I am so sorry. I bet there's no way they did a proper ending either
#IKnowHowToQuitYou Shows I used to love, but quit after they started testing my last nerves 
@TVObsesssed I have no idea, I jumped off wayyyyyyyyyyy before that mess. It was my first
@dgct2 Oh god that's too cute for words
@TVObsesssed @EW I had no ability to walk away until Heroes, it gave me strength to say "F this I am out"
@TVObsesssed @EW I used to, but now it's just somebody that I used to know
@Patty_1125 @caitlynwinn @Mochiicecreamgi @BatSpeaks @TVObsesssed Total creeper
@Patty_1125 @caitlynwinn @Mochiicecreamgi @BatSpeaks @TVObsesssed Lol looks like the person in the car was creeping
@Thezombiechurch RIP

@EW @TVObsesssed I was loving all those until The Originals then I went nope, not starting that show again
@ChassMM I am rearanging my whole day to miss that, what a horrible thiing
@Horrorgirl1213 Thanks so much
@Currtis25Harr I hope so
@TVObsesssed And the news keeps covering real life events instead of possible spoilers for our shows, like wtf :(
@TVObsesssed Amen to that, like just announce it already, we got enough worries. Surely they are going to pair it with The Omen right??
@MissHorrorNerd And you got to listen to Twisty
Instead of my usual cheap clothes, I purchased high quality expensive pieces that Im now afraid to wear as they seem like family heirlooms
@lcfremont I will go to the crossroads, you ring up Crowley, we will handle this pain
@lcfremont I agree, I don't want to believe! Make a deal with a demon and fix this now.
"Tendered to USPS" aka slow your roll, it's going to be a few weeks. Oh UPS why do you mock me so? You were practically down the street!!!
@lcfremont My heart hurts. I hope they can fix this
@TVObsesssed #BatesMotel having its season finale is too much make it continue please
That sad feeling when you have to go to work &amp; so can't order wine with lunch...

Dom &amp; Letty, because when they said ride or die they meant it #Furious7 #ShipSoHard 
@lightinaugust You almost made me choke on my wine. I cant wait to hear about the brothers maryl and derle...
@lightinaugust I mean, could they even move it out of Atlanta or no???  #ShakesHead
“Cordon”  the dark drama revolves around an epidemic that breaks out in Atlanta. Oh Julie Plec no no and no. No. Not a chance no.
@TVObsesssed amen to that
@lcfremont @ajbowen @birdiebar I love The Signal so much I almost ran off &amp; married segment one
@caitlynwinn It's a total cheat for him to leave her there if true yes
@caitlynwinn But then I am like..why the hell is she there &amp; suddenly we get that warm scene if not to make us care before...
@caitlynwinn and if she burns his daughter alive he gonna have her flayed one way or the other
@caitlynwinn Sansas's kind of does, but who knows?? A lot was ringing true but there are those few WTF bits...
@caitlynwinn It all sounds very possible to me, except the bit with Varys and Littlefinger. I dont get that.
@TVObsesssed If it is not fangirling, I got no time
@GemamauGemma I take it you agree ;)
Random I love Michelle Rodriguez post 
@MFFHorrorCorner thanks a lot
#ThrowbackThursday #FreddieHighmore seemingly rocking Caleb's hair back in the day #BatesMotel

@Jules8777 Yes please be burning someone or something else entirely mkay thanks
@Jules8777 I wish that trailer had cut off, it was too much
@WolfofArtemis It seemed bad and the trailer was worse...but damn it, they can work something out damn it
@BuffyPZW @kimrhodes4real @TheJimMichaels Maybe he is trying to get rid of it??? lol I love this post though
@WolfofArtemis Exactly, clearly there needs to be laws to explain this shit to everyone...
@BuffyPZW @Jules8777 except for hunters, but yes they can make a deal or something...pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@Jules8777 This cant be true, I am rocking denial :(
@WolfofArtemis Exactly! Like she is way too cute to die someone fix it!!!!!
@_dwinchest @feliciaday Someone make a deal with the devil, we got to get her back
@WolfofArtemis Charlie, they killed off Charlie and I can't handle the truth
I am tired of my faves dying on all my shows. Can we break tradition &amp; let them live for awhile please? #Supernatural 
@MunroTurtle No clue. It almost looks like the flash drive but it is late in the day for that
@WolfofArtemis I hope so :(
I am now waiting for @InsideBates to be officially renewed like 
@lesliea10115 @ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @john_hynd @Thezombiechurch Me too I always miss him

@rosemciverfans Done and done
@BatSpeaks Nope I got contacted to have it sent to me, because it seemed like I would like the show but wasnt watching it. Totally random
@BatSpeaks @SHO_Penny I am still so stunned I cant believe it
@moonrisesister When you think exploding heads in movies, Scanners always comes to mind first.
@BatSpeaks Hottest nerds ever, but totlal nerds
@TVObsesssed Lol I guess they knew what they were doing recruiting random folks on twitter to send stuff ;)
@BatSpeaks They are still as cute together as ever
@JoeManganiello @magicmikemovie Take all my money please
#Patriots #NFL …

@TVObsesssed I think I had one of your lucky moments with this....
@VeraFarmiga @TVObsesssed @CriticsChoice We are so proud of you guys

@TVObsesssed I totally did as this took forever, so the Hannibal eye took me slab by surprise
@InsideBates She is always beauitful but somehow even hotter when losing it
@TVObsesssed When I took out the Bates mug, I had Hannibal's eye looking right at me and I had a moment..
@TVObsesssed Did your block get there today? Mine finally decided to show up
@EW @TVObsesssed @InsideBates They are so adorbs
@Patty_1125 @Jules8777 @caitlynwinn glad it isn't anything else because anyone upsetting an 8 month pregnant lady gonna get hit

@iDead_ish After what happened to Witches of East End, I don't think I will ever not worry...

@caitlynwinn Because we all figured it out...although the book &amp; show may be totally different at this point
And to think I thought that #BatesMotel was gonna suck &amp; only turned in for episode 1 out of morbid curiosity &amp; now I am totally obsessed.
@caitlynwinn Everyone says it is obvious now but 3 years ago everyone told me I was a nut for thinking that
@afooltocry Gif from 
I wasn't up for 6 minutes today before I started replaying last night's #Normero scene because OH MY GOD #BatesMotel 
@Thezombiechurch Yep picked their battle all wrong
@Mochiicecreamgi Thanks have a good one
@VeraFarmiga and @CarbonellNestor together is literally the best, and most painful, thing in the whole wide world #BatesMotel #Normero
@annabel_lenore @InsideBates I have always been a shipperholic, but I have never known anything like this before

@WolfofArtemis I look forward to reading your 2 cents on them
@WolfofArtemis I think the Saw movies work best watched together as opposed to spaced out
@rosemciverfans It's lovely
@WolfofArtemis They are better quality than the first, and end up making a bit of sense at the end
@TVObsesssed Why didnt I cut off communication that month they sucked?? Ugh why?
@WolfofArtemis The whole series is overhyped, how did they become a major franchise? The 1st still...lol
@MM_J9 That movie is amazing
@WolfofArtemis The first Saw always makes me laugh

@RiversofGrue @adrowningclown @RainsMinions I love these
"I don't want to be dead anymore Norman." Bradley perhaps telling the WRONG person this in the trailer for next week's #BatesMotel

@Keres81 @TVObsesssed Mads is out of control with the sexy
@TVObsesssed You cant just BOOM make Norman that attractive, you have to warn people, do studies...
@TVObsesssed If I look at that picture of him touching his mouth much longer I may need man crushes part 2...
@TVObsesssed Freddie crashed your list with that photoshoot cause damn

@klarolineepic @SmoakingKC The truth of this almost made me choke to death on a pretzel
When you realize there are no more episodes of #Daredevil to watch 
@lcfremont @HorrorHoneys SRSLY
@lesliea10115 @ItaliaCR_Reedus @Thezombiechurch @Dinelle_Fuller @ryanm10r Which makes it all the more awesome glad the zombies left you solo
“I am the ill intent.” #Goals #Daredevil
@moonrisesister I do, although just thinking about it to this day makes me sad and angry my goodness
@moonrisesister I liked to died when I saw the story on the ID channel. Seeing this may end me but now I feel like I have to
@moonrisesister I am scared now
@lesliea10115 @ItaliaCR_Reedus @Thezombiechurch @Dinelle_Fuller @ryanm10r that picture is awesome

Even looking at caps of #Unfriended is making me laugh... 
@caitlynwinn Then don't watch more Grey's that will really hurt
@lcfremont @HorrorHoneys Great review. I must admit once the game started I lost it and laughed until I cried. Good thing I was alone
@caitlynwinn Bates Bates, get caught up with us
@ayngyl22 real real good mmmmmmm
@ayngyl22 Shhhh I am working on my denail because this diet mr pibb taste goood..
It is perfectly ok to drink a coke this big as long as it is diet right??? 
#Unfriended was a bad movie. However, it had me laughing my ass off for about half of its runtime so it wasn't a complete loss.
@BatSpeaks bless you

@moonrisesister I am somewhat better with pie but was JUST looking to see if you can drink red wine on a juice detox #sinner
@Klarothrone @neontweetsok Stefan &amp; Caroline zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz pass
@TVObsesssed Thanks that was dangerous for a minute #whew
@moonrisesister Exactly save it for the pie binge and the 43th glass of wine
@moonrisesister This might be just what I did, but imagine what it would do to me with my avocado snacks
@etnow @TVObsesssed @CandiceAccola @cwtvd Tries her best to delete this off her TL
@jcsepjj That's unfortunate, and yes would rather watch a blank screen than Mall Cop 2
@jcsepjj @EW At least you get one of them, but it is weird they arent showing it when it is getting great reviews
@EW @jcsepjj I am so excited for this movie
@carrie_helen13 Lol got to relocate there stat!!!!

#ThrowbackThursday Nestor Carbonell in The Dark Knight 
@InsideBates I am almost out of merchandise, I need new stuff to buy!!!!
@TVObsesssed Me too, she is so much more Eric Roberts than Julia Roberts she is great as a villain not so much otherwise
@TVObsesssed But they are all distnctively good for the role of bitchy sorority girl..
@TVObsesssed I was excited for the show, then I saw that and lost it
@TVObsesssed I saw this post while searching for spoilers, should've known it would be you
@Patty_1125 "Will work just for the view..."
@Patty_1125 I love Sia so I am especially punch drunk. How does one get a job to make out with Pedro Pascal all day really tho?
@EWTimStack @TVObsesssed @RobertsEmma So fabulous
@PedroPascal1 being sexy af in Sia's new video, and now a poster for #Hannibal season 3 hits. Today is a really good day.
@Mochiicecreamgi @Jules8777 Chickpeas are delicious and versitile maybe i should try it
@Mochiicecreamgi @Jules8777 nope never, but that's only because I dont like tuna too much
@heidiklum @PedroPascal1 @Sia #FireMeetGasoline 

@SMTVAddict I am so sorry, my heart is with you. I know you were a huge comfort to her

From here on out, when I walk out on someone, I am going to say, "It's just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here." Thanks @RobertDowneyJr
@Operetta_doll @InsideBates The acting on this show really is amazing
@Operetta_doll @InsideBates That was a scene to remember, and Freddie played it so perfectly
@Patty_1125 @caitlynwinn I wont tell Leonardo DiCaprio I promise
@Patty_1125 @caitlynwinn A friend I turned on to it told me just on Sunday, "Thanks for ruinning my life"
@Patty_1125 @caitlynwinn That's me too, I sucketh at names
@caitlynwinn @Patty_1125 It's one of those, "umm...based on a book....umm...just watch it"
@rosemciverfans And she gets so goofy smily when he is around, it warms my heart!!!

@linnieloowho @BonBonfaboo @HorrorHoneys No. No, no, no, no, no. No. Thanks.

@CWiZombie Liv is too adorable for sense
Livwell is so adorable my heart!! #iZombie
I think at this point it is fair to say that Blaine is far too evil to be the Logan of this story #iZombie #VeronicaMars
The best new show on tv is clearly #iZombie it is not even close. I just love this show and the cast so so so much.
Thank goodness that Clive got away from Blaine in time, because I am not tryiing to lose him #iZombie @malcolmjgoodwin
"I did not predict that you would be a fan of the slutty women of middle earth." People always say that to me too #iZombie
"If you're sharing prescription drugs with me I should at least offer you a drink." Shipping LivWell very, very hard #iZombie
@HardHeartdHanna @CWiZombie That made me very happy
@iZombieObsessed @LivDeadGirl I love her so much I don't even know how to deal
Does the cast get along as well in real life as they seem to on the show?? @RahulKohli13  &amp; @malcolmjgoodwin #iZombie
@Mochiicecreamgi Thanks so much
@Chris_Dolfi @imrosemciver I was about to type up the same thing. Blue looks perfect with zombie

@BatSpeaks @InsideBates Twit translates to all corners of the world

@BatSpeaks lol how would you resist???
@BatSpeaks Shouldnt ship but damn it those 2 just wreck my heart
Watching this Normero scene over &amp; over &amp; over  (Bates Motel 3x07) 
I got Liv Moore! Which "iZombie" Character Are You? 
@InsideBates #Normero all the way that is the real stuff
@Figster017 @IamInvizible @ShockingShadow @MzRedRum69 @Cat_ONine @ChrissyOverkill @bloodysweetness I am gonna need a lot
@Jules8777 Me too!!!! Swoon swoon
@BuffyPZW @Jules8777 yep
@BatSpeaks It was a great episode, this season is so on point
@Jules8777 Oh my god, the look he have her during the toast was gosh
@TVObsesssed @Babs_Bunny420 @A_FunkyFreak @RevengeOnDaddy @GodricsDaughter @Patty_1125 Aww you are so sweet
@BatSpeaks Oh god yes!!!! Everything about this show is better each week, even already smoking hot peoples looks
@Jules8777 Happy and smiles and wine...Norma was glowing with pride...oh Norman....
@WolfofArtemis Nice
@TVObsesssed Lol...as long as we arent sneaking in to rub Norma's legs we are ok..i hope
@TVObsesssed :( Why are we trying to get our favorites killed like this?
"I mean can’t a woman get in a freaking mood for one night without the whole world coming to an end?” -Norma Bates #BatesMotel
@TVObsesssed @tvtagBatesMotel Damn show, making us ship when we know no one gets the hell out alive OMG
The Bates family sits down for a nice family dinner, while Norman wonders who to kill next... #BatesMotel 
@Jules8777 The happiest ep ever, and then he goes and does that shite....
@TheKennyJohnson I have been a fan for awhile, but your work on @InsideBates this year has been your best to date.
Shipping is so hard isn't it? RT @tvtagBatesMotel
Now it's just pure torture #Normero #BatesMotel 
@VeraFarmiga  You are so beautiful it is ridiculous
Let us just revel in the hotness of Sheriff Romero ladies &amp; gentlemen #BatesMotel @CarbonellNestor 
"Professor" James leaving after 3 minutes of therapy with Norman Bates like... #BatesMotel 
@InsideBates @TVObsesssed I missed this the first time, and yeah you right
"Don't make me get out the gun and bang your head against the wall and all that shit..." -Sheriff Romero, #BatesMotel
@tvtagBatesMotel @TVObsesssed I don't want to but damn it I am.......
@TVObsesssed oh shite it is lovely
@TVObsesssed almost always I think the first I got was something else
@TVObsesssed the post this is to didn't show <UNAMUSED FACE>
@TVObsesssed @InsideBates You, me and our funkos should be able to handle Norman
@TVObsesssed @InsideBates I am so happy I got a permanent reservation
@Sooriclover I didnt hear nothing...
@Jules8777 Glad you are ok with all the bad weather
@caitlynwinn That would be satisfying to me too, someone who made it all on smarts alone
@caitlynwinn Jon could be a good leader, just not much of a conquerer... Maybe the final shot will be Littlefinger smirking,.... #IWin
@caitlynwinn I was ok with Stannis until he tried to burn that guy to death. I would be ok with no throne #LetItBurn
@TVObsesssed He seems to be suffering from delusions of grandeur...lol be a father figure to Norman see how that works out.... #DeadyMcDead
@Sooriclover Yes that one still hurts and when they say his name I feel stabbed in the heart
@TVObsesssed so he didnt talk about Norman but maybe she wont have to..
@TVObsesssed Yep he is the damn SHRINK with his license on the line, he should handle that shite better. I thought she would blackmail him
@Sooriclover I havent read the books I am afraid of spoiling the show. I love them surprises..well except for when they killed my boo.
@Sooriclover She's my fave too, but last night has me worried she could go mad too. Tyrion is smart as hell, maybe he can help
@Sooriclover Delegate, delegate, delegate Dany... and never alienate your dragons She is my main hope tho...
@TVObsesssed He is a terrible shrink, having sex with a drunk vulnerable patient. He has it coming...
#ManCrushMonday Adam Driver &amp; Nestor Carbonell 
So who is going to win the #GOT? All the current "leaders" have serious flaws &amp; I am not so sure I would follow any of them at this point
@TVObsesssed Yep that picture bodes poorly for his future health...
@TVObsesssed Since the world is clearly ending soon, I hope we at least get to watch Bates Motel first...
@BatSpeaks You cant be mysterious and go, "Oh you I missed you" and hug a girl at the door... lol we need more characters to root for
@Thezombiechurch the last one is hilarious
@InsideBates @TVObsesssed And help will be quickly dispatched...
@WolfofArtemis definitely
Glad to see everyone onboard with #TeamZ!
@CWiZombie 
@TVObsesssed it must be the end of days
@BatSpeaks love him!!!!
@enloversunited @TVObsesssed Sign me up for Imax Alex
@Sooriclover They are all doomed :( I cant imagine who might win the game, no one seems a perfect fit
@WendyJRE @BBohaty Littlefinger probably. Littlefinger knows everything
@BBohaty @WendyJRE If Dany could just learn to delegate, this would work!
Tonight's #GOT has convinced me that there should be more hissing to show disapproval. Definitely.
Daenerys can conquer, but she can't rule. Jon Snow &amp; Tyrion Lannister can lead but not conquer. Can we get a team up and settle this? #GOT
@justajarhead Have a good morning
I love the look of Dorne, but it seems to cryl out for an appearance of Oberyn Martell &amp; he can't be there #Sad #GOT
I want revenge for Oberyn Martell's death too. I am just saying he was way too hot to die #GOT #RememberOberyn 
@Caitlin901 @Sooriclover I too would so choose pacey
I just purchased this awesome @itfollowsfilm movie poster. Can't wait to put it on my wall!! 
@Jules8777 @aubz_dracarys I check every day, "Is it renewed yet?"
I can say enough how much I love @DarrenKavinoky as the host of Deadly Sins on @DiscoveryID
I miss those days when @MACcosmetics was cruelty free &amp; my make up was so much more on point #Sigh
@ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @LoieBertrand @lesliea10115 @citta7 It's beautiful I love it
@suzebee04 @moonrisesister Absolutely, and the score!!! God help me the score. I may sleep with the lights on tonight...just in case...
@moonrisesister @suzebee04 Scariest movie ever, literally makes me sleep with the lights on when I watch it
@BrandonTeague5 Horror fans have to stick together :)
@Thezombiechurch That gave me a good laugh
@LostOnTheFringe You guys are so in your element in these pics
1933-1967 <BIRTHDAY CAKE><GROWING HEART><BIRTHDAY CAKE><GROWING HEART><BIRTHDAY CAKE><GROWING HEART> 
@moonrisesister That damn clown from Poltergeist...
@Jules8777 @aubz_dracarys And it gets better each ep, which is rare
@justajarhead @_LaRoseVie @Paige3846089 @tjawannalewis @allynld1214 @alliegata2615 @MsUnique221 @KelleyBelley08 @ESTWICKwapt Good day all

Random Adam Driver picture just because 
@SuperLaurenLove Hey long time no tweet how are you
@TVObsesssed Not in the least, it's the best season yet and I need at least 20. more eps
@TVObsesssed cant wait for all the blood sweat and tears
@TVObsesssed Norman needs the Harvard level help, not community college. I hope it is him, although I guess everyone is on borrowed time
@TVObsesssed Bad Psychiatrist was my best guess too, big dumb ass probably thought he could come talk to Norman about his feelings...
@lesliea10115 @Dinelle_Fuller @Thezombiechurch @ryanm10r @ItaliaCR_Reedus @timvicious so cute
@caitlynwinn awww that smile
@TVObsesssed Always welcome! Hey was just watching the ad for next weeks Bates, who is Norman going off on at the end you think?

While I was getting a package, Cersei got out, ran down 2 stairs, then looked at me like, "What was I thinking? Come get me please."
@daylilylady134 Crushing Adam Driver is a thing every day

@lcfremont I am geting sick to death of my job, this might be the perfect change!!! I cant wait to plan the spooky Inaugural Parade
@lcfremont Wow this politics stuff is easy wonder why they hold debates and all that...
@askarsismygod That picture should comee with a warning, like be sure you are sitting down first.......
@Thezombiechurch @Dinelle_Fuller @ryanm10r @ItaliaCR_Reedus @lesliea10115 Looking fab, if I do say so myself

@cthulhuobsessed @Currtis25Harr It was even better the second time, I picked up on so much more stuff
So is this my future husband or is J.J. Abrams still keeping Adam Driver locked in his basement? #TheForceAwakens 
@Currtis25Harr I liked it even better the second time, and that's saying something. Kent really killed it
@Currtis25Harr It is so great. They really flip it when you go from thanking god you don't have a brat like that to understanding what is up
@aicforever I loved this movie!!!!
@sldouglas88 :) you are a gentleman and a scholar
@sldouglas88 Happy Birthday!!! Nice of you to share your gift with the rest of us
@sldouglas88 I can't imagine a better holiday gift
@TVObsesssed I hope that is because it is really really really good
@TVObsesssed Can we get a spoiler please?
#ThrowbackThursday Han Solo &amp; Chewy, back in the day #StarWarsCelebration 
@Currtis25Harr @TheBabadook Started that way for me too
I loved #ItFollows. Now if someone could get me her coat &amp; necklace (but not her date) from here that would be great 
@Currtis25Harr @TheBabadook Look forward to your thoughts!
@SandyMelara If he is, he's in costume and we cant tell it is him
@Hellboy919 It's hard it just makes me so happy I want to watch it until Dec
@ActionFigured @BatSpeaks @starwars @LEGO_Group You got mad skills
@Currtis25Harr Losing my shit all over again just looking at this RT my goodness take all my money
@Hellboy919 My whole day is made
@Hellboy919 If there ever was a moment for imax this is it...
@BatSpeaks It will never ever die
@Hellboy919 I am ready to buy my tickets
@Hellboy919 Yep is anything ever going to be better? I dont think so
I kind of feel like just sitting here &amp; retweeting pictures of Han Solo &amp; Chewy all night #TheForceAwakens
If anyone wants to leak definite footage of Adam Driver in #TheForceAwakens that would be great ok thanks.
@mashable @moonrisesister i swear I tear up every time I see that footage of Han and Chewy it's too much
Me seeing Chewbacca &amp; Han Freakin' Solo in the new #TheForceAwakens trailer #StarWarsCelebration 
Oh my god I got tears man - Star Wars: The Force Awakens Official Teaser #2 
@TVObsesssed Norman and the mom inside his head, the only ship that lasts...
@TVObsesssed I should not ship normative for the same reason but alas
I have to step out. Please let the new trailer for #TheForceAwakens be online when I get back please please please #StarWarsCelebration
@RichardDiaz i just hope I make it unitl the movie comes out without dying from excitement
@lcfremont This means a lot coming from a Audrey &amp; Grace fan
I want these on my wall so bad I cant even #StarWarsCelebrationDay #TheForceAwakens 
@lcfremont You know me so well &amp; always link me to perfection
@Currtis25Harr Some people love Hemlock Grove. I am not one of them, thought it was just barely watchable if drunk...
@Currtis25Harr Oh no hope she is feeling better :( Will check in for your review later...

Virtual Reality Bites: 
@moonrisesister @lcfremont True Xfile you are
@pussycat_faster Yep, still looking at that picture...
@Currtis25Harr So did you love the movie?
@Sooriclover I am going to lose my shit over this I know it
@SmoakingKC Awww Friends was so amazing. It always makes me smile in repeats too
@pussycat_faster Gost she's so..gosh

Gina Carano

@InsideBates @TVObsesssed As of last week, I think I ship it...
@lcfremont They are both so lovely, and look like they are thinking of cutting the same bitch...
@gracesegundo Oh wow,  #LivWell is perfect!!! Let me on board the ship please #iZombie 
@BuffyPZW Everyone loves Romero..except those that cross him and get hella shot..
@BatSpeaks Each episode this season has been better than the last, and what a fever pitch my goodness
@BatSpeaks I feel cheated by life now that that never happened
@BatSpeaks best idea ever
@Jules8777 I ship them hard lol, he wouldnt ship him with anyone normal because he is not. Just Norma &amp; her lover gonna end up dead so....
@Jules8777 I love him so much that I probably shouldn't ship Normero just so save his life
@Thezombiechurch nice ride
@TVObsesssed I feel like hyperventilating just thinking about it
@BonBonfaboo @horrosreviews I was too busy going, "damn that drink looks good" to put it together...
@BonBonfaboo @horrosreviews Me too!!! I am pretty sure I started clapping when he zombieness was revewaled.
@TVObsesssed I agree. Like I always loved the show, but this seaosn is just so on point I am running out of good things to say. It's perfect
@SMTVAddict @SleepyHollowFOX Once I heard new showrunner the wait became unbearable...
@horrosreviews @BonBonfaboo #iZombie gets better every week, and it was great episode one..
@TVObsesssed The fact that Highmore played it so low key, like it was the most normal thing in the world, made it so creepy
@rondata You know how us women do... lol
@BatSpeaks Lol for a minute I thought you had a crush on Iggy Pop, which would've also been awesome
@sldouglas88 Yep after her messed up childhood she's the last 1 who needs a mentally ill child, no matter how hard she tries
The love of my life ladies and gentlemen #BatesMotel 
@sldouglas88 I don't think it is her at all, split personalties like that, he's seriously mentally ill from the get go. Feel bad for dylan.
@sldouglas88 I love Vera so much. Norma has so much to deal with, hell I would shoot up my cell phone too
@sldouglas88 you too
Norman Bates is not buying your apology though #BatesMotel 
"I don't think I can keep living my life." Downward spiral Norma Bates is my world. #BatesMotel
You got to love a man who will get up out of his hospital bed to handle his business #BatesMotel #SheriffRomero 
@ryanm10r @TheKennyJohnson They had such a hard time as kids, so I feel so horirble but you can't forgive something like that...ugh
@ryanm10r @TheKennyJohnson breaks my heart in the role, but I think somethings arent forgiveable and I get so confused.....
Is it possible to feel bad for Caleb &amp; think he shouldn't be redeemed no matter how great @TheKennyJohnson is in the role? #BatesMotel
@caitlynwinn Cant wait to watch you fall further and further in lurve
@KP_KaylaMarie @WickedCersei There is no stronger love
@caitlynwinn Ship so hard
@afooltocry Gif from 
Norma &amp; I both be at the bar like... #BatesMotel #SoulMate 

#Variety says #iZOMBIE “a lock for renewal.” Let’s hope they’re right. 
@RobThomas Please be true,please be true
@BatSpeaks Exactly, Major is nice and hot and all that, but not the zombie for Liv....
@_AngelaLansbury @MailOnline true beauty never fades @BatSpeaks
@BatSpeaks Every time they had a convo I was fighting off the urge to squeal, too cute
@TVObsesssed And if you go to their house, they still dont want to hear what you say..
Why is it that expensive shoes fall apart in no time but those half price bargain basement payless shoe store rejects just keep on ticking?
@Sooriclover grrrrrrrrrrrr
@janine6584 @Mariska beautiful
@Currtis25Harr @imrosemciver You have good taste as always
@Currtis25Harr @HorrorHoneys I just watched Babadook last week &amp; boy did I ever love that movie..in the most uncomfortable way

@antisve Thanks, seeing just the end is always so confuzzling
Watching The Flash for 2 minutes before #iZombie comes on always leave me confused, is this a good show or a horrible one?
@Sooriclover I hope so I am so afraid to get my hopes up after Witches of east end
@Patricia__Braun Feeellllsssssssssssssss
@MadsNDads yep
I am sorry to hear about Stephanie March's messy divorce. However, if she is looking for a rebound..call me thanks.

@ryanm10r Hello have a good one
@BatSpeaks Planning on hitting up Daredevil on my off days soon...
@BatSpeaks I cant watch it until the 2nd week of May so it is tempting, but then I would be the fool who gets caught
@BatSpeaks Damn right. Loved the opening and now I am sad I dont have more and kind of want to download the next 3 stat
I like Stannis but after this ep I am not sure he is "the man." Someone else needs to take the throne. Dany I am waiting... #GOT
@BatSpeaks No one on earth. Seeing her come out sneering from the start warmed my heart
@afooltocry Gif from 
When you don't know how much more you can take before you have to cut a bitch #GOT 
@LostOnTheFringe I know, I got all sad just seeing it in the previously on segment...

@DarlinDartxx Cant wait for it to start, seems like the hiatus has been eighty two years
@DarlinDartxx 2 seasons isn't too bad , I started SOA after season 6 now that was work
@DarlinDartxx With the exception of Hemlock Grove, twitter usually leads me to good tv shows
@DarlinDartxx I might have to add it to the To Watch list for sure, that trailer was stunning
@Jules8777 Next time I am out I am giving it a try sounds like it would give you your moneys worth lol
I have never watched Vikings, but the current trailer seems to give me a reason to... 
@Jules8777 Is this a well known drink, cause if so I got to go order me up one stat
@BonBonfaboo Exactly, the not having to buy up to get free shipping alone makes it worth it..the rest is a bonus
@BonBonfaboo Amazon prime is awesome, but this new prime now app is just kicking it to the next level of #TakeMyMoney
@BonBonfaboo I literally cant believe that just happened. I can feel the addiction ready to start.
@CWiZombie @iZombieWriters I want posters of all this great art!!!!!
Kate Beckett's fashion game is so strong on #Castle 
@BatSpeaks Dude I never saw her before but in that one second it was love
@Jules8777 @SouthieJack Sound great
@BatSpeaks I am liking it a lot so far, plus Lucy Lawless in season 2
Amazon prime now really just delivered my order in 1.5 hours. This is going to be dangerous.

@HorrorHoneys @lcfremont One of my favorite b-movies!!! "Is the pizza?"
@BonBonfaboo thanks I love it
@TVObsesssed @ZeldaSmark Oh thank the stars, it was driving me cray
@BonBonfaboo I agree, Morgan is Morgan &amp; doesnt seem to gravitate towards hanging out and being buddy buddy

@Currtis25Harr Exactly! I am not giving up horror for you so clearly this is the end...
@Currtis25Harr I tried but then they started on a tirade against horror &amp; I couldnt take no more...
#IOnceDatedSomeoneWho thought my House on Sorority Row dvd was a porno &amp; got offended. We broke the hell up. 
@SalemWGNA Where @RealLucyLawless goes, I follow.
@InsideBates @TVObsesssed @emptyhearse Well said, well said
@TVObsesssed Same here... exactly
@TVObsesssed They had 1 month I didnt like..followed by Bates &amp; TWD like evil people basiclaly
@TVObsesssed Yep, reorder and then cancel....unless they pull more shennanigans like this..
@TVObsesssed Leave it to me to cancel the Bates Motel month doh
@BatSpeaks Exactly, I was like "What the hell kind of Sophie's choice is this?"
@BatSpeaks I hate having these 2 up against each other :( and the site is a hot mess and cant handle these fandoms...
@carrie_helen13 Bates Motel, making Mondays worth putting up with ...
@BatSpeaks Glitches like anything, and I got to go with my girl....

@ryanm10r Me too, just started the show last night so as to try to get caught up before Lucy Lawless shows up
@BonBonfaboo Just started this because I want to see Lucy Lawless and loving it so far
Watching Salem season 1 like, "No one suspects the hot woman in black sneering at everyone of being the witch?" 
While rocking my new haircut, I have been told twice by gay men that I look like a young Liza Minnelli. I must be looking fierce.

I am pretty sure I am going to have nightmares about the case featured on tonight's #DidHeDoIt @DarrenKavinoky
@belleamie47 Thank you, that's perfect and just what I need. I want to be caught up when Lucy shows up
@Rosaleegarsmith Just in time for GOT to come back..
@carrie_helen13 Absolutely! I saw the trailer a second ago and got all excited over it.
Lucy Lawless is going to be on Salem?? Why didn't anyone tell me?? I will never get caught up in time. 
I will not buy anything from the Orphan Black collection at Hot Topic #Twitch
Happy Birthday @Chris_Meloni. We love you &amp; always miss you on #lawandordersvu 
In honor of the perfect haircut I got today, I pause to reflect on the important haircut role models from my past.. 
@TVObsesssed It's a really good one! They finally got it to you on time too
@lcfremont It was so perfect I was practically dancing when I saw the finished product.
@lcfremont Thanks for the tips. I had a great cut today &amp; I was hoping 25% was enough to let her know I lurve her. Referrals..good tip.
Happy Birthday @PedroPascal1 you sexy scamp you!! 
@TVObsesssed That is depressed
@lcfremont So tell me, what is the right amount to tip an awesome hairdresser????
Because I will never not ship these two #Bensler #lawandordersvu

@Thezombiechurch So many great projects, but Maniac Cop series will always be my fave
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @LoieBertrand @Thezombiechurch @john_hynd Sorry to hear it hope things pick up
@BatSpeaks I love this idea, being slightly different based on the brains you eat. I would probably just eat an annoying arse..
@BatSpeaks I think I would've kept this brain, being a sociopath could come in handy
@BatSpeaks Yep, truly a strong person, so I am a zombie, time to buck up and keep it moving...
@BlaireLovesTV @KyleLovesTV Me too, I was crushed when they said it wasnt :(
@BlaireLovesTV @KyleLovesTV Because it is April Fool's day you want to think it is a joke somehow...
@BatSpeaks It is so good it makes me feel super charged or something

RIP Robert Z'Dar. I enjoyed so many of his movies, but Maniac Cop is one of my very favorites. 
@BonBonfaboo Until a formal announcement, I always assume any and all talks of anything I love are internet rumors..happy to be wrong :)
@BonBonfaboo She is one of my very favorites too, I never dreamed we would get more. It's an all around great day now.
@BonBonfaboo same
@Willnflorida Great taste, it won me over so fast.

Another great episode of #iZombie tonight. I love the show &amp; the cast more each week. 
@youaredoomed80 thanks I love the art

@RavenKnighte Thanks for the good review ;)
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @Thezombiechurch @ryanm10r @timvicious me too it is going to be intense
@Dinelle_Fuller @Thezombiechurch @ryanm10r @ItaliaCR_Reedus @timvicious His "not yet" of last week seems more insidious lol
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @Thezombiechurch @Dinelle_Fuller @ryanm10r @timvicious @WalkingDead_AMC Best non Daryl or Carol moment ever
@TVObsesssed Nothing ever works in the bldg, got to go up and down floors to find a working or clean toilet half the time

@carrie_helen13 Great post, folks think it has to be one or the other but it can be both
@Jules8777 He has to be an angel. There is no other way to splain it
#FlipOffFriday Simon Pegg gets the honors 
@KirstenMoodie7 @CWiZombie That would certainly get people signing up for #TeamZ
When someone gets you mad &amp; you lose control of your inner zombie #iZombie 
@MissBellaBlitz @lcfremont @HorrorHoneys Great review, especially since I was thinking this was the maudlin A&amp;E tv show...

@GoT_Cast Christ she is beautiful
@Mochiicecreamgi Nice to see him in something new &amp; looks like the reviews are good
@Mochiicecreamgi Nope but I just watched it. could be interesitng
@Mochiicecreamgi I have a few that are close but nothing quite that satisfying
@Mochiicecreamgi I got to sit in the back left corner or things just seem all worng
@Mochiicecreamgi @Clorox Back in the day I used the hell out of it, the scent is so good for non asthmatics
@Mochiicecreamgi Nothing worse than going to the movies to find someone is in your "spot"
@Jules8777 Awww all anyone has to do is give it a chance &amp; they are hooked. I hope #izombie keeps doing well I need more
@Jules8777 Isn't it great?? I am soo excited to see what they do next.
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @LeahSully @LoieBertrand @citta7 @lesliea10115 they better not hurt him
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @LoieBertrand @Thezombiechurch @john_hynd @Dinelle_Fuller @timvicious that picture isnt promising
I wish I could ever once be as excited by anything as my cat is by me doing the least little bit of cleaning #Pounce
@Patty_1125 @RamboDonkeyKong I was watching SOA season 6 last night &amp; they just hinted at Opie's fate and I got all sob sob sob
@Patty_1125 @RamboDonkeyKong He is so creepy in that picture I can only imagine what he is gonna get up to
I wish @Clorox didn't test on animals. I really miss the smell of Pine Sol.
@carrie_helen13 Always makes me feel shabby, feel like it gets in on her closing arguments
Casey Novak lost this case, but hair game still so strong #lawandordersvu 
@lcfremont I got the aps, I am always at the store, trying to scan something just to be sure...
@ryanm10r @ItaliaCR_Reedus @Dinelle_Fuller @LeahSully @LoieBertrand @citta7 @lesliea10115 Gosh
@BatSpeaks @twitter I keep missing important fandom discussions, world peace is at stake!!!!
If @twitter could send me my notifcations, that would be great thanks. 
@lcfremont They are so so hard to avoid but I try really hard because forget @LOrealUSA if they test on animals
@lcfremont @BonBonfaboo @pussycat_faster @HorrorHoneys @moonrisesister @ShawnFreeman27 @bmppink You will be when they curse your ass ;)

@TVObsesssed Why dont i get this lucky tho
@CWiZombie @iZombieWriters I love this comic art so much
@JPLabGuru I don't think they ever said, but I am usually under the blanket scared to death...
@JPLabGuru My whole life after this ep, I cant handle someone calling me a girly girl
@JPLabGuru I could never look at that actor the same way again...
@carrie_helen13 @tacobell It made me lose my appetite,
@carrie_helen13 @tacobell Literally laughing outloud tho and I am not sure why
@carrie_helen13 I always always miss this show
#ThrowbackThursday #TheXFiles Irresistible, the scariest episode of TV ever produced. 
#ThrowbackThursday Xena &amp; Gabrielle, #XenaWarriorPrincess #IShipIt 
@TVObsesssed Take a day off to get a break, the asshats come to you
@BatSpeaks @imrosemciver The 2nd ep was even better than the first, this series makes me so happy

Cool story from @dansolomon about Old Man Thomas 
@Mochiicecreamgi It better be I want the biggest best screen possible
@Mochiicecreamgi No question
@Mochiicecreamgi I dont think he is, think that was a rumor :(
@Mochiicecreamgi Yes just made the already super exciting news all the better
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @LoieBertrand @Thezombiechurch @john_hynd If I had to pick 2, it would be Daryl and Carol #gulp
@Mochiicecreamgi Me too, cant wait for Star Wars
@Mochiicecreamgi I saw this on my TL &amp; immediately wanted to favorite and RT it, losing all track that it was my post because #love
@Mochiicecreamgi It was short lived &amp; cheesy and horrible, but I loved it lol
@Mochiicecreamgi Nope the short lived tv show
@BonBonfaboo Thanks and that is the truth!!!!
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @LoieBertrand @Thezombiechurch @john_hynd Me too, I am gonna be in a panic
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Dinelle_Fuller @LoieBertrand @Thezombiechurch @john_hynd My babies better be ok
@BonBonfaboo It's all so much fun, but the writing..just takes it to another level
#WomanCrushWednesday @VeraFarmiga owns my heart 
@TVObsesssed sometimes you got to take a day off, before you end up flipping a console and slapping someone
@moonrisesister @lcfremont I could buy crazy rick if it wasnt so much over Jessie. That story makes me miserable ugh zzzzzzzzz
@Sooriclover It really revealed itself to be an even deeper, better show than I though. Plus, Blaine lol. I like how she didnt fall for it..
@Sooriclover Me too, loved it more than the first and that is saying something. Blaine was great, and loving how she is different weekly
So far today I have made coffee &amp; rewatched episode 1.2 of #iZombie.  I love it when I am so super productive! 
@moonrisesister Folks fall for everything. I am glad that you didt tho
@Isalleen Great use of Rumpel
@emilyzombie13 @imrosemciver She really is
@RebelRed1013 It is amazing
#iZombie 
I have gone super hard down the #iZombie rabbit hole &amp; there is a shortage of merchadise to buy &amp; it is upsetting #TakeMyMoney
@iZombieNation It was great, and opened up so many doors for future eps.
I am excited to see how Liv is going to be different every week, depending on her choice of brains. So many possibilities #iZombie
@Mister_Bones I totally missed him entirely, like the hell??? I think I am going for Madman next
@Patty_1125 He is so pretty
@Mister_Bones Just now checking out his stuff &amp; love the use of color
#IZombie is such a good show!! The second episode was even better than the pilot. I can't wait for more @CWiZombie
@Mister_Bones The art is so great, I wish there were more posters out there I would have them all over
@Mister_Bones Loving this ep so much. Plus, loving the comics
@malcolmjgoodwin I love this show &amp; you are perfect on it
@RahulKohli13 If that doesnt put sales through the roof I dont know what will... ;)
Must not ship... Must not ship... #twitch #Izombie
@ElvenTempest @CWiZombie Never ever goes away
@RahulKohli13 Are you going to get any sexiness on #Izombie  or are you sticking with vibrant abstract nudes?
@thisisfay It's beautiful
Last week, I did not get that Liv would be different every week. The show &amp; @imrosemciver are better than I thought #Izombie
Blaine &amp; Liv talking that zombie life is kind of adorable #iZombie
@ludivineboots Me too it's so good
@imrosemciver #iZOMBIE 
#izombie is only on week 2 &amp; I am already so happy to see @imrosemciver @RahulKohli13 @malcolmjgoodwin &amp; the rest of the cast again #love
"Who doesn't love a vibrant abstract nude?" #Izombie already making me smile with its great writing
@ItaliaCR_Reedus @ryanm10r @Thezombiechurch @LoieBertrand @Dinelle_Fuller @john_hynd awww those guys
@PaytenAutumn Me too!!! I want a 70s vampire looking bordello house
@Thezombiechurch Have a godo trip
@caitlynwinn @Patty_1125 @BatSpeaks @Mochiicecreamgi @ashleynh04 @coats1234 Adorable!! Watch your back tho
@TVObsesssed @InsideBates finally giving us a reason to look forward to Monday
@TVObsesssed I watched it early this morning and was doing much the same. I swear he was Perkins in some scenes
@TVObsesssed Literal and metaphorical homicide
@BonBonfaboo @The_ZombieQueen @horrosreviews @lcfremont @Kittyk_77 @moonrisesister @RushFan100 I love it!!!!
@ferrarigrunn @InsideBates If they add pjs to the line I would be all about them
Nothing bad could come from putting on your #BatesMotel robe &amp; going to take a shower right? @InsideBates 
@HorrorHoneys @moonrisesister It's horrible, so many classics &amp; not so classics I love so
@BatSpeaks We have our hashtag ready, best watch yourself peeps
@BatSpeaks You know it. He better just stay away from Romero's lady love
@BatSpeaks I am not the good with the tumblr, glad to have you to back me up
@BatSpeaks So many great Norma moments last night, the morgue, the evil eye to the psych teacher when she was leaving, the crying at the end
@BatSpeaks I love you!!! Lol I was at tumblr not finding it. That is the greatest thing.
@BatSpeaks I am flattered ;) She's my life hero. I still need a gif or her kicking down the bathroom door last night
@BatSpeaks I will be knocking bitches out of my way to get a seat to that, so excited for a million reasons, one being Adam of course
@moonrisesister @HorrorHoneys Evil Dead 1&amp;2, Candyman, Fright Night, Spider Baby &amp; Night of the Comet today. Answers could change tomorrow..
@BatSpeaks Can't wait to see him in Star Wars, love when new crushes take off
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Where? What did I miss? Can we cut up Pete and Jessie instead thanks
'Girls' EP Jenni Konner talks the season finale &amp; snow 
@BatSpeaks @lenadunham @girlsHBO It's a great show. Sometimes frustrating but it always pays off. Plus, Adam Driver
Thanks to @lenadunham &amp; the case of @girlsHBO for the best season yet of Girls. Every last episode was just so perfect.
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Share ladies, share...
@BatSpeaks I still cant believe this is happening
@OceanTess @dmathches Absolutely smouldering, great taste
@WolfofArtemis There needs to be a whole line of bandais that work in those tricky places
@WolfofArtemis I hate that, esp when folks are like "get a bandaid" like they dont understand
@Variety @moonrisesister I just woke up and, while reading this, I had to make sure I wasn't dreaming
@Mochiicecreamgi @ashleynh04 @Patty_1125 @PoppyBaker7 @BatSpeaks @caitlynwinn @laralee1199 @coats1234 @hesgorge Oh Channing...
@lcfremont @dmathches The piocture on the right, quite possibly may be the death of me
@Figster017 Lol, always just likethis with crazy, the 2 of us
@Figster017 I am ok, we have missed all the snow so that's great. Sorry to those who had to put up with it
@Figster017 That would really make life a lot easier
@Figster017 Way too long but always enjoy that morning coffee
@justajarhead Have a good one yourself
Freddie Highmore @VeraFarmiga @CarbonellNestor @maxthieriot @TheKennyJohnson &amp; everyone else on #BatesMotel are all so perfect together.
I thought it would be nice for us to meet.
-Why would that be nice?

Same Romero, same. #BatesMotel
"When she said she was working at a party, I didn't think she was a magician." Norman's got jokes #BatesMotel
Same, about 20-30 times a day #BatesMotel 
@Figster017 yes please
@RahulKohli13 More of the mythology &amp; the characters. Love you guys so much already
@BatSpeaks @InsideBates @BuffyPZW At least we wont have to worry about spoling each other
@BuffyPZW @InsideBates Oh no :( The wait is horrible, esp when the first 2 eps were so amazing...
Leaving for work, where I will be counting down the minutes unitl I can get home &amp; watch @InsideBates
Apparently @QuestionAnders agrees that I shouldn't follow him. I am laughing my ass off right now. 
Following @QuestionAnders has me thinking that I really shouldn't have followed him
<ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT><ELEPHANT>
Klaus And Caroline Forever 
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Lol to yell I would have to care more, they need to revamp everyone but carol at this point
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Redeemed??? For what? He didnt try to kill a man in his own house while coveting his wife
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Now you have gone too far.... but who would've guessed Daryl would play better with others than anyone else...
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed I feel bad for the folks in Alexandria for bringing in such a nut
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed And if the whole thing is focusing on this Jessie Pete shit god help me
@dime85sg I definitely dont.
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Yep and frankly Shane was better at the crazy so this is the inferior reboot
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Truth. The focus on this Jessie Pete nonsense just has me itching to change the channel wtf Rick
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Thank god, hope they dont take a road trip to a boring as fuck town
@Patty_1125 @TVObsesssed Just awful. I dont think these folks would be wrong to kick Rick out, I would've done it myself or shot him
