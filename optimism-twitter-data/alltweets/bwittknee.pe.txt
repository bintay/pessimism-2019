@Kirsten_Falck But I was dying when she told her to climb in the oven. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Kirsten_Falck But I feel like there will be a weird twist because there always is in his movies. Like she has a severe case of dementia<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Kirsten_Falck I think it's about how you look at it. If it's seen as a possession movie then yeah it looks bad. Lol
@Kirsten_Falck I actually think it will be good! At least I hope so! Any movie by M. Night Shyamalan is really good to me. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
My fav part of Mean Girls is when Cady saves Jingle Bell Rock. Totally something I'd do tbh
I plan on finishing Breaking Bad within the next 24 hours. Bet on it.
I'm about to obliterate this B Dubs in 5 hot seconds.

I bought a new backpack today in hopes of making summer classes a little more bearable. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> Not working
Social media shouldn't be my outlet when I'm upset or angry. Twitter shouldn't be the first place I go to when I'm worked up.
I know I'm just as guilty as the next person when it comes to saying/tweeting stuff on the spot, but I am over it. I'm almost 20 years old.
@uhhakunamatata Exactly. If it doesn't affect you or anyone else in any way then why does it matter?
I GET SO WORKED UP AT STUPIDITY. IT IS SO EASY TO BE ACCEPTING. IT REALLY IS.
You have a huge platform in which you could spread love and awareness and you decided to choose hate. Way to be backwards. @WendyWilliams
One big interview to finally get people to chill with the gossiping and accusations? Yes, what a fame whore. Screw you, @WendyWilliams.
Paparazzi dogged on him for a long ass time and he kept everything hush hush. How is he a fame whore? Because he had one interview?
I would have done the same damn thing if I were him. Before he became the subject of every magazine, how often did he speak out before?
Did @WendyWilliams really call Bruce Jenner a "fame whore" for deciding to have an interview with Diane Sawyer about being transgender?

Happy Birthday! @maaddiissoonn_1 <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

Thanks for being the most open-minded person I know. I could only hope to be as badass as you at 94. Happy Birthday!

I got a call back from B Dubs in NC. Do you guys understand how many chicken wings I will consume if I work there? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> This is bad. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Either way, I am so happy for Bruce! I don't care what your views are. Everyone deserves happiness and comfortability and he is getting his!
Tear celebrities down while they're low and give them kudos when they're doing great. Twisted as shit.
The sad part is every tabloid and newspaper will flip their views now that Bruce Jenner has finally built up the courage to tell everyone.
Yes! It makes perfect sense to scrutinize B. Jenner while he is fighting his own battles and is trying his hardest to tell the world.
I hate the media. It sickens me.

7) That's it and Maggie and I are badasses the end
6) I've obviously acclimated to the Indy lifestyle considering I just screamed at an angry ghetto man to go fuck himself.
5) You can't offer to give away tickets like you're Oprah Winfrey???????????
4) Do NOT scream at me when there are -2 teeth in your mouth. I honestly think he lost one as he was yelling at me.
3) Learn how to communicate properly AKA don't be a dumb ass and scream at the wrong car.
2) If traffic disobeys then don't throw a fit and swing your stop sign around like you're advertising for Little Caesars. Honestly confusing
1) Learn how to direct traffic.
So, friends, I have some very important points to make today.
I honestly don't know if I was the Exorcist of Emily Rose at this point. All I know is I snapped and told him to go fuck himself. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
He was like a yippy ass dog all up in my George Foreman. I'm pretty sure my pupils dilated and my heart beat slowed down like a superhuman.
He starts screaming, "YOU WANT A TICKET?! YOU'LL GET A TICKET! WANNA TICKET?! YOU CAN GET A TICKET! GET A TICKET!" Maggie is slowly dying.
The light turns green and we go to pull forward and this son of a bitch has the nerve to walk forward and up to our car and keep at it.
He wasn't even listening and just kept screaming so I decided to turn my head forward and call him a dumb ass. Case closed, right? Wrong.
Maggie is about to sit there in the seat and start crying and I turn into Satan himself and yell, "IT WAS THE CAR IN FRONT OF US!"
He lit a fire within me. I got 3 hot hours of sleep last night and just left an exam. You do NOT yell at me.
He yelled, "LEARN HOW TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN! LEARN HOW TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN! LEARN HOW TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN!"
So we drive down the road past his lovely coworker. As we are sitting and waiting for the light to turn green, the man starts yelling at us.
The man is frazzled and we are confused on whether to go or not because he's facing a different direction. We stop anyway out of respect.
The chubby man holding the sign gets frustrated and picks up his walkie talkie and sends a message to his coworker down the road.
Here I am, leaving class with my good pal, Maggie. A man is directing traffic with a stop sign. The car in front of us disregards the sign.
Anyone wanna hear my story of the day? I'm going to share anyway. <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Wow I'm tired lol

@bwittknee And cheesecake is so damn good so it must be a flaw in my character
I honestly think I've asked 12 people to go to The Cheesecake Factory and I still have nobody to go with. So

I was sitting at a stoplight with my windows down and no music playing. All I heard was the wind blowing through the grass and palm trees.
@bwittknee *small town down south*
It's ideal for me to have a family in a small town so we can focus on the important parts of life rather than materialistic stuff.
I love being in this little town filled with trailers and fields of palm trees rather than vacation hotspots in Florida. It's so peaceful. <RELIEVED FACE>
Am I Tumblr enough for you yet? Will you accept me now? Is this in vogue? 
Guys, Florida really does bring out the best in her. Not only did she let me touch her...SHE LET ME HOLD HER HAND!

It's obligatory to listen to Palm Trees while I'm cruising through 80 degree weather in Florida with my windows down.

Don't judge a person because that person chose a different route for his/her life. We're all successful in our own ways. It's magnificent.

Separate my side
Me when I hit Florida 
I have one class separating me from Florida. One. Class.
I was dead asleep and butt naked to find Abigail and Maggigail outside of my window this morning whispering sweet nothings. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Brittney Barrett, lover of everything pasta 

Sometimes I'm having a rough day and I just have to channel my inner Ross Phillips. He's my motivation to keep going. 
Treat me like an option and I'm gone.
I heard Nickleback, Iggy, Soulja Boy, and Pitbull are touring this summer. Hmu if you wanna go halfsies on tix packages!!!!! Straight fire
@kaleighalexandr OH THANK YOU BLESS YOUR BEAUTIFUL HEART<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
When incoming freshmen ask me how life changes once you get into college 
I'm in dire need of Subway right now. Someone please hit up Joe McIntosh because I have a feeling he'd drive from ISU to open for me.
"Brittney, you are the best performer that's ever lived. Teach me your ways. I'll do anything. I'll eat dog turds." 
@_GirlWhoLived AKA pack your bags and head out the door if you're team Android because you don't stand a chance with them green bubbles. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
A little cheesy, but I love my mom to death. I don't love her for buying me these; I love her for understanding me. 
It said that life has had me down a lot recently, but I'm out of this world and to never stop shooting for the stars.
I found a box sitting on my dresser with a note this morning!
I put a pair of earrings on a wish list a month ago because they're expensive and I'm a broke college student. A girl can admire from afar.
So idk if you guys knew but I'm obsessed with everything pertaining to the sun/moon/stars.
@Joe_Garv <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

I'm not one to play games on my phone but I'd twerk too hard for a Nintendogs or Tamagotchi app. I'm not gonna lie.
Ok @jwoolums20 is honestly making me anxious as he cracks down on his list he follows. So many rules and regulations...nervous
I am seriously crying because I can't get my cat to take her antibiotics and I'm scared she's going to die like if she dies I'm dead <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

All he could do was flip me off and brake check me. You, dick head, are a skid mark on the underpants of society.
Saw some guy slap a woman in their car and I basically body slammed my horn. Then I called the police and gave the license plate number. <FISTED HAND SIGN><DANCER>
@heytheredimiya That's so me. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

@bwittknee Actually it's this who am I kidding 
I'm glad @DustingGray 
@lexx_prebb NC
@KeatonLeveridge Ok now ur just getting cocky. Chill Keyt
Keaton's story literally just made me laugh so hard that I puked a little in my mouth and choked on it 
Plot twist: It's literally my grandma and I act like I have no clue who she is. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> jk
I giggle every time I go to show choir competitions because grandmas always hug me and tell me they miss me performing but idk who they are.
Hey Aunt B, where's the Old Spice? 
@_LucyintheSkyyy @Tina_Saini @ashley_smith17 @jennadenlinger 
Not to mention she made a book of selfies for him for his birthday...

...and made a new one for his wedding gift
How self-centered can one person be? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Kim K makes me sick. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> She had a dinner party before her wedding and had everyone at the table tell her how much Kanye obsesses over her.
They shaved my kitten's belly to spay her and I can't help but rub it like she's Buddha. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Nothing is worse than feeling like you don't have anybody in an exact moment.
Aunt BB gets this little stinker overnight. He will be sick of baby kisses and fat roll pinches by the morning. <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è 
Normally I would kill someone that wakes me up early but I miss my best friend so I guess I can bend the rules.
