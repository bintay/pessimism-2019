Not only are many Singaporeans bad drivers, they are also bad pedestrians. If you want to jaywalk, don't do it when a car is 50m away?!
@crazyarnie There is a shop which sells the exact same thing as Black Ball at only $2.50. Called Beanstalk.
@crazyarnie Yeah, seriously.
Hate has never changed anyone for the better. Only hurt people will hurt people. When you throw stones, you only want revenge, not change.
Wish media would stop talking about Amos Yee and people just stop directing hate to him, or making him out to be hopeless.
Damn smart marketing move and yes, I would relish watching the video in the day due to time difference :)
Always look forward to and enjoy @ElvinNg80's speech haha
@LividEye After tt, I started observing female friends and it really is quite true. When you physically give way, you also verbally give way
@LividEye I once read abt a social expt where girls tend to give way while guys don't do as much. Add to tt, many girls give way &amp; apologise
@LividEye Yeah I think it's how local females have been socialised to behave (betw. females generally non-confrontational, mutual apology)
@songboh Same. Zalora too.
RIP Mr Samat :'( You will be in the loving memory of all Crescent alumni.
Morning train read today: Foucault reader. Shall be prepared to enter office with great mental exhaustion haha.
@LividEye Women in sg like to say sorry even when other ppl bump into them. I dunno why.
@chezevo Haha yeah she mentions you (and other digress peeps) occasionally! Will let her know :)
@crazyarnie Haha cuz lately it's mostly stuff like work angst so I tweet on my personal twitter. Too dangerous to be made public :X
Apparently bae is also a Danish word for poop.
Only for Android: WhatsApp lets users disable annoying 'blue ticks' in latest update Tech2 Mobile 
I thing I will just steer clear of shipping and postage now, if I can help it.
I've had 2 int'l shipping this year and both screwed up. The prev was eBay but I wasn't expecting this, having bought direct from @amazon.
.@amazon delivered my @BYUVocalPoint Spectrum album...with a nice long crack on the CD case. Dismayed.
Might start on the Discworld series but good gracious, there are so many of them.
The Percy Jackson franchise was the only book series I followed after Harry Potter, which makes me a little sad that it has ended too.
I feel slow reading The Blood of Olympus after 1 month of its release. Everyone I know who reads the series finished within the first week!
An addtion to WhatsApp (Android): Unread messages widget. To give ppl the backdoor to reading msgs without incurring the blue ticks, maybe.
@VocalPointFans Thanks and I did! But I'm sure we all agree that 15 secs just ain't enough for @BYUVocalPoint's awesomeness ;)
Sometimes it seems to me that the wanderlust some people claim they have is subconscious escapism from their busy lives.
Being an int'l fan of @BYUVocalPoint is tough. No videos of their concerts on YouTube yet to enjoy vicariously :(
In other exciting news, I'll be watching Neymar and Kaka (&amp; the Brazilian national football team) play live in SG!!! :D Against JPN
We have 4 months. Hopefully I can squeeze out time amidst work exhaustion to learn simple coding to carry it out!
Planning bf's valentine's/bday project with programmer friend! Cuz we are gonna use arduino and raspberry pi! ;D
I've never let my looks affect the way I saw myself. But when I start wanting to change how I look, it will change what I feel makes me, me.
It pretty much boils down to how I see myself and how others see me.
What makes me, me?
Next time I wanna go to these countries again for a more in-depth travel. And also East Europe! But I most certainly am in love w Croatia.
But Central Europe is such a gem! I wanna explore it more properly again! Czech, Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia have all been amazing.
Finally back after 3 weeks of travelling! Bali chill vacation and then traipsed around Central Europe. But home is still best :)
@crazyarnie @LividEye so sorry juz saw this! I'm currently saving up for grad trip so can't do buffet. But pls go ahead! :)
@hahazZ YES!! Deprive so many fans of watching the concert! :(
@why_vo I wear the hush puppies kind which actually look pretty stylish but the sole is like sport shoes! Highly recommend!
@why_vo I already do haha :P
Want to buy Taylor Swift Red Tour tix but the black market is insane. So many who bought just to profit what the heck &gt;:(
Should have thought of this earlier and asked for testimonial before even applying for jobs. Too blur about job search.
So...job interview tmr but I don't have formal wear and testimonial. Going to buy clothes now but testimonial too last min alr...
International giveaway for The Fault in Our Stars by John Green! :) 
Why can't they all just be best friends? Their friendship is beautiful without all that romance.
Nice one JKR lol. Well I've never really thought Ron/Hermione was compatible but I never thought of Harry/Hermione in that way too.
There's a fan subtitling group called 你是疯儿我是傻 HAHAHA what a pun #huanzhugege #你是风儿我是沙
@LividEye some international students welcome thing
Really doubt that the movie will franchise will be able to do justice to the emotional depth of the series.
There've been many great books tt made me think, few stirred emotions but almost none tt stimulated me mentally &amp; emotionally till Allegiant
The series shouldn't just be seen as Young Adult it just because its main characters are young. It was mature and deep from the 2nd book.
Finally finished Allegiant and I have so much I want to say about the ending but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.
@chezevo haha you've got a lucky little sister then :)
At the start of the year where I turn 23, it is super shiok to hear strangers say I look 18. Wahaha :P
@play_nate Why '91? I'm born in '91 and can't do that either
"The eye cannot take unless at the same time it gives." Simmel (1921), on the mutual glance being the most basic human interaction.
It is not the value of a gift but the love and thought of the giver that brings joy to the recipient &lt;3
@esti_d I was embarking on a quest to somewhere when I got woken up by phone vibration from messages :/ I still woke up happy though haha!
@crazyarnie Do you read the series too? I just finished House of Hades haha
This morning started awesome cuz I dreamt that I was made Praetor of the Roman legion. &amp; the whole day has been great since. Blessed Xmas!
Here's to re-reading the whole Heroes of Olympus series without screwing my eyesight over! Whee~
House of Hades was much more exciting than Mark of Athena. It's remarkable how Rick Riordan pieces together so many myths to form one epic.
But I haven't spent much time in a home setting just lazing so it's really nice to do so :)
Other than spending time with your favourite people of course. And exercising. Or eating really yummy food. All not mutually exclusive haha.
Reading a book (Heroes of Olympus: House of Hades) uninterrupted for hours, on my bed. The best kind of day in a holiday.
My academic competence didn't deserve them but I did try my best, so thank God for Your grace and profs for seeing effort as well.
The profs were really kind. Perhaps cuz it's honours yr? I know some of those mods should've gotten B or B- but got B+ instead.
@esti_d Haha thanks for the courage boost. I did go see my results after cuz I realised I have worried half my day away w/o even seeing them
Still don't dare to see my results haha
@LividEye Totally...
@LividEye @crazyarnie nope windows. What issue?
@LividEye I was okay until they started putting ads in the middle of vids sometime ago, so I turned to Adblock @crazyarnie
@crazyarnie you can get adblock extension if you use chrome @LividEye
@hellofrmSG maybe because it sounds the closest to a Mandarin word.
5 hours of sleep... that familiar discomfort in my body that I experience so often during term time &gt;.&lt; I don't want hols to end yet ~
@sakkksak Hahaha he said that cuz he was suggesting I give chocs as Christmas presents to my teenage boy cousins
@chezevo I think the problem is I only ever see them play with phones and computer and not these blocks anymore. New age kids...
@chezevo ohh hmm that sounds legit too!
Bf says "boys all love chocs". Can someone confirm that hahaha
@esti_d Clothes sound like a good idea since I don't think I can afford the kind of games they play lol
@chezevo Secondary school. I've got a rather tight budget which makes it difficult. Help~
Someone tell me what to buy as Christmas present for teenage boys!! Headache :/
MDA should just call themselves MCA. C for Censorship.
Got my hands on a secondhand 3DS XL. Pokemon Y, here I come~
Highlight of this Christmas has gotta be all these reindeer cars - cars with antlers and red noses attached to them ^^
At Tim Ho Wan now and although the shop is just an unassuming little shop without glam food presentation, the dim sum got me swooning.
Some cha can teng (HK cafe) food! 
Maybe because it's my nth time here, I don't feel like taking much pictures, just enjoy haha
Weather here in hk is damn awesome...but that's cuz of global warming. Aunt says it used to be way colder in the past :/
@LividEye Haha but HK in winter is just colder but no snow or anything!! Yup gonna eat shop and go see nature! Whee~ will tweet pics! :)
@LividEye Yep flying to HK tmr morning! Desperately need to run away from SG after such a tough period haha!
@LividEye Thank you! :) Haha got screwed over by the paper but I'll take it as motivation to work harder next sem :)
I just wanna maintain above 3.5 and grad with honours so I don't waste one year of sch fees but why does it feel like such a difficult task
@LividEye Yeah except that my seniors told me that some profs don't hesitate to give Ds and Fs in honours mods :S
An unpleasant realisation that each bad grade has an even greater influence on my CAP now that every mod is 5mc. Faints.
@LividEye Thanks for your consolation John :) yeah just gotta go and hope my prof will be kind enough not to fail me.
I think I feel even more unprepared than yesterday...which is sad because I did study for it but just too early. Can't rmb anything :'(
Woke up this morn crying cuz I dreamt that my beloved died. Every day tt your loved ones are still around is 1 more day to love and be loved
I like school. I love learning. I don't mind assignments although they are stressful too. But exams? Hell no.
Gotta remind myself that in future when I work, I must not romanticise exams in my nostalgia and think it'll be nice to mug for exams again.
@crazyarnie I think surveillance came out last year when I took it... I seem to rmb writing abt it. But of course it may still come out agn.
@crazyarnie Did you read Foucault?
@esti_d It does, and though my body is resisting, still gotta mug :( Thanks! :)
@frezb Haha you must have a good study envt at home then! My surroundings at home distracts me (read: bed) :P
@frezb thanks nx! :) Yep...it's sad since it is otherwise a great place to mug.
If only we had a culture of wearing mask when sick, at least in the lib during exam time! Then there won't be people passing their flu ard.
I know it was the library because my nose is sensitive when I'm around ill people. I started sneezing non-stop after being there for an hr.
Next time I will just stay at home or study at open air place. Been sick for days after sitting at the library for a few hours last week.
@LividEye well-said!
Mémoire ouvrière (working-class memories); lieux de mémoire (sites of memory). The kinds of memory that Singapore doesn't have or is losing.
@play_nate @LividEye yep drink herbal tea or if you have phlegm, luohanguo drink. And get some meds from uhc! Yours sound quite bad alr.
Yep, pompous words are usually French, pun intended. [pompeux]
Clean water to bathe in, just a few steps away from a comfortable and warm bed in which I can enjoy stormy weather without fear. Am blessed.
@crazyarnie @strawcow Cuz if you love someone, you have to commit to action. Loving only in your heart does nothing to maintain the r/s...
@kangsheng would be quite a twist if they decide not to break up after the kiss haha
Not learning piano earlier in primary or secondary sch, even though I had the interest and parents were willing. #biggestregret
@kangsheng No, but murder isn't gendered nor against a certain grp here. Rape is always said in the context of 'a woman deserved it'.
@kangsheng Words "rape the girlfriend" being taught to thousands of young males as a form of 'male bonding' (in the words of my male friend)
@kangsheng Guess I didn't specify the context but was responding to the ban of rape lyrics in the army song Purple Light.
The fact that people can say others are being sensitive over 'just song lyrics' that destroys a woman shows something wrong w society.
If it's ok to sing abt raping a woman just cause she ditched you, is it ok to start singing about killing our parents when they scold us?
@LividEye Thank you for organizing and great to know all of you ^^ @astyrred @crazyarnie @keeweeeee @play_nate @septembreneuf @why_vo
It's so awesome to study in @NUSLibraries now thanks to plugs on every table ^^ Thanks for the upgrade!
Omg so cute!! :) “@STcom PICTURES: #Japan condo ditches lawnmowers for grass-munching goats 
@LividEye Seriously! Maybe I really should try to complete the minor haha. I gave up cuz I was afraid of the level 3K mods from other depts
@LividEye Not popular. Gender studies is a bit more popular. There're some dubious mods like NM2201 which I took &amp; wondered how that is CS
@LividEye LOL I thought so too :p Well, ppl don't hear about it often so it is easy to forget!
@LividEye I would love to but I have no idea what career fields would be related to that hmmm
@LividEye Cultural studies is not related to languages though! It's a discipline drawing from multiple social sci and humanities disciplines
@LividEye Haha I was doing a Cultural Studies minor with just one mod to completion! It's more of I know my niche is more towards that :)
@LividEye Yesss! If there were a Cultural Studies major. I would be that rather than a Soci major haha
I miss cultural studies :(
@LividEye @chezevo Isn't Japanese quite a glamorous language mod? Together with the European and Korean languages. So hard to bid! Haha
@LividEye I can come but need to leave at 6! You are too nice le, always taking care of the food part! We should bring smth too..drinks?
@LividEye Haha they do have some nice products!
#EMAzing EXO
#EMAzing EXO
@NUSLibraries Are the library books on Level 3 accessible during that time?
@songboh :o how? If the reason is valid you might be able to claim insurance (if you bought)
@kangsheng Haha! Sociology also
Thank you kind soul that brightened the dreary morning :) 
Shazam recognised Beethoven Sonata No. 3 but Soundhound couldn't. Uninstalling the latter!
See sky is bright, put laundry into machine. When washing is almost done, see some dark clouds looming above. Noo don't rain first! #monsoon
믿어요 came up on my mp3. The first song that got me into DBSK and Kpop &lt;3 It's been 6 years :O
Erm, did Americans invent red, blonde, etc hair? And are there "American" clothes and makeup?
"You did notice that most of these girls dye their hair red, blonde, etc. and wear clothes and makeup to look more Americanized?"
@LividEye It is true. I feel like what I'm learning now is the real deal haha. Tho I'm tired &amp; stressed, I do feel intellectually fulfilled!
@LividEye Haha I got deadlines every week until wk 13. Year 4 for Soci is def the most stressful and busy!!
@LividEye Happy birthday to the one who looks young AND is young at heart! The former is not a choice and the latter is not easy to achieve!
@esti_d Yeah. And what makes it more ridiculous is that YouTube is international ground.
Girl's Generation won fair &amp; square. Some of those tweets are nasty, just cuz they think North American music is all there is in the world.
It is even more demeaning for male rape victims as well.
And when you use the popularize and normalize the word, you are trivializing the kind of fear and violence women have to live with.
You weren't taught to fear the word since young; the word doesn't pop into your head when you're out late walking on a quiet street.
When guys use the word 'rape', please consider the type of male privilege you have in this patriarchal world.
@LividEye I only know her as the fourth sister in Charmed but yes she really beautiful.Don't know what she did after the series ended though
@strawcow oh yeah Lindt is awesome. Royce' too! You gotta try their Nama chocolate if you like chocs.
@ridgefolks Hello Ern! :) p.s. my private acct is @jiayingchen and sometimes I reply from there but it's all me :)
@songboh (name of place) orh-di-im-ni-ka? = where is (name of place)
@play_nate haha that's why I always say secondary school
@ridgefolks I think nagging is ok :)
@ridgefolks Haha oh but then I'm talking abt private acct, not public acct. Just realised you're talking abt public!
@ridgefolks Sometimes ppl just drift apart &amp; are no longer on that level tt I want them to see my private tweets. Nothing to do w bitching.
@ridgefolks I have but that's because I didn't know you can block and unblock to make them unfollow you. Now I know......
@songboh @Scswga @orbigood @ridgefolks Hahaha (Y)
@orbigood @ridgefolks Haha I heard someone telling me that yesterday as well...that he didn't know what 微信 was when his PRC friend asked.
@ridgefolks I tried WeChat but I still prefer whatsapp for its simplicity.
@ridgefolks WeChat is like China's Whatsapp. Koreans use Kakaotalk and Japanese use Line messenger.
I know this is lame but where are all the awesome local food at? My overseas cousin here to visit and I hardly ever eat out... &gt;.&lt; Recs pls!
@ridgefolks I'm at home now! Heehee. What is keechew?
@techiewen @strawcow age-wise he's the same as the female year 4s haha
@ridgefolks someone had a poor connection :/
@ridgefolks Macs is scary...once you find out what kind of inedible stuff they put in their food &gt;.&lt;
@ridgefolks Hangouts is quite good. Try the function where you can put cool stamps like hats. It will hover over your head wherever you move
When the wind is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
Bawling my eyes out for the Cory tribute ep on Glee. Every cast member's personal grieving and tribute to him...and when Lea Michele sang.
@ridgefolks As a tired year 4, I simply have no time and energy to think when I get out of bed. So I pick my outfit the day before haha
@ridgefolks @crazyarnie haha but our black eyelashes will give us away!
@ridgefolks It's good practice. No such thing as being too paranoid when it comes to backing up school stuff!
@nussutheridge Yay! Gotta admit, I look forward to each new issue.
@LividEye My uncle was just telling me a few days ago how awesome that album was! I've only heard the Glee tribute versions so far.
People working in media should stop photoshopping models' faces to look so unrealistically flawless with no hint of real human skin.
Crowd is blocking the path from mrt to bus interchange. Dang.
Oh no Running Man cast at JP. I love kpop and variety but can't deny that such events are super disruptive, esp in squeezy Singapore.
All the angst towards Asus service centre for causing inconvenience to me and as an extension, the people around me :(
Called ASUS multiple times today but can't get through. They haven't called me though its been 6 working days + 2 weekends. How to do work?!
@LividEye That I have no idea haha. I shall go ask and or-hor her for you :p
@LividEye She completed but she didn't know  there's an inventory she could check if she did. She's never played games before.
@LividEye on the other hand my friend was super angsty about the second life assignment haha
@blueph0enix haha actually no need to cuz I tweet the same stuff most of the time. Just that my private acct includes more private thoughts.
@blueph0enix eh? You follow my public acct too?
The Kpop industry is what makes Marx roll in his grave. Capitalist exploitation and alienation at its finest.
SM milking the cash cow for what it's worth. Now I wonder what their contract lengths are...
WHAT. No! They need a rest! And what abt China promotions! :( “@allkpop EXO reported to be returning next month with new album”
We so cool that we have our own Soci Honors Confessions facebook page (<VICTORY HAND>ﾟ∀ﾟ)
@hellofrmSG I like their songs. The only problem is they repeat the same songs every day...but guess they're a new station so small database
@sakkksak haha I think just do things according to the dynamics of the family. No fixed tradition to follow now :)
@hellofrmSG just curious, so that means the ghost followed him to his new place? :/
@sakkksak Not much! The guy might ask/inform his parents that he wants to propose. But in this era guy's parents usually don't do the asking
Found a hardcore Potterhead who even reads 3rd gen fics :o
@sakkksak It's just the guy asking the girl's parent if I'm not wrong.
PSLE tmr... All my prayers and love are with my kid and half-kid! Already proud of them for being such loving, loveable and beloved kids.
@ridgefolks anything doesn't take up space and hopefully can be used up there so as not to burden their heavy luggages when they come back!
@ridgefolks haha yup! i like to say heyyo! like a rapper too :p
@ridgefolks Hahaha I've never seen anyone say hellow before
I got a very bad feeling that I just bricked my phone.
Android users: grainy instagram photos? Go to your profile &gt; option (top right) &gt; advanced features &gt; uncheck 'HQ image processing'
@crazyarnie since they are under the same branch of studies which is cultural studies, so yes they will prob have overlapping themes
@play_nate wah indeed
@ridgefolks Go shop around! I always like to go to the skincare sections and put moisturizer so my skin won't peel on the flight :X
@rrrandomrants haha in the end I drank Milo, with limited efficacy :/
I must be the only Singaporean who doesn't know how mee goreng looks like and that it is spicy. Now my 'spaghetti' is burning up my tongue.
If the government wants us to not treat SG as a hotel, then stop robbing us of things that make us feel like home, like places and memories.
JJ Lin is my Jay Chou.
Now that Greenfield's is finally advertising itself, lemme just proclaim that its Chocolate Malt tastes heavenly and is a must-try!
@kangsheng I'm not. They've been around for at least a year
@kangsheng they're called jeggings
I think the shuttle bus system has improved quite a lot.
@LividEye cannot say that...got marathon runners who are 70+ years old! Got regularly run then can le!
@LividEye Keep fit and healthy ma! But better to run w someone of same standard though cuz I'm very slow haha
@LividEye I wish I can half just a fraction of that desire and discipline to exercise!
@play_nate  The other prizes were good too: iPod nano, camera, hdd, shopping vouchers for all participants. 
@play_nate wah then how they pick the winner if everybody gets all correct? Lucky draw?
@songboh Hahaha am blessed with contest luck ;) Thanks!
@play_nate But you might still win smth! Last yr I didn't get all right but won like 2nd or 3rd too. Good luck!
I won Skullcandy headphones from ERDD game show! Thanks @NUSLibraries :) Learning more about e-resources too.
@crazyarnie lol it's normal not to understand readings when it comes to culture
Singapore's history is one of impt socio-cultural institutions destroyed, then leaving behind a physical remnant when no spirit is left.
Social memory reading abt the old Nanyang University. Agree that it is too forced to call NTU 南大 as if it continued from NU, when it wasn't.
&gt;:( “@STcom Fake fund-raisers still trying to solicit donations under the name of Yellow Ribbon Project 
Thank you @NEAsg for the hourly updates even till this time! #littlethings #appreciation
Stomp feeds people's desire to be moral police through unethical means of public shaming and infringement of privacy.
"E-learning week, I was intending to do smth sexy like Spying &amp; Espionage...maybe it's not that sexy." - prof of State and Society
@esti_d Yeah. The fixation with looks seems like a permanent part of their culture alr.
It's disturbing how when Korean idols describe their ideal type, it's about looks. Pretty smile, hair length, small face, etc.
Need to stop listening to awesome collegiate acappella songs and finish my readings.
@ridgefolks For Soci students at least, we are supposed to deconstruct and challenge,so it's normal for us to question and pick out problems
@ridgefolks sure isn't the case here in the arts and social sciences!
@LividEye @eisen Ah AS3 is my study haunt :) great to know that it was alr nice back then!
@LividEye @eisen When I matriculated in 2010, think ADM was alr in its decline...but the remaining parts of sch (esp fass) are still special
@eisen I thought they moved there for convenience as the course pack sales and vending machines are there. Didn't think abt ADM. Hmmm.
@eisen It got moved to central forum!
@rrrandomrants @hellofrmSG Ohh I just read abt the cadbury plant thing. Haven't had the chance to smell it though I use the mrt everyday.
@rrrandomrants @hellofrmSG I live in boon lay but I don't notice any smell...any specific part of the area that has it?
@ridgefolks The many windy, sheltered spaces for studying in Arts. I'm not fond of aircon so I love this.
I feel sad reading this as an Arts student. Other FASS peeps, thoughts? “@kangsheng I must be in the wrong faculty 
@kangsheng I don't know why but I feel very sad seeing this as an FASS student.
@LividEye @ridgefolks lozenges, creams, many diff kinds of pills, gauze, plasters. The case opp uhc cashier displays the contents.
@ridgefolks It's $20. There're gauze and plasters too
Was shocked seeing this guy with a bag full of medicine for diff ailments. Then I realised he bought a travel kit. UHC sells them. Cool.
@songboh The pri sch syllabus is a lot harder in math too. But in sec sch they will revise the same topics again. Psle serves as distinction
@ridgefolks Thriller fic, w witty humour &amp; life philosophy nicely woven in. Not your typical thriller because of its unconventional plot!
@hellofrmSG In SG there's a very strong age dimension to education. I salute those who challenge tt &amp; pursue education regardless their age!
I smelled something burnt, looked up at the sky and saw the familiar sight. Haze &gt;.&lt; and it looks bad.
@ridgefolks But my fave book series is hands-down Harry Potter. And another fave is Dean Koontz's Life Expectancy.
@ridgefolks I loved reading but since coming to uni, the large amt of reading I do killed it. Now I read on-the-go on my phone and not often
@ridgefolks yup its the intro mod to sociology
@hellofrmSG Yep he is! But so far I truly enjoyed one: Braid. I'm not the kill things or build things kinda person. I love Pokemon though!
@hellofrmSG @LividEye @play_nate @strawcow No la! I think everyone's Twitter feed is so busy that its hard to notice who's gone :)
@hellofrmSG My bf got me to try it too haha. Quite cute. But ultimately I'm too much of a non-gamer to get hooked and continue.
@ridgefolks Sociology yr 4. Came in wanting to do psych, but SC1101E changed my mind. Loving what I'm studying cuz it's so interesting.
@LividEye Your tag in inside, they have to give you no matter what! Haha
@crazyarnie Haha yup, though I find it difficult to understand some of his content sometimes. Have fun!
@crazyarnie prof Ivan Kwek?
@crazyarnie what mod are you taking?
@crazyarnie @strawcow Motorola X maybe? Just that haven't reached Singapore
@hellofrmSG I do too. I deactivate my social media accounts from time to time to liberate myself from it all.
Teenage cousin said Mario Kart is 'so yesterday' compared to Despicable Me. Um, does its 'age' matter if it is still a superior game anyway?
Think she doesn't know how to change it to something else. And it doesn't bother her enough to want to :p
Oops just realised that my mum's ringtone is Keane's Everybody's Changing because I was its previous temporary owner a few years back.
@hellofrmSG It's like neopets, just that in human form!
@hellofrmSG neopets, millsberry and habbo hotel. The rest were all educational CD ROMs which were actually very fun and interesting too!
I just wish my memory were a bit better to locate that link again, to find out why.
When a suffering living goes, the suffering transfers to the living around them.
Friend, I'm thinking of you again. Searching for the past you'd left behind but as people moved on, links to you have disappeared as well.
@LividEye I dunno when but sounds very long ago haha. I started listening to their full albums during Perfect Symmetry. Yep still awesome!
@LividEye HAHA Keane is not a very mainstream popular group so its hard to know who likes them! I like them too :)
@LividEye Oooh you like Keane too??
@hahazZ yeah me too. Confirm a lot of people going!
@hahazZ omgahhhhh I waited so long for this~
After being drenched this morn, kena-ed some dirty thing that looks a lot like bird shit on my blouse and my readings. #firstdayofclasses
I suck at bringing comfort to others. I can feel &amp; understand deeply but I don't know how to cheer people up, except being there to listen.
Fighting against problems that are not my own, yet is mine by association. Sigh.
@ridgefolks hihi I'm @jiayingchen, but accidentally tweeted you using my personal acct haha. Just a qn, why 1-to-1 lunch, not group?
@chezevo yeah, just gotta take good care of my hand from now and try not to carry heavy stuff on that hand! Thanks for your concern :))
@LividEye I've no idea what Banyan Tree is! More like Quotient Travel Planner, if you've seen their bus ads. Yep great summer :)
@LividEye I did marketing at this agency tt tailor-makes luxury travels for individual clients. Great colleagues and lots of learning opps!
@chezevo It was De Quervain's (inflammation of tendon). Can't heal fully..I can trigger it again just by putting a lot of weight on thumb :(
@LividEye what abt you?
@LividEye haha yup! Cuz I took a break from social media for a long while :) went travelling all of may, and summer internship was awesome!
@LividEye @sakkksak I can't, got an appt on :/
@ridgefolks welcome!!! :)
Watching Phantom tonight and I'm super duper excited because it's my fave musical ever. Waited 6 long years for them to come back to SG.
The Origin of "OK" 
@crazyarnie yup, which is surprising because the theme of rag was very generic - "extending love, experience nus"
@crazyarnie Lots of candy-themed floats. And I think I heard the song Candy Man 4 times.
So I'm concerned about what the kids will learn from it. Bad side of making it public. I only got to know this because my p5 tutee told me.
ABTM Ridhwan hitting gf - r/s is personal and he knows he's in the wrong so no comments. But ABTM cast is very popular among pri sch kids
@sakkksak @guanyinmiao @songboh @strawcow next Thur?
Well done everyone :) #socrag13
Bhutan is opening up. Check out their new partnership with Changi for direct flights at 
@play_nate @quacko_quack I just think quite xiong and I wasn't understanding some of the concepts. Interesting though!
@play_nate @quacko_quack yep she's been teaching that for many years. Heard lots from geog friends. I took for minor but withdrew midway
@play_nate @quacko_quack geog of social life prof is strict!
@rrrandomrants still can use to get discount at merchants :)
Can't wait to see Moto X! But I won't be getting a new phone anytime soon until my tech touch of death kills this one, but I'd rather not.
I don't like Samsung phones at all because physical home buttons annoy me. Beggars can't be choosers though and I'm super grateful for this.
No longer using my tablet phone! Using a Note kindly donated by my uncle. Running Jellybean on Slim Bean custom ROM. I'm anti-Touchwiz haha.
I don't think a lot of music nowadays capture what true love really is or feels like. They describe attraction more.
Even Goodreads has listed The Cuckoo's Calling's author as JKR. Shouldn't they use her pseudonym?
#PrayforLea I feel the loss because Glee is the only show I watch, but I feel sad when I imagine what Lea Michele must be going through now.
I'm not having carpal tunnel but De Quervain's - hurt the tendon at my thumb.
@chezevo @sopyngyf Haha except I don't know the commands for Ubuntu...I need to use the mouse because my work needs a lot of right clicks
@sopyngyf @chezevo Oh no but I need to use the mouse at work every day. Eeks.
@chezevo @sopyngyf Yup I think I'll go see in the next few days. My friend told me it can be permanent &gt;.&lt;
@sopyngyf @chezevo I started having it since Fri. I think it's because I have to keep using the mouse all day for work w/o wrist rest
@esti_d I hope not :/ But prob should go see the doc to get a wrist guard or smth
@play_nate Winnie the Pooh quotes are the best
Seems like I got a really bad case of carpal tunnel syndr. My right hand is 60% useless. Can't put weight,can't exert strength to write even
@chezevo Haha but I read it everyday ;)
@crazyarnie Wanted to but I couldn't. Wonder what's so private about commencement.
@kangsheng Ah yes... that too, though I only read about it. Sigh. I think the host countries only see them as money magnets.
I'm sure tourists will appreciate them so much more if seen in Greece than in a museum that gives only a fraction of attention to it.
I've never been to the Parthenon but I know I will feel like something's wrong, having seen what should be there somewhere else.
It's such an important part of Greek historical heritage. Thinking about the Parthenon with more than half its treasures missing is sad.
I saw the Marbles in the British Museum and I know well the significance of them, but seeing it in a museum in Britain just doesn't do it.
So as I was tweeting on my other account, I feel that the Parthenon Marbles should be returned to the Parthenon in Greece.
@crazyarnie ohhh I got it in my gmail but I couldn't open it because it was protected
Did anyone receive an email from officeofthepresident@nus.edu.sg?
Tons of campers up and about getting their 'freshman hazing'.
@songboh Haha but I feel JP is still pretty good! What's there at JEM that is diff from other malls?
@crazyarnie is that ingress? Lol
@crazyarnie ahhh oops I thought you replied to my other tweet
@strawcow it is, still.
@crazyarnie I somehow feel like females are more inclined to follow their husbands than the other way round.
Would you migrate if your spouse has a way brighter future somewhere else and an opportunity to fulfil their dreams?
@crazyarnie you got an internship in singapore?
I love the humidity &amp; warmth here. Cold, gloomy &amp; dry weather in Canada not for me. But I love their agricultural produce &amp; politeness.
@play_nate Those NUS center forum book fairs got! But don't have the first 3 :((
@LividEye @play_nate @techiewen I've been on holiday in Bali and Canada for the past month :D
@play_nate Wahhh! You have so many! Envious. I never owned them so now I'm going arnd buying secondhand ones of the first Bloomsbury covers
@LividEye @play_nate @techiewen lolol I'm a Pisces! Haha I think they never describe well. Pisces fall headfirst and heck care everything
The weather here in Mississauga has been kind thus far. Thank God!
@techiewen @play_nate Cuz ultimately girls look for certain qualities like stability. Some girls might be insecure having a cute bf too haha
@techiewen haha it's true
Gwiyomi song is playing on the MRT station's speakers o.O
@sopyngyf Haha I liked An Enemy of the People! But hated Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry.
It's 5 May! :) A special day to me for reasons other than the elections &lt;3
@esti_d Omg ever since I saw someone's screencap of his phone with this icon theme, I've been trying to find out what it is!! Thanks haha!
Feeling jittery on my way to salon because I'm gonna try a new style. Fingers crossed it won't look bad cuz I'm going travelling this month.
@sopyngyf Was it the world tour one? I think it might be the same Phantom!
@play_nate most probably too generous. Haha. Or maybe I just put apply the bellcurve to the books I read.
@crazyarnie Phantom is coming to sg. Excited!
I'M GONNA WATCH PHANTOM OF THE OPERA FOR REAL! :D
Has anyone heard of any plagiarism cases where ppl accidentally submitted someone else's report as their own?
@esti_d OMG your tweet got featured on SA! Haha. The one about not watching SA. The irony.
@sopyngyf Hahaha I don't mind cause those are my study breaks :P
I love watching Star Awards! HAHA.
@frezb Yepp! Potterhead forever ^^
@play_nate I can't find the full interview :o
@LividEye @strawcow Yeah it's no joke. If you still can't adjust, at least make sure there's someone to give you a call to check you're up.
@play_nate ok I watched part 1 and I desperately need to sleep but ahhhhh so interesting
@play_nate I knew Hermione is supposed to resemble her, but never heard anything about her mother.
@play_nate Haha don't spoil, I'll go watch the interview tmr! But sounds like an awesome one.
@play_nate Nope I haven't! I shall go watch. Yeah it didn't seem apparent what her religious inspiration was till the last book.
Harry Potter &lt;3 I'm not ashamed if one day employers ask me what my fave book is and I name this children's book series.
I think she weaved it in really well. I like how she makes the book mean smth personal to her, yet is relevant to all 
"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Jesus (Matthew 6:21 NIV)

@techiewen @LividEye @bordeauxblack @crazyarnie @play_nate @sakkksak @sopyngyf John's eyes are closed!
@crazyarnie I sense sociology
@LividEye Haha I finished the pepero at YIH alr! And I'm holding the block of toblerone. Gonna share the love w other mugging friends.
I'm not used to typing on such a small screen, after a few months on my tablet. So many spelling errors.
@play_nate Haga actually that is a sign of panic-induced escapism. You need to block yourself from the distractions! @crazyarnie
Thanks @LividEye for all the treats again! :) Great tweetup the tweetpeeps who came!
Every kid I've tutored in the home are blessings in my life, and I hope I've blessed them as well. Please grow up well, all my darlings.
Happy birthday to my lil kiddo :) Grow up well, M. All your volunteer jiejies are sending you live from wherever they are &lt;3
@LividEye Yeah. He said if we interview him, we must let him do our brows. We just showered loads of praises to get him to talk haha!
@LividEye I interviewed Steven Lim once back in 2007 for a sec sch proj, back when he was a eyebrow stylist at orchard. He was hilarious.
Oh the 1-for-1 is only for house brands. *disappointed*
Omg Watsons storewide 1-for-1! So this was what their SMS was about! Accidentally deleted before I read it &gt;.&lt; *auntie mode on*
@esti_d Yup. Or confide in friends. There are some who have close friends around but they chose to struggle alone.
I think within me is a little anger that you chose not to say anything; a little sadness that you felt death was the only escape.
There are listening ears, but one has to be willing to say it too.
I can't help thinking about my friend after hearing the suicide incident.
Body all screwed up. Is it really just stress or smth more serious? :/
@LividEye @bordeauxblack @crazyarnie @play_nate @quacko_quack @sakkksak @songboh @sopyngyf @strawcow haha been tweeting more on private acct
@LividEye @bordeauxblack @crazyarnie @play_nate @quacko_quack @sakkksak @songboh @sopyngyf @strawcow and guys also like strawberry! Hahaha
@LividEye @bordeauxblack @crazyarnie @play_nate @quacko_quack @sakkksak @songboh @sopyngyf @strawcow haha wht has flavor got to do w gender?
@LividEye @strawcow @play_nate 
@strawcow @LividEye Nope not TVB, though got one HK actor inside.
@play_nate @LividEye Hearing it is not even half as disgusting as watching it &gt;.&lt;
@LividEye Oh it's not a HK drama, is from China de
@LividEye 蒸人 is not new ah? I guess I didn't watch enough palace dramas... but steaming a human in a steamer v gross *puke* @play_nate 
This punishment in 步步惊心 is damn gross... Why must they link it to food. Don't think I can look at dim sum the same way again.
@LividEye Haha indeed. When I have assignments due, I use this blocking program to block me from websites until a date/time.
@LividEye Haha it's actually not as hard. It's just the initial inertia on Day 1. I have done quite a few social media fasts before.
Kinokuniya (esp the children's books section) is my magical place of escape from this world.
@sakkksak Hahaha I shall ask hanniel to show me the end product!
夜深感触多。
@LividEye @bordeauxblack @quacko_quack @sakkksak @techiewen I'm 22 and my liking for sugar is already starting to decline
@LividEye @quacko_quack haha as a non-coffee drinker, that is the only thing in Starbucks I drink
@techiewen Haha get through the tutorial, then ask your faction members to teach you! There are many NUS players :)
@techiewen It is quite difficult to start. I have a bunch of hardcore Ingress friends to teach me and help me level up. So are you alr in?
I might as well submit my condo's fountain as a portal. #ingress
I wish Niantic can exercise more discretion in approving portals. Seriously, making somebody's house gate as a portal?! You are kidding me.
@LividEye Yeah should quit it! Maybe start by minimizing the cups of coffee drunk a day?
Considering whether to use Ingress as my topic for Cultural Studies final essay. Hmm.
Don't think he thought I am mainland Chinese cuz he wouldn't ask if I were Chinese. Probably from some other Southeast Asian countries.
This uncle asked if I was Chinese. I said I was, then he said he thought I was a foreigner. So what did he think I was?
@nussutheridge Oh wow I didn't know!
@rrrandomrants assignment
What is more detrimental: hunger or unhealthy snacks?
I really don't like to snack, that's all. And in the middle of the night, I don't wanna go cook. Can only spam water.
Ppl who gain weight in uni are those who like to snack. Ppl like me just get skinnier cuz we'll skip meals when stressed and no snacks.
@LividEye Haha interesting! Kindness is definitely worth paying forward :)
@LividEye Think they just don't like fancy schtuff haha
@LividEye I had a saviour who helped edit my entire video through the night and solved all my tech problems. Wouldn't have made it on my own
@LividEye Yup I did! Met with a ton of problems on the way like burn disk wrongly, format wrong etc, but safely submitted on time :D
Yay SociSoc giving out free Ben &amp; Jerry ice cream to Soci shirt owners on Fri! :D It's like compensating me for missing out on Free Cone Day
@LividEye Haha on the contrary, I heard there are some lecturers who don't really like Prezi.
Submitted. Phew.
@LividEye Thank you!! :) I'll try my best
@frezb thanks Ning Xi :)
@rrrandomrants *hugs*
@LividEye Don't have the narration script and voice recording yet. I got the video footages alr, super lucky cuz sure cannot film today.
@ridgefolks @rrrandomrants @LividEye Thanks all! I will get through this as steadily as possible!
@LividEye Am gonna try to learn the most basic. Argh what I hate most is that the video needs narration too. Gotta make it all fit.
@LividEye Yup and I'm using premiere pro which I'm still a beginner at. Was gonna have my friend help me but its too last min to get help.
I'm thankful that God is looking after me in my carelessness. What are the odds of a guest lecturer reminding us abt assignment deadline?
@LividEye Yeah this is such a nightmare D:
@rrrandomrants Thanks jiayan! Lucky my next deadline is Wed, but I think no sleep for tonight and tomorrow night.
.@esti_d It's my fault. I recorded the date wrongly on my calendar. Thank God the lecturer mentioned though. I wouldn't have known anything.
Need to make a video and write an essay in 24 hours. Left lecture early and cancelled tuition. Trying to calm myself down.
I've barely done anything for it cuz I have 2 other assignments this week. My head is really hurting in anxiety.
Having a huge headache now...I thought my project deadline is next Tue. During lecture, lecturer said deadline is tomorrow.
This show got me aww-ing here and there. But I think I'll start crying since I'm more than halfway through alr...
@sopyngyf It's an instant messaging programme cuz school banned MSN
@sopyngyf Hahaha oh yeah last time I also watch drama during recess on the tablet pc! And the days of using ebuddy during lesson time :P
@ridgefolks Haha I live practically beside NTU but here I am in NUS...
My ability to watch drama and do homework at the same time only works in primary and secondary school :(
十四爷! :)
@crazyarnie @LividEye @songboh @sopyngyf @strawcow ok :)
@songboh haha i'm watching on YouTube! Yeah I also started watching cuz of the new part. But part 2 is not a continuation, I heard.
@LividEye Oh mannn :( Got time to do?
@strawcow I'm halfway through it and it's pretty good so far
@LividEye Hahaha never go up to her and say you cited her in your thesis?
Finally watching 步步惊心 though it probably isn't a good time to start a drama. But I need it to destress haha.
"If there ever comes a day when we can't be together, keep me in your heart, I'll stay there forever." - Winnie-the-Pooh, A. A. Milne
Love Winnie the Pooh quotes because they're sweet. They also have a depressive undertone though. Which may explain why I like them so much.
@LividEye Why does your location always show you at Johore? Haha
Great knowledge comes when you are intentional in acquiring it.
Did filming for ssa project in Chinatown Complex wet market. And I learned so much abt Chinatown although I stayed here 20 years of my life
@LividEye lol yeah I forgot to fill it in.. will go fill up later! @crazyarnie @sopyngyf
@LividEye @chezevo HAHA congrats, remember to announce when the baby is born! Soon liao!
@ridgefolks Jiayou! Do try to catch up!
@rrrandomrants SSA1208! Everyday Lives of Chinese Singaporeans: Past and Present :D Very interesting mod!
@LividEye Doesn't taste better, but greater appreciation for it!
@LividEye @crazyarnie @play_nate @sopyngyf I will def come though! Maybe study period, ppl need free coffee even more!
@kangsheng LOL rare Pokemon! Okay la got rarer ones - the Xinghua group!
Awesome SSA lecture on Singapore Chinese Food culture. Now I'm buying Hainanese chicken rice after watching a documentary of its origin :D
@kangsheng Haha so you're Hainanese? The lecture made me so hungry...
@LividEye @crazyarnie @play_nate @sopyngyf I think reception might not be good. Really busy time for most ppl.
Plays 3 awesome pranks on the 3 closest people to me! Lots of fun for everyone in the end hahaha
Google Maps Treasure Map view and Street View! And Google Nose! They are always so creative :D
@frezb yep!
@rrrandomrants HAHA this is the only way to prank smart people who are hard to fool
@strawcow INCEPTION. Hahaha
I know. I'll keep acting like I'm gonna prank him so he'll be on suspicious mode all the time. And in the end, no prank. That's the prank.
@crazyarnie @strawcow I'm already like that usually *exposed*
@crazyarnie @strawcow Hahaha. Maybe I can show him a diamond ring catalogue and ask him to buy one for me.
@strawcow hahaha it's an interesting idea, but yeah he won't be fooled cuz he knows I wouldn't do that when we're still young @crazyarnie
@ridgefolks I'm only doing inequalities and cultural studies, cuz I cleared everything else (am year 3). You?
He did an epic phone prank on me last year. Need to get back at him!
I can't think of anything to prank my boyfriend with! Posting here so he doesn't know...anyone got ideas?!
@techiewen Aw man, I didn't get the chance to act like a god and now my birthday month's over too :(
@ridgefolks Whoots hi fellow Soci major! :)
@chezevo @ridgefolks LOL sounds like class will be really exciting tmr. Though they should prob focus on finishing the report at this time!
@chezevo Miscomm always leads to trouble. So both the girlfriend and boyfriend in the same group, but girlfriend is in the whatsapp chat?
@chezevo Wow sounds very drama
@ridgefolks It's 'kay! I wished I could've replied more but I was super busy myself too &gt;.&lt;
@esti_d Yeah but most of the songs they sang this season are quite old. Too few good mandarin songs in the past few yrs for them to pick?
These kids are singing songs from MY sec sch times. A sign that the quality of mandopop songs have generally degraded over the years?
So I watched 5 mins of Campus Superstar to reminisce. Gosh, the last season was back in sec sch :O
@kangsheng why isn't it special anymore?
One can never understand the pain of those who chose to take their lives. Still trying to accept and move on. Still, imagery haunts.
@ridgefolks Read tech articles on Google Currents app
Good Friday is a time to appreciate the two things in life that cure problems: God's love and sleep :)
MP3 player affected by the rain too. All the slow songs about heartbreaks and melancholy...
Black dri-fit tees are great for days when you have no umbrella and you gotta run in the rain. Other days, it makes you hot and stinky.
@crazyarnie It is. Thunder in Jurong West now.
@LividEye Wah so extreme o.O @songboh
@songboh So kiasu. I never get it when people submit individual essays with front page too.
Isn't ask.fm like formspring?
Wii U just reminds of the sound of cat-calling. Wii U Wii!
Nothing beats good home-cooked food!
I still love Jesse McCartney's songs.
Got my issue of @nussutheridge to read on the long way to CCA ^^
@LividEye I want pepero! Haha. I can't see what @sopyngyf says cuz private acct!
Canon in D played using the original Baroque instruments and techniques. Stunning. 
Turning my frown upside down :)
@ridgefolks I listen to Canon in D and River Flows In You sometimes when I'm in a state of panic. Most times, silence works best.
Totally excited about Phantom in Singapore!!! :D I've waited 6 years for you!
@ridgefolks Me too! I'm a Phan! Caught Love Never Dies in West End, staring Ramon Karimloo. Don't like the plot but Ramin was awesome!

Should be doing work but both heart and mind is on something else.
@chezevo Nah actually I had this acct awhile before @ridgefolks came into being, to tweet to celebs and stuff. But I deleted them alr haha.
@ridgefolks Won't get married there, but will probably take some wedding shots there.
@ridgefolks yeah while i appreciate honesty, i think being too public abt every thought and feeling on fb sets one up for unwanted judgement
@ridgefolks Haha I love NUS! But there's too many reasons why...perhaps it's how it's such a vibrant environment with many diff types of ppl
@ridgefolks I once saw an ad for a playmate. Just need to play with a toddler and speak Mandarin to him. $30/h. Too bad it was too far.
@ridgefolks I teach pri school but that's cuz I do like playing around with kids even if they are fidgety and noisy haha. Passion + $
@ridgefolks For the amount of time put in, yeah. For pri sch,you can earn up to $25/hour. It's actually quite chill, unless you take pri sch

@ridgefolks I worked as an usher for a while, then went to do tutoring instead. Higher pay and I enjoy it more.
@ridgefolks Floo! /potter fan-mode activated/
@ridgefolks Every sunday night I need to do a response to y readings and post it on the forum b4 the prof wakes for our Monday morning class
@ridgefolks what was your most unforgettable moment in nus?
@ridgefolks I like tech stuff and I don't think that makes anyone boring! You've been very interesting, enjoyed your tweets! :)
@ridgefolks Love is not a thing, it's an act - giving in spite of yourself.
@ridgefolks But that was just my fac oweek. Really depends on the OGLs. There were camps with great OGLs who cared abt bonding the freshies
@ridgefolks I was one of the less rah rah kind during oweek. Got bad impression cuz OGLs only talk to the more interesting or pretty ones.
@ridgefolks I started using it after I started using a tablet too. The app is actually really good.
It's 3 days into the recess week, but two days before submission of an essay #dontwannafacereality
Seriously the moment Nokia decides to adopt Android, I will run out and buy it.
@ridgefolks Active! Now that I'm a senior, I sacrifice some time that I could use for school activities, socializing&amp;studies for tuition $$.
@ridgefolks Cliched but Deck Yong Tau Foo. Tasty, not oily, and you get enough veggie intake for the day! And extremely pocket-friendly.

@ridgefolks We had 5 bday girls &amp; we were each others' guests. Had 21 cupcakes, blew out the candles tgt. And we paid 1/5 of total costs :)
@ridgefolks I think my 21st was pretty cool. Held a bday party with 4 other best friends from sec sch who also turned 21 in the same month.
Considering whether to buy Nexus 4. $400 without contract is very tempting since my phone died only 6 months after recontracting.
Think we'll be pretty hyped up about Dr Goh's WP rally speech in his class next week ;)
@septembreneuf @ridgefolks Harry Potter was the topic for my essay for Sociology of Popular Culture too!
@ridgefolks Thanks Gwen! Really enjoyed your tweets. May you graduate on time haha
@ridgefolks There might be many more who want to reply, but wish to keep their accounts protected. I'm now using my public acct to reply.
