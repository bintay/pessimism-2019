Fell asleep during a movie at daniels, woke up at 230, drove home, &amp; now I'm wide fucking awake. Hey y'all
Im done with this movie. Playing with Mila instead. Nope
Over a fucking car. A. Car. wtf.
I'm watching John sick &amp; I'm throughly upset they just killed a puppy
Cravings are mad real bro 
1200 left
Counting down the seconds until I get off
Me 
I'm not even a mom yet &amp; I'm already getting spoiled for Mother's Day. God, I love my boyfriend <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
@sydkilo you don't even look black anymore bro
Keep assuming stuff about me. See how far that'll getcha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Although most of it was already together
If I do nothing else productive today, I put together Mila's nursery center &amp; that's enough for me 
@jaenicdee I'm going to cfa fugg it
Every time I see a pink elephant I have to buy it for Mila. It's just a must
@_chelsed I will die if she has daniels eyes <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
When me &amp; Daniel get married, I'm getting Mila a custom dress similar to mine <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@jaenicdee they tasted funny &amp; I'm still hungry <CRYING FACE>
@_chelsed omg look <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@jaenicdee it already happened though <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> 
@_chelsed nope. Doing it right now.
@_chelsed I spend entirely too much time looking at mixed babies trying to determine what she's gonna look like
Moxed <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@_chelsed babies, yes. But when she gets older it's not gonna be fun <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
Possibly middle school if she has her fathers eyes.
Like I'm buying a gun the second my daughter starts high school. Not letting niggas be all over her. No no no no.
I'll still love her with every ounce of my being, but after being friends with a black ginger for 6 years I'm afraid to raise one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@_chelsed brb crying <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Daniel has a ginger beard. Is it bad that I'm afraid I might have created a ginger baby?
@_chelsed OMG IM GOING TO CRY. YOULL BE HERE FOR MY SHOWER AND HER BEING BORNT. IM SO SO HAPPY OMGGGGG <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@_chelsed I've literally been freaking out thinking you still leave the 12th. I hate you. But still love you. When do you leave?!
Chelse's one of my favorite people. Legitimately
@_chelsed yessss lets do that <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@_chelsed I feel like it's gonna be thick &amp; curly &amp; I'm not gonna be able to tame her mane <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Considering the fact that she's gonna be white, Hispanic, &amp; black I'm not sure what it's gonna be like &amp; that gives me legitimate anxiety
I'm not looking forward to dealing with Mila's hair for 18 years <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
&amp; I did it on accident. Didn't realize I didn't take my medicine until I started eating.
Today's the first day since before I got pregnant that I could wake up, eat whatever I want (without meds) &amp; not throw up. I'm so happy <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@jaenicdee nah you straight I got ramen remember <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
It's so cute that daniel tries to control what I eat since I'm pregnant with his kid. Most of the time I listen to <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@jaenicdee well unless Marinelli wants to buy me food it's all I got <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@jaenicdee wait why not? Did I tell you Daniel doesn't let me? Or are you referring to something else? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I've never read something so relevant to my life before 
@jaenicdee I hate you. I'm making ramen
This makes me so happy 
Now you see me is like my favorite movie ever
@jaenicdee lol a large pizza sounds a lot more than $15 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I'll pay someone in pizza to help me rearrange my room tomorrow
Not looking forward to the drive from daniels house to mine <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
My face refuses to clear up <POUTING FACE>
@JodyeFlacko_ unfollow me. Doesn't have shit to do with you
If you can go 1+ day(s) without talking to me easily, don't be offended when I don't consider you a close friend.
Although I'm pretty sure she's not gonna wait that long.
80 more days till D-day <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@a_6284 lol omg you're my fav <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><OK HAND SIGN>
Mila lives in my ribs dude <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> short pregnant girl probz
Hey andolyn, unlock your tweets so I can rt that perfect tweet. Like really <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I just want to be able to eat what I want, when I want <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Just one.
Please give me a reason to cut you out of my life for good.
This is the latest I've woken up in forever
So basically the usual
Watching old episodes of Grey's until I fall asleep <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Too nauseous for life right now
@jaenicdee 
Just because we were cool before I got pregnant doesn't mean you're gonna be around my daughter. Fuck outta here
You're crazy if you think you're going to be a part of my child's life
Found a picture of @sydkilo in her natural habitat 
Fucking up daniels kd cause I'm bored <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Fuck both of y'all's happy, optimistic asses @sydkilo @jaenicdee 
Waiting for this yung Benadryl to kick in like <FLUSHED FACE>
Keep sleeping on white boys for "being controlling" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Like no matter how mad he gets its always over something revolving around my well being.
Daniels legitimately mad that I didn't spend the night at his house. So glad these are the things we argue about compared to other things
Fun fact of the day: I sleep with my eyes open if I lose the fight of sleep
At one point I woke up to Sydney's mom staring at me trying to figure out if I was awake or asleep <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@daveChiefin you're probably right
Hey my mom finally opened the door
Ironically didn't see a single cop
In other news: idk of its cause it's Saturday night or bc of the fight, but the streets were full af. Like it was only 9 or 10. It was weird
SLEEPING IN MY CAR CAUSE MY MOM HATES ME K BYE
I fell asleep in Sydney's bed before the fight even started
I've legit called 50x &amp; rang the doorbell even more. Plus I have to pee due to being 7 months pregnant. Y'all don't understand the anger rn
My mom has this lock that even if you have a key you can't get in.... It's on right now &amp; she won't wake up to come take it off
My shoes untied &amp; I can't maneuver around Mila to tie it <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
So the derby is on the tv at work for some reason &amp; I feel like this is really inhumane. Is it just me?
Low key gonna miss my job when I have to stop working 
Extremely nice barista just gave me &amp; daniel 6 free cake pops &amp; a piece of banana nut bread for free
Jk found one of me &amp; sydney <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
I would post a picture from prom but is it frowned upon to crop my ain't shit date out? Like I feel like it would seem like a shot fired
Mila's gonna be an only child. Sorry Daniel. Not going through this again. No fucking way.
2 &amp; a half hours into my third trimester &amp; my nausea &amp; facial bleeding is already back with a vengeance.
So now we're at Walmart buying me a new one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Oh jk he found it. In the middle of cedar. Run over.
Daniel pumped my gas &amp; somehow lost my gas cap .....
Reasons why I hate my boyfriend sometimes: 
PANDESAL IS BAE <REVOLVING HEARTS>
I was wearing a sports bra &amp; boy shorts. Totally not a nude
@jaenicdee I was gonna post that on here <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> it isn't a nude!
He refuses to pay for a wedding <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I told my dad the wedding dress I want is 5k &amp; he said he'd pay me that amount for me &amp; Daniel to elope <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> that wasn't an option <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
Going to spend the rest of my night reading 50 pages on real estate law k bye
“@PrincessStyIe: The way it should be <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
After I have Mila I WILL get back to the weight I was back in high school. No reason to sit around &amp; be depressed anymore <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

“@jaenicdee: This summer, it's going to be me and my money.. <MONEY BAG>” &amp; Yancy &amp; Mila
THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND IS NOT GETTING THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES 
You're a joke
@jaenicole_x were gonna lay around &amp; watch old episodes of Grey's forever
I wanna punch whoever said nausea ends after the beginning of your second trimester.
@sydkilo oh hey Phyllis
@JodyeFlacko_ stahhhhhhp <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Currently in the hospital &amp; I have class at 9 &amp; work at 4. Tomorrow should be great
<SPOUTING WHALE>&lt;-- me 
Start classes to get my real estate license tomorrow too <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I've grown up so much in 6.5 months it's weird.
This time last year I was smoking blunt after blunt with Rae daily &amp; now all I do is look at baby stuff &amp; watch movies with my boyfriend <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I feel like I've been pregnant foreverrrrrr
@JodyeFlacko_ July 24th is 3 months away <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Gawwwwwd these 3 months are gonna go by so slow
I enjoy nothing more than sitting back &amp; watching Daniel talk to Mila. I swear I've never loved someone more <SPARKLING HEART>
@jaenicole_x so glad to see you doing better bby <SPARKLING HEART>
@KianaClevee well damn. Is it the smartest thing to watch this pregnant &amp; extra emotional? <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Watching the fault in our stars for the first time. Pray for me
@daveChiefin well damn dude <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm sorry
You can just look at my page &amp; see daniel &amp; baby shit everywhere. What about that says "oh let's slide in her messages?!"
I wouldn't care if this wasn't the 3rd time this has happened in one week <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@daveChiefin then choose a girl that isn't pregnant &amp; in a relationship. Would you want your girl just "talking" to a random nigga?!
Daniel &amp; Mila are literally all I post about on fb. Wtf. 
I love going on ppl (who I haven't talked to since high school) pages &amp; see that I'm blocked. Lol who hurt you sweetheart?
What is sleep?
@SunStarChild congrats beautiful <BLUE HEART>
@sydkilo sounds about right <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@sydkilo how did I not notice you taking it
@sydkilo why we're your shoes off lololol
Shopping for bathing suits while pregnant is so depressing
#1 reason why I love my job: 
Why am I just discovering workaholics. This show's gr8
“@sydkilo: u dont need advice from my man thats why u got Jesus helllooooo”
@SunStarChild very true!
So yeah I tried on bathing suits today &amp; decided I'm not going swimming while pregnant at all
@SunStarChild exactly. There's literally an infinite amount of other things I can spend that on that I actually need.
Like why. Just why.
The baby shower invites I want cost $54. Is it just me or is that a tad bit fucking much?!
I wanna vent &amp; eat macaroni with her for the rest of my life
Sydney is bae 4 lyfe
I love Lilo &amp; Stitch wayyyy too much to be almost 20
&amp; I can't take my meds because I'm pregnant. Great
My allergies literally came out of nowhere this year.
Can't see em but hey anythings better than what they were <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I can't paint my own toe nails so daniel does it for me. I legitimately love this kid <GREEN HEART>
Although I'm sure they won't in like 2 weeks
My shorts from last year still fit me thanks to belly bands <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> 
Buying baby stuff makes me feel so damn productive
Someone bring me food to Athens
I have work at 1030 &amp; I'm still in my jammies
Mila's doing some weird shit this morning <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Nicole_Schultzz I love you so much more now that I know you listen to tdh <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Wcw <REVOLVING HEARTS> 
If your birthday's on April fools you're a joke
Morning sickness doesn't have you in the hospital 2-3x a week.
I hate when people call my HG morning sickness. I wish I had just morning sickness.
@SunStarChild well you gained it in all the right places &amp; look amazing <REVOLVING HEARTS>
@SunStarChild girl I'm that big now at 6 months. You're tiny for about to pop!
The opposite of love isn't hate. It's indifference
Can't wait to tell daniel he can't smoke on 4/20. If I can't smoke neither can he <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I'm too entertained by kids movies to almost be 20

Idk if I'm just crazy, but it really irks me when girls I haven't talked to in forever or girls I'm not friends with follow daniel on ig
The first three seasons of greys make me so incredibly happy

 
He uses my pregnancy pillow more than me 
So child pornography is funny now?
Nachos &amp; hot wings r bae
Why can't there be a 24 hour Chinese food restaurant?!
@sydkilo we established this when you first met him.
What pleasure do you get from cursing a child that's not even born yet? You're the lowest specimen on this earth
If you talk shit about an unborn baby you're a fucking cunt &amp; I hope you die
@ZaydaaB but you're gorgeous <WEARY FACE>
Next Friday, I will have been pregnant for half of a year. Oh mah gawd
“@BluntPorn: RT if you want a hit 
The only thing that wakes him up is Mila kicking &amp; of course she can't help a bitch out

@eye_candirain omg it happens everywhere. I had nooooo idea.
&amp; it's even worse now that I'm pregnant
The Walmart in hickory is the worst.
I didn't know anybody gave af about racism until I started dating a white boy. You wouldn't believe the stares we get.
Daniel fell asleep on my belly &amp; Mila keeps kicking his head &amp; it's the cutest thing ever 
Pasta makes me happy
Words can't describe how anxious I am to see how Daniel &amp; me combined into a tiny human is going to look
In my daily prayer I pray that Mila is of course born healthy &amp; happy, but has some variation of daniels blue eyes too. Is that vain?
I love waking up to baby kicks <REVOLVING HEARTS>
