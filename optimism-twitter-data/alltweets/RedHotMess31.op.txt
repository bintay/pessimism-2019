@nv7281 All good. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@VeganTaylor @nv7281 Now Now.. Let's all agree to disagree. <ROOSTER><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@nv7281 thanks. But I am not sharing my vegan bacon with you <WINKING FACE>
@nv7281 thanks. Totally off topic. But great way to smooth our disagreement.
@nv7281 @VeganTaylor I agree. Some of it is to the greatest.... But that's with anything
@nv7281 probably. I agree with the climate change. It's natural for the earth. To a degree. We just should try not to accelerate it.
@nv7281 @VeganTaylor "vegan food sucks" is insulting.We made a choice not to torture and kill our food.Not saying "meat eaters are assholes"
@nv7281 @VeganTaylor @msnbc Not to mention the mass production of waste. Antibiotics in our meat.. Read what's in your milk.
@nv7281 @VeganTaylor @msnbc Not all vegans do it for climate change. Ethical reasons and the fact that we waste gallons of water.
@nv7281 @VeganTaylor @msnbc And you are ignorant. Vegan food does not suck and do some research on the impact of factory farming.
@krishitchcock I've got your back <WINKING FACE>
@FinsandFluke I hate this.
@McSniper66 Or for people that Donate AND raise awareness. Like I did.

@maik3r I go at night. Anything helps. It's not easy finding the time. And doing it at home is distracting.
@maik3r thanks. It is!! Hitting the gym the next 3 days at least.
Long. Hard. Weird day. Skipped the gym and doing sit-ups in my scrubs. #DETERMINED 
There is no norm.... It's a crazed version of insanity. - "none of your business" thanks Waldo <WINKING FACE>
Madness.....
Slow down... Done be so serious. And laugh a lot! Life is stressful enough.
@neversleeps29 I know <WINKING FACE>

At the gym sweating like a whore in church. #WorkoutWednesday #workhardplayhard
@itsamyth1 The thing is. I like her. She's nice. BUT when it comes to eating I can't handle it!!! And my headache is so bad I may cry!! Lol
Less than two weeks.. I. Can't. Wait. 
The loud chewer is extra loud today. Even managing to make drinking water an amplified production!!! Help!!! <POUTING FACE>
I hate Wednesdays. No reason why, but today I am optimistic it will be a good day. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
Another day of craziness. Let's see what today brings!!!
@jamesgotjokes <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> there are a few more I am sure we can think of. Lol
@jamesgotjokes @LoriLuvsShoes that was a horrible time in history I would like to forget. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@maik3r thanks. I love it. Was a cover up
@neversleeps29 TMI for you!? Lol
@maik3r nope. Here is another. I have a few. 
@neversleeps29 you are awesome. Thank you. Thank you. I would climb him like a red wood. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ whew
@maik3r not intentional. However the artist I use does a lot of that. I told him my idea band have him free range. He's amazing

               ...and excite men
Long hard days are best erased... #TattooTuesday 
@SpencerWaasBand have a safe and fun trip!!! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@51ShadesOfBrown I just told him to give you a raise. <WINKING FACE> middle men are always under appreciated.
@51ShadesOfBrown Apparently he is spot on. Women love a man who can make them laugh.
@51ShadesOfBrown that's he WORST pickup line I have ever heard! Yet I am laughing.
I am not the type of person that can watch #50ShadesOfGrey in the theater. I like my freedom and don't look good in orange. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
There will always be someone to pick up the fallen pieces and make you smile again. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
When someones voice can turn your day around. Make you relax and smile. And feel as if you aren't thousands of miles away. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@madbritian1969 yea. I agree. People aren't acting like their normal lovely selves. <CONFUSED FACE>
@madbritian1969 @peta LOVE it. They all deserve a good life. They can't make their own choices.
