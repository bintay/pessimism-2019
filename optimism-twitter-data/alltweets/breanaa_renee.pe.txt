I'm just sick of people being upset because of they way their body looks and not caring about their true health
They're are plenty of people out there that starve themselves and have a flat stomach but that not healthy
Just because you have a flat stomach does not mean you are necessarily healthy
You don't. You can have some stomach rolls and still be healthy
People brainwash these young girls into thinking they have to have a flat stomach to be healthy
None of that should matter but how healthy you are should
Girls will be 120 pounds but they're not happy because they look "fat"
And I don't mean just their facial feature but the way their body looks
I think the problem nowadays is that people care too much about what they look like
