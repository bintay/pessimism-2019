Ignorance truly is bliss.
Essentially, nothing matters on the grand scale of things. It only has value that you perceive it to have.
Millions of years from now all the drugs you did or didn't do won't matter. All that money you made won't mean a thing.
I laugh when people talk down on someone else for any reason. Like what they do is so much more universally important than anyone else.
We live in a society perpetuating the notion that achievement=happiness, that financial gain=success. We worship a made up system.
I just do things. I'm like a dog chasing cars...I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it, ya know?
