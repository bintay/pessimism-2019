"I'll be 5 minutes" is one of the most overused lies ever
Mulgrew and Muller are a pair of pricks
A Mulgrew suspension is the best thing to happen for us, what a dickhead
Canny even stand on a cunt right Jesus Christ
Whoever told Mulgrew (Lennon) he was CM musta been fleeing, just let's people run by him off the ball, doesn't know how to mark or pass
We were aw over the place there man, do all the hard work then it's a defensive mishap
That's been coming!! Composure and a classy finish, YES ANYAAAA!!!!!!

Looks to me like man Utd are panic buying (falcao)
That's amazing from Moreno!!
Amean poor boys scored an OG and he acts like that? Pure dick
Diego Costa is class but he's a pure wanker
1st win of the season <VICTORY HAND>️ 
Must have a sad life if your one of those twitter accounts that kids on they've got sources about transfers by copying SSN <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Mental how you can get beat in 2 games and still have a chance of going through, madness
The fixtures could be favourable for England, if they beat Costa Rica by a few, and Italy beat Uruguay it's possible, and if Italy beat CR
So..... that sending off eh?
So deserved man
Guy gets knocked out, still justified by the commentators, this is fucking horrible to listen to
