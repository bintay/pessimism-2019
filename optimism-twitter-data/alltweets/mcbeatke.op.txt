Glad @MrReedAP is the bball commissioner.

@jaceforsyth @ForsythGarth @JoelPelt final score?
@jheiding still a bad time. That's when I mark in Edmonton.

@jheiding have you ever stumbled across a great #edtech conference in your twitter travels? In looking to spend some PD$ #MajorTrip
You da man! @Rikjesse 
@jheiding #Iwas14. More importantly, Dumb &amp; Dumber was released. Even more importantly, Dumb &amp; Dumber To (not a typo) is in production.
@AIRMILES that makes sense. Both Shell stations where our #AirmilesCash was denied were Mac's Stores.
@Shell_Canada Great. Thx. Station was located at 2515 Highlands Rd W Lethbridge, AB T1J4X4.
@mearchibald apparently it's to reduce head injuries. Stats prove a good portion of them happen on special teams.

@MBekks &amp; @Tschritter33 this is what I was talking about last wknd - 
@JoelPelt for what its worth, it was entertaining. Fumbles, interceptions, blocked FG &amp; a last minute TD. Keep improving, peak for playoffs.

@Hanskies no need to come after 6pm on Fri. Sat need help from 8am-4pm. I'll take whatever you can give. Probs can get you a free T-shirt.
@SneedJamie that's not the intent of the clear path rule. It's to aid the scorer &amp; give them FTs &amp; possession. Eliminates intentional fouls.
Maybe I have rose coloured glasses but I don't think #MJ ever complained about calls like @KingJames #JustPlay
@NBA needs to institute the clear path foul like #FIBA Too many hacks in the open court to prevent a layup.
