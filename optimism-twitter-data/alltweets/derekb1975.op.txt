@FindShotFirst independence day
@SondraWeisberg I am just looking for my pom poms ha ha I had them out earlier ha ha
@thebatdad76 @TomMcLellan24 yes mine too Winter Soldier is fantastic
@Cherri2290 I am so sorry
@thebatdad76 @TomMcLellan24 winter soldier is my favourite marvel movie Age of Ultron wouldn't make top 5
Finally home!!!
@SondraWeisberg I can always start a cheer leading squad for you GIMME A S ha ha
@SondraWeisberg no problem you deserve it you ever need some support I'm your guy ha ha
@TomMcLellan24 Whedon knows how to write the beauty and the beast romantic angle I did like the arc of hulk &amp; black widow
@TomMcLellan24 yes the go to sleep line is hilarious
@TomMcLellan24 well Whedon done that sort of arc back in buffy he knows how to write it
@TomMcLellan24 there are some fantastic action scenes the hulk vs hulkbuster is my favourite
@TomMcLellan24 that is the problem the stuff with Thor in the middle should have been left to a solo film
@thebatdad76 @TomMcLellan24 I would say I was slightly disappointed in ultron
@TomMcLellan24 and it doesn't fit
@TomMcLellan24 I loved the first one from the first screening but this one is jumping around a lot trying to fit everything in
@SondraWeisberg you know we will love anything you decide to do you are multi talented after all <WHITE SMILING FACE>
Just out from #AvengersAgeOfUltron I liked it but I didn't love it a bit messy in the middle. It's nowhere near as great as the first one
@SondraWeisberg have you decided what you want to do?
Congratulations to @Phil_Coutinho on being named in the team of the season #LFC #YNWA
Finally booked tickets for #AvengersAgeOfUltron for tonight!!!
@SondraWeisberg are you under pressure trying to think of what video to do?

@SondraWeisberg how you do the make up because you look awesome as her
@SondraWeisberg seeing as you love Harley you could do a harley video tell us why you love her how you make up the costumes
@SondraWeisberg well you could do a serious video bout the mental health issues you wanted to talk about or

@SirenofGotham Sorry is their no hunks in your job <CRYING FACE>
@SirenofGotham I doubt it I say none of the guys you work with can eat their lunch until you are finished ha ha
@SirenofGotham So you don't peel it very slowly and take your time devouring your banana <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@SirenofGotham that is because you are all seductive when you are eating it haha
@SirenofGotham you temptress!! You must be fun at lunch time ha ha
@SirenofGotham Have you tried to seduce a man with a banana??
@SirenofGotham yes eat don't suck ha ha unless you want to get a guys attention then by all means go for it haha
@SirenofGotham It would look like a coat hanger in their mouth <GRINNING FACE> besides it is ok to eat it normally it's only if they start sucking on it!!

@Sherimander I think that is it now England will do it

France are terrible but just scored a try #6nations2015
@Mummsyandzomb the same to you pal
Ireland lead 40-10 against Scotland #IREvSCO #6nations2015
What are you doing Johnny Sexton???? #IREvSCO #6nations2015
Ireland lead 30-10 against Scotland #6nations2015
Poor from Ireland Scotland get a try 17-10 to Ireland #6nations2015
Ireland lead 15-3 #6nations2015
Ireland need to beat Scotland by 21 points It will be a big task but #COMEONIRELAND #6nations2015

@JoshCostella Fantastic movie
A10 Batman of course #mtos

Batman Defeats Superman (The Dark Knight Returns): 
A9 I think he could be very good but I will wait til I see the movie (only a year to go!!!) to make my final judgement #mtos
A8 Robin I ain't a Robin fan so preferably he would be killed by the Joker with a crowbar!! #mtos 
A7 Batman and Robin is awful but it is better than these two horrible horrible movies #mtos 
A6 Another mention would be Cap who is my favourite Marvel hero #mtos 
A6 Favourite Bad Guy who else could it be? #mtos 
A6 Favourite Good Guy is The Bat of course #mtos 
A5 As a DC guy I love it I have wanted to see a DC Universe on screen for a long time if the quality is good they will do well #mtos
A4 It is getting made now I think Suicide Squad is introducing great characters like Harley Quinn Deadshot &amp; Deathstroke #mtos
@thereelfilmshow That whole scene and Bane talking bout the darkness is epic
@thereelfilmshow It is a amazing scene acted brilliantly by both actors
A3 Honourable mention to the Bane v Batman fight from Rises it was straight from the Knightfall comic book #mtos 
A3 Interrogation scene from The Dark Knight #mtos 
A2 I don't mind origin or spin offs IF they are good a lot sadly aren't #mtos
A1 The Dark Knight trilogy is my favourite comic book movies ever. The amount of comic book references in those films are amazing #mtos
@SirenofGotham well you can not blame us can you??
@SirenofGotham damn right ha ha
@Cherri2290 you are welcome

@sandy_mae_ yes but i wasnt first #sadface
@FindShotFirst star trek first contact
@sandy_mae_ no way really???
@sandy_mae_ did she win a golden globe?
@sandy_mae_ yes them polls are a bit screwy when it comes to a certain character
@sandy_mae_ well it is no breaking bad that is for sure ha ha
@sandy_mae_ it won a grace award whatever that is??
I do like #Gotham but for it to win a award for outstanding drama is madness!!

<MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> Do you wanna build a Fortress? <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 
@bookshopgirl212 did you go through a break up? I am so sorry to hear that
@bookshopgirl212 why were you not doing well? I am very happy you are doing better
@bookshopgirl212 I am great my team is winning ha ha How are you doing?
@bookshopgirl212 Gorgeous new profile pic as always
@sandy_mae_ well I don't know how they could use him without mentioning batman
@sandy_mae_ well based on the Batman Inc comic there are 2 one is Bruce's son the other a big goliath that actually kills Bruce's son
@sandy_mae_ pity they don't use them
@sandy_mae_ I heard it could be Damien Wayne
@sandy_mae_ well he wasn't based on batman that is for sure
@sandy_mae_ I liked Chloe but I always knew Clark would end up with Lois
@sandy_mae_ why do fangirls do that?
@sandy_mae_ I could not agree more ha ha
@sandy_mae_ erica durance would have been perfect
@Hermann22 @ModernMythMedia @JohnBierly It is worth watching Paul the trailer is calling you!!
@sandy_mae_ she was muck ha ha
@sandy_mae_ it would have been better not connected to the originals and Lois lane was terrible
@sandy_mae_ it was too much like the original film it should have been it's own movie
@sandy_mae_ I prefer Man of Steel Returns had a lot of problems but none of them were Brandon's fault
@Hermann22 You know you want to watch it!!
@sandy_mae_ either do I it would be so disappointing
@sandy_mae_ no reason ha ha

@Rfourone @amellywoodlove @sandy_mae_ it was good thanks for asking how was yours?

@amellywoodlove @sandy_mae_ oh it is bad and I'm a DC guy saying that
@sandy_mae_ @amellywoodlove good cos you won't get that hour and 20 minutes back ha ha
@sandy_mae_ @amellywoodlove don't watch it it is awful ha ha

@amellywoodlove @sandy_mae_ ha ha don't worry about it
@FindShotFirst Ace ventura when nature calls


What a GAME!! 
@TheOnlyCleoLuna Well I'm sure it will come as a shock to RDJ that he is in Prometheus 2 haha
@TheOnlyCleoLuna My God IMDB is shit
A10 Yes a good HBO or Showtime show none of the network type shows something like True detective #mtos
A9 I hated Prometheus so I would have to say discredit as there is nothing good in that movie #mtos
A8 Just watch Hunger he is fantastic #mtos
A7 I would love to see him as a Irish legend like Finn McCool especially as he has a production company with the same name #mtos
@sandy_mae_ @amellywoodlove the questions for #mtos are all about Mr Fassbender haha
@sandy_mae_ A certain Michael Fassbender @amellywoodlove would love it haha
A6 As a superhero geek has to be X-Men Apocalypse in 2016 #mtos
A5 I love his chemistry with James McAvoy both on and off screen #mtos
A4 Again I would say Hunger #mtos
A3 Yes it was a good performance but he should have been nominated for Hunger #mtos
A2 I was going to say Prometheus but then I remember he was in Jonah Hex so I will say that instead #mtos
A1 I would have to say Hunger I still think its his best performance #mtos
@bookshopgirl212 I'm glad you had a great time!!

@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg @thelegendarykc Yeah a great view of what i wonder haha
@fairytailveg @Sandy_Mae Ah they are just clips you will have a better understanding of why he looks like that when you watch the movie
@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg in that version he is Jack Napier but in the comics there was never a definitive name giving to him
@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg @thelegendarykc haha you are naughty haha that proves it
@fairytailveg @Sandy_Mae Its a great film not as good as The Dark Knight Trilogy I wasn't happy with the end but its a great movie
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ I just send you and sandy another one and as you can see Jack's a lot happier haha
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae

@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @thelegendarykc Haha I'm guessing he won't respond

@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg @thelegendarykc Who could you mean haha
@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg That was the idea but it never happened but i do like Henry Cavill
@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg Returns was too much like a homage to the old films rather then being its own movie
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ He was the best thing in Returns
@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg @thelegendarykc Arrow is struggling I'm hoping Black Canary can turn it around
@sandy_mae_ @fairytailveg I don't blame him haha

A9 I'm going to say Salad dressing making I bet i could make a mean salad dressing #mtos
@fairytailveg A fantastic actress and a true Hollywood Icon
@fairytailveg In the movie she had
@aaron_m_hunter I don't like it it bores me but Cars 2 is a movie I don't even accept exists haha
@fairytailveg Yes her southern accent is fantastic and sexy haha
A8 I would have loved to see him in a Tarantino movie that would have been awesome #mtos
A7 Cars even though its just his voice Cars is Pixar's worse movie EVER!! #mtos
A6 If this is true i can't believe it! He didn't win a Oscar for Cool Hand Luke??#mtos
@fairytailveg And she is drop dead gorgeous in it ;-)
A5 I would say the for myself the 70's as I love The Sting and Towering Inferno but probably the 60's was his best #mtos
A4 I think he excelled in most genres but because of The Sting i would like to have seen him in more comedies #mtos
@fairytailveg Yes so do I he acts his ass off in it
A3 Robert Redford but honourable mention to Steve McQueen in Towering inferno #mtos 
A2 Elizabeth Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof mainly because she is gorgeous in it 
A1 I loved a lot of his movies but I'm gona go for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof mainly because I love his performance in it #mtos

@fairytailveg @Bman923 @sandy_mae_ Yes she is
@Bman923 @fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ Well I agree with that ;-)
@Bman923 @fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ well i didnt i didnt like her at all
@Bman923 @fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ I just thought she was better off dead it added guilt to oliver's character
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 Thank you again haha I go red from too many compliments haha
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 I thought her being dead cos of oliver as a interesting storyline but bringing her back was pointless
@Bman923 @fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ No it was dragging her through the muck when she was such a strong character in season 1
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 Why thank you I like to over support where i can
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 Well i didnt like sara as black canary im glad the real one taking over now
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 Yes I told sandy it looks good on me haha and you are most welcome its no bother its a very cool symbol
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 Well she getting her time to shine she is the lead female character &amp; is from the comics she deserves it
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 well the journey to becoming a hero or villain are sometimes the best stories
@Bman923 @fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ well season 2 storylines where terrible for her
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 plenty of time to perfect her fighting skills and get her cry
@fairytailveg @sandy_mae_ @Bman923 Well this is season 3 when you look at smallville and supernatural that hit 10 seasons she will have
@fairytailveg @Bman923 @sandy_mae_ Well i for one am glad I think the writers have not given her the stories she deserved until now
@fairytailveg @Bman923 @sandy_mae_ origin from the comics
@fairytailveg @Bman923 @sandy_mae_ I like black canary I have wondered how laurel will become black canary as I did not know much bout her
@sandy_mae_ @Bman923 @fairytailveg She won't be the finished article yet but ether was oliver when he started
