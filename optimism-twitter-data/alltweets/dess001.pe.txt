I have the best boyfriend ever! Although he's imaginary
If i could go back a few weeks ago and redo it then i would with no hesitation
I dont even know how you got my number because i sure wouldn't give it to you!
I think i need to change my number because people wont quit texting me repeatidly! Leave me alone if i wanted to talk to you then i would
I need to start tanning or something. I feel like a dang ghost!
I remember when i used to be really shy &amp; wouldn't talk to anyone! Now, i never shut up
I'm just gonna start being straight forward for now on #dontcare
I love lifetime movies
If i wanted to take you to prom then i would have already asked you.. so quit bugging me!
Its impossible for me to watch a scary movie by myself !
Don't date someone just to make somebody else jealous
Everybody always dies their hair the same way
Sometimes im shy.. and i wish i wasn't
A jealous girl does more research than the FBI
#ThoughtsInTheHallway move your making me late! Walk on your side of the hall. If you step on the back of my shoe one more time your dead.

Those songs that describe exactly how you feel &gt;&gt;
I try so hard trying to making other people happy that i forget to make myself happy too
It would be nice to have someone to talk to that i can trust

That feeling you get when you realize no one cares..
Crying yourself to sleep&lt;&lt;&lt;

Roses are red, violets are blue, if i had a brick I'd throw it at you!
If you think i want you back then you must be smoking crack
@Ryyyderr lmfao ! Were weird
@Ryyyderr lol &amp; instead of saying dicks i just say sporting goods ans my mom knows what i mean lolol
#wheniwaslittle i was scared to say the pussycat dolls around my parents.. lmao
Guess what? No one cares
It was nice being away for the weekend. I didn't have internet or cell phone service &amp; i didn't care one bit. That meant no drama or worries
I wish i was good at making new friends
We aren't dating, but when i see someone flirting with you i just wanna punch them in the face
