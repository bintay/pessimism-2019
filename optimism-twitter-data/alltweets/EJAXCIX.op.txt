Decided to put a labour poster in the food processor with the top off and now there's thousands of pieces of ed Miliband all over my kitchen
@Affrocentric @allyhxward @lampkinberry @_MegRead  "When David Cameron won't debate you, let him fight you."

@Affrocentric @allyhxward @lampkinberry @_MegRead @PoliticalReactz "When Ed Miliband meets an angry voter."

overwhelmed with joy 
@allyhxward @Affrocentric @lampkinberry  
@allyhxward @Affrocentric @_MegRead @lampkinberry <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> but then again if milifandom is a thing not too bad??!!
@allyhxward @Affrocentric @_MegRead @lampkinberry <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> that thing actually looks more like me than ed Miliband does
@will_johnson99 girls in Pakistan aren't allowed to ride bikes but they are allowed to ride skateboards
What an amazing picture 
@Callum__Grieve way too far
@jedjohnson13 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Never know whether to be ballsy and maybe come off too confident or be reserved
I'm not just defending my mate but why would you cheat on Jed Johnson :/
David Cameron the savage
Ed Miliband is now apparently a sex symbol, yayyy
Surely Kylie Jenner should be focusing on her A Levels now???
Is this desireeeeeeeeeeeee
@louisevans__ hahahahahah oh yeah
@Callum__Grieve <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Think I've got ten exams in five days and one those days is my birthday how splendid
@Braid_griffiths the answer to everything in life is rave
Happy rave sad rave tired rave stressed rave anxious rave upset rave revision rave death rave love rave insanity rave school rave bus rave
@Callum__Grieve @Braid_griffiths that's your two responses right there
@Braid_griffiths that's actually cute
Just watched Emmerdale for two seconds by accident and I have just witnessed the greatest roasting of all time
Give it the big listen: 
I perform 90% better in exams if I listen to Kanye before
Chris banter is unbelievable
@Braid_griffiths @WillGroves1998 I hope you get home safely
Cba to keep revising I'm changing my surname
@WillGroves1998 @Braid_griffiths hope you're having a whale of a time
@WillGroves1998 you tell me 4/20
@WillGroves1998 yeah I see those scribbles
@WillGroves1998 <NEUTRAL FACE>
@WillGroves1998  
@ukipgloucester Thank you
I have to be careful otherwise people will actually think I support UKIP
Aw no shit my really observant anti UKIP cleaner will definitely spot it <PENSIVE FACE>
HE JUST LOOKED AT THE PICTURE AND DIDNT NOTICE
How many days before my dad notices? 
@ShaunK98 oh Roger
@ShaunK98 same, he has just come back and said he thinks it's funny but people will take it too seriously :((
Are we the same  
@Henrygmalcolm stop Henry
@ukipgloucester will Mr Farage be out campaigning in Gloucester and if so when?
4:20 is a time not a date you imbeciles
If Ed Miliband pledged to deport Katie Hopkins he would win hands down
Chris doesn't approve of my UKIP antics
Bet Chris has thrown away my UKIP poster the little socialist
Where's my UKIP poster????
Wrote 4/20 blaze it in my geography book as a joke and forgot to cross it out but oh well
How the week should be 
Dad goes out to approximately two parties a weekend which is approximately two more than what I do
Oh my sweet Jesus it's Joseph Barrett  
Trying to get through these exams like 
Monday tomorrow 
@WillGroves1998  
Take that always take me higher
@SaskiaBarnett ahh thank you x
Never forget where you're coming from
Slowly this house is feeling like my home :))
Yes I like piña coladas 
Keep accidentally following and unfollowing people Jesus
The incredibles is incredible
@Mikeynorwood @FIirtyynotez everything will be alright in the end, and if it's not alright, it's not the end
@FIirtyynotez @Mikeynorwood mike
I get roasted on Twitter without even knowing
@purpleoli99 oh
Mr incredible definitely skips leg day
@purpleoli99      Cassetteboy vs Nick Griffin vs Question Time 
The Formula 1 start up montage and music gets me so excited
@traeblair_ used by angry chavs
Think Farida just made a sensational pun
Ed Miliband threw his phone at someone who worked for him wow that's sensational
Spent my morning watching people throwing Eggs at Ed Miliband he looks so helpless <PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
@Nigel_Farage How many retweets will it take for you to come to our prom???

So jealous of Kai in Monaco <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

@traeblair_ <SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
@traeblair_ it's over now trae bae

Well yes because it affects my everyday life unlike height and the body count of a random…
Nigel Farage just walked off?!
Ed Miliband has called you out Dave
Why are they vilifying the Tories so so much? Like the villain in a movie
SNP and Labour I'm more than happy with that
So if he dumped you?? 
I'm voting for Leanne did you just hear that joke!!!!!
@Affrocentric wrong
There is this worry of a superstate
@Affrocentric ed agrees with me
'Savage cuts' not as savage as you Nicola
Sorry guys I'm all for trident
'Farage fights for freedom' new headline
NICOLA
Nicola sturgeon speaks and she gets a clap
Nigel stop it please I want you to do well please calm down
@arronj_smith @glitterbuug they know where the unfollow button is
Farage basically just said immigrants shouldn't have houses
If you have worked for your money why should you be taxed 60% on it just because you've succeeded
Ed Miliband is just stood there like 'I'm the only one that has a chance of running this country here so why am I here'
Want Cameron to just walk in and par everyone
When someone's chatting shit and you're waiting to roast them with facts 
@Henrygmalcolm his Scotland comment?
FARAGE YOU SAVAGE

"My buttocks are smooth, my mind is clear - vote Ukip."
Guys Will Groves put a picture of his knives on Instagram, not really sure I wanna fuck with this kid anymore
I'm so excited I can't speak 
If Hilary doesn't win presidency I will cry
@WillGroves1998 @purpleoli99 @UKIP @Nigel_Farage absolutely
@WillGroves1998 @purpleoli99 @UKIP @Nigel_Farage but watching it together will be so much fun <BROKEN HEART><BROKEN HEART><BROKEN HEART>
@WillGroves1998 @purpleoli99 @UKIP @Nigel_Farage it's not even far cousin
Come to mine and watch the debate, bring T will be joke af @WillGroves1998 @purpleoli99  
@thei100 @Independent it's 'e' right?
Just want to be Spencer Matthews please
@Braid_griffiths that sounds like a fair shout although I might fly to Dubai and then walk into the desert until I slowly die
@Braid_griffiths ok bud I'll book flight
If Ed Miliband becomes PM do I kill myself or leave the country and then kill myself
@maddison_hg <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@maddison_hg looking like Ed Miliband is not a good thing?<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@maddison_hg I wouldn't go as far as uncanny???

@harvpoll happy birthday mate!!
Is art revision therapeutic or not??
@WillGroves1998 fab
How anybody could sit and watch a girl be assaulted, let alone do it, is beyond me
Why would you lie in an Instagram comment? It looks mean from a third person perspective
My dogs actually an attention seeker, she eats stones until I throw her stick smh
I did just walk downstairs topless eating some pain au chocolat to encounter my cleaner didn't I
@kirstinbknl just seen this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> thank you x
@jedjohnson13 that's actually sick
@jedjohnson13 oo nice where?
@jedjohnson13 have you actually been to South America??
@jedjohnson13 China??? Antarctica??? South America???

Smoking puts you at risk of looking like Nigel Farage. 
I just jogged 1KM!!

@GavStaceyReacts @WillGroves1998
Nobody will ever understand my love for Jeremy Clarkson
@Henrygmalcolm oh yeah I would have thrown a chair at her and made her feel small and puny and inferior in society
@Henrygmalcolm who does she think she is saying 'I was happy when Clarkson was sacked' should have two footed her to be honest
When Katie said Top Gear was crap this morning I don't think me calling her an uneducated commoner was strong enough
I'm sunbathing this is fab weather
The week has only just begun and I want it to end
@Mikeynorwood @spaniswhite he rejected you
@Mikeynorwood @spaniswhite @eangove no but she would swipe left
@Mikeynorwood @spaniswhite @eangove why don't you just go and get catfished by a 40 year old man you whore
@Mikeynorwood @spaniswhite @eangove you have a tinder account
@Mikeynorwood @spaniswhite @eangove can convo come to an end now

I don't even know what my dad has had done  to the Jag but it's so much faster what
@Affrocentric @WillGroves1998 they are third in the polls at the moment, very interesting
A man stood next to David Cameron singing fuck off back to Eton HAHAHA
Ed Miliband's self confidence has grown so much bless him, he now looks so confident it's great
CON - 33% (-3)
LAB - 33% (-1)
UKIP - 13% (+3)
LDEM - 9% (+3)
GRN - 6% (-1)
Ask me if I've forgotten my English homework

Quidditch World Cup REALLY fucking really
Mid revision rave
Do homework as revision??? Win win win
@Mikeynorwood yeah?? Well I'm not a fan to be honest I just sort of guess what's happening and try and have an opinion
@Mikeynorwood just to confirm I'm not a shitty glory fan
@Mikeynorwood how fantastic, Chris is a united fan so I guess I'll follow suit (he is from Manchester)
@Mikeynorwood what is it?
For god sake I found it
Tried to get my dog to eat An Inspector Calls and I've lost it
@J_albzy @fIirting definitely
@J_albzy @fIirting yeah clearly the person who wrote it has never heard of banter
@J_albzy @fIirting that's such twitter crap
Done literally no revision wtf I'm going to fail seriously I have such high aims but I can't revise I just can't do it

My dad is basically my best mate
One thing I can say is my life is never ever boring, something new and unexpected happens every single day

If Ed Miliband wins the election with a majority then the country will be run by two Eds and that's a great prospect

@spaniswhite she came out very well in polls
@spaniswhite yep
@spaniswhite Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon would be better
@spaniswhite I think that would have to be UKIP and conservatives though
@spaniswhite precisely, Farage makes it 100x more interesting
@spaniswhite really UKIP shouldn't be there, they have two MP's it's just because they've had so much media attention recently
@spaniswhite the Green Party and SNP have more MPs than UKIP so they're technically bigger

@ShaunK98 @Mikeynorwood Farage is savage
@Mikeynorwood @ShaunK98 no excuse
@Mikeynorwood @ShaunK98 just because you didn't watch it don't try and be nice
I just don't think Cameron comes across as though he cares enough
@ShaunK98 I think Ed Miliband did surprisingly well
@Ed_Miliband well done bro
@ShaunK98 why Tory Shaun?
Farage makes people laugh that's his talent
@ShaunK98 he is doing very well in polls
@ShaunK98 and he drives an immigrant (Volvo)
@Ed_Miliband gunna be honest he said quite a few things
Ed running over to shake Cameron's hand that is so cute
Farage is there for the banter really
Farage makes me feel so great about being British I can not lie to you
Please please can one of them say 'you've heard from 7 of us tonight, but I'm the one you need'

I feel like making some really fantastic snapchat stories
Swear she didn't fall over it looks like she was pulled over??
To be fair we actually have quite a lot of talent in this country
