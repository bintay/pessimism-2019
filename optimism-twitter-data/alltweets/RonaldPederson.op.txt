I've been improvising new Maya Angelou poems for the last 30 hours at the @dienastyimprov 22nd annual 50 hour Soap-A-Thon.
Now @U2 is outside my window. Bono is sadly holding a boom-box over his head blaring music. I think it's a new U2 song. It's just terrible.
Now @U2 is calling my cell and leaving terrible new songs on my voice mail.
43 more @U2 albums have mysteriously appeared in my @iTunesMusic. I think it's an infestation.
And now to Edmonton to appear with the worlds greatest improvisers in the @dienastyimprov 50 hour Soap-a-Thon. Insane, profound, holy, long!
