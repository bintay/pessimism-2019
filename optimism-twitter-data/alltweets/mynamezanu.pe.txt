Running on 4 hours of sleep and can't deal with my mom's stupid questions like "So were the Harrison twins really tall? :)"
My brother just searched "5 dollar scooter" on eBay and called the man and asked if he could go any lower on the price
Future so bright he gotta wear shades (glasses) (while he sleeps) 
2 years ago I cried because I had to leave her and today I cried tears of joy because we're back on 4EVA! I love you, @TayllorrBlairr
My prayers have finally been answered!!!!!!
