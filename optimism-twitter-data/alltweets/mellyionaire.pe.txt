@daddylongdreads <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> he was like what do you mean not MVP 
Same people burning the flag are the same people living off the government.
Seeing those incomplete passes are scary! You can see who came to the game with a bunch of surprise plays
@daddylongdreads hate is a strong word
I'm not even gonna celebrate that.
@daddylongdreads okay. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> like all the tackles and sacks in the world won't mean shit if your offense isn't on the same page
Games like this drive me completely crazy! When your defense has to pull all that offensive dead weight &lt;&lt;&lt;
Note to Self: your shoes are under the couch... They're not lost
@daddylongdreads damn! I feel like I'm about to be right there with you after this game
When Cowboy fans talk shit about the Cowboys it's okay. When haters talk shit it's not okay <FISTED HAND SIGN>
@daddylongdreads shhh!!!!!
Damn I wish I was TMobile right now #DataStash
Tackle football.... Hmmmm
@MattyGee88 open a tab and schedule a DD! Alcohol might be your only relief

@Lunaa_Tikk if someone else posted what I did I would've said the same thing you did.
@Lunaa_Tikk whatcha gonna do with all that money? Might as well share and spend it. Life is temporary
@Lunaa_Tikk it's the modesty that keeps me from walking around like a know it all. I couldn't try and correct someone I didn't know
@Lunaa_Tikk Haha I'd definitely share my money secret.
Resumes are so frustrating
@Lunaa_Tikk calm down <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@Lunaa_Tikk you have a better conscience than me lol
@Lunaa_Tikk I don't get paid for that
@Lunaa_Tikk NOPE! They need to use that "smart phone" and educate themselves
