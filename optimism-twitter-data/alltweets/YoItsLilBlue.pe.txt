Procrastination, the one thing  I've always been good at.
People who honk when there's traffic like that's going to do shit to speed things up.
I wish I could have powers like the X-Men.
@AngelinaGaalvis Good luck!!
That awkward moment when you're in the restroom and a little kid looks under the door...

@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow Ight then, good to know! :) Well at least others can see this so they know that we aren't
@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow EXCEPT we are not..
@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow Animals mainly don't depend on gardens. They have their own food source outside the garden.
@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow Well, bunnies depend and live off food outside. So we aren't killing anything.
@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow Ight, so you get my point?
@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow They ONLY eat the lettuce IF a garden is around. They mainly live off food outside the garden.
@kaymillerr @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow Except for the fact that they eat grasses, weeds (like dandelions), Shrubs, and grass.
@kaymillerr  @twittalessmikey @ImLeslieChow 
Wrong.We vegetarians really only eat food grown from gardens.Which doesn't effect animals!!
@ImLeslieChow Fact: Non-vegetarians eat plants too! Can't just blame "us" vegetarians.

@kwandrews Well it's annoying like I know what I'd do.Run out the front door. Make a movie where they instead chase the person out the door.
