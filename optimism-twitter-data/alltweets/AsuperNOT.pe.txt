“@angelchangsta: Went to eat my hot Cheetos to find that @AsuperNOT ate half the bag <UNAMUSED FACE>” I hope you didn't eat them all:/
Bro that guys name is Phil... That's my dads name... They are long lost family 
Since this is a closer representation of how you pronounce my last name, I've decided to just change it 
@sinceuquinngone literally so annoying... They act like they are the only ones doing anything. <UNAMUSED FACE>
When this happens, no matter the situation. Everything else becomes so insignificant
There are so many people I want to meet this year<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

I love sending people I don't talk to that much, random sweet texts just so they know they're perfect and I still love them<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
If I ever went to prison/ solitary confinement, all the time I couldn't sleep I would just work out the whole time
“@CAmackenzie: Oomf..<WEARY FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>” @ me next time
I wish my phone was working that'd be real nice

@_CoryHart I need that rice in my mouth rn
@aaliyahsumm can you send me money over sc?

@chickfilKAY you're the real mvp<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
The fact that I'm watching my favorite movie makes today a little better <BLUE HEART>
"You don't even make an effort" you're right because I used to, and you didn't care, so yeah I stopped trying for you
I don't feel like it
Especially oranges music, don't even change oranges music if it's playing unless you want me to cut your arms off
Cheer music gets on my nerves for real. But sometimes I'm just in the mood for it
Don't tell me to get over it or that I'm over reacting because you have no idea what I'm going through.
On purpose? Why?
The people that make New Years this huge deal, annoy me so much!! stop posting "deep" tweets about it you know you're not going to change?
@BrandonMoring it's good though it's not sappy :/
@BrandonMoring stuck in love, sucks at first but it gets better
@MalekHinton_ can you tell me the exact building and can you put it all in one bag and throw it straight to me?
“@MalekHinton_: New Years I'm going to take a $1,000 and throw it off a roof on New Years <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>.” Where? I'll be sure to be there
“@angelchangsta: Shout out to @d_budd7 for reading @AsuperNOT's tweet out loud for her to realize how dumb they sound” still don't care
You think your tweets are fine until someone reads them all back to you with a sassy voice... Then you start to feel real dumb
I hate when people say "hey;)" it makes me feel uncomfortable
