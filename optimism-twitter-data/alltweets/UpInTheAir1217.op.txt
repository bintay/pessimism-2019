@jenxstagram of course nothing ever made more sense, holla at those boys
@jenxstagram you are beautiful. In every single way. Something something something somethinggggggggg
Huge, and I mean, huge finals going on Wednesday. This could make or break my entire semester <TIRED FACE>
I'm just too lazy to go to the shop I think. Like they're so far. But funny. Do I really need more? No. But the needle is addicting.
So I'm taking a quiz, answered literally one question, and got distracted with my tattoo, and debating what I really want <TIRED FACE> lol
@ashley_pesch I miss that woman <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ lol
Apparently it's worse than drugs because it's all chemical. Interesting.
"Spend enough time together, bond and they could be the most lethal person to you. Worse than drugs." Oh okay. Lol I couldn't help but laugh
The majority of my class was talking about love and how imprinting is a thing with humans. Like u once u find ur human ur screwed.
@Jeff_Maggiore halted ish?!? Idk I got off the grand stop from the blue line and walked east <TIRED FACE> I was lost.
In summary: 
Juliet died for Romeo when she thought he was dead, and that's always been perceived as love right.. Sigh.
I remember New Years and how 2015 was supposed to be amazing. Like all good things I look forward to, that thought is dead.
"You look like you just lost a limb" 
Most accurate thing anyone's ever said to me in my life. Because they're close.
Which reminds me that I've never been kissed in the pouring rain and that I'll never have a picnic date and that life sucks and I want out.
I was only about two miles away. Nbd. And it was raining. Cool. Awesome day. Bloody ankles. Perf. 
Less than 4hrs of sleep. Ask me if I'm tired? Not at all. There are bigger problems than sleep deprivation in my book.
"Así que escúchame, Porque el silencio es un infierno, Sácame y si tu amor es un incendio, apágame" <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
<DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE> nope nope nope
If I have to be awake in like 4 hours what's the point in even sleeping? Did I really want a chance at an internship anyway? Hm.
I don't think I'm strong enough for this.

Talk about humble braggers
Consumer profile for tomorrow's presentation. My group thought I was joking when I said I'd make an FB page. #skills 
And see nothing but beautiful men. They've lowered my self esteem.
So for my ad class, we have to give a face to our consumer. This entire campaign is for gay males. I go on Pinterest and search gay fashion:
Give me something to believe innnn
<SQUARED SOS>
Life without anxiety would be great ;(

I'm just really happy with the coral..... It's supposed to be kinda surreal so. Yeah. Yay coral. 
Yellow stars all around for Drea
It is what it is. You can't change what's already happened, only hope that more doesn't follow.
You put a little bit of faith in someone it's like they need to instantly show you 100k reasons why you never should have even considered it
Alrighty in all seriousness, I need to look at everything as the glass being half full even though the glass has shattered.. lol sigh.
So I achieved my flat tummy goal in the unhealthiest way possible lol let me start up a gym membership to tone it up a bit..
My name is jahaira rodriguez, I am a hopeless romantic, a dreamer and irrationally optimistic about love. I'll build a happy ending dammit.
All my friends have gone to find another place to let their hearts collide ~
Welp. I at least have the memories to hang on to. Blessing or curse? Hm.
I'm supposed to speed to my death rn and the traffic isn't letting me go past 30mph.
Kick start to a panic attack?! I think so! Let's hope it's while I speed to work.
Quietest day of my life. To top things off, I shouldn't have had tea on an empty stomach bc now my heart is racing.
Literally me every morning except with my pillow. Lol what is life. 
&amp;&amp; triple yup 
Yupp 
Yup 
I'll sit outside my building pretending I'm waiting for someone since everyone walking around me suddenly has someone, ok.
Quedate x Camila, holy guac

Leave the hopeless romantics alone Mario!!! Lol
@KiDDerekk bless you Derek
Drowning and I can't swim. What a life.

@jenxstagram 5!
#collegein5words was that really due today?
@jenluning get here ASAP 
Why must I work and never be involved in school stuff -.-  
@gracehelbig @chestersee @jenluning
I think gingers get shot up with a double dose of emotions to make up for the fact that we don't have a soul.
Tequilaaa 
@lMaR5l but I can buy Advil at Walmart... Oh wait. Ha.
@lMaR5l I was thinking something more along the lines of Advil
At least there are drugs for physical pain
Had to force myself awake due to the extreme inaccuracy of my dream. I really can't enjoy anything lately.
This episode of Married at First Sight, holy guac, pobrecita, I get her so well.
My tolerance for stupidity is exclusive, gtfo.
It means I wanted it so I fucking got it
Attempts count too  
Consumed by my restless thoughts, no wonder people sleep so much.
It's like I'm mourning a death, holy shit
Tell me that you've turned down the man, who asked for your hand, cause you're waiting for me<TWO HEARTS>
When songs hold so many memories lol omg good times <CONFUSED FACE>
okay, haven't heard that song since middle school yet all the lyrics just hit me like a truck   
Not going to cry, not going to cry...<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ lol the world needs more relationships like this!!!   
Kinda want Cheetos. Kinda don't want the weight. No Cheetos. Sleep.

Honestly, some people don't know what they have.

That's how you know you watch too much YouTube...... I'd like to think in a good way bc they're cool lol
I feel like I haven't seen @Jenna_Marbles and Julien as if they were my real life BFFs.
@jenluning yup
@jenluning thoughts exactly
Isn't it awesome forgetting deadlines to things because of all the other bs going on in your life? There goes my grade.
All this free time and nothing to do. And by nothing to do I mean, nothing I actually need to do like you know, final projects.
I feel like breathing normally isn't even possible anymore. It's like my anxiety is on 24/7 now and my desire to eat shut off.
Fish face over duck face any day. 
Just taking an unproductive walk <HORSE FACE> 
Praying for an internship if the ad agency likes my groups pitch. My teacher really loved the ads I made <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
When will that click though lol  
This evolution of the mind class taught me how toxic our minds can be because they're constantly running. Consciously and unconsciously <TIRED FACE>
Suits and sleeves. I repeat, suits and sleeves.
Slowly but surely.
@noemi13_xo you're going to sweat your ass off
@Lizjizzzz you're each others number one!
He sounds like a jerk. TELL ME SOMETHING I DONT KNOW lol
Nothing but Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith playing in class and the guy in my group is like, wow hope nobody just went through a breakup lmao
Desperately want the wrist one but that's impossible when you're Hispanic 
True that 
Liked my outfit yesterday. I had to document it since I didn't go out in it. Whoops. 
That's probably the worst thing a human can do. Why are there such terrible people in this world. Can't they just be kicked to hell.?
You know when you know your worth somewhere deep down but someone strips that from you and it's suddenly unrecognizable?
I wouldn't be left lonely if I played the same game.
This speaks to me on so many levels  
@BeatzByDrea yup

iPhone six or wait or thigh piece or wrist tattoo. UGH.
Fershur 
@ScrewDriving SOMEONE has to have the right answer. But that's true. Maybe u can read probability's mind
@ScrewDriving you could just read minds and read the right answers to stuff from the already smart people, duh. But that's just me.
My back pain is getting worse and worse as the night continues and I feel like I have terrible cramps, I'm officially dying.
I want to go see the avengers movie tonight but I don't want to go alone <PENSIVE FACE>
Dear uterus and lower back. Your pain visit is too early. Please stop and return at your scheduled time. Thank you.
@zekeblue3 <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND>
My heart feels like it sinks down to my stomach out of nowhere. Why. Please stop it organs. Get your shit together.
Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around <SUN BEHIND CLOUD>️
What else is new 
@jenluning I heard one and a half songs live. Yay. They're good.
Surrealism drawing? Idk. Let's live in sharks. 
Sure enough, as soon as I start listening to my own music, anxiety. I have a sickening taste of music. And a bad sarcastic pun mind.
@jenluning as in like nah, idk, I'm going to end up going for some more ink to piss my parents off a bit -.- lol
@jenluning lol no no no
@RodriguezArt01 terrible music lol I had a dub step playlist going from spotify then I started listening to podcasts!
Been here since 8:30am and only did 9 little sketches lol help.
All I did today was my sketches, none of my final projects because life sucks
Seriously wish I never lost anything that way I'd still have some kind of motivation, but nope. All gone. Blink.
And I say that since I'm ignored and it's the only thing that makes sense to me right now and I'm mad/depressed so. Suck it.
Obviously there's someone else that's going to look a whole lot prettier and get to have fun. Because it's not like I exist anymore -.-
I was so excited to finally dress up and look pretty and now I'm considering just going to work bc if I stay home lol bad things happen
You can literally just show up or call and I'd all for it. Like what, you want to stop making life miserable, okay!
I just want talk to someone about everything without feeling like annoying crap or judged <DISAPPOINTED FACE> #alone and stupid, yep:/
Everything hurtsssssss
This couldn't have happened at a better time. I don't think I can even finish the semester anymore, I just want to stay homeeeeee #owmyheart
I think someone meant to say "I'm lying" but what do I know.
Some people see their problems as a curse when people like me see their problems as a damn gift <CONFUSED FACE>
All great work comes under pressure.
My dad asked me, do you have a lot of work to do? And I responded, yes. Final projects for every class but I haven't started any. So.
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Some day I'll be taken out and loved and appreciated and cared about and who knows, maybe even thought of. #whydoikeepdreamin t
@jenluning lmfao
presentation with a fashion major tomorrow guys. looks like i actually have to try to look good tomorrow standing next to her.

@marlenaa96 congrats Marlena!!!! I hope you love it and have a blast in color guard next year!!! :)
Once again, I should be sleeping. But I'm up.
So much pressure from people that shouldn't even matter! Society sucks
I literally wanted to cry when I saw Bruce say he's a woman bc it's sad for someone to live a lie so long! :( #BruceJennerABC
Like I can afford my thigh piece now, no prob. I CANT AFFORD MAKING TIME FOR IT. I just want it before going to mexicooo.
So maybe it's in the bank because I have no time to spend it..
It feels good to have some money in the bank. It doesn't feel good that it's because you have no days off.
This is depressing
Team #HopelessRomantic because I stay waiting for them to come true.
I have the most unrealistically perfect dreams sometimes. Why
Hungry and exhausted. Tomorrow is going to be a drag ;(
@OnneLove30 YES, like please skin still be there <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT> lmao
@OnneLove30 <HAPPY PERSON RAISING ONE HAND> I do and I'm always afraid to look down afterwards <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>
Freezing my ass off. I wanna cuddle.
Buzzfeed and YouTube til I knock out <THUMBS UP SIGN>🏻
I could've learned so much instead of figuring it out on my own in college, cmon mannnnn. Oh well. It was relaxing.
All that coloring potential and I had without a damn drawing class in high school, I WANT A REFUND.
100xs yes 
I think I procrastinate decent... #drawing #icantcolorspoons #fartrhymeswithart 
I have some scary ass thoughts, like where did yall come from..... Oh yeah.
I want to watch a movie but I haven't slept in like a week so I guess I'll just watch a movie in my dreams if my imagination doesn't fail me
Please tell me I still have my receipts somewhere
Still no energy drink <WEARY FACE> I'll wait til I feel really sleepy.
I literally look at engaged people like unicorns lol, tell me your love story.
TKO
I miss this class and teacher. Realist dude ever. 
I rather be designing a book or magazine than half ass reading.
I should probably delete all the pictures from my phone.
Good 
I literally feel like I'm trapped in an huge empty room and I'm not allowed to scream for help no matter how much I need it. Awful much.
NO. Because I'm too busy being mind fucked to get anything that actually matters done.
I have a huge presentation to do and an entire colored drawing I haven't even started for tomorrow. ASK ME IF IVE STARTED ANY?!
I miss feeling happy with the way things areeeeeeeeee (or were?) life blowsssssss don't grow up kids.
Like yep, he's going home to someone, yep, she's going home to someone, yep.
I look at left hands a lot on public transportation.
Stupid hungry but all I crave is a cookie or donut sooooooo I'm just not eating today.
I just need someone to talk to. Why can't you text a shrink yet.
I think I've officially reached the point where keeping everything in is doing its damage <WATER WAVE>
@jenluning SHE DOESNT SING THAT PART
"You look so wonderful in your dress, I love your hair like that" I get compliments via music, thanks Ed
I'm getting a little tired of your broken promisthesth promisthesth, lookin at ur pagesth stheeing different numbersth
A couple more hours of sleep maybe? Maybe not.
I love love. It's stupid, but I love seeing it in other people. #suckerforproposalvids
I think the reason I've stopped reading is bc I usually end up jealous of the relationship the characters have lol. False hope.
@SimentalLucia my mom is more cool about stuff. My dad on the other hand. Oh no.
"As long as you live under my roof you will follow my rules" *looking for a new roof* <FACE WITH OK GESTURE>🏻
"Moving out is a waste of money" UH having my own space without being treated like I'm 12 does not sound like a waste to me.
I hate caring so much sometimes, makes ya weak. &amp; ain't nobody got timeeeee for weakness.
I feel like <PILE OF POO>
I know trains. Not busses. Dare I walk it....? Lol
I love when neither of my parents answer their phones. I should've just been late to class if no one could pick me up -.-
Can't listen to Aventura without immediately thinking about @Rachelelohel
I have no patience, tis one of those dayysssssssssss <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I'm so crabby. It's insane.
Well I've thick skin and an elastic heart, but your blade, it might be too sharp, I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard.
Walking behind people wouldn't be gross if you know it weren't windy and the people in front weren't smelly RMU lacrosse dudes. <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
I feel like Madonna is having a Miley moment.
Thanks Nike YouTube ads. Now I want to shop and workout. You got me. @nikewomen
Why is Van Buren and Wabash so smelly...
Geez, there's no reason to wonder why when you can't even practice what you preach. #ridonkulous
Hypocritessssssss
@UpInTheAir1217 jk guys it's not bs, I really got into this paper.
Jk Lissitzky was a pretty cool dude.
Because you can't just WRITE a research paper in art school... I hope the design takes away from the bs.. lol 
@jenluning <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@jenluning but I want a bracelet still
@jenluning no it's not
Had to write a 3 page paper. I picked El Lissitzky to write about. Now I'm thinking this can easily go to 10 pages. Oh no.
Starving but have two papers to write and feeling like absolute crap. I don't see the time to eat today. College will be the death of me.
Reasons why I spend most of my time on YouTube. 
Some people are so inconsiderate it makes me question everything. Fucked up priorities lately. I swear.
#SoYouThinkYouCanDraw 
Foggy city 
They better not think I'm going to do the work of 3. Nope. That's not fair.
When you're supposed to work with two other people but they call off. Great. Lonely in the dark. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
A couple of weeks ago, life was pretty perf. I don't like how people change. Boo.
Work at 7am. When do I get to do homework...? Oh right. I don't.
Officially going into my sad girl days in 3, 2........<COLLISION SYMBOL>
I'm the only dumb ass that can clearly see the situation is against me and still remain persistent. Why oh why me.

Can I have her life yet. 
Love the way the L smells. #shitnobodysays #chicagoproblems
There's a ten degree difference between my house and school. The city is ten degrees colder. Ugh.
Is being "too sad to function" a thing? Bc that's me today.
“@ComedyOrTruth: if u insult me i will probably agree”

Didn't think I'd do that again. Something's just have to be handled a certain way I guess .-.
I need to find my own special thing to do other than working.
I guess I shouldn't put my hopes up in the first place. Boo.
Lol well it looks like everyone just keeps doing this, mention something but actually exclude Jahaira out of everything crap. Rude <UNAMUSED FACE>

It bugs me when I'm questioned about having two jobs. Like are you going to buy me everything I want? Pay my loans? I want a new car.

Ha. Brain class. It makes it sound easier. But it's not.

Happy that there's nothing but good intentions behind it. But I'm still human!!!
Sometimes I feel like I'm prohibited from feeling. Everyone is just different. Everything feels different to everyone.

One time I was mad at my bf but then he in all seriousness saw and called an opossum an armadillo... I lost my mad face. Haha
Our first dates revolved around sitting watching movies at the smelly Cinemark. Since then we've continued to sit and watch movies. At York.
Yesterday at an art gallery the dude was like oh was that one of those first date things. Sam and I were just like no. That was forever ago.
Just your average poster at school, ya know. 
And I should probably delete that bc he'll hate me for sharing that with the world. So. My last two tweets were lies. Carry on.
He didn't even remember haha
Today I put mascara on my bf before he left to be with his brothers. I don't think they'd even notice bc his lashes were long to begin with.
Person doing construction at my house. Parents aren't home yet. I'll find something to do for another 45 mins before going home...
I'll probably get that before the ring I want.

I'll never get tired of that song
Swear to shake it up if you swear to listen, oh we're still so young, desperate for attention I aim to be your eyes trophy boys trophy wives

One day I hope someone likes me enough to take me seriously.
“@DrunkyStory: THIS IS WHY I LOVE/HATE TWITTER <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #alexfromtarget 
Black Widow x Iggy Azalea puts me in a bitchy mood <FISTED HAND SIGN>
When I listen to bachata, I think of @Rachelelohel and listening to music together on the bus and practice <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
"Yo que te falle a ti mil veces sigo siendo tu dueño" <WEARY FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
I say that now, but as soon as I walk into a girls bathroom I reevaluate my life.
If my make up is done, I really don't care how my hair looks.
If it's not happening now, what makes you think it will happen later? Constant debate between feelings and facts.
*shouldn't
I should have to sit around miserable when everyone else is able to do whatever the hell they feel like it right??
Shits not adding up and I'm stupid enough to still wait around. What the fuck is wrong with me.
"You've given your heart to someone, you love them with every bone in your body, but yet, you have to beg for their attention."
I shouldn't be wanting food right now. Or at all.
I had a brain fart. I saw someone post a happy birthday thing and I was thinking, that's annoying their birthday was... Last year.. Oh.
Reasons why @BeatzByDrea is bae.
@BeatzByDrea I meant people, as in people say they're not. Haha I'm eh. But thanks :]
@BeatzByDrea ur the most fun to poke ideas out of. Ppl say I'm not creative and then spit out aan idea and I'm like tf that come from...lol
@BeatzByDrea oh no it gets worse. One time I lost the blue crayon, and had to color with cerulean<UNAMUSED FACE><CYCLONE> haha
@BeatzByDrea I'm all out of crayons man, the struggle is real.
Another thing that bugs me is when people say they'll talk to you later, but they don't, and talk to everyone else later instead. HELLO.
I want to screen print. And make my own paper.
"You're homework is easy" #shitartmajorshate
Like don't put my major down, I have to MAKE something, not just follow the same book all the other whatever majors are reading.
My biggest pet peeve about my major is hearing stuff like "oh you just have to make something on the computer" or "oh you just blah blah"
My design project that is supposed to take me weeks is probably going to get done in a couple of hours tomorrow.
I was planning to be productive today though I swear.
As soon as I was going to start homework, my dad brings me work. Instantly stopped because homework isn't putting $20 in my pocket.
As predicted, that ruined my productivity for the remainder of the day.
I had all the dirty work today. Finding prices for calzones out of their packages <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
And then my coworker said she thought I could find prettier ones, so I didnt buy any <PENSIVE FACE><FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE><RING>
My hands have been feeling mighty naked so I was going to buy some rings.
Can't buy anything when you don't even like the way you feel really.
So I was going to shop today after work, tried one thing on, looked like shit and gave up on shopping.
I just want to shop, ugh.
Starving at workkkkk
Work 8am-4pm <TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE><TIRED FACE> I should be thankful for the new change in hours though, I'm going to need it to cover all this debt. #growingupsucks
It's early, I'm cold, I want to stay in bed forever.
Cher Lloyd is like perfect <UNAMUSED FACE> random late night thought. I'm jealous of pretty people with accents and tattoos lol
The music video was nice too like that was a pretty dress and location and it all tied together nicely. I'm like critiquing this video lol.
Ed Sheeran - Thinking Out Loud <THUMBS UP SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
If you aren't a little jealous, something's wrong here.
@jenxstagram wow, oops. It's the link that counts..
"Cause nobody knows you baby the wayyyyy I do &amp; nobody loves you baby the wayyy I do" can I please be Perry and be Mrs. Malik.
I went from Taylor to One Direction. It's like I HATE YOU to I LOVE YOU honestly lol
Omfg I need to buy this album, holy shit <FLUSHED FACE><FACE WITH COLD SWEAT><TIRED FACE><DIZZY FACE><SKULL> I'm not even done with it. Honest reactions<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Wow wow wow, @jenxstagram you were right. 
Listening to 1989 trying not to cry, lmao it's so good why why why, I hate Taylor Swift <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<BROKEN HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<BROKEN HEART>
Going to the gym before work tomorrow.... Let's hope my sister actually wake up sice we start at 8...
If you want to laugh, check out my snapchat where you can see my sister watching the walking dead. It's much better than the show itself.
I daydream of things I'd like to happen. Like I have very detailed daydreams. I probably dream more in the day than I do at night.
I'd just like to see someone own up to their wrongs for once. Can it be that hard? Obviously.
It'd be nice if a girl could just get some answers. It's cool if its what you want but whyyyyy .-.
No Bears game today means that work might actually be busy and I'll actually have a lot to clean. Omg.
"He'll regret it because those girls are nothing but a bunch of whores" thanks sis... Lol
I just have to find out when he's free and and and some plane tickets<THUMBS UP SIGN><AIRPLANE>️<BRIDGE AT NIGHT>
MY MOM SAID SHES SENDING ME TO SAN FRAN WITH MY COUSIN YASSSSS MOMMA YASSSS<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I need some new BFFs on snapchat.
I was so confused as to why Banksy was on my TL so much. I don't remember following him lol.
Yep yep. 
One day you'll probably meet someone that send you good morning, good afternoon, good evening, AND goodnight texts <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
GOOD FRKN MORNING TO EVERYONE THAT DOESNT GET GOOD MORNING TEXTS! <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<SUNFLOWER><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<SUNFLOWER><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<SUNFLOWER><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<SUNFLOWER><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>️<SUNFLOWER>
But then again I never get invited to things anyways, so I should have seen that coming.
I never went to a bonfire <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I never taste anything pumpkin spice related. (I think that's still possible though)
October is over and I never went to a haunted house.

I'm wishing for consistency in 2016 and that's rushing it. I have to figure out who the hell I am first &amp; that may take longer than a year..
I've been wanting to watch it for over a month now, it's probably not even in theaters.....
I need to go on a movie date ASAP and watch that stupid Nicholas Sparks movie and cry my friggin eyes out over fictional love.
“@WhosWaDe: Can I have this pls 
Ok I need to get off Twitter now, everyone's probably like STFU <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
Hearts need a reset button.
I feel like I have so much to say and like I have no one to talk to. <THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
I remember back in the day when I would get a rose once a month. Everything was so much nicer a few years ago.
Oh yeah and the guilt of being skinny.
The only negative thing about trying to lose weight, is getting dizzy.
The only positive thing I see happening passed all of this is the weight loss.
Why am I home on a Saturday night? Oh yeah, I'm me.
Obviously not for this year, but hopefully next year. Basic cute shit I want to accomplish before I die.
“@auuil: wait WAIT wait WAIT WAIT WAIT I'm in shock i'm alive but not breathing 
Never been sent flowers either... Or taken ice skating in the city.... Or been kissed on New Years. I feel a bucket list arising.
Never been kissed under mistletoe. I say this because Xmas music was already playing at work and I just realized that all late lol
Why the hell do I tear apart old scars<TIRED FACE>
But now that probably will never happen for me and I'm going to be like 90s Chandler Bing before Monica and die alone.
Most people wouldn't want that but I'm crazy enough to have taken it.
I wish certain things didn't happen over the summer so that maybe I wouldn't feel so alone.
December is going to be a bitch. So much was supposed to happen .-.
So my sister reminded me that what comes around goes around. Let's hope karma is on her period and having a bad day when it all comes around
My manager was like like wow you fold fast. Yes. Yes I do.
My back kills. I've never folded so much so quickly in my whole life. <WEARY FACE>
I thought everything was good and then I was reminded I'm not white, pretty, or in a sorority.
Cut every tie I have to you, cause your loves a fucking drag. #patd
Mexican mom advice:
"Te hablo?" 
"No"
"A la chingada pues!" lol
Monica broke my seashell lamp! 
IM GOING TO DIE ALONE!
You win..
For my birthday, I want an eharmony account lol jk fuck that.
JANICE GOT MARRIED BEFORE HIM FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
"You all are probably going to get married and I'm going to be alone!" If I didn't know Chandler ends up with Monica, I'd agree.
Damn I feel like having a bonfire for all this stuff.
If I knew how much I was worth 4 years ago, I probably would have been living completely differently.
My level of productivity today <THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN><THUMBS DOWN SIGN>

do some squats and make them cry

wishin they still had dat ass
Totes jelly of all the awesome couples costumes I've seen so far. Damn.
No right? Not unless I throw it while it's still on fire.
If I want to burn something and say, throw it in another lawn, is that considered arson?
If someone says they don't celebrate Halloween, and they go to a Halloween party, will they go to hell? I hope so. And soon.
Girls don't need to chase boys. A man will actually do something about a situation if he wants you.
My sister and moms advice<THUMBS UP SIGN>
I had dreams and goals of where I wanted my life to be in the future. Those are all gone now.
I forgot there's a ten word limit to everything I say. That's probably why I got ignored again.
Hardly got any sleep, definitely not interested in eating, and I'll probably get treated like crap by people I don't even know at work.
How's it possible to still want something that's killing you
Honestly don't think I have the energy to go to work tonight <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Waking up three hours later after falling asleep because of nightmares.... Really, as if my reality wasn't bad enough? :'/
I just think Kourtney's got it made.
I want Scott Disick to be my boyfriend and give me two and a half perfect babies and and yeah.
I want to be Kourtney Kardashian.
We made popcorn balls. <GHOST><JACK-O-LANTERN>#Halloween #popcorn #foodDIY lol 
Alrighty time to clean the house because my Asian bae is coming over and we're going fuck shit up with hair dye.
“@FemalePains: Is it just me or? 
I'm the type of person that always wants an answer. Don't leave me wondering.
Because it's ok to make ugly faces today... 
Love drunk
I have yet to eat some berries.
These photos are nice, but I need to find an interesting spot for moreeee ...
Lol I need to get back to workkkkk <WEARY FACE>
Thirteen hours later I'm still staring at my phone like a dumb ass.
And asking them what they want to be in August. Lol
When I have kids, I'll probably start designing and making their Halloween costumes in September.
It's seriously very scary so I'm glad he hasn't found it
My dads been complaining all week about not being able to find his scary mask to wear today.
I want to go to Walmart. But not alone. Is that weird.
I forgot today was payday.
Just kidding I have so many projects.
9:15 and I'm already bored.
October has been the worst month so far, somehow I don't see November being any better <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
So last night I learned I've been living a lie for way too long <PENSIVE FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
I just keep hoping that one day something so much better is going to happen to me<PENSIVE FACE>
<CLOUD>️<HIGH VOLTAGE SIGN>️<DROPLET><UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>️
@jenxstagram nvm then you're fired
@jenxstagram k you can't mess up. I can't afford this.
And because I suddenly craved a gyro... And chipotle.
I should probably sleep soon since I need to take my niece to school tomorrow.
I just have an idea of what I would have liked to dress up as today, but I probably won't dress up and that's sad<PENSIVE FACE>
I'm obviously never sleeping in since I work 8am on Monday. Wtf.
I just need to be skinny and white.
Why was I born this way.
That's pretty funny. Disappointing as hell. But funny.
Seeing people's responses after they've been caught up with their crap &gt;&gt;&gt;
I would like to meet someone that actually likes talking to me. But I don't socialize enough for that to happen. So that's not happening.
I honestly don't ask for much, but the fact that I have to ask for basic things should be telling me a lot more.
Can someone bleach my hair tomorrow? No? Right because I'm the only one without plans.
She's like you never called me back! And he doesn't even remember her name but blames her for her never calling back. Like what. No. Stupid.
Watching Friends and seeing how Joey blames the girl for something he messed up because he doesn't want to admit it was him. Typical.
Really hoping my future husband spoils me. Not with material things, but with more thoughtful things. Unless it's my birthday. I like stuff
I wish I had a shit ton of friends to have fun with. I will probably say that and stay wondering what the hell fun us until the day I die.
#disappointed
The longer I'm left in silence, the more bs I'm going to think.
Wow I'm really sleepy.
*hell
Class ended early. Woo. What he'll do I do now ..
I want to go home. 
Life sucks in general.
Telling someone something you don't like and then it being done to you on purpose SUCKS ASS.
I'm hungryyyyyyyyyyyyyy <DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Bored. And I want hot chocolate. I should walk there. But it's cold.
Starving and I don't want to eat my lame sandwich <WEARY FACE>
Read. Ignore. Repeat. 
K
Jk I can't ditch these classes <UNAMUSED FACE>
Or now since I already want to leave.
Who wants to pick me up from school tonighttttttttttttttttt?<WEARY FACE>
"She's been my queen since we were sixteen, we want the same things, we dream the same dreams"
There was so much sass and bitchiness in my answers. I hope he feels it while he grades it
Hey let's give a midterm where you guys make up the questions BUT JUST KIDDING let me include all this other shit we never learned<GRINNING FACE>
I hate being blamed for everything.
There's going to be a Halloween party in my building while I'm in class..... -.- 
Not even five minutes in the city and I already almost got hit by a car -.-
@jenxstagram I want to buy the presale tickets already because I know it's just going to cost more later <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Shoot I might just go alone with the prices of those damn tickets....................
@marlenaa96 see I would have said that, but I didn't want to sound high maintenance<PERSON FROWNING> lol
But since I'm no longer the type to wait around and hope for things to happen, I'm just going to buy myself some tickets. Lol
Or some nice boots or a northface.
All I want for my birthday is tickets to see one direction.
Why do I go to a councilor about school things if she doesn't even help -.-
I wish my councilor would have told me that I would be behind after I told her I was going to drop a course. Way to look out for me lady.
I'm already behind 3 credits in college meaning I probably need to take LAS classes at triton <WEARY FACE>
In a room full of dogs and my puppy was the quietest one not bothering to bark at any single one of them <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><DOG FACE>
I could point out so many grammar mistakes in presentations. You expect me to trust these people with my grade?
We supposedly learn through some weak presentations and then go blind into the test like what.
It's seriously stupid because it's test questions the students create and they supposedly "teach" you what you need to know.
I should be studying for the dumb ass test I have tomorrow.
Black or bleach?
I want to bleach it again. But then I'm like really bad with bleach.
I'm two seconds away from going to Walgreens and buying hair dye. Lol. Omg.
Same potatoes, different day.
Greatest photography book my schools library owns: 
These moms are hilarious. Calm down ladies, it's just a volleyball game, I'm sorry your kids suck.... Lol
I want beanies. A plethora of colorful beanies..... And scarves.
I really wish cheetos were 0 calories.
“@SoReIatable: Me dealing with my responsibilities 
A girl in class just asked me what I was doing for Halloween. Her reaction to when I said nothing was great.
Tis cold
It's crazy carelessly people hurt others.
Back to my usual nights :/
Priorities have clearly changed for some people.
Holy fuck is my patience being tested to a whole new extreme today.
There's about a hundred sarcastic and evil tweets I could tweet right now and I'm dying trying to control that urge.
Love my design class. The only class where the teacher and students talk crap about other teachers and what class NOT to take lol
My drive way looked so nice this morning <MAPLE LEAF><FALLEN LEAF><ONCOMING AUTOMOBILE> 
7 hours of standing and folding and and telling people where the bathroom and fitting room is starts in 10 minutes... <PERSEVERING FACE> lol
2 steps forward and then like a mile back.
So U know that picture trending about flowers being only $4? I was at jewel and they actually are. Why aren't there more happy girls?
Main topic of conversation when you're with Ecuadorians and you're half Mexican: so do you eat more rice or tortillas at home....?

I'll be counting the hours since that's all I'm good for. Hashtag, annoyed.
And I was upset because our table didn't have white wine. Totes kidding, this one didn't disappoint. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Well. If anything, this is the best red wine I've ever tasted.
Bored af. Done nothing but pin all night. I wana go sleep -.-
Just got asked if I was married yet. I wanted to say I wish, but ya know, parents. Lol
Well this is the first time my parents are actually asking me if I just want to stay. But I would be bored af alone.
Can I just stay home and play with a ouija board in some cemetery.
Halloween cupcakes with my nieces after a long day of carving pumpkins! #cupcake 
I'm only 30 minutes late...... Could be worse.
She called this morning saying don't forget to go to the dentist, OH YEAH OF COURSE. Lmao woops.
First dentist appointment alone. Tell my mom don't worry I'll remember. Totally forgot.
Is this considered a real life pillow pet...? #puppyproblems 
When ur schedule is the opposite of ur availability... Ok. Let's just hope it doesn't mess with all my projects <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
There was absolutely nothing wrong with today. Maybe my brain is not allowing me to be happy and reminding me of little things that bug me.
Had a crazy amazing day today so why am I feeling upset?! <DISAPPOINTED FACE> My brain needs to stop.
Hashtaggggggg#selfie <INFORMATION DESK PERSON> 
Back to my hunger strike <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
Blueberries and strawberries in yogurt with almonds, chocolate covered strawberries, berries in smoothie form, omg <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT><FEARFUL FACE><FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>

It's legible, not distorted, and different! Just overlapped. Like wow. How rude.
He says make it different. And I do. And he says we can't do that. THE FUDGE.
My type teacher is a hardcore hater of my work.
Mooooooooooooose 
So I kinda sorta really love this dark purple color. Much better than the blue.

Just witnessed an 11 year old solve a rubix cube with one hand on the train. That was pretty magical. Lol
“@SoReIatable: When bae starts acting up 
Craving popcorn chicken. Or Gene and Jude's.
Field trip to our own museum.... Woo -.-
Someone's smoking jolly ranchers again!!!!! It's 8am, wth lol
The Jackson stop smells like chorizo.
<SUN BEHIND CLOUD>️ 
He gets really happy when he sees only certain people's work. I would like to fall under that category of happiness <UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS>️
I NEED BETTER REACTIONS THAN THAT DUDE <WEARY FACE>
Because in like artist/design lingo that means my work is average.
My teacher just says "you're doing well" and that bothers the hell out of me.
My 4 hour class was just a work day. Normally this would bother me because I commute. But I actually get shit done. So.
Someone took the elevator one floor up. Die.
Someone was smoking something that smelled like jolly ranchers. Hipsters.
One stop away from going back to the smell of nicotine, woo<SMOKING SYMBOL> -.- lol
Not even casually but like laser staring wtf lol I'm creeped out
That awkward moment where U catch someone staring at U on the train......
My niece kicks ass at volleyball. She scored like 7 points with those awesome serves. I was impressed.… 
I want to watch ouija and I want a ouija board phone case because of this movie lol
I need Chapstick. #ow

Oh hi, it's Monday. #mcm 
Dressed like a typical prep/hipster/whatever thinking that would work to my advantage in the mean department of the store. It didn't.
My sister watches the walking dead. And I watch my sister. Her reactions are priceless. And all on snapchat now. Lol
If I look skinnier then I'm getting the results I want <RELIEVED FACE> Finally, somethings actually changing <UNAMUSED FACE>
Lol my parents are funny "what's wrong, you look too skinny, why don't you eat?"
I'd ask but I already feel like I'll just get blown off, so.
I find it hard to believe it's that difficult to send a text.
I miss my birthday sister, why did she have to leave so early from work <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I want to get dressed up and go somewhere. Like that sounds fun.
Forever waiting<SPEECH BALLOON><PENSIVE FACE>
Lunch time with no lunch. Yum.
Well now I know iMessage is broken again but Twitter works just fine.
Of course not.
Has my phone rang?
This is just a game, it's a beautiful lieeeeeeeeeeee; holy guac I forgot how good old 30STM music was.
My house to work: 12mins. 
I think that's a new record for me.
This shits actually ice. W.t.f. -.- 
"You look too skinny you don't eat" 
*thats the point*
Too early. And I couldn't sleep for shiiiiiznitz.
<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><UNAMUSED FACE><ROSE><POT OF FOOD> 
Just scrolled through fifty million couple posts on Instagram. Ok.
And that's how I'm going to cheer myself up dammit.
I'm going to buy myself flowers and chocolate, and take myself to stuff my face at Olive Garden, and then cry about how much I ate.
I keep undervaluing myself and that's got to stop.
I can already see all of this being turned around to me, and how somehow everything became my fault. Nope. Not having it.
If you ever are questioning whether or not you're being taken advantage of, feel free to ask me. I've become an expert at these things<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Bullshit bullshit bullshit. Holy fuck.
Fuck being someone's second choice.
The fuck was sweetest day?
But seriously, I need to make my own plans if I ever want to get out for a bit.
Can someone take me out to get chocolate wasted next weekend.
For some reason the universe has chosen me to have a sneak preview of hell.
Can't wait for the day I'm actually appreciated and valued.
Lies lies lies.
You'd think it makes things better, sure, but no.
Being the bigger person just bit me in the ass.
"I'd pick hanging out with you over guys any day." If ur a girl, never fall for this line.
That pain of getting ready to see someone and then not seeing them. Yeah, it sucks being a girl. Where's the make up remover..?
Shittiest 18th.
I did my hair and make up to sit in my room.
So I blew off Ecuadorean food for nothing.
Another depressing weekend.
I've been getting crazy dizzy when I get upset. Doesn't seem normal.
And now my internet committed suicide so I can't even write my responses. Officially bored.
Rare moment where almost all my homework is done...
My handwriting looks like you hit shuffle when picking out a typeface.
I mean do homework...<GRINNING FACE>
Idk if I want to go out to eat with my parents, or stay home and watch Harry Potter.
To read for class or nap... ?
That probably didn't make any sense. But it does in my hurting head<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH> lol
I refuse to fight off this headache with pain killers because I think I can kill pain on my own <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
My paycheck and more is already gone<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
One bill paid off, 3 more to go <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
For some reason I want to get chocolate wasted. Oh, and remove chocolate from the sentence.
Wtfffffffff. After today I'm so not looking back.
Anywayssss, it's too early. Back to my nightmares I go :)
Maybe doing the exact same bs will be fun. Who the hell knows.
If this is all a fucked up scheme to be stupid on a Saturday and then Sunday is all of a sudden better, I should really find something to do
Makes no sense to chase after someone that doesn't even care about anything but themselves. When will I learn that -.-
If someone doesn't care, then why should I even try -___-
Cue the regret.
I've had my priorities all wrong for too long.
I need to learn to be happy again and not care.
In other words, just a reminder to move on and quit waiting around for something no one else cares about. Ouchhhhhhhhhh.
I should probably sleep now.
So the guy that looks better than all the girls in my class has super cute tats and I told him I may or may not steal them.
I want a ouija board phone case.
Wow what a piece of shit.
So tomorrow's the 18th. And sweetest day. Ironic isn't it? Lol #fuckyouoctober
Like it's a start but I get shut down, so I need to stop.
Fucked up that I make a tiny efforts for nothing.
My phone can ring now. Or not. K.
Holy shit I feel better after talking to my sister.
the way I get treated like shit for no reason does not make sense but I guess that's karma and it should make some people very happy
I have cheetos. And I have lime. But I'm not eating them. Why.
5:42pm.
“@drunkonJared: @UpInTheAir1217 this has some good ideas on what can help 
Wtf Olive Garden is invading my TL, like stop I'm on a hunger strike <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> lol
My eyes don't see much actually... #blind
If anyone has any advice on how to shoot abstract photography that would really help me not fail this assignment. My eyes don't see abstract
I have yet to go on an Olive Garden date. But I'm sure one day someone will be crazy enough to take me so I can stuff my face with carbs.
Just remembered it's Friday and I gave myself until the weekend anddd my phone hasn't made a peep, so.
I wish I had some type of video game console so I can at least say I'm just going to stay in and play video games.
<CLOCK FACE THREE OCLOCK><CLOCK FACE THREE-THIRTY><CLOCK FACE FOUR OCLOCK> wasting my day <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
Harry Potter movies start in 15 minutes. Yay for accents and magic.
Nothing annoys me more than when I'm being nagged to eat.
A chick flick I actually want to watch. 
K thx. 
My homework may or may or be a reflection of my current feelings. #graphicdesign #photoshop 
Because three 100% average out to 99.25%.... K. #artschool #obviouslynotmathclass 
How abouttttt, no.
My parents just got really upset that I don't have any plans this weekend and told me to find something to do other than homework.
To think I wanted to buy boots and watch a movie<LOUDLY CRYING FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><MONEY WITH WINGS>
Goodbye savings account. Not like I'll be needing you anymore. Growing up sucks.
When ur bills for the month are over twice as much more than what you make&lt; #fuck
Didn't work. And usually people WANT to go back to bed and continue their dream. This one wouldn't go awayyyyyy <WEARY FACE>
Literally stayed in bed for two hours trying to go back to sleep and dream a different dream.
“@Dory: Puberty hit him like a truck <ARTICULATED LORRY> 
Reasons all good things come to an end: lack of communication and pure laziness.
And she told me our school gives married people more financial aid, so, she's got that going for her lol
Now I just think it's awesome that she has someone that loves her like THAT much to already put a ring on it.
Found out a girl from my class I initially thought was a bit weird, is actually engaged.
My photoshop homework is so easy, I'm going to get very dramatic with what I turn in. I've been using layer masks since I was in diapers(jk)
Pandoraaaaaaaa <THUMBS UP SIGN> 
... <CONFUSED FACE><HOURGLASS>️ 
Ok seriously this is depressing. Wtf does a girl have to do to stop being emotionally unstable???
If I were to die right now, I'd probably still be stuck in this shit hole because of unfinished business. Haunting everyone. Boo. <SKULL><GHOST>
I suppose I tried <CONFUSED FACE>
I'm the type of person that people won't reply to <PENSIVE FACE> #k #potassium
Craving a gyro <FLUSHED FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
50 more minutes of class<HOURGLASS>️
Forgot my pain killers, I'm not going to last being 8 hours in front of a computer screen.
Someone gave me an all day ventra card I don't need, if I see someone asking for change for the train/bus I can give them this. #gooddeed
I'm going to take a bunch of pain killers and energy drinks. It's going to be a lonnnggggggggggg night in the city.
Twitter is the only thing not broken, iMessage is very broken.
I'll be on Twitter a lot to distract me from doing something i could possibly regret.
Well I just had the best dream ever. Sucks that's never happening though <WEARY FACE>
Time to sleeppppppp and see ya in my dreams, woo <WEARY FACE>

@BeatzByDrea lol awh Andrea!!!! Did u not water it?? I'm sure this plant just got lonely and took its roots to a forest... :(
But unfortunately that's never going to happen. It's crazy sweet to see that I'm thought of like that to her though... ://

<FLUSHED FACE> pretty old song <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES> 
This phone better be doing some ringing or I'm finally going to find something else to preoccupy my life with<FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH><BOMB>
Giving up if I have another shitty weekend. I'll call that my breaking point. Can't be miserable two weekends in a row.
I'm always the first to break the silence, for once I'm going to leave it this way to see if I was really the only one interested <CONFUSED FACE>
Day three: suicidal mode..... Totes kidding but couldn't be closer lol <WEARY FACE>
That was like the most entertaining thing I'd do when I'd be bored or awkwardly waiting for the elevator lol.
I just touched my hand to twist my ring. But there's no ring. So. Womp.
Can I just go to school in England and marry someone with an accent and gentlemenlike qualities? Oh yeah and good looking. Can't forget.
The tattoo I really wanted would be ridiculous to get now after everything omg lol whyyyy <PERSON FROWNING>
It's just a bunch of formulas. I don't see how that's confusing unless the problem is worded funky.
I think I'm the only one that knows wtf is going on in optics class.
Seems like a great definition. Or description. Whatever it is.
Corinthians 13:4-8 verse is my lock screen now as a reminder what love is supposed to look like.
Unless they decide to delete me from their life too. Then I have no idea wtf is real.
From this I learned I'm not allowed to have a shitty day at work. And unconditional love is a myth if it's not by your parents.
I think it's crazy how much things change. Like wow, I was having a bad day. And now I'm here. Having more bad days differently.
@xxXOfTheSeaXxx because Dean is so fucking cute.
I'm being haunted. And only one out of the two things is dead.
Second day I see a jeep parked outside my building and feel like breaking its windows. Then I snap out of it and think it's not it anyway.
Love kills.
And the sad feelings just seeped in. Alrighty. Thanks brain.
#cityproblems
Now all these people are trying to distribute themselves throughout 14 floors and 4 elevators.
Fire alarm. From the 11th floor. My dumb ass wanted to take the elevator.
They're talking about baby names in my class. Please. Stop. -.-
Pinterest is the only thing keeping me from having a crazy meltdown.
Wait for it 
Wish I had a BFF that went to another college so they could take me to their homecoming games and parties and stuff. Accepting applications.
Last year I looked forward to this weekend. This year I'm seeing I'm just wasting my time putting my hopes up. Second year in a row.
Lol I'm the dumbass that makes the mistake at looking at old pictures. I was fine for a minute, ugh, why.
In the meantime, I'll be dreaming. <SLEEPING SYMBOL> 
I'm never going to be able to sleep with this toothache. <CONFOUNDED FACE>
Like she's had an eating disorder, been depressed and addicted to drugs, and now she's engaged (I think). Like damn. Happy endings exist..?
After hearing about Demi Lovato's speech. It gives me hope.
Am I the only one that's been called all these things??? Literally. Joking or not, it sticks. 
I had planned to watch The Best Of Me at the movies the 18th. But it seems I'm spending it alone. Womp womp.
It's official, I have thunder thighs. I'm signing up at planet fitness. <TIRED FACE><BOMB><PISTOL>
- people who stay when your life gets rough
- people who leave when your life gets rough
- people who make…
Seriously there really are some terrible people in this world and I seem to attract 99% of them.
THANK YOU to whoever took the time to say something I worked really hard on was a waste of time!
Lol!!!! I love how bad I get put down from people in person and now online!
My teeth hurt worse than when I had braces. Mix that with a nasty headache and empty stomach and consider me close to death.
Staying after school to do homework would be a lot cooler if it didn't take me an hour to get home afterwards. Still not done. #thestruggle
It's getting dark. Still not done with photography. &amp; I'm a tad scared about taking the train late after all the robberies... Oh well<FLUSHED FACE>
Yep. Definitely regret not bringing an umbrella and extra hoodie. Fml.
My teachers wife is also a graphic designer. That's got to be awesome. I can picture them arguing about typefaces. Lol
Life is seriously too short to be so upset. But I'm wasting it on it anyways. #memories
Forearm tattoos. Wow.
I'm going to frkn lose my scholarship, omg my grades are dropping <DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
FML I FORGOT MY BOOK <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
So tell me what we're fighting for 'cause I know that the truth means so much more. #whyarethejonasbrothersinmyplaylist
I already know what stops I'm going to lose signal in.
Late af. And no umbrella.
Waking up and realizing that everything wasn't a bad dream.
And with that, 
Goodnight <SKULL><SPARKLES> 
Wisdom teeth feel like they're mining down from my brain. These headaches and toothaches aren't fun.


-take a nap
-spend 4 hours on twitter
-cry
People just can't read the signs. And then act like jerks on purpose as if that's going to help. No lady, you're just making my day worse.
Then she started to be rude and mean as hell. Like what? Mad I'm not a white girl like you thought?
Some lady at work pretty much whispered to her friend I seemed dumb and would change the price in Spanish. Then I started speaking Spanish.
Eye lashes are falling out.... Now I get to be ugly on the inside and out. That should make some people happy I bet.
F- 
Worst Monday of October so far<SKULL><BOMB>

Hunger + lack of sleep + talked to like crap for asking at work + treated like crap for asking outside of work = worst day of my life <CRYING FACE>
Sleepy. Hungry. With a headache. There's no reason a retail store should be open before 10am<WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>

Somebody on this train smells like hollister... <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
I need sleep. Days, not just hours of sleep, dayssssss.

I'm the perfect person to ignore, taking advantage of, and demand things from. I have an outstanding tolerance for bs if you ask me.
Too much time on indesign. I'm seeing grid lines when I text <FLUSHED FACE>
That stuff is for people that understand how many people are in a relationship....... Oh yeah and love and shit..
I used to be in a rush to grow up, ya know get married and stuff. Buttttttttt now I'm really not even interested in that little dream.
Getting the final as a midterm = STRESS
My friends bf bought her the cutest boots I've ever seen <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
Like I'm trying to multitask between designs here and I'm feeling claustrophobic.
I NEED A BIGGER SCREEN <TIRED FACE>
It's cool to see how difficult it is to design a book or magazine though. I'm sure struggling.
Why am I graphic design major with a concentration on publication design when that shits gna be gone <WEARY FACE>
Anyone else have a love hate relationship with illustrator? Because I sure do <UNAMUSED FACE><WEARY FACE> #graphicdesignprobs 
Swear to shake it up.
