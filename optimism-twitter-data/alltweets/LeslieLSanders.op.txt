You know Twitter makes it easy to find those who follow you then unfollow after you followed back. The "follows you" under their name.
Crazy how many people follow u, wait till u follow back, then unfollow. Really?! And almost all of mine were authors! O.o  NOT COOL.

Good morn. Sent my short story off for a critique, which means I was happy with my final draft. Now I must wait for feedback. #amwriting
@EmmaLaiWrites I teeter back and forth with "This is brilliant!" to "Uh, needs more work." That's what the rewrites are doing to me. lol.
