@AapGhumaKeLeyLo <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>@waglenikhil
@Hitarth1987 people trolling flipkart.. then post the screenshots..
@ajayendar her subsequent tweets are even more pathetic..." typical"words used for terrorist..
@ajayendar don't look far we have indian Masala justifying it.

I don't find trolling company support handles funny.. AT ALL..
@DraggoTigger this handle is in perpetual paranoia n most things lies.
Waah.. the mighty pillars of democracy who detest absolute free speech.. justifying terrorism,. India has no hope. 
<HEAVY BLACK HEART> 
@GappistanRadio not happening it will get worse
@RWSupporterGuy why should it? We need alliances going forth..we r nt going to get 282 next any time.. neither win Punjab on our own
@Phani_Acharla downfall..
@rcallimachi dead in terrorist attacks.. not in this case.. we have been reduced to that society..culprits hog more space than victims.
@ajayendar the problem is we are all subconsciously affected by MSM.. knowingly or unknowingly we base our opinions cz of it.
Don't do that @AmitShahOffice ..You know what happened in m'hrstra..n we cn see hw bjp is handling bihar/up/wb.  
@ajayendar that cannot really blamed on anybody but our ignorance..
@indiantweeter one thing that helped my family household..i did nt party 80-90rs per kilo for onions or any vegetable. De regulation too.
@indiantweeter cz you are not aam admi but celeb
@TarekFatah shame on nytimes..she is repeatedly justifying the killings.. nyt disappointd evn durin charlie hebdo @nytimes @rcallimachi
Awww how is it that on news about any other party clarifications don't come so thick n fast?

@DraggoTigger yes it will..
Wow so that justifies killings..see people u so dumb..she found the reason for terrorists to exist. @nytimes kudos  
@DraggoTigger he is pointless.. fr that matter i would say anybody from bjp would say this media would go on a picnic trial fr 3 days min,
@DraggoTigger he has threatened the media but see the stoic silence? Imagine modi had said exact same thing.
@DraggoTigger so quick.. that's credit to aap
@suhasranganath verified.. removed :)

@astoldbybria__ usa is usa...saudi is saudi arabia..iran is iran all fr a reason and we the youth must nt let the beacon of free speech down
@astoldbybria__ sure... when i meant you... i meant its for all of us.. to ponder..
@astoldbybria__ upholding freedom of speech n if at all peaceful protests is duty of every sane citizen..justifying killings is wrong.
@astoldbybria__ rmbr today they would find this provocative,tom it will be the way one dresses...bcz they don't really need a reason to kill
Wow we have terrorists sympathisers,terrorism justifiers everywhere..its just too depressing that people think any reason is alright to kill
@astoldbybria__ so essentially you are justifying clamp down on free speech.. good luck America with such views
Ah the same janata ka reporter which rifat jawaid is hosting n varun gandhi wished him for! 
When will AAP allege the women is a BJP member?  
We have terrorists apologists all over the world. Go on... 
Now aaptards,congressis will start liking n supporting  al qaeda too n no two ways abt it. 
@Blazingcatfur ofcourse evidently she doesn't.  @RachelLynn2911
@astoldbybria__ cz USA is a free country...ppl r said n let to do wat they want,would drawing Jesus or any other god lead to brutal killing?
This had to come from somebody in @nytimes..spineless even during charlie Hebdo.,, "free speech aside" says it all. 
@astoldbybria__ You sure know that you are justifying terrorists act right?

@DraggoTigger clearly is..
@DraggoTigger but gullible RW 
Hahaha so after @gauravcsawant now it is @rahulkanwal time to be hated by AAPtards n congressis.. why? Cz he reportd abt RSS work in nepal.
More than anything it is.the modi hate that is manifesting into ugly vicious forms. Hopeless.

I cant seem to change twitter trending location to Nepal...anybody else can?
@ArmchairPseph @doubtinggaurav yes.. and thats why we are saying 
@lals131999 never ending hai re

@ArmchairPseph also tell me if you can set twitter trends to Nepal... you can't. @doubtinggaurav @rajudasonline
@ArmchairPseph who is denying that?? We are talking abt the sustained trend n wt it has turned into. @doubtinggaurav @rajudasonline
@ARangarajan1972 the lovely liberals.have attributed it to modi already..
@ArmchairPseph @doubtinggaurav 
It keeps getting clearer. 

@mahesh10816 @lals131999 don't help trend that hashtag see the series of tweets

@girirajsinghbjp cz of indians n pakis <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> 
But ofcourse AAPtards &amp; congressis have made it all abt anti modi / anti india sentiment supprtd by pakis.

@India_Policy see the series of tweets here

Funny how suddenly adarshliberals hve an issue with "nationalist" journos &amp; hve twistd the trend to blaming those journos for PR of the govt
@totabola1 mr..nobdy is denying their anger..bt its not easy to sustain that trend. @abdullah_0mar @iGarima1 @love2speaktruth @narendramodi
Draw ur own conclusions: 
@Moskvaa @masoodkhan30 yes not easy to trend someting and sustain in for hours together.... siddenl.it has become modi pr bashing.
Exactly &amp; suddenly all of india's so called top journos speaking out against so calles "nationalist" journos..fishy.

@masoodkhan30 but you see again she is a indian..
@ask0704 it is..
As suspected ..the people trending abt indian media are Pakis and Indians..not exactly nepalese. 
@iMac_too it is esp with adarsh liberal journos frm india supporting it 
 @masoodkhan30 @s_navroop
@ask0704 but trust you me..in times of tragedy the Nepalese would not sit n trend something about indian media
@Hitarth1987 it is slowly turning into modi govt bashing.
@coolfunnytshirt me too

@c_aashish completely agree ..hw can modi be responsible for somebody's futuristic tweets.  @wallflower_ish
@wallflower_ish errr how exactly do you intend @narendramodi do that?
Maybe thats his and his ilks intentions. 
.@BollywoodGandu be a little responsible unlike @AmiteshSinghBJP..and dont tweet inflammatory stuff.
@Moskvaa i was really wondering that.i mean if it was inflammatory n u r responsible it would be reportd nt publicly posted @abdullah_omar
@nayanikaaa obv... bt he is crapping now.. he is in for trouble..
@DraggoTigger check omar abdullah tl
@nayanikaaa that kid...check.omar tl.. he had occurred trouble big time
@abdullah_omar the tweet absolutely wrong..but you attributing it to modi is just so typical from you...
He is profusely apologising and shitting bricks... but then he..

@doctoratlarge no besharam was a  better pj <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD> @chintskap
@nayanikaaa @AgentSaffron it is intentional..they are party spokespersons they have been given this guideline.. its nt as simple as it seems
@AgentSaffron spokesperson.. n honestly looks like every spokesperson has been told to be brutal..nobdy is takin it kindly.
Exactly. To those who said he had valid criticisms they were far n few in between. 
@MeetUunngLee beautiful photos.. u really are a good photographer :)
@BihariTweeter lol n few others..
If you keep criticisin,questionin,shoutin,doubtin, anythin all the time every single day every hour then remember u wnt be taken seriously.
Bloody annoying... where were these concerns for 60yrs. Such liars.. such looters.. and media won't even ask. 
@doctoratlarge white skin complex exists more amidst our elite than the poor.
So rahul is talking about a bill which was rejected.  
@ankur0906 have no freaking clue..must be the buyer vadra has some special law.
@India_Progress but everyday 24/7 analysis is pointless..we voted him for 5yrs so i wil gve him dat.. rest constructive criticism is welcome
@BihariTweeter wahi na... tho karein bhi.. ye dilli ke arun's ..modi ji ke jeena haram kar rahe hai
@BihariTweeter haan phir 2 saal baad wapas bjp se resign karenge aur kuch bolenge

Modi should nt wear a suit after takin gandhi's name,amit shah shud nt do aggressive campaignin in WB..like wtf

@SecularTrainee and i think he fears that clearly...
@alok_bhatt @narendramodi not at all...he said many many more damamging things..n this counts for nothing.
Bjp shd not spread,snide personal attacks on jaitely/modi,bjp shud embrace oppositn,modi shd tweet on evry minority rumor..rubbsh of shourie
@SecularTrainee truely...he has been filled with hatred today.
@alok_bhatt and yes modi should tweet on ghar wapasi n minority issues everytime.. wow. Shourie sir has been at his vindictive at his best.
@alok_bhatt xtian attack real? Bjp shud embrace.opposition? Bjp shud nt spread footprint? Modi should change his nature? Wt next?
@alok_bhatt lol really? The last 20mins is everythin rw fought fr against media n liberal agenda &amp; that is right? Cool then.
@alok_bhatt AS did not even counter it..but repeated again after KT. so no they are not wrong. @KaranThapar_TTP @aajtak
Shourie ji even has a prob with bjp expanding..like wtf is that about... 
Anybody here who has watched the interview n up to defend him?
@Hitarth1987 such words..such remarks.,carrying forward.lies.,bad stuff by shourie..too bad. @wallflower_ish @KunwarAnkit @prasannavishy
@MahuNr71 the last section was disgusting for me
Case of sour grapes by shourie ji...he carries forward every lie without countering it...does a uturn on his own belief of secularism.Shame.
Shourie wants modi to tweet on churches..doesnt counter thapar abt Dec25th lies yet again n carries forward the lie abt suit. Hopeless.
Pathetic stuff by shourie..says govt not done enough for minority..he is surely bitter to be left out of the govt &amp; there is no denying tat
Buahahaha RW. yes yes shourie is being soooo right n logical in criticism... wtf..he says ribeiro n xtian attack atmosphere is right.. sick.
Wow modi's nature to be blamed..nice... shourie is turning into case of.bitter grapes totally.
@Leopard212 haanji bolo

@rupasubramanya Woah.. <OK HAND SIGN>
@AviralKapoor_ ha.. having a day off n stuck to bed with Twitter in hand had gotten me exhausted.
Not an expert but looks like he does have valid criticism of economy model of this govt.
@AviralKapoor_ no watch it.. :)
So till now looks like @narendramodi was to give shourie ji place in finance ministry which jaitely ji took away.. the bitterness is oozing.
Such snide remarks like jo hyper bole so nihaal.. cmon mr shourie u can do better. Ugh.
@MihirkJha he has been given fodder
Ohhhhh ouch... so it is jaitely versus shourie... <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Wow accusing govt of manufacturing headlines... lol which are these. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
He wanted the finance ministry clearly... he is being so bitter.. what a downfall shourie ji..
Karan thapar questions are so biased so pathetic... sigh but don't expect any better.
There you go.. the opening sentences gave it away... chalo shourie fans keep ur points of defence ready.. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>

@Hitarth1987 sure.
@Bharat_Putra great  @AndColorPockeT
@Hitarth1987 man of his stature can't be just ranting n think no repercussions will happen.

@Bharat_Putra who would even supprt advani on that jinnah issue.. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> @AndColorPockeT
I like shourie...but what really annoyed me is if he has really said abt @narendramodi ignoring this hypothetical minority attacks. Ugh.
@Hitarth1987 but he has written this govt off <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@AndColorPockeT exactly..conveniently forgotten now by rw.
@MukulAgarwal66 i disagree with things he has sis today..especially minority attacks being ignored
@MukulAgarwal66 i like him fr the reason bina kuch kaam kiye angoor khaate hai <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY> @bindaasbrat

@rahulroushan no it is not official website of his.products
@rahulroushan DM
@rahulroushan he has not ... there is a website whose admin 4yrs ago replies to a make child question.
@vivekagnihotri sataak.
@awanishr yes... and can be held accountable, my case in point is this one of ramdev official website.  @RoflGandhi_ @nayanikaaa
@maverickilroy issue is they hve specified male child in question n vaidya hs nt corrected the same. @RoflGandhi_ @nayanikaaa @CrimeMasterV2
@c_aashish hahaha.. i haven't had any interaction with him to date.. this is the first.. n its been sane.
@awanishr @nayanikaaa @RoflGandhi_ says it is fron.admin...so it is wrong..atleast they could have said med doesn't promise ex of the child.
@RoflGandhi_ you can't be responsible for those comments.. so no need for apology.  @nayanikaaa
@c_aashish haha..first-time ever..but yes it was.
@nayanikaaa likewise. @RoflGandhi_
Aarrrgghh fron where do these idiotic AAPtards creep in from.. will ruin any sensible convo. 
@nayanikaaa but is it ramdev's official website? @RoflGandhi_
@nayanikaaa yes agree.  @RoflGandhi_
@RoflGandhi_ if it is by the admin then it is wrong n can be held accountable whoever it is. @nayanikaaa
@rahulroushan
Also the second pic explains the sanskrit too. 

@MukulAgarwal66 you are so right... we are not ready to give this govt 2 years  let alone 5.
