@mylasiddique thank you Myla! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@LadyNonchalance I'm all about aesthetics okay, don't hate
Saying this because using white borders just ruins the look on your Instagram profile. I used to love them, now I hate them so much lol

OMLLLLL THIS IS HORRIBLE WTF 
@EMAILSB tbh we don't really know because we haven't personally met the majority of the world. It's a big world...
@EMAILSB the way I see it:

if you're not finding a solution, then you're part of the problem.

@mylasiddique just put your phone away and sleep lol. Least you have the choice. Some can't even get that luxury
@mylasiddique bleh. I can't sleep and I'm worried sick over someone. You?
@mylasiddique you won't annoy me.
@mylasiddique actually I am because you're just basically watching me and not saying/doing anything
For me it's more rather what people have done than what people have said.

After all, actions do speak louder than words.
"Oh, this guy? He looks like a rapist." 
Fucking hell. Whoever told you that needs their neck broken. 
I'm just gonna lie here and listen to loads of romantic love songs whilst I reread this conversation and imagine various scenarios. Calm.
Romance. What a beautiful art form. Such a shame how it isn't alive as much anymore.
@EMAILSB sweet, we can be forever alone together <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I wish I had some Batman comics to read.
@a_neesa18 eh, probably better that way. I might vlog about it idk LOL
@a_neesa18 I'm saying this at completely the wrong time lol
Talking like I even have a wife and kids when I'm actually a miserable loner with a dream.
Nah. Idc, if you have a problem with me, take it up with me, leave them out of it.
I've seen WAAAAAAAAAAY too many people insult kids - yes KIDS - for their looks etc in the most horrible ways imaginable.
Not everyone wants to see you happy in life and there is no freaking way I'm letting the people I love most be involved with that.
Call me weird but I actually wouldn't want to show off my wife/kids to social media. You don't know who's watching.
Forever spending my life refusing to be anything below the best.
I've been waiting so long for this.
I'm ACTUALLY working on a short little skate clip for my YouTube channel.

And you're left there feeling helpless and crappy? Yeah it's not nice.
You know when someone you really care about is unhappy and despite your best efforts to make them smile, they just aren't enough?
@MARJBARS I personally don't tbh

For a blind man, he absolutely shreds.
All he can see is an amount colour and light. He skates entirely from feel and memory.

@AzzyB_ <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> okay doesn't matter we're still cool haha
@AzzyB_ if you're talking about my tweet, well they actually don't. They voted for it because they wanted it, so why are they complaining?
If you voted for Conservatives, you have no right to complain when they start charging you shitloads for minor things. You stupid fucks.

Cameron: nah, not until you pay your fees 
@Hotstepper__ that book has got me spun wtf

Prepare yourselves for the evils of a PURE Tory government. 
Does anyone else re-read conversations with someone that makes you smile when you're bored and unable to sleep, because I do
@EMAILSB that's actually so true. Whenever someone approaches me I get really humbled, I get so surprised that I'm worth their time haha
@marquestrevon_ add these:
Stray - When It Rains

And thank you for liking my shots man!

@aksaa_96 please don't ever let yourself do that <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@marquestrevon_ I never see you up at this hour though. How comes you're up?!
@marquestrevon_ I'm awake at this time almost every night lol. I sleep at 10-12 and wake up a few hours later, then be unable to sleep

@fkaTricks lucky guy. Hope you're living it live there! Be safe and stay well :)
@EMAILSB if that makes ANY sense. It's kinda stupid looking back but when you can't love yourself that much you get all sorts of crazy ideas
@EMAILSB I didn't feel that worthy of their time. Back then, I felt all people with a good level of physical beauty were in their own class
@Sangue_E_Ossos this makes me smile so much
@fkaTricks OMG NO WAY :O you're so lucky and fortunate!!! Rio must be so beautiful <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I haven't travelled in almost a decade so yeah
@fkaTricks I have a GoPro. Grab a pair of rollerblades, and if you're in London I'll holla when I'm skating central next :)
@kxkarot lemme know when and I'll see what I can do!
Expect a YouTube vlog on how to be more confident soon.
@fkaTricks those days are usually the best. Especially when you're armed with a camera/skateboard. Or both. <NEW MOON WITH FACE>
It's so mad you know. You never realise how far you've come in life until you look back.
So confident, that the assessors even asked me to advise the rest of the group on how to be more confident. I ended up giving a speech lol
Anyways, two days ago I had a human skills assessment for some job training thing I applied for.

I was the most confident guy in the room.
...if some attractive girl either on here or in real life would approach me, I'd start panicking and hyperventilating lol.
It was so bad to the extent where I didn't even feel worthy to speak to some people that were known to be attractive. Like imagine...
I found it difficult to approach people. Talk to them. Look at them even. I constantly felt like everyone was better than me.
So basically a few years ago I used to so insecure and unconfident (no idea if that's a word). I would be terrified of almost everything.
I really want to tell a little success story I went through but I feel like nobody will read it lol
@kxkarot so make those hours count.
@kxkarot try. You might surprise yourself. It sounds doable.
Helios - Every Hair On Your Head is my most played song on my iTunes. YouTube it, you'll see why.
Me: God, watching you thot the night away lurking for nudes. Go to sleep.
You know when you're drinking warm milk and the cream goes in your mouth unexpectedly and you have a choking fit?

This isn't my night lol
@crxptxc oh my God. It's Saturday?!?!? I didn't even realise LOOOOOOOOOL.

STILL it doesn't mean you can mess it up, look at the state of me
I feel climbing on rooftops and watching my city live and breathe.

I've no idea why but I know that doing that will make me feel so alive.
@crxptxc I know lol. BUT WHY AREN'T YOU ASLEEP.

Fs you're an actual hypocrite you know <UNAMUSED FACE>
@crxptxc cheerio.
@crxptxc but yeah when I try go to bed can you do me a favour and stay off my mind please, it's hard to sleep with you living on there
@crxptxc I'm making myself some warm milk whilst playing the sleepliest music I have on my iPod right now lol
@crxptxc it took me so long to think of a reply to this lol, that's how you know my sleep is an issue :/
@crxptxc It's not that easy. :(

@shamilaa93 get rid of them then.
@RealFurks also look on REED too
@RealFurks there's things like Udemy which hosts free/paid online lectures for various stuff, you could check that out
@RealFurks you can get yourself doing a few specialised courses online or something
@crxptxc @MaskedFlacko @jsfx4 it's okay, you can come with me <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

Oh God. 
@msahmedxo but from what I've read they back Labour on a lot of things so if it's either Labour or SNP I won't be too fussed lol.
@msahmedxo I'm not gonna say I want them to win but that's because I genuinely don't know what they're for (my political knowledge is shit)
@msahmedxo Congrats to you and your country lol, you're killing it up there <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@SafunaM not from what I can see 
@SafunaM Nope that just the forecast! Looking at the BBC it appears that Labour is leading arm
SNP are really going for it and making it happen. Wish I knew their prospectus a bit better.

@steezeldn oh lol. He never spoke of you, and we don't talk anymore.
It's stupid how I can Bigspin Late Flip but not Bigspin.

WHY?! Why can I never do simple tricks?
@steezeldn Not sure which Imran you're referring to tbh
@steezeldn Yeah, I don't. Hence the confusion. Had no idea you skated.
@steezeldn Ouch. Bit too soon for sarcasm :(

You were retweeted on my TL.
@steezeldn You said you didn't skate? It's 5am. My brain is mush. Don't mess with my head please.
@steezeldn It's basically making a trick look REALLY easy to do, popped high, caught high, roll away clean. Like you understand me but mahoo
@steezeldn Graffiti and skating are unrelated lol.

I'm dead serious though. Steeze is a thing in skating. Really weird to define though
@steezeldn HAHAHAHA YES! That brat does my head in honestly.

Unrelated note, your @ has the word 'steeze' in it. Very popular skate term!
@steezeldn LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
@javedkhvn Yes they are, doesn't mean we can be too. Have faith in your abilities man, you're capable of anything.
@javedkhvn "As long as you put God first, He will take care of you."

Someone a friend said to me once. Stuck with me ever since.
@javedkhvn Seriously, people like you and I need to set examples. And we will. Just be hopeful and optimistic, and leave the rest to Allah.
@javedkhvn I'm gonna be honest it's actually so comforting to have finally found another guy that thinks like this.
@javedkhvn Insh'Allah! :D We're capable of anything, we should also start supporting each other too lol
@javedkhvn So let's work hard to develop ourselves into great men that can set examples to these lost males. We've got this.

@emailsb OKAAAAAAAY there's being challenging then there's being unreasonable -_-

@IbbyArsh what does that even have to do with anything? Their deaths were unexpected, that's my point.
I still can't believe that Robin Williams, that guy from Glee, and Paul Walker are dead you know.
@nazifaanjum_ Meh, don't worry about it. It wasn't important anyway. Still, get it checked tomorrow!
@nazifaanjum_ No wonder it didn't ring earlier.

For anyone that's curious, the song is David Lynch - Good Day Today (Hiatus Remix).
In fact, they shouldn't be able to talk at all.
People who say the 'n-word' or 'paki' etc and make shitty excuses to justify it do my head in.
Why is it so difficult for people to understand that OFFENSIVE TERMS/SLURS WILL ALWAYS BE OFFENSIVE
Imagine I had this one song in my iTunes for 3 years which I kept skipping. I listened to it properly today and it's INCREDIBLE.
He's right to be honest.


@mylasiddique Mash'Allah. :) Thank you Myla!
@mylasiddique It's not everyday you find a wavelength that you can resonate to.
@emailsb Besides, people are unreliable too. Expecting people to say hi first can lead to serious disappointment lol
@emailsb If you're super high class, you'd talk to whoever you want, whenever you want, without giving a fuck on who talks first.
@emailsb See to me, that's pride… and pride is one of the seven deadly sins.
I'm so used to my efforts not paying off that when they do, I refuse to believe that it happened. It feels unreal.
@emailsb But why? Why NOT talk first? Think about all the things you could miss out on?
Apparently web designers can earn up to £180,000 per annum!
Looks like the flavouring rolled up into a ball. It happened to me once. Eating it was a huge mistake.

Took this picture earlier this evening. 
@WomanizingNerd thanks man! I got really lucky. Didn't have a tripod but the ledge did just fine!
@WomanizingNerd yaaaaay <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> nah but still this is actually insane

It's soooooooo awkward when your "good morning" message gets aired. :(
@HENDRIXNASH AYYYYYYYY congrats man! So proud of you!
Nah for real if I love you you'll get the great 'good morning' messages ever.
@MoroccanIraqi @Abbvs_ <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> perfect
@Abbvs_ @MoroccanIraqi LMAO IMAGINE "Good morning sunshi-" 'STFU FAISAL GO FUCK YOURSELF'
@MoroccanIraqi I guess so... Still, I gotta be original and unpredictable!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 
Trying to think of a nice message for someone to wake up to in the morning is stress sometimes you know. I really don't wanna repeat myself.
I reeeeaaaaaallly wanna learn how to body pop/robot dance. It looks SOOOOOOOO SICK
@EMAILSB just saw this now. You're pissed. Hang in there! You'll be travelling and outta there soon!
Some of these "dresses" these celebs wear look ridiculous tbh.
Fun fact: if your birth mother's name is 'Chelsea', you're a TV show… because you were Made In Chelsea.
@emailsb Likewise man, this has been a great discussion! I'll speak to you soon, have a blessed evening :)

…assuming you're in the UK
@emailsb That's absolute perfect. Sounds like you've got some great ambitions. Keep them alive! They'll take you far. :)
@emailsb And hell, the people on the internet is still a percentage of the global population. Makes you wonder, what does the other % do?
@emailsb …so we can learn and discover different lifestyles and cultures for ourselves. We can't judge humanity solely through people online
@emailsb Remember, it's a BIG world. There's billions of people. Some better than us, some worse. We are yet to get out there and explore…
@emailsb …pessimistic and choose to do nothing, others - like you &amp; I - can actually try and make something happen as long as we persist.
@emailsb Naaaaaah trust me, there's a lot of people like us. The only setback is that they're going about it the wrong way. Most are…
@emailsb As I am glad to have found you! It's nice to speak to someone with common sense. Don't ever change.
@emailsb We can weep, but we can also wipe our tears away and work on becoming an example for people to follow!
@emailsb Can't lie, I'm trying to be one of them. Trying to get my vlogs around and spread some sense into people, it needs to be done lol
@emailsb It's a free marketing tool in a sense, I don't know. *shrugs*
@emailsb The benefits of social media is that it can SOMETIMES put you in touch with powerful people. It's happened with me a few times
@emailsb spelling isn't a bad thing. I've seen MUCH worse, believe me.
@emailsb You best know when I secure a stable job, I'm travelling and tweeting photography as much as I can hahaha :')
@emailsb Yep! People nowadays take Twitter etc ridiculously serious when there's a huge, beautiful world out there waiting to be explored
@emailsb Majority of guys lack basic respect to women and most of all themselves, and the addition of pointless glory damages that further.
@emailsb …and to add on to that, I also feel that this generation is become a lot more sexualised also. Meaning that's more accessible too.
@emailsb I blame technology. Internet and tech is literally everywhere and it's all so widely accessible. You can do almost anything online…
@_marium_ I was gonna say!!!!!
@og_mokiri HAHAHAHAHAHA intimidation at it's finest!
@hotstepper__ She wins.
@_marium_ LMFAAAAOOOOOO NO WAY!?!?!?!?!?! MARIUM IS THAT YOU????

@og_mokiri MATE. I ACTUALLY CANNOT UNSEE THIS LOOOOOOOOOL
@og_mokiri LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL THIS IS THE MOST SAVAGE THING YOU'VE EVER ASKED ME
@og_mokiri The left one genuinely terrifies me… more than the right one
@EMAILSB the way I see it, if we all start giving and forgiving, the world will improve. But then again, it's just a hopeful theory. :)
@EMAILSB ...differently about certain occasions, just from being our usual, normal selves?
@EMAILSB ...but then, are we actually doing enough to make a difference? I mean, are we opening minds and trying to make people think...
@EMAILSB then again, we need to ask ourselves why we have let humanity come to such a state. We all say "OMG this world is in shambles"...

Rest assured, I'll relish that opportunity to blow your mind.
All I need is someone in power to notice me, and recognise my potential.

All I need is a chance.

“@mariah_amir: 200 MILLION.”

You're kidding. That's the total!?!?!
$138k per second.

Let's just think about that for a bit.
I wanted Pac to win but I guess Mayweather did what he does best. Hats off to him lol
I don't know a thing about boxing, but that fight was pretty intriguing tbh. It sure as hell didn't live up to it's hype though.
That game was a bit... disappointing.
Gosh I wish I knew more about Boxing.
Mayweather looks like the stronger fighter atm. :/
Whoever is playing the tunes in this arena has good taste LOL

I'm so hopeless with my passions.
@bengalibrucelee PRETTY MUCH LOOOOOOOOOOL
@bengalibrucelee You'll be the judge of that tomorrow! Seriously I market myself so much why am I not a marketing executive yet
@thatarabianguy It's 4am you know
You could be INCREDIBLY talented in something, but if you're not pretty, then nobody really cares.

This is the case 80% of the time.
I seriously hope to God this effort I put in pays off because I'm really sick and tired of having my best never being good enough.
My new photoshoot is FINALLY ready.

I've been working on this for an entire month. It even comes with a video!
It's so difficult NOT to talk about my creative ideas that I wanna do on here. This place is littered with idea thieves.
Hai Allah. Can I just find a RED camera on the floor tomorrow please? Please?

Please??? <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
I really want a DSLR that films at a high frame rate. So, so badly. :(

I reeeaaaalllyyyyy wanna film a 5 tricks on flat but I'm sick and tired of featuring only myself on my Channel. I want other skaters on it!
@breezingrain And make it crusty in hours.
@lxxar Awwwww. Oh well, it's kind of a good thing too I guess because you might have motivated them to be healthier, idk
@lxxar Best thing to do is to just say it how it is. It goes for anything really.
@deedeeflora I thought you were talking about giving birth for a second sdobfvsldfbvsfdv I need sleep
Actually, na. Lemme release a book full of my photography and try to compete. (lol)
That's literally all I've got to say about it.
Kim Kardashian is actually releasing a book consisting of her self portraits?

Eeeeeuuuuurrrrrgggggghhhhhhh.
@ZakerAlii trussssssssst me. Like pls just focus on yourself
@zakeralii I just argued with someone saying that earlier lmao
@superherofeed You found it a bit off too?
It's great, but you need to watch it a few times so you can understand what actually happens in it. Too much happening!
Yeah, I finally watched Age of Ultron. I can't lie, the film confused me a bit at the start.
@nimramalik Goodnight Nimra :)
@nimramalik Keeno - Nocturne. I think you'll like that one.

You listen to Drum &amp; Bass. I'm proud of you Nimra, and like you more now.

@yaszizix But it's still dying at YOUR own will. Meh, I don't know.
@yaszizix Yeah. That sounds like suffering to me. Only problem is that it's suicide, therefore haram.
@thedailydoody @_shlx D'aaawww :( never mind then
@thedailydoody @_shlx Think about it.
@_shlx @thedailydoody So this is what an argument between Kylie Jenner and Bruce Jenner would look like
@thatarabianguy I think it's because I speak as someone that's desperate for an audience. I'm on here to promote my works lol
@thatarabianguy No. Keep it.
@azzyb_ @ibnnaeeem @yarsinhoque Let's play frisbee with a stale roti!
@shak__1 Lololol, yep! They'll be reckless, say "Only God can judge me!" and then they die and face judgement.

Which won't be pretty.
@yarsinhoque @ibnnaeeem LMFAAAAOOO LIKE THAT MAKES IT ANY BETTER <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> you're so ironic it's adorable! But you hurt my brain cells. Goodnight.
@shak__1 That's way too far.
@yarsinhoque @ibnnaeeem Says the girl who publicly shames Muslims. That's not rude or mean at all! Noooooooo. Of course not.
@bilkisakhter @yarsinhoque It's actually MORE sad than the people they're criticising to be honest with you.
@yarsinhoque @ibnnaeeem Who said anything about forcing? I'm talking about encouragement.

Hell, I bet you haven't even tried.
@yarsinhoque @ibnnaeeem Yeah, but my point is, why don't you try and do something about it instead of shaming them and saying it's sad?
@yarsinhoque @ibnnaeeem Saying that it's sad IS a criticism.
@marwa236 You mean the Ralph Lauren logo?
@shak__1 purely because people interested in skating gets me happy lol, the more the merrier. But then that's just me hahaha
@shak__1 I don't know man. If someone was really interested in skateboarding and made commentary about it I'd try correct them lol
@yarsinhoque @ibnnaeeem So encourage them to pray more then instead of criticising them lol, after all they're your siblings in Islam.
@farazzz_ Rad, thanks man!
LOL IS THIS A JOB APPLICATION? Shut your face, idiot.
Absolute stupid logic you know. Apparently you can't watch a boxing match unless you've had 5 years experience watching it beforehand???
"Urrrgghhhh can all of you fake fans shut up about Boxing like you all know about it"

LMAO SHUT UP THERE'S HYPE ABOUT IT SO I'M INTERESTED.
Wait so when's this fight happening? 5am?
@nabeel_7_ Don't be one of those guys.
@sangue_e_ossos Actually come to think of it. He does look a little scared.
@sangue_e_ossos Hmm. He does look quite full of himself I have to say. Hope he loses haha
@sangue_e_ossos I can't comment, I don't know a damn thing about Boxing
Hahaha. 
May weather looks so full of himself. Ugh. #MayweatherPacquiao

@gomugirl Did you hear him open up about it on Howard Stern's radio show?
@shahlzz Goodnight Shahlaa.

@og_mokiri Yeah, exactly. I NEVER skate on the road unless I'm skating local. They're always empty haha
@thesaucyfucker They have faaaaaaaaaar too much confidence lol
Since my dad and brother had an accident on one, that settled my opinion on it. Fuck cycling. Skateboarding is the way forward.
I never liked cycling. Yeah it's healthy and stuff but I found it to be more a nuisance.
Cyclists need to learn that they don't own the road.
@nidargael @ashrouen Same here. I just like to imagine that Cyclist twitter have serious saddle sore when they go riding.

@marwa236 You proved yourself a worthy opponent. Until next time, Marwa.

@marwa236 that was the most mind-bending conversation I've had on here for a while. Thanks for that LOL

@marwa236 May day! May day!
@tezlav Very true. I'm just hopeful tbh
@deadpixe1 If you really wanted it, you'd do anything and everything it takes to make it happen.
My life is basically me trying my best and it's not good enough. It never is lol. Lord knows why I still try.

I spoke to this skateboarder in a skateshop the other day and I JUST found out that he rides for Almost sdlbvnsldfbvnsdlfjbnv

@zxinxxb How could you never tell me that you were a fan?!?!?! I'm proper offended. Lemme WhatsApp you album names.
@zxinxxb I have over 2,100 songs of the genre in my iTunes :))))

@OG_MOKIRI not from what I've experienced
If you're a guy and you still send 'xxxx' to girls in an attempt to flirt you just insanely cringey
@kiranjohal55 It's so cringe.
@deedeeflora Your emotions are what make you human. It's how you cope with them that determines you
New header.
@vxshy It's just getting yourself started that's the stressful part. But still, good luck with whatever your endeavours are.
@vxshy It depends on what you aspire to be, career-wise. If you damn good at what you do, finances won't be a problem.
I should probably put in my bio that I'm a YouTuber now.
@vxshy You could aspire to be way more than rich.
I mean come on. 
Looks like the daughter of Raven from CBBC. 
Johann Pachelbel - Canon in D. Masterpiece.
@edozollo Let's try and shoot soon :)
@edozollo Ahhhh Ed you are far too kind man, thank you so, so much! Really appreciate the support. Hope you've been keeping well!
@breezingrain I've never seen One Piece man
I feel like giving myself a shoot tonight. I mean why not?
First Instagram feature of 2015. Hopefully not the last either. 
Music that so bassy that it makes your headphones vibrate and tickles your ears.

That's my favourite kind of music.
@adilsaperture I'm too broke man :(
I. Need. A. Slider.

ASAP.
Robert Downey Jr. has opened up about walking out on the Channel 4 News interview with Howard Stern: 
@Marwa236 understandable. I have 20/20 vision so I wouldn't know.
@Marwa236 wait. What?!?
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL 
@Marwa236 that's understandable. I don't suit spectacles sadly.
@YouLemonade oh yeah definitely, I was wondering what happened to the franchise. It looks promising! I can't wait :')
@Marwa236 meeehhhh. You could probably read someone's mind with them. It's still no big deal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Marwa236 hahaha, no seriously! They suit your face. :)
@Marwa236 nice specs.
Fantastic Four looks... intense. I kinda like the cast in the older films more, but I guess I'll have to wait until the film is out.
@laeezus HAHAHAHAHAHA people are so stupid
@rollingdrone It's literally everything for me hahaha, I'm making this the soundtrack to my skate park if I ever make one, I don't care haha
I love the Drum and Bass community. 
If you're happy with your body the way it is then good on you lol
I can kinda see why people are irritated at that beach body advert, but it's aimed at women who WANT to train and get the body they want.
If u understand

MOTHER LOVE 
It blows my mind how beautiful people can be. Both aesthetically and in character.
Reading up on things. (Z2)

Had a little shoot with @th0rin and @goldavies87 last night... was great fun exploring new sights in… 
Why is this person on my Facebook making statuses about her workout like we all even care
@shreddyxkrooger Good luck dude! Hope it goes well. :)
@rollingdrone Kimyan Law's releasing a new EP soon. One of the excerpts… 

I'm in so much love with this man.
@kthanksbye__ ayyyyyyyy, high five. Thank you, you have a lovelier one!
@kthanksbye__ Did you?
@kthanksbye__ I have. I had an early night. :D
@kthanksbye__ it's so difficult and stressful isn't it :(
@rahmanitsemz Aameen, bro, and you also!
@rahmanitsemz Nah man, I'm fully aware lol. Last year was awful for me. This year I'm bring it back around and taking it FULLY serious.
@rahmanitsemz That's actually so sick <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> You lucky man! Mash'Allah
@rahmanitsemz Insh'Allah! Hopefully better than last year. I might deactivate for the entire month just to fix myself up for it
That'll also be cool. And live too. :'D
Like yeah, it's cool fasting with family but imagine living with a group of friends and you're all fasting/praying together.
Imagine doing Ramadan with a bunch of friends. That'd be so cool you know.
@rahmanitsemz Ramadan vibes. &lt;3
When you make a cup of tea SOOOOOOOOOOO damn good that you have to make effort not to moan sexually
Good morning to everyone that reads this. Hope you're blessed with a wonderful day today.
To actually WAKE UP for Fajr instead of staying up all night for it feels waaaaaaaaaay better.
Just watched Vice. What a lame film.
@SHAK__1 because he tweeted offensive shit and I found it annoying.
Tony.  
@SHAK__1 nice shot man :)
Kids are having sex at 10-12 years old? Wow that's disturbing af.
My nipples could cut tiles right now. Wearing one layer for a night shoot was definitely not a good idea.
It's amazing what you can see when you keep your head up. (Z2)

It's amazing what you can see when you keep your head up. A huge thank you to everyone for all of… 
@ShreddyxKrooger no idea
This guy sat next to me smells so fucking bad. Urgh.

HOW CAN YOU NOT HAVE GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE?!
@TezlaV yep, definitely!
My local skate shop already has a photographer <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@thebowman No worries, and thank you for the feature.

This has given me the chills.

Disappointments. Disappointments, everywhere.
@realfurks @Abbvs_
@Marwa236 Take a look at @deray's Tweet: 
@HeyHoItsMoMo you acknowledged what I said. That's enough for me. You're welcome.
@ahmed_shak_ LOL yeah! only saw about two people talk about it on my TL, kinda calm
@heyhoitsmomo I deleted it years ago. Long story short, what I said was meant to be a confidence booster. You're a great-looking guy, nohomo
@heyhoitsmomo You got more notes for your face that I got for every single photography picture I put on my Tumblr back when I had it
@levelelite This is EXACTLY what I'm fearing for right now. :( sorry to hear that man
*leave a message that takes you ages to well up the confidence to say to her*

*avoid phone for 50 years*
@womanizingnerd Who who? Who who?
Whoooooooooo are you?
Who who? Who who?
But from the sounds of it, whoever made that vine is an incredible pervert. What a freak.
You know you're following the right people and have blocked all the wrong people when you can't see a vine that people are angry over.

I'm sorry whoever you are im sorry <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@a_xciv But on a note. You're one of the few guys I actually respect and look up to on here. You can do anything, seriously.
@a_xciv Sorry man :( here, change of topic. You might like this track. I found myself falling in love again haha: 
@a_xciv …or you're just THAT clueless on what to do with your life next. Insecurities, confidence levels, they're both a pain in the ass.
@a_xciv Or worse, when you have no choice BUT to knowingly waste time because you either feel you're incapable of doing anything…
@a_xciv And when you look at it in that aspect, it's a little scary isn't it? So much power, in your own two hands.
@a_xciv but essentially, the future is unpredictable. We don't know what'll happen. It's down to us to shape and determine it.
@a_xciv Definitely. I know for a fact that in ten years time, I will look back at today wishing I have that much free time then…
@a_xciv Yeah. It'll be similar, but it can go both ways. Could be likable or horrendous. Reeaaaallly unpredictable, but I guess that's life!
@fxmizzle Tell him he's my hero pls
@a_xciv Always man… but it's just sad  that there are people in this world that can't see past those things and miss out on such beauty.
@fxmizzle LMFAOOOOOOO NO WAY
@a_xciv Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, James Brown… it goes on hahaha
@a_xciv Yeah! It's such a rarity nowadays. This generation is tooooooooo sexualised and I fucking hate it. There's more to life than sex.
@a_xciv in terms of what happened during that era and whatnot. But for now… doesn't seem like a bad place to vanish to
@a_xciv Romance was way more alive back then. Plus the music and everything then was incredible too. BUT, I do need to learn more about it
If it wasn't for the racism, I'd be trying to build a time machine back to the 50s every single day lol.
Forests &amp; moonlight.
@toyken Still, thank you so much! Really humbled that you think so :)
@toyken You really don't like the shot? Hahaha, damn. I freaking love it personally, Von Wong's photography is so incredible
@toyken works both ways. <SMIRKING FACE>
@toyken so does your weave xo
@mo_sudani Some is blatantly unreal, some is totally legit. I've done plenty of both, and it's equally as fun.
@mo_sudani Well yeah… that's basically taking photography to an artistic form. There's various different kinds of photography lmao
@mo_sudani you do know that literally makes no sense whatsoever right?
THIS WAS TAKEN WITH A PHONE.

A PHOOOOOOONNNNNNEEEEEE.

P H O N E !

Pic Cred: Benjamin Von Wong

- 
@kuntakutiking Mhmm. It beats every photo I've ever taken. Total pisstake. :(
If you want to see his entire shoot, you can see it here: 

He used a Huawei P8.
So Benjamin Von Wong done a photoshoot entirely with a smartphone and these were some of the shots he got: 
Lay low. Practice. Train. Learn. Then rise from the ashes and blow everyone's minds out of proportion. Every, single, day.
My time to do great things will happen. It's just not happening now. And I've finally accepted that.
I can only show you instead… which will take time lol.
I can't tell you how much I love emotional, drum-less soundtracks.
@marwa236 I will do when I'm there next time… if I remember where it is.
@marwa236 Wow. First your ends, now your grandmother's ends. I'm basically unintentionally stalking you &amp; your family. Sorry about that.
@r_uhi Hahaha, yeah the area was pretty eerie when I shot it. It was quite dark too, but this particular picture was overexposed &gt;_&lt;

Just watched a camera review between the Nikon D5500 and the Sony a6000 The Gadget Show.

Nikon D5500 - 4G's.
Sony a6000 - 4.5G's.
My friend got pizza from Dominoes today, when he opened the box he said "HARAM" because it had pepperoni on it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> couldn't stop laughing

@theomaramo LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL THE QUESTIONS. You sir are accurate and brilliant!
@LadyNonchalance that makes two of us :)
@heyhoitsmomo Yep!
This world needs unity. So, so badly.
@ibnnaeeem Congrats! You're a man.
@thatarabianguy @mylasiddique Probably wants to take 'sweet ass' to a next level
@mylasiddique @thatarabianguy Euthanasia is illegal you know.
@thatarabianguy @mylasiddique And Isam just explained why you're heartless before I could even ask the question
@mylasiddique @thatarabianguy yeah, and you give everyone diabetes in the process, leaving them unable to enjoy sugary foods any more.
@thatarabianguy Hahaha, yeah I was kidding anyway. Mubarak to them ^_^
@heyhoitsmomo It's basically a screw inside the skateboard truck that holds the entire thing together
@thatarabianguy Darn. I bet he probably puts milk in his tea before the hot water, the cheeky scumbag -_-
@mylasiddique @thatarabianguy Myla, you a terrible liar. #barz
@thatarabianguy I swear to God if you didn't ask for her hand in marriage I will be so disappointed in you LOOOOL
@thatarabianguy You talk to some shit girls man
@ashrouen omg you're********
@ashrouen You must be a banker, 'cause your Nationwideeeeeee
@thatarabianguy I'm more fascinated by that kid who appears to be doing a sharp turn on his bike LOL
You find a girl pretty? Tell her she's pretty straight up. Don't beat around the bush.
In my world, being romantic and open with your feelings (under that limit) makes you more manlier than that "alpha-male" bullshit.
@HeyHoItsMoMo LOL, I'd tell you what a Kingpin but it's hard to explain over twitter
And you know what? I'm freaking proud of it. Romance for the win. It's too beautiful to die.
I'm literally sat here day dreaming about myself slow dancing with my imaginary wife whilst I listen to Frank Sinatra.
@HeyHoItsMoMo that's a name of a skateboard component you know loooool
I've gotta crushhhhh, on youuuuuu… sweeeeetieee pieeeeeeeee.
@mylasiddique Hey, that nickname was a favour for you. You brought that upon yourself.

Wonderbra.
@mylasiddique Man. I really need to stop pointing out stuff that can't be unseen
@mylasiddique his hair in his album art looks like it's been coloured in with a Sharpie
@BreezingRain whoever plays him in the series does a fantastic job, brilliant actor
Wilson Fisk. What an unthreatening name.
People that act like they know EVERYTHING in things they haven't even tried out are h i l a r i o u s .
@mo_sudani @alimacpali I've had him blocked since last year lmao
@mylasiddique @mo_sudani Cheers, yeah he's an ignorant idiot because photography is way more than "pressing a button" lololololol
@Mo_Sudani ??
@alishafxyz I'll keep an eye out for you when I watch it next hahaha :)
@alishafxyz NO WAY YOU WATCH THE LAST LEG, I LOVE THAT SHOW
@alishafxyz HAHAHAHAHA thank you! I can't wait :')
@alishafxYZ yep, it is! I live for bad/silly jokes :')

My mums watching an Indian drama and there's a character called "Ishita". I hope her surname is 'Brick'.

@Ruby_Malaika hm. I thought it was really drained of colour in comparison to yours. But yeah, that's why I've stopped using white borders
I guess he can cross that off the bucket list 
@ruby_malaika It looks so much better than mine
Can you girls NOT snapchat your food in your story for once? Seriously I'd only care about your food if you're sharing it
@ToyKen yep! But not everyone is able to say that, that's the thing :/
I need a bigger skateboarding audience you know.
@ladynonchalance Very true. :)
@ladynonchalance It's a selfish world. :/
Why CAN'T people be happy for others?
Hmm. 
I mean you must be insanely bored to want to get locked in a room for an hour lol
This actually looks fun, but it's also surprising that they make it into an actual thing. 
I need a camera that films at a really high frame rate. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

Only in Canada does "Milk bags" have two different meanings. #Ifyouknowwhatimean <NEW MOON WITH FACE><NEW MOON WITH FACE><NEW MOON WITH FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
Nah I can't imagine using milk in bags. Bottles for life. &gt;&gt;&gt;
@_anamerz I just facepalmed so hard
@nemosayy they don't :( stalk my tweets, I retweeted a pic
1.Grab it
2.Put it in the pitcher 
3.Cut the corners 
4.Pour your milk 
5.dispose…
@nemosayy no, they get it in actual bags
@Nabeel_7_ @ta_ma_nuhh tempted to go to Canada purely to attempt the milk bag lifestyle, it sounds so interesting LOOOOOL
Have like carrier bags full of milk or something.

I've not slept for two nights leave me alone. I know I'm sounding stupid rn.
When I first read that Canadians get their milk in bags I legit thought they had like public milk taps and you put carrier bags under them
@ta_ma_nuhh @Nabeel_7_ I just never knew Canadians keep milk in bags hahahaha it's just a unique concept to me lol
@ta_ma_nuhh @Nabeel_7_ I haven't slept in two days my brain is literally mush so I apologise if I seem dopey. I'll take your word for it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ta_ma_nuhh @Nabeel_7_ that is so strange :( milk in a bag just sounds so fiddly and messy
@SilenceFoo the rhythm is just THAT great hahahaha
@SilenceFoo Sara From The Block. Kinda works. I can't wait to skate to it when I'm next at the skatepark though OH MY LIFEEEEEE
@laeezus LOL, no don't it's okay, lots of people miss it &gt;.&lt;
J-Lo - Jenny From The Block is stuck in my head. It's so catchy dammit.
There was fox screeching like mad last night. It was hella noisy. I think it was wrestling with a kitten.
@laeezus faisaltreshah <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@laeezus it's nice to take photos around though. My Instagram is proof of that hahaha <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@laeezus London isn't all that. Everything here is expensive and almost all the people here are grumpy, rude and horrible looool
@laeezus WHAT EVEN THAT'S SO COOL. I'm a Pakistani born in London, UK, I feel so boring loooool :(
@OG_MOKIRI deal
@OG_MOKIRI HEADPHONES MAN, OR PUT IT ON SUPER LOW VOLUME
@OG_MOKIRI check your whatsapp
@OG_MOKIRI my eye for detail is insane, I can't help it loooooooool #JustPhotographyThings
@OG_MOKIRI you need to read your tweet reeeeaaaaaally carefully, when you see it, you'll laugh as crazy as I am right now.<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
It's why I always smile when I hear them chirp at this time looooool
My mum told me once that the reason you hear birds chirping early in the morning is because they're making their morning prayers to Allah.
@laeezus It's 4:57am!
@laeezus Hold on. You're not from UK?!?!?!?! Bloody hell this whole time I thought you were British :(
The girl in my last RT is actually attractive. But she's wasted so many Doritos so no.
@crissycakesss Way to make 'sick and tired' an attractive look
@laeezus Good morning. I haven't slept yet. Hope you have a wonderful day.
@shubnaa HEEEEEYYYYY, I need your opinion lol
@shubnaa oh
@ashrouen HAHAHAHAHA that makes two of us :') I love puns so much
@ashrouen Imagine that someone got defensive and shouted at people laughing at them…

Perfect chance to shout "Don't be cocky!" at them lool
Anyone else???
I've just finished editing a shoot and I'm stuck choosing between two pictures. Anyone wanna help me out? Fave this.
@artfuliy @mamamanvz
Remember kids. "Rapping" and "Raping" are two VERY different things. Know your spellings.
@kamillabuz LOOOOOOOOL ah terrorising :') good old days. Check the story I just tweeted lol
At the end of the lesson he collected the worksheets and started cracking up with laughter because he wrote down 'The Raping Rabbis' instead
…so we did, and one group called themselves 'The Rapping Rabbis' with so much happiness and pride. Wrote it on the worksheet &amp; everything.
My RE lessons back in GCSEs were the funniest. Imagine we had to put ourselves into groups and give ourselves group names…
@kamillabuz I know! :') Our RE teacher was a dude btw hahaha, he is such a G
@KamilLabuz I slyly miss GCSEs
@KamilLabuz imagine my whole entire RE class randomly broke out into singing that song one lesson. Even the teacher joined in LOOOOOOOL
@kamillabuz Sorry man I'm in a wacky mood. Thank you LOL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@kamillabuz THERE WILL BE NO WHITE FLAG ABOVE MY DOOR,
I'M IN LOVE, AND ALWAYS, WILLLLLL BEEEEE
@thugrid You're so lucky! I live too far away from there :(
@thugrid *sigh* you felt right. This is a really funky remix of a classic, I love it. Thought you would too: 
@kamillabuz You best accept me, else you're gonna break my heart
@thugrid I'll check this out once I've finished filming for my vlog for sure man! Thank you so much! D'you like electrofunk?
My taste in music is the greatest. Idc.
@zxinxxb Hahahaha it'll probably annoy her eventually, I'm that bad
@thugrid OMG YES! FINALLY AN ASIAN GUY THAT APPRECIATES THIS LEGEND! Telling you this now, those kinda feelings are the best. Hold onto 'em!
@saniaahsan I'VE SEEN YOUR STORIES DON'T GO INTO DENIAL
@zxinxxb She better. I'm gonna smother her with so much cute shit like you wouldn't believe LOOOOOOOOOL
@saniaahsan Looooool everyone would be rubbing your head, trying to get your creative textile magic
@zxinxxb Purely because I can see myself waltzing to this with my wife when the time comes looooool
@zxinxxb I got his Ultimate Sinatra: The Centennial Collection today. Been smiling since. ^__^
And afterwards we drop into a quiet place and have a drink or 2,
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid like I love you.
@saniaahsan Go bald and be the asian Amber Rose
I fucking love Frank Sinatra's music. Oh my giddy giddy gosh.
@xenarthran_ If all the mind-numbing, useless cack got removed from the internet then maybe I might like it more. But for now? No.
@xenarthran_ that's why I hate it. But I still use it to promote my work, it's the fastest way and - as I said - part of everyday life.
@xenarthran_ Yeah sure, I learn a fair share of stuff on there but there's way more stupidity and brain-rotting shit on here than sense.
@xenarthran_ …you've never met before then that's taking the internet too seriously. It is NEVER that serious.
@xenarthran_ And thus, when you give opinions, you get all three of those treatments, maybe more. If you care about opinions from people…
@xenarthran_ This is twitter dude. There's opinions everywhere. Some you take in. Some you ignore. Some you abuse.
@xenarthran_ Looool, unfair? You say that like the internet has got feelings. Why care lol, if you like it then you like it. Good on you.
@xenarthran_ The internet rots your brain. I hate it more than I love it. Yes it's a part of everyday life now but it's still irritating.
It's so sad how people can't accept other people's differences.
@xenarthran_ Ever heard of a book?
@msahmedxo #JustPharmacyThings I'm guessing
@nabeel_7_ @mylasiddique LOOOOOOOOL WHY IS THAT SO FUNNY
“@kunshini: Imagine the government collectively just pulled the plug on the Internet.”

That would be nice.

Shut me …
@annum__ awwww bless you, nah don't feel stupid it's just me being me
This happened about two years ago but it still blows my mind just thinking about it.

God bless skateboarding.
…and that he said to his father "Daddy, one day I'm gonna be just as good as that man out there"
Imagine I was skating once, and this man came up to me and told me that his son watches me skate…
@annum__ Tired. hyper. Tiper. I'm bored so I'm mixing words.
@annum__ ANNUM BE HAVING THE TIPER EFFECT
@_xaakx Yep, hence why I said earlier: 'More money than sense.' I know for sure the instant they lost all attention they'd go back to normal
Celeb culture is just weeeeeiiiiiirrrrrrrdddddddd.
@womanizingnerd Arrrggghhhh it's weird to explain. I mean I still enjoyed it but it wasn't the same feel. B vs R is brilliant though!!!
@_xaakx …getting a sex change and go "I'm a woman".

They're all messed up. I'm seriously wondering why they get so much attention.
@_xaakx They're bullshit reasons to me. If that was my daughter I'd smack some sense into her and give her the love she needs instead of…
@womanizingnerd I can't lie I liked that one the least LOOOOOOL, but they're all really good! You seen the Justice League film with Cyborg?
@_xaakx … actually is, wouldn't you be concerned too? Because I sure as hell would. She should be happy with herself regardless at that age.
@_xaakx Yeah, more money than sense. Ell oh ell.

But seriously, if your daughter was so about faking her body to look more than what it…
@_xaakx She's too young to have that sort of surgery done though. She's still growing. It's gonna mess her up as she grows older.
“@vibegifs: I'd rather be here rn 

I would say that… but I can't swim. So I'd drown and die.
@womanizingnerd Was that the one that looked more anime-esque?
Let's film. <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@womanizingnerd I'm waaaaaaay ahead of you! I've seen quite a few of them hahaha
Just watched 'Son of Batman'… quite an interesting concept.
If any of you lot get stuck on M1, M2, C1, C2, and/or C3, @ me.

Fuck C4.

@thejolade You inspirational guy you. I needed that, thanks man.
When I sat on the bus, some woman next to me tried taking a photo… with the flash on. I was livid.
@og_mokiri I see. I personally need it to be sunny loooool… but yeah, you've been really quiet man. Hope all is well with you
Both, I replied I want you to be you and I want you to tran…

@icreatelife thank you Kristina! Hope you're having fun in Sweden! :)
@Mishm_ if I can prove myself wrong, so can you. Quit making excuses and start working to make a difference.
@Mishm_ you are capable of absolutely anything. If you don't believe me, I got bullied for no reason in my past. Now I've shot for Nike.

laebnvladfvldsfnvslf wow I would rant about Charlie Hebdo but it's not even worth my energy.
@project_assad NO FREAKING WAY.
Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone in Nepal.
What's Charlie Hebdo done now?
Imagine being appreciated mainly for your body and not who you are as a person.

Fuck that.
Want. Need. 
@OG_MOKIRI sounds good, let's make it happen sometime soon

I was wondering why my brother wasn't getting ready for school already. I was about to wake him up, then I remembered it's Saturday LOOOOOL
@ManicPangloss hmmmmmm. Well, the conversation between us on there isn't over. Get back to me when you can please :)
@rollingdrone Ray Charles - Georgia On My Mind.

You will love this.
@manicpangloss This isn't about me is it? Because I did explain everything to you over a couple of voice notes
“@tea4tasnia: Why is romance dead?”

Because this generation over-sexualised it.
People make jokes about Ray Charles but his music is genuinely phenomenal. RIP.

It's SO annoying when you have a song stuck in your head and you have no idea what it is.
@Castrovski_ do it. It's expensive but I promise you won't regret it. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> who knows you might end up being better than me lol
Chris Hadfield. Rodney Mullen. Steve Berra. 
@Castrovski_ this is so random but you'd be so fun to travel with. I guarantee you'll turn into a photographer if it happens lol
@MARJBARS literally. "I can't believe it's not butter!"
@AqibWrites NOOOOOOOOO DON'T I WAS KIDDING

No she hasn't. 
The only thing I'm scared about when it comes to having daughters is the guys that will break her heart.
@GenghisKhaninho @PlayStationUK @PlayStation REPORT DAT SHEEEIT
@shahlzz how can someone even ask you that, that's just insanely rude wtf
@shahlzz I swear I wonder what kind of people you have around you at times
@hdrjbr trust me I've tried. Most I got round to making is trailers. Everything literally has to be perfect, can't be done on your own
@shahlzz @BanesOtherHalf as are you.
@hdrjbr SAME. It's so stressful though!
@BanesOtherHalf @shahlzz God bless you Henna.
Imagine there's people in the world that think your birthday begins the instant you start developing in the womb.
@mylasiddique yeah, when I do skateboard tricks lol
@mylasiddique I look like a woman that's in her 40s, is still sexy, and has a big butt. Men and women both love me. That's a win.
Psychologically it's messed me up so bad and nobody realises how harmful it can actually be to a person.
I reeeeaaaaaally want to visit loads of schools and give talks about the harms and dangers of bullying.
@mylasiddique what I said isn't exactly a bad thing...
@mylasiddique HAHAHAHAHAHA CAN'T BE UNSEEN
@GenghisKhaninho you drama queen. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@mylasiddique I thought this was a male Selena Gomez <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@shahlzz *hugs*
@GenghisKhaninho that must've sounded waaaaaaaaaay less dramatic in your head lol
@GenghisKhaninho I'm just scared this will be permanent tbh.
The SPEED in which they U-turn and go "it's not my priority why you telling me to do it?!?"

Lol then why are you telling me how to do it?
Nah seriously almost all asians just love to sit there criticise EVERY DAMN THING you do like OKAAAAY THEN EXPERT SHOW ME HOW IT'S DONE
Jobs, studies, careers, basically every single freaking thing you do.

It's fucking irritating.  
"@HennaaaShah Sisqo - Thong Song

Childhood song <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH COLD SWEAT> 
 

HOW DID I IMAGINE HIM MAKING THIS SONG 
Not everyday swallow your anger, sometimes SPIT IT IN THEIR FACES BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT
I haven't been feeling like myself the last few weeks. I used to be so full of love but lately I just feel like being nasty to almost anyone
@GenghisKhaninho lmfao no they don't tbh. I'm just 'there' idk
People are actually noticing me on Twitter for once.

This is nice.

 
@GenghisKhaninho you best know that as the proud man that I am, I wouldn't appreciate it AT AAAAAAALLLLL. I AM NOT HER FATHER.
@HennaaaShah YOU, are incredible, and have lifted my mood. Mad love my fellow Shah <PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART><PURPLE HEART>
@HennaaaShah YOU FOUND IT
@GenghisKhaninho exactly! I get so weirded out like "you really gonna think of your dad when you're getting rammed from behind, oookay then"
I still don't get how a woman can call her man "daddy" tbh.
@HennaaaShah trust. I hate everything right now loooool
Really? I'm gonna be waking up NOW? REALLY????
If there's one thing I'll miss about winter, it's being able to keep my phone up my sleeve instead of in my pockets.

@HENDRIXNASH STRESS
Then we ended up having a chat about skating and how he used to enter competitions. Apparently he did a Nollie Heel over a pyramid. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Instead he asked me if he could have a go on my board and cruised around, popping a few ollies here and there. O_o
I remember this one cop saw me skating and came to approach me. I got so scared thinking that he was gonna arrest me.
Police officers that are cool are actually so, so rare.

I care about people so much and I hate it. That's my hugest downfall. I care so much that it hurts.
@_anamerz everyone that's doing this challenge is making themselves look ridiculously stupid tbh, I hate these trends so much
@hxnadrgn ahhhhhhh that makes more sense. I'll have a peep into it when I can <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@hxnadrgn I've not seen that before <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@superherofeed I'd say that's (Marvel)lous
They see what you show, and what you show is what you will be known for.
If you have to rely on your body to get someone to be interested in you, your chances of making that into a successful relationship is slim.
"I'M SCREAMING" - wrote the tweeter with the most expressionless face in the history of their life.
@ashrouen You legend, thank you man
You don't pull people out of the darkness. Instead, you shine a light in where they are trapped.
@ashrouen How d'you delete your tweets in bulk? I've been wanting to do that for ages

@hibahaqsa Wouldn't be too fussed. Plus you can always come back and say hi whenever you want, my sister does it all the time lol
@hibahaqsa You say that like you know for sure that your husband will be absolutely demented.
I should do more Graphic Design tbh.

My last RT defines me so well. You don't even want to know the kind of thoughts I get.
Adam Hills to be the next Prime Minister. If you don't know who he is, look up his rants on the YouTube channel 'The Last Leg'.
@psychoticlust Just had a peep. It looks good… from what I saw looool
@hdrjbr Oh definitely. Seeing it in real life never tires me out!
@psychoticlust I wanna see!
Doing photography actively has made me so bored of sunset pics. I can't remember the last time I saw a sunset picture that made me go 'woah'
Skateboarding &gt; you.
Idc, I'm brilliant at flatland skating.
Pop shove it late flips.
Bigspin late flips.
Pop shove it late Varials.
360 Underflips.
FS Flips.
Hardflips.

All (re)learnt today.
And it seriously comes in handy for real life situations.

Well, for me anyway lololololol.
As ridiculous as it sounds, both shows taught me how you can know things about people simply from observation.
House MD and Elementary will forever be some of the greatest TV series I've ever watched.
@JayRayFresh as an e-book pdf thingy.
@JayRayFresh however, I do still have a few chapters that I haven't "published" yet. I might just finish writing it and release it...
@JayRayFresh you really think so? Thank you man. I lost the time and will to write tbh, this was done during exam season...
Ignore the Facebook and Tumblr URLs, they're both dead now.
LOL who remembers this floppery of a project that I did last year? 
Imagine Flash and Spiderman teaming up to defeat Ganondorf???
DC Comics, Marvel, Zelda. 
More of this please.

@Na_azM I applied in the Westfields in Shepherd's Bush
@na_azm No way, that's awesome!
Applied for a job at LEGO. Hahaha, imagine how cool it would be to work there.
@Sangue_E_Ossos @Nabeel_7_ true. Thanks for the reminder.
@hxnadrgn common sense is a myth these days. Dammit. I need to vlog about this
@hxnadrgn I just saw LOOOOOOOL great minds think alike :') bless your common sense.
@Nabeel_7_ I feel you man. Times are hard loooool
@hxnadrgn idc those kinda stuff are better kept to yourselves, not everything you do needs to be public
@hxnadrgn I feel that some of them fake it to troll, be "funny" (lol), or be irritating as hell (more accurate)
@Nabeel_7_ why d'you think I'm barely tweeting these days looooool I can't be bothered anymore
@Nabeel_7_ dude, pull your head out of it. Not worth damaging your brain cells. Block them people like you mean it
Retweet this if you have common sense.
@Nabeel_7_ ??? They ever heard of actions having consequences??? Like people don't bring things upon themselves???

??????
Literally cannot be bothered with people who take Twitter too seriously.
@Nabeel_7_ oh her LOL. I don't even feel sorry tbh
@Nabeel_7_ I really want to know who this person is

@sighrah_ @Channel4News exactly, there was no need!
@hiyaitssaira A similar instance happened when that cereal cafe opened too. It's actually so ridiculous. Good on RDJ for leaving.
Here's the link if anyone hasn't seen it yet: 
@arjangrewal Who you calling fool? Fool.

Here's the link: 
What the hell were they even thinking???? RDJ was so right to walk out. He was there to promote Age of Ultron, NOT to talk about his past.
YOOOOOOOOO' has anyone seen the interview Robert Downey Jr walked out on with Channel 4?!?!?!
@arjangrewal LMFAAAOOOO TRUST ME
@arjangrewal SUMMER FRUITS IS MY BABY &lt;3 Keep your apple and blackcurrants -_-
@hotstepper__ I didn't know it was built in. Hmmm, I guess we can only hope people who know help others out
@hotstepper__ You can only complain for so long… there's other ways to cope with it, but I guess everyone's got their preferences
@Hotstepper__ actually I didn't. I deactivated everything and got on with my work. Complaining about it is a waste of time.
Instead of complaining about how much revision you've got to do, how about you shut the fuck up and actually revise.
@YouLemonade Harveys
@ModestlyyVainn they'll be there soon I promise

@SilenceFoo once I stood on a weighing scale and it said that I was 60 kilos but I thought it meant stones so I told everyone I'm 60 stones
It's sad that I'm actually compelled to ask this person if they care about me or not.
@DeeDeeFlora eeeeeeeeexactly. Those kind of guys are so humiliating and disgraceful to manhood, running away from a fantastic responsibility
@DeeDeeFlora the people who base a relationship on sex are the worst lol
@BreezingRain <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> so catchy but so filthy

@BengaliBruceLee I can't comment about the comics as I've never read them, defo weird though
@SafunaM LOOOOOOOL "PERIOD MAN TO THE RESCUE!"

He must be insanely thirsty.
Iceman from the X-Men series is/was apparently gay.
@silencefoo Now that you say it, I actually have no idea why I really want to have children.
I reaaaaaally wanna confront this person and tell them the problem I've got with them but I'm terrified of losing them.
@jasmintoes That's awkward. Never mind. :')

@godscheckmate It depends on what you want to do for a career to be honest.
@bintnawaz …I had no idea how good I am at analysing pictures until now. Thanks Naayaab <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@bintnawaz Haha, yeah I got you. The photographer probably used a flash, the reflection (shiny-ness) of their eyes must've caught it
@bintnawaz Taking pictures of the milky way requires a VERY long exposure and no light pollution, they had to be sat really still
@BintNawaz zombie where?!

@haneeensultan This is just what I'm reading about! No idea if it's true yet.
@hennaaashah I can think of worse things :/
@txnvi People are saying that it's part of a new update… I'm so confused right now looool

Everyone's irritating me today.
How do I get this person that's made me angry out of my head so I can go to bed already?
Pride. What an ugly fucking trait.
I seriously hope to God this person's pride isn't so big that it tears apart a fantastic friendship.
I'm actually too annoyed to sleep right now.
For once, it's actually HILARIOUS LOOOOOOL
Discovered a TV Show called 'The Last Leg' where they have three comedians talking about stuff and making fun of it.
@heyhoitsmomo No way. The film literally just finished uploading when you go to bed.
Well. That's motivated me further to be an epic dad when the time comes.
@__mimi_x to some, showing off your body like that isn't self disrespect, and I just can't be bothered with a debate lol

I have only one complaint with Daredevil.

Why does Matt Murdoch - a BLIND guy - use a TOUCHSCREEN phone?!
@Abbvs_ marvellous :')
@mylasiddique thank you Myla! I'll reply to your whatsapp later tonight when things are less hectic and I can give you my full attention
It's actually insane how much Namaaz improves your day. I feel so happy!
@WomanizingNerd perhaps so! Thank you for the comforting words bro &lt;3
@WomanizingNerd very true! But when you see the difference between your kits it's quite eye opening hahaha

@GodsCheckmate ...Otherwise you might be too late. God forbid.
@GodsCheckmate it took me months to get into vlogging myself. Trust me, it's worth it. Don't wait for too long though...
That, is something.
Pavarotti is phenomenal. I know nothing about classical music but this one piece from him alone gives me the chills.
@laeezus good luck with them. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@GodsCheckmate you need to consider vlogging or something. Spread your words to people on a wider scale or something.
@jasvindergrewa1 @mylasiddique @crxptxc yay, this should be fun
@jasvindergrewa1 @mylasiddique @crxptxc Can I join?
Why? Endless inspiration and influence.
I love being better than people. But I love people that are better than me way, way more.
Switching from Pavarotti, to J Cole, to High Contrast, to Hans Zimmer, to Linkin Park, to Miles Davis, to Avenged Sevenfold. And so on.
My iTunes now has Opera music in it. Big up music diversity.

Of course. As long as he signs my divorce papers beforehand :))
@maskedflacko Good luck redeeming yourself.
@maskedflacko @mylasiddique Honestly? Not enough.

All I'm gonna tell you is, every choice you make has it's consequences.
@maskedflacko @mylasiddique Then get off Twitter and start working your arse off instead of wasting time panicking.
If you're in that rare percentage, I guess you're one of the lucky ones.
I've always found that people on Twitter either like you for what you do, or what you look like. It's VERY rare when it's both.
There's so much comfort with hiding my face on here. It's weird to explain.
Now where do I go from here? I can only improvise for so long.

@aimeecharleswth She is beautiful.
Just finished the first season of Daredevil… ahhhhh the second season can't come sooner! Loved the entire thing!
@Sangue_E_Ossos sadly no. I saw one riding around on a penny board near my area though. I was too scared to approach her lol
