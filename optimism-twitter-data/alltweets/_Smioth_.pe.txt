I want a pug ;-;
-when it doesn't happen.
I really hate when people say they want to be a hopeless romantic. No you don't. You expect too much. And then you get sad and disappointed
I need to stop expecting what I want to hear/see. Because its not gonna happen. No matter how much I want it to.
No but really I know it wasn't real but it felt so real that I just wanna lay in bed all day and eat nothing but chocolate and chips ;-;
Because everyone should have a dream about their bf/GF cheating on them. It feels awesome. Best dream 10/10

#LaidParty
@_BlueBlaze_ XD tbh i have no idea. I was bored and this entertained me lol
The bunch said farewell to me as they climbed onto their mothership and drove away to the world of Treasure Planet.
Again! Another side glance from The Lamp to the Pancake. Something fishy is going on here. Sorry Lamp.
Squirrels are being douchebags and laughing as hard as they can at the sight.
Bucket of fish heads is now on the Lamp. The bulb is flickering at the moment.
Now the Pancake just came back and has a bucket of fish heads.
It said its name is Bruce wayne. Definitely not Batman.
The waffle is now is sleeping in a tree like a bat. Maybe its Batman?
I think the screaming apples are calmed down. They are bent over and breathing hard from running and screaming.
Now the Squirrel is flirting with the talking Lamp, AND the Pancake.
I think the Pancake and talking Lamp have a "thing" going. They keep giving each other side glances.
If we do end up taking down the screaming apples, we can make Apple pie.
Anyone know how to take down a horde of screaming apples?
And there goes the waffle. He or she is rambling about how Pancakes are racist. *shrugs*
I just saw a squirrel running away from a talking lamp.
Ehhhhh
My sisters are complaining about having boyfriends and all then I'm just sitting here like "Yeah that must suck to be able to cuddle."
Gonna be seeing Guardians Of The Galaxy in two hours or so. Yeeee :D
FAV for Nash Grier

So I was just thinking, and i realized that one day i really am gonna be an old 80 year old lady and i don't know why i do this to myself :P
am i looking at your face? 
am i looking at your ass? 
no one knows.
Uh oh. It's thundering outside. I love rain, but thunder isn't my favorite &gt;.&lt;
I love this game, but it can be so frustrating at times &gt;.&lt;
