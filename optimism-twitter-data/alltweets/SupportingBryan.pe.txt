@NewAgeInsiders Pretty good show. Think Neville/Cena match of the night &amp; Bryans announcement was huge. Payback is going to be alright.
6.5/10 #RAW. 
-Harper &amp; Rowan together
-Cena/Neville
-Sandow &amp; Axel team up
-Bryan announcement
-Cesaro/Big E
-Main Event
AMBROSE HITS DIRTY DEEDS ON REIGNS
Want Reigns to turn on Ambrose so bad right now. #RAW
Good main event match, J &amp; J come and ends in a DQ. Kane enters the scene looking on, here comes AMBROSE &amp; REIGNS! #RAW
"FEAR! Fear of a Crumbling Economy! Fear of a Dying Earth."-Bray Wyatt #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders love that it's back. Hate how it's in May, need time to build it up so I would've had it in early-mid June.
So fucking happy, the Elimination Chamber match is PHENOMENAL. My god I'm so glad WWE brought it back, great decision by the company. #RAW
I love that it's back, but I don't like how it's in the end of May. Should've been early June, need time to build up the PPV. #RAW
FUCK YES OMG MY FAV STIPULATION MATCH OMG YESSSJSSJSJA
THE CHAMBER IS BACK
Cesaro wins, very good match. Big E is so talented as well as Cesaro, both guys could easily be great IC championships. #RAW
New Day vs Kidd &amp; Cesaro in a 2 out of 3 falls match is going to be terrific. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders He had to, it's what's best for him. I hope he hasn't but in my head I think he has. Going to be tough for him to return.
Not being able to see your favorite wrestler wrestle for awhile is tough, I've been through it last year and I will tell you it's not fun.
Calling it now, Bryan will come back at the rumble and win the thing as a surprise entrant at number 30. #RAW
#ThankYouDaniel
This is so sad, I'm going to miss Bryan a lot. Hope he comes back soon and with that being said he has to be 100% HEALTHY. #RAW
Don't retire.
Bryan looks pissed
Incredible. #RAW 


BRYANS NEXT YES!!!
Sandow and Axel baby!
Don't like Sandows new gimmick, pretty boring.
Tamina back in action in awhile!
Reigns vs Kane, eh. #RAW
#Paperback
Lana's turning face at Payback. #RAW
Tremendous match, Rusev interferes as it looked like Neville was closing in on a victory. #RAW
Whoever said Neville is being buried just leave Twitter because you sound like an idiot. #RAW
This is going to be a stellar match. #RAW
NEVILLE BABY!
That was awfully quick. #RAW
This is exactly what the tag division needs, two big men as a team. #RAW
Harper and Rowan are together!
Sheamus gets the upper hand after a huge brogue kick to Dolph. #RAW
BNB wins after a distraction from Sheamus, decent match. #RAW
Sheamus &gt; JBL &amp; Booker T combined, in terms of commentating. #RAW
Neville vs Barrett at Payback should be fantastic, the card for Payback is looking great so far. #RAW
KING BARRETT
Sheamus vs Ziggler is announced for Payback, I would've added a stipulation to it but it's not a big deal. #RAW
Why the hell is Ziggler wearing eyeliner? Looks ridiculous. #RAW
So intrigued to know what happens with Bryan, will be on the edge of my seat when he comes out. #RAW

That's....not how it works Book...
#RAW #WWE 
Ambrose wins in a fun match, Noble and Mercury put on a pretty good showing. #RAW
Oh no JBL, you're NOT wanted on commentary. #RAW
That pop for Ambrose though! #RAW
Noble and Mercury are set to face Ambrose up next! #RAW
HHH<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
My mans Noble spitting fire
Kane is getting involved no matter what at Payback.
Turkey neck<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Here comes Kane...
We want Ambrose chants surface around the arena, they're in his hometown tonight so expect a lot of it. #RAW
Felt like yesterday that Extreme Rules occurred. #RAW
There's only two matches on the Payback card... #RAW
Triple H is back! #Raw
#RAW
Bryan is probably going to drop the IC title tonight if he can't go at Payback, it's a good idea since he's been out for a long time.
@NewAgeInsiders Adam Rose. I know it's a weird pick, but he's a good wrestler with a bland character. He can show how good he is in the ring
Bryan coming back tonight is a good sign, it doesn't seem like it was a huge injury but he's gotta be careful in the ring from now on.
@NewAgeInsiders Way to soon. I love them together as a duo, but it just doesn't seem right at the moment.
@NewAgeInsiders I'm happy. I think the IC title will be defended against BNB since he didn't get his rematch yet, hope he stays healthy.
The only difference to this years &amp; last years main event at Payback is Batista &amp; HHH won't be in it, no difference. 
Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there, hope everyone has a great day!
Missed the action from Friday and Saturday? No problem. Here's all you need to know what happened in game 3 round 2.


Going to be a phenomenal PPV. 
@Sloomzo You're good.
@JoeyThorpe96 @Sloomzo I don't follow that account and they don't follow me<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JoeyThorpe96 I wouldn't mind that, think it would be good if he did.
@JoeyThorpe96 @LesnarSupport I think Rollins would then betray the authority since he's got Reigns &amp; Ambrose back in his corner.
@LesnarSupport Exactly.
@LesnarSupport Would be the shock of the year.
Just imagine if the Shield reunited at Payback and Roman and Dean helped SETH retain his championship, my god that would be spectacular.
Harper and Rowan would be a excellent tag team, they're big scary and talented. Brings more depth to the division.

Terrific podcast @NewAgeInsiders. The topics you guys brought up were very interesting &amp; you guys made good points on all of them. #NAIPod
Heyman &gt; Bearer.
The best.


@NewAgeInsiders I'm interested to see how HHH handles this when he has two key guys out for awhile. Going to be a tough 3-6 months.
@NewAgeInsiders Now it's being reported that Itami will be out for 6-8 months, thoughts?
@NewAgeInsiders shocked. I thought it was a work and not a real injury, feel bad for him. He had a great showing on RAW.
Watching NXT later tonight, hope it's a good show. The special in a couple of weeks is going to be tremendous, everyone should be watching.
WWE has to do something with the IC title, gotta address the situation soon because there's a lot of ?s regarding the title and DB health.
Barca just played great, can't really say anymore.
@LordRollins Oh alright.
@LordRollins ?
Hoping Bayern can get this W, going to be tough though without Ribery, Lewandowski, &amp; Robin.

Best #RAW of the Year, Sami Zayn's Debut &amp; Future, &amp; Much More on 

#WWE #NA…
Loved the e60, shows how bad a superstar wants to make it in WWE.
Feel bad for Graves, wish we got to see him on the main roster he had a lot of potential to be a good wrestler. #WWEe60
They're showing Adam Rose a lot in this E60
This is going to be great. #WWEe60
@xWweDeanx 8
The E:60 on NXT is going to be fantastic, can't wait until it starts.
Loved the start of round 2, here are my recap from the four games these past two days.


@NewAgeInsiders It seems to be bad, I hate seeing him like this because he's done so much for this company. Nearing his last days in life.
@NewAgeInsiders Fantastic show. Don't know what RAW this year has topped this, Seth/Dean was tremendous and could be MOTY. Great job by WWE.
8/10 #RAW. 
-Opening segment
-Tag Match
-Cesaro performance
-Rollins/Ambrose
-Zayn/Cena
-Main Event
Main event was pretty good, great show tonight
Rollins on commentary is going to be gold. #RAW
Surprised we're seeing Kane with Rollins right now. #RAW
Another day in the office for Neville. #RAW 


WHAT A BULL HAMER HOLY SHIT
Don't know when WWE will address the Bryan situation, seems very serious which isn't good. Have the feeling he'll be gone in 6 months. #RAW
I miss Bryan.
Well, this tag match should be fun. #RAW
Phenomenal. #RAW    


#AllHailKingBarrett
KING BARRETT!!
Like the pairing of Naomi and Tamina, should be a good heel stable. #RAW
No divas match, no surprise. #RAW
Loving this Cesaro/Kidd vs New Day feud, been a lot of fun to watch and the tag team division is actually building up to become better.
If you're wrestling John Cena during your #RAW debut, then you're doing something right. You people think one loss will kill a career.
@UWBushtit I'm not going anywhere, but I'm just saying in general they're fucking morons.
Tweets like this make me want to leave twitter. #RAW 
Terrific match, Zayn wrestled a fantastic match and he shined. Proud of him. #RAW
That execution on the Blue Thunder Bomb was beautiful. #RAW
Another kick out
THERES STILL A CHANCE
FUCKING ZAYN
Enough with the dick suck Booker
TAPPPPPPP
SAMI OVER THE TOP ROPE
The crowd will absolutely ERUPT if Zayn wins the United States title. #RAW

@KonryWWE Nah

The E:60 documentary on NXT looks amazing, definitely watching it tomorrow night. #RAW
Can't wait till Lana turns on Rusev at Payback, going to be a fun showing. #RAW
Being reported that Rusev is set to go on a losing streak in the upcoming weeks, thank god it didn't start tonight with Fandango. #RAW
LANA YOU SEXY HUMAN BEING
@NewAgeInsiders Very happy for him, he deserves this little push and he'll shine at Payback.
Rollins/Ambrose was AMAZING. These two guys are the FUTURE of the company, loved their match. #RAW
WHAT A MATCH AND AMBROSE IS GOING TO PAYBACK
AMBROSE WINS
Clothesline!
This match is fucking amazing. #RAW
Rollins and Ambrose are MAGIC in the ring, incredible match thus far. #RAW
I hate commercial breaks. #RAW
If Ambrose wins, we will get the shield vs Orton. Wow, what a sight that will be. #RAW
Ambrose being pushed to the main event is a good sign, he really needs it right now since he isn't in a top feud as of now. #RAW
Hope Ambrose wins, would love to see a fatal four way match at Payback for the title. #RAW
Still can't get over Cesaros performance just awhile ago, he's so over. #RAW
SETH ROLLINS BABY

Ryback is getting absolutely no reaction to his promo<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Wish Goldberg was in WWE
Haven't seen Ryback in street clothes before. #RAW
Rollins vs Ambrose is going to be great, renewing their rivalry is best for business! #RAW
Rollins vs Ambrose is happening tonight, with J &amp; J security banned from ringside. Seth is furious with Kane right now. #RAW
New Day as heels &gt; New Day as faces. #RAW
Orton vs Reigns in the main event for tonights show, love it. #RAW
After long 6 years, Kofi Kingston finally pinned a Randy Orton! #RAW
Big E should've pinned Orton, not Kofi. But nonetheless it was a good match and the ending told a story. #RAW
Kofi wins after Reigns spears Orton by accident, very good match in my mind. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders I actually liked how the New Day got involved, I enjoyed seeing them interrupt the opening segment &amp; we got a good match rn.
Big E is so talented yet underused. #RAW
The New Days jokes are worse than Roman Reigns is wrestling skills. #RAW
This is setting up a tag match with Orton &amp; Reigns being partners. #RAW
Randy Orton &gt; Roman Reigns, by FAR. #RAW
Orton kicking off RAW!
Monday Night #RAW starts now!
RAW HAS to be good tonight.
RAW is tonight, hope we see a good show because the buildup to Payback PPV has to be good.
@NewAgeInsiders BNB addressing everyone on his win, more matches, storyline progression, and more feud buildup.
@NewAgeInsiders She's a hypocrite. She wants to stop watching? Then let her, she'll be back by August. But HHH shouldn't be supporting Floyd

#NAIPod is going LIVE with #KingOfTheRing, Bryan's Future, Owens/Zayn's Place in H…
Owens just came and fucked things up, that's what he does. #NXT
Corbin vs Rhyno is going to be great.
Becky wins, surprised we got two diva matches on the show. #NXT
Itami vs Breeze vs Balor at Takeover is going to be tremendous, that decides the number one contender for the NXT championship. #NXT
Itami is about to wrestle rings around Adam Rose. #NXT
Dana Brooke beats Bailey after a distraction from Emma, still want to see more of her. #NXT
Want to see what Dana Brookes can do in her second match in NXT, she has a lot to prove. #NXT
Enzo and Cass win a decent match. #NXT
Riley vs Zayn is the main event for tonight, should be a good one. #NXT
Sami Zayn vs Kevin Owens is going to be such a phenomenal feud down the road in WWE, these two guys have a bright future man. #NXT
What an opening segment, Kevin Owens on the mic = gold. #NXT

@NewAgeInsiders The elimination chamber, those used to be one of my favorite matches because they were so exciting and hard hitting.

#SpreadTheWord

I've got to say, BNB looks great with that cape and crown on. Not disappointed with the result, I'm happy with who won either way. #KOTR
What a fucking bull hammer #KingOfTheRing
@noahhall069 Barrett, but I want Neville.
Battle of the English men! #KingOfTheRing
Hope this Neville vs Barrett match ends up being better than their match at Extreme Rules. #KingOfTheRing
Let's go Neville!
#RIPVerneGagne
@NewAgeInsiders Barrett. Think it's been good so far, this last match is going to be brilliant.
Think Barrett wins, want Neville though. Will be an early career defining moment. #KingOfTheRing
BNB wind a decent match. #KingOfTheRing
Barrett is going to win in 3 minutes, calling it from now. #KingOfTheRing
There has been more blood at King Of The Ring than there was at Extreme Rules. #KingOfTheRing
Sheamus is bleeding
Good match, I'm surprised that Neville beat Sheamus though. He's one win away from becoming #KingOfTheRing
Neville wins!
I was invited to a friends house to watch WM 23, I got hooked on it and found out about RAW, Smackdown, &amp; ECW. #HowIBecameAWWEFan
@Roonofhonor 8 PM Eastern time
@NewAgeInsiders Only reason why he's a know man is because of WWE, this fake wrestling is the reason why he's successful.
Saw a lot of people tweet that Rusev/Cena needs to end now cause it's getting boring, the feud hasn't been boring it's going on for to long.
@NewAgeInsiders It was expected. I think it helps Ryback more because he's in a big time feud while for Bray it's a huge downgrade.
@NewAgeInsiders Decent show. Could've been better but it wasn't boring, Harper/Neville was match of the night.
5/10 RAW. 
-Opening Segment
-Wyatt attacks Ryback
-Harper/Ambrose
-Main Event
And a triple threat match it is, that was a hard one man. #RAW
Orton and Reigns win after Kane attacks Rollins and J &amp; J security, pretty good ending to the match though. #RAW
This match needs a clean finish. #RAW
Main event time!
The kid from NXT wins! That was the match of the night, marvelous match between both guys. #RAW
Neville is something else man, his athleticism is just amazing. #RAW
Neville vs Harper, this should be terrific. #RAW
Can't wait until tough enough. #RAW
Creepy Wyatt promo, questioning this feud with Ryback though. #RAW
Rematch for the tag titles on Smackdown, should be good.
Love how Sandow was just brutally honest during that promo, hope WWE books him right and they find him the right character to work with #RAW
Oh dear here comes Axel
YOUR WELCOME
Wondering what Sandow is going to do next, hope for nothing but the best. #RAW
CAPS WIN BABY
Sandow is back!
@NewAgeInsiders No surprise there, he's most likely going to win the whole thing.
Ambrose/Ziggler feud? Would be absolutely phenomenal. #RAW
Ziggler attacks Sheamus! Sheamus wins the match though via DQ. #RAW
No way Dean taps here
Really don't want Sheamus winning the tournament, and I want Dean to win this match. But nonetheless this should be a great fight. #RAW
Let's go Ambrose!
Pretty obvious Naomi would win...
Are the Bellas hell or face? I really can't tell<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Naomi should kill Brie in this one
This second hour has dragged honestly, disappointed with how RAW has turned out. #RAW
That was literally pointless, could've gave us a real health update. #RAW
BRYAN HEALTH UPDATE FINALLY
Fandango lost, Rose wins in and out of the ring. #RAW
Truth wins, decent match. #RAW
Stardust is going to win. #RAW
The triple threat match is definitely going to happen, hope Rollins wins without cheating at Payback. #RAW
Lana will have something to do with the finish to Cena vs Rusev in three weeks, might not go Cenas way though. #RAW
Lana is more over than anyone right now. #RAW
Rusev lands a super kick on Slaters face from behind! #RAW
LMFAO SLATER<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Think Cena vs Rusev needs to end at Payback, both guys need to move on and they will because Cena is obviously gonna win. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Decent first hour, think the opening segment has been the most entertaining part of the show. Hour 2 NEEDS to be great.
Bray vs Reigns would've been better, but I'm OKAY with this. Hope this feud turns out to be gold. #RAW
Sister Abigal!
ITS BRAY BABY
Think Bray will come out after the match to defend his brother, makes the most sense. #RAW
3 weeks? That's awfully quick, Rusev vs Cena should be excellent at Payback. #RAW
That was quick, awfully to quick. #RAW
BNB wins, good match though. We'll probably see Ziggler distract Sheamus during his match and cost him, want Ambrose to win. #RAW
They just got back from commercial break, so they go back to it once we're 2 minutes into the match. Nice logic, @WWE. #RAW
Think Barrett beats Ziggler here, I think King Barrett sounds great and I hope he goes far in the tournament. Don't think Dolph has a chance
@IowaAmbroseGirl I was being sarcastic
@Humanipathic Yep
The WWE universe has to decide who faces Rollins at Payback, hmmm this should be hard to predict. #RAW
Fucking hate the Bieber chants
Yeah we're most likely getting a triple threat for the WWE title at Payback. #RAW
"I can wrestle circles around you Kane."-Seth Rollins. #RAW
Kane is killing it on the mic right now. #RAW
SKO
I remember when Seth used to be bad on the mic, now he's brilliant on it! He has massively improved in that category &amp; it's important he did
It's Rollins baby!!
Great opening to #RAW
It's finally time for Monday Night #RAW!
This is going to be a fantastic tournament, some of the matches we could see are going to be outstanding. 
King of the ring is back baby, so happy WWE is actually bringing it back! RAW should be a good show tonight.
@NewAgeInsiders Think Ziggler needs it the most right now, I expect Sheamus to win though.
@NewAgeInsiders Think Woods shouldn't wrestle and have him be just the mouthpiece, Kofi and Big E are more talented than him as well.

It was clearly only banned for Orton.

7.5/10, thought this was a very good PPV &amp; it surprised many. Happy that WWE put on a good show tonight, they badly needed to. #ExtremeRules
Guess it was only banned for Orton, but we'll find out tomorrow night. #ExtremeRules
Great match, what a sequence to end the match when Rollins hit the RKO on Randy to retain his title. #ExtremeRules
ROLLINS USED THE RKO HE WINS ROLLINS WINS!!
RKO!!
Orton is still alive!
Orton is chokeslamed, and so is Rollins! #ExtremeRules
Double chokeslam!
Kane knocked down but hit both guys with the cage door, he's about to go kick ass! #ExtremeRules
Loving this match all around, wanna see how this ends. #ExtremeRules
The Punt!
What a pedigree by Orton, Rollins kicks out at 2 and a half! #ExtremeRules
Seth Rollins is first title defense starts now, here we go! #ExtremeRules
@NewAgeInsiders Think Kane tries to help Orton win but Rollins eventually escapees the cage from the top and not the door.
I'm admitting this, Kane has been growing on me during this Orton/Rollins feud, I love what he's doing &amp; I hope he goes back to the mask.
Cena vs Rusev in a I quit match will occur at Payback, should be a terrific match. #ExtremeRules
The live KOTR tournament is going to be brilliant, so happy they're putting it on the network. #ExtremeRules
Waiting on Bray to save his brother like...
Not that bad of a match from Roman and Show, was pretty obvious that Reigns would win though. #ExtremeRules
Interested to see what Lana will tell the authority. #ExtremeRules
Decent match, Brie helps Nikki pick up the win. Naomi wrestled real well. #ExtremeRules
Naomis new theme is better than her old one, like the new look she has now. Should be a good match if given time, think Nikki retains.
@NewAgeInsiders Good match. Think he's gotta feud with someone that's not holding a title but is a main event guy. Think Neville beats him.
Good match, the ending was meh. I think we should've seen a better ending. #ExtremeRules
Lana = Sable. #ExtremeRules
Lana<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't see Cena losing this match, to early for him to drop the title and I don't want him to because he'll make it relevant. #ExtremeRules
2-2 so far in my predictions, been a very good show. Cena vs Russv is next which is going to be brilliant! #ExtremeRules
Ambrose wins! He finally wins a singles PPV match since he was last with the shield, it's been a long time but it feels good. #ExtremeRules
@NewAgeInsiders Great match. Though I would've preferred Cesaro and Kidd to win and keep the gold, nonetheless I'm happy for Big E.
THEY ARE BACK
Happy for Big E, he hasn't held a title in a long time and he deserves it.
Incredible match though, a ton of great spots and a back and forth paste was seen in this match a lot. Loved it &amp; the New Day are champs.
You have got to be fucking kidding me, the New Day are the new tag team champions.
What a freaking match
Natalya is so sexy
Tag team action is next, should be a fun match! #ExtremeRules
KING OF THE RING IS BACK!???
Smart finish by WWE, the match was pretty good and it didn't disappoint. #ExtremeRules
Ziggler got fucked up from that bridge kick.
Low blow
The fan girls are going fucking nuts
PUCKER UP PUCKER UP!
Ziggler wins! Pretty good match, now Sheamus has got to kiss ass!
What a counter by Ziggler
This is sweet. #ExtremeRules 
Sheamus vs Dolph bout to be outstanding, could be MOTN. #ExtremeRules
@NewAgeInsiders Sheamus. Arse won't get kissed but Sheamus will brutally hurt Dolph after the match.
Yeah WWE muted the crowd chant boring during the backstage segment, really want to see the finish between Harper and Ambrose. #ExtremeRules
Imagine Punk drives them back to the arena<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I fucking love this Ambrose/Harper match, I really hope that they find them fighting in the streets. #ExtremeRules
Kane and Rollins about to go at it!
YES!

Backstage they go!
This needs to go outside the ring and into the backstage arena, god that'd be awesome. #ExtremeRules

Won't be surprised if Ziggler leaves the WWE, there have been signs that shown he could leave and will soon. Hope he doesn't though.
@TonyKegger Have fun man!
@NewAgeInsiders Concerned. He'll probably retire sooner or later which will hurt me to see him do.
Bryan will not compete tonight which is not a shocker, very nervous to hear what is wrong with him because it's very serious.
@NewAgeInsiders My predictions for Extreme Rules: 


Would love it if everyone checked out my Extreme Rules predictions!


Hope Harper vs Ambrose goes to the limit tonight, I actually want to see a STREET FIGHT between the two because it'll be fucking great.
Round 1 game 3 roundups for the NBA Playoffs written by yours truly: 


@NewAgeInsiders I think it's over for him if he doesn't compete. Even if it's not his neck it's still bad because that causes more problems.
Extreme Rules is tonight, thinking the show will be pretty good even though people are sleeping on it.

@OhiosLunatic Some type of DDT.
WHAT AN RKO
Don't like Seth is new finisher, doesn't seem to hurt that bad to knock someone out. It also doesn't fit him as a character. #RAW
Yep. The curb stomp truly is gone.
I like how they changed Rollins is music, sounds better. #RAW
Rollins says he's sorry, damn.

"It's funny cause it's food." Ryback, just go home. #RAW
Alright Orton where you at?
A Reigns/Wyatt feud is what I'm looking at right about now, now that's what I want to see. I hope to dear god it's not Ryback. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders think I got an idea of who Bray is talking to, either Reigns or Orton.
IT'S WYATT BABY
So Ambrose vs Harper is a Chicago street fight, that should be a fun match to watch. Tag titles on the pre-show which is no surprise. #RAW
So it depends on Bryans health, hope he is okay man. Really worried if he'll retire early.
That's the fourth RKO!
Summer turns on Mizdow, and helps the Miz keeps his brand. #RAW
Damn, Rusev got Cenas nose badly. #RAW
Cena beats Kane in a decent match, it got exciting towards the end. #RAW
Surprisingly, Kane is Cenas open challenge. RAW
Thinking Neville will be Cenas challenger.

Brilliant.
#WWE #RAW 
Great save by Dolph, the match would've been pointless without him getting involved. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders I love everything about his gimmick. But, he needs to be feuding with one guy that proves he's back to being legit.
Feel bad for Ryder
Well, Bo just got fucked up.
Bo Dallas is brilliant on the mic. #RAW
IT'S BO
Naomi vs Brie was a pretty good match, didn't expect much from it and I was shocked with the way WWE booked it. #RAW
Loved that segment, Randy needs to go on a rampage and just start hitting 10 RKOs Ina row in the backstage area. #RAW
RKO
"Naomi might be the greatest diva of all time."-Booker T. This guy is on some type of drug. #RAW

#WWE #RAW #BrieVsNaomi 
Nikki is a dime. #RAW
Ziggler vs Rollins is tonight, should be a terrific match. Loved what Rollins said, he is the man not the future. #RAW
@Jzr__11 Said it during his promo

#WWE #RAW 
Guardian of the gate? Lmaoo
That was a stellar promo from Kane, I'm shocked. #RAW
DAMN KANE
Rollins haa!
And of course Kane interrupts HHH

Winning man and woman decided by the board and the Un…
You will never find talent like Seth Rollins on tough enough, ridiculous statement by HHH. #RAW
#TripleHReturns
@NewAgeInsiders Love it. Been a couple of good segments and a good tag match, second hour has to be better if they want the show to be good
@tammys85 agreed
They played the wrong music<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Fandango on a roll
Axel mania baby
FANDANGOooooo
Big Show vs Reigns at Extreme Rules is going to be my shit break. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders It was a very good match, the way it ended wasn't so good and I don't like that they won. They BETTER lose at Extreme Rules.
Orton strikes an RKO from nowhere! #RAW
You've got to be kidding, the new day wins via count out because of Woods is heel tactics. #RAW
Kalisto is phenomenal.
Finally WWE is back from commercial break, they have so many of them and take so long to come back from them. #RAW
Big E has been so irrelevant since he last won the IC title, so much talent but he's so underutilized. #RAW
No way the Lucha Dragons lose this match, them facing Kidd &amp; Cesaro would be wonderful. #RAW
That backstage segment was interesting, but in WWEs world 3 guys can't stop one. #Raw
Either a street fight or a falls count anywhere match will be the stipulation for this match on Sunday. #RAW
Loved that short little promo from Harper, just a couple of words and it was great. #RAW
Want to see Randy RKO random guys backstage, would be fucking awesome. #RAW
RANDY ORTON
Randy Orton is very underrated on the mic. #RAW
The champ!
"You Seth Rollins are one dumb bastard."-Randy Orton
Orton opening up RAW tonight as he enters the steel cage. #RAW
After a slow long week, #RAW is live!
Before RAW starts, take a look at my article about my roundup for game one round one of the NBA Playoffs. 


Why would WWE banned the Curb Stomp? It's not that dangerous of a move and I can think of much more moves that could hurt people more.
@NewAgeInsiders l think Dean will win but Bray SHOULD win. He's had two huge feuds that he lost in &amp; he needs something big in the next year
@NewAgeInsiders I expect to see them tonight, but I don't know when they will really be put to end. When they are done, we need a RAW GM.
This week on twitter: 23 new followers, 15 new unfollowers  and followed 4 people via 
RAW is tomorrow, it's gotta be a good go home show so people are hyped for Extreme Rules. It's been a slow week.
@DCMatthews_NAI Happy Birthday, enjoy it man!
This is beautiful. 
I love wrestling
Sheamus vs Ziggler is going to be an outstanding match at Extreme Rules, but the stipulation to it is pretty stupid.
#FF @NewAgeInsiders @DCMatthews_NAI @BillNevilleNAI @LordRollins @Humanipathic @Love2HulkSmash @Schnazzy @Roonofhonor @LiamNAI @seethekidwin
@TheLordJalapeno @IowaAmbroseGirl @ashley_612 @SupportingBryan @NXT_FAN916 @HEEL_…
Smackdown is honestly just not improving as a show &amp; people barely tune into it anymore. Only way it'll be relevant again is if it goes live
We will find out if there's something going on with Bryans neck if he drops the IC title at Extreme Rules or the RAW after Extreme Rules.
@NewAgeInsiders Austin/Punk,(if I could get Punk to come back) HBK/Bryan, Hart/Rollins, Hogan/Cena

#NAIPod

#NAI #WWE #WWENXT
NXT was pretty decent, main event was good.
NXT has been pretty good, didn't like Danas debut at all tbh. Feel like she doesn't have the x-factor in her.
GOALL
What a bad start
LETS GO CAPITALS

#W…
@NewAgeInsiders Same here. He has such a big future before he had surgery &amp; just like that his career will be over before we know it.
@TheQueenHEEL Happy Birthday! Congrats on 11 million followers<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@JustinLaBar Right here
DB has been pulled for the rest of the European tour, you were right when you said he shouldn't have came back for the RR @NewAgeInsiders
@The_Nemesis__ No. His attack on Harper just happened on RAW &amp; I don't think they'll fight at ER, hope they do though. Wanna see them feud.
Wanna see Dean in a feud in the upcoming weeks, can't just leave him out when the guy is a future star in the company &amp; has ton of potential
From competing in the main event of WM, to now facing Big Show at Extreme Rules is a total downgrade for Reigns. WWE are out of their minds.
Being reported that DB is in poor condition &amp; he's injured, he hasn't been in action in weeks on RAW &amp; is competing in tag matches. Bad news
Marvelous.


@NewAgeInsiders Thought it was a success all the way until WM, thought he should've won tbh. nWo shouldn't have helped him bc he hated them.
RAW was a 7/10 for me, thought there were a few matches that were outstanding. Segments were perfected the right way as well. #RAWLondon
Ending to tonights RAW was good, WWE put themselves into a good position where now they need to just cap off the go home show for ER.
Steel cage matches aren't the same like they once were, but hey at least the match has a stipulation added to it. #RAW
Seth Rollins is just class
Don't ever say Neville was buried, him &amp; Ziggler had the match of the night and Neville is having amazing matches while just being called up
GO ZIGGLER GO
Spectacular match from Neville &amp; Ziggler, so impressed by Neville &amp; the way he's performed ever since being called up. #RAW
Neville is PHENOMENAL. #RAW
Adrian Neville is the most athletic wrestler on WWEs roster. #RAW
This match is going to blow the roof off this place if given 10 minutes of time. #RAW
NEVILLE VS ZIGGLER OMG
That was a great promo from Naomi, she spoke nothing but the truth. But I do think AJ should be in the HOF
If these guys face each other at Extreme Rules I'll be extremely happy, my god a street fight between Harper &amp; Ambrose would be tremendous.
Yes Harper and Ambrose brawl!
All I'm asking for is a Luke Harper win, hasn't gotten one in weeks. #RAW
PTP need to wrestle more, pretty good tag team IMO. #RAW
Mizdow wins!
Summer Rae is something else man
Mizdow is a stud, kicked Mizs ass and made out with Summer Rae afterward. #RAWLondon
Hope Orton vs Rollins is an 60 minute iron man match, but that's definitely NOT happening. #RAW
Rollins wins!
CHOKESLAM
#BringBackTheMask
Kane fighting back!
Well Kane comes out with no ring gear
IT'S SETH ROLLINS BABY
If Kane is bringing the mask back which I think he is, I want him to stay like that for a long time &amp; return to being the big red machine.
I wanna see Bryan in action tonight, missed him last week on RAW.
Where's Dr. Shelby when you need him? #RAW
A Team Hell No reunion!
THEY ARE FANDANGOING IN LONDON WHAT
Stardust wins in under 2 minutes. #RAWLondon
Just a reminder that Fandango beat Chris Jericho at WrestleMania 29 cleanly.
Quick match for Dean
Dean Ambrose is going to kill Adam Rose
Adam Rose? Adam Rose? He's on RAW? WHAT
Wonder how the main event is going to play out.
Rollins would wrestle rings around Kane
Tyson Kidd is so underrated. #RAWLondon
WE DONT FUCKING LIKE HANDICAP MATCHES YOU FUCKTARDS @WWE
Weird seeing Cesaro wear knee pads, usually never does. #RAW
Cesaro vs Orton, here we go!
@NewAgeInsiders 
Not gonna lie, Show fucked up Roman there but there's really no point in having these two go at it. #RAW
You fat bastard<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I love London man #RAWLondon
Good work from Roman there, liked the promo. I honestly hope he does retire the Big Show lowkey. #RAW
LUCHA LUCHA
Wyatt just excels at his promos, still amazes me how he writes all of this. #RAW
Bray is teasing his new opponent, wonder who it is!
There is the Naomi heel turn!
@NewAgeInsiders Don't see why she needs it, already been a 2x champ &amp; it's Naomis turn to hold the belt since she hasn't yet. Bad decision.
This divas division is complete shit, WWE should call up some NXT divas to the main roster because it would help A LOT.
Paige wins, I honestly don't get why she'd get a title shot if Naomi has pinned the champ twice &amp; hasn't gotten a title shot Ina long time.
There goes Emma
How does Rosa eliminate Nattie and Summer Rae?
I see Naomi winning this match, if not her I'll go with Paige since she's in her hometown tonight. #RAW
Cesaro vs Orton is going to be fantastic as well as Rollins/Orton, so far so good to start off tonights #RAW!
@SupportingBryan Chain match*
A Russian chamber match? What in fucks name...
Good match, loved the back &amp; forth action to close the match. The US title feels so much more relevant than it was 3 months ago. #RAWLondon
Super Cena just kicked out at 2 once again!
The Foley!
Love the pop that BNB is getting here at his hometown, it's much needed &amp; deserved. #RAW
It's BNB!
#RAWUK 
WrestleMania in London would be fucking great. #RAWLondon
Happy to see Cole back ONLY because Byron Saxton was terrible at commentary. #RAW
Cena getting the hate from a hot crowd to kick off #RAWLondon
#RAWLondon
Really can't wait for RAW tonight, hearing it's a good show &amp; I'm relying on it for my night to be made.
This week on twitter: 17 new followers, 16 new unfollowers  and followed One person  via 
I hate it when people tweet out spoilers, there's other people that don't want to know who beat who &amp; what happened during the show.
I can't wait for tonights RAW mostly because of how hot the crowd will be because WWE is in the UK. Can always count on them being hot.
@NewAgeInsiders I'm hoping that he stays on WWE TV until Brock returns because he can make RAW better with 1 promo. Gotta promote Brock more
@NewAgeInsiders I'd love to see him go at Cena for the US title to kick things off with this new run, they can't make him irrelevant again.
@NewAgeInsiders Most likely Neville, he'd get a huge pop. If not then I can see Sheamus.
@Humanipathic Either that or probably a no holds bard match.
Extreme Rules needs to be more "extreme" if you want to put it that way. There needs to be more stipulations added to matches as well.
One thing I hate when WWE is in the UK is that people tweet spoilers about RAW &amp; it kills the whole point of watching the show.
@NewAgeInsiders I think the NXT title because he would've been called up already &amp; I don't want WWE to mess him up if his push is rushed.
@HoundsOfBryan There's people that I follow that are Punk fans that are saying Bryan doesn't get hate because he said that.
Bryan isn't disrespecting wrestling by saying it's "fake" Punk called it "Phony Wrestling" &amp; was being an asshole dissing the company.
To me, Punk using the terms "Fake Wrestling" &amp; "Phony Wrestling" about the WWE is pretty stupid because without the WWE he's a nobody.
@NewAgeInsiders I love the guy &amp; all but without "Fake Wrestling" he doesn't become the man he is today, it's ridiculous that he said that.
@NewAgeInsiders Rollins/Cena/Lesnar at the Royal Rumble for the title.
#FF @NewAgeInsiders @DCMatthews_NAI @BillNevilleNAI @LordRollins @Schnazzy @Love2HulkSmash @LiamNAI @Humanipathic @Joe2theNAI @EthanPWT
@NewAgeInsiders I think all three will go in solo and not as a group, but time is to early to tell.
Summer Rae is smoking fucking hot. #SmackDown
Neville is just incredible, he's a fucking stud.
YESS NEVILLE
Big Show on the mic is the worst thing ever. #Smackdown
Bryan &gt; Sheamus.
Bryan kicking off #SmackDown!
Naomi vs Nikki would be great at Extreme Rules, it's Noamis time to hold the gold.
Cena/Bryan at SS in 2013 was outstanding. I want to see them go at it one more time &amp; I would love it if they had another match at WM 32.
@NewAgeInsiders HHH/Rock, Sting/Taker, shield triple threat, Cena/Bryan, &amp; Lesnar/Wyatt
@NewAgeInsiders Gonna check out the podcast tomorrow, hearing it's a good one! I also heard you might interview Goldberg, hope you guys do.
A year ago today, Ultimate Warrior passed away. He will be remembered forever, a true legend.
Roman Reigns and the Miz main evented a WrestleMania and CM Punk didn't, let that sink in.
The good old days. 
@NewAgeInsiders feels like he gave what the fans wanted &amp; they don't need it again. He's moved on &amp; is looking towards the future.
@NewAgeInsiders It hurts me to say this, but I think he won't hold another world title because of what WWE gave him last year. Vince (1/2)
Fast 7 is the best movie I have ever watched, that was worth two hours.
About to watch fast 7!
When you see Lanas ass.


@Roonofhonor I can understand why
@Roonofhonor yah
Sheamus &gt; BNB.
With SD moving to the USA Network, I hope that it would go live because then it would be relevant again. But I don't think WWE would do that
This week on twitter: 37 new followers, 27 new unfollowers  and followed 3 people via 
Orton vs Rollins is going to be fantastic at Extreme Rules, it's a good way to start off Seths title reign &amp; the people want this.
Last nights podcast with Y2J &amp; Cena was great, I have a different perspective on Cena now.
2 years ago today, we witnessed one of the greatest streak matches of all time as the Undertaker defeated CM Punk. 
@WinSamiWin 4
Gonna check out Y2Js podcast with Cena later on tonight, should be good from what I'm hearing.
Poor RAW tonight, I rate it a 4.5/10. 
-Neville/Rollins
-Cena/Stardust
-Wyatt promo
Rollins curb stomps Orton to close out the show after the match. #RAW
Orton wins, thank god. #RAW
@Humanipathic Probably, but they should've ended the feud there.
Why in fucks name do you have Sandow lose? WWE is so stupid it's not even funny. #RAW
Gotta be kidding me...
I would've saved this match for Extreme Rules. #RAW
Let's go Damien! #RAW
Wyatt is still the new face of fear even though he lost to Taker at WM, but I wonder who he was directing to during his promo. #RAW
Do I have everybody's attention now?
WYATT IS ALIVE
So now BNB is using his rematch clause at Extreme Rules &amp; will face Bryan in a one on one match for the title. #RAW
Sheamus gets the easy win
WWE is already having a bad show tonight, now they decide to bring out Mark Henry? This guy hasn't been relevant since 2011. #RAW
When Roman Reigns picks up the microphone. #RAW 
STOP COCKING YOUR FIST ROMAN #RAW
Sheamus is new theme song is fucking sick, love the way his character is formatted now. #RAW
If I was Kane, I would've fucked every single diva that was in his office. #RAW
Kane just announced we'll see a divas battle royal next week on RAW &amp; the winner will face Nikki for the divas championship. #RAW
Boring match, we've seen it like 40 fucking times already. #RAW
Sign of the year. #RAW 
Suplex City Bitch
@NewAgeInsiders Only good thing about RAW tonight was Neville/Rollins &amp; Cena/Stardust, the rest has been flat out horrendous.
The man gravity forgot. #RAW   


The Lucha Dragons win, fun match. #RAW
The Lucha Dragons are about to shine in this match, especially Kalisto! #RAW
The new day sucks chant<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Ryback wins, no surprise here. #RAW
Saxton is just doing a horrible job tonight at the commentary table, I'd never thought I'd say this but I wish Cole was here tonight. #RAW
Luke Harper better win #RAW

It's just sad no…
Decent divas match #RAW
Why the fuck does Naomi still have that "Somebody Call My Mama" theme song, just retire it already<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #RAW
Terrific match, Cena came out on top like the obvious. #RAW
It's Stardust! #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Outstanding match, Neville proved he can hang with the champ in the ring &amp; his future is very bright. Will be a WWEWHC 1 day
Who will be Cenas challenge this week?
What a sell by Neville #RAW 


I couldn't ask for more from both guys, they both wrestled a tremendous match. #RAW
Seth wins in a incredible match. #RAW
Not a DQ man
WOW
Neville doesn't need to win, him competing in the ring with the WWE champion ALREADY looks good for him. Everyone knows he can go. #RAW
Neville is such a stud, man his athletic ability is just marvelous. He can work with anyone in the damn ring. #RAW
This match is going to be spectacular. #RAW
NXT NXT NXT NXT
NEVILLE VS ROLLINS YES YES YES
ITS NEVILLE
THIS. #RAW 
I want Seth to wrestle Bryan, god that'd be magnificent. #RAW
Harper/Ryback won't be that bad, think it has the potential to be a good match. #RAW
Reigns vs Big Show is going to be horrendous. #RAW
Bad match that ends with a bad finish. #RAW
Don't get why they'd put Ryback in the triple threat match, he's done nothing to be put it in &amp; has been irrelevant for awhile. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Decent way to kick off RAW. Like the triple threat match that's announced for later tonight, Seth is great on the mic.
Triple threat match will be tremendous later on tonight, good main event for tonights show. #RAW
Hope Orton wins the triple threat match.
The only way I will take Kane seriously again is if he put the mask back on, &amp; kicked some ass. #RAW
Orton crashes the party!
Kane you're still Takers half brother. #RAW
Oh no, Big Show please drop your mic. #RAW
Rollins cashed in not sold out! #RAW
Rollins kicking off tonight's show, this should be fun! #RAW
Thank god Byron Saxton has some help tonight at the commentary table, he was horrible last week. #RAW
Gotta be a good show tonight! #RAW
#RAW time!
@LostInStereoLiz Only JBL &amp; Booker T
Micheal Cole isn't calling tonights action due to his "injury"
Bryan vs Barrett vs Sheamus vs Ziggler for the IC title is expected to happen at Extreme Rules, love fatal 4 ways &amp; this one will be amazing
This shirt is brilliant. 
Harper vs Ambrose in a I quit match would be the best way to go if it happened. I want to see it &amp; it'd be an incredible match.
Exactly a year ago today, Daniel Bryan defeated HHH, then went on to beat Orton &amp; Batista to become the WWEWHC. 
Adrian Neville accepting Cenas open challenge to fight for the US title would be great, the match would be terrific &amp; it'd help Adrian a lot
Cory Graves was going to be a fantastic wrestler until he had several concussions &amp; was forced to retire, sad to see his career end shortly.
Hope Bray Wyatt wins the MITB briefcase this year, he needs it &amp; it'll help him A LOT if he carries it &amp; cashes in successfully.
@NewAgeInsiders Barretts last reign as champ was very boring, the only thing I liked to it was that he defended it in a ladder match at WM.
@NewAgeInsiders He eventually will win 16, but for a couple of years he should help the mid-card guys getting over/evaluating the US title.
@NewAgeInsiders Don't see Barrett holding gold for a long time in WWE, Rusev on the other hand will see the main event scene later this year
RAW tomorrow night, really excited for the show &amp; I'm interested to see if WWE can put on a good show.
How can you say AJ has done nothing for the divas division? Did you see what she did to it &amp; how she made it better? Brought life back to it
Seth Rollins is the WWE Champion whether you like it or not.
Ronda Rousey would break Stephanie McMahon in the matter of 30 seconds.
It's been 434 days since CM Punk was last in a WWE ring, time flies man.
Cena &gt; Reigns.
HBK/Taker at WM 25 should've been the main event of the show, greatest match in WM history. Can't believe it was 6 years ago today.
434, never forget.
I love professional wrestling.
Sheamus is going to be a great heel, I love his new look &amp; he thrives to be a heel.
Hoping Seth Rollins holds the WWE Title for 230 days plus.
@WWERollins @TheJimCornette @steveaustinBSR @TheRock @CMPunk @WWEAJLee @realmickfoley @JRsBBQ @EdgeRatedR SETH SPITTING FIRE
@NewAgeInsiders He did because he beat the streak, then came back &amp; just demolished JOHN CENA to become WWE Champ, holds it for 200+ days
And those people were wrong. 
@WWECrowe Favortie diva to watch in NXT? #AskCrowe
So bored, what should I watch on the WWE Network?
@heel_world no she won't
Hope we get a retirement speech from AJ.
@LordRollins @WWO_Army Gavin's been my friend for about a year<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ShroomMeister They do, but she brought the division back from how bad it was.
@LordRollins Agreed.
AJ is so young, she's 28 &amp; she had at least 3-6 years left of wrestling.
@LesnarSupport Oh, that's weird
@LesnarSupport Why'd he block you?
AJ should definitely be inducted into the HOF, she deserves it.
Sasha Banks &amp; Charlotte are the future of the WWE divas division.
There's really nothing left for AJ to do in WWE other than have great matches with the young upcoming divas, see why she retired.
Classic AJ. 
AJ has accomplished so much in her career, she's done as much as she can to be successful &amp; she can say she's one of the greatest ever.
#ThankYouAJ
To all of you Bella fans enjoying this moment, AJ Lee brought meaning back to the divas division so I wouldn't be happy if I were you.
@NewAgeInsiders I'm shocked, this was out of nowhere &amp; she will be missed. She is a HOF in my mind because she's done a lot for the division
AJ was one of the best divas on WWEs roster, it's sad to see her go tbh.
AJ RETIRED
Roman Reigns is time will come, just be patient people.
@CMPUNK_BITW99 Don't know, he'll prove he can be in the main event.
It's great to see Eva Marie not on TV cause she's training hard to get better in the ring, I LOVE that cause she cares about getting better.
Love how the US title is getting a new design since Cena is holding it, it'll look much better. Like how it's getting more attention now.
Samoa Joe vs Brock Lesnar would be tremendous.
I really can't wait until Finn Balor gets called up to the main roster, he's a fucking stud.
10 years ago today, John Cena won his first World Championship in WWE.
@Rampaigedx Oh, dear.
It would've been such a mess if Reigns won the title at WM, happy that WWE decided to change their mind &amp; hand it over to Rollins.
@RawIsRollins HBK.
Going into the show, Reigns was suppose to beat Brock &amp; become the new WWE Champ. But Seth was told he'd cash in during the Rock/HHH segment
The greatest. 


#FF @NewAgeInsiders @DCMatthews_NAI @BillNevilleNAI @LordRollins @Schnazzy @Love2HulkSmash @BaneofWrestling @LiamNAI @Humanipathic @EthanPWT
@NewAgeInsiders He accomplished a lot, I think he gets in because if any WCW star gets in the HOF then so should Goldberg. He's earned it.
Feels good to be on spring break, got a week off of school.
@NewAgeInsiders Goldberg, HBK, Punk, Stone Cold(he will wrestle one more time) &amp; Bret Hart.

@Love2HulkSmash @NewAgeInsiders @dylancelone @SnowMan2989 It should happen
@NewAgeInsiders @SnowMan2989 @Love2HulkSmash That's the best spear I have ever seen, now I know why you're so obsessed with him.
@NewAgeInsiders @Love2HulkSmash @WrestlingLAD Oh my god, he broke Christian in half.
@Love2HulkSmash @WrestlingLAD @NewAgeInsiders HOLY SHIT
Outstanding match, these two have phenomenal in ring chemistry. 
Isn't everyday #AmbroseAppreciationDay for Ambrose fangirls? They look pretty stupid for starting this, it's pretty pointless lmao
The best duo of all time. 
Imagine Finn Balor is called up before SummerSlam &amp; then challenges Rollins for the WWE title, think that has the chance to be MOTY.
WrestleMania 31 is the best WrestleMania I have ever watched live, it passed my expectations by a landslide &amp; I'm happy that it did.
@NewAgeInsiders Couldn't be more proud of how far you guys have come, congrats guys!

This is just the beginning

Something I want to see Rusev do more often.


Ziggler &gt; Ambrose, in terms of wrestling ability.
@PontillasThomas wasn't there
Hope Rollins vs Orton has a stipulation added to it at Extreme Rules, hopefully its a falls count anywhere match.

@NewAgeInsiders It was no surprise, but if Rusev won it would've been a HUGE victory that showed his winning streak is legit.
Itami/Breeze will be tremendous tonight, love 2 out of 3 falls match because you always know you'll see a good match bc of the stipulation.
Natalya &gt; Naomi.
Ready for next years Mania? 
CJ Parker has just been released by WWE, not surprised because he's useless anyway.
Bryan vs Itami needs to happen in the next year or two, the matches they'll provide us with will be fantastic.
@Love2HulkSmash @cchopz @ABCDEFGHIJoe oh my<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
This is great. 
@LevellerLOW Hulk Hogan is overrated in the ring
@ZigglersBetter Nope. Still March
Being reported that WWE wants to give Lana a big push. Don't know if she'll be in the ring or become a manager for a well known wrestler.
I wanna see the Lucha Dragons face Kidd &amp; Cesaro at Extreme Rules for the tag titles, has the potential to be a phenomenal match.
@NewAgeInsiders WWE played this real well, it's a good way to send him off TV for awhile &amp; we'll see him again at SS. Loved his rampage
@NewAgeInsiders Good show, thought the first two hours were terrific but the third hour dragged a little bit. Kalisto &amp; Neville were amazing
7/10
-Opening segment
-Bryan/Ziggler + Sheamus returns
-Kalisto shines in tag match
-Brock fucks up everyone
-Neville debut
-Cena/Ambrose
Athleticism is key, what a phenomenal display of work here by Neville. 


Sting takes out Bo Dallas as he interrupted him, but in the end Sting says he will take any opportunities WWE gives him. #RAW
Didn't like the way RAW ended, but overall it was a great show.
Come on Brock, show up
Reigns wins it for his team, still getting booed
The crowd popped for Show<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Not any kind of reaction for Roman.
So Rusev wins, no shocker. Think Reigns will be Ortons partner to set up the 6 man tag. #RAW
No Lana tonight, probably because of what happened last night. #RAW
Smackdown is going to be great this week. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Makes no sense for Ryback to be in this match, hope we see Brock kick everyones ass to end the show.
Pretty good match, giving the divas time will help because they can show what skill they have &amp; display it in the ring. #RAW
I love this crowd, never fail to amaze me. #RAW
When you realize your girl is on her period because you had the lights off.


Randy will probably be partners with Reigns, don't know who else though. #RAW
Love Rollins, he's going to be a great champ for this company. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders incredible match, the chemistry was there for them &amp; they connected for an amazing bout. Rusev will get his rematch at ER.
Incredible match between Dean &amp; John, this is why I love back &amp; forth matches. RAW has been just fantastic, still got 50 more minutes left!
Tremendous match between Ambrose &amp; Cena, still got more action left. #RAW
FUCK CENA KICKED OUT
Come on Dean

Damn.
#WWE #RAW
Deans last title reign as U.S. Champ was very boring, that's because he was in the Shield &amp; he was involved in other storylines. #RAW
Saxton went a little ahead of himself there. #RAW
IT'S AMBROSE YES
Honestly don't know who's accepting this challenge, Neville debuted &amp; Sheamus already returned. Don't have a prediction. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Terrific stuff, loved the way he performed &amp; how he was presented. If booked right, he'll be one guy we'll remember forever.
Definitely not surprised Cena is getting booed, "John Cena sucks"<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
When you realize WWEs commentary team will be back next week on #RAW. 
I love Wikipedia man<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #RAW 
ADRIAN NEVILLE IS FLYING HIGH BABY
GO NEVILLE GO
ITS NEVILLE HOLY FUCK
Feel so bad for Saxton, he's stuck alone doing commentary by himself &amp; that's an extremely hard job to do. I give him A LOT of credit. #RAW
Mizdow looks good without the Miz, he picks up the win &amp; he's so over with the crowd. Miz is still irrelevant to me &amp; that will never change
THE ENDING OF MICHAEL COLE! #RAW


Did someone say they needed a new commentator? #RAW 
Damn, Stephanie getting some heat off of her chest. #RAW
Can the NXT commentary team join us now? They're 10x better than the normal WWE commentary team. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders @MichaelCole <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Commentator, Broadcaster, Adult Virgin.

#BrockVsRol…

Is it bad I'm ok with that....
#RAW #WWE
@BrockLesnar THANK YOU for whipping out the commentary team, they're all horrendous at their job. #RAW
F5 to the camera man again!
And Steph suspends Brock
Imagine if Brock hit Steph with an F5, my god
HAAA THIS IS AWESOME
F555555
NOW THE CAMERA MAN!!
BOOKER T GOT FUCKED UP AS WELL OH MY
COLE IS DEAD
YES YES HURT COLE
OH SHIT OMG
OH SHIT BROCK IS ABOUT TO BEAT THE HELL OUT OF ROLLINS
Still hasn't hit me yet that Brock is about to wrestle on RAW for the first time in a DECADE. Let's go Rollins! #RAW
LOOK AT SETH
Big pop for Rollins!
Brock vs Rollins, here we go! #RAW
The match is starting now? The fuck
Neville vignettes, YES #RAW
Good match, Kalisto just stole the show man. He's a fantastic wrestler who has a bright future in WWE. #RAW
KALISTO IS SO OVER
WTF KALISTO HOLY SHIT
This crowd is awesome man, "New Day Sucks" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Best RAW after Mania moment ever. #RAW 
Kalisto is something else, holy shit
Love how NXT chants were surfing through the arena a minute ago. #RAW
LUCHA
@NewAgeInsiders Neville
The moment: Electric. 
The Rock, Ronda &amp;the WWE Universe: Magic. 
We're just gettin' started... 
Brock vs Seth will happen later on tonight! #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders WWE booked it the right way, he NEEDS this run as a heel. He looks utterly disgusting<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
#YouLookStupid @WWESheamus
Sheamus is new look is fucking hideous, but he made his presence known by attacking two faces &amp; he's back to his old heel days. #RAW
SHEAMUS IS BACK AS A HEEL, YES
Spectacular match between Bryan &amp; Dolph, the two guys have great chemistry together &amp; we need more matches like that on #RAW
THAT SEQUENCE

#RAW #WWE #ICTitle
THIS MATCH HOLY SHIT
JBL just botched<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That surfboard stretch by Bryan looked beautiful, pure technical wrestling. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Amazing promo. It's going to be great seeing Brock wrestle on RAW later on tonight, Seth will steal one tonight though.
Bryan vs Ziggler, this should be a fantastic bout. I HOPE this doesn't end with BNB interfering. #RAW
Pretty obvious that Sheamus will answer Cenas open challenge, but I think he'll be getting a pop instead of boos. #RAW
BRYAN VS ZIGGLER IC TITLE MATCH NEXT!
My god Brock is so over with the crowd tonight, love it. #RAW
BROCK LESNAR IS WRESTLING ON MONDAY NIGHT RAW TONIGHT FUCK YES
Steph crashing the party as usual
Paul Heyman is the greatest talker in WWE history, my god he's fucking phenomenal. #RAW
Heyman is just firing away tonight
Suplex City chants! #RAW
Brock is in his ring gear! Looks like he wants a fight. #RAW
Brock and Heyman to kick off RAW
MONDAY NIGHT RAW IS LIVE BABY!
Dead #SuplexCityBitch


Looks like Adrian Neville will debut on RAW tonight, hope he's used right &amp; doesn't fall in the shuffle with guys like Ryder, Fandango, etc.
@BestInTheGalaxy He beat the champ yesterday...
Holy shit, what a match this would be. Hope it happens. 
Charrotle will probably be brought up to the main roster, don't think Sasha will appear tonight though. She'll be called up later this year.
Tonights RAW is going to be marvelous, I can already tell.
With Sheamus returning tonight, I would love to see him come back as a heel &amp; attack Bryan because he wants that IC title. BOOK IT! @WWE
I'm excited for Bryans title reign as IC champ, there's PLENTY of guys that he can feud with over the title. So many great possible matches.
@DCMatthews_NAI I hope they get it right with him.
The IC title was relevant before Bryan winning it, but now it'll be like how it used to be when HBK, Bret Hart, &amp; Pat Patterson held it.
@DCMatthews_NAI like that &amp; that's hard to do once you're facing the deadman. But I see your point but what does he do know is the question
@DCMatthews_NAI That's true. All we got from him was a single response while building up this match, &amp; Bray showed he could carry a feud
@DCMatthews_NAI To me, I would've had Bray won. If we're talking "kayfabe" then Bray basically didn't accomplish anything but face taker.
@Humanipathic don't know how a story begins with Bray/Orton, but I'd like that feud.
@DCMatthews_NAI with their decision.
@DCMatthews_NAI Exactly. Even though I think he should've won, I can see why WWE didn't want Taker to lose &amp; they could've gone either way
@DCMatthews_NAI I agree. He needs to go on a rampage to show that even though he was defeated, he's still a dominant force in the company.
Don't know where Bray goes from here, wondering if he's written off TV for 2 weeks or he just starts to destroy everyone on the main roster.
Tonights RAW is going to be tremendous, it's always the night after WM that WWE provides us with a 10/10 show. I want to see one tonight.
A heel Ziggler feuding with Bryan over the IC title would be great. Their matches would be outstanding as well as their promos, gotta happen
@DCMatthews_NAI I think a mixed tag match because it'll be build up as a huge match because she's with Rocky, I'd prefer it as well.
Ronda Rousey &amp; the Rock were brilliant last night, I couldn't have asked for a better segment than that. Hope to see her in WWE one day.
The G.O.A.T.


"Let's see who makes it to the top first."-Seth saying who will win the WWEWHC first out of the 3 members of the shield, he did last night.
It still hasn't hit me yet that John Cena is the U.S. Champion, I wouldn't believe you if you told me that he'd be U.S. Champ in WWE in 2015
Went 3-6 in my predictions last night, don't care if I was wrong or right because in the end WM 31 is a Mania that was one of the best ever.
The reaction on Paige's face after her &amp; AJ won last night was priceless, she was crying of joy because she made it to the grandest stage.
All 3 members of the shield lost last night, but it was Rollins who ended up coming on top with his successful cash in. 3-1 at WM now.
Amazing. 
@NewAgeInsiders Top 5, it's arguable to put it in the top 3.
@NewAgeInsiders I think it is. Even though he's in good shape &amp; can still go, I think the ending to his match yesterday tells us he's done.
@BillNevilleNAI @NewAgeInsiders have a safe flight home, glad that you guys had a ton of fun.
@LiamNAI Be safe!
@WWERollins @TODAYshow You deserve it, hard work pays off.

#WrestleMania @WWEUniverse #WM31 
You guys were amazing throughout WM week, I couldn't ask for better coverage! Thank you so much. @BillNevilleNAI @NewAgeInsiders @LiamNAI
The moment that we were all waiting for, the FUTURE is now!


Orton did beat the WWE Champion, isn't he next in line for a title shot? I'm predicting that's what Randy's going to say tomorrow night.
@LesnarSupport Thanks man, Lesnar had a very strong performance tonight but it didn't end well. Happy for Seth though.
This is amazing. 
As I keep thinking, this years WM does rank in my top 5. MAYBE top 3, over thinking this PPV so much I might go back and watch it again.
Rollins vs Brock is going to be insane<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
WM 31 was a perfect 10/10, I can't believe what I just watched. EVERYONE doubted this Mania, but it turned out to be one of the best ever.

The POP Seth Rollins is going to get tomorrow night at #Raw is going to be insane.

#Wrestlemania
@NewAgeInsiders Match of the night was the main event, this WM was my 6th best. It was a phenomenal show, happy you were there live!
THE IRONY. #WrestleMania 
I FUCKING LOVE YOU @WWE
WrestleMania 31 &gt; WrestleMania 30.
@EthanPWT @LordRollins What a moment, man WWE could've have BOOKED that any better. What a main event.
@LordRollins @RawIsRollins LWAOSOSKSKAMAMSMAS

I'm going to be super pissed if Brock losses, look how he's dominating this match. #WrestleMania
Brock is busted wide open, damn. #WrestleMania
10 SUPLEXS &amp; 3 F5s, holy fucking shit
Why the fuck is Roman laughing, he's about to be dead in a couple of seconds. #WrestleMania
Incredible scene. #WrestleMania


I gotta give credit to Roman man, this guy is taking sucha beating right now. Could pay off at the end though. #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders #SuplexCityBitch is trending
I would be dead after that closethline. #WrestleMania
#SuplexCityBitch
@LesnarSupport Hope not
THATS 5 OMG
SUPLEX CITY BITCH<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
GERMAN SUPLEX
Brock is going to eat Roman alive
HEYMAN YOU FUCKING MONSTER
But Bray is still young &amp; has a long way to go in his career, plenty of opportunities will come around for him. #WrestleMania
I am very happy for Taker, the guy has gotten himself into phenomenal shape &amp; he got a win that means A LOT to him. #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders I am sorta shocked, I think that Bray did look strong but all of this momentum he had has just gone down the toilet.
With Taker winning, this means that Bray Wyatts momentum has just decreased HEAVILY to a new level of low. But, the deadman has risen! 22-1.
@Love2HulkSmash How happy are you?
Wow
WHAT A SCENE HOLY FUCK THIS IS INCREDIBLE
KICK OUT OMG
Wyatt is winning this thing
WYATT IS STILL ALIVE
CHOKE SLAM
Whoever had to make the booking decision on this match, I feel for you cause it must've been the hardest thing you have done. #WrestleMania
Bray just hurt himself, he's lucky it wasn't the ankle. #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders Looks amazing, never thought I'd see him like that ever again.
Taker looks like old American badass, wish he was in this good of shape during last years Mania. #WrestleMania
The Undertaker looks in great shape, man he's doing great so far. I would love for him to win, but Bray really needs this win. #WrestleMania
Taker looks PHENOMENAL, I've missed him so much. Man, I wish this match was really for the streak. Bray HAS to win. #WrestleMania
THE DEADMAN IS ALIVE!!
This Bray Wyatt entrance is incredible, what a way to come out. He looks absolutely ready, HERE WE GO! #WrestleMania
Oh hey @RusevBUL 
COME ON BRAY
That segment was tremendous and it wasted a lot of time, what a way to hype the crowd. #WrestleMania
WHAT A FUCKING SEGMENT
Rock unloads on HHH! ROUSEY takes a shot at him as well!
I fucking love the Rock, oh my god man<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
ROUSEY BOUTTA BEAT SOME ASS
STEPH SPITTING FIRE DAMN
Rousey is so fucking hot, God damn
HOLY SHIT RONDA IN A WWE RING OMG
ROUSEY IS GONNA FUCK UP STEPH
Steph taking shots at Rocky
ROCK AND HHH FACE TO FACE
WrestleMania isn't the same without the Rock, all time great. #WrestleMania
HOLY FUCK IT'S ROCKY BABY HES FUCKING HERE I HAVE CHILLS
THE ROCKKKKKK
Next years attendance is going to be 100,000 plus, man it's going to look phenomenal. #WrestleMania
Rusev/Cena was a fantastic match, back &amp; forth action that kept going &amp; didn't disappoint. Never thought I'd see Cena hold the US belt again
Next year WM is in Dallas Texas in Cowboys stadium! #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders Fantastic match, can't believe that Cena is now the U.S. Champion. Never thought I'd see this scene.
RUSEV KNOCKS DOWN LANA AND CENA HITS THE AA TO BECOME THE U.S. CHAMPION WOW
I swear to god Cena brings moves out of his ass when he needs to, that's what I like about him. #WrestleMania
@donang1120 Not trying to be funny, just seen it on Twitter.
LOOK AT RUSEV HOLY SHIT!
Rusev is phenomenal in the ring. #WrestleMania
Well, this explains itself. #WrestleMania 
If Cena wins: Brings prestigious to the U.S. title, &amp; it'll be relevant.
If Rusev wins: just beat an all time great, he's a legit superstar.
This crowd is fucking awesome
Wonder how WWE is going to have Cenas entrance be like. Don't think it'll top Rusevs. #WrestleMania
Don't think WWE could've done a better job by putting this Rusev entrance together, amazing. #WrestleMania
What a sick entrance for Rusev, holy shit!
LANA LOOKS FUCKING SEXY
WrestleMania 31 &gt; The Walking Dead. #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders It's been amazing, second half will be just as good.
Best match of the night has been Rollins/Orton so far, Sting/HHH has been the best story told.
@DCMatthews_NAI Been an incredible night.
@Onedayremains_ @NewAgeInsiders @DCMatthews_NAI He was great, he had an awesome performance tonight like no other.
SCENES if Rollins cashes in successfully against BROCK tonight. #WrestleMania
@DCMatthews_NAI True. But it still ticks me off thinking about that stat.
Just a reminder that MICHAEL COLE IS 1-0 &amp; STING IS 0-1 at WM, just let that sink in. #WrestleMania
AJ &amp; Paige win, decent match. #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders He looked pretty good considering his age, it's sad that he's 0-1 at WM.
@NewAgeInsiders Still can't get over what happened, such an incredible match &amp; scene. Sting should've won though.
Still can't believe what happened with Sting/HHH, it's incredible how both NWO &amp; DX were in the ring together 15 years later.
That's a horrible way to end this match, Sting should've won the match but I get why they'd give HHH the win. #WrestleMania

Incredible.

Sting LOSES to Triple H.

#Wrestlemania #StingVsTripleH
HHH wins, wow.
HE BROKE IT
BAT VS SLUDGE HAMMER
This is what you call WrestleMania, what a fucking scene. #WrestleMania
HE KICKED OUT HOLY FUCK
THE BEST OF ALL TIME

That's what you call an entrance, HHH looks fucking sick. #WrestleMania
HOLY SHIT LOOK AT TRIPLE H
Stings entrance was freaking great. #WrestleMania
Phenomenal. #WrestleMania


Surprised Sting vs HHH is next, way to early for it but I don't care here we go! #Wrestlemania
What a match, just brilliant. Even though Randy won, both guys put on a tremendous performance. #WrestleMania
WHAT A RKO HOLY FUCK OMG
HES GONNA DO IT
OMG HOLY FUCK
Seth Rollins is athletic ability is incredible. #WrestleMania
DDT to J &amp; J security! #WrestleMania
Let's go Rollins!
Rollins is wearing some sick gear, he looks great.
@NewAgeInsiders Great match, enjoyed it a tons.
That was a spectacular match, honestly could've have asked for more. Ladder matches will never disappoint, so many spots that were fantastic
YES!!!!!
BRYAN WINS BRYAN WINS
GO BRYAN GO
BULL HAMMER AFTER ANOTHER
WHAT A FUCKING MATCH
AMBROSE IS FUCKING BROKEN
HOLY SHIT
R-Truth can wrestle for his age, looks great. #WrestleMania
FLY DEAN FLY
Bryan has opened the last two WM, he'll probably win this match. #WrestleMania
YES YES YES
IT'S WRESTLE MANIA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

#WrestleMania #NAI 
@DCMatthews_NAI I know I deleted my tweet for that reason, lmaoo
Ladder match to kick things off, HERE WE GO! #WrestleMania
1-1 so far in my predictions, bullshit how Big Show won. #WrestleMania
But, Mizdow finally turned on the Miz &amp; they'll probably face off at Extreme Rules. #WrestleMania
I swear to god WWE is so fucking stupid.
Please have Mizdow win
MIZDOW TURNING ON MIZ!!!
COME ON MIZDOW
CESARO TAKES OUT KANE
Fuck the Big Show, I wanted a GTS. #Wrestemania
Lmaooo Bo Dallas<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Look at the teamwork from Miz &amp; Mizdow, MIZ is going to turn later though.
NO AXEL
Itami HAS to hit a GTS during the battle royal, man this crowd would go absolutely nuts! #WrestleMania
Bestie vs Bellas would be fun to watch, hope to see it one day. #WrestleMania
1-0 so far in my predictions, awesome tag match. #WrestleMania
For her age, Lita looks great. Happy to see her again. #WrestleMania
This tag match should've been on the main card, it was terrific. If anything, the divas match should've been on the pre-show. #WrestleMania
Cesaro and Kidd retain! #WrestleMania
@NewAgeInsiders Those are great seats, have fun man!
This tag match has been awesome, so much great spots &amp; good wrestling. #WrestleMania
Jey wasn't cleared to wrestle, that's why WWE pulled off that stunt. #WrestleMania
Feel bad for Kofi, his sister died earlier this morning &amp; he still has the will to come out here and compete. So much respect for him.
God damn Nattie looks fucking sexy, but I'm hoping for Cesaro &amp; Kidd to retain! #Wrestemania
FUCK #WrestleMania 
@LesnarSupport Lmaoo ok
One more hour!
@LesnarSupport You have sources? Doubt it<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@LesnarSupport We've been hearing it for a couple of days, lol.
Love the stage, looks amazing. #WrestleManiaKickoff 
Really hope we see Biker Taker tonight, what shock the hell out of Bray Wyatt. #WrestleManiaKickoff
WWE is promoting Taker vs Wyatt, seems like Bray is okay and ready to go. Thank god. #WrestleManiaKickoff
Two different types of people. #WrestleManiaKickoff 
A Phoenix Splash into an RKO would be phenomenal, good grief. #WrestleMania
STOOGES<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Oh my. #WrestleManiaKickoff 
Reigns vs Lesnar is suppose to go on for an hour with entrances &amp; obviously the match, that's way to long &amp; I don't like that tbh.
Lana looks stunning. #WrestleManiaKickOff
Lita will be on the pre show later on, that's great!
#WrestleManiaKickoff
@Onedayremains_ @DCMatthews_NAI @NewAgeInsiders Lmaooo true, but if anything WWE would probably have Rock face Taker for no odd reason.
Bray NEEDS this win more than anything else right now, he needs to perform tonight &amp; I think he'll be able to. Hope I'm right.
@NewAgeInsiders I'd have to go with what @DCMatthews_NAI said, have Reigns taken out backstage &amp; with no choice Taker vs Brock &amp; beats him

Keep it here, Be Heard
#WWE #WM31 #NAI
@DCMatthews_NAI You genius
I hope Wyatt is okay, he hurt his ankle while warming up in the ring hours before WM. He's gotta have a strong showing tonight, he MUST win.
WM Predictions:
Kidd &amp; Cesaro
Mizdow(eliminates Miz to win)
Bellas
Bryan
Rollins
Cena
Sting
Wyatt
Lesnar(Seth only cashes in if Reigns wins)
@LordRollins It won't hurt him as much as I think it would, but he should win. I don't see why he doesn't.
@LordRollins But if he losses and ends up cashing in successfully then I don't mind his loss.
@LordRollins I know he is, &amp; I think he should be. But him beating Orton tonight would help him because he beat the "viper"
@LordRollins prestigious title in WWE, I think Brock winning hurts him but if Reigns wins he'll cash in successfully.
@LordRollins I mean yeah, but he's a guy that should be a main eventer &amp; hold the WWE title. Not just have great matches &amp; not hold a..
@LordRollins But what if he doesn't cash in successfully? Or he doesn't even cash in, he needs to go over &amp; "steal" one from Orton.
I can't see Rollins losing tonight, I mean he hasn't gotten the upper hand on Orton ever since he returned. Plus, Seth needs this win badly.
@Oli_Row @Askxri Yes it will. During the last 30 minutes of the show it'll be like that.
This is how the stage will look when it's dark, gorgeous. #Wrestemania 
The amount of pressure on WWE superstars tonight is unreal, it's WM &amp; they really can't mess up. They have to go out there &amp; just WRESTLE.
Today's the day that Sting will finally wrestle in a WWE ring, no way he losses tonight.
@FightJackFight Has to be.
The Wyatt/Taker match has to be around 10 PM so it will be dark in Cali, their entrances are meant to be that way &amp; it can't be sky blue.
AJ/Paige vs Nikki/Brie could've easily been a match on RAW, it's nowhere near WM worthy. Gotta have that title defended next time at WM.
Punk return confirmed. 
There's a lot of people who are going to watch WM tonight that don't watch WWE, that's how big of a show it is &amp; what it means to people.
@LordRollins <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Imagine if these guys win the tag titles tonight on the pre-show, you'll hear not one single cheer. I'll be pissed. 
I really want Ambrose to win the IC title, but I don't think he will because WWE thinks Bryan will make it more relevant.
@NewAgeInsiders The ladder match or Orton vs Rollins.
The stage doesn't look so bad, I mean it's only an up close picture so we'll have to wait &amp; see how it looks on TV. 
@NewAgeInsiders Most excited for Wyatt/Taker and the IC title match.
Waking up and knowing that tonight is WrestleMania is the best feeling in the world.
Congratulations to Kevin Nash for being inducted into the HOF, Michigan is proud brother! Love that HBK is inducting him, all time favorite.
What a moment, "Macho Man" Randy Savage is finally inducted into the HOF! He truly deserves it, he's very missed &amp; it's sad that he's gone.
What a speech from Bryan, so emotional &amp; just wonderful. He couldn't have done a better job, just amazing. #WWEHOF
This HOF is going to take forever though, we're only in on the second speech. #WWEHOF
I never watched Larry Zbyszko, but I am amazed at how good his speech was and how much it means to him to be inducted, true legend.
I can't imagine the amount of boos Reigns is going to get tomorrow night, he's already got enough tonight at the HOF.

…
Being reported that Jim Ross might be coming back to WWE. I'd love that, he's 10x better than Cole &amp; he's the G.O.A.T. in that role.
@Schnazzy 8
Finn Balor is a flat out stud, his in ring gear looks fantastic, he's phenomenal in the ring, &amp; he's not that bad on the mic. Needs a manger
HOF tonight, going to be some great speeches &amp; some boring ones but overall it'll be a fun night.
@HEELZiggler Have you ever shit yourself during a match? #AskTheHeel
It's incredible to see Itami use the GTS to pick up the win last night, he should start using it more often because he'll get more pops.
So fucking excited for tomorrow, it's WRESTLEMANIA BABY!
@NewAgeInsiders Say bye to Jasons bank account

#WWE #WrestleMania 
I still want to see a fatal 4 way match for the divas title &amp; not a tag match. It'll be a better match &amp; the title is being defended.
WrestleMania 31 starts in just 30 hours!
@NewAgeInsiders You guys are awesome for posting a lot of videos on Instagram &amp; snapchat while you were at NXT, have fun at axxess!

#NXTSanJose #NXT #WWE
Eva Marie isn't hosting the HOF anymore, thank GOD.
Think WWE made a good decision by having Itami win the tourney last night. Balor shouldn't appear at WM yet, gotta be a relevant appearance.
Loved the bonus podcast, you guys are amazing for doing one while in Cali. Have fun at NXT, you guys deserve it. @NewAgeInsiders
WM weekend is just amazing, there's so many festivities &amp; events that seem so fun to attend &amp; it makes you want to go to a show so bad.
@NewAgeInsiders This montage of Jason asking questions is awesome &amp; hilarious, super excited Josh<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> &amp; you're only 13 years older than me
Haaa love that Charles Robinson intro @NewAgeInsiders
@AJamesK20 @Onedayremains_ @NewAgeInsiders @BillNevilleNAI DO IT
@NewAgeInsiders Roman Reigns is definitely not better than Daniel Bryan, just my opinion though. Podcast has been great so far!



#WrestleMania #WWE #WM31 #NAI #NAIpod 
Everyone head over to 

We're about to go LIVE!

#NAIPod #WWE #NAI #WrestleMania 
God damn everyone loves to hate on AJ, just because your favorite diva is going up against her it doesn't mean you have to feel offensive.
Won't be mad if Rusevs first loss comes to Cena on Sunday, he can easily win it back at Extreme Rules or the RAW after WrestleMania.
@NewAgeInsiders Can't wait to hear the podcast tonight, love seeing you guys having fun &amp; enjoying the WM experience!

@BenGingster Read my last tweet
@denise_lita That's part of the story to it, If we were talking kayfabe then Heyman knows Brock is nothing without him.
Heyman turning on Lesnar during Rollins is cash in would be astonishing, the two would be a new pair &amp; Rollins would be on top of the world.
"When I returned, I made it a goal to win the IC title. It's something I never did and I want to bring it's prestige back."-Daniel Bryan
@LesnarSupport True. But Dean is extremely over with the crowd &amp; with this win he'll have something to do other than lose singles matches.
@LesnarSupport I agree. I think that Ambrose SHOULD win the IC title but I think Bryan will. Hoping that Brock wins &amp; I think that he does
Just a reminder that all members of the Shield are 2-0 at WM, I only see one of them staying flawless after Sunday.
If you want to be apart of WM &amp; you can't be there in Cali this weekend, give the @NewAgeInsiders a follow! You won't regret it.

No one has YOU Better Covered ALL #WrestleMania Weeken…

Feel bad for Rey, he is now retiring &amp; is walking away from something he loves to do. I think it's the best thing for him to do as of now.
"You can't have fear about your body, you can't worry about what pain your body will go through while in the ladder match."-Daniel Bryan
Battle Royal will be on the pre-show instead of the main card, THANK GOD cause it's a waste of time. Important matches will get more time.
It's being reported that WWE wants Taker to have a retirement match at WM 32, but it all depends on what happens on Sunday.
If anyone should be hosting the HOF, it SHOULD be Renee Young. Eva Marie has no facial expression while she speaks, &amp; Renee is MUCH better.
@NewAgeInsiders Glad you made it to California safely.

Rollins will be the first ever WWE superstar to not cash in his MITB briefcase, that only happens if Brock wins IMO. I hope I'm wrong though

Taker getting himself into good shape &amp; I like it, unfortanuely he needs to lose this Sunday &amp; have 2 losses at WM. 
What amuses me about Brock signing is that the main event has gotten interesting &amp; unpredictable, that's how WrestleMania matches should be.

@LiamNAI Happy Birthday!
Even without the buildup we've been looking for throughout the road to this years WM, the card looks tremendous &amp; we're in for a treat.
NXT tonight!
@NewAgeInsiders I'm definitely calling in, excited for the podcast tonight!
I wanna see Bryan vs Brock at SummerSlam for the WWE title, but that leaves Rollins out of the picture. So many decisions WWE needs to make.
@sofdlovesbsb He will be champion until SS, then he'll drop the belt.
@sofdlovesbsb What is there for Brock to do in WWE other than be champ? With him signing a multi year deal then it looks like he'll win.
@sofdlovesbsb Plans change
Brock is my pick for the main event of WM 31, no cash in &amp; no Heyman turn.
Imagine WWE trolls us all &amp; has Roman beat Brock to become the new champ, imagine the amount of boos/shocked faces people will deliver.
I definitely don't see Rollins cashing in at WM, now I feel frightened that he'll cash in unsuccessfully. So many scenarios, so many...
Since Brock has now signed a multi year deal with WWE, I expect him to vs the Rock in the main event of WM 32. Sold out 100,000 strong.
@NewAgeInsiders I agree 100% but now the question is, when does Seth cash in &amp; when he does, is he successful or unsuccessful?
@NewAgeInsiders Now during #NAIPod you told me that you see Seth cashing in no matter who wins the belt at WM, are you sticking to that?
@NewAgeInsiders He's keeping the WWE championship, bad news for Rollins though.

#BrockLesnar #WM31 #WWE #UFC #WrestleMania

#WM31
The ending to RAW last night felt so childish, 2 grown men who were literally playing tug of war with the WWE TITLE. Make it realistic, @WWE
@NewAgeInsiders 30, 17, 23, 3, &amp; 21
Reigns needs new ring gear, the guy is still living in the days of the Shield &amp; that needs to change. As well as his music, it's gotta go.
Oh my. 
@NewAgeInsiders He was great on the mic last night, I think WWE has done a marvelous job on when to show Sting on WWE TV.

Will be $70-90 in USA. Can not believe 'fans' are grumbling at £19.9…
@NewAgeInsiders It was average. I've been hyped but last nights show didn't help me at all.
@WWE after seeing that ending, all I have to say is that you better have a tremendous ending to WM. Just put on a fabulous SHOW.
Why would WWE end RAW like that? Lame as hell
UH OH
Notice that Heyman wink, could be a sign of something just a thought of mine
@aTerraRyzing 5 of them
I never believed a word that came out of Paul Heymans mouth when he said Brock was going to beat Taker, incredible how things have changed.
LMFAOO Paul man
Reigns is about to get booed out of the building
That POP for Brock though! #RAW
Brock is going to absolutely batter Reigns once they start throwing punches, then come WM, Reigns will overcome &amp; dethrone the beast. #RAW
Time for the Brock &amp; Reigns to go face to face! #RAW
Ziggler super kickin everyone
Sheamus is coming out
Ziggler beats Bryan in an outstanding bout, fucking awesome. Would've had Bryan win though. #RAW
Super kick out of nowhere!
JBL needs to stop the farm animal jokes.
@WrestlingLAD are you on heroine?
Ambrose is the ref for this main event! #RAW
Don't think anyone would believe me if I told them a year ago where Daniel Bryan is today in WWE. #RAW
YES! YES! YES! YES!
Nattie is so fucking hot
@NewAgeInsiders Incredible, amazing work from Bray. We can expect a good match between him &amp; Taker and him standing tall at the end.
No way in hell Bray losses on Sunday, no chance. #RAW
That was a phenomenal promo, wow. #RAW
@BillNevilleNAI 21-2
Rusev gets the upper hand in his battle with Cena, probably foreshadowing when he losses this Sunday. #RAW
ITS CENA ITS CENA
Why is WWE having Rusev vs Swagger? No sense if having this match. #RAW
Well, the bull just pinned Natalya. #RAW
Axels reaction when Hogans music hit was priceless
Imagine Harper as the referee<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Loved the brawl between AJ &amp; Paige, like how it was set up rather than having AJ screw Paige. #RAW
Isn't that suppose to be a DQ? Good match though, action was intense &amp; fast pasted. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders It's been decent, want to see more matches &amp; buildup to WM.
AJ will screw Paige &amp; it'll turn into a fatal four way instead of a tag match, easy to predict. #RAW
Predicting we get a fatal four way match for the divas title at WM rather than a tag match, makes more sense &amp; it's the best possible match.
Tag match was alright, Rollins will go over at WM. #RAW
"Orton will finally get his hands on Rollins" hey WWE, you remember when he attacked Rollins?
I want to see more wrestling in the second hour of #RAW
Boring tag match, rally no point of it. #RAW
The Ascension are alive? #RAW
Sandow is my pick to win the Battle Royal this Sunday, by eliminating Miz to win the whole thing. #RAW
That video package of Roman vs Brock is fantastic, pumped for Sunday! #RAW
Renee is a great broadcaster, cannot wait to hear her on commentary one day. #RAW
It's obvious we're gonna see Orton face Seth &amp; J &amp; J security. #RAW
Fun tag match, ladder match should be great at WM. #RAW
I just hate listening to Michael Cole speak. #RAW
Ambrose &amp; Harper are magic in the ring together. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Brilliant segment. Sting was terrific on the mic &amp; I loved how he blocked the slap from Steph.
Brilliant way to open RAW, the crowd was hot and the scene we witnessed in the ring was epic. Two legends. #RAW
WHAT A SCENE
OH MY GAWHD, OH DONT DO IT
HHH BOUTTA THROW STRAIGHT BOMBS
OH SHIT
Steph is a great heel, she easily has the best mic skills from all the women in WWE. #RAW
This crowd is hyped already, love it! #RAW
It's Sting! #RAW
The #RAW go home show before WM starts now!!
@NewAgeInsiders Lesnar gets the upper hand in a brawl him &amp; Reigns end up getting into when they go face to face. I want more buildup to WM.
Dean SHOULD win the IC title but I think WWE wants to give it to Bryan cause they think he'll bring prestigious back to it, sounds dumb IMO.
Oh, if Reigns wins you're going to stop watching WWE? Let me know what you think of RAW the night after WM.
Reigns is improving but he isn't ready to hold the companies prestigious title yet, I still wanna see more of what Roman can provide US with
@NewAgeInsiders He only cashes in if Reigns wins the belt, he HAS to be SUCCESSFUL if he chooses to do so. He is WWEs next guy.
If WWE signs Brock, he isn't dropping the title cause they'll be nothing else for him to do. He would at least hold it until SS if he stays.
Congratulations to Kevin Nash for being inducted into the WWE HOF. Hell of a career, excited to hear his HOF speech.
RAW needs to be excellent tonight, it's the go home show for WM &amp; we need a hyped/intense show to get people more excited for Sunday.
Before I die, I wanna attend a WrestleMania. It's worth the money, you can count on WWE putting on a hell of a show.
Takers last match should be next Sunday, after that, he gets inducted into the 2016 HOF. Hard to see him go but it's best for his health.
The greatest match I have ever watched was Taker vs HBK at WM 25, don't know how it didn't end the show.
1 week until WM!
#RIPPerro
@LordRollins Happt Birthday, enjoy it man.
Who has the heart to make this meme, not even funny. 
A feud is needed between Bryan &amp; Ziggler after WM. Dolph needs to turn heel as well, my gosh their matches would be brilliant.
Rock is hinting the possibility that he will face Brock at WM 32, if he suggests it then I think that Vince would totally make it happen.
I'm very excited for Sting/HHH, build up hasn't been great but for how it's been I'm hyped! Sting looks in great shape &amp; that's a key thing.
To entertain/wow US. I wanna see you wrestle in a ring cause you wouldn't last more than 2 minutes, it's PRO wrestling for a reason. (2/2)
It annoys me when people say wrestling is fake/easy to perform, no it's not, those men/women put their bodies on the line every night (1/2)
@NewAgeInsiders Punk/Cena/Rock for WWE title at WM 29, Taker beats Brock, HBK beats Cena at WM 23, Bray beats Cena, and Booker T beats HHH.
Perro Aguayo Jr died after an in-ring spot with Rey Mysterio, just terrible &amp; devastating. Wrestling is still fake, right people?

#FF @NewAgeInsiders @DCMatthews_NAI @isTrask @LordRollins @seethekidwin @Schnazzy @BaneofWrestling @BillNevilleNAI @Rampaigedx @Balor_Club1
@NewAgeInsiders I'd say Taker if he is done but this year. If not, I think Y2J &amp; Sable should be getting in early as possible.
This is fucking sick 
Would rather have the divas match at WM be for the title, a tag match is really not needed but it is what it is. Should've been Nikki/Paige.
Being positive during WM season is important cause it's a time where us WWE fans should be excited cause it's the biggest event of the year.
Feel like no one is talking about how great Rusev/Cena will be, has a good story behind it &amp; both guys are amazing wrestlers that'll deliver
@NewAgeInsiders Lesnar/Bryan, Rhodes/Goldust retirement match, Shield triple threat match for the IC title.

@NewAgeInsiders Thanks!

Head to the New Look 

#BrockLesnar, Fans at #RAW, …
Amazing show, thanks for having me on tonight guys! @NewAgeInsiders
Next weeks show for NXT is going to be fantastic, especially Balor vs Owens.

Head to the New Look 
Excellent match between Owens &amp; Riley. Balor gets his hands on Owens after the match, great way to end the show. #NXT
Been a lot of good matches tonight on #NXT, can't wait for this main event!
Alexia Bliss is smoking hot, man. #NXT

Head to the New Look 

#NAIPod htt…
If Brock has really signed, he keeps the title. If he doesn't, Reigns wins it.
This could change a whole lot in the upcoming months. 
Kurt Angle is a top 3 wrestler in WWE history, man was he something in the ring. Wish he'd come back and have one more match with WWE.
No one has ever cashed in at WM before, I hope Rollins is the first to do it &amp; I hope he's actually successful while attempting it.
@NewAgeInsiders Pathetic, don't see how it affects the WWE in anyway if they wear a costume.
NXT becoming its own promotion instead of being apart of WWE would be great, wouldn't mind it at all if it happened.
@BalorGuy @Balor_Club1 Non wrestling fans won't tune in to see a guest host, really wasting 3 hours of their lives.
@__aliciaperez__ A big purple jacket
That guy sitting in the front row was forced to change his outfit last night because it was "distracting" ridiculous to be honest.
Hell no. 
@NewAgeInsiders Above average show. The ending was fantastic &amp; so was the Heyman/Roman segment. Rusev/Cena was alrigh, could've been better.
Above average RAW, 6/10
-Divas match
-Brock interview
-Heyman/Reigns segment
-6 man tag match
-Main Event
Gotta give it up to Sting, he looks in great shape right now &amp; I've said in the past I don't think he'd be ready to fight at WM 31. #RAW
RKO
GET IN THERE HHH
HOLT SHIT WHAT A SCENE
STING IS HERE
@Humanipathic Exactly.
Brilliant swerve by the authority!
WWE is obviously going to save this match for WM
So WWE wants to have Snoop Dog &amp; Bill Simmons on RAW next week &amp; instead of that they can use that time to build up storylines for WM. #RAW
@Humanipathic He needs to end his wrestling career at WM but losing, if he wins then why not come back for more? Needs to retire after WM 31
Imagine if Bray was the one to break the streak, has the perfect story and makes the most sense. #RAW
There is no way in hell Bray loses, it just can't happen. If he wins which he should, Taker shouldn't wrestle ever again after that. #RAW
I truly believe that in 13 days we will all witness the Undertaker wrestle his final match for WWE. #RAW
This video package
Rollins cashes in successfully at WM &amp; the authority is crawling back to him, he says no &amp; is full of himself till someone can stop him.
Loving this storyline with Seth right now, everyone is leaving him on his own &amp; he has to prove he can stay on top. Leading to a cash in.
ROLLINS SPITTING FIRE
@NewAgeInsiders Terrific match. Ambrose really needs it, he hasn't had a big pin ina while. Think it's Deans time to shine, hope it is.
What a match, just incredible. This IC title match is looking like it will be the best match of the night &amp; it has had the best buildup.
3 BULL HAMMERS
Bryan gets the hot tag!
What an awesome tag match, everyone was bitching about how stupid it was going to be. #RAW
Would love to see a Ziggler or Ambrose heel turn on Bryan so they feud after WM. #RAW
Lmaoo I love the role R-Truth is in right now, gives the guy something to do &amp; he's pretty good at doing his job. Great on commentary. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Heyman was amazing. Roman is improving, like it. Right now I'm 60/40 on Reigns leaving San Fran with the belt. #RAW.
I don't want Roman in the main event, but I have to deal with it. I'm all on board if he just improves on what he needs to work on. #RAW
Reigns has improved on the mic &amp; I like it, the Daniel Bryan chants were really not needed. Let the guy talk, he's improving. #RAW
I agree 100% with the sign in the back. #RAW 
The more I listen to Paul Heyman, the more I'm convinced Brock retains his championship and stays with WWE. #RAW
Cole needs to shut the fuck up
ITS PAUL HEYMAN BABY
Still think Sandow is winning the Battle Royal
This battle royal at WM is going to be a bathroom break, literally no point in having it occur. #RAW
Think this years HOF has a weak class, could've been better. #RAW
When the Usos were champs everyone was dying to see Kidd &amp; Cesaro become champs, now they're complaining about them &amp; want new champs. Lol
Fuck the Big Show
Love when Lesnar is talking in an interview, no pressure and he just lets out whatever the hell he has on his chest. Great promo. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders No. I just don't see him &amp; Vince agreeing on a deal, but I'm 60/40 on him leaving.
"If I stay, I'm still going to be WWE Champion. If I leave, I'm still going to walk out being WWE Champion."-Brock Lesnar
Rollins is on the path of being on his own, think that's leading him to cash in successfully at WrestleMania. #RAW
J &amp; J QUIT
I have the same amount of WrestleMania wins as Los Mataordes. #RAW
Well, that tag match escalated quickly. #RAW
All I gotta say is that Cena nailed that promo but Rusev really needs Lana at his side when cutting a promo. #RAW
#SaveUsLana
LMAOOO JBL MOCKING THE RUSEVS ATTORNEY
Booker and JBL just fucking with Rusevs attorney
Rusevs attorney can't speak proper english, nice going WWE. #RAW
We want Lana!
Rusev is wearing shoes? That's a first. #RAW
Contract signings never end in brawls, said no one ever. #RAW
How long does WWE want us to wait until Sheamus returns, bring the guy back already and make sure he's a fucking heel. #RAW
If Sandow doesn't end up winning the battle royal by eliminating Miz, then I don't know what the fuck WWE was doing with those two guys.
Miz hits the skull crushing finale to Mizdow, heat. #RAW
Still can't believe till this day that the Miz beat John Cena in the main event of a WM. #RAW
"Ryback looks so good man" -Booker T

Booker, I hope you know he's taking his vitamins. #RAW
@NewAgeInsiders Good match, surprised WWE gave them 11 minutes. Proud of the divas for actually showing what they can bring to the table.
Good divas match. Hey @WWE, see what your divas can do if given time? Be sure to keep that in the back of your mind. #RAW
Michael Cole is 1-0 at WrestleMania, just let that sink in. #RAW
Think this commercial break has been on longer then this divas match. #RAW
Nikki has improved from how bad she was a couple of years ago, deserves more credit. #RAW
I mean yeah Rollins &amp; Orton both had good promos, but why waste 15 minutes on one segment to open the show? How about a match instead. #RAW
Waste 15 minutes for a fucking segment that has to do with a promo, typically WWE.
Why in fucks name is Orton/Rollins happening tonight?
Fucking Big Show. #RAW
Looks like we'll be seeing Lesnar for the final time at RAW before &amp; after WM. I think it will be before he heads over to UFC.
When someone is hating on another diva they just want to get that divas fan base pissed off, it's not that hard to figure out. Common sense
Rock &gt; Hogan.
#RAW tonight!
@NewAgeInsiders HBK (12) Taker (29) Flair (24) HHH (30) Cena at 23 was amazing. Think Bray will have the best entrance at 31
It would be such a spectacular moment if Rollins cashed in on Brock if he retained his championship, it would be a much better outcome.
Austin 3:16
@NewAgeInsiders Great podcast. Loved the topic about Taker, having his last match at this years Mania is the right way to go.
Funny how people think Seth Rollins is overrated, one of the best wrestlers in the world today &amp; his mic skills are excellent as well.
WrestleMania 23 &gt; WrestleMania 29.
@RawIsRollins Took you 40 years
Announcing his entry into the ladder match. 
My bad guys
@LordRollins Sorry I got hacked... I'm not gay lol
People are wasting their time tweeting #GiveDivasAChance because nothing is going to change, Vince still has the final say in everything.
This week on twitter: 22 new followers, 17 new unfollowers  and followed One person  via 
I want Taker to announce his retirement at WM. One because that one show every year is part of his legacy &amp; he won championships there too.
Think Reigns/Brock won't be that good, I can think of 4 matches on the card that'll be better.
No surprise WWE didn't go forward with the Dust bros feud, when they have the opportunity to book something great they simply don't do it.
Feel like nothing will compare to the build/hype to last years WM main event, it was perfect &amp; executed right. It was fucking phenomenal.
@NewAgeInsiders The build up to WM 30 was better than the build to 31. Think it had better storylines/hype to the show, 31 won't be better
LOL 
@heisenbergbad nah
WWE &gt; TNA.
@BaneofWrestling Heard he's not
Looks like we'll see Brock in UFC after WM, sad (to some) but true. His presence in WWE is is relevant cause he's BOX OFFICE.
Rusev vs Cena is going to be marvelous at WrestleMania.
#FF @NewAgeInsiders @DCMatthews_NAI @isTrask @LordRollins @seethekidwin @BaneofWrestling @Schnazzy @RawIsRollins @BillNevilleNAI @EthanPWT
Think Itami is lost right now, his debut was exciting &amp; great but now he hasn't done anything major in NXT.
@NewAgeInsiders Sandow will probably turn on Miz during the battle royal. A match would've been better
Done with finals, only 12 weeks left of school.
NXT wasn't so bad today, next week should be fun as Riley takes on OWENS &amp; Banks takes on Bliss.
@WinSamiWin @Roonofhonor Nevermind then.
@WinSamiWin @Roonofhonor Could be, we'll find out tomorrow.
This is a look at Smackdown from last night, just ridiculous at the amount of empty seats there is in this picture. 
@MhdAkmall Well because he was in the shield during that time &amp; he was involved in other storylines at the time.
@MhdAkmall Not everyone gets their moment year after year. His surgery was a key cause off of it.
After WM 31, Bray Wyatts first two opponents were Taker &amp; Cena. That's just incredible, but he can't take a loss to Taker on March 29.
The authority need to be gone after WM, I don't mind HHH &amp; Steph running the show but I hate how Kane &amp; the Big Show are in the group.
@NewAgeInsiders It should be a two hour show. The more time they get, the more time they have to show other wrestlers that are talented

Heyman's #WrestleMania Prediction, #ConnorTheCrusher, #ROH Losing Top Stars &amp; MORE

#WWE
h…
@MhdAkmall Wouldn't have Bryan as champ, Rusev can't face Reigns after he drops title to Cena. Like orton &amp; Ziggler vs authority.
@MhdAkmall Reigns wasn't so bad as I thought he'd be, gotta give some credit to him.
@MhdAkmall boo*
@MhdAkmall Yeah they can noo all they want because Rollins will cash in after the match.
@MhdAkmall Bryan doesn't need the IC title, fans will be happy if Ambrose or Ziggler win as well.
@MhdAkmall It's to show that Rusev is actually legit &amp; not a fluke, for fucks sake he beat JOHN CENA (that's if he does)
@MhdAkmall power in the match. The contestants in the match are all good/underused wrestlers &amp; a ladder match fits them perfectly.
@MhdAkmall Not really a waste for Bryan, the IC title is a prestigious title &amp; it's making it's case by having a great build &amp; it has star
@MhdAkmall Slow? Are you on drugs? Roman is young &amp; athletic, Brock could go at a fast paste if he wants to.
@MhdAkmall I thought you said Bryan sucks? Oh, &amp; HHH can carry Sting. It won't be a 5 star match but Sting is in good shape for his age.
@MhdAkmall Their match at Fast Lane was great, it's going to be terrific at WM. Cena winning the U.S. title doesn't sound right at this time
@MhdAkmall Wyatt is a very good wrestler. The buildup to the match has been excellent &amp; Wyatt can carry him.
@MhdAkmall First of all, how can you not like the matches on the card? They look stellar, some build up hasn't been great but it's fine, kid
"There's no built to any of the WM matches" the IC title match, Brock/Reigns, Cena/Rusev, Bray/Taker. Sting/HHH has been meh.
Don't know why people are complaining about the card for WM 31, I honestly think it has the potential to be one of the best manias ever.
So Stardust is in the ladder match, don't understand why Bryan isn't in it yet. He'll probably get added later on though.
So many moves in the NFL, loving it. #FreeAgentFrenzy
Exactly a year ago today, THIS happened. 
Vince McMahons response to the #GiveDivasAChance trend. 
SmackDown is in Detroit tonight, I would've went but something came up.
@WadeBarrett D TOWN
RAW was average tonight, 5/10.
-IC title build up
-Heyman Promo
-Rusev/Cena brawl
-Wyatt/Taker segment
-Orton attacking Rollins
@NewAgeInsiders It was alright, could've been better. Heyman was phenomenal, Taker/Bray segment was amazing. Cena was good &amp; Orton was great
That was great.
RKO!
NVM
THE PUNT
The viper strikes again!
I want ORTON to do the punt so bad
Orton turns face and Reigns wins the match with a spear! #RAW
The double middle fingers!
Ortons gotta turn
@NewAgeInsiders Very excited for WM. It was just a tremendous segment that didn't even need Takers face to show. Bray HAS to win.
@NewAgeInsiders Now that I think about it, Bray Wyatt should've broken Takers streak.
I really don't know who wins, Taker or Wyatt
That's a way to not show Takers face, fantastic way to answer Wyatts challenge. #RAW

#WWE #RAW #WM31
What in fucks name
HESSSSSSSS BAAAAACKKKKKKK
HOLY FUCK GET OUT HERE TAKER
OMG
There's no way Taker doesn't appear
@LiamNAI This
COME ON TAKER

#Goosebumps #RAW
If taker shows up then I think everyone's opinion would change on how RAW turned out tonight.
SAVE US BRAY
What the fuck is up with WWE tonight?
JBL NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT CENA GOING TO MANIA WE ALREADY KNOW THAT
The sound guy forgot Los Matardores is song<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Punk chants
Uh, what just happened in the span of 2 minutes?
Don't get why the New Day would win
Rusev really pissed at Lana, interesting way to write Lana off would be him getting sick and tired of her. #RAW
That Mania promo match for the main event is sick
That Wyatt segment though
If Cena wins the US title &amp; brings back the spinner, I'll be extremely happy. #RAW
Cena really wants that U.S. title, he forces Lana to make it official! #RAW
Rusev is out!
HERE WE GO
Will Lana leave Rusev? She's suppose to leave soon to film her movie. #RAW
Well, that escalated quickly. #RAW
I'm really nervous right now, Axel shouldn't be the one to pin Rusev. Gotta be someone bigger &amp; who has a brighter future. #RAW
That Cena promo was great!
Awesome video package, can't wait for Sting &amp; HHH to go one on one. #RAW
AJ beats Summer and the amount of TV time they got was 3:05. WIZ got more than them, lol.
Evas boobs are ginormous.
Wiz got 5 minutes to perform, let's see how much time the divas get next. #RAW
LMFAOOO Sandow
I come back and he's still performing, oh my. #RAW

#WWE #WizDowWasFunnyThough 
Time for me to take a Wiz!!
WIZDOW OMG
@NewAgeInsiders He is just phenomenal. I was shocked he mentioned UFC even though I had it mind, best promo I've heard since 2011.
That Paul Heyman promo was the best promo I've ever heard since Punks pipe bomb, no arguments whatsoever. #RAW
Paul Heyman is simply the best on the microphone in WWE today, this is just fucking phenomenal. #RAW
If only Heyman mentions Punk
OH MY FUCK PAUL HEYMAN
I TOLD YOU GUYS!!!! @NewAgeInsiders
HE MENTIONED UFC WHATTT
OH MY GOF
OH SHIT HEYMAN SPITTING FIRE
I think Heyman is foreshadowing SETH cashing in. #RAW
I can listen to Paul Heyman for hours and hours
The beast is finally here!
If you're saying negative comments about Connor, you're just a sick person. #RAW
Unforgettable. #RAW 
RIP Connor, you'll be remembered forever buddy. #ConnorTheCrusher #RAW
Whoever is booking this IC storyline is brilliant, kudos to them. #RAW
R-Truth is such a troll
I love this IC title storyline
LMFAOOO TRUTH
Ambrose wins in a good match, he's running away with the title! #RAW
Don't want Stardust in the ladder match, prefer Bryan in it instead. #RAW
Congrats to Connor for making the HOF! Wish he was alive to celebrate his induction, so sad to see him die at such an early age. #RAW.
BNB hits a cheap shot on Bryan after the match, then Ambrose comes to save the day and he has a match next! #RAW
Bryan wins!
Can the commentary team call the match? BNB is facing Daniel Bryan for fucks sake. #RAW
YES YES
LMFAOOOO SETH
SETH ROLLINS IS BRILLIANT
That Benoit sign!
If AJ was in the title match, everyone would be bitching about it. Take what you get people, the card is already stacked enough.
@NewAgeInsiders Have Taker show up at least once before WM, Lesnar &amp; Reigns gotta brawl on the go home show. Turn Orton face.
A fatal 4 way match for the divas championship would've preferable, but I think WWE would've gave AJ the belt right back &amp; I don't want that
So, the Bellas will face Paige &amp; AJ at WM. Seems like the twins are staying after all, could be done at the end of this year though.
Best buildup to a WM streak match. 
Surprised that the Bella Twins removed WWE from their bio, If they were leaving they would've already left the company.

#RAW #NAI
@NewAgeInsiders Don't get me wrong, I like Axel &amp; all but he shouldn't be the first person to pin Rusev.
@NewAgeInsiders Is this for the title? If so, I don't think Axel wins because Rusev &amp; Cena need to finish off their feud at WM.
So intrigued to hear about what the all talent meeting is about later on today.
This week on twitter: 32 new followers, 21 new unfollowers  and followed 15 people via 
@HEEL_BLC It doesn't make any sense because she's still holding the title.
Nikki is still divas champ and she's not even defending the title at Mania, they probably did re sign.
They re signed don't worry
This last episode of #TotalDivas was okay, hoping this next one is great. #TotalDivas
I hate it when people tweet things like "RT for this person or fav for this person" it's obvious that you're striving for favorites and RTs.
Lmaooo @ Rosa #TotalDivas
@TraskVancity I've seen this match, I imagine it to be just as good if they faced off today.
Bryan vs AJ Styles = PHENOMENAL
Finn Balor &gt; Adrian Neville.
Paige &amp; Naomi having series of matches would be amazing, especially if they were fighting for the divas championship. I wanna see it soon.
It's unbelievable that WrestleMania 31 is just 21 days away, it was just like yesterday that we were all prepared for Rock vs Cena part 2.
It's going to be sad to know that Roman Reigns will main event a WM &amp; CM Punk hasn't.
@NewAgeInsiders @TheD_Generation To me, he's like an old Ziggler &amp; Vince doesn't want any of that.
@NewAgeInsiders Tyler Breeze. He's lost at the moment &amp; I think HHH has ran out of options in terms of how to book/do with him.
CM Punk is BETTER than you
Kane needs to retire as soon as possible, he's had a terrific career &amp; his legacy can't be ruined much longer. Needs to call it quits soon.
If you're going to injure 31 wrestlers, don't deny it because you'll get yourself into more trouble than you already are, idiot. @BillDeMott

#WrestleMania #NAI 
Can't wait until the day HHH gets the final say in everything, it's better for the future &amp; his knowledge of wrestling is incredible.
NXT is fucking awesome.
Loving the improvement of Smackdown, ever since moving to Thursday it has been far more interesting &amp; actually must see lately.
Looks like Stardust will be involved in the IC title ladder match, I would imagine Goldust gets into it too. If true, there's 8 guys in it!
#FF @NewAgeInsiders @LordRollins @DCMatthews_NAI @TraskVancity @seethekidwin @EthanPWT @RawIsRollins @xRRNR @Schnazzy @Onedayremains_
Ambrose is bound to win the IC title at WM. His time is coming up &amp; he needs this win, no one else needs it more than him right now, IMO.
Randy Orton vs Seth Rollins is going to be tremendous at WrestleMania 31, could be the best match of the night behind the ladder match.
SummerSlam 2013 was marvelous. But, last years SS was shit compared to the one from 2013. This year I expect huge things from Brooklyn.
@NewAgeInsiders He will get involved in the match someway somehow, but I don't want to see him lose his briefcase &amp; not capture the title.
@NewAgeInsiders The only way I see it happening is if Reigns doesn't go over, just a thought though.
@NewAgeInsiders I can't see that either, but in "kayfabe" he just left because there's no one else that's worthy of facing him.
@NewAgeInsiders the WWE title. I love wrestling tourneys, I wouldn't mind one right after WM.
@NewAgeInsiders True. But if he leaves out the UFC part then I think that would be a good way to walk out, then we see a tournament for
@NewAgeInsiders he's leaving the WWE cause no one can beat him/deserves a shot at him. Also, he could mention Brocks leaving for UFC. (2/2)
@NewAgeInsiders I wanted to touch up on something, what if Brock beats Roman &amp; him &amp; Paul come out the next night on RAW &amp; say that (1/2)
@NewAgeInsiders Good match, they reached their expectations on what kind of match we were looking for. WWE won't have it on RAW till 2017
@NewAgeInsiders Terrific podcast, love the new format to NAI right now.
Dying at how Liam says can you give us Bull Dempsys best 5 matches<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @NewAgeInsiders

#WWE #WrestleMania #NAI


Great match, good call by having Sasha retain the belt. #WWENXT
March 25th is the next NXT Special Event!
There's a difference between HHH &amp; Vince, Vince gives his divas 29 seconds on RAW &amp; HHH gives his divas the MAIN EVENT on #NXT.
I think Crowe needs a better finisher, I know it's his still his debut but that should be changed. #NXT
Crowe wins! #NXT
Love how Riley is getting in the ring again, the tension with him and Owens is great. #NXT
Sami Zayn had a strong promo from hos video clip, hope to see him soon in NXT again.
THIS RILEY AND OWENS BEEF
Baron Corbin is a stud
Blake and Murphy just have it to easy for them, easy win for them. #NXT
Tyler Breeze picks up the easy win, decent match. #NXT
#NXT
2 minutes until NXT!
Just finished watching last weeks NXT, pretty good match from the divas &amp; the main event was great. Charlotte/Banks tonight will be amazing.
WrestleMania 31 is shaping up to be one outstanding PPV, the matches on the card look so good &amp; I'm hoping they will deliver.

We're Talkin #ROH13, #WrestleMania 31, &amp; More with YOU!

Get YOUR Calls Ready!
Be H…

We're on the Road to Mania &amp; Taking YOUR Calls! h…

#NAIPod #WWE #WM31 
@NewAgeInsiders Bryan/HBK, Rollins/Rock, Punk/Bret, SCSA/Hogan, &amp; Rock/HBK. I wanna see Owens/Brock &amp; Bryan/Brock.
@Wrestle_React Very good show, enjoyed it a ton. Going to watch some of the matches you guys suggested.
@NewAgeInsiders Roman vs Rollins was good. Heyman just killed it out there &amp; was the best thing about tonight, Mania is only 27 days away!
6.5/10 #RAW
-Heyman promo
-Bray promo
-IC title build up
-Cena/Steph segment
-BNB/Dean match
-AJ return
-Main Event
Great way to end RAW, that dive by Reigns was fantastic.
WHAT A SPEAR TO ROLLINS HOLY SHIT
WHAT A DIVE BY REIGNS HOLY SHIT
ROLLINS WINS!
Heyman was the best part about RAW tonight, no arguments. #RAW
PAUL HEYMAN IS A FUCKING GENIUS
Heyman addressing the Brock rumors!
@RickVelazquez96 Never heard of her, being honest.
Who the hell is this diva
Decent match, love the way they ended this segment after the match.
Finally Bryan is wrestling next!!
That Jon Stewart segment wasn't so bad as I thought it would be, I was entertained. #RAW
HAAA ORTON
Jon Stewart knows his damn wrestling.
Jon Stewart showing up to Seth Rollins!
Eh this segment
Paige beats Nikki by a DQ, AJ then comes to save the day and her and paige clear the ring! #RAW
I'm hoping this is a 10-15 minute match. #RAW
That was a terrific segment. #RAW
Lmfaoo HHH is such a troll
What the fuck
HHH!
Come on Rusev
Cena boutta beat some ass
LETS GO AXEL
Axel vs Cena coming up next!
AXELMANIA CHANTS
Stephanie making a damn statement. #RAW
Cena spitting fire
Cena acts so shocked when someone interrupts him, glad it's Stephanie though. #RAW
Intrigued to see what impact Sheamus makes whenever he returns. #RAW
RAWs been a little rusty thus far, but we gotta remember that it's only been an hour. #RAW
Decent match, like the tension at the end. #RAW
@ErikVanDjismie yes
@NewAgeInsiders He's amazing. I think that's the direction where we're heading, but I have questions regarding that stipulation.
If you're complaining about this last segment with Bray Wyatt then there's gotta be something wrong with you, that was just brilliant. #RAW
Bray Wyatt is the G.O.A.T.
Gasoline, ladies and gentleman
Bray Wyatt is phenomenal
But honestly, this Sandow/Miz feud has been gold. Need to have a match at WM. #RAW
If anything, The Miz is nothing without Sandow but<FROG FACE><HOT BEVERAGE>️ #RAW
GET HIM SANDOW
TV-14 ALERT
This commercial<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
So far we have Ambrose, Truth, BNB, &amp; Harper in the IC title ladder match at WM as if it looks right now. Probably add 4 more guys. #RAW
Love how Harper is now involved in this storyline. Pretty good match, Dean steals the victory off the distraction. #RAW
Ambrose vs BNB, this is going to be fun. #RAW
Orton getting in Rollins is head, love it.
No surpassed Roman got the upper hand in that little brawl. #RAW
ROLLINS IS FORESHADOWING OMG
Lmfaoo at the Punk chants.
Seth Rollins will simply wrestle rings around Reigns, it's a landslide when you're comparing these two in the ring. #RAW.
TIME FOR MONDAY NIGHT RAW
Nikki vs Paige is set to take place tonight and it's for the Divas Championship, interesting.
30 minutes... #RAW
Yes WWE should give the divas a chance but if they aren't good enough to get the amount of TV time that's acceptable then don't be bitchy.
I'm hoping we see a good RAW tonight, I'm not in the mood to sit through a boring ass 3 hour show tonight.
Would love to see AJ return tonight, but I don't want her to be champ right away. There's other divas ahead of her that deserve it more.
@LesnarSupport I am one of those WWE fans.
Wiz shouldn't be a guest host on RAW next week, it's not anything special &amp; they need to focus on other things like building up feuds for WM
@DCMatthews_NAI Eh it could. I personally don't want to see it.
@DCMatthews_NAI It's honestly stupid IMO, Rollins just needs to be on tac with Orton since they're suppose to feud.
Why in fucks name is Jon Stewart appearing on RAW tonight? Meaningless guest host that has no need to be near the WWE, pathetic tbh.
@NewAgeInsiders They need to be smart in how they build up feuds &amp; make sure they're telling the right story. Bring tension to RAW as well.
@NewAgeInsiders Will do.
#NAI
@NewAgeInsiders Thank you for always putting on a show for us every week. I'm happy to hear that, hope you guys have a ton of fun in Cali.
Great podcast, enjoyed it a lot. @NewAgeInsiders
@NewAgeInsiders Still got 93 minutes left!
@NewAgeInsiders I agree with Jason. No matter who it is, no one can tell a story in 29 seconds.
@LanaWWE Will Rusev ever be pinned? #AskLana

@BestInTheGalaxy didn't work
Anyone got a stream that works?
My stream isn't working, fuck
@LesnarSupport That's true. I mean if all those factors didn't play into it then it would be cool, but that's why it's 99% unlikely.
@LesnarSupport He doesn't have to appear on every RAW &amp; if he played it smart he wouldn't hurt a wrestler.
It would be awesome to see Brock Lesnar work for both UFC &amp; WWE at the same time, but it's most likely NOT going to happen.
Need a stream for ROH.
Big Show isn't that bad of a wrestler, his character/mic skills just makes him boring to watch &amp; listen to.
Imagine if Brock knew he wasn't gonna stay with WWE &amp; he fucked up the main event for WM. That'd bring shock/laughter to my eyes.
WM 28 was a spectacular PPV. In my book, it falls in the top 5 of WrestleManias that ever occurred.
Undertaker vs Sting would've been phenomenal if it happened 5 years ago.
The Miz was the worst WWE Champion of all time.
Paige is smoking hot.

@RondaRousey is the revolution. 

#DownWithTheMachine
@tammys85 I mean WrestleMania is in 4 weeks, so he's gotta turn on him soon.
Orton has to attack Rollins tomorrow night, it made no sense whatsoever for him not to last week because it would've been the perfect time.
@NewAgeInsiders Fingers crossed!
@NewAgeInsiders I don't watch ROH, but I'm going to check it out tonight. Hope to see him in action, he's a terrific wrestler.
Rusev vs Seth Rollins would be outstanding.
Ronda Rousey would utterly destroy every diva on WWEs roster at the same time, she's just that damn good.
Oh dear. 
The Great Khali is opening a wrestling school, LOL.
Everyone go follow @DmS_Thermal, he's new to Twitter give the guy some support!
Having his eye on the IC title. 
The amount of accomplishments Brock has achieved in his fighting career is incredible, don't think anyone will/has achieved more success.
Imagine if Brock Lesnar left the WWE for UFC, my god him &amp; Punk would bring fucking cash to the company. It would bring Vince to tears.
Miss the original masked Kane.
Give me Adrian Neville over Hideo Itami any day.
Emma is so underrated, the way she's used in WWE is just pathetic because she's an amazing in ring talent. Gotta give her a chance, @WWE.
Rusev &gt; Roman Reigns.
I enjoyed Smackdown last night a lot, couple of decent matches &amp; the storyline with the IC title is getting me very excited as well.
@NewAgeInsiders It's good news. WWE can use a guy like him on the mid-card &amp; good way to return is to attack Bryan.(Don't feud with him tho)
#FF @DCMatthews_NAI @NewAgeInsiders @LordRollins @TraskVancity @LiamNAI @xRRNR @RawIsRollins @seethekidwin @Schnazzy @Onedayremains_
It's my #Twitterversary! I have been on Twitter for 2 years (since 27 Feb 2013).
And you? 
Happy about the IC title being defended in a ladder match at WM, no better way to get mid card wrestlers involved in the match as well.
What colors do you think this dress is? Some think gold &amp; white &amp; some think black and blue. Reply with an answer. 
TV-14 &gt; PG.
We have to see Taker on RAW before WM. He can't just show up at WM to fight Bray, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered.

#GiveDivasAChance, Brock Lesnar Rumors, #ROH Anniversary 13, &amp; MORE!

Be Heard
#WWE #NAI #ROH13 

Arrow and #NXT were both so good, loving Wednesdays now.
Love how a lot of superstars are focused on going after the IC title now. The title actually looks important &amp; relevant again.
AJ spoke her mind &amp; that was great, but you can't just say without her the divas division is crap. Other women work their asses off as well.
Can't wait for NXT tonight!
@NewAgeInsiders Roman failing a drug test doesn't shock me, it's Brock leaving the arena that does. To walk out on that situation is odd.
Interesting rumor about Reigns failing his drug test, but I doubt that Brock would get that mad over that.
@WrestleChatNet He needs to appear at least once, we need to know what happened to him last year and why he should fight Bray when he's 21-1
Hope Steph vs AJ happens at WM, always wanted it to happen. Now, it's the perfect way for these two to start feuding after AJs tweet to her.
@NewAgeInsiders It's not a storyline, but I think she's giving her opinion about the topic but she'll probably get punished in some way.
@WWEAJLee @StephMcMahon DAMN
Love the idea that Bryan will be involved in the IC title picture, a 6 man ladder match for the title at WM is the best way to go.
Feel bad for the divas on the main roster, in NXT they get to showcase how good they're in the ring &amp; they do succeed. #GiveDivasAChance
I miss CM Punk so much, wish he would come back to the WWE one day. Was watching MITB 2011 last night &amp; I remember how much I miss him.
@LesnarSupport Happy Birthday
Amazing. 
@NewAgeInsiders I was expecting him to return but he didn't, I think now he won't show up until the go home show for WM.
