Lowkey cool kids

Wait a minute 
Pretty much 
Fate/stay and haikyuu all over my TL rn
@ShojoShit  
Oh my god 
Kujo's hair on point tho (heartthrob) 
@BaeSenpai "in this generation"
Joffrey you's lookin aiight 
Damn Starfire and Flynn got some serious game 
ORIGINAL HUSBANDO  
watch you guys all got trolled and hide isn't actually dead
I HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF YOU ONLY POST THIS FOR ME 
Yagami light is a model everywhere he goes 
Do you think we'd fall in love with the same people all over again if we lose our memories and meet them again?
Hnnggg 

Tbh the only reason I want to watch DRRR!! is because this guy #izaya 
@Zhnc_ I watched an episode and didn't like the animation/artwork so idk I just didn't go back to it
@Zhnc_ yeah i actually I don't watch that one lol
#howtoanitwitter2k15
Y'all are fuckin weebs
I don't even like anime
I heard Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso sucks
I heard Owari no Seraph sucks
I heard One Piece sucks
I heard KanColle sucks
I heard Akame ga Kill sucks
I heard Kill la Kill sucks
Ahhhhh my HEART 
Saki is all that is kawaii
And I like the smart and mysterious bad boys that like to dominate in sex.
Yeah, 
Typical Nee-san. Sigh.
Little odd and and totally inappropriate. Yeah I'm the Nee-san.
I'm not entirely proud of this but I think my personal anime trope is the Nee-san. Im the 20+ redhead who drinks and gets comfy with friends
I married an Inuzuka Kiba IRL so I'm not putting Kiba in that list.
2007 
@AoKiSSING おはよう!
My husbando list could go on but I'll stop there.
1. InuYasha 
2. Uchiha Sasuke
3. Shikamaru
4. Hikigaya Hachiman 
5. Lelouch
6. Edward Elric
7. Shinya Kogami
8. Light
9. Nezumi
10. Haku
@BeastNYC13 number 3 on my husbando list
AMV 
I want Saki's popsicle 
@Main_Shinobi @BasedSupremeKai nigga they got more kids than any other characters. Hinata puts the fuck out
Sry guys my game is on but I can't watch it so I'm relying on twitter and I'm getting hyped lol
I probably just make everything 50x more funny in my mind
I fucking crack up at everything oh my god
@MasterOnii おやすみ~~~
Still craving Takoyaki
Idiot MCs bother the shit out of me. It's probably why I never 100% cared about Naruto as an MC and liked Shikamaru and Sasuke more.
Smart or logical for sure. So much more depth in the show. Steins;Gate, Death Note, code geass, even SNAFU etc  
Don't get me wrong, I loved 花ざかりの君たちへ but the concept itself like how and how could they even get in without valid ID and proof?
The concept of attending an all boys college when you're secretly a girl in manga and manwha just baffles me
"I've been thinking about it for a while now,

But you're a real wimp."
@SawDash they're worth it
Was my joke funny
I have a dying buddy 嬉しい ☆☆ 
I'm saki with names 
【ハハハハ • • •~】
Thus a new fear was born!
@MyrithMalkin there'd be no land forever and I can't swim AND im TERRIFIED of water so deep i cant see the bottom so Id just die right there
I looked down from the plane and saw miles upon miles of nothing but (ocean which I'm terrified of) and thought about if we crashed
Like how shitty lmao
I'm pretty sure the only reason I got my fear of heights was because of my fear of the ocean lmao
@ShohokuTensai10 I never thought I'd be afraid of heights like ever. I thought I was so chill with them and then I flew out of the country.
Saki is so kawaii 
I wonder if I'd like skydiving more than bungee though
I just never considered doing it for fun. thought if I jumped then I'd make a mess for everyone to clean up so the idea went out the window.
@ShohokuTensai10 haha no probs I've always wanted to skydive too... guess I've just really always wanted to jump off of things.
I thought the only time if ever jump off a/t would be when I killed myself but I'm thinking this might be a better approach to my curiosity.
Hubby just asked if anyone would wanna go bungee jumping and I commented by raising my hand slowly
@mamisoawesome おはよー!
Th event match that is going on right now is really fun lol 
Uuuguu~ I don't understand how people can be so confident and secure in their own bodies
I can't tell if that's shoujo manga cute or IRL creepy
She's all lookin out and about for you or maybe she's your roommate and when you don't show up she just lays on your bed and sleeps?
Would guys think it's creepy if your chick friend was asleep in your bed when you came home?
Tsukasa looks so great in a suit.
Miricchi? Miri-chan? Mikki?
I wonder what people would call me as a nickname
好き•••か?
Suki?
Ow my ribs
[SCREAMING] has been the funniest tweet I've read for three days
L

OL
Omg Isla playing with tsukasa's hair while he sleeeeps &gt;
@yellerandpurple golden days
Hmm. I haven't started Gintama for the same reason I haven't continued DRRR!! 
Commitment.
And I'm still drooling over season 2s obvious budget increase
SNAFU really is just one of the best that's come out recently. Everything about it is pretty fucking solid
WHERE ARE HIKKI HANDS



I fucking lost it on this episode when hikki joined in oh MY GOD 
@Si_Senpai anime chick avis everywhere!!! And a one of the people I thought might be a guy had a guy avi and nope I was wrong lol....
@Si_Senpai maybe not several but three lol
@Si_Senpai I've learned just to call everyone bro, dude and bitch and stay away from any other terms until it's obv or announced lol
@Si_Senpai I have been wrong on several occasions this last month and a half about the gender of some of the accounts I interact with
@SportsBishounen be reeled in until almost 50 fucking episodes. I was LOCKED in with Naruto after two.
@SportsBishounen that's why lay I'm trying to do tbh cause I think I'd like bleach if I just -got- there but it pisses me off that I can't
@SportsBishounen that's what I mean dude I have tried SO HARD and I even thought maybe it's just a slow start?  I'm on episode 20 though
Idgi if I can watch Naruto until the very end and there's not really romance in that, why can't I get into Bleach and GL?
I am still trying to get into Bleach like idk man I think I just might have a soft spot for anything that has a HINT OF romance in it
But I'll probably drop it too. Another one I dropped was Gurren Lagaan
Knight of the Area is just absurd in every way shape and form but it's fun to pass time with so even though it's trash, I'm still watching
Ouran High School Host Club or something like that... hated it. Couldn't stand it can't handle it dropped it and I really tried to take it
I've only dropped four animes out of all that I've started.
There are deff animes I don't like out there but I always find something good in them too and I can typically finish them
Like. 
I love a lot of anime ppl like but I also like a lot of some people hate
I really like almost every anime and is because I'm not picky at all

BY€
ALL I WANT IS A SNOW FOX
Wtf happened
Boo
Goodnight /おやすみなさい~/ԅ(¯﹃¯ԅ)
Okay I should probably get a couple hours of sleep in lol
@MasterOnii Yahello!
@ShojoShit @KakoiKristine well done!!
@sweetbeardy 
Idek if you guys are reading that in the tone I am but lol I can't stop laughing when I go over those tweets
I'm still laughing over my typo lol 
You don't want anyone to recognoze you? 
If you are a 
girl: cut your hair and wear male clothes. 
boy: we…
@akakurosexual did you SEE my "marathoning" typo earlier? I'm still laughing about it lol
Add Mirai Nikki to that list too sigh 
And tiny anime hands are cute
Tiny anime hands are tiny
Yamagishi is so cute
@akakurosexual buhuhuh thanks roxy ♡♡
@akakurosexual 4 years ago!!! I wish I still looked like that haha!
Oh I guess I haven't slept yet
My rikku wig needs maintenance done. Someone come comb it and fix up the braids

@rivailleruined おやすみ!
Anyway- I didn't even realize her name was Kaori when I first started referencing Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso lol
Time hopping the shit outta your TL oops sry


4 years ago. Damn let me get back to that plz and thx 
Just having this pinned is getting me a wackadoo amount of notes 
Like there's 2D preferences but I wonder if they stay true for 3D girls as well.
I wonder what differences guys like between 2D and 3D girls. Like long hair vs short. Better on one but not the other? Or same for both?
I'm going back to watching #oneweekfriends lmao fuck my phone
Giggle fit
Fucking marayhoning
I fucking meant marathoning lmao I'm in tears
I fucking lol
I mean really,  marayhoning?
My swype sucks guys at this point I'm just not even gonna correct my typos
I haven't even finished Aldnoah Zero ughhhh I got SO caught up in other anime that I stopped marayhoning and screwed myself over
I need to watch beyond the boundry, kekkai sensen, school idol, NGE, ergo proxy, finish chaika and UtaPri while keeping up with spring animu
@baeflow I need to watch so many shows still. I am catching up very slowly....
I haven't watched beyond the boundary either. Hmm I'm going to have to finish those by the time fall anime starts
Is tokyo ghoul English scanned manga  coming out next month?
What is this beautiful thing called kekkai sensen
<THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN> 
@baeflow again for good.
@baeflow like each episode and it's heavy plot and oh man its just a commitment. I need to focus on it and it only I think when I start it
@baeflow I actually think it'll be a fantastic anime. I've wanted to finish it since season 2 came out but it's just a lot to take in
I'm on episode 3 and I want to continue it but it's such a commitment omg 
This show is SO precious omg
Series Experiments Lain OP and GitS OP are probably my favourites ever. Idk it's so hard to choose but I'm gonna stick to them.
Okay I'm done posting owari no seraph .gifs



Dopescope 
@DIABOLIKNOTE when you get around to it lemme know what you think. I know you don't really end up liking vampire shows
I absolutely love the new animation styles these past couple years ngl. So fluid and beautiful. Even easier to gain the feels imo
@DIABOLIKNOTE but I haven't read it so idk. I love it so far tbh. Blood, angst, great animation and A+ OST
@DIABOLIKNOTE purple haired girl is a classmate who probs falls in love with yuu but I heard in the manga it's a shounen-ai
@DIABOLIKNOTE while the other was turned and that's about as much as I know since I've only seen up to epi 6.
@DIABOLIKNOTE orphan family gets taken in after human race dies off, 4 yrs later family is slaughtered and one boy grows up taking revenge
@DIABOLIKNOTE so good
もうどうでもいい
They are precious together #oneweekfriends
@ShojoShit you're Killin it today A++
@SportsBishounen I did a year and I wanna go back and get my masters (or try to)  in psychology! Forensic Psychology is my goal~
@SportsBishounen yes! We're going to school for at least one same degree then??
@SportsBishounen but I'm not about that social justice twitter life so I'm not gonna go further into it haha
@SportsBishounen yeah and most people accept women having mental illnesses because "ALL women are 'fucking crazy'" anyway (smh)
Yuki and Shogo #friendshipgoals 
@SportsBishounen general so it hurts to see guys seem fine and then all of a sudden, not at all. :/
@SportsBishounen what I'm feeling when I'm off my deep end. even without my disorder, maybe because I'm a girl I'm just more expressive in
@SportsBishounen saw it coming and it was pretty rough... my illness just kind of throws itself out there emotionally and everyone can see
@SportsBishounen yeah a fellow airman friend of my husbands was going through a rough time and ended up taking his own life.. no one really
@SportsBishounen even if I figure they do, they nvr admit it and take pride in themselves regardless. It's sad not to have men to talk to :/
@SportsBishounen (she is a girl though so it is a lot easier). Tbh I don't know many guys who admit or know they have any mental illness.
@SportsBishounen eh well the other person who understood is an ex and she's still 100% in my life but since we broke up it can't be the same
Shirobako is trending but I'm not caught up so I can't click it :|
@SportsBishounen And I am so lucky for that and I don't take it for granted one bit but man I do wish there were more of her out there...
@SportsBishounen always been the one to walk in and take care of me after I'd passed out from loss of blood or overdosing. She's never left.
@SportsBishounen finding understanding legit friends like that is so hard. I have true friends but only one really /understands/ and she's
anyone besides my IRL friends know or remember my first name?
@SportsBishounen now and helps me feel better about scars and panic attacks. i just wish everyone was like that. understanding and open
@SportsBishounen understand it really and he used to always say "just do this" or "you're crazy" and stuff but he's a lot more understanding
@SportsBishounen My mother in law actually is diagnosed with BPD as well so my husband is a really good support for me but he still doesn't
I COULD NEVER BE BLIND OH MY GOD I HOPE I NEVER GO BLIND HOW WOULD YOU GUYS DEAL WITH NEVER SEEING OR READING ANIME OR MANGA EVER AGAIN
but now omg now you guys I'D NEVER BE ABLE TO WATCH ANIME OR READ MANGA EVER AGAIN
I always thought that I would be able to handle being blind. deaf not so much and mute I def could do but I thought I could do blindness too
oh my god
twitter makes me happy and anime makes me happy and my husband makes me happy so as long as I have those I'll be stable right
@SportsBishounen when I have to tell them "what's up" with me. Like I don't want people to know but I also want people to understand.
@SportsBishounen nah it's okay we're being pretty open here haha. It's just kind of a turn-off in friendships and I get hella judgement-
@Renzosama goodnight~
@SportsBishounen Borderline Personality Disorder and Dysthymia and General Anxiety :I You can see why I dont like to bring it on twitter lol
@SportsBishounen once I get back and we'll see how that goes while I'm on meds. I'll never be cured but I can treat it so hopefully!!!!!
@SportsBishounen ee yeah I put myself through hell for years on end til DBT which helped a lot.. I think I'm going to be doing EMDR therapy-
This kid's "defeated" face is A+
@SportsBishounen When I move back home to Oregon I have to get back into therapy and back on meds and away from sharp things. Tough but good
@SportsBishounen yeah I haven't been on meds (lexapro) in a while and it really fucks with me s/t but the worst is not being in therapy
Their reactions and the banter are so funnnnyy
I love these characters lol #oneweekfriends
@SportsBishounen I was diagnosed in 2009 and went in to treatment in 2011 and it has been HELL getting to where I am now, that's for sure!
@SportsBishounen Not doing something about it is lame for sure but man it is not easy trying to treat ourselves when we don't have cures yet
@SportsBishounen yee I was diagnosed nearing the end of HS and I've been in years and years of therapy &amp; patient treatment and meds!!
I def try to keep my mental shit off twitter haha....
@SportsBishounen maaan you'd be surprised what's going on with me outside of twitter haha.. some of us just don't make it a big deal is all!
hey I can be a girl with mental issues and still have good and fun vibes!
@SportsBishounen :(
I'll put my Masters degree in Psychology to good use by making legit online quizzes to find out which anime character you're most like.
Joeseph Joestar (male) has my bday.... lol 

Damm only two chicks! And one is from an eroge game lol
Iris Chateaubriant July 5th 1913
Yuko Sakuramachi 
I wonder what anime girls have my birthday :3
@DIABOLIKNOTE I can't wait for season 2 blaah

@DIABOLIKNOTE It's actually so much easier for me to just go by a nickname tbh "Hikigaya Hachiman" I 1st started calling "Hikki" cause nope

"feelings come and go, but anime is forever"
I just type super fast and then hit tweet. nasty habit that I really need to quit doing.
The only reason why I don't check my typos on twitter obsessively like I do everywhere else is b/c I don't think about what I'm saying
and sometime you can sound sexier but that's always a hit or miss. 
ohhhEYAAH I think I got it
I'm so TIRED OF TYPOS
@SportsBishounen Do you know where a torrent is for the newer release? I'm trying google but I don't really know where to look
Owari no Seraph came out yesterday, didn't it?

@Renzosama @MasterOnii youngin's
Everyone is in the shower so I guess I'll join
Or I guess.. what are you boys calling it these days? "Lit" ? 
Aldnoah Zero's OST is fucking "lit"
So Olympus Knights only does Aldnoah Zero? Hmmmm
@AnimeClips Ghost in the Shell, Steins;Gate, .hack//sign
Aldnoah Zero has one of the best OSTs out there.
When does Nao ever have an emotional face? Smh
I mean I'm pretty sure 3 chirps means dying lifespan but I guess it's possible I'm just ignoring s/t really important &amp; I'm gonna die soon.
Maybe I can duct tape a rag on top my carbon monoxide alarm to muffle it.
Has anyone started "Is it Wrong to Pick up Girls..." at all?
Finally my Internet is back up  animu time
ﾂｲｯﾀ


It's because we like being dominated in the bedroom like they dominate us in shoujo
 (゜-゜) 
Update: Carbon Monoxide alarm is still chirping, my Internet is still down and I STILL don't know where that spider is.
@Trevoreon @Renzosama yeah most have I'm just saying a lot of people /now/ have dropped the anime since the manga ended.
At this point everyone has probably said fuck it and finished the manga series and newest movie lol 
Fo'real though I'd smang every girl in 2NE1
I remember hearing one of 2NE1's songs on a car commercial in America and got really excited that I knew who it was lmao
I guess it has been since like 1999 since I've watched Cowboy Bebop
I love Yoko Kanno like wtf
I didn't realize Ed was based off Yoko Kanno
@kszwartz @ShohokuTensai10 Ed is my girlllll.
Now I gotta change my contact number avi
Holy shit I didn't even recognize you 
@ShohokuTensai10 @kszwartz spiiiikkeeeee
And don't guys care more about proportions rather than one size?
Do girls really have dick size preferences?
@uhhchavez @HARLEMSUNT 
I'd hang out and play Skyrim in my living room but there's no doors TO BLOCK OUT THE CHIRPING FUCK IN MY HALLWAY
@Suddenlink get your shit together
Bby 
The only "memes" I even like anymore since 2007 are animu ones lmao
@BakaBabii epi 4 for me and my Internet is down so I guess I'm watching it off my phone data  haha
FAV  for Hijirikawa's room (left)
#UtaPri

@BeastNYC13 yeah I unhooked it and took out my battery.  Still chirping
But hey at least I can make mini saltine sammiches. 
So my fridge is pretty empty (hot sauces on top shelf) (paper stuck on bottom shelf from idk what) 
I AM GOING TO SCREAM
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GET THIS THING TO STOP CHIRPING
I NEED THIS RIGHT NOW 
@fmp4711 it's SOOOO nice and I LOVE the re design like for their hair and colours and stuff. It looks amazing.

What you see as a cut for attention I see as an erotic mark that is none of your concern. Leave my sex in peace.
It was a release more gratifying than sex in some ways,  rather than a cry for my own sadness.
The cutting was more like sexual gratification, done in privacy while orbs watched crimson blood streak down skin that pulsed like an orgasm

@Andeeisakitteh I need a new corset... maybe we can go shopping soon??
This was not one year ago... haha this was FOUR years ago wtf @Andeeisakitteh 
@CrunchyrolI おやすみ
Oh shit, it's Chris from Skins.
Sasuke was asked if he'd leave to protect Sakura and his daughter.
I wonder if Sarada's medical records aren't stored in order to keep her Uchiha name a secret for protection.
Game of Thrones is like a never ending movie.
Anime is life
Anime is love
@Renzosama @6thGloKage lmao
I did I just didn't tweet it lol
@Renzosama @6thGloKage tbh I'm pretty sure EVERYONE thought this before either of you tweeted anything lmao
I'm NOT READY FOR THIS

*CLICKS NEXT EPISODE*
Oh no I think I just hit the episode where we find out about Dr Derek
Neurology and such is way too heavy of a burden.
Running down the hospital with a severed penis in my hand
@Squad7Reject such a smart anime too. Dialogue and monolog is a+
Probably a relief for the accounts that follow me
My twatter life is quiet when I'm sick or not watching anime.
530am I threw up and didn't get an hour nap in until 3pm or s/t
Dunno why I'm so sickish today.
I was going to do something and now I've forgotten.
Tomato soup sounds good today
My love story aw
Aw love story so cute
I still feel like I'm gong to throw up
I'm unimpressed with you Derek.
It's 11am. Guess I'm back to my rotated sleeping schedule.
But hey I feel a lot better than I did two hours ago. So that's cool.
I haven't slept and I've just been watching greys anatomy in between panic attacks all night/morning lol
Someone burrito me in blankets and put cold cloth on my head 
｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡
(｡ŏ﹏ŏ)
Uguu~
Depression mixed with complete random nausea and idk this sucks I can't move without wanting to throw up
@AoKiSSING おかえり
draco has told me all about you

DRACO HAS TOLD ME…
I feel incredibly nauseous.
Wow my mood has dropped considerably.
cue random nausea
Hm I'm gonna make a new TBL blog and ONLY use if or posting my chapter drafts on. Sounds good.

#Yamato @Squad7Reject 
@poopsona I feel your pain. What kind of art did you used to partake in?
@trashbien this is a great idea. Ty
Cause I /can/ imagine her doing so.
Is it too ooc of Luna to engage in casual sex with another female?
@trashbien Yahello!
Currently writing.
@DystopianKid (laughing hysterically)
@AykiGontier 猫耳さん、ありがとうございます！
@DystopianKid Did you do it? Because I'll double dog dare you if you haven't.

I will give you a SMALL preview of yandere Makoto moment from the upcoming chapter 
Would my great ancestors be happy with me? Visiting the area where they slung, hung and broke the necks of over twenty other accused?
Drinking coffee with glasses on really-
Ho don't say it-
/fogs/ things up.
@Pseudojuuzo lmao alright
@Pseudojuuzo that makes it... what? Impossible to do now?
@Pseudojuuzo Top 5 fave anime? Or ten. I can't choose top five.
@DystopianKid I dare you to recommend him to "ME!ME!ME! Offical Video"
I vote for another season of Generation Kill. Now that Alexander Skarsgard is done with True Blood........................................

@MyrithMalkin I did sticky notes. lmao. I think it's such a beautiful form of poetry though. Just don't make me write in the books.
@MyrithMalkin Told me I could either scan the pages and print them- THEN mark them out and hand it in or I could do sticky notes.
@MyrithMalkin That year in high school was horrible. My college english professor was SO irritated with me and finally leveled with me.
I love books. I don't mark in them. I don't crease pages.
@Treys I feel so privileged :3
@Treys Oh okay. I don't think my mobile shows that and it's the first time in while I've been on my main desktop
@Treys How long has your account been locked?
Ehhhhhh in high school we did that black out poetry or whatever it's called? Where you're supposed to cross out words to form a poem?
@puppetbutter and I LOVE it
Because you weren't in a damn cave at night       Ｂｉｔｃｈ　 
@puppetbutter いいです
#3amThoughts
Why can't losing weight start from EVERYWHERE ELSE besides the bewbs? Don't us women have it hard enough with periods and crazy issues?
@puppetbutter hey I really like these posts.
@Rinnegod Yahello!!!
Gimme 
Writing some of the drunk scenes are really fun. Any of my passages that have angry witty banter make me feel good inside.
I need to find a fandom page or group or s/t for my story. Give access to them in order to get back some feedback and new ideas. Huuuuuhiee.
ayy pretty piece of flesh
@DruggedCreep @Renzosama When it first came out oh man my 9 year-old self thought older Yugi was so fucking hot.
I was 9 when I started watching Yu-Gi-Oh! ? Wow.
Eh, I /am/ a sorted Slytherin though... I guess all my snakes out there are a dying breed.
Draco Malfoy is still my number 1 in all non-anime fictional characters.
@Renzosama You're watching YuGiOh! ?
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh feels like my PC glasses are always smudged no matter what I do
This whole time I've had my notifications set to "People you follow" and wow what a difference it makes when you switch it back.
Fucking metal. 
Myrith needs more Superior Red.
What a broken string of events
Man me without alcohol is weird but I really would like a bottle of wine and scotch in my house at all times
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhaahahahahhhahahawlajfwa;
PORQUEMON
I don't understand creature / bakemono / pokemon porn. Like why
Tori Amos' version of Bonnie and Clyde AND Smells Like Teen Spirit is sooooooooooooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
@puppetbutter I trashed all my old work and kind of went AWOL for a while until this past year. Now I'm trying again and it's a struggle.
@puppetbutter I stopped for a few years because of some mental issues and being in a place where I couldn't type but when I got back to it
@puppetbutter I just never have any motivation and I get stuck so often. I'm so much better at editing other's "work in progress" stories.
@puppetbutter I think I'm alright at it. I took college classes for  2yrs in HS and then furthered myself in my first year of college but
I'm a horrible author. I'm so much better at being an editor why did I choose this lol
I need to go finish writing my chapter as well... I haven't brainstormed in maybe two weeks?
The full size is too large for twatter 
WOW #InuYasha

I feel kinda bad for Jessica Nigiri, missing Summer Sonic coming up. She was JUST in Japan too lol
WOW SOMEONE TAKE ME TO SUMMER SONIC

ダッシュで帰ろう 
Add a comment ... 
Everyones out of school now in Japan. Pretty excited to see more accounts tweeting.
@DeadmanIncX @Renzosama idk I just her being in that movie Precious. I didn't know she was in glee though~
@DeadmanIncX @Renzosama Precious?
@BeastNYC13 It's old styled anime so idk try not to be thrown off by that.
@BeastNYC13 Fo real? Man I'm so not into traps but sometimes I wish I was just so I could watch more hentai categories lol
I've been watching anime since fucking Lupin III and YuYu Hakasho. I'm your Anime Senpai of the group.
@BeastNYC13 RIGHT?
Have my story tickets replenished yet?
I think I've watched my .hack//sign dvds at least 6 or 7 times. Man srsly SAO made me Soooooooooo angry at first when it came out.
If you haven't watched .hack//sign I'm judging you

@BeastNYC13 like idk how SAO pulled off almost completely copying another anime lol.
@BeastNYC13 it's the original VR the game gets hacked and Tsukasa goes into a coma. It's fucking brilliant. 
#asadashino 
Me this is me 
Btw Kirito as a girl &gt;
#sinon 
I'm posting her gungale char so it's sinon
@Renzosama jfc lmao
@BeastNYC13 Ooo i own it ♡♡♡
Kirito and Sinon 

Sao II #asadashino 
SAO II: GUNGALE ONLINE 
@BeastNYC13 it was OK I mean I like .hack//sign so I was bias going into it. SAO II had a great GunGale arc though.
Yuki never leaves my siiiiiiiiiiiiiide 
If I was stoned rn I bet you 200 bucks I could make same good food with what's in my kitchen lol
Being 22 sucks ass lmao
See you fuckers in HS are lucky because your parents and guardians go out and by your fuckin groceries. Fuck you
I'd be a lot happier with SAO if they had more 《main 》male characters
Cypress Hill &gt;
On the plus side I've lost three pounds in three days
If savannah can't go with me grocery shopping this week then I guess I'm ordering another pizza <CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE>
I've been eating 3pc pizza a day with a cup of miso soup and that's it for like a week lol
I have two slices of pizza let and three pax of miso soup left. After that I have some saltines and tom soup. Then I have 
Literally

Tbh I really just wanna go out dancing and drinking at this moment but noooope. Skyrim is probably my next best option lol
Shit I'd even go for a simple glass if wine right now.
I miss having drinks with my hubby.
Aw my little Os at the end <TIRED FACE><FACE THROWING A KISS><REVOLVING HEARTS> 
The animation in 1☮ reallllllllllllly annoyed me when I tried watching the first episode so I just idk I didn't watch it.
I've never seen an 1☮ episode all the way through so I really don't know anything about it
the death in steins;gate was okay because everything is O K. I bet Ergo Proxy is one I can rely on.
AW LITTLE FEET 
Like man everything about that manga / anime royally screwed him over in every way possible
Everytime I think about characters who "didn't do anything - they didn't deserve this!" I go back to Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso &amp; think Kousei.
No one really got FUCKED (minus WR) you know? No MAJOR crazy awful sad deaths and now that's ALL it is.
Wolfs Rain I guess is the exception because DEATH ALWAYS EVERYWHERE EVERYONE NO ESCAPING ALL THE DEATH but....
Old anime wasn't this emotional man. InuYasha had me a couple times and so did Wolfs Rain and stuff but not like THIS bad
I need happy shit. I keep crying over all the anime coming out.
I feel like I should just.... idk status: hiatus from watching any action anime because everyone always ends up dying or in a shitty situat.
@akakurosexual I will if it's canon but rn I still see them as brothers. Once their relationship takes a turn I'll ship/LOVE it I'm sure.
WHEN DOES ANYONE DESERVE ANYTHING IN MANGA
@akakurosexual but rn I love Mika and I love Yuu and I REALLY don't want to pick sides. smh
@akakurosexual Nah I'm not impatient with anime at all. I'm down to wait for the epis. Just ugh. I def. don't ship Yuu/Mika
Sasuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuukeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
@akakurosexual And I LOVE MIKA right now but man smh I know some shits gonna go down and I'll be all Yuu.
@akakurosexual I haven't read the manga but I'm keeping up with the anime and so far I think I know where this story is going ....
#NarutoGaiden my kokoro still pitter patters when I see Sasuke~~

20 PAGES IS NOT ENOUGH KISHIMOTO
@Renzosama finally omg
My Sim is making mixed drinks at 530am. Sounds about right.
I'm God over my own personal Sim life. I really wish I could have added my little dog. Then it'd be perf. 
I'm at it again 
@pimpslashrapper I'm pretty sure I always want burgers :|

TBH Espeon was my first eeveelution and it was an accident but she's my favourite one besides Flareon anyway.
@puppetbutter Don't turn her! Get others and turn them!

They don't have enough spots in my belt for all the Eeveelutions so imo they fucked up. I hate choosing which ones to keep in my belt.
I have all the Eeveelutions and Idk what to do with my life anymore 
Yes I live in MY Winstad Manor and NO you CAN'T USE MY FISH HATCHERY GO awAY

That mix really does make me cry no joke. Tearing up every time I hear it.
Loving this 
Estel and Alfred are next.... then maybe I'll get back to Greys.
@Si_Senpai is one thing but illegally drinking is another and that never stopped me haha. It was a lot cheaper drinking then too. Lower tol.
@Si_Senpai I had roommates and was working part time after my first year of college so it wasn't all that uncommon! And legally drinking
Some of the most fun years of my life was 18-20....... I graduated HS at age 17 and moved out by 18. 
King Jean looks so much more attractive without his crown on.
@MyrithMalkin 

Fucking cold
@Pseudojuuzo that's what I do! And my tumblr transcends into twitter a lot. Fuck the SJW shit. So it's stupid to say "fuck tumbl" like lol
Problem is SJWS exist ALLLLLLL over twitter too and the only reason you don't deal with it is because we don't follow them (cough)
@Pseudojuuzo oh trust me, I know and I completely understand. I'm just 100% certain people would use it if they followed anime shit lol
It's not my fault you fuckers can't find the right blogs to follow.
Even some quotes. and YOU ALL LOVE IT LOL
It's funny most everyone on my TL hates tumblr but lol jokes on you, 90% of the photos and .gifs I post on here are from there.
HAPPY CONDOM DAY
@CrunchyrolI well at least you're feeling a lot better. That cough will get better eventually <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>

I made myself the biggest fucking bowl of miso soup today omg.
I need to finish greys  before I can marathon GoT
Tossing and turning and trying to sleep for an hour and a half is snot what I meant but at least I got another two hours
Back to sleep and ugh praise animu god that I get back my erotic dreamlands
My hormones have been stupid crzy this last month &amp; a half. I know the hubby's been gone for 6mos but how tf can a body CRAVE sex like this.
Fell asleep at 645am and woke up at 10am and I'm pretty sure I woke up from some kind of erotic dream (bummer)
@bleach1046 "fuck this MV" hahahaha
Everything about me!me!me! Is brilliant and anything opposing that, I will hear none of it! *lalalalalalalalalalaLALALALALALALALALALALALA!*

I love robots and THEY CAN LEARN FEELINGSXBJS
Like I'm that girl that has sympathy for AIs.
Fuck em both fuck em all. Whatever lol
Er "cruelty" loosely used. Not cruel necessarily just some shit bugs me. And yet I probably like animals more than most humans
I'm so split about Animals. On one hand I really don't fucking care about most of em and on the other I get irritated with cruelty toward em
@lord_jagganath yeah you COULD but I don't LIKE that people would lmao
@lord_jagganath yeah don't care for much of those either. Assisting dogs are aiight. They get to walk around a lot and no one RIDES them lol
I could probably even say I hate horses but idk man still don't like them used for shit.
What all consists of "working" animals?  I'm a city girl idk shit about animals
@lord_jagganath nope. What even are those lmao. I don't even LIKE horses. In fact I dislike them.
@lord_jagganath I just don't like the idea of horseback riding.
@lord_jagganath and I don't care about any of that lol I just simply don't like the idea of horseback riding
Just don't like the idea of horseback riding.
I'm not an activist for animals or whatever the fuck they call themselves.
@lord_jagganath not against eating animals or testing on mice and such. Don't like animal cruelty but idk something about horseback riding
Idk I'm not even some kind of vegetarian or whatever but something about horseback riding really annoys me
They are animalllllllsss. Not automobiles
Idk why but the idea of riding horses backs reallllly bothers me.
The king calls it "counting coppers"!!!! LIKE COUNTING PENNIES! (Inside joke)
Jauffery? Jaffery ? Htf do you spell his name?
JAFFREY
The op to GoT makes me want to make a miniature version of that entire land. With little tiny trees.
AkaKuro is actually RedBlack and I find that interesting as a ship name. <THUMBS UP SIGN><OK HAND SIGN>
If I need to see more of the screen all I have to do is move it.
I see the appeal of a tiny floating keyboard... 
Haru/makoto and nagisa <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

like if i watch an actual basketball game id be really confused
Things and stuff....
Hmmmm
@MyrithMalkin sweet guy trying to test him into accepting it and it can be SO LOVING like total opposite of most hentai it seems like
Guys in yaoi are so idk like one is always the "no, I'm not like tha- ah~~ &lt;blushing from emb. and feel goods&gt; and the other is the
DYING
"THE ONE WHO TRIES TO STOP YOU IS AN OTAKU"
LOL
1.) say "anime is for kids lol"
2.) the one who kills you is an otaku
1.) mention the name "Kaori Miyazono"
2.) the one who cries is an otaku
1.) ponytail your hair to the side
2.) the one who stops you is an otaku
1.) say "Let's go home. "
2.) the one who cries is an otaku
Yaoi is so fucking different than yuri and hetero. Like guys are so different together sexually than female by 100%
Wait if I put the letters in WITH THE PHOTO they take precautions?  WHY haven't I been doing this all along?!

@DystopianKid it really does idk why I didn't think about that. I say everything else with ani in the front!!
1) Walk into a Free! fandom

3) ...now watch a RinHaru shipper pounce at you.

Someone just favourited my tweet about the garbage disposal so I read it Ion screen, giggle, then felt lame for laughing at my own post lol.
So my laptop has apps on its dashboard (i have a google laptop or something) with twitter is connected so everytime I'm notified it pops up
@uhhchavez  no there's two so far. The blonde who was undressed and eyesexed and then the siblings who pushed the boy off the ledge

@MyrithMalkin the window with a glass of cheap wine and a notebook to write my novel in, listening to chill ass beat music. Alone.
Ever since middle school I've wanted to own a shitty apartment on a high floor with crappy vertical wooden walls where I can sit next to
@BeastNYC13 @ThatGuyBT4 You're posting anime music I like with mixes I'm bound to enjoy. Keep going
I am not a Futa fan but it seems like that's the biggest anifetish ever so I'm kinda bummed about that
@uhhchavez oh okay even easier!!!
@ShohokuTensai10 menma was at peace and was so happy and optimistic about her situation ugh I'M GONNA CRY AGAIN
@uhhchavez damn right I can. 5 seasons 1hr per episode? Psh done in a month. (I didn't actually calculate that so probably longer lol)
Why didn't I watch this sooner 
#beybladeofthrones
Is game of thrones about dragoons
Well hey it isn't that farfetched is it? Anime is gettin hyped 
Dead lolis are the best lolis.

KinA makes me think that when I look at the screen, some school doctor is gonna start ripping off the girls shirt 
@Trevoreon Asuna scene kills me but Shika is my bby and seeing him and his life after that is just ugh the feels.
@MyrithMalkin LOL OH MY GOD I ALMOST POSTED THAT ON FACEBOOK
Okay so I know Knight in the Area is a shit anime but can I just say that the animation is on par with Hentai animation?

@ShohokuTensai10 Oh are they not? That's disappointing....
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
@ShohokuTensai10 Oh yeah I know that I'm just saying "NGE" because it's the easiest to type for shorthand.
@ShohokuTensai10 I'm saying the Anime name for short Neon Genesis Evangelion
anime accounts &gt;
Maybe I should watch Ergo Proxy starting today. Either that or continue trying to figure out where remastered NGE is
Emily Browning 
saoirse ronan 
@ShohokuTensai10 I didn't see it right away because I was on my notifications tab the entire time I was on a diff website lol
I don't see how I could look like Saoirse Ronan and Emily Browning simply because of my nose. Idk I feel like the nose is a big deal
I've been told Saoirse Ronan and Emily Browning the most over the past five years. 
@ShohokuTensai10 Well I'm just going off the photo and who I know celeb wise. I dont think I look like anyone but I get told otherwise a lot
@ShohokuTensai10 I know he's not native but the closest I can think that you remind me of C.S Lee.
@ShohokuTensai10 OKAY!  :D
@GrumpyGleam Someone on FB said the eyes which the only reason the girls in the photos look like that is b/c of fake lashes and eyeliner!?
omg haha thank you! I don't really like my face especially my nose. The results are really weird to be b/c 
#iwatobisc 
#teamrocket 
@Si_Senpai I want the Witcher so badlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
@MyrithMalkin I used THREE PHOTOS 
LIKE HOW WHAT WHERE DO I LOOK JAPANESE AT ALL 
lol idgi what part about me looks japanese at ALL
celeb generators always think I look japanese which is HILARIOUS
@ShohokuTensai10 haha well damn that's no fun!!!
@ShohokuTensai10 well public figures count too!
OH WHAT A FUN GAME. Everyone should generate their celeb look alikes and instead of posting YOUR photo, just post the celebrity
I wonder who everyone's celeb look-a-likes are.
@GrumpyGleam I figured if I saw "it's an FF day" then it rolls off the tongue and sounds correct but I can't figure out if that's legit lol
Are there exceptions to the "an + VOWEL" rules? I fucking hate english.
@MyrithMalkin sentence like "it is a FF day." Granted, "it is a fan fiction day" sounds right but not "FF" so idk I'm confused
So I know you're supposed to use "an" when dealing with VOWELS like "an identity" or "an event" etc But it sounds wrong to not use "an" in a
I MEANT VOWELS
@GrumpyGleam Oops i don't mean nouns I mean uhhh the AEIOU fuck what is that called? VOWELS
@beccachu92 
@DIABOLIKNOTE 
@beccachu92 I see my momma's work place!!
AND IT'S SO SHOUJO-ESQUE WHEN THEY DISCOVER THEMSELVES. It's presh 
After my big yaoi speech last night I get online today and every one is talking bout yoai. I feel like a gay goddess. 
Wow haven't been on twatter like at all today
Okay  you can do this... just put.... down.......... the phone.....
@lord_jagganath I know.... I will when I get back on meds!!! Hopefully.
Btw someone bring me tacos or nachos please and thank you
I should try to get my three hours of sleep in rn. It's 430
Probably why all the boys in #iwatobi are so cute imo
@lord_jagganath this might be my transition media.
I like skinny athletic anime boys with no shirt on, unzipped pants and a fucking cute smile with perf hair. Hngggg
@lord_jagganath is it a shounen-ai?
@ShojoShit bbys smile
@lord_jagganath it's on my to watch list! Never have seen it before.
LIKE HOW CUTE OMG <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><KISSING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Sry I just wrote a twitter light novel lmao
Mix that with my blazing hormones and not having sex since early December and idk give me a slash or mash (hetero) fanfic and call it good
Maybe the Shounen shows w/o girls are just easier to pick out the cute boy relationships they have together. I love love so.
Never really occurred to me to ship a straight guy w/ another str8 guy. Hell, I'm as gay as I am str8 so it's not like I'm against it at all
Like girly love is different sometimes because you see it all the time w/straight on straight girls but you never see that with guys so it's
@ShojoShit I love it though <BLUE HEART><GREEN HEART><YELLOW HEART><PURPLE HEART>
@MyrithMalkin other straight characters. Now I'm idk I'M CONFUSED AND I THINK THE BOYS ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER WHAT DID YOU GIRLS DO TO ME
I mean I'd ship gay characters make and female if that's how they felt toward each other but I never would have shipped straight chars with
@lord_jagganath it isn't anything more than a normal shounen. Like idk what happened to me lol
@lord_jagganath I feel like I got sucked into it by wanting to watch the shows and loving how cute they were with each other even when it
@lord_jagganath I liked Shounen-Ai's when I saw no.6 but idk ever since Iwatobi sc Fanservice and KnB Fanservices blew up my social media
I never wanted to be into yaoi but maybe I never had the choice <WAVY DASH><ROSE>

My mother sent me a package and when I opened it I was really confused to see this 
Genders reversed this is how I feel about the fem-protags I have to play ugh  
I've never cared for yaoi but when you throw together an all boys team and make them cute together IDK I'M CONFUSED NOW
And now that there's all these boys sports animes out idk  it's hard not to jump on the yaoi bandwagon. Or at least the Shounen-Ai one.
I didn't really care for Shounen-Ai until u saw No.6 and I fell SO HARD FOR THEM TOGETHER. But then idk like No.6 was the only one I saw

@ShawnGiggles I'm almost 23 and love 16yr old anime boys so idk at least she's real and legal.
I am so excited for Digimon Adventure Tri!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Guess it's time to watch stuff on CR. I feel like the only thing I can think of to watch rn online is NGE or ErgoProxy but not in the mood

I'M READY FOR YOU STEINS;GATE ZERO
@velhunt yeah I watched a few episodes when it first came out but then life hit me. Just got back to it this past month! S;G 0 is coming out
I'm cringing at my grammar I just don't know how else to put that lol
I really only consider spoilers to be *spoilers* if it's been no longer than a month (or two) since the episode has aired.
@ShohokuTensai10 @velhunt I WAS SPOILED BEFORE THAT EPISODE. Technically this show has been out long enough there IS NO real spoilers lol
IT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN STOP SAYING "IF WE SCREW IT UP"
YOU CAN'T SCREW UP TIME TRAVEL
@ShohokuTensai10 yeah that was a really cool way to explain their "altering" theory
and I couldn't fathom how it was confusing. Future is future. It's such a simple concept
I remember everyone being confused reading Hermione and harry's time travel adventures in Harry Potter book 3
@ShohokuTensai10 hell fucking no. It's always made sense since I learned what "time travel" meant!
I'm so glad I understand time travel.
@GrumpyGleam But now I don't feel left out!!!!!
Hey it looks like we all changed out AVIs over the past day and a half!

Smdh of /course/ I woke up after three hours god fucking dammit PEACE OUT
My eyes hurt still so maybe I can jump back in it if I'm able to fall back asleep
It was GLORIOUS
Because apparently we were the only two without sexual connections to each other and I ran over a few booths, high fiving him w/both hands
From across the seating arrangement we were in (his booth was a couple down) when I abruptly stood up and yelled "hey we haven't!"
Everyone was talking about how they realize they have all slept together in some way or sex family and me and my friend looked at each other
can I PLEASE GO BACK TO BED AND DREAM MY DRAMATIC DREAM SERIES NOW
@PizzaGuy_Hide means goodnight!
Of course I've only been asleep for three hours AUGH
But it's so good and I wish I could explain it
Having breakfast food, drinks and go over the  stuff that's happened and ohmy god I know this sounds so weird and confusing
I have this reoccurring storyline when I sleep sometimes and by the end of the dream we all end up in this lowkey dive bar
Those dreams you have that are like episodes in a show &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Got on my phone to read smut and somehow ended up on twatter again

2012 - 2014 were slooooowwwwwwwwww twitter years for me. I easily had triple what I have now in the span of three years back in 2011.
Sometimes I wish I still had my old twatter account. I'd probably be up to 100k tweets by now sigh
I wish I had an actual number. All I can read is 17.8k
Jennifer Love - Hewitt is def a better character in this show. She was terrible in ghost whisperer blah.

I was on good terms w/the kid that probs would have shot up my school. He stabbed my friend in the neck with a goddamn pencil one time

Daredevil is such a better show than the movie by like 500 percent. WHEN IS SEASON TWO COMING OUT
I'm ordering food in again. Craving asian but they don't deliver on military base so I'm fucked there.
For someone who is going into law, I probably shouldn't say this but I love vigilantes. If I was bad-ass enough to do it I totally would.
My house is so horribly lacking food to the point that the thought of making a grocery list is stressing me out lol
tbh I sometimes don't talk to my friends for months at a time but when we do talk it's like nothing has changed lol
the bad guys never stay in the police cars and in custody I mean come on
that sounds s o  g o o d
