@demijolras <PERSEVERING FACE> OMG so not cool!
@TMIToronto @edsheeran said the tickets were a Valentine's gift, just didn't say that it was a really advance gift! Will tell all about it.
@TMIToronto @edsheeran concert hasn't happened yet - it's in June!
@StuartCamp accidentally brilliant timing releasing Photograph in time for North American Mother's Day. As a fan and a mom, it was lovely!
@TMIToronto @edsheeran I love all the songs and even in 200 level seats so psyched to see Ed! Tix were my Valentine's Gift to my daughter.
@TMIToronto @jonclayharris we'll only get one Magnus, but hopefully the rest of these actors can get onto shows soon!
@TMIToronto @edsheeran it's my favourite song and how perfect this video cropping up just for Mother's Day!
Tonight, I had to go out and behave like a mature adult. I can pull off this guise, mostly by nodding and smiling while clueless.
@Kat_McNamara we are so excited for you to play Clary! #Shadowhunters
@edsheeran you've been the cutest thing ever from birth to now. PS don't tell my daughter I said that.
@TMIToronto @jonclayharris however, while we wait we've raised awareness of attractive Asian actors, which good for our diversity knowledge!
Ed Sheeran - Photograph (Official Music Video)

Apparently early bedtime is replaced by shrieking drunken idiots yabbering at the bus stop having left the bar. Boo!
Looks like the American #WolfPack is loving #BittenS2 as much as the Canadian did! #RenewBitten #WolfPackPride @bittentv @eOne_TV
All the Canadian trends are about sports which I couldn't care less about. Early bedtime!
@TMIToronto @TMI_PH @IdrisBR I think it's easier to hide on facebook and easier to get called out on Twitter.
Dear #Shadowhunters cast, please avoid posting anything involving ducks and mangos unless you want mayhem. @cassieclare can fill you in. <WINKING FACE>
@Mynameis_Beckyy he's perfect to be stern yet caring pack leader @ShadowhuntersTV @isaiahmustafa
@ShadowhuntersTV @isaiahmustafa swoons!
Trying to not put the cart ahead of the horse now I've fancast Magnus... Lol
@cassieclare @Who_is_Kimy @citedestenebres yes please! Let me live vicariously through you meeting other fans!
So @secretaustinman is Asian, gorgeous and 6' tall... #MagnusPlease @McGsWonderland @jonclayharris @ShadowhuntersTV
@heyclace @TMIToronto @jonclayharris @secretaustinman OMG yes!!! I can see this <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@blakcirclegirl and proud of it!
@magnusftalec you know, @cassieclare seems to have the patience of a Saint on all this stuff!
@AgentM @AgentsofSHIELD @AgentCarterTV @TheMuppetsABC crossing my fingers for that Agent of Muppets cross-over
@cassieclare @Who_is_Kimy @sarahreesbrenna Kim needs rewards for her amazing edits *drops hint with anvil*
Gave the dog back his most obnoxiously loud squeaky ball. For some reason the people who live in this house keep hiding it. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@TMIScotland night night!
@yasizacrob stomps foot impatiently bc it was mailed before Valentine's Day!
So, Jace's hair colour didn't matter - but Clary's did
Jace's eye colour didn't matter - but Alec's does
Spoiler: Magnus won't have cat eyes
@__Andi__ so happy for you! (And also a bit jealous)
@__Andi__ <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
@blakcirclegirl there is no chance I'll ever plan a roommate situation again with your crazy roommate stories!
@yasizacrob is the box there yet???
... So we've all seen what Luke, Simon and Jace look like topless. *fans self* anyone found shirtless Alec yet? Pressure is on for Magnus!
@isaiahmustafa you get to play the caring man every teenage girl wishes she had in her life - no pressure! #ShadowhuntersTV
@blakcirclegirl pictures fake stripper cop after having just seen shirtless Luke actor <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@ClubFandemonium many shirtless Luke scenes must be written in!
@cassieclare was Luke one of the top 2 you mentioned yesterday?

@yelyahwilliams 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
@cassieclare was that one of your top two for Luke?
@mortalmonteith @levisparabatai our Jace doesn't have gold eyes cuz those don't exist so can we trust they sort it all out?
@northernfancon @isaiahmustafa are you ready for the fact this guy has now had a major casting announcement today?! Jealous of Prince George
@mortalinstitute Luke as very athletic is perfect for a werewolf!
@ClubFandemonium i compulsively checked the first three books years ago and we never got a hair colour even for Luke there so loving it!
@FizzleCollins that's the most Alec pic of Matthew I've seen - feeling better!
Our Alec can definitely pass as our Izzy's brother but otherwise I'm on the fence - hope they give a clip later of him moving &amp; speaking
Luke being a POC will make Maia thinking he's the perfect pack leader line up so well!
I noticed @cassieclare never so much of a hair colour for Luke, so totally down with that casting! #WhoIsLuke #Shadowhunters
@StuartCamp <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> so what's your fave movie?
@X929 @MattX929 @XFestCalgary thanks that's what I figured but didn't want to be the dummy on the wrong number. We want so much but no $!
@X929 @MattX929 is it the request line you call? Heard the cue, called and busy over n over!
@mortalinstitute 3
@NBCUndateable never watched (or even heard of) the show before @edsheeran was on it. Now I have to watch all the episodes. #Success
@jonclayharris @cassieclare I think the whole fandom has give a huge sigh of relief and then cheered. Complexities of Magnus add to story!
@FunkoPopShop #AvengersAgeOfUltron has Hawkeye and Vision but no Black Widow. WTF @Marvel?
@TheMarySue
@midnightrose434 fingers crossed! I think by going big action the movie tried to - was about half men the times I saw at the cinema
Day 2 of new med: feeling jittery. Can see why the pamphlet said week 1 I could be "more volatile" yucky.
@midnightrose434 the new UK covers are super feminine, but I'm hoping the new American ones will get more boys to crack it open!
@whedonesque the last thing Joss wants is a book of world rules/"series bible" as thick and regulated as Star Wars IMO
@JurassicPark not compatible with iPad 2 - really? <UNAMUSED FACE>

@Zendaya 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 

@LilyAldridge 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
@cassieclare the stories or the covers? I think the stories are great for both!
@cassieclare do you know if thought was  of 'girl covers' vs 'boy covers'? The new US CoB looks much more gender neutral than original IMO.
@SageHillfarms only, I'm neither young nor wise so I'm ummmm mature? No, doesn't work... Working on my second wind?
@SageHillfarms ladies never look old - they just look young or wise <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
So Wal-Mart, Sears and Canadian Tire are taking over the stores left when Target Canada shut down. Fair trade.
@CharliScott both. Drown your sorrows?
@maureenjohnson my newspaper says in Britain they get to bring dogs into the polling stations when voting. This was missing from your info!
I don't pick favourites among my friends <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Happy #FF! The way I do this is if you follow me and I'm not following back, tell me what we have in common for a follow.
@EnverGjokaj are the sweater vest colours picked out yet? <PARTY POPPER>
After previous &amp; today's show renewals, there's only one show in my heart left pending. @bittentv #RenewBitten! #WolfPackPride
@whedonesque if we didn't love to feel pain why would we follow a Whedon themed account?
@AgentCarterTV and @AgentsofSHIELD renewed the same day as @OrphanBlack makes me feel strong female roles on TV win today.
@Mynameis_Beckyy sorry to hear it. Ours (provincial) Tuesday went way left wing so I'm all yay health care yay education... shit taxes
@Belen_Ariana seems like a good idea. My sister is a high ranked HR manager for an international bank so she's been taking her Spanish!
@Mynameis_Beckyy how's things going with your election results?
@cassieclare @HebelDesign so if we are going "OMG how will I pass the time til Lady Midnight" mayhaps spend some of it learning Spanish?
@OrphanBlack season 4 is a go already? Much good news today and I've scarce left my bedroom!
So @taylornation13's staff are removing any full song tour videos from youtube. Umm of course - it's copyright &amp; was forbidden to record it.
@all_things_hp I admit my ignorance of UK politics but I'm guessing similar issues of taxes, health care, education, minimum wage apply
@YugenBliss walking outside or window shopping at a mall aka bookstore (both mostly free bc idk your budget)
@all_things_hp having 87 seats and a party to go 4 to 53 is very strange. Hopefully the UK votes for what's best whatever that is.
@FizzleCollins can't deal with that again. But both referenced Always &amp;Forever same day
@TMIexaminer @ShadowhuntersTV Malec!
@DutchNephilim #WhoIsHodge

Dying of laughter over the #NewAlbertastan tweets. Please keep it up #MockTheRight
I rarely post me because self-esteem but a wet puppy makes a great fashion accessory 
Dear UK friends, please vote today. My riding sits at an exact tie (pending recount) after Tuesday's Alberta election. Your vote counts!
@TMIWiki @DutchNephilim some day soon we will all be offline and they will announce the rest lol
@X929 @GrahamMosimann Nope. never seen any of the Americans who said they'd move to Canada if Obama got re-elected either. Talk is cheap.
@all_things_hp that was what we expected - a minority hodgepodge that couldn't do anything, but here's BBC on it 
@all_things_hp I agree: no vote, no complaint. The issue was we'd had the same people for 20 years, low votes meant a huge change.
@all_things_hp it is so important. Where I live had our provincial election. Many are unhappy with the results but less than 60% voted.
I loved the #TMIMovie cast, but there's room in my heart for a clean slate and the #ShadowhuntersTV cast.
#LilyCollins deserves better fans than the ones tweeting hate on Kat. Seriously. You can prefer Lily without insulting Kat.
@birdkittyme also, we don't want Cassie to be ashamed of us.
To everyone directly tweeting hate to our #ShadowhuntersTV cast. #Lilyians doing this know Lily would be disappointed. Als
@edsheeran crying watching it! Epic kickoff to your tour leg and shows what your music means to your fans <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@IMBrettDalton daily tweet? Always birthdays and probably someon with an exam...
@davecournoyer are other recounts pending besides the 2 mentioned? I need more math! #abvote
@McGsWonderland <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ #SupportMcG
@TMIToronto @cassieclare @McGsWonderland there will be always changes in an adaptation but they have explanations! Open communication!
I love most of my #Shadowhunter fandom but some people's behaviour to McG has me angry and embarrassed.
@TMI_Source someday soon can you big fan accounts set up to trend our appreciation for McG's tweeting updates to us?
@McGsWonderland please, don't let the negativity send you away. We are so happy and fortunate to have updates. Left in the dark before you.
@dessywinsy true that. Glad Joss Whedon clarified his reasons for leaving.
@McGsWonderland it's going on the record that you've promised perfection! @cassieclare @ShadowhuntersTV @TMI_Source
@dessywinsy all of the tweeting by the individuals involved other than thanking fans for support is unprofessional IMO
@dessywinsy some he just wounds in ghastly ways. I'm not a fan of that.
@dessywinsy is there team everyone STFU or do I get to captain that one?
@dessywinsy there were teams? I go to a meeting about laundry rooms and now there's teams?
Apparently it takes 2 pamphlets and a piece of paper plus the in person step by step demo to use the fancy washers... 
@cassieclare clean slates for us!
Jace is 5'11" Izzy is 5.9" Clary is 5'4" if this is critical to anyone #WhoIsClary #Shadowhunters
@cassieclare personally I want to see whomever has chemistry for a sibling relationship with our Izzy and a Parabatai one for Jace for Alec
@cassieclare @mariapaulaomena @Kat_McNamara and Dominic's IMDb says 5'11" in case anyone wants that differential lol
@TMIScotland just like they jumped on Emeraude much more than Alberto <POUTING FACE>
@TMIScotland I cannot believe people jumped to criticize hair immediately. Did they with Dominic?
@DomSherwood1 @cassieclare Jace does sneer at Downworlders initially
This is a perfect photo to show @Kat_McNamara as Clary 
@anerdgirlsays she's in The Scorch Trials so she may carry fans with her!
@Kat_McNamara were you surprised at the guesses days ago? I know I saw nothing but excitement when you were guessed! Congrats!
@A_SunnySpot it's the best polite way to show your disapproval #CanadianTweet
Holy crap! Our ninja Shadowhunters were right! Mad skills!
@nephilimevents @FizzleCollins @ShadowhuntersTV yes!
@dessywinsy trivial drama. The UK at least also has an election blocking them from trending.
Ok now he's awake and waiting for #WhoIsClary 
“@Who_is_Kimy: @DutchNephilim So ready” yes! I can't wait! #WhoIsClary
@TMIScotland sweatpants check, diet coke, check, slouching on couch, check #WhoIsClary
@TMI_Source #WhoIsClary and #WhereIsCassie
@madmanin221b @ShadowhuntersTV first #WhoIsClary then #WhoIsMalec
I'm all #WhoIsClary and he's all @ShadowhuntersTV 
We need to know who plays the girl who lost her virginity in hell but in a good way is! #WhoIsClary
We've lost steam - back down to tenth in Canada #WhoIsClary
The little girl who was allowed to walk to school alone so long as she was with Simon #WhoIsClary
@dessywinsy and American Football deflated ball investigation report drama <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Coffee, black like my soul #WhoIsClary
Where is @cassieclare when we're in this frenzy? #WhoIsClary 
Excited, I hope!
The girl who couldn't figure out her best friend was in love with her #WhoIsClary
The girl who wanted to dump the pot of soup on Isabelle's head #WhoIsClary
Waits for followers to drop like flies as I vomit #WhoIsClary all over my TL
30 minutes! Time to pee so you don't when we find out #WhoIsClary <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
#WhoIsClary may define the attention the media will give this show. No pressure!
I'm running out of things to say about Clary and I don't have my books!
Who will be wearing Isabelle's shirt as a dress? #WhoIsClary
@TMI_TID_UK oh right. Good thing my election was yesterday! #WhoIsClary 
The election is an important one tbh.
With the right cast and our fandom strength we can get @ShadowhuntersTV from CoB through CoHF #WhoIsClary
During our excitement to trend #WhoIsClary @maureenjohnson will kidnap Simon with a watermelon.
@TMIScotland I think 1D is why UK isn't trending and NFL Patriots DeflateGate in the US #WhoIsClary
We are #Shadowhunters we will never give up! #WhoIsClary @ShadowhuntersTV
@TMIScotland @TMI_TID_UK hoping to trend #WhoIsClary over there so you for sure get the show!
@ShadowhuntersTV we need the US and UK too! #WhoIsClary
The top 2 trends are about very negative things so it's more important than ever to trend #WhoIsClary
@ShadowhuntersTV now we for sure need a network in Canada to carry the show since we are so passionate! #WhoIsClary
@ClubFandemonium last I looked we're fourth trend in Canada with #WhoIsClary
Trending my fingers off for @ShadowhuntersTV #WhoIsClary
4th in Canada not counting promoted #WhoIsClary @ShadowhuntersTV 
I will know #WhoIsClary before mini me gets home from school <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@jonclayharris we are not a patient fandom! #WhoIsClary but we are still trending in Canada! <PARTY POPPER>
Sorry for using 1D and deflated balls in the same tweet - to clarify they're unrelated <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #WhoIsClary
US you'd better start trending, we need you! #WhoIsClary
Forget 1D and deflated balls people, what matters is #WhoIsClary @ShadowhuntersTV
In the end, it's not hair colour, eye colour or height that forms the essence of #WhoIsClary when it comes to the right actress.
#WhoIsClary cuz Clace
@Sarah_Hyland we're so excited that you're excited! #WhoIsClary
This role will set everything up for @ShadowhuntersTV #WhoIsClary
@mackenlh @TMI_TID_UK yeah they take up 3 of the top 10 in Canada RN but #WhoIsClary hit #10 here!
@ShadowhuntersTV #WhoIsClary is trending 10th in Canada!
@ClubFandemonium @TMIToronto
Maybe Dominic will video announce #WhoIsClary @ShadowhuntersTV?
@tessagraying don't be sorry, you got all our feels going
@Marvel this really sucks fit loyal Canadian #AgentsofSHIELD fans. 
@tessagraying what are you trying to do to us?
@ShadowhuntersTV we are so excited @Sarah_Hyland wants to know #WhoIsClary with us!
1H15M @ShadowhuntersTV #WhoIsClary
I hope @cassieclare is grinning diabolically waiting for our explosion of excitement @ShadowhuntersTV #WhoIsClary
“@Sarah_Hyland: My entire Twitter feed is filled with #WhoIsClary tweets, @ShadowhuntersTV.  So tell me! #WhoIsClary <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>” yes! Help us trend<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@FizzleCollins the secret to @ShadowhuntersTV announcing it was you logging off. They have spies! #WhoIsClary <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Please don't hit on our Simon who's already tweeted he has a girlfriend after being objectified once cast, k thanks. #WhoIsClary
Clary is the only girl ever a romantic match for Jace because she doesn't just swoon at the sight of him @ShadowhuntersTV #WhoIsClary
It's not about the perfect shade of hair and eyes, all about the scrappy little lass who will do anything for those she loves #WhoIsClary
He got ahold of one of my baked Tostitos Scoops now he's whimpering and giving this look...
PS #WhoIsClary 
The girl who outstubborns the most stubborn #WhoIsClary
Our artist turned fighter... #WhoIsClary
@Belen_Ariana how can we not give the show a little faith with this Simon? @ShadowhuntersTV @arosende
@TostitosCanada are baked scoops safe for dogs? Asking for someone who got ahold of one and now wants the bag...
Plot twist: Church will also be playing Clary as his cat actor required more screen time #WhoIsClary
@McGsWonderland yay! @cassieclare should always know ahead of us, please? This was a failure in my view with movie stuff @ShadowhuntersTV
Maybe we got our Alberto video bc they felt bad for a false start on #WhoIsClary
@clarysparabatai he is so adorbs it's a toothache!
@TMI_Source we need a Shadowhunter phone chain in case people are offline for things like this! #WhoIsClary
@ShadowhuntersTV I love how @arosende already feels like a perfect Simon. #Shadowhunters #WhoIsClary
@TMI_Source can't breathe #Shadowhunters #WhoIsClary
@ShadowhuntersTV squeeeeee! #WhoIsClary #whatisair
I love how @StuartCamp doesn't pretend to be into the things much of @edsheeran's fan base is. Straight up honesty is a treasure.
@TheMarySue brings news today that rocks my world. Toby Froud!!!
Oh yeah also @NathanFillion @GeorgeTakei etc 

@TheMarySue I have been waiting to see Toby Froud's star rise! So excited - his mom made the Yoda puppet plus both parents Henson work <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Don't hate me but I feel this 1D/Zayn/NB drama is a way 1D is trying to help their sales with a drop in things for Four *ducks*
@whedonesque why vote for the lesser evil?
In my mind, @jasonpal_art does @Outlander_Starz artwork with @SamHeughan &amp; @caitrionambalfe so I can have it on my wall. The dream!
Also, this article's video with a song on how to fold a fitted sheet with a dog makes me think @maureenjohnson 
I want to see @feliciaday and @maureenjohnson try and out weird each other on the Internet. For science!
@blakcirclegirl my family's dog knows bath, walk, treat, snack, hungry, pee, ball &amp; most importantly he's excited when told 'Lara's coming'
@jesserath please yes! Can we let comic book based movies be fun too while we're at it!
@SamMaggs geez your life sounds rough!
I think they found the biggest pretentious high school douchebag wanna be culinary critic review in boy form for last night's #HellsKitchen
@maureenjohnson is it better than being on hold to a staticky radio station playing commercials?
Dying inside freaking out catching up on #AgentsofSHIELD OMG!
@vancejoy you and Taylor win at covering each other's songs
Catching up on @AgentsofSHIELD and @HellsKitchenFOX this morning since there were election results and implications last night to follow
Well played @X929. Well played. If this morning's radio playlist doesn't make viral news somehow I will be sad.
@blakcirclegirl what's crucial is knowing how things link. Like in the movie no Raphael is no biggie for CoB but hit CoA and you're fucked
@blakcirclegirl this is what we need the adaptation team to understand with TMI we are starting with great books unlike so many series
@whedonesque I need new Whedonverse shows where we mighty Whedon fans come to watch without comic books as manuals or grading scales.
@blakcirclegirl compared to Twilight because of the "Twilight phenomenon" issue.
@blakcirclegirl Beautiful Creatures was really so different from the book it was nuts. Twilight... I think it best if nothing is ever again+
@blakcirclegirl we need an Alec to have chemistry with our Izzy and Jace - this may be the trickiest piece
@blakcirclegirl as anyone who saw Jupiter As ending knows, no chemistry in the leads makes film terrible.
@RogersonSean that's so awesome! Exciting times for you two soon it appears. <PARTY POPPER>
@blakcirclegirl it's not like casting waves a magic wand and the perfect actor appears like fans seem to think.
The statistical improbability of over 20,000 voters and an exact tie is mind boggling. It being my riding is even moreso. #abvote
@X929 @GrahamMosimann what scares me is how many people based on voter turnout probably care more about the Flames than the government.
@RachelNotley your speech tonight was gracious and inspiring. I am excited at the possibilities for change ahead.
@mikesbloggity If the recount is still a tie, by-election I assume right will unite &amp; I get Wild Rose cuz what good is a PC MLA 2 anyone now
@colbycosh hopefully that resolves it. Much better places to put money than by-elections.
@SuzetteChan it's hailing here - also normal
@SuzetteChan @colbycosh I'd assume a recount comes before they declare it really a tie?
@SuzetteChan @colbycosh noooooooooooo
@SuzetteChan @Belen_Ariana it better go my way!
@SuzetteChan @Belen_Ariana recount I'm assuming. I also have the shame of living in Harper's riding.
@SuzetteChan @Belen_Ariana all polls now in and an exact tie. I hate my PC MLA and have spoken with her at length. 
@SuzetteChan @Belen_Ariana Calgary Glenmore. With one more polling station now NDP is ahead by 80 but 800 votes from v right wing area left.
@SuzetteChan @Belen_Ariana my riding is exactly tied NDP and PC with 1000 of 34,000 left to come in so I predict full recount. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@mikesbloggity looks like #CalgaryGlenmore is facing a full recount 
@Belen_Ariana I am so excited and stunned! @SuzetteChan
@Belen_Ariana representing "Canada's Texas" here lol
@davidswann is 100% class. Well spoken Sir. Please, stick around. We need you. I heard you speak many years ago and your words stuck with me
@mikesbloggity gonna take his toys and go home and pout.
Prentice's speech makes me want to vomit. So long and thanks for nothing.
That moment when you stare at the tv screen and freak out in realization your high school BFF's sister is now an NDP MLA!
I'm old.
@mikesbloggity I can't believe what I'm seeing on CBC right now!
Am I dreaming looking at these results in the Alberta election? My riding might go to who I voted for which would be a first for me!
@TobiasMenzies waiting for a superhero symbol to be drawn on that bulk?
@A_SunnySpot managed to see that this morning when it was at 300ish views by accident. Should get fans excited now they've cross-covered
@yasizacrob ooh yay it will be lots of fun... Unless the Chapstick melted and escaped tubes, but should be great!
@FizzleCollins we need to teach them to be straight with us.
@demijolras Marvel plots to delay Sherlock forever at this point?
@FizzleCollins I like games but when they fall apart I want them to be honest about it.
@FizzleCollins maybe instead of deleting the tweets they could've said sorry, change of plans?!
@TMI_Source so, no casting announced today?
I hope TV Magnus will be more his flashy confrontational self. Movie Magnus was all fatherly and did things to help and didn't ask for pay.
@ATravelingBook at this point I'm more inclined to think it a hitch in the plans than intended @ShadowhuntersTV @McGsWonderland
When I see things like this 
“@ClubFandemonium: @birdkittyme @TMI_TID_UK ugh naysayers ruin everything” yes!!! All the time and all the things. Like the show will suck.
@TMI_TID_UK @ClubFandemonium oh that is flattering, but alas once that starts happening so do the naysayers.
@TMI_TID_UK @ClubFandemonium between ourselves is different to me than tagging the actor. Between ourselves I'm all for it.
@ClubFandemonium guessing is good until you @ the actor and then I think too much of it isn't cool.
Promise of Clary today by @ShadowhuntersTV was deleted. Pics tweeted by @McGsWonderland were deleted. I'm guessing no Clary today.
@ClubFandemonium I'm on the small soap box of "don't tweet to who you want cast or think is cast until it's confirmed bc feelings of humans"
@FizzleCollins Alec needs chemistry with Izzy, Simon and Magnus. Magnus only needs chemistry with Alec. No Clary required for either.
Either Clary quit or the zillion tweets to who we thought was Clary pissed someone off, I think... #WhoIsClary
@FizzleCollins I think she quit.
@FizzleCollins @McGsWonderland I begin to think that we will never know #WhoIsClary

@A_SunnySpot Loft 89 is life goals @taylorswift13
@A_SunnySpot I thought the Speak Now bit would be Mine bc she did a pop version of that
@A_SunnySpot we will drive ourselves psychotic over why Wonderland didn't make it and You Belong With Me was her first pop song.
@A_SunnySpot I guess OOTW and Shake It Off was the encore?
@TMIScotland In 3 months I'll have seen it. You see it sooner lucky girl! @TMI_TID_UK @taylorswift13
@A_SunnySpot if Wonderland is the only song left off it'll be lonely, but this is just amazing
@A_SunnySpot that was the last song of the encore of Speak Now, so last song I saw her sing.

@A_SunnySpot in the huge crowd and only like 100 people.
@A_SunnySpot the meet and greets beforehand are usually who she's noticed and who have the right connections, afterwards it's who stands out
@A_SunnySpot and it feels unfair that it's the same ones over and over
@A_SunnySpot I just don't even try because it's not worth it and I think I say things as clever and fun as the ones who get noticed
@anerdgirlsays I registered on the Sugar Daddies dating website way back when it was a thing and I'm not that ashamed to admit it
@anerdgirlsays if it meant retiring with him in Maui with big $ ok yeah I'd go for that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Otherwise just no.
#1989TourTokyo is trending second in Canada @taylornation13
@A_SunnySpot all the sold out stuff makes me stress about not having the exclusive pre-shopping platinum package!
Let's rock voter turnout in Alberta on May 5. Show your support by adding a #Twibbon now! 
@TMI_TID_UK since McG had said Monday before the weekend I'm wondering if it's a case of needing someone's signature inked on a contract
@A_SunnySpot time and money and figure are in the way of me pulling off anything like this.
@McGsWonderland are you looking to see the movie set and figure out what's usable, scouting locations or casting?
@purpleiris13 it's ok Rihanna brought enough to cover them all up.
@TMIToronto I got cured of my taste for Stampede by working there selling souvenirs once when in high school. Guaranteed cure.
@TMIToronto @MundieMoms and our national sport lacrosse is super exciting and intense when played in an indoor arena!
@TMIToronto for the record, I've only gone to the event twice in the last 15 years and never for the freaky food.
@TMIToronto Calgary Stampede makes a big deal of having new whacky sensational foods each year that last usually just that year. Weirdness.
@TMIToronto @MundieMoms also $100 "world's most expensive hotdogs" and many other bizarre things.
@MarkRuffalo @SamMaggs @thordinsons this! All the this!
@McGsWonderland you wicked man! @cassieclare don't let him near @sarahreesbrenna I'm afraid the combined love of angst could be catastrophic
@pretareporter Beyoncé could use to borrow some of that fabric
@MundieMoms @TMIToronto I have to say I am not lining up to try that. People will pay to try anything sensational I guess?
@TMIToronto @MundieMoms I don't know! This year on the Midway at Calgary Stampede they are selling cockroach pizza. And that's in Canada!
@TMI_Australia I'm just worried if it's not right, how has/will tagging the actress all day have impacted her? <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
If I'm slowly dying of cancer I'm actually ok with that so long as I know one way or the other so I could plan out my life.
@TMIToronto and @MundieMoms love hairy legged tarantulas. I'm sure they'll be glad to know served deep fried they're a delicacy in places
@AskEmilyExpo of course you have other interests, you may be our Expo mascot but you're also a living breathing human!
@TMI_Australia @TMIToronto I'm honestly a little concerned how 100% sure many people are on the Clary though no issue if that is the actress
In a day full of personal downs, this is the silver lining. I <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ it so much! 
Disagreeing with development of a character: ok
Deciding that one character's development says everything about the director: sheer idiocy
@Jimmydoubleyou if you are also a fan of harmless pranks, I think we'll get along wonderfully
@ChloeBennet4 for $25K Per ticket, I hope they get drunk and play Twister
@TMIToronto @Jimmydoubleyou @McGsWonderland hey Jimmy, do you take bribes btw? <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS> (we all know I'm totally kidding, but I had to)
@SamMaggs if the rest of the world saw the movie the way you did (or I did) Joss might've felt differently. #ISupportJossWhedon
@Jimmydoubleyou @TMIToronto @McGsWonderland have a safe flight. Good to know McG has all night to plot how to plot and tease #Shadowhunters
@whedonesque how people who live on this world believe they can treat others. People are the problem.
All you ha…
@SamMaggs toss the blame at someone else game!
@JPSargeant78 @whedonesque the part where people say Joss Whedon is a mysogynist who hates strong female characters shows such ignorance <POUTING FACE>
@Colleen614 @TMI_TID_UK after these they still have a ton to announce!
@TMI_TID_UK @Colleen614 Friday is 1/2 day lots of places, Monday.., hmmm ok no excuses
@TMI_TID_UK @Colleen614 Friday though?
@TMI_TID_UK @Colleen614 can't trend WW when the US is in a standard workday with a younger fan base IMO
@TMI_TID_UK true, but since casting is LA based...
@all_things_hp it does indeed!
@TMI_TID_UK it's not even 2 pm in LALAland so they don't get it!
@all_things_hp @clarysparabatai what is wrong with this world where everyone and everything precious gets hate???
@NephilimSweden @TMI_TID_UK she looks the part, but not sure it's her
@Oregonunicorn jealousy just sucks doesn't it? #OneUnicornOutlander
@yasizacrob they need the onscreen dynamic, but off-screen they just need to rub along well enough
@yasizacrob ooh Magnus, Dominic and Emeraude - that's really putting the squeeze on.
@yasizacrob looking like a sibling to Emeraude AND having the right chemistry with a Magnus could get twitchy
Also, Alec is my fave!
#Shadowhunters! Don't be sure we know who Clary is as at the end of the day if you're wrong, feelings could be hurt! #WhoIsClary
@TheMarySue appalled that it comes to this yet again for a celeb on Twitter.
@Catreads @TMIScotland @TMI_TID_UK @DutchNephilim @McGsWonderland @jonclayharris this is my thought bc those aren't the same person
Did McG just give us a bit of Clary and then a bit of Jocelyn?
I think thinking any one actress is for sure Clary right now is premature...
@McGsWonderland you Sir are a diabolical tease! @cassieclare @ShadowhuntersTV
@FizzleCollins my fancast is on another project so I have no guesses! I just want to know but I'm wondering if she'll be announced last.
All these theories about #WhoIsClary are driving me nuts! #IntoTheFray
@whedonesque what????? Is this over people misconstruing what (I think) he actually meant and being horrid?
@FizzleCollins could be onto something, her IMDb doesn't have height and I want short girls to be represented!
@AlexisDenisof well, you know you married a smart one ;) @alydenisof
@VisitGraceland so cool! @edsheeran @Hozier did you two plan to dress in the same style or did it just happen? <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@TMIScotland I'm guessing no news til North American high school is done for the day, so a few hours
@TMIScotland I don't want fans reactions disappointing Cassie again
@TMIScotland if I see a spot of hate at whomever is cast as Clary not being as good, I'm going to get ugly fast
@indigogreenroom @501stLegion which Calgary store?!
@McGsWonderland we have two Frays... #WhoIsClary #WhoIsJocelyn
@TMIScotland yes!!! @DomSherwood1 @arosende @EmeraudeToubia @ShadowhuntersTV
@taylorswift13 @edsheeran wish you two had more banter on here, now I know you hide it from us.
@Wolf_Pack_Pride I choose all our pack men #WolfPackPride how can I pick one for #ManCrushMonday when variety is the spice of life?
OMG! @ShiriAppleby is to be on my tv June 1? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> loved her since 1999! Can't wait for #UnReal now (I think that's what it is?) @showcasedotca
@blakcirclegirl I've not tried to sell clothing or anything online, though I need to learn how.
@mrblckdmnd I rarely find advertising that gets my attention in a good way, but this felt like "car buying so easy girls can do w/o men omg"
So, it's been proven Horrocks is complete scum - kinda different take from the books on The Watch, too #OutlanderCAN
@mrblckdmnd the two women in girl speak of some kind then taking off w/o talking to the men @autoTRADER_ca @showcasedotca
@bearmccreary does the score for @Outlander_Starz and @AgentsofSHIELD? Worlds collide! #UnsungHeroesOfTV #SeeWhatIDidThere
That @autoTRADER_ca commercial just on @showcasedotca I found insulting to intelligent women watching #OutlanderCAN
@blakcirclegirl I have a huge pile of "when I lose my next 15 lbs" clothes ordered from online
@ABOotlanders to stay or to go? #OutlanderCAN
@Belen_Ariana 
Because I never give up.
@blakcirclegirl sometimes things are way too big for me, other times way too small. Drives me nuts!
@clara_deee great minds think alike!
@KristinDSantos so the deal works out to @SamHeughan dressing up as Hook bc he won and @colinodonoghue1 dressing up as Jamie bc he lost? <WINKING FACE>
@birdkittyme obvs I'm talking about the commercials, gotta add the naughty secrets to fix yer husband's attention to this commercial offense
Vitamins for 50+ and frozen dinners that pretend to be healthy and pads for bladder leakage. Who do they think watches #OutlanderCAN FFS!?
Yes Ian! That so needed to be done, even if it was risky! #OutlanderCAN
#Shadowhunters our Simon just tweeted about #MayTheFourth am I the only one shrieking in happiness?
@blakcirclegirl it's too early for such a drastic measure IMO.
@blakcirclegirl hallway, which begs 'steal me' to the people walking past all day.
@blakcirclegirl hmm. Anyone you see often enough? For no signature big $ my parents place is better bc it's a house. Here it's flung in the
Jenny is so pragmatic in the face of all this! #OutlanderCAN
@blakcirclegirl hopefully last as well!
@blakcirclegirl the sleeves aren't tight so that won't overheat you and I know I love an arm covered outfit.
@blakcirclegirl ugh. Since Amazon uses UPS who CBA to buzz my apartment, I get stuff shipped to someone else's house. Else I have to pick up
@blakcirclegirl from your front step?
Ooh shit! #OutlanderCAN
@CatsandKilts jerks with warped senses of "funny" <POUTING FACE>
People much worse at lying about who someone is: children. #OutlanderCAN
“@showcasedotca: Does Jamie know how to tread lightly? #TheWatch #Outlander #OutlanderCAN”
I'd go with no <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CatsandKilts I keep wondering what @grahammctavish thought of Jamie's alias when he found out
Yay it's finally time #OutlanderCAN @showcasedotca
@ClubFandemonium I can't go celebrate the book (though I met her at Calgary Expo) so I need to live vicariously through Torontonians!
@KristinDSantos didn't you get @SamHeughan first to agree to dress up as Hook if he lost, but then if he won? #ISeeWhatYouDidThere
@ClubFandemonium 
@SamMaggs you know that spoilery thing involving Black Widow that you think people are misunderstanding? My TL is full of Joss hate about it
Wow, I think that many many people have a different interpretation of that think Nat says in AoU that is a spoiler but all over my TL
@greystonh someone entrepreneurial should make that.
@greystonh <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> what happens if you mix beer &amp; Metamucil?
@draiochta14 mine is just chilling too 
@maureenjohnson 11 hours after labour and emergency c-section, I had an IV in each arm still
@maureenjohnson i mean to say that other than walking in heels, she was treated like a Barbie doll to look like that.
@maureenjohnson she has a person that does said hair and clothing for her.
@_TakeMeToChvrch fingers crossed!
@maureenjohnson this shall be your epitaph
@_TakeMeToChvrch here pharmacies are open 7 days a week, even bank holidays. Is it that they're closed or just no deliveries until Tuesday?

@TMIexaminer @ShadowhuntersTV I think after seeing the little videos that these are fantastic choices for the characters!

Watching the American #WolfPack tweet about #BittenS2 is awesome. Enjoy every second of it! #Bitten #WolfPackPride #renewBitten @bittentv
@maureenjohnson @cassieclare @arosende in lieu of Cassie, Alberto meet Maureen, Simon's biggest fan ever. A very formidable creative genius.
@TMIScotland @cassieclare if Izzy had the power to create runes, the first one would be a "stop being stupid" rune.
@TMIScotland @cassieclare we can't fix stupid apparently.
@cassieclare @KxtieMxrie he totally could work as Robert Lightwood
@ATravelingBook instead of a blue Persian cat he might be a Tuxedo cat and that'd ruin the whole thing.
Spoiler: the part of Church will be played by a dog #Shadowhunters 
(Not really but keep your heads out of your asses people)
@Belen_Ariana @ATravelingBook unfortunately racism is still a universal problem and I can't fix it.
@SageHillfarms @GrantORourke @AnneDenissen also, do you eat said sandwich in pajamas?
@ClubFandemonium as someone teased as a child for facial moles, I love that our Izzy has one, while we're airing issues.
@cassieclare @ATravelingBook @hollyblack I don't think you're an idiot. Your books found me in my darkest time and brought some light!
@ClubFandemonium I also wonder why so much more issue with Izzy than with Simon?
@ATravelingBook @hollyblack @cassieclare <PERSEVERING FACE> don't ever accept it, even if it seems to be stupidly common
@hollyblack @cassieclare and many of us are horribly ashamed and embarrassed by the reactions.
@RavenDarkholem @cassieclare IMO the essence of a character isn't related to skin colour.
"How do you take someone Hispanic and make them look paler as a vampire?"
Same way you'd make someone white paler as a vampire - makeup.
@SageHillfarms I'm thinking I want a burger at this point. Ban food captchas!
@SageHillfarms pasta!
@SageHillfarms and sushi?
@ClubFandemonium I feel like crying. I'm so embarrassed for the fandom and we've just had perfect 18 seconds that back up that Simon casting
@epic_egg @cassieclare tons of people complained. They've been still complaining up til the new cast. It's all sad. Acting is what matters.
@Belen_Ariana I know!!! It's perfect!
@cassieclare @dessywinsy <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I'm so upset about this!
We all want the actors to look like the characters did in our heads, but I think they fall well within that range!
@EmeraudeToubia welcome! I can't wait to see you as Izzy - hope you like high heels! #Shadowhunters
@TMI_TID_UK @EmeraudeToubia I'm really disappointed seeing the negativity. We are a worldwide fandom and casting is reflecting this.
@arosende is going to be an amazing Simon! @ShadowhuntersTV #Shadowhunters 
@SamMaggs @TheMarySue I'm in agreement with you on pretty much everything you said especially your take on the Black Widow spoiler stuff
@TMI_TID_UK totally optimistic. If Cassie is happy then there's no reason to not think the best. And Alberto with glasses is so Simon!
@cassieclare @BestTMIQuotes @ShadowhuntersTV @ShdwHntrChat exactly!
@cassieclare I find your happiness reassuring. Exciting!
If you think Hispanic actors can't play Izzy or Simon, block me now please.
@stanascollins we'll have to wait until we get teaser trailers for that
@stanascollins I think we need to see speech and movement patterns to find Izzy or not
@anerdgirlsays apparently some people are horrible.
@FizzleCollins I don't want to fall for any more script rumours. Not believing anything not from Cassie, McG or Decter directly.
@DomSherwood1 things are coming together! @EmeraudeToubia @arosende #Shadowhunters
@TMIScotland @ShadowhuntersTV @obellakouinoa he is so Simon in that picture!
Came home to exciting news! Welcome @arosende and @EmeraudeToubia to @ShadowhuntersTV #Shadowhunters
@ShadowhuntersTV please have McG's Monday be #WhoIsClary!!!
@McGsWonderland Monday is #WhoIsClary?
Everyone needs to see #AvengersAgeOfUltron now!
OMG #AvengersAgeOfUltron was the best ever! I need the next Marvel movie now!
9:15 am and 15 min until I see #AvengersAgeOfUltron @CineplexMovies!
Will tweet after if I survive.
(It's @josswhedon so you never know)
@TMI_TID_UK i think you're right because we KNOW they've auditioned for Clary and I think the one is a Shadowhunter is ambiguous 4 Clary
@dessywinsy that's where we're all at! #Outlander #WentworthAhead
@dessywinsy @ShadowhuntersTV clearly, we kick ass! #Shadowhunters #WhoIsClary #WhoIsSimon
@Belen_Ariana I am glad they quickly decided they couldn't trend in the US with the NFL draft lol
@Belen_Ariana I think we know they did the Jace &amp; Clary reads so we're 95% sure on Clary and Jace
@dessywinsy I told @ShadowhuntersTV it was tomorrow somewhere! It's Friday for you right?
@dessywinsy I hope @cassieclare is getting the @ShadowhuntersTV news before we do. It would be wrong otherwise! (Hope she got input too!)
@ATravelingBook + they've done Clary with Jace readings
@ATravelingBook that's what I'm going with and clue 2 was just to screw with our heads. It could only otherwise bc Clary &amp; Alec bc we know+
@ATravelingBook that only works if we count Clary as a Shadowhunter bc clue 2 is 1 is a Shadowhunter but I think you're right!
So @ShadowhuntersTV is going to release clues and casting the day Age of Ultron comes out in North America. Epic timing distractions!
“@cassieclare: Whew! The clues are up! I am not. *sleeps* #shadowhunters”
Night night Cassie
Guess that's all for tonight...
Clary is technically a Shadowhunter but she doesn't know it... This is confusing! #Shadowhunters
“@cassieclare: Man, NFLDraft, why you gotta be tonight? #shadowhunters”
@ShadowhuntersTV you give us no breaks! #Shadowhunters
Trend it before your bedtime EST fans! #Shadowhunters
@cassieclare and even if it kills us, death isn't the end #Shadowhunters (Jace, Sebastian, Simon, every other vampire)
@jonclayharris @McGsWonderland &amp; @ShadowhuntersTV are laughing at us right now #Shadowhunters
It's tomorrow somewhere by now #Shadowhunters @ShadowhuntersTV
Have a little faith in @McGsWonderland #Shadowhunters
TMI fans around the globe want the clues to #WhoIsClary #WhoIsSimon (hopefully those are the two) #Shadowhunters
It's late and I'm still waiting for dinner, which I'm not making tonight for once.
#Shadowhunters 
(Like I said, on everything so we trend)
I'm just going to put #Shadowhunters onto everything I tweet
We will fight for clues @ShadowhuntersTV #Shadowhunters
“@ClubFandemonium: Let's do this  #Shadowhunters !!!!!”
We've waited a long time for this! #Shadowhunters
@wahf731 I think we get a clue tonight but announcements tomorrow #Shadowhunters
@cassieclare @1dgIow but Cassie, you do take delight in teasing us #Shadowhunters but idk if you're in on the secrets right now or not
I need to know now at least who we're finding out is cast! #Shadowhunters
@anerdgirlsays @ShadowhuntersTV hoping tomorrow we find who joins @DomSherwood1 in our fave angstful confusing relationship #Shadowhunters
@wahf731 shhh I'm going to get too excited to sleep lol #Shadowhunters
I hope Cassie knows already but I won't ask her #Shadowhunters 
Casting news!
“@wahf731: #Shadowhunters  we want a clue”
We need the clues else we'll not sleep! #Shadowhunters
@ShadowhuntersTV but I need the #Shadowhunters casting announcements now!!!
@whedonesque ummm spoiler on the giant encyclopedia and Dutch oven flinging by Inhuman children battle in Age of Ultron? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CineplexMovies tonight sold out too fast, glad tomorrow morning got added.
@SamHeughan a very happy birthday to you. Let me know how 35 is since I'll be there in a few months. <BIRTHDAY CAKE><COCKTAIL GLASS>
@Ligxhtwood the advice to not see the next AoS episode until after AoU will fill theatres this weekend, but yeah usually 1 month to spoilers
I thought @DomSherwood1 would make a good Jace, it took 19 seconds of video for me to be sure he will! #ShadowhuntersTV
@Ligxhtwood there's a reason I'm going to the 9:30 am showing the day it comes out but I have no interest in spoiling anyone!
@jonclayharris perfect quote for us letting @ShadowhuntersTV settle into what it was meant to be!
@Ligxhtwood AoU comes out tomorrow in North America so not sure how useful it really is to see The AoS first except freaking in excitement
@SamMaggs @Marvel the only #BlackWidow merch we've seen is @CineplexMovies cup topper
@Ligxhtwood supposed to see this week's AoS before seeing AoU for maximum viewing #priorities
I got: A Year!  
Ok, I'm not cannon fodder in GoT but I'm not going to live a long life either...
@dessywinsy it's not romance, as the author has said so many times. It's the story of a marriage. Most romances end at marriage.
@dessywinsy blasphemy to even compare!
@josswhedon nothing can stop you from being you. And that's what I love most about you. Never change!

@FizzleCollins no one will ever love a prop ring like Jamie
@McGsWonderland I think the real question about @ShadowhuntersTV is whether the scripts people are making claims about are authentic.
@cassieclare no need to be sorry as anyone paying attention knows you're not in charge of the TV. They can ask @McGsWonderland about it!
If Decter had social media he'd have quit the Shadowhunters project by now or be in an insane asylum
I mean, they believed the last leaked thing to be real then it was declared by an authority to be complete BS, so no credibility. Done 4 now
Just because someone is completely sure the illegally leaked version of something they have is legitimate doesn't mean it's not BS.

@SageHillfarms @drsmit6 let's face it, despite the innocuous reason for it, we'll never look at Vaseline the same way. Switching 2 generic.
@Summer_Glau_com @chrisdvanne Summer and Val are such an amazing couple, totally a relationship goal
@mikesbloggity if I were a wagering sort, I'd lay a lot of money on the line that Prentice is a master of uncomfortable touch
Dear #AppleWatch it doesn't matter how many ads I see, you're still way too expensive!
@AskEmilyExpo love @EspionageMakeup! So much money spent though <WINKING FACE>
#AskOutlander trended 4th in Canada. Good job fellow Canadian fans! #Outlander
@2458GP I suspect it may be the same company of origin then. If so, their quality is really high as I own other stuff from them.
@charper5 after the next blood work if the appointment isn't going to be sooner and things aren't better, likely heading to a Montana Dr
@nenshi 59 taxes raised blah blah blah blah
@charper5 long past time for a change! I waited 3 years for a rheumatologist and now it's 8 months to see if I have CLL, a type of leukaemia
@charper5 + so we can't let foreign nurses begin working as nurses bc we are too short on nurses to spare nurses to train nurses.
@charper5 heartbreaking. I had a friend from Slovakia waiting to be certified for her RN here but no RN for her to pair with to certify +
@charper5 funding insulin pumps for children should never be something with a wait list to start with!
@SpineyLobsters will be talking to my local candidate.
So if I want my 8 month wait for hematology shortened, who should I vote for? #abvote #abpoli
@AYLiberals @ABLiberal I have a long history of admiration for @davidswann dating back before his political career. #abpoli
@nenshi secret plan: no more publicly funded health care, instead an unlimited supply of ketchup Doritos for all?
@2458GP saw ones just like this for sale at the Comic Expo locally last weekend. $300 CAD or about £150 with exchange.
@sass_swift lol. It was on behalf of the traumas my daughter has gone through that we got the meet &amp; greet so it was bittersweet.
@sass_swift we saw Speak Now and got a meet &amp; greet so that'll always have first place I my heart though I'm super excited for 1989!
@sass_swift Red wasn't coming anywhere within a day's drive of us, then they added the date when I was lost bc grandma died so we missed it.
@sass_swift that sounds like good reasoning. Are you seeing Taylor?
@sass_swift money ruins all things fun. Might be better to save it for the next announced concert for someone you've not seen this year.
@sass_swift also, I'm expecting him to get the Global Influence Brit Award next year that Sam Smith got this year, so we must all contribute
@sass_swift @edsheeran @StuartCamp you want to see Ed because the opportunity to see and hear Ed isn't to be passed up.
55 days and 19 hours remaining until Ed Sheeran Calgary!!!
(I may be a bit excited) @edsheeran @StuartCamp 
@TMIexaminer scrawny and scrappy and short!
@MundieMoms I wish people would read @cassieclare's previous tweets before asking things!
@blakcirclegirl it's past time to get gender issues past where they were in the 50's or even in the 70's!
@vancejoy @taylorswift13 Georgia, From Afar, Riptide, Mess is Mine, The Best That I Can!
See you in Edmonton Aug 4! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<YELLOW HEART><BLUE HEART><PURPLE HEART><GREEN HEART>
@blakcirclegirl epic!
@edsheeran OMG just take all my money now!
@AnneWheaton people are sometimes horrible and it saddens me. The drama related to Expo really saddened me. I'm proud of how Expo handled it
Apparently I'm reducing my carbon footprint on #EarthDay by sleeping in til 2 pm. Oops?
@McGsWonderland @cassieclare @ShadowhuntersTV @TMI_Source ooh the magical chemistry test reading?
@SageHillfarms <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I want all the good things for everyone on @AgentsofSHIELD and it looks like none of them are even close to happening! <PERSEVERING FACE>
@MingNa it was the perfectly wrong answer to "what has Coulson been up to!" @clarkgregg @IMBrettDalton
Bad Ward! Go back in the cell until you can figure out a way to redeem yourself. #AgentsofSHIELD
Heart is breaking for Cal right now! #AgentsofSHIELD
Just let Skye have a proper family damnit! #AgentsofSHIELD
It's hard to believe the 1.6 lb 7 week old tail wagging puppy has become the 13 lb dog who did a 10 minute happy dance to see me  Sunday
@jerilynsimons it was a good instalment all around, too. I felt that dash of Maureen in there, I think.
What a difference 2 years makes! Wembley April 21 2013 (day after he came home) to recent <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
@cassieclare @jerilynsimons and now anyone who was planning on waiting for a physical copy of TFSA is buying the latest eBook segment!
Ran into someone with a button with Prentice's face and the PC logo in my building just now and I'm proud I didn't kick her down the stairs
@NDPMikeC @mikesbloggity better eating contests than drinking contests. The dream is still intelligent questions in the ears of open minds.
@ATravelingBook people wanted Daniel Sharman and I love him but he's Will not Jace to me.
@ATravelingBook I'd never have thought of him independently, but in the pic Cassie put on Instagram I so see it.
I think anyone asking @cassieclare how she feels about Jace casting after she tweeted it was her fave owes her a dollar.
Can't go without saying @ShadowhuntersTV is never going to go out of Style @DomSherwood1
I bet it's been said lots already today.
@cassieclare I think as soon as we knew @McGsWonderland was going to be the boss of the show we knew we were in good hands
The Whitechapel Fiend has landed in iBooks Canada! #SoExcited @cassieclare
@maureenjohnson @cassieclare @Ginny_theQueen now I gotta stay up til it hits iBooks in North America...
@ATravelingBook as a Swiftie I've been admiring that shirtless chest for months <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> good idea!
@cassieclare @clxckworkangel yes, a thousand yeses!
Dry wit, ban the cheesy lines.
@cityofdevices he's different enough from Jamie that it doesn't feel like he's a less expensive or direct replacement.
@cityofdevices it's ok to love Jamie more and yet be open to a new Jace
@yasizacrob <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
We cannot let #DougalMcKenzie miss out on having his lassies as well! #Outlander
Graham McTavish is… 
@Vale_Asencio alas, he quit Misfits early over deciding TV is boring. He's in our hearts always, though I think.
@Vale_Asencio last interviews I've seen, Robbie doesn't want to do more TV series - wasn't TMI specific, before This TV series was announced
I don't think @Jamiebower would want us to do anything but love him as Jace but yet want us to give no hate and a full chance to TV Jace
@TMIScotland i love our original cast, but I am relieved this first asking announcement is ok in my head
Anyone else crying because they feel that @DomSherwood1 will make a great Jace? #Shadowhunters #DomisJace @cassieclare @McGsWonderland
@ShadowhuntersTV @DomSherwood1 welcome! I can see you as Jace after seeing your acting and also your gorgeousness in @taylorswift13's Style!
@SageHillfarms in CAD that's what it amounts to. Hugh Jackman auctioned the shirt off his back at a Broadway musical... Imagine but Sam!
@SageHillfarms $30 K equivalent for the Sam sweat <OK HAND SIGN>
@Calgaryexpo @AskEmilyExpo I had an amazing weekend. I really felt that every attempt was made to solve last year's challenging areas <THUMBS UP SIGN><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I cannot believe I'm saying this, but now I'm finally home I'm too worn out for Outlander tonight. Saving for tomorrow!
How can I have no likes on my Graham McTavish photo? What is wrong with my Outlander Fanmily???
Fear the Beard! #Outlander #CalgaryExpo (I'm looking a wee bit worn out) 
Oh @AjayFry and @TeddyWilson there's already a substantial #CalgaryExpo line for your #InnerSpace panel! (No pressure) @SpaceChannel
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms today is the third and alas the last day for me to enjoy admiring live Graham in a kilt
@drsmit6 good. And Graham hasn't let it affect him - he's still wearing kilts!@SageHillfarms
@SageHillfarms I did specify awesome brother @MrRolandJohnson
@SageHillfarms at risk of massive ego deflation I'll say my feelings for @MrRolandJohnson are those for an awesome little brother
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms Graham is having a great time here this weekend so I'm hoping he'll tell his friends <WINKING FACE>
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms they are very strict here about how we treat guests! SDCC is often mandatory for casts bc it's so huge
@drsmit6 from stories I've heard can be very hard to get one if they are and can't be counted on. @SageHillfarms
@SageHillfarms well I think @MrRolandJohnson should just be happy we're not cougar crushing on him!
@SageHillfarms @drsmit6 SDCC is often mandatory for stars but next to no chance to get to meet or even ask a Q
@SageHillfarms @drsmit6 we're going to have to see if after this round of filming Sam starts doing cons. Fans best behave so he does!
Day 4 will take all the caffeine and under eye dark circle makeup. Let's do this thing! #CalgaryExpo
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms hard to predict. It's all personal preference. We got last minute surprise of Neil Patrick Harris here this round!
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms I think when things get too big, it's too hard. I'm happy with the size of the con here. Just right.
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms @Comic_Con so it's a question of what kind of lineups and madness of all the things to try and got in.
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms every con is different. @Comic_Con is an unbelievingly massive event on a mind boggling scale from what I understand
@JurassicPark I wish this could be real but without things going wrong at the park
@MingNa @RobbieAmell @NickNicotera shhh don't tell Marvel and DC about this mingling!
@WardsWarriors admiring the trust @MingNa and @IMBrettDalton placed in #CalgaryExpo fans!
So @Calgaryexpo my Saturday per my pedometer had 11,679 steps and an estimated walking distance of 8.15 km. Wow!
This may be the best picture of Alex and I ever! #CalgaryExpo @RattyBurvil #Whovians #DoctorWho #DontBlink 
@IvyDoomkitty thank you so much for your positivity panel! There need to be more of these around <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
The lineup for #AgentsofSHIELD at #CalgaryExpo is massive! It's like we think @MingNa and @IMBrettDalton in a panel would rock! (We so do)
@Belen_Ariana me or @IMBrettDalton? <WINKING FACE>
#StandWithWard kinda literally @IMBrettDalton you're awesome #CalgaryExpo #AgentsofSHIELD 
Made it to Body Positivity and Cosplay panel! #CalgaryExpo
If you have the opportunity to sit in a tin fish and you don't take it, I'm judging you. #CalgaryExpo 
@drsmit6 I'll be busy tonight fortunately
Keep noticing all this cleavage re-adjustment many female cosplayers seem to need to do. Looks like lots of effort!
@leven_stund dying from cuteness overload
@drsmit6 and Canada doesn't get til tomorrow 10 EST
@mikesbloggity the full panel?
I think she's enjoying #Unspoken 
Deluxe perk of getting in early: awesome
Bonus perk of waiting inside: priceless!
@Calgaryexpo
To those hating on #CalgaryExpo over something we don't have full info on, fuck you and go organize your own convention.
Mini me representing @wearedeified for #CalgaryExpo this morning 
It's cold and it's dark and it's time to make with the caffeine because it's a #CalgaryExpo day!!!
Unless it's essential to have them in my life, I don't! #HowICopeWithIdiots
@SchniekeMona @karenwest8 @JCB_addicted @wahl_kathrin @AnitaPoulsen86 @CamillaOlufson have a lovely gig ladies!
So @blamebetty we have the Neil Patrick Harris stamp of approval on @AskEmilyExpo's flattering outfit today. Bragging rights all around?
Amazing panel with @ActuallyNPH a huge success @Calgaryexpo!
@grahammctavish is the most wonderful charming person! Thanks @Calgaryexpo for bringing him here <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@SageHillfarms Kim's pic is much better anyways
Graham pics are on a camera that's not a phone. Tonight I can post
I would've been the 1 in the unicorn hat screaming "hi Graham" at the #CalgaryExpo parade. Well worth it for smile and wave! @grahammctavish
It's a perfect parade morning! #CalgaryExpo #Calgary #yyc
@ABOotlanders sounds about right. I will survive through sheer will and all the caffeine.
@mikesbloggity the PC candidate's praise of Prentice's 10 year success plan for Alberta made me more in favour of not voting for her.
@ABOotlanders I'm counting my steps and stairs climbed for the weekend. I'm expecting it to be epic by my standards anyway. Sore today too!
First (much needed) caffeine of the day and the barista made me a heart in my latte! 
So this front page thing happened! Congrats @Calgaryexpo 
@jasonpal_art amazing!
@OrphanBlack cannot wait! I have so missed my #OrphanBlack
@AgentKalGibbs that's an amazing streak! Be proud of it!
@AgentKalGibbs I've had people tell me that I can't talk to them about certain things because they're triggers. It's a rough situation.
@AgentKalGibbs you have to have those boundaries! Keep them strong.
@AgentKalGibbs I'm way too far away. So sorry something's gone wrong.
Yes Jewel, it sure is! #CalgaryExpo 
@sass_swift I think for a much more active fan fiction writer the book would have a very different feel than for me.
My brain is still more interested in Neil Patrick Harris and Graham McTavish tomorrow than sleep.
@sass_swift I have, she hasn't yet. It was good but not quite to my taste.
@sass_swift @sarahreesbrenna raising a teenage Fangirl is like rocket science only with more screaming and door slamming.
@AnneWheaton welcome to my city. I hope to see you. Should I hunt for Vandal Eyes around #CalgaryExpo this weekend?
@sarahreesbrenna it might be worth mentioning the 30 minutes were while we were seated waiting for an event...
@sarahreesbrenna I thought you might enjoy this tactic. She loves Unspoken so far.
Every #CalgaryExpo will be the best one ever if you keep an open mind.
@grahammctavish @Calgaryexpo yay! Welcome to my amazing hometown. Hope you enjoy it. Can't wait to see you!
@Calgaryexpo I'm well aware it takes tons of work to run an event on this scale and that human behaviour isn't always predictable <WINKING FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
#TFIOS will never be quite the same now I've seen @lotteverbeek1's witchy semi-nude dancing on #Outlander
@Calgaryexpo for the first day with a new building and a new level of entry time added into the mix I think things went really well!
@Calgaryexpo I plan to fit it in tomorrow - seems all Deluxe pass holders figured today at 3:00 was the time to get it (or when they got in)
@Belen_Ariana 
Tape it! Fall in love!
@Calgaryexpo hate to complain but tried the Expo store repeatedly but lineups were cut-off - worried my size of the deluxe shirt will be out
Body is tired. Mind is saying Expo Expo Expo OMG
@McGsWonderland @ShadowhuntersTV @TMI_Source not the shade of his leash?
@Lovewords22 I'd only get 1. I'm more worried about my neighbours seeing me naked in my apt lol @SageHillfarms
@BreakawayDaily there will be I expect. I know someone's coming from Texas for @LanaParrilla
Better picture for my new alcohol drinking glass I don't know how I ever lived without. 
@BreakawayDaily met someone from London who flew to Calgary for the Expo.
@BreakawayDaily my one perceived perk of living in this conservative expensive city is the Expo. I think it's the best in Canada
@IMBrettDalton can I have a hug at my Saturday photo op? Not sure on your comfort zone #CalgaryExpo
@BreakawayDaily and it was free! Have a couple great ones from last year too.
@BreakawayDaily it is one of the best shows I have seen and it has all the different kinds of hot guys too! I love it.
@BreakawayDaily got this one too! 
@BreakawayDaily it was supposedly a Toronto ComicCon exclusive but my wishes and hopes were rewarded!
@Calgaryexpo a queue for Deluxe passes rather than the Corral and then a free for all would be much appreciated if possible, thanks!
Thanks @SpaceChannel for my kickass @bittentv poster at #CalgaryExpo 
#RenewBitten!!! 
Hard to get it to show in a picture but says "I'm a fan of all seven"
If you don't get it, you must watch Serenity 
@SageHillfarms @MrRolandJohnson maybe I shouldn't get the one with the bride's veil then? The voices in my head say "do it" though.
@JewelStaite thank you for an amazing panel. Dirt was spilled and all the smiling and laughing was wonderful!
@SageHillfarms however if I do buy a japanimation inspired stuffed alpaca, feeling the urge to name it Roland <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@MrRolandJohnson
@SageHillfarms it can collect dust with my Wicked flying monkey and Book of Mormon frog.
@OrphanBlack it's everywhere! Thanks @SpaceChannel for the #CalgaryExpo goodies 
I got the best pint glass ever from @ABbrowncoats #CalgaryExpo
@Oregonunicorn they don't have any for sale this year <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> doh!
The Agrium is an awesome shiny new building to add to #CalgaryExpo!
@SageHillfarms I liked the bride alpaca but am unsure wtf I'd do with it.
@SageHillfarms naturally. It's a whole booth of anime stuffed animals I don't recognize.
@SageHillfarms there's a brown one with a prize ribbon on his chest that says "hug me" lol
My daughter won't read @sarahreesbrenna bc it makes me cry. Just told her she can sit &amp; do nothing for 30 min or start Unspoken <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@SageHillfarms apparently there's some Japanese show with alpacas... There's even a bride alpaca plush. 
Found the cutest mini #Kaylee ever! (Taken with parental permission) 
Waiting for Jewel Staite #CalgaryExpo 
Asking for a friend. #Outlander

Neil Patrick Harris
Neil Patrick Harris?
Neil Patrick Harris!
Tomorrow! @Calgaryexpo @ActuallyNPH <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><PARTY POPPER>
Happy birthday to the amazing @Sean_M_Maher <BIRTHDAY CAKE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
So the @Calgaryexpo crew are amazing ninjas to pull out a screaming can't breathe last minute announcement of @ActuallyNPH #IsThisLife
@Calgaryexpo @ActuallyNPH this is so super insanely exciting!
@ABOotlanders I'll find you there then!
@ABOotlanders if I see a giant Jamie then I'll come running. Which might be embarrassing if it's the wrong people, but such is life
“@JewelStaite: CALGARY: my panel at @Calgaryexpo is TONIGHT at 630! Ready to spill some dirt. See you there. Xo” so very excited!
@Oregonunicorn <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@SageHillfarms ninja paca coloured canine too
@Oregonunicorn its occurred to me that mayhaps I have a hat you'd like ;) 
@CatsandKilts photo op on Sunday so he's getting a giant squishy hug unless he's not ok with it @ABOotlanders @Calgaryexpo @grahammctavish
@ABOotlanders I will be there somewhere rocking it like a pro. Perhaps I'll see you  @CatsandKilts @Calgaryexpo
@mikesbloggity I feel slightly ashamed to be Albertan seeing this.

Are the wives allowed to attend, or just their pies?
@Sabalaaa95 yeah, it's blamed on not enough women in the government here lol
@AnneWheaton have you ever tried doing this? You don't know it wouldn't work!
See you at #CalgaryExpo
@Sabalaaa95 ours is a goods and services tax that is supposed to exclude "essential items" but falls short of the definition of essential.
@SamMaggs @Calgaryexpo should I be Sam spotting starting today then?
@Sabalaaa95 here there's tax on tampons and condoms but not diapers. We've been fighting this for a decade.
@ABOotlanders I've got one I'd send one way trip to far away! Glad your relationship with yours is better!
@SpaceChannel oh no! @AjayFry and @TeddyWilson have their autograph session the same time as the #AgentsofSHIELD panel at #CalgaryExpo boo!
@dessywinsy who?
Only one more sleep til @JewelStaite at #CalgaryExpo!
Note to self: do not babble, keep it cool!
My @wearedeified buttons also made it onto my bag strap for #CalgaryExpo and no one will know what they are. 
Season 1 @OrphanBlack buttons from @SpaceChannel still safe and sound on the bag I'm using for #CalgaryExpo 
Trying to translate from dog whines and wags into human language is a complex process. It's like interpretive dance.
@cassieclare exciting 2 see torch of TMI book torture passed to the TV. Fangirls prefer agony or delight 2 mere contentment @McGsWonderland

@Calgaryexpo @TheRealStanLee we'll miss Stan but we were scared he wasn't feeling well and so glad that's not the case!
@GMcTavishArmy @CatsandKilts @grahammctavish only 2 sleeps for the panel, 4 for my photo op! #CalgaryExpo
@Calgaryexpo looks like Jewel Staite's panel leapt location to the Agrium in the last day or so?
@SageHillfarms nope! I'd be the same. Hopefully whomever it is has seen your thanks though.
@kebabfingers fancy shoes plus nipple protectors = that crazy dance party you never can quite remember <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Life tip: if you have all these weird sore bumps on your hair, don't dye it. That hurt, but I'm Expo ready now!
Looked up McG on IMDb and 90% of the fear I've had since Decter was announced is gone. He knows his stuff.
@McGsWonderland welcome to our Shadowhunter world. I'm looking forward to seeing you bring our precious stories to life!
This is not parade weather! Get with it nature 3 days to @Calgaryexpo #POWParade!
@Calgaryexpo also still has Brandon Routh and no Arthur Darvill, so I think I'm going to wait for an update to try and use it
@Calgaryexpo FYI people on iOS aren't finding the app if using an iPad bc they have to modify to search using "iPhone only" setting to find
@Lovewords22 doesn't like nap time interruptions and needs a bath lol
@Lovewords22 he just has a cold
@ashleybelikov lol it's not a woman as president you object to, it's that woman?
Needless to say, I won't be voting Conservative given my medical specialist wait time #abpoli
8 months is a very huge number of days to be seriously worried about my health for...
Went and voted in the Wards 11&amp;13 CBE School Trustee by-election. It was very empty. Hope people are voting on the way home. #yyc #Calgary
@CoeurDeCoquette I haven't tried using their calorie counter as the food database is American.
@simonkass @TallShipProds only if you sign in blood to take at least 100 instagram selfies of yourself getting drunk
Someone's not feeling so well today. Poor puppy. 
@MrsMcCharms it's very sneaky and silent and let's face it we all groan at the logo of the station and instead we have to look at it
@MrsMcCharms after the first and second commercials, look to the right corner and first it's the Showcase logo then they pop in the word.
4 sleeps til @Calgaryexpo <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@Raynor1917 I missed it my first watch last week, figured it'd be in the same space &amp; time this week <WINKING FACE>
@Raynor1917 sneaks into the bottom right corner after the end of the second commercial set next to the showcase logo last week and this one
Finally! #Outlander #OutlanderCAN @showcasedotca
@CatsandKilts no such thing possible when the marathon is less than 24 hours straight #WaitAFewYears
@MingNa @Calgaryexpo getting excited!
Less than 2 hours until Canada gets #Outlander #OutlanderCAN
@BITTENKGW no one keeps the action coming like #Bitten and the season finales haven't allowed even time to breathe!
@RogersonSean thank you for letting us love to hate you so much. Look forward to seeing you on lots of new shows in the future #BittenS2
#BittenS2 #BittenFinale raked me over the coals and ripped my heart out. So, please #RenewBitten @bittentv
WTF was that ending??? #BittenS2 #bittenfinale #renewbitten
But I want everyone to be a happy family! No Nick/Paige goodbye that's just so, so wrong. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> they need each other! #BittenS2
The soundtrack of my sobs, squeals, shrieks, noes and yeses is alas not being recorded. #BittenS2
Ruth! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #BittenS2 I just can't even... But I understand why...
When you're crying too much to appreciate shirtless @greystonh #BittenS2
@SpaceChannel @Vandiekins22 @greystonh I can't breathe very well right now! #BittenS2
Never take candy from strangers in case it turns into a mind controlling devil worm in your arm. Or something like that. #BittenS2
Kain! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #BittenS2
Most unexpected redemption of ever.
No no not prepared to sacrifice Savannah <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> never going to want Elena to have to go through that! #BittenS2
We're all sorry you survived Aleister. #BittenS2
Holy shit! @tommieamber @Vandiekins22 are amazing #BittenS2
Only the classiest guys call their mothers a whore #justsaying #BittenS2 #renewbitten
“@bittentv: @Darksting77 Not long to wait now! #BittenS2 starts next Friday April 17th on @SyfyTV” Americans watch!!!
But I want @bittentv and @OrphanBlack on the same Saturdays @SpaceChannel this one at a time sucks!
Ya know, Clara can drop dead any minute and I won't cry #BittenS2
Kain and Clay fighting side by side wasn't in any of the predictions! #BittenS2
Sorry @RogersonSean we love you but we want Aleister to die now and never come back. #BittenS2
I like Clay's problem solving style #BittenS2
We're all dead by dawn (please let that be a bad prophecy) #bittenS2 #BittenFinale #RenewBitten
Logan!!! <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> #BittenS2 #bittenfinale #renewbitten
Warning US #Bitten fans! 
Ok let's do this! #BittenS2 #bittenfinale #renewbitten
Torturing myself by re-watching #BittenS2 Ep 9 before the #bittenfinale and crying a lot. Tear ducts warming up for what's coming.
@Belen_Ariana there's only 10 Bitten episodes a season. You can watch Season 1 before Friday.
@ABOotlanders since I'm in the Calgary ward with a school trustee by-election Monday it really looks like someone vomited all over the grass
I really hate that the US gets Outlander the same time Canada gets Bitten cuz I need to tweet with my pack but want no spoilers from my clan
@birdkittyme *cough* @Belen_Ariana @SageHillfarms
Dear Americans, #Bitten season 1 is on your Netflix and #BittenS2 starts next week on SyFy. Watch it! It's one of the best shows ever made!
Less than 90 minutes until #BittenS2 but I'm not ready for it to be the #bittenfinale so they have to #renewbitten or I'll die!
@wilzmak there's a reason bank is a 4 letter word.
@ABOotlanders the wind today was nice enough to blow over all the stupid posters for the AB election. I haven't seen TV ads yet.
@ABOotlanders me too. I consider it an excellent measure of a high quality mind.
@ABOotlanders @CatsandKilts why #ideserveajamiespankin could be a whole glorious trend of the fandom if it hasn't been already without me
@Calgaryexpo that means there might be another one because if it was no you could say!
@Calgaryexpo is this the last announcement for sure or are there possibilities of another?
@Belen_Ariana by the time you're through Jaynestown and the never aired Heart of Gold, you'll hate Fox.
@Belen_Ariana took you long enough!
@RoryGraveland it's hard to strategically place a vote when you want to say none of the choices are acceptable. That's when turnout drops.
@Calgaryexpo is the schedule up now final except for last minute changes - as in it includes all the panels expected to occur?
@OutlanderArts that it can be!
8 sleeps to @JewelStaite at #CalgaryExpo
(When does it become "I can't sleep, I'm too excited?")
@ChattanGypsy I got that you were agreeing, sorry, was reiterating my paranoid cynicism.

<WHITE MEDIUM STAR><WHITE MEDIUM STAR>Of course you are!<WHITE MEDIUM STAR><WHITE MEDIUM STAR>

Tweet often. Help trend #Outlander
Spread the word... 
It won't dare snow on Saturday at this year's @Calgaryexpo bc Agent May can melt snow with her glare alone! @MingNa
@ChattanGypsy if you're pretending to be perfect, you're hiding the part of you that's not - at least to me.
Is it wrong that I think a perfect 100% politically correct orchestrated blog with a domain is trying too hard? It's a trustee by-election.
I have 2 elections to vote in within the next month. I must vote to preserve my right to bitch about stuff. Even school board trustees.
@josswhedon and it's non-existent bc censorship?
@nenshi @RoryGraveland if there was a referendum on whether we approve of the latest budget, it'd increase voter turnout.
Me: #Outlander blah blah blah Outlander blah Outlander
Dad: you know your ancestors were the Sassenachs?
Me: duh!
Am I the only Shadowhunter who thinks Molly Quinn is way too tall for Clary? #unpopularopinion
@Belen_Ariana I saw it back then bc it was cheaper to go sober up during a movie than take a cab home and come back to get my car <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
Some movies are improved by being viewed after a shooter party with co-workers. This is definitely one.
Watching Cowboys and Aliens. You know, when I saw it in theatre I thought it was good. It appears that's because I was drunk.
@jaugustrichards so very happy to see you on my screen again!
Fits you bloody genius! #AgentsofSHIELD
All the good and the bad feels tonight! #AgentsofSHIELD
Making sure to schedule a photo op to give @grahammctavish big consensual hugs into my @Calgaryexpo schedule.
@clarkgregg I am deliriously excited about #NoSpoilers on this episode
Yesssssss!!! #AgentsofSHIELD can't say why bc spoiler
Squeeeeee!!!
@clarysparabatai I guess they have to end the show with everyone getting a form of happily ever after. Klaroline is just perfect to me.
@clarysparabatai Steroline you mean? I think it's an abomination.
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms they never teach the interesting stuff in school.
@clarysparabatai trying to figure out what it can be without Elena or Jeremy. Just leaves us with Steroline and a pile of loose ends.
@SageHillfarms your sister in law?
@SageHillfarms I know wild boars ejaculate a gallon and cat penises are barbed...
@SageHillfarms so they're otherwise like bunnies who ovulate during mating and never otherwise, they just also need his noise?
She was sick of bullshit #MyTombstoneIn5Words
@SageHillfarms that sounds like it shouldn't even be legal! Roflmao
@edsheeran the heat makes higher paraffin content in Aussie chocolate. Cold climates gotta have some perks. Calgary has amazing chocolate!
@SageHillfarms i think without experience or instructions, people might be as clueless.
Also, there's alpaca porn on YouTube? Lol
@SageHillfarms home sweet home. At least your scheduled adventures are over for now.
@maureenjohnson confiscates scissors
@SageHillfarms he really needs to not be anywhere alone until this gets investigated <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@AnthonyMaglio @_flanders @Outlander_Starz hopefully that's just bc it was a holiday weekend
@Calgaryexpo how long for a complete schedule? It looks like most of the media guests are on the one out but no Hayley Atwell yet.
Maybe I shouldn't have drank the whole bottle of champagne, but I wouldn't have wanted it to be wasted. #oops
@purpleiris13 Cait is the secret stunt stone skipper #makestuffup
@Raynor1917 @showcasedotca I think it was sometime in the middle. @ABOotlanders caught it.
@Raynor1917 we'll have to try again and again!
Dear family:
Roses are red
Violets are blue
I'd rather watch #Outlander 
Than spend time with you
#sorrynotsorry 
#justnotsorryactually
I don't know how Americans will handle #BittenS2 and #Outlander in the same night. All the sexy and the man buns and all the feels.
I missed the secret word. Damnit Showcase I guess I have to watch #Outlander #TheReckoning again.
A showcase fusion including#Defiance and #Outlander is really fucking confusing!
@ABOotlanders @showcasedotca we all sign up for spankings from Jamie Fraser I think?
Omg that can't be it??? More damnit! #OutlanderCAN #OutlanderReturns #cryingnow
Kilts should make a comeback bc easy access #OutlanderCAN #OutlanderReturns
Down with commercials! #OutlanderCAN (especially Katy Perry mascara ones)
Squeeeee! I was waiting for this moment #OutlanderCAN
Love having an episode from Jamie's perspective. Those who don't like it can just stick to the books. #OutlanderCAN
Only JAMMF would tolerate being kicked out of bed. #OutlanderCAN #OutlanderReturns #cockblocked <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @ABOotlanders
@3beachy best drinking game ever. The challenge is staying coherent enough till the end.
@cassieclare it's not too early to believe Stefan and Caroline would be all wrong!
#OutlanderReturns #OutlanderCAN drinking game: drink whenever you want to steal Jamie from Claire. Oops, drunk already.
I'm just getting ready for the part where they're in France, really. #OutlanderCAN 
Drinking champagne from a margarita glass on a #firefly coaster during #OutlanderCAN just shows how open minded and multi-fandom I am, right
Men don't come in a better overall package than James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser #OutlanderCAN #givemeJamie
Relationship status: waiting for Jamie Fraser
Intense! How can anyone be tweeting when it's not a commercial? #OutlanderCAN
@ABOotlanders because Star Trek credits = yawn?
Since I don't drink scotch I'm celebrating #OutlanderCAN with a good bottle of champagne. It's even the fancy kind.
5 minutes to go! #Outlander #OutlanderCAN
Looking at resumes to figure out who'd actually be good for a position is bloody hard. I don't envy people who do it regularly.
All the feels that really, really hurt! #BittenS2 
The U.S. #WOLFPACK has no idea what's coming for them!
And it's time for Canadians to go offline for 25 hours since spoilers. #Outlander @Outlander_Starz @showcasedotca
Some day, you'll realize that by deciding I wasn't worth the effort to be around, you lost out on something amazing in your life.
I hate pictures of me (and looking at me in general) but here's one anyways. In honour of Outlander. 
The first of 3 planned consecutive Fuck You Family nights is brought to you by... 
I think I'm finally committed to the belief that my family is simply just not worth the pain I experience in dealing with them.
@SageHillfarms 2 weeks 1 day to Calgary Expo and all the fun for me!
@Belen_Ariana I need to go back to Europe so I can find this mythical European man.
@Belen_Ariana lol they met working together in Afghanistan. They've lived together a few months a while back, in a week married life starts.
@Belen_Ariana I'm hoping for a happily ever after on this epic love story marriage. Now I need my own gorgeous European man.
Apparently if you come from Sweden and have a pile of military medals the Canadian government stamps immigration paperwork happily. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Had a nice family dinner to celebrate my brother-in-law's first day as a Canadian resident. 
@drsmit6 @stenbergmika @Outlander_Starz wait out in the cold for crap seats and free snacks? Total garbage!
I cannot believe it's a minimum 6 months to see a hematologist to figure out why my lymphocytes are rampaging. Damn Alberta Health!
One of these days I'm going to have cool pics to tweet of me having fun and it'll be @SageHillfarms at home #SoJealous
@Belen_Ariana yep that hair is nice just like there.
@SageHillfarms very purple!
I want an epic story of finding love in a most unexpected way across three (or more) continents like my sister has had. I'm happy for her.
We have balloons ready for my brother-in-law's official immigration to Canada today. So happy they've let him in! 
“@edsheeran: Me and the Sesame Street dudes - 
This is so damn cute!
Oh look! My Wembley can be more sleepy and adorkable.
(Now the kid is a teen furbaby is where it's at) 
This previously mythical thing where walking the dog resulted in meeting someone actually can happen, just took 2 years!
Took the dog on a walk and he made a new friend to run around with so now he's chilling on a pillow all worn out 
@chaptersindigo I think the price point will keep it from becoming mainstream.
@tmiobsessed unknowns make the best cast for overzealous fandoms
I seem to have more or less tracked my budget for a month. 1 down, infinity to go. Thank goodness there's a decent app for that!
@tmiobsessed it's impossible to ever choose the right actors for anything. People will always be unhappy.
@SageHillfarms remember, if Sam's wearing a kilt, you know what's under it - or rather not under it. Have fun!
I hate the day when no one can be trusted aka April Fools Day

*locks self in kitchen cabinet*
@tmiobsessed they'd have to commit to a movie per book or TV season per book. The change in character focus might be too confusing.
@chenoite it's on the periscope app which I know nothing about, I think it may be viewable for 24 hours but I've no real clue.
Ack! My medical appointment gets in the way of watching the #TartanAffair tomorrow. I hope someone is going to find a way to record it.
@A_SunnySpot I was only saved by the part where the title seemed to make no sense and I've got 2 decades on you.
When it gets windy enough to blow books off my shelf on the 3rd floor, I keep wondering how bad it is on the 18th!
@pammy_jo1963 @meaversch @purpleiris13 @ChattanGypsy sounds familiar but almost biblical as well
@meaversch @purpleiris13 @pammy_jo1963 @ChattanGypsy there's many things in the world that need help we've got to focus on what's possible
So, there's exciting things April - August and then going back to school.
It is the last day of no exciting things month. 2 exciting events in April, 1 in June, 1 in August. May has Age of Ultron, July has movies.
@KristinDSantos @Outlander_Starz @SamHeughan fundraising idea for @beatbloodcancer - auction scotch tasting with Sam event tickets
@pammy_jo1963 @purpleiris13 @meaversch @ChattanGypsy is anyone suggesting there's better uses of our time than discussing Sam? <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@cassieclare @ArthurBooBoo Hazel eyes are as close to gold as we can get without contacts or CGI. Lots of Hazel eyed blonds around!
@pammy_jo1963 I don't think Aidan has any social media presence, but he's one of my faves too.
@drsmit6 every mother needs a break
I think @StuartCamp puts up with a lot of shit and never gets any credit (but I could be wrong).
@pammy_jo1963 @ScotlandNow this is the hardest poll I've seen in a long time.
Disgusted by the complaints I saw directed at @Calgaryexpo on facebook. Guests or their agents set costs and terms not Expo people.
@stanascollins I'm waiting for things to be announced bc I can't handle any more rumours.
@stanascollins no one can replace any of them. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@ShadowhuntersTV Alec is my fave!
@tmiobsessed (cuz I was all well that's like Quinn then omg those should be movies!)
@tmiobsessed not the brand new one, but the rest I have. Started thinking about them on the screen bc of TSwift using the actor w/ diff eyes
@tmiobsessed this is tops of on my "put it on a screen now" series list
@blakcirclegirl it's a question of how long I'm in limbo on this waiting to get a diagnosis for my body's latest incompetence and what it is
@blakcirclegirl I'll need to replace the computer for school in the fall. Unless of course I'm too sick for school which I'm scared of.
@blakcirclegirl it doesn't help that I spent money and made plans before the budget got tight.
@blakcirclegirl I know money will be tight until I finish school, about 3 years away. I'm doing my best to scrape through til then.
@blakcirclegirl I suck at saving money, so I can't say a lot, other than trying to prioritize.
@blakcirclegirl crafts cost $ and she can't keep up with it all. If she stuck with the running that'd make sense. Needs time for the kids.
@blakcirclegirl it could be painting pottery or something more expensive. At least sports are good for your body?
@blakcirclegirl uhhh what expensive hobby? Enquiring minds must know!
@leven_stund shush. That's because we as Canadians have disowned him.
@Much @edsheeran Woohoo! Canada needs more Ed. (So excited for the part where I get to see him live just before this!)
@ShadowhuntersTV @ABCFamily waiting to hear if it's going to be aired outside the U.S. To get excited.
@dessywinsy I'm waiting for his latest movies to show up on video on demand here in Canada. I think the U.S. &amp; UK have at least one.
@dessywinsy he is succeeding. He's chosen to act in indie movies that aren't obsessed with big $. Fulfillment over money.
Dear @ShadowhuntersTV please cast unknown actors so that fans don't have preconceived notions about them, avoid the hate factor.
@dessywinsy Robbie has said he wants movies only bc TV gets boring. It's why he quit Misfits.
@A_SunnySpot step 1: get famous, step 2: try and use your fame to get your way?
@dessywinsy ha ha they will be getting all of our opinions whether they want them or not.
@cityofdevices that's where I'm at. Instead of actors we judge on previous parts played, actors who will be new and fresh to us.
@cityofdevices me too, but I think it's going to be low budget casting. Which means it could be someone's big break.
@ShadowhuntersTV I want a Simon with a NY accent!
@JewelStaite good news: food gifts for media guests are against Calgary Expo rules. (And I thought every con but I guess I'm wrong)
@TMIToronto I'm scared to fancast and get my hopes crushed - if they're filming in May not a long lead time to find cast. #ShadowhuntersTV
This part where they're asking who we want cast in #ShadowhuntersTV so they can then ignore it sucks. Our actors are busy. New cast pains.
@clarysparabatai tried to find it but can't. It explains why he's always in all these indie projects, though.
@clarysparabatai + and he doesn't want to do another project where nothing matters but one number. <PENSIVE FACE>
@clarysparabatai he was very unhappy that they worked so hard on the movie and all the studio cared about was opening box office dollars +
@clarysparabatai did you see Robbie's recent interview about how he felt about the way things turned out with the movie?
It's a measure of how wrong the TMI rumours were that they didn't even get the right city for filming. Hope they reuse the Institute set.
@2458GP when the movie came out she tweeted that Alex Pettyfer would always be her Jace. Some things are not forgivable and that's one!
@2458GP I'm with you,but tacked on is no Molly Quinn cuz she thought Jamie was a terrible Jace so keep her away from my stuff!
After falling for a bunch of BS rumours, the TMI fandom is leaping to fall for new rumours. Learning curve please?!?
If I look for potential causes of 'absolute lymphocytosis' on the internet anymore I think I'll go crazy. Nothing good there.
@RoxieTech my teen keeps falling for love tweets and sexual orientation come-outs from celebrities so it's very abused IMO.
@ABOotlanders so glad you exist, yay!
@RoxieTech i knew it! I haven't found it but was sure it existed.
@whedonesque @josswhedon the celebrity fake tweet generator has been a thing for so long with the "but then he deleted it" claim. Boo.
@dillon_leah thanks!
The ET Canada 'interview' with Sam Heughan was the most underwhelming thing. Only Q about adjusting to fame and if more steamy scenes coming
@JessDayGeorge I'm so glad I stumbled upon your book! I love fairy tales switched around

Of all the library ebooks I've tried randomly later, this one is the best, but then I'm a fan of fairytale reboots 
Glad this day is over. Tomorrow, please be better.
The book I just finished had a scene that felt like it was plagiarism of the "I know what you are" scene from twilight. It was weird.
@TMIScotland TMI TV plot twist: none of the stories are true (see what I did there lol except aging up is true but the movie did that)
Vance Joy's Georgia video confuses me, but I think I understand the important part which is the macho militia guys passionately kissing
Where in my body could I have an acute infection that it wouldn't show up in a physical and I wouldn't notice it? I'm perturbed.
“@eonline: Attention, ladies: Ed Sheeran is officially a SINGLE LAD! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@grahammctavish will be waiting at @Calgaryexpo with a big hug (assuming you accept fan hugs)
@MundieMoms I'm trying to forget everything I've ever heard about the show now. They were aged up in the movie also, so that's not a biggie.
@cassieclare night Cassie! I hope you will be hearing and seeing more good things about the show.
@MundieMoms I'm angry because Cassie was so upset about stuff that was false. I just wish I knew who to direct that at.
@MundieMoms now I'm wondering how fake scripts and Craigslist ads for actors got floating around. Somewhere in the rumours was an intent.
I don't think any of the #Outlander fans taking the who you'd fall for quiz are getting anything but Jamie Fraser. All is well in the fandom
It's set in the Stones. Take the quiz and find out who you'd fall for before #OutlanderReturns April 4. 
@cassieclare so we've got nasty troll trouble and not so much pilot incompetence trouble. This is great news! Now to troll hunt!
@suchasassynach thanks
@suchasassynach waiting is going to stress me out. At least there's a few things that aren't problems or are fixed, though.
@suchasassynach thanks. I'm really hoping it's just a bad infection but no clue since I just had a physical what might've been missed.
@suchasassynach I'm honestly quite scared right now as alternatives other than undetected acute infection/inflammation are blood cancers
It's a pretty shitty day when the best case scenario after bloodwork is an undetected acute viral infection.
Hee hee @Outlander_Starz #Outlander 
Some things have to be done 
@BklineBetty I get most of the shows in PST so I'm always avoiding EST live tweets for my shows. This is no different. Still annoying though
@BklineBetty that one day after the U.S. gets it will be so hard!
@Calgaryexpo @SpaceChannel @AjayFry @morganhoffman @TeddyWilson knew it! (But yay, love them!)
@A_SunnySpot as if management is going to do more than issue an official statement and tell ticketmaster no refund on tickets already bought
@A_SunnySpot fandom drama to the max?
@bittentv I can't pick one werewolf, I love the whole pack #werewolfwednesday
5 of the 6 top trends in Canada are about Zayn. Woah.
@maureenjohnson when I got a CAT and EEG done, I remember being incredibly proud there was proof I had a brain.
@ter1220 yay for the sane response!
I don't want to wait until tomorrow for my medical test results. I want them now.
@ter1220 mine is upset, but says he never handled the lack of privacy well and now he can plan his wedding. I'm proud of that response.
@ter1220 it's spring break so mine is already freaking.
@Mynameis_Beckyy I'm old enough to remember all the fan suicides over Kurt Cobain's death. Only this isn't even a death. It's sick.
@Mynameis_Beckyy crazy obsessive fans are a symptom of a really big problem.
@dessywinsy I feel bad for the fans bc they lose out and every tour shirt that's been printed will have Zayn so it'll keep hurting.
@dessywinsy I think that refunds on the tour tickets should be offered but I know it won't happen. Glad I didn't buy my kid tickets.
It's always shit when someone leaves a band, but so much worse when it's mid tour.
Feeling bad for 1D fans especially those who bought tickets for the tour because they wanted to see Zayn Malik. Esp those with $800 VIP tix.
From the impression I'm getting, Prentice continues to be a moron who'd sound smarter with his mouth shut. Politics give me a sad.
@mikesbloggity so bloggers not paying taxes are the problem in the economy? #snark
@KhaleesiMiley @dessywinsy @cassieclare it's like kids in the car asking "are we there yet" it seems they think today she'll know.
@whedonesque @TheToast Buffy arguments need to be split into those had by sober people and those that weren't before cataloging further ;)
@suchasassynach yes it's a lot to try and take in.
@suchasassynach I strayed off the vanilla path in my reading a long time ago so that didn't bother me, but the actual torture scenes did.
@suchasassynach I only like reforming the promiscuous man stories if the guy isn't abusive to the woman from the start.
@suchasassynach I get into the book and then go "oh, this is why it was available now through the library's eBook system - it's crap" <PERSEVERING FACE>
@suchasassynach then she falls in love and "I'm sorry" makes the abuse/objectification ok. Kind of a scary trend to see.
@suchasassynach not a fan either. The ones I've read recently were a man seducing a woman begging him to stop then he falls in love, and
@suchasassynach i read romance, just needs a plot. I'm disturbed by the trend of non-consensual seduction in what I've read lately though.
@suchasassynach the new adult I'd tried were next to no plot and lots of sex scenes. It wasn't appealing. I read YA &amp; adult, mostly fantasy
@suchasassynach not sure what exactly it was called but someone had tried to mix a decade's worth of the bestselling Sci-Fi/fantasy in one
@suchasassynach post-apocalyptic world where humans had lost the war with vampires and it was like all the dystopian &amp; vampire in a blender
@suchasassynach and in the meantime I just want books that aren't terrible. I'm convinced I found the worst book of all time a while back.
Nothing is more annoying when I'm pissed off than having my mom comment about my facebook status on it. Considering unfriending all family.
@edsheeran draw cute pictures!
I hope you get better fast x
@suchasassynach (cont'd) they take a long time to get new books and then the demand gets super high before I realize they've gotten them!
@suchasassynach I do eBooks, I've got iBooks and kindle. I read a lot of things I'm just out of suggestions. The library has a ton, but +
@suchasassynach I'm the opposite I'm struggling to find books without a 6 month library wait list lately (budget means library books)
@Belen_Ariana haven't seen his hair back that tightly.
@Belen_Ariana I don't think it'd be on anyone
@maureenjohnson we all cooperated on a go fund me to hire them stolen.
@CatsandKilts my sister who at the age of 30 won't have a family birthday if I'm there bc of something over 13 years past. Hurts a lot.
@Belen_Ariana yeah but worst hair ever. I'd be in pain with it pulled back that tight!
The suit was nice though <WINKING FACE>
@rparkinson86 Sam &amp; Cait aren't yet at that point but I've seen other casts where it happens with the millionth time a Q is asked.
@rparkinson86 press tours are where the cast gets asked the same Q's so many times that they sometimes snap and give ridiculous answers
Sometimes people are incredibly horrible for no good reason. And then you're left crying and feeling like you've been punched.
@DaveCote @Calgaryexpo high on my wish list too, but I think @OrphanBlack is still filming so they aren't free to leave Toronto. <PENSIVE FACE>
@Calgaryexpo I'd like to see @SpaceChannel bring some @bittentv cast to Expo.
Shows filming in April I get that they're busy like Defiance
@rparkinson86 lol even the moon gets fangirly and flushed for Outlander
@AgentKalGibbs you probably wouldn't have enjoyed the hug if you'd given up your soul <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@AgentKalGibbs yay!
I don't have any heroes anymore.
@AgentKalGibbs fingers crossed for you!
Got one of the best hugs ever from J. August Richards last September and a good convo.
@AgentKalGibbs yeah I regret freezing up &amp; being mute when he was here &amp; I did a photo op. Demand for him was insane so no talk time anyway.
@AgentKalGibbs next month's Calgary Expo is the last one I can go to before I go back to school and have no time and money.
@AgentKalGibbs seems like there's already a Whedon explosion announced for that con. Jealous!
@CatsandKilts just toss back a B Complex pill then lol. It's what gets depleted by the buzz.
@daeganf beware the secret covens of ants beneath the ground <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CatsandKilts just replace the B Vitamins and count the calories and it's nothing wrong <WINKING FACE>
Now that I have my Fitbit I have something that isn't capable of nagging me to see where I'm at and make progress.
@edsheeran this is so cute - it's like you're the spirit of happiness dragging him along until he gets into it.
@pammy_jo1963 @PeakChallengeCA @purpleiris13 it changes the shape of his face, too. When he took it out and had a headache hope he knew why!
Finally trusting iOS 8 is stable enough for my phone. I hope it's been debugged enough.
@sarahreesbrenna no point fainting unless there's some way for you to get something awesome out of it. Which is very rare!
So many actors I love were at Toronto ComiCon, but that's half bc the shows are filming in Toronto right now. I get that.
@cassieclare hoping for the best and you go with all of us fans as ammunition. We've got your back <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@pammy_jo1963 @PeakChallengeCA @purpleiris13 #FreeSamsHair and fire whatever stylist pulls anyone's hair that tight!
@pammy_jo1963 @PeakChallengeCA @purpleiris13 glad to know I was the only one looking at today's pics and thinking boo on the bald look
@Belen_Ariana goes to DM bc spoilers
@Belen_Ariana I guess they'll complicate up the situation in part 1 then actual Allegiant will be the 4th?
@Belen_Ariana they're planning on splitting the next one into 2, but the situation in the movie was so dumbed down I don't get that.
@Belen_Ariana I guess it was ok as a movie but it didn't even leave things in the right situation for the next one. Worse than CoB by far!
@sarahreesbrenna be grateful if you're reincarnated your children will never know it was the secret message behind that movie I think.
@suchasassynach the fire ones seem to be dragons lol
For the record, it seems half the YA fantasy section have titles starting with 'blood' or 'fire' <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Out of books that aren't on long hold lists from the library, so I downloaded ebooks I've never heard of whose plot summary seemed ok.
Loving @sarahreesbrenna's summary of Jupiter Ascending except it's lacking in lizard dragon creature CGI appreciation.
The funniest thing about Insurgent was that the ridiculous joke I made about the purpose and way to open that box was actually right. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
OMG. I have never seen a looser concept of "adaptation" or a movie less faithful to the book than Insurgent. Worse than I'd even imagined.
Seeing Insurgent in 5 and hoping it does justice as an adaptation.
@A_SunnySpot let me know if you figure that one out
@BITTENKGW oh nos! I can't live tweet cuz I'm parenting and she's a bit young for Bitten <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> I feel deprived already.
@cityofdevices I'm 99% sure it is
@SamHeughan we kinda think you're worth the effort <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@suchasassynach now it's time to charge all our phones probably lol
@stenbergmika @SamHeughan and heir to Twitter <WINKING FACE>
@purpleiris13 @stenbergmika we gave Sam over 2 million votes!
@purpleiris13 @ChattanGypsy there will be 2 more rounds for winners of this one and we can go back to focusing on our fitness goals.
For those implying that this isn't about Sam, that it was proving our fandom I think that's not the right attitude. It was Sam appreciation.
@suchasassynach also, lots of us were using up valuable not unlimited phone data
@suchasassynach @stenbergmika @giddy_up_7 I've seen implications that are getting ugly which has me disappointed in others.
@stenbergmika once Outlander has aired in more markets we'll have a much wider fan base for this kind of thing.
We're doing everything we can and still slipping further and further. Crappy feeling. #OutlanderClan
@7_polk @heartoutlander @marilyn_geary @b304SMN suddenly it's gotten much easier to get kicked out, just as I saw it go up once.
@SageHillfarms ugh. Not a good start to the weekend.
@suchasassynach I've figured out the exact rhythm for my phone. 90 mins to go!
@MimiCipher @suchasassynach not just 20,000 but 20,000 more than the opposition votes in the same time frame <PERSEVERING FACE>
Where are all the east coast #Heughligans? It's after 8 am! #Outlander
@SilverxVideos it's the time I should've been sleeping I've given up. Will pay for it later.
@SilverxVideos I've been voting hundreds of votes per hours for the last 10 hours so I'm definitely not giving up!
@SilverxVideos time zones seem to be against us. However, Prince of Twitter is not bad either.
@jjmac286 @heartoutlander 49.04 <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@Macca1Sheryl so many things getting put on hold be it sleep or otherwise for this
@Macca1Sheryl it's about 4 am here. And nearly 5 more hours til it's over.
5 more hours to get back in the lead on this, cmon Fraser clan! #OutlanderClan #Outlander
@suchasassynach there's time for sleep tomorrow!
@Macca1Sheryl @Equilibria she's off to rest. We have to hope east coast is getting up soon!
@Equilibria whatever happens I'm sure we've set a hell of a record. Sleep well!

@sad2quilts @Writer_DG @stenbergmika @ChattanGypsy @heartoutlander @SamHeughan @Bouton_Barks dropping fast! Wakey wakey EST fans!
@Equilibria @WolfeTales @ChattanGypsy and the fandom is bonding which is also to our benefit
@Equilibria @WolfeTales @ChattanGypsy good! No matter what, we've made a strong impact, I think.
@WolfeTales @ChattanGypsy @Equilibria ugh. I know Sam would be disappointed if we got nasty over this.
@suchasassynach @WolfeTales @ChattanGypsy @Equilibria the only one who's freaked out on me is my own offspring when she saw <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@WolfeTales @ChattanGypsy @Equilibria are you running into people acting rude over this? I'm not posting who we're against to avoid that
@WolfeTales @ChattanGypsy @Equilibria nap time in the padded room once this ends?

@purpleiris13 @Debra_McGill @RadMama88 @ChattanGypsy @IrisD236 @Equilibria @weeknightingale @suchasassynach not nearly enough of us on <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@ChattanGypsy we can fight back!
@demijolras to each their own, I guess. I can't understand lots of what people watch but it's often things that are highly rated.
@demijolras I only watched it a couple times, but there are people who just love it.
@demijolras and swears and insults them, yep.
Kitchen Nightmares is the one with the disgusting food that he vomits  back up.
Watching The Gathering episode of #Outlander and wondering how many babies born 9 months after the Gathering? @Writer_DG
@demijolras pretty much what I do. The one I can watch without getting hungry is Hell's Kitchen
@demijolras Best Eats is the absolute worst for that.
BTW to anyone reading this who I don't follow back, just let me know what we have in common and I will - can't without knowing.
@demijolras I hate one of the judges on the Canadian one. The U.S. One isn't bad but I've stopped watching food TV bc it makes me hungry lol
@demijolras seen US &amp; Canada
@Equilibria @purpleiris13 @ChattanGypsy just saw it drop! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@IrisD236 @ChattanGypsy @purpleiris13 @Equilibria @weeknightingale @suchasassynach 25 seems to be the cut-off a lot of people have found.
@ChattanGypsy @purpleiris13 @IrisD236 @Equilibria @weeknightingale @suchasassynach if I stick to 20 then 1 min+ pause I never get blocked
@IrisD236 @Equilibria urgh why can't they be sleeping in? <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@chenoite these companies hide. Not even the JC staff could tell me who'd bought them. I think they and Nutrisystem are under huge companies



@chenoite until a couple years ago Nestle owned Jenny Craig. Ads it's funny but companies making profit both ends isn't.
I have energy drinks and alcohol so I am ready to vote all night! @ChattanGypsy #OutlanderMarathonVoteParty
View on my phone is mighty fine #Outlander 
@7_polk I think she promised to not get annoyed by video games in return lol
@7_polk @Equilibria @ValiaFebruary @ChattanGypsy one of my fangirl friends husband included not getting jealous of fictional ppl in his vows
@Equilibria @ChattanGypsy @ValiaFebruary Sam is a much better role model so I'm totally justified <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>
@ChattanGypsy @Equilibria @ValiaFebruary I'm voting during family movie night on my phone. My teen would kill me 4 trying 2 beat Misha lol
So, I tried to take a short nap and slept 6 hours. Oops.
@Lovewords22 shampoo/conditioner with coconut milk is the yummiest. It leaves my hair smelling so good!
@square_petals @purpleiris13 @somooie @Equilibria @Dmpozz @ChattanGypsy @stenbergmika yes! That's time for a 2 minute break
@stenbergmika so one in a few hundred thousand people will get $30 and this motivates people to vote? Ugh!
My hair smells like coconut and my feet like mojitos. If I don't look out the window I can pretend I'm on a tropical vacation.
@SageHillfarms please send snow this way. We'll have a drought this summer due to lack of snow at this point.
@Geillis68 @SamHeughan @stenbergmika Sam has ~100K followers, opposition has over 1.5 million followers
I'm getting a heck of a bruise from where they drew blood this morning. Boo!
@ChattanGypsy we need an all nighter where we marathon Outlander and vote
@purpleiris13 we've lost another .02 since it reopened <UNAMUSED FACE>
@Equilibria @ChattanGypsy that extra hour in the morning will really help us I think.
Apparently they'll be extending the time tomorrow am for the Zap2it. This will work in our favour bc that's time we're up #Outlander
@ChattanGypsy @Equilibria @Zap2it ack now I'm getting a poll closed message???
@ChattanGypsy @Equilibria @Zap2it Safari on iOS is working
@Rosemontower couldn't even have gum or diet pop. I cheated by putting a lime wedge in my water though...
@Rosemontower I'm fasting for blood tests so I can't snack even! It's driving me nuts.
Time to try and fall back asleep. Stupid brain that thought 2:30 am was wakey time...
@SilverxVideos Blu-Ray format movie disks so I needed it to play anything.
@SilverxVideos I don't have anything to test it with right now actually but all the site reviews say it works. Microsoft doesn't support +
@SilverxVideos I had to replace my disk drive on my computer and was all excited that $20 software would make DVD&amp;Blu-Ray region free.
@SilverxVideos not sure if the region-free player or an external drive for your computer would cost more tbh.
@SilverxVideos uh oh. I guess all you can do for now is cuddle the box then <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@SilverxVideos if you have a computer that plays BluRay it just takes software to make it region free.
@JodyUSMC I guess Europe woke up. @SamHeughan we are trying our best for your Twitter crown! @purpleiris13 @stenbergmika
@jabonader @purpleiris13 @biloxichoctaw @SamHeughan I think right now is our strongest time of day/night
@purpleiris13 had a good one last year when I was in London. 2 shots espresso, sugar syrup and a shot of rum makes 8 am so much better lol
@Btlewisva @stenbergmika @purpleiris13 rumour is the opposition's secret weapon is a huge Russian fan base
@purpleiris13 we may need a group to pull an all-nighter tomorrow night. Espresso martini time perhaps!
@purpleiris13 that we do. Couldn't sleep last night and kept voting and watching it drop by about 0.01 per minute overnight.
@purpleiris13 @stenbergmika that moment we've been working for! 

@wearedeified CAD, so we're close to $2 per £1. If I find a "must have or else" I'll find a way to make it work, though.
@wearedeified I want but exchange rates are killing my budget lately!
@edsheeran studio part sounds more fun <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
We're getting pushback. 

Plz bring the heat! <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>vote!


@SageHillfarms is @SamHeughan hiding from Twitter?
@purpleiris13 @Equilibria @ChattanGypsy @CatsandKilts @stenbergmika yes, that we do. Would help if OL had aired in all time zones.
@Equilibria @ChattanGypsy @CatsandKilts @purpleiris13 @stenbergmika we might be needing to get up early or lose in the final hours <WEARY FACE>
@ChattanGypsy ahhh. Bummer. I can never get booted if I do 20 on my phone then on my iPad.
@ABbrowncoats @Calgaryexpo I am! I can't see the 'reusable crates do not destroy' on my tiny TV #Serenity
@ChattanGypsy don't forget you can vote on every device you can get your hands on <WINKING FACE>
#Outlander 
@edsheeran is this going to only be in the UK @StuartCamp? Link in Canada and Australia both not working.
@edsheeran in Canada that just links to the deluxe X. I guess we can't get the new song here <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Insomniac song lyric of the hour "They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ you @edsheeran
@EvaSzilagyi77 ack! And switching to Europe time seems to not be helping. I should be sleeping...
@ChattanGypsy borrowed another device and the critical number to not hit this round seems to be 25 votes... I'm still going but slipping <PERSEVERING FACE>
So excited for @Calgaryexpo as I've let my 13 year old watch Firefly and she's in love with Kaylee. @JewelStaite is her fave actress now! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@__Andi__ @SageHillfarms @Peak_Warriors @MyPeakChallenge even if someone feels he or she is at peak, maintaining it is a challenge.
@ChattanGypsy not been much competition rounds 1-3 for him. His show's had 10 seasons to get fans. Ours has had 1/2.
@SamHeughan @MyPeakChallenge @lamarathon @F1ghtCamp @BearStrength @beatbloodcancer thank you for giving us such strong motivation to improve
@ChattanGypsy this is the battle against last year's title taker but Sam had more votes last round. We just have to be relentless!
@Lovewords22 and Jamie is all sleeping missing out on the chocolate thoughts. Poor boy. @blakcirclegirl @Jamiebower
@Lovewords22 if @Jamiebower wants to live in a world without intact marshmallows in frozen chocolate things, I'm not going there <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Lovewords22 @Jamiebower I've had frozen hot chocolate gelato, it was delicious. The mini marshmallows that didn't harden in it were fab!
@SageHillfarms can't stop stupid people from being stupid.
@SageHillfarms @Writer_DG same as she said - it takes a lot and it's so frustrating that this is getting twisted.
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms @purpleiris13 could be more than 5, I'm just guessing on the top number I've seen to interact with one guest.
@drsmit6 not other than the part where they routinely have people apply to fill the audience weeks to months in advance
@drsmit6 lol. Never underestimate fandoms of any age or nature.
@drsmit6 clearly they wanted 5 people and didn't do their research. Idiots. And disappointed my friends.
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms they're not all bad, it's just some of them are IMO either fear mongering or ill advised suggestions.
Ooh @JewelStaite will be at @Calgaryexpo on the Thursday, which gives me a day of Expo all about her! #AllThePressure
@SageHillfarms @drsmit6 his ideas are outlandish (and I don't mean Outlandish). My mum watches the show.
@SageHillfarms @drsmit6 Dr Oz is scary crazy. This is my concern for you lot.
@drsmit6 @SageHillfarms that reads like a perfume ad lol.
If Stephen King thinks Crimson Peak is terrifying, how am I going to survive it? I need the Tom Hiddleston fix!
@SageHillfarms there's a facebook discussion on if only other celebs would inspire their fans like Sam, so the exposure ties to that nicely.
@SageHillfarms probably just morning show stuff. It'd be great if they can get Outlanders with huge progress stories on there.
@SageHillfarms I'm guessing he's going to be talking about MPC on Dr Oz...
@SageHillfarms you're turning into a Sam junkie!
@maureenjohnson laughing is for other occasions. Fainting is the must-do of the blood taking world. Then they give you a bed.
I'm not Irish and I'm taking a mental health day, so I'm sticking with purple pajamas. And the world will keep turning.
@2458GP it was awesome but torturous, we have a year for that excerpt to be in a book in our hands <WEARY FACE> @cassieclare
@maureenjohnson so, that's the equivalent to a serviceable used car in blood tests, basically. My environmental toxin test is cheap now.
This round is going to be a bloody battle
@blakcirclegirl ooh exciting! Aside from that, the $60 to spend 3 hours instead of 12... 9 hours saved for less than $7/hr value 2 your life
@blakcirclegirl your time has a value!
@blakcirclegirl still lots of time, but much better.
@blakcirclegirl that's 12 hours of bus time if the busses run on time. Crazy!

Ok The Last Herondale is now on iBooks! Eeek! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> @cassieclare <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

Anyone adventurous enough to mix avocado with coconut ice cream? I'm not!
8 days to my baby sister's birthday and I already have gift and card. Huge improvement over realizing I'd missed it altogether last year.
Dear Vogue: having your index on page 92 with 91 pages of ads before it doesn't induce me to buy next month's magazine.
@Belen_Ariana some guys I like with beards. Him, Nope, his jawline is too good!
@Belen_Ariana lol I don't, but probably bc that beard looks like the one my dad had in the 80's.
@Belen_Ariana where's the chiseled jaw?
Some days, all you are is a dog headrest. 
Happy birthday @alan_tudyk. May you be on my screens much more in this next year!
@chenoite I'm not sure it's not that bad since my neighbours say the baseboard type hot water heating is falling off the wall in theirs.
@chenoite Nope. I just need to be ready for the whole thing to be prepared unsafe and know I've got a bed somewhere and can rent storage.
@chenoite unfortunately there's nothing cheaper or better maintained and this city has the lowest vacancy rates in the country.
@chenoite it's 18 floors built in the 60's so I've no clue how bad things got.
@chenoite my lease per the new management company (given to me 2 months after I'd signed for another year) says bc of age frequent repairs.
@chenoite it's an older building and the previous management company neglected it. I'm worried all the pipes are all corroded.
@chenoite it's an apartment and it's shut off with notice for emergency repair, but they've done so at least 5x in 2015 so far.
Spending another day not at home because home has no water. It's happening often enough I'm worried about the building.
@SageHillfarms post-convention the emotional drop is called "con drop" so maybe part of it is similar in nothing stimulating happy hormones
@SageHillfarms is it tired from having been around people or let down because the people and fun are over?
@SageHillfarms boo. I am also, but I'm pretty sure I know why for me.
@TallShipProds wow. How wrong &amp; rude!
@ncgodfrey way to make sure  @caitrionambalfe is not impressed with you. @simonkass @Outlander_Starz
@iKrystalWatkins we could have the makings of a great charitable event here. #HairOlympics @RogersonSean @morganhoffman @leven_stund
@RogersonSean @leven_stund new spinoff. Bitten: the hair war
@morganhoffman well, @leven_stund has great hair, but @RogersonSean has better hair.
All guys could learn from @RogersonSean's hair. Just saying. #afterbite
@RogersonSean @Vandiekins22 "this is a baseball bat" lolz #BittenS2
@drsmit6 I almost always remember that part!
@hankgreen not that I know of and anyone following you after the story was posted can't see it.
@drsmit6 our convention is a 100% dry family friendly affair and nowhere walkable selling drinks. Not sure if freezing or babbling is worse.
@drsmit6 I usually freeze up with celebs anyways, so odds are nothing like that will happen.
@sniskybobfry oh dear he's coming here next month. Now I'm plotting!  @drsmit6 @grahammctavish
@wilzmak better @Vandiekins22 than me! #BittenS2 (ick to the max)
Clay needs advice from Nick when it comes to managing women #BittenS2

@wilzmak I'm going to guess no babies either? #BittenS2
A rather bloody start #BittenS2 but not as bloody as it should've been
It's time! American Wolf Pack beware spoilers #BittenS2
It's really windy, sounds like a TV tornado in my apartment so I'm glad I'm not up higher. Cold front coming in.
@drsmit6 that's about how much motivation it'd take for my defective knees to run! @SamHeughan
@SageHillfarms home sweet home?
Municipal emergency repairs mean no water without a return ETA. Might as well get to bed as can't do much without water.
@drsmit6 writers are like the arteries pumping the flow to the actors IMO <WINKING FACE> @SamHeughan @OutlanderWriter
@ChattanGypsy good to know. Yuck. Time for bed and for Europe to start clicking!
@SageHillfarms meanie.
Waited 36 hours to respond to query on really annoying issue. I think I managed to be mature (unlike if I'd not waited).
@SageHillfarms and you get to see the Ep again on the 1st. Canada waits til the 5th. Waaah!
@SageHillfarms it looked insane!
@SageHillfarms did they say how many fans were in that room?
It's been a month since I sent a package to Venezuela. What a cruel world that it takes 2 months to get something there!
@purpleiris13 good to know. Thanks. Sure it cut me off before 20, though. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@purpleiris13 how long does their time-out last for?
@alan_tudyk @NathanFillion @PJhaarsma never forget how much more the fans want to see of you!
Still frustrated @Outlander_Starz airs April 4 for US but @showcasedotca is airing April 5 because spoilers!
Hope other people's live streams were much less glitchy than mine was. Missed half the #Outlander panel in "error-reload" state. Boo!
My life is so exciting #PaleyFest #Outlander

@pammy_jo1963 @purpleiris13 @_RobynHerron @stenbergmika @sniskybobfry I was wondering how I blinked and it went from ahead by .2 to behind!
@SageHillfarms doubt is part of being an artist. Am sure they're great.
@missferran I am now very broke. Had not been in 5 years. Fortunately the chip in my tooth isn't as serious as it might've been.
Today, I went to the dentist and then had a physical. Tomorrow, I go back to the dentist at 7:30 am. Best week ever.
@StuartCamp not sure how you manage to do the job you do. I think you're phenomenal for all you put up with. Hope you get some sleep soon x
@Calgaryexpo understood. We all have to prioritize which means gambling a bit. I know by waiting I take a risk.
Photo op schedule before panel schedule leaves me feeling unable to book photo ops @Calgaryexpo
@edsheeran congrats on being so famous on your own that people are scared of you x
Many "fans" don't comprehend the privilege of fan mail. 
@2458GP she had a good life, what she did was for love of family and she didn't try and reform a 'beast' there's no abuse in it!
@mikesbloggity look in the mirror it must be our fault that a creationist is education minister #snark
@2458GP the competence and sanity of the heroine in Mulan scares off the people who like their Disney girls flawed.
@edsheeran it's a great song and deserves that recognition. And I'm so excited I'll get to see you (and hear you of course) on tour! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Frustrated at the third failed appointment for someone to get me back my binders. I need the info and this is insane. Incredible disrespect.
Typo makes me look stupid. DHA supplements. DHEA supplements aren't clever. DHA makes up a lot of my brain. More fish oil, less brain error.
So thirsty! Taking my DHEA supplements seems to do this to me. I wonder if I'm the only one?

Banana didn't go well into the smoothie. Fortunately my awesome protein powder masks culinary sins well.
@NathanFillion counter this with my teen daughter going on and on the other day about how you never ever are anything less than gorgeous.

@cassieclare the explanation of why it's forbidden has to wait for March? <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@SamMaggs also, there's the must be seen movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.
@SamMaggs many fans consider X-2 to have been the most wrong thing ever, but then there's those who love it more than life.
@SamMaggs 7 is where I started, going in order isn't necessary and everyone has different faves. 7 is the start of decent graphics IMO.
My daughter is cooking and I smell burning. Should I be concerned?
@dessywinsy otherwise if the U.S. fans shred it apart, if it airs later then no one will watch it. Crucial for the UK and Australia to get.
@dessywinsy if we all watch it illegally it helps nothing. I'm hoping there's a plan to air it internationally without a lag.
@dessywinsy ABC Family can't even be gotten in Canada via cable.
@dessywinsy I'm not sure if it'll air outside the U.S. If the reports are right and it's ABC Family airing it. That's my issue right now.
@Belen_Ariana hmmm now I need one.
@dessywinsy someone outside the fandom was nice enough to inform me that Vancouver is subbed for NYC in major shows. So, a positive fact.
@yasizacrob the UK and Canada are on "maybe but probably many months delay" unless Constantin pitches to networks here...
@yasizacrob can you get ABC Family? No matter what plan on my cable, I can't here. Unsure if it'll be picked up locally.
@joedaquisto @FizzleCollins good to know. Previous NY scenes for the series we're hearing about where in Toronto.
Casting "submit all ethnicities" for Clary, Jace &amp; Simon is politically correct but it's also very open to change the books more. #TMITV
@cassieclare @marashawr if they're filming in May, Jamie has commitments through the summer so we know he's out.
@FizzleCollins the only good news is they've dropped the producers of the movie who they said they were going to keep.
@FizzleCollins so it's being said with today's news. I'm hoping this is all going to be a big joke in the end.
@fangirlishness @TMI_Source whose fan fiction did they accidentally read instead of the books?
@TMI_Source crosses fingers hoping if it's ABC Family it's picked up outside of the US also.
@FizzleCollins I'm scared bc they can't possibly try to even make Vancouver look like NYC
How about if Prentice wants 2 blame Albertans for fiscal troubles he builds Calgary a new arena out of that corporate $ first @mikesbloggity
@X929 @nenshi regardless of if Shania was here before, we miss all the stadium only tours and many of the others due to set size/weight.
@maureenjohnson Wembley empathizes with the bored and snow challenges. He also recommends the squeakiest toys to help 
@TMI_Source Vancouver? <UNAMUSED FACE>
@maraamritadyers true enough. He sells out in 5 min worldwide to single seats only.
@maraamritadyers 200 level tickets fought for like crazy in presale, but yes
@maraamritadyers as it is, all floor seats were for the radio station to give away or their presale <POUTING FACE>
@maraamritadyers I found out he's coming here by accident. I don't listen to the right radio station to have gotten announcements.
@maraamritadyers probably the best way to go about it.
New US TMI CoB cover looks like a totally gender neutral cover. New UK CoG cover couldn't be girlier if it tried.
@FemaleFirst_UK @cassieclare @WalkerBooksUK these are pretty, but unlike the new US covers I don't think they'll attract male readers.
@maraamritadyers no one could be fine with that.
Total communication breakdowns cause a huge amount of stress. I'd really rather have someone professional enough to avoid them. Awake though
@mikesbloggity I looked in my mirror and saw a person who never voted for or ok'd Prentice. Her obscene gestures can't be tweeted.
@CharliScott where are you and what have I missed not being there?
This is the worst day I've had in months, but at least there's a new #AgeOfUltron trailer to help a teeny bit
I need to schedule my existential crises so that people are awake to talk to me about them.
If I don't believe someone has integrity, I can't work with that person anymore because the trust is gone. I think my mind is made up.
@SageHillfarms my brain doesn't wanna calm down. Silly brain.
@SageHillfarms you know who I mean, too. Why are you not asleep?
Nothing like locking the barn door after the angry cow has already stomped all over you.
@maureenjohnson hold out for the one you can get from Sweden where the kittens have laser beams shooting from their eyes. My sister has it.

@wearedeified hey now, no taking credit for the lad showing impressionable teen fans how to do partying hard right <WINKING FACE>
@A_SunnySpot I keep flipping what I see each time, depending I think on whose screenshot it is so I give up.
Alcohol also solves the problem of worrying over some dress. #IssuesSolved
@A_SunnySpot 
The dress is a more interesting attempt to break the Internet than Kim's ass. #justsaying
I have no permanent solution to my problems, but white wine spritzers make temporary solutions to most things.
Hope Ed Sheeran knows a stellar hangover remedy after what I've seen of after party pics from yesterday.
@maureenjohnson @haleshannon this makes puppies and kittens cry
@SageHillfarms @4EverJamieBower with @Jamiebower involved we'll all be kids again. Juice and cookies!
@blakcirclegirl not with girls trying to comfort him I don't think?
@Calgaryexpo yay! I love @jasonpal_art and it's amazingly affordable too!
@blakcirclegirl those are the pictures we haven't seen.
@blakcirclegirl aka single and drunk?

@SageHillfarms is it a go then?
@SageHillfarms Expedia was where I found the cheapest to LA a when I was looking a year back
@SamMaggs #coolinmyworld
More important than music awards, my brother in law got the monthly technical achievement award from his employer today!
@edsheeran <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> so true! You may underestimate your amazing talent but on point that he's going to be a legend too.
I'm sorry Madonna fell, but sorrier that it'll overshadow everything else at the Brits.
I like who won at the Brits much better than the Grammys. Time to move!
@Mynameis_Beckyy he said he'd start drinking as soon as he was done performing. Clearly, he's good at it.
Yay!!!!! @edsheeran so fricking happy!
WTF is Kim K doing to deserve presenting at the Brits?
Every time @edsheeran smiles I think a star shines brighter.
#EDSHEERANBRIT hands down
@SageHillfarms I'm too cheap to not do them myself
@SageHillfarms I wanna win! Wait.. Different lotteries. Can we both win please?
@edsheeran looks like you're taking over the world at this rate. I'm so glad you're out there making your music. x
@SageHillfarms mmm healthy fats
I'm craving avocado (and no I'm not pregnant). This is my weirdest craving in a long time.
@Lovewords22 it worked a little too well, but I'm very happy it seems it works!
Please work pretty bottle of all the sleep stuff 
It's been above freezing long enough it's mud outside. had to chase the dog through the house to catch him and get mud soaked paws to tub
@SageHillfarms I like huggy friends more than huggy family myself.
@SageHillfarms maybe the friends you're meeting this weekend will be the hugging type.
@SamMaggs I know they're not quite out yet officially for Calgary but I'm hoping magic can be worked. <WINKING FACE>
@SamMaggs are you going to have any of your books for sale at Calgary Expo?
@SageHillfarms yay!!!
@taylorswift13 @jackantonoff tied for my fave song off the album! Glad the whole world can love it with me!
@edsheeran have loads of fun, hoping @BBCR1 puts lots online for us (temporarily) Ed deprived North Americans. x
This will be the best Easter ever as we'll be celebrating my brother in law's immigration to Canada. I'm so happy it went smoothly!
Tomorrow is what should be the last IV and hopefully they've done their job. Alas it'll be at least a couple months to really know.
@YugenBliss <PARTY POPPER> I'm so glad!
All my packages got where they were going except poor @yasizacrob whose box has another 6 weeks by boat. Hope it's early!
@YugenBliss yay! Glad this time it got there safely
@SageHillfarms @blakcirclegirl <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@SageHillfarms I was saddened when Robin Williams' autopsy confirmed he'd not relapsed to drugs or alcohol and the media ignored.
@SageHillfarms apparently there was feminist talk and I guess that still gets all the attention?
@chenoite it's 3 years before I can take him. If he goes, it'll be to someone who trains agility dogs bc he's got such potential.
@chenoite yes we're pissed about it and need to find a better one. Forwarded that article, thanks.
@chenoite the problems started with a change to the dog daycare where they crate a lot more and exercise much less.
@chenoite I don't live with him anymore and all the doors to the room are closed, sound just carries in the house.
@maureenjohnson all the stuffs!
@chenoite when he's awake he throws a fit and he's waking up at 3:30 am lately many nights.
@chenoite he's precious. Alas, his distaste for crating means he's probably going to be rehomed. <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Birthday boy with his new bacon flavoured bone shaped plastic chew 
It's puppy's second birthday, but he's still such a puppy, not a grown up dog in spirit at all.
@SageHillfarms Outlander might overheat you <WINKING FACE>
@SageHillfarms very nice!
Next step: avoid Ticketmaster completely to avoid checking "just in case" if I'd kept trying I might've gotten better.
Calgary presale demand for @edsheeran is insane. Grateful to have gotten any seats at all. Very unusual for here, FYI. @StuartCamp
@SageHillfarms owch!
Less than 9 hours til presale and the Ed Sheeran tickets have gone up another $12 dollars on Ticketmaster, gone up over $20 since first up.
I'm gonna go back to bed before I go insane and do something stupid. One of those days.
My love for pizza and wings will be my undoing.
@SageHillfarms idk what's happening but if people are forgetting that, don't shut up.
@SageHillfarms sometimes things are too hard, too painful, to deal with easily &amp; despite your assessment you dealt with as well as could be
@A_SunnySpot thanks! With only $10 between floor seats and 300 levels it'll get fierce, but I'll be on when presale starts.
@A_SunnySpot good. Stressing over Monday's Ed Sheeran presale bc tix went so fast on last week's presale, but ready to fight in.
@A_SunnySpot yeah, so logging off was nice.
@A_SunnySpot and the last two are the ones full of drama?
@A_SunnySpot though when I go back to school in the fall i will be on here probably hardly at all.
@A_SunnySpot I have my books and TV shows here but the drama and negativity doesn't seem to build up the same way in those.
@A_SunnySpot there's a reason I keep my fandom accounts separate from my personal. Some days I just can't even deal with it.
@A_SunnySpot welcome back!
I need more #Outlander episodes. April 5th for us Canadians, huh @showcasedotca...
@morganhoffman lucky for you @TeddyWilson wasn't there to do his "I was right" dance about Malcolm. I bet he has one of those.
@Mynameis_Beckyy wow, long walk. Stay safe!
#BittenS2 prediction: Elena is the power needed for the key (Savannah) to open the gate for the Undoing. @BITTENKGW @bittentv @SpaceChannel
@Mynameis_Beckyy me too, only it's a 2 day drive away for me.
@BITTENKGW yes, sleep after #BittenS2 is harder than even season one
“@SpaceChannel: Agreed! #BittenS2 
Best last words over an evil dead body ever
I would like to know how @Vandiekins22 covered in blood could look so good. #BittenS2

Yay! #bittens2
Warning: live tweeting in 9 minutes
That 5 seconds of Roswell's Brendan Fehr in X-Men First Class <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Mynameis_Beckyy yah I didn't think so that's why I was confused.
@Mynameis_Beckyy sometimes awards have a viewers' choice thing. I guess it's the KCAs.
@Mynameis_Beckyy in Canada vote 5 SOS (with hashtag) and vote Fifth Harmony are in the top 3 trends.
So is it the Brit Awards that has top trends being 5 SOS vs Fifth Harmony? #clueless
“@greystonh: This is great. Just great. #OneLove 
Love it!
@Belen_Ariana I'm sure @MrRolandJohnson needs more Saturday sass!
@MrRolandJohnson where's your interesting snaps at? x <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
@daeganf agreed and Twitter helps us as viewers to bond with the writing staff in the adaptation which helps as well.
@daeganf it's important IMO if there's significant divergence someone's there metaphorically holding the series' fans hands through it.
Note to self: when doing a puzzle to relax, pick one that's not really, really hard.
I got Helena! Which "Orphan Black" Clone Should You Date? 
Umm not sure what to make of this one lol
My Twitter unfollowed people. Weird.
@TMI_TID_UK omg lucky girl! I bet he was a sweetheart
@maraamritadyers I love the book, but I needed the show to see what they meant with all the mom's crazy hysterical attacks
Ready to fight the ticketmaster online system Monday AM. Nervous since in Toronto presale tix went so fast.
@emisep32 ugh. Everyone but you knows best...
@maraamritadyers book is much better if you watch the A&amp;E 4 hour screen adaptation first
This stuff is delicious in case anyone in Canada is seeing my tweet. Best protein powder I've ever found! 
I still think the new Mortal Instruments covers are to try and attract guys to read them. Anyone agree with me?
@FizzleCollins this is most of us, I think.
“@JosephKahn: If we are having 50 SHADES sex in my red room and I am being too rough, the safe word is "lawsuit."” @Belen_Ariana <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Gee Lara, installing yahoo messenger aka the only SM with my exhusband on it was fucking brilliant. Really going shopping now.
Heading out into the snowy earlyness in search of a Nutri Bullet to replace my dead (8 year old) Magic Bullet.
I'm up bc my resource worker is supposed to be coming over, but I've got an email from her saying she's sick. Again. Frustrating.
@SageHillfarms the funny might do you good.
The more I think on it the more I think something monitoring my heart rate would track these panic attacks. Hopefully they'll let me sleep.
@SageHillfarms sleeping is much better than drugs.
@Belen_Ariana pizza would be good but not on the agenda any time soon!
This is said puzzle... 
Attempting to fix a crappy mood by losing myself in this puzzle. Worth trying a new approach!
@StuartCamp some positive feedback to balance the negative: I loved how the presale code came so nicely on signing up for Ed's newsletter.
@chaptersindigo I want one, still suffering sticker shock versus the previous models though. #IndigoTech
@sarahreesbrenna we must celebrate this with wild parties
I don't know if it's normal to just suddenly have as huge a slump in mood like I am today. Just end it all, ok?
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean you've not made someone decide they don't want to talk to you. <PENSIVE FACE>
Mini me is doing her LA project on Clockwork Angel so I can "help." So "we" will be working on Tessa's character traits shortly.
@SageHillfarms just remember if you want me, I'm around.
@SageHillfarms or just want to talk.
@SageHillfarms worried about you. If you need to talk, let me know. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Ok, so, there's one thing I want to help with the pain of loneliness I deal with right now and now I can't have that even. Grrr! <POUTING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@cassieclare that's kinda what I figured. it looks much more gender neutral than the other, so I hope it'll bring more male readers.
@cassieclare did you decide or your publisher? I'm curious as the article makes it look like you were all powerful in this.
@SageHillfarms hugs.
Tired all day bc I took a sleeping pill last night. Little teal pills, you're getting fired on Tuesday.
@Lovewords22 also, I think I'm done with mutual follows with people who follow 6000 people so don't see my stuff.
I need fewer "people I follow who've forgotten who I am" and more friends on here.
@Belen_Ariana spot on, except if the genders were reversed it'd be just as creepy.
@PoulterWill you learn whose brains are turned on by their responses and whether they have anything relevant to say.
@muse @NME clearly you're an inspiration to us!
@chaptersindigo I think it's a fabulous idea. I like to see any kind of artist going out of the box.
@chenoite total fluke in the daily challenge.
That score I'll never come close to again #BejewelledBlitz 
@chenoite no, it's not. Ive got friends who are working more than one job and have no time and don't initiate texts but they still reply
@chenoite every couple months I have to go back to that one.
@chenoite I guess we dedicate this to that person, too. 
@chenoite that sucks.
@chenoite I'm not sure whether that's a good thing I bolstered you or a shitty thing you're dealing with so I should be sad. Both?
@edsheeran @Gigwise you mean you're NOT a dragon Ed? *tosses presale code* <WINKING FACE>
Thought for the day/week/month/year 
I'd said I needed more to read this year and @SageHillfarms delivered by throwing me at @Writer_DG's #Outlander series #RealFriendship <WINKING FACE>
@chaptersindigo a TV series, myself. I like Bitten more on the screen than as a book.
@JosephMorgan tease!
When we booked our tickets, we did not realize we were going to see The Book of Mormon on Good Friday. Seems wrong somehow...
@Mynameis_Beckyy and you can keep it!
@Mynameis_Beckyy I'd rather do that than try and stick em into people.
@Mynameis_Beckyy my preliminary math test had stuff to be sure I'd understand dilutions for them.
I am out of hummus. This puts a cramp in my snacking plans.
@Mynameis_Beckyy we will be math geniuses on the stuff where what's in an IV bag is involved.
@Mynameis_Beckyy I need weeks more of exploring London.
@Mynameis_Beckyy they're going to make me take 3 hour math classes but I shall prevail!
@Mynameis_Beckyy once you get here given exchange rates it would be shockingly cheap, unlike London, but yeah. Getting here.
@Mynameis_Beckyy pharmacy tech where I use all the fancy machines to work magic in the hospital basement
@Mynameis_Beckyy you can always come visit me. People seem to like visiting here.
@Mynameis_Beckyy instead, our dollar here is too low to travel outside the country. Also, I'm going back to school in the fall so I'm broke.
@Mynameis_Beckyy story of my life x
@bittentv that's so hard! I think it'll be both back and forth
Yep once I found a resort where instead of in room liquor dispensers there was yoga, tai chi, other exercise classes and guided hikes. Sigh.
@Jamiebower sounds complicated. Better you than me. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@SageHillfarms and warmth and sun and being spoilt, but one of those much more $ resorts with health activities which I found once.
@SageHillfarms ugh. Not good either. We both need an all inclusive prepaid vacation in Mexico together to solve this. <WINKING FACE>
@SageHillfarms nothing major just an unusably leaky shower and a lack of sleep leading to a severe lack of will to do things.
Today feels like a day I don't want to happen.

Them: "Dollhouse is a very underrated show. It's really good."

Us: "Marry me."
@SageHillfarms I vote walk
@SamMaggs I will be there! Exciting stuff!!! @AgentsofSHIELD @Calgaryexpo @MingNa @IMBrettDalton
For Lent I'm giving up eating out. You're all witnesses now.

@daeganf we love to loathe him #bittens2
Vevo now works with Chromecast. Cool.
@leven_stund absolutely. We can explore your feminine side in depth <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND TIGHTLY-C>
I left my tv alone and ended up with The Mummy Returns on it. Bleh!
A lot of other shows could learn from the nice fast pace of #bittenS2
@A_SunnySpot ugh. Hope you have a good book.
Damnit I said kill him! #BittenS2
Just kill Malcolm already!!! #bittenS2
“@greystonh: I wish our American friends could watch this at the same time as us Canucks.”
I kinda like having one up on them for once.
Did NOT see that common cause coming #BittenS2
Dear evil witches, just come for Malcolm please? No, huh? That'd be the part where evil comes in. #BittenS2
No, no uh-uh that can't be really what happened 20 years ago. Malcolm needs to die very very slowly. #BittenS2
@SpaceChannel best gif ever #bittens2
I expected something but didn't see that pretty stunt coming! #BittenS2
@SpaceChannel I want to be able to get a @greystonh to fight monsters for me <WINKING FACE>

“@OxfordWords: E L James has nothing on the @OED. Check out our version of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' 
@SamRollinson the back should say "but I did it better" if not, that needs to be a thing.

@GhostoftheRobot watching panicked people shopping for overpriced unnecessary items that'll be half off Feb 15 is my fave tradition.
@SamMaggs accurate review, except the lizard monster special effects quality was my omg I want more of this while watching the movie.
@maureenjohnson the kind that goes in my back or the metaphorical one that makes me stick up for myself? The latter would be best gift ever!
Wearing my @muse concert shirt. I love Muse and they've never let me down. (You guys need to come back, the shirt is wearing out!)
Happy commercialistic prove your devotion with lots of money day. Some of you may know this as Valentine's Day.
@nenshi @thepolicircus it's adorkable!
@maureenjohnson yay!
This would be time to cut myself off from the internet. Happy Valentine's day everyone! (Repeat tomorrow night) 
I'm hungry and tipsy and have no junk food in my house. Clearly my planning sucks.
It's now Feb 14. Dear people into women, you're so missing out but that's ok, being single is fine too.
@SamMaggs I'm jealous of your possession of these books!
Netflix thinks I should follow up #InYourEyes with Marco Polo, proving it makes no sense at all.
This year's pre-Valentine's Day is brought to me by Dirty Laundry Vineyard's Hush a lovely rose wine with naughty quotes covering the bottle
Mini me is rocking her Mandaleye t-shirt from @wearedeified with TARDIS lounge pants. Adorable and also we live on the wrong continent.
Got the waterproof Bluetooth speaker I'd ordered and it's defective. Grrr!
@YugenBliss eek! How exciting!
@ABbrowncoats sounds awesome! I was hoping that the Expo would have guests for the 10th anniversary of Serenity but it's not looking good.
@thinkgeek @reeddiamond @josswhedon I will always miss Dollhouse.
My Whovian obsessive daughter is determined to try fish fingers and custard for real. This happens in the next half hour...
@ABbrowncoats is the hope to do it during Expo weekend? 
It would be wrong to not see Serenity this year!
@ABbrowncoats yay Calgary!
@Allegratastic you're one of us lol fangirl
Watching #InYourEyes because what else does one do on a Friday afternoon? @josswhedon
Braved the psychotic Valentines shoppers and got my post office stuff done.

@maraamritadyers idk! Let me link to where I've seen them.
Dear @SpaceChannel pretty please can we make @bittentv cast for @Calgaryexpo happen?
Trying to stop shaking and hyperventilating... I'm outta here for the night.
It feels like I can't breathe. Everything was going ok and I feel like I've been knocked down to a level without dignity.
OMG didn't see that coming #TVD
@blakcirclegirl it's not that spicy with all the cheese. It's just numminess.
@blakcirclegirl spinach, feta, Buffalo chicken sundried tomato with chunky tomato sauce is a custom blend from a chain up here.
@maraamritadyers this is why there's a market for "shower truffles" aka bath bomb like things for showers.
Happy 5 day weekend lunch with mini me (Teacher's Convention) 
#ChapelHillShooting makes me very sad. I spent some of my youth in that town and it seemed a beacon of hope, not a place for hate crimes.

I'm weak and also possibly stylish. Placed my @blamebetty order to team this with the matching purse

I don't NEED the purse that matches my wallet, but I think I should have it... Right? #firstworldproblems
@2458GP how are we supposed to survive until Lady Midnight anyways, I ask you!
I'm pretty damn spoilt to be able to stream @Imaginedragons in London from my living room in Canada.

@NathanFillion conspiracy theories abound!
@SageHillfarms @MrRolandJohnson is the decor in your closet (aka your wardrobe) black? Lol
@mikesbloggity Tweens talk nonstop about boybands in my experience. They also like buying all kinds of stuff.
Me and my high horse are headed to bed now.
Cyber bullying going on about Sam Smith's wins is appalling. One, he won, two insulting his talent, appearance, orientation is unacceptable.
Beyonce's fans seem really ticked off. We all disagree with something in the Grammys tonight, but it's not the PCAs or TCAs. We have no say.
It's the 57th #GRAMMYs and the first performance in Spanish? Shameful, much?
The hard part about living in a building full of seniors is the frequent ambulances. Hope whomever needed one tonight will be ok.
@Lovewords22 they're doing maintenance inspection tomorrow so it was kind of need-driven
“@TheGRAMMYs: Congrats Best Comedy Album 'Mandatory Fun' - @alyankovic #GRAMMYs”
If this hadn't won I'd have been worried!
Ok, this place is as clean as I can get it. I'd deem mission: clean all weekend a success.
@2458GP if you want something that will be particularly painful, Gayle Forman's I Was Here is good, just really well painful
@maureenjohnson is my car window a public and weird enough place? Almost all the people in my building are over 60 and many have no internet
Just blew the month's clothing budget on @HebelDesign. It's clothing, right?
@Jamiebower good morning to you, you're up early for a Sunday x
Got both loads of black clothes washed today, can't help but question how many pairs of yoga pants I need really.
Just kitchen and bathroom to clean tomorrow to get the place inspectable for Monday, so I'm not doing too badly at all...
@DylanBruce the waiting is oh so very hard, though!
What the hell was that???? #BittenS2 how am I supposed to breathe this week now????!!!!

@A_SunnySpot I made an if she behaved to Valentines deal with her and she's not behaved. Struggling on that.
@A_SunnySpot didn't WWA come out on video though? They didn't tour Canada on that one either... Still waffling over taking mini me to OTRA.

@chenoite my landlord's property management sucks almost as bad as the company they were using before...
I can't have the way to the walls or anything blocked for this inspection. Urgh. Weekend of cleaning!
Notice this afternoon they're doing the annual inspection on my apartment Monday. If it's annual, can't they give decent notice?
@A_SunnySpot have a great time and don't forget to breathe!
Last year there were no concerts in AB. This year there's all the concerts. My budget cannot handle this!
@Imaginedragons are not only coming here, they're here on a Friday! This fight for tickets could get interesting...
Just saw an ad for renting from the new building in my complex. Don't do it - management company is shit!!!

@jodimcisaac oh no! So, the extra 6 months on visuals was well used but the movie wasn't worth it... Bummer.
@Belen_Ariana well, criticizing a teen for breaking out is just insane, unless you know they are lacking in hygiene and even then...
@Belen_Ariana also, defines crappy mum in many ways.
@Belen_Ariana a friend of mine got crap for zits from her mum as a teen, but her mum had gotten weekly spas when she was a teen so unfair.
@Allegratastic they'd been talking for years about a need for a measles booster for adults. I'm guessing it'll happen now.
Thought I had not that much makeup. Bought a makeup organizer nonetheless. Turns out I have enough eye makeup for an army.
@jodimcisaac I've heard good and bad, let me know how it is, please?
@Belen_Ariana and she has enough money for daily spa treatments
@Jamiebower nada happening on my end and my man crush isn't changing <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Getting a tire fixed cuz ya know, that's fun. Hoping it just needs a patch...

If I email a professional from an email address with my name and sign my name, I judge harshly if their reply misspells my name. Seem fair?
@MundieMoms depends on who's hug versus what book <WINKING FACE>
@wilzmak sounds exhausting.
@SageHillfarms looks like you could use those ears as satellite antennae too <WINKING FACE>
@sarahreesbrenna PS if you ever come to Calgary (home of the official world's greatest mayor winner) I'll get a shirt like that made up...
@sarahreesbrenna @nightcircxs we need shirts on DFTBA (or somewhere) that say I'll never forgive SRB and she knows why!
@KaboreStefanie as in, shit wise?
I have a valve in the big vein in my right wrist that fights back enough to bend an IV catheter. I think it needs a name.
@MrRolandJohnson precut into sticks? Lol
@Calgaryexpo @lovegwendoline ooh hope she'll be allowed to talk Star Wars as well!
Happy IV day to me...
TMI Showrunner to screen: a few comments - As you likely know if you’re reading this, our precious Mortal... 
@hollyblack starring Havoc! (And some kinda monster... And the kids...)
Nope, not making it up either! 
Oooh congrats @nenshi I'm so pleased you are my mayor and glad you won world's best!
Snowy Monday, sad face 
@FizzleCollins often networks say make it darker, add more sex, more violence etcetera. This is why I freaked out at the tv idea.
