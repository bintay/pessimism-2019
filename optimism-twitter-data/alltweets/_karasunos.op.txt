@fresharu this is actually the worst photoshoot for u
@fresharu plus he seems to like talking to this other girl in our class (but she has a boyfriend so we're good)
@fresharu NOOOOOOOOOO I DON'T THINK HE EVEN CARES ABOUT DATING RN TBH....
BUSTER KEATON IS SO COOL.....and then he became an alcoholic like his dad QQ

the Oh My God Sun
@jihyesh you must welcome the sun in all its blinding glory and greet it with proper salutations 

OH MY GOD
@jihyesh truly kim junsu is the only one who understands my feelings about our sun
@jihyesh but OH MY GOD SUN is so iconic
@jihyesh wardo figured it was just a thing mark did regularly but now after the realization he becomes rather insulted every time
@jihyesh IF AU SASUNARU COULDN'T GET ME IN NOTHING WILL i sob as i feel my resolve crack
@jihyesh NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I REFUSE TO BE DRAGGED INTO HQ!!!!!!!!
@jihyesh probably wears skinny jeans i' mcrying the image is too beautiful to behold
@jihyesh OH...........NO...............................................
@jihyesh I GOOGLED HIM AND OH NO
@jihyesh wardo doesn't understand why mark keeps repeating "meu deus" so often because he could've sworn mark didn't practice any religion
@jihyesh he somehow picks up brasilian prayers and can't be bothered to pray in any other language with wardo at the wheel
@jihyesh in which case wardo is a speed demon and mark now understands why people hold on to their seats in movies when there's road rage
@jihyesh doing my love proud
@jihyesh burns the computer. burns the entire academic institution down. burns the concept of institutionalized education
@jihyesh I'M SORRY MARK I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE NORTHWEST MUCH IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING I THINK ABOUT
@jihyesh fighting..........! i have five pages left sobs I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS POSTSCRIPT IS EIGHT PAGES lONG
@jihyesh WARDO MARKS THEM WITH SPECIAL MEMORIES THEY HAD THERE and puts a pin through random ones, to mark at least
@jihyesh OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
@jihyesh I WILL AFTER I FINISH ONE OF MY READINGS.............
@jihyesh but he finds that it's not an unpleasant feeling especially with wardo there
@jihyesh chalks it up to the weird shepherd pie they had last night
@jihyesh they visit a brasilian steakhouse and wardo feels so at home and comfortable and mark starts feeling this strange tug in his chest
@jihyesh i'm sobbing at the library desk omg
@jihyesh what have i done. WHat have i Done.
@jihyesh YELLS MARKWARDO AND DINER FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@jihyesh (whenever he has a free moment mining minerals in starcraft)
@jihyesh and wardo has mark skype in during his videos to offer his sparkling commentary
@jihyesh mark has wardo guest on his gamer channel More Often Than Not even though wardo is clueless
@jihyesh then long glorious tales and vlogs of their travels together
@jihyesh AND SOMEHOW THEY MEET UP AT THE NEXT YOUTUBE CON...........
@jihyesh and then someone asks wardo if he's heard of mark's youtube channel, which is obviously imceob*tch
@jihyesh AS LOVE TENDS TO DO
@jihyesh are they tweeting us bc they're amazed at our love or
@jihyesh most of which are not safe for work (but somehow very safe for work in his line of work)
@jihyesh and then sweet beautiful wardo....talking about his time in brasil and whatever questions the audience asks
@jihyesh but just imagine.............twitch gamer mark livestreaming as he does
@jihyesh SORRY 

I LOVE YOU LOTS THO
@jihyesh pops in

@loyalseidisixx and woah that's strange i wonder why professors want you to follow them on social media.........how......weird.......
@loyalseidisixx did you end up unfollowing him or do you still follow him....LOLOL
@fresharu it's just really bad for me bc i totes have a professor crush on him and i respect him so much...........o&lt;-&lt;
@loyalseidisixx LUL did crixell tell you you have to follow him
@loyalseidisixx THIS IS THE MOST REASSURING THING I'VE HEARD
@fresharu it still feels super creepy yelsl

@jihyesh a natural response to the feelings of love you inspire
@jihyesh whispers conspiracy
@jihyesh I'M CRYING WORDS SPOKEN FROM MY LOVED ONE ARE NOT COLD AND LIFELESS ON THE SCREEN BUT ALIVE AND BEATING IN MY HEART????
@jihyesh so i like to sprout this theory whenever it comes up bc POSITIVITY w0o0o0o0o0o
@jihyesh i...i understand..............I UNDERSTAND...................
@jihyesh uwu as long as you are happy with me uwuwwuu
@jihyesh isn't it so interesting!!!!
@jihyesh OOOOOOOOOOOO
@jihyesh TARANTALLEGRA~~~~~~~~~
@jihyesh junsu is perfect so uh he's just doing him
@jihyesh and it'd force jaechun to work on their dancing as well lmao
@jihyesh and jyj got to work on composition and they'd probably be the ones to teach singin if they did start hteir own company
@jihyesh plus it gave yunho the chance to work on his singing and changmin to work on his dancing
@jihyesh it is really interesting though!!! they reasoned that homin stayed bc they were more popular/more...likely to be trusted by sm
@jihyesh I LIKE TO STAY POSITIVE...................
@jihyesh it was a very interesting theory and i like it it keeps me going LOLOLOL
@jihyesh the way they argued the split up between the members made sense as well LOL
@jihyesh and at some point in the future when they're all free from slave contracts they start their own entertainment company???
@jihyesh homin stay in sm to garner contacts and whatnot and jyj do their thing with their musicality and voices and composition
@jihyesh but essentially they said the db5k break...up...was intentional
@jihyesh so it's not rlly my theory it's someone else's theory that i like and have adopted for my own LOL
@jihyesh would you like to hear this theory now
@jihyesh heyo i finished my homework bc it was just a 1 page double-spaced discussion on net neutrality
@jihyesh WAIT NO I CAN'T DO THIS NOW LET ME FINISH THIS HOMEWORK that was due yesterday coughs AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
@jihyesh did i ever tell u about my dbsk conspiracy theory
