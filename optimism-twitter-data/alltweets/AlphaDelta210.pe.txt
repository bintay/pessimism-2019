@xLadyantoniax @David_Cameron her policies towards the poor and jobless where never as evil as Ian Duncan Smith (who loves to torture us).
But would YOU walk over it? Lake District bridge made out of PAPER  
fed up of people who have never been jobless or poor, bashing the jobless &amp; poor....they don't know how bad things are down here.
@1_1_67 as how can you get work if no one will offer you interviews because you're jobless/long term jobless.
@1_1_67 employers, CEOs, HR who discriminate against the jobless/long term jobless and deny them work for being jobless should be punished
@1_1_67 money talks &amp; the poor + jobless should never be punished for their situation but should be helped to get work = money = future.
@1_1_67 people want to earn lots of money, good luck to them but ones who make huge mistakes like recession causers should be fired.
@RomanaBhatti @MibIH @David_Cameron i agree BBC news said that NAZI has kept his job so we jobless &amp; poor better prepare to suffer even more
@1_1_67 for making unforgiveable mistakes, making many firms inc 100 yr old ones go bust and putting millions on the dole.
@1_1_67 money.... IDS loves to punish poor+jobless recession causers been let off, in normal life they'd be sacked &amp; black listed for life.

@rusty685 @ChrisPaulCam then those guys are wrong as looking for work is very hard work and you need to keep looking and not give up.
@RyoxonTricky @BBCLondonNews I never meant that, I meant people have the right of self defense.
6 people followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@rusty685 @ChrisPaulCam i agree and thats down to the parents of those not bringing up their kids right so they don't have kids yet.
@rusty685 @ChrisPaulCam but employers need to give you a chance, if they don't then you will never get work.
@rusty685 @ChrisPaulCam i agree.... work = money = future..... no work = no money = poverty = no future = no life.
@rusty685 @ChrisPaulCam having a job is the best way out of poverty and no future.... with work and living wage you can make a life.
@rusty685 @ChrisPaulCam you can look for work at home via internet and email CVs on spec to as many firms as you want &amp; see if you get lucky
@ChrisPaulCam @rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews work if you're long term jobless so how can you then get work ?
@ChrisPaulCam @rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews you also need to end discrimination against jobless as many employers won't give you
@ChrisPaulCam @rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews and no employer will risk taking you on if they feel you're not up to doing their job
@ChrisPaulCam @rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews disagree you need the right skills &amp; attitude for jobs else you cant do them
@rusty685 like other military/ex military you guys are heros and deserve respect.
@rusty685 that way of thinking needs to stop and people like you need to be rewarded as you risked your life for ordinary people like me.
@ShannaBukhari morning, u look so beautiful but why the sad face ?....compared to me i guess u have a great life &amp; future so be happy...xx
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews true, but money talks so jobless &amp; poor need money to survive = dole money till they get a job.
@WingOfTheRight @BBCLondonNews I was never at the protest and I was never violent, but i agree the idiots make us all look bad.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews only people who get justice now are the rich who can afford #overpaidlawyers and thats wrong.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews the spongers need to be stopped and better systems need to be put in place for non spongers.
@WingOfTheRight @BBCLondonNews we may have had "our" say then but we are still entitled to our views now as this is a democracy.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews if it won't stop then there needs to be other legal ways to bypass over paid £200 + per hr lawyers.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews this needs to stop else poor will always be slaves of the rich &amp; never get justice in a democracy.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews that should have never happened as countless poor people are suffering, lawyer fees need to drop.
@scottdylan when I was in work, if did the 7am shift (on my break) i use to get their breakfast and that energised me till lunch time.
@Telegraph to late now.... should have said that 12 months ago.
@scottdylan #McDonalds their breakfast is good any where.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews by law lawyers need to be made to charge less so every one (not just rich) can get justice.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews i agree, but those idiots dont think like us normal people.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews they caused millions to be jobless and 100 yr old firms to go bust, yet they never got jailed for it
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews i agree, the poor + jobless are easy targets, but million £ bonus recession causers get away with it
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews those idiots don't think and just do it but that doesn't fix the problem.
@rusty685 @BBCLondonNews we ain't having an argument, we are just normally  talking.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews not every one jobless and poor chooses benefits life, money talks so they need benefits to survive.
@rusty685 @BBCLondonNews what I mean is, if some one's life is at risk then they have the right to self defence to protect them selfs.
@GoodnessGates @rusty685 @BBCLondonNews i agree and the press zero in on one idiot and not the point of the protest.
@rusty685 @GoodnessGates @BBCLondonNews thats wrong, but blame our society &amp; parents of now for bringing kids up who have no respect.
@GoodnessGates @rusty685 @BBCLondonNews but NAZI IDS doesn't care, he hates the poor &amp; jobless &amp; will do what ever to financially hurt us.
@GoodnessGates @rusty685 @BBCLondonNews both are bad things, but money talks and no one should have the benefits stopped,
@rusty685 @BBCLondonNews if you're life is at risk then you have to take what ever steps to protect your self, in law thats our right.
@rusty685 @BBCLondonNews i don't agree with vandalism, I agree to having a right to protest in a legal way.
@standardnews by law lawyers should be stopped from charging huge sums so every one (not only rich) have right to law and justice
@Number10gov yes he needs to get his whip and whip IDS back in to line to stop that NAZI from hurting the jobless and poor !!!!!!!!!!!!
@VincintZangari @DiscloseTV looks like a head from an ancient egyption statue.
@Number10gov and bet that NAZI Rt Hon Ian Duncan Smith will keep his job and carry on punishing the poor and jobless!!!! zeeeek hile IDS!!!
@BBCLondonNews the poor and jobless are suffering at IDS's hands so we have the right to protest and have our say as we live in democracy.
@David_Cameron forcing you in to slave labour (welfare for work) etc and bring your dole figures down as no one would getting official dole
@David_Cameron so when you're jobless that insurance pays you until you find work.... that would stop SS (dole office) from
@David_Cameron why can't YOU DC take less tax from people so that money can be used to pay for private dole money insurance.....
@David_Cameron in IDS's eyes jobless and poor ain't allowed dole money etc, so when you're in work why is your wage packed raped of tax ?
@David_Cameron IDS is the only NAZI which hasn't been prosecuted yet..... his policies to punish the poor and jobless have gone to far!!!!!
Photographers Rights: the ultimate guide 
@flyingtri @MibIH @David_Cameron but IDS will never be stopped as a life of jobless or poor is worth less than the life of the rich.
@flyingtri @MibIH @David_Cameron its well known some jobless &amp; poor have died or done suicide due to the hateful policies of IDS.
@flyingtri @MibIH @David_Cameron  flyingtri what IDS has done to poor &amp; jobless=NAZI style hate towards us &amp; that low life will never change
@MibIH @David_Cameron i feel gutted, if I could leave the UK and live in Australia, Canada or USA I would do that now due to IDS.
@David_Cameron so come on DC when is IDS going to open concentration camps or workhouses for us poor and jobless to be forced in to !!!!!
@David_Cameron people hated maggie thatcher but I actually liked her and she was NEVER punished the poor and jobless like IDS does !!!!!!!!!
@MibIH @David_Cameron I agree with you MIB but sadly DC won't, he will let that VILE NAZI IDS carry on punishing us poor and jobless.

@elizabeth030 looks like she's next to Concorde's rear wheels.

@sharpteach @guardian UK public voted for them so no use now moaning about it..... people should have thought about all this on thursday.

@Airbus enjoy as #Concorde was/IS one of your birds. 
@David_Cameron knowing my luck you never read my tweets anyway as to you I'm just jobless scum!!! who should be punished by IDS &amp; DWP !!!!
@standardnews but vandalising some ones property or making threats not the answer, voting IDS out of power and put on the dole is the answer
@David_Cameron yet IDS still punishes the jobless and poor !!!!!!!!! and YOU can but never stop that vile nasty little man !!!!!!!!!!
@David_Cameron so answer that one DC ? you talk so much sh**, you've never been jobless and poor so you &amp; IDS have NO IDEA what its like!!!
@David_Cameron BULLSH**, I worked hard, I paid my taxes, I saved yet the SCUM at the DWP won't give me any benefits or dole money !!!!!!
@standardnews for people hating the torys as IDS never punished the recession causers, he gives them million £ bonuses for failure....
@standardnews this is really bad, feel very sorry for that guy, Ian Duncan Smith &amp; his Nazi policy to punish jobless+poor could be a reason
@staysolid500 except from their clothes and religion, but generally both speak the same language @ShannaBukhari....
@staysolid500 true as they're from the same race of people &amp; standing side by side you can't tell difference between the two @ShannaBukhari
so why are zero hr contracts still classed as full time by DWP and IDS @EstherMcVeyMP when they're not "full time" jobs.
will supermarkets accept part payment for your weekly shop (as you work part time/zero hr contracts).... no they wont @EstherMcVeyMP
will the bill senders always accept part payment of their bills as you work part time/zero hr contracts.... no they wont @EstherMcVeyMP
do zero hr contracts and part time jobs pay full time wages ?.... no they don't, so can you pay all your bills no you cant @EstherMcVeyMP
why say jobless figures are down when most dole figures are based on people being forced on part time zero hr contracts @EstherMcVeyMP
zero hr contracts are part time that's a fact, part time jobs not the same as full time jobs @EstherMcVeyMP so why class them as full time?
Why do those idiots at DWP (dole office) and that moron Ian Duncan Smith think zero hr contracts are full time jobs ? @EstherMcVeyMP
@ShannaBukhari I can say these things as I know u can't see me, twitter won't let u see me, I'm talking to my self so I can say how I feel x
@ShannaBukhari if my probs could be sorted out then I could look at life in a different, better way but no one cares !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@ShannaBukhari it would be more merciful if doctors could give me a suicide pill to end my life and leave this world but they won't do that.
@ShannaBukhari if you're poor like me then people hate u for being poor..... they look down on u, they treat u like u're dirt, like scum...
@ShannaBukhari if u have money then life is good, life is brilliant, life is fantastic and extremely happy and people like u.....
@ShannaBukhari they are more interested in texting on their smart phones or talking on FB or twitter etc than watching where they are going.
@ShannaBukhari world is a very lonely and horrible place for me.....I walk down the street and people just walk in to me like I don't exist.
@ShannaBukhari no one is willing to be part of my life and help me get through these really bad times.... no one cares, the world is a cold
@ShannaBukhari no one is willing to help me with my probs, no one is willing to take the time to talk to me and to be there for me....
@ShannaBukhari they say life is for living, I have no life, no future so why can't I have a heart attack and die... whats wrong with me ?
@ShannaBukhari I feel very unhappy &amp; sad, I miss her more than ever &amp; wish I'd died when she died as I have no life &amp; no future without her.
@ShannaBukhari been applying for work but as usual can't get anything and this plus me grieving isn't easy to do deal with....

@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph if those generals had real solder experience then less of our boys would have died in WW1.
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph IDS's lot r like UK generals in WW1, they knew naff all about fighting the war but still ordered our men to die.
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph why can't they punish HR officers and job agencies who discriminate against jobless and deny us work !!!!!!
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph instead he listens to people who know nothing about being jobless and poor and yet he and they punish us!!!!!!!
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph for people to steal food and get a criminal record means they are really desperate but IDS refuses to see that,
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph so what planet is IDS and his voters on ?... do they know what its like to be poor and jobless ?
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph for people to steal food to survive, for food banks to be used more than ever means things are very bad.
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph but IDS's lot still say "things have never been so good".... good for who ?.... IDS and his bum chums or jobless?
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph if this carries on then the poor / jobless will be forced to rob food from shops etc to survive or do suicide.
@imajsaclaimant @Telegraph their idea of welfare reform is to deny the poor and jobless money to live on and be slaves!!!!!!!

.@The_Big_Hitters i bet these guys won't be part of the "official" dole figures as @George_Osborne reckons unemployment is down !!!!!!
@George_Osborne also that NAZI IDS + SS (dole office) make getting money+benenfits very hard so you can be jobless &amp; not be part of figures
@George_Osborne there are more jobless than the figures suggest but you live in IDS land are thus you have no idea what is going on!!!!
@George_Osborne unemployment claims are down as most jobless inc me don't sign on and claim benefits.... so were not part of figures.....


@mikejoslin @ken4london good for you mike, pity that NAZI Ian Duncan smith can't see that.

@karren_brady if you can't pay the bills on time or don't have money for shopping will supermarkets let you shop for free ?.... no they wont
@karren_brady could you live on zero hr contract where you have no regular wage so you can't pay your bills on time if there is no work?
@WilliamJHague @BorisJohnson ian Duncan Smith hates the jobless &amp; poor and punishes us....is that fare or right ? NO IT IS NOT!!!!!
#bbcqt how can the jobless and poor live if they can't get benefits or cant get work due to discrimination against the jobless ?
#QuestionTime if financial services are so good then why did they need us to save them, why didn't they save them selfs ??? #hypocrite.
#QuestionTime financial services (bankers) caused the recession &amp; we had to save their skins but these people still get bonuses for failure
#QuestionTime the rich can afford higher taxes, the poor and jobless can't afford more benefits cuts but cameron is to thick to see that.
#QuestionTime but Cameron believes that vile hater of jobless  NAZI Ian Duncan Smith that punishing the poor is good, when it ain't good!!!
#QuestionTime Cameron says cutting benefits for jobless &amp; poor is "good thing" but the poor can't afford more cuts &amp; should not be punished
@George_Osborne you will also carry on punishing the jobless and poor via that NAZI IDS and DWP !!!!!!!!!!!
@George_Osborne what about us over 25s ?.... or are we NAZI Ian Duncan Smith and DWPs things to be hated as we are jobless and poor ?

@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron sanctioned or can't find work the SS (DWP) DO NOT CARE!!!! and deny them benefits + money to live on
@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron now your in the press bad mouthing SNP and others + begging to keep your job....when the jobless get
@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron so why does IDS and the SS (DWP) think zero hr contracts = full time work , IDS is your down fall !!
@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron zero hr contracts = part time work !!!!!!! and NO part time work pays enough to pay all your bills!!
@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron so HOW can the unemployed get work !!!!... IDS thinks zero hr contracts = a full time job....
@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron a moral crime but he hasn't punished employers who discriminate against jobless &amp; deny them work !!!
@MurnaghanSky @KayBurley @David_Cameron most unemployed and poor inc me will not ever vote for you!!! IDS has made being poor and unemployed

@TheShilpaShetty if youre over aged 50 then no one will employ you (as employers think you're to "old" when you're not)....
@TheShilpaShetty true but employers never see it that way.... if you're over aged 35 then no hardly any one will look at you....

@andrewmckay99uk @CityAM @ajb338 @FinTechJournal Computer operations in Unix, Linux, Windows, I also build PCs and make websites in webplus
@andrewmckay99uk @CityAM @ajb338 @FinTechJournal having xx degrees but no work exp can't by pass people with 10-15+ yrs on the job IT exp.
@andrewmckay99uk @CityAM @ajb338 @FinTechJournal than some hot shot with a degree but no real experience of the job.....
@andrewmckay99uk @CityAM @ajb338 @FinTechJournal yet I don't have a degree but I have proven experience which is worth more to line manager
@andrewmckay99uk @CityAM @ajb338 @FinTechJournal in my career I did the same job as people with xx degrees but I was just as good as them,

@VincintZangari Linux is free, any one can use it so for corporates etc its perfect alternative to Windows or Solaris etc which cost big £s
@CarvMoore Sun Microsystems where huge, every IT dept I worked in used Solaris, but since Oracle bought Sun, Sun aint used as much as before
@CarvMoore cloud computing has been around since the internet started but the term cloud computing has only been used for a few years.
@VincintZangari Linux will never replace Windows on office desktops as most of that software can't be used 100% on Linux.
@VincintZangari Solaris is still around but after Oracle took over Sun, its not as big as it use to be, Linux taking over Solaris, HP UX etc
@GuardianCareers @EstherMcVeyMP but if 90% of your wages go to pay for bills and travel to/from work then what quality of life do you have ?
@GuardianCareers agreed but to jobless hater like @EstherMcVeyMP and IDS they all think being in work on "low wages" is better than no work
@VincintZangari Solaris 10 is still used in a lot of  IT depts, but HP UX, AIX etc have been replaced with Linux.
Enable Multiple Cores on Windows 7 
would mean I'd have to get Linux versions of these (which isn't easy as I've never seen Webplus or paintshop pro 7 etc etc for Linux).
Unix and Linux are very powerful operating systems, trouble is since 1997 99% of my software was written for Windows so moving over to Linux
@VincintZangari I also have all my notes + books from those days.... I also have x86 version of Solaris 10 and I have Solaris 10 Unix server
@VincintZangari I learned Unix in 1994, Solaris was my first Unix.... a few years later I learned HP-UX, IBM-AIX and Digital true 64 Unix
nothing you lot can do can ever take that away from me.... no go and hide behind your reject letters or walls of silence !!!!!!!!!!!
remember already have many years proven work experience in IT on Windows, Linux, Unix and PCs etc which are still used now in IT dept and
they can go to hell and they can continue to hide behind their walls of silence or what ever as I am not giving up.....
I have a lot of years working in IT and I don't want the doom and gloom merchants to keep me out of IT.... if they are reading this then
@VincintZangari I've been using Linux since around 1998-1999, but in those days using Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc was a lot easier than Linux.
@VincintZangari Linux killed off IBM-AIX, Digital tru 64 Unix and HP-UX
@VincintZangari linux is a PC version of Unix and can be installed on any PC or andriod etc device, its even used on supercomputers and
@VincintZangari to me it doesn't matter, as I come from a Unix background and I learned Unix on sun micro systems hardware (Solaris 7) etc
@VincintZangari I am sticking with win 7 on main PC but I will install linux mint on my laptop to replace XP
@AP_Magazine with film you don't need to worry about mega pixels, you buy the best you can afford and its as good as any modern DSLR.

@SheenieShaikh but they have to stock these items first and cheaply to create a demand so shoppers can buy it.
@SheenieShaikh same here, as when you eat it, it tastes the same but supermarkets don't stock this stuff as they say shoppers wont buy it.
@SheenieShaikh but supermarkets need to sell it cheaply for people to buy it, else that odd shaped stuff goes in to land fill.
@SheenieShaikh they are but so are £1 shops, cheap food doesn't need to be junk, you could get cheap healthy food like odd shape veg &amp; fruit
@SheenieShaikh I hardly shop at iceland, its the main 4 supermarkets who need to sell healthy food at normal price for their shoppers.
@SheenieShaikh if you're on a budget or jobless you can't afford to pay to more for healthy food, so eat what you can afford to buy.
@SheenieShaikh its called money (profits) and stuff the health of shoppers who want the best deals on food.
@SheenieShaikh i mean fans of unhealthy food..... sell healthy food a cheap or cheaper than non healthy food and most people will by it.
@SheenieShaikh i agree its stupid, a few years ago on FB I told a few supermarkets the same thing, but I was told to shut up by their fans

@sdbast senior bankers who caused the recession aren't punished hard and sacked.... instead they get million £ bonuses....how wrong is that.
@sdbast due to them some jobless have committed suicide....yet real murderers aren't put to death, they are kept alive....
@sdbast I agree with you, their welfare "reforms" have put countless jobless below the breadline and off the "official" dole figures.
@sdbast @EstherMcVeyMP @David_Cameron his jobless figures would go down to 0 and then IDS could say there is no unemployment in UK.
@sdbast @EstherMcVeyMP @David_Cameron if was legal and if no one cared IDS would execute us jobless the way hitler killed the jews that way
@sdbast @EstherMcVeyMP @David_Cameron but then we are punished for being out of work and denied dole money etc so how can we live ?

if you can't do the job or have no experience of the job then your degrees don't mean much to your manager, that is a fact.
To these people in power a graduate is the be all and end all of life, but in the real world you can have all the degrees in the world but
Sadly HR officers and recruitment agencies utterly worship and adore graduates (even though most have no experience at all of doing the job)
having raw talent &amp; passion to do a job is worth lot more than some one with a degree but naff all talent, experience or passion for the job

As a website @YouTube is brilliant &amp; its sets standard for others to follow.... its also THE website most people use to watch &amp; share videos
have decided will only convert and update videos @YouTube which are below 360p, anything 360p or higher is fine as originals are VHS quality
.@YouTube now I'll have to start all over again!!! &amp; it will take me many years to find, locate and upload lower quality vidoes to HTML5
@ShannaBukhari nope but u can put a youtube or instagram video link on twitter and from there ppl can see the vidoes xx
converted to higher quality MP4 (if that can be done), not happy with @youtube as it took me over 5 years to convert and upload videos.....
look bad and as the HTML5 conversion on @YouTube has made them look lower quality so all the original videos will need to be found and

. @violetpilot1 that "wobbly air"  is super hot air from afterburners.....#Concorde had the same when she took off.
HR Managers need to change the attitude of their line managers so they can understand delays happen each day, trains etc are to packed now.
days every one else thinks the same, rush hr has started earlier, more trains etc are packed much earlier....so you still cant get on them.
you have to wait for later train/bus or there is a sudden delay on your way to work ?..... its very easy to say leave home earlier but these
on trains etc you should not be punished....As what can you do if the trains/buses you want to take each day are to packed to get on and
#Employers need to be more "human" and stop #clockwatching ....if you get in 5-10-15 mins late each day due to over crowding or delays etc

I don't want to be in the same situation again. Running an emulator/virtual #Windows7 on #Windows10 isn't good enough....
Since demise of XP, countless people have moved to #Windows7, I had to buy new versions of XP software to run on 7 and that cost big money,
In  the press #microsoft are talking a lot about #Windows10, but what no one has answered is will it be backward compatible with #Windows7 ?

.@David_Cameron you could use either the same machines now or use their emulators on PCs to teach kids how to program....its not hard.
.@David_Cameron in schools in the 1980s and most people has ZX Spectrum to teach kids to program and where excellent machines....
.@David_Cameron talk about teaching kids how to program.... also you don't need new technology to learn how to program as the BBC B was used
.@David_Cameron if the press and government had encouraged kids to keep programming from the 1980s - now then there would be no need to
. @David_Cameron the only way to use a computer was to learn how to program it even at a very basic level....I bet even you did that....
press and government @David_Cameron now talk about teaching kids how to program a computer, but in the 1980s (when you was a teenager)
@ShannaBukhari feeling very very depressed and low about some one u deeply care about but have lost is normal.
@ShannaBukhari there are times when I get tired of grieving but can't switch it off as u can't forget some one who was part of u all ur life
@ShannaBukhari living with out her in my life hurts more than ever and the utter sadness I have will never go away....I really miss her

thinking of buying newer photo editing software but not sure which is better #photoshop or #paintshopprox
@ukcraigie I won't upgrade to 10 unless its free or cheap &amp; unless my 7 software can run on it, wish XP was still suported as that was great

on getting new versions of the same software they already have and trust on Windows 7 ? Bringing out a new OS is good but existing software
#microsoft will bring out Windows 10, the question is will Windows 7 software still work with 10 or will users have to spend a fortune

Boris @MayorofLondon @TfL guess what (see PIC) so stop raping the wallets of London train/tube users every January. 
@ShannaBukhari u can't see me so I can say how I feel and know u won't hate me any more than u already do...wish u didnt hate me xx

@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP  is better than living.... its only way they can find peace....to stop suicide you need to stop these problems and
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP most people who suicide or think of suicide are not mentally ill, but they have problems which to them mean death
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP the pain becomes unbearable and no one wants to stop your problems or bullies, I know the government won't do this.
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP no body want's to die but some times suicide feels like the only way out and only way to find peace when
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP stop bullies at work, stop IDS and DWP from being so evil to people....
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP Stop bullies in their families from stealing their homes by using #lawyers and #1975inheritanceact,
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP if you want to lower suicides then start helping people with their problems and give them real hope to live.
@ShannaBukhari despite my recent tweets I'm still grieving, this pain will never stop. The only person who can stop this torment is gone xx
@standardnews he should be fired and black listed from his firm and industry for saying such nasty things....
@ShannaBukhari from any device without the need to use the instagram app only on a smartphone to upload pics to it, thats I feel about it xx

@ShannaBukhari here to show your pics but its not as flexible as twitter or FB where any one with a computer or smartphone can see them.
@ShannaBukhari see them but on instagram unless you have a smartphone u can't see them or upload them.... ok u can put links to instagram on
@ShannaBukhari on my twitter page look at some of the pics I've taken and u'll see I can take good pics, on here any one with a computer can
@ShannaBukhari although u can't see me I've made up my mind, I still really care about u (always have done), I'm not wasting any one time xx
@ShannaBukhari makes no difference to me as I don't use that phone only website, I can't see the point of using something a PC can't use xx
@BBCNews that would probably inc zero hr ones so people "in work" get £0 for most of the time.

@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP your report won't make any difference as government etc don't care !!!!!!!!!! as we live in a VERY VERY cold society
@BBCNews @EstherMcVeyMP but no one cares, no one stops the bullies etc and the only way people can find peace is to end their lives early.
@BBCNews people commit suicide for many reasons inc family problems, lack of work, bullying, money, DWP stopping benefits @EstherMcVeyMP

@ShannaBukhari Her funeral was horrible and I can still see her coffin in my mind, I never thought I'd see the day when she was in a coffin.
@ShannaBukhari I never ever wanted her to die, I wanted her to get better and live and live long as people now live in to their 80s and 90s

@OldeHippi @noordinaryco @AlaskanNovelist @Airbus @airfrance @British_Airways I have friends who where Concorde pilots and they said
.@OldeHippi @noordinaryco @AlaskanNovelist @Airbus @airfrance  and they forced @British_Airways to stop flying their #Concorde s as well.
@noordinaryco @PeterReijnders1 this would a modern version of #Concorde, but no way would CAA allow an airliner to fly with one engine
.@OldeHippi @noordinaryco @AlaskanNovelist its a long story but basically in 2003 @Airbus and @airfrance wanted to stop flying #Concorde
@ShannaBukhari I'm so glad u can't see my tweets Shanna as u'd hate me even more than u do now.....but just saying how I feel right now xx
@ShannaBukhari I love her with all my heart+soul, I did my very best to always be there for her &amp; save her but in the end I couldnt save her
@ShannaBukhari the pain of losing her never stops, its always there and i wish the pain would stop as I am suffering to much....
@ShannaBukhari My life doesn't have a meaning any more.... now she's gone there is no reason for me to exist, yet I do exist &amp; i hate this.
@ShannaBukhari only person who can stop this endless pain is her but she can't come back to stop my endless suffering &amp; unbearable torment.
@ShannaBukhari there are times (like now) when I can't stop crying over and no doctors and no "happy pills" can stop the pain....
@ShannaBukhari  like she was in all my life from the second I was born until time she went :-( :-( :-( :-( :-(
@ShannaBukhari I miss her more than words can say but I know she will never come back, I know she will never talk to me and be in my life
@ShannaBukhari I wish i could stop grieving but I can't, no matter how hard I try the endless pain and sadness never stops, I miss her,
@SteveMoffett I agree and thats stupid as Word 2003 and even Word 2000 are fine, I use Word 2003 and I am very happy with it.
@ShannaBukhari I can't stop crying as I miss her so much, want her to come home but she never will come home, she's now up there with dad xx

@ShannaBukhari the day she left my life was the day my life ended and my soul and heart are tormented and burning in hell xx
@ShannaBukhari every day I cry over her, every day my heart yearns for her but it can't find or sense her in anyway I'm in pure hell xx

@complete_it_pro i.e. if you needed some one to enter their user-id + passwd in software you wrote you could use one sub routine to do this.

@ShannaBukhari I don't know how I can live my life without her, I don't know how I can stop this never ending sadness and pain in my soul.
@ShannaBukhari no one else is in my shoes, no one else can feel or understand my pain, so I feel isolated and all alone.....
@ShannaBukhari i wish i could stop feeling like this, I wish I could be happy but I can't as my heart is shattered in to countless peaces.
@ShannaBukhari I did my best for her, I was always there for her, she never said a bad word to me/against me but now the pain is unbearable.
@ShannaBukhari my heart is aching, my soul is aching and nothing I can say or do can stop or heal the pain, i miss her so so so much....

@HuffPostUKPol @HuffPostUK IDS needs to be JAILED for punishing the jobless !!!!!!!!!!!!
@George_Osborne so elderly are FORCED to lose all their savings !!!!!..... put your money where your mouth is and stop bean counters !!!!!
@George_Osborne of your savings or sell your house to pay for it so what you said is load of rubbish as YOU ain't stopped the bean counters
@George_Osborne for your care if your savings are above £23,250 or if you need to go in to care home you're forced to either pay for it out
@George_Osborne true but if you're elderly, very ill and you need carers to help you, bean counters at local councils still charge you

@TheAA_Help have some humanity and compassion for the soul in need.
@TheAA_Help agreed but when a non member in need calls you for help, don't take advantage of their bad luck and rip them off.
@TheAA_Help then they get no help and are stuck, thats very very wrong and its profiteering !!!!!!! Get your CEO to read my tweets to you!!!
@TheAA_Help you punish non members for having bad luck and then calling you for help.... if they don't pay your rip off emergency prices
@TheAA_Help stop calling your self 4th emergency service as you ain't as you rip people off when they are in huge need and not members.
@TheAA_Help help and they charged you would you pay ? if you called a fireman or police for help and they charged you, would you pay ?
@TheAA_Help price you charge people in need, you advertise your self as 4th emergency service.... if you called an emergency ambulance for

@TheAA_Help as you ain't cold blooded over paid recession causing senior bankers, you AA are meant to help people in need.
@TheAA_Help by doing this your bosses are taking huge advantage of some ones bad luck which is wrong.....you need to change this attitude
been doing more work updating my Concorde trip report website, have tons more to do before its uploaded to the internet.
@TheAA_UK WHY the hell do you take advantage of some ones bad luck ?..... paying £80-£90 would have been ok but £170 = profitearring !!!!!
@TheAA_UK I was out in the middle of no where and had no choice but to pay up, however what you staff did by charging so much was wrong!!!!!
@TheAA_UK a few days ago my car broke down and I had to phone for help and buy AA membership but your staff ripped me off with a £170 bill!!

@theemployable @EstherMcVeyMP @David_Cameron instead IDS punishes the long term jobless with slave labour schemes (welfare for work).
@theemployable @EstherMcVeyMP @David_Cameron and never punish the ones who discriminate against long term jobless and stop them working.
@theemployable being discriminate for being long term jobless needs to be stopped but the government dont care @EstherMcVeyMP @David_Cameron
@theemployable I can't stand on my own two feet and make difference (in a positive way to my life), I can't afford things I want.

will need to make plans to take these pics and get up very early to get to the Thames before sunrise to be in position to take those pics.
Saw sunrise 30 mins ago and wished I was near the Thames with my camera as I've never taken pre sunrise and sunrise pics....
If i do this the car will be off the road for many weeks (as taking that off is pain) but if I get it right car should run a bit smoother.
I'd like to remove the air intake manifold from my car's fuel injection system to smooth out its rough bits but we will see what happens.
@ShannaBukhari sorry to hear this, chin up Shanna. There is no way u can have as much bad luck as I've had over the last 3 3/4 yrs xx

@ConcordeRVP @DelawareNorthUK @HeathrowAirport @British_Airways I'd like to go back one day to see her as I heard she's now in a hanger.
it would be fun to do as one BA #Concorde now lives in Barbados another in Seattle, New York, Filton-Bristol and Scotland + AF ones in Paris
If I ever get back in to work I have a crazy idea.....on my holidays I would visit the new "retirement" homes of every BA and AF #Concorde

@Dr_Black most IT jobs have nothing to do with maths unless you're a programmer writing code of banks etc.
