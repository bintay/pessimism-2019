Bernard Jenkin ‚Äòastonished‚Äô after majority in Harwich and North Essex surges to more than 15,000 
@MattHunter22 @EdCrosthwaite Yeah... in car park in Colchester - just got kicked out of the building!
Bernard Jenkin wins Harwich and North Essex for the Conservatives. He increased his majority from 11,447 to 15,174.
OFFICIAL RESULT: Sir Bob Russell loses and Tories win #Colchester @EADT24 #EssexElects
"DC now got to pick up pieces... he caused division between Eng and Scot... I don't think he's fit to lead UK"
"No complaints... tide took me in" ..."Last 18 years been great..."
"Tide is taking me out"... "Almost sense of relief... Commons fractious... Concerned for UK future" Sir Bob candidly adds @EADT24
Sir Bob Russell is conceding defeat as he speaks, in a very upbeat manner, to reporters here @EADT24 #EssexElects
@MattHunter22 See my previous tweet
Sir Bob has just arrived 
Sir Bob Russell has just told me that "I think you are going to have a new MP" @EADT24
@EADT24 #Colchester #tiredeyes
#Collchester result could be two hours away, and longer if there is a recount, we are warned... @EADT24 #EssexElects
Full story on Bernard Jenkin on UKIP claim that Sir Bob set to lose #Colchester to @willquince 
Definitely no official result for Colchester. Not even started counting yet - although about to. @essexwill @EADT24 #EssexElects
Turnout for #Harwich and North Essex was 70%, up slightly, it seems, from 69.3% in 2010. Again, not confirmed if 70% exactly. #EssexElects
Bernard: "I know that he (@willquince) &amp; his team are extremely confident and very optimistic. They are very hopeful.‚Äù @EADT24 #EssexElects
Turnout for #Colchester just announced - it was 66%, up from 62.3% in 2010 Not confirmed yet if it is 66.0% exactly #EssexElects @EADT24
Bernard Jenkin believes that people of #Colchester feel Sir Bob has had a "good innings" &amp; admits age has maybe played crucial part @EADT24
Adds he is optimistic... fought really long hard campaign battle... but stresses he does not know outcome and says we should wait for count.
Will Quince says he is not taking anything for granted...real positivity this morning at polls and on streets...very different to 2010...
@essexwill See my last tweet - updated!
Incredibly loud reception for Will Quince and Bernard Jenkin from Tories. "Winners", one says. #EssexElects 
Counting is ongoing for Colchester. 2.30am and still no Sir Bob, Will Quince or Bernard Jenkin for Harwich seat. #EssexElects @EADT24
@MattHunter22 @EADT24 Substantiates the rumour we heard two hours ago...
Sir Bob Russell set to lose #Colchester seat to Conservatives, claims UKIP candidate; story here 
Sir Bob could even lose second to #UKIP in #Colchester, John Pitts, #UKIP cand, added. #EssexElects
Tories are set to win #Colchester, according to #UKIP candidate John Pitts. He says it's tight for 2nd him and Bob @essexwill #EssexElects
Still awaiting the arrival of Sir Bob and Bernard in Colchester. Verification of votes still ongoing #EssexElects
All 125 boxes have now been delivered to Charter Hall in #Colchester. No update on Tories winning Colchester seat rumour. #EssexElects
...But a rumour in the media room has it that the Conservatives are "edging ahead" in #Colchester. Will Quince is their man. #EssexElects
No indication yet as to who will win the #ColchesterElection, a source says. Age may play a factor for voters though @EADT24 #EssexElects
Thirteen out of the 54 ballot boxes in #Colchester have been verified by the 70 counters. Nine are 'out for verification'. #EssexElects
Polls close in #Colchester with large turnout expected 
There was a large turnout in Colchester and Harwich and North Essex apparently. 
I am covering the #Colchester and #Harwich and North Essex elections for the @EADT24 tonight. Result expected 4.30am-5am. #EssexElects

An absolute beaut from McGoldrick. Hyam surged forward and teed up the man in form. 20-yard curler.
McGoldrick! 2-0
Helping @ChrisBramms with the #itfc v #rufc at Portman Road today for the @ipswichstar24 and @EADT24. I'll go 3-1 Town; McGoldrick bagging 2

FT: Needham Market 1-0 Great Wakering Rovers. Hosts wasted too many chances but were clearly the better team. Need to be more clinical.
Seven minutes of injury time now. Squeaky bum time for @NMFCTWEETS
GOAL! Needham Market 1-0 Great Wakering Rovers. Luke Ingham scores a corner! Wind-assisted. Fans don't care.
The Needham attacks have diminished in frequency and potency. Late flurry wanted in restless stands. Who will inspire it?
Blistering start by Needham after interval. Newson Cunningham Izzet et al causing chaos. Attendance: 204
HT: @NMFCTWEETS 0-0 @GWRovers. An entertaining but fruitless half from hosts' perspective. Visitors will be happy with stalemate.
Needham finishing how they started: hell-bent on attack, but through wondrous saves and poor execution have failed to make the breakthrough.
Superb save by @GWRovers gk Adam Seal. Cunningham cross found Newson. His flick-on was destined for top-left corner before Seal intervention
Jay Nash smashes the bar for @GWRovers from whipped cross which split defence and gk. Visitors survived opening barrage &amp; confidence growing
Disallowed goal. Needham defender Christopher Hogg heads home corner, but whistle sounds. He used his marker as a launchpad.
Excellent one-handed save denies Daniel Cunningham a headed back-post goal. Swift counter-attack .
Izzet feeds Crisp but his poor, scuffed shot from eight yards is easily captured. Ian Westlake shoots just wide from edge of box. Imminent?
Captain Kem Izzet almost fires @NMFCTWEETS into an early lead from Ryan Crisp's layoff in the box. Fine save from powerful effort.

@davegoods @mark__heath It was heartbreaking to watch it go in... but also vindicating!
FT: #itfc 2-2 #afcb. In the lead twice. In sixth spot twice. Could not prevent equaliser. One point out of six available in three days.
Gerken in fingertip-save drama. Corner for visitors. Injury time.
Cracking finale set up now.
GOAL! #itfc 2-2 #afcb. Deflected and in. Cruel.
Eventually cleared.. counter-attack. Gerken lobbed ball over Grabban but Tyrone is there to clear. Free kick on edge now for visitors...
Headed out for corner. Almost an oggy. Hunt to take...
Howls of frustration as Town revert to opening 35 mins of... almost disgusting brand of passing. Free-kick now though...
20,356 fans just witnessed an absolute howler by Marc Pugh. Scooped over from six yards under no pressure at back post. Subbed immediately.
Surely more goals to come though. I'd bet my Twitter account on it. Murphy flagged when put in behind defence by... Williams.
Green is the colour of success! Substitute, first name Paul, heads home from one yard out from Cresswell fk. Superb finish!
GOAL! #itfc 2-1 #afcb Green!
Abysmal passing so far this half. Nouble comes on for Anderson. I'm trying to convince myself this is all part of the Mick's grand plan.
@Joshy_No4 When you next coming?
One apiece is a fair reflection of the first-half offering. Hope the best is yet to come for the hosts.
Steve Cook allowed time and room to score overhead kick for #afcb from close range. That's woken up their supporters.
GOAL! #itfc 1-1 #afcb. Over-head kick.
@Joshy_No4 Well then... just saying, nice profile pic!
Lewis Grabban inches away from equalising for #afcb. Eight-yard effort squirmed past post. Desperate defending by Town now. Alamo-esque.
Terrific save by Lee Camp. Williams fouled edge of box. Cresswell curler tipped on to post by Camp's fingernails. #itfc been playing possum.
Well then. It was a firing shot obviously from Hunt! Skuse shows urgency and backs it up with action. Fine cross converted by Anderson!
GOAL! #itfc 1-0 #afcb
Cresswell released down left flank by Williams. First time in 35mins #afcb appear vulnerable. Cresswell fires over. As you were.
Double shank from #afcb. Matt Richie slice followed by Eunan O'Kane's ballooned effort. Both in the Town box. Both hilarious. Both derided.
Stephen Hunt drawing some laughter. Uncivilised sliding tackle followed by a blind man's approach of dribbling past marker. Then fell over.
#afcb decide it's finally time to showcase their attacking prowess. A couple of corners and some blocked shots. Will #itfc respond in kind?
Both sides choosing to display their expertise in heading long balls back to their goalkeepers.
Very little action so far at Portman Road. Frazer Richardson at right-back looking sharp. Jonny Williams slowly sparkling. Draws first foul.
Here they come.... 
Hearing from sources #afcb players only arrived at Portman Road at around 2.15pm. @ipswichstar24
Line-ups for #itfc v #afcb. Andy D'Urso is the ref. 
@Stuart_Watson It's a massive game: rubbing shoulders with Stu. Can't get distracted by other shoulder-rubbers. A big test. Lessons learnt.
Saturday's defeat fanned the flames of doubt for #itfc fans dreaming of play-offs. Another would surely mark the end of top six challenge.

@ipswichstar24 Joint review with @callummaclean91 !!
FT: #itfc 1-1 #nffc. Town showed they were the better team but will rue the slack marking in the fourth minute and blunt edge to attacks.
Sub Matt Derbyshire floats a header just wide of post for Forest. Town finding it hard to summon final push for victory.
Murphy thunders home short corner. Nouble with assist. Town with momentum. Fans with songs. But Forest not backing down. Finale set up.
GOAL! Ipswich 1-1 Forest
Forest's delaying tactics grating fans of Town, whose attacks are becoming more predictable and less incisive. Still they hunt equaliser tho
Murphy almost finds top left corner with 25-yard curler. Town revitalised after a 10-minute lull.
It has the feel where, if Town were to equalise, they would be winning within minutes. The first cut is proving the hardest though.
Town seem galvanised since interval. Similar start to first half minus the goal conceded. Williams now has Nouble as his tag-team partner
Town need to capitalise before apathy sets in like first half.
Ebanks-Blake somehow contrives to miss a header form point-blank range! Straight at gk. Smith then has deflected header over. Positive start
@Elliot_Furniss @callummaclean91 Yes it was... unlike Town for parts of the first half!
HT: itfc 0-1 nffc. Town became less dangerous as half wore on. Forest threatening on counter-attack. Over to Mick...
Skuse was the victim of a pick-pocket in the Mackie chance. Gerken's outstretched foot denied a fierce low strike.
Superb stop from Gerken keeps Jamier Mackie off the score sheet... Murphy cross uncontested despite fizzing across the goal.
Frustration is beginning to set in around Portman Road. Poor passes are not forgiven anymore. Ebanks-Blake on for Anderson.
Moment of madness in Town box as Cresswell's clearance from poor pass across goal is blocked. Desperate lunge prevents second Forest goal.
Better marking that time and Town attack ends with Cresswell's low cross smothered by gk. Fine flick and pass from Williams in that move.
Paterson let fly that time from just inside the box and fortunate deflection sees it skim the post for a corner...
Jamie Paterson led the Cavalry charge in counter-attack from Town fk but Blues swarmed the attacker before he fired. Let-off really.
Excellent chance for equaliser as gk spills header from corner but Smith's effort is blocked by a wall of red near the touchline.
First Forest attack, first Forest goal. Town seem unmoved though; Stephen Hunt charging down the left wing and delivering fine cross.
GOAL! #itfc 0-1 #Forest Daniel Fox corner headed home by Danny Collins.

FT: @Felixseasiders 4-1 @OfficialHUFC. League leaders suffer drubbing to closest rivals. Given powerful reminder of importance of finishing.
GOAL! @Felixseasiders 4-1 @OfficialHUFC. Logan deserves his goal. Worked hard since 16min introduction. Header from corner. Game on? (No).
GOAL! @Felixseasiders 4-0 @OfficialHUFC. Tom Dew finishes exquisite counter-attack as Hadleigh's woeful defence exposed once more.
Logan clips bar from pen spot after Mayhew's squared pass. Have to wonder what effect a goal back now could do to both sides.
GOAL! @Felixseasiders 3-0 @OfficialHUFC. Rhys Barber crashes in header from corner. Visitors' defence found wanting again.
Hadleigh still trail Seasiders 0-2. Need to rediscover ability to convert their chances. Speculative efforts traded early in second period.
Cramfield beats offside trap, cuts in, shoots, but ball in slow motion just goes wide.
Unerring and powerful finishes are currently separating sides. Hadleigh have been impotent and wasteful in front of goal.
GOAL! @Felixseasiders 2-0 @OfficialHUFC. Ben Cranfield latches on to lofted pass and coolly finishes.
Meanwhile unmarked Hadleigh sub Richard Logan heads wide from corner.
Almost 2-0 to hosts as Thrower goes to getting second with spellbinding turn and shot. Ball spilt by gk split two incoming attackers.
Best chance for equaliser squandered as Canfer heads wide five yards out in middle of box. Felixstowe's lead is a precarious one.
Mayhew goes down in box but ref decidedly uninterested in Hadleigh pen appeals. Lewis Pemberton booked for poleaxing Hadleigh's Matt Downing
Impressive response from leaders. Ollie Canfer heads just over from corner before Josh Mayhew fires narrowly wide. Full-blooded tackles too.
GOAL! @Felixseasiders 1-0 @OfficialHUFC. Danny Thrower powers home low 25 yard effort from quick fk with Bradley Barber. #Breakthrough

FT: @BranthamAth 0-6 @Felixseasiders. Damage inflicted in 1st half. Horrific defending led to Seasiders blitz. Practice session thereafter.
The inevitable goalless second half has followed the first one. Brantham are much-improved. Attitude is admirable. Seasiders in second gear.
Second half begins at 4.09pm.
Seasiders on pitch 1st after interval. Brantham boss Paul Abrahams going in to injury time for his teamtalk. Tongue-lashing springs to mind.
@davegoods First!
HT: @BranthamAth 0-6 @Felixseasiders. Brantham bruised and battered. Questions raised over defence &amp; tactics. Seasiders clinical and classy.

GOAL! @BranthamAth 0-5 @Felixseasiders. Hands on hips time for hosts. Some fans leave for respite. Clinical move as Cranfield get his fourth
GOAL! @BranthamAth 0-4 @Felixseasiders. And they do. Another ball over the top of back four and Miles Powell sublimely lobs onrushing gk.
Brantham require constructive surgery to mend such a disorganised and fragmented defence. Seasiders eager to add more...
GOAL! @BranthamAth 0-3 @Felixseasiders. A 30-min hat-trick for Cranfield. Even simpler finish as hosts' calamitous defending exposed again.
GOAL! @BranthamAth 0-2 @Felixseasiders. It's a brace for Cranfield as he slides home Danny Thrower's off-target shot at back post.
GOAL! @BranthamAth 0-1 @Felixseasiders. Skipper Ben Cranfield steers visitors into early lead with cushioned volley from lofted pass.

GOAL!!! Needham Market 2-1 Dunstable Town! More FA Cup drama at Bloomfields as Ryan Charles prods home flicked-on corner. Deserved, just.
Needham's battling spirit embodied by Ollie Brown in dogged defensive work and incisive forays in to Dunstable's territory. 1-1
CHANCE! Jamie Guy muscles forward and in on goal but flashes low effort wide for Needham. This game won't finish before 6pm btw.
Still level at Bloomfields. Fans starved of action in mirror reflection of first half. Hosts have tamed an enterprising Dunstable side tho.
Kem Izzet appeared to be pulled down but ref unmoved despite strident pen appeals. Jamie Guy also had header cleared off line in frantic end

GOAL: Needham Market 1-1 Brantham Athletic. Sean Gunn makes amends for earlier howler with low finish from set piece. Poor punch by gk.
GOAL: Needham Market 1-0 Brantham Athletic. Sam Newson with a poacher's goal gives hosts a deserved lead. Low cross turned.
HT: Needham Market 0-0 Brantham Athletic.
Tremendous tekkers from Izzet. Superb control on touchline and nuts his marker. Pinpoint cross moments later. Proving class above atm.
Golden chance for Izzet 12 yards out but somewhat tame effort is comfortably gathered.
Superb reaction save denies Ollie Fenn as hosts assume control with ease. Brantham dedicated and dangerous on counter-attack though. 0-0
Meanwhile Kem Izzet nearly opens account with curling effort.
Sean Gunn finished like Bryan there for Brantham. Two yards out and straight at keeper Andrew Plummer. #HolePlugged
DISALLOWED GOAL: Jamie Guy thought he had broke the deadlock with a neat finish from a free kick but up goes the flag. Hosts finding feet.

FT: AFC Sudbury 3-0 Waltham Forest. At a stroll, the hosts claim a deserved win against basement club still searching for first goal.
GOAL! AFC Sudbury 3-0 Waltham Forest. Forshaw gets his second to add gloss to scoreline late on. Drilled effort from Thompson's knock down.
GOAL! AFC Sudbury 2-0 Waltham Forest! Dave Cowley strolls in to box and smartly finishes. Pounced on loose ball on edge of box. 15mins left.
Still the always precarious one goal lead for the hosts, Waltham slightly improving but still cannot be considered a threat.
GOAL! AFC Sudbury 1-0 Waltham Forest. Thunderbolt from Jamie Forshaw! Almost split the net from 25 yards. Deserved lead for hosts.
HT: AFC Sudbury 0-0 Waltham Forest. Frantic finale. Daniels blasts over one-on-one, GK superb save 2 mins later &amp; Forshaw misses 2yrds out!
Still goalless but home side showing the most promise. More efficient and less prone to errors, but lacking cutting edge as rain emerges
Adventurous start by hosts against fietce wind with Thompson showing intent in attack. Scott Mitchell heads over at corner.
