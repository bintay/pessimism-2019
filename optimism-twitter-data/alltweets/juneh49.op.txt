@BeckyJ27 @screwlabour I know what you mean. I'm a Tory, I accept not everyone likes us. That's fine, we are all entitled to our views.
This has echoes of Germany in the 1930's &amp; Nazi's slogans on Jewish properties. Despicable &amp; has no place in Britain 
@BeckyJ27 @screwlabour They really are frightening in their venomous hatred for anyone who does not agree with them.
@annofarabia @bernerlap @phoenixsrainbow They don't believe in true democracy. They believe in the doctrine of dictatorship
Love my beach <PAW PRINTS> 
@screwlabour Socialists will never listen to facts.
@annofarabia @bernerlap @phoenixsrainbow Their doctrine is one of hate. Can u imagine a Britain under their rule. Stalinist.
@bernerlap Saw her on TV news - BBC of course - she really is a nasty woman. Spilling vitriol out of her mouth.

@PaulDesproperty @rodbishop15 Oh yes!!!
@Fleetblue @rodbishop15 Will Self on the list for me. Think it will be a very long list....
@rob_laird1 @rodbishop15 @Fleetblue Yes I would too. Would be worth every penny!
@Fleetblue @rodbishop15 I volunteered in another Tweet! Let's set up a fund for them!
@DPJHodges Yes, follow example of losing party leaders.
@rodbishop15 Love it. I'll chip in some money for their transport costs <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Great my town no longer has an Independent Mayor. The new Labour Mayor will no doubt rubber stamp all labour councils decision.
Young labour voter on BBC news, saying Labour should go further left. Next generation not  learning lessons from this election

@Vivienne17 LOL well I do have good muscles now from the gym! <FACE WITH OK GESTURE>
...Greens/UKIP? I think it could be. At least until/if Scotland gain independence
I think Labour are on the way to becoming totally irrelevant in Britain. Could this election have marked their demise? Future Tories/SNP..
Well I have obviously done a good job there. Ironed 3 items  and the iron wasn't switched on at the socket! <FACE WITH OK GESTURE>
Another huge problem the Labour Party &amp; their activists have is...the world has changed evolved and they haven't.
@TamPayne2 @ppbrady12 Perfecty and eloquently  put.
@screwlabour @ppbrady12 They have almost unsurmountable problems. Too left wing for England not left wing enough for Scotland.
Main lesson for Labour as they have a postmortem.Don't treat the British public as fools.You did &amp; we didn't like it.So do so at your peril
@MrHarryCole Terrifying and the party they support/are part of may have ended up with SNPs help in Government. I shudder at the thought
@JetNeuf15 day too.

Bertie decided his pet insurance policy is not that interesting, after sniffing it. Even though I've told him it is very important <CAT FACE><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@ppbrady12 mind Jeremy Hunt is such a gentleman he never raises his voice answers all questions calmly. He held his own.
@ppbrady12 @ch4 No!
@ppbrady12 Hear hear. Tories chose an Australian who knows how our constitution works. Lab an American who has no idea. Results show it.
@ppbrady12 and it won't but I want to see how they react, black armband kind of approach. Without Cable they may yet sell.
@ppbrady12 I don't watch Channel 4 I think they are so far left they are almost Marxists. But may watch their news tonight <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@Happy_Mumsy No it isn't. Thanks to all of that generation we have never had to face a WW again. We owe them so much. Xx


@KarenCherwinsky Love the expression on his face!
@Happy_Mumsy It must. Can you imagine going to bed for the 1st time in over 5 yrs and not worry about air raids
We cant say …
@richardcalhoun I thought that. If they voted for them before to keep Tories out.Last night why didn't they switch to labour?
@Happy_Mumsy ...over but tinged with sadness for all those who had died, there was scarcely a family who hadn't lost a loved one.
@Happy_Mumsy I did and my mum. My dad was still in Europe on the actual day. Mum said the street parties were joyous but also relief it was
I cannot really imagine what it must have felt like 70 years ago today #VEDay70 
After almost 6 years of war in Europe, it was finally over

In future elections will anyone bother listening to Polls. How wrong they all got it. Or did the great British public mislead them.

@Vivienne17 No. Hasn't finished her degree yet. Almost a travesty
@Vivienne17 I think you could very well be right. What is going to happen in Scotland? You cannot have one party. Not good for democracy
@scottamylola @MrHarryCole LOL
@Vivienne17 Yes. There are good MPs in every party. It really is turning into a GE like none I have lived through. Not as it was predicted
@VeryBritishDude @annofarabia Agree. A gentleman
@annofarabia @MrHarryCole Im in bed listening to radio. Cannot sleep although exhausted!
@Vivienne17 Not as you know a Socialist. But agree some good labour MPs gone it is sad.
@MrHarryCole Plotting ed's downfall - perhaps?

@annofarabia @wilde @richardcalhoun Thank you!
@AdamLAndersson @RichH1337 @LGBToryUK I don't blame you. However we vote and whom ever we believe in our sexuality has nothing to do with it

@annofarabia @wilde @richardcalhoun Or don't want to. Ann, Richard. Lovely chatting to you tonight. Courteous &amp; well thought out arguments.

@wilde @annofarabia @richardcalhoun Who knows.However I am now retired &amp; I live on a pension I paid for both state and company. I'm not rich
@richardcalhoun @The_Anti_Tory @annofarabia Common Sense answer and is how I and many feel.
@La440Gray @MarkMihayluk Me to. Thank you but he is  a he! Bertie and his is a big boy!
@MontagueBrench Yes. Because it is still just an exit poll prediction. I never believe in counting chickens.....
@annofarabia @heyheyde @wilde @richardcalhoun Ann I am in total agreement with all you say. Never claimed anything from anyone
@annofarabia @wilde @richardcalhoun Exactly. Hard work, nothing else.

@richardcalhoun @annofarabia That is why I am a Conservative. Born in a working class family and proud of it.
@richardcalhoun @annofarabia No but they are hypocritical about Tories,that is what really annoys me.I'm all for people bettering themselves
@MontagueBrench I agree. This is the problem on election night. We have to wait hours for results to come in, so they speculate away.
@annofarabia @richardcalhoun Exactly!
Ah David Blunket's guide dog is fast asleep on the ITV studio floor. Bless him
@richardcalhoun @annofarabia No but they act as though they are working class.
@MontagueBrench I love my wine too. Had a large glass earlier, so tea now! Cheers <WINE GLASS>

@oldhamowlhootie @ppbrady12 @annispice  No! Sadly.
@AtticusBakelite @FelicityMorse I didn't claim it had. But at my age it was an interesting fact. From now on it will become commonplace
@JetNeuf15 A very good motto to live by....and as the old saying goes. "It isn't over until the fat lady sings"


@JetNeuf15 Andy I love your optimism <GRINNING FACE>
Decided to cheer myself up and watch #bbc4
@JetNeuf15 I  hope so. But my faith in human nature was buoyed by the good nature of majority of voters at local polling station today
@ppbrady12 @annispice Guaranteed!
Just realised this is the first election in my lifetime that Social media has played such a large role. #GE0215
The more spy films/TV series I see I.e #TheGame the more I realise what a master of the genre was John Le Carre.
My cat is sad if #VoteConservative don't get in his days of tuna and treats are over. My taxes will shoot up<CRYING CAT FACE> 
There is an actor in #TheGame a jobbing actor in lots of TV. I don't know his name.But he must have best Agent in the business.He can't act
@ppbrady12 @annispice ... Bad enough but boy oh boy they don't know what Pandora's box they may be unleashing.
@ppbrady12 @annispice Ansolutely agree. One big problem is do many have not lived thro real socialism. They on,y know new labour, which was.
@ppbrady12 @annispice  for they are a Pact made in hell and they will fight each other- hopefully to the death
@ppbrady12 @annispice All I hope is if the nightmare scenario happens.It will implode &amp; we have to have a new election in a few months time
@annispice @ppbrady12 Lucky you.
@ppbrady12 @annispice I have to say @RuthDavidsonMSP is impressing me greatly. Hope for both our party and the country. She is modest too!
@ppbrady12 @annispice Me too! I remember the grim 80s when we were literally a basket case. Held to ransom by the Unions.
@annispice @ppbrady12 I Fear you could be right. A left wing Scottish socialist party ruling England. That is not on.

@Lol58Milne @Vivienne17 @ShowcaseCinemas @RoyalOperaHouse Absolutely. There are thousands of us want and need this.
Yes it was. One of the advantages of seeing ballet at cinema, is the behind the scenes footage. I really enjoy it. 
Quick workout at gym today. School Governing duties this afternoon. Love to be busy.
Excellent article 
@TheRoyalBallet Wonderful, joyous. Laughter rang out at my local cinema. It really is a special ballet.
It seems I am going to Sydney at the wrong time of the year to see a ballet @SydOperaHouse Shame, I miss a modern ballet by 1 day!

@Vivienne17 @ShowcaseCinemas @RoyalOperaHouse is an excellent way to see ballet. I go to all the cinema performances

@annofarabia they would be fools if they did and I'm sure they are not!
@annofarabia I knew that really. So these 2 parties are prepared to destroy livelihoods for their beliefs. Beggars belief.
Pleased to see a lot of people not clapping Nicole Sturgeon every time she speaks. Not all being taken in by her.
A naive question.What will happen to all the jobs of the workers who build Trident. Will there be mass unemployment if Lab/SNP win?
I'm finding the Scottish #leadersdebate very interesting

2-3 years longer to reduce the deficit under Ms Sturgeons plans. Doesn't she mean decades. Don't trust a word that comes out of her mouth
@campbellru24 I rest my case!
