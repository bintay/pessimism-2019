Tories to make the EBac compulsory if they win the election 
ToxicToryManifesto putting even more emphasis on TESTS and that flipping EBacc which is ruining young people's lives.You just don't get it.

@colleenkr and the boys need to see the point of subject so we need more emphasis on vocational/careers/craft/digital/design. @TheAgenda
@colleenkr predominance of female teachers leads to a feminisation of the curriculum so turns boys off-
@ColleenKR @TheAgenda thanks for that. National and worldwide problem but achievement gap in Art (UK) is a major concern.Boys 'drop' art 2.

Excellent day interviewing art educators.@balticmill re gender gap in subject. 
Oh what joy to see these two together at last! @BobandRoberta and the real Mr Gove. #arthistory #democracy 
@JillPiddock @balticmill would love to see you today- meeting on level 2 at 1pm. If arriving after that- we r in the Launch Pad room.
The right to protest? 
@balticmill day with fellow art educators. Bring it on. <SQUARED COOL>
@HelenAckroyd thank u! You know how it feels to win too. <GLOWING STAR>
@JillaineReay @SharonHodgson_ Sharon has earned my vote. #moreartnotless #nsead #appgartcraftanddesign #listeningear @DRLT @JasmineTeapot_x

Mediocre Failures 
Marvellous creative thinking with Learning team@balticmill this afternoon. We have some gr8 CPD planned for the next year. #moreartnotless


@mrsrfoster @nataliewalton78 @harrietharman Harriet should spend an afternoon with an inspection team. Soon.
@photopedagogy agree so let's end the federation and academy lockdowns which are happening across England. They don't share.
@ajbrewerton @abiellison @HarrietHarman absolutely- OFSTED are being used as 'threat' and the 'in school' belief/commitment IS the key.
Art Thursday with meetings at both @LaingArtGallery and @balticmill and hopefully creative plotting together.
‚Äú@sajidjavid:Incredibly talented head of @britishmuseum Neil MacGregor stepping down.A cultural giant &amp; fantastic public servant.‚Äù Join him?
@michaelejudge @HarrietHarman clubs are extra- curriculum is MOST important thing to address. #CultureDebate
@c_crampton @edvaizey spends a of his time at round tables as he's just happily going in circles all the time. #CultureDebate
@BullDeborah great idea but too dangerous for politicians to allow the real experts to have a say!
#CultureDebate #NAEAD have sent @edvaizey stats about differences arts entitlement state and private schools- did he even read them?
‚Äú@DenisMacShane: Why is Sajid Javid not at major Cov Gdn #CultureDebate to defend ConDem record on arts?‚Äù Totally important question!
@HarrietHarman #CultureDebate what about lack of #OFSTED people who have any idea about the arts then? #won'twork
@Creative_Fed @HarrietHarman  the north loses out in everything- Arts included. #CultureDebate
#CultureDebate maybe it's time we closed down @ace_national  then?
#Culturedebate topsyturvey politics where so much money is wasted in high wages in banking for example and I can't afford a theatre ticket.
@rebekahellerby sort wood from trees by looking at party records over past 5 yrs.
@inthewrongcrowd @TheRoyalOpera @Opera_North #swanhunter set is nearest these politicians will get to Newcastle! #CultureDebate
@MissMediaGamer no I'm not as it would cost me lots to travel there in that Deep South of London! #bringitnorth
@CultureatKings @HarrietHarman  so get on a train and come "up north" or drive that pink van up here !
The fact that #CultureDebate is taking place in the south of England says it all! #theforgottenNORTH #inequality
#CultureDebate how many of the politicians on stage have a qualification in the Arts?
@Creative_Fed @edvaizey @Conservatives #lazyvaizey? Make sure he's awake then.
@southbankcentre #CultureDebate versus #Masterchef ? Nope- you may lose out there!
#CultureDebate some FS and academies offer NO arts at KS4. To whom are they accountable I ask? #moreartnotless I can name and shame btw.
#CultureDebate will a Labour government correct inadequacy of arts national curriculum guidelines for arts and include Drama as a subject?
#CultureDebate many arts teachers in primary schools have little (or no) specialist training or access to subject specialist CPD. Discuss?

@BBCGetCreative #culturedebate what can we do to change school accountability tables which are marginalising the arts- inc Progress8 ?
@DebatingMatters

@brown_wills I actually love that stark grey architecture. Very Victor Passmore.


@elinorbrass @sketchbkcircle @CreativeNorton @Miranda_July hopefully a Vote Labour election banner! #VoteLabour
@Number10gov are u still Prime Minister? Thought we had dissolved you? #rollonelection
@JonathanBadyal @Fox_Claire @edvaizey and possibly the most ineffective Arts Minister? #lazyvaizey
@warwickmansell no DFE didn't ever look at EBacc certification. #pieinthesky
Spring is here in @washingtonvillage and a riot of colours. Lush. 

@creativetallis @DevNicely @NSEAD_Sophie @Livestream @eyebeams we can make this a#NSEAD Conference to remember. #moreartnotless
@DevNicely @NSEAD_Sophie should we look at @Livestream @creativetallis because we need to!?!?!?
@escapetocreate @TCMargate possibly as there is nothing else to do in Margate?
@DevNicely @creativetallis @NSEAD_Sophie potentially a superb idea- like a fringe event at political gatherings.
Jaysus but@Eurovision celebrates 60 yrs of utter crap tonight on #BBC. Pass me a gun. It's all over.
Here's why I'll be voting Labour on 7 May. What about you? 
@creativetallis @nsead_sophie @lbnsead @devnicely the power of an image, the ability to read that image, the meaning in what you create.
@jillainereay been to many a #TM but feel we NEATEN have a better format. Much more opp for reflection. #reflectivepractitioner
#TMLondon gr8 idea but art teachers north east have been organising their own CPD since 2007. Worth talking to us about it's effect.
#TMLondon time you spread out northwards don't you think?
Fabulous blog re our Hanoi Big Draw Adventures. 
@ChrisBryant4MP it's cultural opportunities for young people, being denied thru education reforms, which devalue the Arts at all levels.
Happy holiday to all you amazing, inspiring (and tired) art teachers/educators. May the sun shine on your weekend! <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>Ô∏è
#leadersdebate well who on earth convinced any of you that you could be leaders? Sooty and Sweep would do a better job.
‚Äú@obrigo1: @theartcriminal it's such angry making bull! Politics not policies. I'm going to #masterchef‚Äù me too- nice puddings! Mmmmmmm
‚Äú@Jeremy_Hunt: #leadersdebate 10x more people waiting for operation in Wales where NHS run by Lab‚Äù and where did u come from? Narnia?
#leadersdebate deserting you for a Middle Eastern rice pudding on #masterchef . #noregrets
#leadersdebate even worse- WE ARE ALL MISSING #masterchef FOR THIZ ! Arggh but I need a nice pudding. <ICE CREAM>
#leadersdebate looking like the Eurovision Song Contest- noisy, crowded,competitive, dull, and I can't remember the lyrics of any of them.
#leadersdebate @LeanneWood is unfortunately carved from a piece of wood and possibly #mdf from Homebase. #splintered #plaidcymru
#leadersdebate nicola you are talking sense! Sadly though you are Scottish. Farage doesn't get that.
#leadersdebate not impressed by Welsh contingent. Enjoying Farage outbursts. Green Party- get a better speaker. Ed is warming up.
‚Äú@IDS_MP: Posted without comment #leadersdebate 
#leadersdebate Nick has had his grey hairs coloured. Dave is a pompous twit. Ed needs to find his soul. Nicola strident. Mmmmmm
#partyleadersdebate lack of tweets show that I might be one of 25 actually watching this! #Farage at least seems animated. #tonybennRIP
#partyleadersdebate come on Ed- show more passion. You made a statement but I need to see your heart bleed.
#partyleadersdebate Welsh woman sounds like an advert on a local radio station. Rather dull.
#partyleadersdebate very well rehearsed one minute from Cameron. Scripted. Spouted. As much use as a chocolate teapot.
#partyleadersdebate no doubt @nick leg has had his grey hair camouflaged for this debate.

Shucks! Beat the Mastermind specialist subject contestant on Mary Shelley just now! #unknownskill
#moreartnotless I love my job, I love the people I meet, I love being able to pick up a piece of anything and make my mark on it.
‚Äú@educationgovuk: DfE to support creation of a new, independent owned and led by the teaching profession - MESS IT UP THEN DUMP IT?

And my question to 'grown ups' is 'what have you done 'at work' this week that needed you to be creative in thinking and in doing?'
Parents- ask your child today- ‚ÄúWhat has my child made with their hands at school this week?‚ÄùAnd support @accessart and #NSEAD all the way.
All trains on time and that's 5 in two days. Tis a miracle! Well goodness me-  there'll be an eclipse of the sun next!
@DevNicely @creativetallis I'll certainly be at Conference. Think we need to think about a resource bank for teachers? Blue sky thoughts.

Join the debate at

Ending a busy week with a selfie from me, #nsead and @gEd4art @InfoWylie @NSEAD_Sophie because we care 'bout art ed!

#TEShustings @LBNSEAD lining up to give @TristramHuntMP a copy of #nsead Manifesto for Art Craft Design Education! @NSEAD_Sophie
#TEShustings #arts generally ignored tonight apart from a final Hunt rush. Tut tut.
#TEShustings ah bless @TristramHuntMP because he just waved the flag for creativity! Essential to the curriculum. 
@teshelen @NickyMorgan01 think she should stick to Loughborough and her marginal seat!!!!
@OHaganCarmel #Teshustings you don't. It appears to be fixed.
#TEShustings politicians dominating what is meant to be an audience led debate. So- DO THEY EVER LISTEN? I don't think they do.
#TEShustings what r u going to do to stop the marginalisation of the Arts in schools due to accountability measures which don't support them
#TEShustings got an important question to ask about Arts education and I'm in this audience. Don't ignore me.
#TEShustings stop them talking at length and give the audience more time.
@tes hustings hearing @NickyMorgan01 praise the EBacc...damn the EBacc I say. 
#Nsead and doing my homework on the train- more protocol to study! @artaddict33 politics is 'weighty'!
Always get excited when meeting my #NSEAD colleagues so a grand day in Westminster coming up with @NSEAD_Sophie @LBNSEAD and many more.

Very excited that @ChrisBryantMP will be at our nxt APPG art craft design education on March 11th.Looking fwd to hearing yr views + beliefs.
@NorthumbriaPCC @ArtistsUnionE so much for free speech then?

#Neaten #intellect
Interesting week. @UKLabour @LabourArts have said more than any other party re education and the arts.i know where my vote will go.And You?
Running new course @ Rufford Crafts Monday- our focus is Visual Literacy.I'm prepped and raring. Some gr8 activities plus theory 2 support.
I'm a right softie cos I always loved Mr Spock and even styled my hair on his in the early 80's. #LeonardNimoy #StarTrek

Governor duties this morning and @HummersknottAcd this afternoon- working with two lovely art teachers looking at using Photoshop.
@educationgovuk @NickyMorgan01 she didn't answer questions in that last tweeting fiasco.
#artcubed @Jobaker9 a little late but here's my @sketchbkcircle cube. One amazing day. 75 amazing art people. :-) 

Excellent to hear Ed's supportive speech on creative and cultural education. @LabourArts @LabourLordsUK @WhitchurchGirl


Amazing diverse resources and case studies to support quality art teaching - well worth sharing.  
@CreativeNorton @sketchbkcircle Charlie's giant party popper! Hope this prototype works. Leonardo would be proud!
@BBCGetCreative brilliant idea BUT don't fall into honey trap of Arts being an educational add on. Should be integrated into curriculum.
@BBCGetCreative and when was the last time @TonyHall or @alanyentob were actually in a school classroom? #moreartnotless #seethereality
@BBCGetCreative because the Mumsnet brigade can all offer extra curricular Arts but we want ALL kids to have this every day in our schools.
Very important that Arts and creativity are embedded in EVERY child's curriculum entitlement and are not seen as a weekend/after school opp.
#BigPaintingChallenge #daphnetodd is a teachers nightmare. Set in her ways. Worst kind of teacher. :-(

@NSEAD_Sophie @DevNicely two males out of 24 at my PGCE session in Brum last week.
London bound. @sketchbkcircle exhibition put up today. Opening and workshops 2 Moro. What a weekend! #moreartnotless 
PGCE places given on merit. Not enough men r applying.
@DevNicely @NSEAD_Sophie on our local PGCE course it's 7 to 1 in favour of girls in last five yrs. The SCITT r all female last 4 yrs.
@DevNicely @NSEAD_Sophie 4% of women overall are HTs. John Knowles completes his art specific leadership research soon.
@DevNicely @NSEAD_Sophie DFE only produce gender stats overall. 74% all teachers r female. I'd guess higher in Art.
@gezy I believe banking comes second and no other sector is near the Cultural Creative figs but hey- Tories hide the truth!
@gezy well said, we also need to showcase those that do support the Arts too. HTs need to have courage.
and if you don't address it then expect a huge gap where there doesn't need to be one, nor should there be one. END.
But evidence shows that it is being marginalised in all key stages. Who- at govt level- is going to address this?
UK's Creative Industries are now worth ¬£76.9 billlion per year to the UK economy. So, we should be encouraging Art and Design in schools?
@den_1971 @robinredress no- but I hear she's a mean painter. Well both of them are art legends- Bacon and Stubbs!



@den_1971 @robinredress missed you all but you wouldn't want to hear my consumptive coughing for long! Getting better tho'-hope u r 2. xxx

@DRLT does Jasmine have a Twitter account?





Are you a new Art subject leader or an aspiring one? Then join me on this one day course:

.@manutd The players make millions of pounds a year, time to pay the rest of your staff a living wage! 
@AnneQuinton totally agree. The trainee teachers are full of enthusiasm too and need to see art work which isn't drawings of dusty bottles!
@AnneQuinton showed yr Circle drawing project to Art ITT Students yday. V. Enthusiastic response. #moreartnotless
I need to go to Italy with Andrew and Giorgio. #bbc2

@Holyhead_Art successful Art tweeters are often independent of school. Worth u asking though. #tweetart

@Holyhead_Art as we did in north east- a demo at network meeting. Ask Ros if u can dem at nxt A4MAT meeting. Practicals work well!

‚Äú@educationgovuk: .@NickyMorgan01 outlines her plans to tackle teacher workload: 
@mrsartytextiles  @NickyMorgan01 indeed. So-do what you always do so well 2 inspire young people and put faith in common sense from above.
@mrsartytextiles @PurseZoe @NickyMorgan01 there has to be a complete culture change. Top down not bottom up. Come on Nicky-do something.
Well maybe you fancy an alternative vote this year? @LibDems look so enthusiastic 

‚Äú@educationgovuk: Your ideas #workloadchallenge: ‚Äòwe have introduced a new marking system‚Äô 
Excited (get a life Susan) as it's #NSEAD Council meeting 2moro @balticmill and I just love being with all those pro active art advocates!
@theresaeaston @Design_Week @BobandRoberta there is no joined up thinking at all in this government. That's why Arts ed is in neglect.
Last nights Question Time panel really didn't connect with me. Where did they go to school? 
Great thinking and discussion at @ALC_uk @CapeUK today on gender imbalance in Arts ed and organisations.

Come on @TristramHuntMP you need a much better stronger response to Cameron and Morgan today. How about some policies with balls?
Cameron- we'll sack headteachers if they are no good. Well, let's apply that rule to Prime Ministers then. Go away Dave.
Nick Gibb on Radio 4- let's whip the teachers again- clearly it's all their fault. Lazy and inept. Unlike him on current 2 day week.
So the Education Sec couldn't answer what 8x7 is on breakfast TV. I think that's possibly pot calling kettle.
@VerulamCreative @Verulearning that's such positive support for yr students when they have so many other commitments to juggle with.
@obrigo1 @sketchbkcircle and so you shall- for my eyes are growing dim. 
@NickyMorgan01 says in @SundayTimesNews that Labour failed a whole generation in education. I beg to differ. Margaret Thatcher did. Often.
@kentartteacher one more tip- passion and enthusiasm about what you teach is the way to be outstanding. Shine like a light.
@kentartteacher tip- be topical and bring what's going on in the world into the classroom. Example #CharlieHebdo and art.
@Little_MissJoJo then let's vote them out. I think the Tory brigade have well and truly lost the teacher vote. #timestables

@TheUrbanJester @ArtistsUnionE why not ask @NSEAD_Sophie to include it in #Nsead e- bulletin as well?
Tory party plans to destroy childhood and get their way by bullying schools. 
So enjoying @sketchbkcircle and being involved in #drawing and #thinking and loving it. So- #whatdoyousee? 
There are places left for our #NSEAD CPD course Where Have All the Boys Gone in Leeds April 30

@mrsartytextiles @sketchbkcircle @elinorbrass @olivethethird that's so visually exciting! I'm sure it's as tactile as it looks too.
@MrSRFoster @nataliewalton78 and it was worth it. She deserved my socks in her face.
@CreativeNorton @teshelen it looks fab esp the cover. I love the way kids see the world. It's more accurate than we grown ups know. :-)
When Nicky Morgan was on BBC last nite talking in defence of league tables I threw my socks at her. Felt much better since. @NickyMorgan01

@MissBsResources @CreativeNorton sadly our government thinks it is about passing or failing and judge us all accordingly.
@CreativeNorton @theartcriminal @MissBsResources I did Latin! Failed that too. V. useful tho when visiting Italie.
@stjohnsartdept @Holyhead_Art take care- you have ventured into "drawing peppers" territory.
@CreativeNorton @MissBsResources I failed Maths and Art first time round. But.... It hasn't held me back!
@sketchbkcircle #sketchbookcircle15 @obrigo1 just a tiny glimpse. Or else I would give the game away. 
@obrigo1 @sketchbkcircle Bombay mix- what a coincidence! Just had a handful for lunch! Happy days making art.

NEATEN TEACHER SESSION ON PLANNING GCSE ART EST Lord Lawson School 15 Jan 4:30-6:30 all welcome. Big resource/ideas share. @andy_prest
Am so excited for 2moros #honleycpd Honley Schools Partnership training day on Creativity. I just hope it inspires them on a cold Monday!
‚Äú@accessart: begins the new year presenting Inset at @lawdale junior school London &amp; a Liverpool Primary School 



Any art educators living in Surrey Heath who might like 2 contact me please?
I will let you know why if you respond. 
@exploredrawing exactly- we learn via memorable experiences and our young people need much more of these.
And on the subject of Creativity-all curriculum models should be creative in content and the way they are 'taught' 
Running 2moro's #honeycpd Honley Schools Partnership inset day on the theme of CREATIVITY- what a great focus. 
@daveakasarah then maybe it's time to do it! Or else I might scream. 


‚Äú@Jobaker9: Distracted from school work by a fashion designer <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> target on my #Nurture1415 my kids win 
@mrswardsta you will love @sketchbkcircle and ENJOY!
@Little_MissJoJo stop eating flipping peanuts then.....
‚Äú@sketchbkcircle: ¬£18 Stillman &amp; Birn or 95p Muji sketchbook- which would you prefer? I bought my last one in Paperchase so Muji would do!
Feel as if the holiday never happened as I launch into all the January prep work. All good creative fun though.
