@settersyd I HATE IT TOO! BESIDES PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRY TO SEE THE GOOD IN THE BAD AND SEPARATION WOULD PROB HAPPEN LEAVING PEOPLE HOPELESS
@settersyd wed end up with evil genius couples that would be terrifying. But we could find companionship so much easier, life would be light
@settersyd BECAUSE THE BAD&amp;GOOD PEOPLE TEACH US LESSONS &amp; EXPERIENCES AND IF LIFE WAS THAT WAY WE WOULDNT LEARN EVERYTHING GOD WANTS US TOO<FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>
@settersyd that would solve so many issues. It could also help figuring out who a fake friend is and everything. I wish this could happen.
@settersyd IF THAT WAS REAL YOU COULD ALSO WATCH SOMEONE CHANGE AND THAT COULD EITHER BE HEARTWARMING OR DEPRESSING
@settersyd that would be the best thing ever and some people would be screwed
