Thank goodness I work all day and get to skip all the mother's day posts <RELIEVED FACE>
We girls are good at following if you take initiative, but only if we like you back
Rather have a guy tell me straight up why they want me than one who's going to fake feelings just to get what they want. Both are pigs tho
"Letting go? Not as hard as holding on to something that wasn’t real."

Lmao 
If only I knew how to drive standard <NEUTRAL FACE>
I'm honestly hating myself rn for making a big deal out of nothing
I'll buy myself cute stuff and compliment myself <RELIEVED FACE>
Like wth I'm not about to be a man for ya. I can be. But for myself not for you. Lol
Guys forget that it's up to them when it comes to initiating anything
Happy but upset because it wasn't supposed to happen.
Oh ...
Man I'm starving
Nvm. I know it's not. It never is.
How do you know if they're fr?
It's really not that hard to be loyal

I was getting my life together until you came along, now you're branded in my memory and you're not even here.
@Frosty_Andy but like, you're already short<INFORMATION DESK PERSON>  how much shorter can she be? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Overtime we've returned to where we belong
I know everyone wants a reaction from me but I already knew so just leave me alone
Mr. "It wouldn't be fair to you"
Does it hurt? Hell yeah.
Estefania gave me the best advice. I love her :')
No more distractions
I almost lost my focus for a bit. I have to remember who I am and where it is that I am going.
I could really use some carne asada fries rn
Ew. Can you not?
Took my nap but I think I need another hour or two... or three
I'm wondering what you're doing right about now
But it's okay though because my last day is tomorrow <WINKING FACE>
Barely saw myself in the mirror and I can't believe I went to school looking like this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Or how about nap and then study?
Nap or study?
@Tanairim7 I know, I don't really need it lol
I'm up so I want to clean but then I also want to take a nap. #DecisionsDecisions
@Tanairim7 lmao and be able to swim <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but yeah they are. I'm between 200 to fix my phone or new contacts for next month <NEUTRAL FACE>I hate my glasses
If bothers me how shameless guys can be nowadays... I know your mama taught you better
Lmfao 
I have the wrong person on my mind. <WEARY FACE> This wasn't supposed to happen. This sucks
No better feeling than a fresh pair of contacts <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
About to put in my last pair of contacts ... that's one more thing to add to my list. <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE> 
And I wonder why I'm broke. Smh
If you want to act like I'm not freaking hilarious and want to be a grouch and not laugh along, then you know what, God Bless.
Seriously 
don't compare yourself to other people, we all have a different path to take. you're doing well, keep going, thin…
I refuse to be one of many. I actually have respect for myself <RAISED HAND>
No one made you talk to me. *kanye shrug*
Ugh my face is dirty and my blackheads are worse than ever
How do you forget someone?
Oh...
@placidpandaa lmao you saved yourself this time
@placidpandaa paradise bakery??? Traitor... lol
Love that everyone leaves me hanging at the same time
I don't believe this is really a nonstick pan
Kind of do, kind of don't
That's so true <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Jeez im starving
When the lighting is not on point. #selfie 
You know when you want to talk to someone but you don't want to bother them? I'm like that rn
If it won't lead anywhere why waste each other's time?
We're better than that
Why would I be an exception?
I have to remind myself of who I am before I do anything stupid
Where are all you people the rest of the days of the year?
That Star Wars May Fourth phrase was played out this year. I hated it.
I'm in a pickle
Lmao!! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @Tanairim7  
@lucero_lovee that's so bad! Lol you need to include your family at least
@Tanairim7 yes!!!
If I wake up in a pile of rubble just know I love you all.
So like, this thunder just shook my home. WTH
My mom just told my sister to stop singing lol how rude
@journey_218 @lucero_lovee lmao my sister did this until we told her she has to allow us to call her cause what if there's an emergency lol
I can't even <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><WEARY FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
I feel so fat again
LOL highlight of my day :')
So I was watching my baby Blake today on tv during my break and this little girl sat next to me and then told me I was pretty..
My apron is disgusting but I have no time to wash it <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Finally I can go to bed <WEARY FACE>
So yeah, that's it. Good morning Twitter. Lol
My convo last night made me realize a lot. I don't plan to look for love, I'm going to wait for it to find me :)
@JCelis13 your face
I'll wait years if I have to, but I know someone is out there.
I believe love and good relationships do exist and somewhere out there is a guy willing to love me and treat me well who won't cheat or lie.
I guess it's just the memories I miss. People change and it's something we have to live with.
@FJM_TX lmao ok
@FJM_TX I just have faith in God and try to be optimistic and I hope one day I'll be happy again lol
@FJM_TX im not even happy. I've got to be the most depressed, unhappy broken person ever lol
@FJM_TX why <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@FJM_TX ):
You don't drink poison and expect the other person to die
They don't care about you!!!
If you think that partying &amp; drinking &amp; hoeing around "will show them" &amp; hurt them, you're wrong. You only hurt yourself &amp; lose your worth
How could someone grow to hate me? Like did I hurt you that bad? Jeez
Problem solved, uhh, no.
Guys think it's so easy for us girls to sleep over, it's not. Lol
One day your ego and pride will get in the way of something good.
But overall it was a good movie <WHITE SMILING FACE> #leslierates10
I love love lol
If anyone watches a movie with me all they'll hear me going on is about the love. Im a sucker for love.
Lol this is why I have avoided movies for the past couple of weeks <WEARY FACE>
I mean yea it was cute, but when no one's loving you it kind of hurts
Actually throughout the movie. There was a lot of love being tossed around and it makes me sad that I don't have that anymore <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
The Avengers movie made me sad at the end lol
So as a person who's been there, I hate seeing others go through it. It breaks my heart <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm lucky I've always had someone to fall back on and even now that they're gone I can still count on a number of people
The suckiest feeling in the world is being alone
Like I don't care who you are. If you are hurting or in pain, I just want to hold them and tell them everything will be alright
If that makes sense
I can't stand knowing someone is hurting and not be able to do anything about it.
I know I'll be working but hopefully someone will tell me so I won't have to be all late on it lmao
Everyone's getting all excited so their feelings sort of stick to me
Genuinely excited to know who wins tomorrow lol
But then they gotta go and change on you out of nowhere. Like wth
Idc how young and stupid we were, I miss the old cheesy stuff
I crack myself up when I comment on Brian's posts. I'm so annoying <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@cheryblossommm same lol
Nothing says Arizona like a cactus does. (Other than the Grand Canyon) lol #GM 
Hadn't noticed that I work 11 hours tomorrow. <WEARY FACE>
Why do people have to be such grudge holders. It's annoying
When the courage you needed has been all but defeated in you, I'll do anything that I can do to show you my love and comfort you
You gotta live before you learn
Because we are damaged! Lol 
I wanted the truth, but sometimes the truth hurts.
It’s my fault, I don’t care, I can’t hate you if you’re not here. Once you go, never, ever turn around.
When I asked her if she loved me, she just smiled.
She said “Baby, it’s been real, but now I’m gone.” I should’ve known much better, you can’t tame something that wild
@Ogkillabitch it's called an alarm lol
I'm such a plain Jane based on looks but I swear I'm awesome lol
When I had no one to call, all the world had shut me down, I showed up at your door so blue. Thank god I had a friend like you
The girl you love has gone away, still too young to know her heart
They take advantage of your vulnerability and situation and that is not okay.
You never know someone's intentions nowadays
I honestly hope he's not getting a wrong message cause it ain't even like that
Only hate the road when you missing home
@Tanairim7 for real.I hate wanting to turn at a red light but can't because someone not turning is blocking the lane lol like why you there!
I'm alive but losing all my drive cause everything we've been through
Secondhand Serenade <OK HAND SIGN>
Goodbye, we're better off this way
@Tanairim7 lmao dumb lady. I hate drivers man
Trying to but it's so hard <DISAPPOINTED FACE>

@Tanairim7 @cassyy_baby lmao!!! Knowing you, I would believe if you had meant "also" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Omg YES!!!! It's so annoying when people don't signal 
Vianey just stepped on a lego lmao loser
I took a nap today so if I can't sleep I will have to be up all by myself <PENSIVE FACE>
Everything's so dead tonight
Lol 
I NEED to get my nails done <WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
Love him <RAISED FIST>
I have no idea where I would be without him rn, he's been keeping me sane through all this
After what feels like forever I spoke to Jose a little bit and it made me so happy to know I have friend who likes talking to me lmao
I'm such a girl <POUTING FACE>
2nd day of work &amp; I'm crying to my mom and sister about this random hungry man. Why did I have to be created with so many freaking feelings
Sam Smith is my go-to rn <TWO HEARTS> #gn
I wish you were still here... now more than ever <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
It made me so sad):
I had 10 dollars in my back pocket so I desperately wanted to buy something for him but I felt he might take it the wrong way
And I was busy so I couldn't do anything and the other girls didn't either so all he left with was rice
He was hungry and how could we not be nice enough to just give it away
It made me feel so helpless
And it was so sad that he didn't get the concept
Today a man came in and only had $4 and all he could afford was 1 thing
Seriously what is there to smile about
Today I was asked why I don't smile. Because life has sucked away all my reasons to smile!!!! &amp; BC I don't know you <WHITE SMILING FACE>
He's all that I want even though I can't have him.. but I guess I'm okay with that because he was like a drug, no good for me.
My day is starting at 4 and not ending until 12 tonight. Wish me luck <HOT BEVERAGE><SUN WITH FACE>
congratulations on your 3rd parent
@placidpandaa aww lol we could of started out together <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but anyway, good luck <WHITE SMILING FACE>
My cuticles are so dry #yuck
@placidpandaa lol which store did you say you were going to work at? Did you like it? Im still jealous, I wanted to work there <CRYING FACE>
@placidpandaa at quiktrip??lol
But then again I force myself not to think of anyone so I guess we're even <UNAMUSED FACE>
It kind of makes me feel a bit empty
It feels so weird knowing you're going to sleep with nobody thinking about you. Like you're not really special to anyone.
Blake is my babe
<UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
Ok jk
Ihy
Took my butt to bed instead
Mommabear tried telling me to do something useful if I'm not tired.. Ummm.. no. I am tired, do you not see these bags under my eyes woman
She probably has more of a life than me
Jk my mom is a busy woman <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I had asked for hers incase I need to call or something cause she's a mom and has no life, she doesn't even need it, but she always says no
But she doesn't really care cause she has sent me off into the world everyday for the past month without a cellular device
What of something happens to me and I can't communicate with my mother <PERSEVERING FACE>
I feel as if I'm in the 50's without my phone lol
Can't wait to fix my phone. Leaving the house without it makes me feel nakey
Honestly if I blocked you it's not even personal. I just don't need you snooping my stuff for other people
Idk what to do about the hundred dollars. If I have to give him back his change how am I supposed to give him 40 with nothing to show for it
But the thing is I never bought the shoes and now im down to $40 <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
I told my dad I needed shoes so he gave me a hundred dollars yesterday
Kind of sad that school is ending. I'll miss my table <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@smokeablezy24 lol! As if it were a relationship <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@smokeablezy24 lieessss lol how come?

@smokeablezy24 sike? Lol
But whatever, it sucks for those who have to listen to me <RELIEVED FACE>
Like why wasn't I blessed with an awesome voice?? I love singing <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
Listening to covers make me feel jealous
After the longest Sunday of my life I can now be snug in my bed <RELIEVED FACE>

@Tanairim7 I'm serious lmao
Like why do I get beat to all the good guys <UNAMUSED FACE>
If this guy turns out to be married ima be pissed
#smh <UNAMUSED FACE>
And the thing is these girls have the chance at having beauty and a great personality and they blow it
Especially girls with nasty attitudes. Will it kill you to care for someone other than yourself?
People think that being tough and strong means acting hard and "speaking your mind" when really, keeping quiet is the real challenge
@Tanairim7 not really. Doesnt mean I can have him <UNAMUSED FACE>
Met the man of my dreams today <RELIEVED FACE>

Everything that you've ever dreamed of disappearing when you wake up
"Free food-" Say no more.
My tweets are all out of order now lol
I want to say I didn't deserve it but then again, we deserve whatever we tolerate
But then again, I guess I did want the ending just not THIS way
And then again, didn't deserve what? It was great while it lasted
We were everything and beautiful, yet tragic.
@JCelis13 will you be here?
@JCelis13 I don't think anything why? :)
And so that's it. That's what happened
Smh. I don't care what it is that's a person ON THE GROUND. Where's your compassion you sour apple
And the man tried to see but the lady dismissed is by saying "it's probably a drug deal" like it was so common and she didnt even turn
And when I went to get this girl this older woman and man overheard
It made me so mad that they could careless if I watched or other people watched because they knew there was nothing I could do about it
And I know those men could see me watching them and seeing the whole thing cause the only thing between us was a fence
But what really got to me was how helpless the guy was.
I was shocked! How could people be so cruel. So I ran to get my sister and we ended up calling 911
When I turned back around to the men the guy was on the already on the ground and there were 3 other men standing over him
So I turned around and tried to get my sister's attention but she was obvi on her phone so she couldn't see
And I watched and I wanted to yell out for him to leave him alone but I'm just a girl :(
I saw this guy getting mugged behind a Little Caesars today and I couldn't believe I was seeing that
I ain't no angel, I never was, but I never hurt you
@JCelis13 -_-
Fake it until you become it
I want a hamster, but then I don't.

She's everything you ever wanted and everything I wasn't
You can't tell me that's not true
I would not trust a guy with looks. They're so superficial
Maybe it’s me and my blind optimism to blame or maybe it’s you and your sick need to give love then take it away.
They demand respect but won't respect themselves. Smh
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
Dear John I see it all now that you're gone
What version of you will I get on the phone tonight?
Why tuck in your shirt with denim jeans. That's so gross
Lol #true 
Someone should of slapped me
We were NEVER alike. 
We didn't even have anything in common. Wth were we thinking?????
I want the s6 edge :(
I'm so sore from yesterday
Seriously. My mind's being smart about stuff pero mi corazon wants to contradict and make me feel stuff <WEARY FACE> #whenwillitend
I have no idea why my heart wants to act up and be so stubborn today <UNAMUSED FACE>
The more you fall the more I feel bad for you
<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN> 
Precisely 
Fine, mom I'll make food, but you can bet IT WON'T be made with love
You told me not to cry when you were gone but the feeling's overwhelming it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side? Next to youuuuuuu.
And make sure you're alright? <MICROPHONE>
Nothing good can come out of that
Sometimes I catch myself still thinking about him.... so I stop. lol
@JCelis13 I know <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I think I'm falling in love with one direction
Wasn't tryna change him, only teach. Big diff
Im starving, will my mom feed me for once?
Fr  
Good thing I'm not seen any different only because our relationship failed. I heart them ♡
I love that it wasn't weird at all.

I seriously have to get serious about this homework
You might be with her but I still had ya first
And I hope you know that every time I don't, I almost do <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
And I just wanna tell you it takes everything in me not to call you
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
What a long daaaay

I might have knee probs <WORRIED FACE>
Leaving will hurt. But so does staying.
The pain that comes with walking away is inevitable so if it's something you're going to have to do sooner or later do it now.
Why is there not a bacon emoji
Either way I'm screwed <WEARY FACE>
Pero like if I don't sleep I'll be so tired later I won't even pay attention or do good anyway

Haven't seen my grandma in like 3 days. That party animal
I wish I was super knowledgeable about something.
@Phoenixaztec they're an amazing couple!! lol
It sucks so bad to know that someone you care for so much is going through a lot of pain and you can do diddly squat about it
Baby why'd you leave me? Why'd you have to go? I was counting on forever, now I'll never know <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>
I guess I should've been more like her
You love her and she loves you with all she has. I guess I should've been more like that
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at

Blake Griffin is ugly but I don't know why I think he's sexy lmao
If you know something a friend should know but it's not for you to tell them, would you tell them?
@smokeablezy24 or like Kid Cudi lmao
@smokeablezy24 lol! Smh. Young Wild and Free always gave that stoner vibe
@smokeablezy24 Because I got high lmao
@JCelis13 i hate when you say that lmao
@DanielBadass_ you know it's true
How shallow can you be
And if you say that's not true then I don't know what type of girls you be trying to get at and I would reconsider
Yeah looks are important &amp; it IS something we look at, especially at first, but if the personality is amazing then we'll overlook the looks
Alot of guys think that all girls care about are looks and honestly that is not true.
Why are boys such jerks
@DetectiveFM he kept saying he's not <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I have realized a lot of stuff tonight.
@DetectiveFM doesn't realize how drunk he is lmao

The way you lie.. it's what you do, it's who you are
You lie like the man with the slick back hair who sold me that Ford
Like if your relationship is so bad then get out of it. You weren't born together

There is honestly no excuse for cheating

Iced coffees are the best <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
@xojazmin13 no they're not! &amp; if they are then other's are being degraded just as much about other stuff as well. Don't single yourself out
@xojazmin13 tacos are cultural too you know. We don't trip when white washed restaurants want tocsee"profit" from our food
@xojazmin13 "wants to look like you"
@xojazmin13 I'm not going to read that. Other people can wear them too!!!! you should feel good that someone as pretty as Kylie
Nobody wants to comment on my taco comparison lmao
@xojazmin13 neither are dreads!
Chick got mad cause I said Kylie rocked dreads better <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Oh my lord.
@yoncesdrug yea what on chick just told me lol thanks
@Grandethebiebs yeah .. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Grandethebiebs not her fault she rocks it better....... lol and she never said it was her style. It was just a photo shoot
@Grandethebiebs Mexicans don't trip over people eating tacos
@Grandethebiebs okay good point then they should feel honored that Kylie loves their culture.
You don't see natural blondes tripping when a black girl goes blonde. Or gingers trip when others become redheads. They need just stop h8ing
I don't know why people hate on Kylie over the dreads in a PHOTO SHOOT. The "black community" doesn't own dreads.

If you say you want a muffin I'll give you this 
So in the end, I know I'm right and McMuffins are McMuffins, NOT muffins. There is no shortcut to it.
But no because a muffin is like a cupcake,  it's bread, not a breakfast sandwich.
Then she tried comparing them to Mcnuggets saying it's the McDonald's way of saying nuggets.
My sisters insisted they were called muffins but the wrapper and McDonald's calls them McMufffins
Had an argument this morning over whether egg mcmufffins were Mcmufffins or muffins.
But then again, common sense isn't so common anymore <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Some stuff should just be left private.
Bet they don't be acting that way in front of their dads.
And for girls, have some respect for yourself.
You're not funny!
I don't know why society leads you to believe that talking about sexual stuff will make you better and appealing and funny.
But we just can't be friends lol
