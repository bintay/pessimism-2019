Tories have 100 seats more than lab. Shows the biggest secret of the past 3 decades. England is a Tory (I think moderate fair Tory) nation.
Surprised £CTO is down today. Building services
Why did £BKG react quite so strongly this morning?
Sorry (well I am not actually) but I am glad to see the back of him. 
Garage beaten. Yes.
Might not like his politics but good to hear john Reid tell it the way it is rather than the way the socialists would like it to be
Poly Toynbee in denial as well.
Not at all. Enjoy the day off.  
Ken Livingstone is the most extraordinary man &amp; in complete denial. He can not come to terms that he lives in a right of center nation.
£BKG up 9%. Was on my @Stockopedia #stockranks screen but just did find time to deploy funds. Oh well.
£BDEV up 5%. Interesting.
@MBroomSmith: Balls just mentioned NHS. Maybe result proves that voters are not as obsessed with the NHS as the Labour Party think they are.
Nick Robinson. You are wrong. If he was such a great economist why does he promote the dreadful policies he does. I will always loathe him!
Yes yes yes yes yes. Balls loses seat  just made my year.
Recount going on at Ed Balls Morley &amp; Outwood seat. All fingers crossed.
Paddy Ashdown refuses to eat hat on BBC TV. Must be first time a politician has ever gone back on their word.
#redken what looney old man.
OMG Tories predicted to have 329 seats. Just brilliant. Finally a Tory government after 18 years. Now they can really sort the country out.
Ed Balls to lose seat? As Jean Luc Picard might say "please make so".
Can't say I'm sorry to see Cable go. Always thought he was a bit of prat.
Simon Hughes loses seat. Very sad to see him go. What a brutal game. Who would be a politician.
Take Scotland out of the frame and Cameron has walked it.  
Sorry I can't agree. Why a pathetic shambles? 
@MBroomSmith: I do enjoy watching Teresa May squirm! :-)
Guardian saying Milliband won't last beyond lunch. If Cameron gets 326 he might not get beyond breakfast!
Any guess on how much the FTSE pops at the open? Glad I stayed long but sorry I did not make time to invest some new money.
Ed Balls seat too close to call!  Happy days.
Elephant in the room here that is not being mentioned: Scots may have voted SNP but the rest of the UK have voted Tory. That pisses me off!
Gordon Brown's old seat and Danny Alexander's seat lost to SNP!!
Looking forward to seeing the pompous arse choking on it!  
Cons 316 Lab 239 SNP 58. I go to sleep in hope! Will I wake happy or in despair. At the moment I feel optimistic.
If I'm down &amp; FTSE is up &amp; vica versa I'm happy. Means I'm not a closet tracker. FTSE down today &amp; I'm up 1% so xtra happy. Sod the election

Another good read on Coho Capital.

Coho Capital end of year 2013 fascinating reading - 
L.XPP up 8% in two weeks. Where next? up above 1750? Core holding for me

@aceofwaste shows how little I know.
@Metier9 I would read the @GSpier book it is an easy well written read and full of gems. I intend to re-read after Security Analysis.
@aceofwaste yes but surely the Germans who have benefited most from the week Euro could clear the debt with only mild dyspepsia!
@Metier9 i will probably re read a second time and skim bits but probably deserves taking notes while reading like revising at school!
@Metier9 i am 25% of the way through and the app says 10 hours left in book! it is turgid in places and first quarter has been about bonds
@Metier9 god no it is on Kindle! Its is 6th ed. 1st ed hardback is $22k. Too rich 4 me blood same reason I can't get a copy of Casino Royale
Can somebody explain y as Greece repesents &lt;2% of EU GDP y everybody is getting there nickers in a twist.  does the EU not fix it &amp; move on
@Metier9 all the downloads are in breach of copyright.  Have not yet read the book but it is next after I have finished Security Analysis!
@Metier9 also I collect rare books, mainly Ian Fleming but also Harry Potter and the odd Investment book so I may keep it.  Pretty certain
@Metier9 I bought it of Amazon for £750.00. Perfect condition. I see it as worth it but also can re-sell at a profit so an investment but
