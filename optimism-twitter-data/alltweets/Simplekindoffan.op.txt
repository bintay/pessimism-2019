You down with TPP. YEAH YOU KNOW ME! 

Wait. What?

My bad, guys. #NaughtyByNature


We have have that one friend that babies their kid &amp; tells them how everything isn't their fault. How do those kids turn out? #America
The lesson never changes. If you're gonna take shrooms, do it in ur house w/ good music &amp; a cute girl. NOT by attacking cops. #tonyrobinson
@timcyoung Yep. It's a passionate topic when everyone brings their Gods to the fight.
The story of Harriet Tubman would not even be known if not for the actions of Andrew Jackson (and Stephen Girard).
A powerful religion is one that can detect &amp; eliminate offensive dreams. 
Made a consult appt for a vasectomy. I'm hoping they declare my balls to beautiful to maim.
@mizterfish Doesn't matter. All that matters is that Republicans are to blame for things they quite literally have had no part in creating.
Evil Republicans have created a racist system against black men via telekinesis,due to none being present FOR YEARS  
@Moneyman2626 @Barton1331 The guy took some shrooms and freaked out. It happens. It's a complicated term called: consequences.
This year, #Brewers start 12-21.
Hang in there, faithful! …
WHOA! This can happen? I thought the protesters would need SPACE TO DESTROY (and jobs)? 
Question answered. This makes much more sense. 
@redsteeze Any word of it the oppressed and jobless protesters have been given 'Space to destroy" by Commissioner Goodell?
At first I thought these guys were dumb, but I retract that sentiment. Mock away, Pats fan. This is pretty funny. 
@packerdan77 Standing by. Would suggest 'It Takes Two' by Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock for all 2 pt conversion attempts.
@packerdan77 This tweet won't be getting a favorite or a RT from Todd Rundgren anytime soon.
@czabe Come on, Czabe. Most people had their minds made up before the report even came out. The report is just kindling for the hot takes.
@bachlaw Cody Allen has been really bad too. I thought he was a lock for a step forward. Been anything but so far.
Pretty good tweet right here. 
@JessicaValenti Twitter isn't mad at you. They're mocking you. The fact that you can't make that distinction is perhaps even funnier.
Kid can't get the special education he needs, but a $2B business has willing participants ready to donate money. Staggering. And... #Merica
Best part of this? The lady commenting that she's trying to just raise $500 so her kid can get special education. 
@KCousineau09 I bet THIS INSTANT Brady has more in his wallet, in straight cash homey, than the funds raised.
@DruKure You haven't experienced true liberating feminism until you have your genital mutilated.
@DruKure The patriarch! You cannot even comprehend how awful women have it here in 3rd world America, THANKS TO YOU.
@DruKure Sorry to tell you this, but you are a sexist by today's definition. How hateful &amp; oppressive of you.
@AG_Conservative @RBPundit Wouldn't looking over someone's shoulder &amp; violating personal 'safe space'  be a triggering microaggression?
Depends on if the author is Karl Marx. 
*Walks into friend's study* 

Me: I notice there are no books here by (insert oppressed minority group)? Them: No
Me: YOU"RE A RACIST.
&amp; this little snowflake wants to check your book collection for a proper mix of female authors... to prevent sexism. 

Not following women: Passive Sexism

#CantWin
This little snowflake wants to turn who you follow into a sexism issue. Wonder where she got that reasoning from? 
@KristinaRibali @botticellicream You can't ask that! Next thing you know, we'll be asking how much is one's fair share. It's all abstract.
@JimmyPrinceton @AFP No way. It's going to be a bunch of work setting up. You want to be the 2nd guy to get the job, when the work is done.
Blaming Fox News for increasing poverty is like blaming your laundry detergent for an increasing pile of dirty clothes.
@themeiz I get that. I'm just pointing out what a loser strategy that is.
Forgot to mention, but you're no longer a coach with the team's respect if one of the players can disregard your last second play design.
That's why I like to have political debates in person. Where there is no Google. Just two brains full of useless stuff talking it out.
Looks like @itsCrab is getting a reaffirming lesson in Twitter. The google box has made everyone an expert at everything, except actual life
@JWuss Employers will sometimes pay for current education (my wife work pays 90% of her Alverno Grad school classes) but not for the past.
@donovanformayor Big youth support + the cow is out of the barn. The barn, symbolizing a failed Drug War, is up in flames (pun intended).
@donovanformayor As a good conservative in an urban environment, why on Earth would you pick this loser issue to stand firm? It has no legs.
@JWuss Why would they do that?
I bet it's been a busy two weeks for the Internet cul-de-sac housing Palindrome information.
The battle of the Mississippi River appears dire, at best. 
@GayPatriot It's weird. They remind me of mid 1990s Apple, in terms of nostalgic name recognition but have same demographic as CBS viewers.
@RobSchroeder12 That would include me as well. Can't say I've heard that point of view even close to a majority of the time though.
Lots of WI conservatives won't like that tweet, but it's the truth. Another GOP white guy will get slaughtered by the media in 18 months.
Coulter is far off the mark here. Walker is the ONE guy that can't win the general &amp; she wants Mittens to run again! 
Not identifying the race of a group of violent teens that hand out a vicious beatdown to an old man is a triggering microaggression for me.
Much like the media will only identify a politician in trouble if they are the GOP, when the race is left out, you know exactly the answer.
Hmmm. Lost of racial tensions in Baltimore. The information left out actually answers the lingering race questions. 
@IgnitorKid They're going to be fun once Luc gets back and Ramirez starts hitting in June, like every year it seems.
@brewerfan28 Haha. That made me laugh.
@IgnitorKid I think the same message can have a different effect, depending on who's speaking. But I'm a big believer in manager influence.
THOSE same ppl have been analyzing trade markets, rumors &amp; BS, while designing a rebuilding blueprint. Got to take them with a grain of salt
Lots of experts are going to tell you that hiring Counsell has nothing to do with the #brewers turnaround. Those ppl are, of course, wrong.
@WisconsinGunner I thought about going, but there just isn't enough value. Those summer weekends are like GOLD in Wisconsin.
@WisconsinGunner sorry, clarified.
@WisconsinGunner They would sell it out if the ceremony was outside versus a viewing party.
#Brewers only 5 games out of the WIldcard, winners of 8 out of 12 and owners of a 3 game winning streak. Lots to like in 8 days.
@ayygabbykayyy I don't think it's a waste of time. New England's abnormally low fumble numbers should prove that.
@TamraTellsIt A lot of people getting involved in the future of a business that they don't own. Can't imagine why the owners didn't show.
LRT: Yet, I think I'm going to stick around in the county for the coming water wars.
Milw Co. violent crime rate 925 per100K pop.

Wauk Co: 65/100K pop.

Ozaukee Co: 32/100K pop

Thats why people mo…
@JayWeber3 Wait, one of the reasons we're doing this is to remove a stigma? I have a stigma too, it's called taxes.
I'm no Doctor, but I believe I have come down with a nasty case of #brewers fever.
Your red hot Milwaukee #brewers. #WinningStreak.
Amazing play by Gomez to save the go ahead runs. What a game tonight. #brewers.
@DrewOlsonMKE You don't have to link the game. I was there, 17 rows behind the Brewers dugout. Sorry to bother you.
@DrewOlsonMKE If Kershaw can start a game that they win, no reason same thing tomorrow can't happen with Sale.
Boy, that Gomez HR right there could net Melvin another rookie ball prospect in a trade. #Derp #brewers
Much like rooting for your team to tank, it's a special kind of person that reacts to news of someone getting shot in the face with glee.
@mpbMKE Oh.... It's a goal number. Got it. Makes complete sense now. Good day to you, sir <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@mpbMKE I don't get it. Why does he need $37K? Didn't he just work THIRTY-SEVEN years? He doesn't have a retirement set aside by now?
@mpbMKE What happened to him? Didn't he just retire?
Bravo. Found a way around gun violence. RT @PeterNickeas: "Two pregnant females fighting, they have knives and bottles." #chicagoscanner
Can't we have a political debate on ONE single topic without someone relating one side to Hitler (usually incorrectly)?? Good grief.
No matter how long Brady got suspended/fined, people were going to bitch cuz they don't like Goodell &amp; can't possibly be objective.
@Jcollins205 @themeiz as I said earlier, that stink of losing permeates every nook, cranny &amp; corner in that clubhouse. Very hard to remove.
@themeiz @Jcollins205 It's the mob mentality, man.
@Jcollins205 @themeiz NICE! Hard to keep track since the discussion is on tearing it down and not riding out a rough 25 game patch.
Cheering for people that get shot is a new event in the Lowlife Olympics. 
Duh. Of course, Meiz is true blue. My apologies. 
@m_steven87 @johncardillo I'm guessing a job application frowns upon this new English as much as I do.
Here is a list of people that agree with me (that I'm aware of) that the #brewers are going to be just fine:
@WesHod Considering what McCarthy said about guys making the leap from year 1 to year 2, he must have plateaued, barring an injury.
Need some help from anyone fluent in illiteracy to help with a translation, please. 
Not going to defend Zimmerman this time, no matter what. Eventually, you just throw up your hands &amp; give up (like Dontre Hamilton's family).
The #BlackLivesMatter movement is like starting an anti-pollution movement called #BlueSkiesMatter, but aligned with top industry polluters.
One of the cops killed in Mississippi was black. But the #BlackLivesMatter twits don't care because there's no political capital to be made.
Obviously the fault of Scott Walker, in conjunction with law abiding conceal and carry citizens. AS ALWAYS. 
Take a number, moron. We'll call your number sometime next week.
The ex- Subway working Dum Dum that posted glee over cops being killed had to go to police &amp; file a harassment complaint. OK, that's good.
I don't have a dog in the fight, but the Catholic Church seems to be hastening their demise with this goofball Pope.
How many people are going to be killed? None, because the targets are rational thinkers living in 20th century. 
@sommersara28 Your FB got hacked, I think. I'd suggest changing your password from, HUSSY69.
These pics flooding @twitter of all of the brown lawns for Hollywood's elite is really hitting home on the seriousness of this water crisis.
Calling your political opposition 'racist' is ironic when participating in #VictimHarvesting on a daily basis.
This clown wants to control the language and the financial support of his political opposition, cuz he's tolerant. 
@RAYROBERT9 That was my point, People get enamored with the magic of baseball prospects that comes with a rebuild.
@RAYROBERT9 Always going to be exceptions, but vast majority of teams do themselves harm by tanking, let alone fans cheering for it in MAY.
@RAYROBERT9 But for every good example, there are 30 examples of teams that continue to stink, year after year.
@RAYROBERT9 I thought you'd go with Duncan here. What have Wall &amp; the Cleveland Lebron won by themselves?
@RAYROBERT9 That losing stink just doesn't fade or wash off. It permeates every corner of the franchise. It's more harmful than any top pick
I thought the "Thank You Veterans' stuff at Lambeau was pretty cool. Not nearly as cool now, knowing they got paid to do it.
If she wasn't wearing that Subway uniform, not a thing happens to her. If she was anonymous, nothing happens to her. That's the reality.
If you like to discuss politics, the Subway employee getting fired this weekend is reinforcement that it's pointless to use your real name.
Came across this tweet yesterday. Confirmed it's my co-worker. Small, small world. 
News flash, 1st Lady Dullard: Your hubby has been making it much worse for black people since showing up. Numbers don't lie, people do.
Is there footage of Nancy Reagan, The Bushs' or Hillary taking time from their FLOTUS day to piss &amp; moan about how awful the USA is?
@prosqtor I said 5-1/2 games, but it's really just a bunch of teams. Let's focus on Philly, Colorado and Atlanta this week.
@prosqtor They have 130 games left.... Anything can happen.
You have to be a special kind of fan to cheer for your team to tank. Cannot understand that mentality.
@LilMissRightie @Miss_Wisconsin It's almost as if someone would be an idiot to use their real name on here if they're raising a family...
@Miss_Wisconsin Free speech is protection from the government, not an employer.
@prosqtor Yep, got to find some way to get 2 against the Sox.
The #Brewers are only 5-1/2 games out of the 2nd wildcard &amp; closing fast.
That's a series win. Beat it, Cubs. #brewers
Was just going to type this. Smith is the guy we want right here. 
@KaraWitty 2nd degree sexual assault?
WOWSERS! Back to back. #brewers
Nothing says Happy Mother's Day like hiding in the basement all day watching baseball.
Crazy detail here on this site. Exit velocities on all 30 teams and then players. 
@MadMaxDownUnder Eh...I'd rather be where you are. Ah, to be young again. #ChasingDownUnderTrim
@MadMaxDownUnder My top 5 guys not Brewers I try to watch nightly: 1) Springer 2) Fernandez 3) Trout  4) Kershaw  5) Salazar
@MadMaxDownUnder He just threw to live hitting. I'm a Fernandez homer though, Love the guy.
@MadMaxDownUnder The other one was Miami to win it all at 40-1. We'll see. Last year I ended up a game 7 shy of cashing in on the Royals.
@MadMaxDownUnder My wife placed two bets for me while out in Vegas. Astros win the AL at 40-1 was one of them.
Astros have opened up a 6 game lead in the AL West! They have a lot of talent on the way too. Going to be good for a long stretch.
@Grungelady I can't think of one #blacklivesmatter shootings where the victim was innocent. That's the key. Not like say, Layla Peterson.
If I could see some kid in a Cubs jersey crying before this game is over, my night will be complete. #brewers
Yeah, I had a regrettable Davis/Seid tweet yesterday afternoon as well.  
#brewers hitting tonight like it's bar league softball. Blasting Cubs pitching.
7 year old is asking about the differences between their/there/they're. I guess she's ready for a Twitter account. Let a bully teach her.
Numbers don't lie, people do. 
I hit all winter with the HitTrax system and never even seen a 99. You can't appreciate how impressive this is.   
I'm guessing someone will suddenly have CTE when the cash runs out, which by the looks of it..... 
.@Jcollins205 Right? Who moves to Austin &amp; then complains about the BBQ smoke?? That's not assimilating to the local culture, AT ALL.
People are stupid. RT @radleybalko: Austin cracks down on barbecue. Puppies, pie, and orgasms probably next. 
Wife running her first 5K today. Blustery conditions for her three fans however.
Haven't the Milwaukee Hamiltons had their 15 minutes already?? The leaders that community selects sure are dubious, at best.
GoGo catches that ball. #brewers.
@Jcollins205 I stand corrected. That's smart. Always good to have options.
@Jcollins205 Not over!
Someone really should have a countdown clock started. 
@themeiz @NPetrashek I'm standing right here! No quit here.
Adam Lind's 40 time is calculated with a sundial. #brewers
@themeiz @MadMaxDownUnder @BrewersFanJP bars? Buy beer in bulk at home!!
@KevinNR I earned degrees in History &amp; Poly Sci. Your capital piece has me considering some points I'd considered settled science. Well done
@DanODradio @Miss_Wisconsin Snitches get stitches, yo.
The Cubs are going to catch a beatdown this weekend. You watch and see.
@CuffyMeh @AP Are the bases still enacting restrictions on guns? Cuz...
My grandma is just like my grandpa, except she doesn't have balls. 
@wallypingel Is that Crivitz?  Just to be safe, I'd recommend loading the shotgun and start shotgunning beers while you stand watch.
@wallypingel I'll guess Coyote? Or a killer black bear?
People that want equality want equality for all, not just their own particular sex or race. That's the utmost in sexism/racism!
These people don't want equality. Who doesn't like funny rape jokes. I'm betting this reject if they're about her. 
@timcyoung Yep. Behind the guise of it's good for Milwaukee. You know what would be good for Milwaukee? More cops.
@timcyoung Yep. I don't understand how any principled conservative would back this set up, that's guaranteed to cost Milwaukee $$.
@timcyoung I know. Just trying to show that mentality. Pouring money down the drain.
Haven't built the streetcar or operated under a budget but already seeking to expand it. What a complete farce &amp; you cons should be ashamed!
@BrianCarriveau When is this kid going to finally get healthy and get on the field? BUST!! Thanks a lot, Ted.
@bachlaw I'm a sucker for strong Belgian ales and that Raspberry looks good.
@brewerfan28 Done! Was wondering what kind of degenerate was running that Twitter handle :)
Here's your chance. Send me a tweet making your case for why I should follow you (if I don't already). Come strong, young grasshoppers.
@Amplexus4 BINGO!
Spotted Cow?  Gross. 
@Ryan_J_Lewis @AceofSpadesHQ It's not important whether it actually happened, but rather to bring awareness to dangers of threats to women.
Don't tell me what someone thought that lived (allegedly) 2000 yrs ago. We can't even agree what the 1st amendment says &amp; they wrote it down
Seems simple enough to prove. How about we ask him? Ask someone that knew him? Consult his memoirs? Private letters? 
Remember when some clueless government twit called ISIS the "JV"?
@Convertbond @VekTorBK Is full time considered 40 hours or 32?

2015: 121m
2007: 123m

Population +22m

BLS data
1. Have kids you can't afford without an active father. 2. Have a low amount of education. 3. Dig In! 
We got 93 millions American adults not working and everyday I am jealous more and more of these people. Who are the suckers in this system?
Simmons had the first blog I ever read with any sort of regularity.
@redsteeze LULZ:  'It’s one thing to bring an obscure, foreign astrophysicist to the point of tears over an insufficiently respectful shirt'
I agree with a great deal of this, but desiring Twitter to change, in order to conform to them isn't how life works. 
#FF @prosqtor @Steevo36 @JamieHundt @Barton1331  4 folks I enjoy interacting with on Twitter.
Co-worker discussing the Bears:  They'll come back. 
Me:  It's a dead heat between them and Jesus on who makes it back first.
@themeiz @NPetrashek IN THE AVEO?? He needs speed, not economy gas mileage.
@themeiz @NPetrashek Time to start chasing ambulances. "Petrashek Law Offices. You get hit, we take all of their shit."
@NPetrashek @themeiz Watching ball is getting stuff done. High priced lawyers like yourself have maids, butlers &amp; chauffeurs for the rest.
@ReedJohnsonFan What park did you play at?
You guys keep debating over estimates while I will be over here looking at the revised numbers.
I've never had any interest in British politics. But anytime a conservative wins, whether it be in England or Estonia, I'm pleased.
@KCousineau09 @RobDemovsky Was he signing babies or breasts?
@Barton1331 Green Bay would have 25 Super Bowl rings! &amp; how do you know Vince Lombardi didn't make this same deal in 1962?
@Barton1331 1000 out of 1000 times.
I find all of the liberal criticism of Ben Carson to be hateful racism. 

I can see why liberals like this strategy, it requires no thought.
@CCSO228 @BrewCrewCritic If they can get to 5 under .500 by the end of the month, they will be OK. Cubs are beatable 2 out of 3.
@BrewCrewCritic @CCSO228 Ha. Hopefully the young guys can get in by 5AM tonight so they can get some sleep. Really big series coming up.
@CCSO228 They got the split. Which against LA, in the Brewers swoon, is damn good.
Just don't ask Republicans to help out until it comes time to pay the bill. Which, oddly, is how this mess started. 
@ChuckCJohnson Is it possible to compare the graduation rates, reading proficiency &amp; teen pregnancy rates of this 16% to the other 84%?
Once the GOP gets to determine what's offensive, everyone will suddenly see the problem w/ letting political entities determine free speech.
All of these media ppl pretending like their views on free speech won't make a full 180 degree turn as soon as the GOP is running the DOJ.
Aren't the Dodgers aware of the mandatory contact play in effect at Miller Park?
@ReviewngTheBrew Nobody is getting traded...
Huh....

Top investigator in State's Attorney Freddie Gray probe tased by police in 2009 
@juliemsrd &amp; it's not my fault people that talk politics on Twitter should still to tweeting about belly button lint instead :)
@juliemsrd All we do here is talk politics. All day.
We had no volunteers for overtime today so the plant foreman had me pick a random number out of a hat and make a life enemy.
@FRHYSB YES IT'S TRUE!!
Sniff. The struggle is real. Poor guy. 
@Steevo36 Fo sho. I must spend 10 hrs/week trying to drive home how detrimental this type of stuff is. People only care about folks checks.
@Steevo36 Amazing to hear 50 yrs a week is unfair. But I'm not sure if he objects to the 50 hours part or the getting out of poverty part.
Good news for the #TwitterOnTheShitter crowd. 
This country needed Edward Snowden and it really really needs @PamelaGeller. 
@Barton1331 It was &amp; I did it for 6 yrs. But wasn't good to be gone for long tracts of time when starting a family &amp; getting married.
@TamraTellsIt Gotcha. That sucks. I don't think many people would threaten me. I am a big guy and I'm always loaded for bear :)
@AndyTarnoff You know me, I pretty much get along with everyone in person. I'm as people person as they get.
@TamraTellsIt Noted. I've never been threatened by anyone on Twitter but anti-gun people.
The term is now 'evolved'. It used to be called someone "full of shit". 
Despite the nonsense spewed today, poor people have to put in a lot of effort to be poor. It's a choice littered with terrible decisions.
Booker doesn't want to fix the problem, He want to prolong it so he can benefit both politically and financially. Why can't people see this?
But people like the inept Booker don't want people working 50 hrs a week. He wants them sitting at home, cashing checks and voting for him.
I got a sales job 15 yrs ago for an intl tour operator that allowed me to travel the world. I only got the interview because I had two jobs!
JFC. It's called a work ethic, you complete dullard. That's how people rise up from your war on poverty. 
@TamraTellsIt If only there was some political party not scared to offer a primary challenge to all conservatives that forget who they are.
@AndyTarnoff Dude, Begel was spot on today. Who is this replacement and WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH BEGEL???
I'd like to report an alien abduction of @onmilwaukee's Dave Begel! The imposter they left wrote a sensible article. 
@AndyTarnoff I thought we had settled on Tsarnoff? But to be fair, Tarnado is strong as well.
Except Ted Cruz. He isn't moving anywhere near the middle, and bless his heart for taking that stance.
All these guys/gals go out on their conservative branches of the tree and try new ideas, yet they all move to the middle the later it gets.
Disappointing ethanol comments from Carson today, but all that stuff gets cleared up in the general, which he has the best chance of winning
REHOR IS A HIPSTER!  
@WilkowMajority It's an investment in votes, not capital!
@Steevo36 The only reason I even trolled Mother's Day is to show how there are easy solutions to the problems we argue about daily.
@Steevo36 A private charity with 99% of proceeds going to feed kids could be quite effective instead of flowers, candy or other asst garbage
A #brewers win today and I'll likely cross that line from hopeful to cautious optimistic. They aren't dead yet, despite the rumors.
In a world where we were completely honest about everything, there wouldn't be glamour shots photo spreads for people that aren't glamorous.
@donovanformayor Shoot. There are some potholes so big on Morgan between 43rd and 68th that have their own eco-systems.
@sallykohn You should have tried growing up on a dairy farm. 2x a day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year. Or as we call it these days, privilege.
@MikeVassallo13 1B &amp; SS were big weaknesses last yr that are now strengths. Which I why they aren't done yet &amp; ppl are giving up too soon!
So many people hang their Seid hat on Davis as a starter for proof the team can draft talent.
Lots of talk about how Braun is tanking, AND RIGHTLY SO. But Krush sucks right now too &amp; can't play a lick of defense. #brewers
@Jcollins205 Holy crap. That sounds..... awful.
So I tweet that stuff about starving kids and Mother's Day and @CheCheeCheeChe follows me. I win. Sometimes, it's the little things.
@kvmcclean @NolteNC @mrgeology @anjemchoudary Nolte blocked me!  I've voted for Walker in Milw for yrs &amp; dared have an opinion. #PotKettle
@OtherJaymes You see those fumble numbers for NE in the last decade? I'd say it matters if you hardly ever fumble the ball.
&amp; that's my point. We argue ALL DAY over how to feed these ppl &amp; days like this we spend more than the problem. 
I heard this AM that Mother's Day cost $21B. How many poor, starving American children could be fed all year for that kind of money??
TBF, not really their fault they are no longer taught these things. RT @TamraTellsIt: Americans get an F in civics 
Well done, #brewers #untuckem
@IgnitorKid @AdamMcCalvy Is this whole thing just an elaborate ruse to sell hats?  Cuz... It worked on me.
@10iskristin those of us with wagers on the Astros would like you &amp; your curse to hit the bricks. <WAVING HAND SIGN>
I'm unclear on why anyone would be cheering the closing of Two Bucks in Milwaukee. Lost jobs &amp; Nate Hamilton mugging for the camera.
It's really more of a wheelshed. RT @bachlaw: Does Scooter have a wheelhouse?
Brewers taking Weiland out behind the woodshed. #brewers
@jrehor 1) make BB wear a suit for the rest of his career. 2) '16 Pats home games played in London. THAT is bringing down the ginger hammer!
Instead of a logical solution clearing up some of the mess in 20 years, the big idea is eating bugs to save us all. These idiots.
I know you guys don't like this idea, but banning organized religion would fix a large number of problems that world is having right now.
@Plouffe24Fan I have never heard of such a poll. Did they poll players that owe West money?
@Plouffe24Fan Two guys that think everyone came to see them.
Don't even get me started with umpire vs player policing! RT @Plouffe24Fan: @Simplekindoffan &amp; the warnings given lots of times after a HBP
If you want to watch a bunch of old guys hit that can't play defense &amp; don't run into walls, watch old timer softball.
Want to fix wall/player collisions? Don't have players run head first into a wall. Problem solved.
Why are people constantly trying to change the game of baseball? There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game (except the DH).
@WisconsinGunner @DerekOlson23 @RAYROBERT9 That's a good point. I haven't been an NBA fan (&amp; was HUGE) since the 2001 E Conf finals. #Fixed
@stephenkruiser I did the opposite and became well armed with lots of bullets. Rage away, idiots.
The good news on that silly survey is that Kim Kardashian was most different from me. Weird since we have the same sized ass.
Head, meet wall. My personality is 88% similar to Bill Maher's! #CelebMatch #IBMWatson 
There are no entities I trust less to give me the truth than the White House and the offices of the NFL.
Try this line of reasoning when pulled over for a DUI next time. He's the only one to get caught. 
@JayGlazer Wouldn't punishing New England by forcing them to play their 2016 home schedule in London fix two problems at once?
When you say you don't care about Tom Brady cheating, you are saying you tolerate cheating. Hopefully your spouse doesn't find this out.
@BillSimmons I think it's more like no one wants to ADMIT what happened. A team caught cheating a 2nd time is serious, let alone the champs.
Weird stat considering the extensive diversity in political parties these same cities feature. #FarmingPoorPeople 
@Sam_Kluender Fo sho!
@Sam_Kluender But psssst. By your mid 30s, nobody cares about the school on the resume, only that you have a degree. Experience is king.
@Sam_Kluender You know why they charge $41K to go there? BECAUSE THEY CAN AND PEOPLE WILL PAY.
I'll never let rich folks that fly private airplanes lecture me about global warm....errrr, climate change, without a fight. You guys first.
.@KofiAnnan Question: At the last Kofi Annan Foundation event, did you guys serve grasshoppers &amp; crickets or beef &amp; chicken?
The Patriots cheated. Again. Make them play all of their 2016 home games in London as a punishment.
@packerdan77 Just wait until they start passing trillion dollar laws without first reading them. Good times.
Let's take a step back from #DeflateGate and be just thankful that Tom Brady is white. Otherwise, race becomes the story.
I think I'll wait until Kofi has insects for a straight week first. But we all know Kofi means YOU, not HIM. 
@JohnEkdahl I think this has everything to do with identity politics and nothing to do with changing views on free speech.
@dj_gswizzle Sure is. The terrorists are now the good guys &amp; the police are now the bad guys. Yet who's 1st on the scene of a terror attack?
Simply Amazing. Can't imagine a 2% gap on a topic that couldn't be more clear.  
When some people write about Ryan Braun, they do so wearing a bib &amp; kneepads. Just don't get the need to defend the future $100M man.
Who wouldn't want their children to go to school with this guy? PLACE YOUR BETS! 

Father OR NO father at home? 


Reason? When they got rid of Republicans in Milwaukee, they also got rid of their programs. All that is left to cut is liberal giveaways.
Ever notice how the phrase, "Milwaukee needs _____" never discusses what current program to cut, in order to afford it? #BottomlessTaxBucket
@10iskristin The longer the NL sucks, the better the chances are Miami can make a run when Fernandez gets back.
Gee, it's almost as if some conservative entities are more interested in stoking controversies for page views than they are in winning.
We've got a great opportunity to educate young people on free speech &amp; The Constitution, yet we're distracted over Jade Helm 15?
@MadMaxDownUnder Using the Clarke example here in Milwaukee, I believe he mitigates independents.
@GayPatriot @RBPundit @gabrielmalor I like the description of the 'new normal', as if there aren't tools available to help spur growth.
Quite possible this 'article' whiffed on every paragraph regarding Carson's chances. 
@JayWeber3 I don't think we'll be able to fix this until residents recognize the characteristics their inner city shares with others.
@mpbMKE yeah, he was glacier-like.
@Jcollins205 Very good tweet, Master Collins.
Aramis Ramirez is officially on triple play watch. Was Henry Blanco slower than Aramis is right now? #brewers
@BigJoeBastardi Joe, it's been nice about 3 days all Spring here in Milwaukee. Living next to an open freezer will do that I guess.
@IgnitorKid @mpbMKE I believe JD hit one up there during his BP session a few years ago.
Drag a screen out there for Cotts before he gets hurt. #brewers
Major Leaguers don't miss that meatball served up by Cotts. #brewers
@Simplekindoffan or three even.
@JWuss yeah, the was a nice pivot after fielding to quickly get it in. Nice play.
No doubt the Dodgers want to get last night back. Two runs is probably not enough tonight. #brewers
Greinke looks like he needs a haircut and a week's worth of meals. Has he been locked in a cellar all Spring??
LRT: Now THAT is how you troll.
@ecwiscott smh. That is awful!
You see folks cry Cheney/Halliburton when discussing the Iraq War, but skim right over the same thing happening on many other battlefronts.
A whole lot of people make a whole lot of money battling the war on poverty. Don't ever forget that.
The same people that insist Hillary doesn't have to answer for Bill still require Rand Paul to answer for his father. Seems weird to me.
@WisconsinGunner Women aren't treated equally when considering domestic violence and sexual assault. EQUALITY FOR ALL.
Hold on a minute and let me see what Google says about that point. 

#WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough
I don't really understand the topic we're discussing. 

#WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough
I was wrong and you were right. #WordsThatDontGetUsedEnough
#Humblebrag I haven't gotten a favorited tweet since a midnight one in 2012. 
Even my tolerance of free speech ends when one slanders the good names of Ted Thompson and Craig Counsell!
When someone draws ire from both sides, USUALLY that means that the person is doing something right. I believe that is the case here.
I mean, I can't recall someone that draws more fury from people that spend all day obsessing over him. The GOP "pundits' are guilty too.
Don't like @ChuckCJohnson? I'd start by NOT mentioning him all day while writing countless blogs and articles about him.
I'd like to be the first to welcome our visitor from the planet Mars. 
@seoulcialite Are you truly seeking equal rights for all or fair treatment? There is a BIG difference between the two.
@10iskristin @Sam_Kluender Took the family &amp; went for the first time since Braun suspension. Twas wonderful to be back.
@10iskristin @Sam_Kluender I hope you have plans until Late October!
Muhammad cartoonists protected by Constitution are no more asking for it than a cute blonde with a short skirt is asking for it. Just stop!
@10iskristin @Sam_Kluender Going to be hard for any regular season games until September to top last night.
I guess I'll never get the Kentucky Derby dress code of shirts, ties and shorts. Seems like it should be described as Hillbilly Formal.
Spot on list. They're the worst. I'd say #5 is due to a shocking lack of education in schools. 
You try loving baseball, the Brewers, live 3 miles away, have lots of free tix &amp; a kid who has been begging to go. Had to be a Dad 1st.
ICYMI: Last night I sold out my principles &amp; attended the first Brewers game in 1-1/2 seasons. Free Box seats &amp; a begging kid did the trick.
If you've studied the GOP field &amp; conclude that old white #Huckabee is the best pathway to the White House, you need a lesson in reality.
Christians would get upset too if their religious deities were desecrated. 

You mean like Piss Christ? #NobodyDied  
I just wasn't hardwired to promote emotion based stories that put in the HERO that promotes them in a kind and caring light.
The local 9 are on a 3 game tear in early May and all anyone can talk about is trading everyone away. Good grief, people! #Brewers
@WinksThinks As tradition demands, Happy Cinco de Winko.
@BrianCarriveau Have you factored in Jesus Janis and his upcoming MVP season into the demise of Abby?
@AndyTarnoff Ha. Folks are getting on her for this being just a photo op. But I bet she played Tetris back then. Everyone did.
Cannot agree. Burning a flag, while disgusting, is ESSENTIAL in the concept of allowing ALL types of speech. 
Damn it. This changes EVERYTHING. 
@mcnetthj @KLNorvell @TheTopCynic @Erhine1 @SharpestJim @johnb631 @ter2459 @onejimharris I just know which ones WERE NOT targeted.
@mcnetthj @KLNorvell @TheTopCynic @Erhine1 @SharpestJim @johnb631 @ter2459 @onejimharris &amp; only certain businesses were burned down. #shady
@JP_Breen is it weird if Salazar makes my list? When he is on he's just so filthy.
@Sunbird5274 Ha!
@Sunbird5274 Anyway, I was looking forward to coming back to it &amp; it was gone. Sorry to hear about that stuff.
@Sunbird5274 Oh.. I must have missed that part? I saw one guy saying dumb stuff but that's par for the religious course.
@Sunbird5274 It's 1 of my favorite convos to have. I really like provocative topics like that. I learn something every time from good ones.
@Sunbird5274 What happened to that FB post? One of my 'Ah-Ha' moments in college was over free speech &amp; tolerance for things I/we hate.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I'm telling you, the weakest part of the lineup last year (SS &amp; 1B) are the best now. They're gonna come around &amp; get hot.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ He'll keep Herrerra off the field. They're gonna score some runs.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ get Scooter back now &amp; who knows. They win 30 of 50 sometime before September &amp; I think they're in the race.
And I completely forgot.... WINNING STREAK!! #brewers
There's not a lass in the land that could turn down Craig Counsell tonight.
A signature Craig Counsell win! #brewers
Been great. Now some KRod terror. RT @JWuss: Wow. @Simplekindoffan picked a heck of a game to attend. #Brewers
@mpbMKE I'm disappointed I blew that call. 
@mpbMKE I was just speaking naked eye. Was about 75 ft in front of me.
@Simplekindoffan idiot!
He was out. Easy call missed right there it appeared to me.
Kershaw is manufacturing lots of firewood tonight. #brewers
Damn. Braun now hovering around .220. Ugh. Got to cash in 3rd &amp; nobody out. #brewers
@themeiz could burn them off.
@IgnitorKid @Enrico_Palazzo_ it's all good. I'm playing 40 games this year myself so it's nice to sit back &amp; watch it again.
@brewfangrb @Enrico_Palazzo_ @IgnitorKid Shrug. Nice to be the Dad not taking something away for once.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @IgnitorKid I made it a year &amp; a half! Kid has been begging &amp; my company is giving me lots of games this year. Got to do it
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I kind of thought staying away for so long was a nice effort. I guess I'm just a sell out though <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@brewfangrb @Enrico_Palazzo_ @RDTopp I stayed away for 1-1/2 yrs. she has been BEGGING TO GO. They're the company seats so I took the family
Here's a shot of the Counsell after his first lineup submission. 
It appears that Kershaw is not getting paid by the hour tonight. He looks like he has 9:30 dinner plans.  #brewers.
@IgnitorKid these are the work tix tonight. Section 113 is sweet!
#FireCraigCounsell
They're showing all the Badgers highlights from the Final Four. Pretty cool stuff. #badgers.
Here. Plus, Badgers are here too. 
Just walked out of the house with the family. Let's see how long it takes to drive there &amp; get seated.
@evanwitsports Getting to the playoffs 2x in a small window is not really a problem. &amp; the system, while devoid of high end guys, is better.
@evanwitsports I think you have answered your own question about if they are hiring a new GM anytime soon.
Here they list the Astros as 9-1 odds to win AL. I got them 5 weeks ago at 40-1. That, my friends, is how you do it. 
@evanwitsports Maybe. He was already in the front office so the ties to Mark A make that difficult to envision.
@evanwitsports You want next year to already be a lame duck season?
@lachlan That would lessen the rush to be FIRST &amp; modern day media cannot have the race to be first integrated with facts.
Whoops. False alarm, I guess. Who would make this stuff up?  
Someone in Baltimore WAS NOT shot. I'll never be on the side of people upset no one was shot.
Over my busy weekend, I somehow missed that the #brewers released Jimenez. Surprised to see this move.
@JFMTheThird @mattyglesias I guess not caring for the approach one takes on Twitter &amp; being non-factual are two different things.
@mattyglesias I heard this from @ChuckCJohnson on the @joerogan podcast. It surprised me to hear &amp; was hoping you were familiar with data.
@mattyglesias Aren't there studies that show that people emigrating from high crime neighborhoods bring crime with them when moving?
@NPetrashek It's what my rankings are all about. 1. Carson 2. Cruz  3. Paul 4. Walker 5. Field. Top 3 each have a possible path to victory.
1. WIN
2. Nitpick candidate over views on marriage, trade or any other singular issue.
It's NOT about the issues this time. It's about who can win. GOP must get candidate in office that reverse all of the Exec order nonsense.
Look at everyone pretending that a single issue matters for the GOP candidate. We just had McCain &amp; Romney, bastions of conservatism. LULZ.
Man A: Dusty ruined careers with HUGE pitch counts.
Man B: A manager doesn't have an impact on wins &amp; losses.

Twist? They're the same guy!
I'm not religious, so I don't have a dog in the fight. But no objective person can say that Christians &amp; Muslims are treated equally in US.
@KrisLBurke Rolled my eyes when I saw that one too.
@Moneyman2626 Yep, celebrating by taking the family to the game tonight in the company box seats. Been a great day.
I support free speech, BUT  -  This phrase is a microaggression.
@ChuckCJohnson Chuck- enjoyed the #jre that I FINALLY finished. Be careful, folks that hated you before meeting you might change their minds
A Muhammad drawing contest is quite similar to flag burning. If you don't get that, you don't really get what free speech is about.
@DAinWIS @CarlyFiorina Name recognition is going to be a big problem for her. Nobody outside of us nerds knows who she is.
Who do you want fixing Obamacare? A doctor or a lawyer? Carson should use the approach taken by Ron Johnson here. 
A lot of people think Ben Carson cannot win. Those people are wrong.
@AnnLaabs I'm not willing to part with Melvin's mustache just yet.
@MadMaxDownUnder Yeah, it's personal emotions swaying how one feels versus being guided by their principles. You just try to reason w/ them.
In retrospect, Mark A should have cleaned house &amp; removed all traces of stink from last season from every corner &amp; crevice. #BREWERS
@umarsheikh95 @MadMaxDownUnder I appreciate your respectful discourse, which is rare on these topics. Good luck to you.
@umarsheikh95 @MadMaxDownUnder I agree 100%. We both have the right to express our opinions. It looks like we did find ONE reason whatsoever
This day just keeps getting better. I have the company seats tonight for the Counsell debut.
@umarsheikh95 @MadMaxDownUnder Similar to how non-Western countries treat women/ gays.Countries have to respect the rights &amp; views of others
@umarsheikh95 @MadMaxDownUnder Freedom of speech is a trait held in various forms by almost all Western Democracies.
I've got a reason, it's called the Constitution. 

"DUDE, RRR GOT FIRED! GET TO TWITTER NOW!!!"
@MadMaxDownUnder @Enrico_Palazzo_ Haha. Can &amp; will.
@MadMaxDownUnder @Enrico_Palazzo_ TAKE 1 GUESS!
Someone censor and jail this man for expressing his opinion on the freedom of speech.  
@mpbMKE Indeed. I know it's hard to be a running &amp; defensive type of team when your boss keep drafting bashers without positions.
So many have it wrong about a perceived minor impact managers have on overall wins and losses. Just got to shrug my shoulders on it.
All Craig Counsell has to do is correctly execute a double switch tonight and he will already be ahead of Roenicke after 1 career game.
While the RRR news is pleasing to my ears, @BadgerNoonan makes a good point about rejoicing in the loss of others. 
@IgnitorKid Really looking forward to seeing the bullpen setup.
If he could pull numbers similar to what Clarke pulls in Milw County, it would lessen the impact of independents.  
@juliemsrd They're going to catch fire, you'll see. They have all of the kindling dry and set for ignition.
Ron Roenicke. FIRED. Thank you to everyone who helped make this possible. What glorious news to greet me this lovely AM. #brewers
Easy win for Mayweather.
Look at Jimmy Kimmel's goofy ass.  Hilarious.
Here's the list of people I am scared to fight for $100 million:
"Falling asleep on the job is what it is" - Bill Schroeder  #brewers
WHOOOO! Hustle run for the #brewers
BTW, 3 Ted Thompson 6th round draft picks coming up. In other words, 2 starters and 1 Pro Bowler.
Jean Segura possesses the clutch gene. #brewers
I do not know a single person that wants Mayweather to win. Identify yourselves!
@timcyoung Always looking out, bro!
@timcyoung Yeah, I got a buddy that bought it. He lives in Tosa. Looking for a place?
Baseball team got pounded this AM. Then we hung around and drank 100 beers. Just got to make it to the fight tonight.
Up &amp; at 'em early. 9 AM games don't play themselves.
@Beltmaster guess not.
We spent a lot of resources on this pick and YOU WILL WATCH IT.
The TB pick has been in for quite some time. Thank heavens we let ESPN show their Gregory package they were sitting on.
@GayPatriot I said to myself, "Who the heck is Groan Walsh?" But really, deep down, I knew before I clicked.
@mpbMKE That was a pretty cool moment.
Well.... this is unfortunate. 
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @MadMaxDownUnder How many of these have to turn out to be be facts AFTER outrage before people learn?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @MadMaxDownUnder The point is that maybe people should wait for the facts before burning down and looting half the city.
@MadMaxDownUnder @Enrico_Palazzo_ Can't talk about that without first consulting Gray's severed spinal cord. lol.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ That's a pretty easy out right there.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Going to be hard to get that in a van as it is, but I'm talking about a 50/50 shot some folks feel pretty stupid.
Which of the six police officers was driving that van is now the entire crux of the story. Got to know that answer.
Notice anything weird about this photo? 
@FRHYSB Off to a 2x9 start with 2 walks. Not optimal.
@FRHYSB I wrapped it tight and played last night. It hurts &amp; my swing is quite hampered. Play tomorrow &amp; Sunday. If not better, get the MRI.
I found a spot to watch the fight and I'm going to be rooting for Mayweather (To be rendered unconscious).
@Beltmaster Going to this? 
@themeiz @Enrico_Palazzo_ You're probably better at running the bases too.
@AnnLaabs They are going to get hot &amp; not sell anyone. At least, that's what I expect ANY DAY NOW.
I expect more than 3 hits and zero runs, 
Another game with 3 hits. These guys couldn't score at a nymphomaniac convention. #brewers
@juliemsrd They're going to be holding you together with duct tape and bubble gum soon.
@juliemsrd Very nice. I don't mind the exercise personally. Used to take my brother &amp; I all day on the farm with a push mower.
@juliemsrd Riding lawnmower? Never owned one of those.  Having your privilege must be nice :)
Disaster for the citizens but a great deal for one political party. 
@WinksThinks Isn't that the guy that doesn't think he should be weighed down with academic concerns while a student-athlete?
@CurtLeCaptain @WisconsinGunner Despite our differences, it's nice to have a convo without: 1. disagree. 2. name call  3. block #Twitter101
@Beltmaster you working tomorrow? tomorrow night?
@WisconsinGunner @CurtLeCaptain . This concept of having most pay for some is why ppl do make big purchases out of Milw COunty. Like HOUSES.
@WisconsinGunner @CurtLeCaptain Credit cards? No thanks. &amp; again, it isn't about my money. It's the fallacy that all will share this burden.
@WisconsinGunner @CurtLeCaptain Yes Colin, I'm going to drive from Alverno out to New Berlin to do my grocery shopping....Quite the choice
@mizterfish We're talking about equality through a sales tax, which I'm pointing out isn't EQUAL at all. You are discussing FAIR. Not same.
Which is exactly why I keep saying that it targets only some taxpayers &amp; not ALL as it is being sold. 
@CurtLeCaptain @WisconsinGunner Please reads all three tweets and try to understand they bleed into one another. I know the difference.
@WisconsinGunner So you can pretend that the taxes are separate but they are not. It's simply a sneaky additional tax burden for half of us.
@WisconsinGunner  and which person is paying it out of taxpayer refund money?? It's all about who is ACTUALLY PAYING FOR IT? Not half of us.
@WisconsinGunner Wealthy Person B pays $3K &amp; gets back $500 (-$2500). Which person is paying the sales tax out of their own money? --2
@WisconsinGunner Let's try this.  Poor Person A pays $2K in payroll taxes &amp; gets back $4K in refunds (+$2000).   ---1
@WisconsinGunner Start taxing ALL government benefits received at 1% and it would be much more fair and cover ALL.
@WisconsinGunner It isn't about me, I can afford it. You see what I'm saying, right? This tax only targets those that actually pay taxes.
@WisconsinGunner It's another sneaky tax that appear to target ALL, but only targets some. You have to step back and see the big picture.
.@WisconsinGunner Everything! If someone gets back more tax money than they put in, who is TRULY paying that sales tax????? Not everyone!
That mentality is stepping over dollars to pick up pennies. They're so concerned about the small stuff they fail to see their city burning.
Urban residents will silently climb over a mountain of bodies due to gang violence in order to scream about 1 criminal killed by a white cop
*White cops* 
It's a terrible idea and one I vehemently oppose.
1% sales tax for the arena? You must mean for the people in Milwaukee County that actually end up paying taxes at the end of the year??
Imagine how folks would feel about equal pay if everyone brought home the same % of their paycheck. Let's be equal people!
You've heard how some neighborhoods in Baltimore have a lower life expectancy than North Korea. Imagine that stat if tracked at conception!
Always. They just have never had a forum to proudly display it before Twitter showed up. 
In terms of rioting and civil unrest.
Now we'll have to spend all day explaining the difference between being charged &amp; convicted. A non-conviction may be worse than a non-charge
The Federal Government? 
2 ppl shot &amp; killed at 37th &amp; Nash last night? THOSE Black Lives Don't Matter to the community though. No political points to score.
My waning interest in the NFL Draft is a direct result of just trusting Ted Thompson to do the right thing.
@RichardMChang I like him most of the time. Nobody's perfect but he offers a unique conservative perspective. Our little Chang, ALL GROWN UP
--Larry Elder 
Exactly. When we say, "I told you so", it's then derided as taking joy in the suffering of others. #ReapWhatYouSow 
@MacIverWisc I'd say no. Earning a salary after being elected is QUITE different than being given given something that wasn't earned.
29 moves outside so a S/CB in the slot works. OK... Who called this pick out there pre-draft? #packers
@JDubsGman @TamraTellsIt @Bobacheck that's a good example. Why aren't more like him, just lining up get paid?
@Bobacheck @TamraTellsIt I've always said that if arenas/stadiums were $$ makers, the owners would build it themselves &amp; RAKE in the dough.
To be fair, both do have similar styles of government. 
@hbryant42 @NFLOwnerGBP It's more of a "Would You Rather". Would you rather see a parent STOP violence or watch a senior center burn down?
If anything, Ferguson &amp; Baltimore have helped me focus on where my entertainment $s are spent &amp; more importantly WHERE THEY ARE NOT.
@mzappitello Can't agree there. And the bar for 'incredible' has been set so low that now walking out to the mailbox constitutes drive.
@mzappitello @colleencpa Why should someone make it without showing incredible drive/will?? Those characteristics determine winners/losers!
Customer:  I really need this stuff right away and I'm desperate.

Me: *Adds 12% 'desperation' fee to the quote*
I'd like to know when @DanJoseph78 adds a video, but there isn't any obvious ways to find out...
@juliemsrd Setting up a nude sunbathing area instead??
Mr. President, you have a phone call. It's the 80's on line 1. 
@thor_benson 
@tnr
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Nah. You just want equality for women, right up until we start treating men &amp; women EXACTLY equal.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ But that would never happen because one party makes a killing off of the emotional weaknesses of gullible single women.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Sure, which brings me to MY POINT. Pay that $360 &amp; then take away all of the women centric aid programs that men don't get.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ But I must admit, I am not familiar with pay gaps in the very very specific field of corporate CEOs.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ The BLS reported that single women who have never married earned 96% of men’s earnings in 2012. The gap appears with kids.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Haven't talked about dangerous jobs, construction &amp; other men related fields that pay big $ for long hrs, physical exertion
@Enrico_Palazzo_ So we agree that the stat is misleading. If a woman takes 5 yrs off, does she step in &amp; make what a man currently makes?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ So essentially, 1 person added to the number of women, $0 added to the salary column. Imagine how that stats skews things.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ A lot more than that buddy. Your wife's last few work yrs are included in these women's earnings. Doesn't account for kids
If we treated everyone EQUALLY, men and women would get the same amount of maternity leave. The same birth control. The same everything.
Fair can be subjective &amp; lead to subjective accusations. Equal means no exceptions. No special treatment. NO CONTEXT. Subtle difference.
What we want is emotional reassurance that we're treating all 'fairly'. Fairly is different than equal &amp; can be interpreted. Equal cannot.
Society doesn't TRULY want men &amp; women to be treated equally. Example A: Different admittance standards for military men &amp; women.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ You ever took the time to investigate how that stat is determined?
We could dig into the wage gap theory &amp; analyze how that is determined, but no one here is interested in finding the truth. #VictimOutrage
@Enrico_Palazzo_ How so? Isn't all of the income government provides to women supposed to help level the playing field?
If the alleged wage gap between men &amp; women was completely closed, we'd be sure to expect women to pay for their own birth control, right?
I've got a giant knot in my bicep and it has my arm in a weird shape. Hopefully it's just a pull.
@TIME You'd think after ALL of that time, compassionate Democrats would've gotten around to helping the community instead of organizing it.
Ppl upset about this? He just works in Baltimore. Not his fault they're so disheveled they can't have fans at game. 
@dwalsh76 @klwillis45 @WinksThinks @JP_Breen I thought those were part of the schtick? They were so prevalent....
@WinksThinks @dwalsh76 @JP_Breen Smart-assed readers too?
@themeiz haha. Yeah. Saw this. Nobody home but me this weekend. May have to stop out at the crater.
Someone I know (me) has them at 40-1 to win the AL. In. 2015. RT @JP_Breen: It. Is. Not. 2017. Yet. 
@MadMaxDownUnder Been bashing that for 24 hrs. It exposed so many as true hypocrites. 'Twas delicious. And sad to see it have to play out.
@MadMaxDownUnder Can't do that in a political family during a primary cattle call. Well, unless you're a Clinton. They can do as they wish.
@MadMaxDownUnder Agreed on youth reach. But World's Greatest Dad could have a kid with a DUI.
@Sam_Kluender I've been doing them for a few months. I usually RT a tweet like yours after explaining to anyone who doesn't know.
@MadMaxDownUnder Yep, I like him a lot too. Appeals to independents &amp; will get base to turn out, unlike the last 2 bozos. Including me in 08
@Sam_Kluender Who do I think will win? No idea. So hard to say.
Those ranking are my personal preferences &amp; electability. RT @Sam_Kluender: @Simplekindoffan Is this your liking or who you think will win?
@MadMaxDownUnder I am operating under the assumption that he is running.
Are we really looking to Hillary for Baltimore solutions? She couldn't find her ass with both hands unless it was composed of political hay.
@GopherBrokeBaby Sounds an awful lot like what I've been preaching for years on here. Good for her to have the courage to stand up.
My personal End of April GOP Standings:  1) Carson 2) Cruz 3) Paul 4) Walker 5) Field.
That video sums up the TRUE racism that terrorizes the inner cities of America, thanks to one political party in control. #ClosetRacists
This lady is asking that everyone be treated the same. Where have you heard that before? (h/t: @GopherBrokeBaby)


@GopherBrokeBaby Got to watch that later. I don't generally do videos at work.
@IgnitorKid  Fo sho. Mass area code.
@GopherBrokeBaby I'll check it out. Thanks.
@GopherBrokeBaby I have not. Got a link? I'd share it if good.
How long before we start to look at the ascension of "community organizers" while the ascension of their community is static, at best?
.@GopherBrokeBaby He is great and drives folks on the East Side/Bay View straight loco. Plus, he carries the black city vote quite handily.
If you DON'T want to be the next #FreddieGray, allow me to give you a 2 step solution:

1) Don't break the law. 
2) Don't run from police.
@JP_Breen The lack of heckling over his mullet must be getting to him.
1200 ppl without jobs because a bunch of uneducated losers believed the govt when they said, "free" healthcare. 1200 lost jobs isn't free.
@themeiz @dominicnanni Very good, Meiz. I was hoping a few would reach that conclusion without me having to type it for them.
1200 jobs Milwaukee is NEVER getting back. Better raise the wage to $15 to attract more businesses. IDIOTS.  
@JoshHunt77 If it makes you feel better, when you point out when you're right, either you got lucky, you're a braggart or no one cares.
Cedarburg High School has a sports management class &amp; 20 miles south, more than half the kids can't even read. Which town are you picking?
@JoshHunt77 Props for owning up. Rare around here.
About as good as Twitter gets the last two days. What a bunch of qualifying, excuse making and contorting.  


We have a STRONG contender for the idiot of the day. A Grad student... Better brush on the political scale, buddy.  
This last sentence is probably the closest to truth you will read today about Baltimore. 
@AIIAmericanGirI @LizSchmidt3 Question: Why do police in rural communities not have the need for body cameras?
The guy leading the team isn't getting his message through. They are flatlining. #FireRonRoenicke
LRT: The THUG talk backpedaling is important given the outrage over that word in the black community over the last 15 months. #HYPOCRITES
@chelsea_elisa @botticellicream @Salon They mock "you're not the boss of me" while embracing the concept "you provide everything for me".
HUH. Looks like the terrorists win their 448th consecutive round. 
@FoxHillsResort I mean, they had 100s of people there &amp; some didn't even get food! But the worst is your lack of response to obvious issues
@FoxHillsResort  the worst I've had at a wedding. It was cold but at least I got some &amp; not sick. You guys should be ashamed of your efforts
@FoxHillsResort I grew in Mishicot &amp; have always respected Fox Hills. I went to a wedding there this weekend (Kudick). The food was  1/2
@ThadCollins Cuz I like you personally, I thought it best to just block &amp; not say those things, but you asked for it. #GoodLuckToYou
The hypocrite making the distinction between these two people is the real problem in this country.
President Obama, with a history of homophobia as being against gay marriage a few years ago, called Baltimore rioters THUGS. #NeedContext
President Bush, with a history of homophobia as being against gay marriage a few years ago, called Baltimore rioters THUGS. #HatefulRacist
Letting these ppl get away with this tactic is not something I'll tolerate while having a Twitter account. It's so OBVIOUS if you're looking
In essence, they have to use their personal politics to contort their viewpoints, in order to make what they were against-  OK THIS TIME.
And that basic tweet is why folks like Richard Sherman got nothing to say today about the word THUG this week.
Just treat everyone the same. No matter what. No qualifying, no priviledge. No excuses. Why is that so hard for those that preach tolerance?
@MiltownBucky @ThadCollins shit fit over hate and bigotry. But you won't BECAUSE YOU'RE BOTH GRADE A HYPOCRITES. -4
@MiltownBucky @ThadCollins If Bush was an outed homophobe 3 yrs ago like Obama AND called those kids thugs, you'd both have a... -3
@MiltownBucky @ThadCollins This opinion is a joke, as is your two viewpoints on race and tolerance in this country. JOKES. -2
@MiltownBucky @ThadCollins Have you done enough backbends, qualifying, bullshit &amp; cowardice analysis yet, Will? -1
Just wait until the 0.2% is adjusted!
@mpbMKE @Enrico_Palazzo_ Sounds like a sales pitch I was giving at 2AM in Whitewater.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ gotcha. Yeah, I'm almost always underwhelmed when I read them.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ See, I thought that Angels blogger did just that.
@ThadCollins @MiltownBucky How so? Treating everyone the same is a main theme of my twitter acct/blogging stuff.
Going back to last season, the #brewers are 15-42 in their last 57 gms (.263). Extrapolated over 162 gms, that's 42 wins!! #FireRonRoenicke
The team is 4-17. I have no idea what Mark Attanasio is waiting for but clearly the Roenicke era has flatlined. #FireRonRoenicke
"Riot-shaming". LMAO. The struggle is real, people.
@ThadCollins @MiltownBucky Context requires interpretation, which leads to different viewpoints, ONE standard eliminates interpretation.
@ThadCollins @MiltownBucky &amp; what is Sherman doing this week? Selling bracelets &amp; keeping his trap shut. I guess THUG is OK to say this week
@ThadCollins @MiltownBucky All I want is all speech to be equal, you guys want to qualify it based on the race of the speaker. DEAD WRONG.
@ThadCollins @MiltownBucky MLK rolling in his grave as you 2 educated knuckleheads continue to consider the race of the speaker FIRST.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @timcyoung Stevie Wonder.
@Schneider_CM The City of Speeches.
Geraldo getting swarmed was exciting TV.
10 minutes to showtime!
@Enrico_Palazzo_ tidy one tonight
@prosqtor indeed. Not looking good. But it's a long season. I'd settle for 10 right now.
4-17 is deeply troubling. #brewers
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @mpbMKE But man oh man he eviscerated Hamilton. Ruthlessly. A very small part of me liked the guts it took to write it.
3 hits... #brewers
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @mpbMKE I thought that sounds about right since he was still riding Donnie Moore.
@10iskristin No.
@Barton1331 I just think everyone should always be treated the same, regardless of race, creed or sexual preference. Hard for some to do.
@Barton1331 Seems similar to Deadspins' Magary football previews where he shreds players &amp; orgs is offensive too but nobody cares cuz HAHA.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ He didn't cross the line for me, personally. But in the PC society of the perpetually offended, he did. #KnowYourReaders
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Bad for life &amp; marriages, but good if you can keep it together long enough to get PAID.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Ever think that the drugs were the one thing in his life that made playing baseball easier while dulling everything else?
@mpbMKE @Enrico_Palazzo_ I always side on the truth when opposed by tact/good taste. But it wasn't my job up for grabs &amp; I'd never blog that
@Barton1331 
@Enrico_Palazzo_ but any business can fire anyone they please at anytime. Well, except shitty teachers.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Better isn't factual. He's telling the truth, based on countless examples of destructive behavior from addicts.
@JessicaFastball Whole Foods donating food to troops in Baltimore. Residents with kids home today (without free lunch) upset.
@AndyTarnoff As I said, based on my past experience with those words in the past two years, he was totes racist.
To me, the biggest worry tonight in Baltimore is further home invasions. Someone is going to get shot forcing their way into the wrong house
@Barton1331 @RobSchroeder12 Good job using your brains, boys. But that's the message today. Anti-riot is bigotry. #ChickenLittlePolitics
I guess the Angels blogger will have to be the bad guy until his words become reality. Of course, it's never about right &amp; wrong afterwards.
You know what will fix Baltimore? Bringing in a bunch of amnesty immigrants to compete for what jobs are still left in inner-city Baltimore.
Thugs and Criminals, yo.
@dj_gswizzle Because of the only other things to look at are destruction, failed policies and a lack of Republicans.
And if it does, the most ill-prepared "Americans" will the the anti-gun crowd. Food first, security second. 
Code= Approval or rejection of certain types of identical speech based ONLY on the race of the speaker. MLK would reject this theory.
Here is someone with his own "code". What could go wrong using this logic??

I guess we should find out if orgs like Salon have the same tolerance for destroying property when it's theirs. HINT: THEY DON'T.
@ReviewngTheBrew @JRRadcliffe But yeah. his last 9 gms before injury: 21x31, 5HRs, 15 RBI, 5 walks. Still got the memory, I guess.
@ReviewngTheBrew @JRRadcliffe Never saw a hotter Brewers players outside of a guy named Molitor in the 82 Series.
@AndyTarnoff And that is awfully presumptuous to assume given the President's bigoted &amp; hateful position on Same Sex Marriage 3 years ago!!!
@AndyTarnoff You THINK. Just like you THINK the same word means something completely different for a different speaker. Can't you see that?
@JRRadcliffe @ReviewngTheBrew Wasn't Jenkins absolutely RED HOT and then got hurt a day or two later?
And we haven't even talked about how future rioting in Milwaukee over the next couple of months may kill the statewide arena funding push.
I'd equate my emotion today on par with answering 2+2= 4. But being told for five years the answer was 5.
I spend 5 years decrying urban politics/speech hypocrisy &amp; then when it all goes down, I'm accused of taking joy.
@AndyTarnoff You should take that back, take a deep breath and try again. Outrageous accusation.
@AndyTarnoff &amp; this is why you take personal politics out of speech &amp; make it 1 policy for all speakers, regardless of the speaker's race.
@AndyTarnoff Cuz I'm betting someone in Bay View/East Side has a different view on coded language than someone from elsewhere in the state.
@AndyTarnoff NO. Really, how do we decide which speech is code, like racist Tea Partiers, &amp; which is honest to goodness talk, like Obama???
@JWuss I have white spray paint at home. I am seriously considering doing this. This thing could swallow a Volvo.
You can't have two guys say the EXACT SAME THING and only condemn one for racism. Well, not in a just society devoid of political gain.
@AndyTarnoff I know for a fact you're a smart guy. But this take? No way, Jose. Sanctimonious? Obama used ' racist Tea Party rhetoric' today
How do we decide the 'code' is offensive? By taking into account the race of the speaker?????????????????????????
@DerekOlson23 He's practically a GOD in the Packers liberal Twitter circle. What a bunch of zeros that group of losers turned out to be.
EXAMPLE A of why these urban areas are not getting better anytime soon. Poor history ignorant Julio. 
I had a ton of convos about the word thug just being a word like any other. Those guys are REAL quiet today. Real quiet.
This weekend I'm going to hike the pothole I pass each day to/from work. It appears to be so deep that it has its own ecosystem.
You people with the guts &amp; character not to mute me KNOW THAT TODAY IS A CROWNING MOMENT FOR MY TWITTER ACCOUNT. #ThanksObama
Once again, we're taking into account the race of the speaker when determining if speech is racist. How convenient.
I could hammer that "Thug is racist" nonsense into the ground today, but why? Those folks are HYPOCRITES as of April 28, 2015.
I wonder what @RSherman_25 thinks about President Obama describing Baltimore rioters as thugs &amp; criminals. He USED to think that was racist.
@WisconsinGunner @KCousineau09 My thoughts would be to have an area that could be used for gamedays. Can't wait to dine at 1919 though,
@WisconsinGunner @KCousineau09 Both. Bar was 5 deep. Was like cramming 15 people into a Yugo.
@KCousineau09 @WisconsinGunner Especially when I considered it to be about even with Culvers but much more expensive.
@KCousineau09 @WisconsinGunner I went there for a gameday bright and early and it was soooo busy, it made me not want to come back.
In reality, community organizers should be walking around with giant mirrors so people can look and assign proper blame.
Groups of people think they're entitled to things others possess and their lot in life isn't their fault when organized as a community.
It's all about want vs need. All about blaming someone else for your choices. THAT is what community organizing is all about.
That's the reality of being poor. One's choices make up their reality. Blaming someone else for your choices is never going to end well.
You're at the point of needing help when you have nothing else to give up before requiring charity of others. Anything else is WANT not NEED
Smart phones with any type of data is EXPENSIVE every month. It would seem people aren't forced to choose between eating, shelter &amp; phones.
A question no one is asking is if Baltimore is so poor, where are all of the smart phones used for recording coming from?
LRT: Look at all of those government programs and half of the ppl in Gray's neighborhnood don't have a job. More govt is not the solution!!
@MadMaxDownUnder Both, but only if they do not know me. Facebook is a good spot for that. I've been censored by FB numerous times.
@MadMaxDownUnder @dj_gswizzle  It's frustrating. The only solution that will work is personal responsibility. That is deemed racist.
@MadMaxDownUnder @dj_gswizzle I get called a racist weekly. When I point out the best man is black, I get the "I have a black friend" line.
@dj_gswizzle @MadMaxDownUnder Almost all themese for those in attendance were a smaller government, less entitlements and a balanced budget
@dj_gswizzle @MadMaxDownUnder I do not tolerate racism in speech or action. I have never heard even an utterance of racism at events.
But to be fair, today that threesome is considered to be an Uncle Tom, a racist and a sell out.
Sure. Lots of women too. I saw Herman Cain, Breitbart and @VickiMcKenna all speak at a Madison event years ago. 
I've been to a lot of Tea Party rallies and the exact count of bricks being thrown by attendees and security: ZERO.
Naturally. Noticed we was set to block those of differing opinions as well. In the name of tolerance. 
And when the GOP resists increasing aid to these areas, they'll be branded a bunch of racist Teabaggers that hate black people.
Now that the destruction has taken place, it's time to finally bring the GOP into the discussion.  For financing the costly rebuild.
@themeiz @timcyoung where there's smoke.
@WinksThinks I can't believe how bad the pitching has been.
@WinksThinks I would have cared. Greatly. Season is tearing me up.
Y'all gonna want to check out this hashtag. Insanity. #baltimorelootcrew
@AndyTarnoff Please. There are tons of legitimate objections.  &amp; not too many ppl up north seem to like the idea either.
Braun breaks my heart. For like the 292nd time. Nice to see them no just roll over tonight. #brewers
It took a 1/2 hr to catch up, but I did not want to miss any tweets tonight. Crazy night. Stupid #Brewers are cratering as well.
@mpbMKE I thought so. It's cool. It's so damn sad to see this happen. Hopefully no one is killed.
@mpbMKE One way to prevent is to not let your mentally ill brother live homeless on the streets &amp; suddenly care afterwards with TV cameras.
@MadMaxDownUnder @Enrico_Palazzo_ I'm operating under the assumption that he is.
@mpbMKE You mean like having Republicans be part of the discussion, or just the inevitable financial decision?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ what did you want to see done? Non consent lockups of the mentally ill? Ban guns?
@MadMaxDownUnder @Enrico_Palazzo_ nah. The problem in big cities is Democrats.
@mpbMKE But a hose is what I would do. Just like I would personally defend my business against looting &amp; my property from destruction.
@mpbMKE INDEED! These ppl don't realize that the solution will be more government.
@timcyoung Yes, I know.
@mpbMKE perhaps you would have been happier with some established zones of destruction?
@mpbMKE Should have blown those losers off the freeway with a fire hose too.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ No one cared about that? Are you sober?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ yeah &amp; 10 black kids are gonna be killed in the next month &amp; nobody gives a shit about that.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @sallykohn That's unacceptable too. But tolerance of destroying businesses &amp; property is never the BUT.
There is never a 'but' after those 4 words. RT @sallykohn: Looting a real shame. But....
@GopherBrokeBaby Nah, man. Best man in my wedding is black. I don't tolerate that kind of stuff.
@getacoop Beautiful.
Still leads the league in confidence. #Artist RT @getacoop: How many more years of Braun's diva act do Brewers fans have to put up with?
@redsteeze Quality work today on a variety of topics. #props
@FRHYSB A very, very, very, very, very well paid bum. Most expensive parts aren't for years yet.
If you live in an urban area of this country and you aren't armed to the teeth to protect your family, you are asking for trouble.
As we all know, those Baltimore kids aren't going to give up those corners without a massive fight. #TheWire
It would seem that Maryland could use a well regulated and armed militia. I bet that would clean the streets up pretty darn quick.

@Miss_Wisconsin To look at animals native Africans haven't yet poached into extinction?
What Baltimore needs is a VERY large broom and dustpan.
So... safe zones for rioting but none for gun ownership, according to the left.
@SooperMexican WHOA! A side arm delivery like that can be valuable if he can control his offspeed offerings.
Braun has to be hurt. Because if Logan Schafer is a better option, it's time to hang them up.
No Braun in the lineup again? What a terrible contract he owns.
@botticellicream Yep, always a good day when that happens.
@botticellicream Good job making Twitchy.
@FRHYSB Yeah. I'm concerned.
I'm not sure if I have a biceps tear or pull or strain, but I have bruising, a weird bulging of the muscle and some decent pain.

The gay guy apologized, that is.
Blaming Republicans for rioting in Baltimore is like blaming Jenny Craig for your fat ass.
VOTERS: 
Oh, whoops! My bad guys, apparently they already did that 50 years ago.
What Baltimore needs to do is get rid of all the Republicans in city government that are oppressing minorities &amp; making the problems worse.
Folks act like injuries are financially devastating to clubs. Here's a list of teams that do not insure long term contracts:
It is NEVER time for the DH in the NL. Might as well drag out a screen and make them throw underhanded.

@JamieHundt Thx for the RTs and Favs. I appreciate it!
Me: That was in Nepal.
CW: Where's that?
Me: The Himalayas.
CW: Where's that?
Me: Between India &amp; China. 
CW: Oh....
Co-worker was just telling me about the devastating earthquake this weekend in Naples, Italy.....
Fo sho. They have some blame as well. Lots of chefs have helped bake this awful cake. 
The Brewers don't want people sitting at home giving their $ to MLB via the internet. They want you spending that cheddar in house.
Ppl criticize MLB for their blackout policy &amp; rightly so. But they completely overlook the influence individual clubs have on the process.
@Beltmaster Let me talk to Lisa about that. I'll holla back.
That's a mediocre AAA lineup, let alone the big club. Goodness Gracious.
@LizSchmidt3 Not criminal for everyone. Just those HE disagrees with. Funny how that works. #Brownshirts
I'm so hungover it hurts to blink.
Currently watching my 3 yr old BRING IT on the dance floor of this wedding to Uptown Funk. Straight dealing.

@AdamMcCalvy Good a night as any, I suppose, to pick that Game 6 scab off.
Bruce Jenner went from being perceived as brave and heroic by the left to traitorous in record time this evening.
Uh Oh, they got something brewing.
For a society who has a goal of equality, there sure are a lot of classifications, categories and considerations dividing everyone.

Both of those missed calls should be fireable offenses. How do professionals miss those?

#SaySomethingNiceAboutHillary She doesn't smoke while blaming her kid's asthma on the weather.
@Barton1331 They're going to WIN this series!
@JessicaFastball That's by design. If kids learn how to manage $, they don't need a govt handout &amp; won't be voting for those promising one.
@JessicaFastball Imagine if the govt had to go through the same hoops citizens do to borrow $. We might actually have $ to help needy if so.
Maybe that's why they willingly sign up for student loans and then try to back out on their commitments after. Life is tough, wear a helmet.
Life is all about doing things you don't want and having to listen to people you don't agree with. These college kids are destined to FAIL.
Want to raise a bunch candy asses? Censor movies on campus &amp; create safe zone for the perpetually offended &amp; scared. Good luck with life!
These ppl are so tolerant that a mere MOVIE can't be shown on a campus. Why should NO ONE see it cuz you won't?  
My family owes $600K. Seems sustainable.... Like a guy making $10/hr buying a $3M house.
@OneHourTees @NFLOwnerGBP @CMPunk @c2e2 With all that sitting around, it looks like he FINALLY has time to quit ducking @MilwaukeeLDogg.
Chaser: 
There are people that feel your business shouldn't exist if you have a conversation with politicians they disagree with. Think about that.
All we hear is how COngress is useless &amp; divided. Here we have people not even willing to allow a business to exist for merely LISTENING.
You're telling me the boycott is cuz a business hosted a minority US Senator? Sounds an AWFUL lot like racism. 
LRT:  !!  Personal politics over principles. What a sham.
Hillary 16 - We have to change beliefs 
&amp; if they feel they should be able to set their own policies on religious tolerance then they shouldn't be crying poor about cutting funds.
Schools &amp; Universities get taxpayer funding. I'm not sure they should be setting their own religious tolerance policies against Chick-Fil-A.
For everything some people get from this country, it isn't too much to expect them to pay $1 in taxes.
LRT: The question is, "How can we ensure every taxpayer has at least a $1 net tax liability?" #FairShare
Was going to go to the #brewers game tonight but I dont want to jinx their longest winning streak of the season.
@TheOtherRosie @SharpestJim @TheTopCynic @mcnetthj @KLNorvell @Erhine1 @johnb631 @ter2459 @KFCdemocrats_ Dick Cheney is someone's child.

Bench clearing brawls are merely team building exercises.
If you watch that Eaton at bat, he was yapping at the home plate umpire &amp; took FOREVER to get back in the box the pitch before the fireworks
@Miss_Wisconsin I stand corrected.
@Miss_Wisconsin Come on. Half of Manitowoc has driven past you on Calumet in fishnets. They're on to you :)
@jrehor No TRUE Packers fan would be a Bulls fan. IMPOSTOR.
@dj_gswizzle Packers do suck.... Championships down like cheap beer.
18% of Republican primary voters need to stay home until Nov 2016. Bush &amp; Huckabee? Gross. 
A winning streak? Baseball is 162 one game seasons.
@SteveSGoddard Be sure to get those cub cutlets young. Polar bear meat goes to hell when it ages over 18 months.
Grown men waiting in line to have other grown men sign their name on their stuff because of their skill playing a game.
Your Red Hot Milwaukee Brewers.
It's a PARTY in #Brewers land. A win. A simple win has caused jubilation and we deserve it.
1) Faint 2) Change your shorts 3) Buy lottery tickets 
Let the winning streak begin.
@KaraWitty My tweets don't affect anything. TRUST ME, I've tried.
The #Brewers have a lead in the 9th inning. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
@KFCdemocrats_ @DWStweets &amp; millions of Americans are so busy cashing govt checks that they don't care what happens to keep getting paid.
@KFCdemocrats_ @DWStweets Like a guy driving to a MADD conference hammered. But they use emotional please to justify their behavior.
@KFCdemocrats_ @DWStweets Neither do the people that lecture about climate change while flying around in carbon guzzling planes DAILY.
@ChuckCJohnson These guys build empires &amp; thrive on doubt/criticism. Then they get to DC &amp; shy from any speckle of criticism or blame.
Lots of WI conservs may not like that analysis on Johnson. But not liking something &amp; not being able to stop reality are 2 different things.
RJ is in big trouble. No Midterm wave &amp; Wisc turns out HUGE for Dems in POTUS elections + Feingold is a legit candidate vs Barrett &amp; Burke.
The same guy who used the word "ambiguous" to pin blame on Rice is assigning punishments without convictions. 
Not hustling down the line is a reflection of the manager &amp; lack of urgency. RUN IT OUT. Lots of stuff can be blamed elsewhere but not that.
@Barton1331 It wasn't a bad call if he squeezes right there afterwards. But he let the kid swing away &amp; he got dominated.
@Barton1331 Shoot. The blind rodent took the bat out of one of his best hitters' hands right after that double.
@Barton1331 EXCEPT FOR A BOOMING LEAD OFF DOUBLE IN THE 8TH INNING LAST NIGHT, WISE GUY.
I'd like to report a rape. The person who raped me is named Lisa Madigan. I believe you know her, @TheDailyIllini . 
It's lunch so Begel will need to be changed, hand fed and laid down for a nap. 

Is this enough stereotyping yet, LIKE HIS WHOLE ARTICLE??
But I won't sit idly by &amp; read the bloviations of a senile old man off his medication. He needs a skilled nursing facility not a pad &amp; papar
You guys know it pains me to rip on OMC. I like the mngmt. But I also know Milwaukee is MORE than Bay View, Downtown and The East Side.
Here's a Begel article. BTW, UWM went to the NCAA tournament that season.
"Why does UWM have a basketball program?"

 
Dave Begel couldn't find his ass with both hands if you spotted him one cheek. Would LOVE to live debate that excrement.
I'd be 1000% more ashamed to be associated with Begel than a Right Wing Conservatism. #MilwaukeesFarce  
When hostages are saved, they run into Obama's arms while streamers &amp; confetti are flying. When killed, he's not even in the same hemisphere
Beauty salon? Maybe we should stick to calling them hair salons.
Getaway day at Miller Park. Prime chance for the #brewers to steal one and get the winning streak started. I have high hopes this afternoon.
@CuffyMeh I figured you were too smart to not know that one. Of course D&amp;D... Carry on the assault.
@CuffyMeh Swallows of Capistrano? But I could have just missed a joke here.
Fault of NRA or 3 GOP guys left? RT @JayWeber3: The latest crime estimates for Milwaukee show skyrocketing rates. 
You, sir, have been found GUILTY of impersonating a Vikings fan. RT @Barton1331: Close is an improvement. Way to go Brewers!
Just shaking my damn head. #brewers

Terrible at bat by Jimmy Nelson right there. Get the bunt down in three chances, please. #brewers
Coming in late to the #brewers game. Pleasantly surprised.
@themeiz Serviceman died, I believe in... Japan?
Looks like Scott Boras has not decided to relieve Ron Roenicke of his managerial duties as of yet. Must need another week of this.
@JenLada @prosqtor  I'm saying a player is catching a 25 game suspension from the same ppl denying CTE &amp; he wasn't even convicted of a crime
@JenLada @prosqtor But I will say that I know 2 out of 3 of us are not lawyers, so not my expertise.
@JenLada @prosqtor 1) An independent employer hired by whom? 2) Is employer going to investigate CTE as well, or let the NFL self-report?
Q: So why do people now trust the NFL investigation into Hardy, while rejecting the Ray Rice investigation?
EXACTLY. The NFL is quite a bunch of hypocrites right here. 
.@JenLada What type of flaws did the NFL identify in their own CTE investigation? Or aren't we allowed to compare it to the justice system?
@texaszeller @JessicaFastball LOL. Thx. Appreciate taking the time to respond.
.@prosqtor Yep. The NFL is better at investigating wrong doing than the criminal justice system, except when it comes to CTE investigations.
Still convinced some #brewers are tipping their pitches. In particular Fiers, Lohse and KRod.
Imagine if the @NFL replay reviews were handled like player suspensions. Only need a hunch &amp; a personalized sense of what is right to rule.
I know little about Carly Fiorina &amp; I'm going to change that tonight. I'm intrigued w/ her business acumen, which has been missed for 6 yrs.
@SI_PeterKing Any plans on her investigating Goodell and the NFL for the vast allegations of misconduct and untruthfulness?
Something isn't right about Roger Goodell handing out punishments for bad behavior. This cat would lie in confession if he could turn a buck
All GB fans that wanted a national holiday yesterday should read this article. I wonder who he'll vote for in 2016.

Someone help me out. Why are soccer uniforms called kits?
@Sunbird5274 If we don't blame ppl for their own choices and plight, then who is responsible for their mistakes? Me?
The NRA is the reason for Milwaukee violence &amp; safe zones are the solution. These people live in echo chambers that are devoid of reality.
@JP_Breen @DanODradio @redsteeze Of course not. Amazing how little things matter when you don't type it.
Just think how many more birds could be soaring in the skies on Earth Day if it wasn't for wind and solar farms.

Earth Day? I'm confused... what's going to happen to the Earth? I'm betting nothing until the Sun eventually expands &amp; swallows it whole.
Ira Einhorn and Margaret Sanger are two load bearing columns of modern day liberalism.

@RonRenken Nah. I'll pass.
@Erhine1 Oh..... Hard to take Twitter personally. I think of it as more of a game. But I have made some good friends because of Twitter too.
@Erhine1 @Iifebook This is precisely why I keep the number of people I follow under 400, so I can get to know everyone.
Those are the hard facts. It's not laced with bias &amp; I don't have a financial stake in the outcome other than missing out on free work tix.
The worst thing the owners could have done was raise $200M for Hillary &amp; then come to taxpayers with their hat in their hands. #Optics
This is the risk ppl take when depending on taxpayers of a city that is broken cultural, morally &amp; financially to pay for something.
The downside is the Bucks leave &amp; the city suffers. Which is why both the city &amp; county need to step up. But they're wasting $$ elsewhere.
Potto's $$ wasn't good enough &amp; the owner has raised $200M, just for a cause MORE important than his team's arena. The whole thing is shady.
This Bucks arena financing is a tough deal with both sides having compelling arguments. I'd personally vote NO to any public dollars used.
@iowahawkblog It takes a community to raise... enough money to pay their taxes.
Toure not paying taxes is about the funniest thing ever. Must not have had time to climb down from his haters pulpit.

Remember when he tweeted this? 
@mcnetthj @KLNorvell @TheTopCynic @Erhine1 @SharpestJim @johnb631 @ter2459 @KFCdemocrats_ GM, it's like showing up to a MADD event drunk.
You guys think TLR peers down at the field and knows the fire is still BURNING INSIDE??

Note: Burning not the 7 Fireballs he had at lunch.
You can smell the stink hanging in the air. It's time. #FireRonRoenicke
Tough game, Crew. Get em tomorrow. 148 left.
Your Milwaukee Scrappers!
@mpbMKE Christ. How embarrassing. Back to back innings. That is rock bottom.
You can't go out to talk to your pitcher &amp; then have him promptly give up a 2nd grand slam. What the heck did Kranitz tell him?
Oh my God. Oh my God. This might be the most disappointed I've been with the #Brewers since Game 6.
@themeiz that's right. Heat it.
Break up the #brewers.
@prosqtor Brewers HRs, easy. Still 148-1/2 games left.
#brewers on the rally. Can't keep these scrappers down!
Had time to squeeze in an error first. RT @IgnitorKid: Hit, walk with two outs. Phillips probably goes deep here. #Brewers
Into the ground. RT @D______o______M: @tawnielyn it was mostly rhetorical.. but yeah he always looks like team is running itself.
@Barton1331 first thing I saw. Especially since they stack the Noon games now!
That two seamer Marquis is throwing is darting nicely in the backdoor. That's a tough pitch on the black. Great frame job too. #brewers
@KrisLBurke aren't you a Broncos writer?
@Jcollins205 yes. I just keep pointing out the ridiculousness this whole movement uses for language. It's quite a group.
Bravo! RT @10iskristin: Must have a split squad tonight.
@prosqtor hehehe.
Go down the wormhole of that last RT if you think I'm just being a chauvinist picking on women.
Make the NRA pay for it! RT @prosqtor: @Simplekindoffan maybe they should be asking the mayor about funding choo choo but not arena?
But having Potto get turned down &amp; having the Bucks owner spend time raising $200M for Hillary (&amp; not a new arena) makes it an uphill climb.
View their Bucks tweets through that lense &amp; the community/pride/empty downtown emotional pleas start to reveal a new picture.
I'm sure every local journalist &amp; sports TV personality is ALL IN on the arena. Those outlets can cut some staff if Bucks leave.
@dwalsh76 Dang, you're such a loser! Haha. <THUMBS DOWN SIGN>
LOCAL SPORTS GUY WANTS TO KEEP GETTING PAID TO COVER A LOCAL TEAM./ HENCE, HE WANTS EVERYONE TO PUT THEIR SELFISHNESS ASIDE ON THE ARENA.
@DougRussell Has anyone taken one for the team and attempted a slumpbuster??
Imagine Christie running on a platform of eliminating obesity. About as sincere as Hillary's drive to topple the 1% with $300,000 speeches.
Safe spaces, triggers, microaggresssions. WTF is wrong with educated women in this country?? My 7 yr old daughter is mentally tougher.
That guy is a “senior email campaigner”. I wonder where a senior email campaigner for the DNC got the idea that Beghazi was a joke?
Everyone should make clicking this link and staring at the photo there mandatory reading. Yet they're making jokes. 
Missouri guy has the name of Jim Taylor, yet somehow doesn't know who the famous Green Bay Packers player Jim Taylor is.
@BadgerNoonan @bachlaw  a) Their '14 weaknesses (SS, 1B) are better. b) Better OF depth than early '14. c) Almost everyone wins 11 of 13 too
@BadgerNoonan @bachlaw I'm just a mindless rube, but I still think they can win 90, #NotDrinking  The reasons for my optimism?
Weird, Hillary said yesterday it was stalled. Which view is held from Obama's hip pocket? 
@KCousineau09 @packers Who runs their social media??
@JaymesL THAT SHE KNEW THE CAMERA WAS THERE!!! That's the exact opposite of a peeping- tom. (From what I've been told).
Last yr when I urged caution I was just a contrarian AND WAS CORRECT. This yr I am urging caution &amp; I'm just a contrarian. #brewers #shrug
Each day gets more &amp; more bizarre. They play this game until OCTOBER. Folks need to take a handful of Valiums.  
I'm hearing the The Black Plague is available for a European Reunion as well. 
Try playing cards for money and having someone behind you tell you opponent what cards you DON'T HAVE. #BryanPrice
Of course nobody wants to fix Milw. That would require AA leadership to admit abject failure for 50 yrs in Milw &amp; other large cities as well
But let's hold some rallies, blame the absent GOP &amp; do something, ANYTHING, that doesn't involve looking in a mirror at the face of failure.
You have to change that mentality. Whatever solution is needed to fix the problem, surely Milw Democrats don't have the guts to propose it.
The blame for murders last week was put on the NRA &amp; he we got a kid beat up at a peace rally. It's the violent mentality, not the weapons!
If these residents aren't willing to confront violence, start snitching &amp; TAKE BACK their neighborhood, why should I (or anyone else) care?
If you tolerate violence at a peace rally, what the heck is the point of a peace rally?

@seanmdav @guntruth "I don’t know what impact this ordinance will have".  I'd think this would be the first requirement to passing a law?
@TheGarfoose @awfulannouncing And yet when NFL teams are more secretive than British spies during WWII, they are mocked for not evolving....
I'm guessing there will some others going to jail for the John Doe incident in WI, but they won't be Republicans.
#brewers will bounce back, you'll see.
"gaffe prone" is code for "answers questions asked honestly without a political filter".
Price's rant was essentially the same reason the Packers are so secretive &amp; limiting of media. There's no desire to give away info.

They'll have 16 chances. RT @ProFootballTalk: Lions offensive line looking to "whoop somebody's ass" in 2015 
@juliemsrd Which is why there is no fault, I feel. Both guys are doing their job with different goals. These end goals are bound to clash.
@juliemsrd manager of the Reds. He was pissed because the Reds' beat reporters were tweeting things he felt should stay in house pregames.
@Amplexus4 broken toe. Going on the DL.
Devastating Lucroy news. They're dropping like flies.
OK, #brewers. You don't have to lose them all. Don't be afraid to mix in a W once through the rotation.
@IgnitorKid going deep into the back tonight. Not much else left to do. Go get em again tomorrow.
Empty 9th inning HR. RT @IgnitorKid: @Simplekindoffan ?
Braun doing his best Sammy Sosa impression right there.
KRod is the 9th inning guy.
Bunting into a double play. OK, haven't seen that one in awhile. #brewers.
@MikeVassallo13 Nice to be appreciated. Should have had Narron do the writing though.
Now this cat laid it down right here. A white guy couldn't do this video. It's like we speak the same language.  
Ask yourself these questions honestly because if the answer to any are: YES, then you support punishing thought crime.
If you disagree with the opinions of others, do you have a right to silence them and punish them for holding those views?
Which brings me to a larger point. Is it illegal to be anti-gay? If you think homosexuality is wrong, have you committed a thought crime?
So wait.... The only acceptable public viewpoint on being gay is the "pro" side? That seems a bit hypocritical. 
@jrios68 I have no idea why he copied Baldwin. It's pretty clear she is one of the last people that will be doing anything to help others.
Do WE even know what side we're on these days? 
The lots opening up only 2 hrs and 10 minutes before a #brewers game is a travesty.
@politicalmath @botticellicream That's true. But 1/2 of us will try to shut down one's privately owned business over political differences.
Donald, of all people, should know talent isn't a precursor to success. 
Never before seen so many people give up on a team 5-1/2 GB of the wildcard in the 3rd week of April.
I know you don't you don't care about my 2 baseball leagues. Nobody does! But I have to tell SOMEONE &amp; Twitter is as good as any outlet.
My baseball season has started through 2 gms w/ .400/.400/.600 slash line. Scored go-ahead run tonight after a 6th inning lead off double.
The #brewers game was going great today until the Pirates got a chance to score some runs.
@Moneyman2626 @AndyTarnoff Just about every team in baseball wins 9 out 11 at some point over the trudge of 162.
Not even close, yet. 
#brewers fans just learned last year what happens when you get too high or to low &amp; overreact to a small sample size.
@10iskristin They're going to be fine. They're going to win 90. They're going to participate in the postseason.
I was being serious. Can't wait.
It's a clear night in Los Angeles and Vin Scully is calling a game. Can't wait to hear what he thinks dusk looks like.
Scully. Beers.
@sommersara28 They'll be alright.
@Sam_Kluender June
@BrewCrewCritic I predicted 90 wins. They're fine. Or I'm an idiot. We'll see.
@BrewCrewCritic They're going to be fine.
@BrewCrewCritic I SEE YOUR TRUE COLORS SHINING THROUGH - *in a musical tone*
@Tim_Muma @JP_Breen @bachlaw So is mine. It's difficult when you see them recognize what that behavior does &amp; then see them repeat it again.
That stupid 4 pitch walk came back to hurt him. This isn't very much fun. #brewers

The tailspin seems to be enacted early this evening. #brewers
For those ladies looking to snag a husband, may I submit example A: 


@themeiz @mpbMKE You core guys of Milwaukee Twitter that I like rarely let me down.
@mpbMKE @themeiz GAWD! Yanno is so mainstream. I was saying it long before twitter caught wind of it.
MLB messes a lot of things up. Having a game on now, however, is not one of those times.
@IgnitorKid no
@I_Bleed_Beer The word 'gross' is a microagresssion of mine. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to retreat to my safe place.
@I_Bleed_Beer NOT limited to ballplayers.
Should zoos be one thing the internet eliminates?
@JaymesL Good way to prod on the guy among the league leaders in confidence.
RRR finally managing based on feel &amp; not in a sterile, rigid &amp; dictated roles philosophy. I whole heartily approve. 
Umpire in the Wash/Phi game just got blasted between the eyes with a pitch. Whoa.
@themeiz I'm a stomach sleeper. Shoulder is a bad spot for me, apparently, to have sore if I'm interested in sleeping. #shruggity
@themeiz Enjoying something else in life can make the work part of life tolerable on a everyday basis.
@themeiz Affecting my sleep. But now it'll be cool. Only swing during BP &amp; games now that the season has started.
@themeiz But now all that is done. Wish you luck on your climb. I've never played golf more than sporadically.
@themeiz I've taken more swings this preseason than I've taken since I was 17. My right shoulder has been barking for a couple of weeks.
@themeiz Lunch??
@themeiz Stop out at the ole' 19th hole??
@IgnitorKid I wouldn't trade Segura. Not because he's untouchable at SS. He'd make a fine 2B if the tear down brought a defensive whiz at SS
It appears to me that in the race to prevent extinction, the delta smelt is beating humans thus far.
Tough, but fair. 
@juliemsrd @10iskristin FAIL.
@themeiz Same release point for each pitch, changes speeds and has good location. All there is to it, my boy.
My first baseball game of the season is in 12 hours. Can't wait!
Welp, that ought to about do it. Broxton brought his gas can to put out the fire tonight. #brewers
@IgnitorKid He is almost always a slow starter.
@IgnitorKid I'm not a comic guy, but it looked all right to me.
@IgnitorKid 
@IgnitorKid How long was the one you saw? Is there more than one?
@IgnitorKid And why didn't you like the Superman/Batman trailer?
Scooter prevented the possible floodgates from opening with a pretty sweet short hop right there. That was a big time play. #brewers
@juliemsrd @10iskristin They're going to win this game.
@IgnitorKid Haha.
@10iskristin I love your Brewers twitter. Always fun.
The Anglo-Zanzibar War was closer than that last Marte stolen base. Lucroy had NO chance. #brewers
It couldn't possibly be that the same ppl freaking out in Apr 2015 are the same ones that were preening &amp; Cadillac-ing in Apr 2014? #brewers
@juliemsrd It's in the bag tonight.
@RichardMChang Just wait until that workload trickles down. Nobody is going to like that. Good topic, Chang.
@RichardMChang No chance. They think it eliminates one layer of inequality in the workplace but what it does is limit upward mobility.
Lots of folks are lauding this video but 'eye for an eye' justice is what got 2 ppl killed Sunday in Milwaukee. 
@benshapiro Can I be on the side that doesn't use unanswerable hypotheticals to score political points?
@jrios68 Hell, teacher's unions don't even care about teachers.
@BoingBoing Maybe you'd have preferred left wing lunatics protesting, shutting you down &amp; sending death threats to your family?  @redsteeze
It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness. 

-Leo Tolstoy
@redsteeze I try to stick to Caturdays for my cat memes.
@jrios68 Ever notice that teacher's union supporters often avoid declaring their support of the students, which should be the 1st priority?
@ProfessorFlynn @ChuckCJohnson Your very first tweet wasn't an insult? I just responded in a similar manner. Keep spinning.
@ProfessorFlynn @ChuckCJohnson I do. You were jumping in to be a DICK. Mission accomplished.
@ProfessorFlynn @ChuckCJohnson Replying to a tweet from someone I follow isn't needless. Jumping into a convo when not invited is.
@ProfessorFlynn @ChuckCJohnson I've been following him for awhile, so I guess I'll trust my judgement. But thanks for chiming in needlessly!
@ChuckCJohnson Why do you have to support either? Can't they both be wrong? There are no winners here and you're better than this, Chuck.
@juliemsrd You know what Chicago doesn't have? Republicans.
This idea that the GOP is racist is good fodder for lazy millenials but falls apart quickly when examining real life historical examples.
@cesooner @mrgeology You could ask an old Japanese- American which political party encourages rights and which one takes them away.
@GopherBrokeBaby I knew what you meant and anyone with a brain did too.
I try to make this point (among others) on a daily basis. 
I checked out what the heck Phiten necklaces were. Now my browser is full of ads. Who knew it was such a cottage industry?
@juliemsrd My bad. I thought you replied to my Ricky Chiles tweet. Disregard that earlier reply. Yeah, lots of media folks are covering her.
@juliemsrd There are a SHIT LOAD of people defending her.
@GopherBrokeBaby Solid tweet.
Say what you want about the girlfriend of Ricky Chiles. But I will say you cannot find loyalty like that from many places these days.
@GopherBrokeBaby And this is the rub. She continued without regard for consequences. This crazy liberal society has made this commonplace.
@GopherBrokeBaby That's because the NFL doesn't have a constitution to protect individuals from the all powerful NFL.
Look on your TL. Those clowns defending McHenry? They're the true danger. They put personal feelings ahead of principles. #Hypocrites
.@GopherBrokeBaby We have got to quit taking into account the sex/race of a speaker when determining sexism/racism. Either it is or it isn't
@ReviewngTheBrew Being good enough to make the playoffs &amp; being good enough to truly compete for a Championship are two different entities.
@ReviewngTheBrew I don't read BCB, so neither did I. BUT, I've been advocating for a complete tear down for 3 years.
When the local sports radio guys thinks a 1% arena sales tax is no big deal, he's acting in self-preservation for his own selfish reasons.
@ReviewngTheBrew Rebuilding involves tearing down today for tomorrow &amp; losing, badly for a few yrs. Otherwise, it's just called reloading.
@ReviewngTheBrew Signing 30 something pitchers to lucrative free agent deals isn't rebuilding. Trading those players for prospects would be.
These damn people living in and around DC are straight up delusional and detracted from actual real life.
Tony Kornheiser has some thoughts on why Marco shouldn't be POTUS, from something that happened when he was eight! 
@mkhammer @seanmdav When we start condoning actions like this based on context, soon all will feel justified, based on their own context.
Chief Flynn blamed talk radio for Milwaukee's violence. Talk radio! You know leadership is void of solutions when they blame free media.
The way the media is rallying around McHenry it ALMOST makes you forget what would happen if the pro- media female was an anti-media male.
It quite literally takes a community to pay @MHarrisPerry's tax bill. How about squaring that away before 'helping' me raise my kids?
@JP_Breen I think he'll hit more HRs because a 330 ft fly ball is good enough with the wind blowing out many times. Maybe 6 or 7 cheapies.
I'd be interested in hearing the viewpoint of someone in favor of the new quality filter on Twitter.
@MadMaxDownUnder I live across the street from the city. I live in the crappiest part of Greenfield. No one wants to buy our house.

@Moneyman2626 I was rude to you earlier. My apologies.
@Miss_Wisconsin He was essentially dead yesterday when reports surfaced he cut a deal on his time served for last time he got got.
Because of the Green Bay Sunday morning TV schedule 30 yrs ago, I associate #LeeRemmel with Oscar The Clown.
This guy was old when I watched him as a kid on Sunday AMs 30yrs ago. Knew more Packers history than anyone. RT @jrehor: RIP Lee Remmel
We're never going to eliminate sexism &amp; racism as a culture until we QUIT taking into account the sex &amp; race of the offending speaker.
@GopherBrokeBaby Palin? Buchanan? They'd be grilled.
I am almost certain the Brewers will not maintain a .222 winning %. Stay the course. Last year we had folks buying April playoff tix!
@MadMaxDownUnder @OnWisconsin016 just search 'britt mchenry'
@BrittMcHenry Nah, I think we just saw the real person. No amount of beauty makes up for that unattractiveness.
For example, there are really smart Packers fans on Twitter, but many are some of the biggest violators of personal feelings vs principles.
The point of this? If you can identify the weak that often choose personal feelings over principles, you can save A LOT of time on here.
If that video had conservative white guy in it, you can be certain folks wouldn't be requesting what was the context of the comments.
Folks seeking context in the McHenry video are showing that their personal feelings get in the way of what they KNOW to be right &amp; wrong.
@AndyTarnoff They'll be fine. Sit back and enjoy the other 153 games.
Politicians that want to raise the retirement age really are offering sacrifices that only affect around 65% of us, but benefit 100% of us.
Will Smith has 5 appearance in 9 games. I guess we didn't learn anything last year about wearing him out when using him down three runs!
@OnWisconsin016 All this stuff is rooted in jealousy.
@OnWisconsin016 Or by people haven't worked their whole life to get an employment opportunity and thus do not appreciate their actions.
@OnWisconsin016 Not so common any longer. Which is why I went back to being anonymous.
@VT_MikeBrown Congrats, that's quite the accomplishment!
@OnWisconsin016 Now Twitter? I'm loaded for bear every day but almost always try to return how I am treated here. #ResponderNotAggressor
@wallypingel I agree. I'll probably be up really really late watching/listening to the replay tonight.
@OnWisconsin016 The measure of a (wo)man's character is how they treat ppl who can do nothing for them personally. I try to follow this IRL.
@OnWisconsin016 Fat, stupid, low income, education, appearance and teeth. She covered all the low hanging fruit.
@KFCdemocrats_ @johnb631 @mcnetthj @KLNorvell @TheTopCynic @Erhine1 @SharpestJim @ter2459 Yeah &amp; he surged downward to near 40% HERE IN WI.
LRT: That's the REAL reason why 1/2 of the state's politicians are not eager to borrow $ for an arena with almost 90% state opposition.
@VickiMcKenna If they were NRA members, would this article include that information?
SOme Tweeps want to see what preceded McHenry's tirade, you know, for justification. Good God, people. Just pretend she was a white male!
I have a feeling there are going to be lots of these. 
I bet if I dug deep, which I will not, Britt McHenry likes to talk the talk, but not walk the walk. That, my friends, is a hypocrite.
@dj_gswizzle Good Point. Chicago is a good model to follow.
I'll just say this... @BrittMcHenry didn't get on TV because of her brains. I bet she's preached tolerance on her TL many times too.
Why do Milwaukee leaders keep blaming the NRA for Milwaukee violence? a) no self incrimination b) Low IQ people believe what they're told.
#ConfessYourUnpopularOpinion I thought Anakin Skywalker had a legitimate beef with the High Council &amp; they helped create Darth Vader.
Not great day to be a WI conservative. Lots of pessimism &amp; plenty of infighting between those loyal to Walker &amp; those entrenched in reality.
No GOP wave in a midterm election, of which almost no Dems survived that bloodbath. Feingold will get the 20% WI POTUS election boost too,
It was probably 3 months ago that I had a few long drawn out discussions about Russ Feingold. I said then he was serious threat to Johnson.
@RobSchroeder12 @Moneyman2626 She doesn't have to be. We know about her burrito yesterday, but not about servers. MSM is her Offensive Line.
Again, it isn't about who the best candidate is, it's about who can get the GOP base to show up, while negating Dem strengths.
It's really simple. nominate any of the GOP people not on my list &amp; you're looking at POTUS Hillary or Lady Chieftain Warren.
@Moneyman2626 @RobSchroeder12 I don't think you fully comprehend the voting motivations of the GOP base &amp; why they clean up in midterms.
@RobSchroeder12 @Moneyman2626 &amp; the GOP base will stay home again if the candidate is a 'realist'. McCain, Romney, Rubio. ALL 'REALISTS'.
@Moneyman2626 @RobSchroeder12 One of us is right and one of us is you. Sorry to break it to you.
@Barton1331 @Moneyman2626 Example A of why Carson can and will win: Sheriff Clarke. 
He draws big numbers from Dems because of race.
@Moneyman2626 @RobSchroeder12 While his entire fucking base stays home again because he a complete immigration and amnesty sell out.
@RobSchroeder12 @Moneyman2626 White Hispanics not endorsed by the Tea Party have less of a chance of winning the general than Bush!
@Moneyman2626 We've already had this discussion. I'll be proven right, if he's given the chance.
@TamraTellsIt My point is the elites pushing the arena could care less about the city or the state. Much like their streetcar nonsense.
Bush is front runner, sadly. My pick? Ben Carson is my choice &amp; he can most certainly win.   
@TamraTellsIt Eastsiders don't care about what the rest of the state thinks. They don't even care about what the rest of Milw thinks.
Not only is Walker failing at his job right now in the eyes of voters, but the fact he has NO CHANCE in the general election is ignored too.
PRO TIP: Your numbers as a Governor go down when you spend all of your time in IA, NH, SC, and Europe.
@erikbilstadWTMJ @Haudricourt @journalsentinel As soon as word got out that he flipped on his last case, he was already a dead man.
@PriscoCBS C'mon Pete! Luck is preparation meeting opportinity. If they weren't prepared, they have no luck. As a GB fan, give some credit.
As soon as word got out yesterday that Ricky Chiles had played ball with prosecutors on his last case, he was a dead man regardless.
@ReviewngTheBrew Got to hold the line until June when Ramirez wakes up, like usual.
@ReviewngTheBrew To me, the D is more important than the O, in terms of winning consistently.
@ReviewngTheBrew But without Parra, we'd be looking at Schafer, which is a massive downgrade. They'll be fine &amp; we're lucky to have Parra.
Anyone that watched the game last night knew last night that GoGo was going on the DL. That hammy could be a problem all season for him.

I'm just going to submit this without further comment: 

When Milwaukee gets their streetcar, all of this violence will finally come to an end.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ it's better than nothing!
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Right, big names get the nod if close. Parra is anything but that.
Ugh. Gotta win the series tomorrow. Tough one to watch tonight though. Some days the hits fall with guys on base and some days they don't.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I don't know of many teams that can replace their gold glove CF with a gold glove OF off the bench. It's sweet.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ People get hurt. Not good for his game predicated on speed though. Parra is nice to have.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ noticeable limp. Not good at all.
@10iskristin ARam with April base hits.

Guys, some writer compared Cutler to Favre so that you would read his article, become outraged &amp; discuss all afternoon. YOU GOT GOT.
I don't get upset on Twitter when I argue with someone but rather when I get a disappointing glimpse at the true person behind the fascade.
@Cam60475637 @SarCatStyX @mrgeology @scout_nj @ScottSdbrown using modern day benchmarks, Lincoln was most certainly a racist. Don't distort.
*Then Nixon sprinkled some magic dust on the GOP &amp; suddenly the liberators were the racist oppressors, all while leaving big city politics.*
@mrgeology @Cam60475637 @scout_nj @ScottSdbrown @SarCatStyX Cannot believe the RACISM involved with questioning the birthplace of a minority
LRT: I tweeted about this type of thing earlier. I RT'd it so my liberal followers could see what I was talking about in. How is this cool?
Before SM, the only way to be against racism/sexism was to practice it daily. Now we can RT a hashtag &amp; pat ourselves on the back.
Most don't really care about racism/sexism. They only care when it can be used to show how sensitive/tolerant they are on gang up Twitter.
Look closely at your lib friends who've been preaching racism/sexism. Point out treatment of minority GOP candidates &amp; prepare for silence.
Always disappointed when I take a liking to someone who spends 5 yrs preaching &amp; quits when it's time to put the preaching into practice.
@MiltownBucky I wish you the best of luck.
@MiltownBucky AYFKM?? Jeez, Will. Haven't been this disappointed in a follower in quite some time. I had you seperated from many of the rest
@sallykohn Plus, Warren's a minority. That plays big for us everyday people like Hillary.
@MiltownBucky If Chief Flynn was black and Clarke was white, the shit would be hitting the fan. You must at least admit this???????
@MiltownBucky If you can't observe this simple case of political based hypocrisy, then I don't know what to say. Couldn't be more obvious.
@MiltownBucky Interesting that Flynn just wants to innocently solve a problem but the TP are hateful bigots hell bent on hurting minorities.
@MiltownBucky THE TEA PARTY JUST HAS A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT IT. *cough that sounds like 'bullshit' *
@MiltownBucky No. I see a white man using his power of influence to denigrate minority speaking out on behalf of the ppl that elected him.
I've only got another 9500 bigot jokes left for anyone criticizing my preferred minority political candidate &amp; I intend on telling them all.
.@MiltownBucky Obviously the white guy is a RACIST!!! How dare him criticize a minority doing his best to clean up the last guy's mess.

I don't get my sex based employment statistics from people that can't be honest about their ethnic background. #LadyChieftainWarren
@CuffyMeh There's a bit of loss suffered through translation. In Yemen, a cleric is a man that works in a local employment office. #NeedJobs
My bad. He appeared on 'Choose or Lose" on MTV. But you get the point. Pandering is bad now, apparently. 
@redsteeze Rubio is just pandering for young votes. Everyone knows the correct procedure is to grab a saxophone when pandering.
The spin today is that Rubio is just talking about rappers for votes. Weird, I thought playing a sax on MTV did just that, but I guess not.
The best thing the Brewers/Bucks could possibly do, in terms of logos, is go back to their awesome retro versions that everyone LOVES!
@juliemsrd Yeah, two guys. One that grew up here &amp; one that had a Mom visit on a foreign exchange program once. That's coveted NY talent!
Late to the party here, but the new Bucks logo is horrendous. I wouldn't outfit a team of oxen in that mess, let alone professionals.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @mpbMKE I didn't get this whole roleplay thing last week. I read it for awhile, didn't even smile. Not my genre I guess
@mpbMKE @Enrico_Palazzo_ No doubt. My issue is ppl confusing these sites for news &amp; using this stuff as a basis for their political osmosis.
And that quandary is why I go ballistic when cuts are view as evil, when we're BORROWING $$ to pay for Fed programs!! That isn't real life.
UW has a massive slush fund &amp; small cuts are seen as draconian &amp; harsh. If UW can't trim their belt with MILLIONS, how can entitlements???
SNAP is a food assistance program that starts with the word Supplemental. Somehow, we've forgotten what the word supplement means.
But we have a trolly without even a referendum. WTF is wrong with this collection of morons in Milw??  
@mpbMKE @Enrico_Palazzo_ I think this is the mindset of the media. +, I know there is fear of black voters staying home for old white women.
Vice President Obama?? Someone please stop these people.  
@RonRenken Which makes sense if he conducted his press conference in a room full of mirrors.
Now two brothers are dead plus the guy that stopped immediately after the accident. 3 dead &amp; nobody is talking. Yet, cops are the problem?
The thing that really bothers me about Sunday's accident/shooting in Milw is the guy killed a 15yr old &amp; nobody has stepped up to ID shooter
Milwaukee is on pace for 200 murders in 2015 &amp; the mayor blames a group of trained citizens that have contributed nothing towards the 200!
A pretty awesome #Brewers game that I just finished. BTW, RRR putting the go ahead run on base intentionally was sheer madness.
You can't demand everyone be treated equally &amp; then treat people differently when saying the same sentence, based on race of the speaker.
If I had a drone, I could be watching the Brewers in the basement versus spending time supervising my kids. Hook up a speaker &amp; I'm golden!
@dexhandle You can never, ever blame Aaron Rodgers. Ever.
I know what Hillary had for lunch, but not why she deleted ALL of her emails. Think about that.
@RBNolden Out of college I was #3, have moved up to #1 over the years. I think the job gets easier the higher up the chart one goes.
Selling hierarchy:

1) Stuff ppl want &amp; need.
2) Stuff ppl want but don't need
3) Stuff ppl need but don't want
4) Stuff nobody wants/needs
SIGN ME UP! 
@juliemsrd Ted Kennedy?
@10iskristin I thought I'd do a welfare check after that horrific beatdown in the @TweetSmackLeeg. A hammer vs a nail is more competitive...
John Lester doesn't throw to first base. Billy Hamilton is really fast. I'm disappointed I won't see these go at it tonight...
There ought to be a service that connects whiny Yelp reviewers with people that need practice punching things.
@redsteeze If there are questions that need to asked of Hillary, the proper credentialed media will be given those questions &amp; answers.
LRT: Of course that's the way it will be. But this is journalism in an era that stupid consumers allow the media to get away with it.
@BrianCarriveau I don't want to live in a world without the '31 Dive' on 3rd &amp; short.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I'm guessing it'll take a lot less than 8 yrs to get REALLY FUCKING TIRED of this approach being taken EVERY FUCKING TIME.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Quit minimizing his ancestry to score political points, you bigot. It's obvious you only dislike him because of his race.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Cruz is a minority &amp; you are white, therefore, racism. Get ready for that 8 yrs of bullshit to come home to roost, BIGOT
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I won't tolerate your racism.
Liberals hate Ted Cruz and the GOPe fears him. That tells me he's the right candidate for the job. He should keep the heat on both groups.
LRT: it's almost as if Vox isn't really a news source, but rather a cheerleading squad for one side of the political debate.
How many meals for homeless minority children could be purchased with the money being spent on Rolling Stones Summerfest tickets??
@JP_Breen That's so weird. I perceived Martinez as the fireballer &amp; Kelly as the control guy in St Louis. Surprised to read he's over 95.
@kuze81 @Popehat @lpolgreen It's curious that personal responsibility applies to creating comics but not to family planning and welfare.
Marco Rubio isn't a female. Therefore, he is not qualified to be a President.
A guy that smokes blames his daughter's asthma on climate change and not on his smoking.
People might move to the suburbs because a car accident there isn't met with an instant death sentence. 
Springer with quite a web gem in a big spot. Wow!
I'm #ReadyForHillary like I'm ready to jam a fork in an electrical outlet.
Not an optimal result from the #brewers today. The bullpen is scuffling.
Nice work by Roenicke to allow his catcher hit the pavement.
MASH Season 2, episode 13 had both John Ritter &amp; Pat Morita. A lot of talent in that 25 minutes.
I can think of 4 guys that might have voted for Hillary. But thanks to her leadership they won't have that chance.

8:15 and not a stir in our house. It might be time to grab a small mirror and see if anyone is breathing.
Nelson on the John Deere mowing Pirates down. There's a lot to like about this kid's future. #Brewers
When Jimmy Nelson gets ahead 0-2, that slider is filthy.
On 8/25/14, the #brewers were 73-58 &amp; in 1st place. They have since won 9 of 35 regular season games for a .257 win %.  #FireRonRoenicke
@RAYROBERT9 Ha ha. That's a good point. I only picked it up a few innings ago. Lots of zeros.
16th inning baseball is fun. I don't care who is playing.
Begrudgingly watching the Sawks and Yankees.
I guarantee you that I could commandeer this team to an 0-4 start. So could you.
@themeiz Where are you buddy?? GoGo at the 2 bag!!
Braun at 2B?
Down by multiple runs with a runner in scoring position and you get caught stealing with two outs?? That's bad.
@Steevo36 Especially THAT guy. A walk can be a triple in a hurry.
The Dondlinger Doppelganger strikes again. cc: @IgnitorKid
The #brewers are playing with a lack of urgency. It's not exciting to watch, that's for sure.
@bachlaw True. Got to have a good launch angle as well.
I enjoyed the new Cinderella &amp; the girls loved it. I'd recommend this film if you have girls &amp; aren't gender neutral advocates.
Lind &amp; Scooter getting the start against a lefty. That's... interesting.
re: Sarah Palin shooting: Sexist! Also,. looking forward to some victim shaming later today.
@D______o______M #FireRonRoenicke
Nobody liked the The Red Baron for Lind. He'd be the biggest Baron in the Midwest since Baron von Raschke. Marketing $s, yo.
@MadMaxDownUnder Just 3 games. They could be 0-9 and I'd be cool. Swoons happen.
Taking the girls (3 &amp; 7) to see Cinderella tomorrow. *Pay No Attention To Day Baseball While On Vacation, Dad*........
@jrehor You can level with me.
@jrehor You should be good. If I were you, I'd wear that Viking helmet I KNOW you have hiding under your bed from the Minnesota Favre days.
@jrehor Quit screwing around on Twitter and get to the attic!
#ThingsBetterThanTheIranDeal Taking a quick swim while wearing potassium trunks.

Remember that trolly that was passed without a referendum when you hear about our sewage being dumped into our drinking water. #priorities
This museum is packed today. I even checked to make sure today wasn't a free day.
@joym13 The 3rd yr old is being an untamed beast but the 7 yr old loves it.
Taking the kids for a nice day at the museum. Or, we'll rush through it &amp; I'll be disgusted at their lack of appreciation for art/history.
But gay people! RT @ElbridgeColby: Big deal: NORAD ADM says North Korean ICBM KN-08 can deliver nuke warhead to U.S. 
Peralta playing with fire hanging meat out there.
@mjheitk Can get one of him anywhere. Just costs a Lucroy to walk out with him. lol.
@IgnitorKid You've left yourself dangerously open here for a counter comment.
The Red Baron is on fire!! #brewers
#Brewers pyro guy trying to light a spark.
@AndyTarnoff Only a few years older than Hillary. However, I will concede that she has shot less people.
The #brewers are going to turn it around tonight. Book it.
@MiltownBucky Ha. I'm just kidding around. My condolences to the Marotta family.
@MiltownBucky That's where I'm going.
Now I need to find out Marotta's views on the new arena proposal.
@Steevo36 They don't. I was talking in the context of plan vs plan.
Why does the arena have to be a massive $1B undertaking when all the current plan needs is the City &amp; County to chip in a realistic amount?
@Virtuemudd Hey! That tactic has produced half of the offensive output thus far.
LRT: THAT is how you change things in a civilized society. Not by rallying around false narratives &amp; burning down local businesses.
@justinjabs should have started doing sit up by the thousands &amp; named yourself JustinAbs.
The Brewers are 0-2 this season in games I do not watch. That turns around tonight. Also, #FireRonRoenicke.
@jrehor I'm not much of a college basketball guy since I cut the cable cord. But I did see UW lose to Duke twice this year.
Not a real fan <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> RT @jrehor: Didn't even watch the game last night
Welp, yesterday sucked for a Wisconsin sports fan. There was less heartbreak when our teams just stunk, that's for sure.
Bad refereeing of not, UW didn't play their best.

Wisconsin seniors(4): 28 pts, 10-27 FG;
Best 2 out of 3?
Sam Dekker disappeared tonight. Much like the first game, that was the difference.
I'm catching a whiff of overtime in the air.
About to watch the Badgers play for the National Championship.
The Brewers have already quit on Roenicke!
@KCousineau09 2 years ago I tweeted that at 12:01AM on New Years Day. Haha.
#FireRonRoenicke
The only ppl that will be punished over the entire UVA scandal is the frat that did nothing wrong. Think about that type of rape culture.
OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY!!  What a day in store for Wisconsin sports.
I like the permanent strike zone box on the CF view.
@themeiz You're dead to me.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Going to pummel you throughout the fantasy baseball landscape. PREPARE. 4 leagues together. Let's do this.
I guess Kimbrel owners should be happy he moves to a team that looks like they are going to win some games.
@RH4ever @KCousineau09 I'm helping my cousin build some sort of chicken housing structure up in Brussels on his farm. So sort of working.
@KCousineau09 All good. Sort of a narrow audience tweet. Anyway, Opening Day and the big game. I'm on vacation too. Gonna be a wild one.
@KCousineau09 The pizza place in Indiana that was happy to serve gay folks, just not cater a wedding. A wedding that has never took place.
I spent 4 days listening to people outraged over fake pizza &amp; now they say we should move on from last night's actual incident. Uh, OK.
Thanks to yesterday, the Badgers are 1-0 when I dine at Red Lobster beforehand. Numbers don't lie.
Diamond Stone didn't want to be a part of the fun, huh? I mean, Maryland??
@SaraMechell Yep, we had a mini Christmas. Girl Scout cookies are gone and the candy supply has been replenished.  HATE ON.
I'm one to always cut the amateurs some slack, they're just kids. But there's zero excuses for the behavior displayed by Kentucky afterwards
Use of racial slurs only upstaged by walking off the court without shaking hands. There is no class for those student athletes.
Why are folks upset at Harrison? If you follow me, then you know the race of the speaker NOW determines whether speech is racist.
Guys, in college, you shake hands after a win or a loss. That was some pretty classless stuff right there.
It's amazing how easy games are to close out when one team has a bunch of upperclassmen.
UW is one game away. Amazing.
Kentucky is undefeated, shot 60% &amp; they're still not winning?
They look beatable to me.
Based strictly on my wealth of basketball IQ, here's what I think will happen for UW tonight:
@themeiz @Enrico_Palazzo_ ...
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Maybe start up a GoFundMe account &amp; see what I can raise for the event?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @IgnitorKid Pit Bulls AREN'T ALLOWED AT OUR CHRISTIAN EVENT.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I got a single gold egg and inside will be a crisp $10 bill. That's how you motivate older kids to HUNT.
You got to make those kids earn it.
Laying a bunch of eggs out in plain view isn't Eater Egg 'Hunting' more than going grocery shopping is hunting.
@KFCdemocrats_ Gotcha. Have a great day.
@KFCdemocrats_ Where in Milwaukee you at? I'm over by Alverno.
@mcnetthj @KLNorvell @TheTopCynic @Erhine1 @SharpestJim @RealBenLund @ter2459 @KFCdemocrats_ GM all. I'm pretty pumped for tonight.
@Bobacheck @SenTedCruz lol. Sorry. It's been Carson 1, Cruz 2 for me for quite a while. Welcome aboard.
@Bobacheck You know, instead of a moderate we always end up with.
@Bobacheck Cruz is a bulldog. He's what we've been begging for: someone that can eloquently state the Tea Party views &amp; not wilt from them.
@KCousineau09 Full footies on?
@jrsalzman @ChuckCJohnson @alixbryan Remember when FDR caged up a bunch of people, just in case?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @themeiz @MiltownBucky Receive an Ayn Rand novel with each teen book club membership fee.
@MiltownBucky @themeiz @Enrico_Palazzo_ Never started.
@themeiz @Enrico_Palazzo_ @MiltownBucky That's a good direction!
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @themeiz @MiltownBucky But this is the liberal bounce back response, so it has to rally them. Some Christian requirement.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @themeiz Oh hell no. Lmao.
@DrChimRickles Impressive!
@themeiz @Enrico_Palazzo_ This conversation has forced me to crack a beer.
@themeiz @Enrico_Palazzo_ You're gonna need that cash for bail.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @themeiz Yeah. We set the usher up. Our stories match. His hands are shaking, grandpa needs a nap &amp; we get paid.
I just offered Harper for Springer in a dynasty league. Straight Up. I'm all in on the kid.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ BINGO!
@Enrico_Palazzo_ The new Miller Park screening rules could have early bugs. Might be some cracks to exploit. Can work over an 80yr old usher
@Enrico_Palazzo_  The left isn't going to stand for this charity upstanding. They'll have their big donation too. Might as well be us. #gold
@Enrico_Palazzo_ I'm a white conserv male &amp; you're Jewish. Surely there's a way for me to be Twitter shamed &amp; us to make $900K in donations?
@Samcro69Mp @SooperMexican Yep, Probably should have just said that.
@SooperMexican It's astounding to think about how many others could have been helped with that $ if not for religious intolerance.
.@juliemsrd I never really gave him a 2nd thought. FYI: My recruiting expertise stops at the free ESPN recruiting info on the team page.

@Jehfield148 I've stumbled into your convos a few times &amp; I like your well reasoned viewpoints but I can spend 10 mins in those rabbit holes
#FF @Jehfield148 This cat gets deep into the weeds sometimes, but he's a fun follower, if you value freedom.
.@RhettBollinger @AdamMcCalvy Hey, it was a slip!! Not a violation. Time to get an arbiter involved.
@mattyglesias All of the skeletons won't fit in a closet?
@Barton1331 @RobSchroeder12 I can't remember the name of my high school baseball coach, but I can remember Martha Burke? It's a curse.
@Barton1331 Thank you, Martha Burke.
@BillSimmons Is that when Reggie went back to back in XXXI? One of my favorites. Good call ;)
To me, the craziest thing about this week ended up being that @alixbryan is verified and @iowahawkblog is not.
@CNauz @DLoesch PFFFT. I'm pro-gay marriage and ant-religion. But I'm pro freedom first. It's a distinction you fail to appreciate.
@CNauz @DLoesch The ignorant being outraged over hypothetical pizza is what started this whole thing.
@CNauz @DLoesch I hope do too. Then we can start a legal defense fund for Dana that exceeds $500K. Oh, that crafty &amp; profit seeking Dana!
I love politics, went to school for it &amp; apologize for nothing. It's not like I sent out follower requests.
Most normal people get tired of this tit for tat political struggle. I thrive on it. Been one of my favorite days on Twitter in along time.
@FauxctCheck @scottlincicome @redsteeze To be clear, they allegedly started this ruse back when the Clintons &amp; Obamas opposed gay marriage?
@CBS6 Can't believe you allow your social media ppl to tweet baseless claims of fraud. YOU wouldn't like it if YOU were a target like this.
@BerniePleskoff I'd agree, if Braun's thumb was bothering him. But it seems to be good &amp; Ramirez adds a nice 3-4 punch &amp; RBI collectors.
@CuffyMeh Your gender assignment is a trigger.
We got death threats, arson threats &amp; reporting tweets to employers over an imaginary pizza. WHY CAN'T CONGRESS PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES?
The Badgers are too white but when examining reasons, academics isn't analyzed. Can't make this stuff up. 
Chaffetz issued subpoenas for 2 secret service agents &amp; they leak he got rejected when applying? Man alive, this administration....
@SykesCharlie I'm calling it now, Charlie. Tom Barrett was in on that attack 5 years ago, in hopes of being Governor.
@redsteeze Unfortunately, I live on a tiny piece of land between NY and LA called America.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ The only logical solution is to call in death threats and burn the place to the ground. That's what we do these days.
If you have to factor in the race/religion/sex of the speaker before determining if what they say is offensive, THEN YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Calling it a slip &amp; not a violation is HILARIOUS considering you can get suspended for unknown ingredients in a supplement.
@IgnitorKid No way! That entire episode was a farce and the morons driving that bus are doing the same thing here in IN. It's all related.
The recent gay uproar has me chuckling about a time when speculating on Rodgers' girlfriend was cool, but on a boyfriend was horribly wrong.
Someone walks into YOUR business and asks you a hypothetical question that has never actually happened and YOU get blamed for motive?
Word for word rip off of @MiltownBucky. This is new spam..... 
@MiltownBucky &amp; not all forms of discrimination are illegal or even improper. For example, Curves discriminates against me on a daily basis.
@MiltownBucky All we need to do is make the baker/pizza owner a Muslim &amp; 'unjust' isn't the adjective used by Atlantic.
@Jcollins205 I know you &amp; Meiz are up there, but I hardly ever go w/ baseball all summer &amp; since the fam is gone all the time... #homealone
@wisemanwise @RedGiantUnion Anyone that disagrees with your emotional based opinion??
@MiltownBucky 'unjust' laws. LMFAO. Keep churning that butter, Will.
@juliemsrd Considering seats &amp; parking for 2 hrs of entertainment, I don't think it's a good value. #brewers are 2x as long &amp; 1/2 the cost
@juliemsrd There must be a good reason, but I'm struggling to see what it is.
@BrianCarriveau Isn't this your last day? Are they going to have to search your pockets on the way out?
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Sweet. Now I just have to get this grift started. I'm on vacation next week too, which will be perfect from blowback.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ It would be fun.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ The Yacht would OWN Kelly Lake.
@seanmdav The war on events that haven't actually happened. In other news, I'm handily winning my war on black holes swallowing the Earth.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Playing hard to get for a yacht invite, huh?
Why would people from LaCrosse, Superior, Eau Claire, Wausau, Rhinelander and Sturgeon Bay spend tax dollars on a MILWAUKEE arena?
I'm starting to think that I should be targeted by the LGBQT crowd so I can be fired, threatened, raise $500K &amp; buy a luxury yacht.
@jrehor Best time to tweet. Starting lobbing bombs JR!
@DrChimRickles I've got about 200 miles of the trail done so far.
@RedGiantUnion Bigots aren't making you notable. Your hatred and treatment of people you disagree with is making you notable.
@benshapiro President Pinky Swear?
@BrewCrewCritic Hard to argue.
126,000 jobs?  DAMN YOU, BUSH!!!
And that GoFundMe website for that pizzeria is near, if not over, $500,000. What was the whole point?
Of course, conservative media have started releasing hidden camera Muslim bakery videos. Quite an age for journalism &amp; identity politics.
@JimmyPrinceton I personally like how dark &amp; angst ridden the show gets.
@D______o______M get to the roof!
@TundraVision Oh.....
@TundraVision One of the great follies in history is trying to interpret what the Founding Fathers MEANT vs just following what they wrote.
@MileyCyrus Freedom is important, especially the freedoms you don't agree with. That's tolerance in America.
@RedGiantUnion @OhioCoastie At this point, what difference does it make?? Nice try.  It might be time to grab a dunce cap &amp; find a corner.
@sweetharturbald I am.
LRT: SJW wants to rob a business cuz they don't agree with gay marriage. An opinion, not an action. This will get worse until YOU say enough
A majority of Americans approve of some type deal with Iran. A majority also approves of rain, just not in their living rooms. #Context
@Moneyman2626 @Barton1331 I'd say only one side is motivated to tell the truth after the deal is made.
@Barton1331 @Moneyman2626 Nah, you got the cliff notes version.
@Barton1331 There would have to get an agreement first. All they have right now is a framework. There hasn't even been a kickoff yet.
This administration didn't score a touchdown. All they've done is correctly get in formation. A signature is a touchdown. #CoffeeForClosers
Read this and put your principles to the test. The law of unintended consequences. 
After 6 years and 73 days, we've hit rock bottom. I have not doubt we'll sink even lower but as of right now, this is it.
@redsteeze Sounds like a lack of trust. I'd be sure to get it in writing to be safe.
Personally,, I hope Israeli aircraft are already in the air to wipe out what the US was too gutless to do themselves.
@DirectingTitan Fo sho.
@DirectingTitan Can't understand the problem without all viewpoints and can't fix it if you don't understand the problem.
@DirectingTitan I'm truly not trying to harass you. But I'll take your viewpoint and factor it into how I view and debate this topic.


Obama and Kerry should have negotiated 9 pennies for $1. THAT would have been a better deal than this one. Quite the legacy.
@Haudricourt The Gold Glover Parra, who has started 118 games in CF (29 starts in '13 with a 16.8 UZR/150), wouldn't be an adequate backup?
@DirectingTitan  for when these guys piss away their fortunes &amp; are looking for more $. I cannot abide by that reasoning in voluntary sports
@DirectingTitan a player is uninformed--- insinuates that the NFL could have done more, or is liable, &amp; thus financially responsible  3
@DirectingTitan  --  Anyone that plays football or boxes understands the risks involved &amp; are compensated accordingly. Saying that  2
@DirectingTitan I'll explain why I take exception to the word "uninformed". Players in the NFL have been given concussion training.  1
@DirectingTitan And tone can be tough to discern on here, but I'm not trying to be snotty, just trying to understand this thought process.
@DirectingTitan You didn't. You declared someone else uninformed. Again, Do you think he's informed on knee and ankle injuries &amp; prevention?
@DirectingTitan As opposed to world renowned brain trauma expert DTO? Do you think he's informed on knee and ankle injuries &amp; prevention?
@DirectingTitan  That's why I used the Dewey Decimal System in the example. He's a professional.
@DirectingTitan Doesn't mean he did. Which is why I'd advise against calling ppl ignorant &amp; uninformed in their professional field of choice
@DirectingTitan Cuz you're implying that a man that's been around football &amp; Drs his whole life is uninformed. He's informed &amp; doesn't care.
@DirectingTitan I'm sure you would take criticism about being uninformed on the Dewey Decimal System from Gronk with the same gusto.........
LRTs: Check out the positions on this guy I've spent some of the day tweeting with.

The fake laws are the most harmful.

I will treat all judicial decisions based on fiction like this.
@bossmanham Saying you don't recognize decisions by courts is hardly logic based. It's lunatic based.
@DirectingTitan Easy buddy. He actually plays the game. I'd hardly call them uninformed. He just doesn't care. A distinction for sure.
@bossmanham Good luck with that.
@bossmanham Crooked or not, it's the law of the (Indiana) land. Imagine if everyone treated judges' decisions like this? Can't pick &amp; choose
@bossmanham So they can get married? Which is what I said to begin with.
Almost done with the 2nd book of the Game of Thrones &amp; this Martin cat can make getting a bowl of cereal into a 29 chapter Magnum Opus.
@bossmanham ... let me ask this: Is it legal for two gay people to get married in IN?
@CuffyMeh ??= Nobel Peace Prize
@bossmanham Oh, I see. You're making a distinction between a law allowing it and one banning it.
@bossmanham The law was enacted in October of last year. You're saying gay couples CAN'T get married?
If gay people want to stick it to Indiana, they'll go there this weekend &amp; get married, as the law allows. That will show those bigots!
My boss just found an email from '06 &amp; it is saving us time + $ with an end user suddenly changing their specs. But Hillary can't save hers?
@justinjabs It sounds like it's incurable. I'd begin making your final arrangements.
@jrehor I'm hopeful, but Raji wasn't exactly lighting it up in 2013 either. He got shoved around &amp; that typically doesn't end once it starts
@jrehor No doubt. They work together. I would characterize them as adequate.
@jrehor GB gave up 119.9 YPG on the ground. Keeping Guion &amp; Raji makes the DL a strength?? For comparison, OAK was better per carry &amp; game.
@WisconsinGunner @SaraMechell I read agriculture takes up 80% of the water but their restrictions aren't required until 2020........
@JeffSimpson7 @RightWisconsin @ScottWalker Nobody is perfect :)
@JeffSimpson7 @RightWisconsin Nah, I just think he takes a view from his professional experience. Hard not to as a cop I would imagine.
@mcnetthj @KLNorvell @TheTopCynic @Erhine1 @SharpestJim @RealBenLund @ter2459 @KFCdemocrats_ They truly have lost their minds. Again.
@DUD6887 Pretty horrific loss to experience against the champs in their house. I agree with you, but you just don't forget that one.
@DUD6887 normally agree, but they should show that onside kick the 1st day of every training camp. Do Your Job.
The saddest thing about this whole mess isn't the death threats. Always a few bad apples. It's the condoning of the threats by good apples!
@RightWisconsin Love Clarke but this is a false choice!! The same logic is applied to government surveillance. Rights are so darn pesky.
I'm glad we've moved on to a pizzeria now. Not everyone knows where two bakeries are but everyone knows many places to buy a pizza.
@Bobacheck right? These people are insane and it's only getting worse.
@Bobacheck &amp; how about the death threats?? Disagreeing is fine. Courts decide lawsuits. But threatening to kill someone over a pizza?
That's a nice 12 pointer though. #bucks
@WinksThinks but what about the Mecca M??
@AceofSpadesHQ @Adamizer1 HIM??? AoS, you woman hater!!
Indiana is so intolerant of gay people that they actually passed a law that allows gay marriage. The heathens! #boycottindiana
Great tweet. RT @brianhurn: @bradleystein @fakedansavage Someone heard about the 80/20 rule, but they're doing it wrong.
It's almost as if the word tolerance has evolved to mean, "I will tolerate your opinion ONLY if I agree with it".
Hey look at all of the tolerance to a principle our country was founded on, religious freedom. 
I see updates about Senator Menendez's indictment, but no party ID attached. HOPEFULLY BY NOW ALL OF YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS!!!
@JohnEkdahl @allahpundit Coexisted?
@AndyTarnoff It's good to see you guys are finally starting to recover from my departure. LULZ.
@AndyTarnoff Lots of people seem to like this side of OMC. I haven't seen any negativity on my feed either.
@AndyTarnoff I think it's your calling card. But in my view, it's too bad criticism for the city has to pigeon holed into 1 day a year.
@ChuckCJohnson Any idea how many companies/individuals will be getting waivers? I wonder how many political contributors will get a waiver?
Quite possibly the biggest farce of an administration full of farces is that Lois Lerner isn't sitting in jail awaiting trial. Ridiculous.
@RobSchroeder12 It's weird. The Bible says a lot of things, but some only pick out what they like &amp; applies to them. Happens a lot in life.
@RobSchroeder12 Personally, I think you should have the right to refuse service to anyone, anytime for any reason when you own a business.
@RobSchroeder12 Not limited to Christianity. In some countries, you can be killed for just being gay. Easier to demonize ppl here for votes.
I'll have to find out if these guys are still in business. Only a few miles from my house. 
I'd be interested in knowing who's holding a waiver with California's new water control measures.
@iowahawkblog Republican overreach!!
Not liking one's religion &amp; shutting down their business because of that religion seems to contradict a nation founded on religious freedom.
Twitter came along &amp; suddenly knowledge was definitively linked to followers. Misinformation became prevalent &amp; we're all more stupid.
I used to HATE talking politics w/  ppl due to a big dislike of ppl w/ no clue. Then folks stated to listen to these ppl &amp; forced my hand.
Just can't imagine willingly paying someone that hates me to make a cake to help celebrate the biggest day of my life. #Nonsensical
A NBA HOFer &amp; 6 time MVP that can't get a job in the NBA is now a trusted political pundit? Uh.... OK.
Sorry Ryan Braun, millions of people lie to cover their ass everyday and protect their reputation. You aren't in select company.
Why would ppl RT a @DRUDGE_REPORT tweet without a link? That's the ultimate 'decision making based on a headline' example I can think of.
@paigelav @geoffembler You should have gone with the 'I was hacked" excuse. But I guess we'll all pretend you meant to go after a Dem Gov.
The thing is going to be a damn albatross &amp; I will HAMMER those that supported this steaming turd. Then I'll be blocked for being right.
They want to expand the streetcar route that hasn't even been built yet and that was approved without a referendum.
@MadMaxDownUnder @Enrico_Palazzo_ I respect his opinion &amp; he has shown to have flexibility &amp; humbleness when wrong. SO MANY can't do that.
My favorite line: "We don’t police thought-crime, organize protests, smash windows or demand these people be fired. We change the channel"
Great piece here about principles &amp; mindset. This explains how an atheist like me can support religious freedom. 
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @MadMaxDownUnder You're far too hairy to be my wife.
@redsteeze Fo sho. Your piece basically explains how an atheist like me can stand up for religious freedom due to conservative principles.
@redsteeze Good line- We don’t police thought-crime, organize protests, smash windows or demand these people be fired. We change the channel
More likely, they are bitter enemies that use whatever pawns (kids, voters) are at their disposal.
I'm trying to imagine a marriage where one side gets to call the other a bigot whenever a disagreement arises. How long are they partners?
Should a baker sell what is in the display counter to anyone? YES.
Should a baker be forced to make something against their religion? NO.
@IgnitorKid 90.
@IgnitorKid well, the Crew is going to be good this year so I imagine I won't have much to say.
@IgnitorKid Packing bags? Forwarding mail?
Disconnecting electricity?
Saying goodbye?
@IgnitorKid As an attendee of that game, I'm hoping Doug Melvin begged a thousand pardons.
@10iskristin I'm on vacation next week...
@10iskristin the beginning of the season &amp; the playoffs have the best matchups. It's going to be great.
@Sunbird5274 He'll be alright, even if he does catch one in the old onion bag.
@Sunbird5274 The word Sunnie shouldn't be in that tweet. And Jake will vow never forget that cup again right after he needs it.
And yet Ben Hendrickson looks on longingly. RT @AdamMcCalvy: Neal Cotts this spring: 7ip, 18h, 11er, 6bb, hbp, wp.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Right, but those boosters are still there. Rearranging the deck chairs doesn't change that deep rooted culture.
Now we all know what the Ath Dir of a known cheater like USC thinks about a morality issue. Like getting advice on safes from prison inmates
@MiltownBucky The implications are from perceptions, not from self descriptions.
@MiltownBucky And I imagine if Waukesha had a suburban radio movement, it would be classified as racist in 2.2 seconds.
@MiltownBucky Like V100?
@MiltownBucky Never, but that sounds racist &amp; non-inclusive. Is my kind welcome there? I guess I have separate, but equal, ones to enjoy.
@we_agnes @botticellicream Sounds like you're not their target audience. Your reading comprehension betrays you.
@MiltownBucky What;s urban comedy? How does it differ from rural comedy? Never heard of that term before.
Iran got an extra day for the nuke deal. Longface must have said NO to 1 of their 50 demands.
@JeffSimpson7 Lots of folks sitting on their arse that will eat today should be thanking me, including Walker.
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow I also donate a TON of tax dollars. Funny how some forget about that part.
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow Gerrymander?
My guy, @MilwaukeeLDogg trains at Red Schafer's here in MKE &amp; has been calling out @CMPunk for quite some time. Why not do it?
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow And all I've been doing for 4 years besides paying attention is voting for winners.
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow All you're doing is crying about something BOTH do. You're mad now cuz you're on the flip side
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow The illegal activity you are describing here with secrecy agreements. Unless.....
That said, I wish @BrianCarriveau the best and look forward to the new gig.
I read @BrianCarriveau religiously, despite CHTV using a terrible green background that messes with my eyes. CD is all that's left there.
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow Can't wait to read about it in the criminal complaint. Other than that, it's just a fairy tale
@Deanofcomedy Do you think a male comedian could send out a tweet about slanted Asian eyes and get away with it?
Remember when it was revealed that Hillary deleted all of her emails? She's counting on you NOT remembering.  #RepublicanOverreach
Maybe Apple can help justify their move in Saudi Arabia by comparing the rights of gays and women to Indiana? Crazy I have to tweet this.
@BarneyFranken Image a sports team making the team captain the one guy NO ONE trusts to tell the truth?
@JeffSimpson7 @SchachtNathan @onewisconsinnow Thanks for highlighting what a partisan issue gerrymandering is. Dems would NEVER EVER attempt
@ReviewngTheBrew Yeah, we'd have to see a true take home profit total. Numbers are easily bendable &amp; owner gets 1/2.
I changed my browser today to Duck Duck Go. I bet they haven't been to the White House over 200x in the last year &amp; they don't track info.
Case in point: 
How the heck is that 2nd Asian tweet not racist and a fire-able offense??
@ReviewngTheBrew Right, I think they are all set up differently. I think I remember reading some are non-profit.
As folks dig through the treasure trove of #TrevorNoah tweets, good advice is to not tweet, if you care what people say &amp; think afterwards.
@ReviewngTheBrew I'm not versed in revenue numbers/structure for minor league teams. Nobody is perfect.
@ReviewngTheBrew No, I get paid a salary &amp; if I do my job well, I make a big bonus. I've never worked a sales job without a livable salary.
@ReviewngTheBrew Why would someone need govt assistance if they chose that living? Isn't govt assistance for those with no other options?
@ReviewngTheBrew How about minor league players split whatever is left from their minor league teams after all expenses, like a normal job?
@ReviewngTheBrew THERE IT IS. Took 10 tweets for you to finally get to it. You think they deserve a fair share. LULZ.
@ReviewngTheBrew I can appreciate your view, but I think it's wrong to try to make minor league baseball into a career. It's an investment.
@ReviewngTheBrew Japanese leagues, Korean Leagues, Mexican Leagues, Europe, Taiwan? Tons of leagues. Also, non-compete clauses exist.
@ReviewngTheBrew AND THEY CHOSE TO ACCEPT A LIFE IN THE MINORS. To me, this is a similar debate to student loans/paying college athletes.
@ReviewngTheBrew And they get ALL of the other 6 months off. It's not a stand alone job. Never has been.
@ReviewngTheBrew Well, I spend 1-1/2 hrs getting to/from my job each day. Salesman spends HOURS getting to where they make $. Part of gig
@ReviewngTheBrew How so? Their job is 3 hrs/day. Traveling salesman don't include driving time &amp; ppl don't include gym time to their hrs.
The Rolling Stones Summerfest show will include free samples of Metamucil &amp; Ensure plus feature FREE rascal rides to your seats.
Does not compute. RT @10iskristin: "too much baseball" that doesn't even make sense
LRT: not going to see a finer tweet than that for quite some time.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ @themeiz @WhatRUTinkin @DrunkLaRussa I feel Eaton Boxberger is a strong effort in this league.
@themeiz @IgnitorKid at least we can all be happy that racism/sexism/sex preference won't factor into this debate. It's like the only one.
@IgnitorKid but what you NEVER see is a sportswriter discussing how the bargaining agreement screwed an owner in one very limited aspect.
@htenenbaum I don't see how ppl that aren't self sufficient can exist without it. Well, in a free world.
Cakes vs nukes. I know which story actually matters &amp; which one everyone is talking about. To me, it's apalling.
@IgnitorKid Welcome to Twitter. Take a moment to look around &amp; familiarize yourself with the surroundings.
@dexhandle I think that would be the point...  it's just an opinion that they have. I mean, it hasn't really happened, ever.
@WisconsinGunner yep
@dexhandle " hints most strongly". Thank you for linking an editorial from historically even handed Atlantic.
The NFLPA would have been the perfect entity to negotiate deals with the American Indian in the early 1800s.
@WisconsinGunner But yeah, when it at $800- $900 a crash seemed inevitable after such a meteoric rise.
@WisconsinGunner Well, I remember when @D______o______M was upset he didn't get in at $60 when it was $120ish. Bunch of us discussing early.
@jlwoj I'm aware of the big hub bub of gamergate, but that isn't my thing. I try to stick to what I know.
@jlwoj @ReviewngTheBrew My bad, Quite difficult to discern that from those 7 words. Please carry on.
@ReviewngTheBrew @jlwoj Is it a question of ethics if it was negotiated, mutually agreed to and has been done by clubs since the inception?
That series of MLBPA tweets is akin to a co-worker showing up for work &amp; blaming someone else for how they dressed.
@justinjabs They're crying about an aspect of an agreement they themselves bargained &amp; agreed to. The term is called sour grapes.
@WisconsinGunner Sitting at $250. That's good profit from a year ago &amp; I think I read Wall St is interested, which could reduce volatility.
@htenenbaum @umairh If not $, what would you use to barter for goods &amp; services? Unless we're expecting city ppl to grow their own food?
Did you ever notice how reporters never bring up things in the NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement that really hurt the owners?
I just crumpled up a piece of paper and missed the wastebasket from 18". #Athlete
@MarkWohlers Had to drown out the crickets somehow. Those things get loud when echoing in a dome.
Now this nitwit has deleted her "I was hacked" tweet. Maybe she should just grab a dunce hat and head for the corner to sit a spell.
@GayPatriot Thx. I was hoping he saw my 2nd response before blocking me. Luckily he did. Welcome aboard!
@GayPatriot  It was a joke! You's have to see my 2nd tweet to lachlan to know that.
@timcyoung Yep and don't forget factoring in the race of the speaker to determine if it is racism, even if they say the EXACT same words.
@timcyoung I don't have a dog in the fight so it's easy to see how differently this country now treats Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
@lachlan Sorry, Lachlan. My Twitter feed was just hacked. I've started an investigation into what happened. Please excuse me.
@lachlan TYPICAL CONJECTURE FROM A GUY THAT SUPPORTS NAZIS AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE.
@timcyoung VERY GOOD.
You expose yourself to history's long and perfect memory when you fall all over yourself to heap praise on Ted Kennedy.
@BklynMiddleton @botticellicream An act of terror is an action associated with right wing extremism. Religious lone wolves need not apply.
@AndyTarnoff Lots of hype! At this point, anything short of revealing the location of Noah's Arc or who killed JFK will be a letdown.
It appears to me that over the weekend, one side of the RFRA debate was outraged and the other was doing their homework.
@MiltownBucky @Enrico_Palazzo_ They're all different, like each level of baseball use a BASEBALL but the stitching &amp; core are all different.
@MiltownBucky @Enrico_Palazzo_ PSSSST: The same folks that used states' rights in that way are the same one telling you about this law.
@MiltownBucky @Enrico_Palazzo_ Oh, I think there is most definitely some knot twisting going on. But not the way you think.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Please just read this. Nearly every point you make is refuted &amp; better yet, explained. 
@BrianCarriveau @caplannfl Will he have to open a bank account or will it all fit into his trunk??
@Enrico_Palazzo_ That's not true. The govt’s has to fail to prove their interest is compelling for that to happen.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ Again, It can’t be used affirmatively to try and deprive others of the protections of law.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ You're trying to characterize the other 19 as being the same and Indiana different. That's not the case. Each is different
Yes, Mr. Smith. your 10th grade education will work perfectly for our organization. Here's your protest sign, get out there and rage.
@Enrico_Palazzo_  In '97, SCOTUS held that fed govt lacked authority to impose RFRA on states. Have to pass their own, which 20 have done.
@MiltownBucky @Enrico_Palazzo_ " hints most strongly". I guess this phrase sums up the entire editorial quite nicely.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ That quote came from the Federalist article I posted earlier.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ "Notably, despite the lack of such a law, nobody can point to any Indiana businesses that were discriminating against gays"
This whole #BoycottIndiana nonsense is an elaborate ruse to keep folks that aren't educated on topics, protesting them. Works on stupid ppl.
Christ, Hillary's husband signs the same federal law + Obama voted to approve the same law in his state, yet we're boycotting.
As you do your Monday reading about RFRAs, just remember who on Friday was tweeting in hysterics and who was tweeting cold hard facts.
I'd be interested in reading some analysis on some of the best halves players have ever had in a regional final. Dekker killed it.
Back to Back Final 4s for Bo Ryan is pretty darn impressive.
Notre Dame must be one of the best teams ever. Otherwise, that would mean that Kentucky is.....
@NPetrashek Hyatt is picking me up in 10 minutes. I'm half in the bag,
@Sam_Kluender Words uttered by many but fulfilled by few.
@Sam_Kluender Oh.....
@Sam_Kluender 
@Sam_Kluender Are you in the Drunk LaRussa league??
@wallypingel @MiltownBucky Ya. They suck and he invited it by doing so on Twitter. No one wins except Maryland.
I think a safe place to be in a political argument is being opposed to whatever Miley Cyrus thinks.
@timcyoung I mean, I'm more just psyched about the staff. Even though it's free, the TSL is always a point of pride with me.
@timcyoung Perez Pujols Murphy Bogaerts Arenado,Joey Bats, Hamilton, Heyward, Melky, Arcia Semien Baez Butler Dyson Norris
@timcyoung haha. Thank you. Ok, here are the hitters.
@ajknick Yep. All great places. But I must say, (kinda gross) that I had a sinus cold in London once. BLACK snot is not cool
THAT is how you subtweet.
My top 5 cities I've been to: 1) Venice 2) Bergen, Norway 3) Prague 4) Edinburgh, Scotland 5) Xian, China.
I'll always have a special place in my heart for the many, many cities all over the world that I visited as a sales rep for a tour operator.
It's a quiet Friday night in SUBTWEET CENTRAL.
@justinjabs @Metallica ONE
@timcyoung King Felix, Strasburg, deGrom, Ventura, T Walker, Paxton, Chapman, C Allen, Giles, W Davis.
@timcyoung Grade my 12 team My Tweet Smack League staff: 5 x 5
@AndyTarnoff He wouldn't waste his time on a nobody like me. And war is poor. I just like to discuss.
@AndyTarnoff That's not fair to him. All I'll say is that my Brewers/Packers stuff is much closer to his than his politics is to mine.
The lady wipes her server and gets rewarded with the Presidency? Nah. I'd even back Chieftain Warren over her.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ TWSS
Ugh. Welp. Pick up some more 3 stars and keep churning out Sweet 16s.
@RobSchroeder12 3 minutes!!
Exciting to finally find out if Wisconsin lands Diamond Stone. Kid seems legit.
@AndyTarnoff I've followed him for a long time &amp; he's fine but was way over his skis today. I pointed out the 3 ring echo chamber circus.
@AndyTarnoff 
@IgnitorKid Lots of those, lots of walking and lots of swings in the cage.
The wife and kids just left for the weekend. I'll somehow try to trudge on.
@TamraTellsIt Have a great weekend!
@TamraTellsIt No matter who wins it, I'm tired of having the nominee be the first choice liberals would pick out of a lineup.
@FRHYSB Damn dude. OK, I tried. Have a great weekend,
Lots of hot takes on the Amanda Knox verdict that are accompanied with very little knowledge of the Italian judicial system.
@FRHYSB we're looking for another guy in the 35+. Practice tomorrow at 13th &amp; Rawson from 2-4. I can get you in, then it's up to you.
@AndyTarnoff But what I said was true, correct? Might as well add degrees in poly sci &amp; history too, which is pretty good for a child.
@DougRussell eh... I'll just cc: @AndyTarnoff. Andy will vouch for me.
@DougRussell That's probably why OMC has paid me to blog politics in the past. I know what I'm talking about.
@DougRussell Not by me. By the story. I really had to point this out? And this child will feed you your lunch in a political debate.
Give me a 5 mins convo &amp; I'll have even the staunchest supporter of Progressivism agreeing that Indiana can pass whatever laws they please.
That's the sad state of educated political discourse in this country.
We got Russell outraged, Trenni asking what the difference between IN &amp; the other states &amp; someone else saying they can't find it on Google.
I swear, it's like watching the local sports guy grab a blackboard &amp; write 2+2= 5 &amp; then promptly share his vast mathematical expertise.
SO please, PLEASE, remember these tweets when the local sports moron with no political knowledge starts discussing this. They're clueless!!
It's like the first thing you learn about the Civil War in terms of states' rights. But I doubt you get that lesson in a 3 min Google search
Again, if you feel Calif has a right to pass abortion legislature, then you MUST, YOU MUST, support Indiana's right to also pass legislation
@DougRussell You're missing the political point. Do you support Indiana having a right to pass a law similar to 19 states &amp; the fed govt?
But the best thing is when someone consults Google, reads for 4 minutes, then debates a topic they has no knowledge about 5 minutes ago!
@samy45  You must HATE the federal version of the exact same law Bill Clinton signed in 1993, that 19 other states have also adopted?
@Kevin_Swiontek Well done. Couldn't have said it better myself.
Another example would be ppl agreeing with California passing liberal abortion laws, but opposing other states for passing restrictive ones.
How would laws ever have a benchmark if we subjected them to personal feelings? It's either their right to make laws, or it isn't.
If you support Indiana passing laws independent of the fed govt, then you can't choose which ones you support based on personal feelings.
@Kevin_Swiontek I'm trying to educate the local sports guy but I'm guessing his tweets weren't for discussion but to pat himself on the back
@DougRussell laws or not.You can't just pick which ones you support, that's not how the system works. Principles vs personal politics.
@DougRussell If Indiana signed a bill outlawing this practice, you'd support it? That's the problem., Either states have a right to pass
@DougRussell  So he's thinking like an 2x elected POTUS. But let's not let facts get in the way of emotional hysterics.
@DougRussell 1) 20th state to enact. 2) Modeled after federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which President Bill Clinton signed in 1993
@suscitate @botticellicream A proven free market solution? I see a Problem: No victim &amp; no one to blame, in order to gain political capital.
@ATown_Andy Ya. The faux outrage isn't at all about a cake or some rigid set of principles and that's the part that always bothers me.
@ATown_Andy Sort of like requiring a Jewish baker to bake a cake with a swastika on it, or a Muslim baker to bake a cake with bacon in it.
That damn dog will not go away. Ever.
@FRHYSB Was that you that was looking to play baseball? Can't remember for sure.
WHy are these people in charge so afraid to call an act terrorism? What are the terrorists going to do, besides already commit terror acts?
LRT: When someone handcuffs themselves to an object, the proper response is to leave them there for a week.
@timkmak @botticellicream If she had brought some beer and hookers, the Secret Service would be shutting down the street to PARTY instead.
@Sunbird5274 Yep, him too. Don't have enough flags to honor heroes.
@Sunbird5274 Are they half staff for that state trooper?
@YoungBLKRepub @billpostmus I don't recall ISIS being requested to appear AFTER a law is broken.
@Enrico_Palazzo_ We talk like this all of the time. It was a Twitter convo that didn't tag anyone. She wore a shirt that featured BOOBS.
@dj_gswizzle Cue victim shaming excuse makers. 
\
Now two guys have to give apologies they don't mean to someone who had it coming, all in the name of equality &amp; feminism..... or something
In summary: Don't dress like a skank and folks won't oogle and objectify you like a skank. Pretty simple stuff here.
This is like a man going to work in a speedo with a MASSIVE bulge and then being offended people are looking/commenting on the bulge.
If you don't want people making comments about your boobs, don't wear an outfit with 5" of cleavage showing. Can't have it both ways ladies.
Harry Reid retiring is like a 1991 Plymouth Horizon retiring.
@jrehor Those that stir the poop pot should have to lick the spoon!
@TamraTellsIt Why are they profiting off his death? They cared so much about him &amp; mental illness that they left him on the streets, alone.
So, violate one's right to illegal search on 25th &amp; Capitol is racist but having the govt do so on a computer is COOL. #PrinciplesVsPolitics
A hilarious stance by folks NOT wanting a north side frisking policy in Milw is supporting a POTUS who electronically frisks everyone, daily
Has nothing whatsoever to do with one party willing to abandon their principles to use entitlements as a bribe for votes. #Progressives101
But we'll stick with the story that the GOP fought for minority rights for 150 yrs but suddenly &amp; magically became racists.
Couldn't possibly be that Carter was so incompetent that Reagan's actual recovery appealed to those that value liberty &amp; self sufficiency.
I'd say Reagan's 8 yrs of prosperity turned the south Republican. Of course, Dems leaned on their big city minority base to claim racism...
LRT: Lots of history illiterates claim there was a magical switch of the Civil Rights GOP &amp; racist Dems. Wasn't happening by 1980.
@lachlan Don't shave the night before, yawn, look down, show up dressed for Florida or complain about a 45 minute line. Got it.
The Brewers officials claiming the new security measures are minimally inconvenient don't have to stand in 20 minute lines themselves....
Yesterday I kept thinking all day it was Friday. Today, I'm all better.
What kind of religion has one drive a plane into the side of a mountain? Allegedly.
@redsteeze @Wisco In these parts, that will get him every time.
@KrisLBurke @jrehor You two clowns should stick to football and not geography.
@MadMaxDownUnder @Barton1331 I don't have cable, so I don't watch much basketball these days. I used to really like basketball.
@MadMaxDownUnder @Barton1331 I call them days, Pre- Danny Jones. I'd sit up on Sat nights until 10:30 to watch PBS replays of bad teams.
@Barton1331 Great topic to be discussing!!
@Barton1331 Last year, this year
@Barton1331 2 elite 8s
Amazing how far the badgers have come in 20 years. Back to back elite 8s.
North Carolina played about as well as a team could &amp; it wasn't good enough when free throws mattered.
BURN! RT @Enrico_Palazzo_: It's ok North Carolina, you'll be vacating these tourney wins soon enough
I think the turning point was Bo leaving Showalter in after the timeout. He gave a spark they didn't have.
Confirmed. RT @dj_gswizzle: Dekker is a freaking baller
Frank acted like he got shot &amp; the announcer said he got slapped.
Would like to see Frank pop that 3. Get hot burying a few of those &amp; he'll be fine.
@WinksThinks You're right, tonight there's a whole new bench.
@themeiz Never a better time to end that perception.
@themeiz Been the talk all week around my office.
Brad Nelson waves. RT @10iskristin: I don't care if it's only spring training, the Brewers offense has been impressive lately.
Timehop is reminding me that 2 years ago, beat writers were repeating the company line on Yuni while fans were losing their minds.
Oh, you confused mere insurance with actual healthcare?

*pats voter on the head*
@mcnetthj Let me consult my race outrage formula: 

Cop White? Victim black?  

I'm sorry, the formula says these black lives don't matter.
@illinoispolicy @Public_Ade Sure do. But I bet the problem isn't first time offenders. Also, Cook County judges are easy on gun sentences.
@illinoispolicy @Public_Ade Have anyone suggested NOT BREAKING THE LAW TO BEGIN WITH?? 100% chance of success.
@AndyTarnoff Agreed.
@AndyTarnoff Pretty sure a lack of an Asian pavilion wasn't the reason it closed. Nobody wants to shop in an unsafe dilapidated neighborhood
Maybe the reason women make 77% (allegedly) is because their excuses and fall back positions are akin to their dog eating their homework.
Police officers have microaggressions of law breaking and trigger warnings of someone going for their gun.
I'll post this here since Facebook won't allow it to be posted. Go ahead and try.The very definition of irony.  
Look what I found. Paragraph 4 is a must read. 
@AceofSpadesHQ I think these fact checkers might have missed here.  
@jrios68 I like his profile description of politics since 2011. This is why some many look like idiots when jumping in the stream waist deep
$50 to have Ron Wolf scribble some nonsense on some old crap you saved.

In fact, we're going to borrow $ from China to continue to fund these asinine agencies. Then blame the Tea Party for saying NO MORE.
