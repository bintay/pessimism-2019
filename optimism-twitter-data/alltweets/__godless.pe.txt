Just want to say Ducky is the fucking MAN.
@unclegarysgirl dude
I'm so bored.
Can't wait for the Old Wounds record release in July. I hope @StarneyBinson dead beats my face in.
@StarneyBinson hell yeah
Marilyn Manson brought back Lunchbox and Cake and Sodomy. Yo July couldn't come faster. I'll be a wreck.
At least that's the goal. If that's all that I amount to or that I inspire people with. That's awful and it sucks.
One day I'll be seen as more than someone who "listens to cool music".

At least I have good company in hell
Kill me
@Katie_Barreto Actually the best thing on this eartg
@Katie_Barreto I love you<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I don't feel 22. For some reason I feel that those graduating are older than me and they're not. It sucks. I just don't feel this old.
@jmpezzano1 See you tomorrow<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@smvitiello Everything is sketchy until Eric doesn't throw up<WHITE SMILING FACE>️

@smvitiello I mean you're talented at complaining. #butwestillloveyou
@jimhammcbride What the fuck. I hate people that buy expensive drinks and act like they're not just milkshakes.
@yosupaaronheard @JuelzB4Swine @BacktrackNYHC this sounds like a true sight to have been seen.

@xtaylormadisonx The new record is really good man.
@MinaCaputo <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Cannot express how much Life of Agony means to me. Special thanks to @MinaCaputo and the boys for getting me through college<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@jesskardos44 @IRockThe732 color me disappointed now.
NO HOPE.
RIVER RUNS RED.
<HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL> miserable.
Didn't know you liked that ha
@xdrainmex sounds like a good one! 
I feel like slappys on red slanted curbs are cheating.
And it didn't even start<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I'm done with school. I'm done with people. I'm done with life and I'm done with finals. Holy fuck I hate this week.
People are fucking incredible let me tell you.
Is there something wrong with me? When did I become this empty?
@CFeenz Best.
@CFeenz I'm seeing The Used in two weeks and I'm freaking out man.
@CFeenz I am not <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@smvitiello I knew it. Can't resist #Kevins lips 
This is the sickest venue.
@ColinYovng I lied just saw the other dude say that haha
@ColinYovng Faith No More
It's weird seeing people you came into college with graduating while you still have a semester left. How are you supposed to feel about that
I wanna start shaving my legs. I'm gonna do it.
@WhatSerendipity @KaleighMae Jesus Christ.
@Nick_Palermo_ I'm getting this tattoo'd on me.
@murderoflife I could not agree with this more if I tried.

Bruce Jenner is fucking cool. Hell yeah.
@NicoZeppilli I love you too baby boy
Black Sabbath is the god damn greatest.
Yo if I could not live a "negative" life I totally would. People are dumb.
HAHAHAHA
@LoganOlvera hell yeah it is. And with relationships being a part of it it's hard. A lot of work and effort goes into them from each side!
@LoganOlvera This ain't no Lifetime movie! Life is hard and things don't always work perfectly!
@eromadnonnahs @StarneyBinson HAHAHA
@eromadnonnahs I'm having the same problem.
@KillPatricG I love you
@lumpyspacepug old*
@lumpyspacepug that was the only stencil! :)
I'm miserable but this is so great 
@marilynmanson I'm getting your face on me today. I love you.
HAHAHAHAHA
Humans are disgusting and I am no exception.
I'm so miserable it's actually funny.
I want to punch myself in the face 100% of the time.
@raychel_austyn know you enough that you called me dude everyday last year<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@raychel_austyn 100% false.
Looking in the mirror and seeing yourself and being extremely unhappy with your life is easily the worst feeling humanly possible.
@darbyhalbomxo23 fuck you
Miss/love @StarneyBinson and @smvitiello
@tina_galdi I actually LOLd
Shout out to @fearfullyfierce 's ex for being a complete loser.

I'm so excited to see @unclegarysgirl
Someone come hang with me on my shift and watch me devour an entire pizza while listening to shitty music.
Set It Off, a true New York masterpiece.
This is already the worst day of my life and it hasn't even started yet.
Empty through and through.
@KaleighMae @espn #mvp

Burzum
@tsmith_wav fair enough my man!
The intro to Cult from Slayer is the hardest and heaviest thing I have ever heard.
@helloiamamerica such a classic
Paradise Lost has forever fucked Sanitarium for me. Seeing those crime scene photos with that playing is terrifying.
@KaleighMae @k8amodei hell yaaa
@Katie_Barreto of course!
@Katie_Barreto Oh 100%
Also. Third Eye Blind's S/T is just what I need today
@Falafelknight That was such a great day. Hopefully soon my friend!

ALSO LOVE @k8amodei and @KaleighMae FOR IGNORING ME LAST NIGHT<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
I love Tori Amos, I love Jack Off Jill and I love females who kick any males ass in rock. Fuck yeah.
@JOJ_official is playing one show in July and I just may have to take the trip from Jersey to NC for it.
@toriamos re-issues come out today and it feels like Christmas morning.
Yo @k8amodei and @KaleighMae let's get coffee soon <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@BOMBXTARRETO @ronmaiden69
Sarah bought me this and I'm so happy. I lost my copy from when I was in 6th grade and I'm estatic to have it again

@aaronschwarzz @DunkinDonuts Woah man let's relax here. You're outta line/write a song about it.
Some one dookied in the urinal. 
"You're like Santa Claus on Prozac at Disney World getting laid"
@charlie_kupilik you have to play "caught in a mosh" every time you walk in a room.
@MinaCaputo seeing videos of tonight makes me so excited. River runs in Brooklyn May 1st<VICTORY HAND>️<SMILING FACE WITH HORNS>
@elenadestories you and @smvitiello go to the same school and like all the same cool shit. Be friends and let's all get food eventually <WHITE SMILING FACE>️

@megbcorio honeys dead.
I've almost bought this six times and need to just honestly do it. 
And she just found a worse one.
Bri has been waiting for this dude to leave his spot for almost 15 minutes.
One Direction fans are weird.
@KaleighMae Always good seeing you too friend!

That new Superheaven song is flawless.
Love the world that won't love you back.

@StarneyBinson p l e a s e
@CReyRocks I love you.
I don't want to be in school and I want to yell things into a microphone for a living.
@CReyRocks miss you more homie
This kid is getting straight ripped hahaha
@jackie_reese I'll give you any amount of money to punch me right now <HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL>
This one kid in this stupid ass meeting is so fucking annoying. I would do anything for one free punch.
I'd rather listen to Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar than any other band or record.
@ryanngriffith @mattwhipple_ Korn, Coal Chamber and Deftones too!
@mattwhipple_ I mean if it makes people listen to music I'm all for it. It's not affecting me!
@mattwhipple_ Hell no dude. I've been listening to that since I was a kid! Too sick to give up.
@stephcolesays Starland!
As much as I hate Ronnie Radke. I'm 100% going to see Dying Is Your Latest Fashion front to back.
@KillPatricG hot*
@_ch0kingvictim Me and you both friend!
"Phoebe's making people"
Besides that. If they do your again I hope they forget everything they wrote after 2006.
I can't wait until you don't care about them next week ha ha ha
Half of you that are excited about my chemical romance are the same people who would've beat me up in middle school for liking them ha ha ha
@michaelmiracco I love you.
@twtchngtongues That new Manson record was brilliant. Very excited to see that in the playlist!


GO BEAT YOURSELVES TO DEATH.
@M_Gooney This is great for 2 reasons haha.

@mattwhipple_ <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@murderoflife 1,000,000% support this.
HAHAH SOMEONE END ME RIGHT NOW.
I QUIT
On that note. T-shirts are the best. Clubs suck. Nice clothes suck and life of agony is the best hardcore band of all time. Fuck you.
@unclegarysgirl MY. MAN.
@BOMBXTARRETO @Katie_Barreto I love you too<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
This your world in which we grow, and we will grow to hate you.
You reap what you sew.
I'm not the only one that feels this way.
Extremely thankful for @BOMBXTARRETO and @Katie_Barreto
@BOMBXTARRETO can we hang out.
@alexhalper For fucks sake
@truelovecrew reckless.
So far Marcel is the only character I like.
@ColinYovng It gets 100% better. Mr. Heckles is rad too though.
@werefusetosink @john_bazley ^
I guess today's the day where almost everyone ignores me<SQUARED COOL>
@smvitiello text me.
@smvitiello Ain't nothing wrong with that!
Nonstop Feeling is really something else. <FIRE>/10
I need a milkshake. @charlie_kupilik
@xjoepezzx made something super cool that you all should go watch. 
Why is Burzum is the hashtags? 
@bosxe If it makes you feel any better, I think it's insane dude. You all did such a good job.
Someone kill me.
I'm broken.
@BOMBXTARRETO @Katie_Barreto @mike_barreto @Rebuildd NEXT SUNDAY
Hey @Katie_Barreto @BOMBXTARRETO @mike_barreto @Rebuildd I'm home<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@DylbyODonnell I know man. I NEED to be more careful:(((
@courtneykracht miss you too friend!
@courtneykracht I mean he was close, right?
@TheDongSide @TropDontTweet this is insanely accurate.
@kelseycohan I love that shit.
@StarneyBinson drive up here and let's go to vintage.
Someone go to vintage with me and get me out of this house.
@mattwhipple_ @murderoflife you know me! I like everything so I just said another 7" that's incredible.
@murderoflife right next to Burn.
I'm going to smack @michaelmiracco
“@TheThirdPew: Look what you've done @IGGYAZALEA 
“@NBCNews: JUST IN: Judge declares mistrial in sentencing of convicted killer Jodi Arias 
@angmeoww @rrjeu happy birthday dudes!
Dead to the world.
Except for the amount of Paramore and Buried Alive in going to listen to on my shift.
Everything can fuck off tonight.
The amount of miserable I'm at is incredible.
@CFeenz fucking do it!
@CFeenz @JacobbManellaa MY MAN
Supertouch
Burn me alive.
@CFeenz 
Beat me into oblivion.
YOU'VE SEALED YOUR FATE. 
@garbage if this means you're playing you're debut in full, color me so excited I can't function.
Save your prayers and solve your problems with your fist.
I feel dead.
@murderoflife I feel you dude. 
@murderoflife tell myself the same thing everyday and then this happens 
@StarneyBinson @smvitiello @charlie_kupilik Eric. Yes.
@smvitiello @charlie_kupilik @StarneyBinson Psh we would run that place.
@charlie_kupilik @StarneyBinson can I wear this. 
@charlie_kupilik that sounds miserable. I'm so sorry.
@charlie_kupilik What else would you wear?
Dang I still wish I got that daylight hat.
@smvitiello @eromadnonnahs WHAT. GOD DAMN.
@XmawtinX Hahahahah
@eromadnonnahs YO YES
@eromadnonnahs THIS BETTER NOT BE A JOKE.
@charlie_kupilik @DeanCribbin I'm so down.
@rrjeu miss you too dude! Hope you're well too<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
That new @EternalSleephc is insane.
@smvitiello @Stephisalive 
@KillPatricG record*
@KillPatricG Agreed! There's still just something about that records.
Around the Fur is by far the best Deftones record.
I am so sick of literally everything. I'm so frustrated and angry it's annoying.
@xFALLCHILDx Very excited. Also, sex cross is brilliant.
@DeanCribbin next weekend for a week man!
@XmawtinX @bornin2thegrave @ZachxWalters @TurkeylegMaster HAHA
@aidannnwhite @XmawtinX @wavesofsorrow @CFeenz I said that last week haha.

Colin is going to kill me
@StarneyBinson What
@bornin2thegrave The best.
@CFeenz love you<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@XmawtinX glad I could support the cause<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@XmawtinX HAHAHA I KNEW IT
@bornin2thegrave black no. 1 baby.
I got called a try hard by the number one try hard. What a fucking idiot.
Your OG Bold shirts mean shit if you're a piece of garbage.
Call me a try hard all you want but at least I didn't spend thousands of dollars to make me into someone I'm not.
The only "hate" I'll ever support is the "Irresponsible Hate Anthem". Other than that hate is stupid. People are even dumber.
If I learned anything from this its that I love The Used more than I thought.
@jesskardos44 Not as bad as Paris Hilton.
@jesskardos44 awful peoplr
@jesskardos44 haha shit.
This is why I just listen to things that are 20 years old.
Well now that was extremely stupid.
@smvitiello I heard if you say "Robert Smith" into a mirror 3 times, he appears and gives you a new one.
@smvitiello they got your back. 
Even thought they recently played NJ and PA, I cannot wait for @codeorangekids to come back and melt my face off for a 4th time.
Waking up looking at some of my favorite things is such a good way to start any morning. 
Probably in my top ten of all time. 
@unclegarysgirl I can't say I wouldn't do the same.
Hysterian's EP is still in rotation three years later.
@mattwhipple_ <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Power Trip is in this new thrasher part. Tight.

@Northrunnerband is the best and their new EP is fucking sick.
I miss Milo more than I miss @Katie_Barreto
@codeorangekids is the future.
Breakin' my neck all night <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Winter Classic is on Saturday and so is my birthday. Cool.
The term "situational" makes me cringe inside.
@StarneyBinson We are soulmates.
No one will ever come for me.

#crying:/
@smvitiello so fucking dumb.
@smvitiello I've been calling around for it. So bummed.
@smvitiello the hot topic one?!
@smvitiello the worst people in the world.
@smvitiello I'm sure it'll be alright and I'll see you all and we can headbang to great bands!
PEOPLE = SHIT.
@smvitiello I'm so excited for this reunion!
You were from a perfect world. A world that threw me away today.
My nervous systems down.
Why am I shocked no one cares
I'm going back to living in my brain by myself. Reality was too cold. I'm sorry.
Alone.
@misssssyx I still hope everyone knows I mean that dearly!
Half of these kids buying the new nikes 100% have never listened to De La Soul. But they really should because they're so sick.
See you in May<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES> @MinaCaputo

@marek_kaczynski The absolute worst man.
However. Vans are sweet. Welcome, anti hero, and WKND are sweet. And Andrew Reynolds is god.
Street league sucks. Diamond sucks. And I wish Nike would get out of skateboarding and stop making awful shoes.
@charlie_kupilik coffee
@JackxHoward One of the most uncomfortable things in the world dude.

“@KatieBarretoxD: crying.:/” I will have this framed one day
@KatieBarretoxD @megbcorio ITS BACK
@Rebuildd Love you too<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

@BoxerNJ_Tyler @BoxerNJ I thought you hated hardcore?
Fucking stupid.
I'm so fucking miserable.
Jack Off Jill is so sick
Seeing Slipknot with @methaddicts. Couldn't ask for a better person to break my neck with <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Waiting for @unclegarysgirl to text me back 
Placebo is so underrated that it physically pains me.
@EarthToNicolee Oh shit text me!
who's good at using torrents and can help me out real fast?
I need food and coffee desperately
I'm currently numb. Sick.
OCD, Panic Disorder and a laundry list of others cripple many people I love and me included. But there's always a light. #BellLetsTaIk
The Pale Emperor is Manson's best record since Golden Age without a doubt.
@WeAreTheUsed what do I have to do to hear I'm A Fake at Sayerville? Regardless , I love you all<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@smvitiello <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

Can't wait to ice skate to class.
@marilynmanson is the best fucking band on this entire fucking planet.
@tvluvsong IM ACTUALLY SHAKING
THIS ISNT REAL
I DID AN IMPROMPTU GUEST VOCAL  FOR MARILYN MANSON. HE WAS BEHIND ME. I FRONTED HIS BAND IN FRONT OF 2,500 PEOPLE. FUCK YOUR NIGHT.
@tvluvsong I don't think anyone!
@tvluvsong me and Sarah will be there. Watch me snap me next in half <VICTORY HAND>️
@tvluvsong I die tonight.
I'm seeing my favorite band in the world tonight. My neck is going to fall off. @starlandNJ @marilynmanson I'm coming for you.

@CFeenz hahaha I miss you man.
@CFeenz I'm just ripping on the fact that people treat that as the only song that exists by them haha
And I hope everyone knows I'm completely fucking kidding but really they have more than one song.
I had no idea Merauder released Master Killer as a single and never put out a record or anything. Hardcore always teaches you new things!
@charlie_kupilik Mechanical Animals and Holywood!
Feeling unloved is the SICKEST.
I got a Marilyn Manson hockey jersey.
@charlie_kupilik @StarneyBinson ITS ON ITS WAY. I LOVE YOU GUYS<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>

If this went up in two weeks I would have done it in a matter of seconds. 
@BillyRyan03 @StarneyBinson All solid!
AFI has honestly never released a bad record.
@travis_xvx @unclegarysgirl it's in Jacksonville!
@travis_xvx @unclegarysgirl tickets are only $50 for the day AND it's 13 hours away which isn't bad at all. Lineup is TOO good.

I just told joe to eat my sack.
Burned a copy of Nonstop Feeling for my car. @TURNSTILEHC will have me groovin all over the roads. Hell yeah.
Seriously someone sell me this in XL or 2XL. It doesn't matter at this point and ebay sucks. 
The Internet has decided that All Time Low, Pierce The Veil and Sleeping With Sirens are "grunge". Kurt is rolling over in his grave.
@DeanCribbin 
Forever haunted, more than afraid.
@StarneyBinson Just you wait PINHEAD.
@StarneyBinson lets just say you're gonna get robbed....
Yo life is playing a cruel joke on me right now. This is sick.

@StarneyBinson @smvitiello I found it at this record store near my house five years ago! Hold on let me try and find one for you guys.
Hahaha I'm so fucking annoying.
@smvitiello @StarneyBinson BAE is safe over here. 
I'm literally going to zipper my mouth shut for the rest of my life and just go fuck myself until I die.
I hope something huge hits me in the face and knocks me out for at least 8 months.
@smvitiello same pt. II
@XmawtinX JC hbu

@StarneyBinson @smvitiello DAMN.
@mattycarlock I hope it was better than you imagined!
@smvitiello @StarneyBinson I just ordered it off of Amoeba Records. 13 and some change shipped.
@smvitiello Okay I know what this is about. It's lame.
@smvitiello Woah that's bold. What did they do?!
@jimhammcbride What a loser.
@jimhammcbride woaaaaah hey now
@jvlirose Dang man I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll be better soon and in a smoothie wonderland!
@jvlirose #killinit
@ryanngriffith so stoked man.
I got an 86' pressing of The Queen Is Dead today for extremely cheap and I'm extremely happy.
@StarneyBinson @smvitiello POWER COUPLE. DEFEATED.

@mattwhipple_ DANG
<SKULL><PISTOL> 
I just took a five hour nap. God dammit.
Fuck today was so sick. @codeorangekids is always so fucking cool. Thinner till the grave.
@smvitiello @charlie_kupilik I just woke up from the sickest nap and 100% agree with all the above
“@AltPress: “There will be an Aiden record and most likely a tour”—William Control talks plans for 2015

@codeorangekids was absolute hell in the best way. Best live band without a doubt. #thinners
@BOMBXTARRETO @Rebuildd 
@BOMBXTARRETO TWITCHING. TONGUES.
@unclegarysgirl @travis_xxx  YO oh fuck and NFG is playing sticks and stones.
I hope everybody in my car still likes the used cause that's all you're hearing for 35 minutes :)
@unclegarysgirl @travis_xxx I've never gone on a road trip before! Sounds fun as fuck.
@OnYourMarksBand I think I can fulfill both'
@unclegarysgirl @travis_xxx dude that lineup is unreal. And it's a weekend so fuck school.
@travis_xxx @unclegarysgirl what's the date!
@unclegarysgirl @travis_xxx Yo this lineup is insane. Fuck.
@OnYourMarksBand I think me and Charlie may come tonight. We have to see how our bodies feel after code orange haha
@OnYourMarksBand Y O
@NicoZeppilli <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@NicoZeppilli Give me a hug dammit. And let's talk about how sick the first two my chem records are<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Then I started to destroy myself. With things that I love now the things that I hate. Until it finally broke me.
I'm a living graveyard.
@elenadestories but I'm serious
@elenadestories Yeah myself.
Hahaha but seriously play me in trivia crack. Billdogclinton
Play me in trivia crack. @BilldogClinton.

@mike_barreto don't you dare my friend.
@ryanngriffith YOURE HANGING ON BY A THREAD.
@fuckyouquinten just read about it. good lord.
@fuckyouquinten thought they sucked anyway but I didn't know that.
You like D&amp;D, Audrey Hepburn, Fangoria, Harry Houdini, and croquet. You can’t swim, you can’t dance, and you don’t know karate.
@AdamForrest610 It's too good.
@tina_galdi fuck that
I'm looking at you. @elenadestories
What the hell is a "Lana del bae".
@charlie_kupilik let's hang and you can listen to me yell AFI in my car.
Black Sails In The Sunset is 100% one of the best hardcore records of all time.
What the fuck is wrong with where I live. 
@_Icelink Oh fuck that.
@jackxzabinski Hell yeah dude! Such a good record.
@jackxzabinski Yeah that's the highest I've seen it go for. And motherfuck that.
@jackxzabinski I honestly just may do it only because and original goes for close to $400 and fuck that.
@jackxzabinski I almost did that the other day.
@_Icelink I haven't slept yet so I feel your misery. PS. I miss you.
@breslynn Finally. They're in the third drawer. Thank ya. 1
I'll trade someone a smashing pumpkins shirt to hit me over the head until I fall asleep.
@nikii_nj 100%.
@nikii_nj The best damn band.
You'll never sleep again.
Kill me.
@taylorxyoung @twtchngtongues Hell yeah.
Lyrics of the year go to @codeorangekids without a doubt.
@alexhalper Jesus
@mattycarlock man now I want one of those cookies.
I don't mind the sun sometimes, the images it shows. I can taste you on my lips and smell you in my clothes.
The early 90's Satantic Panic is so embarrassing.
@KillPatricG @BOMBXTARRETO @Katie_Barreto @megbcorio queen bae
@Katie_Barreto @BOMBXTARRETO @megbcorio @KillPatricG Shut up Katie before I send you to that island of only paramore records.
@BOMBXTARRETO @Katie_Barreto @megbcorio @KillPatricG Shots fired.
The Cure is the best god damn band and Wish is the best god damn album.
@Katie_Barreto @BOMBXTARRETO @megbcorio @KillPatricG hey I want in
@charlie_kupilik yes!
@charlie_kupilik get me out of this house.
I've watched 4 full documentaries on the West Memphis 3 and I'm still not satisfied. So fucked up.
However. Not sleeping and feeling awful is not sick.
Tonight was sick. 
Christmas was great. Right now is complete garbage.
<DISAPPOINTED FACE><PISTOL>
@unclegarysgirl Jesus.
@unclegarysgirl sorry<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@gabbysully @elenadestories @KillPatricG @Katie_Barreto GET OUTTA HERE.
“@elenadestories: @__godless FUCK U BRAD” can @KillPatricG and @Katie_Barreto back me up on this one?
@elenadestories should have a volume knob on her vocal cords so maybe we could HEAR SOMETHING YOU SAY.
The amount of love I have for My Chemical Romance is disgusting and extremely sad.
3-2-1
<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION> 
@courtneykracht I might be!
My plan is to listen to Pantera until I feel better.
Deep down, STRONGER THAN ALL.
Code Orange and Body Count took hardcore to a new place this year. And this new place is SICK.
@BOMBXTARRETO for your tears 


Tonight was really weird and cool and I'm glad it happened.
“@elenadestories: 
Mental illness sucks and if your friend has one don't bail on them because it's getting too rough. Imagine life in their shoes. It's hard.
@xtaylormadisonx Hey the news is good enough for me.
@RandomHolidayVA WOAHHHH what.
@KillPatricG @BOMBXTARRETO I second this
@KillPatricG YES. It's one of my favorites.
@KillPatricG I would be honored.
@KillPatricG yes! For a little at least.
Mother of Mercy is playing tonight and it's about to get real fun.
@EarthToNicolee @JManBDTH @IRockThe732 fuck was it really?
@xtaylormadisonx Christmas did come early this year. Dang!
@mickeyxxx is suicide an option?
Yosemite is the worst update in the entire world.

Love is suicide.
Throw me away. Throw me away for good.
This can't be happening right now.
Anyone know of a good record player that has a counterweight and anti skating handle/knob on it? My player really sucks.
@TropDontTweet Best band.
Or Harms Way anything in an XL.
@_f anyone has the Harms Way Pentagram longsleeve and doesn't want it and it's an XL. Keep me in mind.
@Katie_Barreto no
New @XibalbaCA is fucking beautiful.
I wonder what it's like to go to bed completely happy?
Also fuck this sleep pattern.
My stomach is always doing front flips.
We're listening to They're Only Chasing Safety and I miss @k8amodei
@Meg_Mahon SAME<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@Meg_Mahon Haha oh shit when you'd all drive me! Jesus. It's so wild that it was so long ago.
@Meg_Mahon I knew you or Sean would appreciate that.
@ericxmorrison I'm currently listening to it and it's so sick. Real mad I slept on this.
@ericxmorrison I need to check that out. I loved a floral note.
All because of you, I haven't slept in so long. When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean.
There isn't really anything now is there.
It's almost near impossible to top the first four Danzig records.
@xDeathblow It's just insane
World War Live is one of the best things to be released this year. The Master Killer cover just completes it. Twitching Tongues killed it.
@mouthforwar_ alright
@mouthforwar_ I'm so proud of you that's so awesome.
Danzig 4 is all I care about recently.
It's hard. I just can't forget it. Gonna fade 'cause I'm already dead.
Today has been absolute trash.
@bornin2thegrave Speaking of outside a show. I watched Digimon. I fucked up.
Someone get me out of my house before I hit my head against the wall.
I'm just garbage.
Why do I drink coffee when I can just have a panic attack for free?
Low, lower, lowest.
Boy do I love Danzig 4.
Red Bank without @charlie_kupilik sucks.
I'm bummed I lost Greatest Love Song Vol. 666. I need to find another copy. FACK.
BEAT MY HEAD INTO A WALL. PLEASE.
If god is real, he is one sick piece of shit.
@dvvmb They're the absolute best.
@dvvmb don't be! HIM is the best band.
@dvvmb ?!
This life, it ain't worth living. 
My life is bullshit.
I feel like a god damn burden all the time. Literally just a fucking human trash can.
@tylerfromnj @KatieBarretoxD it's incredible.
@FvckWayne @aidannnwhite I LOVE YOU TOO.
@aidannnwhite @FvckWayne looks hot here.
@xdrainmex That had to be a war zone.
It'll never end. It just never, ever ends.
@eatshitxxx @Cal_610 
@gray_beard_ Dang. Incinerate rules too.
@gray_beard_ oh fuck this is awful and they really did. dang this is a horrible song.
@gray_beard_ Let me check it out.
@gray_beard_ they did? What song/that's so fucking dumb
Why do I even bother?
HA HA
I passed experimental psych and I no longer care about anything.
Bury me deep inside your heart.
L o l
Why isn't every pop record as good as Madonna's Erotica?
Yo fuck this
I could not think of a better way to start break than seeing HIM and @abesabadfriend.
THEYRE ENDING WITH WHEN LOVE AND DEATH EMBRACE HOLY FUCK.
I'm in the same room as legends. Fuck.
@yaboysquirrel If they play something off creatures I will 100%
@xdrainmex none dude. It's a HIM show and these kids are absolutely killing it
This MIW pit is hilarious.
HAHA HOLY SHIT 
After 10+ years of waiting I'm finally seeing HIM headline a show tomorrow. Nothing better can happen.
Sorry for that little outburst but dang I love all those bands.
Atreyu, My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, The Used, From First to Last, Underoath, Aiden, Sum 41, Good Charlotte etc. It's all so sick.
I don't care how old or how uncool some music is, 2000-2004 post "hardcore" or whatever lame people call it is so so sick.
And GOD DAMN. A Box Full of Sharp Objects is so fucking good. It's too good for it's own good.
Their first three records are complete works of art.
The Used are still the raddest band.
@bornin2thegrave 100%
My life is just a joke 95% of the time.
Satisfied in your eyes. I'm the biggest fan I've got right now.
You fucking liar. You're gonna burn in hell.
@codeorangekids is playing 20 minutes from my house and I'm so fucking happy it's disgusting.
I never can do anything right. Ever.
My phone is at 1%. I'm not on the train. They played Silverfuck and Drown. I miss/love Sarah and I have a final at 11. Tonight was sick.
If they play silverfuck I'll see you all on the other side.
Also, see @charlie_kupilik in two hours. Merry Christmas man.
See you soon, New York. 
My head hurts
I'm just lost.
<SKULL><PISTOL> 
Everything goes wrong.
Hate
Goodnight
@MarkEglinton It's on my list over break actually! College has been keeping me busy. Very much look forward to it!
@MarkEglinton Yeah! It's actually kind of cool!
My rock and roll professor was in a church choir and grew up with Rex Brown. What the fuck.
Also totally forgot to thank @NickyOutraged for this rad shirt. 
Dunkin Donuts is the reason I'm still breathing.
Quick fixes are pointless. Band aids can't help heal a deep wound.
Lie to me and try to say you never will.
@courtpay3 wassssssup!
I'm not sleeping.
I'm just going to listen to music I listened to in middle school all night.
@mouthforwar_ wish I could RT
@FINALLEVEL this is bullshit man. The FBI was too worried about body count. When in reality they should have been fixing these problems.
Humanity sucks. Cops suck. The courts suck. The NYPD sucks and cops all around should be ashamed of their "brothers" actions.
Cops are murderers hidden behind a fucking badge and corrupt enforcements.
@FINALLEVEL WAS RIGHT BACK IN 92'. THIS SHIT IS REAL AND IS STILL REAL IN 2014.
YO FUCK POLICE BRUTALITY.
Distant dreaming, body's breathing. I still feel your teeth on my neck.
@courtneykracht happy birthday friend!
@eatshitxxx @Cal_610 JUDAS WHY. YOU SNITCHING SON OF A BITCH.
I constantly feel like I'm drowning.
Just watch. History may repeat itself much sooner than anyone could imagine. Police Brutality is real.

Leaving Sarah sucks so hard.
@dylanjamesc666 @mouthforwar_ Dude. Yes.
NEGATIVE CREEP
New title fight is interesting. Reminds me of Lush. Should be a cool record.
@charlie_kupilik down. And I didn't forget!
How and why any band hasn't covered A Box Full of Sharp Objects yet is beyond me.
@surf_goth69 I did. I'm so god damn excited.
I've deactivated facebook multiple times and people can still friend request me, message me and post on my wall. What the fuck.

@maranduhsnyder @TFLN @lizwooods still mind fucked this was actually said in a conversation.
@XmawtinX @BOMBXTARRETO damn that's a lot (I think)
@shotbyemmy It was rad seeing you as always. And thank you. I'm trying!
I hate my life.
@CFeenz jealous honestly.
Whatever.
@twtchngtongues You're the best.
@twtchngtongues are they made just like the others? I'm just curious!
@twtchngtongues got one. You guys rule <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@ashleyjoanmoore IT WAS HALLOWEEN
I'm 100000000% over it.
I just wish I could sing man.
@Nick_Palermo_ it's gonna be a fun time.
Plus I'm excited to talk about how sick sonic youth and the breeders are with @Nick_Palermo_ how sick of a night is that?
Two of my favorite bands are playing tomorrow in red bank. Come have fun. @haveagoodseas0n @Northrunnerband
Bestfriends came to hang man. 
Never trust anyone.
I have a pit in my stomach. It'll never go away. It never ends.
I'm always lied to. It's such bullshit.
@CFeenz in my dreams. <DISAPPOINTED FACE> but thanks for looking out <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@CFeenz I'm jealous. I didn't see the announcement. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@twtchngtongues Awesome! Any specific time?
Didnt even know @twtchngtongues put up the jerseys. Dammit.
But I'm thankful for Sarah. I miss her.
Also don't drink and drive. Please.
I'm sorry if I'm bumming everyone out. That's all I seem to do these days.
I'm just going to sleep. It's the best thing to do at this point. I've never felt lower in my entire life.
@gabbysully <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@weatheredt0wn I wish man. Thank you though. I love you.
I hope everyone has a good day. I'm very thankful for anyone who's still in my life after everything. I love you all.
I'm already spending thanksgiving alone and somehow today got even worse. Rad.

@OfAllThingsAli I am! You're the best.
Pearl Jam is the raddest band.
Someone bring me or get coffee with me.
This already got old.
Support that band til the grave.
@twtchngtongues is the only band or well only thing that could actually make me excited for Black Friday.
Whelp I'm going to have fun sleeping tonight <SQUARED COOL>
#GOAT 
@_Icelink Neither do you man. I'm home in a couple hours. Let's get food with @charlie_kupilik and just kick it. Love you dude.
I don't want to deal with me either. So sorry to anyone I've burdened.
Sorry I'm an inconvenience.
I hate feeling like I'm the biggest burden in the world.
Fuck this
@gcodetb4l XXL bars right there.
The same people who support this cop are the same ones who are burning crosses. Stop being blind. Hate is real. 
@kgarrison @riotghoulx I have one. Thank you very much. Good comeback. Have anymore for the class?
@JackxGoodman I'm glad man. And of course. Just glad you're safe!
I really hope @JackxGoodman is safe.
@kgarrison @riotghoulx also calling other people "bitches" shows how "stand up" you are. You're an adult. Fucking grow up and act like one.
@kgarrison @riotghoulx Take your ignorant self back to wherever you crawled out of because America has no room for closed minded people
@kgarrison @riotghoulx Everyone has the right to live. But some people shouldn't have social media accounts. You being one of them.
@kgarrison @riotghoulx If you have a daughter. I hope you teach her something useful like loving someone for who they are.
@kgarrison @riotghoulx Damn your parents raised you so well. Attacking kids 1/4 your age. Way to go. A stand up American right here.
This happened with Rodney King and we learned fucking nothing. We live in a society where murderers hide behind a badge. Fuck em' all.
Fuck police brutality. Fuck all those jurors and fuck any cop who hides behind their gun. 
Everything sucks man
@XmawtinX down <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><VICTORY HAND>️
@XmawtinX yo same haha
The first two My Chemical Romance records are the definition of flawless. After 10+ years I'm still not sick of/over them.
In my college career I have written 12 papers on Marilyn Manson. But since I didn't feel like trying to write a real paper make that 13.
@EarthToNicolee <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
People are god damn annoying.
@wavesofsorrow whaaaaat haha
@Stephisalive @gabbysully that sounds like an accurate story.
Anything else in my life is completely irrelevant and I just don't care about anything else.
Honestly all I care about is the fact that I'm seeing Marilyn Manson and The Smashing Pumpkins within a month of each other.
2 out of the 4 are done. <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS><VICTORY HAND>️ see you in January @marilynmanson
Goodnight.
I feel like trash.
DO YOU LOVE YOUR GUNS, GOD AND GOVERNMENT?
@briannabittner 
Who's mistake am I anyway?
I hate @methaddicts 
@marilynmanson see you on the 23rd, 24th, 26th and 31st. Also if you play Lunchbox I'm 100% I'll end up in jail. So do it.
Punch me in the face 100 times.
Sex is dead.
Focus on mental health and not gun control. A gun provides the bullet, but the human pulls the trigger.
HOLY SHIT I GOT A TICKET TO THE SMASHING PUMPKINS.
@RealVSteo <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Finally got a @SmashingPumpkin tattoo. I love you. 
It's cool. I'm getting a tattoo for them today so that's what matters right?
@RealVSteo @gabbysully I didn't Fucking get one fuck you both.
Give me a reason to love you.
I make this drive way too much.
Love is suicide
Had no idea the first "moshing" death was at a LOA show back in 95'.
Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine. Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine.
I feel like straight human garbage.
Anti song and anti me I don't deserve a chance to be.
I am drowning.
New medication sucks.
Yo motherfuck this.
Man<DISAPPOINTED FACE><PISTOL>
Sorry for all my Manson tweets but shit. If you're my friend you're not surprised one bit.
@charlie_kupilik ME TOO MAN. ME TOO.
4 DATES IN 7 DAYS. HELL YEAH.
NOTHING CAN RUIN ME AT LEAST UNTIL JANUARY.
YO YOU BET IM CRYING.
@charlie_kupilik PLEASE.
YES. EVERYTHING FUCKING RULES.
MARILYN MANSON IS PLAYING 20 MINUTES FROM MY FUCKING HOUSE.
HOLY FUCK
MARILYN MANSON IS PLAYING STARLAND. SOMEBODY FUCKING CATCH ME.
@BOMBXTARRETO hell yeah!
Well I took a rail to the stomach and pulled something in upper torso. Sick.
They can do nothing wrong. 
Jesus.
Rip out my brains. Pull out my fucking hair. 
@ashleyjoanmoore He's a disaster. But my favorite.
@kelseycohan @bornin2thegrave You just picked me up and then threw me right back under the bus man.
@kelseycohan @bornin2thegrave 
^^^^^
@bornin2thegrave woah hey man I never used that term. I just said it wasn't the best!
@bornin2thegrave is still mad at me haha.
@JEstep14 @SPfreaks @peter_hook1 @MetroChicago Jesus. What I would do to have seen that.
I woke up and then went to bed again because I don't feel like dealing with anything.
Goodnight.
@kelseycohan I'm so jealous.
RIP @deadendpathwb. Thanks for everything.
Calin is playing trap music and Luis is so excited.
@KillPatricG @BOMBXTARRETO I really do<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@BOMBXTARRETO @KillPatricG <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@burriseng Ha ha. Sarcasm isn't needed.
@ZachSclafani I know dude. It's just a little harder for me. Thank you though man.
@ZachSclafani what!
I hate everything about my stupid fucking life.
Reminder for myself to stay off Instagram until tomorrow so I'm not reminded about how I'm not seeing DEP tonight.
A NEW LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE.
Everything in this world is mushroom blue. The deepest shade of mushroom blue.
@mattycarlock HAHAHA that sounds awesome. I miss you.
Portishead is so good.
@surf_goth69 I'm sorry man. That sounds rough.
@mike_barreto hey<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Anxiety isn't "quirky" and not being able to sleep because of it isn't insomnia. It's just pure torture. There's a huge difference.
It was mine at one time. And I have hope that one day it'll be mine again. And the day may be soon.
@SophSwanny Good seeing you as always <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
She puts the seeds in me. Plant this dying tree. She's a burning string and I'm just the ashes.
I wish that I was good enough. Then I'd know that I am not alone.
@CFeenz I miss you too!
I don't know what's going on with GB but I'm going to listen to Marilyn Manson and be offended because the internet told me to be.
@briannabittner Done with you hahaha.
I'm not seeing Sarah for two weeks and that fucking sucks.
@_Icelink I love you too<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Nobody
Loves
Me
@shotbyemmy They are both terrible. Out "paining" someone is just fucking dumb.
@shotbyemmy absolute textbook definition of shit.
The only thing I ever really loved was hate.
@gray_beard_ I miss you man!
I actually almost got kicked out of his Atlantic city show for trying to crawl over people hahaha. Whoops.
If Manson announces a tour I'm going to at least 5 of the dates. And then on the 5th I'll just get ignorant and probably get kicked out.
Thrash/Thrasher/Thrashed.
@j_minervini hey happy birthday man. Hope it's rad!
@dylanjamesc666 <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Marilyn Manson announced a new record and I'm so excited I'm gonna burst.
@mike_barreto couldn't agree more!
@snglmthrsgang is the best band.
Sorry for the spam of Manson shirts on Instagram. Had to get them together so I know what ones I'm missing/still need.
@Itsjohnketcham @lyssturnerr this made my day
@xjoepezzx #cashdaddy
@IRockThe732 @Katie_Barreto Nate you made the best choice you could have made.
@cateyxstover this.
I'm playing life of agony right? Some kid just came up and called them "Wigger wannabe hardcore" I've never wanted to sock someone so hard.
Gone away
Everything is so god damn stupid.
nothing heals. nothing grows.
@charlie_kupilik @LoganOlvera HAHA I quit.
@KillPatricG this is something I would tweet and I love you for you.
God is empty, just like me.
I wish that @mouthforwar_ was here.
@alexhalper I love you too friend!
99% of the time they can't control it and they already feel lower than dirt. Just tell them you love them and remind them you're there,
If you have friends that are anxious and depressed, don't get angry with them when they freak out on you.
I'm fucking over it. I have way too much to fucking deal with.
I'm so done always feeling like shit
This is so fucking stupid
@david_updike the god of* (see what I did there haha)
@heartlys__ yes!
@BOMBXTARRETO please
I know you're gone. I hope you've got some friends to come along.
@david_updike I would but I have work at 5:50/:
Im nothing to anyone except my skateboard. What else is new.
REPENT.
This is what you should fear. You are what you should fear.
I've been up less than 20 minutes and I'm already a nervous wreck.
Thanks for never letting me down and shit. 
@fearfullyfierce <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>
My life is like one continuous nightmare.
@fearfullyfierce Woooooow thx
SAVE YOURSELF FROM THIS. SAVE YOURSELF.
This is currently coming in the mail and I'm so excited. 
Autumn leaves, dying leaves.
@briannabittner foods always a good option.
@bornin2thegrave The fucking best.
Maybe they're wrong. Maybe you weren't on my side all along.
Drugs fucking suck. Rest easy<PENSIVE FACE> 
@charlie_kupilik @_Icelink WINTERBREAK BRUH.
@charlie_kupilik @LoganOlvera love you too man!
@LoganOlvera @charlie_kupilik Charlie with fireball is the best Charlie. Besides sober charlie.
Man Danzig is too fucking good.

@BOMBXTARRETO @Katie_Barreto 
@rrjeu I love you
People think I'm either Gay, Dumb or actually a chick. I love Halloween. This rocks.
Hey 
Seriously. I am.
I'm a goth girl for Halloween.
You were from a perfect world. A world that threw me away today.
I was the only kid in this class that didn't have a partner. Am I in high school again? I won't suck your blood or anything. Geez.
The only thing that has never let me down is every Marilyn Manson record from 94'-2000.
I am 100% miserable.
@Cal_610 That is actually currently on.
Will never understand the hate for Coal Chamber.
If Korn plays Faget on this next tour my neck will fall off.
DEEP DOWN, STRONGER THAN ALL.
New @TURNSTILEHC is so fucking sick. Did not expect that break at the end. Too cool.
Im broken.
Oh and when I saw Manson actually play that, it was over.
Coma White is one of the only songs that can emotionally wreck me within the first 45 seconds.
What a sad morning.
@courtpay3 Are you alright?!
I miss the entire Barreto family. God damn.
I fucking quit.
I want to break my cell phone. Break my computer. Drop out and follow Marilyn Manson on tour.
What another sick night of not getting any sleep.
@FvckWayne I love you too. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I can't do a single god damn thing right.
IWIWD
This world rejects me. This world threw me away.
And they're responsible for music having advisory stickers. That's pretty fucking cool.
W.A.S.P. Is the most underrated metal band of all time. Without a doubt. Thrashers through and through.
I am human trash.
Hell yeah.
I'm about to see a laser show to Dark Side of the Moon.
My war. You're one of them.
@xDIAMONDCUTx Feel better!
Sorry for that sappy tweet but whatever man.
Henry Rollins is one of the best people to ever exist on this earth.
@Rebuildd @BOMBXTARRETO soon! I promise<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I miss Tom and Martin and Mark alright.
@gabehernandez_ Pablo Honey<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
MOTHER
I feel like I'm the only one who thinks Wish is the best Cure record.
@jackxzabinski it sounds like a b-side from Superunknown.
@jackxzabinski Yo. New Soundgarden too!

YOURE. ONE. OF. THEM.
@EarthToNicolee <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@KillPatricG I want that hoodie. Damn.
@charliecheesman Agreed!
@charliecheesman I actually like it.
@charliecheesman where?!
#tbt 
@xjoepezzx ilu
Crying/:
“@KatieBarretoxD: crying.:/” 

@BOMBXTARRETO it's back
Fuck this. 100%
I'm literally at the end of my rope. I'm so tired.
It's too early for this.
Two bands who are hardly relevant are fighting a band that actually made an impact on people. Warped tour kids are fucking dumb.
Anyone who thinks differently should unfollow me because there's a huge chance I hate you. Also fuck Breathe Carolina.
That word suck and so does Attila's discography.
Attila is fucking stupid and Senses Fail is fucking great. Is there really a fight over this.
Degrassi just ruined me for the second time in my life.
Before you see the light, you must die.
So where were the spiders?
Second most underrated song/record of all time. 
@_Icelink I'm trying man. Miss you dude.
Everything about today sucks. Fuck this.
I'm so tired. I'm so very tired.
@j_minervini I'm just not meant for this dude.
I'm only taking four classes. I have a single major with no minor and I still feel like it's too much. Talk about feeling worthless.
And their first record is more important than 95% of current music.
Placebo is a very important band.
@david_updike Of course. Text me if you need anything.
Today is just going to be awful.
Paranoia. aionaraP.
Here's to hoping I can actually stay awake tomorrow.
Sleep has become something very distant.
@david_updike You'll get there man!
You're one of them. You're one of them. You're one of them. You're one of them.
My history of Rock and Roll professor spelled Led Zeppelin as "Led Zepplin". Am I the only one who thinks this is funny and really sad?
You can't name a noise rock album better than Dirty.
@SPfreaks because of all the Adore love. Here's one of the shirts I have from that era! 
Everyone in this computer lab is working on things. And I'm sitting here watching Degrassi High waiting for something. I feel ten.
@Billy @SmashingPumpkin honestly did a really good job. The new single rules.
@nickyxoutraged still feel bad. But thank you<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I'm glad Brujeria, Godflesh and Marilyn Manson are a thing. Pure hatred.
I wish my check would fucking go though. @nickyxoutraged I haven't forgot about you dude. I'm sorry.
@ChelseaBeaver_ go to bed.
@ChelseaBeaver_ I hate u
@ChelseaBeaver_ You first<FACE THROWING A KISS>
@ChelseaBeaver_ shut up
@heartlys__ then give me your number MAN
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please, don't go 
@charlie_kupilik No one should touch that band haha. Pure gold.
Well so much for sleeping huh.
I'm literally running myself into the ground.
As soon as I'm done with class I'm getting in my bed and putting on Degrassi and going straight to sleep.
@briannabittner #metal
@khealynsilroy HAHA REALLY?!
80's Degrassi is so fucked up.
@Rebuildd if I had the money. Fuck.
BE STRONG. BE STRONGER.
Everything has gone to literal shit.
This world disgusts me.
I want to disconnect myself. Pull my brain stem out and unplug myself.
I would give anything to see Rollins Band just one time.
@NicoZeppilli doubtful. 
@_freeandrew hi
Actually. All of L7 could kick anyone's ass.
Jennifer Finch could probably kick anyone's ass.
REBEL GRRRL.
Now you've crossed the line. Now you are finally inside my world.
@AgitatorXXX <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@CFeenz @tylerfromnj <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I quit.
Why is Marilyn Manson playing in the background of a football game?
@weatheredt0wn I miss you too very much <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@twtchngtongues @DisgraceHC this flyer is so cool.
@JuelzB4Swine That is a really good question. I know HIM covered it way back in the 90's but that's all I'm aware of!
@OfAllThingsAli we rule.
I'm pathetic. 
@gabbysully not for $88!
@XmawtinX hey man I miss you too<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@fearfullyfierce <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
@ericxmorrison it's beautiful man. a flawless band.
@ericxmorrison Mellon collie is perfect though. One of the best records of all time.
@ericxmorrison as someone who is currently getting a tattoo in a week for this record. I have to say Siamese dream is my favorite haha.
I can see I'm going blind.
@Rebuildd right there with you. 
@charlie_kupilik figured it'd pass it your way
@allinmerch @Volumesband @charlie_kupilik
@Morganjfaith last night was so sick. Thanks for ripping trough Philly!
@KillPatricG <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@KillPatricG Happy birthday dude!
FAGET.
Y'all can suck my dick and fucking like it.
@startrickpat I am very down man! It was great seeing you too!
@terzuoli316 so are you guys still friends or?
@Rebuildd I miss you too man<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
It was also seeing so many people I love and don't get to see often. That's always a lot of fun.
Everyone needs to see @codeorangekids and @twtchngtongues at least once in their life. Or 100. What a show man.
TONIGHT YOURE COVERED UP IN BLOOD. COVERED UP HEAD TO TOE IN BLOOD.
We found Aiden's "Nightmare Anatomy" in her room at her moms and this is going to be the best car ride.
@courtpay3 missin you too man<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@courtpay3 your last three tweets speak to me on the highest of levels.
@BOMBXTARRETO I miss you both more than most things. Oh and that thing @Katie_Barreto too.
Hey @BOMBXTARRETO remember when milo tried to eat the concrete in your room?
All the kids that ripped on me for having a man bun are now trying to grow their hair out hahahaha. I hope you all start balding.
@yosupaaronheard @helloiamamerica @gray_beard_ 
@travis_xxx I'm glad you're alright dude.
Green Day, NIN and The Smiths will get in without a doubt.
@sammygirll_ 
@jackxzabinski <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
NIN has been nominated to be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. Hell yeah.
Oh fuck. I just got the Christmas card. God dammit. Every year. I swear. Every year they take the worst photo of me.
@caulicakes You having been so on point lately. A+
@Cal_610 did you get a new number? I just tried texting you and it did some weird thing.
@ZachSclafani The amount of things I would do to see L7 is sad and really irresponsible. Legends.
Warped tour should do a ten year anniversary of their 05' line up. Just add on Good Charlotte and you will see middle school tears.
I know you're gone. I hope you got some friends to come along.
Old Motionless In White is still sick and I wish they didn't become pieces of shit. Or fully rip off Marilyn Manson. Creature though, 10/10.
I would do some dumb things to see Aiden without a barrier.
@Riyylen YES. SO UNDERRATED IT PAINS ME.
I wish I could get a dinosaur jr. shirt without paying an arm and leg for it.
#Kutztown 
I don't deserve this.
Bums me out that no one really knows how important Shannon Hoon was. Hope his tortured soul is at ease now.
@OfAllThingsAli happy birthday, Ali!
Welcome to hell.
This is so fucking stupid. I'm done.
My mind is an ocean, I sink like a stone.

ti…
Im so fucking bored god damn.
Are there any other bands to skate to besides Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr? No? Yeah I didn't think so either.
@sarahsrsly <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
Well that's sick I guess.
@scum_will_rise I'll just pretend Divine Intervention is there.
God is gay.
@Katie_Barreto @megbcorio second that ^
The best intro of all time off one of the best hardcore records of all time. The definition of empowerment. 
Avoiding triggers is hard. Facing them is even harder. Lose lose?
My leg is sore man.
@Katie_Barreto are you "..crying/:"
@Katie_Barreto it had to come back. Blame @BOMBXTARRETO
BITE IT YOU SCUM.
I know that this paper won't take long. But I just don't want to do it.
@ChelseaBeaver_ LOL
@_Icelink sup
Also HAHA 
Hey @scum_will_rise don't know if you're into longsleeves but I came across this and figured you'd want to know! 
HAHA I wish I could have just seen Sarah's facial reaction <SMILING FACE WITH HORNS><VICTORY HAND>️
The soundtrack to my life. 
Get me a bucket
@KillPatricG im so down.
@KillPatricG I miss you. God damn.
@charlie_kupilik @xDIAMONDCUTx @brendangroan @IncendiaryHC I did! So rad.
@CFeenz I miss you too<DISAPPOINTED FACE><CRYING FACE>
I'm pathetic. 
The way the rain comes down hard, that's the way I feel inside.
Someday I wont have a brain. They'll take away the part that hurts and let the rest remain.
@xDeathblow Davey is an idol.
God called in sick today.
I feel so terrible.
I can't keep doing this.
Sell me all your AFI shit from any era because all of mine from when I was younger doesn't fit me and I'm bummed. I don't care what era.
I just want one night. one. night.
If there's one band I hope falls off this planet. I hope it's either the script or 5 seconds of summer.
The @deadendpathwb news is such a bummer. But thanks for all the awesome jams. On repeat forever.
Never have I felt so dead.
Encased by my worst fear. I've never felt the nausea of longing to feel nothing, I never wanted to cease to exist, just disappear.
@kelseycohan I've almost been hit by the shuttle here. All I could say was "so close".
@alexhalper For sure<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@alexhalper I miss you!
@sarahsrsly <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Another "I love Sarah why is she with me" tweet.
What don't I mess up man.
My closet is pathetic. And that's not even all of them. 
@Alex_sawyerr I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend.
I think I'm paranoid.
@sammygirll_ <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
I'm so excited for that Madball tour. I'm also excited to see how many kids leave after Turnstile hahah.
@AaronFacher Still proud of you dude!
@JackxGoodman You're at the top my friend.
@NickAbela30 NIN is on that long list of bands that should never be covered.
@NickAbela30 Fuck everything about that NIN cover.
ALSO JUST THROWING THIS OUT THERE 
@alexhalper @charlie_kupilik he better not back out of his other band.
In light of this whole stage diving issue. I'll leave with this. Black flag is fucking sick. 
@alexhalper @charlie_kupilik What?
<PISTOL> 
@yosupaaronheard I can't believe I used to say Disengage was better.
@yosupaaronheard NOW THANKS TO YOU.
I'm not gonna crack.
@NorthRunnerNY okay<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@NorthRunnerNY how soon tho.
I miss/wanna see @NorthRunnerNY so bad.
If my band ever gets off the ground. Everyone should just stage dive off of an amp and just destroy me.
@scum_will_rise @terzuoli316 ^^^
Straight edge, American, and proud of it. Sorry about it @JoyceManor.
@heartlys__ perfect. Let's do it next time I'm home or some weekend!
@heartlys__ yo it just a didn't stay cause instead of bleach we used a hi-lift! If you can get purvana, im in.
@marek_kaczynski Nah it Pitt!
@heartlys__ probably.
@IRockThe732 #edgewatch
@heartlys__ (re dye my hair)
@heartlys__ oh fucking Christ.
@ryanngriffith Corey Taylor came up to you?!
@xjoepezzx @courtpay3 hopefully we make it out there in December.
@travis_xxx yeah!
Of course to celebrate the monster that is I Am King.
Next week I get to see one of my favorite bands absolutely destroy everything in their path. @twtchngtongues is going to be insane.
@terzuoli316 Right there with you man.
@terzuoli316 I'm glad I'm not the only one who has a huge love for AFI.
Nothing from nowhere, I'm no one at all.
@ColinYovng One of my favorite AFI releases. Such a killer 7".
Show me how the gods kill.
#thetearsareflowing 
@tsmith_wav #americanbadass
The Sing the Sorrow B-sides are some of the best material AFI has ever put out.
Stage diving is fun.
Being worried and bummed is the worst feeling.
Today is really lame
@Katie_Barreto I miss it so much
@Katie_Barreto <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@BOMBXTARRETO Stop man I would do anything for that.
@xjoepezzx please. yes.
I'm just going to bed.
All of this hatred is fucking real.
Whatever
Now that the damage is done, I never miss it at all. 
@tylerfromnj miss you too dude! And for sure(:
@tylerfromnj my man.
I'm so excited to see Andrew.
@_freeandrew <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Someone is suing my man boy @rodstewart for some bullshit. You can sue the best in the game.
This is the biggest long shot in the world. But does anyone have this in 2XL? They run small and I outgrew mine<PENSIVE FACE> 
@itzthelimit I honestly love every record. I really loved Crash Love too. That record is beautiful.
And every fall, All Hallows' is so sick and after October no one cares. Dang hardcore is SICK. Actual losers.
@surf_goth69 1000000%
Everything they have released is gold. And if you're too "hardcore" to appreciate their sound change. Then you're a fucking loser.
Half the kids who ripped on me for liking AFI in highschool now love them because they "were" a hardcore band. Fuck off.
@jimhammcbride my pleasure.
@DeanCribbin @lilmattyc thank you dudes!
@DeanCribbin @lilmattyc yo question do you guys have a big cartel? My shirt is way too small on me<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@lilmattyc <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I'm having the worst fucking week and I just want to see my friends man.
@DeanCribbin next time I'm home I want a nacho date.
@DeanCribbin God dammit I miss you.
@lilmattyc Today couldn't get better if it tried. PS. I miss you.
Sick so my transmission is shot. Shout out to me driving fucking everywhere.
I swear nothing ever works out for me.
I'd sell my body to science to hear @AFI play Rabbits Are Roadkill On Rt. 37 just once.
Tumblr feminism.
@katiiiiiejo @colleenrichards since I have oboyle, probably at 10:30!
@katiiiiiejo dude when are you, @colleenrichards and I getting coffee. It's overdue.
@tvluvsong <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@tvluvsong it's kinda sick.
Just almost ran over @katiiiiiejo. Friendship right?
Sonic Youth is way too important to be so underrated.
Nothing will ever go right.
Otep is so good.
Six million ways to die, choose one.
@_freeandrew @sarahsrsly Fucking gross dude.
Sarah is the god damn best. Holy hell. 
In 2004 Sum 41 gave us Chuck and let's all be thankful for that.
@BOMBXTARRETO I MISS YOU TOO
@BOMBXTARRETO 
@BOMBXTARRETO love you too<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@OGbootyfruit <PENSIVE FACE>
@emmilyannb I feel your pain haha
The highlight of my day is getting coffee and that's kind of sad.
@skiptheforeplay I'm sorry friend!<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@skiptheforeplay oh yeah that's right<DISAPPOINTED FACE>
@skiptheforeplay you can make that drive. I'm driving to pit the same day haha.
@shotbyemmy @tylerfromnj <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><VICTORY HAND>️
@tylerfromnj YO I KNOW OK
I slept on knuckle puck and I'm an asshole for it.
This week is going to fucking suck
The best is when your car breaks down.
@terzuoli316 of course dude!
@JeremyXBolm favorites of mind as well. The Reflecting God is one of mind though with those!
@JeremyXBolm Alright I've asked you favorite Manson record before. But favorite song (if that's even possible).
Also, Senses Fail just played the best set they possibly could. Best band.




@SamWeingarten dawg I get to see you tonight
@terzuoli316 Both of those things are so sick.
@ChelseaBeaver_ kms
@ChelseaBeaver_ dead
@terzuoli316 YO
@AnthonyGreen They're the worst man. The worst year of my life.
Or faint. Either or.
I'm going to throw up
Kill me. 
@jackxzabinski seriously it's not at all.
I hate myself for liking this. 
@sarahsrsly Ahhh I love you too<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Don't you know the shape I'm in? You're walking through my heart once more. Don't forget to close the door.
The usual "I love Sarah why is she with me" tweet.
Drunk butterfly
I hate literally everything.
@sarahsrsly @robojimham @_freeandrew the fuck?
Black Metal is sick. I just have no idea where to start. Mayhem is sick. But other than that I have no idea where to start.
My heart is dead and so are you.
Always a burden.
@BoxerNJ_Tyler dude right? I'm down.
@TheCourtTavern fuck yeah. That made my day.
Remember mail? You know mail orders and letters? That should be a thing again.
@BoxerNJ_Tyler You should know I'm 100% for all of that and then some
No wonder I don't trust anyone. The amount of shit you can hide on these things is outstanding.
@caulicakes It's sad and it's pathetic.
I wish flyers for shows were in record shops. So I could get rid of all of this and maybe not be so paranoid for five minutes.
@caulicakes Honestly if I could find out about shows without them, they'd all be gone.
Your hardcore cred won't pay your fucking bills.
This is all bullshit. None of this is real. Get outside and go fucking do something with your life.
Instagram was cool until it just became a bunch of losers trying to out do everyone.
If I could learn about shows without social media I wouldn't have any of these stupid fucking things.
Snapchat is shit. Tumblr is shit. Facebook is shit. Cell phones are shit. Twitter is shit.
Fuck you
Welp I'm not making it to my next class.
@khealynsilroy <PENSIVE FACE><PISTOL>
Because then I don't have to hear about how much you spent on a shirt and I can watch moms lose their shit.
Hardcore is cool and all but can Madonna make another record and tour instead?
Don't belong. Don't exist. Don't give a shit.
@NickAbela30 that was supposed to go to you LOL
@__godless could you imagine 2004 Atreyu without a barrier? Fuck.
@ryanngriffith <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@robojimham HAHA
You know what band I want to see without a barricade? Atreyu.
@jenalive11 Garbage is so underrated it hurts.
@XmawtinX not the reason at all
Seeing photos of people I care about in a different state of mind literally break my heart.
@shoreXcore @XmawtinX LOL
Alcohol is dumb. Drugs are even dumber.
I literally feel empty. Like a hollow shell.
Life is fucking pain.
STRIKE YOU DOWN.
@cass__nz I would die to see them.
I wish I wrote this but hell yeah, Kutztown. 
Hahaha I got so fat hahahahahaha
Wish the darkness didn't cloud me. Wish I wasn't an emotional wreck.
I still can't believe I saw Life of Agony.
Empty through and throughhhhhhhhhhh.  I don't care this is sick. 
@sarahsrsly the river runs red #HEH
HIM IS PLAYING STARLAND. OH HELL YEAH.
@sarahsrsly STOP WHAT
I wish I was able to see Slipknot at any point between 99'-05'.
@VictorxNJ Love you dude.
It was cool for U2 to give away a record. I just think that's cool. It may not be the best but i wish more bands did that on a higher level.
I'm about to get a cheeseburger with glazed donuts as buns. My depression is cured.
@bornin2thegrave Honestly that's not bad. It was good seeing you last night!
@bornin2thegrave oh shit. one from the 80's?
Ya 
@Vicehc I'm so excited.
Esu Wawa is 100% pathetic. Dang.
@BigMoneyHansen to bleach purple out it takes at least two to three bleaches. My blue took two and all the color still wasn't out.
@masquerjade WHAT. NO.
@masquerjade no. how bad.
@angmeoww thank you.
I feel like fucking trash
I'm actually livid. That triggers me so bad and not one person gives a guck really.
Man I love when kids blatantly hit on my girlfriend over the internet.
My school could of had Third Eye Blind play homecoming but we got chance the rapper. Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?
"Him name is YEEZUS and you will say his name correctly" - a kid to my professor.
@weatheredt0wn I love you dude. Text me if you need anything <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
I am so miserable.
@startrickpat Take mine. Anything U2 put out past 94' has been trash.
Why me. Why tonight. Why now.
Tears they flow but why am I crying? After all I am not afraid of dying.
@_Icelink <DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
My heart goes out to anyone who was lost in a real American tragedy 13 years ago today. I hope they are all at peace wherever they may be.
@fearfullyfierce still uses the "x3" hearts and I'm wondering if she's just stuck in third grade or just really likes Simple Plan.
I miss @sarahsrsly and I'm tired and I wish she would just crawl into bed with me right now.
People = Shit.
I haven't slept since I woke up and found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker.
I am trash.
@ChelseaBeaver_ @automatic_wish @wheres_drew95 @BERRYsancream @ozellah17 @Tori13sTeam  I'm lost
@masquerjade HOW

CHECK OUT THE "BIRTHDAY ANTHEM"(VIDEO) &amp; #GoCrazy 

LIKE COMME…
@Cal_610 happy birthday dude!
Speaking of records that are so underrated it hurts. Hole - Live Through This.
@travis_xxx you're the best. I'll DM you my number tomorrow. I have to sleep for some lame class tomorrow. Thank you so much though!
@travis_xxx I actually may dude! That'd be awesome.
@travis_xxx 100%!
See you in Pittsburgh, @codeorangekids <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Cal_610 Me either! They fit perfect for me. I honestly will get a shirt either way but Gildan just fits perfect haha.
Also incase you all were wondering, getting tea tree oil in your eye fucking burns.
I'm the only one who likes Gildan. The XL's fit perfect because I'm so fucking short.
@mattwhipple_ <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I hope they play seasons.
@jackxzabinski Thanks man! I'm so excited.
@jackxzabinski Life of Agony!
I'm seeing my favorite hardcore band this weekend and I can't fucking wait.

@NicoZeppilli JESUS
@NicoZeppilli WHEN
“@PropertyOfZack: Some Teens Have No Idea What “Smells Like Teen Spirit” Is About 
I hate abbreviation.
Slipknot has saved my ass this week man.
Nothing ever goes my way.
Neither of those pieces of shit should be walking.
I am no one.
@ChelseaBeaver_ Then these last two years will be fucking gorgeous.
I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems.
Jesus Christ.
My mind hates everything that I love or anything that is relevant to my life. Punch me in the face please.
6 (sic) 6
@SophSwanny this doesn't surprise me one bit.
“@tinderfessions: Met my tinder match. He has a fart fetish and made me fart in his mouth. It was kind of hot - Meg” @sarahsrsly

Walls, let me fall. Fuck you all.
W h o c a r e s?
I wish prohibition was still a thing.
Open
Joan Rivers is dead and today officially fucking sucks.
@NickAbela30 @sarahsrsly not in my condition.
How @sarahsrsly is still with me is such a mystery.
No one gets it. At all.
After that your announcement I can assure everyone that @xjoepezzx is hysterically sobbing wherever he is.
Name your God and bleed the freak.
@terzuoli316 Jesus
@terzuoli316 Yo wait what. That exists?
F u c k t h i s.
I've been up three whole minutes and I already want to go back to bed.
My brother is a senior. What the fuck.
Someone punch me in the face please.
Tomorrow is going to be so rough and I'm not looking forward to it at all.
@b3cc3rs that statement pains me all the way from PA.
@BOMBXTARRETO I wish that was my night because mine is terrible.
I can't do today
I'm positive Around The Fur is one of the best metal records of all time.
Disconnect myself.
@sarahsrsly Well not exactly. But don't do that and you're welcome.
Oh shit. Faith No More announced a new record. Fuck yeah.
I just want to sleep the day away. Today is not my day. Just like yesterday, and the day before.
@cateyxstover told you!<WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@cateyxstover this made my day
@travis_xxx You and me both
@travis_xxx the worst
@Tori13sTeam Rough
I feel like trash.
Today is gonna be s i c k
@sammygirll_ nah
I can't feel it anymore.
@marek_kaczynski Just break them all. I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to. They think they're so sick in their sperry's too.
@marek_kaczynski It's fucking awful right?
My entire school 
“@WorldStarFunny: teacher: sit down
me: drank” @_freeandrew
@courtpay3 love you too dude. Let's do it.
@KyliSimonelli Jesus
I've been so stressed that I'm starting to disassociate. Fantastic.
Depression is not and never will be a joking matter.
hi @sarahsrsly my phone died and I'm waiting for it to turn on!
I AM KING. 
@marilynmanson OH MY GOD
Being anxious is cool.
@angmeoww Dude. C'monnnnnn.
@guacaflocka this is the best thing I'll see all day.
Go buy the new Code Orange record and have your face melt off.
No amount of incubus could make me enjoy being in this class right now.
@_freeandrew <PENSIVE FACE><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Bleed me out.
“@sarahsrsly: “@__godless: “@sarahsrsly: “@__godless: This where I break up with Sarah.” I will stab u” suck my ass.” gladly <PILE OF POO>”  shut up.
“@sarahsrsly: “@__godless: This where I break up with Sarah.” I will stab u” suck my ass.
Yep it's over.
This where I break up with Sarah.
@BOMBXTARRETO @Katie_Barreto Holy shit.
@CFeenz @weatheredt0wn I'll cry to hundredth with you anyday of the week.
THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF POUNDED OH MY GOD.
@_freeandrew it's 2am?
Literally I'm hearing shower sex to the extreme right now and I can't stop laughing cause I'm so uncomfortable HAHAHAHAHA.
My favorite thing I think is just being seen as "the boyfriend".
@BOMBXTARRETO @EarthToNicolee @Katie_Barreto Tom U started dis 1
@BOMBXTARRETO @EarthToNicolee I'm with tommy boy (z 2 men)
@EarthToNicolee @BOMBXTARRETO Pepperjack is a+
Sarah and I found old issues of Rolling Stone and found the Kurt Cobain issue right after his suicide. Shit.
The Breeders are recording a new record and I'm doing everything I can not to scream.
@BandofNOTHING is playing with Body Count and that's the sickest fucking thing.
@courtpay3 if you're there the weekend of the 13th I'll be there.
What*
That is exactly why you do. 
Today is just not my day
CARVE THE WORDS INTO YOUR (notebook) 
Some people would die for what you have. Me included. Stop being such a fucking dork.
Fucking idiot.
I don't give a fuck how sad you are that you couldn't get fucked up last night. You have a rational and functioning mind. Appreciate that.
@ryanngriffith 
Missin the main homie, @courtpay3.
@colleenrichards I could not back this harder.
Panic attacks in class are lame. Slipknot, however, is not lame.
I really love The Used.
My nails are black again.
@shutupesther yes
I'm essentially a piece of shit.
Hahaha I suck whatever HAHAHAHA
Wow I am so fucking bummed haha fuck me right?
HAHAHAHAHA
@fearfullyfierce give me my hair tie back god dammit.
@terzuoli316 Dude I would be groovin all over if I could be there.
I now own a safari hat and I'm never taking it off.
Hallowed Be Thy Name is easily in the top ten of all time.
@tsmith_wav <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><PISTOL>
@deathwishinc followed me. That's so fucking cool.
Acid Bath is just too sick.
I'm pretty much dead inside.
@sarahsrsly terrible band, awful song.
@katiiiiiejo YO. WHEN.
This will be the longest 2 hours of my life.
I'm a human wreck.
I can't stop listening to the new Code Orange.
@Tylerthegirl hey it's the only way some of us can keep the hair from falling in our faces 24/7
@Tylerthegirl <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
@Tylerthegirl don't hate on the man bun
Rest easy, Raw Biz.
Say no to class and yes to coffee.
There's goes any chance of sleeping <VICTORY HAND>️
Just got asked to name my 5 favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers songs. Do I look like a poser? Or maybe he was being serious. Dang.
Go listen to the new @codeorangekids. Right now.

@NickAbela30 it's not even at my school
At least the new code orange record is fucking mental. A+
Get the fuck over yourself
Half the kids I have to be around are the biggest pieces of shit.
Why does every kid who goes to Kutztown like Ice Nine Kills?
@weatheredt0wn wish u were here 
I'm the asshole that says the best AFI record is Sing the Sorrow and I'm happy I'm that guy.
I fell into yesterday.
Slipknot and Korn on the same tour? I'm ready to party like it's 1999.
@TropDontTweet HAHA such a classic.
I give up.
Haha fuck you guys I'm stoked Lorde won HAHAHAHA.
@Morganjfaith me and you both dude.
I'm honestly just a huge piece of shit.
This is not who I am.
@sarahsrsly YO I DO
@Alfofmelmac4 I'm so stoked
@sarahsrsly oh dude you're so late. 

<WHITE SMILING FACE>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
Kings of war (on my wall) @twtchngtongues @codeorangekids 
@BandofNOTHING @FINALLEVEL The hardest band on the planet.
It's just getting too overwhelming.
I literally live in a constant state of fear and paranoia.
I just want to sink in my bed and not come out for 6 weeks.
“@NicoZeppilli: I could write a book on how to make a girl cry lol” me and you both.
@ryanngriffith I work at my school and today was move in day<PENSIVE FACE>
@_freeandrew DEP is just one of my favorite bands and I'm so upset
Go watch @deadendpathwb and see one of the best I'm hardcore fucking murder back to school right now.
I'm missing one of my favorite bands in the world right now and I have never been so bummed.
100% over it
I'm jealous of anyone who lives in AUS. The fact that you can see sundial has me so jealous it's disgusting.
@xjoepezzx PLZ<PENSIVE FACE> I'll pay you back.
Seriously someone pick me up a dead end path shirt pleaseeee
Bleed me out.
You don't care. You're always sick.
Bleed me out. Hang me upside down. I wanna feel what it's like to leave you.
So I prepared for the worst and I ran for my life.
I can't make it tomorrow. Someone pick me up a dead end path shirt because I love that band and I'm bummed I'm 2 hours away. Support them<SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES><VICTORY HAND>️
<PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> 
@_freeandrew @sarahsrsly rumor has it I'll be at esu this entire three day weekend next week<SMIRKING FACE> maybe you'll get some.
Happy Birthday, Layne. I miss you.
I sleep to escape, because drinking kills you anyway. So why when I wake does my heart still ache?
I have work in 15 minutes. I should probably get out of bed.
@Cal_610 YO
@KevinSardy they're nothing alike but I do love nirvana.
They write lyrics with true pain and extreme passion and the music behind them is beautiful and haunting. They're  the absolute best.
I'm pretty sure Daylight (Superheaven) will always be one of my favorite bands. That band is miles above any current band.
I hope one day the internet crashes and never recovers.
Jar
Death walks beside us.
This is a cruel joke.
@Bedridden_ <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ glad you like them!
Everyday is exactly the same.
@colleenrichards @raychel_austyn I remember I was working that day and I just asked myself "why".
@XmawtinX I hate you.
@XmawtinX I'm going to LOA so why don't you suck it for me.
@XmawtinX I wish you were my roommate though. Only I know one morning I wouldn't wake up with hair and you would wake up without eyebrows.
@XmawtinX I hope they think alternative is all time low and you get fucked with a lame roommate. That would make my year.
This is so. fucking. stupid.
I'm honestly dumb founded.
Fuck everyone.
