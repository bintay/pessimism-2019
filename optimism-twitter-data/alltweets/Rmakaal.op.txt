Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.
Nobody ever drowned in his own sweat.
When the world says, "Give up,"Hope whispers, "Try it one more time."
To the question of your life, you are the only answer. To the problems of your life, you are the only solution
Put your future in good hands - your own.
God is closest to those with broken hearts.
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic.
We all live under the same sky, but we don't all have the same horizon.
Physical strength is measured by what we can carry, spiritual by what we can bear.
If you can wear the hard times of your life as furrows on your brow, you can wear the good times as a twinkle in your eye.
To everyone is given the key to heaven, the same key opens the gates of hell.
Every thought is a seed. If you plant crab apples, don't count on harvesting.

When you do good , your part is done.
Nature will pay you back - Expect
nothing from no man.
You can only fall if they put you on
top , but when you WORK hard with
BLOOD &amp; TEARS... No bloodclot person
can stop you
For all of life's simple pleasures, I say,
"Thank You, God!"
Learn to say 'no' to the good so you can
say 'yes' to the best.
Don't compare your Chapter 1 to
someone else's Chapter 20.
If you don't think you have any
blessings remember your heart is still
beating.
There's money to be made. Life to love. No
time to waste doing drugs and partying

Dear crush, Fall in love with me.
My phone battery lasts longer than
most relationships now a days.
Fools always exaggerating, blowing shit out of proportion, makin a big deal out of nothing, all in their feelings. Ain't got time for that
It's funny how some people who don't even
know you, have so much to say about you.
I remember when my old Nokia phone said I
had low battery it meant that I had 2 days to
find a charger.
The moment you start seeing life as a

Sometimes the best way to solve a
problem is to just stop caring.
Cheating is directly linked to lack of
intelligence, insecurity, low self esteem
and an overall sense of unhappiness
with one's own life!
If you are still breathing maybe it is
not such a bad day after all.
Don't let yourself be controlled by
three things: people, money, or past
experiences..
The best way to make ur dreams come through is to wake up. .

You may not understand today or
tomorrow, but eventually God will
reveal why you went through everything
you did. #GodPosts
To everyone going through anything
struggle or pain right now, keep your

Remember the good times, be strong
