@CoryxKenshin - The story is excellent and the character you play as is very much a well written one. I hope you at least check it out!
@CoryxKenshin - however since you are a very non-judgemental person, I feel like you would enjoy it regardless. The game is The Cat Lady -
@CoryxKenshin - you should also play. It's very dark and has themes that you as a Christian might not particularly enjoy being represented -
@CoryxKenshin Hi Cory, I hope you read this. I'm watching your Presentable Liberty video and there is a game that is similar that I think -

and then you get compleeeeeeeetely blanked as if you didn't tweet at all.
and you do actually go 'hey lets rp' and respond to peoples open rps
it's pretty annoying when you're literally online every day. and I mean literally. every. day.
i mean i said i was thinking of leaving and i didn't get a single reason to stay so????
pfft

you know you fail at recovery when you specifically go hunting for that blade you absolutely knew you had somewhere rather than just eh
Ain't that a kick in the head?  "That New Vegas Radiation!" at ♫  
8tracks is my haven though
@savdere @obamasexual well words and actions are two very different things.
I made this but uh yeah. //Check out this mix on @8tracks: "sora, don't ever change." at ♫  
but uh. guess most people don't think like that
not being there at all but coming back once it's all over
and yeah ok it's not nice to have sad friends, but even being there and saying 'hey idk what to do to make u feel better' is better than
not nice to have a sad friend you need to comfort because it's only nice to receive the comfort
and then later when i've dealt with it on my own in whatever way and i'm feeling better they come running back because it's apparently
and just this once it would be GREAT if you could do the same but uh guess not huh
like wow remember that shoulder i gave you? remember when i lifted your mood that time and all those other times?
why is it that people need me to help them or talk or whatever and that's fine but when i try and talk to them they just blow me off

@savdere - to max and all your other followers, it's amusing.
@savdere -they're clearly a bad person, but you don't have beef with them because you're such a saint. aha. no. go on, bitch about me-
@savdere -that was pretty much inactive with a password they knew and fuck around with it, you think you should have beef with them because-
@savdere -no way they want to be around two faced bitches, buuuut, when they do something impulsive and stupid like log into an account-
@savdere ah yes, i see your logic. it's totally okay to treat a person like shit, lie to them, bitch about them when they realise there's-
@charlesfrith @frankieboyle @BBCNews In what way would a 3 year old intimidate you so bad you had to kill her??? Ugh.

@asdfghjkidrxuhl Except being a 'celeb' is always going to mean that whatever you do, people are going to see it. Stop being idiots.
"Justin Bieber's just a teen, don't be so hard on him" He turned himself in on ASSAULT CHARGES. Stop defending him and stop being cunts.
@CryWasTaken jesus fucking potatoes
@wwwbigbaldhead Hmmm. Maggie is based on Anastasia and Anastasia was never a Disney movie.
my username as a seed for minecraft on the 360 is literally an ocean with a few mooshroom biomes. useless
@TeeshaHenry_ The books are better.
@JustAzita Because he's a twat and you Beliebers are so ignorant.
@xxPandaLizziexx Got to take my sister to her nan's on Sunday :|
@xxPandaLizziexx Justin Bieber got arrested because he was DUI and drag racing.
Pretty sure you dumb idiots would say the same if he was DUI and killed someone. "Oh he's going through a bad time."
Your idol gets arrested and you pretend not to care because you'd rather be ignorant than face up to the fact he's actually a bad person.
@JBieberzDork This is what happens when you realise he's a little cunt and has been all along.
Would love to hear how Justin Bieber's fans will attempt to defend him over this. You deluded idiots.
I liked a @YouTube video 
@taobizi @HeyMrsAmerica Wow. Because everyone needed more proof that Beliebers are cunts.
Not quite sure why #Beliebers are so obsessed with their idiotic, immature, rude 'idol'. He's a cunt. You're cunts. End of.

Tom Daley is in a gay relationship with a male but clearly said in his video that he still fancies girls. So he's bi. BI.
@bieberswanted except he's actually bi. they're also not straight girl monopoly.
Cold As You is always great.
You do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted.
"is taylor even country any more though" taylor has and will always be country. doing new things on new albums doesn't change that fact.

@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande "Nobody cares about her other songs except fans" which is what makes you ignorant. have a nice day sweetie :)
she rock to the east she rock to the west but she the girl that i love best
hear that? that's the sound of ignorance.
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande - she's not baring her skin and being a poor role model.
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande - negative stuff in there. 10 songs are about negative feelings and such. so there are your facts. at least-
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande -family, friendship with The Agency bandmembers and other positive stuff. Red definitely had more of the -
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande -around John Mayer(?), which is the largest group of songs written for one individual. the rest are about her
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande -ship with Abigail and with her family. In Speak Now, 8 were about negative relationships but centered -
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande -in Fearless, 3 again were about negative relationships, and the rest positive ones, including her friend-
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande -to think. in her first album, 3 songs were about her own negative relationships, and 4 weren't about her -
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande yes, she sings about love a LOT, but not necessarily about hating guys or other people like you all seem -
remember when twitter lists were like the biggest privelege ever
@waitwhatever @_KidrauhlGrande have you even read the lyrics for most of her songs? if you did, you'd know that's not actually the case.
and here you can hear ten year olds hating on someone much better than themselves :)
@_KidrauhlGrande nope, because she actually writes about stuff that matters, not immature boys :)
@drwsbutera do your research before you hate

@omgloll4 @BenRT Fine. Remember that when people run you off the internet for your ignorant manners. Have a nice day, sweetie. :)
@omgloll4 @BenRT You should grow up and accept not everyone cares about Justin Bieber, and stop attacing others.
@omgloll4 @BenRT give their own opinion, which is totally legal, btw. Hypocrite.
@omgloll4 @BenRT and their actions so blindly, so much that you would insult others for their own opinion when you jump on others when they-
@omgloll4 @BenRT And neither do you? But please, point out where I said I hated you. I said you're mindless for following someone-
Don't just just love how JB fans are into double standards?
@omgloll4 @BenRT - suddenly that's okay for you? Wow. What are you, 14?

It's 5.32am and I need more sleep but going to sleep pissed at people's ignorance is bad.
@Kayla_Weir10 - 'not allowed to be immature' because she's such a 'slut.' Uff.
@Kayla_Weir10 -None of her singles from Red were written during or after their relationship, so... but wait, it's Taylor Swift, she's -
@Kayla_Weir10 -within her own personal rights. It's not like she mentioned him by name. Do you even KNOW she was talking about Harry?
@Kayla_Weir10 Ordinary people every single day take jabs at their exes, and not in always immature ways. What she did was perfectly -
@Kayla_Weir10 What about freedom of speech? I thought that's what America prides itself on.  But not about 'slutty' women, apparently.
@Kayla_Weir10 But when 1D are immature, it's just 'the lads being lads'? That's hardly fair.
@avonstattoo @taylorswift13 Someone's bitter~
*rolls eyes up to the sky* jfc
@ssamantha_anne This. None of her singles from Red are about Harry fucking Styles in any way, people need to do research omg.
@xNarryFeelsx Says a 1D fan. Hypocritical, much? Remember when Directioners sent death threats to her and other girls? Yeah.
Funny how when Kanye dissed Taylor on stage, no one called Kanye out on his 'immaturity', but Taylor does it, everyone hates her?
@lizzardlizzie18 @taylorswift13 Except she does, do maybe do your research?
@Kayla_Weir10 @taylorswift13 She's an adult, she can say what she likes, just like you calling her out on her 'rudeness'.
