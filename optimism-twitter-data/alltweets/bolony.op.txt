@CandaceMoon Thank you CM.
@brattybunny Bikini day for bunny.  Hot steamy day in NYC in suit and tie in a cubicle for Bolony. :(
I'm going to show this woman what great shape i can be in. She will be amazed at what I can do. Her head will turn. Lol.
I imagine she'll still have me do chores during the summer while she's at the beach with her friends. That will be nice for her.
She just wants me to get stuff for her, clean up, do laundry etc. But she does not want to see me. She is off during the summer.
She said I should stop thinking and just do exactly what she says.
I'm not seeing this woman anymore - maybe once a week at most. But i still serve her. I shopped and cleaned for her yesterday.
This morning I worked out a lot while I listened to the grateful dead. I'm getting in great shape - so happy!
@HarleyxQuinnn Wow what a coincidence. I'm concerned I will gain weight if I eat too much pizza. So I tell on myself. Lol.
I had a slice of pizza today for lunch.
Does anyone out there have the Monday blues? I sure do.
Yesterday I folded her laundry, changed her sheets, made her bed, and bought groceries to her. She was out with her bf while I did this.
Happy Mother's Day to all women out there.
She was cool with that. Then she had to go to a photo shoot so i left. I told her everything I needed to. So we'll see. I'm relaxed.
Tea was at her house. She asked if I wanted a beating but I knew she wasn't into it so it said "another time when you're in the mood'
So today I met up with her. We had mex Dinner. Went to get her nails done. I didn't sit with her. Instead i did her laundry. Then we had tea
@CandaceMoon Doing well CM. Thanks for asking. Hope you're well too.
I'm slowly realize  how irrelevant I am in this woman's life. I can get obsessed over her; yet remain a mere afterthought for her.
@CandaceMoon Morning CM.
@gg_lyn Giood morning to you too, Milf Gigi.
We sort of made up. We're on speaking terms at least. I don't think she likes me much but it's hard to tell.
It's getting obvious. She's holding on to me for the money. I hold on to her because I like being a real time slave. Friendship is gone.
When she told me she couldn't make it I said - "ok no problem. I will go kick."  Not the least bit of disappointment.
So after all the back and forth bickering with her today, we decided to meet around 6pm. Then at 5:50 she cancelled. Just as well.
I told her off today. I said its impossible for me to know when to text her and when not to because she always says shut up and don't text.
@MistressTdotnet Well for us that is a sexy pic (you're in it!).  Lol, Mistress T. Haha.
@little_mina69 Oh my god, little Mina! What a picture! Are you now an empress? Or still little? Or both?
I had a very small breakfast. Then I had 2 veggie burgers without the roll. I have no appetite now. Do y'all lose appetite from veg burg 2?
@trishapaytas Glad you're enjoying your life.
@CandaceMoon Thank you, CM.
@CandaceMoon thanks CM - it's hurtful - like losing a girlfriend that you once loved and realizing things will never be the same. A loss.
@lelulovexo Wow what a great view. So much better than my cubicle. Lol.
@CandaceMoon Hey CM. Sadly - things are winding down. Trying to get a soft landing though.
@noelknight I'm working this morning. But it's hard to get motivated. Need my boss to kick my ass.  lol.
I will suggest that maybe we can talk the next time we "run into eachother."  So it will imply no communication or meeting.
...her text messages are arriving on different phones and some are reaching me late or out of sequence. I want her to give up on texting me.
I'm going through some pain and confusion with this woman. I've decided my next text message to her will be telling her that her text....
@greeneyed9 That skirt looks pretty on you.
@JJplush that's odd -- you normally don't see cats at banks.
But I don't blame her for this at all. It's entirely my fault. I did it. Now i feel the pain of withdrawal. I wish her nothing but the best.
The weight is just melting off me with this new workout routine. So glad i found it. But right now I'm ill we with yucky feelings from her.
But I'm optimistic about life after I move on from her. I find myself today in great shape and grateful that my body is doing so well.
I barely reply to her text messages. I hope she gets the message and just forgets she ever knew me.
It's not the money that bothers me. It's that she won't give me any time. I don't even want to log onto FB to see her.
Things are approaching a critical juncture with this woman. Bottom line - i can't afford her anymore. And I feel lousy about her.
Good morning twitter friends. Today I am a little sad yet optimistic for the future. Feeling hopeful I suppose. Getting in great shape too.
@WorshipMackayla I'm also hearing good things about iwantclips. I may switch.
@WorshipMackayla which is your favorite clip site? C4s, iwantclips, or kinkbomb?
@theBlackFuhrer I agree. We should have electricity.
@CandaceMoon Cubicle life for me, CM.
@CandaceMoon Eat and drink CM!
@jasoninja My motto about hair: it always grows back, can't cut it too short. Lol.
@jasoninja Sounds like you're a busy man, Jason.  Don't work too hard. lol.
She doesn't know I'm sad. She just knows I'm less interested, not angry, busy, willing to serve, and accepting that I won't see her.
All the fun things I've done with her over the past 9 months are turning into a ball of sadness now.
But I'm more than willing to serve her remotely. Let's see if she's as sick as I am. Or if she has a conscience. It will be interesting.
I told her I feel she doesn't want to see me anyway. Suggested this way is probably best and asked if she agreed.  I don't want to see her.
.....and said I was working and didn't have availability. But suggested i drop stuff and $ at her house so she won't see me ....
This morning at 6am i get a flurry of text messages from her re shopping, her nails, groceries, laundry. I replied and said....
In reality I'm deeply hurt because she doesn't want to see me. I'm sad but not angry. I don't want to see or talk to her anymore.
She asked if I'm angry with her. She senses something's up. I just replied - no, I don't feel anger towards you.
@PekoLux that's nice. I wish I could go to the beach.
She asked if I was available for shopping today. I told her I was working late. I don't want to see her anymore.
@PekoLux Do you go to the beach a lot, Peko?
@PekoLux I would like to go to Jimmy John's one day, Peko. Now that you said it was good I may go!
@PekoLux Do you enjoy eating at Jimmy John's, Peko?
@AnnieSprinkle Do you miss the days when you performed at Show World Center in NYC, Annie?
She is within her rights to reject me at any time. It it hurts me,  I'm the one responsible. I must remain respectful to her at all times.
The situation with this woman is a little depressing but I have to remember its not her fault. My feelings are my responsibility.
I was starved. I just had turkey Swiss mustard lettuce tomato on whole wheat role. But I'm down to 190. Marching to 180!
I predict she'll feel guilty for not hanging out with me. Hope she does. I still won't see her - my switch has been turned off. Watch!
Next i'll offer to just drop off $ when she's not around. She'll think  I'm like a normal man who wants to see her - but I'm not normal.
...or send me a pic and I'll buy it and drop it off when she's not around. I expresses no desire to see her.  Next I'll offer to....
She asked if I was available to shop and I said no. Said it was easier for her to have me order it online. Or send me a pic and ....
I actually don't even want to see this woman anymore.  I like serving her remotely for now. Today she asked if i was available to shop.
@lelulovexo Wow, great dinner! Happy sinko de mayo to you too Lelu!
@lelulovexo How exciting! A new house! Congratulations, Lelu!
@lelulovexo How beautiful!
She's going to get confused because i can hold out a long time. I'm happy not seeing her. I associate her with bad feelings now.
She doesn't know how twisted I am. I don't care about seeing her anymore. I'm happy just serving remotely.
This woman starts with me by texting. So we chat and then all of a sudden she tells me to stop texting like I'm annoying her but she started
@PrincessSiennaL Darn it! Can i guess again? Or does everyone only get one guess?
@PrincessSiennaL I would like to guess. I say they are painted rainbow style.
@mylindseyleigh You are pretty.
@AaliyahLove69 Great advice. Thank you, Aaliyah.
@CandaceMoon doing well too, CM.
@CandaceMoon morning CM. How are you?
@homeworkslave87 @QueenZanita Thank you. I forgot to mention I've been drinking lots of water all day long.
@SexyAsianaStarr @OriginalRigger No - the thanks goes to you two - for making great clips for us.
She is slowly giving me a shopping list. As she goes about her day, she tells me what she needs as she thinks of it. Maybe she's keeping me?
This woman's mood swings are hard to keep up with. I need advice on how to deal with her.
I guess she's put up with me long enough. But when one door closes, another opens. Good night all.
Good night to all my twitter Friends. This chapter of my life with this woman is winding down. She's been avoiding me and cutting me out.
@AshleyFires @ItsCleoLive @SadieHolmesxxx @KateQFunny Wow Cleo is getting famous. Good to see!
@brattybunny It was the most boring fight I've seen. Would have been much better off watching bunny clips. Next time I'll know.
@chantarose You look great, Chanta!
@OriginalRigger First bowling and now this - - what is this world coming to? At least your work with Asiana will remain timeless.
I think when you lose fat, it's gets softer first and then disappears.  Anyone else feel that way? #fatloss
If last night's fight was the fight of the century, the sport has just died. Agree? #boxing
I can hold out much longer than she can. Heck - I can go back to porn and be very happy. Just watch.
I politely asked if I could help clean up after last nights party. I get a one word answer - "no."  I'm done. No more texting from me.
Last night's fight was boring. They were laughing their way to the bank the whole time. It was bad for the sport of boxing. Agree? #boxing
@MsMichelleLacy Good morning to you too.
Last night I went to a boxing party at this woman's house. I would have felt so left out if she hadn't. Idk - I can't afford her.
I'm drinking a ton of water before my 9:30 workout. 15 minutes of stretching too. #workout #stretch.
My leg is 100% better. I also slept like a rock. Not texting this woman. Let's see if she misses me. If I love her, I can let her go.
@ireneboss That looks so good. I'm going to eat the rainbow too. Thanks for showing us that, IreneBoss.
Time for some traffic problems?  How about some time for legal and jail problems now?  Let's see how that feels. #Bridgegate
@brattybunny Happy belated May Day, Bumny!
It's good to see that England has a new Princess. Congratulations!
@BratMabel Is findom your favorite, Mabel? I know you like cuck, humil, b'mail, joi and sph too.
@snapgirlz is this something new?  All of a sudden I see it everywhere.
@Emma_Ink I don't like hot weather either, Emma. It makes my commute to work uncomfortable. Hot and humid in a suit and tie is awful.
@Emma_Ink I think you're very pretty, Emma. Thank you for making great clips for us to watch.
This woman said she "promoted me from slave to housekeeper." I bought stuff, folded laundry, organized her sock drawer, did dishes and swept
My wife say I got my hair cut too short. Who cares? It always grows back. Beware of men who care about their hair. #shorthairdontcare.
She seems to be going out of her way not to see me. She's having me do stuff for her but she won't see me. I don't like how it feels.
@GODDESSCHEYENNE I should have known you'd been there before - someone as lovely as you.
@GODDESSCHEYENNE Congratulations on getting into the top 50 on c4s. You've just joined an exclusive club. Best wishes for future success! JB
@AlhanaWinterXXX Good luck with your new coffee machine. Use it in good health, Alhana.
@BratMabel Cool - great idea for a clip. Just saying. Lol.
May Day. May Day!  Lol.
I keep having pain behind my knee. Not the knee. Pain where the leg bends. Any suggestions? #kneepain
@mistressmatisse @_Lexie_Smith 23 is so young.
@maggiegreenlive why? What is funny? Did you hear a joke?
Starting  the day off with some planks. #planks
I'm feeling obsessed over her. Losing some freedom over it. But she's all in. I created a monster!
GM twitter friends (you know who you are).  This woman's got me twisted. I'm doing bizarre things and I'm not sure it's good for me.
@CandaceMoon Thats very beautiful, CM.
@bratty_nikki Where are you moving to, brat? #spoiledsnot. #greedything. #homewrecker
Today she told me to buy bread, shrimp, chargers and shirts. Wants me to do dishes and sweep while she's out. I won't see her today either.
I thanked her for letting me serve her. She doesn't know I'm a little sad.
It was a little sad for me. But she seemed very pleased when she got home and saw $50 and shopping and cleaning done.
Today I brought groceries, did her dishes, cleaned cats litter, took out garbage, left $50. All while she hiked. I wasn't allowed to see her
I find as I get older, I care less about what others think about me. I feel some freedom in that. But I still fear getting too old.
@Briana_Lee_xx You must have unrealistically high expectations. You're so young and impressive.
@ireneboss I don't drink at all. I also heard eating late at night adds weight. But I do kickboxing now and it helps a great deal.
@ireneboss Do you not eat bread?
@ireneboss Wow that's impressive. I lost 20 and I'm so happy.
@LatinaGoddessFD The good thing about her is that she's intelligent and easily influenced.
@LatinaGoddessFD She's not a pro Domme. I'm slowly converting her from vanilla to mistress. But I have to go slow. Don't want to scare her.
@LatinaGoddessFD I have to be careful it doesn't come across as criticism. When the time is right I'll let her know I appreciate kindness.
@LatinaGoddessFD That's a good idea. Sometimes I'm afraid to ask because it might anger her. I think I'll make a face showing I'm upset.
When she gives me tasks, she can do so with kindness. It doesn't have to be forceful. How can I change her approach? Lead by example?
But being her slave should not mean that she can be rude to me. How can I encourage her to be more polite?
Question - I am a slave to this woman. We've reached near complete slavery and there's a meeting of the minds on that point.
@SaraLuvvXXX Congratulations!  Lol
@JoannaAngel Yep, you're officially a Milf. Welcome to the club!
@Princess_Kali It's a great accomplishment. Can't wait to read it. I've need doing a lot of humil stuff lately. I'm sure it will resonate.
@Princess_Kali A humiliation book - how exciting!
What does everyone think about the riot in Baltimore?
What does everyone think about the earthquake in Nepal?
@PrincessSierra I don't use bitcoin. And I really don't know much about it either.
@DantePosh Thank you, Dante. I will read your comments.
@DantePosh I don't think she's a good leader, Dante. Showed poor judgment and now she's defensive. Do you feel that way too, Dante?
@SexyAsianaStarr I don't like zambaio either, Asiana.
@MeetMadden09 Good morning to you too, Madden.
She said she liked the sheets. Now she wants to "come to an agreement" on her laundry. Says she has too many clothes.
I bought new sheets for her and made her bed. Folded laundry and got some groceries. Hope she likes it. She gets home soon. Got flowers too.
I'm getting a car wash. #carwash
Today I did her dishes, swept up and took out the trash. Played with her cat too. I do do other stuff too. Just saying what I do with Her.
@AnnieShamesYou Yes you look pretty in that robe, Princess Annie. #pretty. #brat. #snotty
I'm working out in 30 mins. Drinking lots of water now. Then stretch for 15 mins. I lost 20 lbs. She called me the incredible shrinking man.
@TheKimmieKaBoom @MrDarrellKaBoom Wow you sure are pretty, Kimmie.
She told me to clean better in kitchen. She plans to show me how to organize her clothes.
I dropped the boots at her house. They didn't fit - too small. I got the size she said. Receipt was in bag. Hope she has it.
Yesterday I had dinner with her. Then we each went out - her with love interest and me with wife. Then I bought her new hiking boots.
@Briana_Lee_xx hi to you too!
@Roxie_Rae yes
@SarahPeachez You don't have to go to work, Sarah? Your boss lets you take off?
@AnnieShamesYou Wow what a trophie.
@WorshipMackayla I would like to see cuck, humil, findom, joi, and femdom pov with your feet, socks and tee shirt.
@princessxjodie yes - extremely excited, Princess Jodie.
Yesterday I shopped and cleaned for her while she went to love interest's house. Today she wants to hike with me.
@mom_goddess you're pretty.
@OriginalRigger @SexyAsianaStarr  Can't stop thinking about her toes, Martin. Thanks for letting see them!
@lelulovexo And your fans are so ready to watch you, Lelu.  lol.
@SexyAsianaStarr I like your attitude (and your cute toes), Asiana! Lol.
@lelulovexo Good morning to you too, Lelu. Good luck on your move.  How exciting!
She lets me in her house by myself now to do chores.
Yesterday I cleaned her dishes and took her garbage out - - while she was out with her new love interest at a show. Also left $ on table.
@rachelaziani Good morning to you too. That pool and those toes look good from my cubicle. Thanks for sharing, Rach.
@RileyReidx3 I know what you mean but I had to get up early for work. Don't you have to get up early for work too, Riley?
@bratty_nikki @MissTierra You look pretty, Miss Tierra. And so do you, Bratty Nikki - you look so spoiled and bratty.
@brattybunny @silly_old_man You probably don't have to because you sell so many clips.
I want to tell this woman how much I enjoy doing her laundry and cleaning and shopping for her. Will she think I'm weird and dump me?
@bratty_nikki that's great news for a spoiled snotty brat.
@humiliatrix Thank you for being a great humiliator, Melissa.
@bratty_nikki @SpoiledAshley_ Must be nice to slow down when it's hot out. I dread the hot humid summers and wearing a suit and tie.
@CandaceMoon I'm ok, CM. Thanks for asking. It's Monday - you know how dreadful that is for me though.
@CandaceMoon Morning to you too, CM.
@SydneyScreams4u @hotfattygirl How beautiful are the two of you!
@AdrienneAdora that's a good way (the right way) to look at it.
Nothing happened with her today. She's got a new love interest and she spent the day with him. I wanted to respect her privacy, give space.
@AstroDomina nice footage, Astro!
@lelulovexo Oh ok - sorry. Should have known. Must be someone else's wedding. Enjoy!
I did her laundry yesterday and bought her sox and some groceries. I enjoyed folding the laundry!
@lelulovexo Are you getting married, Lelu?
If anyone whose been following my adventures with this woman over the past few months has ideas or feedback for me, I'd love to hear it.
Anyway...it was quite an adventure for me. She also had me sit with her while she got her legs waxed. I never saw that before. 1st time 4 me
And we talked the whole time. She keeps talking about really cool stuff with me. She says she wants to get whips and use them on me.
But we kept hiking.  We each had small but powerful flashlights. It was so exciting for me. We brought sandwiches from Subway with us too.
After that, we went for a hike. It started to get dark but we kept going..deeper and deeper into the woods. It soon became pitch black.
Hello twitter friends....here is an update on me if you're interested:  Yesterday I took her a mani/pedi and sat with her. After that...
@greeneyed9 Wow youre pretty strong. While you get stronger, I rot away and get weaker, but I guess you like that.
Things are developing with her in spurts. Still haven't gotten to foot worship.  I suggested it a few times, planted seed, but no bites yet.
Its great.  It took almost 9 months of convincing...but she has turned from a vanilla girl into a princess/domme.  We both like it.
I cleaned up in her house - did dishes, swept, cleaned cat litter, took out garbage. She now refers to me as her slave, and I serve her.
This woman called me the incredible shrinking man today (haha). Today I had dinner with her. Then did her grocery shopping and cleaned...
Hello to all my friends. I haven't been here for a while.  Just taking a break.  This are going well. My weight is really down.
@brattybunny Enjoy your bike ride while I rot in a cubicle, bunny. #Spoiledbrat #snottybrat #wealthywoman
@lelulovexo I hope so too, Lelu. My boss leaves early today so it might too!
@lelulovexo Just sitting in my stuffy crowded cubicle all day, Lelu.
@AnnieShamesYou Thank you. I will look for it. #sweetgirl
@AnnieShamesYou What is sprouted bread? I would like to try it.
@SexyAsianaStarr How beautiful you are, Asiana!
I think if I continue being polite and respectful, she'll keep me around.
I'm officially her slave now - she actually uses that language. She confides in me too. It's intimate but I have to behave very carefully.
Nothing sexual happens and hopefully never will. I just like serving her. This was the first time we just sat and she gave me little things.
While I was there, we talked. I did dishes, put her dirty gym clothes in hamper, brought water to her as she watched TV, etc. It was so nice
This woman told me to lose weight and I obeyed. Yesterday I brought groceries to her and she let me sit with her for an hour.
I fit into suits I bought 6 years ago when I was sick. I found two that I never even wore. I'm happy about that.
I've been working out a lot the past 6 weeks. Lost 15 lbs and many inches in waste.
@mistressmatisse Did you break up with your bf 4 years ago? I bet he's kicking himself.
Good morning to all my twitter friends - - you know who you are. Lol.
Hello everyone.  I took a slight break from twitter, but I'm still here.  Lol.
@PrincessSierra That's a nice thing to have them do. It will help them save up money for you.
@KatieBanksDD Didn't you have to get up early for work, Katie?  It's Monday.
@PrincessSierra Tell her to keep her cats off your propery, Princess Sierra.
Today she just had me drop off some groceries. I didn't even get to see her. It's frustrating when she does that but I won't give up. Never!
Next level will be foot worship I hope. We will also have a discussion about laundry and how intimate it is.  I also mailed to her today.
She's learning that she can't break my spirit like she can with a boyfriend. Shes never met anyone like me.  I'm optimistic.
...like it was ok.  Later in the day we exchanged very kind and respectful text messages.  I was busy with family.  She went with a friend.
...just drop off a gift cert and some $ under my door."  She thought I would be upset (and I was), but I just obeyed her and acted like it..
She said I could, but then I realized she may be meeting her friends so I declined. There was a little tension. She said "np - just drop..
She said she wanted to meet at 3:30 at her favorite dress store, but at 1:45 she told me she was going to a mall.  I asked if I could go.
So today we did not meet.  I saw her at a meeting and texted a bit. We were supposed to get together to buy a dress but there was a mixup.
@MistressKelly84 thank you so much. It's a dream come true.
@MistressKelly84 Thank you for favoriting my tweet, Mistress Kelly.
Happy Passover to everyone!
@JennaJayden happy Easter to you too.
Maybe I worship with her socks on? Anyone have any ideas on how to do foot worship without touching skin?
Now that this is done, meh next goal is for her to allow foot worship. She doesn't let me touch her at all right now so this won't be easy.
It was intimate as she showed me how her panties get stained and how I must apply stain remover to that spot. She'll let me do this again.
...bring clothes back to her apt, do dishes and sweep up. While clothes were in dryer, i went shopping for a few things for her.
She also taught me how to clean her cat's litter. She went out after clothes were in washer. Told me to finish laundry, bring clothes back,
Yesterday she took me to the laundromat and taught me how to do her laundry. Even showed me where she stains and how to use stain remover.
@BaileyJayTweets @brattybunny That's right.  Its not called brekkie.
@audipenny @fluffysuse This is the wisest thing I heard all week.  Thank you, Audrey and Fluffy!
I'm very excited to learn these things because I can be more useful to her.  I'm quite nervous actually.
She just told me that today she will teach me how to do her laundry and change her cat's litter. She'll contact me when she's done hiking.
@MistressKelly84 you have beautiful hands, Mistress Kelly.
She's will teach me how to change her cat's litter.  And she asked me to paint her entertainment center.  I view all this as a growth spurt.
The next challenge for me is to convince her to allow me to worship her feet...some seeds have been planted..I need to be patient.
Today she gave me a shopping list and told me to do her dishes while she is out (she left her house key for me).
She now refers to me frequently as her slave or servant. She is talking about teaching me how to do her laundry.
GM twitter friends.  Things are moving nicely to the next level with this woman.  The seeds I've been planting are beginning to sprout,
@MistressKelly84 And I really like that one toe has more glitter than the others.  It makes that toe stand out.
@MistressKelly84 What pretty toes!
GN twitter friends...not much contact with her today...i'm letting her come to me...trying not to burn out the relationship.
I'm hoping to take a break from this woman. Had minimal contact yesterday and I liked it. A short break is good for a relationship.
Today I bought another dress for her before she went dancing. J went to the store with her, held the ones she wanted to try on, etc.
@DakotaCharms I can't even see the picture.
After dinner, she beat me. Then we went shopping. I also bought her a small frying pan at Sears.
Today she cooked dinner for me. Then she took me shopping and I bought her a dress and stockings. Then she went dancing and I went home.
@KristiMaxx Good morning to you too.
I'm going to have a huge steak lunch in a few hours.
I didn't see her today but only because my work commitments were too much. Otherwise she would have met me for lunch and museum in NYC.
I'm taking a bath. Any objections? #bath
I feel like I'm starting to get back in shape - feeling ripped - very optimistic. Kickboxing and dieting are paying off. Making a comeback.
As she was headed out on her overnight trip, she told me she was "on route" to NYC, instead of "en route."  How adorable!
Today I made scrambled eggs for the first time in many years!
@little_mina69 @PiperLynn69 Good luck in your new venture, Piper Lynn. What is your new business venture about if I may ask?
The next thing she wants me to do is to get a massage with her.
@lelulovexo Thank you, Lelu. I look forward to it.
@doggie4Princess @Onmyknees4Her @MistressTdotnet @EnglishMansion @MsEllaKros My goodness - what will you think of next? How exciting!
@ontherhodes @LynnPops you are both so pretty.
@lelulovexo I mean to say "tour," not "your" regarding my request for a video tour of your new house, Lelu. I'm sorry I typed too fast.
@lelulovexo Will you give us a your of your new house, Lelu?
“@NYMag: Caffe Dante will become an unbearably trendy small-plates restaurant: 
@MissTierra Can you please let me follow tou, Miss Tierra. I promise to keep quiet. Thank you.
Today she plans to go away after work &amp; stay at a hotel for a benefit. But thurs she plans to drive into NYC &amp; meet me 4 museum and dinner!
I met her at the nail salon yesterday. They know me there now. I had tea with her while she got a pedicure. I paid of course.
@AnnieShamesYou And filming clips must take a lot of time too.
@CandaceMoon Yes I would like more stuff about working, commuting, being sleepless, and wearing suits and ties in heat and humidity.
@AnnieShamesYou Wow I had no idea. You make it look easy. I will ask the others now.
@AnnieShamesYou Does being online take a lot of your time, Annie?
@CandaceMoon I appreciate the encouragement, CM. It makes my long noisy crowded commute more bearable.
I'm glad I don't smoke anything.
@homeworkslave87 @QueenZanita Thank you. I forgot to mention I've been drinking lots of water all day long.
@LaughingLatina I wouldn't be surprised if you hear from him again, Jasmine. $500 is an awful lot of money.
Tonight I take her for a pedicure. I bring her tea and sit next to her.
I had cereal with 2% milk and banana for b'fast. Lunch: turkey on whole wheat, lettuce, tomato, hot pepper. No mayo.
@CandaceMoon Do more cubicle and commuting stuff, CM. Please.
@CandaceMoon hello hello CM. Thanks again for making clips about my work. Makes me have to spoil you more and more. #addictedtocandace
@Bryci it must be nice to stay home. I have a long commute everyday.
@Bryci Glad you're enjoying Monday, Bryci. For me it's the start of a week in a stuffy noisy crowded cubicle. You don't deal with that?
Well I had my day in the city with her, and it went off quite well.  We went to a museum and had dinner. Then I drove her home.
Ok - so she agreed to go with me but I have to wait for her to get ready. And it's late in the day - I'd prefer not to go now.
@GemmaLinx @GemmaLynx @manyvids
She wouldn't commit to going to NYC tomorrow. I predict she's not going. I say that because she didn't ask what we would do.
Then she sent me grocery shopping. She gave me a shopping list and told me to drop the stuff at her door and leave. I also got flowers.
When I asked to come closer to see her toes, she refused to allow me to get up from the chair. We talked for an hour. Then she sent me...
...would not let me sit in the living room with her. I had to sit in the dining room. She said she wants me to take her for pedi next week.
I swear when she's barefoot she knows she's driving me mad. She had me fix her tea and place it on a table near her. She would not let me..
When I arrived at her house she was wearing a sleeveless tee shirt and tight fitting pajama pants. She was barefoot laying on the couch.
Today she met me at a shoe store - bought her boots and purse. Then she had me go to her house. But I had to get tea on my way.
I realize a successful trip to NYC with her will happen only if she has the desire. Last thing I want is a bad trip which would ruin things.
Actually if she doesn't go with me to NYC, it may be for the best. It's up to her. I will not try to convince her.
I'm torn - if I ask her to go to NYC too early, I appear anxious and it turns her off. Too late, I miss out. Timing is a delicate issue.
I'm hoping this Sunday she lets me take her into NYC, go to museums and spend the day with her. It's a possibility. We'll see.

@CandaceMoon Hello hello CM. You're an early bird today.  Lol
@Briana_Lee_xx You still have privacy. Some people think they know everything.
@brattybunny You always look great, Bunny. You never let your fans down.
I've seen this woman 9 of the past 10 days. it's been like this for months. We eat, hike, talk she beats me, I do chores for her, etc.
@CandaceMoon I'm alway off my schedule. My whole like is off-schedule CM. lol.
@CandaceMoon Pretty good CM. Thanks for asking.
@CandaceMoon You're behind already CM?  It's only 7:30am.
@CandaceMoon Morning CM. Hello hello.
@maggiegreenlive I'm awake too, but barely. Lol.
And just now she thanked me. I love doing her dishes. I'm hoping she teaches me to do her laundry.
Today I hiked and had dinner with her. Then she went out, but sent me to her house to do her dishes and put left-overs in the fridge.
@SevereSociety @FetishDirector I predict the accountant will have the most fun. Lol.
@MercyForAnimals @SevereSociety What cute pigs!
@KJDangerDoll Thank you for favoriting my tweet, Kayla Jane. Coming from you, it means so much to me. You made my day!
@KJDangerDoll I feel the same way. I don't observe st Patricks day and I don't want to hear or see drunk people today
I was told to write 25 thing I expect or want get out of the slave role I'm in. She wants to understand me more. Any suggestions?
@CandaceMoon I'm ok CM. Thanks for asking.
@CandaceMoon hello hello CM.
@maggiegreenlive I need coffee too.
@SydneyScreams4u Ok I'll drink a lot of water. Thank you for telling me.
@MotherJones
@SydneyScreams4u You just inspired me to take a walk on my lunch hour Sydney.
@CandaceMoon ok, a fresher version would be nice. And do you have one with basil?
@CandaceMoon Those sound like great recipes, Candace. Thank you!
A third person just did it. I see a pattern but not sure what if anything it means.
So far this morning two people said good morning and said my name, but I didn't know their name.
I decided I want to make my own tomato / spaghetti sauce - - what Italian people call gravy. Does anyone have a good recipe I can use?
Sometimes I wonder - - what have I become?  How did I get like this? What happened to me? Who am I?  But sometimes I don't wonder.
Hanging out with her is running into too much money too fast -this may cause me to put the brakes on. I will come to my senses soon &amp; crash.
GM - yesterday I had breakfast with her, shopped and delivered her groceries, bought 3 blouses for her. She beat me with a belt too -hard!
@DantePosh Enjoy the ski slopes, Dante. Have a great day!
@LaughingLatina Are you on the rise, Jasmine?
@SexyAsianaStarr thanks for favoriting my tweet, Asiana.
I lost about 15 pounds. 10 more and I am good. Feels good to walk around with less weight. Tie my shoes without strain is nice too.
@hotfattygirl I hope it's getting better, Ivy.
@AmyLeen_Moore You must make so much money behind an internationally famous Domme.
@hotfattygirl It doesn't look too swollen. Is it painful?
@CandaceMoon Pretty good, CM. It's Friday. How R u?
@CandaceMoon Hello hello, CM.
So things are progressing well with her. But I have to be careful not to appear creepy or obsessive.
She asked me to write 25 of the things that I hope to get out of out relationship. She also asked me to write our long and short term goals
I hiked and had dinner with her yesterday. At dinner we reviewed my list of 50 ways to be respectful and serve her needs.
@camillehugh I haven't adjusted sodium. Do you recommend I halt the salt?
@Briana_Lee_xx Thank you for answering me.
@brookeplayhouse Beach day?  Don't you two have to work today?
@Briana_Lee_xx Will you wear green during your st Patricks day show?
@DreamnetRob wow you must live in a nice area.
@CandaceMoon Looking forward to it, CM.
@Lynda_Liberty You're very pretty.
@MsMariaMoore Haha I do that too!
@LaughingLatina So what will you do instead of laying around?
She reached out to me today. She's not angry w/me. Wants to hike &amp; resume beatings (said aggression is part of her plan to get over ex-bf).
@CandaceMoon Best of luck on your new store, CM. What is the theme?
We reviewed it over dinner.  I blew her away. She laughed and laughed. And then I lost her key. I'm so sad. I hope she comes back.
I also have her a typewritten list of 50 ways to be respectful to her and serve her needs. She requested I do that. We reviewed it ....
I knocked the key down behind a fixture and it's now gone. Last thing she said to me was "don't text me anymore.l. I also gave her a....
...she sent me to her house to do her dishes, sweep up and take garbage out. She told me where he hides her key. It's in a secret spot....
Last night I had dinner with her at red lobster (her choice).  She went out with friends after dinner. But she sent me to her house...
Oh my gosh - things got so strange tonight with her. It was the best of times; it was the worst of time - - the tale of a man divided.
I'm meeting her for hiking in a few minutes. I asked her if I could go and she said yes. I hope she doesn't stand me up. #hiking #excited.
@UrGodAngel Good advice - thanks.
@KristiMaxx You sure did!
I've been working out and eating right but not losing much weight. I look better though. Any ideas why not much weight loss?
Did some grocery shopping and bought roses for her today. Just dropped the stuff off at her door. We texted but didn't speak today (yet).
She said our relationship has just begun and that we have many adventures ahead of us. Tonight she's trying to meet a new man. #cuck #findom
I shopped alone while she worked out at gym. She texted shopping instructions and told me to enjoy shopping. She knows I like being used.
She had me shop at three stores for her today and I helped with her laundry. Then had tea at her house. No beatings. I shopped alone.
Yesterday I took her for a mani pedi. I paid and sat with her. Bought her tea. Today I had breakfast with her.
@ChicasPlace Do you enjoy skiing, Chica?
I just finished kickboxing. Kicked my ass! Now I'm taking a hot bath. Very hot bath. What are y'all doing?
@CravingUnknown You two make a great couple. Nothing but love to you!
@jasoninja Hey buddy - you still king of the brats?  Lol.
@bratty_nikki  I just spent 6 hours in a noisy stuffy hot cubicle. And I have to wear a tie tied tightly around my neck. I feel great too!
@SpoiledAshley_ I want to hike too but I have to stay in my cubicle. I will get in trouble with my boss if I don't stay there.
@UberFacts Can you imagine if he taught her 4 chords? Lol.
@LaughingLatina Thank you for favoriting my tweet. That means so much to me!
@GemmaLinx Yay for Friday!
@LaughingLatina Good morning to you too!
@Roxie_Rae Thank you so much for favoriting and RTing my tweet, Roxie. That means so much to me.
@rachelaziani What lovely nails, Rachel.
@Roxie_Rae That's a great attitude, Roxie. It's so important for me to take responsibility for my feelings. No ones fault but my own.
@lelulovexo oh. Good luck house hunting!
@lelulovexo Are you house hunting, Lelu?  I thought you moved into a new house recently?
@AmyLeen_Moore Morning AmyLeen.
She has asked me to take her somewhere for waxing. I have no experience with this. Any suggestions would be so welcome.
@brattybunny He's so fortunate to have you. We are all insanely jealous of him, Bunny. It ruins our lives and makes us miserable.
Back to reality - today I work my ass off. Then play hard. I help with her nails, get her tea and sit with her while she gets mani / pedi.
Good morning. It's so cold here. 12 degrees. Last night was interesting. She was depressed. I took her out. Cleaned her car off too.
@MyDearDarcy Thank you for favoriting my tweet, Mistress Darcy. It means a lot to me.
@CandaceMoon how odd! Lol
Today she wanted dinner and shopping, but I told her I did not have much availability.  I said I wanted to do kick boxing too.
@spankamber That's great, Amber. Hope you enjoyed it. I've been in a noisy stuffy hot cubicle all day. What do you think of that?
@bratty_nikki More clips? Wow, you're a busy bratty spoiled snot.
@IsobelWren That's why I don't go to whole foods. And who wants to food from communal bins?
@bratty_nikki Good morning, Nikki. Sounds like you're having a hectic day. Try to find time to relax.
@brattybunny Don't you or your boyfriend have to get up early for a long commute to work?
@xNikkiSilverx @ontherhodes Thanks I'll have to check it out. I'm a big fan of Missy Rhodes.
@SockDreams Glad I found you, sick dreams! I like sox a lot.
My stomach hurts and I'm chilly. She told me she's not hungry anymore and is staying in. I want to see her...even for a few minutes.
@KaylaJanePOV @KJDangerDoll Very pretty, Kayla.
@chantarose Glad you're feeling better, Chanta.  You bring much joy to this (sometimes horrible) world.
@DantePosh I like the cold too. Good for walking as long as you bundle up.
@ArielRebel @Briana_Lee_xx Yes well said.
@brattybunny Thank you for favoriting my tweet about you, Bunny. Coming from you, it means so much to me. #thankyou
@MissVikkiLynn New vlog. How exciting! Thank you. Can't wait to read it.

@bratty_nikki @AnabellePync @SpoiledAshley_ Pretty Princess brats. Cute findommy home-wreckers. Sweet spoiled snotty wealthy girls.
@PrincessLexieXO You're not only bitchy, Prin Lex - you're bratty, spoiled, snotty, greedy, cruel, findommy, home-wrecky, and pretty.
@SpoiledAshley_ Your hair looks good with your pretty green eyes, Prin Ash. #pretty.
@brattybunny You just keep rising, Bunny. More followers, more money, better house and cars, more respect and fame. You're very impressive.
I saw her very briefly as we walked to our cars, and I gave her flowers.  I enjoyed being polite to her.
@Stud4QK thank you for saying hello to me, King.
@Stud4QK Hello king!
@lelulovexo It's nice that you get to visit a zoo instead of sitting in a stuffy office on Monday. Your hard work paid off, Lelu.
@QueenKittyOwnsU Very pretty toes, Kitty. #nicetoes
She's having me replace the flowers that her ex-boyfriend gave her. I'll buy them after work and give them to her. I'm going to get ones.
Having salad for lunch now. I may see her tonight at a meeting. She said "we" are going.  I'm coaching her through the breakup with her bf.
I had yogurt. I'm feeling better.
I worked out early this morning and now I'm starving. Does anyone have experience being hungry after they work out?
@SexyAsianaStarr @OriginalRigger Do you drive a Mercedes Benz, Asiana?
@SexyAsianaStarr @FletchersTire it's amazing how sloppy people are.
GM. Cooling down from kickboxing. What a workout!
@LaughingLatina Wow you travel a lot.
@annieshamesyou Did you have a lot if income last year, Princess Annie?
@humiliatrix @MarceloSlave Congrats from me too.
I need to be nicer to my wife.
I signed up for kickboxing today. Not to learn to fight. Just to get in shape. I want to lose 15 more pounds.
@CandaceMoon I'm doing well, CM. But it sounds like you had a great time with your friends. Sydney Screams is great!
@CandaceMoon @SydneyScreams4u @MsWhitneyMorgan @CamilleBlackxxx @TheRealNyxon What nice group of ladies!
Having breakfast with her.
@SpoiledAshley_ Congrats Prin Ash. Keep up the good work.
In addition to breakfast, beating and hiking, i could have had dinner with her but I was busy. She spends a lot of time with me.
Her boyfriend dumped her. I'm hurting for her. I have feelings for her. And I'm the only one she told. What the hell is happening?
@WorshipRene It uses cyclonic action which breaks down cell walls to release nutrients too, Princess Rene.
@bratty_nikki Good morning, Brat.
@brattybunny  I also hiked in the snow today, Bunny!
Jenny Craig was closed but tomorrow I'm checking out Jenny Craig and kickboxing.
I'm going to check out Jenny Craig now.
Just finished hiking with her. In the snow! I had so much fun!  And she did too.  I took pictures of her too.
After breakfast she too me to her house and beat me. I'm hoping to home with her this afternoon.
@PrincessSierra Sounds like it's right up your alley, Princess Sierra. Lol
@DantePosh Yes, thank you Dante. She beat me after breakfast today.
I'm having breakfast with her. Later today I'm helping her with laundry. And she wants to hike too. Even though it's only 20 here.
Dinner is over. It was very pleasant.
She picks the worst restaurants and I have to wait and listen to lousy music or babies crying. Right now it's lousy music.
She ended up contacting me. So I'm waiting in a restaurant now to have dinner with her. I plan to tell her how I feel about her 50 items!
Well she hasn't summoned me yet. I suspect she won't as it's getting past her dinner time. Just as well.
@ChicasPlace Chica! It's so cold here and you're sitting outside?  #jealous
I'm ready for disappointment but prepared to thank her for letting me know. And I will wish her a good evening.
The latest is that she's home but wants to rest. She says she'll summon me if and when she decides to eat. Sio now I just wait. #nervous
@bratty_nikki No one is more if a greedy snotty wealthy spoiled stuck up brat than you, Nikki.
@hotfattygirl Wow you're always up to something, Ivy. what color are you painting your cute toes?
@CandaceMoon @fetishontheweb I liked Spock too.
Rest in peace, Spock. #Spock
In the meantime I started organizing the 50 ways I can be respectful and serve her needs.
I said I do know my place and thanked her for teaching me. She said she may consider forgiveness. So the story continues...
She said she may want food at 6 today. I responded politely. She approved of my tone and said I now know my place.,,,
@CandaceMoon Yes, some people are like dogs.
@CandaceMoon She wants all your attention.
@CandaceMoon Animals don't care about size.
@CandaceMoon Who is it bullying, CM?
@Gothamist I think it's white and gold! Lol.
I'm torn though. Part of me wants to let her go, but I feel I'll never meet anyone like this again. No one has ever done this stuff with me.
I think this is her way of letting me go. Any ideas would be appreciated. A big part of me wants to let go of her.
She is keeping her word and being silent. Should I write the 50 ways to respect and serve? I said I would but I'm thinking maybe not.
If this is the end, it's good that she has her dignity. My last message was a plea to her. I'd rather she have her dignity than I have mine.
I listen to this and all is well. I'll be ready when she comes back!

Wife just landed. I have to treat her extra special. It will help me deal with my ordeal with the other woman. I hope she forgets me.
Cardio. Then pick up wifey at airport.
I expect her next message to me will be blocking me. Oh well, I got what i asked for. It seems to be over now. Not writing the 50 items.
So now I'm getting the silent treatment. Another message from me at this point would be wrong. So now I sit in the mess I made.
After all that I just asked her to reconsider. I'm hopeless. I surrender. Help me please.
The most important thing is that I do no harm to her. She can end on her terms. I prefer to end on a high note but she comes first.
Right now I'm breathing easy. I do want her to do well. Throughout this ordeal, I owned my feelings and didn't blame her for anything.
She has every right to end it. And if  she wants it ended on her terms, I'm all for it. She did say we'd resume all activities in one week.
I will place my focus on wifey which is where it belongs. I wasn't rude to her. I think it may be her way if ending things on her terms.
Cont'd... 2: it's going to be a relief for me. I've been doing this dance since sept now. It's exhausting. My wife gets home tonight.
Now she is "punishing" me with no contact for one week. She said its because I was rude. 2 thing - it's immature. Adults can talk. 2...
She now wants me to write out 50 ways I will meet her needs and respect her authority.
Now she says she was hurt by how I treated her, but she won't tell me what I did. I'm not a mind reader!
@brattybunny I'm sorry Bunny. I will be quiet.
@brattybunny B'mail, cute toes, fat ugly old wife, bf gets me and you Jo, I go to beach while you sweat in hot suit in city, buy me clothes.
@brattybunny Cuck, humil, homewrecker, sph, joi, jailbird, findom, chastity, virgin Jo, long commute 4 U, work longer, old but can't retire
@SexyAsianaStarr Wear a pretty dress, Asiana.
@Princess_lyne @MissVikkiLynn I try, Princess Lyne. Lol.
Cereal, 2% milk, banana for b'fast. Large salad for lunch. Very little dressing. Salad had hot peppers which i enjoyed. #somethingnew
@DantePosh I don't even know what the truth is sometimes, Dante. I'm not all that well unfortunately. But thank you so much for responding.
@DantePosh I plan do that if she lets me talk to her. I couldn't do it via text.
@CandaceMoon I'm not well, CM. Not well at all. This woman has me twisted! I'm not reaching out. I hope she just forgets about me.
@CandaceMoon
But I felt awful last night. I can't blame her though. It's all my fault. She doesn't deserve to be around me and my sick ideas and feelings
I'm realizing I don't feel good when I'm around this woman. Maybe it's because it's such a secretive sick friendship.
...to ask whether I'm ok. I told her I was upset at work. She said she was sorry she can't give me ALL her attention. Not good.
Today I was moody around her and she asked if I was ok. She thought I felt that way because of her. She was right. It's unusual for her ...
@LaughingLatina Exciting
She taunted me today. At some point I will lose interest but that hadn't happened yet. But losing interest is in sight.
@Briana_Lee_xx Sometimes the cold weather makes me feel like staying indoors too, but once I get outside I feel better.
Lately, I've been enjoying sips of warm water. And I don't like when people imitate me.
Had cereal 2% milk and banana for breakfast. Now salad for lunch. Just because I'm miserable over this woman, doesn't mean I have to be fat.
@Princess_lyne @MissVikkiLynn Is it hard to go back to work after such a long vacation, Princess Lyne?
@CandaceMoon morning CM
She was with her boyfriend tonight and didn't even text me. I miss her, but I guess I have I wait my turn to be with her. #sad
@SpoiledAshley_ And February had less days too. That makes it even more impressive. Congratulations Spoiled Ashley! #successfulwoman.
@starbondmedia Who will win? Your brain or your bank? Lol.
@CravingUnknown where will you go? Will you ever come to NYC?
@CravingUnknown Are you a nomad yet?
Doing cardio now. Still haven't heard from her. Patience is a virtue. I know she got a package today. So she didn't forget me. Lol.
@AnnieSprinkle Did you visit show world center, Annie?
@SpoiledAshley_ @AllyOnlinex @VictoriasSecret I stand corrected, Spoiled Ashley. Cray cray it is. Thanks for correcting me. #sweetgirl
@SpoiledAshley_ @AllyOnlinex @VictoriasSecret Wow that's cre cre (slang for crazy).
I think I'll have homemade lasagna for dinner. I'm starved. Had cereal nuts and fruit all day. Do cardio later tonight.
She hasn't texted me. Just as well. If I see her too much, the relationship will burn out. But I'm so curious about what she's doing.
I'm assuming she's buying food to cook for her boyfriend tonight. So I'm not getting my hopes up for dinner.
@Princess_lyne I approach you with much respect, Princess Lyne. You do great work. Thank god for women like you!
@LaughingLatina Thank you so much for favoriting my tweet. Coming from you, it means so much to me. I have deep respect for you, Ms Mendez!
She said I owe her $20 for my stupidity because I didn't clear all items on her shopping list correctly. She's catching on! #cute #adorable
@TarantinoXXX @ConorCoxxx @ConnorCoxxx done. He's blocked.
@AstroDomina Yeah but will our sox come off, Astro? Lol.
Overall she sees me more than her bf but she can change that at any time so I have to be ready when she summons me. #readyforaction
She told me I'm not allowed to text her first. I have to wait for her to reach out and only then am I allowed to text with a reply.
I hope she contacts me today. She said she wasn't seeing her bf today but she changes her mind a lot. I want to eat dinner with her again.
@ConorCoxxx I hope they get in trouble. You do great work, sir. And thank you for keeping the girls happy for the rest of us who are alone.
@MsMariaMoore That's a great elephant, Maria. May it bring you good luck and much wealth!
@MistressTdotnet I did not, MT. Thank you for alerting us. I always enjoy reading your blog. I will read it after work. #greatmistress
@bratty_nikki Good morning. Enjoy your workout, brat. #spoiledbrat #wealthysnot #homewrecker #findom
@CandaceMoon @worshipcandace Nice pair of grapefruits you have there CM.
@LaughingLatina What did you do last night to have fun, Laughing Latina?
Is there anything wrong with cottage cheese and cinnamon?  Go!
@hotfattygirl It's tropical here in NJ too, Ivy. A balmy 7 this morning.
@AshleySinclair0 Hello there, sexy starlet  Lol.
@ArielRebel I look forward to watching your adventures!
I want to look good for this woman.
Breakfast today was raisin bran, skim milk and a banana. I'm trying to lose weight. I lost about 10 pounds in 3 weeks.  My goal is 10 more.
@AmyFreeze Maybe you should call it SuperColdSaturday, Amy. Lol.
@CandaceMoon I'm sorry CM. I'll be more polite.
I'm going to start my day with some espresso. I'm a barista!! Lol.
@CandaceMoon it's cold up here, CM. Record breaking temps! Brrrrr
@CandaceMoon Hello hello CM.
And she said I looked good. lol.  So lots happened today!
She said she's not so sure about her boyfriend. She was angry about something at work. If I came over sooner she said she would've beaten me
I went grocery shopping for her, delivered it and unplaced. Then I met her for dinner at a restaurant.
@LaughingLatina Is it polite to do that?  It's admitting that you were looking which can be rude. What do you think?
@DantePosh I must confess I am guilty of driving with snow on my car. I do try to brush it off, but sometimes it's hard to reach.
@Mistress_Me11y It's warmer here too. Amazingly it's hard to find women that will let me do this stuff with them.
@brattybunny @silly_old_man I do not understand that message either, Bunny and SillyOldMan.
@humiliatrix No one cares about them.
@MistressTdotnet That implies they saw someone better in real life - I doubt that very much.
I will still offer my assistance to her. And do as she says. But from here on, I do not want her time.
I want her to be happy and do well. Spending lots of time with me is not helpful to her.
She's not rejecting me. She's doing what she's supposed to do. I will still help her in any way possible.
I realize I want this woman to be with her new boyfriend. If you love someone, you let them go. I'm good!
@GoddessLycia Drink lots of water for health?
@CandaceMoon hey CM. I'm good. Sorry for not responding sooner. Had a busy day.
@CandaceMoon Pretty good CM. Thanks for asking.
@CandaceMoon Morning Candace. Hello hello.
@DantePosh I imagine that happens often with you, Dante.
@MyDearDarcy I understand. I feel time is the most valuable resource. If I could choose what I'd want more -time or money - time wins.
@MyDearDarcy Sounds like a long trip for just one weekend.  You're probably taking time off from work to go. Suggest taking more days off.
Since I saw this woman twice yesterday (breakfast and lunch), I'm thinking she won't contact me today. Will she? Go!
@Goddess_Lindsey Go to the gym. I'm exercising right now. Doing cardio. Let's exercise together! Lol.
I'm watching Lockup. How horrible it must be to be in prison. It must be a hard life to be locked in a cage all day. The food looks bad too.
She can and will cut me off at any moment. So I must move on. I am no one in her life.
Today I had breakfast and lunch with her and we got haircuts together. She started taking about bondage too. But I see how shaky things are.
@gooner4evr @AshleyFires
She just summoned me for lunch. And told me she's mad at her boyfriend.
@AddieJuniper Wow where are you?
Today we had breakfast and then we each got a haircut. She said she missed me! We haven't seem each other since Tuesday. We talked a lot too
She's acting like nothing happened. We had breakfast. Now we're getting haircuts.
If she ever dumps me, I will never miss this diner.
I hate hearing these babies in this diner. Don't get me wrong - I like kids - a lot. But I don't want to hear their whining.
Or maybe she just wants me to buy something for her. That aspect is sad for me. I should just stick with wife!
I await in the diner .... for adventure? A letdown? Or nothing? Suspenseful!
The vanilla Domme just summoned me to breakfast. I'm ready to go. And ready for her to change her mind too.
Things will never work out for me with these women. I need to just stick with mg wife. What do you think of that? Go!
Good morning!
I activated my Brazilian friend. It will take time but I believe it will be worth it. Feeling like I miss the vanilla Domme much less now.
Time to reactivate the Brazilian. She's on fire i hope. Waiting for instructions on where to meat. #excited #anxious
I'm starting with someone new. Things are ceasing with this other woman (the vanilla Domme). I mourned the loss, shed a tear.I'm done w/her.
@bratty_nikki it must be a nice bag for you to like it so much, Nikki.
@bratty_nikki GM. I'm sitting in a cubicle all day while you're a Princess. #spoilednonworkingwealthtbrat
@ShaunaRyanne You're flying first class, Shauna?

@mikki_sixx Enjoy the Disney on Ice show, Mikki.
@princessxjodie What is your website, Princess Jodie?
It's cold today. -15 wind chill. Actual temp is 2. Brrrrrr!!
@lelulovexo Good morning, Lelu. I'm up early too. Lol
@EroticNikki  I hope your move goes well, Nikki.  And thank you for making such great sites and clips for us. You have great feet too!
So she comes back and says she wants my friendship and suggests dinner tomorrow. I already shed a tear this morning when she said adieu.
@EroticNikki How exciting. Are you getting a big house with a pool?
@EroticNikki Are you moving to Las Vegas, Nikki?
@LaughingLatina @SarahDiavola You are both so pretty. I can see how you control many men.

I had a bowl of cereal with banana and 2% milk for breakfast. Big salad (very little dressing) for lunch - just greens, tomato, etc.
@WorshipRene I know. I was just kidding with you, Princess Rene. Lol.
@bratty_nikki I'm sorry you're not sitting by your pool today, Nikki. I hope tomorrow the weather will improve for you. #sweetprincess
@WorshipRene Wow so many clips! Don't you ever take a vacation, Princess Rene? #hardworker. #needsvacation #richandspoiled
@GemmaLynx Like when they complain about a landscaper?  How fortunate to even own a house or be alive?
I feel a combination of relief and sadness. At least the relationship ends on a high note. Seinfeld stopped filming with the highest ratings
She did the right thing for all involved. Just wish it wasn't done via text message but no one is perfect. We're all human.
Things apparently got too intense so she has "officially" terminated our arrangement. This is understandable but still hurts.
@bratty_nikki It's bitterly ice cold, windy and dreary here, Nikki. And the commuting to work takes extra long too. #spoiledbrat
This weekend I'm free and I will be running. And I run hard. I'm already making plans.
@BratMabel I never thought he was really dominant.
@BratMabel I actually thought it was a pretty boring book. I know a lot of people like it, but I didn't.
@BratMabel Everyone loves you, Brat Mabel.
@GoddessRodea very funny, Goddess Rodea.  At least we can laugh at ourselves. If we can't, who can?
@SexyAsianaStarr Nothing serious for me. Needed my eyes checked. About a year ago the pressure was high. It's normal today and 6 months ago
For someone who has a boyfriend, she sees me a lot. Do you think she likes me? Go!
I saw her 4 days in a row - sun to tues. And today she texts me, but tells me not to text her (that's her game).
@gg_lyn You're so pretty, Milf Gigi.
@SexyAsianaStarr Sorry to hear that. I was actually at the eye doctor today.
@SexyAsianaStarr Your feet are so amazing, Asiana!  I could look at them all day. #prettyfeet.
@DantePosh And I was only given 45 minutes to shop and deliver all that stuff.  So no time for suggestions from me.
@DantePosh I normally would do that, but it's her way or the highway.  Trust me - I tried. But thank you very much for the feedback, Dante.
@JDEVILXXX @CandaceMoon You take good care of Candace, Jdevil.  There's so much ice and snow this year.
So now you all know what I'm dealing with.
With that, she said I'm an idiot who can't do simple things and she should have gotten it herself. Told me to make sure I got everything.
She wanted groceries and a salad from McDonalds. Wanted it at 7pm. That wasn't possible so I said I would bring what I had and make 2 trips.
I don't know my way around a big grocery store, never bought her type of rice, etc. So I told her I needed to make two trips.
She was annoyed by some other things not related to me though. But I didn't shop the right way. Couldn't get everything fast enough.
@AmberLily I just do as I'm told now. This lifestyle caught on with her like wildfire!
She had me take the groceries in, unpack and put them away. But I it the wrong granola bars. That got the angry. So she got her belt...
@AmberLily It's unreal for me, Amber Lily. Beyond my wildest imagination. But it's got me in the grip!
Yesterday she had me shop for groceries and drop them at her door. I did that and she got home at the very moment I was there.
She told me we'd see each other less now that she had a boyfriend. But that's not happening. She keeps coming at me. I never text her first.
I'm a little disappointed with myself. Sunday we had lunch. Monday was nails and ice cream. Tuesday was shopping and beating.
@EaterNY @DantePosh Oh no! Dante is closing. Lol.
@CandaceMoon It's kind of you to talk to us.
@CandaceMoon My weekend was fine. It's very cold here though. It feels like -15!
@TheKimmieKaBoom @MsMariaMoore It's very very cold and windy. The wind chill is -15.
@TheKimmieKaBoom Good morning to you too, Kimmie.
@CandaceMoon GM Candace. You're so beautiful.
@lelulovexo You're so beautiful when you first wake up, Lelu. You don't even need makeup to look great.
@theBlackFuhrer Good morning, Black Fuhrer.  I hope you have a great day.
@MsMariaMoore I don't drink at all, Maria. Not even wine. It's been 15 years.
@Briana_Lee_xx have a good flight, Briana.
@DantePosh @TheFix Glad they cleared that up. It makes much more sense now! Lol.
@jasoninja @Goddess_XTC I noticed that too. Makes the list seem not credible.
@DantePosh I prefer cold to heat anytime.
@DantePosh It's so cold here in NY, Dante. You must be someplace warm.
@CandaceMoon Have fun at Walmart, CM.
@bratty_nikki You should command us Nikkijerkers to stand in the 50mph freezing wind and freeze while you're comfy in 80 degree weather. Brr
@CandaceMoon Why do you have to wear pants CM?  Can't you wear a nice dress too?
Happy valentines day.
@ABC7NY @AmyFreeze7 I can vouch for that. It is cold today. Brrrrrr.
@WorshipRene They must be very wealthy to have a lazy river.  Are they rich, Princess Rene?
@humiliatrix You had a lot to do with it for sure. #addict
@humiliatrix many of us have that fetish. You're not alone!
@Briana_Lee_xx I also like TSA precheck, Briana.
@TheKimmieKaBoom @MrDarrellKaBoom you have your own pens, Kimmie?
@CandaceMoon I just had English muffins with peanut butter and jelly CM. It was pretty good. Maybe you want that too.
Are pickles healthy? Go.
@DantePosh Someone told me it odometer palindrome weekend too, but I'm not sure.
@TheGoddessGreed you must like rainbow cookies.  Do you?
@DantePosh It's also valentines day this weekend. Lol.
@GoddessAmiee You're on a home wrecking streak today, aren't you?  #cutebrat
@DantePosh Happy spooky day to you too, Dante. May it be filled with adventure!
@killerCram GM. And the wind chill is below zero!
@AllisonPataki Just saw your interview on the news. Very impressive!
@bolony correct spelling is Allison Pataki. #allisonpataki.
George Pataki's daughter is amazing. Very impressive. #alisonpataki. Check her out. Just saw her on news.
@CandaceMoon @dcbigoso @killerCram @VidiFutuiVeni Tired overworked sleepless and stressed.
I'm going to hit the stationary bike and get my cardio on. Get some reading done too!  #winwin
@CandaceMoon GM CM.
@TheGoddessGreed That's a lot of marzipan. My favorites. Yummy. #marzipan. Marzipan is the best!
@bratty_nikki @UrBratPrincess @Goddess_Lindsey @SpoiledAshley_ @HakkasanLV Thank god for pretty brats!
It's Friday the 13th.
Other than a few text messages, no contact with her today and yesterday. She wants dinner and shopping tomorrow but she changes mind often.
Oatmeal, bananas, tilapia, broccoli, crappy soup, weight watchers pop, 2 English muffins and jam, oranges, tuna salad, matzoh. Not bad.
@SarahBlakeInc Congratulations Sarah!
@lelulovexo wow how pretty are you, Lelu.
@MopTopV2 @AnabellePync @DakotaCharms @little_mina69 Looks like a fun car to be in. Lol.
@Goddess_Lindsey @bratty_nikki @SpoiledAshley_ wow what a combo of pretty findom brats!
@brattybunny wow how pretty are you, Bunny!
@adoracash Well I never worked at a pancake house, but I fully appreciate how a blast from 30 years ago might be an unwelcome intrusion. Lol
@adoracash Sometimes it's nice to go down memory lane and it's amazing how people change over time.
@adoracash With FB it's easy to reconnect. I reached out to my first from over 30 yrs ago but no reply. It's ok though.
@adoracash A woman that I'm getting to know swears they always come back. And she's proving it to me. Lol.
@AaliyahLove69 @MarceloSlave @Bryci I heard those are good mattresses but very expensive. But I'm not sure.
@adoracash I heard that from someone else. How funny!
@maggiegreenlive Bon voyage, Maggie!
@OriginalRigger @SexyAsianaStarr does Asiana ride those motorcycles too?
@SexyAsianaStarr Well you'll certainly be clean today! Lol.
@mikki_sixx @MeanQueenK wow I wouldn't want to mess with her. Lol.
@SexyAsianaStarr I'm going to try it and let you know if I like it. :)
@SexyAsianaStarr Wow that's a great idea, Asiana! Thank you. #goodfriend  #nicebondage
Sometimes I don't like being married. I just don't like being fussed over and cared for. But when she's away i want her to come back. #crazy
I'm trying to lose weight. I had oatmeal with a banana for breakfast. The oatmeal was sweetened though. I hate plain oatmeal. #oatmeal
@Goddess_XTC You have pretty feet.
@TheKimmieKaBoom Has anyone ever told you that you're pretty?
@Princessannie07 I'm not porky pig! Lol
I though I missed my stop on the train, but I didn't. Whew! #relieved
@princess_laceyx Hi Princess Lacey. You are so pretty!
@Princessannie07 Well I'm trying not to be a butter boy!
@RileyReidx3 Wow you did have funny jobs, Riley.
@Princessannie07 What is a fat tax?  Do you mean flat tax?
@RileyReidx3 Do the porn jobs pay much more, Riley?  What jobs did you have before porn?
@SexyAsianaStarr Thank you, Asiana. Have a great day!
@SarahBlakeInc have a good workout while I sit in my cubicle and get more out of shape, Sarah.
@theBlackFuhrer is Greenville near Greenbo Alabama?
@turbotax Whoa! That is way cool, turbo tax!! No more accountant's fees for me! #taxtime
@KatieBanksDD Wow that is great news. I like acdc too, Katie.
@Princessannie07 I weigh 215, Princess Annie. Thank you for asking.
@MissVioletVega Wow how pretty are you!
@SexyAsianaStarr Hi Asiana, you beautiful thing! Lol.  #prettygirl. #bondagebabe
@Princessannie07 Yes Princess Annie. I was told to lose weight.
@25btls @ItsCleoLive That's Cleo live?
Breakfast: Special K, banana, 2% milk. Lunch: salad w/light dressing, tuna sushi roll. Metamucil throughout the day. Probiotics too! #health
@theBlackFuhrer Understood. Thank you.
@GoddessPosh @theBlackFuhrer You thing they're smart, GP?
@GoddessPosh @theBlackFuhrer it's because they are even dumber than we are. It's unbelievable how stupid the wives are.
@princessxjodie Feel better, PJ.
@DiamondJames Boo hoo. I get up that time every day to commute for over an hour so I can work in a cubicle. Boo hoo. Lol.
@MissVikkiLynn @brattybunny My employer takes tax out from my paycheck so i don't have to pay quarterly. #wageslave
@DominaSnow Is it hard to get an appointment? How far in advance does one need to book?
I worked out this morning. Breakfast was yogurt and banana. Lunch was salad. I was told to lose weight. #gettinghealthy.
@KatieBanksDD GM 2 u 2.  Lol.
@mistressmatisse I would stay away from that thing.
@CandaceMoon I dm'ed you, CM. Its too much to show everyone.
A new day had begun for bolony.  Just watch. She went too far. I can only fall so low.  The time has come for change.
Folks, be careful what you ask for.  You just might get it. This woman is crossing the line with her demands now. Too much even for me!
@brattybunny @silly_old_man I should have remembered your motto, Bunny. Lol.
@hotfattygirl Enjoy dunkin donuts.
@silly_old_man @brattybunny yeah it's nice of her to keep us around. She's wealthy enough and doesn't need us.
@MrDarrellKaBoom @TheKimmieKaBoom @CandaceMoon Wow my question about Candace's and Kimmie's shoes was pretty good!
The excitement in my life is diminishing as this woman pursues her new relationship. I wish them well. My sadness is my fault.
@TheKimmieKaBoom @CandaceMoon How many shoes do you own, Kimmie? How about you, CM?
@brattybunny Ahh Monday. Miserable commute and stuffy cubicle!
@brookeplayhouse @lazonamodels So when are you going live with the new site?
@CandaceMoon Oh? Are you planning more 3am talks?
@CandaceMoon GM CM. I bet you're cooking up some great clips!
@SydneyScreams4u GM to you too!
@theBlackFuhrer it's just the way I roll. I'm an early bird. Lol.
@MsDee_manding Don't mind if I do....lol.
@GoddessSevera Wow a whole magazine for you!
Walmart shopping, helping with laundry, having tea and talking yesterday.
@Mistress_Me11y good Morning.  I haven't been responsive.
No one will believe this, but right now I'm shopping it Ajax.
@Princess_lyne ok I will look, Princess Lyne.
@ArielRebel Bon matin, Ariel.
I had no contact with her yesterday, except text messages before noon. No coincidence I slept well.
@bratty_nikki @NiteFlirt I hope NF fixes that soon, Brat.
@DreamnetRob @DawnMariesDream Yes that's a nice picture of Dawn. Thanks for showing it to us. She's so pretty!
@SexyAsianaStarr Good morning, Asiana. Hope you have a good day.
@JappyPrincess Was it a good movie, Jewish Princess?
@little_mina69 What will you study in college, Little Mina?
@DawnMariesDream I was up early too today.
@CandaceMoon hello hello CM.
It's really nice when medical problems clear up, isn't it?
I had dinner tonight in her house. Then she beat me. Then grocery shopping. Then talked for 15 mins. I bought val card 4 her bf. #humil
@annieshamesyou lol
@Ellie_Idol You're a pretty Princess.
@annieshamesyou Are you a pretty Princess?
@Princess_lyne You're a pretty Princess.
@PrincessLexieXO Who's a pretty Princess?
@Ellie_Idol Who's a pretty Princess?
@WorshipRene yes you are a pretty Princess.
@BratMabel You must be in love.
@MsMariaMoore This tweet should go down in the history books. Don't even know what to say.
@CandaceMoon
@CandaceMoon Hope you feel better soon CM. I'm sad today. My relationship is ending.
I won't give her the chance to reject me. She will not get any more text messages from me. She sent the last one. I can hold out forever.
@GoddessEmma28 I'm still a human being with feelings.
@GoddessEmma28 it's so hurtful. I really thought we were friends.
She has become too greedy. It's all about the money now. Im losing interest in her. She doesn't know yet. She'll be sorry to see me go.
@PrincessLexieXO I feel the same way about caffeine. I love it and I hate it.  Lol.
@Briana_Lee_xx smart move.
@bratty_nikki Gm 2 u 2, Brat.
@Mistress_Me11y does he know what you do?  Does he allow it?
@Mistress_Me11y Your spouse helps you keep track of pigs?
@Mistress_Me11y It's warmer here too. Amazingly it's hard to find women that will let me do this stuff with them.
@little_mina69 it would be great to have you as a boss, Little Mina.  I would work all the time. Lol.
@Mistress_Me11y I also enjoy the adventures she takes me on. Lately her time is limited because she's getting a boyfriend.
@Mistress_Me11y ... Giving money or sometimes she just wants me to listen to her talk which I really like.
@Mistress_Me11y Yes i handed it to her right away. I enjoy helping her any way she allows, whether it's beating me, shopping....
@Mistress_Me11y Do you mean the 200 that she asked for?
She's coming home early from Cali. She said I may need to pick her up from airport. #excited.
@Mistress_Me11y bone-chilling cold here too!
@Mistress_Me11y Well at least you were off. Sorry it had to be for a funeral though.
@molly_mfc @AstroDomina I am jealous. I wish I was having coffee with Astro.
@Mistress_Me11y I left my house for work this morning. The trains were so delayed; I turned right around and went home. I've been in all day
It's so cold here today. I'm craving for this woman to return from Cali. She texted me today!
@MistressNikita @Onmyknees4Her wow you're so pretty!
@LaylaMoorexo @hotfattygirl Wowi what a view!
@lelulovexo Wow you always have the nicest nails.
@Goddess_Lindsey wow that is a nice smile. #prettygirl. #nicesmile
@brattybunny Wow that's a  lot of gear.
@lelulovexo @ItsCleoLive Are you two friends?
@AstroDomina Did you really push him in the water, Astro?
@Mistress_Me11y No snow. Just freezing temps.
@CandaceMoon it was good CM. I'm back in the office now. Ttyl
@CandaceMoon hello hello CM.
@ABC7NY yay!
What a great half-time show! #HalftimeShow
@SexyAsianaStarr Thanks I hope it dries out, Asiana.
I dropped my cell phone in water. Should I put it in rice? #rice
@brattybunny That sure would be funny, Bunny. Lol.
We had a nice breakfast today. She will keep me in her life but will have less time for me now that she has a boyfriend. I can accept that.
@KelleMartina A pretty dress would look nice.
@lelulovexo Are you going to watch the Super Bowl, Lelu?
@Mistress_Me11y The train is petty good here. The driving part is bad by me.
I waited 45 minutes outside her house to give her $200, take her to breakfast, and listen to her talk. Am I in love? This makes no sense.
@silly_old_man @SpoiledAshley_ @brattybunny She has 3 stores?  Do you mean c4s, kb and iwantclips?
I'm way too attached to this woman. She woke something up in me too. I need distance. Her leaving town this week is good for me.
@Mistress_Me11y I have a 20 minute drive and then 2 trains.
@Briana_Lee_xx Have fun snow bunny. lol.
@NoelDash_ @Briana_Lee_xx have fun. Don't fall too hard. Lol.
I don't care about the Super Bowl. Not watching it. NFL defended women beaters. Not cool with that.
@GemmaLynx I feel deeply and hurt easily.
She wants breakfast. Feeding time.
@annieshamesyou Enjoy the show, Princess Annie.
@AstroDomina Where are you, Astro?
She cancelled on me last night. This is good. I need to let her go. She's leaving town for a few days too. She wants $ for trip though.
@bratty_nikki @brattybunny BB and BN - you look great!  Great clips (and I don't mean haircuts either). Lol.
@RileyReidx3 have fun dancing. I just stay in and look at my computer screen all night.
She said I might have to take a beating tonight because she is angry. So I'm waiting. She's not angry at me though...she's just angry.
@WorshipRene That is so funny Princess Rene.
@chantarose I would deliver food to you, Chanta... If I could. I have done that with women...just drop off food for them.
@JessurGoddess @mylindseyleigh I know what you mean, Princess brats
@RileyReidx3 was it a good show?
@Mistress_Me11y I have to leave around 6:45am to get to work at 830am. I commute. Do you commute too?
@little_mina69 Thank you for favoriting my tweets, Little Mina. It means a lot to me. #prettygirl.
@little_mina69 Little Mina!!  You're so pretty. #prettygirl. #exciting
@KatieBanksDD up and at em,
Katie. Lol.
@princessxjodie Have a nice weekend, Princess Jodie. I'm just staying in my room at the computer screen all weekend.
@DantePosh Wow what a look, Dante!!
@Mistress_Me11y I know what you mean. And i have to commute early on Monday for work. Ugh! Do you go to work early on Monday morning too?
@SydneyScreams4u that's a nice size house. It's a sign that you're successful and at such a young age too. #smartgirl. #prettygirl
@SydneyScreams4u How big is your house?
It's brutally cold today in NJ. And now a storm on Sunday night? #brutalcold @AmyFreeze7 #supercatsaturday
Funny thing - I accuse her of changing her mind often. But I find myself convulsing. My attitude about her changed. I'm caught in the grip!
She announced a death in the family and revealed more of herself. I realize my job is to serve her any way I can.
So we are and talked for two hours. She beat me too, but gently. I left and we met later at a meeting.
Good morning. Last night was notable for me. She changed her mind about going out to dinner. had me pick up, deliver, &amp; eat in with her.
@DantePosh Maybe open the window a little, Dante.
@DantePosh @NBCNews Guilt is all over his face.
Had dinner in her house. And she beat me. #boring
@hotfattygirl Very pretty toes, Ivy. #cutetoes. #nicefeet #prettygirl
@Briana_Lee_xx Is that Lola?  She looks worried.  lol
I has a wisdom tooth pulled today, and a post was installed where a molar was a few months ago.
She just contacted me and said "I'm hungry." And she wants me to meet her at a restaurant.  Who knows....I'm still hoping she blows me off.
@LorraineStanick Barbie dolls.
This is turning into an expensive draining boring depressing routine with her. Shop shop shop. Nothing else but sadness from her.
I'm better off being miserable alone than trying to serve her in person. She's just going to dump me as soon as her friends start texting.
I hope she cancels on me. Or at least cancels dinner and just wants to shop. It will make it easier for me to stop wanting her.
@hotfattygirl @LaylaMoorexo i found a woman who let's me sit with her when she gets a pedicure. I bring tea to her. It's great.
@LarsonBlurst Thanks you are too.
And if she cancels me, I'm perfectly ok with that...I have my dependable porn...its just as good.
So now she gets back to me and says we have so much to talk about...when can you be ready, etc.  I tell her I'm ready at 5 to do whatever.
@idelsyluvslatex I meant looking good. Sorry.... Damn spell check. Lol.
@idelsyluvslatex I agree. Looming good.
You know who you are too.
I like it when people tell me I'm their favorite on twitter. It's important to me.
@hotfattygirl I get it on Monday, Ivy. I will show you.
@MistressTdotnet That's so great to hear, Mistress T. I'm glad you're successful. You work hard and deserve success.
@Ellie_Idol I like you too, Princess Ellie. I can't believe you're favoriting me. I don't even know what to say.
@hotfattygirl I lost my phone last week too, Ivy. I'm getting a new iPhone 6! I'm so excited!
@Ellie_Idol Thank you for favoriting my tweet, Princes Ellie. It means a lot to me. #niceprincess
I don't mind if she prefers to be with someone else, but the guys she chooses are such idiots. Just makes no sense.
I'm not even plan B for her. I'm like plan G. She has so many other options. As a last resort, she'll spend time with me and make me shop.
She'll probably just change her mind again. I have little or no hope at this point. If something better comes her way, she cancels.
Today she says she MAY want dinner, food and clothes shopping. Tells me to "budget accordingly." I didn't even respond. That was 4 hrs ago.
@CandaceMoon Is that an old one, CM?
I'm getting a tooth pulled this morning. Hope I get good meds. Lol.
@CandaceMoon I guess you're right. I did have so much fun with her but I suppose it has to end at some point. That point may have arrived.
@CandaceMoon I think she's succeeding. I don't even want to hear from her anymore. It just leads to sadness for me.
@CandaceMoon Yesterday we planned it have dinner. She cancelled. Friday is supposed to be nails day. She cancelled. It hurts.
@CandaceMoon I do miss that. I'm also getting fed up with being constantly disappointed. She keeps canceling on me.
@CandaceMoon I'm ok CM. I'm almost at that point.
@CandaceMoon hello hello CM.
If things don't turn around with this woman soon, I'm going back to porn. Porn doesn't cancel on me or change it's mind excessively.
This woman is cre cre today!
@SexyAsianaStarr it's very cold here but I'm working from home today. Hoping that girl will let me serve her again too.
@CandaceMoon wow that's a lot of clips, CM.
@SexyAsianaStarr Hi Asiana. Hope you're having a good day.
@wifeysworld Wow what's pretty house cleaner.
She's seeing a former bf that she can't shake. I'll be there to help once she's done with him which should be soon.
@JappyPrincess Sounds like shake n bake - from the chicken commercial. Lol.
She cancelled on me.
@MsMariaMoore How beautiful you are, Maria. Good morning.
@SpoiledAshley_ @bratty_nikki I'm getting one wisdom tooth removed tomorrow. What a coincidence, Spoiled Ashley. #snottybrat #spoiledbrat
I plan to meet her tomorrow for dinner. Will she cut me off or will things deepen? Or will she change her mind and cancel? Go!
“@lelulovexo: Everyone should tweet #BellLetsTalk to raise mental heath awareness and $$$!! RT” Lelu says to RT.
@lelulovexo Even I should RT, Lelu?
@DakotaCharms @ConorCoxxx @THEPHILVARONE @zoemfcxxx @VisionMindFilms @MadeUpByNancy He's so lucky. I just get to watch and be jealous.    :(
Don't worry everyone. I'm not getting my hopes up about her. She changes her mind faster than a camelion changes colors.
@lelulovexo we know they're not fake, Lelu. #prettygirl. #hottease. #findomlady.
@brattybunny I didn't know Long Island was called ice island but it sounds like the right name considering how much snow fell. Lol.
She's being sweet now and saying that we'll still spend time together. It pays to be nice! #happy
@MsToxicGoddess Wooo hoo!
@MsMariaMoore trendy with certain women for sure.
I have to move on from this woman. I'll be of no use to her if I'm moody. Whatever time she gives me, I'll take. But I need to do me first.
@bowlmorlanes Thank you very much. I look forward to bowling there again soon.
@CandaceMoon agree. Quite different than most relationships but that's the way I roll. I'm very different.
@CandaceMoon It was a relationship though - not a traditional one. I caught feelings over her and I'm sure she did too. We had great times.
@CandaceMoon I realize I can't offer her what this guy can. After all, I'm married.
@CandaceMoon It hurts. I'm holding on though. I do want her happy but I miss being with her. Maybe this won't last long with the new guy.
@CandaceMoon it's very very cold here too, CM. Brrrrrrrr
@CandaceMoon I'm ok, CM. A little sad today though. My new friend found someone she'd rather be with. She won't have much time for me :(
@CandaceMoon Morning Candace.
I'm getting an iPhone 6 this week. I lost my iPhone a few days ago. I've been using an old one since then and it's not that bad.
She will let me continue helping with her nails and grocery shopping though.
I'm being replaced. I feel sad. She has someone new.
@rachelaziani Do you like making people like me on the east coast burn with jealousy? I'm buried in snow.
@bratty_nikki Good for you bratty Nikki. Hope it's not hard work to unpack so much. #prettyprincess
@bowlmorlanes I will bowl with you more if you oil the approach to the lanes more. Couldn't slide at all last time. Please oil more. Thanks.
@brattychick Wow, is it so hard to just say please?
I'm so happy to be home.
@brattybunny How convenient for you, Bunny. I hope you don't get over 30 inches of snow. #snowbunny
.... and we had a good laugh.... I will end with that and say: More to come! Now to prepare for the big blizzard in the northeast!
So the beatings will end for now. But I will not give up and I will prevail. I said if she gets angry or annoyed .... my back has healed.
Today I was told I could have a "modified" role in her life. Friday nails and Sunday food shopping. Sad part - not allowed in her house.
So now she's focusing on someone else and won't give the time if day. I hate this but nothing I can do about it but be silent. Patience wins
@ArielRebel Aaaaw. How nice.
Nothing happened today. And now there's a blizzard coming. So this is a long break from her. Ahhhh Getting back to normal.
@SpoiledAshley_ I bet you have over 50 pairs of shoes.
@MsMichelleLacy It must have been a good massage.
@SpoiledAshley_ Wow you have a lot of shoes.  How many pairs do you own?
@ArielRebel I like that too, Ariel.
@Kinkbomb @PrincessLexieXO @ShaunaRyanne @MissLondonLix @meggerz @AmaraNoir Is that you in there, Princess Rene? @WorshipRene
@WorshipRene So pretty. #prettygirl  #brattyprincess  #findommyandspoiled
@WorshipRene Meanwhile it's 20 degrees here and we're bracing for a major blizzard. And you just sashay around in flip flips. #brat
@AmyFreeze7 Is the mayor exaggerating? Is it premature to claim that the storm is historic? Maybe he just wants us all safe.
Lots of snow tomorrow, Bunny.  @brattybunny
Today nothing much is happening.  She wanted to hike alone and then see the new person she's interested in. So I get a break today (so far).
Thanks for favoriting my tweets @LaughingLatina !  #sweetgirl
@WorshipRene @LaughingLatina Princess Rene has the right idea. #smartbrat
In any event I'm not pursuing her at all. She probably wants to go to pet co and get a hermit crab. She'll probably call me for that.
On the one hand it feels like a loss and I get sad. On the other hand, losing her will allow me to get back to what I need to focus on.
I'm really ok with the whole damn thing though. It's not sustainable for me. And she does need to be in a relationship.
We talked about it yesterday. She can probably still use me occasionally but she might cut it off it it feels like cheating to her.
She may be starting a relationship with someone. I'm only with her in between relationships. So things will slow down I suspect.
@mylindseyleigh nice food, Lindsey.
She told me she enjoys inflicting pain on me because it relieves her stress. It has nothing to do with me. It's all about her stress.
Today I brought lunch to her house and we talked for two hours.
I'm sorry. I will be more respectful to you, Nikki  @bratty_nikki #dignifiedwoman #successfulwoman
@WorshipRene @GoddessAmiee yes it's a new c4s category. Soiled brats. Lol.
@ArielRebel Bon matin.
@GemmaLynx @AaliyahLove69 it's good that you don't have to work on days when you have pain. I hope you feel better soon.
@SpoiledAshley_ I'm glad you're enjoying room service, you spoiled greedy snotty findommy brat. #brat #greedy #spoiled
@DantePosh It may be at a pizza place I went to last night.  I'm going there when it opens to see if its in lost and found.
@DantePosh Thank U Dante. Just tried it. Device offline. I ordered a new phone. Was eligible 4 upgrade thru my company.
Last night I got her mani pedi Brought her tea and sat with her. Did some shopping too.  Then got beating. Gave her lip gloss and candle too
@brattybunny I'm up too bunny.
@Lynda_Liberty Thats a good idea.
Had a rough night. Got beaten way too hard and lost my iPhone. It's all how you bounce back though. Ordered a new phone and wounds healing.
@SpoiledAshley_ @brattybunny You both look so beautiful and happy. Nice smiles. #prettybrats
@GoddessAmiee I look forward to being a member of your site.
@brattybunny @JessurGoddess There was a big snow and ice storm in the NE. Enjoy the weather, spoiled snotty princess findom brats.
@GoddessAmiee @WorshipRene  I'm with you, Princess Amiee. #smartbrats #soiledsnottyprincesses
@LaughingLatina @bratty_nikki  @MissTierra  How was the iwantclips party, greedy princess brats? #brats #soilednastysnots
@WorshipRene Good choice, Princess Rene!
I took another beating tonight but it hurt so much.  She said I had it leave if I couldn't take it. So I just took more. Didn't like it. :(
@the_danica_dane @shanexxxdiesel I'm sure he does. He likes many different types of girls.
@pf_actual Do you still take current pix?  You were the king on non nude for a while. Any current projects?
@bratty_nikki @MissTierra @iWantClips That sounds like a nice party. Have fun there. #brats
@Princess_Kali @FetishFlea those look like great classes, Princess Kali.
@pf_actual Are those old photos of her, Phil?
@SarahWallaceTV @ABC7NY @5 I wonder what he did.
@QueenKittyOwnsU So do you like to dominate accountants who have to work long hours now?
@CandaceMoon @JDEVILXXX Go bowling.
@trishapaytas Beautiful day for you. You're not sitting in a stuffy cubicle all day with a mean boss watching your every move, are you?
@QueenKittyOwnsU I didn't know you are an accountant, Kitty.
@QueenKittyOwnsU Yes, it's tax time again.
@MistressTdotnet @LexiSindel Who is that guy?
@bratty_nikki @MissTierra @SpoiledAshley_ @UrBratPrincess You are all pretty.
@SexyAsianaStarr Yay for Friday, Asiana! #prettygirl #friendship  #advisor

Hoping to get beaten tonight. Plans are forming. We'll see.  #hardcore
@WorshipRene @brattybunny @bratty_nikki @Princess_lyne @SpoiledAshley_ @PrincessLexieXO Are there any brats or princesses in Las Vegas now?
@MissMurdershoes Hello there. You're so pretty!
@ArielRebel I'm very interested in following your travels when you become a nomad. It sounds so exciting. I just live in one place.
@ArielRebel Bon matin, Ariel. Are you a nomad yet?
@MsMariaMoore Good morning, Maria. Hope you have a great day.
@AstroDomina Will you have a strip steak at the strip club on the strip, Astro?  Lol.

@cherryscottcom Don't say boooo. Say yaaaaay, Cherry!
@AsaAkira Good luck on your keynote speech. I'm sure you will do well.  How exciting!
I might be in love.
@AsaAkira You'll do fine. I wish I could hear what you say.
@KristiMaxx I don't like fat shaming either, Kristi.
@AlexChancexxx You sure are pretty, Alex.
@LaughingLatina @SpoiledAshley_ I never heard of pit bitch. How odd.
@DakotaCharms Enjoy Las Vegas, Dakota.
@VanillaDeVille That must have been very awkward, Vanilla.
@Princess_Kali Great pic Princess Kali.
@annieshamesyou Yes I'm ready!
@cherryscottcom Enjoy reading and cleaning while I sit in a hot stuffy cubicle all day, Cherry.
@MaitresseM Awwww is right!
@Bryci You're welcome, Bryci. Thanks for making great clips that make us burn with jealousy too! Lol.
@MaitresseM Enjoy the convention in Las Vegas while I sit in a hot stuffy cubicle all week.
@lelulovexo @ontherhodes I say have fun too.
@beckylesabre  I'm sitting in a stuffy cubicle and it's freezing and dreary outside, Becky. Thanks for asking!
@bratty_nikki Bon voyage, Brat!
@CandaceMoon yes boss. Lol.
@MandyLovesMoney Well a princes may get tired if she taps her phone too often. May chip nail polish if not careful.
@bratty_nikki How awful.
@MandyLovesMoney Yes that is productive. Just make sure you don't work too hard. #brat  #greedy  #spoiled
@CandaceMoon I know that CM.
Today I went to work. But I don't want to work. Waaaa. Lol.
@ilse_alcorta That is cute. #prettyfeet #prettygirl
@SpoiledAshley_ I hope the effect of excess coffee subsides soon, Ashley. #brat #spoiledbrat #greedysnot #prettygirl #findom
@jdpics @Bryci Enjoy your time in Las Vegas, Bryci and James. I am saving up money to go there one day.

@brattybunny Looks like you're ready for some fun, Bunny.
@bratty_nikki @SpoiledAshley_ Good morning spoiled brats. Have fun in Vegas. #spoiledsnots  #greedybrats  #wealtywomen #nojob
@TheKimmieKaBoom What does the notice say to you, Kimmie?
I had dinner with her last night at a chicken place. She says she can't tell anyone about us, not even her therapist.
@BratMindy @bratty_nikki Very funny, Mindy and spoiled bratty snot Nikki. #brat #spoiledsnot #greedy #selfish
@missivyfrost We just had dinner, but thank you.
Tonight I'm having dinner at a chicken place with her. No other plans at this time. She could change her mind too (she often does).
@bratty_nikki I know what you mean. A brat can only have so much salad. #brat #spoiledsnot  #wealthyandgreedy
@chantarose that's great. I found a woman who is whipping me. I hope she tries bondage soon. How exciting!
@chantarose are you writing a book, Chanta?
@theBlackFuhrer oh how nice!
I may start keeping a log about my adventures. Would anyone be interested in reading it? #adventurelog
@theBlackFuhrer What type of items do you ship?
@redlobster I had red lobster yesterday and had salmon. It was great. The broccoli was fresh. Pleasantly surprised by the food and service.
@jelenajensen @MsMariaMoore @HowardStern @sternshow I guess he doesn't support the porn industry. #loser
@brattybunny Wow that is hardly any regular clothes, Bunny. #brat #greedy #wealthybrat #successful #findom  #prettygirl
@brattybunny @silly_old_man Have fun Bratty Bunny. #brat #spoiledbrat #greedy #wealthybrat
@Roxie_Rae @RealVickyVixxx Have a good trip to Las Vegas, Roxie and Vicky. #prettygirl
@WorshipRene You might like it, Princess Rene. Its interesting to see how the court works. When they call your name, yell "Guilty!"  Lol
@CandaceMoon Doing well CM. Didn't sleep much though. Hope you're ok.
@CandaceMoon good morning CM.
Went to red lobster and got beaten with a belt tonight.  Gn freaks.
@CandaceMoon Happy new year to you CM!
@lelulovexo Well leave some of your hair on. Don't go bald, Lelu. Maybe just a trim?
@ArielRebel Who are you meeting with Ariel?
@MsMariaMoore They're the nicest bug, but still a bug.
@Roxie_Rae good morning to you too, Roxie.
@MissVikkiLynn Maybe I should try that.
@CandaceMoon ok will do CM.
@DominaSnow @KelleMartina A belated and well-earned congratulations to you both! Thank you for making such great clips.
@CandaceMoon It's warm in the corner. It's 90 degrees there.  Hahaha lol.
@CandaceMoon If you're cold, try sitting in the corner CM.
@MsMichelleLacy That must be way out there on the island.
@ArielRebel @Briana_Lee_xx But we'll get to see you in different cities which will be nice for us. It will be fun to see where you go.
@NoelDash_ Good morning, Noel.
@AmyLeen_Moore Good morning to you too.
@CandaceMoon here we go....  Where?
@CandaceMoon @JDEVILXXX Wake up early for work, CM. lol.
@JDEVILXXX oh ok. Because usually she talks to us early in the morning. I guess she's tired today.
@JDEVILXXX is Candace still asleep?
@JDEVILXXX GM I'm up.
@maryjaynexo I didn't know you had your own website. I will look!
@UberFacts Thats a good fact. It helps me realize how small I am. Anything that helps put things in perspective is welcome.
Does anyone know if buymkors and ilovekors are scams - i.e., not real Michael Kors?  #MichaelKors
@bratty_nikki Looks like you have some princess problems. #spoiledbrat  #snot #greedy
@CandaceMoon hello hello CM.
@AmyFreeze7 @ABC7NY The roads are slippery in NJ. Be careful out there! Lol.
I was told to buy 2 belts. One for each of them to beat me. Will update you all later. #nighttoremember
@MistressTdotnet Morning perfect creature. Lol.
@SydneyScreams4u Congratulations on your new house, Sydney.
@SydneyScreams4u Are you getting a new house?
@little_mina69 Great idea, Little Mina.
@SydneyScreams4u It's nice to hear I'm not the only one who gets sleep deprived. Thanks for saying that, Sydney. #nicegirl #prettygirl
@SydneyScreams4u I'm sleep-deprived. So hearing that makes me burn with jealousy. But I'm glad you slept well.
@L1LDebbie I just discovered you, Little Debbie. My name is John Bolony. It's nice to meet you. You are very pretty. Lol #prettygirl
@WorshipRene congratulations on your new car, Princess Rene.
@AlexisBrookeMFC GN pretty lady. #prettygirl
@MsMariaMoore I like that stuff too. I also like steak.
@ABC7NY Why does she look so sad?  You'd thing she'd be enjoying the jewelry.
@JDEVILXXX Don't do that!
@MsMariaMoore What is your favorite type is food, Maria?
@CandaceMoon nice pair of grapefruits you have there. Lol.
@WorshipRene Good point, Princess Rene. Thank you for posting that. #thoughtfulbrat  #spoiledwealthybrat
@bratty_nikki Is it a pretty princes dress?
@hotfattygirl You look so pretty!
@dougdubs @NikkiSims yes very pretty Nikki.
@WorshipRene Wow that is exciting. I hope we can see it in progress.
@Princess_lyne well since you're one of the most popular princess brats it's not surprising there would be a backlog.
@JappyPrincess What a pretty spoiled bratty wealthy princess pose!
@CandaceMoon @JDEVILXXX While you two have a good marriage, many of us have been home-wrecked by CM.
@RicoShades Thank you Mr. Shades for being available and keeping the girls happy for us.
@CandaceMoon You're great at it. You make them poor, miserable, obsessed, lonely and isolated.
@CandaceMoon You're patient.
@CandaceMoon You're certainly doing your part to fatten up men and ruin their marriages.
@CandaceMoon Doing well CM. hoping my adventures continue but who knows. I always say prepare for the worst but hope for the best. #motto
@CandaceMoon Hello hello CM.
@AmyLeen_Moore good morning to you too
@little_mina69 They make me laugh too, Little Mina. #prettygirl #nicegirl
@Giggerty74 @cherryscottcom wow she is pretty. #prettygirl
@MistressTdotnet She's not a pro-Domme, Mistress T. I'm gently introducing ideas to her and she's transforming.  It's amazing! I feel great.
@Piper @nytimes Makes sense because if there's less crime, why lock people up for decades for no reason. They suffer an awful lot in there.
@MistressSasha66 Wish I had just one. I would love it to death.
@dougdubs @RealLilyxo Yes real nice pix.
@MistressTdotnet It's always exciting just to watch you, Mistress T. I think I may have found a real life Domme. Would love to tell all.
I want a cat. I like cats.  #cats
@MistressTdotnet Wow you haven't done findom in a while. How exciting!
@Piper it's bad.
@_PrincessAlli_ @bratty_nikki I also blame others when I lose a charger or a remote control.  Lol.
@CandaceMoon I served her in real life. First time it wasn't a clip.
@CandaceMoon It was an amazing feeling CM. I loved it so much.
@MistressTdotnet I have to read this. I'm found someone who is dominating  me. It's so exciting!
@CandaceMoon doing well CM. I did some dishwashing last night. Did you see?
@MsMariaMoore I like that song too. I sing it often. Funny thing is I don't know the words. Lol.
@lily_cade pretty foot. Thanks for showing it to us. #nicefeet  #prettygirl
@BrookeNBlake Thanks for telling us that. Can't wait for your website to be up so I can watch!
“@SgBz: Internet rains vengeance on car dealership that pranked and humiliated pizza delivery driver - 
@CandaceMoon Hello hello CM.
Cleaning her dishes and putting them away neatly was exciting for me.
She had a sink full of dirty dishes. While I did that, she went out to meet friends. She gave me a key to her apt and I Cleaned. Felt great!
When she was done choosing the items she told me to pay, bring the bags to her house, out the food away and clean her dishes....
Update on my service to the new vanilla Domme: yesterday we had dinner and went food shopping. When she was done choosing the items, ...
@_PrincessAlli_ Will you take pictures and film clips at the princess party? #princess
@hotfattygirl that's like torturing him.  You are so cruel, Ivy.  Lol.
@BratMindy @bratty_nikki very funny mindy.
@MarleyBlazexxx Maybe he's too big for you and you need more time to get ready. He could hurt you if you're not careful.
@theBlackFuhrer I want to puke after I smell it too. But eating it is nice.
@theBlackFuhrer I like bacon.
@RedScorpioPhoto @AstroDomina that's Astro Domina.
@ExquisiteArrion yes you are pretty.
@MistressTdotnet Hump day for someone, but not me. :(
@BaileyXPaige Are you a bratty foot girl?
@ExquisiteArrion :) to you too. Lol.
@ExquisiteArrion nice toes. Thank you!
I was just TOLD to go food shopping tonight. I'm being used....she's finally catching on. I've created a monster.
@bratty_nikki @PrincessLexieXO @brattybunny ok I will shut up forever.
@WorshipMackayla A true princess day for you. Lol.
@LaughingLatina now that makes sense. Lol.
@CandaceMoon yes at home. Every morning.
@PrincessLexieXO You're having princess problems. You should consult with those spoiled brats: @bratty_nikki @brattybunny
@LaughingLatina Did you mean horseback riding?  You said "house back riding."
@CandaceMoon I get my espresso online. On amazon. And I have an espresso machine too.
@CandaceMoon it's very fine, CM.
@jennkho @GuardianUS Well I don't want to eat any insects but if I have to, I suppose I would rather than starve. Lol.
@CandaceMoon My favorite coffee is espresso. It's so fine. Lol.
@CandaceMoon I enjoy coffee too, CM.
@Piper I believe some records should be sealed so people are not held hostage to crimes they paid for a long time ago.
@MsMariaMoore I'm working on cloning. But until that project is completed, I volunteer to be your assistant. Lol.
@annieshamesyou Thank you for making clips. I'm grateful for women like you.
@amberchase :) to you too, Amber.
@bratty_nikki wow you are busy. Such a long list of spoiled snotty princess problems. #wealthygirl #spoiledbrat
@CandaceMoon @SydneyScreams4u that would be nice. I would like to hear from Sydney too.  Thank you both. #nicegirls
@firstwefeast the good old days!
@BrookeNBlake not much excitement for me. Just waiting for your site to go live.
@CandaceMoon @SydneyScreams4u yeah I'm not sold on the idea. For now I'll just stick with old faithful.  The new stuff is for others. I pass
@KristinThorne @ABC7NY she's facing some time.
@Briana_Lee_xx Enjoy your juice.
@CandaceMoon @SydneyScreams4u I kind of like it too but I need to learn more about it first. Is it creepy?
@jennkho @GuardianUS I would not want to eat flies though.
@SydneyScreams4u @CandaceMoon I didn't know you could do that. It sound interesting.
@CandaceMoon I don't know what kik is. I don't trust anything anymore. Social media is scamming us all.
@MeetMadden09 Do you remember what you wrote? Maybe you can rewrite it. I enjoy reading your updates.
@TheMaxRebel @ArielRebel ok it will be.
@TheMaxRebel I would not
@MsEvilyne That is so funny!  I wonder what it must be like to live In a room with that on the wall.
@SydneyScreams4u Come on don't be lazy! Lol.
@CandaceMoon I'm fine. Thanks for asking, CM. I would never do anything as rude as that. I enjoy being polite.
@amberchase Well I suppose that's true. Lol.
@CandaceMoon I will never figure out how this all works, CM. hello hello how r u, CM?
@brattybunny How pretty are you, Bunny!
I just had dinner with my new dominating friend. I get her 3 tubes of lipgloss each week. And now a nice card with $50 gift cert weekly.
@AnnieSprinkle Thats how society attempts to neuter their impact too.
@jasoninja Congrats.
@MaitresseM I like how he's enslaved in a silly tight mask while you flaunt your freedom, MM.
@pornperv87 @CamilleBlackxxx they're that good?  Wow I better check out those feet too!
@ArielRebel @TheMaxRebel While you have more fun and get wealthy, I get miserable and closer to poverty.
@maximummaggie While you get healthier, I get sicker. :(
@AstroDomina I hope it's B. That could last longer.
I found a woman who dominates me gently and let's me take her for mani pedi on Friday. And she lets me shop for her. I love it so much.
@amberchase You're exciting and pretty, Amber.
I don't want to go out because its so cold. But I must go out. I've been in all day. #cold
@lelulovexo You're always smiling, Lelu.
@missdixiecomet Right on, Dixie. I'm an official fan of yours now!
@missdixiecomet I will never set foot in a place that preaches that crap. Thanks for exposing them. I will be on the lookout from now on.
@SnobbyAlexa Don't you have to get up early for work anyway, Snobby Alexa?
@beckylesabre Do you still do live cam, Beck?
@GoddessAmiee I lost a couple but I don't have thousands of followers like you. Hardly anyone follows me.
@AnabellePync Wow you really like soles of silk. I do too, Anabelle. They are all so pretty.
@AaliyahLove69 I get tired of social media too. I can only imagine what u put up with. U are great, Aaliyah. I'm glad women like you exist.
@mylindseyleigh Good luck on your move. Hope it goes smoothly. I'm sure the new place is a palace.
@KelliLynnSage You are great. I'm glad you exist.
@worshipcandace @CandaceMoon Thanks for the recommendation like e. I know Candace has destroyed many solid marriages.
@brattybunny If you mean your nails, why not try rainbow, Bunny?
@CandaceMoon oh no!  Not another butter-boy clip!
@CandaceMoon My wife is turning me into a butter-boy with her constant feedings. I need I be home-wrecked!
@CandaceMoon oh poor thing. Hello hello CM.
@MarcusSolis7 @ABC7NY awwww they have to go to pwison now. Poor things.
@bratty_nikki That one gift is huge! Is it furniture for a spoiled, snotty, wealthy, cute, young brat?
@KelleMartina Is this your last semester, Miss Kelle? Are graduating?
@hotfattygirl that's wonderful, Ivy. Yayyyy!
@MeetMadden09 @NikkiSims They are nice sox. You both look very pretty in fancy sox. I hope you use nice sox more.
@worshipvittoria  you are great.
@hotfattygirl I hope you have a good trip back to wherever you're going, Ivy.

@dawnavrildotcom I thought it was tiff but wasn't sure. Those were the good ole days.
@SydneyScreams4u @CamilleBlackxxx #prettygirls
@dougdubs @kati3kat_CB @MyCamgirl And she's so young!  Congratulations to you kati3kat!
@bratty_nikki You're so busy with luxury. Princes problems for a spoiled snotty wealthy brat!
@xoxolaurenkiley Oh ok. Thank you for telling what that means. Now I understand.  #nicewoman
@xoxolaurenkiley What does it mean, stress shopping?
@CandaceMoon @CamilleBlackxxx @JDEVILXXX @VanyaVixen yes I follow her, Candace.
@mialelanixxx What an amazing backyard you have! Are you a millionaire? Lol.
@SydneyScreams4u ok I will do that.
@SydneyScreams4u I am going to be careful to use proper grammar when I send messages to you, Sydney. I don't want to anger you.
@ReenayeStarr @SydneyScreams4u You look happy in they picture, Sydney.  It's nice to see!
@WorshipRene Welcome back to the US, Princess Rene. I hope you enjoyed your well-earned vacation.
@SydneyScreams4u I know what you mean. I want messages to be clear too.
@GoddessAmiee I think many of us will miss them too.
@GoddessAmiee Must be nice to get rid of them but they sure did look cute on you.
@little_mina69 it's late to workout but you do look pretty in the gym. Your sneakers are nice too.
@CandaceMoon Hello hello CM. how are you?
@RealLilyxo You look amazing. So pretty! #prettygirl
@cherryscottcom I hope you enjoy watching that movie, Cherry.
@Princess_Kali She also once let me do dishes for her. I once helped her try on boots. She threw the boots at me while I was on knees.
@Princess_Kali yes, and I just want to respect her pace and do what pleases her. She lets me take her for mani / pedi. Let me shop 4 her 2.
@Princess_Kali But its something for me to shoot for. I've come so far with her. It's probably boring for you, but it's amazing for me!
@Princess_Kali She's made it clear that this has to be on her terms and that I can't pressure her. She even told me not to bring it up.
@Princess_Kali Thanks Princess Kali. I hope eventually I can do that with her. That's a great idea.
@dawnavrildotcom @pf_actual is that Tiffany teen? Or awesome Amy?
Any suggestions from those more experienced would be appreciated. Thanks.
Things are getting interesting for me lately. My new vanilla domme has need talking about bondage and beatings. Need to play cards carefully
@MistressTdotnet @ShaunaRyanne Truer words have never been spoken.
@dougdubs What are the sites, Doug?
@WorshipRene Enjoy the nice weather, Princess Rene.  And know that it's 20 degrees, windy and stormy here in the northeast.
@DawnMariesDream Thats odd. I got it on my kindle.
@QueenKittyOwnsU I was doing that for two women. It's fun but challenging. Hard to keep up with them. They get angry so easily.
@CandaceMoon Commuting in cold weather, CM. How r u?
@CandaceMoon Hey there CM
@CandaceMoon hello hello Candace.
@JDEVILXXX @angelina_wild It would be nice to work with her. She's so pretty.

Today neither monster has contacted me. First day like that in a while. Insanity is winding down. Get ready porn - here I come.
@Goddess_Lindsey Thank you for making clips for us.

@shanexxxdiesel It's good to see things going in your favor, Mr. Diesel. Thank you for keeping the girls happy for us.
@CandaceMoon You're making me hungry. You don't want me to gain more weight, do you?
@CandaceMoon I like coffee too.
@RileyReidx3 Good morning Riley.
@LelaBeryl @gg_lyn hey there brat.
@BrookeNBlake How nice!  It would be extra special to have teens do that.
@BrookeNBlake I know but I would like to see that stuff on your new site. I hope you do it.
@BrookeNBlake I like cuckold stuff. Can you do that too please?
@LarsonBlurst I'm learning that the hard way my friend. It's been rough but coming to an end soon.
@gg_lyn @LelaBeryl Well I have to follow anyone who nails the brat role. Nice to meet you, Lela. And thank you, Gigi.

@CandaceMoon Thank you, Candace. You have a good day too.
@CandaceMoon I must rush off now. I fear being late!
@CandaceMoon I'm hoping to get in before my boss so I can have coffee.
@CandaceMoon I want to get the early train so I get a seat. I don't know if I have time for coffee.
@CandaceMoon Pretty good, CM.  Rushing off to work early today. You?
@CandaceMoon Good morning, Candace.
@CandaceMoon Probably that too. And in one direction too!
@CandaceMoon Can you imagine that?  Sparks would be flying! Lol.
@CandaceMoon I had a nice long break from work and went to Florida for vacation for a few days. Now back in the cube.
@CandaceMoon How nice of you to ask, CM. I'm well. You?  #sweetgirl  #pretty  #femdom #findom
@LarsonBlurst @JDEVILXXX @CandaceMoon I agree with Larson. CM is super.
I crave White Castle.

Everything seems to end up working out ok. #feelingood
@MissTitiAngel pretty feet. #nicetoes
I'm starting to hate this diner I go to every Sunday morning. Staff is eating and talking near me. I'm done with them. IHop here we come.
@WorshipRene Have fun on your skiing vacation in Vail, Princess Rene. I've never been there &amp; probably never will - too expensive for me :(

@Shane_Rodenbeck Nice way to order burrito. Work for corona too!  Haha.

Last night, I touched insanity.

@SydneyScreams4u Thats great. I like hearing about your success.
@lelulovexo Good luck on your yard sales, Lelu.

@JanetMasonXXX Is that at your house in Florida, Janet? You look so pretty.
@bratty_nikki @KelleMartina In that order too, right Miss Kelle? It's always important to be polite especially to such lovely women.
@KelleMartina @bratty_nikki Yes, Miss Kelle. I agree with you. It's important to be direct and to the point. #pretty  #cuteladies
@KelleMartina @bratty_nikki I agree. It's more polite to say hello, good morning, how are you, and "may I please introduce myself." #polite
“@WhiteCastle: @bolony White Castle likes you.” White Castle like me!!!
I like White Castle.
@WhiteCastle I like White Castle.
@brattybunny How big is your kitchen, Bunny?
@AmaiLiu Haha you can't be that!
@UPSHelp Thanks.  These deliveries have been a nightmare.
@UPSHelp If the driver will not drop it off, how can I find out where to pick up the package?
@UPSHelp If I leave a note by the door, can UPS drop off the package without a signature?  Thanks. #UPS
@WorshipRene You look so pretty in that dress, Princess Rene. #prettydress
@QueenKittyOwnsU Gas is getting so low now. Did you know that we started exporting oil last month for the 1st time in 40 years?
@UPSHelp Thanks very much. I appreciate the timely and clear response.
@lelulovexo Cheers to you too, Lelu.
@maximummaggie Top of the morning to you too, Maggie.
@ArielRebel Bon matin, Ariel.
@DynamiteMizz You get the special treatment for Findoms. Lol
@DynamiteMizz Thanks. They said they would attempt delivery again. Il hoping a note on the door would suffice and they could just drop it.
@brattybunny I like apple picking too. #apples
What does UPS do if they attempt delivery and no one is there to sign? They won't drop off package. Do they send it back to amazon? #ups
@JDEVILXXX @cjoutofthebox Your first blog vid.  Wow thats exciting!  Cant wait to see it!
I'm watching Cops. I like when they arrest people.
“@NYTMetro: Live peep shows are relics of a bygone Times Square:

@SydneyScreams4u Ok looking forward to the new color. Hope it's rainbow - hint hint. Lol.
@QueenKittyOwnsU @Stud4QK Wow that looks like a really good clip!
@OnlyAss @ArielRebel Wow how pretty! #prettygirl
@CandaceMoon yes it reminds me of my cubicle. How did you know?
@CandaceMoon And the food is bad and it gets hot in the summer.
@SydneyScreams4u Barefoot with your painted toes?
@ArielRebel Ok good idea. So now I can get even more annoyed and lonely watching you enjoy your freedom.
@ArielRebel I'm feeling so annoyed and angry now. And there's nothing I can do about it! Lol.
@CandaceMoon And living with the other prisoners must have been bad too.
@ArielRebel How annoying you are, Ariel! Lol.
@CandaceMoon He must have been so angry. But nothing he could do about it. And I hear the conditions are awful.
@CandaceMoon Yes it's so awful to be locked up like that. Don't you feel sorry for him?
“@NYMag: Brooklyn man goes free after serving 29 years for murder he didn't commit 
@ArielRebel I know you know. I just like saying that to you. Lol.
@ArielRebel Bonjour, Ariel. That's French for good morning.
@CandaceMoon Is this the Bolony special, Candace?
@QuickdrawProXXX @SydneyScreams4u Thats what I'm talking about!
@SydneyScreams4u Do rainbow toes. That's a different color for each toe!
@AnEroticGoddess @QueenKittyOwnsU Ok will do, ladies.
@worshipcandace @CandaceMoon I will have to check it out, Little E. Thanks for the alert on the Bolony special.
@QueenKittyOwnsU I suppose it is, Queen Kitty. I suppose it is. I'm enjoying espresso right now. I'm a barista! #barista
I have a date with a doll (I hope). #excitement
Should I have coffee now? Yea or nay? Espresso or regular? #coffee
@CandaceMoon Very funny! You know it will be. Haha.
@CandaceMoon It's been meh for me too, Candace. Maybe we are on the same wave-length. What do you think?
@melindagates @MiaFarrow Yes thanks for fighting Ebola. I'm also against Ebola.
@NikkiSims What a big pool you have, Nikki.
@WorshipRene Hi pretty princess!
@CandaceMoon Hello hello, Candace.
@maximummaggie Have some coffee and you'll wake up. Haha.
@xAngelinaChungx it's ok to like different things and still be friends.
@xAngelinaChungx I don't blame you. I don't understand how anyone would like a beard. I've always been clean-shaven - the way to go!
@brattybunny It's such a nice day out but I have to stay in with my bunny clips.
@WorshipMackayla You're a great home wrecker!
@WorshipMackayla Climb baby climb. Get back to you where you once were!
@gg_lyn I think it's good that you discourage young women from being with thugs. Thank you, Gigi.
@mamapattyw @AmyFreeze7 @mcharlesworth7 I like watching them too.
If I ask someone what their favorite animal is, the least they can do is answer. It's not so hard to say "dog" or "cat."
@AnnieSprinkle I like animals too,Annie. What's your favorite animal? Mine is the leopard.
@rachelaziani Happy Friday to you too, Rachel.
@MistressTdotnet I say Canada, Mistress T.

@MistressSherryE Yes that is pretty.
@MistressSherryE Wow what a nice place.
@MistressSherryE I've noticed that too.  They always seem to be smiling about something.
@noelknight I'm sure he will enjoy that, Noel.
@CandaceMoon I love pizza. My favorite is with sausages. I don't like pepperoni much.
@lelulovexo You look so pretty like that, Lelu.
@CandaceMoon Didn't realize you noticed my tastes. I think of them as sophisticated, not finicky.
@bratty_nikki Looks like a nice clip, Nikki.
@CandaceMoon You realize I'm a proud member if the century + club, don't you?
@CandaceMoon I have to get this one, CM.
@CandaceMoon Doing well, CM.
@CandaceMoon Morning Candace.
@CandaceMoon Darn it! When do we get some new ones?
@CandaceMoon Is this a new clip, Candace?  I'm a clip collector.
@NikkiSims I don't like the dentist either, Nikki. I know how you feel.
@nikki_nova I hope not too.
@SarahDiavola @brattybunny I hate that too.
@AstroDomina Oh no.  I hope you didn't get into a fight.
@AstroDomina What was so crazy about it, Astro?  Did something happen that you'd like to share about with us?
@SexyAsianaStarr @OriginalRigger I'm polite too.
@amberchase Are you opening an account on Piglet, Amber?

@YourSpoiledBrat @bartw13 Who is this guy?
@MandyLovesMoney Princess Mandy!  Thank you.  Now I'm in a good mood.  You are the greatest!
@AnabellePync Good morning, pretty eyes.
@SydneyScreams4u I suppose that's true, but I enjoy seeing you be dominant too.
@ArielRebel Bon matin, Ariel. (French for good morning for all the English-only people out there)
@brattybunny Thank you for answering me, Bunny.
@MsDee_manding Sorry to hear that. Hope it feels better.
@lelulovexo I prefer full (fully clothed is nice too).
@MsDee_manding Oh no. Did you notice that it hurt when you woke up? Or did it hurt last night too?
@anthonyweiner @NYDailyNews Good point! We notice poor judgment in journalism.
@lelulovexo I wish I could see you dance in person, Lelu.
@SydneyScreams4u @MsDee_manding It's about time Sydney Screams is not dominated.
@AstroDomina I feel like a coward compared to you, Astro.
Taking Metamucil is so good for me. I'm glad I'm taking it. I regret stoping a few months ago. #feelingregular

@BadGemma Are you in Scotland?
@brattybunny Good morning, Bunny.
@ballbustme55 @bratty_nikki Bratty Nikki knows if someone is a loser. Most greedy snotty spilled brats seem to know.
@AmyLeen_Moore Good morning to you too, Amy.
@brattybunny How does it feel (for real) to get so much money and gifts for being bratty and not having to go to work? #curiousaboutbunny

I'm fairly disgusted with almost everyone today.
@brattybunny OMG, Bunny. I had steak and asparagus too!
@brattybunny But it's a workday, Bunny. Don't you have to go to work today like I do? #confused
@CandaceMoon You know they don't put real pumpkin in that, right?
@brattybunny You're not fat at all, Bunny.
@bratty_nikki Those are great brat-nails, Nikki. Perfect for a pretty snotty wealthy teasey greedy brat like you!
@AstroDomina Did you frighten him, Astro?
@worshipcandace @CandaceMoon Yes, big time!
@CandaceMoon no

@CandaceMoon @worshipcandace Oh Candace... I didn't know you were listening.
@worshipcandace @CandaceMoon Pretty good. Thanks for asking. Candace hasn't demanded much from me lately.
@CandaceMoon Since you were 10 years old.
@AstroDomina ok, Astro. I'm in my cube.  Happy Monday to you!
@CandaceMoon Happy anniversary. 10 years is a milestone!
@brattybunny Early bird catches the worm, Bunny.
@CandaceMoon What did you do over the weekend, Candace?
@lelulovexo Am I tiny too, Lelu?
@WorshipRene I'm glad your BMW is nice and clean now, Princess Rene. Did you enjoy yoga class?
@DakotaCharms What's your favorite thing?  Brat, cei, joi, findom, sph, b'mail, or home wrecker?
@Piper @thewankybitch Michael Santos writes good book about prison too.
@Piper So I take it that you're in favor of DNA?  I sure am!
@DakotaCharms  Are you bratty, Dakota?
@lelulovexo Yes I think those shorts look very pretty on you, Lelu.
@Piper I heard of a guy in prison for 30 years and he was innocent. DNA let him get released.
@annieshamesyou Its a pleasure to get to know you.  Thank you for filming that series, Princess Annie.
@Piper  Piper, what do you think about all the people who spend years in prison and are then released because of DNA?
@ExquisiteArrion Very pretty sox!

@SarahBlakeInc I think you actually are an actress.
@ShandaFay I remember the show and the car! What a thrill it must have been to see the car in person.
@SarahBlakeInc You sound just like him. You can be an actress.
@bratty_nikki I think I have it, but I will buy it again.
@bratty_nikki That sounds like a great clip, Nikki (and I ain't talking about haircuts either)! Lol.
@hotfattygirl Yay good for you, Ivy.

@SexyAsianaStarr What pretty nails you have.
@SexyAsianaStarr I hope the shower didn't injure you.
@SexyAsianaStarr In four months they will install a post and then a crown to replace the tooth in another 4 months. It's I'm the back.

@lelulovexo Do you enjoy doing cuck clips, Lelu?  How does it make you feel when you do them?
@SandraSilvers How do you feel when you're left tied outdoors like that, Sandra?
@anal_invaders @MsDee_manding @MsWhitneyMorgan @BratPrincess Thats Sarah Diavola! I recognize her!
@SydneyScreams4u I l know she's sweet. I watch all the clips.
@SydneyScreams4u Tell Ginary to stop teasing you so much, Sydney. She has no right to do that!
@LilianaSegura Great journalism. Clear and to the point.
@NikkiSims Thanks for reminding me of your great shows, Nikki. Should I join again?
@hotfattygirl And I heard the performers were dancing like strippers. Gave a bad message to young women, Ivy.
@hotfattygirl  But she stole the show, Ivy. Some people called it the Beyonce Show. Haha.
@AlhanaRotten Love you, RottenStar.  You are the greatest!
@PrincessLozzie_ You sure are pretty. #prettygirl  #cutegirl  #cute  #pretty
What's shakin' in San Fran? Has anyone heard about the quake? #earthquake  #quake

@ShaunaRyanne Is that Bunny's cat?
@dougdubs Im glad she's doing well. It must be nice to work with her.
@nikkiwhiplash How many pairs of shoes do you have, Nikki?
@QueenGeekKeri I hope you feel better, Keri. It's Sunday. You have to work today?
@DantePosh Im doing ok Dante. I'm stressed about work though. It's a nice Sunday and I have to get work done. :(
@SydneyScreams4u I used to be a member. You just reminder me that I should join again.
@dougdubs @Briana_Lee_xx i agree. It looks like a great 'meet and greet.'
@dougdubs How blue eyed Cass?  Will she ever come out of retirement?
@ChanelPreston What a funny way to look at it. #prettygirl  #cutething  #cute #nicetoes  #adorable #pretty
@brattybunny Those boots look pretty on you, Bunny. #pretty #cute
@Mofos @AdultBookingsX She is pretty. #prettygirl
@brattybunny That looks like a good clip, Bunny.
@bratty_nikki @Spend4Barbie @SpoilChanel It's nice to see 3 spoiled snotty brats forming a friendship.
@CandaceMoon I don't believe in that stuff. I believe it's pure nonsense.
@DominaSnow I stand corrected!
@DominaSnow Happy birthday, hot stuff.
@AnaVictoriaXO @AstroDomina Yeah stop that, Astro!
@AstroDomina 2nd row on the left #, but they are all awesome.  #prettygirl
@Bryci Ok thank you, Bryci. I will plead with them. I hope they let me back in.
@LizCho7 @ABC7NY I think it's obviously too young. No debate needed in my mind. I will watch the report.
@bratty_nikki I do enjoy working on monday mornings due to your bratty snotty encouragement, Nicky. #snot #brat
@LizCho7 @ABC7NY if the pope comes to NYC, @heatherorourke7 will be working overtime!
@Ellie_Idol @AstroDomina I should have known - feet had to be included somewhere.  You each have nice toes.
@AstroDomina @Ellie_Idol My guess is that you shot findom, b'mail, cuck, joi, humil stuff. Am I even close?
@gg_lyn Thank you for favoriting me, Gigi. I'm flattered. You're my favorite too now!
@gg_lyn Don't work too hard, Gigi. Are you glad you don't have to sit in a cubicle all day?
@xoGisele Where are you cruising to?
@BratMabel Ok I will be more quiet, Mabel. Sorry I bothered you.
@rachelaziani Enjoy your coffee.
@MistressSherryE Each if those places is nice, Mistress Sherry.
@Bryci I think I got locked out of your site last night for downloading too much. I'm sorry. Can you please let me back in.
@MFM_Productions @AstroDomina Welcome metro foot models, Astro!
@BratMabel Why don't you make more clips, Brat Mabel?
@heatherorourke7 @mcharlesworth7 @AmyFreeze7 I prefer cool weather.
@bratty_nikki Thank you for encouraging hard work, Nikki. Hope you have a relaxing and bratty Monday morning.
@Emma_Ink I like you, Emma. Thank you for making great clips.
@brattybunny Thank you for taking us to your pool, Bunny.
@BratMabel Why do you say so many outrageous things, Brat Mabel?
@BratMabel Who is Ferguson, Mabel?
@BreeOlson yes.
@LarsonBlurst @CandaceMoon Morning!
@LarsonBlurst @AstroDomina I like it a lot too!
@KJDangerDoll Was your opponent left holding the "Z", Kayla?
@WorshipRene You need a vacation from your vacation, Princess Rene. Haha.
@worshipcandace yes I know. I was on vacation. Just got back. Thanks for the reminder, dude.
@ShaunaRyanne Are those Kyaa's feet?
@DommeWorld Well I don't go outside much so I have more time.
@brattybunny Nice photos, Bunny.
A quiet car means no noise. That includes chewing and nail clipping! You'd be upset @brattybunny !
@billritter7 @ABC7NY Those buses are so unsafe; I'm not surprised.
@Ellie_Idol I don't know the dates but I will find out.
@SarahBlakeInc I love our YouTube channel, Sarah. Thank you for posting to it.
@DominaSnow #prettygirl  #sweetgirl  #cutegirl
@CandaceMoon Glad you're feeling good, Candace.
@DominaSnow Is the expansion significant? Do you feel like you're building an empire that enables you to retire?
@mylindseyleigh Did you have a nice time at the beach, Lindsey?
@JappyPrincess Nor is it cute when they scream in restaurants and airplanes. In the animal kingdom, we are the worst!
@AaliyahLove69 @tastytrixie Thats very nice, Aaliyah and Trixie. Thank you both so much - for all you do!
@brattybunny Enjoy your day at the beach while I toil in a cubicle so I can afford more of your clips, Bunny.
@TristynJane wow those topics are so fascinating. Thank you for responding to me too.
@TristynJane that's not too much to ask.
@TristynJane What do you study, Tristyn?
@CandaceMoon Yay for Candace filming!
@lelulovexo You look so pretty today, Lelu.
@DominaSnow Do you own many cars, Domina Snow?
@MsMariaMoore Why are you crying?
@trishapaytas I think you are very pretty.
“@DianaWilliamsNY: #Ebola testing underway on patient with suspicious symptoms/travel history at Mt. Sinai in NYC @ABC7NY” RUH ROH!!!
@BratMabel Sounds like you like the "bad boy" type of guy, Brat Mabel.
@bratty_nikki Thanks for telling us about your bratty plan, Nikki. #prettybrat #snottybrat
@CandaceMoon Well I hope you get a chance to make a sleepless worker clip. I like them so much!
@CandaceMoon Well there haven't been any sleepless worker clips in ages.
@ontherhodes Do you have summer school, Missy?
@JanetMasonXXX It's so hot and humid in DC in August, Janet. I hope you stay cool.
@CandaceMoon I'm not behind; you are.
@luanalani Sorry I don't speak Spanish.
@luanalani Is it in Spanish? When is it due?
@CandaceMoon Good morning, Candace. Did you sleep well last night? Are you well-rested today?
@Goddess_XTC Good morning to you too, Mrs X. I hope you have a nice day.
@mylindseyleigh My heart just skipped a beat! I'm so happy that you would even acknowledge me.
@MissJezebel_ @brattybunny I like cats too.
@mylindseyleigh Thank you for letting us watch your success, Lindsey.
@WorshipRene Thank you so much, Princess Rene - for all you  do!
@ArielRebel Im sorry it's raining near you, Ariel. I hope the weather improves for you today.
@LynnPops I could use a haircut actually.
@theasiangoddess @BratMindy Can you get those eggs in Vegas?
@lelulovexo Thank you for responding to me, Lelu.
@Goddess_XTC @SydneyScreams4u I appreciate the work women like you do. It adds excitement to my life. I buy clips and subscribe when I can.
Hey everyone - what's your favorite animal?
@GemmaLynx Have fun grocery shipping, Gemma.
@Goddess_XTC @SydneyScreams4u Thank you both for all you do.
@lelulovexo Did you have many friends over at your big house, Lelu?
@Goddess_XTC @SydneyScreams4u I would like to watch the fun, but not participate in it.
@GemmaLynx Whats your favorite animal?
@thesexpedition @lelulovexo That dress looks nice on you, Lelu. Very pretty. #prettygirl #nicegirl  #sweetgirl
@hotwiferio Enjoy your time in Atlanta, Rio.
@SgBz Will he have to pay taxes now that he's caught?  Or will they let him off the hook?
@GemmaLynx I like to watch ants. But bees are nice too.
@brattybunny Are you coming home from your camping trip, Bunny?
@AddieJuniper Enjoy your time in Tampa, Addie.
@MsMariaMoore If you have real maple syrup, I would opt for the French toast. Otherwise dance.
@SydneyScreams4u Do you really let people touch them
@TweetKissKara Thats a way to wake up, Kara. Thanks for telling us about the deer near your window.
@WorshipRene Thank you for sharing your vacation with us, Princess Rene. It's amazing!
@WorshipRene Glad you're enjoying your birthday, Princess Rene. It's exciting to watch you!
@WorshipRene You look so pretty and wealthy, Princess Rene. I love it!
@RileyReidx3 Good morning, Riley.
@bratty_nikki He looks so funny, Nikki.
@KristiMaxx When we subscribe, you get an email? Am you like that, Kristi?
@CandaceMoon Pretty good, Cand. Sittin in my cube. You at the pool?
@AaliyahLove69 but it's the start of a dreadful work week in a stuffy cubicle for me.
@CandaceMoon Good morning. Hey who are you calling that?
@chantarose ok I will vote for you, Chanta.
@KristiMaxx You're welcome, Kristi. I am grateful for what you do.
@KristiMaxx @mrlaurynhill I am grateful for any time and attention Kristi gives.
@SydneyScreams4u @meggerz Why can't Meggerz go?
@DominaM Darn it! I though I was the first man to think you were pretty.
@TheRealAndiLand @MeetMadden09 Is that an old picture? It's so pretty. #pretty #sweetgirl
@DominaM They look pretty in you. Has anyone ever said you were pretty? #pretty #sweetgirl
@WorshipLola Hey, who you calling fat?
@PrincessLexieXO I liked Orange is the New Black. Also, the book on Henrietta Lacks was good.
@missdixiecomet I sense you are tired of travel. Is that correct. Dixie?
@WorshipLola Hey old lady.
@MiaFarrow I don't like JZ.
@bratty_nikki well good morning early bird!
@Piper I'm reading your book and I really like it!
I'm changing. Are you?
@AstroDomina You're becoming a leader in your field, Astro!
I hate Mondays. #monday  #ihatemondays
@AstroDomina Yep. Working hard!
I'm reading Orange is the New Black. #goodbook
@MandyLovesMoney Sounds like an enhanced plan!
@AstroDomina I've been at work since 7:30am, Astro!
@lelulovexo Good morning to you and your dog too, Lelu.
@princessxjodie Is it a big house, Princess Jodie?
@SandraSilvers How does it feel to be tortured by another person like that?  If you want them to stop, they won't.
@TheGoddessGreed Yes I am.
@TheGoddessGreed I'm sure you don't, but they might live under the house.
@TheGoddessGreed You named him?
@MandyLovesMoney Sounds like a plan!
@TheGoddessGreed It may not be the same one. They live in communities. You may want to get an exterminator in to fumigate.
I
@MissVikkiLynn I think it's more attractive when women don't expose themselves so much. A pretty dress is fine. Costumes are not necessary.
@MsMariaMoore I have joined and it makes my day less blah.
@MissVikkiLynn I think a light tan line is nice. I don't like over exposure to the sun on anyone though.
@MissVikkiLynn It depends who they are.  I'm not a sun person so tan lines are not that important but they can look pretty.
@CandaceMoon @worshipcandace I read most of the first book. It's a real chick-book. It was ok but not for me.
@CandaceMoon Is it worth watching, Candace?
@KobeATL How do all those flights make you feel?
@WorshipRene Were the caves spooky?  How did you feel while you were in the caves, Princess Rene?
@AmberLily Breakfast for dinner?
@pariskennedy I hope you're not too hung over today, Paris.
@WorshipRene Very nice, Princess Rene! I'm exhausted in my cubicle
@heatherorourke7 Thanks for the great traffic reporting, Heather. #greatreporter  #traffic
@lelulovexo Wow still unpacking, Lelu? You must own so much stuff!
@lelulovexo wow what a big house!
@lelulovexo Is your new house coming along nicely, Lelu? How many bedrooms and bathrooms? Is there a lot of land?
@heatherjs Do you think women had basic rights when men wrote the bible? I doubt it.
@ArielRebel good morning. Enjoy the spa.
@MitzvahCircle What about people who are in prison "doing time?" For them, time is not a gift. It's painful to be locked up.
@MiaFarrow You look pretty
@idelsyluvslatex I never head anyone miss a rain storm. You're so funny!
@KristiMaxx My pleasure. Thank you for all you do!
@KristiMaxx My name is Bolony.
@bratty_nikki You have nice friends, Nikki.
@KristiMaxx I like that you're successful, and I like being polite to you, Kristi. I'm a member of your club too. I'm ok Team Kristi.
@KristiMaxx You have your own company, Kristi?
@VancouverDomina I get jealous and then miserable. Then more jealous with excitement and loneliness.
@lelulovexo I know how important nails are to you, Lelu. I hope this gets resolved soon for you.
@CassCalogera Feel better, Cass.
@Briana_Lee_xx Thats so kind of  you to help him. #nicegirl
@AstroDomina Oh how awful, Astro!
@Briana_Lee_xx What does the letter say, Briana?
@WorshipRene You've gone global, Princess Rene!
@cherrytorn Kitchen gadgets sounds like a nice hobby.  I bet you enjoy cooking.
@cherrytorn Maybe they just like different types? But I hear you...makes no sense sometimes.
@xratedwife Happy birthday!
@xratedwife Enjoy Atlantic City. It's a nice day for it. Maybe you can go on the boardwalk or in the water.
@CandaceMoon Yes a public pool. I don't have my own pool.
@CandaceMoon Enjoy your pool. I tried to go into a pool over the weekend but it was so crowded. So I went home.
@CandaceMoon Yes I'm in a cubicle, Candace. Are you going in your pool today?
@CandaceMoon Good morning. I'm at work.
@jasoninja Nothing much.  Just thought it was cool if they said they were going global.  Good to hear from you, Jason.  Hope all is well.
@jasoninja @bolony
@AstroDomina Have you gone global, Astro?
@brattybunny You're a global brat, right Bunny?
@MistressTdotnet You're a global dominatrix, right Mistress T?
@bratty_nikki Nikki - do you consider yourself a global brat?  That just occurred to me.
I got my haircut but with the girl who had tattoos. Another young lady appeared to cut my hair.
I'm waiting for a haircut. A girl with tatoos is going to cut it!
@AmberLily Whats your favorite YouTube stuff to watch, Amber?
@MistressTdotnet I have a feeling every night is a fun night for you, Mistress T.
I went to a meeting today. Got to talk to Kim who I like.  Melinda wasn't there.
@CandaceMoon have a good lunch, Candace.
@AnabellePync Oh no don't work so hard. Haha.
@AnabellePync Very pretty!
@PrincessElite_x @AnabellePync Wow that's a lot of shoes.
..this whole tea-making ritual. I still remember it. She was pretty back then, but not very attractive now, but that doesn't matter.
Yesterday I connected with a woman who I was friends with 33 years ago. I liked her; she made tea for me which was unusual. She had...
@CandaceMoon No I don't want to be fat.
@KelliLynnSage Have a good trip back to Florida.
@CandaceMoon Im also trying to drink more water. I was worried you might want me fat. Thanks.
This is where I am now. 
@CandaceMoon Yes I am, Candace. Is that ok with you?
My company's cafeteria had "barbecue day" today. They want us to get into the summer spirit but it's not working. #barbecue  #summerfun
Ok everyone - calm the bleep down about the egg McMuffin I had for breakfast - - jeez!  I'm having salad and low fat yogurt for lunch.
@trishauptown @lelulovexo Are you two (Lelu and Trisha) friends with each other?  Lelu, did Trisha teach you how to be a star?
I have no more meetings today. Should I just head home? Yea or nay? #yeaornay #gohome
“@YuriLuv: I'm dying <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> RT @XNicoleAnistonX: Lmfaooo... 
I just ate an egg McMuffin and drank a large orange juice at McDonalds. That's my breakfast. What a breakfast!
@WorshipRene What an exciting trip! It's hard to even follow it because you are always in a different city.
@Zen69X @ArielRebel Yeah I say  Jolie too. That's French for pretty!
@brattybunny Good morning to you too, Bunny.
I really dont like hot and humid weather.
@lelulovexo Thats a nice dog.
@MandyLovesMoney That is so beautiful!
@CandaceMoon Wow you're having one hell of a day!
@MsCoralKorrupt Hope that clears up for you soon. Unfortunately I know what it's like not to feel well.
@CandaceMoon Pretty sox, Candace!
@idelsyluvslatex Can you just wear casual clothes like jeans a tee shirt, Idelsy?
@SexyAsianaStarr Are you planning to get a new car?
@SexyAsianaStarr Is that a big repair? How old is the car?
@lelulovexo wow you're so beautiful, Lelu.
@MrsKellyPierce You're making me hungry!
@SexyAsianaStarr Did you get it fixed?  What was wrong with it?
@Brattyfootgirls I would like to see the "behind the scenes" pics.
@SexyAsianaStarr You drive Mercedes Benz, Asiana?
@MandyLovesMoney Rainbow style is very pretty
I love my wife.
@trishapaytas Good morning to you too, Trisha.  You look very pretty today.
@lelulovexo Good morning to you too, Lelu.
@GemmaLynx Do you like pretty rainbow toes, Gemma?
@GemmaLynx I think rainbow toes are one of the best things in the world - just saying!
@GemmaLynx That is very pretty. Do you ever paint one or two nails a different color from the other nails? Like rainbow style?
@nycjim Will they call it dippin' crumbs? Or maybe crumby dots?
And now I'm waiting to see the eye doctor. Getting two medical things done today.
I just had a blood test.  They drew blood from my arm. Took two small vials.
@lelulovexo You are pretty. Did anyone ever say that to you?
@brattybunny Wow they look so pretty on you, Bunny. Thank you for showing them to us.
@worshipcandace Hey we both like Candace. We should team up for her.
@CandaceMoon @worshipcandace I'm going for the 200 club!
@MeetMadden09 Your dog is in a swimming pool while I suffer in a stuffy cubicle all day.
@TheSamanthaMack Is Starbucks very far for you, Samantha?  Was it much of a wasted trip to go there and turn around?
@MeetMadden09 Good. Enjoy the nice weather. It's stuffy in my cubicle, Madden.
@worshipcandace @CandaceMoon Candace - am I a member of your century club?
@chantarose Those things are not that bad. They're just part of this weird thing called life.
@worshipcandace @CandaceMoon Thank you, Little e. I will get more clips when I get home. I already have over 100 of Candace's clips!
@TheGoddessGreed Thank you.
@TheGoddessGreed It's what was on my mind. Hope you're ok with that.
@TheGoddessGreed I think you are pretty, Goddess Greed. I like how you own horses too.
@CandaceMoon I look forward to that one. Sounds interesting.
@brattybunny I like any words you use....and everything you say, Bunny. I listen to every word you utter.
@brattybunny I agree, Bunny. Men in all white look like fags. #cute #pretty  #toes
@DawnMariesDream I like this one too, Dawn.
@DawnMariesDream I will vote for you when I get home from work.
@DawnMariesDream Wow. Wow!
@ontherhodes Good morning, Missy.
@MsMariaMoore Nice message, Maria. The world is in turmoil for sure.
@chantarose For us it's not the good ole days. It's happening NOW when I watch you. Thank you for all you do.
@TheAshGraham how does that make you feel?
@theBlackFuhrer I had no idea you had your own channel. Thank you very much!
@bratty_nikki Maybe for being too cute, bratty and snotty! Haha.
@AstroDomina Practice makes perfect, Astro.
