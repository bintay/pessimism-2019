@NaimCardinal um golden hills? And one from Calgary? Alberta and I are not familiar with each other!

@NaimCardinal I'm from a suburb of Van. I'm going to my reserve in the interior for my enhanced practicum but I've always been super "urban"

@NaimCardinal yup! It's really intense!
@NaimCardinal mine is 10 weeks in the school and then 3 weeks "enhanced" somewhere else. I have 3 weeks in the school after spring break.
@NaimCardinal practicum is hard work but really rewarding!!
@NaimCardinal Nice! I'm teaching socials in my practicum as well.I'm in a native ed. program so lots of my lessons end up having that focus!
@NaimCardinal Secondary. English major and Spanish minor!
My commitment to twitter has slipped, is this what real life does to you? #practicumproblems
