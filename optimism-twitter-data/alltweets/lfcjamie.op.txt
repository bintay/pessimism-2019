Thanks to everyone who voted for me! 79 votes and I didn't come last!
@staceygoslingx didn't come last! 79 votes ::)
@staceygoslingx thanks. Probably last haha!
Can't help but feel people have voted for coalition 2.0. Well they're in for a shock.
Thank you! Fully expecting to come last haha. Feel so deflated right now Im struggling to motivate myself to attend tomorrow @LauraTravis94
@LauraTravis94 Do you mean council elections? If so the count is tomorrow.

@lfcredynwa voting intentions would change wildly if we have PR.
@lfcredynwa and we might as well all go home.
@lfcredynwa not necessarily and again, the whole point in democracy is that people get what they voted for. If not democracy is a sham
@lfcredynwa if the party/candidate I believe in can't win in a certain place. That's not democracy. That's bollocks.
@lfcredynwa why should your vote be worth more just because you're surrounded by like minded people? Why should I have to vote tactically
@lfcredynwa no they don't... The vast majority of people don't get the people they voted for and have NO representation.
@lfcredynwa do AMS like they have in Scotland. And well that's democracy isn't it? People should get what they vote for.
@lfcredynwa a candidate. Parties are the main vehicle of choice. We need PR.
@lfcredynwa the system is broken. Millions without representation. It's in no way fair. It's not as simple as saying people just vote for
@thoughtgenerate social liberal forum. Left wing grouping in LDs
SLF dividing the party again when we need unity most it seems. Can't say I'm surprised.
@RedAlert1963 nope. It's the SNP and Labour you should be looking at.
@RedAlert1963 deluded.
Civil liberties, environment, europe and welfare at the mercy of the Tories. What have we done?

@tomspray93 I'm not,blaming them but I think they inadvertently created the circumstances for it.
@tomspray93 SNP surge allowed Cameron to squeeze LDs in England and increased likelihood of them holding marginals IMO. English nationalism.
Far from locking them out of Downing Street, the SNP have handed them a majority.
@neilmonnery option 2.
Had enough of this. Joined @electoralreform. We need change now.
Can't cope reading Clegg's resignation email. Emotionally broken.
SNP 26k
Con 34.5k
Lab 40.5k
Lib Dem 295k
Green 1.1m
Ukip 3.8m
This great party disintegrate around us. United we stand.
I know there's going to be a lot of soul searching and stuff but, fellow Lib Dems, we need to stick together. We cannot let this party...

@redmedic56 well we both agree on that.
@redmedic56 but you can't see that but tbf I'm past caring. Revel in the lib dem demise, we are about to be sorely missed.
@redmedic56 things haven't been perfect and we've made some mistakes, bedroom tax being one of them. We've stopped a lot of welfare cuts
@nick_clegg thank you.
Conservatives 239
Labour 198
UKIP 82
Liberal Democrats 51
SNP 31
G…
@redmedic56 the cuts haven't even been that bad yet. We stopped their welfare cuts. Now you'll see.
@redmedic56 if you think we're the same you have no idea and you're about to be proven very wrong.
@redmedic56 keep laughing, it'll distract you from what's about to happen. We've been here before and built back up we'll do it again.
@redmedic56 and we've done so much more but I've had enough atm. You'll see what we avoided now.
@redmedic56 we lifted millions out of tax, the rich pay more than ever before and more poor students are going to university than ever.
@redmedic56 or something like that. We'll be back and you'll see what we got no credit for stopping for the next 5 years. Enjoy that.
@redmedic56 if they can trust labour after AN ILLEGAL WAR then I think we'll be alright. But it's alright coz we broke our promise on fees
@redmedic56 we'll bounce back. We need a strong liberal voice to reject labour and tory authoritarianism.
@redmedic56 we won't be back in government and trust me, you'll wish we were.
Words can't describe how I feel right now.
@julianhuppert I'm so sorry. You didn't deserve to lose. Gutted.
We lost Huppert!? Fuck this I'm done. Biggest loss of the night. Absolute travesty.


Charles :(
@LindaJacquest I'm worried that we may disintegrate.
Lib Dem losses tonight far More complicated than punishment for coalition. 3 way squeeze on votes that we just couldn't hold off.
Authoritarian conservatives, labour and SNP dominating parliament. *shudders*.
@DazaM94 parliament is losing a lot of good MPs
Vince :(
@thoughtgenerate I'm fearing for the party atm
@thoughtgenerate we've lost some fantastic MPs tonight
@thoughtgenerate devastated.
@thoughtgenerate we've had a three way squeeze. SNP has effectively screwed us North and South of border
@thoughtgenerate yep
@maggiewalley I thought it'd be some arrangement between labour/SNP/lib Dems. *sigh*
@maggiewalley I'm devastated. Not just for my own party, but a Tory majority genuinely terrifies me.
@maggiewalley it's not going to be more of the same, it's going to be far far worse with a Tory majority.
Oh ed Davey :(
So so sorry @joswinson
We're a junior party in coalition.
My big thing atm, we are by nature compromisers. We want stable government, the middle ground but it doesn't come across very well when
@mark4ceredigion well done Mark

Things will get a lot worse under a Tory majority.…
Fucking get in!
@DazaM94 we've certainly taken a lot of bullets
@DazaM94  been squeezed from every way possible. I'm devastated. Those who say lib Dems have had no influence are in for rude awakening
@DazaM94 same. It's going to be hell.
@DazaM94 I'm terrified of a tory majority.
@TheWeeYin96 the dream.
@TheWeeYin96 I was getting more and more optimistic, now I feel devastated. I need the conference bar, glee club. Happy lib dem times
@TheWeeYin96 I've broken out the rum, it's the only way.
@witnwis I was increasingly optimistic but the signs aren't good,
Can a lib dem please hug me right now?
@DanNerdCubed nope
@This_Is_Tubbs 60 constituencies matter to us tonight, don't care about the others and not buying that exit poll
@DanKennett it's far too early to tell yet.
@SachinNakrani only 60 constituencies matter to us tonight really.
@DazaM94 I'll eat my hat and then I'll fight paddy ashdownand eat his as well if it's right.
@DazaM94 if that exit poll is correct it'll be a long 5 years.
@DazaM94 genuinely all I care about is around 63 constituencies tonight.
@RedAlert1963 We'll see.
That exit poll can't be right
Right time to do phone day calling!
I JUST WANT THE RESULTS
@lfcredynwa I'm very confused as to how my housemates have done this.
I.am with Red Ed today
Labour to win.....
Keep the Red flag flying high over number ten
@thoughtgenerate I can't revise and I can't campaign, basically useless atm haha
@lfcredynwa moving in the right direction
LD 11% and 1% off UKIP in latest Ashcroft poll. Yayyyyyy.
Wish I could help more in the dying days of the campaign :(

@redmedic56 if you mean we'll try and form a stable government because no one party can do then yes, we will. ;)
@redmedic56 they won't be able to cobble a majority together regardless!

@thoughtgenerate Missing my first Liverpool home league game in 168 to go and campaign for Clegg on Saturday! Sacrifices.
@thoughtgenerate Doing my best but wish I could do more. Wish I was a first year and my exams didn't actually matter!
@thoughtgenerate going to campaign for Clegg in Sheffield on the weekend, should be fun!
@thoughtgenerate I'm trying to campaign and revise, it's tiring. Normality would be nice haha!
@thoughtgenerate I need it to end so I can just concentrate on revision!
@NoName_UseMe well we don't want you back either.
@lfcredynwa manager also matters. Hard to get one of best three players in the world

@warbythered @ged0407 I don't know what a Rodgers side looks like anymore.
@warbythered I agree with that, just don't think Rafa is the same manager now.
@ged0407 @warbythered Mario has been badly managed by Rodgers and used as a scapegoat.
@warbythered Rafa would be looking backwards and sentimental. Not convinced he's what we need right now.
@DazaM94 he's been outstanding at Dortmund despite continuously losing his top players. Good reputation as well which helps.
Klopp. That is all. #lfc
@DazaM94 better manager than Rafa? Behave.

@lfcredynwa an upgrade in pretty much every way.

@lfcredynwa we do but Klopp would be a big upgrade
Would take Klopp in a heartbeat. No chance though.

@leedargue @amazon they once answered my question and when I wasn't satisfied because they lied they just disconnected me! Awful.
@oneexwidow @UKLabour they have a selective memory. After all they don't see to remember their own broken promises on tuition fees.

@thoughtgenerate Yep, they're basically pointless jobs but it's politically unsavory to cut them.
@thoughtgenerate their army has so many tanks they're storing them in warehouses because they're not needed. I want to hit my head hard.
@thoughtgenerate Yep, it makes it basically impossible for me to like them. Not to mention they inevitable pledge to inc defence spending...
@thoughtgenerate Oh totally, Romney basically had to disavow Obamacare, which was similar to what he introduced in his own state.
Or maybe your largeness, is a bit like a TARDIS, Considerably roomier in size!
@thoughtgenerate Not a huge Biden fan. Yes but the problem is any sane Republican has is indoctrinated by their crazy right in the primaries

@GdnPolitics Clegg and Sturgeon
Well can't fault Nick for that. Great performance, #Leaderdebates
GIVE ME THE SNAP POLLS DAMMIT #leadersdebate
@thoughtgenerate both landed punches and we're both uncomfortable at times. Ed still looked awkward at times.

@lizrob92 so we're taking 2 billion to give the richest graduates a cut to their fees? I'm sorry but there are so many better ways to spend
@thoughtgenerate @lizrob92 it leaves university budgets vulnerable to the benevolence of future governments as well.
@lizrob92 cut is basically giving the richest graduates a 9k cut whilst doing nothing to help poorest graduates.
@lizrob92 because those on lower amounts of income will never end up paying the full amount of fees anyway. Richer graduates will, so
@lizrob92 but it only helps the richest graduates. It's a tax cut for graduates who are investment bankers!
@lizrob92 our monthly repayments are lower and we only pay it back when we earn £21000 9% on everything over that I think. Not crippling.
Significant chunk!? Monthly repayments are lower than they were before! #LeadersDebate
People aren't drowning in tuition fee debt Ed, your cut only helps the very wealthiest graduates. #LeadersDebate
Problem with Ed's 0 hours contract plan is it's rubbish, #LeadersDebate
Sturgeon nailed it there #LeadersDebate
Immigration... Well this can only go well. #LeadersDebate
None of the other parties acknowledging mental health. Disappointing. #leadersdebate

Great that Nick Clegg has highlighted the importance of mental health. #leadersdebate
Oh god health tourism outrage incoming! #leadersdebate
Clegg has nailed it there. #leadersdebate
Clegg presenting himself as the status quo. Interesting #leadersdebate
Is Natalie Bennett even still there? #leadersdebate
Nick needs to get into policy a bit more here, rather than rhetoric. Otherwise, a strong start. #leadersdebate

@AllSeeingEye10 Sorry I must've forgotten the part where we won a majority. My bad.

“@RubOutLefties: “@lfcjamie: UKIP party political broadcast. Kill me.” it would be my pleasure!” We have some epic bantz here.
UKIP party political broadcast. Kill me.
@thoughtgenerate would've had separate debates for Wales and Scotland tbh.
@thoughtgenerate thing is it's quite easily to exclude the nationalists on the basis they're not standing everywhere.
@thoughtgenerate I was slightly sympathetic to the Greens but the nationalists... Nope.
Still can't believe the SNP and Plaid are included in tonight's debate.

@MOO #leadersdebate 
One more small section to research and then I've got my first rough draft. The trouble is, I really don't want to do it.
Okay now I've got a last line which basically rejects the entire premise of my dissertation. #GoingWell #Academia
@NoName_UseMe I have to reread the damned thing now!
@lizrob92 You stole my last line!
Basically my dissertation conclusion says "nothing to see here, move along"
@thoughtgenerate just a hunch, but I think his poll ratings may be depressed because of stigma surrounding him. Could be wrong though.
Made up it looks like we're going to hold Cambridge. Huppert one of our best MPs. Also some good news for us in St Ives etc as well.
@thoughtgenerate he's the embodiment of my why politicians are afraid of working together. As much as people say they want it, they don't
Still think Clegg will hold Hallam.
Just clicked crtl+a and then delete on my dissertation. Think I might just back it up...
@thoughtgenerate The Tories are masochists though! Really don't help themselves.
@thoughtgenerate it'll be hard. The conservatives are well... conservative. Labour pay lip service but are quite happy with the way it is.
@thoughtgenerate therefore, I think we're prioritising PR for local elections to get the ball rolling.
@thoughtgenerate oh AV would've gone straight in at National level but I can't see us getting that sort of reform until 2020
@thoughtgenerate step one is getting it introduced at local level I think.
@thoughtgenerate I have faith that people will get used to it and it will eventually become the norm. Tradition isn't a good enough reason!
@thoughtgenerate people in other countries seem to cope!
@thoughtgenerate but imagine a system that was almost proportional! It'd never work...
@thoughtgenerate yeah 4 seat majority with 45% of the vote or something like that
@thoughtgenerate That went well didn't it? haha!
@thoughtgenerate Alternative member system, Scotland uses it so it'd at least put the criticism "it's complicated, no one will understand"
@thoughtgenerate AMS/STV spring to mind. Nah you're forever tainted red now, sorry! haha
@thoughtgenerate haha I always imagine myself in the backrooms rather than on the front lines!
@thoughtgenerate It needs to go. Now. The justification for FPTP no longer even holds. Also, us Lib Dems have a deposit to keep haha!
@thoughtgenerate irrationally! I like to vote based on principle, even if FPTP fucks me over for it.
@thoughtgenerate Eric is a dinosaur tbh and I've heard bad things about both. Oh I'm voting Lib Dem, I'm being a bad economist an acting
@thoughtgenerate Agh fair enough! I can't quite decide who I want to win in Lancaster, don't like either of them!

Regardless of that, United completely outplayed us for 45 minutes and we failed to respond.
How Jones didn't get a red for that tackle. Ref clearly didn't want to be seen to be 'evening it up' or 'listening to the crowd'
Fuming at Gerrard and angry at the ref.
The challengers debate sounds really bizarre. A whole show dedicated to criticising the government?

@thoughtgenerate be geared at giving the richest graduates a tax cut.
@thoughtgenerate that's what I'm hoping will happen, especially with low government borrowing rates. I don't know but it certainly wouldn't
@thoughtgenerate although, I do think some adjustment has to be made to the system depending on how the repayments go.
@THIS_IS_KAT_ I keep my one and only bowl in my room at all times. My plate does get kidnapped sometimes however.
@thoughtgenerate yeah unis don't want it because they'd be reliant on the generosity of government once more for funding
@THIS_IS_KAT_ I've lost a plate, multiple glasses and lots of cutlery. I feel your pain.
@thoughtgenerate Mmm the very rich could end up paying their tuition fees off very quickly meaning they only pay little more than the 27000
@thoughtgenerate oh I agree, just saying there would be some difference!
@thoughtgenerate actually, a tax would mean that richest would pay more as you could never completely pay off fees the way you could now.

I used to care whether or not the tv debates went ahead but after the farcical proposals by broadcasters with their 7, 7, 2 format meh.

Coutinho may have actually learned how to shoot. If he has, we have a serious player. He could be one of the very best. That good. #LFC
Lovren did 'well' defensively but was poor on the ball. #lfc
Sterling disappointed and Lallana frustrated, he gets himself into some good positions but decision making/execution poor. #lfc
What a great win today. Allen was outstanding as was Coutinho.

The real focus tonight should be Ibe and the continuing rehabilitation of Mario. Both impressive.
@Adam_Taylor1 Yep Gerrard fucked up massively as a captain tonight.
@Adam_Taylor1 a true captain does what's best for the team at the end of the day.
@Adam_Taylor1 yeah quite possibly so. The absolute highest Henderson should be is 4th.
Henderson is like our 4th choice penalty taker. LOL

@thoughtgenerate They've both been on the payroll vote for the duration of the coalition.
@thoughtgenerate damned thing! Yeah it was a good win. Glad we've got Ibe back as well, looks a real player.
@thoughtgenerate Cable and Lamb actually have 0 rebellions against the whips! Yeah there does have to be a point when I actually write the
@NoName_UseMe If it makes you feel any better, I still haven't actually written any of it! 
@thoughtgenerate Exactly. I already have data of every rebellion but the way I've recorded it doesn't lend itself well to this instance.

@thoughtgenerate I don't know what the best way forward is. I just hate the false binary between nhs and American system. Absurd.
@thoughtgenerate reminds me of the U.S.congress haha!
@thoughtgenerate there are so many ways such money could be better spent.
@thoughtgenerate no political party is brave enough to try and take nhs problems anyway. Public and parties trapped in extremist positions.
@thoughtgenerate do the people arguing against it realise that they'd have still had to pay money back if we'd have introduced a grad tax
@thoughtgenerate what scares me most is an unrelenting refusal to reexamine position in light of facts.

Oh well polling fun over, back to Wagner and dissertation research.
@thoughtgenerate I'd like to see who these new Green supporters voted for in 2015. Wonder is 2010 LD voters have gone from LD&gt;Lab&gt;Greens
@thoughtgenerate national vote share is even harder to use to predict an outcome this election due to all the cariables you mentioned
@thoughtgenerate The bizarre thing about that Ashcroft poll is the LD +1. Would be more worried if Greens were taking support from us.
@thoughtgenerate Wouldn't surprise me is Cons tried a minority, it failed and then Lab tried to form an arrangement with others tbh.
@thoughtgenerate I doubt they'll be able to sustain 11%. 'Sympathy' vote boosting their numbers atm along with increased publicity.
@thoughtgenerate Wouldn't surprise me to see 2 different governments cobbled together in quick succession after May 2015.
@thoughtgenerate The Cons would be happy to have a second election if it was a disappointing result for them, no one else would.
@thoughtgenerate Exactly, regardless of their vote share they're going to struggle to make a breakthrough. It's going to be chaos.
At least it'd expose our voting system for the farce that it is.
Oh the outcry if the Greens outpolled us and we still ended up with 26+ seats more than them. #ImagineAtmosphere

@redmedic56 problem is Rodgers can't judge defenders and nor can he set up a solid defence. Although I admit we need a new keeper and RCB
@redmedic56 nope the system/lack of coaching perpetuates individual errors. In Moreno/Sakho/Manquillo we have potential for solid back line.
@redmedic56 I don't think it is. Is it the right coaching? Is it good coaching? We make basic defensive errors. It's,more than personnel.
@redmedic56 proper coaching would be a start

@redmedic56 @RedAlert1963 aren't used to coalitions and there has been communication problems.
@redmedic56 @RedAlert1963 our vote share has fallen because we attract left and right voters, junior parties usually get punished, voters
@redmedic56 @RedAlert1963 we're holding up in constituencies that we already hold.
@redmedic56 @RedAlert1963 depends what poll you look at, icm put us in 14 percent last week. Also national vote share doesn't really matter
@redmedic56 @RedAlert1963 we moderated Tory excess and got key manifesto pledges implemented. Could've done more but we had 8 percent of mps
@redmedic56 @RedAlert1963 take us to government for the first time in a 100 years. we'll suffer but junior coalition parties always do

@lfcredynwa that's simply not true. Even in rafa's last season, we only conceded 35.every other season barring his first 30&gt; goals conceded,
We did play well today though, problem is I have no confidence in Rodgers to fix our defence and until it's fixed we'll continue to struggle
Everyone on the radio saying Lallana was quality. Must've watched a different game to me!
Oh and Gerrard was abysmal today. Hollywood balls cost us for the second goal.
Great decision to bring Jones into the team, hasn't been at fault at all.
Sakho played well so I look forward to seeing him dropped when Lovren returns.
Point wasn't good enough today and defensively still all over the place

@thoughtgenerate somewhat harsh, I think he can have a positive impact when his legs are fresh and he's playing further forward.
@thoughtgenerate I agree, to an extent, certainlY shouldn't start every game. Should be used more like Lampard.
Rodgers certainly hasn't helped himself with playing Gerrard at DM and not changing it quickly. Don't know whether to keep the faith. #lfc
The signings Rodgers pushed for represent a colossal waste of money. Worried by the freezing out of Sakho and lack of games for Can etc #lfc
As much as there are problems with the team, can't help but feel they'd be rectified by a striker that suits us. Rodgers or committee fault?
The Rodgers question is baffling me. I'm struggling to see a way back for him if we fail to get results from arsenal and United. #lfc
To deal with the amount of games but we went out of the champions league in the first half last night #lfc
Feels to me like we've almost been trying to make games into second half only contests atm. Don't know whether this is a conscious plan
Just noticed the champions league patches on my shirt. Sob.
@joannadwalker @leoniechaudhry I've never been more proud of you.
Rodgers on a cliff edge. Defeats against United/arsenal could push him off.

@RedAlert1963 We've got more problems than that.
Oh and I think it's harsh on Moreno to blame him for that goal. Was stretching to intercept the pass I thought.
Not even sure if Sturridge is the silver bullet anymore. Whole team looks dysfunctional. Rodgers needs to fix it. The pressure will mount.
@Wilkesy93 Lallana for £14 million okay. Lallana for £24 is bad business. He needs to stop playing Mario upfront alone.
@Wilkesy93 a system which suits us. Atm we're just doing the same thing over and over with no success.
@Wilkesy93 Invent a time machine and stop us spending £45 million on Lallana and Lovren? In all seriousness though, Rodgers needs to find
Sterling dithering on the ball, the ball constantly bouncing off of Allen. We could barely string 3 passes together in their half.
Complete inabilty to bring the ball out of defence, countless pointless long balls up field, particularly to Sterling.
Dunno why Mario is getting stick there. We couldn't even get the ball near their penalty area.
We're in major trouble this season.
If I see one more fucking diagonal long ball to Sterling I swear.

Feel sorry for Sakho, he's been badly mismanaged. He did something stupid out of frustration and now he's apologised.
I just hope that the late goal doesn't knock the lads too much. It felt like a game where we just needed a win to get back on track.

What I'd give for a proper defensive midfielder.
Seriously, Brendan has to do something about the defence. This is quite frankly inexcusable.
Fucking Mignolet.
Bloody hell Villa.
We really need to win today.
@thoughtgenerate you okay?
Bed.
@tomspray93 there was also a lot of realism IMO.
I've just used exactly twice in the same sentence. I need to go to bed.
Were they *cough NHS privatisation *
'Congratulations to project fear'. How exactly was no supposed to campaign exactly? And the yes side were never guilty of scaremongering...
@thoughtgenerate I wint have to listen to Salmond now though!
@thoughtgenerate I'd rather build one around Nigel Farage tbh. At least Salmond is harmless now.
Shame a yes vote resulting In game of thrones style wall being constructed between England and Scotland could've helped boost the economy.
@thoughtgenerate WHY ISNT THERE MORE HOMEOPATHY ON THE NHS. DRUG COMPANIES THATS WHY
@thoughtgenerate someone on twitter said it was. A state conspiracy! LOL
@thoughtgenerate typical bbc bias ;)
C'mon England and Scotland, it's over. Time to hug it out. You too Wales and n.Ireland.
That's not enough.
GLASGOW
@thoughtgenerate rest my eyes and I'll be asleep haha!
@thoughtgenerate my maths has gone actually, it's late and I'm tired! 53/47 so 54.5 and we can both be winners!
I'm feeling the pace now, my body wants sleep.
@thoughtgenerate 56.5% and then we can both be winners!
@maggiewalley aye, it's going to be difficult. Status quo won't do. Still probably less messy than it would've been if it'd been yes!
@maggiewalley heading for a no vote! Further devolution and constitutional change is certainly going to be messy.
@thoughtgenerate maybe he's a reminder to show just how badly democracy can get it wrong!
Send the angry ukip man away please :(. Good job this is after the watershed,
Alex Salmond is currently on a plane to Mongolia to carve out a new life as a goat.
@thoughtgenerate I like him too tbf, the opportunity was too good to miss though.
@thoughtgenerate Andrew Neil has hardly been on tonight tbf ;)
If I was Scottish and just heard that crap spouted by UKIP I'd be cursing the no vote.
Right wing UKIP right there.
Can't wait to hear what Nigel has to say. So interested to hear what someone who will have no influence on discussions has to say.
MING
@thoughtgenerate I'd still expect some sort of improvement. Turn out actually fell!
@thoughtgenerate our constitution could use with a few sharp shocks IMO. But ofc I'm going to say that haha! Then gradual change :p
@thoughtgenerate turn out was hardly better in the 2014 European elections than it was in 2009, despite the ukip hype.
@thoughtgenerate I don't know if it'll ever evolve tbh!
@thoughtgenerate I'd say UKIP's appeal is more to a narrow demographic tbh.
@thoughtgenerate if politics becomes more relevant and accessible more people would get involved no? People get the politicians they deserve
@thoughtgenerate I don't think the scots would get themselves too wound up about it tbh. Think English and Scottish could be a bit tetchy
@thoughtgenerate vicious circle, political involvement isn't helped by our current system. Could a change reinvigorate this? Maybe
@thoughtgenerate theory and practice are of course different though!
@thoughtgenerate I quite like the idea of localism tbh
@thoughtgenerate surely that in itself has the potential to cause massive problems!?
@thoughtgenerate you could well be right. Tory back bench MPs will be foaming at the mouth though!
This is all leading to a constitutional cluster fuck,
'Very solid liberal democrat territory' a phrase not heard often enough! Yay Shetland.
@thoughtgenerate lab/con?
I'm a Lib Dem, I can bring electoral reform into anything :p
It must be great to have a vote that matters, I'd like to have a vote that matters in the general election. That's fanciful though.
Still, it's no Gibraltar.
Oh Orkney &lt;3
@EllieBartonBum I live in hope.
@lizrob92 Can't wait to see what articles you'll write when you're bored next year then for the @DespatchBox  ;)
@lizrob92 I thought we'd ran out of angles on the bedroom tax but apparently not!
@lizrob92 This was the front page of my local newspaper the other week 
It'll feel like a bit of an anti climax tomorrow if everyone wakes up and the message is "business as usual lads" haha!
Silly @lizrob92  what you need to do is some hard hitting journalism like this. 
@EllieBartonBum Every time I walk into a kitchen and you're not there to creep up on, I die a little inside.
@lizrob92 There's a reason he was leading the no campaign! haha
What I'd give for Carragher/Hyypia! @daveycross1973
@EllieBartonBum hahahha. I love those too Ellie &lt;3
@daveycross1973 Couldn't disagree more. He looks awkward on the ball yes, but he's actually got good passing etc. Just needs a run of games
I feel sorry for Sakho. Ridiculous how Skrtel/Lovren get in ahead of him.
@lizrob92 @thoughtgenerate Speaking of betting, the odds are heavily favouring the no side atm.
@lizrob92 @thoughtgenerate Really? What makes you say that?
@thoughtgenerate @lizrob92 I'm still going no win 53 to 47! #YouHeardItHearFirst
Big result for Everton tonight that. They sould take the Europa League very seriously. Squad depth the concern though.
@lizrob92 I think I read somewhere that it'd be a similar relationship to the one in Australia.
I love elections. I'm so excited.
WHY DOESN'T LANCASTER UNIVERSITY'S LOGO LOOK LIKE ATARI'S ANYMORE?!
@Shelter Me and my friend are planning on doing a cake sale to raise money for you! Is there anyone we can contact to get some literature?
@maggiewalley I enjoyed it when I went to see it. The end is harrowing.
@MightyRed_LFC you.
Me and @Rakelthecheese have just come up with some outstanding cake names for our charity cake sale
@lizrob92 vote would be fascinating to watch. Still think no will win 53-47
@lizrob92 I think they should stick with us but to be honest I'm more just intrigued about the whole thing. I think the aftermath of a yes
@lizrob92 Just roll with it!
@Rakelthecheese I thought I'd whisk it.
@PaulHindley2210 Have they thrown a load of tea in sea yet?
@Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210 Just realise that my student finance grants have been cut so I can't afford popcorn. *Glares at Ashley*
@PaulHindley2210 @Wilkesy93 He basically wants to see children go hungry *grabs popcorn*
Just thought I'd let you know @PaulHindley2210 that @Wilkesy93 telling me he wants to cut a load of the welfare state!
Didn't they pay their share the last couple of years? @Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210
@Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210 You think money would flow out of Scotland?
@Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210 A UK where there's less Labour MPs is a happy one for Ashley!
A lot of fighting and protracted negotiations and then who knows. I think it'd be fascinating. @PaulHindley2210 @Wilkesy93
@Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210 #localism
@Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210 How come you want a yes vote? I'd like a no vote but I'm intrigued as to what'd happen with a yes vote.
@Wilkesy93 @PaulHindley2210 You want a yes vote Ashley?
@PaulHindley2210 There should be more power devolved to the regions of England as well!
My prediction for the vote tomorrow. No wins 53 to 47. Heads will rule hearts.
I love John Oliver so much.
Oh I'm starting to run out of patience with Mignolet as well. I've always defended him but he's starting to do my head in with basic errors
Real madrid's attack is a bit frightening. We need to sort out our defence before then!
@Wilkesy93 no I haven't! Is it any good?
@Wilkesy93 have you read the book football manager stole my life?
MARIO FANTASTICO, MARIO MAGNIFICO, OLE OLE, OLE OLE
@lfcredynwa @DCrookster that's a fair point actually, but I think I'd prefer to see Allen if fit away from home.
@lfcredynwa I was impressed with Henderson as always, probably go with Moreno though!
@lfcredynwa maybe combined with the finishing we saw tonight
@lfcredynwa Mmm I don't know, maybe he's lacking a bit if match sharpness ATM, he had a virus last week
Manquillo excellent in winning the penalty. I can't take much more if that! #lfc
We need to get sterling on the ball in central areas, wasted on the wing #lfc
I thought Lovren and Sakho played alright today, but Lovren should not be getting merged twice outside his own box #lfc
@lfcredynwa his work rate was fine, I think you're asking him to be something he's not.
He likes to drop deep and get the ball to feet, he needs players close to him. That goal will do him the world of good. #lfc
I'm also sick of people shouting at Balotelli for 'being lazy' He's not going to make the same runs as Sturridge. He's not that player. #lfc
Rodgers needs to do some thinking about how wee set up in the absence of Sturridge it's not quite working ATM #lfc


God Liverpool's customer service is bad.
Finally watched Doctor Who. Well that was amazing. Probably up there with Blink.
@TalkingAnfield I wanted him too!
My Top 3 #lastfm Artists: The Black Keys (43), Electric Light Orchestra (15) &amp; Vitamin String Quartet (14) #lastfm 
@StanCollymore like arsenal did last season?
QPR are poor.
I need the next Liverpool game, villa has left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
@Rakelthecheese I thought you knew I was joking!
@maggiewalley if I was Scottish and that was the replacement, that would be reason enough for a yes vote!
@maggiewalley all the other flags would laugh at us if that was the replacement :(
@maggiewalley number 6 is quite something!
@THIS_IS_KAT_ rawr :(
Brendan got it wrong today, but I'm not worried. It's going to take some time to bed in the new lads. #lfc
@ArtzeAlex I'm questioning the merit of having our front 3 consist of entirely new signings who've had limited appearances.
@ArtzeAlex @DaveHendrick_AI one player can have a massive influence on how a team performs no?
@ArtzeAlex @DaveHendrick_AI sterling for Lallana. Too many new players thrown in at once. With Sturridge out sterling had to start
@ArtzeAlex @DaveHendrick_AI our front 3 had 1 start and 2 sub appearances between them. Naive selection.
Neither of these sides have impressed me today really. Both sloppy
Same old Arsenal
Loose Women is shocking television.
My life feels like a hollow void without more of the walking dead to play,
Just finished the walking dead game season 2 and wow. So many feels. Did I make the right choice? I don't know.
@LauraTravis94 oh no :( maybe ask sugar if your can move in?
@LauraTravis94 student finance being a pain?
@LauraTravis94 don't, sugar won't be the same if I don't bump into you
THEY'RE TAKING OUR TOASTERS AND KETTLES AHHHHH
High quality, well thought out debate on Alan Titchmarsh show on EU regulation. #SaidNoOneEver
'Royals' are having a second baby. Great can't wait for this totally irrelevant news to clog up my timeline... Again.
I'll return tomorrow with more profound questions.
Why do all main protagonists in digimon have the same hair?
Sadly I think @Rakelthecheese thinks my last tweet is the actual plot of Lord of the Rings
Guy loses his wedding ring. he's a bit of a dick, so an alliance forms to destroy it to get him in trouble with wife #ExplainAFilmPlotBadly
Jar Jar Binks #ExplainAFilmPlotBadly
A walking carpet, rogue, girl w/ funny hair and farmer destroy an evil, walking ATM's space bank and save the galaxy #ExplainAFilmPlotBadly
Doctor who was brilliant again this week!
@Rakelthecheese I have no idea what yousa talking about.
I still think it'll be a no vote though.
Okay... I didn't expect the indy ref to get this close. This could get interesting.
Hate internationals. Hate them, hate them, hate them.
Oh ffs Sturridge injured.

@ThoseScouseLads I think they've become man city?
@LauraTravis94 I think all must've been corrected to parts in that tweet Laura :p
@LauraTravis94 You see it's nice here :D
@LauraTravis94 Did you like Liverpool?!
@THIS_IS_KAT_ you don't understand ;p. you okay? :)
It's depressing knowing that Liverpool aren't playing this weekend. Bloody international breaks.
@maggiewalley ooh the notebook was sad but I watched it like a day after titanic, I was cried out.
@maggiewalley it wasn't titanic though, nothing will ever be titanic, that made me sob so much haha.
@maggiewalley aww! I cry at anything tbh so it was no surprise I did ;(
@maggiewalley you've got a heart of stone if you don't cry at it ;(
I call for a vote of no confidence in myself.
Absolutely mortified. How the hell do I explain my level of incompetence in an email?
You see I read October but typed September in the email request. I'm an incompetent president. It'll be a miracle if the society survives.
So I very nearly arranged for a peer to come to freshers fair for us tomorrow. Only problem was freshers fair is actually a month away.
@MichaelDugherMP isn't it more to do with the fact that 'best' is very subjective and different parties have different opinions?
Can Falcao play centre back?
Great weekend,
@Knox_Harrington if you could put one player in a sitcom who would it be and which sitcom?
@lfcredynwa no I think he was actually going for bimbo!
Someone on a spurs forum referred to Mario as "Bimbotelli". Special.
@redmedic56 can only see us getting stronger as the side gels.
@DukeOfHavoc question mark is whether Lovren can okay RCB well!
That'll do nicely. 6 points from 3 tricky fixtures. Let's build from here! #lfc
@DukeOfHavoc Sakho wasn't great either but improved as the game went on
@DukeOfHavoc full backs didn't concern me tbh, liked the look of both of them. Lovren was very rash and positionally questionable at times.
Finding the commentary love in of Lovren bizarre.
Lovren sold himself again then
OH YOU BEAUTY
Balo looking a bit leggy here, be tempted to bring Markovic on.
Soft one tbf
CMONNN
@lfcredynwa think that would hinder our pressing.
Strurridge seems liberated by the presence on Balotelli
Think Gerrard has been very poor first half.
Centre backs need to communicate there. Could just be a matter of lack of playing time together. #lfc
Lovren recovers well but Jesus Christ.
Gerrard's distribution has been poor thus far.
Mario hasn't got his shooting boots on today but I'm happy with what I've seen.
Good take from Lloris there
Good foul Allen.
Sakho a little rusty I'd say
Lovren there?
GET IN
Moreno will be an important outlet for us today if we are playing the diamond.
Always confused me as to why spurs play duel of the fates before every game but I love it so not complaining!
Ballo be mental lad. Just a good type of mental, not too mental.
Come on red men!
@LauraTravis94 OI, BE NICE
That episode was much better than last week!
I love @AndrewTierney8 and @JoeBuck_94 more than they will ever know. &lt;/3
Farewell @DanielAgger . It's a shame it's ended this way. Thanks for all of the memories, particularly that semi final goal against Chelsea
Yes facebook getting messages is much faster now I have to open up a separate app. So much faster I can't cope with the speed. #idiots.
I'll take that.
@dav13 goes back 5 years iirc
@dav13 teams get points based on how well they do each year in cl/el. Arsenal are regularly in the knockouts so they've accumulated points
@dav13 uefa coefficients
@_rickblaine he's so good in it.
@lmckshaw got more chance of arsenal signing Zigic... Oh wait!
@Liverpool_FOUR Yes. His very presence on the team sheet restricts our options as we need 2 in around him doing his running.
@lfcredynwa oh I've got no doubts about his distribution. Defensively worrying and we always need 2 in there to do his running for him.
Oh and Gerrard is still a concern for me in midfield. Good distribution but Think he restricts our setup due to his lack of legs #lfc
Meanwhile they've just strengthened their squad even further and complimented it. So no I'm not worried, things will get better #LFC
However, after saying all that us and city are at very different stages. We're learning to cope post Suarez with a lot of new players #lfc
Third goal, I have no idea what Mignolet is doing. Seriously cannot afford to lose concentration like that at this level. #LFC
However we know Skrtel isn't a front foot defender. We have a very good lcb in Sakho. Find it baffling why we chose Lovren over RCB. #LFC
Second goal worrying. Lovren and Moreno trying to push out and Skrtel and Johnson asleep. Worrying disparity which will hopefully fade #LFC
We lost our heads after the first goal. Harsh to blame Lovren for it, Moreno clearly at fault but he looked alright apart from that. #lfc
If we are going with a 4-3-3 I'd like to see Coutinho in CM and Markovic out wide. Think it'd help support Sturridge more. #lfc
First 35 minutes we looked pretty good, although we didn't really create anything. Coutinho didn't get involved enough for my liking. #LFC
Okay time for my thoughts on today's game now I've had a walk in the rain to digest it! #LFC
Mignolet all at sea there.
Lovren's position for city second goal appalling
I'm sick of this happening at city.
So excited for tonight. WE ARE LIVERPOOL TRA LA LA LA LA. #lfc
sledgehammer whilst shouting incessantly "THE DOCTOR HAS CHANGED".
Oh and I think that Who episode could've benefited from being a lot more subtle. Felt like it was hitting me over the head with a...
@leoniechaudhry Yeah these sort of episodes are often just setups. Just found it a bit hard to get in to, a bit incoherent! best to come
Pacing was a bit off in that Doctor Who episode. Wasn't the best. Still intrigued to see how Capaldi will develop.
@PaulHindley2210 yeah but I knew that was coming though! This was unexpected!
I WAS NOT PREPARED TO SAY GOODBYE TO MATT SMITH AGAIN :'(
Cabella could've had 2 assists and a goal today. Do it for my fantasy team!
Anita has been poor
#nufc
