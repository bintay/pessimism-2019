I don't talk for the sake of talking, so if i reach out to you i genuinely want to talk to you.
When you lose something, don't think of it as a loss; accept it as the gift that gets you on the path you were meant to travel on.
Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing. -Mother Teresa &lt;33
Happiness is not something that's ready made. It comes from your own actions and decisions.
Be selective in your battles. Sometimes peace is better than being right. <OK HAND SIGN>

Confidence is when you think you're right. Arrogance is when you think you're the only right one.
Change always happens. You don't have to avoid it. You just have to prepare for it. <BLACK HEART SUIT>
The best feeling of happiness is when you're happy because you've made somebody else happy.
Im hungryyy, I want PIZZA <SLICE OF PIZZA><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
"@sagittariusarea: #Sagittarius usually have two main goals: to live the good life &amp; make a difference in the world."

Inactive daysss feeling sleepyy :|
Patience is not the ability to wait. It's how you act while you're waiting.
Don't waste time trying to prove yourself to your enemies.Your enemies will never see the good in you because they only focus on the bad.
It always seems like when you stop looking, that's when you finally find what you are looking for. :l
Don't stress about the things around you, but spend time with God who lives within you.
"@sagggitttarius: #Sagittarius are witty conversationalists. Sometimes it takes people a moment to understand their clever play on words!"

"@Grettahw: #Sagittarius have an interesting insight with anything or anyone around them. They're easily able to read between the lines."
You are part of a puzzle in someone's life. You may never know where you fit. But, someone's life may never be complete without you in it.
God is the only one who can give us what we search for, if only we know how to knock.
Sometimes God teaches you how to solve your problems &amp; Sometimes God teaches you how to face your problems. #goodnight
To change your life, you have to change yourself. To change yourself, you have to change your mindset.
I can laugh cause I've known sadness. Im brave cause I've lived through times when I was afraid &amp; Im wise cause I once did foolish things :)

No matter how far you have gone on the wrong road, you can still turn around.
Two things define you: Your patience when you have nothing, and your attitude when you have everything.
I love this day again :')
There's always some reason to be positive. Don't let a little negativity stop you from seeing all the good that's around.
People come and go. But life is simply about seeing who cares enough to stay.
"@sagittttarius: #Sagittarius likes foreign stuff, like if you speak another language fluently, they will be interested in you."

Smile more than you cry, give more than you take, and love more than you hate &lt;3
everyone should smile. life really isn't that serious. we make it hard. the sun rises. the sun sets. we just tend to complicate the process.
Tough times dont last BUT tough people do.
"@sagittariusarea: #Sagittarius are a little impatient. They know what they want and want it now."
Life never stops or takes breaks, so be what you want to be, not what others want to see.
