Oh just found out that #BBUK is back on.

*goes back onto #meerkat to try to find kittie cam*
@mudbeast76 @theloveclubtv There is something familiar even to my confused addled mind.
@mudbeast76 @theloveclubtv Your wish is my command!
@pinkladyapril Must be great to be in one you have studied!
Looks almost certain to be the Thursday I shall go now,
My review of @theNMTC's A Slice Of Variety Royal &amp; Derngate

@pinkladyapril We did three of Shaffer's plays for Eng Lit. This, Equus and Royal Hunt Of The Sun. So could not miss it!
@pinkladyapril I WILL! I shall come either Tuesday or Thursday. That's actually first play I studied at school that I will see in town. :D
@masutherland Awesome achievement though. Love my walking, so my kind of holiday as well. Better than flopping side of a pool anyway.
@masutherland Still blister free?
The tidied up theatre list ahead of next weeks mammoth week. <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> 
@mudbeast76 In my defense I was doing things while this was running. I was only distracted by the meows.
@The_Ambassador_ We have to wait for everything. Booooooo!!!

How in hell did this happen?
My review of @theNMTC's A Slice Of Variety @RoyalDerngate 
@aelbourne1 You should try sleeping in there.
Not that I have of course...
*tent under the stairs*
Real special production of @AnythingGoesUK_ @RoyalDerngate.
And it has Barry from Eastenders in it. Singing. What's not to like?
Apparently Anything Goes @RoyalDerngate this evening. So shall wear my flowery dress, red lipstick and high heels... 
@theNMTC @MrsChunkstar Thanks very much. Will send email via DM.
I shall have an extra couple of raffle entries at the Sister Act raffle! :D

@mudbeast76 I probably wouldn't really go that far.
@playgoeswrong MY BIRTHDAY TREAT! MY BIRTHDAY TREAT! MY BIRTHDAY TREAT! MY BIRTHDAY TREAT! MY BIRTHDAY TREAT! MY BIRTHDAY TREAT!
Ahem...
@mudbeast76 I am never wrong.* Glad you enjoyed it though, thought that you would.

*may not be true
@MrsChunkstar Shall try and get review done today (although it might drift until tomorrow :O)
Thanks again!
@MrsChunkstar That will be great. Thanks! As much the order as performers, I like a programme just to refresh the memory.
@MrsChunkstar @theNMTC or not... Chap at R&amp;D couldn't find it. You don't happen to have running order and names for show do you for review?
Cigarette in one hand hanging out window. Mobile in other.
What an awesome driver that prat must be.
@SAJ_Toots *whispers* Oops! Apologies!
@SAJ_Toots GOOD MORNING SALLY!
@TheatreTherapy Have a great trip Lisa! :)
@WildeV 
@blabers Enjoy your bowly wowly tourey thingy! ;)
@WildeV Good luck! You can make it.
@WildeV Oh wow! That must be going to feel so good for you!

Electric Light Orchestra - So Serious (Audio) 
@MrsChunkstar Just being on there scared me, I hardly noticed the lights.
Anyway good work all!
@MrsChunkstar Even I have been on that stage longer than 10 seconds. ;)
Superb evening @RoyalDerngate watching @theNMTC's A Slice Of Variety. Easily as good as a professional show. Quality stuff!
@MrsChunkstar @theNMTC Some stupid person attended the theatre with no money, a friendly person agreed to put programme at box office for me
@theNMTC Excellent evening with too many highlights to mention here, but in the review in the week (when I have the programme - long story).
@saintgumsy Quiet you...
Who would be stupid enough to go to the theatre without any money...
@marastepe Just brilliant!
Tonight I am @RoyalDerngate for @theNMTC A Slice Of Variety.
Tickets still available, but few.

Not the time for a reoccurrence of back/hip issue.
#ouch
@MrsChunkstar Thanks very much, I am sure that I will. :D
@MrsChunkstar @theNMTC Yes I shall be there for the evening show!

@Judgys You have fine taste. The best group ever!
@RoyalDerngate DARKNESS DESCENDS!!!

*tosses 50p coin for the meter*
@beadjoux Yep, and now he will have a much bigger head. Quite a piece of work, as I think I have said to a few people. Sad times.

I don't drink coffee.
Those Tories have got a lot to answer for.
@SAJ_Toots Oi @PyramidHead76! I have warned you about putting your hand there before!

There is absolutely nothing wrong with custard creams on toast.
@WildeV Ah yes, of course. Never thought of that. You have the journalist brain! :D I am just full of custard creams.
@WildeV Farage? I suppose a big name. ;)
@velvet_engine All round absolute worst news. :''(
@WildeV Enjoy your well deserved rest when you get there.
The #GE2015 has tipped me over the edge so much, I am now eating custard creams for breakfast.
Only good news of last night: George Galloway
#GE2015 
@Judgys Yesterday @NorthamptonBus! TOMORROW THE WORLD!
Well done to everyone who voted Ukip. I hope you are all truly proud of yourselves.
@DavidPalethorpe Yes excellent work @kevinmckeever on the vote increase. I am truly sad to now be saddled with that man as my MP.
@The_Ambassador_ @ChronandEcho I am utterly sad. It couldn't happen to a more horrible man.
@pinkladyapril I never swear on my Twitter feed, but ducking bucking punts!
@chaterfranks I think due to his sensitive nature of blocking, I reckon he does a bit himself. I did also see him tweeting in meeting once.
@eredarP I am blocked to (of course) but you can still see enough of his page to see MP is already there.
@62drapes Yes, I think the only good thing to come of it is that he is away from the council.
I like how @davidmackintosh has already changed his Twitter handle to include MP. It truly is all about him.
@andrewdavies251 @georgegalloway I would like to see a battle to the death. Can this be arranged @davidmackintosh
@ZanderTrego Speech is only free if the words are coming from his mouth.
I now have as my MP the most obnoxious self centred individual you could imagine and I don't think this tweet will make him unblock me.
@KathrinaPerry The entire county is blue and I am now blue. :(
@KathrinaPerry I am truly sad. :(
*RAGE*
Stop the country! I want to get off!
@BrettMcMaster CHAOS MAN! ABSOLUTE CHAOS!
@SAJ_Toots I sincerely hope the former, if not our society is screwed.
@SAJ_Toots Yes. :(
Another concern of three called so far is how many votes Ukip have got.
@littleknits88 WAHHHH!! :''(
@littleknits88 that poor mole!
Dead badgers, dead foxes and richer rich people. And no doubt many other things to maybe look forward to.
@LGTheatre Remember the marshmallows!
@PyramidHead76 Thank you Mr Crump.
@SAJ_Toots Only an ill wind coming from the ballot boxes.
I have an uneasy feeling...
@brackleyhippy Amazing to see it like that!
@WildeV @nosylocaljourno @ChronandEcho Turn out looked very good at my station today. Good to see.
@helenchick91 It is if you want it to be!
@blabers VOTE GIRAFFE!
I seem to have enough theatre tickets to wallpaper one wall of the house now...
@FlashTheatre15 @Ms_Malaprop Well you would... ;)
@Ms_Malaprop @FlashTheatre15 Hope you manage to get to a good few of them.
@Ms_Malaprop @FlashTheatre15 Are you going to any of them?

My review of (my) day three of National Theatre Connections performances at Royal &amp; Derngate:

Oh by the way #Ivoted

I hope you have as well. If not we can't be friends.
@FlashTheatre15 Altogether now! Count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16! 
@James_Dacre Superb show Mr Dacre. You didn't quite convert me to Shakespeare, but was a truly astonishing atmosphere and experience created
@mudbeast76 @The_Ambassador_ Only one in Midsomer! A valiant showing of three for Silent Witness though.
@The_Ambassador_ @mudbeast76 Although @SimonCoates_ is the true star. He has been in Doctors, The Bill and Holby City!
@The_Ambassador_ Had a similar conversation the other day with @mudbeast76.
Thankfully two who have not been in Doctors have been in others.
#TweetYourView 
@mudbeast76 @FlashTheatre15 ALL OF THEM!
@RoyalDerngate Would love to see the health and safety forms for King John! :)
Disappointed to read in the @RoyalDerngate programme for King John that only 5 of cast have been in Doctors.
Queuing outside for the theatre is good as it is dry.
Half hour earlier.
Well...
I particularly like the way my coat has run water on to my trousers at the perfect point to make it look like I have wet myself.
I now have a huge wad of @FlashTheatre15 tickets!
#ThatAwkwardMoment when you get absolutely soaked on the way to the theatre.
@toosurreal and on that hopeful optimistic note...
;)
@kevinmckeever The X is in the box Sir. Good luck!
The die is cast.

However I fear that much like my horse betting history,  I have not picked the winner. :(
@BrettMcMaster Yes just over town centre.
Plane with "I am voting Ukip today" banner coming from it flying over.

Wonder if I can bring it down with my catapult.
@Tallestpurpl Only just starting so got to get word out. If you want to go next month, worth booking in advance as might sell out that one.
My review of @FOFStorytelling #2 at @NN_Cafe:

@blabers VOTE CAT!
An interesting two events for me to deal with today... 
Do the right thing today.

And that means VOTE!
That's it! Decided! I shall vote tomorrow in #generalelection based on the cute shape of a leaflet.
@blabers @WillyGilder The ambulance one was cute.

@PandaHQSky Hope you put the lid back down again.

@TheatreTherapy Sorry didn't say tata to you. You were surrounded by an impenetrable fan club.
@beadjoux No never! It is a Samsung product.

@garlickclove @FlashTheatre15 The one whose eyes are too close together and which shall do what it is told!
@FlashTheatre15 Ah even better. Had missed that page! Shall use that page to sort the schedule. :D
@FlashTheatre15 @RoyalDerngate OK right, I am back again. This is the only thing worrying me: 
@FlashTheatre15 @RoyalDerngate Great stuff! Thanks!
@FlashTheatre15 @RoyalDerngate OK so these times are not listed on the Flash website? If that's right, I will start to go through the times
@RoyalDerngate @FlashTheatre15 OK thanks. I wondered though as some of the groups have got Sold Out listed for some times on their flyers.
@BrettMcMaster Your problem is you are too honest. ;)
@BrettMcMaster *heads to nearest shredder*
@FlashTheatre15 Shall try to find out at BO later, unless @RoyalDerngate can help in advance?
@FlashTheatre15 Ah yes. What I was after was trying to avoid picking ones sold out in advance. Didn't want to pick a sold and have to change
@FlashTheatre15 As it happens, do you have a list of the show times that are sold out on so that I can try to work the schedule out?
@Tallestpurpl He is my hero. ;)
A Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the @davidmackintosh Party - Northampton South
 

@toosurreal Cynical maybe, but hopefully correct. Wouldn't want nearly 2 million people being swayed by Murdoch's rag.
The future: PM Miliband eats at the table of the President and is offended by the way he eats and immediately declares war upon our country.
@toosurreal I believe we can happily call it a cheap shot on behalf of the gutter press to suit their own purposes.
I can't eat spaghetti without it becoming a true embarrassment.

I also realise therefore I shall never be Prime Minister because of this.
My review of (my) day three of the @NTConnections performances @RoyalDerngate:

@mudbeast76 It's on the Tivo for another time. Sounds interesting.

@PandaHQSky We wouldn't want you any other way. ;)
@PandaHQSky This is what you must always do! :D
@LydiaRoseBlagg Your tweet had a partner on my t/l! 
@PandaHQSky That generally sums up 98% of the feeds I have seen so far. However like all things there is some good stuff.
@PandaHQSky Quite a bit different from that. You use your phone/tablet to stream live. I have seen people cooking, painting etc. Anything.
@PandaHQSky Its a live video streaming app with added live comments.
There is some random stuff on it.
@PandaHQSky This is disappointing. I might cry now.
@PandaHQSky BOO!
;)
@PandaHQSky Works for me...
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 I think we still have our Meerkats mixed up.
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 I think we have our Meerkat's mixed up.
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 It wasn't for me.
Also I think I need to introduce you to Meerkat to accompany these tweets. ;)
@mudbeast76 @HeadcaseTheatre I woke up like this one morning after I had a dream about eating a giant marshmallow.
@PandaHQSky I had a tweet like this from @PyramidHead76 once.
@Saxton812 Any chance of a retweet?
Sad to learn that my bet on the princess name didn't payoff.

I really thought Chelsea Chardonnay Courteney was a cert.
He lived! I spotted his little legs going! <WHITE SMILING FACE>

@Grifster96 All I will say is poor old Jane. ;)

Was a great night though. Amazing sounds.
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster Tastes like fish. Must have been Sunday dinner.
@PyramidHead76 I am waiting for my Canadian painter to come back on.
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster *strokes beard*
*bits of last weeks dinner drops out*
@PyramidHead76 No such issues for me. Yet.
@RDYouthTheatre @RoyalDerngate I think there was enough fuel to drive to Australia arriving when I left.
However enjoy! Well deserved.
@Grifster96 Your hosting skills were also acceptable, despite it being the back of your head mostly. <WINKING FACE>
@RDYouthTheatre @RoyalDerngate I think you have eaten too much pizza though.
@RoyalDerngate @RDYouthTheatre Thanks to all involved with @NTConnections shows this week. Was pleasure to see 10 different shows in 5 days.
@SAJ_Toots Me making sense also makes a change. We are onto a winner here.
@SAJ_Toots That tweet makes no sense. Well, do they ever?
@SAJ_Toots Next time the loo is blocked I shall unblock it with my chin then.
Save dirtying anything else.
@The_Ambassador_ Nothing more than (for some) a celebrated thug. Celebrity, fame and skill sadly comes to some idiots.
Today my theatre trip will consist of the final two @NTConnections that are being performed @RoyalDerngate.
@aelbourne1 @mudbeast76 ... particular and a few parts where they stood at the door area. However like Jim said, not a problem.
@aelbourne1 @mudbeast76 There was a slight issue where I was at the complete opposite side to Jim. I missed one Tania panic moment in...
@The_Ambassador_ Yes as far from a sporting hero as you could find.
@PandaHQSky This is both disappointing and satisfying at the same time.
@PandaHQSky A lovely clear description of the situation. I think this posture is acceptable in this one case for tweeting.
@PandaHQSky If you are not under the covers, this would be acceptable for tweeting. If you absorbed within the covers, this is distracting.
@PandaHQSky You still in bed?
@PandaHQSky There there! ;)
@PandaHQSky Please don't tweet me while you are reclining in your bed.
@PandaHQSky You are missing the required link: 
This #Mayweather is really quite frightful. It is pouring down!
@beadjoux Yes well home. I just had a wander down to see if anyone was there as only five minutes away. Soon as I got there POURS! :O
@toosurreal @Wizross @PyramidHead76 I am keeping out of this.
@Wizross @PyramidHead76 Go ahead then.
SECONDS OUT!
@Wizross @PyramidHead76 I quite like it. However all music/singing is an individual taste, so don't fight.
@Wizross Yes I suspect that there was more than one lot of blokes fighting. Others tend not to be all over my Twitter though.
Earlier on A Small Mind: I was standing in a very wet car park. 
Twitter tells me some blokes had a fight over night.
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek @Lornstar1980 All this tease! *unfollows*
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek @Lornstar1980 Are you sure...?
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Saves me having to do something if I just watch someone else doing it.
But advert feeds would be sad (inevitable).
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots So I am finding it interesting. I was watching a Canadian lady painting this morning at 5:30am.
Because I could.
@PandaHQSky *sticks tongue out at @PyramidHead76*
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 I get them first I hope.
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 One each?
End of a long but excellent day after rising at 5am.

@pinkladyapril I've heard it's rather good.

Yes come and see this, but be prompt with taking your seats! 
Right so thats the car boot done. Next the small matter of four shows @RoyalDerngate to deal with.

But first: FOOD!
@PyramidHead76 I'll keep that in mind. Although didn't see much today, only saw a PS3 and that's boring!
@PyramidHead76 Special picture for you as you enjoyed the other one! 
@Northampparkrun Happy birthday! Sorry I can't be with you today.

@chrispoppe Fingers crossed for little fallout for you. <WHITE SMILING FACE>
Clock set for 5am for some field standing, so I bid thee goodnight!
@chrispoppe Yes, had enough trouble on Twitter. Would never be foolish enough to do it on Facebook. ;)
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots @Orlabobs I predict that tweet is not going to go down well.
Much like a mane stuck in the throat no doubt.
@mudbeast76 @aelbourne1 I now just need to summon the energy for a long day. Hard work this sitting through shows.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots @Orlabobs There is only one unreliable situation here.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Yep!
@mudbeast76 @aelbourne1 It's cooler in there. <WINKING FACE>
@SAJ_Toots *points at @PyramidHead76*
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Can you check goat and pony insurance for me.
@aelbourne1 It's ok, I have had discussions and got a strategic seat, so I shall stop until the end. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 I have just installed it, but sadly my days are hardly exciting enough to share with myself.
@mudbeast76 @aelbourne1 @NTConnections @RoyalDerngate @RDYouthTheatre @BenOckrent and I will be there!!!!!
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Yes I don't want to spoil you all.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots This would work if I didn't have a hideously low data allowance on my contract. I assume this eats data?

@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal You little children and their tipper trucks.
@NN_Cafe Ah yes, I shall be seeing a few (maybe all) of these.
@mudbeast76 shall be at them all with sharpened biros as well.
@chrispoppe @masutherland @RoyalDerngate If you come Thursday afternoon, I might give up my seat to you.
@SAJ_Toots Yes I was thinking he might, but I didn't want to presume.
@SAJ_Toots Well I am sure you can find someone to you liking. ;)
@WillyGilder @votegarvie @BBCNorthampton Ask him how his hayfever is for me would you?
@SAJ_Toots and Keeley Hawes is in it then as well.
Mmmmm...
@WillyGilder Well that doesn't matter Peter Bone for Ukip, er, I mean Conservative is going to win there anyway.
@AlisonBagley1 Thanks so much for sharing...
@SAJ_Toots Good old Harry!
@SAJ_Toots Yes I misread that for a second there...

Go fill seats @RoyalDerngate for the little gems of the @NTConnections shows.
Some great young performers. Run till Sunday.
Ant invasion in the house.
Glorious...
@ArteNicholas @Woah_say_what If you are free Sunday evening at 6:45, I recommend the Connections play Drama, Baby to you.
@mudbeast76 Best one I have seen of the five so far, you are in for a treat.
I may have booked a ticket to see it again...
@WildeV Looks good! I'll be there. :)
@The_Ambassador_ I was there an hour ago!
@votegarvie Start of June is usually grass, so odd you are suffering now.
Just accidentally booked another @NTConnections @RoyalDerngate. So that will be ten I shall see now then...
one person followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@NN_Cafe @FOFStorytelling Got it! Thanks.
@NN_Cafe @FOFStorytelling Ok great stuff. Seeing a play at R&amp;D, so shall pop in in about an hour if you are open then?
@NN_Cafe Are you selling @FOFStorytelling tickets at the cafe?
@mudbeast76 Are you seeing Drama, Baby on Sunday? 6:45pm.
@chrispoppe Yes got to be a little different. Although unless it is very sunny, not too much light gets into there.
@chrispoppe It will be the matinee, which I fear may dilute the atmosphere a touch. Hopefully not too much though.
@62drapes Was the general and I have made it with ease!
@votegarvie Hayfever is grim. I shall have that soon when the grass arrives. Hope it has eased now.
14 people in front of me at post office.
30 minutes to get to theatre.
A simple stroll in the park.
@BBCNorthampton @blabers I like the paper dispensers @RoyalDerngate
#randomthoughtthursday
Day two of @NTConnections @RoyalDerngate, and I have a double bill of shows to see.
@BBCNorthampton @blabers The best public loo is now underneath the worse bus interchange.
@KazShakespeare The best thing in MK is the frog clock.
Endorsement or not, I can't help but feel the @ChronandEcho has sold its soul for a quick buck a week before election 
@Npton_Adviser @KazShakespeare Northampton for me as well, but I am very biased. I find MK shallow and soulless.
@KazShakespeare Yes I would imagine that it should be more fashionable for a youngster.
@SAJ_Toots Sorry, I am a failure.
@KazShakespeare I think Milton Keynes and Northampton are very different towns and neither should try to be the other. Room for both types.
FRANK MAN, YOU’RE ALIVE!
IT'S JUST… I SAW THIS HANDBAG MAN
IT LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU.
OH FRANK! I’M SO RELIEVED! ht…
@SAJ_Toots Sorry I forgot to prepare the drinks again.
@BBCNorthampton Is that @davidmackintosh sneaked in and coughing in the background? I heard he was "ill".
Like A Virgin comes on @Absolute80s and all I can hear is Jim Broadbent.
@mudbeast76 Good night Mr Jim!
Not sure a plasticine character has got to do with it though...
@Woah_say_what A fast realisation there...
@Woah_say_what That Tony is a bad influence. ;)
@Woah_say_what @davidmackintosh Yes you little political rebel you! :)
@Woah_say_what @davidmackintosh I wondered about you tweeting from that account. ;)
That will be blocked now as well. :D
@TBoOTheatre @davidmackintosh I think it was one of my blog posts that did it. Although I am one of many. We outnumber the unblocked. ;)
@masutherland @chrispoppe Do you think he liked it?

@Furryous1 I miss them, they were always the better shop over HMV for me.
I want them and Woolworths back.
NOW!
Advantage of frequenting car boot sales is you get moments of unremitting nostalgia happening. 
@BloxhamSchool @NTConnections They were excellent. The other six plays I am going to see have got a hard act to follow.
Thanks also for RT!
@chrispoppe Yes spotted that. Nothing gets passed me. ;)
I will enjoy this particular Shakespeare, I have no doubt.
@chrispoppe Shakespeare always blows my mind, hopefully this time in a good way! :D
I shall see it on election day no less!
My review of day one of the @NTConnections 2015 performances @RoyalDerngate:

@chrispoppe Well that was good then... :D
@masutherland I am sure this time I will. Seems to be all about atmosphere this one.
Election day will be the rather glorious day I see it.
@masutherland It's gone down really very well hasn't it! Congrats to all, I shall do my utmost to be totally dazzled myself this time. :D
@PandaHQSky It's politics Grace, the gentleman can't take banter or jibes. Well anyone who disagrees with him really.
@MichaelBott Well of course... ;) I shall call you Mr Sutherland in future.
Blocked on Twitter by @davidmackintosh, but still getting personally addressed mail. How sweet! 
@MichaelBott JUST STOP REMAKING CLASSIC FILMS! JUST STOP! LIKE NOW! OK!
Catch if you can! 
Welcome to a doze off to @Absolute80s evening.

*does final Twitter check on his filofax*
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre I expected nothing less. This will all be a masterpiece of performance and timing from us all.
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre All I ask in return, is that you start as on time as possible. ;)
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre Time permitting, I shall be reviewing all 9 I see. Your one will of course get a reappraisal without doubt.
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre I can confirm that although I haven't yet purchased my ticket, I will bd watching both shows Saturday. #run
@Orlabobs @PyramidHead76 *lingers in corner with an awkward face*
@RoyalDerngate Is there anywhere I can get the casts for Edelweiss/Crazy Sexy shows today? @RDYouthTheatre
@ellite_theatre I got my ticket!
@masutherland @callum_jones22 Have a great night!
@SAJ_Toots Yes been a lot of miss reporting this story to weaken it. This complaint was never about wolf whistling.

#Orville #RIP #keithharris 
@RoyalDerngate @NTConnections Two down for me with at least seven more to come. :)
About to watch the first @NTConnections of the week @RoyalDerngate
Complete with script! 
@PyramidHead76 Yes, it's just generally a load of Balls...
Orville will never wish he could fly again. :'(

RIP Keith Harris
@Kitty1601 @Tallestpurpl @Michael_Ellis1 @davidmackintosh The most tender skin in politics.
@mischiefcomedy I already have my June birthday treat to myself for this. Really looking forward to it!
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre Its a tight fit. I suspect if the wind was fair it could almost be done, but... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre Bother! If that had been the right time, I could have done both shows.
@aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre Remind me how long Hacktivists was again.
@chrispoppe Thank you Mr Eurovision! ;)
Start of what was one of my favourite theatre weeks last year: The @NTConnections shows @RoyalDerngate 
Seeing three today. Great stuff!
@PandaHQSky I remember seeing Big Daddy a bit on TV in the eighties, but not a lot. It just happened to be on now and again.
@PandaHQSky Ah that explains the real film feel of it all.
It was great stuff, even for a non wrestling fan.
Sorry about that! ;)
@PandaHQSky Yep thats the one.
Enjoyed it, powerful stuff.
@PandaHQSky Phew! Dangerous place this wrestling.
I watched the film The Wrestler the other week. Looked dangerous, even for crowd
@Kitty1601 @votegarvie @Craig_Lewis77 @kevinmckeever @davidmackintosh Everyone loves him! In Mackintosh world anyway. Safe seat. LOL! ;)
@PandaHQSky NOT THE FACE! NoooooooooooOOO!
@Kitty1601 @votegarvie @Craig_Lewis77 @kevinmckeever @davidmackintosh I am worried about how over confident he is about winning.
@PandaHQSky Ah yes. I saw the excitable wrestling tweets.
So you were nearly more injured than the competitors. Nasty!
@PandaHQSky I am bothered now. Has the coal man been again?
@tonyclarkeuk @itvanglia Yes, not as if there were several other candidates. They had just a single other one to feature. Disappointing.
@tonyclarkeuk Let down by @itvanglia tonight I feel.
@PandaHQSky Not bothered now...
;)
@pinkladyapril On a par with unblocking the loo one I posted the other week. :)
@PyramidHead76 I knew Android had been out selling them for a while, but not that much. Crazy not to fully support at app launch now.
@PandaHQSky Never mind me, I never ask you whether you are well! :)
@PandaHQSky Hello ma'am!
@PyramidHead76 I see "watch on periscope" tweets and fume. Time for them to grow up regarding android apps!
@PyramidHead76 Be nice to be able to use either of them.
@pinkladyapril Quality tweet! ;)
@WildeV 
@WildeV or this if not? 
@PyramidHead76 One of the best of the old bitty tunes for me.
@BBCNorthampton @Stuart_Linnell If @Michael_Ellis1 gets back in again, he is going to have to stop blaming the previous administration.
@BBCNorthampton @Stuart_Linnell Zero hour contracts. Low wages for staff. I wonder why businesses love the Conservatives...
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal Karma even in GTA. There is hope in the world.
@PyramidHead76 @Woodywizz @toosurreal I just liked the music I think.
@PyramidHead76 @Woodywizz @toosurreal I regret never finishing Monty on the Run even to this day.
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 Almost the same. I will finish no doubt, but we are probably talking months.
@HeadcaseTheatre @mudbeast76 A bald patch.
@mudbeast76 @HeadcaseTheatre Under the hat is a perfectly formed play! ;)
@BrettMcMaster Second part is the best and most interesting, so you enjoy.
@BrettMcMaster Yes was excellent stuff with typical quality performances from Simm and Threlfall.
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 Standing in a field... 

4 people followed me and one person unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@EnidButterworth Could they tell you what's gripping about FIFA to play?
I am absolutely knackered. I feel as if I have done the marathon.
@EnidButterworth ... scenes from the game than a reader of a crime novel to carry out a cold calculated murder they have read about.
@EnidButterworth Not defensive at all, just generally fed up with a game being blamed for ills of society. I am no more likely to reenact...
@PyramidHead76 Just weird, ignoring even the morality angle. Just why would they want to, and how are they qualified?
Smells fishy to me.
@PyramidHead76 That's, erm, interesting...
@kardisom Not the best one at Overstone. Weather grim and getting worse now. :(
Good luck selling/not buying.
@kardisom Are you doing a car boot?
@PyramidHead76 I haven't played that for three days!

Shall later though...
Standing in a field... 
It's oh so quiet...
@EnidButterworth @PyramidHead76 An 8 year old illegally playing it makes it wrong for the game to exist?
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 Freak...
@aelbourne1 @mudbeast76 @RDYouthTheatre @RoyalDerngate Cloning required! Although I think one of me is quite enough.
@mudbeast76 @aelbourne1 @RDYouthTheatre I'm already regretting potential of not seeing again in the new layout. Damn R&amp;D &amp; all its delights!
@aelbourne1 I may regrettably not be there, as I might be next door in the Derngate. @mudbeast76 @RDYouthTheatre
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 You run an gun with mouse/keyboard and drive with controller. Are you mad man?
@mudbeast76 No worries. Didn't realise there were three of them on Sunday at first, just a good guess.
Not seeing any Sunday myself. Yet.
@mudbeast76 @RoyalDerngate Extra cushion for a second viewing?
@mudbeast76 Well you are five minutes late to watch it again. :)
@mudbeast76 For me I would have been happy to see it again, except maybe the first half hour which was the only clunky part for me.
@mudbeast76 Glad you enjoyed it.
Its been much and unfairly maligned in places.
@mudbeast76 Shame. <DISAPPOINTED FACE> I liked it. Hope you have.
@mudbeast76 Enjoy Cyrano Mr and Mrs Jim (and mother-in-law)!
@Ms_Malaprop Gorgeous...
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal There had to be advantage of Microsoft Windows somewhere...
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal SNAP!
Cannot comprehend how I used to drive with keyboard.
@toosurreal I have the cumbersome method of walking/shooting with keyboard/mouse and driving/flying with Xbox controller.
@toosurreal The open world games for me are more about just walking and driving than the main game. Why I had 200 hours time on my FO3 save!
@toosurreal Nothing wrong with that. Not like they come out every week. Just enjoy!
So it's either Ed Miliband in bed with Nicola Sturgeon, or David Cameron in bed with Nigel Farage.
Either way, I am feeling quite sick now.
@Craig_Lewis77 @kevinmckeever @davidmackintosh He might do now you are in this convo! Although blocking media/journo is dodgy.
@toosurreal Next time this will happen!
@kevinmckeever @Craig_Lewis77 We have all been blocked by @davidmackintosh...
@WildeV Thought so. ;)
@toosurreal Out of control man! I even smashed a couple of them before eating them!
@toosurreal Tennis, golf, wildlife photography and yoga. There is nothing better.
#DoingItWrong
Living the rock and roll life of eating too many custard creams on a Friday night.
@WildeV Yes that looks a lot more sinister from the usual ones I have seen you reading.
Try not to scream on the train. ;)
@Ms_Malaprop I have my suspicions of which you refer to there... :)
@Judgys Sounds good! Although my ventures to London usually involve seeing a famous person, and I am a fan of Nicole. So hope to get there.
@Judgys I just might try to see that myself, if tickets are still available later in the year that is.
@pinkladyapril There is distinct lack of the volunteer department to do this now, as I suspect you are probably aware in your hobby I guess?
@pinkladyapril Old man's marbles as its unfairly known, bowls. I am third generation family player and run two and a half teams!
@pinkladyapril Your guess is as good as mine! I shall have the small matter of up to three games a week for my summer sport soon as well! :D
@pinkladyapril Well its a start!
There is a possible up to 13 more @FlashTheatre15 shows to add, and of course the monthly @FOFStorytelling
@Ms_Malaprop @NN_Cafe Sadly I am unavailable tomorrow, although the very thought of an anarchist cook sounds interesting.
@Ms_Malaprop Delightful!
A bit of tidying up on my theatre list done, so I know where I am meant to be and when! 
Using a guillotine is oddly satisfying... 
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Happy to take the position of Whipping Boy of Quizzes. @Wizross
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal It would hardly be recording for me then.
I am destined to post videos of me playing golf or doing yoga then.
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal *brings out default image* 
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal You couldn't hit a police car with a rocket launcher!
Storms look delicious in GTA5.
@SAJ_Toots That is perfectly fine. I hope there were no spiders in them.
@SAJ_Toots Good morning Sally and welcome to the 3am club.
This is a recorded message to inform you that drinks are prepared and waiting.
@RDYouthTheatre Got a little collection of @NTConnections tickets today. 
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 Tonight I have done yoga in a computer game. How did this happen in my life?
@Wizross @toosurreal @PyramidHead76 I now have that tune in my head!
@SAJ_Toots I shall state now that my wrong answer this time came from an app crash.
@PyramidHead76 Not bad start Mr Spielberg. I was enjoying it until that moment of failed animal conservation.
@SAJ_Toots This will continue until you finally submit victory to me you know.
@Wizross That would be my real name of "kevin.evans.3139".
Now that you know that thought, I am afraid that I have got to kill you.
@PyramidHead76 "This video is private. Sorry about that."
@FlashTheatre15 The first stage of booking has commenced! 
Heading of to @RoyalDerngate for a bit of politics.
I suspect that I won't find it as much fun as my usual trips there.
@SAJ_Toots Mine are much the same, but without the educated part.
However I just maxed out then, so I am happier now. :D
@SAJ_Toots If I never, ever see another question on the Hunger Games or blooming Harry Potter, I will die a happy person!
@NickBieberHP Bedford
@SAJ_Toots Feeling your pain. <CONFOUNDED FACE>
@SAJ_Toots Even in the limited time, I feel black and blue. :D

@LeithesITV Great couple of reports from Colditz this week Mr Leithes. Really interesting stuff.
@blabers Hmm not sure then.
I know we went to Granada and MFI down there, but that was years ago and I think they are both closed now.
@blabers This one?

@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots @Wizross Ah yes concentrate on my strengths.
Ok let me think.
Yes.
Right.
Erm.
Err.
Nope. Sorry. I've got nothing.
@SAJ_Toots *prepares to send challenge*
This can only end in embarrassment and tears, and I know who for...

@toosurreal Green Man Gaming is still the cheapest I think with the coupon.
@SAJ_Toots EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Happy St George's Day! 
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Rubbish you say. Hmmm...
@SAJ_Toots This is the kind of common sense I try to avoid.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Hey @BrettMcMaster you could have let him sleep at least a bit.
@SAJ_Toots Good night Toots! I shall prepare the drinks now in advance.
They may have spiders in them by 3 though.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Neither have I, but I go with my tweet and also declare it rubbish as well.
#JudgementalMoi
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 / desperation game
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Have neither watched, recorded or have any intention of 4oding it. However I declare it rubbish.
#JudgementalMoi
@PyramidHead76 I have missed killing people today.
@PyramidHead76 Mostly looks feasible. Hope it works. Good luck!
@PyramidHead76 Well if there is only one other person, you are officially screwed.
Should fix it maybe in six months. If you are lucky.
@RoyalDerngate No show for me. BOO!
However I shall be there for this. Should be interesting.
@masutherland It's Shakespeare innit! I won't have a clue what to write (much as always I suppose). ;)
@masutherland A POX ON THAT PAYWALL! I CURSE THEE @thetimes!

@SAJ_Toots Two weeks!!!!
*climbs under bed*
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Yeah right...
@BA_Actors @RoyalDerngate *falls into a Shakespeare fit on the floor*
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 What about getting GTA5 though?
@PyramidHead76 I'll have a look when I have finished the game...
@PyramidHead76 Haven't been near editor myself so can't comment. Been too busy playing the game. I realise the editor is new thing to you!
@PyramidHead76 Fix them bugs, one by one...
@PyramidHead76 Not the same problem by the looks of it anyway.
@PyramidHead76 "YouTube uploads via Rockstar Editor will now correctly resume if Internet con is lost during the upload and later restored"
@PyramidHead76 There is a YouTube item listed in some patch details, but I think this was the one the other day. Today seems iFruit specific
@Furryous1 Break a leg Sir!
@PyramidHead76 Another GTA5 patch... #justsaying
@PyramidHead76 @Wizross Yeah I know what you mean Minnie the Minx did nothing for me either.

Just me? Oh...
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots @Wizross Harvard Man or Cruel Intentions is better material for this anyway.

So I am told anyway, by a friend...

@62drapes I hope "your friend" gets there in time.

@BBCNorthampton I don't think the prerecorded pieces from Independent and Green candidates should have been included. A debate is live.
@BBCNorthampton A lot of cheek @davidmackintosh saying let people decide over Europe. He didn't listen to public over his council decisions.
@chrispoppe @RoyalDerngate Much better.
Tell her that I feel her pain.
@BWellbelove Congratulations on the Worcester Rep role. Superb news and well deserved.

@WildeV You could use the manual recording option to set it?
It still cleverly tells you the programme title when recorded.
@PandaHQSky Thank you for your concern ma'am.
@PandaHQSky I like my parkrun! I can survive an occasional strain. :)
@PandaHQSky I believe that it is from my parkrun yesterday. Oddly I tend to get neck and shoulder moments while running. Weak points maybe.
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster You might end up eating them.
@PandaHQSky Apart from a stiff...

... neck, I am fine.
@PandaHQSky You say the nicest things.
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster Well it might, depends how tough you are. ;)
Just a lot of blood and some, uncomfortable moments.
@BrettMcMaster @SAJ_Toots and gets really messy and icky...
@PyramidHead76 Yes. Probably not encountered them all yet.
@PyramidHead76 I got a few hours in as well. I met Trevor for the first time also. Quite insane.
No golf or tennis today though. <DISAPPOINTED FACE>

@Wizross @toosurreal @PyramidHead76 No that is $100 in a secluded area.
This should be violence and death, not love and deuce.
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster Another wrong answer!
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 In other news I have loaded up GTA5 and am playing tennis.
Why am I not killing people? 
@PandaHQSky Is that all I get?
I demand a refund!
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster You are all inferior to the true Quiz Up champion...

@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal I'd still like a Red Dead Redemption on PC...
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 Yep! My dream GTA is Clauda from 3 who keeps quiet driving around San Andreas to the Vice City soundtrack.
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal I loved the BMX. Go away...
;)
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal Surprising. It's the one I have gone back to the most, although the character is not the best. The scope is huge.
@SAJ_Toots Absolutely no offense taken. I quite enjoy hearing all the startling takes on it. Before I was ignored. ;)
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal I have fondest memories of SA of all of them. Really finding the freedom of GTA5 near to that one, but prettier.

@PyramidHead76 @WhatKateDoes However for me it is running smoothly and I am just grateful that it runs well after 4.
@PyramidHead76 @WhatKateDoes Yes definitely some moments of ugliness. I was most put out at one point by some very primitive bush textures.
@PyramidHead76 Did you ever get the game going last  night?
@PyramidHead76 Well yes I noticed. :(
Also you didn't have your willy out as a school bus appeared either.
@PyramidHead76 Yes, sorry for the patches. Not that I am personally responsible for them.
@PyramidHead76 But it is great, it isn't GTA4.
@WhatKateDoes It run superb for me today and hopefully will for you when you get it going.
No GTA4 scenario for me.
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek *says nothing*
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek *is immediately disappointed*
@RiggerTheGeek @PandaHQSky *observes answer*
@RiggerTheGeek @PandaHQSky As if that's ever going to be enforced. If we did she would make her own.
"Confessions of a coal deliverer."
@RiggerTheGeek @PandaHQSky I've never been so insulted!
Well I have, but rude...
@RiggerTheGeek @PandaHQSky No privacy around here!
*shuns fame*
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek I will retweet this tweet for £250.
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek There was never really any doubt.
@PandaHQSky Indeed you are!
@PandaHQSky I love how nearly every conversation with you makes it way to sex in someway. ;)
@PandaHQSky Got to be positive about things! :D
@PandaHQSky I am very well! The sun is out and all is good with the world!!!
@PandaHQSky *hug* ;)
@chrispoppe Yes had to assume that it (and the others) are OK, but the performances on Oliviers didn't do them any justice for me.
@PandaHQSky Who are you?
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal Fair enough, but what about GTA5?
@SAJ_Toots I have no pants on at this moment.
The parcel man was quite perturbed.
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 Well early days, but I can report it is running like a dream so far. Looks lush as well. 
@littleknits88 @kevinmckeever @NorthamptonBC I challenge thee to get a picture of this box without rubbish sometime! ;)
Now remind me, did I have anything to do today?

@beadjoux I was in the crowd for a bit of the Ross Noble Freewheeling show. A mere dot on the screen. :)
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 Blimey what happened there! ;)
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 It wasn't the hair there that was the problem...
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 I got rejected for having one they felt might be too offensive.
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 This is getting quite outrageous!
@PyramidHead76 How very dare you!
I have been on TV again. Do I get repeat fees?
@BrettMcMaster You miserable old fart! ;)
@Ms_Malaprop The mind boggles!
@chrispoppe I didn't realise that your friends in front were quite that bad. A box for you it is! Silence was golden where I was!
Holy moly! :O

@The_Ambassador_ @playgoeswrong GO YOU ELEPHANT TRUNK HOLDERS YOU!!!
@amarab04 Well there is nothing I have seen that I would recommend more and booking till Feb next year now, so no excuse!
@amarab04 It is better than good.
@amarab04 I was totally happy Play Goes Wrong won though. The rest of the awards mattered not after that! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@amarab04 To be honest none of the performances bothered me much, whether it was something about the recording I don't know. Bit odd.
@amarab04 No far from the best I heard as well. Never going to be near the masters, but was a bit iffy.
@amarab04 Why did Sweeney win nothing but sunny afternoon basically cleaned up not okay
@NickBieberHP @NorthamptonUK I think it was a mistake to run this story at all, and blurring now is too late. Original picture still on TL.
@BBCNorthampton Award winning radio going on at the moment. We are not worthy! ;)
Here are my two non-@OlivierAwards winning reviews of #Oliviers winning @playgoeswrong: 

and

@PyramidHead76 @WhatKateDoes Remain calm. There is absolutely nothing to worry about. In any way.
A Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Mackintosh Party - Northampton South: 
@NorthamptonUK @NickBieberHP Will there be a recording done of this for online?
There's no better winner than @playgoeswrong for introducing new people to theatre. Interesting, accessible and just incredibly funny. (2/2)
I have seen a few of nominations and winners of #Oliviers last night, mostly via @ntlive and while all are no doubt worthy winners. (1/2)
#GoodMorningBobTalbot
@LydiaRoseBlagg Can't recommend it highly enough.
@LydiaRoseBlagg Not spoiling too much, but there is a little audience interaction at the start with a random audience member.
@LydiaRoseBlagg Yep!
And of course my claim to fame, which I hardly mention (only everyday), is that I briefly appeared on stage during it.
@LydiaRoseBlagg It is! I spoilt myself and saw it three times last year. :)
@LydiaRoseBlagg Overwhelmingly well deserved!
Seriously though the most well deserved @playgoeswrong! You are all awesome @mischiefcomedy
#Oliviers
I have officially starred in an #Oliviers winning play.
I thank the rest of the @playgoeswrong cast and @NancyWallinger for the opportunity.
@chrispoppe Please be standing under the clock with an aspidistra pinned to your lapel so that I may find you.
@BrettMcMaster I thought you were coming to the Derngate!
#StoodUpAgain
@Woah_say_what You rebel!
While I mustn't take too much credit, I am sure that my mantlepiece holding act had some impact on @playgoeswrong @OlivierAwards nomination.
@helenchick91 Well done for refraining young lady. Impressive restraint.
@NancyWallinger He is murmuring NAAAANNNNNCCYYYY! under his breath.
@helenchick91 Well you can, but...
@TheatreTherapy @mudbeast76 Now I am VERY disappointed that I missed it!
@BrettMcMaster While this offer looks somewhat appealing. It also equally feels slightly alarming.
Looks like I am going to have a theatre box to myself again tonight.

I reckon someone is trying to tell me something...
Tonight this commoner is @RoyalDerngate for highbrow entertainment of Christoph Koenig Conducts Beethoven And Elgar.

@mischiefcomedy Be careful with the white spirit on the suits. Never really mixes.
@TheatreTherapy @mudbeast76 You are more my favourite!
@SAJ_Toots My abdominals look much the same really. I would show you, but @PyramidHead76 would only be jealous.
@SAJ_Toots I did because this guy was watching BGT last night, so I see no reason why not...
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots and you wonder why businesses love the tories...
@circlereviews Before my theatre time and a Google search has come up empty. @mudbeast76 or @RoyalDerngate will maybe reveal more.
@Tallestpurpl Yes it was definitely an odd directorial decision.
@RoyalDerngate The very cheek! Don't you know who I am!
;) 
My review of #Cyrano de Bergerac at Royal &amp; Derngate to Saturday 25th April:

#SundayBlogShare
@pinkladyapril @amstagemanager Stop this luvie love on my timeline at this time of a Sunday morning!
@pinkladyapril Yes probably not if you are up at this time.
@anglesey42 Should be on the first Sunday of the month now until October.
@mudbeast76 I am hardly containing myself with the excitement!
@anglesey42 General hospital
@anglesey42 Car boot!
Standing in a car park 
@pinkladyapril As drunk as a choir master!
@AlicePiper1 Happy Birthday Dimple!!!
@WildeV That is one thing I shall not be doing! ;)
However do so if you must. :)
@WildeV :) Shall miss not seeing them this year. Only seen their one show last year, but hysterically mad!
@WildeV Well yes, I hate Shakespeare, but I shall of course have lots of hope! :)
@WildeV Definitely agree. If that's the worst Made In Northampton this year, they won't have done too bad.
Fingers crossed!
@WildeV Ah yes forgot that. Slightly better, but still a little late after a long one.
I remain happy I saw it though. :)
@WildeV I am certain I would have disliked it more if I had left at 11pm than 5:45pm as well. ;)
@WildeV I see you had a little trouble with that one. It's a weird one. Despite odd gym/production, I did enjoy it. A matinee play for me.
@meal_deal Classic! Love that cover as well.
@mudbeast76 Pleased you enjoyed. It is an interestingly different play.
@mudbeast76 Ah only someone I follow moaning again as ever. Not sure why I follow really. No harm done Jim.
Enjoy Our Town?
Some peoples glasses are not only half empty.

They have a dirty great crack in them where their soul, I mean drink is oozing out.
@PyramidHead76 @Littlemisskatyb Because you are watching BGT. It drains the intellect.
@SAJ_Toots Such filth! I could never watch that.

*googles*
@SAJ_Toots Oh I say! 
@theEricaM Indeed! Painful to watch.
I hear the men's cox went lame as well.
@PyramidHead76 *unfollows*
I must admit I had the most trouble with that Chair jump.

If it hadn't been for that guy on my back it would have been much easier.

Horse racing
Boat race

@SAJ_Toots We shall slay the naysayers and feast upon their dried blood!
#BlackPuddingGate
@NorthamptonUK @NickBieberHP I think it would have been the right thing to do to have obscured his face.
@SAJ_Toots Ah yes, well as it comes actually. Although not had any for a little while now. #BlackPuddingGate
@SAJ_Toots I just eat it? What am I meant to do with it? Cut it into animal shapes?
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots * throws banana *
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 The usual. Promises the world, then runs away.
@SAJ_Toots This better not be happening again @PyramidHead76!
@SAJ_Toots Sorry ma'am!
@kevinmckeever Thanks very much!
@kevinmckeever I received a letter from you today. In the letter you referenced a YouGov poll. Where can details of this be seen?
@SAJ_Toots I only threw a banana at him!
Anne Hathaway's Wrecking Ball vs. Emily Blunt's Piece of My Heart | Lip ...: 
@bigfinish Don't know whether you would be interested in seeing this auction I have seen?

@velvet_engine That will £100 for the professional consultation.
@velvet_engine My professional* advice would be no.

*not professional in any way
I forgot to mention the wind.
And the cold.
Where did spring go?
@Judgys Very breezy! Don't mind the rain myself.
Horrible stitch put pay to a good time though. <FLUSHED FACE>
Getting a bit damp, but of to the @Northampparkrun all the same.
I got: The Smiths! Which 80s Alt. Group Wrote The Soundtrack Of Your Life? 
@Judgys Hope you didn't get too wet then! ;)
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots If you leave it 40 minutes you will have gone tonight and tomorrow.
@Woah_say_what @ArteNicholas Won't sleep now.
@Judgys Have your nap. See you at the Racecourse in the morning...
@Woah_say_what @ArteNicholas Fortunately he doesn't know were I live!

Well actually I suppose its narrowed down to 70 doors. :O
@angel_sop Usually me doing the hiding!
Yes very different play in content and style. Enjoyed it.
@ArteNicholas @Woah_say_what I got away from him. He was still not sure about his keys though. ;)
@Ef4vescent The Masque Theatre were performing Our Town. :)
@angel_sop I was looking round, I thought you hadn't made as didn't spot you.
Yep loved it again, a touch more lively than first night.
Tonight's venue 
My review of #Cyrano de Bergerac at the Royal &amp; Derngate until Saturday 25th April:

@jllybeans That one is truly superb.
Back for a second helping of Masque Theatre's Our Town tonight.

@BrettMcMaster @SAJ_Toots @toosurreal While I respect the BBC, I am not sure of their flip flop/sandals credentials either. #HotPotato
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster @toosurreal Right, remain calm and listen to the funny voiced lady: 
@BrettMcMaster @SAJ_Toots @toosurreal 
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster @toosurreal Now why did you have to go and tell him that! :D
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster @toosurreal I feel that sneakers moment coming on again.
*runs for cover*
@jllybeans New computers rarely come out of shops fully up to date. Certainly nothing personal.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots A barren wasteland here. Not even a cat.
@WildeV Shall keep a look out.
Managed to put my thoughts in words, was an odd one. Barrett exceptional though.
@toosurreal @SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster I just got two as well. I played it twice...
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster I am always up for a challenge! Whenever I have been in a league I have always been the strongest in it... ;)
@WildeV Has your review gone live yet? Had a look but couldn't find it.
@SAJ_Toots @BrettMcMaster Trivia Crack is where is at now!
My review of #Cyrano de Bergerac @RoyalDerngate 
@PyramidHead76 @toosurreal I got mine on PlayCycle sometime back and I got a code for Social Club to download it from.
@toosurreal @PyramidHead76 If you use the 22% voucher @GreenManGaming it is £31.20 at the moment.
@PyramidHead76 However it looks delicious and promises to be a proper conversion job this time. *fingers crossed*
@PyramidHead76 Go away...
*unfollows*
@PyramidHead76 Have you got a lock pick Mr Crump? 
Two more evenings to see this!
My review of Our Town performed by the Masque Theatre, Northampton: 
@WildeV #random
@NickBieberHP You need to find him and interview him!
#GoodnightBobTalbot
Piers Morgan coming soon to #bbcqt 

I want to die.
@amarab04 I grew up watching Charlene and Scott. Those were the days!
@amarab04 And a few before you were about as well child! :)
Very very dull #bbcqt tonight.

Needed Bob Talbot and Marlon on the panel really.
@pinkladyapril Thank you! Although I don't think my secret is safe with me anymore. Willy nilly revealing now! :)
@pinkladyapril Don't you go telling people you have seen me! ;)
@pinkladyapril I shall try to do my bit anyway.
@pinkladyapril Tomorrow will be even better! :)
@blabers Enjoy your break, and I suspect a happy reprieve from the overdose of politics going on.
@Npton_Adviser @KazShakespeare I shall prepare a statement that I request you to tweet tomorrow...
@Npton_Adviser @KazShakespeare To be liked to that chap is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen! :O
@theEricaM Only one hour to survive tonight! ;)

@CarolAnnPhotos I wasn't but it looked like @KazShakespeare was!

Our Town by The Masque Theatre at The Holy Sepulchre until Saturday.
My review:

@IzySommerfield @Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe Rather glorious indeed. Have a look at the pic that @nigelandlouise has tweeted as well ;)
@Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe @IzySommerfield I think it's one of those that I can look on more favorably for having seen a matinee.
@serial_miller Northampton South for MP, Castle for council.
@Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe @IzySommerfield Happy to report that I came away more than happy. Nigel Barrett was simply exceptional for me.
4 people followed me // automatically checked by 
@chrispoppe @RoyalDerngate Well unless you are a very slow writer...
Once more to the theatre for a matinee of Cyrano de Bergerac @RoyalDerngate 

@chaterfranks @NickBieberHP Yes at least I can nearly have hope, no matter how slim in Northampton South.
@chaterfranks @NickBieberHP I suspect little effort is put into yours sadly because that is a one party area. Never going to change that.
@NickBieberHP I even know what some of my PPC's look 
Iike now. Not had any specific leaflets from any other than the main two in the door.
@NickBieberHP Well done! Appreciate the effort to get it this right.
It did seem only fair.
@serial_miller @NickBieberHP @kardisom In the interests of balance, time I dug my picture out again. 
@kardisom @NickBieberHP Indeed just crazy to include one picture. Four pictures would have been simple. Disappointing.
@NorthamptonUK In the interest of balance, you might have at least used all four of the picture options you have on Twitter.
@BBCNorthampton That lady is an utter disgrace talking over everyone. Totally unacceptable.
@chrispoppe @StephenBennettt Betamax or Video 2000?
#StopHoggingTheQuiltBobTalbot
@StephenBennettt @chrispoppe A great surreal show, and having spent all of my (nearly) 38 years here, I like Northampton! So there!
@chrispoppe @StephenBennettt You WILL LOVE the appearance of a certain Mr Mackintosh. Classic!
@chrispoppe @StephenBennettt Dave is a freeview channel I believe now as well.
@chrispoppe @StephenBennettt It's repeated 23:20 on Sunday, 20:00 on Monday.
@StephenBennettt @chrispoppe Repeated Sunday I think, or online as well.
@chrispoppe @StephenBennettt Freewheeling episode last night on channel Dave was in Northampton. Yours truly was also in crowd at end.
@StephenBennettt @realrossnoble #HelloBobTalbot
#GoodnightBobTalbot
@LydiaRoseBlagg @catgarlick Was she crying? Must have been crying. Always crying.
@KazShakespeare @cta1000 You wave like crazy, I stand there just filming. You are obviously having more fun.
Think I was baffled by it all.
@PyramidHead76 Periscope?
I know everything, but seemingly nothing.
@PyramidHead76 You could stream your man flu via Meerkat!
#UpWithTech
@KazShakespeare Didn't have that one. Only this one, the one that someone spotted me in. 
Going to say #HelloBobTalbot and watch it again. And why not!
@SAJ_Toots I can't really fully understand the horror of it, although on the occasions I have struggled, its horrible. For regular, just :(
@SAJ_Toots Oh that is ugly. I have the utmost sympathy. :(
@SAJ_Toots *sniffs*
@PandaHQSky I will arrange an interview as soon as possible.
@PandaHQSky I greatly fear saying "list away". :O
@PandaHQSky I wouldn't say no! ;)
@PandaHQSky Oh you know, autographs all day. The phone ringing off the hook nonstop.
My review of Our Town performed by The Masque Theatre at The Holy Sepulchre until Saturday:

@amstagemanager My pleasure. All being well I shall be back for a second helping Friday.
#HelloBobTalbot *waves*
@Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe @IzySommerfield Public Reviews gave it 4*, interestingly same reviewer gave Regeneration 2*

@ChronandEcho but maybe that are leaders are? If not that, very, very embarrassing.
@chrispoppe @IzySommerfield @Ms_Malaprop Yes these pro critics are all over the shop. You would think its a personal opinion or something!
@angel_sop Ah well, might see you then. Hoping to get a second helping on Friday.
@angel_sop All I want really is a huge clout on Mr Binley's current majority just to bring him down a peg or two.
@angel_sop ... a swing though for him not to get in. Generally very Conservative I am afraid, apart from that Tony Clarke moment.
@angel_sop Yes I doubt the average Conservative voter is a Ross Noble/Dave viewer, but I might be being unkind. Going to take a heck of...
@angel_sop The point really is that lighthearted show had no axe to grind. Therefore you have to believe it don't you? Utterly sad.
@angel_sop It was an ugly affair all round. However I am afraid it reinforced everything many say about the Mack controlling nature.
@pinkladyapril Thanks, all fixed. I am sure no one noticed! :D
My review of Our Town performed by The Masque Theatre, Northampton at The Holy Sepulchre:

@pinkladyapril Oops! DELETE! DELETE! DELETE!
Hey! Mr @davidmackintosh watch Ross Noble: Freewheeling Online, you come across really well! 
| On Demand | UKTV Play 
Watching @realrossnoble's Northampton #freewheeling again to make sure it really happened.
@_Miss_Milkshake I like that dialect! :)
@blabers Could have been worse.
@WildeV Sounds about right. Seen many a confused opinion already.
Look forward to seeing the review.
@blabers You silly ars... ;)
@WildeV What did you reckon of Cyrano then? Seeing comments all over the place for this one.
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 You think us so shallow?*

*we are
@KazShakespeare That rules me out then. :(
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 Ah but I still remember that photo of you and that must be more than six months now! ;)
(Might not be)
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 Ahh! What! I feel violated!
@SAJ_Toots Good night Tooty!
@PandaHQSky I am sure I can find some coal somewhere...
@NickBieberHP The front of my face made an appearance. People are in counselling now across the land.
Tonight is the night I was exposed!

This time nothing to do with my trousers falling down.
@KazShakespeare Anyone on here you know? 
@SAJ_Toots Dave the channel, Ross Noble, Freewheeling.
@PandaHQSky It's disappointing I know.
@Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe I had a couple of them tonight. Dotty old ladies (with utmost respect).
@SAJ_Toots An inconsequential member of a crowd.
Ross Noble: My path to TV stardom!

Autographs are £10 each, plus £5.50 p&amp;p
@TheatreTherapy @Woah_say_what @mudbeast76 Friendly! You wait until my review! Mwhahaha... ;)
@SAJ_Toots Yes long gone now. Thankfully!
@blabers Fame at last!
@TheatreTherapy @Woah_say_what @mudbeast76 Thought I might pull a funny face to make you laugh. But my usual one worked...
@chaterfranks My Tina Turner impression is unique...
@PandaHQSky Well you know I have a beard...
@PandaHQSky That would be telling...
@PandaHQSky Nope.
@62drapes I knew that Ross Noble would be my downfall!
@PandaHQSky I had a camera in front of my face mostly.
I am on television!
@PandaHQSky I am in the crowd
@PandaHQSky Erm no that wasn't me.
@PhilWilliams I couldn't possibly comprehend how long the queue would be to help Hopkins with that euthanasia.
@chrispoppe @IzySommerfield @Ms_Malaprop You know this might back fire and we love it. Look at The Secret Adversary. You just never know!
@Woah_say_what @mudbeast76 @TheatreTherapy Ah but if you go right, you might get a DEATH STARE from @pinkladyapril 
#Dilemas
@Woah_say_what @mudbeast76 If you sit left you will also get the pleasure of the DEATH STARE from @TheatreTherapy
@mudbeast76 and @Woah_say_what
Sit first left section, or first right if you can for Our Town. Best views for most of performance.
@IzySommerfield @Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe This is sure going to be an interesting one.
@Woah_say_what For you lot "Odd" is standard. <WINKING FACE>
I thought that it is a very clever play though.
@chrispoppe @Ms_Malaprop Note: I haven't said I won't sleep through a play. <WINKING FACE>
@chrispoppe @Ms_Malaprop The important thing is "that I never leave a play"! EEK!

To the old ladies in front row: If you can't hear. Repeatedly talking about not hearing will not make it better for others to hear.
@Woah_say_what It is being heavily criticised by others here, but I am loving it. Very odd.
@Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe OMG! I was taking my father to this one. I fear he won't want to go when he hears that.
@TheatreTherapy I didn't notice a thing!
@Woah_say_what I think you will enjoy it. Loving it so far. Very interestingly different play.
@chrispoppe This is for you @Ms_Malaprop I believe.
Is it long then?

The Masque Theatre present 'Our Town' at Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 
Tkts: 
@Ms_Malaprop @chrispoppe That tweet sounds slightly worrying. ;)
@RuthSimone @pinkladyapril Aww that's a shame!
Two of the cast know me now anyway so I might have been outed anyway! :)
@RuthSimone Is this interview being recorded? Am I under arrest?
Solo trips mostly ma'am!
@pinkladyapril
@pinkladyapril @RuthSimone Ha! Blimey! :O
Probably nearly old enough to be her father, as I have now been mistaken for at Student shows!
@RuthSimone @pinkladyapril Was very disappointed that you weren't. I even picked you for it in my Beckett review!
I am indeed male!
@chrispoppe You shall know before me then. :)
@chrispoppe When are you seeing it anyway?
@RuthSimone @pinkladyapril The mystery is better than the reality believe me.
I actually sat in the same row as you at Into The Woods! ;)
@pinkladyapril I better or there will be trouble! ;)
@chrispoppe If they don't agree with us, they are wrong! :)
@chrispoppe Bit harsh already. It has only done two previews so far.
Guest night tonight though.
Also, I shall never leave a show!
Back to the theatre for me tonight at the Holy Sepulchre for Masque Theatre's Our Town

@chrispoppe Thank me when I have remembered it. :D
I shall hopefully be Bergeracing at the Thursday matinee.
@chrispoppe I am! I have a box all to myself (at present anyway).
I shall bring a copy of that long awaited Aftermath programme for you.
@chrispoppe Are you at Christoph Koenig at R&amp;D on Sunday night?
@PandaHQSky Sadly I shall not be seeing it myself tonight as I shall be out. I was at the place involving Red Dwarf's Kryton! ;)
@PandaHQSky That Ross Noble Freewheeling episode that I mentioned is on this evening. ;O
.@andrealeadsom talked most sense of the three on @blabers show. Not that it changes my vote as a certain DM is standing where I live.
It's too warm!
@WildeV I am relying on distant memories of Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah to remind me of all I need.
@blabers Yes I think so indeed. I also presently have a box to myself to get all uncontrollably emotional in. :D
@mischiefcomedy There is a script?!?
#mindblown
;)
@WildeV Guest night. How exciting! Enjoy.
@blabers The Beethoven/Elgar performance on Sunday. <VIOLIN><MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><MUSICAL NOTE><MUSICAL SCORE>
Just purchased my most expensive R&amp;D ticket yet for type of show I would never have thought about going to five weeks ago.
@Npton_Labour *Sekhemka
@PandaHQSky *flashes nipple back*
*tears shirt in process*
Worries for another day
Let the music play (clap clap)
Down at fraggle rock 
@PandaHQSky *presents a lump of coal*
@PandaHQSky I'll give that a nine.
Just had an awesome view of the #ISS
@chaterfranks @CraigS0309 That will be St Giles Church.
@pinkladyapril Yes I shall be on the lookout for this one now.
My review of Jesus Christ Superstar (2000 Stage Version) at My Living Room, Northampton:

@chrispoppe @blabers 
@chrispoppe @blabers I only remember toenail painters.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Sorry about my inability to help.
I am happy to hit that swollen lip though...
@Judgys @exerciseworks This is most excellent news. See you next Saturday at the Racecourse. Don't forget your barcode! ;)
@chrispoppe @blabers I went:
James Fox can sing?
He played Judas?
How long ago was that?

Then I googled James Fox.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots You missed my favourite: HIT it with a stick!
3 people unfollowed me // automatically checked by 
@SAJ_Toots @f8andbethere AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!
It's coming for me!
@pinkladyapril The trials of modern day life.
@SAJ_Toots @f8andbethere Thank you. I shan't sleep tonight now as it is.
@SAJ_Toots @f8andbethere I don't want to talk about it.
@helenchick91 We can be sick together! :)
@blabers Happy that I have learnt to like it though. It is actually very entertaining once you can actually hear it all.
@blabers I still stand by some of my criticism. I think the music was too overpowering at Derngate and Judas I saw wasn't up to much.
I feel quite sick now.
@PandaHQSky Never too late!
*eats chocolate*

I may be some time...
@f8andbethere @SAJ_Toots It's not an old wives tale. They will kill you!
@SAJ_Toots @f8andbethere and they can't touch you for it.
@PyramidHead76 Thank you Doctor Crump.
@PyramidHead76 That's what I said.
@SAJ_Toots Don't mind if I do. Thank you.
@SAJ_Toots @f8andbethere Coming for you.
With purpose.
To kill you.
@blabers He was very good. It was very good.
@SAJ_Toots @f8andbethere Thought you might like that. :)
@helenchick91 We shall be weird together then! :)
@helenchick91 To be honest I am not a huge chocolate person, so its not a hard deal.
Shall have some in a minute though. ;)
@PandaHQSky @RiggerTheGeek I didn't mean to tell you that the Titanic sank. Sorry.
Seeing Rik Mayall as King Herod today though has made it a good day, despite a distinct lack of chocolate.
It's 8:35pm on Easter Sunday and I haven't yet eaten any chocolate.

I fail at Easter.
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 Fascinating also to see two in it who were at Derngate despite it being 15 years ago. Plus the wonderful Rik Mayall.
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 Happy to report that it was very good and my thoughts about production rather than content were perhaps justified.
@Woah_say_what The professor is glad to have been of service.
@Woah_say_what We are all regressing into our former beast state.

@Woah_say_what A very good question.
*strokes beard in contemplation*
@blabers *waves smelling salts*
Remain calm!
...and breath.
Suitable viewing for Easter. 
@Judgys I am sure we will get round any such issues when needs must.
Happy Easter everybody! 
@Judgys You know what you are going to have to do after that... ;)

Happy Easter Jo and Mr Jo!
@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 Especially if he has coal with him...
My phone is about to go sleep, so I might not get to finish this twee
@RoyalDerngate @CraigS0309 Indeed, March last year I found it was #nevertoolate, now it's #nevergetaway
:D
@PyramidHead76 Never seen it. Not watching it now.

#FascinatingTweet
The Masque Theatre present 'Our Town' at Church of the Holy Sepulchre. 
Tkts: 
@PyramidHead76 No elephants or yeti in this one yet. :( 
@OccupyNton While I support your cause and many opinions. I don't think that the offensively toned board you are carrying helps it in anyway
@Judgys Life can be so cruel sometimes.
@Judgys Cats preventing you from moving. A common problem.
Run was average for me. People there are getting hige though. Booming it is.
@Judgys Missed you at the parkrun again...

One day... one day... ;)
I should officially be standing in a field now However today I shall now be parkrunning instead.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots I also have a strongman now. 
Have you heard ‘The ULTIMATE 60s MEGAMIX’ by DJ*S on #SoundCloud? #np 
@PyramidHead76 In search of furry creatures... 
@RoyalDerngate Break a leg everyone, but hopefully not a nose.
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 Yes shall look out for that as well. Was most interested in this version first as Jesus is the same chap I saw.
My books have never looked quite so polished so close to the end of the year.

Something has surely yet to go wrong.
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 I shall be doing some proper research over the weekend chaps.
#PainstakingResearch 
@chrispoppe They most certainly are. I would do everything for Lena, even that toenail bit.
@chrispoppe Yes and my underwear was newly purchased as well.
@chrispoppe I am very disappointed! I loved Lena.
@SAJ_Toots You too Tooty!
@chrispoppe No Lena? :(
@mudbeast76 HAPPY EASTER!

@PandaHQSky That's not like you at all. ;)
@PandaHQSky Ah. Right. I think we were talking about different things.
It is a nice pipe.
@PandaHQSky Certainly never. However I doubt it is appropriate to put a picture of my pipe on Twitter.
@PandaHQSky Oh my golly gosh...
@PandaHQSky Now if only I had an impressive pipe...
@PandaHQSky How about vacuum salesman? With an impressive pipe.
@theEricaM Such thoughtfulness! :)
@PandaHQSky How are you with double glazing salesman?
@PandaHQSky Stop spoiling my dreams!
@chaterfranks I sat there putting pointless things on Twitter. You win.
@PandaHQSky *disguises as coal man and clears Wednesday diary*
@chaterfranks BBC tracky thingy (technical term) apparently: 
David Dimbleby auditioning for The X-Factor there.
#bbcqt
Only just found out that everyone mentioning the worm wasn't actually talking about one of the panelists in #leadersdabate
Two hours of #leadersdabate, now an hour of #bbcqt.

I am on suicide watch at this point.
@PandaHQSky Can never not have enough protection. You never know when the coal man might call.
@NickBieberHP Alcohol sellers.
@Ms_Malaprop @FOFStorytelling @NN_Cafe You can go of people you know. *unfollowers*
Goodnight and do have nightmares.
#LeadersDebate 
Seven politicians stare. Stare into your very soul. And rootle about your insides. Eat your kidney, your lungs, your heart...
#LeadersDebate
@blabers Oh, no other question.
Final question: Should Jeremy Clarkson have been sacked from Top Gear?
#LeadersDebate
Sadly Farage is still there.
#LeadersDebate
And the doors go bang! Somebody has been ejected I feel. 
#LeadersDebate
Farage: the ultimate stuck record.
#leadersdebate
@RiggerTheGeek Currently attending Relate until May 7th.
SHUT YOUR BLEEDING CAKE HOLES!!!!
#leadersdebate
When do the divorce papers come throught between Cameron and Clegg? I have seen this type of emotional breakup before. :'(
#leadersdebate
@blabers I started listening on 5live. I tend to wish I had stayed that way.
*shudders*
@blabers Oh, I suppose they might make it now the "bigger" NHS and immigration are done.
@blabers Time for one more question methinks then.
How long is this #leadersdebate? Even the bleeding Titanic had sunk by this time.
@Ms_Malaprop @FOFStorytelling @NN_Cafe You won the raffle. How... Delightful...
;)
Was a great night!
@WildeV No more Chinese takeaways if Farage gets in.
@ArteNicholas &amp; @Woah_say_what been busy tonight then with @tonyclarkeuk? :D
Before the #leadersdebate I was a teetotal. 
Leave Farage till last, with luck his heart might give out with the anticipation.
#leadersdebate
Farage is foaming at the mouth now.
#leadersdebate
@FOFStorytelling My pleasure. I would actually have written more, but wanted to get it up for Northants Hour and hadn't had much time today.
The issue after the break is immigration. Oh how, simply, delightful. Someone take out Farage during the break please.
#leadersdebate
#NorthantsHour
My review of @FOFStorytelling at @NN_Cafe 
@tonyclarkeuk Not in this instance.
@tonyclarkeuk I see two very dodgy characters in that bunch.
@chaterfranks @blabers Cameron was also looking into my soul a minute ago.
Imagine this on a sixty inch telly.
Oh god don't! What did I say!
@chaterfranks You seriously only saying there is only one Dopey?
#NorthantsHour
The Masque Theatre present Our Town at the Holy Sepulchre, Tuesday to Saturday, the 7th to 11th April. 
Good to see that Anne Robinson's latest face lift has been very successful.
#leadersdebate 
That Farage chap. Five rounds rapid!
#leadersdebate 
Are there no adverts tonight during the #leadersdebate. I want to know if the DFS sale is still on.
Open the floor. If only. I would happily watch them tumble into the abyss.
#LeadersDebate
So that's all we've got time for...

#LeadersDebate
I always preferred William G. Stewart if I am honest.
Is there anything on TV tonight?
I have won £2 on a £2 scratch card.

I think I might buy a £100,000 one while I  am on a roll.
Traffic is snarled up horrendously in Northampton!

Encouraging The Crowd: Putting Them Bottoms On Seats (@FlashTheatre15 UPDATE)

@PandaHQSky It proved quite entertaining while I was having a snack. ;)
@PandaHQSky May I interest you in any of this ma'am? 
@theEricaM Spreadsheets are your friend.
Blog: Encouraging The Crowd - Putting Them Bottoms On Seats

@RoyalDerngate @FlashTheatre15 @NTConnections @LGTheatre
Curious piece in @NorthamptonUK today. Running until May 28th @RoyalDerngate apparently! (Tip: It's not)
DOH! 
@SAJ_Toots Oh was it your birthday? I wish you had let us know.
@FOFStorytelling Excellent and entertaining evening. Nice venue although will it be big enough in the future! :)
Expect my blog review asap.
#ThatAwkwardMoment where you see your increasingly growing bald patch on Twitter.
@TheatreTherapy No problem.
Now all you need to do is to get better, so you can be well for when you are dead next week.
*confused face*
@PandaHQSky I knew it would be you who would reply to that.
Ooo pancakes!!!
I couldn't win a raffle if I was the only entry.

Not even the booby prize! *sigh*
@TheatreTherapy Just got back and excellently entertaining. Jo in particular is a star, but all were great fun.
Superb turnout as well.
@TheatreTherapy I hear you are poorly. I hope you are feeling better soon.
@SAJ_Toots Thanks! I am leaving my heels at home.
Just this once...
@SAJ_Toots Have a great birthday night!
@PandaHQSky How are the Shetlands at the moment? :P
@PandaHQSky ;)
@SAJ_Toots Will let you know!
Shall hopefully provide a review (given time) at some point.
@PandaHQSky Either that or travel all the way to London to see The Play That Goes Wrong. The perfect first play to experience!
@PandaHQSky Not sure where it is touring, but if you see Peter Pan Goes Wrong advertised. That would be one heck of a first play to see.
@PandaHQSky Ah, no question then go and experience it.
@PandaHQSky I think so. I am somewhat biased about theatre, but it's a great experience even if its only occasionally.
@PandaHQSky Well you never let me finish... hmmmph..
@PandaHQSky ... reviews are good. If you are a fan of Agatha Christie as well, a good live play can do no wrong.
@PandaHQSky Well depends I suppose. I haven't actually seen it, although I shall come September. However longest running play and tour...
@PandaHQSky Fire away!
So my empty theatre week, I've now found something to see. So tonight I shall be at @NN_Cafe for @FOFStorytelling. 
@FlashTheatre15 I bet you know what would be a good addition to this tweet. ;)
@pinkladyapril The racecourse is indeed a scary place in the wind, as my weekend trials of running against have told me. :D
Journey to post office:
One way - Ten minutes
Other way - FIIIIIIVVVEEEEE SECONDS
#YellowWind
@PandaHQSky There will be another time my fiendish one.
@PandaHQSky OM NOM NOM!
@PandaHQSky Today I am weak and submissive. Do what thee wish with me.
@PandaHQSky 
@PandaHQSky NEVAAARGGHH! I TELL THEE!

Well, depends, what do you mean by persuasive?
@RoyalDerngate Is there any deal available on booking multiple shows for the Connections performances?
@ChronandEcho @SaveSekhemka Well I suppose they hope so. Much like they were positive over who owned it in the first place.
@blabers Have a word with @WillyGilder about the car clock. ;)
@aelbourne1 @RoyalDerngate Yep had a look and sounds interesting. Love the image as well, very The Walking Dead.
@RoyalDerngate d'Artagnan has arrived! 
@SAJ_Toots Naughty Fluke!
@TheatreTherapy @amstagemanager I assume it was pretty cold in that room.
@mudbeast76 
@mudbeast76 Times (but not what shows) on R&amp;D website now for Connections. A lot at weekend so you may (if you wish) be able to see some.
@amarab04 Students... *sigh*
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Much better for you though.
#BirthdaySpoilSport
I love watching it go round in the washing machine.
I am washing my hair Twitter.

This is why you follow me folks for these magic moments.
I should imagine big businesses are happy with the Conservatives because they are getting away with murder over employment terms of staff.
@FOFStorytelling I assume tickets will be ok to be purchased at the door tonight?
@PandaHQSky NEVAAAAARRR!!!
@LydiaRoseBlagg Enjoy your day and don't get stressed by anything. Chill day!
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots What is this 3AM you speak of?
@LydiaRoseBlagg Happy birthday Lydia!
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 We all stopped up for this didn't we. Such dedication.
@SAJ_Toots I saw something somewhere. I must admit you were keeping it secret though.
@SAJ_Toots HAPPY BIRTHDAY SALLY! 
I think I shall have two birthdays this year like the Queen.
Especially as I can't seem to remember when mine is it seems...
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 I nearly had a personal premature celebration.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 I have just seen half balloons were missing!

@SAJ_Toots This is good to hear!
Muskehounds are always ready
One for all and all for one
Helping everybody.... 
@PandaHQSky I am better thank you. I have still a malingering bug, but I shall survive!
@PandaHQSky This I suppose is a fair statement.
@PandaHQSky I go away for ten minutes and come back to breasts all over my timeline. One pair would have sufficed, I cannot handle more.
@PandaHQSky That is a repeat! Please fetch some new ones.
@PandaHQSky OK then, back to the breasts then....
@PandaHQSky Bit of politics does no one any harm. As long as it is only a small bit. ;)
Interesting hearing Brian Binley talk to @ITVEmmaH on @itvanglia criticising everything that his perspective replacement @davidmackintosh is
@SAJ_Toots and tomorrow you will open the broken gifts...

@SAJ_Toots No opening early, you naughty girl!
Happy to report that I not only survived the #YellowWind, but have also mastered my moonwalking and got a free face lift into the bargain.
@masutherland @LorneCampbellNS @northernstage @RoyalDerngate 
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 They are quite wonderful!
OMG! THE WIND!
OMG! THE RAIN!
OMG! THE HAIL!
OH MY GOD NOAH!
WHERE ARE YOU WHEN I NEED YOU!
I am thinking that today is not the best day to wear my rather stylish sombrero.
I have got to go outside Twitter. I am quite frightened by this prospect.
#YellowWind
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots It's true. I missed my true vocation!
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 It's coming along well... 
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Yellow wind warning apparently. Be careful!
Not sure if this is worse that yellow snow warning myself though.
Ah look I might have found something theatreish this week after all - @FOFStorytelling opening night tomorrow at 7.30 @NN_Cafe

@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 All the clever people celebrate their birthday on the first of the month. *not subtle hint*
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 That makes two of us.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Say what, eh, what, er, pardon, erm, yeah, err, no.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Ah yes that delightful time of year. Why would you not indeed rejoice in the arrival of April!
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Why would some do cartwheels for the start of April? *strokes chin*
@Woah_say_what Don't tweet with your mouth full! I know you are. Stop it!
@SAJ_Toots HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

Oh, sorry, suffered from premature celebration then.

How embarrassing...
My 4* review of @SAdversary at Royal &amp; Derngate last week, and opens @ebtheatres tomorrow.

@mudbeast76 @TheatreTherapy Great stuff! I have such a drought at the moment, I might even go twice. :)
@mudbeast76 @TheatreTherapy Oh great! You are going to be able to get to see it.
@callum_jones22 They were just testing the 'functionality' of his media team to pickup stories...
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Get a grip on it, and offend away, you of course no I would never block you.
@ChronandEcho He feels mistreated by an official body which was set-up long before his pointless existence. One moment I shall pass a hankey
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Why all this sitting on the fence? Just stick it out there...
@Lord_Monteagle @ChronandEcho This, tea rooms and Sekhemka. Today is an interesting day.
@Lord_Monteagle @ChronandEcho Very, very interesting.

Could happen to anyone, hopefully...
@TheatreTherapy You are in it sold it! ;)
All being well, I should make opening night for this one.

@mudbeast76 I approve the Maxine Peake part, less so the Hamlet bit. ;)

@TheatreTherapy I keep telling everyone how brilliant it is.
You shall have had a great evening by the time you read this.

I hope you stopped until the end end.
@sharonlucey1 @brackleyhippy @lindadawson34 *highly suspicious face*
@theEricaM Simply put, it is awesome. You will most certainly enjoy it.
@dusthouse Who will also be hanging on my wall next month looking dangerous. 
@dusthouse That would be the lovely Catrin Stewart!
@KazShakespeare @Boltonparkrun It was dry at the Northampton one. Although horrifically windy at times.
@chrispoppe A lean period indeed! My next trip is not until 7th either.
Things to remember for May 7th!

@BrettMcMaster One case where I am happy to be proven wrong.
@BrettMcMaster Maybe, but because they are wood. I have a slight worry there might be worse. Hope not though as agree they look great.
@BrettMcMaster Until end of August apparently. If they survive certain individuals.
@BrettMcMaster Just a little thing to celebrate a couple of anniversary (mainly Magna Carta).

*takes catapult from @SAJ_Toots*
I am currently unblocking a toilet.

This is why you follow me people!
@SAJ_Toots *switches to throwing marshmallows @PyramidHead76*
@Furryous1 @PyramidHead76 I feel I am winning many battles at the moment.

*bathes in warm glow*
@Furryous1 @PyramidHead76 Getting in trouble over terminology again.
In my defence it says on website "The premier amateur theatre company."
@PyramidHead76 @Furryous1 I shall do what I jolly well like!
Have to say from the pics that looks an incredible looking amateur theatre.
@Furryous1 Oh great classic stuff. Well good luck with that and when the time comes remember to break appendages!
@Furryous1 Rehearsal for what then?
Turns out that today is #WorldTheatreDay and of course where shall I not be going.

Typical!
@SAJ_Toots Walked miles but no running until year half ago when started weekly parkrun. Have knocked nine minutes off my first 5K time.
@SAJ_Toots Well good luck with that. I am normally at deaths door at the end of my 5K. I am not sure I could do two of them.
@virginmedia Yes, this was my thinking as well. Two deaths of the Motorola in three months means that I am happy to be shot of it anyway.
@LydiaRoseBlagg @TreCurran Yep, that was were I got the last two. Saved over £80 on two shows in one day on face value.
@LydiaRoseBlagg @TreCurran As long as its not a sell out show, you can get massive deals I have since found.
@LydiaRoseBlagg @TreCurran Madness! Worth remembering the online sites though. I sat in a comfy £60 seat for £20 a few months back.
@TreCurran Never a truer word said. A false ecomony in every sense. Are you sure you meant £160 @LydiaRoseBlagg? :O This is just sick.
@virginmedia ... contract upgrade. Was just interested in them sending a different phone and your thoughts really.
@virginmedia No haven't contacted as if they are happy to send, I am happy with alternative. Seems better phone and only month before...
@SAJ_Toots Once you pop you can't stop!
@RoyalDerngate @SarahMillican75 Hit it with a stick!
@virginmedia Sent a Motorola Razr i and got a LG G3 s back.
They knew they were sending a different one as charger and battery were sent.
@SAJ_Toots I have absolutely no idea what this means...
@chrispoppe If there's one thing my Irish friends taught me, is we are all entitled. You also give good justice to why you didn't enjoy.
I don't quite agree with previous retweet review (my own more glowing will come), however I learnt recently we all have a right to opinion!
@pinkladyapril Yes they are great. I just hope that the idiots out there leave them alone.
@mudbeast76 
@virginmedia Phone sent back Tuesday, replacement received today. Interestingly a different model, but a good upgrade. Was surprised though.
Northampton Knights. Taken earlier and not "now"... 
@SAJ_Toots I think it was the moment they caught me changing them that swung it.
@PyramidHead76 *glares*
This is not "now". This is earlier, and forever.
@SAJ_Toots They told me to take my underpants and get out when they found me asleep under the stairs.
Lovely view out the door of the Royal now... 
@pinkladyapril Not sure I can! Help!!!

Our Town is the next on my list.
I have a whole 12 days before my next theatre trip.

I feel quite poorly.
@RoyalDerngate @ErrolFlynnFilm Certainly, in my season ticket, don't you know. ;)
My first encounter with Mr Miller. I am learning fast.
@amarab04 I am sure someone with your acting skills will make it work.
@amarab04 It's worth pretending you are hyperventilating or some such to make someone guilty enough to take you.
@amarab04 It is (this doesn't make it better).
Demand someone take you on Saturday!
@RoyalDerngate @ErrolFlynnFilm Thanks for opportunity to see 2 cracking shows today. See you in two weeks for Cyrano. Going to be long wait!
@amarab04 I am truly sad for you as it quite brilliant. :(
@mudbeast76 @theEricaM @forestholidays I hope you have some marmalade sandwiches for him.
@amarab04 ARRRGH! :(
@theEricaM @mudbeast76 @forestholidays Guessing Forest of Dean then?
@chrispoppe @curiousonstage @RoyalDerngate Not that I understood it of course. I just looked at the pretty lights. ;)
@chrispoppe @curiousonstage @RoyalDerngate Just incredible! That three minute snippet at the end was better than some shows on its own.
Well @curiousonstage is really rather superb. Lived up to the anticipation.
On @RoyalDerngate until Saturday. I suggest you go.
@RDYouthTheatre It is quite brilliant!

@PandaHQSky @PyramidHead76 WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT! Don't say such things about my Penelope!
@PyramidHead76 *I

*sigh*
@PyramidHead76 My had a real relationship with Penelope Pitstop.
@PyramidHead76 ... when I were a lad...
@theEricaM They look delightful. The simple holiday. Enjoy!
@chrispoppe Well you enjoy your evening then!
@amarab04 I wouldn't go near the bed anyway, I am sure there is something under it.
@amarab04 What's that behind you?
@spunshon @chrispoppe I should have told him to go home at the interval Sarah, he wouldn't have been entitled to write a review then. ;)
@chrispoppe I am sure not. The first thing I have to do is fight this cold off to enjoy it. Seeing A View From The Bridge in the evening!
@chrispoppe It went down with the pensioners trip out I was trapped in this afternoon as well.
@chrispoppe Tomorrow afternoon I shall be seeing this one. It has great pressure to be exceptional!
@chrispoppe Well you are clearly wrong and not entitled to your opinion! ;) :P

Seriously sorry it didn't work for you though.
@spunshon @chrispoppe Everybody is different don't you know! :O
@chrispoppe Astounded! We are having an interesting difference of opinion week. ;)
@chrispoppe Well, difficult to know what to say. Thought it was just more of the same fun. So, I myself would never not watch a second half.
@chrispoppe Yes this afternoon. Thought it was fabulous.
@brackleyhippy Someone you don't need to care about and certainly not have to pray for him.
@TMLLaw Seeing it tomorrow. Have to say anticipation is ridiculously high on this one.
@chrispoppe Are you getting to see The Secret Adversary?
Hey just thought of a great joke. Jeremy Clarkson could join #OneDirection!

Bet no one has tweeted that one...
@theEricaM Yes, it will be interesting to see the morals of the other channels that criticised the BBC over this on their news programmes.
If you quit because your work colleague punches another colleague and gets sacked. Where does that leave your morals or common sense?
Absolutely brilliant @SAdversary @RoyalDerngate! Fun, frivolous and inventive. You have just three more chances to catch in Northampton. GO!
I have a matinee this afternoon @RoyalDerngate to see the @SAdversary 

@callum_jones22 I wonder that if MPship does fail the long term plan is Jim Harker replacement?
@ITVLaurenHall Great isn't it. I saw it in London sometime back with Suranne Jones in it.
@PandaHQSky I am sure that they don't want to scare the viewers. ;)
@PandaHQSky I shall probably be edited out to protect those with a nervous disposition.
@PandaHQSky The Northampton one of course. I was present within a relatively small crowd in an important section, so maybe...
@amarab04 Pick a card! Any card...
@PandaHQSky I might be visible in a crowd in a later episode of the series...
@ChronandEcho I am tremendously sorry for being negative again, but I believe the Mayor used to do these opening roles.
@spunshon @danielbye @RoyalDerngate They are also tremendous pies also.
Welcome back also!
Seems @adamsoffice felt his profile was a bit low, so in a week has managed to muscle into a couple of stories he perhaps didn't need to.
@virginmedia Thanks! I am now counting the days to end of April and contract end where I can get a new phone now. Ready for upgrade now.
@virginmedia On the plus side, I got the broadband speed increase and a price reduction after popping in shop to see when mobile contract up
@virginmedia Same fault as start of January, a boot loop which doesn't get past the Motorola/Intel splash screen. Maybe an inherent fault?
I am missing my musical theatre friends from Ireland.

I didn't want a capitulation. I wanted a battle!
So second time in three months I have a @virginmedia Phambulance.
Motorola's are not quite built to last it seems... 
@LydiaRoseBlagg *climbs out bathroom window*
@LydiaRoseBlagg SHAN'T!
I miss the thrill of dial-up if I am honest &gt; Check out my @Ookla Speedtest @virginmedia result! 
@andrewdavies251 Yes, I might have been getting at that. ;)
Although I haven't yet won a million on National Lottery once or a second time. I wish to make it clear I do not intend to win a third time.
@helenchick91 Ugh...
@PandaHQSky I might try to fake my death then.
@PandaHQSky Bless you my child.
My coffin will lay in ropose (whatever that means) for a week, and I hope as many of you may queue up to see me as possible.
I don't like to be over dramatic, but Twitter I am that ill I may not make it through the night.
@tonyclarkeuk @Politics_NN @davidmackintosh At least it will prevent anyone ram raiding @RoyalDerngate...
@butchandriley @davidmackintosh I am sure that it might be used as such at some point.
@chrispoppe Good job! Loved and read all the books. Not sure what to think of a musical of it though.
@chrispoppe CHICKEN! ;)
I hope woodbines were mentioned in speech, if not hopefully in song.
My review of @RDYouthTheatre School Shorts - Act One performed @RoyalDerngate and directed by @aelbourne1 

.@davidmackintosh: "Hey mister, you really have a problem with touching my fings innit!" 
@blabers IT'S HUMONGOUS! Enjoy your night.
"We have a Code Violation 100: NO HELMET.
Please have this man to my right taken outside and shot immediately." 
"NO! I REFUSE TO TOUCH THE PIECE OF PAPER! NO! I WON'T!"
"Aww, go on! Join in, you know you want to!"
"NO!!" 
@BBCNorthampton @callum_jones22 @amy_woodfield I suggest a "Doggedy Poo! Doggedy Poo! Poo! Poo!" jingle to the Blankety Blank theme.
@Grifster96 Happy birthday old person.
@littleknits88 Your postbox was looking delightfully clear of rubbish today.

I am sure it won't last...
@chrispoppe @masutherland I'm keeping out of it.

Although it looks more than big enough for us all to get in.
@chrispoppe @masutherland The one further up at least is in space, but the Royal one, well, I need to be careful what I say...
@Politics_NN @RoyalDerngate @davidmackintosh Yes and the most narrow part of the path there as well. Disappointing as much as anything.
@Politics_NN @RoyalDerngate I genuinely liked what they had done in Guildhall, then they dug it, then this. A good idea wrecked.

My review of Royal &amp; Derngate Youth Theatre School Shorts - Act Two and directed by Ashley Elbourne.

@WillyGilder Maybe they could be seen to promote an item direct to someone? Do sales staff not "offer to help" during this time as well?
@mudbeast76 @aelbourne1 Sending tweets like I did make me feel old.

When I were a lad...
@AJairwaves Well although you never appeared regular on Anglia, I still miss you on screen.
Main thing is to be happy, and you sure look so!
@aelbourne1 The mind boggles! However they do tell us that children group up faster than they used to.
My review of Into The Breach by Mark Carey performed at the Looking Glass Theatre, Northampton

@ChronAliceDyer Yes, mindless individuals destroying our true town jewel. I hope NBC are able to sort it out soon.
@ChronAliceDyer @NorthamptonBC Very sad to see. :(
@SAJ_Toots Oh, that's ok. Not a problem...

@AJairwaves With or without you are looking great Andrea! Oz is obviously good for you.
@HenryShields I am tearing pages out and eating them as I tweet!
@62drapes Thank you! Also silence so far from our friends. Maybe I have shushed them.
@HenryShields follow me or you shall never see that ledger again!
@chrispoppe I understand that there are some parents seeking an injunction on a certain website though... ;)
@chrispoppe No one shall silence me! :)
I have two shows from today to review in the morning already.
Theatre blog post: The Eligibility Of Criticism:

Superb evening @LGTheatre seeing Into The Breach by Mark Carey, marred only by lack of marshmallows.
@Judgys The excuses are endless!
(Enjoy)
We then just spend half hour tweeting ". " back and forth to each other.
The fun we could have!
My Twitter ambition is to get into a conversation that involves so many people in it that it leaves no room to tweet a message.
@chrispoppe Er, good luck with you evil person. :)
@brackleyhippy @nosylocaljourno You rant every time and name them. Only way to rid us of the pillocks.
@treecalculus @angel_sop @blabers From what I have seen though it was handled well considering 1000+ people probably involved.
@PandaHQSky Let that be a lesson to you.
@PandaHQSky *SMACK*
@PandaHQSky *rubs hands*
@angel_sop @blabers Well many things go wrong, but yes one character spends some time in a wheelchair. :)
@angel_sop @blabers Ouch! :O
Did you see Peter Pan Goes Wrong? ;)
@angel_sop @blabers Hope it didn't spoil the shows too much for them.
Must be tricky dealing with show interruptions.
@angel_sop @blabers Oh. Must have been second half as I was in Underground during the first.
@PandaHQSky Bend over young lady!
@PandaHQSky Most certainly! ;)
@PandaHQSky If you don't do what you are told, I am going to smack your bottom!
@PandaHQSky yes
@amarab04 If I not careful you might have to open the double doors at R&amp;D to get you head through though. :P
@amarab04 @harryfmason It's no Sweeney in my humble opinion, but I hope you enjoy it.
@PandaHQSky Go to sleep!
@chrispoppe Well if your well written, well researched, knowledgeable blog has got you in trouble, there is no hope for any of us.
@blabers Understudy Jesus on today. Good job you went last night.
@mudbeast76 :D See you in a few minutes maybe Mr Jim.
Theatre today (which I will review, so there!) consists of @RDYouthTheatre School Shorts &amp; Into The Breach @LGTheatre 
@mudbeast76 Thank you Mr Holden!
@mudbeast76 I shall be grilling you on JCS this evening and if you disagree with me, you are clearly wrong...
;)
@angel_sop @MTIreland Thank you Angela. Pleased don't say anymore praise though, or you might bias me towards your next performance. ;)
My thoughts on eligibility to review theatre and what I now call @MTIreland-gate.

@SAJ_Toots Oh, did I DM you that picture by mistake? That was meant for someone else entirely...
@kardisom ..., can make a change. Depends on what day as well you are looking at. Duston Mill is generally the only Sat one, Sunday loads.
@kardisom Well all starting up now and lots of options. I would say avoid Sixfields football one as gets frantic. Maybe try a village one...
@PandaHQSky and there I was about to be all serious on my blog! I feel quite distracted now.
@Judgys or like a certain person to a parkrun...
*cracks whip*
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots In what way is an image like that going to help? I don't think I will be able to sleep tonight now either.
@kardisom Car boot time is here! :)
I am...
*drumroll*
Standing in a field!
.@MTIreland @mudbeast76 Interesting reply, but can you answer the question? If I had written "rock opera" would you have contacted me?
@SAJ_Toots Come stand in a field!
Far too early...
@PandaHQSky Such a gracious offer would never be declined, had I not got to get up at an ungodly hour.
Keep it warm for next time...
@PandaHQSky Go to sleep!
@SAJ_Toots Having trouble with your keyboard again?
Here have this "o" and "c".
@NTFC_fan My father used to swim there, but it went before I was about.
Shame you were not able to be there Sunday.
@NTFC_fan We were outside the old road tax building. Were you @NorthamptonBus demolition Sunday?
@AlicePiper1 Bear grills must need awfully big kitchens.
@mudbeast76 @aelbourne1 Watchit mister! ;)
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Tea stained clothes are all the rage.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Live dangerously Sir!
@SAJ_Toots I am sure @PyramidHead76 has learned it. I have heard the rumours...
@blabers Ushers cry: RESTRAIN THAT WOMAN! We have a code 1: Person on stage!
@blabers Leaning on the balcony again!
Enjoy your evening.
@SAJ_Toots I have missed making them. It has been loooooong winter!
@blabers Your fireworks location of Duston Mill.
15 hours until I shall be "standing in a field" for the first time this year.

I live for these moments!
@chrispoppe Yes. I did see that from your review. Quite ironic that the understudy was also, let's say (consults lawyers), not the best.
@DaveHearn2 Very sadly confirmed as a fake. :(
@mudbeast76 I felt the positioning of the clouds was tremendously shoddy. Sack the choreographer I say!
Solar eclipse from Northampton - Friday 20th 2015: 
@joederrington A little picture I happened to see last night... 
Let me introduce the Goodfellas Pizza #eclipse2015 pinhole device! 
.@MTIreland @mudbeast76 ... way in to reply, would you have still contacted me?
.@MTIreland @mudbeast76 I feel slight semantics over rock opera/musical. If I had written rock opera in the review and not given you the...
@chrispoppe ... I had most problem with didn't perform your night. I did however mention no names in my criticism.
@chrispoppe ... version yesterday on YouTube and actually liked it. So now I lean more to the production being the problem. I know the one..
@chrispoppe Yes and the first slightly critical one I write and I get this. I didn't think it was dated actually and listened to another...
@theEricaM Yes sad to wake to it this morning. :(
@mudbeast76 Bleets like a goat, but looks uncannily like a bear.
@KathrinaPerry @NorthamptonBus I sat and took it all in at 22 months...
@mudbeast76 @MTIreland Thanks Jim, I'm learning! ;)
Musical for me was a story told through music. Hence I called it such. Live and learn!
@mudbeast76 @MTIreland Yes, I have seen it called this. Can it not also be a musical though? Seen it listed as musical and rock musical.
Any thoughts on this my followers? &gt; RT @MTIreland: @asmallmind JCS is not a musical. It's a rock opera
@theEricaM Beware them Ice Warriors though!
So #NorthantsHour who in Northampton was present for both @NorthamptonBus demolition and these ones in 1979? 
@PandaHQSky It is rather fun and silly!

@Judgys *stares*
@PandaHQSky That is indeed random Grace. But nice.
@helenchick91 Don't worry. It's just distressing to see these things that you were there at the start become soooo old! :)
@helenchick91 This news makes me feel old. :(
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 Well there you go then. We are all indeed different with our opinions.
I am right and you are clearly wrong! :P ;)
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 Well I had one cracker with The Mikado this week, so I don't call it a bad week.
@chrispoppe @mudbeast76 Don't you worry about me. I am almost grateful to have found a disappointment really. :) Had to happen!
My review of Kissing Sid James performed at the Playhouse Theatre, Northampton:

@angel_sop Just didn't work for me at all. Lovely spectacle though. Review tomorrow will be fun! ;)
@callum_jones22 Yes, I think you are most certainly correct. I called it a work in progress of a partnership earlier.
@mudbeast76 @chrispoppe Yes not for me that one. I will have fun writing a review tomorrow though. I WILL write one despite everything. :)
@mudbeast76 @RoyalDerngate Fine production and well performed, just not my music at all. If you like the show, I am sure you will be fine.
@blabers There was however a rather nice apostle lady. :)
Also happy to report that Jesus was looking well for you Friday.
@blabers Sad to report that I lean towards the @Grifster96 opinion on this one. Amazing staging though.
Had to happen, but best part of 13 months and over 60 shows, I returned disappointed from @RoyalDerngate today.
Happy with that strike rate.
@DJB1306 I sadly can't remember it being only two. However I claim a presence.
@mudbeast76 It OK! I wasn't anywhere near there, I was the opposite side.
@toosurreal A novel idea, but I am very much alive.
I am in a Derngate box for first time in 22 years and I have it to myself!
I am @RoyalDerngate watching Jesus Christ Superstar.

I would be grateful if all these things that I was there at the start can stop being so old.

Damn you #Neighbours30thAnniversary
So I wonder who in Northampton was present for both @NorthamptonBus demolition and these ones in 1979? 
@AntoniaU94 No apologies necessary. I saw from the production that you are not as quick as you were... ;)
Thank you for a great show!
My review of Kissing Sid James performed by the Playhouse Theatre, Northampton:

@CharBurtLX @RDYouthTheatre BOGOF!
@chrispoppe In my defense I was in a pushchair. I couldn't possibly be to blame...
@chrispoppe Could it happen to someone twice? 
@chrispoppe Ah yes, there was a slight accident with a few little explosives. Sincere apologies!

@amarab04 Well yes, I realised after I sent it that I might potentially have been insulting my own age bracket.
I take any slur back. :)
@theEricaM I thought that you didn't qiite sound right, and more importantly didn't know who I am! ;)
I take any suggested blame back!
@SAJ_Toots Quite, erm, interesting...
My review of The Mikado by the Northampton Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Group @RoyalDerngate:


@amarab04 Oh dear, old people and tech...
@SAJ_Toots Thank you! Everyone is safe with me in charge.
*slaps @PyramidHead76 again*
@chrispoppe Well that doesn't sound too bad does it!
I can report that we had no snow.
@SAJ_Toots Have a good time. I shall behave.

*slaps @PyramidHead76*
@chrispoppe I say back, purely because you appeared missing, not that I knew had gone anywhere. :)
All is well with myself, seen many plays!
@chrispoppe Your back!
Think I shall be seeing this tomorrow.
@Judgys *stares* ;)
I am currently watching Kissing Sid James at the Playhouse Theatre. Runs until Saturday.

@theEricaM Was that you on my phone earlier? If so, how dare you cancel my performance! ;)
@angel_sop Getting out of control!
@angel_sop School Shorts! ;)
I have an ever increasing theatre schedule!
Off to Playhouse tonight as well!
@angel_sop Thank you, and no doubt I am. Seem to converting to everything. :)
I am even trying to work out if I can go and see it again.
@Grifster96 @Elinor_M_Cross But is Elinor cross?
@HeadcaseTheatre @mudbeast76 @FlashTheatre15 Is it a hat?
@HeadcaseTheatre @mudbeast76 @FlashTheatre15 It better be a rabbit!
@blabers That is so right.
Also by the sounds of it, the whole cast will be understudies by tomorrow.
I hope your actor is OK Friday. :)
@blabers I might pop to see it tomorrow all being well. I hate a mystery. I need to know who of you is right.
@blabers Are you paying?
If so! It must be really good! ;)
@MrsChunkstar Indeed. I hope the rest of the week goes well.
@MrsChunkstar Oh exciting! I don't think I have ever been hung up in a green room before. :D
@Grifster96 @blabers Oh, OK, and there I was going to suggest a fight.
@blabers @Grifster96 I think there is only one way to solve this Jesus situation!
My review of The Mikado by the Northampton Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Group performed @RoyalDerngate:

@mudbeast76 @RDYouthTheatre "Whistle while you work, A Small Mind is a twerp. He's half barmy..."
@RDYouthTheatre @mudbeast76 SOUNDS LIKE A TRAP JIM! DON'T TELL 'EM!
I am coming the two weekend afternoons.

Oh, stupid boy...
@RDYouthTheatre I don't like crowded spaces...
@blabers Get them on my tablet now when I click a link that I can't even remove. Sure adverts pay, but it's ridiculous sometimes.
@MrsChunkstar If only you hadn't them select problem people in the crowd. Thankfully it didn't upset the performers.
@RoyalDerngate Thank you to the ushers who helped deal with the recorder tonight in The Mikado.
@angel_sop I don't think anyone should think that tonight.
It was probably "pass the boiled sweets love!" or "my teeth have fell out!" ;)
@angel_sop Yes, I think that was only problem in the second half. I think it was an older lady who didn't know how loud she was whispering!
@MrsChunkstar Yes most certainly did enjoy it. Expect a glowing review sometime tomorrow on my blog.
@angel_sop The problem now though is my secret is being kept safe with a lot of people! ;)
@angel_sop I don't think they made it as spoke to an usher who said the kids hadn't arrived. Didn't sound like kids either.
@mudbeast76 @RoyalDerngate Much less in the second half, and the film man was dealt with at the interval by the ushers.
Superb show though.
@beadjoux @BA_Actors Yes great play. Quite a bit different from the film though for those familiar with that.
@angel_sop Ah yes. I may have exposed myself a little there... ;)
Worse examples of theatre goers tonight. Talking during overture.
Eating what sounds like crisps in circle.
And filming and taking photos.

The best video available of @NorthamptonBus demise:
GREYFRIARS BUS STATION: 
@RoyalDerngate Oddly I have now been told by G&amp;S group on Facebook that it starts at 7pm.
I like a mystery! :)
@RoyalDerngate Ok. Thank you. Facebook false info! :)
@ldeeexox My pleasure, it was wonderful.
Have a saucer of milk! 
@RoyalDerngate Is it correct there is a pre show talk before The Mikado tonight? If there is, what time is it?

@WildeV @ChronandEcho @NorthamptonBC @IanPaulRock Lovely...
Well if its empty, can we call @DSMDemolition back while they in town?
@WildeV @ChronandEcho @NorthamptonBC @IanPaulRock It was interesting after blowing one "ugly building" up to reveal two equally so behind it
@Politics_NN I am sure there may have been traffic regulations broken. Maybe @ChronandEcho, @NorthamptonUK or @BBCNorthampton could check?
@Politics_NN @davidmackintosh Problem I have is who authorised Abington St to be reopened yesterday. Seen no mention in media.
@SAJ_Toots It was splendid indeed! Try to enjoy 3am, if that is possible.
@SAJ_Toots Night Sally!
@NorthamptonBus @callum_jones22 DO IT!
@WildeV Hehe! Yes loved we got the equivalent "and finally" piece.
@ChronandEcho Why was Abington Srreet open this afternoon then @NorthamptonBC? It was dangerous with cars going both ways.
@mudbeast76 @catgarlick It has been my pleasure indeed.
You're a star!
@NorthamptonBus It's been a blast. We shall all miss you.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots The magic moment of correcting an incorrection with an incorrection.

Only silly people would do that...
I hope you have all made the most of Mothering Sunday

Celebrate it while you can as you can never be sure when it might be the last.
@Ms_Malaprop Aww just seen. Sad news. I wish you well.
@MrSteveBanks @LydiaRoseBlagg @JamieTPark 
@mudbeast76 @LydiaRoseBlagg @MrSteveBanks @JamieTPark Uni version of Treasure Island and they won't be able to keep you off the stage.
@mudbeast76 @BA_Actors Thank you! Shall read all your asap.
My other two are currently lost in transit. ;) Hopefully done tomorrow!
@NorthamptonBus Did you carry one of these? We could implant your broken escalator into another building. 
@NorthamptonBus "Oh Bobby! Tell me it was all a dream. Tell me it ain't so!" 
The tiny machines peck and rip at the sorry corpse of @NorthamptonBus 
@NorthamptonBus Beyond the temporary loos of Victoria Street lies the temporary clock still tick tocking. 
Love the reverse! @NorthamptonBus REBORN!
Greyfriars bus station demolition in slow motion: 
@NorthamptonBC Can't help but feel two way Abington St is rather dangerous. Maybe should have waited until Greyfriars was open again?
@NickBieberHP @chaterfranks @nosylocaljourno Oh lovely, yes let's watch @NorthamptonBus and his violent and graphic death in slow motion.
@nosylocaljourno @chaterfranks @NickBieberHP Well YouTube have done a good job stabilising it anyway. I was nervous for pigeons thats all...
@chaterfranks @NickBieberHP The lurching of my video indeed suggests a little jump. However of course I did not at all. No not at all...
@BrettMcMaster Oh I agree it's right now. The damage was done in the years before.
@BrettMcMaster More like 40 years neglecting really though.

@BA_Actors Thank you for three superb shows. Crackers all three of them
Now very ready for @FlashTheatre15
@amarab04 It all comes from that Sweeney timehop. It's a curse!
@amarab04 @RDYouthTheatre Feed the mystery! It's much more interesting than the reality. :)
@amarab04 "Hey @RDYouthTheatre is @asmallmind sitting in front of you?"
As if...
@RoyalDerngate @pieminister I settled on the Heidi in the end and it was gorgeous! 
Today I'm seeing @BA_Actors A Clockwork Orange &amp; Dying For It back to back @RoyalDerngate.
A good day in the theatre. 
@RoyalDerngate @pieminister Although not a vegi, I think that Heidi looks very appealing. Can't go wrong with goat's cheese.
@RoyalDerngate @pieminister I am actually having my first one today. Which do you recommend? I am spoilt for choice.
Today consists of one @Northampparkrun and two @RoyalDerngate plays.

This is good.
@LucyCaldwell3 @NorthamptonBus They are not releasing a time as "this is not a public event", however the best guess I have seen is 9:30.
Paid a final visit to see @NorthamptonBus today. 
@SAJ_Toots Good night Sally! Hope you sleep through the whole night tonight.
@WildeV @BA_Actors I am not there tonight, but the audience was younger than the performers this morning.
I blame bald patch and grey hair!

@LydiaRoseBlagg Not a problem. I am ready for May now! :)
@MrSteveBanks @BA_Actors I wouldn't have dared give a bad review. I am still quite frightened by you even now.
While watching @BA_Actors today, the lady next to me asked if I was the parent of one of the performers.

Never have I felt so old...
My review of The Last Days Of Judas Iscariot performed by @BA_Actors @RoyalDerngate:

@Judgys I think you are trying far too hard to avoid the parkrun.
@Judgys Are you trying to get out of the parkrun again by going places?
@richardosman Can I say maybe?
@LydiaRoseBlagg It was great (review preview comment)! I just need to get it done today before my double bill tomorrow! Be right back...

@WildeV Have you read/remembered my recommendation of a Robert Goddard yet?
@WildeV Yes, wondered whether it was a Christmas shop at first. Looks like they are staying now though. Dangerous shop for you though! :D
@WildeV It's nice having a @TheWorksStores back in town. Hope they hang around this time.
@RDYouthTheatre Do we know which of the Connections plays this year will be performed at R&amp;D?
@Grifster96 Yet! :D Not that I am a fan of it anyway, and certainly not Mr Thicke.
@Grifster96 Is this the only version you are allowed to play now? ;)
Main thing I hope with this #TopGear controversy is that @JeremyClarkson is available to film the regeneration scene if he doesn't return.
The latest profile publicity photos of @NorthamptonBC leader @davidmackintosh have been released. 
My dinner was late today.

However other than the few speckles of blood on it, it looks quite nice now its arrived.
@RDYouthTheatre The research manual has arrived! 
@TheChrisBurdett @BA_Actors @RoyalDerngate Seconded! Good luck all.

@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Times like this I am grateful of the rise of smartphones. Cleaning between them keys used to be tricky.
@WillyGilder Well at least they give it a try.
Bless...
The only way this day could get better is if there's an unexpected meeting between Jeremy Clarkson and Robin Thicke in a dark alley.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy...

#RobinThicke
Amazing film about seventies Northampton!

Talking Collections: Good Morning Northampton! (bonus feature): 
@blabers Fracas sounds educated, scuffle sounds common.
@NorthamptonBC 13...
@NorthamptonBC 12...
@f8andbethere Does this make me an official photographer? ;)
@f8andbethere My attempt! 
@callum_jones22 I think I agree that you are only asking for trouble nowadays. I feel sorry for people who need to though for work.
Today @NorthamptonBC have posted ten photos of @davidmackintosh posing at different locations. Is this what official council feed should do?
@NorthamptonBC @littleknits88 Its good the issue being raised again, but you really need to find a solution to this in the long term,
@SAJ_Toots We would never do that!!!

I believe dunking in the pond would be more appropriate. ;)
@SAJ_Toots I think I am happy that they don't to be honest.
@SAJ_Toots Do your middle toes go down to the end of them shoes?

(Chatting to a lady technique in action again)
@SAJ_Toots *sneakers
@WildeV Eek! Not even the kettle treatment can shift it?
@littleknits88 @NorthamptonBC Indeed. I forgot to post my picture I snapped on Saturday. 
First photo on board at St Edmunds last year.
Second photo: New plans revealed suddenly on public meeting day.
Odd? 
It is disturbing to see how an official council Twitter feed like @NorthamptonBC really just becomes a propaganda election feed at this time
@WildeV No I am with you on this one.
Also get rid of that X red sticker as well, it is disturbing.
@RiggerTheGeek @graceHQsky *buzz* Use of incorrect grammar.
@graceHQsky @RiggerTheGeek *buzz*
Repetition of "I"!
*stretches rules*
@graceHQsky @RiggerTheGeek Correct interruption. You have 140 characters remaining, subject is: Pickled eggs
@graceHQsky @RiggerTheGeek What was the subject matter?
@RiggerTheGeek Chair offers benefit of the doubt and allows you to continue.
@RiggerTheGeek *buzz* That looks like a hesitation after "Welcome" there.
@WillyGilder @Politics_NN I think maybe a tad suspicious plans coming forward day of public meeting and similar to boards erected months ago
@mudbeast76 @RDYouthTheatre This now gives me no excuse to be "unavailable" then doesn't it?
@mudbeast76 @RDYouthTheatre Oh you do have some then. I thought chicken? ;)
My review of NMPAT A Wind Band Spectacular at Royal &amp; Derngate:

@mudbeast76 @RDYouthTheatre But are we brave enough to make kontact?
@blabers Bowly one half successful, still booking to sort out.
Edmunds very suspect still to me. Believe it when I see something concrete.
@blabers This is not good. You really should have been somewhere else shouldn't you!
@BrettMcMaster I survived!
Of to two council meetings.

I can't really contain my excitement to be honest...
My review of @NMPATrust A Wind Band Spectacular @RoyalDerngate, featuring @jemlouflo 

Goes without saying that @playgoeswrong would be nominated for @OlivierAwards.
I would have marched on London and climbed Parliament if not.
That moment of unbearable excitement at seeing a game like this exists...

@jemlouflo @NMPATrust All deserved. Good luck in the future endeavours.
Have the pleasure of not one, but two meetings at Northampton Guildhall today.

Mondays are made for such excitement as this...
Special performance @jemlouflo tonight for @NMPATrust Wind Band Spectacular. Truly incredible and worthy of that there standing ovation!
@LydiaRoseBlagg @mudbeast76 You are doing that replying before I send the message again. I am sure of it.
@LydiaRoseBlagg @mudbeast76 Just star struck...
@LydiaRoseBlagg That's nothing! I was briefly in the presence this evening of this guy! 
@LydiaRoseBlagg Not the BOOMING Jim Carter!!!

A quite impossible voice.
@LydiaRoseBlagg @Absolute80s Now you tell me after retweeting!
I dunt want spelling errors on my time line!
@LydiaRoseBlagg @Absolute80s I was going to add that but wasn't educated enuff to spell it.
Hot dog! Jumping frog!
@Absolute80s
Topped up my theatre ticket box with @theNMTC's A Slice Of Variety this evening.

My review of #RDHacktivists by Ben Ockrent performed by Royal and Derngate Youth Theatre directed by Ashley Elbourne.

@beadjoux Yes did worry about them. There is so much clutter to deal with as it is.

@SAJ_Toots I bank at Barclays! :O
@Grifster96 As requested Mr Griff!

Tonight I am @RoyalDerngate for @NMPATrust Wind Band Spectacular.

@mudbeast76 Part of my GCSE coursework in them ancient days before this Internet thingy. We are all old indeed!
@mudbeast76 I blogged what I think was my first ever review the other day for World Book Day. Some 22 years ago.

@aelbourne1 Well, I am afraid that didn't work. I was surprised to find that it would seem they don't stock any of the Connections books.
@mudbeast76 Hopefully for the better! ;)
I did re-read a few of the early ones recently and they were very lightweight, so trying to improve
@aelbourne1 Well you little show didn't disappoint either and with all this grading threat, I thought I better try a bit! ;)
@mudbeast76 *blushes*
My review of #RDHacktivists by Ben Ockrent performed by @RDYouthTheatre @RoyalDerngate and directed by @aelbourne1 

@Lord_Monteagle We would doubt be told "they offer a distinctive and clear border between the walking space and the driving space".
I see the Pillars Of Mackintosh have finally arrived in Northampton. 
@RDYouthTheatre Well this is good for me, hope it is for you @mudbeast76!
@RDYouthTheatre Afternoon or evening? (please say evening!)
I am in a library.
On a Sunday.
Double radical.
@NorthamptonBus @ChronandEcho or an official pardon from @Queen_UK.
@SAJ_Toots Good night ma'am. You rest your feeties!
@graceHQsky @PyramidHead76 *sobs*
@graceHQsky @PyramidHead76 Stay calm Grace, I am only yanking your (missing) power cord! ;)
@graceHQsky @PyramidHead76 WORMS!
Oh no! Sayonara!
@RDYouthTheatre @Emzular @DramaQueenBex Where can I get my money back?
;)
@graceHQsky @PyramidHead76 Dig for victory into that cupboard!
@graceHQsky @PyramidHead76 You found the better machine.
@Judgys I did my 5k this morning! :P

I shall expect your Parkrun presence next week then.
@graceHQsky @PyramidHead76 I never had a 600, just either side but Whoop!
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Eek! Please be careful!
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Hope it wasn't a big, potentially drowning bath again.
@SAJ_Toots Wondered what that whiff was.

I'm da man when it comes to talking to ladies aint I!
@mudbeast76 (I can't write until tomorrow anyway ;) )
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots You're a let down once again.
@mudbeast76 Its the quality they are after though. I don't want a D- again, had enough of them at school.
@PyramidHead76 Much better. Where is @SAJ_Toots panda though?
@mudbeast76 That was quick!
They shall have to wait for mine until tomorrow, I have too much pressure to get it right.
#grading
It was great!
If you are in Northampton and have a spare hour tonight, go see the witty and sharp #RDHacktivists by @RDYouthTheatre

@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots I saw the others, but the bottoms were more dominant and in my face.
As it were...
@SAJ_Toots Certainly, I have pressure on this particular one.
It won't be until tomorrow though.
@SAJ_Toots I did. It was a lovely little short one today. Witty and fun.
@PyramidHead76 Nice to see it hasn't changed since I went with my middle school.
Although I suppose that would defeat the object...
@blabers It'll snow! 
#sodslaw
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Crumps the man if you want a picture of a ducks ars... erm, bottom.
@RDYouthTheatre I was!
@RDYouthTheatre The malfunctioning brain is here demanding to be entertained.
@SAJ_Toots Need to go sit in theatre for hour or so.
Today I am @RoyalDerngate for @RDYouthTheatre performance of #RDHacktivists

I really didn't need to see a picture of me doing the Parkrun this morning.

Oh no...

@Kitty1601 @Politics_NN I have a strange conflict of wanting him to become an MP and also not. I really would love to see how he handles it.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 I would have been happier if he had gone as Mellors myself.
@Grifster96 @RDYouthTheatre I have to admit I am feeling quite a bit of pressure over this particular review.
@Kitty1601 @Politics_NN @davidmackintosh I think more are blocked than unblocked. The skin is very tender it would seem.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 :O

I have nothing to add!
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Only book she had read probably...

#JudgementalMoi
@RDYouthTheatre @Grifster96 Not sure if this is good or bad news?
I might not have been able to cope with sitting near such celebrity!
@Politics_NN @ChronandEcho @davidmackintosh No matter what is said about costs, there is a certain waste of materials going on.
@beadjoux Yes much better news to wake to this morning. :)
I have been rebellious and not read a book during #WorldBookDay
However unlike many who have today, I shall read all the other days.
@SAJ_Toots I really love Blackpool!
@KazShakespeare Thank you very much Karen. That is really appreciated. :D

Notes From A Small Mind: #WorldBookDay: My First Book Review 

#WorldBookDay 
@ArteNicholas I was going to reply to this tweet with something meaningful, but I just can't be bothered...
@playgoeswrong WHOOP!
What do I win?
@ChronandEcho @Politics_NN @davidmackintosh Well it will be nice to something,  so thank you.
It's a shame that you didn't make printed copy
@DavidPalethorpe You very well know that money is ring fenced for the museum and couldn't possibly be used for anything else...
@Politics_NN @davidmackintosh This really is an absolute joke. Still not seen a @ChronandEcho report. Has there been one?
My review of The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas running at Royal &amp; Derngate until Saturday:

@SAJ_Toots Phew...
@SAJ_Toots No not at all, easy to remember.
Not in the fool way of course, but in the memorable day way.

Have I got away with that?
@SAJ_Toots Hang on a minute, April Fools day?
@SAJ_Toots Sadly I tend to forget things that are more than 27 days ahead...
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 "Term of violation of account broken: Rule 63 - Clear and graphic depiction of members bazooka."
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Hacked, that old excuse...
@PyramidHead76 Posting pictures of you weapon again?
@playgoeswrong I shall imagine that it would be Leicester Square.
My review of The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas running @RoyalDerngate until Saturday:

@KathrinaPerry We all know that a butterfly crashing in Abington Park would be to blame if there was an issue at Northgate in Macks mind.
@KathrinaPerry I think you missed my sarcasm there. :D
Twitter didn't leave me enough characters for the ;) at the end.
@KathrinaPerry I agree with @davidmackintosh that there were no roadworks in them 38 years it was open that might have effected Greyfriars..
@KathrinaPerry Yeah, no, right, maybe, yes, no, possibly, yep, it was all waffle really.
@KathrinaPerry @DavidPalethorpe The one day I miss Miss @blabers!
*heads to iplayer*
@KathrinaPerry @DavidPalethorpe When was he on? Sounds like an iplayer jobby! ;)

My review of the Open Mic Story Night at Royal &amp; Derngate.

@amarab04 @FrankieNicole98 Not been to Blackpool for about 25 years, but loved it there in the old days. You enjoy it.
@PyramidHead76 @SAJ_Toots Wasting your time playing games! *sigh*
@amarab04 @FrankieNicole98 I am sure there will be more!
Not sure if they will need the seagull sounds though.
@FrankieNicole98 All I can hear are strange @amarab04 seagull noises now.
Quality production of The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas @RoyalDerngate.
Tough at times to watch, but important story to be told.
@SAJ_Toots :(
On the plus side I now know you can control a touch screen with your tongue.
@SAJ_Toots *licks screen*
Tonight I am @RoyalDerngate for The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas. Runs until Saturday.

My review of the Open Mic Story Night @RoyalDerngate on Saturday 28th February, 2015.

@SAJ_Toots *struts around the room boldly*
I had nothing to spend that £100 on anyway...
@f8andbethere Yes its all done now, again. Hopefully all is correct now.
Fingers are firmly crossed!
@f8andbethere I regret bragging to everyone now about how early I had submitted it. I simply am fuming!
Lesson: Always treble check!
Don't come near me, I might not be responsible for my actions.
#ThatAwkwardMoment when you find out that that super early tax return you sent last July didn't submit correctly.
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 No its OK, I am good.
I don't mind making a complete R's of myself...
@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 I apologise for the error in my last tweet. I have no idea where that R varnished too.
@SAJ_Toots My nail vanish is that colour as well!

Just overheard someone asking directions to @RoyalDerngate.

Thankful that they didn't ask me, I wouldn't have a clue...

@SAJ_Toots @PyramidHead76 Yes it's a shame. :(
In comparison here is a picture of my weapon. 
@WildeV If only it was the same price as "normal" cheese I would happily sit eating it all day. We need to convert world to get it cheaper!
@WildeV Mmmm goats cheese...
@SAJ_Toots Hey Sally! Look at the size of @PyramidHead76's weapon! 
@PyramidHead76 Well done! I see you didn't take a pea shooter with you either.
@PyramidHead76 You still not finished that yet?
@ChronandEcho @Tallestpurpl @Politics_NN It has been rather obvious in a central high street over a week so I would hope you should see it.
@theNMTC My pleasure! Looking forward to "A Slice" in May.
