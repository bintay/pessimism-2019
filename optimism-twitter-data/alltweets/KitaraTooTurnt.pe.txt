Idk the whole mental disorder and suicide thing really hits home for me, so I seriously dont take that kinda stuff lightly
It just bothers me so much how someone can post judgement on something a person struggles with day by day
I just dont understand how u can criticize someone for having a mental illness; its something they cant control &amp; ur holding it against them
Proms just like any other dance except ppl put this stupid glorified expectation on it just to get disappointed that u just wasted all ur $$
People make prom way too big of a deal
