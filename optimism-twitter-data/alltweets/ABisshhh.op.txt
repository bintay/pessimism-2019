Conversations that you actually learn things about someone rather than just the usual "hey what's up" are better
@therealklid don't say that
does anyone want to come over
if the only way you can keep a conversation going is by saying what's up constantly then chances are I'll leave you on read

@Kaylahwallace_ @rilezcoco @blackgirls @babygirl baby girl is no where in sight though :/
@rilezcoco @blackgirls

@maddyyy_gracee people's just don't realize how bad Kendall is winning like she's winning on the daily <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@RahabShoulders I mean kinda like what you have to use unnatural shit to look good if she didn't do any of them she wouldn't look good
@RahabShoulders it ain't even natural <SLEEPING FACE>
@Kaylahwallace_ like im honestly trying to bust the fattest nut in her
how do people think Kylie is badder than Kendall???
@charliendresss @vicnichelle that's why you have private messaging ladies <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
it bothers me when people take a picture of nothing on snapchat &amp; put what they're feelin or their thoughts and then post it on their story
I want someone who can stick it out with me through the best &amp; worst times
it's getting to the point where if you decide to not fuck with me anymore it's whatever because I'll just move on &amp; forget
I don't give my time to just anyone nowadays. <SLEEPING FACE>
let's just fast forward through this last month &amp; let it be summer already
but if she bad I may hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
@_reiser_ what are you on

Keep your shit lowkey &amp; watch your life get a bit better
always watch out for the snakes they always come in the slickest disguises<SNAKE>
Lowkey just want to chill and cuddle <SLEEPING FACE>
treat your man with a booty pic everyday for staying loyal to you &amp; holdin' it down through it all
I feel like Tom Brady cause 12 on my back
I hate seeing couples arguing &amp; not enjoying each other because having someone who loves you for you is a special thing &amp; it's irreplaceable
@chandlerfaye_  I mean hey whateverrrrr you say<WINKING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
@chandlerfaye_ don't even flex chandler that's the only reason why it would smell like weed<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

looking at the Coachella snapchats makes me can't wait to go one day
I just wanna be rich enough to take care and give back to my mom &amp; my day 1's that's been there through it all, good and bad
it really irritates me when females try to act hard like niggas &amp; step up to u &amp; wild on u like they want problems knowin u cant do anything

I hate getting the urge to text someone but knowing the conversation won't go anywhere
imagine the world if you could read people's minds and know exactly what they are thinking about or what they're feeling
@giannalentzz what if it says probs thinking about the beach w Gianna
@_kearaderai she was only in the movie for like 30 seconds!! don't get me wrong it was a pretty good movie just was sad she was in it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@haileyyboycee I woke up like kinda screaming because like my body was shaking forcing itself to wake up from a dream because it was bad
I hate waking up from nightmares
your snapchat story isn't interesting at all if all you do is vape in it
It sucks getting flashbacks or memories of things I do not want to think about or remember
that was a crazy good game
@Kaylahwallace_ get the fuck out
@Kaylahwallace_ what was the reason todah <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Kaylahwallace_ why
@giannalentzz you're too small for a truck

@livvyaudrey @ChanSeeksTruth let's all hangout soon
@ChanSeeksTruth that was nice too but there's stuff in that movie normal people couldn't do like when Hobbs broke his cast by just flexing<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ChanSeeksTruth yesss that was dope as hell <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> or the way toretto got shaw captured on the street garage
@ChanSeeksTruth I feel you on that, the better scenes were the ones that included deckard shaw
@ChanSeeksTruth especially vin diesels<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ChanSeeksTruth I thought it was pretty good but there was some scenes that bored me
@AllHailTalib even though she only made a 20 second appearance everyone was like "why" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@gox_fang I mean im not afraid to say oh that nigga pulls bitches but u got me fucked up if u think im gonna be like "oh that nigga is cute"
@gox_fang this is so inaccurate
@aacostello bringin on over tumblr to Twitter I see

@gox_fang Jacob <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SLEEPING FACE><SKULL>
@gox_fang it's just a world full of snakes but there's a select few real ones that can actually keep it to themselves but they're rare
it's always scary telling people your secrets because you're basically giving them the power to do whatever they want with your secrets
stop trying to be someone you're not in order to make others happy, do what makes you happy because your happiness is the most important
it's sad to see the things people do to bring people down because they can't stand seeing them better off without them
@cecile_andrade just keepin it real <SLEEPING FACE>
