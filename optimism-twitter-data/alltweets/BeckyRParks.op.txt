@scottfoval Nope! He gave a licking but he will keep on ticking for the Paul campaign. 
@JimmyDonofrio Very important distinction.
Time to reset the office calendar. 
I prepare our trackers for a lot of things.  I do not prepare them for being licked by Rand Paul’s operatives:  
@patdennis We're hiring if you want to make a career of it.
"So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world."
"Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair."
In honor of @NDP_HQ results in Alberta tonight, I’m re-reading Jack Layton’s wonderful Letter to Canadians:  
MLB and every other sports league needs more owners and execs like this: 
@tywesleycobb That was going to be my next suggestion.  Isn’t it the middle of the night there?
@tywesleycobb Best bet could be wait for it to go up on YouTube, which should be really soon after it airs. Jealous that you’re in Botswana!
@jonathanchait Spellman is a women’s college, so if they have a baseball team at all that would be noteworthy.
@woodhouseb @igorbobic @American_Bridge I bet I know where we can get one cheap at a police auction.

@Tiernanbrady We’re thinking of you here in DC and I’m sending all my best Get Out The Vote wishes your way!
Happy Paddy's Day to @Tiernanbrady @brianatglen and everyone working for equality in Ireland! 65 days til #MarRef!

@dcbigjohn All political conventions are basically glorified penal colonies.
Happy bday, Lincoln. One of our greatest presidents and the origin of the word Michigander.  Take that, Lewis Cass. 
@Michiganography done! Most tweets from me are sports and music related. Or political snark.
This tweet was composed just blocks away from the White House:  
@cjane87 Beginning to doubt that you actually went to college in Michigan…
Huge thank you to the crew of @SouthwestAir 3967 who got us out of San Diego so efficiently and with nothing but smiles and good humor.
Why isn't Van Lear Rose on Spotify?  All this talk about Loretta Lynch makes me want to listen to it.
I don’t think deploying accountants to guard the border is a very good idea.
I KNOW ‘CUZ I WON BOTH OF THEM
If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it! #SOTU
@AmericanAir Smooth ride with a great crew and it still had that new plane smell. Well done!
Thanks for the extremely shiny and new ride from Chicago to DCA @AmericanAir and @Boeing! Nicest 737 I've ever been on.
Let's do this.  RT @AP: BREAKING: Supreme Court will decide gay marriage issue this term.
@cjane87 Have you gotten to the hours and hours of paint smell yet?  Because that's also really fun.
@cjane87 Chicken parm you taste so good... Beats the non-stop drilling into the celings that's happening down on 2L.
Best song about space more generally is obvs I Don't Want To Live on The Moon:  
Been mulling this since I saw Interstellar and Queen's 39 is definitely the best song about special relativity:  
@JimmyDonofrio @woodhouseb If a headline contains the words "RNC Member" and "Racist," Dave Agema will be found inside. Never fails.
All of my best startup ideas are already taken.  
Meanwhile here in 2015, this new Waxahatchee song is so good: 
New Sleater Kinney and Belle and Sebastian albums streaming on NPR First Listen today.  1998 is going to be the best year ever!
Deep like the gradnest canyon.  Wild like an untamed stallion. RT @woodhouseb: MITT!!!!!

Only good thing about this tweet is that now I'm gonna listen to License to Ill. MT @JebBush: You got to fight...for your #RighttoRise
@cjane87 @richeisen When I lived there the School of Public Health did a staph infection study that specifically examined Markley residents.
@cjane87 @richeisen As a former resident of Markley I can attest that only the strong survive.
DC needs a forum for public shaming of businesses or construction sites that fail to salt and shovel their sidewalks.
This is the kind of presidential leadership we need:  
Where have these stickers been my whole life? 
Ban football.
Great book, perfect setting. 
Year of Books Bonus: I finished a re-read of Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay as an audiobook walking in NYC today.
My Year in Books is kicking off few  days early with The Martian and I need suggestions for what I should read next. 
This is the  best press conference in the history of the republic.  #banmen
Here it is, your moment of zen with @woodhouseb

When the Whip Comes Down is one of my favorite Stones songs, but kind of a weird choice to play between panels at a human rights conference
@ntroeste Root for the meteor.
@JimmyDonofrio Cerulean is going to be the boss of all us come 2030 or so.
@JimmyDonofrio This kid with the bow tie is so adorable that it’s almost painful to watch.
@daveweigel As an actual oppo researcher (and non-MM member) I endorse this.  Political pros engage in jocular trash talk?  The horror!
Some amazing and rare pics of the Edmund Fitz 39 years and one day after she was lost: 
@jlfeder Thanks for the service journalism!  Was wondering what the hell was going on out there and why I wasn’t invited to the party.
Amazing! RT @tywesleycobb: This happened at the @HRC #NationalDinner with the gorgeous @GeenaRocero and @billclinton 
@gaywonk I always suspected that Foucault's Discipline and Punish was really about kinky sex.
.@gaywonk Big hug for trackers everywhere. You have to laugh or you’ll cry your eyes out.
Yep. RT @jlfeder: Wow, @hrc is being super trolly to @WCFamilies 
Maybe 2014 doesn't quite mark the apex of Washington's ascent. But we hear big things may be on the way in 2015.... 
New Sleater-Kinney album and tour?  Happy Monday morning!  
I have long suspected that Don Young was the MOC most likely to have killed a man for looking at him funny:  
@JimmyDonofrio So that's where 1996 went.  I've been looking for it.
@devanb Somebody call 1999 me.  She is going to be so excited about this!
.@Shinola is opening a store in DC in a building that was recently a homeless shelter.  I have so many feelings: 
@JimmyDonofrio FACT:  These phrases are shouted an average of 6.3 million times at every professional military engagement too.
@JimmyDonofrio Which delightfully classy establishment is that? “Puss Drinks” is where they keep all the milk for cats, right?
Listening to this and thinking about everyone waiting in line for #DayOneNC Hurry up, judges!  
@JamusLynch Money well spent! He won despite the fact that his idiot son/manager couldn't get enough signatures to get him on the ballot
It's election time once again and that means it's time to reflect on the best campaign jingle of the last 20 years:  
@jaycrey @mgoblog I think Landry from Friday Night Lights is a great pick.  He knows his stuff and Crucifictorious can play at halftime.
@jrahlan Congrats! You’re officially at the longest game in postseason history.
Bullpen in a bag, bag in the river.
But who is going to watch the people watching the watchers?  
@dpcrawf Good method for reducing the toddler population too.
.@mgoblog New theory:  It’s actually Dave Brandon who got concussed on Saturday.
@mgoblog Alumni can sign too if you can remember your uniqname and password.
Can't believe I remembered my password. Must be important. RT @acgola: Alumni can sign too! Dust off that uniqname. 
The real leaders and best.  RT @mgoblog: This statement took so long because the medical staff refused to lie.
Merry #Clinchmas to all and to all a good night! Your Detroit Tigers are the AL Central champs for the fourth year running.
Looked this up.  Wish I hadn’t.  MT @DetroitTigersPR: Rajai Davis left tonight's game with a grade 1 pubic symphysis sprain.
Fire Hoke. Fire everyone. Burn it all down. We'll start again in a better place.
Season 6 of Parks and Recreation is on Netflix now?  I think I just got some weekend plans.
Please! RT @jlfeder: Seriously @tweetdeck, bring back the translate feature. You’re killing me.
Scott Lively called me and @HRC "literally demonic" today.  Check out Export of Hate and find out why he's so angry: 
Drill here, drill now for more daylight! MT @capitalweather: We're losing daylight fast now, about 2 min 30 seconds per day in Sept.
@ntroeste That one is a close second, but it loses a few points because ORD is such a haul from the city.
I may be a bit biased, but the north to south river approach into DCA is probably the best way to end a flight in the whole country.
.@HRC's report on the World Congress of Families is mentioned in the WCF's Wikipedia article.  Pretty awesome.

When do polls close in Scotland? Will my distant relations in Clan Macrae finally throw off the yoke of English oppression once and for all?
This story about "tea party Satanists" is my everything.  And of course it's from Detroit:  
My team at @HRC is putting haters on notice this week.  Stop exporting your anti-LGBT ideas overseas:  
@seanasdf Stop it. You're making me miss the Midwest.
Martin O'Malley's War of 1812 obsession is extremely endearing 
@dpcrawf Nobody should be called a mixologist.
Are anti-LGBT and anti-choice activists at the World Congress of Families violating US sanctions on Russia?  
OK, who angered the sky gods?  RT @capitalweather: Heavy rain across Arlington, northern DC now. 
.@ShaunaCDaly If it was advised as public event, fair game.  Otherwise, not cool.  Either way, it beats tracking on icy roads in Iowa in Jan
I'm on this week's edition of @StateofBelief radio talking about @HRC's new report on the World Congress of Families

Like equality? Like stickers? @HRC will make your day at 
Story of my Seder last night. RT @alexnazaryan: And then Moses said to Pharaoh, "Hey, did you see what US Airlines tweeted?"
