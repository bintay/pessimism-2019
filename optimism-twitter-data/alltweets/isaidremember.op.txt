@ghostkidtaylor HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
Taylor hasn't announced it yet, but I am also in the Bad Blood music video. <SMIRKING FACE>
Ah god yes the live version of Haunted just came on
Untouched by The Veronicas is still my jam!
We miss you little rock star <PURPLE HEART> 
When am I not wearing concert tour t-shirts, honestly. :)
Say you'll remember me

@SerayahLove 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
So I just downloaded a mash up of Wildest Dreams and Without You (by Lana Del Rey) and listening to it is a true magical blessing.
Meant to Be Tour: Live in Boston 
Parachute!!!! :) :)
Slowly but surely getting this photoshop thing down
@isaidremember HELPPP PLEASE! :)
I'd be surprised if Taylor performed at the Billboard awards because she's already doing this huge thing with the Bad Blood music video
@isaidremember *its
Okay HYGTG used to be my least favorite on 1989 but I jammed out to it today and now I have a full new appreciation for it's cuteness

me: *teaching my daughter about art*

me: describe color red

child: Taylor's 4th album

me: you make me ‚Ä¶
JUST DON'T part is my favorite part in Bad Blood
Thank you so much for existing.
Bye.
@wondrlandswift this made my night, thank you so much Kassy. Love ya!!! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
@taylorswift13 THANK YOUx Infinity for putting New Romantics on the set list.
Can someone Photoshop myself into the bad blood poster <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>üèº
I just gave the best performance of my life right now while singing to You're Not Sorry in the car
SHIT NO HE JUST SHOWED UP <POUTING FACE>
@tswizzhasstyle thank you!
Omg this is insanely funny and scarily accurate

I've tried to recreate this picture with my cat so many times but he violently responds with vicious scratching 
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady

I crave your lovin' on me, your lovin' on me, your lovin' on MEEEEEE
Besides Taylor's, this is the best poster<THUMBS UP SIGN>üèº 


@taylorswift13 @karliekloss YESSSS!!!!!

@karliekloss 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
@lightmeupswift photoshop! But only try it if you're good at it. I've been struggling haha.
Vote for Taylor: 
I've loved Tell Me Why so so much from the very first day I heard it
@lightmeupswift yeah, that one is perfection
@lightmeupswift that's okay. Which one is?
I know everyone always says it, but Speak Now is my favorite
@movelikeswift hahaha no, it's okay :)
@newsoundtrackx Jaylor songs are the best!
Remember when Taylor sang Last Kiss to Joe... that was amazing
Listening to Last Kiss (Live) makes me crawl into my closet and lay in the fetal position
<BROKEN HEART><BROKEN HEART><BROKEN HEART> 
This is completely stunning! 
I really wonder what the Bad Blood remix is going to sound like... <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
No matter how many times I watch a Parks &amp; Rec episode, I still laugh really hard at the jokes I've heard a million times.
Bridges are me favorite part of a song and Taylor always has the best ones so I'm always happy about that

<WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX> <WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX>

Did Taylor miss an opportunity? 

@kendricklamar 
#BadBloodMusicVideo 
I've been trying to photoshop myself into the Bad Blood poster for the past hour and sadly, it's not going too well.
Okay I really like Chains by Nick Jonas <DANCER>üèª
@MyChoiceIsTay13 ahhh okay, thanks!
@MyChoiceIsTay13 How did you create your own Bad Blood poster? It looks great BTW! :)
The Speak Now World Tour owns my heart

Me: 
Happy Mother's Day to our Mama Swift! <GROWING HEART><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<GROWING HEART>

@1SwiftieLove3 like hey, we don't want to see your ass, haha thank you very much!
@1SwiftieLove3 haha me too! Ellen was just a tad bit confused...
If I ever get a picture with Taylor, I want it to be a silly one <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
I hope Taylor notices me soon 
I love being hopeful and optimistic but at most times, it's a let down.
@1SwiftieLove3 I mean, I was expecting something outrageous. Haha
Stuck in Love was suchhhhh a good movie
Those shorts aren't even that short?!? LOL 
Watching Stuck in Love and both Logan Lerman and Nat Wolff are in it <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
Ed Sheeran - Photograph (Official Music Video) 
I love this. This is so precious!
Are there any pictures of the short shorts? That's all i care about
If I disappear, you don't have to know where you're going, just where it is you want to be
Picture of the shorty shorts please!

113 days 1 hours 29 minutes to 1989 WORLD TOUR SAN DIEGO!!!!!!!  
Do you ever think about how Abigail grew up with Taylor and has seen her success just catapult and become the worlds biggest pop star
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
I just want to forget about how expensive they are and buy 1989 floor tickets for LA
@ShakeItOff1313 yes!!! Exactly haha
1989 W. Tour - New Romantics (Live in Tokyo) 
Can it be next week already so I can watch the live stream of Rock In Rio
AHHHHHHH 11pm to 1am 
Can't wait to lose more sleep! <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@sojumpthenfall oh I know. I loved them as a couple. I haven't even watched the finale since it aired because it just made me so mad.
@sojumpthenfall it sucked!!!But good thing they created an alternate ending where the mother actually lives and it's happily ever after
Her beauty has reached stratospheric levels 
@ShakeItOff1313 yeah! At least you'll get good quality videos!
@ShakeItOff1313 aww no!
@taylorswift13 @LilyAldridge OMG

@ShakeItOff1313 ME TOO!!! It's going to be amazing!!!
@ShakeItOff1313 NO FREAKING WAY!!!!!!
@ShakeItOff1313 AHHHH OKAY
IS THIS TRUE?! 
@sojumpthenfall ahh okay but I still feel bad  haha
@sojumpthenfall omg  I'm so so sorry, I didn't mean to spoil it for you. Really, I didn't know.
@sojumpthenfall why did they spend the entire last season on Barney &amp; Robin's wedding when they ended up divorcing! <WEARY FACE>
So are they doing the ENTIRE 1989 show at Rock In Rio?
@BarriasAna @likeanyrealIove exactly!
@likeanyrealIove I'm so sorry. That is ridiculous!! You deserve better though, he can't just expect that from you.

good lord i love her more than anythibg 
@ABCNetwork @taylorswift13 @billboard HI <GROWING HEART><GROWING HEART>
Taylor Swift is indeed a NATIONAL TREASURE 

#BadBloodMusicVideo 
@ELLEmagazine @taylorswift13 HI BABE I LOVE YA
So happy that Joseph Kahn is directing the Bad Blood music video because he did Blank Space too and that is a serious masterpiece
@kayladanielle__ I haven't listened to that one yet, but definitely will! He's so good!
Taylor is such a smarty pants 
Best That I Can by Vance Joy is my favorite song at the moment
I love this photoshoot 
How does someone keep getting hotter and more beautiful when they already were in the first place LOL 
This is so fearless era <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
The way she describes heartbreak is beautiful yet really sad and I think she expresses it perfectly 
@twentyfiveswift oh definitely, her music videos are always amazing
Bad Blood music video must be really good if she's going to debut it worldwide live at the BBMA's <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>üèº
I'm not ready for this IT'S GOING TO BE CRAZZZZZYYY <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
"Taylor concert tix to see my best friends, duh"
me: remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about m‚Ä¶
I just downloaded Vance Joy's cover of I Know Places... BRB time to go to heaven!
I will cherish my light up bracelet that i get on tour for the rest of my life because it is so holy

@thefoxeswift i know!!!! :(
@thefoxeswift IT'LL BE SO GOOD!
I just watch like 30 seconds of clips from the tour and start to violently sob because i am so freaking excited and excited and EXCITED!!!!
Taylor Swift // I Knew You Were Trouble (The 1989 World Tour Tokyo 5/5/15) 
THE WRISTBANDS OHHHHH MY GOD
I still can't believe I'm going to witness New Romantics live

So excited for you all to finally hear... 


@lovethepIayers that's what I first thought when I heard it!
Always keep your heart locked tight
The only thing I don't like about the tour outfits are the thigh-high boots lol 
It just looks funny to me
How do you soften the thought of carrying coffins? 
We were so alive, only to see us whither and die

Can we talk about how good Taylor's vocals sound during You Are In Love
I love the loop thing in Blank Space, that is SUPER cool!
SHE LOOKS SO GOOD! 
I hope this feeling I'm having that something is missing from the tour goes away after the U.S. leg starts
@taylorswift13 HI I LOVE YOU!

I'm voting for @taylorswift13 for the #BBMAs Chart Achievement Award! htt‚Ä¶
@taylorswift13 love you so much and I'm so happy you're happy.

Pretty much listened to New Romantics all day today because I was so excited that Taylor included on tour
Taylor better keep New Romantics on the set list until the very last night of the tour or else I'll seriously go insane
Vance Joy's cover of I Know Places is so mesmerizing and beautiful
@taylorswift13 ILY
I'm going to be bold enough to say this one is my favorite.

This opening outfit is almost as good as the gold sparkly dress I LOVE IT

IT'S LIKE A CARNIVAL RIDE  
The dance moves the back up dancers do during New Romantics are seriously the exact same dance moves I've been doing this whole time
I am SO MESMERIZED AND SO FREAKING EXCITED FOR THIS TOUR  
Ok but if she included every song from 1989, even YOU ARE IN LOVE, she could've easily added Wonderland!

Honestly so beautiful
What's that ball of mess in the corner oh yeah it's just me sobbing over the Wildest Dreams/Enchanted mash-up
Taylor's screaming in the WANEGBT rock version makes me laugh
Sobs uncontrollably 
@taylorswift13 WE LOVE YOU TOO TAY!!!!!!!! CONGRATS
I love you. I love you. I love you.
@taylorswift13 POST MORE PICTURES ON INSTGRAM WOMAN, I NEED MORE

And hopefully LA! :)  
Taking a nap, be back soon!
@sojumpthenfall a question that always haunts me
I think like stage-wise, things aren't fully set up yet. I think once she gets back to the U.S., we'll see more of a b-stage and the pit.
I'm thinking the big gap IS the pit
@isaidremember at the end of the cat walk, I think?
There has to be a b-stage because b stage tickets were sold
DANG THAT CATWALK I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT STRUTTING
I can't control these tears running down my face at the moment

Wow, those cheerleader costumes are amazing. The Japanese Swifties are so talented in craftsmanship!

@oldswiftie13 totally!
@oldswiftie13 sounds amazing!!
@oldswiftie13 that's pretty cool though! I went to one Red, one SN and I'm trying to got to two for 1989
The red Speak Now t-shirt has lasted me like 4 years and I am so grateful for this
@oldswiftie13 the museum is great! So did I! 
Yeah, I'm not too far from LA. 
Lucky you going to all 5!
@oldswiftie13 understandable! :)

@wiilldestdreams don't say that! There's always some worth fighting for right? But hey, if you ever need anything, DM me.
@wiilldestdreams but  I still hope! And praise the lord for Marina :)
I need to step up my costume game and create something that will get me noticed for sure!
All I have to say is DANG <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
@wiilldestdreams happiness soon! <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@wiilldestdreams Oh okay so it has to do more with the emotional content you relate to now... Totally understand. But I hope you find more
The Incredible Things outfit is SO CUTE
@wiilldestdreams why just because of 1989 being different or??? Sorry if this is too personal!
I better wake up Tuesday morning and find out that New Romantics is on the set list <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>üèº
@wiilldestdreams really? <CRYING FACE> 
Both have helped me so much. But I mean if not Taylor, I would say Marina is the second best when it comes to it
@wiilldestdreams exactly! I feel the same with Taylor's songs/albums. 
But I love Marina, she's so amazing.
@amosjheller @SwiftBeSlaying Amos you are killing me
@wiilldestdreams SAME!
@wiilldestdreams Hollywood, Girls, Oh No!, Teen Idle, Lies, Power &amp; Control, Promadonna 
AHHH JUST SO MANY I LOVE THEM ALL
@wiilldestdreams better than that is really good too. But only those really stick out to me. 
My absolute faves: Starring Role, Obsessions+
@wiilldestdreams so pretty! I only like a few off Froot: Blue, I'm A Ruin, Happy, Froot
With EH, I'm in love with soooo many
@wiilldestdreams totally! Her music is completely relatable and she has such interesting and good lyrics. ELECTRA HEART IS MY FAVORITE!!! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@wiilldestdreams I KNOW!! I've been listening to her for years now!!! She's one of my absolute favorites. :)
My mom told me it would be extremely hot today and to take off my tights

LOVE IS E.V.O.L
@swiftsvinyl did they sing Shiver Shiver? I love that song
@swiftsvinyl super jealous! Love them so much!
I ate carne asada fries and now my stomach is punishing me <PERSEVERING FACE>
I got "Eyes Open"! Which Taylor Swift Soundtrack Song Are You? 
12 Times You Were Jealous Of Taylor Swift‚Äôs Perfect Squad. 
I LOVE THE SPEAK NOW TOUR SO MUCH 
@alltootswift a great idea! :)
If the show is 2 hours and 1989 as an album is 48 minutes, there is SOOO much time for Taylor to sing all the songs plus deluxe
@theothertaylorr @screamsofswift I'M GOING TO THAT SHOW!!!:)
This cover was amazing I LOOOOVVE 
"We're a crooked love in a straight line down" is one of my favorite lyrics, I don't know I just really like it
So I just woke up, thought it was Saturday and thought I slept through my class and freaked out
Anything interesting happened today with Taylor that I missed

calvin: "they're so cute" 
What A GREAT NIGHT 
mosh pitting is crazy but I loved it
You've had a good life, my love 
The tour starting soon just leads to me thinking like this: DHJDKHSKSNEEJNSNAKARHEBBDBX
Anyone else feel like they have to put on sunglasses when listening to Style

CHIC CHIC CHIC <OK HAND SIGN>üèº
As much as I love crazy drums and crazy lights, Taylor's acoustic performances are always unbelievably special and perfect
How can those guys DANCE in heels I have trouble simply walking in them and tripping over my own feet!
@wanderingstar14 number 25! :)
@taylorswift13 play New Romantics girlfran
Acoustic is the word that jumps out to me and for that, I am blessed 
OH MY GODDD!!!!!! 
Somebody save me I will not survive this EPIC AND WONDERFUL TOUR 
I wish I was taller specifically for concert reasons...
Interviewer: Why did you wear 4 different outfits today? 
Taylor: I'm Taylor Swift, bitch!

Wildest Dreams just came on YESSSSSSSS
I want to see all of Taylor's perfect selfies
I got Totally Single! Can We Guess Your Relationship Status With Silly Questions? 
Spot On, Buzzfeed
@kayladanielle__ that's perfect!!! :)
Model Status is high here 
If I died while witnessing OOTW live at Jimmy Kimmel &amp; We Can't Survive, I don't know HOW I'm going to handle myself when I see it on tour
Still waiting for that marriage before 26...The only wrong fortune! 
Remember when Taylor stood on a rock with heels on
Ok so with Taylor and her dancers quoting New Romantics in their Instagram captions, I think there's a high chance of it being on tour!!!!<FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
*eats cookie dough like she's never eaten a day in her life* <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
@playmyacee love your icon! :) and user!

@No_its_Swiftie ahahahaha <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèº
HOT DAMN 
Should've Said No is a masterpiece 
Thank you @taylorswift13 for this masterpiece
I listen to Anything Could Happen by Ellie and I cry hysterically because it brings back all my crazy LA Red concert memories and I miss it
Zac Efron, did you know that you are extremely, I mean, EXTREMELY hot? 
I love having mini Taylor Swift concerts on my own
@loveswift1989 hopefully it'll be sold soon!
@loveswift1989 I don't have it... It's not sold in the U.S. I don't think. :)
-Singer-songwriter with 7 grammys.

OH MY <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
@isaidremember *think
Do you guys thing Taylor will sing I Wish You Would on tour
@isaidremember and then have the real Taylor hide and we need to try and find her <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
They should put all the Taylor wax figures in one room... A ROOM FULL OF TAYLORS
They're getting so good at making it look realistic 
I am in love with the background vocals in Blank Space
Blank Space is so iconic <DANCER>üèª
11:11 MEET TAYLOR SWIFT
The harmonies in Out Of The Woods... I have been blessed
@iamnotharry You're the best!!!! Thank you!

I just remembered that the tour is starting in 8 days and I spazzed out obnoxiously
Listening to Sexy Back by Justin Timberlake makes me want to go to a club and party all night
I love the bridge in Clean so much 
I just love that song so much
HAPPY SIX MONTH BIRTHDAY YOU WONDERFUL LITTLE THING <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
I have to control myself in not coming off as a freak when I see someone wear a Taylor shirt in public
@TaySwiftdotcom @13_tswiftfan SPARKS FLY!!! <GROWING HEART>
If Taylor sings I Know Places and Out Of The Woods on tour, I'm going to go crazy!!! #8DaysTil1989WorldTour

I love boots 
I will find any excuse to wear boots!
@movelikeswift definitely! Like no other picture has before :)
THIS EDIT IS AMAZING <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
When you're in class on your phone &amp;a close-up picture of Taylor's face just freezes &amp; you can't close it and people behind you can see it <FLUSHED FACE>

@GlamourMagUK 
How beautiful 
I've been parked outside my house for the past 20 minutes just peacefully listening to Taylor
Breathe has the best lyrics IT IS JUST SO GOOD I LOVE IT
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
@isaidremember *that
When you know Taylor so well that you can easily identify her lips <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR> 
Picture To Burn is amazing 
why do I always forget about its amazingness
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate the stupid old pick up you never let me drive
Honestly I LOVE going hard to Better Than Revenge and just being so sassy
I always go crazy when shopping at Victoria's Secret... This is exactly what happened today
1989 shirt SPOTTED
I go to the mall and I'm just like I want I want I want I WANT IT ALL
@bIondeswift oh I bet! It's just a strange situation
@bIondeswift exactly. But not only is it weird for him to be there for Taylor, but he's in a closed tight pit with a bunch of young girls <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
@bIondeswift I know. And some get very scarily passionate...
@bIondeswift very very weird <WEARY FACE>
<BLUE HEART><BLUE HEART><BLUE HEART>

@cIassicswift yaaayyy CONGRATS!!! :)
@TSwiftVANCITY @taylorswift13 congrats!!!!! :) This post is hilarious.
Still no sign of Taylor acknowledging my existence 
I bet you that as Taylor writes her hashtags in Tumblr she just chuckles like a little dork
Wow I didn't even notice it was midnight
@swiftiepromises so happy for you! CONGRATS!!! :)
Yes Taylor, but I still really want a book

@Becca13Walsh I was listening to a live version today and I realized haha
@scottborchetta HEY HEY HEY SCOTT <DANCER> Have you visited the GRAMMY Museum yet?
@kayladanielle__ hahah I was like WHATTT?? :)
@Becca13Walsh YES!!! For two years now! That's what I thought it was <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
My world was shattered today when I discovered that the lyric in the song Red is "like the colors in autumn" not "like the colors and arms"<FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
Seriously HOW 
DANGGGGG omg so much beauty in one picture 
Taylor needs to write a book
@swiftsbabee it was up and coming stars/celebs

Taylor in Free People... WHAT COULD BE BETTER <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@1SwiftieLove3 @LindsSwift1989 my goal... But on top of that, you have to do the famous hair flip
@LindsSwift1989 OMG I DID THE SAME THING. I managed to sneak it by though hahaha :)
@kayladanielle__ @Dancinglike1989 oh haha same here I need to save up more money
@Dancinglike1989 @kayladanielle__ I still need to get tickets for LA so let me know! :)
@Dancinglike1989 AWESOME!!! I'll take ya to the exhibit!! And what date are you going to Staples?
@Dancinglike1989 NI FREAKING WAY! For the tour or just for fun?? :)
I'm a ruin
@Multiswift LOL that was perfect. :)
You'd think with all the singing I do on a regular basis by singing along to Taylor I'd be a better singer, but NO I still sound horrible
@Multiswift I'm going to live by that break up box rule/thing. Also, have my catch phrase be OY WITH THE POODLES ALREADY <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><WINKING FACE><SMIRKING FACE>
@Multiswift yes, of course!!! She's taking about Dean and Max, right? I LOVE that show.
@Multiswift don't worry, me too. I still understood what you were referring to though haha so <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@Multiswift I was wondering why you said eggs lol

The way i miss being New York is like a feeling of physical pain
Do you guys remember the movie Get A Clue with Lindsay Lohan 
That movie is my childhood and it is amazing, just amazing

Got my #swiftstrong t-shirt today! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
If someone is going to ask me about Taylor, I'd really prefer it if they'd ask me about her constant slaying, not her love life <UNAMUSED FACE>
I must get Staples Center tickets for the tour I HAVE TO GO TO LA!!!
My biggest disappointment today was  when I found out that Electra Heart is NOT on Vinyl <CRYING FACE>
Anybody else get extra passionate when singing Mine
I love knowing what dance moves to do while listening to Speak Now (album) because of watching the tour DVD so many times
I had a wonderful dream bout meeting Taylor and it was wonderful
if new romantics is not played on tour i will die.
The tour is so close!!! How did this happen so quickly <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR>
@newsoundtrackx oh god!! That doesn't sound like fun! :(
I'm at Panera and I'm currently witnessing one grown man teaching another grown man how to tie his shoe
Good morning!
Happy Thanksgiving from the Swifts (and also the cousins who have other last names) 

Please can my class be cancelled today I'm just not feeling it
Mary's Song will always be so so CUTE!!

@FlawlessSwift89 awww I'm so sorry. Hope you're doing okay.
How conversations with people about Taylor start and how I end up feeling towards the end: 
"1989 world tour soon"
"taylor milestone award"
"14 bbma nominations" 
@taylorswift13 I am SO proud of you and I love you oh so much
<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
Andrea's speech was so perfect, mesmerizing, and completely wonderful... I loved it and now I can't stop crying

HAJDBDBJXJDKWKSN I'M SO PROUD OF HER!!!!!!! 
What a ballerina 
anyone have a livestream link?
It's okay to me if Taylor attends country shows even though she's pop now. She can still support it and enjoy it like she always has
This cuteness just keeps on getting cuter 
Awww yay she brought Scott!!
OH. MY. GOD. Stunning!!!! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Ok but that blue dress looks wonderful and so pretty
TAYLOR NO 
WE DESERVE YOUR FLAWLESS HQS!!

@erinerinfogarty for sure, just the bridge in that song has always been my absolute favorite. But it's okay! :)
@TweetingForTay <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> so precious!!!

@Swiftieground13 I know, I love it!!! Wait until you listen to All Too Well on it <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@swiftforeverbae I know... Her eyes are so unique.
@Swiftieground13 I've got the same one... Just got it last week! :) :)
@swiftforeverbae oh yeah! Totally! :)
@mr0se13 I just started freaking out like a maniac because of all the excitement <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@swiftforeverbae yes!!! Like she's so determined
@swiftforeverbae me too! So blue <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
IT WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN 
Wow this is so fierce 
@erinerinfogarty haha you're welcome! Sadly, my phone died when the bridge came along <WEARY FACE>
@isthisinmyhead OMG this is melting my heart... THIS IS SO SWEET AND SO CUTE. Like something in a dream!!! Congrats! :)
@slaylor1989er @taylorswift13 I hope she does too. It's always better to have her advice and her input... :)
@slaylor1989er @taylorswift13 I know... it's completely frustrating. I hope everything works out well with you and your situation! :) :)
@1SwiftieLove3 haha it's fun, but can be deadly at times... Lol
@1SwiftieLove3 I kept dreaming up different scenarios and really convincing myself that it would happen... But oh well! Maybe next time <WINKING FACE>
It's sucks so much when you're stuck on one particular person and they don't show the same interest and you just can't get over it
@1SwiftieLove3 my greatest and only wish when I went to go visit back in Dec <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@LittleSavage_07 same here.
I just can't, can't, CAN'T wait until my chance to take a picture with Taylor
@LittleSavage_07 I thought the simulation scenes were well done!
@fellaswift13 yeah!!
@LittleSavage_07 I thought it was good... I obviously like the book better but it was good. :)
DON'T TELL ME EYE CANDY WAS CANCELLED?!? I'm going run around my street because I'm so angry
Finally saw Insurgent today
I love looking at the people's reactions behind Taylor in all of her candid shots
*Wants to be famous to have a greater chance of being friends with Taylor*
Beautiful and so graceful 
HOW HOW hoowwwwww <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
OMG NEW CANDIDS where have I been all day
@LongLiveTS CONGRATTSSSSSS!!! :)
@soinloves Omg CONGRATS!!!
@swiftluvsyou ah haha totally understandable!
@swiftluvsyou ok, no worries. Hope everything is okay. :)
@swiftluvsyou we missed you!!
How do we know Taylor is in NY right now
@erinerinfogarty In return...<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 

it's literally impossible for me to not say that in taylor's voice
@TheTaylorArmy SUPER CUTE!!
@erinerinfogarty ah that's okay. Vance is amazing too. But yes!! Such good song choices!! Awesome! I want to try and go to her upcoming tour
@erinerinfogarty OMG OMG YOU ARE THE BEST!! This is amazing! You are so close! Super jelly. How many songs did she sing, do you know? :)
I don't want to feel blue anymore
I love Marina and The Diamonds so much
@wetookpolaroids totally! Me too. :)
Zac and Taylor on the Ellen show together will always be amazing
Me + headphones + Should've Said No = <DANCER><DANCER><DANCER><DANCER><DANCER><DANCER> and lots of hair flipping
@wetookpolaroids I feel the exact same way. Her music and lyrics are really good though.
I have a very special connection with State of Grace 
That song just blows me away every time
Drums are my favorite thing to pretend to play during a song it's just so fun
When we're on the phone and he talks REAL SLOW
*Da dum dum*
@LittleSavage_07 @UberFacts me! <WINKING FACE>
@1SwiftieLove3 they always write such crap on Taylor and it's stupid because it's not true but still, it's frustrating and annoying!
@1SwiftieLove3 Hollywood life needs to just leave and never come back
@sojumpthenfall definitely true.
@sojumpthenfall idk I still love 1989 a lot. But there's just something about Speak Now...
@sojumpthenfall But like think of Last Kiss in general compared to the entire 1989 album, there is more emotion in that one song.
@sojumpthenfall I agree with the emotion... Except in Clean, you can feel it more. But with Speak Now, the emotions were so vulnerable
Taylor noticing me seems impossible
Going to be home alone all next week... I should rebel and have a party
Can't wait for the Billboard Awards <TROPHY><TROPHY><TROPHY><TROPHY><TROPHY>
@fearless1432 definitely! They're so good. Also "Hey Now"is a really good one from that album. :)
@fearless1432 Love them! and this song is gold!!!
@daydreamtay Taylor, Parachute, Marina &amp; The diamonds!!! :) oh and MisterWives :)
What if Taylor does another vlog during the tour
Can't wait for the tour to start and for Taylor to just be surrounded by people who love her so much 
I hope I get a picture like that... Serious goals  
-sassy
-better than revenge sassy
-picture to burn sassy
-monologue song sassy
-Taylor on Ell‚Ä¶
I just want to eat an endless amount of melted chocolate chip cookies and miraculously stay skinny

@SwiftieMika_ @taylorswift13 I'LL DANCE!!
If you're not singing the "play my ACE-AHHHHHHH" part with lots of emphasis in New Romantics then I suggest you do, because it's FUN!!
@taylorswift13 can I be your tour opener
@LittleSavage_07 ugh same here!!
@LittleSavage_07 5"2 is just not working for me lol
@sombreroswift that'd be amazing!

Red era feels!!! 
Taylor sounded amazing In that commercial

@LindsSwift1989 happy birthday!!! I hope it was wonderful! :)
The amount of times I've watched the SNWT DVD... <FACE SCREAMING IN FEAR><FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD><SMIRKING FACE>
Although it would most likely be a burden, it would be cool to read people's minds... Especially with indecisive dudes
I reaalllly want to get tickets to the Billboard Music awards
@newsoundtrackx hahaha same here!!!! :)
@newsoundtrackx one of my absolute favorites!!
@newsoundtrackx I mean, Speak Now has amaaazing lyrics also but with Red, it seems more mature and hauntingly beautiful. 
I LOVE TREACHEROUS
@TheTaylorArmy THANK YOU SO MUCH! You're the sweetest!! :)
@newsoundtrackx yes!!!! The lyrics on that album were outstanding and so beautiful!
@newsoundtrackx it's so good. It wasn't appreciated as much as it should of been. I love it!!!
I can't believe I'm finally getting to see Taylor in a stadium!!!!! CRAZZZYYYYY
This makes me so sad... just WHY?!? Red still deserves so much more recognition 
@YourGirlKimmy @bashfulnjh @zjmgrier @fearlesstragic @alltoosass @OfficialRED13 @Andylovestaylor @TSwiftTheQueen @ashleyc93 sure!
I don't think I'll love any other album booklet photoshoot as much as I love the Red one

@unafraidswift HAHAHA I guess it could apply to both... But I was jamming to Ed. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Look at this queen, she rules 
Oh Nina. 
You should go, Nina.

@KitKatSwiftie13 me for the past like 5 months <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><TIRED FACE>
Green eyes, you're the one that I wanted to find 
Anyone that tried to deny you, must be out of heir mind
#SwiftiesAreProudOfTaylorSwift 
THIS BREAKFAST BURRITO I'M EATING IS SO GOOD
@wroteonpaper AMEN!!!
Praise the lord they brought back the lattes in my school's cafeteria <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS><FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE>
I never realize how many people actually look like Taylor... It's strange!
@_fearlesswift not alone, thank goodness! :)
@isaidremember I just love tights!
I have a problem with wanting to wear tights with every outfit
Here (in your arms) is suchhhhhh a good song and when I listen to it, it reminds me of Taylor Vlogs :)
Hahaha remember when 8 seconds of static was released from 1989 on iTunes and it still managed to top the charts
I want New Romantics to be a single &amp; get the praise it deserves but I also don't because it's a perfect little gem that this fandom holds
I can't wait for new Melanie Martinez music. She's awesoomeeeee!
FAV for State Of Grace
Fav for Everything Has Changed
Praying that I'll have this opportunity this time on tour! 
Can Taylor do a cart wheel
Tegan &amp; Sara's music is so good <OK HAND SIGN>
Taylor is so humble when it comes to her success... I just LOVE HER! 
Over 100k offers from @DSWshoelovers &amp; @Keds are up for grabs. Fastest scores Taylor Swift tix! 
That weird moment where you feel sad but really don't know why and how to fix it :/
Got bubble wrap around my heart
Waiting for my life to start
and the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
I got Jim Halpert! Is Ben Wyatt Or Jim Halpert Your Soulmate? 
I love Jim :)
I love it when she makes this facial expression <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING> 
Can't believe that we'll finally get to see WHO IS Taylor Nation... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
I haven't really started planning for my tour outfit yet and the stress is starting to creep up on me <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Swizzlecat13 every 13th of the month! :)
@taylornation13 SAN DIEGO!!!!
Almost forgot- Happy Swift Day guys!!<GROWING HEART>
Can I have a guy sing Coldplay's Green Eyes to me since I have green eyes <SMIRKING FACE>
I'm thinking that the tour announcement will probably be just more tour dates but I'm hoping it's something more!
So Taylor Nation tweeted from LA... I'm thinking either Taylor or Tree tweeted that <SMIRKING FACE>
KENDRICK. <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
