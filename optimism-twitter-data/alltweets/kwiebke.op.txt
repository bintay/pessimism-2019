"What is happening with school funding  in Arizona is furthering the divide between the haves and have nots." ~AZ parent
"I have had it with the AZ Legislature and their constant cutting of school funding." ~AZ Parent
I'm supportive of these Standards because they're done. Tchrs have been working on these for the past 5 yrs. Don't make them start over."
"We are no longer an Arizona education system, we are a global education system."
Just because you can't do the math doesn't mean that the CCSS are bad.
"The career has to be attractive to get people to want to be teachers."
"We are a global economy and a mobile society."
How do we advance our teachers and keep them in the classroom? #teacherleaders
You have a legacy to make-will you have world class schools or allow us to slide into a third world country. Truth from another sr citizen!
"You are free to not like globalization but you cannot ignore that it is here." I don't want watered down stds fort grandkids.
Love it when senior citizens with no kids in our public ed system stand up and speak with conviction about the need to fund our schools.
"My daughter is a kdg tchr and has not had a raise in 8 years." #shameful
Besides the incessant debate on the CCSS even more tired of ill-informed people being given a microphone to spread misinformation.
I am so tired of the ongoing debate on the Common Core State Standards. We need to move on. Let's talk about learning!
The cool kids will be with me and @dennisshirley and @HargreavesBC this summer. Join us!! 
.@dennisshirley @HargreavesBC Excited to have you at our Tchr Ldr Institute!! Who is joining me? Who is bringing a few friends? #azk12chat
.@dennisshirley @HargreavesBC I'm optimistic &amp; hopeful about this profession I love. Why? The teachers who surround &amp; inspire me. #azk12chat
@dennisshirley @HargreavesBC @JournalEdChange @intl_ed_news I say we start now to change this profession. #azk12chat

I would say that education is directly tied to the economy. Strong public schools yield a strong economy.
How can you "follow the money" in AZ elections when donors are hidden behind corporations and organizations?
Listening to SOS Michele Reagan talk about transparency. How can we have this in our elections when Dark Money is pouring into this state?

@Redhdteacher @mrkotter Been toying w/idea that I bring a group of tchrs to create eval system. If you build it they will come. #azk12chat
.@mrkotter @Redhdteacher What do you think tchr ldrs need to strategically use their voice and expertise in a meaningful way? #azk12chat
@jaimefesta @azk12 I think we do what you do. Invite policymakers to your table &amp; show them what you &amp; your colleagues are made of.
@Redhdteacher @mtedrow You have to want it. Not totally convinced people do. Doesn't mean I don't continue to advocate for it #azk12chat
@jaimefesta @azk12 We are not policy-makers-we are teachers. A good policymaker takes the expertise of tchrs to make good policy. #azk12chat
@AZkochsner @mrkotter A culture of fear and retaliation is quickly developing. I think we need to talk with one voice.
I don't know how those who have never taught a day in their life bypass the expertise of teachers. 
@mrkotter @mtedrow I wonder how we could make this happen...who is best poised to do this?!? #azk12
@azk12 This is where it gets hard because too often it is more about politics than doing what is best. #azk12chat
@AZkochsner @mrkotter I think this is impossible but sure want people who know what they're doing. @mrkotter has never taught but gets it.
@mrkotter Couldn't agree more. How do we get people to understand? #azk12chat
Hello #azk12chat...teacher leadership!

What an incredibly gifted actor @tomhanks is! That montage shies the depth and complexity of who he is. Amazing! #KennedyCenterHonors

@CohenD @azk12 @TomTorlakson @LDH_ed We love our work. We believe when we build capacity in teachers we build capacity in their students.
@AZkochsner I will get a thesaurus out &amp; figure out a new wd! Like Obamacare vs the Affordable Care Act. People love one, hate the other.
We parse out ea pt of continuum. We need continuum of prof practice with quality pd from preservice-inservice-accomplished tchg. #azk12chat
@powderriver70 We need a common voice and a common message.
@azk12 The problem is that many people say they have a mentoring/induction program and what they really have is a buddy program.
@azk12 I would add a step in here...a quality induction and mentoring program with a trained mentor who comes in the rm of beg tchrs.
@powderriver70 Definitely. I also have lots of jobs for AZ NBCTs...teacher eval for starters and we can move right into this.
@powderriver70 Get out of here?!? Seriously? My guess by someone who hasn't been in a classroom in the last decade. #azk12chat
If there were common stds betwn tchr prep programs where what is taught is basically the same, that would be a start. #azk12chat
@azk12 @jaakard Why does it have to be an either or situation? That is the problem with teaching. It needs both.
@jaakard @azk12 I recall when @asueducation changed they had people leaving their program and into other programs.
@jaakard @azk12 Mine was so long ago...can't count it. I do think, like all things, we get out of something, what we put in it.
@powderriver70 Can you imagine a place where the supervising/cooperating tchr was an NBCT? #nbpts #azk12chat
@mrkotter @azk12 Couldn't agree more. I think there is quality found in AZ tchr prep. Can they improve, like everything, absolutely!
.@powderriver70 That is a great idea. I would love to see a true residency model in place. #nbpts #azk12chat
.@azk12 We say we want higher stds for tchr prep but do we really mean it. Recently @asueducation was held as an ex of a strong program.
.@Yoteshowl @NBPTS I wonder if people really understand what it means. Don't get me wrong. I'm all about it but how do we make it the norm?
@WestinLaPaloma Kudos to Betsy for making my parents 59th wedding anniv &amp; dad's 86th bday so special! She made their day! They're loving it!
"When things are really bad they will get better."
If we increased AZ funding by 47% we would still be average in funding. This is what happens after years and years of serious neglect.
The next few months will probably some kind of weird Kabuki Theater and we will wind up right where we are today.
You look at the national landscape and see the progress in MA. Why wouldn't you want a common set of stds? Politics gets in the way.
Interesting question. Do we need program quality to bring in the money or do we need money to bring program quality? Right balance. #azk12
How do we give feedback to new tchrs that is rich and meaningful? How do we give feedback to mentors that is rich and meaningful? #azk12

"Strong public schools make Arizona a better civic and economic place." #dg4az
"Somewhere something is breaking down." You bet this is happening. Budget cuts &amp; refusal to look at increasing revenue--that's the problem.
85% of all AZ kids go to their neighborhood schools. I'd suggest this number would be higher if all schools had all day K &amp; arts programs.

No parent of means denies their child preschool. Why can't we see all children need preschool &amp; all-day kdg? It is an obligation for us all.
I don't know how a state can be ordered to pay money it is owed and someone can say we need to fight it!
As long as we take federal money there will always be a govt reach in our system. Nothing new. I am grateful for that money here.
This state needs to increase revenue for its public school system...plain and simple.
Watching debates. @dougducey You want to direct more money to classrms but to say $$ only goes to classrms shows a lack of understanding.
@edrethink Just read the blog &amp; loved it. There's a double-standard w/pressure on all kids to look &amp; dress a certain way. Who am I to judge?
.@vamboozled_ Couldn't agree more. Excellent job of distilling the facts for all to understand. We will never find you in an ivory tower.

"Schools and colleges of education are the beneficiaries of the churn in the teaching profession."
Teach for America is a beneficiary of the churn in teaching profession.
Because of the churn in the tchg profession, those that prepare tchrs can't be expected to solve the problem. Thought provoking.
@USAirways After 3 back to back trips, your email notifying me of a first class upgrade this week brought a sense of relief. #grateful
Highly Qualified is about out of field placement. Therefore it is a HR &amp; principal issue. They are the ones responsible for tchr placement.

@ColsenOlsen Read my email. Play. Stay Tuned. I think AZK12 Teacher Leader Advocacy Training is stirring in my head! #azk12chat
Just sent a message to many of you participating tonight. I think we can start in  a small way around CCSS. #azk12chat
@ColsenOlsen Oh well...we are small but powerful army. Never underestimate the power of a small group of committed individuals. #azk12chat
@azk12 I often wonder if we really want to be part of the conversation. Easier to point fingers than to be part of the solution. #azk12chat
I think EW article shares insight when working for an organization funded by someone who educators view with great skepticism. #azk12
@azk12 I think the greatest pitfall is to send a message that is not well crafted nor well-thought out. #azk12chat
@ColsenOlsen This is key. We need to work on this. We can help. Provide training and opportunities to practice. #azk12chat
I think the debate on CCSS is a perfect opportunity for teachers to enter the conversation. So much misinformation. #azk12chat
As tchrs we've been reticent to join the conversation. We often speak from anecdote. We need to expand our thnking &amp; repertoire.  #azk12chat
@ColsenOlsen I think tchrs need to understand their role in the bigger issues and that they have an obligation to stay informed. #azk12chat
@SarahWessling Where do you think tchrs have the greatest chance of being a part of the debate? Are there tips you can share? #azk12chat
@SarahWessling Have you had any involvement with Teach Plus or any of the other organizations shared in the Ed Week article? #azk12chat

@Toulouse757 If I had a $1 for every time a tchr said to me "I don't get into politics" I would be rich! Education is politics. @azk12chat
@kwiebke Off on tangents but this is where tchr leaders could make a huge difference. #azk12chat
If I could make 2 things happen...mentoring for all newbies (real, not buddies) and NBC in eval. Oh, &amp; common statewide calendar. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore @mrkotter @AZkochsner We move to a team when we take collective responsibility for outcomes in our dept/gr level. #azk12chat
When I did NBC, that was a HUGE risk. Did it because I wanted more for our profession. I look at where WE are today and am awed. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore @AZkochsner Relationships...it is all about relationships. I think it is allowing others to see you vulnerable. #azk12chat
I "invite" us all to really find ways to support one another to improved practice. Not just new tchrs but experienced. #azk12chat
Often risk taking is taking a stand. Tchrs are afraid to speak up. It is that fear that allows others to have a stronger voice. #azk12chat
@KristofferCTQ @vicarious_lore Love, love, love!! It was #1, #4, and #5 that pushed me. I couldn't settle. #azk12chat
@amerziii @AZkochsner It's creating a safe space to fail. Society doesn't value failure. Tchrs are supposed to have the answers. #azk12chat
Actually when thinking of new teachers...maybe we "catalyze" them to create opportunities to work and lead alongside. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore The best thing leaders can do is to support new teachers and model positive leadership. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore I think we are all leaders but I think new tchrs time to develop as teachers. All in due time. #azk12chat
@AZkochsner Totally agree and I think through leadership we can press that issue. We accept way too much as a fait accompli. #azk12chat
I can own them. Don't necessarily like them all, especially the "fail" one. But when we fail, we learn. Just doesn't feel good. #azk12chat

@Education_Envoy @ExpectMoreAZ I worry about our rural schools. The ability to provide a world-class ed has to be a struggle. #Vote4EdAZ
#Vote4EdAZ I remember a time when override elections and PTO fundraisers were for the extras...the frills. Now they are for the essentials.
#Vote4EdAZ In the absence of state funding that adequately supports our schools, I will continue to support my local override elections.
@MaryBethFaller They should and we should. Huge achievements in very difficult places are going on every day. #Vote4EdAZ
#Vote4EdAZ Imagine what we could do if everyone here stood up for Ed in AZ. Using their voices &amp; influence to promote a quality ed for all!
@ExpectMoreAZ We need to come to consensus on what a world-class ed is &amp; move forward on that mission with laser-like focus. Stay focused!
#Vote4EdAZ @AZEduParentNet Without appropriate investment in public ed &amp; reliance on overrides, we have a system of haves and have nots.
@AZkochsner @annesgreenberg Let me guess...one presenter, one ppt, and one session on differentiated learning. #Vote4EdAZ
@MaryBethFaller @carrie_brown My opinion? We should invest in better assessments and not do them every year.
#Vote4EdAZ I would say that one gets what they pay for. We cannot produce a world-class education system on the cheap.
@David_F2 @ExpectMoreAZ Quality PD &amp; strong salaries/benefits. Revised tchr eval systems should take care of those that don't make the mark.
@YSSarahWomer I don't have kids either. I want a quality ed for all so students have access to great well-paying jobs. That matters!

It is hard to have a relationship with every student when classrooms are filled with well over 30 students. #EducationNation
@losangelista We have been talking like this for three years and I am not sure much has changed. We talk big but we still vilify our tchrs.
@TeachingChannel Shout out for a great resource for tchrs. Who doesn't want an email every day from @SarahWessling? #EducationNation #azk12
No secret that tchrs pay for their own professional learning. Tchrs pay for their own lrng &amp; materials. Inequity abounds. #educationnation
Learning never stops. There is not enough of an investment in professional lrng to keep teachers at the top of their game. #EducationNation
Common Core is more than economic development. It is ensuring that every child has access to a quality education. #EducationNation

Hysterical! Lip Sync Battle with Joseph Gordon Levitt, Stephen Merchant and Jimmy Fa...: 
@vicarious_lore Thanks for facilitating the great discussion tonight! #azk12chat
@amerziii Yes! Right in our backyard. I am sure we could get @mrkotter to weigh in on this one as well as @AFMorrill. #azk12chat
@tarylhansen I would love to hear what teachers participating in the REIL Grant might say to this question. #azk12chat
@AZkochsner @Toulouse757 More people should care. You would not go to a doctor who is not board certified. #azk12chat
Great conversation tonight. I am wondering if we might want to look at the AZ article on its waiver. #azk12chat
@amerziii @tarylhansen "No one likes the smartest kid in the class." ~CJ Craig, West Wing #azk12chat
@AZkochsner Always liked that my practice was eval against stds by a 3rd party.I think it changes the trajectory of a career. #azk12chat
@AZkochsner To me it is intrinsic. To be the best you can be. Plus, I think professionals have adv certs. #azk12chat
@tarylhansen I think culture has to change. We don't have a system of supports. This is a necessity. #azk12chat
@RobbieCRamirez Do admins have to view? Wondering if there is a system that bypasses them and uses peer evaluators? #azk12chat
@AZkochsner @RobbieCRamirez an ongoing cycle of improvement. #azk12chat
@amerziii Perfect role. Peer evaluation is being done well in school districts across the US. We should look into this. #azk12chat
Better than contrived systems to gather pre &amp; post data to show st lrng through ill-conceived assessments for untested areas. #azk12chat
@tarylhansen With proper training and time to do it...I say a wholeheartedly "yes!" #azk12chat
I think through the use of portfolios and peer evaluators, you could have a powerful evaluation system. #azk12chat
@rcordova1 we see it!
@vicarious_lore It is what I want. To eflect on what student lrng looks like in my classroom, w/these students, @ this time. #azk12chat
@Toulouse757 I agree. But in reality...what rich data you could glean from such a system. #azk12chat
I love this idea. I know the devil is in the details but I think every teacher should be able to participate in such a system. #azk12chat
I am curious if teachers would be really game for such a system as it takes more time. We complain about stdzd tests but... #azk12chat
@amerziii @AZochsner @vicarious_lore @tarylhansen Coming in a bit late so don't know what has been said. But I love the concept. #azk12chat
Loved that you honored teachers in this way! Teachers need to be celebrated more. Great challenge! Do this again! #TCMasters
Of course this house is going to be a money pit. #PropertyBrothers
Love is a mom that calls to remind you that tonight is the first night of "Survivor." #Survivor
Getting in touch with your inner glamorous self. Love my Property Brothers. #PropertyBrothers
@nancyflanagan @aaaadams @NBPTS Don't have too many TO people. Hoping to convince them to complete or switch to full. #azk12chat
@Stephen_Sawchuk @RonThorpeNBPTS @amerziii This is norm I want to change in teaching. Voluntary, but, a professional expectation. #azk12chat
@aaaadams @azk12 @NBPTS You are charming and wickedly smart! You show connections to CCSS and classroom learning! #azk12chat
My wish is that the USDOE would really back NB in words &amp; actions. Wish they were more explicit in their guidance in Title Prgms.#azk12chat
I am excited about these changes as I think teachers will be able to manage the entire process to fit into their lives. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore @Toulouse757 Hard work and focused work. We want quick answers. We don't stick with things. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore @Stephen_Sawchuk @aaaadams It is all about evidence...evidence of accomplished teaching. #azk12chat
Imagine what we could do if we decided to put thoughts into action by pushing this new agenda for the profession. Just imagine. @azk12chat
@ElizabethRusht This thinking exhausts me @ times. Biggest benefit for me, improved skills &amp; deeper awareness of my craft!  #azk12chat
Hope the NBPTS works w/Admin &amp; School Board groups. We need some massive messaging campaigns. Those groups can be huge barriers. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore Absolutely. That is why we have moved to online candidate support. Equity...all about equity! #azk12chat
@azk12 The computer I bought last yr was significantly cheaper than the one I bought 20 yrs ago. Life is like that. #azk12chat
Supporting our teachers in rural areas is very difficult. How do we help them see National Board as a part of their future? #azk12chat
@amerziii That's what we need. Each of us moving forward. I want tchrs to understand that NB is a natural step in one's career. @azk12chat
@vicarious_lore @azk12 @ElizabethRusht I would love to see this happen! I know NBPTS is a partner in this work. #azk12chat
@RonThorpeNBPTS What excites you most about the new changes in the National Board process? #azk12chat
Not sure I know what a mediocre tchr is. I've seen uninspiring tchrs but curious if others see them that way.#azk12chat
I think the mediocre tchrs are symptomatic of a larger problem. We haven't supported the lrng of tchrs. We've let tchrs down. #azk12chat
Beginning to think that entire profession needs a new definition &amp; rebranding. It's not the same profession I entered 20 yrs ago. #azk12chat
@RonThorpeNBPTS @vicarious_lore Also wondering what residency programs might be able to do to push this mindset. #azk12chat
@amerziii @Stephen_Sawchuk I saw that and wondered too. I think teachers are a cynical bunch and wonder if that plays into it. #azk12chat
@RonThorpeNBPTS @vicarious_lore Couldn't agree more. How do we change this trajectory within institutions steeped in tradition. #azk12chat
@Stephen_Sawchuk I am curious as to what you think the role of the media might be in people understanding National Board Cert. #azk12chat
@vicarious_lore I am not sure we have done a good job of really communicating its benefits and importance. #azk12chat
@azk12 This is not nearly enough. Too few and more importantly there is not equal distribution. #azk12chat
Thank you @RodelAZ for hosting "A Better Conversation About Better Education." How can we build on today? Know that I am in!  #BetterEdAz
How do we build on the strength and talent in this room to make a better AZ? #BetterEdAz
Thoughtful panel. Can we move the thoughts &amp; energy in the room to action that makes a difference? #BetterEdAz 
Early childhood programs make a difference! Kids w/o access start school at disadvantage. They're constantly trying to catch up. #BetterEdAz
"If you want a better high school graduate you need a better three year old." ~Dr Mari Koerner #BetterEdAz
Match funding with expectations. Bottom line, we need to invest in our schools. Better teachers and leaders cost money! #BetterEdAz
"We need public policies that bring kids to school healthy and ready to learn. This is not a side agenda." ~Dana Naimark #BetterEdAz
"Underprepared teachers migrate to districts that need over prepared teachers." ~Dr Mari Koerner  #BetterEdAz #azk12
@jcasap Couldn't agree more. I hope today is the first day of a new beginning! #BetterEdAZ
You have to have a mindset that believes in our state. Where EVERY kid has a great education. Yes, even "those" kids! #BetterEdAZ
This room is filled with smart people who care passionately about AZ's public education system. How do we find common ground? #BetterEdAZ
Table host at Rodel event. Great discussion around leadership, investments, the arts, &amp; commitment. #BetterEdAZ 
In Arizona we need "an honest to goodness private public partnership" to move the public education agenda in AZ.  #BetterEdAz
"A great teacher in every classroom for every kid is essential." ~Don Budinger #BetterEdAZ #azk12
"Media centers need to look more like the Apple Store than the DMV." ~Dr Tim Clark. Yes! Sub MCs and change to schools! #mobile2013
@hbogo Never have I appreciated you so much as tonight. Stuck in a hotel that does not offer HBO. Still got my Newsroom finale fix.
@SnoozeAMEatery When will your Phx location open? Anxiously waiting!
@SnoozeAMEatery When will you be open for biz in phx?? Read somewhere mid-Sept. Imagine my face plastered against the window...waiting!
Talking about prof lrng. Thrs need time. Extend tchr contracts to 12 mos to give time needed to learn &amp; collaborate. #edtour13 #azk12
Taking ED staff around schools gains one some privileges. Today I was "super important." #edtour13 #azk12 
Great schools have great leaders. Claudio Coria, principal at Alhambra HS is a great example. #edtour13 
Spent time at Alhambra HS today with ED staff. Heard voices of tchrs, students &amp; principal. #edtour13 #azk12 
@Kimpton Just checked into your Hotel Rouge In DC and already lovin' it! This is what a DC hotel should be like! I see blissful sleep!

Great presentation by Amber Parker about some of the upcoming changes about the National Board process. #nbctnetworks #azk12
Thank you, Governor Jim Hunt! #nbctnetworks #azk12

This is one of my heroes. Former Gov Jim Hunt of NC. An original. A visionary leader. #nbctnetworks 
@AnnByrdCTQ &amp; CTQ team...@AZK12 appreciates our partnership &amp; your leadership in Educ. @teachingquality 
The next generation of teachers has to be different. I want to be part if this transformation. #nbctnetworks #azk12
Ron Thorpe, CEO &amp; Pres of NB, speaking to NB Networks. Praising them for all their wor. #nbctnetworks 
There would be no "Mitchell 20" without NEA &amp; John Wilson! He speaks the truth! #nbctnetworks #azk12 
John Wilson shares that "NB is a team sport." He speaks about relationships. That is at the core! 
It's nice to hear @themitchell20 mentioned in so many venues to inspire others. We all have powerful stories to share. #azk12 #nbctnetworks
With your booty out there, high heels, fans &amp; big hair...things happen! Beyonce, your troubles make me giggle.

@maren_johnson We need you to come to Arizona to help us with our advocacy efforts! Amazing presentation! #azk12 #nbctnetworks
@NBPTS @CohenD Wise words. Very useful and applicable ideas.
@CohenD This is very impressive! Quite a system of support they provide.
I want to be Kelly Mueller's BFF. I like anyone who is a hoarder of NBC stuff! #nbctnetworks

@MelissaCTQ @teachingquality @NBPTS I love having you here and at our table!! I think CTQ rocks!!
Just met a SC tchr from 1st cohort of NBCTs. She is renewing her certificate for the 2nd time! What an inspiration! #nbctnetworks #azk12
Are you a teacher who loves people or their content? The ones who love content stay longer. It is all about people. #emergingissues #azk12
"That's not the way the spirit of a teacher works" when asked what teachers want. Love this--the spirit of the teacher.  #emergingissues
@klthomas79 Good point. If your last name is Hilton I think you are expected to take it. Kind of a gift with purchase, I would suspect.

#learnfwd13 Day Four in Minneapolis! Ready to be Google-Ized!
@sherrilync I am ready to be Google-ized! #learnfwd13
BOTTOM LINE...We ALL need to advocate for quality professional learning and the resources necessary to accomplish this goal. #learnfwd13
We need to change people's will to do different where profession learning is concerned. #learnfwd13
@CastoLisa 2nd?!?! Not! BEST! #learnfwd13
#LearnFwd13 The new Transforming Prof Learning Resources are amazing! Check them out! #azk12

"America is one of the few countries where we can truly personalize learning and instruction." ~Yong Zhao #azk12 #azk2030
You can't be creative if you don't have knowledge. What knowlege? Whose knowledge? Good thinking...good questions.
In the age of abundance we consume very different things.
Education is the great supplier of the middle class. The new middle class must be the "creative class."
Individual differences, Multiple Intelligences, Culture Diversity, Passion, Creativity, Curiosity--&gt;Schooling--&gt;Employable Skills.
All around there are unemployed college graduates in record numbers. Why is this?
"NCLB? Leaving them behind from what? Race to the Top? Top of what? And once you get to the top, only one direction left." ~Yong Zhao
Awesome quote from speaker. "Looking at data on a Sunday is like all whips and chains and no sex." Awesome! #yougotmyattention
Substitute the word "Australia" with "United States" and this video is perfect for our context. 
To help, we create a system of the haves and have-nots. Parents, teachers struggle to offset big education cuts 
Purpose for professional learning is about building expertise at the individual level, schools/teams and program implementation. #azk12

"Professional learning is key to ensuring that all, not just some, students experience great teaching everyday." ~S Hirsh #azk12 #azk2030
Great new article. This needs to be shared. New data shows school “reformers” are full of it 
@OmniHotels Lovin' my upgrade here in Austin! Thanks! Also took the liberty of naming my ottoman, Bessie! 
We don't have a shared vision of what we want for this great state. I want a quality education system. From that comes all things good.

Quote of day from Dr Koener after question posed by Andrew Morrill: "He's my straight man. Although if he weren't that would be OK, too."
You can not underestimate the power of collaboration between the supt, the union, and the business community.
"Teachers frown on people getting in their work. They know their work." Anthony Smith, Cincinnati Public Schools
AZ tops the list of higher education funding cuts in all 50 states from FY08-FY13. We also top the list of % of change in tuition. Crazy!
Today for $1 we spent on education we spend $3 on corrections. In 1979, for every $1 we spent on corrections we spent $10 on education.
AZ has a decades history of low funding for its school system. This is our history and we have to own it. And, DO SOMETHING to fix it.
This is not a Republican &amp; Democrat issue...do we want to invest in preschool and education to get our kids in college and/or career ready.
"If you get one kid from a family in poverty through college, you break the cycle of poverty." ~Steve Seleznow
Arizona has the fifth highest poverty rate in the nation.

"There are enormous challenges here but a real desire to make things better."
@edrethink You reminded us the competitive nature we have in our schools as well as the pd resource Twitter can be. Thank you.
@CohenD @arneduncan In spite of my previous tweet, Arizona did something similar to create "First Things First." A way to fund EEC.
@CohenD @arneduncan If people stop smoking you won't cover costs. Double edged sword on this one. Playing on human nature, they won't stop.
@ball4ny wants to use torture on Boston Bomber because he killed innocent people incl kids. Wonder where he stands on the gun debate? #CNN
If we take away the rhetoric and the disrespectful way we talk to one another, you can find agreement.
Education is the key to the state's economic recovery and growth. It is not just about kids. It is about our state. #highereducationth
Good universities are drivers of our economy and innovation. #highereducationth
We have created classrooms where kids are not challenged to think. We have done the same to teachers. This must change. #highereducationth
Higher ed increases the delta between functionality and disfunctionality. For society to succeed, higher ed is a must. #highereducationth
@azk12: A democratic system is dependent upon a broad higher education. #highereducationth
Higher education is for the public good. It is up to us say 'it is important' and good for our state. #highereducationth
In AZ production in knowledge areas on decline. Exports coming out of ground on rise. Needs to be reversed for long term economic growth.
Thank you @WestinSanAntonio! Great room, great stay. Will be back in June! Hoping for a redo. Keep everything the same! #starwood #westin

"Reading should be a buffet not a prix fix meal."
Teaching is not a respected field. We contribute to this by what we say. Hard pill to swallow but very true. Need to change the discourse.

"Teachers are not the deliverers of knowledge but the organizers of learning opportunities." ~Yong Zhao
If a student can Google most information, what role do teachers play and how do our schools adapt to this changing world we live in?
"I am strong enough and brave enough to fight." ~Michael Phillips, Australia. This is the place I hope I am at as well.
"The education I want for my child is the education I want for other children." ~Yong Zhao.
Interesting remark by Yong Zhao. "We are lost. We don't know where we are going."
Three panel discussions on educator effectiveness and not one practicing classroom teacher. This is a BIG part of the problem.
I worry about who will teach our children. #GWEvaluatingEd
The prescriptive nature of our schools IS part of the problem in our schools. Prescriptive programs do not create thinkers. #GWEvaluatingEd
National Board is the most powerful innovation in assessment in the past 25 years. ~Dr. Lloyd Bond #GWEvaluatingEd #NBPTS
How do we account for the fact that student placement in classrm is not done randomly? How can VAM be valid &amp; reliable. #GWEvaluatingEd
@gwGSEHD Great event...very thought provoking.
@lgoldrick25 I think I saw her walk in. I will find her and reintroduce myself.
We do not have a culture that embraces innovation in our teachers and classrooms. To create the classrooms we need, this needs to change.
Prof dev is essential. Eval systems are supposed to be giving feedback to tchrs. This takes time &amp; money. We need to find political will.
Question: Students are typically not placed in classrooms randomly, so how do we create valid and reliable systems? #GWEvaluatingEd
Teacher quality is not just about the individual teacher but it is also about the context in which that teacher works. #GWEvaluatingEd
Dr. Wilson shares the challenges of time...time to gather enough data to create truly effective tchr evals. Huge challenge. #GWEvaluatingEd
Teachers are innovators. How do we create places for innovation where we ALL can learn? How can we encourage innovation? #GWEvaluatingEd
A challenge in eval ed effectiveness is issue of trust. In many contexts it is not there. Without it we won't get far. #GWEvaluatingEd
When we talk about evaluating educator effectiveness no where do we hear about how we support teachers to improved practice. #GWEvaluatingEd
@Marriott I stay in 24-30 hotels/yr. Rm service at JW Indy awesome. They bring more than 1 silly glass of iced tea. It's the little things!
Gotta love my ragin' Cajun...James Carville you make politics fun! Just looking at you defend our guy...love it!. You are wicked smart!
He did not just tell the moderator to go to his website for more details about the budget?!? Seriously! #debate
If you talk to teachers, class size matters. #debates
In Indianapolis and it is Sunday. Just discovered no Showtime on TV. "Homeland" is tonight. @Marriott get with it, preferably by 10PM.
We have an obligation for kids to know the power of what they are learning and its relevance. #istelf12
Schools should be about great passion! #istelf12
Our job is about citizenry. Goal of our schools should be about creating engaged &amp; empower citizens. It should not be about jobs. #istelf12
Technology should allow us be more human and not less. Technology allows us to talk to one another. #istelf12
When we ask our kids "what do you think" and we take action. Amazing things happen. We need to do better at listening to our kids. #istelf12
Thought...Yrs ago technology purchases were guided by the finance dept. Today guided by assessments. We're still not getting it. #istelf12
Technology is about creating, thinking, collaborating. It is not about assessment. #istelf12
If the only thing we can imagine is a more advanced multiple choice test. We are failing are kids. #istelf12
Schools belong to our democratic ideals not our capitalist ideals. Schools belong to our kids...to our children. #istelf12
The design of our schools is modeled after factories, prisons &amp; churches. Disturbing thought as none are models of collaboration. #istelf12
This matters! We need our kids to do better than we did. #istelf12
Listening to 8th grade student who has a very defined plan for his life. Jeremiah Rivas, you are going places! Do well &amp; make a difference.
At Camelback HS, kids have to attend 20 school events during the yr. Great way to tch what it means to be part of a community.
Investing in time, talent and treasure. That is what it is about!
Talking about a world class ed...talk about uniforms, sitting up straight and raising your hand. Seriously? That's all you have to share?!?

Mitt...a few specifics might be nice! Details. Please!
Things that make me go hmmm...still can't figure out how you can be undecided.
Will we have one question on education tonight? One of the top three issues in my mind and yet barely any mention.
Like to think that my vote...a woman's vote...could determine who wins this election. Women's issues are critical.
Interesting that policy makers think elementary students are randomly assigned to teachers. Really?!? Where do they think this exists?

Last IGNITE session &amp; this guy is great. Perfect way to end the first day! Great slides! Imperial County rocks! #edleader21
@bwileyone @NYSchoolSupts Doubtful and therein lies part of the problem. A strong educational system = a strong domestic policy &amp; country.
Holding myself accountable...before I leave Denver I want to meet Brandon Wiley, John Mergendoller, &amp; Scott Mengel. See a theme? #edleader21
Listening to Jason Borgen, Santa Cruz County, talking about social media. Powerful. Need to get my hands on his presentation. #edleader21

Can you imagine the books from scripted curriculum being the only books poor children read? How sad. 
Have you ever noticed that kids of politicians go to some of the finest schools? Don't you think all children deserve that same opportunity?
If a teacher does a good job with 40 kids...imagine what she could do with 20!
Kozol asked a teacher, "How the hell can you teach 40 children?" She replied, "Here find out!" With that she walked out. This yr she has 46!
"I believe aesthetics count in the lives of our children." ~Kozol
David Berliner, my chair, is being described as a national treasure by Jonathan Kozol.

Praise children for the process and they will select the more challenging and difficult path. #learnfwd12
@MEAHolmes So we can't move the kids into the hallway for the rest of the learning time when they misbehave? (I say in a sarcastic tone.)

@HiltonHelp Didn't expect such a quick response. At time, I was frustrated w/my own wifi card &amp; hotel connection made it all worse. Thanks!
Hilton...your "premium" Internet service is killing me! You really need to do something about it! #Hilton
Love panels that talk about teaching and learning in our schools without one REAL teacher nor one REAL student on that panel! Not! #ISTE12
It's easy to talk about being courageous and daring when you are sitting on the sidelines. I think teachers are courageous. #ISTE12
Trying to figure out this "keynote." 19 mins left, one more speaker and a panel discussion. Only need a panel of one...Sir Ken. #ISTE12
Bad planning. Not enough rm in keynote area AND overflow. Epic fail ISTE! Very disappointed! #ISTE12

Indigenous voices get lost. In New Zealand they are losing whole islands and they are working hard to preserve that knowledge. #ascd12

"When you build teachers up, great things happen." ~Daniela Robles #Mitchell20
MITCHELL 20 is a great example of collaboration &amp; what happens when teachers are given the time to talk, learn &amp; work together. #Mitchell20
No matter how many times I see MITCHELL 20 I gain a sense a pride from the privilege of being able to tell this story. #Mitchell20
I am reminded there is so much public television has to offer. We need to support our public schools as well as public television. #ctl2012
Expectations matter. Education matters. #ctl2012
Schools in Singapore are designed to nurture and for the future of Singapore. I am not sure, we in the US, share this vision. #ctl2012
Schools have traditionally been a class mixing place and the more they become market driven, the less you see this. #ctl2012
It is not that we don't know how to build systems. We do. But we do not have the political will to sustain them.#ctl2012

When I hear we hire from the bottom 50%, I'm insulted. Not sure I believe but know my knowledge, skills &amp; expertise is not in bottom half.
Preparation is going deep and really understanding. It is deep thinking and mental preparation. Scripting is just reading and very surface.
"Only in math do we ask 'when am I going to use this?' You'll never hear a 5'9" kid ask why do I have to get the ball in that basket?" #

When looking at tchr eval systems. Ask if it has been validated? If so, has it been validated by any one other than you? Genius! #CTL2012
We need clear stds of practice w/trained evaluators who make accurate &amp; consistent judgments. This is a flaw in the current system.#CTL2012
Danielson: High stakes evaluation systems with low rigor are the most dangerous. We have to get this right. #CTL2012
Listening to Charlotte Danielson: traditional teacher evaluation systems are mediocre and we can do better. #CTL2012
In US, 15% of well prepared teachers leave profession. Increases to 40% when not prepared. Lesson here? Shortcuts do not solve the problem.

“@Andrewbeth: #ISTP2012 Only 1 in 10 applicants accepted for teacher training in Finland. Is there any country that gets remotely close?”
Finland: Continuing education to support the professional development of teachers is essential. #ISTP2012
Schools are often the only place where students engage in the arts. We should not forget areas that educate the heart and mind of a child.
Even teachers who come from our best teacher preparation programs need to be mentored and supported in a systemic way. #ISTP2012
"We can't build a profession while we are tearing it apart." #ISTP2012
We need to change not only the policies of our profession but the culture of our profession. #ISTP2012

"A love of learning leads to a life of significance." ~Travis Allen #cosn2012
Listening to Travis Allen. Overwhelmed at how smart this guy is. When I was a Jr in college I wasn't this smart...I am not that smart now.
Curiosity, questioning, connecting are dispositions that can't be taught but they can be cultivated in the right settings. #CoSN2012

“Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” ~Goethe #intlsymposium
@21edu I am with you on this one! While we start this biz may I suggest to the Omni and COSN they invest in power strips and carpet tape.
How do we take advantage of the data plans that parents are already paying for? And, then how can we enhance those data plans?#intlsymposium
We need cell phone carriers to develop education data plans! This is the key to access and equity. #intlsymposium
Until this moment never understood how access to mobile learning impacts girls worldwide who are limited to the outside world.#intlsymposium
The biggest obstacles to mobile learning are content and access to professional development so that their use is meaningful. #intlsymposium

The Achilles Heel of education? Poverty.
"We can't mortgage our future by underinvesting in education." ~Arne Duncan
Listening to Karen Cator from USDOE. "We need to step off this textbook adoption scenario and move to a digital one." #NBPTS11
We must meet learners where they are without judgement. #NBPTS11
In DC Public Schools 42% of all teachers have 2 years of teaching experience. This is not by accident and is wrong. Experience matters.
#NBPTS11 We have archaic feedback systems for both students and teachers. Pink suggests that we set monthly performance and learning goals.
We are wired for fairness and people want to be fairly.#NBPTS11
Listening to Dan Pink talk about motivation. A task that involves rudimentary cognitive skill, a larger reward led to poorer performance.
Washington Hilton what's up with no wireless internet in the rooms? You are killing me! Get with it...it is 2011!

Watching a spirited debate about education in AZ. Not sure how grading schools will motivate our schools to do better.
US Airways I have flown you so much your fleet is feeling too much like home. Thx for getting me on an earlier flight. See you next week!
News flash...fault lies in an ineffective system, lack of political will and a system that is not funded properly to do what it needs to do.
Really sick and tired of people in business and philanthropy telling me how outdated our schools are...like it is the fault of the teacher.
Hey couple in the elevator at the Sheraton...did you notice that all conversation stopped in your heated moment of rapture?!?

Listening to Will Richardson. No one is teaching our kids to learn with social networking technologies. How do we do this?
"in AZ, we don't spend money on our high kids or low ones." A new definition for equity.
When we focus on advanced, proficient takes care of itself.
"Good teachers won't work for idiot leaders."
We take kids that need the strongest teachers and give them the weakest ones. Nothing new here.

Sec Duncan says one of the problems in our schools is adult dysfunction. He must be talking of AZ.
Education is terribly under-resources.
OK...Twitter fans... Arne Duncan's speech to the NEA is bold. Talking about tenure, performance pay, charter schools, and drop out rates.
We are the system and it is up to us to change it.
2000 of our underperforming schools produce over half of or nation's dropouts...this is a staggering statistic.
Poor leadership drives away good teachers.
Chicago Public Schools went from 11 NBCTs to over 1200 NBCTs in 7 years.

Our schools must be the center of our communities!
We cannot wait because our children cannot wait.
We must be full partners in education and reform...it starts with shared values.
