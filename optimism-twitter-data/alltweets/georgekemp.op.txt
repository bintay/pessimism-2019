YES TOOTING
Let's call it a night there shall we? Good luck everyone. 
We look outwards from ourselves and out for each other. Tonight and from now on. Now more than ever.
No, d'you know what? It's not over. It's never over. We stay optimistic, because that's what we do.
Fuck it I'm off to watch Mad Men. Back in an hour. If the world implodes in the meantime at least I'll have gone how I always wanted to.
@macynyman I know. But it's not over yet dammit!
It's funny, #TheVote will now always represent for me a blissfully optimistic &amp; hopeful moment before the storm hit. We were so young.
@fandrews @NickyGKill @DonmarWarehouse Aw man! Fingers crossed for a director's cut DVD!
Please God for some hope 
@schierneckeretc fuck.
@katie_brennan @DonmarWarehouse I can't even. Very quickly that exciting social media buzz and theatrical triumph turned into a massive turd
#TheVote really was an incredible event. Human and hilarious, thought provoking and immediate. Great stuff @DonmarWarehouse
@PrasannaBanana @DonmarWarehouse it's the most exciting stuff! Congratulations! ("10 votes...if you're lucky" makes you think...)
@DonmarWarehouse how do the adverts work in #TheVote? Is there a 2 minute break at the theatre too?
@thisisdavid me too! It all feels very exciting doesn't it?
Shut the front door! Amazing. 
@thisisdavid It's turning! WE ARE VICTORIOUS!
@thisisdavid Urgh. Don't. 
Hugely important article from @Aiannucci about next Thursday and inclusive, outward looking politics. Read it!

@schierneckeretc @JohnJokesOakes Then let's fuckin jest!!
@schierneckeretc @JohnJokesOakes smell aside, I can put it back if it's understood it's only in jest and not an actual assessment of ur work
@schierneckeretc For the best of reasons! Obviously hilarious but also didn't want to make you feel self conscious about all your hard work.
Southend followers go and see this! Saw it in Edinburgh and it's a really fun and touching show 
So @Daredevil is amazing by the way. @netflix really are brill at making things.

@DameDenning Hey just read the news! Amazing! Congratulations lovely xx
I briefly forgot that the @007 Spectre trailer is released on Friday, then I remembered. A good day.
Morning! 
@almurray Whatever you do, have a meal at Monteith's on the high street. Best food/drinks I've had in years. Perfect Sunday dining.
@AshFrith if I go down I'm taking Steve Martin with me! (So he can tell me all his hilarious FotB filming stories in prison)
@AshFrith (just an excuse to assassinate the prime minister? Also probable. Oh well, it's on the record now!)
@AshFrith probably.
@AshFrith brainwashing in the extreme. One Saturday afternoon it'll be on itv3, I'll watch 5 seconds and then assassinate the prime minister
@AshFrith All of Father of the Bride. All of it. Even the hilarious dog/wallet/pool incident.

@Mark0Connell Surely not! It's a joke right? RIGHT?!

The brilliant @michaelsheen "for Gods' sake BELIEVE IN SOMETHING!" Here here! 
Hey check out @MrLukeMason at 
Never more glaring than the @HarrietHarman Pink Bus mad fuss. Misguided? Perhaps. But the issue at hand completely smothered by colour talk.
I find it quite alarming how easy it seems to be for our eye to be taken off the ball news-wise. Sensationalism after distraction technique.
All right all right, surely there are more important pieces o news than reliving an unfortunate and embarrassing accident at an awards show?

Thoroughly enjoyed @MuseumofLondon #SherlockHolmes exhibition today. Fascinating manuscripts and stories and some beautiful #LondonArt

@Jamesy_Moo It really does stink of wine. I'm worried it's in places I can't see but that will reveal themselves over the coming weeks.
@Jamesy_Moo Well cameras are ten-a-penny. There's one inside my phone! You don't get a second shot at a Mars Bar. #yolo
It looks like someone's been murdered and smells like a Wetherspoons on a particularly busy Friday night. You win this round gravity.
In an attempt to catch my falling laptop, I've just thrown not inconsiderable amount of red wine all over my bedroom. Floor, clothes, wall.
And finally, you're welcome. 
...with a really fantastic score, I was buzzing for the whole night. Such an interesting discussion on greatness and ends/means #top
Also, #WhiplashMovie is just incredible. Genuinely one of the best experiences I've had at the cinema in aaages, heart-pounding...
Can't wait to see @MaddieRice1 in @DryWrite #Fleabag this weekend! I hear it's ruddy marvellous #NotBiased #IReallyDoHearItsBrill
Two things this afternoon I can't wait for: seeing #Whiplash and seeing @MaddieRice1. Order of preference as yet inconclusive.
@harriehayes I'm genuinely watching it now. It's 3.25, what's wrong with me?
@Carpetrider I haven't got there yet. Can't wait though! It's so good!
I need to do things but I've started watching Community and now I can never stop.

@schierneckeretc I'll see your deep cuddle and raise you a lingering and meaningful hand-hold.

Kick-Ass 2: Pretty disappointing. Lacklustre script + direction so desperate to shock &amp; revolt outweighed good performances &amp; premise. 5/10
@lukacekerevac "Hey! HEY! I am not drunk! This song is all about me! Da da da da! Shuddup I grew this all by myself." 
@howlingtwirls ...it was a joke...because Solstice is like Solace...it was silly I shouldn't have...unless *that* too was a joke? Minefield!
James Bond goes to Sweden and is unable to sleep for 3 weeks because of the constant daytime, bungling the case through exhaustion.
Today seems like the perfect day to watch one of my least favourite Bond films of recent years: Quantum of Solstice.
@rclarkie Gridlock! I think that's as brilliant an intro as any. TD'sW is wonderful but maybe more wonderful once you know a few things?
@DannyLeeWynter Even in the films she's not in I'm in love with her. I hear she's got a brilliant husband though so I shan't hold my breath.
@DannyLeeWynter Kelly Reilly? ALL OF THEM!
Flight: Terrifying. Boozy. I'm in love with Kelly Reilly. Really interesting, difficult, frustrating story about addiction. Bit long? 8/10
Monsters University: For a film made purely through desire to cash in on a previous success, I really liked it. Funny bits happened. 7/10
The Wolverine: I liked that bit when he did the fighting but I liked it less when he had that dream. Mmm. Sex hotel? 6/10
So whilst incapacitated at home this weekend, I shall be catching up on films I've been meaning to watch. I'll let you know how they are.
Well tonsillitis is no bloody fun.

@katie_brennan woop! X
@hewston I start acting at 10 today! For now - X Men! X
Finding the early 90s X-Men cartoon series on Netflix has made my day. This stuff is gold 
A beautiful sunny day afternoon treat for getting a gold in my combat exam today 
@omgkatie Jesus! That's us! Bloody hell :) thanks for bringing it to my attention! X
Such terribly sad news. A big, brilliant, bonkers man with so many more laughs to give. A legend. RIP Mr Mayall.
What?! Not Rik Mayall. Anyone but Rik Mayall.
You happy now TFL?! I'm never leaving my house at the weekend again!
Today - I will mostly be wearing the colour "blue". (No change there then) 
@winstanleyh sounds great. Looking forward to seeing them! I'm in barons court just round the corner from lamda. You're absolutely right.
@winstanleyh I need to get fit is what I need to get! X
@winstanleyh What are you up to at the moment? X
@winstanleyh 2016! So I've got a little while yet x
@winstanleyh Oh not my spirit, that's fine. Just my body. And I got a fairly good taste of that before I went &amp; it can't be worse than that!
@winstanleyh I know! Look's fantastic. Very well thanks, completely broken by drama school but otherwise fine! How are you? X
@winstanleyh have you seen this? 

Regardless of my own political views (you should know by now) I do hope all those quite rightly complaining about UKIP voted on Thursday.
@Jamesy_Moo Hey, I'll admit it, I liked him in American Pie. But this has clearly gotten out of hand.
I finally saw Frozen as well. Yep, pretty much a wonderful as everyone says it is. Great songs, visuals, heart and comedy snowman. Big fan.
Beautiful sunset train ride through lush Essex country listening to @Howard_Goodall 'Inspired' - contendedness seems that little bit closer.
@Jamesy_Moo And that's...that's not a parody? Right. Okay. #we'llcallyou
@DannyLeeWynter Happy Birthday!
@katie_brennan #winning Where's that?
@eggfrieddog I really enjoyed Stonemouth too
Tell you what it's tough avoiding Game of Thrones spoilers isn't it? So, basically, everyone dies right? But when?! And HOW??
@LeGateauChoc Grr x
@LeGateauChoc @PenhaligonsLtd haha! I take back that recommendation! (Not really) x
@LeGateauChoc @PenhaligonsLtd The perks of being a fantastic asshole eh? If there's anything you don't want I know someone who's a big fan!
@LeGateauChoc Also, have you tried this? It's brill @PenhaligonsLtd 
@LeGateauChoc Always a pleasure! And I'm very excited about the *shh*...secret news as well. I'll be there! Enjoy the rest of the shows x
Do yourself a favour and go see @LeGateauChoc "Black" @sohotheatre. An exposing, moving, beautiful show for all the a black sheep (everyone)
@CEdwardsActor Surely the 'come' should be turned to 'am' to form a lovely Soreen couplet?
Sorry everyone (I know, I know) but it has to be said; what a badass! #NovemberMan 
If you're free tonight come down to @TheIslington for @RRcomedy. @GiraffeComedy are making funnies with loads of other lovely people.
@mazzoir If you like that you need to find some way to see this man perform! Amazing! @thestorybeast
@johnvoce I'd love that, sounds brilliant. I shall be in touch sir! But for now, goodnight!
@johnvoce Entirely fictional, although fucking a crow in it's own pocket does sound like a winner routine. Hammersmith these days! You?
@johnvoce Hahaha so you WERE at the gig! Almost all right doesn't sound too promising, fancy a cuppa? I'm very well thanks!
@johnvoce How the devil are you Mr V?
@johnvoce LOLZ! That crow never stood a chance! Classic! #gigbanter #toteshilar #context
This is my new favourite thing EVER 
@katie_brennan haha! Now that really would be crossing a line wouldn't it?
@katie_brennan Oh God that is me actually. What can I say, I'm painfully British. Should I change it? I've got one with a strategic doily?
@katie_brennan but perhaps that goes for real life too.
@katie_brennan ...if I were female. Supposedly it's much more difficult to not be pestered for sex if you happen to have breasts.
@katie_brennan ...chat to new people or meet someone in our crazy isolated world. Although I imagine it'd be a very different experience...
@katie_brennan Easier certainly but not necessarily as enjoyable. I do and have met almost entirely nice interesting women just looking to..
@katie_brennan APPARENTLY some people do talk to each other and APPARENTLY a lot of the people on there are actually very nice. Apparently.
Go see it while you bloody well can it's a beautiful brilliant piece of theatre! @RightOneIn
Fantastic evening seeing @RightOneIn with Crazy Nut Lady @SiobhanMGerrard. Visually stunning show. It's a really exciting, arresting treat.
I'm so sorry drama school but I've definitely let my body go over Easter. Stiffer than @cranfieldscurio's taxidermy collection.
Oh God Bob Hoskins. Terribly sad news. A wonderful actor and gent. RIP.
@TheBigBowWow So perfect.
@CatKolubayev RT @mashable Emoji slippers by @modaoperandi What does everyone think of these? 
Genuine question - does anyone actually rate the tracks on their iTunes?
@eggfrieddog Excited <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@eggfrieddog I'd really love that. If you can I'll make it my avatar and buy you a beer!
@eggfrieddog Love this! Do you do commissions?
@HoustonOliver Haha the pressure's on now!
William Shakespeare
Have a Gentlemanly St George's day
@HoustonOliver Haha it's hugely appreciated anyway! It's all in the folio right?! Ruddy editors thinking they know better! Thank you sir :)
@TheRSC #AskGreg Thanks so much! It's my favourite thing to do as an actor and I'm an enormous fan of your work too. Enjoy today!
@TheRSC #AskGreg If you could give one (or two) piece of advice to an actor about performing Shakespeare, what would it be?
@LeadPencilUK Happy Tuesday! 
@NancyAppleby I can literally still smell him.
@Ellen_Gibbons Vinegar and shame?! That's a potent cocktail. Mine literally smelt dead.
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?!?
I want to wash the inside of my own head.
There was a man in a shop earlier who smelt so horrific that his smell has stuck in my nose like that of a corpse.
@DannyLeeWynter Could be that! Could be. Or it could be all the wine? Who knows! Hope you've had a nice Easter :)
@DannyLeeWynter Self diagnosis is, in my humble opinion, always best done sober. Having said that, I think I have quite serious narcolepsy.
@CatKolubayev This drama school is GRRREAT! I'm not even there yet!
@CatKolubayev Oh well. You can keep the books and the suits. I have my pride.
@CatKolubayev They made an exception because I'm more average than their average average actor. Anyway, good luck out there! See you never.
@CatKolubayev Too late. I've filed for a transfer to RADA. You can keep your peanut butter.
@CatKolubayev Oh it's you! I thought you hadn't been cruel in a while, I wondered why I was in such a good mood! #movingoutbecauseIhateyou
@CollinsRosie I think the rockin 80s soundtrack adds levity.
@CollinsRosie I don't *think* so. But there is a fair bit of graphic sperm action.
@rosiealys VHS is the only way to watch them
@rosiealys It's brill isn't it? That and Father of the Bride - childhood favourites.
Which is interesting.
Realised this morning that my entire romantic life has been informed by falling in love with Kirstie Alley in Look Who's Talking as a child.
Argo is a great film. That's all. Nunnight.
@TopekaMagazine @alexgrecian Can't wait!
Just in case you're interested my albums of last year were The Last Ship by Sting and Where You Are by Natalie Williams. Cause they're perdy
And by that I obviously mean - the only album actually from 2014 I've listened to this year.
'Twist Is The New Twerk' by Scott Bradlee and Postmodern Jukebox is definitely my album of 2014. Brilliant stuff.
@ChrisHewitt Have you seen the Episode VII imdb page?? There's names! And 'facts'! Wassagoinon?!
Just seen Danny Dyer doing full Dyer in an episode of Foyle's War. Brilliant.
How? with KISS? gross
"u can just point"
Ok fine. I'll kiss him
"dude we didn't say—"

So if I don't live here one day then I'm done with the universe once and for all 
@katie_brennan @Katiepersil Sorry to butt in but I'm afraid I have to echo that, it does look super buff.
@katie_brennan I'm so glad! Hearty mirth is all any of us want to experience or provoke in the end isn't it? Have a great day :) xx
@katie_brennan I definitely shall! Your list of things to remind us that in the end the universe is a friendly place is very similar to mine

@SammyWarrens YOU'RE a weird thought! Thanks for tonight :) sleep well x
@SammyWarrens Come September - we're eating your hair.
@SammyWarrens @JToTheSizzay how would you eat it?! Where would you start?? I'm getting one for your birthday (of your face obviously)
@JToTheSizzay @SammyWarrens Creepy right?! 
@ollygourley @serenablossom You mean you don't lick your babies clean and then eat the after-birth? That's the best bit! Weirdos.
@SammyWarrens that place looks amazing! Can I have a job there please?
Beautiful run in the sun. Thought I'd share as it's such a rare occurrence. Twitter'll be history by the next time 
Another properly cracking episode of Rev. this week @BBCTwo. Can't kiss it's holy bum enough - smart, funny, heartbreaking television.

@Ellen_Gibbons You absolutely will. But it's totally worth it.
And 11 days later..he approached the final 8 episodes of Breaking Bad. Bloody hell. Maybe after it's over it'll allow me to leave the house?
"Good thanks, and you?" 
"Yeah, good thanks. Can't complain." 
Fancy some quality comedy this evening at @themillerpub courtesy of @InCahoots &amp; @GiraffeComedy? Course you do!  
I like to think it's fate and that one day we'll meet and become the best friends there ever were.
I shit you not, I sit down in the doctor's surgery and what's on top of the magazine pile shining up at me... 
Gorgeous new wallet from the lovely @WildandWolf! 
Did you know: A kiss stimulates 29 muscles and chemicals within the human body causing relaxation. So that's nice isn't it?
Rev. is such a brilliant beautiful show. Wonderfully written, acted &amp; directed. This week's episode was a masterpiece in tragicomedy.
What am I doing?! I'm not his publicist! ...am I? D'you think he's looking?
You will not see a better picture of PB leaning nonchalantly against an ornate chair dressed as Louis XIV today. Nope 
Must stop tweeting pictures of Brosnan.
You might see a better picture of Pierce Brosnan standing in a rapeseed field today...but I doubt it.

@DanCrespin Salright! Been meaning to read it again anyway!
@DanCrespin haha! What page? Gonna look those lovelies up!
@DanCrespin You're joking! in 'Being An Actor'? Who??
I stand corrected 
If this isn't the best picture of Pierce Brosnan in a wig on a horse you're going to see today I don't know what is 
Season 3 Episode 2. Do they stay together?! DO THEY??? Don't tell me!! Tell me. DON'T TELL ME!!!
Is it just me or does Paxo look like he's about to conk out? #newsnight
Uh-oh. Breaking Bad season 1, episode 1. Off we go, I've been warned.
@Ellen_Gibbons are you trying to seduce me Miss Gibbons?
Perfect clarity.
@Ellen_Gibbons It's the only way to do it. I give you 'til Reading before you realise your massive mistake due to my epic lack of prospects.
@Ellen_Gibbons get ready for a terrific life of gender equality and pizazz then :)
@Ellen_Gibbons absolutely. I'm going to wait until the lawful impediments line before I make my entrance though.
@Ellen_Gibbons ah I see! You do look beautiful though, d'you want me to come and whisk you away from a life of boredom and mundanity?

@Jamesy_Moo @oldvictheatre you'll love it!
@DannyLeeWynter Tell me about it! Haha, did he ruin you for all others?
@DannyLeeWynter Very true. We're all doing our best to consume every indefinable, elusive and deceptively simple nugget he offers us.
@DannyLeeWynter haha I definitely will! I think I've got him for Jacobeans soon. Either him or Jimmy Kerr - do you know him?
@DannyLeeWynter To be fair, she's wonderful - as always - but not certainly not the main attraction.
@DannyLeeWynter Has C.H. pissed him off? Am I a fool for not knowing about this?
@DannyLeeWynter It's brill. Really great performances, absorbing script, deft production. Big fan.
It really is wonderful - go see - RT “@TeleTheatre: Other Desert Cities, The Old Vic, review

A beautiful piece from the brilliant @sadiehasler about magic and theatre and my dear 'dad' Roy 
@DannyLeeWynter haha! They're basically the same. Except there's more back-stabbing and righteous anger in House of Cards.

@DannyLeeWynter that and 'laughing' yourself on to the ceiling?! They're all high as a kite
@DannyLeeWynter we (@GiraffeComedy) do a sketch about just that! It's implied. She was his dealer apparently.

Todays "just enjoy your bloody life lemonade and stop trying to get the bus to the grove" quote was brought to you by Mr Bernard Shaw.
'For know, rash youth, that in this star crost world Fate drives us all to find our chiefest good in what we can, and not in what we would.'
Maybe it's because I don't get it very often and it reminds me of a simpler time but it's underdog approach is always heartening.
Although, of course, the Jubilee Line remains my favourite; there's something about the rickety charm of the Bakerloo I find hard to resist.

@eggfrieddog I'll steer clear! Ditto, just wondering whether to start that or Wolf Hall (bandwagon klaxon)
@eggfrieddog it's all going to shit! Have you read Wool? Would you recommend it? Similarly, Gone Girl?
@eggfrieddog haha! I shall have to pop along to one of your television burning rallies.
@eggfrieddog Along with how good it's getting, supported by companies like Netflix. It's this or piracy &amp; not reading. I'll stay legitimate.
@eggfrieddog Mostly bought from your fine employer. But I also continue to love the brilliant storytelling medium that is television.
@eggfrieddog Well that's definitely not true. Searching for, buying and reading great books will always be one of my favourite things to do.
@therealcginge Oh God, I don't have time for this! Might have to ration my laptop time.

@DannyLeeWynter Well we were all proud anyway! Came during our first week. Thanks very much :)
@DannyLeeWynter How funny mine did too! He's a very sad little fellow which is a shame cause I'm ruddy loving it. Really enjoyed MuchAd btw!
@DickLeFenwick 4 months at LAMDA... 
"Will come when it will come." - The passage from Julius Caesar underlined by the great man whilst in prison. RIP Nelson Mandela.
"Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end..."
"Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once..."
..and a tribute to the Beeb which they placed against a show it couldn't beat and have punished it for that. Terrible terrible unjust shame
Completely bowled over by the BBC's decision to cancel @ripper_street. One of the best shows on TV, brilliantly written and performed...
@The_Globe Tony &amp; Cleo, Julius, Comedy of Errors and Titus?
@THEKERRYHOWARD what?! Has it died?? No one told @GiraffeComedy!
@kirsty_oswald just seen you in @ripper_street! Congratulations! Hugely jealous - absolutely love this show.
@Katiepersil break a leg!
@alhimself it's no more than they deserve sir
@RufusHound @BBCiPlayer absolutely brill wasn't it? Especially THAT moment. Phew!
@omgkatie gosh you've got all the answers haven't you! Super Stalker!
@omgkatie ah that's what it is! Fair play. I'm going to have to lock the door when I go to sleep now though - can't afford to lose any more.
@omgkatie good stuff. You must let me know how that's coming along! I've got some hair here too if you want it.
@omgkatie fair enough. See you at the bins later xxx
@omgkatie but it's the perfect way to keep up to date!
@DrewAspland seconded! And we got a flash of Capaldi's magnificently furrowed brow. And Gallifrey's back! Which is..nice. I don't want to go
@DrewAspland Aaaaaaaaaand....?
Oh sure. Brill. #SaveTheDay
50 minutes to go! #SaveTheDay
@eggfrieddog @KermodeMovie bottom.
Mightily excited about Saturday #SaveTheDay
@DaveBibby really? I gnawed my fingers off!
@DaveBibby it's tres tres good and in 3D's definitely the best way to see it
@kingofcufflinks The same as Tony Curtis in The Persuaders no?
@winstanleyh The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. You should give it a go I'm hooked. Devon always wins.
@winstanleyh Saw this in my book and thought of you! X 
Utterly brilliant night @bertiewooster tonight. Hilarious and brilliantly executed - a must see!
Jolly excited with @omgkatie 
@Hescottburke it's on the You Tube! I've just started it! What a cast. Blimey.
@Hescottburke Amazing. I've heard wonderful things I shall have to check it out!
@Hescottburke WHERE??
...they deserve but it feels like they're all sharing the same dozen actors!
Blimey are the BBC's drama dept on some sort of actor exchange programme? I don't like to complain about good people getting the work...
A bit more of that please RT @BritishGQ: "What happened to our manners?" @TonyParsonsUK on British civility 
And it all ended very well indeed. Thanks everyone for a brilliant weekend! And remember, 'Don't have a box new!' 
False alarm. Just a small man.
I'm not 100% sure, because let's face it I'm the last person who would be, but I think Tiny Tempa just got on the tube.
Wichita Lineman just came on the iPod reminding me that @TerryAlderton starts in Albert Sq on Tuesday! Good luck mate, I'll be watching!
#perfectbirthday 
This is a thing now?! Blimey. #welcometothe21stcentury 
The big day continues with the big guy's grave 
HILARIOUS present from @omgkatie. Thanks darling! #whatabitch 
@CatKolubayev birthGAAAAAAY
Stage one completed! 
My attempt at the perfect birthday begins! Waking up in beautiful Stratford Upon Avon, we start with a great big fry up...

@brodier1 Michael! That's going to be great fun! Have a brilliant brilliant time! Thank you very much! It's the best hard work there is :)
@brodier1 who're you playing?
@FuckSakeAmy @omgkatie The Disclaimers should definitely have featured. Did you both enjoy it?
@FuckSakeAmy @omgkatie uh...OF COURSE! We had a screen to ourselves! Much singing ensued! Have you?
@rebecca_w97 You'll start to like olives too. Weird eh?
@Markgatiss What's next for Lucifer Box? I miss him! Possibly another book/maybe an adaptation? (P.s. Can I be in it please?)
@rebecca_w97 because it's delicious! And nice wine is nicer than not nice wine! US OLD PEOPLE LOVE WINE! :)

@Rachel_Ahlquist @hayleydailily bloody hell you two! Way to scare a guy! I will be careful with my lemsip intake. You may have saved a life.
How much heed do we pay the "recommended dose" on the Lemsip box? Honestly? What can one expect from an OD?
@sadiehasler "There'd be none of this shit if Branagh was at the helm. He throws it all in. Mind you he usually plays all the parts as well"
@sadiehasler "I know but nonetheless he's calling the shots and unless we take out of the tap dances I don't think he's gonna go for it."
@sadiehasler "D'you know I have! But Hytner said there was only so far we could take our Hawaiian-set, all-alpaca production. Partly agree."
@sadiehasler "That was one of John's wheezier shows wasn't it? I shall eclipse them all however mother-loving eye-gouging moccasin-consumer!

@sadiehasler *adjusts tie* “You look like something that might have occured to Ibsen in one of his less frivolous moments. Good day!"
@hewston @sadiehasler Oh God no, never anything so vulgar as 'Score!'. Perhaps an excited holler of 'Congratulations to me!'?
@hewston @sadiehasler absolutely. Style above all things! And what's wrong with a celebratory cry upon climax eh?
@FuckSakeAmy Maybe he saw ours?
@FuckSakeAmy plus! I think the wig is for a production of No Man's Land he's doing on broadway. Even spookier!
@FuckSakeAmy @omgkatie @AliceERyan I know!! Spooky right? Tell him I say Hi Dad!
Patrick Stewart as Roy Foster anyone?? @omgkatie @FuckSakeAmy @AliceERyan 
@MrThomasHescott @stejohnston Phew. I'm gonna goooo....
@Hescottburke false alarm Dean false alarm!!
@MrThomasHescott @stejohnston yeah my bad guys. Sorry about that. Still...Flight eh? Those were some real...cardboard boxes. I've ruined it.
@LeadPencilUK @lsqtheatre and remember; if you wanna be the best and if you wanna beat the rest - dedication's what you need.
@LeadPencilUK @lsqtheatre have fun you lovely buggers!

@tomrosswilliams found this little gem sandwiched in a book today! 3 years later and I'm here! Happy memories :) 
@MrThomasHescott I hear Tory Boyz is going really well, congratulations :)

@Katiepersil Thanks! Well done in Much Ado by the way, saw it this week!
@JToTheSizzay BROOOOOOOSNAAAAAAAAN!

@DanielleePhill Haha We'll all be the same I'm sure! Good luck sleeping! X
@DanielleePhill Na don't be scared be excited!! I'll hold your hand!
@DanielleePhill Can't get a wink! It's like my body's doing it on purpose I'm out like a light usually. Everyone's probably the same!
Oh God I can't sleep. Of course I can't sleep. First day tomorrow and my brain cogs won't stop whirring. Any recommendations?
@love39steps apart from the brilliant @CEdwardsActor, who?
SOMEONE HELP! Nice, cheap dinner near Covent Garden?
@JToTheSizzay @SammyWarrens free a lot! Free all this week really. I'm very excited! And nervous. And unfit.
@JToTheSizzay Start on Monday! I'm currently residing in The Capital! How are you and the lovely @SammyWarrens?
@JToTheSizzay Are you FINALLY watching that DVD? It's the best show ever (still not seen Breaking Bad). How are you? I miss your manly ways.
Just finished 'What Remains' and starting 'Peaky Blinders'. The Beeb keep coming up trumps you have to admit. Are they our HBO?
-The mood will pass.
1st rehearsals today for ht…
@rebecca_w97 Well. That's...yep. Okay. Is it his pioneering work with gangs?
@rebecca_w97 WHAT?!?
@brodier1 Just seen the RSC news! Congratulations mate that's brilliant! Hope you're well :)
@andalexander Agree completely. Bawled like a baby.
@MrThomasHescott Hope you're both all right! Glad to hear the hospital are being good. Bloody Callow.
@Hescottburke Bloomin' 'eck!! What did the nasty actor do?! Are you okay?
@DrewAspland Sorry, I'm demanding too much. How's life as a chef?
@DrewAspland MORE!
@DrewAspland MORE NEUROSES!
@omgkatie my ears are bleeding!! If that's not the best warning against substance abuse ever I don't know what is.
@omgkatie I'll give them a call
@omgkatie I've still got those vouchers they gave us somewhere!
.@omgkatie Loooook! RT @sunshineOLfilm: It's official! Edinburgh's Vue Omni will host #SunshineOnLeith's International Premiere on 17th Sept
Once you've watched it and cleaned yourself up if the first thing you do isn't call your dad you are made of stone.
Go and see About Time it's brilliant! It's got all your classic Curtis-isms with quite a few unexpected turns thrown in.
Had the loveliest day at the beach today with the loveliest @omgkatie. Lovely swim, lovely read, lovely relax...it was okay actually.
@jessackland I've done it! Shorts are on! Come on boys show me what you've got! (please don't)
So I'm hearing a lot about a transplant day...wondering if anyone wants to trade eyes or something? No? Possibly?
URGENT ANNOUNCEMENT! I might wear shorts today! For your annual fix of my pasty white legs, come to Leigh!  (Disclaimer - I might bottle it)

YES! RT @DickLeFenwick: Is this the greatest fridge ever? 
@CatKolubayev WHAT?! Not...Neville or whatever the fuck we called him! Where will he go? Aw man.
Right, just the important/useful/brilliant/clever-looking ones can come. But who to choose?? Sophie's choice.
I'm packing up my books in preparation to move - I probably shouldn't take all of them should I? Should I?! D'you think I could? Oh blimey.
@CatKolubayev Nice work mum! Looking forward to seeing the spoils!

Hosting an event. They reckon there'll be a lot of people but I'm gonna do some flyering …
@CatKolubayev We did and I'm ruddy shattered! Looking forward to a night in my own bed!
@CatKolubayev I know! I don't envy anyone having to do one of those venue get-outs! Glad to be home?
@CatKolubayev Well we shall all have a have a drink then! I know Pete'a still in The Burgh, is Ella coming down?
@CatKolubayev Amazing! He's a good lad! Is he resident in Crammond Close now then?
@CatKolubayev has Callum done this?
The last time I saw Edinburgh shrink behind me it was pretty desperate. This time I'm filled with a lovely pride and content. And Pro Plus.
Cracking last show from @LeadPencilUK this afternoon! Nostalgia-tastic brilliance. Made my day #leadpencil #EdFringe
@hayleydailily well remembered it is Sue! They're working things out and I'm learning to concentrate during the show.
@hayleydailily haha! Yep, Alan's a talkative bastard. We're having breakfast now actually which for some reason is garnering some odd looks.
The sun shines down on Edinburgh at the end of the festival like a big warm pat on the back. If nothing else we got through it eh? Bravo all
Last show done and it was bloody lovely. I'm going to bed for a million years...
@GrainneMaguire it was a proper pleasure! Telling everyone I can! If you fancy a giggle I'm in sketch group @GiraffeComedy at 1pm at Cowgate
@GrainneMaguire Saw the show again yesterday (after preview in Southend) and absolutely loved it. The Blair-as-shark picture particularly.
I've found it! Finally! Me in drink form. Mmm... 
Definitively sweaty show today. Wow. What a bloody lovely crowd though! Gonna miss this. #EdFringe #Giraffe
@eleanorkingact Amazing! Better make it a good one then eh?
@DanAntopolski Thank you mate! If you fancy a drink we'll be in the Abattoir later? Be good to have a proper chat!
@DanAntopolski I hear you were in this afternoon sir! Sorry we didn't get a chance to say hello! Did you enjoy it?
The fleeting and fickle spirit of The Fringe

Can't wait to see @joestilgoe on Monday at the Edinburgh Jazz Fest!
...so come along okay? 1pm daily at the Underbelly, Cowgate @FollowTheCow
Hey you lot! Up in Edinburgh and haven't seen @GiraffeComedy yet? Wassamatterwichew?! Here's what you're missing... #Giraffe #EdFringe
@Jimmy_Jewell @GiraffeComedy Thanks so much for coming! Really glad you enjoyed it, it was a really fun one today!
If I come back the size of a house, I entirely blame The City Cafe in Edinburgh. And haggis. I'm into haggis in a big way.
Just seen @FatSlightly. Undoubtedly my favourite so far. Just go and see it.
@JToTheSizzay you betcha!
@schierneckeretc No! Wetter than an otter's pocket.
Ugh. Edinburgh's characteristic inclement weather finally rears its sodden head. I suppose it was due. My beer's got rain in it.
Utterly fantastic show from @TerryAlderton tonight. A masterclass in surreal comedy. Almost wet myself at his sweaty genius #EdFringe
Just posted a photo 
We're taking over the asylum!! 
@hewston @sadiehasler @susanet I'm gonna have the BIG BREAKFAST with extra BIG.
@susanet YES! :)
OH YES! @sadiehasler @hewston @susanet 
@johnvoce Thanks very much! Enjoy Fiasco!
@johnvoce Darn it! Well the rest of @GiraffeComedy and I shall be there! Not too bad so far sir, in need of an early boost though!
@johnvoce @ingridoliver100 @RufusHound oooh sounds exciting! When?
@WitTank Ne'er has there been a sweatier show.
There really are some very impressive beards on show in Edinburgh this year #EdFringe
I've caught the sun a bit on my face...IN EDINBURGH! We've clearly royally fucked the planet when you need SPF at The Fringe.
Yep. Excellent choice. #DoctorWho
...or (preferably) every day at 1pm at the Underbelly on Cowgate. It's all really rather good. @FollowTheCow #EdFringe #Giraffe
If you haven't seen @GiraffeComedy at #EdFringe yet well why the hell not?! Catch us on the middle stage on the Royal Mile at 3.40...
@GabrielBisset (p.s. don't pull me up/off again)
@GabrielBisset oh that'd be lovely! Everyday except the 12th, 1pm in the Belly Laugh. Will hopefully get down to see you guys again!
@kieran_boyd Fantastic show yesterday mate! Loved it! Be lovely to have a beer if you're about?
Hey @GabrielBisset, now we've mimed oral sex next to each other, fancy coming to @GiraffeComedy in the Belly Laugh at 1pm? Naughties abound!
So...this evening I mimed pleasuring four glory holes. As you do. Thanks for that @GabrielBisset.
Yeeeep! Definitely in Edinburgh! 
@serenablossom Thanks lovely lady! Xxx
@therealcginge Thanks lovely! Xxx
If you're in Edinburgh, come on down to @GiraffeComedy at 1pm @FollowTheCow Cowgate! It's only £6 today and it's gonna be a great show!

@raypoetry @brileyriley hear hear!
@joeyhicky @OurHouseUKTour Amazing! Congratulations sir!
@DrewAspland We need to get a new Chameleon Circuit...and then break it! #wealsoneedtogethelp
@DrewAspland Right! I'll get the wood, you get the paint!
@DrewAspland I may take you up IN it! Up into the atmosphere! Through the cold and darkness to distant stars and far away worlds!
@DrewAspland Let's build one together. Share the shameful joy.
@schierneckeretc DAMN YOU SCHIERNICKER! *attempts to follow but quickly collapses in bleary eyed exhaustion*
@schierneckeretc No I mean it. We need to get you sectioned. I can barely lift my arms and stand up long enough to Vegemite my toast.
@schierneckeretc you're literally a madman.
Just so we're all clear. This is the last time in 4 weeks that I'll be up this early. #Edinburgh #neverbefore9
Well, who doesn't want those things from a sketch show? 
1-25 Aug
Underbelly Cowgate
1pm
Info and tickets:  
Finally, Broken Homes from @Ben_Aaronovitch! Loving it already! Great to be back at The Folly. 
Oh balls. Never gonna be King now am I?
@wise_judy Yeah they were really fantastic. Thanks m'love :)
Can't wait for @ntlive #MifMacbeth tonight! Sir Ken's first Shakespeare role in a decade? Yes please! Mud and blood and Thanes? Go on then!
@jessackland Fantastic. I feel like there's a certain demographic of the audience that are just coming to the shows for a kip.
Just shows the brilliant power of Twitter and its people though!
Completely gutted that the lovely @trixie was kind enough to offer me a Drowned Man ticket the night I can't go!
@Hescottburke considering I happened upon it in my fridge I'm inclined to go with option 2! Feel like it deserves a plastic cup!
@trixie you are brilliant and lovely! Thank you so much but I have a show myself tonight! Serves me right for asking! Thanks so much though!
No one has a spare ticket to The Drowned Man they don't need do they? No? Thought not.
@Hescottburke Well I've never seen the like! Should I sample it's possible delights?
All right universe, stop kidding around, what is this? 
@wise_judy Rommell?
@wise_judy I can't remember! I want to say Monty?
I miss Richard Briers.
Everyone! Stop what you're doing! Monarch of the Glen is on!
@sadiehasler I did. Now on with your column you writer!
@sadiehasler @natluurtsema did I leave my 'piece' in the tent? Got some protection money to collect later.
@sadiehasler I might go for a swim in a bit. Make a trailer so we can all prepare ourselves! Can I have a bad back teaser?
@sadiehasler @natluurtsema is a bling cap a particularly jazzy diaphragm? I hope it is.
@sadiehasler I want one! Just for me! Seriously though who did it for you?
@oldtrunktheatre well I'm very much looking forward to seeing those easy-listening-loving nuns strut their stuff!
@oldtrunktheatre that trailer's ruddy epic! I LOVE it!!
Incredibly tragic news about Paul Bhattacharjee. A great theatrical light has gone out.
@jessackland There's no space under that blanket for me anyway!
@eggfrieddog oh I know. But I'd certainly be cooler. ...or would I? I'd be Carlton from Fresh Prince wouldn't I? *sigh*
@eggfrieddog @idriselba yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I wish I was black yes yes yes yes yes
@jessackland BACKS WERE MUCH SIMPLER IN MY DAY!
@sadiehasler Bloody fools that's who!
@sadiehasler I had a very unsatisfactory doctors appointment just this morning so I don't doubt it. He didn't even slip me a finger.
@sadiehasler What...a joint one? 'cause I have trouble swigging from the same bottle as someone else...
@sadiehasler ...right. Yep. Few years to work on that eh?
@sadiehasler That would indeed be an awful shame, but we cannot hold ourselves to blame!
@sadiehasler ...messages to each others brains and complain about how slow and behind the times we all are? D'you think?)
@sadiehasler That'd be fantastic, thanks. (n.b. one day will we be old and communicating on twitter whilst the kids zap...
@sadiehasler Should've seen it coming. No amount of Foyle's War is going to numb this pain.
@sadiehasler Perhaps it has. I was bending down to retrieve a stray Werther's Original and all of a sudden, I'm the 43 I've always felt.
@oldtrunktheatre I know! How did we get here eh?
@XanderArmstrong @joestilgoe what a lovely thing!
It's happened. I've actually 'done my back in'. I was literally just bending down to get something and now I can only stand and lie. Jeez.
@howlingtwirls the whole thing, 1pm @FollowTheCow Cowgate @GiraffeComedy. What about you?
...no surprises there. PLUS, a week to do a note to say you're healthy without so much as a test to check that you are?! #Unbelievable #nhs
...thing wrong with you at a time! And apparently things that could be sorted easily a few years ago can now no longer be seen to AT ALL...
Well that was the most fantastically useless doctors appointment ever. When did it become a rule that you couldn't have more than one...
@howlingtwirls ...if you're free soon/just a good ol' catch up! You in Edinburgh this year?
@howlingtwirls Aw man! Can't believe I missed Hackney Carriage I didn't even know you were doing it! Be good to have a chat about LAMDA...
@therealcginge I know! And I'm really looking forward to it! I just want a ruddy break! On the upside, very excited about Saturday :)
All right, that's it. I need a fucking holiday. Any offers?
CANNOT WAIT to see this brilliant bugger as #Macbeth with @NTLive 
The goatee's here... 
@stejohnston love the bit when he has a good old laugh about kite surfing that tsunami! Madness! "I'm James Bloody Bond! Balls to the wall!"
@rufusjones1 £2 at a wedding last week! £2?! This, if there was ever a surer indication needed, is almost certainly the end of civilisation.
@stejohnston YES Mr Johnston!
So saddened to hear of Charlotte Brosnan's passing at the ridiculous age of 42. Just tragic. My thoughts are with my hero and his family.
@EmilySarakoppit @finborough Incredible! Congratulations! You're gonna be brilliant :)
@TheAlexSouthend Got it! Thanks lovely people!
@TheAlexSouthend Happy Saturday you guys! Think I might have left my mobile telephonic device charger upstairs, can you hold onto it for me?
@JToTheSizzay #onlyjoking #notreally #hashtag
@JToTheSizzay I'm so sorry I didn't get to see you last weekend! I miss you! On the upside, did see Joey. Would probably rather have seen u.
@Thomas_Coombes aw yeah that'd be grand! See you soon matey, feel better!
@Thomas_Coombes if you're feeling better tomorrow night, come down to @TheAlexSouthend for @GiraffeComedy
@Thomas_Coombes fair play, if there are still tickets available for other nights could you give me a shout? Yeah that'd be good :)
@Thomas_Coombes if you can but I'd I tonight if I were you! Haven't seen this one but their other shows have been unbelievable.
@Thomas_Coombes DAMN YOU! DAMN YOU COOMBES! Whatever else you've been offered, and trust me on this, you NEED to go to that show.
Answers on a postcard
...but is that all right? What should we expect from them? If anything?
The job of a theatre critic - to be objective or subjective? There are some who seem to pan everything they see without redemption...
@Ian_HughesNow thank you so much sir! Hope you're well!
@VickieDonoghue thanks Miss Donoghue! Hope you're well :) x
@LAMDAdrama Sending off my registration papers for the 3 year acting course this afternoon! Exciting!!
@wise_judy thank yooooou! Very excited! Xxx
@miahrose thanks :)
@CathBailey thank you! Hope you're well :) xx
So that's it! All signed off and ready to go! LAMDA here I come... 
@omgkatie every silver lining has a cloud...
@omgkatie WOAH! RT “@rustyrockets: Morrissey to release new concert film 
@ollygourley I haven't seen MoS yet but I've got a surprising amount of time for Superman Returns
Superlatively surprised that Bristol Old Vic &amp; LAMDA have both offered me places on their BA courses but I've got no idea which to choose!
@omgkatie oh so you're happy to receive a coffee from anyone are you? Doesn't matter who brings it?? #breakfastman #Iquit
@DrewAspland HA!
@ODEONCinemas I've booked online two tickets to The Audience in Southend tonight but can't go - is there any chance they can be returned?
@GrainneMaguire In a bid to be honest maybe we should all walk round with badges saying: 'Am I funny or just a bit depressed?'
@schierneckeretc YEEEEEAH TURKEY! TAKE THE FUCKING SHOT!!!
@schierneckeretc YAAAAAY SKYFALL!!
@MariaGuiver Gosh it makes me mad.
I'm struggling to think of anything widely accepted by society that I find more deplorable than children on national talent shows.
What? You're free tonight you say? Well come on down to @BrentwoodTheat for some larks! @GiraffeComedy are previewing our Edinburgh show!
@DrewAspland @GaysofsouthLDN Haha! I'm so happy for you!
@tomrosswilliams @NewWolsey Beautiful theatre! Enjoy &amp; break a leg!
@TylerConti1 No place yet, shortlisted for Bristol and reserve for Guildhall, 2nd recall for LAMDA coming up. Break a leg!
@TylerConti1 tell me about it mate. What've you got left?
Getting ready for tonight...@GiraffeComedy 
Here's the link for tickets, get your beaming face along if you can 
Hi all, tomorrow night my sketch group @GiraffeComedy are previewing our Edinburgh show @BrentwoodTheat. It'd be lovely to see you there!
Check it out @omgkatie! RT @greg_jenner: Our #HorribleHistories homage to Charles Dickens and The Smiths  
If you do nothing else this weekend see @GiraffeComedy on Friday @BrentwoodTheat. You won't regret it! ...unless you bring young children.
I definitely think @GiraffeComedy should take a working trip to the zoo. There's loads of material here!! Thanks @BristolZooGdns!
Here's where you get your tickets and that 
Hilarious sketch trio @GiraffeComedy are back this Friday! Brentwood Theatre, 7th June, 8pm, £8. Be there or go spare!
Anyone know of any really, REALLY good dry cleaners in London? Bit urgent. Asking for a friend.
@MarkValencia I refuse to see anything in 3D now when I can avoid it. Loved Star Trek though, despite nothing flying at my face.
@eggfrieddog @ben_aaronovitch Do you like them? Can't wait for the next Rivers of London!
KHAAAAAAN!!!!!
*Warning! Warning! Incoming Spoiler!*
@alexthorpe12 Played Richard a couple of yrs ago - loved it! Those plays are a mad brilliant bloody rollercoaster. Where are you doing them?
@serenablossom Never blame yourself when you can blame The Mail. Did they spoil Wednesday's Mad Men? Didn't think they reviewed good tele.
@serenablossom double whammy! Ouch.

@omgkatie I enjoy that until the imaginary responsibility gets too much for me and I end up crashing the bally thing. In my mind.
I like the Docklands Light Railway because sometimes I feel like I'm in Gotham City.
@WitTank thanks for a great night again last night gents! See you funny bastards in Edinburgh hopefully!
@GrainneMaguire Brilliant preview last night in Southend! Loved all the politics material, looking forward to seeing it again at the fringe!
@SammyWarrens Do, I think you'd like it. I know I know I must! You don't have a spare weekend going that I could borrow do you?
@SammyWarrens @bbcluther DAMN RIGHT IT IS! Did you see The Fall the other night? That was good. Iplaya! I miss your faces x
@Thomas_Coombes we're putting a little summer tour together and we'll have the details up soon sir! Be lovely if you could come along!
This, ladies and gentlemen, is how I shall be spending my summer. You comin' or what? 
@Ian_HughesNow Hey that's almost a pint there!
Just to confirm, who is Alex Fergumsun?
@DrewAspland I blame you for nothing, Aspland. Who could say they wouldn't do the same?
@DrewAspland I take it you swiftly had them murderer?
@SammyWarrens Urgh. Humans.
@howlingtwirls yeah, ultimately some brilliant drama. Really disappointed itv have asked for more though. Sigh.
@howlingtwirls What did you think? #Broadchurch
@omgkatie RT “@BroadchurchSlug: Can't believe I was living under the same roof as the murderer. #Broadchurch”
...of that brilliance rubs off.
...the world has ever seen. So Happy Birthday mate. As this same sun shines down on us as it did on you, let's hope a little...
...not pay his taxes, have a pint and go to bed not knowing he'd one day be hailed as the greatest, most human, most insightful artists...
And man who could have a think, sit down and write the words 'To Be or Not To Be', be the first person to use the word 'upstairs'...
Where the skies cleared and the sun shone down to give and take life from one of the world's greatest ever sons.
It's rumoured that Shakey was born and died on the same day and I'd like to think it was a day like this.
Right, plug done, here's a thought...
It's Shakespeare's 449th birthday today! Why not celebrate with Othello at The Palace Theatre? @SouthendTheatre it's gonna be a great show!
@joeleat Boom! That was amazing. As was 'and I know there's a part of you you haven't seen in years' - Joan
This week's Mad Men, The Conspirators, mostly featured WOMEN BEING AWESOME! YES!!!
Sorry I know that's a fairly vapid statement but seriously, in every room of the house?!
People bloody love a feature wall don't they? Sigh.

@DrewAspland No that's waaaay too far fetched! And why?!
@DrewAspland and the bees are disappearing
BE THERE RT@GiraffeComedy: Just incase you've been living under a rock we're previewing our Edinburgh show tonight @TheAlexSouthend 7.30 £5
Help.
Please do give my sketch comedy group @GiraffeComedy a follow. Or else they'll make me kiss you. OR WORSE, they won't allow me to kiss you.
@offcutfestival @smoothfacedgent spontaneity #offcutroots
Apart from making a darn good breakfast, @TheAlexSouthend are hosting @GiraffeComedy on Friday, so come along why don'tcha? 7.30pm, £5.
Saw the utterly stunning Midsummer Night's Dream @BristolOldVic last night, beautiful production by Tom Morris and @handspringcc. Must see!
@JToTheSizzay Yay! Cheers! How was it?
@omgkatie sorry! In my mind...all wrapped up! ...In cling film!!
@omgkatie nope. I can see you! In my mind. Naked.
@omgkatie Helloooo! *lights fire*
Editing the sketches together this evening! 'citing! 
He'll be sorely missed. Next time I hear a phone go off in a performance, I'm going apeshit in tribute. RIP.
Oh Richard Griffiths. One of those few actors whose performances could seem giant and epic and simultaneously delicate and heartbreaking.
@DrewAspland @automaticdoor LURKING JUST BEYOND OUR REACH BEHIND THE CLOUDS OF COMPREHENSION.
@omgkatie #Ido
@omgkatie When you become the man darling we'll watch the programmes you want to watch. #I'mafeministreally
@omgkatie woohoo! What use our holidays, Katie, if we cannot watch the shows we love? #RipperStreet
@omgkatie Don't you mean Ripper Street and West Wing marathon hols tomorrow?
@omgkatie Stop worshipping the devil and sucking the lifeblood from innocent babes and it may depart you. That or vitamin C and REST!
Follow @GiraffeComedy or I'll carve out your soul and sit in your heart. Or something like that. Maybe not that. But something like it.
@MrThomasHescott it's a doozie. I've got my theory.
@IncredibleSuit Could give you my guy's number? He's fang-tastic.
@automaticdoor Ah the human vanity of being half reassured and half disappointed by that fact.
@omgkatie all right I won't pretend. I did not love it.
I'd rather have the silent treatment than the R'n'B treatment.
Lovely funny day today filming with @GiraffeComedy. Can't wait to see what it all looks like!
@howlingtwirls HOW?!?
@Kim_Scopes @pleasance Sounds brilliant! See you there! I'm up with @GiraffeComedy
@Kim_Scopes @boris_sergey Are you guys back in Edinburgh this year?
@jessackland Mmm-h-mmm. Classic. 
@jessackland Yeah I can hook you up.
@jessackland Nice. Real nice. Mmm.
@jessackland That's the power of a pod suit. What was it like Jess?
@Lynn_Shepherd Brill. Looking forward to it! But first, the murder of Abigail Cass...
@Lynn_Shepherd Am I going to be okay with A Treacherous Likeness knowing next to nothing about the Shelleys?
@Lynn_Shepherd Check out Single Father or his RSC Hamlet if you can, both very good. Still reading T-A-L's by the way, really enjoying it!
@Lynn_Shepherd Whaddoyoumeean?! Always thought he's consistently brilliant.
@MrThomasHescott @mrsamuelbarnett I love it the mostest! God I wish I was just a tiny bit more like David Tennant.
This is @GiraffeComedy in action. Podcasty goodness. Listen if you want, if you don't you're dead to me. No biggie. 


Hopefully.
A sketch comedy group what I write/speak in is doing out first gig @TheAlexSouthend on Fri 12th April, please do come, 'sgonna be well good.
Very excited to be seeing SHSB's production of Phantom of the Opera directed by the brilliant @MarkValencia tonight!
@oldtrunktheatre FUCK that looks incredible! Where did you find it??
@DrewAspland Good! (Knowing response) Very soon I think, gonna announce the first gig when it's all properly signed off :) 'citing!!
@DrewAspland Ta boyo! Are you good? (Leading question)
Please give @GiraffeComedy a follow its my sketch group with the lovely @Ali_James22 and the absentee John Frost. Frankly we need the mates.
When Ewoks do it, that must be the cutest sex ever mustn't it?
Whatever it is I bet it's funny RT @GiraffeComedy: If we can get 20 followers today we'll upload something very special!!

(n.b. Not a picture of any of our body part ...
@fentonstevens very glad to hear it! Are you heading down to the south east?
Obviously a Friday it ain't but please do follow the marvellous @GiraffeComedy, a sketch group I'm in. We've got exciting news coming!
@fentonstevens pleasure! How's the tour going?
@rednoseday 
@EmilySarakoppit Like!
@SSC_2013 I thought it might be. About time too! X
@SSC_2013 I was wondering just this afternoon when we were going to join! Welcome!
@russell_kane Well done again last night sir! Really brilliant, hilarious and brave show. Hope you had a lovely dinner afterwards :)
@wittertainment Are you going to be doing any more theatre soon? Wish I could've seen your much acclaimed Macbeth at the Everyman.
In aid of International Women's Day, I'm spending the day being more kind, reasonable and empathic. Feelings are a right arse ache too. #IWD
Stale. I think I'm thinking of stale.
Can a muffin be simultaneously moist and dry? #theimportantquestions
@omgkatie Glad to hear it! #properfood
@JosephBader08 dammit! Should've taken a picture of my thai red chicken curry soup as well! It's in me belly now #oops
@JosephBader08 We girls have got to stick together in our food pride y'know
Not really a poster of food pictures but this sandwich is pretty epic even if I do say so myself. 
@incrediblesuit Whaddoyouthink?
@IncredibleSuit This is bad news right? For a sec thought we could return to the days of a continuing director who we know cld do a gr8 job
@c2c_Rail Is the passenger okay?
@TylerConti1 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! Go out and get yourself a badge, have a 99, climb a small hill and knit a scarf it's your birthday!!
@laurynredding been meaning to for ages, just ordered it from Amazon!
@Carpetrider Sick
@Ryan_Taylor_ Agreed! Isn't technology grand when it isn't being used to start the apocalypse?
@Carpetrider Rarely do I 'lolz' much on my own but this did prompt several chortles. It's the streetest I'll ever be. Does it do German?
@laurynredding #doubletick how amazing is Olivia Coleman?

RETWEET THE SHIT OUT OF THIS, PEOPLE!!
Look @omgkatie!! RT @DrewAspland: I drew Pope Morrissey @8bitnitwit 
@automaticdoor Oh Rudy. Should've listened. Could've made something of yeself.
Spooky.
T'other night I dreamt that after cleaning out a small cupboard in my room, I discovered a tunnel that led to a old theatre having a seance.
@automaticdoor And he spent time inside before eventually becoming a social worker? Offering other kids similarly general advice?
@automaticdoor Perhaps his reputation was irrevocably damaged by all the problems he created in town.
@Waterstones Tom All Alone's by Lynn Shepherd. Brilliant Bleak House inspired mystery. The devil is in the detail! 
'The fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.' - John le Carré
Heaven! RT @EverymansLib: Look what we've just spotted in @WaterstonesPicc! Lovely. 
#sleeping #onesie #bracelet #photo #hashtag 
@TheRSC Incredibly excited that Michael Pennington has joined the cast of Richard II! Can't wait!
My first lie in in ages feels so delicious I might string it out until tomorrow. But first, scrambled eggs...
@DickLeFenwick BOOM!
@JosephBader08 Yes! For the last few years it's just seemed like lines that anyone could be saying. Maybe we should do it? Fresh blood?
@JosephBader08 Good fun actually. Its good to have a bit of personality up there. Like Crystal used to have!
@JosephBader08 The hosting has become very sanitised though hasn't it?
@JosephBader08 Well the Lazenby comparison can be read many ways my friend. OHMSS is one of my favourites...
@SmoothFacedGent @edfringe Yeah #Titus or #RichardII definitely
Best reading chair ever. 
@oldtrunktheatre he was a good sort wasn't he?
@DrewAspland quite all right dear heart!
@DrewAspland Happy Birthdayday! Why not celebrate by eating a maze and then getting lost in an apple turnover?
@Ellen_Gibbons She ruddy did! I think I knew it, but to have it put that way has totes blown my mind. I wanna spend 3hrs with her every day.
That's just what I think anyway. #discuss
That's why I think it's important to train. To be aware of yourself so you can be a blank canvas again.
And until we learn to control those, we can't really do much without layering it with a subtext we barely know is there.
As actors, the individual habits that we all carry around with us convey a world of information that we aren't even aware of.
'Why am I here?' #questionsIhaveaskedatworktoday
'D'you think trousers are completely necessary?' #questionsIhaveaskedatworktoday
'So, who's everyones favourite Teletubbie?' #questionsIhaveaskedatworktoday
Crisp air, warm sun falling on landmarks and shining off tall glass. London looks its best on days like this.
On the upside ladies and gents it's a gorgeous day in the capital.
Luckily no copies of @TheSunNewspaper in my immediate vicinity on the train so no tearing of shameful rags from ignorant grips just yet.
We should all be embarrassed of it really. I want to rip it from commuter's hands and ask them why they buy the awful picture book.
Sorry I know we're all talking about the same thing this morning but it's so very important that the shame of that front page is realised.
#HerNameWasReevaSteenkamp and she was a woman with a heart and a mind, dreams and parents. We must not exploit her image to sell papers.
Wodehouse, again, being utterly brilliant.
'The drowsy stillness of the afternoon was shattered by what sounded to his trained senses like G. K. Chesterton falling on a sheet of tin.'
'Unseen, in the background, Fate was quietly slipping lead into the boxing-glove' - Wodehouse, putting it better than anyone else.
@kirsty_oswald Just saw you in Dancing on the Edge! Amazing! Well done :)
@TylerConti1 Well done this morning old boy - another great show!
@DrewAspland it's never too late.


@therealcginge @sadiehasler @hewston @thebigbowwow this seems arbitrary. I refuse to believe Oakes is the tallest Bastard.
Yet another helpful and instructive toilet message 
@therealcginge I am! Can't wait! They're all good thanks, how's Bastards?
Course if that's not it, there's going to be a few embarrassed cow-horse adulterers this morning. 'I knew it! He doesn't even look like me!'
Seems like the only plausible explanation to me and if that is the case, what are you all fucking moaning about?!
WAIT!! Wait. What if there is actually no such thing as 'beef'? And cows are just another species of horse?
Off to take pictures for something very exciting! Watch this space!
@I_GregoryPorter
@Ali_James22 I think you're going to learn to really like it...
@sadiehasler I like it 'cause it's got Pierce, ham and nuns in. That's my kind of sandwich right there.

@ChrisHewitt lucky, lucky Chris Hewitt.
@DickLeFenwick a crying shame!
@CollinsRosie Come on Wales!!! (Which one is #6nations again?)
@sadiehasler *hic* Zzzzzzz....
@sadiehasler Dribble.
@sadiehasler n.b. 'recline' on the kitchen floor. Better. Recliiiiine. Mmm. Yes.
@sadiehasler *whilst desperately scoffing* ok ok! Look no hands! All gone. Now I sit on the kitchen floor in a salad cream-induced stupor.
@sadiehasler right? But where do you stop? That's the problem.
Tell me I'm wrong but the best food to walk into your house at 00.00 and find in the fridge is cold new potatoes and salad cream right?
@ollygourley @serenablossom Like sexy Father Christmases. Or ghosts.
@serenablossom @ollygourley I wasn't interviewed either. You must be REALLY confused. Sure it's Heat you're reading and not an old Echo?
@michaellegge You're never along when you've got bags and bags of money and a beautiful family and career...right?
Is it too early to be feeling like, as a person with a face, I've peaked?
Undoubtedly the most thorough instructions I've ever seen in a toilet 
I think one should always see acting as more of a game and less of a test.
Val Doonican would never have stood for it.
Tina Turner not much better.
Sheryl Crow a particularly heinous culprit.
Watching some old clips has made me realise just how rife lip-synching was in mid-90s Top of the Pops.
@DrewAspland mmm-mmm. Dirty dipper.
That was quintessential dandy and courtier to the Queen Hardy Aimes by the way.
Great words to dress by: “A man should look as if he bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care, then forgot about them.”
Well if the stress &amp; physical strain of doing Panto doesn't kill me surely slipping on a custard pie &amp; breaking my back will #fingerscrossed
@serenablossom It's always top of my list of things to do. Thank you! I think this is what the end of the world looks like...
@serenablossom I *did* Bluewater this evening and spent 80% of it drinking coffee followed by an intensive shopping dash. Now, traffic. Grr.
Urgh. I am not one of life's natural shoppers.
@jackshalloo What are you doing?
@VickieDonoghue Yay Leigh! Hope you're well x
@jackshalloo tell me about it! 17 this week! Panto?
'As in life, so in a game of hazard, skill will make something of the worst of throws.'

@omgkatie I really must! Is it super good?
@omgkatie WANT
@CathBailey @baz_productions I know it all sounds really exciting! We must have a beer and a proper catch up soon!
That's morning one done of getting soaked, covered in pie mix and black makeup! Roll on this afternoon!
@odgeson Are they Victorian urchins?
@naz_osmanoglu Flossing and thinking of you...
@WitTank Thank you guys for such a brilliant show! Really loved it!
@hewston @sadiehasler Thank you very much and goodnight!
@sadiehasler @hewston Haven't you read page 510? It very clearly states none of the above applies if you look stonking in a safari suit.
@sadiehasler @hewston Style doesn't pander to your health and safety whims Hasler!
@sadiehasler @hewston Enough peer pressure guys I've already got them on!! Flares and a jacket with lapels you could fly a plane with.
@hewston Well fuck it I feel like its my civic duty now! How about tie dye? Maybe not. One step at a time eh?
@hewston You think so? Trousers are getting very skinny these days. It's all about expansion and contraction. Like the universe I suppose.
@sadiehasler Ah nostalgia. *Looks nostalgically into middle distance whilst smoking overly large pipe*
@hewston Haha! Alas, all my wicker and flares got lost in that warehouse fire in '86. Thank goodness.
@sadiehasler Ain't it? A good old fashioned family past time! Like singing around the gramophone or latent racism.
Well if Roger Moore can't do double denim, I don't know who can. 
@sadiehasler Absolutely none. Unless snot protest or lynching ('stringing' also advised).
@sadiehasler I like to think I'm efficient in my tantrums. That's always how it was with mother; a quick smack and she'd get the message.
@sadiehasler Well if you try to repress me and my shapes in what I took to be a very exciting electrical section that's what'll happen!
@sadiehasler I'll actually take any excuse to put my hands on my hips and gyrate in public.
@sadiehasler It's one of my personal favourites
@DrewAspland You should become an actor. You can work in the service industry for 50 years and it'll always be temporary.
@sadiehasler Macarena?
@CathBailey Very well thanks! How are you? How's married life? And @love39steps?
@JToTheSizzay If there's one thing my time as Southend's Youth Mayor proved, it's that neither they nor I knew what the fuck we were doing.

@eggfrieddog Reading @Ben_Aaronovitch's Rivers of London series at the moment and absolutely loving it. Sped through two in about ten days.
@eggfrieddog Sold! I'm getting one for her and one for me!
@eggfrieddog Dare I ask what it's about?
@MrThomasHescott @bowdaisyd @nytofgb Brilliant news! Couldn't have happened to a finer gentleman congratulations!
@eggfrieddog ...Francis from Made in Chelsea has a book? On what?! My girlfriend would be super excited too. Might have to come down! <WRAPPED PRESENT>
@eggfrieddog Ooh who ya got? We had Michael Palin next door the other week I was so excited!!
Sad news about Dave Brubeck, one of the most brilliant jazz men to have lived. Improvising wasn't the same before or after him.
@Markgatiss Me too! Utterly brilliant! As darlingly directed as many of the others should have been. Jeremy Brett on fine form!
@stejohnston Break a leg! Sorry I can't be along to see it Buttons! Hope you're well x
Would love to see Homes Under the Hammer Horror - Peter Cushing goes to a suburban semi and covers the walls in blood.

@omgkatie Go on then, eject me! See if I care!
Come see! ...with a child... RT @SouthendTheatre: @georgekemp Pirate Pandemonium! 
I like you better without your Beretta.
...at the Dixon Studio @SouthendTheatre on the 22nd of December. Do remember to bring a child though. Otherwise it'll just get weird.
It's going to be AAAAARRR-mazing! If you can't make it, you can catch Capt. Ben Fleet &amp; the gang in @OutloudProd's Pirate Pandemonium...
This evening I shall swashbuckling my way down Leigh Broadway as a massive pirate for the tuning on of the lights. Do come and enjoy!
@eggfrieddog Starring my boy Pierce!
@Tonygardner it really is frightfully good. Well done!
@eleanorkingact I think that was mainly you and @TylerConti1 but we did!
@eleanorkingact Must've been @OutloudProd Well done again this morning! See you soon!
For goodness sake sign this please 
These are my absolute favourite days, bright and crisp and delicious. Happy Friday all!
@BrentwoodLDG Really great to be a part of this week. Spread the word!! Hope you 'enjoyed' the show!
@ScotchHunter What's your favourite of Jura's expressions range? Yet to try any others but currently enjoying lightly peated Superstition.
@DrewAspland Anchors away! 1 large barrel of rum for me please.
@DrewAspland Drowning in a sea of savoury thins Andrew. Make of that what you will.
@omgkatie Oh hi boooooots.
Twitter's very fucking swear-y tonight isn't it? My bad. Schtum.
In other news, I've got a big glass of single malt in one hand and a good book in the other. What the fuck have you got?
Why can you literally not stop once you've popped a delicious one-just-isnt-ruddy-enough tube? Eh?!
All right, what the fuck is it with Pringles? Do they actually put crack in them? Are they cursed? Are they made by magical moorish pixies?
Mundane generic tweet alert! MUNDANE GENERIC TWEET ALERT!
@Ben_Aaronovitch Really loving Rivers of London! Big crime reader so it's very exciting to happen upon something fresh &amp; fun. Hooked!
Musical Instruments Movie Poster Mashups: 
@omgkatie pahahahahahaha!
@Amy_J_Wilson Was it on the Beeb? Was he presenting?? Did he look dreamy???
@Amy_J_Wilson WHAAAAAAA?!?
@TheStuartWilde Amazing!! I do that all the time without the impetus of a challenge.
@stejohnston You've taken over the memory of several musicals in my mind too Mr Johnston. And The Hangover! Looking forward to Skyfall?
@JToTheSizzay I'm on the train too by the way!
@JToTheSizzay Hahaha love that. There is no text notification noise more appropriate for your mobile communications device. Hilarious!
'I wish I was more...what's the word...this is ironic...oh God...umm......ARTICULATE! Wow.' said @omgkatie this evening, ironically.
Just did an accidental sick on all @omgkatie's records though.
It's okay peeps, @omgkatie was just 'joking' (for some reason?!). My Rog mag's all good! You can get on with your days.
@omgkatie Haha! That IS good! X
@TheStuartWilde HA HA! Touché sir!
@TheStuartWilde I've never been so aroused in my life.
Does the Shadow Transport Secretary have the native american name 'Rare Eagle'? Or did I just mis-hear?
@AliceER818 Oh God no! This bad boy'll run and run.
@AliceER818 Naa it'll be fine. It's been through lots of expansions and contractions like this. Keeping it fresh is good!
@AliceER818 Well the silence thought they'd got rid of him and I think now he's getting rid of traces of himself to keep a low profile
@AliceER818 Whaddyamean?
@AliceER818 nope, pretty much from Rory getting on that ledge I was gone <CRYING FACE>
@AliceER818 I think that's fair enough. A good, clean break. And just a really well written/acted ep. I did a big blub.
@AliceER818 Yeah, a bit of a return to form in my opinion. A very fitting send off!
@AliceER818 It's ever so good isn't it?
Saw the absolutely stunning @joestilgoe this evening at @606club. Brilliant night! An amazing musician and an utterly charming fellow!
@Amy_J_Wilson Of bloody course!
@Hescottburke @mrthomashescott Congratulations to you both you lovely gents!
@omgkatie Oh right! Well I could do that I guess. Is it set in the west country or do you just enjoy the bumpkin innocence of their voice?
@omgkatie You've got a terrific west country accent!
@omgkatie I'll do it! Would you care for any particular voice?

@omgkatie actually he stopped doing those last year after he accidentally sowed 'Made at the Vagican' in one. Sounds like a lady product.
@omgkatie A tie made of diamonds.
@omgkatie Noooo! I'd never steal a suit! They're sacred. Plus they do a count at the end of the day. Twas a measly little accessory!
@Hescottburke Oh alright!! You've worn me down. It's nice operating in the shadowy grey area between morality and menswear.
@Hescottburke ...then mark it as damaged and take it again. Good job this is a PM eh!
@Hescottburke Alright. I suppose I could count it as uniform. And I may well give it back at some point in the distant future...
@Hescottburke Oh no I always keep those! You always need a keepsake! No it was a belt from the shop I work in. I forgot to remove it!
Today I accidentally stole something from my place of work. Does it still count as stealing if it's accidental? Should I keep it?
@AliceER818 Definitely is the one.
@AliceER818 OOOOOOOOMG
@AliceER818 OMG I KNOW!

@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson Can I play? 
@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson I've got the route on my phone but it's RM4 1HP
@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson 'A bridge too far' by David Farr. Far out.
@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson A live chicken.
@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson itsy teeney bitsy weeney Dennis Waterman in the Sweeney
@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson Up to you guys. About 12 maybe?
@Amy_J_Wilson That, Syria, all of it. Seems like a nastier place than usual at the moment. 'Help us Shakespeare!' - 'I cometh to save thee!'
That wasn't an actual to him by the way, just an exclamation. Terrifying the amount of awful things happening.
@MrScottHazell @howlingtwirls just be pant and be sick it'll be fine!
Jesus the world's going to hell today.
@howlingtwirls @mudlarkstheplay @bushtheatre Woop! So exciting! Well done all, so deserved @VickieDonoghue @MrScottHazell
@EmilySarakoppit Aw man I was pleased with that! Fun guy's rubbish. RUBBISH!
@EmilySarakoppit They used to ask that shit all the time! Okay, I'd be a tomato 'cause I taste best when I'm hot and I'm very good for you!
@EmilySarakoppit Ps of course I'm not Ibiza but I'd never go on Blind Date! I'd be Stratford upon Avon or something. Exciting!
@EmilySarakoppit haha that's amazing! Again again! A great night out for me is a few drinks with mates, what's your ideal night out?
@EmilySarakoppit If I was a holiday destination I'd be Ibiza, where would you be?
@omgkatie @kaneryanthomas @amy_j_wilson I dids it! I'm a good specker!
@omgkatie @kaneryanthomas @amy_j_wilson Ruddy am! I wrote that ruddy scene! With a bic pen not a quill like in all them pictures. On my bed.
@omgkatie @kaneryanthomas @amy_j_wilson You can't put me off!! The truth is...I AM  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE!
@kaneryanthomas @amy_j_wilson @omgkatie You guys are mean! I'm gonna put you all off loads on Saturday!
@omgkatie @kaneryanthomas @amy_j_wilson *Holds out gruel bowl expectantly*
@omgkatie @kaneryanthomas @amy_j_wilson Please sir, may I have some gin?
@MrThomasHescotty My pleasure, it needs sharing.
Really interesting article by @MrThomasHescott on theatre engaging community audiences. Give it a read 
@roseimogen *aw man
@roseimogen Aw men! I spent weeks searching for headdresses and never found one and there it is! Bugger. Guess I'll have to do it again eh?
@CathBailey Have you read this? Thoughts? RT @guardianstage: Are Shakespeare's women second-class citizens? 
@omgkatie The car I'm 'driving' is actually being pushed behind me and that was genuinely pretty funny actually.
@omgkatie Utter hilarity from start to finish! Especially funny was the whole 'screaming for help into the freezing night' bit.
@omgkatie Thanks! The driving was my second favourite thing after slow motion running.
@omgkatie Only if you want to! Obviously you don't have to. #itsabitofadowner
@omgkatie Just found the Network rail thing again, 'av a gander 
@hayleyevenett @amy_j_wilson @omgkatie @aliceeryan Leaving the house now is not 'the one'.
@Amy_J_Wilson @aliceer818 @omgkatie 8ish?
@omgkatie @amy_j_wilson @aliceer818 I'm totally in x
@omgkatie Oh me too...that's why it's only basically the same...yep.
Basically the same as @omgkatie getting her hair doneRT @theniftyfifties: Photo: Marilyn has her hair done on the phone 
I shall be going, shall you? RT @Whatsonstage: News: Roger Rees returns to West End with one-man What You Will, 18 Sep 
@JToTheSizzay Oooooooh yes. Where's my theatrical trailer?! They're showing something at Comic Con today I think
@Tonygardner And I suppose we should be grateful for any improvement however slight. Good luck tomorrow!
Hang on, the turn out in @EquityUK elections was 12%?! Shocking.
@VoteMalcolm2012 Congratulations!
@omgkatie #letmegetwhatIwant
@EmilySarakoppit Represent!
@EmilySarakoppit Good speech right?
@CathBailey @exitthelemming An incredible rallying cry. Thank you!
I can't urge you all to read this strongly enough, Sam West's speech from
Shift Happens last week. So important. 
@omgkatie Good stuff! Just make it up it'll be fine :) something about the painéd impotent? Nunnight! Xx
@omgkatie Pop the ice in a Brokeback Mountain and soda and eeeeverything'll be fine! See you tomorrow! X
@omgkatie Don't even think about it! It needs to be a big one, I'm willing to sacrifice my face for my art!! *looks into insuring face*
@omgkatie To Hunker Down: 	'to settle in at a location for an extended period'. And you're going to slap me 5 times this week anyway!
@omgkatie Pop a drama on and hunker down! Well I shall know never to deny you a day off!
@omgkatie That's not the truth...is it? Yeah the iplayer app :)
@omgkatie The app woman the app! How come?
@omgkatie The Radio 4 advice didn't work then?
Thoroughly enjoyed The Newsroom tonight. Sorkin a genius. Theres just something about watching incredibly clever people work their bums off.
@AliceER818 Ooh I like the library one very much!
@stejohnston I'll pretend you didn't say that!
@AliceER818 What are your other thoughts?
@AliceER818 We love a bit of Lansbury! Have a listen to Imelda Staunton as well, can't do much better to my mind :)
@AliceER818 Yeah the film's okay, look on YouTube for clips of the show though :)
@AliceER818 LOOK at him! Look at HIM! Just look. And then look a bit more. And when you think you're finished looking, take one last look.
@AliceER818 ...and I'm sure you're much better than you think you are!
@AliceER818 Don't worry you'll be absolutely fine. As long as you act through it they'll enjoy it. Not everyone there'll be great singers...
@AliceER818 If only we were all a bit more like Shatner. The world'd be a far better place...
@AliceER818 Yeah it's in a similar vein really, By the Sea's a bit more standalone though and I think you can do more with it. Good luck!
@HayleyKasper to which Liverpool erupted, 'George isn't even in me! He's in Essex, you need to tell him that. I don't even like him.'
@EmilySarakoppit No one should read it!
@SammyWarrens Ithangyou!
@SammyWarrens no! TUESday!
@EmilySarakoppit I think the worst thing might be it being called 'necessary reading'. Like softcore porn being 'necessary watching'. Blurgh
@HayleyKasper 'Hello!' ...replied Liverpool
@EmilySarakoppit Bleurgh.
@AliceER818 'By the Sea' from Sweeney Todd. Think you'd be brilliant at it, no really tough or prolonged notes and you'd be very funny :)
@AliceER818 Gosh now you're asking. Hmm...you want something quite wordy that you can act through I think. So I would heartily recommend...
@DrewAspland I'm sure you'll be fine!
@DrewAspland Ready to smite those beneath with furious natural selection. Actually, this is probably making you more nervous isn't it?
@DrewAspland A good thing in our languid nonchalant modern society. People aren't panic-y enough these days. The Blitz! That was good panic.
@DrewAspland I think you'd miss the daily imminent threat were it gone.
@JToTheSizzay Swoon RT @007: Sean Connery’s tux from DR. NO by Anthony Sinclair (1962) on show at #Designing007 
@JToTheSizzay I feel even a valiant attempt to suit up in the presence of THE suits might seem impetuous at best, can't face that firepower.
@JToTheSizzay Right? RT @007: Sanchez’s shark - maimed Felix Leiter in LICENCE TO KILL (1989) - see it at #Designing007 
@JToTheSizzay Don't even start, I've been wetting myself for weeks. We're going right? THEY'VE GOT THE SUITS!!! Follow @007
@alhimself @spritetheatre Lovely! Well enjoy your last couple of days :)
@alhimself @spritetheatre It looks, if nothing else, very entertaining. Who've you been playing?
@omgkatie @aliceer818 No!! ...no...
@omgkatie @aliceer818 I have no choice now, it's out of my hands.
@alhimself @spritetheatre Just had a look at the website. That's quite the moustache you're sporting sir!
@AliceER818 @omgkatie Oh gosh. A genuine accident appears to have occurred. 
@howlingtwirls Did you accidentally go into the ladies? This is how I imagine they all look.
@kaneryanthomas What you doing over the weekend?
@winstanleyphoto My pleasure! Hope you're well alternative photographic version of Heather!
@omgkatie ...don't really. I'll cry.
@omgkatie Well isn't that spiffing! Have a lovely time! You can buy glasses for everyone so we can all look like Timmy Mallett/Austin Powers
@omgkatie Score! Whatcha gonna do with your free afternoon?
Need new headshots? @winstanleyphoto offering affordable headshots in London. Discounts for students &amp; graduates. Taking bookings now.
Eric Sykes backstage whilst doing Dick Whittington in Bath, 1984. Photo by Simon Annand. RIP 
Very sad to hear of Eric Sykes' passing. Such a concrete part of the comedy landscape in this country it's odd to think he's gone. RIP.
@Ian_HughesNow I did exactly the same thing last night. Great programme, great album. Dance like nobody's watching Mr Hughes!
Fascinating and touching piece on Paul Simon's Graceland on BBC tonight. Just the best album. Beautiful &amp; moving &amp; incredible to dance to.
@howlingtwirls @youngvictheatre Oh gosh, sorry. *Walks off and slams door to the street so Will can hear it this time*
@howlingtwirls @youngvictheatre Were you talking/weeing/leaving?
@crateoflearning 'Mamma, just killed an auditionee...'
@crateoflearning Do they make you want to break free? (Sorry)
@TylerConti1 YES! BRUUUUUUV! Nice work dude
@omgkatie Not better than Pierce! I'd like to see them shout 'Donna' from a rock in the middle of the sea! Did you watch the football?
@omgkatie haha I actually watched a bit of Mamma Mia on itv2! Which is pretty much the same thing right? Am now on Richard II.
@howlingtwirls Ah! Well that's as good an excuse as any! I shall lend you the book soon
@howlingtwirls Insomnia and Radio4Extra I'm afraid. What was your excuse?
@howlingtwirls Love the music as well. And Hayley Atwell. It's very good I'd recommend it, a similar effect for me.
@howlingtwirls Stunning series. Oh I cried. Have you read the book?
Just watched the brilliant Psychobitches from Playhouse Presents. Thoroughly recommend if you can catch it. Piaf was my particular favourite
Tringelbert Wangledack?
Slut Bunwalla?
Dindlebert Zindledack?
Engelbert Humperdinck?
Benedict ...
@VoteMalcolm2012 That's quite alright! Good luck! #Equity #VoteMalcolm
@DrewAspland ...yeeeees...
@DrewAspland I like my coffee like I like my men...
