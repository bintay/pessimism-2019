If three months of your pay can only afford you a small ring, you need a new job.

I'm just so happy that God revealed the fake...
But let me get ready for work.
We good over here.!
There's never been a conflict unresolved and there never will be.
Actually having somebody that wants fix and work through things is a great feeling. I hate a boy that likes to drag and dwell on issues.
I've grown up so much these past 6 months due to spirituality and him.
So blessed to have a man that talks everything out, even the hardest of topics.
A child points fingers, an adult mans up to their mess...
I hate a person that always has to bring up your differences to make a point. Obviously you're not as mature as you think.?
Even the smallest amount of positive growth, is still growth.!
Can't have a decent convo with a bitter person. Always trynna throw things in your face...
You can't say you've forgiven if you're still bringing it up in every convo...
I've encountered some of the most bitter, can't let stuff go people lately..
It's okay, be mad or whatever but don't let that dictate the rest of your life...
Wonder if I'll wake up at 10 if I fall asleep now
<DOG FACE><DOG FACE><DOG FACE> ruff ruff
I'm glad that he notices that we encourage and push each other towards greatness.! Actual #RelationshipGoals
Gotta help @FreeTr1p pack this weekend.

Like "So when you go to the store, don't forget to get me a shirt." And then she accidentally says yes &amp; there are no take backs in life!
I talk about situations like they're happening point blank, so my mom has no choice but to say yes.
I have nothing to talk about though.
My mom acts like I care that she's at work... I'm Trynna talk now
My strategy is that I'll annoy him enough that he'll buy it. Always works on my mom and granddad. <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><DOG FACE><CREDIT CARD>

Ugh I can't wait until I move.
The people at this orthodontist are super friendly.
I hate that my brother got all his stuff done early in life with my mom by his side and I have to do it all alone.
@MrsFreakDericka in Akron at larox depends on the location of the piercing but full price for the first and the others price of jewelry
Now that summer break is to start, to start picking up over time or not to... Hmmm
I wanna go back and get those other 3 piercings... I'm obsessed now
Ugh people have no common sense <WEARY FACE>
She gun look at me n say can I sit here. Don't you see my feet resting here girl ? She's like I'm sorry I'll go sit over there...
Then ole girl gun try to sit on the couch I'm laying on... Like there aren't 5 other chairs to sit <UNAMUSED FACE>
We have absolutely nothing to talk about
I'll never understand why morning staff comes in and feels obligated to talk. Like it's 6am, come in and shut up..! Thanks <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I always forget my hairs red until I look in the mirror...
Think after this time imma let my undercut grow back in
Can't wait till I get my hair cut next week... It's growing back in so fast.
Why didn't I make it at 930? Ugh
Trying to stay up until this orthodontist appointment.

Let me go to sleep so I can get up and clean, wash, and study all day...
Have you ever prayed to God about the same thing and always get the same response? Move on, it's time.
I could have cried, but I wouldn't let it fall...
When it's two, it's more than just you.

He be defensive af over me, I love it !
I just want some food to satisfy my taste buds but idk what I'm craving.
And please, don't let me talk about parents just cursing their kids out! Omg. So disrespectful.
I hate when I'm out and a parent is beyond yelling at their child. Like why did you have 8 kids if you lacked patience?
I don't want kids. I swear, if my husband and I ever have kids, it was all Gods will.
Please don't take away your child's childhood by making them dress and act grown.
Oh it drives me insane when people dress their kids in sexy clothing...! Never should a child be labeled sexy. That's so sick smh.
All I ever want are flowers and a dog... That's it <BOUQUET><DOG FACE>
I want some spring flowers. Somebody please !

My hair was cute for about 2 hours.
Not feeling this trip to the shop at all
Of course I'd never take it from its habitat though.

I'm irritated I'm ready to be home and in my bed.
Being sad and being depressed are two different things...
My hairs poofy straight. Can't wait to get home and wAsh it
My hairs not straight anymore <WEARY FACE> well no more flat iron til 2016
People don't understand things and won't back you cause in their minds it doesn't make sense. But I thought love was unconditional
Don't change to impress a person or fit in. Soon as Yall fall out, you back to doing the things you swore you'd never do.?
My phone will die soon and have nothing productive to do...
If a person wants to smoke, be a drunk, and pop pills all day; do you but don't expect me to be around that behavior.
Don't change for me, be yourself... Doesn't mean imma stay though.
People are so selfish in their ways of thinking. Thinking that nobody can possibly feel or be different...
Why are there so many good plans on the @YouVersion app... I can't pick just one <WEARY FACE>

Jessa&amp;Ben <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><TWO HEARTS> #19KidsAndCounting
Josh and Anna always pregnant
Always gun be somebody who doesn't want to see you happy.
Long as you're doing bad, they look better.
When you get out of a bad situation, people are always going to want to see you back in a bad situation.
I pour my heart out every chance I get just so he doesn't doubt it.
Alright. I have an hour until 19 kids n counting
Bout to pack my suitcase and make a list of things I need
I need to find me a real pretty blue nail polish

Plus, you're never supposed to jump more than 2 degrees on a thermostat in the first place. So you shouldn't go from 74-68...
72-74 is a nice temp for a 60-70 degree day.
And there's never a reason to have air below 68 on a hot day... Like I've really seen my shares of 61s like really?!?
Air shouldn't be on unless A) you're having a party or B) it's 70+ degrees outside...
Just a waste of electricity
I'll never understand the whole "air on" when it's barely 60 outside...
Wedding weekend in PA with @FreeTr1p in a few weeks. #Excited

Coco just running.<RAT><MOUSE FACE> she doesn't know she's coming home tomorrow.
Having a partner that doesn't think their above you in any aspect of life is a great feeling.
Was supposed to go and see my dad but I'm tired n I don't Feel like it honestly.
It takes a strong man to make me mind. I honestly don't care about people's thoughts or feelings like I should.
Dealing with him...
My mouth really isn't as smart as it was 8 months ago. I bite my tongue a lot n think before  I speak now a days.
Good to have a man that doesn't let you talk to them crazy, but doesn't disrespect you either...
I hate asking a million &amp; two questions <WEARY FACE>
I literally force myself to think the worst... I hate that I do that...
Is it 8?
I'm ready to go home

I could never talk to a dude that dyes his hair...

Is it bad that as bad as I miss my dad I don't want to see him when he comes home cause part of mr lightweight hates him.
When you finally start to realize that you are the problem... <WEARY FACE>
I want a burger so bad<PENSIVE FACE>
That moment when all you want to do is stress eat but you're  trying to do better <WEARY FACE>
Sometimes things just make you wonder if it's worth it. And yet you continue to fight for it.
Why don't I ever bring my zzzquil when I travel ?
Honestly, if nothing in this world pisses me off, ignoring me does... I'm so frustrated right now!!!

Why am I always late you ask? Because I sit on my floor and think about what to wear instead of actually looking in my closet <UNAMUSED FACE>
Okay, let me get up and motivated. Too much stuff to do today to be sitting around here.
I'm tired of waking up cold. Or by the noise of others... Now I'm in a crappy mood.
No, but really I can't wait until I move
I obviously took too much zzzquil... My body feels like it's floating
I need to break something
I honestly haven't checked my voicemail since like last summer or something
I can't explain enough how much I dislike humans... Like nobody understands that obviously !!!
I can't stand a too friendly dude. Good day, I said good day...!!!
Okay. Let me do this homework
Swear it's always something man.
Thinking out loud
Sometimes attachment is unhealthy...
Say something I'm giving up on you
How could you walk away from all my tears ?
I swear nobody else frustrates me like him <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
That nicki video made me cry <CRYING FACE>

Okay let me hurry up and get dressed.

Why do people favorite stuff that doesn't pertain to them? Just trynna b smart smh. Grow up
I'm finally up, let me get dressed and start my  day <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèæ

Man let me update my phone
This man at my church keeps telling me he's saving me for his grandson... <UNAMUSED FACE> idk why everybody wants me to marry their kids and stuff <UNAMUSED FACE>
I love that my friends are as petty as me... @JoiShaunise88 @__outspoken1__ it makes talking to them so enjoyable #randomthought

I hate when a person goes back to the same person they were before they decided to change for you. Like just be you.

@dania_is_coco lol I got it all over my moms bathroom she was so mad
Sure hope I don't get red die all over my bathroom <WEARY FACE> it never comes out
I guess, God really wanted me to understand it when I finally got it.
I'll never understand why it took so long to understand that
You can try to make sense of something, or try to change something; but if that's not what it really is, your trying will never prevail
Im so happy that God finally opened my eyes. And I'm now able to see everything for what it is, not what I want it to be!
That margarita did nothing for me
I need to get this debt knocked out of my car and my car painted
Can't wait to make it to happy hour <WEARY FACE><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><TROPICAL DRINK>

I'm not about to unfriend you every time we have a disagreement. People are just too petty.
Don't let your pride mess up your future.
I miss grams... I need to go &amp; find her this weekend
I hate a dude that knows how to use his words... Be tricking me to believe em
I just wanna wash my hair, like so bad
It's a love hate type of thing
I really hate working midnights
He stay having an identity crisis
Still haven't seen the film wedding episode.
If marriage isn't the goal, why are you entertaining that person ?
When do we grow up?
Please explain...
I'll never understand the "All I wanna do is smoke, drink, and party with no goals or a job", mentality.
Why be with somebody that will only ever see you as a girlfriend/boyfriend?
Some people need to go back to high school and stay there, cause obviously that's where their mindset is stuck.
He always pops up at the right times. <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Dudes be 30 and still have commitment issues... <UNAMUSED FACE>

A man will try to break you down just to build himself up. #weak
Ugh I can't wait till I start this new job
Just cause I don't want to talk to you doesn't mean something's wrong. I just don't want to talk to you !!!
Two years is a long time, but it'll all work out in the end...
I want an edible arrangement with just pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew.
It's pretty selfish and egotistical...
A man will keep you strung along just for convenience...
Never lose site of your self worth for a man that can't see it.
I need to do my hair, I'm looking crazy.
Omg I love Jessa <WEARY FACE>
I be overthinking stuff to the fullest
Think I'll roller set my hair at work tonight

It's nothing but a distraction from their own life and problems. Focusing on everybody else's flaws, trying to make just of their actions.
Like, people care more about celebrities and the next person than themselves...
I'm supposed to be napping...
Reasons why I keep to myself...
Somehow you know everybody's business and can't keep nothing to yourself...
People gossip too much... I don't wanna hear it...!
I can honestly say I'm truly happy !
Subway sounds my next move
I never feel safe riding this van in the mornings... I'd so much rather be driving the clients myself
We got each other... That's why we work so well together...
‚Äú@WowPositiveMind: dont tickle me i‚Äôll stab you in the throat‚Äù @FreeTr1p

Well, Pinterest is where I'll be most of the night... Need to catch up on my Bible reading too...
Bitter, jealous, and wishy washy people kill me...
Focused on me and mine...
Give somebody everything and they still want more...
Over all the "fakeness" in my life
People you think are the best are sometimes the worst...

On a positive note, surgeon said I can eat rice...! <COOKED RICE>
But people aren't sincere... They only want you when they want you... Period...
Whether they need somebody to talk to, chill with, or text while at work...
I mean everyone's using you for an advantage in some way, that's life...
I dislike people so much...
People are just so selfish...
Someone who will come over and eat all of your stuff but when you touch one thing of theirs they want compensation...
Can't stand me a stingy person...
Like, my twist had all night to dry
Waking up with wet hair is the worst part of being natural... <UNAMUSED FACE>

It be the main ones talking about being humble that seek the most attention... <FROWNING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH> I'm confused <UNAMUSED FACE>
Like is it really that bad?
Finally, somebody that appreciates my humor...!
I should have brought my world civ book
Dudes sure are good at flipping the script and making it feel like it's your fault.
My mom is doing the most, I just want breakfast
I'd never just sit there and watch someone I love get disrespected, family or not, especially if it wasn't their fault...
Still aint get my glasses fixed <UNAMUSED FACE>
I've never take so much hurt and disrespect from a person, and I never will again...
Can't wait to get my cavities filled my mouth hurts
A dude will lie and say he doesn't care anymore but his actions will say otherwise
Dudes be so consumed in this, "Can't let them know I'm hurting", that they push everybody away, especially the ones they need!
My mom thinks im still sleep
A dude will raise a child that isn't his but won't help his own?
Left my Zzzquil in Akron <UNAMUSED FACE>
May can't come fast enough
Back to sleep I go...
Sleep is the only time I can shut the whole world out... Til my phone rings <UNAMUSED FACE>
I hate traveling on my days off especially
I used to look forward to my days off, now I just dread them just as much as my work days... <UNAMUSED FACE>
Ugh I always have to be doing something... Like ugh, 24 hours is all I need!!! If it's not one thing it's another
I really dislike people
This is my last weekend doing anything for or with anybody... I really need me time... I'm tired of looking at people everyday
Hopefully my car will be ready by 5...

That moment you realize: The person you thought you needed the most was the person you actually needed the least.
Everybody's always worried with what the next chick or dude thinks about them. They aren't even living for themselves. <VICTORY HAND>Ô∏èI do me regardless
People are so attention seeking... Like why though ?
The way some people think is beyond me
Just makes us so much closer

@__outspoken1__ hi!
I'm tired <WEARY FACE>
I'm ready to get off and lay in my bed
Why lose a lover for a phoney friend that will never progress...?
Why have a friend that doesn't respect your significant other ?
Distance yourself from negativity...
If a person has nothing to offer you other than company, the word "best" shouldn't come before "friend"... Useless...
They never want you to be in other friendships, or have relationships...
More than half of your "friends" are really out to get you! Trying to keep you below them or on the same level... Never above...
You'll never be happy trying to please everybody else...
If you can't make a decision on your own without consulting your friends, they control you.
If you're more worried about your friends opinions rather than your own happiness, they control you...
Where am I living next year ?!? <WEARY FACE>
He loves the way I love him...
The whole bottom of my mcflurry was going to be only ice cream...? Oh okay <UNAMUSED FACE>

Why didn't I take the time to twist and wrap my hair up last night ? Ugh
The hardest thing is for me to act mean and mad...
I think his model is going to look really good, pretty interesting what a couple of boxes can turn into.
Dudes stay saying things they don't mean just to seem in control, and end up regretting it later...
That would require a husband first anyways
I never want kids...

I still love you even though you wasted my time. <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è<WATCH>Ô∏è
