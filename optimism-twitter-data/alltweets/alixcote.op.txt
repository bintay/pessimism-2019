@PJNewWest let's get through this bonspiel before you make any rash decisions.
@CanSpice @stickers66 @AliceCavanagh @PJNewWest Brad and Pat could have used your help ;)
@PJNewWest of course!
@weskoop @CanSpice @AliceCavanagh @jjbeanfolks @MikeFolka @jonathanxcote @jenarbo @Obrassor will try and meet up later! Have prior plans.

@PJNewWest @CanSpice @AliceCavanagh hmm I can try. Flying solo with 2.5 yr old this weekend.
@PJNewWest @CanSpice @AliceCavanagh so stoked! Will there be a chance to throw a few practise rocks before?

@jonathanxcote I have no idea....

@PJNewWest @CanSpice @AliceCavanagh :(
@marcykoop @jonathanxcote @TheRecord I agree it can't be banned, but it would be nice to not have to always sidestep.
@jonathanxcote @TheRecord I would love it if you could ban it. But don't ban groups of more than 3. We wouldn't be able to walk around town.
Moon. Home. 
@MsNWimby I hear you. (As I take the bus home from work at 9:30)

@NWimby Usually I can hear that thing no matter where or what I am doing at home, but totally missed it this time if it was!
@AMarkwart Very sorry to hear that. There was a man on a bike that would collect our bottles when we lived in QP. I think his name was Greg.
@rubycampbell those little elastics will be found in random places for years to come.
@pfindling wow! Looks way more intense than what I felt on my fourth floor office building.

@Mondor13 sweet! if we are in town we will be there!
@DesireeRD yum! What kind of blender do you use? Mine is terrible and I want to upgrade soon. Looking for recommendations if you have any!
@KIMDanceStudio I am interested in the DanceFit class! Sounds like fun! 
@jonathanxcote @pfindling @jenarbo It was on earlier today....I saw it running this afternoon.
@SwimBarkRun oven fire in our building.
At Starbucks in my Pajamas. Thanks morning fire alarm.
@Gri94 @Ginger1383 Not the best photo! She is lovely w/ a collar but no address. We have a Surrey tag, so hoping to find owners on Monday.
@BoomTownBill Thanks Will! We found someone who has dogs to take her overnight, so we are ok for now!
@MichelleLKent thanks! We found a dog person to take her overnight. Please retweet though! Would love to find her owner.
Also, anyone have a leash we can borrow overnight?
Found this guy roaming across King George and 84 ave just now in #surrey. Anyone missing a dog? #found 
Daddy's little tax deduction 
@LOFTYLIVING I LOVE chevrons! Can't wait to see!
@stickers66 Aldor Acres in Langley. It is a dairy farm.
Renee's first field trip! 
@Mondor13 Sounds nice! Enjoy!
@Mondor13 taking a day to yourself?
@weskoop London Drugs takes them.
@BoomTownBill so exciting!
Hey #NewWest, check your #lotto tickets! Someone won $74,000 in the 6/49! Sadly it wasn't me. 
@maybe2mrrow Cute!
@maybe2mrrow @breebop Um, Hello "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" playlist! That was my afternoon motivation!
@MsNWimby I am starting at the very beginning. Haven't run in a LONG time. I would have to be home by 7:30am to get the kids out the door.
Looking for someone who wants to train with me for a 10k run in July. I am a newbie. Available for fair weather &amp; early morning runs!
@joninacampbell @jasonlesage @jenarbo I agree with the inequity issues. Ultimately funding needs to be there.
Happy baby! 
@JasonLesage @jenarbo @joninacampbell You could contact your school PAC and see what initiatives they have to support their school needs.
@Mondor13 :(  It is just the start of your day! Hope it gets better.
@chrismbryan I agree.  We can walk &amp; transit pretty much everywhere for our day to day activities - groceries, school, errands, parks, etc.
@weskoop kid tweet. Lol.

Love the new @KIMDanceStudio renos! Congrats Jessica! Renee &amp; Leah are looking forward to more lessons with you.
“@pinkyandcompany: Best picnic blanket/bag ever! #picnicblanket #picnicseason #centralpark 
New Westminster News Leader - COLUMN: Happy to pay a little more for public education 

@maybe2mrrow @victoriajh you are lucky to have such a good friend!
@chrismbryan Check out @newwestcycle. Lots of selection of new &amp; used bikes. We bought a great used bike for our daughter for Xmas last year
@reupbbq Is there a vegetarian option for your Sunday Supper?
@blondeonabudget I am with @NWimby on this! I love living downtown #NewWest.
@nickamado @davemetzak @barleyshomebrew nice guys!
@msewen @davidphelan Count me in!
@stickers66 Yes, this is the second time it has now closed.  Not sure what is in store next.
Sad to see Quantum Cafe Bistro is closing. Last day is this Thursday. Reminder to support your local businesses!
Enjoying a morning treat @CrepeDesAmis @rivermrkt #picatreat #downtownnewwest @downtownnewwest @nwbia 
@MsNWimby @nwimby love homemade pizza!  We have been on a pizza kick lately. So good!
Sitting outside on the balcony in a tshirt. It is hot out here!
@alixcote @NWimby Correction...on my phone I don't see any tweets, but on my computer I do....
@NWimby weird. I wasn't blocked this morning, but now I am.
Big kids pawned off for the night...now to decide where to go for dinner with baby in tow!
That's one way to use a soother. 
@alixcote @NWimby @MsNWimby Just saw your other tweet. I wonder how long they will last.
@NWimby @MsNWimby Wow! That is a lot. I was hoping it would be less... When do tickets go on sale?
@rubycampbell @MsNWimby wow, talk about committed!
@breebop was it healed in that time?  Renee's rupture was fairly big. We had a lot of follow ups. Luckily she didn't need surgery.
@breebop oh wow! We had to cotton ball for about 4 months until fully healed. Lots of delicate instruments behind the ear drum!
@breebop they may not be necessary, but it needs to be monitored to ensure it heals. Pretty scary when it first happens, hey?
@breebop It happened to Renee last yr. Def go to dr to check it out. Prepare for cotton balls at bath time &amp; no swimming! Hope he feels ok.
Fascinating! 
@victoriajh oooh!  I will have to try that.  How hot? Like boiling hot, or hot out of the tap?
Thought they would have been able to invent a doll whose hair doesn't turn into a rats nest by now. 
#FF @KIMDanceStudio - Miss Jessica has fantastic dance classes for kids &amp; soon to have adult classes! Lots of energy &amp; enthusiasm! #NewWest
@BrickMortarLivi I think I will be stopping by to check these out!
Is there anyone in #NewWest that will convert VHS and cassette tapes to digital? I have a lot of old tapes I want to preserve...
Looks great! RT“@KIMDanceStudio: Phase one of reno's complete, Website updated, 
@weskoop ah, Ballmer! So hilarious!
@weskoop ?
@cart66 Is it possible to show the checkout form with the paypal-express pymt method? Often paypal does not have the info I req, like phone#
Ahhhhh! So excited! #MaddAddam, the third novel in @MargaretAtwood's trilogy is set to be released late Aug in Canada! Can't wait!
@matthewlaird no kidding!
Anyone have a 3-5 y/o that would be interested in a Hip Hop class at @KIMDanceStudio starting in May to June? 4:30-5:15pm. Kids love it!
@KIMDanceStudio @BellaCakes13 Thank you for Leah's party and cupcake! The kids had a great time. Love Gangnam Style...the kids loved it too!
@marcykoop season 1 was by far the best in my opinion. I haven't seen this season yet. Disappointed to hear it isn't so good.
@NWimby I generally avoid them, but no tills were open, excpt cust service which had a huge line! Of course, "unknown item" caused an error.
Does anyone else hate self checkout as much as I do?  So frustrating!
@NWimby after running into you, Renee asked "Is he the fastest bike rider?" She was also intrigued by your shoes.
@BrickMortarLivi Love the Law Courts! Such a great public space.  The kids love running around there.
Girls night at @wildricebc! Looking forward to catching up and my favourite dishes, shrimp toast &amp; kung pao!
@stickers66 the tire was going pretty fast. Very lucky there weren't any kids there at the time! Bounced all the way down to DouglasCollage.
A tire bounced off a truck on Royal and across the sidewalk on the walk to school today 20ft ahead. Make sure you secure your loads people!
@sugar_man I am so disappointed the Vancouver show has been cancelled! My mom &amp; I were really looking forward to it! I hope you reschedule!
@frenchpressme YES! We just started it last week. The narrative thing doesn't happen that often and it helps you to understand a bit more.
Coffee.  That is all.
@stickers66 I think it was an underground transformer that exploded (source @ScanBC)
@jenarbo Thanks! Ah, wish it would work for us. We go away a lot of weekends in the summer. We might be able to sub some nights though....
@jenarbo when does the season start/end?
@matthewlaird Have you looked at WuFoo or Google Docs? You can create forms with Google Docs.
@frenchpressme have you seen Searching for Sugarman yet? Amazing story. I am going to his show at the commodore in April.
Searching for infant childcare starting September.  Needs to be close to downtown New West or Skytrain. Anyone have any leads?
@weskoop great endorsement!
@weskoop Thanks Wes! There are a few plugins that I have used, but it seems JetPack has a lot of the basics and is free.
@TheaVHill I had a good time too!  We should definitely take advantage of us both being on mat leave and hang out more!
@weskoop You haven't had any performance issues? I have seen a few comments that is slows down sites...
Jetpack by WP.  Yay or Nay?  A lot of good features, but you have to have a wp .com account and connect to it.
@beta5chocolates I wish you were closer to me!  I think I would be there every day.
@NWimby ...but I think I am going to do a bit of my own research....
@NWimby I won't lie, I was panicking at the thought of coal after I saw this the last few days. Glad coal is handled differently...
@NWimby Ah, I was wondering what that was!
@stickers66 @newwestcycle they are $60. Lots of great designs and they have the adjustable strap so there is room for kids to grow.
Enjoyed a ride with her new Nutcase helmet from @newwestcycle.  Perfect fit! 
@shadwell123 I felt taken advantage of that day, but agree with pay parking at hospitals. Sometimes they are too ruthless with the tickets.
Love this scarf! Enter to win $30 store credit at 
@shadwell123 @NWimby Jon came to pick me up after he passed away and as we were leaving the building they were placing a ticket on the car.
@shadwell123 @NWimby I paid for a LOT of parking during my Dad's stay at hospice.
@popupwineevents looks like a great event right up my alley!  However, I won't be able to attend tonight! Keep us up to date future events!
@Kat_McConnell @breebop we started last week to try to avoid the stress of it this year. Worked at a slow pace.  It was definitely better.
@jenarbo I can't wait to check it out!  Jonathan and I are finishing another series before we get hooked on anything new!
@DesireeRD I hear ya! I am always looking for easy &amp; healthy vegetarian meals for my family!
@DesireeRD so easy! Thanks!
@DesireeRD Oh that looks so good! How do you make your wilted kale?
@TheaVHill yes, I printed off the cards and the girls stamped. They had fun!
Potato stamp valentine cards. 
@CMNewWest Awesome! When do we find out the location?
@rivermrkt @PechaKuchaNW Chit Chat! Is the ticket still available?
@Kat_McConnell lovely! Still stuck in the fog here!
@SewGoodca Thanks for the tips!
@nwfarmers I think this is the first winter market this season that isn't pouring rain!
@TheaVHill Can't wait!
@TheaVHill hope it is going smoothly!
@nickamado @songza me too.
@stickers66 
@breebop @frenchpressme @jenarbo Royal Tandoori is my favourite. Love their naan, veggie pakoras and butter mutter paneer!
Babysitter secured! Now to plan a nice evening out!
@MusicBoxNW looks great! Congrats on the grand opening!
@Kat_McConnell Renee was 2.5 when she moved into a low Ikea twin bed.  We needed to move her so her sister could use the toddler bed.
@Kat_McConnell @rivermrkt they were crafting together!  Audrey is adorable! Looks like she was having a fun day with dad! @frenchpressme
Good time today at the @rivermrkt ! 
I want to recycle some old plaques and trophies I have sitting in boxes from when I was a kid.  Anyone know where I could take them?
Congrats @mobify! RT 10 Canadian tech companies to watch in 2013 - 
At the park. 
@TheaVHill no kidding!  Well, hopefully you can enjoy this sunny day and relax!
@TheaVHill thinking about you! Sending good vibes!
@TheaVHill how have you been feeling? I keep think of you guys!  So excited!
@TheaVHill only 34 hours and you have a 2013 baby! I hope you make it!
@Kat_McConnell Starbuck!  It is in French with subtitles - great film!
@TheaVHill I think Tuesday will be better if that works for you?
@IvyTatlock @zoomhairsalon Okay, I need to check this out!  I will be making an appointment soon!
@TheaVHill I have a some maternity clothes I am done with. Are you interested in coming over one day after work to see if you want anything?
@TheaVHill everytime we bring out the camera she stops dancing!  We will get it eventually.
@TheaVHill I am trying to teach Leah the Gangnam Style dance - she is pretty good.  My kids are now obsessed with Korean music videos.
@TheaVHill Haha - not sure! I actually don't post on twitter very much.  I lurk. I have been meaning to post more - maybe this is the start!
@BoomTownBill I will be heading to bed shortly. Expecting it to be a long night.  Are they close to finishing?
@BoomTownBill @NewWestEdge @scanbc Lights are on in the businesses and restoration company is at the site.  Hopefully not too much damage!
@BoomTownBill @nwfarmers @jonathanxcote tickets bought, babysitter lined up and stoked for the good food and silent auction!
@cdemwell Thanks Chris.  Actually, I have been working on some money making schemes lately :D
@matthewlaird I hope you guys are having fun!  Good work everyone!
@dleslie Awesome Dan!  Thanks for the list!
@jenarbo crap - I don't check twitter often enough!  Next week?
@cdemwell you should also follow the Farmers Market - @nwfarmers
@dleslie We have a double bike trailer.  Jonathan pulled them most of the way...We went to Choices near Edmonds for lunch.
Enjoyed a lovely 15km bike ride with Jonathan and the girls today.
Already in the #newwest flu vaccine line up at the mall.  The line is growing fast!
