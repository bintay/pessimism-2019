environmental economics definition: we value the environment  - herminia francisco

environmental economics definitions - #devtalks the economic system is inside Earth's biosphere.
Dasgupta #devtalks Green GDP is a misnomer. It cannot be green because it is gross. It does not account for depreciation. @Sida
Dasgupta: #devtalks hardboiled economists ask "where are these tipping points?" - tipping points are felt at the microscale -forests, water
Sterner: what is stopping progress are the lobbies. They may be weakened by the arrival of renewables #devtalks
Sterner: I am a happy and optimistic guy but I have to say things are pretty bad. In 25 years we have done not much. #devtalks
Sterner: two tenets on climate are challenged: price on carbon (there's a halo round Sweden) and global treaty. #devtalks
Sterner: first policy instruments were arrows, borders and hedges to keep people out. #devtalks
Sterner: ignorance, greed and procrastination - the reasons we are in this predicament #devtalks #futureearth
Thomas Sterner: policy instruments for the anthropocene #devtalks on now
Carl Folke mentions #futureearth as part of the solution for building resilience for global sustainability #devtalks
Carl Folke: #devtalks #anthropocene - it is the scale, connectivity, spread and speed.

@Ninad_Bondre @RZondervan still think Macmillan missed a trick for a genuine high-quality journal. Casting no aspertions on these others.

@rjtklein @vgalaz @Ninad_Bondre @AlbertNorstrm Agreed. But is it justified? And is PB being misunderstood?
@rjtklein @vgalaz @ninad_bondre @albertnorstrm u may be overrating the importance of PBs in process?
@rjtklein @vgalaz @ninad_bondre @albertnorstrm mdgs had limited broad engagement. Sdgs may have more but depth of inclusion questionable.
@rjtklein @vgalaz @ninad_bondre @albertnorstrm the issue is likely to be that all inclusion is merely lip service.
@rjtklein @vgalaz @ninad_bondre @albertnorstrm so inclusion of science excludes others and other viewpoints?
