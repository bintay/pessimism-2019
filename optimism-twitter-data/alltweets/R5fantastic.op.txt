FAV- Dinner date with fave 
~<PENGUIN>A 
@RosserBellarina @rikerR5 I mean, If your bf/gf got immense hate from this person, Would you block them, or let them keep hating?
@harleylynchr5 They did, Because of the hate on  Vanni and Savannah, Or that is what I heard :o

Or 

Fav - Prefer R5 performing at Coachella

Or 

Fav - Want RIKER to arrest you
Riker and Savannah
Ryland and Savannah
Rydellington
Ross and Courtney

And I'm still…
In all the power of Riker, I love all things rn okay
If they get eliminated, I am going to throw my heel at the tv. then crawl in a hole and cry #teamrallison
@rydelslayme AGREE! 100%
PERFECT SCORE! YES! GO FREAKIN RUMOR AND VAL! I LOVE IT! PERFECT! AMAZING! YAS
I love Nastia, but the 1 thing i dont like, is that they are mixing her gymnastics with dance most weeks
Literally, The fact that Riker is so optimistic, and so happy, It is going to make it hard for him to act vunerable on purpose
Riker's Muscles..Dang
@DAYTRIPPERIKER But he would pick you up, then take you with him, Keep both of you save for the 2 in spider, that will potentially kill him
@Islandgirl_Keba But you tweet about Riker being to trained for dancing with the stars, sure thats wasting your time too..But oh well
@Islandgirl_Keba Please dont compare Riker's 1 month training 10 years ago, he was a kid, lots of years have passed, hakuna matata, get over
@powerpuffxhemmo Sentence*
@powerpuffxhemmo He said more powerful words in  that senctence
@AguilarAnan All of them have fans, Riker isnt getting votes because he is in a band. Many people outside of the fandom are also voting him
@bubsxgreen I found it, Thanks, He also started crying because they went home...I think?
@Chezhdchick Lowballing Rumer deffiniatly
@brennan_1299R5 He was third to last
@bubsxgreen I have heard about it,i just cant find where he said it
@Ready5etRockyR5 I still do think they had a better dance, This wasn't because the scores, this was merely based on votes
@ImTeamRallison I still think Riker's dance was better, but that doesnt change my opinion on Wilow, She was and still is my 2nd fav
MY NEXT TO FAVORITES ARE IN JEAPODRY WHAT
RIKER AND ALLISON ARE SAFE! YAS
@stelenaispure I am pretty sure Riker picked Willow because their scores were tied...
@TruthOfR5Family Probably, That is what alot of non Riker fans think. Even though he tells each dancers they did amazing after each dance
@TruthOfR5Family He probably has the biggest fanbase, Because not many people are known, So yeah I agree
@TruthOfR5Family Ikr.. I think Riker and Allison arent any of the judges so far favorites, So, They seem to be scoring them less
@TruthOfR5Family I think Willow and Mark got pity votes by the judges
Tbh, In my opinion, Riker danced, Willow just shook her hips and did a flip..
Well..Umm the fans think RIker is better, but the judges think Willow is better,,
@DancingABC Both killed it! But i think #DwtsRiker
@twerksforpizza Cool
Even though i love Riker, And I want him to be on the top, Nastia's dance was one point
CRAP NO! NO NO! BAD NASTIA! NO
@Phil_In_MN @sammycola5 Subject to opinion, Riker is Rockin
FROM LEN A TEN
@gabegoodman09 Riker Lynch?
riker be first..Finally
@I_Dream_Disney Rumer didnt ask to change it, Riker and Allison did...
@VittoriaR5m Oh! Thanks
@VittoriaR5m how did you find out that they broke up?
@calumsross Riker's is like 17<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@RossR5isbae Never thought of it that way, Maybe he is being hard on him, To really push him because he thinks riker can win
@taraaaR5 Same
They are last...Gurrrr
@Ready5etRockyR5 Oh no...Yah he is probably worried...
@Ready5etRockyR5 Wait what happened to Vanni...?
@thisiskick He has been 4th once, but all other times, he has come in 2nd
@XxR5FamilyxX But, I also have some sort of feeling that he might not get far..Maybe I am just paronoid
@XxR5FamilyxX I did when he was in jeapody, but let's be real, Riker's got an okayly big fan base, compared to some people on the show.
@princess_imanii Derek and Nastia got two 8's, I wouldnt count on him getting on 10 based on favoritism,  unless Rumor and Val get 40/40
@XxR5FamilyxX Be positive, We got his back, I feel like he has a while to go, but I am not sure :o
@JadeeeR5 Wait how did you find this out?
@R5Philippines I know right! Then he had to dance RIGHT AFTER he was told his fans dont care enough to vote! Even though we do! Gurr
@R5Philippines It made him so sad, They made it seem like we dont even care about it, then shoved the idea in his face..thats messed up
@R5Philippines I know! They first told Riker he was in Jeapordy, But then try shoved it in his face that his fans dont vote, But we do!
@R5Philippines To create drama/Suspense for the fans
@SassyDelly Same! I thought Riker and Allison's was a close maybe third, After Willow and Rumers
@R5Philippines He wasnt nessisaley in the bottom, DWTS pick random people that dont have the bottom scores to be in jeapordy with the lowest
@AndreaG114 The scores and Votes that count are from last week, Which means, this couldnt mean anything
I AM CRYING RN! FOOTBALL PLAYER AND WILLOW'S FREAKIN AMAZING! RIKER AHH IDK! UGHH WILLOW AND RIKER ARE MY FAVS! WHAT DO I DO!
GOOOO TEAM FREAKIN MARKINGJAY!! OMG! YOU GUYS DID FREAKIN AMAZING! CANT BELIEVE YOU ARE IN JEPORDY (Along with Rallison)  39 IS FREAKIN PERF
Riker and Rumer's friendship is life rn :)
@julia_crzyGiirl Hey maybe Ross's mystery gal is also named Savannah :P
@infinitylxke I cried for both, But the reason's Riker's got to me, is because I have been a fan of him for years, And he finally made it
@kristenlalala But, he is a good dancer, I dont judge biastly
Life is about creating yourself 

Or 

Fav - Judge and give him a perfect score

@jeddelfin I agree! It was like 10 years ago! Zendaya was like a proffesional hip hop dancer and no one complained about her
@EnPointe2 @carrieanninaba I wasn't of fan, But That was almost ten years ago, It shouldn't count toward him being Proffesional
Everyone thinking Riker is a trained ballroom Proffesional dancer
@EnPointe2 @carrieanninaba Rage*
@EnPointe2 @carrieanninaba Sorry but I have been a fan of Riker for years now, Sure he was on so you think you can dance and he danced race
