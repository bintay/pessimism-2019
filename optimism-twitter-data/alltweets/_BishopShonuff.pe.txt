@iamkimmie25 that's where maturity plays a part as well.
@iamkimmie25 and it doesn't mean that he still messes with the BM. More like he's just tryna keep tabs mainly bc of the child. But then
@QueenVeeBow2me not every baby mama is hell.
@iamkimmie25 makes sense. But I'm a bit conflicted about that as well
I don't understand why women wouldn't date a man with a kid(s)?
<NEUTRAL FACE> 
I swear if I didn't know any better, I would let Twitter turn me off from dating completely since women don't know how to keep calm.
You try to stab me, see if you don't end up in a coffin. I don't play that shit.
@BecauseYouLuvMe I'll recover. And she's that crazy then I don't need her.
Idc if my girl stabs me that bitch getting sent to the hospital. You attempt to take my life, then you shall expect the same.
@itssunnyyyy not enough at all
@mellowtoo_hype nope. I'm surprised if I don't kill her after that.
@itssunnyyyy yup. DeVante brought so many people to the industry that they don't even know that he's the reason for all of it.
Exactly 
Nor timbaland, missy Elliot, ginuwine, list goes on.  
Smart  
How does one ensure thyself that everything will be okay and to stay calm?
@LustClouds this is also true.
@LustClouds lol it's not as frequent though. Plus sometimes that isn't the case with some girls.

If a person say "fight me" on Facebo‚Ä¶
Beast Mode 
@LustClouds why I didn't know this? Lol
@LustClouds <EYES><EYES>
Never really went out of style if we're being honest lol  
@nesssayvettee lol nah how could I?
If I don't go back to St. Louis, I'm definitely taking my talents back to Texas. East Coast ain't really for me anymore.
@nesssayvettee I'm glad to see you've changed ya mind lol
I wouldn't call em lesbians lol  
No movies today <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I wonder who's gonna be going to #NCCU for summer school?
@yunghotebony__ I feel sorry for whoever truly believes that. It's horrible to have self-esteem issues
@rebellious_loc that's all that is
@Just_JayyTee completely
@MUHFUGGINJKELLS @aheroamongmen neither was DBZ at first. It didn't really kick off in America until they edited it for Cartoon Network
@LexingtonDrive_ exactly. It's basically just self-esteem issues.
@aheroamongmen accessibility
@Just_JayyTee ol girl was definitely reaching. Maybe she's the dumb one.
@aheroamongmen ehh to each his own
Because all some girls worry about is finding love, but haven't taken the time to really appreciate themselves.
@nachash_ lol you right but still
All Keke Palmer was saying to not worry so much about finding love. Learn to love yourself first.
@aheroamongmen that's because they've become some Americanized somewhere down the line. Just because they're iconic doesn't make it better.
@nachash_ you know why lol when yall use it in the bedroom
What's wrong with what she said? I completely agree with her.  
@nachash_ Kegels are the devil smh
@TheOtherManning <EYES><EYES>
I maybe biased though because Yu Yu Hakusho is probably my favorite anime show of all time.
Real. YYH is definitely better than DBZ  
@aheroamongmen happy birthday kid

You're appreciated  
Agreed. I was low key pissed when i heard golden state had fired him.

SN to PS4 Twitter:

If you haven't noticed you can play music off of Spotify while you play your game. You're welcome.
What did y'all like and dislike about Age of Ultron? #asktwitter
I think Ima finally catch Furious 7 tomorrow morning.
I actually cherish being single. Gives me so much ample time to work on myself.
Appreciate that  
@Tariku__ ahh you cuffed now bro? Salute
Bruh I'm just curious @Tariku__ what type of girls do you be fucking with on here?
I see why the relationship game is fucked. The social interactions are FUCKED  
@IStayCoolingg I still understand the pain lol
@lad3uxieme lol there's nothing wrong with it man. You're human. Don't let a particular day stop you from being you.
@IStayCoolingg not too bad I guess
@lad3uxieme you say that like people don't have sex on Sunday's.
Filth tweets will prosper regardless of the time and day.  
Movie is too hilarious  
BRUH SAY IT AGAIN!!!  
@BecauseYouLuvMe ehh lol I feel you though
@BecauseYouLuvMe same. I'm only opening it up if I wanna swap out music for my phone.
@JefeRaps hella. R&amp;B playlists are degrees higher than rap playlists.
@JefeRaps spotify?
Y'all talk so much awful shit about your Mom and Dad for what? I understand you're hurt but spewing hatred isn't gonna make it any better.
And it's not even close. I'm not even logging on that day.  
@IStayCoolingg how much bread you dropped?
I hate Mother's Day on Twitter. Y'all too depressing for me.
@IStayCoolingg oh damn lol I understand now
@IStayCoolingg what's the occasion?,
@WelcometoAshia you real for helping out lol
@IStayCoolingg lol it be like that sometimes
I'm tryna find my way into STL Twitter.
#hurt 
Not at all. She can actually help me get myself together if anything.  
Yeah, I'm making this move to STL after graduation. I'm calling it.
This new DJ Clue mixtape SLAPS!
Ultron was a excellent villain but idk. I felt like he coulda been explored some more.
Age of Ultron was still pretty great but I felt like the storyline could've been a little more developed.
@nachash_ lol true.
No unfollows when I‚Ä¶
@nachash_ you think you could answer it? Lol
@nachash_ nah I had to ask the TL a question about myself and got caught up in discussions lol
@Tariku__ nah bruh lol you got it.
@nachash_ lol oh okay
@Tariku__  
@iamkimmie25 appreciate that a lot. You too.
@iamkimmie25 I'll be good though. Just gonna take a minute.
@iamkimmie25 idk maybe because I'm still suffering from the aftermath of the break up. This was my very first relationship.
@iamkimmie25 I was, we just couldn't really find a common ground anymore.
@_BadPuttyTat I guess I am lol
@iamkimmie25 I agree with you on that last part. That's basically what I was tryna tell you. That's why my last one didn't work.
@_BadPuttyTat lmaooo I don't know about that Notebook type tip but I actually do believe in making my partner is happy no matter what.
@iamkimmie25 there's really no set definition of that.
@_BadPuttyTat lmaooo you making me seem like the type out of a movie like dude
@iamkimmie25 yeah I try to to the best of my abilities but that can't show if the other person isn't tryna do their part.
Goodnight folks. Sleep well and be smart. Btw Happy Mothers Day to every mom.
Do I seem like the boyfriend type guy? Because I don't see it lol?
Before I nod off to sleep I got a question to ask y'all.
@iamkimmie25 lol he real.
@IplayWr_Db_Rb I haven't listened to the whole thing of that yet.
Welcome to Fazoland is an instant classic. Especially Koolin and At the Light.
@IplayWr_Db_Rb welcome to fazoland still rocks to this day
@iamkimmie25 you bump Herb? Incredible lol never thought that
I can't wait until Lil Herb drops a new project.
@iamkimmie25 oh trust and believe. I know this lol
@IplayWr_Db_Rb it's not man.
Pussy ain't supposed to smell or taste like anything. If you really think this, then you've got a problem.
@iamkimmie25 hmmm wish I was on your level lol
@iamkimmie25 that's where forgiving plays a role. Whether you think the person is still worth to deal with or not is up to you.
@iamkimmie25 getting hurt is inevitable though. There's just degrees to it
@iamkimmie25 I'm terrified of it. But that's because I fear life more than anything in the world.
@iamkimmie25 I'm distraught tbh.
@iamkimmie25 I'm trying to. As a person that doesn't like change, I know I have to eventually.
@iamkimmie25 right? I've been so fucked up about everything that I've disconnected myself from most of my current life.
Dawg I'm really starting to grow.... This feels very weird.

@aheroamongmen oh I already knew you were earning money off this somewhat so I never really paid it any mind tbh.
Don't be petty and cut your friend off just because they're hanging with someone YOU don't like. Your problems and mine are not the same.
@aheroamongmen your situation is different. We been knew this lol
I've never understood that if you're my friend, you wouldn't befriend the person I dislike. Nigga if you don't shut your childish ass up.
People give social media way too much power anyway.
I tweet what I want. Whether you wanna take it to heart or not is completely up to you.
Real.  
Pussy or real food?  
@Leekz_So_Swavey lmao I ain't cocky though
I would never take someone's girl intentionally. Karma is a bitch and I ain't tryna feel her.
EVERY SINGLE THING.  
Of course.  
I'm just talking shit lol don't mind me.
I ain't the most attractive guy but I can still attract attention from a nigga's girl on my worst day. Don't get this twisted.
I'm a black guy that loves black women flaws and all.
It's quite a bit pathetic how everyone demoralize the interested by simply referring to them as "hoes".
@KirbKirbs true. Lol appreciate that.
I wouldn't really call the girls that are interested in me "hoes". I consider them more to be options.
@KirbKirbs lol what's there to like about it? It's plain to me
Before you consider a relationship, make sure you learn the difference of love and being in love. This is more vital to life than you think.
You can tell a person you love em all day, but if your love and their love isn't the same they'll be quick to cut you off. Insecurity.
People are so anxious to tell someone that they love them romantically that they tend to be ignorant of other meanings of love. Bad idea.
You wanna know how people misconstrue the word love so much? They na√Øvely believe that it automatically validates your stance with that one.
Love is more of an appreciation of the role that particular person plays in your life. What they've done. How they've helped you grow.
Love doesn't just applies to romance. It's the most desired but not the only kind of love.
People way too often narrows the meaning of love and wonder why they always come out fucked up at the end.
@KirbKirbs 
@_kissmeimkenyan FACTS
@KirbKirbs lol what does it sound like?
@Leekz_So_Swavey more like Prince of R&amp;B. Kellz still had it on lock to me lol
UNTOUCHABLE 
Think I'm about to blast 56 Nights even though it's basically 1:45am lol
@Leekz_So_Swavey then he got even more ruthless with the braids. LMAO 12 Play Two screams Thug R&amp;B
@Leekz_So_Swavey shit neither did Kelz at first but that didn't stop him lol
@Leekz_So_Swavey lmaooo he did have the du rags on deck though
@_BadPuttyTat lol trueeee. Man was for real the hook gawd
@Leekz_So_Swavey I can see the first three but Case? Idk
@_mellowlifee lol if you say so and he fits it to me. Whether can I listen to him all the time is debatable
@_BadPuttyTat that's pretty valid.
Oh hell no 
@_mellowlifee lol what do you consider August Alsina? And nah Lyfe is Captain Save Em music lol
Who do y'all think fit in the category of Thug R&amp;B? #asktwitter
@_mellowlifee you could say Jodeci but that's arguable.
You can have anything I got 
All of me right on the spot.
Wait Jaheim AND Jodeci I meant.
Jaheim really was the father of Thug R&amp;B lol
@joshstlauwrent that song rides too lol
Anything by Jaheim will forever ride
@_kissmeimkenyan this has some truth to it
Jaheim is one of my favorite all-time singers.
@_BadPuttyTat word lol she did her thing on that.
@_BadPuttyTat I really wouldn't call it a comeback but it was a return to form for her.
Debatable lol  
90s Mary J Blige will forever be the best.
@_BadPuttyTat this cannot be argued. Her last album that was great to me was the Breakthrough
@SincerelyLegit that too
@_BadPuttyTat nah some debut albums are trash.
*Whats The 411 but Share My World is dope too.  
@_BadPuttyTat more than you think lol
@_BadPuttyTat my favorite song from her next to reminisce
Captain America really does have the best movies out of the MCU.
@__laurenicole lol don't be mad
@SincerelyLegit you mean lol
@_____ashbash 
@BecauseYouLuvMe I'll let you rock lol
@shegreentea I'm seeing that dudes prefer otherwise. Niggas too weird these days.
@BecauseYouLuvMe <EYES><EYES><EYES>
I'd honestly prefer my woman to have sex toys rather than find outside dick.
@__laurenicole lmao I'm playing

@_____ashbash 
STL accents are not that country lol
@BecauseYouLuvMe I can unfortunately
@_____ashbash lmao you ain't heard NOLA voices then
@BecauseYouLuvMe that's silly smh
@_____ashbash I kinda heard an up north twang to it but STL (St. Louis$
I'm too plain to have someone jealous of me.  
@_____ashbash lol where are you from?
I wanna bag a MILF at least once in my life.
Same. I'm too affectionate lol  
@_____ashbash now let's hear yours lol
@_kissmeimkenyan yeah I'm really just speaking off of experience.
@_____ashbash lol appreciate that
@_kissmeimkenyan nah you could not really be good at dancing but be bomb in bed.
@_____ashbash lol I feel like you're being nice but what do you think then?
@_____ashbash not like mine lol
@_____ashbash oh it isn't?

My voice is annoying lol yall about to see.

Can't imagine myself doing it now but maybe somewhere in the future 
Couldn't take it seriously lol  
Hiatus 
Single; two-three weeks.  
That's difficult lol  
Nah and it depends on who the girls are.

People that are uptight and judgmental.  
Don't have one. I love movies too much  
Surprisingly it's not. Body count doesn't mean shit though.  
Straight 
Can't say honestly 
@BecauseYouLuvMe not even being sap. This goes for friends too.
If I argue with you, and I rarely argue, it's because I care. If you can't grasp that, then we've got a problem.
@VG3_ nah let em be ignorant. If they don't understand now they never will. Plus it gives you the bigger advantage once you pipe em
Dancing skills doesn't really correlate to sex though lol.  
People hate people that they can't easily define or understand.
Believe it or not, but being mysterious does give you a lot of power. As long as people can't really define or understand you, you straight.
@MillerThaGod lol you got a point there
@geez_gab twitpic lol jk
@MillerThaGod lol surprised you remember that.
@geez_gab <EYES><EYES><EYES><EYES>
Facts. Thought I was the only one that caught on to this.  
@nachash_ what does shell mean? Lol never knew
I'll tweet about sex all day. Doesn't mean I necessarily want it at that moment though. It's just fun to talk about.
I love sex but it definitely isn't everything. I'll just continue to explore outside of it.
I ain't having sex unless I feel like I really need to have some.
Same. I just like to catch my twerks and be out.  
Damn yall really didn't fuck with that avi lmao
@_BadPuttyTat well it's changed now lol you're welcome

I'm taking this weekend to get all the rest I can get. I'm freaking exhausted.
Only way you'll know is if I merely drop hints or give you the necessary vibe. Otherwise I'm good at playing dumb. 
Dark skin women can catch all of this.
I feel the same.  
@mellowtoo_hype you clearly deserve better man. I told you that before you even got hired. You should start looking for diff ones.
@mellowtoo_hype only difference is they're slaving you with hours. Other than that they both serve no pay checks.
Not even arguable 
His dad got him right lol that's low key probably all he needed.

I hate when a dude be so insecure over his girl when I ain't even checking for her. My nigga if I really wanted her you think she be wit u?
I might have to run a couple of niggas some fades this summer....
@aCHANTILLb right. Sad thing about it is that I always attract taken girls for some reason smh. I hate it
Dawg listen... 
@aCHANTILLb exactly and I wouldn't have run some niggas any fades just because he insecure
@JustCallMeGucci always
I'd say at least 3 to 4, not 2 though 
@aCHANTILLb I just tweeted about this too. Likewise, unless I've known you before you got cuffed.
Random selfie I guess 
Unless I've known you before you got cuffed
Don't come around or follow me if you have a boyfriend. I mean that.
When you see a fine ass girl you contemplate on following but you see she's taken 
Ultron was an excellent villain though.
On the lowest of keys 
I understand Amanda's decision. I definitely feel like North Carolina isn't for me anymore.
Avengers 2 was dope. I liked the original more though.
If I save up enough money sometime this summer maybe I'll book a hotel room so I could spend the weekend in Charlotte.
Black People vs Niggers will forever be the GOAT. Look it up

I'm slightly in the mood for a session of truth or dare.
‚Äú@_eboniwalker: If I knew 3 years ago what I know now about college, I wouldn't have came.‚Äù Swear to God I wouldn't have either.
Fuck....now I'm livid as hell. Talk to yall later.
People's overbearing urgency messes up so many things that it becomes beyond irreparable.
I have all my life to indulge in monogamous relationships and maybe have a kid or two. The fuck I gotta be in a rush for?
@CierraVEGAS_ they don't hear you on this though.
@aheroamongmen time only trying so hard to make some shit stick if you know it won't.
@aheroamongmen if you couldn't hear yourself over a beat would you rap over it? It's all about vibes and stuff man. You're only wasting your
@NYCPriest ......no. You're piccolo
If Ced and Swavey are brothers, then I'm that one annoying ass cousin you can't help but love.
Been my favorite word lol 
@_BadPuttyTat they did though lmao in that time almost everybody was buff af
@aheroamongmen but honestly could you really imagine him over those beats? I think he knew what he was doing.
Dark skin women are the goat. Idk what he's talking about  
@WelcometoAshia lmaoooo okay I got you
@WelcometoAshia except you lol I keep forgetting you're a Taurus

@BlissfulAllure lmaoooo I'm glad you got your day started right
@myprettieass I'm chilling lol
@myprettieass lol at least you admit
@myprettieass LMAOOO Ima pray for bruh jk
@myprettieass because we're too much alike lol
@myprettieass all facts
@myprettieass lol I don't see how tbh though. But we are smh
I ain't meet a Taurus woman that was friendly yet. YALL are the devil if anything
At least you see this  
@myprettieass EXPLAINS WHY!!! I CANT STAND YALL!
@myprettieass lol what sign are you?
@myprettieass explain.
Capricorns are not the Devil bruh. Lie again.
@mellowtoo_hype but why is this shit so spot on though?
@mellowtoo_hype I ain't satan bruh lmaoo
.....bruh yall ain't about to keep coming for my sign lol 
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it, institutionalized I can still kill me a nigga.
I wanna go to STL sometime this summer. I miss my city
We should never gave, we should never gave you niggas money go back home. Money go back home.
Every nigger is a staaaaar
I'm catching it first thing in the am. I've been slacking on movies period smh  
@Kashdra not every woman are this straightforward though
@Naysha080 lol fair enough
@_xKweenKay fair enough
@_xKweenKay we need more straightforward girls like you. What if a guy texts you that he wants sex?
@Naysha080 <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE> give us at least one phrase
Mine too smh  
@_cocainepapi wish I met more girls that was this blunt
I wonder what women do to let a nigga know they tryna have sex?
@aheroamongmen yup nor did he ruin it. Which is why I'm a bit conflicted about it
@aheroamongmen yeah it's like it wasn't a bad verse but it was a bit unnecessary. But at least he didn't ruin it.
I love Coffee but I honestly prefer the original version over the latest one.
I got a Midwest, northern, and southern mixed accent. Basically I can fit anywhere.
It ain't that bad lol  
@iamkimmie25 EXACTLY and my school was small af so I hated it. But honestly I just don't like to feel limited with anything in general.
@iamkimmie25 I was always down to mess with females from other schools lol honestly I'd rather do everything outside of my environment.
Come to think of it I didn't really get noticed by girls like that in high school until mid-junior year.
@nachash_ YOU REAL AS SHIT lol that's exactly how I feel.
@iamkimmie25 a lot of my homies had sex with those girls. And I don't like fucking the same chicks my homies have. Makes me feel weird.
@iamkimmie25 that's another reason I waited too. I didn't like what it was doing to people afterwards so I wanted no parts of it.
@nachash_ EXACTLY. I mean honestly idc about body count but you shouldn't try to put everyone in a box bc you feel left out.
@iamkimmie25 nah lmao I didn't really get any play in high school plus I hated the girls that went to my school.
And I'm nowhere near 40 lol so idk what she's talking about.
I was a virgin all throughout high school. Soooo where you tryna get at?  
@Leekz_So_Swavey ain't that the mf truth
@Leekz_So_Swavey welp lol responsibility first
It's been a hectic few weeks. I might just take some shots just so I can celebrate.
@Leekz_So_Swavey idk about that
I respect it though. Bruh took a break then approached the game differently. Can't blame him for that.
@Leekz_So_Swavey twist locked up, chuckee flew under the radar after he left YM, and ISSA I have no clue.
@Leekz_So_Swavey LMAOOO I slick thought I was the only one that noticed that.
@Leekz_So_Swavey Jacquees made the track actually quite smooth. His version was better than Dej Loaf's.
@_coolbeanz no juice. Just in general
I feel like I don't wanna be in another relationship no time soon. Im just coasting....but of course there are women that feel otherwise.
@AdoreeeKi I'm stepping out of it slowly.
@AdoreeeKi plus I've always encountered women that were shallow and cutthroat so it just somewhat discouraged me from trying it.
@AdoreeeKi ehh I'll just wait and see the vibe is right
@AdoreeeKi then there's another chance that she'll do it in such a cruel way...like lead you on or play you.
@AdoreeeKi Ive never wanted to receive the worse of it so I'd rather not approach at all or wait for her to let me know that she interested
@BlissfulAllure it's no problem
@AdoreeeKi there's different types of rejection. Truth that sinks deep and outright low key cold ones
@_coolbeanz I can't sleep when I'm hungry
@BlissfulAllure you're so gorgeous lol
Honestly, is there something to be scared about when approaching women other than different degrees of rejection?
@_coolbeanz lol gn
@_cocainepapi at least you witnessing it.
@_cocainepapi not every woman likes it though.
@_cocainepapi nope. How will I prosper with women if I don't try? I've gotten better about it over time.
@_coolbeanz nope
Tbh I still be deeply terrified to approach women, because I'd rather myself save the embarrassment if they're cutthroat.
@_coolbeanz not everyone thinks I do lol
I honestly used to be terrified to try women because of how cutthroat and evil they can be.
@iamkimmie25 nothing lol
@iamkimmie25 <EYES><EYES><EYES>
@iamkimmie25 lmao good luck with that
@_coolbeanz I'm not lying lol
@_coolbeanz just reminding you lol
Sex is mental because
Teamwork
Comfort
Communication 
Understanding

Just the main points that are required.
@_coolbeanz and I don't
Sex is a lot more mental than physical. It's tricky but once you get used to it it's smooth sailing from there.
@iamkimmie25 I agree with that too. Sex is about teamwork. That's what some people don't understand about it.
For ME, sex ain't sex unless I know I've done my job to satisfy the woman.
@_cocainepapi yeah that's true too. Some actually do take longer to cum and they can't help that.
@iamkimmie25 it's all about comfort and learning the girl's body. It's not hard at all. Niggas just selfish as fuck.
@iamkimmie25 honestly that's why I always ask a woman beforehand is she sure that she's down for it before I lay it down?
@_cocainepapi I don't see how you won't. It's easy. Just learn the girl's body. Not that hard.
Still can't believe that there's women that legit has not came from sex before. What kinda fluke ass niggas y'all be fuckin with?
@iamkimmie25 not you. Lol
So many women on Twitter are petty and shallow that it scares tf outta me.
Call me weird but I can't get jiggy with a chick I feel like I gotta lie to to get in bed with. I'd rather get pussy the honest way.
If I have to lie to have sex with you  when there's many more that I could do it with, then I don't need you. Simple. Get out my presence.
If I have to lie to have sex with you  when there's many more that I could do it with, then I don't need you. Simple. Get out my presence.
@_MNISN_ right like he was on the voice or sumn lmao

I need answers  
@_TiffanyAndCo my case lmaoo
Capricorn  
@Leekz_So_Swavey @aheroamongmen shoulda been quiet bruh
@nachash_ idk about you but I can back my ish up. Ask about me.
@NYCPriest I just started to grow into it a few weeks ago lol
@Naysha080 nope that's you. Lol I can't do it
@nachash_ yup
Now I see why I stopped chewing gum....I'm hungry as hell and I can't sleep when I'm hungry.
@nachash_ it ain't your beard unless you sit on it
@nachash_ your beard huh? Still on that? Lol
@nachash_ EXACTLY. She gotta die!
@nachash_ lol you haven't
@nachash_ scary thing is you never know if a person is fucked up until later.
@nachash_ same reason I hate when girls tell me I have nice lips. It makes me uncomfortable for some reason.
@Kashdra smh it just made me mad
@nachash_ smh that just took me back to the days where I wouldn't really wanna get deep with a woman so I could avoid shit like that.
@iamkimmie25 or chopped up. She playing with my life at that point. So it's only right she loses hers.
@nachash_ I really wanted to myself. That's my education you playing with bitch. Don't fuck with it over some petty bullshit.
@Kashdra nah she asking to get killed. Don't play with my education over some petty ass fuck shit. I will legit kill you out here.
#LRT .....so why is that bitch alive?
But if you are having sex, you shouldn't shame others that does tell as long as they don't go into deep detail about it.
I feel like most people be having sex. They maybe just don't believe in letting everybody know if they are or not.
@_DatniggaDrew most definitely
@_DatniggaDrew lmaoooooo that's motivation for you though
@________Ash preciate that
@_DatniggaDrew definitely. I can do it. It's just matter of getting myself to do it you know?
@geez_gab <RAISED FIST>üèæ<GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@_KPossible <RAISED FIST>üèæ appreciate you Kim
@_DatniggaDrew yeah my body adjusts very quickly if I allow it to enough.
@Kashdra appreciate that ma'am
@_DatniggaDrew cardio wise.
@_DatniggaDrew I'm starting to think that's my case. Like I've been told that I'm strong af, but I rarely use weights. I'm just outta shape
I'm about to check out. Final at 8am. Wish me luck guys.
@_DatniggaDrew lol that's true as hell. Or some don't even need weights to make themselves stronger.
@_DatniggaDrew that's true. So it just depends on body type basically?
@geez_gab I'm starting this weekend.
@_DatniggaDrew you mind giving a couple of tips brother?
Honestly I just wanna be cut. Not necessarily muscular though.
I'm tryna get these abs crackin by mid June. Mid July at the latest.
@_blackgirlFLY @checkmah_FRENCH everything is gonna be okay. Believe me.

@ohtayy_ oh I didn't see that lol
Oh and @chancetherapper but he'll probably drop it on some Beyonc√© shit lol throw us all the way off.
I'm still waiting to hear from @isaiahrashad too. It's been way too long.
All of these artists dropping such heat but I'm still waiting to hear from @SZA. I'm anxious to hear the next joint she drops.
June 30th is when Miguel's album dropping. Can't wait
@iamkimmie25 I don't lol
Stop 
DBZ is overrated though. I only really love it because it's what I grew up on.
@rebellious_loc but if he doesn't then leave it be.
@rebellious_loc regardless you shouldn't worry so much about it. That could drive them to do it. And I'm still in Durham
@_jeszsell what if he never does though? You can't force anybody to stay loyal, but if he does choose to be then it's all gravy.
@_coolbeanz .....
@rebellious_loc really giving it a chance to grow if you worry about that too much
@rebellious_loc you just gotta trust them to do right. Can't let that kinda shit infiltrate the relationship you two have formed. You're not
@rebellious_loc I honestly would not care. If she chose me and is doing her part, then why would I worry about the other niggas?
@beautyandbliss1 that's a good point as well
@blesseddceleste honestly I feel like there's nothing to really worry about if he isn't but that's just my opinion. I understand though.
@_jeszsell but does it really mean anything if he isn't giving em any attention?
@rebellious_loc it's understandable and I actually feel you on that part. Can't beat em over the head about it though
@_coolbeanz how do I? I don't see it
@_coolbeanz @blesseddceleste never had em. Idk what you talking about
Having hoes really don't mean shit if I'm not giving them the attention they want.
@blesseddceleste explains why Ciyana always thought I had hoes. But it doesn't really matter if he isn't giving em attention.
@_jeszsell explains why my ex always accused me of having hoes
Lmao  
Hmmm ladies this true?  
@Leekz_So_Swavey @mellowtoo_hype iight I'll be there
@mellowtoo_hype @Leekz_So_Swavey iight. Catch you around 3

@KingUlyssesIV @mellowtoo_hype same thing I'm saying. Girl obviously just feeding off of responses at this point.
@mellowtoo_hype man leave that be. It's not even worth it.
@mellowtoo_hype @Moca_NoLatte I'm done with this. Not even worth it.
@Moca_NoLatte @mellowtoo_hype .....what does that have to do with this? I'm not even about to waste my time with you.
@mellowtoo_hype girls like her prolly never get any play <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> that's prolly the reason she's sex shaming
@mellowtoo_hype more like she's been tryna bully niggas and feels superior for some odd reason.
@mellowtoo_hype @Leekz_So_Swavey that's why I just mentioned you lol
@mellowtoo_hype why do she keep unblocking you to keep talking shit? She got problems
@rebellious_loc @_MNISN_ at least you leaving now
@rebellious_loc @_MNISN_ 
I'm honestly not tryna see Smith today. But at least this the only day I'll be there.

@obsessher or I guess they are never satisfied
@obsessher I feel like it is too. Dealing with that many women is beyond stressful.
Nigga who has the time to deal with that many women? Isn't one enough, especially if she's worrisome herself?
@KZUNCH they said Caps, Taurus, and Scorpios
I guess that's why I've never really had sex with multiple people at the same time. I don't have the time or patience to deal with that much
Facts. I get annoyed easily as it is lol I'm solid with one partner at a time.

@Kashdra keyword: most.
@________Ash exactly but it's no problem
Bruh I legit just wanna travel but niggas too comfortable to the point of not feeling the need to explore.
@AdoreeeKi lol glad I can take credit for that
@________Ash they pushed to have more time to develop it. I was pissed when I found out too.
@AdoreeeKi that's how I've always looked at it lol
@________Ash January of 2016
Crazy how much juice you can accumulate if you're not in spotlight on the regular.
@SincerelyLegit yup. It's cool though
@_mellowlifee yet people still love us for some reason lol
@AdoreeeKi pretty much like raw sex
@SincerelyLegit I'm single. You late.
I honestly don't see how can a guy like me could have juice. I'm a boring homebody ass nigga. I don't like people and I value space a LOT.
Having juice doesn't really mean shit if it isn't even welcomed like that.
I don't even like attention like that. So most of my "juice" are from people I want no parts of in that way.
Having juice is hella overrated.
Mine  
Miguel is definitely the most consistent singer/artist out right now. It seems like he gets better with every project.
Miguel is just that dude. Coffee is flames.
@iamkimmie25 probably a different one. But me too

@_KPossible I hope so
@beautyandbliss1 @FuckPUSHA @_Sandrenna Durham in one sentence.
@_KPossible just don't know where to start
@iamkimmie25 unfortunately I made that fatal mistake. Because of that I don't even have any desire to look at a paper these days.
@iamkimmie25 ahh I used to love writing until I started college
@_KPossible I'm horrible with that. Smh that's why I rather stay quiet and wallow in my thoughts.
@iamkimmie25 just what I'm going through right now. <CONFUSED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE> it sucks
@iamkimmie25 I haven't quite found that outlet yet.
@_KPossible I don't even understand myself at times lol that's why I wanna just go back to my quiet days but that's long gone

Don't take it serious unless it's a chick you met in person and it's mutual.

S u r f a c e   L e v e l   I n t e r p r e t a t i o n.
And for the memo, body count doesn't mean shit. It's quite na√Øve to think that it does.
Niggas be real live saying they want a freak of a gf or wife, but don't want the shit that comes with it. Make up your mind fam.
Could mean a lot. Mind elsewhere, low stamina, ain't had it in a while or first time.  
Ever wonder what the afterlife would be like?
Catch a movie or two.
I think Ima go by southpoint for a lil bit today.
.......Ima act like I didn't even see that.
I'm more afraid of life than I am of death. Death is inevitable. Life isn't.
Sign of desperation  
@geez_gab how you gon get it though
I just wanna watch anime and have sex all day......
@geez_gab XL
What size?  
Questionable appearance or not, y'all still throw the box at him lol
Denzel Washington is 60 years old, paid, and married. You really think he about to give any fucks about how he looks now?
@itskmurda that happens to me often lol
I'll remember the words if I listen to it.  
Same. The more I listen to it, the more the messages of the album sticks with me.  
Who went to the first service of Freebandz?
Oh 
Piercings period 
@mellowtoo_hype @_MNISN_ @DatGuyDre15 alas, we have our guest speaker Future Mayweather who has blessed us with sanctified hits
You gotta understand this is a new generation. People's expectations are way lower now than it was back then. 
Fight was corny, but maybe I'm biased since I'm not really a fan of boxing.
@TheMavsQueen Grizzlies ain't no slouch though
@DatGuyDre15 you don't like James Harden?
@melissajownz lol appreciate that ma'am
@melissajownz lol how so?
Every time I see a girl smile at me and it's beautiful most of my sense leaves my brain for a few seconds.
My ultimate weakness is women with beautiful smiles. Bruh....<WEARY FACE><WEARY FACE>
I'm more anxious to see the outcome of this Clippers/Spurs game than I am for the boxing match
By far the most depressing thing ever  
Sex stories are fun to tell because that's the best time you can see someone over exaggerate it and it's accepted lmao.
@_coolbeanz I ain't gon tell you again now...
@DatGuyDre15 @mellowtoo_hype that'll the second service
@mellowtoo_hype @DatGuyDre15 with the choir singing the word of Future....Monster?

Unfrosted Pop Tarts.....I'm so....baffled at this......
This nigga said unfrosted Pop Tarts.......
NIGGA UNFROSTED?!  
Here you go with the TV mess again lol  
I probably still would hit though
That tattoo throws it off tbh 
Easily 
@DatGuyDre15 of course I would. Lol it's one of my favorite songs
@DatGuyDre15 bio the GOAT
I'm going for Pacquiao but I don't think he's gonna win.
@BasedGodd3ss original Cheerios aren't though
Sugar on Cheerios or Frosted Flakes is the shit.
You don't like em with Cheerios?  
If you've got an opinion that you truly believe in, own it and stand behind that shit. Don't bitch up because you're afraid of disagreement.
@Kashdra hmm never knew that
@Kashdra they're basically giving the impression that they have no confidence in what they're saying
@Kashdra wym?
I don't see the point of saying "don't mention me" if you've already stated your opinion to the public.
Vitamin C is so clutch when you have a cold.
@mellowtoo_hype OH
I'm thinking about getting a tat or two in the near future. Just don't know of what yet.
Nigga that shit be amazing  
Same lol I'll feign ignorance with the quickness 
@Tariku__ nah lol it's Twitter. Just the same ol shit
Lmao see me when I get back then  
You ain't gotta brag my nigga 
When I'm sick I go OD with the OJ. I plays no games when it comes to recovery.
Not a damn thing tbh 
It's low key messed up but I digress 
Yall acting up on the TL is 2:45 in the afternoon. Nasty selves lmao
90% of Twitter  
She shoulda stayed her prissy ass at home  
That moment where you realize the girl you used to mess around with is now dating one of your high school homies 
21 &amp; 5'11 
Would you start doing evil in order to nurture the spirit?
@mellowtoo_hype @OGFASA oh FUCK NO nvm
@mellowtoo_hype what's pegging
@CestMoi_Val happy birthday ma'am! Enjoy yourself
Everything comes back in full circle. Just know that.
Now I'd be wrong if I started throwing shade or talked reckless for the TL, but fortunately that isn't and never was my style.

I don't flirt cuz I don't want nobody else + that's endangering anoth‚Ä¶
@mellowtoo_hype come outside of Liston
@mellowtoo_hype I have nothing planned. Wassup
I ain't got the time or patience for insecurity. Swing that shit towards my way and we'll have problems.
Lemme make my way back to Liston
People take that social media shit a lil too serious lol
Or to form a business.  
It'll be Saturday then lol 
Unfortunately 
Yall make social media way bigger of an issue than it actually is. So in reality, it's YOUR fault. Take responsibility for once.
Niggas been disrespecting their own relationships waaaaaay before social media was even thought of. Don't blame Twitter, blame he/she.
that's not a social media thing, that's a respect ‚Ä¶
Can't win in the relationship game if you rather take the easy way out before you actually give someone a chance.
People could be totally different from what they are on social media. Some do it for fun, some for business purposes. Can't put ppl in a box
Ladies, we need answers.  
@Leekz_So_Swavey watch how many says yes
@aCHANTILLb maybe we're just too headstrong lol
You can't sway em bro. You're talking to a wall.  
I ain't saying a Cap and Sag can't work. It's just that shit is hella rough. When it's good, it's really good. When it's bad, it's TERRIBLE
@aCHANTILLb lmao I'm over exaggerating but speaking from experience as well. Yall great as friends but relationship? Very questionable
Lose a hand if you want to.  
@_mellowlifee and trust and believe I socialize but it never goes well with me, so I'd rather just do my own thing than get dragged down.
@_mellowlifee so. In my honest opinion it ain't that I'm introverted; it's more so I don't really like people. Or even trust them.
@_mellowlifee well I'm not really close minded lol and I'm a Cap. And i won't deny that id rather do my own thing but I'll get help if need
Soon as I touch down in Durham first thing I'm doing is swaggin through Krispy Kreme. It's been too long.
@_mellowlifee what's wrong with that?
@DeeCeeSniper damn. Somebody did yall dirty lol
A relationship with a Sagittarius is something even worse than Hell. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
@DeeCeeSniper which one?
@ImNotaPlayerTho true. What's ya favorite one to talk about?
@_mellowlifee lmao why not? I agree though
@ImNotaPlayerTho ahh okay lol is that one true?

Watching the last episode of Sons of Anarchy is making me fall in love with the show all over again.

@DonTouchMyAfro <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> let it be great
Apparently I have the appearance and demeanor of a boyfriend.....because people STAY asking me if I talk to or dating someone.
@DonTouchMyAfro lmao what's wrong with it
@nachash_ lmao don't be like that.
By far one of the most irritating things.  
@nachash_ the problem is maintaining it lol it's annoying as hell sometimes. I gotta go to the barbershop damn near every week
@LODYCASH @Zatoven15 he's doing a movie for DC comics....Suicide Squad
@nachash_ I don't like having a big beard. Doesn't really fit my appearance
Yeah beard trim coming soon.

Cherry Bomb was horribly mixed I'll admit that. But it was still pretty good in its own right.
@TheOreoAdmiral lmaoo ok man. To each his own
I'm so mad I didn't see this blasphemy last night  
I get sick more easily in the spring more than I do in the winter.....wtf yo
I ain't bumping Rae Sremmurd on the daily but they do serve their purpose...and that's to make party music.
Niggas just wanna be upset for the sake of being upset.
ANYTHING 
I feel like that's one of my generation's major downfalls. Everyone's too anxious to be grown that they forget to appreciate life.
@creative94era I agree with that as well. Just wanted to add on to it.
Women, y'all gotta learn to not force that kinda stuff on men, regardless of age.
@iamkimmie25 nah I was saying I wish I could take it.
Guys that are in their 20s typically aren't looking for relationships either. Not until their late 20s to early 30s 
My life.  
Message!

You hip

I can't fade traveling over 30 mins for some box that I could easily not be getting.
@LexingtonDrive_ if it's past 20 miles then that's box that isn't that serious to me.
I'm nowhere near sleepy....
Tbh 
I'm low key ready to head to Durham. Charlotte ain't been good to me these past few months.
See....this is why niggas like me don't need a sex drive as high as mine. I be ready to lose my mind if I go without it for too long.
@LexingtonDrive_ I'll try lol
@LexingtonDrive_ Ima try to....but if my instincts are right I feel like Ima go crazy soon
@LexingtonDrive_ smh we'll rebound from it soon though <RAISED FIST>üèæ
Sex is a dope thing and all but I think ima refrain from it for a while.....at least try to.
@LexingtonDrive_ the whole nine lol emotional roller coaster
This my life basically 
@LexingtonDrive_ lmao shit be playing with your whole emotions
Low key.

@MUHFUGGINJKELLS I've never felt like this until now smh this ain't the wave
@SincerelyLegit that mess is the blow lol like I be legit just wanna patch it up bc of that.
Y'all ever wanted to have sex even though you're not really on good terms with the person you wanna fuck?
I actually like talking to females I don't have to hold back with. Lord knows that isn't the wave for someone like me.

Shit don't make sense.
This shit is wild annoying. Then they wonder why the nigga don't wanna deal with em much afterwards  
@55mmbae yeah or maybe I just had too much going on at the time for me to really focus on it.
I still think that The Shield has the best pilot ever.
That show is kinda slow to me.  
Y'all insist on asking niggas to the Lakers so bad.... WHEN WILL YALL UNDERSTAND NO ONE LIKES THE LAKERS? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

I hate when people say we're in the last days. I don't believe in none of that. It maybe all fucked up but we've always landed on our feet.
@c_c_brown3 everything will be alright. Things will always get worse before they get better.
Don't say that. We've down before. Can't go nowhere but up.

Question of the night  
I could use a long hug my damn self.
@geez_gab no prob <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@geez_gab *air hugs*
This nap looking like it'll suffice for the time being
@_blackgirlFLY <UNAMUSED FACE> still stingy and stubborn I see
@_blackgirlFLY we can share!! &gt;:(
Just because you're attracted to someone doesn't mean you have to take action every single time.
@_blackgirlFLY lol make sure you look out for a young brother will ya?
@_blackgirlFLY pic or nah?
@BackThtCHASS_Up exactly. No need to pressed about anything at all.
@BackThtCHASS_Up unfortunately we didn't work out. But I still appreciate her and what she did for me.
@_coolbeanz you forgot I'm a r&amp;b head lol
@BackThtCHASS_Up unfortunately that's a bad habit of ours. However, with the right girl y'all can soften us, just like I'm soft a bit now <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Emotions by H Town 
@BackThtCHASS_Up to relax and let the girl love you. And to not be an asshole lol
@BackThtCHASS_Up lmaoooo we can't escape that arrogant stigma for nothing smh. But Pisces and caps are good matches. Caps just gotta learn
@BackThtCHASS_Up lol idk what it is about yall that keeps me coming back
@BackThtCHASS_Up January 3rd
@Leekz_So_Swavey you don't understand smh
I can't duck Pisces, Cancer, or Sagittarius women to save my life smh.
Cancers hella deep on my TL today. The hell going on?
Why everyone say that Caps are mean? Lol I actually think we're the nicest of the zodiac.
@TheHoneyBee_ none at all. I'm going to the next room so I won't be bothered
Forever aggravating  
@BecauseYouLuvMe this is real talk lol
LMAOOOO 
Especially I've been going to sleep no later than 11 lately. You can definitely miss me with that.
Guess I'm spending half of my night in the library. I ain't staying past 8 though. That's dead af.
Every man got that one female friend they would give the illest pipe to under the right circumstances.
This is real talk lol  
If I do happen to get married, my wife gotta understand that pulling out is a sin with me.
Having a high sex drive is only great when you're fucking on a regular basis.
Having a high sex drive can be a gift and a curse.
Few weeks ago. And dope af 
@_MNISN_ thought it was just me
Neck kisses. Having my bottom lip bitten  
Talking shit yeah 
Oral, neck sucking 
Of course. Wouldn't be sex without it 
Yup to both  
Nope. NEVER 
Doesn't matter

@_jeszsell it's been one of my favorite cuts off the album since its release. I can just relate to it more now
@_jeszsell been bumping it since last night
I loved SZA for that hook.
@_JoAlexandria been on repeat since last night

That fear of rejection mess ain't finna cut it. Girls real live be acting like guys don't be scared to approach them.
@empresscristos3 no problem
@nesssayvettee ahh okay
@empresscristos3 lol it'll be okay
@nesssayvettee which one happens more for you?
All I'm saying is, men AND women, have all the sex you want. Just be smart about it.
Speaking of which, ladies I got a question: do you prefer to have sex with a guy that's experienced or not experienced?
Only reason why I lost my virginity because I knew girls hated guys that had no experience. Otherwise I would've kept my shit.
Ask and you shall receive. Keep that in mind ladies.
You can't get mad at someone for not recognizing you if they didn't know you liked them due to you keeping a closed mouth.
I actually condone it. Guys shouldn't have to do it every single time.  
Not going over this body count situation because it's pretty much like beating a dead horse at this point.
@empresscristos3 lol you was going through it weren't you?
@DatGuyDre15 
@DatGuyDre15 the troll is real at 940 am
Anything is fair game.  
Unfortunately it is 
@empresscristos3 lmao go to bedc

@TheOreoAdmiral 
#JCSU19 understand this 
Granted I miss her. But it just couldn't work out right now. I still have a lot of love for her and there's no bad blood on both ends.
@_eboniwalker that's how you make the relationship unbalanced. That's basically a waste of time.
@jAyNeLLy_ it didn't really set in with me until earlier today
@jAyNeLLy_ no
And it's so sad to see that.  
Seriously, why are y'all afraid to be alone? You have to be able to stand on your own two feet in order to make the partnership stable.
@rebellious_loc that's all you can do
@rebellious_loc glad you woke up <WINKING FACE>
I don't understand why y'all feel like you HAVE to be in a relationship. You don't HAVE to do shit. It's totally fine to be single. Relax.
@iamkimmie25 right lol
@iamkimmie25 lol nothing to cry about. It was mutual on both ends
@iamkimmie25 not as of a couple days ago
@iamkimmie25 nah
Annoyance on purpose 
Black as the heart of a fuckin Aryan 
Don't know of any.  
Missionary. I like to look at their sex faces lol  
A lot of stuff I wouldn't do lol 
Single 
Smart, independent, understanding 
Smile, curves, face 
Nah 
If I have gut instinct and I happen to be right, it'll unfold itself either way  
Just cut em off the moment I find out  
Disloyalty  
Hmm can't think of any  
Modern or in general?  
School 
Idk 
Too many things 
5'11 and 220 
Couldn't find a common ground anymore.  
If it's under the right terms sure.  
North Carolina

So many things are out of control....just gotta wash my hands of it and let God handle it. Or fate I guess.
I'm thinking I should do the same.  
.....just like that I've been snapped back into reality.
If I could meet some dope people in Durham over the summer, I'll be satisfied.
‚Äú@OGBEARD: My niggas twitpic your reaction when you beat even tho you didn't meet any of her preferences.‚Äù 
@Coolest_KIDD it's different. Can't wait to see what Leto does with this role
I actually like this look 
America was built off of violence and hunger for power. What the fuck is peace?
Snapchat is only solid if you want thirst traps or nudes tbh
@BadGalZorra no problem <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Ion fool with Snapchat like that. I just look at certain peoples snap and call it a day. Other than that it's boring af
Swaggin to the cafe with my cargos wrinkled like fuck it
We all have done certain shit just to grab someone's attention. No need to front about it.
Exactly why I don't even indulge in these arguments anymore.  
@mellowtoo_hype me too. Catch you in a few
@mellowtoo_hype you swaggin to the cafe
