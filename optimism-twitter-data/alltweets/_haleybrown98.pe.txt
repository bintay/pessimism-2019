I am dead

someone help 
10000x worse thx for "loving" me
haha...my life is a joke
<SLEEPY FACE> 
you literally never know what you have until it's gone...
have to take a break from leadership and worship...
like I have people there that support me and if I can't go there what if they forget about me and I'll have noone
the fact that today might be my last day at my church actually makes me that scared and anxious and depressed
when you're parents react way better than you thought...k
<CURLY LOOP> 
oh my fucking God, everyone knows
last night tho 
I hate my life. I am literally done.
and myself may I add
I just fucking cut my hair
I give up

Shit.. i guess i once again abandoned that fake girl act
Accurate 

"Here- kari jobe" is meant to be calming but its not
Im so pathetic i made this into a venting page again... but this time i only blocked people from school but not church
Im literally so tempted right now to finish what i started last night this is complete bullshit
but regardless the pressure is bullshit
the only reason i can think of not to break my skin is the fact i wanna live up to everyones expectations of me
when someone makes you feel like shit &amp; look like a joke...ur not ok
I can relate so damn muchhhh 
well breakdowns are fun
im her last priority
Maybe i am pushing her away... i didn't even realise it, how can i stop if i dont even know what im doing wrong
@_haleybrown98 wait that makes no sense i mean im going to have an attack if people find out
It sucks, like what will people think if they find out im on meds for anxiety, im going to have anxiety
Im a anxiety drug junkie now...
Finally got chicken nuggets <TWO HEARTS>
Day off school is gud as
I told nan about my anxiety and im not sure why
2 hawt hot dayummmm

I feel seriously sick to my stomach
I confesses one of the hardest things to my bestfriend and i trust her but why do i regret it and why do i feel worse
Do i even have one friend.. is she forreal
Torturing myself on insta looking at peoples pics bc they have lives and i dont
It is both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so deeply.
@samanthasicex @gxvinlee i feel you so deeply
Well today has been a waste of time
Finding these on my phone from a road trip with dad #swagmoney 
Camping antics 
morning praise break!!!

Jesus really is the centre of my life 
Don't try to make yourself beautiful on the outside, with stylish hair or by wearing gold jewelry or‚Ä¶ 
Just got told I have a perfect nose, awhh

Shame about no life groups this week but we have "Dream Bigger" to make up for it! @bevankay is going‚Ä¶ 
Nan's trying to tell me it's just the thought of going to school is what stops me but no, it's actually not, i hate it altogether
@amylouisedeal my names haley, but does it matter who i am haha?
do dogs poo in the house while we're asleep or do they just hold it in all night??
probably*** wow
i porbably have more but they only make an effort if i choose to be in their presence
why do i feel like i only have 1 actual friend...?
people that dont have a bio are the worst
@thesethbishop care to enlighten me?
because i actually feel so uncomfortable around these people, but i will feel bad if i dont go because she wants me there and it's her day
i just lied to my friend about not being able to make it to her party till like 3, just because i want to minimize the time i spend there
okay this is enough. goodnight <SLEEPING FACE>
i just spent a minute or 2 contemplating whether 'shoe' was the correct way to spell the word 'should'
atleast i can say i'm doing way better than 2 weeks ago, i was actually a wreck
what am i saying it's 4:30am in the morning
Be Patient. God's timing is perfect.
@amylouisedeal yes he is
we were born models

im awake anyways but i do want to sleep, i'm just not tired enough.. or i might me overtired
i feel like reading my bible but if i do i know i'll be reading it for hoursss

IF HE GOES TO THE LEFT THEN WE GO TO THE LEFT
IF HE GOES TO THE RIGHT THEN WE GO TO THE RIGHT
WE'RE GONNA JUMP JUMP JUMP JUMP IN THE RIVER
we're falling into deeper waters, calling out to you
we're walking into deeper waters, going after you
i don't even know why it's funny but it just is, but it really shouldn't be
it's funny because i have a party today and i'm still awake
like i think it's because it makes me sound more truthful but i don't even do it on purpose
i actually say the word 'actually' waaay too much
there is actually no photos of me or with me in them on my insta and i'm actually laughing
i dont even know why i am awake
deep cries out is on constant repeat

Our God is an all consuming fire|| Hebrews 12:29 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è #createdtolive #tytkb

@AmyStack98 @Potterprincesss @jaydenwithcon where was this photo posted omg I might be in it
For our God is a consuming fire. (Hebrews 12:29 NKJV)
@ebonizzle @slayfati don't worry haha
@slayfati yeah true
@slayfati it is but I support it, but it's just me personally that's not gay
@slayfati oh I never was anything but straight, I just broke a 3 year attack of the devil
@slayfati what
@slayfati she's too hot, hot damn
<OK HAND SIGN>üèª<OK HAND SIGN>üèª<OK HAND SIGN>üèª 
@slayfati shotty the hottie in the back
I have the best bestfriend in the world yay
I'm stronger than I thought I was wow yay
atleast I know I'm straight now
wow I'm actually the biggest idiot
so I guess it's over....
it shouldn't be this hard
really omg
a fresh prince sesh sounds good right now, along with chicken nuggets of course...
starting the day off in a good mood, woop #thankyoujesus
and now I'm annoyed and hurt that she thinks it is okay and that she doesn't need to apologise and actually doesn't
I don't know what hurts worse, the fact that she actually thought I'd do that or the way she disrespected me so harshly
woah that honestly hurts...
I am sooooo lucky right now
wow yes 
i actually can't believe it
@ConMaynardaise dm me you're number and we might have more hope? haha
@ConMaynardaise of course I am!!
oh my God she did not just
@ConMaynardaise it only ends at like 10 the latest haha
my last tweet was literally like that infront of me for 10 minutes on my phone screen... I literally don't know how to explain how I feel
how
@slayfati that's actually amazing
@slayfati you're basically winning at life right now
@slayfati well then...
@slayfati oh cool congrats
@slayfati SLAYYYY
@slayfati good as, what in?
@slayfati I feel you man, my mums pushed me to the edge and it's only the 2nd day back
@ConMaynardaise but hey, are you going to be at United this Friday?
@ConMaynardaise thank you, so do i.... she's literally the only person I've wanted for almost 4 years (pretty pathetic I know)
@ConMaynardaise I wish it was that easy
I mean I can't be exactly like my favourite book charachter when she's okay with not being around me
how do I win her heart over?
how come my book is thicker than my packet of chicken nuggets
God loves you SO much|| nothing can change that|| Romans 5:8 <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
some substitute teachers are so unreasonable
when will my mum learn to take a hint, she only ever yells at me when I'm in a down mood... actually that's a lie, but she's much worse
atleast Im strong enough to resist temptations, thank the lord
she's just too perfect and hot and wow
hopefully I haven't fallen in too deep and hard that I can pick myself up again and move on but I don't see that happening
I just sent her a massive text that's soooo long and I told her I'm falling for her and if she says she doesn't feel the same idk
it's totally a different story up until now but I'm totally ruining everything and I don't know what I'd do if I lost her
I don't know whether the charachter send up together so I'm scared because if the book characters don't end up together, me and her wont
how come when I get so involved in a book series you feel serious emotions and obsess so much over a charachter, you become like them...
It sucks so much knowing I stuffed up and ruined everything with her
<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
I accidently read a book for 16 hours straight...
it wasn't that bad... 
@Pointless_Jodie @shortstackband @withconfidence_ @MoveOnBeStrong wow

like a lot of people are coming out with their cancer stories so you're probs wondering why I'm focusing on this specific dog story
like even that is a blessing from God to remind her it will be okay and it's okay that she's struggling
