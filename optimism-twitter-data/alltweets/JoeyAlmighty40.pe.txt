Music is such a beautiful thing man
@yvettelorrainee Houston,  the children one is in S.A.
Of course if I die, it kinda won't matter cause I mean... I'll be dead <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Live or die. I won't be the same person after this
St. Luke's...it's kinda funny how my city is where my life will change forever 
Really didn't know how weak my right side is, till now <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> fuck you strokes
My left side is my dominant now.
Hate this place 
Look at what yall are doing to yourselves... really. It really isn't even funny. Its just sad 
I got an appointment at the hospital in 6 hours... so yea I ain't sleeping
Morphine is a hell of a drug man, I've been at the hospital so many times. I'm surprised I'm not addicted to it already <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Pre-Order: 
Without the hospital helping me with morphine <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I forgot how sleeping in feels like
@JesseTwerks_ yea they are so small minded,  that they'll forget and start to make fun of it as soon as they see it again
@JesseTwerks_ it's the valley homie, it'll be "funny" for a long time
@JesseTwerks_ like No Type by Rae Sremmurd?
I assume twitter won't be safe for about 12 hours...
Yall make me sick, really
@Alondra_Moon @JesseTwerks_ don't scroll through anything,  just don't go to twitter for about 10 hours <THUMBS UP SIGN> no lie
Really though, like wtf? Why?!
@JesseTwerks_ @Alondra_Moon bro, like damn...I don't even know what to see. Like why would they even do that
@Abbeeeell cause they're childish, so they think it's all a game.
@Abbeeeell same thing I've been asking myself
@Alondra_Moon I suggest you get out of twitter before you find out. Save yourself,  trust me
Me: " EEEE PANCAKES!"
Dad:" no, im making tortas" 
Me:..... 
Yall people really have me like 
Would've been so much better if I didn't have to see that shit man...
@zachcaples8 @CruzIsaiah2 take his advice bro
@CruzIsaiah2 it's drama, nasty ass drama
Everyone has a different view point 
My tl is all fucked up right now <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
Instant reactions to my tl 
I'm just here like 
I'm done <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 

after seeing that shit this is all i can think of <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Where real niggas settled beef back in the day <OK HAND SIGN> 
@dakota_nuffsaid no one's useless homie. If that was true, I'd be dead for sure, in three different occasions <THUMBS UP SIGN> find yourself man
I'm blessed with so many things. That losing my mind at 55 doesn't even sound so bad anymore. Cause I know my friends will be there for me
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulations, but I know God
So if I can live through all of this...then you guys can live through a heart break. Through depression. Yall can do great things man
Loss of a mother, depression,  etc
Strokes, brain lesions, partially brain dead, a syndrome that can rapture a heart valve, seizures, heart breaks, memory loss, dementia
I've had it bad man
That you can conquer life
I'm going to be a living proof that life can through EVERYTHING at you. And through all of this, you can still accomplish great things.
@Jrod10_ thanks brotha <THUMBS UP SIGN>like I said,  we're gunna conquer. That's what God put us in this earth for. To conquer in our own way
My nigga just lifted up my mood man. I'm gunna live for yall. I've won 3 times, I can do it again. I won't die so easily
I need to survive this, I really do
It's true though,  I am kinda dead weight. Even if I do find a special someone, what we have 30 good years then there goes my mental health<DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Cause my dumbass self thinks that no one should ever have to carry this dead weight (aka me)
Knowing me, I'll probably push them away
It's hard to imagine that someone out there, is actually going to see something special in me.
Either things go really well, or really badly
Like 50/50 chances are pretty scary
Man, I'm honestly scared out of my mind.
I slur alot more. I stutter. I say words in a sentence that don't even belong there
And the answer is yes, I am. I will never be able to talk like how I used to
I shouldn't even be a grammar nazi, cause if you talk to me in person...you'll probably be like "wtf is wrong with this nigga? Is he mental?
@fernandor40 it's all good man <OK HAND SIGN> I've been fucking up a lot in my vocabulary lately
@fernandor40 perspective?
Got a appointment at the hospital anyways
If I survive,  it's gunna suck cause I'll be forgetting stuff little by little. So i won't be able to be a grammar nazi <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@JoeyAlmighty40 kinda*
Dying of boredom...literally...kind of...nah not really <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> kinds just dying cause of life 
Cause I know that if I survive this surgery, I'll probably be asleep all day during the 18th
Hopefully I get to live to see May 19th
If I survive till 55 <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I believe that by the time I'm 55, the only thing I'll remember will be cuss words
Man, my vocabulary is getting worse <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
5 times in less than 30 minutes...I think I'm about to die guys <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
@sarcastic_ivan I'm down <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
It hurts and feels so weird.
Have you ever got shocked with the socket in the wall outlet? Well that's how this feels, but all around my heart and chest
@sarcastic_ivan hopefully <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> that way I have badass music wherever I go <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Got shocked about 4 times by the chip. That's like a record <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I literally couldn't breathe <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
Not feeling good, ringing in my head hasn't stopped
Been listening to Apparently all day
@Alondra_Moon they did. Harden gave up since he knew he wasn't the MVP. He isn't playing like before
These aren't the same Rockets that beat the Mavs. They're playing like trash now.
@Alondra_Moon they're killing themselves, and the Clippers are taking those chances to kill the rockets.
It's like as soon as Harden found out he wasn't the MVP, the nigga just gave up
@Alondra_Moon Houston isn't the same team that beat the mavericks,  so even if they miraculously win the series. They don't deserve it
@Alondra_Moon honestly,  Clippers will most likely win the championship.  They're putting in work <OK HAND SIGN>
Bitting my lips desperately,  please don't get numb again
Cmon please don't do this again
Cmon, not this again
Woah
I'm glad one of my ex's is doing good <THUMBS UP SIGN> thank you for checking up on me.
I'm ready but not really 
Hey mom,  if things go bad for me during the surgery...I get to see you after so long <RELIEVED FACE> so I still win either way
A mother is the best blessing ever. And I've lost mine...please don't take yours for granted
Really man. 
It's either fight or die for my body that day <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
8 more days till Houston <ANGUISHED FACE>

I'm frustrated, 'bout to go Super Saiyan
I don't have no patience unless it's patients from playing operation
I'm castrating anybody that's hating
Music is the best remedy
And yea I'm a hypocrite too. I didn't say I loved myself though, did I?
Hypocritical people everywhere.  And I hate every single one of em.
Really hate people
Sad but true. Yall don't really appreciate your mothers. Yall just want the attention that posting about her gives 
... 
@littledebbiiee if they have a monkey,  I will adopt it from them <RELIEVED FACE><THUMBS UP SIGN>
If you're not with your mom today. Giving her all your attention. You're some type of monster
Sent you some flowers mom, hopefully my uncle drops them off

These people are testing my patience
I'm done putting other people in front of me
I need to conquer for them
I need to be strong for my lil sisters
Don't get hooked into someone, don't trust so easily.
Mood turned into meek mill and kanye
I'm done feeling sorry for myself. I'm done feeling period. With this blaze in me, I'm going to conquer.
Life and death will fear me after
I'm going to come back from this. I'm going to conquer
And this rage, did not just light my spark up again. This rage has lit me up, with an undying flame.
All my pain. All the suffering. I've made it into rage
I'm going to live, and I'm gunna be the greatest
I swear, I'm going to fucking overcome this surgery.
If I don't then,  we'll goodbye.
I want to be able to reply to those "just in case this is goodbye" texts...
These surgeons better be on their A game that day.

Happy Mother's Day momma...you are missed dearly
Okay now <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPY FACE>

Been telling myself this over and over.  
Not feeling it, nope. I'm just gunna do my best to knock out
Fuck this earth man. I hate what life has done to me. And it's all to try and mold me into something I don't want to be.
I just want to go home to you mom, I really do.
How much more do I have to endure man?
But how can I give you everything,  now that you aren't with me?
Momma you deserved everything
If yall have your mom with you...consider yourself so lucky
Typing a text to my mom for mothers day...even though I know the message won't go through...

Life is a bitch ain't it? But man is she beautiful
Beware at night, my demons come out and play
But yall wouldn't know that,  you buncha snakes <SNAKE>
Harsh truth is always better than a sweet lie
Tell me how your life is "bad". Humor me
I should've been dead thrice, and yall are complaining cause daddy doesn't want to give you some extra money.
It's scary how, I'm the one with a 7cm lesion and a dead spot in my brain...yet I'm smarter than alot of people. Both book and street smarts
This is real life. And life devours feelings away in a frenzy
Get outta here with your feelings
Game, set, match
And just like that, I won.
No remorse, not from me. No way
I'll push all your buttons and leave you feeling unworthy
Don't bring feelings into an argument,  cause I bring facts. You're not going to win with your feelings, trust me
Try me
@Isaandrade_7 @MugattiMeez loyalty is not even in the picture.
@Isaandrade_7 @MugattiMeez a real woman will get attention from a man if he's loyal,  and vice versa. Girls just want attention
I win, case closed
If it's "annoying", then it's obviously bothering you. And if it's bothering you, chances are that you are guilty of something.
@Isaandrade_7 @MugattiMeez elaborate on how I am wrong then? If it's "annoying"
I got a fucked up heart/ heartbeat, still counts as beautiful? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> 
Nothing but girls, that's all I see 
Wonder how I'd be if it wasn't for my mom's advice and the promise I made to her before she passed
Yea I'm not gunna sleep tonight
Hopefully I can sleep tonight, really don't want to start over thinking again
Been in and out of sleep all day

So this is my doctor. Man I hope you're ready for this Dr. Razavi 

#BillKlem
For some reason, when I was looking at lifeless self in that dream...I felt at peace. I wouldn't even consider this a nightmare
Seeing my lifeless body, telling my friends to cheer up. I mean they couldn't hear me cause I was dead, but you know... it was a weird dream
It's pretty fascinating how real this dream was
Had a dream I was at my own funeral...
Very true 
Will you swear on your life,
That no one will cry at my funeral?
Just open your eyes
And see that life is beautiful.
You can't learn to tell the truth
Until you learn to lie
You can't quit until you try
You can't live until you die
@sarcastic_ivan just saw...that guy is...just wow lol
@sarcastic_ivan like?
I'll be sending those texts about 2 hours before the surgery, just in case the worst comes to me.
I honestly have about 15-18 heart felt farewell texts, and still have many more to go.
@eminemismine313 oh haha, sorry. Not thinking straight right now
@eminemismine313 ?
I could be bleeding out, dying, etc. And my response will always be "I'll be alright" <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Wrastling_Ralph that would be the perfect way to end it all
"Are you okay"...no matter how fucked up I am, I'm always gunna say yes. Just the kind of guy I am
It's been that question all 2 weeks
@Wrastling_Ralph if I don't make it to the looney bin though. Have a badass bonfire at the beach and don't spread the ashes till sunset
@Wrastling_Ralph thanks brother <RELIEVED FACE><RAISED FIST>
@Alondra_Moon @JJWatt @JHarden13 @blakegriffin32 I don't mind,  it be cool too. I mean as long as I get so see one of em <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
If I don't make it, I want to be cremated. And just spread my ashes in the ocean
It be cool if I could see @JJWatt at St. Luke's hospital before the surgery <THUMBS UP SIGN> or @JHarden13
Whatever life and God want from me, I'm just giving into it. I'm done fighting. My spark has died, I'm beyond fatigued. I'm dying
I don't know what to think,  I don't know what to feel.
@MalcolmARam26 thanks man, really appreciate it.
But my friends would be hurting,  and I don't want them to hurt. So I'll fight for them. Even if I have to live life exhausted every day
Honestly,  I'm beyond exhausted man. If the Lord takes me back home, I'll probably be more relieved than if I survive this.
My will is, whoever gets there first to my house...can get whatever they want <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And yea, that the point that I'm at right now
DNR = Do Not Resuscitate
I'm honestly considering to filling up the DNR form...
Just been reading on these things all day... 
An artery that isn't working right
Have a 7 cm lesion in my brain still, a dead spot in my left temporal lobe. On 6 medications for life. Gunna have dementia by 55.
@sarcastic_ivan lmfao <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Yet it's still pretty bad
I mean it may not be as bad as some other people's
My reality is hard man
Anything else just brings me back to reality
Laughing and acting stupid is all I have man...really

Like "Party in heaven! BYOB" or "Chillin with Jesus"
If I don't make it, I want one of my friends to keep tweeting for me <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
No "Oops, we fucked up. Too bad, he'll be fine"
It's life or death. No in between
I'm laughing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but man yall don't can't even begin how scared and worried I am for that surgery man

@Wrastling_Ralph @_toriromero kanye west<OK HAND SIGN>
Some of the truest shit I've ever heard <OK HAND SIGN> 
5% and I'm not even stressing
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>  
True 
At 8% but no one to talk to so I'll let it die
It's demoralizing to see
Cause all I see is assholes, scumbags, and trash winning all the time
Is something good going to happen for being good to people? For being nice?
Mom, why did you make me promise you this.
But that promise I gave to my mom...it's keeping me from doing that
I could be such an asshole man. Step over people and not give a rats ass about it...
Might as well put a damn "Welcome" sign on me, cause I'm fucking pathetic like that
I'm too nice to people
I'm gunna get it right sooner or later
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
Kneeling down with some questions to address like
Life on the edge, hell a block away
@sarcastic_ivan <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> lmfao,  what?!
@sarcastic_ivan that's what I just said <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@sarcastic_ivan at the end "Alan what did you score this game at?"
Him: "Ehh"
@sarcastic_ivan yea but you'll be funny, not screaming like a mad man. Just pun after pun after pun. And just show a random picture of Alan
I feel you 
@sarcastic_ivan critique*

No one talk to me...
And who did I hurt? And how badly did I hurt them for me to deserve all this?
Sometimes I ask myself...did I deserve everything that has happened to me?
@sarcastic_ivan lmfao <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> "he always believed that 60% of the time, it works every time"
If Houston doesn't goes as planned, I don't want a eulogy. Just improvise in my funeral, and make it funny please <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Some people should really think about this 
Wishing I had someone to talk to, like have a real conversation.  About life and points of views
That and I need to start sleeping
I gotta start running in the afternoons again, cause these morning runs make me feel so exhausted the rest of the day <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
After the surgery, I'll be happy to make it to at least 45 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Honestly think my mindset is more like ultron's. Relying more on logic and stats, than emotion
I legit lost the ability to "sugar coat" anything, that part of my brain is dead<THUMBS UP SIGN>
Make your mark, be different. Make a legacy 

A new @49ers rookie has EVEN BIGGER hands: 
Ain't sugar costing anything <RELIEVED FACE> but hey, I'm at least being real with you. Other people give you sweet honey lies <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><THUMBS UP SIGN>

This is so true  
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless

Hate not being able to sleep

@MalcolmARam26 
@Jrod10_ @AbGarcia18  it's boxing, not body blows
@Jrod10_ @AbGarcia18 he's being smart, he was on the defensive. He studied pacquiao. It's not just chingasos,  you gotta be smart.
@AbGarcia18 no part 2, he will probably fight someone else. No else will compare to pacquiao.
Real shit  
@AbGarcia18 they didn't agree for a rematch. And mayweather only has 1 more fight in his contract...so
@AbGarcia18 nope, no more rematch.
@AbGarcia18 <SMIRKING FACE> it's all good fam
@AbGarcia18 nawh fam, I'm pretty sure he lost
48-0 <OK HAND SIGN><SMIRKING FACE> @AbGarcia18 who won?
Haha so much hate for mayweather <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Foreal <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> he had around 35% in landed punches overall. Mayweather had more than 50% 
Yall hate on mayweathers fighting style, but he's just smart at fighting

@sarcastic_ivan idk <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> are yall gunna watch it?
Nigga might be cocky and his style might be stupid for some people. It works though and he's the champ 47-0 , 48-0 after tonight
I'm predicting Mayweather will knock out pacquiao at round 8, or really fuck him up that round #round8
@AbGarcia18 whats all that speed and power, if he ain't gunna be hitting shit.
@AbGarcia18 just remember, pacquiao already got knocked out by someone alot slower than mayweather... I'm just sayin, we will see though
@AbGarcia18 but those guys aren't mayweather. You gotta remember mayweather is the best contender pacquiao has ever fought, and vice versa
@AbGarcia18 cause genetics my nigga <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> mayweather always looks like he got his ass beat all the time
@AbGarcia18 nigga already got a fat lip <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> and little ass eyes.
@AbGarcia18 nigga he's black, you won't be able to see the bruises <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but pacquiao is gunna look like shit after.

Leave the toilet seats up and little annoying stuff like that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Like I wouldn't even scare people, I'd just fuck with them like rearranging everything in the rooms

And let me scare some people in the process as well <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
But if you decide to take me back home with you sooner, then grant me the privilege to be the guardian angel of my lil sisters
I don't know what the outcome of all of this is God
I pray I get to see my second lil sis man <RELIEVED FACE>

And even IF that wrong 50% gets to me, fuck it I'll leave this world with a 3/4 average which I mean is still really good <OK HAND SIGN>
That's a great way to put it actually 
And even if open heart surgery is a 50/50 chance, I'm still 3/3. I'll be 4/4 after that surgery <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Why am I happy? Cause I could've been dead three times, and I'm still here tweeting. I'm 3/3 <OK HAND SIGN>
Oh well, even with all these odds against me. I'm still at peace, I'm still happy
So I guess I had the wrong type of luck <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
2 out of 100,000 people have this Wolff Parkinson White syndrome, 1 out of 2 of those people are actually affected by it with arrhythmias <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

Just me and my guitar
<OK HAND SIGN> 
I want him <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
It's all good though <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I'm living happy no matter what the outcome of that surgery will be
So there's a normal heart, and my heart 
I'm good without the heart failure please 
But St. Luke's in Houston has to be the best hospital to do this for a reason right?
Like if they fuck up...I could die <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
It just hit me how serious this surgery is going to be <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>

@AbGarcia18 it's the truth homie <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@AbGarcia18 or Rockets or Golden State take em out along the way.
@AbGarcia18 I'm just saying, either the Clippers make a comeback and win it all
@AbGarcia18 honestly don't think they're gunna get to the championship. They should've retired last year <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@AbGarcia18 if they keep doing work, they should go far at least. I just want to see what Howard, Harden, &amp; Smith against the splash bros <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@AbGarcia18 I pray Golden State v. Rockets <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS> but I'm gunna be humble about my rockets and just see what they do
@AbGarcia18 so did Clippers though. I mean I don't really care who wins <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> but I think there will be a game 7, and it will go to OT
@AbGarcia18 I think it's gunna go to game 7
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
@Lyssagarcia96 there will be a game 7 just watch <OK HAND SIGN>
CP3 is like "don't talk to me nigga, just give me the ball" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Or vice versa,  but there will be a game 7 just watch
Spurs are taking this one, then Clippers,  then game 7 will be in OT with a win from either teams with a 3 from either Manu or CP3 <OK HAND SIGN>
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm dying @JesseTwerks_ @soria_24

I don't like the odds my doctor told has told me about the procedure in houston...

And not cause I stressed so much on something or someone
I hate that calm life though, it's boring. So if I do die,  I hope it's because I was doing something exciting or worth it.
No stressing, no worrying, no bullshit
My doctor told me to live a calm life, cause if I don't the valve in my heart will erupt
Not tolerating any bullshit, not from friends or family alike.
I'm honestly surprised if I make it to 40 <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Not surprised at all

Umm no, I'd rather get a robot heart instead <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Either that or I get a pacemaker at the age of 19... and have to get X amount of surgeries for the rest of my life...<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
So I will have a v2 of a heart... technically making me superior to every person
So they want to burn that part off and put a valve to replace it
So basically what they told me was...a part of my heart is going stupid and isn't wanting to work
Like the stretcher is strapped on to a tube,  but it's not really secured...if that makes sense <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Getting to ride the hospital helicopter is both soothing and uncomfortable at the same time <RELIEVED FACE><FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
God, what are you trying to tell me with all these mishaps that keep coming into my life?
Cause when I woke up, to my left was my doctor and to my right was my father...crying
"I'll be with you through every thing/procedure" i should've known better that girls just lie all the time
I got to ride the ER helicopter...
I hate being at the hospital man
3rd time in a row, guess life doesn't really want me to survive huh
Going back to the hospital
Guess I was dead already, just didn't realize I had gone to hell
Knew it was too good to be true, no one would ever want me. Guess I'm just not destined for happiness
Please god, I don't wanna go to the hospital again
I don't feel good at all man <SKULL>
This is how this headache feels like 
If this is going to be my life forever... then I don't want to be
When will this suffering end man?
I'm not about to go to the hospital again man, too much debt and too much stress for my family. If this is my time, then so be it
I don't want to go to the hospital man
This headache is killing me man
If I end up at the hospital again tonight, I won't be surprised. I feel like shit right now
If I die in their care, they don't care cause they got to study my condition and get more money off of me.
If they really wanted to cure me, they would've done it already
I'm just a hamster to these doctors
Fuck, my right side started to feel numb again
I feel drained and lifeless honestly <ANGUISHED FACE> I don't wanna be like this the rest of my life man


I feel more and more tired every day man
It's an everyday thing now  
19 and $84K in debt
I'd rather get surprised and find someone is an actual person, than expect too much from someone and get let down
Always expect the worse from people, cause that's what they usually give you
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><THUMBS UP SIGN> 
I'm losing too much weight <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Yea I'm a psycho, so what?
I'll think myself into a bad mood, but that same creativity snatches me out of it
And has my creativity on overdrive all the time
But this type of thinking keeps me entertained at least
I'm a really weird thinker
I just realized that if an EMP sets out close to me, I'm fucked <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> #weirdthinking
I need to get out of here
Real talk  
I hate seeing hospitals man

Right side of my face was numb for a while...
That's just great <ANGUISHED FACE>
Kept getting woken up by the damn chip last night. I got shocked around 8 times <CONFUSED FACE> so at 8 points last night, my heart was quitting on me <ANGUISHED FACE>
I need to sleep
@Wrastling_Ralph yes lmfao, it's good
This is city God told me, go and make it at
I got a date with destiny, I'm running late for that
A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be kings
@TheGuyAlex96 thanks man

#StephCurry ft. Devvon Terrell 


The thought of you is driving me insane
come on baby lets go listen to the night train
Got a moon and a billion stars
sound of steel and old box cars
Like wtf $80k? They better plate my heart with gold with that fucking money
Mom, maybe I'll be reunited with you sooner than expected
I'm pathetic, I know.
I'm always an option, never a priority.
So Houston and the procedures will be around $80k... I'd rather die
Honestly if God takes me back soon, I'd be okay with it. I'm hurting so much man
I'm suffering so much man, you don't understand...
Thanks dad, just add more weight on my shoulder if you want
Cause I can't handle being hurt no more
So please don't be a lie this time.
Hey passy, you're a jasse @JesseTwerks_
"I'll be with you through it all", I've heard that way too many times. And they've all been lies
If I end up in a casket next, I'm glad I left some good memories to some friends
I'm a piece of shit person man, a low life. Yet my mom would always see me as the best, as an angel
I should've been there for you mom...I hope you can forgive me
I feel like such a bother sometimes
@nochill_brandon never know homie, I've been lucky twice. Maybe death will be lucky the 3rd time
It's crazy how you can be there on day, then in an instant you're gone.
Funeral...
@Wrastling_Ralph @Partyprobs but instead you'll get the McJackyDs or the McCrown <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><OK HAND SIGN>
@KingAdamSosa you live and you learn homie
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @Wrastling_Ralph bro this is you for sure  
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> can't breathe 
I'm not alright in the head man, but I'm at least true about it. Some people try to deceive others, telling us that they're golden
@AdamThe_G Happy Birthday homie! <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN><WRAPPED PRESENT><BIRTHDAY CAKE><PARTY POPPER><CONFETTI BALL><BALLOON> have a good one
That's what my mom would've wanted
I want to be rich and successful, but only as a cushion for life. I'm still gunna be humble and be a simple man
@sarcastic_ivan @JesseTwerks_  
Dancing with my lil sister cause I need to cheer up
<THUMBS UP SIGN> 
Ironing my slacks and a nice button up
I prefer the ugly truth than a beautiful lie
Be real with me
I'd give everything, all the riches in the world, just for one hour more with my mom
Cause some of us would do anything to give them at least one last hug
Man, your mother is a big blessing. So please don't enjoy them and hold them tightly next time yall see them.
3 hours in 3 days, that's pretty evenly distributed right? An hour for each day? <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Got 3 good hours of sleep in me.


@sarcastic_ivan I'm just tired man,  I'm to the point of exhaustion.
So again, if you wanna be with me then cool, I am well worth the hassle. If you don't then please don't fuck with me, cause I'm still hurtin
I'm not going to compete for someone. I don't have that kind of strength right now, cause this was a huge scar.
I should've not even slept man
Just be straight up with me
I deserve to be happy man
@JesseTwerks_ come to kv
Please don't get my hopes up
20 mcdoubles cause my friends are fatasses
So if anyone ever tells me "trust me", it's nothing personal, but I just know better now
Cause everyone else has proved me right, that trusting only gets you hurt
And a lil handful of people in my life
Only person I ever trust is my brother @Wrastling_Ralph
Trusting people,  nah man that shit doesn't fly around with me.
I'm aight
@ChocoThunder35 @OnlyFuturistic @iamKingLos <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> right?
King Los and Futuristic together?! I'm there <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> no hesitation
Nigga! We gotta go @ChocoThunder35  <FIRE> 
<FIRE><FIRE><FIRE><FIRE> 
Now to switch it up to @teambackpack cyphers
I hope u notice me
I know we'll grow to be...
Somethin 

<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️<FISTED HAND SIGN><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
It's been a Cudi kind of morning/day 
The way I'm feeling, I might sleep tonight
Like every day you have to find frantically for something that will get you through the day.
I'm really glad no one here is going through, what I'm going through. It's exhausting man
May 18th, it's gunna make me or break me man
@MalcolmARam26 nigga I'm broke as a joke with a debt to the hospital. And God knows how expensive these procedures will be in Houston
Man, I just realized...this year has been so crappy to me.
@MalcolmARam26 man, I don't know what could make this year make up for all the bs that's being happening to me man
@MalcolmARam26 nigga I got another stroke after spring break!!!! <ANGRY FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
@MalcolmARam26 my year better drastically start going up, or I'm gunna kill someone
@MalcolmARam26 fuck you nigga
I'd be down for this one day 
I love running. It's just you and your thoughts the whole time
Stick with me, I'm well worth the investment
I be that
@ChocoThunder35 bro, I love the rockets and James harden is a beast...but Curry is just not human
@Wrastling_Ralph I'm gunna make it exactly like that man
@Wrastling_Ralph ahhh I can't wait!
@Wrastling_Ralph they are mickeys though <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Wrastling_Ralph true, so I'll just put these bad boys 
Fuuuuck why can't 4 years pass by faster <RELIEVED FACE>
@Wrastling_Ralph idk, these are pretty bad <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
And for those rainy days <RELIEVED FACE> when the sls and the jaguar are in the garage @Wrastling_Ralph <OK HAND SIGN> 
I'm in love <HEART WITH ARROW><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@Wrastling_Ralph it's nice right? I think I am going for the sls too. 4 years brother <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@Wrastling_Ralph 
In 4 years though, I'll just be worrying about which car looks better with my Rolex. The R8 or the SLS?
Right now I'm worrying about hospital bills and getting good grades
Yall niggas look alike,  sound the same, I swear to God I hate your face
Man why can't 4 years go by quickly so I can be rich already
Tf? Now it wants to rain?
I feel bleh
Ain't feeling too good man
#virgo kinda true  
Got too fat over the month and a half of hospitalization
Then start going up again, just pure muscle though
Gunna go down to 185 of muscle again
Has lost 30 lbs since the last time I was at the hospital <RELIEVED FACE>
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

It's all good though cause I'm still winning <SMIRKING FACE><OK HAND SIGN>
"@Jay_Andrew88: Hate hypocrites"
Aight I'm done
IF I even have to get kids <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> cause I mean who the fuck would want me. I'm all fucked up. Just dead weight to be honest
But fuck it, my success will be short lived. I'll keep all my fortune to my offspring
Like who the fuck would want to be with a man who will lose his shit, literally,  at the age of 55?
Ain't even looking for my future man, cause at 55 I'll start developing dementia
I would never wish this on anyone in this earth. No matter how bad of a person you are.
It's stressing me out. It's eating me alive man, but for my friends...I keep a fake smile and try to keep strong
The first thing you feel in the morning is a shock, then feeling like crap the rest of the day. Man I hate this shit man.
Like do you know how hard it is waking up, your heart beating irregularly, the chip in my heart shocking my heart to calm it down?
@Jrod10_ we will bro
Honestly man, I'm fucking tired. I'm done
"@Jrod10_: It's so damn difficult to sleep when you got so much stress." I feel you
I'm not tolerating bullshit from anyone so yea, done
<UNAMUSED FACE> really?
Guy or girl,  if you cheat in a relationship... you're a piece of shit in my book <OK HAND SIGN>
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW> seems pretty straight forward 
May 18th...
I wish I would've treated you better <PENSIVE FACE> I was a horrible excuse of a son momma, I'm sorry
@ChocoThunder35 @MarioPalush @JesseTwerks_ like, I'm overwhelmed by the beauty of this...
"@MarioPalush: A peeled watermelon... now you have seen everything 
@JesseTwerks_ I'll get you the fear 4s if you get me these
