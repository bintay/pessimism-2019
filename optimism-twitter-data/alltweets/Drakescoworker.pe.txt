@wonderjuan just got here waiting @ snowden be back to dorm soon!
I'm hungry and it's making me miss eating my Bfs housemates food at 3 am
#collegein5words why am I here again
Traveling alone on a Wednesday afternoon has me looking forward to my later years in life with lots of money and probably a dull career
I meant that the airports do not allow that.....however I wish they would
Darn u airport for permitting me to sneak my bf into my checked in luggage to come home with me
"@EhJovan: @Drakescoworker i hope you get gas witch" I'm only bitter bc I have 5 breakouts from all of the pizza Rotem forced me to eat
@EhJovan I hope it comes back
Living with my Bf for a week is like 
@extremepup Go 2 sleep my sweet lover
Sex is fun especially when there's a bag of chips to eat afterwards
Bf and I are just trying to cook and eat but instead wasted two whole things of pasta in the process. Third time's the charm....,...
@extremepup Bad things u mean

@Lacedinpiss I'm not doing anything special! U are just as awesome
Misinformed and delusional can move on. If you care more about trying to prove women wrong than helping them then you are the problem.
To put women down for just trying to live and spread awareness. The men that keep replying to my posts about this trying to tell me that I'm
It doesn't matter if FeministsAreUgly was made by a woman or a feminist that wanted to post a selfie with it when this tag is now being used
That last retweet and all of his replies to other women calling them whores and fat and stupid literally proves my entire point
#FeministsAreUgly was made by men who refuse to accept the crazy idea that women don't deserve to be killed and raped just for being a woman
#FeministsAreUgly was made by the same men who frighten &amp; catcall women when they're walking alone then call them a bitch for walking away
Loads of love to my now 21 year old significant other!!!!! @extremepup Finally I can say tomorrow I will get to be by your side<DOG FACE><CAT FACE>

@japanstu We can sell them to ppl outside of Applebee's and threaten to make their half priced apps full price if they don't
“@japanstu: @Drakescoworker Monique if anyone should write a book it's U I would buy a hundred” Honestly how amazing of you..,.
change as time goes by and I put more logic to what I know. Anyway what a time to be alive and well in my mind
my own thoughts and fascinations. Still not into the idea of others hearing or learning those things about me but I expect that will also
Used to not see the appeal of writing and publishing your own book but that has unexpectedly changed since I have become more confident in

Anyway where's @Drake at I'm ready to publish a book
saying what we really want and believe we know. Learning to build confidence in your thoughts and ideas and theories really go a long way
worth saying. Chances are it probably is and the ability to relate to others would be much more achievable if we weren't so scared of
more easily understood form. I think my most communicable thoughts are the ones I don't spend long and hard on deciding if it's even
I know what I know even when I don't know that I know it already. My greatest challenge is translating sudden intuition into a rational and
Lately I am in deeper touch with myself than ever and this learning process has only made me love myself more!
Hit me up if you want dorm room decorating tips and tricks! Also if you're really broke and desperate probably 
@japanstu so at least it doesn't taste like regret and actually tastes like it was worth it
@japanstu Treat yo self...also it is good to have a cheat day at least once a week. This is your splurge and that is so okay!!!! enjoy it

Also very alarming (lol) that one of my roommates did not leave their bed while the fire alarms were going off. The fire that cried wolf!

“@pup2006: when ur gf fake angry at u and she's so cute when she's mad but U gotta act serious 
Also sending thoughtful loving letters to distant family increases your chances of being included in their will.....and also their heart..
Sending letters to family is fun and not as time consuming as you think so pick up a piece of paper and write!! It goes a long way
