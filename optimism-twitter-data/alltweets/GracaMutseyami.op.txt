pack mentality is rife at university, it's really sad, I can't tell the difference between any of the yats on the vale
shouldn't even be angry, our democracy is a sham, it failed us and manipulated us into thinking we had choice and that we could make change
never been so optimistic and hopeful in my entire life and this goes to show I'm never thinking like that again, sad day for govt
kept having dreams of upheaval and rioting throughout all the major cities, I threw a bottle at a doctor, my subconscious is a ruff rider

@eyeswidethot if you take the exams and get the same average that's a pass?
@eyeswidethot that's why your location is manchester, sounds a dream, wish the best with that x
@eyeswidethot were you planning on telling anyone ahaha?
@eyeswidethot fair enough! literally what everyone is saying, it feels like such a waste, I want to drop out every time I attend a lecture
@eyeswidethot have a wild guess, where have you been? haven't seen you in months??
PHD students are such jobsworths, absolute wankers, you're not even a real professor!!

Went to pet my neighbours dog and it  lipsed me. I now know how drake felt being kissed by madonna
@johnprescott is savage, I want him on my team
@vickygrout all her self help tweets, she needs to take some of that advice about humility and art like gtf-outtaa 'ere
@vickygrout enit if I see another screenshot of her camera roll full of selfies... I swear <HOCHO>
@vickygrout her persona is jarring, this whole quirky cute sneakerhead yet she is probably mean af and honestly it's another fruitloom brand
so glad @vickygrout called emily oberg and her thirst trapping brand, savage but rate that tbh
@MansaCam #sus
@MansaCam I've got all three images, that's on your end
@MansaCam there is no such thing? it's a great comparison, twigs is an incredible woman who challenges gender and art, just like frida
Had to use a library computer today and they didn't have google chrome installed. Imagine my nausea using internet explorer man
In a BBC doc a man actually said 'you can't wash white clothes with colours, it's not right' in regards to interracial couples...like fam

@erniieeM @jamesblake yh and also to have people acknowledge his pals on the tour too, who are worthy of that recognition - to him anyway
@erniieeM @jamesblake ...being apart of it has overshadowed everything else but him, making it sound like one time joint tour/gig-type night
@erniieeM @jamesblake he did state as much upon announcing it tbf, the announcement of frank...

@erniieeM @jamesblake we?! I'm taking full credit for this one, I am an indigo child!
@erniieeM personally I love his MySpace singles more than both his albums but overgrown is pure art <OK HAND SIGN>
@erniieeM completely the other way, overgrown was his golden ticket to recognition, clean/cut and had features which helped him break the us
When your friend is deep into their overdraft and they bring up that £5 you owe them from the pub in semester 1 
@erniieeM understated? you've been sleeping under a rock, he's the Frank O of electronic music...His release 200 Press was slept on last yr

Got my hair in a blow out, low cut top showing my ample bosoms and I can't stop yelling word for word jolene, I am Dolly Parton
Royal Mail jacket really? people will do anything to push that edgy look, literally and sarcastically 
@itsfisayo nah as much as his relevance annoys me, I wouldn't think he would be that dumb to rival every output between artist and fan
@itsfisayo no you won't, buy the album on itunes or CD, give your money to where it should be going in music not these fast money schemes
@itsfisayo kanye is a partner/shareholder in tidal ahahahha guess again
@itsfisayo the idea is stolen! what do you think spotify, soundcloud, youtube, google play have been doing, it's jay z is just so hungry
@itsfisayo about cool, gtf-outttaaaaaa here, it's a farce

Finally starting to regain some consciousness, felt like Courtney Love circa 1990 since wednesday
Feels so good to be home and not questioning whether one of my flatmates is dead due to the rotten corpse smell in our hallway/kitchen
gems that come on shuffle you completely forgot about &gt; 
@MansaCam what article?
People laugh at history of art but try learning every disciple in humanities through one subject, honestly try and do my degree, I dare you
I've still got butterflies from @ScubaOfficial's set last night
@sophiebremner_ why bother now aye, especially on the penultimate day of the semester, I'm doing the work that's all that matters
@sophiebremner_ cute of you to assume I'm going ahaha and her name is Kristine not Carly? Goes to show how many seminars I've attended
@sophiebremner_ it's a really pseudo piece of art, have with what?
@bigbiglovefig2  incredible... 
@mariannekatiex @MedievaIProbs @meg_nash THAT WAS ONE TIME!!!
@meg_nash literally us, 
@bigbiglovefig2 I saw this at the pompidou, sat there and watched it 5 times over, that guys inspiration inspires me
Wish I could wear this everyday, everywhere 
@_pr4ise do it!!!!
@_pr4ise levels, madting
listening to @palmstrax, @jonrust and jamie XX all afternoon, made me realise how vibes last night was, just insane, well done @LeftfootUK
Everytime I look at @FKAtwigs I see Frida Khalo, anyone else see that/get that vibe?
Was shouting obscenities at Jamie XX, along the lines of 'you're the Michelangelo of music' I swear if you're reading this I'm sorry Jamie
@SMooron FAM! that's not a holiday!
@SMooron where to? sheffield?
Today is the day ppl
Was really rooting for myself to make every seminar and lecture this week, I really was
I haven't been to my module Ideas of the Renaissance in about 6 weeks and tbh I don't plan on starting now
@meg_nash probably drunk as per
@meg_nash yes I have!!! do you not remember I was creasing on the floor and you wouldn't let me try them on, in your room
@meg_nash realest fucking tweet meg, always have to resist the urge to cuss you out cause your my pal
@Venusalikhani nah don't talk to me about FTPT, I'll get vexed this isn't the time nor place rn
@Venusalikhani as in the people who I speak to are either voting green or not voting at all - thus far anyway
@Venusalikhani they are massively, once you get to uni you'll meet more green voters than your fingers can count, the rest are apathetic
@Venusalikhani ahaha struggle man, Westminster woes right thur
@Venusalikhani it's for aesthetic, Britain will forever make its heritage/history/ancestry at the heart of everything it possibly can enit
@Venusalikhani I know man it's sad and you put it so nicely aha 'extremely rich citizens' ahaha
@Venusalikhani ahaha you will, they're not all monsters it's just how the world of politicians works
@Venusalikhani definitely does! and that's because our constitution is uncodified therefore a divide in power doesn't happen unlike the U.S
@Venusalikhani and Gordon brown is heavily steering the fate of the Labour Party towards the run of the general election, politicians are <SNAKE><SNAKE>
@Venusalikhani yeah exactly and the president of the United States isn't the highest form of power in the U.S. now is it?
@Venusalikhani so if the screenwriters play it out right I'm sure it can last for 5 seasons max
@Venusalikhani ...read some half arse article in the library about it, was bare bored so don't quote me aha
@Venusalikhani it really isn't, most presidents and prime ministers are far more influential once they aren't in office surprisingly
@Venusalikhani yeah she really fucked it up, letting the guy kill himself - it's a downward spiral from there onwards sadly
@Venusalikhani where about are you? She does many things to fuck it up, are you at the part where she's in Russia?
@meg_nash creasing!!
@Venusalikhani ahaha her sass adds to character but it's all talk, wait and see and her french was <OK HAND SIGN>
@Venusalikhani don't get gassed, I was like you once, she's a joke once realising, the woman's got body and in those designer suits <FIRE>
@PaddyColl_Yeah that's bare sad man, I'll buy you a coffee this week as form of encouragement
@PaddyColl_Yeah nah never use wiki that's for amateurs that, see you in like wednesday's seminar I'm gonna sleep for two days after this
@PaddyColl_Yeah performativity and Chris Ofili... your words mean so much rn, I'm gonna get done for plagiarism but at least I've done it
@PaddyColl_Yeah I'm still at 2000... euthanise me pls
Of course my sister chimed in with her tennis ball looking head just so she can seem like the golden child as per #pagan
My mother and aunts discussing what form of contraception is best for me 'cause I'm having copious amounts of sex right ahah all da time aha
Decided to wear a shift dress to family lunch and the amount of shade thrown at me as 'I look like I'm hiding a pregnancy' which led to...
@MansaCam bring me in...
@MansaCam especially when they can write like scholars but speak like they've never had a day of education in their life.. I swear
@MansaCam but they come from road or look like they belong on road and their getting themselves an education, that's so sexy!!
@MansaCam @yhbran nah but everyone loves an educated roadman, that shit is so attractive

Reading the opening line to my essay and thinking... 
@MansaCam so confused, feel like I missed something important like a hidden meaning
@SMooron shutdown eh? eh?
@mariannekatiex I wish! that's my dream man to be a buddha in bali, none of this uni business
I understand cultural appropriation is a ting, but why forever be on white people, just enjoy yourself man
I don't understand some black people on tumblr, always bitter about white people screaming 'they always steal our shit'...

@_AlexHirst knew you'd favour hansel's look
“@SamKellogs: *reads four-pins once* @Four_Pins 
@IzzieEveritt1 even my mum was insane (but I'm bias to the masculine look) why do parents never keep their clothing!
my dad is my biggest fashion inspo, if I was ever a designer.. 
He's just playing hopscotch with the platform and his luggage... Imbeciles
Like really...
His way out, I quietly whispered 'seriously let the child get off' and those stupid woman goes.. 'I didn't know he was getting off'
People are absolute monsters during peak hour, getting on whilst a man with two children, a buggy and heaps of luggage is struggling...
@CamiPoccard yh it's our course thing isn't it? my friends will be there but I'll make my travels with the l'historie de l'art crewdem
@CamiPoccard same I'm going home tomorrow to smash it out and coming back in time for tektu, where did you hear about Hot Since 82??
@CamiPoccard I've seen hot since 82, he'll be good and I wanna go but hannah wants will be so jarring, with ppl who only like rhymes <UNAMUSED FACE>
@CamiPoccard mateeeeeeeeeee dont fuk me off thought you're going get together?
@bigbiglovefig2 literally <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

Cause sexual harassment only happens to women right, 
@meg_nash aha shut up I'm always nice man
@meg_nash can you tell by my texting I'm still licked #nosleep
I wanna be on your team magic door x give me all your beans and glitter
Can we please talk about how incredible sick fucking amazing magic door was tonight, like please my feet r bleeding and I've just got home
Never been so envious of someone's sex life but the sounds coming from that room... Not so enjoyable to hear pal
Girl in the flat above me is constantly having what sounds like the best sex every night and now it's become every morning too...
Especially when helmets started flying off - PROTECT YOUR CRANIUMS BOYS!
Witnessed the most dirty ice hockey fight ever, player number 4 for hull university needs to be kept on a leash #welldoneuob

Just watched fifty shades of grey and it's honestly the wankest piece of cinema I've ever watched
Cannot believe @thenbhd collaborated with French Montana, didn't see that coming, jesse looks hot as per but I don't like the rnb vibe
@bigbiglovefig2 jamie XX in birmingham, he is my love, my national treasure, I'd sod questionable things to see him, of course I'm there
@bigbiglovefig2 yeah?
Always that one token black guy who's friends buzz of the fact he can jerk to almost every song and he has no shame doing it either
Every time before a night out the group chat gets so stressful, there is a surge in the no. of texts with tops and lipsticks flying about
@Venusalikhani ahaha hardly analysis but thanks I guess
@Venusalikhani yeah I think it's because it's a hype song, you need the visuals and overall riotous atmosphere of the crowd, still 10/10 tho
@Venusalikhani don't stress me out, you like the studio version better?
I've listened to studio version of all day about 60 times on repeat and the live versions is 10x better
@PaddyColl_Yeah ahaha it is that time of the term where I contemplate dropping out everytime, I feel ya
@PaddyColl_Yeah roughly I think
@PaddyColl_Yeah aha enit, that would stress me out but not much else you can do, don't have a spare laptop to hand so sorry
@PaddyColl_Yeah gonna have to make camp in the library, music library computer is always free next to our arts one
@PaddyColl_Yeah don't scare me like that! and peak, claim it on insurance?
@PaddyColl_Yeah what do you mean all your essays?! When is debates and methods due??
“@JeromeLOL: Tequila Mockingbird” @FeyysaraMartins your type of literature
Overthinking is a killer, not feeling this week already
I feel so claustrophobic and tied down
@CamiPoccard spent the equivalent of what I would have spent at cirque du soul (including ticket) so might as well have gone cirque
@CamiPoccard jellll all that money I spent last night might as well have gone
@CamiPoccard never before, it was such a rarity but good night nonetheless, was cirque du soul good?
@CamiPoccard GC after we danger fab-ed
only highlight was the first dj playing know yourself, 10 bands and blessings, so sick of bobby shurmada, enough please
Like I don't want to listen to DJ Charlie's soundcloud mix nor do I want to suck my mum, like what kind of DJ uses that as their adlib???
The DJ was the epitome of trash last night, not everyday promote your mixtape and rewind the song back 7 fucking times
@TheaTheClam aha well you just get me thea
Deadlifts this morning absolutely ruined me, quaking like I just got a colonic
Just cooked the best steak of my life with homemade sweet potatoe fries, feel like I'm getting to grips with this domesticated lifestyle
@itsfisayo oh you're one of those people aha, tbh it will mess up when we're both watching it at the same time
@itsfisayo and nah you can watch it stream websites like watch series
@itsfisayo aha peak times, I'll give you mine when I get back in later b
@itsfisayo so happy! when I come back from the gym, I'm going to be bed ridden
*heart palpations* genuinely worried I'm not going to see civilisation for a while and me and my bed will be one 
@hrachik_m he make you conflicted, I have my moments of doubt but it eventually all makes sense, took me 5 months to understand yezzus
Fast forward everyone on twitter once this dress stupidity is over... 
Wasn't even that emotional, the man just has my heart right now
Watching the zane lowe interview and I cried when kanye cried, I'm a mess. Haven't cried since mr brown(twat) threatened my alevel results
@mariannekatiex's snapchat story has me in bits, absolutely creasing!!
I want to stay in bed and listen to the stone roses, wallowing in my sadness but I've chosen to write my essay on this seminar.. da struggle
people are bare cussing out madonna, what she do to you but give you bangers such as vogue and like a prayer, like can she live please

I haven't got a tv to watch the #brits and I'm missing skepta and kanye, like I dreamt of this collab for far too long, screwing man
My mother is my favourite person but she knows what buttons to push to get me from 0-100 in terms of anger levels
@Four_Pins @_AlexHirst didn't spend £500 on margiela for your 'I like your crew neck, it's a nice fit' half arse comment smh

I understand the work load differs but is putting down another degree going to lighten that? no so stfu and stop comparing, comparison kills
#rantover now I'll get back to being a sheep and doing my reading for this seminar <RAM>
like people at russell group universities are so bloody jarring, like everything is owed to them
like get off your high horse we all had to get the same grades or above to get here, infact my course grades are higher than that of nursing
from our generation, so just shut up you obnoxious and then having the nerve to call those degrees 'not proper degrees'
to make yourself 'stand out' from the rest of us sheep, therefore gaining more debt, especially with the record amount of ppl going to uni
like stfu you prick, we're all jobless, like you're not going to be working in bhs 6 months post-grad or investing in higher education...
When people makes jokes about doing humanities and art degrees and their being no jobs and they're doing law, medicine or nursing...
@TheaTheClam the only way to do a hangover correctly plus a good sausage sarnie and glass of oj<OK HAND SIGN>

And I'm not trying to brag but homelessness is a real problem and I cry when my mum buys the wrong type of gü pudding
I went back as my train was delayed, having felt like a dick and gave him my coke and two quid and no I hadn't drunk it, not that skanky
He said 'don't worry about it, have a good evening' and I replied 'you too' ... Who the fuck says you too to a homeless man?!
A homeless man outside Luton station asked me for change which I said no sorry having bought a Big Mac for a homeless man in McDonald's..

@Venusalikhani see I just need someone to explain this to me, so I understand! but not a fan man even though their pretty hot, would not cop
@Venusalikhani but I do like the bomber jackets/parkas and shoes ngl
@Venusalikhani I'm bare fussy in that I'd say it's shoes and outerwear but what trouser v? pls what trousers? 
@Venusalikhani you make a fair point, maybe it's 'cause I really didn't like the womenswear, idk I need sit down and think about it over tea
and now wolves being produced by @CASHMERECAT and @sinjin_hawke (??) so confused but then again he's always ten steps ahead of humanity
I'm very confused about Kanye's direction right now, first his presentation rather than a runway with tumblr babes and instagram 'gods'
@Twiggy_Official allow the cat meme's, you're asking to get blocked, infesting my mentions with such vermin
@Twiggy_Official yes but when is it ever a good idea to consume less than your body desires? never, that's when

I live for Sunday's at the soak 
The confidence people have to point at themselves when the dj says 'who fucking tonight' looool yeah, your left hand pal
@beccadawes very very weird
@beccadawes that's so true but then it's losing its integrity, this article sums up how I feel 
@beccadawes it's not about what they look like more who's nipples they are, it's sad that fashion houses are more focused on celebrities now
@beccadawes it's trashion, so disappointed
Uni is kind of bless enit

@Twiggy_Official aha you were the only one who I could exploit due to bad work ethic, so you were very much appreciated, nothing but love
@Twiggy_Official nah they were rubbish, lets be honest now
@Twiggy_Official constantly giving me wrong answers to copy and you're suggested essay plans never got me above a C, disappointing twiggy
@Twiggy_Official knowing you, you'd try and set me up purely for embarrassment, our relationship in history made me untrustworthy of you

@MansaCam exactly! whilst really trying to force their style as the most innovative look in fashion when the next john doe wore it for SS13
@MansaCam who doesn't hate them but their own kind it's everyone who stands outside for fashion week waiting to be street styled by pause
@MansaCam but no-one can be gosling but gosling, so let them imitate and dream its harmless and god knows abercrombie needs customers aha
@MansaCam can you blame them? gosling makes girls wetter than a rainy autumn day, so if the notebook hunk is wearing it they would be too

@SMooron bullshit
@itsfisayo check your phone
@itsfisayo you back now?
Cannot stand conversations with people which aren't stimulating, like how can we talk about trainers and 'funny tweets' for three hours
@MansaCam true but it will all be worth it when she's old enough to straighten her hair and it's naturally long and full
@MansaCam haha you're really mad, black hair as a child needs to grow naturally blowdrys etc are all so damaging you'd be shocked
@MansaCam what do you expect them to do give a toddler a weave or use harmful chemicals to straighten her hair? She's just a child
@MansaCam thank you!
@AFMatapss you have no idea how long I've been waiting to leave, definitely and yeah I am, meet you there?
@AFMatapss yeah got into uni of birmingham and your tweets all year have been about reading, who cares if they flopped be happy!
@AFMatapss really well I was actually shocked aha, did you get into reading?
@hrachikelberry good on you for challenging it though
@hrachikelberry ..discussing the topic without having judgment passed on them for their opinions regardless of their standpoint
@hrachikelberry it's not ok and it won't be until there is no longer a taboo around the subject and people of all races feel comfortable...
@hrachikelberry and from first hand experience its better to ignore such vulgarity than rise up to it and challenge their ignorance
@hrachikelberry it's not illegal to be racist so they.re entitled to their opinions
@hrachikelberry its just social media, some of them are trolls but honestly similar comments are made closer to home hrachik
@hrachikelberry they already have too much, their uniform allows them to commit heinous crimes ordinary citizens get criminal records for
@hrachikelberry he hasn't deleted the post so he must be serious and someone comment 'please don't breed' aha
39 shags? From his right hand I assume... 
@Wandee16 everyone keeps telling to me go but it just seems a bit crippling going through similar education process over and over again
@nadinerefaat YEAH OMG! completely forgot to text you its been so overwhelming
"If you choose to stay with Birmingham you better get used to being the majority instead of the minority" o m g my sister is rude
That feeling of being labelled an underachiever and a failure all year then going on to prove teachers wrong feels so nice <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Beyond shocked
@Charlottay95 it's the daily star... think of their target audience
@SMooron true but there is bound to be some leeway from majority of universities (I hope)
@hrachikelberry ahaha I beg you don't die, our hearts beat as one rn, you work really hard hrachik, you'll get through this
@hrachikelberry aha were in this together honey, I'm feeling your stress
@LottieBeatrice he has the authority to still do that, you never know
@LottieBeatrice aha that's the kindest thing I've heard anyone say about him
@Wandee16 your priorities were straight, clearing is going to be my best friend
@LottieBeatrice that's all I keep hearing/reading in the news and ofqual made sure the marking be harder this year 'apparently'
@Wandee16 I really hope so because I haven't got the self esteem or confidence to become a stripper
"a-level results are on the verge of collapse" "one of the worst in years" "particularly volatile" 
It's so funny watching white ppl squirm in public whenever the n-word is in a song but you know they scream it with conviction on their own
@meganxrosa that's true or have an issue about always being in the right or in the wrong
Some people really think it's not possible to ever change your mind about an opinion/view like it's not a human thing to do
No matter how many times I've already been to the dental hygienist I'll never be familiar with the pain, so unbearable

<BOMB><COLLISION SYMBOL><YELLOW HEART><YELLOW HEART><YELLOW HEART> 
Ed Macfarlane's dancing trumps any moves I've ever seen before, what I would give to see it live again
@hrachikelberry aha thanks just makes me so annoyed 'cause it means ppl compromise when they could do so much better if they made the effort
Just be patient, no-one is going to tell you all their interests and life experiences in an hour let alone 10 minutes
No-one just wants to get to know someone for the sake of it anymore like, people are going to start marrying themselves if it becomes a law
happy birthday @ErinMcNamaraa, gutted I couldn't make tonight but have an amazing 18th, love you and see you soon<COCKTAIL GLASS><COCKTAIL GLASS><HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@KashOladiran didn't catch young fathers but agree with the machinedrums review for sure
@KashOladiran but it's just his opinion and sometimes he's on the money like with the review of nikki nack, he gave credit where it was due
@KashOladiran exactly my point, his ratings are so off especially with the new RiFF RAFF it got a 6 and ultraviolence got a 2 like what the?
@KashOladiran noted, he was just chatting absolute bs on the new ab-soul, I never finish watching his reviews anymore
Srsly have a hate-hate relationship w/ @theneedledrop he just trashes some of my favourite albums, feel like his talking ill of my children

It takes so much to embarrass yourself like this, @LaurenGoodger is actually the joke of all reality stars 
It's amazing how many people are about when the sun is shining, especially during the weekdays, it seems no-one has a job to go to
@Charlottay95 aha same! I'm just in it for their gorgeous faces and tight bums
@Charlottay95 I really really want them to win, forget brazil (even tho they will win)
Germany are a bunch of right lookers, really want them in the final, gehen Deutschland!
Angela Merkel looks so cute in her little coral number singing the national anthem
@KashOladiran you tell me 
@KashOladiran even you know he's a fine Italian stallion, stop frontin' kash
@KashOladiran it's the world cup though and with men like pirlo and sturridge running around sweating who wouldn't watch?
Have a serious weakness for Gary Linker tonight, has he always been such a silver fox? or maybe HD just does him wonders...

@Sleeaazy aha alright I'll have a listen to it, did he have any promo behind it? because I heard nothing in the sphere about it

That look you give to the stranger who refuses to drop eye contact 
@Charlottay95 still yet to watch it, is it truly worth my time?
Instead of attending predominately black churches trying to prove they're not racist (Donald Sterling) as a form of apology
In terms of damage control I think a few celebrities can adopt the sincere method of apology like Jonah Hill, 
Kendall and Kylie are now 'authors/writers'... really though? really?
'I truly love hedgehogs, baby hedgehogs they give me life 
@Charlie__Parr fair enough, definitely applies to the colonies, never doing that boring course again, rather eat monkey shit
Feel confident but I know some chief examiner is gonna screw me and call me out on the bullshit stats about West Germany's ample workforce
Love how everyone is clearing out their history notes. I'm clutching onto mine knowing if I have to repeat the year it'll be down to history
As if RZA is realising his album and only making one copy and somebody has already bid 7 million, that's so ridiculous, that's bloody insane
@TheaTheClam @MirandaHowe she's not my teacher anymore, so let her quote me but I can imagine mrs hall saying it aha
@TheaTheClam @MirandaHowe aha no she'd just cry and report me to senior management saying it was directed at her
@Venusalikhani I'm in complete agreement, just really hope I don't see the day they come into government
@Venusalikhani that's what so problematic about it all, they're all daft as each other tbh
@Venusalikhani you're right but all parties were shifting to the centre anyhow before UKIP came along to offer a strong right wing stance
@Venusalikhani I'd rather vote for the torries or labour if consequently it meant UKIP would not be successful, I'd rather have then govern
@Venusalikhani agree voting apathy is a big problem especially with our generation but...
If you truly care about politics visit party websites and educate yourself on which parties offer what and remember to vote
A lot of two cents flying around from twitter politicians who think their ignorant opinions are going to impact the support of UKIP
All these ratty year eleven's always arguing on twitter, take it to lyddekker or the nicky line init
On repeat until I relax about this graphics exam I'm very ill-prepared for 
@jessnieberg that's so bizarre...

Kid Cudi could wear a crop top, children's dress, spanks, moon suit and I'd still want him to be the father of my children any day
Too late... clearly the internet is something I do not fear
It's a shame when someones tweets have been solid 10's all day but one more favourite from me would give off creepy/stalker vibes
@naomihodson only thing my mind's going to remember for the exam is the soy sausage now, thanks naomi wish I never read this<DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>

Cannot get over people shuffling to taio cruz last night loooool
@FisayoLonge @Wandee16 he's a prick
@hrachikelberry rather the opposite, his grasping the opportunity to be 'intense' on issues which are of concern but his approach is so off
@hrachikelberry  Farage won't get the opportunity to screw us over but he's a great speaker unlike Clegg, hence why he is so appealing

@pharaoht_ religion needs to be taught its such a radical aspect of our society that being ignorant about is worse than being knowledgeable
Everyone thinks they have taste and style, when very few do
JME // serious just came on in the taxi and I just lost all decorum, grime will never die for me
The way Americans say shallots as 'charlottes' makes my ears bleed
@jessnieberg so jealous, they are tears in my eyes
@RunwayRibbons you're right, seeing Emily Blunt and Mindy Kaling's names on the front make me think that they would have made better covers
Kim is untalented but she is pretty to look at. The cover is horrible and I don't like how desperate her and Kanye have been about it
Lol kanye really made that vogue cover happen
I'm the biggest investigator that I even get creeped out by the depths I reach sometimes
