I was so busy this morning I didn't even get to enjoy my morning <TOILET> :-/
@samthefatbear :(
My thoughts are racing. Night.
@_catmand00d * about
There were a few time where I paid, walked in, and then walked out and left because I was too terrified.
For a while, I was so scared to go to shows because I felt like I could literally hear what people were thinking out me.
@_catmand00d idk. I'm just diagnosing myself, lol.
@_catmand00d I feel like that's where my sequence of crying 3 nights a week began.
cyber bullying is real, don't ignore it
@_catmand00d if I was hurt so bad by something so stupid, can you imagine how people feel when they're threatened or told worse things?
@_catmand00d that's sort of where I kind of gave up. I realized no matter where I went, people still found ways to break me.
@_catmand00d like that wasn't really that bad, but it really fucked me up. I didn't go out for months.
@_catmand00d they uploaded my profile picture from FB at the time and were like "Let's play the 'is it a guy or a girl' game xD"
In 2012, someone created a "956 trash" sort of thing on tumblr and posted about me in there. It was the ugliest feeling.
I'm so nervous about this evening holy cow
@jesflowerss that dessert looks so good I'm sinning just by looking at it
@samthefatbear neta id hug you rn
It's Election Day. I have to wake up at 5am and go all over Edinburg to ensure everything flows smoothly. I'm so nervous.

@sadgirlgang yeah that's what I mean by they can't. it's shitty. there's so many factors haha
I hated fallback records but it was a venue so whatever haha it served its purpose
@sadgirlgang and cause well they can't haha. but a lot of times people don't go because they feel "eh..I'm too good for that" it's so stupid
@sadgirlgang you're one of the few, honestly, shit ain't the same. mainly cause a lot of the younger crowd doesn't make it out anymore.
Main reason why I don't go often is because I have a shitty work schedule.
The egos here are way too fucking big.
wanting to throw an all local show is cool and all but with how everybody is down here nobody will fucking go lol
@tanalenae your game? what game? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@sirjoshofmosh @LouisFromTexas yeah or else you can't register or even take the course
@LouisFromTexas than Chem
@LouisFromTexas well, that's how gen bio 2 is. Part 1 is more experimental. Both of them basically involve memorizing though. WAY easier
I'm actually pretty glad I'm done with Gen Bio 1 and 2. I'm finally starting the classes associated with my major!
there's only one lecture available for the course I'm taking next semester lol
@LouisFromTexas @sirjoshofmosh that's super weird. I don't know why it's doing that. I registered Sunday night and I didn't have a problem.
@LouisFromTexas @sirjoshofmosh Are you taking gen bio 1?
UTRGV made no sense of itself lol. UTPA just got redesigned like a year or two ago haha. no pos wow.

I still can't believe Mr. Cavasos passed away...

Oh shit I didn't realize the time. Bye Twitter, lol.
I have 2 episodes left. I decided I'm just going to finish One Tree Hill today.
@tanalenae STOP
@leahnicolee7 @Stinkysteve00 all of you are so fucking adorable I seriously can't <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
@gyzzygeee okay awesome, teen dramas are my favorite haha. I'm finishing one tree hill and need something else to watch! Thanks <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@tanalenae this is true. the ceiling of her car is only 2 inches from the top of my head when I drive it.
@gyzzygeee Okay! It's like dramatic and crazy?! cause that's legit all I watch haha
@gyzzygeee is the entire series on there???
Is "Skins" honestly a good show on Netflix?
I'm going to drive around Taco Bell a few minutes before midnight to see what the traffic's like lmao
OKAY DAN IS A BADASS WOAH
Watch the movie Crash. Just do it. It's on Netflix.
The weather feels awesome right now and I'm a bit baffled?
@_saml0pez you finished it?! lol dang you must've REALLY binged <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

If there are any vigils or anything of that nature at Med High in memory of Mr. Cavasos, please let me know. I'd like to attend.
Mr. Cavasos was such a great teacher, friend, and mentor. My condolences to his wife and family.
Mr. Cazasos was helped me transition into Med High and guided me through so much. Rest in peace. You will definitely be missed.

staying the fuck away from my timeline today lol at least I won't forget what the damn date is
@_catmand00d ANY SUGGESTIONS GUYS???
I'm so torn between lab that starts at 7:50am including lecture getting out at 1:20pm. Or lecture and lab from 10:40am - 4:10pm.

mind you lecture and lab are equally 3 hour long periods each
So the only day vertebrate anatomy has lecture is on a Friday. VA lab is also on Fridays only. Meaning I have VA all day long. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
I really hope the discussion was just a participation grade. I'm terrified.
I want to go to sleep but like registration at midnight
@Mawissakee SAME omg
@Mawissakee I reaaaally would like an A but I just don't know if it's possible
Any other biology majors taking "Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy" in the spring?
Pooping gives me too much time to think.
If I get a B in CIS I'm definitely taking that bullshit again I NEED an A
@Mawissakee I have to meet with my professor because that's literally the only class I want to get a B in :-/
@Mawissakee CIS is computer bullshit which shouldn't be hard but it is because I don't give a shit about it (aka I don't study) <PENSIVE FACE>
And then all of a sudden, a wave of negativity does the same thing and I'm like "I'll never go to medical school. I'm so shitty." lolol
Idk what it is, but like a wave of confidence will splash over me and I'm just like "I'm so gonna ace my finals!"
@Mawissakee I'm so terrified for my Chem lecture because it's cumulative and I don't know shit <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>

@loudxclear dude yes! voting should definitely, always be a big deal. I'm so excited to vote for president.
I'm not making a decision as to who I'm supporting yet. Just know it WILL NOT be Ted fucking Cruz.
A lot of people voted for President Obama only because he's African-American. We're in the U.S., remember? Lol
Hilary's got balls, though. I'm just not sure if she knows how to use them correctly, yet. She can handle it if necessary.
@loudxclear a lot of people will vote for her mainly to keep republicans out of office lol

I just wish my knee was better. I can't wait til it completely tears so I can get another operation and fix this bullshit.
So now that someone hit my knee and it hurt, I'm definitely going to be staying far from the pit which fucking sucks.
it hurt so fucking bad oh my god
someone hit my knee super hard at the show last night and I was just standing there lol
I already really miss @Stinkysteve00
People pick up and instrument, group together friends that support them, and the rest is history
Yeah, some locals piss me off but I'm pretty sure that happens everywhere lol.
That's why I've gone to shows on Sunday's and was able to go to corpus yesterday.
I'll be honest, if I had the time, I'd attend all the past local shows I've missed. It's just that I work/close weekends.
@tanalenae hold up girl I'll be right there
My birthday's tomorrow!
I'm not hitting up another festival until hopefully Austin City Limits in October smh
Now every time I see Gideon, I'm going to compare to how well they did in Corpus because they already wiped out NSN's performance
The intensity last night was fucking awesome. Corpus does not hold back
@GideonAL did amazing, man. Unforgettable.
I tried recoding badass stuff but it's dim as shit and nothing comes out :-/
Fuck, dude. MDK's vocalist is here lmao.
Next is The Acacia Strain and fuck im gonna hang against the wall lol corpus DOES NOT hold back!!!
MY VOICE IS GONE
THE CROWD WAS LIVE AF WOW I AM AMAZED
GIDEON WAS EASILY 80X BETTER HERE THAN AT NSN

I barely finished my essay at around 3 lol bye
I took a badass 30 min shower rn.
I'm so tired of writing this essay, dude. And I still have a whole other essay to write.
Now back to writing.
Stay on the lookout out there. DPS, Edinburg PD, and UTPA PD is lurking bad tonight.
Bothered
If I have a gut feeling that my essay is going to be okay, I should follow it, right?
Like dude, a lot can happen in a week :-/
He was like "I'll have you all turn in these essays a week before the exam so I can know whether you're going to fail or not"
it's just that my professor really pressure us about these essays and I'm nervous <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
so I ended up napping for an hour lol
but that's fine, I'm able to pay for rent and have some spending money
I'm gonna take a 30 minute nap and then get started on completing my 1st essay. It's pretty difficult..
being cashier / delivery person / person who handles the phone / and busser all at the same time is difficult lol
that was the longest 5 hours of my life. the phone like never stopped ringing dude

Alright. Time for bed.
No hangs tomorrow night <PENSIVE FACE>
I need to knock out most of 2 essays tomorrow and MAYBE the rest of the 2nd essay on friday.
I'm way too sleepy. I'm just going to have to go into lock down tomorrow to stay on schedule. <PENSIVE FACE>
Woah! McAllen applied to possibly host one of the presidential or vice-presidential debates in 2016! Super cool!

“@ErikBathory: “@Kimbruhhh: This girl needs to go home.” She needs a home*” Kezia, go home.
Depression isn't a fucking joke.
If I ever decide to get my ass up, Tana will be the reason why. She's truly an inspiration and one of my best friends.
@funkdiplomat @bloomingjudy we're taking over Colima tomorrow. be. ready.
Minimum wage is shitty. But remember: servers are only paid $2.50 plus tips. You know how many shitty people don't tip? $2.50 is not enough.
what I would do for a grilled cheese sandwich rn


@LouisFromTexas thanks
@LouisFromTexas if you don't mind
@LouisFromTexas Like do you have notes? My professor is shitty at explaining things
@LouisFromTexas have you covered Hess's Law in Chemistry?
the elevator slammed in front of my face I hate school
@princesspillow_ that's like so close, yet so far away /-:
@princesspillow_ dude :-/ 
Kezia is far from an asshole. He is a sweetheart and caring and nope, not an asshole. Never never never. Not an asshole. Nope nope nope.
@ErikBathory you're not an asshole at all whatsoever
you're one of the biggest assholes I know
dude I still don't get how people like you
I'm done with the LAC
This bullshit happened last time
I'm at the LAC in hopes of gaining assistance with Hess's Law but there's like 2 tutors here and they both cover biology and physics
I'm really glad I deleted Yik yak cause now I can eat my food in peace
I could literally hear him talking lol 
@bloomingjudy @lafemmenikita13 im sorry <LOUDLY CRYING FACE> thanks!
@bloomingjudy @lafemmenikita13 you guys don't understand how shitty I am at this lol April fools help me
@bloomingjudy @lafemmenikita13 I suck tho :( is this an April fool's joke? lol
I'm struggling so hard to stay awake
CIS is so boring man I'm being tortured
Thinking of saving my appetite and grabbing chik fil after advisement

april fool im always in a bad mood
still grossest me the fuck out that parents will deliberately shun their children for following their hearts
@aSpoonfulOfJose I'll delete this now...<PENSIVE FACE>
Remember when I gave @ben_hinojosa spaghetti, Flash underwear, and a clever penis-shaped lollipop for Christmas
I also want to eat all the pasta in the world for my birthday
pasta is definitely my shit
I mean, to the VERY few people I text lol.
I'm not a good person to text, lol. 80% of the time I forget to reply.
Getting the chance to see Gideon again at an out of town show is the best birthday gift ever man
IM SEEING GIDEON IN 5 DAYS
that means...
Hey cool, my birthday is in exactly one week
I was sleeping in a damn sauna last night!
my brother is always cold and I hate it
@skatanica dude they're really cheap on Amazon <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
How fucking evil can you be?

Gets out. Leaves the car on. And runs back into the house.
She had a chance to RUN THE BITCH OVER but you know what she does!
this episode is legit pissing me the fuck off
EVERYONE ON ONE TREE HILL FIGHTS LIKE A PUSSY AND I HATE IT
Tip your deliver person, too
@PincheEddy I read this the way the chick says it on the songs lol
That's super interesting honestly.
@miltonsolano11 that's really interesting. So it basically depends on the person.
@miltonsolano11 yeah that actually makes sense
@miltonsolano11 like move onto other types of drugs? Like they get bored?
Kind of like, when overweight people just decide "I'm done. Time to lose this weight"
No judgement here. I'm just really curious.
Like do some stoners just wake up one day and say "fuck, man. this shit is boring. I think I'm done"
I have an honest, totally curious question:
Do people ever get tired of smoking marijuana? Like does the high ever just get old?
@tanalenae more broccoli? :&lt;
@tanalenae dude :(
@tanalenae like if it fucks me up, what if you're like sensitive now :o
@tanalenae dude maybe it's the pill
@tanalenae is your tummy bothering you? /:
@Prevailed_ I just hate chem so much :( lol
Should I take Chem 1302 in the fall? Or start on Physics 1????
@aSpoonfulOfJose they're like seasonal allergies like to pollen, humidity, etc. Do you feel something tickling your throat?
@aSpoonfulOfJose it's supposed to rain in the next few days so that's probably why
@aSpoonfulOfJose allergies, change in weather
Just make good choices in the long run!
If a girl likes sex, let her have sex!
If a guy likes sex, let him have sex!
Sex is sex, your choice is your choice!
Don't be ashamed of your sexuality!!!!
