Another awesome haul from the Crossroads Market book sale in Calgary. Now to do the bookshelf… 
I've got 2/10 mos planned for Rwanda (at least for one grade level). Eagerly looking forward to knowing if I'm teaching another grade level.

@colleenjdavies @Currlab Thank you! Hopefully you find something that inspires you for your PS3 PIP! :)
Today I presented on Intentional Community Building in the @Currlab. For all interested, my website link is here: 
@MissDCollier Thank you! :)
Last teaching day - can't believe I'll be done my degree by the end of the day! 
A little BMO perler bead creation from one of my students!

The fact that those close to me react to my victimization in such a blase fashion is a testament to how little we (care to) understand it.
New unfortunate connection to cyberbullying: I was harassed by an unknown number last night. Friends said get over it. This is a real issue!
R.I.P. #radioshack 
A5 #teacherwellness I've said no to commitments b/c how can I be my best self for my Ss if I'm overtired? I can't commit to them so I say no
@AtlTeacher Haha we do, but I just have Netflix. No satellite for me!
A3 #teacherwellness Watching TV is a tough one. It's relaxing, but I could be planning! Before I got into TV, I would plan to 11PM at night!
@ms_wirzba just learned about a neat tracking app on the #teacherwellness chat called @BrightLoop. Thought you might be interested!
A2: #teacherwellness My desk! I clean it every day but stuff just piles up all day! Being an intern, I can't create a whole filing system.
A1 For me, I'd like to simplify my planning while also engaging Ss. It's quite timely to come up with engaging things! #teacherwellness
Looking forward to joining in on my first #teacherwellness chat soon!
@GregKostiuk @LethCamp @ms_wirzba our pleasure! Thanks for your a support!
Lethcamp was such a journey in planning and turned out to be a wonderful success. Grateful to all involved and participating. #lethcamp

Found in the Indigo store in Saskatoon. Love it. #knowledge #education 
@KirbyFecho @ms_wirzba Great! Your resources have helped a bunch!
New old tech: kinesthetic, engaging and gets over tech difficulties for Ss who don't know how to collaborate. #edtech 
Great article with some new uses of @Pinterest I hadn't thought of before! #edtech 
So, last week halfway through my job interview I was offered the teaching position in Rwanda! Thanks to all who've made me successful!
Though creativity is a process, it uses discipline specific knowledge to create a product - how you get there is up to you! #westcast2015
Do we as educators mistakenly take creativity out of the context of course content? Inspire ingenuity everywhere! #westcast2015
To promote understanding of language construction in not one, but two languages, use Dual Language Books! #westcast2015
@missmichtich either way lots of fun! I really loved my time at SWATCA! Have fun!
@missmichtich thanks! Are you at SWATCA?
@missmichtich It's been great! Did a presentation today and taking things in tomorrow!
No great Parent-Teacher attitude is formed without putting yourself in their shoes. #westcast2015
Parent-Teacher Relations: address "bubble Ss" who don't make it to interviews, but need support more than a gushing parent. #westcast2015
Low teacher efficacy = difficult parent-teacher relationships. #westcast2015

@VinceRuhu Thank you very much!
Finally, I get to be part of another organizing committee meeting for #lethcamp. So very excited! This will be a great week!
Today I attended some PD on Classroom Management; next week I'm attending PD on Assessment. Fully immersed in education! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Also: I just applied for a teaching job in Kigali, Rwanda. Interview in about two weeks. Fingers crossed!
So this week I'm co-presenting at an Ed conference. Never thought I'd be in such a great position. Excited. Nervous. Eager to be helpful.

@lindseybaird Thank you! I've actually got them saved on my pinterest!
I’m not even apologetic about spamming everyone’s twitter feeds with this hashtag. Fundraising to a good cause! #BellLetsTalk
I encourage any and all resources related to developing, maintaining and nurturing mental wellness in classes. #BellLetsTalk
My hope is that by fostering this open dialogue in younger grades, I can build a better support structure in students’ future. #BellLetsTalk
The primary focus of my educational research has been in fostering a classroom community that is supportive. Very exciting. #BellLetsTalk
I am still always asking, “How can I do more to be supportive to those who need it?” Today, and any day, I invite responses. #BellLetsTalk
I now use it in all situations. It’s helpful to know how to be a good active listener. I can support in times of good + bad. #BellLetsTalk
This Christmas break I took a course on Mental Health First Aid. It really helped me learn how to support others. #BellLetsTalk
I can only imagine what others experience. Mental illness is so deeply personal. We all have our own demons.Real perspective. #BellLetsTalk
The more I believed I was making it up, the more I beat myself up for being so self-destructive. It spiralled. #BellLetsTalk
I know that part of the reason that I never talked was because I didn’t think anyone noticed. I thought I was making it up. #BellLetsTalk
The most frightening thing about mental illness is it’s invisible to so many on the outside, but inescapable on the inside. #BellLetsTalk
The toughest thing for me was taking my youngest sister to the hospital this Christmas because she was suicidal. Surreal. #BellLetsTalk
Thankfully, I have the support of a close circle of friends to help. But not everyone knows (or is) so lucky. How can we help? #BellLetsTalk
This has been noticeably with me for the last 8 years. But dealing with it is tough. And scary. I’m still not great at it. #BellLetsTalk
I suffer from deeply entrenched depression. Most days it’s manageable, but there are periods where it’s unbearable. #BellLetsTalk
Even though our society is getting better, and there’s a wealth of support the actual ability to open up is crippling to many. #BellLetsTalk
I have seen so many close friends and family, as well as students young and old struggle with mental issues. #BellLetsTalk
I know personally I struggle with talking about my own issues. Let’s use #BellLetsTalk to open up the conversation. We all need this.
#BellLetsTalk day is today so I’ve scheduled a bunch of tweets ahead of time. Mental Health talk is SO IMPORTANT.
Please tweet out #BellLetsTalk to show your support for a developing and robust conversation about mental wellness and support.

It was a real treat to watch @ms_wirzba in action today! So fun! 
All set up for a classroom chemistry experiment this morning! 
@MissAlyssaChuk Love studyjams!
@MrBertamini @cybraryman1 Thank you kindly!
One place where I've been weak lately as far as collaboration goes is joining Twitter chats. Does anyone have a Twitter chat schedule?
I can grow as a learner, teacher, &amp; professional. I can nurture growth in my colleagues + in my Ss. There's nowhere to look but up.
It's all about growth: plants inspire my teaching philosophy. You see it as decorative elements in all I do. But sends an important message.
In terms of professional responsibilities, my favorite is sharing my ideas + planning w/ other Ts. Collaborative teaching is SO rewarding.
ALSO: @ms_wirzba + I are presenting at 2 upcoming conferences - WestCAST in #Saskatoon &amp; UofC's Education Symposium. SO PUMPED. #abed
SO MANY EXCITING ED THINGS: Yesterday, took part in first planning committee meeting for #lethcamp. Thanks for all who are joining our team!
Really dorky but I'm getting ridiculously excited for a measurement unit I'm planning for March. REALLY. EXCITED.

On the lookout for any Gr. 5 Classroom Chemistry websites to use in regular exploratory activities. Suggestions? Google results are spotty.
Fantastic first day at @OLAlethbridge! Lots of learning and plenty of new smiling faces!
I woke up to "Concerning Hobbits" this morning so of course everything will go well on my first day. #uleth #ulps3
@msbrandford Thank you! :)
In about 9 hours, I'll be starting PS3! Very excited and a bit (read: lot) nervous! #uleth #ulps3
Excited to introduce the site documenting my Inquiry Project during PSIII: 
Unreal that my internship starts in just three days. Incredibly nervous!
I just updated my Weebly website. 
Planning a grade 5 math unit on Multiplication, and I'm feeling uninspired. Anyone have any resources to pump some life into this unit?
I'm doing a Grade 5 Newspaper unit. Not sure how to have students write their articles. Stupid question: Do Grade 5s Google?
@msbrandford unfortunately it's the last one offered at the uni, but you can go to the MHFA website to find other workshops!
Completed day 1 of 2 of Mental Health First Aid. Giving some incredible insights into how to be truly helpful in others' difficult times.
Very excited to announce I just wrote y last exam ever for university! Now, on to PS3, and then graduation (on my birthday, no less)! #uleth
Are we teaching Ss to take control of learning, or let someone else steer them through? Great article for thought! 
Free open-source font to help #dyslexic readers?! Yes yes yes! 
@technolandy Good to hear! I know in my neck of the woods anxiety is at it's highest reported levels. Always looking for new things to try!
@technolandy Just read your article on anxiety and it really captured my frustration as a S + gave insight for my teaching career. Thx!
Today I met my PS3 Gr. 5s, my mentor + my principal. Thank you for making me feel so welcome @GregKostiuk + @OLAlethbridge! I'm excited!

@jheiding The LRPS tweeted out last night saying it was a business ... but wouldn't say which or why.
Lots of exciting things coming my way education/PD wise! Really excited to be working on several projects!
@Jarred_Braun Thanks! :)
Question: How do you archive twitter chats/hashtags? Is there a website/app for that? #edtech

“@MissDBabey: @MeaganFL 
He was eating crunchy green leaves. All of a sudden he saw a large bird flying overhead.” #ulethed4702
Once upon a time there was a lonely caterpillar hanging out on tree. #ulethed4702
Gonna be doing some fun twitter activities for a class presentation on twitter! Wooo! Seeing some in-class applications!
It is easy to feel "inundated" by all there is on twitter - know how to manage it! The cream of the crop rises to the top! #ulethed4702
#ulethed4702 I like using twitter as a Professional Development tool! Also great for gathering lesson plans/resources from other teachers!

@KirbyFecho Thanks, I'll get back to you :)

I have five teapots somehow. Hobby or obsession? #notahoarder

@Currlab Thanks! I'll be stopping by in the near future to pick up some book examples!
@Currlab Doing a project on Bibliotherapy and it's use as an intervention strategy in my Behaviour Disorders course. Any good resources?

Apologies to the guy who thanked me in the PD session today! I was caught off-guard that people knew me. I'm sorry I didn't get your name!

Key learning: A tough day means you'll start over again tomorrow, not burn a bridge between you and a child. Success is individual. (2/2)

@shayne_mr I've got one planned tom. TH373 on Experiential Learning.
@KatelyndMarchan Own the experience.
@missmosborne I thought my time was better spent working w/ Ss or visiting other classes - ask your TA what he/she recommends. #ulps1
Okay, this concludes the end of formal questions for the #ulps1 twitter chat. Opening up to other questions from current PS1 students!
To those of you signing off for the night, thank you so much for participating! Thank you for sharing and connecting! Good night! #ulps1
#ulps1
@TrishHaugrud I don't think I've tried that one - I'll have to look it up!
@TrishHaugrud I think I ended up buying that book off the district - I used it so much in both schools!
Very true! RT @Mr_Maek: @MeaganFL @tuckchris also important to get to know and respect the classroom culture the teacher has established?
I agree w/@tuckchris. Taking feedback positively shows great respect, and willingness to improve! #ulps1
@shayne_mr Ha! That's one way to do it!
A5: I really enjoyed having discussions about teaching practice, current trends, and things we were both wanting to know more about. #ulps1
A5: Get to know them beyond their role as professionals! What's their life outside of school like? #ulps1
Last question! We'll do an open question period for about 20 min. after this last one! #ulps1
Q5: How do you establish a good relationship with your mentor teacher? #ulps1
@shayne_mr For me, it's easier to teach in the atmosphere you most enjoy. I love middle school!
@shayne_mr You should be acting and abiding by them, yes. including them in lesson plans - no.
A4: Some days your PoS will feel like a P.O.S. Don't be afraid to ask for help translating it into realistic learning activities! #ulps1
A4: ASK YOUR PLN! Sometimes, I was totally stumped, and a fellow student-teacher, or twitter, saved me! #ulps1
@msbrandford YES! I only write a few things down now!
A4: Weekly meetings w/my TA about the direction the week should take were so helpful! Don't underestimate the value of communication! #ulps1
A4: I could best think about what needed to happen the next day if I outlined things after school. Then, relax before going back. #ulps1
A4: Use your prep time at school! Good for gathering resources, if anything else! #ulps1
@CoryHoffner Thanks for joining! The archive link will be posted tomorrow if you want to check what you've missed!
Q4: How did you manage the time needed for planning lessons? #ulps1
@TrishHaugrud So true!
A3: Be true + consistent to your values as well as the expectations you have of Ss + yourself. Share self expectations w/ Ss as well! #ulps1
A3: Let them see you're human - on my first day in PS2, I told S I was nervous, but excited to be there! Be relatable! #ulps1
@AGraceMartin Yes! These are  things that let students know you are the teacher in charge!
Q3: Be confident. You're in control at the front of the class, so demonstrate that in stature + voice. You ARE supposed to be there! #ulps1
Q3: How did you establish credibility as a practicum teacher? #ulps1
@TrishHaugrud Yeah, I was at Riverside Elementary (gr 4) in PS1, and St. Mary's Middle School in PS2!
@MsMelissaGough Welcome!
@KatelyndMarchan Welcome!
A2: I did a few team-building exercises throughout my PS1 (it was a "Tribes" school). Dedicated time to this is so important! #ulps1
@shayne_mr Been taking those chances throughout PS1 and PS2 :)
@missmosborne Depends on the teacher. I had three days to "work my way in" before I taught.
#ulps1
A2: Also, it is well worth your time to ask students about themselves 1-on-1. Very helpful, and very enjoyable to build rapport! #ulps1
CANNOT overstate this! Always say yes! RT @TrishHaugrud: A2:if an opportunity presents itself, take it. Get involved #ulps1
A2: Ask your principal/TA if there is an upcoming musical you can help with, or  a sports team! Clubs are a good way, too! #ulps1
New question everybody!
Q2: What is the best way to become involved in the classroom? #ulps1
A1: An enriching experience is one where you're as involved with the school as you can be. Stay within your limits, though. #ulps1
@shayne_mr Trust me, it does! I was twitter-challenged at the start of my PS1 last year!
A1: You are coming from a faculty w/ new teaching practice - this you can show your TA! #ulps1
@shayne_mr If you're feeling overwhelmed, the first time I joined I was an observer - remember it'll be archived so you can see it later!
A1: Recall you are part of a TEAM. W/ your TA, your UC, other student teachers, and other school staff! #ulps1
@ADavies7 Welcome!
A1: w/@missZielthedeal: try anything + everything while you have the support + feedback to work on it! #ulps1 Ss are forgiving of new stuff!
My PS1 taught me that the student’s needs come before the lesson’s requirements. #ulps1
Q1: What is the best piece of advice you could share from your own practicum experience? #ulps1
@AGraceMartin We'll open it up to questions later, but for now I have a few we can all discuss together!
@MattFosen @AGraceMartin Definitely dependent on the school, but you can count on login problems with every computer related lesson!
Very exciting to see all who have joined the #ulps1 chat! Talk, just take it all in, or ask questions. My first Q for all is coming up!
After 8PM, I will open up for about 20 min. to those still available as open ended Qs from current #ulps1 students - ask away!
Some guidelines: I will number questions Q1, Q2 for past PS1 to answer. Answer in A1, A2 format. Current #ulps1 Ss: ask questions, interact!
Finally, an archived copy of this conversation will be posted on the EUS website after this evening, should you miss anything. #ulps1

Great site for helping teach historical thinking. 
@hewsonk27 Awesome! You'll be hearing from me soon. :)
Very excited to become a part of Read On volunteer team at Lethbridge Public Library helping adult ELL’s! Training tonight!
@hewsonk27 would an #edteach chat for new PS1's on "what to expect" be something to do? I know some Ed2500 got it, but not all.
@hewsonk27 The same to you, too, Kurtis! :) Thanks for sharing!
@hewsonk27 Taking my last five classes at the university, 3 of which are Ed-related. Next semester is PS3!
@hewsonk27 Thanks, Kurtis - you too! I’m glad you mentioned this - I think I’m going to make it my motto. Thanks for the reminder!
In between holidays and program planning, I'm interested: What is one key learning/resource/etc. you took from this summer? #abed #edteach
@IanCooke6 Enjoy it! Good luck :)
Any and all resources + connections you can think of that are relevant to #natureeducation -- please send my way! Thanks in advance!

@kylemedu I'm back in Lethbridge every weekend! A tea day sounds fantastic :)
“Just teach.” Great life advice from an eight grader. 
Teaching my first full day tomorrow! Bring it on! #uled #edteach #ps2
@kylemedu This is a strange class. She said she'd never seen anything like it. They don't say a word!
My TA and I are trying to "crack" a grade 9 class that won't talk. Pick-sticks are one way, but are there others? Help! #edteach #abed
@MrDanLafferty So far so good! I hope yours are fantastic as well! :)
@WannerZee Thanks!
My TA has already asked me to develop my unit for the whole English teaching staff at my school. Feeling proud! #mhcbe #uled #abed #edteach
@MrDanLafferty “Yours” by Mary Robison? It’s sad, but sweet. I still remember it from my grade 10 year.
@DrJayDrNo I learned it through Dr. Bright in the Ed Faculty - it's all hers! All the same, I hope you enjoy the process!
@DrJayDrNo Happy to discuss! Recently did it as a class activity similar to lit. circles. Proved to be rewarding in that context.
@DrJayDrNo Ultimately, their inability to balance leads to these “nuanced” discussions &amp; sound bites. Also issues of public appeal. Tricky.
@DrJayDrNo In so reading and talking about these texts, we hope to make smart thinkers and smart readers. Canada Reads struggles to do both.
@DrJayDrNo (2/2) will make connections with the text, preview + research it, pause to question and think as they read, etc.?
@DrJayDrNo I think this ties in with whether or not a person has the characteristics of a “smart reader”. Are they the kind of person (1/2)
@DrJayDrNo Exactly. If we are truly to be smart consumers of literature, Canada Reads should be a jumping off point only.
Teacher’s in their free time be like: “hey, check out this teacher’s manual &amp; that textbook I’m not actually teaching!” #lifeintherealworld
@DrJayDrNo Bit of both? Rich discussions can bring out important issues. But having 1 book represent those issues is problematic.
Student Textbook: 400 pgs. Teacher’s Manual: 650 pgs. #teacherlife #realworld

@MsLutzmann I tried to DM you but it looks like you have to follow me, too.
Thanks for the chat #plpnetwork!
@bluebirdcat That sounds absolutely fantastic! Creating something new together!
@bluebirdcat Agreed! Wherever it will meet the most people!
@BeccaAdkins3 Perhaps starting small, something like inviting a few out for coffee and seeing if it grows from there?
A12 #plpnetwork I would like to see a T that asks and encourages ways to build my interests into school or community functions.
A12 #plpnetwork Staff email in the morning with a joke - quick and easy, but the thought is there!
A12 #plpnetwork Regular staff outings may not be a bad idea! Go out for appy’s or a glass of wine, perhaps a round of golf or bowling!
A12 regular check ins w/Ts. Builds community, and is a good model for Ss. #plpnetwork
A9 absolutely important to model! Ss see we’re human, and can share similar stories with us or the rest of the class! #plpnetwork
#plpnetwork
A8 I’ve found it doesn’t need to be a grand gesture. Bits of humor as I walk down hall or rows, in between bits of learning. #plpnetwork
A5 #plpnetwork I am grateful and thankful for my career as a T, and that is joy enough. Sharing that w/Ss makes it magical.
A5 I take moments to step back and admire the process. Even a few seconds here and there to appreciate the moment. #plpnetwork
@snbeach Yes!
A4 #plpnetwork Ss willing to take risks in learning, build relationships w/ others, have positive presence in class and around school.
A3 #plpnetwork In some unfortunate cases, the only place Ss May experience joy is in school. Send Ss away better than they were in the AM.
A2 #plpnetwork From a pragmatic perspective, if students are laughing about it! they’ll be remembering it later too!
#inspiredlrn Thank you! Glad to join!

Q5 Conflict management. Recess supervision today definitely taught me that. Not entirely related, but wooow. #uled
@millerg6 Thanks for the follow, and for all you've shared this evening!
@Mr_GingaNinja This is so fantastic and uplifting to read. Something the student can keep forever! Love it!
@hewsonk27 My TA found it on pinterest!
A4 I'm with @MrDanLafferty on this: just your presence is usually enough for most small things. Ignoring negative behavior also key. #uled
@hewsonk27 @AndyTyslau My TA lets Ss get tech cravings out by allowing them to play subject-relevant games once they've finished. #uled
@hewsonk27 Ss put name &amp; time. A bottle of hand sanitized goes on their desk. No one else leaves the room till the first S is back. #uled
A3 Daily exit slip: filling out a sticky note as a "tweet" on the class "twitter feed" - one thing they learned that day! #uled
A3 Agenda routine at beginning &amp; end of day. Sign out sheet for the bathroom. Wash desks before lunch! #uled
@ADCrabbe Hilarious!
A2 An important thing when introducing signals used while you teach - practice! I spent a solid 5 min doing this &amp; it helped a lot! #uled
A2 Echo/Chorus: T-"Class Class!". Ss-"Yes Yes!". Love it! I've also found that Quiet Coyote (both hands) is awesome! #uled
@hewsonk27 It is insanely appreciated - still makes MGMT an important focus for STs, but not so terrifying that we flounder! #uled
A1 I think an important thing to add is that my TA was very clear that I receive the same respect Ss give her. #uled
@Darci_Collier Such an important thing to keep in mind - quickly jumped on the habit of having my kids stop and drop! #uled
A1 Establish expectations! This has made teaching a breeze (ish) so far this week! #uled

@Mr_GingaNinja Good point. Make a reminder at the top of the sheet to point out what that check mark signifies. #edteach
A6. Seeing a lot of checklist recommendations on here but what exactly is on those checklists? What criteria are being checked off? #edteach
@MeaganFL Is there a way to get students involved in ongoing informal assessment during class as well? #edteach
Q6: How and when can you immediately track formative assessment during the lesson (particularly if you’re forgetful)? #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton Good point, Kurtis. I had my blinders on there - just mentioned purpose a few tweets ago! #edteach
@jaymelinton The thing I worry about is that Ss will dislike T marking down Ss talk - will this make them nervous? #edteach
Q5. Loving all the tech resources for tracking! What about paper/in-class tracking? As Ss answer Qs in class how do you track that? #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton I would love to check it out!
@WannerZee Thanks for the follow!
@jaymelinton Is this a free software? #edteach
@WannerZee Gets Ss much more involved in their own learning; takes a little pressure off Ts to track it! #edteach

@ms_wirzba just learned about a neat tracking app on the #teacherwellness chat called @BrightLoop. Thought you might be interested!
A2: #teacherwellness My desk! I clean it every day but stuff just piles up all day! Being an intern, I can't create a whole filing system.

Found in the Indigo store in Saskatoon. Love it. #knowledge #education 
@KirbyFecho @ms_wirzba Great! Your resources have helped a bunch!
New old tech: kinesthetic, engaging and gets over tech difficulties for Ss who don't know how to collaborate. #edtech 
Great article with some new uses of @Pinterest I hadn't thought of before! #edtech 
So, last week halfway through my job interview I was offered the teaching position in Rwanda! Thanks to all who've made me successful!
Though creativity is a process, it uses discipline specific knowledge to create a product - how you get there is up to you! #westcast2015
Do we as educators mistakenly take creativity out of the context of course content? Inspire ingenuity everywhere! #westcast2015
To promote understanding of language construction in not one, but two languages, use Dual Language Books! #westcast2015
@missmichtich either way lots of fun! I really loved my time at SWATCA! Have fun!
@missmichtich thanks! Are you at SWATCA?
@missmichtich It's been great! Did a presentation today and taking things in tomorrow!
No great Parent-Teacher attitude is formed without putting yourself in their shoes. #westcast2015
Parent-Teacher Relations: address "bubble Ss" who don't make it to interviews, but need support more than a gushing parent. #westcast2015
Low teacher efficacy = difficult parent-teacher relationships. #westcast2015

Just a few of the strategies @ms_wirzba and I shared at our presentation this afternoon. :) #community #joy #edchat 
@VinceRuhu Thank you very much!
Finally, I get to be part of another organizing committee meeting for #lethcamp. So very excited! This will be a great week!
Today I attended some PD on Classroom Management; next week I'm attending PD on Assessment. Fully immersed in education! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>
Also: I just applied for a teaching job in Kigali, Rwanda. Interview in about two weeks. Fingers crossed!
So this week I'm co-presenting at an Ed conference. Never thought I'd be in such a great position. Excited. Nervous. Eager to be helpful.

@lindseybaird Thank you! I've actually got them saved on my pinterest!
I’m not even apologetic about spamming everyone’s twitter feeds with this hashtag. Fundraising to a good cause! #BellLetsTalk
I encourage any and all resources related to developing, maintaining and nurturing mental wellness in classes. #BellLetsTalk
My hope is that by fostering this open dialogue in younger grades, I can build a better support structure in students’ future. #BellLetsTalk
The primary focus of my educational research has been in fostering a classroom community that is supportive. Very exciting. #BellLetsTalk
I am still always asking, “How can I do more to be supportive to those who need it?” Today, and any day, I invite responses. #BellLetsTalk
I now use it in all situations. It’s helpful to know how to be a good active listener. I can support in times of good + bad. #BellLetsTalk
This Christmas break I took a course on Mental Health First Aid. It really helped me learn how to support others. #BellLetsTalk
I can only imagine what others experience. Mental illness is so deeply personal. We all have our own demons.Real perspective. #BellLetsTalk
The more I believed I was making it up, the more I beat myself up for being so self-destructive. It spiralled. #BellLetsTalk
I know that part of the reason that I never talked was because I didn’t think anyone noticed. I thought I was making it up. #BellLetsTalk
The most frightening thing about mental illness is it’s invisible to so many on the outside, but inescapable on the inside. #BellLetsTalk
The toughest thing for me was taking my youngest sister to the hospital this Christmas because she was suicidal. Surreal. #BellLetsTalk
Thankfully, I have the support of a close circle of friends to help. But not everyone knows (or is) so lucky. How can we help? #BellLetsTalk
This has been noticeably with me for the last 8 years. But dealing with it is tough. And scary. I’m still not great at it. #BellLetsTalk
I suffer from deeply entrenched depression. Most days it’s manageable, but there are periods where it’s unbearable. #BellLetsTalk
Even though our society is getting better, and there’s a wealth of support the actual ability to open up is crippling to many. #BellLetsTalk
I have seen so many close friends and family, as well as students young and old struggle with mental issues. #BellLetsTalk
I know personally I struggle with talking about my own issues. Let’s use #BellLetsTalk to open up the conversation. We all need this.
#BellLetsTalk day is today so I’ve scheduled a bunch of tweets ahead of time. Mental Health talk is SO IMPORTANT.
Please tweet out #BellLetsTalk to show your support for a developing and robust conversation about mental wellness and support.

It was a real treat to watch @ms_wirzba in action today! So fun! 
All set up for a classroom chemistry experiment this morning! 
@MissAlyssaChuk Love studyjams!
@MrBertamini @cybraryman1 Thank you kindly!
One place where I've been weak lately as far as collaboration goes is joining Twitter chats. Does anyone have a Twitter chat schedule?
I can grow as a learner, teacher, &amp; professional. I can nurture growth in my colleagues + in my Ss. There's nowhere to look but up.
It's all about growth: plants inspire my teaching philosophy. You see it as decorative elements in all I do. But sends an important message.
In terms of professional responsibilities, my favorite is sharing my ideas + planning w/ other Ts. Collaborative teaching is SO rewarding.
ALSO: @ms_wirzba + I are presenting at 2 upcoming conferences - WestCAST in #Saskatoon &amp; UofC's Education Symposium. SO PUMPED. #abed
SO MANY EXCITING ED THINGS: Yesterday, took part in first planning committee meeting for #lethcamp. Thanks for all who are joining our team!
Really dorky but I'm getting ridiculously excited for a measurement unit I'm planning for March. REALLY. EXCITED.

On the lookout for any Gr. 5 Classroom Chemistry websites to use in regular exploratory activities. Suggestions? Google results are spotty.
Fantastic first day at @OLAlethbridge! Lots of learning and plenty of new smiling faces!
I woke up to "Concerning Hobbits" this morning so of course everything will go well on my first day. #uleth #ulps3
@msbrandford Thank you! :)
In about 9 hours, I'll be starting PS3! Very excited and a bit (read: lot) nervous! #uleth #ulps3
Excited to introduce the site documenting my Inquiry Project during PSIII: 
Unreal that my internship starts in just three days. Incredibly nervous!
I just updated my Weebly website. 
Planning a grade 5 math unit on Multiplication, and I'm feeling uninspired. Anyone have any resources to pump some life into this unit?
I'm doing a Grade 5 Newspaper unit. Not sure how to have students write their articles. Stupid question: Do Grade 5s Google?
@msbrandford unfortunately it's the last one offered at the uni, but you can go to the MHFA website to find other workshops!
Completed day 1 of 2 of Mental Health First Aid. Giving some incredible insights into how to be truly helpful in others' difficult times.
Very excited to announce I just wrote y last exam ever for university! Now, on to PS3, and then graduation (on my birthday, no less)! #uleth
Are we teaching Ss to take control of learning, or let someone else steer them through? Great article for thought! 
Free open-source font to help #dyslexic readers?! Yes yes yes! 
@technolandy Good to hear! I know in my neck of the woods anxiety is at it's highest reported levels. Always looking for new things to try!
@technolandy Just read your article on anxiety and it really captured my frustration as a S + gave insight for my teaching career. Thx!
Today I met my PS3 Gr. 5s, my mentor + my principal. Thank you for making me feel so welcome @GregKostiuk + @OLAlethbridge! I'm excited!

@MissAlyssaChuk @ms_wirzba @missZielthedeal @KirbyFecho Good for me! Thanks, guys!
@jheiding The LRPS tweeted out last night saying it was a business ... but wouldn't say which or why.
Lots of exciting things coming my way education/PD wise! Really excited to be working on several projects!
@Jarred_Braun Thanks! :)
Question: How do you archive twitter chats/hashtags? Is there a website/app for that? #edtech

“@MissDBabey: @MeaganFL 
He was eating crunchy green leaves. All of a sudden he saw a large bird flying overhead.” #ulethed4702
Once upon a time there was a lonely caterpillar hanging out on tree. #ulethed4702
Gonna be doing some fun twitter activities for a class presentation on twitter! Wooo! Seeing some in-class applications!
It is easy to feel "inundated" by all there is on twitter - know how to manage it! The cream of the crop rises to the top! #ulethed4702
#ulethed4702 I like using twitter as a Professional Development tool! Also great for gathering lesson plans/resources from other teachers!

@KirbyFecho How does 3 work tomorrow for our Skype date? cc: @ms_wirzba @MissAlyssaChuk @missZielthedeal
@KirbyFecho Whoops, I meant to say Sunday!
@KirbyFecho How does sometime late morning/early afternoon sound?
@KirbyFecho Thanks, I'll get back to you :)
@KirbyFecho Sure! I'll ask for a time that works for us - what works for you?
I have five teapots somehow. Hobby or obsession? #notahoarder
@KirbyFecho cc: @ms_wirzba @missZielthedeal
@KirbyFecho hey! Myself + some other gals want to put on #lethcamp for next Jan. Could we get your worldly advice on this?
@MDWobotics And some licorice.
Want to get your students asking big questions about science? check out the show #Fringe! Lots of neat clips to provoke thought. #science
I've lived by the phrase "I am all that I have met." What does that mean for your practice? What does it mean to your students? #abed #ulps1
@Currlab Thanks! I'll be stopping by in the near future to pick up some book examples!
@Currlab Doing a project on Bibliotherapy and it's use as an intervention strategy in my Behaviour Disorders course. Any good resources?

I just finished The Fault in Our Stars and it's so good but I'm ugly crying a lot. #TFIOS #imnotcrying #yourecrying Thanks @johngreen :)
Apologies to the guy who thanked me in the PD session today! I was caught off-guard that people knew me. I'm sorry I didn't get your name!
@cdsmeaton I'm sorry I couldn't be there, but thank you very much for taking the time to come out! #ulps1 #uled @ULeth_EUS @ULethbridgeEdu
Key learning: A tough day means you'll start over again tomorrow, not burn a bridge between you and a child. Success is individual. (2/2)
Today I visited Victoria Park High + Pitawani/Sifton Centre. Put my teaching trajectory in focus, as that's where I think I'm needed. (1/2)
@AGraceMartin How flattering - thank you! This is great news to hear!
Real talk: I can't work on my papers right now b/c I'm in a serious texting debate about what the best race in Middle Earth is. #lotr

@shayne_mr I've got one planned tom. TH373 on Experiential Learning.
@KatelyndMarchan Own the experience.
@missmosborne I thought my time was better spent working w/ Ss or visiting other classes - ask your TA what he/she recommends. #ulps1
Okay, this concludes the end of formal questions for the #ulps1 twitter chat. Opening up to other questions from current PS1 students!
To those of you signing off for the night, thank you so much for participating! Thank you for sharing and connecting! Good night! #ulps1
#ulps1
@TrishHaugrud I don't think I've tried that one - I'll have to look it up!
@TrishHaugrud I think I ended up buying that book off the district - I used it so much in both schools!
Very true! RT @Mr_Maek: @MeaganFL @tuckchris also important to get to know and respect the classroom culture the teacher has established?
I agree w/@tuckchris. Taking feedback positively shows great respect, and willingness to improve! #ulps1
@shayne_mr Ha! That's one way to do it!
A5: I really enjoyed having discussions about teaching practice, current trends, and things we were both wanting to know more about. #ulps1
A5: Get to know them beyond their role as professionals! What's their life outside of school like? #ulps1
Last question! We'll do an open question period for about 20 min. after this last one! #ulps1
Q5: How do you establish a good relationship with your mentor teacher? #ulps1
@shayne_mr For me, it's easier to teach in the atmosphere you most enjoy. I love middle school!
@shayne_mr You should be acting and abiding by them, yes. including them in lesson plans - no.
A4: Some days your PoS will feel like a P.O.S. Don't be afraid to ask for help translating it into realistic learning activities! #ulps1
A4: ASK YOUR PLN! Sometimes, I was totally stumped, and a fellow student-teacher, or twitter, saved me! #ulps1
@msbrandford YES! I only write a few things down now!
A4: Weekly meetings w/my TA about the direction the week should take were so helpful! Don't underestimate the value of communication! #ulps1
A4: I could best think about what needed to happen the next day if I outlined things after school. Then, relax before going back. #ulps1
A4: Use your prep time at school! Good for gathering resources, if anything else! #ulps1
@CoryHoffner Thanks for joining! The archive link will be posted tomorrow if you want to check what you've missed!
Q4: How did you manage the time needed for planning lessons? #ulps1
@TrishHaugrud So true!
A3: Be true + consistent to your values as well as the expectations you have of Ss + yourself. Share self expectations w/ Ss as well! #ulps1
A3: Let them see you're human - on my first day in PS2, I told S I was nervous, but excited to be there! Be relatable! #ulps1
@AGraceMartin Yes! These are  things that let students know you are the teacher in charge!
Q3: Be confident. You're in control at the front of the class, so demonstrate that in stature + voice. You ARE supposed to be there! #ulps1
Q3: How did you establish credibility as a practicum teacher? #ulps1
@TrishHaugrud Yeah, I was at Riverside Elementary (gr 4) in PS1, and St. Mary's Middle School in PS2!
@MsMelissaGough Welcome!
@KatelyndMarchan Welcome!
A2: I did a few team-building exercises throughout my PS1 (it was a "Tribes" school). Dedicated time to this is so important! #ulps1
@shayne_mr Been taking those chances throughout PS1 and PS2 :)
@missmosborne Depends on the teacher. I had three days to "work my way in" before I taught.
#ulps1
A2: Also, it is well worth your time to ask students about themselves 1-on-1. Very helpful, and very enjoyable to build rapport! #ulps1
CANNOT overstate this! Always say yes! RT @TrishHaugrud: A2:if an opportunity presents itself, take it. Get involved #ulps1
A2: Ask your principal/TA if there is an upcoming musical you can help with, or  a sports team! Clubs are a good way, too! #ulps1
New question everybody!
Q2: What is the best way to become involved in the classroom? #ulps1
A1: An enriching experience is one where you're as involved with the school as you can be. Stay within your limits, though. #ulps1
@shayne_mr Trust me, it does! I was twitter-challenged at the start of my PS1 last year!
A1: You are coming from a faculty w/ new teaching practice - this you can show your TA! #ulps1
@shayne_mr If you're feeling overwhelmed, the first time I joined I was an observer - remember it'll be archived so you can see it later!
A1: Recall you are part of a TEAM. W/ your TA, your UC, other student teachers, and other school staff! #ulps1
@ADavies7 Welcome!
A1: w/@missZielthedeal: try anything + everything while you have the support + feedback to work on it! #ulps1 Ss are forgiving of new stuff!
My PS1 taught me that the student’s needs come before the lesson’s requirements. #ulps1
Q1: What is the best piece of advice you could share from your own practicum experience? #ulps1
@AGraceMartin We'll open it up to questions later, but for now I have a few we can all discuss together!
@MattFosen @AGraceMartin Definitely dependent on the school, but you can count on login problems with every computer related lesson!
Very exciting to see all who have joined the #ulps1 chat! Talk, just take it all in, or ask questions. My first Q for all is coming up!
After 8PM, I will open up for about 20 min. to those still available as open ended Qs from current #ulps1 students - ask away!
Some guidelines: I will number questions Q1, Q2 for past PS1 to answer. Answer in A1, A2 format. Current #ulps1 Ss: ask questions, interact!
Finally, an archived copy of this conversation will be posted on the EUS website after this evening, should you miss anything. #ulps1

My TA has already asked me to develop my unit for the whole English teaching staff at my school. Feeling proud! #mhcbe #uled #abed #edteach
@MrDanLafferty “Yours” by Mary Robison? It’s sad, but sweet. I still remember it from my grade 10 year.
@DrJayDrNo I learned it through Dr. Bright in the Ed Faculty - it's all hers! All the same, I hope you enjoy the process!
@DrJayDrNo Happy to discuss! Recently did it as a class activity similar to lit. circles. Proved to be rewarding in that context.
@DrJayDrNo Ultimately, their inability to balance leads to these “nuanced” discussions &amp; sound bites. Also issues of public appeal. Tricky.
@DrJayDrNo In so reading and talking about these texts, we hope to make smart thinkers and smart readers. Canada Reads struggles to do both.
@DrJayDrNo (2/2) will make connections with the text, preview + research it, pause to question and think as they read, etc.?
@DrJayDrNo I think this ties in with whether or not a person has the characteristics of a “smart reader”. Are they the kind of person (1/2)
@DrJayDrNo Exactly. If we are truly to be smart consumers of literature, Canada Reads should be a jumping off point only.
Teacher’s in their free time be like: “hey, check out this teacher’s manual &amp; that textbook I’m not actually teaching!” #lifeintherealworld
@DrJayDrNo Bit of both? Rich discussions can bring out important issues. But having 1 book represent those issues is problematic.
Student Textbook: 400 pgs. Teacher’s Manual: 650 pgs. #teacherlife #realworld
Day 2 into PS2 and my TA is already asking to keep a copy of my unit plan. Woot woot! #uled #abed #edteach

@MsLutzmann I tried to DM you but it looks like you have to follow me, too.
Thanks for the chat #plpnetwork!
@bluebirdcat That sounds absolutely fantastic! Creating something new together!
@bluebirdcat Agreed! Wherever it will meet the most people!
@BeccaAdkins3 Perhaps starting small, something like inviting a few out for coffee and seeing if it grows from there?
A12 #plpnetwork I would like to see a T that asks and encourages ways to build my interests into school or community functions.
A12 #plpnetwork Staff email in the morning with a joke - quick and easy, but the thought is there!
A12 #plpnetwork Regular staff outings may not be a bad idea! Go out for appy’s or a glass of wine, perhaps a round of golf or bowling!
A12 regular check ins w/Ts. Builds community, and is a good model for Ss. #plpnetwork
A9 absolutely important to model! Ss see we’re human, and can share similar stories with us or the rest of the class! #plpnetwork
#plpnetwork
A8 I’ve found it doesn’t need to be a grand gesture. Bits of humor as I walk down hall or rows, in between bits of learning. #plpnetwork
A5 #plpnetwork I am grateful and thankful for my career as a T, and that is joy enough. Sharing that w/Ss makes it magical.
A5 I take moments to step back and admire the process. Even a few seconds here and there to appreciate the moment. #plpnetwork
@snbeach Yes!
A4 #plpnetwork Ss willing to take risks in learning, build relationships w/ others, have positive presence in class and around school.
A3 #plpnetwork In some unfortunate cases, the only place Ss May experience joy is in school. Send Ss away better than they were in the AM.
A2 #plpnetwork From a pragmatic perspective, if students are laughing about it! they’ll be remembering it later too!
#inspiredlrn Thank you! Glad to join!

@Mr_GingaNinja It absolutely is! As @hewsonk27 said, totally fatigued at the end of the day, but I can't wait to get back into it tomorrow!
Q5 Conflict management. Recess supervision today definitely taught me that. Not entirely related, but wooow. #uled
@millerg6 Thanks for the follow, and for all you've shared this evening!
@Mr_GingaNinja This is so fantastic and uplifting to read. Something the student can keep forever! Love it!
@hewsonk27 My TA found it on pinterest!
A4 I'm with @MrDanLafferty on this: just your presence is usually enough for most small things. Ignoring negative behavior also key. #uled
@hewsonk27 @AndyTyslau My TA lets Ss get tech cravings out by allowing them to play subject-relevant games once they've finished. #uled
@hewsonk27 Ss put name &amp; time. A bottle of hand sanitized goes on their desk. No one else leaves the room till the first S is back. #uled
A3 Daily exit slip: filling out a sticky note as a "tweet" on the class "twitter feed" - one thing they learned that day! #uled
A3 Agenda routine at beginning &amp; end of day. Sign out sheet for the bathroom. Wash desks before lunch! #uled
@ADCrabbe Hilarious!
A2 An important thing when introducing signals used while you teach - practice! I spent a solid 5 min doing this &amp; it helped a lot! #uled
A2 Echo/Chorus: T-"Class Class!". Ss-"Yes Yes!". Love it! I've also found that Quiet Coyote (both hands) is awesome! #uled
@hewsonk27 It is insanely appreciated - still makes MGMT an important focus for STs, but not so terrifying that we flounder! #uled
A1 I think an important thing to add is that my TA was very clear that I receive the same respect Ss give her. #uled
@Darci_Collier Such an important thing to keep in mind - quickly jumped on the habit of having my kids stop and drop! #uled
A1 Establish expectations! This has made teaching a breeze (ish) so far this week! #uled

@msmrobertson Love that! Student involvement to the max! #edteach
Thank you so much to everyone who participated in &amp; contributed to tonight's #edteach chat!
@Mr_GingaNinja Good point. Make a reminder at the top of the sheet to point out what that check mark signifies. #edteach
A6. Seeing a lot of checklist recommendations on here but what exactly is on those checklists? What criteria are being checked off? #edteach
@MeaganFL Is there a way to get students involved in ongoing informal assessment during class as well? #edteach
Q6: How and when can you immediately track formative assessment during the lesson (particularly if you’re forgetful)? #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton Good point, Kurtis. I had my blinders on there - just mentioned purpose a few tweets ago! #edteach
@jaymelinton The thing I worry about is that Ss will dislike T marking down Ss talk - will this make them nervous? #edteach
Q5. Loving all the tech resources for tracking! What about paper/in-class tracking? As Ss answer Qs in class how do you track that? #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton I would love to check it out!
@WannerZee Thanks for the follow!
@jaymelinton Is this a free software? #edteach
@WannerZee Gets Ss much more involved in their own learning; takes a little pressure off Ts to track it! #edteach
@jaymelinton @alicekeeler I love Google, and I never thought of this! Thanks! #edteach
@SHDHSPhysics Thanks for the follow!
Q4: In terms of a triangulated approach, how can you track the different types of formative assessment? #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton Thanks so much! #edteach
@hewsonk27 @AaronKWB @jaymelinton Erm. *used, not tracked
@Mr_GingaNinja Thanks for joining us Keith! #edteach
@hewsonk27 @AaronKWB @jaymelinton Just important to track and make sure that we have tracked that we've used diff. types. #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton I think a good thing with this to ensure variety might be to have a list of dif. things to pick from. #edteach
@MeaganFL Assessment should never be something that makes students feel threatened or uncomfortable. #edteach
A3. Perhaps another thing: private reflection should happen often to remove any competition/incompetence Ss may feel in the class. #edteach
A3. Choice is important - let Ss shine the way they think they can do best! #edteach
@hewsonk27 Also removes the pressure and lets Ss focus on learning rather than getting the grade! #edteach
Q3: How do you both adapt formative assessment strategies for different students in your classroom? #edteach
@WannerZee I love this kind of activity. Makes self-assessment fun! #edteach
@alicekeeler Ideally, the info shared will help student teachers as they go out into practicum. #edteach
A2 I think it is important to tell Ss that what i take in is not for marks, but for us both to learn about them as learners. #edteach
Q2: As a student teacher, how do  you/will you involve students in the formative assessment process? #edteach
@strait_sarah @hewsonk27 @ms_wirzba Of course! Just another way to make teaching and learning meaningful! #edteach
@ms_wirzba Love this. Getting into a pattern makes it easy to make it a habit! #edteach
.@alicekeeler Meaning when you are in the class teaching, how are you tracking your students' learning?
Q1: What role does formative assessment play in lesson planning and instruction for student teachers? #edteach
@strait_sarah Welcome! Thanks for joining us! #edteach

@Mr_GingaNinja I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE LOLS.
.@JoelBowtell .@JSRyu2015 My mistake. Thx for correcting me. Still doesn't change the destruction and havoc these budget cuts have created.
@LukaszukMLA My mistake. Can't agree that we share a passion. Slashing the #abpse budget isn't showing passion, but disrespect &amp; disinterest
@LukaszukMLA Or possibly your child will face the same lack of programs and opportunities in their #abpse b/c of your actions. What then?
@LukaszukMLA #abpse is no joke. Remember it's on our backs your pension will be paid. After paying our tuition we may not have $ for you.
@DrJayDrNo Agreed. Composing my letter as we speak! Wonder what it would take to get every university student on this... #abpse
@DrJayDrNo Thank you for advocating for the students, professors and university. I hope everyone will take up the call alongside you!
@MissCHarvey You have no idea.

@hewsonk27's twitter workshop reminds me of @jaymelinton's comment: "twitter is a stream: jump in, but don't try &amp; wade through it all."
“@hewsonk27: A teacher's guide to Twitter - Great 1-pager from @fboss 
@Darci_Collier Clear and effective presentation, great implementation of management techniques. Nice work!
@ms_wirzba These online resources made me so pleased. Thanks for showcasing these! #edteach
Awesome job making our learning meaningful with your case study activity! #edteach
@MissCHarvey Inviting discussion for dry material - awesome! This made me think about new things in relation to PoS. #edteach
@ADCrabbe Thank you for your comments on my blog. It is tough to sort these issues out, but we've got to approach it as best we can.
@MrGregoryCraig Agreed. Definitely not a way to teach.
@MrGregoryCraig Agreed. The mistake always sticks in my head far longer than the success. Sad to put it that way, but true nonetheless.
@MrGregoryCraig We do too. For our 1st lesson this semester, I think we all gave it a good shot. I learn best from making lots of mistakes.
@MrGregoryCraig No worries - just poking at you! There are still some people in class who I haven't got to speak with yet. Good job today!
@MrGregoryCraig Haha way to forget my name during your presentation! :-P
How Cultural Shift Will Inform My Future 
Just got caught up on #BreakingBad and I am emotionally devastated. Good one, Vince Gilligan. No amount of consoling will fix this!
@MissCHarvey Agreed!
@MissCHarvey I love it!
@bethanyvsmith Thank you so much! I'll definitely be flipping through these!
@bethanyvsmith Good to hear! Thinking about tackling the issue in one of my own future tech blog posts! :) Any resources you'd recommend?
Little bit of Ed humor to start your day!

Why Group Work Rocks My Socks So Darn Much 
@bethanyvsmith Thank you! It looks like you gave your Ss a handful to think about &amp; they definitely rose to the challenge! Great reading.
@MrDanLafferty Specifically looking at GLO 5, SLO 5.2.1 from the 10-12 curriculum. Involves collaboration &amp; utilizes the 6 purposes of lang.
@MrDanLafferty I thought Ss could work together to build some kind of visual text that would depict the program of studies.
@MrDanLafferty That's an idea I never considered! I was looking at ways to incorporate the SLO we're required to teach into the lesson.
@bethanyvsmith's past student Betsenstein reviews the Digital Divide in the US. I've added my 2 cents. 
Just commented on the blog of one of @jaymelinton's students, Megan Weber, reflecting on an in-school visit. 
@MrDanLafferty I would love share ideas for the curriculum overview assignment! Thoughts?
Informative #PLN workshop! Looking forward to next week's twitter workshop! Any tips for setting up Google+? #edteach
@IanCooke6 What an informative way to demonstrate a plethora of different learning strategies! Brilliant! #edteach
@ADCrabbe Finely crafted microteach. Way to bring all our learnings out in the formation of our "I will" statements! Great chats! #edteach
@laurenmgrover Loved discussion of our own examples with unknowledgeable teachers to examine ways to properly apply your KSA! #edteach
@MrDanLafferty Awesome microteach! Loved that you connected it back to previous lessons and even what we just covered in class! #edteach
#uleth #ps1 #GHI students (other sections also welcome!): We have a #facebook group that you can join! 
Powerful presenting, powerful teaching 
The future of technology in education 
@MissCHarvey, @hewsonk27 and @Darci_Collier Thank you all for your wonderful comments on my blog posting! :)
@hewsonk27 Thank you for putting us all out there! Reading everyone's posts was such a treat - everyone brings so much to the table!
Considering signing up for Pinterest. No experience with this. What do fellow educators think? Awesome resource or info overload? #edteach
#cdnedchat #edtech #edteach
Starting an Excel sheet to track print resources I never want to forget in my teaching career. #protip? #edteach

Blogging in Education happening here in Lethbridge! #blogging #ulethed #yql 
@TeachMrR Thank you so much! I'll definitely be in touch! :)
Found a top resource for English Teachers + The Writing Process. Love it! #edteach #ela 
Not a complaint against the program itself - I am so happy and privileged to be here! Just an adjustment in study preferences.
Reading so many texts for Ed has made me drop my Notes Only, No Highlighting rule. I cringe at the thought, but there's so much content!
@MrDanLafferty Concise &amp; powerful exploration of how you'll incorporate Ned's Gr8 8 into the classroom! #edteach 
@laurenmgrover Presents an enthusiastic &amp; bright perspective on how she'll bring Ned's Gr8 8 into her class. #edteach 
@laurenmgrover On the side panel, there's an icon for YouTube that you can drag and drop onto your blog post. Then it asks for the video URL
@TeachMrR Thanks for the follow! Looking forward to seeing what I can learn from another pre-service teacher!
Ensuring Powerful Learning: A Teacher's Great Eight 
@CallaghanTiff Thank you! Always looking to turn my experience into a learning experience for others. :)
@Darci_Collier Love your analogy of a teacher as a "lamplighter" and a "travel guide" - I totally agree!  
Blogging in education 
@MrDanLafferty @Darci_Collier @MissCHarvey @IanCooke6 @ADCrabbe That sounds good!
@MrDanLafferty @Darci_Collier @MissCHarvey @IanCooke6 @ADCrabbe  Does this mean you have a photographer in mind already?
I just updated my Weebly website. 
@Darci_Collier @KimberlyBlundon Looks like you've got your first blog post as the answer to the Q he posed in class. I think that's right?
@hewsonk27 Thanks - I just checked out the Moodle and realized that. I was worried I had missed the assignment details altogether!
@hewsonk27 Is there a specific topic that we are supposed to write on for the Teaching Seminar blog due Friday?
Hey, GHI, I'm still not sure what we're supposed to be doing for EDU 3508. Could someone please fill me in?
@MissCHarvey I've never heard of this - what's awesome about it?
@hewsonk27 @LearnTeachWu Thanks for the clarification!
@LearnTeachWu Hey, Winnie! I didn't have your # so I though I'd get in touch this way. The draft of our portfolio is due on Thurs., not Wed.
Organizational skills and an understanding of material an methods in your POS is critical. #edteach
@ms_wirzba Love your candid reflection! (and also the Community logo - love that show!)
If you garden them and water them, they make you who you are. Same can be said of your students. #uled 
@MissCHarvey Looks awesome! :)
@ms_wirzba I'll send it your way :)
@Darci_Collier Thank you! I'll be excited to check everyone else's out!
I just updated my Weebly website. 
Awesome Teacher as Performer workshop this morning. Very informative, lots of fun, and it was great to meet all the GHI section. #uled
@ms_wirzba I happen to have a picture readily available on my phone ... For research, of course ;)
@KimberlyBlundon Welcome to twitter! :)
@jaymelinton It was. Always great to get a professional's opinion. :)
@ms_wirzba Your blurb about yourself is just adorable! :)
@jaymelinton Thanks so much for joining our class in Lethbridge today! Very informative.
@hewsonk27 No problem! Excited to get started! :)
@alicekeeler I love Google, and I never thought of this! Thanks! #edteach
@SHDHSPhysics Thanks for the follow!
Q4: In terms of a triangulated approach, how can you track the different types of formative assessment? #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton Thanks so much! #edteach
@hewsonk27 @AaronKWB @jaymelinton Erm. *used, not tracked
@Mr_GingaNinja Thanks for joining us Keith! #edteach
@hewsonk27 @AaronKWB @jaymelinton Just important to track and make sure that we have tracked that we've used diff. types. #edteach
@hewsonk27 @jaymelinton I think a good thing with this to ensure variety might be to have a list of dif. things to pick from. #edteach
@MeaganFL Assessment should never be something that makes students feel threatened or uncomfortable. #edteach
A3. Perhaps another thing: private reflection should happen often to remove any competition/incompetence Ss may feel in the class. #edteach
A3. Choice is important - let Ss shine the way they think they can do best! #edteach
@hewsonk27 Also removes the pressure and lets Ss focus on learning rather than getting the grade! #edteach
Q3: How do you both adapt formative assessment strategies for different students in your classroom? #edteach
@WannerZee I love this kind of activity. Makes self-assessment fun! #edteach
@alicekeeler Ideally, the info shared will help student teachers as they go out into practicum. #edteach
A2 I think it is important to tell Ss that what i take in is not for marks, but for us both to learn about them as learners. #edteach
Q2: As a student teacher, how do  you/will you involve students in the formative assessment process? #edteach
