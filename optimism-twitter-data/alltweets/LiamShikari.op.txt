I did cheeky a chip though 
Had my first casino experience last night. Doubled my money then lost the lot
@_xomilly nah I asked if he wanted them, not as if I got his hopes up <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> even got a "God bless you" out of it
@_xomilly oh par... Well at least the 70p will come in handy I guess
I literally only had Euros in change and about 70p, hope he can cash them up! He was really thankful though which was nice
Yesterday there was a homeless guy outside the station and drunk me gave him a shitload of Euros
Oceana 
@_xomilly bad is hype, luv barry
@CrackTheCameronfatty fatty
Things that traffic can do: 

1) Fuck off
Just witnessed someone pop a Conservative balloon with their cigarette. Respect.
Well in Scotland though, if I lived there I'd fully back SNP
Poor Ed Miliband, I genuinely feel he's done a good job in the run up to the election
11.22am - Nigel Farage quits
11.34am - Nick Clegg quits
12.14pm - Ed Miliband quits
#GE2015
Bye NHS it's been great knowing you.
Peak peak peak
Conservative majority. Peak.
You know when things go wrong and people say "at least we have our health"? Soon we won't even be able to say that
Bet you I get in the office and everyone's partying over the Torys getting in
@tiffeerascal worst human. If you can even call him that
@_xomilly I fucking hope not <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> that would only end badly
A sub-par NHS annoys me mum but you've voted for it <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My mum voted Tory basically on the grounds that Ed Miliband annoys her so she's not gonna hear the end of this from me

"Just put a wet paper towel on it"
Fucking scummy old cunt
I hope Rupert Murdoch drops dead before the end of the newest government
But at least it's not UKIP. Every cloud.
So I'm gonna be nearly 25 before we get a chance to get rid of them, that's a really grim thought
If Conservatives win a majority I think I'll just sleep through the next 5 years
This is not the sort of news I wanted to wake up to
Oh fuck
@coldguinness_ oooh that's gonna take some time to heal, what a burn
@coldguinness_ "happy tory wonderland" isn't the world I want to see in the morning but I'll try and stay optimistic for now at least haha
In bed by 12:45, asleep by 1, cry at my lack of sleep this past week when my alarm goes off at 7. Plan.
I was debating going to bed at half 7; now I'm on the election hype so it's looking like another late one
@suicideseasam yeah that's true. As long as they stay out I can deal with life
Oi nah 
@_xomilly standard Baz, he knows the score
@suicideseasam ignorance is the worst. I reckon Conservatives will smash it here, which I don't like, but it's miiiles better than UKIP haha
@_xomilly Baz looks a bit exasperated there, that'll tie in nicely
@suicideseasam fucking hell what a joke, loads of Farnborough loves UKIP I swear
@_xomilly maybe a cheeky middle finger printed on the reverse too
@beeethanymay ahh well it's the thought that counts, at least you have the moral victory
@suicideseasam nah up by the sixth form, church of the good shepherd!
@_xomilly get some business cards printed so you have a convenient little handout
@beeethanymay yeah very true, surprised they haven't had at least an egging considering there's a shop just up the hill too!
@_xomilly think you got the better par in tbf
@beeethanymay it did make me a bit angry, how can you plaster your house in political stuff like that ESPECIALLY ukip stuff!
@_xomilly fucking hell that's so snobby! I got a few weird looks when I said Labour but played the "I'm not from fancy Surrey" card hahaha
@_xomilly big up the Greens! I had college today and everyone in my class was like "yeah voting Conservative like everyone in Guildford" ffs
@_xomilly hahahaha wouldn't surprise me, wasn't a sight I wanted to see
@CrackTheCameron probably got a lukewarm Chinese once and haven't been able to let it go
You only see it on your way out though so by then it's too late, silly people
When I left the polling station today the house opposite was literally caked in banners, signs and posters saying "VOTE UKIP"
@CrackTheCameron better than Torys though! Nah upon leaving my polling station today there was a house literally head to toe in UKIP banners
@CrackTheCameron the two times I went that way while the signs were up I made sure I was doing the wanker sign, felt like a small victory
Fuck Michael Gove lol
I'm glad my usual route to work has reopened mainly so I didn't have to see the hundreds of "VOTE MICHAEL GOVE" signs down the other way

Ed Miliband: Remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy com…
@_xomilly hahahahahaha that's killed me
@_xomilly they start announcing seats from like 4am but I think I heard the news say it won't be done til like 4pm!
@_xomilly yeah that would be a fucking disaster hahaha
@_xomilly it reckons 316 seats for Conservatives, 239 for Labour, 10 Lib Dems and 2 each for Green/UKIP
When I say dark days I mean a dark 5 fucking years
If that exit poll is accurate dark days are ahead
Don't think mine has a weird fungus thing in, it tastes peng as always
Has it put me off? 
This is not a post I want to stumble across while I drink a Capri Sun 
@MrPatrickCarter apparently not enough!
I didn't ask who she voted for but I can probably guess
"He's so annoying, I want to slap him every time he's on tv"
My mum would rather David Cameron than Ed Miliband on the grounds that he "pisses her off"
Ordered a pair, well excited for them to get here already
These are fresh 
#IVoted
In this day and age how are there still taxis that don't take card
@_xomilly I thought it was two then a tweet on here threw me off, bastards
@_xomilly siick, that's good
@DeanBeaven sweeeet!
@_jcken ah sick, that's good then!
You do get a vote for the local area and a national one this election right? I'm not making that up am I?
Green Party for the local elections it is then 
The Saturday of Wireless is a must
@d3athrattle oh god <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@HollieShikari fully agree, it really doesn't make sense. Young people deserve a say in how their country is run!
It's a bit naughty that 16/17 year olds can't vote, I'd say I was definitely responsible enough to do so at that age
Also a vote for Conservatives is a vote to get rid of the Hunting Act, which would be nothing short of a disaster for animal welfare
Let's not let the Conservatives fuck the NHS for another 5 years
If you're registered to vote please do so, none of this "it won't make a difference" nonsense
@_adamjames I can't see myself not going back next year hahaha, far too much fun!
@_adamjames you know, I wanna go back more than anything! Only regret is not staying longer <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I've got far too many stories from that holiday but I won't bore you all with them... yet
Yeah love let me sniff a fatty off your one year olds head x
When I was in Ibiza I got offered cocaine by a normal-looking woman who was pushing her baby along in a buggy
Actually don't care I've just remembered I'm seeing Fatboy Slim this month
Why the fuck am I still awake YET AGAIN
@_xomilly might set a pack of dogs on him and chase him on horseback :) banter :) good sport :)
@_xomilly he voted "very strongly against" both the foxhunting ban and equal rights to marriage, bit of a dildo if you ask me
@_xomilly believe so, sad day for Rushmoor
(Deliberately tweeted his full name 'cause we all know how MPs like to search themselves on here)
Gerald Howarth is pretty much guaranteed the seat anyway and he's a fucking bellend
That being said if there's a Green candidate in my constituency they can have my local vote
The idea of having a Conservative government for another five years worries me. Come on Labour pull it out the bag tomorrow!
@rhixob send him 
"Local" meaning the South
Literally my favourite night out in the local area
Southampton Friday, should be cheeky
I got back at 8am Monday.
Just realised I haven't unpacked my suitcase yet
@_xomilly innit
The fact that I stopped for 2 months then started again is beyond peak
I'm 100% quitting again in July though, worst habit
I brought 200 cigarettes back from Ibiza, guess how many I brought to work today? One. I am a fool.
I'd forgotten about the patio door incident, that was so peak hahahaha
@ambchanel @MattTheHero @rhixob @PissOffSam FFS <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE><DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Took this on my flight, sights like that are the reason I love flying so much 
Sick one that I'm still awake
@Pterodactdyl @TravisInTransit @MattTheHero @CrackTheCameron that really is the worst news
On a brighter note I've won at least £10 on Euromillions two weeks in a row now, wahey
I want a foot spa filled entirely with aftersun
@TravisInTransit @Pterodactdyl @MattTheHero @CrackTheCameron this is fucked
@Pterodactdyl @MattTheHero @CrackTheCameron @TravisInTransit nah what
@CRJG_ what a joke! I was hoping it guessed at least close to my proper age hahaha
Has it actually got anyones correct age, ever?
That age thing put me at 28 &amp; 47 on two pretty similar pictures
@CrackTheCameron <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> best thing
@ellanelson_ I can't see her losing that seat either which is pretty sound!
@ellanelson_ Caroline Lucas is a babe, you guys are so lucky!
@ellanelson_ big up having a Conservative as your local MP..
@oliemichablabla what a joke! Politicians need to sort it out
@beeethanymay I have yeah, it makes me feel a bit ill. Probably the only party worse than Conservatives in my eyes!
He also voted very strongly against the hunting ban. SIGH.
Just given that They Work For You website a spin and the MP for my area voted "very strongly against" equal gay rights. Sigh.
There's a load of "vote Michael Gove" signs on my way to work and I can't help doing the wanker sign as I drive past
@d3athrattle what a tune. Raincoat (oat oat ay ay ay) is another good one
@d3athrattle hahahahahaha! Thinking about it, she does have a few bangers...
My music taste has gone to shit over the past year hahahaha
That Money song by Rihanna is such a jam
@NicolaaaScott best of luck!
@TravisInTransit @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero gonna have to revisit Ibiza and buy some off the looky looky men
@TravisInTransit @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero biggest par, I was gonna go in a couple of weeks!
@LiamShikari @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero @TravisInTransit
NAAAAAAH :( 
FUCK YES NO MORE LONG JOURNEYS DOWN THE M3
MY USUAL ROUTE TO WORK IS OPEN AGAIN
3 hours left, then hometime, then probably straight to bed lol
Oooh there's a new 3-room club opening in Fleet, naughty
It's a nice sunny day here yet I'm still bloody freezing, take me back to Ibiza plz
Not booking today off work was a poor decision on my part
I'm out of aftersun. RIP feet.
Ends 7/5/15 1pm
T&amp;C's 
Can't be fucked to be back to work tomorrow, so wish I'd booked an extra day off
That was a sleep and a half
The one bonus to being back is my bed, I've missed it so much
I'm home, boo England sucks
My feet are redder than the Devils dick
I'm fucking wasted and I have to get on a plane, nah
I've had such a sick few days, so sad it's over
At the airport. Flight is at 4:20 #BlazeIt
Ibiza has been amazing. Definitely coming back 
Driving to work on Tuesday should be fun <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
What I've learned from Ibiza is if you're gonna take your shoes off in 28 degree heat, you need to remember to put sun cream on your feet
Gonna miss this place a lot
Last night in Ibiza, emotional
They are literally lobstered.
I have the worst sunburn of my life on my feet right now
@rhixob been topping up every 45 minutes, still burning doe <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I feel like I'm getting the better deal here 
@d3athrattle <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS><INFORMATION DESK PERSON><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>
Definitely coming back to Ibiza, maddest place
Jc'ing 
@d3athrattle I am mate, thank you! Hope England is it's usual average aha
Swag 
Trod on my sunglasses when I was wasted last night, haven't even wore them once
@d3athrattle happy birthday mate! <PARTY POPPER><PARTY POPPER>
@ctr246 update: 
@ctr246 indeed! It seems to be that, a selection of meats and cereal. No croissants <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
The bar we went to last night kept giving us free shots, obviously we made an impression <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
We got a full English, I was fully expecting continental-only
It was good of the hotel to provide us with a drinks cooler 
Brag brag brag brag brag
It's 9am and it's hot as fuck. Loving life
What's up world 
See me and skeota in the video with a nostalgic backed rop
Oh don't wake me up fuck
Sat in boxers on balcony wasted
How a everyone doubt
Wasted
Ibiza is fucking f sick
Yo
@d3athrattle I won't miss England either <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
We have boarded, enjoy England suckaaas
"We have a full flight, anyone can check their hand luggage into the hold for free" lol no
Airports are kewl 
Should be flying out to Ibiza in the next 30 minutes, the excitement is real
@thatkidboy thank you! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I will try my best hahahaha
I've only forgotten to pack 4 things that I know of so far, better than I was expecting to be fair
Waiting for the train to the airport then Ibiza here we come! So stoked
Going to Ibiza today <BLACK SUN WITH RAYS><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS><BLACK SUN WITH RAYS>
There's not even one bun person in my class which is basically unheard of in my world
Wasn't sure about the people on my course at college first but they're all safe as fuck to be honest
How can a train be "detrained" from a train, I don't understand
Guy on the news, representing Southern rail, just said "one train was detrained from the train", I'm sorry what the fuck does that mean?
If you're considering voting Tory I'd recommend giving this a read: 
Anyone free in the day tomorrow?
@zacxmahrouche best day
The best part of this article is the fact that there's a gynaecologist named Dr Cockburn. 
If I had the dollar I'd so do it though, don't even care
Plus a £9,500 excess <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
It would cost me £26,990 to get insured on a Lamborghini Aventador
This time tomorrow I'll be frantically doing all my holiday shopping. Still need a cheap pair of sunny g's and bare toiletries
Oioi 
It's clear to me that voting Labour is gonna be the only way to keep the Torys out this election. Definitely the lesser of two evils.
That Milibrand interview is great, wish he'd done it before registering to vote closed though
@siaanlike I didn't think of that, good shout!
I'm up at 7, life sucks
@briefcasem0ng that's cheeky, really wish I'd thought of that! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> I'll have to try Superdrug/body shop cos that's basically all we have
@briefcasem0ng I need them in time for Friday <CRYING FACE> for future reference tho do you do ones that are less than 100ml?!
All my toiletries need to be under 100ml for the plane, anyone know where to get one's that are cruelty-free?
I'll stick it on eBay another time, I got like £30 for a broken Blackberry on there ahahaha
(I didn't hit it with a hammer but it won't turn on)
If anyone wants to buy a broken HTC One X let me know lol
@fuckoffcoldplay I'm expecting big things then! I do love a good comedy
@fuckoffcoldplay I may do actually
@fuckoffcoldplay I shall give you some feedback tomorrow then!
@fuckoffcoldplay if it's on Netflix I'll give it a spin tomorrow evening
@fuckoffcoldplay nah that's mad! I'll give it a watch when I'm done and be like "been there, been there"
@fuckoffcoldplay never, I've heard good things though
I think I might smash it with a hammer for wasting so much of my fucking time
I've spent literally about 7 hours of my time trying to restore my old phone back to factory settings and still no luck
@fuckoffcoldplay hahahaha fuck that, no night out is worth that sorta money just for entry
@fuckoffcoldplay that sounds like fun! I think our general plan is "hey that looks poppin, let's go in there"
@fuckoffcoldplay I'll bare that in mind, I think I read we have to get a boat there? And I've never heard of that club, any good?
@fuckoffcoldplay hahaha fml, I'm gonna hate myself for it when I'm back here again but oh well!
@fuckoffcoldplay San Antonio Bay, 2 minute walk from the beach <DANCER>
It's not even waterproof, I've fully submerged it for like minutes on end and it's still going strong though
I could never own an expensive watch, the amount of times I've gotten into the bath/shower wearing mine is silly
@fuckoffcoldplay it's still on the cards, all dependant on how much holiday I have left at work really
@fuckoffcoldplay I've heard that from everyone! <CRYING FACE> Thank fuck it's payday tomorrow
@fuckoffcoldplay Cameron! (Not the Scottish one)
@fuckoffcoldplay I fly out to Ibiza this Friday, keep up mate! It's all I've talked about on here for the past month <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
26 degrees at 9AM is gonna be fucking heaven, I cannot wait
It's due to be 26 degrees at 9am this Saturday in Ibiza, I hope you lot are ready for me to be gloating a fuckload this weekend
"Don't get rattled Boris" hahahaha yesss Milliband fuck him up!
I've just seen that Ed Milliband/Boris Johnson interview on the Andrew Marr Show and Ed literally pars him, it was incredible
Work done for the week, college tomorrow then Ibiza Friday. I've had worse weeks!
Well well well 
@coldguinness_ I think it was when they were going around the club signing people up in return for a free shot, I did it more than once...
Good effort though
Tru have sent me a happy birthday email offering me free entry, yet they've sent it early so it expires before my birthday even starts
I'm actually exhausted
@CrackTheCameron oh ffs I'd forgotten that <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@WeAllKnowA @_xomilly excuse me
@_xomilly hahahahaha fucking Derek
@CrackTheCameron hahaha you can tell they were trying to empty out at that point
Shutdown by Skepta came on last night and I had a little skank, not even ashamed
Last night was decent, won't be in a hurry to return to Casino though
Messy night
Anyway bed
Telling me to fuck off repeatedly for no reason is a bad move you jizzstain
Fucking cunt
Will I ever be able to go out in the South of England without nearly getting into a fight
@MrPatrickCarter that's so savage! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I hate thisbplace

Should probably get ready for tonight but my sofa is really comfy right now
More often than I'll ever admit.  
@CrackTheCameron no
Because I know you all care 
Could also be fucking terrible, only one way to find out!
MNG tonight, could be a laugh
I'm actually creasing hahahahaha 
@Markkisonfire either that or playing the "I'm so quirky please love me" card hahaha
Boris Johnson really is a fucking tool
Watching Wheel of Fortune and Bradley Walsh is the presenter, since when was that a thing?!
Vengaboys Greatest Hits is now downloaded and on my phone ready for Ibiza

How can Boots try and charge £42 for a pair of sun glasses. You're Boots not Ray Ban.
@suicideseasam I feel that's for the best <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@suicideseasam kill it
Daily update: 
24/26/28 degrees then drops back down to 20 on the day I leave, not bad at all!
Current weather forecast reckons it's gonna be 28 degrees on one of the days I'm in Ibiza, that's SO tight!
@Pterodactdyl fair enough, any amount is better than none I guess
@Pterodactdyl amazing hahaha. I don't think I'd be able to help myself having a sneaky glass or two
@Benem0th oh damn, that's a letdown! I never expect crispy bacon from fast food places though to be honest
@Pterodactdyl I try not to have it too often so the treat factor doesn't wear off. Best orange juice variety for sure
@Benem0th I had no idea! Now that's service if I ever saw it hahahaha
@Pterodactdyl quite frankly I'd just get two muffins if I didn't love Tropicana so much!
@Benem0th I always get a double bacon and egg mcmuffin! Do they do normal rolls too?
@Benem0th bacon things? Sorry?
@Pterodactdyl what the fuck, why. If I see you before it expires you're more than welcome to my instant win haha!
@Benem0th bun the hash brown, all about the Tropicana and the muffin!
@Pterodactdyl deadest part, always too greasy. I eat it first so it's out of the way haha
@Pterodactdyl I've had a medium coke and a fucking hash brown this year, was impressed with the coke to be fair!
And if you get any drink that isn't a Tropicana with your meal you're not to be trusted
The hash brown is the worst part of the McDonalds breakfast for sure
I've never had such a shit instant win as that, including one for a fruit bag I got last time
I got an instant win hash brown today. ONE hash brown, are you having a fucking laugh McDonalds.
I couldn't even watch an animal get killed in real life, I'd be fucked on that island
I couldn't be a part of that. I know I eat meat (call me a hypocrite, I probably am) but I couldn't kill an animal.
Nah lame
Ah nah I was watching The Island thinking how cute the piglets were, I go upstairs for a bath and see tweets about them being slaughtered?!
@TravisInTransit good comedy comes out of Winchfield, albeit at your expense...
@TravisInTransit 
@TravisInTransit well that is what you do with taxis hahaha (unless you're steaming and they don't trust you)
@TravisInTransit also would depend on how long they took to clock that he'd escaped to be fair!
@TravisInTransit if he jumped straight on a train yeah, if he got a taxi somewhere further afield and then jumped on a train he wouldn't
It's been well over 24 hours since I heard about it, he could be a long way away by now
If you were a child sex offender on the run would you really stay in an area local to where you escaped from?! Just saying
So a child sex offender escapes from a nearby hospital, is STILL on the loose, and I've only heard about it on local news...
@_xomilly I REMEMBER THAT, shit what specimen came up with that one?
@_xomilly "you're from a different country hahaha dick #EDL"
@MattTheHero OH SHIT HAHAHAHA
@_xomilly it's actually the most petty thing ever, shouldn't have ever been a thing
@_xomilly I've never had beef with him but he's such a melt on fb <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@MattTheHero Jacob oliver <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I particularly like the "three lions on our shir" at the bottom of that England picture
What you cannot do, however, is try and justify your horrendous racism by saying "but this is England!!!!"
"Cant even wave my own flag in my own country" yes you can
No one is "offended" by your England flag you idiots
I've just rolled my eyes so hard that they're now stuck 
@_xomilly 2/10 would not recommend
@_xomilly I couldn't do that again if I tried, fuck sake
I've genuinely just cut my tongue on a roast potato
@Pterodactdyl definitely gonna keep that in mind for next time I have an IT related drama <SMIRKING FACE>
@Pterodactdyl I was fully ready to bin it <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> thank you both, much appreciated
@Pterodactdyl you are an actual lifesaver, it's turning on now! Thank you!!
@Pterodactdyl Compaq
@Pterodactdyl it was telling me it was shutting down for 20 minutes so I held the button down, now it won't turn on at all
It's not even in warranty anymore, everything can fuck off
This is the second one this year that's given up on me. That wasn't a fucking waste of £200 at all was it.
My laptops broken, I've had it about three months.
I have to change twice. It's a 20 minute journey.
I'm making the most ridiculous train journey right now because I get to the station 10 minutes earlier than using the direct route
@itsjamierawr around March next year I'll be done! So quite a while really haha
On a brighter note I have a Tropicana which is lovely in this weather
@itsjamierawr most dressed smart for the first lesson then did the same as me, they knew about the dress code though? I didn't!
@rhixob that's just ridiculous
@itsjamierawr until this point I've been rocking up in a t shirt, jeans and trainers, not impressed!
I'll do shirt, trousers and shoes but no chance I'm wearing a tie to college, soz
Shirt, tie, trousers and shoes... at a college?!?!?!?!
Apparently there's a dress code at my college, I've just been informed of this
@fuckoffcoldplay OH MY GOD <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> that was my favourite thing for about a week!
@Pterodactdyl yeah exactly! I'm hoping it's the sort of thing that'll just die out more and more as the generations go on. So sad!
@Pterodactdyl yeah no one should feel like they can't do that, it's just wrong. I'm sure their views will change over time (at least I hope)
@LivvyOnAPrayer yeah I guess so, sad fact of life really
@Pterodactdyl haha exactly, it's beyond comprehension. It makes this country look so tolerant in comparison!
@Pterodactdyl it's so strange how a large bulk of a country can hold such views!
@LivvyOnAPrayer EXACTLY! I can't understand how you can possibly be that closed-minded? Makes no sense
One guy was like "if it wasn't illegal I'd stone gay people to death", that's beyond scary.
Did anyone catch that Reggie Yates documentary about homophobia in Russia? Real eye opener, so scary that places with those views exist
"Maximum stay 1 hour" I'll stay as long as I want thanks
Highly possible that I'm gonna return to Farnborough with a parking ticket but it saved me a 40 minute walk so yolo
@ENTERSHIKARI <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Going home at lunch, if I'm not gonna be learning anything I might as well not learn anything at home instead.
I didn't pay a £9 train fare to be told stuff I already know
This wasn't on the timetable or I wouldn't have come in
I've came into college for nothing, all the stuff we're doing I covered months ago......
Apparently I did have time for a breakfast, result
@_xomilly no bank holiday = no enthusiasm
@_xomilly I had no idea until I saw everyone hyping it hahaha! Such good British people
Happy St George's Day everyone. We don't get a bank holiday so I don't give a shit, but still
Have I got time to get a McDonald's breakfast before college? Answer: probably not but I'm still gonna
I drove to the station and still managed to miss my train, most unorganized person ever I swear
@AnnaShikari I hope for their sake they got some serious dollar for doing that advert, feel so much secondhand embarrassment for them!
@AnnaShikari hahahaha it's literally the cringest thing ever!
The Cortana advert that they did actually makes me feel a bit ill though
Stronger by Clean Bandit is such a tune
Nothing better than taking a massive risk and having it pay off
@_xomilly <DANCER><PARTY POPPER>
@_xomilly hope you're still coming MNG
@_xomilly oh score that's me sorted tomorrow, cheers chummy!
Speaking of partying 
I get to do my first MNG next week, expect drunken shenanigans to be plentiful
@d3athrattle I'm also glad to be part of the "alive" party! Hahaha no way?! Security stood by the gates waiting to shut them, I ran so fast
That was the most insane thing ever
If you've not seen Green Day play live in a tent at 11am you haven't lived
Someone actually rang mine today which never happens, I stared at it in horror for a few seconds before answering
Just noticed our office phone's are the same as the ones in House of Cards, amazing
So tired today, 6pm can't come soon enough
@briefcasem0ng I don't think it's gonna get him. There's only a handful of bands I'm bothered about across the whole weekend! <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Reading line-up is still so meh
Tilford hype 
@SquadUp_ @d3athrattle @MattTheHero I actually remember this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> sounded like you guys were having a blast
@d3athrattle that's not too bad then really! It does sound pretty nice <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@d3athrattle ouch, definitely the lesser of two evils though. Unless you're gonna eat it after it just seems like a waste of a life to me!
Even if you don't want to vote for anyone, go to the poll and spoil your ballot so you don't look apathetic
If you haven't registered to vote and you're able to you're a bit silly really
Think about it, she probably has a tidy lifestyle and all she has to do is make a ridiculous statement every now and then
I genuinely believe that Katie Hopkins either massively exaggerates her views or even makes them up, that's how she brings the dollar home
@d3athrattle I get that it's almost a way of life in parts of the countryside but it doesn't take half a brain to work out how cruel it is <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@roby_nne happened to me once and I was like "oh hold on a sec I'm getting another call" <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@roby_nne this is all well and good until your phone rings while you're having a pretend conversation already
If you absolutely must hunt then at least a gun provides an animal a far more humane death and that's still legal???
Can't understand how anyone, ESPECIALLY the leader of our country can be like "it's fine to set a pack of dogs on animals for entertainment"
lf the ban has stopped even one fox getting ripped to shreds by a pack of dogs, then it has done something for animal welfare.
How can David Cameron say that the Fox hunting ban has done "nothing for animal welfare", fucking moron
Fucking hate Mondays
@Mum4_20 hope you have a good day!!
It's 4/20 which means one thing...... Happy birthday @Mum4_20 <PARTY POPPER>
@CrackTheCameron that's a beauty hahaha
@Markkisonfire you don't wanna know man, it's pretty awful hahaha
@Markkisonfire it involves vomit, I'm gonna leave it at that haha

Lethal Bizzle has the best video on his Instagram right now hahahaha

Ian Duncan Smith should be renamed "twatface" says @LiamShikari  
GAME CHANGER 
@d3athrattle they're a disaster waiting to happen. But I think any party that forms a coalition with them will take a major reputation hit
@d3athrattle you know it! Although to be honest, I'll take anything that isn't Tory/UKIP haha
Probably won't happen but I think a Labour-Green coalition is the way forward
I'm pretty certain he said he wouldn't rule out a Tory-UKIP coalition so for him to try and slate Labour is just hilarious
David Cameron trying to take the high ground hahahaha fuck off you Tory wanker
.@David_Cameron Ed Miliband showed up. You didn't. You're a puss blud.
At risk of sounding like a dick... WHEY WHEY you prick 
@Pterodactdyl I probably would otherwise to be fair
My watch better arrive before Ibiza, it's longing and I'm not optimistic
@Pterodactdyl travel to and from Southampton and pub priced drinks is, needless to say, not inexpensive
Need inexpensive plans for tomorrow evening
People are fucking idiots swear down
To then go and upload the video onto social media is just awful. Would you want a video of an accident you were involved in on the internet?
How much of a cunt do you have to be to film someone's burning car on the motorway as you drive past
Frank is a sneaky guy
Finished season 2 of House of Cards now. It was a madness
@JackWills you're forgiven on this occasion, the size you sent is actually a good fit! Thanks anyway though
Two weeks. Fuck yeah 
Having a Contactless debit card is made even better when you're paid to use it
I retract my complaint about being sent the wrong size as it's a good fit and the one I ordered will have been too small
Wait two weeks for a Jack Wills order to arrive, it gets here and they've sent the wrong size. Tight.
@Pterodactdyl it's so peak! Never wanna see another traffic jam again
The guy with the ukulele that sang "fuck off back to Eaton" to David Cameron is my new favourite
@Pterodactdyl safe for the heads up. Funniest part is I didn't even take the M3 but it fucked the entire surrounding area!
@_xomilly nightmare aint it. Worst journey of my life!
@_xomilly I didn't even use the m3, it fucked the entire surrounding area <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> hope the driver/everyones ite though
Two hours and 40 minutes to do a 40 minute drive is disgusting.
I'm actually livid
I finished work at 6. It's a 40 minute drive. I've just got home. FUCK TRAFFIC
@rhixob good shout!
@rhixob I had it in my mind it was the 16th, felt like such a dickhead. Got her bare ting to (hopefully) make up for it
@rhixob it was yesterday. I'm awful.

@rhixob @MattTheHero @Sn00pDean @CrackTheCameron @Ew0kCunt @TheOneTruePablo @farnborough I've literally just got home, fuck traffic, be asap
I'm not particularly happy right now
Only just got home, as if I hit murder traffic on both runs of my fucking journey
@layna WHAT! That's not on at all
Wish there was a Ben and Jerries store in Woking, would kill for a free cone
@rhixob @MattTheHero @CrackTheCameron @Sn00pDean @Ew0kCunt @TheOneTruePablo efficiency right there
@MattTheHero @rhixob @CrackTheCameron @Sn00pDean @Ew0kCunt @TheOneTruePablo @farnborough ...sorted by the night before hahaha
@MattTheHero @rhixob @CrackTheCameron @Sn00pDean @Ew0kCunt @TheOneTruePablo @farnborough unless it's a weekend she'll have tomorrows meal...
@rhixob @MattTheHero @CrackTheCameron @Sn00pDean @Ew0kCunt @TheOneTruePablo @farnborough my mum will have bought dinner already I'd feel bad
I was fuming
They've shut off Brookwood for roadworks which made me an hour late for work
@rhixob @MattTheHero @CrackTheCameron @Sn00pDean @Ew0kCunt @TheOneTruePablo @farnborough shall pop round after dinner!
She also pointed out I sit with my left hand under my leg when I'm driving and I genuinely didn't realise this until she said
If only she could see the drives I have when she isn't a passenger
I gave my mum a lift for the first time today and she was like "you're such a sensible driver, well done"
No prize for guessing what I'm going to do
Could do something productive, could continue my House of Cards marathon...
@_xomilly @Sn00pDean I prefer the one on the right myself, got a bit of edge to him
@_xomilly @Sn00pDean the two leaders side by side 
@Sn00pDean 
@Sn00pDean yes Dean <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Sn00pDean they're the same party
Home, gonna treat myself to a House of Cards sesh

@Pterodactdyl very true. Reckon my midlife crisis will happen as soon as I hit 21
They're making me a coffee as it's taking so long <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Pterodactdyl I wish I could <CRYING FACE> still don't feel like an adult at all
@Pterodactdyl don't remind me <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Been here for over an hour and a half waiting for this assessment to be set up <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
They've guaranteed that all of the policies they'll implement will be self funded with no extra borrowing, if they can pull it off, hats off
If Labour can actually follow through on their promises (and if they get in) I reckon it's gonna be really good for this country
My mum and brother had third place but they put pussy stakes down so I won more than them <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
£30 richer due to a horse that finished 4th, not gonna argue with that <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Paddypower do customer service well, impressive
Just had to enter my date of birth in order to follow a Twitter account, that's kinda weird
@AskPaddyPower all done, thanks
Need to follow more people on Instagram, give me your thingy and I'll follow you
Still unsure if I'm actually sitting this assessment today hahaha
@paddypower it's been two days since I did the identity verification and I still can't withdraw my winnings, what's up with that?
Taking bets on whether I'll actually do my assessment today; my money is firmly on "no"
Close the lid? 
Arrived for my assessment and none of the staff knew it was supposed to be today <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Had to do a 45 minute walk in 20 and I'm feeling the burn on my legs
I had four alarms set in order to get me up for 1..
Won £30 for 4th place which aint too shabby but I can't withdraw it because @paddypower are shit
The Paddypower website is literally the shittest thing I've ever used
@paddypower why can't I withdraw my winnings and why won't your online support work
Gonna claim my winnings
I got 4th, fuck yeah Alvarado!!!!!
Gwarn Alvarado
Well excited for this race
(Or even in the first 5 places will do)
Alvarado to win the National plz

I was driving down the motorway and some workman chucked a cone straight down my lane and I had to swerve out the way
If I'm going out I've probably not even left my house at 8 let alone gone out for predrinks?
Tru opens at 8 tonight... Who gets to Tru (or any club for that matter) at 8?!?!?!
Mainly for the scroll wheel and the forward/back buttons tbf
I got a wireless mouse for my laptop a couple of days ago and it's a game changer
@Pterodactdyl I'm no good at it myself, I just pick one with a cool name around the 25/1 mark haha!
I won't talk to a Conservative/UKIP politician at my door, soz
"Hi I'm just calling round with regards to the upcoming elect-" "which party?" "Conservatives" "no thank you bye"
@Pterodactdyl my dad rates him too but I think he's the favourite so shit odds :/
I hope there's no injuries this year though, big love to all the horses and jockeys
I have two days to pick a horse and put a bet down, game on
Grand National is Saturday, ayyyyy <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>

David Cameron: come round the corner quick 
And they're doing it for a month, best news!
Sainsburys are doing 10x their usual amount of Nectar points on fuel, which means as soon as I finish work I'll be doing a detour to fill up
I'm too polite for my own good (hard to believe as I can be a dick on here) and I need to change that I think
Season 1 of House of Cards is done. SO good
@fuckoffcoldplay I think I'd have given up on TV for life if I had to witness that <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@fuckoffcoldplay that's genuinely horrifying, jesus christ!
@fuckoffcoldplay what the FUCK

I'm gonna go have a bath in order to recover, holy shit
I've got two more episodes til I finish season 1 of House of Cards but Frank went IN on this episode. So much so that I need a breather.
1. Make eye contact with fellow commuter 
2. Small chuckle 
3. Look quickly ba…
@CRJG_ helpful for all that off-road driving that they need to do in Farnborough! Oh wait...
Since when do police nip around in unmarked Land Rovers?!
Anyone hitting up Shikari in Bristol?
Think me and my teacher got off on the wrong foot last week cause he's being safe today

You have a phone fam, text them yourself
Is there anything more pointless than replying "text me" to someone on social media?
Turning everything off and locking up is a long ting and I will avoid wherever possible
Always try and time going to bed just before my parents so I don't have to shutdown downstairs
House of Cards is brilliant, why didn't I start watching it sooner
@nell53226 fuck off
@Indiegogo you are DISGUSTING.
If I ever tell you "it's a long story" it essentially means "it's a fairly short story but I don't want to tell you it"
@ellanelson_ I'll hurry back as soon as I get the chance!
@ellanelson_ what a banger!
@RobL94 v sorry to disappoint hahaha
@RobL94 they've just deleted it I'm afraid!
Someone who shall remain nameless has the baitest picture of me on their Instagram and I've only found it a month later, peak
@TheOneTruePablo @_xomilly love you more xoxoxoxoox
@TheOneTruePablo @_xomilly is that even a question?
@roby_nne HOW?! Who wants a serving of pepper in one bite! <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>
@Pterodactdyl guess that's an acceptable excuse. I've got so little holiday left once I've booked half of July off it's silly. Will try!
@Pterodactdyl cheeky it! Ah that does sound good, work lyf interferes with that though <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@Pterodactdyl gwaaarn, who needs work anyway?! Last time was Oceana, that's long
@Pterodactdyl yolo it
@Pterodactdyl sounds mental hahaha, nah I'd kick off, don't know how anyone can do it!
@Pterodactdyl I'd rather none than have them whole <UNAMUSED FACE>
@_xomilly I have no idea what's going on 
No one has ever said "hmmm yes put WHOLE PEPPERCORNS in my meal sounds lush"
@_xomilly @TheOneTruePablo I second this notion
Every time I get a parcel my mum plays the "oh what have you bought me?" card. Simmer down Christine
@_xomilly WHAT <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm definitely gonna text you
Work is a little bit busy today
Made it to work in 25 minutes. Boooom
@_xomilly that's a gooden, what an insult cunt bubble is
Only started House of Cards yesterday but it's so good so far
Had to do the walk of shame back to the till so they could take the tag off
Making sure you look as baffled as possible when a shop alarm goes off so the general public know you haven't stolen anything
Actually I'm closer than I thought, I've done well today
Avoiding paying for parking by parking illegally a mission away from town is my speciality
Gotta go clothes shopping. Cba.
@oliemichablabla correct answer
Is today the day I start House Of Cards?
I didn't think I was getting an easter egg and I've ended up with two, saaafe
I've been ridiculously lazy this bank holiday
@divyagill_ @SharanGilll happy birthday you two! :)
@_xomilly madness, had no idea! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@_xomilly can't do tonight mein freund, is it even out yet?!

@DyllanShikari @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero @TravisInTransit this is close to Ibiza but if my saving goes well I might be able to cheeky
@LaurenceHebberd happy birthday buddy!
"This morning" being half 2 in the fucking afternoon of course
Feel fresh this morning
I'm too hungover for my mum to be trying to banter me
It wasn't even a taxi, just someone waiting for her mates who we chucked money at and got her to take us home
Just remembered we stole someones lift last night hahaha
I cannot face going to the shop, at all
Two tropical Relentless's to my door, £5 plus whatever change is in my wallet plus a firm handshake
I'm in a bad way this morning
I really don't wanna get out of bed but I'm so thirsty, when will I remember to take a bottle of water to bed after a night out
What a night last night was
If you bring me two relentless to my door I will give you £5
Fucked

I'm missing the leaders debate to go get drunk, so good luck to my boy @Ed_Miliband you can do this xxxxx
Trying to open a Capri Sun while driving was harder than any of my GCSE exams
Surely it doesn't take a month? Praying I got away with it
Does anyone know how long it usually takes for a speeding ticket to come through? I got flashed by a camera like a month ago, still nothing?
Honestly hats off to people that pull off creative advertising, that takes some skill
@iHateFobs fully expected you to say this was an April fool's joke today. Fair play to you <FISTED HAND SIGN>
That was proper stressing me out though, having a teacher insist you're wrong when you know full well you're not ain't cool
AAAANYWAY he apologized and I think we're good now
Don't try feeding me wrong information you fool <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Even had the head of my course backing me and she basically said to me "if he can't do the job we'll find someone else"
He was trying to get me to do something incorrectly, so I told him, he insisted it was right and got proved wrong
Got off to an awful start with my new teacher, excellent
@_xomilly okay, I'm lost <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> what even happened?

@fuckoffcoldplay I have literally nothing else to blame so it'll have to do
I'm up in less than 5 hours fuck off
I'm devastated that it's 2:06, genuinely thought it was just gone midnight
If you name a large town or a city I probably know what county it's in
If there's one thing my job has made me good at it's knowing what county towns/city's are in
I might risk not bringing a coat to college tomorrow
Even though there's far better clubs (ie most of them) I've never had a bad night out there
I haven't been to Tru in long, I miss that place
It's Thursday which means the start of the bank holiday weekend which means I'm gonna get white girled later
@_xomilly @TheOneTruePablo #pricks
@TheOneTruePablo @_xomilly can you both fuck off please
@_xomilly I've gotta be on a train for half 8 tomorrow <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@_xomilly I'm going tomorrow fuck sake milly
@DyllanShikari almost definitely
@DyllanShikari won't be getting that sticker then <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@DyllanShikari I'm 100% going to cry I hope you realise
@Tek_One you're the worst sort of person!
Work's going pretty quick today, although after the bank holiday weekend I'm gonna be shit busy
@DyllanShikari not the one
@DyllanShikari from now on though if I say "hold me to it" and I've had more than three drinks, please do not hold me to it
I signed up to getting a tattoo while I was wasted and now I'm being held to it, shit
@DyllanShikari ffs <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> I'm shitting it now. Guess I'll start thinking about where I want it
@DyllanShikari fuck sake. I can't do it before May 4th or else ill have to actually take care of it in Ibiza and that's just a chore
Well played.
Did I really get caught out by The Lad Bible with an April Fools
Haven't heard this song in yeeears
Radio 1 whipping out the old school tunes
@DyllanShikari oh jesus why do I open my mouth when I'm drunk
Feel so blessed to get bank holidays off, I can see why everyone in this country hypes about them now
One day of work, one day of college then four day weekend. Sounds pretty fuckin sweet to me!
@_xomilly your generosity is always appreciated
@_xomilly <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> sorry my friendship is such a burden
@_xomilly yeah mate that's my favourite song ever

I'm pregnant LOL APRIL FOOLS
Gotta get Summery stuff for Ibiza and smart, formal clothes for work. Which means visiting more than one shop. Long.
If you know me, you know I hate clothes shopping
I'm slowly coming to the realisation that I'm gonna be spending my bank holiday weekend clothes shopping

Whoever won the Euromillions today is missing a trick if he doesn't wait until tomorrow to announce it
The Bieber roast is actually worth watching, so funny
I'm sure I'll get over it
Just remembered I still get paid for sick days, shit now I feel bad
Feel bad but today was horrendous and I'm feeling worse than I was at work earlier
Pretty certain I'm gonna be having tomorrow off ill so I can recover
At least if I get being ill out the way now I'll be alright come Ibiza
This illness needs to do one
I felt pretty good when I woke up then come about lunchtime at work I felt like poo for the rest of the day
Rather enjoying my deformed nipple right now
Took out the nip piercing for good, I've caught it on stuff one too many times

I let my mum use my car to do some shopping and now she's plotting to steal it
@adaraholland I'm so annoyed about it!
It's not even noticeable but my paintwork is otherwise flawless so I'm not happy
In related news does anyone know roughly how much it is to get a scratch sorted out?
Why can't people be careful opening their doors, I always am, have a little fucking respect.
Someone's opened their door into my car and chipped the paintwork, for fuck sake
I'm so ill jesus christ

@ConkQuitTheBand @MattTheHero @Sn00pDean @TravisInTransit @CrackTheCameron wheeeeeeyyy!
@_xomilly mugged myself off massively
It's cool I love the long as shit walk from Blackwater anyway
Somehow missed my stop on the train, how peak
@ambchanel hahaha makes sense. Gotta be all that weed slowing down their responses
@ambchanel oh really? Everyone we bumped into was cool, then again I'm used to miserable southern people <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
That zipwire they had the year I went was such a brilliant idea
One thing about Download that's better than most festivals is they always kill it with on-site activities
@ambchanel it's such a lovely city! It's like something from a film. Ah that sucks, it was stupidly windy when I went!
@ambchanel ah that's all good! Hope you have a good day and had fun in Amsterdam you lucky shit
Bye bye irritating IT class
Just asked if I can leave and work at home instead, they said yes, scoooore!
The one other person on my course has gone home blagging illness, which was my plan after lunch. Dammit
"Come out tonight" "nah I've got work tomorrow" "go on" "okay then"

@DyllanShikari that's the spirit!
@DyllanShikari hahaha foam parties are the best though!
Potentially booking an Ibiza excursion tonight, maaaate
On break I'm going to Poundland and getting a cheap pair of headphones so I don't have to listen to these guys talk about servers and shit
I can't think of a more boring subject to study than IT, and I'm studying Accounting, the most stereotypically boring subject in the world
The only browser discussion that needs to be had is: "do you use chrome" "yeah" "same"
They're now discussing internet browsers in depth
One just cracked a joke about gigabytes and it went straight over my head
The IT class keep making jokes that I don't understand
I wouldn't mind if we hadn't been doing IT shit for the past 4 weeks but this is getting silly now
I couldn't give even the slightest shit about IT
I'm ill and I didn't get out of bed for this
No teacher again so we've gotta sit in on an IT lesson.
@ctr246 that's a bargain!
@AnnaShikari couldn't agree more! Being a total cock and crying banter when someone calls you on it is far too common these days
Fucking hate trains and I definitely hate paying nearly £9 for a journey that would cost me about £2.50 in petrol
The college I go to has a large underground car park but as they've decided it's for staff only I have to spend £8.60 on a train, cool
I can be a right knob but I like to think I know where the line is; if I cross it I say sorry rather than "lol it wuz banter doe"
I think the phrase "it's just banter" needs to be retired. If it was just banter you wouldn't need to clarify that it's banter
@d3athrattle some of the people on this site make Clarkson look like an angel!
Being "edgy" is one thing but some of the stuff that some people try and have a joke about can be straight up disgraceful
Stop being wildly inappropriate and passing it off as humour

A few episodes of Bojack Horseman then bed I think
@DyllanShikari letdown!
@DyllanShikari so Dyllan, what you sayin 5th April?
@DyllanShikari NAH WHEN
Tru are having another foam party, naughty
Used to ignore bare snaps then the person would be all like "why you ignoring me fam"
The main reason I stopped using Snapchat was because I hated having to assess whether a snap was sent to everyone or just you
As soon as I heard the news I couldn't help but think back to that "Zayn Ditches The Fags" headline and have a quiet chuckle to myself
Creasing at my last retweet, more than I should be
As a Top Gear fan that SUUUUUCKS though and I can't say I'll be inclined to watch it again
If we're honest, of course the BBC were right to sack Clarkson
A motorbike also steamed it past me on the way to work, he must have been doing at least 80 and must also have a deathwish
He can't hack them bends
The car in front of me very nearly stacked it on Pirbright Racetrack (as I have affectionately nicknamed it)
@fuckoffcoldplay exactly that!
In fact it draws attention to the fact that you have a shit car so if anything it makes it more shit
Putting a loud exhaust on a shit car doesn't make it any less shit
Ibiza for a few days in May is looking very likely <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
If I go to Ibiza this year the plane ride will be spent listening exclusively to We're Going To Ibiza by Vengaboys
@FitnessMadEmma that doesn't shock me to be honest :( I take it easy down there but thanks for the warning anyway!
@Tapmeasnoutjaan Ibiza may be in the pipeline hahaha, I'll see what I can do mate!
@Tapmeasnoutjaan I'm hoping for somewhere a bit more exotic ;)
@DyllanShikari oh dear god can I put myself through that... Might have a look at prices hahaha
@DyllanShikari I'm not stooping that low ;) I want either sun, party or weed
@DyllanShikari so bun, don't even care where I just wanna escape this country hahaha
@DyllanShikari Amsterdam was like £350, that's more than it cost us for the week, booooo
Apparently holidays are quite pricey during easter bank holiday, who'd have guessed it?!
Genuine question, I refuse to waste a 4 day weekend
Last minute holiday over Easter bank holiday weekend anyone?
I'm pretty tired so I might go to bed now and avoid the inevitable "not being able to sleep" issue that'll happen later
New route to work is significantly better
I'm fucking tired
@mark_reddie I'll look into that, cheers
There must be sleeping pills you can buy at a pharmacy right? This is bullshit that can't continue
Might genuinely book a doctor's appointment, even if I'm tired for the entire day I can never sleep before 1am, that can't be normal?
I'm so mad that I'm up at 7 yet can't sleep until a stupid hour like this one, just like every single weekday
My sleeping pattern takes the fucking piss
A couple of days ago it got caught on my duvet and I woke up to blood
Considering taking my nip piercing out, I keep catching it on shit recently and it's agony
If I ever win the lottery that is where I will live. Actual goals.
Basically the whole of the Wentworth Estate gives me insane house envy
Last retweet is very important
Why was I not going this way originally it's like 15 minutes faster?!?!?!?!?!?!
It took me about three weeks of Sat nav-ing to learn my route to work. I've been shown a new route today and I'm 90% sure I've got it nailed
Although some of the bends are absolutely savage hahahaha
It involves going down Pirbright Bends which is probably the most fun road in the local area, scoore
My Dad took me to work today so he could show me a quicker way to get there
It took me 7 hours to reply to a text I got yesterday, considering my phone rarely leaves my side that's pretty bad
I regularly procrastinate replying to texts and it's getting out of hand
@RobL94 hahahaha yeah that could read quite bad actually
I always think "I'll take it just in case" then just whip it out all the time <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Genuinely gonna ban myself from taking my card on nights out because I've spent far too much money
Jesus christ when will I learn not to take my card out with me
Just checked my bank balance after Friday nights antics and it's worse than I had imagined
Off Their Rockers is Sunday TV done right
@TravisInTransit @CrackTheCameron it counts, soz
Oceana has killed me. Big love to kosharules, @camerontomorrow &amp; dyllanfromthepath 
@TravisInTransit @CrackTheCameron you've rinsed half of my pouch of tobacco, we'll call it even <WINKING FACE>
I can write today off and still have another day to just chill out tomorrow rather than just jumping straight back into work
Going out on Fridays is so much better than going out on Saturdays
I was debating getting the lasagne and chips, I'd have came home to a second lasagne and chips
I've not long had a pub lunch and now dinners ready, jaysis
@DyllanShikari I'm so done
I fell over trying to leave the shower, jesus christ
I am in a bad way
It's 6pm, I've finished work, the weekend is upon me
@DyllanShikari that's so cheeky
@DyllanShikari 75p?! Fuck it, moving to Southampton.
@DyllanShikari nah, I need this in my life
@DyllanShikari THIS IS A POTENTIAL GAME CHANGER WHERE DO YOU IBTAIN SUCH A DRINK
@DyllanShikari HOLD UP THATS A THING
@DyllanShikari can always count on you to have my back <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I guess they say third time lucky for a reason
Left the office for a smoke, forgot my lighter. Went back to get it, got distracted, left the office again and forgot my lighter AGAIN.
How do these people function on a day-to-day basis??
"Surely if I hire a tank the BBC simply HAVE to give Clarkson his job back"
ID checks there 2 years ago consisted of: 
"Have you got ID?" 
"No" 
"Okay show me any card to make it look like I'm checking it"
@DyllanShikari sorted! Let's get wasted and witness me have awkward small talk with people from my old work
I'm still gutted I didn't go last year and therefore missed Sneakbo and Krept &amp; Konan <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I do love that festival, the fact it's free entry and BYOB is just madness
The Qemists are headlining Basingstoke Live this year, that's tight
@Char_Kie same here! Shit times 
I'm still bummed out that I didn't get to see the eclipse
Seems like British weather is gonna spoil this eclipse, ffs
@Markkisonfire I hope so, isn't it due to start shortly though?
I look outside and all I see is clouds, fuck sake
Anyway definitely time for bed now, was meant to get an early night ffs
Good points made on both sides though but most of Osbournes pars were very schoolyard-esque
Finally got round to watching the budget, Milliband did really well at calling Osbourne on his bullshit
@DyllanShikari I try my best
Gonna get an eclipse selfie for sure
Gonna be driving to work for the first part of the eclipse tomorrow and it's almost certain I'm gonna pull over and watch it for a bit
I feel like I should unlike that page now but I might just leave it for the nostalgic value
14-year-old me would be proud of present me 
@DyllanShikari sent you a DM, top secret stuff
@DyllanShikari hahahaha believe me I was too, especially as I'm fairly certain it'll be repressed at some point this year
@DyllanShikari I sold a certain vinyl a couple of weeks ago for £75 with postage, felt like such a baller
@DyllanShikari hahahaha you're actually right! Put em up when they finally bugger off for maximum £
The Best In Town was a quality album for its time but I can't say I'm gonna miss them
Let's not pretend that The Blackout breaking up isn't long overdue
@LiamShikari panic over 
FFS ARE YOU JOKING 
I'm just gonna turn it off
It specifically says don't turn it off but I'm seriously losing my patience
My laptops been doing this for half an hour 
@MattTheHero surely someone in my carriage must be though, they also had to suffer through it
Crying baby on my train, why must bad things happen to good people
I'm just gonna yolo it and have one when I get in
"I won't have a nap or I won't be able to sleep this evening" evening comes and I can't sleep anyway
I think I have a new favourite Twitter account
@_adamjames hahahaha no way?! That's incredible <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
We spent about an hour talking about torrents and how to get around the fact that they're all blocked, incredible
Not complaining mind because he's hooked me up with an Excel package worth £2000
The teacher that I have at the moment is actively encouraging us to pirate everything
There are so many attractive people in Guildford, like damn
I wasn't even next in the queue but the lady in front of me was too polite to say anything, she gave me the "thank you" nod though
Ha when people jump the queue and then act surprised when I call them out on it, not happening buddy <WAVING HAND SIGN>
My dad gave me a lift to the station, big up
I'm fucking exhausted.
Punch me in the face if I don't get an early night tonight
I've got a funny tweet in my drafts that deserves peak-time Twitter but I only ever remember about it at stupid hours like this
I think the thing I like most about weekends is because I'm not working I get a good 10 hours sleep instead of scraping 6 if I'm lucky
@RobL94 seems legit!
@d3athrattle gotta share the love! Hahaha they do make a very good case I must admit
And a huge house in Virginia Waters... I don't think I'd say rich very long somehow.
Oh and my Lamborghini. Can't forget my Lamborghini.
@CRJG_ sounds like they've got a very niche market there <WINKING FACE>
And of course hook my entire family up
If I ever win the lottery I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't make a substantial donation to charity
Let's do something this weekend @Farnborough @TheSurroundingArea
I need plans for the weekend, ideally involving alcohol
@DyllanShikari 100%. I miss it so much!
Literally I earn around £800 a month, half of it goes straight away on bills and I still have enough to put some away into savings
I have no idea how/when I became so good at saving but I'm so thankful I am
@DyllanShikari it was absolutely terrifying. So glad we only stayed in that hotel for the night, the other one was so swag
Does anyone actually enjoy the work of Meghan Trainor? What an absolute cunt
I'm super excited for the solar eclipse on Friday
@ellanelson_ I can't see a single practical use for those. People will buy anything if you slap a logo on it hahahaha
@ellanelson_ what on earth is THAT
@DyllanShikari @CrackTheCameron  let's party
@DyllanShikari I'm still not over that. Why put those stupid fucking tiles there in the first place?!
@oliemichablabla not a bad way to spend a Tuesday night!
@oliemichablabla you know haha!
That's Not Me by Skepta will never not be a banger
@TheLegendOfLeo you won't be able to not notice it now!
So glad my car finance is 0% APR, bun that
Like I saw one today that's gonna be paying back like £450,000 for a £100,000 loan
Working for a finance company has opened my eyes to just how expensive finance can be
@TheLegendOfLeo it's so simple yet so good! I couldn't help but notice he kept changing between two outfits in it though, continuity errors
@TheLegendOfLeo best song
@TheLegendOfLeo 500 horses Django
I can hear my dad shouting at the football from the bath
@rhixob YES! Just signed it <FISTED HAND SIGN>
I look forward to Nerd Alerts on Radio One every Tuesday and I got far too excited when @ENTERSHIKARI were featured on it tonight
Too early for this shit
@Sssnakepitbitch @Benem0th it's the right way to be!
@Carlykays yes exactly that! Cannot see how testing on animals can be justified for such superficial reasons, it's not right
@Benem0th you know it!
@briefcasem0ng you know Lay tow
I'm not even vege and have no desire to be but I can't allow animal testing for non-medicinal reasons at all
I'll happily spend double on something if I know it hasn't been tested on animals
Googled it and it would seem there's a number of good clubs in Bristol, wahey
Are there any good clubs in Bristol?
Bath, change into new pyjamas, Gogglebox and bed is looking like the rest of my day
I planned to have a productive day today. I'm still in pyjamas.
I'll get to see him twice as long as I can get my T in the Park ticket sorted out, maaaate
I'm far too excited for Fatboy Slim in May
@DyllanShikari next time I have the opportunity that's so happening, madness
@DyllanShikari no way?!?! Is it at the services?
Also why did no one inform me how peng those chocolate coolers they do are?! Kicks the shit out of Starbucks, never thought I'd say that
I went to a drive thru Costa yesterday, game changer
I do love lazy Sundays
@DyllanShikari <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><DANCER><FISTED HAND SIGN>
@DyllanShikari that's actually incredible, holy shit!
@DyllanShikari what. ONE tip?! Oh my days
@DyllanShikari nag even
@DyllanShikari (not to bag but ticket)
@DyllanShikari jesus that sounds like a bit of a killer

That's over £200, I'm actually weeping
Just found 56 car parking tickets, worth £3.60 each, that I didn't get refunded before I left my old job. Bollocks.
It's 2:22am and I'm genuinely debating pinching some of that trifle
I'd 100% cheeky that but I have a feeling it's for Mothers Day
There's a trifle in my fridge and now that I'm aware of that I'm proper craving trifle
@DyllanShikari you should learn to drive, it eliminates the need for legs!
Although I'm fairly certain I got flashed by a speed camera which is irritating
Tonight was good, I liked tonight
@DyllanShikari yeah fuck that, dunno how you hack it!
@DyllanShikari fuck sake Dyllan. Let you off I guess

Me: иσ σиє ∂ιєѕ α νιяgιи, ℓιfє fυ¢кѕ υѕ αℓℓ ιи тнє єи∂.
@Kres_BotRS no way! That's brilliant hahaha
@DyllanShikari amazing, did you get it?
I do love a good funny road name 
@lady_smiler @hysterhia yeah fair enough! It would be better for people who are indifferent to donating plus reducing the shortage of organs
@lady_smiler @hysterhia I guess that's valid, can't really argue! I just feel if they might help someone then they may as well take them
@DyllanShikari as it's technically evening, Common People ticket xoxo
@lady_smiler @hysterhia why just the eyes?
"Hi Mum can you come pick me up, someone did a smelly poo on the plane now I'm stuck at the airport"
Sorry to share a Daily Mail link but LOL 
@coldguinness_ @hysterhia <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@hysterhia yeah that seems dumb, I bet they'd take an organ if they needed one though!
@hysterhia it's so silly, I don't think that many would opt out if they were to switch it
If any of you haven't registered you should, it takes like two minutes and you could save a life.
The fact that you have to opt in to be an organ donor seems silly to me. It should be the default, with people opting out if they wish.
@MattTheHero @TravisInTransit @CrackTheCameron whey whey
@DyllanShikari yessss! Will do!
@fromthestrange dammit, you missed a trick there for sure haha
@fromthestrange if I was the teacher you'd get an A for that
I'd rather get £50 than a present I didn't want personally, but not everyone has my sick frame of mind
I'm so shit at buying presents, I'd much rather be like "here's £50 treat yourself" but it looks thoughtless

Other than that work was pretty decent today!
Hunting through files to find four cheques for about an hour then not even finding them isn't very fun :))))))
@Li0nheart__ you're so lucky! I rarely eat it other than breakfast but I can see myself doing a few trips while it's on haha
@Sn00pDean peak peak peak, I always get a tropicana too so they wouldn't be on them
@Li0nheart__ that's so peak! :(
@RobL94 dammit
@Benem0th apparently you don't, I'm so sad :(
If you do I'm legit getting breakfast every day until they stop it again
Do you usually get monopoly stickers with a McDonald's breakfast?
"I'll let you through the barriers if you buy one at the ticket office" yeah of course I'll get in a huge queue to give you my money...
Now I only have to buy an off-peak single for the way home <SMIRKING FACE>
Got away with not getting a train ticket on the way here
I could murder a Five Guys burger right now, damn
My new teacher still isn't here, fam we start at 9??
I wonder if Guatemala are as worried about top knots as I am
@LiamShikari Guildford ffs
The amount of top knots in Guatemala is concerning
@MattTheHero @LivvyOnAPrayer @CrackTheCameron 
@MattTheHero @LivvyOnAPrayer @CrackTheCameron <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Figured out why my car radio randomly decides to switch to BBC Radio Surrey occasionally and now I feel like a fool
@fuckoffcoldplay ahh okay cool! Hangs for sure though
@fuckoffcoldplay I've just realised what a stupid question that was
@fuckoffcoldplay I missed the word hangs the first time and had to re-read that, Jesus christ. Yeah for sure what uni you going to?
@fuckoffcoldplay Apprenticeship with a finance company, so not quite the same I don't think! I haven't seen her in a while either <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@fuckoffcoldplay that's sick, best of luck with it! I applied at her place once and they turned me down <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm doing an Accounting...
@fuckoffcoldplay oh to be young and foolish. You live and learn though, got a new challenge to focus on!
@fuckoffcoldplay I'm so glad mine pays more than that, so dire! But it's a foot in the door for some. Really sucks there aren't more!
@fuckoffcoldplay ...gives employers the chance to ignore the minimum wage laws. Win win for all!
@fuckoffcoldplay that's very true, I was so worried it'd happen to me! I think there should be a lot more tbh, the demands there, plus it...
@oliemichablabla hahaha sounds about right! "Lemme just flick through my photos and see if I can piece it together"
@fuckoffcoldplay this. At the same time though, there's a lot of "careers advisors"/teachers that make out like it's the only option!
@oliemichablabla too polite to be me! "Fuck off I'm hanging out my area" *door slams*
Have a feeling from the way he says "hello" and how quickly he seems to answer that they were probably knocking for a while too. Terrible.
How rude showing up at someones house to try and get a story?! It's bad enough when they lurk around outside, like a pack of vultures...
Can tell you now if I had reporters knocking on my door I wouldn't have been as polite as James May was. 
@SquadUp_ see you there <FISTED HAND SIGN>
@fuckoffcoldplay @Sn00pDean HAHAHAHA shit, that's really bad actually
@fuckoffcoldplay @Sn00pDean they look pretty meaty, it might just be the fur though... only one way to find out! <SMIRKING FACE>
@fuckoffcoldplay @Sn00pDean fair point, still bun pandas
@fuckoffcoldplay @Sn00pDean jesus wept. Who would want to rent a fucking panda
@fuckoffcoldplay @Sn00pDean pandas are literally the shittest animal, I'd definitely have beef with the govt if I lived there
@Sn00pDean I have no idea, I highly doubt it though! I imagine (or hope) that they at least have a list of protected species
@fuckoffcoldplay @Sn00pDean my only defence would be "well you were warned in my Twitter bio"... Actually, isn't Twitter banned there?!
@Sn00pDean like if I lived in China I could walk up to an animal in the street and kick the shit out of it, legally, which just isn't right
@Sn00pDean self defence is a different matter ofc, but I feel laws should be in place so that people who openly abuse animals get punished
The fact that China has no animal cruelty laws saddens me deeply
Got my Shikari Bristol tickets, ayyyy <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Y Not line-up is pretty decent this year!
@fuckoffcoldplay @Benem0th okay probably not thinking about it, you're welcome to my twatitis though
@Benem0th worth a shot haha, I'll let you know how it goes
@fuckoffcoldplay @Benem0th I wish I couldn't then I'd actually have motivation to not
@Benem0th I'll be asleep at my desk if I try that tomorrow! 2 in the morning and a Relentless in the afternoon could be doable though hmm
@Benem0th I hate it! Free coffee at my work plus a Sainsburys that's always stocked with Relentless 2 minutes walk away is a bad combo..
@Benem0th guess that's the best way of doing it! I'll give it a go tomorrow and try have less than the 7 caffeinated drinks I had today <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Nut even
This being exhausted throughout the day then pretty awake and not able to sleep at night business really is doing my fucking but in.
Need to cut caffeine out of my diet but it'll absolutely murder me in the short term, can't win
Just under 6 hours sleep if I fall asleep right now, what an absolute treat AS ALWAYS
That's gotta be why I've got a bangin headache right now surely
Shit, I drank 2 cans of Relentless, 4 cups of coffee and a Red Bull at work today...
All I know is I definitely prefer the way Stinson Hunter does it
Not sure what to make of this Shane Brannigan guy
Anyone hitting up Shikari in Bristol?!
@lady_smiler ah even better! Yeah that's a good point, better to get the word out early
@lady_smiler is it a weekday? (Not that it matters hugely cos it's more than worth booking a day off for)
Even in traffic. You should see the looks I get.
The Nights by Avicii is officially my new "shout at the top of my lungs on the way to work" song
@ambchanel it's such a bad feeling, I don't wanna not be a teenager ever
In exactly three months I'll be 20. TWENTY. Naaaaaaaah.
However, I do hope the people involved in the accident are all okay, it looked pretty nasty <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
I literally use it for one junction and I was sat there for about an hour and a half, unimpressed
I'm finally home, over an hour later than usual, bun the M3
The one thing worse than stop-start traffic is traffic that is just stop
This is SO long man
MOVE 
@lady_smiler official?! Yessss you legend
Literally can't even join it, nothing is moving at all.
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH THE M3 TODAY
I've not been this tired in a long time, 5 hours sleep two days in a row really doesn't cut it
Fuck off other cars my journey is more important
It took me half an hour to join the M3, what a joke
@dave_everett that country gets more and more appealing by the day!
I hope someone does a barbeque this Summer *cough @lady_smiler cough*
All I wanna do when the suns out is pop my sunglasses on, have a BBQ and consume copious amounts of beer
I hope today was an anomaly and the sunny weather we've been having makes another appearance
Did I really just spend nearly £20 on a book about Excel <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
I particularly like driving at the same speed as them in the next lane and doing it until they notice
Me in one picture 
@hysterhia <VICTORY HAND>
@ellanelson_ my middle name obvs (not really at all)
@ellanelson_ never again! Do appreciate you getting us in free though <WINKING FACE> I wanna go back soon, I love it
It's kinda worrying really considering I used to use them once in a blue moon
Since I've been talking to this girl my use of emojis via text has increased by at least 500%
@NicolaaaScott what the fuck, that's outrageous!
This is important 
Nice of Asda to send me my P45 2 months late when I've already endured phoning HMRC to sort my new tax code out
@Nekhanimal exactly <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> people are confusing sometimes.
@Nekhanimal you know! No one's forcing them to buy it, can't understand the fuss
@CRJG_ always <SMIRKING FACE>
@CRJG_ I found that promised TWY set list a couple of months ago too so if I haven't lost it again you can take that too haha!
@CRJG_ believe I still have your hat too which has been even longer!
@CRJG_ ah that's sick. We'll have to go for a drink or something soon, been too long!
Plus, to be fair, it's their newspaper and they have every right to put what they want on their front page???
@CRJG_ ah awesome! Take it that's easier travel wise?
Why do people get so angry about some celebrity trash being the front page over a more "serious" story? It's The Sun what do you expect?!
@CRJG_ cheers mate, really enjoying it actually! You still at Gatwick?
@CRJG_ work as an accounting apprentice for a finance company! Bit of a step up from my old job hahaha
It's lunchtime and I've already done everything I need to do at work today. #killem
Straight up, fuck that.
How can someone on Gogglebox be like "we used to drink our own piss for dares at uni", honestly think I'd rather cut my throat
Life's generally pretty good at the moment thinking about it, defo improvements to make though. Positive vibes <SMIRKING FACE>
My BMI is far better than it's ever been, very happy about this
@DyllanShikari all pays off in the end! Glad you're still enjoying it though!
@DyllanShikari such a good feeling! Think I'd honestly have lost my mind if I was still at my old job, jesus
This doesn't make the distinct lack of sleep that I'm gonna get okay though.
I do love having a job that I'm actually enjoying, getting out of bed for my old one was such a drag but now it's really easy
Genuinely think my most tweeted words must be "why am I still awake"
Why the fuck am I awake considering how little sleep I got last night
I feel like tomorrow should be a bank holiday
Going out on Saturdays is weird because you spend the whole Sunday being hungover then go straight back to work the next day
Brighton was cool, thanks again to @LivvyOnAPrayer for putting up with us!
@DyllanShikari the m3 is a nightmare at the moment to be fair, it confuses me and I only use it for 1 junction
@DyllanShikari oh dear <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@CrackTheCameron @LivvyOnAPrayer @MattTheHero "mate I've had one pint"
@DyllanShikari hahahaha bet that was nice, hope you saw all the sights such as absolutely nothing
@LivvyOnAPrayer @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero I'll try my best
@LivvyOnAPrayer @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero I'm gonna have to grab some beers or something as well otherwise I'll die haha
@DyllanShikari please! Also, still got your Mindsweep lol
@LivvyOnAPrayer @CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero I'm bringing the jaffa cake voddy
Particularly clothes shopping. Longest thing
I hate shopping
@CrackTheCameron @MattTheHero @LivvyOnAPrayer YES BEST GAME
<SMIRKING FACE> 
@CrackTheCameron 
When I was laughing because the garage forgot to charge me for taxing my car it was because they didn't actually tax it, oops
I think I need this in my life 
Challenge accepted though, it'll make me like 10x better at my job
Oh yeah I've gotta basically master Excel by the end of this month, bit long considering I only really know the basics
@_xomilly 2 years of him shaped us into the people we are today, big love
@_xomilly hahaha chill out David Dickinson! I sold a vinyl for £75 last week, only cost me £18 <FLEXED BICEPS>
@BleachBlood no, thank you! Can't see myself getting bored of this in a hurry, seriously good.
@_xomilly #hustlersinceday
@ellanelson_ @MattTheHero of course! Proper excited
Before I've only filled up like £25 every time in fear of overfilling, NOT ANYMORE BITCHES
I also discovered that the petrol pump cuts out when you've filled the whole tank. My mind was blown
So weird that @MattTheHero was following behind me for most of my drive home from work and I didn't notice until we both stopped for petrol!
So the new @BleachBlood album "All The Sides of a Circle" absolutely rules. Seriously recommend you all check it out!
As horrible as social media can be I think my last retweet shows it can also be brilliant

We are going to dance!!! 
@MattTheHero @LivvyOnAPrayer @CrackTheCameron cannot wait!
"It knocked him out but he needs to man up, it was only a left hook" #Woking
@hysterhia fully understand, it's the right thing to do
March soz
@hysterhia ha awkward, you've replied now so I can't even do a sneaky delete, fuck sake
They've changed the open date from end of 2013 to summer 2014 and now they reckon August 2015 hahahahaha what a shambles
The cinema that they've been building was originally supposed to open at the end of 2013, we're now in May 2015 and it's not fully built...
@tiffeerascal hahaha it'll be an antique or something!
@tiffeerascal yeah best to be safe. When I took my test someone turned up for theirs without it and they were told to go home, was awkward
@tiffeerascal ouch, that must hurt! I've literally never needed it since passing my test, not a clue where it could be haha
@tiffeerascal lost the actual license or the counterpart?!
I'm mainly happy about this because I have a feeling I've lost mine
Best news, bun the counterpart 
@samuelreeve it's still a brilliant album but the others are just that bit better for me!
@samuelreeve hahaha nah! I'm standing by it
Common Dreads &gt; AFFOC &gt; The Mindsweep &gt; TTTS #FightMe
I've given it much thought but here goes:
I've actually put on weight for the first time in over a year, yeeeee <SMIRKING FACE>
@BleachBlood @Holyfucked album arrived today, that's the soundtrack to my drive to work sorted for tomorrow! Cheers again guys
Ed Milliband has a special tone in his voice that he reserves exclusively for when he's parring David Cameron
I shut the till really quick and we couldn't open them again unless they bought something, they were fuming, it was great.
I remember getting a shitty customer when I worked at the cinema so I gave them a Scottish fiver as part of their change
@MattTheHero IV drip? #HowCanIOneUpThat
@MattTheHero fuck it just pop some red bull in the bottle and hand it over
@MattTheHero 10 jagerbombs is only two trips to the bar, her heart is a puss
Shouldn't really laugh at my last RT but fuck <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@Li0nheart__ it's awful! Over an hour waiting but I finally got through to someone
@Sn00pDean you know it
Over an hour on hold but my tax is finally all sorted, phew
I've now been on hold 45 minutes, do they only have one person working there or something?
I've been on hold to HMRC for 27 minutes
@thatkidboy the backrest is bigger but the seats are super thin hahaha! If you're sat next to someone you literally get no room
@thatkidboy they're smaller than the ones on the tube/metro/whatever you guys call it haha!
@thatkidboy hahahaha the train seats are really small! Plus I like my personal space <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
It's a busy train but I can see an empty two seater so I don't feel too bad about it
Shamelessly being "that guy" and hogging two seats on this train, I'm too tired to deal with being cramped in next to a stranger
@CRJG_ that one doesn't make sense to me, it's not like everyone flies their own personal planes! Yeah aside from transport I'm impressed
Other than their views on transport/roads I do find myself agreeing with the vast majority of what they say though so I guess I'll allow
Just had a flick through and they basically want to build roads that try and force people to drive slowly, v bad from a harm reduction view.
They have a harm-reduction policy with regards to drug law but they have the total opposite idea in motoring law
My main problem with the Green Party is the fact that if you drive a car they fucking hate you
If all my numbers came up on one of the few days that I'd forgotten to get a ticket I'd be very angry for a very long time
Everytime I forget to get a lottery ticket I prang the fuck out thinking "oh shit what if my numbers came up"
@TravisInTransit safe, let me know!
@TravisInTransit come Brighton!
@TravisInTransit ah shit, well I'll come see you tomorrow if you're around, if not I'll defo see you Friday!
@TravisInTransit you're kidding?! Ffs Travis
Those two things don't really go together but I'm sure it'll be a laugh
Brighton on Saturday though. I'm gonna get super drunk and try not to make an arse of myself
I always try and focus on the positives and ignore the negatives but I'm feeling pretty bummed out today
@fuckoffcoldplay oh lol reviewing, analysing and editing a rather large financial position report
@fuckoffcoldplay Accounting apprentice!
I don't even understand where I'm going wrong and it's so frustrating
Thank god it's only a once a month job (if you get it right and don't have to redo it)
I keep cocking up what is basically my main job at work and it's really stressing me out
If you ever feel like experiencing disappointment I'd recommend getting a breakfast from Greggs
"What's your tax code" "ill get it in a minute, just getting dressed x"
I'm gonna phone them tomorrow morning while I'm getting ready for work and they can deal with me being long to them
Fuck HMRC, taking over £100 from my pay then hanging up on me multiple times before I even got to speak to an actual person
"We can't deal with your call at the moment. Goodbye" I'll keep calling back until you do you little cunts
Why the fuck do HMRC hang up on you if they're busy, so fucking rude
@mahramore @MattTheHero fair point, it's still annoying haha
@MattTheHero I guess but she's the worst of a bad bunch
@MattTheHero Fearne "I Bumlick Celebrities Constantly" Cotton
The office is so quiet today, it's kinda eerie
Paid extra to eat in at Greggs, turn around and there's no tables left #par
NOW IM HUNGRY AS WELL AS TIRED FUCK OFF
If I get to Woking early I'm treating myself to a McDonald's breakfast
I'm so tired fucking hell
@TheLegendOfLeo thank you!
@DragonForza he's not exactly most deserving of the title haha
@TheShwinEscPlan definitely agree there, people hugely overplay it though I think!
I really don't buy into the idea that Kanye West is a "genius"
@amyhatton_ oops, sorry to get your hopes up! Haha
@mark_reddie you honestly couldn't pay me to go, sounds like a nightmare
@amyhatton_ nah I do one day a week at a tiny college in Guildford as part of my apprenticeship!
@amyhatton_ Aldershot's the deadest place. Hahaha I always walk past the Guildford one on my way to college!
@amyhatton_ is there a popworld in popworld? <WINKING FACE> think my nearest one is Aldershot!
@DyllanShikari good point. Remains one of the funniest nights out I've had haha!
@DyllanShikari still wouldn't happen, soz. Shit that's quite bad hahaha, surely worth it for £1 drinks though <WINKING FACE>
@DyllanShikari you've got no chance, I'd rather claw my eyes out. The only place I've nearly got into a fight at is Tru hahahaha
@DyllanShikari fuuuuck that
@amyhatton_ guess I'll never know hahahaha. It seems SO cringey!
@lady_smiler thank you, guess it'll have to wait until tomorrow!
Can't think of a worse way to spend a night, imagine the sorts of people you'd be surrounded by..
I'd rather have diarrhoea for a week than set foot in Popworld
Guarantee I phone them and I get a recorded message saying call back tomorrow
Anyone know what time HMRC are open til?
You know the Reading lineup is bad when the V Fest lineup is better...
Bun the beginning of the month if it's gonna be like this all the time
Today was stress
Wish I could sort my sleeping pattern out, causes me so much stress
I'm always exhausted late afternoon but come night I can never sleep
Chin up lads
I've just realised the garage I got my car from forgot to charge me for taxing it hahahaha
@idxntitycrisis not cool! It'll be a good payday when you do get it though haha
Is it too early to order my festival tent?
@beeethanymay that must have felt good haha! They owe me at least £100 and this is my first payday <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@idxntitycrisis fucking hell, wish they'd just get it right, it's happened every job I've had!
Wish you could just text them. "Alright mate, can you sort my tax out? Cheers x"
I've been taxed far too much but phoning HMRC is long
@ellibear_ those fucking 1s <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> that was not a good game hahaha
I haven't had a good game of Monopoly in far too long
Still haven't fully recovered from Friday night but I'm far better than I was yesterday
@dave_everett oh no, my heart bleeds for you haha. I definitely wouldn't mind winter if it was a 15 degree winter!
Makes me happy to be able to say winter's over for another year
I've only just discovered you're supposed to put a set amount of water in super noodles, I thought you just poured some into the pan...
@Tapmeasnoutjaan I'm so sly haha, did it at Shikari yesterday too for two total strangers!
It's such a sneaky, blew my mind when I learnt how
Being able to get someone from seated into standing at a show is one of my finest skills
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari yeah that in itself was a miracle haha
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari hahahahaha I deserve credit for not slicing my hand off though!
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari that's a bit of a par
@DyllanShikari @Tapmeasnoutjaan OH MY GOD YOUR NAME <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@DyllanShikari @Tapmeasnoutjaan 16 year old me once whiteyed off half a J at the start of a party and missed the whole thing <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
@DyllanShikari @Tapmeasnoutjaan that's too funny I'm sorry
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari I do wish I'd been there for that hahaha!
@DyllanShikari @Tapmeasnoutjaan #SnoopDyllan #DyllanKhalifa
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari yeeeeeee!!!!!!
@DyllanShikari the top black bit looks a bit gold but the rest is a faded looking black
@fuckoffcoldplay the top bit is a bit brown but the rest just looks like a faded black!
@DyllanShikari that's definitely more black than gold! (To be fair that looks brown to me)
@fuckoffcoldplay BROWN?! Naaah
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari stu knows
@DyllanShikari IN WHAT WORLD IS THIS WHITE 
For the record it's 100% blue and black
The dress debate was still going in the smoking area at Shikari last night
Gonna watch yesterdays Gogglebox, if the posh couple aren't on this one I'm gonna be fuming
@500daysofabi_ hahaha this is closer to my reaction than your other comment!
@500daysofabi_ they still follow me on here <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hannah Wants is though so that's good enough for me
Lethal Bizzle isn't playing the day of Reading that I wanna go to, peak times
Their light show was so intense though
Last night is such a blur, I thought the photos I was taking were great. They're all like this 
There was someone at Shikari last night who looked exactly like the singer from blood on the dancefloor hahahaha
Forgot I had a Relentless in my work bag, what a lifesaver
I'm so glad I had no commitments for today because they just wouldn't have got done
I'm not in a good way right now at all hahaha
Today is a write off already
I am so dead
@DyllanShikari I'm afraid they were
Shikari were great tonight
I am wasted
Buzz on for Shikari
They think I'm on it.... but they don't know
Take yourself mate, my directions were sick
I just gave someone directions, then they said "can you take me there", sorry do I look like a sat-nav?
@GreggstheBakers the staff in your Woking branch are always so lovely, just thought I'd say!
Not Solaris ffs SHIKARI
Solaris today!!!!
I am so confused
I've woke up to everyone banging on about dress, what the fuck?
Surely it doesn't take a genius to say "maybe we should spread these slightly more evenly"
They have 3 trains where I need to go all within 20 minutes of each other then none after that for another hour and a quarter
Things that can fuck off include First Great Western's stupid timetables and the walk home from Blackwater station
@Sleazyweasleys yes! My favourite band in my favourite venue, doesn't really get much better than that aha!
@Sleazyweasleys see you there! So excited hahaha
SHIKARI TOMORROW YES LADS
@Unrest_ good luck with both! <FISTED HAND SIGN>
Whatever film was just on BBC 1 was so deep
The nicest thing in Farnborough is that arch. It's actually huge
<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
@fuckoffcoldplay oh my god hahaha that's another level! I always mute the machine too so it doesn't dob me in to the attendant
@fuckoffcoldplay MATE I ALWAYS DO THIS! I tried 9 once and it said it was too many
@fuckoffcoldplay the internal devastation of realising on the way out is too much for me
@fromthestrange there's literally 9 bands I'd see hahaha, so disappointing! Yeah I've heard that said a lot to be fair, can't wait!
@fromthestrange that's impressive haha! I'm usually all about Reading but the line-up sucks this year, will be nice to do a different fest!
Nothing worse than forgetting to swipe your nectar card at Sainsburys
@fromthestrange ah awesome! All should be well then, so excited for it! Do you know how fast it usually sells out? Haven't got a ticket yet
@fromthestrange ah that's good to hear! Do they let you leave the site (like to go to the shop/car park) and come back in?
I've not had a decent sleeping pattern since like year 10
Up at 7 for work, can I sleep? No of course not
Fucking Scotland man
I've been doing some light reading and security at TITP seems to be a lot tighter than most festivals
Worst station
Bun off I can deal with a second of poor quality but don't turn Radio 1 off and replace it with BBC Surrey
The radio in my car does this really annoying thing where if it starts to lose signal even slightly it'll switch to another radio station
@MattDrakere you know! Was fuming, so glad she got put in her place hahaha
@RobL94 a vinyl haha!
Not bad at all if I do say so myself
I paid £17.99 for something that I've just sold on ebay for £70
@DyllanShikari hahaha I expect it to be like Reading except you can't understand what anyone's saying
@DyllanShikari okay that's not too bad! Well excited already hahaha
@DyllanShikari I'm holding you to this, when do you think it'll be?!
@ellanelson_ this is my exact dilemma!
@ellanelson_ do ittt! I can't see any line-up beating it, I'm literally sold
@ellanelson_ come!! I know a couple of people who wanna but I'm not gonna risk booking it yet hahaha
Downloads atmosphere is nowhere near as good hahaha, full of people trying to out-metal each other, zzzzzz
Why do people say they hate Readings atmosphere? It's got the best atmosphere of any festival I've been to by a country mile
Bun having people bail and trekking to Scotland on my own hahaha
Defo T in the Park for me this year, I'm ready to book my ticket I just need someone to book theirs too
@Beez_says if Knife Party are closing surely you can catch both?!
Lethal Bizzle though, that'd be cool <SMIRKING FACE>
There's not even one headliner I'd see which sucks so bad
Meh/10, I can still count the number of bands I wanna see on my hands
Hold up apparently I'm missing a Reading announcement, shit
@RobL94 I've got autocorrect to blame for that one at least
@RobL94 Fuck sake knew someone would catch me out
I'm a big fan of The Nights by Avicii, such a jam
Buzzfeed should rename themselves BenedictCumberbatchFeed
@ConkQuitTheBand king of cheeky
Radio 1s Nerd Alert is the best thing to happen to my Tuesday
@fuckoffcoldplay it's so good!
Big Hero Six won best animation, very well deserved

#desperate
@ConkQuitTheBand use roadblock but you've gotta switch it on and off when the ads start and finish
Why am I so awake when I've gotta be up for work at 7
Last time I went out in Brighton we didn't make it to a proper club due to high intoxication levels, oops
So Shikari/maybe clubbing this weekend and going out in Brighton next weekend, not too shabby
I know how to block your ads fuck you @4od
@Sn00pDean oh fucking hell hahahaha do you reckon he actually believes half the shit he comes out with
@Sn00pDean what a surprise!
@Sn00pDean gonna be Andy aint it, he chats so much shit haha
@Sn00pDean evolution is fact loooool which one was it?
Shot her my biggest <SMIRKING FACE> face every time I went out, because I'm a gloating little cunt
Then we got her manager out and they were like "that's not a rule, let them go outside" #par
Remember when Shikari played Dorking and the security woman was like "you can't go for a smoke without being 18+ and having your ID"
I apologise in advance to anyone who sees me on Friday, you have been warned
@fuckoffcoldplay see you in the pit for Fix You
@fuckoffcoldplay I heard they're headlining the Sunday with Coldplay subbing them
Reading announcement tomorrow including the third headliner, this is literally make or break for me, they need to pull something special out
@DaanFoShizzle I hope so! Still not nice to feel like your driving's being spied on hahaha
@itsjamierawr I've already done that on this policy, there's no fines or anything so I just ignore the fact the box is there haha!
@itsjamierawr yeah I'm definitely not having one for my second year haha, as long as it makes it cheaper I can't complain!
@itsjamierawr damn insurance company haha
Needless to say I'm not enthusiastic about the idea, I guess it makes the insurance bare cheaper though so I can't complain too much
Currently having a big brother box fitted to my car <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
He must have known what he did cos he disappeared pretty quickly after
Some dangerous fuck majority cut me up to then find we work in the same building
@tiffeerascal probably for the best <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@tiffeerascal hahahaha no way?! That's unbelievable aha
@tiffeerascal great episode but where the fuck were the posh couple?! They're the best ones!
Shit didn't Gogglebox start on Friday?! I need to catch up
Just heard Fire Burning by Sean Kingston for the first time in years, what a banger
I don't think I'll forgive myself if I'm not at T in the Park this year
Defo feeling an early night tonight
I've been exhausted all day, woke up at 2 and I've done nothing productive since
@ellanelson_ please do!
@ellanelson_ mad!! See you both there haha
@ellanelson_ are you actually?!
@nigativity see you there!! Should be a good one haha
Shikari on Friday, yeeee boy
I know which I'd prefer to watch
Rather than cutting someones hair off for a "prank" why not do a funny one such as this: 
@DyllanShikari sweet, let me know when you can!
@DyllanShikari if we can get tickets I'll book it off, yolo
@MattTheHero shit! Hope everyone's alright :(
@DyllanShikari I probably will to be honest, can't miss this hahahaha
@MattTheHero is this what the whole of my Facebook is talking about?! Shiiiiit
@DyllanShikari I'm gonna see what I can do, £1 drinks and the chuckle brothers is selling me
@DyllanShikari very tempted haha, if it was on a weekend I'd be straight on it
@DyllanShikari that's naughty!
@DyllanShikari not a clue, don't know if it's been announced!
@DyllanShikari bearer of bad news :( There's always Chuckle Brothers I guess!!!!!! Although I reckon 90% of the people there would be knobs
@DyllanShikari 
@DyllanShikari my tweet was because of them saying "lol it sold out in 12 minutes", if I'd known I well would have! :(
@DyllanShikari I haven't had my phone on me all day lol, isn't it sold out?!
Radio 1 was on point from like 6-7pm, all the dance jams to drive home to
Why did no one tell me Snoop Dogg was playing Switch.....
If you wear real fur from any animal you are a cunt, straight up.
@RobL94 to be honest I'll take that over the alternative hahahaha
@RobL94 it was sat there for over 11 hours in a v visible place and no one took it! It's not even a nice area I dropped it in, I'm shocked
@Unrest_ yeah it was just sat on the floor, I'm shocked! Well that's just shit.
@Unrest_ you should phone the bus company if you haven't already though, long shot but can't hurt!
@Unrest_ peak :( mine was on the street opposite mine, it's been there since I left for work at 8am! Can't believe it
@Unrest_ not good! If you haven't found it yet best of luck, I'll keep my fingers crossed for ya
Talk about lucky, I honestly feel blessed right now
Fucking hell I found my phone, dropped it on the road opposite mine, so it's been there since I left for work at 8am
I've had it a week, I'm so annoyed
Guess who's lost their phone.
Going clubbing after the show could be on the cards wahey
Why is the Shikari after party 2am curfew, means I'd have to wait aaaages to get a morning train home
@DyllanShikari genuinely up for that!
@Tapmeasnoutjaan minus the chav part that sounds brilliant hahaha
@Tapmeasnoutjaan what's that?! Heard good things about the festival though to be fair
@Tapmeasnoutjaan lad! Cheers man, if I can round up the crew I'm defo there!
@ellanelson_ they're taking the lead this year for sure!
Straight up, who wants to come T in the Park?! I'm so game
I've never been swayed by T before but that's the best weekend festival lineup I've seen this year, I'm sold
Oh my days the T in the Park lineup is mad!
Fucking hate trains so much, so unreliable
What happened to the 15:34 from Guildford to Farnborough North @FGW
Every cloud has a silver lining: my train ticket cost me £3 less cos this one's off peak
Still gonna be an hour late <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
If you know me you'll know I've never done that before
Completely forgot to set an alarm for today, I had to wake up, get ready and leave in 15 minutes to make this train
Just me or does it feel much later than it is?
My eyesight is so bad compared to what it used to be
@ABenToRemember ah nice! That could create a good atmosphere to be fair
Royal Blood came on the radio and the song was actually quite jammy, I should probably check them out
Probably helped that I didn't take a wrong turn this time
Left later for work, arrived earlier. Not complaining!
Might do the ol' turn off 3g and pretend my phone played up trick
When a conversation isn't coming to a good end but you wanna go to bed
Why the fuck am I awake
@DyllanShikari best of luck! I'm sure you'll smash it
@DyllanShikari <FLEXED BICEPS><FLEXED BICEPS><FLEXED BICEPS>
@imamassivesheep peak, guess it'll have to do until my contract runs out haha
My mum forgot to buy pancake stuff, goodbye my day is ruined
@imamassivesheep I only get 500mb data a month and I worry it'll get riiinsed doing that though
Sat nav always tells me to turn left at a road where no left turns are allowed, fuck off?
@_xomilly yeah hahaha, what the actual fuck
Does horseracing involve deliberately stabbing an animal for a long period of time causing it a slow and painful death? Psshhh
My tutor at my old school, who happened to be Spanish, once tried to defend bullfighting by saying "it's no worse than horseracing".. WHAT?!
@DyllanShikari you do realise we're not both actually gonna drive right? <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@DyllanShikari you've got me there haha!
@DyllanShikari guess we'll have to race ;) ah that's peak!
@DyllanShikari me and Cameron are gonna drive a car each #banter #convoy #fucktheenvironment
@DyllanShikari apparently there's none at common people though so we'd have to find another route there :(
@DyllanShikari so far it's literally me and Cameron but yeah well up for that! Considering driving up if there's parking at yours?
@DyllanShikari oh god yes! And we'll be able to stay until close this time hahahaha
@DyllanShikari good decision!
@DyllanShikari please do! Can't leave me and Cameron to hack the sesh alone
Anyone hitting up Common People in May? You'd be a fool to miss out on Fatboy Slim and Jaguar Skills, just sayin
"Repost if you're against *thing that 99.99% of people are against*" posts really annoy me
I'm gonna eat ALL the pancakes tomorrow
GUYS 
Today's been a good day.
@BleachBlood @Holyfucked mad! Thanks guys, very happy right now! x

@16_Beasley_St 
AND
@liamshikari

BUT WAIT IF YO…


@lady_smiler hahaha oh shit! Well the main thing is you made it home in one piece <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Observing my car via the window like every 10 minutes <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@_xomilly I have a heart... somewhere
@_xomilly nah I was a dick to the manager but nice to him haha
New car is an absolute dream to drive <AUTOMOBILE><AUTOMOBILE><AUTOMOBILE>
He seemed really sad bless him
The salesman didn't return my call Saturday because his wife miscarried, he's fully excused on that one
"Can you do your own sandwiches tomorrow Liam?" "But they don't taste as nice when I do them" "oh fine I'll do them now" Mum knows the score
Haven't been able to drive properly for ages, this is gonna be nice
I'm a bit excited ya know
New car tomorrow new car tomorrow new car tomorrow <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><DANCER><SMIRKING FACE>
I'd buy the shit out of that
The makers of Capri Sun are missing a trick by not selling a bottled version
@DyllanShikari <WAVING HAND SIGN>
@DyllanShikari worst song
Uptown Bun
I saw Big Hero Six yesterday and it was actually pretty decent
Thought I'd got away with it as no one mentioned it on the phone
Insurance were straight on my case phoning me about getting a new black box fitted <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
Had some good times in that car
I'm gonna be so sad driving my little Corsa to its deathbed tomorrow
"You can have it tomorrow... Oh you'll be at work" yeah cheers dad
My Dad came up to me as I was making a toasty and said "oh you could have had spaghetti carbonara for lunch" NOW YOU FUCKING TELL ME
@fuckoffcoldplay @LemonyMidget I'll never forget how fucking painful that was
Me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@lady_smiler your poor feet :( no problem at all
@lady_smiler if I had my new car when I was supposed to I would have, hope you find a way back!
@ellanelson_ never tried it, I'd probably like it though for real!
Name a green veg other than spinach and I can almost guarantee I like it but FUCK spinach
The texture of spinach creeps me out
If the engine light wasn't on I'd wake up early and rag it around until the fuel was gone, cunts don't deserve the 1/4 tank that's left
I've left all of the rubbish I found in my car in the boot, don't give me shit service if you don't want a minor inconvenience in return :)
@coldguinness_ Corsa Sxi, 1.2 5dr
Taking my old car in as part exchange but first I'm taking out absolutely everything extra such as the spare wheel cos they don't deserve it
My mum on the salesman: "cheeky little cunt" - you can see where I get it from
(It shouldn't have taken my whole fkin Saturday to find out though) (but I'm happy)
Finance got accepted, collecting the car Monday morning, yaasss!
@coldguinness_ deposits already down or I would, i just flipped my shit at the manager and he's promised me a call in the next half hour <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>
If I hadn't already put the deposit down I'd have told them where to go a long time ago, what a joke.
You'd think spending a lot of money at a reputable garage you'd get good service but apparently fucking not, I'm so angry
"Hi I've been waiting for a call back from Adam for about 2 hours, am I gonna get it please?" "Oh he's just left" WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
If I knew they were gonna be this fucking useless I'd have gone somewhere else, they've taken the piss for the entire process
@LiamShikari oh look I was right
Guess what, still haven't had a call back! How can your customer service be this bad fucking seriously?!
I've been nothing but polite throughout, if I don't get one within the next hour I'm gonna go mad
45 minutes, no callback
Thinking about it their customer service has actually been well shit throughout
The garage are gonna long out my call back again I can just tell
@hysterhia @TheOneTruePablo yaaaaay this is good! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Found out I get paid slightly more than I thought I did which is always nice
@hysterhia @TheOneTruePablo yes to both
So glad it's Friday
@TheOneTruePablo Corsa Sxi provided the finance gets accepted!
@briefcasem0ng @Sn00pDean nope, miss u 2 tho
@DyllanShikari nah I always question if I'm actually taking a proper toke or not then usually end up overtoking on the next one
@DyllanShikari LIFE
@briefcasem0ng @Sn00pDean #nah
@Sn00pDean oh shit I forgot they exist, I haven't had them in long! I can't even think where I'd rank them
@Sn00pDean haven't bought a tub since, it's all about Heroes anyway!
@Sn00pDean mate they got rid of them, they were literally the best ones though! Replaced with Twix now :(
@Sn00pDean I'll eat them if I'm desperate but yeah they're pretty nasty
@Sn00pDean they're in celebrations mate, but yeah they're definitely the last to go hahaha!
@d3athrattle 100% the correct order
I still have so many Quality Street left over from Christmas but it's only the batty ones left cause I ate all the nice ones
Heroes &gt; Celebrations &gt; Quality Street
@coldguinness_ oh right haha, I had a little test drive and all went well so (hopefully) it'll all be fine
@coldguinness_ oh shit I completely forgot, sorry! Do appreciate the offer though!
The first journey I have to do is to Woking literally the second I pick it up, that should be a laugh
Which is a tad annoying cos I was told I can have it Saturday
Okay so if I get approved for the finance I collect my car at 8am Monday <SMIRKING FACE>
@TheOneTruePablo that would have been very handy yes
My poor mother is sat in the car waiting while you sit there firing questions at this man, get out get out get out
WHY ARE YO U BUYING SOMEONE A NEW CAR THAT HASNT PASSED THEIR TEST
HE HASNT EVEN PASSED HIS TEST, MY GOD PLEASE GET OUT
Stop questioning everything you're holding me up, go home and read the fucking contract
Giving the salesman shit because it's taking a while when he's literally running around, fuck off you old cunt
This guy's dad in the garage is a right prick
It's beyond unacceptable, genuinely makes me feel ill.
There's not a lot that makes me feel more sick than "care home abuse" cases


Full lineup at 
Tickets on sale 9am Frid…
Underworld at Bestival, madness
Don't think I've ever shat it that hard
Websites with sneaky videos that autoplay with sound when you have your volume on max can fuck off
If l like it (which I already know I do) I'll have it by Saturday <SMIRKING FACE>
Going to look at a car tonight <SMIRKING FACE>
@DyllanShikari it can only end well surely!
@DyllanShikari mate imagine the banter
An excuse to go clubbing PLUS being in the same room as Paul &amp; Barry Chuckle, where do I sign up for that?!
OH MY GOD MY LAST RETWEET

More information coming soon... 
@hysterhia yeah fair but if I rang them I'd be speaking to someone within 60 seconds so they need to sort it out a bit haha!
@TravisInTransit give him 10 mate *doesn't call back*
@hysterhia I'll give it a bit longer then ring them, 40+ minutes is not "shortly" ffs
I've been waiting for a call back from this garage for half an hour, their definition of "shortly" must be different to mine
Is it a rule that to work in the motoring industry you have to be long about everything
Parklife line-up is naughty, anyone game?
@CRJG_ oh shit hahaha that makes more sense! That was the funniest thing
@fuckoffcoldplay @CRJG_ best day
@CRJG_ where you heading to? #coachbanter
@divyagill_ I was gonna but everyone was rushing off the train at the time haha! Next time
@divyagill_ definitely just saw you at the station!
That was awful I'm sorry, point still stands though
You can't keep selling merch a year after your demise!
Even though Your Demise split up like a year ago they're still on my Facebook like "buy our merch"
Dress down Fridays are a thing at work, reckon I'd get away with pyjamas and a dressing gown?
@coldguinness_ oooh nice! Ill get back to you on that, cheers
@coldguinness_ seems to be endless benefits to it to be honest! I'll have a good think but I'm probably gonna go for it
@hysterhia always
@hysterhia allow yourself
@fuckoffcoldplay so game for this, you'll have to allow me some time getting used to driving it though, I refuse to crash this one haha
@hysterhia Corsa SXi <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
@Markkisonfire definitely will do man!
@hysterhia the offer I've clocked is 5 year only, gotta decide by the end of the month!
@Markkisonfire finance on a 13-plate Corsa SXi is a really good price at a garage nearish me, I'm very tempted
Probably gonna go for it. I'll sleep on it first
I can well afford it, I'll have a reliable car but do I wanna be tied to it for 5 years hmmmm
Contemplating getting a car on finance, decisions decisions
@sw_trains I hope you're refunding my train ticket considering I've been at the station for over an hour.
@CRJG_ @MattTheHero I see! I've got like £600 at my disposal if I budget hard for the rest of this month
I'm fucking starving you absolute cunts @SW_Trains
My trains here, now they're deciding to wait here until the NEXT train is due so they can say that one left on time. Fuck you @SW_Trains
@MattTheHero @CRJG_ I have no idea what any of that means
@CRJG_ @MattTheHero I'm thinking that too, but it'll mean that I can get a car much quicker. Tricky one really
No train until at least 19:35, fucking fuming
@MattTheHero in all seriousness, get a new car I guess, maybe make insurance give me some £ for the old one
@MattTheHero kill myself
FFS AN ANNOUNCEMENT JUST SAID IT COULD BE UP TO AN HOUR. ACTUALLY FUCK OFF.
My train is delayed, not for a specific amount of time, just "delayed"
@MattTheHero what a dick!
@MattTheHero weeping. Did you get a car sorted in the end?
RIP trusty Corsa, gonna have to get a new car ain't I
Fuck sake WHY
Cars gonna cost £830 to fix which is more than I paid for it, gonna cry
I bought extra data this month and I've already nearly used it all, nah
One downside of my job is having to be awake at shit o'clock
@DyllanShikari I'm pinching the phrase "shit o'clock"
@r0adsick I wish I could say I wasn't hahaha
@r0adsick the shame <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE> I literally have no defence, that's the worst part!
@r0adsick oh my god this was like five years ago!!!! Hahaha did make me chuckle though
I'm gonna do something I probably shouldn't this weekend all in the name of fun
They were the shit, I've got such a craving for them right now
Remember those Campino sweets you used to get as a kid?!
@roby_nne blasphemy!
"I prefer 7-Up to Sprite" - no one
Now that I'm used to my new phone it's actually cool as shit
I'm not convinced my brain has absorbed everything hahaha
Today was busy to say the least
Defo getting a McDonald's breakfast before work
Whatever festival I do this year I hope Basement Jaxx are there
If I have to get the train to work all week I may actually cry
I find out exactly how fucked the engine for my car is either tomorrow/Tuesday, I'm hoping not too fucked
I guess that's what happens when you find a job that you like!
Never thought I'd see the day when I'd be excited to go to work yet here we are
@ambchanel wow who would honestly give a fuck
@Tapmeasnoutjaan pahaha see that's the way to do it! None of this weak shit
If you're gonna subject me to "10 things I don't know about you" how about making them more interesting than "my favourite colour is blue"
Ends today at 9pm

#DL2015 ht…
Annie Mac in Southampton is ridiculously tempting
Garage won't answer their phone, for fuck sake
@sammccrory_ glad I'm not the only one haha!
I've been exhausted all day yet now that I'm in bed can I sleep? Nope
I'm enjoying my new phone but navigating on it is a pain in the arse
I really hope the garage can sort my engine out tomorrow, seriously can't be fucked to get a train to work all week again
@DyllanShikari that was glorious
Squad 
My new sim card arrived, now to wait for my number to be transferred so I can use my new phone!
Definitely want to go back to Oceana in the near future, such a good night
Absolutely crazy night
£1 drinks in Ocena last night was absolutely lethal
@iamcolly_ has a lineup been released yet? I need to start thinking about what fest I'll do if Reading remains dire haha
Also regarding the story; I can see the point she's trying to make and I would agree with her
I've spotted four spelling/grammar mistakes in this article, do people at The Mirror not proofread? 
I don't think I have thankfully
Fell asleep on the train, now I'm not sure if I've missed my stop or not
@ConkQuitTheBand @MattTheHero train now!
@MattTheHero sick, I'll give you like an hour warning nearer the time! (You've just ruined the nap I planned to have)
@MattTheHero like 5/5:30?
Saturday night I'm gonna treat myself to a massive lie in, I've got so much sleep to catch up on
@MattTheHero yeah that's gonna suck, hopefully you can get it fixed quick
@MattTheHero if the engine light hadn't come on on my car I'd offer to drive but can't risk it really
@MattTheHero bollocks, that's not good at all
@MattTheHero uh oh, how bad?
How fucking insane is the Wireless lineup seriously!
It's so funny watching people look angry at level crossings when you're on the train that's making them stop
The best street name 
That should help me fix my car and get royally battered tonight
Got paid from my old job today, dollar dollar dollar
@_xomilly anywhere I go I make da gang go
@_xomilly hahahaha wish I could experience it
@_xomilly you know! Rari workouts gotta be his biggest tune
@_xomilly camo snapback rambo
@_xomilly you man are bankrupt, FAZER
@_xomilly such a tune hahahaha
@hysterhia they're fucking adorable
@ConkQuitTheBand yeah I'll be game
@ConkQuitTheBand not that I know of, apparently there's a pub that does a mad fry up
@ConkQuitTheBand nah I wouldn't be able to hack it, too old for that hahaha
@ConkQuitTheBand safe, tbh I'll definitely want to sleep in my own bed Saturday night haha
@ConkQuitTheBand standard! I hear you might be getting the train back Saturday, if so I'll tag along
@ConkQuitTheBand taxi of Matt, you?
@ConkQuitTheBand I'm buzzing for it!
Why do people say retail staff hate it when you say "have a good day"? I found it really nice when I worked in retail
Speaking of being mugged off... My train ticket to Woking costs £8.80 and it's the SECOND stop on a 15 minute train. Fuck you @SW_Trains
I have a feeling I got mugged off though because 40 paper clips shouldn't cost £3, that's ludicrous
A pack of paper clips cost me £3 from WHSmiths earlier today, I can't tell if I got mugged off or not as it's not a regular purchase for me
Ends 8/2/15 @ 9pm
T&amp;C's 
#DL2015 ht…
@DyllanShikari hype!!!!
@DyllanShikari if this means you're coming I'll allow
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari that was just a ridiculous night
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari I didn't have a drop of alcohol that night haha
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari I need to try it still!
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari you're not missing out
@Tapmeasnoutjaan @DyllanShikari that's too much for me to comprehend, how can you have a Guinness so ridiculously early!
@DyllanShikari @coldguinness_ time isn't relative in airports, that and festivals are the few exceptions
@coldguinness_ far too early to be doing that in public! Haha
Southampton tomorrow, buzz buzz buzz
5 minutes late to college but my teacher isn't even here yet so I guess that's fine
It's not even 9 and there's a man drinking Guinness on this train
If this snow fucks with my train I will be irritated
@_adamjames literally don't have a clue! It's for a mates birthday so wherever he wants to go really haha
The fact that I'm not asleep when I have to be on a train in less than 7 hours is disgusting
Can't wait to hit up Southampton on Friday night, I've heard good things
@DyllanShikari they had one 7/10 song but otherwise you're right haha
IF YOU WANNA COME BACK IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT IT'S ALRIGHT
Aren't they that band that had that one song and haven't done anything notable since?
Also The Vaccines subbing on the Sunday hahahaha not even a chance, nowhere near big enough
That Reading lineup floating around can't be legit, if The Prodigy were there they're defo a headline act?
@DyllanShikari this is good news!
@DyllanShikari how's the health situation going?
My phone case came with a screen protector which I will inevitably try to put on, get air bubbles caught in it then put it in the bin
A few highlights for you all 
Cracking up on the train at these fancy dog memes that just popped up on my Facebook, probably attracted some strange looks...
If someone wasn't home to sign for my bag and phone case I'll be annoyed, sorting centre is long for man
@MattTheHero how did we tweet basically the same thing within a second of each other
@dave_everett that's crazy! I'm actually really jealous haha
The Slam Dunk lineup is actually decent and I haven't said that for like 3 years
@dave_everett Soundwave always has such a good lineup, I'd definitely go if I was there!
@dave_everett yeah that's true actually, I'm still hoping the lineup will shape up a bit because I'd like to go
My phone case and new bag arrive today, result
@dave_everett ah fair enough, if I do end up going to Reading I really don't think I'll bother haha
@_xomilly :)))))))))))))
@_xomilly you're gay as fuck
@_xomilly why have you retweeted that u batty
@_xomilly I have no idea, they're so shit
I'm gonna OD on caffeine
I've just clocked the Nespresso machine in the office, this just gets better
@StudyAAT I'd say just make sure you prepare answers to interview questions and be enthusiastic!
@dave_everett they're just the worst!
@ConkQuitTheBand innit, I'm not sold at all so far
Case for my new phone has dispatched, sweeeet
I bought a 2 pack of shirts and one is significantly smaller than the other one, how does that work?
Taking a phone call via the microphone in your headphones is only acceptable if you're holding your phone
Is there anything better in the mornings than a McDonalds breakfast, I think not
If there's a queue for the ticket machine behind you, don't wait for your receipts. Cock.
The Wireless lineup this year is already better than Reading, how has that been allowed to happen
Hope I make the earlier train cos I'm fucking starving
Oh and Deadmau5 would be cool, but literally nothing else
FUCK SAKE I WANNA GO PLEASE SORT THE LINEUP OUT
So basically the Reading announcement was wank again apart from Hannah Wants and Chase &amp; Status, sound
@wishfuIthinkng sweeet thank you!
Anyone know what time the Reading announcement is?
First day done, really enjoyed it
@coldguinness_ that's good to hear! Best of luck with it
@StudyAAT a course with AAT actually! Looking forward to it
I've got so much to learn for this new job but working in an office is so chill, early days but I'm liking it already
This place is so fancy
@_xomilly I ask myself this question daily
My new phone arrived yesterday but dickhead here forgot to get a case for it and I can't trust myself not to drop it
@suicideseasam happy birthday! Have a good one
Must be said wearing a suit to work just feels... right.
I missed the earlier train meaning that whilst I'll still be on time to work I won't have time for a McDonalds breakfast, dammit
Suppose I should sleep as I'm up at 7
I start my new job tomorrow, excited doesn't cover it
@ConkQuitTheBand yeah hope so! Internet's playing up on this one so at least that'll be working haha
@ConkQuitTheBand look it up, it went down from £399 to £99 for a one day sale, now it's back up again haha
@ConkQuitTheBand amazon fire phone!
Gonna abuse the shit out of the Mayday button and make them do all the work for me rather than reading the instructions
My new phone's gonna be here on Monday, siiiik
@_xomilly @CameronTomorrow @TravisInTransit sf
@_xomilly @CameronTomorrow @TravisInTransit next time
@_xomilly @CameronTomorrow @TravisInTransit I'm so disappointed in myself
"Liam can you stay on today?" On my second to last day lol why the fuck would I do that
I've never driven in snow before, this could be fun...
@TravisInTransit I guess I'll find out in about 10 minutes!
@imamassivesheep #banterLAD #shittychestLAD
I've only ever had 2 McRibs, both while wasted, however I rate them
"@McDonaldsUK: When you realise the McRib is leaving soon. 
@imamassivesheep straight up not worth it, some people are wrong'uns
I'm literally horrified I was expecting a light hearted funny video but what I saw should not be seen
Has anyone else seen that video going round Facebook of a guy giving someone £300 then curling out a shit onto his chest. I was eating.
@SharanGilll ah damn, if I'd been paying more attention I would have done too haha! I'm glad I got off as it filled up tbh
@SharanGilll yes haha! I probably looked really moody cause the platform was swamped, I didn't see you!
It doesn't help that it's literally me, him and one other person in my class
One of the guys in my class went for the same interview I did, there was only one vacancy and I got it, this is so awkward
Maccys breakfast or no maccys breakfast, toughest decision I'll make all day
Actually Camberley's probably a bit shitter than Guildford
Woking and Guildford have to be the two worst places in Surrey
That's easily a 40-45 minute walk
How have I walked from my house to Farnborough North in 20 minutes
@DyllanShikari preach!
white ppl: here comes my child daffodil ginseng blueberry yogurt
@SharanGilll hahahaha it's honestly so tempting!
@SharanGilll it's disgraceful, might pop into sixth just to give him the finger
@DyllanShikari love it haha, fuck negative people
@coldguinness_ that's absolutely classic! Always nice to prove someone wrong haha
Wonder if he has Facebook, I want to add him and rub his smug cunty face in it
"You won't get an apprenticeship with that grade" think I will, prick
Look who's, y'know, GETTING SOMEWHERE WITH ACCOUNTANCY.
Massive fuck you to my A-Level Accounting teacher who said I'd never get anywhere with Accountancy because of the grade I got
I'm the only one on this bus and the driver's absolutely steaming along, g'warn lad!
Someone nearly took me out with their shopping trolley while I was carrying a cup of hot chocolate, that could have ended badly
@Mum4_20 I'm so happy. That's my exact thought, exciting times! Thanks again <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@Mum4_20 thank you very much! Very excited for it haha
Lethal Bizzle gets some shady people commenting on his instagrams 
@_xomilly #BigReunion
@_xomilly my course should finish at 5 but it was earlier last time, I'll give you a ring when I know
@_xomilly thanks pal! I'm in G'Town tomorrow, come say hi
Today is a good day
I'm stoked to start my new job
I'm stoked for Common People
@MattTheHero better ;) it's same role but for a finance company rather than an IT one
@_xomilly Accounting apprenticeship for a finance company! Buzzin
@lady_smiler thank you! So chuffed haha
@MattTheHero so stoked!!!
@CRJG_ at least they get a couple days notice this way haha!
@CRJG_ I'm gonna let em know and offer to still do the weekend, if they don't like it then gutted ;)
@hysterhia thank you! I'm SO stoked
I've gotta quit my current job without giving notice though, oops yolo
@DyllanShikari MATE <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><DANCER><OK HAND SIGN>
KILL'EM
MAAAAAAAAAATE WHAT THE FUCK
MATE I GOT THE JOB THAT'S SO KILLER
It's exactly the role that I want as well, fingers couldn't be any more crossed
I think that interview went really well, I'm so happy
If there's one thing I hate more than running for trains it's running and then missing said train
I'll still get there on time, lucky I got here early
Forgot how slow my mum drives, had to run for my train and missed it
@coldguinness_ thank you, I really hope so!
Definitely time for sleep
I got home from work at 9:15, from then until now I've been preparing for my interview tomorrow, really hoping this pays off
Cost £99, down from £399 for today only, rude not to really!
Just ordered an Amazon Fire phone yolo
Considering I have to prep for an interview tomorrow if they're not here by 9 they're not getting their shit
Why would you allow an order for 8-10pm if I finish at 9...
@sleepwxlkerr MY FAVOURITE FUCKING MUSIC
I think the February Reading announcement is make or break for me. I wanna go because it's good banter but the lineup needs to fill out
As if they're making a Ted 2 when the first one was so disappointing
Why the fuck am I still up
In other news Mincecraft for Xbox is mad cool, I can see why my little brother does nothing except sit in his room rinsing it
I'm gonna play it safe and walk I think
Googled it and apparently it's just a light to say service is due but that doesn't explain the engine making a weird noise...
Guess I'm walking to work tomorrow then.
A warning light came on on my way home and the engine was making a funny noise when I switched the car off. Brilliant.
The Aldi bear advert is brilliant
@lady_smiler @DyllanShikari I hope so!
Have you ever noticed 90% of the time on The Chase they get the Chaser that they wanted?!
I hope he realises I'm having it off regardless and I only text him to let him know?
I text my manager about getting this Friday and next Friday off for my course, 24 hours later still no reply...
@DyllanShikari thank you, gonna prepare hard hahah
@Markkisonfire happy birthday mate!
Got an interview with an employer on Thursday, if I smash this I've definitely got the apprenticeship, so no pressure I guess
@fuckoffcoldplay I've got like over a week off work in February so that's a good opportunity, get Tasha on the hype too!
@fuckoffcoldplay yes we really do! Been far too long
@_BornAnew_ that makes me feel slightly better, hooray for over-the-top reactions to peoples life choices!
@briefcasem0ng sounds like a plan!
@briefcasem0ng we should do something outside of Farnborough, so fed up of this place hahaha
@briefcasem0ng definitely. I'm off work from the 8th-18th February so that gives me a fair bit of flexibility haha
@briefcasem0ng I miss you too! It's been far too long
@briefcasem0ng I'm such a turd
To add insult to injury, that note I wrote was written on my kebab box...
She seemed bun but I can be such a dick when I'm drunk hahaha
On Saturday in my drunken state I left a note saying "fuck vegans" for Travis's (vegan) housemate to find and I haven't stopped feeling bad
My job isn't even that bad I'm just fed up of the monotony
If I don't get an apprenticeship this time round I'm gonna look into something else that I'd like to do, can't work in retail much longer.
Now that I'm home I'm feeling a LOT less negative, I think it's just work that does it to me
They did suck though, but it fulfilled my childhood
Glad I saw Blink while Tom was still in the band
Having too many negative thoughts today, it's really bringing my mood down
@suicideseasam that's such a joke! I think it's more hassle than it's worth tbh
I'm convinced they make it so long so that people don't bother and they therefore get more money
If I could be bothered to reclaim my car parking I'd be about £200 better off but it's such a ridiculous process that I never do it
So what you should have said was "please tell me what I want to hear" not "tell me what you think"
You ask me for my honest opinion then get offended when I give it to you....
@DyllanShikari you know! Ah shit I will do next time for sure!
@DyllanShikari went out to Vodka last night, we left at like 5pm today aha!
Winchester was decent, exhausted now though
@TheLegendOfLeo it was Tea Tree stuff, it gets a weak 2/10 from me
@TheLegendOfLeo it's the worst thing, makes me feel uncomfortably cold
I want to find whoever decided mint shower gel should be a thing and punch them in the dick
@Sn00pDean wonder if he got it on the low low
Someone on my Facebook has "Cocaine" listed as their interests
So close to walking out
Today is shit, work can suck a dick
The Deep End is just one of those albums I don't think I'm ever gonna get bored of. Well played @itchsspeeches
@TravisInTransit yeeee boy!
Winchester tomorrow, whey whey
So annoying when I flick down my timeline and 30% of it is her sharing another shit Harry Potter post from some shit Tumblr group
Someone I used to work with who's like, 23 years old is obsessed with Harry Potter, which is fine, but she plasters it all over Facebook...
Napped from 3pm until now, I'm up at 7:30 tomorrow so that was probably a bad shout
@LivvyOnAPrayer @MattTheHero good night though, thanks again for having us!
I got the milk:ice cream ratio all wrong in this milkshake and it's just not worth drinking now
@LivvyOnAPrayer @MattTheHero oh my days, could I look any more zombie like
@lucyemmonds_ thank you! Some people just have no sense at all haha
The amount of people that don't vote at all and you're telling people voting Green that their vote is wasted. How ridiculous!
It's your vote for a reason, use it in the way you wanna use it
Someone on Facebook just said "if you vote Green it's a wasted vote". Surely not voting for the party YOU want is more of a waste?
I haven't had a Twitter debate/argument in ages, that just reminded me how funny they can be
Someone come fight me, you can be safe in the knowledge you'll almost definitely win
I'm gassed for a fight now, this is what internet beef does to me
@tramper1975 @BlackpuddleRock stand for election then if you want to make a difference. Done arguing with you mate, fun as it's been.
Of course he's a UKIP voter, of fucking course he is! Explains everything. Done arguing with him now.
OH IT GETS BETTER HAHAHAHAHA WHAT A CLOWN
@tramper1975 @BlackpuddleRock throwing insults around just proves that you've ran out of decent points to make. Not that you made many...
@tramper1975 @BlackpuddleRock it may be, it may not be. What I'm saying is it CAN cause illnesses and kids shouldn't have to put up with it
@tramper1975 @BlackpuddleRock if it's addictive why would you want kids to be breathing it in? It's a matter of common sense really.
@tramper1975 @BlackpuddleRock no, I'm just not a cunt? It doesn't make me a "hero", it means I know when to put others before myself
@Sn00pDean init, he keeps rehashing and repeating the same points too hahaha
@tramper1975 @BlackpuddleRock are you trying to say that smoking doesn't contribute to cancer? Don't be silly mate.
