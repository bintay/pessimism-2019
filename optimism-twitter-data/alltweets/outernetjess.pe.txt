Rant over.
Live it up cause it's almost over. Don't end your high school career with negativity.
You're probably going to wish that you'd enjoyed the time you had here.
You're not going to look back and say, "Man, I wish I hadn't made myself look like a crazy person on Merica Monday."
You're going to be drowning in stress and essays and exams, you're going to miss high school.
If you're a senior and you're complaining about everything 3 weeks before graduation, step back and look at the next four years of your life
There's a bird loose in the school... Happy Merica Monday!
I can't believe how close I am to being done with high school...

I hate everything about gisd and the fact that people think it's okay to create a Twitter account dedicated to calling people ugly.
@smhfaisal @GISDuglies a Twitter account dedicated to wrecking people's self esteem isn't funny and it's not cute.
