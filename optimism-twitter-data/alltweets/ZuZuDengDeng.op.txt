Can I kick it?
George bought MW3 for three quid and all we've done is play custom games all day, sooooo many memories
Yh Harry's coming round, only thing im doing today is playing football tonight.
Part of the reason i can't stop listening to Action Bronson atm is the beats he raps over, so chill, so different and so dope.
Praying this peng weather holds out until football tonight
It's never good when Friday feels like Saturday, means I ain't getting shit done today.
It really doesn't feel like a Friday tho.
It might be first thing in a morning, it could be in the afternoon, but I always try find time for it.
My favourite part of my day is the 20 minutes I take to drink my coffee and listen to music on the speakers downstairs.
I recon he would be ginger. 
Pizza and The Incredibles
@rich_j_anderson hahaha if you see him in either you let me know
This feels bare weird.
Just realised I haven't seen my baby milo Bape t and this black obey one since summer 2013 and I have no idea what happened to them.
Walking into uni with no music because my headphones are broke fucking sucks, I need tunes!
Should of been a truck driver...<DELIVERY TRUCK> #clevelandisthereasonimcool 
Love wearing XL T's
New Cleveland hat came today, which is cool because as we all know, Cleveland is the, Cleveland is the reason im coooooooooooool

@FrancescaPadley ooooooo she went there, well played
I'm sorry but Harry Styles tattoos are wank, the fuck is that butterfly about? And this is coming from a guy with a Batman sleeve.

If you've never actually listened to any  Action Bronsons old tapes or albums then I seriously advice you too, dudes incredible.
Not in uni till two and I've already showered and eaten, kinda just twiddling my thumbs till then.
The moment you realise you've eaten everything, is the worst part of my day.
Reign Of Fire was actually pretty sick, can't believe I've never heard of it before.
@AlwaysRhiannon haha chain smoking to try and compensate, it never does make it alright haha
@AlwaysRhiannon trust, everything you'd normally do seems boring without haha
@AlwaysRhiannon I know that struggle haha good luck
Watching Reign Of Fire.
Food was actually amazing.
Well I'm full.

@A_ConsciousMind you pipe down you
Strawberry milkshake, obviously.
Got the sickest craving for a reeeeeeeeaaallly good cheeseburger, fries and milkshake.
What's even the point in being in uni with no headphones?!
Ok so one of my headphones has decided it doesn't work anymore, day ruined.
Eating porridge in my batman bowls makes its that much more enjoyable.
Fuck all happened all window tbf
What a boring transfer deadline, fuck all happened.
Being in at 10 tomorrow is so unfortunate, means i have to get ready to then come home an hour later, looooooooong
I definitely didn't need that peanut butter on toast at this time, but it was absolutely the right choice.
I wanna live in a world where cheese.is good for you.

@AlwaysRhiannon haha aww that sounds grim, probably the last time your mum asks you to kill after the mess you've made, dignified indeed tho
@AlwaysRhiannon hahahaa wow, that is pretty out there, I was gonna suggest build a catapult and fire it at neighbours haha
@AlwaysRhiannon not gonna lie, I've been given worse chores to do on a Sunday, you gonna get creative with it? Haha
Managed to blag a roll of film off Ben so it's time to go piss random people off with my camera.
Coffee, breakfast, coffee, that's how you start a day.

@sazzlesfl hahaha I'll leave it up to you
@AlwaysRhiannon you've literally hit the nail on the head! Salt, pepper, garlic, chilli powered, peng, can't beat it haha
When people tell you rib tattoos hurt more than other places, listen to them, because they are trying to save you.
I'm kinda pissed we ran out of time with this tattoo today but at the same time I'm fucking over the moon that pain is over, for now anyway.
@AlwaysRhiannon every night I come up with some extravagant dinner and then I'm like, fuck this, chicken and rice is easier. Cant go wrong
Everything hurts
Unfortunately ran out of time today but getting it finished off in a couple weeks.
This fucking hurts, damn ribs.
Sleeve finished, now the ribs....
I fucking love tattoo days, the nerves and excitement beforehand is always worth it
In like three hours I'm gonna be crying like a baby back bitch
Gotta go get a train home in half an hour and its absolutely pissing it down, great.
7am alarm is looking very unpleasant right now
Tattoo tomorrow <GRINNING FACE><GRINNING FACE><GRINNING FACE>

Needles to say I lost my shit.
Fucking Batman animated series from the 90's was playing on a projector in the middle of the club last night. It was fucking awesome.
The dangerous nap I took on the train saved my life tho.
I'm not entirely sure how I survived this morning.
@AlwaysRhiannon giv meh sum $$$$$ den
I'm not drinking till Thursday.
Fuck you hangover, bacon and eggs is winning this one.
The women behind me on the train smells worse than I feel.
On a bus and everything hurts.

Seriously, Batman cartoons are beinf played in a club and I literally don't know what to do
The 90's animated series of Batman is being played in a club and I'm literally losing my shit, the fuck is going on.

@GSpringthorpe I've said for years I'm not dressing as batman until I can afford a legitimate suit, it's the deal breaker I'm afraid.
Ie, no fried chicken, waffles and Mac n cheese.
Bare hungry, nothing in the house I want to eat.
I just need the funding.
See, if someone would give me the money to be Batman, I could have a crack at shit like this.
Would not he surprised if the president of France is packing a piece, seen more guns than people.
Freedom of speech works both ways, shout about what you want, but don't complain when you're getting shouted back at.
@JoeScott23 init, would not wanna fuck with these guys, especially after one of their own has been killed by these guys
If they get the order to go in, these french cops are not gonna fuck about.

@jordanmaher both huge dons
@jordanmaher oooooo.interesting,  I'll let.you know
@AlwaysRhiannon hmmmm, is it chocolate? If not I'd say your only other hope is a custard cream.
@AlwaysRhiannon eat a jaffacake, they usually solve everything.
About to watch The Drop, heard good things.
Imagine if that's how shit worked, tweet about food and WABOOM, it's in yo lap, technology, man they got this.

Sooooo many good films on tonight, literally spoiled for choice, no idea what to watch.

Never got the Huarache hype, their just not nice shoes.... hopefully the next 'big shoe' is of better taste.

Eastenders has actually killed it this festive period.
My dawg my absolute favourite.
The connection Faberge and my Nonno have is better than we ever could of dreamed, they secretly love each other.
All i can taste is frazzles from last night still and this is by no means a complaint
My ebay watch list is getting out of hand, gonna be a madness after my birthday and loan drops.

Impulsively just bought a load of stickers for my macbook and im honestly not too sure why.

Denzel at his best.
American Gangster is such a sick movie.
@sazzlesfl you keep quiet you
Not really too sure what list im referring too, but she is top of it.
There is literally no one alive sexier than Angelina Jolie, top of my list, has been for years and probably always will be.
Can't decide what movie to watch so im watching Wanted that ive seen a million times but, Angelina, so its alright.
If NYE was on a Tuesday there would be only one song to play all night...

ITV tryna get me to stay in tomorrow night by putting The Dark Knight on at 9pm, nice try, it almost worked, you crafty northern bastards.

"Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia, Jeremy. Welcome to the real world." 
Realised in the last few days how many films I've seen that have been ruined by a cop out ending.
Watched so much Peep Show this holiday and it's been fucking great.

@MartynaCielecka hmmmm, sadly, i think you might be right but i was hoping you was gonna gass me up with some nonsense :/
@MartynaCielecka yo, tonights Eastenders, is it gonna go off tho?!
Just remembered Eastenders is on at 8, my night just dramatically improved! Been waiting all weekend for this shit
@sazzlesfl haven't read it so thats a bonus i guess, mainly watching it because its his last film before Batman! hahaha
Gonna watch Gone Girl at some point tonight, head mixed things about it tho.
I always think seeing people complaining about not having a girlfriend/boyfriend is a massive turn off.
