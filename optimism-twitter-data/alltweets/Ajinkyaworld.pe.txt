@jperkovic93 That team is trying to reach an objective to keep Their Start player on top of the scoring charts. Nothing else matters to them
@i_am_sangi believe me, I know few retards who hate him. Hopeless fools.
Friend: Whats Ur favourite season?Me: 2010-11F: What..?Me: Oh Did u mean like summer, winter?F: What No. My fav is Season 3 of XYZ.WTF
<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Madrid lost to Juve.<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Barca revenged Bayern.<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Barca won d league game<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Madrid dropped points.<BALLOT BOX WITH CHECK> Barca 4 points clearSPRING TIME <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES><DANCER>
Nacho bc nacho...<PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Isco is such huge Barca &amp; Messi fan. He would play twice better at barca then he is playing at Madrid.
Now its going to be 2747482' extra time
But Ronaldo still has a reason to be happy. He is leading the Scoring chart &amp; he doesn't care about any of the rest things.
@erMESSIdi I had predicted that 2/3 months back &amp; that's how exactly its going to happen. Really Football is amazing
@Mandeep_fcb Dude really we got the much needed breathing space against Athletico. Now we can rest key player in Liga &amp; have a full go at CL
Have a taste of your own medicine,…
Lol it wud have been interesting had we dropped points against moyes boys n Madrid would have been in present state vs Valencia..
@FSeeBarcelona excellent.
Sorry but we should have started with Busquets &amp; Iniesta. La Liga is on the edge &amp; we need to secure it evry game.
@debasish_paul actually I felt it. Seriously relieved
My god that goal was a bigger relief than my last paper of exams..
plzzz anyone can tell me a channel on youtube to download highlights of barca games in ENGLISH commentary. I AM DESPERATE
@Nushk_Deshpande lol yeah, That's the only thing that could be logical. U choosing not to go <THUMBS UP SIGN>Now thats Lol @me
@Nushk_Deshpande Why d hell would anyone say no to U.???? <PENSIVE FACE>
@AddictedToBarca Lol may b because Leo liked Chelseas insta page.
@messileftfoot Yes May be but with Suarez &amp; Neymar along with Messi at ur disposal U can even find a solution to a world war Wtf is this bus
This #Messi pic is my Watsapp dp &amp; 4 girls have msged me saying 'Cute DP"Bloody hell girls He already has Anto. 
@david_07villa Fish. I missed that Music then. Thank god U atleast showed me those beautiful words.
@david_07villa shit In last tweet I meant *U wrote this??? Not *I wrote this
Life changer.
See you later.
Ankle breaker.
Legacy creator.
Camp Nou shaker.
There will be haters!

MESSI
@david_07villa I wrote this???Great poetry dude.
@david_07villa 22. U?
In Past Leo was scoring many goals, it was difficult to stop him. Today he is even providing many. Now its difficult to stop him &amp; Barca too
@david_07villa ohh U r too far to call out to play football one day <POUTING FACE>
@david_07villa I live in Pune, Maharashtra. And U??
The Fact that I loved is Whole Football world Saw both the CL semis &amp; The greats Bowed down to the talent of #Messi. They witnessed the King
@david_07villa haha Indian Cules Bhai bhai. Its great to discuss Barca with country mate.
@david_07villa I have learnt to now.
@david_07villa Haha..world really is enjoying the best phase of football, &amp; then look it's Us who cherish it the most. Thank U @FCBarcelona
Life is so wonderful when my TL is full of Majestic words about Barcas performance the night before. Pleasure to read it even a 100 times.
Defending Messi for one or two moments in a match is an achievement to be proud of, but defending him over 90' is a LEGENDARY one.
@david_07villa honestly I feel like why am I even discussing football with such narrow minded people.?
Many EPL fans r like EPL is tougher than CL. Oh.. dear Lord help those mentally blind people.
A friend, Chelsea fan Said MSN scored 100+ goals shows how weak LaLiga is. I pity such EPL fanatics.They will never realize the quality.
I feel for Neuer. Had a great game against Suarez, Neymar &amp; others initially. Then Last 15' Messi got in charge of Scoring &amp; then... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Rakitic has a tremendous work rate. Great game yesterday.
@JoshisButler90 For Fuck sake dont bother other people with ur "GENIUS" opinions. Irritating as fuck. GOODBYE.
AMAZINGGGGGGG..... 
@JoshisButler90 opposing opinions on a tweet that was just a sarcasm. ffs stop advertising ur opinions on the wrong window.
Well Thank U @FCBarcelona for this amazing game tonight.
Thank U #Messi for the Magic
Thank U God for existence of @FCBarcelona
Gn twitter
@JoshisButler90 lol.. more like a case of replying a but-hurt.
@JoshisButler90 Cant help if U dont get what Sarcasm is at the first place. better dont waste time of both of us.
@JoshisButler90 Seems like U had ur experience with it. Ur confidence JUST tells the whole story. I offer my sympathy bro.
@JoshisButler90 Practically not interested even in having a look at their faces.
this crazyness that Messi displayed today almost made us forget that we kept a clean sheet against Bayern without letting them have a go
@Mandeep_fcb I am against stupidity bro. so couldnt control
Whoever wants to compare Messi &amp; Ronaldo, get ur ass face in front of me. I will beat the shit out of ur family.
Fucking renew Dani Alves. Had a superb game. No RB in world is close to him

“witnessing lionel messi”
@ErGaurav10 What should I say man.I am speechless after this performance. Completely.
Itni khushi..itni khushi....
Filled up with emotions. No way in the world Barca fans can thank Messi for what he did today.
Neuer take this biaaatchhhh....
Neymar is a little kid who cant control himself to have just 1 candy from the box once he starts eating.
@ErGaurav10 shit.... <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Btw honestly Suarez is weak as fuck in his passing game.A good sticker but needs to get few tips from Xavi, after all this is Barca man
Messi needs to again look in to our scoring department for this game. Other r unable to finish the job.
Suarez must be one of most unbalanced player while sprinting. He is half bend down to the ground, so a slight push rattles him completely.
Barca are all set to win. We dominated the half but poor finishing is our worry
Messi has been a genius tho. Not quite lucky as Ronaldo to get any tapins to his name.
Every goal keeper plays the game of his life against barca. Joe Hart &amp; now Neuer
Their plan is clear. They will Atta k from right. Explore alves
Heartbeats r almost escaping out of my ribs. Man this is so tense..Barca win this tie without heart attacks plz...
Today keeping a clean sheet is so fucking important. Should not conceded an away goal at any cost. #Pique step up again for the team plz.
@xProudToBeACule no need to control against them. U can have a go.
@i_am_sangi exactly. He had a hat trick on hand + in race for Pichichi &amp; yet he does this thing. Adorable to worlds end.
We scored 2 against Sevilla easily then conceded 2 which were completely our mistakes So don't think Madrid will drop pointsHope I am wrong
@i_am_sangi the gesture wen Messi was on a hat trick &amp; offered the penalty to Neymar was greater than all those 8 goals. Sadly U missed that

Amazing people, amazing players. My heart is full.
Messi I have no words for u as a player as a team mate
Lol now just imagine #Ronaldo In place of neymar when #Messi scored that goal. He would have pulled out all his hairs In anger for sure
Alves is it really you. Who could have imagined barca is going to score 2 from 2 Alves croses. Give him ballonDor
Thank heavens that #Iniesta is getting in his best form just during the toughest part of season. No doubt he will walk on water for the team
#Suarez is literally like our plan B. Scores out if no where. We didn't had this for last 3 seasons. But now we are heavily loaded bitches.
What a team we have got when the midfield performs to the potential Just brilliant #Suarez has solved our problem of scoring out of no where

Getafe's coach: "They beat Real Madrid by 6 goals in Bernabéu, its okay." 

Me &gt; Real Madrid

Talk to Zidane face to face and tell him that Busquets is better than him.
#Memories r sweet &amp; the ones of this kind r just sweetest. shashankkhude Thank U for this lovely… 
Lol if we continue this way, win d league,CDR &amp; probably CL. The BallonDor finalist will be Messi Neymar &amp; Suarez.Not kidding ok.
@Mandeep_fcb No he is certainly not the same.
@Mandeep_fcb I knw that's The sad truth. I hate any kind of negativity &amp; Jose Mourinho with his style is the biggest of it.
Many of my friends started supporting Chelsea 5/6 years back. I fucking survived that horror disaster. Makes me a #Winner right?#ViscaBarca
@Mandeep_fcb I will quit watching football if I ever favour such hopeless style of play. NEVER EVERI say I am blessed not being Chelsea fan
#Chelsea's style of play against strong teams: Defend defend defend &amp; defend more for 80' then get away with 1/2 sneak goals.
@burt27 rather than crime I would say those rating him high r easy to recognized as fools.
Is there anything sexier than #Deepika's waist. So so so sexy man.. <HEAVY BLACK HEART><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
If I was in Albas place making those long runs at top speed and not receiving the pass I would have pulled out all my hairs in anger.
I hate wen pique commit so high on the pitch &amp; gets beaten easily because he has no pace to catch back. He is best wen he defends near post
Messi linking with Suarez &amp; neymar isn't a topic to discussWhat I am loving is how Suarez &amp; Neymar r linking up, evry move they make is osm
Suarez has been so wonderful since 2015, goals, assists, selflessness.Neymar is getting back to his initial form.And no words about Messi.
Messi can score from an Impossible angle, corner, position... He is just insane.
This game is so pure magic. I cant believe this combination of Messi Suarez &amp; Neymar. Certainly will go as best in history if they continue
If we play like this forever, no team in the world will come close to our level of game. Brilliant so far.
I want Messi to start from middle for evry game now on. The more he see's the ball the more better Barca play. Every game is a big one now.
@cule_kanva ohh man its going to be tough &amp; interesting. But I am quite confident we will beat this Bayern side who is not best at counters.
Does anybody know if Robben &amp; Ribery will b available for 1st leg vs Barca..??? Even gotze??
#HappyBirthdaySachin
@BarcaChief 'Iniestaaaaaaaaaaaa'
Athletico needs some who can pull out a 'Iniestaaaaaaaaaaa....'
We need to play Mathieu today Zlatan has physical advantage, we need 2 strong CBs besides I have observed Mathieu makes some decent blocks
It will be an interesting today, PSG will be out there to attack from kick off, then we have Busquets who will break their play &amp; feed MSN
Thr are very very very few people in Ind who know what …
We r 3 Goals up &amp; still the world knows we will play to score 3 more &amp; not sit &amp; defend that lead.Its such blessing not to b a Chelsea fan
@BarcAddicts When Alba will improve his finishing or say shooting, he will undoubtedly be better than Marcello. Marcello is beast though.
Luis Enrique : Improved Set-piece defending,Possession+Counter attack mix, Set piece goals, rotating players to keep them fit, Treble hopes.
I want Neymar to see injury list of Madrid's team &amp; go say sorry to lucho for all gestures he did wen he was subed off. Boss is always right
Malaga scoring now will make perfect picture for we Barca fans. Go Malaga go...
We have Suarez in his prime, Neymar Just starting to mature to his best &amp; Messi who is always Messi.I might dare say Best attack in history
#Suarez I scoring worldclass individual goals &amp; I am waiting when he will actually start scoring after playing those 1-2 passes with Messi
Brilliant article on Messi's tactical intelligence vs PSG &amp; in short about Iniestas new role under Lucho. 
@debasish_paul Thank u. #FFBack
The 1st touch by #Xavi to get the ball under his command is all u need to see to spot the difference between him &amp; all rest players.
Barca seems happy when #Messi scores but trust me they get happier when they see #Xavi making love with the ball every time he touches it.
@messinesss I am really confused between him &amp; Pogba. Hope Lucho knows the best.
#Barca need One young Midfield player who can control the whole game like Xavi or Modric &amp; with this Attack &amp; defence we will b invincibles.
Look what Lucho has done, We defend Set pieces like we were best at it, we even score them now a days. That's magic even Messi is proud of
Still cant get enough of those two world class goals by our own #Suarez. He has pure striker instinct in him &amp; Barca needed that as a Plan B

I almost forgot to wish her Birthday wishes. Happy B'day #EmmaWatson. Stay as beautiful as U r forever.
@Mandeep_fcb Me too man. I am also hurt thinking this. Iniesta needs to change something, whatever will make him more effective <CRYING FACE>
We scored 2 against Sevilla in half hr &amp; never showed intensity after that It did cost us. I don't want that today. If We score 10 go for 11
@Mandeep_fcb Yeah he plays out of his usual position. Initially we had Xavi to control the whole mid, which allowed Iniesta to play up front
Today we ought to score. Away goal is so fucking important at this stage of the CL.
We have to be thankful to #Pique for his Brilliant performance this season &amp; well played Mathieu &amp; Bartra when Our mid is not at its best
Honestly if we take out #Messi, Barca becomes an avg Team. And I am so sad about this fact. #Suarez #Neymar &amp; #Iniesta must step up big now
I am worried about our Mid. Busquets the only one who is playing at high level. Iniesta not at his best, Rakitic not creative at all.
@ErGaurav10 no. Pune. Kyu??
We should kill the tie today itself. PSG will miss their vital players &amp; this being an away game for us, every goal scored will be bonus
So Athletico carry an advantage in the 2nd leg. Marcello being suspended is really a good sign for them as well.
This early summer mornings r so pleasant in my City. Bright Sunshine &amp; Cold breeze, So refreshing that I felt to go on a date. Lol
@ProudCuler No Doubt.
@ProudCuler @Cristiano Perfect. This is so so so true.
Why the fuck this happens, I remember that I had some dream during night, but then cant remember a shit what was the dream about. This Sucks
Happy B'day @Carles5puyolMy fav memory is that bullet header in the 6-2 massacre of #Madrid &amp; celebrating by kissing the captains Band <VICTORY HAND>
If Alves joins utd, they will be more than happy after having someone like Valencia.
Hahaha Young should be given BallonDor by Messi himself. Goal &amp; now a assist
Hahahaha this is crazy. Home advantage what we call
Btw Ronaldo must be proud of Aguero after that tap in.
Lol City is toying United. I wish We had Silva. He has a brilliant presence of mind.
No no no... I wanted some cushion untill we played against Athletico Madrid in Liga. No these 2 point lead is not exactly safe
Fuck. M completely off. Never saw this coming after being 2 goals up in half hr. Shittttttttt
Sevilla is playing great. They r not allowing us to build our game &amp; attacking with evry chance they get without a hesitation.
@Mandeep_fcb exactly. These away games r tough..
Het on Xavi for Rakitic. We need to calm the game &amp; who better that Xavi Iniesta &amp; Busquets doing it together.
@ProudCuler ok. I understand don't wory. I,l try to be a good student
@ProudCuler I thought u,l show some mercy &amp; say no need. <DISAPPOINTED FACE><DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Fuck....Hope this goal doesn't hamper our great game so far
#Busquets is the answer for our brilliant game today. He has bossed the whole mid allowing #Iniesta to show his glimpses of brilliance.
Barca is really playing brilliant Footbal. Purest form.
@ProudCuler shittt. Kill me now. I am so stupid. I better write it down 100 tine like school days
Ahhhh Neymar finallyyyyy...That's a way to score a FK. What a beautiful one. Just inch perfect
Why did saurez stop.... No boy nooo
If U constantly watch #Busquets game Only U will realize his genius.
What a play My God Barcaaaa.#Iniesta Play like this forever plz
#Barca r playing perfect football. Full control, attacking constantly, Defending well, winning back possession quickly
My God #MessiWhat r U made up of. I am not ready to believe what I see when U have the ball. Absolutely magical. Take a bow
It seems like #Busquets is about to lose the ball, but then pulls out his brains and gets out of the situation like a boss with the ball
My Goodness #Messi... He is magic every time he touches the ball
Messi gets fouled really hardly due to his quick free, but he hardly cries back at the player or the ref. He just feels for losing the ball
If I had one wish, I would certainly certainly certainly ask to impart more common sense to people around.It will make life easy.
Just saw a photo of my City in a Magazine, it was more beautiful than it normally is &amp; I learnt today that it's about the way U chose to see
@kritisanon #Sketch #drawing #kriti 
Heavy advantage of playing #Messi in middle is we allow the best player more time on the ball, which surely isn't good for opponents. Simple
#Messi on Wing helps us create a lot of chances but then 90% r wasted. Better play him in middle and he will score 2 of 3 chances he gets
Poor midfield performance + We waste a hell lot of chances up front. We are creating many but wasting them is stupidity.
Few recent games have clearly shown that we don't have control in the mid. We r living dangerously once mid loses the ball. Thanx to Pique.
We crushed Sevilla 5-1 at home while that 1 was also an own goal by Alba.I don't say away game will be easy, but we can repeat Half of it
@fedology Ohh that's why the added the 'zero' at the end. They took is seriously serious.
#JordiAlba being back is a blessing. We r used to his pace in attack as well as tracking back within seconds. We r stronger with him.
We will Need #Xavi specially in away games where we r a goal or two up in the last quarter of the game. His possession play is Unparallel.
#Xavi staying is my priority for next season. With Iniesta being played out of position #Xavi is our best midfield. Controls the whole game
Btw if u haven't yet tried #CokeZero don't even try it. It is taste less drink
I am confused about Alves. He is our Best RB in history. He has past his best &amp; we expect same performances &amp; no one decent to replace him
@James_Hall92 Perfectly Said. No better answer dude. <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@SM_0141 @lucasammr That's quite a good idea. Barta will add advantage for defending + Scoring a set piece. He has good attacking brain too.
@James_Hall92 Yes that's how wise people understand. Its no point comparing them. Facts need to be accepted.
@James_Hall92 Yup Messi have revealed his versatility in an insane manner &amp; Only Ronaldo comes close for even a challenge in 1 area.
@James_Hall92 Yeah exactly. A great footballer &amp; probably the Best Athlete. That's it.
@James_Hall92 Comparison is fair only in respect of Goals. In evry single other aspect Messi wins by a big margin. Thank God Barca have him.
@James_Hall92 Yes we all respect Ronaldo for his goals, the no. Of it he scores. I would like him the moment he gets a bit more humble.
#Heaven, its not an imaginary place. Its a place on Earth wherever Your Mind, Heart &amp; Soul can find #Peace.Easy, Be around Ur #Friends
This work makes me believe that, if we involve ourselves in things we love (The art as well as… 
@Bl4ugrana Surely I can understand what U mean. Vote him for the best teacher award on my behalf too.
@Bl4ugrana lol that might just make u to like maths a bit more than normally it wud have.
@Abrobin_3 @Lucasammr Its just a matter of time 1 or harldy 2 more years &amp; Messi will be out of his reach.
Hell man it hurts to trim ur beard after U have grown it well.
Never was a fan of #flowers, but gotta agree they make everything colourful#Instapic #Colours #India 
#Barcelona don't ever ever ever dare to let #Xavi Go. We will be screwed without him. He is still the best mid we have got.
Time for much needed #InnerPeace. That's lucky 3 points. Thank heavens for Mathieu. Get ur shit together next time Barca &amp; specially Neymar
We r already having average midfield performance this season &amp; Xavi talks about leaving. Irony.
Plz get Rakitic in for Neymar asap. We need to defend with full strength.
Common now pump us barca &amp; finish this. We have the momentum on our side, a Goal more &amp; I can sleep in peace
Hahahaha A set piece hurt Madrid again. Ohh &amp; that's the same guy who hurt them couple if weeks back Mathieu with 2 huge goals of his career
Gotta win this.. We have to face Sevilla &amp; Valencia in coming days. God help us, Messi help us plz..
May b playing Xavi with Iniesta &amp; Busquets help us as golden days if they involve messi.
I feel a Late Messi winner for Us today to save our ass.
We need to Invest in Midfield this season &amp; guess what our Mastero is thinking of leaving. Life will be hell
I don't know if Neymars good performance in early half of this season has got him on cloud 9. Get down ffs n play football boy.
Messi's good game makes Saurez &amp; Neymar look good together. If he stays quite they both get exposed.
Well not only life but even twitter gets amazing when football returns. Missed the match tweets badly.
I dont knw what this Barca team would have been if had Xavi Iniesta Busquets all in top form supplying MSN &amp; Puyol back defending Invincible
@Juve93Cule Actually we need a goal scoring Midfield, we lack that part in our game.
@Juve93Cule I guess we need a strong personality who is fast, physically strong, shoots brilliantly, skilful &amp; Pogba fits in.
I am just so so glad that Messi got 2 weeks break. This will just make Us ready for final part of season.
@kritisanon U are gorgeous &amp; hope U have a promising future in Bollywood. Keep smiling,U have a best of a kind.
If we all just live a life where we see that our actions don't be any sort of problem for others, then that would be real Peace.
I have been eating a lot of #Biryani lately, as if I am living on it. Just love It.
Injury of Vermaelan was a blow to our plans initially. Hope that turns to be a blessing at the end of season to win Liga, CDR &amp; challenge CL
#Rakitic: Complete midfielder. Good passing, good defensive performance, good shooting, goals now &amp; then. A great Bargain we had. Splendid
Our hopes for winning Liga depends lot on how Pique plays the rest of season. He has been tremendous this season. Othr CB should deliver too
2 weeks rest which #Messi got was so vital That man has been playing every single game. He is reloaded now for important phase of the season
I still don't believe that Leo is/was actually injured. He needed rest after playing a lot &amp; for next busy month. That's it. I am glad.
@Mandeep_fcb Ur answer deserves a noble. Perfectly said.I try it sometime anyways.
@Mandeep_fcb haha... No I was serious about it. Early morning I was so frustrated while driving n found many women driving stupidly.
Well I was just wondering if we keep a separate lane for all #women drivers we could solve traffic problems in #India. I am damn serious
I still don't see how #pedro will fit in as a RB. Attacking will be ok. But wat about defending tactically?Now We realize imp. Of #Alves
@sanketutd They hadn't played Spain till then right? Btw booing Iniesta is not the correct way. He ain't any arrogant player.
Iniesta booed by Dutch fans yesterday. Mental people or but hurt ones, that WC goal still makes them mad
If Not India, I wanted a team who haven't yet won the WC to win it. #SA &amp; #NZ had to win it. Someone help them plz..
@Mandeep_fcb haha that's right. U have a distant imagination. God.Any ways m sleeping. Gn.
@Mandeep_fcb hahaha Its not bad that U r asking them to do wats best. U r a good teacher. A choice of new a career I guess.
@Mandeep_fcb Than god its 10 day &amp; nots 2/3 weeks.
@Mandeep_fcb Sach Mai. I was so happy listening to those lines. I blessed her on the spot. She knows football &amp; she recognises the gem. Good
@Mandeep_fcb Seriously cant Imagine Barca without Messi at this stage of season. So hope this break be kind to us.
@Mandeep_fcb haha majority of hate it. End of season where we need to be best &amp; hope not this international break causes any injuries.
@Mandeep_fcb That's what I was shocked about. We were watching his video on YT &amp; She suddenly said it.I have No idea how. But made me proud
I could barely Nutmeg 11 yr kid, when I play considerably good football. I felt like ShitI blame #Messi. He made it look easy as fuck.
I was playing football with my 11 yr old niece. Had decide to nutmeg him But its hell difficult. Could do only once after trying 12/13 times
I am so happy that Messi isn't starting for Argentina. That man needs rest.I hope he returns to Barca fresh &amp; Hungry as ever
My Niece just said that "best thing #Messi has is, He doesn't have a big ego" I was so pleasantly shocked to listen this from a 11yr old kid
@ProudCuler Sure..
@ProudCuler Ohhh shit shitJust checked that it has got saved in same way in my mobile dictionary now. So now it autocorrects in wrong way <ANGRY FACE>
I have always said Messi's biggest achievement is not winning a BallonDor but perhaps being permanently a challenge for the rest competitors
Achieving peak success is difficult, but bigger challenge lies in maintaining that level &amp; who does it for longest period is know as #Messi
Does Even #Pele get down from Cloud 9 ever.?? His comments r forever so egoistic as if nobody ever played football except him. Be Humble man
At #Liverpool game was played around #Saurez. At Barca we cant do that, we have best player in world. So Credits to Saurez for his adaption.
I don't understand why people started believing in #Saurez only after he scored in Clasico. He was the best striker in world &amp; Needed time.
People have made FB shitest place now a days. Literally a joke how many don't understand what to share &amp; what not toHope twitter stays pure
I wish I could watch Brasil play. But cant. Gn twitter.
@ProudCuler <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Xavi Busquets Iniesta made best midfield trio becoz one was creative, one rotated the ball, one broke the opponents attack All to perfection
@ProudCuler Ok. I stop now. Relax.
@ProudCuler Ur learning from MSD to be humble huh..???But take it this time.
@ProudCuler arey trust me U deserve a bigger shoutout for that type of thinking.
If what #Pique says about his son Milan is true, does it means He dislike his moms songs.Well I don't blame, I like the videos more. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Lol as per @ProudCuler #MilanPiques Friends will fall for his Mom. While #CR7's Son needs to find one for himself as well as his daddy <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I don't yet consider this true that Xavi leaving or Say don't want to believe.But without Xavi suddenly Impact of midfield reduces to half.
@Mandeep_fcb Hahaha.. That was epic thinking. But yes indeed few think that being 'Too' much funny makes them attractive. Mental surely
A guy left a 1D band &amp; My TL has become worst since then. I mean they make me fear the future incase Xavi leaves. DON'T LET HIM GO #BARCA
@Mandeep_fcb How is it possible for any one in this world to hate ABD. What's wrong with this people yar.
There r few who think themselves as very funny &amp; sometimes they cross the limits just becoz few other idiots support them.That's #Twitter
Its makes me mad that many people don't understand the difference between trolling &amp; Trolling to such level were it gets insulting. Stop Ffs
@ProudCuler Indeed the Best ever. Keep watching, keep loving, keep supporting &amp; keep tweeting #Barca
Just read my Last Tweet. Something nice about MSD
That Last line My God..."@Geeyaaaa: A fan wrote this. But seriously, how true is it even! #DareToBeDhoni 
@ProudCuler Honestly Its so Good to find a girl supporting football Becoz she loves it &amp; Not becoz her BF loves it &amp; Specially An Indian gal
@ProudCuler I am from Maharashtra so A Mumbai supporter + Sachin was a big reason behind it. But I never had problem with CSK. Enjoyed them
@Mandeep_fcb haha he nailed it.
@SubahAhmed @FCBJulian @Barzaboy ohh brilliant then I will happily take Anto <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
@ProudCuler Haha.. That must certainly be another Record to his name. Shortly Pique &amp; Neymar will involve him in Poker too.
@Mandeep_fcb I am very well aware of Immaturity amongst people. I face it everyday. We simply cant do anything but ignore those brainless.
@Mandeep_fcb many people r indeed such Crack nuts. They need Hopeless reasons to console themselves rather than facing &amp; accepting reality.
Reason #14268291 why he is a great l…
Indian Media U r a fucking disgrace. Shame on The News Channels. Your news presentations r more dreadful than the defeat
@Saks_FCB Exactly. Spot on. Every team would want Dhoni &amp; Look at few Indians.I wouldn't swap him even for 3 M.Bevans
@dhyani_vivek Ganguly was vital in bringing up viru, Yuvi, Bhajji. Hope Kohli does the same &amp; get some quality in pace attack.
@dhyani_vivek its a good point considering we need to build up for future Specially reliable bowlers. I hope Kohlis attitude doesn't ruin it
@Saks_FCB They r the people who hold their grudge upon him bcoz he plays for CSK. Complete nonsense.He is the Best captain india ever had.
@david_07villa Sure.
@dhyani_vivek Kohli is our best batsman But The leadership qualities MSD have r unparallel He has good tactical brain 2 make correct changes
@dhyani_vivek next big event is the T20 WC. Considering that OF COURSE.
Well never wanted Dhoni to see his daughter for the 1st time after losing a game specially the WC Semifinal.Anyways have a good family time
@david_07villa I wonder they even have any kind of Head.
decide whether to play next WC or not"-MSD
Do U even have a brain if U want Dhoni to retire? He is the best hope Indian has got &amp; some brainless people hate him bcoz he plays for CSK
"I'm not sure about it."

*one billion people heave a sigh of relief*
Kohli,Raina,Dhoni.
Have a gut feeling th…
@ADILRajkaran Yes 320 would be job well done after initial fall apart.
@saurabhfoot I take it back dude. Hope This games turns as aa sweet end for us.
@saurabhfoot I take it back dude. This game I turning on for Us.
This is a fucking flat track. If any if Indian batsman fail today I am going to kill them. With our lineup we can chase something around 350
Maxwells early departure means surely 40/50 runs less than it could have been. Good for India. Still hopes.
Lol Should India celebrate this wicket.? Because it is Maxwell who walks in. Even bigger disaster..
Pique always had problems in displaying consistent high performances. This season he over came that. He has played whole season brilliantly.
There was a stupid Madrid fan mocking #Saurez few months ago &amp; I had replied him 'Wait untill he hits his top form'Ohh God who was he? Fuck
@Mesutosity ok I will read it. But just for a fact if whatever Zlatan said is considered as true then that would literally b a joke.
So we take the charge in our hands for not wearing the similar clothes with different shades this… 
I just Loved this pic #Messi left him sweeping the floor. #ElClasico #Barcelona 
@lucasammr Iniesta is asked to do the role of Xavi, Rotate the ball. While Messi is doing what Iniesta did, being creative.
Rakitic is a great midfield player like many others. But He has to inherit Tiki Taka to make him more effective pairing with Leo &amp; Busquets
@barcastuff @Jomotseringma Beautiful Pic.
U might face toughest decision to prefer one team over other but Ur a psycho if U hate any of #NZ or #SA. Their players r Gentleman #CWC2015
@Mesutosity Villa Played brilliantly scored most from assists by Messi. Zlatan &amp; Sanchez aren't Tikitaka players &amp; not victims.
@RafaelH117 The Quality of service he receives is the difference. He was always a good finisher, at Barca he gets better supply vs big teams
Benzema Has always been a threat in Clasico for us. But still I cant hate that guy. He is rare RM player not to have been affected by Madrid
We got Saurez to score goals out of no where, didn't get him to score tiki taka goals &amp; He has been doing exactly what a Pure striker does.
@EbrahIMred yeah long time. M good busy with CA clases lately. Wat About U.? Seems like U enjoyed the game as perfectly as it can be.
@EbrahIMred Dude U have a golden chance to get Bale. He has a fucked up life against hopeless Madrid fans.
For past 2 Seasons #Pique was an avg defender prone to making silly Mistakes. But not any more.I never dreamt he will b back to his Best.
@Juve93Cule Aren't We blessed to have Him.? And probably that's the reason he will b remembered forever &amp; not only untill he plays.
Ronaldo cant play with another Superstar on the pitch. Kaka, Ozil, Dimaria, Xabi, Bale all became Victims &amp; such great set of players left.
@Juve93Cule haha yeah He got the bitter taste of Madrid just like another Great Kaka. May b Ronaldo with one more super star doesn't work.
@Juve93Cule RM fans r obsessed with CR7 - Messi competition. They will prefer a BallonDor for CR7 Rather than any title for teamBale victim
@Juve93Cule &amp; U knw once Bale leaves after such incidents, Later respected players will hesitate to Join RM. Hope Hazard Doesn't join them.
@Juve93Cule Pathetic. Idiots. Shameless fans. Bale deserves much more. He scored decisive winner in CDR final &amp; even CL final last season.
If u didn't observe,But #Saurez is horrible with through balls or attempting Last pass in front of goal. One area where he must do better.
@Ay_Vy Yeah the record shows so. But I have respect for that man for what he has done to Athleti. And I want to take that game seriously.
@Ay_Vy Yes for Sure. The fact that we have to play a tough game Against Athleti away, this gap will be Vital. Hope Barca don't screw up.
@akshjjw Disgusting Fans. I thank Heavens for being a Barca fan. We chanted names of Saurez &amp; Pedro when they were not scoring. Shame Madrid
Liga now offers us to make 1 mistake &amp; even then be leaders. So so good to have this Cushion &amp; a single mistake by Madrid is Gold for Us.
Yesterday We defended all corneres quite nicely except one where Bale put the shot wide. This r good signs for a even stronger next season.
@Mandeep_fcb Thnx Again. U to have my Wishes with U always.I,l sleep now. Its almost Sunrise for us.Gn.
@Mandeep_fcb haha Obviously since #Barca is best thing that's close to football.
@Mandeep_fcb Well that's really a lovely compliment. Thanx indeed. Yeah my attempt is in November 2015.
@Mandeep_fcb haha Ok.I hardly had any other topic accept football to discuss on twitter &amp; now u brought a new one But Football &gt; Everything
@Mandeep_fcb I too agree its tough, M also trying my luck.
@Mandeep_fcb btw MBA in finance kya???
@Mandeep_fcb ohhh toh Tu bhi CA ka beta hai. We share few same facts. Mai bhi. Hahaha..
@Mandeep_fcb Thank u so much. I am doing CA. Onto last Exam but a really tough one.Wat abt U??
My goodness There r actually some RM fans who r happy after the loss as a fact that Ronaldo Scored. Or I guess must be Man Utd fans.
@Mandeep_fcb Thnx bro. I hope I do such Analysis with my studies <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Literally thinking what Ronaldo did in whole Game. One Tap in which was a benzema favour, Piss poor passing hardly had got 20/25 touches
Lucho has completely turned this Barca Side. We r witnessing a new mix of Barca We scored from Set piece &amp; A long ball &amp; We defended corners
Madrid had a 1 Week gap before clasico. While we played City in-between. Proud of U #Barcelona
#Xavi is bigger than life. He played those 15/20' Odd mins like old clasico days &amp; let whole Barca play the Same.Don't argue he Being Best.
What to say about #Pique. Absolutely Mastered his game. I even loved Mathieus defensive performance. Good job Luch
@Mandeep_fcb If he thinks He still can be compared with Messi, well let him. We don't care we got the Best player.
Saurez scores such difficult goals &amp; Bottle's the sitters &amp; Yeah he should drastically improve his through pass accuracy.
Clear difference was the time spent by #Messi on the ball. 1st half he didn't, we suffered. 2nd half he Did Madrid suffered. He was selfless
I bet My Life that this loss doesn't bother Ronaldo. He scored the tap in goal, what he came for &amp; then didn't even try a penny after that.
Don't ever Dare to let #Xavi Go of Barca. He is Irreplaceable.
This Ref should Go and Kiss Perez's Ass. One of the most worst or corrupt refs I have seen
Fuck U cunts #RealMadrid.4 Points gap. We played against U &amp; the Ref &amp; we Won.
I will kill the board if they let #Xavi go
No corners pleaseeee
That's what happens when Messi sees more ball. Never did in 1st half
This Ref Has been a Cunt. Our players dare not even blow an air at any RM player in our Penalty area. He will give the penalty immediately
OMG didn't even pay attention at the click just over 10' to control. Good we have fresh midfield legs
@Manni_FCB more like panicked defending.
RM has probably been fueled out due to playing high 1st half. Our best chance to score 1 and end the game. We r coming close.
Marcello is one hell of a player. Has those typical Samba skills, Stamina like Animal, fast than avg.
Ronaldo has scored so he is so happy that he wont care if RM lose.
More than Finishing the 1 though control was magical by #Saurez
Now don't fuck this up please Barca....This has been a magic goal which came out of no where. Now control the momentum
Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any fucking thing ever
Ffs we r not even running, how the hell we will score n win.
Btw that Ronaldo Goal: How can we keep so many miles open up right at his feet's. He is master of running in and touching the ball to get in
Ok now play the Game like we played 1st half against City please
Effective MSN means where Messi is 70% &amp; Neymar &amp; Saurez Sharing rest 30%. He should see the ball more. That's the key.
Fuck these Madrid Cunts run fast as fuck
Without Pique we would have been humiliated at that last 20' Of 1st half.
@Mandeep_fcb we need to involve Messi. Busquets does that or say he is used to that.
Messi isn't getting the ball, then how the fuck r we going to create impact. Simple. Get Busquets in, he does that job perfectly
We NEED TO RISK BUSQUETS. No control at all. Not even a bit. We get the ball then gift them &amp; defend like all panicked
We r playing bad now. But half shud change it &amp; we will win this
We should Make an Arrangement to get the fans as close as possible to the pitch in Clasico.
Messi to score
If we win this Game Then Mathieu ur Soul is blessed forever. Now defend n keep a clean sheet &amp; Become a Legend
Bastratdsssssss got Punished.We scored a set piece against Madrid.Ag FFS hfleoahdjdlsossgsbdisidjsks big bsskdjsjsjsj
If Ref wants to prove his EPL merve, he can Fuck off. He is behaving like Mental
Thank Goodness we have Alba as LB. Anyone else would be a joke vs Pace of Bale
Iniesta is playing with full energy. that's bad news for Real Madrid.
Wow CAMPNOU is Heaven.
Not seeing Xavi starting the clasico hurts.
FO the 1st time I like Madrids mid as a professional. All 3 r good players, Calm players &amp; Not animals.
We out played City. So no doubt we will at least have a decent performance and a good win today
Neymar has a knack of performing in big pressure games. So be ready for a Neymar Goal or 2 today.
I dream of watching Clasico in Campnou. But BC cant handle the pressure sitting in front of TV god knows what I,l b like In CampNou.
@ErGaurav10 Haha <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
but we have one advantage...

we have messi on our side..
@i_am_sangi whites will receive it while We will earn it May b.
@Mandeep_fcb Ok. Haha I knew U never wud have had problem with that &amp; Yes Clean sheet will be gold.
if he gives away penalty fr divenaldo den v r in fr real trouble..
@ErGaurav10 If Madrid lose today, Liga will probably be over &amp; That's why I am scared of refs today. There must b orders to keep Liga alive.
@Mandeep_fcb We will be, Even then I will do it. Probably 3 times now being happy &amp; Mad at same time.
#MSN &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; #BBC
#ElClasico
I will fucking Kill Ronaldo if he goes down without a contact. I will fucking kick his ass too.
Both Line ups r strong &amp; their best 11 in particular. But believe me We have a stronger Bench. That will be key I guess. Hope we kill d game
Mathieu Is physically our strongest player, He runs fast so its logical to start him against physically taller n stronger team.
I want Rakitic to make up for his mistake in Bernabeu wen his bad corner led to a goal. All the best man.
Rakitic must mark Modric I guess. This will reduce Madrids effect considerably.
Kroos individually is less effective, but combination with Modric gets best out of him. We need to Mark Modric tactically today.
Messi has to do a Messi today. Messi must score like Messi today. Messi must assist like Messi today. Messi to destroy Madrid like Messi
@i_am_sangi haha.. Twitter friends indeed.
Mascherano starting So we have a defensive cushion now #Iniesta &amp; Rakitic to keep possession, #Messi b creative, Ney &amp; Saurez Destroy Real
@i_am_sangi 4-2 Barca. I knw its wired.
I am getting a good strong feeling that Neymar will play a brilliant game &amp; Score as Messi will supply him some orgasmic passes.
@ErGaurav10 Exactly. that's my biggest fear. PENALTYif we win d game mite probably decide the season &amp; Madrid press wont want this scenario
@ErGaurav10 cool hope UR new place be lucky for U n whole BARCA
Dominating Midfield will be the key. Keep rotating the ball &amp; our attack has potential to score with a sneak in between. Iniesta take charge
#Pique needs to play his best game today. He wont have luxury of Busquets to help him defending crosses.
Considering Busquets wont start we have 1 less taller player from very few. Only Pique &amp; Mathieu vs Cr7, Bale, Benzema, Pepe, Ramos.
We have a big threat via corners. Cr7, Ramos, Peps, Bale, Benzema all r fucking dangerous &amp; we have only Pique who deals quite better.
Happy Birthday #RonaldinhoU r the reason I started playing football, supporting #Barca &amp; believing in Magic. Thank U 
If the news of Xavi having made a decision to leave is true I cant handle this. Barca without Xavi.. No God please. Xavi ffs stay.
@Mandeep_fcb Yup... Time to wrap the tie there itself. I don't want heart attacks in 2nd leg. We will go thru with ease.
@FCBxshot ok that's big news. We better wrap the tie in 1st leg itself.
@clicketyyclick that's a big news. So we can wrap the tie in 1st leg itself. Good.
We shouldn't be very happy getting PSG. They overcame Chelsea. Ffs give them some high credit. We r a stronger team no doubt. #ViscaBarca
So we play the 1st leg away. Am I right??
So most probably Barca Bayern Juve &amp; hopefully Atheltico Madrid to be in Semis.
I think Zlatan is on red which is not yet withdrawn, so he mite miss the 1st leg vs Barca??
This is frustrating. Rule should be there not to play same teams untill semis man. Fuck. Boring. PSG.
I'd like to avoid Bayern n Even Juve, they r playing really good. They have good mid + tevez is in a mad form

Barça fans = Bayern

Bayern fans = Real Madrid

Real Madrid fans = Atleti

Atleti fans = Barça
Facing Athletico Madrid will be irritating. We already faced them 3 times + 1 Liga away game yet to be played &amp; then these 2 games if at all
@RafaelH117 @ErGaurav10
Since #Messi has started to play a role of creative mid, providing so many assists, #Iniesta has been doing role of Xavi. #Professionals
Problems r never the problem the problem is the solution. I am tired of telling to search for a Key &amp; not to sit crying inside locked doors.
There's a big big huge Difference between Decision making &amp; Actually doing it. That's the fine but clear margin between Success &amp; failure
Joe Hart must be the proudest person on planet. He earned the respect of Messi, All Barca player, Barca Fans, Football fans &amp; mine too Lol..
What... Busquets back in training with the group.?? Is it true.?This has to be the best news of the day.
Biggest fear I have about Clasico is we conceding a penalty. I am not even joking it this time. seriously we know how Ronaldo acts.
@mandeep_fcb It is going to work. Don't wory we play at Camp Nou.
@mandeep_fcb Yeah all r nervous, but this mad man Messi with the kinda of form he us in restores my faith + we have Saurez &amp; Neymar.
@mandeep_fcb hahaha.. Now Madrids ass to be next
Mascherano saying Messi controls Football as for others its vise versa. So true.
@mandeep_fcb yeah exactly &amp; Messi's nutmegs &amp; performances in 1st half must have demoralized city for sure.
Kompany I was laughing my ass out when U wer mere spectator yesterday watching Messi &amp; his Passes whistling pass ur ears, brain &amp; ASS allday
@mandeep_fcb Actually. Thank god Rakitic at least scored that 1st with good presence of mind.
Diff. Between City &amp; Madrid, that w'l be playing against Better defence, Faster players, Diving, Derby nerves, targeting Messi, corrupt ref.
In second half we didn't try hard to score but even than we created so many chances. In Clasico I want us to score at evry attack. Kill them
#Barca really made all fans so proud yesterday. Wonderful game of football. Lovely Passing, Magical Messi everything except More goals.

Oh, believe me, he would make all teams there look like Eibar and Cordoba.
All The rest of 10 Man City players except the one whom Messi nutmeged at a time must really have enjoyed the way of playing football.
Appreciation tweet for Joe Hart. Absolutely wall today. Anyone else would have easily let 3/4 in. My MOM.

#BarcaVsManCity
Qatar Airways 1-0 Etihad Airways
Suarez and Neymar's form is temporary.
HahahahahahaThis is me laughing at Kompany who is just watching Messi or his passes whistling pass his ears, his nose, his arms, his ass...
Messi is Untouchable. Don't make a joke of urself to compare him with any human being.
I just love the way we get the ball out of our penalty area with absolute command &amp; skill
I think Since Alves plays on same flank as messi he has eventually developed better 1-2 passing with Messi than Iniesta has.
Pique has been massive today, but he had no real challenge so far. He has dealt brilliantly with so far
Today saurez has not been at his usual god. Misplaced simple passes that might have led to goal.
Let us make ourselves more happy by realizing that we r playing so good without Busquets who is actually backbone of good games.
I have always said, Lucho should work on improving Albas finishing &amp; we will score 1 or 2 more than we usually do.
Seriously This game, this world is not enough for for #Messi. He has a talent that cant be touched.
Pep must have realized that #Messi today &gt;&gt;&gt; Messi of his era &gt;&gt;&gt; Any football player on planet.
Even Mathieu has done nothing wrong, infact he did some really good n strong work.
Kompany u better keep playing with the tough Stoke, that's How recent EPL standards have fallen.
Tevez goal was a joke. So much power behind with just one step on the ball.
Iniesta may not b assisting a lot lately, but If u understand football, u knw that he is playing the rotating game quite perfectly.
This is fucking easy than I thought. After that Goal we r literally playing with under 16 team of City.
City defenders r already tiered as if they have played 120'.Messi certainly the man of the half. He is insane.
Milner must b feeling like to suicide even after 10' past that incident. Lol He will never forget that I bet
That Goal have done us wonders. City r fucked up &amp; Barca r playing orgasmic.
Barca iS Toying with EPL champions.Lol #Pep. Hahahahaha...
That Messi assist: Watch it right from the moment Messi collected the ball. The way he did it &amp; Then the run with 2 players around him
My God I just cant even describe Messi anymore. @RayHudson is the man I need to consult.
Font even dare to Tag Messi for a price. He is priceless. He is a goal scorer, assist provider, Decent defender &amp; a match winner &amp; goat
Neymar is taking the game lightly. He should protect the ball seriously &amp; not just b casual as if playing against 10 year old.
Fuck the card. Messi don't b injured ffs. U cunt silva
Messi has a brain of a genius
Messi Nutmegs as if its a breakfast.
We r not even trying to intercept. We r just allowing then to pass easily. Wake up guys. We need to score 1st at any cost
Fuck man... We r not having the possession. We cant play this way. City r passing good.
Since afternoon I am feeling very confident about todays game. We defeat City nicely without heart attacks. #ViscaBarca
Today #Iniesta has to have a decent game. All He needs to care about is being creative as having Masche as CDM makes us defensively stronger
I still don't believe we moved from Pedro-Messi-Sanchez to Neymar-Messi-Saurez. Sanchez was good but not a player for our system.
If its not India then I would certainly want Either of #Newzeland or #SA to win the #CWC2015.
@Ay_Vy That's always a good lineup against strong teams. Solidity in midfield wins U games + Masche can b shifted back after scoring 1st
@TeamMessi the new shoes of #Messi r really wonderful, probably best so far by #Adidas.Ohh God I wish I had those pairs.
Considering horrible Home performances by other teams in CL I am nervous today. But then Other teams did not have Messi Neymar Saurez.
@clicketyyclick @Messi10stats God bless ur words.
Lol Dani Alves starring his brand of clothes n all stuff. I bet that's going to be very wired. Probably Lord Song will be his 1st customer.
Just saw the movie #AttacksOf26/11 &amp; I am absolutely shattered. I cant believe the mentality of few who live besides us can b so disgusting.
@kevvwill Exactly. 1st goal will be priceless. We should get the 1st &amp; play like Xavi style the rest game.
I'l hate if anybody gets injured This week. Mightily important week in terms of LaLiga. A win will put us 4 pts clear. Easy life.
@malvika97 what a week of football. We go through CL, then RM gets the easiest draw possible &amp; We beat them in Clasico. Gonna b this way.
@ProvyHernandez @AddictedToBarca haha.. Perfect name. Deserving.
Wish U a very Happy Birthday @sanketutd  <BIRTHDAY CAKE> Have a great successful year in terms of academics &amp; ur love life too.U always have our wishes.
@lnoel_messi_10 actually that thought should b taken seriously. Winning it 5th time. INSANE. It should be much more than just a BallonDor.
Success also brings a type of a ego that Ur doing/did what others wish to &amp; the one who stays humble despite of that makes him an Idol.
I will like Ronaldo the minute he drops his arrogance. I love Messi, Iniesta, Iker, Xavi, Scholes.. bcoz of their Humility above everything.
#Maturity &amp; #Commonsense is what I pray for the people of this world everyday. So many idiots around that I sometimes feel like #Sherlock.
@erMESSIdi btw r nutmegs counted in as dribbles or not.?
@slicesofIife It was simple I u wud have said = Tendulkar
I would even dare to start Bartra in the clasico. He is less prone to making silly mistakes + brave enough to attack seeing the chance
Rakitic Rafinha Roberto n mid will be interesting. Glimpse of future hopefully. Please we need to win.
Raina plays most of innings when we just need to score fast. Today he got a chance to play long &amp; he did it &amp; that too in his vintage style.

Lol Idk how to relate it but interesting lines 'Lion doesn't roar to show his presence, the silence in jungle is the proof of his existence'
@debasish_paul hahaha... That was a great punch. Of course I meant athletico Madrid, the better of Madrid's.
Quality of #Barca &amp; #Madrid is so high that EPL fans think the rest Liga teams r walk in a park. Ffs. Liga Is superior in terms of technique

The man wants to ki…

One plays to win. The other plays to not lose. 

And that wont change.
This 1 week Gap between our next tougher games was so fucking necessary for Messi. He has been playing every fucking game this season.
#Neymar's suspension for previous game, followed by a gap of whole week for next game, will be a blessing for Us. He got the rest he needed.
I don't knw in what way to thank God for helping #Saurez return to his goal scoring form just at the perfect moment for us. Help us man.
I just hope that Messi's penalty miss at last min against city wont b a problem for us. Or I,l b mad as hell
Recent Home performances of Madrid &amp; Chelsea have left me fucking nervous, as we Face City the stronger of the opponents those two faced
CL Semifinals Draw is going to one big hell of thing this time.
Only Bayern is the clear favourites for CL finals. Barca is next hoping they defeat City again. Then comes RM &amp; probably Juve/PSG
@ErGaurav10 well said. exactly.
- Zlatan Ibrahimović on his red card
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>LMAO <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@ErGaurav10 Exactly. Its competitive no doubt, but not the best quality teams. Its Physical play more than actual football.
Lol #Zlatan always has something funny or either insulting to say in the press. Calling Chelsea 'Babies' was good reply. Haha..
Now that Chelsea is out it leaves Bayern, Madrid &amp; hopefully Barca when we knock out city as CL favs. But Dont just ignore Juve yet.
#Bayern r really dangerous. They have an all-round team stronger in evry position &amp; then Pep is good reader of opponents. CL favourites.
I am still not convinced about letting Adama out on loan until we make a decent signing. Adama is amazing players, needs to play with squad.
@BarcAddicts well U seem to be a player. Well said. That's why we appreciate those passes which messi makes. Fantastic vision.
I was more than happy when I found out that PSG has kicked out Mourinho. When we played against PSG I had realized they have strong team.
I watch #EPL games quite few times &amp; honestly I am frustrated to see that ball is in the air more than where it shud be i:e at players feet.
Hope we knock out City comfortably, without any heart attacks &amp; Kick all the EPL fuss out of CL.
#EPL is most competitive league because most teams play at same level, that does not mean they play at a high level. Its just physical game
Wtf is wrong with U Messi. Why so many Tattoos lately.? Neymar U better stop influencing Leo.
@ErGaurav10 finally some good news from U
We r so focused on what will happen in Clasico, we forget That a bad game Against Eibar will mess up the Clasico even before its played.
#Motivation is often underestimated &amp; believe me #SelfMotivation is the best kind of it.
Chelsea out today would be nice, but that's not happening I know.
Game against Eibar is going to be tough. We play away, without both regular fullbacks, No busquets, Masche &amp; Mathieu 1 yellow for suspension
Schalke just sent us a warning that we need to be at our best against City. 1st goal is going to be priceless for who ever scores it.
@ErGaurav10 this will End like 'we dont care, we have la Decima &amp; 32 Ligas I guess.'
@ErGaurav10 I will b in Satara since June. Hope to c u that time. W,l play.
Best quote of @RayHudson "How do u measure somebody that could balance a balloon in a tunnel on a needle? Because #Messi is capable of that"
Chelsea's B'Day today. No better day to pay tribute to the buses &amp; declare this day as the The Bus Day
If I am right Januzaj shares his B'day with Ronaldo.? Legacy
2008-2012 we felt Messi has nothing more left to improve, scoring at that rate. But then what do we call the Current Messi now @RayHudson.?
goals 30-1st
non-penalty g. 27-1st
out of box g. 4-1st
hat tricks 5-1st
assists 14-1st
key passes 67-1st
…
Bloody Amazing"@barcastuff: Image: Football before and after Lionel Messi #fcblive [by @xusbadia via @barzaboy] 
The Kind of Form We r In &amp; the way Madrid r playing (fighting, Pointing out, Shouting at eachothr) I really want to destroy them at CampNou
Kind of Game #Iniesta played yesterday is what we need from him In the Clasico. His good game brings superiority to our Mid.
After the win yesterday, next best thing was watching #Xavi &amp; #Iniesta play together after a long time. When they both play they play great.
@champ_ian haha.. When he is on the edge of breaking any record he smashes it with a hatrick always. How predictable He is My God. <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
@ErGaurav10 No option or better answer, rather poetic answer would be I can even play football on water. We love that game. Don't we.?
Messi's 3rd Goal: He beats 2 Players with his 1st touch, fakes the shot leaves GK flat on ground, then from a tight angle slides it in
Lol Messi I have lost words for U. GK look like some dancers I front of him. What a presence of mind he has to trick GK aswell
Alves may b horrible with croses, but he is Messi of Nutmegs.
Ok Now messi score one Messi Level goal n make us forget the earlier 2 lucky ones.
Thiago should come for evry game. His Dad is scoring some Lucky goals in his presence.
What a fucking big relief. seems like I got my Life back. Seems like We won the CL. Seems like I scored at the Bernabeu.
Lol Messi better score this.
Now can I say we r safe. I hope so
Iniesta, Xavi, Mathieu All played well.
Respect for Rayo they have attacked the whole game &amp; not parked the bus for a min. Great team.
This is the class of Iniesta. But sadly he shows this class in glimpses now a days &amp; not on consistent basis.
Justttttt messiiiiii what a player mann
@ErGaurav10 there r stones I stead of grass. Its gas turned horrible
The way saurez finished it is how pure strikers do it &amp; Barca lacked this pure striker ever since etto left
@ErGaurav10 yeah that's our home ground. Just a bit edited to make it look green hahaha...<SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
Wow In life once I want to experience the atmosphere in CampNou, between those flags shouting out loud.
Ohhh just reached home in time for the game.. Hope for a good game. Visca Barca
@debasish_paul I to hope n wish n pray for same bro. And quite confident we will win today &amp; lead the table. #ViscaBarca
Few Things make U believe that U do much more than just to exist #Football surely. #Barcelona definitely@barcastuff 
@2girlcules Neymar is just catching Maturity &amp; Ronaldo is getting off the good age. So that's perfect time.
Lol no wonder Ronaldos Son watches #Messi videos on youtube He seems determined to b a better Footballer by learning it secretly.
My guesses r we will win the league at Vicente Calderon against Athletico this season, just like they won at CampNou against us last season.

They are barely on Tata's Barça level. Tata finished above them la…
2015 has done Barca some big favours. Better we respect that &amp; win the League &amp; Copa surely and CL &amp; WC including Cricket WC if possible lol
Wohoooooo...Wait All Barca fans should b happy after Barca win tomorrow. W hav a habit this season to help Madrid stay ahead.
@mdudheria ohhh yeah I missed that word. Thanx..
@Barca_Awan and then its us the Barca fans who complain why our fwds don't shoot more often. It's a funny world.
Athletic attacking even at this moment wen hardly 2' left. More Balls than Mourinho definitely, obviously, surely.
@messiness he does it turn wise. Jesse just came in, he gets his turn pretty soon
My Godnessss....Ffs Athleti don't give up like this way. Great shot by Bale
Last 10' so athletic r all out of stamina &amp; they have to be even more careful about conceding a Penalty. This is most likely situation.
Bales game is all like, push the ball in space wherever available, then outpace cheetahs in chasing that ball.But he great at it I agree
Post just saved RM ass. Brilliant save dude.
What was Ronaldo even thinking to appeal for that penalty. Habits r hard to go I knw. But dear that's addiction.
Athletic is attacking well, then next moment defending their lives. I hope they don't get caught on stamina this time.
This man William is having an amazing game. What a pace, strength and couple of absolutely amazing sliding tackles early in the game
Bale has absolutely done nothing. But u knw what that's even more than what Ronaldo has done
@champ_ian then be ready for a hatrick probably
@infosmessi haha well said.
Isco is brilliant man.
I appreciate and respect Athletic that despite being ahead against RM they r not sitting back and parking the bus. They r attacking well
Madrid is playing badly. But we all knw somehow they gonna get a goal or two. May b a penalty or Own goal whatever.
Ronaldo is a great Goal scorer. Keep that away and I wouldn't select him in my starting 11. No efforts to help the team at all.

I love you…
Lol that yellow card for Aduriz was a joke. Refs like a under pressure from whites.
Aduriz is a great player, apart from that cracking header his ball control is amazing.
Ronaldos game has dropped so much. He just waits for someone to pass him the ball, No tracking back AT ALL &amp;  frustrated lot of time
Goalllllll athleticccccccc...What a great cross n what a great finishh..1-0 to athletic
Watching the Madrid game &amp; Isco indeed has a great vision, he can easily be someone like Iniesta. I don't want Madrid to fuck his career.
Its a nice chance that Madrid drop points today. Hope Athletico Bilbao hold them or even better defeat them having home advantage
#WhatTheFuck we have a pre-deal with Juve for Pogba. I am not ready to believe this. If this transfer happens we will b close to invincibles
#ABdeVilliers What a player. Probably the rare kind whom nobody can hate, someone like #RahulDravid. Great innings. Well played. #WC2015
#ZindagiNaMilegiDobara #ZNMD still remains my favourite #Bollywood movie. May b becoz I too share the friendship bond shown in the movie.
@BreakTheBus Shit. That's not good news considering we have no Busquets for the clasico.
Btw does anybody knw if Modric will be available for the Clasico or not &amp; if so then will he be match fit.?
For the title we have to win the Clasico which we most likely will, then Win all the rest Liga games including Athletico away. Challenging
Ohhh man No... Busquets probably out for 4/5 weeks. Why? We hav a clasico in almost 3 weeks &amp; it's bloody important for the title.
#RangDeBasanti still remains one of the finest #Bollywood movies ever to have been directed. Hardly any such movies released in recent times
#Dhoni as cool as ever, this is osm. 10 Things Dhoni Said To His Players From Behind The Stumps 
Letting Alves go will b painful for us after all he has done for the club. But we should find a new RB we need him in our system
Part of me says we should Renew Alves, but then Truth is he has past his best &amp; we should find a new RB to make him ready in a season or 2
If we r not going to renew #DaniAlves we r going to b in crisis to find a replacement for him. No Matter what, he was once the best in World
@James_Hall92 U making me more depressed. Yeah that keys scene n the empty house, all of it was depressing.
Idk why the hell did I again watch the last episode of last season of F.R.I.E.N.D.S.Damn man I am depressed since yesterday night
Messi had very avg Game which by his standards means a bad game. He must have scored the easiest goal of his career today. He copied Ronaldo
#Rakitic is just getting better. #Saurez regaining his confidence. The only two positives of the game. Rest was Average.
Tho we won, but clearly Not a good performance by team. Anyways 3 points matter today
Granada were a better team certainly for 1st half. Hope we play better 2nd half
1st time saw the video of the song 'Brave' by #SaraBareilles &amp; loved it. Song is too good &amp; well done with the video.
In my City the moment u follow the traffic Rules, be sure Ur chances of meeting with an Accident increases highly. Stupid people.
@koushie_ Haha Against Rivals any spoon will do as long as someone eats them with it. I would even want an IPL team to beat them if possible
Yesterday #Saurez scored 2 good goals, But for me #Pique was clearly the man of the match. Brilliant, amazing, wonderful game by him.
#Pique I would have voted U for #BallonDor for todays performance alone
Not his fault !! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Anyone plzzz Ray Hudson stream????
@Joyeb123 Against English teams most probably Barca &amp; Madrid won't suffer. they leave a lot of space behind
Hahaha... What a goalEPL teams leaving this space wont ever fucking stop Barca. Saurez Hattrick please now
I still cant believe We lost yesterday.
@DoctaDaman yeah They all click at same time. Hope this changes &amp; some one becomes a saviour In crisis. Yeah today was a bad day anyways.
@jperkovic93 Exactly... His replacement is a problem currently, well but my point is we should take a step now to prepare a one for future
@Joyeb123 noooo. We have to win baba. Wishing U all the Badluck. Haha...
@DoctaDaman yeah Saurez Neymar Try for sure, but mostly its Messi who Assists them. Hope they do it on there own ever since here.
Playing Against City will be easy for Messi &amp; Saurez as they wont park the Bus. But also City will b a constant threat to our defence.
@Joyeb123 He will b available for clasico I guess. May b not match fit, but on the bench.
Problem is not us being dependent on Messi. He is the Best player out there in d world. Problem is No one else steps up if its not him.

Any coach and any team with a player like Messi will be dependant on him, you fool
I seriously don't know what to do about Alves. He sucks at defending &amp; Crosses but he is vital in many attacks that lead to a goal.
@Joyeb123 Yesss I knw that well. And specially after todays Performance at home I am worried about Clasico too + Modric is getting fit. Fuck
Ohhh man How much we r dependent on Messi. Madrid's not dependent on Ronaldo so much. They can manage to sneak one goal Anyhow. Refs fuck us
@Joyeb123 Haha.. So U saw this tweet. But we have to play Athletico away. Its the 2nd last game of season which mite decide the title.
Rafinha was our best Midfield today. Iniesta should not be given breaks, it hampers his consistency.
The fact that w play RM home is good, so basically RM just needs to drop points in 1 other game provided we win Against Athletico away.
League isn't lost yet ok. Ffs. Don't be so stupid. But yes we provided RM a lifeline to make mistake but still be the leader &amp; that's Bad
Such Games make it clear that Messi scoring goals is Important, but he Assisting one is even more fucking important. He is the soul of Barça
1 mistake frm Alves &amp; W got screwed. We better sign a new RB He WAS the best RB but now he is Average. I hate to tweet this but lets face it
Ohhh Iniesta dude what's wrong with U. U r no where close to ur best these days. Barca probably missing the combination of Iniesta &amp; Xavi.
We will help Madrid to win the league if at all they Win. I hate it even more. Fuckkkkk..
So a bad day for Messi is basically a Bad day for Barca. Back to where it was for last 2 Seasons. We need creative Iniesta &amp; Midfield ffs..
Something should b done about Liga refs. They fuck the game in bad way. Shitttt....
Thru out this season The refs have robbed is many times. Fuck this shit
So after so many years of having a glorified midfield this season w r struggling in that same area. I hate this.
Why we have to lose a home game only???
I was thinking we have finally got a way to break these teams who defend with all 11 like cowards shit. But not yet. Those useless Crosses..
Barca normally score more in 2nd half. I am hoping it we win now. Desperate man..
We r most vulnerable in early 20' of every game. One area where lucho needs to put efforts anyways hope we wake up.
The best thing about following a match on twitter is that u just impatiently wait for someone to tweet 'Goooaaallll' &amp; w celebrate like Nani
#StarSportsIndia Has messed up evry football fan. Seriously #Tensports network seems best for Football
So #Barca fans, how do u feel when u realize that #Saurez has to yet hit his top form. More joyous moments. I have huge expectations in CL
Neymar Scoring on regular basis has helped Messi to play freely without worries &amp; so #Barcelona r in great shape, Messi see's a lot of ball
The time since #Saurez has started to get into his grooves, #Messi has Scored in evry game heavily &amp; Saurez is nowhere near to his best yet.
#AnushkaSharma #Sketch #Drawing. One of my complete work. #Bollywood 
@i_am_sangi Ok. Thnk u.
@i_am_sangi Hey. Do u know if the movie Messi is available on torrents in English or at least English subtitles??
Haha a geometry class from Messi "@FCBNation93: Unbelievable by #Messi...

What a Goal luissuarez9 Absolute stunner. We all awaited for U to hit ur top form fcbarcelona 
Yesterdays performance by #Bartra was a glimpse of his great futureHe has a brilliant understanding of game. Also fearless In Attacking.
We yesterday played the game without our usual full backs &amp; it was a great performance from Adriano &amp; Montoya. This ensure our Squad quality
Yesterdays Goal, that Spectacular one is going to give Saurez a hell of a confidence. Just at the right time for us when CL is around.
My god. I can't believe what I saw
My Godnessssss....WHAT A GOAAALLL SAUREZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....FUCK JE DID A ROONEY WITH HIS WEAKER FOOT....
@mdudheria Have faith. U will
Opponents hardly get 4/5 touches on the ball and Barca win it back. What a brilliant game
Lucho did it perfectly. Giving Pedro game time to catch his confidence, he already is playing good. This will benefit us ahead...
@mdudheria haha.. I hope u change ur opinion.
Hahah I would laugh my ass out incase messi misses today
Pedro is a great player when he gets confidence. Amazing runs n quite good Dribbling once n twice. Also helps great deal in defending.
We r liyerraly getting ball back withing 5/6 seconds of loosing it. I cant believe what Lucho has done to us.
What a team this is. What a Game they are playing. Fucking out of this Galaxy.
#Barca r playing some beautiful Footbal. We can beat any team with such good game.
Why d fuck we r not shooting in front of the box
This Neymar &amp; Messi combination is literally doing wonders for Us. What brilliant understanding they have developed.
Btw praising #Messi is like U do it 1000 times in a game still U feel like U don't have enough words. This world is not enough for him
#Bartra is going to be a fucking brilliant defender who also has a good sense of attack. His reading of game is probably better that Pique.

#WC2015 #PakvsInd
Some one should tell pakistani Batsman that taking Singles &amp; Rotating strike is equal to breathing.India did it so beautifully. Maturity.
#IndvPak
So #India win the game comfortably.Now some #Barcelona time in 4 hours almost. What a day of sports.
I have great respect for Misbah. He alone stands as a warior, even when battle is lost. Great player.
@ErGaurav10 I know. <UNAMUSED FACE>
@ErGaurav10 Plan cancelled. Next time may be.
muze football khelane jana hai..

@ErGaurav10 Sadly only we 2 r there. Wait I,l ask again now that match is over.

#IndvsPak
Honestly Afridi could never have saved this game. Its was just matter of time.
Lovely. Beautiful memories &amp; the drawing. Great."@barcastuff: Drawing: Messi #fcblive [via @lex25van] 
What a scene at the #IndvsPak match. Brilliant. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
#DavidLuiz says #Zlatan asked him to leave #Chelsea.Haha #JoseMourinho is fucking genius at such tactics. He keeps a low profile perfectly.
@_WellOfCourse Haha well said..

Afridi: Kaise khelna hai ab?
Misbah: Inshallah boys played well it was bad day
A :Kya kar raha hai?
M : Pres…
So far a good day in matter of sports. IndvsPak. India will probably win this &amp; then Later BARCA game.#Barca win will make it just perfect.
Btw thing I have observed recently is Pakistan starts Well, then 2 wickets go down and then within a blink it's 5 down &amp; again tail holds on
Umesh Yadaw will turn out to be a brilliant bowler if he get consistency in his Line. His Length is quite ok.
To b fair it was OUT. One of the most slightest edge to be ever recorded probably. Game Over.
May b not out. But Dhoni is genius at doing such tricks
Dhoni should get credit of this wicket. Great captaincy. Hope now the downfall starts.
Not taking singles will be Pakistans biggest mistake today. Good job by our bowlers to restrict the singles.
Ok So Roger Federer is cheering India for a cricket game. Good.
#WontGiveItBack #IndvPak #CWC15
@barcelonist_boy Hahaha.... They might even try for Raina

-marca.  í ½í¸í ½í¸í ½í¸í ½í¸
This is fucking Interesting. Pakistan's Bad chasing record Vs India's Bad bowling Tradition.Lets see who performs to their best.
Considering Pakistans horrible record of Chasing this should be enough I guess. But then again Indian bowling neither have a good reputation
@mdudheria Yunis khan, Akmal, Misbah wickets will prove crucial. &amp; restricting Afridi for 1 over and he will gift his wicket to us.
Had Suresh Raina not performed. We were screwed. Good comeback Pakistan. But I guess we have made enough.
Haha Dhoni. What a shot.
Pakistan have given them a lifeline by they way they have bowled in last 3 overs
Noooo Rainas wicket will reduce score by 10/15 runs here.

#IndvsPak #WC2015 #BleedBlue
Hahaha #Dhoni whenever plays to his strength, no need for players to run. It reaches fence even before the bowler completes his runup
Pakistan always get wickets at wrong time This will bring Dhoni In &amp; Dohni &amp; Raina many times combine deadly to washout opponents #Indvspak
Indian bowlers need to figure out now itself the plan to ball better &amp; not let this match slip.  Anyways Dhoni can handle this I guess
Raina can miss time a shot, but still clears the boundary.
Haha Umpires r behaving like Liga refs. Blind.
Lol this guys r showing no mercy at all &amp; there is still Dhoni to come out yet.
Raina call pull out a 100 from here at this pace. He is a dangerous player who comes in with canons &amp; not Guns for the Game.
I told U Pakistanis will regret that run out because that brought Raina in very early. He is a Nightmare in death overs.
#Kohli is going to rape many records in his Career. I BET.
Haha Raina celebrated Kohlis 100 with a punch in air. Wow that's a good sight. #Indians
#Kohli man for big occasions what a player he is. Pure class. Now the stage is all set, Kohli &amp; Raina should go all guns out...
That's the way Rainaaaa....He will be Lethal if he goes on. Great shot.
Not at all good the way We r batting for last 5/6 overs
India have wasted this Powerplay.Kohli ffs play for the team score &amp; not the 100. Not expected this at all
@ErGaurav10 I don't remember that 4th. Anyways Hope Kohli gets 100 which sachin cud not 2 times almost
I wish #Raina stays there at least for next 10 overs &amp; he will get India beyond 325 with ease. He needs to play his normal game.
@Joyeb123 easily they will crush them, don't worry bro.
Last time in WC Pakistan dropped #Sachin 3 times. Today they have dropped #Kohli twice already.
@Joyeb123 Yeah it will b great contest. Actual test for barca
But trust me If #Raina gets going well, Pakistan will regret for this run out. Because more time Raina gets more destruction guaranteed.
@Joyeb123 haha Our own Pique he is.
@argentinewizard Badluck... Lol guess the scene had Kohli got out due to Dhawans bad call.. Specially in WC game against Pak
Hope now #Kohli does the compensation for his bad call. He has to not only get a ton but a big ton now.
Fuckkkkkk.... Not run out plzzzz....This is like own goal.
Pakistan Bowlers r struggling who r actually a better bowling side than Us. Hope our bowlers perform better under lights.
If #Raina &amp; #Dhoni gets such platform to bat In last 10 overs, they will absolutely destroy evry bowler in the world. Waiting for the feast
@mdudheria ok. Don't wory.
#Kohli has all the class there is in d world to bat. He needs to mature as a player who can control his temperament &amp; he'll be next #Sachin.
Haha #Afridi, Anushka Sharma seriously didn't like that.
This Pitch is looking like an Indian track. No swing &amp; Indian Batsman r performing without any worries.
When #ViratKohli performs, #India wins comfortably. So this game is just drifting away from Pakistan.
If U speak of Class #ViratKohli is the one who comes close to #SachinTendulkar or #Dravid.Best batsman today in the world.#IndVsPak
Ok so look like game is over &amp; this is where Ronaldo will come in picture now. May b score a tap in or penalty &amp; celebrate across the globe
#ArseneWenger had a perfect solution, when he said #Diving should be punished after the game That would reduce diving significantly #Ronaldo
#KritiSanon my recent crush. Man she is really really... Everything. cute, beautiful, sexy, Awesome...She definitely has a bright future.
@sureshchouksey8 Haha Lucho has 2/3 Goal scorers not just dependent on Leo + He made our defence perform better. This is so good for us
Considering the injury patch for RM, this is their best time to drop more points. So Athletico is still in the race for league no doubt.
@sureshchouksey8 yeah hope so we play the same way we played them this season and the same result when it will matter most.
About Cricket WC #IndvsPak wont be same excitement without likes of #SachinTendulkar vs #Akhtar. Anyways Hope India maintain the record
@sureshchouksey8 I meant Athletico Madrid. Isn't the 2nd last game of the season vs them.??
The Fact that this season we are having more than 1 regular goal scorer is the reason for our great season so far. It happened in Pep's era
If I was Lucho I would ask Alves to defend more than to attack because we can use Saurez now to attack from right. He has Class to deliver.
For our CL success, Using Mascherano tactically in Mid &amp; later in defence for making attacking substitutions will b the key.
Btw It would be foolishness if anyone still withers away the chances of Athletico winning the league.
Last season Athletico won Liga at #Campnou. This time #Barca have a sweet revenge chance. 2nd last game of season &amp; We play Athletico away.
The Clasico surely is going to be a big game for this season but lets not forget we have to play Athletico away in Liga, the season decider.
I am sitting in my Finance class and my teacher sounds like half dead &amp; I am all but thinking about time when Saurez will hit his top form.

Eduardo Galeano (Uruguayan Writer): “I like Messi, because he doesn’t think h…
@mdudheria well I better hope not that he moves to Madrid. He is really amazing player, may not b a goal scorer.
So Hazard renews contract with chelsea for more 5 years. Well that's Chelsea just ensuring huge sum wen RM sing him aftr trophy less season.
@barcastuff @BleedBarca
Its been for past 5/6 games that Barca score back immediately within 2/3' of opponent scoring. Is that a blessing ??
Passing and Crosses show the class of Saurez. W need to b patient with his scoring. They will rain when he starts scoring once
@fiazhamsath Lucho should work on that area wid Alba. He is great while attacking, just needs the last final pass/finishing to improve.
Lucho must be concentrate on best midfield combination that would help us before we actually start CL campaign on tougher scale.
Defensively we r good this season, but we r not the best in business. So midfield in better shape will ease defending. And its must for CL
Actually the way our Attack is performing leaves me without worries about the result, so all I want is a better Midfield performance
Today Villareal will b more dangerous as they knw, win today will b their best chance to win the cup having no Barca &amp; Madrid teams in final

Well from tomorrow I,l have my clases since 6am in morning upto 9 fucking Pm. And all I am really worried is about my cellphone battery.
@AddictedToGOAT haha I still believe its a Barca fan with Madrid logo saying that. Bcoz its been like forever I haven't seen such madridista
@K_Blaugrana Their Admitting just reveals they r not ignorant, because it was never really a question. No one comes near #Messi's radius.
I always knew it and waited for time when Barca would defend better with great GK support. Its time we hunt those titles back now.
@Dtikitakaqueen <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT><WEARY FACE>
Happy the way Saurez scored One touch shot from the edge of the box. These r moments that get the confidence back rather than 5 Tap-in goals
@Dtikitakaqueen haha that's the case in almost every game. Barca wake up only after few heart attacks in early 15'.
@pwoper_Cydonian Same pinch. Hell.
@mdudheria A medal for U for those brilliant words. Passion, ofcrsee...
There one thing in football That Messi still needs to learn.ASSISTING HIMSELF. That's the only way his amazing passes wont be wasted.
@mdudheria Haha how similar The football fans supporting same team think, specially of any plot against the rivals. They r always high btw
@mdudheria U running a Campaign against me boy.? If perez finds out this tweet, we both will b banned from watching football, trust me.
Once in a while Barca fans should watch other teams play, May b Liga or EPL. Trust me U will love Barca football even more than before
@BarcAddicts Absolutely agreed that Wen u watch other teams play, that's when U appreciate Barcas smooth touches &amp; passing. Treat.
@mdudheria Haha....I guess they r already In to ashes after yesterdays game &amp; tweets. Let them rise to see themselves fall again in clasico
Well Its so high time that people actually realize Messi is as good with his passing as he is with scoring That's why Barca depends upon him
@mdudheria btw I meant Bayern &amp; the better Madrid, Athletico Madrid. Now that's a confidence
Seems like Messi is going to make 2015 a hell of a year for him. Scoring Goals &amp; Assisting as if its a joke.
With such kind of Attack I am ready to face Bayern and Madrid together..
Messi scores and makes it sure that Ronaldo doesn't have a 4rth B'day party. Carlo should be thankful to our man.
Almost early 20' of each barca game r threatening to Barca. If we don't conceded early we have much better remaining game
@anuragkashyap72 @sanketutd
Just met a new species today he must be 21/22 and didn't knew who #EmmaWatson was.I walked away before he could use any of his super powers
A mightily important match day for Barca. We better not let this chance go to cut RM to 1 point considering yesterdays favour by Athleti.
@mdudheria haha. True that
@mdudheria bt Wat I knw damn correctly is #Puma makes worst design for Footbal shoes. Cesc always had horrible shoes in the squad.
@mdudheria &amp; exactly opposite in case of shoes. Nike &gt; Adidas

It’s the fact no penalties were given to RM. 

Is that even allowed, @LaLiga?

@sanketutd U better do it that way.
@mdudheria indeed. He has done wonders for Athletico. Winning the league where Madrid &amp; Barca play isn't a fucking joke.
@sanketutd u knw wat the way Casillas conceded 1st Its was U &amp; Man United that I thot about, actually felt sorry about to b honest
@mdudheria when it comes to defending ONLY Ramos is good defender. Lets give credit to Athletico and their fans. Great victory.
Btw can some answer me if M.Utd have Renewed #DeGea or notWell leave it any ways RM will get him even if u tag him for 50M
@sanketutd U will not like Casillas performance today, U have ur own reasons being a M.Utd fan I knw.
Ok now to b fair this wasn't strongest RM team. No Ramos, Marcello.So even the most costliest team suffers without defence.
Ok that's job done by Athleti for Barca. I just hope we don't screw this chance now.
Haha it seems ref is determined to reduce Athletico to 10/9 players.
@mdudheria yeah.. Ofcrse
@mdudheria haha u just marked a territory for Him. Inside the box. Let us be more specific. Inside the box, on that white spot, he's deadly
In big games I would even prefer a 1/10th #Messi rather than having a luxury of playing 3 Ronaldos in my team.
U knw wats worse for RM fans that their team is performing bad just aftr transfer window closed down.They r never patient.
I just hope we don't fuck up this opportunity tomorrow and better get a win any how.
No wonder ref is contributing somehow. if not by awarding the penalties be it by not giving the one which r legal.
How did Barca beat Athletico?Well they had Messi Not Ronaldo &amp;They had Neymar Not Bale.Hope it stays so.
Really Ronaldo's over all contribution to game leaves me without doubt that Scoring is very much Overrated in his case.
@FCB_Cule_1899 haha don't u remind me of Moyes boys.
I am feeling so proud n happy about the way Barca have defeated Athletico 3 times this season. W r in for the CL race May b
Ok so now a penalty sure Coming for RM just to preserve some Sentiments in the derby.
Haha M.Utd fans need to worry with the kinda keeping Casillas is doing.These white cunts gets who ever they want. #DeGea
Hope the refs don't spoil this Madrid Derby.
Draw or RM loss any would do for us. This is best chance RM can drop points
I still feel mad about Luchos decision for resting Neymar &amp; Messi against the Moyes boys might just cost us the season. I hope not.
If RM drop points against Athletico in next game, The Clasico will become the season decider only if we r able to beat Athletico away.
What a play, The most amazing goal scored by #Iniesta. This one never hGets old. Beautiful.  
@ErGaurav10 Ofcrse Rafinna is amazing talent. I just read Barca interested in Pogba or Isco the other opt. So just tweeted my view.
@ErGaurav10 Isco is quality He can b next Iniesta if gets proper help &amp; who doesn't want another Iniesta in team besides he was a Barca fan.
Lol that would be osm if barca r really interested in Isco. He was a big Barca &amp; Messi fan before joining RM.Figo will be keen on this news
Yes Lucho ur doing it just perfectly. Xavi would be best substitution in the world at this moment.
Its bonus that Barca actually have Mascherano. Lucho has used him perfectly along with Busquets. Lucho U got credits for this.
What's up with Barca, we r making good comebacks recently. It's really good.But I'd prefer not conceding at 1st place.
One thing about neymar that great goal scorers have is He is at right place at right time. These r good signs. Barca Needed it
What Messi did Alone for past seasons, Neymar is doing with him now. Thank God. We r in safe hands.Still I am great about Saurez scoring.
Saurez doesn't make me miss Villa.Doing the offside job perfectly.
We r already potential 4 points behind RM. We just cant fuck up more. Gotta win this at any cost
I knw this happens when one team misses easy chances again n again the othr team scores from no where. Curse. That's it
So Pique what r having after Milan, Paris may be?? Or a country this time.
Earlier people Use to look at Messi as a Goal scorer, today he has just Changed the whole perspective. He's the one to makes the Game work
If doing lots of Nutmegs would bring problems for Neymar, well then Messi would b a name Unknown to him.Meanwhile Alves winks at Cristiano.
Any team needs more than 1 Goal scorer. We had Etto, Villa, old Pedro Partnering wid Messi &amp; we did Wonders.Now w have Neymar. Even Better
Thank god barca r winning, or I wud have kiiled Dani for his evry cross...Wait I shudnt call it a cross
@mdudheria haha people live by their reputation they build. He build his own, &amp; U knew his.
@mdudheria ok U being Sherlock Holmes now. Qualified.
If Ur saying Why Neymar, then plz keep this in mind we need Saurez to get more playing time, to get his confidence back &amp; we have this game
@arjunsomal Okayy.. Good Evening then.
@mdudheria Its would be his Character and love for playing the game that repels him. Gravity is  someone's else excuse.
Plz don't take Saurez off. He needs more n more time to get his touch back. Take Neymar it would be good to avoid injuries he's bit fragile
@arjunsomal Yeah probably He,l leave when he,l b even better than now.Btw U up so late??
@arjunsomal I don't feel he,l leave.No way. Btw U have worries about Ur GK being of some interest for RM.
@mdudheria no they wont. For sure.
Haha After seeing a bit of unfair physical fight, Lucho says wait u all bast**ds I,l get u some hard man.Mathieu ready
I say #TerStegan is going to b a Legend. German GK's
@mdudheria its so pleasing to Neymars performance this season compared to last one. Same will happen with Saurez even in this season itself.
@mdudheria yeah sure we all will. We r no any team I white.
@mdudheria spot on dude.Its so pleasing to see a player who performs for the team and not his name. Saurez has completely done that. Salute
Teams suffer more against Barca in 2nd half as they r tired running behind ball &amp; 10 men make it worse. Hope now we dominate completely.
@mdudheria of course. He just needs to adapt his game to b able to create an impact with lesser space. He ain't getting same space as in EPL
Now just imagine, Our Midfield to the high standards that we had in last 6/7 seasons, with Messi concentrating only to score.Helll haha..
@mdudheria thank U.Saurez will join sooner, sometimes to score the messi assist &amp; later time to provide an assist. He is world class too.
This season Neymar has learnt to use the ability of Messi's vision by improving his finishing.Deep breathe.. Saurez will shortly do same
This is wat we missed last season. Neymars final finishing. Messi has the same game, just That Neymar is making use of that genius this time
Haha we thought Neymar will take pressure off Messi. Instead its vice versa. Messi keeps defenders occupied leaving Neymar ample of space.
Alba is a machine. Just running up &amp; down the whole 90' &amp; not just headless running.I cant think of any human who can do like that.
Calderon easily one of the toughest stadiums to visit in Europe. Lets win it guys...
One very bad thing about holidays is that they just fly away with a speed of like 263791038 mbps.
#Modi has spent enough time with #Obama roaming in garden Than I would ever spend with my Gf in my lifetimeI meant Future Gf with clause IF
Its natural that Barca score more in 2nd half, bcoz opponents get tired out running n defending in 1st Hal, they lose concentration later on
This kind of performance makes me happy. Great overall in 2nd half specially
Well that was Bartras second assist to Messi for the season
I am so pleased the way Pique is playing. Disciplined, focus, no stupidity.U see, when defence performs good, attack gets better.
Messi is just magic. No less.What a control, what a finish.I have lost words for that Man.
Neymars finishing was what was poorer last season. This season he is for barca what he is for Brasil along with Messi by his side. Deadly
Messi Neymar together r going to do wonders for world of football.
Seriously this season there has been no limit for penalties awarded to Madrid. May b genuine penalty, or a wrong call or a fucking dive.
Of course. It had to happen.Penalty again to save their asses.
Wtf Bradford. They lead against Chelsea. That too at the Bridge.
Ok so now Real will play better as a team without Ronaldo. Not good actually for us
Lol hope the ref doesn't lose his job aftr that red card.
With Saurez &amp; Messi, both who can attack from right wing, I would certainly ask Alves to be more defensive. That wud make us defend well.
What... Saurez turns 28 today. I thot he was already like 29.That's one good news he entered in his so called the best patch of career.
@i_am_sangi haha.. It means Don't forget that someone in this world is living for U. May U go anywhere don't forget that...
@i_am_sangi which song.???????Ur Hindi is good if u haven't done a 'copy-paste'
@SenyPitICollons a draw. And barca go through based on yesterdays results.
#Mascherano is the crux of our amazing defending record this season. He is a brilliant reader of game, deadly with his sliding tackles.
I Appreciate #Pique for the way he has lifted his game up. Still prone to few mistakes, but hope he keeps perfecting his game.
The way #Barca is defending lately actually gives pleasure to watch the game. Surety at back and magic up front.
@i_am_sangi felt nice listening those words.
@i_am_sangi u seriously make me realize how famous Bollywood is outside India. Trust me I had no idea.
@i_am_sangi no place for Messi &amp; Bartra??
Whatttt....We can sign a player, just he has to wait until Jan 2016 to play. Hell that's one big news.Change of plans big time.
Just saw That scene of little Messi meeting Antonella 1st time in pics..Haha pizza it has to be...
@2girlcules by that logic he's gonna score again at 55' &amp; 77' haha..

Cristiano's son is loving this.”

loool <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
My fucking goodness.. This is what keeps #Messi above #ronaldo. He would have won like 10 penalties had he gone down. He stayed up &amp; Scored
Best part of yesterdays game was that Perfect chest control by Terstegan of the cross &amp; passing it to a barca player.German keepers <OK HAND SIGN><FACE WITH OK GESTURE>
With recent clashes between Bale &amp; CR7 chance of Reus joining RM after Bale is set to leave is hugeRonaldo, Giving more reasons to hate him
Fuck it. I don't want Reus playing in that white shirt. Not after Modric &amp; Isco who were also Barca fans.Plz NOOOOO....
Shit. These expectations always hurt.I knw it will be eventually for Good, but still it fucks the moment
Actually started loving Antonella even more since watching her yesterday at the Gala. Cute + Hot. That's rare to carry both these features.
Btw winner of Ballondor was declared almost a week before. So I was surprised the Way CR7 reacted after announcement of his name.#Oscar
Logic says #Messi should get rest, then brain says Fuck Logic, I want some happy moments in the game.
I want Adama to at least get 30/20' of playing time vs Elche. We have to make someone ready who is physically strong asap for the future.
This FIFA Is a joke.
Neuer Has THE WORLD CUP + LeagueCR7 has CL + no. Of goalsMessi has WC final, WC best player + no. Of goalsBut CR7 has Real Madrid. SIMPLE
Lol ppl say #Messi needs a world Cup to be Greatest in History &amp; today WC performance will completely be neglected when CR7 wins #BallonDor
Having #Iniesta back to his usual genius is such a fucking good thing for barca. He eases the ball forward with those pick pocketing moments
Still happy about the way #Barca played yesterday. Good game in evry department by evry single player.&amp; #Iniesta showed glimpses of Genius
Against Atletico, he cleared 8 aerial balls in the area.
Excellent game in general. 
Real Madrid beat Barca
Atletico beat Real Madrid
Barca beat Atletico 
This is football
too amazing to be described.
Midfield making itself count today

Everyone played a…
1. Messssiiii 
2. Ney, Pique
Certainly Saurez is far better team player than just a Goal Scorer &amp; now He releases pressure off Messi who is more deadly with team buildup
I am getting that Picture. I am fucking puting it as my Dp. Saurez Neymar &amp; Messi
That whole move started due to exceptional brilliance of @SERGIOBUSQUETS in the last quarter part of the pitch. What a player he is
I stoped breathing for 5' almost...What a Game. What a performance, What atmosphere#ViacaBarca
FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKjjkflwhwndlalxjcjsjakfEjeokfjjnwkfkfSn hav owldwkq Nyk sldnFjdovorowjwn
I am shivering. God help us on set pieces plzzzzzz...
When r u going to make the subs lucho. For God Sake players r tiered. Get fresh strong legs.. Get Bartra in for Iniesta and let masche play.
Great game. I am enjoying except the refs fucking decisions
Jordi Alba is our Saviour so many fucking rime in every fucking game.
I,l kill ref if they score now.
Messi has amazing presence of mind. Brilliant in all situations.
I am literally laughing at that fucking ref. Always fucks up with our game.
What the FUCKKKKK..That worst than a Ronaldo acting. So minimal contact and he goes down.
Brilliant challenge Rakatick...
Haha Messi still wants to play He so loves this game of football just like a Kid trying to search for d last toffee even aftr eating up all
@BarcaMatchworn @AlFadhel75 its all getting better for us. Just hope we win the Liga this time and hopefully fight for CL
@BarcaMatchworn @AlFadhel75Yeah instead of affecting the team badly it's has just made them work together. Leo has a solution for evrything
@AlFadhel75 Yeah Lucho has a big task, but now that finally our top 3 r in the mood, he needs to just handle d Mid &amp; use mascherano wisely.
Now we need to defend solidly beco Athletico will be going all up against us. Defend as a team &amp; leave the scoring/assisting to Messi.
Messi is just so Vital in evry move.We r like passing ball around and then wen He gets the ball, suddenly the blood pressure rises..
Finaly Saurez Messi &amp; Neymar r performing together as a team. Midfield back in form and we will be a hell of a team
Happy &amp; proud about barca's performance. Didn't allowed Athletico to get a grip even for a minute.Great team game including defending.
My frnd will literally kill Mata now.
#Gayle is a monster. He can even hit a Six by waving a broomstick.
Even ur own twin is different than you!!
Cesc &amp; Sanchez already have done wonders, even Lord Song is playing good. Well m getting scared, more bids in coming years for Our players.
@JenFCB Mathieu is not in the quad I guess. Same line Up with Bartra for Mathieu will be perfect.Mascherano as CDM is just must today.
@jperkovic93 other areas U mean DEFENCE. Haha.. That's so so true. But now lets hope we get best of Saurez now.
@jperkovic93 yeah he had finally adapted to our style, but getting in Saurez would have kept a talent like him on bench.
@jperkovic93 Sanchez wasn't a player to suit Barca style. He has speed &amp; Barca hardly countered. Feel Happy seeing him doing wonders in EPL
Sanchez is same as he was at barca, difference is that he gets more space in EPL, fucking more space &amp; with his speed &amp; skill that's a gift
#Sanchez that was a beautiful goal.What a impact he is having in #Arsenal. An assist &amp; a goal so far.
#World would be happier if every individual decides that his/her actions won't harm or cause problems to others lives. U see its #Simple.
I always believed that Whatever happened, was all for good.Recently my teacher added to it that whatever will happen, will also b for good.
I replied Hazard is great talent, but having Messi in front of Cesc &amp; Hazard on other side would be Anal, He said NO.I changed the topic.
My friend is a Chelsea supporter,&amp; yesterday just said that, Chelsea doesn't need Messi as they have Hazard to SCORE WHENEVER they want Lol
What Jose couldn't do perfectly, Ancelotti is doing quite good in managing The Madrid's locker room.
I wud prefer Bartra &amp; Pique to pair up in todays game &amp; Mascherano as CDM. We have the potential to score, need to defend strongly
After all these speculation about Lucho, he not good enough, too strict.. I cant imagine d scenes if he takes Barca back to peps level
#Saurez is a world-class player. He will adapt sooner to #Barca style than Neymar did. By the time we just have to defend better.
#Barca can be so good this season we don't depend on Messi to score We have Neymar &amp; Saurez nowJust need Our Midfield &amp; disciplined defence
I kinda like Adriano as a player, never complains about being benched every single game, knowing that he,l play more in any othr team.
That Assist was a complete joke. Impossible.If Alba keeps improving his finishing with his weaker foot, Barca Will have a Bonus.
Luis Enrique has a task, to focus on Albas' finishing, improve it &amp; I tell U Barca will score more becoz of Messi passes to Alba.
Trust me due to his Alien goal scoring ability world has completely not paid attention to Messi's vision of playing Key/thru passes. Insane
Ohh Messi U just broke many Chelsea hearts with that kiss to the crest and fans. But 1 st U broke CR7 heart by scoring from his home.
makes it 2-0 for Barca
@2Cules1Account His finishing is world-class, he just needs time to adjust In tight spaces In Liga.He ain't getting free space as in EPL
@DoctaDaman Thank U. Seems like he read my tweet and immediately adapted.Lol..
U see Lucho players like Neymar &amp; Messi even if they miss the training, its not like they forget their skills to play football.
These many Assists of Saurez clearly shows the class he hasAll he needs is to adapt his free style to play in tight spaces in box &amp; score
Haha.. Saurez Must be like, Yeahh 1 more Assist to my credit.Stupid Rest world be like Saurez is a flop at Barca doesn't score.
Its so crystal clear Barca is suffering due to Bad performance of midfield.
@Dtikitakaqueen they will get tired aftr 60/70' that's when we possibly score more.
@SocialBarca_10 U do not get free space wen U play with style Barca plays due to lot of possession.That's y Alexis had lesser impact here
@i_am_sangi U should sleep. Its good for health. Try it. <FACE WITH STUCK-OUT TONGUE AND WINKING E>Gn
@i_am_sangi we all.Anyways Morning <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@borrachera1111 English plz?
@i_am_sangi We will being at CampNou is advantage.
So Athletico won. Not a time to b happy barca fans, w face them next in Liga. And w need to win cant let the gap to be 7 between us &amp; RM
Haha...That hot sexy Gf of Cesc, is still trying to tempt Leo &amp; Antonella to come to London by posting some awesome pics on Insta.
Now that this Barca circus has calmed down, I just hope not that #Messi opens his twitter A/c and starts following Chelsea again. Crazy
@Aani_Fatima absolutely yes.
#Messi when this all #Insta shit calms down. Just remember U don't have a Twitter A/c yet.Just sign up &amp; ask thiago to follow ChelseaFC.
@Aani_Fatima U said U hate her, U said she is Ugly iys ok. U r a girl.I have to say she is hot. Damn hot to divert Leo. Lol..
I had decided to study &amp; that's was almost 2 hrs before.But this Messi just is not letting me do it. What a fucking DICTATOR
@i_am_sangi Yeah we know that no doubt. But Lucho doesn't knw this, &amp; that's the problem.U should be one of the board members. I vote.
@i_am_sangi btw u just made me realize this chelsea-Messi rumor must have really Pissed of Ronaldo, looking at their Market Value.
@i_am_sangi No surely not aftr Chelsea see ur Maths.
@ShirleySetia Help me to choose.What's more beautiful. Is it Ur voice or is it simply u.?Ur gifted &amp; U know that.
@i_am_sangi lol ur funny Rest barca world is fighting between Lucho and Messi &amp; there Ur doing MathsGreat 10/10 show it to CR7 to piss him
@Aani_Fatima hahahaha...U seem to have found out the exact cause of this whole fucking chaos.Yes its Cesc &amp; his GF manipulating leo.
RM is trying to copy us into the chaos! Cute!
World must be thinking Barca coach benched Messi for 1 half &amp; he got sacked Ffs. Thank God it wasnt d whole game, he must have been murdered
One of my good Madridista frnd said Messi should not leave Barca. Clasico &amp; Liga will be pointless.Me: He ain't going anywhere. Calma calma
Result: 
Barcelona lost.
Zubi sacked.
Leo Messi leaving.
Enrique in trouble.

We shoul…
Besides 17 diff. Line ups he did a big gamble in Clasico by not playing Alba &amp; informing Mathieu just minutes before d start that Ur our LB.
Lol it's funny that Moyes is responsible for all this. Even though I don't knw how it ends,I think We should Thank Him for this cleaning up
@OffsideLiam yeah I agree with wat Fregie said, but this isn't any player, he is debated best in history &amp; clearly Barca is avg. Without him
Lucho managed 17 Games in Liga with 17 diff Line ups. No that's clearly not the way to manage a big club, Now U see the results.?
@Areea2 Actully I think she is the root cause. Lol U got this one right.
@campnouballgirl nah nah... Mujhe roh khelna hai, besides Messi..Not a sports director, hope ur not like Lucho, so put me in the squad.
@Juve93Cule what Messi? No body is training today.Lol they have a day off today. Hope for tomorrow.
PIQUE - "When Puyol came on as a substitute after his injury I said "Welcome back" He shouted "focus on the game."
It deeply hurts to see that #Barca have shifted from creative Midfield to just Possession midfield.We were The #Messi of Midfield area <CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE>
@BarcaLens Spot on.
@BarcaLens Yeah have to give him the credit, he is a genius. Getting his cards right.Lol and a defence that can head properly is bonus.
@BarcaLens they r trying to be emotional fakes rather than seeing the reality.
@BarcaLens I had never ever even dreamt that RM will come out so strong after losing Dimaria and Xabi, probably their Back bone.Krooosss <THUMBS UP SIGN>
@BarcaLens yeah of course.Wish them on ne half too.
@BarcaLens that's wide open to all wise fans. Messi makes Barca special, He saves our asses every game. From scoring to building up attack
Virat Kohli bhi kya ukhad lega when U ask to fight a war without cannons, without Guns not even Swords but kitchen knives#AusVsInd
Sometimes twitter Football fans come up with brilliant ideas for their teams, Board members should really 1's consider them b4 taking a step
@BarcaLens "Good Morning Madridistas" ???Well there was no need to wish them, they r already having awesome time seeing Barca in a mess.
@Nikomarvel He is never ever going to take his shirt off (Even after scoring a penalty) he wants to impress by his Footbal &amp; not his physic.
@campnouballgirl if this is going to b Ur policy, I Vote for U surely <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>
.....i swear i'll discuss everything with the fans before taking a step <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@shantanuagr but I tell U it was all fun yesterday that 1-2 hrs of twitter wer amazing. News after news just popping up.Hard to believe one
@shantanuagr lol U missed huge shit.Zubi gone, Puyol gave up, Lucho about to go, Messi liked Chelsea on insta, fucking lot of drama
@campnouballgirl that's indeed emotional stuff. So much happiness and excitement was there during those days.Wish we have it back sooner.
Lol this word 'Moyes effect' is really fucking heavy.Loool.. look what he did by just playing Barca once.
The board condition, the transfer Ban for 2 windows, Puyol leaving, lesser of trust in lucho, Barca performance..Well what more I have to c
All happens for good.Yesterdays loss boosted the Zubi set back.Hope wat I hear is true. Zubi is out.Time for changes to start in.
Unless our defence doesn't get reliable our Mid wont do its job perfectly &amp; so the fwds will have to do the Job of midfield.All interlinked
I am worried about our midfield.Yeah I knw we have Iniesta, but.. <CRYING FACE><CRYING FACE>
Lucho: "we were a bit unlucky"WTF.
Morning. I am sitting in the class, and still pissed of about luchos fucked up team selection that cost us a golden chance.
U don't win games based on the goodwill of the team in recent 6/7 years. U need to play to ur strength of the squad #Lucho
@argentinewizard Lol Lucho has just pissed all the Barca fans. What a chance we had to win and cut the gap with Madrid.Just fucked up all.
Evryone thought that Lucho being a former player will solve barca problems.Shit. this makes Pep even more genius than he already was.
And for the final time time ffs Munir &lt;&lt;&lt; Sandro. If u wanna start a B player be it Sandro and not munir.Shit..

*Starts Munir and Pedro over Messi and Neymar*
I don't knw wat hurts more.We lost or we lost golden chance to close up to madrid or we lost by Own Goal, Or luchos fucking brilliance???
Messi and Neymar r individual talents Lucho. Training Less for 1/2 days doesn't fade their talents. U of all should understand this.
Give Mascherano the captains band, ask him to shout out at evry fucking player like Puyol did.This might be our plan B
@AddictedToGOAT Pep didn't win every game becoz opponents outplayed us sumtimes. Not becoz of his stupid decisions to rest both best players
We already have a shaky defence, now the whole world know that, and then Lucho benches our best attack form.HOW THE FUCK U EXPECT A WIN.???
Midfield is big issue. Iniesta is out of his normal touch. And the rest mids r busy defending and stoping attacks rather than being creative
I feel sad that the threat Barcelona use to create in the minds of opponents is no more the same. Not even half.
How can U not score with Neymar Messi and Saurez in ur squad.?Well ask Lucho, how to get the shit out of the best.
Today was a golden chance considering RM lost earlier and also the fact that we play Athletico next week.Lucho I wont forgive U.
@Neymaring This is doesn't need patience. Playing away against most bad opponent history wise, and U bench ur best players. WTF WTF WTF
I wanna hit some one badly. Very fucking badly.Lucho U cant manage This Barcelona aide in this fucking way.Very poor, wasted all 3 Subs
Madrid is seriously going thru golden patch of being lucky. Getting penalties for free, dives and all. And Wen they Lose, Barca lose too.
I had hopes on Lucho.But it seems he is trying too much. He wants to show that he is beter than Pep becoz he dares to rest Messi.Fuck off
Never going to forgive Lucho for todays game.Who the hell would bench Neymar and Messi wen playing away spcly aftr golden chance to go up.
Now just hope that Barca don't fuck up this chance of cutting the gap to 1 point.Plzzz U need to win today guys.
@SocialBarca_10 mascherano Has to be there at any cost. 2014 he has been a beast.
For the 1st time I am up before the Alarm strikes. Looool &amp; it has to be a Sunday.This CA course is changing me.
I cant thank #Music &amp; #Chocolates enough to save my life so often.Best thing that happened to this world after Football
With the Squad Barca have they can compete for Liga. For this we need to play all big games only to win them. Without dropping easy points
Thank U @sanketutd for this greeting with those new year wishes.1st of my #Barca Greeting card. It's lovely.#Messi 
@barcastuff match timings(global) for tomorrows game plz.?
Chelsea started the second half of the season the way Cesc use to play at Barca his second half of the season
This games DVD will be running for fucking 17375 years. I bet
5 Conceded by Jose Mourinho. Only 2nd time after Barca scored 5 against his Madrid.
@CatalanKings10 That's how it should be. We should use Saurez to Attack from right and not Alves.
One of the best Quotes'Best way to love is to make other person feel free about Ur Love'Only a few will understand it to core.
Cesc 13 Assist.!EPL suits him its more an open play He has quality to split defence with his passesI bet #Iniesta will do wonders in EPL
Never want Chelsea to win EPL, to be specific, don't want that man Jose Mourinho to win it.
Even if U put me in #Paris or #Vegas without my #friends, not a moment I am staying there.I even enjoyed the School with friends.
@sanketutd Wat else, passing some absurd comments while few girls were passing, and laughing their asses out. Had a urge to Kill them
@i_am_sangi ohh.. ofcrse U will, ranbir was there.Btw it was nice.
@i_am_sangi yeah a combination of good music, good script, good actors is rare, very rare. The Last I remember was #ZindagiNaMilegiDobara
@2Cules1Account Even though many r just lost in history itself relishing the Franco days.
@i_am_sangi Yeah as we know, Bad films make one of the best music.This song is indeed good, Almost all other songs from same movie.
Just saw few Guys (20/21yrs), the country Youths, who wer doing their best displaying their cheap Mentality &amp; feeling proud offFfs bastards
@i_am_sangi as I expected..
@i_am_sangi btw listen to this 'Sooraj Duba Hai Yaro' a new song from the movie #RoyArjit Singh at it again
@i_am_sangi lol.. no no no..Boys aren't. Just ask a girl to luk back and smile. job done.Don't even need to do anything spcl.
@i_am_sangi all Girls r beautiful everywhere on earthBut so are they complicated, Not easily readable, confusing..&amp; 1 wrong move, its over
@i_am_sangi I shud?? Ohh yeah since 4/5 years I shud gave.U r a good motivation. I,l try.
@i_am_sangi better I start with Someone from India 1st, or say my city, or my class...Hell that's difficult.
@i_am_sangi haha that's best answer u cud have givenLol I too have a big list of my fav's I need to meet. Where shall I find Selena Gomez ?
@i_am_sangi but he love ya Katrina.Lol sorry...
Just fucking amazing"@FCBRoyal: Tic tac tic tac 
#Maakasam if I was able to maintain the seriousness I get at some point about something untill I achieve that shit, I wud be already a CA
2/2 Today barca doesn't play bad, but opponents have got the way to reduce the impact by defending wid bus &amp; barca don't have strong plan B
Peps Barca did wonders because that style of play was new, perfected by him and Players, which opponents took time to find solution for 1/2
@IAmOffside Few players r hard to fit into our system which involves Creating a beautiful goal more than just scoring a goal.
@Aani_Fatima yeah forever..
@Aani_Fatima Lol sometimes a Substitute for PUC, vehicle papers, NoParking zone.Indians r indeed best for multiple usage.
After seeing all EPL fans tweeting football, for me Twitter seems useless without Barca games.
Lol best caption I evr read"@jperkovic93: "Mom! I need money"
"Ask your dad!"
"Dad! I need money!"
"Ask your mom!"

@jperkovic93 hahaha...Lol that's best caption I have read for this video or say any video <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN>
Ohh.. this Winter is getting so on the nerves, as if it has its Exams tomorrow.
@ShirleySetia I just love Ur voice, Absolutely amazing. And ur expressions for this song define cuteness
Now that #Pedro is playing good its time that #Barca watch him go and see him doing marvels at some English team.
Controll the ball, spin around &amp; shoot with ur weaker foot &amp; score, but best part comes later- Celebrating with whole team.Simply #Messi
Lol #Messi is a joke.Plays every game, plays all minutes, plays at Same level (Messi level), almost scores every Game.Certainly not human.
As #Zlatan said there will b some serious problems if #Messi started scoring with right foot.7 of his last 8 goals r right footed. Problems
Lol.. Barca is winning 2-0But still everyone wants to see Messi score atlst 1.Really it isn't a #Barcelona game if #Messi doesn't score
Saurezs 1st touch made it possible. Strikers who are great goalscorera have a class apart when it comes to 1st touch.
Having both fullbacks as attacking ones #Barca has restricted the creativity of midfield attack, as they focus more on not loosing the bal.
@jperkovic93 problem IS we don't get extra time untill we score n win.We don't get gifted Penalties.We r punished for wrong offside goals.
No matter how long we have travelled on the wrong road, We can always turn around.#GreatThoughts 
@Bad_Luck_Barca may b barca is trying to keep dongou away from world market by not playing him in A team.Next season he,l b A team player
@andressoto493 may b barca is trying to keep dongou away from world market by not playing him in A team.Next season he,l b A team player
@Bad_Luck_Barca So very true.I feel even Adama should be given more minutes.Hell yeah we r going to come all guns blazing next season
Btw I would prefer #Sandro over #Munir to be in the A team if we had to choose only one. He brings in pace and his runs r too good.
'Life is fair, because its unfair to everybody'Read this lines somewhere &amp; found them so true.
@CuteCule ohh thank God at least someone on my TL understands that Lucho is trying things to fix the best possible one. Good reading.
The fact that #Pedro is scoring is great, we need a Sub who can mark an immediate impact on the game with limited timeFrankly, fuck the bus
@CuteCule oh.. I never doubted Lucho and his Tactics. Just wanted a stronger defence to execute it to perfection.
@FCBRoyal Thank U. That's surely gonna be lock screen image. Thank U again
@CuteCule Yeah. Lets hope we get our glory days Back. I just wanna beat the Shit out of Real like Pep and his Barca did.
@FCBRoyal Ur Dp/Icon <THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN><THUMBS UP SIGN> worth  receiving an award. Can U plz just msg me that pic of Leo.
@CuteCule I have no idea about that. But we better get a good one becoz Alves was the Best RB there in his prime. He helped us win Titles
@Alain_XY Hahaha.. Bang! Spot on.!Shakira wont allow Pique &amp; the rest world wont allow Bartra to spoil the Looks.But I hv hopes on Bartra
@CuteCule We wer all focused on getting a good RB seeing Alves in last patch of his career.And agony is that w will do same next season too
@GreatCule we missed out a big time on Marquinhos, I knw. Hope Vermelan makes his injuries worth a wait next season
@CuteCule Barca wer so desperate that they would have even played Messi as a defender this season. So #Arsenal did great job here.
@CuteCule lol we went to England and got #Vermelan.I thot we will b a bit safer now, but then Injuries said hello...Haha
@CuteCule I don't knw how we gonna replace Our LionOthr option is getting a more defensive RB, bcoz Alba is never going to stop his runs
#Busquets has lost his form.? No.He is just helping out defenders to defend, rather than being reliable on them and play his natural game.
#Barca won #Treble x2 times, Spain won the #Euro &amp; the WCPuyol was the defender in all casesWithout him both r suffering#Defence = titles
What #Barca Need is a Strong defender who doesn't care about his body getting hit by any force. That will help the Mid to play its role
#Adama is such a beast. New gold from the #LaMasia mine.He is going to solve our problem when it comes to playing physical game like a Boss
I wait for the era when #Bollywood will shift from money making to making some meaningful films.Certain directors need to quit their work.
Feel so sad to see the fact that maximum #Bollywood movies r only n only entertainment shit. That to senselessly running successfully.
So @barcastuff is back in business. That's good.
@AmitabhBachan Sir, its Sad that the simple thing like #Unity still needs to be seeked after getting punished heavily several times.

Irony also die…
Getting stuck in a traffic jam in #Leh is not bad at all, get out of the vehicle and then just do this… 
@sanketutd no. Why
So what was AC Milan for past years for barca, Its 
@emanleomessi Wats up with this @barcastuff suspension..? I mean Why.? Who?
@overreactcules haha that's literally a joke. Is he a 2 year old kid? Or I think must be a fan girl surely
Aftr watching all the #Saurez action yesterday I am not sure that was he dying to score his 1st or was desperate to Celebrate the way he did
#Messi has not even hit his so called Peak career patch in Footbal which is suppose to be 28-31So That assures a thing, #Aliens live longer
#JordiAlba has to be in the team even if he was just 2ft tall. His pace sums up evrythng else. Quite clear from yesterdays game.
Good Game = Good Night = Good sleep.Gn Twitter
@Madridista_AFG @CatalanBaller @FCBarcelona nope we aren't interested in History. Tell to ur kids as I said before
Lol evrybody wants Arsenal in the knockouts. Haha...
@beudeker @Madridista_AFG @CatalanBaller Yeah but this time its not Ronaldo to cry for. So voting wont reopen. Or it wud be Messi hands down
@Madridista_AFG @CatalanBaller ofcrse voting wont be reopening like last time which favoured ur Barbie doll to win last time.
@Madridista_AFG @CatalanBaller There's a 5-0 Then there a 6-2 then there's a 3-4 and many more in Barca favour. Don't jump off now plz.
A year back nobody would have dreamt that this is going to be the goal scoring chart in a single game-  Zlatan, Messi, Neymar, Saurez
@mdudheria that actuly gave me satisfaction seeing Saurez score.
Hahaha.. actually messi assisted Saurez without even touching the ball
Ibrahimovic
Messi
Neymar 
Suarez 

Feels like an allstar game #fcblive
I am at peace now. Fucking InnerPeaceThank U #Saurez Thank U #Barca
@Madridista_AFG Hahahaha...Sleep boy sleep, U,l have school tomorrow. U need to feel ur friends the History. Sweet dreams.
@Madridista_AFG Do U even knw Little Kid that how did ur team win their 1st 5 CL cups..????Ohh common u knw shit about anything.
@mdudheria Ohhh we have been waiting for that for last 2/3 seasons.Better our defence start playing at higher level.
@Madridista_AFG hahaha such an immature fan U r. No doubtNow go google their career Goals &amp; assists &amp; trophies.U,l come to knw who's dady
@mdudheria U should have waited to tweet this fact. Saurez has yet to wear his scoring shoes. More such goals to flow..
@Madridista_AFG Keep telling History to ur Kids. Don't forget to add History about Dives, Penalties, Franco.
Barca should be scared of one thing today. #Penalty. Becoz PSG is wearing that shity White colour.But then again they have no one to dive
@Madridista_AFG U r probably a new kid in this world. Bale just did beat 1 Player with his pace messi scored beating 5 Madrid players in CL.
@Madridista_AFG Dude do U remember when Messi fucked ur team as if a school team For so many no. Of times. Get lost.
We would have been in relegation I guess had we not renewed #MascheranoThat was the best decision this season. Gave us air to breathe
Btw #Neymar that goal was one for your Youtube collections. Shove it up the Haters.Brilliant.
Our Attack is such a brilliant one. Proper and Puyol like defending would make us win a Treble, I wish we defended just a bit better.
Dont knw about rest but one thing Neymar has learnt from Messi is to silence his critics on the pitchAnd yes haters he doesn't dive anymore
That's the X factor Saurez will provide. Have patience he is back aftr 4 months, cant score everytime he shoots.
Didn't play Alba in Clasico our defence suffered. Iniesta got no help up ahead.And now we repeat same idea. Why?We r dependent on his Pace
We r playing wid 3 Defenders and even then defending so night. Want U guys expect, as if we r playing wid Puyols n Maldinis not to concede.
Idea of not playing Jordi Alba itself is worst ever. He is must becoz if his pace. Cant count how many time he saved our asses on counters
Mascherano is Must in the starting line up not as a CB but CDM. He needs to Stop their attacks with his brilliant sliding tackles.
Only if Dani Alves had the pace and stamina like Jordi Alba he would have been defending 100 times better than he does now and so do Barca
When #Messi plays good, we witness a #Barca playing Pure &amp; magical football.Happy to see that the Barca we wanna see is getting back.
Woke up early morning, almost at dawn. Went for Finance classes &amp; found that its a holiday.Yeahhhh.... Back to do wats best, Sleeping. Gn
@ErGaurav10 read this, Apart from who should win it and why which is subjective @JenFCB  has done a great job.
Conclusion is subjective. But just brilliantly put by @JenFCB.This is wonderfully written.
lol says alot :) :) :)
@akshjjw confidence is they key wen u join a new team. Look at neymar last season and this season, so much better.
If ur saying #Saurez needs to work on his finishing then sorry u really don't knw a player saurez is.He need to adapt to small space runs.
Lol if Messi was wearing white today the fan that threw the bottle wud have been banned from watching any live games
Busquets hope this goal brings ur lost form back on track..Wat a dramatic end god....
J Cf aj few di ysjqvsjflcoskshshsjslai ref red bdjfksgfwgebeksostgdkwjwvwhwFuckkkkkkkk..... Messii bless u busquestsssssssssssssssssss
The ref is the only reason Barcelona is not winning. #FCBlive
Better have a anti-Crossing clause if Barca gonna extend Alves contract, or the CampNou will protest
Bravo god bless U.
Fuck this ref. Wrong off side decision and again #Saurez with no luck absolutely.
#Neymar us so brilliant sometimes with his trickery that U wonder was that #Ronaldinho on the ball
I am so disappointed looking at Busi this season. He is no wer near to his best. I hope this bad patch passes away asap.
@SubahAhmed we have to. We will
@SubahAhmed Absolutely lost. Not a single good planed attack.
My goodness Alves Ur crosses r worst than maths
Not at all good by barca. Hope 2nd half is better
Hahahaha m just laughing that #Pique got the yellow out of no where. Now our both CB's booked. Brilliant.
What a cunt. Bloody fucking hell Valencia players.
Shit saurezzzz...
@LeoNeyReus its harder  if ur a barca player. Ur not allowed space by the bus
This looks like a tough game for barca. We gotta score 1st or it will be worst
Its a dream one day to visit this home. To cheer, To shout my heart out, to Celebrate the emotions, To… 
@ErGaurav10 I have no idea wats it about. Cant imagine the situation if one women driver is teaching othr to drive.
There's a Women's car rally today in my city. Bloody hell Cant imagine the traffic chaos they r going to cause.No wise man will hang around

One of many pics of tonight's game. Brilliant gesture by the team #Messi 
Lol even if #Ronaldo keeping a nick name for #messi was false report Now he seriously must be thinking of actually calling him a mothr#*#@*#

@david_07villa by letting it all out on twitter. The dance, the shouts, the mad acts converted to insane tweets.Going on for last 2 hours
@CampNouBallBoy @ChrisJunkFood haha yeah rival nations assisting each other to create history. Great story
Neymar assisted Messi's record goal.
There r retards in every corner of world who say #LaLiga is poor enough to make records but hardly will accept the quality of #Messi.
@tumzalicious That someone U know will never ever be as great as Messi is.
My friends supporting othr teams often say Barca worships #Messi &amp; no one else.I don't have any explanation becoz they don't have #Messi
Hahaha.. This guy breaks an old record of being #Laliga top goal scorer at just 27 and celebrates as if he he did nothing great. Modesty.
Did U realize that #Messi scored a hat trick without penalties, He broke the legendary record but he did not remove his shirt to celebrate
Lol today #Messi did not break the record but he absolutely smashed and crushed it.
@mdudheria yeah. These r early days.Those 3 together r going to mark an era Just a mater of time, ofcorse if that bloody 'Goal Post' allows
How the fuck Is it possible thAt Ramos and Pique duo haven't conceded a single yet against Germany..
@mdudheria Ur rply made me just to think about it for a sec.Hell no it was for fun. No way scary. Never ever.
@onyemadonald What he shud be silf..???Sory That's not football whatever U r watching then.
@mdudheria hahaLol just hope that they don't keep on saying U take it, no U take it, bloody hell no U take it, For the fuck sake U take It
Yeah just realized #Auguero should have started. Its Old Traford he is playing in. <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> If U knw what I mean.
The way Messi is creating chances lately is going to be a feast for Saurez, neymar has already started to feast upon it.
Lol he is trying hard to be a hero..He never knew what a team game is.

Because 2009, 2011.

If Argentina win: "Ronaldo has a shit team, so?"

If Portugal win: "Oh, Messi is clearly shit now."

PAHAHA…
#ViratKohli just doesn't knw to give up. This 100's while chasing the target r the ones that matter most.

That explains why he's only one…
Frankly I am not satisfied by Busquets overall performance. He was brilliant against Ajax. His standards r too high playing with mastro's
I want city to win. Chelsea going up too far will switch of the interest in league.Btw EPL is always fascinating in respect for top 4 spots
We will be just unable to tell other people the greatness of players like #Xavi #Iniesta #Busquets..It needs to be Seen ONLY
Mascherano whenever is found guilty of defending it's all n all because of a defender who's short, or else he is a beast.
Without Xavi we just dare not to defend so high on the half line.No one can control the Mid as he does, so easily we get caught on counters
#Saurez: At Liverpool he scored many being main striker.Here he is assisting more because he plays with Neymar an messi.That's Quality.
#Mascherano: Thanks for being there.U have been absolutely brilliant this season. Giving ur 10000% in every game.
Saurez this is what U have to do.Thank God for this break.Now we will be more confident..
Lol wen Alves plays we blame him for his crosses.. But without Alves attack is weaker. He is a threat for opponents
Literally this substitution has brought some life within me.
Now its fucking tough to score 2 goals without conceding a single, spcly when their attack is so fast.W cant compromise with 3 points.
I thought this line up will help us test our depth. But Quality is too low when we don't play our full squad.
Rakitic should step up his performance. We r used to Xavi's dominance in mid.

Players like Adriano and Montoya haven't played much but never complained, they are players as well, and players wan…
@clicketyyclick infact it might help us later in the game. Neymar &amp; Saurez coming in together Those fresh legs might just kill the opponents
@clicketyyclick bang. spot on, about that fans thing.Really feel sad about it. But we trust the team that plays, all r willing to give 100%
@clicketyyclick Yup, no problem about benching Saurez but Neymar should have started.Cant let 3/4 Players mark Messi alone.#ViscaBarva
Ok I should stop trolling Pedro.I really wanna see him score at least a brace today.Its must for barca and damn must for him
Wining this game will give a lot of confidence as to we have a good and trustable backup..Ok Pedro will win it for us..
Benching #Saurez could have been understandable, but benching both #Neymar and Saurez isn't anyway.Hope Pedro wins a World cup today haha..
Lol... Whole of twitter barca fans r shocked n outraged Hope we manage to win 3 points.We need it badly.
These r no more those old days wen Barca &amp; even the world was sure before the game that #Barca will win.We have to get back that reputation
Shuffling the team so much, in an away game, when we desperately need 3 points...I don't knw what should I say.... Blank.
I loved this pic and its editing. Superb click. #Messi

@mdudheria Solution...
Make a decisio, any one of it.
and then Messi will Adapt to it.
he is such a genius
@mdudheria Perfectly said. nothing Nonsense. and passing Under pressure is just gods gift to busquets, even in our penalty area.
WTF Aguero booked for diving..
lol the criminals roam freely outside and earn penalties and someone else pays for it
@mdudheria He stops the opponents attack, along with Masche. and he then distributes the ball ahead.
under pressure defending is brilliant
And again we witnessed that..
when #Busquets h a good game, #Barca have a good game.
#Alba well played.
Messi and Saurez will link up quick and better than Messi and Neymar because Saurez doesn't have a habit of holding the ball like neymar.
Chances that Messi miss now a days r tons. Even then he scores out of some where. Insane.
@Barcatastic Only my 2yr old Nephew can do that.
Pedro even if u score 1 Own goal today It will be forgiven, for ur that legendary assist.
The initial 10/15' of 2nd half Barca moved the ball so well that switched off Ajax. Since then We completely dominated them.
So finaly Adriano is fit..Good to see him getting some playing time.He is Vital in any team due to his ability to play with both feet's.

He is 27. What a legend. 
#JordiAlba &gt; #TheFlash
Can U believe it #Pedro helped Messi to equal the record.He will be remembered just like Alves says he will be too.
#Messi #71Hey #RonaldoHii #RonaldoHows U #RonaldoOn the Television #RonaldoHaha...
Dani Alves and Messi combine so magicaly many times. They r like use to each others next move too.
That's what speed and swiftness of Messi does.Invitation to foul him or sit back watching him glide away
Bloody hell...Never in my life time barca will allow me to be relaxed while they r dealing with corners and crosse..
Mathieu is a strong and brilliant defender. But Jordi Alba is forever a better LB than Mathieu can become.
Bartra is calm headed wile passing.Its a blessing for a team having such defender with good passing ability.He will be tiki-taka defender
Dani Alves can probably play better cricket than he can cross..
Ter Stegan at this age is passing and playing with ball so good and confidently is actually pleasing to see.
Good start to final half. Confident one
#Puyol U should travel to every away game with the team. No matter where U sit in the crowd, it still motivates our guys.
@ThanaaForever10 hahaha...Do they even come out of their holes to react.Anyways great keep enjoying.

the good news is we're leading despite being shit
Bloodyyy hellll...This ref has lost his brains.He is breathing out yellow cards.
Lucho has been bold enough to start Bartra by benching fit Pique. That got the dividends.
@ThanaaForever10 I don't knw who the fuck hates Bartra.I mean U actually have those kinds on Ur TL. Sad.
Haha..&amp; with a Header #Messi gets equal to Ronaldos tallyAnd trust me #Header is most important word in the tweetThat will Hurt. Deeply
Credits to TerStegan for immediately releasing the ball and leting the play continue...
Lol...#Saurez is splaying at Dani Alves position and Alves as a striker.
That's the way to play #saurez.Take shots, U need not to wait to pass the ball, u r one of the best strikers in the world. Remember that
Someone tell me are we playing or just defending and blocking their shots.
Barca keeps luring the ball around opponents penalty area for a long time. This allows them to get stable and mark all the player running in
I hate it wen barca stops their counter run.When the defence earn the ball all start running and like stop suddenly aftr 2 sec.Why.?????
Masche booked so early. Shit.This going to affect his sliding tackles.He,l b more reserved before he offers a challenge.Fuck that ref.
By starting #Bartra Lucho has given crystal clear signals to #Pique that if he doesn't raise his game he wont b toleratedThat's like a boss
"@Troll__Football: The difference 
@lucasammr Aaanndddd that's what differentiates the Legends from the good ones.Humility, down to earth nature and peoples love.
@ErGaurav10 did it on fb.Tagged u in a coment..
@ErGaurav10 I,l try to find..
Saw that #Ronaldo and #Sterling incident from yesterdays game now..Hahaha... He forgot he was outside the Penalty area.
I use to think CR7's pace n speed make him to go down easily by a small contact with opponents.Lol.. But its not speed, its a habit now
@Ay_Vy haha.. That last line about pep. Spot on.
@ErGaurav10 clases for 6 months probably..
@TheAsifBaLoch I knw that wellI was just making his importance felt by adding messi in to the bracket.He is must for Barca &amp;Pique too haha
@ErGaurav10 mid Nov.But I,l b I pune since December <POUTING FACE>
#Mascherano has to be played in some how no matter even if U rest Messi for him.That important he is.
Win against #Ajax is must tomorrow.To get back to winning.To remain in competition for 1st spot in CL group.&amp; To ansr back few haters.
@ErGaurav10 hope not that U return n we all stop. Its almost sunset for most of us. Exams..
@ErGaurav10 since last month w r like playing everyday.Same time, same home ground, but just few new transfers..U should return to ur home
#Shadow of the #God..
#Messi10 
#ViscaBarca 
@ErGaurav10 they r going to stun the world. I bet.Its just matter of time, give them 1,2 more games and they will click together.
This song <MULTIPLE MUSICAL NOTES>  'Tu hi tu'..Herd it a 100 times, still loving it.Rare now a days.
So I guess now few stupid fans will say barca got the wrong striker from epl after seeing #Aguero score.
@i_am_sangi wait until they hit the post few times.
City have not yet scored. Ok#DavidDegea has denied them.Be happy city fans U have not yet hit the post 4/5 times to add to ur frustration
@i_am_sangi Haven't U seen yesterdays Barca game.Same story..
Haha..Yeah No penalties given today because all have been distributed to Madrid already.
@mdudheria a noble award for ur observation.Gn now.#ViacaBarca
Last tweet for the night.Ok then Let me make positive one, after the whole twitter is just outraged"We fall to rise back stronger"Claps <CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
@mdudheria They r linking up quite well. Its just bad day for finishing.No worries, they will make a mark that will stun the rest. Sooner
Ok jokes apart.Playing Messi, Neymar and Saurez together is going to turn out best attack ever.Just give time some time.
Some one tell #Messi he is still Messi &amp; #Neymar he is still Neymar &amp; #Saurez that he is still Saurez.Now convince me they played together
@jperkovic93 Lol I wanted our weakest part, the defence to changeAnd we changed the strongest, the Mid.Fuck Logic.
@mdudheria <ASTONISHED FACE> what..Ok. Then I guess we played with 2/3 Toress's &amp; Fred'sSame equation.
We r attacking brilliantly with speed and sharpness.Now just adapt to finishing it with 1st touch, headers.Be quick.Expectations- 24 Hrs.
Probably replacement for Dani Alves wont be a new attacking RB.We already got the missing piece of attack. #Saurez.Now get a strong RB
@mdudheria They probably played Buffon as their GK. Not sure. U check it once though
But Saurez did make his presence felt 1st by creating chances &amp; then by not shooting himself.He was sharp. He forced Dani Alves stay behind
Cant take it away from Celta though.Played pure #Footbal and not #Mourinho style football.And defeated Barca in Campnou.Gk Mom easily.
I don't knw to be happy that we r attacking with real pace or to cry that this pace has cost us our finishing.Probably w,l get use to it.
@i_am_sangi Their GK probably let all the Cats out.
Ffs don't blame Lucho.He did put the best available team.We missed chances like hell, GK was in form of his life &amp; yeah Fuck that crossbar
I was suppose to miss watching this match. Would have been better choice than seeing barca make me see missing chances in bits and pieces.
@mdudheria what anything.???Everything for sure
I don't knw what to say...I am just blank that we let go every chance and already that GK in heavenly form.
@mdudheria haha..My bad sorry. I was a bit emotional to give him a chance
Pique must be hating that crossbar.He already has a tough competition this season.
I have started to lose faith in messi's free kicks. Better he surprises me next time.
I am just amazed at Mascheranos game reading, work rate, sliding tackles.
Lol imagine pedro coming in and scoring 2 goals.#BallonDor
@clicketyyclick shit I almost forgot that. This is getting bad really sad.
Fucking shit. Blody hell.....Iniesta better start warming up.
I hate Liga refsToo soft. Always ready to play with the whistle in their mouthNo wonder #Ronaldo not ready to go to M.Utd
Today the post has defended well for Celta than Pique did in the last clasico
@GorkhaliBrigade U mean #Iniestaaaaaaaa
@clicketyyclick Iniesta coming in will help to lure the ball in middleBut I fear that celta should not aim at a draw becoz they r tired
This game has been between barca defence passing it to front 3 and they making and wasting chances.No fucking Midfield involved today.
Celta not parking the bus even when playing at #Campnou #RespectLove to see such games.
I don't knw why ppl r tweeting that w r playing bad.W r playing great just no proper finishing. Great attacking game so far.
@CampNouAddict finally someone realized this. Now a days Mascherano is our best player.Wish he could exchange his height wid pique

Somebody had to say it.This isn't the same Busquets that forced …
Watching the Clasico highlights.And I swear without #Mascherano in the team Barca would concede more 2/3 goals EVERY GAME.
Loss against Rivals is the worst one.The Clasico loss still hurts.Anyways this kinda loses makes the Revenge Sweeter.#ViscaBarca #Barca
And Now #Messi has his left + Right side to make assist.#Neymar has already done, now #Saurez will feast upon his assists.
@ErGaurav10 right now in bad mood.M just about to miss the 1st half I guess. Trafic jam. Stuck in Mahableshwar.
Defensively stronger, Taller.Attack probably the best in world.And Mid Just best trio.Perfect line up #Barca

This is so sad
@sureshchouksey8 not particularly this.But many other sick tactics r famous in that Madrid club.
@DonAndresFCB The way Pedro plays, forces Alves to play more attackingSuarez's game will give Alves time to play more a RB and not a winger
Ancelotti saying #Bale to miss the clasicoLol I fucking wont believe it untill the game starts. Very well m aware of Madrid's shit tactics.
Good that Rakitic starts today.Because I want Xavi to start the Clasico.Clasico needs experienced masters to control the game.
Fuck this reff....
I just cant forget that Messi Goal.Pure Genius. Just out of this world.That run, that finish.
Orgasmm to say in RayHudson languageI have no words to describe that Messi Neymar linkup. Thank You God for this kind of Football
Alves now that u have got an assist from a cross, whole of Barca hope u will be satisfied
#Messi and #Xavi just interchanged their roles from the run to vision to see that run to the chip. Everything just interchanged
Mascherano has just saved Pique's ass
#Iniesta in place of Sergio might have intelligently just owned the ball without getting hit.He is Iniesta.
Ramos might have scored that Piques header chance.
#Iniesta and his real importance is realised when he misses the game.
#Pique is going to waste half if his life raising his hand up praying to catch the opponent in Offside trap.He should Run instead.
This shit referring like this, Dives, cries for Penalty. ElClasico is going to be tough for Barca
Dani Alves for the Fuck sake don't cross again..
I am damn sure #Mascherano will sometimes forget that today he is a midfield player..
#Mascherano in mid will give #Busquets the rest he didn't get last season + better defensive performance
#StartSports seriously U suck with ur timetable.Bloody hell.
@ErGaurav10 Wattt...I didn't knew this. Good. V.Good
Lol every time I see this Kolkata playing it feels like its actually Athletico Madrid playing.Ok just due to those Red-White strips#ISL
@debasish_paul yeah I over reacted.In fact I was happy that Indian football is no soccer.Thanx for enlightening me. Haha..
@debasish_paul wtf..... <ASTONISHED FACE>Disgrace on me if I couldn't notice its Super instead of soccer being an Indian.Honestly didn't expected it.
@ErGaurav10 Ur being too good.That's not good n not necessary at all.
@debasish_paul trust me I gave a thought upon it twice, but that's how actuly the name is. Which of course is idiotic. Football is no soccer
@ErGaurav10 so finaly u caught up quickly n nicely on twitter.
@barcastuff #Messi banner in Indian soccer league 
#Neymar in such sublime form.#Saurez will be back hungry.#Messi at his usual best in #Bernabeu.#Clásico perfectly timed.
@ErGaurav10 plz find out any ways that w can give trials. At least w shud try.
#Iniesta just now once again did a INIESTAAAAAAAAAAAA..Off the field today thoughCongrats Don Andres for the awardIts pleasure watching U
@TheDutchCule Xavi should start. In Clásico Experience is must. Control the game for 60' then get in Rakitic to help more defensively
@ErGaurav10 no matter which team.I feel so fucking happy to see this massively improved quality of football in #India, that too so suddenly
@mysticdelta Hope U stay active here now. Football &amp; #Barcelona keeps me active here.U must find a sexy gal to keep U active if not footbal
#Xavi #Mastero"@barcastuff: List: Number of times a player has made 150+ passes in a match since 1 January 2010 
@mysticdelta how come someone like u is so late joining twitter..?
@akshjjw Might be his fan..
@ErGaurav10 U shud not ask this question so early..Logically it should be Pune, but cant ignore Mumbai too.
Ask #Messi to play in middle so that he can connect  with #Dimaria.At least they can work out one proper attack..
Its not working for Argentina all because #DiMaria &amp; #Messi r playing away from each other.U need to connect Ur best 2 Players Tata..
May be Messi should make an assist in 2nd half that's what his form says..
Hahahahaha....
Ohh boy Neymar..Ur not playing for Barcelona that U thot Messi would score that loose pass of urs right in front of goal.
It's time for Saurez to return and I don't want any fucking injury to messi or Neymar.Have waited so far to see them 3 play together.
Mascherano is best in reading the game. So unlucky that he is short and Pique is tall.
Ten Networks commentator just sucks. Breaks his silence after 2/3 mins every time.
@FranklinMbonu Yup. Sure. I do play. Everyday.
Not a single word from commentators till now. Now they speak aftr 15 mins.
@FranklinMbonu same here.Its the best thing on planet. Football.
@FranklinMbonu Surely hope so..
#Messi #Neymar Handshake..Actually should have happened in the WC.
How much love these Football players get no matter whichever part of world they play..
Tata Martinoo.....Good to see him
@sanketutd Barcelona accept proposal to share Liga television revenue more equally Willing to freeze income for 4 years. Madrid didn't agree
These Uruguay friendlies r such a blessing for #Barca right before the #ElClasico.Rare that International break gives such good outcome.
@RunGthS yup Tall players r must for setpieces.And #Pique should make an effort to jump while during clearances.
@RunGthS I think he should stick to Pique &amp; MathieuWe need tall players defending Set Pieces &amp; use Mascherano and Busquets alternatively
Untill I saw the #ISL preview I had no idea how big its going to be.Finally Some quality Footbal in India.
Just saw the video #Messi uploaded on FB.Hahaha.... He is still a child.A child who loves to play everything.
@IBreatheBarca What an observation.We surely r in race this season due to stronger defence.
@i_am_sangi I was just kidding...Anyways loved the songs U had suggested. All of it.Keep suggesting...
@i_am_sangi 'Probably'...????OMG zlatan in doubt. That's Not like Being Zlatan.
Today while playing #streetfootbal with friends My team had 2 Dani Alves kinda players, who only attacked &amp; We lost 4-7No Defence = No wins
Kind of Squad Arsenal have they should be happy for finishing inside top 4Feel Sory for them specially when once they were invincibles
@wiz_teem Not even Interested a bit.I love and admire football and not a particular player is greater than football for me.
#Ronaldo is in the form of his life..Would have loved him if he wasn't as arrogant as he is
haha #EPL fans..
#DiegoCosta Scored so many last season,
#CR7 is scoring so much,
#Messi scores every Game..
&amp; all this becoz Its #LaLiga.
#Saurez coming back will activate our right wing attack too, which was crippled due to out form pedro, this might just make #Alves stay back
@mdudheria Spanish players are short, they cant be stupid to play physical.
They have adapted and upgraded their technical play. #Wise
#EPL might be most competitive league in the world but Ur a stupid ignorant if U dont accept the high level of technicality of Liga players.
