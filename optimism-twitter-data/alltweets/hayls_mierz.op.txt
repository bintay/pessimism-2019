@sarahmarill that just sounds terrible like yes I'm sure you can find exact information on all of this? <EXPRESSIONLESS FACE>
@MrUnoriginaity Yes thank you

@cassiifowlie Ohhh I absolutely will.
Or play Age of Empires. Ya know. Same difference.
Today is a good day to sit inside, stay warm, and write poetry
@JonathanYourtee that's the plan hahaha
@JonathanYourtee he's notorious for it - he doesn't use our names, just calls us "Hartt" and asks if we're a real school
Last thing I wanna do at 8 AM is sit through a marketing class with a professor who hates Hartt kids.
This day was a gift in so many ways.

Me: I'll make your mom some instructions so you can make these airplanes.
Mom: You can have an airport.
Aidan: Or I can throw them at you.
Mom: What do you guys do all day?
Aidan: We go from room to room and make a mess.
Mom: No I can't take the big chickens off the shelf, they're too heavy.
Aidan: I can lift that down. Easily. (He's 4)
Mom: "Why are you spitting on the chicken?"
Aidan: "Maybe he likes it. Or maybe he thinks it's dirty."

@_DanielleWalsh Absolutely terrifying! Same to you, love! Next time I'm home we should do something!
@_DanielleWalsh YUPP. Good ol' Tyngsboro. I was so stuck I thought I wouldn't make it home.
@_DanielleWalsh Nope. None of the roads around my house have been plowed and no driveways. I was afraid I wouldn't make it up mine.
@_DanielleWalsh Some guy stopped halfway up the hill on Anderson and killed my momentum. Had to turn around and go back to Chestnut. Sucked.

Getting my hair cut like Tegan from @teganandsara tomorrow! Hopefully I can style it successfully! Tegan I wish I knew your secrets!
I think that The Fault In Our Stars is probably the best, saddest, most honest, and cutest book I've ever read all rolled into one. #feels
I felt you in my life before I ever thought to. #iwasnineteen #teganandsara #feels
I'm being that guy who starts the William Tell excerpt at 60 BPM and only increases my tempo by 2 BPM each time I play it right. #trombonist

Kennedy Center Honors, gotta love national celebration of the arts. Goodness. Such beautiful performances. #breathtaking
@LizBaldwin I'm sorry dude but I am just having the hardest time getting into Flatland...
Lied. I don't recommend This Is How You Lose Her. Ending left much to be desired... #disappointed
@rubychaffee If you say so, Ruby :P
Twas the morning after Christmas and all through the house, no one was awake so I got to read in quiet solitude. Plus my awesome mom. #nook
"I was staring at you and you were staring at me and right then it was sort of like love, wasn’t it?" 
@thads3 I suppose so! My nook makes it incredibly easy to tweet!
Barnes and Noble giftcard from my aunt! $40 to spend on books! Any suggestions? #obsessedwithmynook
@LizBaldwin Just read the intro to Flatland! Seems like it's going to be a fantastic read! :)

@stephielynn93 @GayGirlSwag Pretty valid, Steph hahaha though I don't know if I have gay swag, exactly. Maybe nerd swag. Or band geek swag.
@JeezeTricia Thanks Tricia! :D I miss you!!
For all y'all who didn't know, I am proud to announce that I'm a member of the first @BTWFoundation Youth Advisory Board! :)

#USWNT let's goooooo
You know it's gonna be a lovely day when you wake up with @allisonweiss stuck in your head.
I'm surprised. The blood involved in my first real attempt at longboarding was far less than expected.
Nothing like a night of Dual Survivors and @allisonweiss to end a lovely first beach day! #iwanttheoceanrightnow
@teganandsara Pretty sure my character would end up being the evil one secretly poisoning her father for his money. Valerie Killoway. Yupp.
Well hey, even my work computer, which I don't use for anything personal, knows I'm gay apparently. 
@JustinChan7 Look at him go! Commenting, commenting, commenting, for youuuuu #ding
@JustinChan7 Oh man, funny, I love you as well! #graceface

@wojo4hitz Of course :) You enable my obsession and you are a genuinely good person. @jennypeaches is a horrible, terrible human being.
@JennyPeaches Ever think that mayhaps what you do to T&S could be considered harassment? You make me sick.
@JennyPeaches You need to stop being ignorant and get a life that doesn't involve attacking people's sexualities. Especially Tegan and Sara.
@JennyPeaches @wojo4hitz Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Jaime is not YOUR name. You'll have plenty bad to say about me going forward
@JennyPeaches @wojo4hitz Practice what you preach. You are a horrifyingly ignorant, completely unintelligent person. Love you Jaime &lt;3
The fact that #LegalizeGayMarriage is trending makes me SO SO happy. It just needs to happen. Please tweet it to show your support for love!
14yrs in jail for supporting #LGBT rights? CRISIS in #Nigeria and we need your help by Monday:
