Thankful to be blessed with this little boy, I'm so grateful to call myself your mother <FACE THROWING A KISS>. 
Thanks Mommy and Carter <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è<SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD> #FirstMothersDay<SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> 
My baby is gone with his grandma <SLEEPY FACE>. This is my first time letting him go <PENSIVE FACE>.
And I'm just thankful that he has
And he's brought my family closer together, showed us how strong we are when we rely on each other. He pushes us all to be greater everyday!
But Carter came on God's time. He knew I was headed down the wrong path and I was down there for all the wrong reasons.
Sometimes my heart drops when I think of how life would've been had I not gotten pregnant and gone back to Coastal...
But my baby is sleep, so I must follow <VICTORY HAND>üèæÔ∏è<SLEEPING FACE>
I hate that tight feeling right after you get your hair done <WEARY FACE>. Lord forbid you had some naps and they combed the life out of them <PERSEVERING FACE>.
My sister so ghetto, she just started singing "you disqualified, shawty you disqualified" <FLUSHED FACE>. Fix it Jesus <WEARY FACE>.
Somebody make it stop, my baby is growing up so fast <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE> 
Been up since 5, still have stuff to do <WEARY FACE>. I need a nap first though <SLEEPING FACE>.
I can always count on Cart to wake up wanting to play, then leave me hanging to watch tv alone <WORRIED FACE>
My heart hurts. My mind is everywhere. I've tried to hold everything together and its all shattering right in front of me <PENSIVE FACE>.
@lovethroughME exactly like its the perfect size and stuff for me but I swear once I fix one problem something new is wrong right after!
@lovethroughME its Jeeps man, they so high maintenance <ANGRY FACE>
Something is forever wrong with my car <PENSIVE FACE>.
He loves the camera <CAMERA><VIDEO CAMERA> #MY<HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è 
My mind won't stop wondering why all of this is happening to me. I just don't understand.
Saw Blink out supporting their Louisville teammates <GRINNING FACE>
That "family first" shit just for show <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>. Me and Cart handle shit on our own and we do just fine!
How hard is it to find someone to give me time? Nothing else, just time..
Sometimes I just don't know what it is...
Out and about with my Wild Man <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><FACE THROWING A KISS> 
Bruh my lil brother be cheating like hell when he playing with his friend <WEARY FACE>
Back to the basics <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>üèæ 
Out and about with my cool kid <SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
I'm so stressed out that I'm just tired. I just want to lay in the bed all day and disappear from the world. But life goes on.
When you figure out you're just being used and all you feel is stupid and embarrassed <SLEEPY FACE>.
Dear son, I apologize in advance for all of this <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> 
I'd rather just hold my feelings in, instead of listening to bullshit logic and explanations.
Carter takes up the whole bed but refuses to sleep in his own <ANGRY FACE>
So do they know that some of their shields are upside down?
I walk back in the room from using the bathroom, this lil niglet laying there watching tv, going to town on his paci <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
Y'all see what I have to go through with these two <UNAMUSED FACE> #helpme #sillyboys 
I have so much to do, but Carter keeps pooping and spitting up everywhere <WEARY FACE>.
Shoutout to my mom though, she's my #1 supporter. She has my back on every decision I make.
But it's life, and there's always trials and tribulations. Just gotta roll with the punches and come out on top.
Finding a baby sitter isn't always easy, and I'll be damned if my baby end up on the news over a bitch not taking proper care of him.
I basically take care of Carter by myself, but it's fine. I understand that Cam is "grinding". Just wish I didn't get called lazy for it <PENSIVE FACE>.
Today was a major success, all thanks to the big man upstairs <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèæ
I can't have one fucking day of peace <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>.

That shit was hilarious <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>. I can't even give an "A" for effort.
<FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> I'm dying over here <SKULL> 
I was eating hard as hell, looked down and Carter woke up staring at me like "really nigga <NEUTRAL FACE>" and started smiling. I think we're besties now
I mean like, I am up, but how he know that? Lol he lucky he my best friend because anybody else would get cursed out or ignored.
Tee is the only person I know that will call me at 6 in the morning, and expect me to be up <NEUTRAL FACE>.
You can only reach out so much before you finally throw in the towel...

Carter doctor though <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>.
Shit get real when you ride your bike to Waffle House at 2 in the morning <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Everything about me has been falling apart these last few days <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
How the hell you gone give relationship advice when you don't try to fix yours at all? That's ass backwards.
Wish I had a car so I wouldn't have to wait to go to the doctor. My baby will be up and running soon though, hopefully <SMIRKING FACE>.
If nobody else got me, I know my little brother does <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>.
I haven't eaten all day, Carter has been screaming since this afternoon and I still feel like shit. So please excuse my pissy attitude <UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>.
As much as I want to rant, I'm not. This is not the place for that <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>.
Just because I refuse to leave my child with YOUR friends doesn't mean I don't know what I'm doing.
My partner in crime is two months old today <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>! He said he gone be turnt off his formula <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.‚Ä¶ 
If this lil boy fart one more time <UNAMUSED FACE>. I brace myself whenever I see him stretch out <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
@LeMarcusMartin thank you! Lol he definitely fitting in already <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
Even Cart looked at me like, "Ma, it's too early to be up" and went back to sleep <CONFUSED FACE>. He so fake man!
Why am I up <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>

On top of that, now I'm getting blamed for something that I didn't do <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
Really wanted to see Furious 7, but guess that's not going to happen <PENSIVE FACE>.
Easter <RABBIT FACE> 
I never do people the way they do me. But it's cool though.
Emotionally and mentally, I'm just drained... Like I'm done trying because obviously I'm doing something wrong.
It's sad when the only person to wish me happy birthday was my own son, and he can't even talk yet <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
Smh the fact that the ONE birthday plan I had fell through <PENSIVE FACE>. Fuck it though, I'll enjoy my day with my baby and make it about him.
All my baby wanted was his mommy to come home <RELIEVED FACE>. Love having somebody wanting to be with you, just as much as you want to be with them <HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è.

Hate when I have to wake my baby up for feed/change time. He sleeps so good and I do too <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>.
Change of plans, family road trip <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>

‚Äú@ACDB__: Seriously missing @JamieMercedesss‚Äù I miss you too <PENSIVE FACE>
I'm a cry baby, so when something doesn't go my way or gets fucked up, just be prepared to catch my attitude.
Why Carter wanna turn up as soon as his daddy leave <UNAMUSED FACE>
@OhSoOutstanding thank you Brandy <FACE THROWING A KISS>. I try not to let it get to me.
@love_last_ thank you! That's Mommy's lil man!!
I don't usually cry over shit like that, but it was so embarrassing I couldn't help it..
Then to put it on social media for everybody to see, not funny at all..
I've never been "small" or skinny but I mean shit, I did just have a baby. I've never just been happy with my body so to pick on me hurt <DISAPPOINTED FACE><PERSEVERING FACE>

Carter has been spending quality time with his LaLa for the past two days <RELIEVED FACE>.
Carter has no neck because we constantly picked on Nick for not having one <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

Only my best friend calls me to have a conversation while he throws up <UNAMUSED FACE><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Like everybody has had something they're not proud about, and that sent me past my breaking point at that time in life.
I hate when people bring up stuff that they know I'm really sensitive about <SLEEPY FACE><SLEEPY FACE>
So uncomfortable <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
They leave me home alone like I'm not due at any given moment <UNAMUSED FACE>
12 days left <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> #CSG #MyTank 
I don't really like dark sodas but when I do drink them, I prefer Coke to Pepsi.
Because a "black male with dreadlocks" doesn't describe half of Coastal's population <UNAMUSED FACE>.
Plus my siblings don't want me to leave until I have Carter. They're sad that I moved all my stuff this weekend <CRYING FACE>
Like I don't want to sleep in my bed because I just bought a new set and I don't want my water to break while I'm laying in it <WEARY FACE> #DontJudge
Stomach hurts <DISAPPOINTED FACE>
Like damn, I'm not a fan but at least give the team credit for actually putting in the work to make it back <UNAMUSED FACE>.
A lot of the reasons people don't want Seattle to win the Super Bowl has nothing to do with the team period, just the "bandwagon fans"
Told my papa I was just going to sit here and look pretty and he told me I'm doing good <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
@Queen_Ann14 omg yessss! <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> and it's always when you're sleeping good. Stupid ear ninjas.
I hate when the fan is on and hair keeps blowing into my ear. It's the weirdest feeling ever <PERSEVERING FACE>
I miss college. Mainly for the meal swipes.

night: drake
I want a dog, just so we can awkwardly stare at each other..
I couldn't roll over earlier, like I legit got stuck and nobody came to help me <SLEEPY FACE>
My bed just won't let me go this morning <PENSIVE FACE>.
A lot of my friends really think her name is Felicia, or call her that just because I do. I just like to annoy her <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
My mom likes to act like she don't know her damn name half the time <UNAMUSED FACE>. Knowing damn well she FELICIA from the block <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
I lied, I went to Wendy's like any other emotional ass pregnant woman would do. Have to feed my feelings..
I'm going to bed <SLEEPY FACE><PENSIVE FACE>
Cleaned the carpet and cleared the room, now time to officially start moving stuff <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Was told to take it easy but the way my life is set up, to some that's just a "bullshit excuse" to be lazy.
I always try to bring out the best in people. I honestly love being around someone that's genuinely happy. That's what makes me happy.
The only way I'll ever feel at peace, is if I learn to overlook the negativity that others attempt to throw my way.. Slowly but surely..
Packed all of Carter's stuff last night, finishing up mine today. Then it's just chill and wait until this weekend so I can get my bed apart
Only reason I'm glad my room is kinda small, takes half the time to do everything <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Gonna clean the carpet today <THUMBS UP SIGN>
Can't believe we only have 21 days left <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND SMILING>
Carter is getting his exercise on right now with all this kicking and moving he's doing <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I swear I have the funniest stories in the world but no friends to tell them to <PENSIVE FACE>
Pandora puts me in my feelings thinking about all the good turn ups my freshman year of college <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
And butter pecan ice cream <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>
I want a large Hi-C from McDonald's <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
I stay telling my mom all my old high stories, forgetting that she is my mom <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
Up like I don't have to be at the doctor at 8 <WEARY FACE>

Now that I've laid down everything hurts <TIRED FACE>
I will be in the house NYE and I'm perfectly fine with that.
I just want a friend that will sit with me and let me cry. I don't even need to talk about it, just cry until there's no more tears left <SLEEPY FACE>.
Like really all I want is to be appreciated for the effort. But instead I'm being emotionally drained.
No matter how much I just try to make people happy, it comes off as me being a bitch or being the bad person <SLEEPY FACE>
I never knew just wanting somebody by your side came at such a high price tag. Love and loyalty just isn't enough anymore..
There's no such thing as a "perfect Christmas" there's always one person who wants you to feel just as shitty as they do.
This was the best Christmas ever <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
Everybody kept telling me I've gotten big and I'm just sitting here like, I gained .5 pounds <CONFUSED FACE>
What I got for Christmas is far better than anything materialistic <RELIEVED FACE>
@Queen_Ann14 lol glad I could make you proud!
Main reason I don't come the fuck over here.
Some places ice is "wetter" than others. No, I'm not crazy.
Not all ice is the same. Like I prefer crushed to cubed.
Goodnight <VICTORY HAND>Ô∏è<SLEEPING FACE>
I don't know why I'm fighting my sleep
I just got this phone a few months ago and I think the battery is messed up <WEARY FACE>. I've never had this issue with any of my other iPhones.
I get annoyed so easily <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
My mom is so serious about this Wiz album, rapping and shit
Have you ever been so hungry that you watch your mom cook?
Felicia is really in character tonight with these braids <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

My stepdad gets 3 weeks off of work for the holidays <FLUSHED FACE>.
Slowly but surely checking things off of my to do list <OK HAND SIGN>
It's bad when my mom still manages to talk shit to me in my dreams. Like <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT> black parents don't even let you dream peacefully anymore.
Hell I didn't even think we'd speak after that first day <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>.
If I go back to the first day I met Cam, never in a million years would I have thought that we would still be together years later <RELIEVED FACE><REVOLVING HEARTS>

I'm too busy looking towards February to be excited about Christmas.

Still managed to get out of the house today so I didn't feel so lazy <RELIEVED FACE>
Carter doesn't like Cam because he always messing with him <UNAMUSED FACE>
Like I'm awkward sometimes, I admit that.
I am such a quiet person that I don't know how I made the few friends that I do have.
I feel better now that I have a little food in my system <OK HAND SIGN>.
Like in my house, my baby sister run shit. It's our fault for spoiling her though.
I'm so hungry <LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE><LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
All I've eaten today is marshmallows and pretzels <PENSIVE FACE>. I need to do better.
My sister &gt;&gt; yours <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS> 
Poor Carter likes hood music already <FACE WITH COLD SWEAT>. He hype to this Migos lol.
Think I might go to bed early tonight, have a long day full of 2nd graders and kindergarteners tomorrow.
So we really sitting in the car watching Players Club..
This is the first time my mom hasn't cooked in ages <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>. Like she know she can't do that shit.
When Cam in one of his moods and I have nobody to talk to, I just sit around waiting for him to text me like.. 
I just laugh at the shit that Cam and I argue about <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SW>. Like it never fails to amaze me.
Good morning <FACE THROWING A KISS> 
My hands are teal <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>. Fml.
One of the only reasons I don't want an epidural is because Memorial is known for fucking up. I don't have time for that.

My little sister isn't a baby anymore <SLEEPY FACE> she just told me she doesn't need me to fix her food for her, she got it <DISAPPOINTED FACE>.
I cannot with this show, like it's so fake but they're trying to be so serious.
If my son comes out with his daddy attitude <CONFOUNDED FACE>, pray for me because Cam is a handful in himself!
Who is this dude <WHITE RIGHT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX><CONSTRUCTION WORKER><WHITE LEFT POINTING BACKHAND INDEX> and why does he look so depressed?
Have so much I need to do, so I think I'm going to sit here and just watch tv instead <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>.

Ate, now I want to take a nap until my mom leaves <SLEEPING FACE>
My hair needs to be washed so bad <WEARY FACE>.
Eyes keep shutting... Trying so hard to stay awake but <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
I remember when my mom used to have the tv's in the backseat with the play station hookup. I stayed in there playing Spyro the Dragon <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Plus I still have to look at paint samples and pick a few colors for our room..
I just want to go to sleep right now but I know it's too early.
65 days <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I hate that Portrait Innovations only lets you book appointments 2 weeks in advance. Like I need to book it now for January.
My sister wakes me up every morning to tell me they're leaving for school. It's going to be sad not having that in a few weeks <SLEEPY FACE>
I got called bipolar last night, by one of the MOST bipolar people I know <UNAMUSED FACE>
Like why am I so hungry?
I just want a cup of crushed ice...
Me and my brother have been on the couch watching tv all day.
Today has been the most uncomfortable day <TIRED FACE>
‚Äú@daisymaee__: Couples go thru shit, but depending on how they take it gives the outcome of how long they'll last.‚Äù
Couldn't risk my charger breaking, had to steal that one from my mom <UNAMUSED FACE>
My uncle asked me if I swallowed a whole turkey on Thanksgiving <UNAMUSED FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>.
I'm really hungry. I just don't know what I want to eat.
My baby sister is the only voice of reason in this house, except when it comes to her getting her way.
Is it selfish to want the person making your life hell, to feel the same way you do?
Should probably go dry my clothes now...
I want to go to JOT today. That's my goal...
I think it's weird when Carter gets the hiccups. Like it feels so weird.
Literally came home and cried myself to sleep earlier.
<PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE><PENSIVE FACE>

I hate hospitals with a passion and I've managed to avoid one for almost 6 months. Too bad that ends today <PERSEVERING FACE>
Being sick is not for me. I literally cannot handle it and cry like a big ass baby <LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I swear Carter better come out with a full blown Afro, this heartburn is ridiculous <WEARY FACE><FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>.
I want tacos.
I hate being sleepy, but not being able to sleep <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>.
3 people in my house have the flu <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK>. I got my <SYRINGE> this year! Carter and I are playing no games <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>.
I need to get my sleep schedule on track <PERSEVERING FACE>
@mypearl_kisses they're good, send me a DM with your address and email btw so I can send you some things!
Why do guys get so into playing the damn game?
I can speak in circles and still say shit real clear. It's just up to you to actually figure out how it applies to you
I fight my urge to be petty on the daily <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
The nap I just took put me in a good mood <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>.
That shower just woke Carter all the way up. It had the reverse effect on me <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>.
Maybe I should go back to sleep now <FACE WITHOUT MOUTH><FACE WITHOUT MOUTH>
Don't you hate when you're perfectly wrapped in your warm ass blanket, then your body decides the position is no longer comfortable?
But you're so warm, you say fuck it and just lay there in an uncomfortable position, comfortably...
My mother had the nerve to come in, tell me exactly how cold it was outside, then ask if I'm going out <CONFUSED FACE>. No, I will not freeze my ass off <FACE WITH NO GOOD GESTURE>
Like it felt good when I went to sleep, woke up feeling like I was in the middle of Antarctica <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
Need to send out these invitations, but I'm hella lazy <PERSEVERING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>

‚Äú@bugattibeez: high.‚Äù I bought you some shades <EYEGLASSES><SMILING FACE WITH SUNGLASSES>
That's where I've grown the most, I don't air out my dirty laundry. Hell I have "friends" that's in the dark wondering wtf is going on.
It will only open the door for onlookers to judge what's going on in my life before I even get a chance to figure things out.
As much as I just want to come on here and vent and get shit off my chest, I don't.
I hate driving my mom's truck. Shit feel like I'm a bus driver or some shit.
Everybody complaining about how cold it is, I'm just in the house enjoying this nice heat <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è
If it weren't for my little sister, I would never eat breakfast.
‚Äú@spicesbby: i hate apologizing first because somehow i end up regretting that shit later like always do.‚Äù
But the good news is, Carter actually let me get some schleep last night <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD>. I guess he was all partied out from Saturday still..
Cam can make me want to snap and just go crazy <POUTING FACE>. But I still can't stop myself from wanting to talk to him all day <PENSIVE FACE>.

I'm literally annoyed with everybody except my little people. They are the only ones who haven't gotten on my nerves already this week.
Cam's mom tried to put me in a coma from all that food <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
The more I think about shit, the more pissed off I make myself.
My back is throbbing <PERSEVERING FACE>
So basically they are saying all those people that gave statements came together and put together a story of what happened?
Wait a damn minute. Why all of a sudden they saying he was shot in the hand, when the whole time they have been saying it was his arm first?
My back kills when I sit up too long <PERSEVERING FACE>.
Felicia blessed my life and soul with that breakfast <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Ate beef these last two days and haven't felt good since <PERSEVERING FACE>.
In my head I know he okay, but the fact that he's not responding stresses me out. I haven't even slept two hours wondering about him <UNAMUSED FACE>.
Does Cam not realize I'm too far along for him to be disappearing into thin air?! I know he okay, but still <POUTING FACE>.
I'm worried, he doesn't just randomly turn his phone off unless something is really wrong <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
I'm getting sleepy, but the kid didn't get the memo and he won't be still <WEARY FACE>.
I swear that's why I don't drive unless I have to. You can't just drive for yourself you gotta watch out for everybody. These roads not safe
My grandma is always trying to feed me. I can just have eaten and she will still offer to feed me.
Carter knows when it's bedtime. That's his cue to start bouncing around <WEARY FACE>.
My grandparents have a stuffed Clifford dog and they treat that shit like it's real. Got the thing watching TV and all
I just need to go to sleep. My emotions are uncontrollable when I'm tired <PENSIVE FACE><PERSEVERING FACE><SLEEPY FACE>.
Guess it's all just a test.
It's like everything builds up just to crash right back down.
I love him, Lord knows I do.
I am not a morning person. I'm more of a, "wake me up when dinner's ready" type of person these days. <SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE><SLEEPING FACE>
I'm obsessed with my baby sister. In my eyes she could never do anything wrong <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS>
The fact that I only have 3 months left <FLUSHED FACE>
Carter is a night time baby. He get hype when the sun start going down.
I want tacos and Nicole bitch ass just sent me a picture of her eating a taco <WEARY FACE><UNAMUSED FACE>.
It literally took me about 2 years of trial and error to finally accept my hair.

Lord knows my life will be a heck of a lot better next week <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
I'm not a very good babysitter. At least not to my sister and cousins. Hell they know how to work the tv, that's all they need.
Hopefully I get this call back sometime next week <PERSON WITH FOLDED HANDS>
I already feel like I need a nap. I guess it's just that kind of day..
@kyla_ross96 really proved that CONSISTENCY is the real key. Literally obsessed with her <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION><HEAVY BLACK HEART>Ô∏è
@Simone_Biles congratulations CHAMP!! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>
Can't wait for the day I pack everything up and leave everybody behind.. Refuse to introduce Carter to the lies and deceit  of some.

‚Äú@PrecioussssB: My patience is very low !!!‚Äù!!! <FACE WITH LOOK OF TRIUMPH>
I'm just ready for my vacation. This shit is getting ridiculous.
I literally just had to sit in my car and calm myself down because I was really on the verge.
I love staying at my Nanny's house. She always takes such good care of me <WHITE SMILING FACE>Ô∏è.

Unless going out twice for food is productive <NEUTRAL FACE>
Subway makes me happy <RELIEVED FACE>
I'm petty, I'm getting better though.
Am I hungry, or just bored? Either way I think food is the best cure for the issue.
I'm hungry and sleepy. But to get food I actually have to leave the house <PERSON BOWING DEEPLY>.
Just sitting in the middle of the street with no gas.
The shit that happens in my life, I cannot make up.
But I smile and play it off because there are people going through a lot more shit that actually matters.
No lie, I hurt a lot these days. And it's all from the same source.
I've had heartburn everyday this week and it's hell <FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK><FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>

If I care so much to the point where I get blocked, or ignored, or anything else, why keep trying?
I admit, I had my feelings hurt this week, to the point where I question is it even worth it anymore?
Have to call my doctor tomorrow..
I'm ready for this dizzy stage to be over with. Bout passed out trying to do my hair and while doing the dishes <WEARY FACE>.
Just when I think a person can't become anymore idiotic and irresponsible than they already are, I magically get proven wrong. Such a shame.

@Queen_Ann14 I love you too!
Or the fact that my little sister just gave me the best hug and kiss ever and told me that she was going to miss me while she was at school<LOUDLY CRYING FACE>
I just want to cry about stupid shit like the fact that I have no glasses so I can't see to drive

@CCU_DSO no, thank you for being so wonderfully amazing!
@CCU_DSO will do!
@CCU_DSO all week I've been told they were just behind and that it would be okay, then this email pops up. Yes I will be available to talk.
@CCU_DSO put on a waiting list but there is still unlikely that we will receive housing assignments.
@CCU_DSO they sent out an email today addressed specifically to transfer sophomores and the Junior/Senior class that we may choose to be...
Then they said specifically "transfer sophomores" if somebody made the decision to make such a big switch that's not a very good welcome!
Even though I have been on the phone with University Housing EVERY DAY this week and she kept assuring me, "Oh we're just a little behind."
@CCU_DSO what kind of school tells you the WEEK before school starts that you PROBABLY won't have anywhere to stay when you get down there?!
I'm only on twitter really late at night. I don't sleep at all.
Just posted a photo

Sometimes it's not the people that hurt you, it's yourself overthinking everything that'll shut you down.
