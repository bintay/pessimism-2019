Sometimes its easier to say you don't care than to explain all the reasons why you do.

Give it your best shot, make sure there are no room for regrets.
We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
People seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.
Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic.
Learn to smile at every situation. See it as an opportunity to prove your strength and ability.
The only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude.
Think big thoughts but relish small pleasures.
So often time it happens, we all live our life in chains, and we never even know we have the key.
If you don't get everything you want, think of the things you don't get that you don't want."
