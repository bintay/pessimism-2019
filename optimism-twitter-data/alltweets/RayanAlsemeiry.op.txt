School and my schedule have always been my excuse for not getting in relationships.

If you aren't black then please don't think your argument on why black racial inequality doesn't exist is valid.
If you want more information on why Baltimore is up in flames and why race is still a huge issue.

Is it really procrastination if I have no intention of actually doing anything?
My procrastination consists of mindlessly cycling through all of my social media apps in hopes of finding something new.
