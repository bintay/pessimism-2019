as you see here ladies and gents, just another reason to spit in someone's food...be a better person or you're next  
bro, there's not enough time in the WORLD to even begin to list the reasons  
@_demilouu lets go, lol
@pois0nnn a little hocus pocus on a friday night
I need to work for @Scumbag66615, because who doesn't love a good lesbian orgy with naked beer pong lol
@KChiver that was last year though lol I'll actually be able to watch the game tomorrow lol
@KChiver Sanchez vs Guthrie, we'll see how it goes, I know Sanchez is 2-3 but he's got some sick control on his pitches
@KChiver he just thought he was the closes to it, which he was but the 3rd basemen was going through the motion to pick it up lol
late night wally world runs...for ice cream <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> you females and your cravings
@KChiver I just thought we would have 2 men on with no outs, 3rd basemen should of thrown that ball to 1st, not the pitcher lol
@KChiver Price was cruising and then idk wtf happened, then dude gets hurt, so pleased with our bullpen tonight lol that throwing error tho
@KChiver got nothing to say after that walk off, huh? Lol

@KChiver it should be Greene going on Sunday, but it depends on what the pitching coach says about his bullpen session and his command
@KChiver Price tonight, Sanchez tomorrow and Sunday is TBD so either Greene or someone from the minors, I'll have to wait and see
@KChiver Greene and Simon need to get their shit together, started out amazing and now they have no command on he mound, I can't wait for JV
@KChiver it's a good game to have on it though, rivals that are gonna be contending for first all year, it's gonna be a great matchup
@KChiver I'm always ready, sir! looking forward to Sunday night baseball too

@Lord_Anarchy it's something we never thought would ever happen, it's gonna be epic, and I'm glad it was filmed in Michigan lol
@Lord_Anarchy he's a great director, and you're right DC is going for that darker side of things, the trailer for BvS has me pumped
@Lord_Anarchy I'm stoked for SvB and Suicide Squad, they're trying to compete with Marvel but idk if they'll be able to exceed that lol
@Lord_Anarchy I'm sure a lot of people hate Sony for what they did with him, Marvel will correct it and it'll be amazing per usual
@Lord_Anarchy it's gonna be insane, dude..I'm also looking forward to seeing what they do with Spidey
@Lord_Anarchy probably so, and I cannot wait to see it all come together
@Lord_Anarchy truth, I liked the new group at the end, they could have a movie themselves which could be amazing
@Lord_Anarchy idk if they're gonna have more, I guess it all depends on the actors, there's no way you can replace them
@Lord_Anarchy he needs a stand alone film for sure, and good lord, 2028..that's honestly insane lol and Civil War is gonna be epic
@Lord_Anarchy without a doubt, I was pumped when I saw him and look forward to phase 3
saw Age of Ultron last night and OH MY GOD! soooooo much better than the fist, and Vision looked fucking amazing <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>üèº

@KChiver I've been pulled over for speeding and running a stop sign, I know I did wrong, so I was perfectly calm when I got caught

I can rattle off a million other reasons why, but does it matter when the only thing we love will die?
all your laws and rules are outdated, all your subjects are killing the kings
I am the remedy, spit in my face.
I am the worm of a pure gestation
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the reason your future suffers
@KChiver your bullpen has been stellar for a couple years now, overall your team is pretty great honestly, we match up well
@KChiver our bullpen is always the reason we will never win a ship, I'm glad Soria is our official closer now, he's back to his normal self
@KChiver true dedication, I admire that, I was still going to Lions game when they were 0-16 lol
@KChiver 8-12...nough said lol
@KChiver Cards should be able to handle Philly lol
@KChiver gonna be a good Thursday for you then man, enjoy em! I'll be able to watch the Sunday game, I'll have to listen to the rest lol
@KChiver oh I've been waiting for this series since I saw the schedule lol I'll be going to the Sunday game when they come to Detroit

@KChiver well as you can see from my lineup, I have plenty of Tigers on there lmao, I can't help it though, they're great players
@KChiver exactly! I mean luckily it's only for like 3 games so I can still win out after their series lol
@KChiver it all depends on how they play, Rios had a couple good games but so has Hos, I'm gonna be torn when it comes to Det vs KC now lmao
@KChiver

@KChiver never say never, my friend
@KChiver insane indeed, nothing like that baseball atmosphere
@KChiver that was me in 06 after Maggs hit that HR to send us to the WS, it was insane and an amazing feeling
@KChiver just the fact that they made it there was amazing in itself lol
@KChiver total advantage for them, which makes winning home field for the WS that much more important
@KChiver I never understood why they had it like that, sucks for us because VMart has to sit on the bench and only get 1 plate appearances
@KChiver eventually I think the NL will start using a DH..their pitchers are bound to get injured more having to hit and pitch
@KChiver totally agree, plus their pitchers are used to hitting as we only do it like 6 games a year
@KChiver down 5-1, got it to 5-4 and then VMart struck out, though he's coming off the bench cause no DH in the NL, always tomorrow!
this is like the 3rd time @BENO_LDN said he was "retiring" lol
@KChiver you're the only undefeated team left sir, good luck against Minnesota
well, they made it a game at the end, can't win em all though..GREAT game by Cole though, his pitches were killing us!

@LiquorNFront I'm actually looking to see how Prince does in a full year in Texas since he was hurt for most of last year
@LiquorNFront sometimes all it takes is a new environment to make someone change, he's been great for us
@LiquorNFront I was shocked when we got rid of Fielder, I expected us to be stuck with him, so happy we got Kinsler out of that deal
@LiquorNFront they see it all, trade talent for better talent lol I believe that trade brought Price here
@LiquorNFront I was pissed when we traded Granderson there, but was happy with how well Jackson did, then we traded him <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
I hate rain delays <NEUTRAL FACE>
@ShitSamiSays_ seems like you may need new friends
@LiquorNFront I've always hated the evil empire as well, but they definitely have talent on that team, and we always seem to make trades
@LiquorNFront yeah, Toronto. and just like I remember watching Granderson come up and shine, it's always great
@WiiLLUMs fuck all that, that's sneaky as shit <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@WiiLLUMs I hear ya <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@WiiLLUMs they have apps for that lol
take notes <OK HAND SIGN>üèª 
@LiquorNFront bottom of the lineup was on fire today, even the lead off Gose kid was a HR shy of the cycle, I'm gonna enjoy seeing him
@LiquorNFront I knew Price would get the shutout, I haven't seen Sanchez pitch a full game since last year, only went 6 2/3 but looked great
@LiquorNFront my bad, Greene is pitching tomorrow, that's the kid we got from NY lol
@LiquorNFront we had an off day, we'll be 3-0 tomorrow hopefully, have Lobstein or whoever pitching lol and yeah, they'll always get caught
@LiquorNFront thank you, lmao
@LiquorNFront people talked that shit when Miggy got the triple crown, that's the first thing anyone says, they get paid to hit and train
@SparklerDick13 that's what I keep hearing

all I see is people bitching about the new iOS update..sad really <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
@KChiver and I'm thankful he's on my fantasy baseball squad this year <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
@KChiver spring training is just a extra long warm up to the actual season, I don't take anything from it lol but we're only 2 games in lol
@KChiver Chicago and Cleveland have the talent, especially with that Abreu kid in Chicago, and well Minnesota is Minnesota lol
@KChiver what a rivalry that's become, nothing but respect for what they accomplished last year
@KChiver hell yeah, I'm pumped for that movie, especially because most of it was filmed in my home state <OK HAND SIGN>
@KChiver @trplh4life she's a hottie for sure, I was glad to see her in 6, even though she dies
@KChiver exactly, made the most sense
@ibrandx_ makes me not wanna update when I get on wifi lol
@KChiver @trplh4life only thing that makes that movie relevant is the ending of Fast 6 because they planned that out kinda perfectly lol
@KChiver Tokyo Drift is like the step child, no one wants to really acknowledge it, but it still happened lol and I definitely need that too
@KChiver same here, I have the entire collection, even Tokyo Drift lol
@KChiver you're not lying, since the first movie, they just clicked and it was always great to see that chemistry between em
@KChiver 
@KChiver was that the interview he walk off on? Ive seen so many of the interviews
@KChiver exactly, I hope he got some more of comfort in the movie finally being out and doing what he wanted to do to end the film for Paul
@KChiver Paul was his brother, even Paul's family knew it would hit Vin the worse than anybody else
@KChiver seeing it again this weekend, the ending hit me right in the feels
@KChiver same, definitely teared up listening/watching it
@KChiver I'm not even a fan of Wiz and I love the song
congrats on the first RBI in the big leagues McCann!  @tigers

@VMGBlake just wait till Miggy gets back into form, he's 100% this year, that alone is scary lol
@VMGBlake teams need to understand, if you walk VMart, we have JD and then Cespedes behind him now, it's scary good
damnit JD! lol
@VMGBlake he's made a couple great catches already, but it takes a lot more than that unfortunately
typical Minnesota Twins and it's only game 2 of the 2015 season <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
how dare you throw at Miggy's head..you got a death wish <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY><FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>

@LiquorNFront they both say they wanna stay here, we shall see what happens, just glad baseball is back
@LiquorNFront I'm not even mad Max went to Washington, I knew we wouldn't get him back
@LiquorNFront I wouldn't mind resigning him and Price to a multi year deal lol
@LiquorNFront we had to give up Rick Porcello though, great pitcher, just started doing good things last year and then poof
@LiquorNFront we aren't trading him, we need him and that arm, plus he's talking about wanting to sign a extension here..still pissed
@LiquorNFront I never quite understood why they made that deal, but in the scheme of things I'm glad they did cause now he's here lol
@LiquorNFront hell yeah, Cespedes already robbed someone of a HR in the game yesterday, he's got speed, an arm and pop in the bat, I'm happy
@LiquorNFront we got Cespedes from Boston and a Shane Greene from NY
@LiquorNFront then we got Pudge, Ordonez and Miggy and everything started to fall into place somewhat
@LiquorNFront @hashim_cole I sure as hell didn't, I appreciate em for it though, it's nice to finally have competition in the central again
@LiquorNFront @hashim_cole I would say KC or Detroit as well
@LiquorNFront @hashim_cole I'm all for that, most people I talk to have Chicago or KC taking the Central this year lol
@hashim_cole @LiquorNFront WORLD SERIES HERE YOU COME <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
congrats to @RickPorcello on that 4 year extension in Boston..we here in Detroit are proud of how far you've come!

your relationship is just that; yours. It doesn‚Äôt have to make sense to anyone else.
stay single until someone actually compliments your life in a way that makes it better than to not be single. Otherwise, it‚Äôs not worth it.
a relationship with no arguments is a relationship with a lot of secrets.
you can never ‚Äòjust be friends‚Äô with somebody you used to love, simply because a little part of you will always love them, no matter what
when someone walks out of your life they are giving you the sign there is someone better to be in your life.
be proud of every scar on your heart, each one holds a lifetime‚Äôs worth of lessons
You can‚Äôt keep messing up someone elses feelings just because you are unsure of your own.
some men focus more on how to get a woman, but once they have her, they lose focus on how to keep her.
loving someone who doesn‚Äôt love you is like waiting for a ship at the airport.
don't you dare remember me the moment I start forgetting you.
why do girls run from the guys who try to make them happy and fight for the ones who make them cry?
some people aren‚Äôt meant to be in our lives forever, some are just passing through to teach us a lesson.
the heart is a muscle, and do you know what muscles do when they‚Äôre torn?..they grow back stronger.
you can‚Äôt blame someone for walking away if you didn‚Äôt do anything to make them stay.
the more anger you hold in your heart towards the past, the less capable you are of loving the present
sometimes the best way to get a person‚Äôs attention is to stop giving them yours
I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, the worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel alone
sometimes giving someone a second chance is like giving them another bullet for their gun because they missed you the first time.
weak people seek revenge, strong people forgive, intelligent people ignore
If you don‚Äôt fight for what you want, don‚Äôt cry for what you lost.
Don‚Äôt feel sad over someone who gave up on you. feel sad for them because they gave up on someone who would have never given up on them
Getting over a painful experience is much like crossing monkey bars. You have to let go at some point in order to move forward.

I hate people who have never worked a day in their life and are just handed everything...you have no idea what the FUCK I've been through
I kinda like being an asshole 85% of the time...I no longer give a fuck..it's Twitter..big fucking deal...
@Apepsimonkey then end it
‚Äú@RheaLynnTurner: If he hurts u so bad why do u keep going back to him???‚Äù

because females are fucking stupid
someones heart is a terrible thing to fuck with
don't say I love you unless you 100% fucking mean it
they just throw it around to have someone's heart think they actually do love them, until they fucking end it
people throw the word "I love you" around way to fucking easily now en days, and 98% of the time they don't mean it
and you deserve everything I'm about to put you through
You're a shitty fucking person
I feel like everything you've ever told me was a lie..
I regret the day I met you...
supervisor just had to stop me from slitting someone's throat for hitting me with his hilo...fantastic wednesday <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
