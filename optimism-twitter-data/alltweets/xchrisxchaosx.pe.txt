I can't deal with people today. Almost got ran off the road into incoming traffic. Hostests piss me off. Anyone wanna get in line
Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
Honestly I hate what I've done to my life.
I hate that regret is a daily experience.
I hate that I still care yet you don't.
@LN_Leg found your user name in a pamphlet on a plane!
I'll tell you I care as much as I can. But you just don't hear it
You killed what was left the good in me, I'm tired so let me be broken
Emotions you need to shut off soon
Let me go back and stop myself from making stupid decisions.
I don't want to feel like this anymore
Just living life as best as I can
Buying YuGiOh cards
When you asked me if I'd stay forever,
Guess you meant just for the week.
We felt so good together
It was way too good to be.
-Alkaline Trio
We are told to never talk in school
And same at work
And people question why some of us don't talk much
~life has left me in a dark place lately. Gotta create my own light. Even if its just a spark.
I'm fucked up just like you are and you're fucked up just like me
Can't say I never tried. ~
I'll be your deadman, with the blood on my hands
How time works. Leave 10 minutes earlier. Get there ten minutes sooner. HOLY SHIT
I cannot tell you how done I am. Done being nice. Done caring. Done done done. I'm overlooked and trampled on
I hate when people don't try in life. Just put for a small amount of effort and it'll work
Can't blame me for trying
It's warming up...that means...@sonicdrivein  time!
In the words of my generation...I'm going to get turnt tonight
Now my heart is a mess, murder scene in my chest , not a clue how you got through the door.
Honestly can't catch a break anymore.
Dragonzball P (Dragonball Z Parody) - Oney Cartoons: 
I've been having these weird thoughts lately...like is any of this for real, or not?
I'm eating a hot dog with spaghettios on it....and I'm not stoned....this is how life should be.
Bryson is drunk as Fuck. :D today is good

Me: "......a goat"

Counselor: "......same"
Great way to start an already shitty day
There goes that idea
Shitty day but hopefully things pass and everything gets better. #sorry
You see a storm knocked out my super power, now I sleep through thundershowers.
Honestly I need to destroy this brain of mine. It needs to stop whatever it is doing
When you just sent little pictures to show how you feel.
Typing a paper, sleep, seeing the lady, eating lunch, and we will play the rest out.
Sometimes....I wanna fight myself and kick my own ass
You pray to god and swear he talks back, well I hear voices too every time I smoke crack.
If I had the ability to erase memories you'd never know me
Well its one of those days
Not gunna lie kinda depressed today
Up at six...going to watch anime and build my gundam...
Getting a gym membership with @natefigs tomorrow. Not as a new year thing, we both just have decent paying jobs and can afford it now

@aSF_Gir yup. After almost two years and working up to manager
I can honestly I'm excited to be leaving my work. It's been a great experience but the company is falling in the wrong direction
Who else can say they got a Halloween card from their favorite band? @TheRealCFBand @CurtisRx
Happy Halloween @CurtisRx @TheRealCFBand
Way too excited for next week's episode of #walkingdead
I remember when everyone in my store did their part. If something needed done, we got it done. No complaints.
And he barely works as it is. 
Oh you want me to work more in the holidays? Fuck that
No one realizes just how much work I put into my store... I mean really. Me and one other employee are the only "workers"
I bet @CurtisRx is watching #thewalkingdead :D
Just want to do something

Hm so you can pay for a super bowl commercial but can't do what you originally planned...getting real sick of this...

My goal: to meet @AndrewWK at canterlot gardens...
So take this to heart when i say FUCK YOU.
You turned a decent day into a day where i want to just move, preferably to a place where I'm accepted.
Whats that mom? You don't want me to think im " too good to stock shelves and unload trucks" well too bad
Im fine with that too. Since ya know, its warm down there.
What i learned today: I'm no longer welcome in my family.
My dads okay with me. But my mom, probably wants me to rot in hell
@aSF_Gir I'll see if I can, it'd be a lot easier to go with you and crash at your place instead of drive home xD
@asf_gir if i get enough paychecks ill do both
Fucking zombie arm
Downloaded a reddit app to my phone.. there goes life
@aSF_Gir just did a quick look , nothing yet

Life has its ups and downs.
Kinda feels like mine is in a very hilly region
Till death do us part, I'll tear you apart!
Well Id rather cut you than the wedding cake. And your bloody guts on my rented tux and I do I do I do wanna kill you.
@thelunalovebad excuse me, what's your tattoo on your arm of?
Wearing my @AndrewWK shirt while lounging. Why? Cause it's always party time
If you want a battle , ill give you a war
If you want a sip, ill give you a bottle
Step on the brakes, ill take it full throttle
Just think about this. It's not failure to operate, it's failure to communicate.
I feel great atm. Dunno why. I feel as if i can take on anything! Bring it world :D the past is the past.
Breaks over back to unloading a second truck. #mothatrucka
Mmm amp is amazing!
@valoopy thanks bro
At work stomach is upset 
Probably cause i was
Work and class today.fuck
I never said that I didn't need you
Put down your arms
And wrap them both right around me
Right around me
I feel locked away
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
Crushing on my head are boulders
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
Hush,hush The world is quiet
Hush,hush We both can't fight it
Its us that made this mess
Why cant you understand?
Whoa,I won't sleep tonight
It’s always the same
Sad story again
You lose all your friends
That’s the thing about trust
Falling down can feel strange
No one remembers your name,
You’re losing the game
That’s the thing about trust
@aSF_Gir no no I meant like if I tweet the stuff, they will read it.thats what I want :3
Getting back isn't the best revenge.
Having it not bother you is.
@aSF_Gir it's nothing big really. I'm fine and all. :P plus people who were involved will read the stuff
@aSF_Gir con drama. Mhm nothing I can't handle just kinda annoyance ya know
May tweet some lyrics or thoughts. Just to get shit off my chest.
Kinda wish i could redo things a tad bit differently these past couple days.
Matsuricon was fun. Aside from a minor incident
Stairs are kinda comfy
Jager 
My love.
How you treat me like a warm embrace
But leave me saddened, without a trace
Well fuckin then
#matsuricon!!!!
Hello #matsuricon!

@xboxsupport it just said "you are suspected of cheating, through connection modification "
@xboxsupport correct
@XboxSupport I'm not 100% positive, don't wanna get banned for doing it again. About 3 or 4 matches.
@XboxSupport it says cheating and tampering with connection. But if one of us plays without the other Xbox on, it's fine
@XboxSupport so my friend and I are playing fall of cybertron on the same internet, diff xboxs, and we get kicked for "cheating"
@XboxSupport I need some help guys

@think_link I'll be at shinboku:)
@is_anyone_up hey lemme buy an extra shirt! :D
@sharuhh why thank you :3
@sharuhh the answer is two
@Williamcontrol condescending William Control
@ColeMahle it doesn't make you smarter. The only reason it killed brain cells in their experiments is cause they suffocated the monkeys
Oh and it's Hitler's birthday.
And 420 is the cop code for marijuana
Not kills. #endrant
Plus 99% only know what they hear from their parents and take no time to see what the government actually says. It restores brain cells  ...
I kinda wish people would stop ragging on 420. I realize it's annoying to see but seriously #stopjudging
@Williamcontrol just saw a church sign, it read "without bread in your life, you'd be toast"
Go see cabin in the woods. Do it. Do it now.
Just saw a jeep with the triforce and star wars sticker....yes
@williamcontrol believe?
@Williamcontrol i thank you for the walls of death :)
@sharuhh have fun!
Really hoping that everyone that tuned in to #Toonami shows the network that we want it back.
Wow...  #Toonami I missed you &lt;3
@aSF_gir back to the future dvds
Giant eagle!
@andrewwk giant eagle!
@CAT_CULTURE hope you had a great night!
@andrewwk thank you for the amazing night! Right in the front!
@andrewwk your fans are waiting bro!
@andrewwk should come to his merch table :)
@AndrewWK can't wait to see you tonight!!!
So excited to see @Andrewwk tomorrow...I can't sleep
@AndrewWK tomorrow in Cleveland, any chance a friend and I could meet you?
Gah I love the Scott pilgrim movie, mostly for Ramona :) but that's not the point
My 3000th tweet goes to @AndrewWK because I'm so pumped to see him Monday
Dad told me to stay home today.... He said "stay home...I wanna see a movie." #hungergames
@Andrewwk I invite you to my house!
@CurtisRx i have a few who'd like to "volunteer."
So the movie "Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter" looks really good...
If there is a hell, I already have my room reserved
Finished the first #hungergames book...
I pray to the nonexistent god it doesn't turn twilight on me.
@aSF_Gir haha why xD

@aSF_Gir :P is the weather gorgeous like it is here?
@aSF_Gir damn my auto correct of June :P my bad!
@aSF_Gir my grad party is January 9th. I highly doubt it
@aSF_Gir well depending on the circumstances my parents set, I may not have to pay gas
@aSF_Gir my new car gets better mileage too! So it'd be cheaper :) I'd have to take back roads through,tolls suck
@aSF_Gir I'm planning on it. I'm graduating this year and just feel like I deserve a short break from Ohio
Outside reading &lt;3 my day is turning out better
I wanna go to a Turkish bathhouse with Charlie Sheen ...
