One more deflategate take for you: The unusual opportunity ahead for Garoppolo and the Patriots. Via @CBSSports 
@sam_vecenie right? the slow burn really pays off in the end
By the time Brady returns for a SNF matchup against the Colts, Patriots could be sitting at 1-3 
It's going to be funny when Garoppolo goes 3-1, and the Pats get a first round pick back by trading him in the offseason to the Browns.
Hmmmmmm, how convenient. 
Fox and Gase favor using two RBs, which could mean less carries for Forte. Still, I don't think that's very likely. 
Cutlet No. 3 on the way!!! 
odds of a Cutler playing QB in the NFL in 20 years or so keep on increasing. 
Gus Bradley is still optimistic about the Jaguars' chances in 2015, despite Dante Fowler's injury. He shouldn't be: 
when they make a biopic on Luis Suarez, I really hope they don't entirely mess it up.

hi there Smackley
@mattsnydercbs thanks, Matt.
@fandings no suspension for Brady, just a fine. Nothing for Belichick.
On Vic Fangio's comments regarding Jared Allen's "rebirth" 
@rillbeck ill need one on June 1st, which gives you a few weeks to get it down to Berkeley.
I wrote about how Manziel's path to starting is all about him. Because the competition is named Josh McCown: 
Turned on the TV to Robinson Cano batting, facing a 2-0 count with runners on 1st and 2nd. Not the worst thing on TV.

Didn't see it, but I imagine LOMO was, you know, pretty chill about his walk off for the @Mariners.
I see you Cano
The one where Adam Gase calls former Cal RB and current Bronco CJ Anderson "chubby." 
also, H/T to @adamjahns for tweeting the Marshall/Patriots stuff.
B-Marshall said he almost got traded to the Pats, so I wrote about it. Favorite angle: Marshall, McDaniels reunite. 
Even Burns is tweeting about it. RT “@_SBurns: ESPN and Bill Simmons have parted ways:

@cotyyi probably had more to do with Mayweather controlling nearly the entire fight.
Pacquiao says he didn't press in the 11th and 12th rounds because he thought he was winning…
Mayweather won't chase 50-0. Says he'll retire after his next fight. Pacquiao, on the other hand, says that he thought he won the fight…

Hey Shaq, would you rather dunk or shoot 99 free throws?

@ollieukez then again, there's no way you start Mettenberger over Mariota.
Philip Rivers is expecting his 8th kid. His #1 challenge: teaching at least one of his kids how to throw a football like a shot put.
Nolan Nawrocki on Kevin White: Ranked No. 1 of WRs. A scout compared him to Fitzgerald. Great size-speed. Needs to learn to read coverages.
@fbgchase maybe he can play defense too
.@mariners CC: @RyanDivish
@ritchieleeggo idk if it's the best fit for carolina, but i think he'll be a stud.
Is going to be fun to watch Rivera deploy Thompson. Doesn't have to fit a traditional role. Line him up in lots of places. Let him attack.
Shaq Thompson was one of my favorite players in the draft. I really think the Panthers got a steal. And, for the record, I think he's a LB.
[insert Denver marijuana law shane ray joke]
Love that trade for Denver. As @fbgchase just said, it makes so much sense considering his high ceiling. Hard to get a guy like that at 23.
YEESSSSS
only way I'd be fine with the Bears trading up to grab Mariota is if it only involves the No. 7 pick and Cutler. Nothing more.
.@NextImpulse is on @Medium now. Pretty cool stuff: 
Matt Forte is the man. And I really hope that after this season, a team — not the Bears — gives him the contract he wants.
@michaelrosen3 uhhhh, sure 
@michaelrosen3 you are not elite.

you stayed when you were up 20 but you're leaving down 2 with 5 seconds left?
Refs: For every Steph Curry on your team, the other team gets 1 free point.
Peak Sports Twitter, btw.
Pelicans just discovered the "back" button on their xbox controller.
Y wuld they leave Anderson open when you can legally defend a 3 like this? 
Kerr definitely gave Bogut a "good job" nod after RT “@cjzero: Probably should have been 15 yards and replay of down

@hpbasketball in fairness, they tried their hardest to foul Curry during the 3.

Pretty much. 
The Mariners have been thrown out at the plate, been caught stealing, and have been picked off 2nd base. It's the 3rd inning.
Might just be the irrational fan in me, but the Mariners 3rd base coach is kinda bad at decision making. Maybe a problem, but idk.
No word on Cal's attendance numbers yet...

A Mike Tyson biopic -- directed by Scorsese, starring Jamie Foxx -- might be on its way. Story for @CBSSports: 
Roach wants Pacquiao to get "meaner" for Mayweather, which might be an odd strategy. My latest for @CBSSports: 
Twitter: a place for discussion. 
@peteblackburn @nextimpulse @kileykmiec appreciate that, #gifboy
@nextimpulse okay, #gifboy or @kileykmiec
@nextimpulse probably helps that your article was written by "next impulse staff" while mine was written by a mere one person.
@nextimpulse nice source ;)
Mike Tyson thinks Manny Pacquiao will beat Floyd Mayweather. Why? Perpetual motion. 
Mayweather/Pacquiao can be drug-tested at any point up until the fight. My story for @CBSSports: 
@adoughty88 thanks man. proof that packers fans and bears fans can coexist.
My first piece for @CBSSports, on how Mayweather can see in Pacquiao's eyes that he's worried. 
Yes. RT “@runofplay: Here's my new column on one of the great lost ships of WWII, and how Paul Allen found it. 
The Saints are trading Kenny Stills because…..
Dude Kyrie, you just scored 57… you're allowed to say "I am a basketball God" instead of saying "All the credit to my teammates."
@cjzero trying to force 2OT so Kyrie can score 60
@ryantwong616 we have a fun routine: they play loud music at 3 am every Friday. I stand on a chair to bang on my ceiling until they stop.
@ryantwong616 they want me to call the cops right? I think that's what the note said.
Upstairs neighbors think this note makes up for the 99 loud-music parties they've thrown in the past 100 nights. #lol 
@Riley_McAtee why would his headband be on his hand? .... Ba dum tish.
@michelle_e_lee probably because you're not a child and it's Will Ferrell we're talking about.
If you're looking for your Mayweather/Pacquiao news, 
"Rogue One." Oh yes. 
@m_vernon that and score points and don't the other team score points
"' Dave had the whole country.'" Another great story and must-read by @curtisbeast. 
@peteblackburn pretty typical Packers fan…
Goal in life: Cover a team with a coach/GM as ballsy and aggressive as Chip Kelly.
@rattersf so are you guys team cat or team dog? Because I'm concerned.
Figuring out what movie to watch and I stumbled upon this @BillSimmons gem from 2005. 
"LEONARD!"
@ryantwong616 it just comes natural.
Pacquiao is going full Jay Cutler: texting/tweeting throughout this press conference.
@ryantwong616 #analysis
Manny Pacquiao
LIVE Press Conference NOW
RIGHT HERE: 
@dabearnecess he did say this though: 
@cotyyi well 
JAKE LOCKER JUST RETIRED
@cotyyi great slot guy, perfect as a compliment to Alshon
Royal isn't going to replicate his 91-catch season he had with Cutler in 08, but giving Jay another type of target that he also likes is big
Love love love Eddie Royal.
Barring a trade, 2015 will be the 3rd straight year the Seahawks don't have a 1st round pick. Their last 1st rd pick was Bruce Irvin in 2012
Boom. From Seattle, but that was well done. RT“@ryantwong616: @seanjwagner It's the closest that Seattle will get to basketball for awhile.”
It's flashy, but I'm not sure the Hawks are going to be happy about this trade in 2 years. Also did you know that Jimmy Graham used to hoop?
I know we need a defense and all but JIMMY GRAHAM plz
@ryantwong616 had my money on @kileykmiec to say that. beat him to it.
Isaac Brock drinks cider. Nuff said. 
@DavidERod @Ky1eLong #cuttydoesit
return of the king 
Late and I'm sure most of you have already read @rembert's "Barack and Me" piece, but if you haven't, go read it now 
@m_vernon gorcey coming in strong
@m_vernon woah
@sully1289 knowing them, "quick" probably means 4 years.
@Sully1289 love the first 5 songs released
Two Modest Mouse albums? Ahhhh 
@dabearnecess don't think he's wrong. doesn't mean they'll sell for less than they're looking for.
I'd be shocked if the Bears weren't at least trying to trade Cutler. Then again, I'll be shocked if they find a good enough deal.
@sully1289 I'm jealous. mine from three years ago is already going bad
8 days 
It's funny how eerily similar this Kap trade story is to Cutler's Denver trade. Both situations have nearly identical beginnings.
Now is probably not the time to try to start a discussion about Andy Dalton 
Bought a new video game today for the first time in forever, hanging out in /r/nfl instead because March football rumors.
Vernon Davis on maybe trading Kap: 
Hard time believing that the 49ers would give up their 27-year-old franchise QB. Then again, Jed York.
@senseiscommon couldn't agree more with everything in this tweet.
@michelle_e_lee oh yeah, it seems odd. but after thinking about it for like 2.5 minutes, i'm onboard.
I love Jay Cutler an unhealthy and unreasonable amount, but if the Bears can somehow snag Kap, I'll be ecstatic.
@michelle_e_lee cutler for kap?
No, I'm not drunk: I'm all for the idea of shipping Jay and a pick for Kaepernick.
@kileykmiec it just seems odd and unexpected, but i wouldn't mind watching him gas the Packers twice a year
All about the asking price and how you're then getting rid of Jay in a way that doesn't hurt the Bears financially.
I'm actually a big Kaepernick fan and wouldn't necessarily be opposed to the idea, but it just doesn't seem like it'll actually happen
@kileykmiec @Adoughty88 classic packers fans.
@Adoughty88 @kileykmiec ok. it's the offseason. Arguing with packers fans is too tiring to do year round.
@Adoughty88 @kileykmiec hey kiley, is being GM of the Bears fun?
@riley_mcatee man, stepping it up with your emoji game
Yeah, we should praise NFL players for turning down more $ to stay with a good team, but we really shouldn't criticize those who take the $.
Isaac Brock is the coolest, weirdest dude ever 
Just great. 
Isaac Brock still the GOAT 
@michelle_e_lee sad day
This. MT “@mikecwright: Marshall caught 118passes for 1508 yds in '12 for a team that finished 10-6. How much of a distraction was he then?”
A few years ago, CHI stole Brandon Marshall from Miami for 2 3rd-rd picks. Really hoping the Bears don't make the same mistake as Miami.
.@Fitzbitz breaks down Mayweather vs. Pacquiao 
@lizzparkk we don't because there are literally no better options. might hate him now, but you'll miss him if we get rid of him.
@Sully1289 was kinda hoping mark just sang everything - except the dual vocal songs - but that probably won't happen.
@sully1289 above all, really curious to see how they handle the Tom songs.
@sully1289 if i had to guess, the songs they they'll actually rarely play this time are: M&amp;Ms, apple shampoo, online songs, wendy clear?
@sully1289 definitely. part of the problem is that with one guitarist some songs require backing tracks. but another problem is just Tom.
Man, Travis dropping that "Pro Tools" line about Tom. 
Well, the Bills just acquired their backup quarterback I guess.
didn't check Twitter for 10 minutes and then that happens. Holy crap.
The @Mariners clocking in at No. 3 
The new Modest Mouse album comes out in exactly two weeks. Has been a long eight years, here's to the last 14 days.
@adoughty88 thanks man
@ryantwong616 thanks man
@peteblackburn thanks dude
probably fitting that my excitement caused me to misspell Mayweather.
Very very very happy to say that I will be helping @CBSSports cover the Mayweahter/Pacquiao fight for the next couple months.

Nobody ends a phone conversation more awkwardly than Jim Harbaugh.
Most interesting note: Harbaugh called Carroll's decision to pass an "insightful play against a goal line defense."
Only a few minutes in, but so far this @timkawakami podcast with Jim Harbaugh is fantastic. 
.@michaelrosen3 doesn't order eggs from restaurants because he "doesn't trust them."
Even after a second viewing, I still think Whiplash is the best film to come out since Zero Dark Thirty.
Rubio just saved a ball from going out-of-bounds with a behind-the-back assist, but I'm more impressed he hit the 3 on the prior possession.
Never understood why Chicago might cut B-Marsh. Yah he's 30 &amp; cutting him saves $, but Chi isn't good &amp; needs good players. He's still good.

@tana_foster what's SN?
Can't stop watching the Wilson INT. Not sure it mattered, but Hawks were confused before the play. Baldwin and Lynch lined up incorrectly.
The fact that Ricardo Lockette — of Chicago's practice squad — was targeted on the final play of the SB says something about Seattle's WRs.

Zero interceptions.
Makes you think. 
Awwwww man. We didn't get this guy this time. 
That's a job well done, #SportsTwitter.
#jinx 
Stay classy.
Yeah, Seattle probably should've ran the ball. But there's no way Wilson should throw that pass, and in that location.
Touchdown Tom.
Just like God drew it up.
Stanford grads can count I guess.

@rillbeck this is pretty much identical to the last breakup. His letter also said nothing, while Mark and Travis actually had specifics.
@rillbeck bold. i just think he always has to be control of everything and isn't willing to compromise on anything.
Tom really abused the one-sentence graf in his letter, that's all I've got to say.
Ok. Tom has responded to Mark and Travis.

Still think Kenny Lawler ends up the best NFL WR out of the entire group.
Always thought that Harper was the most polished receiver at Cal the last two seasons.
Woah. Chris Harper going pro instead of returning to Cal.

Penalties killing Detroit on a crucial drive. At least one #narrative is thriving.
Indecision like that is so annoying. How do you not know if you're going for it or not?
@sngyn92 @michelle_e_lee i just wanted to hear it again!
@sngyn92 @michelle_e_lee ok, now you have to explain the 1st…
@sngyn92 @michelle_e_lee why do you hate them?
Sigh. 
no no no no no, that's the Detroit narrative, not yours Dallas.
@michelle_e_lee you forgot that Peyton Manning CANT win in the postseason.
@michelle_e_lee think of the alternatives. Seahawks (fans). Packers (kuuuuuuuun), Panthers (lol), Lions (Lions).
I'm at the point in my life where I'm actively rooting for the Cowboys to win the Super Bowl.
Cutler pokes head out from behind Matthew, raises hand. MT “@fbgchase: Narratives must be corrected in order. No line jumping here Matthew”
.@michelle_e_lee narratives ranked:

1) Romo throws pick-6 in OT
2) Romo throws pick-6 in 4Q
3) Suh's late hit extends game, Romo throws INT
Today, DeMarco Murray will go over 400 carries on the season.
Never forget the #narrative 
I am, like, really excited for this game. And not just because of all the #narratives

Relax. Hauschka just needs to stretch.

@ryantwong616 I would remain a Bears fan. but I would hope he does well.
Part of me just wants Cutler to get traded to the Rams or the Texans. There, I said it.
Yep. 
@dabearsblog if he fires Trestman, who coaches the last game? Can't be Kromer or Tucker, right?

Yes! Been waiting awhile for this one! 
#FreeCutler
6) :( 
3) Trestman is gone for sure.
4) Maybe Emery is too
5) Maybe Cutler is also gone (something I didn't think was a possibility).
2) If the move was about Trestman not thinking Cutler is good enough and if he wanted to think long term for the Bears, he'd play Fales.
1) Cutler getting benched is 100% Trestman trying to save face. If Clausen somehow plays well, Trestman will say it's just been Jay's fault.
Good stuff from former DailyCal-er @MikeSilver. As a Bears/Cutler fan, A-Rod makes it impossible to hate him.

@peteblackburn  
@mikesilver after a timeout.
Marquess Wilson with some really good blocking there. Just saying.
Don't get me wrong, that's a bad throw, but on 3rd and 3 that's also a bad call.
The problem with looking off the safety is that Alshon was the only deep route on the play…
@peteblackburn don't be a dick.
@sngyn92 @riley_mcatee lol
Bears winning the timeout battle.
Marc Trestman 0, Sean Payton -1.

@panthers @chicagobears @ritchieleeggo we got this.
Bears aren't playing for anything tonight,  but Cutler + Forte can end @PeteBlackburn's season tonight. That's enough for me.
For @SI_ExtraMustard:

Ya'll hate on the Newsroom all you want, but I'd watch the crap out of a Don and Sloan spinoff series.
I guess Russell Wilson's been a bit distracted lately. 
@mattbowen41 even if he doesn't and it's a completion, then the half is over… so odd.
Russell Wilson watched Johnny Football for too long today.

Wrote 1600 words on the Chicago Bears instead of studying or sleeping. 

Most interesting part of this story is th…
One last point: why hasn't kromer been fired?
1) HC Trestman blames Cutler for checking out of running plays.
2) OC Kromer blames Cutler for not checking out of running plays.
Any Bears fan that wants to get rid of Cutler after this year should be forced to watch tonight's game. Some teams would kill for Cutler.
The Bears have far bigger issues than Jay Cutler. Jay Cutler is just the easiest target.
This has to be the first time ever a team's defense is ranked #32 in points allowed, and the team's QB is branded as the problem.
@DaBearNecess my first thought too. At least would've been entertaining.
@rgbearterritory jay cutler vs. aaron rodgers.
@sully1289 funny, i posted this question in /r/brandnew and every reply said no to crosley.
@sully1289 just started in the vinyl game. recommendation for a good player?
@elxls @dabearsblog Emery wasn't passing on him.
@dabearsblog would've been cool if one more team had passed on him.
Guess who is on the BC Lions' roster…

Jordan Rodgers. Aaron's brother.
Former Cal head coach Jeff Tedford might be heading to the CFL as the BC Lions head coach, per @ArashMadani
Doesn't count, but that throw by Stanton was really great.
Idk if "points are hard to come by tonight" is an argument for kicking a FG on 4th and 1 at the 7.
A lot of ifs, but if Carson Palmer had gotten hurt two weeks earlier than he did, Jay Cutler might've been playing on TNF tonight.

@vbubber as a reporter, no, I'm not a fan.
@vbubber not a Cal fan, was our last game covering the team. Couldn't have asked for a better game.
selfie Saturday? Our last game covering Cal. 
7) with the entire offense coming back, guessing Dykes has to win 7-8 next year.
6) gotta feel for the players. Lasco and Goff were clearly emotional in press conferences. Tough way to end season.
5) 2nd straight week Lawler not available even though he was supposed to talk after the game. 3TDs and targeted on last play....
4) too many blown coverages cost them the game.
3) poorly coached game. Penalties. Not going for it on 4th down.
2) False start at the 9 is unacceptable. Burned their last timeout which meant they couldn't throw underneath from the 14.
Thoughts on the Cal game: 1) shocked Cal didn't score at the end with Lawler and those receivers.
My last football recap for @dailycal. Couldn't have asked for a better last game. 
Cal's sloppiness costs them their last timeout.
Really nice, sharp cut by Blackmon on that comeback route.
Goff nearly picked..again.
9:17 left and I'm still searching for that lede.
Pass and catch were both perfect.
Yup. BYU just went 99 yards to take the lead.
BYU chants are very very audible.
Didn't miss that one.
Wow. Cal's defense.
Stewart missed Blackmon WIDE OPEN down the field.
The seagulls are swarming.
Rubenzer perfect punt.
@daviderod unless he punts.
@daviderod nope. no reason to have him in over Goff.
Man, if Rubenzer throws the ball on this 4th and 8…
Really want to see another replay of the Goff throw. Missed the first and only one they showed us.
Refs are now saying incomplete, but I heard no whistle.
That was a 10-play drive by BYU.
Great response by BYU after that huge 14-point swing.
@eric_edholm sometimes, there are Cups.
BYU's offensive line is mauling Cal's defensive line on this drive.
That's a big swing, but there's about 19 minutes for Cal's defense to give up a few dozen points.
Well, that's a bit of a swing.
Poor decision by Stewart and Lasike had no awareness to pick up the ball.
One of the worst throws we've seen by Goff. Completely under threw Treggs up the seam. #GoffWatch
Algernon Brown stumbled when he caught it, but still managed to break a few tackles on his way to the end zone.
Wow. Stewart flushed to his right, then throws all the way across his body for the first down. Looked like a sure stop for Cal.
BYU is struggling on 3rd down today. Just 1 conversion.
As soon as I say that Cal's defense has only given up 14 points, a Cal defender misses an easy tackle and Mathews goes for 39 yards.
Goff missed on that sideline throw to Treggs. Treggs was 1-on-1.
Goff nearly got Harper decapitated.
@riley_mcatee if they can play defense.
The classic 2-hand touch scenario: "I sacked him, I sacked him!" *Sees teammate intercept pass* "Just kidding!"
Cal fans upset even before the play is overturned, but it should be overturned.
I think he's down. Yes, I think it's conclusive.
BYU had a guy wide open in the end zone, but the trick play took a second too long to develop, allowed Cal to recover.
Wow. What a play by Stewart to evade the rush, the throw off balance to convert a 3rd down.
Theory: Cal commits so many PIs because their defensive backs aren't nearly good enough to adequately cover downfield.
@bestcoastin Lawler is still a bit raw in terms of route running, but if he polishes his game.
Kenny Lawler is going to be a very good pro one day.
Vicinity Kenny.
I really want a 4th down just so we see what Sonny does.
Harper got turned around on the play, managed to correct himself to make a huge catch for Cal.
DB playing 7 yards off of Harper. Cal's gonna throw those screens all day.
BYU squanders great field position by throwing a pick.
Cal's defense manages to force a punt…because BYU flat out dropped a first down.
BYU is letting Lawler run wide open in the end zone for some reason.
Lots of short passes on that drive for Goff which is making the oline's job a whole lot easier.
Vicinity Kenny isn't letting 2 slip through his hands
Cal football.
@michelle_e_lee right?
Under review regression?
BYU marched down the field, but aided by two Cal penalties along the way for 30 total yards.
Under review. Memories.

Quietest gameday ever. People must be sad it's my last game covering the team.
glad people can have their narrative now.
@sngyn92 actually pleasantly surprised it's this close.
Which was a foul. Just unfortunate.
Screwed on the PI. Then that. Mannnn.
Hurst not picking that off is probably going to lead to 7 for Detroit.
Drop killed that drive. Can't be 3rd and 8 against this defense.
3 drops today.
Dropped first down, sack. Bleh.
Well, that entire sequence was predictable.
Now that the Bears decided to start 14-3, they have so so so much potential to ruin my thanksgiving.
@ryantwong616 he also called it a trend....it happens 10 times a season at most lol
@Riley_McAtee wasn't able to watch this game. Thanks for keeping me updated.
@Riley_McAtee I'll keep it strictly #analysis for you.
Impressive plan by Trest so far. Short screens are essentially running plays and more effective against Lions D.

@Sully1289 word will listen when I get home. Siamese Dream is one of my favorite albums.
@Sully1289 I haven't. Worth it?
@Sully1289 I'm always disappointed since they came back.
260. 
Lasco: "We know when we're clicking on all of our cylinders, I don't think any defense can stand up against us."
…but we haven't found what it is." (2/2)
Lasco on slow starts: "Honestly, I think maybe it's just how the game is. I wish there was a clear cut answer I could give you. (1/2)
"I think that's good…we need to be focused on BYU." - Lasco on Dykes only bringing up a bowl game once.
Lasco: "It's going to be difficult to get that out of your mind and just stay focused…it's going to be in everybody's head."
Lasco:"BYU game is going to be a huge game..Being able to win that &amp; play another game just for the seniors that's the most important thing"
Lasco is here. "hello, everybody," he says.
Lasco up next.
Everyone is healthy. Might see more of Jalen Jefferson. "Came out of the Stanford game remarkably healthy," Dykes says.
Dykes on BYU's recent soft schedule: "Truthfully, it's hard to walk away with a sense of 'okay, here's exactly where they are.'"
"They know the deal." Dykes says his players clearly understand the implications of the game.
Dykes doesn't want to "invent motivation."
Dykes on bowl game: "We're kind of a process oriented team..we want to focus on the process…and not focus on dangling a couple of carrots."
Dykes talking about deferring the 1st half kickoff, says the hope was to force a punt and get good field position. 

Stanford scored a TD.
Dykes on starting fast: "It always makes it easier….It just makes everything easier…It brings out the best in your team."
Dykes says bowl game is important because it allows them to keep practicing, and they need the practices. Talks about Stanford's experience.
Dykes: "We have to win this ballgame, because, number one: its a game we can win."
Dykes: "I've certainly had to go back and think about the way I was going to view things, regardless of the outcome on Saturday."
what you're getting into.You want the same level of accountability to exist within the conference.. I applaud them for taking action." (2/2)
Dykes: "We have to answer to media, alums, boosters, fans, and players as coaches…When you operate in this world, you know (1/2)
Dykes says most coaches are for replay. "It's like the old adage: you better be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it."
Dykes:First of all, officiating a college football game is hard. Especially a fast paced game that has as many plays as they have these days
Dykes says BYU looks like Stanford. Big, physical, long.
Sonny Dykes is here.
@peteblackburn both Crush and Fanta should be Orange only.
Pple drink grape soda? MT “@NextImpulse: Rodgers shuts up critics for his grape soda incident

@bystephenhobbs ok ok ok i take it back
@bystephenhobbs in the thick of it I see ;)
Clark: "This team we're about to play, they beat the crap out of Texas. Regardless if they have their (qb), they're still a great team."
Clark on the BYU tape: "Similar to Arizona in what they do. Pretty big o-line, except the center."
Clark on penalties: "Play smarter. We are a pretty young team. Just a lot of guys who haven't been put in those types of situations."
Clark on slow starts: "Things just haven't gone out way. Ball hasn't bounced our way. Penalties have killed us just about every game."
Clark: "I think as a player, obviously we'd love to go 11-0, but coming off the season we had…we wouldn't have it any other way."
Austin Clark up next.
"I don't think that's the reason we lost the game." — Goff on the officiating last week.
"I don't think we've lost any confidence…We've finished all the games really well." — Goff also emphasizes the need to start quickly.
"I don't know. It's been happening lately…I don't know if you can put it on a single common denominator." — Goff on slow starts.
Goff: "Everyone is ready to go this week. We've been through so much as a team."
Goff says they can't overhype it. "We don't be able to perform like we need to," if they overhype the game.
QB Jared Goff at the podium: "It's definitely going to be a big game. It's going to decide if we're going to a bowl game."
@RillBeck 
I wrote something about the Iron Bowl

TORTURED FANBASE!!! RT “@scarroll43: My heart is breaking with the news of Sandoval <PANDA FACE><BROKEN HEART>”
Reminder that there were TONS of analysts and fans who wanted the Bears to sign Josh McCown long term over Jay Cutler.
"Cal lost to Stanford because they were clearly the inferior team." 
@kileykmiec "WATCH" or "VIDEO" would've been appreciated. Definitely just opened that in class.
only positive part about transcribing is listening to yourself interview someone and realizing all the times you messed up. #taleofthetape
Matthew Stafford went 18-of-46 today.
@sngyn92 update your bio man
@PeteBlackburn what is a Waltham
@sngyn92 @michaelrosen3 yo your website seungylee doesn't work.
Apparently Donnell can't jump.
@michaelrosen3 awk. 
Fitz has more than 9 lives MT “@McClain_on_NFL: Mallett played with injury to his right pectoral muscle, could be lost for several weeks.”
@riley_mcatee #freesonnyfromwhat?
Completely dominated that entire game. Their only shot of the 2nd half goes in. Dammit.
"We might just park the bus. We might just take a family photo." — commentator after Texas A&amp;M goal.
Whoever is doing the ND-Texas A&amp;M game on WatchESPN just said "we" when talking about Texas A&amp;M. Thanks for making that clear.
More late-game magic. #GoIrish
YES!!!!!!!
Refs on the Bears bandwagon too. All aboard.
The Bears might not ever lose again.
I have the worst upstairs neighbors in the history of mankind.
@ryantwong616 you got it, yo!
The Bears are beating Lovie Smith's team by playing terrible offense, forcing turnovers, then scoring on a short field.
@ryantwong616 i've never heard you say "yo." big day.
And another drop. 2nd drop by Marquess Wilson on a 3rd down.
My sister's team plays in the Sweet 16 at 1130. Was a bit worried about missing part of the Chi game, but now I see I won't be missing much.
@peteblackburn you're having too much fun. stop.
@nflosophy he's missed one pass because of accuracy. The bigger issue is the line.
This game plan is awful. Not moving Cutler to help the offensive line, Forte not involved, blah.
@fbgchase make it stop.
And another drop.
@_marcusd_ yup. oddly it was Marshall too.
People will blame the opening play calling, but if not for a bad dropped pass, the Bears are still on the field.
No idea why I'm doing this: if DET loses to NE today (likely) &amp; CHI beats TB (ehh) &amp; the Bears beat DET nxt wk, Bears will be 1 back of DET.
@sngyn92 are you not entertained?
Cal football forums tonight. 
Lawler not coming to podium anymore. Concludes press conference.
Should reach 1,000 next wk MT “@RGBearTerritory: With 103 rushing yards today, @DLasco2 earned his 4th career 100-yard rushing performance”
"I never really know how much I'm going to play going into a game." — Rubenzer.
Lasco on his fumble: "I thought maybe I'd try to split them, and try to use my momentum… placed his head perfectly on the ball.
Dykes also said Lowe's ejection affected both him and the team. Wishes it hadn't.
"20 years I've never seen that happen on the first play of the game. That's a tough call on the first play of the ballgame." Dykes on Lowe.
"We'll see what we're made of as a team." Dykes on next week's season finale against BYU. Needs a win to be bowl eligible.
"Looking at the numbers, it's not one of his best games." Dykes on Goff's day. Says they'll look at the film to better evaluate.
Dykes: "It was frustrating. It was really frustrating."
Dykes mentions getting bull-rushed by Stanford's defensive line.
"Wanted to make sure we didn't get Jared hurt." Dykes on playing Rubenzer.
"I'm not going to say much about that whole thing….It was shameful to myself, but it is what it is." Dykes on the 3 TDs being overturned."
Sonny Dykes give Stanford credit. "Their coaching staff did a better job getting their players ready."
"After the second one, you're like really?" - McClure on the TDs being overturned in the 3rd quarter.
"It doesn't really matter what the offense does. It's our job to keep them out of the end zone."— McClure on the offense's turnover issues.
McClure is up. "That was a tough blow, just to deal with on the first play of the game." McClure on Lowe's ejection.
Goff: "We don't feel like the gap is as big as the score was. We didn't play up to our potential…We shot ourselves in the foot all day."
Goff: "Nothing really affects it." Goff on this rhythm when Rubenzer was subbed in.
Jared Goff: "Obviously, disappointed. But we got one more next week and a chance to go to a bowl game after that."
38-17. I hope no one is blaming the officials.
Is that good? RT “@M_Vernon: Updated last three Big Games. #Stanford 122, #Cal 33.”
Penalty count: 12-113.
@avinashkunnath yeah, well the Cal offense is good, the Cal defense is putrid.
@avinashkunnath offense with an equally awful game.
@avinashkunnath four turnovers more to blame.
Near disaster in the press box. @Riley_McAtee knocks over @scarroll43's diet pepsi. Narrowly misses her laptop. Disaster averted.
9 penalties for Cal so far. Just over their season average of 8.8, but still 8 minutes left.
Don't be sad Cal fans. At least the @dailycal beat the @stanford_daily in the Ink Bowl!
Quotes from the press box: Stay in bounds.
If I'm Goff, I'm like "Why is Rubenzer throwing fades over me?"
That was fun.
TD, review, TD, review, TD, review, onside kick recovery, review.
Football stuff is happening at Memorial Stadium right now.
And remember, Harper should have had a punt return for a TD. Ran straight into the punter.
New rule: 1 point per touchdown.
Cal scores 3 TDs, gets 3 points.
On 3 straight plays, Cal scores a TD, then has it overturned.
LOL.
Kenny Lawler is going to be an excellent pro one today.
I've criticized Cal all season long for their sloppy play. Absolutely terrible one there.
Play overturned. Which means that penalty is just awful for Cal. Will be 3rd down from the 16, not the 1 because of it.
In case you were wondering, Cal averages 8.8 penalties per game.
I appreciate the fact that @lukerubenzer8 has @zachklineQB's  old number and also sports the Kilne-esque head band.
Looked like corners were playing man, and the safeties were back deep — cover 2, man under. Can't throw that pass. Safety is waiting for it.
Could see that INT by Rubenzer coming for a long time. Safety was in the hole, waiting for Rubenzer to throw it.
Penalties on Cal? shocker
Bryce McGovern has six tackles, which is nice for him, but not so nice for Cal.
4 turnovers and counting.
In case anyone wants to watch some good soccer, this is happening tomorrow. 
Please stop playing Stanford band.
Cue the Arizona hail mary highlights.
Not very Sonny in Cal right now.
@michaelrosen3 you win.
48 seconds until a bunch of "the band is on the field" tweets.
Goff should've been picked on that one. Too high for Anderson, Stanford DB just dropped it. #Goffwatch
Cal's offense: 7 points, 3 turnovers. Can't really blame the defense.
#timing 
pick.
Either Hogan thought Rector was going to turn vertical or that ball just got completely away from him.
Whoops.
.@CalBand killing it with the Game of Thrones music.
Breaking: Cal can't defend the screen.
.@Riley_McAtee is freaked.
There is a wasp in the press box. Uh oh.
Really think Lawler has the most NFL potential out of any Cal receiver. Hands are very Alshon Jeffery-esque
was just saying to @scarroll43 that I was curious to see what Dykes would do if it came down to a 4th down. Then that happened. oh well.
Well.
FGs are wins for Cal's defense.
Cal can't defend the middle of the field right now. Receiver sitting in the gap between the LBs and safeties.
Sweet timing by Treggs and Goff.
Feel bad for Lowe, but not sure how the refs could have called that differently.
On Stanford's big run on that drive, they lined in power — no wide outs on the play. Going right at the defense.
@CalRivals @michaelrosen3 35-9
And, here, we, go 
Great last day of Ink Bowl practice. Expecting nothing less than a W. Game is tomorrow at 9 a.m. at Willard Park. #wewanttheknife
On to the next round! #GoIrish

2nd half urgency shot count: 2 mentions. 44 minutes left.
@peteblackburn #engagement
Unreal run and cross by Muya.
THERE WE GO. 1-1. #GoIrish
It's annoying when an analyst's only solution for a losing team is "urgency." Just be more urgent you guys.
Dammit. An inch away from 1-0. #GoIrish
Could be sleeping. Writing a feature instead. #klinetime
@peteblackburn a lot of GIFs
This is the best football thing I've ever seen in my life. 
HAHAHAHHA Raiders.
@peteblackburn nice subliminal Next Impulse advertising there.
@sngyn92 unless it's thrown to Bmarsh or Alshon
@sngyn92 how did you find this tweet?
Side note: TDAGARIM was released exactly eight years ago.
@sully1289 well it's Brand New. So, i'm guessing that's entirely the point.
this is the most brand new thing ever 
@propertyofzack that makes sense. thanks, appreciated.
@propertyofzack question, how do you guys know it'll be out in 2015?
Brand New makes new website and releases new….merch :(
This is as good as a WS, right? RT “@MLB: The @Mariners are the 2014 recipient of the Commissioner’s Award for Philanthropic Excellence.”
Aside from the ridiculous Tommen-Stephen A. comparison, this is great. 
@NFLosophy Gruden and Tirico is perfect however.
@NFLosophy Stephen A. as tommen? Nope.
.@michaelrosen3 @m_vernon this? 
@michelle_e_lee when people use W-L AND THEN exclude a QB's best W-L season….
@peteblackburn but who is doing the hockey GIFs tonight?
@cousinvinnieb let's just erase his rookie season and use a team's W-L as a the metric to judge QBs….
Nope. MT “@TJCarpenterWHB: RG3 is worse than JaMarc Russell at this point in his career. let that sink in. 
@ryantwong616 no.
Just made my creative writing class talk about Jay Cutler for 45 minutes.
Oh Gronk. It didn't end well for the Colts player.
