@JGWP @JadeTNA I agree. Her talent deserves to SHINE bright and proud.
Er... nevermind. -_-
@BulletClubNJPW This pic is just too damn sweet! #BulletClub
@JGWP This Dollhouse is dangerous... but Gail shall have her revenge. :o
@CatherineNikita @NowJenn @KyleKiaree @lizzie20114 I think he won it at the taping on Sunday night. I recall reading the spoiler.
@JadeTNA Dammit Jade! LOL
@aberdango69 January 23 edition of Impact. Kong came out to confront Havok before she could do any further damage to Gail.
@AgatioGanon I often find myself in the same situation.
@ratetank That's pretty awesome! :)
@AgatioGanon Sleep? What's that? :)
今はクリスさんが
守ってくれます！
自分達はいつでも待ってます！
ゆっくり体を仕上げてから
リングに上がって下さい！ 
@Lex2018 Japanese soccer video game?
"Wrestling is fake," then you're kicked in the face and learn how real it is.
@JadeTNA The #Dollhouse will pay for its sins! :)
That time Azumi Hyuga murdered Kayoko Haruyama at the opening bell... 
@dedysilveria Good things come to those who wait. At least we will learn the results quickly.
@lizzie20114 It's always the best ones. :(
@stardomchelsea and @kairi_hojo use the name Candy Crush for their tag-team? :) #Stardom
@NowJenn @KyleKiaree @CatherineNikita @lizzie20114 So many Knockouts returning to the spotlight.
@lizzie20114 Wait. He could be out for good? That's terrible. So many injuries in wrestling this year. :(
@lizzie20114 What happened to Daniel Bryan? Is he injured?
Respect is due to the @IMPACTWRESTLING roster of professional wrestlers busting their asses over the past several nights in Orlando.
@dedysilveria The event on 5/17 should be very exciting. Intriguing card of matches.
@dedysilveria Yes, Satomura is always a tough challenge. Let's see what Chelsea can do. :)
@KMiles1000 Brooke had an in-ring segment with Taryn.
@dedysilveria Chelsea seems popular with the fans.
@dedysilveria It amazes me at times.
@KMiles1000 Brooke was involved tonight. :)
@KMiles1000 It is my understanding that she did not.
I resolve to remain hopeful and optimistic about Stardom! :) #StardomLove
@TheQueenBrooke @lizzie20114 Let's wait and see what happens on Impact. You never know. :)
@lizzie20114 You guys had me fooled believing Brooke had won the title. :(
@dedysilveria At this rate Stardom won't have enough wrestlers left on its roster to hold an event.
@dedysilveria WTF?
Essential viewing for fans of real pro wrestling! #ProWresLove  
@lizzie20114 I believe it's June 28. :o
I can't wait for June 6 to arrive. @smashwrestling
@lizzie20114 The next PPV is Slammiversary in June.
@bull2474 The DQ win only coming after she was completely destroyed.
Gail Kim's victories on Impact for 2015:

*defeated Havok via DQ
*defeated Angelina 

That is all.
@NowJenn @KyleKiaree @CatherineNikita @lizzie20114 Will the marks stop crying their eyes out now?
@kennethevane325 Blocked! You're clueless.
@lostmikeys No women in three hours? Typical WWE. Oops. Sorry TNA.
@wolfinjapan You look amazing! :)
Any sign of spoilers from tonight's Impact Wrestling taping in Orlando?
@CatherineNikita But did you see the clip of Jiaying and Skye talking? Skye has a big decision to make.
@CatherineNikita Yeah, in the promo for tomorrow's episode, we see Skye fighting against May. She even uses her powers. Tricks again?
Knock @gailkimITSME down, even try to keep her there, but eventually she will rise again and give her rivals a taste of their own medicine.
@CatherineNikita Not that I am aware of at present. Might be a bit early for a synopsis, but I hope the Inhumans story continues in some way
@CatherineNikita Me too. No doubt he's a baddie. I'm also curious about the Kree stone and how it could wipe out the Inhumans? :o
@CatherineNikita Ward and Kara captured Bobbi though. O.O
@CatherineNikita That sucks big time. I bet a Mockingbird series would be interesting to see. :(
@CatherineNikita Skye is so caught in the middle.
@NowJenn @KyleKiaree @CatherineNikita @lizzie20114 I wonder what is being filmed. An interview of some sort?
@alphafemale1 That's pretty awesome!
@beyondwrestling 5 or 6. 7 might be pushing it.
@King_Ghidorah He's shared OZ Academy, Ice Ribbon, SENDAI... and maybe JWP too but I'm not cetain. Over a period of time.
@NowJenn @KyleKiaree @CatherineNikita @lizzie20114 Rebel still exists.
@King_Ghidorah Yes, he did. Can't wait to check it out.
@ShirlShocked Congratulations!
@JadeFansiteCom @BrittanyTNA @JadeTNA I'm a fan of both wrestlers. They will have a great match for the title. Who wins? The fans. :)
@King_Ghidorah I look forward to watching the 5/5 REINA event. :)
@CatherineNikita One more sleep until the 2-hour #AgentsofSHIELD season finale! It's going to be insane, but so is the wait for season 3.
@1HardcoreMJFan @faceones Bully returned for one night.
@SoCalValerie @boatingmagazine Gorgeous! Have a wonderful time. :)
@Lex2018 Yeah, Stardom uploaded a video clip. Sad news.
@JamesStormBrand @IMPACTWRESTLING Might this involve beer bottles breaking on @MagnusOfficial head? :)
@SoCalValerie Hallelujah! :-)
@1HardcoreMJFan Maybe she will return at tonight's taping?
@MeaganG1990 So much action for the wrestlers! How do they do it? :)
Is there another Impact Wrestling taping set for today, or are they done for now?
@dj1995dj1 @CatherineNikita @TheQueenBrooke @MeaganG1990 @lizzie20114 Finally found them at this link... 
@dedysilveria Damn! That kick didn't miss its target at all.
@dedysilveria ... and a knee to the face! O.O
@muto_keiji It looks delicious. :)
@WidowsPEAKED Yikes! I never want to see it again. My first time seeing that film was in a theatre. :(
@WidowsPEAKED The one movie that legit scared me.
#TNA #Caricature 
Ain't nothin' to **** with.. #BDC @The305MVP @OneWorldWarrior  
Mayu Iwatani reminds Kairi Hojo that she isn't here to play games! 
@Lex2018 Not sure yet if this news is 100% legit. Might be.
@natsislost @ultimokicks I saw this match live in person. :)
@Serena_xoxo13 @LaRosaMendes @RealPaigeWWE @AliciaFoxy Holy smokes! Awesome pic.
Why wasn't security present to prevent Velvet Sky from entering the ring to attack a wrestler on the TNA roster? She was fired.
Wow. @ActualALove has better watch her step from now on if what happened with @VelVelHoller is any indication. Friends no more.
I love @TheEricYoung, but he allowed @REALBully5150 to be too much of a distraction, and it cost him a chance at @RealKurtAngle World Title.
I'm a fan of #BDC. They're honest and do what they say they're going to do. They don't care if you don't like it. What is this #Rising?
What I'd like to know is what is really going on between @MickieJames and @JamesStormBrand that @MagnusOfficial doesn't know about?
The in-ring segment with #DirtyHeels and #Wolves was my favourite. Two great tag-teams about to do battle in an exciting series of matches.
Why was #KimKong vs. the #Dollhouse a handicap tag-team match anyway? I just wish it were longer. They really have Gail and Kong's number.
Just finished watching this past week's @IMPACTWRESTLING which I thoroughly enjoyed. Sad news about Homicide though. That sucks. :( #BDC
EC3 vs. Anderson, in a falls count anywhere match with no dq, yet tbe ref wants to prevent Tyrus inteference and orders him out of the ring?
@senorsol72 Sounds like WWE.
@mesha_gucci WWE fans unprepared for their eventual rude awakening. Just kidding. :)
@dedysilveria I wonder who might eventually dethrone Kayoko Haruyama.
@dedysilveria I guess it's still possible she could tie if not break the record. The only active wrestler close behind her is Nakajima.
Someone said Haruyama is closing in on Hyuga's record for combined JWP Openweight Title reigns. 1,797 days vs. 994+ days. A long way to go.
LOL Marti on the mic though.
@dj1995dj1 @CatherineNikita @TheQueenBrooke @MeaganG1990 @lizzie20114 It seems we are still waiting. :(
@CatherineNikita More detailed spoilers from last night's taping. 
Kyoko Kimura is out with a broken wrist? :( #Stardom
@dedysilveria Thanks for the link. I just re-watched the match.
@CatherineNikita Someone is asleep at the wheel.
@CatherineNikita Better late than never?
@dedysilveria Momoe, Nanae and Ito vs. LCO and Maekawa.
So looking forward to the #DirtyHeels vs. #Wolves best-of-five series for the tag-team titles. Should be exciting matches. But a repeat?
@dedysilveria Remember Momoe in those cage matches versus LCO?
@dedysilveria That NJPW match was rather enjoyable.
ROH/NJPW and SMASH next weekend. One I've never seen live and the other I've been to every non-TV taping event since July.
@dedysilveria Is this the match where Ayako won the title?
@Lex2018 Stardom wrestlers heading to Mexico for DragonMania later this month. Shirai, Iwatani, Hojo. I think Koguma's going too. Not sure.
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 I think it's in two weeks, but we will have to wait and see.
@Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah Brooke and Rebel vs. Marti and Jade is set for next Friday night.
@Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah No. In two or three weeks, I guess.
@lostmikeys Slammiversary is set for June 28 on PPV, right?
@lostmikeys They're taping through to 2020. lol
@badboicasey @lostmikeys There's one tomorrow too? :o
@badboicasey @lostmikeys Bit late for that.
The 5/22 edition of Impact will be three hours?!
@VampNikki Booooooooooooo! #FreeNikki
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Gail loses 95% of the time so I'm not surprised.
@MRayneTNA The coolest mother... ever! :)
This song goes out all mothers in the world... 
@MRayneTNA @MickieJames @TheTarynTerrell @TNADixie Happy Mother's Day one and all. Hope you're having a great day. Have I missed anyone?
My favourite things about #Stardom right now: Kairi Hojo and Mayu Iwatani, Io Shirai and Koguma. 5/17 should prove rather interesting.
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Boooooo! We want the spoilers... because we're impatient and can't wait for it all to air on TV. lol
@stardomchelsea @MASA_PASSION Such an exciting time to be a fan of Stardom. :)
@LuFisto @WSUWrestling Their loss, not yours. What an injustice.
@badboicasey I'm a fan of his.
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 Gail Kim competing in a steel cage match at tonight's taping in Orlando. No idea who her opponent might be.
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Oh, I do wonder. If Taryn were Gail's opponent, does this mean the title is up for grabs? Title vs. Record?
@Wwe5Fan Against whom? :o
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Love that idea. My heart is racing. :o
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Imagine if it's Gail vs. Taryn, with the Dollhouse banned, but then they're under the ring and interfere. O.O
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Wait. What? Against Kong or Taryn? O.O
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Perhaps they're taping tonight as they've done the previous two nights, or fans are just being lazy.
@MissFitDanyah @smashwrestling You look amazing! Can't wait to see you wrestle. :)
@1HardcoreMJFan At some point tonight, I guess.
@AlexxiaaNicole This is a crime!
@RobertIrvine @gailkimITSME Be careful around the #Dollhouse. Those three aren't playing with a full deck at all. Not at all. Good luck. :)
@MeaganG1990 You don't mess with a woman and her salad.
@RealKingRegal Happy Birthday! Hope you're having an awesome celebration.
@MeaganG1990 I have two.
@gailkimITSME Love this pic. Such a beautiful couple. You look amazing in your wedding dress too. :)
@MeaganG1990 New Yorkers in the house, I see. :-)
@stu_dos @A1Wrestling @PlayerUno Congratulations! Such a talented tag-team is more than deserving of championship gold. Long may you reign.
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING Happy Mother's Day to the awesome women of TNA. :)
Sometimes all you want to do is watch Azumi Hyuga matches!
Happy Mother's Day to all mothers in the world. :)
Happy Third Anniversary to an awesome couple. @gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine  
@stardomchelsea @wolfinjapan Be careful. She might bite you. :)
I kinda wish the Knockouts Division had a bigger roster, so we could see @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA reign as tag-team champions!
@dj1995dj1 Most curious so it is.
@dj1995dj1 You will have to wait and see... or check spoilers from tonight's taping.
Gail vs. the Dollhouse already better than Diva storylines on Raw and SD.
@numero0047 @CatherineNikita There is no indication it was taped for Xplosion.
@CatherineNikita Marti vs. Rebel taped tonight as well.
@CatherineNikita @MeaganG1990 @lizzie20114 Perhaps we might see her involved with Angelina somehow at Sunday's taping (if there is one).
@lizzie20114 @CatherineNikita Dunno. Bully tweeted me that his return was a one night deal. :o
@CatherineNikita Perhaps we are already witnessing the impact Billy Corgan has on creative? I wonder if this were Gail and Taryn's idea.
@CatherineNikita Should be interesting to see what happens. In other unexpected news, Rebel is still on the active roster. lol
@CatherineNikita Gail needs a friend to help her out alongside Kong. Bring back Havok. That would look weird though.
@CatherineNikita Gail vs. Taryn in a Robert on a Pole match. :p
@CatherineNikita Here I thought Robert said he didn't want to be involved with wrestling, or at least in the ring competing, I guess. :o
The Knockouts spoilers from tonight's taping though... o.O
@CatherineNikita WTF at this development... :o
Impact Wresting 5/8/15 Gail Kim &amp; Awesome Kong vs The Dollhouse 
@gailkimITSME What will they think of next?
@theprinceofny You're the best. :)
@badboicasey Let's send white people back to Europe. :)
@TheaTrinidadTMT That's awesome news! :)
@smashwrestling @suavewrestling Booooooooo! #FourthGunn shall pay for this.
@lizzie20114 I shall watch last night's Impact at some point today. :)
@lizzie20114 Is there a taping today? :)
@etchedindust @gailkimITSME @TheTarynTerrell Have you seen their single match from One Night Only: Rivals? If not, check it out. :)
Impact Wrestling 05/08/15 The Dollhouse vs Gail Kim &amp; Awesome Kong 
Impact Wrestling 05/08/15 Gail Kim &amp; Taryn Terrell Backstage Segment 
Impact Wrestling 05/08/15 Gail Kim &amp; Awesome Kong Backstage Segment 
@dedysilveria Like seeing Yoshiko on a Stardom poster.
@REALBully5150 I wish you and @VelVelHoller all the best in the world. :)
#TheWolves (@RichardsWesley @TheEddieEdwards) vs. #DirtyHeels (@AustinAries @REALBobbyRoode) in a best-of-5 series for the tag belts? YES!
It's clear @TheTarynTerrell has no issues making this very personal with @gailkimITSME. What next for the KO Champion and her #Dollhouse?
LOL @TheTarynTerrell buying a ticket to @RobertIrvine show and taking selfies with his daughters, then getting into it with @gailkimITSME.
@Lex2018 There is another MIO event in Japan today. Mio is also retiring her KAGUYA persona. An interesting twist.
@IMPACTWRESTLING Happy to see @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA given this oppportunity, as well as @TheTarynTerrell in the spotlight. Get it.
@dedysilveria Takumi Iroha is healthy enough to return? Initial reports stated she would be sidelined for 8 months.
@Lex2018 Io Shirai over Nikki Storm for the vacant white belt and Kairi Hojo to retain the red belt over Mayu Iwatani. Predictions.
@REALBully5150 Welcome back to the wild world of Impact Wrestling.
Chelsea, Kairi Hojo and Mayu Iwatani vs. Io Shirai, Koguma and Kaori Yoneyama. World Champion and Challenger on the same team ahead of 5/17.
Oh, good heavens! I must have cut too close to the bone.
@LAWradio @WeeklyWPodcast This is ridiculous, but at least it's still airing albeit in a pitiful timeslot.
@HAVOKTNA @NowJenn @MRayneTNA All sunshine and rainbows, I see.
@Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah @gailkimITSME @JadeTNA Let's see these two throw down at Slammiversary. #wishfulthinking #dreamland
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 Can't wait to see this match. This isn't over by a longshot. :) #KimKong #Dollhouse
@mesha_gucci Speak (tweet?) your mind. :)
@Barefoot24 Perfect "caption this" material.
@Lex2018 Woohoo! Tweet your reaction post-match. :)
@Lex2018 Often used by the Young Bucks.
@mesha_gucci It's white people complaining, right?
That double team moved used by Thunder Rock, though. :o
@mesha_gucci People scrape the floorboards for reasons to complain. It's sad really.
@Msmelsantos Haha! What a beauty you are though. :)
@Lex2018 Did you see the KO match tonight? I haven't watched yet. :(
@Evie_NZ Looks delicious! :)
@theprinceofny How are you? Hope all is well. :)
I love it when selfish fans piss and moan because their personal bias isn't in the spotlight 24-7-365.
@stardomchelsea Such a beautiful photo! Have an awesome time in Osaka, champ! :)
Remember when Taryn called out Gail on Open Fight Night and Kim hit her from behind with the mic?
@ChickfightsRock @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK @MartiBellTNA @JadeTNA the #Dollhouse must be plotting their revenge as we tweet.
@AntiDiva4Life10 @VelVelHoller looks like she could flip out at any second.
@mesha_gucci Been feeling the same.
@MeaganG1990 A real feud this time.
@MeaganG1990 Angelina vs. Velvet, perhaps? :o
@JGWP I've been to every Smash event since last July... excluding their Smash TV tapings. But my first time was in 2013.
@JGWP Smash is always a fun time. :)
Is Velvet back for TBP part 7,452?
I have my VIP ticket bought. Can't wait to support these talented wrestlers. #GiveDivasAChance #WeCallThemWrestlers 
#DirtyHeels vs. #Wolves will be an awesome series of tag-team WRESTLING matches! Thank you @TNADixie. #IMPACTLive  
The Wolves vs. Biff Busick and Drew Gulak at Smash Wrestling was an awesome tag-team match to witness live in person! @smashwrestling
@MeaganG1990 As always. :)
@MeaganG1990 Exactly. :)
@MeaganG1990 Toronto 7-0 Boston... lol
@DaveMuscarella A Death Machine awaits? O.O
.@gailkimITSME We demand a #KimKong vs. #Dollhouse rematch. Book it. :) #IMPACTLive
@gailkimITSME and @MeanQueenK attacking @MartiBellTNA after the match. @TheTarynTerrell and @JadeTNA are not amused, yet still victorious.
@DaveMuscarella For whatever inexplicable reason.
Gail is pinned and loses. This happens a lot. -_-
Ummm... @JadeTNA and @gailkimITSME in the ring at the same time... and one of them isn't a referee this time. #IMPACTLive
@AllHailGailKim Are you marking? lol
@HAVOKTNA Slew them! Slew them all. #IMPACTLive
These women do not play nice at all. #Dollhouse  
@AllHailGailKim #Dollhouse forever, Gabby...
@King_Ghidorah The KO match is on now!
Those masks the #BDC were wearing are often found in Japan's Noh theatre. @The305MVP
@King_Ghidorah You haven't missed the match. Only a backstage segment with Gail and Kong.
At least @gailkimITSME and @MeanQueenK aren't best friends all of a sudden.
@CatherineNikita @CattiesWrestlin Let's wait and see what happens in the match tonight. :o
@CattiesWrestlin @CatherineNikita Maybe Taryn was right. Perhaps Gail really is all alone. :)
@dedysilveria I hope each event is able to draw decent attendance numbers.
@TNADixie @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK Can they co-exist long enough to secure victory over the #Dollhouse? #IMPACTLive
@mesha_gucci You missed Bully's return.
Gail and Kong backstage... #KimKong #IMPACTLive
@dedysilveria I wonder if anyone would be able to attend all three events, or if that's totally impossible to pull off.
@AllHailGailKim Psycho Eric Young as World Champion? I can dig it.
@fightnet I guess TNA has been given the boot this week. Not fair to Canadian fans. @TNADixie @IMPACTWRESTLING
@CatherineNikita @MaggieQ has such bad luck it seems. So sad. :(
@badboicasey Hey, it's Aces &amp; 8s all over again. Let's bring back Brooke Hogan and powerbomb Dixie through a table.
@AgatioGanon Jeff Jarrett? Hahahaha :)
@badboicasey Jenna Morasca...
@RonHutchison1 @gailkimITSME @CACReunion This is a nice pic. :)
@badboicasey Ya can't fool me. :)
Wait. What? Super exciting news, Robert. :) 
@badboicasey Are you at the TNA event?
@gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK Good luck against #Dollhouse tonight. Time for @TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA to face the music.
@KarlWPickup @KennyKingPb2 @OneWorldWarrior Wow. These are so awesome. Nice work.
@lostmikeys Is he at least content in doing so?
But... Meiko's educated feet though... o.O
Damn! Chelsea vs. Meiko Satomura? Really? O.O #Stardom
@DaveMuscarella Wow. This is a surprise.
@DaveMuscarella Lucha Underground?
@CatherineNikita @badboicasey Taped live. lol
@RobertIrvine @gailkimITSME Have a great time watching Gail kick butt tonight. :)
#FF @AllHailGailKim because she's awesome! :)
Attn. Canadian wrestling fans... :) 
@PaisleyPaddy I see Dixie tweeted that there are only 8 names to choose from.
@BaneofWrestling A pro of 8 years. Her sister Mio as well.
If Io Shirai defeats Nikki Storm, for the white belt on 5/17, she will have won every championship in Stardom. She's only 25 years old too.
@cherrrybomb @VerizonWireless This calls for a BSE. -_-
I look forward to seeing who this mystery person is later tonight. :) 
HA! I see what you did there. 
Canadian fans tune-in before #IMPACTLive.  
@KOREANKOCHAMP Hope you have a great day. :)
@PaisleyPaddy Oops. I forgot to include Samoa Joe on my list. -_-
@PaisleyPaddy Not on the list... 
Sabin? Foley? RVD? Bully? Styles? Sting? The choices are slim if the special guest referee is not on the current roster. #IMPACTLive
So much truth here. 
It's the #Dollhouse vs. #KimKong tonight on #IMPACTLive. @TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK
@KOREANKOCHAMP Happy Birthday! :)
@REALLiSAMARiE @MattJackson13 @NickJacksonYB This pic is just too sweet.
@AmericanAlucard You're ruining my fun. :)
Friday is here again! Can't wait for #IMPACTLive.
@brydertna @RealKurtAngle @TheEricYoung Jeff Jarrett. :)
@gailkimITSME Fingers crossed. :)
@gailkimITSME Might we see your t-shirt on #IMPACTLive? :)
Nikki Storm vs. Io Shirai for the vacant Wonder of Stardom Title on 5/17. Who's your pick to win the white belt? @NikkiStorm1 @shirai_io
@wwr_stardom Ohmukai's looking good these days.
I was going to re-watch Io vs. Natsuki since it's their respective birthday's. But oh well. That's the Internet for you.
@CatherineNikita @gailkimITSME Wooo! Agent Carter renewed as well. :)
@gailkimITSME I love #FreshOffTheBoat. So glad it's been given a second season. :)
@EthanCarterTNA I voted for Arm Wrestling. #IMPACTLive

Poll: What Stipulation Should The EC3 vs Mr. Anderson Match Be Contested Under? 
@TNAsylum That's unfortunate.
@TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA The #Dollhouse like to use jawbreakers on their opponents. @gailkimITSME prefers Eat Defeat. :)
Let the guessing game begin... 
I enjoy giving eggs five seconds of fame on Twitter before blocking them.
@joshuatwiggings As fake as your Twitter account.
@joshuatwiggings I am well aware of that simple fact. Thank you.
@Nemo3john @OldWrestlingPic @WCWWorldwide @Thaoriginalgata Wow. This is so awesome!
@LanaWWE Russian women are perfect. :)
@badboicasey AJ went back in time and invented the necklace.
@JadeFansiteCom @JadeTNA Awesome work on the website. It looks fantastic. :)
@JadeFansiteCom That's awesome! Exciting news. :)
Happy Birthday @shirai_io. Have an amazing day. お誕生日おめでとうございます
@gailkimITSME One more sleep until #IMPACTLive. Hurry up! :)
@gailkimITSME @brydertna I've found ignoring them is the best route for me as a fan. No idea why their existence should matter to me.
@RobertIrvine Time to rock 'n' roll. :)
@SeleziyaSparx Murderer!
@badboicasey Picture it.
@DestAmerica @IMPACTWRESTLING No Rope Barbed Wire Exploding Time Bomb Double Hell Death Match. Just kidding, people! :)
@Lagana @fightbobby is my prediction. It would make sense. #DestinationIMPACT
@Evie_NZ Happy Birthday! Have a great day. :)
@IMPACTFansFR This could set-up a triple threat for the title at Slammiversary. Let's wait and see what happens this Friday night.
@TheEricYoung Save a piledriver for the ref if he steps out of line.
Who could this be? Lashley, perhaps? 
@The_Dalyxman Russo said something stupid? This wouldn't be a first.
Wait. GFW exists as more than just three letters?!
@lenayada You look great too. :)
Hahaha! Thunder Rock champions of the world. :) @blue02sky19  
#FourthGunn has the Gold @smashwrestling 
The numbers game works in your favour. #Dollhouse  
@MarkIrby1 @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK Nice work, Mark. :)
Thunder Rock (@shirai_io and @blue02sky19) are the new Goddesses of Stardom Champions! Congratulations! :) #Stardom  
@sammael697 This is the only correct answer. lol :)
What the hell are people tweeting about tonight?
@brydertna What is this programme about?
@bull2474 @smashwrestling A spectacle so rare it could be mistaken for a mirage. So exciting. :)
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine Is it available in bookstores? I'd love to buy one.
Some clips of @gailkimITSME vs. @MRayneTNA at IWR... 
Kay Lee Ray, Noam Dar, Crazzy Steve, Mandrews vs. Samuel Shaw, Madison Rayne, Dave Mastiff, Rampage Brown: 
@shirai_io You are the next tag-team champion! :) #Stardom
Thunder Rosa has been injured. Sad news. :( #Stardom  
@gailkimITSME @hemmepowered This looks delicious. :)
@bull2474 @smashwrestling Has Hero vs. Joe ever happened before?
@smashwrestling @HeidiLovelace @xAngieSkyex I look forward to seeing these talented wrestlers throw down for a second time. So good.
Watch IMPACT WRESTLING LIVE!  Next Friday on Destination America 
@BrieArmy Sleep? What's that?
@smashwrestling CANUSA rematch? :)
@smashwrestling I missed the June 6 announcements due to ongoing Internet issues. Time to check out your timeline. Bet it's awesome! :)
Holy ****! Now you've gone and done it @smashwrestling  
@RobertIrvine @gailkimITSME Have an awesome time tonight. Hope you enjoy seeing Age of Ultron. :)
@gailkimITSME How does it feel knowing one of your toughest rivals will be your tag-team partner this Friday night on Impact?
@gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK Will be able to trust each other long enough to secure victory? #TheDollhouse has three members as well.
@The305MVP @gailkimITSME Black Widow, Gail. :)
Silly Kanemoto. We know you lost the mask to Liger in 94. :-)
@gailkimITSME I hope to see Avengers: Age of Ultron in 3-D IMAX soon. Fingers crossed. :)
@ilyassking1 How much hugging will be involved?
Tiger Mask III? Who is under the mask? Koji Kanemoto? @LuchaWorldCup
@WWE__History @theprinceofny @JackieMooreTx should be in the HOF.
@smashwrestling @SamoaJoe I'm casting a vote for @Walking_Weapon.
I'm excited to find out what the card of matches will be. :) 
@gailkimITSME &amp; @REALLISAMARIE @ Cauliflower Alley Club Event | AfterBuzz TV 
@JewellsMalone The #HardcorePrincess shall dominate on June 6.
It was pretty cool seeing Killer Elite Squad (KES) wrestle on @ringofhonor television this past weekend.
The world champion @kairi_hojo looks fantastic here! :) 
I saw someone wearing a Sriracha t-shirt on Sunday. :o
@gailkimITSME You might be able to use your email to access FB to delete or deactivate the account.
5/2 IWR results from Ardmore, Oklahoma: @gailkimITSME defeated @MRayneTNA to become the inaugural IWR Diamonds Champion. :)
@gailkimITSME Look what I found on Google search, Gail. So cool. Imagine if there were a Knockouts anime series... 
@theprinceofny HA! What gave you that impression?
@mraynenetwork Very cool news. :)
@gailkimITSME Congratulations on your victory, Gail. :)

Pacquiao: 240 hits and 30 successful.

@Lex2018 Kairi Hojo, Koguma and Chelsea defeated Io Shirai, Mayu Iwatani and Reo Hazuki to win the trios tag-team titles.
@dedysilveria Congrats to Kairi, Koguma and Chelsea. Tag belts decision soon as well. :)
@kairi_hojo @koguma19980120 @stardomchelsea Congratulations! New champions. #Stardom
@EthanCarterTNA I'd rather re-watch your hair match with @RockstarSpud.
#OedoTai is growing again! @thunderrosa22 @peqeStarfire @kimurarock @wolfinjapan 
@dedysilveria Thunder Rosa and Starfire joined Oedo Tai?! #Stardom
EC3 would beat them both at the same time. @EthanCarterTNA  
@AllHailGailKim Wow. KES for the win!
@dedysilveria A good match then? :)
@AllHailGailKim @GregoryIron @ZachGowen Nice pic! :)
@NikkiStorm1 has made her #Stardom debut defeating Haruka Kato. 
@brydertna Wait 'til they sing the North Korean anthem. :)
@AllHailGailKim That's awesome! Nice to interact with another fan of Gregory Iron, as well. :)
@mauroranallo It's almost time to rock 'n' roll... :) #MayweatherPacquiao
@AllHailGailKim Recently returned from Japan. Who did she wrestle? :)
@BeckyLynchWWE I see what you did there.
@REALBully5150 No ropes barbed wire exploding time bomb death match. :-)
@AllHailGailKim Sounds like a great event. :)
@RickWWESignGuy @gailkimITSME Hahaha! Hope Gail saw your sign. :)
@JeremyBorash @RobertIrvine Your predictions, gentlemen? :) #MayweatherPacquiao
DAMN! That Arisa Nakajima vs. Kayoko Haruyama match. O.O
LOL! That's too funny. :) 
Xplosion: @gailkimITSME vs. @MRayneTNA 
@SashaBanksWWE Looking good. :)
The real winners of #MayweatherPacquiao will be those who successfully bet money on the victor!
@Lex2018 Yes, but whether they're able to co-operate long enough to seal the victory remains to be seen. :)
@magicimpact @HAVOKTNA This is true.
@aiwrestling Kick her Crazy ass, @MartiBellTNA.
@RockstarSpud You are still on that list. Nobody will ever take away the fact you won the X-Division Championship. Keep fighting!
@mraynenetwork That's awesome! :)
When will we see you killing these bitches again? :) 
@_DeonnaPurrazzo Beautiful day and beautiful badass woman! :)
@VampNikki @BrittanyTNA On top of the world.
@JadeTNA @JGWP "You can beg better than that."
I see @TheRealAlSnow has joined @realjoshmathews for commentary on this week's edition of @IMPACTWRESTLING. Let's see how this goes. :)
@JGWP @JadeTNA Don't end up like Go Go. lol
@mauroranallo The big night has arrived. Exciting. :)
@MRayneTNA @gailkimITSME I understand you ladies have a match on this week's Xplosion as well? Hope to see it. :)
Just watched @TheTarynTerrell KO Title defense against @RealBrookeAdams. #TheDollhouse are just too much. But @gailkimITSME and @MeanQueenK?
Impact Wrestling 05/01/15 Taryn Terrell vs Brooke 
Pacquiao vs. Mayweather? There's more entertainment value in a Ashley Massaro match.
@TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA #TheDollhouse have gold and aren't afraid to kick ass! But a threat looms! @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK
@KFabeConnection @Walking_Weapon Congratulations, Josh. Next it's the SMASH Championship, right? :)
@LeahVonDutch Like a boss! :)
Beautiful women! Hey, they all kick ass too. So badass! :) 
@TheRock Happy Birthday. Have an awesome special day.
@VampNikki @BrittanyTNA How many championships does she hold right now?
@smashwrestling @_banks @CandiceLeRae Interesting combination. I'm sure they will have a great match. :)
@gailkimITSME @MRayneTNA Show 'em what the Knockouts are all about, ladies! :) 
I'd hate to take a bite out of you. You're a cookie full of arsenic.
@mraynenetwork Some might say right on time. :)
@GoodGuyVic That's exciting news. Slammiversary is coming next month too.
Never thought we'd see the day when @MeanQueenK and @gailkimITSME were on the same team to oppose a common enemy: #TheDollhouse
Next week's @IMPACTWRESTLING is a live broadcast?
@mraynenetwork You never know what might happen.
Slammiversary is set for June 28. Click for details: 
Taryn Terrell vs. Brooke for the Knockouts Title, and Gail Kim has a new ally against the Dollhouse: 
@JustKelsey15 @gailkimITSME Remember those vignettes Kharma was given in WWE?
@Lex2018 Mayu was smart heading to the top through the ropes!
@gailkimITSME @MRayneTNA All the best at the event in Ardmore, ladies! Pleasant travels.
@NikkiStorm1 The Wonder of Stardom Title is yours for the taking! Time to add a golden touch to the galaxy. :)
@MeaganG1990 Taryn, Marti and Jade don't stand a chance. :)
@JadeTNA and @gailkimITSME in the ring at the same time without one of them being a special guest referee.
@gailkimITSME So is this going to be a handicap 3 vs. 2 match next week?
@sammael697 @wnwdotcom @MeanQueenK @gailkimITSME You called it. :)
@JGWP @Lex2018 Must-see television!
@gailkimITSME and @MeanQueenK as a team against @TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA next week. #Dollhouse 

So much is going on in @IMPACTWRESTLING.  

If you only knew... 

@MeaganG1990 Meagan will be shooting in her tweets soon enough. lol :)
@MeaganG1990 Easy now.
@MeaganG1990 Give Meagan the shoots before she shoots someone. :)
@gailkimITSME #TheDollhouse cannot be trusted, Gail. They aren't playing nice at all.
@Lex2018 Io vs. Mayu from the Cinderella Tournament. 
Syuri <COPYRIGHT SIGN> vs Marcela for the CMLL World Women's Championship 
@Lex2018 Two of those titles she's never held before.
@Lex2018 Three title matches have been announced for the 5/17 event. Should be interesting to see how it all plays out.

Angle vs Eric Young - Stretcher Match 

9/8c on @DestAmerica 

@gailkimITSME In Japan the school year starts in April.
@gailkimITSME @AnnaliseIrvine Yay! All the best today.
@HackerScotty Pacquiao for the win!
@gailkimITSME Happy 14th Birthday! Hope her day is an awesome one. :)
@NikkiStorm1 Wishing you all the best competing at Stardom. Time to conquer another galaxy. :)
@rossystardom Happy Birthday! :)
@BurttheHurt99 Sound advice. :)
@PaisleyPaddy @gailkimITSME @MRayneTNA Thanks for the heads up. :)
I just realized that three of Stardom's five championship titles are currently vacant.
@KOREANKOCHAMP All is okay. The weekend is upon us. Hope you have a good one.
Oh snap! @shirai_io vs. @NikkiStorm1 for the Wonder of Stardom Title is set for 5/17. Decision match. #Stardom  
@gailkimITSME Wish there were video of this. lol
@gailkimITSME @SuplexWrestling Awesome t-shirt, Gail. Love the design. :)

@smashwrestling Pretty cool re-watching Chris Hero vs. Takaaki Watanabe from Rival Schools on this week's edition of Smash TV.
This is a perfect tweet. Pleasant travels. 
@faceones Haha! I was just quoting a stranger who saw my t-shirt. :)
@TheWolvesNation I apologize. My remark was uncalled for.
"What is the Bullet Club?"
@JEFFHARDYBRAND Please take care and get well soon.
@TheWolvesNation @TurnbuckleMag A sense of humour isn't all that bad either.
@TurnbuckleMag Where the objective is to lose the tournament to avoid the curse of winning tag-team gold?
@TheTarynTerrell You and your friends don't play nice at all. #TheDollHouse
@k_a_n_a_ Very exciting. The best event. :)
I know who my #wcw is.
@MRayneTNA @VelVelHoller @ActualALove Now that's a helluva triple threat.


@TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA It's almost time to play again. #Dollhouse #DestinationIMPACT
@TNADixie Your tag-team titles are cursed.
Io Shirai vs. Mayu Iwatani made me want to see them wrestle a longer match.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?
@DaSilvaMMA @smashwrestling #FourthGunn business? Hmmm... #Gold2015
@PeachyHanwell Haha! Nice one. :)
Nikki Storm vs. Reo Hazuki on 5/6? Yes please! #Stardom
#Stardom has announced that the "Best Wrestler in the Galaxy" @NikkiStorm1 will wrestle Kato Yuki on May 3 in Tokyo.
@SoCalValerie Good morning, Val. Have a beautiful day.
Did Kairi Hojo and Nanae Takahashi vacate the tag-team titles? I'm confused by #Stardom's latest tweets. Awkward translations.
@ilyassking1 *starts chanting* Famous Artist! Famous Artist! :)
@kairi_hojo Wu-Tang! You are super muscular. :)
@King_Ghidorah This Wikipedia entry features all One Night Only results. No idea where to find one for Xplosion. 
@TheWolvesNation Eddie! You Sunnova Beech! 
@TheEddieEdwards @RichardsWesley Eddie! You Sunnova Beech! 
Wow. @HouseofHardcore is coming to Toronto on July 18. 
Friends of EC3 Release First Campaign Video for #EC3ForChamp 
@DrewGulak Happy Birthday!
I guess @RealBrookeAdams is just gonna have to feel it, like @hemmepowered and @MeanQueenK already have. #Dollhouse @TheTarynTerrell
I'm a fan of #FourthGunn. But they're villains. So I react to them as such. @JohnnyGargano @TARIKhatesyou @DrewGulak @_StarDESTROYER
3/1 OZ Academy: Chikayo Nagashima vs. Hikaru Shida. 
Just watched Chikayo Nagashima vs. Hikaru Shida from the 3/1 OZ Academy event. A thoroughly entertaining pro wrestling match. Recommended.
@KarleeDaniels @Kay_Lee_Ray @SHIMMERwomen You are lucky. Kay Lee is so talented. :)
@TysonDux and @TARIKhatesyou had a great match @smashwrestling on Sunday as well. This was one physical and brutal encounter. #TheArtofWar
@gregoryiron Good match with @_banks on Sunday @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar. It's always a treat to see the two of you wrestle live. :)
Thank you and goodnight, Verne Gagne. A legend gone but never forgotten. #RIPVerneGagne
@badboicasey I have no idea. Sorry.
@SouthsideWE announced that #TNAKnockout @gailkimITSME will wrestle #BritishBootCamp2's @Kay_Lee_Ray on July 18. 
Give the women of wrestling a chance on June 6 @smashwrestling. 
@TheTarynTerrell @RealBrookeAdams Someone's butt is about to get a whoopin'. :)
@Devil_in_mn He's fine now. :)
@RobKovach999 My ticket is bought. :)
The #Dollhouse now have profiles on the official #TNAKnockouts website! @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA 
@RobKovach999 My hometown.
@MeaganG1990 Probably call those too. Lelt's wait and see?
@MeaganG1990 That's a wise decision.
@MeaganG1990 Is the game set for Camden Yards?
If only we cross out words in hashtags! Looking forward to this event. 
@smashwrestling @CandiceLeRae @_banks Kick his ass, Candice. :) #GOLD2k15
@ActualALove @RichardsWesley Congratulations! This is awesome news. Wishing you both all the best in the world. :) 
@JamesKeeSmash Take it easy. That was a helluva superkick. Gargano shall pay next month.
@Lex2018 I'd be envious if you're able to watch Dragonmania on TV. CMLL aired weekly here on TLN years ago! All the best to Team #Stardom.
One of the best things about @smashwrestling is how much fun everyone seems to have, from fans to the wrestlers.
@HeidiLovelace wrestling dudes? Wish I could see it. :)
@badboicasey That's not cool. -_-
Koguma is advertised on the official poster. But she is still a high school student.
@DazzledbyDivas @NaomiWWE Those shades though. :)
Kairi Hojo, Mayu Iwatani and Io Shirai bound for Dragonmania 2015 on May 23 in Mexico. Mima Shimoda will be teaming with them. #Stardom
@badboicasey This made me laugh. :)
@SteveAmiri @lostmikeys You oughta know.
@lostmikeys Meh. Let's see how things go.
@JamesKeeSmash Nice chair shot on Tarik though. :)
@IMPACTWRESTLING As opposed to being one of pro wrestling most creative minds.
Billy Corgan joined TNA? WTF?

Smash Wrestling "The Art of War" Results (4/26/15)

Read: 
@lenayada What a beauty. :)
@mauroranallo Congratulations! Great news.
@divadirt @LeahVonDutch Beautiful and dangerous so she is. :)
Kinda cool seeing @greedwrestling and @Walking_Weapon as a team yesterday given the history of the Overdogs. @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar
@AgatioGanon Yeah, four favourites. Samoa Joe, too, for a while. :)
@shirai_io Very colourful nails. :)
@CandiceLeRae Nice gear. Great match. :)
@BookItGabe It was a great match. Definitely recommended.
@TheWolvesNation The Wolves vs. Drew Gulak and Biff Busick was a fantastic tag-team wrestling match at Smash on Sunday. #WolvesNation
@TheTarynTerrell defends the Knockouts Title against challenger @RealBrookeAdams on #HardcoreJustice. Will the #Dollhouse be victorious? :)
TNA aired One Night Only: Hardcore Justice on PPV and now this week's Impact Wrestling is titled Hardcore Justice. Not the same of course.
@Lagana @DestAmerica Should be another exciting night of professional wrestling. #HardcoreJustice

#HardcoreJustice 9/8c on @DestAmerica 
Wow. @SamoaJoe is coming to @smashwrestling on June 6. O.O
It's a shame #FourthGunn attacked @TylerTWrestling, @suavewrestling and @HackerScotty tonight. Karma is a bitch, gentlemen! @smashwrestling
@JohnnyGargano defeated @MDoggMattCross to officially become @smashwrestling champion tonight. #FourthGunn reigns supreme! #TheArtofWar
@DaveMuscarella Candice won a very entertaining match.
This @WWERomanReigns fella seems to be having some great matches. #ExtremeRules
@CandiceLeRae and Courtney Rush had themselves a helluva match tonight @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar. Thank you! :)
@RobbieEImpact @RichardsWesley @TheEddieEdwards Thank you for kicking ass @smashwrestling, gentlemen. Hope to see you again someday. :)
@ActualALove I spied a Knockout @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar. A wolf doesn't stray far from the pack. ;-) @TheEddieEdwards @RichardsWesley
FACT: @RichardsWesley and @TheEddieEdwards vs. @DrewGulak and @_StarDESTROYER was an awesome tag-team match @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar.
@gailkimITSME What is your favourite Korean dish, Gail? :)
@smashwrestling Cross vs. Gargano, LeRae vs. Rush, Wolves vs. Fourth Gunn... oh I'm looking forward to the entire card. #TheArtofWar
@_StarDESTROYER @smashwrestling I am looking forward to this match. Always a good time to be had at Smash. :)
Come see @gailkimITSME and @MRayneTNA in action! :) 
The Wolves and Robbie E. @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar on Sunday!
Happy Birthday @MegaMeguCat. Hope your special day is an awesome one. The best in the world more than deserves it. :)

Hey, @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar is set for tomorrow. Who doesn't love real pro wrestling?! :)
@AgatioGanon #NightofMadison :-)
@AgatioGanon Something about them, isn't there?
@AgatioGanon That's cruel and unusual punishment. I'm in favour.
@Lucha_GaryICW @pepperparks @cherrrybomb @TNADixie @JohnGaburick Sign 'em both. It's the only true way to go.

 #TNAKnockouts #DestinationIMPACT
@ActualALove Do we really say aboot and eh? :)
@AXEtheMercenary @MeanQueenK HA! I seem to recall Kharma being given similar videos featuring her taking the head off dolls!
@AXEtheMercenary The Wikipedia listing has been driving me bananas!
You can bet @MeanQueenK isn't too happy about the #Dollhouse putting her through a table! #TKO #NightofKnockouts
Has @TheEricYoung stepped too far over the line with his attack on @AustinAries and World Champion @RealKurtAngle? #DestinationIMPACT
@AXEtheMercenary Factual accuracy has never been that company's strong point.
Josh Matthews said that @TheTarynTerrell has held the Knockouts Title for 184 days as of last night. @gailkimITSME record length is 210.
@gailkimITSME Eat Defeat is far more appetizing! :)
@TheTarynTerrell Let's see #Dollhouse put a jawbreaker inside the mouth of @gailkimITSME. :)
@TheTarynTerrell Of course... but with one eye open! @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA #Dollhouse
This simply must happen! :) @gailkimITSME @cherrrybomb #CherryBomb4TNA  
@smashwrestling What exactly is a Fourth Gunn anyway? We keep asking these questions yet we receive no answers! #TheArtofWar
Oh snap! :o 
@CatherineNikita @JadeTNA @RebelTNA Things are getting very interesting.
@JadeTNA @MadKing_ston81 You're perfectly normal. Everyone else is crazy. :o
#FF @BDCBeatDownClan because you won't like what happens if you don't. #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME The Knockouts aren't here to play games, especially not after what transpired on Impact. #TeamGail
@JadeTNA @gailkimITSME The Dollhouse is going all BDC on us! O.O
@pepperparks @cherrrybomb @IMPACTWRESTLING @DestAmerica It's just too sweet.
Jade and Marti coming in with kendo sticks like they're Shida Hikaru.
#PetPeeve Typos! -_-
@JGWP @Lex2018 You're damn right.
@MartiBellTNA @JadeTNA @TheTarynTerrell Every house has its own set of rules. #Dollhouse #NightOfKnockouts
This is a hostile takeover of the Knockouts division! @TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA #Dollhouse
Oh my! @TheTarynTerrell @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA were plotting and scheming all this time. The #Dollhouse is a force to be reckoned with.
@JGWP Price gouging. Thievery.
@GKeatdefeat @MartiBellTNA @MickieJames Mickie's going to DDT Marti's backside? That's rude.
@JGWP We have a French station that gives us some amazing global cinema but rarely with English subtitles.
Can't wait to see what happens in this big match! @TheTarynTerrell #NightOfKnockouts  
@JGWP Impact airs on the Fight Network here in Canada.
@gailkimITSME @hemmepowered I see what you did there.
@gailkimITSME @cherrrybomb @IMPACTWRESTLING Cherry's got my vote! She's awesome. #CherryBomb4TNA Are you listening @TNADixie?
@MeaganG1990 Hahahaha! Good.
@MeaganG1990 I see your Yankees are dragging tonight.
@JGWP Good thing we have the Internet. :)
@lenayada @CatherineNikita @gailkimITSME Only to the blind. lol
@JGWP Oh, it's always 100% real. Forever and always. :)
@CatherineNikita @lenayada "Sisters" tag-team with @gailkimITSME. Hahaha! Because stupid people think all Asians look the same.
@MartiBellTNA @MickieJames That would be a membership in a very exclusive club... er faction! :)
@CatherineNikita We Want @lenayada? :)
@cherrrybomb @Kimber_Lee90 @XandraBale @smashwrestling Didn't these two teams recently do battle at @SHIMMERwomen too?!
You should see @cherrrybomb and @Kimber_Lee90 vs. Courtney Rush and @XandraBale from @smashwrestling CANUSA Classic 2014. Excellent match!
I love it when people think storylines are real.
Bet @cherrrybomb could have used an assist from her partner-in-crime @Kimber_Lee90 in that match with the #Dollhouse. #NightofKnockouts #TKO
Edit your handle a dozen times... but your tweeting style remains the same!
 #DestinationIMPACT
@MartiBellTNA Doesn't this ref realize that the #Dollhouse is nothing to mess with?! :o
@TheTarynTerrell Hmm. You seem mighty impressed, champ! ;) #NightOfKnockouts

@AXSTV_PR Thanks a lot. I look forward to May 22. :)
When does NJPW return to AXS-TV? I miss watching matches with English commentary. #NJPWonAXS
@dedysilveria MayuMania is running wild...
The #Dollhouse of @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA debuts tonight. What does this mean for the Knockouts division? #TKO #NightofKnockouts
@gailkimITSME @DestAmerica Looking forward to this tonight. Exciting stuff, including the Angle vs. Eric title bout as well. :)
@MarkIrby1 Happy Friday. May you have a great day and an even better weekend.

@gailkimITSME Friday is here! Let the countdown begin... #TKO #NightofKnockouts
New account. Same old song and dance.
It's @CandiceLeRae vs. Courtney Rush this Sunday in Toronto @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar. Should be lots of fun this weekend.
@lenayada You're perfect, Lena. :)
@Lucha_GaryICW You know what would be awesome? @cherrrybomb vs. @gailkimITSME, but we must wait for #KnockoutsKnockdown3 to see that one! :)
@Lucha_GaryICW @cherrrybomb I understand it's the best ever.
Exclusive: Who Is Laura Dennis (@cherrrybomb)? Find Out before TKO Night of Knockouts ... 
@CatherineNikita Oops. I messed up and forgot to tag Gail in my reply. :(
@CatherineNikita @GKInteractive @lenayada The announcers would be confused, like Jesse Ventura mixing up the Jumping Bomb Angels. :)
Mayu Iwatani seems to enjoy wrapping herself in blue streamers as they're thrown into the ring!
@aberdango69 Click this link and scroll to the area discussing television and time zones! 
@MeaganG1990 I think it's time to beat the piss out of the Mets.
Might be a good time to re-watch @Kay_Lee_Ray vs @gailkimITSME from #BritishBootCamp2 
Friday 9/8c @DestAmerica 
Taryn vs Kong! 
Mickie announcement!
4-way KO match and more! 
@JersyMikeJr Yes, Kong can be found @MeanQueenK.
An exciting match is set for Saturday, July 18 @SouthsideWE! It is @gailkimITSME vs. @Kay_Lee_Ray. 
@SouthsideWE @gailkimITSME @Kay_Lee_Ray This is a must-see match. Wishing all the best to both ladies.
@SCsirens @MartiBellTNA @JadeTNA Absolutely! It's going to be awesome. #Dollhouse
@MeaganG1990 Let's keep our fingers crossed. They've already done a shoot for next year's calendar.
@MeaganG1990 Thanks a lot. Very nice pics. Now bring on the #Dollhouse debut this Friday night.
The #Dollhouse coming soon to the #TNAKnockouts website! @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA

@gailkimITSME Were the Knockouts having a photo shoot, Gail? 
@gailkimITSME That worked out nicely.
#Stardom will hold its Cinderella tournament on 4/23 with 14 wrestlers competing. Io Shirai and Koguma have a first round bye. Good luck.
@RobertIrvine Good morning! Wishing you all the best on this Wednesday.

@gailkimITSME Even milk?
@MarkIrby1 Your artwork is quality, my friend.

@HellcatPerez @mraynenetwork @MRayneTNA Should be an exciting match. :)

@andre_corbeil @DestAmerica @IMPACTWRESTLING @cherrrybomb @gailkimITSME @ActualALove #Cherry4TNA? I agree 100% with this statement.

#TheArtofWar takes place April 26 and I'm not referring to a reading of Sun Tzu's ancient treatise. It's another epic @smashwrestling event.

@maemymomor Love that pic of @gailkimITSME and @TheaTrinidadTMT. Wish we could have seen 'em feud. Awesome ladies. :)
@VampNikki This event is going to be epic!
Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the tip of a leaf. - Tagore

#DestinationIMPACT 

@dedysilveria Nice work. Is there any word on when Nanae might return?
@CatherineNikita You're awesome though. :)
@1HardcoreMJFan @SeleziyaSparx She kicks the asses of both men and women!
@dedysilveria The recent Hojo vs. Kimura match from the World Title tournament was so good. I'm curious to see how Chelsea does in the ring.
The #Dollhouse debuts this Friday on @IMPACTWRESTLING. I am looking forward to seeing what @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA are all about. :)
@JadeTNA That face on the poster has me creeped out.
@BleacherReport @stevenamoney Yet here I am content winning a free play on my lottery tickets. -_-
The stroke of midnight bring us one day closer to @TheTarynTerrell vs. @MeanQueenK for the Knockouts Title. #DestinationIMPACT
Such trickery hasn't gone unnoticed.
@dedysilveria Wolf vs. Shirai, please. :)
@dedysilveria I see Koguma faces the winner of Hazuki vs. Watanabe. I had forgotten about that.
@dedysilveria I wonder it they will wrestle each other in the Cinderella tournament.
@CatherineNikita Yeah, some people act awfully bad here on Twitter. It's like they think it grants them license to treat others badly.
Koguma pins Hazuki to win a tag-team match, followed by Hazuki eliminating Koguma to win a battle royale at Stardom. Two young rising stars.
The 4/19 Pro Wrestling WAVE card is intriguing with Shirai/Ohata defending against Fujimoto/Kobayashi, plus Ayako vs. Meiko for the belt. :)
@CatherineNikita What must one do to be blocked by Maryse?
@1HardcoreMJFan @SeleziyaSparx Nice shades! She rules. :)
@CatherineNikita That's not cool.
@the_catpower Jump for joy. :)
@CatherineNikita Who unfollowed you? You're the best. :(
@AXEtheMercenary It was one year ago... 
Edit your Twitter handle a dozen times... but your tweeting style remains the same!
@RonHutchison1 @gailkimITSME Gail has come such a long way. Congrats again on your special award. :)
@TNAWWEGuy I must tune-in for this tomorrow night. #WatchROH
@TNAWWEGuy Who's in the main event? I missed last week's TV. :(
@RoxxiNikki Happy Birthday! Hope your special day is a super awesome one. You deserve it. Miss seeing you kicking ass. :)
Those video packages indicate @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA might not be playing with a full deck. :-) #Dollhouse
@UltraLiger @BaneofWrestling Tough night at the office.
That graphic states "they are taking over." Indeed *they* are. #TKO #NightofKnockouts #DestinationIMPACT
@GKeatdefeat @gailkimITSME So looking forward to #TKO #NightofKnockouts.
@MeaganG1990 What was said?
@gailkimITSME @REALLiSAMARiE Awesome pic! You all look fantastic. :)
@Lex2018 @cherrrybomb @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA Yim and Cherry going at it? Must-see TV. :)
@VampNikki Perhaps it was due to a troll asking wrestlers to block me. To this day he still exhibits such behaviour. Pathetic, really.
@VampNikki Your guess is as good as mine. Even my personal account. o.O
@VampNikki Velvet blocked me a long time ago. lol
@VampNikki Angelina blocked you? Why?
@gailkimITSME with a "Shut. The. Hell. Up." to @ActualALove. Take that record-breaking 6-time Knockouts Champion! #DestinationIMPACT #TKO
Did I see @hemmepowered swipe the mic from Queen Bee @MRayneTNA? She wasn't done addressing her people. #DestinationIMPACT #NightofKnockouts
Impact Wrestling 04/17/15 Knockouts Segment 
New Knockouts! @cherrrybomb vs. @JadeTNA, with @MartiBellTNA, is on the card. Excited about this match. #Dollhouse 
@CRegal23 @TNAMecca Great site for TNA fans! :)
Kairi Hojo in a Bullet Club t-shirt and Io Shirai wearing one of TMDK. Wrestlers are fans too. :)
@gailkimITSME vs. @ActualALove vs. @MRayneTNA vs. @RealBrookeAdams to determine a new #1 contender! Who wins? 
@cherrrybomb next Friday? @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA too? You're killing me with all of this. 
Current reigning Knockouts Champion @TheTarynTerrell will defend her gold against @MeanQueenK next Friday on #TKO. 
@therealglennm @IMPACTWRESTLING currently airs in Canada on @fightnet.
@Bloodreign75 Give the women of wrestling a chance! :)
@thunderrosa22 @stardomchelsea @peqeStarfire Wishing you all the best in the upcoming Cinderella tournament. #Stardom :)
@Lex2018 Taryn vs. Kong for the Knockouts Title is the main event next Friday.
@Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah Yes, it would be great to attend Ice Ribbon, as well. Hope your plans work out.
@JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA "The Dollhouse is coming, and they're f'ing nuts!" says PWInsider's Impact write-up. :-)
@OfficialTAZ People tweet too much and know too little.
@AgatioGanon Madison to kick and take names next week in the #1 contender match. :)
@TheEricYoung @PredsNHL Cup Finals this year, Eric?
@shupercousin This artwork could make a nice t-shirt. :)
@SeleziyaSparx Kick his ass! :)
@wolfinjapan Above the clouds on top of the world. A wolf reaching higher heights.
World Heavyweight Champion @RealKurtAngle vs. that psycho challenger @TheEricYoung should be a great match! #DestinationIMPACT
@WidowsPEAKED This one is even better. lol
@WidowsPEAKED Their expressions though.
@RealBrookeAdams Have an awesome time this weekend. :)
@AgatioGanon We get Divas in a "reality" setting instead.
@CatherineNikita Dolls trampled under heels? HA!
@MATTHARDYBRAND @JEFFHARDYBRAND Congratulations on winning the TNA World Tag-Team Titles for the first time. My prediction came true.
@shupercousin @HAVOKTNA @wrestlingleva Fantastic work as always. :)
@gailkimITSME The fans are the real winners when these two collide. I'm still rooting for our fellow Canadian though. Psycho as he is.
@kimurarock @HeidiLovelace #OedoTai forever! :)
TKO Night of Knockouts happens next week on Destination America 
@JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA The Doll House... Coming Next Week to TKO (Apr. 17, 2015) 
@CatherineNikita I haven't watched yet. Shall do so soon. :o
@CatherineNikita Jade and Marti coming soon! :o
@CatherineNikita Caps lock mode? Hahahahaha! :)
@JGWP I see what you did there, John. Hope all is well.
@CatherineNikita Next week is going to be an eye opener for fans! That is for sure.
@seansheep6 Really? Looking forward to this.
A Knockouts Impact next week that includes Angle vs. Eric for the belt? Why must TNA make this all so confusing? Oh right...
@AllHailGailKim I picked Hardys to win, but I'd love to see Dirty Heels victorious too.
@ActualALove @gailkimITSME Uh oh. Angelina's about to bare her claws! O.O
@gailkimITSME A Knockouts Ultimate X match. Book it. lol
@numero0047 @TNADARKKNIGHT Excellent! :)
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 I must get my health card and passport sorted out first.
@CSUKTown It's going to be BADASS!!
@TNADARKKNIGHT Another video package?
I dream of visiting Japan to see REINA, JWP, Stardom, New Japan and Dragon Gate live in person. @Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah #wishfulthinking
@metalpeter @UltraLiger @gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING That time Gail Kim tweeted Nancy Grace to tell her she'd like to kick her ass!
I'm happy to see @JewellsMalone return to @smashwrestling for the #GiveDivasAChance event on June 6. The #HardcorePrincess shall dominate.
@IMPACTWRESTLING I'm predicting a Hardys victory! #UltimateX #TagTeamGold #DestinationIMPACT
Everyone should watch Alexander Mackendrick's classic, Sweet Smell of Success. Essential Hollywood cinema. #cookiefullofarsenic
@gailkimITSME Your thoughts on #NightofKnockouts, the #1 contender 4-way and Kong vs. Taryn, Gail? So excited for next week. #TNAKnockouts
@REALBobbyRoode and @AustinAries reuniting as Dirty Heels for the #TagTeamGold tournament is great. Love this team. #DestinationIMPACT
@JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA Absolutely! Not long now, right? #TNAKnockouts
@WidowsPEAKED He is calling the action or arguing with himself?
@Lex2018 @JadeTNA Yes, Mia Yim and Marti Belle. I'm well excited to see them debut.
@TNADixie Love the Kong vs. Taryn poster! #DestinationIMPACT #NightofKnockouts
@MartiBellTNA @JadeTNA This is one #Dollhouse I cannot wait to see. #DestinationIMPACT #NightofKnockouts
@Lex2018 Exciting news! Should be a badass night.
Awesome idea! Thank you @TNADixie @hemmepowered @IMPACTWRESTLING. Can't wait to tune-in for the #NightofKnockouts 
@HaniaHuntress That Rhino looks mighty sad. Understandably so. :(
There will be a KOs edition of @IMPACTWRESTLING next Friday. Will this special feature the debut of @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA? #Dollhouse
I do wish @RebelTNA were in the ring with her fellow #TNAKnockouts! @HAVOKTNA as well.
@The305MVP @RealKurtAngle The #BDC's time is now! #DestinationIMPACT
@AgatioGanon Two entirely different championships from two entirely different companies.
@MRayneTNA Can't wait to find out what the announcement will be. #TNAKnockouts #DestinationIMPACT

@CatherineNikita Bring on the Knockouts!
Clowns referring to the Knockouts Title as the Divas Title. -_-
@gailkimITSME @EthanCarterTNA has all the ingredients to make a great world champion! #TheFuture #DestinationIMPACT
@RockstarSpud How do you feel about The Rising?
@MickieJames A surefire Hall of Famer! :)
@mb168 @gailkimITSME Sriracha and Pineapple? I must try this some way somehow. lol
@ilyassking1 Quality work! :) #TNAKnockouts
@DestAmerica @MATTHARDYBRAND @JEFFHARDYBRAND The legendary duo might well win it all. #DestinationIMPACT #TagTeamGold
@gailkimITSME @DestAmerica So curious to find out what this major announcement will be and how it will *impact* the Knockouts Division! :)
@CatherineNikita It's okay. Hope video appears online soon. :)
@TNADixie It's time! It's time! It's #DestinationIMPACT time on @DestAmerica in USA and @fightnet in Canada. Let's do this @IMPACTWRESTLING.
@CatherineNikita Three and a quarter stars.
@gailkimITSME Absolutely! Bring it on. :)
@smashwrestling Just received the latest email newsletter. Three interesting additions to the June 6 #GiveDivasAChance event. :)
A fan gave the Havok vs. Gail street fight a ***1/4 rating. Fetch the video for me. Fetch.
@LluviaQueen Beautiful pic. :)
@HAVOKTNA Time to take it out on some unsuspecting Knockouts. :-)
@lenayada You look amazing! Congrats and all the best with your new project.
@DaysGreen1 @AgatioGanon @MRayneTNA This is an amazing shot of Madison! :)

#StandUP 

Please RT 
@TNADixie @MartiBellTNA @JadeTNA Yes, I cannot wait for their official debut. The #Dollhouse is certainly most intriguing. #TNAKnockouts

@DestAmerica 
#StandUP 
@IMPACTWRESTLING 
Soon we will find out what the major KOs announcement will be on @IMPACTWRESTLING. Can't wait to find out. @hemmepowered #TNAKnockouts
Just saw @RealKevinNash in The Longest Yard.
@VickieGuerrero Happy Birthday! Hope you're having an awesome special day. :)
@gailkimITSME Yes, the pic. :)
@gailkimITSME Is the pic on your award of you with both Knockouts belts? :)
@wolfinjapan Show the newcomer that this Wolf is not to be messed with. All the best in the tournament. :)
@MarkIrby1 Nice work, Mark. :)
@cherrrybomb Happy birthday! :)
@numero0047 All the best to your cats this morning.
Happy Birthday @JadeTNA. Hope your special day is a super awesome one. You deserve it.
Who's excited about the major Knockouts-related announcement this Friday night on @IMPACTWRESTLING? What is this about? #DestinationIMPACT
@wolfinjapan Just watched the #Stardom press conference video on YouTube. Are you going to take a bite out of Chelsea in the tournament? :)
@wolfinjapan @RosaThunder Have fun, ladies! Nice hat. :)
@kairi_hojo to win the Cinderella tournament. #Stardom
@RonHutchison1 @gailkimITSME @TheBethPhoenix @SiNNbODHi Congratulations all around. Respect is due. :) #CAC2015
@gailkimITSME @TheBethPhoenix @REALLiSAMARiE Congratulations one and all. A trio of awesome butt-kicking wrestlers. :)
@gailkimITSME Congratulations, Gail. @CACReunion women's wrestling award recipient. Your fans are very proud of you. :)
#SexyLady
#CAC2015 
#LASVEGAS 
I wonder if WWE fans might see @OfficialTAZ at the broadcast table again at some point?
@CatherineNikita Hoping video is posted online. :)
Last night's #AgentsofSHIELD #Melinda episode though! O.O
@RebelTNA We Want Rebel. :)
@CatherineNikita @HAVOKTNA @gailkimITSME This match sounds insane! Wish I could see it. Respect to both wrestlers.
@gailkimITSME Do you know one of the city settings for #AvengersAgeOfUltron is Seoul, South Korea? True story! :) #Marvel @Marvel
@RebelTNA What will the announcement be? A reminder that it's foolish not to #StandUp4Rebel? :)
@gailkimITSME @TheTraciBrooks @JackieMooreTx Settle this in the ring, ladies! Haha :)
A major Knockouts-related announcement? Can't wait to find out what it will be. #DestinationIMPACT #TNAKnockouts  
@gailkimITSME @OfficialTAZ Wait. Taz has left TNA? This is a shocker! Wishing you all the best in the world to an ECW legend. Thank you!
@gailkimITSME Love that shot of you about to dive off the top of the cage! :)
@AlexxiaaNicole Happy Birthday! Hope your special day is an awesome one. :)
@FollowMe_Seth @cherrrybomb is perfect! :)
@BethBrittHardy_ Yikes! Hope everyone is okay. :(
Coming Soon:  @JadeTNA &amp; @MartiBellTNA #DestinationIMPACT: 
@gailkimITSME Congratulations @REALLiSAMARiE! So deserving. :)
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 Love this group pic. :)
@gailkimITSME All the best tomorrow, Gail. :)
@Lex2018 Takumi and Nanae will not compete in the Cinderella tournament. :(
@dedysilveria I see Io and Koguma have a first round bye?
@Lex2018 Glad you had an awesome time at SHIMMER. Please take care and get well soon.
@Aaron_S_GFX Let me get this straight. Kimura could boot her opponent in the face and toss her over the top and that would be it? #confused
@gailkimITSME Glad you're okay. :)
@gailkimITSME Blood tests? Allergies? Hope you're okay, Gail. :)
Tomoka Nakagawa and Toshie Uematsu replied me on FaceBook today! :)
@TNADixie Bring back the Knockouts tag-team titles! @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA #Dollhouse

8 teams battle to qualify for an Ultimate X Match to become the NEW World Tag... 
@smashwrestling Good thing I'm subscribed to the email newsletter. All Smash fans should be. :)
@FoodNetwork Give me some right now. :)
@BaneofWrestling Takumi's out 8 months due to injury. Nanae's not back yet either.
#Stardom has the worst luck. :(
The trios tag-team belts held by Io Shirai, Mayu Iwatani and Takumi Iroha have been vacated. Iroha is out 8 months due to injury. #Stardom
@AXEtheMercenary There is truth in these words.
@Aaron_S_GFX This will be a 14-woman tournament. Takumi Iroha and Nanae Takahashi sidelined with injuries.
@IMPACTWRESTLING I'm excited to see @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA debut. Bring on #Dollhouse. #DestinationIMPACT
@blue02sky19 Starfire Mayu? :)
@CatherineNikita So many people need to remember this.
@AXEtheMercenary It's time for Naomi to reign as champion!
@NaomiWWE Naomi is taking over, bitches! :)
@gailkimITSME Finally caught up on this past week's #FreshOffTheBoat. Best sitcom on television right now. Beware of that certain number. :)
@gailkimITSME Super pleasant travels tomorrow. :)
Courtney Rush has some words for @CandiceLeRae ahead of @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar on April 26: 
@CACReunion Have an awesome time tonight @gailkimITSME. Proud of you. :)
@KarleeLeilani You are so perfect. :)
@JadeFansiteCom Awesome idea! :)
@BulletClubNJPW It's just too damn sweet! #BulletClub
@RobertIrvine All is well. Thank you.
@RobertIrvine Pleasant travels and good morning!
#ArigatoTomoka #ThankYouTomoka May the rest of your life be blessed with happiness and fullfilment. Continue realizing all of your dreams.
@GoddessOfCats @SHIMMERwomen Awesome pic! #ThankYouTomoka
@HeidiLovelace @Evie_NZ #TeamSlapHappy shall reign supreme soon enough.
@JGWP You're a funny guy, John.
@SHIMMERwomen Kimber Bombs wrestled Courtney and Xandra? How I loved their match at @smashwrestling last year. Congrats to the new champs!
Sheep will believe anything they read.
Whenever I see a Spider suplex, I'm reminded of how much I miss Azumi Hyuga.
@JeremyBorash @gailkimITSME @chefbeaumac Nice pic. Looking good, Gail. :)
Scratch that. All I see is Nascar ****ery instead. -_-
Ring of Honor on my television screen! #WatchROH
@ShimmerDownMeow @smashwrestling Ah yes! That match was tremendous indeed. I should have known. lol
@JadeTNA @kimurarock Two awesome pro wrestlers! Congratulations to both of you. :)
@ShimmerDownMeow @smashwrestling Which match from CANUSA?
@gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK *Gail pins Kong after Eat Defeat*
Crowd: "That was three!"
Taz: "No, it wasn't."
#KongVsGail #DestinationIMPACT
@Dina7810 #GoDinaGo :)
This was great. More of this now they're both on IMPACT! @JadeTNA @gailkimITSME  
@ProWresLand @WeeklyWPodcast @JadeTNA Suplex City, Bitch! :)
@iDavidAlexander Shading Spike TV? Yes...
@DAFALCON11 This has instant classic written all over it.
@TheaTrinidadTMT @RealMelina This pic is perfection, ladies. :)
@DAFALCON11 Remember when Gail served as referee for once Mia's matches? Little did we know what the future would hold.
I love that @IMPACTWRESTLING now airs on @fightnet here in Canada. Better than that other network. @DestAmerica in USA is great too.
@DAFALCON11 @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA @IMPACTWRESTLING It's an interesting development. Willing to see where it goes.
@CatherineNikita Did Mickie James appear last night?
@DAFALCON11 @JadeTNA @MartiBellTNA @IMPACTWRESTLING I have one... but it's a spoiler that hasn't aired yet. :o
@CatherineNikita I look forward to reading this week's entry.
@DAFALCON11 @JadeTNA @gailkimITSME HA! Korea shall reign supreme on that day. :)
@ShimmerDownMeow Someone's going to feel it.
Thoughts on #TheDollhouse? What would you like to see happen with @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA once they've made their @IMPACTWRESTLING debut?
@LordRollins @WidowsPEAKED I love it when fake MMA fighters bash pro wrestling.
Fourth Gunn Speaks! @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar: 
@gailkimITSME with a running dropkick to @MeanQueenK on the floor? That looked cool. #DestinationIMPACT #KongVsGail
Impact Wrestling 4/10/15 @MeanQueenK vs. @gailkimITSME: 
@gailkimITSME vs. @JadeTNA is a dream match in the making.
@gailkimITSME @FreshOffABC YES! #FreshOffTheBoat is awesome! I haven't yet seen this week's episode however. Love it.
The Final NJPW Star signed for ROH War of the Worlds &amp; Global Wars is....: 
@ShimmerDownMeow @smashwrestling What is a Fourth Gunn anyway?
@MeaganG1990 But not really. :)
@MeaganG1990 I demand this game go 38 innings!
Give DASH Chisako and Sendai Sachiko championship gold. Best tag-team. :)  @dashchisako @sendaisach1ko
@DAFALCON11 Same here. To send her best wishes on her retirement.
@TNAWWEGuy This is crazy.
#ThankYouTomoka @SHIMMERwomen
All the best to the awesome wrestlers of @SHIMMERwomen this weekend in Chicago! Tear it up, ladies!
@JadeTNA Spring... it's just another word for Winter.
Gail Kim defeated Havok in a Street Fight at One Night Only: Hardcore Justice.
Hinting at a return to television? #DestinationIMPACT  
What is this #Dollhouse all about? What are true intentions of @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA? We will find out soon enough. #DestinationIMPACT
Remember when @gailkimITSME appeared on BrainSurge and her name was edited to read Gayle King?!
@MeaganG1990 The game is still going on?! O.O
A certain website states Jade Chung is coming to TNA. It's Mia Yim actually. Must be the name Jade or because they're both Asian. :-)
@MeaganG1990 Blasted BoSox. Boooo!
@MeaganG1990 Your Yankees are only 3-3 in 11 though. -_-
@MeaganG1990 My Jays win 12-5 though. :-)
@DAFALCON11 @JadeTNA It's bound to happen!
@JRsBBQ @IMPACTWRESTLING @MeanQueenK @gailkimITSME Well said, Mr. Ross. #Dollhouse is coming too! #DestinationIMPACT
@CatherineNikita @gailkimITSME @JadeTNA Super exciting news! :) #Dollhouse #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME Heard your match with @MeanQueenK tonight is a great one. I can't wait to see it. #DestinationIMPACT #TNAKnockouts #GailVsKong
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING Curious development. Let's see what @JadeTNA and @MartiBellTNA are all about. #Dollhouse #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME @TheEricYoung is psychotic! That man has completely gone off the deep end. #DestinationIMPACT
Coming Soon:  Jade (@JadeTNA) &amp; Marti Bell (@MartiBellTNA) (Apr. 10, 2015) #Dollhouse #DestinationIMPACT: 
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING @DestAmerica It's going to be a great night of Impact Wrestling. #KongvsGail #TNAKnockouts
@RockstarSpud @MeanQueenK Once you go black... :-)

@RockstarSpud &amp; @MeanQueenK <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️

#ImWithSpud #UnderDog #SexMachine 
@jwppro Two awesome champions! Two great wrestlers!
I love how some think Gail vs. Kong is a feud continued, but I noticed Kim chose her words carefully in that exclusive YouTube video. :)
@gailkimITSME @DestAmerica @MeanQueenK Can't wait to watch and live tweet as well. You can do this Gail.
@SenorLARIATO There's a Crush Gals tag from '87 wherein the schoolgirls in the crowd have pom poms. No joke.
Will Shinsuke Nakamura be part of the upcoming ROH/NJPW events?
@billsavelli Because Gail and Toto got whisked away to Oz.
@magicimpact Ask TNA. They should have said "over 5 years." I'm being silly poking fun at this meaningless oversight.
@Gailcopter @TNADixie @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK I'm excited. There's a certain nostalgic feel surrounding this encounter.
@magicimpact Yes. Their last one-on-one match took place on the August 21, 2008 edition of Impact Wrestling.
TNA believes 2008 through 2015 equals 5 years! #confused
@IMPACTWRESTLING @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK This will be their first singles match in just under 7 years.
@Chrissyy2k14 Go for it. lol
@Chrissyy2k14 Foxy is awesome! :)
@mraynenetwork @MRayneTNA The Queen with her crown! :)
And here is video of that particular Street Fight eons ago! @gailkimITSME 
I see @gailkimITSME referenced her 8/21/08 Street Fight with Kong in commenting on their match for #1 contendership. #DestinationIMPACT
@MeaganG1990 Anything is possible. :)
Exclusive: @gailkimITSME on facing @MeanQueenK this Friday and their past feud: 
@DestAmerica @IMPACTWRESTLING @gailkimITSME The fans are the real winners when these two square off in the ring. :)
A tournament will be held to determine World of #Stardom Champion Kairi Hojo's first challenger. 16(?) wrestlers to compete.
@gailkimITSME @PureBarrePhilly No pain, no gain? :)
@gailkimITSME @PureBarrePhilly How was the class today, Gail? :)
Live tweet episode of @IMPACTWRESTLING this Friday, April 10: 
@itsvedatime This pic should be in a frame!
@ringofhonor Is it possible to obtain Global Wars tickets at Ted Reeve Arena in Toronto ahead of next month's big events? #curious
@SexyStarAAA These look so delicious! :)
@mauroranallo Essential viewing for fans of real pro wrestling! #NJPWonAXS
@SHIMMERwomen @badboicasey Kyoko Kimura is everywhere. She's a legend in her own right and an undisputed badass to boot. @kimurarock
@smashwrestling @CandiceLeRae @Kimber_Lee90 This match was a definite highlight last month. Candice and Kimber never fail to kick some ass!
@gailkimITSME Gail, I am going to see The Wolves and Robbie E. wrestle live at Smash this month. It's going to be awesome! :o
I've read both Sun Tzu's The Art of War and Musashi Miyamoto's The Book of Five Rings. Essential literature. What next?
@smashwrestling Nice work on the Cross vs. Gargano video! Looking forward to #TheArtofWar on April 26. I've read Sun Tzu's book. #random
Matt Cross vs. Johnny Gargano for the Smash Wrestling Championship Title #TheArtofWar 
@BEAUTIFULPlCS @mcnabbychic On top of the world.
It's @gailkimITSME vs. @MeanQueenK for #1 contendership this Friday night on @IMPACTWRESTLING. Who is your pick to win? #DestinationIMPACT
@TheaTrinidadTMT Tell us, Thea! :-)
@AgatioGanon This is the truth. :)
@AgatioGanon Brick back Madison for another month. :)
@CatherineNikita Let's wait and see if any details are revealed.
@CatherineNikita Perhaps a "best of" matches or something.
@CatherineNikita ONO event for a DVD? #confused
@badboicasey Here I thought they had already taped the ONO events.
@MRayneTNA Hope you had a good Easter, Madison. Can't wait to see you kicking butt again. :)
@badboicasey You found more info?
@CatherineNikita It's confusing because no explanation was provided. Just a graphic and some hashtags. lol
@CatherineNikita The curious case of the random poster!
That TNA Legends PPV poster is right out of the blue and slightly bewildering to me!
@badboicasey Who is Mickie about to DDT? Tessmacher?
@badboicasey I'm confused.
@AgatioGanon All the time. -_-
@ratetank The world's most badass tag-team?
I'd like to think Kairi Hojo lives on a yacht and uses a motorcycle to commute from place to place. @kairi_hojo @nanaracka #Stardom
Syuri is in Mexico?
I see it's now possible to add comments to a retweet.
@AXEtheMercenary @gailkimITSME Someone should make a comparison clip of Gail and Cena both selling the DDT. lol
@AXEtheMercenary @gailkimITSME Remember this? 
@Lex2018 I'm excited to see them square off in a single match for the first time since August 2008. Have an awesome time at SHIMMER.
A classic rivalry renewed as @gailkimITSME wrestles @MeanQueenK this Friday night on #DestinationIMPACT @DestAmerica. 
@gailkimITSME First one-on-one match since August 2008.
@gailkimITSME You can take Spud, Gail. #NewChamp :)
@HudsonEnvy I hope we get to see you in the Stardom ring again. Wishing you super pleasant travels.
Who has watched One Night Only: Hardcore Justice? How was the @gailkimITSME vs. @HAVOKTNA Street Fight match? Itching to see this one.
@MarkIrby1 @gailkimITSME Love how you've captured Eat Defeat. :)
@BaneofWrestling I'm guessing he was in the zone!
Briscoe vs. Styles main event for this week's ROH television! Lethal vs. Liger next week? #WatchROH
@JGWP Awesome! All the good stuff. -_-
@JGWP April showers bring May flowers...
@CatherineNikita Let's see what happens in the weeks ahead for EC3. :)
@CatherineNikita I agree with you regarding EC3. I'd love to see him dethrone Kurt Angle to become champion at some point.
@CatherineNikita Didn't Storm and Bram have a friendly chat backstage recently? Something is up between these two.
@CatherineNikita Havok returning as a member? That would be a sight to behold.
@CatherineNikita More of this Angelina. I wouldn't mind seeing a re-match with Gail at some point. But curious things are brewing.
@CatherineNikita Mickie to join the Revolution? Would Magnus do the same, or might we see Bram join? Such an interesting storyline.
@CatherineNikita Angelina's promo though... :)
@JGWP We had snow last night, but it's already melted and disappeared. Strange seeing snow on the ground for Easter Sunday.
@CatherineNikita These two Knockouts gave us a good wrestling match. :)
@TWrestlingmag @ActualALove @gailkimITSME Your columnists are dangerous, man! :-)
@SoCalValerie Great pics! :)
@JGWP Happy Easter to you and yours, John. Hope all is well.
@MarkIrby1 @gailkimITSME Excellent work, Mark. As always. :)
@gailkimITSME Happy Easter to you and your family, Gail. Hope you're having a wonderful day.
@gailkimITSME @ActualALove No problem! Thanks for the wrestling match, ladies. :)
@lamissfran @gailkimITSME looks amazing in this attire. :)
Wow. The 4/5 JWP event looks very exciting. So many interesting matches on this card.
@ActualALove At first I thought you hit @gailkimITSME with the microphone still in your hand. :-) #DestinationIMPACT #BellToBell
The Bride wants her revenge on Bill. #LuchaUnderground
It's clear to anyone watching that @fightbobby shoulder wasn't even close to the mat when @RealKurtAngle pinned him to retain. #BellToBell
I wonder if Josh Matthews realizes that by his logic David Arquette was the best wrestler on WCW's roster since he was champion! #BellToBell
@numero0047 HA! Easy now...
@NCWFF Melissa's gonna kill you! :-)
KO Champion @TheTarynTerrell was powerbombed through a table. There's an old saying that goes like this: every action has a reaction!
@MeaganG1990 Got my mojo workin...
@MeaganG1990 10 runs for the Jays and the Yankees lose?
@AXEtheMercenary You don't just dump the baddest bitch like that though.
Impact Wrestling and Lucha Underground to be watched tonight. I love pro wrestling.
@AXEtheMercenary Will he start winning matches now?
@BrittanyTNA showing us all why she's a Future Legend. :)
Angelina: "And I'm so sick and tired of Gail Kim this and Gail Kim that."
Taz: "That might be a shot at me." 
#DestinationIMPACT #BellToBell
@lamissfran New entrance video for @gailkimITSME?!
@BrianStiffler Happy Birthday! Have a good one.
@gailkimITSME Thank you for all the Knockouts do inside (and outside) that 6-sided ring! We love your ass-kicking ways, ladies! :)
Knockouts Match: @ActualALove vs. @gailkimITSME (4/3 Impact Wrestling): 
@gailkimITSME @ActualALove Good wrestling match last night, ladies! The Knockouts showing how it's done in that ring. Rematch? #BellToBell
@Kimber_Lee90 @cherrrybomb Congratulations! My favourite tag-team. Best in the world, ladies. :)
@BrittanyTNA Long may you reign! :)
@MacAtakk This is a fan account. You can find Gail @gailkimITSME. :)
@MacAtakk Finally someone understands. :)
@Lex2018 A Knockouts match too! How predictable.
@CattiesWrestlin @CatherineNikita @BrittanyTNA @MiaYim Congratulations! That is awesome. So proud of you, Santana. :)
@Lex2018 No surprise! TNA commentary has always been rubbish.
@JuanWWETNA Your enthusiasm for pro wrestling is most infectious!
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine Have you seen Kingsman?
@JuanWWETNA As well you should be. Massive respect to the women of SHINE.
@JuanWWETNA These women are just bringing it, aren't they?
@AAWPro @TysonDux Holy ****! That's an impressive card of matches.
@JuanWWETNA You are so lucky being able to watch Shine. I bet it's very exciting.
WWF Women's Title: Bull Nakano (c) vs Kyoko Inoue (AJW 3/26/95): 
Jushin Thunder Liger is coming to ROH/NJPW as well? I simply must attend next month.
@newjapaneng @njpwworld I love this photo so very much!

Watch their epic battles on @njpwworld 

#njpw 
@TNADixie Ranch-o-relax-o? :-)
@GoddessOfCats Get him outta there. lol :-)
No-selling my clever use of spike in that tweet.
@VelVelHoller @BoomerandCarton @Yankees Swinging for the fences!
@Lucha_GaryICW Holy smokes! Wish I could see this epic match.
@Lucha_GaryICW @Kimber_Lee90 Who are Kimber Bombs wrestling tonight?
@TNADixie @Jesse23sports @GallowaySpeaks The action and excitement have certainly experienced a spike since the move to @DestAmerica.
@Barefoot24 @RealKurtAngle @IMPACTWRESTLING @DestAmerica Suplex City?
How many german suplexes will World Champion @RealKurtAngle use in this match? #BellToBell
@ActualALove @JRsBBQ @IMPACTWRESTLING @gailkimITSME These two Knockouts feuding over the championship? Somewhere someday... :)
@hemmepowered ravishing &amp; gr8 presence
@ActualALove @gailkimITSM=$$$
@IMPAC…
@Lucha_GaryICW Sounds crazy! Respect to @wrestlingleva.
Remember when Kumiko Maekawa was knocked off a balcony and fell to the unprotected floor below in a tag match against villain LCO?
@Lucha_GaryICW @wrestlingleva How high is said balcony?
@SoCalValerie @MickieJames @BramTNA @IMPACTWRESTLING @MagnusOfficial Your expressions are priceless, ladies! #BellToBell
@TNANEWScom This storyline is very intriguing so far.
@senorsol72 Love this pic! :)
It's impossible to take the product seriously when its commentary team clearly doesn't.
Competent and coherent commentary is a rarity in professional wrestling.
Perhaps I'll watch Gail vs. Angelina with the audio on mute.
@Barefoot24 Gonna be awesome! I enjoyed their first match.
@gailkimITSME Gail wins! Gail wins! But you can be sure @ActualALove isn't too thrilled about taking the loss! #BellToBell #TNAKnockouts

@gailkimITSME vs @ActualALove don't need a chance. Just a six sided ring. #B…
@KOREANKOCHAMP @gailkimITSME @ActualALove Original Knockouts doing battle tonight. #TNAKnockouts #BellToBell
@EthanCarterTNA @BrodusClay of course!
@IMPACTWRESTLING @ActualALove @gailkimITSME @DestAmerica Let's go Gail! Let's go Gail! #TNAKnockouts #BellToBell
@KOREANKOCHAMP @gailkimITSME @ActualALove Hope all is well, Mickey. :)
@TNANEWScom My favourite Knockout will be the winner of tonight's match. That is @gailkimITSME of course. :) #BellToBell
@TNADixie Awesome Kong! Yes, all by herself. :) #BellToBell
A pair of wrestlers from Toronto, Ontario, Canada squaring off in tonight's Knockouts match. @gailkimITSME @ActualALove #DestinationIMPACT
@King_Ghidorah @gailkimITSME @ActualALove Better late than never. :)
@Lucha_GaryICW Damn! You're not going easy at all. :)
@King_Ghidorah Gail herself tweeted that she's wrestling Angelina tonight on Impact.
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING @DestAmerica @ActualALove Remember when you kicked Angelina's butt in a Last Knockout Standing match?
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING @DestAmerica @ActualALove Time to kick the ass of that Beautiful person! #DestinationIMPACT
@AgatioGanon @SoCalValerie @gailkimITSME Classic Gail.
@ikickyoungboys Fanbases used to fight over Trish and Lita as well.
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine Have a good date night. Isn't @TheTarynTerrell in this movie? :)
@gailkimITSME Thanks a lot. You're the best. Can't wait to see #DestinationIMPACT on this Good Friday. Surely it will be. :)
Wishing @WWEAJLee all the best wherever life leads you next. Thanks for all you've done in the world of wrestling.
When will @IMPACTWRESTLING make its debut on @fightnet in Canada? Curious.
#NJPWonAXS tonight as well? @newjapaneng
Looking forward to @IMPACTWRESTLING on @DestAmerica later tonight. Some big wrestling matches lined up. #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine Happy Good Friday. Hope it's a great Easter for you both.
Impact Wrestling's @RobbieEImpact to square off with @HackerScotty on 4/26 @smashwrestling #TheArtofWar. Interesting card of matches so far.
@sescoops @mauroranallo @AXSTV @njpw1972 @JoshLBarnett This news has made my day that much brighter. #NJPWonAXS
@AlexxiaaNicole Booo! That calls for a forearm to the face! :)
@shirai_io NJPW is very exciting pro wrestling! :)
@KarleeLeilani You are beautiful, Catrina. Wishing you a blessed rest of the week.
@HudsonEnvy @HeidiLovelace @DragonitaSPW @wolfinjapan Oedo Tai being booed by the crowd on 3/29. :-) #Stardom
I look forward to watching #LuchaUnderground at some point today as I patiently await the arrival of Friday's #DestinationIMPACT.
Hiroshi Tanahashi vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Title was such a great match. Brutal. @mauroranallo @JoshLBarnett
Hiroshi Tanahashi confirmed for the upcoming ROH/NJPW event. I must purchase a ticket for this before it's too late.
@smashwrestling I'd love to attend both events. That would be an awesome pro wrestling experience.
@TheTayaValkyrie Hope the storm passes so Milan can relax again. :o
@TheTayaValkyrie Thunderstorms can be so intense!
@ActualALove @RichardsWesley Such a beautiful couple. Nice dress. :)
@KiannaFury @LuchaElRey Let's wait and see what happens. Fingers crossed.
@KiannaFury @LuchaElRey Awesome! We finally see her again! :)
@CatherineNikita Blasted modern technology. :(
@CatherineNikita Might be a virus. Hope everything is okay soon.
@CatherineNikita My computer hasn't been healthy for a while now. :(
I've enjoyed the 3/29 #Stardom event. Some good wrestling matches and a new champion was crowned. I just have one bout left to watch.
@CatherineNikita Booooo! :(
Hojo vs. Kimura should be watched before Hojo vs. Shirai. I enjoyed both matches. #Stardom
@GKInteractive On this date in history... O.O
@gailkimITSME Did you know the Women's World Cup and Pan Am Games will be here in Canada this Summer? Exciting times.
@HeidiLovelace vs. @crushTKB? Yes please! #Stardom
@kk331ayaka Happy Birthday, Ayaka. Have an awesome special day.
@MeaganG1990 Stay classy, people!
@MeaganG1990 What are the fans chanting?
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING My fingers are crossed. :)
I wonder if we might see @gailkimITSME this Friday night on @IMPACTWRESTLING. #DestinationIMPACT #BellToBell
@smashwrestling @TARIKhatesyou DAMN!
@Karnasstories Cena's move is the WTF.
@EveTorresGracie Congratulations! Wishing you all the best in the world. :)
@Karnasstories Thanks. All is going okay. :)
@Karnasstories Wishing you a wonderful rest of the week. :)
@numero0047 Two months from now?
@WalterDaAwesome @ThePJRoberts1 @scottbox64 Haha! This is brilliant.
@Karnasstories Looking good. Nice pic. Hope all is well. :)
@RebelTNA @IMPACTWRESTLING @DestAmerica I can't wait to watch these matches. :)
Just thought I'd point out how awesome @LanaWWE looked last night at #WrestleMania.
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine @TRAINmag I hope to find this issue in stores here, Gail. Fingers crossed.
I enjoyed @kairi_hojo vs. @shirai_io for the vacant World of Stardom Title. This is pro wrestling. Congratulations Kairi. #Stardom
@gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING @fightnet Great news! Now let's see a TNA live event in the Toronto area. It's been so long. :)
@brydertna @IMPACTWRESTLING @fightnet I am happy TNA is returning to television here in Canada, and with even more programming.
TNA Wrestling (@IMPACTWRESTLING) returns to Canadian television as new deal signed: 
Wow. @SamoaJoe vs. @ROHOreilly is the ROH TV main event. #WatchROH
@BaneofWrestling Bray kicked out of the tombstone. Still lost. lol
@BradMyers17 Shooting Star Headbutt.
@Walking_Weapon I see what you did there, Josh.
@PlayerUno Uno vs. Lesnar. Book it. :)
@chasitytaylorr He's 1-0. :)
@FantaSuares Lesnar vs. Nakamura. :-)
@Melinafan20 WTF? Shouldn't security prevent such things?
Crab walk? Has Bray been watching The Exorcist? #WrestleMania
@NaomiWWE @sgovintage Awesome gear! :)
It's The Undertaker vs. Wyatt Earp. :) #WrestleMania
@GKeatdefeat @JayyWWE @gailkimITSME LOL! Too funny.
Those sitting furthest away from the ring must need binoculars to keep up with all the action! Big stadium. #WrestleMania
@EricIGN Cena did something different? Someone check the thermostat in hell. #WrestleMania
@MickieManiac Might have to track down the video once available.
@lostmikeys Better than 30 seconds.
Heard the Divas had a cool tag-team match. What say you? #WrestleMania
I was still a boy when I first attended a live WWF wrestling event. That was April 1986. Still a fan of this great sport to this day.
@RockstarSpud Tweet of the night, Spud.
@cherrrybomb Gotta love pizza! :)
Act Yasukawa is just plain awesome! She appeared in the #Stardom ring at today's Korakuen Hall event. Get well soon @yasukawaactyuka. :)
@trace_mcm Angry Hardy! lol
@trace_mcm Have four of them!
@DragonitaSPW Hope to be able to see your final Korakuen Hall match! Fingers crossed. Six exciting and talented wrestlers. #Stardom #OedoTai
Yes, I have #NJPWonAXS to be watched tonight. Excited. @mauroranallo @JoshLBarnett
@gailkimITSME @AlluringBrianna Hahaha! This tweet wins, Gail. :)
@MeaganG1990 Nikki Bella is the world's greatest wrestler.
@MeaganG1990 For the entire 4-hours? :)
@MeaganG1990 I'll be fuming no matter what. lol :-)
@Clare_Hardy_HHH Grapes are good too. :)
Hojo avenges her two 5*Star GP losses by pinning Shirai for the biggest prize of all. #Stardom
@divadirt Foxy and Rosa look beautiful.
@kairi_hojo defeated @shirai_io to become the new World of Stardom Champion today! Congratulations! Hojo is also tag-team champion.
@Irena_Janjic Busy schedule. Kick some tail. :)
@cherrrybomb @BulletClubNJPW @Machinegunka That shirt is just too sweet. #BulletClub
@gamilibre Very beautiful.
@shirai_io Good luck, Io. :) #Stardom
@Lex2018 Hope you had an awesome time at #SHIMMER71. What was your favourite match?
@koguma19980120 Beautiful sakura! :)
All the best to @wwr_stardom today at Korakuen Hall. A new World of Stardom Champion will be crowned. But who will it be? #Stardom
@The305MVP says it's time to make that phonecall. What is the #BDC up to this time? #DestinationIMPACT
@JEFFHARDYBRAND @JamesStormBrand Helluva Six Sides of Steel match, gentlemen! Thank you for all you do in the ring. #DestinationIMPACT
@GallowaySpeaks #TheRising is here to make a statement against the #BDC? Things have certainly taken an intriguing turn. #DestinationIMPACT
That was a helluva table bump @TheTarynTerrell took from a @MeanQueenK powerbomb on the floor! Respect is due, champ! #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME Yay! I've just watched this past week's Impact Wrestling! Very entertaining from open to close. Hardy vs. Storm was good. :)
@smashwrestling Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XIX. Because I was there at Safeco Field to see it live.
Big win for Kurumi dethroning Tsukasa Fujimoto ending her title reign at 615 days. I felt they had a good main event match at #IceRibbon.
OZ Academy and Ice Ribbon to be watched.
@dedysilveria Tanny Mouse!
@22nijuni We see her face again. :)
@SHIMMERwomen @MiaYim vs. @wg06athena? Gonna be a good one. Nice card of matches for round one.
@mesha_gucci @tuxedo_mask23 Guess we shouldn't be surprised. -_-
@mesha_gucci @tuxedo_mask23 Too stereotyped in WWE.
@mesha_gucci Such a crazy moment. I was always a fan of LAX.
@badboicasey That is awesome!
@badboicasey Lacey's there? Wow. :o
@mesha_gucci Did you watch when Hernandez killed Gail with a Border Toss?
@mesha_gucci ... and Homicide pinned him for the win as a totally shocked and dismayed Gail looked on.
@dajosc11 @heelstevens @HEELZiggler @TheGeneOkerlund Mean Gene! Respect is due.
Retweeted by soon-to-be WWE HOF'er Madusa! :-)
It takes two to tango! People seem to forget that for some reason.
But my favourite match at Bound for Glory 2006 was LAX vs. Daniels/Styles inside a steel cage!
@mesha_gucci I saw Sting vs. Jarrett live at Bound for Glory 2006. Angle was special enforcer for that match too.
@badboicasey Uh... AAA and CMLL?
@TheTayaValkyrie So much truth.
@Lex2018 I had almost forgotten about that. Thanks for the reminder.
#DestinantionIMPACT 
@NatbyNature will be inducting @Madusa_rocks at the Hall of Fame ceremony? That's awesome! #WrestleMania
@JamesStormBrand You win even when you lose.
@mesha_gucci You might have to wait. They're preoccupied with a tug-of-war. :)
@Lex2018 Holy smokes! Should be an awesome match. :)
@mesha_gucci It's funny because it's true.
@mesha_gucci Wow. Three big matches set for next week. Impact has become must-see television.
How was #NJPWonAXS tonight? Can't wait to get caught up.
@Lex2018 Tomoka? Didn't she retire? #confused
@RealBrookeAdams The spirit of Jawz will live on in not only your heart and mind, but in the life of any other dog to join your family. :)
@mesha_gucci One of the best they've had.
@Lex2018 Glad you made it to San Jose! Have an awesome time at #SHIMMER71. Is Kana set to compete?
@TNADixie Why must we wait an entire week for more @IMPACTWRESTLING? Well good things come to those who wait? :) #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME Now I must wait until 11am Saturday to watch @IMPACTWRESTLING on TNA's Official YouTube. Special link for Canadian fans! :)
@LeahVonDutch Hope you ladies had fun!
@RealBrookeAdams Nooo! My condolences on the loss of your beloved Jawz. #RIPJawz
@brydertna Might as well add @fightbobby to that list. I'm sure he'd like a rematch with champion @RealKurtAngle. #DestinationIMPACT
@MRayneTNA Hardcore Knockouts! O.O
GOT WOOD? @MeanQueenK @TheTarynTerrell #DestinationIMPACT
The reigning Knockouts Champion has just been put through a table! Bah gawd! @TheTarynTerrell @MeanQueenK #DestinationIMPACT
No sign of @gailkimITSME confronting @MeanQueenK this week? #DestinationIMPACT
@EthanCarterTNA I hope you and @BrodusClay are on @IMPACTWRESTLING tonight. Fingers crossed. #DestinationIMPACT
@RebelTNA @IMPACTWRESTLING When might we see Rebel vs. Kong or Brooke? :)
@RebelTNA Spill the beans. ;-)
@CatherineNikita Nice one. Can't wait to see it.
@CatherineNikita Kong speaks? :o
@EthanCarterTNA @Lagana @GallowaySpeaks EC3 stands up for what he believes in and everyone hates him for it. Hypocrites. #DestinationIMPACT

Look at him #StandUp for what he believes.  

#DestinationIMPACT
@cherrrybomb Even sleep fears the Bomb. :/
@Lucha_GaryICW @Msmelsantos @CelebVM @LuchaElRey Mil sealed his own fate when he took down Catrina, even if by accident. I agree though.
@gailkimITSME @RockstarSpud Long may you reign, champ! #DestinationIMPACT #ImWithSpud
Congrats @RockstarSpud on retaining your X-Division Championship over @OneWorldWarrior and his BDC friends. #DestinationIMPACT
@Lucha_GaryICW @Msmelsantos @CelebVM @LuchaElRey Melissa is an awesome ring announcer. She's a real beauty too. :)
@WarrenTSWells13 @JamesStormBrand @gailkimITSME @IMPACTWRESTLING Two awesome wrestling talents.
@TheTarynTerrell You were in Spike Lee's remake of Oldboy? :o
@MRayneTNA @RockstarSpud The Queen picking the BDC to win? O.O #DestinationIMPACT
@CatBinaNina @realmickfoley @NoelleFoley Lucky fans! :)
@JamesStormBrand @IMPACTWRESTLING I'm astounded by the fact people fail to realize James Storm is the smartest man in TNA.
@TNADixie @RobKovach999 Very excited about tonight's Six Sides of Steel main event match. #DestinationIMPACT
#DestinationIMPACT started a few minutes ago! @JEFFHARDYBRAND vs. @JamesStormBrand inside the steel cage tonight. Who wins? @TNADixie
@TNADixie @Sting Not too shabby for a guy who's been sitting at home on the couch all these years. :-)
@smashwrestling That reveal in the most recent newsletter is most intriguing. #TheArtofWar
@FantaSuares I see two great wrestlers... and Triple H. :)
@AlexxiaaNicole It's a tough job... but somebody's gotta do it. :)
@RebelTNA @IMPACTWRESTLING Who's your pick in the Six Sides of Steel main event match? #DestinationIMPACT
@smashwrestling Matt Cross, of course. @MDoggMattCross.
@divadirt That worked out well.
@SoCalValerie Happy Birthday! Have an amazing day. :)
Friday is here! Time for @IMPACTWRESTLING on @DestAmerica. What will happen when @JEFFHARDYBRAND meets @JamesStormBrand in a steel cage?
I thoroughly enjoyed this week's #LuchaUnderground. Two title matches in one night. @LuchaElRey
@theprinceofny Since November.
@theprinceofny 
@theprinceofny I wish it were still around. #confused
@mesha_gucci I enjoy being able to watch Impact Wrestling without commercial breaks.
@mesha_gucci TNA no longer exists on Canadian television. Instead I watch each week on their YouTube channel. No shame.
@reymysterio has announced his retirement from professional wrestling? Is this accurate?
@smashwrestling @TARIKhatesyou @TysonDux Make it a No Countout match! #TheArtofWar
@FoodPornsx @theprinceofny Yes please!
@SoCalValerie Good morning, Val. Have a great day.
@HeidiLovelace @HudsonEnvy @DragonitaSPW @wwr_stardom @StardomUSA All the best this Sunday at Korakuen, ladies. Big event. #Stardom
@RebelTNA The extreme cold made the bones in my hands hurt this past winter. That was kinda scary.
@smashwrestling Yet another entertaining edition of #SmashTV. Thank you. Nice match between Dux and Tarik.
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine This is a nice pic. :)
Swear I tweeted and pinned the KO video before, but it disappeared? #confused
Knockouts TItle triple threat: @TheTarynTerrell (c) vs. @gailkimITSME vs. @MeanQueenK (3/20 Impact Wrestling) 
@KiannaFury Awesome t-shirt. :)
@Lucha_GaryICW @LuchaElRey I Want Lucha, to the tune of I Want Candy.
@SmartassesNet Both Kpop stars? I'm not surprised. :)
@gailkimITSME Lashley vs. Grado. :-)
@AXEtheMercenary The difference between mark and smark is a single letter. :)
@AXEtheMercenary How about we all just be wrestling fans?
Jumonji Sisters vs. NanaKairi is as much fun as you might expect. 3/11 SENDAI tag-team main event. 
@smashwrestling Helluva roster of talent. Give the women of wrestling a chance to do what they love! Wrestle the crap outta each other. :)
@JewellsMalone Love this pic! :)
@DeathToAllMarks @WeeklyWPodcast @RealPaigeWWE Hahahaha! What the hell? :)
@gailkimITSME @TheMarkHenry Eat Defeat is the perfect name for it. :)
@Clare_Hardy_HHH Who? :/
If viewing tweets from blocked accounts on Twitter search proved anything, it's that some people never change no matter how many years pass!
@narumiyamaki Congratulations on your CMLL-Reina International Championship victory over La Amapola @REINAjoshi. :)
@Lex2018 @REINAjoshi Bull Nakano was the first champion in 1992.
@VampNikki Now where have we seen this behaviour before? Oh right.
@SexyStarAAA Hola, Sexy Star!
@GoddessOfCats @WWECreative_ish Even better.
@MeaganG1990 We will have to wait and see. Fingers crossed. :)
@Lex2018 @REINAjoshi Amapola's first reign as CMLL World Women's Champion lasted 1,442 days. She won the title in 2007 and lost it in 2011.
@Lex2018 @REINAjoshi The CMLL-Reina International Championship was established in 2012 in Japan, not Mexico.
@Lex2018 @REINAjoshi The CMLL World Women's Title has been around since 1992. It's a championship that rarely changes hands.

@BritishBootCamp on Tour airs TONIGHT 10pm @ChallengeTV exclusively in the UK! 
@MeaganG1990 This one. 
@MeaganG1990 Did you see Gail's tweet? :)
@WWECreative_ish @KFabeConnection A unicycle.
@RealJackSwagger Happy Birthday. Have a good one.
@gailkimITSME @TheMarkHenry Is it true Henry coined Eat Defeat, Gail?
But I wish to see @XandraBale and @the_catpower matches from today's event. :)
Kana's team lost a trios tag-team match and thus she's out as REINA's general produce (manager?). Hikaru Shida has taken up that position.
Syuri defeated La Silueta (2-1) to retain the CMLL World Women's Championship. A successful first defense at REINA today.
Maki Narumiya defeated La Amapola to become the new REINA-CMLL International Champion at the @REINAjoshi event at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo.
@hiroyomatsumoto Very clear and blue. It is beautiful.
Big day for @REINAjoshi at Korakuen Hall. All the best to the roster of wrestlers scheduled to compete in matches.
@XandraBale @the_catpower All the best, ladies. Kick some tail.
@CatherineNikita @RebelTNA @gailkimITSME @LeeSouthPhoto I third this idea. It's a winner. :)
@gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine You're just killin' it with that dress, Gail. :) What a beautiful couple.
@CatherineNikita Seems the pot is boiling over. Can't wait to watch this episode. :)
@CatherineNikita A boat? That's different from a plane! :-)
@CatherineNikita Please tell me someone asked Bobbi if she's answering to HYDRA.
@LanaWWE Happy Birthday! Hope you're having a great one.
@TheTarynTerrell Lucky lady! :)
@RealBrookeAdams Fingers crossed for Jawz to pull through. #PrayForJawz
Yay! Act Yasukawa certainly seems to be in fine spirits! Hope her recovery is going well. :) @yasukawaactyuka
@MeaganG1990 Consistency and avoiding the DL are key. :)
@YoshiTatsuIsm Looks like a delicious breakfast. :)
@HaniaHuntress Your eyes though. :)
@MeaganG1990 Do you see your Yankees clinching top spot?
@MeaganG1990 I'll be laughing too. Maniacally.
@HudsonEnvy What is women's wrestling? I support of women who wrestle.
@MeaganG1990 The Blue Jays will fail to win the AL East yet again!
@ATPWrestling A BORT LESNAR?
@MeaganG1990 Bring on baseball season!
@VampNikki There's a photoshop edit featuring Sable's Playboy issue making the rounds on Twitter.
@VampNikki Is that how Raw ended last night? Lame.
@MeaganG1990 Thanks for the info. :)
@MeaganG1990 "The uploader has not made the video available in your country."
@MeaganG1990 Doe? :)
@JoeyStyles Welp.
@VampNikki Like the Young Bucks, right?
@gailkimITSME @mraynenetwork @MRayneTNA This artwork is fantastic.
@aiwrestling This has awesome written all over it.
@gailkimITSME How come it's not Friday yet? The wait for another Impact is so long. :-)
Wrestling fans are their own worst enemy!
Funny how fans start watchng certain promotions and suddenly fancy themselves all-knowing experts on every aspect of pro wrestling!
The block option comes in handy on days like this.

See Kong vs Gail vs Taryn #KnockoutsTitle from @DestAmerica 

@gailkimITSME @AllNattyGymster @JoeyRyanOnline @EthanCarterTNA @sundownmotel Yeah, because WWE matches are unscripted and 100% real. lol
@gailkimITSME @LeeSouthPhoto She's a Knockout. Nice pic. :)
@SoCalValerie Awesome pic! :)
@midbreathcom @kairi_hojo Nice shirt. :)
@JuanWWETNA #9 spot for our Gail. :)
@JuanWWETNA Did Son Ye-jin earn a spot on the list? :)
@SmartassesNet @gailkimITSME A spot in the top 10 on a list of 100 beautiful women isn't too shabby. So badass she's sexy! :)
@JuanWWETNA @SmartassesNet I'm dying here! So many beautiful women on this list. How on earth do they choose number one? :)

Jeff Hardy is BACK! 
And he wants James Storm!  

@DestAmerica 
WrestleMania is next weekend. I'm just curious to find out who wins the Red Belt at Stardom on Sunday. #Stardom
@Kimber_Lee90 Great shot.
@gailkimITSME Because it's badass! ;)
@KoreanFood How dare they limit pics of such delicious food. :(
@smashwrestling My ticket is bought. #GiveDivasAChance
@gailkimITSME Your 8x10 pic with the Knockouts Title and the Knockouts Tag-Team Title is ace! Love it.
@smashwrestling I'm reminded of why I quit watching that company some time ago!
@gailkimITSME @SuplexWrestling Excited to see your shirt design when the time comes. Great news. :)
@CatherineNikita Top story on the 11 o'clock news! :)
@SoCalValerie @LeeSouthPhoto Wow. Awesome tribute, Val. Love these pics. :)
I approve of Hikaru Shida and Sareee as a tag-team! Nice match with Michiko Miyagi and Ray.
@CatherineNikita I have no idea. How's about Nattie? :(
Wow. Sting sure has changed since he was in The Police. ;-)
@CatherineNikita Indeed. Imagine if they had Madusa defend the original women's title at Mania.
@CatherineNikita Give Tamina a shot as champ already. -_-
@CatherineNikita Oh right. That pesky other title they're now using. ;)
@artshimko @smashwrestling That Mike Bailey fella though! O.O #AGS3
@gailkimITSME One could easily devote an entire blog entry pointing out how the movie differs from Koushun Takami's novel.
@CatherineNikita That was Mickie vs. Trish, if I'm not mistaken.
@CatherineNikita Just give us a 4-way for 10 at Mania. #WishfulThinking
@CatherineNikita The incessant aggravation of being a Divas fan!
@CatherineNikita Nothing surprises me anymore.
Mayu Iwatani and Jumonji Sisters vs. Oedo Tai on 3/29 should be a good wrestling match! #Stardom @HeidiLovelace @HudsonEnvy @DragonitaSPW
@CatherineNikita It's always the good ones. :(
@gailkimITSME She lost her battle with cancer, Gail. Here's a link. 
@CatherineNikita Me neither. :(
@cherrrybomb The Bomb is all over the place! :)
@CatherineNikita Yes, she lost her battle with cancer. So sad. 
@gailkimITSME Canadian actress Alberta Watson has passed away. You might recall her as Madeline Pierce in Nikita. :(
@RebelTNA Best. Pic. Ever. :)
@ikickyoungboys Dean who? *walks off*

Go behind the scenes of the UK tour w/the Final 6 in this @ChallengeTV exclusive documentary! htt…
@ikickyoungboys What happened now?
@RebelTNA @cesarmillan Love this pic. So adorable. :)
@DaSilvaMMA @TheEddieEdwards @RichardsWesley @smashwrestling Ummm... Wolves vs. Super Smash Bros. @PlayerUno @stu_dos. #TheArtofWar
@sendaisach1ko @dashchisako @nanaracka @kairi_hojo Excellent tag-team wrestling match on 3/11 at SENDAI. :)
@smashwrestling @RichardsWesley @TheEddieEdwards YES! One of my favourite tag-teams. Let the hunt begin. @TheWolvesNation #TheArtofWar
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 That's an awesome pic!
@mesha_gucci The next one will soon be here.
I enjoyed Kyoko Kimura vs. Meiko Satomura and Jumonji Sisters vs. Seven Sea Miles was a helluva main event at SENDAI on 3/11.
@smashwrestling That was a surprise reveal in the latest newsletter! :) #ArtofWar
This Dalton Castle fella though. #WatchROH
Bobby Fish vs. Roderick Strong. #WatchROH
Stardom Cafe is such a fun show! Just wish I understood Japanese. Kairi Hojo appears to be in search of the perfect yacht. Silly pirates. :)
@gailkimITSME I'm guessing this isn't a ringing endorsement. :-)
@CatherineNikita We will have to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks (and with the next round of tapings).
@CatherineNikita I wonder if Gail is still feeling that neckbreaker from their Lockdown match last year? :-)
@CatherineNikita It's possible. They've pre-taped so much that the spoilers have become a blur for the most part.
@CatherineNikita Spud vs. Andrews would be a fun match for the X-Division Title.
@CatherineNikita Noam Dar is another. So many talented wrestlers out of the UK right now.
@CatherineNikita 100% agreed. Do hope we haven't seen the last of Kay Lee Ray. But we can still follow her wrestling regardless. :)
Still miffed we never got Kong vs. Jackie back in the day. Gail vs. Ayako was a dream I had once upon a time. :/
@CatherineNikita The UK crowds are so electric. It's different from the North American fans at this point.
@CatherineNikita Kong is quite a wrestler to behold in person. :)
@CatherineNikita My Gail streak ran from 2004 until 2010. :(
@CatherineNikita Fingers crossed for you. Never give up hope. :)
@CatherineNikita I hope you're able to finally see them both wrestle live and perhaps even meet them as well. That would be awesome!
@CatherineNikita Haven't seen Gail wrestle live since she tagged with Evan Bourne to defeat Zack Ryder and Alicia Fox on Raw in 2010. O.O
@WeeklyWPodcast @WrasslinTweets @JohnnyGargano @MDoggMattCross @smashwrestling Booooooooooooo! :) #FourthGunn
@CatherineNikita She wasn't mentioned by name but the description fit her to a tee.
@CatherineNikita Me neither. Remember when WWE Magazine kinda hinted at Gail being involved with Tajiri's stable on SmackDown?
@CatherineNikita Oh that's right. I'd forgotten about that.
@CatherineNikita Was her second run theme ever given a name?
@CatherineNikita Are you a fan of Puppets on a String?
@CatherineNikita Her first theme was International Woman.
@CatherineNikita At least she was given a chance to wrestle back then.
Gail's WWE career began and ended with a battle royale match.
@JuanWWETNA @SmartassesNet @gailkimITSME Soon come.
@SmartassesNet @JuanWWETNA @gailkimITSME Forever number one in our hearts. :)
I love wrestling but there are things I won't do: watch the final matches of Perro Aguyao Jr., Mitsuharu Misawa and Plum Mariko.
@JuanWWETNA @KarleeLeilani You don't take out Catrina and get away with it. #LuchaUnderground
@Lucha_GaryICW @JuanWWETNA Pure insanity! O.O
@JuanWWETNA Ryck broke the kendo stick with one swing! O.O
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 That's awesome! I haven't seen Marcela, Skadi or Sumie live iin person, but Watanabe was a treat.
@xRuthStarx No harm in that. :)
@King_Ghidorah @Lex2018 Nice one! Marcela was on the card?
@xRuthStarx Why wasn't this aired on Impact? For shame. :(
@TWrestlingmag @RealKurtAngle This match was so good, but it also left me wanting a rematch.
That time I met @TherealAbyss, shook his hand and got his autograph!
@AAWPro @itsvedatime @SamoaJoe @Walking_Weapon Oh snap! This should be a helluva match. Wish I could be there to witness this one.
@xRuthStarx I was such a fan of AMW/Gail and the Planet Jarrett faction a lifetime ago! Let's pretend the Hogan-era never happened. lol
@AllHailGailKim is firmly in control here. :)
@xRuthStarx I met James Storm (and Chris Harris) at BFG '06 fanfest.
@JuanWWETNA What sort of opportunity do you see the eventual winner earning?
@newjapaneng @AXSTV I've really enjoyed #NJPWonAXS so far. Great matches and quality commentary. Hope it sticks around.
How amazing was @Kimber_Lee90 vs. @CandiceLeRae on 3/15 @smashwrestling #AGS3? Watch and see for yourself. Available now. #OnDemand
@LanceStorm Was it written by Nancy Grace?
@TWrestlingmag @gailkimITSME Even the WWE one? :-)
@JuanWWETNA So good. I've been enjoying their best-of-five series thus far. #LuchaUnderground
@Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah No, it's a community centre. A new location for Smash events after a string of dates elsewhere.
@gailkimITSME LOL! I finally understand this tweet... 13 minutes later. o.O
@RobertIrvine @gailkimITSME LOL! O.O
@gailkimITSME Without Battle Royale there would be no Hunger Games.
I wonder what @gailkimITSME would think of the movie Battle Royale.
@PectacuIar @MrPEC_Tacular @ActualALove Two's company! :)
Never underestimate the importance of having a doctor at ringside.
@mraynenetwork @MRayneTNA That's why she's the Queen! One reason anyway. :)
A wrestling show kicking off with a... wrestling match? What a concept. #DestinationIMPACT

9pm TONIGHT on @ChallengeTV!

#AngleVsLashley
#UltimateX 
The 3/11 SENDAI event and STARDOM Cafe #12 on my viewing agenda for Sunday.
@gailkimITSME Beautiful pic. Beautiful couple.
@smashwrestling Nice work on the #AGS3 trailer video! Everyone should watch this pro wrestling event.
@Lucha_GaryICW Check out this #AGS3 video... 
@Lex2018 @King_Ghidorah This is where I was on 3/15... 
@kairi_hojo I hope you will be okay. :)
@AXEtheMercenary That was pretty cool and clever of her.
@realsuyung Who dare do you wrong? :(
@KarleeLeilani I knew Mil would regret taking you down like that. You do not mess with Catrina and get away with it. #LuchaUnderground
Drago vs. Aerostar was a good wrestling match as well. I'm enjoying their best-of--five series so far. #LuchaUnderground
That #GraveConsequences match was insane on this week's #LuchaUnderground. Fenix and Mil went all out, but only one man claimed victory!
Happy Birthday @stardom_momo. Have a great day. :)
@RealCenk98 @TheTarynTerrell @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK The Knockouts match was so much fun!
@AXEtheMercenary @KarleeLeilani This tweet does not tell me who wins and I thank you for that. :-)
#Stardom Cafe #12 shall be watched tonight.
I quite enjoyed @nanaracka vs. @stardom_momo from the 3/8 #Stardom event. Momo is a rookie wrestler to keep an eye on. :)
@gailkimITSME @TrentMeyer09 What *is* coming, Gail? Haha :)
All of a sudden Twitter is filled with experts on AAA and Lucha Libre!
@NaomiWWE You are beautiful. Talented too. :)
@AXEtheMercenary I shall get caught up on #LuchaUnderground tonight.
@VampNikki You better lose that shit, Nikki. :p
It was nice to see @MagnusOfficial and @MickieJames gain a measure of revenge on @BramTNA last night. What next in this heated storyline?
@Shanna_WP 100% agreed. Well said.
"Thank you women of Joshi" You're thanking women of women? That's something right there.
The 3/11 Sendai event added to my watchlist.
It's interesting to watch AJW Mariko Yoshida before her rebirth at ARSION a few years later.
The Bull Nakano/Akira Hokuto vs. Manami Toyota/Mariko Yoshida match from Pyongyang, North Korea features some rather weird camera angles.
@KarleeDaniels @HAVOKTNA Don't miss Havok killing bitches! :)
@BaneofWrestling @RULLUR Here you go! :) 
@BaneofWrestling @RULLUR I still love the tweet Gail sent her one time.
@HAVOKTNA Wishing you all the best in the world. Kick some ass at SHIMMER!
@Lucha_GaryICW I'm going to miss seeing and hearing the UK crowds.
Is next week's @IMPACTWRESTLING from Orlando, Florida?
@BaneofWrestling @RULLUR Don't give the wicked witch any ideas.
@RondaRousey Love this pic.
World Heavyweight Championship Title: @fightbobby (c) vs. @RealKurtAngle (3/20/15 Impact Wrestling): 
Knockouts Championship Title: @TheTarynTerrell (c) vs. @gailkimITSME vs. @MeanQueenK (3/20/15 Impact Wrestling): 
Here's @gailkimITSME vs. @TheTarynTerrell from One Night Only: Rivals 2015 - 
@gailkimITSME @EatThisNotThat Poop? Agent Orange? o.O
I cannot begin to fathom what @reymysterio must be going through right now. #RIPPerro
@gailkimITSME @EatThisNotThat A bit scared to click. o.O
@gailkimITSME How did it feel being in the ring wrestling Kong for the first time since 2008? :)
@KarleeDaniels @RichardsWesley @ActualALove @REALLiSAMARiE Hahaha. This rules.
My mind just keeps getting worse and worse. -_-
@gailkimITSME Still more wins to come for you. No doubt. :)
It's tragic what happened to Perro Aguayo Jr. My heart goes out to his family &amp; the wrestlers involved... 
@MiaYim Show that gym who's boss!
@TheTarynTerrell looked none too pleased with herself after pinning @gailkimITSME. It's clear she wants to topple the monster @MeanQueenK.
The only thing missing from this week's @IMPACTWRESTLING was @EthanCarterTNA and @BrodusClay. Perhaps next week? #DestinationIMPACT
Congratulations @RockstarSpud on your victory to become X-Division Champion! Perfectly timed. Can't wait to see what's next for you. :)
I'm saying that @IMPACTWRESTLING has been very entertaining with quality pro wrestling since the switch to @DestAmerica. #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME @TheTarynTerrell That sunset flip powerbomb though... #KnockoutsTitle
@King_Ghidorah @RealKurtAngle @fightbobby Overall a very entertaining Impact. Things have been on fire since the move to @DestAmerica. :)
@gailkimITSME My results list no longer exists so I'm unable to check. Booo! :(
@gailkimITSME I'm probably wrong and you won at One Night Only tagging with Sonjay, right? :o
I swear we haven't seen Gail win a match since at least October.

@TheTarynTerrell @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK Good bout for the #KnockoutsTitle last night. This match did not disappoint. #DestinationIMPACT
Why did @IMPACTWRESTLING air a replay of Kong vs. Taryn from two weeks ago before the @TheTarynTerrell vs. @gailkimITSME @MeanQueenK match?
Wow. @RealKurtAngle and @fightbobby had a great match for the World Heavyweight Title. Thank you. Congratulations, Kurt. #DestinationIMPACT
Thank you and goodnight, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. Such a terrible loss. Condolences to his family, friends and @luchalibreaaa.
@gailkimITSME Awesome London pics, Gail. Nice gear too. :)
The team of Mio Shirai and Tsukushi won the International Ribbon Tag-Team Titles defeating Maki Narumiya and Risa Sera. #iceribbon
REINA has an intriguing card set for its 3/25 event at Korakuen Hall. A pair of CMLL titles on the line, plus Kana must resign if she loses.
Holy smokes! Kurumi has dethroned Tsukasa Fujimoto to become the new ICEx60 Champion ending her title reign at 615 days! #iceribbon
@gailkimITSME Nice London shirt, Gail. Can't wait to watch tonight's Impact. :)
@VampNikki Twitter is suddenly awesome again.
@IMPACTWRESTLING @MeanQueenK @TheTarynTerrell @gailkimITSME @DestAmerica The fans are the real winners here.
@VampNikki I knew my timeline was missing someone. :-)
@BrianStiffler @RealKurtAngle @fightbobby @DestAmerica Who's your pick to win? Angle or Lashley? :)
@Kimber_Lee90 @SHIMMERwomen @cherrrybomb Awesome pic of an awesome tag-team! #KimberBombs
@Kimber_Lee90 The cuckoo's nest.
@gailkimITSME @DestAmerica Who's your pick tonight? Angle or Lashley? #DestinationIMPACT
@gailkimITSME Hi Gail. Have you seen Captain America: The Winter Soldier? Awesome movie so it is.
@MiaYim @BrianStiffler The bones of your opponents once you're done picking them? :)
@JeremyBorash @DestAmerica Gonna be awesome tonight.

Angle v Lashley
Ultimate X
Taryn v Gail v Kong
Hardy v Storm No DQ

9/8c on @DestAmerica 
@gerrystrauss @gailkimITSME @RobertIrvine @wherewomencook Is this available in Canada?
@stopbeingfamous @The305MVP Ask Anna Politkovskaya.
@divadirt I had two in my mind, but will choose one, her name is @Kimber_Lee90.
@gailkimITSME and Kong squaring off in a match for the first time since August 2008. Taryn the defending champion too! Exciting times.
@gailkimITSME @DestAmerica @TheTarynTerrell @IMPACTWRESTLING Can't wait to see Impact over the next several weeks. :)
@gailkimITSME @DestAmerica @TheTarynTerrell I am looking forward to seeing this KO Title triple threat. @IMPACTWRESTLING has been great.
#LuchaUnderground still to be watched. There are #GraveConsequences for not doing so and failure is not an option. @KarleeLeilani
@CatherineNikita @lizzie20114 Latest #AgentsofSHIELD poster art teases the return of Ward and Agent 33. 
Kyoko Kimura &amp; Hudson Envy vs. Takumi Iroha &amp; Reo Hazuki (STARDOM) - 
@JOSEPHPARK_esq @RobbieEImpact @IMPACTWRESTLING "Carefully drafted on a sharkboy 8x10." Brilliant. :-)
Happy Birthday @kimurarock. Hope your special day is amazing!
@HudsonEnvy and @kimurarock vs. @hazukireo0706 and @crushTKB is such an entertaining tag-team wrestling match. #Stardom
Exclusive:  BDC Members Make Their Predictions On This Friday's Angle vs...: 
@CatherineNikita I wonder what will become of Cal. That fellow with no eyes rescued Raina a couple weeks ago.
@BaneofWrestling No matches starting or ending during commercial breaks here. Plus the commentary is a refreshing change as well.
@BaneofWrestling It's amazing that we're given a full match for an entire episode.
@CatherineNikita Ward is certainly due for a return. Hope we see him in the next episode. Wonder what he's been up to?!
@CatherineNikita Just finished watching last night's episode. So good. I could not believe the clips for next week. It's like a civil war?
@CatherineNikita Bobbi and Mack are traitors! -_- #AgentsofSHIELD
Just watched the latest #NJPWonAXS. Okada vs. Naito was a very enjoyable match as one might expect.
@lizzie20114 I'll be watching this week's episode tonight. I'm prepared to be shocked again. :o
Now listening to @EthanCarterTNA entrance theme! Because it's awesome.
@Lex2018 Io Shirai defeated Kairi Hojo in the annual 5*Star GP tournament in both 2013 and 2014.
@lizzie20114 The best series. :)
@AXEtheMercenary @gailkimITSME @DestAmerica Crazy match!
@SoCalValerie Haha! Smart lady. :)
@SoCalValerie I'm convinced it's impossible for you to take a bad selfie. ;)
@AXEtheMercenary @RealBrookeAdams is on the rise. :)
@Lex2018 Io and Kairi have fought before the GP tournament. Hojo lost twice if memory serves. Two very talented competitors no doubt.
@EthanCarterTNA How about a birthday wish from your best friends @RockstarSpud and @mrkenanderson?
New Japan, Stardom and Agents of SHIELD still to be watched. One of these things is not like the other.
@Machinegunka @REALBully5150 @ImpactDOC Yes, please.
@Lex2018 I'm unsure of the 3/29 main event. Io, Kairi, Takumi and Kimura will be wrestling for the vacant title. Single match? I'd pick Io.
@ActualALove So much truth in that one statement.
@FollowMe_Seth @RebelTNA Gorgeous! A stunning work of art. Nice motorcycle too. Hehehe :-)
@cherrrybomb There is so much awesome in this one pic.
@hemmepowered Check this out @MeaganG1990. :)
@cherrrybomb @smashwrestling Best superkicks ever though.
Here I was expecting @wolfinjapan and @HeidiLovelace to battle each other in the ring with @hatuhinodekamen. :-) #Stardom #OedoTai
Couldn't I just hibernate until April 26? @smashwrestling #ArtofWar
@CatherineNikita @AdriannePalicki Well, isn't Mockingbird a double agent? :)
@CatherineNikita Ward is conspicuous by his absence thus far.
@dj1995dj1 Jawz is so adorable. #PrayforJawz
@CatherineNikita Oh no! Last week was epic. :(
@CatherineNikita I shall wait for a download. :(
@gailkimITSME Avoiding stereotypes. lol
@gailkimITSME @CatherineNikita @IMPACTWRESTLING That would be a helluva triple threat match, Gail.
@gailkimITSME @GarySinise @GarySiniseFound Happy Birthday!
@Lex2018 We'll find out on 3/29 who the next World of Stardom Champion will be.
@RealBrookeAdams Wishing Jawz a full recovery. Hoping everything will be okay. #PrayforJawz
@dj1995dj1 Consider it done.
@AnnaliseIrvine That's awesome. Congratulations! :)
