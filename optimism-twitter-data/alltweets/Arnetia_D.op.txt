@MarilynMosbyEsq Thank You. #BlackLivesMatter #BlackWomenLead

@Made_InTokyo I used to hate that lol. But maybe they really want that "A" lol
@willied92 Yo! I'm officially a @Wale fan now!  
Justice for Hector. Praying for his family.
"It is your pain, that leads to your passion, that leads to your purpose" @RepCummings -Love this statement!
Do you think it makes you sound sophisticated condemning and shaming the ppl of Baltimore? No, it makes you sound clueless and oppressed.
@melodic22 @MannyEve Wishing the 3 of us were at Campus Trace venting right now.
@melodic22 @MannyEve I haven't been able to gather my rage &amp; formulate my thoughts around this. It has infuriated me for hours and hours.
@BWigg43 I was just thinking about this last night. The simple fact that he got SO many ppl on one accord amazes me.
It was so therapeutic being with @CallMeUncleL this evening. I Luh you girl!
@VivaLaMarie I love it! Speak your truth and most importantly stay safe. Who knows, I may run into you again.
My relationship with my mom is a true blessing.
But this... <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES> 
Music really brings out my ratchet/wild side.
My wiz kids are making me so proud <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Besides the score, this celtics and cavaliers game is entertaining. Lol
<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️everything about this!  
@MannyEve Yas! It is so necessary. Good luck with finals boo!
My weight, my salary &amp; my relationships may change for better or for worse. But I'll always be me &amp; I'm cool w/ that. We all should be.
I find myself constantly trying to remind my friends of their beauty and their worth. But I am tired of sounding like a broken record.
@willied92 it won't be now if you call me buckwheat again.
@willied92 But you dating me tho. <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>
@willied92 LMAO! Omg. Shutup! I look cute.
@DaddyofDC Bahahahahaa! I cannot! Me and my tomboy self! Miss those days!!! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@WilshireRoyalty Don't do it! That used to be me.
That awkward moment when something you thought was innocent quickly becomes a "situation"
@kilog92 Yas! Courtney wouldn't have it any other way. Excited to see you!
@kilog92 graduation!?
I am sooo pressed! The highest legal official in the nation is a black woman. Ahhh, today's a great day.
So proud to be a strong black woman especially today! I support  #LorettaLynch congrats on your confirmation!
I can't stress enough how much I love the ppl around me. My fam, best friends and professional circle are constantly cheering for me!
Really wishing Courtney was here, or that I was with her.
Hopefully me eating like a good girl, will pay off this summer <SEE-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@willied92 Okay Fatty. We will go this week.
Staring at me really isn't going to make me like you, it's going to make me afraid of you.
So proud of myself man. So proud.
Sometimes ppl &amp; situations are intended to hurt us SO badly, just to ensure that we never get the urge run back to them.
Well I have had a very interesting evening so far. I wonder who I'll bump into next.
@mtsjr421 Omg! I'm looking at Alexandria, study parties on deck! Lol
@mtsjr421 I see! It had the big city feel, without the big city noise.
I never thought I would live in NoVa. But that open house was everything!
I sat outside and studied this evening and it was so relaxing.
Very interesting.... 
I'm clearly not a reporter, but I am surrounded by the news 24/7 and I must second that it does get depressing. It numbs you.
This is great! S/O Alamance County!

@doriantolivia You're welcome love &amp; Of course!
Today has the potential to be very busy.
@doriantolivia Your avi is gorg! <SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES>
It sucks realizing that you're the only one in your corner.
And yet...another one. #BlackLivesMatter  
LOVE THIS!  
I'm just up doing some much needed thinking.

@Orig_Production Miss you too!
@Orig_Production So I love the words in your bio and the meaning behind it. That is all.
#LRT I saw something on the news yesterday stating something similar &amp; prison reform has been on my mind since!
My ice cream truck was so inconsistent when I was growing up...but now that I'm grown you want to come everyday and taunt me.
#LRT The fairest, most qualified selection of women leaders! I wouldn't be opposed to any of them being chosen.

My life would be SO lost, confused &amp; worthless without my daily to-do lists.
@willied92 I feel the same way love! So much fun! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@thehonorableabb this is true. You are my ultimate bae. <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Just casually talking about baby hairs with @Nathan_Smith10
Yo, I am a sucker for deep stimulating conversations about societal drifts and changes. If you can give me that, you're bae.
Good food with good people! That lunch just made my day. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@willied92 &amp; it is most definitely appreciated! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<FACE THROWING A KISS>
@mtsjr421 I miss you so much too! My hope is that we can reconnect this summer!
@jalyse893 @mtsjr421 @gesterbear21 Ugh! That sucks, ignorance and hatred at it's best. But keep your heads up &amp; stay safe! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
#ConfirmLorettaLynch
Yass NC State!
Nc State just closed the half with a bang!
Octavius Ellis is me in male form.
Cincinnati is not backing down to Kentucky. I'm routing for them now lol
Partially because, if I did do that my blood pressure would be sky high lol
I have always found it pointless to argue with ppl over the internet about racial tensions.
@DesignCreator06 Bruh. My life. But I'm learning to enjoy the journey!
Let me follow the doctor's orders.
I cheer for all North Carolina schools except for Duke.
These #CNNBeLike tweets are hilarious....but also sad because they hold a truth.
This weekend will be dedicated to studying and march madness <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
When you truly know your worth. You stop giving ppl discounts.
Slowly transforming into the person I was always meant to be. Proud of me <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Everytime I look at that picture of Martese Johnson it looks like an image from the 60's but it's 2015. #JusticeForMartese #BlackLivesMatter
Look at Nathan being clutch.
Ppl are gonna start calling me and @willied92 "the hope" if @S_Ross_ keeps it up! Lol
@OgaKenny Bahaha! To be determined lol you'll be the first to know though! Lol
Cheers to 5 years! Happy Anniversary _youngwill92 you're my personal lucky charm! #mamawemadeit… 
@JayQ03 lol I figured you would appreciate that! &amp; you're welcome.
Happy Birthday, Mr. Obsessed w/ Success, @JayQ03 I hope you enjoy your day!
This weekend was just the extra push I needed to get me through until my next mini vacay! Lol
@willied92 I love you too darling!
This is a very proud moment for me.
@Nathan_Smith10 Yass. Thank you Nathaniel.
I haven't had that many laughs in a while <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> @Nathan_Smith10
So I look like a child in this pic...but it gets the point across. Thank you so much Jessica for your… 
I wonder if he's gonna act like he doesn't see my subtweet?
Soooo, Mohammad and I just got our quizzes back.......
The Portland/Houston game is quite entertaining.
I almost forgot tomorrow is my picture day. <FLUSHED FACE>
Oh yeah, Happy 30th Birthday to one of my first friends at Elon. Lmao. @BWigg43
I think the mission of @CME4MEDC is AMAZING and I can't wait to get more involved and attend events in the near future!
I also know how lucky I am to have found them so early in my political career.
I am incredibly grateful for my two mentors. They are my big sisters, friends, and critics. I love them so much. Phenomenal women <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
An entire century hasn't gone by, yet there are undeniable similarities in the injustices Blacks face now &amp; the struggles fought before us.
I think most ppl can admit that history does repeat itself. However, I find it disappointing that it repeated itself so soon for Blacks.
@Qu4dUp_06 tell her I said hayyyyy! I miss you too! <TIRED FACE> will you be there tomorrow night?
Don't tell me I cut ppl off too quickly, and then turn around and give me a reason to add you to that list.
Wishing a happy birthday to one of the few ppl who can match my disrespect and sass! @SheGotKaiks Luh you! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@AndreMButler <WEARY FACE> I'm getting old! But you look handsome!
I just bought my ticket to see this little girl graduate @_LadyMarcy <SMIRKING FACE>
The only way to fix ANY problem, is to adjust yourself.
“@CNNPolitics: Have race relations improved since the first black president took office? 
I really miss my best friend's life @_LadyMarcy <PENSIVE FACE>
I like to have special connections with the ppl I am closest with. If anybody can connect with you the way I can, there is no need for me.
Scandal has really become a HUGE disappointment.
@willied92 Does she!?
However, I'm puzzled. Why did some Republicans want Lynch to speak against Obama, when he is the one who nominated her!?!
Loretta Lynch is amazing! Just finished watching the last part of her confirmation hearing. #blackwomenlead #BlackBrilliance
@willied92 Aww, I know!!! I love you too babe! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I just want to wish a HUGE good luck to @JessicaLBYRD tonight! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@TheSellersGoup @_ABlackman oh ok! that's really cool!
Did you make the Sellers Group? @_ABlackman
I am such a "long-term" thinker that I often struggle with enjoying the progress I have already made. That's such a bad mindset.
I wish I responded to criticism as well as Zendaya Coleman.
@_January7th lol no! It's being cultured.
@AfriKANREE tell me about it! I still get that tingling feeling whenever I hear it! Lol I miss you so much though!
16 years ago today Juvenile released one of the greatest songs ever crafted in our nations history. #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackBrillance
Sooo excited for this evening! I just love meeting new people and expanding my network <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@mtsjr421 Absolutely! Kris and I were just talking about that. A convo is long overdue!
@mtsjr421 awwww! I miss him! And actually you too lol
@JessicaLBYRD simply because you tweeted at me, pretty much means I'm a celebrity now. #overnightcelebrity
No one knows how I go from 0-100 over certain topics better than them @willied92 @_LadyMarcy @CallMeUncleL @thehonorableabb
I feel bad for ppl who speak negatively about the Obamas, Lady Gaga or Bernie Mac in my presence. They quickly become subjected to my anger.
@_lovewhittt Something I am struggling with as well. But like you said, you have to remember you get from the universe what you give it.
@Miss_K_Lavoie Aww! Good Morning!! You too <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<FACE THROWING A KISS>
@NoChillRonda of course! Enjoy your day! Be safe and see you soon! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
Happy Birthday to this beauty! <FACE THROWING A KISS> @NoChillRonda
Sometimes I get nervous to follow important people on social media, in the event that they feel the need to follow me back lol
@SASSY_Brittbrat has been keeping me so sane lately. Love her <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
But when you finally learn it, never let that feeling or that person go, because they are apart of the beauty in your life.
Sometimes it takes for something extreme to happen for you to see how much someone means to you.
Thank you so much for the fun, romantic and relaxing day! _youngwill92 Love you much! <HEAVY BLACK HEART>️ 
I love surprises and @willied92 takes full advantage of knowing that!
@willied92 @Almighty_Dex why would you ever say that? That's embarrassing lol.
Still in shock....but this healing process is nothing I can't handle. I will go on living and loving like never before!
@CallMeUncleL that's legit how we rode around when we were in college!
@willied92 I guess you will just have to wait until next Monday! Lol <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY>
@ShesO_Live @willied92 Awww thank you! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ love you too! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@willied92 and so are you! <WHITE SMILING FACE>️<HEAVY BLACK HEART>️
@NoChillRonda <WINKING FACE> yes! We both have to take care of business though lol
Sometimes things are more clear in dreams than they are in reality.
Feeling perfectly at peace, knowing I am exactly where I am meant to be.
That glorious moment when your coworker asks to take you to get a cup of coffee...free of charge <PERSON RAISING BOTH HANDS IN CELEBRATION>
Happy Birthday! I hope you enjoyed it! @BrandonJBrant <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
That's why Lynch was dancing on the side line. He had a master plan lol
Sports heals the soul. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ #Packers&amp;Colts
@willied92 I wanted to tweet at you first! Lol I was going to say you keep me so young. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@willied92 you're right!
I secretly really want to start a relationship blog. But then I think it would be a waste of time because ppl hear what they want to hear.
@_ABlackman Haha. Speak your truth.
@_ABlackman Yet again so true!
@_ABlackman So funny and so true!
Peace and blessings to Stuart Scott and his family! #CancerSucks
@willied92 So sweet! I love you so much too!!!<FACE THROWING A KISS><SMILING FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES><WEARY FACE>

@mtsjr421 Good luck love! I'm taking the October test!
@SASSY_Brittbrat What would we do without each other?
"Unbroken" was the most powerful movie I have ever seen. It was just the motivation I needed!
@willied92 Ooh lol

"Life is too short" has never meant more to me than it does right now.
Completely in awe at how romantic, chivalrous, thoughtful and loving one man can be. So grateful and so in love with @willied92 <FACE THROWING A KISS>

@willied92 That's why I love you! SO supportive. Thanks!
All women are beautiful by design! No matter how much you TRY to be like everyone else, no one will ever be like YOU! Embrace you. Love you.
You're insecurities are most evident through the treatment you allow from others.
It is most definitely difficult being a woman. But ladies, you have to get better at truly falling in love with yourself.
Another unarmed, black life lost. Peace and blessings to you and your family, Rumain Brisbon.
FaceTime makes me look super weird.
@CMartinez_ You're amazing! We need more activists in this world that act out of compassion and not for attention! Keep it up Ciera!
@jalyse893 it's so delish! I am really behind on this one!
Fogo de Chao for dinner! I could get used to living this high life lol

I miss my best friend so much <PENSIVE FACE> @_LadyMarcy

Stand w/ President Obama ➜ 
I needed to go through that in order to put things into perspective and to re-prioritize my life.
Last night was a huge wake up call for me!
Had a wonderful devotional. Night night!
If I'm getting positivity and encouragement from so many people, it doesn't make sense to focus on the one area where I'm not!
I celebrated my good news the perfect way today! Now, I'm ending it with a delicious dinner made by me <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@DaddyofDC hahahaha! Like I hate that! Girl you look dumb!
It's really not cute when you ladies take pictures of being with your man and he's on his phone. Like boo, clearly he is paying you no mind.
The posts @CallMeUncleL tags me in really makes life worth living. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
@willied92 omg! It was terrible. The hardest part was trying to pretend like we weren't. Lol
Mr. &amp; Mrs. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> _youngwill92 
Happy Birthday Bri! I love you so dearly! We have been through very dark times together and I really… 
@willied92 <WHITE SMILING FACE>️ thank you baby! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I'm really depressed.
@JayQ03 I know! Sigh. Maybe my time will come lmao.
@JayQ03 nobody argues with me because I'm a girl <WORRIED FACE> lol sad life.
That last throw didn't require griffin to do anything that isn't fundamental. He did okay, but the last throw was 100% his fault.
Like I said before, we should have just waited until after our by to play griffin.
Our defense most definitely let us down. But that last throw was pathetic! The man was wide open and Griffin through the ball at the ground.
I am in love with Bashaud Breeland. Like forreal. Sorry Willie <CONFUSED FACE>
@CallMeUncleL lazy! You better be up in time for our date!
@CallMeUncleL I want to go shopping too!
@thehonorableabb I did! But it's only cause I miss you.

@Qu4dUp_06 the fact that we both live and work here and haven't had lunch is a disgrace. #fake

@WilshireRoyalty Nope! You're the only Don Juan I know! Lol

Telling me I should be Queen Latifah for Halloween really isn't original.

Men should never make comments about how a woman behaves on her period or when shes pregnant because that is something they will never feel.
Ppl don't understand the stress and uniqueness that comes with working in politics. It makes it so difficult to talk about my job to others.
#WCW ATTENTION! Everyone please go vote for my good friend @afrikanree she has an amazing opportunity…

@NFLonFOX that was an adorable tweet!
I be wanting to "pop lock and drop it" when new flame comes on.
@CallMeUncleL you are so sick.

Crossing my fingers that something comes out of this appointment. I can't keep living like this.
Watching my second team. Let's go #PantherNation <BLUE HEART>
Morning. Slept my migraine away.
@NoChillRonda Anytime! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Consistency is my best character trait. So if I stop caring about you, most likely it is because you pushed me away.
@_LadyMarcy You have to wait in line like everyone else if you want to be a ft with me.
Pajamas, popcorn and a FaceTime date = a perfect Saturday night. <WHITE SMILING FACE>️
I know exactly what I am worth and what I deserve.....now it's time for me to start acting like it.
It is so helpful having male friends that can shed light on situations.
I love my skins dearly. But I would like to get home, this traffic is terrible.
I just want @_LadyMarcy to know that the war has only just begun.
Vegetables for dinner.....again. <UNAMUSED FACE>
Was hoping I would get better sooner than later. Guess not. <DISAPPOINTED BUT RELIEVED FACE>

I really hate myself for liking Iggy Azalea's songs.
I wouldn't be half the person I am without my circle of friends and family. They keep it 100, and they keep me in check.

@willied92 Haha! I have to be. Lol
@mtsjr421 I'm just trying to educate and liberate. Lol
To the Black men who think beating a woman isn't that serious let us remember there was a time in history when beating Black men was legal.
I can't believe I did it.
Majorities don't understand oppression the way men don't fully understand the affects and implications of domestic violence.
We are having the realest convo right now.
THE BODY JUST CAME ON THE RADIO!!!
I can't see God, but through God I am able to see everything else.
My last retweet is you @CallMeUncleL
I have listened to "The Body" 22 times since last night. Wale and Jeremih did that!
#MCM my boyfriend and my little brothers! I love these men! <FACE THROWING A KISS> @willied92 @LilTazzButler @andrembutler

I told em to save my number under big booty <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Godiva's new ice cream is amazing.
Lady gaga is life.
I'm realizing that you can't force ppl to treat you right. You have to show ppl that things change when they don't treat you right.
If someone can't respect your wishes.....then they don't respect you.
About to just watch this LSU game until I drift off.
@willied92 of course boo! I always introduce you to the finer things <INFORMATION DESK PERSON>

My mother has very ratchet tendencies.
It's hard having single friends.
@CallMeUncleL GIRL! I'll be at the next one!
@_LadyMarcy I have bags under my eyes because I am employed. But that's none of my business.
@_LadyMarcy That's probably why that man thought I graduated from college a long time ago.
Courtney had on her ole faithful jean shirt.
That was a lovely family outing with @_LadyMarcy <WHITE SMILING FACE>️

Listening to beautiful people and I thought of @Pappa__Doc and @I_Be_Smitty <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> miss you guys!!! <WEARY FACE>
I know Willie enjoys the pictures I send him.
@_LadyMarcy lol! It's not my fault I was born with this voice.
I have just accepted that I have a deep voice for a woman.
These tweets are great but we need to focus on mobilizing our efforts.
It's also troubling when Black people come up with ways to excuse this primitive behavior.
I am so disturbed by the increase in violence against Blacks.
Mad by Neyo is my song!
I don't want to become a person who doesn't have time for a social life. But that is the nature of my field.

You're beautiful, kind hearted, thoughtful, disrespectful and best of all you're a great friend and a… 
If you can't stay off your phone. Stay away from me. I hate that.
Transitioning into adulthood is like the weirdest phase ever.
Black women are innately strong, dynamic and flexible. Those are skills we need to incorporate into our leadership efforts.
One woman's victory is a victory for all women, but our Black women need to make a push in leadership.
@willied92 You know I am SO excited! #Progressive
Becky Hammond scored a victory for women today! Congrats!
First day!
That might have been the best meal I ever had.
So many changes this week. I'm not ready to be grown.
I really wish I didn't curse so much. It's not attractive but it seems so necessary.
Willie been using me for food for 5 years y'all.
I just wanted to say that I love you! @Miss_K_Lavoie Keeping soaking up New York! #FriendsForever <FACE THROWING A KISS>
Chillin with Le Bae. @willied92 
You can't be serious. Smh.
@I_Be_Smitty hahaha! I know it's very unfortunate.
Maturity is understanding life doesn't get any better, you just get better at dealing with life.
@willied92 you're about to eat shut up.
Be careful with who you fall in love with.

Spending my weekends with @_LadyMarcy &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
One of the best days I have had in a long time! I'm feeling blessed!
I basically made a complete lifestyle change in one day.
About to talk to bae until I fall asleep. @_LadyMarcy
I'm getting really used to being my own company and entertainment.
When you take people for granted. The people you were granted, get taken.
Self reflection was so key today!
Welp, I reached my breaking point.
Had to have a little talk with Jesus.
@_lovewhittt I miss you too! <WEARY FACE> you're so close yet so far! Lol

Never put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket~Unknown
Some where down the line me and Nathan are related. I'm convinced.
A friend like @SASSY_Brittbrat is priceless.
Playing temple run and going to the gym have been the only things keeping me from worrying about him 24/7.
I don't trust people that don't have their read receipts on.
@JayQ03 I figured! Aye! Turn down for what lol
@JayQ03 of course!! Gotta keep up with you lol! Will I see you this Sunday!?
I was reading through my high school year book @JayQ03 left the funniest message! Miss you! Hope all is well!!

@PinkGreenBaller Congrats Kels! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
@willied92 lol hush!
Some of you guys are so creative and spend so much time making memes but yet you can't make a PowerPoint presentation for class.
Don't complain about school work or life in general unless you're doing a senior sem paper.
I am SO tired of hearing about Donald Sterling. We get it he is racist.
My bae is SO clutch! Yes with the three free throws!
Look at bae forcing the turnover. Lol
Love and Hip Hop is an oxymoron. It is the most illogical show ever but yet it is so realistic.
When I don't know things about my self I ask @_LadyMarcy
I don't even know if I can go back and focus on my paper after that loss. I'm mad at my wizzies.
Chris Webber is annoying. How many rings do you have again?
@Nattty_Ice_  I can't wait til Saturday! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
@_LadyMarcy just invited some NC State thugs to our apartment. If they flirt with me......I will laugh.

@_LadyMarcy Funny, that was the first day we saw in each other in a month. The irony.
@_LadyMarcy Were you talking about me? Yeah, I think you were.
This is going to be a very interesting class.

Enough slaying. Britney Spears radio and homework. <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
I must admit, being the only African American in my apartment does tend to get frustrating at times. That's the price of #diversity.
My roommates ( @_LadyMarcy and @Danni_Simmons91 ) no longer love their queen ( me )
Nelson Mandela, the father of so many quotes and principles I live by, may you rest in peace.

Real friends don't attack you on twitter.
@CallMeUncleL Also, when you are reviewing your spelling words go over WILBUR again.
@CallMeUncleL it took you a while to think about that comeback. Ironically that's the same amount of time it takes your hair to grow.
@CallMeUncleL <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY> just like tracks don't have a chance with you.
Y'all, @CallMeUncleL loves me.
Same elementary school, high school and now college. How many of y'all can say that? @callmeunclel

The redskins actually gave me a migraine.
This is what happens when you don't let players play in pre season games Mr. Shanahan.......they get rusty. <UNAMUSED FACE>
RGIII is rusty, Morris has the butter fingers and the defense is tired because they have been on the field for forever.

@melodic22 @_LadyMarcy Awwwww! misses you too! ^_^
Aye @CallMeUncleL "He started a Christian Organization called...._______" sound familiar?
I am so glad me and Charlise are 5 hours apart because I would have seriously injured something from laughing so hard.
@CallMeUncleL is really about to ruin my future!! I am literally crying from trying to supress my laughter at work.
I heard Kanree's child please through her tweet.

No one is exempt from my standard curse outs...... NO. ONE.
@jalyse893 Why do we have the same life? lol Except im going back on the 16th.
Some people love to be unhappy.
I always smile when tell ppl stories about him....except for him pooping on my leg. that was pure disrespect.
I had a dream about Ceno last night. Made me realize how much I miss him. :(
I have no words for today.
The fact that I consider going back to school a break.....is sad. But Elon is a HUGE break from the real world.
I wish I would ask somebody to ask me a question. Pshh.
I really hope this works out! <GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES><GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>

I literally just had the most interesting/peculiar/flattering conversation I have ever had in my life.
I'm a senior so I'm automatically better than you.
Hmm. I feel a change coming.
@kaikocaine Lmao!!! No! I looove you.
In times of crisis everybody on twitter thinks they have a Juris Doctor, and a degree in Theology.
I need to call @_January7th for our weekly talk.
@brialynae Right! Just with them! lmaoo.
My name is the first thing that has to go.
The only problem is that he doesn't speak any English. Somehow I'll have to convince him that i'm Dominican.
@kaikocaine Lmao! that game they call "baseball"
@willied92 O.
@voirlimage I LOVE IT!
I have a new baseball crush! Spotted him last night during that homerun thing. lol
@willied92 too bad nobody cares.
@jalyse893 I know! My internship is over on the 2nd, so I will have plenty of time then! :) I still have to find that beach place tho lol :/
@jalyse893 Yea it really is! Its a little expensive though been I'm sure your stacking paper so it should be fine lol
@jalyse893 That place is all you need in a world of sin! Amazing!
That awkward moment when a ratchet is talking about other ratchets.
Awww! that's so cute.
My Lord.
In order to love someone you must respect them...and respect is defined as knowing someone's value. #Random

@ChaserWard Lmao. I think I have fallen in love with you via twitter.
Daydreaming about a nap.
Sometimes I forget I'm black.
People need to find their chill.
Don't speak confidently on things you don't know. You will sound dumber than you think.

Kyle is speaking truth, half of these Elon "thugs" are bums in their little "towns". Im the only real O.G. lol

Taking my daddy to a congressional softball game <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Top of the morning!
@melodic22 HAHAHAHAHA! That used to be my part. I would be blown when I missed it lol
The more I hear the more worried I get <FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND COLD SWEAT>
<FEARFUL FACE><FEARFUL FACE><FEARFUL FACE>
All smiles! <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH>
But let me not act like I'm Dr. Twitter lol
The fact that yall black people think Rick Ross calling Africa a country is funny is sad. He is making a mockery of your history and his!
Black vs. African is the most illogical conversation ever, the only thing that separates us is lineage.
At first it caught me off guard. lol but it was a really good convo, we know each other better now :)
Me and Leah just had our first heart to heart.
All I keep thinking about is the bet I made with Willie last night.
Ready for the week <SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH AND TIGHTLY>
Coolin just watching tv with her Yy and moms #Daddy
We had beef stew greens and rolls for dinner, baked <COOKIE>s for dessert <FACE SAVOURING DELICIOUS FOOD> #Daddy
@LagbajAlex that's commendable!
She trying be on her "running on the treadmill and only eating salad" flow this summer Ha. <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES> I'll be right by her side supporting #Daddy
<WEARY FACE> I hate reality shows but being with a woman in this day n age you will have to sacrifice and deal with it #Daddy
I bring out the fun and goofy side of her <GRIMACING FACE>. <SPEAK-NO-EVIL MONKEY> I didn't mean to toot my own <TRUMPET> #Daddy
<WAVING HAND SIGN> Waddup Arnetia followers #Daddy
Only read the newspaper when there is an article about a rapper. Hmm.
Happy birthday!! Hope you enjoy it! @LastKing_29
@CallMeUncleL I give you a year before you have a non contract phone
I know phones are tight and all but I hate when people are more engaged in their phones than with other people.
On my way out to dinner with my entire family and @willied92
@CallMeUncleL don't hate cause your destination is Burlington, NC
@brialynae @CallMeUncleL LMAO!!!!
Charlise thirsty af, talking about she miss the old heads
@brialynae @CallMeUncleL Bria always got my back!
@CallMeUncleL cause your basic.
@willied92 you weren't supposed to appreciate that lol, I was being so sarcastic
@willied92 finally hopped off celebrities, proud of you.
@_January7th Omg! I am tearing up lol jk, I love you more hood rat! (I would put an emoji but you can't see it) #teamiphone
Good morning <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>, VA bound!
We ride together<TAXI>, we die together<SYRINGE>....bad boys for life! <WOMAN WITH BUNNY EARS> @Danni_Simmons91 <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
You never know who will be the one to come through for you. Thankful for @candiceblacknal , she remained true to her word, always there!
@WilshireRoyalty Sorry, I'm slacking.
@WilshireRoyalty lol yes, because you were right at my internship earlier !
Off work early! Chinatown here I come.
I can't wait for my weekend to start <GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
Lmao! It's sad. Ppl get too hype over twitter and basketball. You sound silly threatening to unfollow ppl over their opinions.
GINOBOLI! he needs to get out the game, he can't get his shot off, too many turnovers, and makes terrible passes
Leonard is a cutie.......even with his cornrows
And Danny green needs to prove that his shooting streak is not just good luck
Ginoboli has to make better passes and chill with dribbling in traffic so the spurs can limit turnovers
Had a hilarious conversation with Charlise as usual lol <FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY>
Hmm my mother thinks she grown, going out on a work night. <SMIRKING FACE>
Humility!
Found out today that me and @jalyse893 have the same exact life!!!! <FACE THROWING A KISS>
I feel like people that go places to watch sports go for the atmosphere, cause I personally don't need all that talking when the game is on
Finally settling in from a busy day!
@PhirstAvenger Definitely! Just hit me up, I know your doing great :)
@PhirstAvenger Hey! I hope your internship is nothing short of amazing, I know mine is! Hopefully we cross paths at an event this summer!
@camila_rene arnetiad
@willied92 hmm, too late I blocked you.
The fact that my boyfriend doesn't even follow me on twitter is very unfortunate. @willied92
@jalyse893 Yayyss!
@jalyse893 We need to hang!!
Chevonne got some gossip! Nobody has time for all that lol I still love her though.
@_LadyMarcy is always trying to stay relevant... Stay in LA
@camila_rene I KNOW! but girl I get charged for calls from Alberta Canada , lets Skype!!!!!
The term "growing pains", has never had so much meaning to me ....until now.
How are my two loves gonna be arguing on twitter @CallMeUncleL and @willied92 <PENSIVE FACE> lol
On my way to a farm, this should be interesting.
He will see!
Realizing.....
Get your priorities together, there is no sense in buying a $500 bag, with $5 in it.
Me and @_LadyMarcy was rolling on face time last night, it made me miss her even more. tear.
Good Morning! <SMILING FACE WITH SMILING EYES>
