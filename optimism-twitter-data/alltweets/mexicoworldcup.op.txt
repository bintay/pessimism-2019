In the U-23 squad at the moment. RT @guero_crump: @mexicoworldcup no Jorge Espericueta!?
Mexico U-20s kick off World Cup vs. Mali on May 31 RT @8bitJose: @mexicoworldcup when do they play?
Sounds obvious for Liga MX fans, but Orbelin Pineda, Hirving Lozano, Erick Gutierrez and Erick Aguirre also ones to watch for El Tri U-20s.
Looking forward to seeing Atletico Madrid's Diego Gama and Porto's Raul Gudiño for Mexico U-20s.
Just had a chat to Mexico U-20 coach Sergio Almaguer. He's happy and optimistic he's picked the right squad and El Tri will do well in NZ.
@cesarhfutbol If you hadn't said anything, maybe nobody would've ever known …
Mexico's U-20 World Cup squad: 
@MrtDanny Usually is, no doubt. However, the list he gave only has 21 names, for example … so there are two places still to be taken.
@MrtDanny we'll see if he is on the list, but injuries have really hurt Ponchito's chances.
Said before that I imagine Euro clubs would prefer Mexico's players to be at June's Copa America, then rest ahead of preseason.
Miguel Herrera basically said earlier this week that it was Rafa Marquez's decision, hinting it had something to do with his club.
Couple of lists coming out that indicate Rafa Marquez could be selected for the Copa America and not Gold Cup.
Happy birthday, @Chivas! 109 years old today.
Another Mexican youngster to watch out for RT @canchamural: Daniel Álvarez @AtlasFC 
@ChopGod_10 @I_Resendis Yep. Mexicans have a good record in the Netherlands.
2-0 win for Ecuador's Emelec over Colombia's Atletico Nacional in Libertadores round of 16 1st leg. Winner plays Tigres.
Interest in Fanendo Adi from Pachuca and Atlas according to one report 
@fmaldonado2009 Def. That's the main idea. Use it for when I got to games, chat to fans etc.
Massive congrats to mi compa @TomasGoubin on the publication of his book "Marcelo Bielsa, El Loco unchained." Buy: 
@joeltena Love the "Yay!!" at the end.
@ruizisoy I don't think Mayweather will want to fight Khan! Honestly believe Khan has best chance of anyone of beating him, due to his speed

@ESPNFCtri
This from yesterday: @TigresOficial's priority has to be the Copa Libertadores over Liga MX cc. @solotigres 
@49ersSFGiants89 Thanks! Good to get feedback.
Quality RT @miseleccionmx: Héctor G. Iñárritu y @MiguelHerreraDT visitaron @Disney Orlando 
Continuing the Snapchat experiment. Here's a video of me going up to the Omnilife this morn: 
@bertohernandez_ Nope. Thought about it, but Chepo is pretty shrewd. He'd just evade the question.
Decent interview with Chepo. Talked about Chivas this season, 2013, improving Mexican football, his future, Chicharito + Cubo's situation.
Off to Estadio Omnilife for an interview with Chepo. Will be posting a couple of vids on Snapchat: tommxfut
@JackPittBrooke haha, yep. Rochdale born and bred.
Already voted in the #ukelection2015. Should be very interesting to see who can form a coalition.
Angel Reyna and Carlos Salcido both back in full training for Chivas. Isaac Brizuela out for 2 weeks. I imagine Reyna replaces Brizuela.
US U-20s World Cup roster out. Congrats to @xolosofficial duo @PaulArriola and @_JR2_  
Good stuff from @nayibmoran, who spoke to @MiguelHerreraDT for The @MexSoccerShow in Houston (español) 
@BryanRMW @General_Troll69 @dchayet I think the players Mexico have would suit a 433 or 442, but like the identity the 532 has given team.
@dchayet not sure it's a case of "manning up" but id also like to see that formation/team.
Santos Laguna's Agustin Marchesin: This team has never lost its ambition for the Liguilla 
For these violent acts 
Here we go. The very pinnacle of the world game on display right now.

<MOBILE PHONE WITH RIGHTWARDS ARROW AT LE> iOS: 
<MOBILE PHONE WITH RIGHTWARDS ARROW AT LE> Android: 
@futgod Yeah. Just from what Herrera has been saying and how long Pulido has been out, I doubt he'll be taken into consideration.
@yosoymoii It's a strong argument. Problem is if Vela or Giovani get injured (as they have recently), then quality subs required.
And the Gold Cup one: 
Here is my prediction for Mexico's Copa America squad: 
@TFuentesOrtiz For example, Herrera said this morning that Rafa Marquez hadn't decided which squad he'd be in.
Prob along those lines, but will have to wait until Mon RT @TFuentesOrtiz: @mexicoworldcup is this real? 
@JuanG_Arango @DonTical_Futbol Very. Every day there is a new story. It promises to be a messy one.

<MOBILE PHONE WITH RIGHTWARDS ARROW AT LE> 
@JuanG_Arango @DonTical_Futbol No, but off the back of the Chivas deal, I'm sure there will be a knock-on effect when deals come up.
@DonTical_Futbol US TV deal for Chivas with Univision is already huge. 80 million dollars for 5 years was reported. 
@DonTical_Futbol Therefore wouldn't surprise me if Vergara was looking for an improved deal elsewhere.
@DonTical_Futbol Not heard anything, but think TV deals are going to go crazy in next few years, with Fox and ESPN opening things up.
@JerseyJonathan Personally, I'd have JDS as a starter now ahead of Gallito, but Herrera has tended to lean towards JDS in Copa America.
@JerseyJonathan It is a possibility and Jimenez/Peralta would be an exciting partnership.
Les tendré como van quedando las listas para @GoldCup y @CA2015 de @miseleccionmx 
@Cperez526 difficult to disagree with Ponchito. He'll be close if he can recover from that injury.
@vittorioemmanu2 quite possibly. Hopefully things turn out ok for Pulido.
@DanPriceMX  But with the Liga MX semis and Libertadores quarters the same week, Tigres will have to decide if they advance in league.
@elbos I think it'll be a young, exciting Copa America squad. Difficult job, but you never know …
@JaimeDali No. Cruz Azul and Chivas have reached the final. America a few semis.
Tigres through to the quarters, but that was a bit of a wake-up call. Will have to chose league or Libertadores very soon.
@erickd8a @ESPNFC Don't disagree with that. Seems like Herrera has played JDS along with the other Copa America players though. We'll see!
@OntiverosHector @miseleccionmx Yep, you're right. Can't imagine a call-up to the Copa America wouldn't at least tempt him though
@ElleMarq Will find out next Monday May 11. Could really be either tournament.
@KASKADE916 Not for Piojo 
Not suggesting I'd have Damian Alvarez involved this summer if it was my decision, but Herrera has mentioned Vuoso recently ...
@PedroLampert eu acho que nao mas jogando asi si deve estar cerca da selecao.
The way Damian Alvarez is playing this season, he can't be too far away from a Mexico call-up.
Bit of magic from Damian Alvarez to win Tigres a penalty … Sobis steps up and scores. Tigres 1-1 Universitario. 3-2 Tigres on aggregate.
Wouldn't be surprised if Tuca played reserves this weekend RT @jster9: @mexicoworldcup players are looking tired
Tigres on away goals rule. 2-2 on aggregate RT @TheMarkoPerez: @mexicoworldcup Who's Advancing With This Result?
Tigres making really hard work of this … just one goal away from going out.
My predictions for Mexico's Gold Cup 
@Gabriela_g_Ma Thanks!
Imagine Tuca Ferretti is going absolutely crazy at his Tigres team at halftime. Look tired out there. No spark. Tigres 0-1 Universitario.
@FatMigo301 It'll probably get published tomorrow morning. Will post it here though.
Here's my 1st Snapchat story. Very much an experiment, but can see how it could be v useful. Username: tommxfut 
@lorimar87 @cesarhfutbol haha cheers. Yeah really like it actually. I think Cesar is just getting used to it, like me!!
Not sure. Anyone? RT @christianhaaaaa: @mexicoworldcup what channel will the Tigres game be airing in US?
Gooool Universitario. The Bolivian side take the lead and catch Tigres cold in the 2nd minute. Tigres 0-1 Universitario.
@yosoymoii Cheers! Going to use it more when I go to games and stuff.
@MigueldiValle haha thanks! Not going to lie, quite like it, although going to keep in football-based.
Tuca Ferretti once again putting a strong team out in the Libertadores. Keep thinking he's going to shake things up ..
.@RicardoBSalinas @WhiteHouse Ask @BarackObama if he could talk @landondonovan out of retirement to play for Atlas for a year.
Salí en la foto del Chivas vs América!!! 
Haha 
Good first half. Frantic pace.
Been trying out Snapchat today: tommxfut. No idea what I'm doing, but giving it a go!
@jorgearangure @cesarhfutbol @MexSoccerShow ... and a personal apology.
cc. @cesarhfutbol RT @jorgearangure: @mexicoworldcup @MexSoccerShow Must have been an editing error in there. Don't see Bofo listed.
@svertelney I think today was the litmus test. He couldn't do much more to get a start than what he has over last few weeks.
@OleOleUnited I know. Just saying that when Benzema is back, there will be even less chance for Chicharito.
Most disappointing thing for Chicharito is that Benzema still isn't even in Real Madrid's squad.
Still time to watch the latest @MexSoccerShow before the Champions League gets underway 
So disappointing for him considering recent form RT @ESPNFCtri: Chicharito on the bench for Real Madrid v Juventus i
Racing coach Diego Cocca telling @Comotevaok there is interest from Atlas, but he's 100% focused on Racing at present.
@9Bernie_c No prob! Will do. looking forward to both UCL semis and then Tigres in Libertadores later on.
@Superb_Robek Exactly. Just so much desire at Atlas to win a trophy, it sometimes seems to spill over into nervousness.
@Superb_Robek What I like about @atlasfc's chances is that even the fans in Guadalajara aren't expecting anything.
Happy 5 de Mayo, Poblanos RT @PueblaFC: Hoy #5deMayo Celebremos el 153 Aniversario de la Batalla de Puebla  @…

@James_Fielden always at the cutting edge of these things me!
Decided to give @Snapchat a go. Username: tommxfut. Go easy on me though, don't know what I'm doing yet!
@Jorgaldana @ESPNFCtri @ESPNFC exactly. Really think this Clausura is open for anyone. Even teams like Monterrey or QTO if they make it.
@Jorgaldana @ESPNFCtri @ESPNFC Tell you something, Veracruz not an easy side to beat. Peñalba a beast and Furch could be good in liguilla
@erickd8a @jster9 @ESPNFCtri @ESPNFC @Cruz_Azul_FC jaja
@jherrera5 Thanks for the advice. Think I'll give Snapchat a try!
Another @MexSoccerShow with @WisoVazquez @soccermexicana @jonyrico and @cesarhfutbol in the bag. Good episode, too!  
The @MexSoccerShow live right now. Lots of talk on the message board. 
@jherrera5 Snapchat?
What's the deal with @Pinterest? Worth posting stories on there? Set one up, but not entirely convinced so far 
Who will win the @LIGABancomerMX 's title? Check this out 
With most of Europe's top leagues already done and dusted, Liga MX couldn't be much less predictable

What should Chicharito do at the end of the current season? ESPN's Tom Marshall explores the Mexico  
30,210 the average attendance in the Liga MX last weekend. Highest crowd was at Leones Negros: 49,500.
@aortizparamo Morelia really is in relegation trouble next season.
Morelia the main one. Puebla and Chivas, too RT @fasalinas_2096: @mexicoworldcup any new teams facing relegation troubles next season?
Copa America on May 11 RT @arod_91: @mexicoworldcup any idea when Piojo will announce the squads for the Copa America and Copa Oro?
@DonTical_Futbol Got a point, but difference for me has been Alustiza v Anongono. Puebla brought in a tried and tested Liga MX striker.
Puebla and Leones Negros battling against Liga MX relegation 
Thanks to @Sagastegui53 for pointing out Andres Muniz to me! Good follow in general, but especially for Tigres-related stuff.
Morelia's Californian striker @andresmuniz10 currently leading the Liga MX U-20 scoring charts. Previously trained for 6 months at Chelsea.
In-depth story on players from the United States coming down to Mexico to try and forge a career in  
Veracruz sitting at the top of the league with one round of games to go in the Clausura. Nobody would've predicted that at start of season.
@fifty_juan no. Leones Negros must win and Puebla must lose.
Not really sure how Leones Negros lost that match. Veracruz clinical in taking its chances.
Leones Negros 1-2 Veracruz. UDG needs to defeat Cruz Azul and hope Puebla lose to Santos Laguna. Only way UDG can remain in the Liga MX.
Unbelievable ending!
Goooool Veracruz. Emmanuel Garcia with it. Leones Negros 1-2 Veracruz.
No. Leones Negros would need a victory next week vs. Cruz Azul RT @CesarAvellan: @mexicoworldcup so if they tied do they go down?
Veracruz level the scores. Leones Negros have had chances to be a couple up. UDG 1-1 Veracruz.
Gooool Leones Negros. Huge mistake from Meliton Hernandez. UDG 1-0 Veracruz.
No. Would be reliant on Puebla not winning v Santos RT @yamcha_2013: @mexicoworldcup if leones negros doesn't win do they get relegated ?
The US Android version of the @LIGABancomerMX's official app 
Huge game for Leones Negros. Need four points over today's match vs. Veracruz and next week's against Cruz Azul.
Roque Santa Cruz scores for Cruz Azul. Won't score many easier. Pumas were dominating.   Pumas 0-1 Cruz Azul.
Anyone? RT @THEAndrewWinter: @mexicoworldcup Do you have recommendations for English language Liga MX, Copa Libertadores, soccer coverage?
Pumas vs. Cruz Azul. Another big game in a weekend of big games in the Liga MX. Both need a win to keep realistic playoff hopes alive.
@herculezg @DonTicallion @Cabrera_4L i think canelo had his opp. Im biased but, think @AmirKingKhan has the best chance v @FloydMayweather
Tigres march into Liga MX top spot after crucial Chivas victory 
Mexican @officiallydale fan. 
@herculezg @DonTicallion @Cabrera_4L your points score Herculez?
Sounds like what Montreal Impact tried to do but failed
@DonTicallion @Cabrera_4L yeah. Thought it was a good fight. Had it even after 8 rounds, then Mayweather pulled away.
Good fight. Had Mayweather ahead by a couple of rounds.
Mayweather vs. Pacquiao on delay in Mexico (at least it's free though!!). Chivas story sent, turning internet off. Enjoy the fight!
Some concerns for Chivas in that first half, but the reaction in the 2nd was very positive. Fair result.
Tigres 2-1 Chivas. Tigres move into 1st position, leap-frogging Chivas. Another good display from Tigres.
@_rwho Chaton has so much talent. Can't blame Chepo though. He has been very inconsistent in recent years.
Goooool Chaton. Nice header that. Comeback on for Chivas. Tigres 2-1 Chivas.
@zahidsalazar Yes, but he'll have to wait to complete five years in the country before he can play for the national team.
That's great 
Tigres hugely impressive that half. Chivas second best all over the field and unusually slack in defense. Tigres 2-0 Chivas.
Damian Alvarez once again with the assist for Tigres. He's having a great season.
What a lovely finish from Gerardo Lugo. Tigres 2-0 Chivas.
Yes. On loan from Pachuca RT @SoccerStuff340: @mexicoworldcup is Esqueda on loan with tigres?
Isaac Brizuela off injured. Former Monterrey striker Aldo de Nigris on to boos from Tigres fans. Bravo likely to move to the wing.
@allende05 Sure Herrera will be considering Esqueda. Not great options behind Chich, Vela, Gio and Jimenez.
Would like to see Raul Lopez further forward in his natural position at some point, even though he's done great at RB this season.
Time for De Nigris yet?
Yep. Players look in tune with each other and coach RT @RiosJose559: @mexicoworldcup Tigres hottest team in the league?
Chivas struggling these first 10 minutes. Need to get the ball off Tigres, who look full of confidence.
America also up against Tolulca. Pablo Aguilar with opener for CCL champion.
Goooool Tigres. Esqueda  continues his goal-scoring momentum. Tigres 1-0 Chivas.
@CenterRightTac Reports say he is injured. Make sense because he wasn't even on the bench.
Winner of Tigres vs. Chivas moves into first place in the Liga MX. A draw and Atlas stays in 1st.
Tigres going with a full strength team. Thought Tuca may rest one or two players.
First change in Chivas' starting XI in 5 Liga MX matches. Fernando Arce replaces the injured Carlos Salcido.
Puebla 2-0 Leon. Advantage La Franja in the relegation battle. Leones Negros need at least a draw tomorrow vs. Veracruz.
Puebla up 2-0. Alustiza once again.
Mayweather on points. Not the most exciting prediction! You? 
Poor decision from the ref.  
Puebla did give away free tickets for this game 
Puebla looking to put pressure on Leones Negros. A win v Leon here would be huge. A loss combined with a UDG win tomrrw and Puebla is down.
@konde_el Nope. But a nice positive story at the end of a negative day for city. Simple as that.
Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice in 2 mins. Chicharito with the assist for the second.
After a dark day for Guadalajara with the narco-blockades, Atlas finish Friday top of the Liga MX, with Chivas in 2nd.
Ugly scenes on the final whistle.
Tijuana's slide continues, @atlasfc move to 1st in the @LIGABancomerMX and a place in the postseason.
Would Atlas be the first team to guarantee a liguilla spot with a win? Not got the table handy.
@juangrimaldo79 @vine unbelievable from Castillo. He's been great.
One of the best goals of the season? 
What a goal. Ridiculous from Atlas. Edgar Castillo drove forward, passed to Alvarez and Caballero with a top finish. Tijuana 1-2 Atlas.
Greg Garza goal 
Greg Garza with the opener for Xolos. Rare goal for the US international left back. Xolos 1-0 Atlas.
At a bar watching Xolos v Atlas. Good to see a few people out despite the havoc caused by the narco-blockades earlier today in Guadalajara.
Ronaldinho steps up ...  and scores for Queretaro. Morelia 0-1 Queretaro.
Ronaldinho to take Queretaro's penalty...
#dinhotime
@soccercanales Not ideal, but that ownership group isnt sort of cash!
@osanto85 @razadeportiva think it would be  a really bad PR move for MLS to sign Ronaldinho after he fails in Mexico.
Can't imagine Ronaldinho will be sticking around long at a team he doesn't even get to start for 
5 players born in the US started for Xolos' U-20s today 
Chivas look to lock down Clausura playoff spot against Tigres 
Carlos Vela's goal:  
He's back. Carlos Vela scores of a free kick.

.@Chivas due to travel to the airport in Guadalajara now. Might have problems in getting there due to the blockades all around the city.
Good to see "Gringo" Torres back kicking the ball around at Tigres training - via @mediotiempo_nte
@thewfranco Probably didn't word it quite right!
@thewfranco really good. Timely tweet. Shows he's interested and still connected with GDL. In my opinion, at least!
Was discussing Chicharito's popularity in Mexico on The @MexSoccerShow the other day. It's down to stuff like this: 
What a legend @CH14_ is. Narco-blockades in his home city Guadalajara and he tweets a photo promoting a peace march 
3 years then @atlasfc!! RT @ESPNFCtri: Andre Guardado has put pen to paper on his new three-year contract at @PSV 
@ThisCharmingEgg Thanks. It is sad. Just went to the park, everything normal. Public holiday today as well in Mexico.
.@FiscaliaJal advising people not to go out unless it is necessary. A number of narco-blockades around Guadalajara today. Sad times.
very sad RT @jhernandez83: Código Rojo en mi hermosa Guadalajara :(
@benjijoya54 @ClubSantosEn jaja Benji "Ferguson" Joya! All good here, thanks. Hope you are well. Speak soon!

@CalWilliamsComm Thanks Callum!
US U-23 and @ClubSantosEn mid @benjijoya54 starting his coaching career early at the  Copa Santos Peñoles tourney! 

@MexicoWorldCup details his most realistic options: 
Chicharito on @ellarguero: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world. He's an example for us in training. He always wants more.
Chicharito on @ellarguero: The buyout clause that Real Madrid would have to pay to keep me? That's between the directors and my agent.
Chicharito on @ellarguero: I think I would come in third if you put me in a race with Ronaldo and Bale.

For all your Bielsa needs (in French), @TomasGoubin will have a book published on El Loco next month.
.@askomartin reporting that Marcelo Bielsa was in London talking to West Ham, but that the club wouldn't meet his requests on football side.
@EricGomez86 @soccercanales @cboehm On a minuscule level. Talking like five non-Mexican US players in Liga MX youth systems?
@EricGomez86 @soccercanales @cboehm Again, that would be limited.  Mexican clubs unlikely to bring non-Mexican citizens down en masse.
@EricGomez86 @soccercanales @cboehm Will be limited while only two foreigners are allowed in Liga MX U-20s teams and zero in U-17s.
@soccercanales @cboehm I think it will be limited as long as only two foreigners are allowed in Liga MX U-20s teams and zero in U-17s.
@AveAzulcrema Wouldn't surprise me. Get Sat out the way, players can rest for a few days, then should be the playoffs.
Liga MX as a minimum could've moved America's game this Sat to the Sun. Can't think that it would be a huge upheaval.
Club America in action again on Sat. Have to say that the Liga MX - for all the banter on social networks - has done v little to help Ame.

Read TL RT @12thLady: So much to share about my LigaMX fan/stadium attendee experience. Gaaahhhh. Where to begin?!??
  
Great interview with Darwin Quintero. Honest, emphasized how different life is in DF at America than with Santos Laguna.
Darwin Quintero on move to America: I was a reference in Santos Laguna. Here they've won a lot of things. I start from zero. It's different.
Darwin Quintero: I'm conscious that I'm not at my best. But when you come to a new team, with new teammates, it takes time.

Nosotros nos vamos al #MundialDeClubes <REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER J + REG>
Gustavo Matosas: Montreal played tactically the same in both halves. What America changed was getting the final pass right.
Gustavo Matosas: I want to congratulate Montreal Impact, which is a good team, with good players and good coach.
@soccercanales There's a guy called Piatti who doesn't look too bad.
@Mendoza1011 @Varo_386 @LIGABancomerMX @MLS That is controversial!
@dwyercd @LIGABancomerMX @MLS Yep. Didn't mean it as major controversy. Should've used a different word.
@allende05 @LIGABancomerMX @MLS Nope. All in good spirit.
@darthtwiggy1 @LIGABancomerMX @MLS It's all good fun on both sides, adds to the rivalry ..
Oribe Peralta: The 2nd half was amazing, like all of us were enjoying ourselves.
Controversial RT @LIGABancomerMX:  @MLS will have vacations in December … once again 

We're going to the Club World Cup <REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER J + REG>
Rubens Sambueza: This win gives us the possibility to go to the Club World Cup, which all of us wanted.
The mini-golden era in Club America's history continues. Four finals and three major trophies in the last couple of years.
Dario Benedetto: We've given a lot in the last two weeks and the sacrifice has been worth the effort.
Montreal Impact did everything right in the CCL this year, except for the last 45 minutes on the final.
Huge for Gustavo Matosas. So much pressure on this game. Could be turning point for him.
Club America will represent CONCACAF in the Club World Cup in Japan this December.
Last 10 winners of CONCACAF’s regional club tournament have now come from the @LigaBancomerMX.
Club America win the CONCACAF Champions League for the 6th time, equaling Cruz Azul as the tournament’s most successful team.
Montreal Impact 2-4 Club America. Las Aguilas win the CCL 5-3 on aggregate. Congrats, @CF_America.
Class from Piatti.
Oribe Peralta lapping it up, as he should. Two vital goals in this final, despite injury concerns.
Fair play to Darwin Quintero. Not good at all in the 1st half, turned it around in the 2nd.
What a turn and finish that was from Benedetto. America running away with it. Montreal 1-4 America.

And another for America! Bendetto nets the third.
CC. @TomasGoubin RT @Julionumber9: @mexicoworldcup how do I say si se puede impact in French? #ChivasFan #Salty
@herculezg It was like you said last game … Jesus Molina.
Goooool America. Oribe Peralta. Montreal needs two.
Good spell this for America. Still don't trust the defense, which makes for an exciting last 30.
Not as I understand it 
Top game this now. America know one more goal will likely do it.
All square now. One more goal for America and Montreal will need to score twice. Matosas driving his team forward on the sideline.
Goooool America. Lovely finish from Benedetto. Montreal 1-1 America.
America has also played two Liga MX games since Montreal last played in MLS. Not ideal for Las Aguilas.
America's fitness comes into play this 2nd half. Peralta, Sambueza and Aguilar all carried knocks into the game.
@Crockster123 No worries. Still got your Jaffa Cakes here! Been meaning to visit Chapala for weeks!
@HugoR_17 jaja. That would be fun.
@ElNaranja22 Not at all. America knows how big a game this is and how strong Montreal is at the back.
Would like to see Cristian Pellerano on for America. Former Xolos player who has plenty of experience on artificial turf.
Superb 1st half from Montreal. Once again carrying out a game plan to perfection. Frustrating America, dangerous on the break.
Darwin Quintero just doesn't look like he is enjoying himself out there. It was the same on Sunday.
@Crockster123 Away goals count. 1-1 goes to extra time and pens.
America the same frustrating shell of a team it has been in recent weeks. Promises a lot, failing to deliver. 45 mins to get it right.
America players need to keep their heads here. Osvaldo should know better than that. Still a long way to go. No need for Ame to panic.
Good game this now! End to end.
Incredible.

@Georgioossoo yes.
Goooool Montreal. Romero with it. America defense all over the place. Montreal 1-0 America. 2-1 up on aggregate now.
Give @olitremblay for all things Montreal. Great job covering the CCL final so far.
Would be huge for America coach Gustavo Matosas to lift the trophy. Under pressure.
Seem to be writing this quite a lot in recent weeks, but this is another big game for America's Ventura Alvarado.
Liga MX is confident RT @LIGABancomerMX: Hoy ganamos.
No idea what to predict. Could make the argument America will win 4-0, although 2 wins in last 8 suggests it won’t be so simple.
12 of last 14 CCL finalists have been Mexican. Last 9 winners of tournament have been from Liga MX. Can Montreal break Mexico’s hold on CCL?
America firm favorite with the bookmakers 
A place at the Club World Cup in Japan between Dec. 10-20 at stake in the CCL final. Host country was announced a few days ago.
Mexico federation president Justino Compean on TV: We're not the giant of CONCACAF. The gap has been cut.
Liga MX teams have won the #CCL on 30 occasions, with Costa Rica's six the next best. America bidding for number 31 tonight.
Montreal has only won 1 of 5 games in the CCL knockout rounds so far. Might not have to tonight if they get a 0-0 or 1-1 draw.
Quintero and Benedetto must link up better for America. Not great body language or chemistry between the pair last Sunday in the clasico.
Club America ‘keeper Moises Munoz last week: "I can't imagine another game in which Montreal have so much luck and we waste so many chances"
Can’t argue the CCL rivals the UCL or Libertadores for quality, but 150,000 attending the final over the 2 games isn’t at all bad.
Important boost for America that Sambueza and Peralta start.Sambueza the heartbeat of this America team, Peralta the most consistent forward
Strong America XI vs. Montreal: Muñoz, Aguilar, Alvarado, Aguilar, Samudio, Guerrero, Martínez, Sambueza, Quintero, Peralta, Benedetto.
America coming into the CCL final 2nd leg with 1 win in last 5. Montreal has just one victory in its last 15 games in all competitions.
Via @apunte1916: @CF_America's game in Montreal is the furthest north the club has played in its history, surpassing Chicago.
.@Jonatan_Pena reporting Rubens Sambueza will start and captain America. (He's also a great follow for Spanish speakers)
In last two CCLs, the record between Liga MX and MLS teams is two wins each and five ties. Tonight looks like being the decider.
@danielljara I don't think so. Actually really interesting to see the difference in opinions of fans.
Worth remembering that America - whose fans use the slogan "Hate me more" - is the most unpopular Liga MX side, according to polls.
Judging from the response to last tweet, it would seem a small majority of Liga MX fans want to see America lose. 
@PedroUnplugged @elitepromogroup No way it would happen. Definitely not fans from the local area. It'd be treason.
Chivas/Pumas/fans of other Liga MX teams going for Club America or Montreal tonight?
@Julionumber9 8 pm Eastern, 7 p.m. in Mexico, 5 p.m. PST.
A look at Montreal vs. America from the historical MLS vs. Liga MX perspective: 
@PBJwill jaja
It's not a goal, but that was a nice assist from Chicharito.
@Reydorosco2 There will be pressure to do so, especially if @MLS is prepared to help out their teams.


#ElBaileDelJefe
.@atlasfc making light of Boy's little dance last Sat by inviting fans to win TJ trip by sending a vid of themselves doing #ElBaileDelJefe
@nayibmoran @orbelin90 Interesting to see he isn't allow to give interviews at the moment, on the orders of the directors and coaching staff

#JuntosPorElMundialDeClubes 
@joeltena Pretty sure it was Conmebol helping Tigres out and Universitario kindly agreed.

Live chat with @LindbergESPN: 
Chicharito's mission today continues to be to make it as difficult as possible for  @MrAncelotti to pick Benzema over him when he is fit.
@vittorioemmanu2 Maybe Goal 4 can just be a documentary of Chicharito in his year at LA Galaxy and then retirement season with Chivas.
@juangrimaldo79 @jhernandez83 jaja not even Chuy was allowed in!
On a personal level, no press being allowed into Chivas means my interview with Chepo is postponed. Was really looking forward to it!
Situation at Chivas obviously to do with the Angelica Fuentes-Jorge Vergara split. Looks set to be messy as both seek an adequate settlement
Bit of a tense situation up at Chivas. No media or fans allowed in due to a request from Omnilife-Chivas' legal team.
Away leg win over Universitario de Sucre sets Tigres up well in the Copa Libertadores 
Early night tonight. Interview with Chepo tomorrow morning. Then there is the small matter of the CCL final … Should be a fun day.
CAS update on Alan Pulido case below. No decision as yet, but Pulido is claiming that Tigres forged his signature 
@ChrisV323 I actually thought there were 2 red cards for America players in the 1st leg vs. Montreal. Others would disagree.

Copa Libertadores #RT
Liga MX #FAV

Participen aficionados fel…
@OldScar7 Really? Would you say majority of Tigres fans prefer Libertadores success over Liga MX? What you think Tuca would do?
@ExclusiveFUT Liga MX usually prioritizes the domestic tournament.
Problem for Tigres could come if they make the semifinal of the liguilla. Games are scheduled for same time as Libertadores quarters.
@dxg009 Will be interesting to see what Tuca does. Sure he will rest players against Chivas and/or Universitario in 2nd leg.
@Jalex23 Whether it is wise to bring it up and for his players to read it is a different issue …
@Jalex23 100% valid. Club America's schedule hands an important advantage to Montreal, no doubt.
Huge win for Tigres in Bolivia. Mature, solid team that can manage games and isn't easily fazed. Good recipe for Libertadores success.
America's Paul Aguilar also coming into the CCL final carrying an injury, according to reports.
Matosas not happy with the Liga MX for not rearranging matches: "Give your country a helping hand," his message (Spa) 


@I_Resendis Tigres started slowly but now look much better than Universitario. Wouldn't be a surprise if they scored again.
Gooool Tigres. Damian Alvarez finishes. Universitario 1-2 Tigres.

Interesting now to see what Tuca Ferretti does. A 2nd goal would be huge and Tigres on top, but Tuca would take a 1-1 right now.
That was the first goal at home Universitario de Sucre had conceded in the Libertadores, not in the whole tournament.
Goool Tigres. The first Universitario de Sucre has conceded this season in the Libertadores. Esqueda with it. Universitario 1-1 Tigres.
@emilionavarrojr Massive game for Las Aguilas. Will be fascinating.
@Showtime48 It's on Fox Deportes in Mexico.
Big 45 mins coming up for Tigres. A 1-1 draw would be a great result in Bolivia. Looked like they were conserving energy that 1st half.
@andrew_wiebe Thanks, Andrew!
@VillasArmy Yep. Watching the Tigres game at same time. My mistake!
@samy_guapo83 America's secret weapon!
@soccermexicana haha
Gustavo Matosas confirming Rubens Sambueza is a doubt for CCL final, but Oribe Peralta is likely to start (Spanish) 

2nd min. Universitario de Sucre up against Tigres. Bad start for the Liga MX side. Universitario 1-0 Tigres.
@DURMgunner I think it might even be good for the Mexican game, so it doesn't take things for granted.
@ElNaranja22 Thanks, Kyle. Much appreciated!
Universitario de Sucre yet to concede a goal at home in the Libertadores so far. Think Sobis or Guerron will alter that stat tonight.
Interesting to read @Tim_Vickery's thoughts on Tigres' Libertadores challenge 
A few thoughts on the wider context of CCL final - Club America seeking to uphold Liga MX's CCL domination over MLS

Just went on @ExtraTimeRadio. Honestly, there is no better time  to face Club America. Tired players, injuries, rumors of problems in camp..
@TaylorTwellman @impactmontreal  Not sure about MLS, but it would certainly make the @LIGABancomerMX sit up and take notice.
@DonTical_Futbol Wouldn't surprise me if they moved Jaguares to Puebla and sold Chiapas to someone/somewhere else. Nothing wud surprise me.
@DonTical_Futbol Think it is 2017. Puebla owner was basically saying the other day that he and Chiapas brother will merge at some point
@DonTical_Futbol Problem with Dorados is the they are owned by Xolos … anyone's guess as to how that would go down.
@DonTical_Futbol Necaxa.
Final of the Ascenso MX set: Dorados de Sinaloa vs. San Luis - May 2 in Culiacan, May 9 in San Luis.
@bmvaughn Not at most clubs. It is the case with Puebla and Chiapas.
Puebla giving away free tickets for game vs. Leon this weekend as club bids to avoid relegation.
My take on yesterday's Super Clasico from the Chivas perspective: 
11,260 at the Estadio Azul for Cruz Azul vs. Chiapas. Embarrassing that for one of Mexico's "big four."
25,418 the average attendance last weekend in the Liga MX.

(Official slogan)
Got a good explanation today of how snapchat works. Strongly considering using it. 
@Cabrera_4L It is the truth. The America players look tired. CCL victory is the boost they need.
@12thLady No worries. Good to meet you. Enjoy Zacatecas!
It's true America's club has been hectic, but if the club is to have success this season, that isn't going to change.
If you're an America fan, it wasn't great to hear Matosas talking about his squad's tiredness and amount of matches tonight post game.
Chepo: We've not lost at home. We made that an objective. The fans are important and we thank them.
Chepo not giving much away in his post match press conference.
Chivas coach Chepo: Hard fought game. America changed.  That is part of the respect they showed.
Matosas hinting there that he doesn't have the right players at present to play the kind of game he would like.
Club America coach Matosas: If you ask me if I'm satisfied, then no. We have quality players to give more.
Club America coach Matosas: It would've been great for the players to have an extra day rest (for Montreal game), but it is what it is.
Club America coach Matosas: My philosophy never changes, but sometimes the coach has to  alter plans depending on their players.
Club America coach Matosas: The defense was very good. Pablo and Ventura were solid.
Club America coach Matosas:  This clasico came in between two important finals. It would've been ideal to move the game.
Club America coach Matosas claiming the only player held back for Wed vs. Montreal was Oribe Peralta.
Club America coach Matosas: I think it was a just result. It was an even game.
Matosas due out to talk to the press very soon ...
Not the best clasico. A draw suits both teams. Chivas top of the league. Fans can't complain about that.
Very strange. Arroyo bursting down the wing and only Benedetto in the penalty area waiting for a cross.
Oribe Peralta obviously being saved for Wednesday vs. Montreal.
Been poor this second half from America. Really missed Sambueza to get things going in midfield.
@JoelyAceves Nope. He's not on the bench.
Big 25 mins in America's season this.

Stadium rocking now. "Dale rebano," the chant going around.
Lovely finish from De Nigris. Game on now. Chivas forced to attack given the subs made.
Would be a massive blow if Sambueza isn't available for America on Wed vs. Montreal. The heartbeat of the team.
jaja RT @momex21: Ricardo La Volpe still working in Guadalajara @mexicoworldcup 
Ventura Alvarado has moved over to left back for America. Versatility a major plus of his game.
Chivas back out early for the 2nd half.
Have to say I read this game all wrong. Thought America would shade possession and Chivas  play on counter. It's the other way round.
Aldo de Nigris for Carlos Fierro has to be an option as well. Either alongside Bravo, or shifting Bravo to the wing.
I'd get Fernando Arce in for Carlos Salcido. He hasn't looked confident since getting injured and it seemed to affect Chivas.
Game set up perfectly for Club America in the 2nd half. There will be spaces as Chivas search for the equalizer.
Paul Aguilar's celebration based off some banda group from his home state of Sinaloa. Forget the name of them.

Paul Aguilar golazo: 
What a goal. Won't see many better than that anywhere in the world this weekend.
Referee already under some pressure. No idea how Salcido is still on. Chivas 0-0 America after 10 mins.
Not great pictures there of Salcido's ankle bending back. Chaton warming up.
@joshuasomething @_dosuno @thestraygoat k pex? jaja
Changing my fan % to 70-30 in favor of Chivas after the teams were read out.
I feel Chivas have to keep cool, solid and wait for America to make mistake. Initial urge will be to come out flying. IMO would hurt them.
@soccercanales Mariachi made way for DJ haha.
Atmosphere building in the Omnilife. Wish they'd turn the tunes off though and let the fans  provide the noise.
@James_Fielden Yeah. That's where the official America supports are, basically the barra brava. They are separated from Chivas fans.
@James_Fielden Couple of thousand, but the crowd is mixed. Lots of couples where one has America shirt, the other Chivas.
@ChopGod_10 @betoxchiva @Chivas I don't think there is any way he'll be allowed to leave. One injury and he is the back-up striker.
America fans: What are your thoughts on Gustavo Matosas’ reign so far? Should he be given more time?
Would Chivas fans still prefer Cubo to start over Bravo, Rodriguez over Michel, or are most now in agreement with Chepo?
.@betoxchiva @ChopGod_10 @Chivas Asked Cubo about it on Thurs and he said he'll join Houston "when Chivas' season ends."
Give @ESPNFCtri a follow for the Clasico Nacional. Will be tweeting a few things from there.
@MundialMexico1 Yes.
@StevensBoudreau Just the porras or barras bravas. The rest of the stadium is mixed.
Cubo Torres hasn't made the bench for Chivas in what will be his last classic nacional in a while.
Certainly seems like America is resting some players for the CCL on Wed. Pellerano, Peralta, Goltz all on bench. Matosas playing with fire.
America out to warm-up. Majority booing. Would say it is 60-40 Chivas fans at present in the Omnilife.
@GlancingHdr Could field an All-Star team in the CCL each year.
Chivas players out to warm-up in the Omnilife. Mariachis playing the song "Guadalajara, Guadalajara."
Another massive game for Club America's Ventura Alvarado. Coming thick and fast for him at the moment.
So no Oribe Peralta in America's starting XI.
Chivas XI: Michel, Lopez, Pereira, Salcedo, Ponce, Castro, Salcido, Fabian, Brizuela, Fierro, Bravo.
@soccercanales Must be better than whoever they were thinking of playing, or they wouldn't be considering it. If it's in the rules ...
Marriage proposal on the Estadio Omnilife pitch. Answer is a yes. Cue applause.

Chicharito's two goals a good omen for Chivas? Sure @CH14_  will be watching the #ClasicoNacional at home in Madrid.
Chicharito's second RT @DonJimnz: @mexicoworldcup here's the 2nd! He's looking good! 
Tickets for Chivas vs. America sold out last Wednesday. Going outside the Estadio Omnilife today for $150 dollars and up.
Quality RT @BirdyMarquez: @mexicoworldcup in case you missed Chicharito's gol! 
@BirdyMarquez Thanks!
@rodmacneil If it is an exact tie it would be on goal difference.

Arrived at the Estadio Omnilife earlier than expected. Heavy security outside, as was announced. Should be a good one!
Club America fans confident? Seems like a lot of the build-up has been centered around Chivas' revival.
@scartissue19 people here always say it highlights irregularidad, but I just think it shows there isn't much between the teams.
.@TheEagleInsight and @thestraygoat good accounts for different perspectives on today's clasico.
Send pics! RT @ESPNFCtri: .@MexicoWorldCup will be at the #superclasico today in Guadalajara for @ESPNFC. What are your predictions? Why?

Tomas Boy's jig. Quality. RT @juangrimaldo79: @mexicoworldcup "El Baile"

Atlas 3-2 Leon. Amazing comeback from Los Zorros with 10 players. Leon continues to struggle.
@inkedASVPAR jaja
@ReedMunir I agree with what @DonTical_Futbol was saying earlier: Cruz Azul need a shake-up.
For those mentioning Cocca and Atlas, I'd advise subscribing to @futboltactico and reading this (Spanish):   
@mark_arthur Talking to people in GDL, I don't think it was. I know that seems strange. I'd bet La Volpe will be back in Liga MX next season
@jonyrico @EricGomez86 Yeah I was only messing with Alustiza. Not convinced about Pellerano on his own as a DM. Guemez would be perfect.
@EricGomez86 @jonyrico I've heard that Jesus Molina guy at Santos Laguna isn't too bad.
@chinox15_ Would love it. Cocca's won a lot of plaudits for his work at Racing.
@jonyrico Alustiza can play contencion to give Matosas' team a more attacking edge.
Call me crazy, but with Vuce and Mohamed now in work, Atlas could do worse than have a chat with La Volpe if Boy gets fired.
Jurgen Damm off in the 71st. Not a great night for the young winger.
@deportesmex Believe so. Received a really poor tackle midweek in the Libertadores.
@frenteria100 @tuamimlp @LIGABancomerMX I'd personally like to open up pro/rel more and have two really strong leagues, with more movement.
@I_Resendis It's done to encourage people to go to the stadium, but I mean a lot watch on streams or at bars.
@darthtwiggy1 You can buy it on PPV. I think it is about $18.
@DonTical_Futbol Not worked out the numbers, but Morelia in trouble. Puebla, UDG, Chivas, Pumas, Veracruz all around there as well.
@FutIncorrecto Yes. Coming up to 7 years here now!
Pachuca goal wrongly disallowed. One of those where the decision is completely understandably, but a quick video replay would clear it up.
@tuamimlp Scary thing is it would be no surprise! Precedent already set and Liga MX said is was all good.
@AreheartJohn Chivas better off, for sure. But their last good season in 2012 also gets discounted.
Pachuca equalizer. Puebla's Romero slices it into his own net. Best player on the field 1st half. Pachuca 1-1 Puebla.
Leon already up vs. Atlas. Not at the Jalisco tonight. Can't watch, either. Local games never shown live in GDL for Chivas or Atlas.
@dxg009 @AscensoMX @AtleticoSLfc Congrats! Justice if San Luis go up.
¡Todo listo en el Estadio Jalisco para el Atlas vs. @clubleonfc !
#SoyFiel
@AreheartJohn That's right. Means Chivas will begin next season in the relegation battle once again.
Really interesting interview with Puebla owner @jesuslopezch on Fox ahead of Pachuca game. Says there is a "Plan B" if Puebla go down.
@DonTical_Futbol Just not clicking at the moment. Beef between team and the barra not helping anyone either.

Haha good old David Moyes. Said yesterday that Vela isn't fit to start and then puts him in from the beginning vs. Villarreal.

Going to do The @MexSoccerShow Clasico preview after Queretaro vs. Tigres ends. It'll be live here: 
Tuca's sub taking off Arevalo, putting on Briseno and moving to a back 5 has smothered Queretaro. Had looked good for equalizer.
@I_Resendis I'm a big fan, although he certainly isn't to everyone's taste.
Well worth checking out Santos Laguna's English-language twitter ahead of match vs. Leones Negros: @ClubSantosEn
Two quality saves from Nahuel Guzman, or this could now be 3-3.
@mina_awesome1 No worries. Good luck in the game!
@mina_awesome1 7:30 p.m. ET. Guessing 6:30 Central?
@jster9 Hoping they can do something in the Copa Libertadores. Decent draw for them vs. Universitario de Sucre.
Gooool Queretaro. One down, two to go. Youngster Kevin Gutierrez with it. Good work from Pineda and Sinha. Gallos Blancos 1-3 Tigres.
@jster9 Ahh. Fair enough. Looking good tonight and pretty much all season!
Guessing you're a Chivas fan, Jimmy? 
And another for Tigres. Gallos Blancos all over the place at the back. Queretaro 0-3 Tigres.
Well worked goal from Tigres. Guerron heads in. Poor defending from Gallos Blancos. Guerron completely unmarked. Queretaro 0-2 Tigres.


Not bad that from Damian Alvarez.
Watch out for Queretaro's Orbelin Pineda v Tigres. Just turned 19, scored 3 in last 3 from MF and has started all 15 games this season.
Ronaldinho on the bench for Queretaro, despite his 2 goals last weekend. Vucetich laying down the law.

Off to first session of @futfitmx now. A sufrir!
Miguel Ponce on his El Tri situ: I’ve not been in a call-up this year, but I’ve got faith that I can be in the Gold Cup or Copa America.
Carlos Salcedo on this summer: I’m focused on the Pan Am Games … but if it’s the Copa America or Gold Cup, I’ll take it. Whatever he needs.
@texican11 @Chivas @CF_America @EPN haha even by Mexican standards that would be crazy!
.@Chivas and @CF_America have made a bet on Twitter. Loser of clasico pays for an entire family to go to the Copa America in Chile.
The average attendance for @LIGABancomerMX games has been almost exactly 30,000 this Clausura 2015, according to league data.
Buzz around Chivas at the minute. A few hundred fans outside the stadium today apparently wanting clasico tixs. Some scuffles with police.
.@erickestefano15 (Cubo) saying he has been watching @HoustonDynamo games from Guadalajara and is keeping up with developments at club.
Carlos Salcedo also saying he's not getting carried away with national team debut and is focused on the U-23s.
@Neymismo I've spoke  to him before in English. It's not bad.
Got some decent stuff from Cubo regarding Houston. He is currently taking English classes in GDL.
Asked Miguel Ponce if he'd do an interview in English. Reply: "Estamos en Mexico, en espanol." Jaja
@Javier06flores yes. Starts 11 am at omnilife. Press/fans allowed in at 12.15.
Waiting for Chivas to open the doors to the Omnilife for media day. 
Tickets for the clasico nacional going for 150 USD upstairs and 270 USD on the lower level on black market. people buying outside Omnilife.

@jonyrico Suerte mi buen Jonny!
Chivas forward Rafa Marquez Lugo has retired following a losing battle to get his knee right after surgery last year.
@margaritolol True. Damm just about misses out though due to his age. He was born in Nov '92.
@stiglitzmx Yep. Forgot about him.
"Mexico connected pretty passes and looked like the better team, but didn't push too hard for a goal"- @soccercanales 
Poor from Mexico's U-22 last night vs. US. Established regulars Cubo, Raul Lopez, Abella, Pizarro, Salcedo,  Gutierrez etc missing though.

Gustavo Matosas much more measured than his players in his post game press conference. Giving Montreal credit, saying they are a tough team.
@JasonSaghini Not that I heard.
Estan pasando el partido de Sub-22 de Mexico contra EEUU por @futbolporsky en Mexico?
Fighting talk from Club America's players. Creates a real edge (as if any more was required) for the 2nd leg.
Moises Munoz on Montreal: A team that sits back like that and defends doesn't deserve to be champion.
Moises Munoz on TV: We definitely deserved more. We had enough chances to score 5 or 6. I don't think they'll have the same luck in Canada.
Oribe Peralta on TV: If we play like we did in the 2nd half, it's likely that we'll get the result there (in Montreal).
@GalindoPW America the best team in Concacaf on paper, for me, but that doesn't win games! I'd still back them as impressive as MTL has been
Follow @soccercanales and @DonTical_Futbol for updates from the stadium for USA vs. Mexico U-23s.
Me too RT @fifty_juan: @mexicoworldcup we can expect a great game for the second leg
@martineztri2014 yes
I'd put Club America as favorite. Think playing away might suit them a little more. Need more from Benedetto/Quintero though.
@herculezg Great reading your comments before and during the game!
Club America favorite for the trophy after the 1-1 draw?
Club America 1-1 Montreal. Excellent result in the end for Montreal. Somehow held on to draw in that 2nd half.
Gooool America. Oribe Peralta with it. America 1-1 Montreal.
@James_Fielden It is strange. Touts/Scalpers, maybe.
Chivas just confirmed that tickets for Sunday's Clasico Nacional vs. Club America have sold out.
@shinguardian To be fair to America's defenders (who I agree haven't been great), they have been left almost completely exposed.
@MLSAnalyst @Benrmzspencer A real lack of discipline and balance in the team.
@MLSAnalyst Similar to the Herediano game away. Don't think it is lack of respect. America just not clicking.
Could've been red for Pimentel as well. It was definitely a yellow. Don't think he meant it, but got the timing all wrong.
Oribe Peralta on for Oswaldo Martinez. Lots of attacking players on for America now.
I'd get Oribe Peralta on at halftime (depending on how fit he actually is) for Arroyo. Give the crowd and team a lift.
Lucky boy there Martinez.
This game reminds me a bit of Matosas' Leon vs. Bolivar in the Copa Libertadores last season.
Tigres vs. Universitario de Sucre (Bolivia) in the Libertadores Round of 16. Winnable, but still a tough trip.
@kookylara Yep. Still going for it. Worried Montreal will score again though.
Yes  
Gooool Montreal!! 16th minute. Piatti gets it and unveils his, "Grandfather, I love you," T-shirt. America 0-1 Montreal.
@GolazodelGringo jaja
@herculezg I thought America looked more at ease and balanced when Matosas played 3 center backs earlier in the season.
@FreeGlass @herculezg Jaja that was totally my fault. I changed it and am so used to using MTY for Los Rayados
Away goals rule does count RT @elitepromogroup: @mexicoworldcup is there an away goal rule in the Finals?
@ArnoldcommaJon jaja that's crazy. Said the same on The @mexsoccershow! Looking forward to this for that very reason.
Sticking with my 3-1 to America prediction. Can see Montreal scoring at least once.
90,000-plus for @TheChampions 1st leg in Mexico City, 60,000-plus in Montreal for the return. Not bad, eh?
Anyone? RT @Escojar: @mexicoworldcup Do you know how many Montreal Impact made the journey? Or is it only America fans in the stadium?
@ArnoldcommaJon Honestly haven't. Is that what you wrote? Great minds … or something like that jaja
Gustavo Matosas' job likely on the line if Club America don't win @TheChampions. Was backed by huge $ preseason. Results expected.
America a real Jekyll and Hyde team at the minute. Have lost 4-0 twice and 3-0 once over last six matches.
Montreal Impact looking to become the 1st non-Mexican team to win @TheChampions since the new format of tournament began in 2008-09.
Oribe Peralta on the bench for America. Still recovering from injury. Best not to rush him with the Clasico on Sun and CCL 2nd leg next week

His five greatest moments, from @MexicoWorldCup: 
Chicharito "Lindo y Querido," say Marca 
Club America vs. Montreal Impact at the top of the hour. Which America will show up? Can Montreal curb Las Aguilas' attack?
Atlas' Libertadores journey is over. More shocking defending. Santa Fe 2-0 Atlas.
Ponchito Gonzalez taken off with an injury. Nasty tackle. Worrying for the young Mexico international. He was looking good in the center.
Typical Atlas this season in the Libertadores. Played really well, created chances, been the better team … lose concentration at the back.
Watching the replay of that tackle on Ponchito, it was a definite yellow and possibly a red card.
As always, for anything related to Colombian football, give @cworswick a follow.
@ocabrera11 @cworswick Cheap flights down to Bogota. I was even considering going!
Hoping @atlasfc pull off a minor miracle here. Want more Libertadores in Guadalajara!

Carrick RT @carras16: Not surprised...
 @CH14_ 
So pleased for you mate <THUMBS UP SIGN>🏼<CLAPPING HANDS SIGN>🏼
@Elowkid @CH14_ Don't understand it. If you can't celebrate scoring the winner in a Champions League quarter in the Bernabeu ...
@SoccerByIves Possibly. I'm thinking in terms of the calendar as well. Euro teams may prefer their players to be at the Copa America.
Would love to be a fly on the wall when Piojo visits his Europe-based players. I'd be fascinated to know if any prefer the Copa America.
Costa Rica? RT @LuigiDur_: Mexico vs USA in the Gold Cup needs to happen already !!! Summer where are you!? @mexicoworldcup
Chicharito on TV after the match: It fell to me to score, but this is for all the team and the people who trusted in me.
Chicharito on TV after the game: To win in the Champions League, we have to defeat everyone.
Looked like Chicharito shed a  tear or two on the bench 
He knows he misses that little pea.
Nice to see from the Roon RT @WayneRooney: @CH14_  Yes congrats mate
Javier Hernandez the only Mexican in the semifinals of the Champions League. Keylor Navas the only other player from CONCACAF.
Good for Chicharito.
#MiercolesdeChicharito. His 8th goal in the Champions League. Such a vital goal. Real Madrid 1-0 Atletico Madrid.
Goooool Chicharito!
Chicharito close again. Good save.
Yep. Heavily involved. I think he is playing well. Should've done better with one chance. 
Halftime reading. The top 5 moments in Cuauhtemoc Blanco's career: 
Chicharito's 17th start and 30th appearance in the Champions League. He's netted 7 goals so far.
Alongside Torres RT @ESPNFCtri: Mexico international Raul Jimenez is on the bench for Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid 
These are the occasions Chicharito joined Real Madrid for. You don't get this at Southampton, Stoke or even Sevilla.
Can't wait RT @ESPNFCtri: Chicharito starting for Real Madrid vs. Atletico Madrid in the Champions League 
Interesting RT @Stephentwoodman: @mexicoworldcup How Gareth Bale and Real Madrid sleep their way to the top 
@ExclusiveFUT @maikonleite17 His agent told @canchamural that a return to Mexico is likely, with Atlas a possibility.
No sure. Anyone? RT @Lazoninho: @mexicoworldcup Hi Tom, do you have any info about Diego Gama and if he will continue in Atletico Madrid B?
A lot of the headlines in Guadalajara newspapers this morning focusing on Chivas "gifting" Cuauhtemoc a final trophy.
Three takes from Puebla lifting the Copa MX, Cuauhtemoc retiring and Chivas misfiring 
Puebla send Cuauhtemoc Blanco out on top in 4-2 win vs. Chivas 

Had to be Cuauhtemoc Blanco to lift the trophy. Puebla Copa MX champion!
Looks like Cuauhtemoc Blanco is going to lift the cup.
May well be the last game for quite a few of the Chivas players on show tonight.
Poor that from Chivas. Marin, Alvarez and Araujo never looked comfortable.
Puebla 4-2 Chivas. Puebla the Copa MX champion for the 5th time in Cuauhtemoc Blanco's last appearance as a pro.
Say Chivas fans everywhere RT @rnancy: Soooooooo can we cancel the game and do this again another day? @mexicoworldcup #Chivas
Lights out in 2nd half injury time. It's all going on.
Cuau with a really good chance to score there.
Red card Marin. All going wrong now for Chivas.
De Nigris puts the penalty wide! Puebla 4-2 Chivas. 4 mins to go.
Penalty Chivas.

Cuauhtemoc Blanco coming on for Puebla. Last ever match as a pro.
Goooool Alustiza. That surely (maybe) wraps it up. Puebla 4-2 Chivas.
@therealFLO jajaja.
Straight to PKs RT @uh_livia: @mexicoworldcup should this end in a tie, extra time or straight to PK's?
Still goals to come here …
Alustiza steps up and scores for Puebla. Puebla 3-2 Chivas. Insane match this.
Penalty Puebla! bring on the Cuau!
Copa MX final a great game now. Surely Cuauhtemoc Blanco also has to come on at some point.
Gooool Chivas. De Nigris once again. Puebla 2-2 Chivas.
Goooool Chivas. De Nigris strikes. Puebla 2-1 Chivas.
Enter Fabian.
Chapo Sanchez coming on for Chivas. First change of the night. Chivas 2-0 down and Fabian, Fierro on the bench.
All reports suggest that he will RT @alsafin: @mexicoworldcup Chicha gonna start tomorrow? Hearing anything?

@thestraygoat That bad?
I say Fabian and Salcedo at HT -- Chivas bench: Bravo, Salcedo, Chaton, Sanchez, Fierro, Michel, Fabian.
Chivas all over the place at the back. Could've been worse than 2-0 there.
Fair play to Puebla. Extremely intense 1st half from La Franja. Used well-organized free-kicks to their advantage. Puebla 2-0 Chivas.
Puebla may regret those two missed opportunities. Expect a different Chivas to come out after the break.
Cubo has gone down very easily twice in this first half.
De Nigris, Cubo. Still a decent team RT @Lalo1711: @mexicoworldcup at school...who's starting!!?! Fabian and Bravo on the bench???
@OmvrTinoco parece que esta en la cochera o algo
@DonTical_Futbol THink Fabian would like the challenge here.
Will check the rules …  RT @DonTical_Futbol: @mexicoworldcup can we make 11 subs?
2-0 RT @juangrimaldo79: @mexicoworldcup "Gol de Puebla rey"

I'd get Fabian on at halftime for sure and think about Fierro and even Bravo.
What a chance that was for Alustiza to make it three.
Gooool Puebla. Luis Gabriel Rey heads in for Puebla's second. Puebla 2-0 Chivas.
42-year-old Cuau on bench to freshen things up RT @TweetsByAbe: @mexicoworldcup Puebla will tire, recall the league game earlier this year
Not good from Tono Rodriguez RT @juangrimaldo79: @mexicoworldcup "Gol de Puebla"

Chivas need to hang on a bit here. Puebla have come out swinging. Not an easy pitch to play on.

Gooooool Puebla. Well worked free-kick headed in by former Atlas player Facundo Erpen. Assist by Michael Orozco. Puebla 1-0 Chivas.
@mark_arthur @cesarhfutbol @ESPNFCtri i think I wrote the other day that Chivas have as good a chance as anyone of winning the league ...
Copa MX final is underway! Puebla or Chivas?
No extra time tonight. Cup will be decided in 90 mins. Penalties if scores are level. Believe one Cuauhtemoc Blanco may be on field by then.
Yes RT @socceroverthere: @mexicoworldcup Herc on the bench?
Puebla going for cup number five tonight. Chivas for their first  trophy since the Apertura 2006. #CopaMX
No. Only one game. RT @CesarAvellan: @mexicoworldcup is this a 2 legged final?
A big screen has been set up at La Minerva in Guadalajara. Chivas fans being invited down there. Will be a celebration if Chivas win this.
Advantage Puebla with the line-ups. Chivas fielding a reserve side, while la Franja at full strength. #CopaMX #AdiosalCuau
@Neymismo Think it was the right decision by Chepo. This team has got them this far. Players deserve their shot.
Puebla XI vs. Chivas in Copa MX final: Villaseñor, Rojas, Torres, Rey, Noriega, Pérez, Santos, Orozco, Tamay, Erpen, Alustiza.
Chivas XI vs. Puebla in Copa MX final: Rodriguez, Vidrio, Marin, Alvarez, Ponce, Araujo, Toledo, Arce, Hernández, Cubo Torres, De Nigris
So no Cuauhtemoc Blanco in Puebla's starting XI.
#Chivas RT @Ze_Javier: Mood right now. 

<TROPHY> 
Good stuff! RT @CadChica: Fin de Una Era: Cuauhtémoc Blanco (@cuauhtemocb10) 
Assist from Hector Herrera for Jackson Martinez.
@fasalinas_2096 He's certainly not shied away from trying to get the ball down and pass it.
Hector Herrera not having a great game at all.

@SergioM81984498 Reyes wasn't playing well, but no worse than others.
Don't think he played well, but then no Porto player has RT @AlexHdz617: @mexicoworldcup Germany vs Brazil? I'm going for a 7-1
5-0. Porto obviously poor here, but Bayern have been absolutely sensational. A joy to watch.
All over now. Bayern score number four.
Not good RT @ESPNFCtri: Diego Reyes taken off in the 32nd minute. Not a great first Champions League start for the Mexico international.
@the_bonnfire It's not confirmed, but here is a report: 
3-0 Bayern. Going downhill fast for Porto. A bit like the America vs. Herediano match in the Azteca.
And another one for Bayern. Porto now need to score at least once. Poor goal to concede.
Gol Bayern. Absolutely dominating so far. Aggregate score now 3-2 in favor of Porto.
@TheColorfulKit jaja
Diego Reyes looking a bit nervous there. Don't blame him. Looks like he'll be playing right back.
Huge week for Mexican futbol: Reyes/Herrera/Hernandez in UCL, Cuau's retirement/Copa MX final, CCL final, Clasico Nacional.
Looks that way ...  
Reyes, Herrera and Jackson Martinez. 
@futgod I'd argue Reyes due to his style. Nothing against Moreno!
To put this start for Reyes in perspective, he's played just 171 mins over the Primeira Liga and Champions League for Porto this season.
Long dubbed as Rafa Marquez's replacement, these are the occasions where Diego Reyes has to prove it.
Really goes without saying, but what a massive game this is for Diego Reyes.
Hector Herrera and Diego Reyes both starting for Porto vs. Bayern Munich.

Arsenal linked with Hector Moreno 
@DonTical_Futbol Not sure, but I'm still not confident Chicharito will start even with the injuries!
Benzema, Bale out, Chicharito in for Real Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinal 2nd leg against Atletico Madrid?

What a goal. Bullet from Guisao for Toluca.
Tigres 3-0 Monterrey. Big win for Tigres in what is turning out to be a promising season.
Tigres up 2-0 vs. Monterrey in the Clasico Regio.

Gooooool Tigres. Lugo opens the scoring for Tigres in the Clasico Regio. Tigres 1-0 Monterrey.
Clasico Regio up next. Tigres vs. Monterrey. Not to be missed. Going for a MTY victory.
America 0-4 Queretaro. Wow. Not ideal for Las Aguilas ahead of CCL final. Two goals in 6 mins for Ronaldinho!
Good day for Chivas. Remained in 1st due to America's loss and now officially safe from relegation this season.
Big game 
@fifty_juan Would love to see him back here in Guadalajara with Atlas in a couple of years.
Good for Guardado. Was struggling this time last year. Made a great move and had an excellent season with PSV.

@BirdyMarquez Phrase "game management" comes to mind. It hasn't  been spectacular. Other clubs (America, Tigres MTY) haven't taken advantage
@JoelyAceves @WisoVazquez jaja. I think he is aproveching the moment.
Atlas can guarantee Chivas' survival in the Liga MX with a draw tomorrow vs. Puebla.
@veli147 Big decision for Chepo. Has De Nigris done enough? I'd say yes, but Chepo's starting team seems set.
@darthtwiggy1 Stopped the losing streak. Chivas a top side. Keeps Xolos safely in the liguilla places.
Great performance from Jair Pereira tonight. Omar Bravo in the right place at right time, once again …
Would love to see a clasico nacional with 1st place in the Liga MX at stake.
Clasico Nacional will be 1st against 2nd if America defeat Queretaro tomorrow.  #Chivas #America
Club Tijuana 1-1 Chivas. Not the worst result for both. Expect to see them in the playoffs.
Would make for a great game if Chepo went on the attack with 2 strikers RT @jhernandez83: Aldo @DeNigris9 debe ser titular ante #América
Sure he'd be happy with that. Americanistas prob not RT @TweetsByAbe: @mexicoworldcup Bravo ties the record in the super clasico?
Fabian so close on two occasions. Chivas pressurizing. Very similar to Chivas' last match vs. Leon. Chepo's attacking sub changes game.
@arqlopezg @KikoMagana 2
Omar Bravo just two goals away from leveling Chava Reyes as Chivas' all-time top scorer.
Goooool Chivas! Omar Bravo moves closer to Chava Reyes' record. Good ball in from Ponce, top flick-on from De Nigris and nice finish.
Game set. Chivas need goals and will push players forward. Xolos looking for take advantage of space left at the back.
Last week it was Salcido for De Nigris in the 70th. This week it's Castro for De Nigris in the 58th. Chepo on the attack.
Ciudado Sr. Salcido. Should've already be sent off and went flying in there.
Thinking Fierro will be taken off soon. Would swap him with Gio Hdz, take off Castro for Cubo and swap Bravo with De Nigris.
@ybatman @DonTical_Futbol Would do well, just a question of whether it'd be allowed.
Goool Chiapas. Chiapas 1-1 Veracruz. Xolos would be in 1st place if scores hold.
If the Tijuana and Veracruz scores hold, it'll be Veracruz leading the Liga MX tonight.
@darthtwiggy1 @Alex_Riggins Difficult because I'm not there. From TV it looks like Xolos have the majority.
Chivas being dominated here by Xolos. 68% possession so far for the home side 
@darthtwiggy1 @Alex_Riggins What would you say it is?
@DougMacESPN Enjoy!
Goooool Xolos. Corona swings in a corner, from which Chavez headed in.
Xolos first to the ball in first 15 minutes. On top against Chivas.
So close Huache. Great flick there from Dayro Moreno.
@DonTical_Futbol Each Liga MX team play one home game per season in los United. Like the Premier League's 39th game idea.
@DonTical_Futbol Should at least try. I feel like Liga MX clubs should be marketing more aggressively in the USA. Market already there.
Una Guardado, por fa RT @TheColorfulKit: Weekend Schedule- 4/18 - 
@Alex_Riggins Interesting. Chivas fans in the majority in a lot of stadiums. Shows how Xolos have grown.
These the type of nights Xolos could only dream of just a few years ago. Wish I was in the Estadio Caliente.
@RiosJose559 I am slightly disappointed Cubo doesn't start. I like watching youngsters develop. Can't blame Chepo though. Chivas in 1st.
Most lethal attack of the season (Xolos with 26 goals) against the best defense (Chivas with only 9 conceded).
Generalismo Juan Carlos Medina is ready RT @atlasfc: ¡Fiel! Estamos preparados para la Batalla de Puebla. #SoyFiel 
@RiosJose559 Most likely MLS and Houston Dynamo fans
Big game this for Xolos. Need to stop a run of 3 consecutive defeats in which they conceded 8 goals. No better way that vs. league leaders.
For those wondering, 'Cubo' Torres is on the bench for Chivas.
Xolos XI vs. Chivas: Saucedo, Nunez, Gandolfi, Chavez, Garza, Guemez, Corona, Ruiz, Hauche, Martinez Moreno.
Chivas XI vs. Xolos: Michel, Lopez, Pereira, Salcedo, Ponce, Castro, Salcido, Brizuela, Fabian, Fierro, Bravo.
Chivas' team picks itself these days …

Not great from Mexico tonight. Miguel Herrera thinks he got plenty of conclusions. I conclude that he has a difficult job picking 46 players
Pitch really is a joke in the Alamodome.
I'd say the crowd in the Alamodome is probably 70-30 in favor of Mexican fans.
I think Velarde, Saucedo, Flores, Osuna, Esquivel are the players that haven't secured a place in El Tri this summer.
What's going on in this Tigres game?!? 5-4?

@SoccerByIves Thanks, Ives!
Over 50 Americans playing professionally in Mexico as present. Here's my story on why and how they get there: 
@ArnoldcommaJon Thanks, Jon! Texan steak tonight I'm thinking.
@L_Rod i wouldnt worry. Almost certain game will go ahead.
Changes at Chivas. Press chief and the media co-ordinator have left the club.
No Chicharito, no Jimenez in Real Madrid vs. Atleti. Disappointing from Mexican point of view.
A report in Medio Tiempo suggests there is a possibility that US vs. Mexico may not go ahead due to state of pitch 
Good to see RT @ESPNFCtri: Guardiola on Hector Herrera: A fantastic player. Physically he's v strong. He seems slow, but he is v powerful.
Such an experimental line-up from Herrera this.  
 
@49ersSFGiants89 Makes logical sense.
Hoping to speak a little with @csalcedojr tomorrow after Mexico training about his meteoric rise over the last few months.
Good listening to Club America's Ventura Alvarado talk today as well. He's got bets on with Oribe and Paul Aguilar for Wednesday's game.
Interesting to watch Klinsmann in training for an extended period. Intense. What a difference to Herrera's relaxed Mexico training sessions.
@ramoncarden game on fox in the US. Will be writing and tweeting from @ESPNFCtri
@NickHogan4000 seems to be for Puebla. It is down to club's relegation situation, but Im sure Orozco wants to be with the US to win a spot.
@juan_manuelcas I agree. San Antonio isn't far and Orozco is capable of playing a few games in a week. He loses out much more than club.
Disappointing for Puebla's Michael Orozco, who won't travel to the US. Missed out last year as well. 
@soccercanales You should try to interview him! I think it would be a seriously good read.
#Chivas RT @CH14_: Qué alegría ver al equipo de mis amores @Chivas donde se merece estar. Todavía falta mucho camino. 
@WilsonCalvert I'd say the crowd in Phoenix a year ago was about 75/25 in Mexico's favor.

#Chivas RT @DonTical_Futbol: Mood gif #superlider 
Top job from Chepo in turning Chivas around. Not great in the 1st half today, but he went for the victory in the last 20 mins.
Chivas 1-0 Leon. Chivas top of league!
Watching the replay again. That was a top class finish from Fabian. Wasn't easy. Guided ball into the corner with the outside of his boot.
A real gift from former Chivas player Jonny Magallon to Fabian. Chivas 1-0 Leon.
goooool Chivas! Marco Fabian with it. Team do a ridiculous dance. Crowd go wild. Guadalajara on course for 1st in Liga MX.
Seven mins left. Would be a huge psychological boost for Chivas to win this and move into 1st position in the @LIGABancomerMX.
Chepo's sub seems to have put Chivas onto the front foot here. Lots of pressure on Leon now.
Headlines your never thought you'd read: Chocan senador y @herculezg en Twitter 
Sure both Chivas and Leon wouldn't be too disappointed with a draw. Looks that way on the pitch.
Gullit off the bar! It's like no-one wants to finish top of the Liga MX this weekend!
Omnilife still filling. Lots of traffic around the stadium due to construction. 0-0 between Chivas and Leon after 6 mins.
Interesting RT @miseleccionmx: No se otorgó ningún aval para que la AFC Soccer Academy realice visorías:

Over 43,000 in the Estadio Jalisco tonight for Leones Negros vs. Puebla.
Seeing the importance of Edwin Cardona to Monterrey tonight. Noticeable by his absence.
@SergioTrist10 @jonyrico jaja
Three US-born players starting in the huge Leones Negros (Jesus Vazquez) vs. Puebla (Michael Orozco, Herculez Gomez) relegation battle.
@jonyrico 1940s 
@jonyrico Chivas website (Chivas de corazón) - if you can bring yourself to visit - has an excellent history section.
Have to think the score of this game may be different now if Edwin Cardona was in place of Candido Ramirez for Monterrey.
Hmm Jurgen Damm not in Pachuca's squad to face Pumas. Hope the ankle isn't still a problem. He's in Mexico's squad to face USA.
Prediction: Lots of goals in Monterrey vs. America.
Don't care what Mohamed has been saying in the build up, he'd absolutely love to defeat America here.
My mistake there. Of course, Cubo Torres is suspended for Chivas after receiving a red card after the final whistle vs. Atlas. Apologies.
Gol Roque RT @juangrimaldo79: @mexicoworldcup 
Gooool Roque Santa Cruz for Cruz Azul. Well-guided header. Cruz Azul 1-0 Tigres.
Tickets for Chivas vs. Leon at the Estadio Omnilife tomorrow officially sold out. Chivas fans are finally taking to the stadium.
Good to see Chicharito starting and scoring for Real Madrid. He's pretty good.
Is Andres Guardado playing in Disneyland or what? 
@Reydorosco2 Can't argue with that. Wouldn't be surprised if Chivas urged Piojo not to call him though.
Injured. Replaced by Marco Bueno "@gabbyisel: @mexicoworldcup is Peralta injured? Or is it just a rumor? Will he be playing in #USAvMEX"
Queretaro's Orbelin Pineda making a habit of these golazos. What we expected (maybe unfairly) from Ronaldinho.
U-13 Clasico Tapatio. Starting them young RT @atlasfc: ¡Arranca la Gran Final #Sub13 en el Estadio Azteca!
Atlas vs @Chivas.
Ronaldinho starting tonight for Queretaro against Liga MX leader Club Tijuana.
#lucharito jaja "@VillasArmy: It’s official. Romance blooms for Chicharito and Lucia. #LuCharito ? @CH14_!

@SomosAnalistas jaja. Top character for the Mexican game and not a bad coach, either!
@Showtime48 Thanks!
Will America’s soccer ideologies survive the move to the mainstream? -- Great read from @sgevans 
Enjoying @Paulmcveigh77's book "The Stupid Footballer is Dead." Great read for young (and older) players everywhere.

Chivas announcing a partnership with Uber. It has been very controversial in Guadalajara. Low paid taxi drivers not happy at all.

@CESARPEREZx @Julionumber9 Other thing is I bet Euro clubs will prefer to have their players at Copa America, due to timing for next season.
Have to respect the way Tigres are backing a long-term project under Ferretti. Not easy in Mexico.
Tigres confirm that "Tuca" Ferretti has signed a new three-year deal to keep him as the club's manager until 2018.
@CESARPEREZx No prob. Two well thought out lists.
"@VillasArmy: #America should be allowed to bask in last nights win says @MexicoWorldCup. Thoughts? 
@AlexTorLimon96 Certainly the perception of how it is with Heriberto Morales, Aldo Leao, Vilar, Perez all moving to Atlas.
Love it! #GoldCup #CopaAmerica RT @CESARPEREZx: @mexicoworldcup I sat down &amp; analyzed the team. I came up with this: 
.@TheChampions final dates and times set: April 22 9 p.m. ET at the Azteca, April 29 8 p.m. ET at Olympic Stadium in Montreal.

Ya, en serio, ¿Qué les hizo Matosas?
Nice RT @forgottenkin: My copa oro and copa america squads @mexicoworldcup 
@the_algonquin Not sure. Think Liga MX is ahead, but don't think the gap is that big. Good MLS sides would do fine in Liga MX IMO.
For non-football news from Mexico, @Stephentwoodman posts some good stuff. Just don't pay attention if he tweets about boxing! Knows nothing
@delkouby I might go, but if I don't, I'm sure to be writing about it! You should go to the Azteca with the @impactmontreal porra.
@mansolor Cheers! Out of interest, who would be your number one choice to replace Boy at Atlas?
A few thoughts on a memorable night for Club America in the Estadio Azteca: 
@mansolor Good stuff! Glad to see you're not in hibernation after Atlas' past week! Moving house on Sat.
.@TheMasters underway. Has to be the year my bet on @WestwoodLee comes good!
Good speaking to Altamira goalkeeper @AustinGuerrero0 yesterday about his journey from San Diego to playing in Tamaulipas. An adventure!
Erick "Cubo" Torres, Carlos Salcedo selected in Mexico squad to face United States. Full squad: 
America turns on the style as Dario Benedetto's four goals lead Las Aguilas into the CCL final  
@soccermusings Animo!
The Quintero/Peralta/Benedetto   triumvirate upfront finally clicked. 6-0 score-lines are entirely possible when it does.
Memorable performance that from Club America. Shouldn't be diminished even if Herediano was poor.
@OffTheWoodworkx @impactmontreal @clubamerica No problem! Look forward to it.
@Sean_Yancy Unlikely, but CCL final would be the most important game.
Club America looking to make it the 10th consecutive title for Mexican teams in #CCL.
Imagine America potentially playing a reserve team in a clasico vs. Chivas. Could already be qualified for playoffs by then.
Montreal trying to get MLS to change calendar to help them in the final. Doubt Liga MX would do the same with the clasico to play.
Yes, CCL final 2nd leg just 3 days after Chivas vs. America at the Omnilife RT @LuisVee16: @mexicoworldcup 3 days after the Clasico ??
Number six for America. Las Aguilas heading to the final of @TheChampions. Have made this look extremely easy.
Montreal has done wonders to make the final, but by far the biggest test is to come. America is the best team at present in CONCACAF for me.
America coasting to the CCL final. 1st leg on April 22 at the Azteca, with the return in Montreal on April 29.
Rubens Sambueza getting a huge reception from America fans. Great game from him.
Tigres 2-2 River Plate. Shame Tigres couldn't hold on for a famous victory in the Libertadores. Tuca won't be happy.
Sensational half from Club America. Matosas' Ferrari is firing on all cylinders. America 5-0 Herediano after 45 minutes.
Tigres 2-2 River Plate. Still a couple of mins left ...
Benedetto with his fourth, America's fifth. Las Aguilas on fire here. Herediano has no answer to the waves of attacks. America 5-0 Herediano
5
@GalindoPW Been very impressed with Impact. Sure they won't be as bad as Herediano tonight, but America frightening when in this form.
Herediano down to 10. Nelson sent off. Wheels falling off for the Costa Rican side.
Number 4. Benedetto's third. America 4-0 Herediano.
Looks very much like Tigres are sending River Plate out of the Copa Libertadores.
Gooool Tigres. Damian Alvarez against his former club. He doesn't celebrate. Tigres 2-0 River Plate.
Wow. It's taken America less than 19 mins. Benedetto with the third. America 3-0 Herediano. Score now level on aggregate.
No way I can see America keeping a clean sheet here. Defending all over the place, especially from set pieces.
@FWjonmcg @davisjsn Ventura Alvarado in the starting XI
10 mins gone. America already 2-0 up. We're seeing the kind of football Matosas promised so far.
Goal America. This is on. Benedetto golazo. America 2-0 Herediano.
That goal a great example of how America could function under Matosas. Players linked up well there.
Goooool America! Quintero nets in the 4th minute. Lovely move that. Game on. America 1-0 Herediano.
Not a great start for America …
Going for America to win 3-1 tonight. Predictions?
@DonTical_Futbol I think they'll fall just short.
11 of the previous 12 finalists in the #CCL since the new format began have been from Mexico.
Would be the first time since 2004 that a Mexican side has not been in the final of the #CCL if America can't do this.
Extremely attacking America line-up with Martinez, Sambueza, Quintero, Benedetto and Peralta all starting.
Big night for Gustavo Matosas. Even if America don't go through, he needs his players to  show they are behind him.
America XI v Herediano: Gonzalez, Aguilar, Alvarado, Pablo Aguilar, Samudio, Pellerano, Martinez, Sambueza, Quintero, Peralta, Benedetto
Another mature display from Tigres in the Copa Libertadores so far. Looking good.
All Liga MX fans supporting Las Aguilas tonight or prefer that Herediano advance to the #CCL final?
Talked to Jurgen Damm following his international debut vs. Ecuador. He'll likely start against the US next week.  
Congrats to @csalcedojr on his Mexico call-up! Here's my story on him from when he was still at Real Salt Lake 
Great goal. Arevalo strokes home from the edge of the area. Nice build up. Tigres 1-0 River Plate.
Tigres already through to the knockout stage of the Copa Libertadores. Chance against River here to really make a statement.
No tickets left for Club America vs. Herediano. The Azteca will be full! Can't wait for it.
Tigres going with full team vs. River. Will be an insane atmosphere tonight in the Estadio Universitario.
Tigres bidding to knock River Plate out of the Copa Libertadores. Would be a huge scalp.

I think they'll fall just short RT @ESPNFCtri: Club America fans confident of overhauling the 3-0 deficit against Herediano?
@DonBigVic @KrazyKing3 It's because he is running for election and Cuau can't play and be a candidate at the same time.
Pretty sure a loophole will be found RT @KrazyKing3: @mexicoworldcup I thought he said on April 18 he was going to retire?
@KingsPapa1015 I think so. It's good for competition. Still expect Mexican clubs to be favorites next year.
Cuauhtemoc Blanco's last game in professional football looks likely to be the Copa MX on April 21 against his old rival Chivas.
Congrats @impactmontreal! First team through to @TheChampions final. America or (most likely) Herediano await.

Will be interesting to see what happens to Tomas Boy. Atlas do play some pretty football, but have they got it tactically to win titles?
Atlas 1-3 Colo Colo. Libertadores dream over for Atlas. Ran out of steam tonight and are obviously weak against counter-attacking teams.
Loud cries of "Fuera Boy, Fuera Boy" from the stands of the Jalisco as Colo Colo net their third. Atlas 1-3 Colo Colo.
Exactly! Same game! RT @WisoVazquez: I feel like I was at this game already about a month ago with @mexicoworldcup and @TomasGoubin #dejavu
@ExclusiveFUT Im in the stadium. Colo Colo had threatened on the counter. I thought it was coming.
Goooool Colo-Colo. That was on the cards. Atlas' weak link is getting caught on the counter. Teams know that. Atlas 1-2 Colo Colo.
