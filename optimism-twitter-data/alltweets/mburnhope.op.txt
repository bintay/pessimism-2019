I just saw a picture of Hershel Green from #TWD. Now come on Internet that isn't fair. *sobs*
@HylomantisL @bendyleopard @Slothyface Can I wheel over it first please.
@bendyleopard @Slothyface LOL it's like white cis women's experience bingo.

#ToriesOutNow 
To be fair, the Women of WWII would have probably graffitied that Women of WWII memorial. #ToriesOutNow
It's funny, many of the ppl who are condemning the #ToriesOutNow protests are the same privileged ppl who will never be saying #wecantmarch.
@MikaMurstein But I'm pro anti-state violent resistance when necessary, especially when painted as "violence" by propaganda.
@MikaMurstein All war and violence is not equal. I am a pacifist when it comes to state-sanctioned war, imperialism + genocide.
@MikaMurstein Haha you're welcome I'm glad I could help. Humour is an activist tool like the rest.
@bendyleopard @Slothyface I want to knooooow. :p
@MikaMurstein I couldn't resist. Just taking it up a level. :/
#wecantmarch but many of us could operate remote explosives. Wait what?
@veidtlemania Damn right there is. Ugh.
We didn't get the right government voted in because too many UK people prioritize splashing a statue with paint over dead disabled people.
@veidtlemania At least it helps us sort the wheat from the chaff regarding who actually cares about us.
Th…
That's why people came out t…
I want to be a comedian when I grow up so that if I ever struggle I can also be a famous political commentator with no qualifications.
@lightacandleOTM @chunkymark The pigs are smiling.
@Jpofgwynedd Funny, I was under the impression we had a dictatorship already.
I wish there wasn't a direct correlation between the sun going down and my mood.
Oh I get it, violence is necessary as long as your government + state says it is.
I love how none of these ppl look at wars and go "OH BUT surely there must be another way, what if someone gets hurt + property is damaged?"
It's very frustrating to read overly-polite, socially conservative people being confronted with the realities of protest.
Because you know what, when austerity is all said and done + we're counting the cost, I'm not expecting any "lest we forget" about US.
FYI: if you put stone statues + war memorials over the lives of me and my disabled friends + community I will consider you as bad as a Tory.
@HylomantisL Fetch the engines, fetch the engines.
When I said "Ugh they can burn down London for all I care" she said "Thanks, I live there." Because yes I had just said "I hope you die." :/
Newsflash: Your government does not give two shits about the law.
Nope, not doing that anymore. Apparently property damage isn't the way + in order to really change the law... Something else. Block.
@MargoJMilne "Vandalising"? Jesus, are we really that prim and proper? Who do you care more about, people or fucking statues?
@MargoJMilne Oh dear. Well, I hope you get out before it happens.
@MargoJMilne As for people getting hurt, yes, probably tens of thousands of disabled people are dying under the Tories.
@MargoJMilne I don't give a fuck about property damage, they can burn down London for all I care.
@MargoJMilne They were all going to do disabled people over it was just a matter of how fast. Sometimes violent force is necessary response.
@MargoJMilne What are you hoping to achieve by tweeting that? As I say, do you have a better idea?
@MargoJMilne Or shall we just sit on our arses and just talk about how voting for Labour would've been better.
@MargoJMilne Have you got a better idea? Maybe people just want to be visibly angry.
@MargoJMilne Right. I guess they'd all better pack up and go home then.
#WeCantMarch but we can fight propaganda + misinformation with the facts + realities for disabled people living under the Tories.
Folks, "gender-fluid" is not an umbrella term. Stop using it as one.
@MelisaTerlecki @FedoraHippie This is great news but I wish they hadn't used "gender-fluid." Yeah, gender-fluid and everyone else NB.
One guy just called the protests a "mob", in spite of apparently being politically onside. That's Britishness folks. Fuck that.

Oh btw I will be blocking anyone saying these #FuckTheTories protests are "counter-productive" + withholding any better ideas.

#FuckTheTories
@LUBOttom Let me check with my family what dates might be suitable and get back to you. :)
@dinogoldie "Mob"? Are you serious? Would you prefer a politer method of protest? Maybe we could go over there and ask them to stand down.
@LUBOttom Also, that's the first time I've heard the phrase "tweet up."
@LUBOttom Awesome. Sure, yes in theory I'd love that.
@LUBOttom Yes I do! :)
#London protesters, as always I am very proud of you. #GetTheToriesOut #ToriesOutNow
@LUBOttom Much love, solidarity and support from currently-sunny-but-who-knows-for-how-long(?) Bournemouth x
They're protesting. And I've just cracked the first smile in two days.
Police now kettled a section of the protest. Chants of 'move pigs, get out the way'  
@alisonbates200 Nothing will change unless it does.
‘They say cut back, we say fightback!’ #ToriesOut #GE2015 @resistunite 
@Dis_PPL_Pro…
Police scuffle with demonstrators outside Downing Street 
@Dis_PPL_Protest
Police are getting violent, starting to kettle protestors outside Downing Street 
@EmilyHasler Oh, it was all in fun so I wasn't worried in the slightest. But thank you for noticing :)
Heavy clashes in London, people disgusted by new #Cameron government @RTUKnews @RuptlyNewsroom  
Just had fish chips + peas, an archetypally British dinner, to celebrate the reinstatement of an archetypally British leadership. What what.
@narco_sam @LonAitewalker @averrer @latentexistence Any organising needs to be done with various co-existing methods + ideas.
@narco_sam @LonAitewalker @averrer @latentexistence Are the easiest things the best things? Disabled ppl need many approaches, not just one.
@averrer @narco_sam @LonAitewalker @latentexistence "But that wouldn't work because no-ones used to it." We could say this about everything.

Sorry, can't tell you, it's private.
1st on the list, the working disabled.


@Slothyface Your dad is best dad.
I don't feel violent anymore, just bored.
The Curious Incident of Trolling Mark Haddon in the Day-Time.
@mark_haddon @AnathemaJane Not really, I prefer irrational, hysterical, subjective SJW posturing.
I really just don't remember the last time I thought "adrenaline" was something worth pursuing. Am I broken?
@AnathemaJane @mark_haddon Haha. Because yeah, all death is bad, but let's have some perspective here.
@WOWpetition But he should look on the bright side: now he'll be funded for way more "Derek" episodes!!!
Less "disabled community", more "disabled army." Plz. Thanx.
Somebody who has me blocked just said "They're not all bad" about the Conservatives.
Charlotte Church "lost faith in humanity" after Tory win. I want to know where she got her faith in humanity to begin with.
So Mark Haddon tweets about as well as he writes books.
@mark_haddon I don't even know why I'm arguing about this. That's what boredom on a Saturday does for you.
@mark_haddon I'd rather a stun which wasn't "always" instant than being torn apart by hunting dogs, which is never instant.
@mark_haddon That's a myth. The same procedures are used in most modern halal slaughter, just prayers are said as well. Do your research.
@mark_haddon Outdoors? Adrenaline? OK, fine. Why not just say "I like fox hunting"?
@mark_haddon You'd rather die by being gradually torn apart by dogs than by instant stun?
#LRT Are they serious? Does anyone think a petition like that is going to work?
So today I'm wearing a femme top but I haven't bothered shaving my face.
@Barnabyspeak @sphenefan I think it's "I hate disabled people I hope they all die."
The thing is, I can say "Kill Tories" all I want but we will still never have a 1 Tory dead to every 100 disabled people ratio. Sad.
@ianpuddick @sphenefan Somebody needs to kill him.
@AcademicAnge @ChrisGiles7 @MsVanillaRose That "taxpayer" category again + the Left have bought into the nonsense. The poor pay taxes.
@AcademicAnge Their support for assisted suicide, as if the #NotDeadYet campaign wasn't even happening, is a dealbreaker for me.
@AcademicAnge It's almost as if they've copied the Social Model of Disability Wikipedia page. Great stuff but what then?
@AcademicAnge Except for maybe the Greens, but all of their good disability stuff is theory.
@AcademicAnge Sadly I agree. I've never seen any Left party say anything that I knew was looking out for me as an unwaged cripple.
No fucking way that happened. This nation of ours is just full of Conservatives. Social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, same diff.
...thought "Ugh, Labour are such bandwagon jumpers + they've abandoned the working-class! Guess there's nothing for it but to vote Tory."
Another thing: I really don't fucking believe that Labour lost because they "weren't left enough." Is the UK crawling with lefties who...
@whedonworship I'll take £10 to go + smash Toryscum heads in,
So I'm not looking for votes, I'm looking for victory. If that's too much + you were just looking for cultural analysis, unfollow me.
@kevstanley66 It helps me to remember that "peace" is what it's called when oppressors are allowed to go quietly along with the status quo.
@kevstanley66 Somebody arm me to the teeth with the army's weaponry, though, and we'll see who gets things done.
@kevstanley66 Yup. Me: powerless, 5'6", in a wheelchair + a Jurassic Park fan, TERRIFYING THREAT. Conservative British army: FREEDOM!!!!!!
@AcademicAnge @suey2y Maybe it's just a matter of time and Maximus will "turn over a new leaf." ;) Or maybe um not.
"Oh God, someone's using violent language on the Internet! I'd better get back to hanging up my VE Day bunting."
Oops, someone has unfollowed me. Good.
Right. Now I need to calm down.
Because I can't think of an answer that isn't really fucking entertaining.
The question is not "How will we win back their votes?" but "How do we deal with fascists?" That question makes me OK with being alive.
They don't care about us. They're not going to care about us. We're not going to "win back their votes." They are fascists.
Tired of reading "Look how UNREASONABLE they are!" as if Tories aren't shrugging shoulders + tucking back into farmer's market pheasant.
Say for example u think this election was won by the right-wing press. How do u take back the right-wing press? By force, not asking nicely.
It's all war at the end of the day. I'm in a war. We're in a war. Days like VE Day exist to distract us + make us think of old ones.
Ppl read "violent" words on the Internet + panic that the ppl behind them aren't good ppl, but they'll celebrate VE Day + men with guns.
They don't teach that kind of pain in Oxford + Cambridge. So we have to teach them.
We've been dying. I say they need to start learning what that feels like.
@nanayasleeps And probably some sleeping hours, too, in which I'll be able to watch it happen.
@nanayasleeps Which is why I don't do it. My waking hours for the next 5 years will be spent thinking about how to exterminate Tories.
I am damn sick + tired of "raising awareness." Can you SEE now why I don't bother + why my activism consists of just making noise?
They have no compassion and they want to see disabled people dead. Fuck voting, that's the truth. That's what we are fighting.
We have to fight them. We have to eradicate them. Somehow. How, I don't know. But they need to be wiped out like the vermin they are.
So it's really not worth throwing around *information* anymore, as if Conservatives READ *information* and go oh shit, we're doing it wrong.
They haven't *forgotten* humans have rights. They haven't *forgotten*, accidentally, that the disabled are dying. They don't give a fuck.
It just isn't good enough trying to milk "compassion" for the disabled + sick out of Tories, or reminding them constantly about our rights.
The answer to "What is a right?", dear Tories: Whatever your government decides it is.
Of course, ppl who vote Tory don't give a shit about human rights. Just ask them. They'll say inept tosh like "But what is a RIGHT anyway?"
Been up for roughly an hour now and apparently we still have a Conservative government? Alright then, UK. *slow clap*


@dogunderwater @AnaMardoll Or cis women, while we're at it.
@ConorWalshy Same. It's terrifying and makes absolutely no sense for anyone with a heart.
@ConorWalshy deficit taxpayer working families makes my blood boil, something like that
@HylomantisL @glasgballetgirl @redrumlisa @OwenJones84 Every time I hear / read the term it becomes clearer we're not being represented.
Watching The Babadook was probably not a good idea. Now I'm trying to find something to take that taste away.
Struggling. Maybe I'll just go to bed.
In fact, I need to think on it more but atm I think it was an ableist pile.
Wow, I really don't think I liked The Babadook.
@trishteachermum @SovereignAnnie I didn't find "there'll be plenty folk worse off than you" very inclusive. But never mind. Take care.
Just let me feel like shit for a while. We have 5 bloody years of this to get through.
Please don't tell me how I need to be handling this post-election shit by being more charitable to people "worse off than me."
@trishteachermum @SovereignAnnie I'm disabled, poor + can't give my family's food away. Can we maybe just be depressed tomorrow?
@averrer I had heard similar things. To be honest I've not watched it yet because I'll either love it or hate it.
@SovereignAnnie @trishteachermum Can we not with the "people worse off than you" crap?
So I'm as good as on my own in the house tonight. I might watch The Babadook. What can possibly go wrong?
@DarkenHerHorse Wondering about changing my name legally anyway, so who knows I might wait until then anyway.
@DarkenHerHorse For now I'm using it as an opportunity for a break. There are too many hoops to jump through + I don't have the energy.
@DarkenHerHorse I'm not sure if someone reported me, or how it even happens, but I was booted off.
@DarkenHerHorse I was hit by the transphobic "real names" policy. Apparently adding 2 letters to my name means I need to prove my identity.
Just once I'd like a headline that treated us like human beings.
Why are we always being urged to look at the euphoric, tear-filled facial expressions of disabled people?
@sudorossy @FedoraHippie Kind of click-baity inspiration porn preamble ("Look at the joy on her face", really?), but cool story.

@DominionSyfy Ooh I am looking forward to this!
Rosario Dawson will be back for Season 2 of @netflix's @Daredevil! Woop. Can we make her a season regular please, k thanks?
The more Access to Work schemes the Tories cut, the less interested I am in working.
I just read an article refer to it as "Jurassic Park 4: World." Because a title like that would REALLY pull the punters in.
@CounsellingKaz I totally do!
@CounsellingKaz I'm OK with dull. Dull and friendly are much-needed qualities in my life atm. :)
And maybe a bit of Taylor Swift.
For those just joining me my account will be intersectional transfeminist anger occasionally interspersed with Jurassic World + The X-Files.
But if I did follow you, hello! I kind of need friends at the moment, you'll do.
I just followed a bunch of followers. It may have been you, if your profile was glittery enough. Probably not if your profile was too vague.
@AndreasLeKirk @marxroadrunner Yep. As soon as all this affects his career in any way he fucks off.
@cosmicvirgin @FedoraHippie I got unfriended exactly this way by a trans "ally", because I subtweeted about one of her transphobe friends.
cis ppl: well if you stopped sub tweeting me :( im the victim
@PaulHewitt50 Oh I have the courage, I just don't have the weaponry.
@averrer At least she felt better.
@averrer But of course I was very polite + acted as if it was my own mistake, because I always do.
@averrer I was thinking "What the fuck? This is a conversation we didn't even have. I'm not LATE I'm early for the appointment we arranged."
@The_Wolfster They've all been popular over the last several years. The propaganda has been in full force for over a decade now.
It's also not my fault I don't have a landline + I don't usually use my mobile. Ugh.
I have hydrocephalus, memory problems, and I'm under stress. If I make it to an appointment then I've made it. I'm not "late."
I almost apologized as well. Never again. If you decide the appointment you made with me doesn't suit you, tough shit. Make it properly.
So I said "Look I'm sorry, my only phone's been off. But we made my appointment together, I stuck to it. I'm not late." Fucking gaslighter.
She said "Yes you are. I've been trying to ring you all week. I couldn't do 10.20 after all so I had to make it 9.40."
Turned up to my appointment this morning + my nurse said "You're 40 minutes late." I said "What? No I'm not the appointment was 10.20."
&gt; On Benefits &amp; Proud, Benefits Britain, Benefit Busters + tonnes more. If you watch these, congratulations, you're part of the problem.
Jeremy Kyle, Benefits Street, Rogue Traders, The Undateables, Derek, Little Britain / Come Fly With Me, Secret Millionaire &gt;
@GillianGn Sometimes I wish our parents (collectively) could manage to have a thought that wasn't "Aww come on you'll be alright."
@stonewalluk Are you fucking kidding me?
@averrer @SciPhiKat Aww diddums, we can't have that now can we.
So how many other disabled people's parents just voted against them I wonder.
@SciPhiKat My parents are the same. I just don't talk politics with them because it's utterly pointless. Solidarity.
@felixtension Well, I don't know what I'm feeling. But I will be something resembling OK. :)
@SciPhiKat She said that? :/
Literally not following anyone whose message to the devastated, on Twitter, is "Get off Twitter" and do... I don't even know. What do we do?
@bridgetminamore What would you suggest we do after we've got off Twitter?
I haven't even had my PIP assessment yet. I still get DLA. I was hoping to get it done under a different government. Fuck.
@felixtension If that's all you can do, that's everything.
@felixtension I know, same. Yes, we must. Solidarity to you! Are you OK? Sorry I've been quiet.
@AcademicAnge @latentexistence We don't count and we never counted. This is why I'll call the UK ableist however many "awwws" we receive.
The nurse was feeling all gaslightey today. Awesome.
Right, this morning (in a minute actually) I have a doctor's appointment. HAHA. HA. HA. *wipes tears away* See you after.
I once said we need a vigilante like @Daredevil but I think @netflix has confirmed he only cares about white people anyway so we're fucked.
Also, stop fucking selling me fucking unions. How the fuck do I join a fucking union as a fucking cripple without a fucking job.
@geeoharee Yeah. I don't get this. Genuinely tired of this water-from-a-rock "Have some compassion!" rhetoric. It isn't going to happen.
@Independent @debecca Good, I hope she starves and rots.
I wish I could send a collective hug to everyone disabled + sick on Twitter rn.

That's where your vote…
@destieluk I love you too.
@nanayasleeps Thank you. I will spend every night for the next 5 years dreaming of leaving the UK but it's never happening.
@destieluk You will be great + everything will be great. I miss you already.
Also my wife is away for the weekend + every time I feel crushed. My friends are going to need to know that but I won't bang on about it.
So for the next 5 years my plan is to continue to be visible + loud as all hell, and not in all the ways you wanted.
If you can still afford to be optimistic I'm genuinely happy for you, really, but all I need is recognition, solidarity and help.
@TechnicallyRon @thisisamy_ He looks like a totally awful waxwork figurine of Mr. Bean.
Just FYI I'm going to block any unrealistically optimistic bullshit under the assumption it's privileged + has no idea what's happening.
Oh well, if we're going down, I'm going down eating. Lunch out today.
LOL, "Cable and Balls" sounds like some sexual torture device.
@justicefornico @bear_faced_lady I appreciate that, I really do.
@Takooba @TheAuracl3 #NotAllBrits ? Really? Are we going to do THAT right now?
@justicefornico @bear_faced_lady I had no power yesterday either. But I admire your strength, truly. If I run out, this may be all yours.
@justicefornico @bear_faced_lady I didn't "let them" take anyone's power they've already taken, but nice thoughts.
#LRT unless you're a Tory, and then you can hug a working chainsaw.
@amahra_ @SelinaNBrown Imagine having the privilege of being able to vote based on "not liking" an MP.
Tbh I avoided talking politics in the run-up because I saw it happening this way. I do not trust the UK public as far as I can count them.
FASCISM.
ISLAND.
Either that, or they HAVE shown us a spoiler and then scrubbed it out. Because I'm hoping it's the former, not the latter.
So apparently "foilers" are a thing? Fake spoilers that are designed to play with your head. Jurassic World might have just shown us one.
Today I'll be immersing myself in pointless Jurassic World fandom shit. If I'm about to crumble under politics at least I can delay it.
I'm going to bed.
Because you know what, I don't even want to buy a chocolate bar from your shit hole shop if you voted Tory or UKIP.
My brain: "I think I'll go into town tomorrow that'll take my mind off things." 

My brain: "Oh wait I have no idea who to fucking trust."
If you thought I was too angry before, wow. I feel sorry for you.
Well, I've lost hope for this country. I'm going to need to find something else. Any ideas?
@GracieSamuels @AtosMiraclesfb Then they'll do it again, because they hate us.
This is what I've been doing. I was never down with this "You could be disabled TOMORROW" stuff. Because you fucking aren't. But I am yanno?
I'm tired of rhetoric. What are we DOING? Next election I don't want to say "I COULD BE YOUR CHILD" I want to say "I am me but do you care?"
@IamMrJ Same tbh.
We need a different tactic other than lying to ourselves about how many UK people are really on the Left, they're just quiet about it.
Pretty tired of Lefties saying that "the (ordinary???) people" don't want to be ruled by Tories. Stop it. Because apparently they do?
Do you know what a really annoying phrase is? "Faith in humanity restored." Who are you trying to kid?
@LUBOttom Hell.
@reeltourshawaii @Sickle_Claw @ChrisLikesDinos @JurassicPark Is Nedry responsible for this?
@JoshBarker1983 @reeltourshawaii Also that. Yes, I hope it's the pteranodon's leg.
@Sickle_Claw @reeltourshawaii @ChrisLikesDinos @JurassicPark Haha. Oh dear. I don't like it so am choosing to believe it won't happen.
@reeltourshawaii @Sickle_Claw @ChrisLikesDinos @JurassicPark Is it possible they've changed the plot or just deleted the spoiler, LOL.
@JurassicPark I don't see that phantom arm in the pteranodon's mouth anymore. Weird. Maybe Zara lives after all!

@AcademicAnge @thisisapollo It's bullshit. As is "If you didn't vote, you have no right to complain." Nope. We need to complain in numbers.
Allow me to change the subject for a second: I do not care what Kylie Jenner chooses to do with her lips, or tell the press about it.
Maybe the tone-police are right + if we're really really nice to the ableist shit heads for the next 5 years they won't vote Tory next time.
@girlonthenet @nanayasleeps @sazza_jay Haha! Glad you liked it. :)
@nanayasleeps @sazza_jay @girlonthenet "Misandry on the Orient Express."
I'm sorry but will somebody other than a fucking abled cis white man urge me to "unite with the Left"?
@notwaving I was always convinced that Russell Brand will do whatever pays his bills.
@poetniall @EmilyHasler @msamykey Just tell me what to believe in now tbh. I'll do it if it keeps me ticking.
@nanayasleeps @LUBOttom *hugs if needed* None of us did this, you're right. Our hands are clean.
@notwaving Haha, right on.
@EmilyHasler @poetniall @msamykey If they can't speculate they'll speculate on the philosophical nature of speculation.
"Violence is never the answer." Says the privileged dipshit who has no idea what the questions are.
@notwaving I hope they burn down Westminster to be honest.
I would be disappointed if there wasn't.
@sazza_jay @girlonthenet You should have told him you prefer contemporary stuff like "When Men On Trains Are Cunts."
@CassandraB Yep, same.
@CassandraB I'm not actually watching it because I don't watch TV anymore. I'm just on Twitter, despairing.
We're going to have to get together and talk about how we just can't with this anymore. We're going to have to just can't together.
LOL remember all the leftie-lite people who were all like "The people are beginning to see the light!" *hysterical laughter*
Gonna have to mute 1 or 2 ppl tweeting like they're soaring above the consequences of these results looking down like golden fucking eagles.
@MammaMumra This is a bit unfair towards satanists.
@marxroadrunner Tbf this might be the most life-affirming route out of this hell.
If you've joined us on this channel: there will be fucking swearing, OK? OK. Fuck.
I'm not even angry. I have no energy left to be angry.
@sazza_jay I fucking can. Tories are fucking murderers and Tory voters are pro-genocide.

That’ll learn ‘em….
The problem is that we DON'T have a T-Rex.
Enough of this "the tide is turning" nonsense. It isn't. The UK is an anti-disabled stinkhole.
Tell you what: next time we'd better find some better cliches than "You might get old / disabled / sick." Tories don't give two shits.
@kieran_hurley @RainbowSerina I wonder if they'd die more quietly.
Tories, it's time to fuck off out of my life. For real. You know where the "unfollow" button is.
OK so somebody better tell me where to find 5 more years' worth of fucks.

@AnaMardoll "Look I'm about to be nasty to you + flounce from your presence, but you can stop this drama by being really kind + nice to me."
I'm going to play the Jurassic Park soundtrack to myself all night so that when the time comes, I can pretend that Laura Dern was voted in.

Friends, if we were all close I would be throwing a "I'm Nervous As Fuck Everything Is Probably Fucked Are We Fucked?" party.
@stavvers @veidtlemania I'd much rather watch them say "That David Cameron deserves to have his head lopped off + planted on a spike."
@annajayne @annwitbrock There's not a perfect party on offer, from where I'm sitting. Oh well. There's a top 2 and I voted for them.
@BatgirlCass "And if so, do you plan to take over the world? Because I've made the calculations, I'm not sure I can ever be OK with that."
Responses to asexuality are funny. There are literally men out there seemingly thinking "But what if women don't want to have sex with me?"
@wittyretort77 @BlackGirlNerds Presumably doctors are called out to address those conditions, not, like, "being asexual."
@theOFFICIALmilf WAT? People are actually saying Straight should be in there?
@Gildy55 Demonizing the poor is nothing like stereotyping the rich, there's no ethical equivalent whatsoever.
I felt my body trying to choose between a panic attack or bursting into tears, but I've voted.
@caephyn Well, I would be all for it, but I doubt it's actually happening.
That's it I'm voting for #DogsAtPollingStations.
Use hashtag #PolledO…
Don't disappoint him! 
#VoteLabour 
#LabourMustWin 

Don't vote Tory. Please. My life mostly likely depends on it.
@LUBOttom @debecca Regardless of what I do, the idea of showing Facebook my ID has me nopeing in every direction.
@debecca @LUBOttom Although I shouldn't have to really. *sigh*
@debecca @LUBOttom I've been wondering about changing my name legally anyway so this might've pushed it slightly up in my priority list.
@LUBOttom @debecca ...but tbh I don't have the spoons right now so I'm using it as an opportunity for a forced break.
@LUBOttom @debecca Yup. The dreaded anti-trans "real names" policy. They're demanding to see my ID. There are hoops I can jump through...
@debecca @LUBOttom If I can be a support to either of you in any way, just shout. I've been booted off Facebook so not going anywhere, LOL x
@LUBOttom @debecca It's very much like that in our house. I wonder how many families can say the same? Someone should do the research!
@LUBOttom @debecca 33 since March 16th. I am sorry to hear about your son. Sometimes parenting/family is unimaginably hard. Solidarity. x
@debecca @LUBOttom Happy Birthday! 33 isn't all that bad, so far. x
@laurenlapkus Ah, are you referring to the wob wob wob bird? My favourite.
@netflix Also, "Because You Watched Nothing Good in the Last Month."
Speculative @netflix categories to think about: "Films That Had That One Scene In That I Liked", "Dogs In Peril", "Films Featuring Desks."
I wish voting out Tories didn't depend on pro-Labour hashtags. Nevertheless, we HAVE to vote out the Tories.
"Oi, I said Oi, what you looking at, you little rich boy?" One fine anti-Cameron anthem: 
I'm listening to The Levellers, music I loved before life became far too bloody complicated.
Right. I've picked a party to vote for, and I won't waver for self-preservation reasons. I just need less of this anxiety.
@chrissywilliams My election anxiety is NOT the same as Christmas Eve as-a-kid anxiety.
@lucmaxwell @isobelhaydock And pink?
VoteSwap | Labour and Green supporters swap votes to keep out the Tories 
@JW_Davidson Awesome! I do have my uses then ;) OK, so I just signed up to VoteSwap. No swaps available but I'm on a waiting list.
@JW_Davidson But, as for the former, so do all parties.
@JW_Davidson Well, specifically they have transphobes + they support assisted suicide, which I don't. So.
@kevstanley66 I've never been so terrified of an election result.
@JW_Davidson What's VoteSwap?
@JW_Davidson That's my instinct, too. I don't like everything about Green but well.
FWIW I'm not gonna take it away from anyone if they go for Labour or Green. What choice do we have?
@JW_Davidson Not a chance. It's very much a Tory stronghold. Or UKIP, God forbid.
Maybe I'm not even worried about tomorrow. Maybe my anxiety is: What will I do if the Tories stay in? The dread is palpable.
just don't vote T…
@OneNightStanzas Yeah, it's awful. Oh well. This time tomorrow it'll be done.
I'll probably vote for the first one on the paper. It's not as if it matters in my constituency. *sigh*
I'm still intellectually bouncing between Green and Labour. To be honest I'm beginning to freak out with anxiety.
@natalieciacchi @FedoraHippie No trans person has a choice.
#LRT Spot the irony. Are you miserable + hopeless? Get God's grace -- something you'll never ever deserve.

Yes, I also prefer NOT BREAKING MY WRIS…
"Ah, smelly feely touchy old books. Technology be damned!" &lt; ableism in literature
#LRT Are we still talking about books or... ? @pshares
@colintrevorrow Arg I'm so desperate to hear some of the music!
@matthewddsg Ouch. That they do. :(
Best thing about tomorrow: a shrunk friends' list. Because if you voted Tory or UKIP I don't want you.
@RainbowSerina So, ho hum. Anyway thanks. I will probably flip a coin for them or Labour, LOL.
@RainbowSerina Yeah. They want to stop NHS privatization + scrap the WCA too, which is good. But they support assisted suicide, which isn't.
@RainbowSerina OK, cool thanks.
@RainbowSerina I've only seen transphobia from the Greens tbh. Any other evidence you could point to or just a general feeling?
@AcademicAnge Nobody adequate to represent us, that's for certain. I wish I wasn't as worried about Green as I am.
@everyist There was a long journey full of trial and error in between.
How are my disabled + trans + otherwise marginalized UK friends voting? I still don't know. DM if you like.
Originality is overrated in music tbh. I just want good.
@everyist @JOANNAGRUESOME Tbh my taste has got a lot simpler. So yeah it's good. Refreshing.
@everyist @JOANNAGRUESOME It's a bit more naive and scrappy than some of the stuff I like. But the hooks are great.
@everyist @JOANNAGRUESOME Haha cool! I'm listening to their new album right now, enjoying it a lot.
Also @everyist, you may or may not like this band: 
So as it turns out, @JOANNAGRUESOME is a band I'm glad I heard for the first time today.
Me: To work out.
Taxi Driver: Oh you want to keep yourself fit? You want to be an actres…
Dudes of the Internet on AoE Black Widow criticism (or pretty much any criticism): "People need to calm down because I have an opinion."
@ambulancebox @facebook Nope. But to be honest I've got very little energy to jump through the hoops so I'm using it as a break opportunity.
@CassandraB ...pistachio ice cream. It just doesn't taste like pistachio.
@CassandraB It's annoying. I've got pistachio hot chocolate. It's OK because the favour is very subtle but it has the same issue as...
@MsVanillaRose Yeah, I don't really like almonds for this very reason. Although I think I'm OK with un-sugared almonds?
Like, just for once I would like my pistachio-flavoured product to taste like pistachio.
Why has the world decided that "pistachio" flavoured things are supposed to taste like marzipan?
@kevstanley66 @Lollardfish I'm planning on it, depending on spoons. :)
@kevstanley66 @Lollardfish Yep. Totally. I've run up against that tonnes of times.
@kevstanley66 @Lollardfish That's what I was thinking. It's important to not center everything around "the issue."
@kevstanley66 @Lollardfish It frustrates me because it would be SO easy to get this shit right. Just get like one or two deaf writers.
@Lollardfish @kevstanley66 "I saw this thing on TV... BUT WHY wouldn't she want to be cured?" etc.
@Lollardfish @kevstanley66 Same. And tbh I found it sorta realistic that some abled white guys would suddenly do that.
@Lollardfish @kevstanley66 The dad's approach: "What if...? Cure and cochlear impants" attitude is ham-fisted but important.
@isosame Yeah. Their ridiculous "real names" policy got me.
@Lollardfish Almost definitely. No bad thing. :)
@kevstanley66 @Lollardfish But as I say I'm only on episode 2.
@kevstanley66 @Lollardfish I'd be interested to know your thoughts. Two deaf / disabled actors is groundbreaking really.
@Lollardfish But I'm good with cheesy teen TV, so the tone is happy and optimistic and that's just fine.
@Lollardfish The most glaring contrivance was how relentlessly cheery the main character seems. But I'm sure that'll change.
@danileekelley Yes and yes. It reminds me of the Chupa Chups logo.
@Lollardfish I've just done 1 episode so far. I like it. The writing and acting is teeny + contrived, but the important stuff is fantastic.
Might watch more "Switched at Birth" tonight.
I'm #NotVotingUKIP because I would prefer a more leisurely demise.
I've changed my mind I'm voting Russell Brand.
Still have no idea how I'm voting on Thursday. Still just kind of terrified and depressed.
Any variation of "IDS has no clue what he's doing except for mercilessly killing the disabled" will scarcely raise my eyebrow at this point.
@TheMockneyRebel @Hammergts This isn't news. He'll come to the conclusion that anywhere is fine.
"EMERGENCY: Vote to Start Revolution!" Um, OK. I'm not expecting a revolution via vote, but I was always going to vote.
LOL so Russell Brand wants everyone to vote now?
@notwaving Yep every time. He actually said "Oh. I thought you'd had an injury or something."
@notwaving @hernamewaselrod Amazing that he trusts the collective intelligence of 1M atheist followers to speak for him. V. professional!
LOL the estate agent (looking at my wheelchair): "What have you been doing?" 

Me: "Being disabled."
@vikingfrog86 Basically they want them to match, and I can't.
@vikingfrog86 Yep, basically that. And also asked for my "real name" that I would be using for the account, or something.
 
@hernamewaselrod I reckon white supremacist patriarchal atheism likes to blame white supremacist patriarchal religion for the same problems.
@JurassicPark @AppStore I think they mean "Build the theme park of Trevorrow."
#LRT New TV spot. That wasn't the good-quality version I just saw but it's out there. So yay.
@zaranosaur Actually I think I recognize one character from Jane the Virgin? I'll have to confirm that but I think so.
@zaranosaur Just to warn you if that's not your thing.
@zaranosaur Yes that's where I've seen it. Tired now but I will definitely watch more tomorrow. It's really quite "teen" in tone by the way.
@amaditalks Definitely, same here. If I have any energy I'll use it up for raising the issue here I think. The break will do me good anyway.
@zaranosaur The leads are women, and there are Spanish-speaking women of colour too (Puerto Rican).
@zaranosaur Actually there are two deaf roles, I've yet to see how big a part the other one plays but I think it'll be significant.
@zaranosaur The acting + writing is soap opera-contrived but the disability stuff is really good. A disabled / deaf actor in a lead role.
So in terms of disability / deafness representation on TV, everyone should be talking about "Switched at Birth." I've just seen episode 1.
@amaditalks Ah no, you too? Thankyou, I appreciate it. I've been given one or two things to try but I need to wait for more energy I think.
"I think I had a brother, with brown hair, who used to tease me." #TheXFiles "Closure." I just watched it. Again. And yes I'm crying. Again.
@felixtension ...a few other lovely people have already tweeted at them for me. Luckily there's nothing pressing poetry-wise.
@felixtension Thank you. To be honest, I think I'll give it a break to calm down before I start trying to approach FB myself. But...
@paintarya OK. Phone's on charge. That sounds iffy but I will see. Thanks, whatever happens!
@paintarya Which I don't want to do, obvs. Also it seems to be implying I'll have to use my deadname for my account?
@paintarya OK. Atm it's just asking for me to supply my ID. :/
@queerdykekylie Thank you. Whatever you can do I would greatly appreciate. I guess they let you back on for some random reason u don't know?
@HydroAssoc @AANSNeuro What about self-advocacy?
@carlosornah @TaraFknChambler I'm just looking at him hoping he's OK to be honest. White guys can do this like every weekend.
@stillicides @bzzjosie Ah, now that I'm down with!
@stillicides @bzzjosie If nut allergies were split into hundreds of subcategories of nut allergy.
@ambulancebox I know that some people have managed to get back on. I'm just waiting to find out how I guess.
@ambulancebox ...then demands to see ID with our "real name" that "we'll be using on our profiles" on it.
@ambulancebox Yep. Unfortunately a lot of trans people have been facing this for I don't know how long now. Facebook boots us off, and...
Dear Facebook, my "real name" is "Fuck You."
Any idea what I have to do? I want to use my chosen name on Facebook. If I can't I'm just going to quit it tbh.
Funny that Facebook boots me off literally hours after I make a status which clarifies my gender identity and pronouns.
I am not "proving" my legal name for Facebook, showing them my dead name, or using it on my profile. *sigh*
@queerdykekylie So I've just been hit by the fucking "real names" policy on Facebook. I've been booted off. I have no idea what to do.
@SciPhiKat @ThommyH_H I get the reasons why it could be taken as appropriate metaphor. I also get the complaints. I need to see it myself.
The Fourth Awakens.
@AnnDrist 3. Me
@destieluk I saw this and thought of you x 
I want to go to a Jurassic World where instead of dinosaurs in the enclosures, you just had permission to cry.
My grandad died like 12 years ago and I still occasionally think "I wish he was here to see this."
So I hear Black Widow says a "70s-era sexist" line in Age Of Ultron about women who can't have babies being "monsters" or something?
So that's it. Cards. Table. Want education? Pay me. We can discuss rates, they'll be negotiable, because I'm a good person.
I think from now on I'm going to be a paid educator, or none. Abled cis people get to be "educators" for money + still abuse us.
Because the thing is, cis people aren't asking to be taught. They're asking to be presented with information that they can masturbate to.
The whole fucking point of my marginalization is that I can't say or do anything right, and you're complicit in that. Deal with it.
@NursieDear25 @mmaher70 @margueritahanco @wfimidlothian But Labour didn't begin Welfare Reform which turned Atos from ignorant to dangerous.
Can people who aren't marginalized or oppressed stop saying "We can't say or do anything right" as if that's not our whole life experience?
@m_giacchino I cannot WAIT to hear a preview. :D
Cis people, don't ask me to get into a long back-and-forth education session, and then disallow me every opportunity to get angry.
Me: "Thing is, if you think about it, it's really like this..." Them: "Maybe. I haven't thought about it and I'm not thinking about it now."
What are the chances that Zach and Gray will be as great as Tim and Lex? Slim to none?
I can't stop playing the Jurassic Park theme to myself for feels and comfort, and I'm not even sorry.
@BobMcBoint @latentexistence @chloemiriam And all without an ableist slur! You need to write a book called How To Insult People With Power.
@riotheatherrr Thank you :) And thanks for sharing it!
What are "Disability" and "Ableism" Anyway? (for Blogging Against Ableism Day, 2015) 
You can't include all "people who need abortions" by calling your campaign "Lady-Parts Justice." @LadyPJustice
@SarahKSilverman @LadyPJustice Just vaginas, or...?
I'm ridiculously excited to hear what @m_giacchino has in store for Jurassic World's score: 
It would make my month to read a cis feminist centre transmisogyny.
@AnaMardoll Usually people who moan about blocking as the highest sin imaginable are steeped in various privileges.
You know why #PaintYourNailsForBruce squicks me when it's lead by cis men (as I think it is)? Basically I detect a communal misgendering.
So I don't know, maybe some of you #PaintYourNailsForBruce dudes can get onto some of that? It's not all about looking fabulous.
While white cis guys are doing #PaintYourNailsForBruce there are Black trans women being killed by the police in Baltimore. Just FYI.
Cus guys can do #PaintYourNailsForBruce but when transfemmes post selfies we're called narcissists. How about dismantling that.
Dear cis guys, instead of #PaintYourNailsForBruce, maybe like consider donating to a local trans-supporting charity or gender clinic. *sigh*
Really could do with some Jurassic World in my life right now. Any chance of releasing it early @colintrevorrow?
@Thogar @Starbuck_Scully @GlenMrgn "Mulder + Scully’s relationship will not be in the same place we left it at end of the series." Say what?
#BringBackEllieSattler2K15
Kinda worried @JurassicPark is going to be "Bryce Dallas Howard eventually finds her warmth + humanity thanks to Chris Pratt's influence."
White people who are like "We're all human" but have to split protesters into categories of "well-meaning" and "criminal."
If I wasn't an activist, if I didn't tweet and status all this shit, I would just crumble under everything. I do it to stay OK, to survive.
Getting pretty tired of seeing Chris Pratt in the Jurassic World promotion. We know next to nothing about the other characters.
I woke up pretty under the weather. My hair is all over the place and I didn't even brush it. #SorryNotSorry
"Pirates aren't ableist, because peg legs + hooks!" "Jokes" like this are magnets for self-congratulatory ableism, you know that right?
@Auragasmic @CarsonDaly He's a white man, the only qualification he needs.
Prof. Stephen Hawking calls David Cameron a "right twat" on Twitter: 
The only qualification for Racist is Whiteness.
I don't often do much during my hours of insomnia, but when I do, it's crying.
@sarahlicity Well, Lib Dems failed hard to protect us so there's that.
@sarahlicity Which scientist? There's a history of eugenics where politics + science meet. He may be thinking primarily of disabled people.
And what the fuck can I do about any of it?
White people who just fist-bumped at 13 episodes of White masked vigilante on Netflix but call Baltimore protests "riots" + "violence." FML.
I hope the Indominus Rex calls out "Alan!" at some point in the Jurassic World movie.
@sarahnmoon Or to be polyamorous, tbh.
All oppressed bodies have been medicalized + pathologized at points throughout history. It's not inevitable for disability. Think beyond it.
Given the context of societal coercive gendering, "cisgendered" might be appropriate. "Transgendered" is not.
I am not my gender because of my body. I am my gender because society gendered/genders my body. I am transgender because I react/ed to that.
#LRT "As a cis gay man I (only) support cis gay men." Does your mother know?
#LRT Dude also simultaneously 1) denies trans gender people are valid because "biology, but 2) says "drag queens aren't transgender."
#LRT Dude has read one cis white gay dude say trans women aren't to thank for starting the Stonewall Riots + that's it for him.
@LulaVauss How did he not get the fucking memo about STONEWALL.
@redbubble is selling scarves for Mother's Day. Here's hoping they stick with that idea beyond Mother's Day
@uncooldana My faves are the other way round but I totally hear you.
Ironically they've gone with a very bright colour palette for Jurassic World (which I'm OK with) but the dinos are basically big grey blobs.
I guess it made me wish that we were getting very colourful dinosaurs for Jurassic World, even if I don't really care about feathers.
Can you "confirm" something "probably"? I don't know but you know what I mean. I guess there's still some uncertainty there.
So today I confirmed that Jurassic Park 3 is easily the worst in the franchise but it probably has my favourite raptor design.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy No, that's fine. I do know what you mean, was just a caution.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy Not because it couldn't, but because nobody has allowed it to as nobody is familiar with hydro,
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy I have a hunch that "neurotypical" is too broad because it doesn't include ppl with hydrocephalus either.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy Therapy doesn't work for all mental health problems, but that's beside the point I'm making anyway.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy When they do that, I feel implicated in the power Autism Speaks has + I don't possess that power.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy No, I'm not. I'm talking about ppl making jokes like "Allism Speaks" to satirically attack Autism Speaks.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy "Neurotypical" is absolutely fine for most activist purposes + especially to locate the privilege group.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy I'm not sure you're getting this, to be honest.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy ...those with abusive systemic power over autistic people.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy Of course there are. But that doesn't mean I don't feel shit on when someone uses "allistic" to refer to..
@AceEye4TheNBGuy @theoriesofminds As a person with hydrocephalus I am similarly oppressed alongside autistic people but also allistic.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy @theoriesofminds But cis people have oppressive privilege over trans people. "Allistic" as a whole group do not.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy But therapy isn't effective against hydrocephalus either. It's a neurological developmental disability.
@theoriesofminds @AceEye4TheNBGuy I'm talking about words we should be using for "the other side", so to speak.

I totally understand + don't want to diminish autistic anger but be careful not to attribute structural power to autistic cousins with none.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy ...so that I'm not carelessly saying that everyone who can walk has privilege over me or is abusive to me. That's not true.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy But other than that, I'm just not sure what the point is. I'm in a wheelchair. I've changed my language as an activist...
@AceEye4TheNBGuy OK, "allistic" can be used to talk about symptoms + traits which are unique to autism + neurotypical parents might use it.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy When you're talking about an oppressive system that is abusive towards autistic ppl, ppl with hydro should not be included.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy People with hydrocephalus don't have neurotypical privilege though.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy If we want to talk about the system of neurotypicality which wants us all cured or killed could we be using "neurotypical"?
@AceEye4TheNBGuy Right. Which is why I find it triggering to constantly read about "allistic privilege" + "allism" as an oppressive system.
For activist purposes, what does the word "allistic" do that "neurotypical" doesn't? Genuine question.
TFW you have the option of dismissing someone's few slightly dodgy views as "controversial" but ah well no one's perfect.
"But I've spent DECADES being a knight in shining armour for trans people!" That's a lot of decades to undo.
I'm not going to forgive someone's views that are harmful to me just because you like most of their views on other people. I don't care.
If I share "This man is transphobic" can you not reply with "I like him but [soft generic critique]". You've just co-signed his transphobia.

@colintrevorrow favourited one of my tweets!!!
Katie Hopkins is to the UK what the Indominus Rex is to Jurassic World.
I just re-watched Jurassic Park 3. For fun. What is my life? Best part: a raptor, on a plane, shouting "Alan!"

Thank you.
Love,

#helenswriting #ScrapWCA  #GE15 
@AnathemaJane @colintrevorrow This joke has legs. Tall, wide, long-clawed legs. With feathers.
My biggest complaint about Jurassic World so far is that @colintrevorrow doesn't have feathers.
I sorta cried my eyes out trying to decide what to wear to my date tonight. That's never happened before. I used to just KNOW, you know? :/
@everyist This was a good read. The tangled web of Marvel Universe cross-referencing is beginning to give me a headache though.
@everyist @riffraffatlaw It's pretty freaky so that's nice. But I wasn't sure if I was looking at The Joker or a second-rate Marilyn Manson.
Bruce Jenner's wealth, status + safety won't "trickle down" to ordinary trans women. But misgendering + transmisogyny towards her will.
Dropping stuff about David Cameron on my wall uninvited triggers me. Please don't do it.
Oh you know, don't mind me, I'm just muting Foggy Nelson hate.
I'm the kind of dinosaur they cooked up in that lab.
How about "meh" and "meme" as pronouns.

So yeah, I'm kind of tired of people who aren't trans women telling me which trans women I'm allowed to feel represented or empowered by.
Jurassic Park is my happy place. If I don't get some nuanced + proactive female characters I'm gonna go all I-Rex on @colintrevorrow's ass.
OK I'm gonna say it: I just saw a new @JurassicPark clip with Lauren Lapkus. But she's not doing anything. Is that how this is going to be?
@LulaVauss @FedoraHippie "nonviolence" or the defense of oppressive power amirite?
#WhatILoveAboutUKIP Absolutely ever-loving fuck all.
You know White Supremacy's a thing when Adam Sandler says "No career to speak of. I know, I'll make a massively racist movie, that'll work."
Trans people don't transition to become their genders. They ARE their genders.
@TheeMaryWalker @FedoraHippie RT if u think Bruce Jenner IS a hot woman. *tumbleweed*
@nanayasleeps That's gone beyond speaking for themselves. AFAB people don't know what trans womanhood is like.
@nanayasleeps Well, quite. And not if they're arguing with a trans woman about expectations and standards placed on trans women.
@nanayasleeps I meant trans men really. Claiming to know and defend womanhood when it's intellectually convenient to do so.
@helen_bleep @DickPatriarchy There is also TWEF: Trans Women-Exclusionary "Feminist."
@helen_bleep @DickPatriarchy I fucking love snoods. I love snoods probably more than dinosaurs.
@helen_bleep @DickPatriarchy The assumption of privilege / misgendering in this fallacy that we can somehow ruin things for cis women.
The privilege of cis women + AFAB trans people who are bored of femininity deciding that they're just as bored of us doing it.
@stillicides I mean, hell, I totally support AFAB people wearing bow ties. Knock yourselves out. But fuck it, I'm wearing splashes of pink.
@nanayasleeps There is no nuance. Stop. Policing. Trans women.
@nanayasleeps Men + masculine ppl expect me to want to have "nuanced" conversations about this forever on Facebook without getting angry.
It's extraordinarily frustrating, and more of the hideous trap that all women find themselves in.
So I'm gonna go totally "dapperqueer" and be gendered as a man forever. Radical.
While we're at it, you do realise that when I go "neutral" / "androgynous", it's just called "menswear"... right? But fine.
I mean you're right, we have no right to pander to YOUR cis "status quo" by trying to look beautiful. Ever. That's so retrograde right? Ugh.
These comments policing the aesthetic choices of trans women make me want to stop shopping + wear jeans + lumberjack shirts forever, fyi.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy I am absolutely done trying to explain to cis women why trans women's aesthetic choices are not the same thing.
If we could just stop accusing trans women of buying into capitalist / consumerist cis beauty standards + the male gaze, that would be nice.
So I hear Chris Evans has been engaging in some "70's-era sexism."
@AceEye4TheNBGuy Trans men are men. This one has gross male values + is vying to be included in a gross lads' mag.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy I do hold one in higher esteem than the other. :)
Why am I not shocked Aydian Dowling's potential Men's Health modelling has been shared + celebrated more than Laverne Cox's nude photoshoot?
Trans women are real women. Transmisogyny is real misogyny.
Great to see poets retweeting our Call for Submissions for a UK anthology of intersectional Disability Poetics! 
#LRT Yeah but apparently trans women can't be accepted as "real women" until all our narratives + issues are the same as cis women's.
@RozKaveney @caephyn Can we just not tell other people what they are or aren't supposed to be angry about?
LOL u know that forgiving people not 7 but 77 times thing? Ask marginalised people how far they've surpassed that; that's why they're angry.
@Lizbeth_City "Of COURSE I'm an ally + want to help with your cause, as long as you never get angry at me."
@Lizbeth_City And in my experience, more often than not they do walk away... at the earliest opportunity.
@SciPhiKat I probably couldn't find it again but it was one of probably thousands that had "Say Something" playing behind it.
The thing about being an "ally" is you have the privilege of being able to throw in the towel whenever you want. Trans + disabled ppl don't.
All my life, my ideas that come from my worldview + perspective have been brushed off as "fascinating" or "interesting" but ultimately nope.
I've heard a lot about "conversion" + "renewing your mind", but not once have I ever been able 2 convert a Christian to my thoughts + ideas.
@colintrevorrow confirmed the Jurassic World gates wouldn't be CGI in the movie. I wonder what else will be replaced with practical effects?
@zaranosaur Oh, absolutely! Sorry if you felt I was undermining that.
@FedoraHippie @SalonOgraphy Worst publicity stunt eva, LOL.
@zaranosaur I guess I'm just saying that I'm tired of "playing ball" by their rules, so to speak. But that's just my journey.
@w00shie If you ever liked Blur, then definitely yes.
I'm quite amazed at how good this Blur album is after so long, you know.
@zaranosaur Good point. If you have the spoons to formulate arguments which cover all bases, that's a great thing.
@zaranosaur Are you sure they're not just swerving the issue? "OK I'll accept this but only if I don't have to accept this."
So I just cried over a pretty bad Mulder + Scully fan video.
Somebody please direct me to the feminist faction of the Jurassic World fandom I want to read speculation on something other than dinosaurs.
So you think you're contributing positively to social justice by calling that oppressor of yours a "retard"? GTFO.
Currently streaming the new Blur album. YES.
FYI transfeminine ppl have every right to be uninterested in Aydian Dowling fronting Men's Health. Cis ppl have no right to police us on it.
@MargoJMilne @eccentricman87 I think this term IS appropriation. That's my view. Wish we had a different word for our equivalent phenomenon.
@MargoJMilne @eccentricman87 Besides, "blacking up" DOES still happen. Ever seen Tropic Thunder?
@MargoJMilne @eccentricman87 I don't like "cripping up" as a phrase that borrows from "blacking up." They don't share a history.
@Lollardfish Absolutely.
Yes, SKINNER WILL BE BACK: 
@Lollardfish Thanks for writing this! We have different perspectives on Scope's campaign but that's OK; it's appropriate for this piece.
A great article by @Lollardfish exploring how successfully @Daredevil depicts "everyday disability" + why it matters: 
@colintrevorrow The delivery of the "She's killing for sport" line has sounded off in every trailer to me. That said, overall this is great.
#LRT My only disappointment is that we still haven't heard John Williams' score theme.
#LRT Well, that was the best Jurassic World trailer yet. Of course we all know it's going to be OTT ridiculous, but it sure looks great fun.
Daredevil is *actually blind*. @Lollardfish gives us a needed reminder: 
As a kid I was repeatedly told I could fit rocket boosters to my chair + my crutches would make great laser guns. I'm 33 + it still happens.
Can we not make jokes about wheelchairs or other mobility aids? Physically disabled people are human beings not "Wacky Races" characters.
@ablegirl I don't want to say "Hydrocephalus causes anger problems" because it doesn't always + sometimes neurotypicality does.
@ablegirl Well, so can anyone. But irritability can be a part of various neurological disabilities.
@ablegirl Both things are possible yes. Stress can make symptoms more pronounced. Increased sensitivity to stimuli can cause anger / temper.
TFW somebody tweets you something, then it disappears and doesn't turn up in your notifications. *sigh*
What I REALLY want from today's Jurassic World trailer is to hear the music.
"Look that man is about to punch me in the face, somebody stop him!"

"I disagree."
Why is it that most of the UK public only recognises Katie Hopkins' oppressive attitudes when Katie Hopkins expresses them?
Tweeps, the new Alabama Shakes album! You are welcome.
TFW people make you responsible and guilty for your anger at their ableism.
I am done with turning up to everyone else's SJ campaign and then finding out disabled people are excluded from theirs.
Just fed up of this faux-"compassion" for Conservative voters to be honest. Just say what you mean: they are scum.
@PaulbernalUK "Only in a strictly financial sense" is pretty much everything when you're poor + disabled. Rich people aren't "miserable."
@PaulbernalUK Why? Conservatives exist to reward the most privileged people in society. He is probably doing absolutely fine in every way.
Why would you assume that someone boasting about voting Conservative must have a miserable life? I think people aren't getting something.
@PaulbernalUK Actually his life is almost certainly absolutely amazing if he can afford to vote Conservative with a smile on his face.

@sarahnmoon I wish we could. I wish it wasn't too exhausting.
Transfeminism is a tough + triggering task to be involved in. Any transfemmes involved in it, I salute you. You are strong as fuck.
I remember the first time I heard "The cuts are affecting ALL of us not just disabled ppl" +didn't understand why it made me rage. Activism!
@zaranosaur Right back at you. I'm sure I'm just one of many who are ridiculously glad that you're on Twitter.
@colintrevorrow The Big Question: Is that mosasaurus *supposed to be* ridiculously over-large for the story?
Cis women: your "damned if we do, damned if we don't" is NOT the same thing as trans women's "Damned either way." You don't get misgendered.
Why can't a trans woman ever express sadness at not "passing" without a cis woman replying "We're always told we're doing it wrong too!"?
@BendyGirl @WOWpetition Maybe we should travel in our wheelchairs to tell her what her support of the Tories is doing to us ;)
@Shannonemurray She obviously supports the Tories and everything they stand for. That's enough in my book.
@Shannonemurray Money.
Closely related to telling an ableist joke: interpreting something someone else said as an ableist joke because the subject is disability.
@hermesgypsy Ha, I'm glad you think so. *bows*
How can we more effectively crack down on internet microaggression towards neurodivergent people? Any ideas?
"Maybe the answer is somewhere in the middle." 
What if the quote was: "Fear is a path out of oppression. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to self-love + empowerment."
Because I don't see any of them allowing the persecuted + oppressed the right to be intolerant of, or hateful towards, their oppressors.
How much is "tolerance" rhetoric -- or its more emphatic cousin, "anti-hate" rhetoric -- just the privileged patting themselves on the back?
@DervlaJM This is never OK. I am sorry :(
I got some pistachios in the end. Sweet, sweet pistachios, how I love thee.
Do I want to go out and get some chocolate? If so, what kind of chocolate? Human things.
@jurassicparkiv Oh goody, another poster.
@commentisfree @havantacluOTMP @DrBrianMay "I believe there are good, decent MPs in every party." Of course he does, privileged dipshit.
Me and my beloved Jurassic Park franchise have a complicated relationship right now, and I'm not happy about having to say it.
I'm not even that excited about Star Wars + yesterday's trailer made me go HOLY SHIT THAT'S STAR WARS. Come on, Jurassic World.
The wait for Jurassic World news is ridiculous. Under 2 months away + we've only had 1 very average full-length trailer with unfinished FX.
@Pasunepomme @AthertonKD I'm sitting here like "WAT that might've just made my day."
The cars
That were in your

Forgive me
They were

Just went to town in my demigirl T-shirt for the first time with no jacket to cover it up. Terrifying actually but now I could do it again.

@EmilyHasler YES!

Thanks, @netflix, for responding to disabled + deaf people's requests for audio descriptions on @Daredevil. 
@chloemiriam @HideousHillary @cdaargh That tweet of mine's being hanging around since October 13 and I still haven't been paid.
So now that he's spoken out against its "70's-era sexism", every time I Google "Jurassic World", I get a picture of Joss Whedon's face.
Why can I never get my OneDrive window to close? Any idea?
Don't vote Tory or UKIP. OK? That's all I can manage in terms of UK election activisting. It's too triggering + I've moved on.
@agoraphobicgeek @pccasestudy @Lexialex I think they need a woman who will communicate any message she damn well likes.
@Lexialex Unless men score the points, in which case it's great right?

Yeah, that's what I thought.
"I just find your style of activism alienating." OK, well tell me what aspects of my subjects you were interested in before I alienated you.
@Lexialex LOL gratuitous violence + gore is awesome but feminism "scares men away."
@skeptic562000 @FedoraHippie You just lost all credibility. This conversation is now just name-calling + insults.
Sometimes you only have to write one single post to a cis man before he says you've "lost all credibility."
@FedoraHippie @skeptic562000 Pffft. He's a white cis man. His opinion matters by default, obviously?!
@skeptic562000 @FedoraHippie You. Definitely you.
@FedoraHippie @skeptic562000 Also, you know before you "lost all credibility", how much did you have in this dude's mind? Out of 10?
@FedoraHippie @skeptic562000 This white cis guy is just really surprising me with his "skeptical" opinions. They're really refreshing.
@FedoraHippie @skeptic562000 Maybe sharks and Metal are more his thing.
@FedoraHippie @skeptic562000 Isn't it weird how a cis white dude thinks a trans person has no credibility? So fucking weird.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr Oops sorry! Not much of a spoiler though hopefully.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr Agreed. I love Mark Waid's thought balloons but he also uses the "radar." Whatevs.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr Absolutely. One of my favourite scenes was when he followed the guy by the ticking of his watch.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr I will be disappointed if they start to use it in a bigger budget season 2.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr Exactly. I *sorta* understand they have to do that in the comic panels but glad the TV show didn't use it.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr Which is good because if he's blind, I didn't want any visual powers interfering that. He "sees" with other senses.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr I agree with you. I particularly liked the auditory sonar. What I'm saying is they played down any visual "radar."
@FedoraHippie @Cherri2290 @lilisamarieb Whitni, if a trans person says a joke is transphobic, sit down + listen.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr Even the "compensatory senses." I know it's an ableist trope but like how they really played it down in the series.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr ...world's very first disabled superhero. Yes I'm going to enjoy that + not going to ignore it like everyone.else.
@d_m_elms @riotheatherrr I'm pretty damn concerned, usually. There was no excuse for The Theory of Everything. But DD is basically the...
@the_author_ @Auragasmic What does it look like to "harass" a Gamergater: "Excuse me, can you please stop that? I don't like it."
@Auragasmic LOL every time I read "apolitical" it makes me want to tear my hair out.
You say I'm a hypocrite for wanting disabled actors to play disabled characters + then enjoying Daredevil? Tough shit. I reserve that right.
Daredevil spoiler:

Ugh I'm really not OK that they killed off Ben Urich. Why was this show such a frustratingly mixed bag? #Daredevil.
@destieluk I love you &lt;3
Someone hates on transgender people irl and people get murdered
The penis is not the location or source of power for trans women + transfeminine people that it is for cis men. It's why they are attacked.
Cis women saying "penis = violence" + "vagina = oppression" are ignoring trans women murdered for what they possess, not what they lack.
The other thing I need to say is that "Reproductive Health" = / = "Sex." Science does not + never did necessitate any gender binary.
If you can just point to your penis or vagina as a cis person + say "I am who I am because THIS", you can be forgiven for all sorts of crap.
Why is it hard being told that? Maybe because it forces you to think harder about what exactly defines you: biases, problematic behaviours.
It's so hard to say all this because cis men + women just hate being told their penis / vagina doesn't define their manhood / womanhood.
If you're trans + someone refuses to use your chosen name/pronouns, they're telling you they just *have* to define you by your genitals, OK?
Penis =/= male. Vagina =/= female. It's hard to live in the world saying "biological sex" doesn't exist, but that's what we're doing.
That's literally all it means to be trans. Nothing else: no HRT or surgery makes you more trans. The lack of it doesn't make you less trans.
A trans person is someone who doesn't agree with or identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. A cis person is someone who does.
Stop saying "gender" + "sex" are different. Reach back into history. At birth, they assigned a gender to your genitals. "Sex" = not real.
@jurassicparkiv @Brycenator100 OMG it's like you knew how depressed I was tonight and came to save me.
Can ppl stop calling transness a "birth defect"? I have Spina bifida. That's a birth defect. I also have Hydrocephalus. So's that. K thanks.
Do not like the gender feels I'm having today, and I don't even know how to explain them to myself let alone anyone else.
@AceEye4TheNBGuy It's OK I didn't think it was that at all. I tend to favourite things for solidarity reasons too.
Why yes please, I would love a plate of head fog with a side of dysphoria. Sounds as good as bangers and mash.
@Lollardfish Depending on what else I've got on, that would be fun. :)
@Lollardfish Excellent, look forward to it. I think I'd need to watch them all again, but it'd be an emotional onslaught I'm not ready for!
I hope that when the buzz is over we'll get some @Daredevil reviews which admit to its mistakes.
@RealAvocadoFact @littlechicken "Best damn avocados." #Daredevil
@Pasunepomme @destieluk @xceteras All fair, true criticisms. I keep saying to Sarah "I'm not going to defend that. Or that. Or that either."
@destieluk @Pasunepomme @xceteras Meeting Claire in ep2 was awesome + nuanced. Every other time she + DD have met the script was about love.
"Why are you criticizing Christianity for being homophobic when other people are homophobic as well?" -- Christians
@kiwinerd Skyler is awesome, though.
@BathysphereHat Absolutely. It's that condescending rescuer / saviour complex.
@BathysphereHat I've got this when complaining about the same thing, even as a male-read wheelchair user.
I guess the kindest thing I can say about #Daredevil is that there are things I didn't like about it but I still want to watch it again.
Thou shalt not try to convert gay people into being straight. Thou shalt convert yourselves into not …
@HylomantisL Let me join everything in telling you to watch this. It has potential to be great. As it is, it's really good.
"Fans to @netflix: Make @Daredevil Accessible to the Blind." Very glad this issue is getting coverage: 
Seeing #Daredevil in the red suit was amazing. But I was caught between happiness + disappointment that I had to wait for so long.
Also, season 2 of #Daredevil needs more Rosario Dawson but less underdeveloped romance, please @netflix.
Does anyone want to join me in the Foggy Nelson appreciation club? It's pretty lonely. #Daredevil.
@denofgeek This is what they replaced "In The Flesh" with? Maori exotification, hallucinogenic drugs + "getting laid" -- "for teens"? Eesh.
@SsRP5 @sarahlicity @Your_pet_meow @vex0rian @BootlegGirl What happens if you replace all these words with "bacon"?
We need to talk about how Stick is an abusive asshole who taught Matt some shitty medical-model self-denial shit. #Daredevil.
@_peech I cringed at this too, and so early on in the series. Ugh.
@kevstanley66 Let me know when you finish and I'd love to chat about it. :)
OK so I just finished #Daredevil! Overall impression: good, sometimes very good, with a list of disappointments + areas to improve on in s2.
I've been thinking for a while that #Daredevil could have been edited down to 10 episodes and it would've been consistently brilliant.
Episode 11 = seriously mixed bag of awesome + fluff. More than ever, I'd love a season 2, but I'd also like a better editor. #Daredevil.
@Mental_Image It's OK :) I'm OK. I'm still learning to cut it off before it becomes scary.
@Mental_Image The one I'm referring to basically wanted a private space to cisplain at me without public backlash.
@Mental_Image Some I felt that about, so I accepted. But I had to feel that the person was safe first. If I've just "met" them it's creepy.
Why are "trans allies" always asking if they can PM you to talk everything over?
Joining chorus of folks saying @netflix FAILED by excluding blind fans of @Daredevil. Where are the audio descriptions?? #DaredevilDVP
@kevstanley66 @RebeccaCokley @Lollardfish @LeadOnUpdate @SFdirewolf @AndrewPulrang It's good. Not perfect, but well worth a watch.
Oh by the way I've just finished episode 10. I'll watch the final 3 tomorrow. Can't WAIT to see the suit. #Daredevil.
I'm going to bed soon but had a FANTASTIC day watching + tweeting #Daredevil. My disability observations are on my TL mixed with silly crap.
@xceteras I mean, as well as a lot of reds being used.
@xceteras I actually really like that. There's this big use of blood, and the yellow / green says gross clinical things + fluids to me too.
@Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @LeadOnUpdate @SFdirewolf @AndrewPulrang Well, I've live tweeted a few observations, but not all 10 episodes. :)
It's just a shame Matt couldn't have become expert in Social Model of Disability as well as Law. Some bullshit philosophy there. #Daredevil
So at this point the show isn't without ableist cliches. But it could be a LOT worse. At least Stick is a douchebag in general. #Daredevil.
Loved + loathed episode 10 "Nelson v. Murdock" in equal measure. "Stick told me that my blindness wasn't a disability..." Urgh. #Daredevil.
Trigger Warning for implied / heard off-screen domestic violence in episode 8. #Daredevil
"The Man Without Fear" will now officially translate in my head to "The Man Alive Thanks To Rosario Dawson."
People on my feed (no pun intended) are talking about chicken and waffles. I have never had those together but I want to have them together.
@everyist I think you're going to like Wilson Fisk.
@everyist Also, I really like Foggy Nelson + I think he was cast well (at least visually) but his acting improves after episode 1, for sure.
@everyist Overall I don't mind it.
@everyist OK, I will say there are some overlong scenes that could've been cut much tighter. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.
Just came to the worst blindness conversation so far. Disappointing. It doesn't involve DD so whatevs but still cheesy ableism. #Daredevil
@SciPhiKat She is brilliant.
@everyist This is obviously a very Frank Miller + Bendis / Maleev DD. I could have done with more Mark Waid + Kevin Smith but fine.
@SciPhiKat I'm enjoying it a lot. It isn't *perfect*, at this point I have a few complaints but WAY better than the Ben Affleck monstrosity.
@SciPhiKat I'm going to rewatch it at some point after I've finished Daredevil.
@everyist You can tell me what you didn't like about it but possibly not today as I might have an averse emotional reaction to your opinion.
@everyist Oh Jorge. *sigh*
@outofmyplanet I'm already 5 episodes in LOL, I need to stop myself.
@Lollardfish Full disclosure that I'm an unapologetic fan, so I wouldn't take away someone's right to vehemently disagree with me.
@Lollardfish They've made much more of his hearing and smell etc.
@Lollardfish ...it's not spoonfed to you that either of these are *meant* to represent exactly what he's perceiving.
@Lollardfish "There are other ways to see" is the only line that's alluded to it so far. And there are some blurry camera shots etc. but...
@Lollardfish Some people might interpret it that way as some of the comics do (sadly), but evidence is thin on the ground. So far.

@Lollardfish I like that they've been very vague about his "compensatory senses", and they're mostly auditory. No visual "radar" sense.
@Lollardfish If I'd felt the portrayal of blindness was awful, that would've thrown me out of the show from the beginning.
@Lollardfish And I feel his relationships seem fairly natural. Only one slightly cheesy line so far but it's forgivable.
@Lollardfish I tweeted an article a bit ago by the consultant he worked with to learn his role as a blind person. Glad that was publicised.
@Lollardfish Yes I've watched 5 episodes now. The actor's not blind but as far as I know (not being blind myself) he seems to be doing well.
Batman &lt; @Daredevil (sorry not sorry).
Correction: Trigger Warning a scene of implied violence / threat against Rosario Dawson's character in episode 4. #Daredevil
#Daredevil is suitably brutal. Of course. I love it though. Also, Rosario fucking Dawson! Onto episode 3.
HAHAHA episode 1 of #Daredevil down, it's fairly amaze.
HERE I GO, #Daredevil is happening. 
@Daredevil Excited is not even the word.
@Lumetian @Chris_TOMP I am about to start this very, very soon!
@destieluk @qwertee @everyist &lt;3
Ugh dudes talking loudly outside my house late at night forever MAKE IT STOP.
"Beautiful Crime" by Tamer, used in the @Daredevil trailer (which I'm assuming is also the theme of the show): 
I even like the DD song, WTF I am going to die of excitement.
#LRT Nobody else is excited about the long-awaited reveal of Daredevil's red suit.
#LRT IT'S THE RED SUIT I MAY BE A LITTLE EXCITED.

Oh you "don't believe in labels"? Even the ones you say silently in your head when I wheel into the room? Do they help you figure me out?
I just remembered the time I spent about 5 minutes as a trans ally before realising I was trans.
@san_alland @applewriter Haha, I could probably get this done. I will investigate.
"What is this feeling, so sudden and new?"
TFW a friend uses the word "retarded" to insult Katie Hopkins for her attacks on mentally ill ppl. Thanks, bro. Do you just never read me?
@w00shie @IslaBoag @MargoJMilne @cdaargh She's one of the reasons I literally haven't watched the telly for 2 years.
@IslaBoag @MargoJMilne @cdaargh I'm not at all surprised.
Why do cis people constantly feel the need to speculate the motives of people who kill trans women, as if some motives would be fine?
My brain is so fucked right now and I don't know how to unfuck it.
The only disability in life is a bad platitude.
#LRT  In fact, maybe it's time that "allistic privilege" goes the way of "binary privilege." In the bin.
#LRT To reiterate: I know there are uses for the word "allistic", in discourse and analysis. But "Allism Speaks" is a joke that shits on us.
#LRT Ppl with hydrocephalus are neurodiverse but not generally autistic, therefore "allistic." Don't let your satire throw us under the bus.
@StephenDrakeNDY Thanks for this piece. As someone who has laughed at this satire when the word "neurotypical" was used, I'm with you.
"Trans people, don't change your body, God never makes mistakes."
"Disabled people, change your broken body, God wants to heal you."
@nanayasleeps @caephyn Anyone would think they just don't want us to be ourselves or something.
@nanayasleeps @caephyn Funny how any changes to the body are "unnatural" if you're trans but if you're disabled they want to heal/ cure you.
The abled white male "working class" + its rhetoric has classically / historically ignored us in this country. We are coded an underclass.
Don't tell me the only hope I have of winning any rights as a disabled person is by organising with "the working class" as a group.
If your "worker's rights" socialism doesn't incorporate the right of disabled people who can't work not to work, it doesn't interest me.
@UberFacts @FedoraHippie You mean "is a trans woman"?
@yakityyakblah @Enchanta_J @Quinnae_Moon @occupythemob Jared, white people *are* above the status quo.
THANK YOU!

@theoriesofminds Related to and visually resembling Pachycephalosaurus, but much more grumpy and with a powerful bite.
New Twitter handle. I think this one can stay, folks. RAWR.
Ultimately, all of this is about the fact that society won't let non-men self-determine and assert their own identity.
OK now I feel sick.
Currently eating a Lindt bunny.
If you're not familiar with the disability language I use, maybe I wasn't talking to you.
@engineer_cat Ugh cis people don't understand that we didn't just get a personality transplant. We are the same people / gender as ever.
@engineer_cat I can just imagine it: "This is Katie. Katie didn't always go by that name." *cuts to emotional life montage*
@engineer_cat OMG I hadn't heard about this. It's going to suck :(
This, of course, is not my fault. It's yours, because what you said was bullshit.
I've pretty much reached a point on social media where you should probably just not talk to me as I'll find a way of seeing it as bullshit.
I'd rather run them over half the time, tbh.
And do you know what's hilarious? The idea that I, as a wheelchair-user, am trying to *keep* any fucking non-disabled person on their toes.
5 minutes after waking I read that I "like to keep people on their toes" by using disability words+ "Everyone is somewhere on the spectrum."
Thing is, if non-disabled + neurotypical people can't get us to be just like them, they'll try to say they're just like us. Every time.
Seriously, non-disabled + neurotypical people need to stop thinking they get an honourary space in this life just by being a "nice" person.
It's neither encouraging nor accurate to tell people "Everyone's disabled in a way" or "Everyone is on the spectrum somewhere." Don't.
@disabledroyalty @BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley Often "disability" tends to default to White Middle-class.
@disabledroyalty @BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley Crits about for example, representation of other oppressed groups.
@disabledroyalty @BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley ...to disabled Twitter users' criticisms (there are lots of us).
@disabledroyalty @BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley Thanks for replying. For me it depends how responsive you are...
@BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @disabledroyalty Looks like anyone can send contributions in.
@BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @disabledroyalty I just followed. What's the potential gripe: title? Aims of group?
Just saw Residue, ep1. Netflix original I guess? First I was like, moody, nicely shot, a little overwrought  Then I was like WTF is this?!
@BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @disabledroyalty I mean, nobody else is celebrating us. Let's celebrate us.
@BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @disabledroyalty ...be celebrated in themselves.
@BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @disabledroyalty ...influenced, but that doesn't mean disabled figures shouldn't...
@BathysphereHat @HGGolightly @Lollardfish @RebeccaCokley @disabledroyalty I don't know what it's about, but I guess it's hegemonically...
How come I can watch "Crocodile Hunter: Crash Course" the movie, but not the "Crocodile Hunter" TV show. Sort it out, Netflix.
I need a holiday complete with a huge amount of spending money.
@Chris_TOMP @Daredevil ...Murdock a little arrogantly, interesting because one of the things I like about him is humility + almost shyness.
@Chris_TOMP @Daredevil Judging by the reviews it's a fairly safe bet that it will be good, I'd say. One review said that Cox plays...
@Chris_TOMP @Daredevil Yesterday's trailers were BRILLIANT, weren't they?
Oh yes, brain fatigue is otherwise known as brain fog. This has been me the past few days: 
Is there such a thing as brain fatigue? I think I have it. I can't people right now.
@Karnythia @rejectnation Isn't this question basically "Who said abled cis het white men weren't allowed to do everything?"
Sometimes I think being an ally to me must be like playing a video game. They LOVE IT. How far can I get before the Boss bites my head off?
My new web presence is "fucking scum of the earth."
I am sorry I'm so friendly because then I have to be sorry that I'm not friendly enough.
I've spent 3 years placating allies, thinking they're learning, but then just waiting for them to shit on me again. When do I get free?
OH SUCK *LA LA LA LA LA LA LA*
I'm in a Queen Adreena kind of mood, brb.
I do not exist to change the world for cis people. I do not exist to make it easier for cis people to "be themselves." This is not for you.
Or weren't you planning on taking your little cis thought experiment that far? No, I didn't think so.
So tell you what. Next time you think "Everyone should use they", drop ur cis woman "she" + write a fucking coming out article to the world.
Why? Because I don't see you going through the pain + embarrassment of daily coming out as trans + publicly chaning YOUR pronouns.
You tell me "Everyone should use "they" because you think my pronoun means nothing + it should merely be a default for everyone. Fuck off.
Cis people, why not just fuck off and leave me alone? I think everyone should fuck off and leave me alone.
Cis woman's response after I changed my pronoun to "She" on FB as an NB: "Why not just use "they"? I think everyone should use "they"."
@whedonworship @EverydaySexism Because all political parties assume that abled white cis het men are the centre of the universe.
I really hope they make a lot of Rosario Dawson's character. I don't know if they can considering her role. We'll see. *hopes*
Also, Foggy Nelson? How amazing is he going to be? He's perfect.
BUT IT'S FINE I'll give the angry white male vigilante a pass this time because YAY, Daredevil is being done properly.
Although I sometimes wonder how feminists would've trained up little Matt Murdock and whether I would've enjoyed the show more.
Daredevil full trailers 3 and 4. THESE ARE SO GOOD AND I'M SO EXCITED. 
@RadicalEmu I mean the guy playing Daredevil.
Maybe I do crush on Charlie Cox a little bit, so what?
The only reason nobody kicked the shit out of me for being queer is that I was already a cripple.
Tell you what: how about cis people just stop telling me what I am, K.
Chicane, "Saltwater"
@bezukhova When is it?
@destieluk I love you.
@riotheatherrr @sassyphos I love that pronoun too. :D
Engaging in pronoun fuckery tonight on Facebook. Trying out "she."
One feature of hyper-visibility in disability (and I suppose in gender or sexuality as well) is that it makes you easier to ignore.
New Twitter handle. Quite like it tbqh.
Drinking abled tears rn.
So abled privilege means an increased likelihood that activists will be behind you when you call out ableism.
That thing where you see old tagged photos of yourself and think yeah, OK, that is me. But it isn't me... and eh, OK. But still.
@ablegirl It's actually totally grey and cold, but thanks. And you :)
@msamykey I don't think meritocracy exists tbh.
Currently listening to the new Sufjan Stevens. WIth SS, the question is never "Is it good?" but always "How good?"
BUT... those @Daredevil TV spots? Holy shit. MARVEL TAKE MY MONEY. I know, Netflix is free, but let me pay for this. Goddamn.
@wackyhistorian Yup, I get that. I will probably try more episodes but I'm not champing at the bit to do so I have to say.
@wackyhistorian I've seen 1 episode + I wasn't a fan. I wasn't into the way they portrayed Titus Andromedon either (black gay con artist?).
#LRT @netflix + @Marvel's @Daredevil publicising their use of a Blind consultant. Good. Can't find the actors? Promote disabled consultants.
@FedoraHippie @HereBeSin That's probably something else we've all done, I know I have.
@FedoraHippie @HereBeSin It's all good now. Honest. It happens + we've all done it.
@FedoraHippie @HereBeSin I retweeted it because I agree with that completely. We just have to be careful of what we insinuate in our crits.
@FedoraHippie @HereBeSin I can't speak to / about all uses of the word "basic", but in the context of "dumb", yeah those are the inferences.
@FedoraHippie @HereBeSin Sorry, I've been away from the 'net. No worries, of course you're not condemned, but now you know :)
@RadioTimes @rickygervais And hopefully the last disgustingly ableist caricature.
It's Adam and Eve, not Ruth and Naomi. Wait, what?
@FedoraHippie @HereBeSin Apologies, I fucked up retweeting the ableist word without comment. The whole concept of "basic people" is ableist.

"13 Reasons Why Generic AFAB Transmasculine Person Is The Androgynous Model Of Your Dreams" - Buzzfeed
@DisaResources @CaperWheelLady I wish I could name more of them: I'm gonna say Peter Dinklage.
I've been working harder on poems the last few days than I have done for months. Maybe that's why I suddenly feel so shitty.
I want to go back to the days when I said "I'm down, help, show me a picture of a cute kitten", and it actually worked.
The only people I speak to or share life with anymore are my family or online. I know, I suck because online friendship counts.
I don't want supportive people to stop talking to me, but neither do I want all this surface. I miss my old friends.
I don't participate in April Fool's Day because I can't lie.
I know, I'm a horrible person, but sometimes I just want to switch off the "over-enthusiastic ally" setting on the game.
How about tackling redistribution of wealth, free market greed, that sort of thing. Or just, you know, start a new restaurant chain.
Dear Jamie Oliver, if you want to tackle the "global obesity epidemic", how about having a pop at your beloved capitalism.
@helen_bleep Sherwood Forest-smoked Wild Boar.
LOL Jamie Oliver "needs my help" / is worried about "global obesity epidemic" in my email. The world needs more lean organic pheasant obvs.
@Openyoureyes89 @stillicides I'd never have added "she" as another option to "they" if I hadn't had the relative safety of online community.
@Openyoureyes89 @stillicides I only enforce pronouns online except with certain family + friends. But online is good for trying them out.
@CarolRundle @KatrinaMoody Unfortunately for some people life is still long enough to offend, upset, stress out, and discourage.
Fact: I don't have a pronounced Adam's Apple. Let's start referring to them the same way as belly buttons: innies + outies, for all genders.
#LRT As does "Just be you", "Express yourself", and "Don't listen to what other people think."

Went to scratch my head and my hair clip fell out. #NeedPracticeTransing
Beautiful trans ppl all over my feed, wow. #TDOV
Trans girls w/ religious families who make you measure your worth by the Bible: you matter, you are loved, you are wonderfully made. #TDOV
Trans women + transfeminine ppl who can't be visible, for reasons of your own safety: you are valid, real, beautiful. You exist. #TDOV
@Sheep_Purple Thank you! :)
So here is me today. First day ever with a (Frozen) hair clip in, and wearing Dory the neuroqueer fish. #TDoV 
A lot of cis ppl seem to think we're "identifying" as a gender "on top of" what we were assigned. Guys, stop trying to make me somehow male.
It's International Transgender Day of Visibility! Brothers, sisters, siblings, whether you're out or not, be visible in spirit heart + mind.
Tbh I just want to see the Abraham + Eugene show called Abegine. Also starring Rosita + a few other WoC actors TBC. Plus RJ Mitte.
Sometimes I think if the #TWD writers put as much care into everyone's lines as they do into Eugene's, we'd have a consistently good show.
Last time I was in a room with a Spina bifida doctor talking about my genitals it was awful. Maybe if just no one mentioned them, tbh.
@bendyleopard Stranger: "Sorry, what? You're disabled *and* trans? I can't let you go until we figure this out together."

Or so you'd think...
Tbh I often wonder if male-read trans people are more likely to be asked about their genitals if they're in a wheelchair / visibly disabled.

- People with whom I’ve agreed to have sex

Honestly, I do feel as if she justifies a new space mission. She's so famous. They could cut costs by forgetting the oxygen.
@ablegirl I was thinking more like maybe a rocket to Mars.
I keep feeling as if Katie Hopkins "leaving the country" isn't *quite* enough for me to vote for Labour. I wonder if she'll up the stakes.
The pilot could've been "depressed." Maybe "terrorists" can be depressed. Point is "depressed" + "terrorist" are top-down journalistic spin.
When writing poetry begins to feel like doing Etch-A-Sketch it's probably time to do something else.

Anyone calling themselves a mental health activist + saying disgusting things about people with BPD can help me shrink my follow list. Bye.
Dude makes social criticism online. I agree with his OP. Another dude replies after "I disagree, think of it this way", gets loads of likes.
I've become super suspicious of activism seminars + conferences etc that advertise themselves by using questions / provoking "conversation."
That was one thing I really wanted. Back in the day I rage quit when they moved to L.A. I picked the show back up again years later.
This interview with David Duchovny confirms they're shooting new X-Files in Vancouver. YEEEEEESSSS 
I just came out to my brother as trans and he was totally amazing about it. What even is this?
@HylomantisL Pffft.
I don't know what anyone's gender is anymore unless they tell me. This is living.
@applewriter Haha yes it did, it was fantastic. Lots of "OMG" when it dropped.
Listening to "Sweet Like Chocolate" in 2015.
I don't know where I am with God (only religion) but it makes my heart happy to see ppl use "they / them" pronouns for God.
But who's gonna let a masculine-presenting transfemme person rewrite feminism? *shrug*
Whether or not society sees + recognises trans people, they are still socialised to know, sooner or later, that they are trans people.
If we want to call our feminism intersectional, we must assume that the narratives that have been saving our lives have been killing others.
If we want to call our feminism intersectional, we must let oppressed communities radically edit, change + rewrite our feminist narratives.
If we want to call our feminism intersectional, we have to interrogate all of our narratives + ask whose perspective/ "gaze" they come from.
If we want to call our feminism intersectional, we have to interrogate all of our feminist narratives + ask whose stories they're excluding.
Let's survey the evidence: "male privilege"/ "socialised male" imposed retroactively on trans girls came from? White cis het abled feminism.
I was socialised: physically disabled + neurodivergent, domestically religiously economically unproductive / useless, non-binary trans girl.
This phenomenon whereby cis white feminism calls itself "intersectional" but still propagates "socialised (cis white) male / female." WTF.
Feminism that preaches a "socialised male / socialised female" binary narrative is not intersectional. That binary has silenced my story.
Ppl who think being behind a computer cancels out oppression and makes us all equal: try being a masculine-presenting trans woman.
So the guy who hijacked and crashed this plane was white? Ah so it's "suicide" rather than "terrorism / mass murder" then.
Words I have been misspelling forever and thinking I was right: "disproportionately" (as "disproportionally). There we go.
"Give me the opportunity to fight you, or you're not doing any good", as if that is our purpose on the planet. Nope.
But I do not need to be talking right at you, and opening myself up to receiving your derailments and microaggressions, to be "effective.
But oppressors also make us feel that we're not being in any way "effective" unless we're looking them right in the eye while we work.
Don't undermine or play down the importance of publicly sharing experience + ideas with other oppressed ppl. Oppressors read that too.
I'm not a pastor and I'm not speaking to the pews. Besides, the pews are either empty or full of heckling unbelievers.
The other thing we have to stop is this "preaching to the choir" nonsense. When ppl tell me I do that I say get in the fucking choir + sing.
Speaking of rewording: I will reword for you if you are on any axis of oppression that affects your ability to access my meaning. That's it.
The only ppl expected to be on call constantly to explain, clarify, reword, be politer, less angry, more forgiving, are oppressed activists.
But you know, Marx isn't just dead. He's an abled cis white male, so... nobody is going "Ugh I wish Marx was around I don't get this shit."
I don't remember cis abled allies caring that Marx wasn't around anymore to "explain" everything to them. Because they have Google.
Why? Because more often than not, abled "allies" are shitty people who will do anything to invalidate our identities and words.
If it WAS in the dictionary, we'd have abled "allies" constantly "correcting" us about its usage instead of saying "That's not a real word."
"Ableism" isn't in the dictionary because society doesn't give a shit about it, even though we've been using it since at least the 80s.
So yeah. Cis and / or abled allies or activists who give me that "Be better for the sake of your oppressors" crap will be unfollowed.
I don't need to make myself more accessible to cis abled society. Cis abled society needs to make itself more accessible to me.
"Make this easier to understand", when coming from abled "allies", actually means "Say something I like instead of something I don't."
The main disabled right you're not giving me is the right to explain or extrapolate as and when I want to instead of according to your whim.
While I'm making my activist vocabulary more free of "jargon" / more simple for you to read, how many disabled rights am I gaining? None.
Abled allies of mine can prove their commitment to my causes by Googling my terms + teaching themselves not demanding that I make it easier.
Abled ppl aren't listening to disabled activists because abled people don't listen to disabled ppl not because of "jargon" or "in-speaking."
I'm willing to believe that Dean Winchester is canon straight*.

It's funny how those who succeed in a "meritocracy" are always the same kinds of ppl, isn't it? It's almost as if "meritocracy" is bollocks.
Don't ask whether you should unfollow the thread with the dude who just replied. Just do it.
TFW cis feminism blames "cis men" for stuff while perpetuating their gender-essentialist values and misgendering trans men as women.
I'm limited. Just look at me. I'm limited.
@slasher48 I just know that if you don't like Angel, that's fine, but don't contrast him with Spike as a reason.

@Lizbeth_City ...I'm one of 20% of shunt patients with those pains. Which basically means I'm a superhero I think.
@Lizbeth_City I'm been told it's to do with muscle and nerve changes around the shunt as the fluid courses through. Apparently also...
@Lizbeth_City I have torso and shoulder pains like electric shocks, which can happen through changes in air pressure and temperature. Weird.
@Lizbeth_City Do you get that too?? Shunt pains that basically help you predict the weather?
@Lizbeth_City I am sorry, that sucks. :( I hope you get the help you need and they don't fob you off.
@Lizbeth_City Yes I do, when I'm under a lot of stress. Luckily I don't have headaches in daily life very much but check them out when I do.
I'm thoroughly convinced that some men "thoroughly disagree" with me on the internet because my name ends with "ie" + I have a pink avatar.

Chris Carter looks back on the X-Files legacy: 
It seems Chris Carter is confirming here that he won't be the only writer: 
@SamuraiKnitter @doloresonthedot Privilege is the luxury of thinking "labels" = bad / superfluous, never meaningful / empowering.
@SamuraiKnitter @doloresonthedot You can wish for me to not be labelled by others, but removing my chosen labels is violence.
@SamuraiKnitter @doloresonthedot We've all done it. The issue is lost on a lot of privileged liberal "allies", but it's devious + dangerous.

Over/under on how many of the 6 new #TheXFiles episodes will begin with voice-overs?
@FedoraHippie @SeeMid_Tweet There are some cis people that need running down tbh.
@sarahlicity Do you think they thought the Ming vases they were making in China were black and gold?
Vancouver was so crucial to the mood + aesthetic of X-Files, first time round I gave up watching when they moved to L.A, LOL #TheXFIles
Also... PLEASE SHOOT IN VANCOUVER NOT L.A. *prays* #TheXFiles
@SpoonieBeauty Yeah, let's hope "reboot" is just inaccurate terminology. *gulp*
@Holly_Rose_ Haha never a truer word spoken.
@Holly_Rose_ Fact is, they sort of already did. So they need to go out with a bang or forget it.
@SpoonieBeauty Well, at this point they're in an established relationship right? So it'll be hard to handle, but they can't retcon that.
I'm just yet to be convinced that they will do it right. #TheXFiles
I think 6 episodes set against this global colonization of the planet by aliens would be cool IF they do it right. #TheXFiles
@SpoonieBeauty Sorry, LOL I meant "wants" not "once."
@SpoonieBeauty I've read articles that said Chris Carter once to wrap up the mythology in the first movie. They need to do that WELL or meh.
@SpoonieBeauty Yeah. At this point I'd love a new whole season of case fics, but I've known for a while we're not getting that.
3) OK, but where's Vince Gilligan? #TheXFiles
2) We aren't expecting Chris Carter to deliver a satisfying mythos resolution are we? He is the creator but not the best writer. #TheXFiles
I wish I was more excited about #TheXFiles returning but I want more questions answered before I shout for joy. 1) Is 6 episodes enough?
@utterlyhorrid And be careful + skeptical if someone with privilege over you says that you have this unchanging "privilege."
@utterlyhorrid "Conditional privilege" is a thing but it's not what ppl mean when they point a finger at you + say you have "privilege."
Abled + cis privilege imposes the "passing privilege" concept on disabled + trans ppl. Cis privilege imposes "socialised m/f" on trans ppl.
Like, we're aware that "passing" can mean we're more prone to violence, not less, right?
@trollhare ...like with "passing" or "not passing", that's no real accurate way to asses how oppressed and mistreated someone is.
@trollhare True. A lot of what we call "visible" or "invisible" are actually just what other people notice vs. what they don't. And just...
Not all disability is visible. Not all aspects of hyper-visible disability are visible either.
OK I think I said everything. *breathes*
Pick a side. Are we women or not? And at least in terms of interacting with me, if you decide "no", get off my follow list.
Trans women are disproportionately harmed by cis feminists playing fast + loose with the alleged "feminists* vs trans people debate."
Emphasising trans women here because TERFs tend to misgender trans men as women + many trans men like the protection they receive from that.
You can "debate" whether trans women are women all you want, but never pretend it's "feminist" discussion. It's misogyny. GTFO with that.
How dare anyone frame hate speech against me as a feminist "debate." Ugh.
@marstrina This is bullshit. There is no "debate." There are TERFs and they disbelieve and hate trans women, full-stop.
@QueenSno I don't know when I decided that I was in it for the long haul with this show, but I underestimated how painful that would be. Ha.
@QueenSno Hashtag for The Walking Dead :) This episode surprised me, I have to say. I was expecting the worst and it was... not the worst.
Rick + Jesse. Do not ship. #TWD

Therapist: Can you describe it?
Me: ...nice try
@PeakePoetics @danielsluman @StephenKuusisto Awesome, I've just done the thing. Thanks for the recommendation!
Oh and btw I used "legitimately" there deliberately, because privileged majority society gets to decide what "legitimate" is.
Privilege means having the systemic power behind you to legitimately throw out any premise of any discussion whatsoever, as you will.
Repeatedly, when people want to "debate" my identity the only perspective in danger of being voted out is that my identity exists + is real.
I'm not interested in protecting men from critique. I'm interested in protecting trans women and trans feminine people from harm.
Therefore what you think is good well-established feminist critique can be transmisogyny. Be careful.
Yes, cis society locates patriarchal power in the penis. Yes, it can identify us based on the penis. But this is trans women's oppression.
There are much better analyses of the harm done by men + the male gender than those which focus on genitals. Please learn them + use them.
FFS, STOP EQUATING PATRIARCHAL POWER WITH PENISES.
Thank you.
@danileekelley OH, it's the "IMPENETRABLE WALL OF TEXT. ARGUMENT INVALID" technique, huh? I blocked a guy cos it was his special move.
@ilovemyneurons I use other terms too. I'm amab so feel OK to use "trans woman" in some spaces and conversations considering my NB identity.
The beauty of being non-binary is just how many compatible terms you can use for yourself, if you're careful. Nuances are my fave.
I just said "I am a non-binary trans woman" for the first time. Now to convince my troll brain I was allowed to do that.
@averrer (Even though, I'd argue, the general point about lack of consent for babies being gendered is a good one.)
@averrer Cool. Sorry for spamming you with tweets, this is why I don't like Twitter for conversation. If in doubt don't use "coercively." :)
@the_author_ Haha, that's awesome.
@averrer For what it's worth, I use "amab" to be on the safe side.
@averrer Society coercively genders all of us, as babies aren't able to give their consent. That's the point.
@averrer Intersex people may prefer one word over another, and we should respect that. But they don't own the concept.
@averrer But the concept as a whole was invented by trans women to describe the systemic (mis)gendering of doctors upon trans people.
@averrer ...are happy that trans people use "assigned" even if they might be unhappy with "coercively" or "designated."
@averrer I don't know what individual intersex people ask individual trans people to do. But I know intersex nonbinary trans ppl + they...
@averrer It's kind of a myth that they exclusively do, but if in doubt, you might be more comfortable using dmab/dfab for us.
@averrer Nope, those terms were designed by trans women to describe their experience, although intersex people use camab/cafab.
@averrer Or "designated" -- dfab / dmab.
@averrer Re birth misgendering, we use "(coercively) assigned male at birth" -- "camab" / "(coercively) assigned female at birth" -- cafab.
@averrer I'm not entirely sure but I *think* that would be called cissexism and / or transantagonism. Both aspects of transphobia.
@averrer ...sense of self, NOT some way that society made you someone you aren't. If they tried to raise me as "male", they failed.
@averrer Cis society uses the term "socialisation" wrongly. Socialisation is everything in society which develops our identity and our...
@averrer In other words, I could say I was socialised as a trans girl who society thought was a boy.
@averrer ...simultaneously learning, thanks to that same society, who we inherently are as ourselves.
@averrer ...part of our lives, or all of our lives, being misgendered as our assigned gender based on our bodies, doesn't mean we aren't...
@averrer Framing it in this way goes against the cis idea that we "change genders" or "become another gender." Just because we spend...
@averrer So, society was wrong about my "assigned gender." But I grew into the realisation of my own gender, which was my innate identity.
@averrer ...that it's wrong. For society to say I "used to be a boy", that's misgendering when I didn't understand myself to be a boy.
@averrer Because part of our collective experience is that we are 1) assigned a gender at birth that is wrong, and 2) grow up to realise...
@RaavynnDigitaL @ChelseaPoe666 Look at how much stuff which is created by cis people gets praised as "raising trans awareness."
@RaavynnDigitaL @ChelseaPoe666 Capitalism-assimilated cis feminist awards shows I'm guessing. Capitalism ruins everything.
@RaavynnDigitaL @ChelseaPoe666 It was the fact any of it was phrased as a question that got me riled up. These shouldn't be questions tbh.
@RaavynnDigitaL @ChelseaPoe666 Which is why I just replied "I'm sorry I may have read you wrong." This is super triggering + makes me angry.
@ChelseaPoe666 But to be clear, no I wouldn't trust it as feminist. Cis feminism can be grossly transmisogynistic. This looks that way.
@ChelseaPoe666 Sorry, I may have read you wrong. This whole subject is gross and I'm feeling rather dysphoric now.
@RaavynnDigitaL @ChelseaPoe666 Are you kidding? Why are we even wondering whether a "shemale" site owned by a cis white male is feminist?
@ChelseaPoe666 It's a cis-gaze porn category, not a "transfeminist" one. I wouldn't be comfortable in any feminist space it sponsored.
@ChelseaPoe666 WTF? Well there's your answer. You're seriously asking why a cis white male might want to use the word "shemale"?
@ChelseaPoe666 3) There are trans women who side with TERF ideas and derogatory terms. Nevertheless they are damaging.
@ChelseaPoe666 1) Is this website owned by cis feminists? If so it isn't transfeminist. 2) Some trans women are laterally transmisogynistic.
@ChelseaPoe666 @RaavynnDigitaL Essentially, trans women don't identify as "shemale" for the same reason cis women don't. They are women.
@ChelseaPoe666 @RaavynnDigitaL Which makes me wonder what feminist spaces you're in tbh.
@ChelseaPoe666 @RaavynnDigitaL So are "faggot" and "retard." So what? It's a slur and no one uses it in any feminist space I've been in.
@ChelseaPoe666 @RaavynnDigitaL Trans women don't identify as "shemale" because they are not fucking male in any way, shape or form.
@ChelseaPoe666 @RaavynnDigitaL No, and no, I would think. I'm all for transfeminist porn but that word is transmisogynistic.
@averrer The "socialised male" / "socialised female" binary is one that can only be applied to cis people. Even then it's a shaky concept.
@averrer ...as trans people. That is our collective socialisation.
@averrer So that societal misgendering that happens until we learn who we are (and even afterwards, continually) is our common experience...
@averrer Rather than saying I "used to be" another gender (which harms trans women), I say that I was my gender, and society misgendered me.
@averrer Trans women aren't "really male" as TERFs would say. "Socialisation" makes us who we are, not who we aren't, Cis people misuse it.
@averrer Trans girls were socialised as trans girls. Trans boys were socialised as trans boys. Non-binary people were socialised as NB kids.
@averrer The main point is in the 1st sentence. Others have written about the subject better than me. But "socialised X" is a cis concept.
@averrer If I can think of a way to reword, I'll try.
Reminder: "socialised male" + "socialised female" are both bunk. As a queer disabled + neurodivergent person, I was socialised non-binary.
RIP Sheila Holt, told she was "fit to work" while in a coma. This is why I reject "anti-hate" rhetoric. If you vote Tory I hate you.
@HylomantisL Given that it's genitalia, yes.
Yes, if you misgender me and call me words for genitalia because you are angry at me and hate me, you're still a transphobe.
Can we just ban the use of any genitalia as an insult?
Sometimes I pretend that just maybe, talking to *this one dude* online won't go the same derailed way as the others did. And then it does.
@AnathemaJane Oh, LOL yeah that was a fun post to write.
And they've set in motion plot threads that I can't possibly like the resolution of, so I'm super nervous about the end of this season.
Which kind of makes it one of the worst episodes of the series, because I usually don't have much negative to say about them in isolation.
@destieluk echoing my feels on the latest #TWD. I don't know if there was a single thing I liked about it except for Eugene being funny.
This evening is a difficult end to a better birthday, overall. Then someone online uses "she" pronouns for me and my smile returns.
@AnathemaJane Haha. Awww, sorry what is this referring to? x
@destieluk Thank you my love :) x
"How can you identify as non-binary as well as a girl?" How can you identify as British as well as English?
@rishie_ Me too. You may feel different about the new one. I hope you do :)
@RadicalEmu Yeah, it came across that way ;)
@RadicalEmu As in: I'm aware a lot of people hate them.
@rishie_ The first album is genuinely good though imo.
@rishie_ They were always a band that followed a trend, and I knew that as soon as it stopped being profitable they'd move on.
@rishie_ Yeah, afraid so. Wholly unremarkable. Nothing of the folk sound at all.
@RadicalEmu Please respect the fact that I'll get hundreds of responses exactly like this.
And yeah, Coldplay comparisons abound with this or that band. But this really does sound like Coldplay, with a bit of Bon Iver thrown in.
The new Mumford &amp; Sons song contains nothing that I used to like about Mumford &amp; Sons. Oh well.
@meganamram @prattprattpratt Sorry but I'm sort of failing to get the joke.
@awhooker Wow, talking to Christians about privilege. That's something I was never able to do.
@denofgeek Wow this is so obviously a "What about the menz?" move. "We have to address this inequality!"
TFW even planning to relax in front of Netflix for the night, and failing to do that, makes you feel like a failure all round.
Do you think "allies" who unfriend me + storm off in a tantrum will use my pronouns when they tell their friends how awful I am?
Ugh everything.
#TheWalkingHope 
I really should stay away from every thread about ableism tbh. They're always covered in ableism and ableism denial.
LOL, Carol. #TWD
@zaranosaur Fantastic! :)
@zaranosaur Thank you :D How are you?
Or yesterday, because now it's the early hours of Monday.
I was SO happy today. I just had to share that.
I've never needed to teach anyone about sex; they've generally been very good at it.
I saw an article posted earlier on called something like "What disabled people have to teach us about sex." My only response was hahahahaha.
It's much too easy to say "Don't be biased." Where do your biases lie, and what societal problems are your biases addressing?
To my feminist, transfeminist + transfeminine friends, you don't have to but you still save my life daily. Happy International Women's Day!
@isobeldixon @EssBarraclough I don't know what they put in the limes but that Lime High Club... wow.
My wife is watching Pitch Perfect. Win.
@destieluk Awww I love you too &lt;3 Happy happy.
My gender is sunshine so you can't abolish it.
In the last 2 days I've worn my "men's" checked lumberjack shirts + for the first time, still felt femme. Happy International Women's Day!
Forward to the Past #TerribleSpinoffIdeas
All I want is for Jurassic World to be released right now so I can watch it over and over and over again for the rest of my life.
You know, sometimes I think I would be the happiest person alive if everyone around me was OK just for a solid 24 hours.
Which is fine, really, because I only have one opinion about poetry these days: it isn't that important.
I think I've just finally reached the point where I'm not allowed an opinion anymore tbh.
More specifically: several poets debate pros + cons of a book. I enter + say the title is shit. Suddenly all eyes are on my disagreement.
People on thread have a discussion. I enter, disagree with one point. Attention is drawn to my disagreement for as long as possible.
When they release a Walking Dead episode each week they should release 3 Walking Dead episodes so we can watch 3 episodes instead of just 1.
aaand *block*
@MarkAntonyOwen I wouldn't think once about that, tbh. :/
Dear Labour, the Tories are in fact doing *too much* for disabled people -- too much fucking around with our lives. You want to up that?
Labour's rhetoric around the notion that "The Tories aren't doing enough for disabled people" makes me want to smash things.
@Pasunepomme It's pretty slim pickings for takeout pizza near us, haha.
Let's be honest, Labour could do whatever the hell they wanted to. But they "can't" because they're Tories in red ties.
"Labour cannot reverse Legal Aid cuts." Is there anything Labour can do, or are they planning on twiddling their thumbs the entire time?
Dominos Pizza are having a laugh with how expensive they are.
Better Call Saul is still great.
I know it hurts. #EncourageEveryoneIn4Words
@IsaJennie @debecca So they're not gender IDs in themselves, but necessary prefixes to gender IDs.
@IsaJennie @debecca I'd say cis + trans describe a person's relationship with their assigned gender: cis = identify with it, trans = don't.
I could've said "trans and disabled" but that seemed like pouring on the emotional manipulation. You get it.
Support a trans person by supporting their family! My wife + I would love you forever if you could donate to this:

@RednorthUK Let's be honest, relying on Church or State is a tossup tbh.
@Pasunepomme @wackyhistorian Absolutely.
@wackyhistorian @Pasunepomme I think I have like two episodes left of the ones we have so far. I love it, but for some reason stopped.
Indominus Robin. InRobinus Rex.
That's a scary fucking robin, tbf.
Jurassic Park 12: The New Breed 
Love your anemones.
I find it very telling when cis allies are cool with my "they / them" pronouns but freak out or go quiet when I say "she / her" works too.

Stop punishing me for being DISABLED!

#ScrapWCA #Maximar…
And, damn the writers for making me want a ship to become canon! #TWD
Well, The Walking Dead just gets better and better.
Haha, Rick suddenly looks a lot like that doctor from Holby City again. #TWD
Seriously, anyone who would attach a young age, or race, or class to honesty, selfies and self-love is not someone I want to speak to.
I don't even know what the hashtags are for that.
Best of luck to the anti-Maximus protesters today!
@SciPhiKat @FHawksworth I think she was born in the US but divides her time pretty equally between here and there.
Piece of shit.
#LRT "Regrets, disordered eating, feeling deeply unlovable. There may be a sisterhood, but it’s too often a fake intimacy..."- Suzanne Moore
#LRT STFU that we marginalized folks have any obligation to stop posting selfies for a highly-paid, second-wave cis feminist journalist. No.
Wow this Suzanne Moore piece is an ableist, racist, queerphobic piece of shit (I could've removed "piece" tbh): 
@CassandraB At the time I didn't realise that both experiences were mine.
@CassandraB My first intersectional thing (I didn't call it that) was to compare the experience of queer and disabled people in the church.
@CassandraB There's every chance I would have come out to myself earlier if White Feminism had included disability. It didn't, so I didn't.
@CassandraB Discovering feminism was my first step on the road to coming out tbh. It literally saved my life.
The thing is I never understood male rage against feminism. When I found intersectional feminism I quickly realised it was telling my story.
My love for Jonsi from Sigur Ros is intense and unwavering.
@emmt_rex I've been explaining to people that yes, I might have agreed I was cis, because I knew nothing else. But I never agreed to "man."
@emmt_rex The most important epiphany I've had is "Holy shit, I was always this. This was always me."
Why is coming out as trans culturally framed as changing our futures instead of reframing our histories?
Literally, I reckon the last person on earth, before everyone goes *kaboom*, will be me, sitting at my computer laughing at a meme.
Of all the costume changes in Disney's Aladdin, my favourite is the black and blue one he wears as Prince Ali.
Despite the fact I rarely knew what was happening or why, Jupiter Ascending was absolutely glorious! "Does any part of you want to bite me?"
@soul_into_hades @SciPhiKat OK. Make sure you follow the guidelines closely please :)
I need men to stop killing trans women.
@latentexistence @soul_into_hades The important thing is that you know yourself. That's everything really.
@latentexistence @soul_into_hades I'm 100% sure it won't be an easy life + we are erased + ignored at every turn, but what can you do, eh?
@latentexistence @soul_into_hades I did too! It's fab that you wrote this, congrats, I'm reading it now.
@sturdyAlex's New Statesman article = disappointing: man doesn't like the term "mansplaining." Man doesn't like man's take on feminism etc.
@chiller @auntysarah Also they'll pronounce their victory in a debate without having ever addressed any of your points?
@crackerologist @LibrarianBoi @UNICEF What in the fresh hell is this?
Eddie Redmayne in "The Gender Of Everything Ascending."
"I mean, why do we have to worry about labels?" "Oh, sorry, let's try that again: *grunt* *grunt*, *grunt* *grunt* *grunt* *grunt*...*burp*?
TFW you don't know how much you need cis loved ones to understand about transness for you to feel they really accept you.
"It's white and gold, Scully."
"Mulder, the truth is out there, but so are lies." 
The dress is from Roman. There is a Roman in town. I almost feel like making a pilgrimage there now.
Holy shit did OITNB start back already? I forgot.
If "order of creation" theology makes no space for you in society, I do. I will. I promise.
I won't be interested in a Thatcher museum unless it displays her head in a glass box to be honest, so I can take a selfie with it.
@stevesilberman @LindaChown2015 There's nothing inherently wrong with anger. There's nothing inherently right about tolerance.
It's a privilege to believe that "being the centre of attention" is anything more, or extra, than being treated as a human being.
One day I'll try to unpack in writing what I mean when I say "I hate men", but I'm still (enjoying the heck out of) unpacking it for myself.
Oh and did I say The Walkng Dead was also pretty great?
So this week's Better Call Saul might've been the most consistently entertaining so far, and that's saying something.
@bendyleopard @waitinggirl13 Yeah, shaking hands seems overwhelmingly male to me even if there are exceptions.
@waitinggirl13 @bendyleopard Fighting and phallic symbols!
@robotpinemarten @SciPhiKat I will find one eventually but today they had run out of my size. :(
@waitinggirl13 women*, sorry
@waitinggirl13 Yeah on average it's more European but I get it occasionally from woman and non-men.
@FedoraHippie Yeah, so it's like "Stop what you're doing and greet me!" Haha.
@FedoraHippie The handshake is a male power-play. I'm out.
@waitinggirl13 But I'm also funny when ppl kiss my cheek because I never know whether to do that back + I usually feel like no.
@waitinggirl13 Tbh I'd rather be hugged.
You know what I realised today? I DO NOT LIKE having my hand shaken.
@stripedtigrrr Trans and queer men do it too.
IMO, men see "SJW" vocabulary being used + instantly assume that the writer is in a state of uncontrollable rage that must be quelled.
Which is weird, because the implication is that I've risen to some angry irrational emotional state and I'm just sitting here eating crisps.
I literally can't be on a thread without someone (usually a man) jumping on it in order to tell everyone to settle down and be friends.
It really pisses me off when people call violent oppressors "cowards." What are they scared of? Stop it. We are the scared ones.
@Gildy55 @Openyoureyes89 @Novembervivi @alibali50 Internalized ableism is so natural + second-nature, and the system fuels it. Solidarity.
Is it just me or does Vince Gilligan often just look like he needs a hug?
After hearing some complaints about the new Wonder Woman comic being a bit flat, these Thor panels look AMAZING: 
I hope you're happy. I hope you're happy now. I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever. I hope you think that's clever.
@lexabdhayy That's really kind of you. I'll keep you posted.
@CassandraB That's a beautifully true analogy. It's like I've retired from the show but suddenly they need me as an extra.
@CassandraB So being thrown into an old-style space / interaction was off-putting but my friend was once so close to me, also sad.
@CassandraB Yeah. I felt like that for all of my adult life, but I didn't know why. Now I do, I've changed my spaces + interactions.
@CassandraB Of which this friend I met sort of is one. Not in a necessarily harmful way just in a... wait I need to rehearse my lines way.
@CassandraB I mean like, hanging out with bro-dudes.
@risha_ No, it's not bollocks at all. Thank you, and for the hugs :)
@risha_ You're right. Totally. I've been told I shouldn't have to carry the entire weight of other people disappearing, it's on them.
And now I'm crying. But yeah, cis shits, it's "just a Tumblr thing."
@CassandraB Yes. And I can't. I can't even try. I don't know what to do anymore and being good at the social etiquette was acting.
I tiny part of me wants to josh around with them and make it like it was but I can't, it's irrevocable and there's no turning back.
I feel sad. So much beautiful laughing + joking about misandry + yes men are awful + awkward but I'm sad that I can't be doing with friends.
I'm so fucking lucky for all the people who have stayed, but I continue to not know who they all are, or how long they'll stomach me.
TW: deadnaming. You know what else I feel? Guilt. For changing + making so many old friends unsure of how to know me anymore.
My personhood is not an online game.
TW: deadnaming. If you've feigned friendship + closeness while reading my shit on FB but then meet me IRL + act like nothing's changed? No.
TW: deadnaming. - Seriously when ppl have spent ages distancing themselves from a name because it represents someone different, just don't.
Ugh I wish they'd had my pink hoodie in my size, at least all that misgendering and bro-ing might've paid off.
After that I was almost home and some seemingly drunk old guy yelled at me "Oi, can I have a free ride in your chair?" "Fuck no" I said.
And I wanted to stop him and tell him what's been happening but I had to reckon with whether the investment was worth it. Decided it wasn't,
On the way back from town an old friend stopped me, dead-named me, shook my hand twice, called me "bro" and "man" and... it was awkward.
Tweeps, they were out of my SIZE. So no pink hoodie for me, my search continues.
Thank you everyone. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. So here I go.
Should I buy a cheap pink hoodie today? I know it's silly but it feels like a big step so I need a push.
#LRT Literally gasping with excitement at something which is so uncertain is NOT the way to live.
#LRT Please, any possible deities known and unknown, MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
But maybe I want Carl and Judith to have Rick-and-Michonne.
OK, so, Michonne deserves better than Rick, but Oh. My. God.
Stand back, I'm about to have a theory of everything.
@SydMT That's interesting, thank you for sharing that.
On assigned gender: just because you grew to like something that was given to you, it doesn't mean you willfully took it.
Clothes My Mother Just Bought Me, episode #2: "Hero and Queero." 


I want to talk about demigenders. But when I think of words, all I can come up with is "Demigenders matter. Demigender people, you matter."
Funny how some of the people most in need of a "civilised discussion" find every benign opinion you have threatening, isn't it?
Patriarchy invades bodies, does not know what it is to be invaded.
@no2dhc Last retweet :) It basically means "the following tweet refers to the last thing I retweeted."
Lately I'm headcanoning Kristoff from Frozen as nonbinary, pretty hard. I need to watch it again to gather my evidence.
@denzelwynter &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
#LRT It's also our intention to be intersectional. Even disability discourse centres whiteness and other privileged identities. Let's not!
#LRT Remember we are looking for poetry by disabled and / or deaf poets / poets with disabilities, about and / or from disability.
#LRT The news is getting out there, we're already seeing submissions. Exciting! See submission guidelines to see if you + your work qualify.
One major feature of ableism, I think, is that abled people assume they can be let off forever on the basis they "just misunderstand."
Dear abled activists, ableism is deeper and more subtle and more invisible than you'll ever know, unless you're us. Let us correct you.
@Sheep_Purple Right! Not too "form-over-function."
Donation link: 
Aesthetic: "divisive."
@Sheep_Purple Hmmm. That sounds like a binary to me. Can we not just live with the tension?
@Lizbeth_City "Have you ever felt like part of the furniture? Now you can BE part of the furniture with our new florals range."
A new Jurassic World plot trailer is coming in April. Does nobody have any IDEA how far that is away? What are they trying to do to me?
@Lizbeth_City It's a budget store. Their clothes are ridiculously loud/bright. I've bought a fair few of them, but these are on a new level!
The problem with Facebook (well one of them) is that you can block someone but you can't block every mention of their name.
@Lizbeth_City When Primark out-Primarks Primark.
Welcome to a new groundbreaking series: Clothes My Mother Just Bought Me, episode #1: "Just look at the flowers." 
"Privilege discourse" as a phrase is just like "gender theory." Code weaponised by antagonists.
#LRT me IRL
@CassandraB @theoriesofminds @philosovashka @riotheatherrr I don't even really know what kinds there are :/ I'm a total n00b.
@theoriesofminds @CassandraB @philosovashka @riotheatherrr I've been thinking about chokers as an idea. I've no idea where to look.
@whedonworship I don't really even think about "Do I like it?" regarding clothes anymore. All I want to know is "Do I feel good in it?"
@whedonworship Pretty much, yeah. I mean they're even brighter / louder. And I already like loud / bright. That's Primark.
This also means that my life's dream to become a posterqueer for Primark is closer than it's ever been.
I don't think my brain can process this: my wife was like "Look at these! Do you know what this means?" and I was like "Cool, T-shirts!"
In an unexpected apparent gesture of acceptance, my mum just returned from shopping with my stepkids, with three femme T-shirts for me? Um.
The more time I spend away from my dead name, the worse it feels to be called it.
My wife is so amazing, she makes me believe in cis people.
When you hear someone in the room get Rickrolled.
The only requirement of an activist is presence.
Just occasionally I look in the mirror and think "I have reached optimal enby cuteness today." Today was one of those days.
Reminder: the majority of "mistakes" Jurassic World is making about dinosaurs are also being made by the Natural History Museum, London.
Sometimes the #TWD Rick and "Coral" meme is enough to give me hope for the future.
Just for anyone wondering, we are casting the net as widely as possible regarding "disabled poets." If you're not sure you qualify, read!
UK disabled poets: submission guidelines for a Nine Arches disability poetry anthology I'm co-editing. Share widely: 
@AnathemaJane @englishpen @PeterTatchell NOPE NOPE NOPE.

Like come on, it's already had one for like a season. I don't remember her getting any headlines.
When they headline "new gay character" on #TWD, is @huffpostgay forgetting about Tara?
A Right to Cisphobia list? Can we get that done?
Cis ppl get to publicly catalogue their Right to Transphobia but trans women have no right to publicly avoid them. That's how this is.
The only people with any justifiable reason to be hurt by the word "cis" are trans people.
Well, this week's Walking Dead was fantastic.
When Christians call me "divisive" I imagine Moses parting the waves + letting trans + disabled people through first. LOL yes I'm divisive.
Another album that is pretty perfect and I haven't listened to in too long: Civil Wars, "Barton Hollow." You're welcome.
I'm not "divisive" because of what I say. Usually I divide people as soon as I've wheeled into a room + I represent a 3rd division of one.
@sassyphos @MikaMurstein So while I've no interest in decorating mates' houses anymore, I have a lot of ideas around social justice + art.
@sassyphos @MikaMurstein ...years has given me some incentive to try, and some ideas of how to go about it. Art + activism can co-exist.
@sassyphos @MikaMurstein I think, actually, that the "intersection" between fandom + activism which I've discovered in the last few...
@sassyphos @MikaMurstein I have developed a lot of ideas recently for fan art. It's all in my head so that's a start. One day I might do it!
@MikaMurstein ...THIS creative activity was going to reward me, or I wouldn't bother doing it.
@MikaMurstein When I felt I was good enough at poetry, I sent three poems out to a reputable magazine because I promised myself that...
@MikaMurstein ...but I also know it's because in my mind, this creative activity is attached to the pressure of producing without payback.
@MikaMurstein ...I actually find painting + drawing very triggering. I can't work through a picture without tears, basically. Very weird...
@MikaMurstein ...of these people and venues were intending to pay me. That was about the time when I stopped painting + drawing. And now...
@MikaMurstein ...payment. I got a reputation among friends and family for my talent. But when I reached a certain age I realised that none..
@MikaMurstein ...grew up. My family and my friends all praised my ability, and a few nondisabled orgs asked me to produce work without...
@MikaMurstein I totally feel you. Specifically, I used to do a lot of art + illustration. I wanted to be a children's illustrator when I...
@MikaMurstein I'm only now learning to stop being exploited for nondisabled people's pleasure or productivity.
@MikaMurstein This was pretty much my entire young adult life!
My life is dedicated to disability and trans activism, plus telling you that the one Boxcar Racer album you never heard is amazing.
Reminder to new followers that I'm a reverse sexist so please think about your follow carefully.
@LUBOttom Ugh sorry :( Enjoy winding down :D
@LUBOttom Are you doing OK?
@LUBOttom Much better :) Hard day, but 1 or 2 affirming conversations tonight and a couple of glasses of wine with my wife has helped. x
Today has been an exhausting day online.
What I can't be dealing with in manhood (not "men") is that disagreement or agreement with opinions and arguments is all there is.
Dare to say white cis gay men can be gatekeepers of certain words + concepts in queer community + am accused by a gay man of "gay erasure."
Society loves charity because it honours and rewards the privileged. Society hates self-advocates because they tell the truth.
OK. I'm fine. I blocked that transmisogynist.
@Vir_Superanus "assigned male at birth"
@CassandraB They've "exposed" me as not the feminine wallflower I'm supposed to be in order to convince them my gender is really mine?
Cis people: you have the privilege of having people believe you when you assert you are feminine or masculine.
Dear cis women, where's your "softer side"? Because the notion of a "feminine side" sounds like misogyny to me.
Fucking great how amab transfeminine folks are obligated to display a "softer side" or cis women will catch them out as liars.
*packs up gender* Nothing to see here, everyone go home.
Just been told "it looks like your feminine, softer side isn't as feminine as you delude yourself that it is." My gender is cancelled.
@caephyn In my experience, people are only "allies" until they've heard enough and then they're not.
Fan merch has a powerful effect on the brain. I don't even really care how good the film is anymore.
@nanayasleeps &lt;3
I definitely did not expect to be salivating over all the Hasbro Jurassic World toys. Apparently my family saw this coming a mile off.
@nanayasleeps Yeah, I have, but not that particular picture. I'm gonna need to get some of this!
@robotpinemarten There's no way of doing those subtly, you have to go all in. I'm guessing.
@robotpinemarten Thanks! I'll do minimal wax I think for now. I want to see what clips and hair bands might do but a bit scared of that.
Ugh I'm beginning to need to think about how I keep my increasingly-long hair out of my eyes.
I can't avoid my oppression. Why should I let anyone avoid my activism?
You don't get points or cookies for having stuck around long enough to hear an opinion.
If society hasn't handed you a fixed, secure position from which you don't have to move, you have to assert one all by yourself.
The genetic hybrids which populate the Jurassic Park universe were actually only assigned "dinosaur" at birth. How rad is that?
I just transsplained. *high five*
Dear wildlife-related Twitter accounts: please, for the love of God, start captioning your photos with the name of the species.
You can't be neutral on a moving trans.
Violets are blue.
Intentionally misgendering folks
Is a dehumanizing thing to do.
#TransLivesMatter
The amount of people I've supported, signal-boosted, befriended and been a fan of, but they still need to use the word "retard."
Reminder on how I "self-identify": SJW. Chip on my shoulder. Irrational. Sassy. Professional victim. Special snowflake. Flailing girl.
So tired of reading threads and conversations full of abled cis liberals "debating" "eloquently" how much they're entitled to hurt us.
@chloemiriam I've received benefits all my life + will always receive benefits. Anti-benefit rhetoric throws my whole life on the scrapheap.
The extent to which you're allowed to hurt me and oppress me before I walk away and cut contact is not an academic subject.
Roses are red, / Violets are blue, / Love, uh, finds a way. / Henry Wu.
Happy Galentine's Day!
Vince Gilligan should just make everything on TV from now on.
I may be a little bit in love with Ariana Richards.
It's a long, arduous, painful experience to eventually carve out a more safe and happy experience online.
Dear abled people, would it be Awkward if I did /THIS/? *does awkward NSFW thing*

Let's count the songs Frank Sinatra wrote and instruments he played.
I heard a Beyonce song I hadn't heard before in town. Would it've been the new single? I really liked it, anyway.
@applewriter @Gotham3 It's a stag do!
If you need something ridiculously silly to watch, this Jurassic World parody trailer might do it for you: 
And all initially because of clothes and appearance. Gender, eh?
...it's also this big social experiment, affecting all of your interactions with strangers + acquaintances + the way you form relationships.
I guess that before I came out to myself I thought that gender-presentation experimenting was about feeling good about yourself. Yes, but...
Lifehack: Orange squash is nice. Drink it to achieve a better mood.
@AnathemaJane Haha! I'm taking that as an indictment of the UK than yourself, tbh.
I won't list those words because urgh.
Which is much better than everything very gendered I get when I dress "masculine" (or lazy default, as I call it).
Raining when I went out. Now sunny. I made an observation: apparently the more femme I dress, the more likely ppl are to call me "dude."
...covered in hearts and went to town. Felt better. Small victories.
Felt sad this morning, needed to go out but while ill I've lost confidence to dress in anything femme. So I did, wore my pink hat...
@destieluk I think we can be a little bit sad together about that. &lt;3
@destieluk Zombies are red, / And flesh-coloured, / Daryl Dixon amirite?
@rishie_ No I quite like that :)
@destieluk T-Rexes are red-ish, / Mosasaurs are blue (allegedly), / Today is the day before tomorrow. Um, / I love you?
But going back to #EndTheAwkward: I'd rather something like #MakePeaceWithTheAwkward. Not as catchy, for sure.
#LRT Mandarin ducks are FINE things. Have some of those.
That's a seriously anxiety-inducing word, "awkward." Every time I type it I have to make sure I have enough "w"s.
Seems to me we're not considered awkward if we 1) sit down + shut up, or 2) say everything expected of us. Confirmation bias is not awkward.
Tbh, whatever my "goals" were in my activism, I've utterly failed to #EndTheAwkward. Most people find me more awkward than ever.
@The_Wolfster Interacting with disabled people, according to this new @scope campaign.
Cutting to the chase since 1982.
Fuck it, let's enjoy this: "How are YOU going to #EndTheAwkward in the bedroom this Valentine's Day?"
@Sheep_Purple We're definitely not the only ones, not by far. Although shhh we're meant to be quiet about it. Can't say anything awkward.
Just, like, stop. Yeah? Stop it.
I just find it quite hilarious that there are national campaigns aimed at abled people designed to "help them" stop fearing or deriding us.
@Sheep_Purple Can I be a Misandry Sparkle Narwhal? The venus fly trap thing wasn't thought-through; so as long as we can choose.
Just, let's not forget that we wouldn't have to #EndTheAwkward if you lot hadn't felt the need to #StartTheAbleism.
But, well, I hope that #EndTheAwkward helps towards our ultimate goal of abled people considering us human instead of giant Venus Fly Traps.
